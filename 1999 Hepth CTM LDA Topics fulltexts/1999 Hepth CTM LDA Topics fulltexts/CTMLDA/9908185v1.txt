abstract
we present new examples of maverick coset conformal eld theories. they are
closely related to conformal embeddings and exceptional modular invariants.

introduction

the coset construction [1, 2] provides a powerful tool to construct explicit examples of con-
formal eld theories. it has found numerous applications: in superstring theory coset conformal
eld theories with extended supersymmetry have been used to construct string compactica-
tions [3,4,5], and recently the use of the coset construction has been proposed to relate dierent
conformal eld theory descriptions of the fractional quantum hall eect ( [6,7], and references
therein, see also [8]).

the structure of coset theories turns out to be amazingly rich. it is by now well understood
that in the correct treatment of coset conformal eld theories group theoretical selection rules
lead to eld identications, and that eld identication xed points require a special procedure
called xed point resolution [9, 10].

1

the phenomenon of eld identication can be traced back to the following fact: group

theoretical selection rules for the embedding

(g)ik  (gk)

(1)

typically imply that certain branching functions vanish and that non-vanishing branching func-
tions coincide. (here subscripts denote the level, k is an integer and i is the dynkin index
of the embedding.) in particular, there are dierent realizations of states of conformal weight
zero in the coset theory. all these states should be identied to provide a theory with a unique
vacuum. it turns out that this can be done using simple current techniques [9].

it came as a surprise that group theoretical selection rules are not the only reason for
the existence of additional copies of the vacuum. first examples of this phenomenon were
exhibited in [11] and [12]. following these references, we will call maverick coset theory any
coset conformal eld theory which has a non-vanishing branching function of conformal weight
 = 0 that is not a consequence of group theoretical selection rules. an ade-classication for
mavericks was proposed in [12]; however, one more maverick coset theory was found in [10].
the known mavericks share the following features (see more below): they appear at level k = 2,
and for level 1 the embedding is a conformal embedding [13, 14]. in all cases the coset theory
can be cured by use of exceptional modular invariants.

the purpose of this note is twofold. we rst exhibit a dierent class of maverick coset
conformal eld theories which have rather dierent features, but are still closely related to
exceptional modular invariants. secondly, we present a new maverick coset at level k = 2 and
make some general remarks on this type of maverick coset theories.

new maverick coset theories at level k = 1

we start with the embedding

(a1)10  (a3)1 ,

(2)

induced by the four-dimensional representation of a1. the corresponding coset conformal eld
theory has the identication current (j 2/j ) of order two and central charge c = 1/2. hence, if
there is a conformal eld theory corresponding to this coset theory, it can only be the critical
ising model. applying the standard procedure of eld identication [9, 10] to the theory in
question one obtains 11 primary elds; the computation 1 of the conformal weights  for the
branching functions 
 (where  is an integrable highest weight of (g)k = (a3)1 and  is
an integrable highest weight of the subalgebra (g)ik = (a1)10) gives the following values for

the conformal weights expected for the ising model (0, 1/2, 1/16) appear twice, and more-
over conformal weights appear that do not show up in the kac table for the ising model. using
fermionization, it is not hard to show that the following character identities hold:

000( )
010( )
100( ) = 001( ) = 1/16( ) (

= 0( ) (

0( ) +

6( )) + 1/2( ) (
4( )) + 1/2( ) (

4( ) + 
6( ) + 

10( ))
0( ))

(4)

here   denote characters of the ising model,  characters of the ambient algebra g = a3 and
 of the subalgebra g = a1. we observe that those branching functions that have conformal

weights that do not appear in the kac table are indeed vanishing, although they are perfectly
allowed by the group theoretical selection rules. moreover, each ising primary is realized by
dierent branching functions that are not related by the action of simple currents. in particular,
there are more representatives of the vacuum, 000
, so that the coset is clearly maverick.
however, there is indeed an exceptional modular invariant that is exactly suited to make
sense of the coset: at level k = 10 the chiral algebra of a1 allows for an exceptional extension
which leads to an exceptional modular invariant of extension type, the so-called e6 exceptional
modular invariant in the ade-classication of modular invariants [15].

6 = 010

another coset which exhibits similar features is provided by the embedding

(a1)28  (b3)1 ,

(5)

which has an identication current (1/j ) of order two. since it has central charge c = 7/10,
it should be the tricritical ising model.
it is straightforward to check that in this case the
extension leading to the e8-modular invariant of a1 at level k = 28 has to be used.

what is the general pattern behind these mavericks? suppose that the embedding (g)ik 

(g)k allows an intermediate algebra h,

(g)ik  (h)k  (g)k ,

(6)

such that the embedding (g)ik  (h)k is a conformal embedding at level k = 1. we will show
that in this case the coset theory g/g is maverick at level k = 1 if and only if the conformal
embedding does not correspond to an extension by integer spin simple currents.

in the two examples, the relevant conformal embeddings are (a1)10  (b2)1 = (c2)1 and
(a1)28  (g2)1, respectively. other examples, e.g. for g = a2, are easily obtained from the
conformal embeddings

(a2)5
(a2)9
(a2)21

 (a5)1
 (e6)1
 (e7)1

(7)

which correspond to the exceptional extensions of the chiral algebra of a2 that give rise to
modular invariants of a2 of extension type.

we now present an explicit argument which shows that all cosets of the form (6) contain
non-vanishing branching functions of conformal weight zero. to this end we consider the de-
composition of the adjoint representation of the horizontal subalgebra h of h into g irreducible
representations. this decomposition certainly contains the adjoint representation of g, and at
least one more irreducible representation. let  be the highest weight of one such irreducible

3

representation. we claim that in the coset g/g the branching function for 
vacuum of g, is non-vanishing and has conformal weight zero.

, where  is the

the conformal weight / of a coset primary eld 

 is computed according to the formula

/ =    + n ,

(8)

where n is the lowest degree in the ane module h on which the g-module h appears. in
the present situation, we compute n by decomposing the vacuum h of the g-theory in terms
of g modules. the lowest degree contains a single state and therefore only contributes to the
vacuum h of the g-theory. on degree one, the adjoint of g appears. in its decomposition in
h-modules the adjoint of h appears. decomposing the adjoint representation of h further into
g modules, we nd  among the g modules. this module therefore appears at degree one,
n = 1, and moreover, we see that the branching function for 
 is non-vanishing. since  = 
is the vacuum, we obviously have  = 0.

it remains to compute . this is by denition the eigenvalue of the zero mode of the
virasoro algebra obtained by the ane sugawara construction for g. however, since the
embedding g  h is conformal, we can equally well use the zero mode of the virasoro algebra
for h to determine the conformal weight. in terms of h modules, however, the relevant state
appears at degree 1 of the vacuum module and therefore has conformal weight  = 1. we
conclude that the coset conformal weight is / = 0  1 + 1 = 0.
so far our argument applies to any conformal embedding. now we have to consider two
dierent situations: either  is a simple current of the g-theory or not. the rst case happens
when the conformal embedding (g)i  (h)1 is described by an integer spin simple current
extension of g; the identication current (/) will then do the appropriate eld identication,
according to the standard prescription [9, 10].

the second case happens when the embedding does not correspond to a simple current
extension. then clearly the standard prescription does not identify the branching function
with vanishing conformal weight with the vacuum of the coset theory. the coset is therefore
maverick. however, the coset still yields a consistent conformal eld theory, we only have to
use the exceptional extension of the chiral algebra of the g-theory that is provided by the
conformal embedding.

coset conformal eld theories also have a description as gauged wzw--theories. field
identication and xed point resolution that are due to group theoretical selection rules can
be traced back in this language to the fact that a non-simply connected quotient of the real
compact connected lie group corresponding to the embedded algebra has to be gauged [16]. in
this language, the above situation can be described as the rather puzzling observation that at
level k = 1 the subgroup corresponding to g cannot be consistently gauged. rather, one has
inevitably to gauge the larger subgroup corresponding to h to obtain a consistent coset theory.
a deeper understanding of this fact in a lagrangian formulation is not known to us; we would
like to emphasize that this eect exclusively occurs at level k = 1, but not at higher level.

remarkably enough, the present class of theories shows an intimate relation between mav-
erick coset theories, exceptional extensions of the chiral algebra (and therefore exceptional
modular invariants) and conformal embeddings, although here these relations are much less
mysterious than in the coset theories of [11, 12].

some remarks on maverick coset theories at k = 2

the mechanism we have presented for maverick coset theories at level k = 1 does not
extend to the maverick cosets of [11, 12] nor does it provide any insight in the classication of
mavericks of this type. in fact, a rst counterexample to the conjectured ade-classication [12]
of mavericks was provided in [10]. one more example is provided by the coset theory

(d6)2  (a1)2  (e7)2

(9)

the coset theory (9) shares the following four features of the mavericks of [12, 10].

which has c = 4/5 and turns out to be the tetracritical ising model. it is therefore in particular
a counterexample to the conjecture of [12] that maverick cosets have extended w-symmetry.
1) the ambient algebra g is simply laced and at level k = 2; at level k = 1 the embedding is a
conformal embedding.
2) the pair (gc, gc) is a symmetric lie algebra of compact type, where gc and gc stand for the
compact real forms of g and g, respectively.
3) identication currents occur that are trivial for the ambient algebra g, and the branching
functions of vanishing conformal weight  = 0 that are not consequences of group theoretical
selection rules are xed points under these identications.
4) finally, and most remarkably, the following observation of j. fuchs [17] is valid also in
that has conformal weight  = 0 and hence has
this maverick: consider the xed point 0

0
to be identied with the vacuum. for the quantum dimensions of the g-primary 0 and the
g-primary 

0 one has the relation

d0 =

1
0.
2d

(10)

we remark that the coset (9) does not share the property of the mavericks of [11, 12] that
0 appears in the decomposition of the adjoint
0 =  is the adjoint representation and that 
representation of g in g irreducible representations.

the fourth property of maverick cosets seems to be a crucial feature of maverick coset

theories. for example, consider the coset

(a5)2  (a1)2  (e6)2

(11)

with central charge c = 25/28. it shares the rst three properties of mavericks. while it has
an identication current of the form (1/j 3j ) which does have xed points, the ratio of the
quantum dimensions of the g and g primaries of the xed points is in this case not exactly
equal to two, but rather equals

2
2 cos(/7)  2.050858 .

(12)

p2 

one can convince oneself that this coset is in fact not a maverick.

the present examples of maverick coset theories show that a general understanding of eld

identication in coset theories still requires further clarication.
