the recent interest in quantum many body sys-
tems in one space dimension is essentially related to
some applications in modern condensed matter physics.
among others, they include fractional quantum hall ef-
fect [1], high temperature super-conductivity [2], quasi-
one-dimensional organic metals, quantum dots, quantum
wires, etc. some of the just mentioned systems exhibit
properties, which require new physical concepts. signa-
tures of generalized, anyonic statistics (see e.g. [3] and ref-
erences therein) have been observed for instance in exper-
iments with quantum hall bars and in one-dimensional
organic metals. this letter represents a short account of
our recent results [4] concerning the behaviour of anyon
elds at nite temperature and density. the novel fea-
tures we report on, are the existence of anyon condensa-
tion and the presence of persistent currents. our main
tool is an operator formalism for bosonization at nite
temperature and density. we avoid the delicate prob-
lems related with the thermodynamic limit in presence
of anyons, working directly in innite volume.

let us summarize rst the basic points of our approach.

in 1+1 dimensions, which satisfy the equations of motion

we start with a free massless scalar eld  and its dual e

g (x) = g e(x) = 0 ,

(g = diag (1, 1)), the duality constraint

e(x) =  (x) ,

(01 = 1) and the standard equal-time canonical commu-
tation relations. as it is well known, all these require-
ments are fullled by

(x) =

the distribution |k|1
 , whose explicit form is not essen-
tial for our discussion, satises |k||k|1
 = 1. the param-
eter  > 0 has a well understood infrared origin [5]. from
eqs. (5-8) one gets

[z1 (1) , z2 (2)] = i (12) z1 z2

,

(9)

where z = l, r, 12  1  2 and

z1 z2 =(cid:26) 1 if z1 = z2 ,

0 if z1 6= z2 .

we denote by az the algebra generated by z and ob-
serve that

z : z () 7 z ()

(10)

is an automorphism of az . the parameters z will play
the role of chemical potentials associated with the chiral
charges

qz =

jz () =

eq. (9) implies

[qz 1 , z 2()] =

z1 z2

,

[qz 1 , qz 2] = 0 .

(12)

we now turn to generalized statistics, which can be
introduced at purely algebraic level. in fact, let us con-
sider the set of elds parametrized by  = (,  )  r2
and dened by

a(x; )  z(; ) exp(cid:20) i
( qr  ql )(cid:21) 
: exp(cid:8)i(cid:2)r (x) +  l (x+)(cid:3)(cid:9) : ,

2

where z(; ) is a suitable normalization factor and
the normal ordering :
is taken with respect to
{a(k), a(k)}. using eqs. (9,12), one nds for space-like
separated points (x2

:

12 < 0)

(13)

a(x1; )a(x2; ) =
exp[i(2   2)(x1

1  x1

2)]a(x2; )a(x1; ) .

therefore, a(x; ) is an anyon eld whose statistics pa-
rameter [3] is

() = 2   2 .

(15)

bose or fermi statistics are recovered when  is an even
or odd integer respectively. the remaining values of 
lead to abelian braid statistics. what is crucial in im-
plementing of generalized statistics is the relative non-

locality of  and e.

let us concentrate on the family {a(x; ) :   }
with  = {1,1, ..., p,p}.
in [4] we have con-
structed a representation t (; l , r) describing these
elds in thermal equilibrium with inverse temperature
 and chemical potentials r , l . the construction is
in two steps. using the conventional thermal represen-
tation [7] of the commutation relations (7,8) and the
automorphism 
, we rst derive a thermal represen-
tation tz (z ) of az . the representation tz (z ) has
indenite metric and depends on the parameter  and
a bosonic chemical potential b ,
introduced for tech-
nical reasons. the second step consists in determining
t (; l , r)  tl (l )  tr(r) by appropriate selec-
tion rules. referring for all details to [4], we stress that
t (; l , r) is both - and b -independent and has pos-
itive metric. the basic correlation functions characteriz-
ing this physical representation are

which is the origin of non-vanishing charge density and
persistent current.

the explicit form of the correlators is quite remarkable
and deserves a comment. without current insertions, the
equal-time n-point function (16) is a nite temperature
and density generalization of the jastrow-laughlin wave
function [1]. we recall that the latter describes the n-
particle ground state in several one-dimensional models,
showing a tomonaga-luttinger liquid structure. in that
context, the current insertions in (16) are associated with
the charged excitations of the liquid. the expectation
values (16,18) are invariant under the transformations:

a(x; )  a(x0 + t, x1; ) ,
a(x; )  eis
 a(x; ) ,
a(x; )  eisl  a(x; ) ,

r

jz ()  jz ( + t) ,
jz ()  jz () ,
jz ()  jz () ,

with t, sz  r. if one denotes the corresponding con-
served charges by h and qz and considers the automor-
phism s, generated by

k  h  l ql  r qr ,

(20)

one can prove [4] that the correlation functions (16,18)
obey the kubo-martin-schwinger condition relative to
s with (inverse) temperature . clearly, this result is
fundamental for the physical interpretation of the repre-
sentation t (; l , r).

expressed in terms of z , the hamiltonian h reads

h =z 



d [r() + l ()] .

in order to get a deeper insight into the physical prop-
erties of the eld a(x; ), it is instructive to derive the
relative momentum distribution. for this purpose we
consider the fourier transform

inserting the explicit expression (see eq.

observing that the contributions of the left- and right-
moving modes factorize, we consider rst the cases

and

cw (, k; (, 0)) = 2(  k)(cid:0)r  + k; 2, (cid:1) , (24)
cw (, k; (0,  )) = 2( + k)(cid:0)l   k;  2, (cid:1) . (25)

eqs. (24,25) have a simple physical interpretation: the -
factors x the dispersion relations, whereas the -factors
give the momentum distributions. from the exchange
relation (14) we already know that the elds a(x; (1, 0))
in agreement
and a(x; (0,1)) have fermi statistics.
with this fact, one gets from (24,25)

cw (, k; (1, 0)) = 2(  k)
cw (, k; (0,1)) = 2( + k)

we thus recover the familiar fermi distribution (with
fermi momenta kf =  r and kf =  l), which rep-
resents an useful check. turning back to the general ex-
pression (23), we see that for  > 0 the distribution  is
a smooth positive function, whose asymptotic behaviour
is encoded in

fig. 1. the distribution (k; ,  = 1) for  = 1 (dashed
line) and  = 0.1 (continuous line).
in the range   1,  is monotonically increasing on the
whole line k  r. when 0 <  < 1,  increases monoton-
ically for k  0 and, according to eqs. (28,29), admits
at least one local maximum for k > 0. let us denote the
position of the rst one (when k moves from 0 to ) by
it is easily seen that kc (, ) = 1sc (),
kc (, ).
where sc () is a solution of certain functional equa-
tion, which is not displayed for the sake of conciseness.
we have some numerical evidence that the maximum
kc (, ) is unique. the plots of  in fig. 1 indicate
an interesting condensation-like behaviour around kc .
for comparison we have plotted there for  = 1 the
cases  = 1 (fermi distribution) and  = 0.1. the
phenomenon is clearly marked for small values of the
temperature and/or of the parameter  in the domain
0 <  < 1. we nd quite remarkable that for any xed
temperature, one can achieve an arbitrary sharp anyon
condensation, taking a suciently small value of . con-

cerning the behaviour of cw (, k; ) when both  6= 0

and  6= 0, the above analysis implies condensation at

 = kc (2, ) + kc ( 2, )  r   l  ,

(30)

k = kc (2, )  kc ( 2, )  r  + l  ,

(31)

provided that 0 < 2 < 1 and 0 <  2 < 1 we stress
that the condensation eect we discovered, does not con-
tradict the hohenberg-mermin-wagner (hmw) theorem
on the absence of condensation in one space dimension.
the point is that anyonic statistics can be equivalently
described by a suitable exchange interaction with two-
and three-body potentials, determined [6] by the corre-
sponding exchange factor. when these potentials are
conning, some assumptions of the hmw theorem are
violated and condensation may occur [8], [9] even in one
dimension. summarising, we have shown that the right
(left) moving modes of the anyon eld a(x; ) condensate
in the range 0 < 2 < 1 (0 <  2 < 1).

the thermal representations t (; l , r) have univer-
sal character. as a concrete application, let us consider
the 2-d thirring model. classically, the model describes
a two-component eld  satisfying the equation of mo-

tion

i (x) = g [(x) (x)](x) ,

(32)

where g  r is the coupling constant and

(x) =(cid:18) 1(x)

2(x)(cid:19) , 0 =(cid:18) 0 1

1 0 (cid:19) .
1 0(cid:19) , 1 =(cid:18) 0 1

both the vector and the chiral current,

t00(x) = t11(x)  l(x+) + r(x) ,
t01(x) = t10(x)  l(x+)  r(x) ,

which lead to the energy and momentum densities

in conclusion, we have shown that nite temperature
and density anyon systems in 1+1 dimensions exhibit
condensation and persistent currents. these phenomena
deserve further attention both from the conceptual and
applicative point of view.

the problem of quantizing this system at nite tem-

with the charges q and q5 and generated by the cur-
rents (33), has been solved in [4]. we have constructed
there an anyonic solution (see also [10]) with statisti-
cal parameter  > g. the basic building block of our
construction is the representation t (t ; l , r) where

referring again for details to [4], we observe that the

the expression for the charge density resolves some dis-

of [13] and extending it to the case  6= 1. the ap-
pearance of a persistent current hj1(x)i
in the nite
temperature thirring model represents to our knowledge
a novel feature. let us recall in this respect that per-
sistent currents of quantum origin have been experimen-
tally observed ( [11], [12]) in mesoscopic rings placed in
an external magnetic eld. such elds are absent in the
two-dimensional world, but chiral symmetry, combined
with duality still allow for a non-vanishing hj1(x)i
