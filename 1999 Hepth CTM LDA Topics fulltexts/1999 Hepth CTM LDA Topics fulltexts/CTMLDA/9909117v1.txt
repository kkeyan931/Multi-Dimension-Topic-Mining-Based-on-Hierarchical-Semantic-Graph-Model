abstract

the extended yang-mills gauge theory in euclidean space is a renormalizable
(by power counting) gauge theory describing a local interacting theory of scalar,
vector, and tensor gauge elds (with maximum spin 2). in this article we study
the quantum aspects and various generalizations of this model in euclidean
space. in particular the quantization of the pure gauge model in a common
class of covariant gauges is performed. we generalize the pure gauge sector by
including majorana fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge group.
we show that the maximum half-integer spin contained in this model in dimen-
sion 4 is 3/2 and that this model is also supersymmetric. moreover we develop
an extension of this theory so as to include internal gauge symmetries and the
coupling to matter elds which are in the fundamental representation of the
gauge group.

1 introduction

the interacting theories of higher spin elds [1] have attracted a great attention
mostly because of the relevant role played by the spin-2 eld graviton which, it is well
known, should couple to any kind of particle. there is no doubt about the existence of
higher spin composite particles in nature, a classical example is given by the observed
hadronic resonances. however, up to now, no elementary particle with spin higher
then 1 has been observed (among these the graviton).

the main theoretical problems which aect the construction of a consistent inter-
acting theory of elementary higher spin elds [2] in minkowski space can be briey
summarized as follows: one must require the cancellation of all negative-norm states,
a cancellation which is performed by means of higher-spin gauge invariances. these
local invariances, though, impose too many restrictions (on the interacting terms)
which cannot be satised in many circumstances. these restrictions can be circum-
vented by relaxing some basic requirements of quantum eld theory. indeed a general
class of consistent interacting higher-spin gauge theories in dimension 4,3, and 2 exists
and describes innitely many elds containing all the spins [3]. in the formulation
of these theories, though, in order to implement the gauge symmetries, necessary to
eliminate all the negative norm states, innitely many auxiliary elds must be intro-
duced. this mechanism induces higher derivatives in the interaction terms and these
in turn give rise to non-locality [1]. these theories are of interest, however, since
they also establish a connection with string models, even though in the latter all the
elementary higher spin excitations beyond the graviton are massive [4].

up to now in minkowski space, the only consistent local interacting eld theories of
massless spin higher then 1/2 are the usual abelian and non-abelian yang-mills (ym)
gauge theories for the spin-1 [5], the gravity for the spin-2 [6], and the supergravity
theories [7] for both the spin-2 and spin-3/2. in addition if one requires these theories
to be also renormalizable then the above list would further shorten since it does not
contain the gravitational interactions. at present string theories, where gravity is
consistently coupled to matter and gauge elds of any spin [4], are largely believed
to play a central role in the solution of all these problems.

in this paper we analyze a gauge theory of higher spin interactions in a at eu-
clidean space-time. in this space, in fact, we shall see that many of the restrictions,
necessary to avoid the cancellations of negative-norm states, can be relaxed. this
property enables us to construct a general class of renormalizable higher spin gauge
theories which are not allowed in minkowski space. this approach was rst intro-
duced a number of years ago in [8] where an extension to the abelian gauge theory with
scalar, vector, and tensor gauge elds was proposed in euclidean space. this model

3

is described (in a at space-time) by a non-abelian gauge theory of the yms type
where the connection eld takes values in the usual cliord algebra of spinors. here
the scalar, vector, and tensor elds can be identied as the components of the gauge
connection along the cliord algebra basis. an interesting aspect of this model is that
the gauge transformations mix dierent irreducible representations of the space-time
rotation group. in addition, it is worth noting that, in four dimensions the content
of the maximum spin of the gauge multiplet is a spin-2 and the full interacting la-
grangian is renormalizable by power counting. this model, in the full basis of cliord
algebra, contains three spin-2 elds: two of them are in a standard representation of
the rotation group and are described by a symmetric traceless tensor of rank two,
whereas the remaining one is contained in one of the irreducible representations of a
tensor of rank-3 with two antisymmetric indices [8]-[10].
the gauge spin-2 elds do not have the usual coupling to the energy momentum ten-
sor while they do couple to the lowest spin particles in a consistent way. moreover
the free gauge transformations of the standard spin-2 elds coincide with the usual
spin-2 gauge transformations of the fierz-pauli eld [11].
this theory is well formulated in an euclidean space where the gauge group is compact
and, being a yms type gauge theory, it should satisfy also the osterwalder-schrader
axioms [12]. therefore it is possible to quantize this theory by means of the standard
path integral method applied to gauge theories. in refs.[8],[10] it was pointed out that
problems with unitarity of the s matrix could arise when this theory is formulated
directly into a minkowski space (where the gauge group is non-compact) because of
unwanted ghost states.

in this theory the coleman-mandula theorem [13] (which forbids any continuous
symmetry of the s matrix that mixes internal and external degrees of freedom through
a commuting lie algebra) is circumvented, mainly because this theory is formulated
in euclidean space.

recently in ref.[10] an interesting proposal to include fermions in the model in[8]
has been given. whereas in ref.[10] only the sub-group so(4) is considered, in this
article we shall see that it is straightforward to extend these couplings to the larger
group u(4) which was rst considered in ref.[8].
in this work we show that the
model in [8] is supersymmetric when majorana fermions are added to the action in
the adjoint representation of the gauge group.

the paper is organized as follows. in section [2] we briey recall the model pro-
posed in ref.[8] and analyze the free particle spectrum. in section [3] we quantize
this model in a covariant gauge and give the expression for the ghost lagrangian. in
section [4], by following the approach of ref.[10], we generalize the model in [8] by
including majorana fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge group and an-

4

alyze its supersymmetric properties. in section [5] we extend the model in [8] so as to
include the standard internal gauge symmetries. the expression for the unied gauge
lagrangian, which includes the internal su(n) gauge group, is given together with
the corresponding innitesimal gauge transformations. in section [6] we study the
coupling of the extended gauge elds with the matter elds in the fundamental rep-
resentation and make some remarks on possible couplings with ordinary matter and
gauge elds in euclidean space. finally the last section is devoted to our conclusions.

2 pure gauge action

in the model proposed in ref.[8] the usual abelian gauge transformations have been
extended to non-abelian ones which mix elds of dierent integer spin. as a con-
sequence the elements of the gauge group transform non-trivially under coordinate
rotations. in addition the lagrangian, which is invariant under these extended gauge
transformations, describes a local interacting gauge theory of higher spin elds. this
model has the attractive feature that it is renormalizable by power counting. (we
believe that the model is also fully renormalizable, however we do not tackle this issue
in the present article.) moreover another interesting characteristic is that the maxi-
mum value of the spin contents (s) of the gauge multiplet is xed by the space-time
dimension d; in particular for d = 4 we have s = 2.

before presenting our analysis we briey recall the model proposed in ref.[8]. one
rst considers a spinorial-vectorial eld aij
 (x) in euclidean four dimensional space,
where i and j are indices which belong to the dirac spinorial space (i, j = 1, . . . , 4). in
particular this eld is dened to transform under the euclidean coordinate rotation2

x  x =  

 x, with  

  

 = 



as follows

a(x)  a(x) = s() a(x)s1() 
 .

(1)

(2)

note that in (2) s() is the usual spinorial representation of the rotation group o(4)
which is given by

s() = exp (


4

), with s()s()1() = 

,

(3)

2 we use the convention to sum up the same indices and the euclidean metric is given by

 = 

 = diag(1, 1, 1, 1).

5

where  is a function 3 of ,  = [, ]/2, and  are the usual dirac matrices
satisfying the relation {, } = 2. in ref.[8] it was pointed out that it is very
useful to decompose the eld a along the cliord algebra basis; this is done in the
following manner

a(x) = a(x)1i + a(x)5 + t(x) + t(x)5 + c(x)


2

,

(4)

where 1i is the unity matrix in the cliord algebra. indeed in this decomposition
the indices of the elds which label the cliord algebra basis are vectorial indices
under o(4) rotations (the reader can easily check this property by means of eqs.(2)
and (3)). this implies that the elds a, t (and analogously t ) and c,
respectively, transform as a vector and tensors of rank 2 and 3.
it is worth observing that some components of a, namely t, t, and c, can
be further decomposed in irreducible representation of o(4) as follows

t =

where  is the complete antisymmetric tensor. we now give some clarications
about the elds appearing in eq.(5):  and  are scalars, b and b are vectors
while s is a symmetric traceless tensor of rank-2. the elds v s
 (and
s,a
analogously v
 ) are antisymmetric tensors in the (1,0) and (0,1) representations,
respectively. (note that with the notation (x,y) we refer to the usual su(2)  su(2)
complex spinorial representation of the rotation group o(4).) the tensor elds ds

and da
 belong to the (3/2, 1) and (1, 3/2) representations respectively; they are
antisymmetric in the ,  indices and are traceless. moreover v (s,a)
and d(s,a)
satisfy the following self-duality conditions [10]

 and v a

the exact relationship between  and  can be found, for example, in ref. [16].

 and v (s,a)

where the signs (+) and () refer to (s) and (a) respectively. 4
we now see that, by using the self-duality conditions (6), the d(s,a)
tensor
elds have 8 and 3 degrees of freedom, respectively. note that, if the elds are
massive[14], a spin-2 eld is contained in each of the tensors s, s and d(s,a)
 . on
the contrary, if the spin-2 elds are massless, according to the weinberg theorem[14]
only the left-handed and right-handed polarizations are consistently described by the
ds
 elds, respectively. therefore, if parity is conserved, one may conclude
that a massless spin-2 can be described by the reducible eld d = ds
.
returning to the model in [8], the succeeding step is to promote the eld a to a
gauge connection by requiring that a transforms under a local gauge transformation
u(x) as follows

 and da

 (x) = u(x) a(x)u1 +

u(x)u1(x),

(7)

g

where u(x), which belongs to u(4), acts on the spinorial indices of a. in [8] it is
required that the new gauge eld ag
 should transform, under coordinate rotations,
as a in eq.(2). because of this requirement the transformation (under coordinate
rotations) properties of u(x)

u(x) = s()u(x)s1()

(8)

also follow.
now by means of the exponential representation one can express u(x) as follows

where

(x) = (x)1i + (x)5 + (x) + (x)5 + (x)

u(x) = exp {(x)},

(9)

(10)

.

note that the indices which label the basis in eq.(10), due to the transformation
in (8) and eq.(3), transform as vectorial indices under coordinate rotations. finally
the compact expression of the lagrangian le, which is invariant under the gauge
transformations (7), is given by

le(x) =
f(x) =  a   a + g[ a, a],

(11)
4we recall that in minkowski space it is not possible to impose self-dual (or antiself-dual) condi-
tions on real elds. the self- (or antiself) duality conditions can be imposed only on complex elds.
therefore in minkowski space each combination v s
ds

, which appear in eq.(5), are replaced by only one irreducible eld representation.

 (and analogously the v

where in the above expression the commutator and the trace are taken on the cliord
algebra. by using the component elds given in (4), the lagrangian in (11) takes the

clearly the a is a free eld since it corresponds to the u(1) gauge connection of
u(4) and the interacting theory is described by the su(4) gauge group. note that
the smallest sub-algebra of su(4) is given by the  generators which belong to the
algebra of so(4). the smallest gauge lagrangian, which is invariant under the so(4)
gauge transformations, is given by the terms in (13-15) containing only the c eld.
the latter was considered in ref.[10].

one interesting aspect of this model is that the lagrangian (12) can be written
in terms of the o(4) irreducible representations by inserting the elds decomposition
(5) in the expressions (13)-(15) (see [8]). then the corresponding innitesimal gauge
transformations for the irreducible elds are obtained by means of the standard de-
composition method, as previously shown in eq.(16). for example, the corresponding
innitesimal gauge transformations for , s, v (s,a)

are given by

with the obvious generalization for the other elds. the expression for the lagrangian
containing only the c eld, in terms of the irreducible representation, can be found
in ref.[10].

we here analyze the physical degrees of freedom and the free particle spectrum
in order to do so we restrict our analysis by only
of the model introduced in [8].
considering the free lagrangian l0 which is invariant under the abelian sector5 of the
gauge transformations. we rst consider6 the free lagrangian l0(t ) in eq.(13) which
contains only the tensor eld t. from eq.(16) we see that it is possible to make a
gauge transformation which ensures

s = 0 and  = 0.

(18)

5by abelian sector of the gauge transformations we mean the non-omogeneous terms in eq.(16)

containing only the derivatives.

6 in this analysis we do not consider the free particle spectrum described by the elds a and

a since it is clear from (13) that they describe two massless spin-1 elds.

9

this result is justied in the following manner. the free gauge transformations for
the eld s = s + 1/4 are given by  s =  + . then, by means
of these gauge transformations, the rst constraint in (18) can be imposed. this
constraint, when the on-shell massless equations for s and  are used, is invariant
under a new gauge transformation. this new gauge degree of freedom allows us to
eliminate the component of the on-shell massless scalar eld . (note that the gauge
transformations for the eld s and the gauge xing in (18) are the same ones en-
countered in the spin-2 eld of the fierz-pauli lagrangian.) by adopting the gauge
xing (18) all the gauge degrees of freedom are used and no new constraint on t
can be imposed. in particular no constraint may be introduced for the antisymmetric
tensor eld t a
 = v s
now if the elds v (s,a)
, in the (1,0) and (0,1) representation elds, were massive then
they would describe two spin-1 elds. however since they are massless elds, accord-
ing to the weinberg theorem [14], only one massless spin-1 eld can be associated
to the (1, 0) (0, 1) representation, where the right- and left-handed polarization are
contained in the (1,0) and (0,1) representation, respectively. here the two residual
degrees of freedom are contained in the longitudinal components. these degrees are
associated to the transverse polarizations of the vectorial eld l  t . indeed
these polarizations cannot be gauged out in this model. the only components of the
reducible tensor t which can be gauged out correspond to the vector t .

 + v a
.



as a consequence the physical polarizations of the eld t, in the momentum
space k, are the transverse ones t (s)
(k) (where (s) and (a) refer to
the symmetric and antisymmetric tensor in  and , respectively) and longitudinal
ones l

(k) which satisfy the following conditions

(k) and t (a)





kt (a)



(k) = 0,

kt (s)



(k) = 0,

kl

(k) = 0,

(19)



 has not a denite symmetry in ,  and kl
(k) and t (a)

note that in the above relations l
(k) 6=
0. from eq.(19) we have t (s)
(k) each contain only two independent
polarizations. on the contrary in l
 there are four independent polarizations, each
of which correspond to one massless spin-1 and two scalars. as a result the on-shell
t eld describes the following spectrum: one massless spin-2, two massless spin-1,
and two massless scalars. therefore in total we count 3  2 + 2  1 = 8 degrees of
freedom for the on-shell t eld; this result is in agreement with the naive counting
based on the gauge degrees of freedom.



we next analyze the particle spectrum described by the free lagrangian l0(c) in
eq.(13) which contains only the eld c. we can use the gauge degrees of freedom

c  c + 

10

(20)

in order to set the following transversality constraints on the elds d(s,a)



d(s,a)

 = 0.

(21)

the results in ref.[14] enable us to see that in the massless case the d(s)
 which sat-
ises eq.(21) describes two degrees of freedom. these degrees of freedom correspond
to a right-handed spin-2 and a right-handed spin-1 eld. analogously we can see that
the d(a)
 describes the corresponding left-handed ones. therefore, since in this model
parity is conserved, the physical polarizations of the reducible eld d(s)
 will
describe a massless spin-2 and spin-1 eld.

 + d(a)

as a result of the gauge-xing in (21) there are no gauge degrees of freedom
available which would enable us to eliminate other components in the vector elds b
and b. thus the eld b contains 4 independent polarizations. the two transverse
one (respect to the three-momentum) correspond to a massless spin-one polarizations
whereas the longitudinal ones are associated with massless scalar elds. the spectrum
for b is obtained analogously. as a result the on-shell c eld describes the
following massless spectrum: one spin-2, three spin-1, and four scalar elds; so in
total we count respectively 4  2 + 4  1 = 12 degrees of freedom, in agreement
with the naive counting based on the gauge degrees of freedom.
it is clear that the on-shell particle contents of this model is gauge invariant and
one can reach the same conclusions on the spectrum by using dierent choices for
the gauge xing. finally we note that the scalar particles (or longitudinal photons)
which appear in the spectrum are strictly connected to the fact that some longitudinal
components of the tensor or vector elds can not be gauged out.

3 covariant quantization

when the model in [8] is quantized in the euclidean space the negative norm states
are absent since the space-time metric is the  and the gauge group is compact.
moreover, due to the compactness of the gauge group, the theory can be quantized
by means of the standard path integral method. clearly the fact that the theory is well
dened in euclidean space it is not enough to guarantee its analytical continuation to
the minkowski one. even if the osterwalder-schrader (os) axioms are satised, and
in particular the property of reection positivity [12] is veried, one cannot use here
the reconstruction theorems 7 of ref.[12]. indeed, in the proof of these theorems, the

7 these theorems guarantee that the wightman functions (which satisfy the wightman axioms)
can be completely reconstructed from the analytical continuation of the corresponding schwinger

11

gauge group is not changed by the analytical continuation to the minkowski space.
on the contrary in the model in [8], in order to maintain the lorentz covariance, we
must rotate the gauge group u(4) to the non-compact one u(2, 2) when the analytical
continuation to minkowski space is performed.

now we begin our analysis of the quantum aspects of this model by considering
only the interacting theory given by the su(4) gauge group. the canonical quanti-
zation imposes the following commutation rules for the elds t and c

h a
 (x, t), a(y, t)i = 3(x  y),
ht
(x, t), t(y, t)i = 3(x  y),
ht
(x, t), t (y, t)i = 3(x  y),
hc
(x, t), c(y, t)i = 3(x  y)

2

(  ) ,

(22)

where the  a,t,t ,c are the momentum conjugates of the corresponding a, t , t and
c elds respectively. if we generalize this theory in minkowski space, by substituting
the metric  with g in the lagrangian (13-15) and consequently in the commutation
rules 22, from eqs. (22) we see that negative norm states can be generated by some
a0, ti0, t io, ci0j and t0i, t oi, c0ij where
component elds. namely these are:
the indices i and j take values on to the space components. then the problem of
considering this theory in minkowski space arises due to the presence of the negative
norm states (generated by the a0, ti0, t io, ci0j components) which cannot be gauged
out. 8

now we analyze the covariant quantization of the model [8] in euclidean space
and in the most common class of covariant gauges. the path integral representation
of the generating functional of the green functions w [j] can be formally written as

w [j] = z d ad d  exp(cid:26)z d4x(cid:16)le + lgf + lgh  t r( j a)(cid:17)(cid:27) ,

(23)

where le is the full lagrangian given in eq.(12) and lgf and lgh correspond to
the gauge-xing and the ghost lagrangian, respectively. in the last term the trace is
taken on the cliord algebra and j, which can be decomposed as a in eq.(4), is
the source for the gauge eld a.

functions, provided that these last one satisfy the axioms in [12].

8 it should be interesting to see if a lorentz invariant hilbert subspace, where the theory is

unitary and the unphysical states decouple from the physical amplitudes, exists.

12

in the present study we consider the general class of covariant gauges whose gauge

xing lagrangian is given by

lgf =

[(  a(cid:17)2 + tt  + t t



(24)

in this gauge the free propagators pab (in momentum space k) for the elds a,
t, t  and c are given by

the propagators in the basis of the o(4) irreducible representations can be easily ob-
tained from eqs.(25) by means of the standard decomposition methods. note that the
propagators in eqs.(25) are diagonal in the basis of the o(4) irreducible representa-
tions only in the thooft-feynman gauge  = 1. however in the standard calculations
of the scattering amplitudes it is more convenient to work with the propagators in
the basis of the reducible elds t, t  and c instead of the irreducible ones.
by applying the standard methods with the gauge xing in (24) we obtain the fol-
lowing ghost lagrangian

the ghost multiplet, which appears in eqs.(27), is composed by the following elds:
a complex scalar , two complex vectors , , and a complex antisymmetric tensor

13

, all of which are grassman variables. note that the vectorial ghost elds always
appear when gauge spin-2 elds are present, a classical example is the quantum
gravity.

now we briey discuss the gauge-invariant regularization of this model. due to
the presence of the 5 matrix in the gauge cliord algebra basis, it is clear that the
usual dimensional-regularization is not suitable for this model. in order to solve this
problem, in ref.[10] it is suggested to adopt the operator regularization scheme [15].
here we want to point out that there exists another possible su(4) gauge invariant
regularization scheme for this theory: this is provided by means of the corresponding
wilson action on the lattice [17].
indeed on the lattice the cliord algebra basis
is taken in 4 dimensions and the above mentioned problem of 5 does not exist.
moreover, even though the fermions matter elds are coupled to the gauge connection,
the lattice regularization does not spoil the su(4) gauge symmetry. indeed, as we will
show later on, the generator corresponding to the gauge transformation containing
the 5 matrix is not connected to the standard chiral transformations and so the
wilson term, which is necessary to solve the doubling problem, does respect the gauge
symmetry. clearly, when fermions are added to the theory, the wilson term breaks
the (global) standard chiral symmetry.

4 supersymmetric extension

in this section we consider the couplings of the gauge eld a to fermion matter elds
which are in the adjoint representation of the gauge group. in ref. [10] these couplings
have been proposed, and the smallest gauge sub-group so(4) studied. we generalize
this approach by considering the larger group su(4). in addition we consider the
matter elds to be majorana fermions and show that in this case the theory is also
invariant under global supersymmetric transformations.

in order to implement these couplings we dene in euclidean space the following
majorana fermion multiplet ij
k where the up indices i, j and the down index k are
the usual dirac indices. before giving the coordinate transformation rules of ij
k some
denitions are in order. in addition to the spinorial representation of the rotation
group s() we introduce another independent spinorial representation s() of the
o(4) rotation. the matrix s(), in terms of a new cliord algebra basis

i = 1i, 5, , 5, 5, ,

(28)

(where 1i is the unity matrix) is assumed to commute with s() and to have the
same representation as s() (see eq.(3) ). note that each element of the i basis is

14

assumed to commute with any other element of the cliord i basis.

now we can dene the following coordinate transformation properties of ij

k in

euclidean space, these are

ij
k (x)   ij
or in a more compact notation

 x,

x  x =  
k (x) = skm()nsia() ab

(x)  (x) = s()ns1() (x)s()o

and analogously for the adjoint eld



(29)

(31)

(34)

(x) 

(x) = ns1()

(x)s()o s()1,

where the multiplication of s() and s() matrices acts on the up and down dirac
indices, respectively. note that the s() matrix in eq.(30) is the same matrix ap-
pearing in the coordinate transformation rule of the gauge potential in eq.(2). we
now decompose the eld  on the same basis i of the a eld as follows

jk

i = i(5)jk +

(32)

in the sequel the notation for the spinorial down index i in the component elds,
appearing in (32), will be suppressed. as a consequence of the coordinate transfor-
mations (30), the component elds ,  (or analogously 5), and  transform in
the following manner

there  (resp.  and ) transform as a spin-1/2 a (resp. spin-3/2) eld. we
now require that 5,  
5 , and  are anticommuting majorana elds satisfying the
condition

c  c t = ,

15

where t is the transpose and the charge conjugation matrix c satises the following
properties cc = 1 and c1 = c. 9
can be decomposed
into irreducible representations of the o(4) coordinate transformations as follows 10

it is interesting to observe that the majorana elds

where

the elds , 5,  , ( resp. , 
5 , , ) describe spin-1/2 (resp. spin-3/2) majo-
rana eld. by means of eq.(33) it is straightforward to prove that the decompositions
(35) are o(4) irreducible. moreover the property that the elds in the r.h.s. of (35)
are majorana elds follows from fact that , , 5 and  satisfy the condition
(34). this can be easily checked by applying the eq. (34) to the decomposition (35).
in order to couple the eld  to the gauge connection a we need to require that,

under the gauge transformations u(x), the eld  transforms as follows

ij
k (x)  gij

k

(x) = u ia(x) ab

k (x)ubj(x).

as a result the covariant derivative d acting on  is given by

(37)

(38)

(39)

d  =    gh , ai ,

where the commutator is taken on the i cliord algebra basis and g is the same
coupling appearing in the lagrangian (12). finally the gauge invariant lagrangian l 
for the fermion sector (in the adjoint representation of the gauge group) is

lf =

1

8 nt r(cid:16)  (cid:17)  gt r(cid:16) h , ai(cid:17)o ,

9in the following we will use the notation  for any component fermionic eld which transforms
as   s1 under coordinate rotations o(4). we recall that in euclidean space  =  for any
fermionic eld .
10 the spinorial indices i,j appearing in (35) have been temporary reintroduced to avoid confu-

sions with the notation, and the same indices are intended to be summed up.

where the following relations for anticommuting majorana elds a,b

(40)

ab = ba,

ab = ba

(41)

were used. note that in eq.(40) we have eliminated from the notation the bar over
the  matrices since in the following we work only with the component elds along
the i basis. the lagrangian (40) is not written in the components of o(4) irreducible
representation, but this can be easily obtained by taking into account the decompo-
sitions (5) and (35). we observe that nontrivial couplings between the irreducible
representation of the gauge and fermion elds can arise in the interacting lagrangian
li
f . after some straightforward algebraic manipulations, in terms of the fermion
irreducible representations (35), the free lagrangian l0

f is, up to total derivatives,

one of the most important issues of the extended gauge theory containing majo-
rana fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge group is that the total action
stot

is invariant under global supersymmetric (susy) transformations. note that in (44)
the where le and lf are the ones given in eq.(12) and eq.(39), respectively, and the
auxiliary elds d, d,d, and d (with d being an antisymmetric tensor) should
be added to the lagrangian in order to close the o-shell susy algebra. this result is
obtained by generalizing the susy transformations of the pure n=1 super ym gauge
theory (with internal gauge group) to our case. in components these transformations
are given by

before concluding the present section we underline the characterizing properties
of the above introduced supersymmetric extension. the extended gauge symmetry
mixes elds of dierent spin but with the same statistics. on the contrary a susy
transformation mixes elds of dierent statistic. moreover, due to the fact that the
maximum spin of the gauge-charges is spin-1 and the susy charges have spin-1/2,
the transformations which leave invariant the total action, can mix elds of spin-s
with elds of spin-(s  s), where s = 1 and s = 1/2 correspond to a gauge
and susy transformation, respectively. finally the product of a susy and gauge
transformation can produce a |s| = 3/2 spin-transition.

5 internal symmetries

in this section we generalize the model in [8] so as to include the standard internal
gauge symmetries. this is eected by restricting our choice to the compact groups
su(n).

this generalization is obtained by considering a lie group whose algebra is given
by the tensorial product of the cliord and u(n) algebra bases. it is important to
note that the elements given by the tensorial product of the unity matrix of su(n)
with the cliord algebra basis are necessary in order to close the algebra. as a conse-
quence we have (in 4 dimensions) a lie group containing 16n 21 generators, which
form the algebra (in euclidean space) of su(4  n). the corresponding elements
of the extended algebra (which we call y ) containing internal symmetries generators
can be represented in the compact form

11 we recall that in order to make a comparison (by using the notation of (48)) between eqs. (35)

y a

i = ni  1it, i  ta, 1i  tao ,

(49)

and (48), the bar over the  matrices in (35) should be eliminated.

19

where the symbol  indicates the standard tensorial product between the matrices
i (of the cliord algebra basis) and ta (of su(n)), 1i, and 1it are the unity
matrix of i and su(n) respectively. by i we denote any element of the reduced
cliord algebra basis which does not contain 1i. the matrices ta satisfy the following
commutation and anticommutation rules

[ta, tb] = if abctc,

{ta, tb} = 2cf ab1it + dabctc,

[ta, i] = 0,

(50)

where the following normalizations are used t r(tatb) = 1/2ab and cf = 1/(2n)
for the ta matrices in the fundamental representation. the structure function dabc
is a complete symmetric tensor with null traces dabcab = 0.

this y algebra was proposed a long time ago in refs.[18],[19] in the context of
the relativistic extensions of the su(6) model [20] for the strong interactions (the
corresponding lie structure functions can be found in ref.[18]). we want to stress
that, although there is a coincidence of the symmetry group, there is no analogy
between the model in [8] and the model proposed in refs.[18],[19], and the theoretical
inconsistencies [21] which are present in the latter do not aect the theory of the
model in [8].

now we give the generalization of the gauge transformations (7)-(10) by including
the internal symmetries generated by the group su(4  n). we begin with the
unitary gauge group element u(x) which is given by

u(x) = exp {  1it + a(x) (ta  1i) + a(x) (ta  5) + a

(x) (ta  )

+ a

(x) (ta  i5) + a

(x) ta 



2!) ,

(51)

where  is given in eq.(10). we require that u(x) transforms as u(x) in eq.(8)
under coordinate transformations. then, due to eq.(3) and to the fact that the
su(n) generators commute with the o(4) transformations [ta, s()] = 0, only the
greek indices in the i parameters in (51), transform like vectorial indices under
o(4) coordinate transformations.
for the generalization of the gauge potential a we may proceed in the same way.
we dene a to have the same coordinate and gauge transformation properties of
a in (2) and (7) respectively. then we decompose a along the y algebra basis in
(49) as follows 12

a = a  1it + aa

(x) (ta  1i) + aa

(x) (ta5  1i) + t a

(x) (ta  )

12 to avoid confusion note that the symbols ta and t a

 indicate the su (n ) generators and the

tensor elds along the  ta basis respectively.

20

+ t a

(x) (ta  i5) + c a

(x) ta 



2! ,

(52)

where the expression of a is given in eq.(4). as in the case of a, the greek
indices of the component elds in (52) transform like vectorial indices under the o(4)
coordinate transformations.

the pure ym lagrangian in terms of the a eld which generalizes (12), so as to

include the local internal symmetries, has the same formal expression of (12)

lis(x) =

1
8
f (x) = 

a + g[ a, a],

(53)

f],

t r[f
a  

where the commutators and trace have to be evaluated on the y algebra. the full
expression for the lagrangian lis in terms of the component elds in (52) as well
as the innitesimal gauge transformations which leave invariant lis are given in the
appendix.

it is worth noting that, since the y algebra contains also the anticommutators of
the su(n) generators, the couplings between the a gauge elds (4) and the corre-
sponding ones (along the ta basis) appear in the lagrangian (63-64) (see appendix).
in other words, the internal symmetry group u(1) is unied with that one of su(n)
by means of the graded cliord algebra. moreover in the gauge lagrangian the com-
plete symmetric structure functions dabc of the su(n) gauge group appears. the
presence of the dabc structure functions is one of the most interesting aspect of this
generalized model, which has no precedent (as far as we know) in any known gauge
theory.

the coupling of the gauge eld a with fermion elds in the adjoint representa-
tion can be obtained in a way similar to the one used in section [4] by taking into
account the dierent commutation rules of the y algebra. typically the generaliza-
tion so as to include the internal symmetries in the susy transformations (48) is also
straightforward.

6 matter fields in the fundamental representa-

tion

in this section we study the couplings of the gauge elds with the matter elds in the
fundamental representation of the gauge group by parallelizing the case of the adjoint

21

representation. since we are interested in studying a eld  which transforms as the
fundamental representations of the gauge group, we should rst dene its properties
under coordinate transformations this is necessary in order to build an action which
is invariant under the gauge and coordinate transformations. we begin by analysing
the fermionic sector.

a eld , which belongs to the fundamental representation of the gauge group,

under coordinate rotations has the following properties

x  x =  

 x,

i
k(x)  i

k (x) = skm()sij()j

m(x),

(54)

where s() and s() (which are dened in eq.(3) and in section [4], respectively) act
on the up and down indices, respectively. recall that [s(), s()] = 0. in euclidean
space the conjugate eld  eld is equal to .
(on the contrary in minkowski
space  = 00 should be used.) the eld  transforms under o(4) coordinate
transformations as (x) = (x)s()1 s()1. finally the most general kinetic
term lk (which is invariant under the transformations (54)) is given, in euclidean
space, by

lk = i

k()kmi

m + m i

ki
k,

where the last term is the mass term. note that by construction the operator 
acts only on the down spinorial indices k and m. we now require that the gauge
transformations u(x) commute with the  operator and so they act only on the
up dirac indices of . in particular under gauge transformation the eld  transforms
as

(55)

(56)

i
k  gi

k = u ij(x)j
k,

where u(x) is dened in eq.(9) and therefore the gauge connection aij
the up dirac index of the  eld.

 must act on

finally the lagrangian containing the eld  and which is invariant under the
extended gauge transformation is obtained by substituting  with the covariant
derivative d given by

dij

 = ij + g aij
 ,

(57)

where the a eld is dened in (4). note that the mass term in eq.(55) is invariant
under gauge transformations.

clearly since the  eld transforms as s  s under o(4) (see eq. (54)), it de-
scribes integer spins. in order to quantize the  eld we should derive the correct
statistics directly from the spin-statistics theorem [22]. this theorem establishes a

22

connection between the number of derivatives which are present in the kinetic term
of the free lagrangian and the statistical properties of the eld. this connection is
obtained by requiring that the hamiltonian density operator commutes at space-like
points and that it is bounded from below. in the case of ordinary elds we have that
dynamical elds which have at most second order derivatives and rst order deriva-
tives in the kinetic term are associated to the n (with n integer) and (2n + 1)/2 spin
elds respectively. therefore the standard quantization rules follows. in the present
case we have rst derivatives in the kinetic term of  eld. therefore, in agreement
with the spin-statistics theorem, we should quantize  as a fermionic eld. however
it is straightforward to check that a fermionic statistic for  is necessary in order to
have the hamiltonian bounded from below.

the free  propagator p (p) in momentum space is obtained in the usual way by
inverting the operator of the equation of motion and it is given, in euclidean space,
by

p ij
km = 

(p()km  m km)) ij

p2 + m2

.

(58)

analogously the bosonic sector of the matter elds, which are in the fundamental
representations of the gauge group, is described by elds of semi-integer spin. in par-
ticular we can introduce a eld k which transforms under coordinate transformations
as

k(x)  k(x) = skm()(x)m

and under gauge transformations as
k(x)  g

k (x) = u(x)km(x)m.

(59)

(60)

note that k(x) contains only one spinorial index and so, under coordinate trans-
formations, u(x) transforms as in eq.(8) with the same matrix s() appearing in
(59).

the o(4) and gauge invariant lagrangian for the k eld is given by

lk =

1
2

k( d d)kmm +

m2 kk,

1
2

(61)

where the adjoint eld k in euclidean space is k = k, the covariant derivative d
is dened in eq.(57) and m is the mass. even if the k eld transforms under o(4)
coordinate rotations as a semi-integer spin eld, similar arguments used for the i
k
allow us to conclude that k should satisfy a bosonic statistics.

it should by now be clear that it is not possible to couple directly these new
elds with the ordinary matter elds. obviously since the ordinary matter elds do

23

not carry dual spin indices and therefore they are singlet under the extended gauge
transformations. however it is possible to couple directly the matter elds in the
fundamental representation to the ordinary gauge elds. this is now shown with an
example. we assume that the  and  elds are charged under the electromagnetic
interactions. then we have to add in the covariant derivative d of eq.(57) the qed
gauge connection a as follows

dij

 = ij + g aij

 + eaij,

(62)

where a is the electromagnetic eld with e the corresponding gauge coupling. in
order to have a reasonable decoupling between these new particles and the ordinary
particles the  or  should have a mass scale much higher then ordinary matter
scales. as a result the decoupling between the massless gauge or gaugino sector of
the extended gauge theory is generated when the massive  or  elds are integrated
out. in particular eective couplings between the sectors of the ordinary gauge and
the extended gauge elds can be generated by means of higher dimensional operators
which are suppressed by the corresponding inverse powers of the mass scale of the
 or  elds. it follows that the eective interactions between the ordinary matter
elds (quarks and leptons) and the extended gauge elds can be generated by inte-
grating out the  and  elds. moreover these interactions should be suppressed by
higher powers of the ordinary gauge couplings. this mechanism to generate couplings
between the observable sector and the light one of the extended gauge symmetry has
some analogies with the gauge-mediated mechanisms proposed in soft susy breaking
models [23].

we stress that this is one of the possible mechanisms to couple in euclidean space
the ordinary matter and gauge sector to the extended one. in particular the role of
the electromagnetic gauge vector mediation described above could be played by any
other eld which is a singlet under the extended gauge transformations.

7 conclusions

in this article we analyzed the free particle spectrum of the extended ym gauge
theories in euclidean space. we found that the physical degree of freedoms contained
in the pure gauge sector of the su(4) group correspond to the spin contents of the
following massless elds: 3 spin-2, 8 spin-1 and 8 spin-0. some of the spin-1 and
spin-0 elds correspond to the longitudinal polarizations of the tensor elds which
cannot be gauged out. moreover we analyzed some quantum aspects by providing
the functional quantization in euclidean space for a general class of covariant gauges.

24

when majorana fermion elds in the adjoint representation of the gauge group
are added to the action, we found that the theory is also supersymmetric. moreover
the maximum semi-integer spin is 3/2 in four dimension and these rarita-schwinger
elds could be regarded as the supersymmetric partners of the spin-2 elds present
in the pure gauge theory.

the generalization so as to include the standard internal symmetries introduces a
larger unied group. in this model the corresponding algebra of this group is given
by the tensorial product of the cliord and the internal symmetry algebra. we give
the expression of the extended ym lagrangian generalized so as to include an su(n)
internal group. a remarkable aspect of this symmetry is that the u(1) generator of
the u(n) symmetry and the su(n) generators belong to the same algebra. moreover
we found that, in addition to the antisymmetric structure functions f abc of su(n),
also the complete symmetric ones dabc appear in the lagrangian (as a consequence of
the graded structure of the cliord algebra).

finally we analyzed the matter elds in the fundamental representation of the
extended gauge symmetry group. in this case we found a rather surprising result.
indeed, according to the spin-statistics theorem, the elds (in the fundamental rep-
resentation) with integer and semi-integer spin should be quantized with a fermionic
and bosonic statistics, respectively. this is a consequence of the fact that for elds
in the fundamental representation of this group the usual relation between the spin
and the order of the derivatives present in the kinetic term is changed: the integer
and semi-integer spin elds have one and two derivatives, respectively.

we conclude the present section by commenting on a possible future development
of this theory. it would be worth investigating the spontaneous symmetry breaking
of the pure gauge sector. indeed, due to the presence of the spin-2 elds, it would be
interesting to analyze if there is some connection between the spontaneously broken
phase of this model and the quantum gravity in euclidean space.

appendix

in this appendix we give the expression of the lagrangian lis in (53) in terms of
the components of the gauge potential (52) along the y algebra basis. by using the
commutation rules of the y algebra we obtain the following result for lis 13

, a
  a. (to avoid confusion we recall that  is the complete
antisymmetric tensor in euclidean space.) in the lagrangian (63) (and therefore in
the feynman rules) the contractions of the type dabcf cef , which cannot be reduced
as the product of combinations of ab, dabc, and f abc for a general su(n) group
[25], appear. (note that simplications can be obtained by choosing some particular
internal groups). clearly the physical amplitudes and correlation functions can be
expressed as products of ab. useful results and techniques are provided in refs.[26]
for the calculations of the traces of the ta matrix products.
