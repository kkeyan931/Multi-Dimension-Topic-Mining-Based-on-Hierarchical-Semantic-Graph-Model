i show that gravitational entropy can be ascribed to spacetimes containing misner strings (the
gravitational analogues of dirac strings), even in the absence of any other event horizon (or bolt)
structures. this result follows from an extension of proposals for evaluating the stress-energy of a
gravitational system which are motivated by the ads/cft correspondence.

the idea that one can associate entropy with certain gravitational eld congurations has a long history, dating
back to beckensteins suggestion [1] that the area of the event horizon of a black hole is proportional to its physical
entropy and to hawkings demonstration [2] that black holes can radiate with a black body spectrum at non-zero
temperature once quantum eects are taken into account. the relationship between the entropy of a black hole and
the area of its event horizon is quite robust, being applicable in any number of dimensions and extendable to black
branes and dilatonic variants [3].

hawking and hunter have recently suggested [4] that gravitational entropy arises whenever it is not possible to
foliate a given spacetime in the euclidean regime by a family of surfaces of constant time  . such breakdowns in
foliation can occur if the topology of the euclidean spacetime is not trivial  in particular when the u(1) isometry
group associated with the (euclidean) timelike killing vector  = / has a xed point set of even co-dimension. if
the xed point set has co-dimension d  2 then the usual relationship between entropy and area holds. however if
there exist additional xed point sets with lower co-dimensionality then the relationship between entropy and area is
generalized. this has been explictly demonstrated in taub-bolt and taub-bolt-anti de sitter (ads) spacetimes in 4
dimensions. both of these spacetimes have 2-dimensional xed point sets (i.e. event horizons, referred to as bolts
[5]) as well as 0-dimensional xed point sets (referred to as nuts) at which the orbits of the u(1) isometry group
become singular. in the latter case the singularities are of dimension 1 in the orbit space (and of dimension 2 in the
euclidean spacetime). they are the gravitational analog of dirac string singularities and are referred to as misner
strings. the presence of misner strings implies that one must include in the entropy budget not only the areas of
the bolts, but also those of the strings and the hamiltonians evaluated on the strings. these latter quantities are
divergent; by subtracting their analogous values in spacetimes with appropriately matched asymptotic structure with
no bolts present, nite values for the entropies for each spacetime may be obtained [4,6,7].

the purpose of this paper is to carry such arguments a step further by demonstrating that misner strings themselves
have an intrinsic entropy. one need not have a bolt present for a spacetime to have gravitational entropy. this result
follows from recent work on the conjectured ads/cft duality, which equates the bulk gravitational action of an
asymptotically ads spacetime with the quantum eective action of a conformal eld theory (cft) dened on the
ads boundary. inspired by this correspondence, balasubramanian and kraus [8] have proposed adding a term to
the boundary at innity (understood as boundary at some radius r in the large-r limit) which is a functional only of
curvature invariants of the induced metric on the boundary (see also ref. [9]). the addition of such terms does not
aect the bulk equations of motion because they are intrinsic invariants of the boundary metric. in four dimensions
only two invariants exist which (due to dimensionality) can contribute to the hamiltonian at innity, and their
coecients are uniquely xed by demanding that it be nite for schwarzchild-ads spacetime. as i shall demonstrate,
this choice of boundary term is sucient to compute nite values for the actions, hamiltonian, and entropies for
both taub-bolt-ads and taub-nut-ads spacetimes. a recent observation by lau [10] permits an extension of this
boundary term to asymptotically at cases, and i shall demonstrate how it may be used to compute entropies of the
taub-bolt and taub-nut spacetimes. taub-nut and taub-nut-ads are the rst examples of spacetimes without
bolts that have gravitational entropy.

the general relationship between entropy and area follows from the thermodynamic denition

combined with the path-integral derivation that the euclidean action i =  log z to lowest order, where z is the
partition function of an ensemble

log z = s  h

(1)

z = z [dg][d] exp[i(g, )]

with the path integral taken over all metrics g and matter elds  that are appropriately indentied under the period
 of  . the entropy is then the dierence between the value the action would have (h) if there were no breakdown
of foliation and its actual value. in order to compute this dierence, one can remove small neighbourhoods n i
 of
 in hamiltonian form, taking care to
the xed point sets and strings, so that i = im i
include the additional surface terms due to these new boundaries, one nds that the hamiltonian in the bulk and at
the xed point set boundaries vanishes; the only non-zero contributions are from the boundary at innity and from
the boundary along the strings, and so im i
 vanish, one nds [4,6]
in i
of the areas of the neighbourhoods removed, i.e. the bolts and the strings.

chosen so that the variational principle is well-dened. the euclidean manifold m has metric g, covariant derivative
, and time coordinate  which foliates m into non-singular hypersurfaces  with unit normal u.  is the trace
of the extrinsic curvature  of any boundary(ies) m of the manifold m , with induced metric(s) ; the manifold
can have internal boundary components as well as a boundary at innity, although only the latter will be needed in
what follows. here l() is the matter lagrangian and  the cosmological constant.
in general iv and ib are both divergent when evaluated on solutions, as are the string area and hamiltonian terms
in (2) above. the general method for treating this problem is to consider the values of these quantities relative to
some reference background spacetime whose boundary(ies) have the same induced metric(s) as those in the original
spacetime [1113]. this background is chosen so that its topological properties are compatible with the solution and
the solution approaches it suciently rapidly at innity. the reference spacetime is then interpreted as the vacuum
for that sector of the quantum theory. unfortunately this procedure suers from certain drawbacks. it is not always
possible to embed a boundary with a given induced metric into the reference background. furthermore the reference
spacetime is not necessarily unique, nor does it necessarily satisfy the invariance properties one might require of
certain thermodynamic quantities [14].

an attractive resolution to this diculty in ads spacetimes involves adding a term ict to the action which is a
functional only of boundary curvature invariants. as noted above, such a prescription is inspired by the conjectured
ads/cft correspondence: divergences which appear in the stress-energy tensor of the cft on the boundary are
just the standard ultraviolet divergences of quantum eld theory and may be removed by adding counterterms to
the action which depend only on the intrinsic geometry of the boundary, obviating the need to include any reference
spacetime at all. quantities such as energy, entropy, etc. can then be understood as intrinsically dened for a given
spacetime, as opposed to being dened relative to some abstract (and non-unique) background, although this latter
option is still available. in four dimensions [8]

(5)

where 2 = 3/|| and a and b are dimensionless coecients chosen so that the total action i = iv + ib + ict(ads) is
nite. although other counterterms (of higher mass dimension) may be added to ict, they will make no contribution
to the evaluation of the action or hamiltonian due to the rate at which they decrease toward spatial innity. although
the prescription (5) applies only to spacetimes which are asymptotically ads, it may be generalized to

ict =

which is equivalent to (5) for small  (as well as xed  and large mean boundary radius), and which (formally) has
a well-dened limit for vanishing cosmological constant (  ). in this limit (6) reduces to a prescription given by
lau [10].

empowered with the preceding prescription, the entropy of a given spacetime is then

where all quantities are evaluated on a given solution. by taking the variation of the action with respect to the
boundary metric  at innity, it is straightforward to show that

below. the measure d2
of genus g), the parameter b = 1, 0,1 for g = 0, 1, 2 respectively, the b = 1 case being the sads metric (10).
table i summarizes the results, with those for the  = 0 spacetimes being obtained by taking   . the metric
function v (r) characterizes the spacetime under consideration, and the time parameter is periodic, with periodicities
as listed. provided the counterterm in (6) is included as stated above, all results in table i are nite. the nut
solutions in table i have no bolts  their entropy is entirely due to the presence of the misner string (see ref. [18] for
an early discussion of the action of taub-nut space).

in the taub-nut solution the metric has a nut at r = n , with a misner string running along the z-axis from the
nut out to innity, and the solution is regular if r  n . in the taub-bolt case the metric is regular provided r  2n ,
with the bolt located at r = 2n ; there is also a misner string running along the z-axis. the dierence between
the actions, hamiltonians and entropies for these spacetimes yield the results obtained by hawking and hunter [4],
illustrating that the subtraction procedure they employ yields relative values for these quantities. the nut charge
is proportional to the the rst chern number of the u(1) bundle over the sphere at innity (in the orbit space of the
u(1) isometry group): the boundary at innity is a squashed s3.

similarly, in the taub-nut-ads spacetime, e parametrizes the squashing of the 3-sphere at innity. in the taub-
bolt-ads case the squashed s3 has k points identied around the u(1) direction; the parameter s is arbitary, and
r  s, with the location of the bolt at r = s, and s > 2/k. for completeness, the results for taub-nut-ads spacetime
with k points identied on the s1 bre of the squashed s3 is also given. as with the previous two cases, it is straight-
forward to show that the dierences between the actions, hamiltonians, and entropies for the taub-bolt-ads and
identied taub-nut-ads spacetimes yields the results of ref. [6].

one of the more unusual results apparent from table i is that in the ads cases the entropy is not positive for
all values of the parameters e and s. for the taub-nut-ads case the entropy is positive provided e < 2/3. the
hamiltonian is positive for e < 1, so there exists a range of solutions (with 2/3 < e < 1) for which the hamiltonian
is positive but the entropy is negative. for the taub-bolt case, the entropy is positive over the allowed range of s

for k = 1, 2, and is positive for all k provided s > p2 + 5  2.058. however for 1 < s < p2 + 5 the entropy is
negative, with lims1 s =  for k  3. the hamiltonian is positive for k = 1, 2 over the allowed range of s and for
s > p3 + 23  2.542 for all k, but is otherwise negative, and diverges to  as s  1. however only for k = 3 is
there a range of solutions (with 1.595 < s < 1.660 for with positive hamiltonian and negative entropy; for all other
values of k the entropy is positive provided the hamiltonian is. the relative entropy between a bolt spacetime and
its periodically matched/identied nut analogue is always positive.

the interpretation of these results needs some care. for spacetimes with zero nut charge, analytic continuation to
the lorentzian regime is straightforward because the boundary at innity is the direct product s1  s2. however for
non-zero nut charge this boundary becomes a squashed s3, and continuation to the lorentzian regime is problematic.
one possibility is to interpret the path integral over all metrics as the partition function for an ensemble of spacetimes
with xed nut charge. the prescription (6) removes the need to make relative comparisons of thermodynamic
quantities between spacetimes with similar asymptotic properties [4,6,7]. however the appearance of negative values
of the hamiltonian and entropy for certain (rather narrow) parameter ranges in the ads cases is puzzling, and may
correspond to some thermodynamic instability.

several interesting issues remain. while it is striking that the single choice a = b = 1 in (6) is sucient to yield
nite values for all of the quantities computed in table i, the overall consistency and utility of this prescription (e.g.
for non-spherical boundaries) remain open questions. from the cft perspective it is a non-analytic function of the
boundary curvature in the    limit, and an innite series in the boundary curvature for  6= 0. more generally, the
relationship the results in table i and the partition function and entropy of a conformal eld theory on the boundary
remain intriguing issues to explore.
