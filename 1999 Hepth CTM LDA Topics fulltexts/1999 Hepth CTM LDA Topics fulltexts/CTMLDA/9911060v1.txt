abstract

we calculate, in the context of higher dimensional gravity, the
stress-energy tensor and weyl anomaly associated with anti-de sitter
and anti-de sitter black hole solutions. the boundary counter-term
method is used to regularize the action and the resulting stress-energy
tensor yields both the correct black hole energies as well as a vacuum
energy contribution which is interpreted as a casimir energy. this
calculation is done up to d = 8 (d being the boundary dimension).
we conrm some results for d < 8 as well as comment on some new
results. all results for d = 8 are new.

1 introduction

there has been much debate in general relativity as to how to assign
the stress-energy contribution due to the gravitational eld. early works in

this eld include einsteins introduction of the pseudo- tensor [1] however,
this lacks invariance which should be present in a covariant theory such as
relativity. levi-civitas argument [2] that the stress-energy tensor, as dened
by the einstein tensor, plays the role of balancing out space-times stress
energy is a more natural interpretation. more recent work on the subject
may be found in [3].

the motivation for the counterterm subtraction method as found in
[4], [5] and [6] is not so much to dene a stress-energy tensor for gravity but
to regularize the gravitational action for spacetimes with constant energy
densities due to a cosmological term:

s =

s(ct)().

1 here, d is the dimension of the boundary (b), of the d-dimensional bulk
spacetime (b).  is the determinant of the boundary metric, ab and k is
the trace of the extrinsic curvature, kab of the boundary. the rst term
is the usual einstein hilbert term, the second the gibbons-hawking surface
term and the third is the counterterm action which removes the stress-energy
tensor divergences which result from the previous terms.

varying the rst two terms with respect to the boundary metric

yields the unrenormalized stress-energy tensor [8]:

t ab
(unren) =

1

8 (cid:0)k ab  kab(cid:1) .

(2)

the nal term in (1) may be constructed in two ways. there is the
background subtraction method of brown and york [8] where one chooses
for s(ct) the action of a spacetime with the same intrinsic geometry as the
spacetime of interest. for black holes of mass m for example, a natural
choice would be the m = 0 limit of the original spacetime (for example see
[9]). another method, which we will use here, involves constructing s(ct)
from curvature invariants of ab [4] and therefore bulk equations of motion
will not be aected. this method allows denitions of conserved quantities
without the introduction of a spacetime which is external to the one under
study. also, this method is useful when considering spacetimes which do not

spacetime.

have a natural reference background to which a comparison may be made or
when non-trivial topologies are present.

1.1 the boundary counterterm method.

in this section we will briey review the method of sucessive boundary
counterterms which was rst introduced in [4] and [6]. schematically, the
counterterms may be written as an expansion in inverse powers of :

the resulting total stress-energy tensor is then just

s(ct) = (cid:0)s(0) + 2s(1) + ...(cid:1) .

t ab
(f inite) = t ab

(unren) + t ab
(ct),

(3)

(4)

where t ab
metric ab.

(ct) comes from the variation of s(ct) with respect to the boundary

the appropriate counterterms are uniquely determined by demanding
that the resulting stress-energy tensor be nite. this nite tensor must then
reproduce the correct conserved quantities for known solutions.

if we write the line element of the boundary in adm form where the

hypersurfaces () are spacelike surfaces of constant t:

ds2

b = n 2

dt2 + ab(dxa + n a

dt)(dxb + n b

dt),

then the energy of the spacetime is obtained from the energy density as

m =z

dpxp|gtt|uaubtab(f inite).

where ua is the unit normal to .

(5)

(6)

although we will be primarily interested in energies, other conserved
quantities may be similarly calculated by exploiting other killing symmetries.
the integral in (6) will diverge due to the asymptotic behaviour of the metric
determinant unless tab(f inite) tends to zero for large r in such a way as to
remove divergences. it is this requirement for the conserved quantities to be
nite which uniquely determines the form of the counterterms.

this, albeit rather large, expression will allow us to compute the conserved
charges of the spacetime 2. we choose to study the higher dimensional

in the limit of vanishing black hole mass, r0 = 0, we have a pure vacuum state
which has non-zero energy. it was noted in [4] and [10] that, in light of the
ads/cft correspondence [11], the second term in m5 may be interpreted
as the casimir energy of the dual eld theory which is d = 4, n = 4, susy
yang mills theory.
it is interesting to note that in seven dimensions the
dual eld theory has negative energy whereas the other cases yield positive
energy. the dual eld theory to ads7  s4 supergravity is the large n limit
of the d = 6 (2, 0) tensor multiplet theory [11] of which little is known. the
eld spectrum of this theory includes ve scalars, a majorana-weyl spinor
and a 2-form potential, b, with self-dual three form eld strength, db and
is the intrinsic theory on n parallel m5 branes in the zero coupling limit.
the calculation here seems to imply that the casimir energy of such a theory
on s5  r is negative. we convert the above expression to gauge theoretic
quantities via

1 = 2lp(n)1/3,

(12)

6

with lp being the planck length. this yields a casimir mass of

ecasimir(2,0) =

10/3l 4

p n 4/3.

(13)

examples of negative energy solutions in general relativity are known
such as the analytically continued reissner-nordstrom solution (continued to
both imaginary time and charge) although it is debatable how physical this
construction is. also, it has been noted that if one considers the euclidean
time extension of d = d + 1 dimensional schwarzschild-anti-desitter black
holes, the energy corresponding to the dual gauge theory on sd1  s1 is
given by [9]:

e = 

d1rd1

0 

16

,

(14)

where  is the period of s1 required to make the solution smooth at the (eu-
clidean) horizon. the negative sign arises from the supersymmetry breaking
boundary conditions imposed along s1. since no such condition is imposed
in the d = 7 case where the boundary topology is s5  r it is curious that
a negative energy is produced.

2.1 anomaly calculation

recent interesting work regarding lower dimensional anomalies may be
found in [13] and [14] as well as [15] where dieomorphism techniques are
utilized. taking the trace of the full stress-energy tensor yields:

(16)

(the einstein equations dictate that no even power appears in the expan-
sion), the lowest order term in the expression (15) is then identied with the
anomaly. this has been shown to correspond with the work of henningson
and skenderis [16] for d  6. the d = 8 case is very labour intensive and
will be addressed in a later revision. instead, we utilize a dierent method to
calculate the anomaly which will also act as a check for future calculations.
for the following, we adopt the coordinate system of [16]. this

amounts to making the transformation:

r  1/1/2
gab = ab.

(17)

using (17) the eective, renormalized action may be obtained from the fol-
lowing density

l = dz

dd/21g + d/2 (2dg + 4g)|=,

(18)

where  > 0 is the cuto point for the  integration.

for even d a logarithmic term appears from the integral which arises
from the bulk part of the gravitational action, i.e. the usual einstein - hilbert
term with cosmological constant.

l = g(0)(cid:2)a(0)d/2 + a(2)d/2+1 + . . . + a(d2)1  a(d) ln()(cid:3) + nite terms.

(19)

it is the coecient of this logarithmic term (a(d)) which is to be identied
with the anomaly. by expanding g to order 4 we may obtain the anomaly
up to and including d = 8.

the einstein equations are given by [16]

(2g  2gg1g + tr[g1g]g) +

where primes denote ordinary dierentiation with respect to  and tr is the

3 conclusion

we considered here a counterterm subtraction technique to study stress-
energy tensors in higher dimensional gravity. we nd that the counterterm
method consistently produces correct black hole masses for d  8 and there-
fore this is a most useful technique even when there is no reference back-
ground with which to renormalize the energy. the calculations also produce
non-zero vacuum energies in the r0 = 0 limit. these are interpreted as
casimir energies of the boundary eld theory [4] which includes a negative
energy contribution. we also nd, by identifying logarithmic divergences in
the gravitational action, the weyl anomaly in the d = 8 case.
it will be
interesting to see if the counterterm technique produces a similar expression
for the anomaly.
