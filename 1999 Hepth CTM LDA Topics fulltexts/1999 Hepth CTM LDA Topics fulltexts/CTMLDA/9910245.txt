(examples given {$9711200$}.) results could possibly extended theorems possible xs (showing example suitable hypotheses ideal boundary x connected), simplicity consider case x = , analyze possible s. topological conditions presented correspondence, one wonders one characterize exist given n . general topological conditions ? choices n , one nd s? paper, prove following general 1 restriction: n positive scalar curvature (and nonempty), hn(m ; z) = 0. explain physical interpretation restriction. role positive scalar curvature suggested canonical example complete, negatively curved einstein manifold, namely hyperbolic space hn+1, known supergravity literature anti de sitter space adsn+1. case, conformal boundary n sphere sn, standard conformal structure representative standard round metric. metric certainly positive scalar curvature. basic role played example, correspondence quantum gravity n + 1 dimensions conformal eld theory n dimensions sometimes called ads/cft correspondence. general, conformal eld theory make sense manifold negative scalar cur- vature, specic conformal eld theories arise ads/cft correspondence, least examples studied far, well-behaved scalar curvature n non-negative. important case n four-manifold, seen di- rectly: case, conformal eld theories four-dimensional gauge theories contain scalar elds whose potential unstable scalar curvature n negative. generally, one sees considering action suitable brane {$9804085$} n negative scalar curvature, theory unstable. argument, whose details recall section 2, made considering brane whose worldvolume codimen- sion one hypersurface . one considers brane action l() (which dene section 2) shows unbounded n negative scalar curvature. n positive scalar curvature, theory stable, n zero scalar curvature, may stable unstable depending details. two puzzles concerning ads/cft correspondence therefore limit case n positive scalar curvature. consider following two puzzles concerning ads/cft correspondence: (1) happen n connected union disjoint components ni, = 1, . . . , s, positive scalar curvature? so, ads/cft correspondence make much sense. conformal eld theory union disjoint manifolds n = ini product theories dierent nis. evident way couple them, hence candidate interpret contribution whose boundary ini. 2 (2) given n positive scalar curvature, contain wormholes? wormhole obtained cutting two balls manifold m0 gluing together boundaries make new manifold . wormholes, understand conformal eld theory n , come grips strange behavior quantum gravity presence wormholes . resolve problems showing simply arise n positive scalar curvature. follows result n , hn(m ; z) = 0. indeed, (1), number boundary components greater one, hypersurface near one boundary components (dened equation = , coordinate used (1.1) = 0 denes boundary question) nonzero element hn(m ; z). hence vanishing hn(m ; z) implies n connected. likewise, (2), spacetime wormholes would nonzero hn(m ; z), since boundary either balls removed m0 nonzero element hn(m ; z). hence vanishing hn(m ; z) implies wormholes. results type denitely depend n positive scalar curvature. example, let q compact negatively curved einstein manifold dimension n, metric gijdxidxj. complete einstein metric negative curvature = q r given simple formula ds2 = dt2 + cosh2 gijdxidxj. (1.2) conformal boundary consists two copies q, = . shows conformal boundary negative scalar curvature, hn(m ; z) nonzero. note example, component n negative scalar curvature. fact, proof shows hn(m ; z) = 0 component n positive scalar curvature. interesting corollary fact that, stated hypotheses, n must connected natural map 1(n ) 1(m ) surjective. (for example, must simply connected n simply connected.) otherwise, taking suitable cover , one could make example disconnected n positive scalar curvature. structure argument proof hn(m ; z) = 0 boundary positive scalar curvature made showing, local calculation, brane action l() cannot minimum, also showing, using nonlinear analysis, minimum nonzero homology class boundary component positive scalar curvature. combining results, follows hn(m ; z) = 0 boundary component. local computation presented section 2 global one section 3. 3 2. local calculation let n + 1-dimensional einstein manifold negative curvature nonempty conformal boundary, n 2. let compact hypersurface . denote area volume a. since nonempty boundary, volume form exact, say = n-form . brane action (for bps brane) dened l() = nz . note boundary domain , l() = nv v =z (2.1) (2.2) (2.3) (2.4) (2.5) (2.6) volume enclosed . unique, changing add l term constant homology class, aect variational problem consider below.
