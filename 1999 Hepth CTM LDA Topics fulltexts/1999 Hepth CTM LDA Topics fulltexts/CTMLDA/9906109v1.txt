in the orbifold limit of k3, one can give exact conformal eld theory description of
d-branes wrapped on certain non-supersymmetric cycles of k3. we study the eect of
switching on the non-geometric blow up modes corresponding to anti-symmetric ten-
sor gauge eld ux through the 2-cycles on these d-branes. working to rst order in
the blow up parameter, we determine the region of the moduli space in which these
d-branes are stable. across the boundary of this region, the d-brane wrapped on the
non-supersymmetric cycle decays to a pair of d-branes, each wrapped on a supersymmet-
ric cycle, via a second order phase transition.

introduction and summary

bps d-branes[1, 2] have proved to be extremely useful in studying various aspects of

string dualities, stringy black holes and other properties of string theory. the original
formulation of d-branes was given for at d-branes in at space-time. signicant progress

was made in [3] in the study of curved d-branes. in particular [3] showed how to nd
an exact boundary conformal eld theory description of d-branes wrapped on certain

2-cycles of k3 in the orbifold limit. the 2-cycles studied there correspond to the cycles
associated with the blow up of the orbifold xed points.2 although in the orbifold limit
these 2-cycles have zero size, d-branes wrapped on these 2-cycles have nite tension due to
the presence of the anti-symmetric two form ux through these cycles[4]. these cycles are
supersymmetric, so that d-branes wrapped on these cycles correspond to bps d-branes.

if we take two such branes, associated with two dierent 2-cycles (i.e. dierent xed
points p and q of the orbifold) then the combined system could be non-supersymmetric

although the individual branes are bps. it was shown in [5, 6] that in certain region
of the moduli space, there is a single non-bps d-brane conguration carrying the same

charge quantum numbers as this combined system, but with tension less than the sum
of the tension of the two individual d-branes. thus we can regard this single brane as

a (classical) bound state of the two bps branes[7, 8, 9]. it can also be interpreted as
a d-brane wrapped around a single 2-cycle of k3 which is homologically equivalent to
the sum of the two individual cycles associated with the xed points p and q. since

the wrapped d-brane is non-bps, the associated cycle is non-supersymmetric. refs.[5, 6]
gave an exact boundary conformal eld theory description of this non-bps brane.

in the orbifold limit the relevant modulus which controls the stability of the non-bps

brane is the radius er of the circle of the original torus passing through the orbifold xed

2throughout this paper we shall use the words xed points and orbifold planes interchangeably, both

refering to ve dimensional xed planes spanning the non-compact directions.

points p and q.3 when this radius is less than a critical radius erc, the brane wrapped

on the non-supersymmetric cycle has lower tension than the sum of the tensions of the

two supersymmetric branes. this is reected in the fact that in this region of moduli
space the non-bps brane has no tachyonic mode and hence is stable, whereas the system
containing the pair of bps branes has a tachyonic mode and hence is unstable. when the

radius is larger than the critical radius the situation is reversed. now the tension of the
non-bps brane is larger than the sum of the tension of the two bps branes. furthermore

the tachyonic mode disappears from the system containing pair of bps branes, and a
tachyonic mode appears on the non-bps brane. thus in this region of the moduli space
the stable system is clearly the conguration of two bps branes.4

at the critical radius erc both systems have a massless open string mode representing

the limit of the tachyonic mode from their respective region of instability. we shall refer
to this as the tachyonic mode although at the critical radius it is not tachyonic. one can
show that this represents an exactly marginal deformation which interpolates between the

system containing a pair of bps branes and the non-bps brane[8, 5, 10, 11, 12]. let us
denote by  the parameter labelling the marginal deformation, normalized so that  = 0

(mod 2) represents the pair of bps branes and  = 1 (mod 2) represents the non-bps
brane.  can be interpreted as the vacuum expectation value (vev) of the tachyonic mode

on the brane. away from the critical radius the tachyonic mode develops a potential.
this potential energy (density) v () is periodic under    + 2 due to a periodicity in
the underlying conformal eld theory[8], and has the following qualitative behaviour:

1. at the critical radius v () vanishes, since the tachyonic deformation is exactly

marginal.

2. for er > erc, v () has a minimum at  = 0 and a maximum at  = 1. this

shows that the  = 0 conguration, representing a pair of bps branes, is the stable

conguration, whereas the  = 1 conguration representing the non-bps brane is
unstable.

3for simplicity we are assuming that the torus used in the construction of the orbifold is a product
of four circles and the points p and q lie along one of the circles. we also take the radii of the other
circles to be suciently large in order to avoid other kinds of instability[5, 6] than the ones which will be
discussed here.

4throughout this paper we shall restrict our analysis to open string tree level. thus the process of
formation of the bound state via tachyon condensation discussed here is distinct from the bound state
formation via possible attractive force due to closed string exchange interaction. the former is an open
string tree level eect whereas the latter is open string one loop eect.

moduli which we shall turn on are not the geometric blow up modes, but deformations
corresponding to changing the ux of the anti-symmetric tensor eld through the 2-cycle.

although these particular moduli do not correspond to the geometric blow up parameters,
but deformations of the kahler class associated with the cycles by an imaginary part, we

shall refer to these as the blow up modes. we nd that to rst order in the blow up
parameters, the potential v () depends on only one of these parameters, which is the

dierence in the antisymmetric tensor eld ux through the two 2-cycles. we compute
the complete potential v () to rst order in the blow up parameter  and rst order in

the dierence (er  erc). the result is:

v ()  (

from this we can study the locations of the extrema of the potential for various ranges of

er. we can also identify the nature of the absolute minimum of v () in dierent ranges of
er by continuously connecting it to a minimum of v () for  = 0, where the identication
is known. as is clear from eq.(1.1), v () is invariant under    + 4, and   .
using this we can restrict  to the range 0    2. in this range the minimum of v ()

the phase transition from the non-bps d-brane to the pair of bps d-branes is second

supersymmetric cycles of k3, for convenience we shall focus on a particular case  d2-

brane of type iia string theory wrapped on the cycles of k3.

in section 2 we give a

description of these states using the (non-bps) d-branes of type ii string theory, and
give a precise statement of the problem that we want to solve. in section 3 we solve the

problem by nding the tachyon potential, and nding its extrema.

2 statement of the problem

in this section we review some of the earlier results which will be required for our analysis,
carry out some preliminary analysis of the problem, and give a precise statement of the
problem that we shall solve in the next section. the system that we shall analyse is the

same one as in [5], namely a non-bps d-string of iia wrapped on a circle es1 of radius
er, modded out by i4 where i4 reverses the direction tangential to es1 and three other

directions.6 this can be regarded as a two brane wrapped on a non-supersymmetric cycle
of k3 in the orbifold limit if the other three directions are compact[5, 6]. we shall take the

radii of these three directions to be suciently large so that there are no tachyonic modes
from open strings wound in these directions. in order to use some of the already known

6the d-string is taken to be at the origin of these other three coordinates, so that the original

conguration is invariant under i4.

results, we shall rst make a t-duality transformation on es1, so that the background now
represents type iib string theory on the dual s1 modded out by (1)fl i4, and the non-
bps d-string of the original type iia theory becomes a non-bps d-particle of iib[14, 15]
stuck to one of the orbifold planes. this system is identical to the one analysed in [7, 15],
and can also be identied to the system analysed in [8] before the orbifold projection.

we shall denote by r =  er1 the radius of the dual s1 and by x the coordinate of the

dual s1 and take the non-bps d-particle to be located at x = 0. we shall refer to this
new description of the system as the iib description, and the original description as the
iia description. from now on we shall continue to use the type iib description unless

mentioned otherwise.

although the non-bps d-particle in type iib string theory has a tachyonic mode, it

is projected out by the orbifolding operation[15, 8]. however, as we reduce the radius r
of s1, the open string stretched between the d-particle and its image across s1 develops
a tachyonic mode. let rc denote the critical radius below which this tachyonic mode
appears. in the  = 1 unit that we shall be using, rc = 12. the physical interpretation
of the appearance of the tachyonic mode can be understood by studying the mass of the
non-bps d-particle, as well as the total mass of a d-string d-string pair of type iib string
theory, wrapped on s1. if g denotes the type iib string coupling constant, then the mass
of the non-bps d-particle stuck to the orbifold plane is given by:

md0 =

2 

2 

1
g

=

1
2g

.

(2.1)

the various factors in this expression can be understood as follows. since taking orbifold
by i4  (1)fl cuts space into half its original size, it keeps only half of the d-particle at
x = 0. thus its mass is half of that of the non-bps d-particle in type iib string theory,
which in turn is equal to (2/g). by the same argument, after the orbifold projection the
mass of a d-string wrapped on s1 is computed by multiplying its tension by r instead
of 2r, since one fundamental region of the orbifold contains a piece of the d-string

stretched from the xed point at x = 0 to the xed point at x = r. the total mass of
the d-string d-string pair stretched from x = 0 to x = r is given by:

md1 d1 = 2.

(2.2)

we see that at r = rc = 12
the two systems are degenerate. below the critical radius
the d-string d-string pair has lower energy. thus it would be natural to associate the

9

tachyonic instability of the d0-brane to the possibility of its decay into a d-string d-string
pair, provided the two systems carry the same charge quantum numbers.

in order to investigate whether the d-particle carries the same charge quantum num-
bers as a d-string d-string pair, we use the boundary state[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] descrip-
tion of the two systems. the boundary state describing the d-particle was constructed in

[15]. it is a linear combination of untwisted sector neveu-schwarz-neveu-schwarz (nsns)
states and twisted sector ramond-ramond (rr) states, from which it follows that it is

charged under the gauge eld at x = 0 originating in the twisted rr sector. the situation
with a d-string ( d-string) is somewhat more complex. the boundary state describing a
bps d-string ( d-string) is characterized by a z2 wilson line ei = 1 along s1, and two
more parameters 1, 2 which can take values 1[7]:

|, 1, 2i =

22

2(|t1in sn s + 1|t1irr)

+

22

ei2(|t2in sn s + 1|t2irr) .

(2.3)

here u stands for untwisted sector, t1 stands for twisted sector at x = 0 and t2 stands
for twisted sector at x = r. 1 takes value +1 (1) for a d-string ( d-string), and 12
denotes the sign of the twisted sector rr charge carried by the x = 0 end of the d-string.
ei12 denotes the sign of the twisted sector rr charge carried by the x = r end of the
string.

thus we see that after modding out by (1)fl i4 a d-string ( d-string) carries twisted
sector ramond-ramond (rr) charge at its two ends. if we choose a d-string state that
carries + charge at the x = 0 end and  charge at the x = rc end corresponding to
(, 1, 2) = (, +, +) (conguration (a) in fig.6 of [7]), and a d-string that carries +
charge at both ends corresponding to (, 1, 2) = (0,,) (conguration (g) of fig.6 of
[7]), then the d-string d-string pair is neutral under the twisted sector gauge eld at x =
rc and carries +ve charge under the twisted sector gauge eld at x = 0. this matches
with the charge quantum number of the non-bps d-particle at x = 0, as can be seen from

the fact that the massless rr component of the boundary state describing a non-bps
d-particle at x = 0[15](published version) is given precisely by twice that appearing in
eq.(2.3).7 hence the d-particle can decay into this pair of d-string states. the appearance

7this relative factor of (1/2) between the twisted sector rr charge carried by the end of a bps
d-string and by a non-bps d-particle can be seen as follows. the open string partition function for

10

of the tachyonic mode on the d-particle below r = rc signals the possibility of this decay.
from this analysis we see that this conguration requires the d-string to carry a z2 wilson
line, whereas the d-string does not carry any wilson line. in the dual type iia description
the d-string d-string pair, with the d-string carrying a z2 wilson line, corresponds to a

d0- d0 pair situated at diametrically opposite points on the dual circle es1. after modding
out by i4 this can be reinterpreted as a pair of bps d2-branes of iia, wrapped on the
two cycles associated with the two orbifold xed points on es1[3].
note that we could also consider a d-string state that carries + charge at both ends
corresponding to (, 1, 2) = (0, +, +) (conguration (c) in fig.6 of [7]), and a d-string
that carries + charge at the x = 0 end and  charge at the x = rc end corresponding
to (, 1, 2) = (,,) (conguration (e) of fig.6 of [7]). this has the same rr charge
as the previous conguration, and so the d-particle can also decay into this state. this
diers from the previous conguration by having the wilson line on the d-string rather
than on the d-string. in the dual type iia description this again corresponds to a d0- d0

pair on es1, but with their positions reversed.

a more systematic analysis of the transition from the d-particle state to a d-string

d-string pair was carried out in refs.[8, 5].
it was shown that the lowest mode of the
tachyon, which is massless at r = rc, represents an exactly marginal deformation. by
switching on this marginal deformation one can continuously interpolate between the
boundary conformal eld theories (bcft) describing the non-bps d-particle and the
d-string d-string pair. we could see this marginal deformation either by starting from
the d-particle side, or by starting from the d-string  d-string side. we shall nd it
more convenient to do the analysis from the d-string d-string side, so that we can use
the results of [8].

on an innite d-string d-string system there is a tachyonic mode with mass2 =  1
2 .
upon wrapping the d-string d-string pair on a circle of radiusr, with a z2 wilson line on
the d-string, the tachyon eld t is anti-periodic under x  x + 2r, and has a fourier
the non-bps d-string has a projection operator 1+(1)f
, where f denotes world-sheet fermion
number, g1 denotes (1)fl accompanied by the transformation (x6. . . . x9  x)  (x6, . . .  x9), and
g2 denotes (1)fl accompanied by the transformation (x6. . . . x9)  (x6, . . .  x8, 2r  x9)[7]. on
the other hand, partition function of open strings living on a non-bps d-particle at x  x9 = 0 has a
projection operator 1+(1)f g1
[15]. thus the coecient of (1)f  g1 in the two cases dier by a factor
of 4. since this coecient is related to the norm of the twisted sector rr component of the boundary
state describing the system, we conclude that the twisted sector rr component of the boundary state
describing a d-particle has an extra factor of 2 compared to that describing a d-string.

the bosonic coordinate , and clearly represents a marginal deformation.

since at r = rc the tachyon becomes marginal, the tachyon potential v () vanishes
at r = rc. for r < rc, v () has a minimum at  = 0, representing the fact that the d-
string d-string conguration corresponds to the minimum energy conguration, whereas
for r > rc, v () has a minimum at  = 1 indicating that the non-bps d-particle
represents the minimum energy conguration. thus the point r = rc marks the phase
boundary between the stable d-particle conguration, and the stable d-string d-string
conguration. the question that we shall be interested in is: how does this picture get

modied when we go to a dierent point in the moduli space of k3 (in the original type iia
description)? we shall only analyse the eect of small deformations around the original

conguration. these may be divided into two classes: moduli of type iia string theory
on the torus (constant metric and antisymmetric tensor eld background), and the blow
up modes of the xed points corresponding to twisted sector closed string states from the

nsns sector. there are four such blow up modes from each orbifold xed point. three of
these modes correspond to geometric blow up parameters, and the fourth one corresponds

to antisymmetric tensor eld ux through the 2-cycle associated with the xed point. in
the dual type iib description that we have been using, we have the moduli corresponding

to constant metric and anti-symmetric tensor eld background in the dual torus, and
the twisted sector modes. in this case however the twisted sector modes from the nsns
sector have a dierent interpretation. each orbifold plane obtained by modding out by
i4  (1)fl has a hidden ns ve brane, since it is s-dual to the coincident orientifold
5-plane d-5-brane system[23]. switching on the twisted sector modes associated with

a given orbifold plane corresponds to moving the ns ve-brane away from the orbifold
plane.

it can be easily veried that switching on the constant metric or anti-symmetric tensor
eld background does not modify the physics at the phase boundary between a stable
conguration of d-particle and the d-string d-string system. to see this note that if we
denote by r the radius of s1 measured in the new metric, then in terms of r, the tachyon
mass formula (2.5) as well as the d-brane mass formulae (2.1), (2.2) remain unchanged.
thus at the critical radius r = 12 the d-particle becomes degenerate with the d-string

thus it remains to study what happens when we switch on the twisted sector massless

nsns elds. we shall now argue that only one of the eight blow up modes associated
with the two xed points actually aect the masses of the d-brane system to rst order

and hence could modify the physics at the phase boundary to this order. to do this we
use the boundary state description of the d-string d-string system given in [7] and that
of the non-bps d-particle given in [15]. first of all, the boundary state describing the
non-bps d-particle is a linear combination of the boundary state from untwisted sector

nsns sector, and twisted sector rr sector[15]. since it has no component from the
twisted sector nsns sector, we see that the d-particle does not have a direct coupling to
these states and hence its mass does not depend on these twisted sector moduli to rst
order. on the other hand, from eq.(2.3) we see that the d-string ( d-string) boundary
state has components along the twisted sector nsns states, and so the mass of the d-
string ( d-string) has linear dependence on the particular moduli elds which appear in
the boundary state. there are two such moduli, one from |t1in sn s and the other from
|t2in sn s. the physical interpretation is quite clear. these moduli represent the motion
of the ns ve branes along the circle s1, and since the ends of the d-string ( d-string) lie
on the ns ve-branes, their lengths and hence their masses depend on the location of the
ve-brane along s1.9 also note that for a given change in the location of the ve brane
the change in the mass can have either sign (as reected in the coecient of |t1in sn s
and |t2in sn s in (2.3), which can be of either sign). this can be traced to the fact that
the d-string ( d-string) can either end on the ns 5-brane or its image under i4  (1)fl.10
as we move the ve brane in one direction, its image moves in the opposite direction.
thus whether the mass increases or decreases for a given movement of the ve-brane is
determined by whether the d-string ( d-string) ends on the ve-brane or its image.

as has been discussed earlier, the d-string d-string system under consideration cor-
responds to the congurations (a) and (g) of ref.[7], characterized by (, 1, 2) values
(, +, +) and (0,,) respectively. using eq.(2.3) we see that the twisted sector compo-
9moving the ve-branes in directions transverse to s1 does not aect the length and hence the mass
of the d-string ( d-string) to rst order.

10the s-dual version of this was explained in fig.2 of [7].

nent of the boundary state of the combined system is given by:

2

(|t1irr  |t2in sn s) .

(2.9)

the component |t1irr indicates that it carries twisted sector rr charge associated with
the x = 0 plane, as must be the case since it has the same charge as the d-particle situated
at x = 0. on the other hand, the component |t2in sn s indicates that it couples to nsns
sector twisted sector modes associated with the orbifold plane at x = r. thus the mass
of the combined system depends only on the location of the ns ve-brane associated with

the orbifold plane at x = r. this can be explained by taking both the d-string and
the d-string to end on the ns 5-brane at x = r, but having one of them end on the
5-brane and the other end on its image near x = 0.11 in that case the motion of the ns
5-brane near x = 0 will not change the total mass of the system, but the motion of the

ns 5-brane near x = r will change the total mass.

let us denote by  the specic massless mode that appears in |t2in sn s. from eq.(2.9)
we see that this is the only nsns twisted sector mode on which the mass of the d-string
d-string pair depends to rst order, and we shall study how the transition between the d-
particle state and the d-string d-string state is aected upon switching on this mode. in
the original type iia description,  denotes the dierence in the ux of the antisymmetric
tensor eld through the two 2-cycles of k3, associated with the two orbifold xed points.
our strategy will be to determine the tachyon potential completely for r  rc,   0
to linear order in (r  rc) and , ignoring terms quadratic in (r  rc) and , as well
as terms of order (r  rc), and then study its minimum as a function of  for various
values of r and . thus the general form of the potential will be

v () 

1
g

[(r  rc)f () + g()] ,

(2.10)

where f () and g() are two functions to be determined. note that since we are working
close to the point r = rc,  = 0, we can continue to use the parameter  to label
the nearly massless tachyonic mode. also note that we have extracted an overall power

11this must be the case if both of them have to carry the same charge at the x = 0 end and opposite
charge at the x = r end, since the d-string and the d-string, ending on the same ve-brane, carry
opposite charge. on the other hand if the d-string and the d-string end on the ve brane and its image
respectively, then their ends carry the same charge, since the gauge eld on the ve-brane world-volume
that survives the orbifold projection is the dierence between the u(1) gauge eld on the ve brane and
its image. this is exactly analogous to the situation describing a d5-brane near an orientifold 5-plane.

15

of the inverse string coupling (g1) outside the potential since the g dependence of the
world-volume action of a d-brane always comes through such an overall multiplicative

factor.

in the next section we shall determine the functions f () and g(), and study the
extremum of the potential as a function of . by studying how the minimum of the

potential varies as we change the parameters r and , we shall be able to determine the
phase diagram of the d-brane system under study in the r   plane.

3 determination of the tachyon potential and the

phase diagram

first we shall determine f (). for this we set  = 0, so that the tachyon potential has
the form:

v () =

[(r  rc)f () + o((r  rc)2)] ,

(3.1)

1
g

for r  rc. we can determine f () by noting that (v /)  g1(r  rc)f()
corresponds to the one point function of the tachyon to order (rrc). this was computed
in [8] and the answer was found to be proportional to sin . integrating this we see that
f () must be proportional to cos(). the constant of proportionality can also be easily
found by noting that the dierence between v () at  = 0 and at  = 1 must be equal
to the dierence between the total mass of the d-string d-string pair wrapped on s1, and
the mass of the non-bps d-particle. using eqs.(2.1), (2.2) we get

this gives12

v ( = 0)  v ( = 1) =

1
g

(r  rc) .

f () =

1
2

cos() .

(3.2)

(3.3)

from eqs.(3.1) and (3.3) we see that the minimum of v is at  = 0 for r < rc, and is at
 = 1 for r > rc. this is consistent with the fact that the d-string d-string pair is the
stable conguration for r < rc, and the d-particle is the stable conguration for r > rc.
we shall now use a shortcut for determining f (), which we shall generalise later for

determining g().

in the derivation given above, we have used the tachyon one point

12this analysis determines v () up to an additive -independent constant which has no relevance for

nding the extrema of v () in the -space.

function to rst order in (r rc) to compute f(). this represents a two point function
on the disk in the theory at r = rc, with one insertion of the closed string vertex operator
vb corresponding to radius deformation at the center, and one insertion of the tachyon
vertex operator at the boundary[8]. we need to choose the picture numbers[22] of these
vertex operators so that the total picture number is 2. let us take vb to be in (1,1)
picture, and the tachyon vertex operator in the 0-picture. besides this there is an insertion
of the exponential of the integrated zero picture tachyon vertex operator at the boundary

as given in eq.(2.6). since the  dependence of the one point function comes from only
the matter part of the correlation function, let us restrict ourselves to this sector. in this

case it is clear that if we start from an amplitude where we only have the insertion of
vb at the center, and the exponential of the integrated tachyon vertex operator at the
boundary, then by dierentiating it with respect to  we bring down an extra factor of
tachyon vertex operator at the boundary. since this two point function has been argued
to be proportional to f(), we see that the original amplitude is proportional to f ()
itself.

the main lesson from here is that f () may be computed directly by computing the
matter part of the disk amplitude with a single insertion of vb at the center (reecting
that we are working to order (r  rc)) and insertion of the exponential of integrated
tachyon vertex operator at the boundary given in eq.(2.6). the computation of g()
will be done in the same way, with vb replaced by the appropriate twisted sector vertex
operator vt w .13

let us now turn to the determination of g(). since we have already argued that
the energy of the d-string d-string system depends linearly on , we see that g(0) must
be a non-zero constant. we shall absorb this constant into the denition of  and set
g(0) = 1.14 on the other hand by analysing the boundary state describing the non-bps
d-particle we have argued before that the mass of this d-particle does not depend on .
hence g(1) must vanish.

the complete determination of g() is done by computing the disk amplitude with
an insertion of the  vertex operator at the center, and the exponential of the integrated

13if one could construct the boundary state describing the system at r = rc for all  analogously to

ref.[10], then one could read out g() by computing the component of the boundary state along vt w .

14with this normalization the  dependent contribution to the mass of the d-string d-string pair is
given by (/g). this should be equated to the total tension (1/g) of the d-string d-string pair multiplied
by the shift in the position of the ns 5-brane. thus  measures the shift in the position of the ns
5-brane.

tachyon vertex operator at the boundary. we use the notation and the normalization
conventions of [8]. the vertex operator vt w for a twisted sector state associated with the
orbifold plane at x = rc has the property that as we go around such a vertex operator on
the fundamental string world-sheet, the various world-sheet elds undergo the following
changes:

using eqs.(2.7), (2.8) we see that this transformation is equivalent to,

x  (2rc  x),

e  e .

  ,

e  e,

e  e,

  ,

(3.4)

(3.5)

e  e ,

l  l +

(3.6)
thus as we go around vt w on the string world-sheet,  = l + r changes by 2. since
r dttb measures the total change of  as we go around the boundary of the disk, we see

that if there is an insertion of vt w at the center of the disk, then

(3.7)

this shows that g() is proportional to cos( 1

2 ). using the normalization g(0) = 1, we

g() = cos(

) .

(3.8)

this satises the condition g(1) = 0 derived earlier. thus the full tachyon potential to
this order is given by:

v ()

(

(r  rc) cos() +  cos(

(3.9)

note that the potential is periodic in  with periodicity 4. this may appear as a
surprise, as in ref.[8] it was found that the bcft describing the d-string d-string system is
periodic in  with periodicity 2. we can understand the origin of this apparent discrepancy
as follows. let us set  = 0, r = rc, and start from the d-particle state represented
by the point  = 1. we can perturb this system by the marginal tachyonic deformation
and study the fate of the bcft as a function of the new deformation parameter (  1).
the t-dual version of this analysis in the type iia description was carried out in [5].

in this analysis the starting conguration was a non-bps d-string of iia wrapped on a

18

circle. switching on the marginal deformation corresponding to (  1) = 1 corresponds
to the creation of a kink-antikink pair on the circle, which is to be interpreted as a d0-
brane d0-brane pair of type iia string theory situated at diametrically opposite points
on a circle[5, 24].15 on the other hand if we take (  1) = 1, the eect is to create
an antikink-kink pair. thus the result is again a d0- d0 pair, but with their positions
reversed. this has the following interpretation in the dual type iib description. if we take
the  = 0 conguration to represent a d-string d-string pair with a wilson line on the
d-string, then the  = 2 conguration denotes a d-string d-string pair with a wilson line
along the d-string. these correspond to the same bcft before the orbifold projection,
but dier in the orbifold theory when twisted sector modes are switched on. as discussed
in section 2, since the wilson line is on the d string, the  = 2 conguration corresponds to
the pair of states carrying (, 1, 2) quantum numbers (0, +, +) and (,,) respectively
(pair of states (c) and (e) in the language of [7]). using eq.(2.3) we see that the twisted
sector component of the boundary state describing the combined system is given by:

1
2

(|t1irr + |t2in sn s) .

(3.10)

comparing with eq.(2.9) we see that it carries the same twisted sector rr charge as the

system at  = 0, but its coupling to the twisted sector nsns state is opposite to that of
the system at  = 0. thus the  dependent component of the tachyon potential should

have opposite signs at  = 0 and at  = 2, as is the case for the potential given in eq.(3.9).
using the periodicity    + 4 we can restrict  to the range 2 <   2. also,
by making a gauge transformation on the d-string d-string system at  = 0, we can
change the sign of the tachyon, which corresponds to the transformation   . thus
 and  denote equivalent congurations, and the physical range of  can be taken to
be 0    2. finally, without any loss of generality we can take  to be negative in our
analysis, since the sign of  can be changed by a redenition   2  .

let us dene:

by analysing the potential (3.9) with  < 0, we get the following results:

u = 2(r  rc) .

(3.11)

1. for u < (||), v () has a pair of minima at  = 0 and at  = 2, and a maximum
at  = (2/) cos1(/u). the absolute minimum is at  = 0. as   0, this

d-string.

19

state goes over smoothly to the d-string d-string system with the wilson line on
the d-string. thus even for non-zero  we can identify the system at  = 0 to a
d-string d-string pair.

2. for (||) < u < (||), v () has a minimum at  = 0 and a maximum at  = 2.
as u passes through the point u = ||, the minimum at  = 0 evolves smoothly.
thus even in this range of u, we can interprete the stable minimum at  = 0 as a
d-string d-string pair.

3. for u > (||), v () has a pair of maxima at  = 0 and at  = 2, and a minimum
at  = (2/) cos1(/u). as   0, this minimum evolves smoothly to the stable
non-bps d-particle corresponding to the point  = 1. thus by continuity we can
conclude that for u > || the stable minimum at  = (2/) cos1(/u) denotes
the stable non-bps d-particle.

if we want to translate these results to the dual iia description, we only need to note

1
r2
c
reproduces the results quoted in the introduction.

the results for  > 0 can be obtained by using the symmetry   ,   2  . in
this case the  = 2 conguration, representing a d-string d-string pair with wilson line
on the d string, corresponds to the stable minimum for u < ||, and the  = 2
 cos1( 
u )
conguration, representing a non-bps d-particle at x = 0, corresponds to the stable
minimum for u > ||.
that the radius er of the circle in this description is given by (1/r). thus (er  erc) 
(rc  r) = 2(rc  r). thus the parameter u can be identied as (erc  er). this
the phase diagram in the u  plane is quite simple. for  < 0, u < (||) the d-string
d-string with wilson line on the d-string is the stable conguration. in the dual theory
describing type iia on k3, this corresponds to a pair of d2-branes, each wrapped on
a supersymmetric cycle of k3. for  > 0, u < ||, the d-string d-string system with
wilson line on the d-string is the stable conguration. in the dual iia theory this again
corresponds to a pair of wrapped d2-branes, but carrying opposite d0-brane charges
compared to the previous conguration. for u > (||) the non-bps d-particle is the
in the dual type iia theory this represents a d2-brane
stable conguration for all .
wrapped on the non-supersymmetric cycle. the phase diagram in the (er = erc  u, )

plane has been shown in fig.4.

the location of the minimum min of v () evolves continuously as u crosses the phase
boundary ||. it is instructive to study the nature of the transition across the line u = ||.
for this note that for  < 0, u > || the potential has two maxima and a minimum in the
range 0    2. as u approaches || from above, the maximum at  = 0, the minimum
at  = (2/) cos1(/u), and its image under    merge together to become a
single minimum at  = 0. thus we can conclude that the phase transition across the
 < 0, u = || line is second order. as is the characteristic of such a phase transition, at
u = || the rst three  derivatives of v () vanish at  = 0. the same result holds for
the line  > 0, u = ||. on the other hand, phase transition across the line  = 0, u < 0
is rst order, as the location of the minimum of v () jumps discontinuously from  = 0
to  = 2 across this line.

note that for u > || the value of the potential at the minimum min is given by:

v (min) = 

1
g

[

2

(r  rc) +

 2

4(r  rc)

] .

(3.12)

from this one can calculate the mass of the non-bps d-particle as follows. first of all

we note that the total mass of the system for a given value of  must be related to v ()
by an additive constant:

m() = c + v () .

(3.13)

c is determined by demanding the m( = 0) reproduces correctly the mass of the d-
string d-string pair. since using footnote 14 we see that  corresponds to the shift of
the ns 5-brane near x = r, the net distance of this ns 5-brane from the x = 0 plane is
(r + ). thus the mass of the d-string d-string system, obtained by multiplying their
length by the tension, is given by (r + )/g. this gives:

c =

1
g

(r + )  v ( = 0) =

1
2g

(r + rc) .

thus the mass of the stable non-bps d-particle for r > rc + 1

2|| is given by:

m(min) = c + v (min) =

1
g

(rc

4(r  rc)

) .
