abstract

using the known propagator equations for 0,1 and 2 forms in adsd+1, we
nd the p-form eld propagator equations in dimensions where the forms are
poincare dual. since the general equation obeyed by the propagators is linear
in dimension, this gives us the equation obeyed by the propagators for any
d. furthermore, based on the poincare duality formulas for 0,1,2 and 3 forms
we conjecture the general form of the poincare duality formulas, and check
them against the previously found propagator equations. the whole structure
is self-consistent. once we have the equations, we can easily obtain all the
p-form eld propagators in adsd+1.

i. introduction

in [14] the propagators for scalars, vectors and antisymmetric 2-tensors in adsd+1 were
computed. furthermore, in [4] poincare duality between the vector and 2-tensor propagator
was veried for d = 4. in a maximally symmetric space like adsd+1 the general propagator
for a p-form eld is a maximally symmetric bitensor. as explained in [5], this bitensor is
a product of antisymmetrized partial derivatives of the chordal distance u multiplied by a
scalar function gp(u). the form of the equations obeyed by gp is very similar for the cases
we know (p=0,1, and 2). by using poincare duality between the 3-form eld and the 0,1
and 2 - form elds for d=4,5 and 6 we can nd the form of the equations obeyed by g3
in these dimensions. since the equations are obtained from the equations of motion, and
by contracting at most 2 derivatives acting on chordal distances, they must depend on the
dimension of the space in a linear way. thus, it becomes very easy to see the general form
of the equation of motion obeyed by g3. the same method can be easily generalized for all
the p-form propagators.

ii. the 2-form propagator - brief review

in this section we will be giving an outline of the method used in [4].

in euclidean

adsd+1, with the metric

ds2 =

1
z2
0

(dz2

0 + d

i=1dz2

i ),

(1)

the easiest way to express invariant functions and tensors is in terms of the chordal distance:

u 

(z0  w0)2 + (zi  wi)2

2z0w0

.

(2)

we work in the subspace of conserved currents, so gauge xing is not necessary.

the 2-form propagator, g; 

is a bitensor, and as explained in [5,1,4], it can be

expressed as a combination of 2 bitensors:

t 1
;  = u u   uu

t 2
;  = uu u   uuu  uu u +  uuu

nevertheless, it is more advantageous to decompose it as

g;  = t 1

; g2(u) + dv;   dv; ,

(3)

(4)

where the second part is a gauge artifact. upon using the equations of motion, which involve
2 covariant derivatives applied on a combinations of g; s, we nd the equation of motion
obeyed by g2 by equating the scalar coecients multiplying t 1 and t 2. in doing this we
use the formulas in the appendix. the contractions of two covariant derivatives which these
formulas allow us to do, give us extra factors multiplying g and its derivatives. nevertheless,
there is only one contraction per term, and thus these extra factors in the equation for g2
can only be linear in d. we obtain an equation of a hypergeometric form, whose solution
can be easily found.

2

iii. the tensor structures of the p-form propagators

similarly to the 2-form, the 3 form propagator g;  is antisymmetric in both primed
and unprimed indices, and can be expressed as a sum of 2 bitensors similar to t 1 and t 2
multiplied by functions of u. nevertheless, it is more convenient to combine the 2 bitensors
into a gauge invariant part and a gauge artifact:

g;  = (1)3[u uu +   antipermutations]g3(u) + [j]; , (5)

where the square brackets denote antisymmetrization, the (1)3 has been put in to outset
the 1 from (a1), and j;  is a bitensor antisymmetric in both primed and unprimed
indices . generalizing to higher form propagators is obvious. their gauge invariant part is
of the form:

ginvariant

1...p;

1...
p

= (1)p[1

1

u...p

pu + antipermutations of primed indices]gp(u).

(6)

the problem reduces therefore to nding the functions gp appearing in the propagators.
from [14] we know that the equations satised by g0, g1 and g2 for u 6= 0 are:

u(2 + u)g

0 + (d + 1)(1 + u)g

0 + 0(d  0)g0 = 0,

u(2 + u)g

u(2 + u)g

1 + (d + 1)(1 + u)g
2 + (d + 1)(1 + u)g

1 + 1(d  1)g1 = 0,

2 + 2(d  2)g2 = 0,

(7a)

(7b)

(7c)

where we arranged the last term knowing in advance how the equation for gp will look
like. there is another  function term in the right hand side, which insures that we use the
solution of (7a,b,c) which diverges as u  0, and gives the appropriate normalization to
the solution. we will be discussing this in chapter vi. we can now use poincare duality to
obtain the relations between gp and g0, g1 and g2.

iv. poincare duality

in d+1 dimensions with euclidean signature, a p form eld is poincare dual to a dp1

form eld by the relation

f1...p+112...d+1 = i(p + 1)! f p+2...d+1,

(8)

where the f s are the eld strengths. thus

1...

hf1...p+1(z)f

p+1(w)i12...d+1

d+1(w)i.
(9)
technically speaking, (9) contains also a contact term, but we will be concentrating for now
on u 6= 0 (chapters iv and v), and take it into account later (chapter vi). the correlation
function of the eld strengths is obtained by appropriately dierentiating the propagator.

d+1 = ((p + 1)!)2hf p+2...d+1(z)f 

p+2...

1

2...

if we apply poincare duality naively, we expect to obtain a relation between gp and
gdp1. indeed, in at space, the propagators are dual. on the other hand, adsd+1 behaves
like a box; more precisely, it is necessary to specify boundary conditions at  for the

3

solutions of the propagator equations. since the boundary conditions will not be in general
invariant under the duality, the propagators will not be dual in general (we will comment
on the duality between boundary conditions at the end of chapter vi). nevertheless, a
particular combination of the 2 solutions of one equation and of the 2 solutions of the other
will be. which combination it is depends on the particular duality we consider.
in the
case of a duality between a p form and a q form, we will use hp to denote the solution of
the equation for gp which satises this duality. we are not interested in what particular
combination of he solutions hp is; the only thing which we need to know about hp is that
it satises the same equation as gp.

in the case of the 0-form, we compare hfz0fz 

0

this insures that only indices dierent from z0 and z
the computation very much. for d = p + 1 we obtain from (6) and (9) after a few steps:

i with its left hand side counterpart in (9).
0 are summed over, which simplies

(2u+2)h 

p +dh 

p h

) = h 

0 (u2 +2u+2)+h 

0(u+1)(

w0
z0

+

z0
w0

)((1+u)h 

0 +h 

0).
(10)

since ( w0
z0

+ z0
w0

) can change with u constant and vice versa, (10) implies:

(2u + 2)h 

p + dh 

p = h 

0 (u2 + 2u + 2) + h 

0(u + 1)

combining (12),(11), and the equation for g0 (7a) which h0 also satises, we obtain:

h 

0 (1 + u) + h 

0 = h 
p

for d = p + 1.

(11)

(12)

(13a)

h 

0(1 + u) = h 
p

for d = p + 1.

in the case of the 1 form and 2 form we compare hfz0zifz 
with their counterparts in (9). we obtain after similar steps

1(1 + u) + h1 = h

for d = p + 2,

h 

2(1 + u) + 2h2 = h

for d = p + 3.

(13b)

(13c)

having these equations enables us to nd the propagator equations.

v. the p-form propagator equations

we rst examine the 3-form propagator. using (13a,b,c) and combining them with

(7a,b,c) we nd the equations g3 satises for d=4,5 and 6, u 6= 0 to be

u(2 + u)g

3 + 5(1 + u)g

3 + 3g3 = 0 for d = 4

u(2 + u)g

u(2 + u)g

3 + 6(1 + u)g
3 + 7(1 + u)g

3 + 6g3 = 0 for d = 5
3 + 9g3 = 0 for d = 6.

(14a)

(14b)

(14c)

to be more precise, (14a,b,c) are actually the equations satised by h3 in these dimensions.
one legitimate objection one may have is - are these equations the ones satised by g3,
or are they just some other equations satised by the particular combinations of solutions

4

which respect poincare duality. in appendix ii we will address this objection and show that
these equations are indeed the ones satised by g3.

based on the arguments presented above that the dimension only enters the equation for

gp linearly, the equation g3 satises is:

u(2 + u)g

3 + (d + 1)g

3 + 3(d  3)g3 = 0.

(15)

we can use the same procedure for the p-form in d = p + 1, d = p + 2 and d = p + 3, to

nd the equation for gp to be:

u(2 + u)g

p + (d + 1)(1 + u)g

p + p(d  p)gp = 0.

(16)

this reduces to (7a,b,c) for the 0,1 and 2 forms. once we have this equation it is very easy
to nd the propagators.

we can check whether the propagator equations we have are correct by using poincare
duality between the 3 form eld and a higher d  4 form eld in adsd+1. the equations for
both these propagators was found using our slick argument, and not by cranking through
i, with
the large number of terms in the equation of motion. by comparing hfz0zizjzk fz 
its counterpart in (9) we obtain:

j z 
k

0z 

iz 

(1 + u)h 

3 + 3h3 = h 
p

for d = p + 4.

(17)

it is very easy to check that using (17) and equation (15) for g3 we obtain the equation
(16) for gd4. thus, our approach is consistent. now, if we look at the relations derived
from poincare duality between hp and h0, h1, h2 and h3 (11a,b,c,16), it is impossible not
to observe a pattern. namely

(1 + u)h 

q + qhq = h 
p

for d = p + q + 1.

(18)

we can check this guess by plugging it in the equation for gp and obtaining the equation
for gq, and vice versa. as we can see, we uncovered the whole structure of relations between
the propagator equations and the poincare duality formulas.

vi. the propagators

f4 = 1

udp for d 6= 2p, and as f3 = 1
up ,

equation (16) is a second order hypergeometric dierential equation, which has 2 solu-
. as u   the solutions go

tions. near u = 0 the solutions go as f1 = c,
as f3 = 1
up . as we discussed, in
up ,
chapter iii, there is another  function term in (7a,b,c), which comes from the equations
p (equation (6) in [4] for the 2 form, equation (2.5) in [1] for the 1 form).
for g1...p;
we can see in the case of a general form that the  function appears in the equation for
g1...p;
p multiplying an antisymmetrized product of metrics, and that its sign will be
opposite to the sign of u(u + 2)g
p.

f4 = log u

f2 = 1

we expect the physical solution to be the one which diverges at the origin because of the
 function source. moreover, since we are in ads we impose the boundary condition that
the solution decays the fastest as u  .

5

using some hypergeometric functionology, we can see that the solution which decays
the fastest at  diverges at the origin, and that the one which is constant at the origin
decays the slowest at . thus, the solution which decays the slowest as u   is excluded.
there are 2 dierent cases, based on the relation between d and p. for d  1 < 2p the

solution is a hypergeometric function:

gp =

((d  1)/2)
4(d+1)/2u

d1

c f ( 2p+1d

2

, 1 + p  d, 2p + 1  d,

(2 + u)

2p+1d

2

2
2+u )

,

(19)

where c is a constant that normalizes the second fraction to 1 as u  0. the rst fraction
is a normalization constant which takes care of the  function discussed above. the hy-
pergeometric function has the third coecient negative, and can be simplied to a rational
function.

for d + 1 > 2p the solution is also hypergeometric:

gp =

((d  1)/2)
4(d+1)/2u

d1

2

c f ( d+12p

2

, 1  p, d + 1  2p,

(2 + u)

d+12p

2

2
2+u )

,

(20)

where c is a constant similar to the previous case. this solution can also be simplied to a
rational function. the ranges of validity overlap at d = 2p, where the solutions also overlap.
as promised, we now come back to the invariance of boundary conditions under poincare
duality. equation (18) is obeyed by our solutions for p > q only (it is easy to see this by
looking at their behavior at ). equation (18) was obtained by contracting with the  tensor
the indices of the p-form propagator which were dierent from z0. we therefore conclude
that the boundary conditions for the components of the higher form eld strength which do
not contain z0 are dual to the boundary conditions for the components of the lower form
eld strength which contain z0.

it is interesting to observe how much we obtained using just poincare duality and a few

general properties of propagators in ads.

appendix b: on the link between the equation for hp and the

one for gp

we know that hp is a combination of the 2 solutions of the equation for gp. nevertheless,
if we know the equation satised by hp it is not in clear that this is the equation gp satises.
we will try to determine under what conditions can hp satisfy 2 dierent equations of a
similar form. in order to do this we need to go a bit through the gory details associated
with nding the equation for gp.

we will review the general procedure of obtaining the equation for gp. the reader who is
interested in more details can look up the derivations for p = 1 and p = 2 in [1] respectively
[4].

the equation gp satises comes from the equation for g1...p;

1...

p, which for u 6= 0 is :

dd[g1...p];

1...

p  d[

1

1...p;

1...

p1] = 0,

(b1)

is a dieomorphism
where the square brackets denote antisymmetrization and 1...p;
whose contribution vanishes when integrated against a covariantly conserved current. the
gauge non-invariant part of the propagator does not appear in the equation because it is
itself the exterior derivative of a current.

1...

p1

similar to the case of 2-form propagators, there are 2 bitensors which form a basis for

antisymmetric bitensors:

t 1
1...p;

1...
p

= 1

1

u...p

pu + antipermutations of primed indices

(b2)

t 2
1...p;

1...
p

= 1u 

1

u 2

2

u...p 

pu + antipermutations of all indices.

also, 1...p;

1...

p1

is a bitensor and can be expressed as:

1...p;

1...

p1

= a(u)[1

1

u...p1

p1

u p u + antipermutations of unprimed indices],
(b3)

where a(u) is a scalar function.

it is possible to express (b1) as a sum of 2 expressions multiplying these 2 bitensors
being equal to 0. these 2 expressions must be individually equal to 0. since they contain
gp(u) and a(u), we can eliminate a(u) and obtain an equation for gp.

using (6), we can see that the expression multiplying t 1 will contain:
- u(u + 2)g

p coming from u u g

p (using a5);

7

- (u + 1)g
- gp coming from the 2 covariant derivatives acting on factors of the form i

p coming from iu g

p and u g

p (using a4);

j

a9);

- a(u) coming from the partial derivative acting on p u.
thus, the general equation obtained from t 1 will look like:

u(u + 2)g

p + b(u + 1)g

p + cgp = da(u),

where b, c, d are constants. similarly, the expression multiplying t 2 will contain:

p coming from 

p coming from di

- (u + 1)g
- g
- a(u) coming from the partial derivative acting on a(u).
thus the general equation obtained from t 1 will look like:

p (using a8);

p (using a7);

u u iu g

u u g

j

j

(u + 1)g

p + kg

p = la(u),

u (using

(b4)

(b5)

with k and l constants. we can integrate (b5) once, set the integration constant to 0 (so
that both sides vanish as u  ), and combine it with (b4) to obtain the general form of
the equation for gp:

u(u + 2)g

p + m(u + 1)g

p + ngp = 0,

(b6)

where m and n some constants. if we had gone through the large number of terms in (b1)
we would have determined m and n.

we are now ready to explore the logical possibility that (14a,b,c) are just equations
satised by the particular combinations of solutions giving hp and not the equations satised
by gp.

if gp satises another equation, it must be of the form (b6) and hp must also satisfy it.
since hp satises 2 dierent (b6)-like equations, it must be of the form hp = (1 + u), where
 is any number. clearly (1 + u) cannot satisfy (14a,b,c),(15) or (16) for p > 2 (which is
the case of interest). therefore (14a,b,c) are indeed the equations satised by g3 q.e.d.
