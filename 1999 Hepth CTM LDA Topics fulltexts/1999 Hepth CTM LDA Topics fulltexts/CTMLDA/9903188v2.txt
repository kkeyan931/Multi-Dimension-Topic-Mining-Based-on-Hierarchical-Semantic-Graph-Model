we apply the dmrg method to the 2 dimensional delta function potential which is a simple
quantum mechanical model with asymptotic freedom and formation of bound states. the system
block and the environment block of the dmrg contain the low energy and high energy degrees of
freedom, respectively. the ground state energy and the lowest excited states are obtained with very
high accuracy. we compare the dmrg method with the similarity rg method and propose its
generalization to eld theoretical models in high energy physics.

a hallmark of an asymptotically free theory such as
qcd is that it contains many degrees of freedom, with
very dierent energy scales, which are coupled by the in-
teraction hamiltonian. perturbative methods are valid
for short distance physics but they fail for small momen-
tum transfers or for energy scales where the bound states
are formed. the existence of multiple energy scales sug-
gests that the renormalization group approach is the
correct strategy to attack these non perturbative prob-
lems.
in recent years there has been several proposals
to extract eective low energy hamiltonians using rg
methods. of particular interest is the light-front hamil-
tonian approach advocated in references [1,2] which uses
a similarity rg method (srg) [3,4]. in this method the
rg ow is given by an unitary transformation which di-
agonalizes the hamiltonian by succesive elimination of
the o-diagonal matrix elements. the srg-cuto can
be seen as the width of the band which contains the non
vanishing o-diagonal matrix elements of the hamilto-
nian. at the end of the srg ow the width is zero and
the corresponding hamiltonian contains in its diagonal
all the eigenvalues of the original one.

in this letter we shall propose an alternative rg ap-
proach to study asymptotically free models using the
density matrix renormalization group (dmrg). we
shall also show the relations and dierences between the
dmrg and the srg methods. the dmrg was proposed
by white in 1992 to solve the problems of the old real
space rg methods encountered in the 70s, which led in
those days to their abandon in favour of montecarlo tech-
niques [5]. the dmrg has by now become a standard
numerical rg method applied to many body problems
in condensed matter and other branches of physics ( see
references [6,7] for reviews). it is thus challenging to test
how the dmrg handles the subtle dynamics of asymp-
totically free theories. to our knowledge this is the rst
paper devoted to the subject. for this reason we have
choosen as a theoretical lab a simple model possesing the
essential properties of asymptotic freedom and formation

of bound states, which are shared by realistic theories like
qcd.

the natural candidate for such a simple model is pro-
vided by a 2d quantum mechanical particle subject to
a delta function potential [8]. the solution of the 2d
delta function schrodinger equation requires a regular-
ization and renormalization schemes as in an ordinary
quantum eld theory. we shall use for our purposes the
lattice regularization introduced by glazek and wilson
in their srg study of the problem [9,10]. these authors
formulated the problem in momentum space where the
states are labelled by an integer n that ranges between
an infrared cuto m and an ultraviolet cuto n (i.e.
m  n  n ). the kinetic energy en of the state n in-
creases exponentially as en = b2n, where b is an arbitrary
constant greater than one. for numerical computations
we shall take the value b = 2 as in references [9,10].
the interaction hamiltonian between the states n and m
is given by genem, where g is the coupling constant

of the problem. the discrete lattice hamiltonian h is
dened by the matrix elements

hnm = n,mb2n  g bn+m, m  n, m  n

(1)

an overall shift of the levels by a constant term, i.e. n 
n + n0, implies that hnm scales with the factor b2n0.
this is a discrete version of scale invariance, which is
broken by the infrared and ultraviolets cutos m and n .
the latter symmetry implies that all the scales contribute
to the observables, which makes very hard an accurate
determination of their value by methods other than the
exact one.

the rst step in the dmrg method is the partition of
the system in two pieces called the system block and the
environment block [5]. in our case we shall choose the
system block bl
 to be given by the low energy levels n
which lie between the infrared cuto m and the scale 
(i.e. m  n  ), while the environment block bh
 will
contain the high energy levels n between the ultraviolet
cuto n and the scale  (i.e.   n  n ). the whole

1

system, with energy levels ranging from m to n , is ob-
tained as the superblock bl
+3, where  and 
are the n =  + 1 and n =  + 2 energy levels respectively
(see g.1).

the parameter  varies from m to n  3 and it labels
the dmrg ow. let us supose we want to nd the gs
of the whole system. we shall choose a trial gs wave
function (n) as follows,

(n) =

where l ( resp. r+3) is a normalized vector which
describes the contribution of the low ( resp. high) energy

bh
+3. the ansatz (2) is the momentum space version of
the real space dmrg applied by white to study a free
particle in a box [6,7]. our approach is close in spirit to
the momentum space dmrg method proposed by xiang
[11]. the energy of the state (2) can be conveniently
written as

h|h|i = ha|hsb()|ai

(3)

where |ai is the vector (a1, a2, a3, a4) and the superblock
hamiltonian hsb() is the 4  4 matrix given by

hsb() =

hl hl hl hlh
hl h h hh
hl h
h hh
hlh hh hh hh







(4)

whose entries read

hl = hl|h|li,
h = h+1,+1,
hl = p
hh = pn
hh = pn

hh = hr+3|h|r+3i
h = h+2,+2
hl = p

n=m hn,+1l(n),
n=+3 hn,+1r+3(n), hlh = hl|h|r+3i
n=+3 hn,+2r+3(n) h = h+2,+3

n=m hn,+2l(n)

(5)

where hn,m are the matrix elements given in eq. (1). no-
tice that eq.(3) takes the form of an eigenvalue problem
in a reduced vector space with only 4 degrees of free-
dom. the gs of the superblock can be found by looking
for the lowest eigenvalue e1() of the 4  4 matrix hsb.

the variational nature of the construction gives an upper
bound of the exact gs energy. if the vectors l and r+3
coincide with the low energy and high energy pieces of
the exact gs wave function then the dmrg algorithm
presented so far would reproduce the exact result. of
course this is not in general the case but nevertheless,
one can actually use the dmrg algorithm to improve
in succesive steps the gs energy. the idea is to apply
a continuity argument. suppose we shift the scale  to
the next high energy level, say  + 1. then the new low
energy vector l
+1 will be related to the previous one l
by the equation

where (a

the energy h

by

l( + 1) fully characterize the new
block bl
+1 which can be regarded as the renormalization
of the block bl
 . the next step is to construct the su-
perblock bl
+4 which by the same techniques leads
to the construction of a new block bl
+2 and so on. this
procedure is iterated until the scale  = n  3, where one
reverses the dmrg steps in order to update the high en-
ergy blocks bh
 using the low energy blocks built in the
previous steps. after a few sweeps from low to high en-
ergy and viceversa the lowest eigenvalue of the superblock
hamiltonian (4) converges to a x value which gives the
dmrg estimation of the gs energy. to start out the
process one has to grow up the system to its actual size.
this can be done by considering superblocks of the form
bl
m +pbh
n p where p = 0, . . . , (n  m  3)/2. the last
value of p yields a system containing all the scales from
m to n . the low and high energy blocks constructed
in the warm up are the starting point for the sweeping
procedure explained above (see [6,7] for details). the
previous algorithm has been generalized in reference [12]
to nd out not only the gs but the low lying excitations
as well.

let us now present our dmrg results for the case
considered in references [9,10], where m = 21, n = 16
and g = 0.06060600032108866. the latter value of g is
choosen in such a way that the exact ground state energy
of (1) is given exactly by 1. the dmrg algorithm
presented above gives the exact ground state energy with
an error of 1014 (see table 1). using the extension of
the dmrg proposed in [12] we have also computed the
gs and the lowest 3 excited states of the hamiltonian

(1). in table 1 we compare our dmrg results with the
exact ones in terms of the relative deviation

eigenstates of the hamiltonian (1).

as shown in table 1 the accuracy of the excited states
energies is lower than that of the gs. this feature is
peculiar to the delta function hamiltonian and it does
not arise for the quantum mechanical models studied in
[12]. there are several reasons for the very high accuracy
of the dmrg applied to the hamiltonian (1):
i) the
dmrg gives a variational upper bound to the exact gs
energy which is usually improved in every dmrg step;
ii) all the matrix elements of the whole hamiltonian are
used many times to feedback the superblock so that no
information is lost; iii) the dmrg method focus on the
determination of the gs and the low lying states.

in g.2 we plot the dmrg wave function which after
the third sweep is indistinguishable from the exact one.

it is interesting to investigate the nature of the dmrg
ow as compared with the one of the similarity rg
method.
in the srg the eective hamiltonian h(s)
evolves as a function of s according to the wegner equa-
tion [4],

dh(s)

ds

= [[hd(s), h(s)], h(s)]

(9)

where hd(s) is the diagonal part of h(s). the initial
condition of eq.(9) is h(0) = h, where h is the origi-
nal hamiltonian of the problem. the parameter s ranges
from 0 to  and it can be identied with the inverse
square of the energy width , i.e. s = 1/2. eq. (9)

3

implies that h(s) is related to h by an unitary transfor-
mation and therefore they share their eigenvalues. when
s increases, the o diagonal matrix elements of h(s), lo-
cated at distances greater than the width  = 1/s, be-
come very small. when s =  the eective hamiltonian
h() is diagonal and all its entries coincide with the
eigenvalues of h. the numerical integration of eq.(9) re-
quires of course to follow the evolution of all the entries
of h. one would like instead to project the eective
hamiltonians to smaller (window) matrices in order to
reproduce the bound state eigenvalue [10]. in a sense, the
superblock 44 matrices (4) resemble the window matri-
ces of ref. [10]. motivated by the srg ideas [10], we have
studied the rg ow of the eigenvalues ei()(i = 1, . . . , 4)
of the superblock hamiltonian (4). in g.3 we plot the
lowest eigenvalue e1, together with the remaining ones
scaled down by a factor b2. we can clearly see from g.3
that e1 stays constant through all the dmrg steps while
ei(i = 2, 3, 4) vary with the energy scale b2 with some
deviations depending on the energy region. the plateaus
correspond to low energy regions while the oscillations
and bumps occur for intermediate and high energies. to
a rst order approximation, which is almost exact for the
plateaus, the superblock hamiltonian (4) can be written
as

hsb() = o

where o is a unitary matrix. using eq.(10) one can show
that the superblock hamiltonians satisfy the following
second order recursion relation,

hsb() =

(12)

where  = do
 . eq.(13) is a second order diferential
equation which is to be compared with the rst order
equation eq.(9). the dmrg ow is a sort of similarity
transformation with some eigenvalues running with the
scale. using the standard rg terminology the lowest
eigenvalue e1 can be associated with a marginal operator
while the eigenvalues ei for i = 2, 3, 4 are associated
with infrared irrelevant operators which vanish at the
xed point hamiltonian hsb( = m ).
indeed all the
entries of hsb( = m ) are very small except for the
entry hh = 0.999 whose value is close to the bound
state energy. these results suggest that the exactness
of the dmrg method is due to a careful treatment of

the irrelevants operators, which in other rg methods
are dicult to control in general.

from a conceptual point of view the dmrg oers a
new way of thinking about cutos and rg ows in high
energy physics. traditional cutos remove high energy
states while the lowering of the cuto produces eec-
tive operators for lower energies [13]. in the lagrangian
formulation this strategy can be implemented perturba-
tively without much diculty. however in the hamilto-
nian formulation it gives rise to small denominators prob-
lems involving energy dierences between the states kept
and the states truncated in the rg process [14,9]. this
latter problems do not arise in the dmrg truncation
for it uses a non perturbative self-consistent algorithm to
nd the best choice of the eective hilbert spaces and
hamiltonians.

the next step in the application of the dmrg to high
energy physics is of course to consider eld theoretical
models with asymptotic freedom and bound states.

the most appropriate formalism for this application of
the dmrg is known as discrete light-cone quantiza-
tion in momentum space (dlcq) [15], [16]. in the dlcq
approach the hilbert space is nite dimensional and the
light-front hamiltonian hlc acting on it is similar to
that of a many-body hamiltonian in condensed matter
[16]. the search for bound states amounts to solving the
schroedinger equation

this is a systematic procedure with no wild guessing
about the wave function. a given block will contain the
most representative multiparticle and momentum states
in order to reconstruct the lowest lying bound states. on
the other hand, the dmrg is a numerical method, un-
like the more analytical srg method [17], and does not
need perturbative inputs. the basic requirement for the
dmrg method to work is a discretized hamiltonian act-
ing on nite dimensional hilbert spaces. as a rst test of
this program we have solved eq.(13) for the positronium
state of the massive and massless schwinger model in the
one-fermion sector with the dmrg. these results will be
reported elsewhere.

thefore, we expect that the main ideas presented in
this letter can be generalized to the dlcq hamiltoni-
ans. specically, the breaking of the system into low
energy and high energy blocks which are constantly up-
dated through the dmrg process. on the other hand
the dmrg method combined with the dlcq approach
does not have the sign problems that emerge in the mon-
tecarlo methods used in lattice gauge theories [16]. in
summary, we believe that the power shown in condensed
matter systems by the dmrg method is worthwhile to
be translated into particle physics.

where m 2 is the mass of the bound state. thus, one
can apply to (13) standard diagonalization techniques
such as lanczos. the dmrg method allows us to study
larger hilbert spaces than those achieved with the lanc-
zos method. this is needed in order to recover the con-
tinuum limit of hlc .

the key to make the clever truncation of states in the
rg process is given by the density matrix of the blocks.
