moduli space of vacua of supersymmetric

chern-simons theories and type iib branes

abstract

we study the correspondence between the moduli space of vacua of three-dimensional

supersymmetric yang-mills (maxwell) chern-simons theories and brane congurations

with (p, q)5-brane. for coulomb branches, the number of the massless adjoint scalar

elds in various supersymmetric theories exactly coincides with the number of the freely

moving directions of d3-branes stretched between two 5-branes. when we include a

matter supereld into the supersymmetric chern-simons theory two distinct symmetric

and asymmetric phase appears. the symmetric phase is peculiar to this chern-simons

higgs system. we nd the corresponding brane conguration for these phases. we also

identify the stringy counterpart of the topological vortex state in the asymmetric phase.

1 introduction

recent developments in string theory are understandings of the correspondence between

the brane dynamics and the physics of gauge theories in various dimensions. hanany

and witten have rst pointed out [1] that n=4 supersymmetric gauge theory in three-

dimensions is realized as worldvolume eective theory on d3-branes stretched between two

ns5-branes and the mirror symmetry can be understand as a consequence of sl(2, z)

duality of type iib superstring theory.

their construction is extended to dierent numbers of supersymmetries [2, 3] and

gauge theory in various dimensions (for a review see [4, 5]). the advantage of this approach

is that we can geometrically analyze the structure of the moduli spaces of vacua as the

conguration space of branes. the geometrical construction of moduli space make easy

to classify possible supersymmetric vacuum.

from the point of view of brane solutions in type iib superstring theory, the three-

dimensional hanany-witten type conguration is generalized to the case including rotated

5-branes at arbitrary angles [6]. it contain the interesting 5-brane solution preserving 3/16

of supersymmetry. this means that in three-dimensions we have n=3 supersymmetric

theory. one of the realization of the three-dimensional n=3 supersymmetry is obtained

by adding the chern-simons term [7, 8, 9]. so the brane conguration with 3/16 super-

symmetry can be associated with three-dimensional chern-simons theory.

moreover, the systematic classication of possible hanany-witten type conguration

with various supersymmetries has been studied in ref.

[10]. since the type iib brane

conguration with 3/16 supersymmetry contains a (p, q)5-brane which is a bound state

of ns5 and d5-brane, it is reasonable to consider that the replacement of one of the ns5-

branes with the (p, q)5-brane is related to adding the chern-simons interaction. under

this identication, it is found that the vacuum structure of maxwell chern-simons theory

is consistent with the brane picture and a mirror symmetry is similarly realized by

type iib s-duality. this mirror symmetry in supersymmetric chern-simons theory is

recently conrmed by using a generalized fourier transformation in ref. [11].

in this paper, we investigate the correspondence between the (p, q)5-brane congu-

ration introduced by ref.

[10] and yang-mills (maxwell) chern-simons theories in de-

1

tail. more specically, we construct a explicit lagrangian for the supersymmetric chern-

simons theories and identify vevs of emergent elds with moduli parameters of type iib

branes. this identication gives us the knowledge to understand the complicated dynam-

ics of three-dimensional massive gauge theories and the dynamics of type iib branes.

this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we briey review the construction of

the brane congurations with (p.q)5-brane. these congurations in type iib theory are

reduced from m5-brane congurations in m-theory with various supersymmetries. we

give all possible hanany-witten type conguration with n2 supersymmetry. in section

3, we see how to describe the coulomb branch by vevs of adjoint scalars in supersymmetric

chern-simons theory. the number of the adjoint scalar elds corresponds to the number of

freely moving directions of d3-branes. finally, we consider the vacuum of maxwell chern-

simons theory with matter superelds. in this model, there are two distinct vacua. one

of vacua, which is called as a symmetric phase, exists on in the maxwell chern-simons

higgs system. we can nd the brane conguration of the symmetric phase. we also

identify the topological vortex in the asymmetric phase as a bound state of strings.

2 supersymmetric conguration with (p, q)5-brane

in this section we briey review the construction of the brane conguration with (p, q)5-

brane.

the brane congurations in type iib string theory which are given by hanany and

witten [1] describe three dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories. in this congura-

tion d3-branes are suspended between two parallel ns5-branes and the 3 + 1 dimensional

worldvolume of d3-brane is compactied on a nite line segment. we denote the extended

directions of two ns5-branes and nc d3-branes as the following symbols:

2  ns5 :

(012345),

nc  d3 :

(012|6|),

where the numbers in the parenthesis are the worldvolume directions and the vertical lines

on both side of 6 mean that the worldvolume of d3-branes are restricted to nite interval

in the x6-direction. the left ns5-brane is located at x6 = l/2 and the right is at

2

x6 = l/2.

the low-energy eective theory on nc parallel d3-branes is 3 + 1 dimensional su(nc)

supersymmetric yang-mills theory in the limit that string scale ls goes to zero, but this

compactication on the line reduces the d3-brane worldvolume theory to 2+1 dimensions.

upon this kaluza-klein reduction on the line segment we nd the gauge coupling constant

g of this worldvolume theory is given by

1
g2 =

l
gs

,

(2.1)

where gs is a string coupling constant of type iib theory and l is a length of the line
segment, namely, a distance between two ns5-branes in the x6-direction.

in this conguration the presence of these two kinds of branes preserves 8 of 32 super-

charges of type iib string theory since each kind of brane preserves half of supercharges.

therefore we have n=4 supersymmetry in 2 + 1 dimensions.

to add matter in the fundamental representation of the gauge group we can introduce

nf d5-branes, which have the worldvolume:

nf  d5 :

(012789),

without breaking any supersymmetries. the matter hypermultiplets come from strings

stretched between the nc suspended d3-branes and the nf d5-branes. so nf represents

the number of avors.

in addition to these types of branes there also exists the (p, q)5-brane which is a bound

state of ns5- and d5-branes. one of the extension of the above setup is replacement of

the right ns5-brane in the hanany-witten conguration with this (p, q)5-brane. however,

if we simply substitute the (p, q)5-brane for the right ns5-brane and the left ns5-brane

and the right (p, q)5-brane is parallel then all supersymmetry is broken. to preserve some

of the supercharges we must rotate the (p, q)5-brane by some angles.

in order to count the residual supercharges we now lift the above type iib cong-

uration to m5- and m2-brane congurations in m-theory. t-duality in the x2-direction

maps the ns5-brane and the d5-brane into the ns5-brane and the d4-brane in type

iia theory, respectively. by lifting to m-theory these objects become m5-branes. the

ns5-brane corresponds to the m5-brane wrapping on the x2-direction and the d5-brane

3

corresponds to the m5-brane wrapping on the 11th-direction x10. so two cycles of the

torus t 2 with coordinates (x2, x10) are related to nsns-charge and rr-charge in type

iib theory. similarly, (p, q)5-brane in type iib theory is also unied as a m5-brane which

is obliquely wrapping on the torus t 2 at some angle . this angle and charges of the

(p, q)5-brane are related each other as follows

tan  =

2r10p
2r2q

= gs

p
q

,

(2.2)

where r2 and r10 are radii of the torus t 2.

using the above procedure d3-branes in type iib theory become m2-branes stretched

between two m5-branes in m-theory. in this situation the right m5-brane tilted by the

angle  can be rotated by more three angles in the conguration space of m-theory. so,

we have a general conguration in m-theory:

m5 :

(012345)

nc  m2 :

m5

:

(01|6|)

(01(cid:20) 2

10(cid:21)(cid:20) 3

7(cid:21)(cid:20)4

9(cid:21)
8(cid:21)(cid:20)5

),

means that the extended direction of the m5-brane are rotated

where the symbol h 
i

by the angle  in the (x, x)-space. if the angle  is zero m5-brane become a rotated

ns5-brane in type iib conguration space. on the other hand, the case of  = /2

corresponds to a d5-brane.

the presence of these branes imposes the constrains on the 11-dimensional killing

spinors  [12]

the numbers of the remaining supersymmetry are obtained by solving eqs. (2.3)-(2.5)

simultaneously. all possible solutions are completely classied in ref. [10] by setting some

4

relations between four angles and we have 1/16, 1/8, 3/16 and 1/4 of the original 32 super-

charges. these fractions of supersymmetry correspond to n=1, 2, 3, 4 supersymmetries,

respectively, in 2 + 1 dimensions.

in present paper we treat only the conguration for n2 supersymmetry. this is

because quantum corrections of higher supersymmetric is suppressed rather than the

n=1 case and it is not so complicated to nd the correspondence to the branelogy.

n2 supersymmetric congurations are divided into the following two cases. one is

the ns5 conguration with n=2, 4 supersymmetry where the right 5-brane is the ns5-

brane. the other is the conguration including (p, q)5-brane with n=2, 3.

we rst consider the ns5 conguration. for n=4 conguration we must set all angles

to zero,  =  =  =  = 0. the right m5-brane is a ns5-brane in type iib theory, which

is parallel to the left ns5-brane. this is nothing but the hanany-witten conguration.

as we mentioned above, this conguration describes n=4 su(nc) supersymmetric yang-

mills theory. this theory includes three real scalar elds in adjoint representation. vevs

of these adjoint scalars and scalars dual to the gauge elds parametrize the coulomb

branch. on the other hand, d3-branes in the brane conguration can freely move along

the (x3, x4, x5)-space. these positions of d3-branes on ns5-brane correspond to the vevs

of real adjoint scalars. in addition the so(3) rotation group in the (x3, x4, x5) can be

identied with a part of the r-symmetry su(2)v of n=4 supersymmetry algebra in three

dimensions. the other part of the r-symmetry su(2)h corresponds to rotations in the
(x7, x8, x9)-space.

the n=2 ns5 conguration is obtained by a rotation of the right ns5-brane.

in

this rotation we must set same values on two pairs of angles. since  is zero in ns5

conguration one of our choice for angles is  =  = 0 and  =  6= 0. the special case of

 =  = /2 is investigated in ref. [2] and this brane conguration space well describes

the moduli space of vacua of n=2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory. the coulomb

branch of this theory is parametrized by vevs of one real massless adjoint scalar and dual

gauge elds. in this conguration d3-branes can not move in the (x3, x4)-space any longer

since two ns5-branes are completely twisted in that space. then the vev of real adjoint

scalar corresponds to the positions of d3-branes in x5-direction. for the general value of 

this rotation angle is related to a mass of two real adjoint scalars [13, 14], which originally

5

belong to the n=4 vector multiplet. therefore we can identify the rotation of ns5-brane

with the supplement of the mass term of two adjoint scalars into n=4 theory. actually,

this brane rotation breaks the su(2)v  su(2)h rotation symmetry to so(2)  u(1)r,

which coincide with the n=2 r-symmetry group.

let us next mention about the conguration with (p, q)5-brane. this conguration is

realized by setting  6= 0.

a maximal supersymmetric conguration with (p, q)5-brane is the case of  =  =  =

. this conguration preserves n=3 supersymmetry in 2 + 1 dimensions. since the all

rotation angles are same except for the signature, the rotation symmetry su(2)v su(2)h
in the (x3, x4, x5)- and (x7, x8, x9)-spaces breaks to a diagonal su(2)d. this rotational

symmetry su(2)d can be considered as the r-symmetry of the three-dimensional n=3

supersymmetry algebra.

n=2 conguration is given by setting  =  6=  = , that is, two dierent sets

of same angles.

if we take  =  = 0, then we have the n=2 ns5 conguration as

mentioned above. similarly, we can choose as  =  = 0. in this case the right 5-brane

is (p, q)5-brane but still n=2 supersymmetric.

it is eld theoretically shown that the three-dimensional n=3 maximal supersymmet-

ric system can be constructed by adding chern-simons terms [7, 8, 9]. so one expect [6]

that the worldvolume eective theory on this 2 + 1-dimensional intersection of rotated 5-

branes is gauge theories with chern-simons terms. in fact, since there exists a non-trivial

vev of axion (rr-scalar) eld c0 around (p, q)5-brane in type iib theory, the coupling

r c0f  f on the d3-brane induces the chern-simons term with coupling  = p/q [10].

in the following section, we investigate the correspondence between these supersym-

metric congurations with the (p, q)5-brane and the moduli space of vacua of chern-

simons theories.

3.1 n =3 supersymmetric yang-mills chern-simons theory

we rst begin with the n=3 conguration. the conguration in type iib theory is

written as follows in the notation of the previous section:

(012345)

(p, q)5 :

(012|6|)

(01(cid:20)3

8(cid:21)(cid:20)5

),

where  = tan1(cid:16)gs

p

q(cid:17). there originally exists su(nc) yang-mills gauge theory on the

d3-branes. as we have explained, the right (p, q)5-brane provides the chern-simons term

into the yang-mills theory. so we have the yang-mills chern-simons theory as the eec-

tive theory on this conguration. the coupling constant of chern-simons term is given

by  = p/q. however, the coupling constant of the non-abelian chern-simons theory

should be a integer in order to preserve gauge invariance under a large transformation.

therefore we set the charges of (p, q)5-brane as (p, q) = (n, 1).

n=3 supersymmetric eld theory in three dimensions has the su(2)d r-symmetry.

the vector multiplet contains one spin 1 massive vector eld a, three spin 1/2 spinors

i, three spin 0 real adjoint elds xi and one spin 1/2 spinor . three spinors and

adjoint scalars form a triplet under su(2)d. the bosonic part of the lagrangian of this

n=3 supersymmetric yang-mills chern-simons theory is given by [9]

corresponds to the limit   0 in the brane conguration, one obtains the n=4 super-

symmetric pure yang-mills lagrangian.

the coulomb branch of supersymmetric gauge theory is described by solutions of the

following atness condition for the adjoint scalar elds

m 2xi 

m
2

ijk [xj, xk]  [xj, [xi, xj]] = 0.

(3.3)

7

for real xi, the general solution of this condition is hxii = 0. so the coulomb branch of

this theory is completely lifted because of the mass term coming from the chern-simons

interaction.

from the point of view of the brane conguration,

it is easy to understand this

coulomb branch moduli as the following. in the n=4 brane conguration, nc d3-branes
can freely moved on the (x3, x4, x5)-space since two ns5-branes are parallel. so we can

identify positions of d3-branes in the (x3, x4, x5)-space with vevs of the three real adjoint

scalar elds, which describe a part of the coulomb branch.

however, in the n=3 conguration, since the left ns5-brane and the right (p, q)5-

brane is completely twisted in (x3, x4, x5)- and (x7, x8, x9)-space, d3-branes can not move

anywhere. this means that the corresponding vevs of the adjoint scalars must be at

origin, namely, hxii = 0, which coincide with the solution of the atness condition (3.3).

the mass of the adjoint scalars can be written in terms of the rotation angle of the

(p, q)5-brane as

where we use the relation (2.1) and (2.2). this relation also agree with the results in ref.

[13, 14].

in the   0 limit the mass of the adjoint scalar elds vanishes and at the same time the

chern-simons interaction is dropped. in the brane conguration the right (p, q)5-brane

become ns5-brane and to be parallel to the left ns5. so we have n=4 supersymmetric

pure yang-mills theory. on the other hand, in the limit   /2 the mass of the vector

multiplet goes to innity and all gauge degrees of freedom are decoupled. in this limit

the right (p, q)5-brane become d5-brane which extends in the (x0, x1, x2, x7, x8, x9)-space.

this conguration also recover the n=4 supersymmetry again and appears in the higgs

branch of the hanany-witten conguration [1].

3.2 breaking to n =2

we next consider the supersymmetry breaking of n=3 theory down to n=2. in the brane

language this is done by making two of the angles dierent from the others. namely, we

as the result, the corresponding mass of the adjoint scalars become dierent.

we can eld theoretically understand this supersymmetry breaking. originally n=3

vector multiplet contains the elds (a, i, xi, ). if we give the dierent mass  to the

x1, x2 and 3, , these elds form the n=2 neutral chiral supermultiplet . the rests

of the elds (a, a, x3) are contents of the n=2 vector multiplet, which still have the

4(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12).
mass (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) g2

in this n=2 theory three adjoint scalars are massive as long as  6= 0. so the coulomb

branch of this theory is still lifted and there is no moduli. this corresponds to the twisting

conguration of the ns5-brane and the rotated (p, q)5-brane. however, if we set  = 0 the

ns5-brane and (p, q)5-brane become parallel in the (x3, x4)-space. therefore d3-branes
can now freely move in the (x3, x4)-space. in this conguration, two adjoint scalars x1

and x2 become massless and the coulomb branch appears.

4 broken and unbroken phases of abelian theory

in this section we consider the higgs branches of the n=2 supersymmetric chern-simons

theory. we rst briey review the description of the higgs branch in the hanany-witten

conguration. the inclusion of the matter hypermultiplets corresponds to the addition of

the d5-branes, which extend in the (x0, x1, x2, x7, x8, x9)-space, between two ns5-branes.

the matter hypermultiplets come from the open string stretched between d5-branes and

d3-branes1. for simplicity, we consider only abelian theory with one matter hypermul-

tiplet, which includes two complex scalar elds (q,eq) from now on.

if we denote the distance between the d5-brane and the d3-brane in the (x3, x4, x5)-

1there is a couple of chiral elds with opposite chirality with respect to orientation of strings.

9

space as d, the mass of the hypermultiplet is given by

m = tf1d =

d
2ls

2 ,

(4.1)

where tf1 is the string tension and ls is the string length.

in the decoupling limit of

massive excitation of strings ls  0, the quantity of m must be xed.

the higgs branch of this theory emanates from the point where the hypermultiplet

is massless, namely, d = 0 in the brane conguration. when d = 0, the d5-brane can

separate the d3-brane into two parts. as the result, two ns5-branes can shift each others

positions in the (x7, x8, x9)-space. we denote this dierence as ed.

the gauge symmetry in this branch is completely broken since the d3-brane is divided

into two parts by the d5-brane and all gauge degrees of freedom are decoupled. in the

broken phase of the abelian gauge theory, there exists a vortex state, which is an electric-

magnetic dual object of the fundamental matter. since the electric-magnetic duality of

the brane eective theory is achieved by the type iib s-duality, the stringy counterpart

of the vortex state is a d-string stretched between two separated parts of d3-brane. the

mass of this state is

where els = gs

1/2ls is a string length of the dual theory. filed theoretically, the mass of

the vortex state is given by the fayet-iliopoulos (fi) parameter . if we dene as

2 ,

2els

4

=

ed
82els

2 ,

(4.3)

the fi parameter is proportional to the dierence of two ns5-brane positions in the x9-

direction.

next, we consider a similar situation in the n=2 brane conguration with (p, q)5-

brane. we add only one set of massless matter superelds which plays a role of higgs

eld and consider the abelian case, that is, the maxwell chern-simons higgs system.

moreover, we set the angles  to /2 in the n=2 brane conguration. so the brane

conguration is as follows

ns5 :

(012345)

10

d3 :

(012|6|)

d5 :

(012789)

(p, q)5 :  01278(cid:20)5

9(cid:21)! .

the two adjoint scalars x1 and x2 are decoupled from the theory and so we can easily

pay attention to the true nature of the higgs phase of the abelian theory.

the squark higgs elds q,eq in the matter superelds couple to a non-dynamical d-

eld in the o-shell vector multiplet. if we integrate out the auxiliary d-eld we have a

bosonic scalar potential

v = 

where  is the fi parameter.

(4.4)

the potential of the aforementioned maxwell higgs theory is obtained by setting

 = x3 = 0. in this case there is only the asymmetric phase |q|2  |eq|2 = . however, the

potential (4.4) admits two distinct vacua, an asymmetric phase and a symmetric phase.

we examine the correspondence between each branch and the brane conguration from

now on.

asymmetric phase

the asymmetric phase is described by |q|2  |eq|2 =  and x3 = 0. this phase is the

same as the asymmetric phase in the previous case. so the corresponding conguration

is also very similar to the maxwell higgs one. namely, the d5-brane divide the d3-

brane into two segments. one of the segments of the d3-brane stretch between the left

ns5-brane and the d5-brane and the other is between the d5-brane and the right (p, q)5-

brane. in this phase the relative position of the 5-branes along the x9-direction can dier

because of this split of the d3-brane and the gauge symmetry on the d3-brane is broken

simultaneously. we denote the dierence of 5-branes in the x9-direction as ed. (see fig.1.)

there also exists the topological vortex state in this broken phase of the maxwell

chern-simons higgs system. however,

in the (p, q)5-brane conguration we can not

simply identify this vortex state with the d-string stretch between two fragments of the

d3-brane. from the sugra solution of the (p, q)5-brane, there is a non-trivial vev of

(p, q)5-brane r is also satised r  ls. in this limit, that is, the axion eld take a constant

which is the same tension as the d-string in the maxwell theory conguration. therefore

the vortex state near the (p, q)5-brane conguration is not only magnetically charged but

also electrically charged.

field theoretically, the chern-simons interaction gives the relation between electric

charge q and magnetic ux 

q = 

(4.9)

from the gauss law constraint. so the vortex solution carry both magnetic charge and

electric charge in the ratio of 1 to . this consequence exactly agree with the (, 1)-string

state around the (p, q)5-brane background.

symmetric phase

for the symmetric phase the vevs of the scaler elds are

q = eq = 0,

x3 = 4/.

(4.10)

(4.11)

this phase does not exist in the maxwell higgs system. and also there is no corresponding

conguration in the n=4 hanany-witten setup. however, in our case there exists another

possible vacuum conguration for  6= 0 due to the rotation of the 5-brane. if we want to

set  6= 0 we must shift the positions of the 5-branes each other along the x9-direction.

in general, the d3-brane suspended between the 5-branes prevents this motion. one of

settlements is the division of the d3-brane into two parts as we mentioned before. another

solution is that the d3-brane slide up along the x5-direction and is attached again on the

intersecting point of the ns5-brane and the rotated (p, q)5-brane in the (x5, x9)-plane.

(see fig. 2.)

in this symmetric phase conguration, the position of the d3-brane in the x5 coordi-

nate is x5 = ed/ tan  where ed is a gap of the 5-brane positions. the gap ed corresponds to

the fi parameter  as in eq. (4.3) and the x5 position of the d3-brane corresponds to the

vev of the adjoint scalar x3. so we nd that the adjoint scalar vev is given by

x3 =

this result is exactly agree with (4.11).

moreover, the distance between the d3 and d5-brane is ed/ tan . this means that the

mass of the matter superelds which is coming from the fundamental string between d3

and d5-brane is 4/. correspondingly, when the x3 eld has the vev (4.11) the scalar

potential (4.4) gives the mass 4/ to the q and eq. this is also consistent with the brane

picture.

finally, we would like to comment on vortex states in this phase. in this symmetric

phase, it is known that there exists a non-topological vortex [16, 17]. since charges of the

non-topological vortex contain a continuous parameter, it seems to be dicult to nd the

corresponding state in string theory.
