abstract

we present a general description of two mixed branes interactions. for this we

consider two mixed branes with dimensions p1 and p2, in external eld b and arbi-
trary gauge elds a(1)

2 on the world volume of them, in spacetime in which

1 and a(2)

some of its directions are compactied on circles with dierent radii. some examples

are considered to clear these general interactions. finally contribution of the massless

states on the interactions is extracted. closed string with mixed boundary conditions

and boundary state formalism, provide useful tools for calculation of these interactions.

1 introduction

a way of describing d-branes is boundary state formalism [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. the boundary

state can be interpreted as a source for a closed string emitted by a d-brane. thus the

interaction of two d-branes is viewed as an exchange of closed string states, therefore it is

computed with a tree level diagram in which two boundary states are connected by means

of a closed string propagator.

by introducing back-ground elds b and a a u(1) gauge eld (which lives in the
d-brane) in the string -model one obtains mixed boundary conditions for string, these

elds appear in the boundary states and modify the tensions of the branes. mixed boundary

state formalism enables us to consider the problems not easily accessible to the canonical

approach via open strings.

mixed boundary conditions have been used for studying properties of d-branes in back-

ground elds [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. in ref.[15],the interaction between d0 and
d6 branes with back-ground gauge elds has been discussed. in ref.[16] we applied mixed
boundary conditions for the closed bosonic string and studied the interactions of the branes

in spacetime with compactication on tori. inclusion of fermionic degrees of freedom is non

trivial and requires its own techniques. this is what we take on in this article.

we use the covariant formalism to extract the boundary states which now involve apart

from the bosonic and fermionic components, due to the covariance the ghosts and superghosts

elements. then we compute the interaction amplitude between two mixed branes with
arbitrary dimensions p1 and p2 and eld strengths f1 and f2 as a closed string tree level
diagram. then we proceed to study the above considerations when certain directions are

compactied. finally to elucidate our general computations we apply our results to special

cases. it is worth emphasizing that part of these special cases are either inaccessible to the

canonical methods and the other part are very dicult to handle by canonical formulation.

among the special cases that will be considered is the parallel mp1 and mp2-branes with the
same total eld strength. the ns  ns sector interaction for p2  p1 = 4 vanishes, also for
p1 = p2 the total interaction vanishes. other examples include dierent internal elds are
: parallel m1  m1 , perpendicular m1  m1, m2  m0, parallel m2  m2, perpendicular
m2  m2 and parallel m5  m1 branes. they are considered to clear more properties of the
eld strengths and compactication eects on interaction amplitude. finally contribution

of the massless states on the amplitude for the ns-ns and r-r sectors separately will be

obtained.

in this article we denote a mixed brane with dimension p by notation mp-

brane.

2 boundary state

first we develop the boundary state formalism for the branes with background gauge elds.

deriving the boundary conditions from a -model action, we turn them in to boundary state

equations which we will solve in the next subsection.

2.1 boundary state equations

a -model action with b eld and two boundary terms [17] corresponding to the two mp1
and mp2-branes gauge elds is

where  is the world sheet of closed string exchanged between the branes and ()1 and
()2 are two boundaries of the world sheet. the rst boundary is at  = 0 and the
second at  = 0. the two u(1) gauge elds a(1)
live in mp1 and mp2-branes
respectively. 1, 1  {0, 1, ..., p1}, this set shows directions along the mp1-brane and {i1}
show directions perpendicular to it. likely 2, 2  {0, 1, ..., p2} and {i2} for mp2-brane.
g and b are usual back-ground elds. let b(x) and g(x) be constant elds.
variation of this action with respect to x (,  ) gives the boundary state equations and
equation of motion of x (,  ). using the convention 01 = 10 = 1, we obtain

where l is zero for non compact directions. for compact directions we have l = n r
and p = m 
r , in which n  is the winding number and m  is the momentum number of
closed string state, and r is the radius of compactication of x -direction. combining the
solution of the equation of motion and the boundary state equations we obtain

(10)

the boundary conditions on the fermionic degrees of freedom should be imposed on both
r r and ns  ns sectors. world sheet supersymmetry requires the two sectors to satisfy
the boundary conditions,

(11)

(12)

where 2 = 1 is the phase used to make gso projection easily. these states preserve half
of the world sheet supersymmetry. expanding the fermions in fourier modes the boundary

conditions become

where the index k is integer in the r-r sector and half-integer in the ns-ns sector. the

matrix q2 is

q2  (1  f2)1(1 + f2) ,

(15)

since f2 is antisymmetric , q2 is an orthogonal matrix. since we use the covariant formalism
we shall introduce ghost for the bosonic and fermionic gauge (reparametrization ) degrees of

freedom. let the ghost coordinates be b(,  ) and c(,  ). vanishing of the variation of the

ghosts action gives the ghosts boundary conditions. therefore the ghost modes satisfy the

following boundary conditions

(cid:18)bn e2in0  bn e2in0(cid:19) | b2

gh, 0i = 0 ,

(cid:18)cn e2in0 + cn e2in0(cid:19) | b2

gh, 0i = 0 ,

(16)

(17)

where n is non zero integer. the same consideration also determine the boundary conditions
for superghost coordinates , ,,

(cid:18)k + i2 k e4ik0(cid:19) | b2

sgh, 2, 0i = 0 .

(18)

(19)

the index k as previous is integer in the r-r sector and half-integer in the ns-ns sector.

2.2 solutions of boundary state equations

to nd the boundary states we shall proceed to solve the equations 6-10, 13-14 and 16-19.

equations (6-10) have the solution,

| b2

x, 0i = x{p2 } | b2

x, 0, p0, p 1, ..., p p2i ,

x, 0, p0, p

(20)

(21)

(22)

and tp2 is a constant depending on the tension of mp2-brane [3, 6]. the overall factor
qdet(1  f2) is expected by the path integral with boundary action [13, 18]. in (20) the
summation over {p2} can change to a sum over winding numbers {n 2c} due to the equation
(6) which implies

p2 = 

1

 x2c

f 2

(2) 2c

2c

,

(23)

where 2c = n 2cr2c and 2c shows the direction along mp2-brane which is compact. this
relation implies that the closed string state can have non zero momentum along the world

brane if there are non zero back-ground internal gauge elds and at least one of the brane

directions is compact. this relation correlates the momentum of closed string state along

the brane directions to its winding numbers. for compact directions of the brane, the closed
string state also has momentum numbers {m 2c}, therefore when 2 in (23) refers to the
compact directions of brane, we have

m 2c
r2c

= 

1

 x2c

f 2c

(2) 2c

r2cn 2c

,

(24)

this is a relation between momentum numbers and winding numbers of a given closed string

state, more details can be found in [16] where the pure bosonic case is discussed.

ghost part of boundary state has the form

| q = 1i | q = 1i ,

(25)

let us denote the fermionic modes in the r-r sector with d
n and in the ns-ns sector with
b
r , therefore the fermionic and the superghost parts of the ns-ns sector boundary state in
the (1,1) picture is

(27)

the fermionic and the superghost parts of the r-r sector boundary state in the (1/2,3/2)
picture is

where the superghost vacuum is in the (1/2,3/2) picture and is annihilated by 0 and
0 [19] and | b2
r is the fermionic zero mode boundary state. appearance of the
determinant in the denominator is the consequence of the path integral over the fermions

, 2i(0)

with fermionic boundary term. comparison of (21) and (28) implies that in the r-r sector

the normalizing determinant factors of the bosonic boundary determinant and its fermionic

partner cancel. however this factor remains in the ns-ns sector.

we now derive the explicit form of | b2

, 2i(0)
obeys the equations (13) and (14) with k = 0, i.e.

r both in type iia and type iib theories. it

| ai | bi = lim

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

where sa and sb are the spin elds in the 32-dimensional majorana representation. we use
a chiral representation for the 32  32 -matrices of so(1,9) as in reference [6]. also the
n on the state | ai | bi are given in [6], therefore
action of the ramond oscillators d

n and d

we consider solution of (32) of the form (like [7]),

| b2

, 2i(0)

r = m(2)

ab | ai | bi ,

therefore the 32  32 matrix m(2) satises the following equation

()tm(2)  i2s

(2) 11m(2) = 0 .

for this equation we consider a solution with the form

m(2) = c0 1... p2(cid:18)1 + i211

1 + i2 (cid:19)g2 ,

(34)

(35)

(36)

where c is the charge conjugation matrix and is show the space directions of the mp2-brane
world volume. for the case of f2 = 0, g2 must be equal to the unit matrix, in this case (36)

7

reduces to the equation (2.22) of [7]. from (35) and (36) we see that g2 must satisfy the
equation

g2 = q

(2)  g2

,

,   {0, 1, ..., p2} .

therefore matrix g2 has the solution with the conventional form

g2 = e

1
2 (f2) 

,

(37)

(38)

indeed one must expand the exponential with the convention that all gamma matrices anti

commute, therefore there are a nite number of terms. this convention is in ref.[11, 13].
for example for mp-brane with p = 1 along x 1, p = 2 along (x 1, x 2) and p = 3 along
(x 1, x 2, x 3) directions, respectively we have

g2 = 1 + f(2)0101 ,

g2 = 1 + f(2)0101 + f(2)0202 + f(2)1212 ,

g2 = 1 +

1
2f(2) + (f(2)01f(2)23  f(2)02f(2)13 + f(2)03f(2)12)0123 ,

(39)

(40)

(41)

and ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3.

this special representation of -matrices allow us to decompose the spinors in chiral and

anti-chiral components (a = (, )) with sixteen dimensional indices  and . in the type
iia theory p2 is even, therefore m(2) is a block-diagonal matrix, whereas in the type iib
theory p2 is odd and therefore m(2) is in the form of an o diagonal matrix with matrices
as its elements. thus in the sixteen-dimensional notation, | b2

r becomes

, 2i(0)
r = m | i1/2 | i3/2  i2m   | i1/2 | i3/2

| b2

, 2i(0)

2.3 gso projection of the boundary state

for both ns-ns and r-r sectors the complete boundary state can be written as the following

product

| b2, 2, 0ir,n s = | b2

x, 0i | b2

gh, 0i | b2

, 2, 0ir,n s | b2

sgh, 2, 0ir,n s .

the projected boundary state in the ns-ns sector is [7]
1  (1) f + g

1  (1)f +g

| b2, 0in s =

2

2

| b2, +, 0in s ,

where f and g are

f =



xr=1/2

b
rbr



, g = 

(rr + rr) .

xr=1/2

similar denitions hold for f and g. therefore projected state becomes

| b2, 0in s =
in the r-r sector the projection is

1
2

(| b2, +, 0in s | b2,, 0in s ) .

| b2, 0ir =

1 + (1)p(1)f +g

2

1  (1) f + g

2

| b2, +, 0ir ,

where p is even for type iia and odd for type iib, and

(48)

(49)

(1)f = 11(1)p

m=1 d

mdm

, g = 00 



xm=1

(mm + mm) .

(50)

finally the projected state is

| b2, 0ir =

1
2

(| b2, +, 0ir+ | b2,, 0ir ) .

(51)

equation (48) and (51) are similar to the case in which f2 = 0.

3 mixed branes interaction

before calculation of the interaction amplitude, let us introduce some notations for the
positions of these two mixed branes. the set {i} shows indices for directions perpendicular
to the both of the branes, {u} for the directions along the both of them, {
1} for directions
along mp1 and perpendicular to the mp2 and {
2} for directions along mp2 and perpendicular
2}, {1} = {u}s{
to the mp1 -branes. it can be seen that for example {i1} = {i}s{
1}.

3.1 the amplitude for the ns-ns sector

for calculation of the amplitude we need to the conjugate form of the boundary states. in

the ns-ns sector there are

(52)

(53)

the two mixed branes simply interact via exchange of closed strings, and the amplitude is

a = hb1 | d | b2, 0 = 0i ,

(54)

where d is closed string propagator and one must use the gso projected boundary states.

the ns-ns sector amplitude becomes

we see that the signs of  and   depend on the arrangements of is (and is) in their
arguments, therefore the r-r forces may be repulsive or attractive due to the brane-brane or
brane-antibrane interaction. because of our special regularization, the quantity   is usually
zero. due to their procedure, authors of ref.[7], have non-zero   for d0  d8 system.
some special congurations have non zero  , for example consider m2 and m8-branes along
(x 1, x 9) and (x 1, ..., x 8) directions respectively, then

(2) ucf

(76)

this result also hold for m3 and m7-branes along (x 1, x 8, x 9) and (x 1, ..., x 7) directions.
comparison of (55) and (72) says that the eects of compactication in an sn s and
in arr are the same. this is due to the fact that upon compactication only bosonic
contribution is modied. when these results are used in case of parallel mixed branes with
the same dimension, those terms which contain

3.3 a special case

now we consider the important example of parallel branes with the same f . consider
two parallel mp1 and mp2-branes which their world-branes are at (x 0, x 1, ..., x p1) and
(x 0, x 1, ..., x p1, ..., x p2) respectively with   p2  p1  0. also consider f(1) uv = f(2) uv 
fuv for u, v  {0, 1, ..., p1} and all other components of f2 be zero, therefore orthogonality
of q(1) uv(= q(2) uv) gives

det(1 + s1st

2 qn) = (1 + qn)10(1  qn) ,

(78)

where qn = q2n,q2n1. also equality of the eld strengths implies g1 = g2  g, therefore
(79)

,0tr(gc 1gt c) = 16,0 det(1  f ) ,

 =

the last equality can be investigated for each p1 individually. for this special conguration
equality of the eld strengths implies   = 0. finally the total amplitude a = an sn s +
arr becomes

therefore the tensions are modied by the factor qdet(1  f ). apart from the modication
of the tensions, eld strengths f appear in this interaction amplitude only through the
compactication eects. the rst two terms come from the ns-ns sector, for  = p2p1 = 4
the ns-ns sector amplitude vanishes. the third term comes from the r-r sector, and show
that the amplitude of the r-r sector for the branes of dierent dimensions ( 6= 0) vanishes.
for  = 0, total amplitude a vanishes (due to the abstruse identity) so the bps no force
condition is satised.
in non-compact spacetime, making a transformation t  /2t and for tp = (42)(3p)/2

the last zero amplitude transforms to the known parallel dp-branes amplitude [20] with the
expected extra factor,

in this part we give the interaction amplitude of the following special systems.

in these

systems back-ground elds and eects of the compactication appear more explicitly. these
systems are : parallel m1  m1-branes along x 1, m1-brane along x 1 perpendicular to m1
along x 2, m0-brane in front of m2-brane along x 1x 2, parallel m2  m2-branes along x 1x 2,
m2-brane along x 1x 2 perpendicular to m2-brane along x 2x 3, m1-brane along x 1 parallel
to m5-brane along x 1...x 5 directions. for all these we give the following amplitude

now we give the functions (f ,f , t, r, y) and w(f ,f , qn) for these systems, therefore

more properties of the interaction of these systems will become clear.

for this system we have

(e, e, t, r1) =

2
l



xm=

[(e  e)mr1/]et(1ee )m2r2

(83)

where r1 is the radius of compactication of x 1, therefore v2 = (2r1)l. also q is given
by the matrix

q =

and q has the same form as q in which e is replaced by e. we also have,

w(e, e, qn) = det(1 + qnqqt ) .

note that to get qt from q, one must use of

(qt )

 = (q)

therefore

w(e, e, qn) = (cid:18)1 +

for e = e we have

therefore through the compactication, elds e = e appear in the amplitude as in (88)

amplitude vanishes (due to the abstruse identity).

where q is the same as in (84). after the expansion of the determinant we see that the

system z = ee, therefore r-r interaction may be attractive, repulsive or zero, according
to the signs and values of e and e. we remind that the function w simplies to,

w(e, 0, qn) = (1  qn)2(1 + qn) .

for this system the functions  and w are

(f ,f , t, r) = 1 ,

is symmetric under the exchange of the e1 and e2 as expected. also z = b says that the
r-r interaction is attractive for positive f12 = b and is repulsive for negative b, in other
word r-r force depends on the fact that m0-brane is in what sides of m2-brane.

3.5 massless states contribution to the amplitude

for distant branes only massless states have a considerable contribution on the interaction

amplitude . as ns-ns sector and r-r sector massless states have zero momentum numbers
and winding numbers, in equations (55) and (72), only the term with n uc = 0 ( for all uc )
contributes to these states. in addition we must calculate the following limit

4 conclusion

we explicitly showed that how the total eld strength f and compactication eects appear
in the boundary states. a novel feature is to cause closed string states to have a momentum

along the brane, where the branes are wrapped on the compact directions.

we obtained the general form of the amplitude for branes with arbitrary dimensions
p1, p2 and internal eld strengths f1 and f2 for both compact and non-compact spaces.
the sign of the zero mode part of r-r sector amplitude  and   corresponds to the brane-

brane (antibrane-antibrane) or brane-antibrane interactions. for parallel mixed branes with

the same total eld strength, only in the compactied space the eld strength appears in

the interaction amplitude (except for the factors qdet(1  f ) in the modication of the
tensions). for this system when p2  p1 = 4, the ns-ns interaction vanishes, for p1 = p2
total interaction amplitude is zero, so the bps no force condition is satised.
