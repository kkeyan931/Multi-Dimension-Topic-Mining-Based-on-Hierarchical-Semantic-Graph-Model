abstract

equivalence in physics is discussed on the basis of experimental data accompa-
nied by experimental errors. the introduction of the equivalence being consistent
with the mathematical denition is possible only in theories constructed on non-
standard number spaces by taking the experimental errors as innitesimal numbers
of the non-standard spaces. following the idea for the equivalence (the physical
equivalence), a new description of space-time in terms of innitesimal-lattice points
on non-standard real number space r is proposed. the innitesimal-lattice space,
l, is represented by the set of points on r which are written by ln = n , where
the innitesimal lattice-spacing  is determined by a non-standard natural number
n such that   n 1. by using innitesimal neighborhoos (mon(r| l)) of real
number r on l we can make a space m which is isomorphic to r as additive
group. therefore, every point on ( m)n automatically has the internal conned-
subspace mon(r| l). a eld theory on l is proposed. to determine a projection
from l to m, a fundamental principle based on the physical equivalence is in-
troduced. the physical equivalence is expressed by the totally equal treatment for
indistinguishable quantities in our observations. following the principle, we show
that u (1) and su (n ) symmetries on the space ( m)n are induced from the in-
ternal substructure (mon(r| l))n . quantized state describing conguration space
is constructed on ( m)n . by providing that the subspace (mon(r| l))n is local
inertial system of general relativity, innitesimal distance operators are consistently
introduced. we see that lorentz and general relativistic transformations are also
represented by operators which involve the u (1) and su (n ) internal symmetries.

1. introduction

why are non-standard spaces needed in theories of physics?

for our recognition derived from observations the judgment of equivalence between

two or more phenomena plays a very important role. it is kown that the equivalence is

rigorously dened in mathematics in terms of the following three conditions;

(1) a  a (reection)

(2) a  b = b  a, (symmetry)

(3) a  b, b  c = a  c. (transitivity)

in observations of physics, that is, in experiments, the equivalence (physical equivalence)

can be described as follows:

two phenomena a and b are equivalent,

if a and b coincide within the experimental errors.

it should be stressed that the physical equivalence is detemined by the experimental errors.

futhermore we must recognize that there is no experiments accompanied by no error. we

should consider that experimental errors are one of the fundamental observables in our

experiments. it is quite hard to understand that there is no theory which involves any

description of experimental errors, even though they are very fundamental observables.

it is also hard to understand that the question whether such physical equivalence is

compatible with the mathematical denition represented by the above three conditions

had never been discussed. let us discuss the question here. we easily see that the rst two

conditions, that is, reection and symmetry are compatible with the physical equivalence

based on experimental errors. we can, however, easily present examples which break the

third condition (transitivity), that is to say, a  b and b  c are satised within their

errors but a and c does not coincide within their errors. this arises from the fact that

real numbers which exceed any real numbers can be made from repeated additions of a

non-zero real number because of archimedian property of real number space.

2

how can we introduce the physical equivalence in theories?

consistent denition of the physical equivalence is allowed, only when experimental errors

are taken as innitesimal numbers[1] in non-standard spaces. this result comes from the

fact that any non-zero real numbers cannot be made from any nite sum of innitesimal

numbers. any repetitions of the transitivity, that is, repeated additions of any innitesi-

mal numbers does not lead any non-zero real numbers. we can describe the situation as

follows;

  mon(0) and n  n = n  mon(0),

where mon(0) and n , respectively, stand for the set of all innitesimal numbers on

non-standard spaces and the set of all natural numbers. from the above argument we

can conclude that we must make theories, in which the physical equivalence based on

experimental errors is described in terms of the mathematically consistent form, on a non-

standard space. this is the reason why non-standard spaces are needed in the description

of realistic theories based on the physical equivalence. it is once more stressed that such

realistic theories must involve the fundamental observables, experimental errors, in the

mathematically rigorous way.

an example for the introduction of the physical equivalence in quantum mechanics on

non-standard space has been presented in the derivation of decoherence between quan-

tum states for the description of quantum theory of measurements.[2-4] in the theory

not only the decoherence required for the wave function collapse but also that for mi-

crocanonical ensembles of statistical mechanics (principle of a priori equal probabilities)

have been simultaneously derived by the realization of the physical equivalence. though

we have many other interesting problems for the construction of theories on non-standard

spaces,[5-12] we shall investigate space-time structure and eld theory,[11,12] following

the idea of the physical equivalence based on experimental errors, in this paper.

to help to see contents of this paper, we present a list of sections here:

12. concluding remarks

2. on observation of continuity of space-time

space-time structure has been studied as one of exciting theme in physics. whether

space-time is continuous (as represented by the set of real numbers r) or discrete (as

represented by the set of discrete lattice-points) is a fundamental question for the space-

time structure. we may ask

how can we experimentally verify the continuous property of space-time?.

as noted in the rst section, we have no experiment accompanied by no error. taking

into account that experimental errors are fundamental observables in physical phenom-

ena, we should understand that the continuity of space-time cannot be directly veried in

any experiments. this means that a discrete space-time is sucient to describe realistic

space-time. we, however, know that translational and rotational invariances (including

lorenz invariance) with respect to space-time axes seems to be very fundamental con-

cepts in nature and lattice spaces break them. this disadvantage seem to be very dicult

to overcome on usual lattice spaces having a nite lattice-spacing between two neigh-

4

boring lattice-points. as was discussed in the introduction, experimental errors must be

described in terms of innitesimal numbers on non-standard spaces. on non-standard

spaces[1] we can introduce innitesimal lengths which are smaller than all real numbers

except 0. it will be an interesting question whether we can overcome the disadvantage

on lattice spaces dened by innitesimal lattice-spacing. actually such innitesimal dis-

creteness cannot be observed in our experiments, where all results must be described by

real numbers. this fact indicates that such lattice space-time will possibly be observed as

continuous structure. hereafter we call lattice spaces discretized by innitesimal numbers

innitesimal-lattice spaces and they are denoted by l.[11] that is to say, such a lattice

space l is constructed as the set of non-standard numbers which are separated by an

innitesimal lattice-spacing  on r(the non-standard extension of r). lattice-points

on l are dened by

ln = n ,

for n  n

where n stands for the non-standard extension of the set of natural numbers n (=0, 1,

2, 3,   ) and consists of all natural numbers and non-standard natural numbers which

are innity. it is transparent that such l do not contain many of real numbers. there

is, however, a possibility that parts of innitesimal neighborhoods of all real numbers are

contained in l, because it is known that the power of

l is same as that of r.[1] if

it is true, there is a posibility that a space constructed from the set of all innitesimal

neighborhoods on l will be isomorphic to r and translations and rotations on the

space can be introduced as same as those on r.[11] in this paper we shall start from the

investigation of properties of

l and examine the construction of a new theory on the

space-time represented by l. if we can succeed it, we shall construct a eld theory on

the new space.[12]

3. short review of some fundamentals of non-standard space

here we shall briey review some fundamental languages of non-standard analysis,[1]

5

which are not familiar to physicists but needed in the argument of this paper. readers

who are familiar to non-standard analysis may skip this section and go to the next section.

(i) free ultra-lters

the set of real numbers r can be extended to the set of numbers (r) containing in-

nitesimal and innity in terms of free ultra-lters(f ) over n (n = (0, 1, 2, ....) denotes

the set of natural numbers). the free ultra-lters satisfy the following properties:

(a) n  f , (empty set)6 f ,

(b) a, b  f = a  b  f ,

(c) a  f , a  b = b  f ,

(d) f contains no nite set, (the lter having this property is called free),

(e) either e  f or n  e  f for e  n (the lter having this property is called

ultra-lter over n ).

hereafter lters and ultra-lters always mean free ultra-lters.

(ii) equivalence in terms of free ultra-lter and non-standard extension

we can construct the non-standard extension of r by introducing an equivalence relation

on sequences in rn by means of an ultra-lter f . the equivalence relation, f , is dened

as follows;

f f g

(1)

if and only if {n  n |f (n) = g(n)}  f , where f and g are, respectively, represented by

ultra-product

note that the sequences associated with the equivalence relation may be expressed by

f (n),

f = ynn

g(n).

g = ynn

(2)

using ultra-powers

f (n)/ f .

yn n

6

(3)

we may write the non-standard extension of r in terms of the quotient space

r = rn / f .

(4)

we also have non-standard extensions of n , z(the set of integers), q(the set of rational

numbers), c( the set of complex number) and so on, which are denoted as n , z, q,

c and so forth, respectively.

it is shown that r  r and the magnitudes of the

non-standard natural numbers, n  n  n , are innity.

(iii) denitions of , + and 

we can introduce the order  between two ultra-products f and g as follows;

if and only if {n  n |f (n)  g(n)}  f ,

f  g.

it is shown that n , z, q and r are totally ordered sets.

sum and multiplication are dened by

f + g = ynn

(f (n) + g(n)),

f  g = ynn

(f (n)  g(n)).

an example of n  n is given by using the ultra-product

n = ynn

(n + 1).

(5)

(6)

(7)

following the order  dened by free ultra-lters f and the properties (d) and (e) of f ,

it is obvious that

n > n,

for n  n

(8)

because the set {n  n |n + 1  n} 6 f is a nite set on n , whereas that of {n 

n |n + 1 > n}  f is an innite set on n .

(iv) standard part map(st-map)

7

we have a projection of every nite number(r) of r to a unique element(r) of r, which

is called as the standard part map(st-map) and written by

st(r) = r.

(9)

all innitesimal numbers are mapped at zero.

(v) monad of r  r (mon(r))

each real number r  r has its own innitesimal neighborhood mon(r) which is called

monad of r and dened by the set of r  r satisfying

st(r  r) = 0.

(10)

in other words it may be represented by the set of r  r satisfying st(r) = r. we

see that mon(0) contains all innitesimals. note that the map of all elements being nite

into monads of real numbers is unique, that is, no element of

r cannot belong two or

more monads simultaneously such that

mon(r)  mon(r) = ,

for r 6= r andr, r  r.

(vi) powers of

n and r

powers of

n and r are same as that of r, that is,

continuous power as that of r. in fact

n and r have the same
rr/mon(0) = r as eld is shown,[1] where

rr is the set of elements of

r, of which elements r are satised by the relation

st(r)  r.

4. innitesimal-lattice spaces l

let us take a non-standard natural number

n  n  n ,

(11)

8

which is an innity.[1] we take the closed set [ n/2, n/2] on r and put ( n)2 + 1

points with an equal spacing  = n 1 on the set. for the convenience of the following

discussions n is chosen as n/2  n . the length between two neighboring points is

 which is an innitesimal, i.e.

 mon(0). let us consider the set of the innitesimal

lattice-points l,[11] which consists of these ( n)2 + 1 discrete points on the closed

set. lattice-points on l are written by

ln = n ,

where n  z and full the relation

 ( n)2/2  n  ( n)2/2.

we put two end points as the same point, i.e.

l( n )2/2 = n = l( n )2/2 =  n.

(12)

(13)

(14)

this choice corresponds to the choice of periodic boundary which is required for the

introduction of translations on l. we may consider

l as the set of ( n)2 points

with the equal spacing  on the circle of the radius n/2. from the process of the

construction of l it is transparent that

l 6 r.

(15)

actually it is obvious that all irrational numbers of r are not contained in l, because

n is taken as an element of n and n  = n/ n is an element of z.

let us show a theorem:

monads of all real numbers, mon(r) r  r, have their elements on l.

proof: take a real number r  r. the number r is contained in the closed set

[ n/2, n/2] on r, because n is an innity of n and then [ n/2, n/2]  r.

since the lattice-points of l divide the closed set into (n)2 regions of which lenght is

, the real number r must be on a lattice-point or between two neighboring lattice-points

9

whose distance is . we can, therefore, nd out a non-standard integer nr fullling the

following relation;

nr

  r < (nr + 1) ,

(16)

where |nr|  n  n . the dierence r  nr

 is an innitesimal number smaller than

. thus we can dene the innitesimal neighborhood of r on l such that

mon(r| l)  {ln(r) = (nr + n) |n  z, n   mon(0)}.

(17)

the relation

st(ln(r)) = r

(18)

is obvious. the theorem has been proved. hereafter we shall call mon(r| l) and its

elements ln(r) monad lattice-space ( l-monad) and monad lattice-points, respectively.

from the above argument we see that there is one-to-one correspondence between r

and

ll(r)  {l0(r)|r  r}

(the set of l0(r) for r  r) with respect to the correspondence r  l0(r). note also that

from the denition of monad we have the relations

mon(r| l)  mon(r| l) = ,

for r 6= r, r, r  r.

(19)

magnitudes of lattice-points contained in all of the monad lattice-space mon(r| l)

for r  r are not innity, because they are elements of monads of real numbers. we

shall write the set of all these nite lattice-pionts by

lr  {ln(r)|r  r, n  z, n   mon(0)} = rr mon(r| l).

the sets

lr and mon(0| l) are additive groups. note here that

ll(r) is not an

additive group, because in general l0(r) + l0(r) 6= l0(r + r) possibly happens, that is,

nr+r is not always equal to nr + nr but possibly equal to nr + nr + 1.(see the denition

of nr given in (16).) it is apparent that

lr = ll(r) + mon(0| l) and ll(r)  mon(0| l) = {0}.

(20)

10

let us introduce the quotient set of lr by mon(0| l) as

m  lr/mon(0| l).

from one-to-one correspondence between r and ll(r) and the relations (20) we see that

there is one-to-one correspondence between r and m, and thus

m = r

(21)

as additive groups, where the addition on m may be described by st-map of the addition

on lr such that st(ln(r) + lm(r)) = r + r for ln(r)  mon(r| l) and lm(r) 

mon(r| l) with r, r  r.

we can construct the same quotient set where the zero point of the subset

lr is

taken at an arbitrary point of

l. that is to say, by using the relative distance ln m

between an arbitrary point lm and the origin ln as

ln m  lm  ln = (m  n) ,

(22)

we can proceed the same argument for constructing m. this means that l contains

innite number of subsets which are congruent to m. when we consider l on the circle

with the radius n/2 on r2, the angle of the sector including one m is innitesimal.

this means that m can be taken as a straight line on two dimensional real space r2,

even if it is put on the circle of r2.

finally we summarize the notations newly introduced in this section for the convie-

nience in the following discussions:

l =the set of all innitesimal lattice-points, (innitesimal latice-space)

mon(r| l)=the set of lattice points which are elements of mon(r) for r  r,

(monad lattice-space)

lr =the set of lattice-points which are elements of mon(r| l) for r  r,

(nite innitesimal lattice-space)

m = lr/mon(0| l), (observed space).

11

5. translations and rotations on m

since m = r as additive groups has been proved in the last section, it is obvious

that translations and rotations on m can be taken as same as those on r. we shall

here study translations and rotations on the sub-lattice space lr and construct them

on m explicitly.(see ref.11.)

5.1 translations

in general a translation  pm on l is represented by the following map from l to

l;

 pmln = ln+m,

for n, m  z.

the displacement length by this translation is

dm  ln+m  ln = lm = m .

let us study only nite translations restricted by

st(dm)  r.

(23)

(24)

(25)

note that the subset of l, i.e., lr, is mapped on to lr by these nite translations.

we may, therefore, consider that these nite translations represent translations on lr.

we also see that under these translations all the elements of mon(r| l) are replaced on

those of mon(r| l), where

r = st(r + dm).

(26)

let us show that the elements of mon(r| l) and those of mon(r| l) have one-to-one

correspondence. the displacement of mon(r| l) to mon(r| l) for r, r  r is described

by

drr = (nr  nr) ,

(27)

where nr

  r < (nr + 1)  and nr

  r < (nr + 1)  with nr, nr  z. it

is trivial that st(drr) = r  r is nite. an element of mon(r| l), lm(r) = (nr + m) ,

12

is replaced on an element of mon(r| l),

lm(r) = (nr + m) , by the translation.

considering the inverse of the translation, which is described by the displacement drr,

one-to-one correspondence between mon(r| l) and mon(r| l) is obvious.

we can change drr by innitesimal length dk = k  such that drr,k  drr + dk,

where k must be taken as integers of

z satisfying the relation k   mon(0). note

that dk does not depend on r and r. one-to-one correspondence is not aected by

these innitesimal changes. this fact means that all innitesimal translations( p0( lr))

described by dk are mapped on the zero translation on m. thus we see that all the

translations from mon(r| l) to mon(r| l) on lr, which produce the displacement

st(drr) on m, are expressed by

 pm( lr)   pm +  p0( lr),

(28)

where m = nr  nr. the quotient of the set of nite transrations({ pm( lr)}) on l

by  p0( lr),

{ pm( lr)}/ p0( lr),

represents translations on m, which corresponds to translations on r.

since translations in higher dimensinal spaces are trivial, we do not discuss it here.

5.2 rotations

let us study rotations on two dimensional spaces ( l)2, especially, rotations whose
center is put at the origin of ( l)2, i.e., ~l0(0) = (0, 0). a rotation in two dimensional real

space r2, of which center is at the origin, is represented by one parameter, i.e., a rotation

angle . under the rotation a point on r2 written by ~r = (rcos, rsin) is moved to

~r = (rcos( + ), rsin( + )), where r  r and 0  ,  < 2. the dierence between

the two vectors is

where

~r  ~r  ~d(~r) = (dx

 (~r), dy

(~r)),

dx
 (~r) = r(cos( + )  cos),

dy
(~r) = r(sin( + )  sin).

13

(29)

(30)

this means that the rotation of one point can be described by a displacement in the two
dimensional space expressed by ~d(~r) such that

r~r  ~r = ~r + ~d(~r).

(31)

we see that the rotation r for the rotation angle  in r2 can be described by a map
from r2 to r2 producing the displacement ~d(~r) for every vector ~r.

on two dimensinal innitesimal-lattice subspace ( lr)2, let us consider a map  r
which transfers all vectors on ( lr)2 to those on ( lr)2 such that a vector ~l0(~r) =
(l0(rcos), l0(rsin)) is transferred to ~l0(~r) = (l0(rcos( + )), l0(rsin( + ))). (l0(x) is

dened in (17).) the displacement vector produced by the map is given by

 r~l0(~r)  ~l0(~r)   ~d(~r) = ( dx

 (~r), dy

(~r)),

where

dx

 (~r) = n x

 (~r) ,

dy

(~r) = n y

 (~r) .

in (33) the integers n x

 (~r), n y

 (~r)  z must fulll the relations

n x

 (~r)   r(cos( + )  cos) < (n x

 (~r) + 1) ,

n y

 (~r)   r(sin( + )  sin) < (n y

 (~r) + 1) .

(32)

(33)

(34)

from one-to-one correspondence between mon(rcos| l) and mon(rcos( + )| l)

and that between mon(rsin| l) and mon(rsin( + )| l) with respect to the above

transfer (see the argument of 5.1), one-to-one correspondence between mon(~r| l) and

mon(~r| l) is self-evident, where mon(~r| l) is dened by the set of lattice-points

~r = ( x, y) satisfying the relations x  mon(rcos| l) and y  mon(rsin| l).
since the magnitude of ~r does not change under this map  r, i.e., |~r| = |~r|, all points
on ( lr)2 are mapped on ( lr)2. we may consider that these maps  r for   r

(0   < 2) represent rotations for real angles on ( lr)2, which correspond to the
rotations r on r2.

as was shown in 5.1, dx

 (~r) and dy

(~r) may be added by innitesimal displacements

as kx , ky   mon(0) for kx, ky  z. note that these innitesimal displacements do

14

not depend on vecotrs ~r. maps producing these innitesimal displacements represent no
rotation on ( m)2 and we write the set of these maps by  r0( lr). an arbitrary rotation
 r( lr) on ( lr)2 is represented by a map producing the displacement  ~d(~r) + ~d~k
with ~d~k = (kx , ky ) for each vector ~ln(~r). actually  r( lr) on ( lr)2, which
produce rotations for the xed angle   r on ( m)2, are expressed by the sum

 r( lr) =  r +  r0( lr),

where  r is dened in (32). thus the rotations on ( m)2 are represented by

{ r( lr)}/  r0( lr).

(35)

(36)

where { r( lr)} stands for the set of rotations  r( lr) on ( lr)2. it is obvious

that these rotations make a group.

the extension of these rotations to those in higher dimensional spaces is trivial.

6. conned fractal-like property of

l

we have shown that

m = r. we, however, know that there is a large dierence

between them, that is,

m is constructed from the monad lattice-spaces mon(r| l)

which contain innite number of dierent lattice-points on lr. in fact the power of

mon(r| l) can be not countable but continuous in general. let us study the structure

of mon(r| l) in more details. we can write the elements of mon(r| l) as

ln(r) = (nr + n) ,

(37)

where, even if nr is xed, n can be elements of

n  n , which satisfy the relation

n   mon(0). there are a lot of dierent possibilities depending on the choice of the

original non-standard natural number n  n  n . we shall here show two examples,

that is, one has an innite series of m and the other a nite series. (see ref.11.)

6.1 innite series of

m

15

dene an innite series of innite non-standard natural numbers by the following

ultra-products;

nm  ynn

(m )

n

,

for m  n

(38)

where (m )

n = 1 for 0  n  m and (m )

n = (n + 1)nm for n > m. following the
denition of the order > for ultra-products, we see that all of nm are innity and the

order is given by

n0 > n1 > n2 >    .

then we have an innite series of innitesimal numbers

0 < 1 < 2 <    ,

where m  (nm )1. we can also prove that ratios

m 

nm 1
nm

,

for m  1

(39)

(40)

(41)

are innities of n . since n0 is an element of natural numbers n  n , we can take

 = 0.

here let us consider the following rescaling for the lattice points;

ln(r)  l0(r) = n 0  1

1 l(1)
n ,

where

n = n 1.
l(1)

(42)

(43)

(44)

note that l(1)
n

is independent of r. even if the relation n 0  mon(0) must be satised,

the set of n  n satisfying the relation contains non-standard integers such that

m  m  n1  z,
n(1)

for m  z.

it is trivial that the relation is satised as

n(1)
m

0 = m1

1  mon(0).

16

(45)

(46)

it is also obvious that

n(1)
m

1 = m  z.

(47)

thus we can see that the set of l(1)
n ,

l(1)

r  {l(1)

n = n 1|n  z, n 0  mon(0)},

is an innitesimal-lattice space with the lattice-length 1.

in fact the set

l(1)

r is

constructed from the elements of mon(r| l) rescaled by the factor 1. from the facts
that l(1)

r contains all integers, archimedian property certies the existence of natural

numbers m  |r| for r  r and the distance between two neighboring lattice-points is

an innitesimal number

1, we can nd an element of

n  n , n (1)

r

, satisfying the

relation

n (1)

r

1  r(1) < (n (1)

r + 1) 1,

for r(1)  r.

(48)

following the same argument for the construction of m given in 4, we can introduce

the monad of r(1), mon(r(1)| l(1)

r ), by the set of the following lattice-points on l(1)
r ;

l(1)
n (r(1)) = (n (1)

r + n(1)) 1,

(49)

where n(1)  z and st(n(1) 1) = 0 must be fullled. it is obvious that mon(r(1)| l(1)
r )

contains an innite number of elements. now we can dene m(1) by the set

m(1)  l(1)

r /mon(0| l(1)

r ).

the relation

m(1) = m = r

(50)

(51)

as additive groups is obvious. thus translations and rotations on n-dimensional space

( m(1))n are described as same as those of ( m)n . we can conclude that every monad

lattice-space mon(r| l) for r  r contain the same space m(1) by means of the same

scale transformation.

the second rescaling by using n2 is carried out by following the same procedure

presented above. we can perform the second rescaling by

n  2(l(1)
l(2)

n (r(1))  l(1)

0 (r(1))),

(52)

17

the derivations of

l(2)

r and m(2)  l(2)

r /mon(0| l(2)

r ) are same as those given in

the previous argument, and then we have

m(2) = m(1) = m = r.

(53)

by using the innite series of nm we can proceed the same argument for the construction

of m(m ) and thus we obtain the innite series of sets isomorphic to r as additive group

such that

r = m = m(1) =    = m(m ) =    .

(54)

6.2 finite series of

m

we denite a nite series of innite numbers

n l

l  ynn

(n + 1)ll,

for l = 0, 1, 2,    , l  1

where n l

l  n  n . we also see that

l 

n l
l1
n l
l

= ynn

(n + 1)  n  n .

(55)

(56)

following the same argument as that of the innite series, we can construct a nite series

of sets isomorphic to r as additive group

r = m = m(1) =    = m(l1).

(57)

we have many dierent examples for deriving such series. note that mon(r| l) does

not have the structure discussed above, if n dened by (7) is taken, that is, the case for

l = 1 in the above argument.

from the above arguments we understand that the set of nite lattice-points on l,
i.e., lr contains series of spaces m(m ) = r, which are constructed by means of relevant

series of rescalings. thus we may say that lr has a property similar to so-called fractal

property. note that the scaling parameter n in the rescaling

m (r)  l(n)
l(n)

m (r) = n(l(n1)

m

(r)  l(n1)

m

(r)),

(58)

18

is innity. so the similarity between fractal property and the structure of

lr cannot

directly dene on r. we may consider that the innitesimal fractal-like property of

lr cannot directly be observed on m. this means that the innitesimal fractal-like

property is conned on m. note here that

l itself contains innite number of the

same sets as

lr. then we may say that

l itself has the innitesimal fractal-like

property.

7. construction of elds on m

let us construct elds on m. in the construction of eld theory on m we follow

the next two fundamental principles:[12]

(i) all denitions and evaluations should be carried out on the original space l.

(ii) in denitions of any kinds of physical quantities on m, all the elds contained in

the same monad lattice-space mon(r|l) should be treated equivalently.

(principle of

physical equivalece)

it should be noted that the principle (i) means that theories which we will make on l

is generally not the same as any extensions of standard theories which have been con-

structed on r. the principle (i) also tells us that all physical expectation values on r

are obtained by taking standard part maps (maps from r to r)[1] of results calculated

on l. the principle (ii) is considered as the realization of the equivalence for indis-

tinguishable quantities in quantum mechanics on non-standard space.[3] this principle,

principle of physical equivalence, determines projections of physical systems dened on

l to those dened on m. taking account of the fact that all points contained in the

same monad lattice-space mon(r|l) cannot be experimentally distinguished, the equiv-

alent treatment with respect to all quantities dened on these indistinguishable points is

a natural requirement in the construction of theories on m.

19

7.1 fields on l

let us dene two elds a(m) and a(m) on every lattice point r(m) on l, which

follow the commutation relations

[a(m), a(m)] = mm

and others = 0.

(59)

the vacuum |0 >= qm |0 >m and the dual vacuum < 0| = qm m < 0| are dened by

a(m)|0 >m= 0

and

m < 0| a(m) = 0

(60)

with m < 0|0 >m= 1. the elds a(m) and a(m) operate only on the vacuum |0 >m and
the dual vacuum m < 0|. following the principle (i), all expectation values are imposed

to be calculated on l such that

< 0| o({a}, { a})|0 >  r,

where o is operator constructed from the sets of the elds a(m) and a(m). physical

values are obtained by the standard part map as

st(< 0| o|0 >)  r.

7.2 fields on m

following principle of physical equivalence (principle (ii)), we dene elds at every

point on m as the following equivalent sum over all elds contained in mon(r|l);

([r])  xl
([r])  xl

a(nr + l)/sxl
a(nr + l)/sxl

1,

1,

(61)

where pl  pl,lmon(0) and hereafter [r] in ([r]) always means the fact that the
equivalent sum over mon(r|l) expressed by pl is carried out in the denition of ([r]).

here the equivalent sum is just the expression of principle of physical equivalence. we

20

can easily evaluate the commutation relation

[([r]), ([r])] = rr = 1 (for r = r),

= 0 (for r 6= r).

(62)

note that r, r  r but rr is not equal to the usual dirac delta function (r  r).

complex elds on m, which are represented by linear combinations certifying the same

weight for all elds contained in mon(r|l), are generally written by

eik

([r]; k) = xl
([r]; k) = xl

where

1,

l (r)a(nr + l)/sxl
l (r) a(nr + l)/sxl

eik

1,

(63)

with the constraint k  mon(0) for non-standard integers k. they satisfy the commu-

k

l (r) = k(r) + 2lk/ xl

1

tation relations

[([r]; k), ([r]; k)] = rrkk

and others = 0. these elds are the fourier components for the elds on mon(r|l)
and their component number is same as that of a(nr + l) and a(nr + l) included in

mon(r|l), because the constraint for k, that is, k  mon(0), is same as that for l.

note that ([r]) and ([r]) given in (61) correspond to the above elds with k = 0 and

0(r) = 0. experimentally the dierences of the wave numbers k are not observable,

because their wave lengths are innitesimal. it is stressed that elds on one point of m

have innite degrees of freedom. general elds on m are described by functions of these

elds such that

([r]) = f ({([r]; k)}, { ([r]; k)}).

(64)

7.3 extension to n-dimensional space

21

extension of the above consideration to n-dimensional space (m)n is trivial. note

that one should not confuse the n for the n-dimensions of the space with the nr for

the lattice number corresponding to r of r (see (16)) in the following discussions. every

point of (l)n is represented by a n-dimensional vector

~rn ( ~m)  (r1(m1), ....., rn (mn )),

where ri(mi) = (nri + li) with st(nri) = ri  r and li  mon(0) for i = 1, ....., n.
fields with n-components at ~rn ( ~m), aj( ~m) and ak( ~m) (j, k = 1, ...., n), are dened by

the following commutation relations;

[aj( ~m), ak( ~m)] = jk

n

yi=1

mim

i

(65)

for j, k = 1, ...., n and others = 0. we may consider that these n number of elds

describe the n oscillators of a lattice point corresponding to n dierent directions of the

space. the elds on (m)n are described as follows;

j([~rn u({(~rn ]; ~kn ) = xl1
and similar to j([~rn ]; ~k). we again have the commutation relations

l(s) (~rn )aj(nr1 + l1,   , nrn + ln )/(xl

   xln

eipn

s=1 k(s)

[j([~rn ]; ~kn ), l([~rn ]; ~kn )] = jl

and others = 0.

(67)

8. internal symmetries on ( m)n induced from the conned

substructure (mon(r| l))n

symmetries on (m)n which is induced from the internal substructure (mon(r|l))n

are expressed by transformations ut which keep all expectation values unchanged such

that

< 0| o({a}, { a})|0 >=< 0|u 1

t ut o({a}, { a})u 1

t ut |0 > .

22

in general the transformation ut will be represented by maps of elds aj( ~m) ( aj( ~m)) to a
linear combination of the elds ak( ~m) ( ak( ~m)) (k = 1,    , n) on l. if the operators ut

do not change the structure of ( m)n , they can represent symmetries on (mon(r| l))n .

8.1 transformation opertors on internal subspaces (mon(r| l))n

let us start from the construction of transformation operators on an internal subspace

contained in a point on (m)n corresponding to a point ~rn = (r1, ....., rn ) on rn .
the transformations map elds aj(~rn ( ~m)) ( aj(~rn ( ~m))) on every lattice-point (~rn ( ~m) =
n ) ( ak(nr1 +

(nr1 +l1, ..., nrn +ln )) to linear combinations of elds ak(nr1 +l
l
1, ..., nrn + l
principle of physical equivalence (principle (ii)), we construct the following n 2-number
of operators tjk([~rn ]) on ( m)n , which are again dened by the equivalent sum over all

n )) (k = 1, ..., n) on the lattice-points of the same subspace. following

1, ..., nrn +l

elds contained in the n-dimensional subspace (mon(r|l))n as

tjk([~rn ]) = xl1

   xln

aj(nr1 + l1, ..., nrn + ln )ak(nr1 + l1, ..., nrn + ln ).

(68)

we easily obtain commutation relations

[ tjk([~rn ]), al(~rn ( ~m))] = (

n

yi=1

rir

i

)jlak(~rn ( ~m)),

[ tjk([~rn ]), al(~rn ( ~m))] = (

rir

)kl aj(~rn ( ~m)),

rir

n

[ tjk([~rn ]), tlm([~rn ])] = (

these operators tjk can be recomposed into the following generators;

(1) u(1)-generator:

(2) su(n)-generators:

j0 =

tjj.

xj=1

jl =

j (1)
jk = tjk + tkj,

j (2)
jk =

( tjk  tkj),

1
i

(72)

for j 6= k.

for instance, we can represent them by well-known matrices including pauli spin matrices

~ for n = 2 case as

j0  1,

j1  3,

j (1)
12  1 and j (2)

12  2.

now it is trivial that operators given by

)}) = exp[i

xj=1

jk(~rn ) tjk([~rn ])]

(73)

with st( jk(~rn ))  c (the set of complex numbers) produce maps of all elds on

the subspace (mon(r| l))n to linear combinations of the elds on the same subspace.
from the construction procedure of tjk it is obvious that the operators do not break the

structure of ( m)n . note also that u does not change the vacuum and the dual vacuum,

because

 tjk|0 >=< 0| tjk = 0.

8.2 symmetries on ( m)n

operators on ( m)n can be dened by products of u((~rn )) as

ut ({}) =

n

yi=1

ynri

u({(~rn )}),

(74)

where qnri stand for the product with respect to nri with the constraint st( nri) =

nri given in (16).) it is interesting that the transfor-

ri  r . (see the denition of

mations produced by ut ({}) are generally local transformations on our observed space

(m)n because the parameters {} can depend on the position ~rn , whereas they are

global ones on the internal subspace (mon(r|l))n . note that ut does not change the

vacuum and the dual vacuum.

24

let us show a few realistic transformations included in ut .

(a) u(1) transformation:

u0(~rn ) = exp[i0(~rn ) j0([~rn ])]

(75)

for st(0)  r. it is an interesting problem to investigate whether this u(1) symmetry

can be the u(1) symmetry of electro-weak gauge theory or the solution of so-called u(1)

problem in hadron dynamics.

(b) su(n) transformation:

un (~rn ) = exp[i{

l(~rn ) jl([~rn ]) +

k1

xj=1

xk=2

xi=1

jk (~rn ) j (i)

jk ([~rn ])}]

(76)

for st(l), st((i)

jk )  r. it is an interesting proposal that three color components of

qcd may be identied by those of u3(~r3) for three spatial dimensions.

9. quantized conguration space and innitesimal distances

here we study conguration space describing m, which will be useful in the investi-

gations of general relativity and gravitaions.

9.1 quantization of conguration space

let us start from 1-dimensional space. we can construct position operator

r m = xnr

r tr,

(77)

where pnr stands for the sum over nr with the constraint st( nr) = r  r and

tr = xl

a(nr + l)a(nr + l).

(78)

following principle of physical equivqlence, tr is expressed by the equivalent sum with

respect to all elds in the same monad lattice-space mon(r| l). note that r in (77) can

be replaced by r + ar

 with the constant st(ar

) = 0 for r  r. the eigenstate of

25

r m for the eigenvalue r is written by

|r > m ([r])|0 > .

(79)

hereafter we call them monad states. the relation

r m|r > m= r|r > m

is trivial. if one does not want to have 0 eigenvalue for r = 0, r + ar

 can be used

instead of r in the denitoin of r m. the monad states |r > m are quite similar to the

ket states of usual quantum mechanics except the normalization condition

m < r|r > m= rr,

where m < r| =< 0| qnr ([r]). it is noted that every monad state |r > m has its

own internal substructure mon(r| l).

now we can dene the quantized states for our conguration space as follows;

| m > ynr

|r > m, < m|  ynr

m < r|.

(80)

on these states the position operator r m is represented by a diagonal operator and then

we can consider that the base state | m > describes our conguration space, which is

normalized as < m| m >= 1.

extension to n-dimension is trivial. a component of the position-vector operator can

be dened as same as that of the 1-dimensinal case, e.g., for the ith component

ri m = xnr1

    xnrn

ri ti([~rn ]),

(81)

where

ti([~rn ]) = xl1

   xln

ai(nr1 + l1, ..., nrn + ln )ai(nr1 + l1, ..., nrn + ln )

(82)

for i = 1, 2, ..., n. the n-dimensional conguration state is expressed by

| mn >=

n

(  ynr1
yj=1

    ynrn

26

j([~rn ]))|0 > .

(83)

9.2 innitesimal distance

innitesimal relative distance operators are denable only on the internal subspace

mon(r|l) such that

where l  l  l and

with the deniion

dr(l)  r(nr + l)  r(nr + l),

(84)

r(nr + k)  (nr + l) a([r])a(nr + k)

a([r])  xl

a(nr + l),

which follows princilpe of physical equivalnce. the monad states |r > m are the eigen-

states of r(nr + l) and dr(l). we actually obtain

dr(l)|r > m= l|r > m .

we can write squared distance operators in the n-dimensional space as

(ds)2(~rn ) = dr(~ln )gdr(~ln ),

where the sums over  and  from 1 to n are neglected,

(85)

(86)

dr(~ln ) = r(nr1 + l1, ..., nrn + ln )  r(nr1 + l

1, ..., nrn + l

n )

with r(nr1 + l1, ..., nrn + ln ) = (nr + l) a([~rn ])a(nr1 + l1, ..., nrn + ln ) and
~ln = (l1  l
n ). if the metric oprator g is taken as minkowski metric, the
internal subspace (mon(r|l))n just represents so-called local inertial system in general

1,   , ln  l

relativity. we have the equations

dr(~ln )|~rn > m = l|~rn > m,

(d~s)2(~rn )|~rn > = 2lgl|~rn > m .

(87)

27

the expectation value of (ds)2 is calculated as follows;

(ds)2 = m< ~rn |(ds)2(~rn )|~rn > m .

the same expectaton value of the squared distance operator can be obtained in terms of

the expectation value with respect to the conguration state | mn >. it is transparent

that transformations keeping (ds)2 unchanged are represented by u({(~rn )}) given in

(73).

10. translations, rotations and lorentz and general relativistic

transformations

let us study symmetries on the conguration space, which keep all expectation values

unchanged such that

< mn|u 1u o({ a}, {a})u 1u| mn > .

note that the conguration state | mn >, the dual state < mn | and operators are

transformed as follows;

| mn > u| mn >, < mn| < mn |u 1

, u o(....)u 1.

10.1 translational invariance on ( m)n

the operator which replaces |r > with |r +  > for   r is obtained as

pr() = xl

a(nr+ + l)a(nr + l).

we have pr()|0 >= 0. then we can dene the translation operator by

p () =: ynr

pr() :,

(88)

(89)

where : ...... : means the normal product used in usual eld theory, in which all creation
operators ( aj(m)) must put on the left-hand side of all annihilation operators (aj(m)).

28

we see that p () transforms the conguration state | m > to the isomorophic space,

that is,

for   r.

p ()| m >= | m >

(90)

let us study the invariance of expectation values

< m| o({ a}, {a})| m > .

taking account of the denitions of | m >= q ([r])| 0 > and < m| =< 0|q ([r])

and the fact that all the elds commute each other except a and a on the same lattice-

point, the number of a and that of a on the same lattice-point must be same in operators

having non-vanishing expectation values on | m >. this means that every term of such

operators must be written by the product of powers such as ( aa)n with n  n for all

pairs of a and a on the same lattice-point. on the other hand we easily see that the

products of aa on the same lattice-piont commute with p () such that

[ aa, p ()] = 0

(91)

for   r. now we can conclude that operators having non-vanishing expetation values

commute with the translation operators, that is,

[ o({ a}, {a}), p ()] = 0.

(92)

translational invariance is certied for physically meaningful operators as

< m| p () o(...) p ()| m > = < m| p () p () o(...)| m >

= < m| o(...)| m >

(93)

because of the relation < m| p () p () =< m|.

the extension of the above argument to the n-dimensional spaces is trivial. note also

that the translations cannot be generated by the operators ut given in (74).

10.2 rotations

29

rotational invariance can be introduced only for subspaces whose metric g have the

same sign like so(3) subspace of so(3, 1). generators for the rotations in (j, k)-plane

are given by

jjk = tjk  tkj.

in general rotation operators are described by

ur({}) = eip(j,k) jk

jjk.

(94)

(95)

it is transparent that ur for st(jk)  r are unitary operators and generate rotations

on the subspace.

10.3 lorentz transfomations

position operator for one point on ( m)n corresponding to ~rn on rn is given by

rj([~rn ]) = rj j([~rn ])j([~rn ]),

for j = 1, ..., n.

the expectation value of squared distance from the origin are evaluated as

(~rn )2 =< mn |r([~rn ])g r([~rn ])| mn >,

(96)

(97)

where the metric tensors g are taken as minkowski metric tensors.

let us study the simplest case for n = 2. the metric tensors are chosen such that

g11 = g22 = 1 and g12 = g21 = 0.

transformations

ul(a) =

n

yj=1

 ynrj

ea j (1)

12 ([~rn ])

(98)

with the constraint st(a)  r (see (73) and (74)) generate 2-dimensional lorentz trans-

formations which are expressed in 2-dimensional matrices as

ul(a) =   cosha

sinha

sinha

cosha !

30

generalization for the n-dimensions can be performed by using combinations of ul(a)

with the rotations.

10.4 general relativistic transformations

we have many dierent types of transformations which keep the squred distance (~rn )2

invariant but generally do not the metric tensors invariant, while lorentz transformations

keep both of them invariant. they are described by the transformations ut ({}) given

in (74), where the parameters {} should be chosen such that all the axes are real after

the translations. of course, all the parameters must be nite. in such transformations

we have dierent types of vectors corresponding to covariant and contravariant tensors in

general coordinate transformations. the dierence between them is expressed as follows;

ugr| mn >,

for covariant vectors

< mn |rgu 1
g ,

for contravariant vectors.

(99)

a simple example representing dilatation transformations are described by

dd = epn

j=1 aj (~rn ) tjj ([~rn ]),

(100)

which transforms as

ud r| mn >= ea(~rn )r| mn >,

< mn |rgu 1

d =< mn|rgea(~rn ).

note again that ug({(~rn )}) is global on the subspace (mon(r| l))n , even though it

is generally local on observed space ( m)n . we understand that all the transformations

described by ut of (74) can include general relativistic transformations. this fact implies

that general relativstivc transformations are generally represented by local non-abelian

transformations.

11. remarks on fermionic oscillators

31

in this section we shall comment that instead of bosonic elds a(m) and a(m) we can

construct similar eld theory by using fermionic elds c(m) and c(m) which satisfy an-
ticommutaion relations [c(m), c(m)]+ = 1 and commutation relations [c(m), c(m)] =
[c(m), c(m)] = [ c(m), c(m)] = 0 for m 6= m.

as far as operators tjk([~rn ]) presented in (68) are concerned, we can dene them by the
replacement of a and a with c and c, respectively. and we get the same commutation

relations given in (69). this means that all the arguments of the internal symmetries

performed in the bosonic oscillator case are completely accomplished in the fermionic

oscillator case. that is to say, as far as the internal symmetries are concerned, there

is no dierence between the bosonic and the fermionic cases. futhermore we can easily
understand that not only ut but also all other operators written by the products of a
and a like tr, r and pr can be dened in the replacement of a a with c c and they have

the same properties as discussed in the bosonic case.

dierence between them appears in the construction of realistic elds from ([r]; k).

namely products of more than the non-standard natural number pl 1 with respect to

the elds ([r]; k) vanish for the fermionic case, whereas there is no such restriction in the

bosonic case. we may say that the concept of antiparticles will be introduced more easily

in the fermionic case by using occupaton and unoccupation numbers of lattice-points of

the monad lattice-space mon(r| l).

anyhow the selection of the bosonic or the fermionic or both like supersymmetric is

still open question at present.

12. concluding remarks

we have constructed a eld thoery on the quantized space-time by using innitesimal-

lattice space ( l)n . in this scheme the internal subspace (mon(r|l))n and the symmety

transformation ut induced from the subspace are uniquely determined, when we construct
the eld theory on (m)n = rn . since all denitions and evaluations are imposed to be

32

done on ( l)n , we can perform them in terms of -nte sum in non-standard analysis.

in fact we need not introduce any dirac -functions. in this scheme we can carry out

all evaluations on conguration space, not on fock space in usual eld theory. this fact

is an interesting advantage in the investigation of quantum gravity, as was seen in the

introduction of the innitesimal relative distance and the local inertial system. in order

to investigate this model in more detail an inevitable problem is introducing equation of

motions on (m)n , which will be represented by dierence equation on mon(r|l). it is

also interesting to study relations between the general eld ([r]) and observed elds like

leptons, quarks, gauge elds and etc. to carry out these works we have to investigate the

symmetries described by ut more precisely.

finally i would like to present the global view of theory on non-standard space once

more. the fundamental concept is introducing the equivalence based on experimental

errors (physical equivalence) into theories in a mathematically consistent logic, which is

allowed only on non-standard spaces. on the spaces the physical equivalence determine

projections from non-standard spaces to observed spaces rn , which are described by lters

in non-standard theory. in fact the lters determine topologies, because they determine

the structure of the monad space and then that of the observed space.[1] this means that

we observe physical phenomena which depend on the errors, that is to say, we have to

answer the following questions to determine the worlds which we observe in experiments:

which quantities are taken as observables accompanied by errors in experiments?

how large are the errors?

we have to understand that in an experiment we are allowed to peep only through a lter

which is determined by the physical equivalence based on the errors of the experiment.

theories on observed spaces, which explain experimental results, of course have to depend

on the lters which determine the projections of the theory on the non-standard space to

theories on the observed spaces, even if the theory is uniqe on the non-standard space.

actually we have presented some dierent lters, for instance,

lters with h  mon(0) derives classical limits,[6,7]

33

lters with h  mon(0) but hn 6 mon(0) does macroscopic limit,[8,9]

lters with g(coupling of objects with heat baths)  mon(0) does microcanonical

ensembles of statistical mechanics.[2,3,4,10]

we see that those lters derive dierent monad spaces and then dierent observed spaces

(dierent theories). in any quantum mechanical systems experimental errors are mainly

determined by the characters of measurement apparatus, even though the erroes are

produced from the interactions between objects and apparatus. we have to determine

the lters in analyzing the schemes of the apparatus which produce the errors in the

experiments. here i would like again to repeat that we cannot perform any expriments

which are not accompanied by any errors. therefore we have always to take account of

phenomena hidden behind experimental errors, when we make theories in our observed

spaces.
