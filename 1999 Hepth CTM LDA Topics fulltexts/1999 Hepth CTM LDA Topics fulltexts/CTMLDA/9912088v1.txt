commuting hamiltonians from seiberg-witten -functions

a.mironov, a.morozov

elementary maple calculations are used to support the claim of hep-th/9906240 that

the ratios of theta-functions, associated with the seiberg-witten complex curves, provide

poisson-commuting hamiltonians which describe the dual of the original seiberg-witten

integrable system.

the goal of this note is to suggest a numerical evidence in favor of the manifest construction

proposed in [1] for the dual integrable systems [2, 3]. this construction allows one to build systems dual

to the elliptic calogero and ruijsenaars models with elliptic dependence on momenta and ultimately

leads to the (self-dual) double elliptic system describing 6d susy gauge theories with the adjoint

matter hypermultiplet. we start with repeating and discussing the main steps of the construction [1].

1. standard approach [4] to the seiberg-witten anzatz [5] is to associate with every theory an

integrable system s given by a lax operator l(~p, ~q|) that naturally gives rise to a family of the

spectral curves of genus g,

c :

det (l(~p, ~q|)  ) = 0

parametrized by the poisson-commuting hamiltonians (moduli) hn(~p, ~q), n = 1, . . . , g,

{hm, hn}

(2)

a distinguished set of the poisson-commuting quantities is provided by the at moduli (action

variables of the system s)

which are the a-periods of the presymplectic 1-form ds characterized by the property that its in-

nitesimal variations with respect to moduli is holomorphic on the curve c,

2. in [1] it was claimed that another interesting set of poisson-commuting quantities is provided by

the ratios of riemannian theta-functions (kp  -functions) associated with the curve c  and they

were interpreted as the hamiltonians of the dual integrable system.

in the case of gl(n ), n = g + 1 an explicit construction looks as follows. the spectral curve

of the original integrable system (toda chain, calogero, ruijsenaars or the most interesting double

elliptic system) has a period matrix tij(~a), i, j = 1, . . . , n with the special property:

tij(a) = , i

n

xj=1

(5)

where  does not depend on a. as a corollary, the genus-n theta-function is naturally decomposed

into a linear combination of genus-g theta-functions:

(n )(pi|tij) = xniz

(10)

(11)

the hamiltonians of the dual integrable system can be chosen in the form hk = k/0, k = 1, . . . , g.

3. this claim was partly supported by the old observation [8, 9] that zeroes of the kp (toda)  -

function (i.e. essentially the riemannian theta-function), associated with the spectral curve (1) are

nothing but the coordinates qi of the original (calodero, ruijsenaars) integrable system s. in more

detail, due to the property (5), (n )(p|t ) as a function of  = 1

i=1 pi is an elliptic function on the

n pn

2

torus (1,  ) and, therefore, can be decomposed into an n -fold product of the genus-one theta-functions.

remarkably, their arguments are just   qi:

(n )(p|t ) = c(p, t,  )

n

yi=1

(  qi(p, t )| )

(12)

(in the case of the toda chain when   i this sum rule is implied by the standard expression for

the individual eqi through the kp  -function.) since one can prove that qi form a poisson-commuting

set of variables with respect to the symplectic structure (8), this observation indirectly justies the

claim of ref.[1].

a deeper argument for the commutativity of such ratios should come from the study of (the

quasiclassical limit of) quantum  -functions and their properties [10] (i.e.

from group theory), but

this is beyond the scope of the present letter.

postponing discussion of deep theoretical origins of (9), we report here some results of maple

calculations, which provide a nontrivial check of those relations.

4.1. in the simplest case of the seiberg-witten family

w = pn () =

n

yi=1

(  i);

ds = d log w

(13)

the at moduli ai = i, the period matrix is singular and only nite number of terms survives in the

series for the theta-function:

n 1

(n )(p|t ) =

xk=0
k (p, a) = xi,[i]=kyii

h (0)

e2ikh (0)

k (p, a),

f (0)

ij (a)

e2ipi yj i

(14)

(15)

(16)

here

f (0)

ij (a) =


aij

and i are all possible partitions of n indices into the sets of k = [i] and n  k = [ i] elements.

parameter  becomes signicant only when the system is deformed: either non-perturbatively or to

more complex systems of the calogeroruijsenaarsdouble-elliptic family.

this is the case of perturbative 4d pure n = 2 sym theory with the prepotential

f (0)(a) =

1
2i

n

xi<j

a2
ij log aij

(17)

the corresponding  -function (n )(p|t ), eq.(14), describes an n -soliton solution to the kp hierarchy.
the hamiltonians h (0)

k , eq.(15), are those of the degenerated rational ruijsenaars system, and they

are well-known to poisson-commute with respect to the relevant seiberg-witten symplectic structure

(8).

3

the same construction for the other perturbative seiberg-witten systems ends up with the hamil-

tonians of the more sophisticated ruijsenaars systems.

for the spectral curves [11]

w =

pn ()

pn (  m)

i=1(  i)

i=1(  i  m)

= qn
qn

;

ds = d log w

(18)

(perturbative 4d n = 4 sym with susy softly broken down to n = 2 by the mass m) the poisson-
commuting (with respect to the same (8)) hamiltonians h (0)
k

are given by (15) with

ij (a) = qa2

f (0)

ij  m2
aij

(19)

i.e. are the hamiltonians of the rational ruijsenaars system.

for the spectral curve [11]

w = e2in pn ()

pn (e2i)

;

ds = log d log w

(20)

(perturbative 5d n = 2 sym compactied on a circle with an  twist as the boundary conditions) the

hamiltonians are given by (15) with

ij (a) = qsinh(aij + ) sinh(aij  )

f (0)

sinh aij

(21)

i.e. are the hamiltonians of the trigonometric ruijsenaars system.

finally, for the perturbative limit of the most interesting self-dual double-elliptic system [1] (the

explicit form of its spectral curves is yet unknown) the relevant hamiltonians are those of the elliptic

ruijsenaars system, given by the same (15) with

f (0)

ij (a) = s1 

2g2
 (aij)

sn2

 q(aij + | )(aij  | )

(aij| )

(22)

where  is the modulus of the second torus associated with the double elliptic system.

in all these examples h (0)

0 = 1, the theta-functions (n ) are singular and given by determinant
(solitonic) formulas with nite number of items (only terms with ni = 0, 1 survive in the series

expansion of the theta function), and poisson-commutativity of arising hamiltonians is analytically

checked within the theory of ruijsenaars integrable systems.

4.2. beyond the perturbative limit, the analytical evaluation of (n ) becomes less straightforward.

the deformation of the curve (13),

the rst few corrections f (k) to the prepotential are explicitly known in the toda-chain case [12], for

(28)

the coecients k in (26) are expanded into powers of (/a)2n and the leading (zeroth-order)

terms are exactly the perturbative expressions (15). thus, the degenerated ruijsenaars hamiltonians

(15) are just the perturbative approximations to the hk = k/0  the full hamiltonians of integrable

system, dual to the toda chain.

with the help of maple we checked that the rst corrections to the degenerated ruijsenaars

hamiltonians (15) indeed preserve poisson-commutativity. we did it up to the second order in 2n

for n = 3 and up to the rst order for n = 4.

it would be interesting to compare this system with the recently proposed elliptic toda system [13].

5

note that there are three sources of deviations of hk = k/0 from h (0)
k :

 the terms with some ni > 1 are taken into account in the expansion (26)

 fij 6= f (0)

ij

 0 6= 1

we checked that all these deviations are signicant for the poisson-commutativity:

it is impor-

tant to use all the specics of the seiberg-witten riemannian theta-function to obtain the poisson-

commuting hamiltonians.

4.3. similar checks up to the rst non-perturbative order were performed for n = 3 for the duals of

 calogero model  i.e. with f (0)

ij of the form (19)

 ruijsenaars model  i.e. with f (0)

ij of the form (21)

 and the double-elliptic model of ref.[1]  with f (0)

ij of the form (22); in this case the check was

made only with the rst non-trivial correction in q = e2i

note that the period matrix in these cases is expanded into powers of q = e2i :

tij =

+ m 2

i 6= j

(29)



xk=1

and the dimensional constant m depends on the system. e.g., in the calogero model m = im etc.

the limit to the toda system corresponds to q  0, qm 2n =xed.

the result (poisson-commutativity of h1 = 1/0 and h2 = 2/0 in this approximation)

signicantly depends on the form (28) of the rst (instanton-gas) correction to the prepotential. it is

indeed known to be of this form not only for the toda chain, but also for calogero system [14]. for

ruijsenaars and double-elliptic systems eq.(28) is not yet available in the literature. we checked that

(28) is true for these two systems for n = 2 (while we used (28) in calculations for n = 3).

5. in conclusion, we found new non-trivial evidence in support of the claim [1] that the theta-functions

ratios hk = k/0 in the case of seiberg-witten integrable systems provide poisson-commuting

hamiltonians of the dual integrable systems. the real raison detre (and a reasonable proof) of this

property remains to be found.

also, if the universal expressions like (28) in terms of perturbative f (0)

ij  the same for all the
systems  will be found for higher corrections to the prepotentials, this will immediately give an

 to avoid possible confusion, the recurrent relation [15, 17, 16] for the toda-chain prepotential,

and ruijsenaars models and  especially important  the self-dual double-elliptic system which was

explicitly constructed in [1] only for n = 2.

from the toda chains to the calogero and ruijsenaars systems.
