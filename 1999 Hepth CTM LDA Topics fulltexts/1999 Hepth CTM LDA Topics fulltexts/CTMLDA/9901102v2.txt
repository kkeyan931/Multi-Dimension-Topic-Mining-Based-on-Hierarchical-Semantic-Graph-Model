i review a recently proposed method for determining the symmetry superalgebra
of a supergravity conguration from its killing spinors, and its application to the
near-horizon limits of various rotating and intersecting branes.

a conguration of gravitational and matter elds is said to possess a sym-
metry if there is an innitesimal coordinate transformation, associated with
some non-zero vector eld , that leaves invariant all elds, including the met-
ric. the invariance of the metric implies that  is killing and the set of all
such elds closes under commutation to dene the symmetry algebra of the
eld conguration. for a supergravity theory one might analogously dene a
supersymmetric conguration to be one for which there is an innitesimal lo-
cal supersymmetry transformation, asociated with a non-zero anticommuting
spinor eld , that leaves invariant all elds. in this case, however, it is far from
clear how one extracts the symmetry superalgebra from the knowledge of these
spinors. to begin with, there is no way to construct an ordinary vector eld
from anticommuting spinors. to circumvent this problem we may note that
 is dened by a set of linear dierential equations, so a supersymmetric eld
conguration is naturally associated with a common zero mode of a set of dif-
ferential operators. this zero mode is a commuting spinor, but it will generally
have both a body and a soul. the body is an ordinary commuting spinor,
, satisfying the same equations as  but with all background fermions set to
zero. for such purely bosonic backgrounds the supersymmetry variations of
the bosons vanish identically so the equations determining  are found from
the supersymmetry variations of the fermions. these are the killing spinor
equations, and the solutions are the killing spinors. thus, the number of su-
persymmetries of a purely bosonic background equals the dimension of the
space of linearly independent killing spinors.

killing vectors may now be constructed as bilinears of killing spinors. it
is not dicult to verify that the vector eld m m is killing if the spinor
elds  and   are. this suggests that the symmetry superalgebra is deter-
mined by the killing spinor elds (up to purely bosonic factors) just as the
bosonic symmetry algebra is determined by the killing vector elds. one way

1

to see how this works 1 starts by considering the supergravity eld cong-
uration of interest as a background for small uctuations. given a killing
spinor or vector eld of the background it is then possible to construct a time-
independent charge as a functional of the uctuation elds. one thus nds a
set of fermonic charges qf () and a set of bosonic charges qb() for which
the (anti)commutators may be computed via the canonical (anti)commutation
relations of the uctuation elds 1. for the bosonic charges one has

[qb(), qb( )] = qb([,  ]) ,

(1)

so that the algebra of bosonic charges is homomorphic to the algebra of killing
vector elds. for the mixed bosonic, fermionic commutator one has

[qb(), qf ()] = qb(l) ,

(2)

where l is the lie derivative with respect to . note that the lie-derivative
of a spinor eld with respect to a vector eld is dened only if latter is killing,
as is the case here. finally, and most importantly, one has

where

{qf (), qb( )} = qb()

m = m  .

(3)

(4)

what this shows 1 is that the linear combination  of killing vector elds
associated to any pair of killing spinor elds,  and  , is the same as the linear
combination qb() of bosonic charges appearing in the anticommutator of the
fermionic charges qf () and qf ( ). in this way, the symmetry superalgebra
may indeed be deduced, up to purely bosonic factors, from the killing spinors.
in many cases this fact is not needed because a knowledge of the bosonic
symmetry algebra and the number of supersymmetries suces to determine the
superalgebra. a simple example is the maximally supersymmetric ads2  s 2
bertotti-robinson solution of n=2 d=4 supergravity, which arises as the near-
horizon limit of the extreme reissner-nordstrom (rn) black hole 2,3. this
information is sucient to determine the symmetry superalgebra; it can only
be su(1, 1|2), for which the bosonic subalgebra is su(1, 1)su(2). many higher-
dimensional maximally supersymmetric adsp+2 spacetimes arise in a similar
way as near-horizon limits of p-brane solutions of supergravity theories 4, and
if one runs through the list of anti-de sitter superalgebras 5 then one usually
nds that there is only one candidate. an interesting exception occurs for
certain ads2 and ads3 cases. as ads3 superalgebras are direct sums of two

2

ads2 superalgebras, we may concentrate on the ads2 case. there is a one-
parameter family of ads2 superalgebras,

d(2|1; )  su(1, 1)  su(2)  su(2) .

(5)

the parameter 0 <   1 is the relative weight of the the two su(2) subalge-
bras. when  = 1 we have the isomorphism

d(2|1; ) = osp(4|2; r) ,

and it is convenient to dene

d(2|1; 0) = su(1, 1|2)  su(2) .

(6)

(7)

clearly, the parameter  is not determined by a knowedge of the bosonic
symmetry algebra and the number of supersymmetries. the simplest case in
which this ambiguity arises is the d=5 extreme tangherlini black hole, which
is the d=5 generalization of the extreme rn black hole. this is a solution of
d=5 supergravity with a maximally supersymmetric ads2  s 3 near-horizon
limit 6. this near-horizon solution therefore has eight supersymmetries and is
invariant under the isometry group of ads2  s 3. the superalgebra must be
d(2|1; ) for some , but what is the value of ?

in this case there is an indirect argument that  must vanish. this comes
from consideration of angular momentum. it will prove useful to rst consider
rotation in the context of d=4 black holes. the general stationary d=4 black
hole solution depends on one angular momentum parameter, in addition to
its mass and charge parameters, but the requirement of supersymmetry forces
the angular momentum to vanish. this could seem puzzling in view of the
fact that angular momentum does not appear in the anticommutator of super-
symmetry charges of the super-poincare algebra, because this fact implies that
every non-rotating supersymmetric solution is a member of a class of rotat-
ing supersymmetric solutions. indeed it is, but all the rotating solutions have
naked singularities and so fail to qualify as black holes. as an aside, i remark
that angular momentum does appear in the anticommutator of supersymme-
try charges of the ads superalgebra, so in this case the value of the angular
momentum is of direct relevance to supersymmetry. in fact, it turns out 7 that
asymptotically ads supersymmetric d=4 black holes are necessarily rotating;
now it is the non-rotating supersymmetric solutions that are singular!

returning to d=5, we rst note that the general stationary asymptotically
at solution will depend on two angular momenta 8, corresponding to rotation
in two independent 2-planes. when both vanish we have a static black hole
with so(4) hyperspherical symmetry. when they are non-zero but equal the

3

symmetry is reduced to so(3) so(2) and when they are unequal it is further
reduced to so(2)  so(2). in the context of d=5 supergravity these groups
become

su (2)  su (2)  su (2)  u (1)  u (1)  u (1) .

(8)

it turns out that supersymmetry requires both angular momenta to be equal 9.
let j be the one independent angular momentum parameter of the supersym-
metric black hole solutions; for an appropriate normalization one nds that
non-singularity on and outside the event horizon requires |j| < 1. when j = 0
we have the tangherlini bh with its ads2  s 3 near-horizon geometry. when
j 6= 0 we have a rotating version with a near horizon geometry that is no longer
a direct product. let i (i = 1, 2, 3) be the three left-invariant 1-forms on s 3
2+2
satisfying d1 = 23 and cyclic permutations; then d2

is the su (2)  su (2) invariant metric on the unit sphere. in this notation the
near-horizon metric of the rotating supersymmetric d=5 black hole is 10

this metric is clearly su (2)  u (1) invariant, and at least 1/2 supersym-
metric, but its full isometry supergroup is far from evident. an analysis of the
killing spinor equations reveals that supersymmetry is again fully restored in
the near-horizon limit 11. this is remarkable because it suggests that rotation
reduces the near-horizon isometry group without reducing its supersymmetry.
this would be hard to understand unless the su (2) factor that is broken to
u (1) by the rotation is a purely bosonic factor of the isometry supergroup,
and this is the case only if  = 0. in fact, a direct determination 10 of the
symmetry superalgebra using the method described above conrms that the
near-horizon symmetry superalgebra of the d=5 supersymmetric black hole
is su(1, 1|2)  su(2), when j = 0, and su(1, 1|2)  u(1) when j 6= 0. it also
determines the su(1, 1) killing vector elds to bea

h = t
d = rr  2tt
k = [(1  j 2)r4 + 4t2]t  4trr + 2jr2m ,

(10)

where m is the conventionally normalized killing vector eld associated with
the angular momentum parameter j. the remaining su(2) killing vector elds
in the bosonic subalgebra of su(1, 1|2) are the right-invariant vector elds on
s 3.

athe notation used here diers from that of ref. 10.

supersymmetric d=5 black holes have various interpretations as intersect-
ing m-branes. the most straightforward is as three intersecting 12, and possibly
rotating 13, m2-branes, customarily denoted by (0|m 2, m 2, m 2). compacti-
cation on the 6-dimensional space spanned by the m2-branes yields a 1/8
supersymmetric solution of t 6-compactied d=11 supergravity, and a sub-
class (the guven class) yields 1/2 supersymmetric solutions of the equations
of pure d=5 supergravity. an instructive, although less direct, route begins
from the dual (1|m w, m 2, m 5) conguration. wrapping the m2-brane on a
circle and the m5-brane on a 4-torus yields a 1/8 supersymmetric string solu-
tion of t 5-compactied d=11 supergravity. the guven subclass now yields
a 1/2 supersymmetric solution of the pure (1,1) supersymmetric d=6 super-
gravity for which the near-horizon geometry is ads3  s 3, irrespective of the
rotation 14 because its eects can be removed in the near-horizon limit by a
coordinate transformation. the symmetry superalgebra of this near-horizon
solution is

su(1, 1|2)l  su(1, 1|2)r .

(11)

the total number of supersymmetries is thus 16, which is double that of the
d=5 black hole, but only the left supersymmetries survive further reduction
on s 1. moreover, the identication needed to perform this reduction is not
preserved by the coordinate transformation needed to remove the eects of
rotation in the near-horizon limit 1, so that the near-horizon geometry in d=5
depends on the rotation parameter, in agreement with the direct analysis in
d=5. in fact, su (1, 1|2)r is broken to su (2) for zero rotation and to u (1)
for non-zero rotation. we thus recover the d=5 results deduced earlier.

the 1/8 supersymmetric (1|m w, m 2, m 5) conguration of m-theory is a
special case of the 1/8 supersymmetric (1|m w, m 2, m 5, m 5) conguration.
for an appropriate choice of the various (generalized) harmonic functions as-
sociated with the m-wave, m2-brane and m5-brane components, there is a
non-singular near-horizon limit with ads3  s 3  s 3  e2 geometry 15,16, with
the ratio of the two s 3 radii equal to the ratio of the two m5-brane charges.
the number of independent killing spinors is 16, which represents a fourfold
increase in supersymmetry relative to the full intersecting brane conguration
(as was the case for the (1|m w, m 2, m 5) conguration). the reason for this
is that the m-wave is irrelevant in the near-horizon limit because there are no
local degrees of freedom of the gravitational eld in ads3.

the 1/2 supersymmetric adss 3s 3e2 solution of d=11 supergravity
can obviously be viewed as a 1/2 supersymmetric ads3  s 3  s 3 solution of
d=9 maximal supergravity. we now face the problem of determining the
isometry superalgebra of this solution. indirect arguments 16 suggest that it

5

should be

d(2|1; )  d(2|1; )

(12)

with  the ratio of the two s 3 radii. the removal of one m5-brane corresponds
to taking this ratio to zero, and hence to  = 0, which we earlier saw to
be correct. however, these arguments are only suggestive and this example
provides what is perhaps the best illustration of the need for a systematic
method. an application of the method described earlier conrms 1 that the
superalgebra is indeed d(2|1; ), with  the ratio of the two s 3 radii. thus all
values of the parameter  of the ads superalgebra d(2|1; ) have a physical
realization within m-theory.
