abstract

we consider a two-point spatial lattice approximation to an open
string moving in a at background with b eld. it gives a constrained
dipole system under the inuence of a vector potential. solving and
quantizing this system recover all the essential features of a noncom-
mutative space. in particular, open string interactions induce a canon-
ical product structure on the hilbert space of the dipole system. it
coincides with the usual star product, even though the position opera-
tors can be thought of as mutually commuting. modication of gauge
transformations in this noncommutative space also naturally emerges.

1 introduction and ideology

in the passage from classical to quantum mechanics, the physical observables
of a system, which are functions on its phase space, become the operators on
the hilbert space of physical states. the canonical commutation relations of
heisenberg

[x , p] = h


(1.1)

require as well as epitomize this fundamental change. thus in the quantum
world the phase space ceases to be a normal space, because the notion of it
as being made up of well dened points becomes invalid (the uncertainty
principle). rather than a function that evaluates at each point of phase
space, a physical observable w (x, p ) must be understood in its entirety as
an operator. this is how algebraic operations on them are performed. in
particular, multiplications among operators are associative but generically
noncommutative. this is an instance of noncommutative geometry.
by contrast, other parts of the canonical commutation relations

[x , x ] = 0

(1.2)

indicate that the coordinates on the conguration space form a set of com-
muting observable and remain simultaneously measurable. the usual point-
based geometry of the conguration space therefore survives. wavefunctions,
or more generally elds on it, obtain values at each point and algebraic op-
erations are performed pointwise.

it is perhaps only natural to go one step further and pass onto some non-
commutative geometry for the conguration space as well. for curiositys
sake it intrigues to see what transpires when wavefunctions and elds be-
come noncommutative objects, but from what sort of physical system would
such circumstances arise in the rst place? one class of such scenarios have
recently been uncovered: the matrix theory [1] naturally accommodates non-
commutative tori [2]. subsequently it is shown how heisenberg-like commu-
tation relations such as

[x , x ] = 

(1.3)

apply to the coordinate elds on the ends of an open string. in particular, 
is nonvanishing if so is the background for the anti-symmetric rank two tensor
b [3]. a noncommutative product of functions of the xs also appear in
the operator product expansion on the open string boundary [4, 5].

1

this is of course not the rst time noncommutative geometry has been
advocated to play a role in (open) string theory. in [6], a noncommutative but
associative algebra quite naturally emerged from type i string theory and
was essential in formulating a string eld theory. however, this underlying
space of that algebra is very large and complicated. it is the space of open
paths in space-time. using the terminology for open string quantization,
it includes not only the wavefunction of the center of mass coordinates,
but also those of the innite tower of oscillators. somewhere among them
one would like to discern the most basic features of the space-time. the
aim of this brief note is precisely to extract this piece of information.
in
section two we truncate the theory of an open string ending on a d-brane
to a constrained quantum mechanical model for its two end points. this
dipole system inherits a noncommutative product structure on its hilbert
space from the open string interaction. we show that it coincides with the
star product in deformation quantization in section three. this model
allows us also to study how the usual gauge transformations are deformed in
noncommutative geometry. finally, we give some remarks.

2 the constrained dipole model

in the conformal gauge, the free action for an open string starting and ending
on the same (single) d-brane is

s =

4 z
+z2

d2hg(cid:16) y  y   y y (cid:17) + b(cid:16) y y   y  y (cid:17)i
d a(y ) y  z1

d a(y ) y .

(2.1)

here the subscripts 2 and 1 on  label the two boundaries of the
open string worldsheet. g and b are constant backgrounds for the metric
and rank two anti-symmetric tensor elds respectively. a is the background
gauge potential for a constant u(1) eld strength on the d-brane. the
term involving b is a locally exact, can be replaced by an integral on the
boundaries, and absorbed by a  a + bx . we will do so in the rest of

 see also [7].

the paper and henceforth drop any explicit reference to b, writing the action
more succinctly as

s =

4 z
+z2

d2(cid:16) y 2  y 2(cid:17)
d a(y ) y  z2

d a(y ) y .

(2.2)

unless otherwise specied, we will also restrict our attention to the spatial
part of the target space-time for which f = da is nondegenerate, assuming
that the background allows such a decomposition. the full solution of the
equation of motion requires the boundary condition

1
2 gy  = f y .

(2.3)

now we approximate the spatial extent of the open string by a lattice
of two points, situated at the two boundaries and labeled accordingly. let
the width of the string be 2/. then spatial derivative y  is approximated
by 

2 (y2  y1), and the action (eq. 2.2) by

s = z d "

these are precisely the dirac brackets for coordinate elds on the string
boundaries found in [3].

it turns out to be instructive to use the variables

x  = (y 

2 + y 

1 )/2,

s = (y 

2  y 

1 )/2.

(2.13)

in term of them, the quantum commutation relations for the constrained
system are

[x , s] = 



1
2

(2.14)

(2.15)

but at the same time

[x , x ] = 0 = [s, s]

therefore the xs and the ss separately each make a complete set of com-
muting observables. since the xs are the center of mass coordinates of
the dipole system, that they commute seems at rst sight contrary to the
spirit of noncommutative geometry, yet we shall show presently that it is
precisely in terms of these commuting coordinates that a familiar type of
noncommutative algebra naturally emerges.

3 space noncommutativity

in [6] it is observed that type i string theory naturally gives rise to a non-
commutative product: gluing the right end of one open string to the left end
of another yields a new open string. this process is at once obviously non-
commutative but associative. it is also much in the spirit of the chan-paton
factors in resembling the multiplication of matrices through the contraction
of adjacent covariant and contravariant indices:

(mn)a

b  m a

c n c
b .

open string elds, however, are big and unwieldy objects, and there are vary-
ing schemes to implement the actual product. however, any good product
should have one thing in common.
it should be compatible with the way
open strings interact, just as in eld theory pointwise multiplication of elds
(wavefunctions) represent their pointwise interaction in a second quantized
theory. all purely open string interactions can be reduced to the process of
two open strings joining together at one boundary and merge into another

5

open string. this is what a good product of open string elds should de-
scribe. what happens to the interior of the strings must be complex and one
needs to perform gauge xing to describe it, but at least the wavefunctions of
two adjacent end points get contracted. on the other hand, in reducing
the open string to the dipole system (eq. 2.6), the end points are what is
left of the string. thus string interaction induces a canonical product on the
hilbert space h of the dipole system.

because the xs form a complete set of commuting observables, states
in h space can be written as functions of them. to write out the sought
product, however, it is convenient to choose another basis. in light of (eq.
2.12), h has a tensor product structure h2  h1. hi is the hilbert space
associated with the i-th endpoint, furnishing a representation for yi in (eq.
2.12). h2 and h1 are canonically isomorphic. choosing a basis of states |zii
for hi, the product on h is dened by

(|z2i2  |z1i1)  (|z

2i2  |z

1i1)  (hz1||z

2i)|z2i2  |z

1i1.

(3.1)

the explicit calculation is carried out by rst choosing from the y2s a
maximal set of commuting operators {z2}. the corresponding operator {z1}
from the z1s is similarly a maximal commuting set in light of (eq. 2.12).
we also divide the xs into x = (z1 + z2)/2 and x being the rest. the
eigenstates of the zis furnish a set of basis for hi suitable for use in (eq.
3.1). using (eq. 2.12), one nd the conversion matrix elements between this
and the x basis that diagonalizes the xs:

hx|(|z2i2  |z1i1) = (x  (z2 + z1)/2) exp(cid:18) 

4

1

 x(z

2  z

1 )(cid:19).

(3.2)

using this, we nd that the product in (eq. 3.1) is explicitly given by

x=x=x

.

(3.3)



x!1(x)2(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(1  2)[x] = exp  

2

 
x

it coincides with the star product studied by mathematicians in deformation
quantization.

this product structure also implies two maps from a state (x) in h to
an operator  acting on h. these maps are one-to-one but not onto. to
see what kind of operators one can obtain from a wavefunction (x), note

6

that by (eq. 2.14) s is realized as an operator on h as follows:

s = 


2

 
x

therefore we can rewrite (eq. 3.3) as

(1  2)[x] = 1(x + s)2(x)  12(x)

with

  (y2) = (x + s).

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

being understood as an operator. it is easy to convince oneself that this map
is an algebra homomorphism:

12 = (1  2).

(3.7)

treating (eq. 3.3) as an operator  acting on the state 1 gives us an
analogous map

with the property

  (y1) = (x  s)

12 = (2  1).

(3.8)

(3.9)

in more abstract language, 1 and 2 act on the same module h from left
and right respectively. they always commute.

we can now deduce how gauge transformation would aect the con-
strained dipole. the action (eq. 2.6) by itself implies that under an in-
nitesimal transformation a  a + (x), the wavefunction changes its
phase by a position dependent exp(y2)(y1). the constraints (eq. 2.7)
change the story by making the y s noncommuting operators. under an
innitesimal , the wavefunction changes by

(x) = i(  )(x) = i((x)  (x)  (x)  (x)).

(3.10)

for nite ,

(x)  exp(x) (x)  exp((x)) = exp exp

 (x)

(3.11)

where



expf (x) 

xn=0

1
n!

f (x)  f (x)     n times     f (x).

(3.12)

the originally abelian u(1) gauge group now becomes non-abelian.

on account that  is anti-symmetric, there is no operator ordering ambiguity in

treating 1(x + s), 2(y2), or the like, as formal power series.

4 remarks

after the work reported here had been completed, a preprint appeared [7]
that discussed some related issues and employed a quantum mechanical
model resembling the one used here but without the constraints (eq. 2.7).

subsequently, another preprint on related subjects appeared [5]. among
other issues, it studied gauge bosons on d-branes with constant background
b eld in relation to noncommutative geometry. by contrast, gauge boson
dynamics is not visible in the model studied in the present paper. this is
because in throwing out the bulk degrees of freedom to obtain (eq. 2.6)
one removes all the oscillator parts of the string eld. hence only a scalar
particle, namely the tachyon, remains in (eq. 2.6). one can try to include the
photon with a more elaborate model. on the other hand, while its physics is
relatively simple, (eq. 2.6) can serve as a systematic and tractable probe for
noncommutative space in a way akin to how d0-branes can probe various
objects in string theory.
