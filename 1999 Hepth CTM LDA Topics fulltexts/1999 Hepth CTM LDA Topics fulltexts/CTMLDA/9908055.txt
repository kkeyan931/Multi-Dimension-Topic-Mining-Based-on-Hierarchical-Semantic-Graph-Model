massive schwinger-thirring model zero-charge sector , two-dimensional (2d) lattice abelian higgs model , 2d neutral yukawa gas , on. also, 2d msgft useful investigations uid membranes  vortices 2d superconductors . therefore, general importance explore various properties msgft. fact, many investigations 2d msgft existed. early 1970s, 2d msgft analyzed within framework constructive quantum eld theory. existence 2d msgft proved certain region parameter space , frohlich et al also showed nontriviality scattering, existence one boson states (fermion-anti-fermion bound state), zero-charge physical states 2d msgft, . recently, order reveal phase structure 2d abelian higgs model  discuss intrinsic nite size eect 2d superconductors , 2d msgft nite momentum cuto treated renormalization-group technique. additionally, equivalent system massive schwinger model, msgft investigated large m2 0 fermi-mass perturbation (1975) , light front  nite densities and/or temperatures  discuss chiral condensate, quark connement, -vacuum, particle spectra, etc.. using gaussian wave-functional approach (gwfa) , also quantitative investigation ground, one- two-particle states 2d msgft zero vacuum angle . nevertheless, feel 2d msgft still many problems worth investigating. instance, spontaneous breakdown z2-symmetry (z2ssb) interesting phenomenon. stated rst paragraph, z2-symmetry classical vacuum 2d msgft spontaneously broken . z2ssb classical vacuum means classical potential minimum, example, two points eld space = 1 (here, 1 positive), say, two-fold degenerate (innitely degenerate sgft), accordingly classical vacuum occasionally located one two points = 1 consequently z2-symmetry broken. similarly, quantum level, eective potential quantum eld theory is, example, two-fold degenerate, quantum vacuum spontaneously located non-zero eld point, accordingly z2-symmetry also spontaneously broken. 1970s, ref.  infered 2d msgft z2ssb classical level would mailing address,e-mail: wenfalu@online.sh.cn 1 usually maintained quantum level, ref.  pointed qualitatively, based semiclassical calculation, bosonic equivalent massive schwinger model z2-symmetry suers spontaneous breakdown case. besides, ref.  pointed z2-symmetry 2d msgft presumably dynamically broken case. recently, also demonstrated explicitly existence z2-ssb phenomenon within framework gwfa . however, compared occurs classical level, inuence quantum eects z2-ssb phenomenon clear. usually, quantum eects alter z2-symmetry vacuum, accordingly turn symmetric vacuum classical level asymmetric one quantum level, vice verse, asymmetric vacuum classical level symmetric one quantum level. latter called restoration z2-symmetry (1996), former called dynamical breakdown z2-symmetry (z2dsb) paper. dynamical breakdown 1, mean quantum eects z2-symmetry enjoyed classical vacuum spontaneously broken quantum level. z2dsb occurs, also say z2-symmetry dynamically spontaneously broken, really involved type phenomenon occured pure 4 model . eld theory, occurences disappearances z2-symmetry restoration z2dsb seen comparison two regions parameter space z2ssb occurs respectively classical quantum

framework gwfa, shall continue investigate 2d msgft zero vacuum angle, explicitly give region parameter space z2-symmetry restored, discuss z2dsb, analyze inuence nite temperature eect them. z2-symmetry restoration z2dsb interesting important. inverse other, correspond phase transitions occur inverse directions. also mirror aspects quantum eects. besides, z2-symmetry restoration reverse fate fase vacuum . early 1981, rajaraman lakshmi proposed rst time concept symmetry restoration demonstrated explicitly restoration z2-symmetry special 2d 6 model , loop-expansion eective-potential method . later, re-investigation model appealing method revealed dependence symmetry-restoring result upon renormalization condition . later again, monte carlo numerical study another slightly dierent 2d 6 theory three degenerate vacua showed quantum corrections make vacuum z2-symmetrical . recently, re-investigated two 6 models gwfa demonstrated well restoration z2symmetry . although two models display restoration z2- symmetry, (in continuum, lattice case) intrinsically dependent upon renormalized condition  2, model ref.  little typical classical vacuum three-fold degenerate. 4 model good

extend also shrink parameter region classical vacuum z2-symmetrical. then, nite temperature introduced 2d msgft, parameter regions z2-symmetry restoration z2dsb quantum eects extended shrinked nite temperature eect? interesting problem. z2-symmetry restoration region extended, z2dsb region shrinked, say z2-symmetry restored nite temperature eect . phenomenon important particle physics, cosmology condensed matter physics  (1996). present paper, using gwfa thermoeld dynamics , shall consider inuence nite temperature z2-symmetry 2d msgft zero vacuum angle. one see 2d msgft, 1originally, dynamical symmetry breakdown rst used mean chiral symmetry enjoyed classical lagrangian njl model broken quantum radiation corrections, see ref. . 2here, word intrinsically means dependence upon

dynamically breaking z2-symmetry. zero- nite-temperature cases, paper make use gwfa investigations. although dicult control accuracy gwfa, gwfa succeeded extracting non-perturbative information many
