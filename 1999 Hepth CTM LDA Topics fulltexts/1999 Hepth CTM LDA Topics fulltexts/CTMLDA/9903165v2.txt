i discuss d0-brane quantum mechanics as a nonperturbative formulation of string theory,
in particular the relation between the banksfischlershenkersusskind matrix model, the
maldacena conjecture for d0-branes, and type iia/m-theory duality. some features of the
quantum mechanics of d0-branes are also discussed.

1.

introduction

the main focus of this lecture is d0-brane quantum mechanics as a nonper-
turbative formulation of string theory.
in particular i would like to discuss the
relation between the banksfischlershenkersusskind matrix model, 1) the mal-
dacena conjecture for d0-branes 2), 3), and type iia/m-theory duality. 4) this has
sometimes been a confusing subject, and it is one of which everyone has their own
understanding.)
i
have certainly added to it in the past; the present version reects my improved
understanding.

i hope that i will reduce rather than add to the confusion.

figure 1 is a schematic picture of the lessons of string duality, one that i have
drawn perhaps a hundred times. it is intended to emphasize the limited range of
conventional string theory, which only provides an asymptotic expansion at the ve
stringy cusps. this is true even when one includes d-branes  only asymptotically
in the string coupling do these provide a quantitatively accurate description. to
describe the complete physics at a nite distance from a cusp, and to reach the m-
theory point with 11-dimensional lorentz invariance, requires a leap, a conjecture,
to a new idea with a greater range of validity. this new idea can only be guessed,
not deduced from information already in string theory.

this has always been the intended message of gure 1, but as i will explain
i now believe, rather surprising, that one can actually deduce a great deal from
what is already known. the main outline of this talk is the description of four
limits: the dkps limit, the sss limit, the bglhks limit, and the imsy limit.
actually, these are all the same limit of type iia string theory, but presented in
dierent ways and with dierent emphases. i will then explain how these dierent
descriptions illuminate the relations among the various ideas. at the end i discuss
possible future directions in d0-brane quantum mechanics, and some properties of
the d0-brane bound state.

2. the douglaskabatpouliotshenker (dkps) limit

consider a state in the iia string theory containing n d0-branes plus any

collection of open and closed strings.) the energy of such a state is

h =

s xm,n

tr([x m, x n]2) + spin term + higher derivs. (2.1)

here gs is the dimensionless string coupling and ls = ()1/2 is the string length scale.
the rst term is the d0-brane rest energy. the second is the mass of excited open or
closed strings. the third is from massless closed strings, with momenta of order q.
the important terms are in the second line. the rst is a nonrelativistic kinetic
term, p 2/2m, except that it is a trace over n 2 terms rather than a sum over n
terms. this is a reection of the important non-abelian geometry of d-branes. 7)
the coordinates arise from the lightest open string state

m

1/2|iji .

(2.2)

this state has a 9-dimensional spatial index m and so naturally corresponds to a
collective coordinate. the ket |iji denotes a string that begins on the ith d0-brane
and ends on the jth, so the coordinate x m
ij is a matrix in the n -dimensional d0-brane
index space. then p m
is the conjugate momentum. the potential term corrects
ij

this overcounting. it is nonnegative (the minus sign canceling an i2) and vanishes
precisely when all the x m commute and so can be diagonalized. further, there is
a u (n ) gauge invariance, so the state is independent of basis and the low energy
physics reduces to the quantum mechanics of the 9n eigenvalues, as appropriate for
n particles in 9 + 1 dimensions.

the potential term has the same form as the 4-gluon yangmills interaction
tr(f mnfmn). this is no accident, the two being related by t -duality. the omit-
ted spin terms are such that the system has 16 linearly realized supersymmetries,
generating 256 states for each d0-brane.

now let us take the dkps limit, 8) which is gs  0 while holding xed all of

n , p , q , m = g1/3

(2.3)

it follows from the energy (2.1) that all closed strings decouple, as do excited open
strings, leaving only massless open strings with

h =

(2.4)

thus in this limit the iia string theory becomes very simple, just the matrix quantum
mechanics 9) (2.4). the string coupling is taken to zero, but because of the scaling
of the energy the most relevant interaction does survive.

summary: the matrix hamiltonian (2.4) describes the sector of iia string

theory with d0-brane-charge n , in the dkps limit (2.3).

3. the susskindseibergsen (sss) limit

the iia string is m-theory compactied on a circle of radius r10 = gsls, with
1/3
. the d0-brane charge is the number
eleven-dimensional planck length m = g
s
of units of compact momentum, n = p10r10. in terms of m-theory parameters, the
dkps limit takes r10  0 while holding xed all of

l1
s

p10r10 , p , q , m , h =

1

m r10

(h  p10) .

(3.1)

this scaling of the energy has a simple pictorial interpretation, as in gure 2. for
any nite r10 we can nd a frame in which the spatial radius takes an arbitrary
xed value r
10; the cost is that the periodicity is no longer at equal times but at
nearly null separations. the lorentz factor is  = r

10/r10 and so

(h  p10) =

r

r10

(h  p10) = m r

10h .

(3.2)

10 = n/r

since p
in the boosted frame of gure 2b. thus we have a new interpretation: 10), 11), 12)

10 is xed, the dkps limit is equivalent to holding xed the energy

summary: the matrix hamiltonian (2.4) describes m-theory in a space com-
pactied in a lightlike direction, in the sector with n units of compact momentum.

this is dened as the limit of spacelike compactication, keeping all states that have
nite energy in the limit. the eleven-dimensional planck scale and the noncompact
momenta are held xed in the limit.

4. the balasubramaniangopakumarlarsenhyunkiemshin

(bglhks) limit

an important renement of the preceding picture comes when we consider that
the particles carrying p10 must gravitate. with matter in the periodic space one
would not expect that the compactied direction remain precisely null. a pertur-
bation towards timelike compactication is implausible, so likely any gravitational
eect is in the direction of making the periodicity spacelike. indeed, as a function
of distance r from the source, the radius of the compact dimension is given in terms
of the black 0-brane dilaton solution 13)

here and in the metric below numerical constants have been ignored. in the last
line we have taken the dkps limit, gs  0 at xed m . the striking feature is that
the radius r10(r) has a nonvanishing limit, and only when r   does the radius
of the compact dimension go to zero. thus the geometry is only asymptotically as
depicted in gure 2b. 14), 15)

let us develop somewhat further the nature of the resulting space. the rst
obvious separation occurs at r  n 1/7/m , where e(r) is of order one. at larger
r, r10(r) is less than m 1 and so the eective description is in terms of weakly
coupled iia string theory. at smaller r, r10(r) is greater than m 1 and so the
eective description is in terms of m-theory.

to go further examine the m-theory metric, obtained by lifting the black d0-

brane metric to m-theory in the coordinate system of gure 2b,

ds2 = dt2 + dx2

10 +

m 9r7r2

(4.2)

the periodicity is

(t, x

10) = (t  r

10, x

10 + r

10) .

(4.3)

the metric appears at at large r, but this deceptive because the radius of the
periodic dimension and so the local string tension are going to zero. the latter is

t (r) = m 3r10(r) = n 1/2m 3/2r7/2 .

(4.4)

the corresponding length scale ls(r) = n 1/4m 3/4r7/4 exceeds r when r > n 1/3m 1.
at this point geometry can no longer make sense: the strings are larger than the
system (in terms of the string metric, which is curved, the curvature becomes large
in string units).

another key distance is r = n 1/9m 1, where r10(r) = r. at distances below
this the metric (4.2) is no longer correct. since generic sources will not be uniformly
distributed in x10, the resulting metric will not be uniform either. this eect damps
away when r > r10(r) (the space is then long in the r-direction and narrow in the
x10-direction). finally, when r < m 1 we would not expect any classical metric to
be a good description. collecting together these results gives 14), 15), 3)

n 1/3m 1 < r

we have been treating the sources as pointlike. this is true, for example, for
the ground state, which is a single graviton with n units of compact momentum. 4)
for more distributed sources, the geometry below a given r would be smoothed out.
summary: the matrix hamiltonian (2.4) describes m-theory in the sector with
n units of compact momentum, where the compactied dimension is asymptoti-
cally lightlike. that is, it describes all states whose metric is asymptotically of the
form (4.2).

5. the itzhakimaldacenasonnenscheinyankielowicz (imsy) limit

now let us think about the matrix hamiltonian (2.4) directly. if we rescale to

new canonical variables

p  m 1/2 p , x  m 1/2 x ,

(5.1)

then the kinetic term is canonically normalized and the x 4 interaction has a coe-
cient m 3. the latter is the correct dimension for a yangmills coupling-squared in
0 + 1 dimensions. the eective dimensionless coupling at an energy scale e is then

g2
e = n m 3/e3 ,

(5.2)

the n being from the usual t hooft counting. 16) at e > n 1/3m , the eective
coupling is small and quantum mechanical perturbation theory is good. when e <
n 1/3m , perturbation theory breaks down  we have a strongly coupled problem. in
the past this might have been a diculty, but now that we are in the age of duality
it presents an opportunity, to nd a weakly coupled description.
indeed, this is
what imsy do. 3) by essentially the dkps plus bglhks arguments, they show
that the low energy physics of the matrix hamiltonian is given by iia/m-theory in
the supergravity background (4.2).

in making the connection, there are two points that should be claried. first,

the imsy limit sounds dierent, in that it holds xed 3)

however the same dimensionless quantities,

m r = u/g2/3

ym , h/m = (h  p10)/g2/3

ym

(5.3)

(5.4)

are held xed in the two limits.)

second, the imsy limit is a statement about the physics as a function of energy
scale. to relate this to the previous discussion, consider a standard observable, the
expectation value of a product of local operators with some characteristic external
energy e. if the reader is more comfortable in euclidean space, he/she is free to
analytically continue, since the quantum mechanics and the supergravity have a com-
mon global time (which in the supergravity is dened by the asymptotic translation
invariance). a local operator in the qm is equivalent to some local disturbance in
the supergravity. the only coordinate invariant local objects live at the boundary
(coordinate transformations at the boundary are frozen by the specication of the
asymptotic behavior), so by logic similar to the ads/cft case 17) we are led to the
conclusion that these correspond to deformations of the boundary conditions.
in
this sense the qm lives at the boundary at innity, but it should be emphasized
that it contains all states of the bulk theory.

these boundary deformations do not change the d0-brane charge, and so corre-
spond to boundary conditions that are invariant under translations in the periodic
dimension: they depend on t and x10 only in the combination t + x10, of the form
exp ie (t + x10). acting on these the wave operator reduces to

(5.5)

10 drops out after converting the sss energy e  to the
note that the arbitrary r
matrix qm energy e via eq. (3.2). from the relative scaling of the two terms in the
wave operator it follows that the supergravity amplitude is dominated by the radial
scale 18)

r  n 1/5e2/5m 7/5  e  n 1/2r5/2m 7/2 .

(5.6)

this is the holographic energy-radius relation. 19) in particular, the energy e =
n 1/3m corresponds to r = n 1/3m 1. at higher energies/larger radii the geomet-
ric picture breaks down but matrix qm perturbation theory is valid. at lower
energies/smaller radii, qm perturbation theory breaks down but the supergravity
description is valid. at successively lower energies the physics is described by the
successive supergravity pictures of the previous section. it is not clear how to un-
derstand e < n 1/2m , where the supergravity breaks down at short distance, but
we will argue in the next section that things become simple again at e  n 1m .
note that the only threshold visible in the t hooft (spherical) limit is e  n 1/3m
corresponding to r  n 1/3m 1.

summary: the matrix hamiltonian (2.4) is equivalent to m-theory in the sector
with n units of compact momentum, where the compactied dimension is asymp-
totically lightlike. in the preceding discussion we were using this to dene m-theory,
but we can also use it in the other direction: low energy supergravity is the eective
theory for the strongly coupled qm at e < n 1/3m .

6. discussion

let us now consider the implications of the preceding results. one thing that
i nd particularly striking is the bglhks picture. we are conditioned to think
of the gs  0 limit as being strictly 10-dimensional. now we see that in a sector
of large but xed d0-brane charge n , a nite bubble of 11-dimensional spacetime
survives at n 1/9m 1 < r < n 1/7m 1. this grows arbitrarily large at large n .
thus, the large-n matrix qm describes 11-dimensional bulk physics. the derivation
appear to be quite reliable. on the qm side we have string theory with the coupling
and the energy (in string units, above the bps minimum) going to zero; we surely
understand string theory in this regime. on the m-theory side, the geometry is
quite smooth as gs  0 in the indicated range of r. this is completely opposite
to the mindset expressed in the introduction and gure 1, in that the nature of
the 11-dimensional theory has been deduced from string perturbation theory. this
is shown schematically in gure 3: the n -axis, rather than being perpendicular to
the old parameter space, actually runs from the iia vacuum toward the m-theory

vacuum. of course the key input is iia/m-theory duality  this turns out to have
a great deal more information than was initially evident.

the imsy result, or maldacena duality for d0-branes, also appears to be a great
deal of information from very little.
it tells us about the behavior of a quantum
mechanical system at strong coupling. again, the key input is iia/m-theory duality
 with little additional information this implies the imsy result.

now consider the bfss matrix theory. 1) the statement above, that the large-n
matrix qm describes 11-dimensional physics, would appear to be morally the same
thing. however, the bfss theory is more specic.) given the above discussion, the
natural way to dene the 11-dimensional s-matrix would be to begin with n source
d0-branes, to create the 11-dimensional bubble, and then to consider scattering of
supergravity elds corresponding to local operators in the qm, aimed to intersect in
the bubble. this is parallel to recent constructions in the ads5 case, with d3-branes
replaced by d0-branes. 20), 21)

the bfss proposal is dierent, and more direct. namely, scattering of matrix
theory bound states is supposed to go directly over to the m-theory s-matrix in the
large-n limit. the sss picture suggests a derivation of this. 12) consider gravitons
(bound states) with d0-brane charges n1, n2, and so on. scale the ni to innity

together, and take r

are then constant. the size of the box is going to innity, in a frame in which the
scattering event is held xed. one might then expect that the limit would give the
noncompact theory.

compactication is surely more subtle, because the invariant radius of the compact
dimension remains at zero. indeed, the null compactication leads to specic eects
that might complicate the limit. the rst is zero tension strings, from membranes
wrapping the periodic dimension. 22) the second is divergent uctuations of modes
with compact momentum zero. these arise because the eective 10-dimensional
coupling in eld theory would be g2

11/r10, which diverges in the lightlike limit.)

in some eld theory examples these eects dominate and the large-n limit does
not give the noncompact theory. however, in the present case the bglhks eect
seems to do away with potential problems. note that the relevant distance scale p1
and relevant energy e  p2/ni are both quite small, where the graviton transverse
momentum p is held xed as n  . (these do not satisfy the holographic rela-
tion (5.6) because they correspond to a dierent quantity in the qm theory.) at
this distance the periodic dimension is very far from lightlike due to the gravitational
eect of the d0-branes. thus the wrapped membrane tension is large compared to
the scale of the scattering, and so is the 10-dimensional planck scale.

one might still have the following concern. at very large r (the t hooft scale)
the spacetime interpretation does break down as we have argued earlier, due to a
string tension that vanishes asymptotically and also to a 10-dimensional coupling
that diverges asymptotically. the gravitons come in from innite r, and so begin
and end in this non-spacetime region. how, then, can we get the physics of at 11-
dimensional spacetime? the point is that at these asymptotic distances the gravitons
are propagating freely, at energies small compared to the characteristic energies of
the qm. all that matters then is the metric on moduli space, and this is simply
at as a consequence of supersymmetry  it does not matter that at the t hooft
radius we stop interpreting it as the moduli space of particles in spacetime and begin
interpreting as the moduli space of the quantum mechanics.)

thus the potential objections to the seibergsen argument seem to be red her-
rings in this case. the bfss matrix theory, like the imsy duality, can indeed be
deduced from perturbative string theory and iia/m-theory duality. for the zero
modes we can say that they cure their own problem, in that the bglhks eect is
the expectation value of the gravitational zero mode.

let me conclude with some comments about the relation between perturbative
matrix theory amplitudes and supergravity or m-theory amplitudes. from the liter-
ature one might get the impression that these are expected to agree in general: that
if an amplitude has the same dependence on the parameters in the two theories (m ,
n , r, and v) then its form and coecient must be the same. i can confess to sloppy
thinking in this regard in the past. but in fact there is no general reason that there
should be agreement. the ranges of validity are entirely dierent, e/m < n 1 vs
e/m > n 1/3, and as in any eective eld theory there is no general reason to expect
amplitudes at dierent scales to have any simple relation. for example, the exact
amplitude could involve a function of e3/m 3n which asymptotes to one value at

) zero mode divergences in light-cone eld theory are a long story. for discussions in the

context of the lightlike limit see refs. 23), 24).

high energy and to a dierent one at low energy. of course some amplitudes are pro-
tected by supersymmetry nonrenormalization theorems and so must agree:
if they
did not it would falsify matrix theory and possibly iia/m-theory duality as well. it
is still interesting to compare calculations in the two limits, both as a way to infer
new supersymmetric nonrenormalization theorems (since supersymmetry appears to
be a strong restriction) and also because this is the route by which new dualities,
such as the maldacena duality, are sometimes discovered.

7. what next?

the conclusion is that the large-n matrix qm gives the m-theory limit of string
theory. it is one of many nonperturbative constructions of string theory, since we
can take a similar large-n limit in any of the maldacena dualities. certainly these
constructions are not yet in simplest form: string theory is constructed in states with
specic, and unusual, boundary conditions. there should be some general framework
describing all states of string theory  spacetimes without boundaries are especially
puzzling from the present viewpoint. this will likely involve some new ideas, and
look rather dierent from the current descriptions.

still, one way to try to proceed is to develop more fully the existing constructions.
much attention goes to the ads5  s5 and ads3  s3 cases because of their large
symmetries, but the matrix qm/d0-brane case would seem to have advantages as
well, due to its smaller number of degrees of freedom.

as an example, it would be nice to have a direct test of the maldacena duality,
comparing two calculations at the same point in parameter space without the aid
of nonrenormalization results. the simplest place to look is the d0-brane qm, just
below the t hooft energy. the duality predicts that the gauge theory entropy is
given by the nonextremal d0-brane entropy as

s = cn 2t 9/5(m 3n )3/5

(7.1)

with c a known constant. 25) the exponent 9/5 indicates the nontriviality of the
dynamics. as the temperature is reduced the eect of the commutator potential is
to freeze out degrees of freedom in a gradual way, but the precise exponent appears
to be dicult to get by analytic means. however, this entropy should be accessible
by monte carlo (i should emphasize that this is very dierent from the index-like
path integrals that have been calculated, in that the thermal boundary conditions
break supersymmetry.). in eld theory we would need to renormalize to maintain the
supersymmetry in the cuto theory, but qm is superrenormalizable. also, at this
relatively high temperature precise supersymmetric cancellations are not so relevant,
and high temperature methods may also simplify the fermionic determinant. there
is unlikely to be enough dynamic range at reasonable values of n to pick out the
9/5 accurately, but for the monte carlo calculation to come close to the value of c
obtained in a black hole calculation would be very striking.

of course the ikkt matrix theory 26) should be even simpler than the bfss
model from this point of view, and it has been studied numerically. the question
here is one of interpretation. the assumption in much of the literature appears to

m-theory and the light cone

11

be that the ikkt model is a background-independent formulation of string theory,
but an interpretation parallel to imsy 3) seems more likely. the portion of the
ikkt matrix integral where the eigenvalues are well-separated can be calculated
perturbatively, but this breaks down when the eigenvalues become close. the natural
extension of the imsy analysis would be that there is an eective description of the
latter part of the matrix integral in terms of supergravity in an asymptotically d-
instanton space. for a numerical test one would need to nd a simple prediction
parallel to the entropy (7.1).

another advantage of being in qm is that renormalization is not needed, so
we can add arbitrary perturbations to the hamiltonian and so study more general
spaces.

a related advantage is that the wavefunction and operators have a direct mean-
ing. consider for example the size r of the d0-brane bound state.) in the bfss
paper 1), two estimates are given,

from t hooft scaling and

r  n 1/3m 1

r  n 1/9m 1

(7.2)

(7.3)

from the quantum mechanics of the v4/r7 potential. the relation between these was
not resolved (though at least one of the authors [b] came to the conclusion that we
will reach below). it was suggested that the t hooft result might be invalidated by
ir divergences, but in fact one can show that it is rigorously correct. start with the
uncertainty principle, applied to one matrix element x 1

11:

h0|(x 1

11)2|0ih0|(p 1

11)2|0i  1 .

applying this to all 9n 2 elements gives)

h0|tr(x 1x 1)|0ih0|tr(p np n)|0i  9n 4 .

(7.4)

(7.5)

now apply the virial theorem, relating the expectation value of the kinetic term to
that of the potential. from h0|[x np n, h]|0i = 0 one obtains for the expectation
values 2k + 4p + f = 0, where k is the kinetic term, p is the potential, and
f is the fermionic term (linear in x). on the other hand k + p + f = 0 by
supersymmetry. thus k : p : f = 1 : 1 : 2, and so

for hermitean matrices the schwarz inequality gives |tr(abab)| < tr(aabb) <

for x 1 having an eigenvalue distribution of width r, the left-hand side is of order
n 2r6 and so

r  o(n 1/3m 1) .

(7.9)

this assumes that the expectation value of (x 1)4 converges, as is indeed the
case. this result, obtained from a hamiltonian born-oppenheimer approximation
in refs. 28), can be nicely explained by an eective hamiltonian analysis (this is
adapted from an unpublished argument of l. susskind, with comments from g. m.
graf). the dangerous direction is when the wavefunction separates into two blocks,
along the at directions. here the relative coordinate is described by a free u (1)
theory, so the hamiltonian is just the laplacian and the wavefunction is harmonic.
for l = 0 the wavefunction falls as r7. the bound state has l = 2, because the
relative spin plus motion gives an invariant, and so falls as r9. then

h0|tr[(x 1)l]|0i  z d9x |x|18+l

(7.10)

converges for l < 9.

note that (7.9) is exactly the maximum radius in which the supergravity picture
is valid. i therefore strongly expect that n 1/3m 1 is the actual value, not just a
lower bound.

how does this relate to the smaller estimate (7.3)? the bound (7.9) comes
primarily from the quantum uctuations of the o-diagonal modes of x n, while the
smaller estimate refers to the diagonal motion on the moduli space. for the purpose
of the bfss theory, one is interested only in very small energies. the o-diagonal
modes have much higher excitation energies and so are frozen into their ground states;
the associated zero-point uctuations are then not observable. roughly speaking,

tr(x nx n) = tr(x nx n)odiag./high energy + tr(x nx n)diag./low energy .

(7.11)

the o-diagonal part is much larger but is state-independent at low energy. in other
words, tr(x nx n) in the low energy theory diers from the full tr(x nx n) by an
additive renormalization. it seems hard to give a precise denition of the low energy
part in terms of the underlying qm variables.

in conclusion, to nd a description of the at 11-dimensional m-theory (or the
10-dimensional iib theory) we somehow need, in the large-n limit, to identify a
subtheory contained in the intersection of all the eld theory constructions. to nd
a description of the general background we need something which contains the union
of all the eld theory constructions.
