abstract

we study d = 4, n = 1, type iia orientifold with orbifold group zn and
zn  zm . we calculate one-loop vacuum amplitudes for klein bottle, cylinder
and mobius strip and extract the tadpole divergences. we nd that the tadpole

cancellation conditions thus obtained are satised by the z4, z8, z 
entifolds while there is no solution for z3, z7, z6, z 

12 ori-
6, z12. the z4  z4 type
iia orientifold is also constructed by introducing four dierent congurations of

8, z 

6-branes. we argue about perturbative versus non-perturbative orientifold vacua

under t-duality between the type iia and the type iib zn orientifolds in four

dimensions.

introduction

in the past years various dualities in ten dimensions among type iia, type iib, e8 e8
heterotic, spin(32)/z2 heterotic and type i superstring theories have been studied

extensively. most of these dualities are non-perturbative and often allow mapping non-

perturbative phenomena in one theory to perturbative phenomena in another theory

[1]. for example, type i vacua are supposed to be s-dual to strongly coupled so(32)

heterotic vacua and hence there is a hope to get information about non-perturbative

heterotic physics through the study on the type i vacua [2]. type i strings can be

understood as an orientifold of type iib closed strings with respect to the world-sheet

parity operation .

the type iia and type iib theories in d = 10 are t-dual each other with respect to

one compact dimension and these two theories are two limiting points in a continuous

moduli space of quantum vacua. the two heterotic theories are also t-dual each other,

though there are technical details involving wilson loops [3]. t-duality applied to the

type i theory gives a dual description, which is called type i. the type i theory is an

orientifold quotient of type iia theory with respect to the composition of world-sheet

parity  with the space reection r.

string vacua of type iib orientifolds in less than ten dimensions, especially in d = 6

[4, 5, 6] and d = 4 [7, 8, 9] have been studied by many authors. it was found that

d = 4, n = 1 type iib orientifolds have consistent string vacua for the orientifold

group z3, z7, z6, z 

12. in the heterotic
orbifolds, all these zn actions can give rise to consistent string vacua [10, 11] so that

6, z12, but they are not consistent for z4, z8, z 

8, z 

it seems puzzle that some of zn are not allowed in the type iib orientifolds. this

puzzle was studied by ref.[12]. according to their analysis, additional non-perturbative

sectors appear in the four-dimensional type iib z4, z8, z 

12 orientifolds and the naive
tadpole cancellation conditions are not necessarily satised. on the other hand, the

8, z 

type iib z3, z7, z6, z 
conditions although there are some subtleties in the z 

6, z12 orientifolds can obey the perturbative tadpole cancellation

6 case [12].

despite the extensive studies on the type iib orientifolds, d = 4, n = 1 type iia

orientifold models or the type i theory in four dimensions have not been constructed

explicitly. in this paper we undertake a systematic study of this class of orientifolds.

we present a detailed study of tadpole cancellation conditions for general d = 4,

1

type iia orientifolds and explicitly construct the massless spectrum of all possible zn

orientifolds with 6 branes sitting at the xed point at the origin. we nd that the

12 orientifolds, while the z3, z7,
6, z12 are not allowed. extension of our argument to zn  zm orientifolds is

tadpole cancellation conditions allow the z4, z8, z 
z6, z 
straightforward. as an example, we give the z4  z4 orientifold model.

8, z 

for the d6-brane conguration of the type iia orientifolds, each of the three com-

plex planes of the 6-d compact space has two target space coordinates where cor-

responding open string wave functions x (, ) have the neumann and the dirich-

let boundary conditions, respectively. these string wave functions with the dierent

boundary conditions are mixed under the zn orbifold action. then, zn invariance

requires that we should include the open string sectors with the mixed boundary con-

ditions which are neither neumann nor dirichlet. these open strings do not end on

d-branes and are not dealt with by a world-sheet, i.e., perturbative description within

the orientifold approach [12]. it is shown that for the z4, z8, z 

12 orientifolds, we can
eliminate mixed boundary conditions by choosing appropriate coordinate axes of the

8, z 

6-d compact space. thus, for these orientifolds, there are no non-perturbative states

in the above sense and they obey the perturbative tadpole cancellation conditions. on

the other hand, for the z3, z7, z6, z 

6, z12 orientifolds it is shown that we cannot elim-
inate mixed boundary conditions. therefore, these orientifolds may have additional

non-perturbative states from the open strings with mixed boundary conditions and do

not satisfy perturbative tadpole cancellation conditions.

this result is opposite of what was obtained in the d = 4 type iib orientifolds:

6, z12 and non-perturbative for z4, z8, z 

the four dimensional type iib orientifold vacua have a perturbative solution for z3,
z7, z6, z 
type iia orientifold vacua have a perturbative solution for z4, z8, z 
perturbative for z3, z7, z6, z 

12 [12]. on the other hand,
12, while non-
6, z12. we expect that d = 4, n = 1 type iia orientifold
is t-dual to d = 4, n = 1 type iib orientifold with respect to x5, x7, x9 directions of

8, z 

8, z 

the 6-d orbifold space. what we nd is that the perturbative (non-perturbative) vacua

of the d = 4 type iia orientifolds are changed to the non-perturbative (perturbative)

vacua of the d = 4 type iib orientifolds under the t-dual transformation.

the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we summarize

how to construct type iia orientifolds in four dimensions. this is a straightforward

extension of the method to construct type iib orientifolds. in section 3 we calculate

2

the one-loop vacuum amplitudes and extract the tadpole divergences. the tadpole

cancellation conditions are examined in section 4 for possible zn which acts crystal-
lographically on a t 6 lattice and lead to n = 1 supersymmetry. as advertised we

nd the perturbative solution for z4, z8, z 
conditions are not satised for z3, z7, z6, z 

8, z 
12, while the naive tadpole cancellation
6, z12. in section 5 we discuss our result
in the light of t-dualities. we argue that the four-dimensional type iia orientifolds

for z3, z7, z6, z 

6, z12 have open strings with the mixed boundary conditions which
produce the non-perturbative sector. this could be the reason why the naive tadpole

cancellation conditions are not satised by the z3, z7, z6, z 

6, z12 models. finally, in
appendix we give the details of the calculation for one-loop vacuum amplitudes of the

d = 4 type iia orientifolds for klein bottle, cylinder and mobius strip surfaces.

2 d=4, n=1, type iia orientifolds

in this section we summarize the basic ingredients and notation needed in the con-

struction of d = 4, n = 1 type iia orientifolds. the argument is parallel with the

type iib orientifold [5, 8]. in the type iia string theory the complete orientifold group
is written as g1 + rg2 with rgrg  g1 for g, g  g2 [5].  is the world-sheet
parity transformation that exchanges left and right world sheet movers. r is exchange
x5  x5, x7  x7, x9  x9, and we are concerned with g1 = g2 and g1 = zn
or g1 = zn  zm action on t 6 in the type iia string theory.

the zn orbifold action is realized by powers of the twist generator (n = 1) which

is written in the form

 = exp(2i(v1j45 + v2j67 + v3j89)),

(2.1)

where jmn are so(6) cartan generators. a twist vector v = (v1, v2, v3) associated with
 obeys v1v2v3 = 0 for some choice of signs in order to realize n = 1 supersymmetry
[10]. in terms of the complex bosonic coordinates y1 = x4 + ix5, y2 = x6 + ix7, y3 =
x8 + ix9 and y1 = x4  ix5 etc..  acts diagonally as

kyi = e2ikviyi,

(2.2)

and r acts as ryi = yi. similarly, we dene complex fermionic elds 1 = 4 + i5,
etc..

to derive the massless spectra we will work in the light-cone gauge. the neveu-

where  denotes uncompactied dimensions. the massless ramond (r) states are of
the form |s0s1s2s3i with s0, si =  1
2 and the gso projection leads to an odd number
of minus signs in the right-moving states and an even number of minus signs in the

left-moving states or vice versa. these transform as

k|s0s1s2s3i = e2ikvs|s0s1s2s3i.

(2.5)

the zn actions that can act crystallographically on a t 6 lattice and lead to n = 1

supersymmetry were classied in [10]. the list of possible zn with corresponding twist

vectors is given in table 1.

although type iia is a theory of closed strings, the orientifold projection requires

both closed and open string sectors. tadpole divergences are found in the partition

function of the closed sector klein bottle surface. to cancel these tadpoles, new con-

tribution must be included [13].

introduction of open strings leads to the required

cancellation for a specic structure of chan-paton charges. tadpole cancellation is

achieved by including the right number of dp-branes [14]. an open string has one end,

labeled by a, on a dp-brane and the other end, labeled by b, on a dq-brane. they give

rise to pq string sectors. the labels a, b correspond to the chan-paton factors at each

end of the string.

the spectrum in the closed sector is obtained from those of the type iia orbifold

states invariant under r transformation. orbifold states are constructed by coupling

left and right moving states of opposite chirality to be invariant under the orbifold
group action. the massless left ns states correspond to vector matters 
2|0i and to

scalars acquire a phase e2ikvi. right movers are obtained by replacing   .

2|0i. vectors are invariant under the orbifold twist  action while

 1

the type of d-branes present in the open string sector depends on the content of

the orientifold group. for g1 = g2, the identity is in g2 so that the orientifold group

contains r as an element. since r is an order two element acting on x5, x7, x9,

there will be d6-branes which extend in d = 4 space-time plus x4, x6, x8 directions

and have the dirichlet(d) condition in x5, x7, x9. furthermore, when g1 = g2 = zn

with n = even, the zn action in table 1 contains order two element r3 acting on

the two complex directions transverse to y3. then the orientifold group contains an
action of the type rr3 and there is another d6-branes denoted by d63 (or d6)-

branes, which extend in d = 4 space-time plus x5, x7, x8 directions and have the

d condition in x4, x6, x9. in what follows we consider mainly 63-branes so that we
denote it as 6-branes. if we consider zn  zm with twist vectors v = 1
n (1,1, 0)
and v = 1
m (0, 1,1), there is a set of 61, 62, 63-branes where 61-branes have the d
condition in x5, x6, x8 directions and 62-branes have the d condition for x4, x7, x8.
open string states are denoted by |, abi, where  refers to world-sheet degrees
of freedom while the chan-paton indices a, b are associated to the string endpoints

on dp-branes and dq-branes. a pair of chan-paton labels must be contracted with a

hermitian matrix ab.

the action of a group element g  g1 is given by

g : |, abi  (g,p)aa|g, abi(1

g,q )bb,

(2.6)

where g,p and g,q are unitary matrices associated to g. the action of rg with
g  g2, is given by

rg : |, abi  (rg,p)aa|g, bai(1

rg,q)bb.

rg,p is dened as

rg,p = g,pr,p = g,pr,p,p.

(2.7)

(2.8)

matrices r,p and rg,p are unitary. for k  zn we abbreviate k,p as k,p and
rk,p as rk,p. since rk(r)1 = n k so that (rk)2 = 1, eq.(2.7) leads

1
rk,pt

rk,p = 1,

(2.9)

then

t
rk,p = rk,p.

(2.10)

consistency with the orientifold group multiplication law implies several constraints

on the  matrices. without loss of generality we can choose 0,p = 1 and

k,p = k

1,p,

n
1,p = 1.

(2.11)

cancellation of tadpoles imposes further conditions on the  matrices. for example,
as will be shown in sec.4, it turns out that the  matrices are 32  32 and obey the
following relations [5],

t
r,6 = r,6,

t
r,6 = r,6.

(2.12)

the open string spectrum is computed once the  matrices are found. according

to the end point there are various pq sectors. here we will concentrate on models

containing 6-and 6-branes, located on the xed point corresponding to the origin in

the compact space.

in this conguration one gets maximal gauge symmetry. we

describe the massless bosonic states in each pq sector. for 66- or 66-states, massless
ns states include gauge bosons

ab . the
invariance under the orientifold group action (2.6) and (2.7) leads to the constraints

on the chan-paton matrices as

(0) = 1,6(0)1
1,6
(i) = e2ivi1,6(i)1

for 66-states. as for 66-states, we have

(0) = 1,6(0)1
1,6
(3) = e2ivi1,6(3)1

(2.15)

in eq.(2.13)-eq.(2.15), the sign in the r projection is determined as follows [5]:
for the 66- or 66-sector, the massless states with vertex operator tx  for  parallel
to the brane has  = 1, and the states with nx  for  perpendicular has  = +1.
thus r = 1 for  = 2, 3 and  = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or i = 1, 2, 3 in the 66-states. for

6

the 66-states, r = +1 for  = 4, 5, 6, 7, or i = 1, 2 and r = 1 for  = 8, 9, or
i = 3.

next let us consider the 66 states. in this case x4, x5, x6, x7 obey dn boundary

conditions and have expansions with half-integer moded creation operators. by world-

sheet supersymmetry their fermionic partners in the ns sector are integer moded. their
zero modes span a representation of a cliord algebra and are labeled as |sj, ski, j, k =
1, 2 with sj, sk =  1
2 . under ,|sj, ski picks up a phase e2i(vj sj+vksk). hence, for these
states we have

 = e2i(vj sj+vksk)1,61
1,6.

(2.16)

the 66 sectors are related to 66 by  so that we have no extra constraints on  in the

66 sectors.

now let us consider how to extract spectrum of the 66-states. since r,6 are
symmetric from eq.(2.12), the constraints on (0) and (i) under r in eq.(2.13)

implies that (0) and (i) are so(32) generators. they can be organized into charged
generators a = ea, a = 1,   , 480, and cartan generators i = hi, i = 1,   , 16 such
that

[hi, ea] = a

i ea,

(2.17)

1,   , a

where (a
16) is the 16-dimensional root vector associated to the generator ea.
these vectors are of the form (1,1, 0,   , 0), where underlining indicates that all
possible permutations must be considered.

the 1,6 and its powers represent the action of zn group on chan-paton factors,

and they correspond to elements of a discrete subgroup of the abelian group spanned

by the cartan generators. we can write

1,6 = e2iv66 h.

(2.18)

this equation denes the 16-dimensional shift vector v66. gauge bosons are selected

by the rst condition of eq.(2.13). they are given by

a  v66 = 0 mod z,

(2.19)

which select the subgroup of so(32) [8]. matter states are selected by the equation

for (i) in eq.(2.13) and are given by

a  v66 = vi mod z.

7

(2.20)

for the 66 sector, r,6 is antisymmetric from eq.(2.12). then (0) and (3) are

sp(32) generators which are associated with the same so root vectors given before
plus long roots (2, 0,   , 0). on the other hand, (j), j = 1, 2 are so(32) generators
due to eq.(2.15). the 1,6 is expressed as eq.(2.18) with the shift vector v66. then

the gauge symmetry and spectra of matter states are determined by the same form of

eqs.(2.19) and (2.20) for v66, respectively.

for the 66 sector, we have generators acting simultaneously on both 6-branes and

6-branes. for the ground states |sj, ski, the roots of the generators are given by

66 = (1, 0,   , 0;1, 0,   , 0),

(2.21)

where the rst 16 components transform under so(32) of 6-branes and second 16

components transform under so(32) of 6-branes. the shift in this sector is dened to
be v66 = v66  v66. massless states of the 66 sector are determined by eq.(2.16) and
are given by

66  v66 = (sjvj + skvk) mod z,

(2.22)

with sj, sk =  1
sponds to antiparticles.

3 tadpoles

in the orientifold theory the one-loop vacuum amplitudes include the torus, the klein
bottle(k), the mobius strip(m), and the cylinder(c). the last three have tadpole
divergences from exchange of massless states in the closed string channels. by super-

symmetry the total divergences vanish but consistency requires separate cancellation

of ns-ns and r-r tadpoles [13]. for d = 4, n = 1,type iib orientifold, tadpole can-

cellation conditions have been studied in refs.[7, 8]. in this section we summarize the

result of the calculation for the tadpoles of the type iia zn orientifolds. details are

given in the appendix.

rke2t[l0(n)+ l0(n)]
 .

(3.2)

here l0(n) and l0(n) are the virasoro operators from left-moving and right-moving
modes in the twisted sector n, respectively. f ( f ) is the left (right)-moving world-sheet

fermion number. since in the type iia theory ramond states have opposite chirality
in left- and right-moving sectors, the sign in front of (1) f is + for the ns sector and
 for the ramond sector. v4 denotes the regularized 4-d space-time volume.

the trace in zk is computed in a standard way. since r exchanges the n-twisted

sector with itself, i.e.,

rl0(n)(r)1 = l0(n)

(3.3)

and similarly for l0(n), the n-twisted sector survives the trace, in general. the
divergences of interest are produced by the t  0 limit. for the untwisted (n = 0)
sector, we obtain

for the twisted sector, it turns out that

zk(n, k) = zk(n n, k),

(3.5)

so that the twisted sectors give no contribution to the klein bottle amplitude (3.1).

(trk,6,i)2,

(3.9)

where lmi = (l5, l7, l8) and li = (l4, l6, l9). this is due to the fact that the
66-states have nn boundary conditions for  = 5, 7, 8 directions and dd boundary

conditions for  = 4, 6, 9 directions. in the product with respect to j, pj is given such

that pj < kvj < pj + 1, pj = integer. other notations are the same as z66.

next, let us consider z66. the 66-states have the dn boundary conditions for

 = 4, 5, 6, 7 directions and the nn boundary condition @for  = 8 and the dd
boundary condition for  = 9. the t  0 limit of z66 vanishes for kvi = integer,

where n = integer and loi = (l5, l7), lei = (l4, l6). for other kvj, i.e., kv3 = half
integer and/or kv1,2 = integer, we have z6(k)  (1  1)0.

4 models

in this section we study the type iia orientifolds based on t 6/{r, g} where g denotes
generators of a discrete group. let us consider g = zn since generalization to g =
zn  zm is straightforward. there are 6-branes for all n and in addition there are
6-branes for even n. here we concentrate on models with all the branes located on

the particular xed point corresponding to the origin in the compact space. in this

conguration one gets maximal gauge symmetry.

the various tadpole divergences can be classied according to their volume depen-

dence. to extract the divergences in the various type of amplitudes, we have to make

the change of variables, since the loop modulus t is related to the cylinder length 

dierently for each surface as follows:

klein bottle : t =

1

, cylinder : t =

1
2

, mobius : t =

.

(4.1)

first, let us consider zn with n = odd. in the k amplitude, eq.(3.4) shows that
zk(1, 1) has tadpole singularity proportional to l4l6l8/l5l7l9. taking into account
the z66(1) in c66 and the z6(1) in m6 which are given by eq.(3.8) and eq.(3.14),

respectively, the total amplitude for large  is given by

(4.2)

since 0,6 = 1, so tr(0,6) = n6 and n6 stands for the number of 6-branes. then tadpole

divergences are canceled if n6 = 32 and

r,6 = t

r,6.

(4.3)

gence which arises from zk(1, n

for zn with n = even, the klein bottle amplitude k has additional tadpole diver-
2 ). this divergence is proportional to l5l7l8/l4l6l9.
for n = even, there are 6-branes and this type of divergence will be canceled by the
divergences which arise from z6( n
2 ) in m6 and the z66(1) in c66. in fact, for the
twist vectors given in table 1, the divergent part of the total amplitude is proportional

to

2 ,6t

(4.5)

the action of r on the 66, 66 and 66 sectors can be analyzed in much the

same way as in the type iib theory for . following the analysis given by gimon

and polchinski (gp) [5], we can show that (r)2 = 1 on 66 and 66 states, whereas
(r)2 = 1 on 66 states. then eq.(4.3) implies
r,6 = t

r,6.

(4.6)

since the matrix 1,p and its powers k,p represent the action of the zn group

on chan-paton factors, they can be expressed by the diagonal matrices. taking into

account eqs.(2.8), (2.10) and eqs.(4.3), (4.6), we can derive the following relations,

t
rk,p = prk,p
t
rk,p = (1)kprk,p

if

[1,p, r,p] = 0,

if {1,p, r,p} = 0,

(4.7)

(4.8)

where p = 1 for p = 6 and p = 1 for p = 6. equation (4.8) holds for even n.

12

now that we have prepared necessary ingredients to study the zn models, we now

consider each orientifold in detail.

(1) z3 and z7

possible zn models with n = odd are z3 and z7. we consider here the models

in which all 6-branes sit at the origin in the compact space. as expressed in eq.(4.2),
tadpole divergences in the klein bottle amplitude k are canceled by the divergences
in the cylinder amplitude c66 and the mobius strip amplitude m6 with introducing 32
6-branes.

there remain, however, extra divergences in the cylinder amplitude z66(k) and the
mobius strip amplitude z6(k), where k = 1, 2 for z3 and k = 1,   , 6 for z7. using
eq.(3.8) and eq.(3.14), we nd that they contribute to the coecient of the divergent

part as follows:

for z3 and

for z7.

xk=1,,6h(trk,6)2  8tr(1

rk,6t

rk,6)i ,

rk,6t

rk,6)i ,

(4.9)

(4.10)

let us rst consider z3. taking into account eq.(4.7), we nd the following condi-

tion to cancel the tadpole divergences,

xk=1,2

(trk,6)2 = 2  162.

(4.11)

since k,6 = k

1,6 and 1,6 is 32  32 diagonal matrix with 3

1,6 = 1, we nd that there

is no such k,6 which obeys eq.(4.11).

the condition of tadpole cancellation for the z7 orientifold amounts to

xk=1,,6

(trk,6)2 = 6  162.

(4.12)

in general, the diagonal element ii of 1,p is e2ik/n for n
1,p = 1, and ei(2k+1)/n for
n
1,p = 1, where k = 1,   , n. it turns out that under this restriction there is no k,6
which satises eq.(4.12).

(2) z4

this type of orientifold has 32 6-branes and 32 6-branes. tadpole divergences pro-

portional to l4l6l8/l5l7l9 and l5l7l8/l4l6l9 are removed by the conditions given

13

by eq.(4.3) and eq.(4.5). in addition, there are tadpole divergences which arise from
zpq(2), p, q = 6, 6 and are proportional to l8/l9. the condition for the cancellation

of the divergent part is given by

2(tr2,6)2 + 2(tr2,6)2 + tr2,6tr2,6 = 0.

(4.13)

further divergences come from zpq(k) where p, q = 6, 6 and k = 1, 3. these contri-

butions are canceled provided that

xk=1,3n(trk,6)2 + (trk,6)2 + (trk,6)(trk,6)o = 0.

equations (4.13) and (4.14) are satised by the following  matrices:

1,6 = 1,6 = diag(i8,i4, i4, 3i8,i4, i4),

(4.14)

(4.15)

where  = e2i/4 and im stands for the m dimensional unit matrix. in fact, for these

 matrices we have

trk,6 = trk,6 = 0, k = 1, 2, 3

(4.16)

so that eqs.(4.13) and (4.14) are satised trivially.@

the 1,p, p = 6, 6 is expressed as eq.(2.18) in terms of cartan generators hi.
since cartan generators are represented by 2 2 3 submatrices, eq.(4.15) denes the
following 16-dimensional shift vector,

gauge symmetry is selected by the root vectors a which obey the condition (2.19).
we nd a [u(8)  so(8)  so(8)] group from 6-branes and [u(8)  sp(8)  sp(8)]
from 6-branes.

charged chiral states from the 66 sector are given by eq.(2.20). we nd the fol-

lowing 66 matter states,

2 (8, 1, 8; 1, 1, 1), 2 (8, 8, 1; 1, 1, 1),

(1, 8, 8; 1, 1, 1)

(28, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1),

(28, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1)

(4.18)

where the rst three entries of the parentheses stand for representations with respect
to u(8) so(8) so(8) from 6-branes and the last three are for u(8) sp(8) sp(8)

14

from 6-branes. in the same way, we obtain the 66 matter states as follows.

2 (1, 1, 1; 8, 1, 8), 2 (1, 1, 1; 8, 8, 1),

(1, 1, 1; 1, 8, 8)

(1, 1, 1; 28, 1, 1),

(1, 1, 1; 8, 1, 1),

(1, 1, 1; 28, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 1; 8, 1, 1)

finally, the 66 matter states are obtained by the condition (2.22) as

(8, 1, 1; 1, 1, 8),
(1, 8, 1; 8, 1, 1),

(1, 1, 8; 8, 1, 1)
(8, 1, 1; 1, 8, 1)

(4.19)

(4.20)

(3) z8

in this case there are tadpole divergences proportional to l8/l9 which are from
zpq(k) with p, q = 6, 6; k = 2, 4, 6 and zp(k) with p = 6, 6; k = 2, 6. cancellation of

the divergent part gives the following condition.

rk,6)o = 0.

(4.21)

there are also tadpole divergences from zpq(k) with p, q = 6, 6; k = 1, 3, 5, 7. cancel-

lation of these divergences gives the following condition,

xp=6,6 xk=1,3,5,7

(trk,p)2 

(trk,6)(trk,6)

2 xk=1,7
+ 2 xk=3,5

(trk,6)(trk,6) = 0.

(4.22)

taking into account eq.(4.7) and eq.(4.8) in eq.(4.21), these two conditions of

tadpole cancellation are satised by the  matrices obeying

trk,6 = 0 (k 6= 4), tr4,6 = 32, trk,6 = 0

(4.23)

or the relations obtained by exchanging 6  6. the solution of eq.(4.23) is given by

1,6 = diag(ii8,i4, i4, ,ii8,i4, i4),
1,6 = diag(i4, 2i4, 3i4,i2, i2, 7i4, 6i4, 5i4,i2, i2),

(4.24)

where  = e2i/8.

(4) z

in this orientifold model there are tadpole divergences from zpq(4), p, q = 6, 6,

which are proportional to l8/l9. cancellation of these divergences requires the follow-

ing condition,

2(tr4,6)2 + 2(tr4,6)2 + (tr4,6)(tr4,6) = 0.

(4.30)

other divergences arise from zpq(k), p, q = 6, 6; k = 1,   , 7(k 6= 4) and zp(k), p =

the remaining zn orientifold, i.e., z6, z 

6 and z12 are studied in a similar way. it
turns out that tadpoles of these orientifolds cannot be canceled by simply introducing

6- and 6-branes.
(6) z4  z4
we consider z4z4 with the twist vectors v = 1

4(0, 1,1). as
noted in sec.2 there is a set of 61, 62, 63-branes, where 61-branes have the d condition

4(1,1, 0) and v = 1

for x5, x6, x8 and 62-branes have the d condition for x4, x7, x8. the 63-branes are de-
noted by 6-branes up till now. the tadpole singularity proportional to l4l6l8/l5l7l9

is canceled by introducing 6-branes and the one proportional to l5l7l8/l4l6l9 is

canceled by 63-branes as usual. the new feature is the appearance of the divergences

proportional to l4l7l9/l5l6l8 and l5l6l9/l4l7l8. these divergences are canceled

by 61 and 62-branes, respectively.

the divergences from the cylinder and mobius strip amplitudes are canceled by

taking the following  matrices.

the gauge symmetry of this orientifold is determined by   v = 0 mod z, where  is
the root vectors of so(32) for 6-branes and sp(32) for 61,2,3-branes. using the shift

vectors given by eq.(4.49), we obtain the gauge group of the z4  z4 orientifold as
follows,

so(8)4  sp(4)8  u(4)6  u(2)4,

(4.50)

where so(8)4 comes from 6-branes, sp(4)4  u(4)2 is from 63-branes, u(4)2  u(2)4
is from 61-branes and sp(4)4  u(4)2 comes from 62-branes.

5 discussions

we have constructed the d = 4, n = 1, type iia orientifolds for zn that act crystallo-
graphically on a t 6 lattice. we found that among the possible zn , z4, z8, z 
8, z 
12
are consistent orientifolds while z3, z7, z6, z 
12 are inconsistent due to the im-
possibility of tadpole cancellation. this result is reverse to what was obtained in

6, z 

d = 4, n = 1 type iib orientifolds, where z3, z7, z6, z 
orientifolds but z4, z8, z 
plitude for z4, z8, z 

12 are consistent type iib
12 are not. in type iib orientifolds, the klein bottle am-
12 has divergences proportional to v4/l8l9 that cannot be can-
celed against any of the mobius strip or cylinder contributions [8]. on the other hand,

6, z 

8, z 

8, z 

in type iia orientifolds all divergences in the klein bottle amplitude are canceled by

introducing 32 6- and 6-branes and there is no further divergence in this amplitude.

the dierent behavior of the type iia and type iib klein bottle amplitudes for
t  0 is due to the dierence of the boundary conditions in the closed string sector.
for type iib closed strings, the orbifold action  acts on the  invariant states as

ky y |0i = e4ikviy y |0i.

(5.1)

on the other hand,  acts on the r invariant states of type iia closed strings as

ky y |0i = y y |0i.

(5.2)

thus the type iia klein bottle amplitude behaves as eq.(3.4) or eq.(3.5), hence it
does not give tadpole divergence if 2kvi 6= integer. when 2kvi = integer, the divergent
contribution from the tadpole diagram is canceled by introducing 6-/6-branes.

therefore, in the type iia orientifolds extra divergences which arise from the mobius

strip and cylinder amplitudes must be canceled by themselves. as explained in sec.4,

this cancellation is impossible for z3 and z7. for other orientifolds, i.e., z6, z 

6, z12, sim-
ilar analysis shows that the tadpole divergences are not canceled. for example, in the z6

orientifold there are tadpole divergences from the cylinder amplitudes, z66(3), z66(3)
and z66(3) which are proportional to l8/l9. the cancellation condition is given by

2(tr3,6)2 + 2(tr3,6)2 + tr3,6tr3,6 = 0.

(5.3)

there are also tadpole divergences from zpq(k), zp(k), p, q = 6, 6 and k = 1, 2, 4, 5

which have no six dimensional compact volume dependence. the cancellation condition

for these divergences amount to

 xk=1,5(cid:20) 1

(5.4)

2 xk=1,2,4,5

it turns out that there are no 1,6 and 1,6 which satisfy these tadpole cancellation

conditions.

let us consider the impossibility of tadpole cancellation for z3, z7, z6, z 

12 from
a somewhat dierent viewpoint. in the type iia zn orientifolds with 6- and 6-brane

6, z 

conguration, each complex plane has two target space coordinates and the correspond-

ing string wave functions have the neumann and the dirichlet boundary conditions.

in fact, 6-branes have the neumann condition for x4, x6, x8 and the dirichlet condi-
tion for x5, x7, x9. as for 6-branes, they have the neumann condition for x5, x7, x8

and the dirichlet condition for x4, x6, x9. so, each complex plane yi has the string

wave functions with the neumann and the dirichlet conditions. under the zn rota-

tion, these two string wave functions with the dierent boundary conditions are mixed.

however, by rotating the coordinate axes we can redene the zn action as

 = exp(2i(v

1j46 + v

2j57 + v3j89))

= u exp(2i(v1j45 + v2j67 + v3j89))u 1,

(5.5)

where u is an appropriate so(6) transformation. then  acts diagonally on y 

1 =
1 plane have the
same type of the boundary condition. similar situation holds for x5 and x7 in the

2 = x5 + ix7. this time, both x4 and x6 in the y 

x4 + ix6 and y 

y 
2 plane. in this way we can rearrange the two complex planes such that there is no
mixing between the neumann and the dirichlet conditions under the  rotation.

21

cos 2kv3  sin 2kv3

sin 2kv3














(5.7)

for the third plane y3, however, we cannot get rid of the mixing of the two boundary

conditions as we show in the following. brane congurations of the zn orientifold
should be invariant under the zn rotation. in particular, under y 

3 = exp(2ikv3)y3

(

x 

8, 

 x 

9) = (x8,  x9),

(5.6)

so that the neumann condition x8 = 
8 = 0 and the dirichlet condition  x9 =

 x 
9 = 0 at ,  = 0,  are kept invariant under the zn rotation of the 8-9 plane.
this implies that the world-sheet coordinates must be transformed under zn in such

x 

a way as

then, consistency with the zn invariance requires that the open strings with the

rotated boundary conditions should be included. the rotated boundary conditions are

written by

cos 2kv3x8  sin 2kv3 x8 = 0,
cos 2kv3 x9 + sin 2kv3x9 = 0,

(5.8)

(5.9)

at  = 0, . when 2kv3 = integer, eq.(5.8) reduces to the neumann condition while

eq.(5.9) gives the dirichlet condition. when 2kv3 = half integer, eq.(5.8) reduces

to the dirichlet condition and eq.(5.9) turns out to the neumann condition. for
4kv3 6= integer, we obtain the mixed boundary condition which is neither neumann
nor dirichlet.

appearance of the sectors with the mixed boundary conditions or twisted open

strings in the type iib superstring has been discussed in refs.[12, 16]. as in the type

iib orientifolds, the open strings with mixed boundary conditions do not end on the

d-branes. the endpoint of such open strings is not stuck on a rigid manifold but rather

it harmonically oscillates around a xed point. there is no consistent world-sheet, i.e.,

perturbative description of these phenomena within the orientifold approach [12].

the type iia orientifolds of z3, z7, z6, z12 have the twist vector with 4kv3 6= inte-
ger for k 6= 0, n
2 and they have open strings with the mixed boundary condition. so
we expect that although tadpole cancellation conditions are not satised by these ori-

entifolds perturbatively, there may be additional non-perturbative contributions from

these open strings. for z 

6, a little bit careful analysis is needed. since v2 =  1

2 in this

22

model, we change the coordinate axes such that

 = exp(2i(v

1j48 + v2j67 + v

3j59))

(5.10)

for this choice of the axes, the 6-brane conguration has the neumann condition in

the 4-8 plane and the dirichlet condition in the 5-9 plane. on the other hand, the

6-brane conguration has the mixed boundary condition in the 4-8 and 5-9 planes.

it is impossible to choose coordinate axes to eliminate mixed boundary conditions for

both 6- and 6-branes simultaneously. thus the z 

6 orientifolds have non-perturbative

sectors and do not satisfy the perturbative tadpole cancellation condition.

for the type iia orientifolds of z4, z8, z 

12, the twist vectors obey 2v3 = integer
or half-integer so that the boundary conditions (5.8) and (5.9) are the neumann or the

8, z 

dirichlet. thus we can always choose the coordinate axes so as to eliminate the mixed

boundary conditions and these orientifolds obey the perturbative tadpole cancellation

conditions.

to summarize we have derived the tadpole cancellation conditions for the type iia

8, z 

zn orientifolds and found that the z4, z8, z 
12 orientifolds satisfy the tadpole can-
cellation conditions while the z3, z7, z6, z 
6, z12 orientifolds do not. in table 2 we sum-
marize the gauge group and charged chiral multiplets of the z4, z8, z 
12 orientifolds.
extension of our argument to zn  zm orientifolds is straightforward and we gave
an example of the z4  z4 orientifold. we have argued that for the z3, z7, z6, z 
6, z12
orientifolds, there exist open strings with the mixed boundary conditions and their

8, z 

end-points are not d-branes but some non-perturbative objects. appearance of the

non-perturbative sector could be the reason why these orientifolds do not obey the

tadpole cancellation conditions obtained perturbatively. this result is just opposite

of what was obtained in the type iib orientifolds, where the z3, z7, z6, z 
tifolds obey the perturbative tadpole cancellation conditions while the z4, z8, z 

6, z12 orien-
8, z 
12
orientifolds do not. here, the latter orientifolds have the non-perturbative sector from

the open strings with the mixed boundary conditions [12]. this implies that the per-

turbatively consistent vacua are changed into the non-perturbative vacua under the

t-duality between the type iia and the type iib orientifolds in four dimensions.

a appendix

one-loop amplitudes of the type iia orientifolds

in this appendix we give the detailed expression for the one-loop amplitudes of the

klein bottle(k), the mobius strip(m), and the cylinder(c).

(1) klein bottle amplitude
the klein bottle amplitude is given by eqs.(3.1) and (3.2), where l0(n) and l0(n)

are dened by

l0(n) = 1
l0(n) = 1

2( p

2  l)2 + n(n) + 1
2 + l)2 + n(n) + 1

(a.1)

where p is an uncompactied four-dimensional momentum and p, l are compacti-
ed internal momenta and windings. n(n) and n(n) are the oscillator part of the

left-moving and right-moving hamiltonian, respectively. a(a) is a left (right)-moving

normal-ordering constant.

the trace in zk is computed in a standard way. at rst we represent l0(n) =

l1 + l2 + l3 where

l1 =

 , l2 = n(n) + a, l3 =
p 2

(

(a.2)

and similarly for l0(n). then we nd that the contribution of l1 and l1 is given by
(a.3)

k (n, k) =

z (1)

(22t)2 ,

as for l2 and l2 there are contributions from both the untwisted sector(n = 0) and
the twisted sector(n 6= 0). for the untwisted sector we obtain

here q = e2t and ,  indicate functions of q = q2 = e4t instead of q. in deriving

eq.(a.4) we have used the riemann identities for the  functions [15]. to extract the

25

divergences, we take the limit t  0 and obtain

thus the twisted sectors do not contribute to the amplitude.
for l3 and l3, we put p = n/r0, l = mr0,  = 2r2

0, where r0 is a common

radius of the compact space. when kvi=integer, the state |n, mi transforms as

rk|n, mi = (|  n, mi

transforms as

the 66-states have dn boundary conditions for  = 4, 5, 6, 7 and nn boundary

when kv3 = integer, the part which contains kv3 should be replaced with (4t)(1)kv3.
furthermore, when 2kvi = 2n + 1, n = 0, 1,   , the part which contains kvi, i = 1, 2
should be replaced with (4t)(1)n+1.

next we compute the contribution of l3 to zp(k). mobius 6-states have nn
boundary conditions for  = 4, 6, 8 and dd boundary conditions for  = 5, 7, 9. when
kvi =integer, |n, mi transforms as eq.(a.9) and z (3)

6 (k) reads

when kvi =half integer, |n, mi transforms as eq.(a.11). but mobius 6-states have no
winding (m = 0) for  = 4, 6, 8 and no momentum (n = 0) for  = 5, 7, 9. so they
have no contribution to z (3)

6 (k) .

mobius 6-states have nn boundary conditions for  = 5, 7, 8 and dd boundary

conditions for  = 4, 6, 9. when kv3 = integer, a sum over quantized momenta in  = 8

and a sum over windings in  = 9 contribute to the amplitude. thus, for kv3 =integer,

we obtain

when kvi = half integer for i = 1, 2, a sum of quantized momenta contributes in

 = 5, 7, while a sum of windings contributes in  = 4, 6. so, if kvi = half integer for

i = 1, 2, we have
