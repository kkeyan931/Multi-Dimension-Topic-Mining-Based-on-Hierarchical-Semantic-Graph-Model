abstract: we construct iib supergravity (viewed as dilatonic gravity) background
with non-trivial dilaton and with curved four-dimensional space. such background
describes the strong coupling regime of non-susy gauge theory with (power-like)
running gauge coupling which depends on curvature. we also speculate on such run-
ning as caused by ads time. curvature dependent quark-antiquark potential is
calculated where geometry type (de sitter or hyperbolic) predicts (or not) the conne-
ment. generalization of such background (susy or non-susy) with non-constant
axion is presented. quark-antiquark potential being again curvature-dependent may
produce the standard area law for large separations. it is interesting that de sitter
universe with axion supports the connement.

ads/cft correspondence [1] may provide new insights to the understanding of non-
perturbative qcd. for example, in frames of type 0 string theory the attempts[2]
have been done to reproduce such well-known qcd eects as running gauge coupling
and possibly connement. it is among the rst problems to get the description of
well-known qcd phenomena from bulk/boundary correspondence.

in another approach one can consider iib supergravity vacuum which describes
the strong coupling regime of a non-susy gauge theory. this can be achieved by
the consideration of deformed iib sg vacuums, for an example, with non-constant
dilaton which breaks conformal invariance and supersymmetry of boundary super
ym. such background will be the perturbation of ads5s5 vacuum. the background
of such sort (with non-trivial dilaton) which interpolates between ads (uv) and
at space with singular dilaton (ir) has been found in ref.[3] where also conformal
dimensions for (dilaton coupled) scalar have been found.

this solution of iib sg [3] has been used in ref.[4] with the interpretation of it
as the one describing the running gauge coupling (via exponent of dilaton). it has
been shown that running gauge coupling has a power law behaviour with uv-stable
xed point and quark-antiquark potential[5] has been calculated. qcd properties of
such background have been discussed in detail in refs.[6]. modications of iib sg
solution with non-constant dilaton [3] due to presence of axion[7], constant self-dual
vector[8] or world volume scalar [9] give further proof of the possible connement
and asymptotic freedom of the boundary non-susy gauge theory.

in the present paper we continue the study of running gauge coupling and con-
nement from iib supergravity backgrounds with non-trivial dilaton. we generalize
the solution of ref.[3] for non-zero curvature of d-dimensional space. as a result, iib
supergravity background is changing drastically. the running gauge coupling de-
pends explicitly on the four-dimensional curvature. the structure of quark-antiquark
potential is modied. in a sense, connement becomes the characteristic of the uni-
verse.

the work is organised as follows.

in the next section we give iib supergrav-
ity background with non-constant dilaton and non-at four-dimensional space. via
ads/cft it gives the curvature dependent (power-like) running gauge coupling and
quark-antiquark potential where hyperbolic geometry supports connement. section
3 is devoted to speculation related with the interpretation of running gauge coupling
as the one depending from ads time. in section 4 we generalize the background of
section 2 for the case when axion presents. (curvature dependent) quark-antiquark
potential is found.
it is shown that inationary universe (de sitter) with axion
predicts connement. some outlook is given in the last section.

2. solution, running gauge coupling and quark-antiquark

potential

we start from the following action of dilatonic gravity in d + 1 dimensions:

s = 

1

16g z dd+1xg (r    g ) .

(2.1)

in the following, we assume 2   and  to be positive. the action (2.1) is very
it contains the eective action of type iib string theory. the type iib
general.
supergravity, which is the low energy eective action of the type iib string theory,
has a vacuum with only non-zero metric and the anti-self-dual ve-form. the latter
is given by the freund-rubin-type ansatz:

f = 
fijkpq = 


2  , , ,   = 0, 1,   , 4

i, j,   = 5,   , 9 .
2 ijkpq ,

(2.2)

the vacuum has the topology of ads5  s5. since ads5 has a four dimensional
minkowski space as a subspace, especially on its boundary, ads5 has the four di-
mensional poincare symmetry iso(1, 3). s5 has, of course, so(6) symmetry.

as an extension, we can consider the solution where the dilaton is non-trivial
but the anti-self-dual ve-form is the same as in (2.2). furthermore if we require
the solution has the symmetry of iso(1, 3)  so(6), the metric should have the
following form:

ds2 = gdxdx + gmndxmdxn

(2.3)

2

where gmn is the metric of s5 and ref.[3]

g dxdx = f (y)dy2 + y

d1

xi,j=0

ijdxidxj .

(2.4)

in order to keep the symmetry of iso(1, 3)  so(6), the dilaton eld  can only
depend on y. then by integrating ve coordinates on s5, we obtain the eective ve
dimensional theory, which corresponds to d = 4 and  = 1
2 case in (2.1). we keep
working with above dilatonic gravity as it will be easy to come to iib supergravity
(d = 4,  = 1

2) at any step.

from the variation of the action (2.1) with respect to the metric g, we obtain1

and from that of dilaton 

(2.5)

(2.6)

0 = (cid:16)gg (cid:17) .

we assume that  depends only on one of the coordinate, say y  xd as in type iib
supergravity solution with the symmetry of iso(1, 3)  so(6) and we also assume,
as a generalization of (2.4), that g has the following form

here gij is the metric in the einstein manifold, which is deined by

rij = kgij .

(2.8)

here rij is the ricci tensor given by gij and k is a constant, especially k > 0 for
sphere and k = 0 for the at minkowski space and k < 0 for hyperboloid. such
solution generalises the previous solution of ref.[3] (where k = 0) as boundary gauge
qft lives now in four-dimensional curved spacetime. the case of k = 1 is especially
interesting as it corresponds to gauge theory in de sitter (inationary) universe.

the metric in (2.7) has the following form

gdxdx = d2 + s()

d1

xi,j=0

gijdxidxj ,

(2.23)

where s() is given by solving y in (2.22) with respect to : s() = y().

we now consider the case k < 0. first let the dilaton eld to be constant or
small. then from eq.(2.13), when y decreases from the positive innity, the function
f increases and diverges at a nite value of y : y = y0 and after that the signature
of the metric seems to change. this is not, however, real but apparent. near y = y0,
the function f (y) behaves as

where f0 is a constant. when we introduce a new coordinate u by

f (y) 

f0
y  y0

,

(2.24)

(2.25)

y  y0 = u2 ,
the metric has the following form when y  y0,
d1
xi,j=0

d+1  4f0du2 + y0

ds2

the metric in (2.26) is regular even when u  0 (y  y0) and there is no curvature
singularity. the change of coordinates in (2.25) tells that y increases again as u
increases when u > 0. then when we write the solution by the coordinate u, the
solution connects two boundaries at u =  and u = +, which would be two d-
branes. the structure of the spacetime, however, changes when the dilaton becomes
large. let us write f (y) in the following form:

f (y) =

d(d  1)
4y22h(y)

,

h(y)  1 +

c2
2yd +

kd
2y

.

(2.27)

we now investigate the condition h(y) vanishes or f (y) diverges and changes its sign.
the minimum hmin of h(y) can be found by the equation dh(y)
dy = 0, which can be
solved as follows:

(2.28)

(2.29)

(2.30)

y = y0

and we nd

hmin = 1 +

therefore h(y) does not vanish if hmin > 0, that is

we now consider the running of the gauge coupling, which is given by the dilaton
eld . from (2.14), when y is large and d > 2, we nd that the dilaton eld behaves
as

when d = 4, is proportional to an exponential of the dilaton eld . we now assume
the gauge coupling has the following form

renormalization group equations drastically. if we multiply n
the t hooft coupling gh = gn

2 . if we dene a new coordinate u by

y = u 2 ,

(2.35)

u expresses the scale on the (boundary) d dimensional space (due to holography [10]).
following the correspondence between long-distances/high-energy in the ads/cft
scheme, u can be regarded as the energy scale of the boundary eld theory. then
from (2.32), we obtain the following renormalization group equation

(2.36)

the leading behaviour is identical with the previous works [4, 6, 7, 8] but the next to
leading term contains the fractional power of (g  gs) although the square of (g  gs)
appears for k = 0 case. we should note that the qualitative behavior does not depend
on  which appears in the coupling (2.32).

hence, we found that beta-function explicitly depends on the curvature of four-
dimensional manifold. of course, curvature dependence is not yet logarithmic as
it happens with usual qfts (perturbative consideration) in curved spacetime [11].
the power-like running of gauge coupling is much stronger than in k = 0 case. note
that previous discussion of power-like running includes guts with large internal
dimensions [12]. in the case under investigation we get gauge coupling beta-function
as an expansion on fractional powers of gauge coupling.

we now consider the static potential between quark and anti-quark[5]. we

evaluate the following nambu-goto action

s =

(2.37)

(2.40)

here t is the length of the region of the denition of  . the orbit of y can be obtained

here e(l) expresses the total energy of the quark-anti-quark system. the energy
e(l) in (2.47), however, contains the divergence due to the self energies of the
innitely heavy quark and anti-quark. the sum of their self energies can be
estimated by considering the conguration x0 =  , x1 = x2 = x3 =    = xd1 = 0
and y = y() (note that x1 vanishes here) and the minimum of y is y0. using the
parametrization of (2.43) and identifying t with  (t = ), we nd the following
expression of the sum of self energies:

eself = z

note that leading and next-to-leading term does not depend on the parameter  in
(2.38). the leading behavior is consistent with the previous works but we should
note that next-to-leading term is linear in l(for k = 0 it was cubic ), which does
not depend on the dimension d. the parameters a, c 3
, d0 and d2 are all
positive, which can be easily seen from the denition of them in (2.44), (2.45) and
(2.49). on the other hand b is negative if k is positive and vice versa from (2.44)
if  > 0 as in type iib supergravity. therefore the linear potential term in (2.49)
is repulsive if k > 0 (sphere, i.e. gauge theory in de sitter universe) and attractive
if k < 0 (hyperboloid). hence, curvature is responsible now for typical connement
behaviour of non-perturbative quark-antiquark potential. the area law for wilson
factor is produced thanks to non-zero four-dimensional curvature. de sitter universe
acts against connement while hyperbolic geometry is responsible for connement
(at least within present approach).

(2.50)

y = y(x), we nd, instead of (2.40)

s =

(2.51)

we should note that k() is replaced by 1
k() compared with quark anti-quark case
(2.40), which corresponds the replacement of   . since b is proportional to

the linear potential in the next-to-leading term becomes attractive if k > 0 (de
sitter universe) and repulsive if k < 0. it is not dicult to study the curvature de-
pendence in more detail, for example, numerically for dierent choices of parameters
and regions. nevertheless, we dont do this as most qualitative features are clear.

note that t = 0,  corresponds to y = 0. therefore there is a curvature singularity
there. this tells that  expansion in string theories becomes unreliable and we need
to exclude the region t  0, . eq.(3.11) tells that the coupling becomes t-dependent,
especially in case of type iib supergravity case we nd

note that t is solved with respect to  by using (3.13). it follows from above spec-

second time( ads time). it would be interesting to understand if such a picture
may have any physical meaning.

4. axionic background with non-zero curvature and non-

constant dilaton

let us present now the generalization of above iib sg background with non-trivial
dilaton when non-constant axion is included into the action. such study for the
case of at four-dimensional space has been presented earlier in ref.[7] (for eects of
additional scalars ,see also ref.[9]).

we include the axion eld  into the action of type iib supergravity ( = 1

we work in the coordinate choice (2.7) and we assume that the d-dimensional man-
ifold is curved (2.8) and  only depends on y. then, instead of (2.9-2.11), we obtain

the obtained metric is identical to that in (2.13) where axion vanishes if we replace

 because it is hidden in this coordinate. if we choose 0 = 0, e  0. since 4e can
be regarded as the yang-mills coupling constant and   0 (y  +) corresponds
to the ultraviolet xed point from the viewpoint of ads/cft correspondence, the
theory can be regarded as asymptotically free.

we now compare the above results with those in [7] for k = 0 and d = 4. we

introduce a new coordinate r by

then the solution in [7] seems to be a special case corresponding to 0 = 0 = 0.

let us consider the potential between quark and anti-quark. as we are interesting
in the case of asymptotically free theory, we put 0 = 0 in (4.14) and d = 4. then

therefore the linear potential in the next-to-leading term becomes attractive if k < 0
and repulsive if k > 0. the result is opposite to the potential without axion in (2.49).
hence, inationary universe (k is positive) with axion predicts connement in qcd
(unlike the case of no axion).

we now investigate the supersymmetric background. for k = 0 it has been
found in ref.[7]. we look for its k-dependent generalization. since we consider the
background where the fermion elds, that is, dilatino  and gravitino  vanish, if
the variation under some of the supersymmetry transformations of these fermionic
elds vanishes the corresponding supersymmetries are preserved. the supersymme-
try transformations of these elds are given by [14]

therefore all the supersymmetries break down in general since  and  do not
vanish. in the limit of c  0, however, we nd

therefore there is a possibility that half of the supersymmetries corresponding to

 vanishes in the limit of c  0, which tells that half of the supersymmetry

on k. such solution corresponds to n = 2 super ym theory with asymptotically free
gauge coupling. (note that deformations of n = 4 super ym theory which ow to
xed points like in refs.[15, 16] may also dene running gauge coupling). in the limit
of c  0, the solution in (4.14) and (4.15) has the following form:

even in the limit, the theory becomes asymptotically free when 0 = 0 since the
coupling given by e vanishes in the ultraviolet limit corresponding to  = 0. we
should also note that the potential (0 = 0 case) between quark and anti-quark in
(4.26) is not changed in the leading and next-to-leading orders since c is not included
to the corresponding expression.

5. discussion

in summary, we found the background of iib supergravity with non-constant dilaton,
non-zero curvature of four-dimensional space-time and with (or without) non-trivial
axion. ads/cft interpretation of such solution gives the (power-like) running gauge
coupling and predicts its curvature dependence. in the presence of axion, background
may have half of supersymmetries unbroken and describe n = 2 super ym theory
with asymptotically free gauge coupling. in all cases, we calculated quark-antiquark
potential and showed that the term linear on distance l explicitly depends on the
curvature. hence, curvature of universe may predict the connement.

it would be really interesting to nd further development of such scenario so
that to present more realistic (logarithmic) behaviour for running gauge coupling.
clearly, major modications of background are necessary. note in that respect the
recent paper [17] where it was shown that ads orbifolds may describe the running
gauge coupling.

acknoweledgements. we would like to thank h.b. nielsen for discussion of two-
times cosmology. we are also indebted to a.tseytlin and a. sugamoto for discus-
sions.

appendix

in this appendix, we point out that there are many kinds of einstein manifolds which
satisfy eq.(2.8). the einstein equations are given by,

is the energy-momentum tensor of the matter elds. if we consider the

r =

g .

(5.2)

if we put  = 2k, eq.(5.2) is nothing but eq.
for the einstein manifold (2.8).
the einstein manifolds are not always homogeneous manifolds like at minkowski,
(anti-)de sitter space or nariai space but they can be some black hole solutions like
schwarzschild black hole,

for k 6= 0. in these solutions, the curvature singularity at r = 0 has a form of line
penetrating ads5 and the horizon makes a tube surrounding the singularity. this
conguration seems to express d-string whose boundary lies on the boundary of ads5
or possibly d3-brane. especially in case of kerr or kerr-(anti-)de sitter solution,
the object corresponding to the singularity has an angular momentum.

we should note that the dilaton depends on the geometry of the boundary man-
ifold only through k as in (2.14). therefore the behavior of the running coupling
or renormalization group equation is irrelevant with the existence of the black hole
singularity.
