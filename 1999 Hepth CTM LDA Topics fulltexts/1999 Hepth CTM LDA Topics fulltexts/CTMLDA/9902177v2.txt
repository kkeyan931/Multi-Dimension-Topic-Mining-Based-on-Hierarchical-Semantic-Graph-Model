abstract

by making use of the abelian projection method, a dual version of the su(2)-gluodynamics
with manifest monopole-like excitations, arising from the integration over singular gauge transfor-
mations, is formulated in the continuum limit. the resulting eective theory emerges due to the
summation over the grand canonical ensemble of these excitations in the dilute gas approximation.
as a result, the dual abelian gauge boson acquires a nonvanishing (magnetic) mass due to the
debye screening eects in such a gas. the obtained theory is then used for the construction of the
corresponding eective potential of monopole loop currents and the string representation. finally,
by virtue of this representation, conning properties of the su(2)-gluodynamics are emphasized.

1 introduction

nowadays, it is commonly argued that the method of abelian projection [1] is one of the most
challengable approaches to solve the problem of connement in qcd within the dynamical scheme
of a dual superconductor [2] (for a recent review see e.g. [3]). in particular, a detailed perturbative
analysis of the su(2)-qcd within the dual approach has been performed [4, 5], and the asymptotic
freedom of the resulting eective abelian theory has been proved. as far as the property of
connement in the abelian-projected su(n)-qcd is concerned, it has been argued in refs. [5, 6]
that it occurs owing to the condensation of cooper pairs of magnetic monopoles, described by the
magnetic higgs eld. spontaneous breaking of the resulting u(1) symmetries then leads to the
generation of the mass terms of the dual gauge elds. this makes the eective abelian-projected
su(n) gauge theory, obtained in this way, quite similar to the (london limit of the) dual abelian
higgs type model with the [u(1)]n1 gauge invariance. in the latter model, connement can be
analytically studied by casting the corresponding partition function into the form of an integral
over the world-sheets of the closed abrikosov-nielsen-olesen strings [7] by making use of the so-
called path-integral duality transformation. this transformation elaborated on for the abelian
higgs model in refs. [8, 9] has been employed for a derivation of the string representations for the
partition functions and eld strength correlators in abelian-projected su(2)- and su(3)-qcd in
refs. [10] and [11], respectively 1. after that, performing the derivative expansion [13] of the so-
obtained string eective action, one gets as the rst two terms of this expansion the usual nambu-
goto term and the so-called rigidity term [14], whose coupling constants ensure connement (in
the sense of the wilsons area law [15]) and stability of the abrikosov-nielsen-olesen strings.

the aim of the present paper is to derive an eective low-energy dual theory of abelian-
projected su(2)-gluodynamics in the continuum limit by summing over the grand canonical en-
semble of monopole loop currents, which emerge during the abelian projection. moreover, in
this way we shall not make the standard assumption on the formation and subsequent conden-
sation of cooper pairs of magnetic monopoles, but shall rather treat the ensemble of monopole
loop currents in the dilute gas approximation. next, in order to achieve our main goal, which
is a manifestation of connement in the su(2)-gluodynamics, we nd it necessary to derive a
string representation of the obtained theory. the latter one is implied as a certain mechanism
realizing the independence of the wilson loop describing a test particle, electrically charged w.r.t.
the maximal abelian u(1) subgroup of the original su(2) group, of the shape of some surface
bounded by the contour of this wilson loop. the construction of such a mechanism, which will be
performed below, is based on the summation over branches of the multivalued eective potential
of monopole loop currents, which emerges in the representation of the obtained dual model in
terms of an integral over these currents. note that such an approach is the 4d generalization of
the corresponding 3d one, investigated in ref. [16]. in that paper, it has been demonstrated that
this approach parallels the one proposed in ref. [17] for the construction of a string representation
of 3d compact qed (see also ref. [18] for the 4d generalizations). notice also that within our
approach, the dual gauge eld acquires a mass dynamically, i.e. by virtue of the debye screening
in the gas of monopole loop currents. the appearance of this mass then leads to a nonvanishing
string tension and thus connement of an electrically charged test particle. such a mechanism
of the mass generation conceptually diers from the one of refs. [5, 19], which employed among
others the cumulant expansion theorem in the bilocal approximation [20]. as a by-product of the

present work, we propose a method of a derivation of the eective dual theory, describing a 4d
dilute gas of monopole loop currents, which does not exploit the corresponding lattice partition
function, as it has been done in ref. [18].

the organization of the paper is as follows. in the next section, we shall revisit a derivation of
the eective dual theory, corresponding to the abelian-projected su(2)-gluodynamics. after that,
we shall perform the path-integral summation over the grand canonical ensemble of uctuating
random monopole loop currents, which emerge during the abelian projection, in the dilute gas
approximation and arrive at a certain eective eld theory describing this ensemble. in section
3, this theory will be used for the calculation of the potential of monopole loop currents and
the derivation of the corresponding string representation. finally, the latter one will yield us
connement of an electrically charged test particle in the sense of the wilsons area law. the
resume of the work and concluding remarks are presented in summary and discussions.

2 eective dual theory of the abelian-projected su (2)-

gluodynamics

in the present section, we shall derive an eective dual model corresponding to the abelian-
projected su(2)-gluodynamics. the starting points of this derivation will somewhat parallel that
of refs. [4, 5, 6]. the action under study reads 2

as it has been demonstrated in refs. [4, 5], all the terms on the r.h.s. of eq. (3) depending
on the o-diagonal gluons aa

constant and yield asymptotic freedom. namely, the running coupling constant coincides with
that of the original gluodynamics and reads g()2 = g(0)2 + b0
with
c2(g) standing for the casimir operator of the adjoint representation of the group g = su(2)
under consideration, i.e. c2(g) = 2. since in what follows our aim will be the investigation of the
conning (i.e. infrared) properties of the abelian-projected su(2)-gluodynamics (rather than the
problems of its renormalization, related to the region of asymptotic freedom), we shall disregard
the aa
-dependent terms (this approximation is usually referred to as the abelian dominance
hypothesis [24].). within this approximation, the resulting eective action takes the form

the monopole current is dened via the modied bianchi identities as follows

with f = 1

as a u(1) gauge theory with monopole loop currents. our aim then will be to investigate conning
properties of such a theory by a derivation of its string representation. to this end, let us rst

cast the partition function under study, z = r dfda exp (se. [a,f]), to the dual form 5.

this can be done by making use of the rst-order formalism, i.e.
 in
eq. (4) by introducing an integration over an auxiliary antisymmetric tensor eld b as follows

integration over the a-eld leads to the constraint (cid:16)b  if(cid:17) = 0, whose resolution yields

it is worth noting that due to the conservation of the monopole current jm

standing in the exponent on the r.h.s. of eq. (7) is invariant under the magnetic gauge transfor-
mations b  b +. again, we shall imply that the gauge xing term for the b-eld is included
into the integration measure db. moreover, we shall specify the gauge to be the fock-schwinger
one, i.e. xb(x) = 0.
our next aim is to sum up over the ensemble of monopole loop currents in the dual theory (7).
to this end, we shall treat this ensemble as the grand canonical one and make an assumption that
monopole loop currents form a dilute gas. then, since the energy of a single monopole is known
to be a quadratic function of its ux, it is more energetically favorable for the vacuum to support
a conguration of two monopoles of a unit magnetic charge than one monopole of the double
charge. therefore, only the monopoles with the minimal charges qagm with qa = 1 are essential,
whereas the ones with |qa| > 1 tend to dissociate into those with |qa| = 1. here, the magnetic
coupling constant gm is related to the qcd coupling g via the topological quantization condition
ggm = 4n.
in what follows, we shall set in this condition n = 1, which parallels the above
restriction to the monopoles possessing the minimal charge only. obviously, the same restriction
then holds for the dirac strings ending up at monopole-antimonopole pairs, as well. the collective
current of n monopoles takes the form

owing to this result, the partition function of the grand canonical ensemble of monopole loop

the (magnetic) debye mass of the b-eld, which it acquires due to the screening by magnetic
loop currents, can now be immediately read o from the expansion of the cosine and has the

form m =

a continuum version of the corresponding lattice expression) has been used in ref. [18] as a
starting point for the construction of the string representation of the 4d compact qed. our
construction of an analogous representation for the model (14) will be performed in a more simple
way. namely, we shall construct such a string representation by virtue of the representation of
the model under study in terms of the monopole loop currents, which is a 4d generalization of
the corresponding expression for the 3d partition function in terms of the monopole densities,
investigated in ref. [16].

3 string representation and connement

in the present section, we shall construct the string representation for the wilson loop of an
electrically charged (w.r.t. the maximal abelian u(1) subgroup of the original su(2) group) test
particle in the eective abelian-projected theory (14). such a representation will enable us to
manifest connement in this theory. to get the desired string representation, we shall rst derive
the representation of the corresponding partition function in terms of the integral over monopole
loop currents. to this end, notice that integrating over the eld b in eq. (7) one gets for the

where the term xing the fock-schwinger gauge for the lagrange multiplier  is again assumed
to be included into the integration measure. notice that dj here is the standard integration
measure over the vector eld, which is of the same form as d.
clearly, due to the -function standing on the r.h.s. of the rst equality in eq. (15), if we
integrate the lagrange multiplier  out of this equation, the resulting expression will be just the
desired representation of the partition function in terms of the monopole loop currents. in order

let us now proceed with the string representation of the wilson loop in the eective theory (14).
assuming for a while that the monopole loop currents are absent, one has for this object the
following expression

9 in the thermodynamic limit, where the number of monopole loop currents n and the four-volume of observation
v innitely increase with the density of the loop currents  = n/v being kept xed, the collective current (8) can
be treated as a continuous function of disorder type. in what follows, we assume that the free path length l of
monopole loop currents is much smaller than the characteristic size of the wilson loop of an external electrically
charged test particle.

which is the standard perimeter (gaussian) contribution to the wilson loop.

however in the presence of monopole loop currents, one should properly extend the eld
strength tensor f in analogue to eqs. (4) and (5) in order to satisfy bianchi identities modied
by the current j. this can be done by using the complete eld strength tensor f + h, where
the uctuating antisymmetric tensor-disorder eld h (the so-called kalb-ramond eld [25]) just
obeys these modied identities, i.e. 

h = j.

by virtue of the stokes theorem, we then obtain for the full wilson loop the following expression

here, the average over currents is dened by the partition function (17), and  is an arbitrary

x than by virtue of the gauss law, d  ds  ds, one can check that for the conserved
current j, r d4xj = r dsj, as it should be. here, ds stands for the oriented element of the
hypersurface bounded by .). an apparent -dependence of eq. (20) actually drops out due to
the summation over branches of the multivalued potential (18). this is the essence of the string
representation of the wilson loop in the eective dual theory (14).

let us now consider the weak-eld limit, i.e. the limit |j|  , and investigate the (stable)
minimum of the real branch of the potential of monopole loop currents. this corresponds to

9

extracting the term with n = 0 from the whole sum in eq. (18). then, since we have restricted
ourselves to the only one branch of the potential, the -independence of the wilson loop is spoiled.
in order to restore it, let us choose  to be the surface of the minimal area for a given contour
c, unambiguously dened by this contour (see discussion in ref. [16]),  = min. [c]. then the

where h = h + h + h is the eld strength tensor of the kalb-ramond eld h. it
is worth noting, that the mass of the kalb-ramond eld following from the quadratic part of the
action standing in the exponent on the r.h.s. of eq. (23) is equal to the debye mass m of the
eld b following from eq. (14). integration over the kalb-ramond eld is now straightforward
and can be performed along the lines of ref. [10]. obviously, after such an integration, one gets
the string eective action sstr. =  lnhw (c)iweakeld in the form of an interaction between two
world-sheet elements mediated by the propagator of this eld. a certain part of this interaction
can be rewritten by the stokes theorem as the perimeter yukawa type interaction (see ref. [10]
for details). the remaining part, once being expanded in powers of the derivatives w.r.t. as
(which is equivalent to the 1/m-expansion) by virtue of the results of ref. [13], yields as the rst
two terms of this expansion the standard nambu-goto one and the so-called rigidity term [14],

with gab = (ax())(bx()) being the induced metric tensor

here, a = /a, g = det(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
of the world-sheet, and t = abg
tensor. the string tension  of the nambu-goto term (i.e. the coecient in the wilsons area
law) and the inverse coupling constant of the rigidity term, 1/0, are completely determined via
the parameters of the model (14) and read   g2
128 . here, c stands for a
characteristic small dimensionless parameter, which in the model under study is reasonable to be
set c  g 1/4/. notice that the string tension is obviously proportional to the square of the debye
mass m of the dual gauge eld b and consequently nonanalytic in the qcd coupling constant g.
this result reects the nonperturbative nature of connement in the eective abelian-projected
theory (14) similar to that in the original non-abelian su(2)-gluodynamics.

in conclusion of this section, note that the signs of the string tension and coupling constant of
the rigidity term support the stability of strings described by the eective action se.. while the
requirement of positiveness of the string tension is obvious already for the very existence of strings,
it is worth briey discussing the requirement of the negativeness of the coupling constant of the
rigidity term. a simple argument in favour of this observation can be obtained by considering the
propagator corresponding to the string eective action (24) in the so-called conformal gauge for
the induced metric, gab = abg

. for a certain lorentz index  it reads

hx()x(0)i = 

where  denotes the ir momentum cuto, and k0 is the modied bessel function. contrary to
that, for positive 0 an unphysical pole in the propagator occurs, which conrms our statement.
thus we conclude that the obtained string characteristica manifest connement and provide us
with the necessary condition for the stability of strings in the obtained eective abelian-projected
theory (14).

4 summary and discussions

in the present paper, by considering a grand canonical ensemble of uctuating monopole-like
excitations emerging in the abelian-projected su(2)-gluodynamics, we have derived an eective
disorder eld theory describing this ensemble in the continuum limit. contrary to the previous
approaches, this has been done without an assumption on the formation and condensation of
cooper pairs of monopoles, i.e. without introducing the corresponding magnetic higgs eld.
instead of that, we have dealt directly with the dilute coulomb gas of monopole loop currents
(describing the creation and annihilation of the monopole-antimonopole pairs). the proposed
approach provided us with a natural dynamical mechanism of generation of a mass of the dual
gauge eld, which is due to the debye screening in the gas of monopole loop currents.

next, within the obtained theory we have investigated the string representation of the wilson
loop, which describes an external particle electrically charged w.r.t. the maximal abelian u(1)-
subgroup of the original su(2)-group. the essence of this representation is a certain mechanism
realizing the independence of the wilson loop of some surface, bounded by its contour. as it
has been illustrated, this mechanism is based on the summation over branches of the multivalued
eective potential of monopole loop currents. finally, in the weak-eld limit of the obtained
eective abelian-projected theory, we have derived the string tension of the nambu-goto term
and the inverse coupling constant of the rigidity term, which in a manifest way express connement
in the sense of the wilsons area law and signal the stability of strings. in particular, the string
tension turned out to be nonanalytic in the qcd coupling constant analogously to what happens
in the original gluodynamics.

in conclusion, it is worth mentioning that the approach to the problem of connement, inves-
tigated in the present work, essentially employed the disorder (stochastic) nature of uctuations

11

of monopole loop currents and related dirac strings. in particular, the resulting stochastic corre-
lations of topological monopole-like excitations are an important dynamical ingredient for getting
the wilsons area law. note that this dynamical mechanism connes (chromo)electric charges of
both test quarks and gluons. in this sense, the above disorder (stochastic) approach diers from
the standard one, where the area law follows from the nontrivial linking of some topological objects
(like zn -vortices [26]) with the contour of the wilson loop. notice that if one had xed the gauge
further, leaving, for example, the zn center symmetry, the gluons would have been uncharged, and
the physics of their connement would be left obscure [27]. note also that, contrary to the most
well known monopoles, abelian-projected monopoles are described by stochastic loop currents.
owing to that, associated stochastically distributed abrikosov-nielsen-olesen type strings neither
do not need to be a solution of the usual classical eld equations of motion nor to be described
by a vacuum expectation value of some eld.

clearly, it is now a challenge to apply the present approach to the more realistic case of

su(3)-gluodynamics. work in this direction is now in progress [28].
