abstract

majumder and sen have given an explicit construction of a rst order phase
transition in a nonsupersymmetric system of dbranes that occurs when the
b eld is varied. we show that the description of this transition in terms of
k-theory involves a bundle of k groups of noncommutative algebras over
the kahler cone with nontrivial monodromy. thus the study of monodromy
in k groups associated with quantized algebras can be used to predict the
phase structure of systems of (nonsupersymmetric) dbranes.

a major development in string theory over the past couple of years has been an increasing
understanding of nonsupersymmetric dbranes and their dynamics, initiated largely by sen
[1]. the relevance of k-theory for the classication of dbrane charges was pointed out by
witten [2] following earlier work of minasian and moore [3]. reviews of these developments
are [46].

the motivation for the present work was an intriguing observation made by majumder
and sen [7]. using an exact conformal eld theory description [8] of non-supersymmetric
dbranes on a k3 surface, they found three dierent phases in the region on the moduli space
where the surface looks like an orbifold x = t 4/zz2. the phase diagram in fig. 1 represents
dierent states (labeled as i, ii and iii) of two d-branes 1 wrapped over exceptional 2-
cycles s1 and s2 in x, which correspond to xed points in the orbifold limit. in phase i the
two dbranes recombine into a single dbrane wrapped over a nonsupersymmetric cycle with
the homology class [s] = [s1] + [s2]. this happens when the minimal radius of t 4 becomes
less than the dierence of the b-eld uxes through s1 and s2,  < r with the appropriate
normalization. from the analysis of the tachyon potential [7]

of p will not be important in our discussion, as long as p  2. in k-theory this periodicity is just
bott periodicity.

( is the parameter labelling the marginal deformation, normalized so that  = 0 mod 2
represents the pair of dbranes and  = 1 mod 2 represents the nonbps brane) one can see
that transitions between regions i and ii and between regions i and iii are second order.
there is no discontinuous jump in the location of the minimum of the tachyon potential
in these transitions. on the other hand, as we pass through the phase boundary between
regions ii and iii the dbranes ip their orientation via a rst order phase transition. the
three phases coexist at the critical radius rc ( = 0) where the antiperiodic tachyonic mode
becomes exactly marginal.

we want to understand this phase diagram from the point of view of k-theory and see if
such transitions are possible at all. k groups classify dbrane charges [3,2]. therefore, this
phase diagram indicates that a certain element of a k group is mapped to an appropriate
inverse as one crosses the transition line between phases ii and iii.
in other words, it
means that a k-group element undergoes a monodromy as one goes around the point rc in
the r   plane. indeed, because there is no discontinuity along the lines of the second order
phase transitions between phases ii and i, and between phases i and iii, we do not expect
to see these lines in the deformation of the k groups. what this means precisely, and what
can be predicted from this point of view, constitute the topics of the present paper.

as we explain below, the observation of majumder and sen is a rather general phe-
nomenon in k-theory, and we will formulate the explicit condition when it takes place for
a general space x. it will turn out that the appropriate setting for the analysis is algebraic
k-theory (for introductory treatments see [9,10]), i.e. instead of a space x we consider the
ring (algebra) a of continuous functions on x. although the algebraic k-theory of a is
isomorphic to topological k-theory of x for smooth x, the former has two major benets:

 even if the geometry of x is singular, a may remain a well-dened algebra. for
example, if x is a quotient space with possible xed point singularities, a is a crossed
product algebra [12].

 majumder and sen consider a blow-up of x corresponding to a b-eld ux through
2-cycles in x. such non-geometric defomations of x have a natural interpretation in
terms of non-commutative deformations of a [1113].

an attempt to formulate string theory in algebraic terms can be found in [14].

we briey recall the denition of k-groups that measure dbrane charges. in topological
k-theory k 0(x) is dened as the group of pairs (e, f ) of vector bundles modulo the
equivalence relation (e, f )  (e  h, f  h ) which allows creation and annihilation of
braneanti-brane pairs with isomorphic gauge bundles h and h . in algebraic k-theory
the grothendieck group k0(a) is dened in a similar way with bundles over x replaced
by projective modules over a.
it is convenient to use another
(equivalent) denition of k0(a) via idempotents in mn(a), the set of n  n matrices, with
coecients in a. to allow direct sum and tensor product of idempotents, one actually has
to consider the direct limit m(a) = lim mn(a) with the inductive limit topology. then
unitary equivalence classes of projection operators :

in practice, however,

   = 

(2)

in m(a) form a semigroup s  s(a) under addition. the grothendieck group associated
with this semigroup is constructed as follows. on ss dene an equivalence relation (a, b) 

2

(a, b) if a + b = a + b. then k0(a) = s  s/. by denition k0 is a covariant functor,
i.e. any homomorphism  : a  b of c -algebras a and b induces a homomorphism
 : k0(a)  k0(b).
if we dene a suspension as the set of continuous functions from
the real line to a, a  c(ir  a) = a  c(ir), we may introduce the higher k-group
k1(a) = k0(a). equivalently, one can dene k1(a) as the abelian group of equivalence
classes of invertible elements in m(a), with equivalence dened by right translation by
elements of the group that are in the identity component. complex bott periodicity is the
statement that k0(2a) = k0(a).

according to connes, douglas and schwarz [11], the presence of a uniform b-eld can be
interpreted in terms of a quantization of the function algebra of the manifold, `a la fedosov
[15]. their deep insight has led to numerous developments [12,13] on this theme. we are
interested in a b-eld which is not uniform [7]. since no precise relation to deformation
quantization has been established for this case, we assume that a general b-eld leads to the
deformed algebra a with the  product dened by kontsevich [16]. in fact, as it will become
clear in a moment, the results of this paper do not depend on this assumption; one just has
to know that turning on a b-eld leads to some associative deformation of a product on a :

f  g = f g +  f 1 g + . . .

(3)

where  is the deformation parameter.
in the following we will only make the  symbol
explicit when we need to emphasize the deformed product. the  product depends not just
on b but also on the kahler form j. however, this dependence is such that when b = 0
the algebra is not expected to undergo any deformation [11,13]. this is perhaps surprising
at rst sight since the natural variable in string theory is b + ij, but it follows from the
modularlike invariance of the  product under t duality.

thus, over each point in the (r, ) plane we have an algebra in which the product
depends on the value of z  (r, ). we shall take the undeformed algebra in our model
to be the algebra at z = rc. therefore we dene the deformation parameter   z  rc.
computing the k groups of these algebras at each point in the z-plane, we obtain a bundle
of k groups. these k groups at dierent points on the (r, ) plane a priori have little to
do with each other.

however, the important point is that k groups are, generally speaking, rigid under
deformation quantization [17]. this fact is the conceptual reason why bps states survive
turning on a b-eld and why bps conditions in the presence of a b-eld are very simple
to state in terms of the  product [13]. now it is easy to see the deformation of (2) under
quantization. given a projection p in a0, where a0 is the algebra before quantization, we
need to nd a projection p in a such that p  p = p and lim 0 p = p. this can be
solved recursively as a power series, or by using the dierential equation

p
  p + p  p

 + p   p = p
 ,

(4)

where  denotes the derivative of the  dependence in the  product, with the obvious
boundary condition at  = 0. thus there is a natural manner in which the bres of the
k-group bundle are all isomorphic, so it actually is a bre bundle. given this isomorphism,
we can meaningfully consider the monodromy of sections of this bre bundle as we move
around  = 0.

3

in supersymmetric cases such monodromies are very well understood from the relation

between the mukai vector [11]:

~q = ch(e)e [b]

2i  h even(x, zz)

(5)

and the chern character of a projective module e. in physics this expression appears in
the chern-simons coupling of ramond-ramond elds. let us explain the origin of the
monodromy in algebraic k-theory by a simple example of type iib compactication on
a non-commutative torus. an ordinary torus t 2 can be represented as a quotient space
x = s1  ir/zz. the corresponding crossed product algebra a0 = c(s1)  zz is generated
by two unitary operators that commute with each other. its non-commutative deformation
a = c(s1) zz is dened by twisting the multiplication by a   aut(c(s1)): ag = g (a)
for all a  c(s1) and g  zz. the deformed algebra a is morita equivalent to a non-
commutative torus which is believed to describe a compactication on a torus with a b-eld
ux [11]. because a is still a crossed product algebra, we can use the pimsnervoiculescu
exact sequence [18] to compute its k groups:

. . .  k0(c(s1)) id

 k0(c(s1))  k0(c(s1)  zz)  k1(c(s1))  . . .

(6)

first of all, from this sequence we see the result, alluded to above, that k-theory is rigid
under deformation quantization. this follows from the fact that the map id is homotopic
to zero, so that the pimsnervoiculescu exact sequence reduces to a short exact sequence
and splits. the same statement is also true in real k-theory [19]. furthermore, from (6) we
nd k0(a ) = zz +  zz, so that charges of odd-dimensional dbranes undergo a monodromy:

~q  (cid:18) 1 1

0 1(cid:19) ~q

as the b-eld changes by a period.

in the non-supersymmetric situation considered by majumder and sen [7], we expect
monodromy in going around the point rc in the z plane. we wish to stress here that
in the moduli space of k3 with a b-eld this monodromy does not correspond to any
non-trivial element of the rst fundamental group. we do not have a suciently detailed
understanding of the k group bundle in the majumder-sen case to compute this monodromy
exactly. however, we shall now explicitly construct a simple local model showing how such
monodromy arises.

if  is the projection corresponding to phase ii, in going around a small loop centered
at rc we expect to nd a projection associated with the nonbps dbrane with the opposite
charge. what is the projection associated with such an oppositely charged dbrane? the
sum of a charge and the opposite charge should be equivalent to a trivial bundle, but  is
not a projection so we have to work a little harder to nd an inverse. given a projection ,
and a projection n such that n > , we note that

(n  )2 = n  n  n +  = n  

(7)

so n   is also a projection. for an appropriate choice of n this is a natural candidate for
the projection associated with the oppositely charged dbrane. the physical motivation for

4

this answer is based on the description of dbranes as topological defects in a gauge bundle
of higher dimensional branes [2]. we say that two dbranes carry opposite charges if they are
represented by the gauge bundles e and f , such that the total bundle e  f is isomorphic
to a trivial bundle. it is easy to see that  and n  satisfy the expected property provided
that n > .

now the condition for monodromy around rc is

( e2i) = u(n  ( ))u 

(8)

where | | is the radius of a small circle around rc in the z plane, see fig. 1. evaluating at
 = 0 we nd a condition in the undeformed k0(a0) group:

0 = u(n  0)u  .

(9)

as a simple example, the reader may nd it helpful to keep in mind the following two-

dimensional model:

0 = (cid:18) 1 0

0 0(cid:19) ,

2 = (cid:18) 1 0

0 1(cid:19) , u = (cid:18) 0

1

1

0(cid:19) .

(10)

where we assume that u does not depend on z. this may be too strong an assumption in
the general case, but suces for the local model we construct.

it is clear that order by order one can reconstruct the solution to (2) and (8) as a power

series in  :

(z) = 0 +  1 +  22 + . . .

.

(11)

the exact form of the solution will depend on the details of the  product. to see this, we
write down the rst order equations that follow from (2) and (8):

{1, u} = 0,

1  {1, 0} = 0 1 0.

(12)

proceeding in the same fashion, we expect to nd solutions to (8) only at specic points on
the moduli space (in our case, on the z plane). these points represent the endpoints of the
phase boundaries where some tachyonic modes become massless [7].

to summarize, in our local model, we have shown that when the equation (8) has a solu-
tion, there is a section of the k group bundle with monodromy appropriate for describing the
physics of a rst order phase transition between dierent stable congurations of dbranes.
thus k-theory combined with a knowledge of the deformation of the algebra product as a
function of moduli (in this case the dierence in the b eld ux through the 2cycles) can
be used to predict the phase structure of systems of (nonsupersymmetric) dbranes.

in conclusion we mention that there are other kinds of phase transitions when a sheaf e
associated with a dbrane becomes unstable or split. the equation of the phase boundary
follows from the bogomolov condition:

zx (cid:16)2rc2  (r  1)c2

1(cid:17)  j (n2) = 0

(13)

for a sheaf e of rank r over an n-dimensional space x to be strictly stable with respect to
a kahler form j.
