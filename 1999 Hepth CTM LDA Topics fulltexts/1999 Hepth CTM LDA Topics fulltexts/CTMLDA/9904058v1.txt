abstract

in this letter, we show how one can solve easily the potts-3 + branching inter-
actions and potts- matrix models, by the means of the equations of motion (loop
equations). we give an algebraic equation for the resolvents of theses models, and
their scaling behaviour. this shows that the equations of motion can be a useful tool
for solving such models.

1 introduction :

random matrices are useful for a wide range of physical problems. in particular, by the
means of feynman rules, random matrices can be interpreted in term of two-dimensional
surfaces, which themselves are related to two-dimensional quantum gravity [1]. 2d quan-
tum gravity models can be coupled to matter elds, with a non-zero central charge c.
in term of matrices, this leads to consider multi-matrix models, which, studied near their
critical points, in the scaling limit, allow to recover a continuous theory.

among the random matrix models, the q-states potts matrices models are dicult to
compute by usual methods when q  3 since the relative angles between the matrices are
no longer independent.
indeed, these angles then cannot easily be integrated out, and
thus, it is not possible to work in a simple manner on the eigenvalues of these matrices.

as for the method of the equations of motion (also called loop equations), it is a well-
known useful tool for solving one-matrix models (or even chains of matrices [2, 3]), but
general multi-matrices models often do not lead to closed sets of equations. in particular,
the potts-3 and potts- models were not known to be solvable through this method.
in the rst part, we shall show how simple ideas can enable us to solve the potts-3
matrix model (even with a branching interactions term) through the equations of motion
method. in particular, we obtain an algebraic equation for the resolvent, which was not
obtained through the j.m. daul [4] 1995 method. however, algebraic equations have just
been obtained for similar models in recent developpments of this method [5]. we derive
the bicritical line and critical behaviour of the potts-3 plus branched polymers model.

in the second part, we briey summarize the equations of motion point of view in
another potts model : the potts- model, which solution is already well-known from
wexlers work [6], but which appeared to us as a good example of the use of the equations
of motion in potts models.

let us dene :

all these matrices are (3n)  (3n) matrices as 1, 2, 3 are n  n hermitean matrices.
the partial derivatives of  with respect to tr2
are u and c respectively. if
these are constants, then we recover the usual potts-3 model. here we take u = 1 + htr2
6n ,
where h is the branched polymers coupling constant. the addition of branched polymers,
and the study of the critical lines (and, if possible, renormalization group ows) of such a
model may be a useful tool to understand the c = 1 transition [8, 10, 9].
let us note, for convenience :

2n and tr

2n

ti1i2 ink =

1
3n htri1i2 . . . inki

where i1, . . ., in can be +1, 1 or 0, and h. . .i is the expectation value of (. . .) :

h. . .i =

1

z z d (. . .) en 2v ()

(4)

(5)

a trace will be said to be of order m if there are m matrices  in it. for example, the
above trace is of order k + n  1.

let us now use the method of the equations of motion. if we make the innitesimal

change in variables

with

   +  i1 i2 . . . in

(6)

then we obtain the expression of the general equations of motion :

i1 + i2 + . . . + in  0

(mod 3)

g ti1...in2 + u ti1...in + c (t(i1+1)i2...(in1) + t(i11)i2...(in+1)) 

n1

xj=1

ti1...ij tij+1...in = 0

(7)

these equations relate any expectation value of trace containing 2 to expectation values
of traces of lower orders. a trace which does not contain two identical matrices side by
side, however, cannot be obtained that way. moreover, beginning with tn, one obtains, [ n
2 ]
steps later, a n [ n
2 ] order trace which does not contain 2 any more. thus, the recurrence
stops there. the idea to overcome this problem is in fact very simple :
it is to use the
invariance of traces by circular permutations to get rid of the n + 1 order term in the above
equation. then, one obtains relations between traces without 2.

this idea applies to the computation of the resolvent as follows. let us rst note

0 =  is the usual resolvent. using the change in variables :

i1...in =

1
3n htri1 . . . in

1

z  i

   + 

1

z  

2

(8)

(9)

we obtain the equation :

z (u + gz)   u  gz  g t  2 + 2 c + = 0

   + +

1

z  

(10)

(11)

similarly,

yields :

z (u + gz) +  (u + gz) t  g t+   + + c +0 + c  = 0

(12)

and, by the means of similar changes in variables, we have the equations :

z (u + gz)   (u + gz) t+  g t + c 0 + c ++    = 0

(13)

these equations alone are not sucient to compute (z).

z (u + gz) ++ (u + gz) t g t++ + c +0+ + c +  ++ = 0 (14)
indeed, if we intend to
calculate (z), we start from trn terms, and generate t+n terms, i.e. +(z). these,
in turn, generate the function (z) and so on.

indeed,+0 and similar functions are easy to deal with as we know how to compute

traces containing 2. the change in variables :

   + 

1

z  

+

yields (+ = + for symmetry reasons)

and similar changes in variables lead to the equations :

g +0 + (u + c) + + c z   c = 0

g 0 + u  + c +0 + c z +  c t = 0

g +0+ + u ++ + c z   c t+ + c 0  t  = 0

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

but, to compute +, as mentionned previously, we have to substract two dierent

changes in variables and use cyclicity of traces :

   + [(z  )1  (z  )12]

yields

c (+ + +  0  0++)   + t + = 0

(19)

(20)

this equation, as we know how to compute +, , 0 and 0++, relates +
to +.

   + ((z  )1  (z  )12)

3

allows us to relate similarly + to +. then

   + ((z  )1++  (z  )1++)

(21)

allows us to relate + to ++++, and we have ++++ = + as the roles of +
and  are completely symmetric.
finally, as a result of these operations, we have :

+ + + = k(z)

(22)

where k(z) only contains easy to compute  functions. we can then write an equation for
+ and thus for + which only involves  functions that we either already know
or are able to compute similarly as was done during the two rst steps of the procedure.
that way, our set of equations is closed, and we obtain an order ve algebraic equation
for (z). for the exact expression of this equation see appendix a. the equation only
contains four unknown parameters :

t =

1
n htr1i, t+ =

1
n htr12i, t+++ =

1
n htr123i, t++ =

1
n htr1213i
(23)
these parameters are also the ones that would be involved if we used the renormalisa-
tion group method [7, 10, 9] to compute the potts-3 model. the ordinary potts-3 model
would then be related to the potts-3 + branched polymers model, with arbitrary functions
u and c; but the presence of t+++ shows us it would also be related to the dilute potts-3
model, where one has a 1
n tr(1 + 2 + 3)3 term. finally, the t++ term shows us it
may also be related to more complicated quartic models.

we are now going to derive the critical behaviour and critical line of the model from our
equation. the values of the unknown parameters are xed by the physical constraint that
the resolvent has only one physical cut which corresponds to the support of the eigenvalues
of . then, one can study the critical behaviour of the model.

it is easy to search for the potts bicritical line. indeed, the bicritical scaling behaviour

of the resolvent is then, if we denote the physical cut of  as [a, b] :

(z)  (z  a)

1

2 when z  a and (z)  (z  b)

6

5 when z  b

(24)

the corresponding exponent s is  1
the model.

5 , which corresponds to the c = 4

5 central charge of

better than searching for the resolvent for any values of the coupling constants, it is
easier to search for the resolvent only on this bicritical line where the presence of the 6
5
exponent leads to simple conditions on the derivatives of the algebraic equation.

we obtain (recall that : u = 1 + htr2

6n , where h is the branched polymers coupling

constant) :

105 c3 + 4 g2 = 0
2480625 c2 (1  4c + 43c2) + 296100 c (15 + 113c) h  692968 h2 = 0

(25)

let us note here that, when h = 0 (no branched polymers) we recover the potts-3

bicritical point :

2  47

c =

105
2  3 + 47
41 + 47!

this point was already found in [4] by j.m. daul, but he did not have the algebraic equation
for the resolvent. in a recent paper [5], p. zinn-justin also obtains algebraic equations for
similar problems. his method, though, does not involve loop equations, and is rather in
the j.m. daul spirit.

3 the potts- model :
we are now going to briey derive the solution for the potts- model, from the equations
of motion point of view.
let us denote  =

) d(x, y) + g  gy b(y)  c a(x)  b(y) (gx + u) = 0 (30)

we can get rid of d(x, y) since, when x (gx + u) + c y  a(x)  b(y)
q = 0, d(x, y) remains
nite, thus g  gy b(y) c a(x) b(y) (gx + u) = 0. this is sucient to relate a(x) to b(y).

5

moreover, the value of b(y) is easy to compute when q = .

let us briey summarize this computation : we calculate the value of htrx ni in the
first :

q   limit.

)

(31)

htrx ni = htr1 . . . ni + o(

1
q

(recall that all the i play the same role).

if we now separate the rst n matrices from the remaining q  n (with q  n), and
suppose there is a saddle point for the eigenvalues of n+1+...+q
, then this saddle point is
(in the q   limit) independent from the matrices 1 , . . . , n. then, in this limit, up
to a change in variables : k = uku 1, we have n independent matrice 1 . . . n. each
of them has the partition function

q

zc = z d k en ( g

3 tr 3

k+ u

2 tr 2

k+ctr kc )

(32)

as tr1 . . . n = tr 1 . . . n, we have htrx ni = trh 1ic . . .h nic where h. . .ic is the
expectation value obtained with the partition function zc (cf eq. (32) ).
the matrices k , k = 1, . . . n all play the same part, and htrx ni = trn

c, thus

(33)
this must give us c, provided we calculate h 1ic in function of c. this is a solvable

c = trh 1in

trn

problem, but it is much faster to note that

c = t 1qn qn

(34)

is solution. thus,

1

qnhtrx ni = (t)n, and b(y) is simply (y  t)1.

this gives us immediately the solution for a(x) : it obeys a second order equation and

reads :

a(x) =

1
2

(x(u + gx) + c t q(x(u + gx) + ct)2  4(u + gx + gt))

(35)

the potts- plus branched polymers model is thus very similar to an ordinary pure
gravity model. as previously, we compute the parameter t by imposing that the resolvent
a(x) has only one physical cut. the model is critical when a(x) behaves as (x cste)
2 and
the critical point veries (as in [6]) :

gc =

1
42

and

cc =

2

(36)

the use of the loop equations method here may be useful as eq. (35) is the equation

we need to use the renormalization group method of [7, 10, 9].

4 conclusion

in this letter, we have shown that it is possible to solve potts-3 and potts- on 2d random
lattices through the method of the equations of motion. even though this method does
not seem to provide a closed set of equations, a few simple ideas can enable us to solve
these problems. the potts-3 random matrix model was rst treated by j.m. daul in
95 [4], he obtained the bicritical point and its associated exponent. he did not have the
algebraic equation for the resolvent of that model, however. while we were working on this
model with added branching interactions, we had a discussion with p. zinn-justin where
it appeared he had another method to solve potts-3 (and even potts-4) matrix model [5]
with dilution terms. he also obtains algebraic equations for the resolvents. however, our
method is dierent and, since it relies on the use of the equations of motion, it seems
more adapted to the renormalization group method [10, 9]. indeed, we have treated potts
+ branched polymers models in order to compare low q to large q critical lines and, if
possible, renormalization group ows. this corresponds to c < 1 and c > 1 (potts- is a
c = + model) models, and we would like to verify if f. davids conjecture [8], applied
to such models, is right. this work is still in progress, in particular for large q potts +
branched polymers models.

note that u and c may depend, in the most general case, on t+ and t2, the latter
being related to t through the equation of motion : g t2 + (u + 2 c) t = 0. in this article,
we have taken the particular case of c constant and u = 1 + h
