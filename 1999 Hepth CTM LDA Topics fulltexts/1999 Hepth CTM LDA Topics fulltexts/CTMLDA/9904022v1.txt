abstract

the formulation of gravity in 3 + 1 dimensions in which the spin
connection is the basic eld (-frame) leads to a theory with rst
and second class constraints. here, the dirac brackets for the sec-
ond class constraints are evaluated and the dirac algebra of rst class
constraints is found to be the usual algebra associated to space-time
reparametrizations and tangent space rotations. this establishes the
classical equivalence with the vierbein approach (e-frame). the ex-
plicit form of the path integral for this theory is given and the quantum
equivalence with the e-frame is also established.

1 introduction

the standard description of the spacetime geometry in general relativity
uses the metric tensor g as the fundamental eld. in hamiltonian form,
the action is a functional of the spatial metric hij and its canonical mo-
mentum ij, as well as four lagrange multipliers associated with spatial
reparametrizations, n i (shifts) and normal deformations, n  (lapse) [1, 2]1.
the einstein-hilbert action can also be written in terms of the spin con-
nection ab
 and their exterior derivatives (rst order
formalism)[3, 4]. in this form, the hamiltonian construction needed to iden-
tify the dynamical degrees of freedom is not straightforward. the torsion

tensor does not vanish identically, but only as a consequence of the classical
equations. thus, it is not legitimate to eliminate the spin connection for the
vierbein and one is left with a theory for 40 independent elds ab
(18), and
i
ea
i (12). also, many of the elds do not have time derivatives: out of the 40,
only 12 have time derivatives in the lagrangian. this gives rise to a number
of rst and second class constraints.

1.1 the two frames

an additional diculty is that there are two natural choices of coordinates
and momenta, which have radically dierent phase space and constraint
structure. thus, two options arise, depending on whether the lagrangian
involves only time derivatives of the vierbein (e-frame), or the spin connec-
tion (-frame). these two choices are related by a canonical transformation
(they dier by a total derivative) and therefore should be classically identi-
cal in content2. however, as the corresponding phase spaces are so radically
dierent, proving the equivalence even at the classical level is non trivial.

to make the discussion more concrete, let us recall some facts about the
rst order formulation of gravity. the rst order lagrangian is the einstein-
hilbert four-form (wedge product of forms is understood)

leh = abcdrabeced + db,

(1)

where rab = dab + a
c cb is the curvature two-form,  is the spin connec-
tion one-form, e is the vierbein one-form and db stands for some arbitrary
boundary term. dierent choices of b(e, ) give rise to dierent choices of
canonical coordinates (frames). two natural choices are:

1.1.1 the e-frame

in the hamiltonian analysis of this action in rst order form [6] the spin
connection splits in two pieces. one of them corresponds to the canonical

2it is extremely dicult to establish the quantum mechanical equivalence between
canonically related formulations of a theory, and the equivalence may not even exist. it
has been shown that quantum mechanics could be formulated in a way that is invariant
under the simpler class of point canonical transformations [5], but a similar proof for
general canonical transformations is not yet known.

momentum of the tetrad eld, and the other corresponds to a set of auxiliary
variables that can be eliminated from their own equations of motion in terms
of the tetrad. the resulting hamiltonian is a functional of the tetrad and its
canonical momentum only, and the spin connection drops out. in this way
the usual vierbein formulation of gravity is obtained [7].

1.1.2 the -frame

alternatively, one can start from the einstein-hilbert action, eliminate the
tetrad eld and build a hamiltonian action that depends on the spin connec-
tion and its canonical momentum only [8]. a preliminary discussion of the
equivalence between the  and e-frames was presented in [9]. in this letter
we want address some points of the analysis in the -frame.

1.1.3 the ashtekar approach

the alternative approach to canonical gravity proposed by ashtekar [10] in
the past decade is yet another canonically equivalent description of general
relativity. the ashtekar frame is obtained through a complex canonical
transformation from the e-frame [11]. it has been often discussed whether
ashtekars theory is quantum mechanically equivalent to standard metric
gravity and the answer still seems uncertain and possibly irrelevant. as we
show here, the  and e-frames are not only equivalent classically through a
real canonical transformation but, if there were a quantum description for
either one, it would be equivalent to the quantum description for the other.

2 first order formalism (in the  frame)

as shown in [8, 9], dropping the boundary term in (1), the rst order action
for gravity in 3+1 dimensions can also be written as3

i[w, e] = z ( ab

k abcdijkec

i ed

3our conventions are that ijk = 1, 0 is a tensor density of weight 1 (i.e., it transforms
like a tensor of third rank times g). hence, ijk  gilgjmgknlmn is also a tensor density
of weight 1, but it takes values g, 0.

the presence of the constraint ij = 0 deserves some discussion. the
substitution of p k

independent elds (ea

of the 6 spurious elds is enforced by the 6 conditions ij = 0. the jacobian

once the second class constraints have been eliminated, hi and jab be-
come the generators of spatial diemorphism and local rotations, respectively.

preservation in time of the constraint ij = 0 implies a new constraint

where the parentheses indicate symmetrization in k, l. preservation of kl =
0 in turn, implies

n{h, kl} + mn{mn, kl} = 0.

(9)

these are equation for the lagrange multipliers, which can be solved for 
because the constraints mn = kl = 0 obey a second class algebra,

{mn(x), kl(y)} = 0
{mn(x), kl(y)} 6= 0
{ij(x), mn(y)} = g1/2bijmn(x, y)

= g1/2(gijmn(g(x)) + gijmn((x)))(x  y).

where gijmn(a) is the inverse supermetric for a symmetric matrix aij 4

gijkl(a) = 2aijakl  ailakj  aikalj.

(10)

(11)

the precise form of {, } is not essential as we will see below. the matrix
bijmn(x, y) has a formal inverse bijmn given by the series

b = g(g)  g(g)g1()g(g) + g(g)g1()g(g)g1()g(g) + ...

(12)

where we have dened g  gijkl, b  bijkl, g1  gijkl, etc.
surface  = 0,  = 0. in this way we can solve (9) for ij,

obviously bijmn coincides with the supermetric gijmn on the constraint

ij =

bijmnn{h, mn}.

(13)

thus no new constraints appear from the preservation in time of . the
initial h has nonvanishing poisson brackets with  or , but the modied

the dirac bracket for two arbitry functionals u, v is given by:

{u, v } = {u, v }  {u, }b{, v }

{u, }b{, v }  {u, }b{, }b{, v },

where sum and integration over discrete and continuous indices is assumed.
it can be shown that when u and v belong to the set { h, hi, jab}, the
second term of the right hand side of (18) vanishes on the constraint surface
 = 0,  = 0. in particular, direct subtitution in (18) yields

{ h, h} = {h, h} = {h, h}.

and using the results of [8], we nally have

{h, h}  gijhji(x, y).

(19)

(20)

in the same way, the complete dirac algebra can be shown to be given by

{h[n], h[m]} = z [(in)m  (im)n]gij(p )hj,

{h[n], hi[m i]} = z (m iin  n im i)h,
{hi[m i], hj[m j]} = z (n llm m  m lln m)hm,

{j[n ab], j[m cd]} = z j[(m  n)ab],

(21)

(22)

(23)

(24)

6

{j[n ab], h[m]} = 0,
{j[n ab], h[m i]} = 0.

(25)

(26)

thus, the dirac algebra reduces to a direct sum of the usual algebra of
spacetime dieomorphism plus tangent space rotations.

note that when p k

ab is replaced by its expresion in terms of the tetrad,
the ij constraints vanish identically, but the secondary constraints ij do
not. in the vierbein frame [6] it can also be shown that prior to eliminating
the auxiliary variables, apart from jab, h, hi the constraints

ij = e(i

a mnj) t a

mn = 0,

(27)

are found, where t a
ij are the spatial components of the torsion tensor, and
ei
a  eaj gij. equation (27) is one of the eld equations, from which the
auxiliary variables ij can be eliminated. replacing p i
k in the
denition (8), ij can be identied with ij in the e-frame.

ab = ijkabcdec

jed

the algebra (2126) is the same as the one found in the vielbein-frame
once the contraint ij is strongly set equal to zero. the two frames can be
compared and contrasted in the following table:

(here ij has been eliminated in the e-frame). the number of propagating
degrees of freedom is g = c  f  1
2 s, where c is the number of coordinates,
f the number of rst class constraints and s the number of second class
constraints.

4 path integral

we now consider the path integral for this system. as shown in [14], the
path integral for a system with second class constraints ,  has a measure
proportional to

()()detc ,

where c  is the dirac matrix. in our case, c  as given in (16) and (10),
yields

detc  = det(gijmn(g) + gijmn()).

the delta functions in (28) restrict the integration to the constraint surface
 = 0,  = 0, so path integral reads
