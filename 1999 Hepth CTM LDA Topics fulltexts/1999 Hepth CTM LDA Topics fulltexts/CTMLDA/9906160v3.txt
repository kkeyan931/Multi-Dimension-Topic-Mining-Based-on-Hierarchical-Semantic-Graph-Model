abstract

we present and analyze exact solutions of the einsteinmaxwell and einsteinmaxwell
dilaton equations that describe static pairs of oppositely charged extremal black holes,
i.e., black diholes. the holes are suspended in equilibrium in an external magnetic eld,
or held apart by cosmic strings. we comment as well on the relation of these solutions to
braneantibrane congurations in string and m-theory.

exact solutions of general relativity describing multiple black holes are few and far between.
indeed one would expect such congurations to have in general a very complicated structure.
luckily, there exist some simple solutions exhibiting remarkable properties. for instance, the
majumdarpapapetrou solutions [1] describe an arbitrary number of static extremal charged
black holes, all with charges of the same sign. equilibrium is possible due to the cancellation
of the gravitational attraction against electric or magnetic repulsion. in other cases, such as
in the multi-schwarzschild solution in [2], the masses are arranged in a linear conguration,
and since the gravitational attraction between them is unbalanced, conical singularities arise
along the symmetry axis. other solutions describe black holes in relative motion, such as
in the cosmological multi-black hole solutions of [3], or in the c and ernst metrics [4, 5],
where two black holes accelerate apart. in this paper we want to report on a dierent class
of solutions, which describe two static extremal magnetic black holes, this time with charges
of opposite signs. the conguration therefore possesses a magnetic dipole moment, and can
be appropriately called a dihole. in order to maintain the black holes in static equilibrium an
external force has to be provided. this will appear in the form of a magnetic eld aligned with
the dihole. otherwise, conical singularities (which may be interpreted as cosmic strings) will
appear in the solution.

the diholes we will exhibit are solutions of einsteinmaxwell theory, possibly coupled to
a dilaton. the latter case includes in particular kaluzaklein theory, for which the dihole
consists of a monopoleantimonopole pair described previously in [6]. dipole congurations
have become of recent interest also within the broader context of string and m-theory, as
describing braneantibrane congurations [7]. near the end, we will explain that much of what
we will describe below has direct relevance in that context. other recent papers studying
selfgravitating dipole solutions in string theory include [8].

the starting point in the construction of the new dihole solutions will be certain exact
solutions that are known to carry magnetic dipole moment [9, 10]. we will see later that,
even in the absence of an external magnetic eld, these solutions admit an interpretation as
dihole congurations, although conical singularities will be present in general. for simplicity
of presentation, and also because it is presumably the most important case, we will study rst
the dihole in einsteinmaxwell theory. the extension to dilaton theories will then be a rather
straightforward task.

several years ago [9] bonnor constructed a solution of einsteinmaxwell theory describing

a magnetic dipole, with metric

the solution is asymptotically at, static and axially symmetric. from the asymptotic behavior
of gtt it is easy to deduce that the mass of the solution is 2m. the magnetic dipole moment
of the solution,  = 2ma, becomes evident by examining the asymptotic form of the potential
(2). changing the sign of a amounts simply to reversing the orientation of the dipole, so we
will consider, without loss of generality, a  0. for m = 0 the solution is exactly at. it was
noticed in [9] that singularities occur at r = r+ = m + m 2 + a2, where  vanishes. our aim
is, rst, to study the structure of the singularity at r = r+, and show that it can be removed by
the introduction of an external magnetic eld. then, having the new solution with an external
magnetic eld, we will argue that at the endpoints of the r = r+ line, i.e., at (r = r+,  = 0) and
(r = r+,  = ) lie two oppositely charged extremal reissner-nordstrom black holes, i.e., the
solution describes a dihole. it will be clear then that the role played by the external magnetic
eld is to balance the attraction, gravitational and magnetic, between the black holes.

let us then study the locus of r = r+. crucially, observe that the axial killing vector 
vanishes there. this means that r = r+ is to be thought of as part of the symmetry axis of
the solution. we are used to thinking of the lines  = 0,  as forming the axis of symmetry.
however, in the present situation the endpoints of these two semi-axes do not come to join at a
common point. rather, the axis of symmetry is completed by the segment r = r+. as  varies
from 0 to  we move along this segment from one endpoint to the other, see fig. 1.

the obvious thing to study now is whether conical singularities appear on the dierent
portions of the symmetry axis. if c is the proper length of a circumference around the axis, and
r is its proper radius, then the presence of a conical decit  means that (dc/dr)|r0 = 2.
take  to be periodically identied with period . then the conical decit along the axes

and therefore would vanish with the standard choice  = 2. however, the conical decit
along the line r = r+,

(r+) = 2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

does not cancel with that same choice for . in fact  = 2 gives a conical excess. this
is, there is a strut along the segment r = r+. we can see the physical origin of the strut as
providing the internal stress (pressure) needed to counterbalance the attraction between the
poles.

instead of eliminating the conical defect outside the dipole, the period  can be chosen
to cancel the singularity along r = r+. with such a choice one nds a conical decit running
along the axes  = 0, , from the endpoints of the dipole to innity. we can view such defects
as cosmic strings, with tension

the dipole is then suspended by open cosmic strings that pull from its endpoints. the line
r = r+, 0 <  < , joining these is now completely non-singular.

although the proper length of the segment r = r+, 0     is innite, the parameter
a gives, in a sense, an indication of the separation between the poles. for large values of
a the force required to keep the dipole static becomes t  m 2
2a2 , which decreases as a2 as
expected from a newtonian approximation to the attraction between poles. notice however
that in the limit a  0 the tension tends to a nite limit t  1/4. in this limit the magnetic
dipole moment of the solution vanishes but nevertheless one does not recover the schwarzschild
solution. rather, a nakedly singular solution appears, with higher massmultipoles [9].

the recourse to cosmic strings to account for the conical singularities of the metric might
appear as a rather ad hoc prescription. from a physical standpoint it appears that an external
magnetic eld aligned with the dipole should be able to provide the necessary force to balance
the attraction between the poles, by pulling apart the dipole endpoints. by adequately tuning
the magnetic eld, the stresses along the axis should be made to disappear.

it is indeed possible to introduce such a magnetic eld by means of a harrison transfor-
mation [11] on the solution. in doing so we proceed in a manner entirely analogous to ernsts
elimination of the conical singularities of the c-metric [5]. the harrison transformation of

3

einstein-maxwell theory takes an axisymmetric solution to another solution containing a mag-
netic eld that asymptotes to the melvin magnetic universe [12]. this is a ux tube that
provides the best possible approximation to a uniform magnetic eld in general relativity.

for an axisymmetric solution of the einstein-maxwell theory with gi = ai = 0 for i 6= ,

the harrison transformation acts as

g = 2g ,

gij = 2gij

where k is an arbitrary constant that can be chosen so as to remove dirac strings.

we apply now this transformation to the bonnor solution, eqs. (1) and (2), and obtain,

after some algebra, and choosing k = 2/b,

it is straightforward to see that as r   the solution approaches the same limit as the melvin
universe with axial magnetic eld b. let us investigate now the conical structure along the
symmetry axis. along the outer semi-axes,  = 0, , we nd the same value for the conical
defect as in (4), so, in order to set (0,) = 0, we will choose  = 2. on the other hand,
along the inner segment of the axis, r = r+, we nd now

(r+  a)2 .

there are two branches of solutions, one with b > 0 and another one with b < 0 (recall that
we are taking a  0). for the rst branch, in the limit a   the eld goes to zero like

4

b  m
2a2 , whereas for a  0 the eld tends to a non-zero value b  1/(2m). in the second
branch b  2/m as a  . an analogous branch structure was found in [13] for the ernst
metric, where the second branch was found to be somewhat anomalous. we will not discuss
that here, and in the following we will only consider the rst branch of solutions (upper signs)
in (12). observe that values of b larger than (12) would have yielded a cosmic string stretching
along the dipole, a dumbbell conguration similar to that considered in [14].

we have therefore succeeded in removing the conical singularities of the bonnor dipole
solution. however, the metric still becomes singular at the endpoints of the dipole, (r =
r+,  = 0) and (r = r+,  = ). remarkably, we can show that these singularities are merely
artifacts of the coordinate system. in order to do so, let us study the geometry of the region
very close to these points. to this eect, change the coordinates (r, ) to (, ) as1

r = r+ +

(1 + cos ) ,

sin2  =

m 2 + a2

(1  cos ) ,

(13)

and take  to be much smaller than any other length scale involved so as to get near the poles.
in this limit the solution becomes, near (r = r+,  = 0),

where

ds2 =

(16)

this is precisely the bertottirobinson solution, ads2  s2, which describes the near horizon
limit of an extreme reissnernordstrom black hole with charge q. in a similar way, at the
other endpoint (r = r+,  = ) we nd the same geometry but this time with the opposite
charge2. therefore, the solution contains regular horizons at the poles, and it can be continued
beyond  = 0.

apparently, the eld b has no eect down the throat (14). but, crucially, realize that in
order to arrive at (14) the eld b is required to take precisely the value (12). it is illuminating
to see how things change for other values of b. if we keep b arbitrary, then the limiting form
of the solution near the poles is

1a similar change was performed in [7] in a study of the kaluzaklein dipole, which can be recovered as a

particular case of solutions described below.

(18)

is a function such that g() = 1 when the eld b is tuned to the value (12). the important
point is that in general the surface  = 0 is still a horizon, albeit not one of spherical symmetry.
instead, the horizon is a prolate spheroid, which is further distorted by a conical defect at either
pole. we want to stress that the horizons are present even for the case of the bonnor dipole
(b = 0). as far as we know, this crucial feature of the bonnor solution (1) has gone unnoticed
in all previous literature.

the gauge eld near the horizon is also distorted from its monopolar form to

a = q

(19)

the physical magnetic charge of the hole can now be computed using gausss law, q = 1
(s2 is any topological sphere surrounding the charge) so, in general, the actual physical charge
of the hole is not q, but rather

(20)

the limiting geometries above were valid for arbitrary values of a, as long as we remain
close enough to the pole. if, instead, we consider the limit of very large a, while keeping r  r+
and a sin2  nite, the solution (8) tends to

ds2 =  1 +

q

!2

dt2 + 1 +

q

!2

[d2 + 2(d2 + sin2 d2)] ,

(21)

with q  m, and a as in (15). we recognize this as the extremal reissnernordstrom black
hole. in the limit a   the magnetic eld b vanishes, consistently with the interpretation
that the poles are innitely apart from each other and the force between them goes to zero.
incidentally, note that if one wanted to consider an adiabatic process where the two black holes
held in equilibrium are taken apart, then the magnetic eld would obviously have to be adjusted
at every moment in such a way that the eld precisely balances the forces for xed values of
the charge of each hole (20).

so we conclude that our solution (8), (9) indeed describes a dihole. in general, for nite
values of a, the geometry of the black holes is distorted from their asymptotically at form (21),
but, for the particular value of b in (12), the distortion becomes inappreciable well down the
throat, where we recover the near horizon geometry (14). moreover, the innite proper distance

6

along the dipole line r = r+ is now seen as a consequence of the innite throat characteristic
of extremal reissnernordstrom black holes.

the dihole character of the dipole solution brings about some interesting consequences (now
we restrict ourselves to the solution with b given by the upper sign solution in (12)). there
is a nonvanishing area associated to the horizon of each of the black holes, and therefore an
entropy. this is easily obtained from (14) as s = ah/4 = q2 for each hole.

in the limit of large separation between the holes we would expect a newtonian approxi-
mation to become reasonable. indeed, for large a, the magnetic eld b exerts the right force,
t  qb  q2/(2a2) to counterbalance the attraction between two particles at a distance of
the order of a.

as a  0, though, there is the peculiarity that the black holes in (8) never appear to merge.
for a = 0 the solution is nonsingular (outside the horizons), and is to be interpreted as the
conguration of minimal separation between the black holes. it corresponds to a maximum
value for qb, namely (qb)max = 1.

we have mentioned that the mass of the dipole was, for bonnors asymptotically at solu-
tion, equal to 2m. the solution (8), (9) is instead asymptotic to the melvin universe, but it is
still possible to compute its energy by taking the melvin universe as the reference background,
following [15]. the result is that the energy is still equal to 2m. in the limit of large separation
the mass of each black hole (21) is m, so the total energy is the sum of the energies of the
separate black holes. thus, for innite separation the interaction energy vanishes, as could
have been expected.

now, at nite values of a we would expect to nd a nonvanishing interaction energy. given
that extremal black holes in isolation satisfy mbh = q, we can estimate the interaction energy
in the dipole as

eint = etotal  2mbh = 2m  2q = 

.

(22)

2m 2

m 2 + a2

this is negative, reecting the attraction between the black holes. for xed black hole charge
q, this energy is minimized when a = 0. notice that the value as a  0 is eint = 2m.

now let us turn to the generalization of these diholes to theories with a dilaton eld . the

action we consider is

i =

1

16g z d4x g(cid:16)r  2()2  e2f 2(cid:17) .

(23)

for dilaton coupling  = 0 we will recover the results discussed above. the case of 2 = 3
corresponds to kaluzaklein theory, and in this case the solutions admit nice geometric inter-
pretations. the kaluzaklein analog of the bonnor dipole was identied in [16]. the intro-
duction of the background magnetic eld, together with a thorough analysis of the structure of
the solutions and extensions to higher dimensions, was undertaken in [6].

7

for arbitrary values of the dilaton coupling, the counterparts of the bonnor dipole were
obtained in [10]. the conical singularity along the axis was correctly identied there. indeed,
a straightforward calculation like the one in (5) shows that the conical decit is present for
arbitrary values of . more importantly, we will nd that the entire dihole structure reveals
itself for any value of , in a manner entirely analogous to the einsteinmaxwell dihole. this
is at variance with the conclusions in [10], an issue we will return to below, after completing
our analysis.

it is a straightforward matter to take the dipole solutions in [10] and subject them to a

dilatonic harrison transformation [17]. the resulting metric is

and  and  still given by (3).

the analysis of these solutions can be carried out in the same manner as above for the
einsteinmaxwell dihole, only in this case at the poles we nd extremal dilatonic holes, the
horizons being replaced by null singularities. the solutions asymptote to the dilaton melvin
solutions of [18]. the value of the magnetic eld that removes all conical singularities is

in these coordinates it is easy to compute the scalar curvature near the poles r = r+,  = 0, 
since these loci correspond to  = 0. one nds

(31)

where f () is a certain function which is regular for 0    . we can see that the scalar
curvature diverges at  = 0 except when  = 0. thus  = 0 (i.e., r = r+,  = 0, ) is, for  6= 0,
a real singularity. but this is just the well-known null singularity of extremal dilatonic holes.
these holes do not have any bekensteinhawking entropy associated. the proper distance
between the holes for  6= 0 is nite, since in that case the proper distance to the (singular)
horizon of each hole (28) is known to be nite. besides, for values of b other than (27) the
geometry around the singular horizon is angularly deformed in a manner similar to (17).

a very dierent interpretation of the geometry was proposed in [10], where it was claimed
that for  = 1 (and only for that value) regular non-extremal horizons are present at the
poles r = r+,  = 0, . the analysis of [10] was based on a study of certain two-dimensional
sections of the solution, in particular of the geometry of the two-dimensional section given by
r = r+,  = constant. it was pointed out in that paper that the intrinsic curvature of this
two-dimensional metric is divergent at  = 0,  unless  = 1. however, such a restricted two-
dimensional study cannot be conclusive, if only for the fact that singularities of a submanifold do
not in general correspond to singularities of the full manifold. the analysis is indeed misleading:
the full four-dimensional structure of the solutions near the poles is manifested using the
coordinates (t, , , ) as introduced in (13), and then eq. (31) explictly shows that only  = 0
yields a non-singular four-dimensional curvature at  = 0. this is just as expected from the
fact that we have recovered the geometries near the horizon of extremal charged dilatonic black
holes, of which only the pure einstein-maxwell case possesses a regular horizon. the standard
analysis of the structure near the horizon of the extremal reissner-nordstrom black hole and
its limiting bertotti-robinson geometry can be equally well applied to (14).
in particular,
future directed geodesics can cross each of the horizons at each pole, so at both poles we
have future horizons. since the geometry is symmetric under time-reversal there are also past

9

horizons. also, the coordinates can be extended in the standard manner beyond the horizons.
this forms the basis of our claim that the non-dilatonic solution describes a time-symmetric
conguration with two extremal black holes, each with a future and a past horizon. this is
obviously at variance with the claim in [10] of a non-extremal white hole (a past horizon) at
one pole and a black hole (a future horizon) at the other pole for  = 1 (and a singularity
for  6= 1). actually, this time-asymmetric interpretation is another artifact of the restriction
to the two-dimensional submanifold mentioned above. we would also like to stress that our
interpretation is in consonance with the one given in [6] for the case  = 3, and extends it in
a natural way to other values of .

let us now discuss some generic aspects of the dihole solutions we have constructed. first
of all, we have shown that the solutions of [9] and [10] are properly interpreted, for arbitrary
values of the dilaton coupling, as diholes, with the holes being kept in equilibrium by strings
or struts. the horizon of each hole is deformed by the eld created by the other hole, as
well as by the conical defect. we have found that an external eld can be applied and tuned
so as to balance the system and remove the conical singularities. in that case, the external
eld precisely cancels the eld created by the other hole, with the eect that the distortion
disappears and the horizon is spherically symmetric.

on the other hand, the conical defects that pull apart the holes in the bonnor dihole can
be made more physical by regarding them as the limit of selfgravitating vortices that end on
the black holes. therefore they add to the catalog of solutions describing cosmic strings ending
on black holes [20, 14].

another aspect to note is that the congurations are expected to be unstable. on physical
grounds it is clear that a slight deviation from the equilibrium conguration should set the
black holes either in runaway motion away from each other, or collapsing onto one another.
as a matter of fact, the instability of the dihole is known to be present for the a = 0 solution
in the kaluzaklein case  = 3. in that case the solution can be related to the euclidean
schwarzschild instanton, which is known to have an unstable mode [21].

indeed, the instability of these solutions ts in nicely with the existence of instantons de-
scribing the pair creation of black holes in an external eld [19] or in the breaking of a cosmic
string [20]. the diholes are to be seen as the sphalerons sitting on top of the potential barrier,
under which the tunneling process takes place. thus, the dihole solutions in this paper are
closely linked to the c and ernst type of solutions that describe black holes accelerating apart
[4, 5, 17].

we have mentioned as well that, when held in the external eld, it does not appear to be
possible to bring the black holes close enough to make them merge. fixing the charge, there
is an upper limiting value for the magnetic eld, which is approached as a  0 for the branch
with b > 0. in this limit the two-black hole structure still persists. this might be seen as

10

providing support for the cosmic censorship conjecture: the merging of the reissnernordstrom
black holes, which would imply the annihilation of charge and possibly a change in the spatial
topology, might have led to a naked singularity. nevertheless, notice that for the bonnor dihole
kept in equilibrium by cosmic strings, the black holes actually merge as a  0, and then form a
singularity. however, these tests must be taken with a pinch of salt, since given the instability
of the solutions, a gedanken experiment in which the black holes are slowly moved towards one
another does not appear to be physically realizable. related analyses of cosmic censorship can
be found in [13].

several extensions of the work presented in this paper seem possible. first of all, it is clear
that electric diholes can be constructed simply by dualizing the magnetic eld to an electric
eld. more interesting are generalizations to theories with a richer eld content. dilaton black
holes with coupling  = 0, 1/3, 1,3 are known to occur in the low energy description of
string and m-theory compactied down to four dimensions. they admit an interpretation
in terms of branes intersecting in higher dimensions, with all the longitudinal and relative
transverse coordinates being compactied. as one example among many possible embeddings,
the reissnernordstrom black hole can be obtained as an intersection of e.g., four equally
charged d3-branes [22]. we can lift our solution (8) to ten dimensions by suitably adding at
dimensions, and then interpret it as an intersecting brane-antibrane conguration. a similar
lift can also be done for the solutions with the other three special values of .

now, when the charges of the branes are not equal to one another, the four dimensional
black holes appear as solutions to theories with four u(1) gauge elds and three independent
scalars [23]. it is likely that dihole solutions for these theories can be constructed. indeed, the
existence of c and ernsttype metrics in such u(1)4 theories, describing pairs of black holes
accelerating apart [24] strongly suggests that it should be possible to construct their static
dihole counterparts.3

on the other hand, it is less clear how to obtain non-extreme diholes. also, one might spec-
ulate on the possibility that the dihole be held in equilibrium not by an external magnetic eld,
but rather by the expansion produced by a positive cosmological constant. to our knowledge,
such solutions have not been constructed yet.
