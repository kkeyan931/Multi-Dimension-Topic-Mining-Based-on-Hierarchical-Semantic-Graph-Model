abstract

we study the spectrum of the qcd dirac operator for two colors with fermions in
the fundamental representation and for two or more colors with adjoint fermions. for
nf avors, the chiral avor symmetry of these theories is spontaneously broken according
to su(2nf )  sp(2nf ) and su(nf )  o(nf ), respectively, rather than the symmetry
breaking pattern su(nf )  su(nf )  su(nf ) for qcd with three or more colors
and fundamental fermions. in this paper we study the dirac spectrum for the rst two
symmetry breaking patterns. following previous work for the third case we nd the dirac
spectrum in the domain   qcd by means of partially quenched chiral perturbation
theory. in particular, this result allows us to calculate the slope of the dirac spectrum
at  = 0. we also show that for   1/l2qcd (with l the linear size of the system)
the dirac spectrum is given by a chiral random matrix theory with the symmetries the
dirac operator.

1. introduction

perhaps the most important reason for the current interest in the infrared sector of
the euclidean dirac spectrum is its relation with the chiral condensate by means of the
banks-casher formula [1]. in this way the properties of the smallest eigenvalues of the
dirac operator may be related to the mechanisms of chiral symmetry breaking and to
the nature of the chiral phase transition as observed in lattice qcd simulations [2, 3].
however, this is not the only reason for our interest in this part of the dirac spectrum.
what may be more important ultimately is that it is one of the few examples where exact
nonperturbative analytical results can be derived from qcd.

one of the main objectives of this paper is to study the qcd dirac spectrum in the
domain   qcd. in particular we calculate the slope of the dirac spectrum near  = 0.
this problem was rst addressed in a paper by smilga and stern [4]. they studied the
slope of the dirac spectrum for the case of three or more colors with fermions in the
fundamental representation.
in this article we extend previous results [4, 5, 6] to the
case of qcd with two colors and fundamental fermions and qcd with adjoint fermions.
before discussing our strategy let us rst summarize the approach followed by smilga
and stern. they studied the scalar susceptibility which, in terms of the spectral density
averaged over the euclidean qcd action,

is given by

() = xk h(  k)i,

k ab = abz 

0

()(m2  2)
(m2 + 2)2 d.

(1)

(2)

their idea was to derive k ab from chiral perturbation theory and invert this relation to
obtain information on the dirac spectrum. because of the implicit mass dependence of
() via the fermion determinant in the statistical average over gauge eld congurations
such inversion is not possible in general. they found that

k ab  ab n 2

f  4
nf

log(m/),

(3)

where  is the momentum cuto of the one-loop integral. their crucial observation was
that the contribution to the integral (2) from the chiral logarithms in (0) cancels because

z 

0

(0)(m2  2)
(m2 + 2)2 d = 0.

(4)
barring any more exotic  dependence of () such as for example m log m, the loga-
rithmic mass dependence of the scalar susceptibility results entirely from the linear term
in ().

2

however, there is another approach to extract the dirac spectrum directly from the
low energy eective partition function which does not suer from the above mentioned
ambiguities in the mass dependence [7, 5, 6]. the starting point of this approach is the
so called partially quenched partition function dened as [8, 9, 10]

z pq(mv, j) = z [da]

det( /d + mv + j)

det( /d + mv)

nf

yf =1

det( /d + ms) esy m [a] ,

(5)

where /d is the euclidean dirac operator and sy m [a] is the euclidean yang-mills action.
the valence quark mass dependence of the chiral condensate is then given by [11, 7, 12]

(mv) =

1

v hxk

1

mv + iki =

1
v

j|j=0 log z pq(mv, j).

the spectral density then follows from the discontinuity across the imaginary axis

()/v =

1
2

((i + )  (i  )).

(6)

(7)

the valence quark mass dependence of the partition function (5) can be obtained
from its corresponding low-energy eective partition function [13, 9, 10, 14] which is
based on the specic pattern of chiral symmetry breaking. in this way it is possible to
extract exact analytical information on the qcd dirac spectrum in the domain near
zero virtuality. this approach was rst followed in [5, 6] for three or more colors with
fundamental fermions where in addition to extending the result of smilga and stern we
were able to calculate the spectral density of the dirac operator on the scale of the smallest
eigenvalues. in this paper we apply this approach to qcd with two colors with fermions
in the fundamental representation and qcd with adjoint fermions.

a much simpler theory with the global symmetries of the qcd partition function
is chiral random matrix theory (chrmt) [15, 16]. in this theory the matrix elements
of the dirac operator are replaced by gaussian distributed random variables. it turns
out that this does not aect the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking. the separation
into three dierent symmetry classes can be related naturally to the dyson index of the
dirac operator denoted by the symbol . its value is  = 1 for qcd with two colors
and fermions in the fundamental representation, it is  = 2 for qcd with three or more
colors and fermions in the fundamental representation, and it is  = 4 for qcd with
adjoint fermions. the matrix elements of the dirac matrix of the corresponding chrmt
are real, complex and quaternion real, respectively. within chrmt it is possible to
obtain exact analytical expressions for the spectral density and all spectral correlation
functions. as we will see in the next paragraph it is possible to establish a domain where
the spectral correlations of the qcd dirac operator are given by chrmt. alternatively,
the existence of such domain can be understood by means of universality arguments
[17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24].

3

we can distinguish three important scales in the qcd dirac spectrum. they are
most conveniently discussed in terms of the the valence quark mass. the rst scale is
the smallest nonzero eigenvalue of the dirac operator which is of the order of the average
level spacing and is given by

min 


0v

,

(8)

where 0 is the chiral condensate in the chiral limit and v = l4 is the volume of space-
time. the second scale corresponds to the valence quark mass for which the compton
wave length of the associated goldstone boson is equal to the size of the box [7, 25, 5],

mv0
f 2 

1
l2 ,

(9)

as was argued in [7, 25, 5, 6] the valence quark mass dependence of the chiral condensate
is described by chrmt for

mv  mc =

f 2
0l2 .

(10)

the spectral density of the dirac operator, given by the discontinuity of (mv), is therefore
described by chrmt as well in this domain. these results have been conrmed by numer-
ous lattice qcd simulations [26, 7, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40],
instanton liquid simulations [41, 25, 42] and other calculations [43, 44]. for valence quark
masses below this scale the kinetic term in the eective lagrangian can be ignored. in
[5, 6] it was shown that in this regime the valence quark mass dependence that follows
from partially quenched chiral perturbation theory coincides with the result from chrmt.
the dimensionless ratio of the scales (8) and (10)

mc
min 

f 2l2



(11)

represents the approximate number of eigenvalues that are described by chrmt. a scale
analogous to mc occurs in mesoscopic physics where it is known as the thouless energy
[45, 46].

based on the scales

min  mc  qcd,

(12)

we thus can distinguish four dierent domains. with names borrowed from mesoscopic
physics, these scales separate the quantum domain, the ergodic domain, the diusive
domain and the ballistic domain. the valence quark masses can be interpreted in terms
of a conjugate time. then h/mc is the time scale for which a particle diuses over the
length of the system with diusion constant given by f 2/0 [47, 25, 48]. for more

discussion and additional references on impurity scattering in disordered systems and the
thouless energy we refer to [49, 50, 51].

in the domain of validity for chrmt it is natural to study the spectral density in units
of the average level spacing. the corresponding microscopic spectral density is dened by
[15]

s(u) = lim
v 

1
v

(

u
v

).

(13)

in this paper, we will show by means of a perturbative calculation that in the ergodic
domain the microscopic spectral density that follows from partially quenched chiral per-
turbation theory coincides with the result obtained from the chiral random matrix theory
in the same universality class. for smaller values of mv the super-integrations have to be
performed exactly. this has been achieved [5, 6] for the case  = 2 which is mathemati-
cally much simpler than the cases  = 1 and  = 4 [49, 52, 53] and complete agreement
with chrmt was found. it would be interesting to perform a similar calculation for the
other two cases as well.

as second important result of this paper is the derivation of the slope of the dirac
spectrum for qcd with two colors and fundamental fermions and for qcd with adjoint
fermions. we will derive this result in two dierent ways. first, according to the method of
smilga and stern, and second by means of the partially quenched qcd partition function.
we nd that both methods agree thereby excluding a more exotic mass dependence of the
spectral density. our result for the slope of the dirac spectrum for nf massless fermions
can be summarized as

( = 0) =

2
0

162f 4

(nf  2)(nf + )

nf

,

(14)

where 0 is the chiral condensate, f is the pion decay constant and  is the dyson index
of the dirac operator.

in the next two sections we study the symmetry breaking patterns for  = 1 and
 = 4. the slope of the dirac spectrum for these two cases is calculated from standard
chpt in section 4. partially quenched chiral perturbation theory based on supersymme-
try is constructed in section 5. within these eective theories we calculate the valence
quark mass dependence of the chiral condensate. the computations for two colors with
fundamental fermions and adjoint fermions are presented separately in sections 6 and 7,
respectively. some interesting limiting cases and compact expressions for all  are given
in section 8.
in section 9 we show that our results agree with chrmt in the ergodic
domain. we also nd the dirac spectral density for larger eigenvalues, in the diusive
domain, and obtain an expression for its slope. concluding remarks are made in section
10.

2. symmetries of the qcd partition function with two colors and funda-
mental fermions

the qcd partition function for two colors and fundamental fermions is special in
the sense that it is invariant under a larger symmetry group than is the case for more
colors. this well-known fact for qcd with fundamental fermions relies on the pseudo-real
nature of suc(2) [54, 55, 56], and can be easily generalized to the supersymmetric case
[57] relevant to the partially quenched qcd partition function. the discussion in this
section is mainly included for pedagogical reasons and part of it was already given in
reference [58].

the fermionic action is obtained by writing the determinant in the partition function
as a gaussian integral over the grassmann elds  and . using the chiral representation
of the  matrices with

 =   0

+




0 ! ,

(15)

and  = (1, ik) with k the pauli -matrices, the fermionic action can be written as

sf =z d4x

nf

xf =1  r

l !

(16)

for nc = 2, we have that at
with the relation

f
l+

 ( + ia)f

 = 2a2 (with 2 = 2 in color space). combining this

r = f

r22( + ia)22 f
l,

(17)

where we have used that  is anti-hermitian and that the fermion elds are anti-
commuting grassmann variables. the fermionic action can thus be rewritten as

(18)

obviously the symmetry group is gl(2nf ). if the number of left-handed modes is not
equal to the number of right-handed modes because of the anomaly, an axial u(1) is
broken explicitly as for three or more colors.

the mass term is given by

also in this case we expect a maximum spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry consis-
tent with the vafa-witten theorem [59]. this means that only the subgroup of u(2nf )
that leaves both rr and ll invariant remains unbroken. therefore, only the sub-
group that leaves

(20)

invariant remains unbroken ( rr is invariant under the same transformations). this
is the symplectic group sp(2nf ). the goldstone manifold is thus given by the coset
su(2nf )/sp(2nf ).

an analogous argument can be made for bosonic quarks. in that case it is essential
to allow only symmetry transformations that leave the integrals in the partition function
convergent. in that case one nds [57] that the chiral symmetry is broken according to
gl(2, r)  o(2).

the symmetries of the partially quenched partition function for two colors with fun-
damental matter elds can be obtained along similar lines. one easily convinces oneself
that the symmetry of the lagrangian is enhanced to gl(2nf + 2|2) from the usual group
gl(nf + 1|1)  gl(nf + 1|1) for more than two colors. for convergence reasons the
symmetry group has to be restricted to a non-compact group gl(2, r) for the bosonic
quarks. this symmetry is broken spontaneously by the formation of a chiral conden-
sate in the boson-boson sector and the fermion-fermion sector exactly as discussed above.
the remaining symmetry group combines into the ortho-symplectic graded lie group
osp(2nf + 2|2). the goldstone manifold is therefore given by [57] the maximum rie-
mannian submanifold of the coset space gl(2nf + 2|2)/osp(2nf + 2|2). this results
in a integration domain for the the fermion-fermion block given by the symmetric space
u(2nf )/sp(2nf ) and an integration domain for the boson-boson block given by the sym-
metric space gl(2, r)/o(2).

an explicit parameterization of this goldstone manifold is given by

here, i and i are grassmann variables, uf f is an (2nf + 2) (2nf + 2) unitary matrix
and a, b, c and d are real numbers.

3. symmetries of the qcd partition function for adjoint fermions

for qcd with fermions in the adjoint representation the dirac operator is given by

/d =  + f abcaa,

(24)

where the f abc denote the structure constants of the gauge group. in this case, the operator
24( /d + m) is antisymmetric and therefore the square root of the fermion determinant
can be represented as a grassmann integral [60] in the following way

det1/2(24(d + m)) =

z drdl exp"  f

r
f

l ! 24

for simplicity we will consider only even nf . the avor symmetry group is su(nf ) which
acts on the majorana elds as

(25)

  r
l !    u

0 u 1 !  r

l ! .

0

(26)

this symmetry is broken by the chiral condensate which, with maximum breaking of
chiral symmetry consistent with the vafa-witten theorem, is given by (the color index is
denoted by i and the spinor index by )

0 =

2
nf

nf

xf =1h(f

r  if

r  i + f

l  if

l  i)i,

(27)

and is invariant under an o(nf ) subgroup of su(nf ). the goldstone manifold in this
case is thus given by su(nf )/o(nf ).

the square root of an anti-symmetric matrix cannot be represented as an integral
over real bosonic variables. therefore, the above construction fails for bosonic quarks.
however, it is possible to represent the inverse determinant as an integral over complex
variables. if we use that

l+

 ( + f abcaa)r = (2r)( + f abcaa)2 l,

(28)

we observe that the avor symmetry group of the bosonic quarks is doubled. in this case
it turns out [57] that the chiral symmetry is broken according to u (2, r)  sp(2).

8

the symmetry group of the partially quenched lagrangian for matter elds in the
adjoint representation is gl(nf + 2|2). because of convergence reasons only a u (2, r)
subgroup of the boson-boson block of gl(nf +2|2) is a symmetry of the partition function.
this symmetry is broken by the formation of a chiral condensate. with maximum break-
ing of chiral symmetry consistent with the vafa-witten theorem only an osp(2|nf + 2)
subgroup remains unbroken. the goldstone manifold is then given by the maximum rie-
mannian submanifold [57] of the coset space gl(nf + 2|2)/osp(2|nf + 2) with fermion-
fermion integration domain given by u(nf + 2)/o(nf + 2) and boson-boson integration
domain equal to u (2, r)/sp(2).

an explicit representation of this manifold is given by

where

u = v t gav,

4. the scalar susceptibility in chpt

the scalar susceptibility is dened by

k ab = z d4xd4ytrtahx|

/d + m|yitbhy|

/d + m|xi.

(32)

for equal quark masses, the dirac operator is avor diagonal. replacing the spatial
integrals by a sum over the dirac spectrum, we obtain

k ab = 

1

(ik + m)2 .

(33)

by introducing the isovector scalar source term sa qtaq the scalar susceptibility can
be expressed in terms of a derivative of the qcd partition function (notice that the
disconnected contribution vanishes in this case)

k ab = sasb log z.

9

(34)

alternatively, the low-energy limit of the scalar susceptibility can be obtained from
the eective chiral partition function. to lowest order in the momenta and the quark
masses this partition function is determined uniquely by the pattern of chiral symmetry
breaking [61, 62]

the convention trt at b = ab/2. for the three cases under consideration the appropriate

let us rst consider the case  = 2. we already have seen that k ab is diagonal in isospin
space. for the generators ta and tb we conveniently choose

ta = tb =

whereas the o-diagonal generators are given by

and

tkl
s = (ikjl + jkil)/2,

(41)

(42)

(43)

notice that for  = 2 we do not distinguish between t a and ta. for the sum q(2) we thus
obtain

(44)

where the rst term in this equation is due to the diagonal generators and the second
term of this equation is due to the o-diagonal generators.

as usual the case of  = 2 is the simplest case. the next simplest case is  = 4 with
coset space given by su(nf )/o(nf ). in the sum (44) the same diagonal generators enter
as in the case of  = 2. however, only the symmetric o-diagonal generators contribute to
this sum in this case, so that the contribution from the o-diagonal generators is exactly
half of what it was for  = 2. this results in

(46)

where a is a hermitian traceless matrix and bt = b (both are nf  nf matrices).
the sum over the generators is again calculated by distinguishing the diagonal generators

our nal result for k ab can be summarized as

(49)

with the same assumption for the  and m dependence of the spectral density as in [4]
we nd that the slope of the dirac spectrum at the origin is given by

(50)

the slope vanishes for nf = 2 for all three values of . this is in agreement with instanton
simulations [41] performed for the cases of  = 1 and  = 2.

5. partially quenched chiral perturbation theory

the physics of qcd at low energies is completely determined by the spontaneous
symmetry breaking pattern described above [61, 62, 63, 64].
in general, the eective
lagrangian of partially quenched qcd is based on the spontaneous chiral symmetry
breaking pattern of the graded lie-groups g  h. the goldstone elds are given by

u = exp(i2/f),

(51)

where f is the pion decay constant and  = at a with t a the generators of the maximum
riemannian submanifold of g/h (notice that in this representation the mass matrix is
diagonal for all three cases). we use the normalization strt at b = 1
2ab. to lowest order
in the momenta and the quark masses, the euclidean eective lagrangian is obtained in
the very same way as in chiral perturbation theory [61, 62, 13, 9]. this results in

(52)

the last two terms in (52) represent the mass and kinetic terms of the super- avor-
singlet eld 0 = str(). they are introduced for the same symmetry reasons as in the

12

three-color case [13, 9]. below we are only interested in the case that m0  qcd. in
that case the term proportional to  is sub-leading, and it will be ignored from now on.
the eective partition function is given by

the factors in front of the rst two terms in the eective lagrangian (52) have been

in the case of chiral perturbation theory for qcd it is possible to distinguish a domain
where the partition function factorizes in a piece dominated by the zero momentum modes
and a factor involving the nonzero momentum modes [63, 64]. the same is true for the
partially quenched chiral lagrangian. for valence quark masses below the thouless energy

(59)

the uctuations of the zero modes in the the eective partition function dominate the
uctuations of the nonzero momentum modes. then the integral over the zero momentum
modes factorizes from the partition function and the calculation of (mv) is reduced to a
group integral. this integral has been calculated explicitly for  = 2 with the result that
(mv) is in complete agreement with chiral random matrix theory.

6. calculation of (mv) for  = 1

from a computational point of view, two-color pqchpt is not very dierent from
three-color pqchpt [9]. to perform a calculation to one-loop order one has to construct
the meson propagator. the eective lagrangian discussed in previous section is based on
the symmetric super-space gl(2nf + 2|2)/osp(2nf + 2|2). an explicit representation of
 in (51) in terms of a (2nf + 4)  (2nf + 4) matrix eld is given by

mesons made of quark and anti-quarks, the nf + 1-vectors v, w, v and w represent
the fermionic mesons consisting of a ghost quark and an ordinary anti-quark, and nally
the real elds v, w and vw are the mesons with two ghost quarks. with the proper
normalization of the elds the hermitian matrix eld  is given by

to second order in the pion elds there is no mixing between the o-diagonal goldstone
modes. however, because of the term str2, the situation is more complicated for the
diagonal goldstone modes. the propagator of these modes is obtained by inverting the
quadratic form in the eective lagrangian obtained by expanding the u elds up to second
order. the mixing matrix of the diagonal mesons is given by

m (1) =

the quenched limit is obtained in the limit of innite sea quark masses at xed values
of m0 and mv. standard chpt power counting rules are recovered when the super-
decouples, that is when the singlet mass m0 is sent to innity. it is easy to check that in
this case the propagator (68) in the sea quark sector is just the standard propagator in
a quark basis with the singlet channel projected out. finally, if both the valence and sea
quark masses are set equal, we recover the standard result for two-color chpt.

the valence quark mass dependence of the chiral condensate is computed as in the
three color case [10, 5]. since we are mainly interested in the non-analytic valence quark
mass dependence of the chiral condensate, we will perform a one-loop computation, and
we will ignore the analytic corrections coming from the o(p4) eective lagrangian.

the usual tadpole diagrams have to be evaluated. at nite volume, the pion propa-

gator at the origin is

(m 2) =

(69)

where the sum is over the momenta in the box. in the thermodynamic limit the sum can
be replaced by an integral resulting in (in four euclidean dimensions)

(m 2) =

where  is the cuto.

it is now straightforward to calculate the valence quark mass dependence of the chiral

condensate. collecting the dierent contributions we nd

the rst term in the rst equation is due to the o-diagonal mesons consisting out of a
valence quark and a sea quark, the second term is due to the diagonal meson consisting
out of two valence quarks, and the last term is due to mesons consisting out of a bosonic
and a fermionic quarks. as usual there is an additional minus sign for fermionic meson
loops.

7. calculation of (mv) for  = 4

for fermions in the adjoint representation the goldstone manifold is determined by

the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking according to

gl(nf + 2|2)  osp(2|nf + 2).

(72)

the goldstone manifold is given by the maximum riemannian submanifold of gl(nf +
2|2)/osp(2|nf +2). the eective lagrangian has exactly the same structure as for  = 1,
but in this case an explicit representation of the goldstone modes is given by

in order to do a one-loop calculation we need an explicit expression for the pion
propagator. because of the singlet mass term the inversion of the quadratic form involving
the diagonal mesons is nontrivial. the propagator of the diagonal mesons is given by

8. valence quark mass dependence of the chiral condensate and the dyson
index

before studying the valence quark mass dependence of the chiral condensate in ve
dierent limiting cases we write (mv) as a single formula valid for all three dierent
values of .

the result for the valence quark mass dependence of the chiral condensate for gauge
elds in the fundamental representation and three or more colors was obtained previously
[10, 5]. in our present notation the result can be rewritten as

sv) + g(2)

vv  (m 2

vv)o(cid:21) .

(81)

with dyson index  of the dirac operator equal to  = 1 for qcd with two colors and
fermions in the fundamental representation,  = 2 for three or more colors and fermions
in the fundamental representation, and  = 4 for two or more colors in the adjoint
representation, the result for the three dierent cases considered above can be written as

()(mv) = 0"1

notice that this propagator becomes independent of  in the limit m0   when the
usual chpt counting rules prevail. previously, a similar unied description was obtained

18

for sum-rules for the inverse eigenvalues of the dirac operator [16, 56]. below we will
discuss ve limiting cases for (mv) obtained in (82).
i) in the limit mv = ms  m0 we should recover the mass dependence of the chiral
condensate in standard chiral perturbation theory. in this case with mvv = mss = m,
the diagonal propagator reduces to

g()

vv =

nf  1

nf

(m 2),

and the expression for (mv) can be written as

()(mv) = 0"1

(nf  1)(1 + 2nf /)

nf

(m 2)# .

(84)

(85)

we observe that for nf = 1 the result is independent of the dyson index . indeed, in
this case the only axial symmetry is broken explicitly by the anomaly for all three values
of . the factor (nf  1)(1 + 2nf /) exactly counts the number of goldstone bosons
which is equal to the number of generators of su(2nf )/sp(2nf ) for  = 1, the number
of generators of su(nf ) for  = 2, and the number of generators of su(nf )/o(nf ) for
 = 4.
ii) next we consider the case that both mv  m0 and ms  m0. in this case the diagonal
propagator is given by

g()

vv =

v) in lattice qcd with staggered fermions the lagrangian does not possess the axial
u(1) symmetry at nite lattice spacing (although it should be recovered in the continuum
limit). a detailed discussion of quenched lattice simulations for the valence quark mass
dependence of the chiral condensate in this case was given in [67]. the eective partition
function is then given by (53) with an eective lagrangian without singlet terms. the
diagonal propagator is thus given by

for  = 2 the coecient of the chiral logarithm vanishes and higher order corrections

9. spectral density in the ergodic and diusive domains

20

in the ergodic regime, for valence quark masses mv  f 2/0l2 the microscopic
spectral density is given by chrmt [7], whereas for qcd  mv  min  1/l40 the
one-loop calculation of (mv) is valid. in this section we calculate the spectral densities
in each of these domains. we rst show that in the ergodic domain the one-loop result
for (mv) coincides with the chrmt result.

the qcd partition function for two colors and fundamental fermions belongs to the
chgoe ( = 1) universality class [16]. in a sector of topological charge || and in the
chiral limit, the result reads [69, 70]:

chgoe

(96)

the qcd dirac operator with adjoint fermions belongs to the chgse ( = 4) univer-

sality class. in this case the microscopic spectral density is given by [71, 70]

(97)

for completeness we also give the microscopic spectral density for the chgue ( =
2) [72, 41] which describes the dirac operator of qcd with three or more colors and
fundamental fermions,

(u) =

(98)

the valence quark mass dependence of the chiral condensate in terms of the micro-

scopic variable x = mvv 0 is obtained via the relation

(x)

0

du

2x

u2 + x2 s(u) + ||

(99)

where the last term is the contribution from the exactly zero eigenvalues of the dirac
operator [22]. in the case of the chgue this integral can be perform analytically resulting
in

(100)

the asymptotic result for x  1 for the chgoe and the chgse can be easily derived using
this result and the asymptotic result of the remaining terms. the leading 1/x correction

21

can be obtained by expanding before integration. the only additional integral that is
required is

z

j(x) = 1.

the asymptotic result in terms of the dyson index is given by

v(x)

(101)

(102)

which coincides with the result (91) obtained from chiral perturbation theory. notice,
that the leading order asymptotic correction is independent of . this is no longer true
for higher order corrections and a summation over all  is required to compare with results
obtained for xed value of  (which is zero in our case) [73].

in the diusive domain, for 1/l2qcd  mv  qcd the valence quark mass de-
pendence of the chiral condensate is given by the one-loop result (88). the spectral
density is given by the discontinuity of (mv) across the imaginary axis (h()i/v =
disc|mv=i (mv)/2) [5, 6]. as nal result we then nd for the spectral density of the

10. conclusions

we have shown that the infrared limit of the qcd dirac spectrum is completely
determined by the pattern of chiral symmetry breaking. the spectral density follows
from the low energy eective partition function of the partially quenched qcd partition
function which in addition to the usual quarks contains valence quarks and their bosonic
superpartners. in this paper we have analyzed the case of two colors with fundamental
fermions and the case of fermions in the adjoint representation. in both cases the eective
lagrangian is based on a riemannian super-manifold originating from chiral symmetry
breaking to an ortho-symplectic graded lie group. as is the case for qcd with three
or more colors with fundamental fermions the goldstone manifold is characterized by a
symbiosis of compact and noncompact degrees of freedom.

our one-loop calculation of the valence quark mass dependence of the chiral condensate
for these two chiral symmetry breaking patterns completes an earlier calculation for qcd
with three colors and fundamental fermions [5]. its discontinuity results in an explicit
in all
expression for the spectral density of the dirac operator valid for   qcd.
three cases we can distinguish two dierent domains in the dirac spectrum which are
separated by the thouless energy. for valence quark masses below the thouless energy
the kinetic term decouples from the eective lagrangian and the the one-loop result for
the valence quark mass dependence of the chiral condensate is in complete agreement
with chiral random matrix theory. agreement with chiral random matrix theory to
all orders has only been shown for  = 2 by the means of an exact calculation of the
superintegrals. it would be interesting to perform this calculation for the mathematically
much more complicated cases of  = 1 and  = 4 as well. for valence quark masses beyond
the thouless energy the kinetic term has to be taken into account. the results for the
spectral density in this domain are consistent with the results for the scalar susceptibility
obtained with standard chpt. in particular we have obtained an analytical expression for
the slope of the dirac spectrum. remarkably, the slope vanishes for two massless avors
in all three cases.
