abstract

using the properties of gauged n = 4 supergravity, we show that it is
possible to derive a universal thermal eective potential that describes all
possible high-temperature instabilities of the known n = 4 superstrings.
these instabilities are due to non-perturbative dyonic modes, which become
tachyonic in a region of the thermal moduli space m = {s, t, u}; m is
common to all non-perturbative dual-equivalent n = 4 superstrings in ve
dimensions. we analyse the non-perturbative thermal potential and show
the existence of a phase transition at high temperatures corresponding to
a condensation of 5-branes. this phase is described in detail, using an
eective non-critical string theory.

1 introduction

at nite temperatures the partition function z() and the mean energy u() develop
power pole singularities in   t 1 if the density of states of a system grows exponen-
tially with the energy:

(e)  ek ebe ,
z() = z de (e) ee 
u() = 
ln z  (k  1)

(1.1)

at the critical temperature, th = b1, various thermodynamical quantities diverge

[1]. an alternative interpretation of the pole singularity in u() follows from the

identication of the temperature with the inverse radius of a compactied euclidean
time on s1: 2t = 1/r. in this representation, the partition function is given by the
(super-)trace over the thermal spectrum of the theory in (d  1) dimensions:

ln z() = str lnm().

(1.2)

the pole singularity is then a manifestation of a thermal state becomes massless at the
hagedorn temperature th . thus, the knowledge of the thermal spectrum m() as a
function of the s1 radius r = /2, determines th [2].

perturbative string theories provide examples of an exponentially growing density
of states, with k = d, the dimension of space-time, and b1  o()1/2 [6][8].
in superstrings the states that become tachyonic at th have necessarily a non-zero

winding number n [3, 4, 5].

from the perturbative study of the n = 4 strings we can see that the states that

become tachyonic above th correspond to the n = 4 bps states that preserve half of

the supersymmetries (n = 2) [9]. however, in the n = 4 theories the the masses of the

non-perturbative bps states are known as well thanks to the n = 4 supersymmetry

algebra with central extension [10][12]. we can therefore identify all perturbative

and non-perturbative bps states that are able to induce high-t instabilities using the

string duality properties among the heterotictype iiatype iibtype i strings with

n = 4 supersymmetry [13][16].

in this talk i will summarize the results of ref.

[9] concerning non-perturbative

n = 4 theories at nite temperatures.

2 thermally modied n = 4 bps masses

in order to obtain the thermal partition function one modies the boundary condi-
tions around the s1-euclidean time by a spin-statistical phase. in perturbative string
theories the consequence of this phase is to shift the kaluzaklein momenta of the s1

(2.3)

and reverse the gso projection in the n-odd winding sector; q = ql + qr is the

helicity operator while  = 1 in the heterotic string and  = 0 in type ii strings

[3, 4, 5, 9].

the left- (and right- ) supersymmetric gso projection(s) implies that in the even
winding sector all states have m 2  0. however, some of the states with odd winding
number can become tachyonic by a reversion of the gso-projection [3, 4, 5, 9]. the
only states that can become tachyonic have n = 1 and left-helicity ql = 1 (right-
helicity = qr for type ii). they are scalars in (d  1)-dimensions (the longitudinal
components of the d-dimensional gravitons). the hagedorn temperature corresponds
to the critical value of the s1 radius at which the rst tachyonic state appears when
2r = t 1 decreases.

the appearance of tachyons can never arise in any perturbative supersymmetric

eld theory, since it behaves like the zero-winding sector of strings. in non-perturbative

supersymmetric eld theories, however, such an instability can arise due to thermal

dyonic modes, which behave like the odd winding string states.

indeed, before the

temperature modication, the heterotictype ii duality in ve dimensions exchanges

the winding number n with the magnetic charge :

where m and n are the s1 momentum and winding numbers, and  is the non-
perturbative wrapping number for the heterotic 5-brane around t 4  s1; h is the
string coupling in d = 6; the tension of the 5-brane t5=1/2

s-duality relations:

(2.6)

the momentum and winding numbers are now m and ; n is the wrapping number for
the type iia ns 5-brane around k3  s1. from the six-dimensional viewpoint, m/r
is the kaluzaklein momentum, while the last two terms correspond to bps strings

with tension

(2.7)

where p, q are relatively prime integers, (n, l) = k (p, q). the common divisor k denes
the wrapping of the tp,q string around s1; q is the charge of the fundamental string

and p the magnetic charge of the solitonic string obtained by wrapping the ns 5-brane

around k3. the tp,q-strings cannot become tensionless since thet never are associated

to vanishing cycles of the internal manifold.

the ve-dimensional thermal mass formula is obtained by the non-perturbative

generalization of the temperature deformation using the (p, q)-string picture of the
non-perturbative bps spectrum by replacing m  m + q + n
2 and reversing the gso-
projection in the k-odd sector of the (p, q)-strings (q is the helicity operator of the

5d-thermal theory):

t =   m + q + kp

(2.8)

this thermal formula reproduces the perturbative result for both heterotic and type iia
theories. in the heterotic perturbative limit h  0, only the  = 0 = q states survive,
while in the type iia perturbative limit ii  0, only the n = 0 = p states survive.
note that in the general case of a tp,q string with the temperature deformation, the
condition mk  0 becomes mk  1, because of the inversion of the gso-projection.
from eq. (2.8), it follows that if the heterotic coupling h is smaller than the

critical value

h < c

h =

(2.9)

hagedorn temperature. on the other hand, if the heterotic theory is strongly coupled,

the rst tachyon appears at r = (2 + 1)q
h, the rst tachyon appears at r = q2

h h = 2q

ii/2; this corresponds to

3

the type iia hagedorn temperature. besides the above two would-be tachyons, the

mass formula (2.8) leads in general to two series of potentially tachyonic states with
m = 1. however the critical temperature (2r)1 for each of the states in both series
is always higher than the lowest hagedorn heterotic temperature while, as discussed

above, the type iia hagedorn temperature rst appears when the heterotic coupling
exceeds the critical value c

h (2.9).

in order to include the type iib dual n = 4 string, we need to discuss ve-

dimensional theories at nite temperature, taking into account the compactication

radius r6 from six to ve dimensions. type iia and iib strings are then related by

the inversion of r6. the extension to four dimensions of the mass formula (2.8) is

straightforward. it depends on three parameters, the string coupling gh, the temper-

ature radii r and r6. it is convenient to introduce the three combinations

iia = 22t,

(2.13)

the temperature radius r is by construction identical in all three string theories. note

that l = kq corresponds to the wrapping number of the heterotic 5-brane around
r as in ve dimensions, while l = kr corresponds to the same wrapping number
t 4  s1
after performing a t -duality along the s1
r6 direction, which is orthogonal to the 5-
brane. all winding numbers, n, l, l, correspond to magnetic charged states from the

eld theory point of view. their masses are proportional to the temperature-radius

r and are not thermally shifted; p, q, r are all non-negative relatively prime integers.
this follows from the bps conditions and the s  t  u duality symmetry in the

4

undeformed supersymmetric theory. futhermore, mk  1 because of the inversion of
the gso projection in the temperature-deformed theory. using these constraints, one
can show that there are, in general, two potential tachyonic series with m = 1 and
p = 1, 2 [9] generalizing the ve-dimensional result. one of the perturbative heterotic,

type iia, or type iib potential tachyons corresponds to a critical temperature that is

always lower than those of the two series with p = 1, 2.

the above discussion shows that the temperature modication of the mass formula

inferred from perturbative strings and applied to the non-perturbative bps mass for-

mula produces the appropriate instabilities in terms of the hagedorn temperatures. in

ref. [9] we show that it is possible to go beyond the simple enumeration of hagedorn

temperatures and construct the full temperature-dependent eective potential associ-

ated with the would-be tachyonic states. this will allow a study of the nature of the

non-perturbative instabilities and the dynamics of the various thermal phases.

3 thermal eective potential

our procedure to construct the thermal eective theory is as follows: we consider

ve-dimensional n = 4 theories at nite temperature. they can then eectively be de-

scribed by four-dimensional theories, in which supersymmetry is spontaneously broken

by thermal eects. since we want to limit ourselves to the description of instabilities,

it is sucient to retain, in the full n = 4 spectrum, only the potentially massless

and tachyonic states. this restriction will lead us to consider only spin 0 and 1/2

states, the graviton and one of the gravitinos. this sub-spectrum is described by an

n = 1 supergravity with six chiral multiplets: the three moduli s, t, u, and the three

would-be tachyonic states za, a = 1, 2, 3. using the properties of the n = 4 (gauged)

supergravities in four dimensions [17][19],[5], it is possible to derive the temperature

motication associated to the scherk-schwarz temperature gauging [21, 22, 5, 4]. this

is done in ref.

[9], where the kahler manifold k and the superpotential w of the

eective n = 1 supergravity [23] are derived:

k =  log(s + s)  log(t + t )  log(u + u )  2 log(1  2|za|2 + |z 2

the resulting scalar potential has a complicated expression. important simplications

occur, however, when we restrict ourselves to the would-be tachyonic states, za = re za

and in s = re s, t = re t , u = re u. following the analysis of ref.

[9] only these

directions are relevant to the vacuum structure of the potential and to possible phase

transitions. the resulting scalar potential v is:

having the full eective thermal potential of the theory we able to study the phase

structure of the thermal eective theory. there are four dierent phases corresponding

to specic regions of the s, t and u moduli space. their boundaries are dened by

critical values of the moduli s, t, and u (or of i, i = 1, 2, 3), or equivalently by critical

values of the temperature, the (four-dimensional) string coupling and the compacti-

cation radius r6. these four phases are [9]:

1. the low-temperature phase:

t < (2  1)1/2/(4) .

2. the high-temperature heterotic phase:

t > (2  1)1/2/(4) and g2

h < (2 + 2)/4 .

 the low-temperature phase, which is common to all three strings, is characterized

h .

by

h1 = h2 = h3 = 0,

v1 = v2 = v3 = 0.

(3.18)

the potential vanishes for all values of the moduli s, t and u, which are then only

restricted by the stability of the phase, namely the absence of tachyons in the mass

spectrum of the scalars ha. since the (four-dimensional) string couplings are

s = 2g2
h ,

t = 2g2
a ,

u = 2g2
b ,

this phase exists in the perturbative regime of all three strings. the relevant light

thermal states are just the massless modes of the ve-dimensional n = 4 supergravity,
with thermal mass scaling like 1/r  t .

 the high-temperature heterotic phase is dened by

h > 1 >

(3.19)
with h = (2 + 1)2. the inequalities on 2 and 3 eliminate type ii instabilities. in
this region of the moduli, the potential becomes, after minimization with respect to

(3.20)

the transition from the low-temperature vacuum is due to a condensation of the het-

erotic thermal winding mode h1 or, equivalently, to a condensation of type iia ns

5-brane in the type iia picture. at the level of the potential only, this phase exhibits

a runaway behaviour in s. we will show in the next section that a stable solution to

the eective action exists with non-trivial metric and/or dilaton.

 the high-temperature type iia and iib phases are dened by the inequalities

(3.23)

in contrast with the high-temperature heterotic phase, the potential does not possess

stationary values of 2 and/or 3, besides the critical points 2,3 = 4. suppose for

instance that 2 < 4 and 3 > 4. the resulting potential is then v2 only and 2 slides to
zero. in this limit, v =  1/(stu4), and the dynamics of    log(stu) is described
by the eective lagrangian

the other scalar components log(t/u) and log(s/u) have only derivative couplings

since the potential only depends on . they can be taken as constant and arbitrary.
the dynamics only restricts the temperature radius 2r2 = e, r6 and the string
coupling is not constrained. the ground state of this phase corresponds to a non-trivial
gravitational and dilaton background satisfying the einstein and  equations of lii
e.
this background solution denes the high-temperature type ii vacuum. we will not

study this solution further. instead, we will examine in more detail the high-t heterotic

phase.

4 the high-t heterotic phase transition

using the information contained in the eective theory, which is characterized by eqs.

(3.20), the equations of motion of all scalar elds are satised, with the exception of

the dilaton s = re s. the resulting bosonic eective lagrangian that describes the

dynamics of s and g is:

lh
bos =

(4.24)

8

for all (xed) values of s, the cosmological constant is negative, since v = (24s)1
and the apparent geometry is anti-de sitter. but the eective theory (4.24) does not
stabilize s. rewriting lh

bos in the heterotic string frame,

we obtain

it is easy to show that the -equation of motion is that of a 2d-sigma-model -function

(4.27)

with

(4.28)

in this background there is a shift for all boson masses, m 2

3/2
because of the non-trivial dilaton. the fermionic masses are also shifted because of the

b  m 2

b + q2 = m 2

b + m2

temperature. as a result, the perturbative heterotic mass spectrum shows, fermion

boson mass degenerany due to a residual supersymmetry existing in this background

[5, 9]. at the non-perturbative level, however, this degeneracy is lost in the non-

perturbative massive sector of the theory, although the ground state remains super-

symmetric [9]. thus, the high-t phase is expected to be stable in the weak coupling

heterotic regime, because of the n = 2 residual supersymmetry. the reader can nd

more details at this point in ref. [9].

5 the high-t non-critical string

as we discussed above, the high-t phase of n = 4 strings is described by a non-critical
string with central charge decit c = 4, provided the (six-dimensional) heterotic
string is in the weakly coupled regime, h  (2 + 1)/2. one possible description is

in terms of the (5+1) super-liouville theory compactied (at least) on s1

r, with radius
h/2. the perturbative stability of this ground

xed at the fermionic point r = q

9

state is guaranteed when there is at least nsc = 2 superconformal symmetry on the
world-sheet, implying at least n = 1 supersymmetry in space-time.

an explicit example with nsc = 4 superconformal was given in refs. [26, 27, 9]. it is
obtained when, together with the temperature s1
r, there is an additional compactied
coordinate on s1
h/2. these two
circles are equivalent to a compactication on [su(2)  su(2)]k at the limiting value
of level k = 0. indeed, at k = 0, only the six world-sheet fermionic coordinates survive

r6, with radius xed at the fermionic point r6 = q

describing a c = 2 system (with an so(4)k=1 current algebra) instead of c = 6 of
k  , consistently with the decoupling of four supercoordinates, c = 4. the
central-charge decit is compensated by the linear motion of the dilaton associated to
the liouville eld,  = qx with q2 = 1/(2

h), so that cl = 8q2

h = 4.

using the techniques developed in ref. [28, 27], we derive in refs. [9] the one-loop

(perturbative) partition function in the high-t heterotic phase. here i stress some of

our results. more details will appear in ref. [9].

 the initial n = 4 supersymmetry is reduced in the high-t heterotic phase to n =
2. this agrees with the eective eld theory analysis of the high-t phase. the

(perturbative) bosonic and fermionic mass uctuations are degenerate because
of the remaining n = 2 supersymmetry (nsc = 4 superconformal on the world-
sheet).

 the spectrum of the theory contains two sectors, h = 0 and h = 1: the h = 0
sector has no massless uctuations; the bosonic and fermionic masses (squared)
are shifted by m2

3/2 because of the dilaton background and the temperature cou-
pling; all masses are larger than or equal to m3/2. this is again in agreement

with the eective theory analysis.

 in the h = 1 sector there are massless excitations, as expected from the (5+1)

super-liouville theory [29, 27].

 the 5 + 1 liouville background can be regarded as an euclidean 5-brane solution
wrapped on s1  s1 preserving one-half (n = 2) of the initial n = 4 space-time
supersymmetries.

 the massless space-time fermions coming from the h = 1 sector are six-dimensional
space-time spinors; they are also spinors under the so(4)k=2 right-moving group

10

dened at the fermionic point of the s1

r6 compactication; they are also in

r  s1

the vector representation of an so(28)k=1 heterotic right-moving group.

 the massless space-time bosons are in the same right-moving representation, e.g.
spinors under so(4)k=1 and vectors under so(28)k=1 right-moving groups. in

addition, they are spinors under so(4)k=1 left-moving group. together with the

massless fermions, they form 28 n = 2 hypermultiplets sitting on the special

quaternionic space:

h =

so(4, 28)

so(4)  so(28)

.

the 28 massless hypermultiplets in the h = 1 sector are the only states that survive

in the zero-slope limit. their eective eld theory is described by an n = 2 4d-sigma-
model on a hyper-kahler manifold k, which is obtained from h in the decoupling limit
of gravity. this topological theory corresponds to the innite temperature limit of the

n = 4 strings after the heterotic hagedorn phase transition [9].

although the 5 + 1 liouville background is perturbatively stable, owing to the
nsc = 4 superconformal symmetry, its stability is not ensured at the non-perturbative
level when the heterotic coupling is large:

2 + 1
22  0.8536 .

in ref. [9], various candidate backgrounds with c = 4 are considered. the rst one
is that of (5 + 1) super-liouville (cl = 4) already examined above. another class of

the indices a and v stand for the axial and vector wzw u(1) gaugings. then,

many backgrounds can be obtained by marginal deformations of the above, which
preserve at least nsc = 2, or also by performing s- or t -duality transformations on
them.

as already explained, the appropriate background must verify the weak-coupling

p(axial). indeed, in this background, g2

constraint (5.29). this weak-coupling limitation is achieved in the axial parafermionic
space m4
h(x) is bounded in the entire non-
compact four-dimensional space, with coordinates x = {z, z, w, w}, provided the
initial value of g2

h(x = 0) is small:

vanish for asymptotically large values of |z| and |w| (asymptotically at space). this
space has maximal curvature when |z| = |w| = 0. this solution has a behaviour similar
to the one of the liouville solution in the asymptotic regime |z|, |w|  . in this
limit, the dilaton  becomes linear when expressed in terms of the at coordinates xi:

 =  re[logz]  re[logw] = q1|x1|  q2|x2|,

x1 = re[logz],

x2 = re[logw],

x3 = im[logz],

x4 = im[logw].

(5.33)

in the large- |z| and |w| limit, m4
p is at with ds2 = 4(dxi)2. the important point here
is that for large values of |x1| and |x2|,   0, in contrast to the liouville background
in which  = q1x1 +q2x2 and therefore the dilaton is becoming positive and arbitrarily
large in one half of the space, thus violating the weak-coupling constraint (5.29).
we then conclude that the high-t heterotic phase is well described by the m4

this space is n = 2 supersymmetric and stable when g2

on the heterotic or type iia side, the high-temperature limit after the high-t

heterotic phase transition corresponds to a topological n = 2 supersymmetric theory

described by a 4d-sigma-model on a non-trivial hyper-kahler manifold. on the type

iib side, on the other hand, the high-t phase corresponds to a tensionless string
dened by a limit that generalizes the large-n limit of yangmills theory, 
h  ,
h  0, with 
hh xed [9]. it is very interesting to study further the properties
of these theories that describe the high-t phase of string theory, in more general

compactications with lower number of supersymmetries, and to study their possible

cosmological implications.
