abstract

a d3-brane probe in the context of ads/cft correspondence at nite tem-
perature is considered. the supergravity predictions for the physical eective
couplings of the world-volume gauge theory of the probe brane are compared to
those calculated in one-loop perturbation theory in the thermal gauge theory. it
is argued that when the higgs expectation value is much larger than the temper-
ature, the supergravity result must agree with perturbative thermal yang-mills.
this provides a perturbative test of the maldacena conjecture. predictions for the
running electric and magnetic eective couplings, beyond perturbation theory are
also obtained. phenomenological applications for universe-branes are discussed.
in particular mechanisms are suggested for reducing the induced cosmological
constant and naturally obtaining a varying speed of light and a consequent in-
ation on the universe brane.

1 introduction

the central elements of cft/anti-de sitter (ads) correspondence [1, 2, 3] are the black
d-brane solutions of type ii supergravity [4] and their near-horizon geometry [5] along with
their microscopic interpretation [6]. in particular, the (3+1)-dimensional world-volume of
n coinciding, extremal d3-branes is the arena of n =4 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills
(sym) theory which in the large n limit, according to the maldacena conjecture [1], is dual
to type iib superstrings propagating on the near-horizon ads5  s5 background geometry.
there is a further proposal [7] linking the thermodynamics of large n, n =4 supersymmetric
su(n) yang-mills theory with the thermodynamics of schwarzschild black holes embedded
in the ads space [8]. the classical geometry of black holes with hawking temperature t
encodes the magnetic connement, mass gap and other qualitative features of large n gauge
theory heated up to the same temperature. at the computational level, the quantity that
has been discussed to the largest extent [9, 7, 10]-[13] is the bekenstein-hawking entropy
which, in the maldacena limit, should be related to the entropy of yang-mills gas at n  
and large t hooft coupling g2

ymn.

turning-on higgs expectation values in the gauge theory corresponds in the brane picture
to moving around the d3-branes. a useful conguration is one in which one (or a few) d-
branes are put a distance r away from the stack of n d-branes (while being kept parallel).
in gauge theory this amounts to turning on a higgs expectation value r/ breaking the
gauge symmetry su(n + 1)  su(n)  u(1).

in the limit of n   and large t hooft coupling , the d-brane stack is well described
by supergravity with a specic background eld conguration. thus, the world-volume
action of the probe brane can be evaluated from the knowledge of the coupling of the world-
volume gauge theory to the bulk supergravity elds (see for example [14]). on the other hand
at small  the eective action of the probe brane can be computed in yang-mills perturbation
theory. at extremality (zero temperature in the gauge theory) n = 4 supersymmetry is
known to prohibit renormalization of the two-derivative eective action and this is also
visible in the supergravity prediction. there are renormalizations to the four-derivative
eective action and the leading supergravity term is expected to be given by the one-loop
gauge theory result [15, 16].

supersymmetry can be broken softly by putting the gauge theory in a heat bath with
temperature t . this is expected to be described in supergravity by the near horizon limit of
a black d-brane, namely an ads black-hole whose hawking temperature is t [7]. moreover,
a probe brane sitting outside of the horizon at a distance r is described by the u(1) part of
thermal n = 4 sym su(n + 1)  su(n)  u(1). several phenomena as well as the fate
of the original scale duality can be still studied in this context [17]-[21].

here we will study the eective gauge theory action on the probe d3-brane at nite
temperature. at strong t hooft coupling , it will be obtained from supergravity. the
relevant data are the classical black-brane solution as well as the world-volume d-brane
action. the relevant scales appearing in the theory are the higgs expectation value u and
the temperature t (or rather the thermal wavelength  t . from the supergravity point
of view,  t  u. at  t = u corresponds the black-brane horizon. thus, from

supergravity we can calculate the eective potential, the kinetic terms as well as higher

1

derivative terms (for example f 4 terms). this eective action is supposed to be valid as
n   and  large.

in perturbation theory the relevant diagrams are open string diagrams with a number
of boundaries attached to the stack of n d3-branes and a single boundary stack on the
probe brane [22]. their   0 limit provides the appropriate gauge theory diagrams. they
integrate out the su(n) and massive degrees of freedom.
we argue here, that in the supersymmetry restoration limit  t << u the supergravity
result has a natural expansion in powers of , and can be compared with perturbative
yang-mills calculations. a similar situation occurs in near extremal calculations of black-
hole gray-body factors [23]. the key ingredient for such behavior is supersymmetric non-
renormalization theorems valid in the limit where supersymmetry is restored [24].

supergravity predicts that the leading contribution to the eective potential comes from
three-loops and is proportional to t 8/u4. as a rst test we do the one-loop computation
of the vacuum energy by integrating-out the massive open strings, and we nally take the

  0 limit. in the relevant supersymmetric limit  t << u the one-loop contribution is
exponentially suppressed as eu/t . this contribution can be thought-of a non-perturbative
contribution due to a solitonic string (see also [25]). for this to be true we must have the
following hierarchy:  << t /u << 1. thus, up to exponentially suppressed contributions
the one-loop calculation gives zero for the potential in the limit t /u << 1 in accordance
with supergravity. the exponentially suppressed contributions will be absent if we treat the
fundamental multiplet with mass  u (corresponding to the open string stretched between
black and probe brane) to be non-thermal. we can thus formulate the following:

 conjecture: consider n = 4 superym su(n + m)  su(n) su(m) u(1) by a
higgs expectation value u, t hooft coupling  and n >> m. consider also that the su(n)
part is in a heat bath with temperature t. for  t << u the o(n) part of the vacuum
energy has a leading behavior  2t 8/u4 and is given by supergravity. the o(n) part of
the vacuum energy can be considered as the vacuum energy induced on the probe brane due
to quantum eects on the other brane or the bulk.

a similar investigation of the kinetic terms for scalars and gauge bosons gives a super-
gravity derived result which starts at two loops in the limit t /u << 1. a one-loop calcu-
lation gives an exponentially suppressed result (or zero for non-thermal fundamental) , in
accordance with the supergravity calculation. finally, supergravity predicts a one-loop (and
higher) contribution to the f 4 couplings of the probe brane. the one-loop open-string/gauge
theory calculation is performed and gives agreement with supergravity as expected.

there are two phenomena observed here that may be potentially important for phe-

nomenological purposes.

 suppression of vacuum energy on a brane.

it is popular lately to consider our four
dimensional universe as a three-brane, embedded in ten dimensional, (partially) compactied
spacetime. moreover, other three-branes may be providing mirror universes. the prototype
of this is the horava-witten interpretation of the heterotic string [26]. one of the important
eects in this context is supersymmetry breaking in a mirror brane and its communication in
our universe. here we have a toy model of this situation. in the presence of supersymmetry,
the spectator brane is the black-brane while our universe is represented by the probe brane.

2

both three-branes carry n = 4 supersymmetry. there is only one dynamical scale in the
problem: the distance or higgs expectation value, mdy n  u. spontaneous supersymmetry
breaking on the spectator branes is modeled by considering a thermal state (with temperature
t). the supersymmetry breaking scale is msu sy  t . standard supertrace formulae imply
that when n = 4 supersymmetry is broken the vacuum energy scales as m 4
su sy . here we
nd that the cosmological constant induced in our universe due to supersymmetry breaking
2. moreover, it is
on the spectator brane is much smaller:
expected that the extra contributions to the vacuum energy on the universe brane due to
loops of brane elds will have extra suppression factors of the coupling constant. there is
also a hint that this supression of the vacuum energy would persist for the case of n = 2
world-volume supersymmetry.

 induction of eld-dependent or time-varying speed of light on a brane. when a probe
brane moves in the gravitational eld of another black brane, the induced eld theory on
the probe brane although lorentz invariant, has a eld dependent velocity of light. in the
gauge theory picture this eective velocity of light is due to thermal quantum eects. in the
simple example we analyze here this velocity of light dependents on the distance (which is
also a dynamical scalar eld of the probe brane) to the black-brane. in the case discussed
in this paper, the probe brane is outside the horizon of the black brane. there may be
situations where the eective velocity of light is time dependent and that can be achieved by
taking the brane inside the horizon and performing the appropriate analytic continuation. a
time-varying speed of light can be an alternative to ination and can thus provide dierent
way to solve the atness problem in cosmology, [27].

the structure of this paper is as follows; in section two we describe the basic black-brane
solutions we will be using here as well as we evaluate the wold-volume probe action in such
backgrounds. in section three we focus on three-branes, we take the near-horizon limit and
gravitationally derive the thermal yang-mills potential. in section four, we perform the one-
loop computation of the potential in open string theory and by taking the -limit in thermal
gauge-theory. this agrees with the gravitational calculation up to exponentially suppressed
terms. in section ve we do a similar analysis for two and four derivative eective couplings
on the probe brane. finally in section six we discuss potential phenomenological applications
of the phenomena discussed here. in the appendix a careful evaluation of the rr gauge eld
in black-brane congurations is given.

the leading long-distance term can be understood as follows:

it is due to the classical
interaction of the extremal probe with the non-extremal collection of p-branes. this inter-
action is proportional [14] to qprobe(mp  nvptp). an important point here is that the mass

3 d3-branes, the near-horizon limit and the thermal

yang-mills potential

the case of d3-branes is particularly interesting because the world-volume action of n coin-
ciding d-branes involves a four-dimensional n =4 supersymmetric su(n) yang-mills theory.
moreover, in this case there is a natural correspondence (at all scales) with supergravity:
according to the maldacena conjecture [1], the large n limit of this gauge theory is related to
the near-horizon ads geometry of the extremal (r0 = 0) black d3-brane solution (2.1). wit-
ten [7] has exploited the ads/sym correspondence in order to study the large n dynamics
of non-supersymmetric sym, with n =4 supersymmetries broken by non-zero temperature
eects. according to this proposal, the non-extremal solution (2.1) may be used to study
sym at t identied with the hawking temperature (2.11) as long as t  1/l, so that the
metric remains near-extremal (r0  l). in the near-horizon limit,   l2
s  0 at u  r/
and t xed, the solution (2.1) describes an ads-schwarzschild black hole [8]:

a d3-brane probe in the bulk of the ads space corresponding to n background d3-branes
can be thought of as a realization of su(n +1) gauge theory in the su(n)u(1) symmetric
higgs phase. in the following, we will examine the potential induced on the probe brane in
the near-horizon limit and we will eventually compare it with the gauge theory calculation.

to that end, we will use the following expansions in the string length scale ls:

the potential in (3.7) according to the maldacena conjecture has a direct interpretation
in the context of su(n+1) n=4 gauge theory at nite temperature. we consider su(n+1)
n=4 gauge theory and a higgs expectation value u that breaks the gauge symmetry to
su(n)  u(1). at nite temperature, supersymmetry is broken. we consider now the
quantum eective action for the u(1) factor, obtained by integrating out all su(n) as well
as massive degrees of freedom. this has an expansion in powers of 1/n. the leading piece
is o(n). at large t hooft coupling  this should be given by supergravity as in (3.7). we
will rewrite it in terms of gauge theory variables as

this form should be compared with gauge theory for large higgs expectation value u >> t .
for u close to the horizon, there is a non-trivial map between the supergravity and the
gauge theory variable [22]. this is obtained by matching the form of the world-volume
kinetic terms between supergravity and gauge theory. the d-brane coordinate  is related
to the supergravity coordinate u as

as mentioned before the potential in (3.8) is supposed to be valid in the limit of large t
hooft coupling. we can, however, consider the limit in which the higgs expectation is much
larger than the thermal wavelength, u >> t . in this limit, supersymmetry is broken
very softly. expanding the supergravity generated potential we obtain

we observe that the large u expansion is equivalent here to an expansion in the t hooft
coupling. the leading term m = 1 is a three-loop term. this is suggestive that although the
result is strictly speaking valid for strong t hooft coupling, it might still be reliable also in
perturbation theory.

this situation is reminiscent of an analogous phenomenon in the near-extremal calcula-
tions of grey-body factors in d-brane black-holes [23]. there also, a result that is valid at
strong t hooft coupling agrees with yang-mills perturbation theory. the reason was traced
at specic non-renormalization theorems due to softly broken supersymmetry, [24]. a similar
phenomenon is occurring here. for this to work, contributions that are higher order in 
should be suppressed by extra powers of t 2/u2. the next order term in the bulk action is
of order 3. to calculate its contribution to the potential we need the  corrected form of
the four-form away from the near-horizon limit. such an investigation is under way and will
provide further evidence for the above.

1 this is in agreement with [12]. the potential here diers however in the large u limit.

the diagrams relevant here, that are leading in n, at higher orders in the t hooft
coupling have one boundary stuck at the probe brane and the rest are attached to the stack
of n d3-branes. thus, they scale as n(gsn)b2  nb2 where b is the total number of
boundaries. moreover, the supergravity result implies that only diagrams with b = 2m + 2,
m > 0 contribute. in the gauge theory this implies that contributing diagrams appear at
order m + 1, starting at three loops. written in the double line notation of t hooft they
have 2m + 1 index loops with n circulating colors and one with one color. thus, they can
be represented as a disk with 2m + 1 holes. cutting the diagrams appropriately we can see
that su(n) degrees of freedom circulate in intermediate channels. these are responsible for
producing the temperature dependent factors and in particular the power-like behaviour of
the potential.

in analogy with grey-body factor calculations we can conjecture that the potential (3.8)
can be compared with perturbative thermal yang-mills calculations. in particular this im-
plies that there are no one-loop and two-loop contributions, and the rst non-trivial term is
coming in at three-loops. the leading contribution is  2 t 8/u4.

in the next section we will do the one-loop computation and show that in the large u limit
it is exponentially suppressed. these exponential contributions are non-perturbative from
our point of view and can be interpreted as due to solitonic loops. thus, up to such terms,
the gauge theory will give a zero contribution at one loop. moreover, there is independent
evidence that the next term comes from three loops and behaves like t 8/u4.
in [28] the
theory analyzed is su(2) n = 2 super ym and the relevant contribution was found from a
two-loop diagram with an eective one-loop generated vertex. this amounts to a three-loop
contribution in the original su(2) theory.

there is an alternative way to implement the perturbative calculation: consider a ther-
mal ensemble in the su(n) part but treat the massive degrees of freedom as though they
were not thermal. then the one loop calculation in the gauge theory will give zero both for
the potential and the kinetic terms. this will be shown explicitly in the next section. the
dierence with the previous calculation is that there will be no exponentially suppressed
terms here.

the above can produce a stringent test of the maldacena conjecture that can be performed
in yang-mills perturbation theory. one needs to evaluate the eective potential of the
u(1) scalar in su(n + 1)  su(n)  u(1) theory at two and three loops. the relevant
o(n 2) two-loop diagram is shown in g. 1 (we use the notation of g. 2). this sumarises
contributions of scalars, fermions and ghosts. note that there is no relevant double-bubble

diagram. according to our conjecture this should give only exponentially small contributions
at large u, (or zero i the massive fundamental is not thermalized). the diagram includes
two massive external propagators as well as a massless internal one. this can be written as
a one-loop diagram of the su(n) degrees of freedom where instead of the tree propagator
we use the one-loop corrected propagator where only massive states go around the loop (g.
1). however, the results of the next section imply that such corrections to the propagators
after summed over the various states are exponentially suppressed. this is in accord with
our expectations that the two-loop contribution to the potential is exponentially suppressed.

the appropriate eld theory diagrams that contribute to three-loop order are shown
it would be extremely interesting to perform the eld theory calculation and

in g. 3.
reproduce the leading term in (3.11).

the conjecture above is also valid in the case where su(n + m)  su(n)  su(m) 
u(1) with n >> m. the probe action must be replaced by the appropriate non-abelian
generalization [29] and the potential is m 2 times the one calculated in the u(1) case.

4 perturbation theory and the potential

in this section we will study the static potential further and we will try to make contact
with gauge theory perturbation theory.

we will rst consider an open string theory evaluation of the static potential. this can be
done by integrating out in perturbation theory the stretched strings between n d3-branes
and a d3-probe at distance r. the one-loop free-energy at nite temperature is [30]

these are instanton contributions. the instanton is the world-sheet of an open string
stretched a distance r and wound around the temporal circle. this gives a conguration
with area r and action sinst  r/. the determinant factor is in fact the determinant on
the above-mentioned cylinder with (real) modulus t  /r of the open string uctuations.
when t > 1 they are best described by open string states while when t < 1 they are best
described by closed string states.

since  > h   > 2, the only other corner in the ,r plane to investigate is r < 1.
in the small r region the massive modes of the string are subleading. the reason is that
as r  0 the mass gap vanishes for the massless states and it is those that dominate the
behavior of the free energy. the dominant contribution is [31, 12]

is indeed that of eld theory. the leading term is the change of the yang mills free energy

here the higgs expectation value is much smaller than the temperature. the theory is close
to unbroken yang mills as indicated by the free energy. supersymmetry is completely broken
and this is reected in the form of the free energy. the minimum of the potential is again at
u = 0. this is true for any temperature since the derivative of the potential with respect to u
is proportional to u times an integral of a non-negative integrand. the only other extremum
is at u =  but this is a maximum. thus, the potential is monotonically decreasing from
u =  to u = 0.

the form of the potential for large temperature (4.14) agrees qualitatively with the one
in this region we do not expect quantitative agreement, but
obtained by supergravity.
it is obvious that the one-loop contributions has similar features to the strong coupling
(supergravity) result.
in this limit the vacuum energy has a leading piece which is the
supersymmetry breaking scale (temperature) to the fourth power, as expected in a non-
supersymmetric theory.

the situation is dierent at large distances, or large higgs expectation values. the
one-loop results is exponentially suppressed, and one reason for this is approximate super-
symmetry in this limit. this can be clearly seen by our computation. separately bosons
and fermions produce a temperature-independent polynomial piece scaling as r4 at large r
plus exponentially small contributions. the polynomial piece cancels between fermions and
bosons and we are left with the exponentially small contribution. in general this is an ex-
pected feature of softly or spontaneously broken supersymmetry. a dierent way of viewing
this behavior is to state that the object (open string) going around the loop has a nite size
and thus gives an exponentially small contribution. from the point of view of supergravity
it behaves as a soliton, and it is not visible in the long distance expansion.

it is obvious from our calculation that if the massive open string (or in the   0 limit
the massive fundamental multiplet) is not thermal then the contribution to the potential
will be zero.

the potential (vacuum energy) is generically expected to scale as the larger mass in
the fourth power, namely r4. from supergravity we obtain the prediction that the leading
contribution is t 8/r4 which is strongly suppressed.

we conclude that the supergravity calculation provides us with the physical (non-wilsonian)

eective action of the u(1) gauge theory after integrating out the su(n) plus the massive

13

degrees of freedom. moreover, exponentially small contributions in perturbation theory are
not visible in the supergravity result. this suggest that the proper context is to take only
the su(n) part to be in a thermal bath. the quantum contributions of the world-volume
elds have not been taken into account. in the large n limit they turn out to be subleading.

5 kinetic and quartic terms

and near the horizon ~e  0. since ~e is the source for fundamental strings attached to the
brane, that implies that such couplings are suppressed close to the horizon. taking the near
horizon limit does not essentially modify the kinetic terms we have described above.

the eective kinetic terms can be examined at large u in the same way done for the
potential. the corrections are power series in (t r2/u)4 and they start at two loops. an
open string calculation similar to that for the potential can be done also for the kinetic terms
along the lines of [32, 30]. the result for the one-loop correction to the two-derivative terms

where we assumed in the second line u  1. thus, at one-loop the conclusion is that the
correction to the kinetic terms is exponentially suppressed for large u (as for the potential).
this is again a signal of softly broken supersymmetry. also, the insertion of the two vertex
operators in the diagram reduces the eective supersymmetry to n =2 so that already at two
loops there is a power correction. it is also obvious from our expression that if the massive
string is not thermal then the one-loop contribution to the kinetic terms vanishes.

if one continues to the f 4 couplings, then there is already a one-loop contribution in the
extremal limit, and it is corrected by a power series in (t r2/u)4 coming from higher loops.

which agrees with the leading order in the supergravity calculation. we can conclude that
all eects that vanish in the limit of exact supersymmetry are exponentially suppressed in
the presence of non-zero temperature.

we can use the supergravity calculation to study the eective electric and magnetic
couplings of the u(1) obtained after the breaking of su(n + 1)  su(n)  u(1)1 in fact,
since there is a potential for u, we cannot make this discussion when the consider the u(1)
quantum theory. so, we consider integrating out the su(n) degrees of freedom, and treat
the u(1) sub-theory as a source theory that is renormalized. in the near-horizon limit2 sf

the electric eld component ei is the source for fundamental strings in the xi direction. the

interchanges f and d strings and explains why m/ = /e.

2we assume imaginary time.
3from the gauge theory point of view, the correct scale is  in (3.9). however, using u does not change

the qualitative behavior of the eective couplings.

16

with the ultraviolet coupling e(u = ) = m(u = ) = . as one ows to the infrared, the
electric coupling decreases while the magnetic coupling decreases. when u = t 1/2 (the
horizon in supergravity) the electric coupling vanishes while the magnetic coupling blows up.
thus, the electric coupling is ir free while the magnetic coupling is ir strong. the region
inside the horizon describes the theory for energies below the thermal cuto. the region far
from the horizon corresponds to scales were supersymmetry is a good approximation.

we can analyze the system of -functions (5.20) beyond our specic solution. the general

solution can be written in the form

note that c1  0 if we require a reasonable uv limit. there are dierent types of behavior:
 c1 = 0, then c2 > 0 and m = 0 and e is an asymptotically free coupling that blows

up in the ir.

 c1 > 0 and c2 < 0. this behavior is the one realized in the d-brane system with

2 = c1 and c2 = 4t 42.

 c1, c2 = 0. this the generic xed point of this system of -functions with e = m =

constant.

 c1 > 0, c2 > 0. this situation is qualitatively similar to the c1 = 0 case but the

electric coupling has a non-zero uv value, while the magnetic coupling is ir free.

the running eective couplings in (5.19) are the physical eective u(1) couplings (as we
argued in the previous section). they constitute concrete predictions of supergravity for
spontaneously broken yang-mills theory in the large n limit. it would be interesting if they
could be compared to a dierent approach.

6 phenomenological implications

there are two eects presented above that merit an extra discussion. the rst is the fact
that the leading behavior of the vacuum energy induced in the probe brane scales as t 8/u4.
to decipher this dependence we will have to remind the reader the behavior of the vacuum
energy in a spontaneously broken supersymmetric theory. the vacuum one-loop diagram (in
four dimensions) has a well-known dependence on the cuto as well as the particle mass

in a supersymmetric theory the leading 4 terms are proportional to str[1] = # fermions-#
bosons. the subleading 2 terms are proportional to str[m2]. in a spontaneously broken
theory the soft masses are proportional to the helicities so that mass supertraces turn into
helicity supertraces [33, 34]. for an n = 4 theory str[m2] = 0 and the leading term

in string theory this divergence is absent [35] and the leading behaviour of the
energy.
vacuum energy is m 8
. this is the highest suppression known to be possible in the absence
m 4
of exact supersymmetry. it is also an interesting coincidence that the ratio of such a vacuum
energy to the natural one (namely m 4

planck) is 10120 for msu sy  10 tev.

there has been a revival lately of the the idea [36] that our four dimensional universe is
a three-brane, embedded in ten dimensional, (partially) compactied spacetime. this was
viable in situations with a very low string scale [37]-[47]. moreover, other three-branes may
be providing mirror universes. a prototype of this is the horava-witten interpretation of the
heterotic string [26]. a popular mechanism of supersymmetry breaking in our universe is
that supersymmetry breaks spontaneously (probably due to strong dynamics) on a spectator
brane and then this supersymmetry breaking is communicated via gravity to the universe
brane [48].

here we have a toy model of this situation. the spectator brane is the black-brane
while our universe is represented by the probe brane. supersymmetry is broken in the far-
away brane by thermal eects. although this might not be the exact way we would like
supersymmetry to be broken, it does represents soft supersymmetry breaking. both three-
branes carry n = 4 supersymmetry. there is only one dynamical scale in the problem
(when supersymmetry is unbroken): the distance or higgs expectation value, mdyn  u.
the supersymmetry breaking scale is given by the temperature, msusy  t .
the vacuum energy the result (3.10) which scales as m 4
as argued above, from broken n = 4 supersymmetry.

when msusy  mdyn then supersymmetry is strongly broken and we have obtained for
susy. this is the natural expectation,

in the opposite limit where the supersymmetry breaking scale is much smaller than the
dynamical scale, we nd that the cosmological constant induced in our universe due to super-
symmetry breaking on the spectator brane is much smaller: it scales as   m 8
dy n .
this is the scaling expected in a nite theory with maximal supersymmetry as argued pre-
viously. it is expected that the extra contributions to the vacuum energy on the universe
brane due to loops of brane elds will have extra suppression factors of the coupling constant,
[49]. moreover, there is an indication [28] that even n = 2 supersymmetry on the branes
might be enough to control in a similar fashion the vacuum energy in this context. the
observations above may be important for controlling the scale of the cosmological constant
of our universe after supersymmetry breaking.

su sy /m 4

the second issue to be commented upon concerns the fact that the eective velocity of
light on the probe brane is eld-dependent. this is due here to the black nature of the
spectator branes.

a variable velocity of light has a similar eect for the evolution of the universe as that
due to ination. this possibility has been investigated recently [27] and might provide a
viable alternative to ination. one of the main problems in such an approach is to nd a
natural dynamical evolution of the velocity of light, rather than an ad hoc variability and to
have a certain predictivity on the nature of interactions.

our example (although rather a toy example) provides a concrete dynamical framework
for a variable speed of light. the proposal here is that our brane-universe is the probe
brane falling towards the black brane. due to the fact that the eective velocity of light is

18

distance dependent as in (5.5), it becomes smaller with time passing. moreover, it induces
a robertson-walker type of metric on the probe brane. this setup deserves further study
in order to investigate the possibility of a concrete and realistic alternative to ination.
