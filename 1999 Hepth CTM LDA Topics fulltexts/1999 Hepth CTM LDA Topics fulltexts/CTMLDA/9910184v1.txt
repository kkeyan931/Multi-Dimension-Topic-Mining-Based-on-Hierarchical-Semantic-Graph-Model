abstract. we show that there are two dierent dualities of two dimensional gauge
theories with n = (2, 2) supersymmetry. one is basically a consequence of 3d mirror
symmetry. the non-linear sigma model with calabi-yau target space on the higgs
branch of the gauge theory is mapped into an equivalent non-linear sigma model on
the coulomb branch of the dual theory, realizing a t-dual target space with torsion.
the second duality is genuine to two dimensions. in addition to swapping higgs and
coulomb branch it trades twisted for untwisted multiplets, implying a sign ip of the
left moving u (1)r charge. succesive application of both dualities leads to geometric
mirror symmetry for the target space calabi-yau.

1. introduction

mirror symmetry of calabi-yau manifolds is one of the remarkable predictions of
type ii string theory. the (2, 2) superconformal eld theory associated with a string
propagating on a ricci-at kahler manifold has a u(1)l  u(1)r r-symmetry group,
and the hodge numbers of the manifold correspond to the charges of (r, r) ground
states under the r-symmetry. there is a symmetry in the conformal eld theory which
is a ip of the sign of the u(1)l current, jl  jl. if physically realized, this symmetry
implies existence of pairs of manifolds (m, w), which have mirror hodge diamonds,
h p,q(m) = h dp,q(w), and give rise to exactly the same superconformal eld theory.

while this observation predicts existence of mirror pairs of calabi-yau d-folds, it
is not constructive: one would like to know how to nd w if one is given a calabi-
yau manifold m. the mirror construction has been proposed on purely mathematical
grounds by batyrev for calabi-yau manifolds which can be realized as complete
intersections in toric varieties.

in [1], strominger, yau and zaslow argued that, for mirror symmetry to extend to a
symmetry of non-perturbative string theory, (m, w) must be t d brations, with bers
which are special lagrangian, and furthermore, that mirror symmetry is t d-duality of
the bers. the argument of syz is local, and is very well understood only for smooth
brations. to be able to fully exploit the idea, one must understand degenerations of
special lagrangian tori, or more generally, limits in which the calabi-yau manifold itself
becomes singular. some progress on how this is supposed to work has been made in
[1], [2], [3], and local mirror symmetry appears to be the simplest to understand in this
context.

in an a priori unrelated development initiated by [4] mirror pairs of gauge theories
were found. in the eld theory context, a duality in the sense of ir equivalence of two
gauge theories is usually referred to as a mirror symmetry if

 the duality swaps coulomb and higgs branch of the theories, trading fi terms for

mass parameters,

 the r-symmetry of the gauge theory has the product form gl  gr and duality

swaps the two factors.

the example of [4] studies n = 4 susy theories in 3 dimensions. recently it was
shown [5] that this duality can even be generalized to an equivalence of two theories at
all scales, a relation that will prove to be crucial for our applications.

the purpose of this note is to obtain geometrical mirror pairs by a worldsheet
construction. since there seems to be little hope that one can do so directly in the
non-linear sigma model (nlm), we study linear sigma models [6] which ow in the
ir to non-linear sigma models with calabi-yaus as their target spaces. string theory
oers a direct physical interpretations of these models as world-volume theory of a d-
string probe of the calabi-yau manifolds. we nd gauge theory mirror duality for the
linear sigma model which reduces to geometric mirror symmmetry for calabi-yau target
spaces.

using brane constructions t-dual to the d1 brane probe on m one can easily
construct gauge theories which ow to mirror manifolds. we will show that two dierent
dualities of d = 2, n = (2, 2) supersymmetric gauge theories arise: one has a realization
in string theory as s-duality of interval brane setups. this duality is a consequence of
mirror symmetry of d = 3, n = 2 eld theories where both the coulomb branch and the
higgs branch are described by non-compact calabi-yau manifolds. this duality in d = 3
maps a calabi yau manifold to an identical one, so while it is a non-trivial eld theory

 where by s-duality in type iia setups we mean a ip of the 2 and the 10 direction

3

statement, this does not provide a linear  model construction of the mirror calabi-
yau manifold. there exists another d = 2, n = (2, 2) eld theory duality obtained as
s-duality of the diamond brane constructions of [3]. this duality maps a theory whose
coulomb branch is dual to calabi-yau manifold m in the boring way described above,
to a theory whose higgs branch is the mirror manifold w. the composition of these
two dualities, therefore, ows to calabi-yau mirror symmetry. while we consider in this
note a very particular family on non-compact calabi-yau manifolds, the generalization
to arbitrary ane toric varieties is possible.

the organization of the note is as follows: in the next section we discuss dierent
possible dualities in two dimensions as obtained via brane constructions for the case of
the conifold. section three generalizes this discussion to sigma models built from branes
dual to more general non-compact cy manifolds and to the non-abelian case, describing
n d-brane probes on the singular cy. in the last section we present a detailed study of
the moduli space and argue that the composition of two dualities is calabi-yau mirror
symmetry.

2. mirror duality in 2d gauge theories

2.1. from three to two dimensions

the original d = 3 n = 4 of [4] upon compactication implies also a duality relation
in n = (4, 4) theories in 2 dimensions, as noted in [7, 8]. the recent results of [5] are
needed to make this precise. the nature of this duality with 8 supercharges will teach
us, how we should understand the n = (2, 2) examples. since in 2d the concept of a
moduli space is ill dened, equivalence of the ir physics does not require the moduli
spaces and metrics to match point by point, but only that the nlms on the moduli
space are equivalent, as we will see in several examples.

start with the 3d theory compactied on a circle. this is the setup analyzed in
[11]. it is governed by two length scales, g2
y m , the 3d yang-mills coupling, and r2, the
compactication radius. to ow to the deep ir is equivalent to sending both length
scales to zero. however physics still might depend on the dimensionless ratio

 = g2

y m r2.

as shown in [11], while the higgs branch metric is protected, the coulomb branch indeed
does depend on . for   1 we rst have to ow into the deep ir in 3d and then
compactify, resulting in a 2d nlm on the 3d quatum corrected coulomb branch. the
resulting target space is best described in terms of the dual photon in 3d, a scalar of
radius . for the mirror of the quiver (u(1) with nf electrons) it turns out to be an
alf space with radius . for small  we should rst compactify, express the theory in
terms of the wilson line, a scalar of radius 1
 , and obtain as a result a tube metric with
 or in the non-compact cy examples we are considering the two disjoint cfts of coulomb and higgs
branch [9, 10]

4

torsion, corresponding to the metric of an ns5 brane on a transverse circle of radius 1

[11, 12]. indeed these two nlms are believed to be equivalent [13] and exchanging the
dual photon for the wilson line amounts to the t-duality of ns5 branes and alf space
in terms of the ir nlm k.

in order to obtain linear -model description of this scenario, one has to use the
all scale mirror symmetry of [5]. they show that g2
y m maps to a fermi type coupling
in the mirror theory, or more precisely: one couples the gauge eld via a bf coupling
to a twisted gauge eld, the gauge coupling of the twisted gauge eld being baptised
fermi coupling. for the case of the quiver theory with fermi coupling, one obtains the
same alf space, this time on the higgs branch. in the same spirit we will present two
dierent dualities for n = (2, 2) theories.

2.2. mirror symmetry from the interval

one way to derive eld theory duality is to embed the eld theory into string theory
and then eld theory duality is a consequence of string duality. a construction of this
sort was implemented in [14] for the n = 4 theory in d=3 via brane congurations.
one uses an interval construction with the 3 basic ingredients: ns5 along 012345, d5
along 012789 and d3 along 0126. the two r-symmetries are su(2)345 and su(2)789.
d3 brane segments between ns5 branes give rise to vector multiplets, with the 3 scalars
in the 3 of su(2)345. d3 brane segments between d5 branes are hypermultiplets with
the four scalars transforming as 2 doublets of su(2)789.

under s-duality the d5 branes turn into ns5 branes and vice versa while d3 branes
stay invariant. one obtains the same kind of setup but with d5 and ns5 branes
interchanged. s-duality of type iib string theory is mirror symmetry in the gauge
theory.

now let us move on to the 2d theories. the brane realization of this duality is via
an interval theory in iia with ns and ns branes and d2 branes along 016 [15]. the
iia analog of s-duality, the 2-10 ip, takes this into d4 and d4 branes. the following
parameters dene the interval brane setup and the gauge theory:

 the seperation of ns and ns brane along 7 is the fi term. it receives a complex

partner, the 10 seperation which maps to the 2d theta angle.

 the seperation of the d4 branes along 2 and 3 gives twisted masses to the avors.

mirror symmetry maps the fi term to the twisted masses. a twisted mass sits in a
background vector multiplet and has to be contrasted with the standard mass from the

k this picture is obvious from the string theory perspective. studying a d2 d6 system on a circle,
going to the ir rst lifts us to an m2 on an alf space which becomes a fundamental string on the
alf, while going to 2d rst makes us t-dualize to d1 d5, leaving us with the  model of a string
probing a 5-brane background.
 to be precise, the s-dual theory will really contain a gauge theory of twisted hypers coupled to
twisted vectors. if in addition one performs a rotation taking 345 into 789 space, the two r-symmetries
are swapped and the theory is written in terms of vectors and hypers.

superpotential which sits in a background chiral multiplet. like the real mass in n = 2
theories in d = 3, it arises from terms like

5

z d4qevb q.

where vb is a background vector multiplet.
an example: as an example let us discuss the interval realization of the small
resolution of the conifold. as shown in [16, 17] by performing t6 t-duality on a d-
string probe of the conifold we get an interval realization of the conifold gauge theory in
terms of an elliptic iia setup with d2 branes stretched on a circle with one ns and one
ns brane. in this iia setup the seperation of the ns branes in 67 is the small resolution,
while turning on the diamond mode would be the deformation of the conifold.

the gauge group on the worldvolume of the d-string on the conifold is [18] a
u(1)  u(1) gauge group with 2 bifundamental avors a1, a2, b1 and b2. we can
factor out the decoupled center of mass motion, the diagonal u(1), which does not have
any charged matter and hence is free. we are left with an interacting u(1) with 2
avors. the scalar in the decoupled vector multiplet is the position of the d1 brane in
the 23 space transvere to the conifold. while the coulomb branch describes seperation
into fractional branes, the higgs branch describes motion on the internal space and
reproduces the conifold geometry. the complexied blowup mode for resolving the
conifold is the fi term and the  angle.

after 2-10 ip, the dual brane setup is again an elliptic model, this time with one
d4 and one d4 brane. the gauge theory is a single n = (8, 8) u(1) from the d2 brane
with 2 additional n = (2, 2) matter avors from the d4 and d4 brane. that is we have

 3 adjoints, that is singlet elds x, y and z and
 matter elds q, q, t and t with charges +1,-1,+1,-1.
 they couple via a superpotential

w = qx q + t x t .

 the singlet z is decoupled and corresponds to the center of mass motion.

turning on the fi term and the  angle in the original theory is a motion of the ns
brane along the 7 and 10 direction respectively. it maps into a 23 motion for the d4
brane, giving a twisted mass to q and q.

this analysis can also be performed by going to the t-dual picture of d1 branes
probing d5 branes intersecting in codimension 2, that is over 4 common directions.
aspects of this setup and its t-dual cousins in various dimensions have already been
studied by numerous authors, e.g. for the d3 d7 d7 system in [19] or for the d0 d4
d4 in [20]. the resulting gauge theory agrees with what we have found by applying
the standard interval rules.

6

2.3. twisted mirror symmetry from diamonds

a second t-dual conguration for d1 brane probes of singular cy manifolds is d3
branes ending on a curve of ns branes, called diamonds in [3]. these setups are the
t48-duals of d1 brane probes of the ckl spaces. indeed it was this relation that allowed
us to derive the diamond matter content to begin with [3]. in order to use the diamond
construction to see mirror symmetry, we use s-duality of string theory, as in the original
work of [14]. let us rst consider the parameters dening a diamond and how they map
under s-duality:

 the complex parameter dening the ns brane diamond contains the fi term which

is paired up with the 2d  angle,

 the s-dual d5-brane diamond is dened by a complex parameter which is derived

from a superpotential mass term.

fi term and theta angle are contained in a background twisted chiral multiplet. under
the duality this twisted chiral multiplet is mapped to a background chiral multiplet
containing the mass term. since ordinary mirror symmetry mapped fi terms to mass
terms in twisted chiral multiplet, the map of operators under the two versions of duality
will be dierent.
an example: let us start once more with the simplest example, the d1 string on the
blowup of the conifold. that is, we consider a single diamond, one ns and one ns
brane, on a torus. after s-duality this elliptic model with ns5 and ns5 brane turns
into an elliptic model with d5 and d5 brane. since we have only d-branes in this
dual picture, the matter content can be analyzed by perturbative string techniques. to
shortcut, we perform t48 duality to the d1 d5 d5 system as in the interval setup. for
the special example of the conifold the two possible mirrors do not dier in the gauge
and matter content, only in the parameter map. this will not be the case in the more
general examples considered below.

as analyzed above, the corresponding dual gauge theory is a u(1) gauge group with
3 neutral elds x, y and z and two avors q, q, t and t with charges +1, 1, +1,
1 respectively. the superpotential in the singular case is w = qx q + t y t .

by s-duality, as in the ns ns setup, turning on the d5-brane diamonds corresponds
turning on vevs for the d=4 hypermultiplets from the d5 d5 strings. under n = (2, 2)
these hypermultiplets decompose into background chiral multiplets and hence appear
if we call those chiral multiplets h and h the
as parameters in the superpotential.
corresponding superpotential contributions are [20] qh t + qht , so that all in all the
full superpotential reads

w = qx q + t y t + qh t + qht.

7

3. more mirror pairs

3.1. other singular cy spaces

according to the analysis of [16, 3], d1 brane probes on the blowup of spaces of the
form

gkl : xy = ukvl

are t6 dual to an interval setup with k ns and l ns branes. the gauge group is
a u(1)k+l1 with bifundamental matter.
it is straight forward to construct interval
mirrors via the 2-10 ip in terms of a u(1) with 2 singlets and k + l avors. the k + l  1
complexied fi terms map into the k + l  1 independend twisted mass terms (one
twisted mass can be absorbed by redening the origin of the coulomb branch).

similarly we can construct diamond mirrors for d1 brane probes of ckl spaces,

ckl : xy = zk, uv = zl.

the gauge group for the d1 brane probe is u(1)2kl1. the mirror is once more a single
u(1) with 2 singlets and k + l avors. this time (k + 1)(l + 1)  3 complexied fi terms
map to superpotential masses. note that, while the d1-brane gauge theory has 2kl  1
fi terms, only (k + 1)(l + 1)  3 lead to independent deformations of the moduli space.
this is a consequence of the fact the d1 brane gauge theory is not the minimal linear
sigma model of ckl, which is just a u(1)(k+1)(l+1)3 (the same phenomenon arises in the
case of c3/ orbifolds [21]).

3.2. generalization to non-abelian gauge groups

our realization in terms of brane setups gives us for free the non-abelian version of the
story, the mirror dual of n d1 branes sitting on top of the conifold. let us spell out the
dual pairs once more in the simple example of the conifold. generalization to arbitrary
gkl and ckl spaces is straight forward. the gauge group on n d1 branes on the blowup
of the conifold is [18]

su(n)  su(n)  u(1)

where we already omitted the decoupled center of mass vm. the matter content consists
of 2 bifundamental avors a1,2, b1,2. they couple via a superpotential

w = a1b1a2b2  a1b2a2b1.

the diamond mirror of this theory is a single u(n) gauge groups with 3 adjoints + x,
y and z and 2 fundamental avors q, q, t , t coupling via a superpotential:

w = x[y, z] + qx q + t y t + hq t + h qt

where h and h are the same background parameters determining the diamond as in the
abelian case.

+ and here by adjoint we really mean a u (n ) adjoint, that is a su (n ) adjoint and a singlet. the
singlet in z once more corresponds to the overall center of mass motion and decouples.

8

4. geometric mirror symmetry from linear sigma models

the basic conjecture is that applying both dualities succesively maps the lm for a
given calabi-yau to the lm on the mirror. the parameter map we have presented
above implies that the dual theory is formulated in terms of twisted multiplets, realizing
the required ip in the r-charge.

in order to support our conjecture, let us do the calculation for the single d1 brane
probe on a ckl space. by construction the higgs branch of the gauge theory we start
with is the blownup ckl space. the twisted mirror of this theory is a u(1) gauge theory
coupled to k+l avors q, q and t , t and two singlet elds x and y . the superpotential
takes the form

xa=1

ta(y  ba) t a +xia

where h and h are background hypermultiplets parametrizing the diamonds and the ai
and ba are the relative positions of the d5 and d5 branes in the d1 d5 d5 picture

along 45 and 89 respectively; p ai =p ba = 0.

according to the conjecture we now must nd the ordinary mirror of this theory,
it is claimed, will be the mirror manifold. ordinary mirror
whose higgs branch,
symmetry derives from 3d mirror symmetry. in three dimensions the higgs branch of
the mirror theory is the same as the quatum corrected coulomb branch of the original
one. for the purpose of computing the mirror of the ckl space it suces therefore to
calculate the eective coulomb branch of the 3d u(1) gauge theory with k + l avors
and superpotential eq.(1).

first let us study the classical moduli space. the d-term equations require

|qi|2  | qi|2 +

k

xi=1

l

xa=1

|ta|2  | t a|2 = 0

the f-term requirements for the q, t , q and t elds are

n  q

t ! = 0,

( q, t )n t = 0

where n is the k + l by k + l matrix

n =  diag{x  a1, x  a2, . . . , x  ak}

h

diag{y  b1, y  b2, . . . , y  bl} !

in addition the scalar potential contains the standard piece

|qi|2 + | qi|2 +

|ta|2 + | t a|2)

l

xa=1

from the coupling of the scalar  in the vector multiplet to the matter elds and the
f-terms for x and y . the classical coulomb branch is three complex dimensional

9

parametrized by x, y and  + i, where  is the dual photon. along this branch, q,
q, t and t are zero. the coulomb branch meets the higgs branch along the curve 

det(n) = 0.

now consider the quantum coulomb branch. as shown in [22] the quantum
coulomb branch of a u(1) theory with nf = k + l avors has an eective description
in terms of chiral elds v+ and v and a superpotential

wef f = nf (v+v det(m))1/nf .

m is the k + l by k + l meson matrix

m =  qi qj qi t b

ta qj ta t b ! .

far out on the coulomb branch v are related to the classical variables via v 
e1/g2(+i). adding the tree level superpotential eq.(1) written in the compact form

tr (nm)

to this eective superpotential, the m f-term equations describing our quantum
coulomb branch read

n  (v+v)1/nf

h

det(m)11/nf

= 0

(2)

where

h =

det(m)

m 

taking the determinant in eq.(2) we nd that the quantum coulomb branch is described
by a hypersurface

det(n) = v+v.

this is precisely the mirror manifold of ckl [23]. since the origin v+ = v = x = y = 0
is no longer part of this branch of moduli space, we arrive at a smooth solution even so
we started from the eective superpotential of [22] that is singular at the origin.

we here considered only mirror symmetry for ckl spaces. since any ane toric cy
can be imbedded in ckl for suciently large k and l, mirror symmetry for all such spaces
follows by deformation.
