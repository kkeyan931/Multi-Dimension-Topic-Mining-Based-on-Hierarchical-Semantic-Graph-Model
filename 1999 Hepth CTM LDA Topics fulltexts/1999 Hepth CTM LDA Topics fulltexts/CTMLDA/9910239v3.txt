virtue of the -mapping method, we show that the topological defects are

generated from the zero points of the order parameter eld ~, and the topo-

logical charges of these topological defects are topological quantized in terms

of the hopf indices and brouwer degrees of -mapping under the condition

i. introduction

the world of topological defects is amazingly rich and have been the focus of much

attention in many areas of contemporary physics [13]. the importance of the role of

defects in understanding a variety of problems in physics is clear [47]. whenever we have

a eld theory with a set of vacua given by a non-connected space there is the possibility of

having dierent regions in space living on dierent vacuum sectors. two such regions will

meet at what is generally named a topological defect, i.e. a thin hypersurface where the

eld rapidly evolves from one vacuum to the other [8].

as a edivence of cosmological phase transitions in the early universe, topological de-

fects, such as cosmic string, domain wall, monopole and texture, remain somewhere in our

universe, and can help to resolve some long standing puzzles such as the origin of structure

formation [9]. the physics of spacetimes containing the defects has been investigated exten-

sively [10]. the existence of topological defects [2,10] with a non-trivial core phase structure

has recently been demonstrated for embeded global domain walls and vortices [11]. a solu-

tion for a schwarzschild particle with global monopole charge has been obtained by barriola

and vilenkin [2]. the texture model of structure formation in the universe [12] and the

onetexture universe [13] have been studied by many researchers [14]. pbranes [15], which

have been found to play important roles in mtheory [16], are also proved to be topological

defects in gauge theory [17]. recently, some physicists noticed [18] that the topological de-

fects are closely related to the spontaneously broken of o(m) symmetry group to o(m  1)
by mcomponent order parameter eld ~ and pointed out that for m = 1, one has domain

walls, m = 2, strings and m = 3, monopoles, for m = 4, there are textures. and o(m)

symmetric vector eld theories are a class of models describing the critical behavior of an

great variety of important physical systems [19,20]. but for the lack of a powerful method,

the topological properties of these systems are not very clear, some important topological

informations have been lost, also the unied theory of describing the topological properties

of all these defect objects is not established yet.

3

in this paper, in the light of mapping topological current theory [21], a useful method

which plays a important role in studying the topological invariants [22,23] and the topological

structures of physical systems [24,25], we will investigate the topological quantization and

the branch process of arbitrary dimensional topological defects. we will show that the

topological defects are generated from the zero points of the order parameter eld ~, and

their topological charges are quantized in terms of the hopf indices and brouwer degrees

of -mapping under the condition that the zero points of eld ~ are regular points. while

at the critical points of the order parameter eld ~, i.e. the limit points and bifurcation

points, there exist branch processes, the topological current of defect bifurcates and the

topological defects split or merge at such point, this means that the topological defects

system is unstable at these points.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we investigate the topological quantiza-

tion of these topological defect and point out that the topological charges of these defects

are the winding numbers which are determined by the hopf indices and the brouwer de-

grees of the mapping. in section 3, we study the branch process of the defect topological

current at the limit points, bifurcation points and higher degenerated points systematically

by virtue of the mapping theory and the implicit function theorem.

ii. topological quantization of topological defects

in our previous papers [21,2528], we have studied the topological properties of point

like defects and string like defects systematically via the -mapping topological current

theory and rank-2 topological current theory, respectively. in this paper, in order to study

the topological properties of arbitrary dimensional topological defects, we will extend the

concept to present an arbitrary dimensional generalized topological current.

it is well known that the mcomponent vector order parameter eld ~(x) =

(1(x), ..., m(x)) determines the properties of the topological defect system, and it can

be looked upon as a smooth mapping between the ndimensional riemannian spacetime g

4

(with the metric tensor g and local coordinates x (,  = 1, ..., n)) and a mdimensional
euclidean space rm as  : g  rm. by analogy with the discussion in our previous work
[2528], from this -mapping, one can deduce a topological tensor current as

j1k =

1

a(sm1)(m  1)!gx

1kk+1na1amk+1na1k+2na2    nnam.

(1)

to describe the system of the topological defects, where k = n  m. in this expression, 
stands for /x, a(sm1) = 2m/2/(m/2) is the area of (m  1)dimensional unit sphere
sm1 and na(x) is the direction eld of the mcomponent order parameter eld ~

na(x) =

a(x)
||(x)||

,

||(x)|| = qa(x)a(x)

(2)

with na(x)na(x) = 1. it is obviously that na(x) is a section of the sphere bundle s(g) [21]
and it can be looked upon as a map of g onto a (m  1)dimensional unit sphere sm1 in
order parameter space. clearly, the zero points of the order parameter eld ~(x) are just

the singular points of the unit vector na(x). it is easy to see that j1k are completely

antisymmetric, and from the formulas above, we conclude that there exists a conservative

equation of the topological tensor current in (1)

ij1k = 0,

i = 1, ..., k.

in the following, we will investigate the intrinsic structure of the generalized topological

current j1k by making use of the mapping method. from (2), we have

na =

1
||||

a + a(

),

1
||||


a (

1
||||

) = 

a
||||3

which should be looked upon as generalized functions [29]. due to these expressions the

generalized topological current (1) can be rewritten as

j1k = cm

1
gx

1kk+1na1am

 k+1a    nam 

a



a1

(gm(||||)),

(3)

where cm is a constant

5



cm = 

and gm(||||) is a green function
gm(||||) =

ln|||| , m = 2

a1amj 1k(

) = 1kk+1nk+1a1k+2a2    nam

and by making use of the mdimensional laplacian green function relation in space [21]

(gm(||||)) = 

4m/2
2  1)

( m

(~)

where  = (

2

aa ) is the mdimensional laplacian operator in space, we do obtain the

function structure of the defect topological current rigorously

j1k =

1
gx

(~)j 1k(


x

).

(4)

this expression involves the total defect information of the system and it indicates that

all the defects are located at the zero points of the order parameter eld ~(x).

it must

be pointed out that, comparing to similar expressions in other papers, the results in (4) is
gotten theoretically in a natural way. we nd that j1k 6= 0 only when ~ = 0, which is
just the singularity of j1k. in detail, the kernel of the mapping is the singularities of

the topological tensor current j1k in g, i.e. the inner structure of the topological tensor

current is labelled by the zeroes of -mapping. we think that this is the essential of the

topological tensor current theory and mapping is the key to study this theory.

from the above discussions, we see that the kernel of mapping plays an important role

in the topological tensor current theory, so we are focussed on the zero points of ~ and will

search for the solutions of the equations a(x) = 0 (a = 1, ..., m) by means of the implicit

function theorem. these points are topological singularities in the orientation of the order

parameter eld ~(x).

6

suppose that the vector eld ~(x) possesses l zeroes, according to the implicit function

theorem [30], when the zeroes are regular points of mapping at which the rank of the

jacobian matrix [a] is m, the solutions of ~ = 0 can be expressed parameterizedly by

x = z

i (u1,  , uk),

i = 1, ..., l,

(5)

where the subscript i represents the ith solution and the parameters ui (i = 1, ..., k) span a

kdimensional submanifold with the metric tensor gij = g

x
ui

x
uj which is called the ith

singular submanifold ni in the riemannian manifold g corresponding to the mapping.

these singular submanifolds ni are just the world volumes of the topological defects. for

each singular manifold ni, we can dene a normal submanifold mi in g which is spanned

by the parameters va with the metric tensor gab = g

x
va

x
vb (a, b = 1, ..., m), and the

intersection point of mi and ni is denoted by pi which can be expressed parameterizedly by

va = pa

i . in fact, in the words of dierential topology, mi is transversal to ni at the point

pi. by virtue of the implicit function theorem at the regular point pi, it should be held true

that the jacobian matrices j( 

v ) satises

j(


v

) =

d(1,  , m)
d(v1,  , vm) 6= 0.

(6)

in the following, we will investigate the topological charges of the topological defects

and their quantization. let i be a neighborhood of pi on mi with boundary i satisfying
pi / i, i  j = . then the generalized winding number wi of na(x) at pi [31] can be
dened by the gauss map n : i  sm1
a(sm1)(m  1)! zi

n(a1amna1dna2      dnam)

(7)

wi =

1

where n denotes the pull back of map n. the generalized winding numbers is a topological

invariant and is also called the degree of gauss map [32]. it means that, when the point

va covers i once, the unit vector na will cover a region n[i] whose area is wi times of

a(sm1), i.e. the unit vector na will cover the unit sphere sm1 for wi times. using the

stokes theorem in exterior dierential form and duplicating the above process, we get the

compact form of wi

7

wi = zi

(~)j(


v

)dmv.

by analogy with the procedure of deducing (f (x)), since

(~) = 


+, f or ~(x) = 0
f or ~(x) 6= 0
0,

we can expand the function (~) as

+, f or x  ni
f or x / ni
0,

,

(~) =

ci(ni),

(9)

(10)

where the coecients ci must be positive, i.e. ci =| ci |. (ni) is the function in space-time
g on a submanifold ni [29]

(ni) = zni

1
gx

n(~x  ~zi(u1,  , uk))gudku,

(11)

where gx = det(g), gu = det(gij ). substituting (10) into (8), and calculating the integral,

we get the expression of ci

ci =

igv
| j( 
v )pi |

=

iigv
j( 
v )pi

,

gv = det(gab),

(12)

where i = |wi| is a positive integer called the hopf index [32] of -mapping on mi, it
means that when the point v covers the neighborhood of the zero point pi once, the function

~ covers the corresponding region in ~-space i times, and i = signj( 

v )pi = 1 is the
brouwer degree of -mapping [32]. substituting this expression of ci and (10) into (4), we

gain the total expansion of the rankk topological current

j1k =

(13)

from the above equation, we conclude that the inner structure of j1k or ja

k is labelled

by the total expansion of (~), which includes the topological information i and i.

8

taking u1 and ui (i = 2, ..., k) be time-like evolution parameter and space-like parame-

ters, respectively, the inner structure of the generalized topological current just represents l

(k  1)dimensional topological defects with topological charges gi = ii moving in the n
dimensional riemann manifold g. the k-dimensional singular submanifolds ni (i = 1, l)
are their world sheets in the space-time. mazenko [19] and halperin [20] also got simi-

lar results for the case of point-like defects and line defects, but unfortunately, they did

not consider the case i 6= 1. in fact, what they lost sight of is just the most important
topological information for the charge of topological defecs. in detail, the hopf indices i

characterize the absolute values of the topological charges of these defects and the brouwer

degrees i = +1 correspond to defects while i = 1 to antidefects. furthermore, they did
not discuss what will happen when i is indenite, which we will study in detail in section

3.

corresponding to the rankk topological tensor currents j1k, it is easy to see that the

lagrangian of many defects is just

l = s 1

k!

g11    gkkj1kj1k = (~)

which includes the total information of arbitrary dimensional topological defects in g and

is the generalization of nielsens lagrangian [33]. the action in g is expressed by

lgxdnx =

s = zg

l

xi=1

iizni

gudku =

xi=1

where si is the area of the singular manifold ni. it must be pointed out here that the nambu

goto action [34], which is the basis of many works on defect theory, is derived naturally

from our theory. from the principle of least action, we obtain the evolution equations of

many defect objects

(14)

as a matter of fact, this is just the equation of harmonic map [35].

iii. the branch processes of the topological defects

with the discussion mentioned above, we know that the results in the above section

are obtained straightly from the topological view point under the condition j(/v)|pi 6= 0,
i.e. at the regular points of the order parameter eld ~. when the condition fails, i.e. the

brouwer degree i are indenite, what will happen? in what follows, we will study the case
when j(/v)|pi = 0. it often happens when the zero points of eld ~ include some branch
points, which lead to the bifurcation of the topological current.

in this section, we will discuss the branch processes of these topological defects. in order

to simplify our study, we select the parameter u1 as the timelike evolution parameter t,

and let the spacelike parameters ui = i (i = 2, ..., k) be xed. in this case, the jacobian

matrices j a



1a



k( 

y ) are reduced to

j ai1ik1(


y

)  j a(


y

),

j abi1ik2(


y

) = 0,

j (m+1)n(


y

) = j(


v

),

a, b = 1, ..., (m + 1),

ij = m + 2, ..., n,

(15)

for ya = va (a  m), ym+1 = t, ym+i = i (i  2). the branch points are determined by
the m + 1 equations

and

a(v1,   , vm, t, ~) = 0, a = 1, ..., m

m+1(v1,   , vm, t, ~)  j(


v

) = 0

(16)

(17)

for the xed ~. and they are denoted as (t, pi). in mapping theory usually there are two

kinds of branch points, namely the limit points and bifurcation points [36], satisfying

and

j 1(


y

)|(t,pi) 6= 0

10

(18)

j 1(


y

)|(t,pi) = 0,

(19)

respectively. in the following, we assume that the branch points (t, pi) of mapping have

been found.

a. branch process at the limit point

we rst discuss the branch process at the limit point satisfying the condition (18). in

order to use the theorem of implicit function to study the branch process of topological

defects at the limit point, we use the jacobian j 1( 

v ) to discuss the problem.
in fact, this means that we have replaced the parameter t by v1. for clarity we rewrite the

y ) instead of j( 

problem as

a(t, v2,   , vm, v1, ~) = 0,

a = 1, ..., m.

(20)

then, taking account of the condition(18) and using the implicit function theorem, we have

an unique solution of the equations (20) in the neighborhood of the limit point (t, pi)

t = t(v1, ~),

vi = vi(v1, ~),

i = 2, 3, ..., m

(21)

with t = t(p1

i , ~). in order to show the behavior of the defects at the limit points, we will

investigate the taylor expansion of (21) in the neighborhood of (t, pi). in the present case,

from (18) and (17), we get

i.e.

dv1
dt |(t,pi) =

j 1( 
y )
y ) |(t,pi) = ,
j( 

dt
dv1|(t,pi) = 0.

then we have the taylor expansion of (21) at the point (t, pi)

t = t(pi, ~) +

dt
dv1|(t,pi)(v1  p1

i ) +

d2t

(dv1)2|(t,pi)(x1  p1

11

= t +

1
2

d2t
(dv1)2|(t,pi)(v1  p1

i )2.

therefore

t  t =

1
2

d2t
i )2
(dv1)2|(t,pi)(v1  p1

(22)

which is a parabola in the v1t plane. from (22), we can obtain the two solutions v1

(1)(t, ~)

d2t

(2)(t, ~), which give the branch solutions of the system (16) at the limit point.

and v1
if
(dv1)2|(t,pi) > 0, we have the branch solutions for t > t (fig 1(a)), otherwise, we have the
branch solutions for t < t (fig 1(b)). the former is related to the creation of defect and

antidefect in pair at the limit points, and the latter to the annihilation of the topological

defects, since the topological current of topological defects is identically conserved, the

topological quantum numbers of these two generated topological defects must be opposite

at the limit point, i.e. 11 + 22 = 0.

b. branch process at the bifurcation point

in the following, let us consider the case (19), in which the restrictions of the system

(16) at the bifurcation point (t, pi) are

j(


v

)|(t,pi) = 0, j(


v

)|(t,pi) = 0.

(23)

these two restrictive conditions will lead to an important fact that the dependency relation-

ship between t and v1 is not unique in the neighborhood of the bifurcation point (t, pi). in

fact, we have

dv1
dt |(t,pi) =

j 1( 
y )
v ) |(t,pi)
j( 

(24)

which under the restraint (23) directly shows that the tangential direction of the integral

curve of equation (24) is indenite at the point (t, pi). hence, (24) does not satisfy the

conditions of the existence and uniqueness theorem of the solution of a dierential equation.

this is why the very point (t, ~zi) is called the bifurcation point of the system (16).

12

in the following, we will nd a simple way to search for the dierent directions of all

branch curves at the bifurcation point. as assumed that the bifurcation point (t, pi) has

been found from (16) and (17), the following calculations are all conducted at the value

(t, pi). as we have mentioned above, at the bifurcation point (t, pi), the rank of the

jacobian matrix [ 

v ] is smaller than m.

in order to derive the calculating method, we

consider the rank of the jacobian matrix [ 
v ] is m 1. the case of a more smaller rank will
be discussed in next subsection. suppose that one of the (m 1) (m 1) submatrix j1( 
v )
of the jacobian matrix [ 

v ] is

j1(

(25)

and its determinant det j1( 

v ) does not vanish at the point (t, pi) (otherwise, we have to
a stands for (a/va) (a = 1, ..., m  1; a =
2, ..., m). by means of the implicit function theorem we obtain one and only one functional

rearrange the equations of (16)), where a

relationship in the neighborhood of the bifurcation point (t, pi)

va = f a(v1, t, 2,   , k),

a = 2, 3, ..., n

(26)

with the partial derivatives

f a

va
v1 ,

f a
t =

va
t

, a = 2, 3, ..., n.

then, for a = 1, ..., m  1 we have

a = a(v1, f 2(v1, t, ~), ..., f m(v1, t, ~), t, ~)  0

which gives

from which we can calculate the rst order derivatives of f a : f a

f a
11 =

2va
(v1)2 , f a

1t =

and dierentiating (27) with respect to v1 and t respectively, we get

the dierentiation of (28) with respect to v1 gives the same expression as (30). if we use

the gaussian elimination method to the three vectors at the right hands of the formulas

(29), (30) and (31), we can obtain the three partial derivatives f a

11, f a

1t and f a

tt . notice that

the three equations (29), (30) and (31) have the same coecient matrix j1( 

v ), which are
assumed to be nonzero, and we should substitute the values of the partial derivatives f a
1

and f a

t , which have been calculated out in the former, into the right hands of the three

equations.

the above discussions do not matter to the last component m(v1,, vm, t, ~). in order
to nd the dierent values of dv1/dt at the bifurcation point, let us investigate the taylor
expansion of m(v1,  , vm, t, ~) in the neighborhood of (t, pi). substituting the existing,
but unknown, dependency relationship (26) into m(v1,  , vm, t, ~), we get the function of
two variables v1 and t

14

f (t, v1, ~) = m(v1, f 2(v1, t, ~), ..., f m(v1, t, ~), t, ~)

which according to (16) must vanish at the bifurcation point

f (t, pi) = 0.

(32)

(33)

from (32), we can calculate the rst order partial derivatives of f (t, v1, ~) with respect to

v1 and t respectively at the bifurcation point (t, pi)

since

=

det j1(


v

)|(t,pi) 6= 0

which is our assumption, the above equation leads to

15

f
v1|(t,pi) = 0.

with the same reasons, we can prove that

f
t |(t,pi) = 0.

(35)

(36)

the second order partial derivatives of the function f (t, v1, ~) are easily to nd out to be

(37)

then, by virtue of (33), (35), (36) and (37), the taylor expansion of f (t, v1, ~) in the

neighborhood of the bifurcation point (t, pi) can be expressed as

f (t, v1, ~) =

1
2

a(v1  p1

i )2 + b(v1  p1

i )(t  t) +

1
2

c(t  t)2

(38)

which is the expression of m(v1,   , vm, t, ~) in the neighborhood of (t, pi). the expression
(38) shows that at the bifurcation point (t, pi)

a(v1  p1

i )2 + 2b(v1  p1

i )(t  t) + c(t  t)2 = 0.

(39)

dividing (39) by (v1  p1
respectively, we get two equations

i )2 or (t  t)2, and taking the limit t  t as well as v1  p1

i

c(

dv1 )2 + 2b

dt
dv1 + a = 0.

(40)

and

16

a(

dv1

)2 + 2b

dv1

+ c = 0.

(41)

so we get the dierent directions of the branch curves at the bifurcation point from the

solutions of (40) or (41). there are four possible cases:

firstly, a 6= 0,  = 4(b2  ac) > 0, from eq. (40) we get two dierent solutions:
dv1/dt |1,2= (b  b2  ac)/a, which is shown in fig. 2, where two topological defects
meet and then depart at the bifurcation point. secondly, a 6= 0,  = 4(b2ac) = 0, there
is only one solution: dv1/dt = b/a, which includes three important cases: (a) two topo-
logical defects tangentially collide at the bifurcation point (fig 3(a)); (b) two topological

defects merge into one topological defect at the bifurcation point (fig 3(b)); (c) one topo-

logical defect splits into two topological defects at the bifurcation point (fig 3(c)). thirdly,
a = 0, c 6= 0,  = 4(b2  ac) > 0, from eq. (41) we have dt/dv1 = 0 and 2b/c. there
are two important cases: (i) one topological defect splits into three topological defects at the

bifurcation point (fig 4(a)); (ii) three topological defects merge into one at the bifurcation

point (fig 4(b)). finally, a = c = 0, eqs. (40) and (41) give respectively dv1/dt = 0 and

dt/dv1 = 0. this case is obvious as in fig. 5, which is similar to the third situation.

in order to determine the branches directions of the remainder variables, we will use the

relations simply

dva = f a

1 dv1 + f a

t dt,

a = 2, 3, ..., n

where the partial derivative coecients f a

1 and f a

t have given in (27) and (28). then,

respectively

or

dva
dv1 = f a

1 + f a
t

dt
dv1

dva
dt

= f a
1

dv1
dt

+ f a
t .

(42)

where partial derivative coecients f a

1 and f a

t are given by (27) and (28). from this relations

we nd that the values of dva/dt at the bifurcation point (t, zi) are also possibly dierent

because (41) may give dierent values of dv1/dt.

17

c. branch process at a higher degenerated point

in the following, let us discuss the branch process at a higher degenerated point. in the

above subsection, we have analysised the case that the rank of the jacobian matrix [/v]

of the equation (17) is m  1. in this section, we consider the case that the rank of the
jacobian matrix is m  2 (for the case that the rank of the matrix [/v] is lower than
m  2, the discussion is in the same way). let the (m  2)  (m  2) submatrix j2( 
v ) of
the jacobian matrix [/v] be

j2(


v

) =

1
3

2
3
...

1
4

2
4
...

m2
3

m2
4





m

m

   1
   2
...
. . .
   m2

m





and suppose that det j2( 

v )|(t,pi) 6= 0. with the same reasons of obtaining (26), we can have

the function relations

va = f a(v1, v2, t, ~),

a = 3, 4, ..., m.

(43)

for the partial derivatives f a

1 , f a

2 and f a

t , we can easily derive the system similar to the

equations (27) and (28), in which the three terms at the right hand of can be gured out

at the same time. in order to determine the 2order partial derivatives f a

11, f a

12, f a

1t, f a

22, f a
2t

and f a

tt , we can use the equations similar to (29), (30) and (31). substituting the relations

(43) into the last two equations of the system (16), we have the following two equations with

respect to the arguments v1, v2, t, ~

f1(v1, v2, t, ~) = m1(v1, v2, f 3(v1, v2, t, ~),   , f m(v1, v2, t, ~), t, ~) = 0
f2(v1, v2, t, ~) = m(v1, v2, f 3(v1, v2, t, ~),   , f m(v1, v2, t, ~), t, ~) = 0.

(44)

calculating the partial derivatives of the function f1 and f2 with respect to v1, v2 and t,




taking notice of (43) and using six similar expressions to (35) and (36), i.e.

fj
v1 |(t,pi)= 0,

fj
v2 |(t,pi)= 0,

fj
t

|(t,pi)= 0,

j = 1, 2,

(45)

18

we have the following forms of taylor expressions of f1 and f2 in the neighborhood of (t, pi)

fj(v1, v2, t, ~)  aj1(v1  p1

i )2 + aj2(v1  p1

i )(v2  p2

i ) + aj3(v1  p1
i )

(t  t) + aj4(v2  p2

i )2 + aj5(v2  p2

i )(t  t) + aj6(t  t)2 = 0

j = 1, 2.

(46)

in the case of aj1 6= 0, aj4 6= 0, by dividing (46) by (t  t)2 and taking the limit t  t, we
obtain two quadratic equations of dv1

dt and dv2

dt

aj1(

dv1

)2 + aj2

dv1
dt

dv2
dt

+ aj3

dv1
dt

+ aj4(

dv2
dt

)2 + aj5

dv2
dt

+ aj6 = 0

(47)

eliminating the variable dv1/dt, we obtain a equation of dv2/dt in the form of a determinant

j = 1, 2.

where q = dv2/dt, which is a 4th order equation of dv2/dt

(49)

therefore we get dierent directions at the bifurcation point corresponding to dierent

branch curves. the number of dierent branch curves is four at most.

if the degree of

degeneracy of the matrix [ 

v ] is more higher, i.e.

v ] is more
lower than the present (m  2) case, the procedure of deduction will be more complicate.
in general supposing the rank of the matrix [ 
x ] be (m  s), the number of the possible

the rank of the matrix [ 

dierent directions of the branch curves is 2s at most.

19

at the end of this section, we conclude that there exist crucial cases of branch processes in

our topological defect theory. this means that a topological defect, at the bifurcation point,

may split into several (for instance s) topological defects along dierent branch curves with

dierent charges. since the topological current is a conserved current, the total quantum

number of the spliting topological defects must precisely equal to the topological charge of

the original defect i.e.

s

xj=1

ij ij = ii

for xed i. this can be looked upon as the topological reason of the defect splitting. here

we should point out that such splitting is a stochastic process, the sole restriction of this

process is just the conservation of the topological charge of the topological defects during

this splitting process. of course, the topological charge of each splitting defects is an integer.

in summary, we have studied the topological property of the arbitrary dimensional topo-

logical defects in general case by making use of the mapping topological current theory and

the implicit function theorem. we would like to point out that all the results in this paper

are gained from the viewpoint of topology without any particular models or hypothesis.
