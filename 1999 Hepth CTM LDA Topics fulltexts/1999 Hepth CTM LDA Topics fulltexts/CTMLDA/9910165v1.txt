abstract

we generalize eective energy variational techniques to study appropriately
quantized solitonic eld congurations. our approach rests on collective quan-
tization ideas and is specically designed for the numerical evaluation of soliton
parameters. we employ this method to obtain the one-loop quantum corrections
to the soliton mass and form factor. special attention is given to the regularization
of the physical observables in the solitonic sector of the theory. the numerical im-
plementation of the method is demonstrated for a simple one-dimensional scalar
eld example.

introduction

the dilemma between our classical visualization of a soliton as a compact object and the
plane-wave nature of its energy and momentum quantum eigenstates is as common as
the quantum description of any composite particle. not surprisingly, this problem has
been approached with diversity of techniques[16] such as functional integral, canonical
quantization, semi-classical and variational procedures. the methods that have already
been developed are able to provide reasonable qualitative understanding of the physics
behind a quantized soliton but, as a rule, they are analytically tractable only for
the simplest models, mostly in one space dimension. whenever it comes to denite
predictions for physical quantities, many ambiguities appear[7,8]: consistent ultra-violet
cuto methods, vacuum energy subtraction, and boundary conditions at innity being
only some of the examples. these questions must be settled if we want the method to
yield a denite nite result.

the present paper is intended to complement the earlier works on soliton quantization
in the following three aspects. first, the approach that we develop naturally unies the
classical image of a soliton as a solitary wave and the fundamental quantum-mechanical
principles. it makes a simple connection with such more formal views on this problem as
the collective quantization methods[4,5] and the form-factor, kerman-klein, approach
applied to solitons in the goldstone and jackiw paper[2]. this is demonstrated in sec-
tions 2-4, where we review the basics of collective quantization (sec. 2), then introduce
our variational scheme (sec. 3), and draw parallels to the kerman-klein method for
calculating the soliton form-factor (sec. 4).

second, during this work we have had in mind to construct a calculational method
for soliton parameters which can be practically implemented as a computer algorithm.
it then could be applied to analyze the quantum eects in theories that are too compli-
cated for analytical solution, but from qualitative considerations[9] may possibly possess
non-trivial stable solitonic states. much progress in this direction has already been
achieved[7,10] in the last couple of years. however, the developed numerical methods for
calculation of quantum corrections would not be fully satisfactory without understand-
ing of the special role played in the system description by the cyclic variables, such as the
soliton position in space. we discuss the relative signicance of the modications needed
to incorporate the cyclic variables (secs. 3, 6.2) and show on a simple example of a one
dimensional kink (secs. 6.1, 6.2) how to calculate the one-loop quantum corrections to
the physical parameters characterizing the soliton in its true, delocalized, ground state.

third, we discuss theory regularization in the solitonic sector remembering that
renormalization conditions are conventionally imposed in the perturbative sector of the

2

theory (sec. 5). in dealing with this subtle issue, we prefer to apply physically realizable
regularization methods rather than formal manipulations with divergent expressions.
our nal formulas involve only nite quantities and convergent integrals, suitable for
the numerical computations of section 6. a summary and conclusions are given at the
end of the paper (sec. 7).

2 collective quantization

we assume that the theory has an absolutely stable solitonic state. that is, the decay
of this soliton into plane-wave excitations over the usual vacuum is forbidden by con-
servation of some charge q, which could be a topological charge or a fermion number.
dierent values of the charge q split the overall hilbert space of the theory into sepa-
rate non-mixing sectors with their own ground states, which would be the true vacuum
for the perturbative sector and the soliton at rest for the solitonic sector. due to
translational invariance of the theory, the total momentum operator p commutes with
the hamiltonian,

[ p, h] = 0 ,

and the lowest energy state in the solitonic sector should also be an eigenstate of the
momentum operator, corresponding to the total momentum zero. by the heisenberg
uncertainty principle, the position of the soliton in space is completely undened. the
techniques to handle this situation are known[16].

to be specic, we illustrate the formalism on the simplest example of a real scalar

eld  in one space dimension with the lagrangian density

l(x, t) =

1

t!2
2   



1

x!2
2   

 g2 u(g) .

(2.1)

this theory may support a stable topological soliton if the global minimum of the po-
tential u is not unique:

 1, 2 :

u(1) = u(2) = min u ,

1 6= 2

(we assume that the minima 1 and 2 are connected by a discrete symmetry of the
lagrangian (2.1), e.g.   .) let (x) be an arbitrary function such that

lim
x

(x) = 1 ,

lim

let also {k(x)} be a set of orthonormal functions,
z dx k(x) l(x) = kl ,

(x) = 2 .

(2.2)

3

that are orthogonal to (x),

and, together with (x), form a complete set.

z dx (x) k(x) = 0 ,

following the christ and lee method[4], we describe the solitonic sector of the theory
trading the eld (x) for an equivalent set of commuting dynamical variables { x, q1, q2, ...}
as

(x) = g1(x  x) +



xk=1

qkk(x  x) .

(2.3)

given a eld conguration (x), the corresponding variables {x, q1, q2, ...} may be de-
termined from the equations

z dx (x  x)(x) = 0 ,
qk = z dx k(x  x)h(x)  g1(x  x)i .

(2.4)

(2.5)

let { p , 1, 2, ...} be the operators of the canonical momenta conjugate to { x, q1, q2, ...},
so that

[ p , x] = i ,

[k, ql] = ikl

with all other possible commutators being zero. the original hamiltonian,

with

h[(x), (x)] =

1

2 z dx ((x))2 + v [ ]

v []  z dx(cid:20) 1

2

((x))2 + g2 u(g(x))(cid:21) ,

(2.6)

(2.7)

when being re-expressed in terms of the new variables and their conjugate momenta,
reads[4,11]:

h( p , , q) =

1
2



xk=1

k + v (q) + g2h( p , , q) .
2

(2.8)

in this expression h( p , , q) is an o(g2) correction to the kinetic term that is quadratic
in the canonical momenta p or , but has somewhat intricate q-dependence[4], and v (q)
is simply the potential term (2.7) written in terms of the new variables.

the hamiltonian (2.8) does not depend on the collective coordinate x to any order
in the coupling g reecting the system invariance to translation of the eld (x) in space

4

as a whole. its conjugate momentum p is, therefore, a conserved quantity:

[ p , h] = 0 .

it is possible to show[4,11] that the operator p indeed represents the total momentum
of the system1. the essence of the collective quantization is to describe the original
theory restricted to the subspace of the quantum states |pi that carry a denite total
momentum p , for example

p |0i = 0 .

the zero value of the momentum can always be achieved by a proper choice of the
lorentz frame2. in the p = 0 sector the full hamiltonian (2.8) reduces to

h(, q) =

1
2



xk=1

2
k + v (q) + o(g2) ,

(2.9)

and the remaining dynamical variables may be handled by conventional perturbative or
semi-classical methods.

we would like to conclude this section by the following remark: in the original christ
and lee method the prole function g1(x) in eq. (2.3) is required to satisfy the classical
eld equations of motion. in the present discussion, (x) is an arbitrary function with
the proper asymptotic behavior, eq. (2.2), yielding a non-degenerate transformation
(x)  {x, q1, q2, ...} . we exploit this freedom in the choice of  soon.

3 reduced eective energy

for the solitonic sector of the theory and a given function (x) in the canonical trans-
formation (2.3), we dene

xk=1z dt jk(t)qk(t)! ,

1 let us provide a simple illustration of this statement observing that the commutation relations

[ p , qk] = 0

and [ p , f ( x)] = if ( x)  function f (x)

being applied to eq. (2.3) produce immediately the formula for the total momentum commutator:

[ p , (x)] = i


x

(x) .

2 quantization in moving frames may also be considered[12].

5

where s[q] s[q1(t), q2(t), ...] in eq. (3.1) is the classical action of our system in the
p = 0 sector corresponding to the reduced hamiltonian (2.9), and the functional mea-
sure [dq] = qk=1[dqk] absorbs all the factors that may have appeared in the functional

integral when the canonical momenta k were integrated out. eqs. (3.1) and (3.2) are
reminiscent of the standard denitions of the generating functional w [j(x)] and the

eective action [0(x)], when the source terms would have the form r d2x j(x)(x).

here, we couple the sources jk to the complicated non-linear functionals qk[(x)]. we
refer the quantity  as the reduced eective action.

let us consider the special case when the arguments of  are constant functions
q1, q2, ... , and let the time integrals in eqs. (3.13.2) be taken over a large but nite
interval 0  t t . then

[q1(t), q2(t), ...] = ee(q1, q2, ...) t ,

where the reduced eective energy ee allows a nice physical interpretation[13]. namely,
it is the minimum of the hamiltonian expectation value among the quantum states |i
for which the quantum expectation values of the operators {qk} are given by ee argu-
ments, {qk}:

ee(q1, q2, ...) = min

|i such that
h| qk |i=qk

h| h|i
h|i

.

(3.3)

we primed the ket-vectors |i in order to emphasize that these states belong to the
hilbert space associated with the reduced hamiltonian h. it is dierent from the space
of the states, {|i}, of the original theory described by h because the latter carry an
additional quantum number  the total momentum p . however, by construction

and one can rewrite eq. (3.3) in terms of the objects of the original theory:

h(, q) = h( p , , q)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) p =0

,

ee(q1, q2, ...) =

min

|i such that

h| qk |i=qk , p |i=0

h| h|i
h|i

.

provided that we are able to compute the reduced eective energy ee , the mass of the
soliton in its ground state, m, may be determined as

m = min
q1,q2,...

ee(q1, q2, ...) = min

|i such that

p |i=0

h| h|i
h|i

.

(3.4)

now we proceed to the actual computation of ee . our rst crucial step is to trade
the discrete innite set of variables {q1, q2, ...} for a more physically intuitive continuous

6

shape function. as eq. (3.4) suggests, the mass of the soliton, in principle, could be
calculated by searching for the minimum of ee over the range of parameters {q1, q2, ...}
that are dened by means of the decomposition (2.3) with an arbitrarily chosen but xed
function (x). however, we nd it more straightforward to always calculate ee at zero
expectation values of all qk and vary the function (x) itself looking for the soliton mass
as

m = min
(x)

ee[(x)] .

(3.5)

in this equation, ee[(x)] is ee(0, 0, ...), by our previous notations, where the coordi-
nates {qk} are dened using the given shape function (x). as shown in section 4, the
conguration (x) that minimizes the right hand side of eq. (3.5) is closely connected
to the soliton form factor.

the semi-classical expansion for the reduced eective energy

ee[(x)] = ecl[(x)] + ecas[(x)] + o(g)

(3.6)

starts from an o(g2) term  the classical energy associated with the eld conguration

one of the several methods to prove this statement consists in modifying the kinetic
term in the stabilized reduced hamiltonian (3.10) by addition of the p -dependent
piece g2h(p, , q) that appears in eq. (2.8). then we transform the canonical variables
back to the continuous elds (x) and (x), when eq. (2.5) comes helpful. as the result

where h[(x), (x)] is the hamiltonian of the original theory (2.6) and the second term
in eq. (3.14) is the transform of the stabilizing term from the previous expression. the
non-linear, non-local functional x[(x)] in eq. (3.14) is explicitly dened by eq. (2.4) and
the source j(x) is precisely the one that appears in eq. (3.12). it is not hard to argue
that the modication (3.13) does not aect the spectrum of small oscillations about the
classical equilibrium point of this system more than o(g2), although it implies an addi-
tional degree of freedom associated with the momentum p and the oscillation spectrum
of h[(x), (x)] should acquire an additional eigen-mode. however, the new canonical
variable ,x, does not explicitly enter h as it was not present in the previous expres-
sion (3.13), leaving the hamiltonian (3.14) still being invariant under (x)  (x + a) ,
and the eigen-frequency of the new, translational, mode being identically zero for any
conguration (x). finally, the oscillation spectrum of h is determined by the eigen-
value problem

that after some algebra leads to eq. (3.11) above.

to summarize, the one-loop contribution to the eective energy in the p = 0 sector
is given by the sum3 of 1
2 n[] that are determined by the schroedinger-type equa-
tion (3.11) with a non-local but separable potential. this sum is terribly divergent and
should be regularized by subtracting the casimir energy of the trivial vacuum and proper
counterterms specied by renormalization conditions in the perturbative sector. we per-
form this regularization in section 5. in the absence of the non-local terms in eq. (3.11),
the sum of the corresponding eigen-modes, including 0, would yield the one-loop con-
tribution to the conventional eective energy associated with the spatially nailed down
eld conguration (x) = g1(x). the non-local terms vanish for (x) = cl(x)  g cl(x)
that solves the classical euler-lagrange equation,

d2cl
dx2  u(cl) = 0 ,

(3.15)

because then jcl(x)  0 by its denition (3.12). these terms guarantee that eq. (3.11)
allows a normalizable zero-frequency solution 0(x)  (x) even when (x) diers from
the classical conguration. however, the eect of the non-local terms on the frequencies
with n6= 0 is only quadratic in     cl . indeed, calculating   [] [cl] by
the usual perturbation theory, we see these terms do not contribute in the rst order
because jcl  0 and r dz n = 0 when n6= 0.

minimizing the reduced eective energy (3.6) with respect to all possible congura-
tions (x) one nds the mass of the soliton, m . a consistent approximation scheme for
this procedure can be implemented as a power series in the coupling g that starts from

mcl = min ecl = ecl[cl] = o(g2) .

the next, casimir, term modies the mass by

m = ecas[cl] = o(g0) .

(3.16)

(3.17)

since, in general,

6= 0 ,

the casimir term in ee also changes the minimizing conguration, or the soliton form
factor, by o(g2). however, according to the previous paragraph, the non-local potential
in eq. (3.11) does not aect the quantity (3.16) or the sum in eq. (3.17). we conclude
that for the purpose of calculating the rst quantum correction to the classical values
of the soliton mass and form factor it is sucient to sum up the oscillation frequencies

n about a spatially xed conguration (x), omitting the non-local terms in eq. (3.11),
but throw away the lowest eigen-frequency, 0 .

nevertheless, eqs. (3.8, 3.11) allow one to compute the well dened one loop eective
energy in the p = 0 sector for the congurations not necessarily close to the solution of
the classical equations of motion. this can be helpful in the search for non-perturbative
radiatively generated solitons[15], at least on the qualitative level. therefore, in our
calculational example in section 6 we exploit the full form of eq. (3.11) including all the
non-local terms.

4 shape function and the soliton form factor

in this short section we demonstrate that, to our one-loop accuracy, the function (x)
minimizing the functional ee[] has a physical interpretation of the soliton form-factor.
indeed, let us evaluate the matrix element of the operator (x) between the stable
solitonic states with the mass m that dier by their total momenta:

hp | (x)|pi = ei(p p )xhp | (0)|pi .

(4.1)

first, we present the state |pi as the soliton at rest, |0i4, boosted to the momentum p
by the lorentz boost operator p and recall the scalar nature of the eld (x). we have

hp | (0)|pi = hp | (0)p|0i = hp |p (0)|0i = hq| (0)|0i = f (q) ,

where

describes a soliton carrying the momentum

|qi = p|p i = p|p i

q =

p e  p e

m

= (p   p ) 

p p 
2m 2 (p   p ) + ... = p   p + o(g4) .

for the very last estimate, we remember that m = o(g2) and that we are interested in
the momenta p and p  of the order of the inverse soliton size that is o(g0) .

second, we substitute (x) by the decomposition (2.3) and fourier transform the

functions (x) and (x):

f (q)  hq| (0)|0i = g1hq|( x) + g qkk( x)|0i =

2 hq|eiq x [(q) + g qk k(q)]|0i .
4 the state |0i should not be confused with the true, perturbative, vacuum.

= g1z dq

(4.2)

10

third, let us notice that the state eiq x|qi, being a momentum eigenstate because

p (cid:16)eiq x|qi(cid:17) = eiq x( p  q)|qi = (q  q)(cid:16)eiq x|qi(cid:17) ,

is also almost an eigenstate of the hamiltonian (2.8) :

h(cid:16)eiq x|qi(cid:17) = eiq x h|qi + [ h, eiq x]|qi = m (cid:16)eiq x|qi(cid:17) + o(g2)|qi .

from these two observations we conclude that

eiq x|qi = (cid:16)1 + o(g4)(cid:17)|q  qi + o(g2)|(q  q)i ,

(4.3)

where |(q  q)i describes an excited soliton or a soliton-meson scattering state with
the total momentum q q . the leading term in eq. (4.3) is, of course, expected to be
the same soliton boosted to the momentum q q for a heavy, non-relativistic particle
described by the operators x and p . the higher order corrections should be anticipated
as well because eip x is not the complete boost operator in the eld theory.

substituting the result (4.3) in eq. (4.2) and applying the normalization conditions5

hq  q|0i = 2 (q  q) ,
hq  q|qk|0i = 0 ,

one arrives at the formula

f (q) = g1n(q) + o(g3)o .

summarizing eqs. (4.14.6),

g hp | (x)|pi = ei(p p )x(cid:16)(p   p ) + o(g3)(cid:17) =
= z dy ei(p p )y(x  y) + o(g3) ,

(4.8)

which is the ansatz (ii) of goldstone and jackiw[2] corrected for the one-loop quantum
eects. in the perturbative expansion about the classical conguration,

(x) = cl(x) + (x) ,

(4.9)

5 the normalization in eq. (4.4) is taken to agree with the paper [2]. the second equation holds
automatically for the forward matrix element, h0|qk|0i, by our choice of the conguration (x) that keeps
the expectation values of qs at zero (see the text around eq. (3.5)). for the o-forward matrix elements,

hq  q|qk|0i =

1

q  q hq  q|[ p , qk]|0i = 0 ,

q  q 6= 0 .

11

we obtain the following linear equation for the leading order correction  that minimizes
the sum ecl + ecas:

"

dx2 + u(cl(x))# (x) = g2 
xk=1

u (cl(x)) 2
4 k[cl]

k(x)

+ o(g3) .

(4.10)

this is the formula for the one-loop correction to the soliton form-factor derived within
the kerman-klein method[2]. the non-local terms in eq. (3.11) take care of the (would
be innite) zero-mode term on the right hand side of eq. (4.10) but give no other con-
tribution in this order of the perturbative expansion (4.9), as it was already stated at
the end of section 3.

5 regularization

now we return to the main line of our discussion and consider the reduced casimir
energy, currently written in the form (3.8). the aim of this section is to convert this
formal expression into an unambiguous and nite quantity calculable numerically with
our computer. to avoid the many possible pitfalls in this step, we attempt to be very
explicit in details. first of all, in order to regulate the k[] sum in eq. (3.8), one
should subtract the casimir energy of the true, perturbative, vacuum. for the scalar
eld (x) living in a box of length l with xed  values at the boundaries, the normal
oscillation modes (meson excitations) about the topologically trivial minimum energy
conguration (x)  g11 (or 2) have the frequency
!2

n = 0, 1, . . . .

n = qm2 + k2

,

each of the sums p k[] and p (0)

n diverges badly and one should specify an ultra-
violet cuto prescription. it must be imposed consistently in both the trivial and the
solitonic sectors6. this is not straightforward to achieve because of many incongruities
between both the system description and its spectrum in the two sectors.

let us keep in mind that the ultra-violet divergences are unambiguously regularized
by replacement of the continuous eld (x) with a large but nite number of degrees
of freedom having the same low-energy behavior, as provided, for example, by a lattice
version of the theory. we imagine a continuous and physically realizable process that
adiabatically transfers the regularized (quantum!)
system from the vacuum state to

6 it would be dangerous, and actually wrong in one space dimension, to cut o the oscillation modes
at some xed energy which is the same in both sectors because the number of modes below the cuto
in these sectors generally diers.

that smoothly interpolate between the trivial and non-trivial topologies as the parameter
s varies from 1 to 1. we would like to examine the behavior of the classical oscillation
frequencies and the quantum casimir energy in the ground state of this system as a func-
tion of s. the classical time-independent eld equation (3.15) with the potential (5.2)
admits the solutions

 a = const .

(5.4)

as the constant a in eq. (5.4) varies from minus innity to l/2 , (l) stays exponentially,
i.e. up to o(el), close to one, whereas (0) goes from 1 to 1 + o(el), as illustrated
by fig. 1. therefore, up to unessential exponentially small corrections, we can satisfy
the boundary conditions (5.3) by the solutions (5.4) where the parameter a is taken to
be the following function of s:

a = ln(cid:18)1  s

1 + s(cid:19) .

(5.5)

when the variation in s drives the system from the trivial sector to the topological
 1 to

one, the lowest of the normal frequencies (5.1) decreases from (0)

an innitesimal value for l. the zero point oscillations in the lowest normal mode
become more and more broad until the quantum ground state of the system completely
de-localizes. by this moment, the quasi-classical description of the corresponding normal
coordinate breaks down, and it should be replaced by the collective quantization as
s 1. the other oscillation modes retain nite positive frequencies and their quasi-
classical description holds all the time. thus the rst-order quantum correction to the
soliton mass, m, may be determined as the sum of the shifts 1
for
the k  1 modes minus half of the frequency of the disappeared lowest vacuum mode.
this is evident from the requirement of having an equal number of degrees of freedom,
whether collectively quantized or not, in both sectors of the regularized theory. for
notational convenience, let us dene 0  0  (0)
0 where 0  0 corresponds to the
zero eigenvalue of eq. (3.11), so that

in this equation c.t. stands for the counter terms contribution due to one-loop renor-
malization of parameters in the theory. we will return to it shortly.

by now, regularization of ecas[] should become apparent. indeed, from the phys-
ical interpretation of the reduced eective energy, eq. (3.5), we conclude that at its
minimum, 0,

ecas[0] = m1loop =

(5.6)

since all the vacuum subtractions needed to regulate ecas[], together with the unphys-
ical 0[] 0, do not depend on the function (x) and we determined them for some
particular conguration 0(x), they simply carry over to an arbitrary (x) in the same

let us assume for simplicity that the lagrangian (2.1) is invariant under the  
transformation and take 1 = 2 for the (x) boundary conditions (2.2). then it is
sucient to consider only the congurations (x) that are odd functions of x so that the
eigen-functions n(x) in eq. (3.11) are either even or odd. of course, now we imply that
our regularization methods also respect parity, for example, the coordinate x varies from
l to l, where l 1

the integral in eq. (5.9) is a poor approximation when k  l1 but because for such
modes8  = o(l2) and their number is o(l0), we can safely set the lower limit of
dk integration to zero, provided the integral converges in the infra-red.

since the scattering phases 


fall o as 1/k for large momenta, the integral in
eq. (5.10) still diverges logarithmically on the upper limit. this ultra-violet divergence
is removed by the usual parameter renormalization that manifests itself in the form of
the counter term in eq. (5.10). let us remember that counterterms are conventionally
dened by a certain renormalization condition in the perturbative sector of the theory
independently of the collective quantization procedure. by translational invariance, the
corresponding term in the action, for instance,

s(4)

c.t.  z d2xh2(x)  1i

(5.11)

in the 4 theory, can not depend on the collective coordinate x. the total momentum
p is also g-suppressed in sc.t.[], as in eq. (2.8), or does not appear at all in the absence
of wave function renormalization that is the case in our example (5.11). therefore,
sc.t. = sc.t.[q] simply modies the potential v [q] in eq. (2.8), and for the purpose of
obtaining the explicit form of the counterterm contribution to the reduced eective
energy, we may ignore the reduction to the p = 0 sector and consider the conventional

8unless the state becomes bound when it is counted separately.

= i tr ln(cid:16)2  m2  v(cid:17) ,

v(g(x))  u (g(x))  m2 ,

(5.12)

where again m2 stands for the value of u at its minimum and describes the mass of
the perturbative plane wave excitations over the true vacuum. denoting the operator
(2  m2) by 0, we have the following expansion in powers of the interaction v():
(5.13)

1loop[] = i tr ln 0  i tr(cid:16)1

0 v(cid:17)  i tr(cid:16)1

0 v1

0 v(cid:17)  . . . .

the rst term in this expansion is a constant independent of the eld conguration 
that is trivially removed by setting the vacuum energy to zero. the rest of the terms
may be presented graphically by the sum of the diagrams shown on fig. 2. the inclusion
of c.t.[] =sc.t.[] should remove all the divergences from the loop integrals on fig. 2.
for a scalar eld in one dimension this can be achieved[7] by modifying the scattering
phases in eq. (5.10) as

9 this trick works because the consecutive born approximations for eq. (5.14) and the expan-
sion (5.13) are formulated as a power series of same quantity, v . similar methods can be carried out
for suciently general theories of bosonic or fermionic elds in the realistic three space dimensions[16].

16

this operation is equivalent to adding a counter term that cancels the shift of the eld
vacuum expectation value in the perturbative sector due to one-loop corrections. the

it should be reassuring that the non-local separable potential in eq. (3.11) does not aect
the 1/k asymptotic behavior of

integral in eq. (5.15).

as a demonstration of our method, we calculate the reduced eective energy for a set
of eld congurations in the one-dimensional 4 example

we exploit two dierent families of trial congurations. the rst one is the scaling

transformation of the classical kink solution (5.4):

i(x)  g(x) = tanh

x
2w

.

(6.2)

the parameter w characterizes the width of the kink (6.2) relative to its classical value.
as it is seen from further calculations, the scaling transformation (6.2) possesses some
unexpected peculiar properties. for this reason we also consider an alternative variation
of the solution (5.4) constructed to represent some absolutely non-special direction in
the functional space of all admissible variations:

ii(x) = tanh

(6.4)

according to the previous sections, the reduced casimir energy is determined by
eqs. (5.15-5.16) where the discrete oscillation mode frequencies, n, and the scattering
phases in the continuous spectrum, 
(k), refer to the solutions of the auxiliary eq. (3.11).

the following subsection 6.1 describes how to actually solve these non-local equations
and extract the required quantities n and 
(k). the reader who is not interested in

these details should skip to subsection 6.2 where we analyze our numerical results.

6.1 practical implementation

substituting the explicit form of the potential u, eq. (5.2), let us rewrite eq. (3.11) as
(6.5)

 (x) + v(x)(x) + ai(x)z +



dy bi(y) (y) = (cid:16)2  1(cid:17) (x) ,

where we sum over the repeated index i = 1, 2 and dene

v(x)  u((x))  1 =

with i  r dz ()2 , ij  r dz (j) .
if the conguration (x) is an odd function of x, which is true in our cases (6.2, 6.3),
the functions v(x), ai(x), and bi(x) are even and the modes {(x)} divide into the parity
even (symmetric) and odd (antisymmetric) channels. the separable potential term in
eq. (6.5) does not appear in the antisymmetric channel because the integral over dy
trivially vanishes for the odd (y). changing the lower integration limit to zero in the
symmetric channel, we reformulate the problem (6.5) as:




k+(x) + 2ai(x)r +0

with +(0) = 0

dy bi(y) +(y) = 0

k(x) = 0
with (0) = 0




18

(symmetric channel) ,

(6.7)

(antisymmetric channel)

(6.8)

where k is the local linear dierential operator

k = 

d2
dx2 + v(x)  (2  1) .

first, let us determine the discrete spectrum, formed by the solutions with  < 1
that exponentially vanish as x + . in the antisymmetric channel we simply integrate
the dierential equation (6.8) from 0 to + with initial conditions (0) = 0, 
(0) = 1
and search for s for which (x) falls o exponentially at large x . of course, this has
to be repeated for every conguration (x).

in the symmetric channel, eq. (6.7), we can also apply this shooting technique looking

for the solutions in the form

+(x) = 0(x) + ii(x) ,

(6.9)

where we sum over i = 1, 2 . in this ansatz 0, 1, and 2 solve the ordinary dierential
equations

kq(x)  q (x) + v(x)q(x)  (2  1)q(x) = 


with the boundary conditions

0

aq(x)

for q = 0

for q  i = 1, 2

0(0) = 1 , 0(0) = 0 ;

i(0) , i(0) = 0 .

substituting the ansatz (6.9) into eq. (6.7) we see that the latter holds provided the
coecients 1 and 2 are determined from the following linear algebraic equation:

i + i + ij j = 0 ,

(6.10)

where again i and j range over 1 and 2, and

i  2z +

0

dy bi(y) 0(y) , ij  2z +

0

dy bi(y) j(y) .

the outcome of the described procedure applied to our rst family of the trial congura-
tions, eq. (6.2), in both symmetric and antisymmetric channels is presented on fig. 3 a)
(solid lines). we would like to postpone its discussion until the following subsection.

in the continuous spectrum of the symmetric channel we look for the solution of

eq. (6.7) in the form

+(x) = ei

+(k)(x) + ei

+(k)(x)

19

where (x) is a formal solution of eq. (6.7) for x  [0, +) such that

(x)  eikx

as x  + ,

and the scattering phase +(k) is adjusted to satisfy the condition

+(0) = 0 .

(6.11)

in order to achieve better numerical precision, we trade the oscillating function (x) for
a smoother one, c(x), as

(x) = c(x)eikx

with

c(+) = 1 and c(+) = 0

(we remember that k 2  1 and c(x) depends on the parameter k as well). the

function c(x) also satises a linear dierential equation with a separable potential,

 c(x)  2ikc(x) + v(x)c(x) + 2 eikxai(x)z +

0

dy bi(y)eikyc(y) = 0 ,

and is determined, just as in the case of eq. (6.7), with the ansatz

c(x) = c0(x) + ici(x) ,

(6.12)

where

 cq (x)  2ikcq(x) + v(x)cq(x) = 

ci(+) , ci(+) = 0 .

c0(+) = 1 , c0(+) = 0 ;

aq(x) eikx

0

for q = 0 ,
for q = 1, 2 ;

again, we have the algebraic equation i + i + ij j = 0 for the coecients 1 and 2
where

i = 2z +

0

dy bi(y)eiky c0(y) , ij = 2z +

0

dy bi(y)eiky cj(y) .

having calculated the function c(x), we nd the phase +(k) from the condition (6.11)
as

+ =  arg [k c(0)  ic(0)] ,

where the branch of the argument functions is unambiguously specied by the require-
ment limk + = 0 .

the spectrum of small oscillations about the classical kink solution cl = tanh x
of the continuous spectrum with  = 1 + k2, a parity odd discrete state at  =

and the even 0 = 0 translational mode. besides, the parity even amplitude +(x) cor-
responding to + = 1 approaches a constant value as x. innitesimally lowering
the frequency with an arbitrarily small variation of the soliton shape, one would send
this state into the discrete spectrum. it is often convenient to refer such a state as a
half-bound one.

d(w)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)w = 0

a small variation of the shape function induces a shift in the oscillation frequencies
and the total casimir energy.
in general, the shifts are expected to be linear in the
variational parameters, w = w  1 or  in our examples (6.2) or (6.3), of course, up to
less important in the perturbative regime higher power corrections. the non-vanishing of
is clearly visible for the odd discrete state on fig. 3 a) and for the continuous
contribution to the casimir energy on fig. 3 b), where the ansatz (6.2) was considered.
the dashed lines on this figure present the same quantities computed for a localized kink
conguration[7,10], when the non-local terms in eq. (3.11) are absent. the discrepancy
between the two methods for the non-zero modes is barely observable, demonstrating
the weakness of the collective quantization inuence on these modes in the perturbative
regime.

as expected, there always exists a normalizable zero-frequency solution in the sym-
metric channel of the reduced problem (3.11). for a localized conguration, the zero-

mode frequency would vary as 0 1  w and become imaginary as w exceeds 1 . this

square root singularity and the imaginary contribution to the conventional eective en-
ergy has nothing to do with the soliton instability (it is stable!).
it is rather due to
inadequacy of the standard eective energy formalism in describing the true solitonic
ground state that has no specied position in space.

the wide solid line on fig. 3 b) is our nal result for ecas verses the kink width. the

rst perturbative correction to the soliton mass[1,17,10],

m1loop = e()

cas(0) =

1
43 

3
2  0.333127 ,

(6.13)

is numerically found to be 0.333124, which, given our numerical accuracy, is in com-
plete agreement with the analytical result (6.13). surprisingly, the plot on fig. 3 b)
shows no apparent dependence of ecas on the width w. indeed, in table 1 we give the
deviations of numerically computed contributions to ecas from their classical values for
the antisymmetric discrete mode 
(w), which coincides with (w), and for the sum

of the continuous modes, e(cont)
obtained for a
localized soliton and the correction to it due to collective quantization. as one can see
from the table, the linear variation in the discrete spectrum exactly cancels by the local
part of the continuous spectrum and one is left with the quadratic in w dependence,

7 conclusion

to summarize, we adapted the conventional eective energy variational techniques to
the situation where the hamiltonian of the system possesses cyclic variables and the
standard semi-classical methods should incorporate their collective quantization.
in
our formalism one may retain the description of the system in terms of a continuous
eld, (x), by introducing an external source with a special non-linear non-local cou-
pling. the source term in eq. (3.14) insures the coupling to all the normal degrees of
freedom excluding the cyclic variables. the eective energy functional reduced to the
p = 0 sector of solitonic states, ee[(x)], is given to rst order in h by the classical en-
ergy of the conguration (x) = g1(x) and the properly regularized reduced casimir
energy, eq. (5.15). the mass of the soliton in the ground state equals the minimum
of ee[], and the conguration (x) at which this minimum is achieved describes the
soliton form-factor, eq. (4.8).

the eect of collective quantization technically amounts to the introduction of the
non-local separable potential10 in the eigen-mode equation (3.11). however, in order
to obtain the rst quantum corrections to the classical values of the soliton mass and
form-factor, one could ignore these non-local terms but follow the rule that the lowest
oscillation eigen-frequency must be excluded from the casimir energy. the correction to
the reduced energy due to collective quantization grows quadratically with the deviation
from the classical eld conguration. to get a possible insight into the physics in the
non-perturbative regime, one may still consider ee[(x)] computed only to the one-loop
order. this can be done numerically for an arbitrary eld conguration as described in
section 5.

it would be interesting to apply this method to investigation of the role of collective
quantization in deeply non-perturbative regime. this could be necessary, for example,
for a consistent treatment of the models[19] in which a non-classical eld conguration is
stabilized by an order h contribution to the soliton energy from fermionic elds coupled
to the scalar higgs. an extension of the method that would incorporate the fermionic
elds as well, presents another challenge by itself.

10 some aspects of the casimir energy for systems described by separable potentials has been con-

sidered by jae and williamson[18].
