(cid:3) lemma 2. let -twisted kms functional (a , ). positive, = id e ordinary positive kms functional (m , e). proof. positive coincides modulus associated partial isometry u satises u = . shall show next separating m. let u(t) = eiht oneparameter unitary group implementing et, cf. relation (3), let v unitary operator implementing e. according lemma 1, functional e etwisted positive kms functional (m , e). x x = 0, also et(x) = 0, hence, making use formula (1), x = 0 e(e(y)et(x)) = (e(y)et(x), ) = 0 e(xy) = 0 (y, x) = 0 x = 0 . (6) thus x = 0 zx = 0 xz = 0 z m, hence x = 0. immediate consequence observation u = 1. remains show e = id. let oneparameter modular group associated . u(s)invariant es(m) = m, unitary groups u(s) commute. thus exists dense subalgebra m0 m0 core eh. kms property modular group (x, ) = (yx, ) = (xy, ) = (y, x) , x, m0 .

(cid:3) let us assume e 2 = id. note always case twisted kms functional selfadjoint, i.e. (a) = (a), a. e(ua) = (a) = (a) = e(ua) = e(au) = e(ua), (17) last equality made use fact e kms functional et(u) = u. thus u = u since e faithful, hence e 2 = ad u2 = id. twisted kms functional called graded kms functional e latter property. given graded kmsfunctional (a, ), let man weakly dense algebra eanalytic elements let , e0 dtet|t=0 (18) (19) (20) generator e, man core. dynamical system (a, ) said supersymmetric exists closable odd derivation e : man man odd derivation mean graded derivation, i.e. e 2(a) = e0(a) , man . e(ab) = e(a)b + e(a)e(b) , a, b man , odd, i.e. e e = e e man. note condition supersymmetry cdynamical system somewhat weaker condition supersymmetry since existence supersymmetry transformations required repre- sentation induced . corollary 8. let graded kms functional supersymmetric cdynam- ical system (a, ). exists asymptotically abelian sequence n aut a, e = 0, e = id, e trace. proof. proposition 7, e ordinary kms functional grading e trivial. since e odd, follows e = e = 0 man, hence e0 = 0 equation (19) fact man core e0. thus e = id, hence kms property conclude e trace m.
