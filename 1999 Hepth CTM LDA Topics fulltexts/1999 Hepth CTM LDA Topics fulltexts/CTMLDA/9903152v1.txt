1 introduction

it is a well known fact that one of the most important symmetries of string theories, or in
general -models, is target-space, t-duality. there was a common belief among the experts in
this eld that the existence of t-duality mainly should depend on the isometry symmerty of the
original target manifold such that, depending on the kind of isometry it was called abelian or
non-abelian t-duality (for a review see [1]). of course there were some diculties in the non-
abelian case, for example it was not possible to obtain the original model from the dual one,
because the latter might not have isometry [2]. indeed klimcik and severa, by introducing the
poisson-lie t-duality in their pioneering work [3], could remove the requirement of isometry
in obtaining the dual model. hence they could remove the above mentioned diculties in
t-duality investigation.
indeed, poisson-lie duality does not require the isometry in the
original target manifold; the integrability of the noethers current associated with the action
of group g on the target manifold is good enough to have this symmetry.
in other words,
the components of the noethers current play the role of at connection, that is, they satisfy
maurer-cartan equations with group structure of g (with the same dimension as g) [3];
such that g and g have poisson-lie structure and their lie algebras form a bialgebra [4, 5].
classically the dual models are equivalent, since one can obtain one from the other through
a canonical transformation in their respective phase space. this canonical equivalence has
already been shown, both in poisson-lie t-duality [3, 6, 7] and abelian or non-abelian t-
duality [8]. actually, the quantum equivalence of both abelian and non-abelian dual models
have already been investigated. this equivalence can be shown by obtaining a general relation
between the weyl-anomaly coecients (and -functions) of the original model and those of its
dual [9, 10]. but the quantum equivalence of the poisson-lie dual models is still a challenging
problem; the quantum equivalence has been shown only in some special examples [10, 11].
therefore, in order to understand the quantum features of the poisson-lie t-duality we have a
long way ahead. hence, we need to investigate too many -models with poisson-lie symmetry,
since so far few examples with poisson-lie symmetry have been obtained [3, 10, 11, 12]. this
suggests us trying to nd further examples with poisson-lie symmetry. in this paper, we nd
explicitly all possible dual algebras of all three dimensional real lie algebras (bianchi algebras).
then by introducing a non-degenerate adjoint invariant inner product over the lie algebras of
drinfeld doubles, we nd many bialgebras, where we have associated a pair of poisson-lie dual
-models to each of these bialgebras which contain all examples mentioned above and many
other examples. this paper is organized as follows. in order the paper to be self-contained
and also to x the notations, we give a brief review of the poisson-lie t-duality in section
2.
in section 3 we obtain all possible dual algebras of each of bianchi algebras, where the
bialgebras thus obtained have been listed in table 2. then, we introduce a non-degenerate
adjoint invariant inner product over (six dimensional) lie algebras of drinfeld doubles, such
that each of bialgebras are isotropic with respect to this inner product. in section 4 some of
the general formulas related to the calculation of coupling matrices of -models, associated
with the bialgebras of table 2, have been constructed. actually these informations help us to
write a pair of poisson-lie dual -models associated with each bialgebra of table 2. at the end
of this section we give two simple examples. finally, the paper ends with a brief conclusion
and two appendices.

2 poisson-lie t-duality

in this section we review briey the poisson-lie t-duality. according to [3] the poisson-lie
duality based on the concepts of drinfeld double and manin triple. drinfeld double d is a lie
group where its lie algebra d can be decomposed (as a vector space) into direct sum of two
lie subalgebras g and g, such that this is maximal isotropic with respect to a non-degenerate
invariant bilinear form <, > over d. the doublet (g, g) and triplet (d, g, g) are called bialgebra
and manin triple respectively [4, 5]. actually taking the sets {xi} and { x i} as the bases of
the lie algebras g and g, respectively, we have:

[xi, xj] = fij

kxk,

[ x i, x j] = f ij

k

x k,

[xi, x j] = f jk

ixk + fki

j x k.

the isotropy of the subalgebras with respect to bilinear form means that:

< xi, xj >=< x i, x j >= 0,

< xi, x j >= i

j.

(1)

(2)

also, the jacobi identity of lie algebra d imposes the following relations over the structure
constants of lie algebras g and g [3, 5]:

fmk

i f jm

l  fml

i f jm

k  fmk

j f im

l + fml

j f im

k = fkl

m f ij

m.

(3)

as we will see in the next section the above relations put rather strong constraint on the
structure constants of subalgebras. hence, obtaining of the bialgebra and manin triple becomes
rather a tough job. in order to dene  models with poisson-lie duality symmetry, we need
to consider the following relations [3]:

g1xig = a(g)i

jxj,

g1 x ig = b(g)ijxj + d(g)i

x j,

j

(4)
with g and g as elements of lie groups g and g associated with lie algebras g and g, respec-
tively. the invariance of inner product with respect to adjoint action of group together with
(2) and (4) requires the above matrices to possess the following properties:

(g) = b(g)a1(g),

d(g) = at(g),

a1(g) = a(g1),

bt(g) = b(g1),

t(g) = (g).

(5)

the matrices a(g), b(g) and (g) associated with group g can be dened in a similar way.
now, we can dene below the -model with d-dimensional target manifold m, where the group
g acts freely on it [3, 6, 7]:

s = 

1

2 z d+d[eij(+gg1)i(gg1)j + (1)

i(+gg1)iy + (2)

i+y(gg1)i

+ +yy],

(6)

where the coupling matrices are:

e = (e01 + )1,

(1) = ee01f (1),

(2) = f (2)e01e,

3

(7)
the y with ( = 1, ..., ddimg) are coordinates of m/g manifold. the matrices e01, f (1), f (2)
and f are arbitrary functions of y only. similarly, the coupling matrices of the dual -model
can be written as [6, 7]:

 = f  f (2)ee01f (1).

e = (e0 + )1,

(1) = ef (1),

(2) = f (2) e,

(8)
the target space of dual model is d-dimensional manifold m with the group g acting freely
on it. the corresponding dual action can be written as:

 = f  f (2) ef (1).

s = 

2 z d+d[ eij(+gg1)i(gg1)j + (1)i

1

(+gg1)iy + (2) i

 +y(gg1)i

+ +yy].

(9)

the actions (6) and (9) correspond to poisson-lie dual  models [3] 1. notice that if the group
g( g) besides having free action on m( m ), acts transitively over it, then the corresponding
manifolds m( m ) will be the same as the groups g( g). in this case only the rst term appears
in the actions (6) and (9). also if the group g becomes the isometry group of the manifold m
with dual abelian group g, then we get the standard nonabelian duality [2].

3 bianchi bialgebras

in this section, we use (3) to obtian the dual lie algebras g of a given 3-dimensional real
lie algebras g. then, by introducing a nondegenerate adjoint invariant bilinear form we get
the corresponding manin triples. according to behrs classication [13, 14] of 3-dimensional
bianchi lie algebras [15], the commutation relation of these algebras can be generally written
as:

[x1, x2] = ax2 + n3x3,

[x2, x3] = n1x1,

[x3, x1] = n2x2 + ax3,

(10)

where the structure constants are given in table 1 2.

table 1 : bianchi classication of three dimensional lie algebras.

1actually the noethers current associated with the action of g( g) on m ( m ) satisfy the maurer-cartan

equation with structure constants of dual lie group g(g).

for all lie algebras of table 1 we have an1 = 0. the algebras with a = 0 are called class a
while those with nonvanishing a are called class b. now we can determine the dual lie algebra
g, by using the structure constant of lie algebra g given in (10). due to the antisymmetricity
of (3) with respect to the set of indices (i, j) and (k, l), these relations, after some algebraic
calculations and with the help of (10), lead to the following nine equations

(11)

in the above equations some coeecients can be eliminated, but the reason for their presence
is due to their vanishing for some algebras. now, in order to determine the structure constants
of dual lie algebras g associated with those listed in table 1, we could write (11) for each
of them. then, by using the jacobi identity for g, we can determine f ij
3. the algebras g
reduces to lie algebras of bianchi type if (a) we use the following general form of structure
constant of a given 3-dimensional lie algebra:

k

f ij

k = ijk nlk + i

kak  j

kai,

with ai as components of a 3-vector and nij as elements of symmetric matrix with the constraint
nijaj = 0; and (b) if we work in a basis that diagonalizes the matrix nij with diagonal elements
(n1, n2, n3) and vector ak with components (a, 0, 0). but, instead of performing the above steps,
we can choose another method with rather less camputations and obtain the same results, as
follows. similar to fij

k have the following form:

k we assume that the f ij
[ x1, x2] = a x2 + n3 x3,

[ x2, x3] = n1 x1,

3after using (11) for each lie algebra, the number of equations becomes less than nine.

5

then (11) reduces to

n1n1 = 0,

aa = n2n2 = n3n3.

[ x3, x1] = n2 x2 + a x3.

(12)

(13)

hence the structure constants (a, n1, n2, n3) of the dual lie algebra g can be determined in
terms of the structure constants (a, n1, n2, n3) of the lie algebra g.
as an example, for g = ix, from (13) and table 1 we have: n1 = n2 = n3 = 0 and a is an
arbitrary constant. now, for a = 0 we obtain bianchi of type i and for a 6= 0 we get bianchi of
type v if we rescale the basis such that a = 1. therefore, the lie algebra ix has two dierent
dual lie algebras i, v . these bialgebras have already been used in references [10, 16]. as
another example we consider g = v ii0, then we have n1 = n2 = 0 and a together with n3
become arbitrary. in this case the dual lie algebra g can be one of the following four dierent
bianchi lie algebras:

1) for n3 = a = 0, we get bianchi of type i.

2) for n3 6= 0 and a = 0 via rescaling and change of basis, we get bianchi of type ii.
3) for n3 = 0 and a 6= 0 via rescaling of basis, we get bianchi of type v .
4) finally, for n3 6= 0 and a 6= 0 via rescaling of basis, we get bianchi of type iv .
therefore the lie algebra v ii0 has four dierent dual lie algebras i, ii, v , iv . we have also
determined the possible dual lie algebras of other bianchi lie algebras, where the results are
given in table 2.

as in table 2, all bianchi lie algebras, except types of ix and v iii, have more than three
dierent dual lie algebras. also bianchi algebras ii, iii, v ia and v iia can be self dual. the

6

number of dierent bialgebras listed in table 2, is 28 4. so far we have been able to obtain
all possible bialgebras associated with bianchi algebras. as it is mentioned in the previous
section, in order to have a manin triple associated with these bialgebras, we need to have a
nondegenerate ad-invariant inner product over the algebra d = g  g, such that the algebras
g and g become isotropic with respect to it. in order to obtain this inner product we choose
the set {ta} = {x1, x2, x3, x1, x2, x3} as the basis of d. notice that we have more than one
d lie algebra, but considering the algebras g and g with commutation relation (10) and (12),
respectively, we can give the general form of d.
now, writing the commutation relation of the algebras d as:

[ta, tb] = cab

ctc,

with a, b = 1, ..., 6, the structure constants cab
then the basis ta will have the following matrix form in the adjoint representation of d:

c can be obtained by using (1), (10) and (12).

similarly, x i, adjoint representation of the basis of dual bianchi lie algebras g, and y i
have the same form as xi and yi) with the dierence that we must replace the set (a, n1, n2, n3)
with (a, n1, n2, n3).
since, in general, lie algebra d is non-semisimple, the nondegenerate ad-invariant inner prod-
uct on it can not be obtained via the trace of bilinear product of those algebras in adjoint
representation.
in other words killing form is degenerate for these algebras. therefore, in
order to obtain the nondegenerate ad-invariant metric ab in the above basis, we have to
solve the following equation [17]:

(16)

equation (16) means that the matrices ta. must be antisymmetric matrices. hence we must
nd symmetric matrix  such that the above relations holds. now, in order to determine  for

4it is clear that if the pair (g, g) form a bialgebra, then, also, the pair (g, g) will lead to another bialgebra.

therefore the total number of bialgebras of table 2 is 56.

each bialgebra of table 2, we must write ta explicitly and then, using the antisymmetricity of
ta., we nd the explicit form of . as an example, for the pair of (v, ix), the form of  is:

(17)

actually, by using (14) and (15) one can easily show that the symmetric metric (17) can be
ad-invariant metric of all 28 dierent bialgebras of table 2, that is

ta.  0

is antisymmetric for all bialgebras of table 2. hence, we choose  as the required inner
product. it is also interesting to see that the lie subalgebras of all bialgebras of table 2 are
isotropic with respect to this inner product, that is we have:

< ta, tb >= ab,

< xi, x j >=< ti, tj+3 >= i,j+3 = ij,
< x i, xj >=< ti+3, tj >= i+3,j = ij.

(18)

therefore, all bialgebras of table 2, together with the ad-invariant metric (17), form manin
triples. now we can construct -models with poisson-lie symmetries associated with the
manin triples obtained above.

4 -models and bianchi lie groups

as mentioned in section 2, in order to construct -models with poisson-lie symmetry
associated with bialgerba (g, g), we need to know a(g) and b(g). indeed for every bialgebras of
table 2, we can evaluate a(g) and b(g). hence we will have a -model as well as its dual, which
possess the poisson-lie symmetry. in this section we give general formulas for a(g) and b(g)
in terms of the sets of parameters (a, n1, n2, n3) and (a, n1, n2, n3). therefore, by appropriate
choices of these parameters, a(g) and b(g) of all bialgebras of table 2 can be evaluated. hence
we can construct all -models associated with them. to achieve this goal we parametrize the
group g in the following form:

g = e1x1e2x2e3x3,

(19)

8

where i are coordinates of the group manifold g. in order to calculate a(g) and b(g), we need
to calculate expressions such as eixixjeixi and eixi x jeixi. to do this, we must use the
algebraic relations (1), (10) and (12). to make the calculation simple, we need to work with
basis of d, where we have 5:

eixitaeixi = eititaeiti = (eiti)a

b

tb.

(20)

therefore, we must calculate matrices eiti, where due to the particular block diagonal form
of ti (14), in general, they have the following form:

eiti =   eixi

bi

0

ei(xi)t ! .

(21)

to calculate (21) we need to know the block diagonal form di of matrices ti together with
matrices si, then we have:

sitis1

i = di,

eiti = s1

i eidisi.

now we put each ti into its block diagonal form separately. for t1 we have:

similarly, for the matrices t2 and t3, we have calculated the matrices s2 and s3, which trans-
form them into their jordan forms d2 and d3 (these matrices are given in appendix a). finally,
using these jordan forms together with (22) and considering (21), we obtain the following ex-
pressions for matrices e2t2 and e3t3:

now, considering the defenitions of b(g) and a(g) given in (4), in general we have [3]:

hence due to (19) and (20) we have:

e1t1e2t2e3t3 =   a(g)

b(g)

d(g) ! .

finally, by using (21) we get:

a(g) = e1x1e2x2e3x3,

(30)

(31)

(32)

indeed by the above mentioned prescription, we can evaluate a(g) and b(g). since the set of
a(g) and b(g) associated with bialgebra (g, g) is the same as the set a(g) and b(g) of bialgebra
(g, g), therefore in order to write a(g) and b(g), it is enough to replace the parameters i and
(a, n1, n2, n3) with i and (a, n1, n2, n3) in (31) and (32), respectively. as an example, in order
to determine a(g) and b(g) of the pair (ix, v ), we just need to calculate a(g) and b(g) of the
pair (v, ix), provided that we replace the coordinates i with i.
so far all calculations have been done on the basis of the parametrization (19) for bianchi lie
groups g. in the case of usual parametrization of each of bianchi groups 6, one only needs
to consider the order of multiplication of matrices eiti in (31), based on the chosen group
parametrization, then the required relations (32) can be obtained for this new representation.
now, knowing the matrices (g) and (g) we can write the related -models and their poisson-
lie dual models. as it has been already mentioned, we can associate a pair of dual  models
to each bialgebra of table 2. of course some of these models have already been studied. for
example models related to the bialgebras (i, g) (standard nonabelian duality) with m as four
dimensional space-time manifold (bianchi cosmological models) have already been studied
in details [18]. dual -models associated with bialgebra (ix, v ) have been investigated in
[10, 11, 16]. also in [12] the dual models of bialgebra (v iii, v ) have been considered. here
in this article we just express two pair of dual -models associated with bialgebras of table 2.
in the following examples, we assume that m is a four dimensional manifold with ({y} = {t}).
also, we assume that f (1) = f (2) = 0 and f = 1, while the group parametrization is the same
as (19). hence the action (6) reads:

s = 

1

2 z d+d[(e01 + )1

ij(+gg1)i(gg1)j + +tt],

and from (9) its dual action is:

s = 

1

2 z d+d[(e0 + )1 ij

(+gg1)i(gg1)j + +tt].

(33)

(34)

as an example we rst start with bialgebra (ii, ii) which is a typical example of self-dual
bialgebras. using the informations of table 1 together with the relations (24-29) we can
evaluate all matrices needed to determine (g) 7, where these have been given in the appendix
b. finally the matrix (g) of this model can be written as:

also we have

(g) = b1 = 


0
0
0 1

0
0
0 1
0

.




dg.g1 = (d1 + 2d3)x1 + d2x2 + d3x3.

(35)

(36)

now by considering e0 = i, from (33) we have (in world sheet coordinate):

s = 

1

2 z dd [11+2213+

1

1 + 1

2 22+(2

2+

1

1 + 1

2 )33+tt].
(37)

6 for the group ix this parametrization is of eulerian type, and for other groups the form of parametrization

is g = e1x3 e3x2 e2x1 [15].

7in caculating these matrices we must remove a series of ambiguities.

11

actually this is a self-dual model with respect to poisson-lie dual transformation. indeed if
we choose e0 as an arbitrary invertible constant matrix then the dual -model again will be
the same as the original one but we must replace elements of e0 with those of e01. actually
this particular example is similar to two dimensional borelian dual models of reference [3].
another example is related to the bialgebra (ii, v ). again, after calculating the matrices
(24-29) given in appendix b, (g) can be written as:

(g) = 


0
2
3

2 3
0
0
0
0

.




(38)

here dg.g1 has the same form as (36). hence for e0 = i, from (33) the action of the original
model is:

s = 

1

2 z dd{

1
2 + 3
1 + 2

2 [11 + 2213 + (1 + 3

2)22

finally, by calculating matrices (24-29), as given in appendix b, we determine (g):

+ (1 + 22

2)33] + tt}.

(g) = e 1

on the other hand, we have:

dg.g1 = d 1 x 1 + e 1d 2 x 2 + e 1d 3 x 3.

(39)

(40)

(41)

then from (34) the dual model can be written as:

s = 

1

2 z dd [ 1 1 +

e2 1

1 + e2 1sinh2 1

( 2 2 +  3 3) + tt]

concluding remarks

we have obtained dual algebras of all bianchi type algebras. then by introducing a
non-degenerate adjoint invariant inner product over (six dimensional) lie algebra of drinfeld
double, we have obtained many real bialgebras listed in table 2. as it has been shown above,
we can associate a pair of poisson-lie dual -models to every pair of bialgebras of table 2.
this point is explained by two examples; the rest will apear in furture works. beside intro-
ducing associated -models with poisson-lie dualities, there are other important problems to
be studied, and we mention some of them in the following.
one of the rather interesting problems could be determination of modular space of each of drin-
feld doubles related to table 2. also, because of canonical transformation nature of poisson-lie
t-duality, it would be interesting to nd the generating function of these canonical transforma-
tions for each bialgebra of table 2 [7]; similar to the work done in [11] for (ix, v ). notice that
here the algebra d can have more than one decomposition such as d = (gg) and d = (kk).
hence it is possible to nd canonical transformation which relates the -model with group g
to the one with group k [6]. on the other hand, one can research the commutativity of the
renormalisation ow with poisson-lie t-duality, by explicit computing of the beta functions
and weyl anomaly coecients at the 1-loop level for these -models and their duals. of course
this work has already been done in [10] for (ix, v ). finally, there is a possibility that some
of these models have application in string cosmology [19]; then the poisson-lie t-duality will
play a key role in interelating dierent cosmological models and their solutions.
