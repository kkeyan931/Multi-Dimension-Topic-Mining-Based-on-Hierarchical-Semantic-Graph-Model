abstract

it is shown, that instanton eects naturally produce quark conne-
ment in mssm qcd. the connement scale, calculated from the rst
principles, is in a good agreement with the experimental data. the
proposed explanation is quite dierent from the dual higgs mechanism.

1 introduction

the connement of quarks is a very important and long standing prob-
lem of the quantum eld theory. up to now this problem remains unsolved.
however, the phenomenon of connement is guessed to be a consequence of
nonperturbative eects. recently there is a considerable progress in under-
standing of this eld, because in the simplest model (n=2 supersymmetric
yang-mills theory with su(2) gauge group) seiberg and witten [1] managed
to nd a sum of all instanton corrections in the constant eld limit.

it appears, that the supersymmetry considerably simplies the investiga-
tion of nonperturbative dynamics because of the nonrenormalization theorems.
moreover, the indirect experimental data [2, 3] conrm the existence of n=1
supersymmetry in the standard model. that is why the supersymmetric case
is the most interesting for physical applications. in this paper we argue, that
the connement is a consequence of supersymmetry and can take place only
in supersymmetric theories. the explanation is dierent from the dual higgs
mechanism [4], which is usually used for understanding of this phenomenon.
it is based on the structure of exact (nonperturbative) superpotential and
essentially uses the existence of auxiliary eld d in supersymmetric theories.

the great dierence between qcd and grand unication scales (so called
gauge hierarchy problem) can be considered as an implication, that the instan-
ton eects also play an important role in understanding of the connement.
the matter is that 2 quite dierent scales naturally arise in instanton calcu-
lations [5], their ratio being proportional to exp(82/e2). however, various
forms of exact superpotential [6, 7, 8] do not lead to the connement. more-
over, the approach, based on the consideration of composite elds as new
degrees of freedom [7, 9, 10], suers from some serious problems [11]. for ex-
ample, it seems more natural, that the eective action should depend on the
original elds. this approach was developed in [11]. the holomorphic part
of the superpotential was found to coincide with the seiberg-witten solution,
but depended on a dierent argument, which could be obtained in the frames
of perturbation theory.

in the present paper we consider su(3)-sector of minimal supersymmetric
standard model (mssm) and investigate physical consequences of this theoret-
ical construction. we argue, that it naturally leads to the quark connement.

the paper is organized as follows:
in section 2 we remind the structure of exact superpotential for su(3)
sector of mssm, which is a sum of a perturbative result and instanton contri-
butions. in particular, it depends on the gauge and auxiliary elds in a very
specic way. then, in section 3, we explain how this dependence naturally
leads to the quark connement. it is shown, that there are 2 dierent phases
in the theory: the conning phase at distances, larger than the critical one,
and the usual one at small distances. in this section we also obtain the in-
terquark potential. the scale of connement is calculated and compared with
the experimental data in section 4. the results are briey discussed in the
conclusion.

2 structure of mssm qcd eective superpo-

tential

let us remind the structure of exact superpotential, which was obtained
in [11]. first we note, that instanton corrections and a perturbative result
depend on the same parameter z [8, 11], so that

here z  e82/e2

m 3ncnf ,  (a) is seiberg-witten solution

and z = a4. the function a(u) and ad(u) have the following form [1]:

therefore, the investigation of instanton contributions is reduced to the

investigation of perturbative corrections to the eective action.
the one-loop -function of the considered model is given by

(e) = 

e3
162 (cgauge + c + cq + csq)

where

cgauge = 11;

c = 2;

cq = 4;

csq = 2

(4)

(5)

are contributions of gluons (with ghosts), gluino, quarks and squarks respec-
tively.

in the mssm gluino, quarks and squarks are massive. we will denote their
masses as m, mq and msq respectively. therefore, the corresponding one-loop
contributions in the low-energy limit will be proportional to ln(m/m), where
m is an uv-cuto. it is convenient to chose m equal to the grand unication
scale.

the su(3) group is not broken, so that the corresponding gauge bosons
remain massless. that is why ir-eects are very important in this case. note,
that we are interested in the eective action, which can be found, for example,
in the constant eld limit. nevertheless, there is no need to perform the

3

calculation, because the supersymmetry allows to guess the form of the result
[12].

really, performing the calculations in the constant eld limit we should
obtain a function of f. however, the only chiral supereld, which includes
it and does not contain anticommuting elds in the lowest component, is

b = 

1
8

d(1  5)d(w 
a )2

(6)

(the index a goes over the generators of a gauge group.) the lowest component
of this supereld has the following form:

b(x, ) = (da)2 

1
2

(f a

(7)

thus, the supereld b is a natural infrared cuto. taking into account di-
mensional arguments, we nd, that the one-loop contributions of gauge bosons
should be proportional to

ln

m
b 1/4

(8)

therefore, using (5) and omitting a constant factor, the parameter z can be
written as

z = e82/e2

m 3 m4

where we introduced a notation

below we will see, that c is a typical scale of connement.

c = (cid:16)e82/e2

m 3m4

(9)

(10)

of course, the expressions (9) and (10) are rather formal, because all masses
of quarks and squarks are dierent. strictly speaking, one should perform a
substitution

mq  (cid:16)det(mq)j

;

i(cid:17)1/6

msq  (cid:16)det(msq)j

i(cid:17)1/6

but (9) is simpler and more convenient for the further discussion.

3 mechanism of connement

note, that the auxiliary eld d is a real quantum eld. this eld should
be eliminated by the equations of motion. in the considered low energy limit
all squarks wave functions should be substituted by their vacuum expectation
values, which are equal to 0, because the su(3) gauge group is unbroken.
therefore, the motion equation for d should be found from the action

 =

note, that in this expression the auxiliary eld d is present only in the

combination

b = (da)2

(13)

due to the supersymmetry and equation (7). performing the integration over
the anticommuting variable, it is easy to see, that the bosonic part of the
lagrangian can be written as

(12)

(14)

lbose =

1
8

im(cid:16)bf (b)(cid:17)

where f (b)   (z1/4(b)).
a value of the auxiliary eld d should minimize this expression. because
in the absence of the magnetic eld ff = 0, the parameter b can be
considered to be real.
a plot of the function im(cid:16)bf (b)(cid:17) is presented at the fig.1. (for simplicity

we set c = 1 at all gures.)

writing a(u) and ad(u) in terms of elliptic functions [13], it is easy to see,
that this function has the only minimum in the point b0, which satises the
condition

a(b0) = z1/4(b0) = 4/

(15)

(note, that the considered function is not dened at b = 0.)

in the minimum point  (z(b0)) = 0, so that there is no kinetic term for
 is a lagrange multiplier,

the gauge eld in the vacuum state. therefore, aa
corresponding to the constrain

5

j a
 = 0

(16)

this constrain means, that there are no color asymptotic states in the theory
or, by other words, the color charges are conned.

at the rst sight one can conclude, that the color charges, in principle, can
not exist in dierent space points. really, the kinetic term for the yang-mills
theory is usually written as

1
4e2 trf 2





(17)

where f = a a+i[a, a]. if this term is absent, the eective charge
becomes innite, that, in turn, leads to the innitely strong interaction.
however, it is necessary to take into account the chromomagnetic eld,

produced by quarks. in the simplest static case it is

if the magnetic eld is absent

aa

 =

qa
r

0

b = (da)2 + ( ~ea)4

(18)

(19)

therefore, for suciently small r the second term is larger than b0 and it is

impossible to reach the minimum of im(cid:16)bf (b)(cid:17) by any choice of a real auxiliary

eld d. from the plot, presented at the fig.1, we see, that this function
is monotonically growing. therefore, in this case its smallest possible value
corresponds to the smallest value of b, that, in turn, corresponds to d = 0.
of course, now b 6= b0 and  (b) 6= 0; the gauge eld has a kinetic term and the
theory behaves as the usual quantum chromodynamics.
so, we conclude, that there are two completely dierent phases in the
theory: in the rst one, corresponding to b0 > ( ~ea)4, the value of auxiliary
eld d is not equal to 0, the kinetic term for the gauge eld is absent and the
color charges are conned. in the other b0 < ( ~ea)4, d = 0 and the theory can
be described by usual methods. the point of phase transition rc corresponds
to

b0 = ( ~ea)4 

1
r4

(20)

from (9) and (15) we conclude, that

6

(b0)1/4 = c  4

!4/11

(21)

and, therefore, c is really a typical scale of connement.

however, the proposed mechanism does not lead to the linear interquark
potential. really, for r > rc the potential is innitely large, while for r < rc it
satises the equation

so that

~(cid:16)imf (1/r4)~u(cid:17) = const (~r)

(22)

(23)

u(r)  z

dr

r2(cid:16)imf (1/r4)(cid:17)

this potential is plotted at the fig.2. (as earlier, c = 1 and, moreover,
we omit color charges for simplicity (it means, that rc = (b0)1/4).) a nor-
malization of the potential is chosen so that u(rc) = 0. it is worth to note,
that the derivative of the potential in the critical point is continuous, because
im f (b0) = 0. (it is not quite evident from the presented plot).

4 connement scale

the value of the coupling constant at the grand unication scale is ap-
proximately equal to e2 = 1/2 [14]. therefore, using (10) we nd, that the
connement scale can be written as

c = me162/11 m4

qm2
m 8

m2
sq

!1/11

(24)

unfortunately, we do not know the masses of superpartners. moreover, in
the expression for the parameter z we omit a constant factor, which can be
suciently large (although in c this factor comes in 1/11 power and, therefore,
it seems, that the corresponding contribution is approximately equal to 1).

however, a very rough estimate can be made. assuming all masses equal

to 10  100 gev (m = 2  1016 gev), we obtain, that

5 conclusion.

in the present paper we propose a mechanism of connement, quite dier-
ent from the dual higgs mechanism [4], which is usually used for understanding
of this phenomenon. the connement seems to be a natural consequence of
the supersymmetry and instanton eects. the corresponding scale, calculated
from the rst principles, is in a good agreement with the experimental data
(taking into account an uncertainty in masses of superpartners). however, the
presented mechanism does not lead to the linearly growing interquark poten-
tial.
in the rst one
(at distances, larger than the critical value rc) the kinetic term for the gauge
eld is absent and the potential is innitely large, while in the second one the
theory behaves in a usual way.

instead of it there are 2 completely dierent phases.

of course, the presented mechanism of connement is not reduced to this
potential  it appears, that color states are absent at the large distances, that
is actually observed in the nature. moreover, we obtain connement of electric
(instead of magnetic) charges and do not need to use duality.

however, to check the proposed ideas it is necessary to investigate pre-
dictions for the hardron spectrum and to construct the eective lagrangian,
describing the scattering of mesons and barions, comparing the results with
the experiment.
