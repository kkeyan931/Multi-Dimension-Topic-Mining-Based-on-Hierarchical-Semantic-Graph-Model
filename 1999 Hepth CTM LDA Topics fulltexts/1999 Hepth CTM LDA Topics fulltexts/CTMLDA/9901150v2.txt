abstract

we construct new f-theory vacua in 8-dimensions. they are coming by projective
realizations of f-theory on k3 surfaces admitting double covers onto p2, branched
along a plane sextic curve, the so called double sextics. the new vacua are associated
with singular k3 surfaces.
in this way the stable picture of the heterotic string is
mapped at the triple points of the sextic. we argue that this formulation incorporates
naturally the sp(4, z) invariance that the extrapolating four dimensional vector mul-
tiplet sector of all heterotic vacua may possess. in addition, we describe the way that
the 4d g=2 description of (0,2) moduli dependence of n = 1 gauge coupling constants
may be connected to riemann surfaces, with natural sp(4, z) duality invariance. here
we recover a novel way to break space-time supersymmetry and x the moduli param-
eters in the presence of wilson lines. in the context of arithmetic of torsion points on
elliptic curves, we describe in detail, the derivation of the elliptic brations in weier-
strass form. we also consider the heterotic duals to compactications of f-theory in
four dimensions belonging to isomorphic classes of elliptic curves with points-cusps of
order two. for the latter theories, we calculate the n = 2 4d heterotic prepotential
ft t t corresponding to 0(2)t  o(2)u classical perturbative duality group and their
conjugate modular theories.

introduction and motivation

at the current state of the art the ve perturbative string theories (psts) are connected
among themselves through the various dualities. in addition, they are regarded that they
originate from compactications of the same underlying higher dimensional theory, m- of f-
theory. in this way, dierent choise of formulations of unied theories at dierent directions
in the moduli space are being used to derive novel features than could not be seen, easily,
by the use of another unied theory. thus, it appears that problems like that of the correct
prediction of newton constant may be solved in four dimensional compactications, if m-
theory is used [2]. on the other hand, f-theory compactications [7, 8] are used to examine
the appearance of non-perturbative gauge symmetries for the heterotic string. the common
principle in the examination of consistency of the compactications involved is that they
all correctly reproduce, via duality, the weak coupling expansion of the heterotic string in
four dimensions. on the other hand, 4d n = 1 perturbative heterotic string vacua and
their eleven dimensional compactication extensions in four dimensions are considered to
be phenomenologically promising and furthermore possess a lagrangian description contrary
to the existing f-theory formulation.

howerer, the n = 1 4d eective supergravity vacua of its low energy modes are dened
in terms of three quantities, namely the kahler potential k, the superpotential w, and
the gauge kinetic function f, which appear as too many. instead we would prefer to have
a theory that everything could be dened in terms of only one quantity.
is there such
in 4d n = 2 eective low energy supergravity theories,
a theory? the answer is yes.
the vector multiplet sector of the theory, in its coulomb phase, is dened in terms of one
quantity, the holomorphic prepotential f.

however, there is a general weakness in the way we take into account quantum correc-
tions. that is the quantum theory when loop corrections are taken, or not, into account is
not dened so that it is manifestly sp(4, z) invariant. let us explain this in more detail.
take for example the four dimensional compactications of the heterotic string on a k3t 2.
the 4d theory has n = 2 supersymmetry and originates from further toroidally compact-
ied the n = 1 d = 6 heterotic vacua which in turn are dual to f-theory compactied
on a calabi-yau 3-fold on an hirzebrush fn surface base. the vector multiplet eective
action, all the couplings in the eective lagrangian, is xed completely, in perturbation
theory, by the knowledge 1 of the holomorphic prepotential f . in turn, the kahler poten-
tial is dened via the use of the special geometry by the holomorphic symplectic vectors
1the equations which determine directly the one loop correction to the prepotential f of any n = 2

d = 4 heterotic vacuum for rank three (s-t), and four (s-t-u) models were given in [9].

(1)

the target-space duality transformations act on the space of those vectors as sp(2n + 2, r)
transformations on the period vector . alternatively k can be expressed [10] in terms of
the t, u neutral moduli and the wilson lines b, c of the t 2 torus as

k = log[(t + t )(u + u )  (b + c)( b + c)] = det(m  m),

where

m =   t b

c u ! .

(2)

(3)

in the latter case the eective theory of light modes is invariant, if we ignore the gravitational
sector contribution of the dilaton and graviphoton, due to the presence of the discrete shifts
in the theta angle at the quantum level, under the target space modular group sp(2r; z).
here r is the number of moduli. in our case r = 2 and sp(2r; z) acts as

m    a b

c d ! m,

c d !  sp(4; z).

(4)

however, the calculation of the quantum corrections e.g the one loop corrections to the
gauge or gravitational couplings, the n = 2 prepotential, are determined in terms of the
basis for modular forms for the group sl(2, z) and the sl(2, z) j-invariant and not those
associated with sp(4, z).

the question that now arises is if the theories involved in the compactications of the
ve perturbative string theories, including m, f-theories, with quantum eects may be
dened so that they are manifestly sp(4, z) invariant? putting the question dierently,
can we express the quantum corrections in terms of sp(4, z) entities like the basis 2 of
modular forms for the group sp(4, z), making the sp(4, z) invariance manifest? note that
we wish to dene the dierent unied theories in terms of riemann surfaces having sp(4, z)
invariance. obviously, the answer to our question is negative. apart from some exceptions
unied theories are dened with no manifest sp(4, z) invariance. previous attempts of
description of quantum eects where the ring of modular forms for the sp(4, z) is used are
evident in some works. in [10] the moduli dependence of the one loop corrections to the
gauge coupling constants in 4d n = 1 orbifold compactications of the heterotic string was
translated from the language of the basis of modular forms for the sl(2, z) on the basis of

2the latter entities are made of the usual modular forms for the sl(2, z) modular group e4, e6 and

the cusp forms c10, c12.

2

modular forms for sp(4, z). in [11] the calculation of the degeneracy of n = 4 bps states
was dened in terms of genus 2 theta functions. however, an apparent question remains on
those approaches. namely, which is the riemann surface where the vector moduli of the
so(3, 2) t2 torus live? the latter question is meaningful both in the context of heterotic
string [10] and in the context of f-theory.

take for example the f-theory/heterotic duality in 8-dimensions [7, 22]. here, compact-
ications of f-theory on a k3 which admits an elliptic bration with a section is on the
same moduli space so(18, 2; z)\so(18, 2)/so(18) so(2), as the e8e8 heterotic string
on a t 2 torus. the elliptic bration with a section, represented by dening a torus with
a p1 base, represents the f theory dual to the e8  e8 heterotic string are given by a two
parameter (, ) family with base coordinate z, as

y2 = x3 + z4x + (z5 + z6 + z7).

(5)

because the torus is a genus one curve the map between the parameters (, ) and the
complex structure parameters of the t 2 torus, namely (, ), is expressed in terms of the
j-invariant, the modular function for the torus [12]. as a result at the quantum level the
basic quantities of the heterotic string are dened in terms of the inherited f-theory j-
invariant. note that at the large  limit the complex structure  of the t 2 of the heterotic
string is identied with the complex structure of the elliptic ber (5). it is the presence of
the j-invariant that signals the lacking sp(4, z) invariance which is eminent through all the
f-theory formulation.

there is another area however, when the question of the riemann surface with sp(4, z)
invariance is meaningful. take for example n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills. at the
coulomb phase in four dimensions the moduli space of the r vector multiplets, when charged
hypermultiplet matter is not present, is invariant under sp(4r; z). the n = 2 su(r +
1)theory is associated with genus r riemann surfaces, e.g the n = 2 su(2) theory is
described by a genus 1 surface, the n = 2 su(3) with genus 2 and so on. uniqueness and
universality is lost as for r > 1, the theory instead of being simpler, as the gauge group
increases and the number of wilson lines that break the initial observable e8 gauge group
decreases, it is dened on even higher genus surfaces. instead we require in this work that
we want to describe 8d f-theory realizations in terms of double covers of k3 brations that
are branched always along a xed form plane curve, the double sextic. in the latter sence
we always work with the universal form sextic curve.

in this work, we will present a riemann surface that possess sp(4, z) invariance that
we will argue is connected to the 4d heterotic string. in addition, we will present f-theory
solutions in eight dimensions whose six dimensional versions, that we hope to address in a
future work, may be connected directly to the sp(4, z) riemann surfaces.

in section 2, we describe the connection of the mordell-weyl group to the existence of
weierstrass form of rational elliptic surfaces with a section. we give explicitly the derivation

3

of the weierstrass models for the various forms of torsion subgroups. these weierstrass mod-
els as rational elliptic surfaces will be used in the next section to understand the equivalence
between k3 surfaces admitting elliptic bration and maximizing sextics at the degeneration
limit of the f-theory/heterotic duality limit. in section 3, we describe the representation
of k3 surfaces as double covers onto p2 branched along a plane sextic and its connection
to 8d f-theory/heterotic duality. in addition, we explain the correspondence of the plane
sextics to the extremal elliptic brations. in section 4, we discuss the riemann surfaces,
appearing in genus two and are connected to the calculations of moduli dependence of the
one loop gauge couplings for non-vanishing background elds in n = 1 four dimensional
heterotic (0, 2) string compactications, namely the binary sextics. in section 5, we present
our results for the n = 2 4d heterotic theories which exhibit target space modular group
o(2)t  o(2)u . these theories may come from further compactication on a k3 of 8d
f-theory compactications with z2 torsion subgroup or from toroidal compactication of
the 6d f-theory on a calabi-yau 3-fold over a 2d base.

2 rational points on elliptic curves

in this section we will explain the appearance of the mordell-weyl group in 8-dimensional
compactications of f-theory, realised on elliptically bered k3 surfaces. we will partic-
ularly explore, one side of the iceberg, namely representations of k3 surfaces which are
realised on genus one curves, those admitting elliptic bration with a section. we are par-
ticularly interested in examining the degeneration limit of the f-theory/heterotic duality[22]
where the k3 surface breaks into two rational elliptic surfaces. the other side of the iceberg
is the representation of k3 surfaces admitting double covers of p2 along a plane sextic and
their projective realizations and it will be treated in the next section .

let me start with a few denitions. the weierstrass form comes from the most general

cubic that can be written in p2 coordinates as

f (x, y, w) = cyyyy3 + cxyyxy2 + cxxyx2y + cyywy2w + cxywxyw + cywwyw2 + cxxxx3+
cxxwx2w + cxwwxw2 + cwwww3.

(6)

when a number of conditions is applied to (6) it can always be reduced in the general

projective3 weierstrass form in p2 which reads

y2w + a1xyw + a3yw2 = x3 + a2x2w + a4xw2 + a6w3.

(7)

these conditions can be summarized as follows :

3 the subscripts of the coecients denote the homogeneity of the corresponding term under a change of

variables.

4

 demanding the curve (6) to pass through (x, y, w) = (0, 1, 0) we get cyyy = 0.
 having (0,1,0) as a non-singular point gives us cyyw 6= 0 or cxyy 6= 0.
 having the curve f (x, y, w) = w as a tangent line at innity point (0,1,0) we get one
more condition cxyy = 0 and from the previous condition cyyw 6= 0.
lastly because a non-singular point p of f is a ex or inection point if the intersection
multiplicity of the tangent line of f at p is greater or equal to 3, the curve (6) can have an
inection point at (0,1,0) if cxxy = 0 and cxxx 6= 0.
under these conditions the cubic takes the form

f = cxxxy2w + cxywxyw + cywwyw2 + cxxxx3 + cxxwx2w + cxwwxw2 + cwwww3.

(8)

this form is known as weierstrass form. by setting w = 1 we can put the cubic in the ane
weierstrass form as

y2 + a1xy + a3y = x3 + a2x2 + a4x + a6.

(9)

the subscripts in the coecients of the non-singular cubic indicate the degree of homogeneity
under a certain change of variables. note that (9) is singular only if a3 = a4 = 0.

as usual, compactications of heterotic string on t 2, in the context of its duality with
f-theory on a k3 surface in 8 dimensions, are realized in terms of an elliptic curve over4 a
eld k, namely as a non-singular cubic that is in a weierstrass form.

an elliptic curve over a the eld of rationals q is dened as a non-singular cubic in
weierstrass form with rational coecients. the elliptic curve over q is realized by com-
pleting the square in the weierstrass form followed by a change of variables in y to get
y2 = r(x), where r(x) a cubic in degree 3 with distinct roots. in the latter form, namely
(9) the inection point is mapped to the point at innity o = (0, 1, 0) such that it becomes
the line at innity. for the non-singular cubic curve, the existence of a specied point o,
denes a group operation on the curve associating the points on the curve with an abelian
group, the mordell-weyl group (mw), with o its identity element. what the mw group
theorem says is that the group of rational points of an elliptic curve over q, e(q), is nitely
generated. the mw group can be written as e(q)  z r   , where  is a nite abelian
group known as the torsion subroup. the integer r is the rank of e(q). given now the
ane cubic in (9) and the denition of the mw group we need to know how it is possible
to construct for a given mw group its weierstrass form. the weierstrass form for the di-
ferent choises of the mw group may be associated with the appearance of the non-simply
connected gauge groups [19] in 8-dimensional compactications of f-theory on a k3 surface
at its degeneration limit in the next section. we note that the torsion subgroup f of an
elliptic curve when the eld of integers k is equal to the eld of rational functions becomes
the group of sections.

4note that the ane plane k2 = (x, y) has a standard one to one embedding into p2(k). in turn , p2(k)

is dened as the quotient of (x, y, w)  (k3  (0, 0, 0)).

5

before addresing the weierstrass construction, let me give rst few denitions concerning

the group formation on elliptic curves that will help us to understand the procedure.

 given an initial point o, we dene the group law on non-singular cubics in terms of the
identity element xed at o = (x, y, w) = (0, 1, 0). in addition, we dene r = p q = p  q
as the line element between two dierent points p, q on the curve. the addition law for
a point in the curve is dened as the multiplication p + q = o  p q. this operation
makes the points on the curve to form an abelian group with o as the identity element,
p + o = o  po = p . negatives are dened by rst setting oo as the third point on
the line tangent at o. by denition p def= oop . this means p def= (oo)  p . so
p + (p ) = o  p (p ) = ooo = o. note for the elliptic curve over the eld of rationals
we dene oo = o as the inection point. in addition, for a general point p = (xo, yo) on
the elliptic curve (9) the inverse p = (xo,yo  a1xo  a3). we can easily see that for
example when
(10)

a1 = a3 = 0, p = (xo,yo).

next let us look at the determination of the weierstrass form of the elliptic brations
admitting torsion points using the ane form (9). for the study of the mordell-weyl group
it is enough to examine the behaviour of the elliptic curve (9) at at the point p=(0,0). the
latter means a6 = 0 and eqn.(9) becomes

y2 + a1xy + a3y = x3 + a2x2 + a4x.

(11)
now what happens is that e(k) becomes an abelian group with o = (0, 1, 0) the point at
innity as identity element of the group law on the elliptic curve. the condition that the
torsion subgroup  = z2 is equivalent to the statement that p + p = o (or p = p ).
in other words p is of order two if the tangent is  at p, that means vertical tangency.
since the point at innity is non-singular, to study singular points, as we said already we
translate the points on the curve at the point (0, 0). that had set a6 = 0. note that eqn.
(9) is singular only when a3 = a4 = 0. by taking now dierentials in eqn. (9) we deduce
that the coecient of dy equals zero at p. this means that a3 = 0. now the weierstrass
form of the elliptic curve becomes



 = z2,

y2 + a1xy = x3 + a2x2 + a4x.

.

(12)

in the special case that a1 = 0 (12) gives the same weierstrass equation as that appearing
in [20, 19] . in general for an elliptic curve over the eld k = q,  must be one of the
following fteen groups[20]

z, z2, z3, . . . z9, z10, z12, z2  z2, z4  z2, z6  z2, z8  z2

(13)

for an elliptic curve over the complex numbers k = c there are in addition four more

possibilities. they are listed by cox and parry[15] as

z3  z3, z6  z3, z4  z4, z5  z5.

(14)

6

in the case where the points of the elliptic surface over c(t), are rationals, the rational
elliptic curve can be written as an elliptic surface with a section s, a jacobian[17]. note
that the weierstrass forms that we examine in this paper are associated with standard
compactications of f-theory [22, 7, 8] in 8 dimensions where the antisymmetric b-eld is
zero5. as the methods discussing other possibilities for the torsion subgroup 6 are not
present in string theory literature we can briey discuss them here. if we examine higher
orders in the torsion subgroup f we need the coordinates of the point 2p. at the tangent
line at a general point p=(x,y) on the cubic (9) the coordinates of the point 2p are given
by

x(2p ) =

where

x4  b4x2  2b6x  b8

3  a2
4.

b6 = a2

3 + 4a6,

let us examine its consequences. for the singular point p = (0, 0) eqn. (10) gives

 p = (0, a3)

(17)
lets us see now how torsion points of order three,  = z3 and higher are embedded in the
general equation (9) of the elliptic curve. let us now make the following isomorphic7 change
of variables in eqn. (11).

2p = (a2, a1a2  a3)

gives us that

(x, y)  (x, y + a1

3 a4x)

(18)

(19)
torsion of order three means 2p + p = o. in other words 2p = p , p = (0, a3) and
a2 = 0. thus for

y2 + a1xy + a3y = x3 + a2x2.

 = z3,


lets us now return back into eqn.

y2 + a1xy + a3xy = x3.

(20)

(19). making another change of variables, to an

isomorphic curve, in the form

(x, y)  (

point (0, 1, 0) and carry the line w=0 at the same line. the latter is important since the line w = 0 is the
line at innity.

7

we get that the point p=(0,0) remains xed and (19) is transformed into

y2 + a1

 (b, c) = (1  c)4b3  (1  c)3b3  8(1  c)2b4 + 36(1  c)b4 + 16b5  27b4

(24)

and its connection to the usual from f-theory considerations discriminant  = 44 + 272
may be obvious.
we can now look at the derivation of the weierstrass form for higher than z3 torsion
subgroups. looking at (22) and repeating the previous procedure that was applied at the
z2 case, namely requiring the tangent at the point p to be tangent, we get

3p = (c, b  c),
p = (0, 0),
p = (0, b), 2p = (b, 0), 3p = (c, c2).

2p = (b, bc),

by taking subsequently
3p = p with c = 0,
 = z4,


 = (b, o) = b4 + 16b5.

3p = 2p with b = c,


 = z5,

 = (c, c),

y2 + xy  by = x3  bx2,

y2 + (1  c)xy  by = x3  bx2,

3p = 3p with b = c2 + c.


 = z6,

 = (c2 + c, c).

y2 + (1  c)xy  (c2 + c)y = x3  (c2 + c)x2,

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

there are two remaining cases of weierstrass forms representing rational elliptic surfaces
where the torsion is a subgroup of z2n  z2. in those cases the rational elliptic surface is
associated with



 = z2  z2,

y2 = x(x  )(x  ),

(29)

8

 = z4  z2,

(30)

with ,   z.

equation (29) appears in this form after the use of specic theorems while (30) comes by
demanding that one of the points (xo, 0), with xo = 0, ,  in (29) must be the double of
another number in order for the z2 z2 to ow at z4 z2. that means that  =  2,  = 2
in (30). the weierstrass representations of the elliptic brations with a section in eqn.s
(12), (20), (26), (27), (28), (29), (30) are all relevant at the degeneration limit of f-theory
on the elliptic k3 studied in the next section.

y2 = x(x +  2)(x + 2).

3 eight-dimensional compactications of f-theory as k3 bra-

tions

3.1 why double covers?

in this section we examine 8 dimensional compactications of f-theory and examine the
heterotic/duality map[22, 7] at the stable degeneration limit[13, 26]. according to this
duality map, f-theory on a k3 surface admitting an elliptic bration with a section is on
the same moduli space as the heterotic string on a t 2 torus. take for example the e8  e8
heterotic string. then at the limit that the t 2 torus is large, the k3 surface degenerates
into a variety that is made from the union of two intersecting rational elliptic surfaces s1, s2
intersecting along an elliptic curve e. at this limit the j-invariant of the f-theory elliptic
curve e coincides with the j-invariant of the heterotic elliptic curve [26] representing the
t 2 torus as8

y2 = x3 + ax + b.

(31)

on the contrary the k3 sf compactication of f-theory is represented as an elliptic
bration over a p1 base, namely as a map  : sf  p1. this constitutes a form of violation
of double cover parity signalling dierent treatment of the bases of the duality pairs. we
demand that the violation of double cover parity, of the f-theory/heterotic duality map
can be corrected by considering generating the k3 surface from double covers. the latter
happens, in our case, by considering double covers of k3 onto p2, the so called double sextics.
it is known [28] that double covers of k3 onto p2 are branched along a plane sextic curve.
that idea will constitute our main tool in this section. the dierence between double covers
onto p2 and p1 brations, between the two dual sides, can intuitively be explained by the
following correspondence.

8the double cover of the complex plane x

9

consider the cubic dened by

xy2 = z(x  z)(x  z).

(32)

then two generic members of the cubic pencil9 may be described as cubic curves with
common exes at (0, 1, 0) and common tangents at (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1) and (, 0, 1). by blowing
up the base points one can obtains the quotient of e  p1 under the involution

(y, z)  (y,z),

(33)

where e is the elliptic curve connected to (0, 1,, ). the notation (y, z) refers to the
elements of ep1. in turn, two members of the cubic pencil together with its two degenerate
bers calculate four points on p1 and thus an elliptic curve e. as a result the double cover
of the rational elliptic bration along two members has apriori its double cover given by the
abelian surface e  e. if we can connect in some way the double cover of some form of
abelian surface in some form of f-theory compactications on k3 as a double cover we are
done.
maximizing sextics and singular k3 surfaces

the way to proceed is to connect the double sextics to singular k3 surfaces[27], e.g k3
surfaces for which the picard number  = h1,1. since every singular k3 surface is the double
cover of a kummer surface thay can be connected to compactications involving orbifold
limits of k3 and orientifolds. let us rst give some denitions. the lattice associated to
the latter has rank n s = 20 and signature (+1, (1)19). in general to singular k3 surfaces
one associates[27] the picard number

sin
k3 = 2 +

k

x=1

(e) + rk||,

(34)

where || is the order of the group of sections  that is the mordell-weyl group and r its
rank. the quantity (e) is associated to the number of components of the set e of the
singular bers. similarly, when a curve x is the double cover of y branched along a curve
c, then

(35)
for a plane sextic curve c coming as a double cover onto p2, 0    19. so by comparison
with (34) we can notice that the index10 (c) associated to the sextic has a similar role as

(x)  (y ) + (c).

9note that the term pencil is dened to be the dimension of the projective space that parametrizes

eqn.(32). namely one in our case.

10when we minimally resolve a singularity xn, n linearly independent rational curves in the neron-severi
group appear. then for a curve c the index is dened as the sum of the subindices n of all its the simple
singularities.

those of the singular bers of the singular k3 surfaces. in fact we will see, in the rest of the
section, in the cases of interest in 8 dimensional compactications of f-theory/heterotic du-
ality map, k3 surfaces admitting elliptic brations with a section and k3 surfaces admitting
double covers on to p2 coincide. the latter list of k3 brations has been worked out in [14].
so by considering double covers onto the base manifold on both sides of the 8-dimensional
f-theory/heterotic duality map we recover naturality in the treatment of the base.

a sextic is called maximizing if its index is maximal,  = 19. a a result from (32) it
follows that the maximizing sextic c is a singular k3 surface. if the index (s) = 19 the
singularities of the sextic are in the form a1, d2n, e7 and e8. in this case the sextic is called
supermaximizing and the number of the rational components in this case is less than ten.
that can be proved by a simple calculation of the euler number. we remind that these are
singularities of the branch curve and not its double cover. the double cover has as usual
a, d, e singularities. this suggests that in the general case k3 surfaces that are acted
by involutions not having xed points have singular bers with at least ten components.
when we have ten components those components are rational. in fact the following table
will assist us to our work later.

here, the kodaira ber are placed against their components , euler number ,

discriminant and ber of the double cover.

3.2 elliptic brations with involutions
the double cover consists of an elliptic bration  : y  > p1 and an involution  : z > z
in the general case that y is an elliptic k3 surface we can
that respects the bration.
distinguish two general cases. the case of isolated xed points and the case of no isolated
xed points. in the rst case the are eight xed points and the quotient by the involution x
is a k3 surface. that is the case that is considered in studying the chl vacuum in [24]. in
the second case there are three possibilities: a) x is a rational surface with the xed locus
appears in two components. the surface y may be coming from a double sextic, as a union
of two cubics. b) x is a rational surface but the xed locus appears in one component, and c)

11

x is an enriques surface with no xed locus and the elliptic bration has two double bers.
the point that we follow is to consider elliptic k3 brations  : y  p1, where y is an
elliptic k3 surface, and examine the eect of the involutions  that respect the bration. we
represent the involution after resolution by x = y / where tilde denotes desingularization.
we will be interested in singular sextics that can give k3 surfaces after resolution. in fact,
there are two possibilities that can be realized for the surface x. the surface x can be either
a ruled surface or an elliptic surface. those two distinctions are related to the way that the
involution  acts on the y bration. we can have x as a rational ruled surface only if each
ber is invariant under the involution and contains xed points. in fact, by blowing down
x to a minimal model xo, containing no exceptional curves of the rst kind, that can be
the hirzebrush surface f4, we obtain y, the k3 surface, as a double cover of xo branched
along a 4-section o = s + t . we denoted by s the minimal section, s2
= 4 and t is

a trisection disjoint from s. one can now observe that the index of the elliptic bration
is the index of o or t. in this case the branch locus of the covering will be a transversal
divisor hitting each rational ber exactly four times and it will appear as a sextic. in this
case the rational surface x can be represented as a p2 after afew birational modications.
in particular the k3 surface y with an extremal bration is realized as the double covering
of a maximizing sextic, only if the bration has three singular bers of the type i2, in, ii,
iii, iii. something that was practically suggested in the previous subsection. the second
case that we discuss is when x is an elliptic surface. now the quotient transposes the bers
i.e permutes them and the branch locus is made of two bers. in this case the elliptic k3
surface y may be obtained as a double sextic from a union of two cubics.

an easy way to get an elliptic bration is to have a singular point p on the sextic and
consider the elliptic bration induced by the lines through it. when done in this way, the
elliptic bration centered at the triple point of a maximizing sextic is extremal. in this case
there are more possibilities realized for the rational surface x as the torsion group can be
dierent thann unity as it was the case in the standard heterotic/f-theory duality [22, 7, 8].
the computation of the torsion group  for elliptic brations of a maximizing sextic can be
determined from the relation

d(x) = d(f)/||2.

(36)

here, d denotes the discriminant while includes the blown up kodaira singularities and the
product runs over the congurations of the singular bers. take for example the congu-
ration with i9, 3i1 bers. applying the formula (36) we get that d(x) = 1 which must be
the case as the picard lattice for a rational elliptic surface is the whole of h 2(x, z) and the
lattice is unimodular.

the results in the case of double covers are summarized as follows:

3.3 examples with point like instantons

we will discuss the case of the creation of an e8 gauge symmetry in the f-theory/heterotic
duality realization in eight dimensions[13, 26] when the k3 surface sf of f-theory compact-
ications is acted by the involution  : z > z. the resulting surface x is an elliptic
surface. now the sextic of the branch locus is made from the union of the two cubics.
at the limit that the heterotic torus is large, the k3 surface breaks up into two rational
surfaces and and each rational surface is coming by taking the double covers branched at
two bers. elliptic brations generated in this way always have sections. in the case of
e8  e8 symmetry on the f-theory side, the observed symmetry group e8 is reproduced
by the elements of the vanishing cohomology h2(si, z), with i either 1 or 2, of the rational
elliptic surface si. in geometrical terms the rational elliptic surface represented as a cubic
c0 and a exed line l forms a cubic pencil spanned by c0 and 3l. this has a ii and 2i2
bers, an thus generates an unbroken e8 gauge symmetry from point like instantons[29, 7]

13

with no local holonomy. taking the double cover of the sextic formed by the two nodal
cubics in the pencil will produce an elliptic bration of type 2ii2i2. amazingly enough it
appears that the double cover of the k3 bration can create the whole of e8  e8 gauge
symmetry. however, 2ii2i2 is the symmetry of the double cover and does not correspond
to the observed heterotic gauge symmetry.

another elliptic bration on the same k3 may be build by considering the lines through
one of the nodes. now the intersection of the two cubics11 of order nine will give rise to an
i18, the other node will give us a i2 and there are four tangent lines from the point to the
nodal cubic. in total we get the conguration i18i24i1 with the order of the mordell-weyl
group to be three. the spin(16)/z2 heterotic string comes from the conguration i4 2i1
of the rational elliptic surface of table 2. the corresponding k3 bration upon which the
involution  is acting is 2iiiv . in fact more possibilities are possible [21].

eective string theories from double covers

the question that remains from the previous considerations is if we can nd an eective
theory that can be formulated in terms of double covers and is dened in lower dimensions,
e.g four, that may be dened in the context of f-theory/heterotic duality. the heterotic
string theory dened in terms of double covers is considered in this section. we hope to
address the n = 2 four dimensional compactication of f-theory in terms of double covers
in a future work. let us now consider the usual f-theory compactication, on a calabi-yau
3-fold with an fn base [7, 8] which is on the same moduli space as the heterotic string on
a k3 surface. further compactication on four dimensions on both sides on a t 2 torus
may produce a n = 2 vector multiplet eective theory with e.g an sl(2, z)t  sl(2, z)u
if there are wilson lines on the t 2 torus the classical perturbative
duality invariance.
duality invariance of the vector multiplet eective theory becomes sp(4, z). in this case the
formulation of the eective theory of light modes is consistently described in terms on the
genus two siegel modular forms which can reproduce consistently the one loop corrections
to the gauge coupling constants of n = 1 (0, 2) orbifold compactications of the heterotic
string[10]. as we said in the introduction it is desirable to have an interpretation of the
formulation of the heterotic string compactications in terms of particular riemann surfaces
with manifest sp(4, z) invariance. here we will do just that. the way that we will proceed
in our investigation is to rst dene the basic elements that dene the n = 1 (0, 2) orbifold
compactications of the heterotic string and then describe the derivation of the riemann
surface possessing the sp(4, z) invariance.

for genus g = 1 the graded ring of modular forms is generated by the e4, e6 modular

11remember that a rational elliptic surface is the blow up of p2 at the nine intersection points of two

cubic curves, or the nine basepoints of the cubic pencil.

14

forms12. in the genus two case the graded ring is generated by the siegel modular forms
e4, e6, and the cusp forms 10, 12 and 35 where the latter are given by the following
expressions

i4 = x(m)8,
i6 = x xsyzygous(m1m2m3)4,
i10 = 214  10 = (m)2,
i12 = 2173  12 = x(m1m2 . . . m6)4,
i35 = 23953i  35 = (m)( xazygous(m1m2m3)20),

(37)

where m1 = (0, 0, 0, 0), m2 = (0, 0, 0, 1/2) and m3 = (0, 0, 1/2, 0). the sum in 12 extends
over the fteen gorel quadruple[31] a sequence of four even characteristics which form a
syzygous sequence. next consider the hyperelliptic curve for a genus 2g+2 surface in the
form

(38)

(39)

y2 = 2g+2

i=1 (x  ei) = p2g+2(x, ei), ei 6= ej, f or i 6= j,

respectively in the genus case as

y2 = 6

i=1(x  ei) = p6(x, ei), ei 6= ej, f or i 6= j,

which represents the double cover of the sphere branched over 2g+2 points, respectively 6
points. note that m = d1/8 , where d is the discriminant of p6. on the curve (38) one
can attach a lattice generated by the pair (i, ), where i is a g  g identity matrix and  is
the period matrix[32]. the surface (38) equipped with the pair (i, ) is called a jacobian.
we denote by (a1,, ag, b1, . . . , bg) the canonical homology basis on (38). in addition, we can
dene by (1, . . . , g) as the dual homology basis. note that the dual homology basis can be
dened in terms of i = xidz/y, i = 1,   , g. in fact by taking the map from the jacobian
to the complex numbers we dene the  functions

  a

b ! = xnz g+1

exp[(n + a)t (n + a) + 2i(n + a)  (z + b)]

(40)

with the usual build in sp(2g, z) invariance. one might now start to feel what we are
trying to prove. we will prove that under certain conditions all n=1 (0,2) orbifold com-
pactications of the heterotic string can be described by certain genus two curves, the binary

12the subscript denotes the modular weight of the respective modular form.

15

sextics.. in particular once the moduli coming from a heterotic string vacum are known, we
can describe the precise form of the riemann surface that they line on.
however something is still missing from our discussion. the element that we require is that
there is a birational correspondence [30] between the projective varieties associated with
the graded ring of even projective invariants of binary sextics and with the graded ring
of modular forms. in simple terms that means that the projective variety linked with the
graded ring of even projective invariants of binary sextics is a compactication of moduli of
curves of genus two.

so, by keeping in mind the analogy with the branched sextic curve coming from double

covering of p2 in the previous sections, we conjecture the following theorem :

theorem the projective variety associated with the even projective invariants of binary
sextics, for a particular (0,2) n = 1 heterotic string theory vacuum, represents the riemann
surface with manifest sp(4,z) invariance that the moduli live. lets us explain in more detail
this issue. the projective invariants a, b, c, d, of the binary sextics have degrees 2,4,6,10.
so if we symbolize by 1, 2, . . . , 6 the six roots of the sextic sox 6 + s1x 5 + . . . + s6 and
we denote their dierence i  j by (ij) the invariants take the following form

a(s) = s2

(12)2(34)2(56)2

b(s) = s4

d(s) = s10

because any sextic can be brought in the general form

x(x  1)(x  1)(x  2)(x  3)

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

we can replace each of the three lambdas in (42) by some theta functions of zero argument,
namely

1 = (

)2, 2 = (

theta functions of genus two. it can be proved that 1, 2, 3 can be expanded in terms of
even powers of  when  is small. as a result all the variables in eqn. (42) are xed and
its roots may be calculated. moreover the invariants a, b, c, d are expressed in terms of 
and s. it is remarkable that the following relations hold

d/a5  12, (b/a2)3  j(1)j(2)12, ((3c  ab))/a3)2  (j(1)  j(2))12.

or in precise form

i4 = b, i6 =

(ab  3c), i10 = d, i12 = ad, i35 = 53d2e.

(46)

that means that the uniformation parameters of the sextic (42) are xed genus two elements
therefore possessing manifest sp(4, z) invariance and therefore conrming our theorem. in
its non-perturbative form the equation for the sextic p6 involves the parametric relation
(46). note that from eqn. (45) one can notice that the fundamental invariant of the full
theory are expressed in terms of products of j-invariants. what we have not discuss is
the expansion of genus two theta functions (44) in terms of the  parameter, our wilson
lines, represents exactly the fact that the space of projective varieties corresponding to the
invariants a, b, c, d has been blown up [30] such that the jacobian variety of the genus
two curve has degenerate to products of elliptic curves. the blow up process is necessary
since the projective variety (39), does not include apriori the siegel fundamental domain.

the correspondence with the heterotic string comes after identifying 1 = t , 2 = u,
 = w ilson line. at the points that the discriminant of the projective variery of (38)
degenerates both t, u and the wilson line a, b are involved in a non-trivial relation. that
means that at the point where the discriminant of eqn. (42) vanishes one or more of the
moduli may be xed therefore breaking non-trivially space-time supersymmetry.

alternatively thinking, eqn. (39) supplied with the projective invariants a, b, c, d at
the limit of small , represents the (0, 2) perturbative expansion of the n = 2 sector of the
4d heterotic string vacuum.
by taking the equation

lets us now make a comment regarding the 8-dimensional compactications of f-theory.

(branched sextic) = 0

(47)

we may describe the riemann surface responsible for the 8-dimensional k3 brations as
double cover onto p2. those compactications that are characterized by the vanishing locus
have embedded sp(4, z) invariance and may represent how 7-branes degenerate. of course
the real test of our conjecture at this point is to test this result in its four dimensional f-
theory counterparts involving compactications on a three-fold. this task will be performed
in a future work.

5 one loop 4d heterotic prepotential for subgroups of p sl(2, z)

n = 2 heterotic string theories in four dimensions come from compactication of the ten
dimensional heterotic string on the k3  t 2. in the simplest case the eective action of
light modes is invariant under the classical modular group is sl(2, z)t  sl(2, z)u . in
this case the formulation of the six dimensional f-theory compactication, prior to further

17

compactication of a t 2 torus, has been given in [7, 8]. let us consider the usual f-
theory/heterotic duality map in eight dimensions[13]. when compactifying the f-theory
side on a k3 surface sf admitting an elliptic bration this becomes dual at the heterotic
string compactied on a t 2 torus. at the degeneration limit the j-invariant of the f-theory
elliptic curve becomes identical to the j-invariant of the heterotic elliptic curve. if we further
compactify on an another k3 surface both dual sides then what eectively happens is that
the statement about monodromy of the f-theory elliptic curve translates into a statement
about targe space duality. so by the use of the mordell-weyl group action on the f-theory
elliptic curve in the original eight dimensional compactication of f-theory we can control
the target space duality group in four dimensions.

let us now consider that our f-theory elliptic curve contains points that are associated
to a cyclic subgroup of order 2 that a generator has not been chosen.
in this case the
f-theory has monodromy o(2) and the 4d n = 2 theory coming from compactication of
the heterotic string compactied on the k3  t 2 is invariant under the target space duality
group o(2)t o(2)u . the third derivative of the prepotential of the n = 2 vector multiplet
theory is given by
