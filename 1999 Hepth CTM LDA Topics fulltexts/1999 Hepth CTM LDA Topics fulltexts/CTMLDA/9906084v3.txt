abstract

we investigate the worldvolume actions of massive iia d-branes (i.e. d-branes in a

massive iia background) and obtain explicitly in each case a supersymmetric point charge

solution of the worldvolume gauge eld with an appropriate excitation of the transverse

scalar eld. aected by the background, the form of one of the solutions is very unusual.

however, we show that the regularized energy of each solution, dened with respect to

the proper time, is proportional to the geodesic distance from the d-brane to the point

parametrized by the regularized value of the scalar eld, revealing that these solutions

correspond to fundamental strings ending on the d-branes. the tension of a fundamental

string is reproduced correctly. the massless limit of the solutions can also be taken

consistently. we conclude that the way of describing one of intersecting two branes as a

worldvolume solution of another brane has nontrivial target-space covariance.

1 introduction

to gain better understanding of string theories and m-theory, intersecting branes have

played an important role and have been studied from various points of view. among

them, worldvolume analyses have been powerful approaches to investigate the intersecting

branes[1][2][3][4][5]. in ref.[1][2][3] worldvolume eld theories of branes in at backgrounds

were examined and solutions of the theories with nontrivial congurations of gauge elds

were obtained.

in the case of d-branes, it was shown that an appropriate excitation

of one of the transverse scalar elds is needed in order to obtain a supersymmetric (i.e.

bps) point charge solution of the worldvolume gauge eld[1]. each of the solutions

was interpreted as a fundamental string ending on the d-brane because the regularized

energy of each solution is proportional to the regularized value of the scalar eld, which is
considered to be the length of the string. this interpretation is consistent with the charge
conservation suggested in ref.[6] (see also ref.[7]). these analyses are very important in

that they made clear how one of intersecting two branes is described from the viewpoint

of another branes worldvolume. after their work, many other solutions of worldvolume

theories of branes were discussed in at backgrounds (e.g. [8][9][10][11]).

in this paper we investigate these analyses further. we consider the case of d-branes in
a curved background. suppose that we construct a supersymmetric point charge solution
of the d-branes worldvolume with an appropriate excitation of one of its transverse

scalar elds. then, on the analogy of the case given in ref.[1], it is expected that the

solution corresponds to a fundamental string ending on the d-brane. however, since the

background spacetime is curved, the distance of two points should be measure not by

the simple dierence of the coordinates, but by their geodesic distance. so, if the above

expectation is true, the (regularized) energy of the solution in this case should correspond

to the mass of the string, which is proportional to the geodesic distance from the brane
to the point parametrized by the (regularized) value of the scalar eld. (we note that
with a naive calculation, the obtained energy depends on the denition of the time of

the worldvolume. so, we introduce a proper time of the worldvolume and calculate the

energy dened with respect to it.) the purpose of this paper is to examine this nontrivial

target-space covariance of the worldvolume description of intersecting branes (i.e. the

way of describing one of intersecting two branes as a worldvolume solution of another

brane), by constructing the point charge solutions and investigating the relation of their

the energies of the point charge solutions are innite. so, (ir) regularization is needed to calculate

them.

some worldvolume solutions of branes in a curved (brane) backgrounds are discussed for other pur-

poses in ref.[13][14][15][16][17][18]

 this is consistent with the mass formula of a (p,q) string given in ref.[19].

energies with the values of the scalar elds.

to be concrete, the background of d-branes we choose here is a 10-dimensional (10d)

massive iia supergravity background[20][21]. that is, we construct point charge solu-

tions of 10d massive iia d-branes. the massive iia supergravity[20][21] is the eld

theory limit of the 10d type iia string theory with the non-vanishing r-r 10-form eld
strength f (10)[22]. the latter together with the former are called massive iia theory.
(this massive iia supergravity has a non-vanishing cosmological constant[20][21] propor-

tional to the square of a mass parameter. so, the branes we consider are in a curved

spacetime. we note that the usual massless iia theory can be obtained from the mas-

sive iia theory by taking its massless limit.) this massive theory is very problematic in

that the covariant 11-dimensional (i.e. m-theoretic) origin of the massive iia theory has

not yet been understood completely[23] (although its non-covariant 11d origin has been

proposed[24][25]). since the solutions of 10d massive iia d-brane worldvolumes (corre-

sponding to iia branes) should have their m-theoretic origins[26][27], to investigate the

solutions is useful not only in examining the target-space covariance of the worldvolume

description, but also in exploring the m-theoretic origin of the massive theory. this is

the reason to choose the massive background.

(we will present the results about the

m-theoretic origin from the obtained solutions in the next paper.)

concrete procedures are as follows: we adopt a d-8-brane solution[28][21] as the

massive iia background of the d-branes. then, the d-8-brane has the only one transverse

space in the 10 dimensions, of course, while at least one overall transverse space is needed

after embedding another d-branes worldvolumes in order to obtain supersymmetric point

charge solutions. in the case of a d-2-brane (a d-6-brane), only the intersection with the

background d-8-brane on a string (a 5-brane) leads to the preservation of supersymmetry.

however, there is no overall transverse space in each case. a d-0-brane is not adequate

to this worldvolume description since there is no world space. so, we consider the two

cases of worldvolume theories: a d-4-brane and a d-8-brane parallel to (a subspace of)

the worldvolume of the background d-8-brane, which preserve at this moment 1/4 and

1/2 supersymmetry, respectively. in each case we construct explicitly the point charge

solution with an appropriate excitation of the only overall transverse scalar eld. we

check the consistency of the solution by discussing its massless limit. then, we introduce

a proper time of the worldvolume and calculate the energy of each solution dened with

respect to the proper time via its energy momentum tensor. the divergence of the energy

is regularized by introducing a regularization parameter. we show that the energy is

proportional to the geodesic distance from the d-brane to the point parametrized by

the value of the scalar. the coecient of the proportional relation is composed of the

3

electric charge and the d-branes tension. so, we discuss a generalized quantization

condition on the electric charge of the d-p-branes worldvolume in a curved spacetime

with the analogy of that in the at spacetime given in ref.[1]. (this is deduced from string

junction congurations by comparing their tensions with hamiltonian densities of the

worldvolume solution corresponding to them given in ref.[9].) based on this quantization

condition, we show that the coecient is really the tension of the (1,0) (i.e. a fundamental)

string. finally, we discuss preserved supersymmetry of the each solution. in the previous

paper[14] we have conrmed that the supersymmetry preserved in the solution of branes

worldvolume can be derived via superalgebras in brane backgrounds (see also [30]). so,

we use the superalgebras in a massive background via brane probes derived in ref.[29]

and show that the preserved supersymmetry of the solutions are consistent with their

target-space interpretation.

the organization of this paper is as follows: in section 2 we construct point charge

solutions of 10d massive iia d-brane worldvolumes, derive the proportional relations

of their energies with the geodesic distances and discuss their tensions. in section 3 we

present some discussion and conclusion.

before starting discussions, we present notations in this paper. we use mostly plus
metrics for both spacetime and worldvolumes, and use majorana (32 32) representation
for spinors. we denote coordinates of each p-branes worldvolume as i, j, .. (i,j,=0,1,..,p),
10-dimensional spacetime as xm, xn, .. (m,n=0,..,9), fermionic coordinates as , , .., su-
perspace as z m (= (xm, )). we use hatted letters ( m , m, ..) for all the local lorentz
frame indices and underbarred letters (m, i) for spatial indices (but not time one), respec-
tively. we denote gamma matrices as  m, which are all real and satisfy { m, n} = 2 mn.
0 is antisymmetric and others symmetric. charge conjugation is c = 0.

2 point charge solutions of 10d massive iia d-brane

worldvolumes

in this section we rst discuss a point charge solution of a d-4-brane worldvolume in a

10d massive iia background. the action takes the form[31][32]

by the superspace ns-ns 2-form gauge potential b2. c (r) are the worldvolume r-forms
induced by the superspace r-r r-form gauge potentials c (r). m is a mass parameter
which is the dual of the 10-form eld strength f (10) of a r-r 9-form c (9)[21]. tp is the
formal (but not physical) tension of the d-p-brane which is given by[31]

tp =

(2)p .

(2.3)

we take the background of the action (2.1) to be the d-8-brane solution given by[28][21]

ds2 = h /2dxdx + h 5/22dy2
e = h 5/4

c (9)

018 = h 

(2.4)

where x and x (, =0,..,8 ) are the spacetime coordinates parallel to the d-8-brane and
y is a single transverse coordinate.  is a nonzero parameter which cannot be determined

by the equations of motions of 10d massive iia supergravity. we note that the solution
(2.4) with  = 1 is the standard form of the d-8-brane solution since it is obtained via
t-duality from the other d-p-brane solutions[21]. h = h(y) is a harmonic function on

y. in this paper we set

h(y) = c1 +

m

|||y|,

(2.5)

which means that the d-8-brane lies at y = 0. we choose c1 > 0 and m > 0 to avoid a
singularity at y = 0 and to get a real dilaton. we note that the solution (2.4) becomes

the at spacetime metric in the massless limit

( m  0
c1  1 ( via dieomorphism).

(2.6)

the killing spinor of (2.4) has the form  = h /80 where 0 has a denite chirality,
i.e. y0 = +0 for y > 0 and y0 = 0 for y < 0. in this paper we concentrate the
discussions on the region y > 0.

 we choose 

 = 1 in this paper.

5

since the solutions we construct here is a bosonic one, we set fermionic coordinates 

to be zero. then, when the background is xed to (2.4), the rst three terms of the wess-

zumino term in the action (2.1) do not contribute to the equations of motion. moreover,

we consider the ansatz

xi = i
x5, x6, x7, x8 :
y = y(r) > 0
v0 = v0(r),

(i = 0, 1,   , 4)
constant

vi = 0

(2.7)



where r is dened as r  q4

i=1(i)2. we note that the upper two columns of (2.7) mean
that the d-4-brane is embedded in the 1234-hyperplane. since the spatial components of
the gauge eld vi is set to zero, the last term of the wess-zumino term does not contribute
to the equations of motion, too. then, the equations of motion we solve are

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

where lbi is the lagrangian density of the born-infend (bi) action sbi
d4.

so, let us examine more about the bi action. the induced worldvolume metric gij is

given by

gij =   h /2

0

0

h /2  [ij + h 32iyjy] ! ,

(2.11)

whose determinant is detgij = h 5/2[1 + h 32(y)2]. at this moment, the determinant
of (gij + fij) in the born-infeld action (2.1) is very complicated. however, setting the
condition

iy = iv0,

(2.12)

results in the simple form of the determinant: det(gij +fij) = h 5/2. then, the equations
of motion (2.8)(2.10) become the following two simple equations

i(h 32iy) = 0

i(h 21iy) = 0.

xi
xi

(2.13)

(2.14)

 without the condition (2.12), det(gij + fij) remains very complicated, and we cannot solve the
equations of motion at least explicitly due to their nonlinearity. furthermore, we can show that no
supersymmetry is preserved without (2.12), by using a superalgebra via brane probe appearing later
(eq.(2.49)). so, (2.12) is considered to correspond to the bps condition.

((2.13) arises from (2.9), (2.14) from the time component of (2.10), and the others are
solved.) so, requiring the two equations to be compatible, it needs to hold  = 1, and
the two are combined into one equation

i(hiy) = 0.

xi

(2.15)

we note that the harmonic function gives nontrivial contribution to (2.15), which means

that the equations of motion of the d-4-brane worldvolume are aected by the background

d-8-brane. by using (2.5) and y > 0, the equation (2.15) is written as

(i)2(y +

we choose the boundary condition

( y  y0 (> 0)
v0  0

(2.16)

(2.17)

for r  , which means that the d-4-brane lies at y = y0. then, the solution is obtained,
with the following unusual form, as

y(r) = [(

(2.18)

where c2 is a constant proportional to the electric charge of the gauge eld. the electric
charge q1 is dened as [3]

q1 = zs3

d

(2.19)

where sn is the n-sphere,  is the worldvolume hodge dual and d is the 2-form dened
by

dij =

t4

ld4
fij

where ld4 is the lagrangian density of the action sd4. then, we have

q1 = zs3

(hdv ) = mc23

(2.20)

(2.21)

where n is the volume of the unit n-sphere. we note that according to the denition
of the charge (2.19), the string coupling constant gs = e is included in the charge q1
because lbi

d4 is proportional to the inverse of gs.

 strictly speaking, our denition of the electric charge is slightly dierent from that in ref.[3].

7

before discussing the energy of the solution (2.18), we check consistency of the solution

(2.18) by discussing the massless limit of it. in the massless limit (2.6), the solution (2.18)

with (2.21) behaves as

q

2c13r2

y  y0 +
q
v0 

2c13r2 .

(2.22)

the right hand side of (2.22) is the usual point charge solution of the worldvolume theory

of a d-4-brane in the 10d at spacetime. thus, although the form of the solution (2.18)

looks unusual, we can say that it is a consistent solution.

now, we consider the energy of the solution. we calculate it by using the energy
momentum tensor of the d-4-branes worldvolume. the energy momentum tensor tij is
given as (for a review, ref.[33])

tij 
and the conservation law of tij is

1

detg

sd4
gij ,

kt k

i =

1

detg

k(t k

i qdetg) 

igkl

2

t kl = 0

(2.23)

(2.24)

where k is the covariant derivative with respect to k. let us consider the time compo-
nent of (2.24). then, since the worldvolume metric gij in this case does not depend on
the time coordinate 0, the second term vanishes. this means that the quantity

e  t 0

0qdetg.

(2.25)

is qualied as the energy density. so, we can obtain the energy of the solution by inte-
grating the energy density e over the world-space. however, this energy density has the
same transformation property as 0 under the reparametrization of 0 due to the factor
g00 in detg. in other words, the energy obtained naively from the energy density
e depends on the denition of the time 0. so, we easily see that this does not correspond
to the mass of a fundamental string, i.e. the geodesic distance multiplied by the string

tension, which is obviously not dependent on the denition of the time. so, in order to

dene the energy not dependent on the denition of the time, we introduce the proper

time  of the worldvolume as

d = q g00d0.

(2.26)

we note that  also corresponds to the proper time of the target-space in this setting since
0 is equal to the time of the target-space x0. then, the (0,0) component of the metric

8

is transformed into g 
  = 1, while the other components gij are not changed. based on
the denition of  (2.26), it holds  i = 0 for i = 1, 2, 3, 4. so, the second term of (2.24)
 g is also qualied as the energy density.
vanishes again. thus, the quantity e  = t 
since e  does not depend on the denition of the time, we use this density to dene the
energy of the solution.

the purely time component of the energy momentum tensor t 

 in this case is given

by

t 

 = h 5/4[1 + hxi

(iy)2]1/2.

so, the energy has the form

e = t4zm4

d4h 1/4[1 + h xi

(iy)2]  e1 + e2

(2.27)

(2.28)

where m4 is the world space of the d-4-brane. the energy is innite in this case, but
if we regularize it by introducing a small parameter , we can get the energy for r  .
the rst term e1 is the mass of the d-4-brane, which is proportional to the volume of
the d-4-branes world space in the target-space. the second term e2 is the energy of the
point charge solution obtained as

e2() = t4z d3z 



r3dr(c1 + my(r))5/4(iy)2

=

4t4q1

5m

[{(c1 + my0)2 +

c2
2}5/8  (c1 + my0)5/4].

(2.29)

on the other hand, the geodesic distance l from the d-4-brane (lying at y0) to the point
parametrized by y(r = ) is

l(y(); y0)  z y()

gyydy

y0
4
5

=

m1/4[(y() +

c1
m

)5/4  (y0 +

c1
m

)5/4].

so, we obtain the proportional relation:

e2() = t4q1  l(y(); y0).

(2.30)

(2.31)

therefore, we conclude that the solution (2.18) is interpreted as a fundamental string

perpendicular to both the d-4-brane and the background d-8-brane! (the string is at-

tached only to the d-4-branes worldvolume.) we note that the tension of the string is not

 we would like to thank y. imamura for pointing out my mistake in calculating the energy.

aected by the background since both the charge q1 and the tension t4 are independent
of the mass parameter m (which is determined by the background).

here, we discuss the unit electric charge for a (1,0) (fundamental) string in order to

show that the coecient of (2.31) is really the tension of a fundamental string. first, we

review the discussion about the case of electric point charge solutions of the d-p-brane in

the at spacetime given in ref.[1] (and ref.[9]). let us consider a (0,1) string (d-1-brane)
whose physical tension t(0,1) is 1/2gs. (gs is the string coupling which is constant in
this case because the background is at.) furthermore, suppose that some number n of

fundamental strings are perpendicularly absorbed in the d-1-brane at a point. this is a

triple junction of a (0,1) string, a (n,0) string and a (n,1) string. the tension of the (n,1)
string is, of course, larger than that of the (0,1) string. if the string coupling gs is small,
the tension of the (n,1) string is written as (1/gs + gsn2/2)/2. that is, it holds

t
t(0,1)

=

(gs)2n2

2

(2.32)

where t is the additional tension. on the other hand, suppose an electric point charge
q1 is added to the d-1-branes worldvolume with some excitation of one of its transverse
scalar elds. this type of worldvolume solution, corresponding to the above string junc-

tion, is given in ref.[9]. so, what one should do is to deduce the additional tension due to

the point charge from its hamiltonian density, and to compare it with (2.32). so, we also

review the solution in ref.[9]. the d-1-brane action in a 10d iib supergravity background

is

sd1 = t1z d2eqdet(gij + fij) + t1z c (2)

(2.33)

where c (2) is the worldvolume 2-form induced by the superspace r-r 2-form gauge po-
tential c2. in the at background with the ansatz that x0 = 0, x1 = 1, x9 = y(), xm =
constant for m=2,..,8, and  = 0, the action is written as

sd1 = 

t1

gs z d2q1 + (1y)2  (f01)2  (0y)2.

(2.34)

here, one should pass to the hamiltonian formalism because the hamiltonian density
corresponds to the tension. the canonical momenta of y9 and v1, respectively, are

p =

1 =

t10y

q1 + (1y)2  h(f01)2  (0y)2
q1 + (1y)2  (f01)2  (0y)2

t1f01

.

10

(2.35)

by using their canonical relations, one can construct a hamiltonian, whose density h has
the form

h = t1q(1 + (1y)2)(1 + (t1)2p 2) + (t1)2(1)2 + (t1)2(11y)2.

(2.36)

(moreover, one can set the constraint 11 = 0.) setting a (static) gauge vi = 0, 0y =
0v0 = 0 with the bps condition 1v0 = 1y, the equations of motion are reduced to

(1)2v0 = 0.

moreover, in this case the hamiltonian density is factorized as

h = t1q(1 + (1y)2)(1 + (t1)2(1)2).

(2.37)

(2.38)

the solution of the d-1-branes worldvolume as the triple string junction with an electric
charge q1 is[9]

y(1) = v0(1) = ( q11

0

for 1 > 0
for 1 < 0.

(2.39)

the geometrical interpretation of this solution is that at the point x1 = x9 = 0 where the
(0,1) string intersecting with the (n,0) string, the initially straight (0,1) string is bent by
angle  to the negative x9, where tan  = q1. then, the energy of the (n,1) string is given
as

e(n,1) =

t1

gs z 

0

d1q(1 + (1y)2)(1 + (f01)2).

(2.40)

however, this does not directly correspond to the tension of the the (n,1) string, because
the (n,1) string is bent rigidly by angle  relative to the x1(= 1) axis. so, introducing
a proper world sheet coordinate  along to the direction which the (n,1) string prongs,
one should measure the tension with respect to . in this case it holds 1 =  cos  where

cos  = 1/q1 + (q1)2 = 1/q(1 + (1y)2). thus, one can see that only the excitation of f01

(but not that of the scalar eld x9) contributes to the additional tension t . in the weak
eld limit, the additional tension t due to the eld strength f01 is (1/2gs)(f01)2/2,
that is, the ratio of t to the tension of the (0,1) string is t /t(0,1) = (1/2)(f01)2.
comparing this with the equation (2.32), the charge quantization condition f01 = q1 =
gsn is deduced for a point charge q1. (in this case it is a kind of domain wall solution. so,
no integration over the world-space is needed to get the charge q1 from the eld strength.)
in other words, it is shown that adding an electric point charge q1 = g to the d-string
corresponds to attaching a (1,0) fundamental string to it. by t-dualizing with respect to

11

the directions of xm for m=2,..,8, the charge quantization condition for a electric point
charge q1 of the d-p-branes worldvolume is shown to be

q1 

1

(2)p1 zsp1

f0r = gsn.

(2.41)

next, we consider the case which is related by t-duality to our case: the d-4-brane

parallel to a subspace of the worldvolume of a d-8-brane background. so, suppose a d-1-

brane parallel to a subspace of the worldvolume of a d-5-brane background, and that some

number n of fundamental strings are absorbed in the d-1-brane. this is a triple string

junction of a (0,1) string, a (1,0) string and a (n,1) string in the d-5-brane background.

we note that this is also a bps conguration since 1/8 spacetime supersymmetry is

preserved. (1/4 supersymmetry is preserved in the conguration of a (0,1) string parallel

to a subspace of a d-5-brane, and 1/8 supersymmetry is still preserved after adding a

(1,0) string intersecting orthogonally to both branes. finally, the third (n,1) string does

not break any of the 1/8 supersymmetry according to ref.[34].) the d-5-brane background

solution is

ds2 = h 1/2dxdx + h 1/2dyadybab
e = h 1/2

c (6)

015 = h 1

(2.42)

where h is a harmonic function on the coordinates ya (a = 6, .., 9), which are transverse
to the d-5-brane. the string coupling gs in this case is a local function on ya (gs = h 1/2)
because the dilaton  depends on them. this means that the physical tension of this

(n,1) string is also a local function. if the test d-1-brane is put near the d-5-brane,
the string coupling gs is considered to be suciently small around the d-1-brane. so, the
equation (2.32) with gs = h 1/2 holds on the basis of the same discussion. on the other
hand, suppose that a electric point charge q
1 is added to the d-1-branes worldvolume
with an excitation of a scalar eld y9. then, (the bosonic sector of) the d-1-brane action
in the background (2.42) is

sd1 = t1z d2q1 + h(1y9)2  h(f01)2  h(0y9)2.

the canonical momenta of y9 and v1, respectively, are

p =

1 =

t1h0y9

q1 + h(1y9)2  h(f01)2  h(0y9)2
q1 + h(1y9)2  h(f01)2  h(0y9)2

t1hf01

.

(2.43)

(2.44)

using their canonical relations, we can construct a hamiltonian density h as
h = t1q(1 + h(1y9)2)(1 + (t1)2h 1p 2) + (t1)2h 1(1)2 + (t1)2(11y9)2.(2.45)

(we set the constraint 11 = 0.) by the analogy with the case of the string junction
stated above, only the eld strength f01 is considered to contribute to the additional
tension. so, in the weak eld limit, we can see from the hamiltonian density (2.45), that

the additional tension due to the eld strength satises

t
t(0,1)

=

1

2(t1)2  h 1(1)2 =

1
2  h(f01)2.

(2.46)

so, comparing this with (2.32) we have the charge quantization condition h 1/2f01 = ngs
for a integer n. since in this case gs is a certain local function.
it should rather be
written as h 1/2f01/gs = n. this does not seem to be a universal form, however, by using
the the electric induction d01 =  1
(= hf01 in this case) it can be written
generically as

t1  ld1

f01

d01 = n.

(2.47)

the higher dimensional d-brane cases are related to (2.47) by t-dualities. (we note that

the background elds should be transformed simultaneously by t-dualities.) so, we have

1

(2)p1 zsp1

d0r = n.

(2.48)

for the point charge of the d-p-brane parallel to a p-dimensional subspace of the world-

volume of the d-(p+4)-brane background. we propose that this is the generalized charge

quantization condition on the electric ux of the d-branes (corresponding to a funda-

mental string) in curved spacetimes. in the case of p = 4, the left hand side of (2.48)
is equivalent to the charge q1 of the solution (2.18) multiplied by 1/(2)3. so, if (2.48)
holds, the unit charge q1 for a (1,0) string is q1 = (2)3. so, remembering t4 = 1/(2)4,
the coecient of the proportional relation (2.31) is shown to be t4q1 = 1
2 . so, the string
tension is reproduced correctly. (in other words, the proposed generalized charge quan-

tization condition (2.48) is consistent.) on the basis of the interpretation, the solution

corresponds to the following intersection of three branes:

background d8:

 in fact, we cannot construct explicitly the solution of the equations of motion of the action (2.43)
9. however, this conguration

unless the harmonic function is assumed to depend only on the coordinate y
does exist as a bps state, and if we assume the existence of some eld strength, (2.46) holds for it.

as a nal discussion of the d-4-brane case, we consider the preserved supersymmetry

of the solution. on the basis of the above interpretation, 1/8 supersymmetry is expected

to be preserved. we show this by using superalgebras in brane backgrounds via brane

probes given in ref.[30][29][14]

the superalgebra in a d-8 brane background via a d-4-brane probe is given in ref.

since the three gamma matrix products y,c123411 and cy11 (arising in (2.50)) com-
mute with each other, all of them can be simultaneously diagonalized. since the square

of each matrix product is equal to the identity and each is traceless, both of the matrices
1+c123411

are projection operators. so, we conclude that the solution has

1/8 supersymmetry.

as another case of the massive iia d-brane, we consider a d-8-brane in the massive

iia background (2.4). the action is

sd8 = sbi

d8 = t8z d9eqdet(gij + fij)

d8 + sw z
+t8z ( c (r)ef|9form +

v (dv )4)).

(2.51)

in this case, we consider the ansatz

xi = i
y = y(r)(> 0)
v0 = v0(r),

(i = 0, 1,   , 8)
vi = 0.




where r is dened as r  qp8

i=1(i)2. the rst column means that the d-8-brane is
embedded parallel to the background d-8-brane. then, combined with  = 0, only the
term including c (9) of the wess-zumino action do contribute to the equations of motion

14

( c (9)
01..8 = h ). the expression of the induced worldvolume metric gij is the same as (2.11)
except for the range of the indices (in this case i, j = 1, 2, .., 8). setting the same condition
as (2.12) makes the determinant of (gij +fij) simple, such as det(gij +fij) = h 9/2. then,
we nd the equations of motion

i(h 22iy) = 0

i(h 1iy) = 0.

(2.52)

(2.53)

thus, these two equations are compatible only if  = 1 (which is the same condition as
that in the d-4-brane case). the equations to solve become a single equation

(i)2y = 0.

xi

(2.54)

unlike the d-4-brane case, the harmonic function h does not appear in (2.54). that

is, the solution in this case is not aected by the background. so, choosing the same

boundary condition as (2.17), the solution is obtained easily, as

27.

(2.56)

we note that the form of this point charge solution (2.55) is completely the same as the

usual point charge solution of the d-8-brane worldvolume in the at background.

next, we calculate the energy of the solution (2.55). for the same reason as the case

of the d-4-brane worldvolume, we introduce the proper time  as (2.26) and dene the

energy with respect to it again. then, the energy is given as

e()  zm8

t 

 qg = t8zm8

d8[h 3/4 + h 1/4(iy)2]  e

(2.57)

where m8 is the world space of the d-8-brane (but not that of the background d-8-brane).
the rst term e
1 is the mass of the d-8-brane, which is proportional to the volume of
the d-8-branes world space in the target-space. the second term e
2, the energy of the
point charge solution, is obtained as

r7dr(c1 + my(r))1/4(iy)2

e

2() = t8z d7z 



= t8q

1  l(y(); y0)
15

(2.58)

where l(y(); y0) is the geodesic distance from the d-8-brane lying at y0 to the point
parametrized by y(r = ), dened in the same way as (2.30). so, we conclude that the

solution also corresponds to a fundamental string perpendicular to the two d-8-branes

(though the string is attached only to the one of them).

here, we derive the unit electric charge for a (1,0) string in the same way as the

case of the d-4-brane worldvolume. suppose a test d-1-brane parallel to a d-1-brane

background. if some number n of fundamental strings are perpendicularly attached to the

test d-1-brane, this corresponds to the same string junction as the previous cases though

the background in this case is the d-1-brane. in the d-1-brane background, the string
coupling is given as gs = e = h 1/2 where h is a harmonic function on the coordinates
transverse to the d-1-brane. we assume that the string coupling gs is suciently small
in almost all region of the target-space (or we put the test d-1-brane to such region.)

then, (2.32) is deduced in the same way. on the other hand, suppose that a electric point
1 is added to the d-1-branes worldvolume with an excitation of a scalar eld y9.
charge q
then, the d-1-brane action is

sd1 = t1z d2[h 1q1 + h(1y9)2  h(f01)2  h(0y9)2  h 1]

(2.59)

where the last term comes from the wess-zumino term. the canonical momenta of y9
and v1, respectively, are

p =

1 =

t10y9

q1 + h(1y9)2  h(f01)2  h(0y9)2
q1 + h(1y9)2  h(f01)2  h(0y9)2

t1f01

.

(2.60)

by using their canonical relations, we can construct a hamiltonian density h
h = t1hq(1 + h(1y9)2)(1 + (t1)2hp 2) + (t1)2h(1)2 + (t1)2h 2(11y9)2
t1h.

(2.61)

so, in the weak eld limit, we can see that the additional tension due to the eld strength

satises

t

2(t1)2 h(1)2 =

h(f01)2.

(2.62)

comparing this with (2.32), we have the charge quantization condition h 1/2f01 = ngs =
nh 1/2 for a integer n (i.e. f01 = n). by using the electric induction d01 =  1
=
f01, it is also rewritten as the equation (2.47). by t-duality, the same charge quantization

condition as (2.48) is obtained for the point charge of the d-p-brane parallel to the d-p-

brane background. in the case of p = 8, the left hand side of (2.48) is equivalent to the
1 of the solution (2.55) multiplied by 1/(2)7. thus, the string tension tf = 1
charge q
2
can be correctly obtained again. we note that the energy of the solution is proportional

not to the dierence but to the geodesic distance, although the form of the solution is the
same as that in the at background. the dierence comes from the value of g00 (in this
case g00 6= 1). on the basis of the interpretation, the solution (2.55) corresponds to the
following intersection of three branes:

background d8:

finally, we derive the preserved supersymmetry of the solution (2.55) in the same

way. based on the above spacetime interpretation, 1/4 supersymmetry is expected to be

preserved. the superalgebra in a d-8 brane background via a d-8-brane probe is[29]

(2.65)

for the same reason stated in the discussion of the supersymmetry preserved in the d-

4-brane case, (2.65) means that 1/4 supersymmetry is preserved in this conguration,

which is consistent with the spacetime interpretation.

3 discussion and conclusion

in summary, in this paper we have investigated the worldvolume action of a d-4-brane

and a d-8-brane parallel to the background d-8-brane, and obtained explicitly supersym-

metric point charge solutions of the worldvolume gauge elds with appropriate excitations

17

of the only overall transverse scalar elds. we have shown that the regularized energies

of the solutions, dened with respect to the proper time, are proportional to the geodesic

distances from the d-branes to the points parametrized by the regularized values of the

scalar elds. the coecients are shown to be the tension of a fundamental string by

using the generalized quantization condition on the electric ux of the d-p-brane. their

preserved supersymmetry are deduced consistently. so, we conclude that these solutions

correspond to fundamental strings ending on the d-branes worldvolumes. an interesting

thing among these results is that obtained solutions can be constructed only if the undeter-
mined parameter  of the d-8-brane solution is xed to 1, where the d-8-brane solution
is related to the other d-brane solutions via t-dualities.

finally, we consider the implication of the results obtained above, by discussing the d-

4-brane case in particular, in which the solution has a unusual form. in the massless limit,

the solution of the unusual form approaches to the usual point charge solution of the d-
brane in the 10d at spacetime, while keeping the proportional relation e2 = tf  l, where
l is the geodesic distance, i.e. target-space covariant quantity. so, it is concluded that the

unusual form of the solution (corresponding to string) originates from the requirement for

the solution to have such target-space covariance. in other words, we can say that the

way of describing one of intersecting branes as a worldvolume solution of another brane

has nontrivial target-space covariance.
