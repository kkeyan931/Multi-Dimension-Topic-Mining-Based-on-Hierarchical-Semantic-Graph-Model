the niteness requirement for euclidean einstein gravity is shown

1 introduction

in a recent note by one of us[1] it was shown, by using an old result of lich-
nerowicz, that the only positive denite (riemannian, often called euclidean)4-
metrics for which the integrated two loop counterterms of pure einstein grav-
ity vanish are at. this is in contrast with lorentzian 4-metrics, some of
which may have all counterterms vanishing pointwise without being at.

in fact in four dimensions, given the vanishing of the ricci tensor, the
one loop counterterm is the local integrand in the gauss-bonnet expression
for the euler number and is proportional to the square of the riemann cur-
vature tensor. thus, as long as the metric is positive denite, already at one
loop, the counterterm can only vanish if the metric is at. for a lorentzian
pp-wave metric however the square of the riemann tensor necessarily van-
ishes. note that although the integrand is locally a total derivative it is not
the divergence of a covariant vector eld and thus it cannot be disregarded
as a counterterm. it denitely contributes around non-trivial backgrounds.
however, in view of its topological nature, one might imagine absorbing this
divergence by renormalizing a topological coupling constant. the new result
at two loops then tells us that even disregarding the one loop divergence
there are no non-at two-loop nite metrics in pure gravity for which the
integrated counterterm vanishes. in this paper we shall discuss the situation
in six dimensions at one-loop.

by contrast with the case of four dimensions, the one loop counterterm
is not purely topological, although it contains a contribution proportional to
the local integrand of the gauss-bonnet theorem (also called the euler term),
there are extra terms. another dierence is that the divergence identity of
lichnerowicz comes in at one loop rather than two loops as it does in four
dimensions. our nal result is nevertheless similar to that in four dimensions:
the integrated extra terms can only vanish in a at background. however,
as we shall see, this does not seem to preclude a possible cancellation of the
extra terms against the euler number. we will examine the exceptional case
separately.

2

before embarking on the calculations, we wish to expand on some of the
motivations for this work. in the past few years particular solutions of the
equations of the classical equations of motion of gravity and super-gravity
theories have been extensively used to investigate the quantum properties
of string theory and m-theory. the best known examples are so-called bps
solutions, i.e.
those admitting killing spinors. because of the supersym-
metry many, but not all bps solutions are believed to suer no quantum
corrections and so the properties of those classical solutions should persist at
the quantum level. typically the reasons for believing that quantum correc-
tions vanish are so called non-renormalization theorems which are based
on the pointwise vanishing of counterterms on these backgrounds. an ex-
ample is provided by self-dual solutions of the euclidean einstein equations,
considered as solutions of n = 1 supergravity theories. of course n = 1
supergravity is not generally believed to be a consistent quantum theory of
gravity, but is believed to be a consistent low-energy approximation to string
theory. thus one has some condence that some of the properties of these
classical solutions will persist in the full quantum theory.

another example is provided by pp-waves of the lorentzian vacuum ein-
stein equations. these certainly admit killing spinors and are hence bps,
but they also possess another very striking property: all invariants formed
from the curvature tensor vanish. in fact because of the structure of the cur-
vature tensor, it seems likely that the pp-waves will be solutions of almost
any set of covariant eld equation (obtained possibly by taking the variation
of some eective action) without a cosmological term of the form

rab = sab(gab, rabcd, rabcd;c . . .),

(1)

where sab is a trace free tensor constructed from the metric, the curvature
tensor and its covariant derivatives. physically pp-waves represent gravi-
tational waves and from the above it would seem that we can be pretty
condent that gravitational wave solutions of some eective action in the
quantum theory behave very much like gravitational wave solutions in the
classical theory. in particular we expect no modication of their properties
as they propagate freely through empty spacetime[2, 3]. in the case of pp-
waves we were not using any particular form of the eective action, just the
vanishing of the invariants and the variational derivatives with respect to the
metric.

3

another, slightly more trivial example of metrics whose properties will be
essentially unchanged, up to a scale, by quantum eects is provided by spaces
of constant curvature, i.e. anti-de-sitter and de-sitter spacetime. substitut-
ing the expression rabcd = c(gacgbd  gadgbc) into the eective equations of
motion (1) but where now sab is no longer trace free, gives an equation for
the constant c which generically will have a number of real solutions.
in
fact the quantum corrections in this case will merely shift the radius form its
classical value. because of the very simple structure of their curvature ten-
sors, anti-de-sitter space and de-sitter space are examples of what one might
call universal solutions. this concept is close to bleeckers idea of critical
metrics in riemannian geometry [4, 5]. these are metrics which are critical
points of any dieomorphism invariant action functional constructed from
the metric and its derivatives. in that case he showed that critical metrics
are homogenous spaces m = g/h where h acts irreducibly on the tangent
space.

it is clearly desirable to discover as many of these privileged classes of
metrics as possible. they obviously do not exhaust all possibly relevant solu-
tions of the eective equations of motion, but they are ones whose properties
we can be fairly condent of. in general we can only hope to nd solutions of
the ective equations of motion in some sort of perturbation series whereas
the solutions we are seeking are classically exact. thus the search for them
is analogous to the search for exact solutions in classical general relativity
but our criterion is more stringent.

in the lorentzian case there seem to be a number of other examples in
addition to those already mentioned, for instance pp-waves moving in anti-
de-sitter spacetime [6, 7] are very likely critical or universal. in addition
there exist some four-dimensional lorentzian spacetimes of petrov type n
and iii which have all invariants vanishing 1 [1]. in the riemannian case, the
set of critical metrics is from bleeckers results, rather small. thus one may
relax it to demanding that integrals of some or all invariants vanish. in four
dimensions at cubic order in the curvature tensor, i.e. at two loops, there
is only one invariant which is not a total derivative available. it was shown
that, among ricci at metrics, the integral can vanish only in the trivial at
case. in particular the integral is non-vanishing for self-dual spaces. because

1of course the vanishing of the invariants does not by itself mean that their variational
derivatives vanish but it does mean that the integrals of the counterterms vanish identically.

4

only one invariant is available in this case, it must correspond to the local
counterterm of any two loop non-nite theory of gravity, such as einstein
gravity. we deduce that the quantum niteness of self-dual spaces depends
in an essential way on embedding them in a supersymmetric theory.

in this paper we shall be concerned with the six-dimensional case. as
indicated above this is more complicated. it is nevertheless of considerable
physical interest. firstly, in superstring compactications one has a six-
dimensional ricci at internal space which is usually taken to be a calabi-
yau space. this admits covariantly constant spinors and is a supersymmetric
solution of the low-energy supergravity approximation to string theory. sec-
ondly such spaces play a role in the theory of the m-5-brane ( see e.g.
[8])
where one considers the conformal counterterms associated with the (2,0)
tensor multiplet.

the plan of the paper is as follows. in section 2 we shall, for the con-
venience of the reader, recall the essential deatils of the four-dimensional
case. in section 3 we discuss the six-dimensional case. section 4 contains a
discussion and a conclusion.

2 4 dimensional euclidean gravity

let us rst recall the case of four dimensional pure einstein gravity with a
positive denite (euclidean) metric [1]. the action is

1


l =

gr ,

(2)

where  and r are the gravitational constant and the riemann scalar cur-
vature. their physical dimensions are [] = {m(ass)}2 and [r] = m2 re-
spectively. in perturbative quantum gravity, the original lagrangian must
be shifted as l + l1-loop + l2-loop +  , in order to subtract ultraviolet
divergences. the most general 1-loop counter lagrangian, not neglecting the
total derivative terms 2 , may be written as

l1-loop = a2r + b1r2 + b2rabrab + b3rabcdrabcd

.

(3)

2 in many conventional treatments of counterterms, total derivatives and the euler
term are ignored[9]. here we keep them in order to know how the requirement of niteness
constrains the global and asymptotic behavior of the spacetime manifold.

5

the 4 terms above are locally independent and the complete list of general
invariants with the dimension of m4.
3 here we introduce a convenient
graphical representation[13] for these invariants which facilitates algebraic
manipulations, especially for the extension to the higher orders and to the
higher dimension.

2r =

, r2 =

rabrab =

.

(4)

among the 4 invariants above, two special combinations are well known: the
euler term (e) and the conformal invariant (c).

conformal invariant c =

euler term e = r2  4rabrab + rabcdrabcd
r2  2rabrab + rabcdrabcd

now we consider ricci at (rf) manifolds:

rab = 0.

the quantities above reduce to

,

.

(5)

(6)

l1-loop|rf = b3

, e|rf = c|rf =

.

(7)

thus the requirement of ricci at (on-shell) niteness leads to (assuming
b3 6= 0)

z g

= z grabcdrabcd = 0

.

this means, in the euclidean metric, that the geometry is locally at:

rabcd = 0

.

(8)

(9)

3 if we identify 1-loop counterterm with the trace anomaly, then the possible terms
reduce to the following three [10, 11, 12] : e(euler term),c(conformal invariant) and
2r(trivial term).

6

consequently this says e and c locally vanish.

in particular the euler

number vanishes: r ge|rf = 0.

one might wonder whether this result is an accidental due to the simplic-
ity of the 1-loop terms or the special nature of the 4 dimensions one 1-loop
counterterm, which is proportional to the euler term for a ricci at mani-
fold. therefore let us examine the 2-loop terms. the most general form of
the 2-loop counterterm, including total derivatives, can be expressed as some
linear combination of the following 15 terms.

we consider a regular manifold on which the total integral of total deriva-
tives vanish. then the requirement of 2-loop niteness reduces to, assuming
 w

3 + y3  z3 6= 0,

z go3 = z g(erabcd)2 = 0 .

this means, in the case of a euclidean metric,

using this result, we obtain

erabcd = 0 .

in the asymptotically locally at (alf) or asymptotically locally euclidean
(ale) case, (18) imply

(19)

which means again (9).

we claim that to require niteness is to require a locally at metric (9)
in 4 dim euclidean pure einstein gravity. we have shown this for 1-loop
and 2-loop orders. it would be quite interesting if one could prove the same
result for higher orders. the key point for such an extension would be a
generalization of the lichnerowicz identity to general invariants with higher
dimensions as shown in fig.1.

3 6 dimensional euclidean gravity

besides the higher loop order situation, the higher dimensional extension is
also interesting. let us consider 6 dim pure einstein gravity with a euclidean
metric.

we shall assume that the boundary terms of genuinely covariant divergence
identities vanish. however even if we do so, we cannot assume in general
that the integral of the gauss-bonnet integrand vanishes. we notice here
a delicate thing appers: an analogous one appeared at 1-loop for 4 dim
gravity. in order to clearly look at the things which are independent of the
euler number contribution, we treat the following two cases separately.

case a :

case b :

z d6xge|rf = 0 ,
z d6xge|rf 6= 0 .

see footnote below 6.

case a

in this case, with the assumption:  1

6 (2w1 + w2) + y3  z3 6= 0, the 1-
loop niteness requirement (27) again reduces to (16). because the results
of (17-19) hold true for 6 dim, we conclude that the requirement of (1-loop)
niteness again means (9) that the metric is locally at.

if our manifold is compact then (28) implies that the euler characteristic
vanishes. in four dimensions the ricci-at condition would then force the

the 1-loop niteness. vanishing of the volume integral of the boundary terms is required
at 2-loop level.

metric to be at. in six dimensions closed ricci at, non-at manifolds may
have vanishing euler number. the product of a two dimensional torus with
a k3 surface is an example. if the six-manifold is not closed then there will
in general be boundary contributions to the gauss-bonnet formula and (28)
does not necessarily imply the vanishing of the euler number.

case b

in case b, the euler number contribution cancels against the remaining

contribution.

first we should note that the two coecients, in front of above two terms, are
determined by the ultraviolet structure of the quantum gravity. while the

integral of the the gauss-bonnet term, r d6xge|rf , is determined by the
topology of the background space manifold. therefore, assuming 4w1 w2 6=
0,  1
6 (2w1+w2)+y3z3 6= 0, the above equation requires the volume integral
of a local quantity, r d6xgo3, is determined only by the local quantum
if such a
structure and the global structure of the background manifold.
metric consistently exists, it must be a very special one ( which describes
something like a boundary theory ).

4 discussion and conclusion

the coecients of the counterterms in 6 dim pure einstein gravity (with
lorentzian metric) was obtained by p.van nieuwenhuizen[16] and by
r. critchley[17]. they focused on a1 ( not on o3 as in the present anal-
ysis). the ricci at counter lagrangian (26) can also be expressed as

.

|rf = (w1 +

1
2

(31)

4315120 . note that this co-
they obtained the coecient in front of a1 as
ecient is proportional to the previous one in front of o3 and it shows the

9

11

non-zero assumption taken there holds true. in their derivation, in eect, the
lichnerowicz identity was used. in the eq.(63) of ref.[17], the top equation
corresponds to the identity (25), the middle one to (13), and the bottom to
the rst equation of (24). (x and y, in their notation, correspond to a1
and b1 respectively.)
the approach to the niteness of the quatum gravity taken in [1] and the
present paper should be distinguished from the ordinary one taken so far.
ordinarily, beginning from the t hooft and veltmans analysis[9], the focus
is mainly on the cancellation between coecients of counterterms, where care
is not taken so much for the background (metric) eld except that it satis-
es the eld equation. in the ordinary approach, the supergravity theories
realize the niteness requirement to some extent. the 1-loop cancellation in
some theories is reviewed in [18] from the view of the weyl anomaly. infor-
mation about the counterterms for scalars, spinors and vectors is given in
[19]. quite recently the conformal anomaly in the free d=6 superconformal
(2,0) tensor multiplet theory on the curved background has been computed
[8]. (they compare the result with that of ads/cft. some discrepancy ( for
the euler term) appears and they say the free tensor multiplet anomaly does
not vanish on the ricci at manifold.) the present approach, by contrast,
focuses on the background metric eld itself rather than on the coecients.
instead of seeking the cancellation among coecients, the constraints on the
metric eld which are induced from the niteness requirement are examined.
the standpoint is that the quantum structure can constrain the eective
background eld. our observation is that the niteness requirement in the
present approach is so stringent, in euclidean case, that the at space is only
allowed (except a special case).
