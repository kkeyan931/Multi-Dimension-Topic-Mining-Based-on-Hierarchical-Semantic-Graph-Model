abstract

we address problems associated with compactication near and on the light
front. in perturbative scalar eld theory we illustrate and clarify the relation-
ships among three approaches: (1) quantization on a space-like surface close
to a light front; (2) innite momentum frame calculations; and (3) quantiza-
tion on the light front. our examples emphasize the dierence between zero
modes in space-like quantization and those in light front quantization.
in
particular, in perturbative calculations of scalar eld theory using discretized
light cone quantization there are well-known new zero mode induced inter-
action terms. however, we show that they decouple in the continuum limit
and covariant answers are reproduced. thus compactication of a light-like
surface is feasible and denes a consistent eld theory.

i. introduction

problems pertaining to compactication near and on the light front have been presented
and explored recently in the context of perturbative scalar eld theory [1]. in the formalism
of compactication near the light front certain divergences were found in the one loop scat-
tering amplitude in scalar eld theory at nite box length as one tried to approach the light
front. these divergences were presumed to be caused by the longitudinal zero momentum
modes in the light front theory.

zero modes on the light front have a long history [24]. for certain eld theories, they
are invoked to account for the non-trivial vacuum structure. in order to isolate the zero
mode, one puts the system in a longitudinal box and imposes boundary conditions. this
procedure is popularly known as discretized light cone quantization [5] (dlcq). in dlcq
scalar eld theory with periodic boundary conditions, the zero modes are constrained and
they have to be determined in terms of the non-zero modes by solving a nonlinear operator
equation. thus the zero mode in scalar light front theory is quite dierent from the zero
mode in equal time theory where it is a dynamical mode just as any non-zero mode. it is
important to keep this distinction in mind.

1

since zero modes pose a major challenge in the nonperturbative context, attempts have
been made to perform the quantization on a space like surface [6] close to the light front (a
parameter  characterizes the closeness). by taking   0 one is supposed to reach the
light front surface. however, this limiting procedure need not be smooth since a light front
surface cannot be reached from a space-like surface by a nite lorentz transformation. on
the other hand, s-matrix elements should be independent of  for any value of  since this
parameterization simply labels dierent space-like surfaces. thus any  dependence in an
s-matrix element signals breakdown of lorentz invariance as in the results of ref. [1].

l k and p  = l

k.

let

let us recall the major dierences between the discretized versions of near light front
theory and light front theory. we shall restrict the longitudinal coordinate x (x = x0x3)
to a nite interval while keeping two transverse coordinates unbounded. to avoid confusion,
we shall denote the light front box length by l and the near light front box length by let.
in order to check lorentz invariance one has to perform the continuum limit of dlcq.
let us consider the mass operator m 2 = p +p   (p )2, where p +, p  are the light-
front momentum and energy operators and p   (p 1, p 2). in dlcq one can introduce
p + = 2
2 h. the semi positive denite operator k, the harmonic resolution,
is dimensionless momentum and h, the hamiltonian, has the dimension of m 2. in dlcq
the mass operator is given by m 2 = kh  (p )2. the box length l has disappeared
from the operator. eigenvalues of k represent the total momentum of the system. the
continuum limit is given by k  . this is to be contrasted with the near light front
discretization where the box length does not disappear from the mass operator. also the
momentum operator is not semi positive denite. nevertheless for the ease of comparisons,
let us denote the total dimensionless momentum in the near light front case by k. the
longitudinal momentum p in this case can take both positive and negative values and we
can put only | p |= 2
the innite momentum frame [7,8] is a concept that allows one to simulate perturbative
light front theory calculations in an equal time framework by taking the external total longi-
tudinal momentum to innity. in scalar eld theory the equivalence holds even beyond tree
level (except for vacuum diagrams). for theories involving fermions the equivalence clearly
breaks down beyond tree level [9,10]. in scalar eld theory, in the discretized version, one
can ask whether one can simulate dlcq perturbation theory by considering the innite mo-
mentum frame starting from the equal time formulation. obviously this cannot be achieved
by taking k very large since that should correspond to the continuum limit of dlcq. one
choice is to take let  0 since this can simulate innite momentum for non-zero modes.
then one can ask the question whether let drops out of scattering amplitudes and if they in
turn approach dlcq scattering amplitudes. of course by taking let  0 we have moved as
far away from the continuum limit as possible and if we nd lorentz non-invariant answers
we should not be surprised. another choice is to discretize the near light front theory, let
  0 and see whether let dependence drops out (characteristic of the dlcq formalism).
at nite , l   readily reproduces covariant answers, but at nite l,   0 produces
divergent answers. from this one cannot conclude anything about dlcq since lorentz
invariance is broken. note that in the discretized near light front formulation, where modes
are specied by integers n, the expression n
 , encountered in [1], presents for the zero mode
(n = 0) a 0

0 problem for   0 which means that the limit is undened.

to the best of our knowledge, various issues that are raised above have not been resolved

2

in a clear and satisfactory manner. towards this goal, we perform and compare perturbative
calculations for scalar eld theory in the continuum and discretized versions of three formu-
lations, namely, light front quantization, innite momentum limit of equal time quantization
and space-like quantization parameterized by . as examples we consider the self-energy
diagram in 3 theory and the scattering diagram in 4 theory.

the plan of this paper is as follows. in sec. ii we discuss the results in the continuum
light front theory. in sec. iii the corresponding dlcq results are presented. in sec. iv
the results in space like quantization characterized by  are given in the continuum and
the discretized versions. corresponding results in the innite momentum limit of equal
time theory are given in sec. v. sec. vi contains our summary and conclusions. since it is
unfamiliar to most readers, a brief introduction to the space-like quantization parameterized
by  is given in appendix a.

ii. light front perturbation theory  continuum

formulation

in this section we compare results of the light front perturbation theory with those of the
covariant perturbation theory, both in continuum formulation. we consider the self-energy
diagram in 

3! 3 theory and the scattering diagram in 

4! 4 theory.

a. self-energy in 

3! 3 theory

consider the one loop self-energy diagram in 3 theory. note that in this case there is
only one time ordered diagram (fig. 1a) in the light front case. using the rules of light
front old fashioned perturbation theory [11] we have

(p2) =

the factor 1/2 is a symmetry factor. introducing y = q+/p+, we get

y(1  y)p2  (q)2  m2 + i

(2.1)

(2.2)

with p2 = p+p  (p)2.

note that the integrand is nonsingular at y = 0.
next we derive this result starting from the feynman diagram. the corresponding am-

plitude (fig. 2) is

 i(p2) =

(2.4)

let us now perform the k integration. let p+ > 0. for k+ > 0, p+ + k+ > 0, both poles
are in the lower half of the complex k plane. we can close the contour in the upper half
plane and the integral is zero. for k+ < 0, if p+ < k+, p+ + k+ < 0, both poles are in the
upper half plane. we can close the contour in the lower half plane and the integral again is
zero. for p+ > 0, we get a non-vanishing contribution when k+ < 0 and k+ > p+. then,
closing the contour in the upper half plane, we get

(2.6)

we recover the expression (eq. (2.1)) from old fashioned perturbation theory with energy
denominator and integration over three momentum.

b. one loop scattering in 

4! 4 theory

next consider the scattering amplitude at one loop level in 4 theory. p1, p2 are the initial
momenta and p3, p4 are the nal momenta. let us denote s = (p1 + p2)2 and t = (p1  p3)2.
in the light front perturbation theory, we have to consider two cases separately.

iii. light front perturbation theory  discretized

formulation

light front quantization in a nite volume with periodic elds (dlcq) has some concep-
tual advantages. first of all, it allows one to work explicitly with fourier modes of quantum
elds, carrying vanishing light front momentum p+  the zero modes (zm). while in the
case of gauge elds some zm are dynamically independent, zm of scalar elds are always
dependent (constrained) variables, as follows from the structure of the equations of motion,
containing  = 4+  2
  ii, i = 1, 2. due to periodic boundary conditions
1 in x and x  (x1, x2) (l  x  l,l  x  l), the full scalar eld can be
decomposed as (x) = 0(x+, x) + n(x+, x), where x  (x, x). the mode expansion for
the normal-mode eld n(x) is

it contains zm terms, which have to be expressed by means of the normal-mode eld n(x).
to do so we need to obtain the lowest-order solution of the zm constraint. the latter is
simply the zm projection of the equation of motion

where the second term comes from the normal ordering. this term will be neglected hence-
forth because it generates divergent terms in the hamiltonian, which are presumably a
manifestation of the well known pathology of the 3 theory (no lower bound of the en-
ergy). indeed, in the case of the 4 interaction, the constrained zero mode is expressed
automatically as a normal-ordered product of creation and annihilation operators without
a c-number piece.

the interacting hamiltonian p

continuum formulation, plus the zm term, calculated to o(2):

the continuum-limit invariant scattering amplitude mf i, extracted from (3.19), coincides
with the covariant answer (2.9). it follows that for consistency the zm contribution has to
vanish in the continuum limit. that this is indeed the case can be checked in the rst-order
perturbation theory. in the fock representation, part of the zm hamiltonian relevant for

the analysis proceeds as in the case of i (p2). we get a non-vanishing contribution which
matches the light front perturbation theory answer. for eon(p1) < eon(p3), i.e., p3 >
p1, the analysis proceeds as in the case of ii(p2) and the contribution vanishes as 2.

next consider mf i(ii) (fig. 3b). for eon(p1) > eon(p3), i.e., p3 < p1, the analysis
proceeds as in the case of ii(p2) and the contribution vanishes. for the case eon(p1) <
eon(p3), i.e., p3 > p1, the analysis proceeds as in the case of i (p2) and we get a non-
vanishing contribution that agrees with the light front answer.

already seen that there is no dynamical scalar zero mode on the light front and thus the sum
over intermediate states cannot include this mode. on the other hand, for arbitrarily small
but non-zero  (space-like quantization) there is a dynamical zero mode in the sum over
intermediate states. by requiring this state to exist in the limit we are not approaching the
light front theory but some peculiar (divergent) regime of the space-like theory. the light-
front theory has its own mechanisms (constraints for zero modes) to replace this missing
dynamical mode.

vi. summary and conclusions

in this work, we have studied continuum and discretized versions of the time ordered (old
fashioned ) perturbation theory in the light-front, near light front and innite momentum
frameworks, applied to scalar eld theory self-energy and scattering amplitudes. we have
recalled important features of the covariant perturbation theory, namely that when feynman
amplitudes are rewritten in terms of the light front variables and the contour integration in
the light-front energy complex plane is performed, the feynman amplitudes reduce back to

16

the continuum light front answers [14]. also, as stressed already by weinberg in 1966 [8],
the light front perturbation theory (old-fashioned perturbation theory in a reference frame
with innite-momentum at that time) is more economical in the sense that one does
not need to introduce feynman parameters to combine propagators in the corresponding
integrals, and the four-dimensional euclidean integration is replaced by a two-dimensional
one. feynman parameters appear in the light front formulation naturally as light front
longitudinal momentum fractions.

more specically, after demonstrating that the continuum light front perturbation theory
has no problem with zero modes and its results agree with the covariant results, we have
analyzed the continuum limit of the light-front perturbation theory formulated in a nite
volume with periodic elds (dlcq method). this investigation was motivated by claims
[1] that dlcq is ill-dened since it is divergent when formulated as a limit of the space-like
quantization on a hypersurface close to the light front [15]. in this connection, we have rst
shown that the dlcq perturbation theory is consistent, because parts of the perturbative
amplitudes due to the eective interactions induced by the constrained zero mode vanish
in the innite-volume limit and the covariant results are reproduced. second, when one
considers the light front limit (  0) of the near light front discretized amplitudes, the
zero-mode contribution indeed diverges for xed box length. but this disagrees with the
light front answer and actually cannot tell anything about the light front zero modes. the
point is that the light front zero mode is not dynamical in the scalar theory and thus it
is not present in the complete set of intermediate states. by letting   0 one is forcing
the dynamical space-like zero mode to exist on the light front which leads to an incorrect,
diverging amplitude. recall the light front dispersion relation for a free particle (dynamical
quantum) p = (m2+(p)2)(p+)1 which gives divergent energy for a mode with p+ = 0 (and
non-zero numerator). it is remarkable how the light front theory copes with this problem:
most of the light front zero modes are non-dynamical, i.e. constrained variables. thus the
above dispersion relation is not applicable. a few known dynamical zero modes are massless
and have vanishing p (global zero modes). the dispersion relation is again not applicable
and one has to treat these modes in a dierent manner (in terms of zero-mode coherent
states, e.g. [13].)

non-covariant regime of the discretized space-like theory.

in other words, the   0 limit does not lead us to the light front theory but to a peculiar
on the other hand, the continuum version of the near light front old fashioned per-
turbation theory reproduces the light front answers (which agree with the covariant ones).
but since this formulation has no particular advantages there is no real reason to use it in
practical calculations.

in the continuum version of old fashioned perturbation theory in the innite momentum
frame, there is no problem in perturbation theory. in the box, the zero mode contribution
scales as 1
l whereas nonzero modes scales independent of l. thus in perturbation theory
zero modes decouple in the continuum limit (l  ).
however, if one reinterprets the boost as the equal time box length let  0 as is done
in m-theory literature (to simulate dlcq for nite l), zero mode contributions diverge. in
this limit, however, there are innite number of terms in the dlcq hamiltonian.

we would like to emphasize that our conclusions are based on the careful analysis of the
scalar eld theories. this choice was motivated by the discussion in the m-theory literature

17

4! 4 scalar theory was analyzed in the near light front
[1], where one-loop scattering in 
framework.
it would be very instructive to perform an analysis, similar to that done in
the present work, within a theory with fermions, and in particular in a gauge theory. this
would help to clarify some unresolved issues in the light front literature [16]. for example,
some authors, using dlcq perturbation theory, found unpleasant quadratic divergences
within the 3+1 dimensional light-front yukawa model. however, the continuum limit was
not studied in their work.

in conclusion, our answer to the question, raised in the paper [1] : does it makes sense
to put a quantum system to a light-like box ? is: yes, it does. light-like compactication
is feasible and dlcq is consistent (there is no problem neither with causality [17]). the
discretized (compactied) formulation of the theory on the light-like surface does exist as a
straightforward light front eld theory, but not as a limit of a space-like compactication.
