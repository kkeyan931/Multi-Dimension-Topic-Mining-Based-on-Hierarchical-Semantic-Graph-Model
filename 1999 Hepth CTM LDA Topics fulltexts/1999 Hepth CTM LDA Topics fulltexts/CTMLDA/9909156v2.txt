abstract

we review the string representations of abelian-projected su(2)- and
su(3)-gauge theories and their application to the evaluation of bilocal eld
strength correlators. the large distance asymptotic behaviours of the latter
ones are shown to be in agreement with the stochastic vacuum model of
qcd and existing lattice data.

1 introduction

the explanation and description of the connement phenomenon in gauge
theories is known to be one of the most fundamental challenges of the modern
qft (see e.g. [1]). till now, an analytical description of this phenomenon
is best of all elaborated on in the theories containing monopole ensembles.
those include, in particular, 3d compact qed [1], where monopoles form a
dilute gas, and qcd-inspired abelian-projected su(n) gauge theories [2].
in the latter case, the dominance of abelian degrees of freedom is usually
realized by assuming that non-abelian (charged) gauge bosons are heavy and
do not propagate at a long-distance scale. in particular by partially xing
the gauge, one removes there as many non-abelian degrees of freedom as
possible, leaving the maximal abelian subgroup [u(1)]n1 unbroken. the
relevant ir degrees of freedom of the resulting abelian-projected theories
are then described by the eld strengths of the (n  1) abelian (neutral)
gauge bosons supplemented by the same amount of magnetic dirac strings
generated by singular gauge transformations. it is further very convenient to
reformulate these theories by means of a duality transformation, which leads
to a theory of dual abelian gauge elds interacting with (n  1) patterns
of monopole currents. finally, performing the summation over the grand
canonical ensembles of such currents by making use of the bardakci-samuel
formula [3], one obtains an equivalent eective ginzburg-landau type la-
grangian for disorder magnetic higgs elds. those belong to the maximal
abelian subgroup [u(1)]n1 [4] and describe the condensates of monopole
cooper pairs. the eective theory described by this lagrangian allows for
the formation of nonvanishing v.e.v.s of magnetic higgs elds mentioned
above and thus realizes the beautiful dual meissner scenario of connement
proposed many years ago by t hooft and mandelstam [5].

since connement is usually associated with the formation of strings
(tubes of electric ux between external quarks) [6], it seems natural to seek
for the description of this phenomenon in terms of elementary string excita-
tions. obviously, the dynamical scheme of a dual superconductor mentioned
above provides us with a very convenient theoretical framework for studying
this problem by a derivation of string representations of the related eec-
tive abelian-projected theories. in fact, due to the multivaluedness of the
phase of the higgs eld, there should arise singularities in the dual gauge
elds, which are natural to be identied with electric abrikosov-nielsen-

2

olesen (ano) type strings [7]. moreover, by virtue of the higgs mechanism,
monopole condensation leads to the nonvanishing mass of the dual gauge
bosons, which sets the scale of the resulting string tension.

in the present talk, we shall briey review recent progress achieved in
the construction of string representations of the above mentioned abelian-
projected su(n) theories. possible consequences of the obtained results
for the realistic qcd, based on the so-called stochastic vacuum model
(svm) [8], will also be discussed.
in our interpretation of this subject in
the two subsequent sections, where the su(2)- and su(3)-cases will be suc-
cessively considered, we shall follow refs. [9] and [10] (see ref. [11] for an
extended review).

2 su(2)theory

as it is commonly argued, the abelian-projected su(2)-gluodynamics is just
the dual abelian higgs model (dahm), whose action in the london limit
(i.e. the limit of innitely large coupling constant  of the magnetic higgs
eld) has the form

ssu (2) = z d4x"1

here, f = b  b is the eld strength tensor of the dual vector
potential b, g is the magnetic coupling constant, and  is the v.e.v. of
the magnetic higgs eld. in the london limit under study, the radial part
of the latter one has been integrated out, whereas its phase has the form
 = sing + reg, where the multivalued part sing describes a given electric
string conguration, while reg stands for a single-valued uctuation around
such a conguration. owing to the fact that the singularities of the phase
of the magnetic higgs eld occur at the world-sheets of closed electric ano
type strings [7], there exists a correspondence between sing and string world-
sheets, given by the equation

sing(x) = 2(x)  2z

d(x())(x  x()).

(2)

here, x()  x() is a vector parametrizing the world-sheet  with  =
(1, 2) standing for the 2d coordinate. this correspondence eventually en-

3

ables one to reformulate the integration over sings as an integration over

x()s. the resulting partition function has the form zsu (2) = r dx()
exp(cid:16)ssu (2)
ssu (2)

(cid:17), where the string eective action reads [9]

here, m = 2g is the mass of the dual gauge boson generated by the higgs
mechanism, and k1 stands for the modied bessel function. the reader is
referred to the above cited papers for details of the so-called path-integral
duality transformation, which leads to eq. (3).

performing the expansion of the action (3) in powers of the derivatives
w.r.t. as, it has been shown that the rst two terms of this expansion are
the standard nambu-goto one and the so-called rigidity term, i.e.

here, a = /a, g = det(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
induced metric tensor of the world-sheet, and t = abg
standing for the extrinsic curvature tensor. the coupling constant of the
nambu-goto term (also called string tension) with the logarithmic accuracy

reads   2 ln
g , while the inverse coupling constant of the rigidity term
(considered rst in ref. [12]) has the form 1
32g2 . in particular, if ex-
0
ternal quarks are introduced into the system, the nambu-goto action yields
a linearly rising quark-antiquark potential vconf(r) = r. notice also the
negative sign of the coupling 0, which reects the stability of strings.

another important subject investigated in ref. [9] is the evaluation of

the irreducible bilocal eld strength correlator (cumulant) dd f(x) f(0)ee,
where f  1

ing the x-independent lorentz structure of the cumulant according to the
svm [8] as (  )d (x2), we nd the following ir asymptotic be-

this behaviour is very similar to the one observed in the lattice simulations
of qcd in ref. [13].
in particular, one can see that the role of the so-
called correlation length of the vacuum, tg, at which the cumulant in svm
decreases, is played in dahm by the inverse mass of the dual gauge boson,
m1. the evaluation of the second coecient function parametrizing the
cumulant, which stands at the omitted x-dependent lorentz structure, also
matches the existing lattice data [13] with a good accuracy.

3 su(3)theory

the eective abelian-projected theory of the su(3)-gluodynamics [4] is also
of the dahm type, albeit with the [u(1)]2 gauge invariance w.r.t. the max-
imal abelian subgroup of the su(3)-group. in the london limit, the action
under study reads

next, in eq. (6) the so-called root vectors ~1 = (1, 0), ~2 = (cid:16) 1

ing the cartan decomposition as the structural constants in the commuta-
tion relations between the diagonal and (properly redened) non-diagonal
su(3)-generators. besides that, the action (6) is assumed to be supplied by
the following constraint imposed on the phases a of magnetic higgs elds,

a = 0, which is just the reection of the fact that the original su(3)

group is special. next, the relation (2) remains the same, with the substitu-
,   a, and x()  x(a)(). consequently,
tion sing  sing
there exist three dierent types of electric strings, among which, however,
only two are independent of each other owing to the above-mentioned con-
straint. performing the path-integral duality transformation of the theory (6)
and integrating out one of the world-sheets (for concreteness, x(3)
 ), we arrive
at the desired string representation for the partition function, which reads

where mb = 6g is the mass of the elds ~b. one can see that, according to
eq. (7), the most crucial dierence of the string eective theory corresponding
to the abelian-projected su(3)-gluodynamics w.r.t. the su(2)-case is the
presence of two independent kinds of strings, which not only self-interact,
but also interact with each other by the exchanges of the massive dual gauge
bosons.

as far as the cumulants of the eld strength tensors f 3,8

 are concerned,

4 conclusions

the obtained results demonstrate the relevance of the method of abelian
projection and the path-integral duality transformation to the description
of the conning properties of the su(2)- and su(3)-gluodynamics. the
approach considered above also provides us with a new eld-theoretical status
of svm and sheds some light on the problem of nding an adequate string
representation of qcd. finally, it is worth mentioning that the eld strength
correlators in dahm have been also investigated beyond the london limit
in refs. [14] and [11].

discussions

n. brambilla (university of vienna)

why do you use the london limit? i think that this limit is appropriate for
large transverse distances from the string, but not for large distances between
an external quark and an antiquark.

d. ebert

the london limit has been used here as a simplifying assumption leading
to innitely thin strings. if one includes an external quark-antiquark pair,
this scheme leads to a connement potential plus a yukawa interaction (aris-
ing as a boundary term). indeed, it would be interesting to go beyond the
london limit in the sense of taking into account the vanishing of the higgs
eld inside the nite core of strings. this is expected to yield, besides the
usual connement potential, a coulomb potential instead of the yukawa one.
