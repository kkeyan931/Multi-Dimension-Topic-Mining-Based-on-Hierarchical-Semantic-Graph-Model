abstract

in this paper we consider wittens bosonic open string eld theory in the presence of
a constant background of the second-rank antisymmetric tensor eld bij. we extend the
operator formulation of gross and jevicki in this situation and construct the overlap vertices
explicitly. as a result we nd a noncommutative structure of the moyal type only in the
zero-mode sector, which is consistent with the result of the correlation functions among
vertex operators in the world sheet formulation. furthermore we nd out a certain unitary
transformation of the string eld which absorbs the moyal type noncommutative structure.
it can be regarded as a microscopic origin of the transformation between the gauge elds in
commutative and noncommutative gauge theories discussed by seiberg and witten.

1 introduction

noncommutative nature of space-time has often appeared in nonperturbative aspects of
string theory.
it has been used in a formulation of interacting open string eld theory
by witten [1, 2]. he has written a classical action of open string eld theory in terms
of noncommutative geometry, where the noncommutativity appears in a product of string
elds. later, four years ago, the dirichlet branes (d-branes) have been recognized as solitonic
objects in superstring theory [3]. further it has been found that the low energy behavior
of the d-branes are well described by supersymmetric yang-mills theory (sym) [4]. in the
situation of some d-branes coinciding, the space-time coordinates are promoted to matrices
which appear as the elds in sym. then the size of the matrices corresponds to the number of
the d-branes, so noncommutativity of the matrices is related to the noncommutative nature
of space-time. on the other hand, it is known that when considering open strings in the
presence of a constant background of the second-rank antisymmetric tensor eld bij, the end
points of the open strings become noncommutative [5, 6, 7]. it means a noncommutativity
of the world volume coordinates of the d-branes, which occurs even for a single d-brane
dierently from the situation mentioned above. although these two types of noncommutative
natures have distinct origins, as was explicitly pointed out in refs. [8, 9], they are related to
each other in the interesting way: innitely many coincident dp-branes can be described
by a single d(p + 2)-brane under a constant b-eld background.

recently, seiberg and witten [10] discussed that the low energy behavior of the d-branes
in the constant b-eld background can be described either by commutative or noncommuta-
tive yang-mills theories2, which corresponds to the dierence of the regularization scheme 
the pauli-villars regularization or the point-splitting regularization  adopted in the world
sheet approach to open string theory. also they argued the relation between the gauge eld
in the commutative theory and that in the noncommutative theory, and obtained its explicit
form in some simple cases3.

in this paper we consider wittens open string eld theory in a constant background
of the b-eld. then we should have a new noncommutativity originating form the b-eld
background in addition to the noncommutativity which already has appeared in the product
of the string elds. we consider the open bosonic string eld theory instead of supersym-
metric one. because the noncommutative structure mentioned above appears independently
of supersymmetry, we do not consider the fermions for the sake of simplicity. we explicitly
construct this open string theory by extending the operator formulation, which has been
given by gross and jevicki [14, 15, 16] in the background of the at space-time, to the case
of the presence of the constant b-eld background. as a result we obtain a product between
the string elds added to the ordinary product by the moyal product acting only on the zero-
modes of the open strings, which reproduces the result of the correlation functions among

2the terminology commutative yang-mills theory or noncommutative yang-mills theory means that
the geometry of the space-time where the yang-mills theory is dened on is commutative or noncommutative
respectively.

vertex operators in the world sheet formulation [10]. it is noted that the part of the product
concerning the nonzero-modes is not aected by the presence of the b-eld background.
the string eld theory with the modied product gives noncommutative yang-mills theory
in the low energy limit. in the string eld theory perspective, there should exist a certain
(hopefully simpler than the yang-mills case) transformation connecting the string eld in
the string eld theory we have constructed and that in a string eld theory leading to com-
mutative yang-mills theory. here we nd that the moyal type noncommutative structure
can be absorbed by a unitary rotation of the string eld. as a result of the rotation, the
string eld theory is transformed to a string eld theory with the ordinary noncommutative
product where the brst charge in the kinetic term is unaected. this fact suggests that
the universality of the interaction vertices in various string eld theories, which has been
discussed in refs.
[17, 18, 19], holds also between open string eld theories with dierent
boundary conditions caused by turning on the b-eld. the string eld theory obtained
by the transformation can be considered to give a microscopic origin of the commutative
yang-mills theory.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we briey review wittens bosonic open
string eld theory and its explicit construction based on the operator formulation elaborated
by gross and jevicki in the case of the neumann boundary condition. we explain open
strings in the presence of a constant b-eld background and obtain the mode-expanded form
of the open string in section 3. as a result, we see that in this situation the end points of the
open string become noncommutative. it has already been discussed by many authors [5, 6, 7,
10]. but in order to make this paper more self-contained and to prepare for construction of
wittens string eld theory in the constant b-eld background, we give a somewhat detailed
argument. in section 4, based on the results in the previous sections, wittens open string
eld theory under the constant b-eld background is constructed explicitly by making use
of the operator formulation. here we obtain the structure of the moyal product in addition
to the ordinary noncommutativity which has already existed in the background of no b-
eld. in section 5, we nd a certain unitary transformation of the string eld which removes
the moyal type noncommutativity from the string eld theory constructed in the previous
section. this transformation can be essentially regarded as a microscopic analog of the map
between the gauge elds in commutative and noncommutative yang-mills theories discussed
in ref. [10]. in section 6, we also discuss about the background independence between open
string eld theories with dierent boundary conditions caused by the presence of the constant
b-eld. until now we have not put the chan-paton factors to the end points of open strings,
which corresponds to the case of the u(1) gauge group in the yang-mills theories. however,
in string eld theory, it is quite a straightforward generalization to introduce the chan-paton
factors as is pointed out in refs.
[20, 21], so we can immediately have the results also in
the case corresponding to the nonabelian gauge group. it forms a contrast to the situation
in yang-mills theory, where in general it is dicult to obtain the concrete form of the map
connecting the gauge elds of the commutative and noncommutative yang-mills theories
except some simple cases4. finally, section 7 is devoted to summary and discussion.
in

appendix a we present the result of the explicit forms of the overlap vertices discussed in
section 2.

2 brief review of wittens open string field theory

in this section, we review some basic properties of wittens bosonic open string eld theory
[1] and its explicit construction based on a fock space representation of string eld functional
and -function overlap vertices [14, 15, 22].

2.1 wittens open string field theory

witten introduced a beautiful formulation of open string eld theory in terms of a noncom-
mutative extension of dierential geometry, where string elds, the brst operator q and

the integration over the string congurations r in string eld theory are analogs of dieretial
forms, the exterior derivative d and the integration over the manifold rm in the dierential
geometry, respectively. the ghost number assigned to the string eld corresponds to the
degree of the dierential form. also the (noncommutative) product between the string elds
 is interpreted as an analog of the wedge product  between the dierential forms.

the axioms obeyed by the system of r ,  and q are

z qa = 0,
q(a  b) = (qa)  b + (1)naa  (qb),
(a  b)  c = a  (b  c),
z a  b = (1)nanb z b  a,

(2.1)

where a, b and c are arbitrary string elds, whose ghost number is half-integer valued:
the ghost number of a is dened by the integer na as na + 1
2.

then witten discussed the following string eld theory action

s =

1
g2

s z (cid:18)1

2

  q +

1
3

    (cid:19) ,

(2.2)

where gs is the open string coupling constant and  is the string eld with the ghost number
 1
2 . the action is invariant under the gauge transformation
 = q +       ,

(2.3)

with the gauge parameter  of the ghost number  3
2.

2.2 operator formulation of string field theory

the objects dened above can be explicitly constructed by using the operator formulation,

where the string eld is represented as a fock space, and the integration r as an inner

3

product on the fock space. it was considered by gross and jevicki [14, 15] in the case of
the neumann boundary condition. we will heavily use the notation of the papers [14, 15].
in the operator formulation, the action (2.2) is described as

s =

1
g2

s (cid:18)1

2 12hv2||i1q|i2 +

1

3 123hv3||i1|i2|i3(cid:19) ,

(2.4)

where the structure of the product  in the kinetic and potential terms is encoded to that
of the overlap vertices hv2| and hv3| respectively5.
as a preparation for giving the explicit form of the overlaps, let us consider open strings in
26-dimensional space-time with the constant metric gij in the neumann boundary condition.
the world sheet action is given by

sw s =

1

4 z d z 

0

dgij( x i x j  x ix j) + sgh,

where sgh is the action of the bc-ghosts:

sgh =

i

2 z d z 

0

d[c+(  )b+ + c( + )b].

(2.5)

(2.6)

under the neumann boundary condition, the string coordinates have the standard mode
expansions:

x j(, ) = xj + 2 pj + i2 xn6=0

1
n

j
nein cos(n),

(2.7)

also the mode expansions of the ghosts are given by

c(, ) = xnz
b(, ) = xnz

cnein()  c(, )  ib(, ),
bnein()  c(, )  ib(, ).

as a result of the quantization, the modes obey the commutation relatons:

[xi, pj] = igij,
{bn, cm} = n+m,0,

[i

n, j

m] = ngijn+m,0,

the otherwises vanish.

the overlap

|vni = |vnix|vnigh

(n = 1, 2,  )

is the state satisfying the continuity conditions for the string coordinates and the ghosts
at the n-string vertex of the string eld theory. the superscripts x and gh show the

5subscripts putted to vectors in the fock space label the strings concerning the vertices.

contribution of the sectors of the coordinates and the ghosts respectively. the continuity
conditions for the coordinates are

(p (r)
(  ))|vnix = 0,

x j() at  = 0, and the superscript (r) labels the string (r) meeting at the vertex6. in the
above formulas, we regard r = 0 as r = n because of the cyclic property of the vertex. for
the ghost sector, we impose the following conditions on the variables c(), b() and their
conjugate momenta c(), b():

c

((r)
c ()  (r1)
(  ))|vnigh = 0,
(b(r)()  b(r1)(  ))|vnigh = 0,
(c(r)() + c(r1)(  ))|vnigh = 0,
b () + (r1)
((r)
(  ))|vnigh = 0,

b

(2.12)

for 0    

2 and r = 1,   , n.

we present the explicit form of |vni for n = 1, 2, 3, 4 in appendix a.

3 open strings in constant b-field background

we consider a constant background of the second-rank antisymmetric tensor eld bij in ad-
dition to the constant metric gij where open strings propagate. then the boundary conditon
at the end points of the open strings changes from the neumann type, and thus the open
string has a dierent mode expansion from the neumann case (2.7). as a result, the end
point is to be noncommutative, in the picture of the d-branes which implies noncommuta-
tivity of the world volume coordinates on the d-branes. here we derive the mode-expanded
form of the open string coordinates as a preparation for a calculation of the overlap vertices
in the next section.

we start with the world sheet action

d[gij( x i x j  x ix j)  2bij( x ix j  x i x j)]
(3.1)

because the term proportional to bij can be written as a total derivative term, it does not
aect the equation of motion but does the boundary condition, which requires

(3.2)
6we often use the expression |vni12n for the overlap when specifying the strings concerning the vertex.

on  = 0, . this can be rewritten to the convenient form

eijx j = (et )ij+x j,

(3.3)

where eij  gij + 2bij, and  are derivatives with respect to the light cone variables
 =   . we can easily see that x j(, ) satisfying the boundary condition (3.3) has the
following mode expansion:

x j(, ) = xj + h(e1)jkgklpl + (e1t )jkgklpl+i

+is

2 xn6=0

n h(e1)jkgkll

+ (e1t )jkgkll

nein+i .

(3.4)

we will obtain the commutators between the modes from the propagator of the open strings,
which gives another derivation dierent from the method by chu and ho [6] based on the
quantization via the dirac bracket. when performing the wick rotation   i and
mapping the world sheet to the upper half plane z = e +i, z = ei (0    ), the
boundary condition (3.3) becomes

eijzx j = (et )ijzx j,

(3.5)

which is imposed on the real axis z = z. the propagator hx i(z, z)x j(z, z)i satisfying the
boundary condition (3.5)is determined as

hx i(z, z)x j(z, z)i = (cid:20)gij ln|z  z|  gij ln|z  z|
z  z
z  z

where gij and ij are given by

gij =

ij = 2

(et1  e1)ij

= (2)2(et1be1)ij = (2)2(e1bet1)ij.

(3.8)

also the constant dij remains unknown from the boundary condition alone. however it is
an irrelevant parameter, so we can x an appropriate value. the mode-expanded form (3.4)
is mapped to

x j(z, z) = xj  i[(e1)jkpk ln z + (e1t )jkpk ln z]

note that the indices of pl and l
of the propagator

n were lowered by the metric gij not gij. recall the denition

hx i(z, z)x j(z, z)i  r(x i(z, z)x j(z, z))  n(x i(z, z)x j(z, z)),

(3.10)

where r and n stand for the radial ordering and the normal ordering respectively. we take
a prescription for the normal ordering which pushes pi to the right and xj to the left with
respect to the zero-modes pi and xj. it corresponds to considering the vacuum satisfying

pj|0i = n,j|0i = 0

(n > 0),

h0|n,j = 0

(n < 0),

(3.11)

which is the standard prescription for calculating the propagator of the massless scalar eld
in two-dimensional conformal eld theory from the operator formalism. making use of eqs.
(3.10), (3.11) and techniques of the contour integration, it is easy to obtain the commutators

[n,i, m,j] = nn+m,0gij,

[xi, pj] = ii
j,

(3.12)

where the rst equation holds for all integers with 0,i  2pi. the constant dij is written
as dij = h0|xixj|0i, which corresponds to dene the normal ordering with respect to xis
as

: xi xj := xixj + dij.

let us x dij as dij =  i
coordinates xi become noncommutative:

2 ij, which is the convention taken in the paper [10]. then the

[xi, xj] = iij,

now we have the mode-expanded form of the string coordinates and the commutation

(3.17)

at the end of this section, we remark that the relations (3.7) and (3.8) are in the same
form as a t-duality transformation, although the correspondence is a formal sense, because
we are not considering any compactication of space-time. the generalized t-duality trans-
formation, namely o(d, d)-transformation, is dened by

e = (ae + b)(ce + d)1

(3.18)

with a, b, c and d being d  d real matrices. (d is the dimension of space-time.) the
matrix

(3.19)

(3.20)

h =   a b
c d !

is o(d, d) matrix, which satises

where

ht jh = j

the relations (3.7) and (3.8) correspond to the case of the inversion a = d = 0, b = c = 1d.

4 construction of overlap vertices

here we construct wittens open string theory in the constant b-eld background by ob-
taining the explicit formulas of the overlap vertices. as is understood from the fact that the
action of the ghosts (2.6) contains no background elds, the ghost sector is not aected by
turning on the b-eld background. thus we may consider the coordinate sector only. first,
let us see the mode-expanded forms of the coordinates and the momenta at  = 0

the nonvanishing commutators are given by

[xn,k, pm,l] = igkln,m,

[yk, pl] = igkl.

(4.3)

(4.4)

we should note that the metric appearing in eqs. (4.4) is gij, instead of gij. so it can be
seen that if we employ the variables with the lowered space-time indices yk, pk, xn,k and pn,k,
the metric used in the expression of the overlaps is gij not gij.

the continuity condition (2.11) is universal for any background, and the mode expansion
of the momenta pi()s is of the same form as in the neumann case, thus the continuity
conditions for the momenta in terms of the modes pn,i are identical with those in the neumann
case. also, since pn,is mutually commute, it is natural to nd a solution of the continuity
condition, assuming the following form for the overlap vertices:

1n and |vnix

where | vnix
1n are the overlaps in the background corresponding to the world
sheet actions (3.1) and (2.5) respectively, the explicit form of the latter is given in appendix a.
clearly the expression (4.5) satises the continuity conditions for the modes of the momenta,
and the coecients z rs
nms are determined so that the continuity conditions for the coordinates
are satised.

4.1 | iix  | v1ix
for the n = 1 case, we consider the identity overlap | iix  | v1ix. the continuity conditions
for the momenta require that

pi = 0,

pn,i = 0

(n = 2, 4, 6,  ),

(4.7)

which is satised by the overlap in the neumann case |ii. in addition, the conditions for
the coordinates are that

by using eq. (4.7). so what we have to consider is the remaining condition xn,k = 0 for
n = 1, 3, 5,  , which however is nothing but the continuity condition for the coordinates in
the neumann case. it can be understood from the point that the second line in eq. (4.8)
does not depend on ij. thus it turns out that the continuity conditions in the case of the
b-eld turned on are satised by the identity overlap made in the neumann case (a.1). the
solution is

for the momentum variables we also dene the z4-fourier transformed variables p1,i()(

where t = 1, 2, 3, 4. from now on, we frequently omit the subscript t for the t = 1 case, and
at the same time we employ the expression with a bar instead of putting the subscript t for
the t = 3 case.

using those variables, the continuity conditions are written as

qj
4()  qj

4(  ) = 0,

p4,i() + p4,i(  ) = 0,

7for the n = 1 and 2 cases, it turns out that the phase factor in (4.5) becomes trivial, by using the
continuity conditions for the momenta and the antisymmetric property of ij . we can understand the results
(4.9) and (4.14) also from this point.

(1 + c)|q2,k)| v4ix = (1  c)|p2,k)| v4ix = 0,

(4.19)

which can be seen from the point that the conditions (4.18) for the sectors of t = 2 and 4
lead the same relations between the modes as those without the terms containing jk. here
we adopted the vector notation for the modes

|qt,k) = 


qt,0,k
qt,1,k

...

,




|pt,k) = 


pt,0,k
pt,1,k

,

(4.20)

and c is a matrix such that (c)nm = (1)nnm (n, m  0). thus there is needed no
correction containing ij for the sectors of t = 2 and 4, so it is natural to assume the form
of the phase factor in eq. (4.15) as

next let us consider the conditions for the sectors of t = 1 and 3. we rewrite the mode

expansions of qj() and qj() as

using the conditions for pi() and pi() in (4.18), we can reduce the conditions for qj()
and qj() to those for qj() and  qj():

qj() = ( iqj(  )

 qj() = ( i qj(  )

these formulas are translated to the relations between the modes via the fourier transfor-

if we pay attention to eqs. (4.28). here  is an unknown real constant, which is not xed
by the continuity conditions alone. this ambiguity of the solution comes from the property
of the matrix x: xc = cx. however it will become clear that the term containing the
constant  does not contribute to the vertex | v4ix.

therefore, we have the expression of the phase (4.21)

(1 + c)|p3,i)| v3ix = (1  c)|q3,i)| v3ix = 0.

(4.39)

thus the t = 3 component does not couple with ij, so we can nd the solution by determining
the single anti-hermitian matrix z in the phase factor whose form is assumed as

(4.40)

for the sectors of t = 1 and 2, the same argument goes on as in the 4-string case. qj()
and qj() have the mode expansions same as in eqs. (4.22) and (4.23). the conditions we
have to consider are

qj() = ( eqj(  )

 qj() = ( e qj(  )

which are rewritten as the relations between the modes

(1  y )|qi)| v3ix = (1  y t )|qi)| v3ix = 0.

(4.41)

(4.42)

the matrix y is dened below eqs. (a.27). recalling the conditions in the neumann case

(1 + y )|pi)|v3ix = (1 + y t )| pi)|v3ix = 0,
(1  y )|qi)|v3ix = (1  y t )| qi)|v3ix = 0,

we end up with the following equations

satises the above equations. it should be noted that in this case, because of cy c = y 6=
y , it does not contain any unknown constant dierently from the 4-string case.
owing to the condition (4.43) we can write the phase factor only in terms of the zero-
modes. finally we have

it is not clear whether the solutions we have obtained here are unique or not. however
we can show that the phase factors are consistent with the relations between the overlaps
which they should satisfy :

3h i| v3i123 = | v2i12,

4h i| v4i1234 = | v3i123,

by using the momentum conservation on the vertices (p(1)
1n = 0. further-
more we can see that the phase factors successfully reproduce the moyal product structures
of the correlators among vertex operators obtained in the perturbative approach to open
string theory in the constant b-eld background [10]. these facts convince us that the
solutions obtained here are physically meaningful.

5 transformation of string fields

in the previous section, we have explicitly constructed the overlap vertices in the operator
formulation under the constant b-eld background. then we have obtained the vertices with
a new noncommutative structure of the moyal type originating from the constant b-eld,
in addition to the ordinary product  of string elds. denoting the product with the new
structure by , the action of the string eld theory is written as

(5.1)

where the brst charge q is constructed from the world sheet action (3.1). the theory (5.1)
gives the noncommutative u(1) yang-mills theory in the low energy region in the same sense

16

as wittens open string eld theory in the case of the neumann boundary condition leads
to the ordinary u(1) yang-mills theory in the low energy limit9.

in ref. [10], seiberg and witten argued that open string theory in the constant b-eld
background leads to either commutative or noncommutative yang-mills theories, correspond-
ing to the dierent regularization scheme  the pauli-villars regularization or the point-
splitting regularization  in the world sheet formulation. they discussed a map between
the gauge elds in the commutative and noncommutative yang-mills theories. in string eld
theory perspective, there also should be a certain transformation (hopefully simpler than
the yang-mills case) from the string eld  in (5.1) to a string eld in a new string eld
theory which leads to the commutative yang-mills theory in the low energy limit.

here we obtain the new string eld theory by nding a unitary transformation which
absorbs the noncommutative structure of the moyal type in the product  into a redenition
of the string elds. there are used the two vertices | v2i and | v3i in the action (5.1). recall
that the 2-string vertex is in the same form as in the neumann case and has no moyal type
noncommutative structure. first, we consider the phase factor of the 3-string vertex which
multiplies in front of |v3i (see eq. (4.48).). making use of the continuity conditions

(5.5)

17

with | ir = ur|ir. it should be remarked that this manipulation has been suceeded owing to
the factorized expression of the phase factor, which originates from the continuity conditions
relating the zero-modes to the nonzero-modes (5.2). it is a characteristic feature of string
eld theory that can not be found in any local eld theories.

next let us see the kinetic term. in doing so, it is judicious to write the kinetic term as

follows:

12h v2||i1(q|i2) =123h v3||i1(ql|ii2|i3 + |i2ql|ii3),

where ql is dened by integrating the brst current jbrst () with respect to  over the
left half region

(5.6)

(5.7)

(5.8)

eq. (5.6) is also represented by the product  as

ql = z /2

0

djbrst ().

  (q) =   [(qli)   +   (qli)].

i stands for the identity element with respect to the -product, carrying the ghost number
 3
2 , which corresponds to |ii in the operator formulation. as is discussed in ref.
[19], in
order to show the relation (5.8) we need the formulas

qri = qli,
(qr)   = (1)n   (ql)

(5.9)

for arbitrary string elds  and , where qr is the integrated brst current over the right
half region of . n stands for the ghost number of the string eld  minus 1
2, and takes an
integer value. the rst formula means that the identity element is a physical quantity, also
the second does the conservation of the brst charge10. by using these formulas, the rst
term in the bracket in r. h. s. of eq. (5.8) becomes

(qli)   = (qri)   = i  (ql) = ql.

also, it turns out that the second term is equal to qr. combining these, we can see that
the eq. (5.8) holds.

further, we should remark that because the brst current does not contain the center
of mass coordinate xj, it commute with the momentum pi. from the continuity condition
pi|ii = 0, it can be seen that piql|ii = 0. expanding the exponential in the expression of
the unitary operator (5.4) and passing the momentum p0,i to the right, we obtain

now we can write down the result of the kinetic term. as a result of the same manipulation
as in eq. (5.5) and the use of eq. (5.10), we have

uql|ii = ql|ii.

(5.10)

12h v2||i1(q|i2) = 123h v3||i1(ql|ii2|i3 + |i2ql|ii3)
= 123hv3|| i1(ql|ii2| i3 + | i2ql|ii3)
= 12hv2|| i1(q| i2).

(5.11)

10for a proof of these formulas, we can use the same argument as in ref. [19] and references therein.

18

what would be going on? let us see this. from the continuity conditions for | v2ix

here we have a comment. if we considered the kinetic term itself without using eq. (5.6),
12 = |v2ix
12:
(5.12)

p(1)
0,i + p(2)

0,i = 0,

p(1)
n,i + (1)np(2)

n,i = 0

(n = 1, 2,  ),

it could be shown that the 2-string overlap is invariant under the unitary rotation

u1u2|v2i12 = |v2i12.

so we would nd the expression for the kinetic term after the rotation

12hv2||i1q|i2 = 12hv2|| i1 q| i2,

where q is the brst charge similarity transformed by u

q = uqu.

(5.13)

(5.14)

(5.15)

however, after some computations of the r. h. s. of eq. (5.15), we could see that q has
divergent term proportional to

1

xn=1,3,5,

and thus it is not well-dened. it seems that this procedure is not correct and needs some
suitable regularization, which preserves the conformal symmetry11. it is considered that the
use of eq. (5.6) gives that kind of regularization, which will be justied at the end of the
next section.

therefore the string eld theory action (5.1) with the moyal type noncommutativity
added to the ordinary noncommutativity is equivalently rewritten as the one with the ordi-
nary noncommutativity alone:

(5.17)

11that divergence comes from the mid-point sigularity of the string coordinates transformed by u. in

fact, after some calculations, we have

u x j()u  = x j()  i

jk

42 xn=1,3,5,

xn0pn,k

4

pk sgn(cid:16) 



2(cid:17) .

(5.16)

the last term leads to the mid-point sigularity in the energy-momentum tensor and the brst charge q. it
seems that the use of eq. (5.6) corresponds to taking the point splitting regularization with respect to the
mid-point. because of the discontinuity of the last term in eq. (5.16), it is considered that the transformed
string coordinates have no longer a good picture as a string. it could be understood from the point that the
transformation u drives states around a perturbative vacuum to those around highly nonperturbative one
like coherent states.

19

it is noted that the brst charge q, which is constructed from the world sheet action (3.1),
has the same form as the one obtained from the action (2.5) with the relation (3.7). so all
the b-dependence has been stued into the string elds except that existing in the metric
gij. furthermore, recalling that the relation between the metrics gij and gij is the same
form as the t-duality inversion transformation, which was pointed out at the end of section
3, we can make the metric gij appear in the overlap vertices, instead of the metric gij. to
do so, we consider the following transformation for the modes:

i
n = (et1)ikn,k,

pi = (et1)ikpk,

xi = eikxk.

(5.18)

by this transformation, the commutators become

[i

n, j

m] = ngijn+m,0,

[pi, xj] = ii
j,

and the bilinear form of the modes

gijn,im,j = gij i

n j
m,
gijpim,j = gij pi j
m,
gijpipj = gij pi pj.

(5.19)

(5.20)

since in viewing the expressions of the overlaps (a.6) and (a.25) the metric gij appears only
through the bilinear forms (5.20), now the dependence of the background bij can be com-
pletely removed from the overlaps |v2i and |v3i in the action (5.17) after the transformation
(5.18).
remark that we have performed the unitary rotation and the t-duality inversion but
have not any shift of the string eld.
in string eld theory perspective, the background
is changed by shifting the string eld by a solution of the classical string eld equation.
because we have done no such a shift, it is possible to consider that the two actions (5.1)
and (5.17) describe open strings in the same background. the one (5.1) certainly leads to the
noncommutative yang-mills theory in the low energy limit. also, it is clear that the other
(5.17) gives the commutative yang-mills theory as the low energy eective theory. thus
it is considered that the unitary transformation | i = u|i combined with the t-duality
inversion (5.18) corresponds to a microscopic analog of the map between the gauge elds in
the commutative and noncommutative yang-mills theories in ref. [10].

we end this section by noting a following comment. we have had the string eld theories
which describe the commutaive and noncommutative yang-mills theories at the low energy
region. they have the identical string coupling gs. on the other hand, according to an
analysis of the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) actions corresponding to the commutative and non-
commutative yang-mills theories in ref. [10], it turns out that the coupling constants of the
commutative and noncommutative dbi actions, denoted by g(dbi)
respectively,
dier by a factor depending on the metrics:

and g(dbi)

s

s

g(dbi)

s

(det g)1/4 = g(dbi)

s

(det g)1/4.

(5.21)

20

at a glance, our result seems not to be consistent with (5.21). however, here we should
remark that the string coupling gs is not identical with the coupling appearing in the dbi
action g(dbi)

. they are related by

s

g(dbi)

s

= gs(det g)1/4,

(5.22)

which can be seen in the process of a calculation of the disk amplitude12. thus, our result
matches with the analysis of the dbi actions.

6 background independence

in this section, we show that both theories in the background described by the world sheet
action (3.1) and in the background of the metric gij alone are derived from the single purely
cubic action

1

3g2
s

123h v3||i1|i2|i3,

(6.1)

s3 =

1

s z      =

3g2

by using the unitary transformation (5.4) together with an argument in ref. [19]. the result
gives a new type of the background independence connecting between theories with dierent
boundary conditions caused by the background bij.

first we note that the cubic action has a universal structure. the moyal type noncom-
mutativity is absorbed into the redenition of the string eld | i = u|i as discussed in the
previous section. also we can get rid of the dependence of the metric gij. since gij can be
diagonalized by an appropriate orthogonal matrix, we rotate the modes n,i, pi and xi by the
orthogonal matrix and absorb the eigenvalues into suitable rescalings of the modes. so the
metric appearing in the commutators and in the bilinear forms can be made minkowskian:

[n,i, m,j] = ngijn+m,0  [n,i, m,j] = nijn+m,0,

gijn,im,j  ijn,im,j,
gijpim,j  ijpim,j,

gijpipj  ijpipj.

(6.2)

as a result, the cubic action (6.1) is to have no specic dependence of the background gij and
bij. it shows that the universality of the interaction vertices in string eld theory discussed
in refs. [17, 18, 19] holds also between the open string eld theories with dierent boundary
conditions.

the classical equation of motion obtained from the action (6.1) is

let us denote the brst charge derived from the world sheet action (3.1) by q. we see that
 = qli gives a solution of (6.3) by using the properties

   = 0.

(6.3)

12for example, see ref. [23].

{q, ql} = 0

21

(6.4)

in addition to eqs. (5.9). when showing eq. (6.4) by a direct calculation, it is crucial that
the brst current jbrst is a primary eld with the conformal weight 1. we decompose the
string eld  into the solution qli and the uctuation around it . then, we can rewrite
the cubic action into wittens form (5.1) by using eq. (5.6).

on the other hand, via the unitary transformation (5.4), the cubic action (6.1) becomes

s3 =

1

s z      =

3g2

1

3g2
s

123hv3|| i1| i2| i3.

(6.5)

we write as q0 the brst charge corresponding to the world sheet action in the background
of the metric gij alone. after considering the transformation (5.18), it is found that  = q0
li
satises the equation of motion    = 0. we expand the string eld around this solution
as  = q0
li + , and then the string eld action in the background of the metric alone is
obtained:

1
g2

s z (cid:18)1

  (q0 ) +

2

1
3

    (cid:19) .

s0 =

(6.6)

by combining these two facts we conclude that the theory in the background gij and bij
(5.1) is connected to the theory in the background gij alone (6.6). it is the advertised result.
at the end of this section we give a justication of the regularization used in the previous
section by showing the equivalence of the actions (5.1) and (5.17). if we do not consider
the transformation (5.18) in the action (6.5), we naturally nd  = qli as a solution. in
fact, because both brst currents corresponding to q0 and q are primary elds with the
conformal weight 1, they are qualied to be a background of string theory. after the same
procedure as the above, we have the action

s =

1
g2

s z (cid:18)1

2

  (q ) +

1
3

    (cid:19) ,

(6.7)

which represents the theory in the background gij and bij. thus it turns out that the
actions (5.1) and (6.7) describe the theory in the same background, which is nothing but the
equivalence of eq. (5.1) and eq. (5.17).

7 discussions

we have considered wittens open string eld theory in the presence of a constant back-
ground of the second-rank antisymmetric tensor eld bij. we have extended the operator
formulation based on a fock space representation of string elds and overlap vertices in this
situation, and have constructed explicitly the overlap vertices.

as a result, we have found a new kind of noncommutative structure in addition to the
ordinary noncommutativity which exists irrespective of the b-eld background. it appears
only in a part of the string eld product, which is the part concerning the zero-modes, and
the form is a product of the moyal type. it is consistent with the result of the correlation
functions among vertex operators in the world sheet formulation. the string eld theory
obtained here gives the noncommutative yang-mills theory in the low energy limit.

22

furthermore we have found that the moyal type noncommutativity can be absorbed into
a redenition of the string elds by a unitary transformation. after the transformation, the
string eld theory is rewritten into a string eld theory with the ordinary noncommutative
product. although there still exists the b-eld dependence in the metric appearing in
the overlaps, we can perform the t-duality inversion transformation so as to completely
absorb it. this theory describes the commutative yang-mills theory in the low energy
region. the unitary transformation plus the t-duality inversion transformation is considered
to be a microscopic analog of the map between the gauge elds in the commutative and
noncommutative yang-mills theories discussed in ref. [10].

also we have considered the background independence in this situation along the same
line as discussed in ref.
[19]. it has been shown that the theory in the background of the
b-eld as well as the metric is connected to that in the background of the metric alone
by an appropriate redenition of the string elds. we have seen that the universality of
the interaction vertices in string eld theory argued before in refs.
[17, 18, 19] holds also
between the open string theories with dierent boundary conditons caused by the b-eld
background.

until now, we have not put the chan-paton factors to the end points of open strings,
which corresponds to considering the case of the u(1)-gauge group in yang-mills theory.
however, as is pointed out in refs. [20, 21], it is a straghtforward generalization to introduce
the chan-paton factors in wittens open string eld theory:

scp =

=

2

1
g2
1
g2

s z (cid:18)1
s (cid:18)1

a  qb tr(ab) +

1
3

a  b  c tr(abc)(cid:19)

2 12hv2||ai1q|bi2 tr(ab) +

1

3 123hv3||ai1|bi2|ci3 tr(abc)(cid:19) , (7.1)

where a, b and c stand for the chan-paton factors, and a is a generator of the gauge group.
since the structure of the gauge group and that of the overlaps appear in the factorized form,
we can consider them independently. thus we can immediately write down the string eld
theory action with the chan-paton factors in the presence of the b-eld background as

2

1
g2

g2

s z (cid:18)1
s (cid:18)1

1

=

2 12h v2||ai1q|bi2 tr(ab) +

3 123h v3||ai1|bi2|ci3 tr(abc)(cid:19) , (7.2)
where the product  and the overlap vertices | v2i and | v3i are identical with those constructed
in the u(1) case. it is clear that, by using the same argument as in the u(1) case, we can
absorb the moyal type noncommutativity and obtain the string eld theory leading to the
commutative yang-mills theory in the low energy limit.

at rst sight, it seems that in the form of the string eld action (7.2) the noncommuta-
tivity originating from the b-eld background (the product ) does not have any connection
with that from the nonabelian gauge group (the chan-paton factor). on the other hand, it

23

is known that these two noncommutative natures are related to each other in the interesting
way: innitely many coincident dp-branes can be described by a single d(p + 2)-brane in
the background of some constant b-eld. this phenomenon has been discussed in the world
sheet formulation of open string theory in ref. [8, 9]. so in the framework of wittens open
string eld theory constructed here, it might be interesting to examine how the noncom-
mutativity from the nonabelian gauge group transmutes into that from the constant b-eld
background. because in matrix theory [24, 25] higher dimensional d-branes are constructed
from the constituent d-particles by utilizing the above fact13, it might be useful for clarifying
the connection between matrix theory and open string eld theory, and further it might give
a hint for considering the covariant and nonperturbative formulation of m-theory.

a lot of variable discussions about wittens open string theory and its operator formulation
for the rst half of the year 1997. a part of this work was done during his visit at c. e. a.
saclay. the author would like to thank members of c. e. a. saclay for their warm hospitality,
especially i. kostov for his kindness. also the author wishes to thank n. ishibashi and t.
yoneya for helpful discussions. the research of the author is supported by the japan society

13a similar phenomenon as the above is known also in the context of the iib matrix model [26]. non-
commutative yang-mills theory in four dimensions arises in expanding matrices around a classical solution
which represents a condensation of d-instantons and composes a d3-brane [27].

a explicit form of overlap vertices in the neumann

boundary condition

here we give the explicit form of the overlap vertices |vni, which satisfy the continuity
conditions (2.11) and (2.12), in the case of n = 1, 2, 3, 4. although it is a slight generalization
of the result in the background of the at space-time by gross and jevicki [14, 15], we present
it in order to make this paper more self-contained.

it by |ii. its explicit form is as follows.

when considering the connection to the string perturbation theory, it is convenient to
take the momentum representation rather than the oscillator representation with respect
to the zero-modes. in order to translate into the momentum representation, we need the
momentum eigenstate constructed from the vacuum of the zero-mode oscillators, which is
given by

the zero-modes:

finally we show the result of the ghost 3-string overlap vertex:

where the matrices w rss are related to the single matrix w as

(a.37)

which is dierent from the relation for u (a.26) by the sign in front of c. the explicit from
of w is given as follows:
for n, m  1 and n 6= m,

n+m

(n + m : odd),

for the diagonal elements,

w00 = w00 = 0,
(w + w )nn = (1)n(1  anbn) + nn,
(w  w )nn = 0

(n  1).

the vacuum |i123 is the tensor product of the three vacua |+ir (r = 1, 2, 3), whose ghost
number is + 3

have.
