abstract

we show that renormalization in quantum eld theory is a special instance
of a general mathematical procedure of multiplicative extraction of nite
values based on the riemannhilbert problem. given a loop (z), |z| = 1
of elements of a complex lie group g the general procedure is given by
evaluation of +(z) at z = 0 after performing the birkho decomposition
(z) = (z)1+(z) where (z)  g are loops holomorphic in the inner
and outer domains of the riemann sphere (with () = 1). we show
that, using dimensional regularization, the bare data in quantum eld
theory delivers a loop (where z is now the deviation from 4 of the complex
dimension) of elements of the decorated butcher group (obtained using the
milnor-moore theorem from the kreimer hopf algebra of renormalization)
and that the above general procedure delivers the renormalized physical
theory in the minimal substraction scheme.

introduction

it has become increasingly clear in [1] [2] [3] that the nitty-gritty of the per-
turbative expansion in quantum eld theory is hiding a beautiful underlying
algebraic structure which does not meet the eye at rst sight.

as is well known most of the terms in the perturbative expansion are given
by divergent integrals which require renormalization. in [1] the renormalization
technique was shown to give rise to a hopf algebra whose antipode s deliv-
ers the same terms as those involved in the subtraction procedure before the

renormalization map r is applied. in [2] the group g associated to this hopf
algebra by the milnormoore theorem was computed by exhibiting a basis and
computing lie brackets for its lie algebra.1 it was shown that the collection of
all bare amplitudes indexed by feynman diagrams in dimensionally regularized
perturbative quantum eld theory is just a point  in the group gk, where
k = c[z1, [z]] is the eld of laurent series.

though this made it clear that the hopf algebra and its antipode are provid-
ing the correct framework to understand renormalization, some of the mystery
was still around because of the somewhat ad hoc manner, in which the antipode
s had to be twisted by the renormalization map r in order to fully account for
the physical computations.

the twisted antipode sr is dened recursively [1, 3] by

sr(x) = r[(x) + sr(x )(x )],

(1)

where we abbreviate the coproduct of x as (x) = x  1 + 1  x + x   x ,
omitting the summation sign for abbreviation always and assuming e(x) = 0,
where e is the counit.

the introduction of the twisted antipode is imposed by the actual operations

performed in renormalization. thanks to multiplicativity constraints (m.c.s),

r[xy ]  r[r[x]y ]  r[xr[y ]] + r[x]r[y ] = 0,

sr was shown in [3] to cover all algebraic aspects of multiplicative renormaliza-
tion, sr(xy ) = sr(y )sr(x), including scale transformations and changes of
renormalization schemes by operations in the group.

but except from an obvious analogy between the recursive denition of sr
and the usual recursive construction of the antipode s the conceptual under-
standing of the twisted antipode was obviously missing.

we shall unveil the conceptual nature of sr thanks to the riemannhilbert

problem [5] for the group g.

this problem which together with the inverse scattering method has been a
very successful tool to solve soliton equations, can be formulated as follows: for
a given analytic curve c  cp 1 and a map  from c to a complex lie group
g, nd the decomposition

(z) = (z)1+(z),

(2)

of  as a pointwise product where +(z) (resp. (z)) is the boundary value of
an holomorphic map from the inner (resp. outer) domain of c to the group g
and  is normalized by () = 1. this decomposition is called the birkho
decomposition.

1in the simplest instance this group was later identied in [4] as the butcher group of
numerical analysis. for the general case we will use the terminology of decorated butcher
group.

2

what we shall show is that the renormalized theory is obtained from the
bare theory through the riemannhilbert problem for the group g as follows.
as we have seen above, given a quantum eld theory, the collection of all
bare amplitudes indexed by feynman diagrams in dimensionally regularized
perturbative quantum eld theory is just a point  in the group gk, where
k = c[z1, [z]] is the eld of laurent series.

in fact, looking more closely, this bare data is encapsulated as a loop (z)
of elements in the group g, where z is the complex deviation from dimension
four and lies in a small circle c around the origin.

the renormalized theory is just the evaluation at d = 4 of the holomor-
phic piece + in the birkho decomposition of the loop  as a product of two
holomorphic maps  from the respective connected components c of the
complement of the circle c in the riemann sphere cp 1.

thus, the nuance between naive subtraction of pole parts and renormal-
ization by local counterterms is the same as passing from the additive hilbert
transform to the multiplicative riemannhilbert problem.

this allows us to complete our understanding of the conceptual nature of
renormalization and to assert that, contrary to its reputation, the subtraction
procedure as applied by practitioners of qft successfully over many decades is
now backed by its conceptual signicance.

2 the twisted antipode and the birkho decom-

position

let h be a positively graded2 hopf algebra over c which is commutative as an
algebra. let g be the group of characters of the algebra h, endowed with the
group operation 1  2 given by the formula

1  2(x) = 1  2((x)) x  h.

(3)

where  is the coproduct.

we shall show in this section that the riemannhilbert problem for g yields

exactly the dening equation for the twisted antipode sr.

we let r be the ring of laurent polynomials 3 and r : r  r be the linear
projection on the subalgebra r generated by z1 parallel to the subalgebra
r+ generated by 1, z.

let us rst recall for clarity the standard dictionary between the language
of homomorphisms from h  r (resp. to r) and the language of loops with
values in g and domain the inner and outer components c of the complement

2we assume that the subspace hn of elements of degree n is nite dimensional for each n

and that h0 is reduced to scalars.

3the discussion also applies to the ring of meromorphic functions in c+ whose only sin-

gularity in c+ is a pole of nite order at 0.

3

of the unit circle c. we let h be the augmentation ideal of h, ie. the kernel of
the counit. the dictionary is then the following:

homomorphisms from h  r |
|
( h)  r |

loops from c to g

 extends to a holomorphic map from c  g

| with () = 1.
|
( h)  r+ |
|
|
|
  s |

z  (z)1.

 extends to a holomorphic map from c+  g.

 = 1  2

(z) = 1(z)2(z),  z  c.

for elements x  h we shall use as above the short-hand notation

(x) = x  1 + 1  x + x   x 

(4)

(5)

where we omit the summation and the components x  and x  are of degree
strictly less than that of x for x  hn, n > 0.

theorem 1: let  be an homomorphism from h  r. the -component
  + of the corresponding loop is charac-

of the birkho decomposition  = 1
terized as the unique solution of the following equation

(x) = r[(x) + (x )(x )], x  h.

(6)

the main point of this theorem, of course, is that this equation is identical

to the dening equation for the twisted antipode sr.

proof: by uniqueness of the solution of the riemannhilbert problem it is
enough to exhibit one solution. let us dene  by  = e (where e is the counit
of h) on elements of h of degree zero and then by induction, using the above
equation. the rst thing to check which is not obvious is that this denition
actually yields a homomorphism. this follows from [3] using the multiplicativity
property of the map r

r[xy]  r[r[x]y]  r[xr[y]] + r[x]r[y] = 0.

(7)

for the sake of completeness we briey recall the main ingredients of the proof.
it suces to prove the assertion for homogeneous elements x, y of non-zero
degree. this is done by induction on the sum of the respective degrees. writing
the recursive denition for both (x) and (y ), and taking the product
yields a sum of nine terms which one has to equate with the terms coming from
the recursive denition applied to xy . one has

(xy ) = xy  1 + 1  xy + x  y + y  x + x y  x  + x   x y

+ xy   y  + y   xy  + x y   x y .

4

using the induction hypothesis, i.e. the multiplicativity of  together with the
dening equation of  one easily reorganizes the above nine terms, using (6),
to get the desired result.

now that we know that  is a homomorphism we just need to check that
( h)  r which is obvious by construction since r is the range of the
projection r, and that the product    lands in r+. but r+ is the kernel
of r and it suces to check that the composition r[  ] vanishes. but this
follows directly from the dening equation using r[] = . 

3 multiplicative renormalization

let us go back to the twisted antipode sr. first of all, sr should be viewed as
a homomorphism from the hopf algebra h to the ring of meromorphic functions
in c+ whose only singularity in c+ is a pole of nite order at 0. its recursive
denition starts with the given homomorphism  from h to k and modies it
by induction using the above formula

sr(x) = r[(x) + sr(x )(x )],

(8)

while sr(e) = 1.

theorem 2: the transition from the bare green function (x) to the ms-
renormalized green function (x) = [sr  (x)] is the multiplicative projection
of the bare green function  to the holomorphic part + followed by evaluation
at the origin.4

the proof of this theorem relies on the results of [1][2][3], on theorem 1 and

on the detailed discussion of dimensional regularization in the next section.

the relation between dierent renormalization schemes explained in [3] also
explains the niteness of green functions when we vary dimensionful parame-
ters. it is common practice to maintain dimensionless coupling constants in di-
mensional regularization by introducing a dimensionful parameter [2]z into the
integral measure, as in the example exhibited in the next section. the birkho
decomposition is done at q2 = 2, say. at other q2, one imposes on feynman
graphs  with deg() = n loops a homomorphism () = [2/q2]z deg() which
is in accordance with the m.c.s.

it is important to stress that in the above multiplicative renormalization
procedure the precise location of the curve c is not crucial since one can move
it freely by a homotopy in the complement of the singularities of the initial loop
.

we shall end the paper with a few comments on the known crucial features

of dimensional regularization which enabled us to obtain this result.

4this result is applicable as long as the theory under consideration allows for local coun-

terterms, which includes renormalizable theories but also eective theories.

4 dimensional regularization

dimensional regularization (dim.reg.) can be characterized by the three follow-
ing properties: it naturally involves cp 1, it projects to logarithmic divergences
and it raises internal propagators to complex powers.

it promotes the dimension four of spacetime consistently to an analytic con-
tinuation to d = 4  2z, z  c, so that the complex parameter z serves as
a regularization parameter. it is not necessary to exhibit the technical details
of this analytic continuation, we rather comment on its most useful properties
mentioned above.

all the above three properties distinguish it from regularization prescriptions
which use a dimensionful regularization parameter, like in a cut-o or pauli-
villars scheme, where

 a dimensionful parameter  parametrizes the divergences by a nite series
in  and log , and the convergent part as a series in 1/, spoiling any
attempt towards using  for a holomorphic decomposition of the nite and
divergent part;

 it involves no projection onto logarithmic divergences at the level of the

regularization;

 integration of subgraphs evaluates to logarithms of internal propagators

instead of complex powers.

the practical advantages of dim.reg. in this respect are so severe5 that
even a prescription like on-shell bphz, fully avoiding regularization at all, can-
not compete with dim.reg. in practical calculations. we now see that this is
underwritten from a conceptual viewpoint: it is actually the presence of com-
plex domains provided by z = (4  d)/2  c in dim.reg. which allows to
promote renormalization to a concept.

let us for the sake of the reader exhibit these features in some detail using
simple examples. let us consider the basic integral in dimensionally regularized
euclidean space

k2 + m2 = m2z

ddk
[2]z

k2(k2 + m2)

k2 .

in dim.reg., the last expression on the rhs is zero thanks to analytic continua-
tion, which gives [6], as one of dim.reg.s dening properties,

z

ddk
[2]z [k2]a = 0,

5see [7] for a typical example of a calculation which would have been barely possible

without dim.reg. and the multiplicativity properties of counterterms.

6

for all a  c. the rst expression on the rhs of (5) evaluates to m2[m2/2]z
2z(1 + z), with the (1 + z)-function delivering the expected pole term
near z = 0.

evaluating the same quadratic divergent integrand by a standard integral in

four dimension, multiplying the integrand with a cut-o function [ p(k2)],

we nd the result m22[log 2/m2 + log(1 + m2/2)] + 22, where    is
now the limit of interest.

what can we learn from this basic example? first of all, we use it to exhibit
what we mean when we say that dim.reg. naturally involves cp 1. clearly, the
bare result in dim.reg. is a series which has a pole in z of nite order (rst order
in the example) and is an innite taylor series in z. we hence can formulate
the quest for the birkho decomposition in the framework used above.

further, the result r ddk

[2]z [k2]a = 0 immediately ensures that one only con-
fronts logarithmic divergent integrals, with suitable dimensionful coecients
(m2 in our example) maintaining the correctness of powercounting. this has
far reaching consequences: it allows to add zero in a suitable manner to each
feynman integrand to dispense with all appearances of overlapping divergences,
as exemplied by the following instructive example:

z

ddk
[2]z

ddl
[2]z

(k2 + m2)(k + l)2l2 = z

ddk
[2]z

[2]z (cid:20)

m2

(k2 + m2)k2(k + l)2l2(cid:21) ,

where the lhs and rhs are equal using an addition of

0 = z z

ddk
[2]z

ddl
[2]z

1

k2(k + l)2l2 .

in a regularization using a dimensionful parameter, such a simplication would
not appear until one uses the hopf algebra structure to realize that terms which
do not depend on dimensionful parameters drop out at the end of the calculation
in ratios of the form sr . hence, in dim.reg. we already obtain at the level of
bare diagrams a decomposition of amplitudes into functions representing rooted
trees, hence the desired representation in terms of elements of the decorated
butcher group gk.
