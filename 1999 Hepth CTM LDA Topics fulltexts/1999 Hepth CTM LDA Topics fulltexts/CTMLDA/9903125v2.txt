abstract

we present the evidence that (1)fl is a nonperturbative symmetry of type ii
string theory. we argue that (1)fl is a symmetry of string theory as much as
the sl(2, z) of the type ii string is and how the branes are mapped under the
(1)fl modding. ns branes are mapped into the ns branes with the same world
volume dimensions but with the dierent chiral structure. supersymmetric dp-

branes (bound with anti-dp branes) are mapped to unstable nonsupersymmetric
dp-branes, which has d(p1)-branes as kink solutions according to horava[1].

in duality of string theory, it is known that s-duality and orbifolding do not always

commute[2, 3]. one example is the relation between the worldsheet orientation reversal 
and (1)fl which ips the sign of the left-moving ramond sector. in many of the situations
 and (1)fl are s-dual operations[3]. since type iib string theory is self-dual, we expect
that by modding out by  and (1)fl respectively, we obtain the new dual pair. however,
this does not hold. type iib modded by  gives rise to type i string theory while type
iib modded by (1)fl is the type iia string theory. there are two important dierences
in the above example. type iib string modded by (1)fl is a typical example of the
orbifold of the closed string theory while type i string theory is not an orbifold of the closed

string theory. instead of the twisted sector, in type i string theory d-branes are introduced

for the cancellation of the tadpole. thus the non-perturbative states are introduced for the

consistency of the theory but the rule of introducing the suitable d-branes are quite dierent

from that obtaining the twisted sectors of the orbifold[6]. a related fact is that we obtain
the other half of the gravitini with dierent chirality in the twisted sector in (1)fl orbifold,
while the half of the gravitini are projected out by the presence of the d-branes in type i

theory.

the recent paper by hull and the subsequent papers[4, 5] shed some light on this puzzle.

he gives some evidence for the existence of ns-9 branes and argues that we can obtain
so(32) heterotic string if we consider the type iib modded by (1)fl in the background
of 32 ns-9 branes. since this is the string theory in the background of non-perturbative

states and we do not have the sucient understanding of the conformal eld theory of ns

branes, we cannot immediately prove or rule out this claim. also the existence of ns-9

branes are still problematic, since there are no charges of the perturbative type ii string

to couple to ns-9 branes. but some of the arguments are plausible, at least if we assume

the existence of ns-9 branes. in analogy with the type i theory as a string theory with

the nonperturbative background, we can imagine that we should not introduce the twisted

sector as in the orbifold case. also the presence of the ns-9 brane breaks the half of the

supersymmetry if the ns-9 branes is a supersymmetric object forming a sl(2, z) doublet
with d-9 brane. in his paper[4], hull raises one interesting issue. he claims that (1)fl
is a full non-perturbative symmetry of the type iib in the presence of ns-9 branes and he
shows how (1)fl acts on non-perturbative states. this begs the question: can we dene
(1)fl as a non-perturbative symmetry of type ii string theory without the presence of ns-9

1

branes? the purpose of this paper is to show some armative evidences for this question.
in particular we argue that (1)fl is a nonperturbative symmetry as much as sl(2, z) is
one of type iib theory. we shall see how (1)fl acts on ns branes and d-branes of type
ii theory. thus we give some evidence that type iib modded out by (1)fl is a type iia
string theory in a full nonperturbative sense.

in m-theory, if (1)fl corresponds to a full non-perturbative symmetry, then (1)fl
corresponds to the operation x 11  x 11 and a  a where x 11 is the eleventh-circle
whose size is related to the coupling constant of type iia string theory and a is the 3-form
of the 11-d supergravity. the combined operation of (1)fl and the orientation reversal
r9 which acts as x 9  x 9 and a  a is mapped to a generator of sl(2, z) of type
iib theory under the correspondence of m-theory on t 2 and type iib on a circle. thus
the claim that (1)fl is a full nonperturbative symmetry is equivalent to the self-duality of
type iib-theory together with the consistency of the perturbative string theory. if (1)fl
is not a full nonperturbative symmetry, then all facts of string dualities are in danger, which

is clearly implausible.

since we know how (1)fl acts on perturbative states, it is interesting to see how (1)fl
acts on nonperturbative states of type ii theory. let us rst start with ns-5 branes. for

this purpose we can recall the fact that type iia(iib) theory on ak1 singularities can be

mapped to type iib(iia) k coincident ns-5 branes via t-duality[7]. if we consider k kaluza-

klein monopole congurations in type iia(iib) side, the transverse geometry is described
by (r3  s1)/zk in the coincidence limit. the conguration has u(1) isometry and we can
t-dualize along the u(1)-direction, which gives us ns-5 branes in type iib(iia) side. by
the explicit calculation at the orbifold point t 4/z2 of k3, we can see that type iia theory on
k3 is mapped to type iib on k3 under (1)fl. since ak1 singular point can be obtained
by a suitable noncompact limit of k3, we can conclude that type iia(iib) ns-5 branes are

mapped to type iib(iia) ns-5 branes. from this consideration, we see that the chirality

of ns-5 branes are related to that of type ii string theory. probably the conformal eld

theory describing the ns-5 brane has the dierent gso projection in nsr formalism, which

leads to dierent chiral structure. this is true of the conformal eld theory describing the

near horizon geometry of ns-5 brane in type ii theory[8, 9]. the worldsheet fermions of

the conformal eld theory are free and dierent gso projections for left-moving and right-

moving fermions lead to the dierent chiral structure of type iia and type iib ns-5 branes

2

in the near horizon limit. same thing happens for the ns-1 brane, i.e., the fundamental

string and we expect the similar for ns-9 branes.

now we turn into d-branes of type ii string theory. if we consider a d-p brane whose
worldvolume spans x0, x1,   , xp, the suitable boundary condition at the worldsheet for the
bosonic coordinates are given by

nx  = 0  = 0,   , p

x  = constant  = p + 1,   , 9

(1)

(2)

where n is the derivative normal to the boundary of the worldsheet. this should be supple-

mented by a suitable boundary condition for the fermionic coordinates. since the boundary
condition (1) does not change under (1)fl, it seems that a dp-brane of type iia(iib) is
mapped to a dp-brane of type iib(iia). an immediate problem is that type iib string

theory has supersymmetric d-branes with even dimension of worldvolume while type iia

string theory has supersymmetric ones with odd dimension of worldvolume. thus its not

clear how to obtain supersymmetric d-branes of type iia(iib) starting from type iib(iia)

supersymmetric d-branes. one clue comes from a recent paper by horava[1]. he showed

that in type iia side, all stable d-brane conguration can be constructed as a bound state

of unstable type iia d9-branes. however at this point we note that its not natural to study
the action of (1)fl on a single d9 brane as under this operation it will naturally trans-
form to anti-d9 brane. therefore we will study the action of (1)fl on the gso invariant
boundary state and from there create brane congurations which are invariant under this

operation. thus we will show that a type iib d9 brane- anti d9 brane is mapped to the

type iia d9 brane. from here we can recover all stable d-brane congurations in the type

iia theory. to start, we represent a d9-brane as a boundary state using open-closed string

duality[10]. since the boundary state is made up of the closed string perturbative states, we
can easily gure out how (1)fl acts on the boundary state.

the boundary state corresponding to d9-brane in the light cone gauge following the

convention of [11] is given by,

where  = , n is an integer and r is a half-integer for nsns sector and an integer for
rr sector. the oscillator without tilde represents the right mover and the one with tilde

represents the left mover.

|b,  >(0) denotes the fock vacuum with zero momentum state.
this species the unique state for nsns sector. rr sector is more subtle due to the fermionic

zero modes, which we will discuss shortly. the boundary state is invariant under the type

where (1)f and (1) f ips the sign of

r. we take | >(0)n sn s |0 >n sn s to

r and 

(1)f|b,  >n sn s= (1) f|b,  >n sn s= |b, >n sn s .

the gso invariant conguration is

respectively where

thus the gso invariant state is given by

note that the sign of (1)f in (5) and (10) is the same as (1) f for the boundary state and
the resulting boundary state survives type iib gso projection.

now if we take the (1)fl, nsns boundary state is invariant while rr part is projected
out since the sign of the d-brane charges are ipped under (1)fl and the sign of the
rr charge is related to the relative sign between nsns boundary state and rr boundary

state[12]. thus in the untwisted sector only nsns part survives. the twisted boundary

condition is the same for nsns sector, but the gso projection for the rr sector is changed

into

(1 + (1)f )(1  (1) f ).

(13)
by construction, the sign of (1)f is the same as that of (1) f for |b+ >rr and |b >rr.
thus no linear combination of these survive the gso projection in the twisted sector. thus
we just have nsns boundary state under (1)fl, which is exactly the type iia d9-brane
state of horava. now in the original iib theory this nsns boundary state is nothing but a

bound state of d9, anti d9 system. therefore we see that a d9, anti d9 system of type iib
theory goes to an unstable d9 brane of type iia3. by similar calculation using the boundary

state corresponding to dp brane, one can show that type iib dp, anti dp brane system for
odd p is mapped to type iia dp brane under (1)fl. if type iia dp brane is unstable,
type iia supersymmetric d-(p-1) brane emerges as a kink solution of dp brane[1].
