abstract

we consider non-perturbative six dimensional n = 1 space-time supersym-
metric orientifolds of type iib on k3 with non-trivial ns-ns b-ux. all of
these models are non-perturbative in both orientifold and heterotic pictures.
thus, some states in such compactications arise in twisted open string
sectors which lack world-sheet description in terms of d-branes. we also dis-
cuss their dual f-theory compactications on certain voisin-borcea orbifolds.
in particular, the explicit construction of non-perturbative k3 orientifolds
with ns-ns b-ux gives additional evidence for the conjectured extension of
nikulins classication in the context of voisin-borcea orbifolds.

in the recent years various six (see, e.g., [14]) and four (see, e.g., [512]) dimensional
orientifold vacua have been constructed. in many cases the world-sheet approach to orien-
tifolds is adequate and gives rise to consistent anomaly free vacua in six and four dimensions.
however, there are cases where the perturbative orientifold description misses certain non-
perturbative sectors giving rise to massless states [11,13,14]. in certain cases this inadequacy
results in obvious inconsistencies such as lack of tadpole and anomaly cancellation. exam-
ples of such cases were discussed in [911]. in other cases, however, the issue is more subtle
as the non-perturbative states arise in anomaly free combinations, so that they are easier to
miss.

recently such non-perturbative orientifolds have been studied in detail in [13,14].

in
particular, six and four dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric non-perturbative orientifolds
have been constructed in [13,14] using type i-heterotic duality and the map between type
iib orientifolds and f-theory as guiding principles. the discussion in [13,14] was (mainly)
conned to orientifolds with trivial ns-ns b-ux. the purpose of this note is to extend
the results of [13,14] to compactications with non-trivial ns-ns b-eld turned on.
in
particular, here we will focus on six dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric non-perturbative
orientifolds of type iib on k3 with non-trivial ns-ns b-ux.

the origin of non-perturbative states in orientifold compactications can be understood
as follows. thus, in the k3 orbifold examples of [3] the orientifold projection is not , which
we will use to denote that in the smooth k3 case, but rather j , where j  maps the g
twisted sector to its conjugate g1 twisted sector (assuming g2 6= 1) [15]. geometrically
this can be viewed as a permutation of two p1s associated with each xed point of the
(more precisely, these p1s correspond to the orbifold blow-ups.) this is
orbifold [11].
dierent from the orientifold projection in the smooth case where (after blowing up) the
orientifold projection does not permute the two p1s.
in the case of the j  projection
the twisted open string sectors corresponding to the orientifold elements j g are absent
[16,11]. however, if the orientifold projection is , then the twisted open string sectors
corresponding to the orientifold elements g are present [11].
in fact, these states are
non-perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint and are required for gravitational anomaly
cancellation in six dimensions. this can be explicitly seen from the construction of non-
perturbative k3 orientifolds without the b-ux in [13,14].

the eect of turning on non-trivial ns-ns b-ux in the perturbative (that is, un-
twisted) open string sectors is as follows. first, the rank of the gauge group is reduced by
2b/2 [17], where b is the rank of the matrix bij (i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4 label the compact directions
corresponding to k3). note that b is always an even integer, and in the case of k3 compact-
ications can take values b = 0, 2, 4. second, the multiplicity of the 59 open string sector
states (if present) is no longer 1 (as in the case without the b-eld), but 2b/2 [4]. note that
the b-eld is quantized in half-integer units (here we are using the normalization where the
b-eld is dened modulo integer shifts) [17,4].

the eect of the ns-ns b-ux in the non-perturbative (that is, twisted) open string
sectors is a bit more non-trivial. the point here is that type i-heterotic duality was an
important guiding principle in determining the twisted open string sector spectrum of non-
perturbative k3 orientifolds (e.g., in the case of the z3 orbifold limit of k3) without the
b-ux [13].
in particular, in certain cases the corresponding heterotic dual is perturba-
tive, which enables one to understand the non-perturbative sectors on the orientifold side.

2

however, as was pointed out in [13], once we turn on the b-eld, the above property is
no longer there - the heterotic duals in these cases are no longer perturbative. this makes
understanding twisted open string sectors in the presence of the b-ux more involved.

nonetheless, it turns out that there is a way around this diculty. the key simpli-
cation here is due to the observation of [7,18] that turning on the b-eld in an orientifold
compactication is equivalent to turning on non-commuting wilson lines. let us be more
precise here. for the sake of deniteness let us consider a compactication on a two-torus
t 2. as was explained in detail in [18], turning on (quantized) b-led of rank b = 2 on t 2
is equivalent to modding out by the following freely acting orbifold. thus, let us turn on
two z2 valued wilson lines on t 2 - one corresponding to the a-cycle of t 2, and the other
one corresponding to the b-cycle. each of these wilson lines can be described as a freely
acting z2 orbifold which amounts to shifting the t 2 lattice by a half-lattice shift along the
corresponding cycle of t 2. in the closed string sector the eect of non-zero b-eld then
corresponds to having non-trivial discrete torsion between the generators, call them g1 re-
spectively g2, of the two z2 subgroups. in the open string sector each z2 has a non-trivial
action on the corresponding chan-paton charges. this action is described by the 16  16
chan-paton matrices1 g1 respectively g2. the eect of non-zero b-eld in the open string
sector then corresponds to having non-commuting chan-paton matrices: g1g2 = g2g1.
that is, even though the (freely acting) orbifold group is z2  z2 (with discrete torsion), the
corresponding embedding in the chan-paton charges is in terms of the non-abelian dihedral
group d4 (see [18] for details).

it is now clear how to deal with turning on the b-eld in the twisted open string sectors.
we start with the cases without the b-eld, which have been understood in [13,14], and
then mod out by the above freely acting orbifold with the corresponding action on the chan-
paton charges. this procedure is relatively straightforward to carry out, albeit there are
some technical subtleties (such as the fact that various relative signs in the corresponding
projections require some care) one encounters in the process. one also must take into
account not only the original twisted sectors modded out by the above action, but also the
additional sectors corresponding to xed points of the k3 orbifold group element (which is
a pure twist) accompanied by the z2  z2 shifts. for the sake of brevity here we will skip
(most of) the details of the derivation of the corresponding massless spectra, and simply
summarize the results in various tables. we will, however, make various clarifying remarks
as we discuss the corresponding models.

thus, consider type iib on m2 = t 4/zn , where the generator g of zn , n = 2, 3, 4, 6,

acts on the complex coordinates z1, z2 on t 4 as follows:

gz1 = z1 ,

gz2 = 1z2 ,

(1)

where   exp(2i/n). this theory has n = 2 supersymmetry in six dimensions.

next, we consider the  orientifold of this theory. note that, as we have already men-
tioned in the previous section, the  projection acts as in the smooth k3 case. this, in
particular, implies that we must rst blow up the orbifold singularities before orientifolding.

1here we work with 16  16 (rather than 32  32) chan-paton matrices for we choose not to count
the orientifold images of the corresponding d-branes.

3

after orientifolding the closed string sector contains the n = 1 supergravity multiplet in six
dimensions plus the usual tensor supermultiplet. we also have some number nc
h of closed
string sector hypermultiplets plus some number ent of extra tensor multiplets. note that
nc
h + ent = 20 (this follows from the fact that before orientifolding in the n = 1 language we
have 20 hypermultiplets and 20 tensor multiplets associated with k3). the precise values
of nc
h and ent , however, depend on the order of the orbifold group n as well as the rank b
of the b-eld.

thus, in the z2 case the untwisted closed string sector gives rise to 4 hypermultiplets only.
the z2 twisted closed string sector produces 16 hypermultiplets and no tensor multiplets
for b = 0, 12 hypermultiplets and 4 tensor multiplets for b = 2, and 10 hypermultiplets and
6 tensor multiplets for b = 4. this can be seen as follows [4]. consider a special point in
the moduli space where the t 4 lattice is that of so(8). in this case the rank of the b-eld
b = 2. for this special lattice the z2 twist can be rewritten in terms of lattice shifts (see
[4] for details), and in the latter language it is straightforward to see that 12 xed points
are symmetric under the action of , whereas 4 of them are antisymmetric. the above
conclusion for the b = 4 case then follows by considering the four-torus of the factorized
form t 2  t 2 and turning on rank 2 b-eld in each t 2. for each t 2 the symmetric and
antisymmetric xed points can be deduced from the b = 2 case discussed above as follows.
first consider the case where we have t 2  t 2 with rank 2 b-eld in the rst t 2 and no
b-eld in the second t 2. then the second t 2 gives 4 xed points which are symmetric
under . since we know that we must have total of 12 symmetric and 4 antisymmetric xed
points for b = 2, it then follows that the rst t 2 gives 3 symmetric and 1 antisymmetric
xed points. now it is clear that in the case where both t 2s have rank 2 b-eld turned on,
there are total 10 symmetric and 6 antisymmetric xed points.

next, let us consider other zn cases with n = 3, 4, 6. in the untwisted sector we have 2
hypermultiplets and no tensor multiplets. for n = 4, 6 we have the z2 twisted sector. as
was discussed in [4], after the appropriate projections, in the z2 sector we have: 10 symmetric
and no antisymmetric xed points for n = 4, b = 0; 8 symmetric and 2 antisymmetric xed
points for n = 4, b = 2; 7 symmetric and 3 antisymmetric xed points for n = 4, b = 4; 6
symmetric and no antisymmetric xed points for n = 6 and all three values of b = 0, 2, 4.
finally, in the zn twisted sectors with n = 3, 4, 6 the xed points are always symmetric
under . this can be seen, say, for the z3 case by going to the special point in the moduli
space where t 4 factorizes as t 2  t 2 with each t 2 corresponding to the su(3) lattice. in
this case each t 2 has rank 2 b-eld turned on. for the su(3) lattice the z3 twist can be
rewritten in terms of the corresponding z3 valued shift, and then it is not dicult to see
that all three xed points in each t 2 are symmetric under .

putting all of the above together, we conclude that for the non-perturbative  orientifolds
h = 16, ent = 4 for
h = 20, ent = 0 for n = 3, 6, b = 0, 2, 4;
h = 17, ent = 3 for

of type iib on k3 we have: nc
n = 2, b = 2; nc
nc
h = 20, ent = 0 for n = 4, b = 0; nc
n = 4, b = 4. this is reected in the corresponding tables.

h = 18, ent = 2 for n = 4, b = 2; nc

h = 20, ent = 0 for n = 2, b = 0; nc

h = 14, ent = 6 for n = 2, b = 4; nc

let us now turn to the open string sector.

in the z3 case the twisted chan-paton
matrices are completely xed by the tadpole cancellation conditions for each value of b.
the corresponding perturbative spectra can be found in [4]. as to the non-perturbative
z3 twisted 99 open string sector, in the b = 0 case it was given in [13]. to obtain the

4

corresponding non-perturbative sector states for b = 2, 4, we mod out by the freely acting
orbifold action discussed above. the massless spectra of the z3 non-perturbative orientifolds
with various values of b are summarized in table i.

in the zn cases with n = 2, 3, 4 the tadpole cancellation conditions do not uniquely
x the twisted chan-paton matrices. more precisely, in the z2 case with b = 0 we have a
unique (up to equivalent representations) solution for r, where r is the generator of z2:

r = diag(ii8, ii8) ,

(2)

where in denotes the unit n  n matrix. (note that the action of the orbifold group on
the d9- and d5-branes is similar.) however, as pointed out in [14], for b 6= 0 we have two
solutions:

r = diag(ii23b/2, ii23b/2) ,
r = diag(i23b/2, i23b/2) ,

(3)
(4)

where the rst solution corresponds to the case without vector structure, whereas the second
solution corresponds to the case with vector structure [14].

in the z2 case there are no non-perturbative twisted open string sectors, and the corre-
sponding massless spectra for various values of b can be found in [4] for the cases without
vector structure, and in [13] for the cases with vector structure. here we will therefore focus
on the z4 and z6 cases with and without vector structure.
in the cases without vector
structure the corresponding twisted massless spectra can be worked out by starting from
the b = 0 case and modding out by the freely acting orbifold action discussed above. the
resulting massless spectra for the z4 orbifold models are given in table i. in table ii we
summarize the massless spectra for the z6 orbifold models without vector structure. note
that all of these models satisfy the gravitational anomaly cancellation condition [19]

nh  nv = 273  29nt ,

(5)

where nh, nv and nt are the total numbers of hypermultiplets, vector multiplets and tensor
multiplets, respectively. (note that nt = ent + 1.)

next, we turn to the z4 and z6 cases with vector structure. here we must have b = 2
or 4. note that the perturbative open string spectrum of the z6 model with b = 2 with
vector structure is the same as that of the z6 model with b = 2 without vector structure
[14]. in fact, it is not dicult to show that the non-perturbative twisted open string spectra
are also the same in these two cases. the massless spectrum of the z6 case with b = 4 with
vector structure is summarized in table iii. finally, the massless spectra of the z4 models
with b = 2 and b = 4 with vector structure are also given in table iii. note that all of the
models in table iii also satisfy the gravitational anomaly cancellation condition (5).

in the remainder of this note we would like to discuss f-theory duals of the above
non-perturbative orientifolds with ns-ns b-ux.
in order to understand these f-theory
compactications, we will take an indirect route. let us further compactify a given non-
perturbative k3 orientifold on t 2. the resulting four dimensional model has n = 2 su-
persymmetry. let us go to a generic point in the moduli space where the gauge group
is maximally higgsed (so that the gauge group is either completely broken or consists of

5

abelian factors only). let r(v ) be the number of open string vector multiplets after hig-
gsing. then the total number of vector multiplets is given by r(v ) + nt + 2, where nt is
the number of tensor multiplets in six dimensions. let h 0 be the number of hypermulti-
plets neutral with respect to the left-over abelian gauge group (if any). then, if we assume
that the resulting four dimensional model has a type iia dual, the hodge numbers of the
corresponding calabi-yau three-fold are given by [20]:
h1,1 = r(v ) + nt + 2 ,
h2,1 = h 0  1 .

(6)
(7)

using various dualities between type iia, heterotic, type i and f-theory, it is not dicult
to see that these calabi-yau three-folds must be elliptically bered, and f-theory compact-
ications on these spaces should be dual to the original six dimensional orientifold models.
in the table below we give the hodge (and euler) numbers of the calabi-yau three-folds for
the perturbative (that is, j ) k3 orientifolds as well as non-perturbative (that is, ) k3
orientifolds with various values of b (note that in the z2 case the j  and  orientifolds are
equivalent as the action of j  is trivial):

note that the above table covers the cases with and without vector structure alike. in the
fourth column we have displayed the euler number  = 2(h1,1  h2,1). the meaning of the
last column will become clear in a moment.

all of the above calabi-yau three-folds correspond to voisin-borcea orbifolds [21,22] (for
a physicists discussion, see, e.g., [23,24]). here we will therefore briey review some facts
about voisin-borcea orbifolds.

6

thus, let w2 be a k3 surface (which is not necessarily an orbifold of t 4) which admits
an involution j such that it reverses the sign of the holomorphic two-form dz1  dz2 on w2.
consider the following quotient:

y3 = (t 2  w2)/y ,

(8)

where y = {1, s}  z2, and s acts as sz0 = z0 on t 2 (z0 being a complex coordinate
on t 2), and as j on w2. this quotient, known as a voisin-borcea orbifold, is a calabi-
yau three-fold with su(3) holonomy which is elliptically bered over the base b2 = w2/b,
where b = {1, j}  z2.

nikulin gave a classication [25] of possible involutions of k3 surfaces in terms of three in-
variants (r, a, ). the result of this classication is plotted in fig.1 (which has been borrowed
from [11]) according to the values of r and a. the open and closed circles correspond to the
cases with  = 0 and  = 1, respectively. (the cases denoted by  are outside of nikulins
classication, and we will discuss them shortly.) in the case (r, a, ) = (10, 10, 0) the base b2
is an enriques surface, and the corresponding y3 has hodge numbers (h1,1, h2,1) = (11, 11).
in all the other cases the hodge numbers are given by:

h1,1 = 5 + 3r  2a ,
h2,1 = 65  3r  2a .

(9)
(10)

for (r, a, ) = (10, 10, 0) the z2 twist s is freely acting (that is, it has no xed points).
for (r, a, ) = (10, 8, 0) the xed point set of s consists of two curves of genus 1. the base
b2 in this case is p2 blown up at 9 points. in all the other cases the xed point set of s
consists of one curve of genus g plus k rational curves, where

g =

k =

1

(22  r  a) ,

(r  a) .

(11)

(12)

note that except for the cases with a = 22  r, r = 11, . . . , 20, the mirror pair of y3 is
given by the voisin-borcea orbifold ey3 with er = 20  r, ea = a. under the mirror transform
we have: eg = f , ef = g, where f  k + 1.

in the cases a = 22  r, r = 11, . . . , 20, the mirror would have to have er = 20  r
and ea = a = er + 2, where er = 0, . . . , 9. we have depicted these cases in fig.2 using the
 symbol.
in particular, we have plotted cases with a = r + 2, r = 0, . . . , 10. the
hodge numbers for these cases are still given by (9) and (10) (which follows from their
denition as mirror pairs of the cases with a = 22  r, r = 11, . . . , 20). (this is true for
a = r + 2, r = 0, . . . , 9. extrapolation to r = 10 is motivated by the fact that in this
case we get (h1,1, h2,1) = (11, 11) which is the same as for (r, a, ) = (10, 10, 0).) in [11] it
was argued that these voisin-borcea orbifolds also exist, albeit they are singular. in fact,
some of them can be constructed explicitly (see [11] for details). for instance, the case with
r = 2, a = 4 has hodge numbers (h1,1, h2,1) = (3, 51), which correspond to the singular
calabi-yau realized as the z2  z2 orbifold with discrete torsion [26].

as we have already mentioned, here we would like to briey review f-theory compact-
ications on voisin-borcea orbifolds (which correspond to n = 1 supersymmetric vacua

7

in six dimensions). thus, consider f-theory on y3 with (r, a, ) 6= (10, 10, 0) or (10, 8, 0).
this gives rise to the following massless spectrum in six dimensions. the number of tensor
multiplets is t = r  1. the number of neutral hypermultiplets is h = 22  r. the gauge
group is so(8)  so(8)k. there are g adjoint hypermultiplets of the rst so(8). there
are no hypermultiplets charged under the other k so(8)s. under mirror symmetry g and
f = k + 1 are interchanged. thus, the vector multiplets in the adjoint of so(8)k are traded
for g  1 hypermultiplets in the adjoint of the rst so(8). that is, gauge symmetry turns
into global symmetry and vice-versa. this can be pushed further to understand f-theory
compactications on calabi-yau three-folds with a = r + 2, r = 1, . . . , 10, which give the
following spectra. the number of tensor multiplets is t = r  1. there are h = 22  r
neutral hypermultiplets. in addition there are g = 10  r hypermultiplets transforming as
adjoints under a global so(8) symmetry. there are no gauge bosons, however. it is not
dicult to verify that this massless spectrum is free of gravitational anomalies in six dimen-
sions. in fact, in [11] it was conjectured that all of these singular calabi-yau three-folds
exist, and f-theory compactications on these singular spaces are equivalent to f-theory
compactications on smooth calabi-yau three-folds according to the following relation [11]:

f-theory on y3 with (h1,1, h2,1) = (r + 1, 61  5r) is equivalent to
f-theory on by3 with (h1,1, h2,1) = (r + 1, 301  29r) (r = 1, . . . , 9) .

(13)

thus, for instance, for r = 2 we get (h1,1, h2,1) = (3, 243), which is the elliptic calabi-yau
given by the t 2 bration over the base p1  p1.

in the above discussion of perturbative k3 orientifolds we have encountered calabi-yau
three-folds with the hodge numbers (h1,1, h2,1) = (3, 243), (7, 127), (9, 69), (10, 40), and also
(h1,1, h2,1) = (20, 14), (16, 10) (see the above table). the last two cases are within nikulins
classication, and correspond to (r, a) = (11, 9) and (11, 11), respectively. the rst four
cases, however, are outside of nikulins classication, and correspond to the above calabi-
yau three-folds by3 (whose hodge numbers are given by (h1,1, h2,1) = (r + 1, 301  r)) with
r = 2, 6, 8, 9, respectively. the cases r = 6, 8 were originally discussed in [27]. in fact, in [28]
the calabi-yau three-fold with (h1,1, h2,1) = (7, 127) (corresponding to r = 6) was explicitly
constructed. here we also have an additional case with r = 9. the fact that perturbative
k3 orientifolds with ns-ns b-eld are consistent string backgrounds gives evidence for the
conjectured extension of nikulins classication.

in fact, in our discussion of non-perturbative k3 orientifolds we have encountered four
new cases: (h1,1, h2,1) = (5, 185), (6, 156), and (h1,1, h2,1) = (11, 59), (7, 55). the rst two
cases correspond to the by3 three-folds with r = 4, 5, respectively. our construction of non-
perturbative k3 orientifolds with the ns-ns b-ux therefore gives additional evidence for
the above conjecture. as to the other two cases, they correspond to voisin-borcea orbifolds
(within nikulins classication) with (r, a) = (2, 0) (in this case the base is the hirzebruch
surface f4) respectively (r, a) = (2, 2) (in which case the base is either f0 or f1).

before we end this note, we would like to point out that, having understood non-
perturbative k3 orientifolds with ns-ns b-ux, it is now straightforward to construct
non-perturbative orientifolds on t 6/ orbifolds with su(3) holonomy in the presence of
ns-ns b-ux along the lines of [13,14].

n = 3, 4 with the ns-ns b-eld of rank b. the semi-colon in the column charged hypermul-
tiplets separates 99 and 55 representations. the subscript u  indicates that the corresponding
(untwisted) state is perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint. the subscript t  indicates
that the corresponding (twisted) state is non-perturbative from the orientifold viewpoint. the
u (1) charges are not shown, and by neutral hypermultiplets we mean that the corresponding
