abstract

open groups whose generators are in arbitrary involutions may be quantized within
a ghost extended framework in terms of a nilpotent bfv-brst charge operator.
previously we have shown that generalized quantum maurer-cartan equations for
arbitrary open groups may be extracted from the quantum connection operators and
that they also follow from a simple quantum master equation involving an extended
nilpotent bfv-brst charge and a master charge. here we give further details of these
results. in addition we establish the general structure of the solutions of the quantum
master equation. we also construct an extended formulation whose properties are
determined by the extended brst charge in the master equation.

introduction

lie groups are dominant continuous transformations in theoretical physics. however, there
are important models in which more general kinds of continuous transformations enter.
for instance, the gauge transformations in eld theories like gravity, supergravity and p-
branes are not lie groups. open groups whose generators are in arbitrary involutions are
very dicult to handle. the only framework in which they can be treated systematically in
quantum theory is within a ghost extended brst frame. this is consistent when the group
algebra may be imbedded in a nilpotent brst charge following the bfv-prescription [1].
representations of open groups are then naturally classied in terms of ranks [1]. ordinary
nonabelian lie groups are of rank 1. the gauge group of supergravity has rank 2 [2], and
that of p-branes rank p [3].

in [4] we investigated the properties of group transformed operators for arbitrary open
groups within the bfv-brst-scheme [1]. by means of a particular representation of the
operator connections in the lie equations for the transformed operators, we arrived at
generalized maurer-cartan equations expressed in terms of the quantum antibracket in-
troduced in [5]. furthermore, we presented a new type of quantum master equation, also
expressed in terms of the quantum antibracket, which we proposed to encode these gener-
alized maurer-cartan equations. here we give further details of these results. in addition
we establish the general structure of the solutions of the quantum master equation. we
also construct an extended formulation whose properties are determined by the extended
brst charge in the master equation.

2 quantizing arbitrary involutions

consider a dynamical system with a nite number of degrees of freedom. let the phase
space (or the symplectic manifold), , for this system be spanned by the coordinates za.
thus, {za, zb} is an invertable matrix in terms of the poisson bracket. (locally za consists
of canonical conjugate pairs: qi, pi.) the generators of the open group under consideration
are functions on  denoted by a(z) with grassmann parities (a)  a(= 0, 1) satisfying
the lie algebra

{a(z), b(z)} = u c

ab (z)c(z).

(2.1)

as is well-known it is extremely dicult to construct a quantum theory in which the
corresponding commutator algebra to (2.1) is integrable when the structure coecients
u c
ab are functions on . the canonical procedure which makes this possible is to rst
extend the phase space  by ghost variables and then imbed the algebra (2.1) in one odd
real function  satisfying {, } = 0 in terms of the extended poisson bracket.  is
the bfv-brst charge [1]. the corresponding quantum theory is now consistent if the
corresponding odd, hermitian operator  is nilpotent, i.e. 2 = 0. for a nite number of
degrees of freedom such a solution always exists and is of the form [6] (n is the rank of
the theory. a are assumed to be hermitian operators.)

satisfying the properties

[ca, pb] = iha

(ca) = ca, p 

a = (1)apa.

all commutators are from now on graded commutators dened by

[a, b]  ab  ba(1)ab ,

where a and b are the grassmann parities of the operators a and b respectively. in (2.3)
the ghost operators are weyl ordered which means that i are all hermitian.  determines
the precise form of the quantum counterpart of the algebra (2.1). a convenient form of
this algebra is obtained if we rewrite  in the following cp-ordered form [6]

which shows that 
a(z) in general are dierent from a(z) and in general not even hermi-
tian. however, the main point here is that  through e.g. (2.7) represents the quantum
counterpart of (2.1).

all operators and states may be decomposed into operators and states with denite

ghost numbers. the ghost number g is dened by

g|aig = ihg|aig,

[g, ag] = ihgag,

(2.10)

where g is the hermitian ghost charge operator dened by

g

one may notice that  in (2.2) has ghost number one, i.e. [g, ] = ih.

in a brst-quantization which requires us to solve the brst cohomology resulting

from the brst condition

|physi = 0,

(2.12)

the original generators a in (2.1) are constraint variables which generate gauge transfor-
mations. within the brst quantization the gauge generators have a brst exact form,
i.e. they are of the form [, ]. the natural gauge generators are [, pa]. however, [, pa]
do not satisfy a closed algebra for higher rank theories (n = 2 and higher). on the other
hand, [, pa] and pa which constitute brst-doublets do always satisfy a closed algebra.

3 finite group transformations for open groups

we want now to integrate the quantum involution (2.1) encoded in  as represented by
e.g. (2.7). we consider therefore the lie equations for the group transformed states and
operators given by (cf [4])

ha()|



da ha()|(cid:18) 

a (ih)1ya()(cid:19) = 0,

a()


a a()


a (ih)1[a(), ya()] = 0,

(3.1)

(3.2)

where a is a derivative with respect to the group parameter a, (a) = a. the connec-
tion operator ya, which depends on a, must satisfy integrability conditions

a formal solution is


b yb


a (1)ab = (ih)1[ya, yb].

ya

ya()  ihu ()(cid:18)u 1()



a(cid:19) ,

which means that the group transformed states and operators are of the form

ha()| = ha|u 1(), a() = u ()au 1(),

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

where u () is a nite group element. u () must be an even operator and it is natural to
require it to satisfy the conditions

u (0) = 1,

[, u ()] = 0,

[g, u ()] = 0.

(3.6)

for an exponential representation this implies

u () = exp {

i
h

f ()}, f (0) = 0,

[, f ()] = 0,

[g, f ()] = 0.

(3.7)

the rst condition is just a choice of parametrization. the second condition is necessary
in order to be consistent with a brst quantization dened by (2.12). the last condi-
tion makes the group transformed state to have the same ghost number as the original

3

one. since in a brst quantization the gauge generators are represented by brst exact
operators it is natural to expect u () to have the form

u () = exp {(ih)2[, ()]},

(3.8)

where () has ghost number minus one. it could e.g. be ()  paa. ((3.7) requires
[, (0)] = 0.) it is of course natural for u () to be a unitary operator.

let us now go back to the lie equations (3.1) and (3.2). the conditions (3.6) applied

to the formal expression (3.4) for the connection operator ya implies that

[, ya] = 0,

[g, ya] = 0.

(3.9)

in terms of the exponential representation (3.7) we have also

ya() = z 1

0

d exp {



a(cid:19) exp {

i
h

f ()}.

(3.10)



i
h

f ()}(cid:18)f ()
a(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

in particular we have ya(0) = f ()

. from the natural representation (3.8) with

() = paa we have then ya(0) = [, pa] which are the natural gauge generators.

the representation (3.8) yields the general property

ya() = (ih)1[, a()],

(a) = a + 1,

(3.11)

where a has ghost number minus one. in fact, (3.8) suggests that

a() = z 1

0

d exp {(ih)2[, ()]}(cid:18)()



a(cid:19) exp {(ih)2[, ()]}.

(3.12)

the simplest ansatz () = paa implies that a() has the form

a() = b

a()pb + {possible ghost dependent terms},

a(0) = b
b
a,

(3.13)

where b
a() are operators in general. notice that a() is only dened up to brst
invariant operators from a given ya() exactly like () from a given f (). however,
since the only brst invariant operators with negative ghost numbers are brst exact
ones the arbitrariness is

a()  a() + (ih)1[, ka()],

()  () + (ih)1[, ()],

(3.14)

where ka() and () have ghost number minus two. if the relation (3.11) is applied to
the exponential representation (3.7) then we get from (3.10)

f ()


a= (ih)1[, ga()]  f () = f (0) + (ih)1[, ()],

(3.15)

where

() = z 1

0

dga()a + (ih)1[, ()].

(3.16)

4

(contract the rst relation in (3.15) with a and use the argument in appendix b.) the
operators ga() must satisfy the integrability conditions

ga()


b gb()


a (1)ab = (ih)1[, gab()],

(3.17)

where gab() in turn must satisfy the integrability conditions following from (3.17) and so
on. thus, if f (0) = 0 as required in (3.7) then the representation (3.8) follows from (3.11).
since the original algebra (2.1) is the algebra of the gauge group in a brst quantization
and this is the algebra we want to integrate the representation (3.11) of the connection
operator ya() is the natural one. the relation (3.11) was also the starting point in [4].
there we noticed that the integrability conditions (3.3) lead to a whole set of integrability
conditions for a(). the representation (3.11) inserted into (3.3) implies

[, a


b b


a (1)ab  (ih)2(a, b)] = 0,

(3.18)

where we have introduced the quantum antibracket dened in (a.1) in appendix a. (they
were introduced in [5, 7] and the relevant formulas are given in appendix a.) since the
right entry has ghost number minus one, it is zero up to a brst exact operator. we have
therefore [4]


b b


a (1)ab  (ih)2(a, b) +

a

1
2

(ih)1[ab, ] = 0,

(3.19)

where ab in general is a a-dependent operator with ghost number minus two. from
(3.19) one may then derive integrability conditions for ab which in turn introduces an
operator abc with ghost number minus three, when the -commutator is divided out.
thus, ya is replaced by a whole set of operators, and the integrability condition (3.3)
for ya is replaced by a whole set of integrability conditions for these operators. these
integrability conditions may be viewed as generalized maurer-cartan equations. in fact,
for lie groups we may choose

a = b

a()pb,

[a, b] = 0, ab = 0,

where b

a() only depends on a. in this case (3.19) reduces to

ac

b  bc

a(1)ab = e

ad

b u c

de(1)be+c+d+e , b

a(0) = b
a,

(3.20)

(3.21)

which are the classical maurer-cartan equations. in fact, (3.20) is also valid for quasigroup
rst rank theories [4]. we expect a nonzero ab to be necessary only for theories of rank
two and higher. that a weaker form of maurer-cartan equations is necessary for rank
two and higher should be connected to the fact that [, pa] then no longer satisfy a closed
algebra. however, notice that a nonzero ab is possible even in lie group theories due to
the ambiguity (3.14). the maurer-cartan equations (3.19) only retain their form under
the replacement (3.14) if we at the same time make the replacement

ab  ab +(cid:18)2(ka


b kb


a (1)ab) 

(ih)2((ka, b)  (kb, a)(1)ab)(cid:19)(1)a+b.

4 the quantum master equation

in [4] we proposed a quantum master equation for all the integrability conditions for the
-operators that follow from (3.3) and (3.11). all the -operators were there imbedded
in one master charge s. it is given by

s(, )  g + aa() +

[ n
2 ]

n 

xk=1

a2k +

[ n1
2 ]

xk=1

a2k1 a2k+1 ,

(4.1)

where g is the ghost charge operator dened in (2.11). the variables a, (a) = a + 1,
are new parameters which may be viewed as superpartners to a. the general sign factor
(1)n, which is dierent from the one in [4], makes the -operators have the symmetry
properties

n even or odd : a2ka2k+1 = a2k+1a2k(1)a2k1 a2k +a2k a2k+1 +a2k+1 a2k1 ,
n even : a2k+1a2k+2 = a2k+2a2k+1(1)a2k1 a2k+1 +a2k+1 a2k+2 +a2k+2 a2k1 ,
n odd : a2k1a2k = a2ka2k1(1)a2k1 a2k +a2k a2k+1 +a2k+1 a2k1 .
(4.2)

in addition the -operators satisfy the properties

(a1an) = a1 + . . . + an + n,

[g, a1an] = niha1an .

(4.3)

the last relation implies that a1an has ghost number minus n.
if we assign ghost
number one to a, generalizing the original ghost number, then s has ghost number zero.
the main conjecture in [4] was that the integrability conditions (3.19) together with those
that follow from (3.19) are contained in the quantum master equation

(s, s) = ih[, s],

where  is the extended nilpotent bfv-brst charge operator given by

    ihaa, 2 = 0,

(4.4)

(4.5)

 is odd and has extended ghost number one. the quantum antibracket (s, s) is dened
by (a.1) in appendix a with q replaced by . in terms of commutators it is

(s, s)  [[s, ], s].

the master equation (4.4) may therefore be written as

the explicit form of [s, ] is to the lowest orders in a

[s, [s, ]] = ih[s, ].

(4.6)

(4.7)

[s, ] = ih + a[a, ] + baa

(4.8)

when this is inserted into (4.7) we nd that the quantum master equation is satised
identically to zeroth and rst order in a. to second order in a it yields exactly (3.19),
and to the third order in a it yields

abc(1)ac +

8 n(ih)1[ab, c](1)ac + cycle(a, b, c)o ,

(4.9)

where we have introduced the higher quantum antibracket of order 3 dened by (a.8)
in appendix a with q replaced by , or equivalently by (a.11) in terms of the 2-
antibracket. in fact, (4.9) coincides with the integrability conditions of (3.19). (notice
that if ab = abc = 0, which we may have for rank one theories, a must satisfy the
condition (a, b, c) = 0. that this is satised we have checked up to quasigroups [4].)

the master equation (4.7) requires for consistency

[, (s, s)] = 0  [, s]2 = 0.

(4.10)

this property was also checked in [4] up to the third order in a. to the second order it
yields exactly (3.3).

formally we may introduce conjugate momenta, a and a, to the variables a and a.

we have then

[a, b] = iha
b ,

[a, b] = iha
b .

(4.11)

all derivatives with respect to a may then be replaced by a. the lie equations (3.1)-
(3.2) may e.g. be written as

ha()|(a  ya()) = 0,

[a(), a  ya()] = 0,

(4.12)

and the -operator (4.5) may be written as

   + aa(1)a.

(4.13)

(this form was used in [4].) the use of a is so far unclear since we have not used any
derivatives with respect to a. however, it allows us to dene a total ghost charge by

g  g 

1
2

(aa  aa(1)a ) ,

where g is the ghost charge (2.11). in terms of g we have

[ g, s] = 0,

[ g, ] = ih.

5 formal properties of the quantum master equation

let us dene the transformed operators s() and () by

s()  e

i

h f se i

h f , ()  e

i

h f e i

h f ,

(4.14)

(4.15)

(5.1)

7

where  is a real parameter and f an arbitrary even operator with total ghost number
zero since we require s() and () to have total ghost number zero and one. if s and
 satisfy the master equation (4.4), then it is easily seen that s() and () satisfy the
transformed master equation

(s(), s())() = ih[(), s()].

if we restrict f in (5.1) to satisfy the master equation (4.4), i.e.

(f, f ) = ih[, f ],

then () in (5.1) reduces to

() =  + (ih)1[, f ](1  e).

(5.2)

(5.3)

(5.4)

(notice that (5.3) implies () + () = 0.) for f = s we have then that s satises
the master equation (4.4) with  replaced by () in (5.4) where f = s.

there are also transformations on s leaving  unaected for which the master equation

(4.4) is invariant. from (5.1) this is the case if () =  which requires

[, f ] = 0.

(5.5)

in order for the transformed s to be in the form (4.1), f should not depend on a and a
in (4.11). if we assume that f (, ) may be given by a power series in a and a we nd
that (5.5) implies (the proof is given in appendix b)

f (, ) = f0 + (ih)1[, (, )],

(5.6)

where f0 = f (0, 0) and [, (, )]|==0 = 0.  is an odd operator with total ghost
number minus one which does not depend on a and a. (it has the form (b.10) in appendix
b.) an interesting consequence of the result (5.6) is that the extended brst singlets are
identical to the original brst singlets under  since [, f0] = [, f0] = 0. now although
the general invariance transformation on s is given by (5.1) with the f -operator (5.6), it is
natural and consistent to set f0 = 0 in which case we nd the following class of invariance
transformations [8]

s  s  exp(cid:26)(ih)2[, ](cid:27)s exp(cid:26)(ih)2[, ](cid:27),

(5.7)

this we view as the natural automorphism of the master equation (4.4). these trans-
formations leave the a = a = 0 component of s invariant in a trivial manner since
[, (, )]|==0 = 0. the innitesimal invariance transformations and their properties
following from (5.7) are

s = (ih)2[s, [, ]] = (ih)2(cid:18)(s, ) 
21s  (21  12)s = (ih)2[s, [, 21]] = (ih)2(cid:18)(s, 21) 

[, [, s]](cid:19),

21 = (ih)2(2, 1).

1
2

8

1
2

[, [21, s]](cid:19),

(5.8)

since s = g is a trivial solution of the master equation (4.4), we nd from (5.7) the

following expression for the master charge s in (4.1)

s = exp(cid:26)(ih)2[, ](cid:27)g exp(cid:26)(ih)2[, ](cid:27),

(5.9)

where  is the odd operator in (5.6) which has the form (b.10) in appendix b. this is the
general solution of the quantum master equation (4.4) within the class connected by the
transformations (5.7). the transformations (5.7) act transitivily on (5.9).

6 extended lie equations

the invariance transformations of the quantum master equation (4.4) which follow from
the transformation formulas (5.1) together with (5.5) suggest that we could dene extended
group elements by (cf.(3.7))

u (, )  exp {

i
h

f (, )},

[, f ] = 0,

[ g, f ] = 0,

(6.1)

where g is the extended ghost charge in (4.14). f (, ) is obviously given by (5.6).
interestingly enough u () = u (, )|=0 is equal to the general solution of (3.4) and
(3.11) which provides for another argument in favor of the quantum master equation.
now if we also require u (, ) to be a unit transformation at a = a = 0 exactly as in
(3.7) then the general solution is

u (, )  exp(cid:26)(ih)2[, (, )](cid:27),

(6.2)

which at a = 0 is identical to (3.8) if we make the identication ( , )|=0 = (). by
means of (6.2) we may then dene transformed states and operators by

h a(, )| = ha|u 1(, ),

a(, ) = u (, )au 1(, ),

(6.3)

which at a = 0 are the group transformed states and operators satisfying the lie equations
(3.1)-(3.2) where the operator connections (3.4) have the form (3.11).

also (6.3) are group transformed states and operators but under the extended group
elements (6.2) which are parametrized by the supersymmetric pairs of parameters a and
a. the states and operators in (6.3) satisfy the extended lie equations

h a(, )|

a(, )

where



da h a(, )|(cid:18) 

a (ih)1 ya(, )(cid:19) = 0,


a a(, )


a (ih)1[ a(, ), ya(, )] = 0,

ya(, ) = ihu (, )(cid:18)u 1(, )



a(cid:19) .

the expression (6.2) for u (, ) implies then that

ya(, ) = (ih)1[, a(, )],

(6.6)

where

a(, ) =

0

d exp {(ih)2[, (, )]}(cid:18)(, )



a(cid:19) exp {(ih)2[, (, )]}.

(6.7)

the general expression (5.9) for the master charge s implies in particular that the
master charge s itself is a group transformed ghost charge under the extended group
element (6.2) which means that it satisfy the lie equation

s(, )


a s(, )


a (ih)1[s(, ), ya(, )] = 0.

(6.8)

this equation together with the representation (6.6) of ya(, ) may be used to resolve
a(, ) in terms of s. we nd from (6.8) to the lowest order in a

a(, ) = a() +

1
2

b(cid:16)ba(1)a + (ih)1[b, a](cid:17) + . . .

however, this solution is not unique. the arbitrariness is

a  a + (ih)1[, ka],

(6.9)

(6.10)

which corresponds to the arbitrariness in (3.14) and (3.22). (the a0 limit yields (3.14).)
the relation between the extended group transformation and the nonextended one may
also be expressed in terms of the master charge s. we have

| a(, )i = v (, )|a()i,

a(, ) = v (, )a()v 1(, ),

(6.11)

where

since

we get

v (, ) = u (, )u 1().

7 some further properties of the extended states and oper-

ators

here we give some additional properties and interpretations of the results in section 6.
first we notice that if the original states and operators are eigenstates and eigenoperators

10

to the ghost charge g then the transformed states and operators in (6.3) are eigenstates
and eigenoperators to the master charge s, i.e.

s| aig = ihg| aig,

[s, ag] = ihg ag.

another property which follows from the representation (6.3) is

|ai = 0  | a(, )i = 0,
[, a] = 0  [, a(, )] = 0,

(7.1)

(7.2)

i.e. if the original states and operators are invariant under the brst charge , then the
extended states and operators are invariant under the extended brst charge .  should
of course be hermitian.

the extended brst charge  may be identied with the conventional brst charge
if a are identied with the lagrange multipliers and if a and a are identied with
antighosts and their conjugate momenta. although the group element u (, ) should be
unitary, there is an interesting interpretation of the extended states

| ai  u (, )|ai,

(7.3)

when u (, ) is hermitian. if we choose |ai to be independent of the conjugate momenta
pa to the ghosts, i.e.

ca|ai = 0,

(7.4)

then |ai = 0 and |ai = 0 which imply | ai = 0. in fact, the states in (7.3) are not
only brst invariant under  but they are also formal inner product states [9]. a hermi-
tian choice of  of the form   paa in the representation (6.2) of u in (7.3) leads to
inner product states with group geometric properties. in [10] such states were considered
for lie group theories.

appendix a

quantum antibrackets.

quantum antibrackets are algebraic tools like commutators which should be useful in any
quantum theory in which there are fundamental odd operators like in brst-quantization
of gauge theories and supersymmetric theories. so far they have only been applied to
gauge theories. they provide for an operator formulation of the bv-quantization [5, 8, 7].
here as in [4, 7] they are applied to the bfv-brst quantization.

11

the basic quantum antibracket is dened by [5]

(f, g)q 

1

2 (cid:16)[f, [q, g]]  [g, [q, f ]](1)(f +1)(g +1)(cid:17) ,

where f and g are any operators with grassmann parities (f )  f and (g)  g respec-
tively. q is an odd operator, (q) = 1. the commutators on the right-hand side is the
graded commutator (2.5). the quantum antibracket (a.1) satises the properties:

(a.1)

(a.2)

(a.3)

(a.4)

(a.5)

(a.6)

(a.7)

1) grassmann parity

2) symmetry

3) linearity

((f, g)q) = f + g + 1.

(f, g)q = (g, f )q(1)(f +1)(g +1).

(f + g, h)q = (f, h)q + (g, h)q,

(for f = g).

4) if one entry is an odd/even parameter  we have

(f, )q = 0 for any operator f.

5) the generalized jacobi identities (this general form was given in [7])

(f, (g, h)q)q(1)(f +1)(h+1) + cycle(f, g, h) =

=

(1)f +g+h(cid:26)(cid:18)[f, [g, [h, q2]]] +

[[f, [h, [g, q]]], q](cid:19) (1)h(f +g)(cid:27) + cycle(f, g, h),

6) and the generalized leibniz rule

(f g, h)q  f (g, h)q  (f, h)qg(1)g (h+1) =

1

=

2 (cid:16)[f, h][g, q](1)h(g+1) + [f, q][g, h](1)g(cid:17) .

the properties 1)-4) agree exactly with the corresponding properties of the classical an-
tibracket (f, g) for functions f and g. however, the classical antibracket satises in addi-
tion 6) and 7) where the right-hand side is zero. the right-hand side of (a.7) is zero if we
conne ourselves to a maximal set of commuting operators. they may e.g. be functions of
a basic set of commuting coordinate operators. the right-hand side of (a.6) is then zero if
q and q2 are at most quadratic in the conjugate momenta to these coordinate operators.
the classical antibracket is then nally obtained in the coordinate representation.

the quantum antibracket (a.1) is also useful for arbitrary operators. however, in this
case we need further algebraic tools represented by higher order quantum antibrackets
dened by [5, 7]

to (a.6).

appendix b

proof of (5.6).

following section 5 we let f (, ) be an operator which neither depends on a nor a
and which is given by a power expansion in a and a. we want to solve the condition
(5.5), i.e.

[, f (, )] = 0.

(b.1)

13

to this purpose we introduce the operators

  aa(1)a,

  aa(1)a,

with the properties

 has total ghost charge plus one and  minus one. we have then

() = () = 1, 2 = 2 = 0.

(b.2)

(b.3)

 =  + , n  (ih)1[, ] = aa + aa,

[n, ] = [n, ] = 0,

(b.4)

from which it follows that

(ih)1[n, f (, )] = (cid:18)a 

a + a 

a(cid:19)f (, ).

by commuting (b.1) with  and taking (b.4), (b.5) into account we get

(cid:18)a 

a + a 

a(cid:19)f (, ) = (ih)2[[f (, ), ], ].

next, let us make the following canonical transformation in (b.6):

a  a,
a  a,

a  a,
a  a,

where  is a parameter. then we get



d
d

f (, ) = (ih)2[[f (, ), ], ].

integration over  yields then

(b.5)

(b.6)

(b.7)

(b.8)

f (, ) = f (0, 0)  (ih)2[z 1

0

[, ]|==0 = 0,

d


[f (, ), ], ]  f (0, 0) + (ih)1[, ],

(b.9)

which is the assertion in (5.6). notice that  has the explicit form

(, ) = (ih)1z 1

0

d


[f (, ), ] + (ih)1[, k(, )],

(b.10)

where k(, ) is an arbitrary operator with total ghost number minus two and which
neither depends on a nor a. notice that

where fa() = (cid:18)f (, )



tions

0

(, )|=0 = z 1
a(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0



dfa()(1)a + (ih)1[, k(, 0)],

(b.11)

. (b.11) agrees exactly with (3.16) with the identica-

() = (, )|=0 , ga() = fa()(1)a ,

() = k(, 0).

(b.12)

the integrability conditions (3.17) of ga() are encoded in (b.9).

appendix c

a generalization.

consider the lie equations (3.1)-(3.2). if we require the connection operator ya to only
satisfy [, ya] = 0, then we have

where y (s)

a

is the brst singlet part of ya. the integrability conditions (3.3) imply then

ya = y (s)

a + (ih)1[, a],

(c.1)



b

y (s)
a

b y (s)
+(ih)1[,(cid:18)a
(cid:18)b

](cid:19) 
](cid:19) (1)ab  (ih)2(a, b)] = 0.

(c.2)


a (1)ab  (ih)1[y (s)
b (ih)1[a, y (s)



a

b

, y (s)

b

] +


a (1)ab  (ih)1[b, y (s)

a

these conditions are natural to split as follows

y (s)
a



b y (s)

b


a (1)ab  (ih)1[y (s)

(s)

a

(1)ab  (ih)2(a, b) = 

, y (s)

b

] = 0,

a

1
2

(ih)1[ab, ],

(c.3)


(s)
b b

a

where


(s)
a 


a (ih)1[  , y (s)

a

],


(s)
[
a ,


(s)

b

] = 0.

(c.4)

since the lie equations (3.1)-(3.2) may be written as

ha()|  

a (ih)1ya()! = 0, a()

(s)


(s)

a (ih)1[a(), ya()] = 0, (c.5)

where ya()  (ih)1[, a], it follows that we still have the quantum master equation
(4.4) but here with the -operator dened by

   + a(a  y (s)

a

)(1)a .

(c.6)

in this case we nd the general group element u (, ) = u (s)(, )u (, ). y (s)
is ex-
pressed in terms of u (s)(, ) and u (, ) is given by (6.3) in section 6. thus, the singlet
part of ya may be transformed away.
