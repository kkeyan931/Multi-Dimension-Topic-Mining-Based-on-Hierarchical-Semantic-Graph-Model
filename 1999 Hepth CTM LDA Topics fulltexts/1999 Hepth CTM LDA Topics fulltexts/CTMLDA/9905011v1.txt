abstract

calogero-moser models can be generalised for all of the nite reection groups.
these include models based on non-crystallographic root systems, that is the root sys-
tems of the nite reection groups, h3, h4, and the dihedral group i2(m), besides the
well-known ones based on crystallographic root systems, namely those associated with
lie algebras. universal lax pair operators for all of the generalised calogero-moser
models and for any choices of the potentials are constructed as linear combinations of
the reection operators. the consistency conditions are reduced to functional equa-
tions for the coecient functions of the reection operators in the lax pair. there are
only four types of such functional equations corresponding to the two-dimensional sub-
root systems, a2, b2, g2, and i2(m). the root type and the minimal type lax pairs,
derived in our previous papers, are given as the simplest representations. the spec-
tral parameter dependence plays an important role in the lax pair operators, which
bear a strong resemblance to the dunkl operators, a powerful tool for solving quantum
calogero-moser models.

1 introduction

generalised calogero-moser models are integrable many-particle dynamical systems based

on nite reection groups. finite reection groups include the dihedral groups i2(m) and h3

and h4 together with the weyl groups of the root systems associated with lie algebras, called

crystallographic root systems. integrability of classical calogero-moser models based on the

crystallographic root systems [1, 2] is shown in terms of lax pairs. the root and the minimal

type lax pairs derived in our previous papers [3] provide a universal framework for these

calogero-moser models, including those based on exceptional root systems and the twisted

models. on the other hand, a theory of classical integrability for the models based on non-

crystallographic root systems has been virtually non-existent. this is in sharp contrast with

the quantum counterpart. dunkl operators, which are useful for solving quantum calogero-

moser models, were rst explicitly constructed for the models based on the dihedral groups

[4].

in this paper we present a lax pair in an operator form for generalised calogero-moser

models, which applies universally to the models based on non-crystallographic root systems

as well as those based on crystallographic ones. this lax pair, as expected, bears a strong

resemblance to the dunkl operators [4, 5] and the reection operators play a central role.

the spectral parameter dependence is also essential, in contradistinction to the auxiliary

role in the conventional formalism [2]. when suitable representation spaces are chosen, the

universal lax pair reproduces the root type and the minimal type lax pairs for the models

based on the crystallographic root systems. this provides another clue that the quantum

and classical integrability of the generalised calogero-moser models are closely connected.

we hope that this lax pair operator formalism will cross-fertilise the fruitful subject of the

quantum and classical calogero-moser systems and related ones such as toda systems.

for the general background and the motivations of this paper and the physical appli-

cations of the calogero-moser models with various potentials to lower-dimensional physics,

ranging from solid state to particle physics and supersymmetric gauge theories, we refer to

our previous papers [3] and references therein.

this paper is organised as follows. in section 2 we summarise the basic concepts of the

nite reection groups in order to set the stage and to introduce appropriate notation. in

section 3 the generalised calogero-moser models are dened with various choices of root

systems and potentials. section 4 is the main body of the paper. the lax operators l and

2

m are dened as a linear combination of the reection operators s for all the roots . the

coecient functions depend on the dynamical variables and on the spectral parameter in a

rather symmetrical way. consistency of the lax pair can be proved quite easily. the lax

equation is at most quadratic in the reection operators, ss, which becomes an identity
operator for  = , s2
 = 1, and a two-dimensional rotation operator for  6= . the linear
(s1
) and the constant (s0
) parts give the canonical equations of motion of the generalised
calogero-moser models. the quadratic part ss,  6= , imposes the consistency conditions,
which are decomposed into those corresponding to two-dimensional sub-root systems con-

taining  and . as shown in table 1, there are only four types of two-dimensional root

systems, a2, b2, g2, and i2(5) for all of the coxeter groups except for the dihedral group

i2(m) which can have many for some values of m. thus the functions appearing in the lax

pair operator (except for those for i2(m)) need to satisfy at most two functional equations.

the solutions are derived in the appendix. in section 5 various possible representations of

the lax pair operator are discussed. the minimal type and the root type lax pairs are

derived as two simplest examples in section 6. various sum rules utilised in previous papers

are derived as restrictions of the general functional equations derived in section 4. some

comments and discussion are given in section 7. details of the derivation of the solutions are

relegated to the appendix. two types of solutions, the untwisted and twisted solutions, are

derived. the consistency conditions of all of the untwisted solutions are attributed to one

functional identity, (a.12), of the weierstrass  function. twisted solutions are obtained as

proper linear combinations of the untwisted ones.

2 root systems and nite reection groups

we now review some facts about root systems and their reection groups in order to introduce

notation [6]. we consider only reections in euclidean space. a root system  of rank r is
a set of vectors in rr which is invariant under reections in the hyperplane perpendicular

to each vector in . in other words,

in which

s()  ,

,   ,

s() =   2(  /||2).

3

(2.1)

(2.2)

dual roots are dened by  = 2/||2, in terms of which
s() =   ( ).

(2.3)

the orbit of    is the set of root vectors resulting from the action of the reections on it
{s(),   }. the set of positive roots + may be dened in terms of a vector v  rr,
with v   6= 0,   , as those roots    such that   v > 0. a unique set of r
simple roots  is dened such that they span the root space and the coecients {aj} in
 = pr
generated by products of s with    subject to the relations

the set of reections {s,   } generates a group, known as a coxeter group. it is

j=1 ajj for   +, {j  , j = 1, . . . , r} are all positive.

(ss)m(,) = 1,

,   .

(2.4)

the set of positive integers m(, ) uniquely specify the coxeter group with m(, ) =
1,   . for example, for two-dimensional crystallographic root systems a2, b2, and g2,
the integer m(, ) is 3, 4, and 6, respectively. thus ss is a two-dimensional rotation by
an angle 2/3, /2, and /3, respectively. this fact will be used in later sections. we
consider here only those coxeter groups with a nite number of roots in euclidean space,

called the nite reection groups.

the root systems for nite reection groups may be divided into two types: crystallo-

graphic and non-crystallographic root systems. crystallographic root systems satisfy the

additional condition

   z,

,   .

(2.5)

these root systems are associated with simple lie algebras: {ar, r  1}, {br, r  2},
{cr, r  2}, {dr, r  4}, e6, e7, e8, f4, and g2 and {bcr, r  2}. the coxeter groups
for these root systems are called weyl groups. the remaining non-crystallographic root
systems are h3, h4, and the dihedral group of order 2m, {i2(m), m  4}.

weyl chambers are dened as the open subsets of rr that result from removing the
reection hyperplanes h,   , h  {q  rr,  q = 0}. the action of the reection
group on the weyl chambers is transitive and free, i.e. any weyl chamber may be obtained

from another by the action of an element of the reection group and this element is unique.
the principal weyl chamber is dened as the one whose points q satisfy q   > 0,   +.
for crystallographic root systems this implies that all points in the principal weyl chamber

have positive dynkin labels.

4

denitions and properties of the crystallographic root systems may be found in many

references, see for example [7]. the concept of weights may be dened for these root systems.

for crystallographic root systems, any positive root is a sum of simple roots in  with

positive integer coecients. the set of weights , which lie on a lattice, is the set of
vectors such that if    then   is an integer for any   . fundamental weights
(j) are vectors which form a dual basis to the corresponding dual simple roots 
j , i.e.

j  (k) = jk, j, k = 1, . . . , r. any weight    may be expressed as a sum of fundamental
weights with integer coecients,  = pr
j=1 aj(j). the coecients {aj, j = 1, . . . , r} are

called the dynkin labels of .

we now briey describe the non-crystallographic root systems. the dihedral group of

order 2m, i2(m), is the group of orthogonal transformations that preserve a regular m-sided

polygon in two dimensions. it consists of m rotations (through multiples of 2/m) and m

reections. the angle between adjacent roots is /m and a possible basis for the roots, if all
are chosen to have the same length |j|2 = 1, is

j = (cos(j/m), sin(j/m)) ,

j = 1, . . . , 2m.

(2.6)

for odd m all of the roots are in the same orbit of the reection group but for even m there

are two orbits, one consisting of the j with odd j and the other with even j . this then

allows two dierent coupling constants and potential functions for the i2(m) calogero-moser

model for even m.

the reection group of type h4 is the symmetry group of a regular 120-side solid, with
dodecahedral faces, in r4. it is a group of order 14400. the group of type h3 is a subgroup
of h4 and is the symmetry group of the icosahedron (with 20 faces) in r3. it is a group of

order 120. dene

then a choice of simple roots for h4 is the following:

the full set of roots of h4 in this basis may be obtained from (1, 0, 0, 0), ( 1
(a, 1

2 ), and
2, b, 0) by even permutations and arbitrary sign changes of coordinates. these 120 roots

2 , 1

form a single orbit. a subset of (2.8), {1, 2, 3} is a choice of simple roots for the h3
root system. in this basis, the full set of roots for h3 results from even permutations and
arbitrary sign changes of (1, 0, 0) and (a, 1

2 , b). these 30 roots also form a single orbit.

3 generalised calogero-moser models

a generalised calogero-moser model is a hamiltonian system associated with a root system

 of rank r. quantum versions of these models are also integrable, at least for certain choices
of  and potential function [8]. the dynamical variables are the coordinates {qj} and their
canonically conjugate momenta {pj}, with the poisson brackets

{qj, pk} = j
k,

{qj, qk} = {pj, pk} = 0,

j, k = 1, . . . , r.

(3.1)

these will be denoted by vectors in rr

q = (q1, . . . , qr),

p = (p1, . . . , pr).

the hamiltonian for the calogero-moser model is

h =

1
2

p2 + x

g2
||

||2 v||(  q),

(3.2)

(3.3)

in which the real coupling constants g|| and potential functions v|| are dened on orbits of

the corresponding nite reection group, i.e. they are identical for roots in the same orbit.

this then ensures that the hamiltonian is invariant under reections of the phase space

variables about a hyperplane perpendicular to any root

q  s(q),

p  s(p),

  

(3.4)

with s dened by (2.3).

the lax pair operator that we will construct in later sections will apply for the following

potentials (g|| = g for all roots in simply laced models and g|| = gl for long roots and

g|| = gs for short roots in non-simply laced models):

1. untwisted elliptic potential . this applies to all of the crystallographic root systems

and the potential function is

v||(  q) = (  q|{21, 23}),

for all roots,

(3.5)

6

in which  is the weierstrass  function with a pair of primitive periods {21, 23}.
throughout this paper we adopt the convention that the weierstrass , , and 

functions have the above standard periods, unless otherwise stated.

2. twisted elliptic potential . this applies to all of the non-simply laced root systems.

except for the g2 model, the potential functions are

(  q|{21, 23}),
(  q|{1, 23}),

for long roots,

for short roots.

(3.6)

that is, the potential for short roots has one half of the standard period in one direction,

which we choose to be 1. for the g2 model,

v||(  q) = 


v||(  q) = 


(  q|{21, 23}),
(  q|{ 21
3 , 23}),

for long roots,

for short roots.

(3.7)

in this case the potential for short roots has one third of the standard period in one

direction, which we choose to be 1. the cases of bcr system and the extended br,

cr, and bcr systems will be discussed separately in later sections.

3. trigonometric and hyperbolic potentials. this applies to all crystallographic systems

and the potential functions are

v||(  q) = 


a2/sin2 a(  q),
a2/sinh2 a(  q),

for all roots,

(3.8)

in which a is an arbitrary real constant.

4. rational potential . this applies to all of the generalised calogero-moser models includ-

ing those based on the dihedral group i2(m), h3, and h4 and the potential function

is

v||(  q) =

1

(  q)2 ,

these models are also integrable if a conning harmonic potential

for all roots.

(3.9)

is added to the hamiltonian.

2

2q2

7

(3.10)

some remarks are in order. (i) for all of the root systems and for any choice of the
potential, the generalised calogero-moser model has a hard repulsive potential  1
near the reection hyperplane h = {q  rr,  q = 0}. this repulsion potential is
classically insurmountable. thus the motion is always conned within one weyl chamber.

(q)2

in other words, the spatial ordering of the particles is unchanged during the time evolution.

this simplifying feature is a basic cornerstone of the solvability. the coupling constants
g2
|| (with a scale 1/||2) are measures of the strength of the repulsive potentials. (ii) the
trigonometric, hyperbolic, and the rational potentials are obtained from the elliptic potential

as one or both periods tend to innity. the lax pairs for these degenerate potentials can

be obtained from the one for the elliptic potential by taking the corresponding limit. thus

we do not write down the lax pairs for degenerate potential cases except for the models

based on the non-crystallographic root systems, for which only the rational potentials are

integrable. (iii) for all of the lax pairs based on any root systems and any choice of the

potential, except for the rational potential with the harmonic conning potential (3.10), one

can introduce an additional complex parameter  (spectral parameter ), which appears in
the equation for the spectral curve [9, 10]. (iv) independent conserved quantities t r(lk)
to be obtained from a lax equation l = [l, m] occur at such k = 1 + exponent of the

corresponding crystallographic root systems. for the non-crystallographic root systems,

they arise at k = 2, m for the dihedral group i2(m), k = 2, 6, 10 for h3 and k = 2, 12, 20, 30

for h4. these are the degrees at which coxeter invariant polynomials exist [6].

4 lax pair and functional equations

here we construct a lax pair for the generalised calogero-moser models in an operator

form acting on an as yet unspecied vector space and derive the necessary and sucient

conditions for the consistency of the lax equations. the lax pair (4.5) contains operators

as well as functions x||(u, w), y||(u, w), which are related to the chosen potential (3.5)(3.9).

the consistency of the lax pair requires that x||(u, w) satisfy certain functional equations

(4.27), (a.7), which are closely related with those required for the commutativity of dunkl

operators [4, 5]. verication that the solutions (4.34), (4.37), (4.38), (4.41), (4.44), (4.45)

satisfy the functional equations will be presented in the appendix.

the operators appearing in the lax pair for a generalised calogero-moser model asso-
ciated with a root system  are naturally the reection operators {s,   } of the root

8

system. they act on a set of rr vectors  = {(k)  rr, k = 1, . . .}, which is closed under
the action of the reection group. the totality of the vectors in  forms the representation

space v. a general construction of the representation space, and some explicit cases will
be presented in the subsequent two sections. another set of operators { hj, j = 1, . . . , r} is
necessary. if hj acts on a vector (k)  , the j-th component is returned:

hj(k) = (k)

j (k).

these form the following operator algebra:

[ hj, hk] = 0,
[ hj, s] = j( h)s,
ss s = ss(),

(ss)m(,) = 1.

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

the rst relation (4.1) implies that the operators { hj, j = 1, . . . , r} form an abelian sub-
algebra and relations (4.3) and (4.4) are just those for the nite reection group associated

with the root system . the set of integers m(, ) are those appearing in the coxeter

relations (2.4) which characterise the reection group.

next we describe the lax pair and the corresponding hamiltonian for the generalised

calogero-moser model for the root system . the lax operators are

g|| ( h) x||(  q, ( h)) s,

(4.5)

l = p  h + x,
m = i x+

x = i x+

g|| y||(  q, ( h)) s.

the function y|| is dened by

y||(u, w) 


u

x||(u, w).

(4.6)

the variable u takes care of the dynamical variable dependence and w is for the spectral

parameter dependence. furthermore, it is required that x||(u, w) is odd:

x||(u,w) = x||(u, w)

(4.7)

so that l and m are independent of the choice of positive roots +. this also implies that

the sums in (4.5) may be extended to a sum over all roots if an additional factor of 1/2 is

9

included in front of the sums since the summands are even under   . the function
x||(u, w) is assumed to have a simple pole at u = 0 with unit residue

lim
u0

u x||(u, w) = 1.

(4.8)

this condition is related with the unit strength of the repulsive potential near the reection

hyperplane mentioned earlier.

before proving the consistency of this lax pair we calculate the hamiltonian and nd

the corresponding equations of motion. the hamiltonian for the theory is dened in terms

of a representation of the operator l of (4.5) by

h =

1

2cr

t r(l2)

where the constant cr, which depends on the representation, is dened by

the resulting hamiltonian is then

t r( hj hk) = cr jk.

h =

2

p2 + x

g2
||

||2 v||(  q) + c,

(4.9)

(4.10)

(4.11)

in which c is independent of the dynamical variables q and p and therefore unimportant for

the classical theory. the potential functions are given in (3.5)(3.9). the function x|| and

the potential function v|| are related (except for the conning harmonic potential (3.10),

which has to be added separately) simply as

x||(u, w)x||(u, w) = v||(u) + c||(w),

(4.12)

i.e. the product gives a sum of a function of only u and a function of only w. it is easy

to show that all of the functions x||(u, w) which lead to a consistent lax equation, (4.34),

(4.37), (4.38), (4.41), (4.44), (4.45), satisfy this property.

the equations of motion following from this hamiltonian are

(4.13)

(4.14)

10

because of (4.12) the last expression in (4.14) is independent of w.

the lax equation

l = [l, m]

may be divided into three parts as

d
dt

x = [p  h, m],

d

(p  h) = [x, m]diagonal,

0 = [x, m]o-diagonal.

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

we next prove, in turn, that each of these equations is consistent with the equations of

motion (4.13).

the left-hand side of (4.16) is

d

x = i x+

g|| ( h) y||(  q, ( h)) (  q) s

(4.19)

and the right-hand side is

[p  h, m] = hp  h, i x+

g|| y||(  q, ( h)) [p  h, s],
g|| y||(  q, ( h)) ( h) (  p) s,

(4.20)

the third line follows from the commutation relation (4.2) and the last line follows from the

equation of motion q = p.

the left-hand side of (4.17), after using the equations of motion (4.13) is

g2
||

d
dt

(p  h) = x

||2 (  h)hy||(  q, w)x||(  q, w)  x||(  q, w)y||(  q, w)i . (4.21)
the summand x||(u, w)y||(u, w) x||(u, w)y||(u, w) is independent of the parameter w.
the commutator [l, m] reads

[x, m] = h x+
=  x,+

g|| ( h) x||(  q, ( h)) s, x+
g||g||h( h) x||(  q, ( h)) y||(  q, (s() h))ss
y||(  q, ( h)) (s() h) x||(  q, (s() h)) ssi.(4.22)

g|| y||(  q, ( h))si,

11

since ss and s s are rotations (except for  = , s2

 = 1) they do not leave any real vectors
in the rotation plane invariant. thus [x, m] is decomposed into the diagonal ( = ) and
the o-diagonal ( 6= ) parts. the diagonal part gives the equation of motion
||( h)hy||(  q, ( h)) x||(  q, ( h))
x||(  q, ( h)) y||(  q, ( h))i,

[x, m]diag. = x+

finally, (4.18) will lead to the functional equations which must be satised by the func-

tions x||(u, w) in the lax pair. relabeling the roots in the second summation of (4.22) gives

the general operator form for the functional equation

0 = [x, m]o-diag.

g||g||h( h)x||(  q, ( h))y||(  q, (s() h))

(s() h)y||(  q, ( h))x||(  q, (s() h))iss. (4.25)

this shows that the consistency condition involving all of the roots is decomposed into
a sum of two-dimensional ones corresponding to a xed rotation r  ss in each two-
dimensional plane. since the coecient of r  ss in this equation must separately
vanish, this may be decomposed into the functional equations

0 =

x6=+, r=ss

g||g||h( )x||(  q, ( ))y||(  q, (s() ))
(s() )y||(  q, ( )) x||(  q, (s() ))i, (4.26)

in which  is a generic vector in . this equation must be satised for a xed rotation

r = ss and all roots appearing in it are in the two-dimensional sub-root system  =
{,   (span(, )} with positive roots +  +. the only possible two-dimensional
root systems  are a1  a1, a2, b2, g2, and i2(m). table 1 shows the two-dimensional
sub-root systems appearing in the root systems of nite reection groups. the a1  a1 root
system has been omitted since its corresponding functional equation is trivially satised for

any function and therefore does not give any constraint on the functions x||(u, w). it should

be stressed that the functional equations are determined by the two-dimensional sub-root

systems only and not by where they are embedded in the entire root system. thus, as seen

since the coupling constants g|| are arbitrary and are constants on the orbits they may be
rescaled as g||  2g||/|| for all   . performing this rescaling of the coupling constants

13

and using the action of r/2 in (4.29), the previous equation becomes

this is the same as the earlier form of the functional equation in (4.26), after using the
denition  = 2/||2.

we next present the functional equations for the two-dimensional root systems, a2, b2,

g2, and i2(m), and state their solutions. the proofs that the solutions satisfy the relevant

functional equations are contained in the appendix.

we rst consider the functional equation for the a2 root system with simple roots  and

. we choose r2/3 = ss and the functional equation (4.25) becomes

0 =   r/3


q

fa2(q, )

in which fa2(q, ) is dened by

fa2(q, ) =

x(( + )  q, ( + ) ) x(  q, )

+ x(  q,  ) x(( + )  q,  )
 x(  q,  ) x(  q, ( + ) ).

(4.32)

(4.33)

the subscripts on the function x is omitted since all roots are in the same orbit and hence

only one function appears. also the spectral parameter  is absorbed into  by redenition:
  /. we look for solutions to this functional equation, as well as the ones for other
root systems, which are valid for arbitrary vectors q and . therefore these solutions are

valid in any representations. in certain representations, such as the minimal and the root

type representations discussed in section 6, there is a larger class of solutions. the functional

equation arising from the rotation r2/3 is equivalent to that given above. a simple solution

to (4.32) satisfying the residue condition (4.8) is

x(u, w) =

(w  u)
(w)(u)

exp[b w u],

(4.34)

in which b is an arbitrary complex parameter. the potential function in the resulting hamil-

tonian (3.3), v (u) = (u), is the weierstrass elliptic function with the set of primitive

14

periods 21 and 23. the limits as one or both periods diverge yield the potential functions
a2/ sin2(au) and a2/ sinh2(au) or 1/u2, respectively [3].

functional equation (4.26) for the b2 root system may be written in terms of the short

and long simple roots,  and , respectively. we choose r/2 = ss in (4.25) and the

resulting functional equation is

0 =   r/4


q

fb2(q, )

in which

fb2(q, ) =  xs(  q,  ) xl(  q, (2 + ) )

+ xs(( + )  q, ( + ) ) xl((2 + )  q, )
+ xs(  q,( + ) ) xl((2 + )  q, (2 + ) )
+ xs(( + )  q,  ) xl(  q,  ).

(4.35)

(4.36)

in this case there are two sets of elliptic function solutions for the long and short root

functions, xl and xs, respectively. the solutions along with the corresponding potential

functions are

xl(u, w) = xs(u, w) =

(w  u)
(w)(u)

exp[b w u],

vl(u) = vs(u) = (u),

for the untwisted solution and

xl(u, w) =

xs(u, w) =

=

(w  u)
(w)(u)

exp[b w u],

(w/2  u|{1, 23})

(w/2|{1, 23})(u|{1, 23})
xl(u, w/2)xl(u + 1, w/2)

xl(1, w/2)

,

exp[(b +

e1
2

) w u],

(4.37)

(4.38)

vl(u) = (u),

vs(u) = (u|{1, 23}),

for the twisted solution. here e1  (1) and b is an arbitrary complex constant.

next we consider the functional equation (4.26) for the g2 root system with short and

long simple roots  and , respectively. we choose r/3 = ss in (4.26) and the functional

equation is

0 =   r/6


q

fg2(q, ),

15

(4.39)

in which

fg2(q, ) =  xs(  q,  ) xl(  q, (3 + ) )

+ xs(  q,(2 + ) ) xl((3 + )  q, (3 + ) )
+ xs((2 + )  q, (2 + ) ) xl((3 + )  q,(3 + 2) )
+ xs((2 + )  q,( + ) ) xl((3 + 2)  q, (3 + 2) )
+ xs(( + )  q, ( + ) ) xl((3 + 2)  q, )
+ xs(( + )  q,  ) xl(  q,  ).

(4.40)

as before, xs and xl are the functions for short and long roots, respectively. the elliptic

function solutions to (4.39) along with the corresponding potential functions vs(u) and vl(u)

are the untwisted ones in (4.37) and the following twisted ones

xl(u, w) =

xs(u, w) =

=

(w  u)
(w)(u)

exp[b w u],

(w/3  u|{21/3, 23})

(w/3|{21/3, 23})(u|{21/3, 23})

exp[(b +

vl(u) = (u),

vs(u) = (u|{21/3, 23}).

(21/3)) w u],

exp[b w u],

(4.41)

here again, b is an arbitrary complex parameter. the short and long root functions also

satisfy the a2 functional equation (4.32) separately, as expected.

finally, we consider the functional equation (4.26) for the i2(m) root system. the 2m
roots are labelled in order of increasing angle by {1, . . . , 2m} with + = {j, j = 1, . . . , m}
and j+m = j for j = 1, . . . , m. for example, choosing all roots to have the same length
|j| = 1, a possible basis is given in (2.6). unlike the crystallographic root systems, there is,
in general, more than one functional equation. the functional equation (4.26) corresponding

to r = ss with  = 2n/m, n = 1, . . . , [m/2] is

0 =   rn /m


q

f n
i2(m)(q, )

with

xj=1

g|j| g|j+n | x|j+n |(j+n  q, 

j+n ) x|j|(j  q,

j+2n ).

(4.42)

(4.43)

in contrast to the previous cases, the the coupling constants are included in the functional

equation since they do not factor out, in general. because of the many functional equations

16

(4.42) to be satised, only rational solutions are allowed in this case. for odd m, i2(m)

roots are all in a single orbit and only one coupling constant and function are possible. the

solution to (4.42) in this case is

x(u, w) = (cid:18) 1
u 

1

w(cid:19) exp[b u w].

(4.44)

however, i2(m) for even m has two orbits: one the set {j} with odd j and the other with
even j. it is possible to have two independent coupling constants and functions in this case.

the corresponding functions are denoted xo and xe, respectively and the solution of (4.42)

is

xo(u, w) = (cid:18) 1
u 
xe(u, w) = (cid:18) 1
u 

1

w(cid:19) exp[b u w],
w(cid:19) exp[b u w],

c

(4.45)

in which b and c are arbitrary complex constants.

for the other non-crystallographic root systems h3 and h4, the two-dimensional sub-root

systems are a2 and i2(5). thus the solution (4.44) satises all of the functional equations

for the consistency of the lax pair.

at the end of this section, let us show the lax pair operator formulation for the rational

potential with a conning harmonic force. this applies, as before, to all of the root systems

including the non-crystallographic ones. this is a simple generalisation of the lax pairs given

in [2], which were constructed for the vector representations of the classical root systems,

ar, br, cr, dr, and bcr.

let us start from the lax operator for the rational potential without spectral parameter:

g|| ( h) x(  q) s,

g|| y(  q) s,

l = p  h + i x+
m = i x+
x(  q) =

  q

y(  q) =

(  q)2 = x(  q)2.

it corresponds to the following hamiltonian and the equations of motion:

the equations of motion read

(  q)3 .

it is elementary to see that the above equations can be written in an operator form

q = p  h = l  x,
in which l and m are the same as before (4.46) and q is dened by

l = [l, m]  2q,

it is easy to verify that

q = q  h.

[q, m] = x.

this property is valid only for the rational potential without spectral parameter.

next let us introduce a pair of non-hermitian operators l by

their time evolution equations read

l = l  iq.

l = l  i q

= [l, m]  2q  i(l  x)
= [l  iq, m]  2q  i(l  x)
= [l, m]  2q  i(l  iq)
= [l, m]  il.

if we dene hermitian operators l1 and l2

they satisfy lax-like equations

l1 = l+l, l2 = ll+,

lj = [lj, m],

j = 1, 2.

j = 1, 2,

k = 1, 2, . . . ,

(4.59)

as before. it is elementary to check that the rst conserved quantities give the hamiltonian

(4.50)

this then completes the derivation of the lax pairs for all of the generalised calogero-moser

t r(lj)  h,

j = 1, 2.

(4.60)

models.

5 representations of the lax operators

we next consider representations of the operator algebra (4.1-4.4) for operators { hj, j =
in general,
1, . . . r} and {s,   } that appear in the calogero-moser lax pair (4.5).
the representation of an algebra consists of a vector space v and a mapping from elements
of the algebra to gl(v), e.g. s  r(s). when a basis is chosen for v then r(s)
becomes a matrix in gl(d) where d is the dimension of v. first dene a monomial p(t) =
qn
j=1(v(j)  t) in an auxiliary vector variable t  rr associated with a set  of vectors
{v(j)  rr, j = 1, . . . n}. the basis vectors of v, for a representation r of the algebra
(4.1-4.4), are monomials resulting from the orbit of p(t) under the reection group, i.e.
p(s(t)) with   1. all of the monomials in v therefore have the same degree n. a
similar representation for only the reection generators s with  a sub-root system of 

was introduced by macdonald for irreducible representations of the weyl groups [11, 12].

the action of the operators on the basis vectors in v, is

(v(j)  t).
yj=1

(5.1)

note that the representation matrices {r( hl), l = 1, . . . , r} are all diagonal in this basis.

all of the previous versions of lax pairs for the calogero-moser models, namely the
minimal and root type lax pairs, result from (4.5) in a representation r with  a single
1more generally, the vector space for the representation is sym(w ), the symmetric algebra on the

r-dimensional dual vector space w .

19

vector, i.e. (5.1) with n = 1 [3]. in the case of n = 1, the vectors in v, upon which the
representation matrices act, may be denoted in a simple manner as |i with

|i  (  t).

(5.2)

for the minimal type lax pair, the representation has |i  v with  being a weight in the
same weyl orbit as the highest weight of a minimal representation of the corresponding lie

algebra. for the root type lax pair, the vectors  in v are labelled by all of the roots for

the simply-laced root systems and either the short or long roots for the non-simply laced

root systems. all of the  which label the basis vectors of v are then in a single weyl orbit,

as required. it will be demonstrated in section 6 that the lax pairs in these representations

agree with those given in [3].

there is a simple relation between the geometry of the root system and the dimension
of the r representations for  a single vector. the vectors  labelling the |i  v are
generated by the orbit of a single vector 0 under the action of the nite reection group. the

vector 0 may also be assumed, without loss of generality, to be in the principal weyl chamber

or its boundary. the dimension of the representation depends only on which reection
hyperplanes, if any, contain the vector 0. let 0 be the set of indices j such that 0 
{j, 0  j = 0, j  }. for crystallographic root systems 0 are the dynkin labels of
0 which are equal to zero. then sj (0) = 0 for j  0 or the isotropy group i0 of
0 is generated by reections about simple roots j   for which j  0. therefore
the number of elements in the orbit of 0 under the reection group w , and hence the
dimension of the representation, is d = |w|/|i0|. since the isotropy group is the direct
product of the reection groups corresponding to the connected parts of the coxeter diagram

for the original root system, after deleting those vertices corresponding to the indices j not
contained in i0, |i0| may be computed as the product of the orders of the reection groups
of the corresponding coxeter sub-diagrams.

as a rst example, we calculate the dimensions of the minimal and root type repre-

sentations of the algebra in (4.1-4.4) and hence the lax pairs for a5. there are three
inequivalent minimal representations with 0 = (1), (2), or (3). for 0 = (1), the vec-
tor representation, the isotropy group i0 = wa4 so d = |wa5|/|wa4| = 6!/5! = 6. for
the antisymmetric product of two vector representations, 0 = (2), i0 = wa1  wa3 so
we obtain d = 6!/(2!4!) = 15. the antisymmetric product of three vector representa-
tions, 0 = (3), i0 = wa2  wa2 so we obtain d = 6!/(3!3!) = 40. finally, for the root

20

representation, choose 0 = (1) + (5), which is the highest root. then i0 = wa3 and
d = |wa5|/|wa3| = 6!/4! = 30. as an aside, we note that the highest dimensional repre-
sentation of the lax pair for a5 has 0 = a1(1) + a2(2) + a3(3) + a4(4) + a5(5) with

all non-vanishing coecients aj, j = 1, . . . , 5. since the dimension of the representation de-

pends only on which dynkin labels are non-zero, these coecients aj may be chosen to be

1, without loss of generality. then the isotropy group is trivial and we obtain d = 6!, which

has not been previously described. in fact, even among the representations r with n = 1,

most of the matrices for the lax pairs had not been described before.

as a second example, let us evaluate the dimensions of some lower-dimensional lax pairs
for the e8 model. let us take 0 = (1) and 0 = (7) corresponding to the two end points of
the two longer forks of the e8 dynkin diagram. for 0 = (1) the isotropy group i0 = we7
and d = |we8|/|we7| = 240. this gives the root type lax pair. for 0 = (7) the isotropy
group i0 = wd7 and d = |we8|/|wd7| = 2160. this gives the second smallest lax pair for
the e8 model and its weights are a part of the 3875 representation.

for the non-crystallographic root systems, the root type lax pairs with dimensions 2m

for i2(m), 30 for h3 and 120 for h4 give the smallest dimensional lax pair matrices.

6 minimal and root type lax pairs

as examples of representations of the lax operators, we consider those representations that

yield the minimal and root type lax pairs previously reported in ref.

[3]. the functional

equations associated with these representations are also derived by restricting those given

in section 4. these are the same as those given in our previous papers, which we denote as

sum rules. in this section we consider only the crystallographic root systems.

minimal type lax pairs are associated with minimal representations of the lie algebras.

all of the fundamental representations of ar, the spinor representation of br, the vector

representation of cr, and the vector, spinor and anti-spinor representations of dr, the 27

and 27 of e6 and the 56 of e7 are the minimal representations. all weights in a minimal
representation are in a single weyl orbit. the vectors |i  v of the representation are
{|i,   min}, in which min is the set of weights of the minimal representation. they
are characterised by the condition

  = {0,1},

  ,   min.

(6.1)

21

on the other hand the vectors |i  v of the root type lax pairs are {|i,   }
for a simply-laced root system . the set of basis vectors of the two possible root type
representations for a lax pair associated with a non-simply laced root system are {|i,  
s}, the set of short roots, and {|i,   l}, the set of long roots. let us collectively
denote by r the set of basis vectors of various root type representations:

,
l,
s,

for simply laced models,
for non-simply laced models, long roots,
for non-simply laced models, short roots.

all roots,

r = 


the roots are characterised by the condition

  = {0, 1, 2},

,   ,

(6.2)

except for the g2 case in which 3 are also possible.

the fact that the eigenvalues of the operator  h are restricted to these values (6.1),
(6.2) simplies the representation of the lax pair operator (4.5) drastically. especially at
the zero eigenvalue of  h the functions x|| and y|| take the following simple forms:

lim
w0

w x||(u, w) = 


1/,
2/,
3/,

untwisted,
twisted short roots,
twisted short roots, g2,

lim
w0

y||(u, w) = v||(u) + d||,

(6.3)

(6.4)

in which d|| are constants possibly depending on the orbits, that is, dl and ds for the

non-simply laced cases.

with the basis vectors of v, upon which the representation matrices act, labelled by a

single vector, as in (5.2), the matrix elements of the minimal and root type lax pairs are

l|i = xmin
l|i = xr

r(l)|i,
r(l)|i,

m|i = xmin
m|i = xr

r(m)|i,
r(m)|i,

,   min,
,   r,

(6.5)

(6.6)

where l and m are the lax operators dened in (4.5). hereafter we adopt simplied notation
l (l) and m (m) for the matrix elements r(l) (r(l) ) and r(m) (r(m)
). for an arbitrary function f (u) we have the following matrix element for the minimal type

f ( h)s|i = xmin(cid:26)f (1), + f (0),,0 + f (1),(cid:27)|i,

(6.7)

22

and for the root type (except for the g2 case)

f ( h)s|i = xr(cid:26)f (2),2 + f (1), + f (0),,0

+f (1), + f (2),2(cid:27)|i.

(6.8)

the g2 case can be handled in a similar way.

by combining (6.3), (6.4) and (6.7), (6.8) it is straightforward to derive the matrix

representations of the minimal and root type lax pairs. for the minimal lax pair we obtain

l = p   , + i x
m = i

 x, =1

g||v||(  q)


g||x||(  q, ), + am,,

(6.9)

, + i x

g||y||(  q, ), + bm,,

(6.10)

in which am is a constant and bm contains the dynamical variables q. both have no eect

on the lax equation and can thus be omitted. they are

am =

bm =

in which n m
s ) is the number of long (short) roots    such that    = 0 for a
given   min. the integer n m
s ) is well-dened since all vectors labelling the basis
elements in v for the representation are in a single weyl orbit and hence any other vector,
say  = w() for w an element of the weyl group. this implies that    = 0 if and only
if w()   = 0 and so n m
l is the same for any choice of   min. when the am and bm
terms are dropped, the above lax pair (6.9), (6.10) has the same form as that given in our

previous paper [3].

for the root type lax pair we obtain

l = p   , + i x
m = i

g||hx||(  q, ), + 2 x||(  q, 2),2i + ar,,(6.11)

g||v||(  q) + x=,

g||v||(  q)

(6.12)

as in the minimal case ar is a constant and br contains the dynamical variables q. both

have no eect on the lax equation and can be omitted. they are

ar =

(gln r

in which n r

given   , (l, s). when the ar and br terms are dropped and with the following
identication:

xl(u, )  x(u, ),
xl(u, 2)  xd(u, ),

xs(u, )  x(u, )
xs(u, 2)  xd(u, ) or x(1/2)

d

or x(1/2)(u, ),

(u, ),

(6.13)

the above lax pair (6.11), (6.13) has the same form as that given in our previous paper [3].

the restrictions on the eigenvalues of the operator (6.1), (6.2), simplify the functional

equations, too. let us examine the a2 functional equation (4.32) by adopting the variables
u, v, 1, and 2 dened in (a.8). we impose a condition 1 =  = 2, so that the restriction
of the minimal representation (6.1) is satised. the limit formulas (6.3) and (6.4) yield the

so called rst sum rule of ref. [3]

x(u, ) y(v, )  y(u, ) x(v, ) + x(u + v, )[v (v)  v (u)] = 0.

(6.14)

here the sux || is omitted since all the roots participating in the a2 functional equation
belong to the same orbit. likewise, let us impose a condition 1 = 2, 2 = , so that the
restriction of the root type representation (6.2) is satised. the limit formulas (6.3) and

(6.4) yield the so called second sum rule of ref. [3]

0 = x(u + v, )y(u, )  y(u + v, )x(u, )

+2 [x(u, 2)y(v, )  y(v, )x(u + v, 2)]
+x(v, )y(u + v, 2)  y(u, 2)x(v, ).

(6.15)

one may also verify that all of the functional equations in [3] which must be satised

by the functions x||(u, w) appear as various restrictions of the operator equation in (4.27),

although we will not derive them here. since the functional equations for the minimal and

root type representations are restricted, their solution spaces are larger than that for a

24

generic representation. for example, these functional equations have the same solutions as

the general solutions given in section 4, except that the exponential factor is changed from

exp[b w u] to exp[b(w) u], in which an arbitrary function b(w) need not be linear in w.

7 comments and discussion

firstly, let us comment on the relation between our work and the paper on elliptic dunkl op-

erators by buchstaber, felder, and veselov [5]. from the commutativity of dunkl operators

they derived a functional equation eq. (9) of ref. [5], which was closely related to our equa-

tions fa2 = 0, fb2 = 0, fg2 = 0. but their equation did not contain the spectral parameter

dependence explicitly. they obtained what would amount to our untwisted solution for the

fa2 = 0 functional equation. this gives a clue that the classical and quantum integrability

of the generalised calogero-moser models are closely connected. secondly, some remarks

about the calogero-moser models based on br, cr, and bcr root systems. the short roots

of br, the long roots of cr, and the long and short roots of bcr, when restricted to any
two-dimensional plane, form only an a1  a1 sub-root system. this means that their short
root function xs(u, w) (and/or xl(u, w)) in these models are required to satisfy the b2 func-

tional equation only but not the a2 one. thus the solution space is larger than that of the

other models. this in turn allows more potential function terms (one more for br, and cr

and two more for bcr) with independent coupling constant(s) in the hamiltonian without

breaking integrability. we call these models extended twisted models. the root type and

minimal type lax pairs for the extended models are given in [3, 13]. the lax pair operators

for the extended twisted models can be constructed in a similar way as is given in this paper.
thirdly, a few words about the structure of the functions x||(  q, ( )) and their func-
tional equations (4.26), (4.27), and the self-duality of the two-dimensional crystallographic
root systems. the coecients in the functional equation (4.26), i.e.   and s() , etc.,
come from the second argument of the function x||( q, ( )). namely, they are co-roots.
on the other hand, the gradient operator, /q, in (4.27) supplies the coecient from the
rst argument of the function x||(  q, ( )), that is the roots. the operator r/4 in
the b2 case and r/6 in the g2 case rotates a short root into a long root position and vice

versa. in other words, the rotation operator r/2 in (4.27) performs the necessary conversion

from the roots to the co-roots. this is possible because of the well-known self-duality of the
two-dimensional crystallographic root systems, a2, b2, and g2, under    = 2/2.

25

as a nal remark, let us comment on the integrability of the generalised calogero-moser

models. as is well known, the existence of the independent involutive conserved quantities

as many as the degrees of freedom is necessary and sucient for the liouville integrability.

to the best of our knowledge, the involution of the conserved quantities for the models based

on the exceptional root systems and the non-crystallographic root systems as well as all the

twisted models is yet to be demonstrated.

a appendix: solutions to functional equations

in this appendix we demonstrate that the solutions (4.34), (4.37), (4.38), (4.41), (4.44),

(4.45) given in section 4 satisfy the functional equations for the consistency of the lax pair

0 =   r/2


q

f (q, ).

(a.1)

we do not give a proof that these solutions are the most general ones. first let us remark

on a symmetry of the solutions of (a.1) such that if x||(u, w) is a solution then

xnew
|| (u, w)  x||(u, w) exp[b u w],

b  c,

(a.2)

is also a solution. therefore, it is necessary to prove (a.7) only for one representative function

x||(u, w) among those related by the symmetry (a.2). assume that the function x||(u, w)

satises (a.1) with f (q, ) dened by (4.28). the corresponding expression in (4.28) for the
new solution xnew

f (q, )new =

|| (u, w)  x||(u, w) exp[b u w] will be denoted as f (q, )new. then
g|| g||(cid:26)x||(  q, ( )) x||(  q, (s() ))
 exp [b  ((  q)( ) + (  q)(s() ))](cid:27). (a.3)

x6=+, r=ss

26

the exponent is proportional to

q    q  s (s())  q    q  r.

two pairs of roots (, ) and (, ) which appear in dierent terms of (a.3) are related by

ss = ss, which implies also

ss = ss = r.

(a.4)

therefore the exponential factor in (a.3) is common to all terms and may be factored out
of the sum. the functional equation (a.1) for f (q, )new then is

f (q, )new

(a.5)

  r/2


q

q

(f (q, ) exp [b(q    q  r)])

=   r/2
= bf (q, ) exp [b(q    q  r)](cid:16)  r/2    r/2(cid:17)

= 0.

here the orthogonality of rotation operators

  r/2    r/2 = 0, r/2 = rt

/2

(a.6)

is used. this then demonstrates that the transformed function x||(u, w)new satises the

functional equation if the original function x||(u, w) does.

next we show in turn that all of the solutions given in section 4 satisfy

fg(q, ) = 0,

g = a2, b2, g2,

(a.7)

which is a sucient condition for the solutions of (a.1). note that this is a necessary and

sucient condition for the commutativity of the corresponding dunkl operators [5].

a.1 a2 solution (4.34)

dening the variables

u =   q,
1 =  ,

v =   q,
2 =  ,

(a.8)

fa2(q, ) becomes

fa2(q, ) = x(u + v, 1 + 2) x(u,2) + x(v, 2) x(u + v, 1)  x(u, 1) x(v, 1 + 2).

(a.9)

27

by substituting the solution

x(u, w) =

(w  u)
(w)(u)

it reads, after extracting a common denominator,

fa2(u, v, 1, 2) = [(1 + 2  u  v) (2 + u) (v) (1)
+(2  v) (1  u  v) (u) (1 + 2)
(1  u) (1 + 2  v) (u + v) (2)]
/ [(u) (v) (u + v) (1)(2) (1 + 2)] .

(a.10)

(a.11)

the expression in the numerator may be shown to vanish, by using the following identity

(see page 153 of [14] and eq. (5.1) of [15])

0 = (z  u1) (z + u1) (u2  u3) (u2 + u3)
+(z  u2) (z + u2) (u3  u1) (u3 + u1)
+(z  u3) (z + u3) (u1  u2) (u1 + u2)

with the choice of variables

z = 2 +

1
2

(1  v),

u2 =

1
2

(1 + v),

1
2

(1  v),

u1 = u 
u3 =

1
2

(1  v).

(a.12)

(a.13)

this implies that fa2(q, ) = 0 for the function in (a.10) and after including the symmetry

of solutions (a.2), the more general function in (4.34) also gives fa2(q, ) = 0 and therefore

the a2 functional equation is satised.

a.2 b2 untwisted solution (4.37)

next we turn to the functional equation arising from the b2 sub-root system. this, as well

as the functional equation associated with the g2 root system, admits two types of solutions,

the untwisted and the twisted ones. by using the same denitions of the variables u, v, 1,

and 2 as in (a.8), except for the fact that  and  are the short and long simple roots of

b2, respectively, the expression for fb2(q, ) becomes

fb2(u, v, 1, 2) =  xs(u, 1) xl(v, 1 + 2)

(a.14)

+ xs(u + v, 1 + 22) xl(2u + v,2)
+ xs(u,1  22) xl(2u + v, 1 + 2)
+ xs(u + v, 1) xl(v, 2).

28

substituting in the untwisted solutions

xl(u, w) = xs(u, w) =

(w  u)
(w)(u)

(a.15)

this becomes

fb2(u, v, 1, 2) = [(1  u) (1 + 2  v) (u + v) (2u + v) (2) (1 + 22)
+(1 + 22  u  v) (2 + 2u + v) (u) (v) (1) (1 + 2)
+(1 + 22 + u) (1 + 2  2u  v) (v) (u + v) (1) (2)
+(1  u  v) (2  v) (u) (2u + v) (1 + 2) (1 + 22)]
/ [(u) (v)(2u + v) (1) (2) (1 + 2) (1 + 22)] .

(a.16)

let us denote the numerator by gb2(u, v, 1, 2). gathering terms, one obtains

gb2(u, v, 1, 2) = (2u + v) (1 + 22)[(1  u) (1 + 2  v) (u + v) (2)

+(1  u  v) (2  v) (u) (1 + 2)]
+(v) (1)[(1 + 22  u  v) (2 + 2u + v) (u) (1 + 2)
+(1 + 22 + u) (1 + 2  2u  v) (u + v) (2)].

(a.17)

using the identity (a.12) for the expression in the rst set of brackets with the choice of

variables

z = v +
u2 =

1
2

1
2

(u + 1 + 2),

(u + 1 + 2),

u1 =

u3 =

1
2
1
2

(u  1 + 2),
(u + 1 + 2),

and for the expression in the second set of brackets with the variables

z =

u2 =

1
2
1
2

(u + 1 + 32),

u1 =

(u + 1 + 2),

u3 =

1
(3u + 2v  1  2),
2
1
(u + 1 + 2),
2

gives

(a.18)

(a.19)

gb2(u, v, 1, 2) = (2u + v) (1 + 22) (v) (1 + 2  u  v) (1) (2 + u)
+(v) (1) (2 + u) (1 + 22) (1 + 2  u  v) (2u + v)

= 0.

(a.20)

29

including the possible symmetry transformations (a.2) of the function (a.15) this then

proves that fb2(q, ) = 0 for the general elliptic untwisted solution of (4.37).

the untwisted solution (4.37) of the g2 functional equation (4.39) may be proven again

using only the  function identity (a.12). since the method of proof is essentially the same

as for the b2 functional equation we omit the details of the proof.

a.3 b2 twisted solution (4.38)

we next demonstrate that the twisted solution in (4.38) satises the b2 functional equation

(4.35). first we dene a particular untwisted solution x0(u, w) of (4.37) by assigning a special

value of the constant b = 1/1

xs(u, w) = xl(u, w) = x0(u, w) 

(w  u)
(w)(u)

exp[(1/1) w u],

(a.21)

where 1 is dened in terms of the weierstrass  function as 1  (1). the value of b is
chosen so that x0(u, w) is periodic in the 1 direction

x0(u + 21, w) = x0(u, w).

(a.22)

adding a constant vector to q does not aect the equation fb2(q, ) = 0 so q is shifted as

q  q +

21()
||2

,

in which () is the fundamental weight dual to the simple short root , i.e.

 () = 1,

 () = 0.

then the equation fb2(q, ) = 0 reads

0 =  x0(  q + 1,  ) x0(  q, (2 + ) )

+ x0(( + )  q + 1, ( + ) ) x0((2 + )  q, )
+ x0(  q + 1,( + ) ) x0((2 + )  q, (2 + ) )
+ x0(( + )  q + 1,  ) x0(  q,  ),

where the periodicity of x0(u, w), (a.22), is used. this simply means that

(a.23)

(a.24)

(a.25)

xl(u, w) =

xs(u, w) =

exp[b w u],

(w  u)
(w)(u)
(w  u  1)
(w)(u + 1)

exp[1 w + b w u],

(a.26)

30

satisfy the equation fb2(q, ) = 0. since xl(u, w) here is the same function as in (4.37),

any linear combinations of xs(u, w) from the untwisted solution in (4.37) and in (a.26) also

satisfy the b2 functional equation. requiring that the linear combination should satisfy the

a2 functional equation and that it has a simple pole with unit residue at u = 0, we obtain

x0

s(u, w) = (cid:20) (w  u)

(w)(u)

+

(w  u  1)
(w)(u + 1)

exp[1 w](cid:21) exp[b w u].

(a.27)

this expression for x0

s(u, w) has the following monodromies in u and w:

s(u + 1, w) = x0
x0
x0
s(u + 23, w) = x0
s(u, w + 21) = x0
x0
x0
s(u, w + 43) = x0

s(u, w) exp [(1 + b 1)w] ,
s(u, w) exp [2(3 + b 3)w] ,
s(u, w) exp [2(1 + b 1)u] ,
s(u, w) exp [4(3 + b 3)u] .

(a.28)

it also has the following poles and zeros in the fundamental regions of u and w: simple poles
at u = 0 and w = 0 with residues 1 and 2, respectively, and a zero at u = w/2. it may
also be shown that the twisted solution to the b2 functional equation xs(u, w) in (4.38) has
the same monodromies and poles. this implies that the ratio x0

s(u, w)/xs(u, w) is an elliptic
function in both u and w and has no poles and therefore is a constant. since the residues
are the same at all the poles, the ratio is equal to one and x0

s(u, w) is, in fact, the same as

the twisted solution in (4.38)

a.4 g2 twisted solution (4.41)

the proof that the twisted solutions (4.41) to the g2 functional equation (4.39) follow from

the untwisted solutions proceeds in a similar manner. we start from the particular untwisted

solution xs(u, w) = xl(u, w) = x0(u, w) satisfying fg2(q, ) = 0, with the periodicity (a.22),

and shift q as

q  q +

41()

3||2 ,

in which () is the fundamental weight dual to the simple short root . we obtain

(a.29)

shifting q again by the same amount, or in one step

gives the following equation

, ( + ) ) x0((3 + 2)  q, )
,  ) x0(  q,  ),

(a.30)

(a.31)

(a.32)

where the periodicity of x0(u, w), (a.22), is also used. adding (a.30) and (a.32) together and

using the symmetry of solutions in (a.2) implies that the following functions are solutions

to the g2 functional equation (4.39):

xl(u, w) =

(w  u)
(w)(u)

exp[b w u],

(a.33)

xs(u, w) = (cid:20) (w  u  21

3 )
(w)(u + 21
3 )

exp[(2/3)1 w] +

(w  u  41
3 )
(w)(u + 41
3 )

exp[(4/3)1 w](cid:21) exp[b w u].

again, since xl(u, w) is the same function as in (4.37) an arbitrary linear combination of the

xs(u, w) from (4.37) and (a.33) also satises the g2 functional equation. requiring that the

linear combinations should satisfy the a2 functional equation and that it has a simple pole

with unit residue at u = 0, we obtain

x0

s(u, w) = (cid:20) (w  u)

(w)(u)

exp[(2/3)1 w]

(w  u  21
3 )
(w)(u + 21

3 )
exp[(4/3)1 w](cid:21) exp[b w u].
(w)(u + 41

(a.34)

this function has the following monodromies:

x0
s(u +

s(u + 23, w) = x0
s(u, w + 21) = x0

s(u, w) exp [2(3 + b 3)w] ,
s(u, w) exp [2(1 + b 1)u] ,
s(u, w) exp [6(3 + b 3)u] .

(a.35)

the following properties of x0
s(u, w) can be shown. it has poles and zeros in the fundamental
regions of u and w: simple poles at u = 0 and w = 0 with residues 1 and 3, respectively,
and a zero at u = w/3. since it may be shown that the twisted solution xs(u, w) to the g2
functional equation in (4.41) has the same monodromies, poles and zeros as x0
same argument as in the b2 case given above, x0

s(u, w), by the
s(u, w) = xs(u, w) and the solutions derived

above are the same as the twisted solutions in (4.41).

a.5 dihedral solutions (4.44), (4.45)

next, it will be shown that the solutions (4.44) and (4.45) satisfy the dihedral i2(m) func-

tional equations (4.42) for odd or even m, respectively. we assume that all roots are of

the same length, even for an even integer m, since they may be made so by a redeni-

tion of the coupling constants. first consider the case of an odd integer m and arbitrary

n = 1, . . . , [m/2]. substituting the functions

w(cid:19)
i2(m)(q, ) and redening   |j|2/2 gives

x(u, w) = (cid:18) 1

with h, d, and n arbitrary integers. this identity follows from the property of the i2(m)
roots j+m = j. the vanishing of the o(0) and o(1/2) terms follows from a simple
trigonometric identity (q = |q|(cos t, sin t)):

m

cos(t  j/m) cos(t  (j + n)/m)

(a.39)

the left hand side is a meromorphic function in t with a period  and it is exponentially
decreasing as t  i. it is elementary to show that all the residues of the possible simple
poles 
m , j = 1, 2, . . . , m vanish. thus (a.39) vanishes. this shows that the dihedral
functional equation (4.42) for odd m is satised by the functions in (a.36). including the

2 + j

symmetry of solutions of (a.2) implies that the more general solution in (4.44) also satises

(4.42).

next consider the case of even m and odd n in the functional equation (4.42). substi-

tuting the functions

(a.42)

with h an even integer and d and n arbitrary integers. the o(0) and o(1/2) terms

are proportional to the corresponding terms for m odd given above and therefore vanish.

including the symmetry of (a.2), the solution of (4.45) satises (4.42) for m even and n

odd.

34

for the case of the solutions for the i2(m) functional equation for even m and even n,

note that f n

i2(m)(q, ) may be written as

i2(m/2)(q, )

(a.43)

i2(m/2)(q, ) is proportional to f n/2

here gn/2
and so the vanishing of f n

i2(m/2)(q, ) with the i2(m/2) roots rotated by /m
i2(m)(q, ) follows using the previous equation and induction on n.
therefore the solutions in (4.45) solve the i2(m) functional equation (4.42) for all m and n.
