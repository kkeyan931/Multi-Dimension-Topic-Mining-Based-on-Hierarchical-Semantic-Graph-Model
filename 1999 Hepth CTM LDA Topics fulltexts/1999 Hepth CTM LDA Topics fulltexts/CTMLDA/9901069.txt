(17) note omitted density weight bij expression. discussion follows, treat bij lie-algebra two-form, density weight b irrelevant. second proposition states intersection condition pair simple two- forms ensures share common one-form factorizing them: b = 0 bij = u b ij = v. (18) moreover, common factor vi uniquely determined scaling b b proportional other. case b b proportional other, statement trivially holds, common form vi determined uniquely: linear combination one-form also common form. let us discuss meaning normalization condition. imposing normaliza- tion condition two pairs simple two-forms, pair constructed taking dierent outer products 4 one-forms, xes relative normalization two two-forms. words, given four simple two-forms bij = nu ij = n w b ij = n u b b ij = n z, b = b  conditions imply nn = n n long four vectors linearly independent. (19) ij , b13 ij , . . . b1d let us see assertions imply theory. first, consider set two-forms b12 ij . according simplicity relations, two-forms factors one-forms, according intersection relations pair shares unique common factor. note assumption b generic implies two-forms b ij non-zero bs proportional other. let vi non-zero one- form shared b12 ij ; ui one-form shared b14 ij . three possibilities: one-forms ui, vi, wi span linear space rank (i) 3; (ii) 2; (iii) 1. let us consider case separately. ij ; wi one-form shared b13 ij b12 ij b13 ij b14 case (i). since ui vi distinct one-forms divide b12 ij , two-form ij = cu. likewise, express remaining two given product ui, vi: b12 bivectors completely terms three vectors. thus, have: 7 b12 b13 b14 ij = cu ij = cv ij = cw. (20) case (ii). let us assume, without loss generality, vi = wi. vector divides b12, b13 b14, ui divides b12 b14. b12 b14 proportional, excluded generic b. case (iii). let us assume, without loss generality, ui = vi = wi. then, denitions, see vector must divide three bivectors. thus, write b12 b13 b14 ij = u ij = u ij = u (21) suitable vectors pi, qi, ri. four dimensions, case (i) associated so-called topological sector (13) (see {$9804185$} discussion sector), case (iii) associated gravity sector. dimension higher four, however, case (i) cannot occur since have, instance, two-form b15 ij reckon with. two-form must factor common three two-forms considered previously. case (i) , factor common three two-forms. possibility b15 proportional instance b12 possible generic b. thus, forced case (iii), which, assume three bivectors distinct, common factor ui. conclude ui divides b15 ij well. continuing reasoning, see ui must divide two-forms b1 ij . e] . . . ed e divides b repeating arguments dierent values spacetime indices, conclude exist one-forms e1 generic case, vectors pairwise distinct, implies b ij = (e)ke j . odd dimensions always absorb minus sign ij = |e|e j . substituting solution constraints back action, nd s = z ddx |e|e j f ij (22) 8 simply standard palatini action terms frame eld e. thus, classical theory indeed reformulation general relativity. note theorem deals case b eld non-degenerate. would interesting see constraints (10) imply case b degenerate. relevance classical theory, one allow degenerate metrics. however, case degenerate b eld may quite relevant quantum theory, where, example 2+1 gravity suggests, degenerate metrics play important role. thus, would quite interesting study degenerate sectors analyze quantization. address important problem present paper, hoping return future. analysis degenerate sectors case four dimensions see {$9804185$} b. gauge transformations subsection deals issue dependence constraints (10). show fact constraints independent implies presence additional gauge symmetry theory. also discuss problem nding independent subset constraints. action functional (2) invariant three dierent sets gauge transformations. two these, spacetime dieomorphisms frame rotations, familiar need discuss here, third specic new formulation arises fact constraints (10) independent four spacetime dimensions. d)2 = d2(d 1)2/4 components b understand redundancy, let us nd number constraints need imposed guarantee b eld comes frame, compare number number constraints (10). dimensions, d2 components e (c 2 ij , means need number independent constraints equal dierence two numbers, is, d2(d2 2d 3)/4. number constraints calculated looking equations (10) one obtains varying action respect lagrange multipliers . free indices equation  anti-symmetric pairs (, ), (, ). equations symmetric pairs. thus, number equations (10) equal product c 4 d, dimension index , number d(c 2 d+1) independent entrees symmetric c 2 equations. 2 however, equations simply denitions coecients c  , see (11). thus, get number constraints imposed (10), subtract number number components c  . this, nally, gives c 2 c 2 matrix. gives c 4 c 4 c 2 d(c 2 + 1) 2 (c 4 d)2 constraints. case four dimensions, number equals 20, exactly number constraints needed go b eld frame. however, already dimensions number much larger number independent constraints needed: 250 constraints (10) 75 independent constraints necessary. bottom line constraints needed > 4. since, 9 proved, solution set constraints, simply means highly redundant > 4. thus, fact constraints follow action principle independent cause problems classically. however, may lead problems quantum theory, example, denition partition function. indeed, partition function integrate set lagrange multipliers ijkl . integration leads formally delta distribution constraint c ijkl k ijkl k  ijkl k ijkl b . , (23) (24) constraints independent, integration lagrange multipliers leads products delta functions ill-dened. thus, one may worry partition function theory well-dened. standard strategy deal problem gauge xing. show below, fact constraints independent implies additional gauge symmetry theory. gauge xing symmetry amounts nding independent set constraints. exhibit independent set. additional gauge symmetry present redundancy constraints given following transformation multiplier elds: ijkl = ijklmn b mn.
