abstract

we construct the nite energy path between topologically distinct vacua of a 4 dimen-
sional so(4) higgs model which is known to support an instanton, and show that there is
a sphaleron with chern-simons number ncs = 1
2 at the top of the energy barrier. this is
carried out using the original geometric loop construction of manton.

introduction

the basic so(4) higgs model [1] in 4 dimensions supports instanton solutions, that are evaluated
numerically [2]. this model is arrived at by dimensional descent from the 8 dimensional yang-
mills action [3] stabilised by the 4-th chern class. it is also expected that in the static limit this
system supports sphaleron solutions, as described in ref. [4] where such solutions were however
not evaluated numerically.

subsequently, in a dierent context, monopole solutions to a generalised so(3) higgs model
(generalising the georgi-glashow model in 3 dimensions) were numerically [5] evaluated, which
happen to describe the sphaleron solution of the 4 dimensional so(4) higgs model concerning
us in the present work. we will explain this connection here and will construct the nite energy
path between two topologically distinct vacua describing the geometric non contractible loop
(ncl) [6], with the sphaleron of chern-simons number ncs = 1
2 at its top. these are the results
reported in the present note. before proceeding to these technical tasks, we note some properties
of this model and its extensions, which may be of some physical relevance.

there are two distinct physical justications for studying this model and some extensions.
the rst is that some extended versions of it, which certainly [2] support instantons, are capable
of describing a coulomb gas of instantons. this allows the attempt at extending the work of
polyakov [7] exploiting a coulomb gas of instantons in three dimensions, to four dimensions.
(work in this direction is under active consideration.) the second physical relevance of this
model is in the fact that it supports both instantons and sphalerons, in contrast for example
to the standard electroweak model which supports only the latter, and whose instantons have
shrinking size unless if constrained instantons [8] are employed. it is known that theories which
support both nite-size instantons and sphalerons on the one hand, and those which support only
sphalerons on the other, have quite distinct properties concerning the contribution of periodic
instantons [9] relative to that of the sphaleron and the instanton. this situation has been clearly
demonstrated in ref. [10], in the case of various (1+1) dimensional o(3) sigma models with the
above described relative properties.

in section 2, we present the model and explain how the generalised monopole [5] gives the
sphaleron solution. this is done using a ncl ansatz [6]. in section 3, we construct the nite
energy barrier as a ncl with the sphaleron at the top. section 4 is devoted to a discussion of
our results in the context of some extensions of the model used here, which help to highlight the
physical relevance of these results and point out the theoretical obstacles that must be tackled.

2 the model and its properties

we consider a model in d = 4 spacetime dimensions, consisting of a so(4) gauge eld taking its
values in the so(4) algebra with generators  =  1
4 [, ] and a higgs quartet eld a which we
write in antihermitean isovector matrix representation,  = a5a and given by the euclidean
lagrangian [1]

with

l = tr(cid:16)s2

 + 44s2

 + 183s2

 + 542s2

 + 541s4(cid:17)

(1)

s = {f[ , f]}
s = {f[ , d]}
s = i ({s, f} + [d, d])
s = i{s, d}

s = (2 + 2)

(2)

the curvature is given by f = [a] + [a, a], and the covariant derivative is dened by
d =  + [a, ]. the coupling constants are assumed to be positive, a > 0. the instanton
solutions to this system were evaluated numerically in ref. [2]. their salient properties are that
they are exponentially localised and, the connection is not asymptotically pure gauge, both in
contrast to the bpst [11] instanton. the rst of these properties results in the nite size of
the instanton, xed by the absolute scale . the second property results because the asymptotic
gauge eld decays as one half times a pure gauge, rather like a t hooft-polyakov monopole [12]. a
very important consequence is that the curvature eld of this instanton features an inverse-square
decay, leading to the possibility of constructing a coulomb gas of instantons [2].

the existence of nite size instantons ensures that the basic model (1) has topologically
distinct vacua separated by energy barriers of nite height. to construct a path connecting two

vacua over the barrier in the space of static congurations with nite energy e = r h d3x [4]

where h is the static hamiltonian

h = tr(cid:16)44s2

ijk + 183s2

ij + 542s2

i + 541s4(cid:17) ,

(3)

we follow a standard geometrical technique [6] exploiting the topological properties of the model,
resulting from the requirement of nite energy.

the higgs eld of any static nite energy conguration has to satisfy ||2 = 2 at spatial
innity (ir3) = s2
space 
higgs. this property allows to consider a one parameter set of static eld congurations 
s3
parametrised by a loop parameter   [0, ] := iloop such that these elds at spatial innity
dene a topologically nontrivial mapping

space, hence any nite energy conguration denes a mapping  : s2

(r  ) :=  : s2

space  iloop  s3  s3

(4)

which maps s2
[6] choice of such a mapping is given by

space to s3

higgs for any xed value of   (0, ). a simple, geometrically motivated

~p(, , ) := 


sin  sin  cos

sin  cos  (cos   1)

.




(5)

finite energy also requires the covariant derivative to vanish at spatial innity. this xes the

gauge elds ai, a4  0 (temporal gauge) along the loop at innity to

ai(r  ) =: a

i = 

1
42 [ , i ] = pp

i 

(6)

with ~pi = i~p.

the loop itself has to start ( = 0) and end ( = ) in the vacuum which we choose to be
(v ) = 53, a(v )
i = 0. this allows the gauge eld along the loop to be chosen proportional to
the gauge eld at innity, introducing a radial prole function f (r), whereas the higgs eld has
to be deformed to reach the vacua:

 = h(r)  + (1  h(r)),

ai = (1 + f (r)) a

i

(7)

with  = 5[3 cos2   4 sin  cos  ]. the prole functions h(r) and f (r) are subject to the
boundary conditions

h(0) = 0,

f (0) = 1;

h(r  ) = 1,

f (r  ) = 0,

(8)

resulting from the requirements of regularity at the origin and nite energy. the loop resulting
from this construction is noncontractible as  was chosen to be a topologically nontrivial
mapping.

inserting the ansatz into the static hamiltonian (3) and multiplying by the radial integration

measure, we obtain the radial subsystem

h( )[h, f ] = 966 sin4 "44( 1

2 (cid:18)h(1  f 2)h + 2f wi2

+ 91n2(h2  1)4 sin4 o

w := h  (1 + f )(cos2  + h sin2  ).

it should be emphasised that extrema of the radial subsystem (9) are not necessarily extrema
of the static hamiltonian (3) as the ansatz (7) is in general not spherically symmetric. never-
theless, besides the (spherically symmetric) vacua for  = 0 and  = , the loop ansatz reduces
to a spherically symmetric ansatz for  = 
2 ,

(11)

for this value  = 
2 , the radial subsystem loop hamiltonian (9) reduces to the radial subsystem
hamiltonian of the generalised so(3) higgs monopole system [13] (the coupling constants have to
be adjusted to a 7 1
a a, a = 1, 2, 3, 4)) for which solutions (h(m ), f (m )) are known numerically.
due to spherical symmetry, inserting these monopole prole functions into the ansatz (11)
yields an extremum of the static energy functional (3). since by construction this extremum
appears along a path connecting two vacua, it is expected to be a saddle point. this becomes
manifest if one inserts the monopole prole functions (h(m ), f (m )) into the loop hamiltonian (9)

and considers the energy e( ) = r h( )[h(m ), f (m )]dr along the loop which can be calculated
numerically using the data known from the monopole analysis [13], e.g. for coupling constants
a = 1
a , a = 1, 2, 3, 4. fig. 1 shows that for this loop, e( ) really reaches its maximum for  = 
2
which shows that the extremum we found is indeed an instable saddle point, hence the sphaleron
of the basic model (1).

it is a special feature of the geometrical ncl construction that the spherically symmetric
loop conguration (11) involves only a higgs triplet (i = 1, 2, 3) and an so(3) gauge eld. this
symmetry breakdown along the loop, together with the fact the the static so(4) higgs hamil-
tonian (3) is formally equal to the generalised so(3) higgs hamiltonian of ref.[13] eq. (3) under
the coupling constant mapping

justies the interpretation that the generalised so(3) higgs monopole [13] is really embed-
ded into the so(4) higgs model under consideration, gaining its instability from the additional
gauge degrees of freedom which are excited along the loop, an eect which also occurs in lower
dimensional so(d) higgs models with instanton and sphaleron [14].

3 ncl, sphaleron and chernsimons number

the construction of the geometrical loop in the previous section was guided by the topological
properties of static nite energy congurations. the sphaleron itself however, is not a topological
object. it can be visualised as top of the static energy barrier separating topologically distinct
vacua, whereas the instanton interpolates between these vacua in euclidean spacetime. this
instanton is topologically stable due to the existence of a lower bound to the euclidean action

the connection between instantons and sphalerons as objects relating topologically distinct
vacua becomes obvious if one interprets the ncl connecting the vacua through the sphaleron as
an object in euclidean spacetime, treating the loop parameter as time t = x0 depend  =  (t)
such that  (t  ) = 0,  (t  ) = . splitting the spacetime integral (15) into two
parts, consisting of a spatial surface and a spatial volumeintegral yields what is called the
chernsimons number at time t0,

integrating over innite time, the chernsimons number equals the chernpontryagin charge,

assuming 0(t  , ~x) = 0 which xes ncs(t  ) = 0 for the initial vacuum, the
volume and surface contributions to the chernsimons number along the loop, respectively, are
then found to be

in particular, the volume integral contribution vanishes if the loop reaches the sphaleron at
time t0 = ts,  (ts) = 
2 , and the chernsimons number of the sphaleron is found to be
ncs(ts) = 1
2. at innite time, t0  , the volume contribution vanishes, and one immediately
nds ncs(t0  ) = 1, relating the ncl interpreted as euclidean spacetime conguration to
the instanton.

the volume integral can be computed numerically, using the monopole prole functions
(h(m ), f (m )) which were also used to evaluate the energy along the loop in the previous sec-
tion. this allows to plot the energy barrier between the two topologically distinct vacua in terms
of increasing chernsimons number as shown in fig. 2.

4 summary and discussion

we have presented the complete construction of the sphaleron solution to the model (1), together
with a nite energy barrier ncl. this completes the verication that this model supports both
nite-size instantons and sphalerons. apart from the relevance of this to the study of the periodic
instantons [9, 10], some extensions of this model are of some physical relevance, which we now
discuss briey. the results obtained here remain qualitatively unchanged under the extensions
discussed below.

the lagrangian (1) can be called the basic model, and is derived from the eightdimensional
generalised yangmills system by dimensional reduction [3]. for physical reasons, it is convenient
to consider an extended model, adding the term

lext = tr(cid:16)1(d)2 + 2s2(cid:17)

(19)

to the euclidean lagrangian (1). the main eect of adding (19) to the basic model is to enable
a time-independent vacuum eld vac = 54. in ref. [2] another extended version incorporating
the term trf ff was considered, to enable the construction of a coulomb gas of instantons.
it is interesting to note that in the absence of (19), the instanton now would be power localised,
the exponential localisation being restored in the presence of (19).

another interesting eect of adding (19) to (1) is the resulting spectrum when the higgs
mechanism is applied. using the notation ~ = (, 4),  = 1, 2, 3, and expanding around the
higgs vacuum 54

 = 5[4( + v) + ] ,

(20)

there appears a mass-like term for an isovector vector eld in the lagrangian. it is the so(3) part
of the gauge eld corresponding to the broken so(3) subgroup of the gauge group. this part of
the so(4) gauge eld uctuation, w 

 = 2a4

 in

a = a

  + w 

 4 ,

consists of the components that do not commute with vac. the higgs eld then has one compo-
nent that stays massive, described by the scalar eld v in (20) and the corresponding goldstone
bosons are swallowed via the gauge so(3) transformation

g = exp

1


4 ,

(21)

leaving the mass-like term 12|w|2 in the lagrangian. strictly speaking this term is not a mass
term in the sense that the accompanying quadratic kinetic term |w   w|2 is absent. this
is the result of the absence of the usual yang-mills term trf 2

 in the lagrangian (1).

this brings us to the nal item of discussion, namely the question of the absence of the ym
term trf 2
 in (1). independently of the dynamics of the so(4) system with the higgs eld in the
4-vector representation, there exists a dirac gauge in which the higgs eld can be gauged to a
constant at innity. it follows that the asymptotic so(4) gauge eld must decay with the inverse
power of r, with an inverse-square decay of the curvature. in 4 dimensions, the contribution of
the ym term trf 2
 in (1) to the action will then be logarithmically divergent. thus, the most
important property of this model (and its extended versions), namely its suitability for describing
a coulomb gas of instantons, prevents the presence of the usual ym term with the consequence
that the gauge eld and its massive component are not endowed with a propagator.

to complete this argument one has to eliminate the following possibility: namely that instead
of exploiting the descendent of the fourth chern-pontryagin charge (14), one exploits the second
chern-pontryagin charge trf

f. in that case, the topological lower bound

tr (f 2

 + higgs terms)  tr (f

f)

(22)

holds and as a result the curvature strength decays as the inverse power of r4, corresponding to an
asymptotically pure-gauge connection like the bpst [11] instanton. the problem here is that the
nite action condition for the higgs terms in (22) results in an asymptotic connection eld that
decays as one half times a pure-gauge, which is inconsistent with the nite action requirement
on the ym terms, namely that the connection be asymptotically pure-gauge.
