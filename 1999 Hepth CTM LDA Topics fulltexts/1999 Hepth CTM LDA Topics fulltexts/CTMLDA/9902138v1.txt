abstract. we give a noncommutative version of the complex projective space cp2
and show that scalar qft on this space is free of uv divergencies. the tools necessary
to investigate quantum elds on this fuzzy cp2 are developed and several possibilities
to introduce spinors and dirac operators are discussed.

keywords: regularization, noncommutative geometry, geometric quantization, cp2

1. introduction

recently methods of noncommutative geometry ([3]) were used to introduce a covariant

regularization procedure for quantum elds on the 2 sphere ([8, 9]). there is hope that

with these methods there will be a nonperturbative understanding of quantum eects.

for a treatment of the chiral anomaly in the schwinger model see [11].

the idea is to approximate the algebra of functions on the space by matrix algebras

and to encode the geometrical information of the space in these algebras. in this way it

becomes possible to construct models of qft on the virtual spaces, the matrix algebras

are thought to be functions on. since the theory has only nite degrees of freedom

the problems one usually deals with in qft are absent. for examples of these matrix

geometries see [17, 18, 7].

we will show that the cp2, as a 4 dimensional riemannian manifold on which the
group su(3) acts isometrically, can by treated in this way. we construct the laplace
operator on the fuzzy cp2 and show that the spectrum is the same as in the classical
case, except for a truncation at higher eigenvalues, which can be interpreted as a uv

cuto. since su(3) acts on the matrix algebras by automorphisms we did not lose the

su(3) covariance by this procedure.

we discuss the quantization of several vector bundles, among them a family of spinc-
bundles, and compare the structures with the classical case. as well as for the functions

we nd that in the quantized sections higher order representations of g are missing. a
straightforward generalization of the classical spinc-dirac operators is introduced and
the spectra are calculated. it turns out, that zero modes and index are dierent from

the commutative case. a possible solution to this problem is presented.

2. the classical case

we start with a group theoretic construction of the classical structures on the cp2. let
gc be the lie group sl3(c) and gc its lie algebra. we choose a cartan subalgebra
and a corresponding system of roots , positive roots +, fundamental roots f , and
use the standard cartan-weyl basis {h}f  {x, x}+. h is the root vector
and x the root element corresponding to the root . f consists of two elements 



+

and  (see figure 1). hence we have

(1)

gc = spanc{h, h, x, x, x, x, x+, x(+)}

the compact real form g  gc is
(2)

g = spanr{ih, ih, x + x, x + x, x+ + x(+),
i(x  x), i(x  x), i(x+  x(+))}

and the corresponding connected subgroup g  gc is the group su(3). the two
fundamental weights are

1 =

(2 + )

2 =

3

( + 2)

we denote the verma module with highest weight  = n11 +n22 by d(n1, n2) the fun-
damental roots chosen such that d(1, 0) corresponds to the fundamental representation

2

of the su(3). the dimensions of these representations are given by

(4)

dim(d(n1, n2)) =

(n1 + 1)(n2 + 1)(n1 + n2 + 2)

and the image of the quadratic casimir element

is the multiplication operator by the number

(6)

c(n1, n2) =

(n2

1 + n2

2 + n1n2 + 3(n1 + n2))

to each verma module there corresponds an (up to equivalence unique) unitary irre-
ducible representation of g and a holomorphic irreducible representation of gc, which
we denote by the same symbol.
let p  gc now be the parabolic subalgebra
(7)

p = spanc{h, h, x, x, x, x(+)}

and p the analytic subgroup of gc with lie algebra p. the quotient space m := gc/p
is a complex ag manifold (see e.g. [22, 20, 21]) and has a compact realization m = g/k
where k is the subgroup of g with lie algebra k := g  p. in our case this is the group
s(u(2)  u(1))  su(3). this is just the subgroup that leaves the lowest weight
subspace of d(1, 0) invariant, and our space m is just the complex projective space
cp2, the space of comlex lines in c3.

m is in a canonical way a kahler manifold. the action of g on m is holomorphic and

leaves the kahler structure invariant. there exists a unique normalized g-left invariant

measure on m which we denote by .

2.1. the quasi-left regular representation. in this section we give the decomposi-
tion of the unitary representation of g on the space l2(m, ), given by the action

(8)

gf (x) = f (g1x)

for the decomposition we use the fact that m is a riemannian symmetric space of
compact type ([14, 15]). this means that there is a real form gr  gc with iwasawa
decomposition gr = kan, where a is the abelian and n the nilpotent part. we denote
by gr, a, n  gc the corresponding real lie algebras. a can be extended to a maximal
abelian lie subalgebra h of gr such that its complexication hc is a cartan subalgebra
of gc. the weights are elements of the dual of the vectorspace hr = i(h  k) + a. we
choose again fundamental roots and denote by + the positive roots that do not vanish
on a and interpret them as linear forms on a. the killing form induces a scalar product
h|i on the dual a. we have

3

theorem 2.1 (helgason). a representation with highest weight  contains a k-invariant

vector if and only if

1. (i(h  k)) = 0
2. h|i

h|i  n0   +

(see [15])

in our case a short calculation shows that one can choose another cartan subalgebra

such that

and with

k = g  spanc{h  h, x + x, x + x, x+ + x(+)}

a = spanr{h + h}

n = spanr{(x  x), (x  x), (x+  x(+))}

gr = k + a + n is a real form of gc. one obtains that the representations of g that
contain a k invariant vector are just the representations with highest weight

(9)

 = n(1 + 2) n  n0

the space of k-invariant vectors in such a representation is furthermore one dimensional

and by frobenius theorem exactly those representations occur with multiplicity one in
the quasi-left regular representation 1.

hence we get for our case the following result

theorem 2.2. let m = cp2 with the canonical su(3) action. as su(3)-modules we
have



l2(m, ) =

d(n, n)

mn=0

and the subspace of l2(m, ) which is, as an su(3)-module, isomorphic to d(n, n) is
just the space of functions of the form

m  c,

uk  huen|vi,

v  d(n, n)

where en  d(n, n) is an (up to a scalar unique) k-invariant vector.

1the quasi-left regular representation on g/k is just the representation of g induced by the trivial

representation of k

4

2.2. the laplace operator. identifying the lie algebra gc with the complex left
invariant vector elds on the group g and those with dierential operators on c (g), we
get a natural action of the universal enveloping algebra u(gc) on c (g). the quadratic
casimir element c becomes is a biinvariant dierential operator g of second order
and is equal to the laplace-beltrami operator of the (up to a scalar unique) biinvariant

metric on g. thus it can be restricted to the k-right invariant functions on g and we
get a dierential operator m : c (m)  c (m). this operator coincides with the
metric laplacian on m. we get

theorem 2.3. the laplace operator m on the cp2 is essentially self-adjoint on
c (cp2). the spectrum of its closure is purely discrete and the eigenvalues  and
multiplicities mult are

n = 2n(n + 1), n  n0

multn = (n + 1)3

proof: we restrict the domain to the nite linear span of vectors in the irreducible
subspaces of the group action, on each of which m acts by multiplication with 2n(n+1).
hence the domain contains a total set of analytic vectors and we found the operator in

its spectral decomposition.



2.3. homogeneous vector bundles over m . the homogeneous vector bundles over

m are in one to one correspondence with the nite dimensional representations of the

group k. if v is a homogeneous vector bundle over m and  the representation of k
at the bre vek at the identity class ek, then v is isomorphic as a g-vector bundle
to the associated bundle g  vek. the sections of this bundle can be identied with
the equivariant vek-valued functions on g, that is the functions f that satisfy the
equivariance condition f (xk) =  (k1)f (x) x  g, k  k.
the homogeneous vector bundles over m have a canonical holomorphic structure since

 can be extended to a holomorphic representation  of p and the vector bundle can
be constructed as gc  vek .
we dene several useful bundles on m. let  (n) for n  z be the irreducible (one
dimensional) representation of k with highest weight n2. we denote the homoge-
neous line bundle g  (n) c by ln. for example l is the hyperplane bundle and l1
the tautological line bundle over m.

let  be the representation of k with highest weight 1 and  the dual representation,
we dene h and h 1 to be the bundles g  c2 and g  c2 respectively.

5

since the irreducible representations of k are unitary these vector bundles have natural
hermitian structures, and we denote by 2(v ) the hilbert space of square integrable
sections and by hol(v ) the nite dimensional hilbert space of holomorphic sections of
the bundle v . the representation of g on 2(g v ) is just the representation induced
by  .

theorem 2.4. for the bundles ln we have the following isomorphisms of g-modules

m=0 d(m, m + n)
m=0 d(m  n, m)

1. for n  0: 2(ln) =l
2. for n < 0: 2(ln) =l
sketch of proof: we specialize to n  0 since the proof is analogous for the other case.
the sections of ln will be identied with the equivariant functions on g. for each
section f there is a family of k-right invariant functions (fi)i=1...dim(d(0,n)) on g, such
that

dim(d(0,n))

f (x) =

fi(x)hxhn|vii

xi=1

where hn is a nonzero highest weight vector and {vi}i=1...dim(d(0,n)) an orthonormal basis
in d(0, n). to see this simply choose fi(x) = f (x)hvi|xhni. hence using theorem 2.2
the subspace

w := spanc{h  em|u(m)ih  hn|vi : u(m)  d(m, m), v  d(0, n), m  n0}

is dense in 2(ln). the subspaces

w n := spanc{h  em|u(m)ih  hn|vi : u(m)  d(m, m), v  d(0, n), m  n}
dene a ltration of w. a short calculation using d(0, m)  d(m, 0) = m
gives
w n = spanc{h  hn+m|u(m+n)ih  lm|v(m)i : u(m)  d(0, n + m), v(m)  d(m, 0), m  n}
where lm is a nonzero lowest weight vector in d(m, 0). since d(0, m + n)  d(m, 0) =
m
i=0d(i, i + n) and the vector hn+m  lm  d(0, n + m)  d(m, 0) is cyclic, we can
choose a family of nonzero vectors em  d(m, m + n) such that

i=0d(i, i)

w n = spanc{h  em|v(m)i : v(m)  d(m, m + n), m  n}

and therefore

w = spanc{h  em|v(m)i : v(m)  d(m, m + n), m  n0}

this establishes the desired isomorphism of modules.



the same method allows us to decompose the representation on the space of sections

of another class of bundles

6

theorem 2.5. for the bundles ln  h 1 we have the following isomorphisms of g-
modules

1. for n  0: 2(ln  h 1) =l
2. for n < 0: 2(ln  h 1) =l

m=0(d(m, m + n + 2)  d(m + 1, m + n))
m=0(d(m  n  1, m + 1)  d(m  n + 1, m))

since g acts on m by holomorphic automorphisms the bundles of antiholomorphic
k-forms 0,k are homogeneous vector bundles. the vector space of antiholomorphic
tangent vectors at ek can be identied with the nilpotent radical u of the parabolic
subalgebra p  gc, which is just spanc{x(+), x}. the isotropy representation is
the adjoint action of k on u. taking the dual representations this leads to the following

isomorphisms of g-bundles.

(10)

0,0 = l0
0,1 = l  h 1
0,2 = l3

2.4. spinc-bundles. it is well known that the cp2 does not admit a spin-structure. it
does however admit a spinc-structure and we give here a family of spinc-bundles. since
m is a kahler manifold the bundle of antiholomorphic forms 0, with the natural z2-
grading is a canonical spinc-bundle and the dolbeault-dirac operator d = 2( + 

)
is a spinc-dirac operator (see e.g. [16]). tensoring this bundle with some line bundle
we obtain other spinc-bundles.

tensoring the canonical spinc-bundle s with the line bundle lm and using the above
described isomorphisms of g-bundles we get the spinc-bundles sm:

(11)

m = lm  lm+3
s+
m = lm+1  h 1

sm = s+

the sections of sm are identied with the c4-valued functions  on g which satisfy the

where x is the dierential operator corresponding to the left invariant vector eld x

theorem 2.6. the spinc-dirac operator dm is essentially self-adjoint on the space of
smooth sections of sm. the spectrum of its closure is purely discrete. the eigenvalues

the abstract foldy-wouthuysen transformation and the decompositions of the g-modules
(lm), (lm+3), and (lm+1  h 1) gives the desired result.



3. quantization of the cp2

since m is a compact kahler manifold and l a quantum line bundle we can use the
berezin-toeplitz quantization procedure (see e.g. [2]). we x an n  n0 and let n
be the orthogonal projection onto the subspace hn := hol(ln )  2(ln ). for each
f  c (m) we get an operator t n (f )  end(hn ), dened by

t n (f ) := n mf n

where mf is the multiplication-operator associated with f . the corresponding surjective
map c (m)  end(hn ) is called toeplitz quantization map. the algebra an :=
end(hn ) is the algebra of quantized functions, which for high values of n approximates
the algebra c (m) in a certain sense.

8

by the bott-borel-weyl theorem (see [20, 21]) we have the isomorphism of g-modules
hn = d(0, n). identifying these two spaces we obtain for the quantized algebra of
functions the matrix algebra

(13)

an = mat(
on which g acts by inner automorphisms

(n + 1)(n + 2)

, c)

2

(14)

g  an  an :

(g, a)  (g)a1(g)

where  is the representation which corresponds to the g-module d(0, n). if pn is the
orthogonal projection onto the highest weight subspace of hn we dene the coherent
state function on m by

(15)

pn : m  end(hn ),

gk  (g) pn 1(g)

and we get for the toeplitz quantization map

(16)

t n

f =

(n + 1)(n + 2)

2

zm

which is equivariant, real, positive, and norm decreasing.

f (x)pn (x)d(x)

moreover the following results hold

theorem 3.1.

1. the restriction tn := t n|e n ist bijective.
2. limn(tn )1t n (f ) = f in the uniform topology on c (m)
3. for f1 . . . fn  c (m) we have with the c -norms on the an :
for n  

f1fnk = o(

f1    t n

fn  t n

kt n

1

)

4. if tr1() is the normalized trace on an , we have:

zm

f (x)d(x) = tr1(t n

f ) f  c (m), n  n0

5. for f1 . . . fn  c (m) holds:

zm
f k = kfksup + o( 1
n )

f1(x)    fn(x)d(x) = tr1(t n
for n  

6. kt n

f1    t n

fn) + o(

1
n

)

for n  

here e n  c (m) is the space of truncated functions, that is the subspace that
contains only the g-representations d(n, n) for n  n.
it follows that as g-modules an and n
cut-o automated by the quantization. one introduces now the linear inclusions

n=0d(n, n) are isomorphic. this is a kind of

(17)

in : an  an +1,

a  tn +1(tn )1a

9

and the sequence

(18)

(a, i) := a0

i1 . . .

in 1

 an

in an +1

in +1

 . . .

the vector space limit of this sequence is in a canonical way a normed space and its
closure has the structure of a c -algebra, the product being the limit n   of the
products in the single algebras. this algebra can be shown to be isomorphic to the

algebra of continuous functions on m. moreover the isomorphism can be chosen to be
equivariant. in this sense the sequence approximates the cp2. we therefore understand
the algebras an as the algebra of functions on the virtual fuzzy cp2 of order n. this
requires however to have as a correspondence principle the toeplitz quantization maps

or equivalently the above sequence in mind.

4. the laplace operator on the fuzzy cp2

since g acts on an by inner automorphisms we get by dierentiation an action of the
if  is the representation of gc which
lie algebra gc = sl3(c) by inner derivations.
corresponds to the gc-module d(0, n) this action reads as follows

(19)

xa = [(x), a] x  gc, a  an

this gives a representation of the universal enveloping algebra u(gc) and we dene in
analogy to the commutative case the laplace operator

(20)

n : an  an

to be the image of the quadratic casimir element, or more explicitly:

n a := x+

(xx + xx) + xf

1
2

h 2

! a

since the quantization map is equivariant we have

(21)

(22)

n (a) = tn(cid:0)m (tn )1(a)(cid:1)

using the decomposition of the gc-module an one gets easily
theorem 4.1. the eigenvalues  of the laplacian n and their multiplicities mult
are:

n = 2n(n + 2), multn = (n + 1)3 n  {0, . . . , n}

the spectrum shows the expected uv cuto.
the above action of gc on an can be thought of as a lie algbera homomorphism from
gc to the lie algebra of derivations der(an ) of the algebra. the image, as a subspace
of der(an ), gives rise to a derivation based dierential culculus on an (see [4]). with

10

the natural scalar product on the one-forms the laplace operator has the natural form
n = dd, as in the commutative case.

5. quantization of homogeneous vector bundles over cp2

vector bundles in the noncommutative case should be nitly generated projective mod-

ules over the algebra. in [13] the concept of toeplitz quantization was generalized to

the quantization of bundles.

let e be a holomorphic hermitian vector bundle with base m and e be the dual
bundle. let furthermore hn
e be the hilbert space of holomorphic sections of the bundle
e  ln , that is hn
(23)

e := hol(e  ln ). using the orthogonal projection

n  b(l2(m, e  ln ))
e

e , we can dene the surjective map

onto hn
(24)

t n
e :

(m, e)  homc(hn

e ,hn ),

  n e

according to [12] this gives the quantization of the bundle e in the following sense

then by the bott-borel-weyl theorem

(27)

hol(e  ln ) = d(n1, n  n1  n2)

as g-modules, if we set by denition d(n1, n2) = {0} if n1 < 0 or n2 < 0.

5.1. the bundles e = ln. the isotropy representation of ln was  (n), which had
highest weight n2, and one obtains

(28)

hol(e  ln ) = d(0, n  n)

the quantization of the bundles ln is therefore given by the an -modules m n
(29)

ln = homc(d(0, n  n), d(0, n)).

with highest weight 1 + n2. this yields

(32)

hol(e  ln ) = d(1, n  n  1).

this gives as a quantization of ln  h 1 the modules

index(dm) = dim(ker(dm))  dim(ker(d

remark 6.5. the index and the number of zero modes are dierent from the commu-

tative case. that is because the maps n vanish also on higher representations. apart
from this the spectrum is truncated, as we expected.

the dirac operator denes for each m  n and n  max(2, m + 3) an even spectral
triple (a,h, d) with

a = an
h = m n
d = dm

sm

which gives a dierential calculus over the algebra an .

we can use the same procedure to dene a dirac operator, which except for a spectral

cuto has the same spectrum as the classical dirac operator. in particular the index

and zero modes are classical. in this case we lose the an -module property, the space
is however a module over the algebra an  an +2  an +1. this will be investigated
elsewhere.

7. conclusions and outlook

the tools provided in this paper make it possible to investigate scalar qft on the
fuzzy cp2, which is free of any divergencies, since the algebra of functions is nite
dimensional and allows to construct a well dened functional integral. the attempt to

construct spinors led to similar diculties as for the known case of the fuzzy sphere.

there the use of supersymmetry provided a solution ([9, 10]). it seems promising to
use a similar extension for the cp2. noncommutative generalizations of the dolbeault
operators might as well lead to structures proposed in [6].
