(2.9) (2.10) let us also assume central charge positive k0, i.e. z(0) > 0. otherwise would consider problem opposite charge. dierentiating z(t), one nds rst derivative z (t) = (k3)4/3(cid:0)(q k)(k3) (q k)(k k k)(cid:1) . (2.11) suppose z(t) critical point tc z (tc) = 0. second derivative tc expressed z (tc) = 2(k3)4/3(q k)(cid:18) (k k k)2 = 2(k3)4/3(q k)(bij kikj). k3 k k k(cid:19) bilinear form bij following properties: exactly one eigenvalues zero language (namely k-direction) eigenvalues positive. 6 calabi-yau geometry holds2 rx k k k < 0 k satises rx k k k = 0. k would proportional k(t) = k0 + tk t, would nd k0 k1 fact equal. thus k necessarily piece orthogonal k(t) bij kikj > 0 strictly. language supergravity statement follows fact form b proportional metric restricted directions tangent moduli space, k k k = 0, see (2.3). zero eigenvalue k-direction simply scale invariance z(k). inequality expressed following words: positive central charge critical point along straight line fact local minimum! negative z every critical point along straight line local maximum. well known critical point central charge minimum considered function moduli. much stronger statement. see one-dimensional subspace (a projection straight line) critical point fact local minimum. use observation follows. central charge z local mini- mum attractor point k0 denition. therefore must grow continuously straight line emanating k0 never achieve second local minimum. moreover, see central charge global minimum k0 entire kahler cone. let us remark another consequence observation. consider level sets central charge function, i.e sets z < constant a. note sets necessarily convex. otherwise, could connect two points inside level set line segment venturing outside it, would maximum central charge line segment, contradicts observation. 3. extended kahler cone 3.1. review single kahler cone discussed part full vector moduli space.3 boundaries kahler cone correspond actual boundaries moduli space. boundaries calabi-yau undergoes op transition, 2 see instance , page 123. note misprint there; say 2k = p + q. 3 see {$9603150$} discussion. 7 curve collapses zero size, one may continue wall arrive dierent geometric phase. one another calabi-yau birationally equivalent original one. share hodge numbers dierent triple intersection numbers. terms original kahler moduli, collapsed curve nite negative area side wall. dimensions interpretation phase transition bps hypermultiplet goes positive negative mass. union kahler cones calabi-yaus related sequence op transitions called extended kahler cone. geometrically one cannot go beyond boundaries extended cone. also argued boundaries nite distance physical vector moduli space ends {$9603150$}. cross wall adjacent cone may take linear combinations kahler parameters ki order get acceptable set moduli yield positive areas two- four-cycles. nd convenient stick original ki, even though sometimes yield negative areas outside original cone. induction, may still use ki pass second op transition third cone, on. calabi-yau adjacent cone dierent intersection numbers, means adjust prepotential new cone. well known prepotential changes one passes wall: denote area collapsing curve negative side wall,  k k k k k k (#p1) m3.

(3.2) cubic terms second term z cancel, put z (t) = (k3)4/3r(t) r(t) polynomial degree two. (k3)4/3 nonnegative, focus r(t). assumption = 0 local minimum z, i.e. root r(t) r > 0. recall attractor point start positive value central charge. important positive z physical root r(t) one rst derivative positive possibly zero root opping wall. root r(t) physical, i.e. lies outside original kahler cone. thus z(t) one critical point cone, another proof uniqueness single cone. see happens adjacent cone. first need know point z(t) q k(t) vanishes, call t0. denition may write q k(t) = q k0 + q k = q k0 (1 t/t0) (3.3) cross opping wall = tf prepotential changes (3.1) k3 k3 + c(t tf )3 11 c > 0. must also modify z (t) > tf : z (t)(cid:12)(cid:12)t>tf = (k3 + c(t tf )3)4/3(cid:0)r(t) + c(q k q k0)(t tf )2(cid:1) = (k3 + c(t tf )3)4/3(cid:18)r(t) + c q k0(cid:18) tf 1(cid:19) (t tf )2(cid:19) = (k3 + c(t tf )3)4/3p (t). t0 interested physical roots p (t) tf . long z(t) positive roots p 0. z(t) positive > 0 t0 < 0 t0 > 0 positive < t0. cases constant c q k0(cid:16) tf t0 1(cid:17) negative. first show < 0 physical roots p (t) tf . simply nd root tr p 0 show tr < tf . also imply z(t) may start decreasing therefore cannot become negative inside extended moduli space. write r(t) = at2 + bt b > 0 since = 0 minimum z. need nd roots quadratic equation p (t) = at2 + bt + a(t tf )2 = 0 root derivative p (t) nonnegative, exists, always given tr = 2atf b +pb2 + 4tf (a)(b + atf ) 2(a + a) four cases consider depending value coecient a. 1. b/tf < 0, note + < 0 b + atf < 0, see fig. 1. case may roots, are, tr < 2atf b 2(a + a) 2atf + atf 2(a + a) < tf . case physical, second root r(t) inside original kahler cone gives unphysical maximum central charge. include case future reference. 12 0 rt tf r(t) p(t) fig. 1 2. b/tf < < a, still + < 0 b + atf > 0. always roots tr < = 2atf b +pb2 + 4tf (b + atf ) 2(a + a) 2atf b + |b + 2atf | 2(a + a) 2atf b + b + 2atf 2(a + a) = tf . (3.4) 3. = > 0. case p (t) linear. one root, satises tr = t2 f b + 2atf < tf . 4. < a, see fig. 2. item 2 replace inside square root. resulting equations exactly (3.4). r(t) p(t) 0 rt tf fig. 2. 13 found p (t) doesnt physical roots new kahler cone. means z(t) doesnt critical points therefore continues grow go away attractor. follows need consider case central charge negative. crossing several walls handled induction. polynomial p (t) wall plays role r(t) next crossing. shown p (t) root p > 0, lies left new wall, therefore situation started. let us comment (im)possibility critical point z(t) lies opping wall local maximum. would correspond situation r r vanish (recall r cannot negative critical point continuity positivity metric away opping wall). point described situation item 4 b = 0, tf = 0 roots r(t) 0. r(t) positive left wall p (t) negative right it, critical point local maximum. however, r(t) cannot double zero tf shown always one root strictly left wall. therefore critical points arise. finally, left consider case k0 lies opping wall. p (t) may either positive negative right wall. former case z(t) starts growing > 0 analysis made earlier carries changes. latter case k0 may local maximum directions precisely described previous paragraph. dierence begin situation cannot argue r(t) double root wall. case central charge decreases = 0 may eventually become negative. still positive rst wall crossing described essentially situation item 1 above, b = 0. clear p (t) roots subsequent wall crossings z(t) > 0. moreover, every cone p (t) downward-pointing parabola apex left left wall. central charge becomes negative discussion changes two ways. first, crossing wall constant change r(t) p (t) becomes positive: r(t) p (t) = r(t) + a(t tf )2, > 0. second, physical critical points roots r(t) rst derivative negative possibly zero root opping wall. 14 now, z(t) decreasing becomes negative, therefore rst critical point may wall cone r(t) double zero. assume critical point exists, right r(t) would downward pointing parabola double zero wall. move backwards reconstruct polynomials r(t) p (t) preceding cones. taking account constant positive subtracted, see z negative r(t) every cone downward pointing parabola roots apex right right wall. cone z crosses zero obtain conradiction previous analysis found apex parabola left left wall. therefore, cannot multiple attractor points even lie walls kahler cones. 4. discussion paper demonstrated critical point central charge z unique exists. moreover, z minimum (maximum) critical point grow (decrease)
