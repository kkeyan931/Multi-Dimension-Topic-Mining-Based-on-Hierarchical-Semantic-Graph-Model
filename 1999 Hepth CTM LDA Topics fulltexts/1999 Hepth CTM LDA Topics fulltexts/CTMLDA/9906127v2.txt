abstract

the divergences of the gravitational action are analyzed for spacetimes that

are asymptotically anti-de sitter and asymptotically at. the gravitational

action is rendered nite using a local counterterm prescription, and the relation

of this method to the traditional reference spacetime is discussed. for ads, an

iterative procedure is devised that determines the counterterms eciently. for

asymptotically at space, we use a dierent method to derive counterterms

which are sucient to remove divergences in most cases.

1 introduction

the concepts of action and energy-momentum play central roles in theories with

gravity, but they are surprisingly dicult to dene (see, e.g., [1]), and they are often

laborious to compute. a well known obstacle to the straightforward denition of the

gravitational action in a non-compact space is that the sum of the einstein-hilbert and

gibbons-hawking terms diverges. there is a standard remedy for this calamity: rst

regulate the divergence by restricting the spacetime to the interior of some bounding

surface, then subtract the (similarly innite) action of some reference spacetime with

the same boundary geometry [2]. for an appropriately chosen reference spacetime,

the resulting action will be nite as the boundary is taken to innity. the energy-

momentum tensor of the spacetime is then related to the variation of the total action

with respect to the boundary metric [3].

the above procedure suers from a number of important drawbacks. on a con-

ceptual level, it is not satisfying since it relies on the introduction of a spacetime

which is auxiliary to the problem. it is sometimes said that this merely corresponds

to dening the overall zero of energy, but in fact the procedure also aects relative

energies, because dierent reference spacetimes are needed for dierent boundary ge-

ometries. a more glaring defect is that the procedure is generally ill-dened, since it

is not possible to embed an arbitrary boundary geometry in the reference spacetime.

one is forced to resort to an approximate embedding, and this often leads to confu-

sion and ambiguity; good examples of this are taub-nut and taub-bolt spacetimes

[4, 6, 5, 7, 8].

recently, a preferable alternative procedure has been proposed [9]. for a manifold

with boundary, the only way to modify the gravitational action without disturbing

the equations of motion or the symmetries is to add a coordinate invariant functional

of the intrinsic boundary geometry. by choosing a functional  which we refer to as a

counterterm  which cancels the divergences, one arrives at well dened expressions

for the action and energy-momentum of the spacetime. the procedure is satisfying

since it is intrinsic to the spacetime of interest, and unambiguous once the counterterm

is specied.

the new prescription is particularly elegant in the case of asymptotically ads

2

spacetimes [9].

in these cases the structure of the divergences is such that they

can be fully removed by adding a nite polynomial in the boundary curvature and its

derivatives. moreover, the counterterm method is precisely analogous to the standard

removal of divergences in quantum eld theory by adding nite polynomials in the

elds; indeed, the ads/cft correspondence [10] asserts that they are the very same.

the equivalence between the gravitational action and that of a cft on the boundary

is illustrated by the agreement between trace anomalies [11, 12, 13, 14] and casimir

energies [9, 15] obtained from the two descriptions (see [16] for a dierent appearance

of divergences in the ads/cft correspondence).

counterterms for low dimensional ads spacetimes were obtained in [9, 17]. our

focus in the rst half of this paper is to develop an algorithm for generating counter-

terms for arbitrary dimensions. we begin by analyzing the structure of divergences

in more detail. an important tool is the interplay between the bulk and boundary

geometries, as embodied in the gauss-codazzi equations. this formulation of the

problem leads to an iterative process that generates the counterterms as an expansion

in the radius of the anti-de sitter space, denoted by :

s =

1


[ s(0) + 2 s(1) +   ]

(1)

the coecients s(n) are increasingly complicated polynomials of the boundary cur-

vature tensor and its derivatives. the iterative process is manifestly covariant and

quite ecient; we compute the four leading orders explicitly, and show that our al-

gorithm denes a series of local counterterms to all orders. the trace anomalies of

the boundary theory play a prominent role in the discussion; indeed, there is a close

connection to the anomaly computation of [11].

crucial to the success of the counterterm prescription is that the divergences are

universal, so that a single choice of counterterms suces to render nite the action

of all asymptotically ads solutions1. the nite terms are non-universal, though, and

so the counterterm subtraction leaves a nite remainder in general. we use the ads-

schwarzschild spacetimes to illustrate these properties of the action. an important

1the action will sometimes have logarithmic divergences which remain uncancelled by the coun-

terterms. however, these divergences are well understood physically as arising from the trace

anomaly.

3

feature of the counterterm prescription is that it provides unambiguous results even

for nontrivial boundary topologies, such as taub-nut-ads [18, 17].

it is of obvious interest to apply the counterterm method to spacetimes that

are asymptotically at, rather than asymptotically ads. one approach is to try to

determine these by solving the at space versions of the gauss-codazzi equations.

however, the resulting equation is highly non-linear and we have had no progress with

this strategy. an alternative strategy is to dene at space as the limit where the ads
curvature   . but to take the limit one rst has to determine the counterterms to
all orders in , which seems prohibitively dicult. we pursue a third approach, which

can be understood as a renement of the reference spacetime prescription. we derive

the action of a particular spacetime which asymptotes to the solutions of interest,

and write the result in terms of intrinsic invariants of the boundary. the resulting

counterterm action is then expected to share the divergences of spacetimes which look

suciently like the chosen spacetime near innity. unlike in the standard reference

spacetime prescription, once we have obtained the counterterm we can forget about

the reference spacetime altogether.

recently lau [19] and mann [18] proposed the remarkably simple counterterm for

spaces that are asymptotically ads4:

8g s = 

2

 z d3x r1 +

2
2

r ,

(2)

which has a smooth limit as   . mann further showed that, in many explicit ex-
amples, this removes all divergences and gives a nite part that agrees with the refer-

ence spacetime procedure [18, 20]. by following the strategy of the previous paragraph

we derive the d-dimensional generalization of the lau-mann formula. however, the

assumptions of the derivation are quite strong, and there are simple examples where

divergences are not removed. we give a more general counterterm that removes the

divergences for asymptotically at space in more cases, though not in general. our

examples suggest that a counterterm capable of removing the divergences from arbi-

trary asymptotically at spacetimes would be quite complicated. however, we stress

that such an expression is not needed under normal circumstances  the countert-

erms we dene provide well dened actions for the most common class of spacetimes.

a more general result would only be needed if one wished to consider spacetimes

4

which deviate strongly from these.

all of the counterterms that we derive will be coordinate invariant, intrinsic to the

boundary, and local. the property of locality is not a priori mandatory, since adding

non-local intrinsic counterterms would not disturb the equations of motion and so

cannot be excluded on such grounds. as we will describe below, for asymptotically

ads spaces the divergences are always local polynomials in the boundary elds and

their derivatives, as was to be expected given the ads/cft correspondence. in the

case of asymptotically at spaces it is less clear what to expect, since we do not know

whether the putative holographically dual theories will have only local divergences.

still, in the simple asymptotically at examples we consider below, it suces to use

local countertems only in order to remove the divergences.

the at space limit of ads space has recently been discussed in the context of the

complete, dynamical string theory [21, 22]. it was argued that, in the appropriate

limit, the ads/cft correspondence constitutes a suitable starting point for non-

perturbative m-theory in at space. the divergences in the gravitational action which

we study give nontrivial information concerning a possible holographic description of

at space. the correct understanding of the at space counterterm may ultimately

be interlinked with these far-reaching perspectives.

the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2 we develop our algorithm for

generating ads counterterms, and give examples. we turn to at space in section

3, and give two examples of counterterms. the counterterms are seen to lead to the

standard results for the actions of black hole spacetimes, provided that appropriate

coordinates are chosen. we show in an example how more general coordinates may

lead to ambiguities, whose nature we explain.

5

2 counterterms and the gauss-codazzi equation

we write the standard action for the gravitational eld as 2:

s =

1

16gzm

dd+1xg(cid:18)r +

d(d  1)

2

(cid:19) 

1

8gzm

ddx  .

(3)

variation of this action with respect to the geometry of the boundary m gives the

energy-momentum tensor [3]:

ab = ab  ab ,

(4)

where ab is the metric of the boundary. concrete computations show that in most

spacetimes both the action integral (3) and the energy-momentum tensor (4) actually

diverge as the boundary m is taken to innity. we therefore think of these as the

unrenormalized quantities.

the divergences must be cancelled in order to achieve physically meaningful ex-

pressions; i.e. some counterterm action:

s =

1

8gz ddx l ,

(5)

must be added, along with the corresponding counterterm energy-momentum tensor:

ab =

2





ab z ddx l .

(6)

the counterterms by denition contain the divergent part of the corresponding un-

renormalized quantities, but nite terms may depend on the details of the renormal-

ization.

now, recall that the gibbons-hawking boundary term in (3) has been determined

precisely such that the combined action satises a well-dened variational principle,

giving the correct bulk equation of motion. the counterterm will ruin this property

unless it is a function of the boundary geometry only. additionally, suppose the

counterterm is an analytical function of the boundary geometry, and expand it as a

power series in the metric and its derivatives. dimensional analysis shows that in

where the antisymmetrization is dened with strength one, i.e.

2this xes our conventions for the riemann curvature to be r

,
2 (  ). also r =
. with these conventions spheres have a positive scalar curvature. the cosmological constant

r
is written as  = d(d  1)/22; in this notation pure adsd+1 has radius .

[] = 1

6

adsd+1 only terms of order n < d/2 contribute to the divergent part of the action.

(by terms of order n we mean terms containing 2n derivatives.) therefore one may

truncate the series at this order and obtain a nite polynomial [9]. this agrees

with the expectations from the interpretation of the divergences in terms of a dual

boundary theory that obeys the usual axioms of quantum eld theory, including

locality.

in most of this paper we will treat the dimension d as a free parameter

which can be made very large and so think of the counterterm as a d-dependent

power series with an arbitrarily high number of terms. of course, when restricting

the attention to a particular value of d, the general result should be truncated.

2.1 the counterterm generating algorithm

the structure of divergences is tightly constrained by the gauss-codazzi equations.
these are covariant expressions of the bulk einstein tensor g = r  1
2gr in
terms of the boundary einstein tensor gab() (which only depends on the induced

metric ab) and the extrinsic curvature ab (which characterizes the embedding of the

boundary surface into the bulk geometry). after using (4) they read [1]:

gab = gab() + nab 

gan = bba ,
2(cid:18) 1
d  1

g nn =

1

d  1  cdcd(cid:19) +

1
2

ab(cid:18) 2
2  abab  r()(cid:19) ,

1

d  1

ab ,

(7)

(8)

(9)

where n is an outward pointing unit vector normal to the boundary. we will always

consider solutions of the bulk equations of motion so:

d(d  1)

2

gab =

2
gan = 0 ,

2

g nn =

d(d  1)

2

ab ,

,

(10)

determines the left hand side of the gauss-codazzi equations.

in principle, one could solve the gauss-codazzi equations (7)-(9) for the unrenor-
malized energy-momentum tensor ab, and then identify its divergent part with  ab.
however, this strategy is rather complicated due to the presence of the normal deriva-

tives in (7). the appearance of these normal derivatives expresses the intuitive fact

7

that, to determine the solution throughout, both the boundary values and their

derivatives are needed. however, the counterterm should be determined indepen-

dently of data that is extrinsic to the boundary, such as the normal derivative.

now, there exists a set of coordinates for which the bulk einstein equations in

adsd+1 (which are equivalent to the gauss-codazzi equations) can be solved in a

perturbative fashion [23]. explicit computations in this coordinate system show that

the divergent part of the normal derivatives can be expressed in terms of the intrinsic

boundary data [23]. we implement this observation covariantly, as follows. we impose

the constraint equation (9):

1

d  1

2  ab ab =

d(d  1)

2

+ r ,

(11)

and further insist that the counterterm energy-momentum tensor must derive from a

counterterm action, which is itself intrinsic to the boundary:

ab =

2





ab z ddx l .

(12)

as we will show, the conditions (11) and (12) fully determine the counterterm. the

form of (12) ensures that the counterterm energy-momentum is conserved, which in

turn implies (8). it is important to stress that the remaining gauss-codazzi equations

(7) are also satised: they can be viewed as expressions for the normal derivatives

specied implicitly in our construction. we note that the normal derivatives thus

determined do not in general vanish.

there is another implicit denition of the normal derivative which is important

in the ads/cft correspondence: this is the requirement of regularity in the bulk

of spacetime [24]. for euclidean adsd+1 with a boundary suciently close to the
round sphere sd it is known that, for given intrinsic boundary data, there exists a

unique solution to the gauss-codazzi equations which is regular in the interior of

ads [25]. this is not in general the solution we consider. that our solution may

become singular when expanded to all orders is of no concern because, for a specic

value of the boundary dimension d, we always truncate to a nite number of terms.

we are now prepared to describe an algorithm that determines the counterterm

as an expansion in the parameter . the leading order term scale as 1 and terms
at a given order 2n1 with n  0 are denoted by (n)
ab and l(n). the starting point

8

is to note that the curvature term in (11) can be neglected to the leading order in

, so that the metric is the only tensor characterizing the boundary geometry to the
leading order. the (0)

ab are therefore proportional to the metric, with the overall

numerical factor determined by (11). this gives:
d  1

ab .

(0)
ab = 



(13)

the sign was determined using positivity conditions on the energy-momentum tensor.
higher order counterterms are now given by induction. assuming that ab is

known up to and including order n  1, the following three steps determine (n)
ab :

insert the known terms in (11); the resulting expression is a linear equation

step 1:
with the trace (n) as the only unknown.

step 2: with the trace (n) in hand, integrate (12) and nd l(n). this step is
purely algebraic, as discussed in the following subsection.

step 3: finally, take the functional derivative of l(n) with respect to ab, and so
nd the full tensor (n)
ab

from (12).

the fact that (0)
ab

is proportional to the metric ab is crucial to make step 1
possible. we stress that higher orders of ab in general will depend also on other
tensor structures.

2.2 some comments on weyl rescalings

the integration in step 2 is interesting and deserves comment. it is related to the

behavior of the various terms under the local weyl variations which transform the

metric as:

w ab = ab ,

(14)

where  is an arbitrary function. consider the counterterm action at the nth order

and note that dimensional analysis gives the behavior under a global weyl rescaling.

the result of a local weyl variation can therefore be written in the form:

w z ddx l(n) =z ddx  (cid:18)d  2n

2

l(n) + ax a(n)(cid:19) ,

(15)

9

where x a(n) is some unspecied expression (involving 2n + 1 derivatives).3 however,

it follows from (12) that:

so:

w z ddx l(n) =

1

2z ddx  (n) ,

(d  2n) l(n) = (n) ,

(16)

(17)

up to a total derivative term. now, recall that counterterm lagrangians are in fact

only dened up to total derivatives; a total derivative term can be added without

changing the action. we can therefore freely choose a scheme where (17) is exact,

without need for total derivatives. the practical signicance of this identity is that

it renders the integration in step 2 almost trivial. we also note that:

w z ddx (n) =

d  2n

2

z ddx  (n) ,

(18)

so that  (n) transforms as a conformal density with weyl weight 1

to total derivatives [26, 27]. this constrains the form of the counterterms.

2(d  2n), up

in even dimensions it is clear that (17) prevents (d/2) from being obtained as the

variation of any local action. this is the origin of trace anomalies. for a given even
dimension d the trace (d/2) is therefore identied with the trace anomaly of the dual

boundary theory. this result for the anomaly agrees with that of [11], as may be

veried by looking at the explicit expressions given below.

2.3 explicit computations of counterterms

at this point we evaluate the counterterms explicitly, to the rst few orders.

the leading order was given in (13). for completeness we give its trace and the

corresponding counterterm, computed using (17):

(19)
3it is important that the lagrangian l(n) is assumed to be local, otherwise (15) need not be true.
for example, w r ddx r 1

(25)

the most laborious step is to nd the full energy momentum-tensor from the counter-

term. accordingly, we have resisted carrying out this computation to the fourth order.

the rst three orders of (23) agree with the results previously deduced from

explicit examples [9, 17]. all four terms may be obtained from the results in [11] (see

in particular the appendix of the second reference.)

11

2.4 explicit examples in ads

we now consider a few simple examples that illustrate the general results.

2.4.1 euclidean adsd+1 with a sd boundary

consider pure adsd+1 with the metric:

ds2 =

dr2

1 + r2/2 + r2d2
d .

(26)

using the denition (4) of the unrenormalized energy-momentum tensor, one can

straightforwardly compute the density:

(27)

2

it clearly diverges for r0  , so one needs to add counterterms in order to cancel
the terms of order n < d/2. the ricci scalar on the boundary is expressed in terms

of the position r0 of the boundary through:

r =

d(d  1)

r2
0

.

(28)

inserting this in the formula for the counterterm  given in (23), and exploiting that

the space is maximally symmetric, we nd terms that are precisely equal to (27), with

the opposite sign. thus the divergences cancel.

however, as emphasized above, the counterterm (23) should be truncated so that

only the divergences cancel. for even dimension this implies that the nite term in

(27) is not subtracted. this residual term is the anomaly. that there is a genuine

obstruction that precludes the cancellation of this term is seen by inspecting the

would-be counterterm action (24) at order d = n/2. after evaluation on sd this term
remains ill-dened due to the 1/(d  2n) factor.

for odd-dimensional boundaries there are no anomalies and the renormalized

energy-momentum tensor vanishes. however, this does not imply that the renor-

malized action vanishes. to see this, consider the contribution to the action from

the bulk part of (3). this term has the form of a radial integral r r0

0 dr leading to

12

a term at r = r0, which is in fact cancelled by the counterterms, but also a term

at r = 0 which does not get subtracted o. interestingly, the resulting uncancelled
action implies negative entropy for the case of ads4 with an s3 boundary [17].

2.4.2 the ads-schwarzschild solution

next, we consider the ads-schwarzschild metric:

ds2 = (cid:18)1 +

which for large values of r asymptotes to a pure adsd+1 solution with a r  sd1
boundary. the corresponding unrenormalized energy-momentum tensor (4) can be

expanded as:

it is very important that the divergent terms depend on the boundary position

r0 only. this ensures that these terms are intrinsic to the boundary, as they should

be. (that the divergent terms are intrinsic can be made manifest by expressing r0
in terms of the ricci scalar r, using r = (d  1)(d  2)/r2
0.) the mass parameter
 is an extrinsic quantity from the boundary point of view, so it is important that

the -dependence appears only at the nite level. because of its extrinsic nature, the

-dependence can never be subtracted o.

generically (17) forces a 1/(d 2n) divergence in the counterterm action at order
n = d/2, rendering the corresponding subtraction impossible. the present example is
special because the trace  contains a (d  2n) factor at each order n so that a nite

13

counterterm at order n = d/2 is viable. the physical signicance of this possibility is

that we can choose to include the order d/2 counterterm as well, such that the entire

-independent part of the energy-momentum tensor is cancelled. it was shown in [9]

that the -independent nite part of the energy-momentum tensor can be identied

with the casimir energy in the dual conformal eld theory. the ability to cancel

this part of the energy-momentum tensor is equivalent to the option of choosing a
renormalization scheme where the casimir energy of r  sd1 is set to zero.

3 counterterms for asymptotically flat space

we now turn to dening the gravitational action in asymptotically at space (afs).

at rst glance, afs may seem like just a special case of ads, since it can be obtained
by taking the limit   . this analogy leads us to consider (11), which in the limit
reads:

1

d  1

2  ab ab = r ,

(31)

and we should further impose (12) on the solution. the problem is now nonlinear and

does not appear to allow a perturbative expansion; a direct computation is therefore
impractical. we might instead try to apply the limit    to our perturbative
expansion of the counterterm action. however, the large  limit can only be taken after

summing the innite series, which is clearly a dicult task. it is also doubtful whether

the sum exists, for the following reasons: as we mentioned before, the counterterm

action (24) implicitly denes a bulk solution which in general need not be regular.

therefore, if the sum did exist, it would generically assign some nite action to

singular solutions, which seems unphysical. most glaringly, for even d the coecients

of individual terms diverge.

we will take an alternative approach to dene the afs counterterms. we will start

with some particular solution, work out its action, and then express the result in terms

of intrinsic invariants of the boundary. the counterterm action is then dened as

minus this expression. to the extent that divergences are universal, this counterterm

action will remove the divergences of solutions which asymptote to the particular

solution used in the construction. the counterterm is not uniquely dened, since

choosing dierent solutions or dierent curvature invariants will yield inequivalent

14

results. as we will discuss, this does not appear to be a drawback of the procedure.

an added benet is that this method exhibits the relation between the counterterm

method and the reference spacetime approach clearly.

3.1 a counterterm for afs

we rst consider the most common class of metrics, those having boundary topology
sd1  r.4 in this case we can work out a simple closed form counterterm for ads
with nite , and then take the at space limit   . to do so we consider adsd+1
in global coordinates:

ds2 = (1 + r2/2)dt2 +

dr2

1 + r2/2 + r2d2

d1 .

(32)

to evaluate the gravitational action (3) we use that r2 = 2d/2 for pure adsd+1,
and also the general expression:

sgh = 

1

8gz ddx  =

1

8gz ddx


n

 ,

where n is the unit normal to the boundary. then the action becomes:

sbulk + sgh =

8gz ddx  q1 + 2/r2
d  1

0 .

to express this in terms of intrinsic invariants we use:

r =

(d  1)(d  2)

r2
0

,

(33)

(34)

(35)

for a d  1 sphere of radius r0. this leads to the denition:

sa = (sbulk + sgh) = 

d  1

8gz ddx  s1 +

2r

(d  1)(d  2)

.

(36)

by denition, sa will assign vanishing total action to ads in global coordinates. we

further expect it to give nite action for solutions which asymptote to (32). in the

at space limit we nd:

4the case of d = 2 requires special considerations, so we assume d > 2. it is interesting that the

la = r d  1
d  2

r .

(37)

d = 2 case is exactly solvable for all boundary geometries.

15

it is instructive to compare (36) with the power series (24). choosing coordinates

(a,  ) on sd1  r we have:
1

rabc d =

(gacgb d  ga dgbc)r , rab =
as well as rab = r  = 0. the power series (24) becomes:

(d  1)(d  2)

1

d  1

gabr ,

(38)

3

5

d  1

 

1

r +

2(d  2)

8(d  1)(d  2)2 r2 

l = 
this precisely corresponds to the expansion of sa in (36). so it appears that for
the sd1  r class of boundary geometries we have summed the series (24). note
that the potentially divergent factors of 1/(d  4), 1/(d 6), . . . were cancelled in the
process, leading to a well dened counterterm for arbitrary d > 2. since (38) only

16(d  1)2(d  2)3 r3 +    . (39)

relies on sd1 being a maximally symmetric space, this computation further indicates

that (36) also cancels the divergences when sd1 is replaced by a space with constant

negative curvature.

for d = 3 the counterterm (36) is closely related to an expression obtained by

lau through dierent means [19]. it agrees precisely with the counterterm used by

mann [20].

indeed, the present reasoning provides a simple derivation of manns

proposal, and its generalization to d dimensions.

3.2 counterterms and black hole thermodynamics

before continuing the main argument we pause to derive a constraint on the countert-

erms from smarrs formula, and also comment on the (absent) eect of counterterms

on the black hole entropy. a useful reference for the formulas in this section is [28].

upon continuation to imaginary time, the action of a euclidean black hole solution

represents the thermodynamic free energy of the system:

s = m  jj  sent,

(40)

where we denote entropy by sent, and inverse temperature  or equivalently, the

periodicity of imaginary time  by . j represents the angular momentum of the

horizon and j is its conjugate potential. given s as a function of  and j , the

mass and angular momentum follow from:

m =

s


,

j = 

s
j

.

16

(41)

the bekenstein-hawking formula sent = a/4g and the generalized smarr formula:

(d  2)m = (d  1)(jj +

a
4g

) ,

give the simple expression for the action:

s =

m
d  1

.

(42)

(43)

a notable point is that j and j do not appear explicitly in the result, but only

via . in sec. 3.4 we will compute the action for a general rotating solution and see

explicitly that it only receives contributions from the leading long-range part of the

metric, which is equivalent to that of a spherically symmetric solution.

as a simple example, we work out the action of the d + 1 dimensional euclidean

schwarzschild solution using the counterterm action (37):

ds2 =(cid:16)1 



rd2(cid:17) d 2 +

where  is related to the adm mass by:

+ r2d2

d1 ,

dr2

(cid:0)1  
rd2(cid:1)

we nd (after rotating to euclidean time):

 =

16gm
(d  1)d1

.

(44)

(45)

s = sgh + sa =  lim

r0

=

d1
16g

=

,

in agreement with (43).

  (d  1)rd2

(cid:21)

(46)

as we have discussed and will see again explicitly, one may sometimes have a

choice between several counterterm actions which all subtract o the innities but

lead to dierent nite results. it is important to stress that in the case of black holes

these choices aect only the denition of energy and not the entropy; the latter is

always given by the bekenstein-hawking formula. this can be seen as follows [29]

(for simplicity we consider the spherically symmetric case). consider restricting the
imaginary time integration region in (46) to some duration  . let w be the wedge
shaped region in the r   plane given by restricting  to the range  . the tip
of the wedge lies at the horizon. to compute the action of w we need to include

17

a boundary term at the tip. here only the gibbons-hawking term can contribute,

since the vanishing of g  at the horizon causes intrinsic invariants to vanish upon

integration. now, from the hamilton-jacobi equation it follows that the action of a

static ( independent) solution obeys:

s =  m .

(47)

this equation denes the mass of the spacetime, and so is independent of choice

of counterterms at innity, although the actual value of m can be. next, consider

evaluating the action for the full euclidean black hole manifold. we then set  = ,

and omit the gibbons-hawking term at the horizon, since the only boundary is at

r = r0. therefore the action is:

s = m  shor
gh .

(48)

finally, a simple computation yields that shor

gh = sent = a/4g. we have thus estab-
lished that the entropy is insensitive to the addition of boundary terms at innity.

the entropy is in this sense renormalization scheme independent.

3.3 more divergences and another counterterm for afs

the counterterm sa was designed to remove divergences for boundaries of the form
sd1  r, so there is no guarantee that it will continue to do so for other boundary
topologies. as a simple example, take at euclidean space in spherical coordinates:

ds2 = dr2 + r2d2

d .

then:

sgh =

dd
8g

rd1
0

,

sa = 

8g r d
(d  1)d
d  2

(49)

(50)

rd1
0

.

the sum of the two terms is not nite as the boundary is taken to innity r0  ; so
the divergences are not removed by sa. note that this problem persists in spacetimes

with four bulk dimensions, i.e. d = 3.

by generalizing the derivation that led to sa we can derive a counterterm which

will remove divergences for a larger class of spacetimes, including the example just
given. write at d + 1 dimensional space in a form with boundary sn  rdn:

ds2 = (dt2 + dx2

1 +    + dx2

d1n) + dr2 + r2d2
n.

(51)

18

the action is:

1

8gz ddx 

n
r0

sgh =

(52)
where  = rn
0gn . we wish to write a counterterm that will remove the divergence
at large r0 for arbitrary n. to do so it is necessary to use more invariants than just
r. we take also rr, and use that for sn  rdn:

,

r =

n(n  1)

r2
0

, rr = r2/n .

(53)

then we arrive at:

sb = sgh = 

1

8gz ddx 

.

(54)

r3/2

pr2  rr

this counterterm reverts to sa in the special case of n = d  1 for which rr =
r2/(d  1). but sb is more general than sa since it will remove divergences from
metrics that are asymptotic to any of (51).

3.4 discussion

in cases for which both sa and sb remove divergences one can ask whether they will

also agree on the nite part. an interesting feature is that the answer depends on

the coordinates used to describe a given spacetime  by using a preferred class of

coordinates the two counterterms will agree in the main cases of interest.

3.4.1 counterterms and the adm prescription

it is important to verify that under suitable conditions we obtain results for the mass

and angular momentum which agree with the standard adm denitions. to show

this, we use that any afs can be cast in the form:



ds2 = (cid:18)1 
+ (cid:20)(cid:18)1 +

rd2 + o(cid:18) 1
rd2 + o(cid:18) 1

rd1(cid:19)(cid:19) dt2 (cid:18)aijxi
rd1(cid:19)(cid:19) ij +

rd + o(cid:18) 1
rd2 + o(cid:18) 1

rd(cid:19)(cid:19) dxjdt
rd1(cid:19)(cid:21) dxidxj.

eij



(55)

the boundary is taken to be at xed r2

0 = xixi. aij is proportional to the angular
momentum of the spacetime, and the symmetric, traceless tensor eij represents grav-

itational radiation. we will restrict attention to isolated systems, for which  and

aij are constants; the time dependent case requires a more detailed analysis.

19

now, the important point is that upon evaluating the action we nd that the

angular momentum and gravitational radiation terms in the metric make no contri-
bution as r0  . first note that the r0 dependence is such that only terms in the
action linear in aij or eij can potentially contribute. but aij cannot appear linearly

in the action due to time reversal symmetry. and eij can only appear in the rotation-
ally invariant combinations eii, eijxixj (sum on i, j); but for eij traceless, the former

vanishes identically, while the latter vanishes upon integration over the sphere. there-

fore, in the action, only the  dependent terms survive, and the calculation eectively
reduces to that for the schwarzschild metric, with boundary sd1  r. however, we
already know from our previous computation (46) that the counterterms sa and sb

agree for boundaries of this form, and indeed by direct calculation we nd:

s = sgh + sa = sgh + sb = 

d1
16g

.

(56)

this is the correct result, as we discussed in the derivation of (46). demanding

regularity of the euclidean black hole metric xes the relation between  and .

then, by dierentiating the action with respect to  we can read o the mass of the

solutions. in so doing, we nd agreement with the adm denition (45).

it is satisfying that our counterterms reproduce the adm denitions for the gen-

eral class of metrics (55), since these follow from quite general considerations. for

instance, the adm mass is the unique (up to an overall constant) quantity which is

conserved, transforms as the time component of a lorentz vector, and is additive for

distant subsystems. if one is willing to relax one or more of these conditions then

other results are possible, and we will see an explicit example of this in the following

subsection.

3.4.2 an example: spheroidal coordinates

to get agreement between sa, sb, and the standard result for the action (56) it was

important to use the preferred coordinates (55). this fact is illustrated by considering

at space in non-standard coordinates. we know that both counterterms assign zero

action to at space in the form:

ds2 = dt2 + dr2 + r2d2

d1 .

(57)

20

now instead use spheroidal coordinates:

ds2 = dt2 +

r2 + a2 cos2 

r2 + a2

dr2 +(r2 +a2 cos2 )d2 +sin2 (r2 +a2)d2 +r2 cos2 d2

d3

(58)

this is in fact the form of the metric one nds upon setting the mass parameter to

zero in the d-dimensional generalization of the kerr metric written in boyer-lindquist

coordinates [28]. in these coordinates, the action (33) yields:

sgh =

1

8gz ddx (cid:20)d  1 + (d  3)

a2
r2
0

+

a2 sin2 

0 + a2 cos2 (cid:21) rd2

0

r2

(59)
where the measure is ddx = dtdddd3. the expression in the square bracket forms

sin  cosd3 gd3

a kernel with the expansion:

k = (d  1) +(cid:0)d  2  cos2 (cid:1)

a2
0  (cos2   cos4 )
r2

a4
r4
0

+    .

(60)

after computing the curvature tensors of the boundary geometry the counterterm

(37) can be written as:

sa = 

d  1
8g z ddx
(d  3)(d  4)
(d  1)(d  2)
corresponding to the expansion:

+

(r2 + a2)1/2

(r2 + a2 cos2 )1/2 (cid:20)1 +

(d  3)
(d  1)

+   

in the same normalization as (60). the general expression for the alternative coun-

terterm (54) is quite lengthy, so we give just the expansion:

a2
k b = (d  1)  (d  2  cos2 )
r2

13  22d + 18d2  7d3 + d4

(63)

+   

these expressions show that both counterterms correctly capture the divergences to
the rst two leading orders. the renormalized action therefore vanishes as r0  

21

for d < 6, it is nite for d = 6, and for d > 6 the divergences of at space in spheroidal

coordinates are not cancelled by either counterterm. after integration over  we nd

that, for d = 6, the nite action assigned to at space is nonvanishing, but dierent

for the two counterterms.

on a technical level, note that the metrics (57), (58) are equivalent to leading
order for large r, with both boundaries asymptoting to sd1  r. it is the subleading
a dependent terms which lead to the nite terms in the action.

this discussion was for at space in spheroidal coordinates. it is straightforward

to compute the expression analogous to (59) for the kerr black hole in d dimen-

sions [28]. this yields a structure of divergences that departs from the at space

expression (60) only by terms of order a4/r4

0 and higher. the renormalized action is
therefore nite for d < 6, with the expected value. for d = 6 the action is nite and

nonvanishing, but dierent for the two counterterms; and for d > 6 the divergences

are not cancelled. this indicates that for d > 6 the spheroidal boundary deviates
too strongly from the round sphere (for which both counterterms sa and sb were

designed). presumably there exists another more sophisticated counterterm which

subtracts o all divergences for d > 6 spheroidal boundaries as well. we have not

tried to construct such a counterterm.

3.4.3 concluding remarks

the fact that at space in spheroidal coordinates is assigned a nonzero action in d = 6

is at rst surprising, but becomes less so when we recall the analogous situation in

ads. there we know that the simplest choice of counterterms assign vanishing action

to adsd+1 in poincare coordinates, but nite action to adsd+1 in global coordinates

for d even. this fact has a nice interpretation in terms of the ads/cft correspon-
dence: the boundary of ads in global coordinates is sd1  r, upon which the cft
can have a nonzero action due to the casimir eect. the ability of the counterterm

prescription to assign nonzero action to ads in various coordinates is crucial to the

consistency of the ads/cft correspondence. although we do not currently have ac-

cess to a holographic description of afs, we should not be surprised that the action

behaves in a way analogous to ads.

since sa and sb can lead to dierent nite terms in the action, one can ask

22

whether this implies that one, both, or neither of them is in some sense correct.

we believe that both are valid expressions for the action, and should be thought of

as the results in dierent renormalization schemes. the important criterion is that
the counterterm s can be written in terms of intrinsic invariants of the boundary,
and that it removes the divergences of the action. in this sense, sa and sb are both
valid for boundaries of topology sd1  r, while only sb is valid for the more general
case of sn  rdn. future work may identify the most general counterterm that
subtracts the divergences of any regularization of afs. this would be interesting for

several purposes, including the general understanding of the asymptotic symmetry

group (the spi group). however, from a practical point of view, this development is

unnecessary: our work shows that, when the divergences of the action are cancelled

for some counterterm, the nite part has necessarily been correctly identied.
