abstract

we study the embedding of d(8-p)-branes in the background geometry of parallel
dp-branes for p  6. the d(8-p)-brane is extended along the directions orthogonal to the
dp-branes of the background. the d(8-p)-brane conguration is determined by its dirac-
born-infeld plus wess-zumino-witten action. we nd a bps condition which solves the
equation of motion. the analytical solution of the bps equation for the near-horizon and
asymptotically at geometries is given. the embeddings we obtain represent branes joined
by tubes. by analyzing the energy of these tubes we conclude that they can be regarded as
bundles of fundamental strings. our solution provides an explicit realization of the hanany-
witten eect. when p = 6 the solution of the bps equation must be considered separately
and, in general, the embeddings of the d2-branes do not admit the same interpretation as
in the p < 6 case.

1 introduction

d-branes have been shown to play a fundamental role in the non-perturbative structure of
string theory. originally [1], they were introduced as hypersurfaces in space-time on which
open strings with dirichlet boundary conditions are allowed to end. the extended objects so
dened are charged under the ramond-ramond (rr) sector of the theory and are essential
to understand the duality structure of string theories. moreover, the low energy physics of
d-branes can be described by supersymmetric gauge theory and, actually, super yang-mills
theory arises as a low energy description of parallel d-branes.

d-branes also appear as solutions of the supergravity eective action of string theory [2].
these solutions are extended generalizations of the schwarzschild geometry which describe
the gravitational eld created by an object carrying ramond-ramond charge. this gravita-
tional eld acts on the dimensions orthogonal to the d-brane worldvolume which, from the
point of view of the gauge theory, can be regarded as extra dimensions.

the interplay between gauge theory and gravity is on the basis of the maldacena conjec-
ture [3]. indeed, maldacena has argued that there is a remarkable duality between classical
supergravity in the near-horizon region and the large n t hooft limit of the su(n) yang-
mills theory. in particular, the near-horizon geometry of parallel d3-branes is equivalent to
the space ads5  s5, whose boundary can be identied with four-dimensional minkowsky
space-time. in this case one gets the so-called ads/cf t correspondence between type iib
superstrings on ads5s5 and n = 4 non-abelian super yang-mills theory in four dimensions
[4, 5, 6]. within this context, one can compute wilson loop expectation values by consider-
ing a fundamental open string placed on the interior of the ads5 space and having its ends
on the boundary [7]. this formalism has been used to extract quark potentials both in the
supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric theory. moreover, witten [8] has proposed a way
to incorporate baryons by means of a d5-brane wrapped on the s5, from which fundamental
strings that end on the d3-branes emanate [9, 10].

in ref. [11], the problem of a d5-brane moving under the inuence of a d3-brane back-
ground was considered. the d5-brane dynamics is governed by an action which is the sum
of a dirac-born-infeld and a wess-zumino term. the equations of motion of the static
d5-brane are solved if one assumes that the elds satisfy a certain rst-order bps dier-
ential equation that was found previously by imamura [12]. this bps condition can be
integrated exactly in the near-horizon region of the background d3-brane geometry and the
solutions are spikes of the d5-brane worldvolume which can be interpreted as bundles of
fundamental strings ending on the d3-branes. actually, these kinds of spikes are a general
characteristic of the dirac-born-infeld non-linear gauge theory and can be used to describe
strings attached to branes [13, 14].

the bps condition for the full asymptotically at d3-brane metric was analyzed nu-
merically in ref.
[11]. as a result of this study one gets a precise description of the string
creation process which takes place when two d-branes cross each other, i.e. of the so-called
hanany-witten eect [15, 16]. these results were generalized in ref.
[17] to the case of
baryons in conning gauge theories. moreover, in ref. [18] the bps dierential equation was
obtained as a condition which must be fullled in order to saturate a lower bound on the
energy.

in this paper we shall study the worldvolume dynamics of a d(8-p)-brane moving un-
der the action of the gravitational and ramond-ramond elds of a stack of background
dp-branes for p  6. the d(8-p)-brane is extended along the directions orthogonal to the
worldvolume of the background dp-branes. for p = 3 this system is the one analyzed in ref.
[11]. by using the method of ref.
[18], we will nd a bps rst-order dierential equation
whose solutions also verify the equation of motion. remarkably, we will be able to integrate
analytically this bps equation both in the near-horizon and asymptotically at metrics.
for p  5 the solutions we will nd are similar to the ones described in ref.
[11], i.e. the
d(8-p)-brane worldvolume has spikes which can be interpreted as ux tubes made up of
fundamental strings. our analytical solution will allow us to give a detailed description of
the shape of these tubes, their energy and of the process of string creation from d-brane
worldvolumes.

the organization of this paper is the following. in section 2 we formulate our problem.
the bps dierential equation is obtained in section 3. in section 4 this bps condition is
integrated for p  5 in the near-horizon region. the p = 6 system requires a special treat-
ment, which is discussed in section 5. the solution of the bps equation for the full dp-brane
geometry is obtained in section 6. the detailed analysis of this solution is performed in ap-
pendix a. finally, in section 7, we summarize our results and point out some directions for
future work.

2 worldvolume dynamics

the ten-dimensional metric (in the string frame) corresponding to a stack of n coincident
extremal dp-branes in type ii superstring theory is [2]:

ds2 = h hp(r)i 1

2 (dt2 + dx2

k ) + h hp(r)i

1

2 ( dr2 + r2 d2

8p ) .

(2.1)

in eq. (2.1) xk are p-dimensional cartesian coordinates along the branes, r is a radial coordi-
nate parametrizing the distance to the branes and d2
8p is the line element of an unit 8  p
sphere. the harmonic function hp(r) appearing in eq. (2.1) is given by:

hp(r) = a + (cid:16) r

r (cid:17)7p

,

(2.2)

where a = 0, 1 and the radius r can be written in terms of the number n of branes, the
regge slope   and the string coupling constant gs as follows:

r7p = n gs 25p 

5p

2 (   )

7p

2 (cid:16) 7  p
2 (cid:17) .

(2.3)

we have chosen our conventions in such a way that the tension of the fundamental string tf
is:

tf =

1
2  .

(2.4)

the value a = 1 in eq. (2.2) corresponds to the full geometry of the stack of dp-branes.
actually, in order to have an asymptotically at space-time, we shall restrict ourselves to

2

the case p < 7. taking a = 0 in the harmonic function hp(r) is equivalent to approximate
the dp-brane geometry by the near-horizon metric of the throat region of (2.1).

the dp-brane solution we are considering is also characterized by a dilaton eld (r) and

a ramond-ramond (rr) p + 2-form eld g. the corresponding values are:

e (r) = h hp(r)i

p3

4

,

gt , x1

k

,  , xp
k

, r =

d

dr h hp(r)i1

,

(2.5)

where (r) = (r)   and  is the value of the dilaton eld at innite distance of
the dp-branes (i.e.  = limr (r)). as was pointed out in ref.
[3], in order to trust
this type ii supergravity solution, both the curvature in string units and the dilaton must
be small. this fact introduces restrictions in the values of the radial coordinates for which
the correspondence between the supergravity and gauge theory descriptions is valid (see also
ref. [19]).

let us now consider a d(8-p)-brane embedded in the transverse directions of the stack of
the background dp-branes. the dynamics of this d(8-p)-brane is determined by its action,
which is a sum of a dirac-born-infeld and a wess-zumino term:

s = t8p z d 9p e qdet ( g + f ) + t8p z d 9p a  g ,

(2.6)

where g is the induced metric on the worldvolume of the d(8-p)-brane, a is a worldvolume
abelian gauge eld and f = da its eld strength. in eq. (2.6) g is a (8-p)-form, which is
the pullback of the hodge dual of the background rr (p+2)-form g. notice that this rr
eld acts as a source for the worldvolume gauge eld a. the coecient t8p appearing in
the action (2.6) is the tension of a d(8-p)-brane, which is given by [1]:

t8p = (2)p8 (   )

p9

2 ( gs )1 .

(2.7)

let 1, 2,   , 8p be coordinates which parametrize the s8p transverse sphere. the
worldvolume coordinates  ( = 0 ,    , 8  p ) will be taken as:

 = ( t , 1 ,    , 8p ) .

(2.8)

we shall assume that the s are spherical angles on s8p and that   8p is the polar
angle (0    ). therefore, the s8p line element d2
8p = d2 + ( sin )2 d2

8p can be decomposed as:

d2

7p ,

(2.9)

where d2
7p, which only depends on 1,    , 7p, is the line element of a s7p sphere.
we are going to consider static congurations of the d(8-p)-brane which only depend on the
polar angle . actually, we shall restrict ourselves to the case in which the only non-vanishing
elds are r(), x() and a0(), x being a direction parallel to the background dp-branes. it

3

is straightforward to verify that the action for such congurations can be written as:

s = t t8p 7p z d (sin )7p 
hr7p hp(r)vuutr2 + r  2 +

x  2
hp(r)  f 2

0, + (1)p+1 (7  p) a0 r7pi ,

(2.10)

where the prime denotes derivative with respect to  and t = r dt. in eq. (2.10) 7p is

the volume of the unit (7-p)-sphere, given by:

7p =

.

(2.11)

8p

2 (cid:17)
(cid:16) 8p

it is interesting at this point to remember that we are considering static solutions of the
gauge eld that only depend on . the electric eld for these congurations is:

let us now dene the displacement eld dp as:

e = f0, =  a0 .

.

(2.12)

(2.13)

the extra factors appearing in the denition (2.13) have been included for convenience. the
euler-lagrange equation for a0 implies an equation for dp which is easy to nd, namely:

d
d

dp(  ) = ( 7  p ) r7p ( sin  )7p .

(2.14)

notice that the right-hand side of eq. (2.14) only depends on . therefore (2.14) can be
integrated and, as a result, one can obtain dp as a function of . we shall work out the
explicit form of dp(  ) at the end of this section. at present we only need to use the fact
that dp(  ) satises eq. (2.14). actually, substituting ( 7  p ) r7p ( sin  )7p by  dp in
the wess-zumino term of the action and integrating by parts, one can recast s as:

with u given by:

u = t8p 7p z d

s = t u ,

" (1)p+1 e dp() +
+ (sin )7p r7p hp(r)vuutr2 + r  2 +

4

x  2

hp(r)  e2 # . (2.16)

notice that, as is evident from their relation (2.15), s and u give rise to the same euler-
lagrange equation. actually, since we have eliminated a0 in favor of dp, we can regard u
as the legendre transform of s and, therefore, u can be considered as an energy functional
for the embedding of the d(8-p)-brane in the dp-brane background. the elds e and dp
are related, as is obvious from eq. (2.13). it is not dicult to invert eq. (2.13) and get e in
terms of dp. the result is:

e = (1)p+1vuut

r2 + r  2 + x  2
hp(r)

(dp())2 + [(sin )7p r7p hp(r) ]2 dp() .

(2.17)

using this relation we can eliminate e from the expression of u:

u = t8p 7p z dvuutr2 + r  2 +

x  2

hp(r) q(dp())2 + [(sin )7p r7p hp(r) ]2 .

(2.18)

recall that dp() is a known function of  (see below). therefore eq.
(2.18) gives the
energy functional u in terms of x() and r(). these functions must be solutions of the
euler-lagrange equations obtained from u. from the study of the functional u in several
situations we will determine the shape of the d(8-p)-brane embedding in the background
geometry. let us consider, rst of all, the near-horizon approximation, which is equivalent
to taking a = 0 in the harmonic function (2.2). in this case r7p hp(r) = r7p and u is
given by:

u = t8p 7p z dsr2 + r  2 +

r7p

r7p x  2 q(dp())2 + (sin )2(7p) r2(7p) .

(2.19)

by inspecting eq. (2.19) one easily concludes that u transforms homogeneously under a
simultaneous rescaling of the radial and parallel coordinates of the form:

(r, x)  (  r, 

p5

2 x ) ,

(2.20)

where  is a constant. it follows that the equations of motion derived from u are invariant
under the transformation (2.20). moreover, the homogeneous character of u under the
transformation (2.20) implies the following scaling law:

7p

2

r

5p

2

r

,

x 

(2.21)

where the power of r has been determined by imposing dimensional homogeneity of both
sides of (2.21). eq. (2.21) is precisely the holographic uv/ir relation found in ref.
[20].
according to eq. (2.21), for p < 5, large radial distances (r  ) correspond to small
values of the parallel coordinate x. for p = 5, the distance x is insensitive to changes in
r, whereas, for p = 6, x increases when r grows. the consequences of this relation for the
correspondence between eld theories and near-horizon supergravities have been discussed
in ref. [20] (see also ref. [21]). in our approach we shall see that, indeed, the p = 6 case is

5

special and the embedding of the d2-brane in the d6-brane background geometry has new
characteristics, which must be studied separately.

let us nish this section by giving the expressions of the displacement elds dp. the
-dependence of dp can be obtained by integrating the right-hand side of eq. (2.14). the

where we have parametrized the additive constant of integration by means of a parameter

displacement eld at  =  is given by:

dp() = 2

(cid:16) 8p
(cid:16) 7p

r7p ( 1   ) .

(2.23)

eq. (2.23) allows to give a precise meaning to the parameter  [11]. in fact, as we shall
verify below, there exist solutions for which r   and x  0 when    in a way that
simulates a ux tube attached to the d(8-p)-brane. the tension (i.e. the energy per unit
radial distance) for one of these spikes can be obtained from the expression of u in eq. (2.18).
actually, as    one can check that the terms with r  dominate over the other terms in
the rst square root in eq. (2.18), whereas the second square root can be approximated by
| dp()|. as a result [11], the tension of the spike is t8p 7p | dp()|. using the value of
dp() given in eq. (2.23) and the fact that (see eqs. (2.3), (2.7) and (2.11)):

t8p 7p r7p =

ntf
2

2 (cid:17)
(cid:16) 7p
(cid:16) 8p
2 (cid:17)

,

(2.24)

we conclude that the tension of the  =  spike is (1  ) n tf , where tf is the tension of
the fundamental string written in eq. (2.4). this result implies that we can interpret the

6

 =  tube as a bundle of (1 ) n fundamental strings which, from the gauge theory point
of view, corresponds to a baryon formed by (1  ) n quarks. it is clear that, although in
the classical theory  is a continuous parameter, upon quantization  should be a multiple
of 1/n taking values in the range 0    1.
let us nally point out that there exist other solutions for which r   and x  0
when   0. the asymptotic tension for these solutions is t8p 7p | dp(0)|. the value of
dp() at  = 0 can be obtained from the values given in eq. (2.22). the result is:

dp(0) = 2

2 (cid:17)
(cid:16) 8p
2 (cid:17)
(cid:16) 7p

r7p  .

(2.25)

using again eq. (2.24), one can verify that t8p 7p | dp(0)| =  n tf , which corresponds
to a bundle of  n fundamental strings. this fact provides an interpretation of  for this
second class of solutions.

3 bps conditions

in the remaining of this paper we are going to study solutions of the equations of motion of
the brane probes which are not extended in the directions parallel to the background branes.
this amounts to take x  = 0 (i.e. x() = constant) in our previous equations. from the
expression (2.18) of u we can get the dierential equation which determines r as a function
of . indeed, the euler-lagrange equation derived from u is:

d

q(dp())2 + [(sin )7p r7p hp(r) ]2

.

trying to obtain a solution for such a complicate second-order dierential equation seems,
a priori, hopeless. a possible strategy to solve eq. (3.1) consists of nding a rst integral
for this system. notice that the integrand of u depends explicitly on  (see eq. (2.18))
and, therefore, there is no rst integral associated to the invariance under shifts of  by a
constant. nevertheless, we will be able to nd a rst-order equation such that any function
r() satisfying it is a solution of the equation (3.1). this rst-order condition is much simpler
than the euler-lagrange equation (3.1) and, indeed, we will be able to solve it analytically,

7

both in the near-horizon (a = 0) and asymptotically at (a = 1) geometries. for p = 3 and
a = 0, the rst order equation was found by imamura [12] as a bps [22] condition for the
implementation of supersymmetry in the worldvolume theory of a d5-brane propagating in
a d3 background. this condition was subsequently extended to (p = 3, a = 1) and (p = 4,
a = 0) in refs. [11] and [17] respectively. in order to generalize these results, we shall follow
here the approach of ref.
[23]), where the bps equation was found by
requiring the saturation of a certain bound on the energy functional.

[18] (see also ref.

following ref. [18], let us dene the quantity:

p( r ,  )  r7p hp(r) ( sin  )7p .
in terms of p( r ,  ), we dene the function fp(r, ) as follows:

fp(r, ) 

p( r ,  ) sin  + dp(  ) cos 
p( r ,  ) cos   dp(  ) sin 

.

(3.2)

(3.3)

making use of the function fp it is easy to verify that the energy can be put in terms of a
square root of a sum of squares. indeed, it is a simple exercise to demonstrate that u can
be written as:

u = t8p 7p z d 

sz 2 + r2h p( r ,  ) cos   dp() sin i2h r

r  fp(r, )i2

,

where z is given by:

z = rh p( r ,  ) cos   dp() sin ih 1 +

r
r

fp(r, )i .

in view of eq. (3.4), it is clear that the energy of the d(8-p)-brane is bounded as:

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

u  t8p 7p z d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

this bound is saturated when r() satises the following rst-order dierential equation:

r
r

= fp(r, ) .

(3.7)

it is straightforward to prove that any function r() that satises eq. (3.7) is also a solution of
the euler-lagrange equation (3.1). notice that the condition (3.7) involves the displacement
eld dp() (see eq. (3.3)). the expressions of the dps have been given at the end of section
2 (eq. (2.22)). however, in order to demonstrate that the solutions of eq. (3.7) verify the
equation of motion (3.1), we do not need to use the explicit form of dp(). the only property
required for this proof is the value of the derivative of dp(), given in eq. (2.14). moreover,
as pointed out in ref. [18] for the p = 3 case, z can be written as a total derivative:

8

z =

d

d h dp() r cos  + (cid:16)

a
8  p

+

r7p

r7p (cid:17) ( r sin  )8pi .

(3.8)

it is important to stress the fact that eq. (3.8) can be proved without using the condition
(3.7) or the euler-lagrange equation (3.1) (only eq. (2.14) has to be used). eq. (3.8) implies
that the bound (3.6) does not depend on the detailed form of the function r(). actually, as
a consequence of eq. (3.8), only the boundary values of r() matter when one evaluates the
right-hand side of eq. (3.6). the functions r() which solve eq. (3.7) correspond to those
d(8-p)-brane embeddings which, for given boundary conditions, have minimal energy. due
to this fact we shall refer to eq. (3.7) as the bps condition. the search for the solutions of
the bps equation and their interpretation will be the subject of the next three sections.

4 the near-horizon solution for p  5

in this section we are going to solve the bps rst-order dierential equation in the near-
horizon geometry for p  5. it will become clear in the process of nding the solution that
the p = 6 case is singled out (as expected from the holographic relation (2.21)). this p = 6
case will be discussed separately in section 5.

let us start by dening the function p(  ) by means of the equation:

1

p(  ) 

r7p h r7p ( sin  )6p cos   dp(  )i .

(4.1)

the right-hand side of eq. (4.1) is known and, thus, p(  ) is a known function of  whose
explicit expression can be obtained by substituting the values of dp(  ), given in eq. (2.22),
in (4.1). moreover, the bps condition (3.7) for a = 0 can be written in terms of p(  ) as:

r
r

=

(sin  )6p  p(  ) cos 

p(  ) sin 

.

(4.2)

a key point in what follows is that p(  ) has a simple derivative, which can be easily
obtained from eq. (2.14), namely:

d
d

p(  ) = ( 6  p) ( sin  )5p .

(4.3)

by inspecting the right-hand side of this equation we observe that p = 6 is a special case.
indeed, when p 6= 6, we can represent the (sin  )6p term appearing in the bps condition
as:

(sin  )6p =

sin 
6  p

d
d

p(  ) ,

(p 6= 6) .

(4.4)

after doing this, the right-hand side of eq. (4.2) is immediately recognized as a logarithmic
derivative and, as a consequence, the bps condition can be readily integrated. the result
one arrives at is:

(4.5)

where c is a positive constant. for p < 5 there is a fractional power of p(  ) in the right-
hand side of eq. (4.5) and, thus, the solution we have found only makes sense for those values
of  such that p(  )  0. moreover, it is clear from eq. (4.3) that:

dp
d  0 ,

( p < 6 , 0     ) ,

(4.6)

and, therefore, p(  ) is a monotonically increasing function in the interval 0    . the
values of p(  ) at  = 0,  are:

where, in order to establish the last inequalities, we have used the fact that 0    1. from
this discussion it follows that there exists a unique value 0 of the polar angle such that:

p ( 0 ) = 0 .

(4.8)

the form of the function p (  ) has been displayed in gure 1. it is clear that the solution
(4.5) is valid for 0    . notice that 0 depends on  and, actually, is a monotonically
increasing function of .
in fact, from eq. (4.7) one concludes that 0 = 0 for  = 0,
whereas 0 =  for  = 1.

for p = 5 the function appearing in the right-hand side of eq. (4.5) is:

5(  ) =     .

thus, our solution in this case is:

( p = 5 ) .

(4.10)

as the radial coordinate r must be non-negative, from eq. (4.10) one immediately concludes
that, also in this p = 5 case, 0    , where now 0 depends linearly on , namely:

0 =   ,

( p = 5 ) .

(4.11)

the solution we have found coincides with the one obtained in refs. [11, 17] for p = 3, 4. our
result (4.5) generalizes these solutions for any p < 6 (the solution for p = 6 will be given in
the next section). by inspecting eq. (4.5) it is easy to conclude that, for  6= 1, r() diverges
when   . actually, when    and  6= 1, r() behaves as:

r(  ) 

1

6p

,

ch p(  )i
  

(  6= 1 ) ,

(4.12)

1

which corresponds to a tube of radius ch p(  )i
6p . we will check below that the energy
of these tubes corresponds to a bundle of (1 )n fundamental strings emanating from the
d(8-p)-brane. when  6= 0 the critical angle 0 is greater than zero and, as a consequence,
eq. (4.5) gives r(0) = 0. actually, when  6= 0, the solution has the shape represented in
gure 2a. on the contrary, when  = 0, the function r() takes a non-vanishing value at the
critical value 0 = 0. notice that, in this last case, both numerator and denominator on the
right-hand side of eq. (4.5) vanish. the behaviour of p(  ) near  = 0 can be obtained by
a taylor expansion. the successive derivatives of p(  ) can be easily computed from the
value of its rst derivative, given in eq. (4.3). it is easy to prove that the rst non-vanishing
derivative of p(  ) at  = 0 is:

moreover, the (7  p)th derivative of p(  ) at  = 0 vanishes, i.e.:

d 6p

d 6p p(  ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0
d 7p p(  ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

d 7p

= ( 6  p )! .

= 0 .

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

therefore, the expression of p(  ) for values of  close to zero takes the form:

p(  )  p( 0 ) +  6p + cp  8p +    ,

where cp is a non-vanishing coecient. substituting this expansion in the right-hand side of
eq. (4.5) for  = 0 leads to the conclusion that:

r( 0 ) = c ,

(  = 0 ) ,

i.e. r(0) 6= 0 for  = 0, as claimed above. moreover, r( 0 ) vanishes in this case:

r( 0 ) = 0 ,

(  = 0 ) .

(4.18)

eq. (4.18) describes a spike at  = 0. we shall refer to the solution (4.18) as a lower tube
solution, in contrast to the upper tube solution of eq. (4.5). actually, these two types of
solutions are related. in order to verify this fact, let us point out that the functions dp(  )
and p(  ) change their sign under the transformation     ,   1  :

dp(  ;  ) = dp(    ; 1   ) ,

p(  ;  ) = p(    ; 1   ) ,

and, therefore, the solutions (4.5) and (4.18) are simply related, namely:

it follows from this relation that the lower ux tubes correspond to n quarks.

r (  ;  ) = r (    ; 1   ) .

12

(4.19)

(4.20)

let us now evaluate, following ref.

[18], the energy for the two types of near-horizon
solutions we have found. these solutions saturate the bound (3.6) and, thus, the energy is
precisely the right-hand side of this equation. moreover, when r is a solution of eq. (3.7), z
can be written as:

z = r [ p( r ,  ) cos   dp(  ) sin  ]h 1 + (cid:16) r 

r (cid:17)2 i .

(4.21)

it is obvious from this equation that, for our solutions, the sign of z is just the sign of
p( r ,  ) cos   dp(  ) sin . moreover, using the denitions of p (eq. (3.2)) and p
(eq. (4.1)), one can prove that:

p( r ,  ) cos   dp(  ) sin  = a r7p ( sin  )7p cos  + r7p p(  ) sin  ,

(4.22)

where we have used the general harmonic function (2.2). in the near-horizon case (a = 0)
the rst term on the right-hand side of eq.
(4.22) is absent and, therefore, the sign of
p( r ,  ) cos   dp(  ) sin  is just the sign of p(). in the solutions (4.5) and (4.18), the
angle  can take values in a range such that p(  ) has a well dened sign. therefore, we
can write:

if we now dene z as:

it is immediate that the energy of our near-horizon bps solutions is:

.

z d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
= (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z d z(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
z  t8p 7p z d z ,

ubp s = | z | .

(4.23)

(4.24)

(4.25)

in order to evaluate z for the near-horizon solutions, we make use of the representation
(3.8) of z as a total derivative. recall that  varies in the range i    f where i = 0
(i = 0) and f =  (f = 0) for the upper (lower) tube solution. it follows that z can be
written as the sum 1:

where zs and zgs are given by:

z = zs + zgs ,

(4.26)

f

zs = t8p 7p dp() r() cos (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
zgs = t8p 7p r7p r() ( sin  )8p(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

i

,

f

i

.

(4.27)

it is clear that z only depends on the values of r() at the boundaries  = i and  = f . in
this sense we can regard z as a topological quantity which, for xed boundary conditions,
is invariant under local variations of the elds [18].

1the labels s and gs refer to spike and ground state, according to the interpretation given to these

two contributions in ref. [18].

13

let us now compute zgs. after substituting the solutions (4.5) and (4.18) of the bps

equations, we get:

zgs = t8p 7p r7p c ( sin )7php(  )i

,

(4.28)

where the + ( ) sign corresponds to the upper (lower) tube solution. the angles i and f
can take the values 0,  and 0. for  = 0,  the right-hand side of eq. (4.28) vanishes due to
the ( sin )7p factor, whereas  = 0 gives also a vanishing contribution because p( 0 ) = 0
(see eq. (4.8)). in conclusion, we can write:

f

i

1

6p (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

zgs = 0 .

(4.29)

in the same way one can obtain the values of zs. one can check in this case that the
contribution of  = 0 to the right-hand side of the rst equation in (4.27) vanishes and, as
a consequence, only  = 0,  contribute. after using eqs. (2.23)-(2.25), one gets the result:

zs = 


(1   ) n tf l ,
  n tf l ,

(upper tube) ,

(lower tube) ,

(4.30)

where l = r() (l = r(0)) for the upper (lower) tube solution.
it is now evident that
ubp s = | zs | is equal to the energy of a bundle of (1  )n or n fundamental strings.
notice that this result is the same as the one found at the end of section 2 for the energy of
the  = 0 and  =  spikes. let us nally mention that in ref.
[18] it has been argued in
favor of interpreting zs as a central charge in the worldvolume supersymmetry algebra.

5 the near-horizon d6-d2 system

in this section we are going to integrate the bps condition for p = 6. notice that, according
to the denition (4.1) and the expression of d6() given in eq. (2.22), 6 (  ) is constant,
i.e.:

6 (  ) = 1  2  .

(5.1)

for p = 6 we cannot use eq. (4.4) and, hence, we have to deal directly with eq. (4.2).
actually, eq. (4.2) makes sense only for  6= 1/2 since 6 (  ), and therefore the denominator
of eq. (4.2) vanishes identically for  = 1
2. with this restriction2, the p = 6 bps condition
is:

(5.2)

it is not dicult to realize that the right-hand side of eq. (5.2) can be written as a total
derivative, namely:

2 the fact that the p = 6,  = 1/2 bps condition is ill-dened is an artifact of the near-horizon

approximation.

where a is a positive constant. the nature of the solution (5.4) depends critically on the
value of . first of all, the range of values of  is not restricted, i.e. 0    . if 0   < 1/2,
the cos (/2) term present in the denominator of (5.4) makes r   at   , whereas for
1/2 <   1 the solution diverges at   0. actually, the solution for 0   < 1/2 is related
to the one for 1/2 <   1 by means of the equation:

r(  ;  ) = r(    ; 1   ) .

(5.5)

eq. (5.5) can be checked easily from the expression (5.4). notice that for 0 <  < 1/2
(1/2 <  < 1) the d2 brane passes through the point r = 0. this behaviour is similar to the
p < 6 case. however, the present solution diers substantially from those studied in section
4.
in order to make this dierence manifest, let us introduce the cylindrical coordinates
(z, ) as follows:

(5.6)
the behaviour of the coordinate  in the region in which r   is of special interest to
interpret the asymptotic behaviour of the brane. it is not dicult to nd how  depends on
 for the solution (5.4):

z = r cos  ,

 = r sin  .

(5.7)

clearly, when  < 1/2,    for   , whereas if  > 1/2 the coordinate  diverges for
  0. this implies that our solution does not behave as a tube 3. this fact is more explicit
if we rewrite our solution (5.4) as a function z = z(). after a short calculation, we get:

2

z =

2 a12 (cid:16) 2(12)  a2(12)(cid:17) .

tions are the same as in gure 2.

and thus, as expected, z  + (z  ) for  < 1/2 ( > 1/2). moreover, eq. (5.9)
implies that the asymptotic shape of the solution is that of a paraboloid 4 rather than a tube.
we have thus an upper paraboloid for  < 1/2 and a lower paraboloid for  > 1/2. in
gure 3 we have plotted the p = 6 solution for dierent values of . notice that for  6= 0, 1
z() has an extremum for some value of  6= 0, while for  = 0, 1 the extremum is located
at  = 0. this extremum is a minimum (maximum) for  < 1/2 ( > 1/2). it is interesting
to point out that, although the solution for p = 6 diers from the ones found for p  5, the
energy u is still given by |zs|, where zs is the same as in eq. (4.30).
it follows from our previous analysis that  = 1/2 is a critical point in the behaviour
of the d6-d2 system. the bps condition (5.2) is not dened in this case and we have to
come back to the equation of motion (3.1). fortunately, we will be able to nd the general
solution of the eld equation in this case. the key point in this respect is the observation
that, for p = 6 and  = 1/2, the near-horizon energy density does not depend on  explicitly.
indeed, a simple calculation shows that:

u = t2 1 r z d r2 + r  2 ,

this -independence implies the conservation law:

(  =

) .

r   u = constant ,

or, using the explicit form of u given in eq. (5.10):

4 strictly speaking, only for  = 0, 1 eq. (5.8) represents a paraboloid.

where c  0 is constant. it is not dicult to integrate the rst-order equation (5.12). the
result is:

,

(5.13)

 being a new integration constant. the solution (5.13) represents a cone with opening
half-angle  and with its vertex located at a distance c/sin  from the origin (see gure 4).
this fact is neatly shown if we rewrite (5.13) in terms of the cylindrical coordinates (, z)
dened in eq. (5.6). in these coordinates, eq. (5.13) becomes:

 cos   z sin  = c .

(5.14)
it is clear from gure 4 that  can take values in the range /2    /2. when  = 0
the cone degenerates in the cylinder  = c, while for  = /2 the solution (5.14) is the
plane z = c. notice that eq.
(5.14) is invariant under the transformation   ,
z  z. thus, for  > 0 ( < 0) z goes to + () when the angle  takes the value
   (). it is interesting to point out that, when   , z diverges linearly with ,
which is, certainly, the limiting case of the  6= 1/2 situation (see eq. (5.9)). this softer
behaviour for  = 1/2 will be also reected in the solution for the full dp-brane metric, as
we shall check in the next section, where we will nd the solutions of the bps equation for
the full dp-brane brane metric (2.1). we will check that for p = 6 and  = 1/2 this solution
is equivalent, in the near-horizon region, to our general solution (5.14) with c = 0, i.e. only
those cones passing through the origin correspond to bps solutions of the asymptotically
at metric.

17

a
6 asymptotically at background

in this section we are going to study the solutions of the bps condition beyond the near-
horizon approximation. recall that the full metric of the dp-brane background is obtained by
taking a = 1 in the harmonic function (2.2). the full dp-brane metric is asymptotically at
and, therefore, one expects that a brane placed far away from the location of the background
branes is not bent by the gravitational eld. we shall concentrate rst in the study of this
asymptotic behaviour and, afterwards, we will consider the complete solution.

it is convenient for our purposes to rewrite the bps condition (3.7) in the coordinates
(z, ) of eq. (5.6). in these coordinates, the d(8-p)-brane embedding is characterized by a
function z(  ). the bps equation gives d z/d  in terms of (z, ). actually, it is not dicult
to relate z(  ) and its derivative to r() and r (). by using only the relation between both
coordinate systems one can verify that:

dz
d

=

sin   cos  r 
r
cos  + sin  r 
r

.

(6.1)

by substituting the value of the ratio r /r given by eq. (3.7) for a = 1 on the right-hand side
of this equation, one arrives at the following rst-order dierential equation for the function
z(  ):

(6.2)

it is now elementary to evaluate the right-hand side of eq. (6.2) in the asymptotic region in
which   , z/  0 (and   /2). in this limit, eq. (6.2) takes the form:

dz
d  

dp( /2 )

7p

+    ,

(6.3)

where we have only kept the rst term in the expansion in powers of r/. notice that
z ()  0 as   , according to our expectations. however, also in this approach, the
behaviour of the p = 6 case diers from that corresponding to p < 6. indeed, for p = 6,
z ()  1 and z() diverges logarithmically in the asymptotic region while, for p < 6, z()
approaches a constant value as   . let us specify further these two kinds of behaviours.
the coecient multiplying the power of  on the right-hand side of eq. (6.3) is dp(/2),
which can be computed from eq. (2.22):

using this result we can integrate eq. (6.3). for p < 6, we get:

where z is a constant representing the asymptotic value of z. from eq. (6.5) one concludes
that the sign of z  z depends on the sign of 1
i.e. if  < 1/2 ( > 1/2) the
brane reaches its asymptotic value of z from below (above). if p = 6 we get the expected
logarithmic dependence:

2  .

z (  )  ( 1  2 ) r log  +    .

(6.6)
notice that when    in eq. (6.6), z  + if  < 1/2 while, on the contrary, z  
for  > 1/2, in agreement with our near-horizon analysis of section 5. it is interesting to
point out that, although in this case z diverges as   , z/ still vanishes in this limit, as
assumed in the derivation of eq. (6.3).
for  = 1/2, the leading term in the asymptotic expansion vanishes and we have to
compute the next-to-leading term. this does not change signicantly the analysis of the
p < 6 case. however, for p = 6, things change drastically when  = 1/2. in fact, one can
prove from eq. (6.2) that, in this case, z approaches a constant value z as    (and,
actually, z  z decreases as 1 for  >> r).
let us now see how one can integrate exactly the bps condition for the full metric.
the resulting solution must reproduce the asymptotic behaviour we have just described.
for p = 3, eq. (6.2) was integrated numerically in ref.
[11]. as we shall show below, our
analytical solution agrees with these numerical results. it is more convenient to come back
to our original (r, ) coordinates. the basic strategy we will adopt to integrate the bps
equation is to write it in terms of the same function p(  ) that we have already used to nd
the near-horizon solutions. for illustrative purposes, we will do it for a general value of the
parameter a of the harmonic function. after using the denition (4.1), eq. (3.7) can be put
in the form:

r 
r

=

a r7p ( sin  )8p + r7p ( sin  )6p  r7p p(  ) cos 

a r7p ( sin  )7p cos  + r7p p(  ) sin 

.

(6.7)

notice that eq. (6.7) for a = 0 is identical to eq. (4.2). let us now isolate the terms of (6.7)
depending on a in one of the sides of the equation. doing this, it is elementary to prove that
eq. (6.7) can be rewritten as:

a r7p ( sin  )7p d
d

( r cos  ) = r7ph r ( sin  )6p  p(  )

on the right-hand side of this expression we recognize a term containing (sin  )6p, whose
representation as a derivative of the function p(  ) was crucial to integrate the near-horizon
bps condition for p 6= 6. actually, assuming that p 6= 6 and using eq. (4.4), our dierential
equation becomes:

taking a = 0 we recover the solutions (4.5) and (4.18). from now on we shall put a = 1 in
all our expressions. in this case we can pass the r7p ( sin  )7p factor in the left-hand side
of eq. (6.9) to the right-hand side and, remarkably, this equation can be written as:

(6.11)

where z is a constant of integration which can be identied with the asymptotic value of z
introduced in eq. (6.5). actually, in terms of the coordinates (z, ), our solution (6.11) can
be written as:

z = z

(6.12)

eqs. (6.11) and (6.12) give the analytical solution of the bps dierential equation for p 6= 6.
it is easy to verify that eq. (6.12) for    is reduced to eq. (6.5). moreover, by derivating
both sides of eq. (6.12) with respect to , one can extract the value of dz/d. the result in
terms of (z, ) is precisely the one written in (6.2), i.e. the function z() dened by (6.12) is
a solution of the bps condition in cylindrical coordinates.

let us now study the analytical solution we have found and, specially, how it interpolates
between the near-horizon and asymptotic regions. notice, rst of all, that eqs. (6.11) and

20

(6.12) give r() and z() in implicit form. in particular, eq. (6.11) determines r() as the
root of a polynomial of degree 7  p which, for p  3, can be solved algebraically. however,
the implicit equations (6.11) and (6.12) are much easier to handle and, actually, can be
used to plot the embeddings. in gure 5 we have represented these embeddings for dierent
values of  and z. moreover, by studying eqs. (6.11) and (6.12) we can characterize the
general features of our bps solutions. the detailed analysis of these solutions is performed
in appendix a. it follows from this analysis that our solution (6.12) coincides with the near-
horizon embeddings in a region close to the origin. actually, as can be seen from the plots of
gure 5, the integral of the bps dierential equation for the full metric contains cylindrical
regions which resemble closely the tubes found in the near-horizon analysis. it is not dicult
to relate the parameter z of eq. (6.12) to the constant c appearing in the lower and upper
tube solutions (eqs. (4.5) and (4.18)). for large | z | it can be seen that both types of
solutions are approximately equal if we are suciently near the origin and if the following
relation:

for 0 <  < 1 the solution reaches the origin r = 0 by means of a tube, which is an upper
or lower tube depending on the sign of z (see gure 5). for | z |   we will verify that
this tubes can be regarded as bundles of fundamental strings, exactly in the same way as in
the near-horizon case.

the behaviour of the  = 0 solution is dierent from that we have just described for
0 <  < 15. when z  , the d(8-p)-brane is nearly at. as we increase z, an upper
tube develops and for z  + a bundle of n fundamental strings, connecting the dp
and d(8-p) branes, is created. as pointed out in ref. [11], this solution provides a concrete
realization of the so-called hanany-witten eect [15].

let us now study the energy of our solutions.

it is clear from the plots of gure 5
that r is not a single-valued function of .
it is thus more convenient to use the (z, )
coordinates in order to have a global description of the energy functional. from eq. (2.18)
it is straightforward to obtain the expression of u as an integral over . the result can be
put in the form:

u = t8p 7p z d s(cid:16) p  dp

dz

d (cid:17)2

+ (cid:16) dp + p

dz

d (cid:17)2

.

(6.14)

in eq. (6.14) dp depends on  and z() as in eq. (6.2) and p is the function dened in
eq. (3.2). it is important to stress that eq. (6.14) gives the energy for any embedding z().
notice that on the right-hand side of eq. (6.14) we have the sum of two squares. the second
of these two terms vanishes when the bps condition dz/d = dp/p (see eq. (6.2)) holds.
it is clear from these considerations that, if we dene:

5the solution for  = 1 can be reduced to that for  = 0 (see eq. (a.1)).

we obtain the following lower bound for the energy of any embedding:

u  t8p 7p z d (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

x(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

(6.16)

the bound (6.16) is saturated precisely when the embedding satises the rst-order bps
equation (6.2). a remarkable aspect of the function x appearing in the right-hand side of
eq. (6.16) is that it can be put as a total derivative. indeed, one can verify that:

x =

(6.17)

eq. (6.17) is the analog in these coordinates of eq. (3.8). as it happened with eq. (3.8),
in order to prove eq. (6.17) one only has to use eq. (2.14) and, therefore, (6.17) is valid for
any function z(). an important consequence of eq. (6.17) is that the bound (6.16) only
depends on the boundary conditions of the embedding at innity. thus, one can say that
the bps embeddings are those that minimize the energy for a given value of z() at   .
from eq. (6.14) it is very easy to obtain the energy ubp s of one of such bps solutions. the
result one arrives at is:

ubp s =  t8p 7p z d h dz

d

+ (cid:16) dz

d (cid:17)1i dp .

(6.18)

apart from being simple, eq. (6.18) is specially suited for our purposes. notice, rst of all,
that the integrand on the right-hand side of (6.18) is always non-negative due to eq. (6.2).
secondly, we can use (6.18) to evaluate the energy of a tubular portion of the brane. indeed,
is large in one of these tubes and the argument of dp is almost constant

for large |z|, (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
and equal to  (0) for an upper (lower) tube. neglecting the term containing (cid:16) dz

right-hand side of eq. (6.18), and dening the length of the tube as:

d (cid:17)1

dz

d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

on the

(6.19)

(6.20)

we get the following values for the energy of the tubes:

ltube = ztube

,

d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

dz

d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

 t8p 7p dp(  ) ltube ,
t8p 7p dp( 0 ) ltube ,

(upper tube) ,

(lower tube) .

utube = 


taking into account eqs. (2.23) and (2.25), and using eq. (2.24), one can easily show
from the result in eq. (6.20) that utube coincides with |zs|, where the values of zs are given
in eq. (4.30). this conrms our interpretation of the tubes as bundles of (1  )n and n
fundamental strings.
it is not dicult to calculate the energy of the whole brane. actually, by means of
eq. (6.17) we can perform the integral appearing in the right-hand side of eq. (6.18). as we
are calculating the energy of an innite brane, this integral is divergent. in order to regulate
this divergence, let us introduce a cuto c, in such a way that the integral in eq. (6.18) is
performed between  = 0 and  = c. it is not dicult to check from the properties of our

22

solutions that the contribution of the lower limit  = 0 is zero and, thus, only the value at
the cuto contributes. after this process, ubp s can be put as:

ubp s = t8p 7p " z dp  (cid:16)

1
8  p

+

r7p

( 2 + z2 )

7p

2 (cid:17) 8p # = c

.

(6.21)

we have now to take c   and, therefore, z( c )  z. notice that, in this limit, the
argument of the function dp is /2. using eq. (6.4), ubp s can be put as a sum of two terms,
namely:

ubp s = (cid:16) 1

2  (cid:17) n tf z + t8p 7p " 8p
8  p

c

+ r7p c# .

(6.22)

notice that the rst term on the right-hand side of eq. (6.22) is nite and depends linearly
on z, while the second term diverges when c   and is independent of z. according
to ref.
[18], one can give the following interpretation to this divergence. let us consider a
d(8-p)-brane embedded in the metric (2.1) along the plane z = 0 or, equivalently, such that
its worldvolume is determined by the equation  = /2. notice that in this conguration
the brane is not bent at all and, for this reason, it will be referred to as the ground state
of the brane. let ggs be the induced metric on the worldvolume of the d(8-p)-brane for this
ground state conguration. putting the worldvolume gauge elds to zero and substituting
g by ggs in eq. (2.6), we get the action of the ground state:

sgs = t8p z d9p  e  qdet ( ggs ) .

the energy egs of the ground state is obtained from sgs as:

sgs
t

egs = 
where t = r dt. using the metric given in eq.

(2.1) and the value of the dilaton eld
displayed in eq. (2.5), the calculation of egs is a simple exercise. by comparing the result of
this computation with the right-hand side of eq. (6.22), one discovers that egs is equal to
the divergent contribution to ubp s. therefore, one can subtract egs from ubp s and dene
a renormalized energy uren as:

,

(6.23)

(6.24)

(6.25)

(6.26)

it follows from eq. (6.22) that uren is given by:

uren  ubp s  egs .

uren = (cid:16) 1

2  (cid:17) n tf z .

by derivating uren with respect to z, we learn that there is a net constant force acting on
the d(8-p)-brane, which is equal to ( 1
fundamental strings. in ref. [11] this force was interpreted as a consequence of the fact that,
due to the p + 2-form ux captured by the d(8-p)-brane, the latter is endowed with an
eective charge equal to ( 1

2  (cid:17) n tf , i.e. equivalent to the tension of ( 1

(6.29) has the asymptotic behaviour displayed in eq.

where k is a constant of integration. it is easy to check that the function z() parametrized
by eq.
it follows that, as
expected, z() does not reach a constant value for p = 6 and  6= 1/2. the proles of the
 6= 1/2 curves are similar to the near-horizon ones, plotted in gure 3. the only dierence
is that, instead of the behaviour written in eq. (5.9), | z()| grows logarithmically as   .
moreover, similarly to what happens to the p  5 solution, eq. (6.29) is invariant under the
transformation:

it is also easy to check that the function z() dened by eq. (6.29) coincides, in the

identied as follows:

for  = 1/2 the behaviour of the solution changes drastically. indeed, in this case, one

the function (6.32) has been represented graphically in gure 6. from this plot one notices
that lim z() = k. actually, one can prove using eq. (6.32) that for k  0 (k  0) the
variable z takes values in the range 0  z  k (k  z  0). thus, in this (p = 6,  = 1/2)
case, the constant k plays the same role as z did for p  5. in particular, for k = 0 the
solution (6.32) is equivalent to the equation z = 0, which is precisely the same solution we
found for p  5,  = 1/2 and z = 0, i.e. one obtains the ground state solution in both
cases.
let us nally point out that, by linearizing eq. (6.32) in  and z, one gets the equation

of a cone passing through the origin and with half-angle equal to:

tan  =

therefore, with the identication (6.33), we get a perfect agreement with the near-horizon
solutions (5.14) with c = 0.

7 summary and conclusions

in this paper we have studied the embedding of a d(8-p)-brane in the background geometry
of a stack of coincident dp-branes. this embedding is governed by the worldvolume action of
the d(8-p)-brane (eq. (2.1)), which determines the equation of motion (3.1). by using a bps
argument we have found a bound for the energy of the system such that those embeddings
which saturate it are also a solution of the equation of motion. this equation of motion
(eq. (3.7)) is a rst-order dierential equation which, amazingly, can be solved analytically
both in the near-horizon and asymptotically at geometries.

the solutions of the bps equations give the deformation of the d(8-p)-brane under the
inuence of the gravitational and rr elds created by the background branes. generically,
these solutions contain tubes connecting the d(8-p)-brane to the background branes which,
after analyzing its energy, can be interpreted as bundles of fundamental strings. from the
point of view of the gauge theory dened on the worldvolume of the background branes,
these tubes represent baryonic multiquark states.

there are several topics which were not covered by our analysis which, in our opinion,
it would be interesting to consider in a future work. let us mention some of them. first
of all, it would be interesting to understand the relation between the bps condition and
supersymmetry. one expects, following the line of ref. [12], that the bps dierential equation
is precisely the requirement one must impose to the brane embedding in order to preserve
some fraction of the space-time supersymmetry. an analysis of the supersymmetry algebra,
by applying the methods of ref. [24], could shed light on this aspect of the problem.

another topic which would be worth to explore is the use that our exact results could have
in the study of baryons in gauge theories both in the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric

25

models. in the latter case we have to extend our results to the situation in which the back-
ground brane conguration is not extremal.

finally, it would be interesting to nd out if there exist bps conditions, similar to the
ones found here, for brane embeddings in more general brane geometries, such as the ones
corresponding to the intersection of several branes of dierent types.

the nal goal of these studies is twofold. on the one hand, we would like to know what
string theory can teach us about the non-perturbative structure of gauge theories while, at
the same time, we would like to uncover aspects of a more complete formulation of string
theory.

appendix a

in this appendix we are going to carry out an study of the solution found in section 6 of
the bps dierential equation for the asymptotically at metric for p  5 (eqs. (6.11) and
(6.12)).
the rst thing we want to point out in this respect is that, due to the property of p

displayed in eq. (4.19), our solution (6.12) is invariant under the transformation:

   ,

z  z ,

(a.1)
due to this invariance we can restrict ourselves to the case 0    1/2. the solutions
outside this range of  can be obtained by performing a reection with respect to the z = 0
axis. therefore, unless otherwise stated, we will assume in what follows that   1/2.
moreover, it is more convenient for our purposes to rewrite eq. (6.12) in the equivalent form:

z  z ,

  1   .

( z  z ) 6p =

(a.2)

r7p
6  p

p(cid:16) arctan (/z)(cid:17) .

we will start our analysis of the solution by studying its cut with the  = 0 axis. by looking
at eq. (a.2) it follows immediately that p must vanish for  = 0. thus, the angle  at which
the solution reaches the  = 0 axis must be  = 0, 0 being the same angle appearing in
the near-horizon solution (see eq. (4.8)). following eq. (5.6),  = r() sin  and, therefore,
if  = 0 for  = 0 one must have r(0) sin 0 = 0. there are two possibilities to fulll this
equation. if, rst of all,  6= 0, the angle 0 is non-vanishing, which means that, necessarily,
r(0) = 0, i.e. the solution reaches the origin r = 0 at an angle 0. notice that, as it should
occur near r = 0, this is precisely what happens in the near-horizon solution. the second
possibility is  = 0. in this case 0 = 0 and the vanishing of  does not require r = 0. again,

26

this is in agreement with the near-horizon solution. actually, the distance r(0) at which the
 = 0 solution cuts the  = 0 axis can be determined, as in section 4, by expanding p()
around 0 = 0. using eq. (4.15) one gets that r(0) must satisfy:

r7p
6  p

[ r(0) ]6p [ r(0) + z ] =

,

(  = 0 ) .

(a.3)

as the right-hand side of this equation is positive, it follows that r(0) > z. when this
condition is satised, the left-hand side of eq. (a.3) is a monotonically increasing function
of r(0) and, therefore, there exists a unique solution for r(0).

let us now consider the cut with the z = 0 axis. we shall denote the corresponding value
of the  coordinate by 0, i.e. 0 = ( z = 0 ). if 0 6= 0, the value of the angle  for z = 0
is  = /2 and, after evaluating the function p for this value of , eq. (a.2) gives:

0 = 2

(cid:16) 7p

.

(a.4)

notice that for  6= 1/2 the right-hand side of eq. (a.4) only makes sense for z > 0.
therefore, only for z > 0 the solution for  6= 1/2 cuts the z = 0 axis at a nite non-
vanishing value of the coordinate . for  = 1/2 and z 6= 0 eq. (a.4) has no solution for
0 6= 0. all these features appear in the plots of gure 5.
from eq. (a.2) one can extract the range of allowed values of the coordinate z. indeed, it
follows from eq. (a.2) that the signs of z  z and p are the same. on the other hand, we
know that p() is positive for  > 0 and negative for  < 0. thus, when  > 0 ( < 0)
one must have z < z (z > z), while for  = 0 either  = 0 or else z = z. as 0  /2
for   1/2, one can easily see that these results imply that z  0 for z  0, whereas z can
be positive or negative if z > 0.
it is easy to prove that z, as a function of , must have a unique extremum. for  < 1/2
this extremum is actually a minimum, as we are going to verify soon. from eq. (6.2) it is
clear that dz/d vanishes if and only if dp is zero. recall that the gauss law (eq. (2.14))
implies that dp is a monotonically decreasing function of  (see gure 1). moreover, it follows
from eqs. (2.23) and (2.25) that dp(0)  0 and dp()  0. thus, it must necessarily exist
a unique value m of  such that:

dp( m ) = 0 .

(a.5)

clearly, at the point of the curve z() at which  = m the derivative dz/d is zero. it is
interesting to compare m with the angle 0 for which p is zero. by substituting  = 0 in
the equation which relates dp(  ) and p(  ) (eq. (4.1)), one gets:

dp( 0 ) = r7p ( sin 0 )6p cos 0 .

(a.6)
for   1/2 one has 0  /2 and, thus, eq. (a.6) gives dp( 0 )  0. the monotonic
character of dp(  ) implies that 0  0  m  /2 . notice that 0 = m if  = 0
(0 = m = 0) or  = 1/2 (0 = m = /2). the coordinate z of the extremum is
zm = r(m) cos m. as m  /2, one must have zm  0. moreover, since m  0, then
p(m)  0 and eq. (a.2) gives zm  z. by using the value of p at  = m, which is:

27

(see eq. (4.1)) one can obtain an expression which determines zm, namely:

p(m) = ( sin m )6p cos m ,

(a.7)

(a.8)

| zm |6p ( z  zm ) =

r7p

6  p (cid:16) cos m(cid:17)7p

.

it is not dicult to verify now that, when  < 1/2, the extremum at  = m is a minimum.
in order to prove it, one must evaluate d2z/d2. this can be done by derivating eq. (6.2).
after putting  = m = r(m) sin m, and using the fact that dz/d vanishes for  = m,
one arrives at:

d2 z

d2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = m

= 

( 2

m + z2

( 7  p ) r7p
m ) h r7p + ( 2

m + z2

m )

7p

2 i

zm .

(a.9)

when  < 1/2, one has zm < 0 and, as a consequence, the right-hand side of eq. (a.9) is
strictly positive. therefore z() has a minimum for  = m as claimed. notice that, when
 = 1/2, i.e. m = /2, the right-hand side of eq. (a.8) vanishes and, thus, zm = 0 (the
value z = z is reached asymptotically).

eq. (a.8) can be solved immediately if z = 0. indeed, in this case, one has:

| zm |7p =

r7p

6  p (cid:16) cos m(cid:17)7p

,

( z = 0 ) .

(a.10)

for general values of z we cannot give the general solution of eq. (a.8). however, one can
extract valuable information from this equation. an important point concerning eq. (a.8)
is the fact that its right-hand side does not depend on z (it only depends on p and ) and,
therefore, it remains constant when we change the asymptotic value of the z coordinate.
this allows us to study the behaviour of the minimum in dierent limiting situations. let us
suppose, rst of all, that z  + for  < 1/2. as zm < 0, the dierence z zm  +.
in order to keep the right-hand side of eq. (a.8) nite, one must have zm  0. actually
zm should behave as:

zm  

1

( z )

1

6p

,

( z  + ,  <

1
2

) .

(a.11)

on the other hand if z  , again for  < 1/2, the only possibility to maintain
| zm |6p ( z  zm ) constant is that z  zm  0+ (recall that zm  z and, thus, zm  0
is impossible if z  ). the actual behaviour of z  zm in this limit is:

z  zm 

1

( z )6p ,

( z   ,  <

1
2

) .

(a.12)

the  = 0 embedding presents some characteristics which make it dierent from the
 6= 0 ones. we have already shown that the  = 0 solution cuts the  = 0 axis at a
coordinate z = r(0), with r(0) determined by eq. (a.3). moreover, for  = 0 the function
p on the right-hand side of eq. (a.2) is non-negative for all  6= 0, which implies that
z  z for these solutions. recall that, in this case, z() has a minimum at  = 0. for

28

z  , due to eq. (a.12), z() is approximately a constant function, i.e. z()  z.
if, on the contrary, z  +, an upper tube connecting the point z = r(0)  0 (see
eq. (a.11)) and the asymptotic region is developed (see gure 5).
 = 1/2 is also a special case. indeed, for  = 1/2 the angle 0 is equal to /2 and,
therefore, the function p in eq. (a.2) takes positive (negative) values for z > 0 (z < 0). by
studying the signs of both sides of eq. (a.2) one easily concludes that for z > 0 one must
have 0  z < z, whereas for z < 0 the coordinate z takes values on the range z < z  0
(see gure 5). when z = 0, the analysis of eq. (a.2) leads to the conclusion that the
solution is the hyperplane z = 0.

it is also possible to determine the range of possible values that the coordinate  can take.
actually  has generically an extremal value, which we shall denote by . the existence of
 can be proved by computing the derivative d/dr for our solution. a short calculation
proves that this derivative vanishes if the coordinate z takes the value:

z =

z .

alternatively, one could determine z as the point at which the denominator of the bps
condition (3.7) vanishes. by computing the second derivative d2/dr2 at  = , one can
check that  is a minimum (maximum) if z < 0 (z > 0)6. it is also interesting to point
out that for z = z the function z of eq. (4.21) changes its sign. this is consistent with the
extremal nature of .
