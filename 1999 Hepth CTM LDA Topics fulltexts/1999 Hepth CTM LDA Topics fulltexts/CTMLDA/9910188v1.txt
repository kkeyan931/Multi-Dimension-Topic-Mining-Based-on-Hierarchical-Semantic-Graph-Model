abstract

we derive consistent equations of motion for the massive spin two eld interact-
ing with gravity and massless scalar dilaton eld in arbitrary spacetime dimension.
from the eld theoretical point of view we describe the most general classical action
with non-minimal couplings and nd the most general gravitational background on
which this action describes a theory consistent with the at space limit and causal.
we show also that the massive spin two eld can be consistently described in ar-
bitrary background by means of either non-lagrangian equations or the lagrangian
ones representing an innite series in the inverse mass square. within string theory
we obtain equations of motion for the massive spin two eld coupled to gravity from
the requirement of quantum weyl invariance of the corresponding two dimensional
sigma-model. in the lowest order in  we demonstrate that explicit form of these
eective equations of motion coincides with the general form of consistent equations
derived in eld theory.

1 introduction

the problem of consistent description of higher spin elds interaction has a long history
but is still far from the complete resolution. within framework of standard eld theory
it is possible to construct a classical action for the higher spin elds only on specic
curved spacetime manifolds [1][6]1. for example, massive integer spins are described
by symmetric tensors of corresponding ranks and one can write down the equations of
motion and nd classical actions for them but only in special spacetimes (e.g.
in ricci
it means that gravity eld should not be dynamical, it does not feel the
at spaces).
presence of higher spins matter through an energy-momentum tensor. so a consistent
classical action for gravity and a higher massive eld is not known and there are some
indications that it does not exist at all.

one of these indications comes from considering a kaluza-klein decomposition of
einstein gravity in ddimensional spacetime into gravity plus innite tower of massive
second rank tensor elds in (d  1)dimensional world, masses being proportional to
inverse compactication radius. the resulting four dimensional theory of spin 2 elds
interacting with gravity and with each other should be consistent as we started from the
ordinary einstein theory and just consider it on a specic manifold. but as was shown in
[9], it is impossible to reduce this theory consistently to a nite number of spin 2 elds,
i.e. consistency can be achieved only if the whole innite tower of higher massive elds
are present in the theory.

however, one can try to achieve consistency by constructing equations for higher
massive elds in form of innite series in inverse mass (or, equivalently, in curvature). a
recent attempt in this direction was undertaken in [6] where, however, only theories on
symmetric einstein manifolds were considered and consistent equations were derived in
the order linear in curvature.

in this paper we show that consistent equations for the spin 2 massive eld can, in
principle, be constructed as innite series in inverse mass square in arbitrary gravitational
background. these kinds of innite series arise naturally in string theory which represent
another approach for consistent description of higher spins interaction.

string theory contains an innite number of massive elds with various spins inter-
acting with each other and with a nite number of massless elds. unfortunately, there
are arguments that in string theory a general coordinate invariant eective eld action
reproducing the correct s-matrix both for massless and massive string states does not
exist [10]. the full eective action for all string elds is not general coordinate invariant
and general covariance arises only as an approximate symmetry in eective action for
massless elds once all the massive elds are integrated out. that eective action for
massive elds cannot be covariant follows, for example, from the fact that terms cubic in
massive elds can contain only at metric and there is no terms of higher powers [10].

1for description of higher spin massless elds on specic background see e.g. [7] and [8] for the case

of a collection of massless spin-2 elds

inuence of massive string modes is negligible at low energies but they become im-
portant, for instance, in string cosmology [11] so it would be desirable to have consistent
equations describing interaction of the massive string elds.

and indeed, there exists a possibility to derive from the string theory some covariant
parts of equations for massive higher spins elds interacting with background gravity.
the aim of our paper is to show explicitly how this procedure works using as an example
dynamics of the second rank tensor from the rst massive level of open bosonic string.

a convenient method of deriving eective eld equations of motion from the string
theory is provided by the model approach [12][22]. within this approach a string
interacting with background elds is described by a two dimensional eld theory and
eective equations of motion arise from the requirement of quantum weyl invariance.
perturbative derivation of these equations is well suited for massless string modes be-
cause the corresponding two dimensional theory is renormalizable and loop expansion
corresponds to expansion of string eective action in powers of string length .

inclusion of interaction with massive modes [23][31] makes the theory non-renorma-
lizable but this fact does not represent a problem since in string theory one considers
the whole innite set of massive elds. innite number of counterterms needed for can-
cellation of divergences generating by a specic massive eld in classical action leads to
renormalization of an innite number of massive elds. the only property of the theory
crucial for possibility of derivation of perturbative information is that number of massive
elds giving contributions to renormalization of the given eld should be nite. as was
shown in [26] string theory does fulll this requirement. to calculate function for
any massive eld it is sucient to nd divergences coming only from a nite number of
other massive elds and so it is possible to derive eective equations of motion for any
background elds in any order in .

this procedure have serious limitation  it does not allow to derive non-perturbative
contributions to the string eective action. it is well known that correct terms cubic in
massive elds (quadratic terms in equations of motion) cannot be found within perturba-
tive renormalization of model. for example, perturbative function of tachyon eld
is linear in all orders in  and interacting tachyonic terms are due to non-perturbative
(from the point of view of two dimensional eld theory) eects [33].

to nd these non-perturbative contribution one should use the method exact renor-
malization group (erg) [34][39]. it is ideally suited for string theory because, rst of all,
its formulation does not require any a priori dened perturbative scheme, and secondly,
the equations of exact renormalization group are quadratic in interaction terms thus re-
sembling the cubic structure of exact string eld action. but erg method also has a
serious disadvantage as it requires explicit separation of classical action into free and in-
teraction parts and thus leads to non-covariant equations for background elds. from the
general point of view this fact does not contradict general properties of string theory. we
have already mentioned that exact eective action describing both massless and massive
string modes should be non-covariant. but non-covariance of the erg method makes

2

it rather dicult to establish relations between string elds equations and ordinary eld
theory.

so in this paper we derive covariant equations of motion for massive string elds
interacting with gravity by means of ordinary perturbative analysis of quantum weyl
invariance condition in the corresponding model. of course, perturbatively we can
obtain equations only linear in massive elds. it was noted long ago [10] that one can
make such a eld redenition in the string eective action that terms quadratic in massive
elds (linear terms in equations of motion) acquire dependence on arbitrary higher powers
of massless elds and so may be covariant.
in this paper we explicitly obtain these
interaction terms in the lowest in  approximation. we do not get terms quadratic in
massive elds which should be non-covariant and arise non-perturbatively.

as a model for our calculations we use bosonic open string theory interacting with
background elds of the massless and the rst massive levels. first massive level con-
tains symmetric second rank tensor and so this model provides the simplest example of
massive higher spin eld interacting with gravity. in order to obtain equations of motion
for string elds we build eective action for the corresponding two dimensional theory,
perform renormalization of background elds and composite operators and construct the
renormalized operator of energy momentum tensor trace.

this rather standard scheme was rst developed for calculations in closed string theory
with massless background elds [13, 20, 21] and then was generalized for the open string
theory [40, 42, 43, 44] and for strings in massive elds [26]. the new feature appearing
in open string theory is that the corresponding two dimensional sigma model represents
a quantum eld theory on a manifold with a boundary. to construct quantum eective
action in such a theory we use generalization of schwinger-de witt method for manifolds
with boundaries developed in the series of papers [45].

making perturbative calculations we restrict ourselves to string world sheets with
topology of a disk. the resulting equations of motion for graviton will not contain depen-
dence on massive elds from the open string spectrum because these elds interact only
with the boundary of world sheet and so can not inuence the local physics in the bulk.
for example, in the case of graviton and massive elds from the open string spectrum
one expects that equations of motion for the graviton should look like ordinary vacuum
einstein equations without any matter. of course, one can obtain contributions from
open string background elds to the right hand side of einstein equations for gravity but
it would demand considering of world sheets of higher genus [41, 43].

the organization of the paper is as follows. in the sec. 2 we describe the most gen-
eral consistent equations of motion for massive spin 2 eld on a specic class of curved
manifolds from the point of view of ordinary eld theory and generalize them for the
interaction with scalar dilaton eld in the sec. 3. in the next section we show how the
scheme can be generalized to the case of arbitrary gravitational background by means of
either non-lagrangian equations or equations representing innite series in inverse mass.
sec. 5 contains description of the string model that we use for derivations of eective

3

equations of motion of string massive elds. we calculate divergences of the theory in
the lowest order, carry out renormalization of background elds and composite operators
and construct the renormalized operator of the energy-momentum tensor trace. require-
ment of quantum weyl invariance leads to eective string elds equations of motion. we
compare with each other equations of motion derived in two previous sections and show
that string theory gives (at least in the lowest order) consistent equations for the spin 2
massive eld interacting with gravity. conclusion contains summary of the results.

2 massive spin 2 eld coupled to gravity in eld the-

ory

it follows from the analysis of irreducible representations of 4-dimensional poincare group
that massive spin 2 eld in at spacetime is described by symmetric transversal and
traceless tensor of the second rank h satisfying mass-shell condition:

(cid:16)2  m2(cid:17)h = 0,

h = 0,

h 

 = 0.

(1)

in higher dimensional spacetimes poincare algebras have more than two casimir operators
and so there are several dierent spins for d > 4. talking about spin 2 massive eld in
arbitrary dimension we will mean, as usual, that this eld by denition satises the same
equations (1) as in d = 4. after dimensional reduction to d = 4 such a eld will
describe massive spin two representation of d = 4 poincare algebra plus innite tower of
kaluza-klein descendants.

it is well known that all the equations (1) can be derived from the fierz-pauli action:

s = z ddx(cid:26) 1

equations of motion following from the action (2)

can be used to build d + 1 expressions without second derivatives of h:

e = m2h  m2h = 0

m2
d  2

e + e = hm4 d  1
d  2

(2)

(3)

(5)

these expressions represent constraints on the initial values for the eld h and its rst
derivatives. thus the theory contains the same local dynamical degrees of freedom as the

4

system (1) and describes traceless and transverse symmetric tensor eld of the second
rank.

now if we want to construct a theory of massive spin 2 eld on a curved manifold we
should provide the same number of propagating degrees of freedom as in the at case. it
means that one should be able to build exactly d + 1 constraints from the equations of
motion e and in the at spacetime limit these constraints should reduce to (4,5).

generalizing (2) to curved spacetime we should substitute all derivatives for the co-
variant ones and also we can add non-minimal terms containing curvature tensor with
some dimensionless coecients in front of them. as a result, the most general action for
massive spin 2 eld in curved spacetime quadratic in derivatives and consistent with the
at limit should have the form [1]

should contain one vector constraint and one scalar constraint generalizing (4,5) for the
case of curved background.

there are no problems with generalization of the vector constraint (4). it does not
contain second derivatives of h for any gravitational background and for any values of
coecients a1, . . . a5:

e = 2a1rh + 2a2rh + 2a3r

as for the curved space generalization of the scalar constraint (5), it does contain sec-
ond derivatives. writing general form of this scalar constraint we should take into account
possible new terms proportional to curvature with some new dimensionless coecients b1,
b2 (as we shall see consistency requires these coecients to have non vanishing values):

(9)

in the last equality we decomposed the curvature tensor r into weyl tensor c,
traceless part of the ricci tensor r = r 1
d gr and scalar curvature. it is impossible
to cancel all second derivatives in (9) by xing the coecients ai since at least some
combination of the last two terms with r will always remain. so in order to achieve
consistency with the at space limit one has to impose restriction on the gravitational
background

r =

gr

(10)

d

thus cancelling bad terms with second derivatives of h in (9). this restriction is rather
loose and allows one to consider a wide class of curved backgrounds including, of course,
the case of constant curvature spacetimes. the condition (10) means that only traceless
part of ricci tensor should vanish while scalar curvature and weyl tensor can be arbitrary.
in fact, this condition can be yet more weakened because in order to achieve consistency
one should cancel in (9) only second time derivatives. for example, if we are dealing with
a stationary spacetime possessing a timelike killing vector k, k2 < 0 it is sucient to
demand:

kkr =

k2r

1
d

which means that only projection of the traceless part of r on orbits of k should vanish.
other terms with second derivatives in (9) can be cancelled by choosing appropriate
coecients. as a result, one arrives at one-parameter family of consistent theories for the
massive spin-2 elds on the spacetime fullling (10):

 is the only dimensionless coupling constant responsible for non-minimality of interaction
with curved background. this is the most general form of the action for the massive spin
2 eld in curved spacetime leading to consistent equations of motion. in previous works
[1]-[4] only the cases with various particular values of  were investigated.

note that in addition to consistency with the at space limit any eld theory should
possess one more crucial property connecting with causal propagation (for a review see
[46]). in general case interaction with gravity changes structure of the terms with highest
derivatives in lagrangian and equations of motion and so light cones describing propa-
gation of both metric and spin 2 massive eld [1]. in our case the metric g in (11) is
considered as external eld and so the nonminimal terms like rhh in the action do not
change structure of the highest (second) derivatives. second derivatives in the action (11)
coincide with those in the free action (2) and therefore describe causal propagation of the
eld h.

equations of motion and constraints have the following form:

note that consistency of the theory (in the sense that it has correct at limit) cannot be
achieved with minimal coupling to gravity. for any value of  there is non-minimal terms
in (11).

the constraints (13,14) have the simplest form when  = 1. the equations of motion

in this case reduce to:

the theory is, of course, consistent for any other values of , only explicit form of con-

is no simple way to resolve the constraints (13,14) with respect to h 
 and h for ar-
bitrary . but in the case of weak gravitational elds one can resolve them perturbatively
as series in the inverse mass square:

h =

m2(cid:19) = 0

(16)

in order to analyze specic properties of the theory (11) it would be useful to nd
some examples of gravitational backgrounds which are solutions of (10) but at the same
time are more general than metrics satisfying ordinary vacuum einstein equation with
cosmological constant

r = g.

(17)

however, at least in the classes of spherical symmetric metrics and spatial homoge-
neous metrics general solution of (10) coincides with the solutions of (17) thus giving no
new non-trivial backgrounds.

namely, consider for deniteness spherically symmetric static ansatz in d = 4:

ds2 = a(r)dt2 + b(r)dr2 + r2d2

(18)

with a, b arbitrary functions and d the solid angle. substitution of this ansatz into
(10) gives the general solution depending on two parameters c1, c2:

a =

1
b

= 1 +

c1
r

+ c2r2

(19)

which represents nothing but ads(ds)-schwarzschild metric with the constant scalar cur-
vature

r = 12c2.

this metric is also a solution of (17). it means that (10) has no new spherically symmetric
static solutions as compared to (17).

the same situation holds for spatially static homogeneous (cosmological) ansatz which
depends on one arbitrary function a(). for example, in closed universe the line element
has the form

ds2 = a2()(cid:16)d2 + d2 + sin2 d2 + sin2  sin2 d2(cid:17)

(20)

the equations (10) give

a() =

a0
sin 

,

a0 = const

8

which means that spacetime is de sitter one with the curvature

r =

12
a2
0

= const

this is also a solution of (17) and we see that in order to nd new non-trivial solutions
of (10) one should consider ansatze with less symmetry.

3 coupling to background scalar eld

one can generalize the above analysis for the case of spin 2 massive eld interacting
not only with background gravity but also with a scalar dilaton eld. this set of elds
arises naturally in string theory which contains dilaton eld (x) as one of its massless
excitations.

writing a general action similar to (11) for this system one should take into account
all possible new terms with derivatives of (x) and also containing arbitrary factors f ()
without derivatives of the dilaton elds. for example, string eective action can contain
in various terms the factors ek, k = const. we will consider here the class of actions for
the eld h where all these factors can be absorbed to the metric g by a conformal
rescaling.

the most general action of this type is

s = sg + s,

(21)

where sg is the general action without dependence on scalar eld (6) and s can contain
(up to total derivatives) ten new terms:

s = z ddxg(cid:26)c1

we consider  as a background eld on the same footing with the metric g.

what values of coupling parameters c1, . . . , c10 are permissible and how does the con-
dition on the background (10) change in the presence of ? to answer these question one
should write down generalizations of the constraints (8,9) and require absence of second
derivatives of the eld h in them.

the equations of motion are:

(25)

all new terms containing second derivatives h and the scalar eld  can be cancelled
by an appropriate choice of the coecients ci, di. namely, there remains four arbitrary
constants, let us call them 1, 2, 3, 4, all coecients being expressed in terms of these

as for the terms without dependence on , in order to cancel them one has to impose the
same restriction on the gravitational background (10) as in the previous section.

one can wonder whether it is possible to combine in (25) the terms with curvature
and the terms with  thus changing the restriction on the background (10) instead of
imposing the conditions (26). the relevant terms in the scalar constraint are

 2h(cid:26)(a5 + b2)r + (d2  c4) + (d3 + c8)(cid:27)

+ h(cid:26)(a5 + b2 + 1)r + (d2  c4) + (d3 + c8)(cid:27).

(27)

and we see that due to extra unity in the second line the only possibility is to cancel terms
with r and  separately. cancellation of terms with  can be made by the choice of
coecients (26) while terms with ricci tensor after extracting of traceless parts can be
cancelled only for gravitational background satisfying the restriction (10).

hence, the most general consistent action for the spin 2 eld interacting with back-
ground gravitational and scalar elds can be built only for metrics satisfying the condition
(10) and contains ve arbitrary constant parameters:

problems of causality are absent in this theory too because all second derivatives terms
are the same as in the free case. dilaton is treated as external eld and so terms like, for
example, hh represent some given function of coordinates times hh and do not
inuence propagation properties of the theory.

in the rest of the paper we will be considering only pure gravitational background

when the scalar eld  is absent.

4 consistent equations in arbitrary background

the condition (10) providing consistency of the theory in curved space restricts analysis
to special types of gravitational background. it is desirable to overcome this restriction
and, as we explain below, there exist at least two possible ways to do it.

1) non-lagrangian equations.
first, one can give up the idea of constructing a lagrangian for the spin 2 eld in arbi-
trary spacetime and restrict oneself to the problem of nding consistent (non-lagrangian)
equations of motion. the most general second order equations linear in curvature and
reducing in the at limit to fierz-pauli equations dier from (7) by the only coecient.
namely, instead of the two terms with coincident coecients a5 one should write them
with dierent arbitrary coecients a5rh + a6grh and to repeat for the resulted
equations the same analysis as for (9). now we will have dierent coecients a5, a6 in the
last two terms in (9) and will be able to cancel all second derivatives by means of choos-
ing specic values for a1, . . . , a6 without imposing any restriction on the gravitational
background. the resulted equations describe two-parameter family of theories:

e = 2h  g2h + h + gh  h 
h  2rh

+ 1rh  1grh + 2r
+ (1  2)grh  m2h + m2hg = 0

h + 2r

  h 



(29)

and for the background satisfying (10) they reduce to the lagrangian equations (7) with
 = d

2 1 + 2.
the constraints that can be derived from these equations are

e = 1rh  1rh + 2rh + (2  2)r

the explicit form of the constraints is rather complicated and one cannot conclude that
h is traceless and transverse like in at case. but the total number of constraints (d+1)
coincides with the at space case which is enough for consistency of the theory. moreover,
just like in the case of lagrangian equations one can resolve constraints perturbatively
when background curvature is small:

h =

1
m2

2(d  2)2 + 2  2d
h = o(cid:18) 1
m2(cid:19)

d  1

rh + o(cid:18) 1
m4(cid:19)

then in the lowest order in curvature (or, equivalently, in inverse mass square) the equa-
tions of motion become:

e = 2h + 2r





h + 1rh + 2(2  1)r

(h)

d  42 + 2  d

+

d

grh  m2h + o(cid:18) 1

m2(cid:19) = 0

(32)

note that in all cases considered so far (15), (16), (32) consistency xes the unique value
of the coecient in front of the term r

h.





2) inclusion of higher order terms in lagrangian
the mass of the eld h, being a dimensionful parameter, can be used to construct
a lagrangian with terms of arbitrary orders in curvature multiplied by the corresponding
powers of 1/m2:

sh = z ddxg(cid:26)1

(33)

actions of this kind are expected to arise naturally in string theory where the role of mass
parameter is played by string tension m2 = 1/ and perturbation theory in  will give
for background elds eective actions of the form (33) 2.

2in fact, string theory should lead to even more general eective actions than (33) since in the higher

 corrections higher derivatives of all background elds should appear.

13

possibility of constructing consistent equations for massive higher spin elds as series in
curvature was recently studied in [6] where for spin 2 eld these equations were derived in
particular case of symmetrical einstein spaces in linear in curvature order. in principle, as
we argue below consistency with the at space limit can be achieved without imposing any
restrictions on gravitational background. of course, in higher orders one should also be
careful with causality of the theory. for example, terms like 1
m2 rhh shift structure
of the second derivatives in the equations of motion and can, in principle, violate the
causality. in general, the requirement of causality should impose additional restrictions
on the parameters of the theory (see [6] for an example) but in the lowest order which we
will be considering in this paper the structure of the highest derivatives remains unchanged
and no causality problems arise.

for the action (33) vector constraint requirement e = 0 gives some restrictions on
coupling coecients appeared in new high order terms in (33). consequences of the scalar
condition (9) change more drastically. left hand side of (9) contains dierent powers of
m2 and hence contributions from terms of dierent orders in the lagrangian will mix with
each other. this removes restrictions on both the lower order coecients a1, . . . , a5 and
gravitational background. a part of coecients at higher order terms in (33) will be
determined in terms of a1, . . . , a5 from requirement that scalar combination of equations
of motion (9) do not contain second derivatives and some of them may remain arbitrary.

consider, for example, the following term in the action

b - coupling parameter. it will give the contribution to the equations of motion:

s 

1
m2 brhh,

1
m2 b(r
and thus to the scalar constraint (9):

e 

h + r

h)

m2
d  2

ge 

rh

b

d  2

comparing this with (9) we see that the coecient b (and may be some additional coe-
cients arising from 1/m2 terms in the lagrangian) should be determined by cancelling the
contribution from the lower order term proportional to a3. the coecient a3 is expected
to remain arbitrary.

anyway, in the lowest order no restriction on the coecients and gravity background

appear. equations of motion are:

e = 2h  g2h + h + gh  h 

  h

m4(cid:19)  m2h + m2hg = 0

14

1
m2 (rh + rh + rh + rrh)

(34)

now we solve perturbatively the constraints with respect to the trace and longitudinal part
of h. of course, the combinations of equations of motion e forming the constraints
can change in higher orders but this is irrelevant for the lowest order conditions. the
vector constraint arise from:

e +

1

m2 (re + re) + o(cid:18) 1

m4(cid:19) = m2h + m2h + o(1) = 0 



h  h = o(cid:18) 1
m2(cid:19)

since the trace enters the equations of motion in the term m2h we will need expansion

of the scalar constraint up to the next to leading terms:

m2

 b2i + o(1)

(35)

(36)

(38)

where in the last equality we decomposed the eld h to the sum of its trace and the
traceless part h = h. we see that in the lowest orders the expression (36) does
not contain second derivatives for any values of the coecients ai, bi and for arbitrary
background. solving it with respect to the trace we get

h =

1

m2(d  2)

r h(cid:16)(d  2)b2  2a3  2a4  da5(cid:17) + o(cid:18) 1
m4(cid:19)

(37)

providing that the coecients and scalar curvature fulll the inequality:

r(cid:16)2da1 + 2d2a2 + 2a3 + 2a4 + 2da5 + d(d  1)(d  2)b1 + (d  1)(d  2)b2(cid:17)

+ m2d(d  1) + o(cid:18) 1

m2(cid:19) 6= 0

which represents a generalization of the condition discussed for the case of massive spin
2 eld in de sitter spacetime in [2, 3].

substituting (37) back to the equations of motion we get the equations for the traceless

part:

2 h + 2a1r h + (2a3 + 2)r





 h + 2(a4  1)r

( h)

 h + o(cid:18) 1

m2(cid:19) = 0,

h

 + o(cid:18) 1

m2(cid:19) = 0.

(39)

15

mass shell condition in (39) contains in this order four non-minimal terms with curvature
tensor and coecients at all of them are arbitrary.

this arbitrariness is related to the possibility of making eld redenitions in the action
(33). it is well known [47] that in string theory such possibility allows to change eective
action for massless background elds in higher orders. in case of massive elds action
contains the mass term which is of order 1/ and this leads to possibility of changing
some coecient in the eective action already in the lowest order. namely, since (33)
contains all higher powers of 1/m2 one can redene the eld h through an innite
series as:

h  h +

1

m2(cid:18)x1r
+ o(cid:18) 1
m4(cid:19)



h + x2r



(h) + x3rh + x4grh(cid:19)

(40)

using such redenitions one can assign any values to the coecients a1, a3, a4, b2 in (39)
and so specic values of these coecients do not play any role in achieving consistency of
the theory (33). requirement of consistency will restrict parameters of the theory only
in higher orders in 1/m2.

concluding this section we would like to stress once more that the theory (33) admits
any gravitational background and so no inconsistencies arise if one treats gravity as dy-
namical eld satisfying einstein equations with the energy - momentum tensor for the
eld h. the action for the system of interacting gravitational eld and massive spin 2
eld and the einstein equations for it are:

s = se + sh,

se =

r 

1
2

gr = d2t h
,

t h

 =

1

d2 z ddxgr,

sh
g

(41)

with sh given by (33). however, making the metric dynamical we change the stucture
of the second derivatives by means of the nonminimal terms  rhh which now can
spoil causal propagation of both metric and massive spin 2 eld [1]. this will impose
extra restrictions on the parameters of the theory. also, one can consider additional
requirements the theory should fulll, e.g. tree level unitarity of graviton - massive spin
2 eld interaction [4].

5 open string theory in background of massive spin

2 eld

in this section we will consider sigma-model description of an open string interacting with
two background elds  massless graviton g and second rank symmetric tensor eld
h from the rst massive level of the open string spectrum. we will show that eective

16

equations of motion for these elds are of the form (39) and explicitly calculate all the
coecients in these equations in the lowest order in .

here ,  = 0, . . . , d  1; a, b = 0, 1 and we introduced the notation x = dx
edt . the rst
term s0 is an integral over two-dimensional string world sheet m with metric gab and the
second si represents a one-dimensional integral over its boundary with einbein e. we work
in euclidian signature and restrict ourselves to at world sheets with straight boundaries.
it means that both two-dimensional scalar curvature and extrinsic curvature of the world
sheet boundary vanish and we can always choose such coordinates that gab = ab, e = 1.
theory has two dimensionful parameters.  is fundamental string length squared, d-
dimensional coordinates x have dimension . another parameter  carries dimension
of inverse length in two-dimensional eld theory (42) and plays the role of renormalization
scale. it is introduced in (42) to make the background eld h dimensionless. in fact,
power of  is responsible for the number of massive level to which a background eld
belongs because one expects that open string interacts with a eld from n-th massive
level through the term

n() n+1

2 zm

edt x1 . . . xn+1h1...n+1(x)

the action (42) is non-renormalizable from the point of view of two-dimensional quan-
tum eld theory. inclusion of interaction with any massive background produces in each
loop an innite number of divergencies and so requires an innite number of dierent
massive elds in the action. but massive modes from the nth massive level give vertices
proportional to n and so they cannot contribute to renormalization of elds from lower
levels. of course, this argument suppose that we treat the theory perturbatively dening
propagator for x  only by the term with graviton in (42). now we will use such a scheme
to carry out renormalization of (42) dropping all the terms o(2).

varying (42) one gets classical equations of motion with boundary conditions:

with circles denoting bare values of the elds. we would like to stress once more that
higher massive levels do not inuence the renormalization of any given eld from the lower
massive levels and so the result (52) represents the full answer for perturbative one-loop
renormalization of g and h.

now to impose the condition of weyl invariance of the theory at the quantum level

we should calculate the trace of energy momentum tensor in d = 2 +  dimension:

t (z) = gab(z)

s

gab(z)

h x x.

divergencies in vacuum expectations values of the operators

< h x x >= r dx es[x]h x x

r dx es[x]

(54)

are calculated by standard background eld method with the use of normal coordinates
(44) as quantum elds.

in the one loop approximation it is enough to expand the composite operator and the
action in (54) up to second order in normal coordinates and we neglect the terms more
than linear in h as giving only contributions to renormalization of higher massive levels:

fact, einstein equations should not be vacuum ones but contain dependence on the eld
h through its energy - momentum tensor t h
. our calculations could not produce this
dependence because such dependence is expected to arise only if one takes into account
string world sheets with non-trivial topology and renormalizes new divergencies arising
from string loops contribution [41, 43]. considering this fact we can write our nal

 can

the eqs.

(63) represent a system of consistent equations of motion derived in the
lowest order but if one wants to determine whether they can be deduced from an eective
lagrangian (and to nd this lagrangian) then one-loop contributions present in (63) are
not sucient. comparing the eective equations of motion (62,63) with the general form
of equations for spin 2 eld discussed in section 2, we see that coecients e(i) arising
in the condition of string weyl invariance are not equations directly following from a
lagrangian (34) but some combinations of them similar to (39). in order to reverse the
procedure of passing from (34) to (39) one would need the next to leading contributions
in the conditions for h and h (63).

but, anyway the specic values of coecients ai in the eective action (33) are not
important due to possibility of eld redenition (40) discussed in the end of section 2.
in string theory this possibility can be also interpreted as nite renormalization of the
eld h. our result (63) has coecients specic for the minimal subtraction scheme
which we used performing the renormalization of background elds and composite oper-
ators. specic values of these coecients are scheme dependent so in case of arbitrary
renormalization scheme the rst equation in (63) will take the form:



2h + c1r
h + c2r
1
 h + o() = 0.





h + c2r

h + c3rh + c4grh

(64)

ci are coecients depending on the renormalization scheme and in this order in  all of
them can be made arbitrary by the eld redenition.

6 conclusion

let us summarize the obtained results. we investigated the problem of consistency of
the equations of motion for spin-2 massive eld in curved spacetime and found that

21

two dierent description of this eld are possible. first, for specic gravitational back-
ground satisfying (10) one can build an action leading to consistent equations including
the tracelessness and transversality conditions. another possibility (naturally arising in
string theory) consists in building the theory as perturbation series in inverse mass. in
the lowest order no problems of consistency with at space limit and causality arise and
equations of motion have the form (39).

then we calculated the equations for the massive spin-2 background eld arising in
sigma model approach to string theory from the condition of quantum weyl invariance
in the lowest order in . the explicit form of the derived equations (63) appears to
be a particular case of the general equations in eld theory (39). agreement between
string theory and eld theory is achieved if one takes into account a possibility of making
eld redenitions in the eective action which in string theory calculations corresponds
to possibility of making nite renormalization of background elds. we expect that in
general in each order in  the situation remains the same and it is possible to construct
the part of string eective action quadratic in massive background eld which should lead
to generalized mass-shell and transversality conditions.

to determine this part of the bosonic string eective action completely one should also
consider other massless background eld including the dilaton (x) and antisymmetric
tensor b(x). inclusion of dilaton will require investigation of strings with curved world
sheets and with non-vanishing extrinsic curvature on the boundary which complicates
the sigma-model calculations.
interaction with massless antisymmetric tensor will be
especially interesting in presence of a d-brane because such a system is a source of non-
commutative geometry in string theory (see [48] and references therein). in the limit when
components of b along the brane are large there should arises some non-commutative
analogue of the spin two massive eld theory and we hope to derive its explicit form in
the future.

also it would be interesting to repeat our analysis in the case of closed string which
contains at the lowest massive level the fourth rank tensor. from the eld theoretical
point of view investigation of such higher spin elds interacting with gravity will require
to generalize analysis made in the section 2 to the case of arbitrary spin elds whose
dynamics is governed by more complex lagrangians with auxiliary elds [49]. we leave
this investigation for the future work.
