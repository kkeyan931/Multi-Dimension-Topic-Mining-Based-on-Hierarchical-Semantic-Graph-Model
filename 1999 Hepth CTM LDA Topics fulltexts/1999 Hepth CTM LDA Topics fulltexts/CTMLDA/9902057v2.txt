casimir energy for spherical boundaries

calculations of the casimir energy for spherical geometries which are based on integrations of
the stress tensor are critically examined. it is shown that despite their apparent agreement with
numerical results obtained from mode summation methods, they contain a number of serious errors.
specically, these include (1) an improper application of the stress tensor to spherical boundaries, (2)
the neglect of pole terms in contour integrations, and (3) the imposition of inappropriate boundary
conditions upon the relevant propagators. a calculation which is based on the stress tensor and which
avoids such problems is shown to be possible. it is, however, equivalent to the mode summation
method and does not therefore constitute an independent calculation of the casimir energy.

in 1948 casimir [1] rst predicted that two innite parallel plates in vacuum would attract each other. this
remarkable result has its origin in the zero point energy of the electromagnetic eld. while the latter is highly
divergent, the change associated with this quantity for specic plate congurations is found to be nite and thus
in principle observable. early work to detect this small eect [2] was characterized by relatively large experimental
uncertainties which left the issue in some doubt. more recent eorts [3] have provided quite remarkable data, but are
based on a dierent geometry from that of casimir. since a rigorous theoretical calculation has never been carried out
for the latter conguration, there remains room for skepticism as to whether the casimir eect is as well established
as is frequently asserted.

the extension of casimirs result to problems with nonplanar boundaries has been of considerable interest and
fraught with diculties. it was achieved for the case of the conducting spherical shell by boyer[4] in a remarkable
but intricate calculation. his result was subsequently veried by various methods [5-7], including in particular that of
direct mode summation [8-9]. one of the methods developed in ref. 7 consisted of integrating the radial component of
the stress tensor over the bounding surface, a technique which was subsequently applied to the case of the cylinder [10],
the circle [11], and the dirichlet problem of a d-dimensional sphere [12]. in view of the increasingly wide application
of this technique, it is clearly of interest to ascertain its validity.

since the electromagnetic sphere is the only known case in which a nite casimir energy can be obtained for
a nonplanar geometry using conventional (e.g., exponential) regularization techniques, it is convenient to use this
case as a specic framework for the present work. one begins by dening the usual stress tensor for the uncoupled
electromagnetic eld

where g = (1, 1, 1, 1) and

t  = f f

with a being the usual vector potential [13]. the latter is taken most conveniently to be in the radiation gauge
kak = 0, a0 = 0. the vacuum expectation value of t  can clearly be obtained from appropriate derivatives of the
time ordered product

gij (x, t; x, t) = ih0|(ai(x, t)aj (x, t))+|0i

(2)

where the latter is to be evaluated in the presence of spherical conducting boundaries at r = a and r = r where
r = |x|. the limit r   is to be taken as the nal step of the calculation.

the dierential equation for gij

(cid:18)2 +

t2(cid:19) gij(x, t; x, t) = ij(x  x)(t  t)

with ij(x) the usual transverse delta function is to be solved for 0  r, r  a and for a  r, r  r subject to the
usual causal boundary conditions, namely positive (negative) frequencies for t  t > 0 (t  t < 0). this is an issue

1

of some importance since all previous stress tensor calculations of the casimir energy for nonplanar boundaries have
imposed outgoing wave conditions in the region exterior to the surface of interest. while causal boundary conditions
follow directly from the existence of the vacuum as the state of lowest energy, there is no way to infer outgoing wave
conditions [14] for the propagator (2).

the fourier transform of the propagator is thus inferred from the boundary conditions to have the form

gij (x, x; ) =xn

where the sum is to be taken over all normalized eigenfunctions ai

subject to appropriate boundary conditions at r = 0, a, r together with the transversality condition kak = 0. from
r  b = r  e = 0 for r = a, r where ek = f 0k and bk = 1

where the summation is to be taken over both the interior and exterior eigenmodes of the system. this sum has been
carefully evaluated in ref.9 using an exponential cuto with results entirely consistent with previous calculations.
thus it only remains to be determined whether similar conclusions follow from the stress tensor method.

to pursue this issue it is to be noted that the interpretation of t kl(x) as the k component of the force per unit

area normal to a surface l comes from the k component of the conservation law

thus

t  = 0.

where the integration on the rhs is to be taken over the surface  which bounds the volume v . since the lhs is the
time rate of change of the k component of the momentum, it can then be claimed that t kl(x) is the correct force per
unit area so long as the calculation is performed in cartesian coordinates. however, the claim has been made [7,10-12]
that it is also valid in spherical coordinates, i.e., that the force per unit area f/a on the spherical surface is simply
given by

f/a = h0|[trr(r = a  )  trr(r = a + )]|0i.

(6)

this, of course, is an assertion which can be examined by direct calculation, a task to which attention is now directed.

ln refers to the internal eigenfrequencies. the corresponding result for h0|trr(r = a + )|0i is simply obtained
from (6) by using the corresponding external eigenmodes together with the replacements f <  f > and g<  g>.
in order to relate this result to the mode summation method, however, an explicit construction of the relevant
eigenfunctions is required. for the interior region r  a the normalization of the functions f <

in agreement with the claim of [7]. however, for the exterior of the sphere there is, of course, a contribution only from
r = a while the normalization depends upon both a and r, a circumstance which in fact prevents one from obtaining
a result analogous to (8). to see this it is convenient to go to manifestly normalized forms by the replacements

since the coecients (1,2)
vanish in the large r limit, it follows that this implies a suppression of the contribution
of the external modes in the calculation of the casimir energy,thereby contradicting eq.(8). thus the stress tensor
approach does not constitute a valid approach to this problem for the case of spherical boundaries. similar conclusions
are readily obtained for dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions.

ln

although the conclusions reached here have been based on a very specic calculation, they can be placed in a more
general context by using techniques of covariant dierentiation. to this end one takes the conservation law for t 
in the form

where use has been made of the tracelessness of t . since h0|t r0|0i is time independent and h0|t r|0i = h0|t r|0i =
0, it follows that

and consequently

z drdr(r3h0|t rr|0i) =z r2drdh0|t 00|0i,

r3h0|trr(r)|0i|r2

(11)

for arbitrary r1 and r2. this clearly shows that the correct inference to be drawn from (10) is not the force equation
(6) but rather the fact that the dierence between the quantities r3h0|trr(r)|0i when evaluated on the two bounding
spherical surfaces is proportional to the total energy in that region.

it should also be noted that this result can also be inferred directly from the cartesian tensor result

which implies that

lh0|t kl|0i = 0.

xklh0|t kl|0i = lxkh0|tkl|0i  h0|t kk|0i

= 0.

upon using once again the tracelessness of the energy momentum tensor eq.(11) clearly follows.

it has been noted here that many of the existing calculations of the casimir eect for a sphere have not used correct
boundary conditions on the underlying propagators. more serious is the fact that those which have used the stress
tensor method have applied an approach which fails in its application to nonplanar boundaries. in concluding this
work it needs to be pointed out that there exists yet a third failure in many of these calculations. to illustrate this
point it is convenient to refer to eq.(3.14) of ref.[7] which gives the casimir energy as

degree rotation of the contour. however, for the case of the exterior mode part of ec such a rotation fails since it
does not take into account the existence of poles of the hankel functions in the lower half plane. this is a noteworthy
reminder of the remarks made earlier concerning the fact that the outgoing spherical wave condition for r > a cannot
be derived for casimir propagators.

having displayed some of the problems associated with the calculation of the casimir energy for the case of spherical
boundaries it is of interest to note that calculations which employ the stress tensor method claim to obtain the same
result as that found by direct mode summation. this issue is dealt with in an appendix which shows that when
appropriate attention is paid to the issue of contour rotation one does not in fact obtain the usual result.

appendix

it has been stated in this work that the discontinuity in the stress tensor across a boundary cannot be used to
calculate the casimir pressure on that surface. since, however, such calculations invariably claim to obtain the usual
result, it is of considerable interest to display explicitly the aw in such calculations. in order to avoid inessential
complications one can choose to deal only with trr(r = a + ) for the case of the te modes with corresponding results
for trr(r = a  ) and for the tm modes then following immediately. this is, of course, equivalent to considering
the scalar eld case with dirichlet boundary conditions. for this case one nds in analogy to [7] and [12] that the
relevant greens function is obtained by solving the equation

subject to dirichlet boundary conditions at r = a, r. upon writing

g(x, x; ) =

and

l (r) = jl(r)nl(r)  jl(r)nl(r).

this allows the partial wave greens function to be written in the form

gl(r, r; ) =

using the fact that the zeros of the wronskian determine the eigenmodes of the system gl(r, r; t  t) is found to be

where the sum is taken over all eigenmodes of the system corresponding to eigenfrequencies ln. this form of the
propagator is recognizable as the fourier transform of the scalar version of (3) with explicitly normalized eigenfunc-
tions. an immediate consequence is that the calculation of casimir energy by direct mode summation can now be
carried out using the approach of [9] to obtain the usual result. in addition the analysis following eq.(9) can be
repeated, again nding that there is no contribution to h0|trr(r = a + )|0i in the large r limit.

although this would seem to establish the inapplicability of the stress tensor method, it is instructive to continue
the analysis to determine exactly at what point the latter method fails. to this end one notes that the evaluation of
h0|trr(r = a+ )|0i requires that derivatives with respect to both r and r be taken at r = r = a and an integration be
performed over . since the eigenmodes occur at real values of , the path of integration must be carefully specied.

as deduced from the boundary conditions (and also as stated clearly in [7]) the appropriate path is just above (below)
the real axis for  > 0 ( < 0). the usual expression for the casimir force is then obtained if (a) the contour can
be rotated ninety degrees counterclockwise and (b) if f >
(a)
(h(2)
(a)) in the upper (lower) half plane in the large r limit. although the second condition (b) is satised, giving a
r independent result which is formally identical to the usual expression for the casimir energy, it is easy to see that
the required contour rotation cannot be performed. to display this result one writes

while it is clear that the segment of the contour from  =  to  = 0 can be rotated counterclockwise to the
negative imaginary axis, no such rotation is possible for the segment  = 0 to  =  [16]. conversely, in the case
that the stress tensor is dened by the limit t = t   rather than t = t + , it becomes possible to rotate that part of
the contour along the positive real axis to the positive imaginary axis. this choice, however, precludes the possibility
of a legitimate rotation of the contour along the negative real axis. this completes the proof that the stress tensor
does not in fact yield the usual expression for the casimir stress on the sphere. the demonstration in the body of this
paper was based on the method of expansion in eigenfunctions and in this appendix on the wronskian formulation
of the greens function, the latter being the one more commonly used in published calculations of the stress tensor.
the results of the two approaches are identical (note the remark [16]) and show that stress tensor calculations in
curvilinear coordinates cannot be expected to yield the correct casimir energy.
