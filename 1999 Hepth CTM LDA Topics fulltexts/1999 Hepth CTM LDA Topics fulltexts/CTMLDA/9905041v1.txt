abstract

new string dynamics is formulated on the basis of the extended
set of supergauge constraints including not only supergauge vira-
soro conditions but also nilpotent supercurrent constraints . this
approach arises from a natural generalization of the classical oper-
ator many-string vertices. the formulation of this model leads to
three two-dimensional surfaces for description of hadron strings. it
gives some dynamical generalization of chan-paton factor for string
amplitudes in terms of operator vertices. supersymmetry on the 2-d
world surface is present but ten-dimensional supersymmetry is ab-
sent. in this approach two-dimensional fermion string elds make it
possible to give a unied description of hadron and lepton degrees of
freedom and of its dynamics. this model allows to solve the prob-
lem of elimination of the most part of parity twins in the baryon
spectrum.

one-loop (and many-loops perhaps) amplitudes in this model are
nite due to the extended set of supergauge constraints and to the
signicant excess of the total number of fermion two-dimensional
elds over the number of boson 2-d elds.

1 introduction

in spite of signicant success in treatment of hadron interactions of high
energy the quantum chromodynamics (qcd) up to now is unable to give
a consistent quantitative description of most strong interactions up to 2-5
gev, that is to say of soft hadron interactions. chiral models [1, 2] are
enough eective for small energies of light hadrons (< 300mev ). however
the chiral approach solely is incapable to describe the resonance region of
hadron interactions in a consistent way.

hm 2; (

attempts to build string-based hadron amplitudes have been undertaken
at dawn of the age of string theory (dual resonance models) [3]. they were
initiated by the remarkable universal linearity of the regge trajectories for
spins of meson and baryon resonances j = (m 2) = (0) + 
h 
0, 85gev 2). now we have these trajectories up to j = 5. from this point
of view the  -trajectory with (0) = 1/2 turns out to be the leading hadron
trajectory. up to now there is no other satisfactory explanation of the strik-
ing linearity of hadron regge trajectories than a stringlike form of hadrons.
this hadron string approach was very encouraging with respect to the few
particles amplitudes (   for example ) in good agreement with ex-
perimental data and the chiral limit. but many-particles amplitudes and
loop corrections found then proved to break down unitarity. all further
consistent string amplitudes for many particles have to include massless
vector mesons in the resonance spectrum in order for unitarity require-
ments to be satised. they correspond to the  -trajectory with (0) = 1.
it is in obvious contradiction with the hadron spectrum observed exper-
imentally. development of this string approach with the leading regge
trajectory (m 2) = j = 1 + m 2 has led to the usual superstring the-
ory [4] for interactions of quarks, gluons and gravitons at planck distances
(  
hm 2 was
realized by lovelace and shapiro in the amplitude for    [5]. it cor-
responds to the correct chiral limit and to the adler- weinberg condition
[6]. a few years ago a consistent generalization of lovelace-shapiro ampli-
tudes for arbitrary number of pions with the leading trajectory (m 2) =
hm 2 has been found [7, 8]. new many-pions amplitudes do not
j = 1/2 + 
contradict unitarity.

p  1038gev 2) beyond reach of experiment.

the initial case with the -trajectory (m 2) = j = 1/2 + 

second diculty of the string approach to hadron interactions was to de-

2

scribe hadron scattering at large angles for high energies s and high transfer
momenta t. it may appear that there is an exponential decrease for string
amplitudes here in obvious contradiction with experimental data and the
parton picture. however discovery of sister traectories [9] has proved this
exponential fallo to be reduced up to a power dependence owing to con-
tributions of many particles states. moreover as we shall see further both
fundamental values of the slope : the hadronic 
h and the extreme small
planck 
p for closed strings are possible in this model. thus this obsta-
cle was been overcome and this argument against string interpretation of
hadrons has lost its strength too.

so the main problem for the string approach to hadrons is to combine re-
quirements of unitarity and the intercept of the leading hadron trajectory to
be equal one half (instead of the traditional value to be equal one in the case
of classical superstring theories). the absence of ghosts (states with nega-
tive norm) in the spectrum of physical states in traditional string models
is provided by the virasoro supergauge constraints to be satised. in turn
the fulllment of the virasoro conditions usually leads to the intercept of
the leading regge trajectory for mesons to be equal one and the presence of
massless vector mesons in the resonance spectrum correspondingly. a pos-
sible solution of this problem on the basis of some natural generalization of
many-string operator vertices (n-reggeon vertices [10]) was suggested in [8].
in this model the physical hadron spectrum does not consist massless vector
states and the leading regge trajectory for mesons has the intercept to be
equal one half. it proves to be possible due to a new functional approach
to string amplitudes. this construction includes some cyclic functional in-
tegration which generalizes traditional one and generates natural structure
of the harari-rosner quark dual diagrams [11] for string amplitudes. sec-
ond new attribute of this model is nilpotent supercurrent gauge constraints
apart from usual virasoro supergauge ones. the previous formulation of
this approach in [7] is not suciently advanced to deduce consistent super-
current constraints and vertices which will satisfy requirements of unitarity.
a new modication to be considered here allows to obtain necessary con-
straints and operator vertices. furthermore two-dimensional elds of this
model are capable of describing all hadron and lepton degrees of freedom
and its interactions.

2 fermion two-dimensional elds, functional
formulation of the model and virasoro su-
pergenerators

two-dimensional elds of the model are represented by two sets. first set
includes usual elds of the neveu-schwarz model [12]: the string coordinate
x() and its fermion superpartner h(),  = 0, . . . , d  1, d = 10;  are
coordinates on two-dimensional world surface. second set includes new two-
dimensional fermion elds: () and a(). new elds   = 1, . . . 32 are
spinor elds in ten-dimensional target space (compare with the bardakci-
halpern model [13, 14]). other elds a are two-dimensional fermion elds
which carry quantum numbers of all currents ja composed from : j ()
a =
a.
it is easy to nd the number of independent matrices a and of
corresponding elds a. we obtain this number to be equal 32 31/2 = 496
due to the anticommutation of  elds. actually this model includes two
sets of new elds as we shall see below. new two-dimensional fermion elds
provide a way of obtaining the following results:

1) unied description of all quark avours and lepton degrees of freedom;
2) consistent from viewpoint of unitarity tree amplitudes for n hadrons

due to a new operator construction of these amplitudes;

3) nite one loop (and many loops perhaps) corrections for open strings
due to the signicant excess of the number of fermion two-dimensional elds
over the number of boson elds (including brst elds).

let us remind that the divergence of an amplitude a1 for one loop planar
n-particle diagram in the sector of open strings is dened by integral over
the variable x = x1x2 . . . xn of f (x) near x = 1. for x  1 this function
behaves in the following manner:

f (x)  r exp c(d  d)/(1  x).
here d is the number of boson elds, d is the number of fermion two-

dimensional elds;
xi are the chan variables;
r(x) is some power function for x  1. we have d = d for usual su-
perstring approach and d  d = 25(25+1)
= 512 for the model under
consideration.

c = 2

6 ;

2

it is worth attention that an nonzero value of the one loop amplitude to

4

be given by integral to be considered may be anomal small in this model
due to the factor r exp c(d  d)/(1  x).
now we dene relations between the real quantum numbers and the
components of the  and  elds. it is convenient to represent 32 compo-
nents of  as  components. here  = 1, 2, 3, 4 is the usual dirac index;
 = 1, 2;  = 1, 2;  = 1, 2 are three isotopic indices which are corresponding
to internal quantum numbers and give us eight isotopic components.

we suppose that six additional dimensions form a at six-dimensional
compact space with enough small sizes and with global asymmetry which
corresponds to the real world.

it is suitable to build 32  32 matrices in this model in accordance with
the  components as direct product of the 4  4 dirac matrices in the
majorana representation and the 8  8 isotopic matrices.

here we shall give the functional denition of the tree amplitudes of this
approach. this representation generalizes the usual functional approach and
proves to be the direct conseqence of generalization of many-string operator
vertices in papers [7, 8].

at rst let us introduce some continual generalization of usual multipli-

cation of matrices.

let f12((1); (2)) be a functional of functions () and () on
two-dimensional world surfaces  and  which depends on two xed points
1 and 2.

now we consider the functional integral

w ( (1); (3)) = z d exp is()f12( (1); (2))f23((2); (3)) (1)

( where s() is an action for string elds ())
as a continual generalization of multiplication of two matrices

wn1n3 = pn2 fn1n2fn2n3.

correspondingly we consider the following multiple functional integral

ct rf12f23f34 . . . fn 1 = z d1 exp is(1)z d2 exp is(2) . . .

z dn exp is(n )f12(1; 2)f23(2; 3)f34(3; 4) . . . fn 1(n ; 1) (2)

as a continual generalization of the trace of the product of n matrices.

n-particles string amplitudes for [7] are presented by the usual func-

tional integral r dgdxdh exp is(x, h, g) and a continual trace ct r of

the product of vertices vi,i+1:

an = z d21z d22 . . .z d2n u(1, 2 . . . , n )

vn 1(n (n ), n (n ); x(n ), h(n ); 1(n ), 1(n ))

vertices of our model are choosing to have a simple symmetry:

vij(i, i; x, h; j, j) = vij(j, j; x, h; i, i)

(4)

(5)

from here on we shall consider tree string amplitudes in the framework of
the operator approach which allow us to obtain the necessary consistent de-
scription of superconformal constraints and corresponding vertex operators
which satisfy these constraints. as usually tree amplitudes of interaction of
n strings are represented by some integrals of vacuum expectation values
of the product of corresponding operator vertices:

an = z nyi=1

dzit rh0|v12v23...vn 1|0i

(6)

for superstring approach operator vertices have the form of commutators
with virasoro supergenerators:

vi,i+1(zi) = zl0

(8)

the momentum of the physical state pi,i+1 is separated into two parts: the
momentum ki  ki+1 which corresponds to the new set of two-dimensional
elds and corresponding surfaces and the momentum qi,i+1. the last mo-
ment corresponds to usual two-dimensional ns-surface.
in the sector of
open strings:

pi,i+1 = (ki  ki+1) + qi,i+1;
qi,i+1 = (ki + ki+1)

(sf ) = |0()ih0()| is the projector onto zero occupation numbers of
modes of  and  elds. it is evidently that namely the projector (sf )
and separation of ;  and ; -modes bring amplitudes (5) with vertices
(6,7,8) in correspondence with (3,4). now we consider the construction of
the virasoro generators of the superconformal algebra for this model.

[7, 8] is an inclusion of special 32  32 matrices  in the linear parts sf

. it reminds introduction of 5 and 
in the supergenerators fn of the ramond model [15]. so vertex operators
become matrix operators and then corresponding amplitudes are able to
reproduce the structure of the dual quark harari-rosner diagrams and the
chan-paton factor [16] in the natural way. the matrix () provides a sep-
aration of hadron and nonhadron regge trajectories in their slopes . to
be more precise we suppose some universale slope for hadron trajectories
and some very small slope for nonhadron regge trajectories in the born
approximation.

due to these commutation relations additional matrix components 2
d
arise in the operator l0 from linear parts dd of operators gsf . they
do not vanish on vacuum states and hence will break down the crossing
symmetry and duality of string amplitudes. we regain these simmetries by
way of a natural generalization of the matrix parts of operators gr. we
shall modify somewhat matrix terms of gr in order for the operator l0 to
be vanished while acting on the vacuum state. with this aim in mind we
introduce operators to be similar to zeroth modes of the elds  . here
we do not consider relation between these modes and a symmetry of the
compact space of six-dimensional torus. we hope to discuss this point in
future.

this modication does not change the superconformal algebra of oper-
ators gr considered above and the conditions of nilpotency of the brst
charge but provides for vanishing of l0 on vacuum states, crossing symme-
try and permits to bring string amplitudes of our model in accordance with
the quark dual diagrams.

let us introduce some local multiplication  and  currents:

these results can be obtained as corresponding operator products:

(+)i()()(+)j()()  (+)ij()()

where

()  |0()ih0()|

is the projector onto zero occupation numbers of the  modes. and we can
wright down similar expressions for - modes.

now it is possible to formulate our meson amplitudes an by entering
, -modes in operator vertices (7,8,13,14) and replacing the operator (sf )
by the product (sf )()() in the expression (13). the cyclic operator
trace for  and -modes generalizes the chan-paton factor in a natural way.
for example let us consider the following expression:

tn = h0|()w1()(+)w2()(+)w3() . . .

(+)wn 1()(+)wn (+)|0i

this product turns into the traditional chan-paton factor in the simplest
case of matrices i() instead of wi:

h0|()1()(+)2()()(+)3()() . . .

(+)n 1()()(+)n (+)|0i  t r(123 . . . n )

3 nilpotency of the brst -charge operator

and the supercurrent conditions

so we have the additional central charge c = d(d + 1)/2 in the virasoro
superalgebra of gr and ln operators owing to the new elds  and . there
is a need to have new additional gauge symmetries in order that one can
compensate this new central charge by the corresponding central charge of
brst -ghosts and obtain the nilpotency of the brst -charge operator.

there are some indications of existence of such symmetries in appearence
of a great many currents to be conserving on the mass shell in the bardakci-
halpern string model [14]. moreover there are evidences for these symme-
tries in the very approach under consideration.
indeed it turns out that
the operators lsf
in this model may be written in sugavara form [17] as
n
n =: pa,l j a
l j a
: where j a
lsf
r}. in general case the sugavara
l
form to be a normal product of current constituents contains nonsingular
four-fermion components after its expansion in normal products in relation
to fermion constituents. however here as in [7, 8] all these four-fermion
components are cancelled and the operators lsf
n acquire usual form of the

neveu-schwarz model operators. the scalar product pa j a( )j a( ) has a

l = {glr, a

13

l+n + ll,na,b,

ni = 0.

ni = fabcj c

symmetry in relation to rotations of vectors j. these rotations are gener-
ated by some linear combination j of the very currents. by virtue of the
commutation relations:
hj a
l , j b
invariance of the operator expression pa j a( )j a( ) with respect to these
rotations will take place in the case that second anomalous term in the
commutation relations will be absent for this combination j i.e.
h j s
n, j s
this situation reminds two-dimensional models with four-fermion inter-
action [18]. these models may obey similar symmetries and in this case ones
have the spectrum of physical states of a free model. it corresponds to our
commutation relations which are valid for free elds. on other hand these
new elds  and  lead to new states of negative norm ( ghosts). so the
additional symmetries are necessary for new ghost states to be vanished
as unitarity requires. due to the superconformal symmetry of our model
new current gauge conditions to be generated by the operators j must be
accompanied by fermion conditions to be generated by elds  which are

superpartners of j: l r = ngrl, jlo.

n and (i)

it is easy to nd the number n of necessary additional supercurrent con-
straints from the nilpotency brst-charge : 2 = 0. we have previous
brst-ghost elds of the dimensionality j to be equal 2 and 3/2 for ln and
gr correspondingly. now new brst-ghost elds of the dimensionality j to
be equal 1 and 1/2 for n new j (i)
(i = 1 . . . , n) constraints have to
be added. the contribution of the brst-ghost eld of the dimensionality
j to central charge is equal to (3(2j  1)2  1). the sign is determined by
the statistics of the brst-ghost eld. let us denote the number of boson
matter string elds by d and the number of fermion elds by d. then
we obtain rst condition of the nilpotency brst-charge from the require-
ment of the total central charge to be vanished: d+ d
2 26+112nn = 0
for d = 10, d = 10 + 32 + 32  31/2 we get n=88. in the case of the

arbitrary even dimensionality of d we have

r

d = d + 2d/2(2d/2 + 1)/2

here 2d/2 is the number of spinor components of ; 2d/2(2d/2  1)/2 is
the number of currents from these spinor components. this condition gives
possible values of d: d = 6(mod(4)); d = 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, ....

14

second condition of the nilpotency 2 = 0 requires l0 = 1/2 on physical

states. due to the additional terms (pc,d cd((+) c())2 and
(pc,d cd((+) c())2 in l0 this condition does not lead now to j = 1 +

m 2 for leading hadron regge trajectory and does not require m 2
correspondingly.

 = 0

third nontrivial condition from 2 = 0 results in norms of the  to be
vanished. and as consequence the norms of the currents j are to be vanished
too. in its turn it brings to the requirement of the vanishing corresponding
killing metrics g(ij) for group space of j :

r, s

li = 0, n s

h j s
ro = 0
l , j s
g(ij) = pkl fiklfjlk = 0 ; h j i
l , j j

ni = f ijk j k

l+n

now we shall dene current operators j (s) for our nilpotent supercurrent
conditions on the basis of general requirements found above. in order to
explain the proposed choice of j we shall consider more simple case [19]:
d = 6; the eld  is an eight-component spinor,  = 1, 2, 3, 4 is an usual
dirac index,  = 1, 2 is an isotopic index.

we take the eld k to be corresponding to the matrix:

k = k/k2  i = 0  i

and then we can choose the required elds  for supercurrent conditions

as the elds to be determined by the matrices k
i :

k
i = (i + k)i

here i are matrices which anticommute with k:

i = 5  i; i = 1, 2, 3;
j = j  i ; j = 1, 2, 3 ;
ni,j, ko = 0 we suppose here k/k2 = 0.

matrices ki,j anticommute with p too. but they do not bring to new

matrices k
i .

i the currents j k

corresponding to k

i transfer the  components with
eigenvalue of operator k to be equal -1 into other  components with the
same eigenvalue of parity. components of  = t0  0  2 have eigen-
values of k which are opposite to eigenvalues of  components by virtue of
antisymmetry of the k matrix. ( we use in our approach matrices  in the

15

majorana representation.) namely from k =  we have k =  .
in this simple case the number of corresponding nondiagonal transitions is
i = 0 commutators of operators  and
equal to n = 4  3/2 = 6. since k
j are vanished and we have
n = ngnr, i
j i

ro , i = 1, 2...6 ; h jn, jni = 0

i k

we note that full current operators j i

n dened above contain the jkfijk

terms besides i components.

let us choose operators j in our model in a similar way. from point of
view of necessary exclusion of ghost components and quantum numbers
of observed states the most appropriate operator which gives eigenvalues
for transitions corresponding to currents j is the parity operator jp . the
operator p for the current jp corresponds to the matrix p :

p =

p
  i  i  i

(27)

here  = p 2.
now we shall choose 66 current operators j by using eigen values of
 ngr, (p )ro for

 quark components in relation to the operator jp = 2
corresponding transitions. the eld p corresponds to the matrix p . the
spinor eld  has 24 components of upper and lower quarks. from them 12
components have the eigenvalue of jp to be equal +1 and the other 12 com-
ponents have the opposite eigenvalues to be equal -1. by taking transitions
between the latter components we obtain 12  11/2 = 66 transitions and 66
corresponding operators j for quarks. the matrices for these transitions
are analogical to the above ones

qp = (i + (q)
i

p )qiq;

niq, (q)

p o = 0

(q)
p = p q

(28)

(29)

(30)

in the same way 8 lepton components of  can be divided in relation
p to

to the eigenvalues of j (p )into 4 components with the eigen value of j (l)

16

be equal +1 and 4 ones with the eigen value to be equal -1. hence we have
here 4  3/2 = 6 operators to be corresponded transitions from components
 with the eigen value of j (l)
p to be equal -1 into ones with the same eigen
value and 6 currents j.

lp = (i + (l)
i

p )lil;

nil, (l)

p o = 0

(l)
p = p l

(31)

(32)

(33)

now we shall choose the remaining 16 operators j as corresponding

components of :

(i + p ) = (i +

p
  i  i  i) = (i  p )

(34)

in all, we have chosen 66+6+16=88 operators j required for the super-

current constraints.

it is easy to see that all commutators of the 88 operators of three sets
are vanished and give the vanishing corresponding killing metrics g(ij). all
these operators have vanishing norm. thus all requirements of the nilpo-
tency of the brst charge are satised for this choice of supercurrent con-
straints. this choice is quite denite and natural but it can not pretend
to the uniqueness. it is interesting to note that the number of operators
j is equal to 88 only for given division of 32  components into 24 quark
components and 8 lepton ones. other divisions lead to other values of the
number of operators j .

similarly we choose j i

n- and i

r -constraints replacing ; ; - operators

by ; ; -operators in the expressions considered above.

as discussed above we are guided by properties of the real physical states
and the requirements of the generalized algebra of gauge constraints i.e. the
virasoro superalgebra with the nilpotent supercurrent conditions.

a wave function of physical state is determined by the expression:

|p hysi = g 1

2|wphysi

17

(35)

so our constraints on the wave function of physical state are expressed

by the following equations:

(gn s

r + gsf

r + gsf 

r

)|wphysi = 0;

(ln s

n + lsf

n + lsf

it is worth noting that the evidence of the conditions mentioned above
for physical states in tree amplitudes can be obtained with help of the ex-
pansion of unity for given channel as it was made in previous version [7]
with the inclusion into consideration of elds operators to be superuous for
given channel. in doing so it is necessary at rst to separate states gener-
ated by nilpotent supercurrent operators, then states generated by virasoro
supergenerators with r, n > 1/2, then states generated by superuous for
given channel operators and at last by virasoro supergenerators with r=1/2.

4 fermion states and elimination of the most
part of parity twins from the baryon spec-
trum

the supercurrent conditions (39) conne essentially choice of fermion phys-
ical states and eliminate the most part of parity twins from the fermion
spectrum of physical states due to the projector (i  p ) in the operator
(34).
it is necessary to nd the formulation of proper operator vertices which
satisfy these supercurrent constraints in fermion channels. the direct inclu-
sion of the projector on eigen values +1 of the current jp is not compatible

18

with analiticity owing to presence in jp the singular function  = p 2.
we can to avoid this obstacle by replacing  = p 2 with an equivalent
nonsingular operator expression which does not break down the virasoro
conditions. for this purpose we introduce an additional dependence of some
angle i in operator vertices vi(zi) and corresponding integration over these
angles from 0 to 2. this construction is similar to the operator vertex for
emission of an usual closed string state [21]:

vi,i+1(zi; i) = r r

these operators r and r have half-integer and integer eigen values, the

operator r  r has integer eigen values only.

some possible solution of the problem of the parity twins. here the most
of the parity twins appear to be spurious gauge states excluded from the
spectrum of the physical states.

linear terms of the supergauge conditions
and fundamental interactions

r = g(0)sf

now we shall dene more precisely linear in elds terms in the operator gn s
and in the operator gsf
. their detailed form determines
vertex operators for amplitudes of interaction of particles and our approach
in description of fundamental interactions to a great extent. let us note that
our treatment of gauge supercurrent nilpotent conditions and formulation
of linear terms here dier essentially from previous versions [7, 20, 22].

we have rigorous commutation conditions for these linear terms noted
above in second section. these requirements of commutations give the
following equations for corresponding matrices:

hc, ci = 0;hd, ()i = 0;hcm

 , cm

 i = 0;hd, cm

 i = 0;hcm

 , ()i = 0.

these commutation relations are necessary for conservation of the form of
commutators of gr. these constraints and the lorentz covariance restrict
signicantly a choice of possible matrices c, cm
and elds d. we shall


20

determine elds d by matrices d which enter in the part dd of the
operator gsf
d which appear in l0 to be
commuting with the operator jp so these elds d will be consistent with
the new supercurrent constraints.

r with d. we take the operators j 2

this choice of suitable matrices cm

 provides a possibility of electromag-
netic and weak fundamental interactions due to vector mesons arrising in
nonplanar one-loop amplitudes (closed string sector) in addition to usual
tensor particles (gravitons). their generalized ten-dimensional masses are
vanished but usual four-dimensional masses are nonzero for w and z-

bosons. let us remind that the momentum p = pi pi,i+1 is separated into

two parts:

xi

pi,i+1 = xi

(ki  ki+1) +xi
i+1 = 2; qi,i+1 = (ki + ki+1); 2 

qi,i+1;

k2
i = k2

(48)

corresponds to the usual two-dimensional ns-surface. in the closed string

the momentum pi(kiki+1) corresponds to the new sets of two-dimensional
elds (; ) on new two-dimensional surfaces. the momentum pi qi,i+1
sector pi(ki  ki+1) is vanished and there are here the momentum p =
pi qi,i+1 = pi ki only. hence the regge trajectory for the closed string

sector takes the following form :

instead of

q > 1

now we consider linear terms for operators to be accompaning compact
components of momentum. in order to obtain necessary number of lepton
and quark types we extend our set of the  and  - modes correspondingly
and introduce a triple set of a; a; a = 1, 2, 3.

this choice gives an appropriate equivalent of colour quark degrees of
freedom and a possibility for three generations of leptons. let us to write
