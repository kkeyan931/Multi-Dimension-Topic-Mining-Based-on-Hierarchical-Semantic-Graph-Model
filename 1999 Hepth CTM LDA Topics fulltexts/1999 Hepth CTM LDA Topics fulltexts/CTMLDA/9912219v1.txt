abstract

the construction of the known interacting quantum eld theory
models is mostly based on euclidean techniques. the expectation val-
ues of interesting quantities are usually given in terms of euclidean
correlation functions from which one should be able to extract informa-
tion about the behavior of the correlation functions of the minkowskian
counterpart.

we think that the c*-algebraic approach to euclidean eld theory
gives an appropriate setup in order to study structural aspects model
independently. a previous paper deals with a construction scheme
which relates to each euclidean eld theory a poincare covariant quan-
tum eld theory model in the sense of r. haag and d. kastler.

within the framework of r. haag and d. kastler, the physical
concept of pct symmetry and spin and statistics is related to the
tomita-takesaki theory of von neumann algebras and this important
aspects has been studied by several authors.

we express the pct symmetry in terms of euclidean reexions
and we explicitly identify the corresponding modular operator and the
modular conjugation of the related tomita-takesaki theory. locality,
wedge duality, and a geometric action of the modular group of the von
neumann algebra of observables, localized within a wedge region in
minkowski space, are direct consequences.

1 introduction

concerning the know examples for non-free quantum eld theory mod-
els, the construction of them, by means of euclidean techniques, is the
most successful method which is known. not surprisingly, most of
the interesting quantities of such a model are explicitly given only in
terms of euclidean correlation functions. it is therefore natural to ask
the following question:

given a euclidean eld theory from which a quantum eld theory
can be constructed. which properties of the quantum eld theory can
directly read o from the euclidean data?

this motivates the development of tools which analyze structural
aspects of euclidean eld theories in a systematic manner and we think
that the c*-algebraic approach of euclidean eld theory gives an ap-
propriate setup in order to follow this program. analogously to the
famous osterwalder-schrader theorem [27], it can be shown [28] that
to each euclidean eld theory, formulated in the c*-algebraic frame-
work, a quantum eld theory model in the sense of r. haag and d.
kastler [21, 22] can be associated. we give a brief description of the
corresponding construction scheme later.

based on this work, a tool for investigating the high energy behav-
ior of a quantum eld theory model, by only looking at its euclidean
counterpart, has already been discussed in [30]. compared to the scal-
ing limit analysis of d. buchholz and r. verch [8, 9, 10, 11, 12] one
nds the expected results, namely that the high energy behavior of the
euclidean model reects the high energy behavior of the corresponding
quantum eld theory.

in addition to that, the c*-algebraic point of view provides new
strategies for constructing euclidean eld theory models, as it is laid
out in [29, 31].

within the framework of algebraic quantum eld theory, the phys-
ical concept of pct symmetry and spin and statistics is deeply linked
to the tomita-takesaki theory of von neumann algebras and has been
studied in several papers, see for example [2, 3, 4, 20, 25, 36, 35, 5, 7].
moreover, tomita-takesaki theory might also be important for con-
structive purposes as it is, for example, proposed in [32].

from the point of view of eulidean eld theory, it would be desirable
to express the modular data of a wedge algebra of the quantum eld
theoretical counterpart directly in terms of euclidean correlation func-
tions. this might be of importance, since according to the discussion
in [32], there is hope, that an analysis of the modular data related to
the euclidean eld theory models, which are constructed in [29, 31] by
an abstract procedure, can be used as a tool in order to decide whether
a theory describes interaction.

organization of the paper.
in the second part of the present
section, we make some preliminary remarks on the algebraic approach
to euclidean eld theory in order to introduce notations and conven-
tions which are used. starting from a given euclidean eld, we present
in section 2 the main results which state in particular that the square-
root of the modular operator of a wedge algebra of the quantum eld
theory, constructed from the euclidean data, can explicitly be identi-
ed with a particular euclidean rotation with rotation angle s = .
furthermore, the corresponding modular conjugation is a pct sym-
metry which can be expressed in terms of euclidean reexions. we
close the paper by section 3, mentioning some work in progress. we
feel obliged to postpone most of the technical details and the proofs to
the appendix in order to keep the paper more readable.

preliminary remarks on the algebraic approach to eu-
clidean eld theory. the starting point within the c*-algebraic
approach to euclidean eld theory is a so called euclidean net of c*-
algebras (b, ). such a net is an inclusion preserving prescription
u 7 b(u )  b, which assigns to each bounded convex region u in
rd a c*-algebra b(u ). this assignment has to fulll several assump-
tions, according to physical principles.

two operators commute if they are localized in disjoint regions,
more specically, if the intersection u1  u2 =  is empty, then the
commutator [b1, b2] = 0 vanishes for all operators b1  b(u1) and
b2  b(u2). the net u 7 b(u ) is euclidean covariant, i.e. there
exists a group homomorphism  form the euclidean group into the
automorphism group of b such that for a euclidean transformation
h  e(d) the algebra of a local region u is mapped, via h, onto the
algebra of the transformed region hu : hb(u ) = b(hu ).

we have to mention that, although the analogy between the c*-
algebraic approach to euclidean eld theory and the haag-kastler
framework for quantum eld theory is obious, the euclidean c*-algebras
have to be interpreted in a dierent manner. within the haag-kastler
program, the dynamics of a given quantum eld theory is usually con-
tained in the relative inclusion of local algebras, whereas a euclidean
net of c*-algebras only describes kinematical aspects. the dynamics
of euclidean eld theory model is encoded in the choice of a partic-
ular (euclidean invariant and reexion positive regular) state on the
corresponding euclidean c*-algebra:

euclidean invariance: a state  on b is called euclidean invariant
if for each h  e(d) the identity   h =  holds true.

3

reexion positivity: a state  on b is called reexion positive if
exists a euclidean direction e  sd1 such that the sesquilinear form

b(he)  b(he)  b0  b1 7 h, je(b0)b1i

is positive semi denite. here, he is the half space r+e + e with
respect to a given euclidean direction e  sd1, je is the anti-linear
involution which is given by je(b) = e(b) where e is the euclidean
reexion ex = x  2he, xie.

regularity: a state  on b is called regular if for each b0, b1, b2  b
the map

h 7 < , b0h(b1)b2 >

is continuous.

a triple (b, , ) consisting of a euclidean net of c*-algebras (b, )
and a euclidean invariant reexion positive regular state  is called a
euclidean eld.

from euclidean eld theory to quantum eld theory. we
briey describe here, as it has carried out in [28], how to construct from
a given euclidean eld a quantum eld theory.

step 1: according to the reexion positivity, for e given direction
e  sd1 there exists a hilbert space h and a linear map

 : b(he) 7 h

which is uniquely determined by

h[b0], [b1]i = < , je(b0)b1 >

and we have a distinguished vector  := [1], the vacuum vector.
following the analysis presented in [18], a unitary strongly continuous
representation of the poincare group u on h can be constructed (see
also [33, 28]). the vacuum vector  is invariant under the action of
u and, in addition to that, the spectrum of the the generator of the
translations x 7 u (x) is contained in the closed forward light cone
v+ = {x  r1,d1|x2  0; x0  0}. a more detailed description of the
construction of u is given in appendix a.

4

step 2: for a subset v of the hyperplane e, perpendicular to e, we
introduce the algebra b(v ) of time zero opeartors, localized in v , by
the intersection

b(v )

:= \sr+

b([0, s)e  v ) .

the algebar b(e) is then the c*-algebra which is generated by all
local time-zero algebras b(v ) with v  e.

there exists a *-representation  of the time-zero algebra b(e)

on h, which is uniquely determined by the relation

(b)[b1] = [bb1]

for each b1  b(he).

the algebra (b(e)) can be regarded as the cauchy data of the
quantum eld theory model by identifying the hyperplane e with the
spacelike hyperplane x0 = 0 in minkowski space r1,d1.

for a double cone o (a causally complete bounded set in minkowski
space), we dene a(o) to be the von neumann algbera on h which is
generated by all operators

[g, b]

:= u (g)(b)u (g)

(1)

with b  b(v ), such that gv  o for the poincare transformation g.
the prescription

o 7 a(o)

is an isotonous net of c*-algebras. we dene a group homomorphism
 from the poincare group to the automorphism group of a by

g := ad(u (g))

which is, by construction, covariant, i.e. g a(o) = a(go) for each
double cone o and for each poincare transformation g.

the state  on a, which is given by

< , a > = h, ai

has the following properties:

poincare invariance: for each poincare transformation g the iden-
tity   g =  holds true which is a consequence of the invariance of
 under u (g).

5

positivity of the energy: for each a1, a2  a and for each test
function f  s(r1,d1) on minkowski space whose fourier transform
f has support in the complement of the closed forward light cone v+,
the identity

z dx f (x) < , a1xa2 > = 0

is valid. this is nothing else but expressing the fact that the generators
of the translations x 7 u (x) have joint spectrum in the closed forward
light cone.

locality:
mutator [a1, a2] = 0 vanishes for a1  a(o1) and a2  a(o2).

if o1 and o2 are spacelike separated regions, then the com-

remark. whereas poincare invariance as well as the positivity of
the energy follow directly from the construction of the representation
u , the fact that locality is fullled is not directly visible. the proof,
carried out in [28], is quite lengthy. we shall see later, that the use
of tomita-takesaki theory for wedge algebras, leads to a more elegant
proof of locality.

2 modular data for wedge algebras as ge-
ometric operations in euclidean space

the present section is concerned with the discussion of the tomita-
takesaki theory of wedge algebras of the net o 7 a(o) of von neu-
mann algebras emerging from a given euclidean eld theory model. we
present here the main results of the paper, which relate the modular
operator and the modular conjugation of a particular wedge algebra
to geometric operations in euclidean space. the technical details and
the proofs are postponed to the appendix.

2.1 kms states associated with wedge algebras

for any wedge region w in minkowski space the wedge algebra with
respect to w is the von neumann algebra

a(w )

:= _ow

a(o)

generated by all local von neumann algebras a(o) with o  w .

particular wedge algebras are related to euclidean directions e0 
sd1 which are perpendicular e0  e to e. an application of the boosts

6

in (e, e0) direction to the half hyperplane p(e,e0) := he  he  he0
yields the wedge region

w(e,e0)

:= [tr

exp(tb(e,e0))p(e,e0)

.

obviously, the spacelike complement w 
(e,e0) of the wedge w(e,e0) is just
the wedge w(e,e0) with respect to the reected direction e0. writing
(e,e0) : r  aut(a) for the one-parameter automorphism group of
boosts

(e,e0,t)

:= ad(cid:20)u(e,)(exp(tb(e,e0)))(cid:21)

we obtain a w*-dynamical system (a(w(e,e0)), (e,e0)) together with a
(e,e0)-invariant state

(e,e0)

:= |a(w(e,e0 ))

,

the restriction of the vacuum state  to the corresponding wedge alge-
bra.

theorem 2.1 : for each direction e0  e, the state (e,e0) is a kms
state at inverse temperature  = 2 with respect to the w*-dynamical
system

(a(w(e,e0)), (e,e0)) .

the proof of theorem 2.1 can be obtained in complete analogy to
the analysis of [23] and we give a version of it within the appendix b.

2.2 the pct symmetry and complex lorentz boosts
as geometric operations in euclidean space

the e0-pct operator. for a euclidean direction e0  sd1
which is perpendicular to e, the euclidean reexion

e0 : x 7 x  2he0, xie

is contained in the stabilizer group of e and hence it gives rise to an
anti-unitary operator j(e,e0), called the e0-pct operator. it is dened
according to the prescription

j(e,e0)[b]

:= [je0 (b)]

and it has the geometric property (see appendix c for the proof):

proposition 2.2 : for each e0  sd1  pe the identity

j(e,e0)a(w(e,e0))j(e,e0) = a(w(e,e0))

is valid.

7

complex lorentz boosts as euclidean rotations. for a di-
rection e0  sd1, e  e0, the one-parameter group t 7 u (exp(tb(e,e0))
can be extended analytically to complex parameters on a appropriate
dense subspace of h. this is based on remarkable facts which have
been established by j. frohlich [17], on one hand, and by a. klein and
l. j. landau [24], on the other hand.

the generator l(e,e0)  so(d) of the euclidean rotations within the

e  e0 plane yields a one-parameter group of automorphisms on a

(e,e0,s)

:= exp(sl(e,e0 ))

.

for each s  (/2, /2) an operator v(e,e0)(s) is uniquely determined
by

v(e,e0)(s)[b] = [(e1,e,s)b]

for each b  b(he) with (e,e0,s)b  b(he). on an appropriate dense
subspace d  h, the operator v(e,e0)(s) is related to the one-parameter
group t 7 u (exp(tb(e,e0))) by

v(e,e0)(s) = u ( exp(isb(e,e0)) ) .

2.3 the modular operator and the modular conju-
gation for wedge algebras.

from the fact that (e,e0) is a kms state for the w*-dynamical sys-
tem (a(w(e,e0)), (e,e0)), one concludes (e.g.
[1]) that the vector  is
separating for the algebra a(w(e,e0)).

therefore there exists a modular operator (e,e0) and a modular
conjugation j(e,e0) with respect to the pair (a(w(e,e0)), ). the sub-
sequent theorem, which is proven in the appendix d, states that the
modular data can be expressed in terms of geometric actions in eu-
clidean space:

theorem 2.3 : for the modular operator (e,e0) and the modular
conjugation j(e,e0) the identities

1/2

(e,e0) = v(e,e0)()

j(e,e0) = j(e,e0)

hold true for each e0  sd1  pe.

locality and wedge duality. the statement of theorem 2.3 has
some direct implications. as already mentioned, a proof for locality of
the net o 7 a(o) has already been established in [28]. the proof of

8

theorem 2.3, which we postpone to the appendix, do not make use of
this fact and by means of theorem 2.3 we derive an independent proof
for locality which is, compared to [28], much more elegant and straight
forward.

corollary 2.4 : the net o 7 a(o) fullls wedge duality, i.e.
each wedge region w the identity

for

a(w ) = a(w )

is valid. in particular, locality holds true.

proof. as a consequence of theorem 2.3 we get

a(w(e,e0)) = a(w(e,e0))

and the poincare covariance of the net o 7 a(o) implies wedge duality
for each wedge w . therefore, the net fullls locality since for two
spacelike separated double cones o1  o 
2 there is a wedge w with
o1  w and o2  w . now wedge duality implies for operators
a1  a(o1) and a2  a(o2) that [a1, a2] = 0. (cid:3)

3 concluding remarks

we have shown, that the modular operator and the modular conju-
gation of a particular wedge algebra a(w ), associated to a given eu-
clidean eld (b, , ), do not only have the meaning as geometric action
on minkowski space in terms of lorentz boosts and reexions, they
also can be identied with geometric operations in euclidean space,
namely particular euclidean rotations and euclidean reexions. this
fact can be used to conclude wedge duality for the net o 7 a(o). as
a consequence we get, compared to the analysis carried out in [28], an
improved method in order to prove locality.

keeping in mind that the minkowskian analogue of the euclidean
d-sphere sd  rd+1 is the de sitter space, it should be possible, by
exploring the analytic structure of de sitter space, to construct from a
given euclidean eld theory (b, , ) on the sphere sd a quantum eld
theory (a, , ) in de sitter space (a forthcoming preprint is in prepa-
ration). for an example, we refer the reader to the work of r. figari,
r. hoegh-krohn, and c. r. nappi [15]. according to theorem 2.1, we
conjecture that the reconstructed state  fullls the so called geodesic
kms condition, in the sense of h. j. borchers and d. buchholz [6], i.e.
for any geodesic observer the state  looks like an equilibrium state.
in order to prove locality for the constructed quantum eld theory in
de sitter space, the method of [28], can not directly be applied since

9

here the euclidean translations are used. establishing the analogous
results of theorem 2.3 for the theory in de sitter space, locality would
also follow here.

a construction of a representation of the
poincare group

in order to keep the paper self contained, we review here the construc-
tion procedure of a representation of the poincare group from a given
eucliden eld (b, , ) in more ditail.

we rst give a list of facts which are consequences of the axioms

for a euclidean eld.

fact 1: for each e  sd there is a strongly continuous one-parameter
semi-group of contractions te with positive generator he  0 which is
given according to

te(s)[b] = [seb]

for s > 0 and for b  b(he).

fact 2: for e  sd1, w  (0, /2), the conic region (e, w) is de-
ned to be the oe(d1) invariant cone in e direction with opening angle
w. moreover, for a pair euclidean time directions e, e1  sd1, e  e1,
the generator of the rotations within the (e, e1) plane is denoted by
l(e,e1)  so(d). hence the corresponding one-parameter group yields
a one-parameter group of automorphisms on b

(e,e1,s)

:= exp(sl(e,e1 ))

and a local one-parameter group

v(e,e1) = {v(e,e1)(s)|s  (/2, /2)}

of selfadjoint operators. for each s  (/2, /2) the domain of
v(e,e1)(s) is

d(e, |s|)

:= [b((e, /2  |s|))]

for each s  (/2, /2). the operator v(e,e1)(s) is uniquely deter-
mined by

v(e,e1)(s)[b] = [(e1,e,s)b]

and there exists an anti-selfadjoint operator b(e,e1) on h such that

v(e,e1)(s) = exp(isb(e,e1)) .

for each angle w  (0, /2), the vectors in d(e, w) are analytic for
b(e1,e). this remarkable facts have been established by j. frohlich
[17], on one hand, and by a. klein and l. j. landau [24], on the other
hand.

11

fact 3: there is a unitary strongly continuous representation w on
h of the stabilizer subgroup ee(d  1) fullling

w (g)[b] = [gb]

for g  ee(d  1) and for b  b(he).

a representation of the poincare group. by making use
of the analysis of virtual representations [18] a strongly continuous
unitary representation

u  hom[p

+, u(h)]

of the poincare group can be constructed. the paper [18] exploits the
facts, listed above, and proceeds in several steps:

step 1: according to fact 3 the stabilizer subgroup ee(d1)  e(d)
is represented by w and we put

u (g)

:= w (g)

for each g  ee(d  1).

step 2: by using fact 2 for each e1  e there exists a anti-selfadjoint
operator b(e,e1) on h(,e) such that

v(e,e1)(s) = exp(isb(e,e1)) .

let b(e,e1)  o(d  1, 1) be the boost generator in e1  e direction we
dene a unitary operator by

u (exp(tb(e1,e)))

:= exp(tb(e1,e)) .

step 3: finally, the translations with respect to the time-like di-
rection which corresponds to the e-direction in euclidean space are
represented by

u (te)

:= exp(ithe)

according to fact 1.

b proof of theorem 2.1

the main steps of the proof can be performed in complete analogy to
the the analysis of [23]. we consider a family of operators b1,    , bn
which are contained in the time slice algebra, where bj  b(vj ) is lo-
calized in a convex subset vj  h(e,e0). this implies that (e,e0,s)bj 

12

b(he) for each s  (0, ) where we have chosen the condition exp(2l(e,e0)) =
1. we introduce the open subset in r2

i(vj)

:= {(, s)  r2|e2 : exp(sl(e,e0)) exp( l(e,e2))vj  he}

which contains in particular the set {0}  (0, )  i(vj). we put
v := v(e,e0) and  = [1]. by introducing the operators

bj(j)

bj(j , sj)

:=

and
:=

v(e,ej )(j )(bj)v(e,ej )(j)

(e,e0,sj )(e,ej ,j)bj

we obtain

v (sk)bk(k)    v (s1)b1(1)

= v (sk)bk(k)v (sk)v (sk + sk1)bk1(k1)v (sk  sk1)   

   v (s1)b1(1)

= v (sk)bk(k)v (sk)    v (s1 +    + sk)b1(1)

= [bk(k, sk)    b1(1, s1 +    + sk)]

.

we compute for s1,    , sn  r+, (j, sn +    + sj)  i(vj) for n 
j  k + 1 and (i, sk +    + si)  i(vi) for k  i  1:

hv (sn)bn(n)    v (sk+1)bk+1(k+1), v (sk)bk(k)   

   v (s1)b1(1)i

= < , je[bn(n, sn)    bk+1(k+1, sn +    + sk+1)]

bk(k, sk)    b1(1, sk +    + s1) >

= < , b

k+1(k+1, sn      sk+1)    b

n(n, sn)

 bk(k, sk)    b1(1, sk +    + s1) > .

13

furthermore, we nd due to our periodicity condition exp(2l) = 1:

< , b

k+1(k+1, sn      sk+1)    b

n(n, sn)

 bk(k, sk)    b1(1, sk +    + s1) >

= < , b

k+1(k+1,   sn      sk+1)    b

n(n,   sn)

 bk(k,  + sk)    b1(1,  + sk +    + s1) >

= < , bk(k,  + sk)    b1(1,  + sk +    + s1)

 b

k+1(k+1, ( + sn +    + sk+1))    b

n(n, ( + sn)) > .

in the last step we have used the locality of the euclidean net (b, ), i.e.
operators which are localized in disjoint regions commute. according
to the denition of i(vj) we have for (, s)  i(vj)

exp(sl(e,e0)) exp( l(e,ej ))vj  he

and hence

exp(( + s)l(e,e0)) exp( l(e,ej ))vj  he

and therefore (,   s))  i(vj) which implies

bk(k,  + sk)    b1(1,  + sk +    + s1)  b(he)

b
k+1(k+1,   (sn +    + sk+1))    b

n(n,   sn))  b(he) .

keeping in mind that we have

bj(j) = v(e,ej )(j)(b

j )v(e,ej )(j)

the identity

hv (sn)bn(n)    v (sk+1)bk+1(k+1), v (sk)bk(k)   

   v (s1)b1(1)i

= hv (  (s1 +    + sk))b1(1)v (s1)b2(2)    v (sk1)bk(k),

 v (  (sk+1 +    + sn))bk+1(k+1)v (sk+1)bk+2(k+2)   

   v (sn1)bn(n)i

14

follows which expresses the kms condition in the euclidean points.
finally, a straight forward application of the analysis of [23] proves the
theorem. (cid:3)

c proof of proposition 2.2

the e0-pct operator j(e,e0) commutes with the local one-parameter
group v(e,e1) for e0  e1 and it fullls the relation

j(e,e0)v(e,e0)(s)j(e,e0) = v(e,e0)(s)

as easily can be veried. for a time-zero operator b  b(e, p(e,e0)),
for a family of directions e = (e0,    , en) with ei = ej or ei  ej,
i, j = 0,    , n and for t = (t1,    , tn)  rn, we introduce an operator
(e,e)[t, b]  a(w(e,e0)), localized in the wedge w(e,e0):

(e,e)[t, b]

:= (e,e1,t1)    (e,en,tn)(b) .

the wedge algebra a(w(e,e0)) is generated by these operators and since
the operator

j(e,e0)(e,e)[t, b]j(e,e0) = (e,e)[t, je0 b]

is contained in a(w(e,e0)), the result follows, where (t)j = tj, if
ej  e0, and (t)j = tj, if ej = e0. (cid:3)

d proof of theorem 2.3

by following the analysis of [23], we choose a family of operators
b1,    , bn which are contained in the time slice algebra, where bj 
b(vj) is localized in a convex subset vj  h(e,e0). by using the
same notations as for the proof of theorem 2.1, we obtain by putting
v := v(,e,e0) and j := j(e,e0):

v (sk)bk(k)    v (s1)b1(1)

= v (sk)bk(k)v (sk)v (sk + sk1)bk1(k1)v (sk  sk1)   

   v (s1)b1(1)

= v (sk)bk(k)v (sk)    v (s1 +    + sk)b1(1)

= [bk(k, sk)    b1(1, s1 +    + sk)]

.

we compute for s1,    , sk  r+ and (i, sk +    + si)  i(vi) for
k  i  1:

j v (sk)bk(k)    v (s1)b1(1)

= [je0 (bk(k, sk)    b1(1, s1 +    + sk))]

= [b1(11,   (s1 +    + sk))    bk(kk,   sk)]

= v (  s1 +    + sk)b

1(11)v (s1)    b

k(kk)v (sk)

with j = 1 if ej  e0 and j = 1 if ej = e. performing an analytic
continuation within the parameter s1,    sk and 1,    , k and taking
boundary values at sj = j = 0 yields the relation (compare [23] as
well as [18] and [28])

j(e,e0)(cid:20) k
yj=1
= v(,e,e0)()(cid:20) k
yj=1

exp(tj b(e,ej ))bj exp(tj b(e,ej ))(cid:21)

exp(tj b(e,ej ))bj exp(tj b(e,ej ))(cid:21)



which implies that the tomita operator is

j(e,e0)1/2

(e,e0) = j(e,e0)v(e,e0)() .

moreover, according to theorem 2.1, the automorphism group

(e,e0) : t 7 ad[u (exp(tb(e,e0))]

maps a(w(e,e0)) into itself and the state

(e,e0) = |a(w(e,e0 ))

is a kms state at inverse temperature  = 2 and the theorem follows.
