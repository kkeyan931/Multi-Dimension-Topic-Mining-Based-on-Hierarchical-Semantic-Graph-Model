abstract

the boundary charge which constitute the virasoro algebra in 2+1 dimen-

sional anti-de sitter gravity is derived by way noether theorem and dieo-

morphic invariance.

it shows that the boundary charge under discussion

recently exhausts all the independent nontrivial charges available. there-

fore, the state counting via the virasoro algebra is complete.

1 introduction

general relativity is a highly non-linear eld theory which is very complicated at both clas-

sical and quantum level. in fact, the concept of quantum gravity has not been established in

3+1 dimensions, let alone the whole theory of it. this renders the gravitational interaction

be the only one in nature still to quantized. while paying eorts to the quantization of

gravitation in 3+1 dimensions, physicists have also been working with the problem in lower

dimensions in the past decades in order to get some hints. a remarkable observation was

made by brown and henneaux [1] that the asymptotic symmetry group of ads2+1 is gen-

erated by (two copies of) the virasoro algebra, and that therefore any consistent quantum

the central charge as c = 3

theory of gravity on ads2+1 is a conformal eld theory. they further computed the value of
2g, where g is the newtons gravitational constant and  is the
cosmological constant. witten rst showed that 2+1 dimensions einstein gravity (with or

without cosmological term) can be formulated as a chern-simons thoery[2] and this renders

the theory exactly soluable at the classical and quantum levels. as in 3+1 dimensions, black

hole aspects in lower dimensions have also been of great interests, and the discovery of btz

black hole [3][4]has proven to be a milestone. based on the discovery in [1] and cardys

formula for state counting in conformal eld theories[5], , strominger was able to compute

microscopically the black hole entropy from the asymptotic growth of states[6] , and this

helped a lot about the understanding of the origin of bekenstein-hawking entropy. now it is

understood that boundary behavior of the spacetime is very important to the understanding

of both the classical dynamics and the quantum aspects[8] [9]. the highlights is like this.

firstly, one is to nd hilbert space consisting of all the solutions. secondly, one is to nd

as many as possible charges qin order to classify the solutions accoding to whether one can

be generated by the charges from another. it is obvious that once we can nd a complete

set of charges (like the complete set of operators in quantum mechnics)q, i.e. no more,

the structure of the hilbert space can be completely determined. then two problems arises

immediately. one is whether the charges are physical observables, the other is how we could

nd as many as possible the charges. to the rst one, we take the point of view that the

charges in [8][9] are observables because even if they do not commute with the constraints,

they could still be according to the argument in[10]. the second question is to be answered

here.

in this paper, we make use of the dieomorphism invariance and the noether theorem

to obtain the conservative charges corresponding to each arbitrary dieormorphism trans-

formation.

it is found that the charges take exactly the same form as those in [9] that

3

transform one solution to another dierent one. so the collection of charges there exhausts

all the conservative charges corresponding to dieomorphisms. the layout of this paper is

like this. section 2 is a presentation of the general approach to conservation laws in general

relativity. section 3 applies this approach to 2+1 dimensional gravity. section 4 is devoted

to nal discussions.

2 general scheme for conservation laws in general

relativity

as in 1+3 einstein gravity, conservation laws are also the consequence of the invariance

of the action corresponding to some transforms.

in order to study the covariant energy-

momentum of more complicated systems, it is benifecial to discuss conservation laws by

noether theorem in general[11][12] . suppose that the spacetime is of dimension d = 1 + d

and the lagrangian is in the rst order formalism, i.e.

i = zg

l(a, a)ddx

(1)

where a denotes the generic elds. if the action is invariant under the innitesimal trans-

forms

x = x + x

a(x) = a(x) + a(x)

(2)

(it is not required that a

|g = 0), then the following relation holds[8]-[10](see the proof in

the appendix) .

where

(lx +

l

a

0a) + [l]a0a = 0

[l]a =

l
a  

l

a

and 0a is the lie variation of a

0a = a(x)  a(x) = a(x)  ax

(3)

(4)

(5)

if l is the total lagrangian of the system, the eld equations of a is just [l]a = 0.

hence from eq.(3), we can obtain the conservation equation corresponding to transform

eq.(2)

(lx +

l

a

0a) = 0

(6)

4

it is important to recognize that if l is not the total lagrangian , e.g. the gravitational part

lg, then so long as the action of lg remains invariant under transform eq.(2), eq.(3) is still

valid yet eq.(6) is no longer admissible because of [lg]a 6= 0.

suppose that a denotes the riemann tensors a

 and riemann scalars a ( for the model

considered in this paper, they are a()a



and there are no riemann scalar elds).eq.(3) reads

(lgx +

lg
a


0a

 ) + [lg]a



0a

 = 0

under transforms eq.(2), the lie variations are

0a

 = x

, a

  a

,x

where the dot , denotes partial derivative. so eq.(7) reads

[lgx 

lg
a


(x

,a

 + a

,x)]  [lg]a



(x

,a

 + a

,x) = 0

comparing the coecients of x , x

, and x

,, we may obtain an identity

([lg]a



a

 ) = [lg]a



a
,

then eq.(9) can be written as

[lgx 

lg
a


(x

,a

 + a

,x)  [lg]a



a
 x] = 0

or

[(lg

 

lg
a


by denition, we introduce

a

,  [lg]a



a
 )x 

lg
a
,

a
 x

,] = 0

i 
 = (lg

 

lg
a


a

,  [lg]a



a
 )

then eq.(12) gives

z 

 =

lg
a
,

a


( i 

 x + z 

 x

,) = 0

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

so by comparing the coecients of x , x

, and x

,, we have the following from eq.(15)

 i 

 = 0

(16)

 =  z 
i 



 =  z 
z 



5

(17)

eq.(16)-(17) are fundamental to the establishing of conservation law of energy-momentum

in [11] and [12].

now suppose that x = (x), with  is an innitesiaml constant parameter and (x)

is an arbitrary vector. then it follows that from eq.(15) -eq.(17)

where

and

j() = 0

j() =  z 

z  = z 

 

accordingly, we have the conserved charge associated with xi

q[] = z
it is obvious that if we choose  = e

j0d2x = z

z i0ijdxj

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

aa, a = const., we can obtain the energy-moemntum

immediately.

3 dieomorphic charges in ads2+1 gravity

einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant can be re-formulated as a chern-

simons theory for the group sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) [2], with connection one-forms

a()a = a

l

ea

(22)

where ea = ea

dx is the triad and the a = 1

2 abcbcdx is the spin connection. the

einstein-hilbert action becomes

i = ics[a()]  ics[a(+)]

where

ics[a] =

action is explicitly expressed as

2 1, where 1,2,3 are the ordinary pauli matrices, k should take the
4 abc, 012 = 1, ab = diag(1, 1, 1). so the

it should be mentined that it is quite novel that the chern-simons formulation not

only reproduce the enstein-hilbert part of the lagrangian, but also can reproduce the

chern-simons of the spin connection, this is can accomplished by modifying the quardratic

forms[12][13]

.

now from eq.(14), (19) and eq.(25), we have

z () =

or, if we dene a = aa

 as in [8],we have up to a constant factor

q() =

4 z abaab

kdxk

(27)

(28)

treating the parameter a as eld independent, this is just the charge generating gauge

transformations. how to obtain the charge generating dieomorphism transformations?

note that to an arbitrary vector whose zero component is zero = (0, , ), there exists

a charge corresponging to it, now consider another vactor 

 = (0, , 0). the sum of q()

and q(

) then realizes the charge required which is re-termed as q() (in the special gauge

aa

 = a, it is just the eq.(2.18) in [8])

q() =

k

4 z

ab(aa

ab

 + iaa

i ab

)d

(29)

note that in both cases, the charges is dierentiable with respect to the connction a. one

can naturally go even further: what it will generate if the  is made more eld-dependent?

7

suppose that a is a functional of aa

i and the functional derivative is well-dened everywhere.

then consider the functional

g() =

k

(30)

under any variation aa

q =

[z

so if we impose the condition that a

| = 0, then functional derivative of q with respect

to a is well-dened.

using the canonical poisson brackets {aa

(33)

where the  means modulo the constraints. that is, g((a)) generates still a gauge trans-

form.

since there are two copies of vector elds,i.e. a(), for each copy, there exists a con-

servative charge associated to every dieomorphism. for any specic spacetime, the set of

charges is unique as far as the numerical quantity of the charges are concerned. especially,

the energy-momentum and angular-momentum are also among them [14][15] (it should not

be strange that the angular-momentum can be also obtain since gauge transformation of ea


and a

 can be reproduced by dieomorphism transformations in chern-simons formulation
of gravity in 2+1 dimensions) since they can be aquired by linear combinations from q()

associated to constant .

4 discussions

in this paper, we have obtained the conservative charges associated with dieomorphisms in

chern-simons formulation of 2+1 gravity and shown that the boundary charges generating

virasoro algebra exhaust all the independent charges. therefore the state counting based

on the representation of virasoro algebra is complete.

8

it seems non-trivial to ask the question that why the boundary dynamics is so important

to the understanding of the quantum feature of gravity in 2+1 dimensions. to our under-

standing, observables are at the kernel in any physical theory. in other non-gravitational

physical theories, the observables such as energy-momentum and angular-momentum are

localized while for gravitation, they are both determined by the dynamics of the eld at

spatial innity [11][14][16]. therefore, the boundary behaviour should play an important

role in both classical and quantum aspects.

if the quantum theory of 2+1 dimensional gravity can be extended to the more realistic

3+1 einstein gravity,it soon becomes clear that the quantum feature of gravity will be deter-

mined to a great extent by the boundary behavior while that of other interactions (such as

qed and qcd) is determined mainly by local behaviour (of course some global properties

are also important). does it mean that the future unication of quantum gravity and other

quantum eld theories is an unication of local quantum theory with global quantum thoery?

this is any way the gravity an important conceptual problem.

appendix: proof of equation (3)

the action is supposed to be of the rst order form eq.(1). the transformation of a in

eq.(2) contains two parts: the induced variation due to the coordinate transformation and

the variation by its own. under the coordinate transform, the integration domain g is

transformed to g

 , so the variation of the action is

in general relativity, the action i is invariant under the transformation eq.(2) due to the
