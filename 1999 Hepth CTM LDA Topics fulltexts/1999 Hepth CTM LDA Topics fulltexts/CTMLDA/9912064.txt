(15) (16) first all, needed nd solutions (16) eld uctuations would damping innities (then integral non-minimal term nite). words, suppose boundary conditions evidently correspond singular stourm-liouville problem describing bound states quantum system. further, varying orbit equation (7) obtain expression fa(+) = fa() = o(1), (17) f2 f1 = 2 (s) 1 (s) 2 = 2 (s) (s) 1 , one separate fa (16) virtue of. thus, two independent stourm-liouville problems resolved exactly completely. following theorem useful connection. theorem. let us dierential equation f (u) + 2 3x 2 0 c arbitrary constant, 2 = 1, + 3 4 ! f (u) cf (u) + x 0 = 0, (18) x0 =s 1 + 2 sch2u. 4 corresponding stourm-liouville problem, f (+) = f () = o(1), (19) solution : f (=+1) = k sinhu + 1 3cosh2u , f (=1) = sinhu + b 3cosh2u , thereby corresponding eigenvalues c = 3, b k arbitrary integration constants.1 use theorem obtain solutions system (16) provided (17) two sets eigenfunctions eigenvalues distinguished virtue hat index f1n = sch2 (m) , cn f2n = cn = 3(1)nm2, n = 0, 1. tanh cosh cn , (20) substituting found functions back action (13), rewrite explicit p-brane form se = (class) e + (uct) e = z ds x2(cid:16) + k2(cid:17) , (21) (22) see eq.
