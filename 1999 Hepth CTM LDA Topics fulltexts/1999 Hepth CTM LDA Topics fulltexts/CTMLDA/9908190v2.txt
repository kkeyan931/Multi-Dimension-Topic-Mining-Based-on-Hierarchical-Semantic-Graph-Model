abstract

a systematic algorithm to derive superpropagators in the case of either explicitly or spontaneously
broken supersymmetric three-dimensional theories is presented. we discuss how the explicit breaking
terms that are introduced at tree-level induce 1-loop radiative corrections to the eective action.
we also point out that the renormalisation eects and the breaking-inducing-breaking mechanism
become more immediate whenever we adopt the shifted superpropagators discussed in this letter.

supergraph techniques have shown their ecacy since the early works on supereld perturbation
theory introduced by salam and strathdee [1]. they also appeared to be an essential tool for the proof of
the niteness of the n =2 and n =4 super-yang-mills theories to all orders in perturbation theory [2, 3].
power-counting, the analysis of the ultraviolet behaviour of globally supersymmetric and supergravity
theories, and loop computations by means of super-feynman rules, are much more compact and have
been employed in a number of works to detect at which order in the perturbative series the s-matrix may
indicate the appearance of divergences [4].

supersymmetry however is not an exact symmetry of the low-energy world. the breaking, either
spontaneous or explicit, must be thoroughly studied not only for phenomenological purposes, but also to
check till which extent deviations from exact supersymmetry may still be compatible with the taming of
the divergences imposed by such a symmetry. along this line of thought, girardello and grisaru [5] have
sorted out a detailed classication of all soft and hard breakings of supersymmetry in four dimensions;
their work triggered a whole line of investigation on the issue of explicit breaking of global supersymmetry
[6]. explicitly broken two-dimensional supersymmetric gauge models have been widely studied in [7]. in
three dimensions, by following similar strategy of [5], gates and nishino have been classied the soft
breakings terms of n =2 supersymmetry [8]. the issue of partial spontaneous supersymmetry breaking
n =2n =1 in d=3 has been studied in [9].

recently, supersymmetry in three dimensions has been reconsidered in connection with yang-mills-
chern-simons gauge theories, which display remarkable features as long as their ultraviolet properties
are concerned, namely their niteness at all orders in perturbation theory [10]. also, with the raising

of interest on supermembranes, three-dimensional supersymmetry becomes a major eld of investigation
[11].

our letter sets out to reassess supereld feynman rules whenever supersymmetry is broken (sponta-
neously or explicitly) in three dimensions. indeed, spontaneous breakdown may always be rephrased as
explicit breakings, with explicit -dependence, after superelds are shifted by their vacuum expectation
values.

so, for the sake of setting a systematic procedure to derive superpropagators in the case of broken
supersymmetry, we concentrate on the explicit breakings since they naturally account for the case of
spontaneous breaking. with the results we shall present in the sequel, the reassessment of supergraph
calculations for 3d broken supersymmetric models becomes more systematic and approximations intro-
duced by simply treating the breakings as insertions are by-passed, since we are able to sum up the latter
to all orders and so modify the superpropagators with all powers in the breaking parameters, rather than
viewing the breakings as new vertices that correct the exact superpropagators.

we consider an explicitly broken supersymmetric theory of a complex scalar supereld, , minimally

coupled to a real spinor gauge supereld, .

in three dimensions, the most general complex scalar supereld may be -expanded in component

elds as follows 4:

(x, ) = a(x) + (x)  2f (x) ,

(1)

with a and  being respectively complex scalar and two-component spinor elds, while f is a complex
auxiliary scalar eld. on the other hand, a three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge eld theory may be
described by a real spinor supermultiplet,

(x, ) = (x)  [cb(x)  iv(x)]  2[2(x)  i

(x)]

,

(2)

where  and  are (real) majorana spinors, b is a real scalar, whereas v 
potential and va being the gauge eld. also, we dene the gauge-invariant eld-strength supereld:

 = (a) 

 va is the gauge

w =

1
2

dd ,

(3)

constrained by dw = 0.

the minimal coupling between matter and gauge superelds is accomplished by means of the covariant

supersymmetric gauge derivative:

 = d  ig and  = d + ig ,

(4)

where g is the coupling constant.

then, we start from an action describing the broken theory of a complex matter supereld minimally

coupled to the gauge supereld in three dimensions:

s = sm + sg ,

sm = z dv(cid:26)

with

and

(5)

(6)

(7)

sg =

2 z dv(cid:8)(1  22m)w w + w(cid:9) ,

where m and  are the mass parameters, whereas m, m2
a and m are the coecients for the broken
terms in the matter and gauge sectors (an explicit breaking associated to the chern-simons term, namely
2w, has not been considered for such a term also explicitly breaks gauge invariance). besides the
matter broken terms, sm contains kinetic and massive terms for the matter supereld along with the
minimal coupling to the gauge supereld, while sg contains kinetic and the topological gauge-invariant
mass terms for the gauge supereld.

furthermore, the action (5) is invariant under the following gauge transformations:

 = ik and  =

1
g

dk ,

(8)

4the notations and conventions adopted throughout this work are those of ref.[4], and the superspace measure adopted is
 and {a, b} = 2ab,

dv = d3xd2. the representation for the -matrices is taken as a = (y , iz , ix), where a  (a) 
with the metric being given by ab = diag( + +).

where k = k(x, ) is a real scalar supereld. in order to obtain the superpropagators, one has to x
this gauge invariance; we add the following gauge-xing term to the action of eq.(5):

sgf =

4 z dv (d)d2(d) .

(9)

now we turn to the attainment of the superpropagators for the matter and gauge sectors by taking

the inverse of the wave operators 5.

the bilinear piece that stems from the action for the matter superelds is the following:

(d)(d) + m  2m(d)(d) + 2ma(cid:27)

m = z dv (cid:26)
= z dv k ,

where the operator k reads as below:

k = d2 + m + m(22d2 + d) + m2

a2 .

(10)

(11)

in order to invert the above wave operator and consequently obtain the superpropagator, we shall
use the projection operator formalism. the operators associated to the scalar supereld are classied as
follows:

p1 = d2 , p2 = 2 , p3 = d , p4 = 2d2 and p5 = id ,

(12)

and their operator algebra is displayed in table 1. moreover, we present some useful relations:

{d, } = c ,
[d2, ] = d ,

(cid:8)d, (cid:9) =  



[d, 2] =  and [d2, 2] = 1 + d .

,

{d, } =  


,

(cid:8)d, (cid:9) = c  ,

thus, rewriting k in terms of the operators p ( = 0, 1, ..., 5), we have

k = mp0 + p1 + m2

ap2 + mp3 + 2mp4 ,

where p0  1.

using the algebra of table 1, we readily obtain the superpropagator:

h0| t [(x1, 1)(x2, 2)] |0i = ik1

from the poles in k2, it becomes clear that the physical scalar and the fermion eld have their masses
shifted with respect to the degenerated value corresponding to exact supersymmetry.

the propagators for the component elds can be read o by making use of the following relations:

which agree with the propagators calculated from the component-eld action stemming from eq.(6).

as for the gauge sector, similarly to the matter sector, we may nd the superpropagator for the gauge

supereld. the bilinear piece of (5) for the gauge supereld plus the gauge-xing term, (9), reads

here, we must introduce other twelve superspace operators coming from the gauge sector, which can

be expressed in terms of the ps as follows:

(22)

where  = 0, 1, ..., 5. their algebra is presented in table 2.

by using the property pipj = p akpk (see table 1) and (22), where i, j, k = 1, 2, ..., 5, we may check

that the algebra presented in table 2 is in fact closed. thus, the wave operator k can be rewritten as

once we worked out the matter and gauge superpropagators with the breaking parameters summed up
to all orders, we have at our disposal enough data to discuss how the explicit breakings that are introduced
at tree-level induce 1-loop radiative corrections to the eective action. we adopt the supereld feynman
rules as presented and discussed in ref.[4] and make use of the superpropagators derived in our paper.

if there are matter superelds in sucient number such that 3-interaction vertices do not break gauge
invariance, tadpole supergraphs with a -supereld on the external leg may induce a loop correction to
the f -term, as a result of the term with the operator p4 present in the -propagator. f -terms are
not radiatively induced as a result of the gauge interaction, since the gauge couplings do not allow a
-tadpole with a loop where the gauge supereld ow inside alone. it is the matter self-interaction and
the explicit breakings governed by m and ma the responsible for the 1-loop generation of an f -term.

also, it is interesting to notice that, if we consider the 2-point function with  and  on the external
legs and the matter superpropagators running inside the loop, the matter breaking terms induce a 1-loop
correction to the supersymmetric chern-simons mass term; as for the gauge supereld kinetic term, no
correction arises that comes from the breakings. the technical reason to understand these results is a
simple counting of covariant derivatives inside the loop (some are brought by the propagators, others
appear as vertex factors).

the gauge-invariant term that splits the scalar mass inside the matter supermultiplet (2) in-
duces a 1-loop correction to the breaking term that splits the gaugino mass in the gauge supermultiplet
(2w w): such a term appears as the result of the interference between breaking terms present in
the matter superpropagators. conversely, it is noteworthy to remark that the gaugino mass breaking
term yields a 1-loop correction that explicitly breaks supersymmetry and splits the scalar mass inside
the matter multiplet. the latter result can be readily attained if we compute a 1-loop diagram with

5

matter superelds on the external legs and a gauge superpropagator appearing as an internal line of the
corresponding 1-loop graph.

concluding these comments, one of the advantages of working with this somewhat complicated su-
perpropagators is that, once the breaking parameters are taken into account to all orders, we get a safe
and systematic algorithm for deriving radiative corrections to the breakings as induced from one an-
other. the investigation of the eective action, renormalisation eects and breaking-inducing-breaking
mechanism become more automatic if we adopt to work with these full superpropagators. in situations
where a spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry takes place, and shifts have to be performed around the
true ground state, explicit breakings as the ones collected above show up (spontaneous supersymmetry
breaking appears in superspace as -terms) and our computations may become useful to compute ra-
diative corrections to the eective action and to physical quantities derived from the eective potential.
in the case supersymmetry is broken for a gauge model, we have to generalize the r-gauge with now
-dependent present, since the superelds  and  mix up with a 2-factor. this problem is now under
investigation, and we shall soon report our results elsewhere.
