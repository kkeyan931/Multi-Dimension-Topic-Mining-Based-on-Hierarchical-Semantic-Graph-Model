(11) coincides previous result chung oh {$9812132$} well jackiw kostelecky , b-linear contribution induced chern-simons term calculated. understand identity lowest-order calculation all-order calculation following argument coleman glashow , (communicated us s. coleman via r. jackiw). consider expanding b-dependent vacuum polarization amplitude powers b (b-perturbation theory). nth order two-index, i.e. two-photon, amplitude, n chiral insertions (of b/5). except rst order free linear divergences. (abelian axial anomalies come triangle graph! ) hence ambiguity evaluating higher order graphs, coleman-glashow trick may used: momentarily let two photons carry dierent momenta, say p1 p2 (this means chiral insertions carry non-zero momentum); gauge invariance (transversality) photons, learn amplitude o(p1) o(p2); i.e. o(p1p2); go equal momenta, p1 = p2 = p, observe amplitude must o(p2). chern-simons term one seeking o(p); hence higher-order graphs contribute. contribution comes lowest order, regularization dependent (or unique method evaluation jackiw kostelecky  adopted). acknowledgments thank professor r. jackiw enlightening discussions acknowledge center theoretical physics, mit, warm hospitality. work supported part korea science engineering foundation, part united states department energy grant number df-fc02-94er40818. 4
