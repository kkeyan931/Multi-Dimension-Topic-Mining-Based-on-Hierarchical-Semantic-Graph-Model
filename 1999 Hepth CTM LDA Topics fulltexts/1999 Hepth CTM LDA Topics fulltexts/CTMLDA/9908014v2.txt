abstract

i identify the class of even-dimensional conformal eld theories that is most similar to
two-dimensional conformal eld theory. in this class the formula, elaborated recently, for the
irreversibility of the renormalization-group ow applies also to massive ows. this implies a
prediction for the ratio between the coecient of the euler density in the trace anomaly (charge
a) and the stress-tensor two-point function (charge c). more precisely, the trace anomaly in
external gravity is quadratic in the ricci tensor and the ricci scalar and contains a unique
central charge. i check the prediction in detail in four, six and eight dimensions, and then in
arbitrary even dimension.

four-dimensional conformal eld theories have two central charges, c and a, dened by the
trace anomaly in a gravitational background. the charge c multiplies the conformal invariant
w 2
 (square of the weyl tensor) and is the coecient of the two-point function of the stress
tensor. the quantity a multiplies the euler density g4 = r
 . a third term,
2r, is multiplied by a coecient a:

in higher, even dimension n the trace anomaly contains more terms, which can however be
grouped into the same three classes as in four dimensions. several terms are exactly invariant
under conformal transformations and are not total derivatives. they generalize w 2. the
constants in front of these terms will be denoted collectively by c. one of such central charges,
in particular, is related to the stress-tensor two-point function. it multiplies an invariant of the
form w 2n/22w  + o(w 3). the central charge a is always unique and multiplies the
euler density gn, which is not conformally invariant, but a non-trivial total derivative. finally,
the constants in front of the trivial total derivatives, which generalize 2r, will be collectively
denoted by a.

only in two dimensions [1] has the trace anomaly a unique term, the ricci scalar r. in some
sense, we can say that c = a = a there. it is natural to expect that there exists a special class
of higher-dimensional conformal eld theories that is most similar to two-dimensional conformal
eld theory. this class will have to be identied by a universal relationship between the central
charges c, a and a.

the main purpose of this paper is to identify this class of conformal theories, collecting

present knowledge and oering further evidence in favour of the statement.
sum rule of refs.
[2, 3] for the irreversibility of the renormalization-group ow to derive a
quantitative prediction from this idea, namely the ratio between the coecient an of the euler
density gn and the coecient cn of the invariant w2n/22w  + o(w 3) (or, which is
the same, the constant in front of the stress-tensor two-point function). secondly, i argue that
the conformal eld theories of our special class are also those whose trace anomaly in external
gravity is quadratic in the ricci tensor and ricci scalar. this property relates unambigously
the central charges c to the unique central charge a and, in particular, should agree with the
ratio cn/an found using the irreversibility of the rg ow.

i then proceed to check the prediction. this is rst done in detail in four, six and eight
dimensions and then extended to the general case. the results are also a very non-trivial test
of the ideas of refs. [2, 3] about the irreversibility of the rg ow.

i recall that in [4, 5] it was shown that in four dimensions there is a closed limit, in which
the stress-tensor operator product expansion (ope) closes with a nite number of operators
up to the regular terms. the idea of this limit was suggested by a powerful theorem, due to
ferrara, gatto and grillo [6] and to nachtmann [7], on the spectrum of anomalous dimensions

2

of the higher-spin currents generated by the ope, which follows from very general principles
(unitarity) and is therefore expected to hold in arbitrary dimension.

when c = a [4], ope closure is achieved in a way that is reminiscent of two-dimensional
conformal eld theory, with the stress tensor and the central extension. instead, when c 6= a the
algebraic structure is enlarged and contains spin-1 and spin-0 operators, yet in nite number.
therefore, the subclass of theories we are interested in is identied, in four dimensions, by the
equality of c and a and the closed limit. secondly, it is well known that  vanishes on ricci-at
metrics when c = a in four dimensions. a closer inspection of (1) shows that actually  is
quadratic in the ricci tensor and the ricci scalar. we are led to conjecture that the subclass
of c = a-theories in arbitrary even dimension are those that have a trace anomaly quadratic
in the ricci tensor and the ricci scalar.

summarizing, in arbitrary even dimension greater than 2 we can distinguish the following

important subclasses of conformal eld theories:

i) the closed theories, when the quantum conformal algebra, i.e. the algebra generated
by the singular terms of the stress-tensor ope, closes with a nite number of operators. they
can have c = a [4], but also c 6= a [5].

ii) the c = a-theories, whose trace anomaly is quadratic in the ricci tensor and the ricci

scalar. they can be either closed or open.

iii) the closed c = a-theories, which exhibit the highest degree of similarity with two-

dimensional conformal eld theory.

while the equality c = a is a restriction on the set of conformal eld theories, the equality
of a and a is not. in refs. [2, 3] the equality a = a was studied in arbitrary even dimension n,
leading to the sum rule

expressing the total renormalization-group (rg) ow of the central charge an, induced by the
running of dimensionless couplings. this formula was checked to the fourth-loop order included
in the most general renormalizable theory in four [2] and six [3] dimensions. no restriction on
the central charges c and a is required here. the charge an is normalized so that the trace

as it was explained in the introduction of [2], the arguments of [2, 3] do not necessarily
apply to ows generated by super-rinormalizable couplings and mass terms. (in general, the
eect of masses can be included straightforwardly [8].) the sum rule (2) measures the eect of
the dynamical rg scale  in lowering the amount of massless degrees of freedom of the theory
along the rg ow.

the basic reason why massive ows behave dierently is that in a nite theory dus
identication [9] a = c is consistent (but not unique), while along a rg ow the only consistent

3

identication is a = a, as shown in [2]. divergences are crucial in discriminating between the
two cases. a ow induced by divergences cannot, in general, be assimilated to a ow induced
by explicit (classical) scales.

repeating the arguments of [2, 3] in two dimensions, we would come to the same conclusion
as in higher dimensions: that the sum rule (2) works for rg ows and not necessarily for
massive ones. the point is, nevertheless, that the two-dimensional version of (2), due to cardy
[10], is universal; in particular, it does work for massive ows. it is therefore compulsory to
understand in what cases the domain of validity of our sum rule (2) is similarly enhanced in
higher dimensions. this property identies the special class of theories we are looking for.

the arguments and explicit checks that we now present show that this enhancement takes
place in the subclass of theories with c = a (classes ii and iii above), because of the higher
similarity with the two-dimensional theories.

massive ows have been considered, among other things, by cappelli et al.

in [12]. an

explicit computation for free massive scalar elds and fermions gives [12]

(3)

repeating the computation for massive vectors, or (n/2  1) -forms, is problematic in the uv.
however, the relative coecient between the scalar and fermion contributions is sucient to
show that the result is proportional to cn and not an.

our prediction is that in the special c = a-theories the sum rule (2) should reproduce (3)

for massive ows, which means

the trace anomaly therefore has the form

formula (4) is the generalized version of the relation c = a. it is uniquely implied by the
requirement that  be quadratic in the ricci tensor and ricci curvature. this condition xes all

4

the central charges of type c in terms of an, not only the constant cn in front of the stress-tensor
two-point function. these further relationships are not important for our purposes.

in four dimensions the combination between the parenthesis in (5) is indeed quadratic in

the ricci tensor:

i stress that this is a non-trivial check of the prediction that formula (2) correctly describes
massive ows when c = a.

in higher dimensions the check is less straightforward, owing to the high number of invari-
ants. using the results of bonora et al. from [13] (see also [14]), where the terms occurring in
the trace anomaly were classied in six dimensions, we can perform a second non-trivial check
of our prediction. the conformal invariants are three:


 ,

i1 = ww w 
i3 = w(cid:18)2 

 + 4r

 

i2 = ww w

(cid:19) w ,

and the general form of the trace anomaly is

 = a6g6 +

c(i)ii + t.t.d.,

3

xi=1

where t.t.d. means trivial total derivatives (as opposed to g6, which is a non-trivial
total derivative). our notation diers from the one of [13] in the signs of r and r. more
importantly, the invariant i3 diers from the invariant m3 of [13] and other references [15], the
latter containing a spurious contribution proportional to g6 (see also [3], section 3), as well as
a linear combination of i1 and i2. precisely, we nd

m3 =

g6 +

80

i1 +

40
3

i2  5i3.

finally, our i3 diers from the expression of ref. [16], formula (19), by the addition of t.t.d.s,
which, however, can be consistently omitted for our purposes.

in [13] it is pointed out that there exists a simple combination of the four invariants g6 and

i1,2,3, which reads

j6 = r 2r

(6)

the bpb (bonorapastibregola) term j6 is precisely the combination we are looking for. a
closer inspection of this expression shows that it is uniquely xed by the requirement that it be
quadratic in the ricci tensor and ricci curvature. on the other hand, the requirement that j6

5

just vanishes on ricci-at metrics is not sucient to x it uniquely, in particular it does not
imply the relation c = a that we need.

in conclusion, the c = a-theories have a unique central charge, multiplying the bpb invariant

j6,

 = 24 a6 j6,

c(1) = 96a6, c(2) = 24a6, c(3) = 8a6,

so that  is of the predicted form (5):

 = a6(g6  8w 2w ) +  .

(7)

our prediction is meaningful in arbitrary even dimension and can be checked using the
recent work of henningson and skenderis [17], which contains, as i now discuss, an algorithm
to generate precisely the invariants jns that we need.
it is easy to verify this in four and
six dimensions.
in six dimensions the result can be read from formula (30) of [17], taking
into account that in [17] the bpb invariant m3 is used. a more convenient decomposition
of the anomaly into euler density and conformal invariants is the last equality of (6), leading
directly to (7). it is therefore natural to expect that the algorithm of [17] answers our question
and constructs the invariants jns. i now check agreement with formula (5) in arbitrary even
dimension.

i begin with n = 8. the relevant terms of j8 are

j8 = r 22r 

2
7

r22r + o(r3) = 8 g8 + c.i. + t.t.d.,

8 being the unknown coecient and c.i. denoting conformal invariants. on a sphere, in
particular, all terms but 8g8 vanish, so that 8 can be found by evaluating the integral of j8:

gj8 d8x = 768 8 (4)4.

using

w 22w =

7

r22r(cid:19) + o(r3) + t.t.d.,

our prediction (5) is 8 = 1/64. indeed, applying the method of [17] on a conformally-at
metric with r = g , we get, after a non-trivial amount of work,

j8 = 8 g8 =

calculator, we have checked agreement between (9) and (10) up to dimension 1000.

our picture and the quantitative agreement with prediction (5 ) explain, among other things,
the physical meaning of the construction of ref. [17]. furthermore, the mathematical properties
of the invariant jn, and therefore the identication of c and a (in the subclasses of theories
ii and iii where it applies), are a nice counterpart of the notion of extended (pondered) euler
density introduced in [3], which explained the identication a = a. the results presented in
this paper are a further check of the ideas of [2, 3] and of the picture oered there. these are,
we believe, the rst steps towards the classication of all conformal eld theories.

the set of higher-dimensional quantum eld theories, conformal or not, is not rich of phys-
ical models. yet, one can consider higher-derivative theories, which, despite the issues about
unitarity (see for example [18]), are useful toy-models for our purposes. here higher-dimensional
higher-derivative theories are meant as a convenient laboratory where the results of the present
paper might be applied.
