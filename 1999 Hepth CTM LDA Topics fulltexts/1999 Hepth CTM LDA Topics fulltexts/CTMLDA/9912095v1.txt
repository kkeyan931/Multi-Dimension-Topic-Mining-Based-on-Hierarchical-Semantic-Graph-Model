abstract

i consider theories of dirac fermions with dierent regularizations, leading to dierent
chiral anomalies. i have investigated the poincare invariance properties of these theories.
i nd that both lorentz and translational invariance are anomalously violated in general,
but that they are respected in a theory that is regularized to give a wess-zumino consistent
anomaly (the bardeen anomaly). in a theory that is regularized to give a covariant anomaly,
poincare invariance is not respected, and in this case i calculate the divergence of the angular
momentum current and energy-momentum tensor in a nonabelian theory with external vector
and axial vector sources.

introduction

chiral anomalies have many important applications in particle physics [1]. for example, they are
relevant for the decay 0  , for the solution to the u (1) puzzle, and for nding constraints
on the fermion content in gauge theories. anomalies appear due to the regularization of the
fermionic part of the theory, and represents a quantum mechanical breakdown of the classical
symmetries of the fermion. when such breakdown occurs, the currents associated with these
symmetries are not conserved, but have the anomalies as their divergence.

there are certain ambiguities connected with the anomalies. if we consider for example the
theory of a nonabelian fermion coupled to external vector (v ) and axial vector (a) sources, it
is known that it is possible to regularize the theory so that the divergence of the vector current
vanishes and the divergence of the axial vector current is equal to the wess-zumino consistent
chiral anomaly [2]. another possibility is to have covariant anomalies [3], in which case both
the divergence of the current and of the axial current are dierent from zero.

in this paper i consider the problem of the poincare invariance properties of these dierently
regularized theories. to my knowledge this has not been investigated before. i have found that
poincare invariance is not respected for many regularizations  rather, it is broken by anomalies.
for example, the theory with covariant regularization is not poincare invariant. i calculate the

anomalous divergence of the angular momentum current and energy-momentum tensor in this
case. on the other hand, if the theory is regularized to give the bardeen anomaly, which is
consistent, then the angular momentum current and energy-momentum tensor have vanishing
divergences, and poincare invariance is intact.

it may be worth pointing out that the poincare anomalies in this paper are not directly
related to the well known gravitational anomalies [4]. in the gravitational case, the anomalies
appear from feynman diagrams with a number of energy-momentum tensors at the vertices. in
the poincare case on the other hand, they appear from diagrams with one energy-momentum
tensor and a number of vectors and axial vectors (for the translational anomalies), or one angular
momentum current and a number of vectors and axial vectors (for the lorentz anomalies).

the organization of the paper is the following.

in sec. 2, i discuss the nonabelian va-
theory, and in particular the global symmetries of this model. in sec. 3, i discuss the regular-
ization of the quantum theory of the va-theory. the regularization scheme i use is proper time
regularization in minkowski space, where it is seen that the exact specication of the regular-
ization is controlled by a regularization operator d, related to the dirac operator d. i then
discuss various choices for d. in sec. 4, i show that the choice that leads to the wesszumino
consistent bardeen anomaly leads to lorentz and translational invariance. on the other hand,
in sec. 5, i show that the choice that leads to the covariant anomaly is not poincare invariant,
and i calculate the divergence of the angular momentum current and the energy-momentum
current. sec. 6 is a brief conclusion.

2 the va-theory

the nonabelian va-theory is a fairly standard theory of a dirac fermion, and suitable for
illustration of the main points. it is given by the lagrangian

l = (d + i),

d = i6 6 v 6a5  .

(1)

 ta and a = aa

ta are external vector and axial vector sources, respectively, in
here, v = v a
the lie algebra of some group with generators ta. i have added a small mass  as an infrared
regulator, as well as an i. i will usually suppress both of these.

let us consider the global phase rotations

  ei,

  ei,

 = ata,

and chiral rotations

  ei5 ,

  ei5 ,

 = ata.

it is convenient to assign the transformation rules

v  eivei,

a  eiaei,

and

v  ei5vei5,

a  ei5 aei5 .

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

to the external sources since this makes the lagrangian invariant. from these transformation
rules we can derive the naive conservation equations

j a = 0,
j a
5 = 0,

  ta,
j a
  5ta,
j 5a

(6)

2

where j and j 5
 are the fermion current and axial current. (if v and a transformed trivially
under the symmetry, we would nd that these currents were covariantly conserved instead
of ordinarily conserved.) the fact that the symmetry under consideration is global rather
than local means that the anomalies we will discuss in the following sections are symmetry
anomalies rather than gauge anomalies.

translations with the parameter a act on the elds by

  eiap ,
  eiap ,
v  eia p  veia p  ,
a  eia p  aeia p  ,

where p  i are the generators, and lorentz transformations with parameters  act by

on the classical level.

3 quantization

j ,  h 1

(10)

(11)

for the sake of the discussion, it is useful to recall some basics about the quantization of a theory
such as the va-theory. the quantum theory is given by the path integral

z = z dd eir d4x d  detd,

(12)

which also denes the fermionic determinant. the eective action w (z  eiw ) is given by

w = itr ln d.

(13)

these expressions are formal and will become well dened by regularization.

for innitesimal parameters, the rotations of the fermions induce a change in the dirac

operator

d  ei+i5 dei+i5

= d + i(d  d) + i(d5 + 5d)
 d + d,

(14)

3

which in turn induces a change in w :

w = itrd

1
d

.

(15)

the jacobian j is then determined by the requirement that the path integral z is unchanged
under a change of variables:

z = jeiw +iw = eiw .
dening now a lagrangian by j  exp(ir d4xlj ), we have
z d4xlj = w = itrd

1
d

.

lj thus contains the anomalies, ga

 and ga
,

lj  aga

 + aga
,

(16)

(17)

(18)

and is therefore the quantity of interest.

when a regularization is specied, both the transformations (2) and (3) are in general seen
to be broken symmetries. by the noether procedure, we can nd the conservation equations for
the currents:

j a = ga
,
j a
5 = ga
.

(19)

thus, if the anomalies are nonvanishing, the symmetries are violated.

the main point of this paper is that a similar thing may happen to the poincare transfor-

mations. indeed, following the noether procedure, we must consider local variations

for the translations, and

d = i(d 1

2 {a, p }  1

2 {a, p }d)

d = i(d 1

2 { 1

2 , j  }  1

2 { 1

for the lorentz transformations. here i have used the symmetrized products

2 {a, p } = 1
2 { 1

2 , j  } = 1

2 ap  + 1

4 j  ,

(20)

(21)

(22)

which secures hermiticity when a and  are local functions. as i will show, the jacobian
may be nontrivial for this case as well,

lj = ag

leading to the anomalous divergence equations

for the angular momentum current, and

violates poincare symmetry.

 are nonvanishing therefore

4 proper time regularization

the regularization scheme i have used for my calculations is proper time regularization in
minkowski space [5]. traditionally proper time regularization is used in connection with the
euclidean formalism, see e.g. the review [6]. however, it turns out to be a great advantage
to work in minkowski space, when dierent regularizations  consistent, covariant, etc.  are
discussed, since in that case the various prescriptions are conveniently controlled by the choice
of a regularization operator d, related to the dirac operator d. this will be discussed in the
next sections; see also [5]. there is also no need to perform analytical continuations of the elds
and transformations in minkowski space. but other regularization schemes should of course be
possible.

i introduce a proper time integral and the operator d in the following way:

1
z d4xlj = itrd
d
= itrd d
= z 

1/2

1
d d

dstrd deis(d d+i)

(26)

the operator d is a priori arbitrary, except that it must be chosen to give the right -prescription.
this will then ensure convergence at the upper integration limit. for the lower integration limit
the cuto  is introduced, which is to be taken to innity at the end of the calculation. when
the appropriate choice for d is made, lj will be regular and well dened.

we can use the expression for d from eq. (14) to perform the proper time integral and

write r d4xlj in a fujikawa-like form [7, 8]:

z d4xlj = z 

1/2

dstr i(d  d + d5 + 5d) deisd d
 eid d/2(cid:17)  tr 5(cid:16)ei dd/2

= tr (cid:16)ei dd/2

+ eid d/2(cid:17) .

(27)

here i have used the cyclicity of the trace, the identity deisd dd = ddeis dd, and the fact that
only the lower limit of the integral contributes due to the implicit presence of the . similarly,
for the lorentz transformations and translations we have

z d4xlj = tr 1
2 , j  }(cid:16)ei dd/2
2 { 1
2 {a, p }(cid:16)ei dd/2
tr 1

 eid d/2(cid:17)
 eid d/2(cid:17) .

to proceed from here it is necessary to choose a d.

5 consistent regularization

let us make the choice

d = (i5)d(i5).

using the cyclicity of the trace and the fact that 5 commutes with , we have

z d4xlj = 2tr 5ei dd/2

.

5

(28)

(29)

(30)

the terms proportional to  in eq. (27) have thus canceled out.

we can nd out which kind of chiral anomaly this choice of d leads to. after a standard

calculation we get (see e.g. [9])

lj =

here f 

v and f 

a are the bardeen tensors,

f v
f a

  v  v + i[v, v ] + i[a, a ],
  a  a + i[v, a ] + i[a, v],

(31)

(32)

and dv

   + i[v,  ].

the terms proportional to the -tensor is the familiar bardeen anomaly [10]. the other
terms are of even intrinsic parity [11]. (note, incidentally, that it is not possible to remove these
terms by a redenition of the path integral since we are explicitly considering a global symmetry.
only in the case where the chiral transformations are gauge transformations can we remove these
terms by adding a suitable polynomial in v, a, and derivatives, to the lagrangian. this is
because the transformation rules (4) and (5) should then be replaced with gauge transformations,
where in particular a picks up a gradient.) the bardeen anomaly is known to be consistent
[2], hence the regularization resulting from d is a consistent regularization.

actually, this is not the whole story: one also gets a term proportional to 2 (and terms
proportional to 1/2, 1/4,. . .) in addition to the -independent terms in eq. (31). it is necessary
to somehow remove this term if we intend to take  to innity at the end of the calculation.
this can be done by the paulivillars inspired regularization described in [9]; see also [5]. this
implies a theorem that we can simply drop all -dependent terms.

it is easy to see that not only the terms proportional to  in eq. (27) cancel out, but also the
terms proportional to a and  in eq. (28). hence the lorentz and translational anomalies 
g

  vanish for this regularization.

 and ga

6 covariant regularization

let us now instead make the choice

d = dc  cdt c 1.

(33)

this is the charge conjugate of d; c is the charge conjugation matrix and transposition is
with respect to the dirac matrix structure.

it is now no longer true that terms proportional to  in eq. (27) automatically cancel. for
a combination of a phase rotation with parameter  = ata and chiral phase rotation with
parameter  = ata we get

lj =

1

v f 
162 tr(cid:2)(f 
+(f 

a + f 
v f 

a f 
v )
v + f 
a f 
a )(cid:3) .

6

(34)

this is the expression for the covariant anomaly [6].

the presence of a term proportional to  means that the current is not conserved. this is

well known for a theory that is regularized to have a covariant anomaly [6, 1].

this form of d is similar to that of d in the euclidean formulation, where also the sign of
6a5 is changed relative to i6   6 v . in the euclidean case the operator d has a special status,
since it is used for the construction of the positive operators dd and dd. the positivity of
these operators will then ensure the convergence of the upper limit of the proper time integral,
instead of the i which has the same eect in minkowski space. for this reason the euclidean
formalism produces naturally the covariant anomaly, and it takes a considerable amount of
work to produce other anomalies, such as the consistent one [6].

within this regularization, we can now calculate the jacobian that corresponds to the trans-
lations and lorentz transformations. the procedure, which also includes some nonstandard
elements, is essentially the one described in ref. [5], where it was used in a slightly dierent
context. the result is

l =

82  trh 1

a + 1

6 i[v , f 

(cid:3) f 
+ x(2v fv fa + afv fv )i

6 i[a, f 
v ]

 1

2 g



and

la =

1
82 atr(2v fv fa + afv fv )

 ag
a .

(35)

(36)

thus, as advertized, the angular momentum current and energy-momentum tensor are not
conserved, and poincare symmetry is violated.

7 conclusion

we have seen that in the nonabelian va-theory considered in this paper, poincare symmetry
survives quantization for a regularization that leads to the consistent bardeen form of the chiral
anomaly, while it is anomalously broken for a regularization that leads to the covariant chiral
anomaly. of course many other choices for the regularization operator d can be made. (indeed
many other choices than proper time regularization can be made for the regularization scheme
itself.)
in general poincare symmetry is violated since eq. (28) does not vanish for general
choices for d. thus, one lesson to be learned from the calculations in this paper is that it is
necessary to check whether or not poincare symmetry may be anomalously broken when a given
regularization is adopted.

it would be interesting to try to generalize the investigation of poincare symmetry to theories
of chiral fermions. it would also be interesting to investigate if, and how, poincare anomalies
may cancel in gauge theories where the fermion content ensures a cancellation of the chiral
anomalies.
