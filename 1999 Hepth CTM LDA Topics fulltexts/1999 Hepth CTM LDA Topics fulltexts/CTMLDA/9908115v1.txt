abstract

it is shown that a moyal deformation quantization of the so(4k) generalized yang-mills (gym) theory
action in d = 4k dimensions, for spacetime independent eld congurations, in the h  0 limit, yields the
dolan-tchrakian p-brane action after xing the conformal and world volume reparametrization invariance ,
associated with the p-brane world volume dimension p + 1 = 4k, embedded in a d = 4k target spacetime
background. the gauge elds/target spacetime coordinates correspondence is required but no large n limit
is necessary.

i. introduction

recently, conformally invariant sigma models in d = 2n dimensions with target non-compact o(2n, 1)
instanton eld congurations were found to correspond geometrically to conformal
groups were studied.
 stereographic mappings of r2n into euclidean signature ads2n spaces [1]. these conformally invariant
sigma models [2] were of crucial importance in the construction of conformally invariant lagrangians, with
vanishing world volume cosmological constant, for bosonic p-branes, such that p + 1 = 2n [3].

closely related to these conformally invariant sigma models are the so(4k) generalized yang mills
theories (gym) in r4k constructed by tchrakian [4]. hierachies of gauged grassmanian models in 4k
dimensions with self dual instantons were also constructed by tchrakian and manvelyan [4].

nahm equations are directly connected with self dual yang mills equations. moyal deformation quan-
tization of nahm equations, and the toda models in the n   limit, were constructed in [5] and solutions
were found in [6] in relation to matrix models and m theory. deformation quantization has recently captured
a lot of interest in string theory and for this reason we will cosntruct the moyal deformation quantization
of tchrakian so(4k) gym in r4k and show that in the h  0 limit, and for spacetime independent eld
congurations, one will recover the dolan tchrakian actions, after xing the conformal and world volume
reparametrization invariance, for p-branes, p + 1 = 4k, moving in target spacetime backgrounds of dimen-
sionality equal to 4k.

fairlie [6] has emphasized the importance of the large n limit of su (n ) yang-mills theory , for spacetime
independent eld conguartions, in connection with the schild string action. fairlie has raised the interesting
issue that a possible extension of the large n limit to dirac-born-infeld actions, d-branes eective actions.
may also exist. this would pave the road, in a very natural fashion, to a deformation quantization program
to d-branes based on dirac-born-infeld actions.

the standard work on deformation quantization was initiated by [7,8,9]. for the role of fedosov
deformation quantization in w geometry [10]; on the connection between holography and the quantum
geometry of surfaces with moyal quantization see [11]. the importance of w symmetry in the moyal
quantization process was studied in [12]. for recent results on d-branes and deformation quantization and
an extensive list of current references on star products and string theory see [13]. a rigorous mathematical
foundation is given in [14] and a path integral expression of kontsevich quantization was presented in [15].
finally, deformation quantization of coadjoint orbits in semisimple groups we refer to [16]. geometric
induced actions for w gravity, an anomalous eective wznw action, based on a coadjoint orbit method
associated with the moyal deformations of the algebra of dierential operators of the circle was given by
nissimov, pacheva and vaysburd [16].

we start with a few denitions of gym in the next section before performing the moyal quantization
that will allow us to show its relation to the dolan tchrakian construction of p-brane actions. finally we
present our conclusions.

ii. deformation quantization of gym

the generalized yang mills theory (gym) described by tchrakian [4] based on so(4k) in rd where

d = 4k has for dening lagrangian :

l =

1
g2

tr (f 12......n

1 2.......2k12.......2k)2 =

g2

tr (f2  f2......f2)2.

g is a dimensionless coupling constant and

12.......2k = [12 34.......2k1 2k].

(1)

(2)

is the totally antisymmetrized product of k factors of the 22k1  22k1 matrices  corresponding to the
chiral representation of so(4k). for k = 1 one has the usual so(4)  so(3)  so(3) , whose double cover
is su (2)  su (2) :

a moyal deformation quantization of the so(4k) gym assigns a one-to-one map of the self-adjoint
tensor-valued operators, f1.....2k , belonging to the hilbert space of square integrable functions, l2(r2k),
to the c-number tensor-valued functions of the phase space r4k coordinates. the deformation quantization
also assigns a one-to-one map from the commutators of self-adjoint operators [ a, b] to the moyal brackets
{{a, b}} where a = symbol[ a] and b = symbol[ b]. the symbol of a self-adjoint operator a, which assigns
a c-number function of phase space, is dened via the weyl groenewold wigner moyal map (wwgm) [7] :

a(x, q1, p1, .....q2k, p2k)  z d2k < ~q 

~
2| a(x)|~q +

~
2

> e

i~p.~
h .

(6)

in order to evaluate the matrix elements of integrand of (6) one needs to know the representation of the
so(4k) algebra in the hilbert space l2(r2k). due to the fact that the eld strength (1) is given in terms
of antisymmetrized products of su (2) matrices and since the representations of su (2) are known, [5], one
can evaluate explicitly such matrix elements. however.
for our purposes at the moment this will not be
necessary. the wwgm map (6) was used by fairlie to construct solutions to the moyal nahm equations
in 3, 7 dimensions.

the wwgm map associated with f12......2k will be the c-number tensor-valued function of the phase

space variables, in addition to the d = 4k spacetime x coordinates, :

from the denition given by (1,2) it can be written as the antisymmetrized product of the k factors of :

f12......2k(x1, x2, .....x4k; q1, p1, .........q2kp2k).

with :

f12......2k = f[12f3 4 ........f2k1 2k].

f = a  a + {{a, a}}..

2

(7)

(8)

(9)

for the particular case of space-time independent eld congurations the above eld strengths become :

f12......2k = {{a1, a2}}  {{a3, a4}}  .......................  {{a2k1 , a2k}}.

(10)

the moyal star product in the r4k phase space is dened as :

a  b =



(

xk=0

ih
2

)k 1
k!

i1j1 i2j2 .....ikjk (i1i2.....ik a)(j1 j2.....jkb).

and the moyal bracket is

{{a, b}} =

1
h

(a  b  b  a)

(11a)

(11b)

where ij are the components of the inverse tensor of the symplectic two-form ij. in the classical h  0
limit, the moyal bracket reduces to the poisson bracket. the trace over the lie algebra indices is converted,
after the wwgm prescription, into an integral over the f lat phase space coordinates. the relevance of
the moyal quantization, and a subsequent h  0 limit, is that no large n   limit is required in the
associated so(2n ), su (n ) yang mills theories. for example. no    matrices are needed. the h  0
limit will render the poisson bracket area-preserving dis algebra automatically. see garcia-compean et al
[5].

when the phase space is curved the moyal deformation quantization needs to be replaced by a defor-
mation quantization program described by fedosov [9] that takes into account the fact that the ordinary
moyal star product in curved phase space is no longer associative. a geometric derivation of w gravity
from fedosov deformation quantization and the reason why the string coordinates inherit a noncommutative
product structure, among other things, was given in [10].

now, taking into account the special case of independent spacetime eld congurations, the action
associated with the moyal quantization of the so(4k) gym in r4k factorizes into a product of a space-time
volume and an integral over phase space variables. corresponding to the trace over the lie algebra elements
:

4k

g2 z d2kq d2kp [{{a1 , a2}}  {{a3, a4}}  .......................  {{a2k1 , a2k}}]2.

(12)

the classical limit h = 0 of the moyal bracket yields the poisson bracket . represented by a single bracket
symbol. hence, in the h = 0 limit the action for the vacuum space time independent eld congurations
beomes :

4k

g2 z d2kq d2kp [{a1 , a2}  {a3, a4}  .......................  {a2k1 , a2k}]2.

(13)

if one equates the at phase space coordinates, q1, p1, .....q2k, p2k with the coordinates of the 4k-dimensional
world volume of a p-brane such that p + 1 = 4k : 1 = q1, 2 = p1, ....4k1 = q2k, 4k = p2k and establishes
the spacetime independent gauge elds/ coordinate correspondence : a()  1
x() , with lp the
planck length in the appropriate dimension, we will see that the above action (13) is nothing but the dolan-
tchrakian action for a p-brane moving in target spacetime backgrounds of dimension 4k, for the values of
p + 1 = 4k, upon xing the conformal and world volume reparametrization invariance . let us take without
loss of generality the case k = 1 associated with a p = 3-brane whose world volume if four dimensional. the
h  0 limit yields in (13) :

l2
p

4
g2l8

p z d4 [{x1, x2}]2 =

4
g2l8

p z d4 i1j1 i2j2 i1 x 1j1 x 2i2 x1 j2 x2 .

(14a)

where ij is the inverse of the symplectic form used to dene the poisson bracket. in a canonical basis it
can be represented by a 4  4 antisymmetric matrix comprised of two block antisymmetric 2  2 matrices
with 1 entries o the diagonal, respectively. the action in (14a) becomes

4
g2l8

p z d4 [([q1 x 1p1]x 2) + ([q2 x 1p2]x 2)]2.

(14b)

3

the conformally invariant dolan-tchrakian action [3] for a p = 3-brane whose world volume is four

dimensional embedded in a four dimensional target spacetime background is :

t z d4 h h11h22[1 x 12]x 2[1x1 2]x2 .

the action is conformal invariant under the transformations of the world volume auxiliary metric :

h12  eh12 . h12  eh12 . h  e2h.

(15)

(16)

in the conformal gauge one xes the metric to be conformally at (euclidean) : h12 = e12 where
12 is the (euclidean) four dimensional world volume metric. the above action (15) in the conformal
gauge becomes nally :

t z d4 1122[1 x 12]x 2 [1x12]x2 = t z d4 [[1 x 12]x 2]2.

(17)

finally, if one xes the 4-dimensional ( euclidean) world volume reparametrization invariance of the
dolan-tcrakian action by choosing the analog of the orthonormal gauge in the dirac-nambu-goto string (
for euclidean world sheets) :

(x )( x) = . ,  = 1, 2, 3, 4.

(18)

the lagrangian density of (17) becomes a constant. and similarily, after making the identication : 1 =
q1, 2 = p1, 3 = q2, 4 = p2, the lagrangian density in (14b) also becomes a constant after using the
orthonormality conditions of eq-(18). the fact that one can gauge the lagrangian density to a constant is
due to the fact that a p-brane moving in a background of d = p + 1 = 4k dimensions does not have local
transverse degrees of freedom : dp1 = 0. in that sense the theory is topological. we must emphasize that
the action (14) is not the schild action because the latter is the action for a string, a two-dim world sheet,
whereas the action in (14) is truly a four-dim one. the schild action is area-preserving dieomorphisms
invariant but it is not fully reparametrization invariant like the dolan-tchrakian p-brane actions.

therefore, to sum up, the action (14) obtained from a moyal deformation quantization of a so(4) yang
mills theory in r4, in the h  0 limit, for spacetime independent eld congurations, is equivalent to the
dolan-tchrakian action (17) after xing the conformal and world volume reparametrization invariance. if,
and only if, one equates the p = 3-brane tension ( up to a numerical factor) to :

t3 

4
g2l8
p

.

(19)

4 is the four dimensional spacetime volume of r4 where the so(4) yang mills theory is dened. to
regularize quantities like the volume we could select a compact spacetime.

it is important to emphasize that x 6= x. the base manifold coordinates over which one denes
the so(4k) gym must not be confused with the target spacetime embedding coordinates of the p-brane
(p + 1 = 4k). the gauge elds a, after the moyal quantization and the h = 0 limit, are the ones that
behave like the p-brane coordinates. in general, the p-brane tension, where p + 1 = 4k, up to a k-dependent
numerical constant, is then :

tp 

4k
g2l8k
p

.

(20)

and the moyal deformation quantization of the so(4k) generalized yang mills theory (gym), for spacetime
independent eld congurations, in the h  0 limit, is :

4k
g2l8k

p z d4k [{x1 , x2}  {x3, x4}  .......................  {x2k1 , x2k}]2.

(21)

similar arguments as the k = 1 case will allow us to show that the action given by (21) will be equivalent to
the dolan tchrakian p-brane action, with p + 1 = 4k, moving in target spacetime backgrounds of d = 4k

4

after xing the conformal gauge and world volume reparametrization invariance ; i.e for conformally at
4k-dim world volumes and using the orthonormal gauge conditions (18) where the indices now run over 4k
values :

t z d4k h h11 h22........h4k 4k [1x 12 x 2.....4k ]x 4k [1x1 2x2 .....4k]x4k .

(22)

conclusions

after showing the equivalence of the moyal deformation quantization of the gym and p-branes, under
certain special conditions, spacetime independent eld congurations, h = 0 limit....it is worth exploring
other cases besides the d = 4k. in particular, the deformation quantization of nambu-poisson mechanics
associated with general pbranes has been studied by dito et al [17]. p-brane quantum mechanical wave
equations have been given in [18].
the role of w geometry [10], and the extension of the vertex operator algebras to w conformal
field theory, in connection with higher spin theories in ads backgrounds and n = 8 higher spin super-
gravity, the eld theory limit of m theory on ads4  s7, deserves further attention [19.20]. the p-brane
tensions appearing in this work have a typical stringy instanton behaviour 1
g2 . it is warranted to study how
d-branes t in this formalism of moyal-fedosov deformation quantization. the d-brane tensions have a
1
g behaviour. the wznw actions associated with open-strings in group manifolds with an antisymmetric
rank two tensor background, and dirac-born-infeld eective actions discussed in [6,13] should be a starting
point.

finally, more general cases ought to be investigated other than the restricted spacetime independent
eld congurations; the fact that the number of spacetime dimensions 4k equals that of the phase space
variables suggests a complexif ication of the 4k-world volume coordinates and background spacetime and,
correspondingly, of the gauge elds.
