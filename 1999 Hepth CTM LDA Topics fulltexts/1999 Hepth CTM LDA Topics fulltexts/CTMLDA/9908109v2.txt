black hole solutions that are asymptotic to ads5  s5 or ads4  s7 can
rotate in two dierent ways. if the internal sphere rotates then one can ob-
tain a reissner-nordstrom-ads black hole. if the asymptotically ads space
rotates then one can obtain a kerr-ads hole. one might expect superradiant
scattering to be possible in either of these cases. superradiant modes reected
o the potential barrier outside the hole would be re-amplied at the horizon,
and a classical instability would result. we point out that the existence of
a killing vector eld timelike everywhere outside the horizon prevents this
from occurring for black holes with negative action. such black holes are also
thermodynamically stable in the grand canonical ensemble. the cft duals
of these black holes correspond to a theory in an einstein universe with a
chemical potential and a theory in a rotating einstein universe. we study
these cfts in the zero coupling limit. in the rst case, bose-einstein con-
densation occurs on the boundary at a critical value of the chemical potential.
however the supergravity calculation demonstrates that this is not to be ex-
pected at strong coupling.
in the second case, we investigate the limit in
which the angular velocity of the einstein universe approaches the speed of
light at nite temperature. this is a new limit in which to compare the cft
at strong and weak coupling. we nd that the free cft partition function
and supergravity action have the same type of divergence but the usual factor
of 4/3 is modied at nite temperature.

i. introduction

black holes in asymptotically at space are often thought of as completely dead classi-
cally. that is, they can absorb radiation and energy, but not give any out. however, in 1969,
penrose devised a classical process to extract energy from a rotating black hole [1]. this
is possible because the horizon is rotating faster than light with respect to the stationary
frame at innity. in other words, the killing vector k that is time like at innity is space like
on the horizon. the energy-momentum ux vector j  = t 
 k can therefore also be space
like, even for matter obeying the dominant energy condition. thus the energy ow across
the future horizon of a rotating black hole can be negative: the penrose process extracts
rotational energy from the hole and slows its spin. this shows that rotating black holes are
potentially unstable.

a nice way of extracting rotational energy is to scatter a wave o the black hole [2,3]. part
of the incoming wave will be absorbed, and will change the mass and angular momentum of
the hole. by the rst law of black hole mechanics

dm =


8

da + dj,

(1.1)

the changes in mass and angular momentum determine the change in area of the horizon.
the second law

da  0

(1.2)

states that the area will increase in classical scattering for elds that obey the dominant
energy condition. for a wave of frequency,  and axial quantum number m the change of
mass and the change of angular momentum obey

dm
dj

=


m

.

(1.3)

the rst and second second laws imply that the change of energy of the black hole is negative
when

 < m.

(1.4)

in other words, instead of part of the incident wave being absorbed by the black hole and
part reected back, the reected wave would actually be stronger than the original incoming
wave. such amplied scattering is called superradiance.

in a purely classical theory, a black hole is wont lose angular momentum to massless
elds like gravity. it is a dierent story, however, with massive elds. a mass term  for a
scalar eld, will prevent waves of frequency  <  from escaping to innity. instead they
will be reected by a potential barrier at large radius back into the hole. if they satisfy
the condition for superradiance then the waves will be amplied by scattering o the hole.
each time the wave is reected back, its amplitude will be larger. thus the wave will grow
exponentially and the black hole will lose its angular momentum by a classical process.

one can understand this instability in the following way. in the wkb limit, a mode
with  <  corresponds to a gravitationally bound particle. if its orbital angular velocity

2

is less than the angular velocity of the black hole then angular momentum and energy will
ow from the hole to the particle. orbits in asymptotically at space can have arbitrarily
long periods so rotating at space black holes will always lose angular momentum to massive
elds, although in practice the rate is very low.

charged elds scattering o an electrically charged black hole have similar superradiant

amplication [46]. the condition is now

 < q,

(1.5)

where q is the charge of the eld and  the electrostatic potential dierence between the
horizon and innity. there is, however, an important dierence from the rotating case.
black holes with regular horizons, obey a bogolomony bound, that their charges are not
greater than their masses, with equality only in the bps extreme state. this bound implies
that the electro static repulsion between charged black holes, can never be greater than
their mutual gravitational attraction. the bogolomony bound on the charge of a black hole
implies that   1 in asymptotically at space.
in a kaluza-klein or super symmetric
theory, the charges of elds will generally obey the same bps bound as black holes, with
respect to their rest mass i.e.   q. this means the inequality for superradiance can never
be satised. one can think of this as a consequence of the fact that the bps bound implies
that gauge repulsions never dominate over gravitational attraction. it means that charged
black holes in supersymmetric and kaluza klein theories are classically stable. the black
hole cant lose charge by sending out a charged particle while maintaining the area of the
horizon, as it must in a classical process.

so far we have been discussing superradiance and stability of black holes in asymptotically
at space. however, it should also be interesting to study holes in anti-de sitter space
because the ads/cft duality [79] relates the properties of these holes to thermal properties
of a dual conformal eld theory living on the boundary of ads [9,10]. a ve dimensional ads
analogue of the kerr solution was constructed in [11]. reissner-nordstrom-ads (rnads)
solutions of type iib supergravity were derived in [12]1. these holes carry kaluza-klein
charge coming from the rotation of an internal s5. the charged and rotating holes, although
appearing rather dierent in four or ve dimensions, therefore appear quite similar from the
perspective of ten or eleven dimensional kk theory: one rotates in the ads space and the
other in the internal space. one aim of this paper is to investigate whether these rotating
black holes exhibit superradiance and instability and what that implies for the dual cft.
this cft lives on the conformal boundary of our black hole spacetimes, which is an einstein
universe.

the kerr-ads solution is discussed in section ii. we nd that a superradiant instability is
possible only when the einstein universe on the boundary rotates faster than light. however

1 more general charged black hole solutions of gauged supergravity theories have also been dis-
cussed in [13,14] and their embedding in ten and eleven dimensions was studied in [15]. thermo-
dynamic properties of charged ads holes have been discussed in [12,1621]. the thermodynamics
of kerr-newman-ads black holes in four dimensions was recently discussed in [22].

3

this can only occur when the black hole is suppressed in the supergravity partition function
relative to pure ads.

we discuss the rnads solutions in section iii. we point out that it is not possible for
the internal s5 to rotate faster than light in these solutions and therefore superradiance
in particular this means that the
cannot occur, contrary to speculations made in [12].
extremal black holes, although not supersymmetric, are classically stable.
it is possible
for the internal s5 to rotate faster than light in ads5  s5. however such solutions have
higher action than the corresponding rnads solution (in a grand canonical ensemble) and
are therefore suppressed in the supergravity partition function and do not aect the phase
structure of the strongly coupled cft.

a second aim of this paper is to compare the behaviour of the cft at strong and weak
coupling. it was pointed out in [23] that the entropy of the strongly coupled theory (in at
space) is precisely 3/4 that of the free theory - the surprise being that there is no dependence
on the thooft parameter  or the number of colours n. it has also been noticed that the
casimir energy is the same for the free and strongly coupled theories [24]. this suggests
that turning up the temperature is similar to turning up the coupling.

we study the boundary cft using a grand canonical ensemble. in the charged case, this
corresponds to turning on a chemical potential for a u(1) subgroup of the so(6) r-symmetry
group. in the rotating case, there are chemical potentials constraining the cft elds to
rotate in the einstein universe.
in the free cft, a u(1) chemical potential would cause
bose condensation at a critical value. this is not apparent in the strongly coupled theory,
which instead exhibits a rst order phase transition. bose condensation has been discussed
in the context of spinning branes [25,26] but these discussions have referred to cfts in at
space, for which the energy of massless elds starts at zero and bose condensation would
occur for any non-zero chemical potential.

the rotating case was studied at high temperature in [11,27].

it was found that the
factor of 3/4 relating the free and strongly coupled cfts persists, even though there are
extra dimensionless parameters present that could have aected the result [27]. at high
temperature the nite radius of the spatial sections of the einstein universe is negligible so
the theory behaves as if it were in at space. in the rotating case there is a new limit in
which to study the behaviour of the cft, namely the limit in which the angular velocity
of the universe tends to the speed of light. we nd that the divergences in the partition
functions of the free and strongly coupled cfts are of the same form at nite temperature
in this limit. we also examine how the 3/4 factor is modied at nite temperature.

ii. bulk and boundary rotation

the three parameter kerr-ads solution in ve dimensions was given in [11]. we shall
start by reviewing the properties of this solution, which is expected to be dual to the thermal
properties of a strongly coupled cft in a rotating einstein universe. we then investigate
classical and thermodynamic stability. finally we calculate the partition function of the
free cft in a rotating einstein universe in order to compare the properties of the strongly
coupled and free theories.

the action of the hole relative to an ads background is calculated by considering the

b. stability of kerr-ads

in an asymptotically at kerr background there is a unique (up to normalization) killing
vector eld timelike near innity i.e. k = /t. near the horizon there is an ergosphere -
a region where k becomes spacelike, and energy extraction through superradiance becomes
possible for modes satisfying equation 1.4. in ads, superradiance would correspond to an
instability of the hole. this is because superradiant modes would be reected back towards
the hole by a potential barrier (in the case of massive elds) or boundary conditions at
innity (for massless elds) and reamplied at the horizon before being scattered again.
the hole would be classically unstable and would lose angular momentum to a cloud of
particles orbiting it. the spectrum of elds in ads is discrete, and one might expect the
threshold value of  for superradiance to be given by the minimum of /|m| for elds in the
black hole background. however the presence of a black hole changes the spectrum from

6

discrete to continuous (since regularity at the origin is no longer required) and it is not
clear whether a positive lower bound exists. fortunately there is a simple argument that
demostrates the stability of kerr-ads for |i| < 1.
in kerr-ads, if |i| < 1 then the corotating killing vector eld  is timelike everywhere
outside the horizon, so there is a corotating frame that exists all the way out to innity (in
contrast with the situation in at space, where any rigidly rotating frame, will necessarily
move faster than light far from the axis of rotation). the energy-momentum vector in this
frame is j  = t 
 . if the matter obeys the dominant energy condition [29] then this is
non-spacelike everywhere outside the horizon. let  be a spacelike hypersurface from the
horizon to innity with normal n. the total energy of matter on  is

d4xhnj ,

e = z

(2.13)

where h is the determinant of the induced metric on . the integrand is everywhere non-
positive so e  0. the normal to the horizon is , so the energy ux density across the
horizon is j , which is non-positive. if suitable boundary conditions are imposed then
energy will not enter the spacetime from innity. this means that if e is evaluated on
another surface  lying to the future of  then

e()  e(),

(2.14)

that is, e is non-increasing function that is bounded below by zero. energy cannot be
extracted from the hole: it is classically stable.

when 2

i > 1, the corotating killing vector eld does become spacelike in a region near
innity: this region rotates faster than light. the above argument then breaks down and
an instability may occur. there are two dierent limits in which 2
i  1 [11]. the rst
i  1, which makes the metric become singular. the second is r2
is a2
+  ai for which the
metric remains regular. in fact there is a range of r2
+ < ai for which 2
i > 1. however since
ai < 1, these black holes all have r+ < 1 and hence have positive action. they are therefore
suppressed relative to ads in the supergravity partition function, so even if these holes are
unstable, the instability will not aect the phase structure of the cft, although it may be
of interest in its own right.

we have demonstrated the absence of a classical instability when |i| < 1. however
we have not yet discussed thermodynamic stability. in order to uniquely dene the grand
canonical ensemble, the legendre transformation from the extensive variables (m, j1, j2) to
the intensive variables (t, 1, 2) must be single-valued. if this legendre transformation be-
comes singular then the grand-canonical ensemble becomes ill-dened. it is straightforward
to calculate the determinant of the jacobian:

det

(t, 1, 2)
(e, j1, j2)

= det

(t, 1, 2)
(r+, a1, a2)

/ det

where the ellipsis denotes a group of terms that is easily seen to be positive. the quantity
in square brackets must also be positive in order for a black hole solution to exist (as can
be seen from equation 2.11). therefore equation 2.16 cannot be satied. the numerator in
equation 2.15 vanishes if, and only if,

the right hand side is positive for r+ > 1. it has a negative minimum at a value of r+ between
0 and 1 and is positive at r+ = 0 so there must be two roots between 0 and 1. let r0 denote
the larger of these two roots. black holes with r+ > r0 are locally thermodynamically stable.
however only those with r+ > 1 have negative action, so the holes with r0 < r+ < 1 are only
metastable. the requirement of an invertible legendre transformation therefore does not
aect the phase structure obtained from the action calculation. four dimensional kerr-ads
black holes behave in the same way [22].

c. free cft in a rotating einstein universe

the high temperature limit of free elds in a rotating einstein universe was recently
investigated in [11,27]. the usual factor of 4/3 between the strongly coupled and free cfts
was found to persist [27]. we wish to investigate a dierent limit, namely i  1 at
nite temperature. at nite temperature, the nite size of the s3 spatial sections of the
einstein universe becomes signicant. to compute the partition function we need to know
the spectrum of the cft elds in the einstein universe.

i

i

and j (r)

i + j (r)

, where j (l)

the einstein universe has isometry group r  so(4) = r  su(2)  su(2), so we
may classify representations of the isometry group according to the casimirs (, jl, jr) of
r and the two su(2)s. the little group is so(3) = su(2)/z2. the generators of this
group are ji = j (l)
are the generators of the two su(2) groups.
therefore the so(3) content of the representations of the isometry group is given by angular
momentum addition. the irreducible representation (, jl, jr) will give a sum of irreducible
representations of the little group, with |jl  jr|  j  jl + jr. the lowest eigenvalue
j = |jl  jr| is regarded as the spin. therefore irreducible representations of the form
(, j, j  s) describe particles of spin s. parity invariance is obtained by taking the direct
sum (, j, j + s) + (, j + s, j). these representations may be promoted to representations
of the conformal group provided  is suitably related to j and s. the allowed values of 
can be obtained by solving conformally invariant wave equations on the einstein universe.
alternatively they can be solved on ads4, which is conformal to half of the einstein universe.
this was done in [30]. the scalar modes on ads4 can be extended to modes on the einstein
universe. there are two dierent complete sets of modes on ads4 however both sets are
required for completeness on the einstein universe. the same happens for modes of higher
spin.

the scalar modes form the representations (j, j) of su(2)  su(2). the energy eigen-
values are given by  = j + 1 where j = 2j. the spin-1/2 modes form the representations

8

(j, j + 1/2) + (j + 1/2, j) and have  = j + 1 where j = 2j + 1/2. the spin-1 modes form
the representations (j, j + 1) + (j + 1, j) with  = j + 1 and j = 2j + 1. in all cases the
allowed values of j are 0, 1/2, 1, . . .. we have not taken account of the casimir energy of the
elds because we have measured all energies relative to ads rather than using the boundary
counterterm method [24] to calculate the supergravity action.

the killing vector elds of the einstein universe form a representation of the lie algebra
of the isometry group with /1 = j (l)
. thus the quantum
numbers corresponding to rotations in the 1 and 2 directions are ml  mr and ml + mr
respectively.
we can now compute the partition functions for the cft elds. in the grand canonical

where the upper sign is for the bosons and the lower sign for the fermions. using the energy

where  = 1  2, the j-summation runs over integer values and we have reversed the

note that all of these diverge as i  1. at rst sight this looks like bose-einstein
condensation (since i is a chemical potential) but this is misleading. the divergence does
not arise from the lowest bosonic energy level but from summing over all of the modes (in
particular the modes with largest +ml + mr for each j [11]). furthermore the fermion
partition function also diverges, so this is certainly not a purely bosonic eect.

the particle content of the n = 4 u(n) super yang-mills theory is n 2 gauge bosons,
4n 2 majorana fermions and 6n 2 scalars. adding the appropriate contributions from these
elds, one obtains the following asymptotic behaviour for the free cft as 1  1:

the divergences as i  1 are of the same form at all temperatures. we are interested
in comparing these divergences as for the free and strongly coupled cfts. the partition
function for the strongly coupled cft is given by the bulk supergravity partition function.
for r+ > 1 this is dominated by the kerr-ads solution. to compare with the free cft results
we introduce the stringy parameters. the ve dimensional newton constant is related to the
ten dimensional one by 1/g5 = 3/g10, where the numerator is simply the volume of the
internal s5. we are still using units for which the ads length scale is unity, which means
that 1/4ls = 1 when we appeal to the ads/cft correspondence. the ten-dimensional
newton constant is related to the cft parameters by g10 = 4/(2n 2) so g5 = /(2n 2).
the supergravity action can then be written

2this can be justied by cutting o the j summation at j = j0, proceeding as described in the
text and letting j0   at the end.

recall that in the bulk theory there are two ways to take i  1. however one of these
corresponds to a black hole suppressed relative to ads. we must therefore use the other
limit, namely ai  1. it is convenient to use r+ and ai instead of  and i when comparing
the partition functions for the strongly coupled and free cfts. the divergent factors in the
free cft are

so both the strongly coupled and free cfts have divergences proportional to (1  a2
log z as ai  1. this generalizes the high temperature results of [11,27].

is plotted as a function of r+ for several cases of interest in gure 1. at large r+,   0,
so the radius of the s3 is much larger than that of the s1 of the euclidean time direction.
the theory behaves as if it were in at space. this is why one recovers the at space
result [23] f (, 0, 0) = 3/4. the surprise pointed out in [27] is that this is independent
of ai i.e. f (, a1, a2) = 3/4. we have been studying a dierent limit, namely ai  1. a

11

priori there is no reason why this should commute with the high temperature limit but it
is straightforward to use the above expressions to show that this is in fact the case, so all
of the curves in gure 1 approach 3/4 at large r+. at lower temperatures, there is still not
much dependence of f on ai. what is perhaps more surprising is how rapidly f approaches
3/4: f > 0.7 for r+ = 5.5, which corresponds to   0.58 (for all ai) so the radii of the
time and spatial directions are of the same order of magnitude and one might have expected
nite size eects to be more important than they appear.

d. the four dimensional case

the ads/cft correspondence relates the worldvolume theory of n m2-branes in the
large n limit to eleven dimensional supergravity on s7. four dimensional kerr-ads black
holes are expected to be dual to the worldvolume cft in a rotating three dimensional
einstein universe. for completeness we present the free cft results for this case. the cft
is a free supersingleton eld theory [31]. there are eight real scalar elds and eight majorana
spin-1/2 elds. the energy levels of these elds are  = j + 1/2 where j = 0, 1, . . . for the
scalars and j = 1/2, 3/2, . . . for the fermions [32]. the partition functions can be evaluated
as above. for the scalars one obtains



j

xj=0
log z0 = 
xn=1

=



xm=j

log(1  e(j+1/2m))

cosh(n/2)

2n sinh(n(1  )/2) sinh(n(1 + )/2)

,

(2.32)

and for the fermions,



j

log(1 + e(j+1/2m))

log z1/2 =

=

xm=j



xj=1/2
xn=1

()n+1 cosh(n/2)

2n sinh(n(1  )/2) sinh(n(1 + )/2)

thus the partition function for the free cft of an m2-brane is

log z = 8 xn odd

cosh(n/2)

n sinh(n(1  )/2) sinh(n(1 + )/2)

at high temperature, one obtains

the divergence is of the same form as that obtained from the bulk supergravity action in
the limit |a|  1 [11].

iii. bulk charge and boundary chemical potential

it was shown in [12] how to obtain einstein-maxwell theory with a negative cosmological
constant from kk reduction of iib supergravity on s5. the reduction ansatz for the metric
is3

ds2 = gdxdx +

3

xi=1

[d2

i + 2

i (di + adx)2],

(3.1)

where g is a ve dimensional metric, i are direction cosines on the s5 (so p3

i = 1)
and the i are rotation angles on s5 in three orthogonal planes (when embedded in r6).
non-vanishing a corresponds to rotating the s5 by equal amounts in each of these three
planes, and gives a maxwell electromagnetic potential in ve dimensions after kk reduction.
the ansatz for the ramond-ramond 5-form is given in [12].

i=1 2

a. ads5  s5 with electrostatic potential

the simplest solution of the einstein-maxwell system with negative cosmological con-

stant is ads5 with metric

where

ds2 = u(r)dt2 + u(r)1dr2 + r2d2

3

u(r) = 1 + r2

(3.2)

(3.3)

and a constant electrostatic potential a = dt with  =const. increasing  corresponds
to increasing the angular velocity of the internal s5. a point at xed i and i on the s5
moves on an orbit of k = /t. this has norm

k2 = u(r) + 2,

(3.4)

3we have rescaled the electromagnetic potential relative to that of [12].

13

so k will be spacelike in a region near r = 0 when 2 > 1. this means that the s5
rotates faster than light near the origin in ads5 when  is large. the t-direction becomes
spacelike and an internal direction becomes timelike, indicating an instability.
if a bps
particle were added to this solution in the grand ensemble then, near the origin, its negative
electric potential energy would exceed its rest mass, so the most probable conguration
would involve an innite number of particles.

in the ads/cft correspondence, a bulk electromagnetic potential a couples to a con-
served current of the boundary theory [8,9]. in our case, the electromagnetic potential is
associated with the u(1) obtained by taking equal charges for the three u(1) groups in
the u(1)3 cartan subalgebra of the so(6) kk gauge group. the cft current is therefore
obtained by taking the same u(1) subgroup of the u(1)3 cartan subalgebra of the su(4) r-
symmetry group of the boundary cft. the coupling of the bulk gauge eld to the boundary
current is aiji, where

ji = r2

kik + fermions

xk=1
xk=1(cid:16)x 2k1ix 2k  x 2kix 2k1(cid:17) + fermions

3

=

(3.5)

where x k are the usual scalar elds of the n = 4 su(n) super yang-mills theory and
there is a suppressed sum over n. the fermionic contribution should be straightforward to
calculate although we shall not do so.

taking a = dt corresponds to turning on a chemical potential  for the u(1) charge
in the boundary theory. in the free cft, bose-einstein condensation will result when this
chemical potential equals the lowest bosonic energy level, which is  = 1 (see section ii c).
thus be condensation occurs in the free cft when  = 1 (the two signs refer to particles
and anti-particles respectively). this is precisely the critical value of  for which the internal
sphere rotates at the speed of light.

b. reissner-nordstrom-ads black holes

solutions of type iib supergravity describing reissner-nordstrom-ads black holes with

an internal s5 were given in [12]. the ve dimensional metric can be written

ds2 = v (r)dt2 + v (r)1dr2 + r2d2

horizon radii. the electromagnetic potential in a gauge regular on the outer horizon is

once again we can compute the norm of the killing vector eld k = /t with respect to
the 10-dimensional metric. this is

(3.10)

and this is negative for r > r+. hence the internal s5 never rotates faster than light outside
the black hole: there is an everywhere timelike killing vector eld outside the hole. the
stability argument we used for kerr-ads can be therefore also be applied in this case to
conclude that energy extraction from rnads black holes is impossible.

the action i of the black hole relative to ads is [12]

i =


8g5

(r2

+(1  (r+)2)  r4
+)

where the inverse temperature is

 =

2r+

1  (r+)2 + 2r2

+

.

(3.11)

(3.12)

this action can be related to the thermal partition function of the strongly coupled gauge
theory on the boundary [9,10]. we are interested in the partition function in the grand
canonical ensemble, for which the chemical potential and temperature are xed on the
boundary. the phase diagram was given in [12] and reproduced in gure 2. there is a
region near the origin of the   t plane for which i is positive so ads is preferred over
the black hole. everywhere else, i is negative so the hole is preferred. a rst order phase
transition occurs when i changes sign. note that the internal sphere does not reach the speed

15

of light anywhere in this diagram. the closest one can get is to let t tend to zero whilst
increasing  to the critical value in ads. as soon as the critical value is reached, an extreme
black hole of vanishing horizon radius becomes preferred over pure ads. thermodynamic
stability of rnads was discussed in [21]. in the grand canonical ensemble, it was found
that black holes with positive action are stable.

this phase diagram is very dierent from that of the free boundary cft, which only
has a phase transition at the critical value of . the strongly coupled cft does not exhibit
a phase transition as the chemical potential is increased at high temperature, unlike the
free cft. thus at nite chemical potential, the thermal partition functions of the free and
strongly coupled cfts in an einstein universe dier by much more than a simple numerical
factor, even at high temperature.

in four dimensions the situation is identical. the lowest bosonic energy level is  = 1/2
(see section ii d) so bose condensation in the free eld theory occurs at  = 1/2, which
is the critical value for the internal sphere in ads4  s7 to rotate at the speed of light
(the kk ansatz for the four dimensional case was given in [12]). the phase structure of
the strongly coupled theory is qualitatively identical the the one in gure 2 except that the
phase transition occurs at  = 1/2 on the t = 0 axis.

iv. discussion

we have studied the stability of rotating asymptotically ads5s5 and ads4s7 solutions
of supergravity. a classical instability can occur if either the boundary of the ads space
or the internal s5 rotates faster than light. however this occurs only when the solution
has positive action relative to ads and is therefore suppressed in the supergravity partition
function. reissner-nordstrom-ads solutions do not exhibit a superradiant instability but
small kerr-ads solutions may do, although a proof would involve studying wave equations
in kerr-ads. we have also studied quantum local thermodynamic stability and found that
the solutions that are not locally stable have positive action. ads space is preferred in the
domain of the black hole parameters for which the holes are locally unstable. this is to be
contrasted with the charged black holes of [19], for which there was a region of parameter
space in the grand canonical ensemble where the black holes were preferred over ads but
not locally stable.

we have compared the strongly coupled coupled and free boundary cfts in an einstein
universe. when the einstein universe rotates, we nd that the free and strongly coupled
theories have the same type of divergence as the angular velocities approach the speed of
light at nite temperature. the factor of 3/4 relating the partition functions is recovered
at high temperature in the einstein universe since then the radius of curvature of the s3
spatial sections is negligible compared with the radius of curvature of the euclidean time
direction. that this factor is independent of the angular velocities at high temperature was
noticed in [27]; we have found that it does not vary greatly with angular velocity at lower
temperatures either.

free eld theory in the einstein universe is not a good guide to the properties of the
strongly coupled theory at nite u(1) chemical potential since the former would undergo
bose condensation at a critical chemical potential whereas the latter does not. studying this
in the einstein universe allows us to avoid the problems associated with chemical potentials

16

in cfts in at space. the critical chemical potential at which bose condensation occurs is
the value of the potential for which the internal sphere in ads5  s5 rotates at the speed of
light. however the phase transition in the strongly coupled theory only occurs at this value
in the limit of zero temperature.
