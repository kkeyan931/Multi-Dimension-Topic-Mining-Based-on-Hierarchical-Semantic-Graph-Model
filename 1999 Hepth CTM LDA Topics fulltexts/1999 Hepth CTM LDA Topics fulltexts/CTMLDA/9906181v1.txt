we have analyzed the unruh problem in the frame of quantum eld theory and have shown
that the unruh quantization scheme is valid in the double rindler wedge rather than in minkowski
spacetime. the double rindler wedge is composed of two disjoint regions (r- and l-wedges of
minkowski spacetime) which are causally separated from each other. moreover the unruh construc-
tion implies existence of boundary condition at the common edge of r- and l-wedges in minkowski
spacetime. such boundary condition may be interpreted as a topological obstacle which gives rise
to a superselection rule prohibiting any correlations between r- and l- unruh particles. thus the
part of the eld from the l-wedge in no way can inuence a rindler observer living in the r-wedge
and therefore elimination of the invisible left degrees of freedom will take no eect for him. hence
averaging over states of the eld in one wedge can not lead to thermalization of the state in the
other. this result is proved both in the standard and algebraic formulations of quantum eld theory
and we conclude that principles of quantum eld theory does not give any grounds for existence of
the unruh eect.

i. introduction

it was proposed more than 20 years ago that a detector moving with constant proper acceleration in empty
minkowski spacetime (ms) responses as if it had been immersed into thermal bath of fulling particles at davies
- unruh temperature [1,2]

tdu =

g

2ckb

,

(1.1)

where g is proper acceleration of the observer and kb is boltzmann constant. moreover it is claimed that such response
is universal in the sense that it is the same for any kind of the detector. this statement is now referred as the unruh
eect, see e.g. refs. [313] and citation therein. more precisely the unruh eect means that from the point of view
of a uniformly accelerated observer the usual vacuum in ms occurs to be a mixed state described by thermal density
matrix with eective temperature (1.1). in this paper we will give a critical analysis of this statement and will show
that fundamental principles of quantum eld theory do not give any physical grounds to assert that the unruh eect
exists.

in fact there are two aspects of the unruh problem: (i) behaviour of a particular accelerated detector and (ii)
interpretation of properties of quantum eld restricted to a subregion of ms. the second aspect seems to be more
fundamental since one doesnt need to consider the structure of the detector and details of its interaction with the
quantum eld. indeed the original derivation of the unruh eect [1] (see also the later publications [37]) is based only
on quantum eld theory principles and use some special models of detectors only as illustration. moreover exactly
this approach gives grounds for the assertion about the universality of the detector response.

in this paper we will deal basically with the quantum eld theory aspect (ii) of the unruh problem. it should
be emphasized that this aspect of the problem is of general interest for quantum eld theory. there are serious

arguments (see e.g. [1,313]) to think that the unruh eect is closely related to the eect of quantum evaporation
of black holes predicted by hawking [14]. it is claimed that both eects arise due to the presence of event horizons
and that schwarzschild observer in kruskal spacetime may be considered by analogy with rindler observer in ms.
furthermore very recently there were proposed some arguments that evaporation of an eternal schwarzschild black
hole may be considered as unruh eect in the six dimensional embedding ms [15,16].

the standard explanation of the unruh eect is based on existence of the aforementioned event horizons h
bordering the part of ms which is accessible for a rindler observer, the so-called r- wedge, see fig.1. in the context
of (ii) aspect of the unruh problem we refer the term rindler observer to a uniformly accelerated point object whose
trajectory is entirely located in the r-wedge so that the totality of world lines of all rindler observers completely
cover the interior of the r-wedge. 1

since such observer due to the presence of horizons have access only to a part of information possessed by inertial
observers it is commonly accepted that he sees the usual vacuum state in ms as a mixed state. to put this idea on
precise grounds unruh suggested [1] a new quantization scheme for a free eld in ms alternative to the standard one.
there are two sorts of particles in this scheme, namely r- particles living everywhere but in l- wedge and l-particles
living everywhere but in r- wedge. r-particles as seen by a rindler observer turn out to be nothing but the fulling
particles [17]. the corresponding modes carry only positive frequencies with respect to (t, z)- plain lorentz boost
generator. the parameter of lorentz boost may be chosen as time variable in the interior of the r-wedge and is called
rindler time. r- and l-particle content of minkowski vacuum in the unruh construction can be found by some formal
manipulations [1] and after elimination of non-visible for a rindler observer degrees of freedom corresponding to l-
particles the thermal density matrix with temperature (1.1) can be obtained, see e.g. refs. [5,1113].

such construction is however inconsistent because the unruh quantization is unitary inequivalent to the standard
one associated with minkowski vacuum. therefore the aforementioned expression for minkowski vacuum in terms
of r- and l- particles content doesnt make direct mathematical sense and the thermal density matrix which arises
after elimination of l- particles degrees of freedom actually vanishes. this diculty was pointed out in literature by
many authors (see e.g. refs. [7,18,13]).

therefore mathematically more rigorous methods based on algebraic approach to quantum eld theory were applied
to the problem. in the frame of this approach the notion of kubo-martin-schwinger (kms) state [19,20] is usually
used instead of thermal equilibrium state (which can not be rigorously dened in this problem). reformulation
of the unruh construction on the language of algebraic approach was presented in ref. [21].
it is worth to note
that mathematical physicists commonly identify [7,22,20] the unruh eect and the so-called bisogniano- wichmann
theorem [23,24]. this theorem is equivalent to the statement that the minkowski vacuum state (understood in
algebraic sense) when restricted to the wedge r of ms satises the kms condition with respect to rindler time and
the corresponding temperature parameter after evaluation in terms of the observer proper time is exactly the same
as given by eq.(1.1).

but apart from the diculties related to unitary inequivalence between the unruh and standard quantization
schemes there are also inconsistencies in physical interpretation of the unruh construction which (unlike mathematical
diculties) can not be resolved. indeed it is well known that before any measurement could be carried out one should
have prepared the initial state of the quantum system, the minkowski vacuum state in our case. however only a part
of ms consisting of the interior of the r-wedge is accessible for a rindler observer. we will refer to the interior of r- or
l- wedges as rindler spacetimes (rs). these spacetimes are separated from the rest of ms by the event horizons. as
a consequence any well dened scheme of quantization in rs should imply that the quantum eld satises boundary
condition at the edge h0 of rs. in fact this condition is nothing but the usual requirement of vanishing of the eld at
spatial innity.

certainly the horizons h arise due to excessive idealization of the problem. it is evident that in any physical
situation the only thing one can achieve is to accelerate the detector during arbitrary long but nite period of time.
in the latter case no horizons arise at all. but in this case one deals with the (i) aspect of the unruh problem which
has nothing to do with quantization of eld in rs and hence with the notion of fulling particles.

in virtue of boundary conditions the unruh quantization actually can be performed only in the so-called double
rindler wedge rather than in ms. the former is a disjoint union of the interiors of the wedges r and l separated
causally and in addition by a sort of topological obstacle . the role of the topological obstacle is played by the

1for deniteness we assume that rindler observers are moving in z- direction with respect to some inertial observer.

boundary condition necessary for the notion of fulling particles and absent in the real minkowski spacetime. it follows
then that rindler observers have nothing in common with the eld in ms and that minkowski vacuum can not be
prepared by any manipulations in double rs. moreover since the left and right rs are separated state vectors of
the eld in double rindler wedge are represented by tensor products of state vectors describing the elds from r-
and l- rindler spacetimes. since the elds in these spacetimes eternally dont have any inuence on each other only
such states are physically realizable which do not have any correlations between r and l particles. in other words
there is a superselection rule acting in the hilbert space of states representing quantum elds in the double rindler
wedge. let us stress that this sort of superselection rule arises due to eternal absence of interaction between the r
and l parts of the eld. therefore minkowski vacuum state which is formally represented in the unruh construction
[1] as a superposition of states with dierent number of r - particles and the same number of l - particles is
physically unrealizable for the quantum eld in the double rs and discussion of its thermal or other properties
becomes meaningless.

since the diculties with interpretation of the unruh construction are of physical nature they of course arise also
when one interprets the results obtained in algebraic approach. in ref. [21] the notion of kms state was related to
the usual notion of the bath of heated up r- and l- particles. but it occurs that these states may be mathematically
well-dened only for the observables which vanish at some neighborhood of the common edge of the right and left rs.
it is nothing but the mentioned above boundary condition which leads to loss of any connection between a rindler
observer and ms.

elucidation of the role of boundary conditions in the unruh problem is the central point of this paper. therefore
we begin in section ii with brief consideration of boundary conditions at spatial innity for a free eld quantized in a
plain-wave basis in ms. the existence of boundary conditions is always implied but their discussion is usually omitted
in text-books. nevertheless disregarding of this point may lead to mistakes in treating some delicate problems as
it happened in our opinion with the unruh problem. in section iii we consider boundary conditions for quantum
eld in rs. this case slightly diers in some technical details from the case of a free eld in ms due to the absence
of mass gap for fulling particles. section iv is devoted to consideration of quantization of a free eld in ms in
the basis of boost modes. this scheme of quantization is unitary equivalent to the usual plain wave quantization
and is exploited in the unruh construction. we consider the unruh construction in section v. we show that the
unruh quantization scheme is valid only for the double rindler wedge and can not be used for derivation of thermal
properties of minkowski vacuum with respect to a rindler observer. algebraic approach to the unruh problem is
discussed in section vi. our results are summarized in section vii.

in appendix a we present some technical details of derivation of the expression for boost mode annihilation operator
in terms of the eld values on a cauchy surface. the derived formula allows one to understand dierence between
the unruh and fulling operators. appendix b includes discussion of analogy between the unruh construction and
the construction of squeezed states for a two dimensional harmonic oscillator. in this appendix we have also included
a proof of unitary inequivalence of the standard plain wave and unruh schemes of quantization. although this issue
seems to be a well-known fact we actually could not nd a detailed discussion of it in physical literature.

in the paper we restrict our discussion to the case of massive neutral scalar eld in 1+1 dimensional ms. generaliza-
tion to higher dimensions may be obtained straightforwardly by introducing components of momentum ~q orthogonal

to the direction of motion of a rindler observer just changing denition of the mass of the eld as m  pm2 + q2

and inserting additional integration over ~q in appropriate places (see e.g. ref. [12] for 1 + 3 dimensional case and ref.
[10] for the general case of 1 + n dimensions).

short presentation of our results can be found in refs. [25,26].

ii. quantization of a neutral scalar field in d=1+1 minkowski spacetime (plane

wave modes)

in this section we will discuss the boundary conditions for a quantized free scalar eld in two-dimensional minkowski

space-time (ms). let

the plain waves

p(x) = (2p)1/2eiptp(z), p(z) = (2)1/2eipz,

form a complete set of solutions of the equation (2.2) orthonormalized relative to scalar product in ms

p =pp2 + m2,  < p < ,

(f, g)m  i

the completeness of the set (2.3) allows one to perform quantization by setting

m (x) =

p

p(x)(cid:3) ,

where ap and a
|0im in ms is dened by the relations

p are annihilation and creation operators obeying canonical commutation relations. the vacuum state

ap|0mi = 0,  < p < ,

(2.6)

and operators ap can be expressed in terms of eld operator m (x) values on an arbitrary spacelike surface by
ap = (p, m )m . in particular

ap = i



z

p(x) 



t

m (x) dz.

(2.7)

it is commonly assumed that the eld m (x) vanishes at spatial innity. nevertheless it is worth emphasizing that
the operators ap, a
p, m (x) are unbounded ones and therefore the requirement m (x)  0, z   as well as
relations (2.5),(2.7) should be understood in weak sense [2729]. the latter means that these statements relate to
arbitrary matrix elements of operators under discussion.

note that the requirement of vanishing of the eld m (x) in the weak sense at spatial innity is a necessary condition

for niteness of the energy of the eld. for illustration of this statement we will consider one particle amplitude

f (x) = h0m|m (x)|fi,

which determines all matrix elements of the free eld operator. one particle state |fi in eq.(2.8) is dened by

|fi = a(f )|0mi,

a(f ) =



z

dp f (p)a
p,

hf|fi =



z

dp |f (p)|2 = 1.

the eld hamiltonian expectation value in the state |fi is given by the following expression

(2.8)

and square integrability of f (x) and f (x)/z it is evident that the function f (t, z) is continuous and there exists
the limit
f (t, z). but if f (x) is square integrable then this limit should be zero (for details of the proof in

more general case see sec. 5.6 in ref. [30]). hence if we refuse from the condition (2.12) then the energy becomes
innite.

this boundary condition in terms of whightman functions is equivalent to vanishing of the two-point function for in-
nite spacelike separations. from eqs.(2.5), (2.6) for positive-frequency function (+)(x, m) = ih0m|m (x)m (0)|0mi

cauchy data of the function (x, m) on the surface t = 0 is

in full analogy with the cauchy data for the pauli-jordan function in four dimensional case [32,33].

iii. quantization of a neutral scalar field in d=1+1 rindler space

in this section we will consider quantization of a neutral scalar eld in d=1+1 rindler space the geometry of

which is described by the metric [34]

ds2 = 2d2  d2,  <  < +,

0 <  < .

(3.1)

this issue plays an important role for the unruh problem because it denes the notion of fulling particles. in the
sec.iii a we will dene the fulling modes which form a basis for quantization and introduce the notion of fulling
particles [17]. in the sec.iii b we will discuss boundary conditions arising in the procedure of fulling quantization.

case of the weyl limit-point. from mathematical point of view it results from the fact that deciency indices of
the operator kr are equal to (0, 0). the physical meaning of this condition was discussed by fulling [17] using the
language of wave packets.

we will discuss boundary conditions at both boundaries of rs, namely at the points  =  and  = 0. its
worth to note that the point  = 0 may also be considered as spatial innity. it becomes evident after the langer
transformation u = ln(m) ( < u < ) mapping the singular point  = 0 into . after this transformation
operator kr takes the form

kr = 

2
u2 + v (u),

v (u) = m2e2u.

since v (u) is a conning potential at u  + the boundary condition

g(, +) = 0,

(3.21)

(3.22)

is obvious and is satised not only for the amplitude (3.16) but even for eigenfunctions () of operator kr .
therefore we concentrate below on the less evident case  = 0 or u = .

 ((cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

z0

d
 |g|2 < .

(3.23)

(3.24)

(3.25)

(3.26)

but from these restrictions (unlike the case we had in ms) it does not immediately follow that

therefore we need use more delicate procedure to prove the condition (3.25).

let us split the integral in eq.(3.18) into three parts,

g(, 0) = 0.

g() = i1() + i2() + i3(),

1

2

i1 =

z0

g d,

i2 =

z1

g d,

i3 =



z2

g d,

where 1, 2 are arbitrary numbers such that 0 < 1  1  2 <  and the function g(, ) is dened in eq.(3.18).
after applying the known asymptotic behaviour of the macdonald function [31] we obtain for u = ln(m) < 0, |u|  1

8

g(, ) =

g()
 

  1,
 sin(u   ln 2),
cos(u   ln 2  arg (i)),
  1,
sin( ln   u + (ln 2  1) + /4),   1.

(3.27)




let us rst proceed with the last two terms in eq.(3.26). it follows from the normalization condition eq.(3.20)
and the evident inequality |g|  1
1 |g()| d/ should converge. therefore we may
apply the riemann-lebesgue lemma to conclude that i2() vanishes when   0. to estimate i3 we use the schwartz
inequality and get

2 (1 + |g|2) that the integral r 2

|i3()|2 

1
2



z2

|g()|2 d.

(3.28)

now using the condition of niteness of the energy eq.(3.23) we conclude that i3() may be done arbitrary small by
the appropriate (independent of the value of ) choice of 2. therefore the sum i2() + i3() tends to zero when
  0. note also that for dierentiable functions g() one has the estimation i2 + i3  ln1(1/m) for   m1.
consider now the rst part i1() of the integral in eq.(3.26). we will discuss rst the case of weight functions
g() which are continuous at the point  = 0. from eq.(3.20) it immediately follows that such weight functions
should vanish for   0, g(0) = 0.

let g() vanish for   0 as a power of ,

then from eqs.(3.26), (3.27) we obtain the estimation

g() = a,  > 0,   0.

i1() =

a() sin(/2)

(ln 2

m )

,

  m1,  6= 2, 4, 6, ...

.

(3.29)

(3.30)

thus for this case i1() decreases logarithmically when   0. we see that for 0 <  < 1 the term i1() dominates
in the sum in eq.(3.26) for small  and thus the whole integral over  is dened by the behaviour of g() at small 
while for  > 1 generally g() does not depend on behaviour of g() at small . for even values of  the leading
term (3.30) vanishes and i1() decreases for   0 even faster. for example, for the particular weight function

g0() =

a0( sinh )1/2

2()

|( + i)|2,

( > 0),

g0()  a02,   0,

(3.31)

(a0 - normalization constant) by performing kontorovich - lebedev transform [35,36] we obtain g() 
(m) exp(m)   for   m1.

if the weight function vanishes for small  logarithmically,

then for small  we have

i1() =

1

(cid:19)
m(cid:17) 


b
2(cid:16)ln ln 2

1 

c

m(cid:17) + ...

(cid:16)ln ln 2

g() = b(cid:18)ln

,

 > 0,   0,

(3.32)

(3.33)

,

where c = 0.577... is euler constant. this asymptotic representation is valid in particular for 0 <  < 1/2 when the
normalization integral (3.20) diverges. since the faster g() decreases for   0 the faster i1() tends to zero, we
conclude that the one particle amplitude g() tends to zero when   0 for all weight functions which are continuous
at  = 0, satisfy the normalization condition and correspond to the states with nite energy.

9

note that continuity of weight functions g() is not a necessary condition for the validity of the condition

eq.(3.25). as an example we will consider the weight function which for small  behaves as

g() = c  exp(d sin2 ),

  0,

 = ln(1/).

(3.34)

for big values of  this function is localized almost near the points n = n with characteristic width n =
d1/2(n)/2. therefore for the contribution of small  to the normalization integral eq.(3.20) we have

1

z0

d
 |g()|2 =



z1

d |g(e)|2 xn

d1/2(n)2/2,

(3.35)

where 1 = ln( 1
1
if

). therefore the function g() with behaviour at small  as given by eq.(3.34) may be normalizable

 > 4 + 2

(3.36)

0

|g()| d/ =r 

(the case  = 1/2,  = 6 is known as dirichlet-reymond example [37,30]). but let us note that for the function
eq.(3.34) with parameters satisfying eq.(3.36) the integral r 1
1 |g(e)| d also converges and thus
in virtue of the riemann-lebesgue lemma we conclude that even in this case we have i1()  0 as   0. it looks as
if the condition eq.(3.25) is valid for discontinues at  = 0 weight functions as well.
let us also note that for arbitrary small but nite accuracy of measuring of energy of fulling particles the
weight functions of the type eq.(3.34) are physically indistinguishable from those vanishing for small . we can state
therefore that the boundary condition eq.(3.25) is satised at least for all physically realizable states |gi.
it is worth to emphasize that the considered boundary condition (3.25) for quantized eld can not be reduced to
the boundary condition (0) = 0 for functions from the domain of denition of the operator kr because the expansion
(3.9) is valid for nonvanishing (in weak sense) at the point  = 0 functions r() as well. the situation is the same
as in the plain-wave quantization scheme in ms where the boundary condition (2.12) does not necessarily follow from
the self-adjointness of the operator km (z).

if one deals with the states |gi for which
z0

hg|k 1|gi =



d
2 |g()|2 = 2



z0

d
 |g()|2 < ,

(3.37)

then the boundary condition eq.(3.25) may be proved straightforwardly in the same way as it was done in section ii.
the condition eq.(3.37) corresponds to the regularity condition which was proposed by kay in ref. [21] to guarantee
the existence of thermal states for fulling quantization system.

at the end of the section let us discuss the asymptotic behaviour of whightman function d(+)(  , , ) for
xed value of  and   0. in this case the two-point commutator vanishes and the contribution of small  to the
integral in eq.(3.13b) becomes principal. thus we have

d(+)(  , , ) =

ik0(m)
 ln(2/m)

+ o(ln2(1/m)),

(s2 < 0).

(3.38)

we see that physically signicant quantities die out at point  = 0 in rs as they do at spatial innity in ms.

iv. quantization of a neutral scalar field in d=1+1 minkowski spacetime (boost

modes)

the rindler observer world line coincides with one of the orbits of lorentz group and r-wedge is one of domains
of ms invariant under lorentz rotation. therefore it is convenient dealing with the unruh problem to quantize the
eld in the basis of eigenfunctions of lorentz boost operator rather than in the plane-wave basis.

since the secondary quantized boost operator l = mtx does not commute with the energy h and momentum p

operators,

10

[l, h] = ip,

[l, p ] = ih,

(4.1)

in order to
it is not diagonal in terms of annihilation, creation operators of particles with given momentum p.
diagonalize the operator l we replace rst the variable p by the rapidity q = artanh (p/p) and introduce new
operators q as

the energy, momentum and boost operators are expressed in terms of new operators as follows

q = (m cosh q)1/2ap,

[q, 

q ] = (q  q).

h = m



z

dq cosh q

qq, p = m



z

dq sinh q

qq, l =

i
2



z

dq 
q


q

q.

it is easy to see that in terms of operators b which are fourier transforms of operators q

b =

1
2



z

eiqq dq, q =

1
2



z

eiqb d.

the boost operator l is diagonal

l =



z

 b

b d.

using the denition (4.2) and the relations (4.4) one can easily transform the eq.(2.5) to the form

m (x) =



z

d{b(x) + b



(x)},

where functions  are dened by the integral representation [38,39,25,26]

(x) =

1

23/2



z

dq exp{im(z sinh q  t cosh q)  iq}.

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

it is assumed that an innitely small negative imaginary part added to t, see appendix a. it may be shown that
functions (4.7) are eigenfunctions of the boost generator b,

b(x) = (x),  <  < +, b = i(z/t + t/z).

(4.8)

they are orthonormal relative to inner product in ms,

and together with their adjoints 
functions boost modes.

(, )m = (  ),
 form a complete set of solutions for kfg equation in ms. we will call this set of

, )m = 0,

(4.9)

(

the boost modes can serve as a basis for a new quantization scheme for the eld m (x). indeed according to

eqs.(4.2), (4.4) the commutation relations for b read

[b, b

] = (  ),

[b, b] = [b

, b

] = 0.

the vacuum state with respect to operators b which obeys the condition

b|0mi = 0.

11

(4.10)

(4.11)

is exactly the usual minkowski vacuum. this is because the transition from the operators q to b (4.4) is a unitary
transformation,

b = f f , f f  = f f = 1, f = exp
i

z

dq (cid:8)q

qq(cid:9)
 ,

qqq + (q2  1)

(4.12)

and hence the solutions  correspond to positive frequencies relative to global time t. note that quantization of
scalar eld dened by eqs.(4.10), (4.11), (4.6) is equivalent to the one performed in ref. [40] by analytical extension
of green functions.

there exists another representation of boost modes [25,26] (see also ref. [8] for the fermion case) corresponding

to splitting of ms into the right (r), future (f), left (l) and past (p) wedges, see fig.1,

 = (x+)(x)(r)

 + (x+)(x)(f )

 + (x+)(x)(l)

 + (x+)(x)(p )
 ,

(4.13)

where x = t x are null coordinates in ms. by performing integration in eq.(4.7) under assumption x+ > 0, x < 0
and using integral representation for macdonald functions [31] we obtain for (r)



(r)

 =

1

exp(cid:18) 

2  i


2

ln(cid:18) x+

x(cid:19)(cid:19) ki(cid:0)mpxx+(cid:1) .

the explicit form for the boost modes in other wedges may be obtained from (4.14a) by analytical extension. the
branch points of the function eq.(4.14a) lie on the light cone and for transition from one wedge to another one should
use the substitutions (x)  xei for the transition r  f , x+  (x+)ei for f  l, x  (x)ei for
l  p and (x+)  x+ei for p  r. thus we obtain

(4.14a)

(4.14b)

x (cid:19)(cid:19) ki(cid:0)mpxx+(cid:1) .
i (cid:16)mp(x)(x+)(cid:17) .

after transition p  r we return to eq.(4.14a). the second linearly independent set of solutions for kfg equation

 may be obtained from eqs.(4.14a) - (4.14d) by substitutions x  xei. the possibility of unique recovery
of the values of (x) (and hence the values of the eld m (x)) in the full ms using its values only in r-wedge and
the requirement of positivity of the energy is an illustration of the content of the reeh-schlieder theorem (see e.g.
refs. [41,42]).

the splitting (4.13) corresponds to the four families of orbits of the two-dimensional lorentz group (compare to
6 of chapter v in ref. [43]). as it was already mentioned the functions eqs.(4.14a) - (4.14d) have branch points at
the light cone which corresponds to the four degenerate orbits x = 0, sgnt = 1. for example if t  z > 0 then
using the expansion of macdonald function k() for   0 [31] we obtain
+ (i)(cid:16)

e/2(cid:26)(i)(cid:16) mx+

2 (cid:17)i

the light cone asymptotic behaviour of the other functions eqs.(4.14b) - (4.14d) may be derived from eq.(4.15a) by
the described above procedure of analytical extension. for example,

(f )

 =

1

23/2

e/2(cid:26)(i)(cid:16) mx+

2 (cid:17)i

2 (cid:17)i
+ e(i)(cid:16) mx

+ ...(cid:27) .

(4.15b)

12

after substituting these expressions in eq.(4.13) we nd the light-cone behaviour of the boost mode which reads

(x) =

1

23/2

e/2(cid:26)(i)(cid:16) mx+

2  i0(cid:17)i

+ (i)(cid:16)

mx

2

+ i0(cid:17)i

+ ...(cid:27) .

(4.16)

the distributions (  i0) = () + ei()() in eq.(4.16) were dened and studied in ref. [44]. it is clear
from eq.(4.16) that in spite of the presence of -functions in eq.(4.13) the modes (x) obey the kfg equation
without sources. in the vertex of the light cone t = z = 0 (which is the xed point for the lorentz group) from
eq.(4.7) we get

(0, 0) =

1
2

().

the same result may be derived either from eqs.(4.14a) - (4.14d) by taking into account that [45]

i
2

h (1)
i (0) = 

i
2

h (2)

i (0) =

1


ki(0) = (),

(4.17)

(4.18)

or from eq.(4.16). this result means that all modes (x) except for the singular zero mode vanish at the vertex of
the light cone.

the expression for the annihilation operator b in terms of eld operator on an arbitrary cauchy surface (compare

eqs.(2.7),(3.11)) read

b = (, m )m = i



z

(t, z) 



t

m (t, z) dz,

t 6= 0.

for the surface t = 0 we have [25]

b =

(4.19)

(4.20)

with upper (lower) signs corresponding to the indices r (l) consequently. (the derivation of this very important
formula is given in appendix a).

note that calculation of the whightman function (+)(x, m) by use of eqs.(4.6), (4.11) of course leads to the
result (2.13). it gives the independent proof that the plain waves quantization is unitary equivalent to the boost
modes one.

v. the unruh construction

in this section we will consider the quantum eld theory aspect of the unruh problem. the study of this problem
was inspired by fulling who suggested [17] in 1973 a valid scheme for quantization of a massive scalar eld in rs (see
sec.iii). fulling treated rs as a part of ms and hence considered fulling-rindler vacuum as a state of quantum eld
in ms. therefore he tried to express the annihilation and creation operators of fulling-rindler particles (3.11) in terms
of plain-wave operators (2.7) and argued that the minkowski vacuum state could be interpreted as a many-particle
fulling-rindler state. in virtue of the boundary conditions which the eld r must obey in rs and which we have
considered in sec.iii fulling procedure in ms is physically meaningless. but even if one disregards the existence of
boundary conditions the quantization scheme suggested by fulling is incorrect for ms since it implied the assumption
that the eld modes which he used for quantization were equal to zero outside r-wedge of ms. in other words only
the rst term from eq.(4.13) for boost modes was involved in the procedure of quantization. but due to the presence

13

of -functions this term obeys not the kfg equation for the free eld in ms but the equation with sources of innite
power localized on the light cone.

to avoid this diculty unruh with the help of a rather elegant trick made an attempt to construct a new scheme of
quantization which should be valid in ms and in some sense repeat the fulling scheme in r-wedge. the central point
of unruh suggestion [1] was to use such superpositions r, l of boost modes  with positive and 
 with negative
frequencies that they vanish either in the left or right wedges of ms and coincide with fulling modes respectively in
the right or left wedges. we will present the explicit form of the unruh modes and discuss the unruh quantization
scheme in sec.v a. then in the sec.v b we will discuss the so-called unruh eect.

the unruh modes can be expressed in terms of boost modes as follows

a. the unruh quantization

r(x) =

1

2 sinh ne/2(x)  e/2

(x)o , l(x) =

where  > 0. these functions obey the normalization conditions

1

2 sinh ne/2

(x)  e/2(x)o , (5.1)

(r, r )m = (l, l)m = (  ),

(r, r

 )m = (l, l

 )m = (r, l )m = (r, l

)m = 0.

(5.2)

with the help of eqs.(4.14a) - (4.14d) one can easily check that for x belonging to the right wedge r the left unruh
modes l(x) vanish while the right modes r(x) coincide with fulling modes (), eq.(3.7). for the light cone
behaviour of unruh modes in the right wedge r we have

r(x) = () 

sinh

(cid:26)(i)(cid:16) mx+

2 (cid:17)i(cid:27) ,

x  r,

x  0.

(5.3)

in the future wedge f they can be represented as

x(cid:19)i/2
x(cid:19)i/2

ji(cid:0)mx+x(cid:1) 
ji(cid:0)mx+x(cid:1)

r(x) = 

i

2sinh  (cid:18) x+

l(x) =

i

2sinh  (cid:18) x+

note that in spite of unruh statement made in ref. [1] functions (5.1) can not be obtained by analytical extension
of fulling modes (3.7) through the future and past horizons into the f - and p -wedges. as a matter of fact the unruh
modes are combinations of functions dened on dierent sheets of riemannian surface, see the rules for enclosing of
brunch points of the boost modes in sec.iv.

by inverting the relations eq.(5.1) and substituting the result in eq.(4.6) one obtains

m (x) =



z0

d{rr(x) + r

r

(x) + ll

(x) + l

l(x)}.

(5.5)

the eq.(5.5) holds everywhere in ms except the origin of minkowski coordinate frame because the boost mode (x)
is singular at the point x = (0, 0) (see eq.(4.17)) and hence it is impossible to perform integration in eq.(4.6) at this
point over positive and negative values of  independently. this means that expansion (5.5) is valid for the eld in
ms with cut out point x = (0, 0) 3.

3this fact was earlier proposed as the reason for thermal properties of minkowski vacuum in refs. [46,47].

14

the unruh operators r and l from eq.(5.5) are dened by the expressions [1,48]

r =

1

2 sinh ne/2b + e/2b

o ,

l =

1

2 sinh ne/2b + e/2b
o ,

( > 0).

(5.6)

using eqs.(4.10) one can easily show that these operators obey the following commutation relations

[r, r

 ] = [l, l

 ] = (  ),

[r, r ] = [l, l ] = [r, l] = [r, l

 ] = 0.

(5.7)

though the unruh operators satisfy canonical commutation relations (5.7) it is not enough they could be con-
sidered as annihilation, creation operators. a necessary condition for the latter is existence of a stationary ground
state for the system, vacuum state. neither the unruh modes (5.1) nor their adjoints are positive frequency solutions
for kfg equation in p - and f -wedges with respect to any timelike variable and hence the unruh operators (5.6) are
composed of creation and annihilation operators which relate to particles with opposite sign of frequency. therefore
it is clear that in the global ms a stationary vacuum state with respect to the r- and l-particles can not exist.

to conrm this point let us see how the rst term in parentheses in eq.(5.5) behave in f -wedge at small  (see

eqs.(4.14a), (5.1), (5.6))

rr(x)  

i

23/2

j0(cid:0)mx+x(cid:1) (b0 + b

0) 

1


,   0,

x  f.

(5.8)

it is clear that the contribution of this term to the integral (5.5) diverges logarithmically at the lower limit. similarly
we have

l
l(x) 

i

23/2

j0(cid:0)mx+x(cid:1) (b0 + b

0) 

1


,   0,

x  f.

(5.9)

though singularities cancel in the sum of these two terms in eq.(5.5) it is clear that none of the matrix elements of
these parts of the eld operator m (x) exist separately. the same is true for contributions of terms with all other
unruh operators. this situation certainly holds also for the p -wedge.

this consideration shows that the unruh operators (5.6) may not be interpreted as annihilation, creation operators

and the unruh construction may not be regarded as a valid quantization scheme in the global ms.

nevertheless we may consider the integral (5.5) only for the world points located entirely in r- and l-wedges
i.e. inside the double rindler wedge. it is important that being restricted to the double rindler wedge the l.h.s. of
eq.(5.5) cannot be considered as the eld m (x) in ms. indeed taking into account that the unruh (eq. (5.1)) and
fulling (eq.(3.7)) modes coincide in the r-wedge we may represent the l.h.s. of eq.(5.5) there in the form

m (x) = lim
0



z

d{r(x) + r



(x)},

x  r.

(5.10)

then considering for the sake of simplicity the case of equal times t = t = 0 we have

h0m| m (0, z) m (0, z)|0mi =

1
2 lim

0



z

d cosh ki(mz)ki(mz),

z, z > 0.

(5.11)

since (1/2)ki(0) = 0 at  > 0 (see eq.(4.18)) we obtain for z = 0

at the same time for the whightman function in ms we have

h0m| m (0, z) m (0, 0)|0mi = 0.

(5.12)

h0m|m (0, z)m (0, 0)|0mi =

1
22



z

d cosh ki(mz)ki(0) =

1
2

k0(mz),

z > 0,

(5.13)

15

in full agreement with eq.(2.13). it is clear after comparison of eqs.(5.12),(5.13) that +(x, m) is not equal to zero
in the r-wedge only due to existence of singular zero boost mode (4.17). since this mode is absent in the unruh set
(5.1) the latter is not a complete set of solutions for the kfg equation. therefore from this moment we will denote
the l.h.s. of eq.(5.5) as dw (x) instead of m (x).

consider quantization of the eld dw (x) in the double rindler wedge now. since there exists a timelike variable,
namely rindler time, with respect to which the unruh modes (5.1) are positive frequency solutions of kfg equation
we can attach to the unruh operators the meaning of annihilation, creation operators of particles living in the double
rindler wedge. but the elds in r- and l-wedges are absolutely independent of each other since any two points
belonging to dierent wedges are separated by spacelike interval. therefore double rindler wedge is a disjoint union
of r- and l-wedges and quantization in these wedges should be carried out separately. we have discussed already
quantization procedure in the r-wedge and found that it implies existence of boundary condition ensuring niteness of
the eld energy. it is clear that the eld in double rindler wedge dw (x) should satisfy the same boundary condition.
taking into account these considerations we should rewrite eq.(5.5) in the form

dw (x) =



z0

d{rr(x) + r

r

(x)} +



z0

d{ll

(x) + l

l(x)},

x  r  l,

(5.14)

where unruh operators should coincide with the corresponding fulling operators c, c
in r- and l-wedges respectfully if the eld dw (x) satises the boundary condition

 and c

, c


 for particles living

dw (0, 0) = 0.

(5.15)

we will prove the latter statement for the operator r as an example.

substituting the expression (4.19) for operators b, b

 into the rst formula in eq.(5.6) we obtain after transition

to rindler coordinates (3.14)

r = lim
0

(c()  c(s)

 ()),

c() =

i
2



z

d


()(cid:18) m

  im(cid:19)=0

,

c(s)
 () =

isinh

m (0, )(cid:26)(i)(cid:16) m
2 (cid:17)i

 (i)(cid:16) m

2 (cid:17)i(cid:27) ,

(5.16a)

(5.16b)

(5.16c)

note that both c() and c(s)
 () become singular for   0 if m (0, 0) 6= 0 but the singularities cancel in their
dierence in eq.(5.16a). it is clear from eqs.(5.16a), (5.16c) that although eqs.(5.16b), (3.11) look similar, one can
not identify the right unruh operator r and the fulling annihilation operator c unless

this condition should be understood in weak sense of course.

from eqs.(4.6), (4.17) we however formally have

m (0, 0) = 0.

m (0, 0) =

b0 + b
02

=



z

(ap + a

p),

dp

p4p

and therefore for the value of one-particle amplitude (2.8) at the vertex of the light cone we obtain

f (0, 0) =

f (p).



z

dp

p4p

(5.17)

(5.18)

(5.19)

of course there are no any physical reasons to require vanishing of this quantity in ms. thus if one understands
eq.(5.17) as a condition for the eld in ms it means nothing but cutting out the point t = z = 0. cutting out
even a single point is not however a painless operation for ms because it dramatically changes its properties. in
particular ms looses its property to be a globally hyperbolic spacetime. as a consequence the cauchy data (2.16)
for the two-point commutator corresponds now to zero solution of kfg equation unlike what we have in real ms.
since in four-dimensional ms the pauli-jordan function has cauchy data similar to (2.16) this result is not a specic
property of two dimensional case.

this inconsistency disappears if we apply the unruh construction to the double rindler wedge rather than
to ms. that means that we should use the expansion (5.14) instead of (5.5), substitute dw instead of m in
eqs.(5.16b),(5.16c) and read eq.(5.17) as eq.(5.15). as a result we conclude that the unruh construction is a valid
quantization scheme only in the double rindler wedge.

b. the unruh eect

there are several ways to give proof of existence of the unruh eect in the frames of conventional quantum

eld theory [1,5,6,8,1013].

one of them is based on the equation

h0m|r

r|0mi =(cid:0)e2  1(cid:1)1

(  ),

(5.20)

which can be easily obtained using eqs.(5.6), (4.11). the l.h.s. of the eq.(5.20) at  =  is interpreted after
integration over  as minkowski vacuum expectation value of the operator of fulling particles, while the r.h.s. of this
equation after the standard trick is written as

(  )|= =



z

ei()|=

d
2

=

g
2

,

where  = /g is proper time and g is proper acceleration of rindler observer. then eq.(5.20) is transformed to the
form

 n


=



z0

d
2

(e2/g  1)1,

(5.21)

where  = g is commonly understood as the energy of fulling quanta. finally the integrand in eq.(5.21) is identied
with the thermal spectrum corresponding to davies-unruh temperature (1.1).

however, as it was shown in the previous section, one can not identify unruh operators r, r

 with fulling
annihilation and creation operators c, c
 can not serve as annihilation and
creation operators of any particles in ms. therefore the l.h.s. of eq.(5.20) can not be interpreted as minkowski
vacuum expectation value of number of particles.

 in ms. moreover operators r, r

the unruh operators coincide with the corresponding fulling operators for the eld obeying the boundary
condition (5.15) in the double rindler wedge. but an observer living in rs can not dene minkowski vacuum state.
to conclude that the state of the eld is minkowski vacuum one must have possibilities to perform measurements in
every point of cauchy surface in the whole ms. this is impossible for an observer living in r- (or l-) wedge because
he can not perform measurements at the points belonging to l- (or r-) wedge. from mathematical point of view this
statement is a direct consequence of reeh-schlieder theorem, see refs. [41,42]. on the other hand observers living
in the double rindler wedge are not able to perform such measurements due to existence of the boundary condition
(5.15).

let us also note that the bose factor in the r.h.s. of eq.(5.20) should not be necessarily interpreted as ther-
mal distribution. this factor appears entirely due to specic properties of bogolubov transformation (5.6) and is
encountered in many physical problems where in no way does the notion of temperature arise. two-mode squeezed
photon states in quantum optics [49,50] is a well known example of such situation, see also ref. [51]. two-dimensional
harmonic oscillator can serve as another example, see appendix b.

17

another derivation of the unruh eect is based on the relation [1,13]

|0mi = z  1

2



z0



xn=0

d1 . . .

dn e



i

n

pi=1



z0

|11 , . . . 1nil  |11, . . . 1nir.

(5.22)

this formula determines r- and l-particle content of minkowski vacuum and allows one to introduce the density
matrix describing states of the eld in r-wedge, see e.g. [5,7,1013]. the latter is achieved by taking the tensor
product of the r.h.s. of eq.(5.22) with its dual and then taking trace over the states of the eld in the l-wedge. so
for an arbitrary observable r depending on the values of the eld m (x) for x belonging only to the right rindler
wedge r we have

h0m|r|0mi = sp (rr),

r = z 1 exp(hr/tdu ).

(5.23)

in this equation r is the density matrix and hr = gk = gr 

respect to proper time  of the accelerating observer.

0 c

c d is a secondly quantized hamiltonian with

however the l.h.s. of eq.(5.22) may not be considered as minkowski vacuum state because as we have shown in
the previous section the notion of rindler particles which is essentially used in derivation of eq.(5.22) makes sense only
in double rindler wedge rather than in global ms. therefore eq.(5.22) could describe vacuum state only in double
rindler wedge. but it loses any physical meaning if one takes into account the existence of boundary condition (5.15).
indeed the derivation of eq.(5.22) assumes (see e.g. [13]) that one-particle hilbert space in the double rindler wedge is
a direct sum of one-particle hilbert spaces in r- and l-wedges hdw = hr hl and fock space of states of the eld
in double rindler wedge f (hdw ) is a tensor product of fock spaces on hr and hl, f (hdw ) = f (hr)  f(hl).
but in virtue of boundary condition, which is equivalent to cutting out the vertex of light cone, r- and l-wedges have
no common points and therefore never interact. therefore only such superpositions of state vectors from f (hdw ) can
have physical sense which do not contain correlations between r- and l-particles. this superselection rule prohibits
states of the type eq.(5.22).

besides the normalization constant z in eq.(5.22) which also has the meaning of partition function in eq.(5.23)

is innite, namely

z = exp((0)2/12),

(5.24)

see appendix b. the divergence of constant z means that representations of the canonical commutation relations in
terms of unruh and boost modes operators are unitary inequivalent.

there could exist two ways to formulate eq.(5.23) in mathematically meaningful way and avoid these diculties.
the rst one is to place the eld in a box which in this problem could be constructed by two uniformly accelerated
mirrors moving in right and left rindler wedges [52]. however such regularization again leads to consideration of
double rs as a physical spacetime of the observer. the second opportunity is to use algebraic approach and a notion
of kms state as a denition of thermal equilibrium state. we discuss below the formulation of eq.(5.23) which was
developed in the frame of algebraic approach to quantum eld theory.

vi. algebraic approach

algebraic approach to quantum theory [53,18,20,13] allows one to compare states which cannot be represented
by vectors or density matrices in the same hilbert space representation of algebra of observables of the system. it is
because the states in this approach are primarily considered as positive normalized linear functionals over the algebra
of observables rather than vectors in hilbert space. the physical meaning of the state  in algebraic approach is
that the value (a) is the expectation value of the observable a in the state . the algebraic counterpart of usual
thermal equilibrium state is called the kms state [19,22,20]. unlike usual thermal equilibrium state the kms state
exists even if partition function of the system diverges. on the language of algebraic approach the unruh eect means
that the algebraic state corresponding to minkowski vacuum state coincides with the kms state for double fulling
quantization. in this section we will show that such conclusion implies existence of boundary condition at the origin
of minkowski reference frame. our consideration will make clear that in algebraic derivation of the unruh eect the
same inconsistencies are present as in traditional approach.

18

a. one mode model

in order to use simple and suitable notation, let us rst present the construction of kms state over the one mode
quantum system (i.e. one-dimensional harmonic oscillator). we will see that the case of free bose eld in d = 1 + 1
ms requires just a trivial generalization.

let r be one-mode quantum system. its algebra of observables (which we denote by ur) may be characterized
either in terms of unbounded generators, annihilation and creation operators r, r satisfying commutation relation

or in terms of weyl generators

[r, r] = 1,

w (f ) = exp(f r  f r),

labeled by complex number f 4 and which satisfy the following requirements

w (f1)w (f2) = exp( 1

2 (f 

1 f2  f 

2 f1))w (f1 + f2), w (f ) = w (f ).

(6.1)

(6.2)

(6.3)

an arbitrary observable r may be written in the form r = r(r, r). time evolution of observables is determined by
the equation

with hr = rr being the one-mode hamiltonian. in particular,

r(t) = u (t)ru (t), u (t) = exp(ihrt),

r(t) = r(reit, reit), w (f, t) = w (f (t)),

f (t) = f eit.

(6.4)

(6.5)

vacuum state r is dened by the relation r|0ri = 0 and the hilbert space hr where the considered operators act
is generated by the basis |nri = (r)n/n!|0ri. the algebraic vacuum state r is a prescription for calculating
expectation values in the vacuum state

r(r) = h0r|r(r, r)|0ri.

the vacuum expectation value of weyl generator w (f ) may be easily shown to be equal to

thermal equilibrium state with inverse temperature  is dened as follows

r(w (f )) = exp( 1

2|f|2).

()
r (r) = sp (r),

 = z 1

 exp(hr) = z 1

 xn

exp(n)|nrihnr|,

(6.6)

(6.7)

(6.8)

where z =pn

exp(n). of course z is nite for this simple one-mode model, z = (1  e)1. but since this
may be not the case for quantum systems with innite number of degrees of freedom it is important to reformulate
eq.(6.8) in the form not containing the value of z explicitly.

in order to do it one should introduce another copy of system r, say l which does not interact with r, and
consider the combined quantum system r  l , the double system. 5 the asterisk here indicates that we choose
hamiltonian of the combined system to be

4the unbounded operators r, r may be expressed in terms of weyl generators, for example r = 1
where derivatives are taken with respect to f .
5normally in applications of kms states to statistical mechanics this additional copy of initial system is considered as a
mathematical trick used with the purpose to describe thermal state by a vector in hilbert space and there are no attempts to
interpret it as a really existent.

2 (w (f )  iw (if ))|f =0

19

rather than hr  1 + 1  hl (compare to eq.(b1)). one can interpret it saying that time direction at l is inverted.
the vacuum state of the system r  l is dened by the relations

hrl = hr  1  1  hl

(6.9)

where l is annihilation operator for l and the vectors

r|0rli = 0,

l|0rli = 0,

(l)m
m! |0rli,
constitute the basis of the hilbert space hrl . let us introduce the state
exp(n/2)|nri  |nli.

|i = z 1/2

|nri  |mli =

(r)n
n!

 xn

it can be immediately veried that the thermal expectation value (6.8) may be rewritten in the form

()
r (r) = h|r(r  1, r  1)|i,

(6.10)

(6.11)

where calculation is performed in the space hrl . note that the expectation value (6.11) does not depend on time.
this property served as a reason for the choice of hamiltonian hrl in the form (6.9).

now let us consider operators

b+ = cosh  r  1  sinh  1  l,

b =  sinh  r  1 + cosh  1  l,

(6.12)

where  is dened by the equation tanh  = e/2. note that these operators depend on time as b(t)  eit.
the key observation is that these operators annihilate the state |i and together with b
 satisfy the usual
commutation relations

+, b

b|i = 0,

[b+, b] = 0,

[b+, b

] = 0,

[b, b

] = 1.

(6.13)

the span of the vectors of the form

constitutes the hilbert space h which in our one-mode case coincides with the space hrl . expressing operators
r, r in terms of operators b we can rewrite eq.(6.11) in the form

(b
+)n
n!

(b
)m
m!

|i

()
r (r) = h|r(b+ cosh  + b

 sinh , b sinh  + b

+ cosh )|i.

(6.14)

the r.h.s. of this equation does not contain z and in virtue of eqs.(6.13) is just the vacuum expectation value of the
observable r but calculated in the space h and with respect to vacuum |i. in general the algebraic state dened
by eq.(6.14) is called the kms state. 6
in our case the kms state (6.14) is just the usual thermal equilibrium state. one can generalize the denition

of kms state to the observables of the double system r  l which have the form a(r, r, l, l) by setting
()(a) = h|a(b+ cosh  + b

+ cosh , b cosh  + b

 sinh , b sinh  + b

+ sinh , b

 cosh  + b+ sinh )|i. (6.15)

6another equivalent denition of kms state is given by the requirement ()
r1, r2 are arbitrary observables of system r, [54,55,19,56].

r (r1(t)r2(t)) = ()

r (r2(t)r1(t + i)) where

20

the state dened by eq.(6.15) is called the double kms state [21]. given denitions of kms and double kms states
in the evident way may be generalized to the case of any nite or innite number of degrees of freedom. for the latter
case the usual denition of thermal equilibrium state is in general not valid.

let us give the formulas for expectation values of weyl generators in kms and double kms states. by simple

computation one gets

()

r (w (f )) = exp(cid:18)

1
2

coth(cid:18) 

2 (cid:19)|f|2(cid:19) .

we dene the weyl generator w (fr, fl) for the double system by the equation

w (fr, fl) = exp(frr  f 

rr  f 

ll + fll).

(6.16)

(6.17)

the advantage of this denition is that time dependence of weyl generator takes the form w (fr, fl, t) =
w (freit, fleit) or in other words both fr and fl are positive frequency solutions for one-mode wave equation
t + 2)f = 0. the expectation value of the operator (6.17) in the double kms state may be shown to be equal to
(2

()(w (fr, fl)) = exp(cid:26)

1
2

sinh(/2)

rfl(cid:27) .

(6.18)

b. the unruh problem in algebraic approach

now let us turn back to the unruh problem. at rst sight eqs.(6.12) and the denition of the state |i (6.13)
look very similar to inverted eqs.(5.6) expressing boost operators b in terms of unruh operators r, l and the
denition of the state |mi in eq.(4.11). but we will show that it is not correct to apply the notion of double kms
state to the unruh problem. the physical reason is that free eld in minkowski spacetime cannot be decomposed into
two non-interacting elds living in the interior of right and left rindler wedges.

to reformulate the eq.(5.23) in terms of algebraic approach let us introduce the required denitions. the algebra
u of observables of the free eld in ms is a c algebra with weyl generators w () = exp{(m , )m} where m (x)
is the quantum eld operator and (x) is a real-valued solution of kfg equation (2.2). more precisely u contains
arbitrary nite linear combinations of weyl generators and their limits in the sense of convergence in c norm. for a
complete set of positive frequency orthonormal modes (x) we dene f by the equation f = (, )m and rewrite
w () in the form

where a is the appropriate annihilation operator. the weyl relations take form

w () = exp(cid:26)z d (fa  f 

a

)(cid:27) ,

w (1)w (2) = exp(cid:26) 1

finite linear combinations of elements from u of the form w () with  vanishing in the closed wedge l and
limits in the sense of convergence in c
the limits of sequences of such linear combinations in uniform sense (i.e.
norm) constitute a c subalgebra ur of u which is called the right wedge algebra. the left wedge algebra ul and
the double wedge algebra u are dened similarly by restricting to solutions which vanish in closed wedge r and in a
neighborhood of h0 respectively, see fig.1.

one concludes after comparing eqs.(6.22),(6.23) that equation

on u.

(6.28)

(6.29)

(6.30)

(6.31)

this equation is an analog of eq.(5.23) in algebraic approach (see ref. [21]). the restriction of eq.(6.31) to the right
wedge algebra ur is usually referred as bisogniano - wichmann theorem [23,24,21,20].
we see that eq.(6.31) holds only on the double wedge subalgebra u  u, which corresponds to the space of those
solutions for the eld equation which satisfy the boundary condition (6.30). the r.h.s. of eq.(6.31) doesnt admit
continuation to the whole algebra u while the l.h.s. admits such continuation. therefore functionals m and (2)
let us consider two opportunities to interpret eq.(6.31). the rst one is to treat u as the true algebra of observ-
ables for the accelerated observer. in this case eq.(6.31) does not hold for all observables and therefore minkowski
vacuum does not coincide with the thermal state (2)

describe dierent algebraic states over the algebra of observables of the free eld in ms.

f

.

f

the second opportunity is to propose that u should be the true algebra of observables for accelerated observer.
in this case the true minkowski vacuum state m (which is the state over the algebra u) is unrealizable state for such
observer. then eq.(6.31) is satised for all physical observables and hence the restriction m| u of the state m to u
coincides with the state (2)
and admits interpretation in terms of fulling  unruh quanta. but let us stress that
the minkowski vacuum state is physically distinguished among the other possible states of the theory not so much
due to its explicit expression (which of course is inherited by its restrictions to the subalgebras of u) as by its key
physical properties such as poincare invariance, spectral conditions, local commutativity and cluster property (see
the whightman reconstruction theorem, [42]). although some of these properties are inherited by the restrictions to
subalgebras, the other properties such as poincare invariance generally are not 9. but exactly these properties are
mentioned when one assumes that some quantum system is prepared initially in the state of minkowski vacuum. since
subalgebra u is not poincare invariant there are no any physical reasons to consider the state m| u as the initial state
of the eld. moreover, since the automorphisms of u corresponding to boost time evolution dont mix up observables
from ur and ul there is still no way for rindler observer to prepare the state m| u . we see that consideration of
unruh problem in algebraic approach leads to the same results as in usual eld-theoretical approach.

f

we have analyzed the unruh problem in the frame of quantum eld theory and have shown that the unruh
quantization scheme is valid in the double rindler wedge rather than in ms. the double rindler wedge is composed

vii. conclusions

8compare to eqs.(5.16a)-(5.16c), see also appendix a.
9lacking of poincare invariance for eld theory with boost time evolution is a consequence of the fact that 1-parameter boost
group does not constitute normal subgroup in poincare group.

23

of two disjoint regions which causally do not communicate with each other. moreover the unruh construction implies
existence of boundary condition at the point h0 (or 2-dimensional plain in the case of 1 + 3-dimensional spacetime)
of ms. such boundary condition may be interpreted as a topological obstacle which gives rise to a superselection rule
prohibiting any correlations between r- and l-particles. thus a rindler observer living in the r-wedge in no way can
inuence the part of the eld from the l-wedge and therefore elimination of the invisible left degrees of freedom
will take no eect for him. hence averaging over states of the eld in one wedge can not lead to thermalization of the
state in the other.

in algebraic approach the unruh eect is commonly identied with the bisogniano - wichmann theorem. accord-
ing to the bisogniano - wichmann theorem the minkowski vacuum expectation value of only those observables which
are entirely localized in the interior of the r-wedge constitutes the algebraic state which satises the kms condition
with respect to rindler timelike variable . this statement implies two points essential for its physical interpretation.
first, it is assumed that the observer which carries out measurements lives in ms. only then he could prepare the
minkowski vacuum state as the initial state of the eld. second, the variable  must coincide with proper time of
the observer. only then he can interpret the kms state as a thermal bath with davies - unruh temperature. but
the rindler observer can carry out measurements only inside the r-wedge and hence can not prepare the minkowski
vacuum state. from the other hand the variable  can not coincide with proper time of an observer which is an
inertial one at least asymptotically in far past and far future. nevertheless only such observer for whom inertial in-
and out- regions exist is able to prepare a state with nite number of particles in ms. these are the reasons why the
bisogniano - wichmann theorem is irrelevant for consideration of the unruh problem.

hence considerations of the unruh problem both in the standard and algebraic formulations of quantum eld
theory lead us to conclusion that principles of quantum eld theory does not give any grounds for existence of the
unruh eect.

nevertheless there exists another aspect of the unruh problem dealing with behaviour of a particular detector
uniformly accelerated in ms. the direct consideration of the behavior of a constantly accelerating physical detector
is a very dicult problem and its treatment in literature is very contradictory and often is simply erroneous. the
major diculty is that an object moving with a constant proper acceleration must be considered as a point object.
this is because dierent points of a nite size body rigid with respect to rindler coordinate frame move actually
with dierent accelerations. thus one should use an elementary particle or a microscopic bound system as a detector.
in both cases the detector is a quantum object moving along a denite classical trajectory. such assumption is in
contradiction with the uncertainty principle, its range of applicability is very limited and therefore it must be used
with proper care. moreover, it was shown by nikishov and ritus [38] that elementary particles placed in a constant
electric eld do not demonstrate the universal thermal response.

it is clear that a heavy atom for which wkb approach is valid satises physical claims for the detector much
better than an elementary particle. unfortunately a systematic relativistic theory of bound states is still absent.
utilization of non relativistic bound systems as detectors was discussed in ref. [57]. the ionization rate of a heavy
ion moving with a constant acceleration was considered. it was shown that the ionization rate diers from the one
obtained by virtue of the detailed balance principle applied to an atom immersed in a thermal bath with the davies-
unruh temperature. it was also shown that the time of thermal ionization (if it was at all possible) is parametrically
much greater than the time of destruction of the atom due to the tunneling ionization process in electric eld.

it is worth to add that in literature the unruh eect is usually explained by existence of event horizons for
a constantly accelerated observer. but we understand that the notion of a constantly accelerated observer is an
inadmissible idealization. it is clear that for any physical object the horizons are absent.

we certainly understand that behavior of accelerated detectors will dier from those at rest. we admit that
under some circumstances detectors of some special conguration will follow unruh behavior. but no conclusive proof
exists that this behavior is universal and does not depend on the nature of the detector and the accelerating eld.

since b(r)

 (z0) becomes singular when z0 tends to zero one should also consider the contribution of the

finally substituting eqs.(a4), (a6) and (a10) into eq.(a1) and taking limit z0  0 we obtain eq.(4.20).

appendix b: analogy between the unruh states and squeezed states of a

harmonic oscillator

1. consider a two dimensional harmonic oscillator in {x, y}-plain. the hamiltonian of such oscillator reads

hosc = b

+b+ + b

b + 1,

where

b+ =

1

2(cid:18)x +



x(cid:19) ,

b =

1

2(cid:18)y +



y(cid:19) ,

and the commutation relations are of the usual form,

[b, b

] = 1,

[b, b

] = 0.

the ground state |0i satises the condition

let us introduce the new operators r , l as

b|0i = 0.

26

(b1)

(b2)

(b3)

r = s()b+s() = cosh  b+ + sinh  b
,

l = s()bs() = sinh  b

+ + cosh  b,

where the unitary operator s() reads

s() = eig = exp{(b+b  b

2 ln(1  e2)hosc} exp(eb+b),

+b

)} = exp(eb
 =  ln tanh  > 0,

+b

) exp{ 1
0   < .

the operators (b4) obey the commutation relations in the form

[r , r

] = [l, l

] = 1,

[r , l] = 0.

note that the generator of the transformation (b5),

g = i(cid:18)x


y

+ y



x(cid:19) ,

looks very similar to the boost operator b, compare eq.(4.8).

according to eqs.(b2), (b4) we have

r|si = 0,

l|si = 0,

where

is a two dimensional squeezed vacuum state which in contrast to the ground state |0i is not stationary,

|si = s()|0i = (1  e2)1/2 exp(eb

+b

)|0i,

|s, ti = eiht|si = (1  e2)1/2 exp(e2itb

)|0i.

(b4)

(b5)

(b6)

(b7)

(b8)

(b9)

(b10)

for the amplitude of transition between the ground and squeezed vacuum states according to eq.(b9) we have

h0|si = z 1/2



, z = (1  e2)1,

and the expectation value of the number of squeezed quanta nr = r
h0|nr|0i = (e2  1)1 = sp (nrr),

r in the ground state reads

where

r = z 1



exp(2nr),

(b11)

(b12)

(b13)

and the partition function z is dened in eq.(b11).

the analogy between eqs.(b11,b12) and eq.(5.23) becomes evident after substitution  = . it is clear that
the appearance of the bose factor in eq.(5.20) results completely from the properties of bogolubov transformation
and does not relate to any sort of thermal behaviour.

2. we will show now that due to innite number of degrees of freedom in the unruh problem the considered
analogy is not complete and representation of canonical commutation relations in terms of the unruh operators is
unitary inequivalent to the standard one (in terms of the plain waves or boost operators).

one can write the relation between the unruh and boost operators in the form

r = cosh b + sinh b

,

l = sinh b

 + cosh b,

(b14)

with  dened by tanh  = exp(). the vacuum state of the eld in the double rindler wedge |0dwi ( called
sometimes the fulling vacuum, [12]) is dened by the requirements

r|0dwi = 0,

l|0dwi = 0,  > 0.

(b15)

27

if the fulling vacuum could be represented by the vector |0dwi in the same hilbert space where minkowski vacuum
state |0mi is dened then there should exist a unitary operator s such that

|0dwi = s|0mi, sbs = r, sbs = l.

(b16)

a simple calculation shows that such operator s has the following formal representation (compare to eq.(b5)):

s = exp




z0

d(bb  b

b

)
 .

it is obvious from this representation that |0dwi has the form

consider the matrix element

f [] = h0dw|0mi = h0m|s[]|0mi,

for arbitrary function . the derivative of the functional f [] can be expressed as follows (see e.g. sec. 2.4 of ref.
[56]),

for the last transformation in eq.(b20) we have used eqs.(b14) and the obvious formula

f

|0mi.

after simplication of eq.(b20) one obtains for the functional f [] the dierential equation ,

.

thus we obtain

i.e. k (0) in eq.(b18) vanishes. further with the help of eqs.(b21),(b23),(b24) we get

f = h0dw|0mi = exp((0)2/24) = 0,

(b24)

h0dw|b

|0mi =

f []



= (0) exp(  (0)2/24) = 0,

(b25)

i.e. k (2) = 0. processing further in such a way we conclude that |0dwi = 0. it means that there is no unruh vacuum
state in the same hilbert space where minkowski vacuum exists and that the unruh operators (b14) form unitary
inequivalent representation of commutation relations.

it is clear from eq.(6.10) (where for current consideration one should change |i to |0mi,  to 2 and |0ri|0li
. therefore we can also express eq.(b24) in the form z2 = exp((0)2/12) = 

to |0dwi) that h0dw|0mi = z 1/2

(compare to eq.(5.24)).
