(3) may invoke colemans theorem , based federbush-johnson- jost-schroer theorem . valid continuous symmetries states 1 invariance vacuum invariance world. consequently divergence dilatation current must vanish identically: = 0. (4) hand, divergence dilatation current determined trace anomaly qcd : = 1 2 (g) g ga g +xi mi i. (5) second term vanishes since mi = 0, = u, d, chiral limit. consequently, beta function must vanish: (g) = 0. (6) observe callan-symanzik beta function gauge independent minimal subtraction scheme qcd . ask zero beta function is: either g = g 6= 0 g = 0. know asymptotically free theory qcd must g = 0 ultraviolet stable xed point. beta function due asymptotic freedom negative small coupling (provided nf 16), remains negative couplings way eective coupling constant grows without bounds large distances (i.e., quark connement) . words, connement requires curve (g) function g remains positive g axis, decreases g increases never turns . rules rst possibility. consequence, possible solution g = 0 (7) theory reduced triviality. therefore conclude reductio ad absurdum, scale invariance must broken spontaneously qcd vacuum state: qd(t) |0 >6= 0. (8) since qcd nontrivial theory g 6= 0, scale invariance also explicitly broken trace anomaly, eq.(5), consequence, goldstone theorem  dilaton. words, scale invariance broken spontaneously vacuum state explicitly trace anomaly. 2 point shall rst establish vanishing commutator dilatation charge qd(t)and axial charge qa 5(t) = 0. shall begin fact qa(0), = 1, 2, , 8, generators su(3) transformations satisfy algebra consistent  = ifabcqc(0).  = idqqa(0) (9) (10)  scale dimension charge zero: dq = 0 . explicitly proved follows. consider double commutator  = ifabc = fabcdqqc(0). (11) employing jacobi identity, reduces idq + idq = fabcdqqc(0) (12) satised dq = 0. extend axial-charge qa employing commutators 5  = ifabcqc(t),  = idq5qa 5(0), (13) (14) dq5 scale dimension axial-charge. evaluating double commutator qd(0), nd  = ifabc = dqfabcqc(0) = 0. employ jacobi identity, obtain 2idq5 = 2dq5fabcqc(0) = 0. 3 (15) (16) again, satised scale dimension axial charge vanishes: dq5 = 0 hence follows  = 0. introducing eiht left, eiht right 1 = eiht eiht middle, establish vanishing commutator dilatation charge axial charge time:  = 0. shall establish result spontaneously broken scale invariance implies spontaneously broken chiral symmetry. shall employ method reductio ad absurdum. already proved scale invariance spontaneously broken thus qd(t)|0 >6= 0. means dilatation charge annihilate vacuum instead operation produces another state: qd(t)|0 >= |1(t) >, |1(t) >6= |0 >. dilatation charge time dependent hence commute hamiltonian. result, states produced repeated application dilatation charge operator neither vacuum states necessarily degenerate. spontaneously broken scale invariance imply spontaneously broken chiral symmetry? let us assume contrary chiral symmetry unbroken, qa 5(t) qd(t) commute, therefore obtain 5(t)|0 >= 0. since qa qa 5(t)qd(t)|0 >= qa 5(t)|1(t) >= qd(t)qa 5(t)|0 >= 0. (17) hence conclude qa reasoning obtain result 5(t)|1(t) >= 0. next may consider qa 5(t)qd(t)|1(t) > qa 5(t)qd(t)|1(t) >= qa 5(t)|2(t) >= qd(t)qa 5(t)|1(t) >= 0. (18) hence deduce: qa manner nd axial charge annihilates states |1(t) >, |2(t) >, |3(t) > on, ad innitum, |0 >6= |1(t) >6= |2(t) >6= |3(t) >. thus deduced result 5(t)|2(t) >= 0. qa 5(t)|n(t) >= 0, n = 1, 2, 3, . (19) clearly eq.(19) satised wigner-weyl mode, i.e., |n(t) >= |0 >, n, unitary transformation u commutes 5. however, states |n(t) > neither vacuum eigenstates necessarily degenerate since qd(t) 6= 0 virtue trace anomaly. consequence, identication broken scale vacuum chirally symmetric vacuum wrong must rejected. hence conclude reductio ad absurdum qa 5(t)|0 >6= 0: chiral symmetry must spontaneously broken. 4 may also infer connection states |n(t) > degenerate 5(t)|0 >6= 0 qd(t)|0 >6= 0, derive 5(t)] = 0 qa 5(t)|0 >= 5(t)|0 >= |0 >6= |0 >. hence determine 5)1(t)qd(t)|0 > desired connection hidden scale symmetry 5(t)|0 >6= 0. vacuum states follows. since qa commutator property  limit zero mass u, d, quarks: 1(p) = /pa(p2) d(p2) (21) d(p2) dynamical quark mass. corresponds form quark propagator covariant gauge presence gluons quantum chromodynam- ics. function really function dimensionless variable p2/2 subtraction point. arguments valid also su(2) su(2) fabc replaced abc. address question goldstone theorem  qcd. following cornwalls analysis , examine ward-takahashi identity satised proper, renormalized, color singlet, avor non-singlet axial-vector current vertex function qcd limit zero mass u, d, quarks: qa 5(p, p) = zaz 1 2 (cid:20)s 1(p)5 1 2 + 5 1 2 1(p)(cid:21) , (22) q = p p, avor su(3) matrix = 1, 2, , 8. since established chiral symmetry must broken spontaneously, signied n5, 1(p)o 6= 0, qa 5(p, p) = 2zaz 1 2 5 1 2 ad(p2) 6= 0. follows therefore lim q0 lim q0 5 = 1 2 a(2zaz 1 2 5d(p2) q q2 + ) , 5 (23) (24) (25) omitted terms regular  q = 0 hence axial-vector vertex function must pole q2 = 0. establishes goldstone theorem qcd. conclusion, dealt question chiral symmetric mode qcd nambu-goldstone realization chiral symmetry. known choice two longer free us. indeed, theory should, principle, tell us whether symmetry part spontaneously broken . precisely attempted work utilizing colemans theorem employing twin ingredients asymptotic freedom connement qcd. interesting note marciano pagels  observed deeper connection trace anomaly qcd mass spectrum connement, exists, remains understood. believe shed light question.
