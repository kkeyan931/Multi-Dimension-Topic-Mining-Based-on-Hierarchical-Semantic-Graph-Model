abstract

there is substantial evidence that string theory on ads5  s5 is a
holographic theory in which the number of degrees of freedom scales as
the area of the boundary in planck units. precisely how the theory can
describe bulk physics using only surface degrees of freedom is not well
understood. a particularly paradoxical situation involves an event
deep in the interior of the bulk space. the event must be recorded
in the (schroedinger picture) state vector of the boundary theory
long before a signal, such as a gravitational wave, can propagate from
the event to the boundary. in a previous paper with polchinski, we
argued that the precursor operators which carry information stored
in the wave during the time when it vanishes in a neighborhood of the
boundary are necessarily nonlocal. in this paper we argue that the
precursors cannot be products of local gauge invariant operators such
as the energy momentum tensor. in fact gauge theories have a class
of intrinsically nonlocal operators which cannot be built from local
gauge invariant objects. these are the wilson loops. we show that
the precursors can be identied with wilson loops whose spatial size
is dictated by the uvir connection.

description entails a vast reduction of the number of degrees of freedom
needed to describe a region of bulk spacetime. despite the large amount of
circumstantial evidence for the holographic principle it is still very mysterious
how such a sparse set of degrees of freedom can describe all local bulk physics.
a particular challenge is to understand how events deep in the interior of the
bulk space are recorded in the instantaneous (schroedinger picture) state
vector of the boundary theory long before a signal can propagate from the
event to the boundary [4].

let us consider an example. for deniteness we will consider the 3+1
dimensional super yang mills description of bulk physics in 5 dimensional
ads space 1[5][6][7]. we will be interested in the limit of large radius of
curvature compared to the string scale. in this limit stringy excitations are
negligible and the low energy supergravity approximation to bulk physics
is reliable. on the sym side we must take n large keeping the t hooft
coupling constant g2n xed and large.

suppose as in [4] an event takes place at the center 2 of ads which radiates
a gravitational wave toward the boundary. no signal including the wave itself
can arrive at the boundary until a certain time elapses. if the original event
is well localized near the center of a very large ads space, the original bulk
elds will typically be very spherically symmetric and time independent. in
fact the only bulk eld of importance is the timetime component of the
metric whose behavior near the boundary records the presence of a certain
amount of energy in the interior. on the sym side this means that the
energy momentum tensor is almost exactly homogeneous and consists of an
homogeneous energy density and the pressure needed to make ht 
 i = 0.
however, this eect is featureless and provides no information about the
prole of the gravitational wave. in addition, it is vanishingly small in the
large n limit since corrections to the metric due to the energy of the wave are

smaller than the wave itself by factors of g5  n1. we refer the reader

in [4] for notations and conventions. thus, within a neighborhood of the
boundary, all supergravity eld functionals retain their original, vacuum
like expectation values, at least until light has had a chance to propagate
from r  0 to the boundary. the implication for the sym theory is that
all expectation values of local gauge invariant operators corresponding to the
bulk elds, as well as expectation values of products of such operators, should
initially be identical to their vacuum values and contain no information about
the propagating wave.

this situation continues until the outgoing wave arrives at the boundary.
at that time the perturbation on the boundary becomes nonzero and begins

1the usual s5 factor in the correspondence plays no role in the present paper and will

be ignored.

origin of cavity coordinates.

oscillating over the whole 3-sphere. from the sym point of view, the energy
momentum tensor and its products suddenly begin to coherently oscillate.
the features of the gravitational wave can then be recovered from expectation
values of the energy momentum tensor and its products.

thus during the time when the wave vanishes within a neighborhood of
the boundary, the sym theory is excited to a non-vacuum-like state which
we cannot distinguish from the vacuum by taking expectation values of local
gauge invariant operators or any of their products3. in [4], it was argued that
the holographic boundary theory must contain special non-local operators,
called precursors, that distinguish such states and code in detail local bulk
information. the precursors should become increasingly non-local the further
the corresponding bulk process is from the boundary in accordance with the
uvir connection [3]. in those cases when the boundary theory has a gauge
symmetry, the precursors must also be gauge invariant since they contain
physical information. in the case of n = 4 sym theory, this suggests that
the precursors are wilson loops whose size is dictated by the uvir relation.
we remark that there exists a rich class of generalized, equaltime wilson
loops being candidates for the precursors. apart from conventional spatial
wilson loops, we may consider spatial wilson loops with insertions of local
gauge covariant operators. for example, we can consider the operator

t rp f(x1)f (x2)w,

(1.1)

where w is a wilson loop passing through the points x1 and x2 and p
denotes path ordering. presumably, such operators and their products form
a complete set of observables in the boundary theory.

in [4], it was shown how a plane gravitational wave can be modeled by
squeezed states constructed in free eld theory. in particular, it was shown
how to account for the oscillating energy density and the apparent acausality
in the behavior of the energy momentum tensor required by the correspon-
dence. it was found that this behavior is consistent with bounds required by
general principles of quantum mechanics. in addition, apart from possible
numerical coecients, the free eld theory model reproduces corrections to
the linearized solution induced by non-linear terms in einsteins equations
involving the energy density of the wave.

in this note we model bulk waves with squeezed states constructed
in the interacting sym theory. we compute expectation values of local
gauge invariant operators in the squeezed states and match them with the
boundary data of the wave. we show that expectation values of products
of local gauge invariant operators contain no additional information about
the prole of the wave in agreement with bulk causality. our computations

3 we are assuming that local gauge invariant operators are in onetoone correspon-

dence with local observables of the bulk theory evaluated near the boundary.

are done in the t hooft limit keeping only the leading terms in the 1/n
expansion. finally, using the corespondence, we calculate expectation values
of wilson loops in the squeezed states and show how they carry non-trivial
information if their size is as dictated by the uvir connection. we discuss
the implications of our results for holography at the end.

before concluding the introduction we will review some facts and con-
ventions about the adscft correspondence. the metric of ads in cavity
coordinates is

ds2 = r2" (1 + r2)2

(1  r2)2 dt2 

= r2ds2,

4

(1  r2)2 (dr2 + r2d2)#

(1.2)

where the coordinates and ds2 are dimensionless and d2 is the metric of
the unit 3-sphere. the center of ads means the point r = 0. near a point
of the boundary at r = 1 the metric has the form

ds2 = r2(cid:20) 1

z2 (dt2  dz2  dxidxi)(cid:21)

(1.3)

where z = 1  r and x1, x2, x3 replace the coordinates of the 3-sphere. for
our purposes the metric (1.3) is to be regarded as a local approximation to
the cavity metric. it is true, but irrelevant to our purposes, that the same
metric also gives an exact description of a patch of ads space. in any case we
will call these the halfplane coordinates. the two dimensionless parameters
r/ls and gs of the bulk theory  ls is the string length scale  are related to
the sym quantities n and g by

r/ls = (g2n)1/4

gs = g2.

the 5 and 10 dimensional newton constants are given by

g5 = g10/r5
g10 = g2

s l8
s.

(1.4)

(1.5)

we set r = 1 for simplicity. the string length scale is then given by ls =
1/(g2n)1/4. throughout we neglect numerical factors of order unity.

2 bulk waves

as in [4], we model bulk waves with squeezed states in the boundary theory.
our goal is to study expectation values of various operators in the squeezed
states and identify the precursors that store local bulk information.

4

for deniteness, let us consider a gravitational wave propagating radially
outward from r  0. in the next section, we will be interested in the case
of a dilaton wave. assume that the wave is in one of the lowest spherical
harmonics on the 3sphere. in halfplane coordinates the plane fronted wave
has the form

(z, x, t) = qg5

where (z, x, t) is dened by

(z, t)

,

z2

(2.1)

(2.2)

ds2 = (cid:20) 1

z2 (dt2  dz2  dxidxi)(cid:21) + (z, x, t)dxdx

and  is a transverse traceless polarization tensor with nonvanishing com-
ponents in the x directions. the polarization tensor is assumed normalized
to unity.

far away from the original sources, (z, t) satises the same wave equa-
tion as a free, minimally coupled, massless scalar eld in ads. we use normal-
ization conventions so that (z, t) is canonically normalized. thus we keep
the amplitude |(z, t)| nite, independent of n, and the energy of the wave
is nite. the corresponding operator in the sym theory is ijtij/n. the
2-point function of this operator is of order n 0. non-linear terms in the grav-
itational eld equations are suppressed by additional factors of g5  n1

and will be ignored in this paper 4.

near the boundary, normalizable solutions to the wave equation behave

as follows

(z, t)  z4z d||3()eit,

(2.3)

with () = () since the eld is real. according to the adscft cor-
respondence, the wave makes a contribution to the sym energy momentum
tensor given by [11]

tij
n i  ijz4(z, t)|z=0.

h

(2.4)

we are interested in describing a wave emitted at a particular time t0
in the past, near r  0, so that, when t < 0, the perturbation vanishes
within a neighborhood of the boundary. this can be achieved if we choose
the function ||3() to be analytic in the upper half plane and have the
right asymptotic behavior as   i. then the boundary data vanish for
t < 0 and so does the contribution to < t /n >. in general, the boundary
data will be non-vanishing when t > 0 since () will have singularities

4 in [4], these eects were included and it was shown how they can be reproduced
in free eld theory up to possible numerical coecients.
in the large n limit they are
suppressed. however, they are important to recover consistency in the behavior of the
energy momentum tensor required by general principles of quantum mechanics. we refer
the reader to refs. [4][10] for a discussion of this point.

in the lower half-plane. also, causality of the bulk theory insures that the
function (z, t) describes a wave which, at any t0 < t < 0, exactly vanishes
for z < |t|.
in addition, bulk causality requires that all local bulk elds
evaluated in a neighborhood of the boundary, as well as products of such
elds, retain their vacuum expectation values until t = 0. therefore, on the
sym side, expectation values of local gauge invariant operators and their
products must be identical to their vacuum values until t = 0.

squeezed states in yangmills theory

we propose that during the propagation of the wave, the sym theory is

excited in the squeezed state dened by

|i = exp"iij

n z d3~xdtf (t)tij(~x, t)#|i ,

(2.5)

where |i is the vacuum of the interacting theory and f (t) is some real
function related to the boundary data of the wave. the polarization ij is
taken to be traceless and symmetric. it will turn out to be the polarization
of the wave. the state thus dened is unitnormalized 5.

our motivation in writing eq(2.5) is as follows. in the large n limit with
the t hooft coupling held xed and large, |i corresponds to a coherent
state in the bulk. to see this note that if we fourier expand any local gauge
invariant operator o(~x, t)

o(~x, t) = z>0

dd3~ko(, ~k)eit+i~x~k + h.c.,

(2.6)

then, to leading order in 1/n, the positive frequency modes o(, ~k) behave
like annihilation operators and the negative frequency modes o(, ~k) behave
like creation operators [13]. in particular, their commutator is a cnumber
function. thus, up to some irrelevant normalization factor, the state |i
takes the form
(2.7)

|i  exp(cid:20)z df ()o(, 0)(cid:21)|i .

we see that if we identify the sym vacuum with the bulk vacuum and the
modes o(, ~k) with the fourier modes of the bulk eld corresponding to o,
|i becomes a coherent bulk state. this can always be done in the limit we
are considering since in this limit, the relation

o(x) = z4(z, x)|z0

(2.8)

holds as an exact operator relation [12][13]. coherent states in the bulk
describe classical waves.

5in the free theory, to leading order in 1/n , it reduces to the squeezed state considered
in [4], up to some normalization factor. also, the energy momentum tensor is normal
ordered so that the vacuum energy density is zero.

h|
all other components of the energy momentum tensor have zero expectation
value in this state. in the t hooft limit and to leading order in 1/n, the com-
mutator [tij(y), tmn(x)] is a cnumber function proportional to the central
charge of the theory. therefore, it is of order n 2. in fact, it is independent of
the t hooft coupling and can be calculated in the free theory. this function
vanishes both inside and outside the light-cone; it receives contributions only
when the points x and y are at lightlike separation. hence, we can commute
t (y) past the exponential picking a factor proportional to this commutator.
recall also that the energy momentum tensor has zero expectation value in
the vacuum. then, to leading order in 1/n, the expectation value is given
by

tij(~y,  )

|i =

(2.11)

the expectation value inside the integral is in the vacuum.

the details of the calculation can be found in the appendix. here, we
write down the results. the spatial integral is imaginary and independent of
~y. simple dimensional analysis shows that it behaves like

1

state is given by

(2.13)

(2.14)

(2.15)

comparing with eq(2.3), we must set

()  if ().

(2.16)

note that we have chosen () so that the boundary data vanish for t < 0.
this does not imply that f (t) is zero for t < 0.

finally, consider expectation values of products of the energy momentum
tensor. using the same method as before, we can easily see that these will
dier from their vacuum values only by products of commutators. schemat-
ically, we have

1
n 2 h| t1t2 |i =

1
n 2 h| t1t2 |i 

1

n 2 z [t2, t ]z [t1, t ].

(2.17)

the non-trivial component is just the product h| t1 |ih| t2 |i. there-
fore, for t1, t2 < 0, the expectation value is identical to its vacuum value since
each factor vanishes by construction. in any case, products of local gauge
invariant operators contain no additional information about the prole of the
wave. this is of course a consequence of large n factorization.

3 wilson loops

in this section we show how the expectation value of a wilson loop in a
squeezed state carries non-trivial information about a dilaton wave. since we
are interested in the instantaneous state vector, a wilson loop will typically
mean a spatial loop with no extension in the time direction. to model a
dilaton wave in the sym theory, we replace ijtij/n with o = t rf 2/n in
eq(2.5).

we consider a conventional wilson loop

w (c) = t rp eih adx

(3.1)

for simplicity. in the t hooft limit and large t hooft coupling, the vacuum
expectation value of this loop can be obtained from the area of a minimal
world-sheet in ads that ends on the loop at the boundary [8]. we consider
a spatial wilson loop evaluated at  < 0 and oriented in the x1  x2 plane.
we take the loop to be circular with size a. we regularize the vev of this
loop by dividing the divergent term proportional to the circumference.

we wish to calculate the expectation value h| w |i in the case when
f is small. in this case, we can expand the exponential keeping only linear
terms in f . we do not expect higher order terms to modify our conclusions
signicantly, since in the t hooft limit their expectation values should factor-
ize into products involving the linear term together with featureless factors
such as the vev of the loop itself.

8

then the expectation value reduces to the following expression involving

the commutator of the loop with the operator o

h| w |i = hwi + iz dtd3~xf (t)h[w ( ), o(~x, t)]i.

(3.2)

all expectation values in the rhs of the equation are vacuum expectation
values. the rst term is irrelevant to us since, by conformal invariance, it
should be independent of the size of the loop a and  . in terms of time
ordered vacuum expectation values the second term takes the form

iz dtd3~xf (t)(  t)hhw ( )o(~x, t)i dw ( )o(~x, t)ei.

(3.3)

the hermitian conjugate of the loop operator is obtained by reversing the
orientation of the loop in the x1  x2 plane.
the euclidean version of the 2-point functions appearing in eq(3.3) has
been computed in [9] using the correspondence. one rst nds a minimal
world-sheet with the loop as its boundary. the world-sheet in turn induces
a source term in the dilaton eld equations through the coupling

1

2 z d2he



2 .

(3.4)

here, hij is the metric induced on the world-sheet when the background
metric is in the einstein frame. the term in the world-sheet action involving
the curvature of the world-sheet is suppressed when the t hooft coupling
is large and can be ignored. the 2-point function is given by the boundary
data of the dilaton prole obtained by solving the classical eld equations in
the presence of the source. it depends only on two parameters, which are the
polar co-ordinate of the operator o on the plane dened by the loop r and
3 [9]:

its perpendicular distance from the plane of the loop y = q(t   )2 + x2

(3.5)

hw ( )o(~x, t)i  hwi

n

a4

h(y2 + r2  a2)2 + 4a2y2i2 .

we see that the 2-point function behaves like 1/d4 when the operator ap-

proaches the loop, where d = qy2 + (r  a)2 is the distance of the operator
from the loop. to obtain the expression in minkowski signature, we replace
(  t)2  (  t)2 + i.
before we continue with our calculation, we make some remarks about this
correlation function. first, we see that it is of order n 0 since the expectation
value of the loop itself is of order n. in fact, we may think of the operator
o = t rf 2/n as a small wilson loop. the disconnected part of the 2-point
function is zero since o has vanishing vev. the connected part of the 2-
point function receives contributions from world-sheets in the bulk that have

9

the two loops as boundaries. the topology of these surfaces implies that the
2-point function is of order zero in the large n expansion. second, reversing
the orientation of the loop does not change the result for the dilaton prole
since the coupling of the world-sheet in the bulk to the dilaton eld, eq(3.4),
remains the same. hence, eq(3.2) reduces to the following expression

h| w |i = hwi  2z dtf (t)(  t)imz d3~xhw ( )o(~x, t)i.

(3.6)

first we do the spatial integral over the 2-point function and obtain the

imaginary part as a function of the ratio

 = |  t|

a

.

(3.7)

we also rescale x3 and r so that the variables of integration are dimensionless.
in polar co-ordinates the integral takes the form

i =

2

a z drdx3

r

3  a2 + i]2 [x2
[x2

3  b2 + i]2 ,

where

and

a2 = 2  (r  1)2

b2 = 2  (r + 1)2.

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

the integrand has poles when a2 and b2 are positive. therefore the integral
has non-vanishing imaginary part. we explain the physical origin of these
poles at the end of this section. we integrate over x3 rst, closing the contour
from below and picking up the residues at the poles in the lower-half plane.
only non-negative real poles contribute to the imaginary part as a result of
the i prescription.

in the appendix, we analyze the behavior of the imaginary part of the

integral for three cases. when   1, we nd
a4

im(i) 

1
a5 =

|  t|5 .

(3.11)

the result is identical to the result found in eq.(2.12) for the case of local
operators. this is of course the behavior one should expect to see. in this
case, the temporal separation between the loop and the operator o is much
bigger than the size of the loop, and we should be able to use the operator
product expansion of the loop in terms of local gauge invariant operators to
calculate the 2-point function. note also that the 2-point function behaves
like

(3.12)

hw oi 

a4

[x2  (  t)2]4
10

when   1, as the 2-point function of o with itself. as   1, the imaginary
part increases. when   1, it is the biggest and behaves like

im(i) 

1

a(  1)3/2 .

when   1, we nd that the imaginary part tends to zero like

im(i) 

2
a

.

(3.13)

(3.14)

we can understand the result as follows. as explained below, in this case, the
imaginary part of the integral receives contributions only when the operator is
very close to the loop at r  1 and x3  0. their temporal separation is also
small. thus, using the heisenberg equations of motion, we can approximate
o(~x, t) with

o(~x, t) = o(~x,  )  to(~x, t)|t= (  t).

(3.15)

we see that the operator o commutes with the wilson loop unless the two
are in contact. essentially, only a single point of the loop contributes to the
commutator, a measure zero eect. the commutator in turn determines the
imaginary part of the integral as we can see from eq(3.2) and eq(3.3). so
we expect the imaginary part of the integral to vanish like a power of 2 or
faster.

let us now see how the expectation value of the wilson loop in the

squeezed state

h|w ( )|i = 2z dtf (t)(  t)im(i)

(3.16)

carries information about the corresponding dilaton wave. the imaginary
part of the integral is a function of  = |  t|/a. as before, we choose f (t)
so that h|o( )|i exactly vanishes when  < 0. at any  < 0, the corre-
sponding bulk wave vanishes for z < ||. on the other hand, the expectation
value of the wilson loop has non-trivial time dependence when  < 0. early
in the remote past, when ||  a, we can approximate im(i)  1/|  t|5.
therefore, the expectation value tends to zero since it behaves exactly the
same way as the expectation value of local gauge invariant operators given
in eq(2.13). when ||  a, the imaginary part of i is essentially indepen-
dent of  within most of the domain of integration but a small interval when
|t|  ||. thus the expectation value receives its timedependence from
this small region of integration. within this region though,   1 and so
the imaginary part of i is tiny. hence, the expectation value is featureless
having essentially no timedependence. when ||  a, the expectation value
receives non-trivial timedependence due to competition eects between f (t)
and the imaginary part of i. it receives its biggest contribution from the re-
gion of integration near t  0 since then   1 and the imaginary part of

11

i diverges. when ||  a, the wave is at co-ordinate distance  a from the
boundary. thus the wilson loop detects the wave when its distance from
the boundary is comparable to the size of the loop, and reproduces details
that depend on the prole of the wave. this is of course a manifestation of
the uvir relation [3].

another interesting example, is the case when f (t) is oscillatory near t = 0
and exponentially small otherwise. the oscillations are well concentrated
near t = 0. for example, we may take f (t) to be a polynomial in t times a
gaussian. at any time  other than zero, the corresponding bulk wave should
be oscillatory near z = || and very small in a neighborhood of the boundary.
in this case, expectation values of local gauge invariant operators behave like

h|o( )|i 

f (0)t
||5

(3.17)

and so they remain small until the wave is at the boundary at  = 0. here,
t is the characteristic decay time of the oscillations in f (t). the expectation
value of the wilson loop though has very dierent timedependence. again,
using the results for the behavior of the imaginary part of i as a function
of the ratio ||/a, one can see that the expectation value is oscillatory when
||  a and suppressed when ||  a or ||  a.
in short, when the wave is very close to the boundary, only small wilson
loops are excited. at that time, however, expectation values of local gauge
invariant operators begin to oscillate. on the other hand, when the wave
is far from the boundary only big wilson are excited. this shows that the
precursors are in fact wilson loops.

finally, let us try and understand the physical origin of the poles in the
integrand in eq(3.8). when the denominators vanish, the 2-point function
has non-vanishing imaginary part since then the i prescription for treating
the poles becomes relevant. as one can see from eq(3.2) and eq(3.3), the
imaginary part of the 2-point function is determined by the vacuum expecta-
tion value of the commutator between the wilson loop and the operator o.
therefore, at the poles the commutator is non-vanishing. now, the commu-
tator can be non-zero only when some part of the loop of non-trivial measure
is on the light-cone of o. then the commutator between the vector potential
at any point whose separation from o is light-like and o is non-zero, and in
turn all of them contribute to the commutator between the wilson loop itself
and o. this is precisely what happens at the poles as we show below. the
imaginary part of the 2-point function vanishes when the loop is not inter-
secting the light-cone, and the contribution to the integral from this region
of integration is real. then, the 2-point function is non-singular as well.

suppose the operator is at t = 0. then the loop can intersect with the
past light-cone of o only. for |x3| < , the light-cone intersects the x1  x2

12

plane at a circle of radius

 = q2  x2

3.

(3.18)

the polar co-ordinate r of o is the distance of the center of this circle from
the center of the loop. the point of the loop closest to the center of the light-
cone circle is at distance |r  1| from it, while the one that is the farthest
is at distance r + 1. clearly, when a2 is negative, the loop is outside the
light-cone and so no contributions to the imaginary part of the integral arise
from this region of integration for any .

when a2 is positive the loop and the light-cone circle intersect. we may
choose, however, |x3| = a so that the two circles are tangent to each other.
this is precisely when the integrand is singular. when the two circles are
tangent the set of points on the loop that are close enough to the light-cone
is of bigger measure and we get a contribution to the commutator and a
pole in the 2-point function. for  > 1 the light-cone circle is tangent to
the loop from the outside. the opposite is true for  < 1. in this case, the
light-cone circle becomes smaller and smaller as   0 and the eect ceases
to be important.
for   1, we can choose x3 small enough so that  is bigger than the
radius of the loop. if b2 is positive, then, for |x3| < b, the loop is inside the
light-cone. for |x3| = b the two circles are tangent and again we have a pole
in the 2-point function.
for   1, the 2-point function becomes even more singular when a = b
at r = 0 and  = 1.
in this case, the whole loop is on the light-cone.
therefore, we should expect a big contribution to the imaginary part of the
integral from the small r region. we expect this eect to amplify when   1
since then, x3  0, and the operator is closer to the plane of the loop. note
also that the 2-point function is as singular when a or b are zero and x3 = 0.
the two eects combine when  = 1. the 2-point function can be the most
singular in this case and we expect the imaginary part of the integral to be
the biggest.

4 discussion

the main purpose of this paper is to identify the non-local precursor elds
of the sym boundary theory that record information about local processes
occurring deep in the interior of the bulk ads spacetime. causality of the
bulk theory requires that the precursors are intrinsically non-local. they are
not simple products of local operators corresponding to the classical super-
gravity elds in the standard adscft dictionary. correlation functions of
such products essentially remain featureless until the signal from the event
arrives at the boundary. yet, as in [4], we argue that the precursors store
the information long before the signal can propagate to the boundary.

13

in this paper, we study a rather simple case involving the propagation of
a classical bulk wave toward the boundary. it is shown that when the wave
vanishes within a neighborhood of the boundary, products of local gauge
invariant operators retain their vacuum expectation values, whereas wilson
loops are excited when their size is of the same order as the co-ordinate
distance of the wave from the boundary. a detailed translation of all the
congurations of the bulk theory to the sym theory is not yet available,
but, as in the example of the wave, we believe that the precursors will in-
volve wilson loops with size dictated by the uvir connection. the precise
way wilson loops would store information about complicated processes in the
bulk is very dicult to see. in particular, it remains a challenge to under-
stand what precursors describe small schwarzschild black holes at the center
of ads, or what congurations of wilson loops provide the signal that a black
hole forms in a head-on collision of two very energetic gravitons [4]. how-
ever, wilson loops and their products form a complete set of gauge invariant
operators in the sym theory. this means that at any time one should be
able to recover all the information about the state of the theory from their
expectation values and expectation values of their products.

our analysis has been carried out in the t hooft limit where we keep the
t hooft coupling xed and large and take n  . in this limit the bulk
theory is manifestly local as it is well described by linearized supergravity.
we do not consider 1/n corrections in this paper since they are too small.
we think that their eect is to modify the original expectation values of local
gauge invariant operators by featureless components that do not carry any
interesting information about the details of the relevant bulk process. for
example, in the case of the gravitational wave considered in section ii, the
nexttoleading order 1/n corrections depend on the energy density of the
wave, which is (almost) uniform, but not on the detailed prole of the wave.
any interesting eect of bulk interactions should be recovered from such
expectation values only when the signal of the event arrives at the boundary.
we believe that the squeezed states constructed in the sym theory con-
tinue to accurately describe gravitational waves including the eect of bulk
interactions. evidence for this was found in [4], where the success of the
free eld theory model considered was linked with the non-renormalization
theorem for the 3-point function of the energy momentum tensor. it would
be very interesting to study the exact description of a gravitational wave in
the at space limit considered in [15][16]. in this limit we take n large and
g xed. we also keep bulk energies xed in string units. this means that
we have to consider energies in the sym theory that scale like n 1/4. in at
space, plane gravitational waves are exact solutions of the theory and do not
receive any stringy corrections [17]. however, we do not have any computa-
tional control in the sym theory in this limit apart from non-renormalization
theorems for the 2-point and 3-point functions of chiral primaries.

14

what really distinguishes the precursors in the case of n = 4 sym theory
from other non-local observables in the theory is that wilson loops cannot
be expressed in terms of nite polynomials of local gauge invariant opera-
tors corresponding to the bulk elds. gauge invariance equips the boundary
holographic theory with this rich class of intrinsically non-local observables
so that it can reproduce traces of bulk causality and locality. thus gauge in-
variance is crucial in the way this particular local conformal theory describes
bulk physics. it would be interesting to understand the precise nature of the
precursors in other adscft dualities in which the cft is not a gauge the-
ory. for example, the ads3 case.6 in all these examples the cft is obtained
from a gauge theory through renormalization group ows; however there is
no remnant of the original gauge symmetry at the xed point. it is partic-
ularly challenging to nd special non-local observables in these examples as
well so as to understand better the holographic nature of gravity.

appendix a

in this appendix, we show how to compute the expectation value of the
energy momentum tensor in the squeezed state as given in eq(2.10):

n 2 z dtf (t)(  t)imz d3~xhtij(~y,  )tmn(~x, t)i.

(a.1)

the 2-point function can be found in [6]. it is given by

htij(~y,  )tmn(~x, t)i  n 2xijmn

1

[(~x  ~y)2  (  t)2 + i]2 ,

(a.2)

where we drop numerical factors of order unity. the tensor xijmn involves
terms with four derivatives with respect to y. the precise formula can be
found in [6].

next we calculate the integral

scale |t| = |  t| out of the integral to obtain the following expression

where

using integration by parts we can simplify the integral as follows

this integral can be done by contour integration. we close the contour from
below picking up the residue at the pole x = 1  i/2. we nd

i =

.

(a.7)

since the integral is independent of ~y only the term with four timederivatives
in xijmn contributes to the expectation value. then the expectation value
reduces to the following expression

ijz dtf (t)(  t)4

   1
|  t|! .

(a.8)

this is the same expression as equation eq(2.13) in section ii.

(b.1)

where a2 = 2  (r  1)2 and b2 = 2  (r + 1)2 as dened in section iii.
we rst do the x3integration closing the contour from below and evaluating
the residue at the poles. only real poles contribute to the imaginary part of
the integral. we study the cases  > 1 and  < 1 separately. for  > 1, a2
is positive for 0 < r <  + 1 and b2 is positive for 0 < r <   1. for  < 1,
a2 is positive for  + 1 < r <  + 1 while b2 is negative for all values of r.
for  > 1, the imaginary part of i is obtained from the imaginary part
of the following expression

the integrand in i1 looks singular at r = 0, but in fact it behaves like r0

next, consider i2. the integrand is singular at r = 1 when b = 0, but
as we will show the imaginary part is nite. the small number  regulates
the imaginary part. the imaginary part is given by

similarly, if we change variables

the imaginary part of i3 becomes

combining the two we are left with the following simpler integrals

(b.17)
in x2 we drop the terms proportional to  since the integrand is well behaved
within the domain of integration. this integral can be obtained in terms of
logarithms. we do not write the whole expression down. rather, we write
its series expansion in terms of powers of 1/:

x2 =

(b.18)

next we calculate x1. first choose a cut-o  which we will take to be zero
at the end. we must take the limit   0 rst. then x1 reduces to the
following two pieces

(b.21)

the second piece reduces to

2

2

32  4

(b.22)

we see that after taking the   0 limit the singular term of order 1/ cancels
and we are left with a nite result. taylor-expanding in powers of 1/ yields

adding the result to x2 obtained in eq(b.18), we nd

(b.23)

(b.24)

since i1  1/5 as well, the imaginary part of i decreases like 5.
then we study the case when   1+. we set   1 = e and obtain the
imaginary part as a power series expansion in e. we show that the imaginary
part behaves like e3/2. we study the imaginary part of each of the following
integrals

and

i3 =

here, d is a small number that regulates each of the integrals near r = 0. at
the end, after taking d  0, the sum of i2 and i3 will turn out to be nite
independent of d.
to evaluate the imaginary part of i2, we do the same change of variables as
before, eq(b.12), and obtain the same expression as eq(b.13) but now with

the domain of integration being 0 < x < q2(e  d) + e2. for i3, however,
we cannot use the same change of variables as in eq.(b.14) within the whole
domain of integration since, for r < 1, r  1 is negative. when r < 1, we
must set
(b.27)

1  r = 2  x2.

then the imaginary part of i3 is given by eq(b.15) plus an additional term

first note that

x2 + o(e).

(b.32)

this in turn is of order d, and, therefore, it vanishes since we take d  0.
the rst integral can be calculated as before. the small number  regulates
the integral near the lower limit x = 0, exactly the same way as before. we
are left with

x1 = 

1

qe(2 + e)d

+ f inite in d.

(b.33)

here, the nite piece in d is of order e3/2. the singular term of order d1
arises from the second piece of the integrand which diverges like

1

hqe(2 + e)  xi2

(b.34)

near the upper limit of integration. finally, consider the integral x3. this
should be dominated by the singular terms near the lower limit of integration.

near the upper limit of integration the integrand behaves like 1/1 + e  x,
but the integral converges. therefore, we can expand in powers of (x2  2e
e2) and consider only the singular terms. we nd
(x2  2e  e2)2# + f inite.
x3 = z 1+e
(b.35)
the nite piece is nite both in the d  0 and e  0 limits. we nd that

x3 =

and so the singular term of order d1 cancels. again, the piece nite in d is
of order e3/2. after taking the d  0 limit, we combine the nite piece in
x3 with the nite piece in x1 and expand in powers of e, to nd

x1 + x3 = 

1

2e3/2

thus the imaginary part of i behaves like

im(i)  

1

a(  1)3/2 .

(b.37)

(b.38)

we also note that the imaginary part is negative for   1+. this was
also the case in the   1 limit. thus we expect the imaginary part to be
increasing negatively as   1.
finally, let us analyze the case when   1. in this case b2 is negative
and does not contribute to the imaginary part. we have to extract the
imaginary part from the following expression
