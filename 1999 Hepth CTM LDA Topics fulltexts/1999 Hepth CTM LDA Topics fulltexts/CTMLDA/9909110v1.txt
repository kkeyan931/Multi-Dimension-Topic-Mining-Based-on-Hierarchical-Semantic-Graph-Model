a double scaling limit can be dened in string theory on a calabi-yau (cy) manifold by

approaching a point in moduli space where the cy space develops an isolated singularity

and at the same time taking the string coupling to zero, while keeping a particular com-

bination of the two parameters xed. this leads to a decoupled theory without gravity

which has a weak coupling expansion, and can be studied using a holographically dual

non-critical superstring description. the usual little string theory corresponds to the

strong coupling limit of this theory. we use holography to compute two and three point

functions in weakly coupled double scaled little string theory, and study the spectrum of

the theory in various dimensions. we nd a discrete spectrum of masses which exhibits

hagedorn growth.

1. the double scaling limit

in the last few years it became clear that consistency of string theory implies the

existence of new non-local theories without gravity in six or less dimensions. one way

of dening these little string theories (lsts) is to consider string dynamics in vacua
which contain n s5-branes, in the decoupling limit gs  0 [1]. in this limit, uctuations
in the bulk of spacetime decouple, and one is left with the dynamics of modes which live

on the vebranes. for example, taking this limit in type iia or iib string theory in at

spacetime with n vebranes leads to maximally supersymmetric six dimensional theories

(sixteen supercharges) with (2, 0) or (1, 1) supersymmetry, respectively.

lsts do not contain gravity but have other features that are reminiscent of critical

string theories. in particular, they have a hagedorn density of states, and upon compact-

ication on tori they exhibit t-duality. there are some apparent dierences as well:

(1) unlike critical strings, for which it is believed that one can only study on-shell physics

(e.g. the s-matrix), lsts are expected to have well dened o-shell greens functions.

(2) critical string theory in at non-compact spacetime has a fundamental scale, the

string scale ls, and a dimensionless coupling, gs. for small gs, the theory is weakly
coupled. lsts, as dened above, have a scale ls, and are further labeled by the
number of vebranes n . they appear to be inherently strongly coupled. one might

be tempted to associate 1/n with a coupling in lst, but there is no known sense in

which the theory becomes weakly coupled at large n (it does become weakly coupled

at large n for suciently low energies). nevertheless, we will see that one can in fact

dene lsts which are arbitrarily weakly coupled, so in this respect lst is actually

similar to critical string theory.

another denition of lst, which will be more useful for our purposes, involves the study
of string vacua of the form ird1,1  m, where m is a cy manifold with an isolated
singularity, in the decoupling limit gs  0. since in this limit all non-trivial physics is
localized near the singularity, to study the resulting lst one can replace the cy manifold
m by its form near the singular point.

in the maximally supersymmetric, six dimensional case of [1], m = k3 and the
possible singularities have an ade classication. the theory on n n s5-branes mentioned

above corresponds to an an1 singularity, near which the k3 manifold looks like an ale
space  the singular, non-compact hypersurface

(1.1)

in c3. the two descriptions of six dimensional lst given above are related by t-duality
[2,3]. the theory on n type iia n s5-branes is equivalent to the iib theory on ir5,1 times

the ale space (1.1), and vice versa.

an interesting generalization of the above procedure is the following. let t be one of

the moduli of k3 cft, and t = tc be the value of t for which the k3 surface develops an
isolated singularity. the standard lst limit is t  tc, followed by gs  0. instead, one
can consider a double scaling limit, i.e. take t  tc and gs  0 at the same time, keeping
some combination, (t  tc)/gs, xed.

to describe this limit more precisely it is convenient to blow up the vicinity of the

singularity and replace the k3 surface by the ale space (1.1) describing the region near

the singularity (at za = 0). one way of smoothing the singularity is to replace (1.1) by

1 + z2
zn

2 + z2

3 =  ,

(1.2)

where  can be thought of as one of the moduli of the underlying k3 cft (  t  tc in
the previous notation). as we will see later, string theory on ir5,1 times the surface (1.2)
depends on , gs only through the scaling parameter x  
corresponds to   0, gs  0 with x held xed. note that:
(1) the string coupling expansion corresponds in this case to an expansion in powers of

n /gs. the double scaling limit

1

1/x.

(2) the original denition of lst corresponds to x = 0 (  0 rst, then gs  0), and

hence gives rise to a strongly coupled theory.

(3) while in string theory on k3 one actually has to take the double scaling limit to

decouple the lst from gravity and bulk string theory, replacing the k3 surface by

(1.2) automatically implements the limit. in particular,  does not have to be small

in (1.2); in fact, the lst becomes weakly coupled at large .

(4) as emphasized in [4], the double scaling limit dened above is qualitatively very similar

to the one used in the study of two dimensional critical string theory [5], and one can

borrow much of the intuition developed there.

(5) string theory on resolved ale spaces was considered in some very interesting pre-

holography papers [6,2]. we will comment later on the relation of these papers to our

work.

the deformation (1.2) has a natural interpretation in terms of the theory of n n s5-
branes1. rewriting (1.2) as

3 = 0;  = (r0)n

(1.3)

and performing the t-duality of [2,3], we nd a system of n vebranes distributed uni-

formly on a circle of radius r0, which is related to  as in (1.3). in type iib string theory,
the low energy theory on n n s5-branes is su (n ) sym theory with sixteen supercharges,

and (1.3) corresponds to a point in the moduli space of vacua of the gauge theory, in which

a complex scalar eld  in the adjoint representation of the gauge group has a v.e.v.

hi = cdiag(e

2i

n , e

4i

n ,    , e

2in

n ) .

(1.4)

the double scaling limit , gs  0 with x = 
n /gs xed has a nice interpretation in this
language. at the point (1.4) in moduli space, the su (n ) gauge symmetry is broken to
u (1)n1, and the mass of the o-diagonal gluons (w-bosons) is mw  r0/gsls  x/ls
(since w-bosons correspond to d1-branes stretched between the vebranes).

1

thus, the double scaling limit is simply the decoupling limit of [1] with xed w-boson

masses. the scaling parameter x is the scale of these masses (in string units). the double

scaled theory is weakly coupled for energies well below mw . for e >> mw one expects to
recover the strongly coupled lst at the origin [1]. a similar story (with slightly dierent

details) can be told for type iia vebranes.

the above discussion can be generalized to higher dimensional calabi-yau spaces.

one again studies the limit where the cy manifold develops an isolated singularity and

blows up the region near the singularity to dene the double scaling limit. there are many

possible singularities that can appear on cy manifolds. we will restrict our attention

to quasi-homogenous hypersurface singularities, in which the vicinity of the singularity is
(as in (1.1)) a hypersurface f (z1,    , zn+1) = 0 in cn+1, where f is a quasi-homogenous
polynomial with weight one under za  raza, i.e.

f (raza) = f (za) ,   c ,

(1.5)

for some set of positive weights ra. the fact that the singularity is isolated implies that f is
transverse, i.e. the only point at which all derivatives za f vanish is the origin, za = 0. the

double scaling limit gives rise in this case to a d = 10  2n dimensional non-gravitational
theory. it involves string theory on ird1,1 times the non-compact manifold

f (z1,    , zn+1) =  .

(1.8)

we will restrict to r > 0. the resulting lst is weakly coupled for large x and we will
study it in this limit.

2. the holographic description

the construction described in the previous section is useful for establishing the ex-

istence of lsts, but it does not provide ecient techniques for studying them in detail.

to go further, we will use a holographic description of these theories. this description,

which is a generalization of the ads/cft correspondence [7], was proposed in [8] (see also

[9,10,11,12,13,14]) and was generalized to the case of general hypersurface singularities

(1.6) in [4]. we will next briey summarize it.

the claim is that holography relates the decoupled dynamics at the singular point
za = 0 in string theory on ird1,1 times the space f (za) = 0 (1.5) (the boundary theory)
to a bulk theory, string theory on

ird1,1  ir  s1  lg(w = f ) ,

where ir is the real line, labeled by , along which the dilaton varies linearly,

 = 

q
2

 ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

and lg(w = f ) is a landau-ginzburg n = 2 scft of n + 1 chiral superelds za with
superpotential w (za) = f (za) (1.5).
it is easy to check [4] that consistency of string
propagation on (2.1) requires a relation between r (1.8) and q (2.2):

q2 = 2r .

4

(2.3)

we will label the s1 in (2.1) by y ; its radius is determined by the gso projection to be q.
the gso projection further acts as an orbifold by a shift along the circle, y  y + q,
and (roughly) as fermion number on the rest of the theory (see [4] for the details).

for the six dimensional, maximally supersymmetric case (1.2), the superpotential is

1 + z2

2 + z2

w = zn
3, and the lg model is an n = 2 minimal model, which can be thought
of as the coset scft su(2)n
u(1)  s1,
u(1)
turning it into su (2)n . the backgound (2.1) thus becomes ir5,1 ir su (2), recovering
the results of [15].

. the gso projection acts as a zn orbifold on su(2)n

the theory described by (2.1) is singular. the string coupling gs  exp(q/2) blows
up as   ; the theory runs to strong coupling. this is not surprising in view of the
earlier discussion, since (2.1) is dual to the singular background (1.6) with  = 0, or (1.7)

x = 0, which as we mentioned is strongly coupled. one would like to turn on  in (1.6)

and study the dual theory for large x, where it is weakly coupled. turning on  in (1.6)

corresponds [16,4] in the dual theory (2.1) to adding to the worldsheet lagrangian the

superpotential term

l = z d2e 1

q (+iy ) + c.c. .

(2.4)

here , y are worldsheet superelds whose bosonic components are the scalar elds , y

discussed above. a few comments about the interaction (2.4) are in order:

(1) this is the n = 2 liouville interaction. it preserves worldsheet n = 2 superconformal

symmetry and hence spacetime supersymmetry. at the same time it prevents the

dilaton from running to strong coupling.

(2) even before we add (2.4) to the lagrangian, the fact that this operator is in the

spectrum of the theory implies that the radius of y is an integer multiple of q. an

analysis of the rest of the spectrum shows [4] that this radius is equal to q.

(3) we can now derive (1.7). standard scaling arguments (see e.g. [5]) imply that the

perturbative expansion in the vacuum (2.1), (2.2), (2.4) is a series in gs/

(2.3), this leads to (1.7).

2 . using

it is interesting to compare our discussion to the work of [6,2]. in these papers it was

pointed out that the sigma-model whose target space is the non-compact manifold (1.6)

can be alternatively described by a landau-ginzburg model with superpotential

w = zk

0 + f (z1,    , zn+1) ,

(2.5)

5

where z0 is an additional chiral supereld, and

k  1/r .

(2.6)

the description (2.5) is natural since the equation w (z0, za) = 0 in n + 1 dimensional
weighted projective space satises the cy condition with c = n, and if z0 6= 0 we can set it
to one and recover the space (1.6). it was also argued in [6,2] that the patch with z0 = 0

should not appear since in the lg phase the superpotential (2.5) pushes z0 to large values.

the rst term in the superpotential (2.5) appears to be ill dened: the corresponding

potential does not have a minimum at a nite value of z0, and in general k is non-integer,

which makes w non single valued. in [6,2] it was proposed to interpret it as an sl(2)/u (1)

coset scft at level k, and arguments were presented to support this interpretation. geo-

metrically, this coset corresponds to a semi-innite cigar [17], with the string coupling going
to zero far from the tip and approaching an arbitrary nite value at the tip (gs  1/k).
comparing (2.1), (2.4) with (2.5) we see that our description of (1.6) is very similar,

but appears to be dierent from that of [6,2]. for  = 0 the two are identical: both contain
a lg model with superpotential w = f , and an innite cylinder ir  s1 with a linear
dilaton along ir. when  is turned on, the two descriptions naively disagree. in our case,
the strong coupling singularity at    is cut o by a superpotential (2.4), whereas in
[6,2] it is eliminated by changing the topology of the cylinder to that of the semi-innite

cigar.

since both descriptions are quite well motivated, we would like to propose that they

are in fact equivalent, i.e. that n = 2 liouville (with a cosmological constant ) and
sl(2)/u (1) (with e   1
related by strong-weak coupling duality on the worldsheet (possibly, a kind of t-duality).

k at the tip of the cigar) are isomorphic scfts. they are

we have not proven this statement but would like to oer the following comments in its

support:

(1) the matching of the central charges of the two theories relates the slope of the linear

dilaton q (2.2) to the level k of sl(2)/u (1). the relation, which follows from (2.3),
(2.6), is q2 = 2/k. thus, if the two are equivalent, the relation between them is

indeed a strong-weak coupling duality. n = 2 liouville is weakly coupled for large

liouville central charge, i.e. large q, while sl(2)/u (1) is weakly coupled for large k

(when the curvature of the cigar goes to zero everywhere).

6

(2) recall that the radius of the s1 (labeled by y ) in n = 2 liouville is q. the asymptotic
radius of the euclidean cigar is 2k [17]. the two are indeed inverses of each other,
ry = 2/rcigar, as appropriate for t-dual theories.

(3) in n = 2 liouville, the cosmological term breaks translation invariance in y .

in

contrast, in sl(2)/u (1) translation invariance around the cigar is not broken, but

winding number is not a good symmetry, since winding modes around the cigar can

move to the tip and contract to a point. this again is consistent with an interpretation

of the relation between the two theories as t-duality, which exchanges winding and
momentum modes. in both theories, as   0 the respective symmetries are restored.
(4) a closely related duality to the one advocated here appeared in unpublished work by

v. a. fateev, a. b. zamolodchikov and al. b. zamolodchikov. it relates the bosonic
sl(2)/u (1) cft to a bosonic analog of our ir  s1 with the superpotential (2.4)
replaced by a bosonic potential of the form e cos(y ).

finally, we should remark on the possible relation of the duality proposed above to the

standard t-duality with respect to the abelian isometry of the cigar cft [18]. the latter

takes the cigar into a trumpet, which seems dierent from the n = 2 liouville background

at small . however, it might be that non-perturbative worldsheet eects modify the

trumpet background. the abelian t-duality of an ale space, mentioned previously, is

an example where the naive dual background is expected to receive worldsheet instanton

corrections which modify it to the n s5-brane background (more generally, the abelian

dual of a kaluza-klein monopole is expected to receive worldsheet instanton corrections

which modify it to an h-monopole [19]).

3. correlation functions and spectrum

in this section we will use the holographic description of [8,4] to compute correlation

functions in weakly coupled double scaled little string theory. recall that, in general, holog-

raphy relates observables in the non-gravitational boundary theory to non-normalizable

on-shell states in the bulk theory. a large class of such observables corresponds to non-

normalizable vertex operators (i.e. fundamental string states) in the bulk theory, and we

will focus on those here.

to get started, we need to decide which of the two t-dual descriptions of the bulk

theory to use, the sl(2)/u (1) or n = 2 liouville one. as explained in section 2, the two are

supposed to be equivalent, but each is more appropriate in a dierent region of parameter

7

space. for large k it is better to use sl(2)/u (1), while for small k the n = 2 liouville

description provides a better qualitative guide to the physics. the transition between the
two descriptions occurs at k = 1 (corresponding to the self dual radius ry = rcigar = 2).
in our context, k lies in the range2 1/2  k < . for example, in the maximally
supersymmetric six dimensional case we have k = n , the number of vebranes, and it can

become arbitrarily large, but is bounded from below by two. therefore, it is natural to use

the sl(2)/u (1) variables to describe the observables and compute correlation functions.

we next recall a few facts about sl(2)/u (1) cft.

3.1. sl(2)/u (1) cft

a convenient description of the sl(2)/u (1) coset cft is obtained by starting with
sl(2) u (1) and gauging the null diagonal u (1) obtained from j 3 of sl(2) and the extra
u (1) (and similarly for the other worldsheet chirality). realizing the extra u (1) in terms

of a canonically normalized free scalar eld y , we gauge the axial symmetry

(j 3  ir k

2

y,  j 3  ir k

2

 y ) ,

(3.1)

which leads to the cigar geometry. observables in the coset theory are obtained from
observables in sl(2)  u (1) cft by imposing invariance under (3.1) (and identifying
gauge equivalent observables). thus, one can use results about correlation functions in

sl(2) cft to study the coset.

observables in sl(2) cft3 (see e.g. [20] for a recent discussion) are obtained by
3 and then applying to them the generators of the

studying functions on the manifold h +
current algebra. a convenient basis for such functions is

j(x, x) =

2j + 1

 (cid:18)

(  x)(  x)e + e(cid:19)2(j+1)

(3.2)

where (, , ) are coordinates on h +
auxiliary variables introduced in [21]. in the quantum cft on h +
of the full sl(2)  sl(2) current algebra; their scaling dimensions are

3 (the metric is 1

k ds2 = d2 + e2dd) and (x, x) are
3 , the j are primaries

j = j = 

j(j + 1)
k  2

.

(3.3)

2 the lower bound corresponds to pure n = 2 liouville or superconformal sl(2)/u (1), where

c = 3 + 6/k = 15  k = 1/2.

3 more precisely, we will be discussing the euclidean analog of the sl(2) group manifold,
3 = sl(2,c)/su (2).

discussion),

for studying the coset it is convenient to fourier transform the elds j(x, x) and dene
the mode operators

and similarly for j a(z).

radius of y is 2k [17]:

m =

(n1 + n2k); m = 

1
2

(n1  n2k) .

(3.9)

one can think of n1 as the momentum around the cigar (which is conserved) and n2 as
the winding (which is not).

not all values of j are allowed in this theory. non-normalizable vertex operators
vj;m, m correspond to real j > 1/2. furthermore, unitarity implies that only operators
with j < (k  2)/2 are kept [22]. unitarity also implies that all scaling dimensions of

9

virasoro primaries in the cft should be positive (except for the identity); in particular,
(3.8) must satisfy j;m, m, j;m, m > 0.

at large positive  the form of the observables (3.7) simplies. using (3.4), (3.5),

(3.7) we nd that

vj;m, m  e2jj+mj+ mei 2

k (my  m y ) .

(3.10)

as explained in [23], in this region the theory simplies and the target space can be thought
of as a cylinder, ir s1, labeled by  and y . the powers of ,  in (3.10) can be dropped
and vj;m, m go over to the standard observables in a linear dilaton vacuum.

we will be interested below in a supersymmetric version of the above coset cft. this

leads to a few small modications in the analysis. if we denote by k the total level of the
sl(2) current algebra on h +
3 , then the level of the bosonic part of the algebra is k + 2
(with the fermions contributing 2 units). thus, the scaling dimension of the primaries
j (3.2) is shifted by k  k + 2 and the unitarity bound of [22] becomes

j <

k
2

.

(3.11)

since the u (1) current j 3 that we are modding out by still has level k, formulae like (3.1)

remain unchanged. thus, in the superconformal coset sl(2)/u (1) we have observables

vj;m, m given by (3.7) (with m, m satisfying (3.9)) whose scaling dimensions are

j;m, m =

m2  j(j + 1)

k

; j;m, m =

m2  j(j + 1)

k

.

positivity of the scaling dimensions (3.12) implies in this case the constraint

m2, m2 > j(j + 1) .

(3.14)

where c(j; k) is a numerical factor which can be found in [24]. since we will be primarily

interested in the analytic structure of the two point function, it is sucient to note that

c(j; k) does not have poles or zeroes for nite j and k > 1. we have written (3.14) in a no-

tation suited for application to the supersymmetric case, i.e. the level of the bosonic dsl(2)

10

implied in (3.14) is k + 2. the two point function (3.14) does not have any singularities

for all j satisfying the inequality

< j <

k  1

2

.

(3.15)

as j approaches the lower bound in (3.15), the two point function goes to zero, while when

it approaches the upper bound it diverges.

clearly, for physical applications (e.g. for string theory on ads3) both types of singu-
larities are undesirable. for example, outside of the range (3.15) states in the spacetime

cft of string theory on ads3 have negative norm. fortunately, the lower bound in (3.15)
is precisely the condition for non-normalizability of the vertex operators discussed above,

while the upper bound almost coincides with the unitarity constraint (3.11). in fact, (3.15)

is slightly stronger. note that this is not in contradiction with [22]. in these papers it is

assumed that the current algebra primary state has positive norm, and one asks whether

there are any negative norm states in the current algebra block obtained by acting on the
primary with creation operators j a

n (after modding out u (1)). the two point function
(3.14) instead probes the question whether the norm of the primaries changes sign as one

varies j. thus, below we will impose (3.15) on the observables.

using (3.14) one can now compute the two point functions of observables in the coset

theory (3.7). the rst step is to transform from the local elds j(x, x) (3.2) to the
modes (3.5). to simplify the formulae and anticipating the application to non-critical

superstrings, we will set m = m, i.e. restrict to pure winding modes around the cigar

(3.9). one nds

(here and below we supress the z dependence).

to compute the two point function of coset observables vj;m,m (3.7) we multiply (3.16)
by the two point function of the exponential in y . this does not change the result; hence

3.2. two point functions in double scaled lst

to use the results of the previous subsection for calculating two point functions in

double scaled little string theory we have to construct brst invariant observables in

string theory on

sl(2)k
u (1)  ird1,1  lg(w = f ) .

(3.18)

the analysis is very similar to that of [4,16]. we will focus on (ns,ns) sector elds,

since the rest of the observables can be obtained from these by applying the spacetime

supercharges.

the lowest lying states are the tachyons, described by the (1, 1) picture vertex

operators

(3.19)
where k ( = 0, 1,    , d  1) is the momentum along ird1,1 and ,  are the left and
right moving bosonized superghost elds. the mass-shell condition and gso projection

vj;m,m ,

t (k) = e eikx

lead to the following physical state constraints:

kk +

m2  j(j + 1)

k

=

1
2

,

1
2
m 

k
2

(2z + 1) .

(3.20)

comparing to (3.9) we see that gso projects out the momentum modes around the cigar

and keeps half of the winding modes (for generic k) as mentioned earlier.

another set of observables corresponds to gravitons, whose (1, 1) picture vertex

operators have the form

e   eikx

vj;m,m ,

(3.21)

where  are the worldsheet fermions on ird1,1,  is the polarization tensor, and the
physical state constraints are

m2  j(j + 1)

k

= 0 ,

kk +

1
2
m  kz .

(3.22)

there are also transversality conditions on  which we will not specify.

the most general (ns,ns) sector observable is a linear combination of vertex operators

of the following form:

e pnl,nr(x, , ) p nl, nr

(a, a, j a, j a)vlgeikx

vj;m,m ,

(3.23)

12

where pnl,nr is a polynomail in x, 2x,   , x, 2x,   , ,  and their derivatives;
nl and nr are its total left and right-moving scaling dimensions, respectively. similarly,
is a polynomial in j a, j a, their worldsheet superpartners a, a and their
p nl, nr
derivatives, with total scaling dimensions ( nl, nr). vlg is a vertex operator from the
lg(w = f ) sector of (3.18). brst invariance and the gso projection require (3.23) to

be a bottom component of a worldsheet n = 1 supereld, and in addition to satisfy

1
2

kk +

+ nl + nl + lg =

1
2

,

(3.24)

m2  j(j + 1)
2m
k

+ fl  2z + 1 ,

k

qlg +

where lg and qlg are the left-moving scaling dimension and u (1)r charge of vlg,

respectively, and fl is the left-moving fermion number of (3.23) (similar relations hold for

the right-movers). moreover, the operator (3.23) must be invariant under the symmetry

(3.1). note also that 2m/k is not in general integer, unlike (3.9) with m = m. the reason

for that is that the gso projection acts as an orbifold on sl(2)/u (1) (see [4]), coupling

it to the rest of the background (3.18).

we are now ready to compute correlation functions of the observables (3.19), (3.21),

(3.23). recall that correlation functions of non-normalizable on-shell vertex operators in

the bulk theory are interpreted in the boundary theory as o-shell greens functions [7,8].

thus, their analytic structure provides information about the spectrum and interactions

of the boundary theory. the analytic structure of the two point function, for example,

contains information about the spectrum of the boundary theory. we will next study it in

our case.

for the general vertex operator (3.23), the only non-trivial part of the two point
function is the worldsheet correlation function hvj;m,mvj;m,mi. this is the only source
of singularities of the amplitude, and thus we will focus on it. as a rst example, consider

the two point function of the tachyon eld (3.19),

ht (k)t (k)i = c(j; k)

(1  2j+1
( 2j+1

k )(1 + j + m)(j  m + 1)(2j  1)

k )(j  m)(m  j)(2j + 2)

,

(3.25)

where j, m satisfy the constraints (3.13), (3.15), (3.20). note that the (j  j) from (3.17)
has disappeared; it cancelled against a zero mode of the ghosts which normally would make

the two point function vanish in string theory.

13

the two point function (3.25) has a series of poles, which we interpret as contributions

of on-shell states in lst which are created from the vacuum by the operator t (k). we
next analyze these poles.

one series of poles corresponds to

m = j + n; n = 1, 2, 3,   

(3.26)

it is easy to check that these are single poles. the residues of the poles all have the

same sign, in agreement with the expected unitarity of lst. the corresponding masses of

excitations are determined by the rst line in (3.20):

m 2

n = kk = 1 +

2

k (cid:0)j(2n  1) + n2(cid:1) .

(3.27)

for the smallest posssible value of m, m = k/2 (recall the second line in (3.20) and (3.26)),
we nd (using (3.15)) states with n = 1, 2,    , [k/2], with masses

m 2

n =

2
k

(n  1)(k  n) .

(3.28)

the lowest lying state is massless; it is followed by a nite series of excited states. more

generally, we have

m =

k
2

l,

l = 1, 3, 5, 7,   

m 2

n,l = l  1 +

2
k

(n  1)(kl  n) ,

kl + 1 > 2n > k(l  1) + 1 .

(3.29)

the range of n is obtained from (3.15). note that lorentz invariance of the lst implies

that all the states that can be created from the vacuum by the tachyon eld t (k) (and
whose masses are given by (3.29)) have spin zero.

the poles of (3.25) which are related to (3.26) by m  m are not independent of
those discussed above. all other poles violate one or more of the bounds4 (3.13), (3.15).

the massless state corresponding to n = l = 1 in (3.29) has a natural interpretation in

the vebrane theory. we will describe it in the six dimensional maximally supersymmetric

4 note, for example, that if we imposed the constraint (3.11) rather than (3.15), we would be
lead to the rather unpleasant prediction that lst has tachyons. the pole of (3.25) at m = k/2,
j = (k  1)/2 leads (3.20) to m 2 = 1 + 1
2k , which is in general negative. furthermore, if k is

integer (3.25) has a double pole at that value of j, which seems dicult to interpret in lst.

14

case, but the discussion can probably be extended to general singularities (1.6). as we saw

in section 1, six dimensional double scaled type iib lst describes the dynamics of n = k

vebranes at the point (1.4) in the coulomb branch. due to the higgs mechanism, the only
massless states one expects to nd in this theory are n  1 supermultiplets corresponding
to the cartan subalgebra of su (n ). the massless state with n = 1 in (3.28) belongs to
one of these n  1 supermultiplets5.

it is not dicult to exhibit the other n  2 massless multiplets. for this, we need to
examine the two point functions of tachyons (3.19) which have a non-trivial wave function

in the minimal model denoted by lg(w = f ) in (3.18). in our case the superpotential is

(1.1)

w = zn

1 + z2

2 + z2
3 ,

(3.30)

corresponding to an n = 2 minimal model. the chiral worldsheet operators can be written
as zi

1, with i = 0, 1,    , n  2. a natural generalization of the tachyon vertex (3.19) is

ti(k) = e eikx

zi
1vj;m,m ,

where

(3.31)

(3.32)

which is simply (3.24) for this particular case. the tachyon t (k) (3.19) is in fact t0(k).
the two point function of ti is proportional to that of t0, (3.25), and has poles giving
rise to a spectrum similar to (3.29). it is easy to check that there is a physical pole at
m = kl/2, l = 1  i
n , m = j + 1, which gives rise to a massless state in six dimensional
lst. there are thus precisely n  1 massless states, corresponding to i = 0,    , n  2, in
agreement with the above expectations from su (n ) gauge theory.

moving on to the two point function of the graviton, we see that in this case m = kl/2
with l  2z. the two point function again has poles for j satisfying (3.26), which using
(3.22) corresponds to the mass spectrum

m 2

n,l = l +

(n  1)(kl  n) ,

2
k
l = 2, 4, 6,   
kl + 1 > 2n > k(l  1) + 1 .

(3.33)

5 it is sucient to exhibit any one of the members of the supermultiplet, since the supersymme-
try structure, worked out in [4], then guarantees the appearance of the rest of the supermultiplet,
with the right quantum numbers.

15

all the states that the bulk graviton (3.21) couples to are massive6. this is consistent
with the fact that the boundary theory is not a theory of gravity  the spectrum does not

contain a massless spin two particle.

consider, nally, the two point function of the most general on-shell vertex operator
(3.23). let n  nl + nl + lg be the total excitation level corresponding to this
vertex operator. as before, the poles correspond to (3.26), which in this case leads to the

spectrum

m 2

n,l = 2n + l  1 +

2
k

(n  1)(kl  n) ,

kl + 1 > 2n > k(l  1) + 1 ,

(3.34)

where l is dened as in the rst line of (3.29), m = kl/2. it runs over the range implied
by the second line in (3.24), l  qlg  fl + 2z + 1, subject to the constraint (3.13).

3.3. three point functions

three point couplings between the states (3.34) can be obtained from the three point

function in the usual way (by taking the external legs on-shell and computing the residue

of the resulting poles). to nd the three point functions in the double scaled lst one

follows the same steps as in the computation of the two point functions. we will only

present the procedure schematically, leaving the details for future work. first, one needs
the three point functions of the sl(2) primaries (3.2) in the h +
3 cft. those are given in
[24]:

hj1(x1, x1)j2(x2, x2)j3 (x3, x3)i = d(j1, j2, j3; k)c(j1, j2, j3; x1, x2, x3) ,

(3.35)

where

c(j1, j2, j3; x1, x2, x3) = |x1  x2|2(j3j1j21)|x1  x3|2(j2j1j31)|x2  x3|2(j1j2j31) .
(3.36)

d(j1, j2, j3; k) does not depend on x, and its explicit form is given in [24]. to compute
the three point functions in the coset theory we need to transform the elds ji(xi, xi),
i = 1, 2, 3, to the modes (3.5); this leads to hypergeometric functions depending on ji, mi.
finally, the three point functions in the spacetime theory are obtained by following the

same steps as in subsection 3.2.

6 the two point function of the graviton provides an example of the importance of the con-
ignoring it, one nds a series of poles of (3.17) at m = 0, j = (n  1)/2,

straint (3.13).

n = 2, 4, 6,   , which, if present, would correspond to tachyons in lst with masses which can be
read o (3.22), m 2 = 2j(j + 1)/k.

16

4. discussion

by dening little string theory in a double scaling limit (see section 2), we were

able to study the theory at weak coupling, 1/x (1.7). we used this description to compute

correlation functions in the theory to leading order in 1/x.

one of the main results of this paper is the calculation of the two point functions of

observables in double scaled lst ((3.25) and its generalization to other vertex operators),

and the corresponding spectrum of masses (3.34).

the two point functions we computed have a relatively simple analytic structure. they

exhibit a series of single poles which we interpreted as arising from single particle states
in lst, created from the vacuum by applying dierent operators7. this might come as a

surprise, since in general one would expect two point functions in a non-trivial theory such

as lst to be complicated functions of the momenta. the eigenstates of the hamiltonian

need not be interpretable in terms of free particles, and one would expect a complicated

structure containing resonances, thresholds (branch cuts) and brown muck.

of course, crucial to the simplicity of the two point functions is the fact that the

theory is weakly coupled. as mentioned above, we only computed the two point function

to leading order in 1/x, and it is reasonable to expect the theory to be free in this limit.

a good analogy is conning su (n ) gauge theory in four dimensions. for nite n the

spectrum of the theory is complicated and, correspondingly, the two point functions of

gauge invariant observables are expected to have a complicated analytic structure. as
n   the theory simplies and becomes essentially a free eld theory of the bound
states (glueballs). the two point functions of observables like trf f  are expected to
simplify in the limit and have an analytic structure similar to the one found here.

another interesting fact about the two point functions is that while the full spectrum

of masses we nd is rather rich, most operators do not couple to most of the states!

there are two aspects to this, one that seems natural, and a second one that looks more

surprising.

the natural one is the following. even if the spectrum of lst at large x consists of free

particles with the masses (3.34), one would in general expect that in the absence of special

symmetries, generic observables can create from the vacuum both single and multi-particle

states. the latter would contribute branch cuts in the two point functions. the fact that

7 as we pointed out, a nice consistency check is that the residues of all poles in the two point

functions have the same sign, which is necessary for unitarity of lst.

17

we only nd poles means that the observables that we study, on-shell vertex operators in

the bulk theory, only couple to single particle states in lst. this seems natural, since

they are single string states in the bulk, and we are performing an expansion in gs. in the

gauge theory analogy mentioned above, fundamental string vertex operators are analogs

of single trace operators in large n yang-mills theory.

more surprisingly, we nd that even within the set of single particle operators/states,

most operators do not couple to most states. the tachyon operators t (k) (3.19) only

couple to states (3.34) with n = 0, the gravitons (3.21) couple to states with n = 1/2,

etc. this is not expected to happen in general. e.g. in the large n gauge theory example

the spectrum is believed to exhibit hagedorn growth, and one expects that all single trace

operators have a non-zero overlap with all states which have the same quantum numbers
(e.g. the same spin). for example, the operator trf f  mentioned above, should be
able to create from the vacuum all states with spin zero.

the fact that in lst we nd an innite number of additional selection rules suggests

that the weakly coupled theory has a very large symmetry group.

it would be nice to

understand it better.

it is natural to suggest that in lst there is a state-operator correspondence, namely,

that each operator in the bulk can create a particular one particle state in the boundary

theory. for example, a tachyon vertex operator (3.19) with given n, l (or j, m) can create

from the vacuum a unique state, with mass given by (3.29). if this proposal is correct, it is

easy to compute the degeneracy of states with any mass (3.34). since the mass spectrum

(3.34) is very similar to that of the bulk theory, and the state-operator correspondence

suggests that the degeneracies are the same as well, one nds a hagedorn density of states

(e)  eh e ,

(4.1)

where h , the inverse hagedorn temperature, is the same as that of the bulk theory. we

emphasize that this last conclusion assumes the state-operator correspondence, and should

be examined more carefully.

note that all the poles of the two point functions that give rise to the masses (3.34)

occur for values of (j, m) that satisfy (3.26) (or, equivalently, its mirror image related by
m  m). algebraically, these are values for which the underlying sl(2) representations
are one sided. they contain a state, m = j+1, which is annihilated by j  (or m = (j+1),
annihilated by j +). these representations are sometimes refered to as the principal discrete

18

series. a natural question is why does the principal discrete series play a special role in

the analysis, and how one can think of the resulting spectrum of the lst.

we would like to make two comments regarding these issues. the rst is that the

appearance of the principal discrete series is not particularly surprising if we compare to

the better understood case of string theory on ads3 [7,25]. in that case, the holograph-

ically dual spacetime theory is a two dimensional cft and the operators j(x, x) (3.2)

correspond to local operators in this theory.

while there are well known subtleties [26,24] with the state-operator correspondence

in cft on ads3, the spacetime cft is a more or less conventional unitary cft, and

in particular it does have a state-operator correspondence. the state corresponding to

a given operator v j(x, x) (v is a vertex operator which depends on the rest of the

string background; see [25] for the details) is obtained by acting with v j(x, x) on the

in radial quantization the in vacuum corresponds to x = 0, hence incoming

vacuum.
states correspond to limx0 v j(x, x)|0i.

expanding j(x, x) in modes, as in (3.5), we see that the mode that creates the above
state in the spacetime cft has m = m = j  1. modes with larger m must kill the
vacuum, while those with smaller m do not contribute in the limit x  0. similarly, there
n1
are states created by acting on the vacuum with n1
x j(x, x). the modes that create
these states have m = j  n. the modes (3.26) discussed in section 3 are related to them
by m  m; they create states when acting on the out vacuum at x  .

x

thus, at least in string theory on ads3 the modes (3.26) corresponding to the principal

discrete series certainly do create physical states in the spacetime theory. it is perhaps not

surprising that something very similar seems to be going on in the sl(2)/u (1) case.

the second comment concerns the physical interpretation of the spectrum (3.34). it

is known [27] that the dynamics of winding modes on the cigar sl(2)/u (1) is equivalent

by t-duality to the motion of a particle in a potential which is attractive for small 

and goes to a constant at large . the spectrum contains bound states corresponding

to the principal discrete series, and a continuum above a gap, which corresponds to the
normalizable states with j =  1
2 + i. the discrete states can presumably be thought of
in the original variables as some sort of bound states whose wave function is supported
near the tip of the cigar. the states with j =  1
2 + i make wave packets that can live
arbitrarily far from the tip of the cigar and have an arbitrary momentum  (hence the

continuum). it is easy to verify using (3.24), (3.34) that the continuum starts right above

19

the highest mass discrete state (in a sector with given n , l), as expected from the form of

the potential for the winding modes [27].

one can ask whether the normalizable states with j =  1

2 + i should be included in
the lst. for this to be the case, it seems to us necessary that there are some observables

in the theory which can create these states from the vacuum. the class of observables

analyzed in this paper, the non-normalizable fundamental string operators, does not seem

to couple to these states. if no other observables do either, we would be inclined to believe
that these modes decouple from the lst dynamics8.

returning to the spectrum (4.1), our conclusion that the density of states of the

lst grows exponentially with energy, with the same hagedorn temperature as that of the

bulk theory, seems to be at odds with the discussion of [28] where it was argued that the
hagedorn temperature is in fact lower by (roughly) a factor of k (and thus the density
of states  grows more rapidly with energy than (4.1)). furthermore, it was argued in
[28] that the scale of non-locality in lst is of order ms/k, lower than one would guess
naively, e.g. from the t-duality arguments of [1], and lower than what we nd.

our attitude to this apparent discrepancy is the following. the analysis of [28] applies
in our language to energies e >> mw  x, while we computed the spectrum of excitations
with energies e << mw . we nd a hagedorn growth of the density of states (4.1) with
a smaller h than that of [28] in the range ms << e << mw . it is reasonable to expect
that the density of states with e >> mw is much higher and agrees with [28].

the regime e >> mw is strongly coupled in our description and is dicult to study
directly. as has been learned in many examples in the last few years, typically only states

that are protected by supersymmetry can be reliably counted at strong coupling. perhaps

d-brane states which preserve some of the supersymmetry in the background (3.18) would

resolve the discrepancy (see [29] for a recent discussion).

finally, some of the vacua of lst that our discussion applies to correspond to theories

on vebranes wrapped around riemann surfaces, which are relevant for describing strongly

coupled gauge theories using branes [4]. we hope that our results will help improve this

understanding.

8 this issue is further confused by the fact [24,26] that in correlation functions of non-
normalizable operators in cft on sl(2)/u (1) one is typically instructed to sum over all the

normalizable states in internal channels. nevertheless, it seems that the singularity structure of

the resulting correlation functions can be interpreted purely in terms of states bound to the tip

of the cigar.
