abstract

a sigma model action with n=2 d=6 superspace variables is constructed for the

type ii superstring compactied to six curved dimensions with ramond-ramond ux.

the action can be quantized since the sigma model is linear when the six-dimensional
spacetime is at. when the six-dimensional spacetime is ads3  s3, the action reduces to
one found earlier with vafa and witten.

1. introduction

construction of quantizable superstring actions in adsd  sd backgrounds with
ramond-ramond ux is currently of great interest. although such a construction has not
yet been done for the ads5  s5 case, it has been done for the ads2  s2 and ads3  s3
cases. in the ads2  s2 case [1], this construction was straightforward since a quantizable
sigma model action was already known for the superstring in a general four-dimensional
background [2]. in the ads3  s3 case [3], however, guesswork had to be used since the
action in a general six-dimensional background had not yet been found.

in this paper, a quantizable sigma model action is constructed for the superstring in a

general six-dimensional background. this construction is useful for several reasons. firstly,

it allows quantization of the superstring in six-dimensional curved backgrounds other than
ads3  s3. secondly, it provides a new and simpler description of the ads3  s3 action
which may be useful for the construction of vertex operators. thirdly, it provides clues

which might be useful for quantization of the superstring in a general ten-dimensional

background.

the six-dimensional action in a at background was constructed in [4](and reviewed in

[3]) using worldsheet variables from the hybrid description of the superstring. these hy-

brid variables are related by a eld redenition to the worldsheet variables of the ramond-

neveu-schwarz (rns) formalism and include spacetime spinors as in the green-schwarz

(gs) formalism. the hybrid action has an n=2 worldsheet superconformal invariance

which replaces  symmetry of the gs action and which is related to a twisted n=2 brst

symmetry of the rns formalism [5]. unlike the gs action, quantization is straightforward

since the hybrid action in a at background is quadratic.

in the formalism of [4][3], only half of the sixteen s of n=2 d=6 superspace are

present as fundamental worldsheet elds. although this preserves manifest so(5,1) lorentz

invariance, it breaks half of the manifest d=6 supersymmetries. this fact made it dicult

to generalize the formalism to arbitrary curved six-dimensional backgrounds.

in this paper, this diculty will be overcome by adding eight more s (and their con-

jugate momenta) as fundamental elds in the action, as well as eight rst-class harmonic

constraints [6] [7] which can be used to gauge away these new elds. with these additional

elds and constraints, it will be easy to construct a sigma model action for the superstring

in an arbitrary curved six-dimensional background.

like the gs sigma model action, the hybrid action is dened using superspace variables

which are extremely convenient for describing backgrounds with ramond-ramond ux.

1

however, unlike the gs sigma model action, the hybrid action reduces to a free quadratic

action when the six-dimensional spacetime is at. by using a normal coordinate expansion,

this allows quantization in a curved background. another dierence with the gs action

is that the hybrid action contains a coupling of the spacetime dilaton to the worldsheet

curvature, as expected from the coupling-constant dependence of scattering amplitudes.

in section 2 of this paper, the hybrid action will be reviewed in a at six-dimensional

background.

in section 3, this action will be written in a manifestly n=2 d=6 super-

symmetric form by introducing new  variables and new harmonic constraints [6][7]. in

section 4, the manifestly spacetime-supersymmetric form of the action will be generalized

to a curved six-dimensional background. and in section 5, the action will be shown to
reduce to that of [3] when the six-dimensional background is chosen to be ads3  s3 with
ramond-ramond ux.

2. review of hybrid action in a at six-dimensional background

2.1. action and n=2 constraints

in a at six-dimensional background, the hybrid formalism was developed in reference
[4] and was reviewed in [3]. besides xm for m = 0 to 5, the six-dimensional left-moving
worldsheet elds consist of eight fermions,  and p for  = 1 to 4, and two chiral bosons,
 and . for the closed superstring, the right-moving worldsheet elds consist of   and
p  for  = 1 to 4, and two anti-chiral bosons,  and . for the type iib (or type iia)

superstring, an up  index and up (or down)  index transform as 4 representations of
su(4), and a down  index and down (or up)  transform as 4 representations. in addi-
tion, one has a c = 6 n=2 superconformal eld theory representing the compactication

manifold.

in a at background, the free action is

s = z d2z(

1
2

xm xm + p  + p   ) + sb + sc

(2.1)

where sc is the action for the compactication variables and sb is an action for the chiral

and anti-chiral bosons which we will not write explicitly. one also has the following critical

n=2 superconformal generators:

t =

where [tc, g+
c, jc] are the c = 6 n=2 generators of the superconformal eld the-
ory representing the compactication, (p)4 = 1
24 pppp, xm has been written in
bispinor notation as x = (m)xm, and (m) are the six-dimensional pauli matrices
satisfying

(m)(n) + (n)(m) = 2mn


with (m) dened as (m) = 1
2 (m). as described in [4], these worldsheet
variables can be obtained from the rns worldsheet variables by a eld redenition and

the constraints of (2.2) are related to the stress tensor, brst current, b ghost, and ghost-

number current of the rns formalism.

2.2. massless compactication-independent vertex operators

since the integrated form of the massless vertex operators appear in the sigma model

action, it will be useful to review these operators here, beginning with the simpler case of

open string massless vertex operators.

the massless compactication-independent open string vertex operators are described

by a supereld v (x, ,  + i) which can be expanded as v = pn en(+i)vn(x, ) where

vn(x, ) is an arbitrary function of the zero modes of xm and . the chiral bosons only
appear in the combination  + i in order that v has no poles with j. the integrated

form of the vertex operator is given by

u = z dzgg+v (x, ,  + i)

(2.3)

where gy will always denote the single pole in the ope of g with y . using the fact
that gen(+i) = 0 for n  0, one can show that when v is on-shell,

u = z dz[



6

eipa () + ip () +

i
2

x ()]v1(x, )

(2.4)

z dz



6

p v2(x, )

3

where  = d/d and  = 
m d/dxm. note that the only  + i dependence in
the integrated vertex operator of (2.4) is the ei factor in the rst term. all terms
proportional to en(+i) for n > 0 must vanish on-shell in order that u has no poles with
g.

the closed massless compactication-independent vertex operator is obtained by tak-

ing the square of the open vertex operator, i.e.

u = z dzdz gg g+g+v (x, , ,  + i,  + i)

(2.5)

where v = pn,n en(+i)+n(+i)vn,n(x, , ).

3. hybrid formalism with harmonic constraints

3.1. action and n=2 constraints

since the vertex operator of (2.5) depends only on four s and four s, it is not obvious
how to relate v and u of (2.5) with the standard six-dimensional type ii superelds which
depend on eight s and eight s. as will be explained below, this relation will become
obvious after introducing worldsheet elds for four new s and four new s (and their
conjugate momenta), as well as introducing harmonic constraints which allow half of
the s and s to be gauged away. unlike the other worldsheet variables and the n=2
superconformal constraints, these new fermionic variables and harmonic constraints do not

seem to come from worldsheet variables or constraints in the rns formalism.

the starting point will be a free action containing the new fermionic worldsheet vari-

ables in addition to the variables of (2.1):

s = z d2z(

1
2

xm xm + pj j + p j  j) + sb + sc

(3.1)

where j = 1 to 2 so one has twice as many s and ps. the opes of the free elds in this

action are:

xm(y)xn(z)  mnlog(y  z),

(y)(z)  log(y  z),

(y)(z)  log(y  z), (3.2)

pj(y)k(z)  

k

j (y  z)1.

the action of (3.1) can be written in manifestly n=2 d=6 supersymmetric notation as

s = z d2z(

z zm + bf lat

m n ym yn + dj j + d j  j) + sb + sc

(3.3)

where ... signies terms which vanish using the equations of motion (e.g. terms involving
j or   j). note that the non-linear terms in dj and d j cancel the cubic and quartic
terms in (3.3) coming from m
z zm and from the wess-zumino term. in ten dimensions,
a similar action to (3.3) was constructed by siegel in [8], and in four dimensions, a similar

action was constructed in [2]. the rst two terms of (3.3) is the standard six-dimensional

gs action in a at background.

it is easy to check that the equations of motion imply that dj, m

z , and j are holo-
morphic, commute with the spacetime-supersymmetry generators, and satisfy the opes[8]

dj(y)dk(z)  i(y  z)1jk(m)m

z (y).

dj(y)k(z)  (y  z)2k

j 

, m

z (y)n

z (z)  (y  z)2mn.

to make (3.3) equivalent to the original action of (2.1), one now imposes the following

eight rst-class constraints:

d  d2  eid1 = 0,

d   d 2  ei d 1 = 0.

(3.6)

it is interesting to note that similar constraints were used in [7] to describe the d = 6
superparticle with worldline supersymmetry. since {d, 2} = 
, the rst-class con-
straints of (3.6) can be used to gauge-x 2 =  2 = 0. in this gauge, the action of (3.1)
reduces to the action of (2.1) where 1 is identied with  and p1 is identied with p.

the n=2 superconformal generators for (3.1) are modied from those of (2.2) to:

24 d1d1d1d1. when 2 =  2 = 0 and [1, p1] are identied
where (d1)4 = 1
with [, p], these constraints reduce to those of (2.2). so (2.2) can be interpreted as a
gauge-xed version of (3.7).

note that 1

2 xmxm + pjj  d2,
so t is the expected free stress-tensor for (3.1) when d = 0. the modications of (3.7)

z z m + d11 + eid12 = 1

2 m

have been chosen such that the n=2 constraints have no singularities with the harmonic
constraints of (3.6). the absence of singularities with g+ is quite amazing and comes from
the fact that g+ can be written as

g+ = 

1
24

d(d(d(d( e2+3i )))) + g+
c

(3.8)

where d(y ) denotes the contour integral of d around y . furthermore, the generators

of (3.7) still form a c = 6 n=2 superconformal algebra. this algebra is guaranteed since

the constraints of (3.7) are invariant under the gauge transformations generated by (3.6)
and in the gauge 2 =  2 = 0, they reduce to the n=2 constraints of (2.2). so the free
action of (3.1), together with the constraints of (3.6) and (3.7), still describes a critical

n=2 superconformal eld theory.

3.2. massless compactication-independent vertex operators

to see how the harmonic constraints of (3.6) aect the massless open string vertex
operator of (2.3), consider a function v which depends of the zero modes of (xm, j, +i)

and which satises

(2  ei1)v = 0,

(3.9)

i.e. v has no poles with (3.6) where j =

2 jkk. dening

xm = xm +

(3.10)

+ = 1 + ei2,

(3.9) implies that v is a function of the zero modes of (xm, +,  + i), but is independent
of the zero modes of . so the component elds of v can be related to the component
elds of v in (2.3) by identifying x with x and + with .

where we have subtracted the surface term 1

placing eid1 with d2 using (3.6), the vertex operator of (3.12) closely resembles the
four-dimensional massless vertex operator of [9]. it is interesting to note that both the

four and six-dimensional massless vertex operators are of the form proposed by siegel in

[8] for the ten-dimensional vertex operator, u = r dz[dw  + ym am ] where w  is the

super-yang-mills eld-strength and am are the superspace gauge elds.

the closed massless vertex operator is the square of (3.12), i.e.

4. hybrid action in a curved background

given the n=2 d=6 spacetime-supersymmetric form of the action in a at background

in (3.3) and the closed massless vertex operators of (3.13), it is easy to guess the action in

a curved background if one ignores the fradkin-tseytlin term which couples the dilaton

to the worldsheet curvature. this action is given by

s0 =

 z d2z(

z + d j j

z + dj d kp j k) + sb + sc
(4.1)

m is the super-vierbein with a = (c, j, j) and m = (m, j, j), c = e c

where e a
m ym
is the vector current, j = e j
m ym are the spinor currents, and
p j k is the supereld whose lowest components are the bispinor ramond-ramond eld
strengths. the necessity of including the term proportional to dj d k can be seen from
the massless vertex operator of (3.13).

m ym and  j = e j

to reproduce the expected coupling-constant dependence of scattering amplitudes,

one needs a fradkin-tseytlin term which couples the spacetime dilaton to the worldsheet

curvature. as in the four-dimensional sigma model of [2], this term is constructed by cou-

pling spacetime compensator superelds to the n=(2,2) worldsheet supercurvature. the

n=(2,2) worldsheet supercurvature is described by a chiral and twisted-chiral worldsheet
supereld c and tc, and their complex conjugates 
tc. in the four-dimensional
sigma model, the worldsheet supercurvature coupled to spacetime superelds c and tc

c and 

which compensated a u (1)  u (1) subgroup of the u (1)  su (2) r-transformations of

n=2 d=4 supergravity. in the six-dimensional sigma model, the worldsheet supercurva-

ture superelds couple to spacetime superelds c and tc which compensate a u (1)u (1)

subgroup of the su (2)  su (2) r-transformations of n=2 d=6 supergravity. in both the

four and six-dimensional actions, the coupling term is dened as

sf t = z d2z[g g(cc) + g g+(tctc) + g+ g+(

c 

c) + g+ g(

tc

tc)]

(4.2)

where 

c and 

tc are the complex conjugates of c and tc. the complete sigma model

action is therefore s = s0 + sf t .

the spacetime compensator superelds c and tc are functions of the zero modes of

(xm, j,  j,  + i,  + i) which satisfy the chirality and twisted-chirality constraints

g+c = g+c = 0, g

c = g

c = 0,

(4.3)

g+tc = gtc = 0, g

tc = g+

tc = 0,

in addition to the constraints implied by (3.6) that

(1  ei2) = (1  ei2) = 0,

(4.4)

(  1  ei  2) = (  1  ei  2) = 0.

writing  = n,nen(+i)+n(+i)n,n, (4.3) and (4.4) imply that n,n
n < 0 or n < 0 and n,n

c = 0 when either
tc = 0 when either n < 0 or n > 0. to see that g+c = 0

8

implies that n,n
c = 0 when n < 0, observe that (3.8) and (4.4) imply that c has no poles
with e2+3i. the complex conjugate superelds 
tc are related to c and tc by
dening (j) = jkk, ( j) = jk ak, (e+i) = ei and (e+i) = ei.
one can check that this denition of complex conjugation implies that 
tc satisfy

c and 

c and 

(4.3) and (4.4).

the n=2 constraints for the superstring in a curved six-dimensional background are

given by

t = t0 + 2(c + 

c + tc + 

tc),

g+ = g+

0 + g+(

c + 

tc), g = g

0 + g(c + tc),

(4.5)

j = j0 + (c  

c + tc  

tc),

where [t0, g+
z and
j with j. the fradkin-tseytlin contribution to the constraints of (4.5) are analogous

0 , j0] are the n=2 constraints of (3.7) after replacing m

z with c

0 , g

to those discussed in [2] and [10] for the four-dimensional background.

5. relation to p su (2|2) action for ads3  s3

in reference [3], an action based on the p su (2|2) supergroup was constructed for
the superstring in an ads3  s3 background with ramond-ramond ux. although the
(z, z) symmetric part of this action was the usual group action for p su (2|2), the (z, z)

anti-symmetric part of this action contained complicated dependence on the chiral and

anti-chiral bosons  + i and  + i. the n=2 worldsheet superconformal generators also

depended in a complicated way on these bosons. when the paper was written, it was

unclear how to give a geometrical interpretation to this ( + i,  + i) dependence.

using the results of the previous section, it will now be shown how the rather compli-

cated ( + i,  + i) dependence in the action of [3] can be derived from a relatively simple

action whose only dependence on  + i and  + i comes from the harmonic constraints

of (3.6).

since the ads3  s3 background of interest has a constant dilaton, the fradkin-
tseytlin term of (4.2) contributes the usual euler number dependence which will be ig-
m , bm n and p j k
nored. the remaining part of the action is given by (4.1) where e a
take values determined by the ads3  s3 metric and by the ns-ns and r-r three-form
ux.

9

for convenience, only backgrounds with pure ramond-ramond ux will be discussed

although it should be easy to generalize the discussion to include backgrounds with ns-ns
ux. in the presence of a three-form r-r ux with values1

h 012

jk = h 345

jk = n jk,

the supereld p j k satises

p j k = n  jk

(5.1)

(5.2)

where the coupling constant  appears in (5.2) because there is no 2 factor in front of the
ramond-ramond h mnphmnp kinetic term in the action. furthermore, in the ads3  s3
background, one can choose the only non-zero values of bab = em

b bm n to be [1]

a e n

(5.3)

using habc = [abbc] + t[ab

tc j

k = (c)jlp l k, tc j

k = (c)  jlp k l,

it is easy to show that hc j k = 1

4 (c)jk and hc j k =  1

plugging these values for the background elds into (4.1), one obtains

the rst line of (5.5) is precisely the gs action for the ads3  s3 background which was
studied in [11] and which is based on the ads5  s5 action of [12]. however, the second
line of (5.5) is crucial for quantization and is absent from the action of [11].

1 this choice of three-form r-r ux is slightly more convenient that that of [3] since it preserves

a diagonal su(2) r-symmetry.

10

as discussed in [11][12], the currents [c, j,  j] can be identied with the currents

of the supergroup coset p su (2|2)  p su (2|2)/su (2)  su (2). if g takes values in the
supergroup p su (2|2)  p su (2|2), the left-invariant one-forms g1g can be dened as
(sj, k ) and ( sj, k ) which generate the lie algebra

[k , k ] = k   k   k  + k 

[k , sj] = sj  sj

{sj, sk} =

(5.6)

and similarly for the tilded currents.
(the untilded and tilded currents commute with
each other.) dening k  + k  to be the one-forms which are absent from the action to
provide the local su (2) su (2) invariance, the remaining six bosonic currents and sixteen
fermionic currents are related to [c, j,  j] as

c = c

(k   k ), j = sj + i sj,  j = sj  i sj

(5.7)

where (x, , ) parameterize the p su (2|2)p su (2|2)/su (2)su (2) coset supermanifold.
to further simplify the action of (5.5), one has two options. one option is to integrate

out all dj and d j worldsheet elds, producing the action

s =

(5.8)

using the identication of (5.7), the above action can be interpreted as a sigma model

action with wz term for the supercoset p su (2|2)  p su (2|2)/su (2)  su (2). in fact,

precisely this sigma model action was considered in [1] and shown to be one-loop confor-

mally invariant. of course, this action needs to be supplemented by the constraints of

(3.6) and (3.7) to remove the unphysical degrees of freedom.

a second option is to rst use the eight (3.6) constraints and the six local su (2) 

su (2) invariances to gauge-x to the identity the tilded p su (2|2) group parameters. this

gauge-xing can be inserted directly into the action of (5.5) since the group parameters

transform without derivatives under these gauge transformations. the resulting action
(after imposing the (3.6) constraints to solve for d2 and d 1 in terms of d1 and d 2) is

where x = ei++i and a term proportional to r d2z s1 s2 (with no  +i factors)

has been dropped since it is a total derivative [3].

this action is the same as that of [3] if one redenes    + log(2),     log(2),

   and   . the n=2 constraints of (4.5) can be related to those of [3] by

inserting the equation of motion for d1 into (4.5) in the gauge where all tilded currents
vanish. the result is
