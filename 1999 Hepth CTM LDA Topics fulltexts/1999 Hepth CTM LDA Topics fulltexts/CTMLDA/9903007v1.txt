abstract

this is an introduction to the maldacena conjecture on the equivalence
between n = 4 super yang-mills in minkowski space-time and type iib string
theory compactied on ads5  s5.

1 introduction

gravitational interactions are described by the einsteins theory of general relativity
or more in general by supergravity that is its supersymmetric extension, while the
other interactions are described by gauge eld theories. actually also the theory of
general relativity is a gauge theory corresponding to the gauging of the space-time
poincare group, while those that are more usually called gauge theories correspond
to the gauging of an internal symmetry group. but apart from the fact that they are
both gauge theories does it exist any deeper relation between them? do they imply
each other in a consistent quantum theory of gravity? in the framework of eld the-
ory there is no connection; they can both exist independently from each other, but
any eld theory involving gravity suers from the problem of non-renormalizability.
however, when we try to look at this question in the framework of string theory,
we see that they occur naturally together in the same theory and actually it has
not been possible to construct a string theory without both of them.

string theories were born from the attempt of describing the properties of the
strong interactions through the construction of the dual resonance model. it became
soon clear, however, that this model in its consistent form, that later on was rec-
ognized to correspond to the quantization of a relativistic string, contained all sort
of massless particles as gluons, gravitons and others except a massless pseudoscalar

1

particle corresponding to the pion that in the chiral limit is the only massless par-
ticle that we expect in strong interactions. because of this and other unphysical
features it became clear since the middle of the seventies that string theories could
not provide a theory for strong interactions, that in the meantime were successfully
described in the framework of qcd, but could instead be used as a consistent way
of unifying all interactions in a theory containing also quantum gravity [1]. it turns
out that all ve consistent string theories in ten dimensions all unify in a way or
another gravity with gauge theories. let us remind now how this comes about.

the type i theory is a theory of open and closed string. open strings have
chan-paton gauge degrees of freedom located at the end points and, because of
this, an open string theory contains the usual gauge theories. on the other hand a
pure theory of open strings is not consistent by itself; non-planar loop corrections
generate closed strings and a closed string theory contains gravity. therefore in
the type i theory open strings require for consistency closed strings. this implies
that gravity, that is obtained in the zero slope limit of closed strings, is a necessary
consequence of gauge theories, that are obtained in the zero slope limit of the open
string theory. the heterotic strings is instead a theory of only closed strings that
contains, however, both supergravity and gauge theories. but in this case gravity is
the fundamental theory and gauge theories are obtained from it through a stringy
kaluza-klein mechanism. the remaining consistent theories in ten dimensions are
the two type ii theories that at the perturbative level contain only closed strings and
no gauge degrees of freedom. however, they also contain non-perturbative objects,
the d-branes that are characterized by the fact that open strings can end on them.
therefore through the d-branes open strings also appear in type ii theories and
with them we get also gauge theories.
in conclusion all string theories contain
both gravity and gauge theories and therefore those two kinds of interactions are
intrinsically unied in string theories. but, since all string theories contain gravity,
it seems impossible to use a string theory to describe strong interactions. in fact
they are described by qcd that does not contain gravity!!

on the other hand it is known since the middle of the seventies that, if we
consider a non-abelian gauge theory with gauge group su(n) and we take the t
hooft limit where the number of colours n  , while the product g2
y m n  
is kept xed [2], the gauge theory simplies in the sense that the only diagrams
surviving in this limit are the planar ones. in the large n limit it can be shown that
the gauge invariant observables are determined by a master eld [3] that satises a
classical equation of motion. it has also been conjectured that in this limit qcd is
described by a string theory; the mesons are string excitations that are free when
n  . this idea is also supported by the experimental fact that hadrons lie on
linearly rising regge trajectories as required by a string model. the fact that the
large n expansion may be a good approximation also for low values of n as n = 3 in
the case of qcd is suggested by the validity of the zweigs rule and by the successful

2

explanation of the u(1)-problem in the framework of the large n expansion . the
fact, however, that any consistent string theories includes necessarily gravity has
led to call the string theory coming out from qcd as the qcd string because,
as qcd, it should not contain gravity. although many attempts have been made
to construct a qcd string none can be considered suciently satisfactory. this
problem has been with us for the last thirty years.

a more recent connection between gauge theories and gravity comes from the d-
branes. a system of n coincident d p-branes is a classical solution of the low-energy
string eective action in which only the metric, the dilaton and a rr (p + 1)-form
potential are dierent from zero. the metric is given by:

(ds)2 = h 1/2(y)dxdx + h 1/2(y)ijdyidyj

while the dilaton and rr potential are equal to:

e(0) = [h(y)](p3)/4

;

a01...p = [h(y)]1

(1.1)

(1.2)

(1.3)

where

h(y) = 1 +

r7p

kp =

gs

with r2  yiyi and q = 2(q+1)/2/[(q + 1)/2]. the indices  and  run along the
world volume of the brane, while the indices i and j run along the directions that
are transverse to the brane.

a system of n coincident d p-branes is described by the non-abelian version of
the born-infeld action, whose complete form is not yet known, but for our consid-
erations we can take of the form suggested in ref. [5]:

sbi =  (0)

p z dp+1 est r q det [g + 2f]

the brane tension is given by:

 (0)
p
gs

=

(2)1p

2gs

gs  e0

(1.4)

(1.5)

where the string coupling constant gs is identied with the value at innity of the
dilaton eld. g is the pullback of the metric g and f is a gauge eld leaving
on the brane. st r stands for a symmetrized trace over the group matrices. by
expanding the born-infeld action in powers of f we nd at the second order the
kinetic term for a non abelian gauge eld (the u(n) matrices are normalized as
t r(titj) = 1

we see here another connection between gravity and gauge theories. on one hand
the d-branes are classical solutions of the low-energy supergravity action, while on
the other hand they are described by a gauge eld theory whose action reduces at
low-energy to the usual action of yang-mills theory.

an interesting property of the d-brane solution in eqs.(1.1) and (1.2) is that for
large values of r the metric becomes at. therefore, being the curvature small, the
classical supergravity description provides a good approximation of the d brane. in
the following we want to study the behaviour of the classical solution in the near-
horizon limit corresponding to r  0 for p = 3 for which the dilaton in eq.(1.2) is
independent of r and the yang-mills coupling constant in eq.(1.6) is dimensionless
implying that the four-dimensional world volume theory is conformal invariant.
more precisely the near-horizon limit is dened by:

r  0

  0

u 

r
 = f ixed

(1.7)

in which also the regge slope is taken to zero, while u is kept xed. in this limit
we can neglect the factor 1 in the function h in eq.(1.3) and the metric in eq.(1.1)
becomes:

(ds)2
 

u 2

4ngs

(dx3+1)2 +

4ngs

u 2

du 2 +q4ngsd2

(1.8)

this is the metric of the manifold ads5  s5 where the two radii of ads5 and s5
are equal and given by:

r2

ads5 = r2

s5  b2 = q4ngs

that, using the relation g2

y m = 4gs following from eq.(1.6), implies:

b2

 = qng2

y m

(1.9)

(1.10)

the world volume theory of n coincident d 3-branes is n = 4 super yang-mills
theory in 3 + 1 dimensions with u(n) gauge group. on the other hand the classical
solution in eq.(1.8) is a good approximation when the radii of ads5 and s5 are very
big:

b2
 >> 1 = ng2

y m   >> 1

(1.11)

the fact that those two descriptions are simultaneously consistent for large values
of the coupling constant  brought maldacena [7] to formulate the conjecture that
the strongly interacting ( >> 1) n = 4 super yang-mills with gauge group u(n)
is actually equivalent to the ten-dimensional classical supergravity compactied on
ads5  s5. but supergravity is not a consistent quantum theory and therefore
in order to extend the conjecture to any value of  one has to nd a substitute
for classical supergravity. the natural way of extending the previous conjecture

4

is therefore to say that n = 4 super yang-mills is equivalent to type iib string
theory compactied on the special background ads5  s5 [7]. the parameters of
the yang-mills theory g2
y m and n are related to the parameters of string theory gs,
rs5 and  through the following relations:

g2
y m 


n

= 4gs

r2

s5 = r2

ads5 = 1/2

(1.12)

in conclusion, according to the maldacena conjecture, classical supergravity is a
good approximation if  >> 1, while in t hooft limit in which  is kept xed for
n   classical string theory is a good approximation for n = 4 super yang-
mills. in the t hooft limit in fact string loop corrections are negligible (gs << 1)
as one can see from the rst eq. in (1.12). finally yang-mills perturbation theory
is a good approximation when  << 1. the strongest evidence for the validity
of the maldacena conjecture comes from the fact that both n = 4 super yang-
mills and type iib string compactied on ads5  s5 have the same symmetries.
they are, in fact, both invariant under 32 supersymmetries, under the conformal
group o(4, 2), corresponding to the isometries of ads5, under the r-symmetry
group su(4), corresponding to the isometries of s5 and under the montonen-olive
duality [6] based on the group sl(2, z).
it is important to stress that the two
theories live on dierent spaces: iib string theory lives on ads5  s5, while n =
4 super yang-mills lives on the boundary of ads5 that is our four-dimensional
minkowski space. this is an explicit realization that a normal four-dimensional
yang-mills theory, as also qcd is, can be described by a string theory without
running into the problem that a string theory contains gravity while a gauge theory
does not. this old problem is solved in this case by the fact that the gauge and the
string theories live in dierent spaces. a new puzzle, however, arises in this case
because we usually connect a string theory with a conning gauge theory, while
instead n = 4 super yang-mills is a conformal invariant theory and therefore is in
the coulomb and not in the conning phase.
but apart from this puzzle, if two theories, as the type iib string theory com-
pactied on ads5  s5 and n = 4 super yang-mills theory, are equivalent then it
must be possible to specify for each eld q(x) of the boundary minkowski theory
the corresponding eld (y) of the bulk string theory and to show that, when we
compute corresponding correlators in the two theories, we get the same result. in
particular, in the boundary theory one can easily compute the generating functional
for correlators involving q(x)

z(0) =< er d4x0(x)q(x) >

(1.13)

by taking derivatives with respect to the arbitrary source 0(x) one can compute
any correlator involving the boundary eld q(x).
in refs. [8, 9] the recipy for
computing z(0) in the bulk theory has been given. first of all one must identify
0(x) with the boundary value of the eld (y), which lives in the bulk theory and
that corresponds to q(x) of the boundary theory. then the generating functional

5

given in eq.(1.13) is just obtained by performing in the bulk theory the functional
integral over  with the restriction that its boundary value be 0:

z(0) = z0

des[]

(1.14)

in computing the previous functional integral we can use classical supergravity in
the regime where  >> 1. otherwise for an arbitrary value of xed  for n  
we need to compute the tree diagrams of type iib string theory compactied on
ads5  s5.
a number of bulk elds have been identied to correspond to the various gauge
invariant composite elds of n = 4 super yang-mills. we do not have the time in
this talk to describe them in detail. in the following we will just describe in some
detail the correspondence between the dilaton eld of type iib supergravity and
f a showing in detail
the composite given by the yang-mills lagrangian f 2  f a
that the two-point functions that one obtains from both eqs.(1.13) and (1.14) are
coincident [8, 9].

since n = 4 super yang-mills theory with gauge group su(n) is a conformal
invariant quantum theory and the composite eld f 2 has dimension 4 the two-point
function involving two f 2 elds must have the following form:

< f 2(x)f 2(z) >

n 2

(~x  ~z)2

(1.15)

apart from an overall constant that we do not care to compute. the previous
correlator can also be obtained by using the lowest order perturbation theory in
n = 4 super yang-mills. ~x denotes here a minkowski four-vector.
in the bulk theory we only need the dilaton kinetic term in type iib supergravity
in d = 10 compactied on ads5  s5. taking into account that the volume of s5 is
equal to 3b3, where b is given in eq.(1.9), we need to consider the following action:

s =

3b3

where g = b2

approximation, we just need to solve the dilaton eq. of motion given by:

 is the metric of ads5 in the so-called poincare coordinates
in the limit  >> 1, where classical supergravity is a good

0

 [gg] = 0

(1.17)

the solution of the previous equation, that is equal to 0 on the boundary (corre-
sponding to the limit x0  0), can be given in terms of the greens function:

(x0, ~x) = z d4~x k(x0, ~x; ~z) 0(~z)

; k(x0, ~x; ~z)

[x2
0 + (~x  ~z)2]4

(1.18)

inserting the solution found in eq.(1.18) in the classical action we get that the
contribution to the classical action is entirely due to the boundary term

(~x  ~z)8

(1.19)

where we have introduced a cut o  at the lower limit of integration, that, however,
cancels out after having inserted eq.(1.18) in eq.(1.19). in conclusion in the classical
approximation ( >> 1) we get

z(0) = exp" 3b8

(1.20)

taking into account eq.(1.9) and that 22

tion we can get immediately the two-point function:

< f 2(x)f 2(z) >=

(~x  ~z)8

(1.21)

that agrees with the expression given in eq.(1.15).
