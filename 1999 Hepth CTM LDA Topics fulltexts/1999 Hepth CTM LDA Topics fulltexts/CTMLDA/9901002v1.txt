abstract

we show that the minimally coupled massless scalar wave equation in the background of

an six-dimensional extremal dyonic string (or d1-d5 brane intersection) is exactly solvable,

in terms of mathieu functions. using this fact, we calculate absorption probabilities for

these scalar waves, and present the explicit results for the rst few low energy corrections

to the leading-order expressions. for a specic tuning of the dyonic charges one can reach

a domain where the low energy absorption probability goes to zero with inverse powers

of the logarithm of the energy. this is a dividing domain between the regime where the

low energy absorption probability approaches zero with positive powers of energy and the

regime where the probability is an oscillatory function of the logarithm of the energy. by

the conjectured ads/cft correspondence, these results shed novel light on the strongly

coupled two-dimensional eld theory away from its infrared conformally invariant xed

point (the strongly coupled non-critical string).

introduction

one of the more intriguing recent developments in string theory and m-theory has been the

conjecture that when the theory is placed in a background that is of the form of a product
of an m-dimensional anti-de sitter adsm spacetime and an n-sphere sn, it is dual to a
superconformal theory on the boundary of the adsm spacetime [1]. the adsm  sn sphere
structure arises in the near-horizon limit of non-dilatonic extremal p-branes [2, 3], and thus

one arrives at a conjectured relation between aspects of the p-brane supergravity solution

and the superconformal theory on the adsm boundary.

this conjectured relationship has been explored in a number of contexts. one partic-

ular aspect has been probed by studying the absorption probabilities and scattering cross-

sections for massless elds propagating in the supergravity background describing p-brane

solitons [4, 5, 6].

in particular, one is principally interested in studying the absorption

probability for incident waves with low frequency . for example, the leading low-energy

absorption probability for  = 0 partial wave of the the minimally coupled massless scalar

eld (dilaton) determines its two-point correlation function at the conformally invariant
infrared xed point of the strongly coupled (m  1)-dimensional eld theory [7, 8, 9, 10].
sub-leading corrections are expected to shed light on the eects of (irrelevant) perturbations

away from the conformally invariant xed point.

in many of the examples that have been studied, the wave equations turn out not

to be explicitly solvable in closed form, and as a result various techniques for matching

solutions in an overlap between approximately-solvable inner and outer regions have been

used [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 5, 6, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. the possibility of making

such overlapping approximations arises because of the low-frequency nature of the incident

waves. one can then obtain expressions for absorption probabilities as power-series in .

in most cases where such approximations must be made, it is dicult to obtain more than

a few sub-leading corrections to the leading-order absorption probabilities.

on the other hand, in certain special cases (of extremal p-brane systems) the wave

equations turn out to be exactly solvable, and in these situations one has more complete

control over the calculation of corrections to the leading-order absorption probability. one

particularly interesting example arises for the extremal d3-brane, where the wave equation

for massless scalars turns out to be precisely the (modied) mathieu equation [25]. this

equation has been much studied by mathematicians, and techniques have been developed

that are directly adaptable to the problem of calculating the absorption probability. indeed,

the work of [26] formed the basis of the approach used in [25] for calculating the d3-brane

2

absorption probability.

in this paper we consider another example where the wave equation is exactly solv-

able, namely the extremal dyonic string [28, 29] in six dimensions. this conguration can

alternatively be viewed, by diagonal dimensional reduction, as being equivalent to an ex-

tremal 2-charge black hole in d = 5, a d1-brane/d5-brane intersection in d = 10, or an

m2-brane/m5-brane intersection in d = 11 [27]. from the point of view of the ads/cft

conjecture this is an especially interesting case, since the near-horizon geometry of the dy-
onic string approaches ads3  s3, and thus the superconformal eld theory [30] is dened
on the two-dimensional boundary of ads3. a controlled method to calculate the absorp-

tion probability to an arbitrary order in energy corrections is thus of interest; such a result

would provide information on the strongly coupled two-dimensional eld theory perturbed

away from the infrared conformally-invariant xed point by (irrelevant) operators, i.e. a

strongly-coupled non-critical string would be probed.

low energy absorption probabilities for the d1-brane/d5-brane system, or equivalently

the six-dimenesional dyonic string, were considered in [22], by using the approximate meth-

ods described above, which involve a division of the spacetime into overlapping inner and

outer regions. in particular, the next-to-leading order energy correction to the s-wave ab-

sorption probability was given there.

in this paper we show that the wave equation for the minimally coupled massless scalar

in the extremal six-dimensional dyonic string background has in fact an exact solution; a

straightforward change of variables transforms it into the modied mathieu equation. thus

we can again, as was done for the d3-brane [25], make use of the results in [26], and calculate

the absorption probabilities to an arbitrary order in the energy expansion. however, there

are some signicant dierences between the nature of the low energy expansion of the results

presented in this paper and those of the extremal d3-brane, which we shall explain later in

the paper.

the paper is organised as follows. in section 2, we write down the scalar wave equation

in the background of an extremal dyonic string, and show that it can be transformed into the

mathieu equation. in section 3, we discuss the details of how to solve the mathieu equation,

paying particular attention to some subtleties associated with the particular parameter

values that arise in the dyonic background, and their energy dependence. we obtain the

absorption probability as an energy expansion for a xed dyonic string conguration. in

section 4, we explore some dierent regions in the parameter space, for which the small

expansion parameter is governed by the ratio of the two dyonic string charges. by tuning

3

the ratio of the two charges one probes regimes whose absorption probabilities exhibit novel

functional dependence on the energy parameter.

2 scalar wave equation for the dyonic string

we shall consider a minimally coupled scalar eld propagating in the background of an

extremal dyonic string in six dimensions, for which the metric is

ds2

6 = (he hm)1/2 (dt2 + dx2) + (he hm)1/2 (dr2 + r2 d2

3) ,

where

he = 1 +

r2 ,

hm = 1 +

the wave equation  = 0 can be separated, by assuming coordinate dependence

(t, r, i) = (r) y (i) ei t ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

where y (i) denotes an harmonic on s3, satisfying 2y = ( + 2) y on the unit 3-sphere.
the radial function (r) therefore satises the equation

where 2

e = 2 qe and 2

(2.5) if we were to consider the intersection of a d1-brane and a d5-brane in d = 10, or

for such an intersection with ns-ns branes, or an intersection of an m2-brane and an m5-

brane in d = 11. we would also encounter the same equation if we considered a 2-charge

black hole in d = 5. these equivalences hold because the associated brane congurations

are related to one another by diagonal dimensional reduction, and the wave equation is

invariant under such reductions on the world volume.

it is easy to see that the equation (2.5) can be transformed into the mathieu equation,

by dening

whence we obtain

note that   2, and that  will be treated as a small parameter (corresponding to low-
energy waves).

the result that we have found here is in many respects similar to the one for the d3-

brane obtained in [25], where it was shown that the scalar wave equation in the d3-brane

background could be reduced to the mathieu equation. however, a signicant dierence

arises in our case, due to the fact that now the parameter , appearing in the mathieu

equation, itself depends on the small (energy dependent) parameter . although we shall

be able to follow the same general strategy for solving the equation as the one described in

[26, 25], some adjustments will be required in order to take into account the additional 

(energy) dependence of parameter .

the solutions to the mathieu equation are constructed as an iterative sequence of terms

which correspond to a power series in the small parameter . there are various ways in

which one can view the relation between  and  in equation (2.8). the simplest of these
is to think of it as dening  as a power series in , so that one has  = 1
2 ( + 1) + o(2).
in this viewpoint, one ensures that  is small by choosing the frequency  to be suciently

small, with no constraints on the charges. we calculate the absorption probabilities within

this framework in section 3. one can alternatively think of  as being a freely-speciable

parameter (independent of ), where one ensures that , now viewed as being dened by the

relation between  and  in equation (2.8), is small, by choosing the charges so that  is

suciently large. we calculate the absorption probabilities within this framework in section

4. (in order to distinguish the somewhat dierent interpretations of the  parameter in the

two viewpoints, we replace  by  in section 4 when we are viewing it as a derived quantity.)
it is of particular interest is to explore the limit where   0, since this approaches the
boundary of the region 2  0, which has a novel low-energy behaviour for the absorption
probability.

3 solving the mathieu equation

a procedure for solving the mathieu equation was developed in [26], and formed the basis of

the approach used in [25]. in order for us to present our notation and results, and to explain

certain subtleties that arise, it will be necessary for us to review the procedures developed

in [26, 25]. at the same time we shall elaborate on some delicacies in the calculations that

were not explicitly discussed in those papers.

3.1 the floquet expansion

the mathieu equation can be solved by mapping the problem into one of solving a dierence

equation for coecients in a series expansion. specically, the solution can be expressed in

the floquet form

(z) =



xn=

(1)n c(n + ) e2(n+) z ,

(3.1)

where  is a certain constant, related somewhat non-trivially to the parameters in the

mathieu equation, which will be determined later. the quantity 2 is known as the floquet

exponent, or mathieu characteristic exponent. substituting (3.1) into (2.7), one nds that

the coecients c(n + ) satisfy the recursion relation

c(x + 1) + c(x  1) =

x2  2

2

c(x) .

(3.2)

convergence of the series (3.1) requires that c(x + 1) << c(x  1), and hence an approx-
imation c (0)(x) to the solution of this three-term recursion relation can be obtained by

solving the two-term relation

c (0)(x  1) =

x2  2

2

c (0)(x) .

this is easily seen to lead to

c (0)(x) =

2x

(x +  + 1) (x   + 1)

.

a solution to the full recursion relation (3.2) can now be obtained by writing

c(x) = c (0)(x) b(x) ,

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

where, substituting into (3.2), one nds that the coecients b(x) must satisfy

b(x)  b(x + 1) = 

4

((x + 1)2  2) ((x + 2)2  2)

b(x + 2) .

(3.6)

6

since  is treated as a small parameter, we can therefore solve this to any desired accuracy by

an iterative procedure, in which the right-hand side is treated as a source term constructed

using the solution for the b(x) obtained at the previous iteration. thus we solve

b (i)(x)  b (i)(x + 1) = a(x) b (i1)(x + 2) ,

where

a(x)  

and b (0)(x) = 1. the solution to (3.6) is then given by

4

((x + 1)2  2) ((x + 2)2  2)

b(x) = xi0

b (i)(x) = 1 + b (1)(x) + b (2)(x) +  .

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

each successive term in this sum is smaller than its predecessor by a multiplicative factor of
4, the small expansion parameter of the iterative solution.1 it should be emphasised that

in the case we are considering here for the dyonic string, unlike the d3-brane discussed in

[25], the constant  in (2.7) is itself  dependent. however, this does not alter the validity

of the iterative procedure.

it is straightforward to see from the above discussion that the solutions for the quantities

b (i)

n are given by

a(x + p) ,

b (1)(x) = xp0
b (2)(x) = xp10 xp22
b (3)(x) = xp10 xp22 xp32

...

a(x + p1) a(x + p1 + p2) ,

a(x + p1) a(x + p1 + p2) a(x + p1 + p2 + p3) ,

(3.10)

b (i)(x) = xp10 xp22 xpi2

a(x + p1) a(x + p1 + p2) a(x + p1 +  + pi) .

dening

s(m0, m1, . . . , mq) 



xi=0

q

yj=0

(a(x + i + j))mj ,

(3.11)

it can then be straightforwardly shown [26] that the coecients b (i)(x) are given by

b (1)(x) = s(1) ,

b (2)(x) = 1

2 s(1)2  1

2 s(2)  s(1, 1) ,

etc. .

(3.12)

1there is a subtlety concerning this point, which we shall address in detail later. for now, we just remark

that the statement is true provided that b(i)(x) is evaluated for a suciently large (positive) value of x, and

that we can arrange for this criterion to be met.

7

the sums s(m0, m1, . . . , mq) can all be performed explicitly, with the results expressed

in terms of the digamma and polygamma functions. the expressions for s(1), s(2) and

s(1, 1) were given in [25]. we shall just present the expression for s(1) here, since it is the

only sum needed for our present purposes:

s(1) =

(2x + 3) 4

(42  1) (2  (x + 1)2)

+

(1 +  + x)  (1   + x)

 (42  1)

4 ,

(3.13)

where (x)  (x)/(x) is the digamma function. (our denition of s(m0, m1, . . . , mq)
includes a factor of (4)n relative to the one in [25], where n = pq
i=0 mi is the rank of
s(m0, m1, . . . , mq). thus our s(1) is (4) times the one in [25]; s(2) and s(1, 1) have
additional factors of 8, and so on.) as we shall discuss below, the series in (3.11) dening

s(1) is convergent, and free of singularities, provided that the denominators in a(x), given by

(3.8), do not happen to vanish for some particular terms in the summation. in particular,

this means that for generic x the expression (3.13) should be nite for all values of the
parameter . there are apparent divergences at  =  1
and by taking the limit    1
perfectly nite.2

2 , but these are actually spurious,
2 with due care, the expression (3.13) can be seen to be

3.2 the floquet exponents

the constant , related to the floquet exponent 2, can be determined from the observation
that (z) with exponent 2 and (z) with exponent 2 are two floquet solutions that
must be proportional to one another. from (3.1) one then reads o that the coecients

c(n + ) must satisfy the relation

c(n + ) =  c(n  ) ,

for all n ,

(3.14)

where  is an n-independent constant.

in fact it suces to impose (3.14) for just two

consecutive values of n, say n = 0 and n = 1, since all the rest can then be deduced using

(3.2). thus the content of (3.14) is just two independent equations, which determine the

two unknowns  and . in particular, we may conclude that  is determined by the equation

2a similar phenomenon arises also in the expressions that one obtains for the higher functions

c() c( + 1)
c(  1) c()

= 1 .

(3.15)

s(m0, m1, . . . , mq). for example the expression for the sum s(1, 1), given in [25], has apparent diver-
gences not only at  =  1

2 , but also at  = 1. again, these are spurious, and a careful limiting procedure

reveals that s(1, 1) is indeed perfectly nite at these values.

8

the recursion relation (3.2) can be re-expressed as g(x) = (v (x)  g(x + 1))1, where
g(x)  c(x)/c(x 1) and v (x)  (x2  2)/2. this may be solved to give the continued
fraction

g(x) =

1

v (x) 

v (x+1)

1

1

v (x+2)

.

(3.16)

it follows that (3.15), which can be rewritten as g() g(1  ) = 1, can be solved to give
 as a power series in :

 = xn0

n 2n = 0 + 1 2 + 2 4 +  .

(3.17)

note that in our case we obtain a power series in 2, by contrast to the power series in
4 that arose for the d3-brane in [25]. this is because our coecient 2 in the mathieu

equation for the dyonic string is itself  dependent, as given in (2.8). for the rst four
partial waves,  = 0, 1, 2, 3, we nd, up to order 8:

in fact if  takes a generic non-integer value, (3.19) is universally

valid. the integer values for  have to be treated carefully because the general solution for

9

 develops poles at the integer values, and one has to resort to a case-by-case analysis. it
seems that in fact only  = 0 and  = 1 are not described by the general formula (3.19).3

3.3 asymptotic behaviour and absorption probabilities

a remarkable property of the floquet solution of the mathieu equation is that one can

re-express the series expansion (3.1) in terms of bessel functions rather than exponentials,
with the same coecients c(n + ) (up to (1)n factors). (the explanation can be traced
back to the fact that exponential functions and bessel functions are closely related via the

laplace transform [32].) the required solution of the mathieu equation, which is in-going
on the horizon at z = , can be written in the form

(z) = m(, z) 



xn=

c(n + )

c()

jn(2 ez) h (1)

n+2(2 ez) ,

(3.20)

(the second solution is obtained by choosing an independent bessel function, such as h (2)

n+2,

in place of the rst hankel function h (1)

n+2.)

the series (3.9) for (z) is dominated by the n = 0 term near the horizon, where z  ,
and this allows the asymptotic behaviour in the z   region to be read o easily. to
determine the behaviour at spatial innity, corresponding to z  , one can make use of
the fact, mentioned earlier, that (z) with floquet exponent 2 is proportional to (z)
with floquet exponent 2. in fact from (3.14) one obtains the result that

m(, z) =

c()
c() m(,z) .

(3.21)

after some further steps described in detail in [25], in which one extracts the ratio between

the amplitudes of the ingoing and outgoing waves at spatial innity, one concludes that the

3in this section, we shall present explicit results for corrections up to and including o(6) with respect to

the leading-order results for absorption probabilities. one might think, therefore, that it would be sucient
to determine  up to o(6), since it has a -independent constant term for its leading order. however, as

will be seen in the calculation of the absorption probability p in (3.22) and (3.23) below, there is a factor
of |e2i    e2i |2 in the expression for p , and so the fact that the constant terms in  are integers or
half-integers means that |e2i    e2i | is a quantity of o(2), rather than the naively-expected o(1).
consequently, in the calculation of |e2i    e2i | it is necessary to work with  up to o(8), for the
purposes of eventually obtaining corrections up to o(6) in the absorption probabilities. similarly, the
occurrence of a pole in (   + 1) in (3.4) means that one must also work with  to order 8 in

that expression too, when calculating c() using (3.5). by the same token, in the d3-brane calculations
described in [25], one should calculate  up to o(16) in order to obtain corrections up to o(12) in the

absorption probabilities.

(3.22)

(3.23)

note that when determining the orders in  to which one must work so as to obtain cor-

rections to p to a specied order in , one must be careful of a number of points. one

such point was discussed in footnote 3, relating to the fact that the leading-order terms in

 are always integers or half-integers. another point is that if the leading-order term in 
is a -independent constant, then if this constant happens to equal 1 then the quantity
|  1|, which would naively have been of o(1), would actually instead be of higher
order in . this in turn would necessitate evaluating  to a higher order in  than one

might naively have expected, for the purposes of nding the corrections to the absorption

probability up to some particular order in . this particular subtlety does not arise in our

calculations in this section, but it will play a role in the calculations in section 4.

the computation of the absorption probability is now reduced to the problem of calcu-
lating the ratio c()/c(), where c(x) is determined from (3.5), (3.9), (3.11) and (3.12).
it is at this point that we meet a subtlety, which was not explicitly encountered in the gen-

eral discussion in [26]. it arises because the parameters that occur in our mathieu equation

are not generic, but are instead rather specic ones that are fortuitously inconvenient.

it is evident from (3.8) that the sums in (3.11) are rapidly convergent, and that the

possibility of divergent behaviour would arise only if the denominators in a(x) were to go

to zero for some particular low term in the summations. since x, and , are functions

of the small parameter , the issue that concerns us here is therefore not that the sums

s(m0, m1, . . . , mq) might be innite, but rather that they might acquire inverse powers of
 that could counteract the manifest 4 numerator in (3.8).

if this were to occur, then

our implicit assumption that each term b (i)(x) in (3.9) were smaller than its predecessor
b (i1)(x) by a factor of 4 would be invalid. at the very least this would complicate

the discussion because it would mean that we would have to work to higher order in the

iterative solutions b (i)(x) than naively appeared necessary. at worst, it could be dicult

to determine whether one had included suciently many terms in the iterative solution to

give an accurate result to the desired order in .

first, let us note that no diculty of this kind arises in the calculation of c(). this
2 ( + 1) + o(2), and hence from (3.8) it follows

2 ( + 1) + o(2), and  = 1

is because  = 1

11

that all the quantities a(x + i + j)/4 appearing in the sums (3.11) are strictly nite as 

tends to zero. if we dene the rank n = pq
i=0 mi for the sum s(m0, m1, . . . , mq), then it
follows that the quantities 4n s(m0, m1, . . . , mq), evaluated at x = , are all of the form
of a non-zero constant +o(2) as  tends to zero, and so the iterative solutions b (i)() do
indeed have the naively expected form b (i)() = o(4i).

the potential diculties arise when one considers c(), since now we see from (3.8)
that for suciently small values of the summation variables in (3.11) one will encounter

denominators in a(x) that tend to zero as  tends to zero. this means that these sums
s(m0, m1, . . . , mq), evaluated at x = , and the associated iterative solutions b (i)(),
will have  dependence whose leading order is at a more dominant power than the naively

expected one.

the easiest way to handle this problem is to make use once again of the recursion relation
(3.6) for b(x). by iterating it n times, we can express b() in terms of b(n  ) and
b(n + 1 ). thus we can choose n =  + 1, so that the leading-order constant term in the
 expansion of n  is precisely the same positive constant as occurs in the  expansion of
 itself. by this means, we reduce the problem of calculating b(), and hence c(), to
the problem of calculating b( 1
2 (+1)+1+o(2)). by our previous
discussion, these cases are easily evaluated, in terms of quantities s(m0, m1, . . . , mq) that

2 (+1)+o(2)) and b( 1

have precisely the expected 4k leading-order dependences, where k = pi mi. note that,

as mentioned in footnote 3, one must be careful to include one additional order in 2 in

the expansion for , over and above the naively expected one, on account of the pole at
 = 0 in the quantity (   + 1) that arises in the computation of c() using (3.4)
and (3.5).

the upshot from the above discussion is that provided we handle the c() calculation
carefully, it is necessary to include only the rst iterative correction b (1)(x) = s(1) in order
to obtain our results for absorption probabilities with corrections up to o(6) to the leading-
order result. (by the same token, the results up to o(12) corrections for the d3-brane,
discussed in [25], require the inclusion only of the rst three iterations b (1)(x), b (2)(x) and

b (3)(x).) of course the fact that each term b (i)(x) comes with an overall leading-order
4i factor means that one need calculate the associated sums s(m0, m1, . . . , mq) only up
to n4i corrections in order to obtain to obtain a results for b(x) to order n. (assuming,

as usual, that the necessary recursion using (3.6) is performed rst, so that the b (i)(x) are
evaluated at arguments x  .)

we nd that the absorption probability p for the th partial wave has the general

note that our result for b1,1 at  = 0 agrees in magnitude, but not in sign, with the

result obtained in [22].

for general values of  it is quite straightforward to obtain expressions for the coecients

b1,0 and b1,1 in (3.24), using procedures analogous to those that we described previously.
the only new feature is that in order to calculate b() in terms of b(x) with appropriately
positive arguments ( + 1  ) and ( + 2  ), one must now apply the recursion relation
(3.6) a total of ( + 1) times. up to order 2, it is easy to see that one need only solve
(3.6) to linear order in a(x), and evaluate b( + 1  ) and b( + 2  ) to zeroth order,
b( + 1  ) = 1 + o(4) and b( + 2  ) = 1 + o(4), giving

b() = 1 +



xi=0

a( + i) +  .

(3.26)

furthermore, it is clear that only those terms for which the denominator in a(x) in (3.8)
has zeros at  = 0, namely i =  and i =   1, will give o(2) contributions. this leads to
the result

b() = 1 +

  ( + 2)

+ o(4) .

(3.27)

after further straightforward calculations, we nd that the absorption probability is given

where (x)  (x)/(x) is the digamma function. note that in this case we have not
absorbed the euler gamma constant  in a rescaling of  in the logarithm. however, for
all integer  the digamma function has the form ( + 1) = r  , where r is a rational
number, and so the usual  = e  rescaling will enable the euler constant to be absorbed

in a natural fashion.

4 fixed-energy absorption, and phase transitions

so far, we have calculated absorption probabilities in the regime where  is xed, and  is

a small parameter (see eqn. (2.8) for denitions of these quantities). these results describe

the probabilities as continuous functions of low-energy incident waves, in a given dyonic

string background. in this section, we shall study a dierent regime, where , dened in

(2.8), is xed. namely, since the background depends on two charge parameters qe and

qm, one can adjust the dyonic background by tuning  in such a way that  is xed (for

14

a xed value of ). this implies that

1

4 ( + 1)2  2 = 2  = 1

4 2 m

(4.1)

is xed, where m = qe + qm is the mass per unit length of the string. the low energy
expansion with   1 implies that   1 ( 1/ can be viewed as the expansion parameter).
note that in this case 2 m can be large, provided that  is suciently large.

in order not to cause confusion with the previous section, we write the mathieu equation

as follows:

where

 + (82 cosh(2z)  42)  = 0 ,

2 

1

4 ( + 1)2  2



.

(4.2)

(4.3)

in other words  is now viewed as a function of , having rst specied . it is arranged

so that  is small by choosing the charges so that  is suciently large. this should be

contrasted with the viewpoint in section 3, where the parameter  is chosen to be small

by taking  to be small, with the charges unconstrained and with  a derived quantity

following from the expression in equation (2.8).

this equation is analogous to the mathieu equation discussed in [25], in that 2 is now a
given xed parameter, independent of the expansion parameter . however, in our case 2

can be arbitrary, whereas in [25] the analogous parameter could take only discrete integer

or half-integer values. we see from (2.8) that depending on the value of , we can have 2

either positive, negative or zero.

4.1 generic 2 > 0

the floquet exponents in this case turn out to be given by

this result will be valid for all generic values of , but breaks down at the poles occurring

when  is an integer or half-integer. we shall return to a discussion of these special cases

later, and concentrate for now on the generic situation when (4.4) is valid. it is useful to

dene

 = 1

2 l + 1 ,

15

(4.5)

so that for now, we shall consider cases where l is not an integer. for such generic values

of the parameter  there are no subtleties involving the occurrence of poles or zeros in the
calculation of c(), nor in the expression |  1| appearing in (3.22). we shall just
present results for the rst two corrections to the leading-order absorption. one has to
distinguish between two cases, according to whether  > 1
2 later). the reason for this distinction is that when  > 1
case  = 1
order corrections are always of the form 4 and 4 log , whilst if  < 1
order correction is of the form 8. for  > 1

l + 1

in the previous subsection, we saw that for generic values of   1
l non-integer, the leading-order absorption probability is of the form

2 l + 1, corresponding to

pl  4l .

(4.9)

this result is not applicable if l is an integer. this can be seen both from the resulting poles
in the expression (4.4) for , and the singular behaviour of (2) and the trigonometric
functions in (4.6) and (4.8). in fact the absorption probabilities for the special cases l =

integer are precisely those calculated in [25]. these have the leading-order form

pl  8+4l .

16

to be precise, the absorption probabilities in these cases are given by [25]

where  = e . the explicit results for the coecients bn,k with k  n  3 were given for
l = 0, 1, 2 in [25]. in order to calculate the corrections up to this 12 order, it is necessary
to calculate the floquet exponent 2 up to order 16, for the reasons that we discussed in

footnote 3. they are given by

(4.12)

it is also necessary to calculate the sums s(m0, m1, . . . , mq) up to rank n  pi mi = 3.

the expressions for n = 1 and n = 2 are given in [25].

there are in fact special values of the integer l which themselves must be treated as
special cases. one of these is l = 2, corresponding to 2 = 0. the other is l = 1,
corresponding to 2 = 1

4 . these two cases are discussed in the next two subsections.

4.3 2 = 1

in this case, the floquet exponent 2 is given by

2 + i 2  15 i

3 2) 4 + (cid:17) .

(4.14)

in fact this result can also be read o directly from the  = 0 expressions in (3.25), by

setting  = 0.

4.4 2 = 0

when  = 0, we nd that the floquet exponent is given by

17

where  = e . note that as   0 the absorption probability (4.16) approaches zero not
as a positive (integer) power of , but instead as (log )2. this result indicates that on
the eld theory side, the infrared limit with the specic choice of the dyonic background

that ensures  = 0 exhibits new features. for example, the two-point correlation function

for the minimally-coupled scalar [7] has a leading non-zero contribution that is inherently
quantum in nature (as signalled by the log  dependence). note that the 2 = 0 case

that we have considered here is an example of the kind we mentioned in section 3.2, where

the -independent term in the expansion for  is equal to 1, implying that one loses the
naively-expected leading-order constant when one evaluates |  1|.

it would be interesting to explore the eects of innitesimal deviations from the limit
 = 0. it turns out that if one takes a special slice 2 = b24, where b = constant, one

obtains a systematic expansion of  around small :

2

(4.17)

in this case the absorption probability has the following form:

p =

2

3 (1+ b2

2 + (2 log )2 +o(8)(cid:17) ,
2 + (2 log )2 (cid:16)1 8
(4.18)
note that as one approaches 2  b24, only the sub-leading term in the  expansion

2 )4 (2 log )2 8

3 [(3)(8+b2)6]

4 log 

depends on b2.

4.5 2 < 0

one can see from (4.3) that it is possible to choose the parameters so that 2 becomes

negative, while keeping  small. in such a case, we may write

where  is real, and related to  by

 = i  ,

2 =

1
4 ( + 1)2 + 2



.

(4.19)

(4.20)

in this case the floquet exponents are given by (4.4) with  = i . the absorption prob-

ability is now qualitatively dierent in form. in particular, the leading-order contribution

becomes oscillatory as a function of ; we nd that it is given by

p =

(4.21)

18

where

.

(4.22)

the oscillations become insignicant if  >> 1. again this region exhibits novel func-

tional dependence of the absorpiton probability on , thus signalling novel eld theoretical

phenomena on the dual side.

5 conclusions

in this paper, we have studied the solutions of the minimally coupled scalar wave equation

in the background of a six-dimensional extremal dyonic string. owing to the fact that

the equation is equivalent to the modied mathieu equation, the wave-functions can be

constructed exactly, in the sense that one can obtain exact solutions as power series in the

parameter 2 appearing in the mathieu equation (2.7). this provides a systematic power-

series expansion that is quite dierent in nature from a power-series solution of a dierential

equation in some restricted range of the independent variable. in particular, it allows one

to have complete control over the relation between the small-distance and large-distance

asymptotics of the wave functions; it is this information that is needed in order to calculate

the absorption probabilities.

since the dyonic string background depends on two charge parameters qe and qm,

there are two independent dimensionless quantities that can play the role of ordering pa-

rameters in the iterative solution of the mathieu equation. one of these is the quantity
 = 1

4 2 qe qm, which can be arranged to be small by taking the frequency  of the wave
suciently small. the other parameter is 1/ = qeqm/(qe +qm)  1/2, which provides

a measure of the ratio between the electric and magnetic charges qe and qm. in section

3 we calculated the absorption probability at low frequency, with  xed, i.e. with a xed

dyonic string background. in this case the leading-order constant term in the expansion
for  can take only discrete values, namely the integers and half-integers 1

2 ( + 1), where
 characterises the angular dependence of the th partial wave. the low-frequency expan-
sion arises in even powers of  along with the characteristic dependence on powers of log 
( = e, where  is eulers constant). these results are analogous in structure to those
for other extremal black-hole or p-brane backgrounds. for example, the occurrence of log 

in sub-leading terms in the energy expansion for the absorption probability is analogous

to what is seen in other examples, such as the m-branes and d3-brane [20, 25]. by the

ads/cft correspondence, the results of section 3 should yield information on correlation

19

functions in strongly coupled two-dimensional quantum eld theory perturbed away from

the infrared conformally invariant xed point.

in section 4 we calculated absorption probabilities in a dierent parameter regime,

namely where  is held xed, with 1/ being used as the small order-parameter of the

iterative solution of the mathieu equation. this can be viewed as an expansion in which
an incident wave of xed frequency (satisfying   1) is absorbed in the dyonic string
background with a range of charge ratios, in a limit where  is suciently large, implying

that the charge ratio is very large, in this case the value of  is xed, but can be chosen
to have an arbitrary value. we rst obtained results for generic positive values of 2. the

expressions for floquet exponents and absorption probabilities become singular when 

takes integer or half-integer values, and these cases have to be treated separately; this was

discussed in section 4.2.

a case of particular interest which itself lies outside the general discussion of special

cases in section 4.2 is when  = 0, discussed in section 4.4. in this situation, we nd that

the absorption probabilities depend inversely on powers of log , which seems to indicate

a correspondence to an intrinsically quantum regime of the two-dimensional eld theory.

the  = 0 point can be viewed as a critical point, since the absorption probabilities for
2 > 0 and for 2 < 0 (discussed in section 4.5) are qualitatively dierent. when 2 > 0,
the absorption probability vanishes in the limit   0 and approaches this limit with a
positive (multiple of 4) power of . on the other hand when 2 < 0, the leading-order

behaviour becomes an oscillatory function of log . we also studied the region close to the
critical point  = 0, by taking 2 = b2 4, with b constant.

owing to the fact that the boundary conformal eld theory for the extremal dyonic

string is two-dimensional, this example provides an especially manageable arena for making

concrete tests of the ads/cft conjecture. the fact that on the supergravity side one has

full control over the study of the scattering problem provides a starting point for addressing

the corresponding strongly coupled non-critical two-dimensional eld theory.

acknowledgements

after this work was completed, we learned from steven gubser that he and akikazu

hashimoto were also aware that the wave equation in the extremal dyonic string back-

ground could be transformed into the mathieu equation [33]. we are grateful to him for

correspondence on his unpublished work [33] and useful comments. we also acknowledge

helpful discussions with steve fulling. we have made extensive use of mathematica and

maple for calculations.
