the local action of an su (2) gauge theory in general co-
variant abelian gauges and the associated equivariant brst
symmetry that guarantees the perturbative renormalizabil-
ity of the model are given. ghost-antighost condensation is
shown to occur at arbitrarily small coupling and leads to prop-
agators that are nite at euclidean momenta for all elds
except the abelian photon. the mechanism eliminates
the non-abelian infrared divergences in the perturbative high-
temperature expansion of the free energy.

  is suggested by the renor-

the existence of a quark gluon plasma phase in which
quarks and gluons are weakly interacting degrees of free-
dom at temperatures t >
malization group ow of the eective qcd coupling con-
stant and the analogy with the plasma phase of qed.
lattice simulations indicate that this phase transition is
rst order and for pure su (2) occurs at t 2
c  2.1 
string tension [1]. although qcd is asymptotically free,
the perturbative analysis of the high-temperature phase
is plagued by infrared (ir) divergences [2]. the best
one can presently achieve perturbatively at high tem-
peratures is a resummation of the infrared-safe contri-
butions [3]. the situation is somewhat embarrassing,
since one naively might hope that an asymptotically free
theory allows for an accurate perturbative description of
the high temperature phase. the ir-problem encoun-
tered in the perturbative high temperature expansion in
fact is part of the more general problem of dening a
non-abelian gauge-xed theory on a compact euclidean
space-time without boundaries, such as a hypertorus. it
was shown [4] that normalizable zero-modes of the ghosts
cause the partition function to vanish in conventional co-
variant gauges. an equivariant brst construction was
used to eliminate these ghost zero-modes associated with
global gauge invariance at the expense of a non-local
quartic ghost interaction.
it was seen that this inter-
action leads to ghost-antighost condensation at arbitrar-
ily small coupling [4,5]. subsequently, the equivariant
gauge-xing procedure was successfully used to reduce
the structure group of an su (2) lattice gauge theory
(lgt) to a physically equivalent abelian lgt with a
u (1) structure group [6]. the equivariant brst sym-
metry of the partially gauge-xed lgt was proven to
be valid also non-perturbatively and the quartic ghost
interaction leads to ghost-antighost condensation in this
case too. the starting point of this investigation is a
transcription of this partially gauge-xed su(2)-lgt to

the continuum using the equivariant brst algebra. a
partially gauge-xed lgt together with a corresponding
critical continuum model that are dened by the same
brst algebra is perhaps of some interest.

we will see that ghost-antighost condensation also
occurs at arbitrarily small coupling in the continuum
model and leads to propagators that are regular at eu-
clidean momenta for all elds except the abelian pho-
ton. screening masses in a certain sense thus arise
naturally in an su (2) gauge theory in covariant abelian
gauges. they cure the ir-problem of the perturbative
sceleton expansion for the free energy.

the critical continuum action of the lattice model [6] in
euclidean space is uniquely specied by the brst alge-
bra, the eld content and power counting. decomposing
the non-abelian su(2) connection ~a = (w 1
 , a) in
terms of two real vector-bosons (or one complex one) and
a u(1)-connection a (the photon of the model), the
loop expansion is dened by the lagrangian,

l = linv. + lag + lagf .

with an obvious extension to include matter elds. con-
trary to most other proposals for mass generation [7,8]
the brst transformation eq. (6) is on-shell nilpotent on
the set of u (1)-invariant functionals: on functionals that
depend only on w, a, c and the matter elds, s2 eects
an innitesimal u(1)-transformation with the parame-
ter g
2 abcacb. the brst algebra eq. (6) thus denes
an equivariant cohomology and ensures the perturbative
renormalizability and unitarity [6,9] of the model. note
that the physical sector comprises states created by com-
posite operators of a, w and the matter elds in the
equivariant cohomology of s. they are brst closed and
u (1)-invariant. this has the interesting consequence that
even at the tree level, the ga
 operator does not create
 ga
asymptotic physical states  but the operator ga

does, because it is u (1)-invariant and sga
= 0.
since ga
 also has some overlap with gauge invariant
physical states for g 6= 0, the formal limit g  0 of the
physical hilbert space could be smooth.
the corresponding equivariant brst symmetry of the
lgt is valid also non-perturbatively [6] and expectation
values of physical observables of the corresponding u(1)-
lgt are the same as those of the original su (2)-lgt for
any  > 0. one may eliminate the auxiliary scalar eld
 by its equation of motion in favor of a 4-ghost interac-
tion proportional to . the form eq. (4) of the partial
gauge-xing term is, however, more convenient for what
follows. note that formally setting  = 0 and solving the
constraint f a = 0 as in [10] is not the same as taking the
limit   0. the reason is inherently non-perturbative
and nicely exhibited by the lattice calculation [6]: with-
out the quartic ghost interaction, gribov copies of a con-
guration conspire to give vanishing expectation values
for all physical observables. no matter how small, the
quartic ghost interaction is required to have a normaliz-
able partition function and expectation values of physical
observables that are identical with those of the original
su(2)-lgt.

lagf in eq. (1) has been added by hand to x the
remaining u (1) gauge invariance and dene the pertur-
bative series of the continuum model unambiguously. i
will assume a conventional covariant gauge-xing of the
u (1)-symmetry,

lagf =

however, none of the following conclusions depend on the
gauge-xing of the abelian subgroup  in particular they
are -independent.

perturbatively the cancellation between gribov copies
is observed only indirectly: we will see that the perturba-
tive expansion about a non-trivial solution hi = v 6= 0
of the gap equation

v

g2 =  abhca(x)cb(x)i(cid:12)(cid:12)<>=v

(8)

is much better behaved in the infrared. note that eq. (8)
is u (1)-invariant and therefore does not depend on the
u (1) gauge-xing eq. (7).
eq. (8) and its solutions
are furthermore brst invariant due to the last relation
in eq. (6). let us for the moment assume that a non-
trivial solution to eq. (8) exists in some gauge  and that
it corresponds to a unique global minimum of the eec-
tive action; we will examine this conjecture below. the
consequences for the ir-behavior of the model are dra-
matic. dening the quantum part (x) of the auxiliary
scalar  by

(x) = v + (x) with hi = 0 ,

the momentum representation of the euclidean ghost
propagator at tree level becomes

hcacbip =

p2ab + vab

p4 + v2

(10)

= z

d ep2

[ab cos(v) + ab sin(v)] .

the last line of eq. (10) is feynmans parameterization
of the propagator.
it shows that dimensional regular-
ization and the evaluation of perturbative loop integrals
with this propagator are only slightly more complicated
than usual. more importantly, the ghost propagator is
regular at euclidean momenta when v 6= 0. furthermore,
its complex conjugate poles at p2 = iv2 cannot be
interpreted as physical ghost states [11].
when v 6= 0, the w -boson is massless only at tree
w =

level and (see fig. 1) acquires the nite mass m2

fig. 1. the nite one-loop contribution to the w mass.

technically, the one-loop contribution is nite because
the integral in eq. (11) involves only the abp2/(p4+v2)-
part of the ghost propagator eq. (10). since p2/(p4 +
v2) = v2/(p2(p4 + v2)) + 1/p2, the v-dependence of
the loop integral is ir- and uv-nite. the quadratic uv-
divergence of the 1/p2 subtraction at v = 0 is canceled
by the other, v-independent, quadratically divergent one-
loop contributions  (in dimensional regularization this

scale-invariant integral vanishes by itself). m2
w further-
more is positive due to the overall minus sign of the ghost
loop. the sign of m2
w is crucial, for it indicates that the
model is stable and (as far as the loop expansion is con-
cerned) does not develop tachyonic poles at euclidean p2
for v 6= 0. conceptually, the local mass term proportional
to  ab is nite due to the brst symmetry eq. (6),
which excludes a mass counter-term. the latter argu-
ment implies that contributions to m2
w are nite to all
orders of the loop expansion.

fig. 2. (v, p2) to order g0.

if the model is stable at v 6= 0, the 1pi 2-point function
(v, p2) of the scalar must not vanish at euclidean p2
either. to order g0, (p2) is given by the 1/g2 term
that arises from eq. (4) upon substitution of eq. (9) and
the one-(ghost)-loop contribution shown in fig.2. since
a non-trivial solution to the gap equation eq. (8) relates
1/g2 to a loop integral of zeroth order in the coupling, we
may use eq. (8) to lowest order to obtain a tree-level
expression for (v, p2) of order g0. evaluating the loop
integrals, one obtains the real, positive and monotonic
function

(x :=

v2
p2

) = (cid:26)1 + 21  4ix acoth(1  4ix)

3221

(cid:27)

+ {x  x} .

(12)

the asymptotic behavior of eq. (12) for small and large
x (corresponding to large and small momenta) is
(x  0)  (1 + ln|x|)/(162) + o(x)
(x  )  (1 + 1/(60x2))/(162) + o(x4) . (13)
the mixing between  and a vanishes due to an
abelian ward identity. (p2  0)  /(162) to order
g0 thus establishes the perturbative stability of a non-
trivial solution to eq. (8) and the fact that this solution
is a minimum of the eective potential. note that 
diverges logarithmically for v  0 at nite .
an expansion about a solution v 6= 0 to the gap equa-
tion thus has lowest order propagators that are regular
at euclidean momenta for all the elds except the pho-
ton a (if all the matter elds are massive). the po-
larization of the photon vanishes at p2 = 0 due to the
u (1)-symmetry  regardless of the value of v. for v 6= 0
the situation is thus rather similar to qed with an un-
orthodox massive matter content (extending the notion
of massive matter to include ghosts and other unphys-
ical elds). but the perturbative expansion of the free
energy of qed does not suer from ir-divergences if all
the matter elds are massive [2]. since all the loop in-
tegrals of the sceleton expansion of the free energy are
infrared nite at a non-trivial solution to eq. (8), the
perturbation series is also free of ir-singularities in the

present case. a perturbative evaluation of the free energy
of this asymptotically free model thus is feasible and be-
comes accurate at high temperatures.

to complete the argument, we have to solve eq. (8) for
small coupling. to lowest order in the loop expansion,
the relation between the renormalized couplings g, , the
renormalization point  and an expectation value v 6= 0
implied by eq. (8) is

ln

v2
1624 = 

162
g2 + 2(1  e) + o(g2) .

(14)

the renormalization constant zv of the expectation value
is simultaneously found to be

z 2

v = 1 +

g22
162

(2  0) + o(g4) ,

(15)

where 0 is the lowest order coecient of the -function
of this model (0 = (22  2nf )/3 with nf quark avors
in the fundamental representation as matter).
using the relation between , g2 and the asymptotic

scale parameter m s, we may rewrite eq. (14) as

ln

g2 (cid:18) 2

(cid:19) + 2  ln() + o(ln g, g2) ,

(16)

apart from an anomalous dimension, the non-trivial so-
lution v at suciently small coupling is thus propor-
tional to the physical scale 2
in the particular gauge
 = 0/2. eq. (15) furthermore implies that the anoma-
lous dimension of v is of order g4 at  = 0/2. the
corrections of order ln g in eq. (16) thus also vanish in
this particular gauge and higher order corrections to the
asymptotic value of v at small g2 are analytic in g2. in
the gauge  = 0/2, one can expand the model about

m s

v2 =

e24

m s

(1 + o(g2))

(17)

and determine the analytic corrections in g2 to eq. (17)
order by order in the loop expansion of the gap equa-
tion eq. (8). i should emphasize that higher order cor-
rections to the lowest order solution eq. (14) of the gap
equation in other gauges are not analytic in g2. for
 6= 0/2, the non-analytic dependence of v on the cou-
pling in eq. (14) is modied by terms of comparable mag-
nitude in every order of the perturbative expansion: the
renormalization group equation implies that the leading-
log contribution to the gap equation at n > 1-loops is
proportional to (2  0)g2n2(ln v2/4)n and vanishes
only if the one-loop anomalous dimension of v does. at
 = 0/2 the corrections to eq. (14) from higher loops
are suppressed by at least one order of g2 and the lowest
order solution eq. (17) remains accurate to order g2 at
any nite order of the loop expansion. this does not im-
ply that other gauges are any less physical, but it does

3

single out  = 0/2 as the gauge in which a perturba-
tive evaluation of the gap equation eq. (8) is consistent
at suciently small values of g2. (in qed the hydro-
gen spectrum to lowest order is most readily found in
coulomb gauge, although it evidently does not depend
on the chosen gauge. in the present case asymptotic free-
dom allows us to determine an optimal gauge for solving
the gap equation.)

at the one-loop level, eq. (8) has a unique non-trivial
solution in any gauge  6= 0 and we know from 
of eq. (12) that it corresponds to a minimum of the one-
loop action. in the limit   0 at nite coupling, the
non-trivial one-loop solution eq. (14) coincides with the
trivial one. on the other hand, some of the couplings
in the non-linear gauge-xing lag become large in this
limit, invalidating the perturbative analysis.
to gain some insight into the highly singular behav-
ior of the model when   0, i calculated the divergent
part of the w self-energy to one loop. the correspond-
ing renormalization constants zw and z of the wave-
function and the gauge parameter are

zw = 1 +

z = 1

(18)

there is no non-renormalization theorem for the gauge-
xing term in these non-linear gauges and the ward iden-
tities of this model do not imply zw = z. note that the
gauge dependent interaction terms proportional to g/ at
one loop give rise to a term of order g2/2 in the longitu-
dinal part of the w self-energy only. the transverse part
of the w self-energy is regular in the limit   0. taking
 to vanish thus is rather tricky: eq. (18) implies that
the longitudinal part of the w -propagator at one loop
is proportional to 3g2p2 ln(p2) at large momenta and no
longer vanishes in this limit. higher order loop correc-
tions similarly contribute to the longitudinal propagator
as   0. z does not depend on the gauge parameter
 at one loop, due to an abelian ward identity that re-
lates the longitudinal part of the w w a-vertex to the w
self-energy. the same abelian ward identity also gives
the qed-like relation [10] za = z 2
g = z between the
renormalization constants of the photon wave function,
of the coupling constant g and of the gauge parameter .
from eq. (18) we have that the anomalous dimension

of the gauge parameter  to order g2

is negative for nite g2 and positive values of  when
0 < 6 + 23. with  < 0, the eective gauge param-
eter tends to decrease at higher renormalization scales 
and direct integration of eq. (19) gives a vanishing  at

4

a nite value of the coupling g2. as already noted above,
the loop calculation is, however, valid only if g2  1 and
g2/  1. eq. (19) nevertheless shows that there is no
nite uv xed point for the gauge parameter and that
 eectively vanishes at least as fast as g2 as   
for any gauge at nite g2. eq. (17) nevertheless is the
asymptotic solution to eq. (8) in the sense that it is
valid at arbitrary small coupling if one chooses the gauge
at that coupling to be (g) = 0/2. this is compatible
with the asymptotic vanishing of the eective gauge pa-
rameter only if higher order corrections to eq. (15) lead
to an anomalous dimension of v that eectively remains
of order g4 even as g, (g)  0. since the gauge sec-
tor becomes strongly coupled when g2/(g) is o(1) and
the loop expansion does not give the correct behavior of
eq. (15) in this limit, this is at least conceivable.

let me nally state that the non-trivial solution to the
gap equation persists to arbitrarily high temperatures,
because the (unique) non-trivial solution at t = 0 is a
consequence of the scale anomaly [5] and does not break
an internal symmetry. the renormalization point depen-
dence of eq. (14) and the associated uv-divergence of
the loop integral are an indication of this. the character
of the solution to eq. (8) does, however, change dramat-
ically with temperature [12]. at low temperatures v(t )
deviates only marginally from eq. (17), whereas at high
temperatures v(t  )  t 2/ ln2 (t /).
