1 introduction

supersymmetry (often abbreviated as susy) maps particles and elds of integer spin
(bosons) into particles and elds of half odd integer spin (fermions) and vice versa. super-
symmetry was introduced in quantum eld theory in [1] (for textbooks, see [2]). super-
symmetry is a continuous space-time symmetry, generated by a supercharge q, which is
a fermionic space-time spinor operator of spin 1/2. as such, q commutes with the usual
local and global internal symmetries, such as color and avor symmetries,

[q, internal charges] = 0 .

(1.1)

as a result, in a supersymmetric theory, the spectrum is arranged in pairs (boson, fermion),
where the boson and fermion have the same internal quantum numbers and the same mass.
in the present lectures, we shall concentrate on yang-mills theories, which are built
out of particles and elds of spins at most equal to 1. thus, we shall not deal with theories
of gravity which contain also particles and elds of spins larger than 1. before reviewing
the structure of the spectrum and of the interactions of supersymmetric theories, we shall
briey explain why supersymmetry is an important and integral part of modern particle
physics already today and is expected to become so even more in the near future.

1.1 supersymmetry and the standard model

all the particle physics that we know of today is described to stunning accuracy by the
particle contents and by the interactions of the standard model. the particle contents is
given in table 1; all particles have been observed, except for the higgs.

the interactions between the spin 1 particles and quarks and leptons are dictated by
the gauge invariance of the standard model, su(3)c  su(2)l  u(1)y . to each of the
factors of the gauge group, there is an independent coupling constant, denoted by g3, g2
and g1. the ne structure constant , familiar from electromagnetism, and the weak
mixing angle w are combinations of the couplings g2 and g1.

however,

by inspection of the particle spectrum of the standard model, it is immediate that
there is not a single candidate for a supersymmetric pair of particles. thus, it would
appear at rst sight that supersymmetry has no useful place in particle physics, since the
most basic characteristic of a supersymmetric theory is not realized in the standard model.
in nature, symmetries are often spontaneously broken. this means that
the laws of physics are invariant under a symmetry, but the solution of the equations
(such as the ground state of the theory) is not invariant under this symmetry. this
situation is familiar from the standard model itself and occurs in all three sectors of
the theory. in the su(3)c or quantum chromodynamics (qcd) sector, the spontaneous
breaking of approximate chiral symmetry for the up and down quarks is responsible for the
comparatively small masses of the pions, as well as for the comparatively large masses of
the nucleons. (this eect is discussed in detail in the ban lectures of frank wilczek [3].)
in the su(2)l  u(1)y sector, the spontaneous breaking of su(2) is responsible for the
masses of quarks, leptons, w  and z particles, as well as for the emergence of unbroken
electromagnetic u(1)em.

thus, by analogy with mechanisms familiar from the standard model, we should expect
that also supersymmetry may be spontaneously broken if realized at all in nature. in the
generic mechanisms of supersymmetry breaking, the spectrum continues to be organized
in pairs of bosons and fermions with equal quantum numbers, but the mass of the fermion
is dierent from the mass of the boson of the pair.

considering now pairs of fermions and bosons, but allowing for unequal masses, as is
typical of spectra with spontaneously broken supersymmetry, we see that the standard
model still exhibits no candidates for such pairs, and thus displays no room for supersym-
metry to operate, even if spontaneously broken. to have any chance at all of realizing
supersymmetry, even spontaneously broken, the particle spectrum of the standard model
must be extended. the minimal way of doing this, via the introduction of the smallest
number of supplementary particles, is called the minimal supersymmetric standard model.
basically, for each currently known or non-supersymmetric particle, we supply a hypothet-
ical supersymmetric partner. there is one exception : supersymmetry requires at least
two higgs elds. the spectrum is schematically exhibited in table 2.

actually, the existence of super partners in supersymmetric theories is one of the most
dramatic and most general predictions that follows from the assumption that supersym-
metry has anything to do with nature at all. bold as the assumption of this extension of
the particle spectrum may be, this is not the rst time in the history of particle physics
that the number of degrees of freedom associated with an elementary particle is doubled
up, as schematically shown in the diagram below for the case of the electron

thompson electron = + spin = + positron = + susy partner .

the precise mechanism by which supersymmetry is to be broken is not well understood
at present. by analogy with qcd, the mechanism may be inherently non-perturbative,
but we do not know for a fact that this is the case.

1.2 supersymmetry and unication of forces

the supersymmetric extension of the standard model, in which a hypothetical super-
symmetric partner is included for each known particle, has appeared in a rather ad-hoc
fashion. the full signicance of supersymmetry really emerges only when the principle
of supersymmetry is considered in conjunction with the principle of the unication of the
strong, electro-magnetic and weak forces (and most likely also gravity).

remarkably, the standard model automatically contains a new scale at energies of
order 1015 gev . it is surprising to nd such a high energy scale in the model, since the
masses of the quarks, leptons and gauge bosons are on the order of or smaller than the
electro-weak scale of about 250 gev . to see how this new scale emerges, one must take
into account the eect of renormalization of the three couplings gi, i = 1, 2, 3. (see for
example [4].) as the typical energy or mass scale  of a physical process is altered, the
couplings gi vary according to the renormalization group equations, whose lowest order
solutions are given by

4
g2
i ()

=

bi
2

ln


i

i = 1, 2, 3 .

(1.2)

here, bi are numerical constants, dependent on the gauge group and on the matter contents,
and i are integration constants; we shall not need their explicit values here. the couplings
have been measured to very high accuracy at the scale of the mass of the z particle  = mz,
where [5]

g1(mz)  0.46 < g2(mz)  0.64 < g3(mz)  1.22

(1.3)

these values determine the integration constants i for given bi.

the couplings g2 and g3 are asymptotically free, i.e. their values decrease as the energy
scale is increased because b2, b3 > 0. now, at low energies, the strong coupling g3 is larger
than g2, and since b3 > b2, the coupling g3 will decrease faster than g2. also, the coupling

6

g1 is not asymptotically free and increases as the energy scale is increased because b1 < 0.
from these general considerations, it is not surprising that the couplings gi will mutually
intersect as the energy scale is raised.

remarkably however, all three couplings gi() approximately intersect in one point
around mu  1015 gev . even more remarkably, this scale is only a few orders of magni-
tude below perhaps the most primary scale in physics, the planck scale mp  1019 gev at
which quantum gravity is supposed to become important. adopting the philosophy that
such a remarkable coincidence cannot be merely an accident and must have a fundamental
physical meaning, we are led to interpret the scale mu , where the three couplings approx-
imately meet, as a scale where the three dierent forces are unied into a single one. a
unied theory will be governed by a simple gauge group. the smallest such group which
contains the gauge group of the standard model as a subgroup is su(5), but the inclusion
of a massive neutrino can be realized only in the larger so(10), and string theory might
favor a sequence all the way up to the maximal exceptional group e8,

su(3)c  su(2)l  u(1)y  su(5)  so(10)  e6  e8 .

(1.4)

starting at the highest energy scales, just below mp , and running down to lower energy
scales, there will initially be only a single force, governed by the unied simple gauge
group. the strong, electromagnetic and weak interactions will emerge as the result of a
phase transition at the unication scale mu , where the unied gauge symmetry is broken
down to the su(3)csu(2)lu(1)y gauge group. if the breaking of the gauge symmetry
occurs in successive stages, various intermediate breaking scales will also emerge.

the unication scheme is attractive for a number of additional reasons.

 the abelian gauge interactions u(1)y and u(1)em are not asymptotically free and the
gauge couplings g1 and  grow indenitely as the energy scale is increased. it is usually
argued that this behavior leads to a landau ghost, thus to a failure of unitarity at high
energies and ultimately to an inconsistency of the theory. in the unication schemes where
the u(1) gauge group arises from the breaking of an asymptotically free gauge theory with
simple gauge group, this problem is automatically avoided, because the dynamics of the
asymptotically simple group will take over at suciently large energies.
 the particle spectrum of the standard model without right handed neutrino ts eco-
nomically in three family copies of the 5  10 of su(5), while the spectrum including the
right handed neutrino ts precisely in three family copies of the 16 spinor representation
of so(10). in view of the recent experimental results on neutrino masses and oscillations,
the so(10) scheme is denitely the preferred one.

however, the unication scheme also has some fundamental problems.

 the additional gauge bosons can mediate baryon number violating transitions, and the
proton life-time comes out around 1029 years, many orders of magnitude shorter than the
present experimental bounds of around 1033 years. (see for example [6].)

7

 as the fundamental scale in the unication models is now large and on the order
of 1015 gev , it becomes an issue as to how the comparatively small mass scales of the
electro-weak gauge bosons and the quarks and leptons come about. this is called the
hierarchy problem. the principles of quantum eld theory guarantee that these masses are
free parameters, so in principle they could be adjusted by hand to be small. this requires
an absurd degree of ne tuning of the various couplings in the theory, and is usually viewed
as unnatural.
 finally, the three gauge couplings g1, g2 and g3 meet only approximately in a single
point. with the high precision data made available by the study of the z-particle and
its decays, we now know that strictly within the scenario of the standard model and its
extrapolation to high energies, the three couplings will not intersect at one point.

the supersymmetric extension of the standard model, combined with the principle
of unication of strong, electro-magnetic and weak forces supplies radical solutions to the
above problems.
 the supersymmetric extension of the so(10) unied theory provides perfect intersection
of the couplings g1, g2 and g3 at msu  1016 gev . the running of the gauge couplings
depends only very slightly upon the scale and mechanism of supersymmetry breaking. the
result quoted here is obtained generically when the susy breaking scale is on the order of
the electro-weak scale of 100 gev .
 the proton life-time for the su(5) or so(10) supersymmetric unied theories is now
much longer (in part because the unication scale is an order of magnitude larger in the
supersymmetric theories) and estimated to be on the order of 3  1033 years. this result
is tantalizingly close to the present day bounds for this number, and if supersymmetric
unied theories are viable, we may expect to see proton decay within our life-time.
 the hierarchy and ne-tuning problems are dramatically reduced. the smallness of
fermion masses is naturally protected by chiral symmetries. in generic non-supersymmetric
theories, the smallness of boson masses is not protected and contributions to the boson
mass quadratic in the cuto scale tend to drive boson masses towards the largest scale
in the theory. in exactly supersymmetric theories, bosons and fermions are degenerate,
so supersymmetry together with chiral symmetry will also protect the smallness of boson
masses.
in more realistic theories, where supersymmetry is broken (explicitly or spon-
taneously) at a scale of mb, the smallness of boson masses will be naturally protected
up to the supersymmetry breaking scale. the idea being that above this breaking scale,
supersymmetry is exact for all practical purposes, and boson and fermion masses above
this scale will be degenerate.
 finally, the argument of the previous point may be turned around and used to provide a
rough estimate of the supersymmetry breaking scale. if supersymmetry is to protect boson
masses up to the electro-weak scale, then the supersymmetry breaking scale cannot be too

8

much larger than the electro-weak breaking scale, otherwise supersymmetry will cease to
resolve the hierarchy and ne-tuning problems. including lower bounds from present day
experiments on supersymmetric particles, we obtain the challenging range

100 gev  susy breaking scale  1000 gev .

(1.5)

as experiments confront energy scales larger than the susy breaking scale, one may natu-
rally expect to nd a wealth of supersymmetric partners. remarkably, if the above scheme
is borne out in nature, the experimental discovery of supersymmetry may not be far o
in the future !

1.3 supersymmetric yang-mills dynamics

in view of the remarkable conuence of circumstancial evidence pointing towards a super-
symmetric extension of the standard model, it has become a priority in particle physics
to understand better the perturbative and non-perturbative dynamics of supersymmet-
ric gauge theories and their spontaneous breaking. over the past few years, substantial
progress has been made in the understanding of the non-perturbative dynamics of yang-
mills theory with extended supersymmetry, namely n = 2 and n = 4. on the one hand,
by generalizing montonen-olive [7] duality, seiberg and witten [8] obtained the exact
low energy eective action as well as the exact spectrum of bps states of n = 2 super
yang-mills theory (with su(2) gauge group) and established that the dynamics is always
that of a coulomb phase. on the other hand, by analyzing d3-brane congurations [9]
in certain limits, maldacena [10] arrived at an equivalence conjecture between type iib
superstring theory on ads5  s5 and n = 4 superconformal yang-mills theory. assuming
this equivalence, further conjectures, purely on n = 4 super yang-mills, have emerged,
suggesting an extensive degree of non-renormalization [11] perhaps beyond that required
by the n = 4 supersymmetry alone [12]. while it is unlikely that n = 4 super yang-mills
is completely integrable in the sense of 2-dimensional models, both developments men-
tioned above suggest that the theory may be integrable in restricted sense. while these
developments are impressive, the physically most pressing questions such as the dynamics
of supersymmetry breaking remain only partially under control to this date.

the purpose of the present lectures is to present an introduction to 4-dimensional
supersymmetric gauge theories, including those with extended supersymmetry, as well as
to the seiberg-witten non-perturbative solutions. remarkably, these solutions possess
a natural and extremely useful mapping onto integrable systems in classical mechanics,
a subject to which we also present a review. finally, the map onto integrable systems,
in particular onto toda and calogero-moser systems, is used to give a seiberg-witten
construction for general gauge algebras and a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation
of the gauge algebra (a theory obtained from n = 4 super yang-mills by adding a mass
term to the hypermultiplet).

2 supersymmetric yang-mills in 4 dimensions

we begin by reviewing the particle and eld contents and the construction of lagrangians
invariant under supersymmetry for spins less or equal to 1. for textbooks see [2].

2.1 supersymmetry algebra

poincare symmetry is generated by the translations r4 and lorentz transformations
so(3, 1), with generators p and l respectively. (here and below, ,  = 0, 1, 2, 3.) the
complexied lorentz group is isomorphic to su(2)su(2), and its nite-dimensional rep-
resentations are usually labeled by two positive (or zero) half integers (s+, s), s  z/2.
2 , 1
scalar, 4-vector, and rank 2 symmetric tensors transform under (0, 0), ( 1
2) and (1, 1)
respectively, left and right chirality fermions transform under ( 1
2, 0) and (0, 1
2 ) respectively,
and selfdual and anti-selfdual rank 2 anti-symmetric tensors transform under (1, 0) and
(0, 1) respectively.

supersymmetry enlarges the poincare algebra by including spinor supercharges,

the algebra. the supercharges transform as weyl spinors of so(3, 1), and are translation
invariant, so that [p, qi

spinor notation by

qi = (cid:18) qi

q 



0 (cid:19)

(2.4)

by construction, the generators z ij are anti-symmetric in the indices i and j, and com-
mute with all generators of the supersymmetry algebra. for the last reason, the z ij are
usually referred to as central charges, and we have

z ij = z ji

[z ij, anything] = 0 .
note that for n = 1, the anti-symmetry of z implies that z = 0.
the supersymmetry algebra is left invariant under a global phase rotation of all super-
charges qi
, forming a group u(1)r. in addition, when n > 1, the dierent supercharges
may be rotated into one another under a unitary transformation, belonging to su(n )r.
these (automorphism) symmetries of the supersymmetry algebra are called r-symmetries.
in quantum eld theories, part or all of these r-symmetries may be broken by anomaly
eects.

2.2 massless particle representations

to study massless representations, we choose a lorentz frame in which the momentum
takes the form p  = (e, 0, 0, e), e > 0. the susy algebra relation (2.2) then reduces to

{qi

)} = 2(p) i

2 = 0, z ij = 0 .

(2.7)

the relation qi
2 = 0 follows because the left hand side of (2.7) implies that the norm of
2|i vanishes for any state |i in the hilbert space. the relation z ij = 0 then follows
qi
from (2.2) for  = 2 and  = 1. the remaining supercharge operators are

 qi

1 which lowers helicity by 1/2;

1 = (qi

1 and (qi

1), with i = 1,   ,n form a representation of dimension 2n of the

cliord algebra associated with the lie algebra so(2n ). all the states in the representa-
tion may be obtained by starting from the highest helicity state |hi and applying products
of qi
1 operators for all possible values of i.
here, we shall only be interested in cpt invariant theories, such as quantum eld
theories and string theories, for which the particle spectrum must be symmetric under a
sign change in helicity. if the particle spectrum obtained as a cliord representation in
the above fashion is not already cpt self-conjugate, then we shall take instead the direct
sum with its cpt conjugate. for helicity  1, the spectra are listed in table 3. the n = 3
and n = 4 particle spectra then coincide, and the quantum eld theories are identical.

2.3 massive particle representations

for massive particle representations, we choose the rest frame with p  = (m, 0, 0, 0), so
that the rst set of susy algebra structure relations takes the form

{qi

(2.8)

to deal with the full susy algebra, it is convenient to make use of the su(n ) r-symmetry
to diagonalize in blocks of 2  2 the anti-symmetric matrix z ij = z ji. to do so, we
split the label i into two labels : i = (a, i) where a = 1, 2 and i = 1,   , r, where n = 2r
for n even (and we append a further single label when n is odd). we then have

z = diag(z1,   , zr, #)

in any unitary particle representation, the operator on the left hand side of (2.10) must be

m  |zi|

i = 1,   , r = (cid:20)n

(2.11)

whenever one of the values |zi| equals m, the bps bound is (partially) saturated and
either the supercharge qi
 must vanish. the supersymmetry representation then
suers multiplet shortening. more precisely, if we have m = |zi| for i = 1,   , ro, and
m > |zi| for all other values of i, the susy algebra is eectively a cliord algebra associated
with so(4n  2ro), the corresponding representation is said to be 1/2ro bps, and has
dimension 22nro.

2.4 field contents of supersymmetric field theories

the analysis of the preceding two subsections has revealed that the supersymmetry particle
representations for 1  n  4, with spin less or equal to 1, simply consist of customary
spin 1 vector particles, spin 1/2 fermions and spin 0 scalars. correspondingly, the elds
in supersymmetric theories with spin less or equal to 1 are customary spin 1 gauge elds,1
spin 1/2 weyl fermion elds and spin 0 scalar elds, but these elds are restricted to enter
in multiplets of the relevant supersymmetry algebras. here, we shall need only the n = 2
bps gauge eld, instead of the full n = 2 gauge multiplet, and henceforth we shall restrict
to this case.

let g denote the gauge algebra, associated with a compact lie group g. then, two
kinds of multiplets occur. for any 1  n  4, we have a gauge multiplet, which transforms
under the adjoint representation of g. for n = 3, 4, this is the only possible multiplet.
furthermore, the quantum eld theories with n = 3 supersymmetry turn out to coincide
with those with n = 4 supersymmetry in view of cpt invariance. thus, we shall limit
our discussion to the n = 4 theories, as is customarily done. for n = 1 and n = 2, we
also have matter multiplets : for n = 1, this is the chiral multiplet, and for n = 2 this is
the hypermultiplet, both of which may transform under an arbitrary (unitary, and possibly
reducible) representation r of g.

we shall now briey discuss each of these eld multiplets in terms of their components,
which are the customary gauge eld a, left weyl fermions  and  and scalar elds 
and h. (the notation is conventional.) a dirac fermion d is the direct sum of a left and
right weyl fermion d = ( ), while a majorana (or real) fermion m is a dirac fermion
with  =  : m = ( ). in 4 space-time dimensions, a majorana fermion is equivalent
to a weyl fermion.

 n = 1 gauge multiplet (a ), where  is the gaugino majorana fermion;
 n = 1 chiral multiplet ( ), where  is a left weyl fermion and  a complex

scalar, in the representation r of g.

 n = 2 gauge multiplet (a  ), where  form a dirac fermion, and  is the
complex gauge scalar. under the su(2)r symmetry of n = 2 supersymmetry, the
elds a and  are singlets, while the elds + and  transform as a doublet.

 n = 2 hypermultiplet (+ h +), where  form a dirac spinor and h are
complex scalars, transforming under the representation r of g. under the su(2)r
symmetry,  are singlets, while h+ and h transform as a doublet.

 n = 4 gauge multiplet (a a

 , a = 1, 2, 3, 4 are left weyl fermions
(equivalent to two dirac fermions) and i, i = 1,   , 6 are real scalars (equivalent

 i), where a

to three complex scalars). under the su(4)r symmetry of n = 4 supersymmetry,
the gauge eld a is a singlet, the fermions a
 transform in the fundamental 4, the
scalars i transform in the rank 2 anti-symmetric 6.

it is very useful to record the transformation properties and representation contents

under supersymmetry subalgebras of the n = 2 and n = 4 supersymmetry algebras,

 (n = 2 gauge) = (n = 1 gauge)  (n = 1 chiral in adjoint rep. of g);
 (n = 2 hyper) = (n = 1 chiral)  (n = 1 chiral in complex conjugate rep.);
 (n = 4 gauge) = (n = 2 gauge)  (n = 2 hyper in adjoint rep. of g).

we conclude by remarking that all of the above multiplets are parity self-conjugate, except
for the n = 1 chiral multiplet, since it is built out of a single left weyl fermion.

2.5 n=1 supersymmetric lagrangians

lagrangians invariant under supersymmetry are just customary lagrangians of gauge, spin
1/2 fermion and scalar elds, (these elds are arranged in multiplets of the supersymmetry
algebra, as established previously) with certain special relations amongst the coupling
constants and masses. we begin with the construction of lagrangians invariant under the
smallest degree of supersymmetry, namely n = 1. for our purposes, the lagrangians of
interest are of two restricted kinds

 (1) renormalizable n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories;
 (2) more general low energy eective n = 1 supersymmetric theories, with the
property that any monomial term in the lagrangian has a total of no more than two
derivatives on all boson elds and no more than one derivative on all fermion elds.
such restricted lagrangian may be viewed as describing phenomena in the limit of
low energy and momenta, and are well familiar from soft pion physics.

in 4 space-time dimensions, all lagrangians in group (1) automatically belong in group
(2). thus, we seek to construct all lagrangians in (2).

we consider rst the case of only the n = 1 gauge multiplet (a ), and proceed by
writing down all possible gauge invariant polynomial terms of dimension 4 using minimal
coupling. one nds

where g is the gauge coupling,  is the instanton angle, the eld strength is f = a

remarkably, l is automatically invariant under the n = 1 supersymmetry transformations

a = i   i
 = f

(2.13)

where  is a spin 1/2 valued innitesimal supersymmetry parameter. note that the addi-
tion in (2.12) of a majorana mass term m for  would spoil supersymmetry.

unfortunately, as soon as scalar elds are to be included, such as is the case when
dealing with chiral multiplets, it is no longer so easy to guess supersymmetry invariant
lagrangians. for example, for a single chiral multiplet ( ) already, the restricted case
(1) of just renormalizable lagrangians is much more involved and much less intuitive. we
quote here the result and shall leave the derivation of this case as well as of the more
general ones for the next subsections. we have

where u() is forced by n = 1 supersymmetry to be a complex analytic (holomorphic)
scalar function of , called the superpotential. renormalizability furthermore restricts u
to be a polynomial of degree no larger than 3 : u() = u0 + u1 + u22 + u33. here, ui
are complex coupling constants, with u3 specifying both the scalar quartic self-coupling
and yukawa coupling, and u2 specifying both the scalar and fermion masses.

2.6 n=1 supereld methods

generally, the construction of invariants is highly facilitated by the use of tensor-type
methods, in which all elds which transform linearly into one another are assembled into
a single multiplet. such methods are familiar from the construction of lorentz invariants
or gauge invariants.

the construction of eld multiplets containing all elds that transform linearly into one
another under supersymmetry presents a new challenge, because such multiplets must hold
simultaneously bosonic and fermionic elds. to achieve such superpositions of commuting
bose elds and anti-commuting fermi elds consistently with lorentz invariance, requires
the introduction of new anti-commuting spin 1/2 parameters or coordinates. for n = 1
supersymmetry, we introduce a (constant) left weyl spinor coordinate  and its complex
conjugate   = (), satisfying

[x, ] = [x,  ] = {, } = {,  } = { ,  } = 0 .

(2.15)

often,  and  are regarded as additional space-time coordinates on the same footing as
the customary coordinate x, which together then parametrize superspace.

z d2  = z d2    = z d4    = 1

for general notations and conventions for spinors and their contractions, see appendix a.
a supereld is dened as a general function of the superspace coordinates x, ,  .
since the square of each  or of each   vanishes, superelds admit nite taylor expansions
in powers of  and . thus, the most general supereld s(x, , ) yields the following
component expansion

s(x, , ) = (x) + (x) +  (x) + a(x) + f (x) +  g(x)

+i (x)  i (x) +

(2.20)

naturally, in quantum eld theory, one restricts to superelds that are either bosonic or
fermionic, so that the supereld has denite (anti-) commutation relations with  and ,

bosonic supereld

fermionic supereld

[s, ] = [s,  ] = 0
{s, } = {s,  } = 0 .

(2.21)

thus, if s is bosonic, the component elds , a, f , g and d are bosonic as well, while
the elds , ,  and  are fermionic. on the other hand, if s is fermionic, the component
elds , a, f , g and d are fermionic as well, while the elds , ,  and  are bosonic.
mathematically, the superelds belong to a z2 graded algebra of functions on superspace,
with the even grading associated with bosonic elds and the odd grading asssociated with
fermionic elds. we shall denote the grading by g(s).

superderivatives on superelds satisfy the following graded dierentiation rule

d(s1s2) = (ds1)s2 + ()g(s1)g(s2)s1(ds2)
d (s1s2) = (d s1)s2 + ()g(s1)g(s2)s1(d s2) ,

(2.22)

16

where g(si) is the grading of the eld si.

the only elementary superelds we shall need here are bosonic and they have the
property that the zero-th order term, the eld (x), is a lorentz scalar. we shall also
encounter a composite fermionic supereld, whose rst component is a spinor, and which
is associated with the gauge eld strength. if s is a bosonic scalar supereld, then , f ,
g, d are scalars while ,  ,  are left-handed weyl spinors, and a is a gauge eld.

on superelds, supersymmetry transformations are naturally realized in a linear way
via super-dierential operators (just as on ordinary elds, translations and lorentz trans-
formations are realized in a linear way via dierential operators). the innitesimal super-
symmetry parameter is still a constant left weyl spinor , as in (2.13) and we have

with the supercharges deend by

s = (q +  q)s

q =


  i

 

 

q  = 


   + i

 

(2.23)

(2.24)

the super-dierential operators d and q dier only by a sign change, and generate left
and right actions of supersymmetry respectively. their relevant structure relations are

{q, q } = 2

 p

{d, d } = 2

 p

(2.25)

where p = i. since left and right actions mutually commute, all 4 components of d
anti-commute with all 4 components of q : {q, d} = {q, d } = 0, and their complex
conjugate relations. further useful relations are that the product of any three ds or any
three qs vanishes,

ddd = qqq = 0

(2.26)

as well as their complex conjugate relations.

2.7

irreducible superelds of n=1

the type of supereld introduced above is in general highly reducible, and the irreducible
components may be found by imposing supersymmetric conditions on the supereld.

(a) the chiral supereld  is obtained by imposing the condition

d  = 0 .

(2.27)

the anti-chiral supereld  is obtained by imposing d = 0. these conditions are
invariant under the supersymmetry transformations of (2.23) since d or d and q or q
anti-commute. equation (2.27) may be solved in terms of the composite coordinates

 = x  i ,

normalization)

(x, , ) = (x+) + 2(x+) + f (x+)
(x, , ) = (x) + 2 (x) +  f (x)

(2.30)

the component elds  and  are the scalar and left weyl spinor elds of the chiral
multiplet respectively, as discussed previously. the eld f has not appeared previously.
the eld equation for f is always algebraic, so that f is a non-dynamical or auxiliary eld
of the chiral multiplet.

(b) the vector supereld is obtained by imposing the condition

v = v 

(2.31)

on a general supereld of the type (2.20). this condition sets  = , g = f and  =  in
(2.20), and requires that the elds , a and d be real. it is conventional to use a specic
notation for vector superelds and it is convenient to dene its expansion by

v (x, , ) = v(x) + (x) +  (x) + f (x) +  f(x) + a(x)

+i ((x) +

(2.32)

the advantage of the shifts by derivatives in the elds will become clear shortly.

the gauge supereld is a special case of a vector supereld. on a single (abelian)
vector supereld v , the reality condition v  = v is preserved upon addition of a chiral
supereld  and its complex conjugate , as follows,

v  v  = v + i  i .

(2.33)

(below, we shall assume that  has the same component eld decomposition as  in (2.30),
in order to save on some notation.) under this transformation, the component elds 
and d of v are unchanged, v,  and f transform in a purely algebraic way,

v  v = v + i  i
   =  + i2
f  f = f + if

18

(2.34)

while the eld a transforms as an abelian gauge eld

a  a = a + ( + ) .

(2.35)

thus, it is natural to view (2.33) as the supereld generalization of a gauge transformation
on an abelian gauge supereld v .

the non-abelian generalization of the gauge eld is such that v takes values in the lie
algebra g of the gauge group g (or equivalently transforms under the adjoint representation
of g) and that the transformation (2.33) is replaced by the following non-linear gauge
transformation law,
(2.36)

= ei

ev ei .

ev  ev 

which again preserves the reality condition v  = v , assuming that  is a chiral supereld
transforming under the adjoint representation of the gauge algebra g.

as is clear from (2.34), (and an analogous result holds for the non-abelian case), the
component elds v,  and f may be gauged away in an algebraic way, without implying
any dynamical constraints. the gauge in which this is achieved is called the wess-zumino
gauge, and is almost always imposed when performing practical calculations in the su-
pereld formulation. what remains is the gauge supereld in wess-zumino gauge, given
by

v (x,  ) = a(x) + i (x)  i (x) +

1
2

  d(x)

(2.37)

the component elds a and  are the gauge and gaugino elds of the gauge multiplet
respectively, as discussed previously. the eld d has not appeared previously and is an
auxiliary eld, just as f was an auxiliary eld for the chiral multiplet.

the role of the auxiliary elds f and d in the supereld formalism is to provide a
linearization of the supersymmetry transformations, as well as to allow for an o-shell
realization on the elds of the supersymmetry algebra, as given in (2.23).

working out the supersymmetry transformation (2.23) on chiral and vector superelds
in terms of components, we see that the only contribution to the auxiliary elds is from
the  term of q and thus takes the form of a total derivative. however, because the form
(2.37) was restricted to a wess-zumino gauge, f and d transform by a total derivative
only if f and d are themselves gauge singlets, in which case we have

f = i2( )
d = (i   i) .

(2.38)

(2.39)

(for non-gauge singlet auxiliary elds, the transformation laws will involve in addition non-
total-derivative terms; we shall not need their expressions here.) these transformation
properties guarantee that the f and d auxiliary elds yield supersymmetric invariant

19

lagrangian terms. thus, we have two dierent ways of building terms for an invariant
lagrangian,

f  terms
d  terms

lf = f = z d2 
ld =

d = z d4 v .

(2.40)

(2.41)

the rst starts from a chiral supereld  and the second from a vector supereld v .

2.8 general n=1 susy lagrangians via superelds

the f and d terms used to construct invariants in the previous subsection need not be
elementary elds, and may be gauge invariant composites of elementary elds instead.
allowing for this possibility, we may now derive the most general possible n = 1 invariant
lagrangian in terms of superelds. to do so, we need the following ingredients.

(1) any complex analytic function u depending only on left chiral superelds i (but

not on their complex conjugates) is itself a left chiral supereld,

d i = 0 = d u(i) = 0 .

(2.42)

thus, for any complex analytic function u, called the superpotential, we may construct an
invariant contribution to the lagrangian by forming an f -term

lu = z d2 u(i) + complex conjugate .

(2.43)

using the component expansion of (2.30), this lagrangian takes the component form

lu = xi

f i u

i 

1

2 xi,j

ij 2u

ij + complex conjugate

(2.44)

(2) actually, the gauge eld strength is a fermionic left chiral (spinor) supereld w,

which is constructed out of the gauge supereld v by

w = 

1
4

d d(ev de+v ) .

(2.45)

in view of (2.26), we automatically have d w = 0, so that w is chiral. decomposing
w in components, one nds

w(x, , ) = i(x+) + d(x+) 

i
2

()

f(x+) + 

 d (x+)

(2.46)

the gauge eld strength may be used as a chiral supereld along with elementary (scalar)
chiral superelds to build up n = 1 supersymmetric lagrangians via f -terms. in view of

20

our restriction to lagrangians with no more than two derivatives on bose elds, w can
enter at most quadratically. denoting by w a
 the components of the gauge multiplet, with
the index a running over the adjoint representation, we shall be interested in bilinears of
the form

in wess-zumino gauge. it is understood that all elds on the right hand side depend upon
the composite coordinate x

+ = x + i , just as was the case in (2.46).

elementary (scalar) chiral superelds may enter in any functional way without gener-
ating more than 2 derivatives. thus, the most general gauge kinetic and self-interaction
term is from the f -term of the gauge eld strength w and the elementary (scalar) chiral
superelds i as follows,

lg = z d2 ab(i)w aw b + complex conjugate .

(2.48)

here, a and b stand for the gauge index running over the adjoint representation of g. the
functions ab(i) are again required to be complex analytic. it is assumed that the function
ab(i) under suitable gauge transformations of i will transform under the symmetrized
square of the adjoint representation of g.

the gauge kinetic lagrangian may also be worked out in components, and is given by

(index summation over indices i, j and a, b are suppressed for the sake of brevity)

(3) the left and right chiral superelds i and (i), as well as the gauge supereld
v , may be combined into a gauge invariant vector supereld k(ev i, (i)), provided the
gauge algebra is realized linearly on the elds i. (for the general case, including when
part or all of the gauge group is realized non-linearly, see wess and bagger [2]; we shall
not need this case here.) the function k is called the kahler potential. assuming that
the gauge transformations  act on v by (2.36), the chiral superelds  transform as

   = ei ,

21

(2.50)

so that ev  transforms as . an invariant lagrangian may be constructed via a d-term,

lk = z d4k(ev i, (i)) .

(2.51)

upon expanding lk in components, one sees immediately that the leading terms are

lk  dd  i d ,

(2.52)

and thus already generates an action with two derivatives on boson elds. as a result, k
must be a function only of the superelds i and (i) and v , but not of their derivatives.

putting toghether contributions from lk, lu and lg, we have the most general n = 1

supersymmetric lagrangian with the restrictions of above.

2.9 renormalizable n=2,4 susy lagrangians

we shall now derive the lagrangians invariant under the larger supersymmetry algebras
associated with n = 2 and n = 4 supersymmetry. in this subsection, we shall restrict
attention to renormalizable lagrangians, leaving the general case for the next subsection.
thus, we seek an n = 2 microscopic renormalizable super-yang-mills theory with gauge
algebra g, and treat n = 4 as a special case thereof. following our general classication
of supersymmetry representations, two elds are possible. the gauge multiplet with com-
ponent elds (a  ) transforms under the adjoint representation of g, which we simply

22

denote by g, and the hypermultiplet with component elds (+ h ) transforms under
a representation r of g.

to construct the most general renormalizable lagrangian for these elds, we use our
results on invariant n = 1 supersymmetric lagrangians. to do so, we decompose the
n = 2 gauge and hypermultiplets under an n = 1 supersymmetry,

n = 2 gauge (rep g)
n = 2 hyper (rep r)

v  
:
: h1  h2

v  (a +)
h1  (h+ +)

  ( )
h2  (h )

(2.56)

(2.57)
and promote the n = 1 supermultiplets v , , h1 and h2 to n = 1 superelds by
including their respective auxiliary elds. thus, v may be viewed now as an n = 1 vector
(or gauge) superelds, while  and hf , f = 1, 2 may be viewed as n = 1 chiral superelds.
following the results of 2.8, we may immediately write down the most general n = 1
l = rez d2(cid:18) w aw a + u(, hf )(cid:19) +z d4(cid:18)evg  +xf

and g-gauge invariant lagrangian for these elds,

hf evrhf(cid:19)

(2.58)

here, vg and vr stand for the eld v in the representations g and r respectively. the
complex analytic function ab(, hf ) that was allowed for a general n = 1 supersymmetric
lagrangian must be constant for renormalizability, and equal to  ab by gauge invariance,
for a simple algebra g. the constant  is related to the gauge coupling g and the instanton
angle  by

(2.59)

the reality of g guarantees that im > 0. the superpotential u(, hf ) would be a general
g-invariant function for n = 1 supersymmetry, but for n = 2 is restricted to be of the
form
(2.60)

u(, ha) = h t
where m is the hypermultiplet mass matrix.

2.10 n=2 supereld methods : unconstrained superspace
in order to realize n = 2 susy transformations linearly on complete multiplets, we seek
a formulation in terms of superelds [13], just as for n = 1. the coordinates of n = 2
unconstrained superspace are collectively denoted zm , and given by

(2.61)
with [x, ] = {, } = 0 as usual. the internal su(2)r index i is raised or lowered with
the help of the anti-symmetric ij or ij tensor, where 12 = 12 = 1. unconstrained
superspace is real in the sense that it is invariant under the following complex conjugation

zm = {x, i,  i,

i = 1, 2} ,

(x) = x

(i) =  i .

(2.62)

an unconstrained supereld is dened as a general function of zm , with a taylor ex-

pansion of the form

i(x) + ijf ij(x)

+ i  jg ij(x) +    + ijkl m n o pdijkl

mnop(x) .

(2.65)

supersymmetry transformations are linearly realized on unconstrained superelds via the
super-dierential operators q and q by

s = (iqi + i qi)s ,

(2.66)

where i and i are innitesimal spinor parameters. the unconstrained supereld s,
just as a general n = 1 supereld, is reducible. thus, we seek suitable sets of n = 2
supersymmetric constraints to decompose s into irreducible components. since q and d
mutually anticommute, we may impose on s that some of its superderivatives vanishes.

we dene a n = 2 chiral supereld by imposing the constraints

d i = 0

i = 1, 2 .

(2.67)

notice that in order to preserve su(2)r symmetry, we are forced to impose the above con-
straint for both values of i. the chirality constraints (2.67) may be solved by introducing
the combinations

which satisfy

 = x  ii i
x

d ix

+ = 0,

dix

 = 0 .

(2.68)

(2.69)

thus, the supereld  depends only upon x

(x+, ) = (x+) + ii(x+) + ijfij(x+)

+ijkijk(x+) + d(x+) .

when  is a scalar supereld, for example, the components , f [](ij) and d are scalars,
 and  are spin 1/2 and f ()[ij] is a self-dual rank 2 antisymmetric tensor eld. (this
chiral supereld will naturally incorporate the eld strength of the n = 2 gauge multiplet,
as we shall see later). any complex analytic function f () of an n = 2 chiral supereld
is automatically also an n = 2 chiral supereld.

the term with the highest power of  of a (gauge invariant) n = 2 chiral supereld
transforms under n = 2 susy by a total space-time derivative, so that it may be used to
construct n = 2 invariant lagrangians. introducing the chiral measure d4  d21d22,
the combination
(2.71)

ld = d = z d4 

is an invariant lagrangian.

the n = 2 chiral supereld is reducible, unlike its n = 1 counterpart. to achieve an

abelian irreducible supereld, we may additionally impose the constraints

d j w .

(2.72)

as a result we have f[](ij) = ijk = 0, while , , f()[ij] and the auxiliary eld d are
unaected. it is customary to represent the solution to these constraints in the form of an
n = 1 supereld expansion,

w (x+, ) = (x+, 1) + 22w(x+, 1) + 22g(x+, 1) .

(2.73)

here,  is the n = 1 chiral supereld contained in the n = 2 gauge multiplet, while we
shall denote by v the n = 1 gauge supereld contained in the n = 2 gauge multiplet,
and denote the eld strength supereld associated with v by w. the auxiliary eld g
is then a eld that may be expressed in terms of  and v as follows,

g(x+, 1) = 

1

2 z d2 1(x+  i1 1, 1, 1)e2v (x+i1 1,1,1) .

(2.74)

the component eld contents of w is that of an abelian n = 2 gauge multiplet.

the n = 2 gauge supereld for a non-abelian gauge algebra g is obtained by intro-
ducing the g-valued supergauge elds ai and a i, and the associated gauge covariant
superderivatives
(2.75)
the n = 2 gauge supereld is now governed by the poincare algebra, the gauge algebra
g and the su(2)r-symmetry covariant constraints

d i = d i + i a i .

di = di + iai

invariant actions for the n = 2 gauge supermultiplet may be obtained by integrating a
chiral gauge invariant function of w . an n = 2 chiral supereld is obtained for any com-
plex analytic function trf (w ), called the prepotential. the most general gauge invariant,
n = 2 supersymmetric lagrangian is given by

sf = z dzm trf (w ) + complex conjugate

2.11 n=2 supereld methods : harmonic/analytic superspaces
the above construction of the gauge supereld on n = 2 unconstrained superspace does
not appear to extend to the o-shell hypermultiplet. the obstacle arises from the fact that
strong constraints have to be imposed on the supereld in order to retain only dynamical
elds with spin less or equal to 1/2. any such set of constraints turns out to be so strong
that it entails the eld equations as well. harmonic and analytic superspace methods were
introduced to remedy this situation. we discuss here only the case of n = 2.

in harmonic superspace [14] new bosonic coordinates are introduced, in addition to
the space-time coordinates zm . from a supergroup viewpoint, additional bosonic coor-
dinates appear naturally for any extended supersymmetry. for example, the conformal
supergroups su(2, 2|n ) have maximal bosonic subgroups su(2, 2)  su(n )r, where the
internal su(n )r is associated with new bosonic coordinates in superspace.
n = 2 harmonic superspace is parametrized by x, i,  i and the new bosonic

coordinates ui , i = 1, 2, with ui = ijuj and

(2.79)

the variables ui
form a complex orhonormal frame, transforming under the fundamental
representation of su(2)r in its index i, and under a u(1) in its  indices. harmonic
superspace is real in the sense that it is invariant under the following complex conjugation

(x) = x

(i) =  i

(ui) = ui

(2.80)

supersymmetry transformations on harmonic superspace are just the supersymmetry

transformations on unconstrained superspace, implemented with the invariance of ui ,

as well as d = (d++) and d0 = 1/2[d++, d].

analytic superspace is dened as the subspace of harmonic superspace parametrized by

the coordinates

(2.86)
it is the subspace in which  =  = 0). all n = 2 susy transformations
only (i.e.
leave this subspace invariant. analytic superspace is real in the sense that it has a natural
complex conjugation which will be denoted by c, and acts by

nates. (the complex conjugation  introduced previously induces a complex conjugation
a, ( ) =  , (ui) = ui
in the analytic basis of harmonic superspace as well (x
which does not leave analytic superspace invariant.)

n = 1. viewed as functions on harmonic superspace, they satisfy the constraints

if  has u(1) charge q, then the component eld  has charge q, the elds  and  have
charge q  1, f , g and a have charge q  2,  and  have charge q  3 and d has charge
q  4. for q even, one may impose the reality condition ((q))c = (q).
the dependence on the internal coordinates ui produces an innite number of com-
ponent elds which are functions of za. indeed, an analytic supereld with u(1) charge
q > 0 has a decomposition of the form

(q)(za, u) =



xn=0

(i1in+qj1jn)(za)u+

(i1    u+

in+quj1    ujn) .

(2.90)

both the n = 2 gauge multiplet and the hypermultiplet may be treated as analytic
superelds, with an o-shell n = 2 lagrangian, which contains precisely the appropriate
number of elds on-shell.

an invariant integration on analytic superspace may be dened in terms of the measure
dzadu, which may be expressed in terms of the space-time measure dza  d4xad2+d2 +
and the internal measure du. the latter is dened by

z du u+

(i1    u+

imuj1    ujn) = m+n,0 .

(2.91)

in order to get a u(1)-invariant lagrangian, the integration against the measure dza of
u(1)-charge 4 requires an analytic supereld of u(1) charge 4.

the hypermultiplet analytic supereld has u(1)-charge 1, and is denoted by +. a
good eld equation for this supereld will be such that the innite tower of auxiliary elds
associated with the u-dependence of + collapses to just the correct number of physical
elds. thus, the eld equations cannot just be built up from the superderivatives d and
d, but must involve derivation with respect to u. the natural candidate is the operator
d++, and the correct hypermultiplet free eld equation is d+++ = 0. the most general
u(1)-invariant action may be easily constructed along these lines, and one nds [14],

s[+] = z dza du {(+)cd+++ + u(+, (+)c)}

u(+, (+)c) = a(+)4 + b(+)c(+)3 + c((+)c)2(+)2 + b((+)c)3+ + a((+)c)4

(2.92)

the couplings all have dimensions of mass2 and thus are non-renormalizable.

the n = 2 gauge analytic supereld has u(1)-charge 2, and is denoted v ++. it is real
under the complex conjugation c that leaves analytic superspace invariant, (v ++)c = v ++.

28

gauge transformations are generated by analytic superelds  of u(1) charge 0, since they
must act consistently on the analytic superelds v ++ and on analytic hypermultiplets +.
the appropriate transformation laws are

(v ++) = ei (v ++  id++) ei
 = d+
since  is analytic, the superderivatives d+
covariant, while the remaining covariant derivatives are constructed by

 and d+

(+) = ei+ .

(2.93)

 are automatically

d++ = d++ + iv ++

d = d + ia

d = d + ia

(2.94)

the superconnections a and a may be expressed in terms of v ++, but we shall not
need their explicit form here.

the gauge eld strength w is an analytic supereld and was constructed in terms of

the supereld v ++ in [14],

w = 

i
4

eiv(cid:26) d+



d +(cid:18)eivdeiv(cid:19)(cid:27)eiv .

here, v is a general supereld (i.e. neither analytic nor chiral), dened by

(d++ + iv ++) eiv = 0 .

an explicit expression for w in terms of v ++ was obtained in [15] and is given by

bi. remarkably, the supereld w constructed in the
analytic superspace approach turns out to be independent of u altogether, and its kinemat-
ics thus reduces to that discussed in the preceding section on unconstrained superspace.

the most general n = 2 supersymmetric and g-gauge invariant action is thus
s = rez dzm du trf (w ;  ) +z dza du {(+)cd+++ + u(+, (+)c)}

(2.98)

where the potential u was given in (2.92). the prepotential function f is an arbitrary
complex analytic function of its arguments. in view of arguments similar to the ones given
for n = 1, f is also complex analytic in its coupling constants  . the renormalizable case
corresponds to f (w ;  ) = i w 2 and u = 0.

3 seiberg-witten theory

seiberg-witten theory deals with the construction of the non-perturbative dynamics of
n = 2 super-yang-mills theory in the limit of low energy and momemnta. the prime
motivation is the exploration of the fully non-perturbative dynamics of gauge theories,
a problem of quantum eld theory that has been outstanding for several decades now.
the restriction to n = 2 theories is made because the stronger constraints of extended
supersymmetry lead to simplied  yet highly non-trivial  dynamics of super-yang-mills
theory. the dynamics of the even more restricted n = 4 theory is even simpler than
that of the n = 2 theory, but the low energy approximation, obtained in seiberg-witten
theory, becomes rather trivial in this theory.

3.1 wilson eective couplings and actions

despite the large degree of supersymmetry, it is rather unlikely that the quantum eld
theory dened by the lagrangian (2.58) will be exactly solvable, in the sense that all its
correlation functions or even all its s-matrix elements could be obtained in explicit form.
fortunately, many of the physically most interesting questions, that have to do with the
non-perturbative dynamics of the theory, are related to the properties of the vacuum and
the lowest energy (and momentum) excitations above the vacuum. thus, there already is
great interest in obtaining information on the non-perturbative dynamics of these theories
in the limit of low energy only. the wilson renormalization group [16] provides the ideal
tool for deriving such low energy eective theories.

 the starting point is the bare quantum eld theory with a (energy-momentum) cuto
, in which all masses, energies and momenta of all elds are restricted to be less
than . (it is usually safest to consider such cutos in the euclidean version of the
theory, where they can be imposed in a lorentz invariant way.) the bare coupling
is denoted g().

 it is assumed that the masses, energies and momenta of physical relevance are much

smaller that .

 one introduces an arbitrary renormalization scale , with

physical masses, energies, momenta     .

(3.1)

one considers the wilson eective theory, in which only the particles and elds
of masses, energies and momenta less than  (i.e. the light elds) are retained as
quantum degrees of freedom from the original bare theory. all particles and elds
with masses, energies and momenta between the renormalization scale  and the
cuto scale  (i.e. the heavy elds) are integrated out. (the separation between light
and heavy modes is not usually gauge invariant. one may either work with gauge

30

invariant degrees of freedom directly, which is always hard, or, in perturbation theory,
one may replace gauge invariance with brst invariance. since brst invariance is a
global symmetry, separation into light and heavy modes may be achieved as usual.)
the eect of this integration over the heavy elds is summarized in terms of (an
innite series of) additional terms in the lagrangian. the resulting object is usually
referred to as the wilson eective lagrangian or eective action.

for example, in a theory of only a gauge eld a, with gauge eld strength f and a
single coupling g, the bare theory (ignoring gauge xing and ghost terms) involves the
bare eld strength f() and the bare coupling g(). the wilson eective theory involves
the eld strength f() and the eective gauge coupling g(), as well as an innite series of
higher dimension operators with numerical coecients which are functions of  and ,

(3.2)

here, it is understood that the elds f() and f() contain only modes of masses and
energies less than  and less than  respectively.

the wilson eective lagrangian at scale  essentially amounts to a taylor series ex-
pansion in the light elds obtained by integrating out the heavy elds. such a taylor
expansion is analytic by construction, and does not exhibit any infrared singularities by
construction. (this may be contrasted with the eective lagrangian dened as generat-
ing functional of connected one-particle-irreducible feynman graphs, which does exhibit
infrared singularities whenever massless particles are around.)

however, there is a generic situation in which the wilson eective lagrangian does
exhibit singularities. this occurs when one considers not a single theory, but rather a
family of theories obtained for example by varying one or several of the masses in the
theory. let m be such as mass. assume that we begin by analyzing a theory in which the
mass m is larger than the renormalization scale . thus, by the rules for the construction
of the wilson eective theory, we integrate out completely all the modes associated with
this mass m, and obtain a certain eective lagrangian lm. no infrared singularity occurs
since all the modes that were integrated out are massive. now, consider varying m, and
rendering m smaller than . the eective lagrangian lm still makes sense. however, as
soon as m < , lm strictly speaking is no longer the wilson eective action, since particles
with mass m <  have been completely integrated out. nonetheless, lm is a useful eective
action, especially because it is analytic in m, while the true wilson eective action will
have discontinuities at m = . as m  0, the eective action lm will in general develop
singularities, associated with the fact that massless modes will now have been integated
out along with massive ones. it is a fact that the only singularities in the wilson eective

31

action arise due to particles and elds becoming massless. thus, the singularity structure
of the eective action corresponds to the appearance of massless particles in the spectrum.

3.2 holomorphicity and non-renormalization

supersymmetric theories invariably have holomorphic data, such as the superpotential
u() or the gauge coupling ab(). under the wilson renormalization group procedure,
which preserves supersymmetry, these holomorphic data are modied in a holomorphic
way, and become the eective superpotential u e() and the eective gauge coupling
 e
ab (). the analyticity of the wilson renormalization group procedure, pointed out in the
preceding subsection, guarantees that complex analyticity will also be preserved [17, 18].
this property of supersymmetric data places severe restrictions on the renormalization
group ow in supersymmetric theories, and provides one of the key ingredients for seiberg-
witten theory.

the couplings entering these holomorphic data, such as the mass m and yukawa cou-
pling  in u(), or the gauge coupling  in ab(), are naturally complex numbers, and
the dependence of u or ab on them may be viewed as holomorphic as well. remarkably,
this holomorphicity property is also preserved under the wilson renormalization procedure.
the reason is that the complex parameters m and  and  may be viewed as vacuum expec-
tation values of chiral superelds. the holomorphic dependence on these new superelds
is preserved under the wilson renormalization procedure, just as that of the dynamical
chiral superelds was. the net result is that there will be highly restricted renormalization
eects (or none at all) on such complex couplings. to render this discussion more concrete,
we present two important examples.

(1) absence of mass and yukawa coupling renormalization

consider a renormalizable theory of a single chiral scalar supereld , with superpo-
tential u(; , m) = m2 + 3. holomorphicity considerations [18], discussed above,
imply that the eective superpotential u e (; , m) will be a holomorphic function of the
supereld  and of the couplings  and m. now, as  and m have both been promoted to
superelds, the superpotential u(; , m) has two u(1) symmetries. the rst u(1) is just
phase rotations of ,  and m in such a way that u is invariant. the second u(1)r is the
r-symmetry generator, under which the superpotential must have charge 2. the charge
assignments are listed in table 5. both symmetries remain after quantization and are pre-
served under the wilson renormalization group ow, so that u e has the same quantum
numbers as u. from the table 5, it is clear that the only quantity invariant under both
u(1) and u(1)r is /m. since the wilson eective lagrangian is analytic in the light
elds, u e gets only contributions of the form

m (cid:19)n
m2(cid:18)

but, these are all tree level contributions and can arise in the eective superpotential
u e only if they were already part of u. (one loop and higher order contributions would
include non-local terms in the eective action, as well as contributions that are not analytic
in the elds, such as is the case in the coleman-weinberg eective potential, which has
terms of the type 4 ln 2.) thus,  and m are not renormalized, a property that holds for
all values of the couplings, perturbative or non-perturbative. these conclusions are borne
out by explicit (super-) feynman graph arguments in perturbation theory.

(2) gauge coupling renormalization : -functions

the complex gauge coupling  enters in a holomorphic way in the gauge kinetic and
self-coupling terms, and we wish to derive the eects of the wilson renormalization group
procedure on this term as well [17].

z d2  tr(w w )

=

z d2 etr(w w ) .

(3.4)

we may again use u(1)r symmetry, but now, in the presence of gauge interactions, this
symmetry suers a triangle anomaly. in view of adler-bardeen type arguments, the per-
turbative contribution to the u(1)r anomaly is purely 1-loop and may be evaluated directly
from the triangle graph, with no need for the inclusion of radiative corrections. the result
is summarized by the wilson -function for the coupling g (ignoring temporarily ),

= (3c2(g) + t2(r))

g3
162 .

(3.5)

w (g) =

g()

 ln (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12),g()

here, we use the standard notations for the quadratic casimir and dynkin index in an
arbitrary representation r of g

t a

r = c2(r)ir

tr(t a

rt b

r) = t2(r)ab .

(3.6)

integrating the equation for the coupling ow, and restoring the  dependence in terms of
a complex valued generalization of the renormalization scale , we have

 ()   () =

1
2i

(3c2(g) + t2(r)) ln




(3.7)

for 3c2(g) > t2(r), the theory is asymptotically free, while for 3c2(g) = t2(g), the
theory has vanishing -function and will be conformally invariant provided no explicit

33

mass parameters arise. for 3c2(g) < t2(r), the theory becomes strongly coupled at
short distances : the microscopic dynamics of such theories is not well formulated in terms
of these degrees of freedom and we shall not consider this case any further here.
(3) applications to n = 2 and n = 4 theories
let us now consider an n = 2 super-yang-mills theory, where the gauge algebra is g
and the representation of the hypermultiplet is rh . then, the repesentation in terms of
n = 1 chiral multiplets is r = g  rh  rh , and we have t2(r) = c2(g) + 2t2(rh ), so
that

 ()   () =

1
i

(c2(g) + t2(rh)) ln




(3.8)

moving onto the n = 4 theory, for which rh = g, we see that the  function vanishes
identically and the theory is uv nite.
if the vacuum expectation value of the gauge
scalars vanishes, this theory is exactly (super-) conformally invariant, while if the vacuum
expectation value is non-zero, superconformal invariance is spontaneously broken.

3.3 low energy dynamics of n=2 super-yang-mills
the gauge multiplet part of the renormalizable n = 2 supersymmetric lagrangian is
derived from expanding the superelds lagrangian of (2.58) in terms of component elds
and dropping the contribution of the hypermultiplet,

l =

2g2 trf f 
i
2g2 trd 

i
2g2 tr d + i


162 trf f 

1
2g2 trdd +

1
2g2 tr[, ]2
2
g2 tr([, ] ) .

2
g2 tr([, ])  i

(3.9)

we note the symmetry in   , which is a manifestation of r-symmetry. to derive the
low energy dynamics of this theory, we begin by identifying the ground state(s). since l
is supersymmetric, its hamiltonian is positive, and the energy of any state, including the
ground state is positive or zero. if we can nd a state with exactly zero energy, then this
state is one of the possible ground states or vacua of the theory, and supersymmetry in
this vacuum will be unbroken.

at the semi-classical level, a solution of vanishing energy will require that the following

quantities vanish simultaneously,

f = 0

d = 0

tr([, ]2) = 0

(3.10)

so that the gauge eld a is pure gauge. by a gauge choice, we may pick a = 0, so that 
must be constant, and only the last equation of (3.10) remains to be solved. since   g,
which is the lie algebra of a compact gauge group, tr([, ]2) = 0 implies [, ] = 0.
now,  is a complex eld, in the adjoint representation of g, and may thus be decomposed
into its hermitian and anti-hermitian parts  = 1 + i2, with 1,2 = 1,2 and [1, 2] = 0.

34

thus, 1 and 2 may be simultaneously diagonalized, each with real eigenvalues. this
implies that the original  may be diagonalized with complex eigenvalues. thus, we nd
not just a single zero energy state, but rather a family of zero energy states, each of
which is a candidate vacuum. it is customary to denote these ground states by |0i, but it
is understood that this symbol really is parametrized by the vacuum expectation values
of the gauge scalar . while these results were derived here within the semi-classical
approximation, they hold true in the full quantum theory as well.

a convenient basis for the diagonal matrices is provided by the cartan generators hj
of g, with j = 1,   , n = rank(g), which obey [hi, hj] = 0. the vacuum expectation value
of the gauge scalar is then

n

h0||0i =

ajhj

xj=1

(3.11)

the complex parameters aj, j = 1,   , n are called the quantum moduli or quantum order
parameters of the vacuum. the semiclassical limits of these parameters are denoted by aj,
j = 1,   , n and are called the classical moduli or classical order parameters.

for generic values of the moduli aj, the vacuum expectation value h0||0i will have
all distinct eigenvalues. since the eld transforms under the adjoint representation of
g, the standard higgs mechanism will break the gauge symmetry to that of the cartan
subalgebra u(1)n. actually, the role of the dierent cartan generators may be permuted
under the set of residual (discrete) gauge transformations which form the weyl(g) group.
thus, the detailed symmetry breaking is given by [8]

g  u(1)n/weyl(g) .

(3.12)

in other words, the theory after symmetry breakdown reduces to n copies of (supersym-
metric) electro-magnetism, and for this reason is often said to be in the coulomb phase.

at the semi-classical level, non-generic values of aj may yield a larger symmetry group.
it will be one of the fundamental results of seiberg-witten theory that in the full quan-
tum theory, such larger residual symmetry groups do not survive quantization, so that
the theory is always in the coulomb phase. for suciently large gauge algebra or for
suciently large hypermultiplet contents, novel phenomena, such as the coexistence of
massless electrically charged particles with massless magnetic monopoles is possible at
so-called argyres-douglas points or curves [19].

3.4 particle and field contents
since we are left with n = rank(g) factors of u(1), we have n dierent massless u(1) gauge
n = 2 supersymmetry multiplets. the elds in these multiplets may be read o from our
general classication,

(aj, j, j)

h0|j|0i = aj

j = 1,   , n .

(3.13)

35

 for each of the dim(g)  rank(g) roots  of g, we have a massive vector boson mul-
tiplet appearing in the spectrum as a single particle state, described by the eld multiplet

(v, , )

 = root of g .

(3.14)

counting the number of elds for each spin, and comparing with the n = 2 entries of
table 4, we see that this massive vector boson multiplet must be a bps multiplet ! as a
result, we have the bps formula for the masses of this multiplet in terms of the central
charges, which are given by   a,

m w

 = |~  ~a|

~a = (a1,   , an) .

(3.15)

 as the simple gauge algebra g is broken to a subalgebra which includes u(1) factors,
in
general arguments show that t hooft-polyakov magnetic monopoles will arise [20].
fact, precisely one magnetic monopoles arises for each possible embedding of su(2) into
g, i.e. for each root  of g.
it is instructive to recall the set-up of the basic t hooft-polyakov solution in the
bogomolnyi-prasad-sommereld (bps) limit [21]. the limit consists in ignoring the quar-
tic higgs eld potential, but retaining the boundary conditions on the higgs eld that
it should tend towards a constant value at spatial . (this is automatically the set-up
we have in n = 2 super-yang-mills when the gauge symmetry is broken to a u(1) fac-
tor.) now, the magnetic monopole is a stable, static soliton solution, magnetically charged
under the unbroken u(1). in the bps limit, the energy is given by

1

e =

=

i(cid:19)
g2 z d3x(cid:18)tr(di)2 + trb2
g2 z d3xtr(di  bi)2 
g2 z d3xi(trbi)

1

2

(3.16)

where the  signs are correlated. the second term on the rhs of (3.16) is proportional to
the magnetic charge. the rst term on the rhs of (3.16) is always positive or zero, and
this fact guarantees that the energy is bounded from below by the magnetic charge of the
monopole. this so-called bps bound is really nothing else than the bps bounds we have
encountered in the study of extended supersymmetry. a bps solution (which preserves
n = 1 supersymmetry) is obtained by saturating the bps bound upon setting the rst
term on the rhs of (3.16) to zero.
this construction will give us a bps formula (at the semi-classical level) for the mass of
the t hooft-polyakov magnetic monopole in terms of the vacuum expectation value of the
gauge scalar. appling this construction for any su(2) subgroup of g, specied uniquely
by a root ~ of g, and using the fact that  = ~a  ~a, we nd the semi-classical magnetic
monopole bps mass formula

m m

 = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

~  ~a (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(3.17)

here, we have also included the eect of the  angle, which is to produce an electric charge
on the magnetic monopole and make it into a dyon [22].

 in fact, a general dyon (single particle state) may be specied by two roots : one root
~ for its electric charge as in the construction of vector boson masses; and one (co)root ~
for its magnetic charge as in the construction of the magnetic monopole masses. the full
quantum bps mass formula for such a dyon is [7], [23]

(~,~) = |~  ~a + ~  ~ad| .
m d

(3.18)

in the semi-classical limit, the quantity ~ad is given by ~ad = ~a, but at the full quantum
level the expression for ~ad in terms of ~a will be modied. one of the goals of seiberg-
witten theory will be to predict precisely what the relation between these two quantities
is. given this information, the masses of all bps states (including vector bosons, magnetic
monopoles and dyons) will be known exactly in terms of the vacuum moduli parameters
aj. in the more constrained n = 4 theory, the relation ad =  a will not be renormalized
at the full quantum level.

3.5 form of the n=2 low energy eective lagrangian

with the preceding subsection, we know precisely what the particle spectrum of the n = 2
super-yang-mills theory will be. upon restriction to the low energy part of the spectrum,
the eects of the massive vector bosons and magnetic monoples and dyons will decouple.
only the n massless n = 2 abelian u(1) gauge supermultiplets will remain.2 thus, we
are left with the problem of determining the most general low energy eective action of n
massless u(1) gauge supermultiplets, with elds (aj
, j), as function of the vacuum
moduli parameters aj, which are the expectation values of the gauge scalars j.

, j

we have two methods available to do this : we could start directly from the manifestly
n = 2 supersymmetric formulation of 2.10; or start from an n = 1 standard supereld
formulation and attempt to impose the extra n = 2 susy by hand. it turns out to be very
instructive to start with the latter. to do this, we rst construct the most general n = 1
invariant lagrangian with this eld content, and we shall then enforce the supplementary
constraints of n = 2 supersymmetry [24]. in terms of n = 1 superelds, the n multiplets
decompose into r abelian u(1) vector superelds vj  (aj, j
 = j) and n chiral
superelds j  (j
+ = j, j), which are neutral under the u(1)n gauge group. the eld
strength superelds are simply

w j

 = 

1
4

d ddv j .

(3.19)

2we note here though that for special values of the vacuum moduli, one or several of the dyons may
also becomes massless. this phenomenon and its symptoms in the wilson eective action are central
features of the theory. they will be investigated extensively in the next subsections.

37

the full eective action is now gotten by putting together the superpotential part lu ,
the gauge coupling part lg and the kahler part lk of subsection 2.8. since the chiral
superelds j are neutral, the kahler potential does not involve the gauge elds vj. we
have

l = z d4 k(j, (j)) + rez d2(cid:26)u(j) + ij(k)w iw j(cid:27) .

(3.20)

here, the superpotential u(j) and the gauge coupling ij(k) are complex analytic func-
tions of the chiral superelds j.

the rst step towards enforcing n = 2 supersymmetry is to expand the superelds of
(3.20) in terms of components and eliminate the auxiliary elds. this step is necessary
because the auxiliary elds of the n = 1 superelds do not have a natural place in or
good transformation properties under n = 2 supersymmetry. the result is
 j + re(cid:26)ij 2u
ij(cid:27)

l = gij(did j + i j di)

here, the kahler metric gij is given in terms of the kahler potential k by

gij(, ) =

(3.21)

(3.22)

(3.23)

the covariant derivative d is taken with respect to the levi-civita connection i
metric gij,

jk of the

di = i + i

jkjk .

no gauge eld enters here, because the chiral multiplet in which i and i belong are
neutral under the gauge group.

to enforce n = 2 supersymmetry directly is still not so easy. however, as part of n = 2
supersymmetry, we know that the elds aj
 and j of the n = 2 gauge supermultiplets
have to transform as singlets under the su(2)r symmetry, while the fermions i and i
must combine into an su(2)r doublet. thus, we may rst enforce, as a necessary condition
for n = 2 supersymmetry, the requirement that i and i enter symmetrically.

clearly, there is no yukawa interaction for the eld i, and thus, the yukawa interaction
must also be absent for the  elds. thus, u(i) can be at most linear in i. in fact, if
u(i) has any dependence on i at all, then the |u|2 term will always be strictly positive
and supersymmetry will be broken spontaneously. discarding this possibility, u must be
constant, and may hence be set to u = 0 : the superpotential is absent !

next, the kinetic terms of i and i must be equal. this requires the relation

1
2i

(ij()  ij()) =

2k(, )

i j

.

38

(3.24)

to solve (3.24), we make use of the holomorphicity of ij and of its symmetry under i  j.
considering ij as a given holomorphic function, k is determined by a linear dierential
equation, which is trivially solved in terms of holomorphic functions ti(),

with the relation

k(, ) = ti() i + ti()i

1
2i

ij() =

tj()
i =

ti()

j

.

(3.25)

(3.26)

the second equality in (3.26) holds in view of the fact that ij is symmetric, and imme-
diately implies that ti() is a pure gradient of a single holomorphic function, called the
prepotential and usually denoted by f (). we have then

ti() =

1
2i

f ()
i

(3.27)

remarkably, the entire low energy eective action l has now been completely de-
termined in terms of this single prepotential function f ().
in view of the arguments
presented earlier showing holomorphicity as a function of the masses, gauge coupling and
yukawa couplings, we know that f is also holomorphic as a function of the gauge coupling
 and the hypermultiplet masses m : f (; ma,  ). the n = 2 low energy eective action
for the r u(1) gauge multiplets is thus

l = im(ij) f i

f j + re(ij) f i


f j + im( jdj) + fermions

(3.28)

with

dj =

f ()
j

ij() =

2f ()
ij .

(3.29)

here, it is understood that the gauge scalar j takes on a vacuum expectation value aj,
which are arbitrary complex numbers.

that the lagrangian (3.28) is fully invariant under the n = 2 susy follows almost
trivially by obtaining it from the expansion of the manifestly n = 2 supersymmetric
lagrangian for gauge group u(1)n of (2.98) and without hypermultiplets.

3.6 physical properties of the prepotential
since f () only depends upon the eld and not upon space-time derivatives , f
is uniquely determined by its values on the expectation values aj, so we consider now
the complex analytic function f (aj; ma,  ). f is subject to two fundamental physical
properties.

 f (aj; ma,  ) is complex analytic by n = 2 supersymmetry;

39

 ij(a) = 2faiaj

obeys im(ij) > 0 since this function plays the role of a metric on
the gauge kinetic terms. unless im(ij) > 0, some gauge elds will propagate with
negative probability.

as a result of the above two properties of f , we nd that f cannot be a single valued
function of the vacuum moduli aj (or of the gauge coupling  ). indeed, if f were single-
valued, then im(ij) will be a single-valued harmonic function, which by the second point
above is bounded from below. but, by the maximum pinciple, such a harmonic function
must in fact be constant. if it is not constant, then it can never be bounded from below
or from above. these properties form the basis for the construction of f given by seiberg
and witten [8].

actually, we can easily explore the properties of the function f in the regime of
large vacuum expectation values, since the eects of renormalization are then known from
asymptotic freedom, and we nd for say g = su(n),

(3.30)

(3.31)

as aj  . integrating up to derive f , we nd

ij =

ln(ai  aj)2/2 ,

f 

i

8 xi,j

(ai  aj)2 ln(ai  aj)2/2 .

the expression for f in this limit clearly shows that f is neither constant nor single-valued.
in fact, the nature of the multiple-valuedness (also called the monodromy) of f and
of ij is understood in part. a 2 rotation of any ai  aj amounts to a shift of the ij
angle by 4. this shift is physically immaterial since the instanton angles ij are periodic
with period 2. however, this cannot be the source of all the monodromy of f . for, if
it were, then the expression (3.30) would continue to be the source of this monodromy
down to ai  aj  0. but, as ai  aj  0, we would invariably led into a domain where
im(ij) < 0, violating the positivity property im(ij) > 0 explained previously. the source
of additional monodromy is much more subtle and will be explained next.

3.7 electric-magnetic duality
we begin by discussing rst the case of g = su(2) gauge group and no hypermultiplets.
the elds are then the single gauge scalar , the gauge eld a with eld strength f,
and the prepotential is a complex analytic function f () dependent on a single complex
 only. the eective lagrangian is then

 (cid:19)

the kinetic term is manifestly invariant under the linear action of an m  sl(2, r) =
sp(2, r) on d and , with

(cid:18) d
 (cid:19)  m (cid:18) d
 (cid:19)

mjm = j

(3.33)

this group is generated by translations t and an inversion s, given by

t = (cid:18) 1

0 (cid:19) .

the action of t on , d and  () is as follows

d  d + 
  

 ()   () +  .

(3.34)

(3.35)

this shift is precisely of the form of a shift in the angle , and will be immaterial only
if  is an integer multiple of 2. thus, while the full sl(2, r) leaves the kinetic term
invariant, only a subgroup 0(2)  sl(2, z) will leave the quantum mechanical physics of
the problem unchanged. the action of s on , d and  () is as follows

d  
  d

 ()  1/ () .

(3.36)

considering the special case where  = 0, the transformation on the remaining coupling g
in  is by inversion : g  1/g, and thus exchanges small and large coupling regimes.

thus far, we have implemented the action of the transformation s only on the scalar
kinetic term, and it remains to implement s on the gauge eld. but, the gauge part of the
action does not manifestly exhibit a symmetry in which g  1/g. the key novel ingredient
is the fact that upon g  1/g, the gauge eld a must simultaneously be replaced by its
dual eld ad. this transformation interchanges the roles of electric and magnetic elds,
as was considered by montonen and olive [7].

the fact that g  1/g is related to an electric-magnetic duality transformation may
be seen intuitively from the dirac quantization condition. if we denote by g the unit of
electric charge and by gd the unit of magnetic charge, then the dirac condition requires
g  gd  1 in units where h = 1. thus, as g  1/g, we have equivalently g  gd, and
electric and magnetic charge are being exchanged.

electric-magnetic duality in the free maxwells equations  f  = f  = 0 is a
manifest symmetry, realized by f   f . at the level of the lagrangian, the symmetry

41

is obscured by the fact that the bianchi identity  f  = 0 has been solved for in terms
of the gauge potential, thus obscuring duality symmetry.

to exhibit duality in the action, we must arrange to have both the eld equations
f  = 0 and the bianchi identities  f  = 0 emerge as eld equations. this may be
done by formulating the action in terms of an independent eld strength eld f and by
enforcing the bianchi identity by introducing a lagrange multiplier eld ad. we shall
carry out this duality transformation only on the gauge eld, but a full supersymmetric
argument is possible as well. we have

sg = z im ()(f + i f )2 + 2z ad f  .

(3.37)

we consider the lagrange multiplier ad as a eld in its own right, and introduce its eld
strength fd = ad  ad. upon integration by parts, the last term in sg is then
r fdf , and we may complete the square in f as follows

(3.38)

sg = z im(cid:20) (){f + i f +

1

(fd + i fd)}2 

 ()

1

 ()

(fd + i fd)2(cid:21) .

integrating out the unconstrained eld f by gaussian integration, we are left with the
same action sg, but formulated entirely in terms of the dual gauge eld ad, and given
by

sg = z im(cid:20)

1

 ()

(fd + i fd)2(cid:21) .

(3.39)

thus, the s transformation in which  ()  1/ () has been realized on the gauge eld
as well. the precise monodromy group is generated by the transformations t2 and s of
(3.34), and this group is a subgroup 0(2) of the group sl(2, z), which is generated by t1
and s.

3.8 monodromy via elliptic curves for su(2) gauge group

we have now obtained a precise formulation of the monodromy problem associated with
the seiberg-witten theory for su(2) gauge group.

a (cid:19) transforms linearly under the 0(2)  sl(2, z) monodromy group;

 (cid:18) ad
  (a) = ad/a obeys the condition im (a) > 0;
 the monodromy t2 is realized in the limit where a  .
generally, such monodromy problems are very hard to solve. here however, we have
one very important hint : a complex quantity  with positive denite imaginary part. such
quantities are also fundamental in the theory of riemann surfaces, where they describe the

42

moduli of riemann surfaces and the positivity condition ensures regularity of the surface.
in our case, the relevant riemann surface is an elliptic curve or equivalently a torus.

the torus is conveniently described as an elliptic curve in cp2, parametrized by two

complex coordinates (k, y), and given by

y2 = (k  2)(k + 2)(k  u) .

(3.40)

here  is an overall scale, and u parametrizes the modulus  of the elliptic curve. one
may view the elliptic curve as realized by a double cover of the complex plane (the two
sheets corresponding to the y branches) with branch points 2, u and , and branch
cuts for example along [2, +2] and [u,].

a canonical basis for the homology 1-cycles (in which the cycles a and b intersect
precisely once) is provided by the following closed curves; a : circling the banch cut
from branch points +2 to u circling from the upper to the
[2, +2] once; and b :
lower sheets and back. this choice of homology cycles is not unique however, even when we
require single intersection. any change of homology basis by a symplectic transformation
with integer coecients will preserve canonical intersection

mjm = j

(3.41)

notice the similarity with the transformation properties of d and  in (3.33).

there is a unique holomorphic 1-form (or abelian dierential of the rst kind), dk/y,

whose abelian integral is

z(p )  z(q) = z p

.

(3.42)

this integral is multiple valued, and the periods of the torus are dened by the following
contour integrals

(3.43)

the value of the matrix of periods (d ) is subject to monodromy as the canonical

 (cid:19)

mjm = j

m  sl(2, z)

(3.44)

this transformation law is strongly suggestive in view of its similarity with the transfor-
mation law for d and  in (3.33). the modulus of the elliptic curve is dened by

 =

d


im > 0 ,

(3.45)

where the last condition guarantees that the curve is non-singular.

43

we are now ready to identify the data of seiberg-witten theory and those of the family
of elliptic curves parametrized by the modulus  , or equivalently by the complex parameter
u. the modulus of the curve  is identied with the seiberg-witten gauge coupling  (a),
so that

(3.48)

where the dierential 1-form d, usually called the seiberg-witten dierential is such that

(3.52)

the function ad(a) and  (a) are then obtained by eliminating u.

3.9 physical interpretation of singularities
the elliptic curve y2 = (k 2)(k + 2)(k u) has precisely 3 singularities at u = 2, 
where the curve degenerates. these singularities translate into singular behavior of ad(a)
and  (a). for all other u  c, these quantities are regular.

44

recall from the discussion of the wilson eective action that singularities will arise
in  (a) and f (a) if and only if the mass(es) of some particle(s) that was integrated out
in the wilson remnormalization group procedure actually becomes zero. now, we know
the masses of all massive vector bosons, magnetic monopoles and dyons, because these
particles belong to short bps multiplets of n = 2 supersymmetry and so their masses
obey the bps bound
(3.53)

m = |n2a + nmad|

where ne and nm are the electric and magnetic charges respectively. whenever ad/a
becomes a rational number, some dyon masses will become zero. in our case, there are
only three candidate values for the vacuum moduli where this can happen, and we now
study those in turn, using the explicit solution of (3.50).

as a consistency check that the above singularities are the only ones required to satisfy
the monodromy conditions in a consistent way, one may check that the product of all three
monodromies is proportional to the identity matrix dd+2d2 = i.
physically, the remarkable new phenomenon that emerges from this study of the wilson
eective action is that magnetic monopoles and dyons, which are usually encountered as
heavy semi-classical soliton solutions, may actually become massless at strong coupling.

3.10 hypergeometric function representation

in their original paper, seiberg and witten [8] were actually able to identify the additional
monodromies at u = 2, without solving rst for (a, ad). their arguments were as
follows. since f is not global, it has at least 3 singularities. as explained earlier, the
appearance of a singularity in the wilson eective action is due to a particle becoming
massless. the key physical input is the realization that the particle becoming massless
is a monopole. the magnetic coupling d can then be evaluated in the dual formulation
in terms of the dual gauge eld ad, giving the monodromy matrix d+2. the remaining
monodromy matrix d2 follows from the relation dd+2d2 = i for the homotopy
group of the sphere with 3 punctures.
in this way, the three monodromy matrices of
(3.57) are recovered. here we indicate briey how the monodromy problem can be solved
in terms of hypergeometric functions, if all three monodromies d, d+2, and d2 are
already known and given by (3.57).

we look for (ad, a) as solutions of a second order dierential equation with regular

singular points. for simplicity, set  = 1. consider the equation

d2
dz2 + v (z))(z) = 0

(

(3.58)

where v (z) is a meromorphic function with at most double poles. then the equation
admits two independent solutions 1, 2 which get transformed into a linear combination
of each other under analytic continuation around each of the poles of v (z). in the present
case, there should be 3 singularities at z = 2, 2,, and a candidate for v (z) is

. the solutions behave asymptotically like z(13)/2 if 3 6= 0,
and like z and z ln z when 3 = 0. comparing with the desired behavior for a and
ad, we set 3 = 0. next, considering asymptotics as z  2, we are led to the choice
1 = 2 = 1.

now the solutions  of (3.58) are related to those of the standard hypergeometric

equation x(1  x)f + [c  (a + b + 1)x]f  abf = 0 by

(z) = (z + 1)(11)/2(z  1)(12)/2f (

f2(x) = (x)af (a, a + 1  c; a + 1  b;

4 more general gauge groups, hypermultiplets

in the previous section, we reviewed seiberg-witten theory for an n = 2 super-yang-mills
theory with gauge group su(2) and no hypermultiplets present. the key ingredients were

 the sw curve (u) given by y2 = (k  2)(k + 2)(k  u);
 the sw dierential d = (k  u)y1dk;
 the relation between the periods of d, the quantum moduli a and ad and the

prepotential f by
a =

1

2i ia

d

ad =

1

2i ib

d

ad =

f
a

(4.1)

(henceforth, we shall include an extra factor of 2i in the normalization of d.) in this
section, we shall review the known generalizations of this construction to

 higher gauge algebras su(n), so(n), sp(n), and exceptional algebras;
 including hypermultiplets in various representations of the gauge algebra, with the
constraint that the theory remain asymptotically free or have vanishing -function.

a useful starting point is again the symmetries of the gauge scalar kinetic term, which

we shall rewrite as follows

i (cid:19)
2imidi = i(cid:18) di

jij(cid:18) di
i (cid:19)

j = (cid:18) 0 i
0 (cid:19)

i

(4.2)

where the indices i, j = 1,   , n = rank(g). this part of the low energy eective la-
grangian is invariant under the continuous symmetry group sp(2n, r). the subgroup of
abelian transformations of the type

t : (cid:18) di

i (cid:19)  (cid:18) i 

i (cid:19)(cid:18) di
i (cid:19)

0

plays a special role. its eect on the gauge coupling matrix ij is by shifts by  :

t : re(ij)  re(ij) + ij .

(4.3)

(4.4)

however, these transformations have the eect of shifting the instanton angles ij by 2ij,
and thus the entries ij must be integers. this restriction restricts the full invariance group
of the gauge scalar kinetic term to the subgroup sp(2n, z).

the group sp(2n, z) may be viewed as being generated by transformations t, as in
(4.3), with integer entries, together with the inversion   1. this transformation
exchanges weak and strong coupling, and may be interpreted as a generalized electric-
magnetic duality transformation, extending the case of su(2) gauge group.

48

4.1 model of riemann surfaces

consider a compact riemann surface  without boundary of genus g; such a surface may
be thought of as a sphere with g handles attached to it. let {ai, bi, i = 1,   , g} be a
basis of closed 1-cycles for the homology h1(, z) of , so that the intersection form # is
canonical

#(ai, aj) = #(bi, bj) = 0
#(ai, bj) = #(bj, ai) = ij .

(4.5)

dual to this canonical homology basis are the g independent holomorphic 1-forms i,
i = 1,   , g (abelian dierentials of the 1-st kind) with periods

ij = iai

j

dij = ibi

j .

the period matrix ij is dened by

  d1

ij = xk

dik(1)kj .

the riemann theorems imply two key properties of the period matrix

(1)
im > 0
(2) ij = ji .

for non  degenerate 

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

finally, a change in homology basis from {ai, bi} to {ai, bi} that preserves the inter-
section form # is an element of sp(2g, z), since the intersection matrix is equivalent to
the symplectic matrix in 2g dimensions,

ai(cid:19)  (cid:18) bi
(cid:18) bi

ai(cid:19) = m (cid:18) bi
ai(cid:19)

m  sp(2g, z) .

(4.9)

thus, the monodromy group of the abelian integrals of (4.6) is a subgroup of sp(2g, z).

4.2

identifying seiberg-witten and riemann surface data

a natural generalization of the seiberg-witten construction for su(2) gauge group emerges
in the following way.

 the seiberg-witten curve is a family of riemann surfaces (u1,   , un), parametrized
by n complex parameters u1,   , un, which play the role of vacuum moduli and parametrize
the at directions of n = 2 vacua. the family of curves may contain singular curves
for certain values of ui, but these singularities should arise only when physical massless
particles appear.

49

 the curves (ui) must be invariant under the weyl group weyl(g), which is the
residual gauge invariance after the gauge algebra g has been broken down to its cartan
subalgebra, u(1)n.
 the seiberg-witten dierential d is a meromorphic 1-form on  such that d/ui
is a holomorphic 1-form (or abelian dierential of the rst kind) on . the residues at
the poles of d are then automatically independent of ui, and are linear combinations
of the hypermultiplet mass parameters. physically, the fact that the residues of d are
independent of the ui means that the hypermultiplet masses (entering in the n = 1
superpotential) are not renormalized and thus are unchanged under any changes in ui.
linearity of the residues in terms of the hypermultiplet mass parameters is required by
the bps mass formula, in which the hypermultiplet mass parameters enter linearly.

 the periods of  then enter in the following way. since d/uj are holomorphic
1-forms, a period matrix ij may be constructed from by integrating these 1-forms on a
set of homology cycles ai, bi, i = 1,   , n as follows. we begin by dening the periods

ij =

dij =

1

=

=

ai
uj
adi
uj

2i iai
2i ibi

1

d
uj
d
uj

(4.10)

where we have identied the periods  and d with the relevant super-yang-mills quan-
tities. the gauge coupling constant matrix  may now be naturally connected with the
riemann surface data by

 =

ad

u (cid:18) a

u(cid:19)1

.

(4.11)

by making this identication, we guarantee that im( ) > 0, ij = ji and holomorphicity
of ij as a function of ui. recall that these were the key ingredients in the seiberg-witten
construction. upon integrating in uk, we obtain the fundamental relations

ai =

1

2i iai

d

adi =

1

2i ibi

d .

(4.12)

 for the simplest cases, to be explained shortly,  is precisely of genus g = n, and ai,
bi i = 1,   , n form a basis of h1(, z). but more generally, n  g, and ai, bi form a
suitable subset of h1(, z).

 a crucial requirement of the seiberg-witten and riemann surface correspondence is
that the prepotential f dened by the riemann surface data, adk = f /ak, must have
the logarithmic singularities f pert predicted by perturbative eld theory in the regime of
large vacuum expectation values. for g = su(n) and no hypermultiplet, these singu-
larities have been described in (3.31). for general gauge algebra g with roots r(g) and
hypermultiplet of mass m in a representation r of g with weights w(r), they are given

50

by

f pert(a) =

(  a + m)2 ln

(  a + m)2

(cid:21)

(4.13)

in view of the above correspondence, obtaining the seiberg-witten solution for any
given gauge algebra and hypermultiplet representation has been reduced to obtaining the
seiberg-witten curve (ui), the seiberg-witten dierential d and the cycles ai, bi on
(ui). the monodromy problem is in general very dicult to solve, and more indirect
arguments are needed to proceed. the key considerations that have been made use of in the
construction for su(n), so(n) and sp(n) gauge algebras, with either no hypermultiplets
or hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of the gauge algebra are as follows.

 matching the singularity structure of the curve (ui) with the appearance of massless

particles in the n = 2 super-yang-mills theory;

 u(1)r charge assignments;
 decoupling limits to smaller gauge algebras and smaller hypermultiplet contents,
including to the smallest of them all, namely the su(2) gauge algebra which is
known from the original seiberg-witten work;

 educated guesswork.

4.3 su(n) gauge algebras, fundamental hypermultiplets
we treat rst the case of g = su(n) gauge theory (for which n = n  1), and nf
hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation of su(n). we shall limit ourselves
to asymptotically free theories, for which the number of fundamental hypermultiplets is
constrained by nf < 2nc. the curve proposed in [25] is given by

(ui) = {(k, y)

y2 = a(k)2  2b(k)}

  n 1

2 nf

(4.14)

where the functions a and b are given by

a(k) =

n

yi=1
(k  ui)

b(k) =

nf

y=1

(k + m) ,

(4.15)

and m are the hypermultiplet masses. the seiberg-witten dierential is dened to be

d = k d ln (y + a(k))

(4.16)

we observe that even when nf = 0 and n = 2, this curve and dierential are dierent from
the curve found originally for su(2) in 3.8. indeed, the seiberg-witten curves associated

51

with a given gauge theory are not unique, although they may satisfy the same criteria
outlined above. we shall check below that these criteria are satised by the curve (4.14)
for the su(n) gauge theory with nf hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation.

when  = 0, the curve degenerates to two copies of the complex plane given by
y = a(k), which have a double intersection precisely (and only) at the zeroes ui of a(k).
as  6= 0, the double zeros open up into branch cuts. the end points xk of these branch
cuts are dened by
(4.17)
there will be precisely n branch cuts, so that the genus of the curve is n = n  1. thus,
the set of cycles ai and bi may be chosen to be a basis of h1(, z). the seiberg-witten
dierential may be written as

a(xk )2  b(xk ) = 0.

d =

k dk

y (cid:18)a(k) 

1
2

a(k)

b(k)

b(k)(cid:19) .

(4.18)

since this expression diers from the one in (4.16) by the term 2 kb(k)dk/b(k), which
has zero periods. it is easy to see that the residues of d are independent of ui, since the
only poles (at nite k) appear at k = m through the term inverse in b(k). in fact,
around k = m, we have y  a(k), and the behavior of d is given by

d 

1
2

m dk
k + m

.

(4.19)

similarly, the pole at k =  has a residue independent of ui and thus d/ui is holo-
morphic.

there are a number of simple checks on the validity of this curve. first, by making
2 xed, we decouple precisely
a hypermultiplet mass, say mnf large, while keeping mnf
the hypermultiplet with mass mnf . the limit of the corresponding curve agrees with the
curve with one less hypermultiplet. second, by letting one of the vacuum expectation
values become large, one obtains a limit in which the gauge group su(n)  su(n  1).
again the corresponding limits of the curves agree. lastly, it was argued based upon
the picard-lefschetz construction, that the strong coupling monodromies agree with the
values expected from the dyon quantum numbers in the theory.

however, the true check which we need to carry out is that the family of riemann
surfaces reproduce the correct logarithmic singularities found in the perturbative regime
for the prepotential f pert (c.f. (4.13)). this is the regime where  is small compared to
the gauge scalar vacuum expectation values ai and the hypermultiplet masses m.

the rst step is to derive the quantum order parameters ak = 1

2i hak d in terms of
their classical limits uk. now the cycles ak, 2  k  n, can be chosen to be contours
surrounding the branch cuts between xk and x+
k , which remain at a xed distance from

52

uk while the branch cuts themselves shrink to uk as   0. this means that for  small
compared to uk, we may expand

d = k(

(4.20)

this reduces d to a rational dierential on a sphere with punctures. the method of
residues applies readily to the evaluation of the periods around ak, and we nd

ai = ui +

the evaluation of the dual variables adk = 1

a(k)2 = q(k + m)
ql6=i(k  ul)2 .
2i hbk d is more dicult. this is because
the cycles bk correspond to paths going from x1 to xk on each sheet, unlike the ak cycles
k cut as   0. the expansion
which can be chosen at a xed distance from the cut xk , x+
(4.20) cannot be applied to the evaluation of the bk periods as it stands. however, we can
restore its validity by introducing a parameter  with || small, and deform d to

(4.23)

the main advantage is that for xed small , the expansion is reliable and the evaluation
of the periods of d() reduce to integrals of rational dierentials, just as before in the
evaluation of the ak-periods (in practice, for each order 2m, it suces to retain terms with
poles of order up to 2m). the periods adk of d are then obtained by analytic continuation
to  = 1.

it is now easy to identify the logarithmic terms in the resulting prepotential. clearly,

we have

(4.24)

since the residues of d at k + m = 0 are known to be 1

around the ai cycles tend to the residues of d at ui as   0. the bi periods of d are

where the terms o() are analytic functions of . thus there are no higher powers of
ln  in the prepotential, in agreement with the non-renormalization theorem for n = 2
supersymmetric gauge theories. in view of the constraint pn
k=1 ak = 0, we may consider
a prepotential f (a1,   , an ) which is a function of all variables ak, whose restriction
to the hyperplane pn
in terms of this prepotential
f (a1,   , an ), we have adk = 
a1f (a1,   , an ). the expressions found
in (4.28) identify the perturbative part of the prepotential

which is exactly the expression (4.13) required for the su(n) gauge theory with nf
hypermultiplets of masses mj, 1  j  nf , in the fundamental representation.

the same methods can be used to determine explicitly the successive instanton correc-
tions to the prepotential, corresponding to the successive terms o(d) in (4.23). clearly,
the only remaining ingredient we need is a full expansion of the branch points xk in terms
of uk and . for this, we recast the dening equation (4.17) for the branch points as a
xed point equation

xk = uk  s(xk )

(4.30)

(4.31)

it is now clear that we can evaluate the periods of the seiberg-witten dierential to
any order in . the answers will be in terms of the classical moduli parameters uk. to get

54

the correct prepotential, as we already saw in the determination of f pert, it is crucial that
all expressions be recast in terms of the quantum moduli ak. this can be done routinely,
since the equation (4.21) allows to write ak and uk in terms of each other. although
the calculations can become very cumbersome beyond one instanton order, the methods
are straightforward and have a certain exibility. originally developed in the context of
hyperelliptic curves [26][27], they have been now extended successfully by i.p. ennes, s.g.
naculich, h. rhedin, and h.j. schnitzer to the study of more complicated spectral curves
than (4.14). these include the ones corresponding to matter in the symmetric and the
antisymmetric representation of su(n) [28], as well as product groups [29], and other
curves arising from m theory. another method which has been used in the determination
of the prepotential from seiberg-witten curves is the method of picard-fuchs equations.
these methods give exact dierential equations satised by the periods of the seiberg-
witten dierential, but they can get complicated very quickly as the genus of the curve
increases [30].

however, the prepotential obeys a simple and remarkable renormalization group type

equation [31]

which can actually be used to determine explicitly all instanton corrections, once the
dependence of ui is known in terms of the quantum moduli ai (simpler cases of (4.32) had
been found in [32]. a broad framework for such equations had also been provided in [34],
in the context of the tau function for soliton equations).

we shall limit ourselves here to exhibiting the expression for the prepotential up to

2-instanton order, and to the cases where nf < 2n

f = f (0) + f (1) + f (2) + o(6) .

here, the function si(k; a) is as dened in (4.22), but with ui replaced by ai. there is
perfect agreement between the quantum eld theory calculations and these results derived
directly from seiberg-witten theory [26].

we note also that a set of linear recursion relations was very recently obtained for the
prepotential, from which instanton corrections to very high order may be read o almost
without calculations [35]. in a related direction, the renormalization group equation can
be imbedded into a full hierarchy of equations satised by the prepotential [34]. these
equations can also be exploited to derive instanton corrections [36]. for su(n) theories
with hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation, the prepotential has also been
shown to satisfy wdvv equations [33]. clearly, all these properties are indicative of a
deeper underlying structure which is still yet to be fully uncovered. finally, we note that
the renormalization group methods may also be used to perform systematic expansions at
strong coupling, for small values of the quantum moduli parameters [37]. these results
have found exciting applications to twisted topological supersymmetric gauge theories as
well [38]. various reviews may be found in [39].

4.4 classical gauge algebras, fundamental hypermultiplets

the curves (ui) for the other classical gauge groups so(n) and sp(n) have also been
constructed [40], and we have

a(k) = ka

yi=1

(k2  u2

b(k) = ckb

y=1

(k2  m2

(4.37)

the values of the exponents a, b and c are given in table 6.

for simplicity, we have here restricted for sp(2n) to the case where we have at least

two massless hypermultiplets. the general case was treated in [27].

in the same paper [27], it was shown that the prepotentials for the so(n) and sp(n)
cases could be simply expressed in terms of the prepotentials for the su(n) cases. one
nds for the case g = so(2n + 1),

(4.39)

and, nally, for so(2n), we have

fso(2n);nf (a1,   , an; m1,   , mnf ; )

= fsu (2n);2nf +4(a1,   , an,a1,   ,an; m1,   , mnf ,m1,   ,mnf , 0, 0, 0, 0; )

(4.40)
again, these seiberg-witten expressions agree perfectly with the perturbative results
known directly from quantum eld theory.

5 mechanical integrable systems

we consider hamiltonian mechanical systems with a nite number of degrees of freedom,
namely positions xi and momenta pi, i = 1,   , n. the hamiltonian, poisson bracket and
hamilton equations are as always

h(xi, pi)

{xi, pj} = ij

h
xi = {xi, h} =
pi
pi = {pi, h} = 

h
xi

.

(5.1)

while for the purposes of classical mechanics, these quantities and equations are customar-
ily used with real valued xi, pi and h, there is absolutely no diculty in letting xi, pi and
h be complex. for our purposes, derived from seiberg-witten theory, the natural setting
is complex analyticity and it will be crucial to allow for this complex generalization.

a hamiltonian mechanical system dened in (5.1) is (completely) integrable if and only
if there exist precisely n functionally independent integrals of motion ii(x, p), i = 1,   , n,
such that
(5.2)

ii = {ii, h} = 0

{ii, ij} = 0 .

(more precisely, the system is integrable if the rst relation holds, while it is completely
integrable when both equations hold.) for a practical guide to integrable systems, see for
example [41]. as a result of the existence of precisely as many integrals of motion as there
are position degrees of freedom xi, it is possible to perform a canonical transformation
from the variables xi, pi to action-angle variables, ii, i, i = 1,   , n, for which time
evolution is linear
(5.3)

i(t) = i(0) + ciiit

ii(t) = ii(0)

for some constants ci. in other words, for a completely integrable system, in action-angle
variables, time evolution reduces to a linear ow on an n-dimensional torus, parametrized
by the angle variables i.

there is no general classication of hamiltonians h(xi, pi) which correspond to com-
pletely integrable systems. there is also no systematic test to determine whether a given
hamiltonian h(xi, pi) is integrable or not. thus, deciding whether a given system is
integrable is a dicult and challenging problem in mechanics.

however, there is a general correspondence that has been used very fruitfully in the
study of integrable systems. this is the case whenever there exists a lax pair. a lax pair
is a pair of n  n matrix-valued functions l(x, p) and m(x, p) which depend upon the
dynamical variables x and p, such that the lax equation l = [l, m] is equivalent to the
hamilton equations of the hamiltonian mechanical system associated with h,

l = [l, m]  (cid:18) xi = {xi, h}
pi = {pi, h}(cid:19) .

58

(5.4)

the dimension n of the lax matrices is not a priori known, and there is again no systematic
test or algorithm to establish the existence of a lax pair, even less to nd it explicitly. a
lax pair is not unique, since one is always free to perform a gauge transformation on l
and m by

ls = s1ls

m s = s1ms  s1 s .

(5.5)

as soon as a lax pair is known to exist for a given hamiltonian system, integrals of
motion immediately follow. indeed, traces of powers of l are found to be time independent
as well as gauge invariant,

ii  trlni

=

ii = ni tr(lni1[l, m]) = 0 .

(5.6)

here, the traces of l can be dened for all positive integer values ni, and all such ii are
integrals of motion. however, since the matrix l is of dimension n, we know from cayleys
theorem that all ii with ni  n will be functionally dependent upon traces of lower powers.
thus, to get enough integrals of motion for complete integrability, we need n  n. for
all known integrable systems, this condition appears to be fulllled, though we are not
aware of any general theorem to that eect. amongst all traces of powers of l, we choose
n functionally independent ii, i = 1,   , n for certain choises of integers ni. in particular,
the original hamiltonian will be functionally dependent upon these integrals of motion

since it is time-independent itself.

h = h(i1,   , in)

(5.7)

5.1 lax pairs with spectral parameter - spectral curves

a stronger form of integrability which exists in many known integrable systems, is the
fact that the lax operators l and m may depend upon an additional (complex) spectral
parameter, usually denoted by z. the lax operators become then matrix-valued functions
l(z), m(z) of z. the hamiltonian h and the whole mechanical system does not depend
upon z, yet for all values of z, l(z) and m(z) are a lax pair,

l(z) = [l(z), m(z)]  (cid:18) xi = {xi, h}
pi = {pi, h}(cid:19) .

(5.8)

a lax pair l(z), m(z) obeying these relations is called a lax pair with spectral parameter.
again, there is no systematic way to establish the existence of a lax pair with spectral
parameter, and there is no algorithm for nding it, even if the system is known to be
integrable or even if a lax pair without spectral parameter is already known explicitly.

to any lax pair with spectral parameter, there is naturally associated a spectral curve,

dened by

 = {(k, z)  c  c; det (ki  l(z)) = 0} .

(5.9)

59

and a natural one-form d, dened by

d = kdz

(5.10)
while l(z) and m(z) depend upon 2r phase space variables xi and pi, i = 1,   , n,
the spectral curve is time-independent and gauge invariant and depends only upon the n
functionally independent integrals of motion ii. furthermore, if l(z) is a meromorphic
function of z (up to a gauge transformation, which may or may not be meromorphic), then
the form d is a meromorphic form on the spectral curve . depending on the periodicity
properties of the lax pair l(z), m(z) with respect to z, the domain of denition of z may
be more properly viewed as the sphere of the torus, and a dierent variable than z may
be more suitable in the denition 5.10 for the seiberg-witten dierential (examples of this
are discussed in subsequent sections). the curve  is correspondingly a branched covering
of the sphere or of the torus.

5.2 the toda systems

the non-periodic toda system is a non-relativistic system of n + 1 points on a linear chain,
with exponential nearest neighbor interactions (see for example [41]). the hamiltonian is
given by

exi+1xi .

(5.11)

h =

1
2

n+1

xi=1

i  m 2
p2

n

xi=1

by translation invariance of the xi by a common constant, it is clear that the center of

mass x0 = pi xi degree of freedom may be decoupled from the system, eectively leaving

a system of r coupled degrees of freedom. the simplest non-periodic system with n = 1
reduces to the liouville system.

the periodic toda system is a non-relativistic system of n+1 points on a circular chain,

with exponential nearest neighbor interactions, given by

h =

1
2

n+1

xi=1

p2
i  m 2

n+1

xi=1

exi+1xi ,

(5.12)

with the periodicity condition xn+2 = x1. again, the center of mass coordinate decouples
leaving a coupled system of r degrees of freedom. the simplest periodic toda system is
for n = 1 and reduces to the sine-gordon model.

actually, both toda systems admit a natural lie algebraic interpretation. this may
be seen by viewing the linear chain of the non-periodic system as the dynkin diagram for
the lie algebra an  su(n + 1), and the circular chain of the periodic toda system as
the dynkin diagram for the untwisted ane lie algebra a(1)
n . the set r of simple roots
for each lie algebra is well-known,

an
a(1)
n

ei  ei+1
ei  ei+1

i = 1,   , n
i = 1,   , n + 1,
60

er+2 = e1 .

(5.13)

in terms of the simple roots, and the vector notation for position and momentum variables,
x = (x1,   , xn+1) and p = (p1,   , pn+1), both toda hamiltonians take on a unied form,
(5.14)

ex .

h =

1
2

p2  m 2 xr

lie algebraically, the non-periodic toda system is associated with the nite dimensional
lie algebra an, while the periodic toda system is associated with the innite dimensional
untwisted ane lie algebra a(1)
n .

now, for any nite-dimensional semi-simple lie algebra g or one of the associated
untwisted g(1) or twisted ane lie algebras, we may associate a toda system based on the
set of simple roots r of the lie algebra. for a lie algebra g of rank n, we introduce the
position x = (x1,   , xn) and momentum p = (p1,   , pn) variables and dene the toda
hamiltonian associated with a lie algebra g (which may be nite dimensional or ane)
in terms of the set of simple roots r(g), as follows,
p2  m 2 xr(g)

ex .

(5.15)

h =

1
2

remarkably, this toda system is completely integrable for any lie algebra g.

in fact, for any nite dimensional lie algebra g, or its untwisted ane extension g(1),
the toda system admits a lax pair [42]. to exhibit this lax pair, we need the following
ingredients,

 h = (h1,   , hn) is the array of cartan generators of g, with [hi, hj] = 0;
 e is the generators of g associated with the root ;
 r = r(g) is the set of simple roots of g;
 0 is the ane root (to be included for g(1));
 a representation  of g, so that all generators hi, e can be viewed as n-dimensional

matrices, if  is of dimension n.

the lax matrices then take on the form

l = p  h + xr
m = 

2 xr

1

me 1

2 x(e + e) +

e

1

2 0x(ze0 + z1e0)

me 1

2 x(e  e) + 2e

1

2 0x(ze0  z1e0)

(5.16)

(5.17)

for a non-periodic toda system, associated with a nite dimensional lie algebra g,
we set  = 0 in (5.16), and any dependence on the spectral parameter z disappears. for

61

the periodic toda system, associated with the untwisted ane lie algebra g(1), we have
 6= 0, and the lax pair has a spectral parameter z.

for non-simply laced lie algebras g (i.e. for which not all roots have the same lengths),
one may also dene a toda system associated with the twisted ane lie algebra (g(1)).
the roots of this algebra are the duals (or co-roots) to the roots of g(1), and the twisted
ane toda system associated with these algebras is also integrable, and admit a lax pair
with operators given by (5.16) but with roots replaced with co-roots.

for the periodic toda systems, we have a lax pair with spectral parameter and thus
n with  the fundamental
indeed, the determinant

we have a spectral curve, as dened in (5.9). for the case of a(1)
representation, this curve may be worked out more explicitly.
that enters (5.9) is

det(ki  l(z)) = a(k) 

1
2

(z +

2
z

) .

(5.18)

the simplicity of the z-dependence is due to the fact that the generators e0 and e0
are matrices of rank 1, so that their coecients enter linearly in the expansion of the
determinant. the remaining polynomial a(k) is independent of z and is of degree n =
n + 1. since trl = 0, and k multiplies the identity matrix, the form of a(k) is

a(k) = kn + kn2j2 + kn3j3 +    + jn =

n

yi=1

(k  ui)

(5.19)

where the parameters ji are functions of the integrals of motion ii = trli only. the
integrals of motion can in principle be expressed in terms of the dynamical variables xi
and pi, but we shall not need these relations here.

by a change of variables, y = z  a(k), the equation for the curve (5.9) may be

evaluated explicitly using (5.19), and we get

 = {(k, y)  c  c,

y2 = a(k)2  2} .

(5.20)

remarkably, this curve is identical to the seiberg-witten curve for an n = 2 supersym-
metric su(n) gauge theory without hypermultiplets.
in fact, also the seiberg-witten
dierential admits a very simple expression, given by

d = kd ln z =

a(k)kdk

qa(k)2  2

.

(5.21)

the coincidence of the spectral curves of toda systems and the seiberg-witten curves of
n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory was rst noted in [43], in the case of su(2)
without matter hypermultiplets. it is natural to speculate that, for all gauge groups g, a
similar correspondence should hold between toda systems and seiberg-witten curves of
n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theories without matter hypermultiplets, for all gauge

62

groups. however, due to subtleties related to the renormalization group ow, the correct
correspondence is rather between toda systems for the dual group (g(1)) and the g yang-
mills theory, as shown in [44]. we shall come back in 6 to this emergence of the dual
group (g(1)), in the context of calogero-moser systems.

5.3 the calogero-moser systems for su(n)

the calogero-moser systems are non-relativistic mechanical models of n + 1 particles on
a (complex line) with two body interactions, which are not limited to nearest neighbor
interactions. the original calogero-moser system comes in three varieties [45]

(xi  xj; 1, 2)

(5.22)

(5.23)

(5.24)

as is clear from the above denitions, the interaction potential of the rational and
trigonometric systems is a rational and trigonometric (or simply periodic) function re-
spectively, while for the elliptic systems, the potential is the weierstrass elliptic (doubly
periodic) function dened by

(x; 1, 2) 

1

x2 + x(m,n)6=(0,0)(cid:18)

1

(x + 2m1 + 2n2)2 

1

(2m1 + 2n2)2(cid:19) .

(5.25)

here, 21 and 22 are the periods, and  may be thought of as the electric eld due to
an electric dipole of unit strength on a torus with sides 21 and 22. the three systems
are related by the following limits : as 2   with 1 xed, the elliptic system tends
to the trigonometric one, while as in addition 1  , the system tends to the rational
case. in view of these limiting relations, it suces to carry out our analysis of integrability
and construction of lax pairs (with spectral parameter) for the elliptic calogero-moser
systems. integrability is preserved under these limits and will smoothly carry over to the
trigonometric and rational cases.

63

it turns out also that the elliptic calogero-moser system is the system of interest for
seiberg-witten theory. an important clue is the microscopic gauge coupling  of (2.59).
in theories where this microscopic gauge coupling does not get renormalized, it can be
expected to play a central role in the prepotential and hence in the seiberg-witten curves.
thus for theories such as super yang-mills with matter in the adjoint representation (so
that the beta function vanishes, in view of (3.7)), the correct corresponding integrable
model should involve a torus with moduli  . this requirement is satised by the calogero-
moser systems in their elliptic versions, but not in their rational or trigonometric versions.
the latter versions have appeared however in many other physical contexts. we refer to
[46] for some recent applications.

the calogero-moser systems are naturally interpreted in terms of an = su(n + 1)
in an orthonormal basis ei,

lie algebra data. consider the set r of all roots of an;
i = 1,   , n + 1, they are given by

r(an) = {ei  ej,

i 6= j = 1,   , n + 1} .

(5.26)

in terms of the set of all roots of an and the position x = (x1,   , xn+1) and momentum
p = (p1,   , pn+1) variables, we can recast the hamiltonian as follows

h =

1
2

p2 

1
2

m2 xr

(  x; 1, 2)

(5.27)

it is easy to generalize the above hamiltonian to other lie algebras, but we shall postpone
this discussion to 6, since a great number of subtleties arise in the integrability properties
of these systems.

the elliptic calogero-moser system for g = an = su(n + 1) admits a lax pair with

spectral parameter z, rst derived in [47],

lij(z) = piij  m(1  ij)(xi  xj; z)
mij(z) = di(x)ij + m(1  ij)(xi  xj; z) .

(5.28)

(5.29)

here di(x) = mpk6=i (xi  xk), (x; z) = x(x; z), and (x; z) is a lame function,

given by

(x; z) =

ex(z)

(5.30)

(z  x)
(x)(z)

where the weierstrass function  is related to  by (z) = (z) and (z) = (z)/(z).
the lame function (x; z) satises the lame equation,

(cid:18) d2
dz2  (x)(cid:19)(x; z) = 2(z)(x; z) .

(5.31)

this lax pair and the corresponding spectral curve has sparked a rich theory of elliptic
solitons and spectral covers. we refer to [48] [49] for some of these developments. complete

64

integrability and the existence of a classical r-matrix has been investigated in [50] and
[51]. for us, the above lax pair will be of fundamental importance for a dierent reason:
the associated spectral curve and dierential d = kdz will turn out to give exactly the
seiberg-witten curve for the su(n) n = 2 super-yang-mills theory, with a hypermultiplet
in the adjoint representation.

5.4 relation between calogero-moser and toda for su(n)

remarkably, toda systems may be obtained as a limit of elliptic calogero-moser systems
[52]. qualitatively, the limit is expected to arise as follows : in calogero-moser systems,
all roots of the algebra are being summed over, while for toda systems, only the simple
roots enter. thus, upon taking the limit, all interactions that are not nearest neighbor
must vanish, leaving only the nearest neighbor interaction of simple roots.

the limit is taken on the parameters m, 2 and on the position variables xi by letting

1 = i and

re(2)  

(5.32)

m = me2
xj = xj + 22  j
m, xj, 0 <   1

n xed




a very convenient way to investigate the limit is to expand the -function in terms of
trigonometric functions

(x;i; 2) =

1
2



xk=

1

ch(x + 2k2)  1

.

(5.33)

(for a derivation of this formula, see appendix c). since (x; 1, 2) is even in x, we
restrict to i < j without loss of generality and we have

m2(xi  xj;i, 22) =

1
2



xk=

m 2e22

ch[xi  xj + 22((i  j) + k)]  1

.

(5.34)

when  > 1/n, it is easy to see that no limit will exist, which is why we have excluded
this case from the outset in (5.32).

because we have 0 <   1/n all terms in the innite sum (5.34), except n = 0, 1,

converge to 0. the limits of the remaining terms are

and

k = 0 term  (cid:26) m 2 exp(xj  xi)

0

j  i = 1
j  i 6= 1

k = 1 term  (cid:26) m 2 exp(xn  x1)

0

n = 1
n < 1

.

(5.35)

(5.36)

the contribution from the k = 0 term emerges for any values of , and it should be manifest
that this limit precisely corresponds to the toda exponential interaction between nearest

65

neighbors, i.e. based on the simple roots of an = su(n + 1). the contribution from the
k = 1 term on the other hand is absent for all values n < 1. in this case, the limiting
toda system is based only on the simple roots of an and corresponds to the non-periodic
case. when n = 1 on the other hand, the k = 1 term survives and yields the toda
exponential interaction for the ane root 0. in this case, the limiting toda system is
based on the simple roots of an as well as the ane root 0, and corresponds to the
periodic toda system, associated with the untwisted ane lie algebra a(1)
n . in summary

5.5 relations with kdv and kp systems

n

(5.37)

the toda and calogero-moser systems are also connected with higher dimensional inte-
grable systems. some remarkable connections are:

 toda field theory : the basic elds are  = (1,   , n) with i(t, x) 2-dimensional

elds,  = (t, x), and lagrangian

l =

1
2

    m 2 xr

e .

(5.38)

these theories are integrable as eld theories and the simplest cases are liouville
theory, which enters into the study of non-critical string theory and two-dimensional
quantum gravity [53], as well as sine-gordon theory which is equivalent to the mas-
sive thirring model of fermions [54].

 korteweg-de vries (kdv) equation : the fundamental eld is a single scalar u(t, x)

in 2 dimensions and the eld equation is

of special interest are rational solutions, which are of the form

tu = 6uxu  3
xu

u(t, x) = 2xj

1

(x  xj(t))2 .

(5.39)

(5.40)

by a theorem of airault-mckean-moser [55], this ansatz for u solves the kdv equa-
tion provided the positions xj(t) are subject to certain constraints as well as to the
following time-evolution equation [47]

where l is the lax operator for the rational calogero-moser system.

txj = {xj, trl3}

(5.41)

 kadomzev-petviashvili (kp) equation : the fundamental eld is a scalar u(t, t, x)

in three dimensions (one space and two times) with the eld equation

32

tu = x(tu  6uxu  3

xu) .

(5.42)

the t-independent solutions are governed by the kdv equation. it has been shown
by krichever [47] that the elliptic solutions are of the form

u(t, t, x) = 2xj

(x  xj(t, t))

provided the positions xj(t, t) obey the following time-evolution equations

txj = {xj, trl3}

txj = {xj, trl2}

where l is the lax operator for the elliptic calogero-moser system.

(5.43)

(5.44)

so far, these properties have not yet entered directly into the connection between integrable
systems and seiberg-witten theory. however, it is now known that the symplectic forms
arising in seiberg-witten theory from the dierential d can be viewed as restrictions to
the space of algebraic-geometric solutions of symplectic forms for soliton equations [56][57].
it is likely that more connections will emerge in the near future.

5.6 calogero-moser systems for general lie algebras

as olshanetsky and perelomov [58] realized very early on, the hamiltonian system (3.1)
is only one example of a whole series of hamiltonian systems associated with each simple
lie algebra. more precisely, given any simple lie algebra g, olshanetsky and perelomov
[58] introduced the system with hamiltonian

h(x, p) =

1
2

n

xi=1

p2
i 

1

2 xr(g)

m2
||(  x),

(5.45)

where n is the rank of g, r(g) denotes the set of roots of g, and the m|| are mass
parameters. to preserve the invariance of the hamiltonian (3.5) under the weyl group,
the parameters m|| depend only on the orbit || of the root , and not on the root 
itself. (for an1 = su(n), it is common practice as we saw earlier to use n pairs of
dynamical variables (xi, pi), since the roots of an1 lie conveniently on a hyperplane in
cn . the dynamics of the system are unaected if we shift all xi by a constant, and
the number of degrees of freedom is eectively n  1 = n.) as in the original su(n)
case, the elliptic systems (3.5) admit rational and trigonometric limits. olshanetsky and
perelomov succeeded in constructing a lax pair for all these systems in the case of classical
lie algebras, albeit without spectral parameter [58].

67

twisted calogero-moser systems dened by lie algebras

it turns out that the hamiltonian systems (5.45) are not the only natural extensions
of the basic elliptic calogero-moser system. a subtlety arises for simple lie algebras g
which are not simply-laced, i.e., algebras which admit roots of uneven length. this is the
case for the algebras bn, cn, g2, and f4 in cartans classication. for these algebras,
the following twisted elliptic calogero-moser systems were introduced by the authors in
[59, 60]

here the function () depends only on the length of the root . if g is simply-laced, we
set () = 1 identically. otherwise, for g non simply-laced, we set () = 1 when  is a
long root, () = 2 when  is a short root and g is one of the algebras bn, cn, or f4, and
() = 3 when  is a short root and g = g2. the twisted weierstrass function (z) is
dened by

),

(5.47)

where a is any of the half-periods 1, 2, or 1 + 2. thus the twisted and untwisted
calogero-moser systems coincide for g simply laced. for g = bn, cn, the twisted
calogero-moser models introduced here are equivalent to the systems introduced by in-
ozemtsev [52], while for g = f4, g2, they are new integrable systems. the original
motivation for twisted calogero-moser systems was based on their scaling limits (which
will be discussed in the next section) [59, 60].

5.7 scaling of calogero-moser to toda for general lie algebras

the key feature of the scaling limit of the su(n) calogero-moser system to the su(n)
toda system was the collapse of the sum over the entire root lattice of an1 in the
calogero-moser hamiltonian to the sum over only simple roots in the toda hamiltonian
for the kac-moody algebra a(1)
n1. our task is to extend this mechanism to general lie
algebras. it turns out that there are two possible extensions, depending on whether we
use the coxeter number or the dual coxeter number [60].

scaling limits based on the coxeter number

for this, we consider the following generalization of the preceding scaling limit

2 ,

m = mq 1
x = x  22,

(5.48)
(5.49)

here x = (xi), x = (xi) and  are n-dimensional vectors. the vector x is the dynamical
variable of the calogero-moser system. the parameters  and  depend on the algebra

68

g and are yet to be chosen. as for m and x, they have the same interpretation as
earlier, namely as respectively the mass parameter and the dynamical variables of the
limiting system. setting 1 = i, the contribution of each root  to the calogero-moser
potential can be expressed as

m2(  x) =

1
2

m 2 
xk=

e22

ch(  x  2k2)  1

(5.50)

it suces to consider positive roots . we shall also assume that 0       1.
the contributions of the k = 0 and k = 1 summands in (5.50) are proportional to
exp{22(     )} and exp{22(  1 +    )} respectively. thus the existence of a
nite scaling limit requires that

       1  .

(5.51)

let i, 1  i  n be a basis of simple roots for g. if we want all simple roots i to survive
in the limit, we must require that

i   = 1, 1  i  n.

(5.52)

this condition characterizes the vector  as the level vector. next, the second condition
in (5.51) can be rewritten as {1 + max (  )}  1. but

hg = 1 + max



(  )

(5.53)

is precisely the coxeter number of g, and we must have   1
, the
contributions of all the roots except for the simple roots of g tend to 0. on the other
hand, when  = 1
, the highest root 0 realizing the maximum over  in (5.53) survives.
hg
since 0 is the additional simple root for the ane lie algebra g(1), we arrive in this
way at the following theorem, which was proved in [60]

. thus when  < 1
hg

theorem 1. under the limit (5.48), with  = 1
, and  given by the level vector, the
hg
hamiltonian of the elliptic calogero-moser system for the simple lie algebra g tends to
the hamiltonian of the toda system for the ane lie algebra g(1).
scaling limit based on the dual coxeter number

if the seiberg-witten spectral curve of the n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory with
a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation is to be realized as the spectral curve for a
calogero-moser system, the parameter m in the calogero-moser system should correspond
to the mass of the hypermultiplet. in the gauge theory, the dependence of the coupling
constant on the mass m is given by

69

m = mq 1

(5.54)

where h
g is the quadratic casimir of the lie algebra g. this shows that the correct
physical limit, expressing the decoupling of the hypermultiplet as it becomes innitely
massive, is given by (5.48), but with  = 1
. to establish a closer parallel with our
h

preceding discussion, we recall that the quadratic casimir h
g coincides with the dual
coxeter number of g, dened by

is the well-known weyl vector.

for simply laced lie algebras g (ade algebras), we have hg = h

g, and the preceding
scaling limits apply. however, for non simply-laced algebras (bn, cn, g2, f4), we have
hg > h
g, and our earlier considerations show that the untwisted elliptic calogero-moser
hamiltonians do not tend to a nite limit under (5.48), q  0, m is kept xed. this is
why the twisted hamiltonian systems (5.46) have to be introduced. the twisting produces
precisely to an improvement in the asymptotic behavior of the potential which allows a
nite, non-trivial limit. more precisely, we can write

m2(x) =

2
2



xn=

m2

ch (x  2n2)  1

.

(5.57)

setting x = x  22, we obtain the following asymptotics
m2(x) = 2m 2( e22()x + e22(1)+x,

e22()x,

if  is long;
if  is short.

(5.58)

this leads to the following theorem [60]

, m = mq1/(2h

g ), with  the weyl vector
theorem 2. under the limit x = x + 22
and q  0, the hamiltonian of the twisted elliptic calogero-moser system for the simple
lie algebra g tends to the hamiltonian of the toda system for the ane lie algebra (g(1)).
so far we have discussed only the scaling limits of the hamiltonians. however, similar
arguments show that the lax pairs constructed below also have nite, non-trivial scaling
limits whenever this is the case for the hamiltonians. the spectral parameter z should
scale as ez = zq
2 , with z xed. the parameter z can be identied with the loop group
parameter for the resulting ane toda system.

6 calogero-moser lax pairs for general lie algebras

while the lax pair for the elliptic su(n) calogero-moser system was constructed [47]
shortly after the proposal of the calogero-moser systems was made [58], the lax pairs
l(z), m(z) for elliptic calogero-moser systems associated with general lie algebras were
constructed only recently [59].

the key complication encountered when passing from su(n) to other lie algebras is
the following. for su(n), the lax operators l and m are n  n matrices, and thus
belong to the (complexied) lie algebra of su(n).
in other words, the existence and
calculation of a lax pair is essentially a problem in the lie algebra of su(n). for general
lie algebra g however, it will turn out that l and m cannot belong to g for generic values
of the spectral parameter. thus, the problem of the existence and calculation of the lax
pairs becomes a problem in a more general algebra in which g will have to be embedded.
before presenting the lax pairs with spectral parameter for general simple lie algebras,
we describe them rst in a concrete and relatively simpler case, namely when g is one of
the classical algebras bn, cn, or dn, and the elliptic calogero-moser system is untwisted.
in these cases, the operators l(z) and m(z) have a suggestive expression in terms of
matrices.

6.1 lax pairs with spectral parameter for classical lie algebras

following olshanetsky and perelomov [58], it is convenient to consider the lax pair for the
root system r(bcn)  r(bn)r(cn), although this set is not strictly speaking the root
system of an algebra. the expression (5.45) denes then the corresponding (untwisted)
elliptic calogero-moser system, with mass parameters m1, m2, and m4. the cases bn, cn,
and dn are recovered with the following choices of masses

bn
cn
dn

m4 = 0
m1 = 0
m1 = m4 = 0

(6.1)

we claim that the elliptic calogero-moser system associated to r(bcn) is integrable and
admits a lax pair with spectral parameter if
1  2m2

2 + 2 m2m4) = 0

m1(m2

(6.2)

in this case, the lax pair l(z), m(z) is of the form

l(z) = p + x,

m(z) = d + y

(6.3)

here the matrices p, x, d, y are all (2n + 1)  (2n + 1) dimensional, with p, d diagonal
matrices

p = diag(p1,   , pn;p1,   ,pn; 0)

71

d = diag(d1,   , dn; +d1,   , +dn; 0)

and x, y of the form

b1ij = m2(1  ij)(xi + xj, z) + 2 m4ij(2xi, z)
b2ij = m2(1  ij)(xi  xj, z) + 2 m4ij(2xi, z)
c1i = m1(xi, z)
c2i = m1(xi, z)

(6.7)

and those of the matrix y are given by similar formulas, with a, b, c, and (x, z) replaced
respectively by a, b, c, and (x, z). we note that for z = a, where a is one of the
half periods, then the preceding lax pair reduces to the one found by olshanetsky and
perelomov [58].

the matrices l(z), m(z) can now be veried directly to be a lax pair by calculation.
however, as preparation for the general ansatz for the lax pair for general simple lie
algebras, we note that they arise by the following representation theoretic construction.
the verication that they form a lax pair for the elliptic bcn calogero-moser system can
then be carried out in the general framework provided in the next section 6.2.

we embed g = bn into gl(n, c), with n = 2n + 1, by embedding the fundamental
representation of bn into the fundamental representation of gl(n, c). the weights of bn
obtained by the decomposition of the adjoint representation of gl(n, c) automatically
contain all the roots of the bcn system. let i, 1  i  n, be the weights of the
fundamental representation of bn. in terms of an orthonormal basis of vectors ei, 1  i 
n, we have
(6.8)
let ui, 1  i  n, be the weights of the fundamental representation of gl(n, c). they
are vectors in cn . they can be veried to decompose orthogonally as

i+n = ei

1  i  n;

2n+1 = 0.

i = ei;

2 ui = i + vi,

72

(6.9)

for vectors vi which are orthogonal to j, and satisfy vi = vi+n, 1  i  n. we can deduce
the decomposition of the roots of gl(n, c) into weights of bn. there are three orbits,
consisting of the weights of bn with length2 = 2, which may be viewed as the roots of dn

2 (ui  uj) = ei  ej + vi  vj
2 (un+j  un+i) = ei  ej  vi + vj
2 (ui  un+j) = ei + ej + vi  vj
2 (un+i  uj) = ei  ej + vi  vj,

i 6= j,

(6.10)

the weights of length2 = 4 (additional roots of cn)

2 (ui  un+i) = 2ei
2 (un+i  ui) = 2ei

and the weights of length2 = 1 (additional roots of bn)

2 (ui  un ) = ei + vi  v2n+1
2 (un  un+i) = ei  vi + v2n+1
2 (un+i  un ) = ei + vi  v2n+1
2 (un  ui) = ei  vi + v2n+1

(6.11)

(6.12)

then the matrices x, y are of the form

x = xr(bcn)
y = xr(bcn)

cij eij )

(  x)( xij =
(  x)( xij =

cijeij )

(6.13)

where the matrices eij are given by (eij )lm = iljm , and cij are constants proportional
to the masses m1, m2, and m4.

we can now generalize this set up to the case of an arbitrary simple lie algebra g.

6.2 the general ansatz
let the rank of g be n, and d be its dimension. let  be a representation of g of dimension
n, of weights i, 1  i  n. we x a cartan subalgebra h for gl(n, c) which contains
the cartan subalgebra hg of g. a basis for h consists then of a basis hi, 1  i  n,
of cartan generators for g, together with a complementary set hi, n + 1  i  n, of
generators of gl(n, c) satisfying [hi, hj] = [hi, hj] = [hi, hj] = 0. by adding to the hi
suitable linear combinations of the hi, we may assume that the hi and hi are mutually
orthogonal with respect to the cartan-killing form tr[adhi, adhj

] = 0.

73

let ui  cn be the weights of the fundamental representation of gl(n, c). project

orthogonally the uis onto the is as

sui = i + vi , i  vj .

(6.14)

the coecient s is determined by the normalizations of the various weights. let ei,
1  i  n, be an orthonormal basis for the weight space of g, and set i = pn
i=1 iiei.
then s ui ek = i ek = ik. in particular, the vector s ek, viewed as a vector in the weight
space of gl(n, c) can be expressed as s ek = pn
i=1 ikui. squaring
and summing over k gives

i=1(s ek  ui) ui = pn

s2 =

2
i = i2()

(6.15)

n

n

xi=1

where i2() is by denition the second dynkin index of the representation  of g. we
note that
(6.16)
is a weight of    associated to the root ui  uj of gl(n, c). more precisely, let
eij = uiut
j be the usual generators for gl(n, c). then the basic commutation relations
in terms of eij , hi, hi are

ij = i  j

[eij , ekl] = jkeil  ilekj

(6.17)

[h, eij ] = (i  j )eij ,

(6.18)
the generators eii form an alternative basis for h. comparing the commutators of eii
and (h, h) with eij , i 6= j, we obtain easily the relation between eii and (h, h)

[h, eij] = (vi  vj )eij

eii =

1
s2 (i  h + vi  h)

(6.19)

the centralizer of hg in gl(n, c) may be larger that the cartan subalgebra h of
gl(n, c). we denote it by h  gl0. for all simple lie algebras in their lowest di-
mensional faithful representation, we have gl0 = 0, except in the cases of f4 and e8,
where the dimension of gl0 is 2 and 56 respectively.

the lax pairs for both untwisted and twisted calogero-moser systems will be of the

form

l = p + x, m = d + y,

(6.20)

where the matrices p, x, d, and y are given by

x = xi6=j

cij ij (ij , z)eij ,

y = xi6=j

cij ij (ij , z)eij

(6.21)

and by

p = p  h, d = d  (h  h) + .

(6.22)

74

here  is an element of gl0. the functions ij (x, z) and the coecients cij are yet to be
determined. we begin by stating the necessary and sucient conditions for the pair l(z),
m(z) of (4.1) to be a lax pair for the (twisted or untwisted) calogero-moser systems. for
this, it is convenient to introduce the following notation

ij = ij (ij  x), ij = ij (ij  x)
ij = ij (ij  x, z)ji (ij  x, z)  ij (ij  x, z)ji (ij  x, z).

(6.23)
(6.24)

then the lax equation l(z) = [l(z), m(z)] implies the calogero-moser system if and only
if the following three identities are satised

xi6=j

cijcjiij ij = s2 xr(g)

m2
||()(  x)

cij cjiij (vi  vj ) = 0

xi6=j

(6.25)

(6.26)

ij ckjkj

xk6=i,j

cikckj(ikkj  ikkj ) = scij ij d  (ui  uj) + xk6=i,j

cikikkj

(6.27)

 xk6=i,j

in fact, applying the commutation relations (6.17) shows readily that the conditions
x = [p, y ] and x = p are equivalent. the remaining terms in the equation l = [l, m]
p = [x, y ]h and [x, y ]gl(n,c)h + [x, d] = 0. now the
decompose into two equations,
commutator [x, y ] is given by

[x, y ] = xj /{i,l}

cijcjl(ij jl  ij jl)eil

(6.28)

the component [x, y ]h is obtained by retaining only the terms eii. expressing eii in
terms of (h, h) as in (6.19), we nd that the equation p = [x, y ]h is equivalent to

p  h =

1

s2 xi6=j

cijcjiij(i  h + vi  h).

(6.29)

in view of (6.23), ij = ji , and we may antisymmetrize in i and j. since h, h are
linearly independent, the resulting equation can only hold if the second identity (6.26)
is satised. assuming this, the equation reduces then to the calogero-moser equation of
motion

p =

||()(  x)
m2

(6.30)

1

2 xr(g)

if the rst identity (6.25) is imposed. finally, the terms in the third identity (6.27) are rec-
ognized as just the coecients of eij , i 6= j, in [x, y ]gl(n,c)h, [d (h h, x], and [, x]

75

respectively. thus the identity (6.27) is equivalent to the vanishing of [x, y ]gl(n,c)h +
[x, d], completing the argument.

the following theorem was established in [59]:

theorem 3. a representation , functions ij , and coecients cij with a spectral
parameter z satisfying (6.25), (6.26), (6.27) can be found for all twisted and untwisted
elliptic calogero-moser systems associated with a simple lie algebra g, except possibly in
the case of twisted g2. in the case of e8, we have to assume the existence of a 1-valued
cocycle.

6.3 lax pairs for untwisted calogero-moser systems

returning to the case of the untwisted elliptic calogero-moser system for the bcn system,
we can now at the same stroke explain how the matrices (6.13) are found, and verify that
they lead to a lax pair. given the ansatz (6.3), the embedding of the fundamental
representation of bn into the fundamental representation of gl(n, c) (n = 2n + 1)
described in 6.1, and the choice ij (x, z) = (x, z) for all i, j, the main issue reduces to
the existence and determination of the constants cij .

for each i 6= j, there are two distinct roots of gl(n, c) which project to ei  ej,

namely 2(ui  uj) and 2(un+j  un+i). the conditions (6.25) and (6.26) become

2m2

2 = c 2
0 = c 2

n+j,n+i

ij + c 2
ij(vi  vj) + c 2

n+j,n+i(vi + vj)

(6.31)

similar equations are obtained for the roots ei + ej. using the linear independence of the
vectors vi, we nd the conditions

ij = c 2

n+i,n+j = c 2

n+i,j

m2
2m2
m2

2 = c 2
4 = c 2
1 = c 2

i,n+i
in = c 2

n+i,n

these equations can be solved by taking

m2 = cij = cn+i,n+j = cn+i,j
2m4 = ci,n+i
m1 = cin = cn+i,n

(6.32)

(6.33)

with this choice of coecients cij, we turn to the third condition (6.27). letting i and
j = j;
j take values between 1 and n, there are 6 cases to be considered: (1) i = i,

76

j = n; (3) i = i,

j = n + i; (5)
(2) i = i,
i = n,
j = n + j. we set d ei = 0. then case (4) is
satised, cases (3) and (6) give the same equations as case (1), and case (5) gives the same
equation as case (2). the cases (1) and (2) themselves lead to the following equations

j = n + j with i 6= j; (4) i = i,

j = n + j; and (6) i = n + i,

m2d  (vi  vj) = xk6=i,j

m1d  (vi  vn ) = xk6=i

+m2

m2
2[(xi  xj)  (xk  xj) + (xi + xk)  (xk + xj)]
1[(xi)  (xj)] + 2m2m4[(2xi)  (2xj)],
m1m2[(xi  xj) + (xi + xk)  2(xk)]

+2m1m4[(2xi)  (xi)]

(6.34)

we may assume that m2 6= 0, since otherwise the system decomposes trivially into a set
of non-interacting one-dimensional systems. then the most general solution of the rst
equation in the preceding condition is

d  vi = d0 +

m2
1
m2

(xi) + 2m4(2xi) +xk6=i

m2[(xi  xk) + (xi + xk)]

(6.35)

where d0 is an arbitrary function of x which is independent of i. substituting this into the
second equation yields

m1d  vn = m1d0 + m1(2m2 + 2m4 +

m2
1
m2

)(xi) + 2m1m2xk

(xk)

(6.36)

since the left hand side is independent of i, our construction works only when m1(m2
1 
2 +2m2m4) = 0, which is the condition we stated earlier in 6.1. when it is satised,
2m2
a vector d can clearly be found. choosing d0 so that d  vn = 0, we obtain the lax pair
announced previously for the bcn system.

we summarize now some important features of the lax pairs we obtain in theorem 3.

 in the case of the untwisted calogero-moser systems, we can choose ij (x, z) =

(x, z), ij (x) = (x) for all g.
  = 0 for all g, except for e8.
 for an, the lax pair (6.20) corresponds to the choice of the fundamental represen-
tation for . a dierent lax pair can be found by taking  to be the antisymmetric
representation.

 as we saw before, for the bcn system, the lax pair is obtained by imbedding bn in
gl(n, c) with n = 2n + 1. when z = a (half-period), the lax pair obtained this
way reduces to the lax pair obtained by olshanetsky and perelomov [58].

77

 for the bn and dn systems, additional lax pairs with spectral parameter can be

found by taking  to be the spinor representation.

 for g2, a rst lax pair with spectral parameter can be obtained by the above
construction with  chosen to be the 7 of g2. a second lax pair with spectral
parameter can be obtained by restricting the 8 of b3 to the 7  1 of g2.

 for f4, a lax pair can be obtained by taking  to be the 26  1 of f4, viewed as

the restriction of the 27 of e6 to its f4 subalgebra.

 for e6,  is the 27 representation.
 for e7,  is the 56 representation.
 for e8, a lax pair with spectral parameter can be constructed with  given by
the 248 representation, if coecients cij = 1 exist with the following cocycle
conditions

c(,   )c(  , ) = c(,  + )c( + , )

when    =    = 1,    = 0

when    =    = 1,    = 0

c(, )c(  , ) = c(,   )

c(, )c(,   ) = c(  ,)
when    = 1.

the matrix  in the lax pair is then the 8  8 matrix given by

m2

aa = xa=1

(c(a, )c(, b) + c(a, a  )c(a  , b))(  x)

explicit expressions for the constants cij and the functions d(x), and thus for the lax
pair are particularly simple when the representation  consists of only a single weyl orbit
of weights. this is the case when  is either

 the dening representation of an, cn or dn;
 any rank p totally anti-symmetric representation of an;
 an irreducible fundamental spinor representation of bn or dn;
 the 27 of e6; the 56 of e7.
then, the weights  and  of  provide unique labels instead of i and j, and the values

of cij = c are given by a simple formula

table 7: weyl orbit structure of 27  27 of e6.

we shall require the following simple property of the roots  and weights  of e6 in

the 27 representation:

   = weight     = 1

when    is not a weight,    = 0. to see this, we note that |  |  23  2 < 2,
since all weights  of 27 satisfy 2 = 4
3. as    is an integer, it can only assume the
values 0, 1 or 1. if   =  is a weight, then     = 2. since    {0,1}, we
must have    = 1. the argument for  +  is similar. the reverse implication in (6.57)
is a basic fact of the theory of lie algebras.

(6.57)

we return now to the construction of the lax pair. since e6 is simply laced, ij (x) =
(x) for all i, j. with cij given by (6.44), the rst condition (6.25) for a lax pair reduces
to

xr(g)

(  x) xij =

1 = s2 xr(g)

(  x)

(6.58)

80

however, it follows from (6.15) that s2 = 1

627  4

3 = 6. on the other hand, for all roots

, the multiplicity pij = 1 of the weyl orbit is also 6. thus the condition (6.25) is

satised.

to obtain the second condition (6.26), it suces to verify that

xij =

(vi  vj ) = 0

for each root . pairing the left hand side with an arbitrary vector uk gives

xij =

(vi  vj )  uk = xij =

(s(ik  jk) 

1
s

  k)

(6.59)

(6.60)

using again the fact that s2 and the multiplicity of the weyl orbit are both 6, this can be
rewritten as

xij =

(vi  vj )  uk = 6(cid:26)( xij =

(ik  jk))    k(cid:27)

(6.61)

when   k = 0,    is not a weight, and both expressions on the right hand side of
(6.61) vanish. when  k = 1, there exists a unique weight so that k   is a weight.
thus both expressions on the right hand side of (6.61) are 1, and the right hand side
still vanishes. this establishes (6.26).

recall that in the case of e6, we choose  = 0 and ij (x, z) = (x, z) for all i, j,
i 6= j. in view of the key identity (11.30) for (x, z), the third identity (6.27) for the lax
pair can be rewritten as

6cij d  (ui  uj ) = m22[x[(ik  x) x (kj  x)],

(6.62)

where both sums on the right hand side are restricted to those k 6= i, j for which i  k
and k  j are both roots. this implies that (i  k)2 = (j  k)2 = 2, and hence
i  k = j  k = 1
3.

we consider separately the two possibilities where (i  j )2 = 4 and (i  j )2 = 2.
in the rst case, i  j is not a root, and cij = 0. in particular, (i  j )2 = 4,
and hence i  j =  2
3 . by setting  = i  k, the rst sum on the right of (6.62) can
be viewed as the sum over all roots  with   i = 1,   j = 1. indeed, in this case,
i  j is not a root, and the restriction k 6= i, j is automatically satised. furthermore,
  i = i  i  k  i = 1,   j = i  j  k  j = 1. conversely, a root 
with these properties can be written as  = i  k = k  j . similarly, by introducing
 = k  j , the second sum on the right of (6.62) can be viewed as the sum over all
roots  with   i = 1,   j = 1. the right hand side of (6.62) becomes

xi =j =1

(  x)  xi =j =1

(  x),

(6.63)

81

which vanishes since (x) is even. thus the third condition for the lax pair is satised
when i  j is not a root.

assume now that i  j is a root. then (i  j )2 = 2 and i  j = 1

3. introducing
 = i  k and arguing as before, we can view the rst sum on the right hand side of
(6.62) as the sum over all roots  with  i = 1,  j = 0, and  6= i  j . expressing
the other sum in the same way, we obtain

6m2d  (ui  uj ) = m22( xi =1,j =0

(  x)  xj =1,i =0

(  x))

(6.64)

where we have added and subtracted the terms corresponding to  = i  j . now recall
that the only possible values for    are 0 or 1. thus the above right hand side can be
rewritten as
(6.65)

(  x)

m22( xi =1

(  x)  xj =1

up to the following combination of terms

 m2(

xi =1;j =1

(  x) 

xi =1;j =1

(  x)).

(6.66)

but in this last combination, the terms with i = j = 1 cancel out. the remaining
sums are over   i =   j = 1 and   i =   j = 1 respectively. since the function
(x) is even, the ip    shows that the expression (6.66) cancels. thus the third
condition for the lax pair is satised by setting d  ui = m2pi =1 (  x), which is
the prescription we gave earlier.

6.4 lax pairs for twisted calogero-moser systems

recall that the twisted and untwisted calogero-moser systems dier only for non-simply
laced lie algebras, namely bn, cn, g2 and f4. these are the only algebras we discuss
in this paragraph. the construction (6.20) gives then lax pairs for all of them, with the
possible exception of twisted g2. unlike the case of untwisted lie algebras however, the
functions ij have to be chosen with care, and dier for each algebra. more specically,

 for bn, the lax pair is of dimension n = 2n, admits two independent couplings m1

and m2, and

ij (x, z) = ( (x, z),
2x, z),

2( 1

if i  j 6= 0,n
if i  j = n

(6.78)

 for f4, the lax pair is of dimension n = 24, two independent couplings m1 and m2,

where the function 1(x, z) is dened by

(x, z) =

1(x, z),
2( 1

if    = 0;
if    = 1
2;
if    = 1.

1(x, z) = (x, z)  ei(z)+1z(x + 1, z)

here it is more convenient to label the entries of the lax pair directly by the weights
 = i and  = j instead of i and j. the vector d and coecients cij are given
by

here [] is the classication of the 24 short roots of f4 into 8v, 8s, and 8c introduced
in the previous section.

 for g2, candidate lax pairs can be dened in the 6 and 8 representations of g2,
but it is still unknown whether elliptic functions ij (x, z) exist which satisfy the
required identities.

we illustrate the construction of lax pairs for twisted calogero-moser systems by
reproducing here the construction of [59] in the simplest case of bn. since we are dealing
here with the twisted calogero-moser system for a non-simply laced algebra, we let g =
bn , and choose  to be the fundamental representation of bn , which is of dimension
n = 2n. the weights  of  are

i = i+n = ei,

1  i  n.

(6.81)

via the ansatz described in (6.25-6.27), the representation  is imbedded in gl(n, c)
with s2 = 2, and

2 ui = ei + vi, 2 un+i = ei + vi,

1  i  n.

the roots of gl(n, c) decompose into short roots of bn

2 (ui  uj) = ei  ej + vi  vj,
2 (u+i  u+j) = ei  ej + vi  vj,
2 (ui  u+j) = ei + ej + vi  vj,
2 (u+i  uj) = ei  ej + vi  vj,

i 6= j
i 6= j
i 6= j
i 6= j

and long roots of bn

2 (ui  u+i = 2ei
2 (u+i  ui) = 2ei.

recall that the constants cij are given in this case by

cij = (cid:26) m2,

m1,

if i  j 6= 0,n
if i  j = n

(6.82)

(6.83)

(6.84)
(6.85)

(6.86)

(6.87)
(6.88)

(6.89)

then the condition (6.26) in the requirements for lax pairs is satised, since each short
root of bn has two roots of gl(n, c) as preimages, and they come with opposite values
of vi  vj. each long root of bn has no v-dependence at all, and thus does not enter

84

(6.26). the condition (6.25) in the requirements for lax pairs is an easy consequence of
the functional equations (11.32) and (11.30) for the (x, z) and (x, z) functions. thus
our main task is to nd coecients di so that the last condition (6.27) for the lax pair be
satised.

we set  = 0. using the antisymmetry of the right hand side of (6.27) under x  x
and i  j on the left hand side, we see that d(x) = d(x). using this symmetry, we may
restrict attention to the cases i < j. two cases arise, j = n + i and j  i 6= 0, n, which
we discuss separately. consider rst the case j = n + i, in which (6.27) reduces to

mi(2xi) d  2ei = xk6=i,n+i

2{(ik  x)(k(n+i)  x)  (ik  x)(k(n+i)  x)}

n

(6.90)

= m2

2(2xi)

+(i(n+k)  x)  ((n+k)(n+i)  x)}

(6.91)

the right hand side is easily seen to vanish, which simply requires that d  ei = 0. next,
we consider the case j  i 6= 0, n, for which (6.27) becomes

m2(ij  x) s d  (ui  uj)

2{(ik  x)(kj  x)  (ik  x)(kj  x)}

m1m2{(ik  x)(kj  x)  (ik  x)(kj  x)}

1{(ik  x)(kj  x)  (ik  x)(kj  x)}
m2

(6.92)

the last sum in the preceding equation vanishes identically, because the conditions ik =
n and k  j = n imply that i  j = 0,2n, which is impossible since i 6= j. by
noticing that if i  k = n, we have that i = k for all i and k, we can easily make
the second and third sum collapse to single terms. thus we obtain

2{(ik  x)(kj  x)  (ik  x)(kj  x)}
m2

m2(ij  x) s d  (ui  uj)
= xik6=0,n
+m1m2{(2i  x)((i + j )  x)  (2i  x)((i + k)  x)}
+m1m2{((i + j )  x)(2j  x)  ((i + j )  x)(2j  x)}

kj 6=0,n

(6.93)

we now make use of the relations (11.32) and (11.33) for the functions  and  to simplify
the right hand side of (6.93). omitting an overall factor of m2(ij  x), (6.93) is reduced

85

to

s d  (ui  uj) = xik6=0,n

kj 6=0,n

this is solved by setting

6.5 scaling limits of lax pairs

all the lax pairs we constructed have nite scaling limits. this follows from the asymptotic
behavior of the function (u, z)

(u, z)  ( +e 1
e

2 u(1  z1eu2), re(u)  +
2 u(1  zeu2),
re(u)

(6.96)

in the range |re u| < 22. this asymptotic behavior results in nite limits for the expres-
sion cijij (  x) under the scalings dened in 5.7 for the hamiltonians. the behavior
of the functions cijij ( x) is similar, and thus both operators l(z) and m(z) have well
dened and nite limits.

more precisely, consider rst the scaling limits of the untwisted calogero-moser systems
dened with  = 1/hg, where hg is the coxeter number. this means that we let x =
x + 22, ez = zq 1

2 as in theorem 1, and set

cij = ( m||e2cij , when ij =   r(g)

when ij / r(g)

0,

(6.97)

then the matrices l(z), m(z) converge as 2  + to matrices l(z), m(z) of the form
(5.16), where the root system is the one associated with the ane algebra g(1), and the
generators e are given by
(6.98)

cij eij .

e = xij =

the matrices l(z), m(z) form a lax pair for the toda system associated with the ane
algebra g(1).

similarly, consider now the scaling limits of the twisted calogero-moser systems dened
g is the dual coxeter number. this means that we let x =

g, where h

with  = 1/h
x + 22, ez = zq 1

2 as in theorem, and set

cij = ( m||e2cij, when ij =   r(g)

when ij / r(g)
86

(6.99)

then the matrices l(z), m(z) of the lax pair for the twisted calogero-moser systems bn,
cn, and f4 all have nite limits. the entries of their limits are given as follows. for bn
and f4, the entries of the limit of l(z) and m(z) are given respectively by

in each case, the resulting matrices l(z), m(z) form a lax pair for the toda system
associated with (g(1)). in other words, starting with the lax pair for the twisted calogero-
moser system for bn, cn, and f4, we obtain respectively a lax pair for the toda system

we note that recently lax pairs of root type have been considered [61] which corre-
spond, in the above ansatz (5.3-5), to  equal to the adjoint representation of g and
the coecients cij vanishing for i or j associated with zero weights. this choice yields
another lax pair for the case of e8. however, as the authors have themselves pointed out
[62], the lax pairs they obtained do not tend to nite limits under the scalings dened in
theorems 1 and 2. thus the corresponding spectral curves do not appear to be suitable
as seiberg-witten curves for supersymmetric yang-mills theories.

87

7 super-yang-mills and calogero-moser systems

in this section, we begin by discussing the general correspondence between integrable
systems and n = 2 super yang-mills theory and then treat the correspondence in detail
for su(n) gauge group and a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of the gauge
group. why the eective prepotential of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories can be
realized by a bration of spectral curves remains one of the most important unanswered
questions in seiberg-witten theory. however, assuming this fact, it is easy to see, as
donagi and witten pointed out, the emergence of integrable models.

7.1 correspondence seiberg-witten and integrable systems

the key ingredient is the symplectic form  on the bration of jacobians (or prym vari-
eties) associated to the spectral curves 

 = (cid:18) n
xi=1

d(zi)(cid:19)

(7.1)

here we have identied the jacobian (or prym) of  with the symmetric product of r
copies of , and the dierential  in (7.1) is taken with respect to both the zi variables and
the vacuum parameters ui for the base of the bration. evidently,  is then of the form
 = jiduj  dzi, with no components of the form dui  duj or dzi  dzj. it follows that
the poisson brackets {uk, ul} all vanish. thus the vacuum moduli parameters of the gauge
theory can be viewed as a maximal pairwise commuting set of hamiltonians with respect
to the symplectic form . this correspondence between n = 2 supersymmetric gauge
theories and integrable models is quite attractive in its generality. however, it should
be stressed that it is probably incomplete.
indeed, in all known cases, one particular
hamiltonian amongst the innite set of hamiltonians seems to play a special role, namely
as a beta function for the gauge theory. also, there is at this moment no systematic rule
for how to identify the integrable model corresponding to a given gauge theory.

schematically, the aspects of the correspondence between the data that arise in both

settings can be summarized as follows in table 8.

in the table,  stands for the complex yang-mills coupling, r and m stand for the
hypermultiplet representation and mass respectively. the exact integrable system that
arises in the correspondence will depend upon the gauge algebra g and the representation
r of the hypermultiplet. its systematic identication is one of the major problems of the
study of supersymmetric yang-mills theories.

one of the rst cases obtained in all generality is when the gauge algebra is simple
and no hypermultiplets are present [44]. we have established previously that the seiberg-
witten curve for n = 2 super-yang-mills for su(n) gauge group and no hypermultiplets,

arrived at by arguments of singularity analysis, r-symmetry properties and limiting be-
havior, is precisely of the same form as the spectral curve for the period toda system
associated with the lie algebra an1 = su(n). the correct generalization of this corre-
spondence involves the periodic toda system associated with the twisted ane lie algebra
(g(1)). the appearance of the dual ane algebra (g(1)) is due to the grading of the term
z + 
z in the spectral curve det(ki  l(z)) = 0. when l(z), m(z) is the lax pair for the
g(1) toda system, this term will appear with the grading hg, if k and the casimirs ul of g
are given gradings 1 and l respectively. identifying ul with the vacuum moduli ul of the
gauge theory, we nd that the instanton generated term z + 
z should have instead grading
g, where h
h
g is the dual coxeter number. this is why the correct integrable system for
pure super-yang-mills theory with gauge algebra g should be the periodic toda system
associated with (g(1)). for the classical lie algebras g, the spectral curves derived from
the (g(1)) toda system were found to be in precise agreement with the preceding con-
structions in terms of the singularity structure of the seiberg-witten curves, r-symmetry
properties and the matching of various decoupling limits.

thus the case of pure yang-mills theories, with simple gauge algebra g and no ad-
ditional hypermultiplets, has been settled. the main problem we wish to address is the
identication of the integrable models corresponding to n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills
either with product gauge algebras, or with additional matter hypermultiplets. among
these, one theory is particularly attractive and has a certain universal aspect, in the sense
that many other theories follow from it in suitable decoupling limits. this is the yang-
mills theory with simple gauge algebra g, and one matter hypermultiplet in the adjoint
representation of g.

the rst case to be treated successfully was g = su(n), where the integrable model
was identied by donagi and witten [64] as the su(n) hitchin system [80]. several au-
thors [65] subsequently recognized the spectral curves of the su(n) hitchin system as
identical to the spectral curves of the su(n) elliptic calogero-moser system. this corre-

spondence between su(n) seiberg-witten theory and su(n) calogero-moser system was
however still rather rudimentary, since the vacuum parameters of the yang-mills theory
were still obscure, and the prepotential arising from the calogero-moser system were not
yet known to satisfy the monodromy properties required by eld theory. our purpose in
this section is to address these issues in the case of g = su(n), and to show that for gen-
eral g, the integrable model corresponding to the yang-mills theory with a hypermultiplet
in the adjoint representation is the twisted calogero-moser system associated to the lie
algebra g.

7.2 calogero-moser and seiberg-witten theory for su (n )
the full correspondence between seiberg-witten theory for n = 2 su(n) super-yang-
mills theory with one hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation of the gauge algebra,
and the elliptic su(n) calogero-moser systems was obtained in [66]. we describe it here
in some detail.

all that we shall need here of the elliptic calogero-moser system is its lax operator

l(z), whose n  n matrix elements are given by

lij(z) = piij  m(1  ij)(xi  xj, z)

(7.2)

notice that the hamiltonian is simply given in terms of l by h(x, p) = 1
with c =  1

2 m2n(n  1).

2trl(z)2 + c(z)

the correspondence between the data of the elliptic calogero-moser system and those

of the seiberg-witten theory is as follows.

 the parameter m in (7.2) is the hypermultiplet mass;
 the gauge coupling g and the -angle are related to the modulus of the torus (or

elliptic curve)  = c/(21z + 22z) by

 =

g2 ;

(7.3)

 the seiberg-witten curve  is the spectral curve of the elliptic calogero-moser

model, dened by

 = {(k, z)  c  , det(ki  l(z)) = 0}

(7.4)

and the seiberg-witten 1-form is d = k dz.  is invariant under the weyl group
of su(n). it can be viewed as n copies of the torus , glued along suitable cuts
on each copy. we use here the notation k in the equation for the spectral curve, in
order to reserve the notation k for a more convenient variable to be introduced later.

90

 using the lax equation l = [l, m], it is clear that the spectral curve is independent
of time, and can be dependent only upon the constants of motion of the calogero-
moser system, of which there are only n. these integrals of motion may be viewed
as parametrized by the quantum moduli of the seiberg-witten system.

 finally, d = kdz is meromorphic, with a simple pole on each of the n sheets above
the point z = 0 on the base torus. the residue at each of these poles is proportional
to m, as required by the general set-up of seiberg-witten theory, explained in 2.

7.3 four fundamental theorems

while the above mappings of the seiberg-witten data onto the calogero-moser data are
certainly natural, there is no direct proof for them, and it is important to check that the
results inferred from it agree with known facts from quantum eld theory. to establish this,
as well as a series of further predictions from the correspondence, we give four theorems
(the proofs may be found in [66] for the rst three theorems, and in [67] for the last one).
theorem 4. the spectral curve equation det(ki  l(z)) = 0 can be expressed as

(7.8)

(7.9)

where we have set 1 = i without loss of generality. the series expansion (7.9) is
superconvergent and sparse in the sense that it receives contributions only at integers that
grow like n2. but more important, it provides a geometric interpretation of the order
parameters of the super yang-mills theory: at q = 0, the base torus  degenerates into a
sphere with two punctures at w = 0 and w = , if we introduce the new variable

w = ez

(7.10)

each of the copies of the torus  making up the spectral curve  upstairs degenerates
correspondingly into a sphere with two punctures. now the equation (7.9) of the spectral
curve  at q = 0 becomes

h(k)  wh(k  m) = 0

(7.11)

thus the punctures lying above w = 0 are given by the n zeroes ki of the polynomial
h(k), while those lying above w =  are given by ki  m. now the a-cycles on  can
be chosen to be circles of a xed radius around each of the points ki. at the degeneration
point q = 0, the seiberg-witten dierential d = kdz can be written as

d = k d ln w = kd ln

(7.12)

the second terms on the right does not contribute to a-periods, while the other two terms
readily give

as asserted in theorem 4. this relation provides the key starting point of the correspon-
dence between calogero-moser systems and supersymmetric gauge theories, by identifying
the classical vacua parameters in terms of the moduli of the calogero-moser spectral
curves.

the parametrization of spectral curves by polynomials h(k) has been extended from
su(n) calogero-moser systems to su(n) spin calogero-moser systems in [73], using
methods of quantum eld theory on riemann surfaces [68]. for su(n) calogero-moser
systems, a dierent derivation from [66] has been recently obtained in [69].

the expansion (7.9) actually allows us to determine the exact value of the quantum
vacua parameters ai as power series in q. geometrically, for q 6= 0, each copy of the torus
making up  has a branch cut of length o(|q|1/2) which shrinks to the puncture ki as
q  0. but the contours ai can still be chosen at a xed, nonvanishing distance from
ki. thus the ai-periods of d can be evaluated by residue formulas, just as in the case
of the fundamental representation. more specically, applying the methods in [26] for the
perturbative solution of xed point equations, we nd

we would like to stress that the expansion (7.15) is a reliable expansion only when the
denominators of the expressions n (k) and n (k  m) are bounded away from 0. as
explained earlier, this can be achieved in the evaluation of the a-periods, by xing the
a-cycles away from the points ki. we can deduce then the full expansion in q of the
seiberg-witten dierential d = kd ln w. each term in the expansion is rational in k with
poles at ki and ki m, and the corresponding residues are easily evaluated. for example,
we obtain to order q2

ai = ki + q si(ki) +

q2( si)

for the super yang-mills theory with matter in the adjoint representation, the microscopic
gauge coupling q = e2i is analogous to the renormalization scale  encountered earlier
for the fundamental representation, and the full expansion in q of the vacua parameters ai
is required to evaluate the contributions to the prepotential f of instanton processes to
an arbitrary order.

theorem 5. the prepotential of the seiberg-witten theory obeys a renormalization group-
type equation that simply relates f to the calogero-moser hamiltonian, expressed in terms
of the quantum order parameters aj

furthermore, in an expansion in powers of the instanton factor q = e2i , the quantum
order parameters aj may be computed by residue methods in terms of the zeros of h(k).
(the polynomial h(k) is not to be confused with the calogero-moser hamiltonian h(x, p);
the notation is conventional.)

the microscopic gauge coupling  corresponds geometrically to the moduli of the base
torus , so that the renormalization group equation (7.17) is mathematically a statement
about deformations of complex structures. the main underlying equation is the following

adi =

xj=1iaj

93

(7.18)

where i, 1  i  n, is the basis of holomorphic abelian integrals dual to the ai basis
of cycles. it can be derived by showing that the deformation d of the seiberg-witten
dierential satises a -equation, and solving this equation in terms of the prime form
[66]. now the abelian dierentials i can also be written as

and f (n) are the terms due to instanton processes. the renormalization group equation
(7.17) shows that all the coecients f (n) can just be read o from an expansion of the
hamiltonian h(x, p) in terms of the vacua parameters ai. such an expansion is easily
obtained by writing h(x, p) in terms of the calogero-moser integrals of motion ki, and
inverting the relations (7.16) giving ai in terms of ki. for example, to two-instanton order,
the results can be described as in part (b) of the following theorem [66]:

theorem 6. (a) the perturbative part f (pert) of the prepotential given by the calogero-
moser spectral curves is indeed of the form (7.22);

part (a) of theorem 6 cannot be obtained from the renormalization group equation.
we discuss briey its proof, which is important, because it is the dening criterion for
the calogero-moser spectral curves to provide an exact solution of the four-dimensional
supersymmetric gauge theory. the main problem in establishing (a) is to determine the
leading terms in the periods adi of the seiberg-witten dierential d. recall that as q
moves away from 0, each puncture ki and ki + m on each sheet above the base torus 
opens into a cut. let ki be the end points of the cut near ki. they can be identied as
the solutions of the equation

this equation can be solved perturbatively in q. to o(q) order, we nd

similarly, the end points of the cut near ki + m can be identied as ki + m.

the b-cycles for the spectral curve  can be chosen as paths from k+

(7.27)

the most dicult step in the evaluation of (7.27) is how to express the dierential d ln w
in terms of dk. for the periods ai, this step was easy, because the a-cycles could be kept
at xed distance from ki. here, the b-cycles end at k+
i , which is at distance q1/2  0
from ki, in view of (7.26). thus the expansion (7.15) for w does not apply in the present
case. however, it turns out that an approximation for w as a function of k can be found
to order o(q). it is given by

w =

h(k)

h(k  m) 

1 (k)

1 +q1  4q+

(7.28)

1 (k) and 1 (k  m) are dened in (7.15). expanding in q, the
where the functions +
dierential d can now be expressed in terms of rational functions of k. the same analytic
continuation methods used in the case of the fundamental representation apply, giving
the leading terms of adi. the perturbative part f (pert) can be read o from adi = fai
,
establishing (a).

the perturbative corrections to the prepotential are of course predicted by asymptotic
freedom. the formulas in (b) for the instanton corrections f (1) and f (2) are new, as they
have not yet been computed by direct eld theory methods. perturbative expansions of
the prepotential in powers of m have also been obtained in [70].

95

the moduli ki, 1  i  n, of the gauge theory are evidently integrals of motion of the
system. to identify these integrals of motion, denote by s be any subset of {1,   , n},
and let s = {1,   , n} \ s, (s) = (xi  xj) when s = {i, j}. let also ps denote the
subset of momenta pi with i  s. we have [67]
theorem 7. for any k, 0  k  n, let k(k1,   , kn ) = k(k) be the k-th symmetric
polynomial of (k1,   , kn ), dened by h(u) = pn

the proof of theorem 7 requires some new elliptic function identities, linking combina-
tions of the function (x, z) with determinants of the -operator on the torus [68]. these
identities indicate a close relationship between elliptic calogero-moser systems and free
fermions.

7.4 partial decoupling of hypermultiplet, product groups

the spectral curves of certain gauge theories can be easily derived from the calogero-moser
curves by a partial decoupling of the hypermultiplet. indeed,

 the masses of the gauge multiplet and hypermultiplet are |ai  aj| and |ai  aj + m|.
in suitable limits, some of these masses become , and states with innite mass
decouple. the remaining gauge group is a subgroup of su(n).

 when the eective coupling of a gauge subgroup is 0, the dynamics freeze and the

gauge states become non-interacting.

non-trivial decoupling limits arise when    and m  . when all ai are nite, we
obtain the pure yang-mills theory. when some hypermultiplets masses remain nite, the
u(1) factors freeze, the gauge group su(n) is broken down to su(n1)  su(np), and
the remaining hypermultiplets are in e.g. fundamental or bifundamental representations.
for example, let n = 2n1 be even, and set

ki = v1 + xi, kn1+j = v2 + yj, 1  i, j  n1,

(7.30)

i=1 xi = pn1

with pn1
j=1 yj = 0. (the term v = v1  v2 is associated to the u(1) factor of the
gauge group). in the limit m  , q  0, with xi, yj,  = v  m and  = mq
n kept
xed, the theory reduces to a su(n1)  su(n1) gauge theory, with a hypermultiplet in
the bifundamental (n1, n1)  ( n1, n1), and spectral curve

where a(x) = qn1

j=1(x +   yj), t = ez. this agrees with the curve

engineering.

these formulas can serve as useful checks on candidates for seiberg-witten curves for

theories with product gauge groups obtained by other methods [71, 29].

8 calogero-moser and seiberg-witten for general g

we consider now the n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory for a general simple gauge
algebra g and a hypermultiplet of mass m in the adjoint representation.

8.1 the general case

then, we have the following results, established in [74]

 the seiberg-witten curve of the theory is given by the spectral curve  = {(k, z) 
c ; det(ki  l(z)) = 0} of the twisted elliptic calogero-moser system associated to the
lie algebra g. the seiberg-witten dierential d is given by d = kdz.

 the function r(k, z) = det(ki  l(z)) is polynomial in k and meromorphic in z. the
spectral curve  is invariant under the weyl group of g. it depends on n complex moduli,
which can be thought of as independent integrals of motion of the calogero-moser system.
 the dierential d = kdz is meromorphic on , with simple poles. the position
and residues of the poles are independent of the moduli. the residues are linear in the
hypermultiplet mass m.
(unlike the case of su(n), their exact values are dicult to
determine for general g).

 in the m  0 limit, the calogero-moser system reduces to a free system, the spectral
curve  is just the producr of several unglued copies of the base torus , indexed by the
constant eigenvalues of l(z) = p  h. let ki, 1  i  n, be n independent eigenvalues, and
ai, bi be the a and b cycles lifted to the corresponding sheets. for each i, we readily
obtain

ai =

(8.1)

thus the prepotential f is given by f = 
i . this is the classical prepotential
and hence the correct answer, since in the m  0 limit, the theory acquires an n = 4
supersymmetry, and receives no quantum corrections.

 the m   limit is the crucial consistency check, which motivated the introduction
of the twisted calogero-moser systems in the rst place [59, 60]. in view of theorem 2 and
subsequent comments, in the limit m  , q  0, with

x = x + 22

m = mq 1

g

98

(8.2)

with x and m kept xed, the hamiltonian and spectral curve for the twisted elliptic
calogero-moser system with lie algebra g reduce to the hamiltonian and spectral curve
for the toda system for the ane lie algebra (g(1)). this is the correct answer. indeed,
in this limit, the gauge theory with adjoint hypermultiplet reduces to the pure yang-mills
theory, and the seiberg-witten spectral curves for pure yang-mills with gauge algebra
g have been shown by martinec and warner [44] to be the spectral curves of the toda
system for (g(1)).

 as in the known correspondences between seiberg-witten theory and integrable

models [66], we expect the following equation

f


= h twisted

g

(x, p),

(8.3)

to hold. note that the left hand side can be interpreted in the gauge theory as a renor-
malization group equation.

 for simple laced g, the curves r(k, z) = 0 are modular invariant. physically, the
gauge theories for these lie algebras are self-dual. for non simply-laced g, the modular
group is broken to the congruence subgroup 0(2) for g = bn, cn, f4, and to 0(3) for
g2. the hamiltonians of the twisted calogero-moser systems for non-simply laced g
are also transformed under landen transformations into the hamiltonians of the twisted
calogero-moser system for the dual algebra g.
it would be interesting to determine
whether such transformations exist for the spectral curves or the corresponding gauge
theories themselves.

spectral curves for certain gauge theories with classical gauge algebras and matter in
the adjoint representation have also been proposed in [71] and [72], based on branes and
m-theory. some generalizations of the construction by witten [71] for su(n) were given
in [75], [76] and [77]. relations between the dynamics of gauge theories from branes and
integrable systems were proposed and analyzed in [78]. a possible role in seiberg-witten
theory for ruijsenaars-schneider and related relativistic systems has been investigated in
[79].

8.2 spectral curves for low rank

in the case of g = dn, the trigonometric limit (q  0) of the spectral curve r(k, z) = 0
can be written down explicitly and takes a particularly simple form (see (8.16) below).
now the equation r(k, z) = 0 for the spectral curve is polynomial in pj, , g2, g3, and
, where g2, g3 are the usual eisenstein series of weights 4 and 6, and  = g3
2  27g2
in the limit q  0, only  vanishes. since the weight of  is 12
is the discriminant.
and the degree of the spectral curves is 2n, the spectral curves are determined by their
trigonometric limit when n  5.

the derivation of the trigonometric limit is as follows. let z be the spectral parameter

dened by

now the spectral curve  depends on the dynamical variables pi, xi, but only through n
combinations ui = ui(m). at m = 0, ui(m) are just the n independent casimirs of g,
which are polynomials in p of degrees i + 1. as m is deformed away from 0, the ui(m)
are still recognizable by their leading p behavior. thus we may carry out our calculations
with any choice of the variables xi. a particularly convenient choice is

since  + i = uut with ut = (1,   , 1), and det(m + uut ) = det m(1 + ut m1u) for any

the similarity with the equation (7.5) for the su(n) calogero-moser spectral curves is
now manifest. just as in the case of su(n), the parameters pj can be identied with the
classical vacuum parameters of the gauge theory.

we derive now explicit formulas for r(k, z) for n  5. let

8.3 perturbative prepotential for so(2n)

with the parametrization (8.16) in terms of the polynomial h(a), it is now easy to evaluate
the logarithmic terms of the prepotential f . we have already shifted the variable k to
the variable a dened by (8.12). a complete shift of the variables (k, z) to new variables
(a, u) is obtained by setting

the equation () of the curve becomes

eu =

k2  (a + m)2

k2  a2

eu =

h(a + m)

h(a)

.

(8.34)

(8.35)

it remains to determine the seiberg-witten dierential d = kdz in terms of a and u.
evidently, k can be solved in terms of a and u using (8.34). to write z in terms of a and
u, we note that z can be expressed in terms of z by (8.4), which can be solved in terms
of a and k using (8.12). the nal outcome is

ez =

2
z + 1
2
z  1

(k  a)(k + a + m)
(k + a)(k  a  m)
d = adu  md ln(k2  (a + m)2)

=

(8.36)

(8.37)

this is now essentially the same set-up as the spectral curves and seiberg-witten dif-
ferential for the su(n) calogero-moser system. the same methods used earlier give
immediately the logarithmic terms in the prepotential

f 1loop = 

1

8i xr(dr )

(  a)2 ln(  a)2  (  a + m)2 ln(  a + m)2

(8.38)

these are the logarithmic singularities expected from eld theory considerations.

10 appendix b : lie algebra theory

in figure 1, we give the dynkin diagrams for the nite dimensional simple lie algebras;
for the untwisted ane lie algebras (left column) and for the twisted ane lie algebras
(right column). the simple roots are labeled following dynkin notation, and are given in
an orthonormal basis in table 9, where we also list the dimension, the coxeter and dual
coxeter numbers (to be dened below). we list the set of all roots in table 9, and of the
highest roots in table 10. below we provide additional notations and denitions [63].

let g be one of the nite dimensional simple lie algebras of rank n, let i, and
i , i = 1,   , n be its simple roots and coroots respectively. the coroot  of
i  2i/2
any root is dened by  = 2/2. any (co-)root admits a unique decomposition into a
sum of simple (co-)roots, with integer coecients li and li .

 =

n

xi=1

 =

li i .

(10.1)

the coecients li and li are either all positive or all negative according to whether  (or
) is positive or negative respectively. they are related by

i = 1,   , n.

(10.2)

the highest root 0 and co-root 0 play special roles. the extension of the simple root
system of an algebra g by 0 generates the untwisted ane lie algebra g(1), while the
extension of the simple coroot system of g by 0 generates the dual ane lie algebra
(g(1)). when g is non-simply laced, (g(1)) coincides with one of the twisted ane lie
algebras. the dynkin diagrams of these various lie algebras are given in table 1. the

in this appendix we review some basic denitions and properties of elliptic functions on an
elliptic curve of periods 21 and 22 and modulus  = 2/1, im > 0. the half periods
are 1, 2 and 3 = 1 + 2. for a useful source, see [81].

11.2 half and third period functions

elliptic functions at half and third period (which are the only ones that we shall need here,
since the order of twisting is at most 3) are expressible in terms of the original periods
using landens transformations [81].
it is convenient to make a denite choice for the
period that is to be twisted; we shall choose this period to be 1. it is straightforward to
adapt these formulas when an arbitrary period 2a, a = 1,   , 3 is twisted.
formulas for twists of order 2 : elliptic functions with half periods

henceforth, we shall reserve the notation (z), (z) and (z) for the corresponding
weierstrass functions with periods 21 and 22, as dened in b (a). the elliptic functions
at half period 1 are given by

2(z) = (z; 1, 22) = (z) + (z + 1)  (1)

=

1

(1)

[(z)(z + 1)  ((1)  (2))((1)  (3))]

2(z) = (z; 1, 22) = (z) + (z + 1) + z(1)  1
2(z) = (z; 1, 22) =

(z)(z + 1)

2 z2(1)z1

e

(1)

(11.20)

this gives rise to the duplication formula

4(2z) = (z) + (z + 1) + (z + 2) + (z + 1 + 2).

(11.21)

formulas for twists of order 3 : elliptic functions at third periods

similarly, we have the following formulas for the third period elliptic functions

3(z) = (z; 21/3, 22) = (z) + (z + 21/3) + (z + 41/3)

3(z) = (z; 21/3, 22) = (z) + (z + 21/3) + (z + 41/3)

(21/3)  (41/3)

3(z) = (z; 21/3, 22) =

+z(21/3) + z(41/3)  1
(z)(z + 21/3)(z + 41/3)

).

113

(11.23)

all of the above formulas may be established by identifying singularities in z and estab-
lishing that the remainder must be independent of z by liouvilles theorem.

the functions at half and third periods, dened above are related to one another in a

way analogous to (b.4)

(z; 21, 22) = 

d
dz

(z; 21, 22) = 

d2
dz2 log (z; 21, 22),

(11.24)

where  = 1, 2, 3.

11.3 the function 

we dene the function  by

(x, z) = (x, z; 21, 22) =

(z  x)
(z)(x)

ex(z),

(11.25)

where (z) and (z) are the weierstrass functions of (b.4) and (b.7). as a function of
z, (x, z) is periodic with periods 21 and 22, is holomorphic except for an essential
singularity at z = 0, and has a single zero at z = x. as a function of x, (x, z) has
multiplicative monodromy, given by

(x + 2a, z) = (x, z)e2a(z)2az,

(11.26)

is holomorphic in x except for a simple pole at x = 0, and has a single zero at x = z. some
useful asymptotics are given as follows
1
x(z) + o(x2)
2
+ (x) + o(z)}ex(z)

x

(x, z) = {

(x, z) =

(11.27)

products of the function (x, z), with pn

=1 x = 0, are periodic in z, with periods 21
and 22, and meromorphic in z since the essential singularities cancel. as a result, they
satisfy

(x, z) = pn[(z); x] + (z)qn[(z); x],

(11.28)

n

y=1

where pn and qn are polynomials of degrees [ n
dependent coecients. the simplest case is

2 ] and [ n3

2 ] in (z) respectively, with x-

(x, z)(x, z) = (z)  (x)

(11.29)

in general, the polynomials p and q may be determined by the fact that the r.h.s. of
(b.19) has a simple zero at each point z = x, and that the pole highest order in z has
coecient (1)n.

the function (x, z) satises a fundamental dierential equation,

(x, z)(y, z)  (y, z)(x, z) = ((x)  (y))(x + y, z),

where (x, z) denotes the derivative with respect to x of (x, z).

(11.30)

114

11.4 the functions , 1, 2

the functions  and 2 are dened by

(2x, z) = 2(x, z) =

(x, z)(x + 1, z)

(1, z)

.

(11.31)

the essential singularity in z and the monodromy in x of (2x, z) coincide with those of
(x, z). we shall need the following two basic dierential equations,

(2x, z)(2y, z)  (2x, z)(2y, z) =
2(x, z)2(y, z)  2(y, z)2(x, z) = (2(x)  2(y))2(x + y, z),

(2(x)  2(y))(2x + 2y, z),

1
2

(11.32)

as well as dierential equation that involves both  and ,

(2x, z)(x  y, z)  (2x, z)(x  y, z)
(2y, z)(x + y, z) + (2y, z)(x + y, z) =
(2(x)  2(y))(x  y, z).(11.33)
by letting y  x in (b.23), and taking into account the known zeros of , we derive
another useful formula

1
2

(2x, z)(2x, z) = 2(z)  2(x).

(11.34)

actually, 2(x, z) may be viewed as the function (x, z) associated with a torus of periods
1 and 22.

the function 1(x, z) is dened by

1(x, z) = (x, z) + f (z)(x + 1, z)

f (z) = ei(z)+1z.

(11.35)
(11.36)

it obeys the monodromy relation 1(x + 1, z) = f (z)11(x, z), as well as the following
dierential equations

1(x, z)1(y, z)  1(x, z)1(y, z) = (2(x)  2(y))1(x + y, z)
1(x, z)(y, z)  (y, z)1(x, z) = {(x + 1)  (y)}1(x + y, z)
