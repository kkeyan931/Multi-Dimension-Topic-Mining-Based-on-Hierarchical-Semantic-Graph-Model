we show that all spatial gluon connected correlation func-
tions in su(n) or so(n) qcd vanish at nite temperature
and zero momentum in lattice landau or coulomb gauges,
due to the proximity of the gribov horizon. these observa-
tions also apply to qcd with two colors and an even number
of avors at large chemical potential. these nonperturbative
results may have consequences on the nature of the thermal
magnetic mass and the character of the magnetic color super-
conductivity.

1. at high temperature or density, the physics of color
charge screening and oscillation in qcd is closely related
to the behaviour of the gauge-xed gluonic correlation
functions [1]. finite temperature qcd perturbation the-
ory has proven to be useful but limited to leading orders
due to the persistence of infrared singularities [2]. fi-
nite density qcd perturbation theory is believed to be
infrared tamed due to landau-damping [3].

lattice yang-mills simulations of the spatial wilson
loops show an area law above the critical temperature [4],
an indication that magnetic gluons suer little change
across the deconning temperature. the electric gluons
appear to be screened as is evident in the behaviour of
the polyakov loop correlation functions across the critical
temperature [5].

in this note we show that a lattice regularized version
of qcd at nite temperature, yields zero for the con-
nected magnetic correlation functions in the innite vol-
ume limit, both in landau and coulomb gauges, extend-
ing an early observation by zwanziger [6] at zero tem-
perature. this result applies to both su(n) and so(n)
gauge groups irrespective of the center zn .
in short,
in landau and coulomb gauges, the proximity of the
gribov horizon [7] in the infrared directions puts strong
bounds on the mean color magnetization [8]. fortunately,
no such bounds can be made for the connected electric
correlation functions, which are expected to enjoy per-
turbative screening.

in general, our arguments do not extend to qcd with
nite chemical potential, as the measure on the gauge-
xed congurations is no longer positive. an exception
is qcd with two colors and an even number of avors for
which positivity is recovered. in this case, both the elec-
tric and magnetic gluon connected correlation functions
vanish at zero momentum in landau gauge, an indication
that nonperturbative physics permeates the problem at

even large chemical potential.

2. our arguments will follow closely those given by
zwanziger [6], and we refer the reader to them for more
details. in short, in the minimal landau and coulomb
gauges the elds are selected by the two conditions [6]:

k(a)  0
where a is the classical lattice connection

 a = 0

which is lie group valued.  is the lattice divergence.
the u s are su(n) valued link variables from x to x + e
on a d-dimensional asymmetric lattice v =   ld1
with periodic boundary conditions.
in landau gauge, we may follow [6] and use the posi-
tivity of the faddeev-popov kernel k to bound the zero
frequency component of the lattice gluon eld a. using
plane-waves, the bounds are [9]

for actually any su(n) gauge group. the present bounds
hold for so(n) as well. while the mean of the spatial
color magnetization vanishes as l  , its temporal
analogue does not at nite temperature since  = 1/t is
kept xed.

bounds on the free energy follow from the partition

where a is selected by the conditions (1), (a) is the

qcd measure [10], and h a = (h a
ored magnetic eld. at nite  the measure is positive,
a requirement for the following bounds to hold. the free
energy w(h4, ~h) = lnz(h)/v depends separatly on h a
and ~h a. a rerun of the arguments in [6] shows that

as l  , the second inequality implies w(0, ~h) = 0.
the rst inequality remains unaected. the system re-
4 but not to a constant ~h a. it
sponds to a constant h a
follows that all spatial gluon connected correlation func-
tions vanish at zero three-momentum in lattice coulomb
gauge, and zero four-momentum in lattice landau gauge.
in the latter case, the limit is understood in the screening
sequence as   0 then |~k|  0, with k = (, ~k). it is im-
portant that the temporal gluon correlation functions are
not bounded. indeed, screening of colored gluons with a
nite electric mass takes place in the high temperature
phase [5].

the vanishing of the zero-momentum spatial gluon
propagator in landau gauge, takes the following form
in the innite volume limit

dii(0) = lim
|k|0

lim

0z ddx eikxhai(x) ai(0)i = 0

in the unrenormalized case. for d < 4, the renormaliza-
tion constants are nite and (6) holds in the continuum
limit. for d = 4, the diverging character of the renormal-
ization constants prevent us from making similar state-
ments for the renormalized propagator in the continuum
limit. for |~k|  0, (6) suggests a continuum behaviour
analogous to |~k|2/(|~k|4 + m4
m ), that is screening masses
that are moved to innity at zero momentum, in line
with gribovs suggestion in the vacuum [7]. given the
infrared problem noted in qcd perturbation theory [2],
we expect mm  g2t .
recently, lattice simulations of the gluon propagator
in landau gauge have been carried out on a symmet-
ric lattice in three-dimensions [12], and on an asymmet-
ric lattice in four-dimensions [11]. the results in three-
dimensions and for small momenta are in agreement with
the original suggestion by zwanziger [6], and consistent
with our results. the t to the lattice data in [11] was
forced to emm z, while the analogue of the gribov prop-
agator at nite temperature suggests a t to

dii(z, z)  emm z/2 cos(cid:18) mm z

this may explain the z-dependence observed in the read-
ing of the magnetic mass in [11]. the pre-exponent in
(7) indicates a change in sign in the propagator at large
distance. some subtleties related to the extrapolation
to small momenta on a nite lattice have been discussed
in [12].

3. the extension of the present observations to -
nite chemical potential runs into the diculty that the
fermion determinant is no longer real, making the mea-
sure (a) in (5) complex. however, the case nc = 2
and even nf is an exception. in general, for nc = 2 the
fermion determinant admits an extra symmetry under
charge conjugation (assuming that the continuum dirac
operator is recovered on a ne lattice). if  is an eigen-

value, so is  by chiral symmetry, and  by the invari-
ance under 2c1k where k is complex conjugation and
c is charge conjugation. not all eigenstates are four-fold
bunched. the purely real or purely imaginary eigenstates
are only two-fold bunched. hence the fermion determi-
nant is real. for even nf it is even positive.
in this
case, most of the arguments presented in [6] applies for
both the temporal and spatial correlations of the gluon
connected correlation functions at  = l (symmetric lat-
tice). the precedent arguments apply to the spatial cor-
relation functions for  6= l (asymmetric lattice).
in a recent argument [3] it was suggested that at large
chemical potential , color magnetic superconductivity
can be sustained by landau-damping. below the light
cone, the spatial gluon correlator follows from qcd per-
e/|~k|) with
turbation theory in the form 1/(k2  im2
me  g. the present arguments suggest that be-
low the light cone the propagator for the spatial gluons
may be analogous to the one suggested by gribov, e.g.
|~k|2/(|~k|4 + m4
), with permanent connement of mag-
netic gluons in the infrared. we expect m  me. for
nc = 2 and nf even perturbation theory fails below the
light cone at even large chemical potential. could this
aect the perturbative arguments for qcd with three
colors at large chemical potential [3]?

4. we have suggested that the proximity of the gri-
bov horizon at nite temperature, and also for a spe-
cial case of nite chemical potential, forces a vanishing
of the color magnetization in qcd in both landau and
coulomb gauges. on the lattice, this observation holds
for any su(n) or so(n) gauge group, making the issue
of the center zn not important for this problem. in the
continuum, this forces the spatial and connected gluon
correlations to vanish at zero three-momentum, suggest-
ing magnetic screening masses that become innite in the
infrared. these observations are relevant to the current
arguments related to the onset of a magnetic mass in
qcd at high temperature. they also suggest that qcd
perturbation theory in the magnetic sector may not ap-
ply even at large chemical potential.

[9] a bound can be derived for the nite momentum compo-
nents of the gauge-eld, from which the zero momentum
limit follows. at nite temperature, the arguments follow
closely those of appendix a in [6] (second reference).

[10] in lattice coulomb gauge, the measure includes an inte-
gration over the vertical link variables for a xed time
slice.
