using relationships between open and closed strings, we present a construction of tree-level scat-
tering amplitudes for gravitons minimally coupled to matter in terms of gauge theory partial am-
plitudes.
in particular, we present examples of amplitudes with gravitons coupled to vectors or
to a single fermion pair. we also present two examples with massive graviton exchange, as would
arise in the presence of large compact dimensions. the gauge charges are represented by avors
of dynamical scalars or fermions. this also leads to an unconventional decomposition of color and
kinematics in gauge theories.

although gravity and gauge theories both contain local
symmetries, their dynamical behavior are rather dier-
ent. nonetheless, there are some rather striking relation-
ships between the theories such as the ads/cft corre-
spondence [1] and the perturbative relationships implied
by the structure of closed string amplitudes in terms of
open string amplitudes [2]. in this letter we demonstrate
that at least for the case of a at background, there is
an elegant and powerful way to obtain the interaction of
gravitons with matter, based on the structure of heterotic
strings. our construction is valid for the cases of gravi-
tons coupled to vectors and to at most a single fermion
pair. the cases of pure einstein gravity and n = 8 su-
pergravity have already been discussed in refs. [3,4,5].
recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in per-
turbative gravity, especially in the presence of large com-
pact dimensions [6] and in ads spaces [1], making it all
the more timely to investigate the perturbative structure
of gravity theories.

the dierences between gravitational and gauge in-
teractions are well known. for example, quantum chro-
modynamics is renormalizable and exhibits connement.
neither property is shared by gravity. moreover, the
structure of the einstein-hilbert and yang-mills la-
grangians leh = 2
 f a are
rather dierent. in particular, gravity has an innite set
of contact interactions while non-abelian gauge theories
have only up to four-point contact interactions.

at tree level, kawai, lewellen and tye (klt) [2] have,
however, expressed closed string amplitudes as sums of
products of open string amplitudes. in the eld theory
limit this allows one to obtain gravity tree amplitudes di-
rectly from gauge theory ones. this is generally simpler
than using conventional gravity feynman rules. as dis-
cussed in ref. [7], by using non-linear eld redenitions
and gauge xings, the lagrangians of the two theories
can be rearranged to make the relations between the two
theories more apparent. (see also ref. [8].) with the an-

1

alytic reconstruction method described in refs. [9,4,5] the
loop amplitudes can be obtained from the tree ones. in
this way gravity can be perturbatively quantized with-
out reference to a lagrangian. this has already been ex-
ploited to demonstrate that d = 11 supergravity diverges
at two-loops in accordance with naive expectations [4,10]
and that d = 4 n = 8 supergravity likely has the rst di-
vergence at ve [4] instead of three loops [11], as expected
from superspace power counting. in order to perform a
more general investigation of the divergence structure of
gravity theories, it would be useful to have more general
tree amplitudes besides those of pure gravity or super-
gravity.

here we discuss amplitudes where gravitons are mini-
mally coupled to gauge theories. maximally helicity vio-
lating (mhv) n-point tree amplitudes for pure gravity [3]
and for gravitationally dressed parke-taylor [12] gluon
amplitudes have been presented in refs. [3,13]. using the
klt relations, we extend these results to the remain-
ing mhv gravitationally dressed gluon amplitudes and
to ones with a single fermion pair. our construction also
applies to cases of non-maximal helicity violation, but the
mhv cases are the simplest to present. we also present
four-point examples with a (massive) graviton exchange.
the klt equations [2,3] for eld theory gravity tree

amplitudes are,

m4(1, 2,3,4) = is12a4(1, 2, 3, 4) a4(1, 2, 4, 3) ,
m5(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) =

ihs12s34a5(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) a5(2, 1, 4, 3, 5)
+s13s24a5(1, 3, 2, 4, 5) a5(3, 1, 4, 2, 5)i ,

(1)

where sij = (ki + kj )2. the an and an are tree-level
color-ordered gauge theory partial amplitudes [14]. our
notation is to suppress polarizations, i, and momenta,
ki, leaving only the label i for each leg. explicit forms of
the klt equations for an arbitrary number of external

legs may be found in ref. [5]. we have dropped the cou-
plings, but for each gauge and gravitational interaction
appearing on the left-hand-side, factors of the couplings
g and /2 (where 2 = 32gn ) are respectively required.
although the use of the klt equations in the eld the-
ory limit does not require a fully consistent string theory,
some features of string theory are retained. for example,
an oriented string will necessarily contain antisymmetric
tensor and dilaton states in its massless spectrum. when
describing graviton exchanges, the klt equations will
therefore also implicitly contain these states. however,
for the cases dealt with in this letter, the antisymmetric
tensor and dilaton decouple, so that extra projections are
not required to remove these states, if unwanted.

in order to apply the klt equations to the cases of
gravity coupled to matter, we must specify the factoriza-
tion of each state into states appearing solely in gauge
theories. in doing so, we must ensure that the spin and
charges for each state are the desired ones. we factorize
each graviton into a product of vectors, each gluon into
either a product of a vector and a scalar or a product of
two fermions and each quark into a fermion and a scalar.
as motivated by the structure of the heterotic string, the
gauge charges of each physical state are assigned as a-
vor charges carried by scalars or by fermions. at the lin-
earized level these factorizations are trivial. in a sense,
we use the klt equations to extend them to the fully
interacting theories.

as a specic example, consider su (nc) gauge the-
ory minimally coupled to einstein gravity.
in g. 1
we present rules for constructing, via the klt equa-
tions, gluon amplitudes dressed by minimally coupled
gravitons; for this case, the rules give the partial am-
plitudes an and an appearing in the klt equations.
these rules are determined by requiring that the ampli-
tudes with gravitons carry the correct quantum numbers
and dimensions. as discussed below, cases with a single
fermion pair can be handled similarly. (the signature of
 is (+,,,).) these rules are similar to ordinary
gauge theory feynman rules except that they are color
ordered [14], i.e. the color group theory factors have been
stripped. in constructing the diagrams one should main-
tain a clockwise ordering of the legs. the group theory
factors appearing in the rule are associated with the a-
vors of dynamical scalars. after substituting the an and
an into the klt equations, on the left-hand-side the
group theory factors are reinterpreted as color factors.
we have displayed the vertices in the commonly used
feynman gauge and have chosen all group theory factors
to be in the adjoint representation. for other represen-
tations the group theory factors should be altered to the
appropriate one.

it is instructive to rst apply these rules to a pure
gluon amplitude. the klt equations will apply, since
such amplitudes are part of a theory coupling gravitons
to gluons. in this case, the construction is circular, since

tons. dashed lines represent scalars and curly ones vectors.

it starts with a gauge theory amplitude only to wind up
at the same amplitude. it will, however, easily generalize
to cases including gravitons.

with the standard color decomposition [14], the four-

gluon tree amplitude is expressed as,

m4(1a1

g , 2a2

g , 3a3

g , 4a4

tr[t a(1) t a(2) t a(3) t a(4) ]

g ) = g2x
a4((1g), (2g), (3g), (4g)) ,

(2)

where  runs over the set of non-cyclic permutations and
the a4 are color-ordered partial amplitudes. we denote
gluon, graviton, scalar and quark legs by the subscripts
g, h, s and q.
(our fundamental representation color
matrices are normalized by tr[t at b] = ab.)

by applying the klt formula (1) we express the four-

gluon amplitude with only gluon exchanges as
m4(1a1

g ) = ig2s12a4(1g, 2g, 3g, 4g)

where the diagrams for obtaining a4(1g, 2g, 3g, 4g) and
a4(1s, 2s, 4s, 3s) are given in gs. 2 and 3. note that in
each of the two cases the labels on the diagrams follow the
cyclic ordering of the arguments of the amplitudes. the
value of the rst of these partial amplitudes is well known
and may be found in, for example, ref. [14]. evaluating
the diagrams in g. 3, the four-scalar partial amplitude
is,

a4(1a1

s , 2a2

s , 4a4

s , 3a3

s ) = 2i

f a1a2bf a4a3b

f a2a4bf a3a1b

s13

,

where f abc = i tr(cid:0)[t a, t b]t c(cid:1)/2 are the group struc-

ture constants. this type of decomposition of group the-
ory and kinematics is rather unconventional. neverthe-
less, it is straightforward to verify that the amplitude in
eq. (3) is equal to that in eq. (2). similar decomposi-
tions hold for any number of external legs, by applying

2

n-point klt equations. in this way both graviton and
full gauge theory amplitudes satisfy klt equations, pro-
viding a natural way to obtain mixed amplitudes of states
appearing in gravity and in gauge theories.

with the sign of the helicity. they are antisymmetric,

with norm |hi ji| = | [i j]| = sij.

although d = 4 spinor helicity is quite useful, the
klt equations do not require its use, and are valid in
arbitrary dimensions. likewise, the conditions of max-
imal helicity violation are not essential, although they
considerably simplify amplitudes. we have, for example,
obtained all the independent amplitudes with ve glu-
ons and one graviton using the klt equations and the
six-gluon partial amplitudes given in ref. [14].

the cases corresponding to gravitationally dressed
parke-taylor amplitudes match those previously com-
puted by selivanov [13] using a generating function
method. selivanovs n-point expression for the coecient

in this factor legs i and j are the negative helicity ones
while the sets {h+} and {g+} represent the positive he-
licity graviton and gluon legs.
the klt equations immediately show that mixed
gluon and graviton amplitudes vanish if all legs have iden-
tical helicity or if there is a single leg of opposite helic-
ity, since the corresponding pure gluon [14] amplitudes
vanish. we also extrapolate our results to n-legs to ob-
tain the remaining non-vanishing mhv gluon amplitudes
dressed with gravitons. doing so yields,

for the coecient of the color traces tr[t ai  t aj ] which
follow the ordering of gluon legs. the complete ampli-
tudes are given by summing over non-cyclic permutations
of the gluon legs after multiplying by the color traces.
the function h(a,{p}, b) appearing in the last ampli-
tude is the half-soft function dened in ref. [5]. our con-
vention for the  helicity labeling is to take all legs
to be outgoing. in these amplitudes graviton exchanges
between gluons are not incorporated; such contributions
are suppressed by additional powers of the gravitational
coupling. we have expressed the amplitudes in terms of
d = 4 spinor inner products. (see e.g. ref. [14].) these
are denoted by hi ji = hi|j+i and [i j] = hi+|ji, where
|ii are massless weyl spinors of momentum ki, labeled

for the coecient of the color factor tr[t a1t a2  t am].
furthermore, the amplitudes where the gluons are all of
identical helicity vanish, independent of the graviton he-
licity conguration. these amplitudes were constructed
by demanding that they satisfy the required factoriza-
tion properties in all channels: the amplitudes have no
multi-particle poles, obey the collinear and soft factoriza-
tion for gluons given in ref. [14] and the ones for gravitons

given in ref. [5]. moreover, they have the correct phase
singularity for a gluon becoming collinear with a gravi-
ton. although this does not constitute a complete proof
that these results are valid for all n, in the past similar
analytic requirements have invariably led to the correct
results. (see e.g. refs. [12,15].)

the klt equation (1) can also be directly applied to
the case of a single fermion pair, by using the vertex
i/2 for the coupling of a fermion pair to a vector.
for example, in eq. (5) the result of replacing legs 1
and 2 by gluinos is given by multiplying by the over-
all factor h2 m + 1i / h1 m + 1i. this is consistent with
the result obtained by applying n = 1 supersymme-
try ward identities [16]. for fundamental representa-
tion quarks one must also modify the associated color
factor to (t a3  t am)2
. cases with a single gravitino
pair are similar. on the other hand, cases with multiple
fermion pairs are more intricate. in particular, for the
klt factorization to work, auxiliary rules for assigning
global charges in the color-ordered amplitudes appear to
be necessary.

i1

although, we do not have a general formalism, it is
interesting that a klt factorization can also be found
for examples with a massive graviton. for example, the
four-gluon amplitude with a massive graviton exchange
can be factorized as

it would be interesting to see if the relationships be-
tween gravity and gauge theories discussed here can be
extended to more general eld congurations.

the amplitudes on the left-hand-side using conventional
feynman rules.

the examples (6) and (7) suggest that it should be pos-
sible to obtain a general formalism for (massive) graviton
