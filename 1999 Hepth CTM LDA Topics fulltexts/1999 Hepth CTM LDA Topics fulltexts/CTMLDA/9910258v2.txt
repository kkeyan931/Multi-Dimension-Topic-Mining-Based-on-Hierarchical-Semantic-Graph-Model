abstract

in this note we will show that the  symmetry, namely the u (1) symmetry of the

open string sigma model which relates the b-eld and the u (1) gauge eld of a brane to

each other, is deformed to a noncommutative version in a constant b-eld background.

introduction

recently open strings in a constant b-eld background have been studied extensively

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. the main result obtained in these papers is that the world

volume of the branes in a b-eld background is a noncommutative space in terms of connes

noncommutative geometry.

the classical -model action in the b-eld background,

s = 1

4 r d2[gijax iax j + abbijax ibx j + 1

2 h d ai x i,

where a, is the u(1) gauge eld living on the d-brane, enjoys two u(1) symmetries,

-symmetry:

and -symmetry:

a  a + d,

(1)

(2)

(3)

b  b + d

a  a + 




it has been argued that -symmetry in the case of n coincident d-branes is enhanced to

the u(n) symmetry, while the -symmetry is believed to remain a u(1) which acts on the

u(1) part of the u(n) symmetry mentioned earlier [12]. in the case of the non-zero b-eld

background it has been argued that at the quantum level the -symmetry will be deformed

to a moyal gauge symmetry [1, 4, 9], however the -symmetry, has not been well studied in

these backgrounds. in all of the works mentioned above the noncommutativity was obtained

under the assumption of vanishing eld strength for the a eld at innity. however, in [13],

where a non-zero constant eld strength for the a eld was considered, it was shown that the

deformation parameter, , is not invariant under this classical -symmetry, in other words,

one should revise this symmetry at quantum level.

in this note, we would like to elaborate more on this symmetry. we show that this

symmetry just like the -symmetry, will be deformed to a moyal symmetry at quantum

level. it is worth noting that similar to the arguments of [9], this is the result of the point

splitting regularization we use.

calculations

to study the -symmetry at quantum level we use the path integral formulation and

rst we build the necessary tools for this calculation.

it was shown in [14] that the two point function of open strings, x i(z) z showing a point

in the upper half plane, constrained to the mixed boundary conditions,

gij(  )x j + bij( + )x j|z=z = 0,

in the decoupling limit, i.e.   0 and other parameter properly scaled [9], is 

< x i(z)x j(z) >= 

1
2

ijlog

z  z
z  z + dij,

where

ij = (

1
b

)ij,

(4)

(5)

(6)

and dij is a constant which does not depend on z, z and plays no essential role so we will set
it to zero. for the cases in which one of the operators is on the boundary, i.e. z = z =  ,
and the other at z =  + i,   0, the above propagator reads as:

< x i(z)x j(z) >= 

i


ij tan1



     

i


ijk(,  ;  ).

(7)

the equation (7) for the values of |   | <  in the   0 limit, does not dependent on 

and

< x i(z)x j(z) >= iij(   ),

(8)

where (x) is 1 or -1 for positive or negative x, respectively.

let us consider the action (1),

s(b, a) = s0 + z

d ai x i,

where s0 is the part of the action containing the string kinetic energy and the b-eld.

the propagator (7) has been calculated for this part. under the -symmetry, s(b, a) is

transformed as

s = s(b + d, a + )  s(b, a) = z

d d (cid:16)ix i(cid:17) .

(9)

as we expected it is a total time derivative, this is a classical symmetry.

in order to explore the -symmetry at quantum level, we study the partition function of

the theory under the -transformations:

z(b, a) = z dxes0+r

d ai x i

,

(10)

going to the decoupling limit makes the calculations and the results more clean and clear.

3

and hence

expanding (11) up to the rst order in a and , we obtain

z + z = z dxes0+r

d ai x i+s,

z = r dxes0(cid:18)r d ai x i.r d d  (ix i)(cid:19)

=: r d ai x i : : r d d  (ix i) :

= r d dd  (cid:18) : ai(x( ))j(x(,  )) ::  x i( )x j(,  ) : +

: ai(x( ))x j(,  ) ::  x i( )j(,  ) : (cid:19).

(11)

(12)

the above opes can be evaluated by means of (7), however performing the integration in
 , because of (8), one should note the time ordering of the operators. in the eld theory

language this corresponds to regularizing the eld products by the point splitting method

[9]. since we are only interested in the constant b and da backgrounds, for simplicity we
consider the  transformations which are linear in x i,

i =

1
2

fijxj,

(13)

where f is an arbitrary constant anti-symmetric two form. inserting (13) into (12) we nd

z =

1
2

ilkjfjl z d dd   (iak k k + kai k k) .

integrating over sigma by parts, we obtain

z =

1
2

ilkjfjl z d dd   (fik k k) ,

(14)

(15)

with

fik = kai  iak.

the equation (15) can be regularized by the point splitting and then we can perform the
integration in  . the answer expressed in terms of the moyal bracket is

z = i : z d d{ai, j}m.b. x i( )x j(,  ) :

,

where a is boundary valued.

to cancel this extra term we should deform the -symmetry as the following:




b  b + d + i{i, aj}m.b.

a  a + 

4

(16)

(17)

although we have presented the calculations only up to the rst order in the a eld, along

the lines of [9] it can be checked that the variations in any arbitrary power of a will cancel

out in lights of (17).

discussion

here we have shown that the -symmetry should be modied in the presence of the b-

eld, similarly to the -symmetry. the interesting point is that the  parameter is a function

of the background b-eld, and therefore is changed under a -transformation. hence the

parameter  is not invariant under this -symmetry.

another point we should note is that in order to use the noncommutative description

the background a eld should be set to zero at innity, by a proper -transformation, i.e.

 = a. under this -transformation the b-eld will transform as:

recalling that da = f , we nd

b  b = b  da  i{a, a},

b = b  (f 

1

f f ).

(18)

(19)

in the above relation the space-time indices have been summed over like matrix products.

the (19) is the same as the seiberg-witten map which relates the commutative and non-

commutative descriptions. in other words the results of dierent regularization methods are

related by this modied -symmetry. so, there is some hope that the deformed -symmetry

sheds light on the seiberg-witten map. studying this point and other physical consequences

of this symmetry is postponed to future works [15].
