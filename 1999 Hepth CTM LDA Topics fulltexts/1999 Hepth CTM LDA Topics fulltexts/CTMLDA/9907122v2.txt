abstract

we perform a 3d reduction of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation
based on sazdjians explicitly covariant propagator, combined with a co-
variant substitute of the projector on the positive-energy free states. we
use this combination in the two fermions in an external potential and in the
three-fermion problems. the covariance of the two-fermion propagators
insures the covariance of the two-body equations obtained by switching
o the external potential, or by switching o all interactions between any
pair of two fermions and the third one, even if the series giving the 3d
potential is limited to the born term or more generally truncated. the co-
variant substitute of the positive energy projector preserves the equations
against continuum dissolution without breaking the covariance.

the bethe-salpeter equation [1, 2] is the usual tool for the study of relativistic
bound states. the principal diculty in the treatment of this equation comes
from the existence of unphysical relative time variables. the most usual practice
in the two-fermion problem consists in eliminating the relative time variable
(3d reduction). this 3d reduction is most often based on the replacement of
the free green function by an expression combining a delta xing the relative
energy and a 3d propagator. the exact equivalence (in what concerns the
physically measurable quantities of the pure two-fermion problem) with the
original bethe-salpeter equation can be obtained by recuperating the dierence
with the original free green function in a series of correction terms to the 3d
potential.

the 3d reduction of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation has been per-
formed by many authors [3-19]. all methods are theoretically equivalent at

2

the limit of all correction terms included. beyond the two-fermion problem,
we have the cases of two fermions in an external potential ( 2 1
2 body problem)
and of three fermions (3-body problem). in these cases we meet new dicul-
ties which do not appear or can be easily solved in the two-fermion case: the
lorentz invariance / cluster separability problem and the continuum dissolution
problem.

 lorentz invariance and cluster separability. it is always possible to render
an equation lorentz invariant by working in the general rest frame (center of
mass reference frame) and by building invariants with the total 4-momentum
vector. the real diculty appears when we start with a three-fermion equation
and switch o all interactions between fermion 3 (for example) and the other
ones. we should get a free equation for fermion 3 and an acceptable equation
for the (12) system (cluster separability). in particular, this implies that the
equation for the (12) cluster must not refer to the global center of mass frame
anymore, as the momentum of fermion 3 enters in the denition of this frame.
this equation must therefore be invariant, explicitly or implicitly (i.e. after
rearrangements).

 solution of the continuum dissolution problem. in the relativistic equa-
tions for several relativistic particles, the physical bound states are degenerate
with a continuum of states combining asymptotically free particles with oppo-
site energy signs. this often neglected fact forbids the building of normalizable
solutions in the n > 2-body problem (including the two-body plus potential
problem). the usual solution consists in including positive-energy projection
operators into the zero-order propagator [20-26]. the modied equations must
of course continue to satisfy the lorentz invariance / cluster separability re-
quirement.

in our preceding works on the two-particles in an external potential problem
[23], and, more recently, on the three-fermion problem [26], our approach was
based on the cluster separability requirement.
in the three-fermion problem
the 3d potential was obtained by adding the three 3d potentials obtained by
the 3d reduction of the three two-fermion equations in the three-fermion rest
frame. each two-fermion potential depending in general of the total energy of
the subsystem, this two-fermion energy was taken as the three-fermion total
energy, minus the free dirac hamiltonian of the spectator fermion. the contin-
uum dissolution was avoided in both cases by choosing a two-fermion reduction
based on a 3d propagator containing a projector on the positive eigenvalues
eigenstates of the diracs free hamiltonian. with these choices the three two-
cluster limits are exact: switching o the two interaction terms with a spectator
fermion gives the exact 3d equation which would be obtained by the reduction
of the two-body bethe-salpeter equation. from this exact 3d equation for two
fermions it is possible to go back to the original two-fermion bethe-salpeter
equation and to perform the 3d reduction again in another reference frame, so
that we can consider this two-fermion equation as implicitly covariant. this
covariance is however quite implicit and global: neither the approached propa-

3

gator nor the positive-energy projector being covariant, the terms of the series
giving the 3d propagator are not individually covariant, so that the implicit
covariance becomes an approximated covariance when the series giving the 3d
potential is truncated, for example by keeping only the born term.

in the present work we combine sazdjians explicitly covariant propagator,
based on the second-order equations, with a covariant form of the positive-
energy projectors. when used in the 3d reduction of a two-fermion bethe-
salpeter equation, this combination leads to a 3d potential given by a series in
which each term is individually covariant. this potential can then be used in the
two-fermion in an external potential problem and in the three-fermion problem,
leading to continuum dissolution-free equations which can be truncated (for
example by keeping only the born terms) without losing the covariance of their
cluster-separated limits.

although our 3d equations have exact two-cluster limits, they are themselves
approximations. in the 2 1
2 body problem, one should take into account the
modications brought by the external potential to the fermion propagators also
inside the bethe-salpeter irreducible kernel.
in the three-body problem one
has to take into account the irreducible three-body terms at the bethe-salpeter
equation level and also the three-body terms generated at the 3d level by the
reduction. we tried to do that recently [26].

in section 2 we build a covariant propagator by combining sazdjians covariant
propagator with a covariant form of positive-energy projector. we use it to
perform a 3d reduction of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation and study
the resulting 3d equation (one-body limit, transition matrix elements, sym-
metrization of the potential). we present also a covariant salpeter propagator,
slightly more complicated but preserving the particle-antiparticle symmetry. in
the two next sections (3 and 4) we exploit these results by using our 3d po-
tentials in the two fermions in an external potential problem (with examples)
and in the three-fermion problem (with examples and with a calculation of the
two-body limits). section 5 is devoted to conclusions.

2 two fermions.

2.1 notations.

we shall write the bethe-salpeter equation for the bound states of two fermions
[1] as

 = g0k,

(1)

where  is the bethe-salpeter amplitude, function of the positions x1, x2 or
of the momenta p1, p2 of the fermions, according to the representation chosen.
the operator k is the bethe-salpeter kernel, given by the sum of the irreducible
two-fermion feynman graphs. the operator g0 is the free propagator, given by

g0

i =

pi0  hi + ihi

i =

pi0 + hi
i  m2
p2

i + i

i

where the hi are the dirac free hamiltonians

hi = ~i .~pi + i mi

(i = 1, 2).

(2)

(3)

we shall dene the total (or external, cm, global) and relative (or internal)
variables:

1
2

x =

(x1 + x2) ,

p = p1 + p2 ,

x = x1  x2 ,

p =

1
2

(p1  p2).

(4)

(5)

(7)

(8)

(9)

and give a name to the corresponding combinations of the free hamiltonians:

s = h1 + h2 ,

s =

1
2

(h1  h2).

(6)

we know that, at the no-interaction limit, we shall have to get a pair of free
dirac equations:

(p10  h1) = 0,

(p20  h2) = 0,

where  depends on x1, x2. let us also write their iterated versions

(p2

10  e2

1 ) = 0,

(p2

20  e2

2 ) = 0

with

ei =qh2

i = (~p2

i + m2
i )

2 .

interesting combinations can be obtained from the sum and dierences of the
equations (7) or of the iterated equations (8):

(p0  s) = 0,

(p0  s) = 0,

h 0 = 0,

(p0  ) = 0

with

h 0 = 2[(p2

(13)

2.2 sazdjians explicitly covariant propagator.

the free propagator g0 can be written

g0 = g02 (p10 + h1)(p20 + h2)12,

where g02 is the second-order (spinless) free propagator:

g02 =

1

(p2

10  e2

1 + i)(p2

20  e2

2 + i)

.

(14)

(15)

in a two-boson bethe-salpeter equation the free propagator g02 could be ap-
proached with the product gs2 of a constraint (p0  ) xing the relative
energy and forcing a solution of the free dierence equation (second equation
(11)) by a 3d propagator which could be the integral of g02 with respect to
the relative energy p0 :

with

gs2 = (p0 ) z dp0 g02(p0) = 4i (p0 )



p0h 0

 =

1
2

(1 + 2),

1 =

p0 + 2

2e1

,

2 =

p0  2

2e2

.

(16)

(17)

on the mass shell p0 = h1+h2, the operator i is the sign hi/ei of the energy
of the fermion i. the presence of  annihilates thus the residues of the poles
at p0 = (e1 e2), so that gs2 can be written

gs2 = 2i (p0 )

e1 + e2
2e1e2

1

p 2

0  (e1 + e2)2 + i

.

(18)

the propagator (16) could easily be written in covariant form if it did not
contain the operator . if we replace  by (p0) and add the spinor part of
(14), we obtain sazdjians propagator [12] :

gsz =

4i
|p0| h 0 (p0 ) (p10 + h1)(p20 + h2)12

which can also be written in covariant form

gsz = 2i  (p  p

or in a form which exhibits the pole in p0 s :

2.3 covariant positive-energy projectors.

the combination of two fermions with opposite energy signs leads to continuum
dissolution when an external potential or a third particle is added. the operator
 would have kill the unwanted poles of sazdjians propagator, but we could
not re-introduce it without losing the covariance. we have thus to search for an
invariant substitute of . a lorentz invariant operator forcing a positive energy
for fermion i could be

i = (pi0)(p2

i ) = (pi0  |~pi|)

(22)

as the sign of the energy is invariant for positive squared 4-momenta. taking
the product of two such operators (one for each fermion) and replacing p0 by
 gives

(25)

let us assume that the heaviest fermion is fermion 2. we can then write (23)
as

 = (cid:18) p0

2

+

1  q2

2p0

2

 | ~p1|(cid:19) (cid:18) p0

q2
2p0

 | ~p2|(cid:19)

with

q2 = q ~p 2

2 + m2

2  m2
1 .

the sum of the arguments of the two  is p0| ~p1|| ~p2|. the argument of the
rst  is ( p0  | ~p1|+ q2)( p0  | ~p1| q2)/2p0, which implies that p0 must be
outside the interval (| ~p1| q2, | ~p1|+ q2). the combination of these two results
implies p0 > | ~p1|+ q2. the second  brings no supplementary restriction, its
argument being always positive when p0 > | ~p1|+q2. we can thus write

 =  ( p0  | ~p1| q ~p 2

2 + m2

2  m2

1 ).

(26)

we see that our projection operator introduces a cuto on the high | ~pi| for a
given p0.

it is interesting to write  also in terms of the hi, for comparison with the
++  (h1)(h2) projector widely used by us [23, 26] and by others, and also
for future use in the two-fermion plus potential problem. we get

i = (pi0)(p2

i ) = (pi0) (p2

i0  h2

i + m2
i )

so that

 = (cid:2)(p10) (p2

1 = p2

10  h2

and also p2
2 so that the last  which concerns the heaviest
fermion can be omitted. for a given bound state energy p0,  eliminates the
mixed energy-sign continuum which would share this energy. when p0 = s,
(28) reduces indeed to (h1)(h2). in g. 1, we draw a map of the  = 1 region
in the (h1, h2) plane, for p0 xed to 2 (in arbitrary units) and dierent values
of the lowest mass m1 : 0, 0.5, 1 (solid line), 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 (while m2 can
take any value larger or equal to m1). we draw only the rst quadrant, the
other ones being the mirror images of the rst one. the  = 1 region is bounded
by the two pi0 = 0 curves, independent of the masses, and by the p2
1 = 0 curve
corresponding to the lowest mass m1. in each quadrant, this region is divided
into four parts, corresponding to the signs of h2
2 (as an
exemple, we indicate this partition in the m1 = 1, m2 = 1.1 case, for which p0
is thus 0.1 below the threshold 2.1). when no external potential is present, both
expressions are positive denite, the negative values being for the bound states
of the corresponding fermion in an external potential.

1 and h2

1  m2

2  m2

while the widely used ++  (h1)(h2) noncovariant projector simply se-
lects the rst quadrant, the  = 1 region is divided into four symmetric parts,
one for each quadrant, but there is a cuto on the high-|hi| values. for moder-
ately relativistic systems, the important regions are near the (m1, m2) point.

we shall thus nally approach the free propagator by the product of the

covariant sazdjian propagator with our covariant projector:

g =  gsz .

(30)

2.4 3d reduction of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equa-

tion.

we shall write the free propagator as the sum of the zero-order propagator, plus
a remainder:

g0 = g + gr.

the bethe-salpeter equation becomes then the inhomogeneous equation

 = g0k = (g + gr)k =  + grk,

with

 = gk

(= g(g0)1).

(31)

(32)

(33)

solving (formally) the inhomogeneous equation (32) with respect to  and
putting the result into (33), we get

 = gk(1  grk)1 = gk t 

(34)

8

where

obeys

k t = k(1  grk)1 = k + kgrk + ... = (1  kgr)1k

(35)

k t = k + kgrk t = k + k t grk.

(36)

the reduction series (35) re-introduces in fact the reducible graphs into the
bethe-salpeter kernel, but with g0 replaced by gr. equation (34) is a 3d
equivalent of the bethe-salpeter equation. it depends on the choice of g.

the relative energy dependence of eq. (34) can be easily eliminated:

and  satises the equation

 = (p0 ) 

 =

2i

p0  s + ip0

p0 + s
2 |p0|

 12 k t (, ) 

(37)

(38)

(39)

with

12k t (, )  z dp

0dp0(p

0 )12k t (p

0, p0)(p0 ).

note that we write (p
0, p0) but (, ), as we keep  in operator form. this
operator is diagonal in the spatial momentum space. the eigenvalue will depend
on the position of  in the formula: the eigenvalue of the rst  in (39) will
be built with the nal momenta and that of the last  will be built with the
initial momenta. dening

we get

v = 2i  12k t (, ) 

 =

1

p0 + s

p0  s + ip0

2 p0

v .

(40)

(41)

we included a nal  in the denition of v, as the wave function at right is
already projected, and we replaced |p0| by p0, which is always positive in the
 = 1 region.

the inversion of the reduction is given by

 = ( 1grk )1  = ( 1+grk t )  = ( 1+g0k t g k t )  = g0k t 
(42)

or, explicitating the relative energy variable

(p

0) = g0(p

0) k t (p

0, ) .

(43)

2.5 covariant salpeter equation.

a bethe-salpeter equation with an instantaneous kernel (i.e. a kernel indepen-
dent of the relative energy) leads directly to salpeters 3d equation [3]:

with

 =

1

p0  s + ip0

v s 

v s = 2i  12 k  2

 = (h1) (h2)  (h1) (h2).

(44)

(45)

(46)

when the kernel is not instantaneous, we can make an expansion based on the
approached propagator

gs = (p0 ) z dp0 g0(p0) = 2i (p0 )



p0  s + ip0

12

(47)

in the same way as above. this operator , which projects on the  2 = 1
subspace with a change of sign for the negative-energy part, is also a continuum
dissolution-preserving operator.

a covariant salpeter equation can easily be obtained by combining sazd-
jians covariant operator with a covariant substitue of  instead of a covariant
substitute of (h1)(h2). we could indeed use

s = (cid:20)(cid:2)(p10) (p20)  (p10) (p20)(cid:3) (p2

1) (p2

2)(cid:21)p0=

.

(48)

our 3d equation would then again be (41), but with the potential

v = 2i s 12k t (, ) (s)2

(49)

where k t must now be built using s instead of .

as the second term of (46) does not contribute much in practical calculations,
it is often omitted. for the same reason, we shall omit the second term of (48)
and use simply  in the present work. from a more fundamental point of view,
however, the use of  or of s preserves a particle-antiparticle symmetry which
is an important feature of relativistic theories.

2.6 one-body limit.

if we go to the center of mass reference frame, write p0 = m2 +w1 (for p0 > 0 )
and make m2   in the 3d equation (41), we get the equation

 =

1

w1  h1 + i

v ,

v = lim

m2  

v.

(50)

10

in [17], we showed that a 3d reduction performed with a propagator gsz, 
being a projector, leads to a 3d potential given by

v  =  (cid:20) v sz + v sz 1  

p0  s

v sz +   (cid:21) .

(51)

we also showed that the limit of v sz (let us call it v c ) is given by the
limit of the born term (a coulomb potential in qed). since the limit of  is
(w1  | ~p1|), we have thus

v = (w1  | ~p1|) v c(cid:18)1 

(| ~p1|  w1)

w1  h1

v c(cid:19)1

(w1  | ~p1|).

(52)

equation (50) is related to the equation

c =

1

w1  h1 + i

v c c

(53)

which describes the light fermion 1 in the potential generated by the heavy
fermion 2. we have

 = (w1  | ~p1|) c .

(54)

equation (50) is thus the exact equation for the projection (54) provided the
expansion of (52) is not truncated. if, however, the two-body potential is trun-
cated to the born term, its one-body limit will be the projection of v c instead
of v. the introduction of the projector  has destroyed the exact one-body
limit of the born approximation, as it would also be the case with other contin-
uum dissolution-preserving operators like ++.

2.7 transition matrix elements.

the 3d o mass shell transition matrix element is

t 3d = v + v

1

p0 + s

p0  s + ip0

2 p0

v +   

= 2i  12 (cid:2)k t + k t gk t +   (cid:3) (, ) 

k t + k t gk t +    = k(1grk)1(1  gk(1grk)1)1

k(1grk gk)1 = k(1g0k)1 = t

(55)

(56)

so that

t 3d = 2i  12 t (, ) .

(57)
on the positive-energy mass shell p0 = e1 + e2,  = 1 and t (, ) is the
physical on mass shell scattering matrix element of eld theory. although the
bethe-salpeter equation (1) was written only for bound states, our nal 3d
equation can still be used for describing the scattering.

11

2.8 symmetric form.

in our 3d equation (41), written in the form

(p0  s)  =

p0 + s

2p0

v 

(58)

the interaction term (the operator before  at right) is not symmetric and
depends on p0 via the operator before v and also via v itself. this does not
excludes a real energy spectrum, but this can not be seen directly on (58). in
the two-fermion framework, this is not a problem as there exist many ways of
transforming (58) into a symmetric equation. we shall however use these two-
fermion interaction terms in a three-fermion equation below (in section 4) and,
in this new framework, their symmetrization will not be possible anymore (it
would demand a dierent transformation for each two-fermion pair). in order
to be sure to get a real energy spectrum from our three-fermion equation, we
should thus symmetrize the interaction terms at the two-fermion level. this can
be done by simply multiplying (58) by 1+v /2p0, which gives

(p0  s)  = u ,

u = v  {p0 s ,

v
2p0

} +

v
2p0

(p0 + s)

v

.

(59)

(60)

in a 3d reduction based on the noncovariant projector (47), we would have
simply v s. the rst-order energy shift < v 2/2p0 > corresponding to the
dierence u v would then be included in the contribution of the rst ladder
term kgrsk, which enters in the denition of v s.

3 two fermions in an external potential.

3.1 3d equation.

the two-fermion in an external potential problem is already much more compli-
cated than the pure two-fermion problem, although it exhibits some simplifying
features when compared with the three-fermion problem. the principal new
diculty is the non-conservation of the total spatial momentum ~p . in the pure
two-fermion case, this conservation law forbids the mixing of the physical bound
states with the mixed-energy states (continuum dissolution). when an external
potential is present, it becomes possible to get any given energy in an innity of
ways by combining fermions with opposite free energy signs. the positive-energy
bound states will then not be normalizable, being mixed with a continuum.

the two-fermion plus external potential equations can easily be obtained

with the simple generalizations [23]

hi  hie = ~i .~pi + i mi + vi(~xi, i)

(61)

12

where vi is the external potential acting on fermion i. these substitutions must
be done in the free bethe-salpeter propagator g0 and in the manipulations
leading to the 3d equation (this is an approximation, as we should also modify
the fermion propagators inside the irreducible graphs, but this gives the exact
cluster-separated limits). we get

p0  = (cid:20) se +

p0 + se

besides the free-free continuum, the (h1e, h2e) spectrum (for which we can
use gure 1) contains now bound-free or free-bound combinations (lines) and
bound-bound combinations (points). the equations are written in the labo-
ratory reference frame, dened as the reference frame in which the external
potential is static. when the mutual interaction is switched o, we get a pair
of independent dirac equations in the external potential. when the external
potential is switched o, we get the equation of a system of two mutually in-
teracting fermions. this last equation can be written in covariant form, the
contribution of each term of (67) being separately invariant. we can keep only
the born term (only k in k t
e and only the ladder term in k ) without losing
this covariance.

3.2 examples.

3.2.1 two electrons in the eld of a nucleus.

in this case, the external potentials are given by (in conguration space):

v1 =

ze2

,

v2 =

ze2
|~x2|

.

(69)

for the mutual interaction kernel we have to choose a gauge.

(1  2),

(71)

this last gauge being not covariant, the space-time separation refers to the
laboratory frame. this gauge is not a priori a good choice for our covariant
calculation.
in the two-fermion problem, however, it is well known that the
best choice for the calculation of the energy spectrum is coulombs gauge in the
center of mass reference frame. we could take this fact into account by writing
(71) for a pure two-fermion system in the two-fermion center of mass reference
frame ~p = 0, making everything covariant by using p :

12 

(1 p )(2 p )

p 2

,

~a~b 

(ap )(bp )

p 2

 (ab) ,

(72)

and importing the result into the two-fermion in an external potential problem,
where ~p is no more conserved. we could call this the covariant coulomb
gauge.

we have now to compute ve by using (64), with k t

e = k given by (70).
the principal diculty comes from the fact that the modied dirac operators
hie are diagonal neither in momentum space, nor in conguration space. if we
expand the potential ve into the eigenfunctions of the hie, it will be given by
(in feynmans gauge):

ve(~p

(74)

where i(~pi) is an eigenstate of hie with eigenvalue i. the sum in (73)
includes also an integral on the continuum. this expression is well adapted to
a perturbation calculation starting with an eigenstate of se. the rst-order
energy shift will indeed be < i | ve | i >, in which e(i) will be equal to 1,
as p0 = 1+2.

3.2.2 positronium in an external potential.

for the positronium in an external potential, the mutual interaction kernel
and potential in the born approximation (neglecting the annihilation graph)
are the same as for the two-electron pair above, with a change of sign. the
external potentials could again be the potentials generated by a nucleus, and
we would write again (69), with a change of sign for the positron. we could
also consider non-central potentials (as v1 = ex13, v2 = ex23 for a constant
electric eld along the third axis). the representation of ve in the space of the
eigenfunctions of the modied dirac operators gives a meaning to our rather
formal expression (64), but it is not well adapted to this new framework, as the
principal interaction is now the binding mutual interaction. we shall therefore
isolate a zero-order coulomb contribution from ve :

4 three fermions.

4.1 3d equation.

it is easy to build a three-fermion 3d equation with three two-fermion potentials
uij(pij0) (we explicitate for a while the dependence in the total energy of the
two fermions):

(p0  s)  = [ u12(p0 h3) + u23(p0 h1) + u31(p0 h2) ] 

(77)

with s = h1 + h2 + h3. we have replaced the arguments pij0, by the operators
p0hk in order to get the exact cluster-separated limits. at the v23 = v31 = 0
limit, for example, we get indeed

writing

(cid:20) p0  h1  h2  h3(cid:21)  = u12(p0 h3) .

 = 12 3,

p0 = p120 + p30

(78)

(79)

we get two independent equations:

(cid:20) p120  h1  h2(cid:21) 12 = u12(p120) 12,

p30 3 = h3 3

(80)

15

as p0 h3 can be replaced by p0 p30 = p120. our 3d equation (77) satises
thus clearly the cluster separability requirement. furthermore, the three cluster-
separated limits are exactly the 3d equations we would get by 3d-reducing the
corresponding two-fermion bethe-salpeter equations. this cluster separability
is a property of the equation, or, if we prefer, of the full green function. for a
given scattering solution it is also possible to take the cluster-separated limit at
xed p. this is not possible for the bound state solutions.

our use of a covariant approached propagator results in an explicit covari-
ance of the cluster-separated limit equations like (80): this equation can directly
be written in covariant form and each term of the series giving the 3d potential
is separately covariant. we could thus neglect all terms of k t but the born
term without losing the covariance of the cluster-separated limits.

let us recapitulate the elements of our 3d equation (77) (we give only u12) :

u12 = v12  {p0 s,

4.2 two-body limits.

it is interesting to compare the two-body limits (say m3   ) of our three-
fermion equations with our two-fermion in an external potential equations.
writing p0 = m3 + p120 and making m3  , we get

p120  = ( h1 + h2 + v1 + v2 + u12 ) 

(87)

where u12 is still given by (81), with p0 h3 replaced by p120, while

(89)
we note the following dierences with the two-fermion in an external potential
equation:

 in the mutual interaction term (which takes its symmetrized form), the

free dirac operators hi are not replaced by the operators hie.

 the external potentials are projected, as in the one-body limit (52). the
energy argument w1 is here p120  h2 (and vice-versa).
is energy-
dependent (to consider more general cases than a pure coulomb potential) its
energy argument will also be replaced by p120 h2.

if v c

the dierence between both approaches consists clearly in three-body terms.
the cluster-separated limits are still exact, as they were before taking the m3 
 limit. these cluster-separated limits appear when two of the three two-
body interactions are switched o. when only the mutual interaction v12 is
switched o, we do not completely get two independent equations as in section
3. writing p120 = p10 + p20, we see that v1 will depend on p20h2 and v2 on
p10h1. it must however be noted that the external potentials obtained by the
m3   limit are less general than the external potential we could consider in
the formalism of section 3: here we expect central potentials decreasing with the
distance. with such potentials, it is not possible to let fermion 1 (for example)
go to innity without having both v12 and v31 going to zero.

while v31 = v23 (1  2). we could also use the invariant coulomb gauge
(in fact, one gauge for each two-fermion subsystem). if we had started with
a true three-fermion bethe-salpeter equation we could not use three dierent
gauges simultaneously, but here our aim is only to get continuum dissolution-free
equations with the correct cluster-separated limits.

5 conclusions.

using the explicitly covariant sazdjian propagator combined with our covari-
ant substitute of the positive-energy projector, we built a 3d equation for two
fermions in an external potential and for three fermions. the two-fermion equa-
tions obtained at the cluster separated limits are these which would be obtained
by a 3d reduction of the two-fermion bethe-salpeter equation. in our preceding
works this implied that these cluster-separated limits were implicitly covariant
if not truncated, even if they remained written in a specic reference frame
(the laboratory frame or the three-fermion rest frame). in the present work,
however, they are explicitly covariant, which implies that the covariance will
survive the possible truncations of the 3d potentials. the invariant substitute
of the positive energy projector we use brings a cuto on the spatial momenta,
which could be welcome when insuring the existence of some integrals. this
cuto appear for rather low, but nevertheless truly relativistic values. it is not

18

by itself an approximation: it reects the choice to work with a given projection
of the two-fermion equation.

the 3d equations we write in this work are more complicated that the
corresponding equations in our preceding works. keeping in mind that in both
cases the 3d potentials are given by series to be truncated anyway, we hope
that the lorentz invariance / cluster separability properties of the truncations
of the present equations will lead to a better approach of the real physics in the
rst terms.
