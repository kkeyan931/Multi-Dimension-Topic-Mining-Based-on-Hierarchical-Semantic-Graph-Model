compactified quantum fields. is there life beyond

the cut-off scale?

corneliu sochichiu

abstract. a consistent denition of high dimensional compactied quantum
eld theory without breaking the kaluzaklein tower is proposed. it is possible
in the limit when the size of compact dimensions is of the order of the cut o.
this limit is nontrivial and depends on the geometry of compact dimensions.
possible consequences are discussed for the scalar model.

introduction

the nature at high energies is supposed to be described by some string models
(see e.g.
[1]). in the local approximation the strings are known to be described
at tree level eld models. strings are formulated in high-dimensional space-time,
therefore the respective eld models are also high-dimensional. the low energy
observable world, however, is low-dimensional and is described by local quantum
eld theories. compactication provides a mechanism that lower the eective di-
mensionality of the model in low energy limit. in 80s it was shown (see [2]) that at
classical level compactication may lead to low-dimensional (d = 4) unied models
through kaluzaklein mechanism.

thus, one is justied to expect the compactication to appear due to quan-
tum corrections to the high-dimensional eld model. the main problem the quan-
tum treatment is faced with is one of non-renormalisability proper for the high-
dimensional eld models.

the possible one-loop counterterms arising in high-dimensional quantum eld
models were computed many years ago [3], and are known indeed to lead to non-
renormalisability of the eective action at any nite size of the compact dimensions.
the model become worse as the number of compact dimensions increase.

the non-renormalisability in high dimensions is an uv feature and it persists
also in compactied models (unless the compactication size reach the uv region!).
a way to avoid the problem with non-renormalisability would be consideration
of a larger model, i.e. of the string theory1 in the case when the high dimensional
model under consideration is the eective eld theory for such a string model, in
this case to absorb the non-renormalisable divergences one has to consider nonlocal
modes, thus leaving the framework of local eld theory.

the careful analysis here can, probably, be done but the eld theoretical ap-
proach is simpler and, we believe, more instructive. we believe that the quantum

1in refs. [4], the problem of the supersymmetry breaking and coupling renormalisation induced
by compactication was studied in the framework of string theory. it was shown that for some
compactications the the low dimensional models feel extra dimensions at energies  1 t ev .

eld theory approach starts to be applicable when the size of the compact dimen-
sions is close enough to zero. quantitatively this may happen when the size of
compact dimensions is of the order of uv cuto (or even higher), i.e. when the
contribution of the order of size of compact dimensions is negligible.

compactication can be realised in dierent ways the simplest one being when
the high-dimensional space-time is represented as a product of a compact space
with (low-dimensional) minkowski space-time. compactication to circle of the
scalar eld was considered in our previous work [5].

spectrum of compactied models consists of propagating part which correspond
to modes which are constant in the compact directions, they form the eld con-
tent of the low-dimensional model. beyond the propagating part there is an innite
number of massive kaluzaklein (kk) modes. their masses are of the order of in-
verse specic size of the compact dimensions. when this size is small, the respective
masses are large and kk modes cannot propagate in low dimensions, but due to
interaction with propagating modes their quantum uctuations can inuence the
dynamics of the latter even at low energies.

the aim of the actual paper is to investigate which is the condition of exis-
tence of compactied model as a renormalisable low-dimensional eective quantum
eld theory, and which is the eect of the high-dimensions to this theory. these
days phenomenological aspects of the compactied high dimensional models are
intensively studied in the framework of gut building, (for a review see e.g.
[6]),
although the nature of compactied models as qft in these investigations is not
yet clear. we hope that actual study claries some of these points.

our aim is integration of kk modes in order to get the low dimensional eective
action for remaining propagating elds. the non-renormalisability problem here
takes the form of divergence of the sums over the kk contributions in some feynman
diagrams although the loop contribution of each kk eld corresponding to this
diagram taken separately is renormalisable and vanishes due in the limit of the
small compactication size. these divergencies, however, are regularised by the
same uv regularisation we use to compute each kk diagram. combining cuto
removing with the zero limit of the compactication size one may get some nite
contribution to eective action from the kk modes. it may seem that in this limit
the model is trivially reduced to a low dimensional one which forgot everything
about the higher dimensions. we show that even there the low dimensional eective
model has strong dependence on the geometry of compact dimensions.

such a combined limiting procedure means that the (physical) size of compact
dimensions is in uv region. in other words the validity of qft approach is lim-
ited to energies below the inverse compactication size. also, we consider that
at energies where the qft approach is applicable gravity is in its classical regime.
otherwise, one is thrown from the local qft approach due to non-renormalisability
of gravitational interactions.

the plan of the paper is as follows. we consider scalar model with 

4! 4 interac-
tion in a high-dimensional space-time. first we compactify the space-time on the
product of low-dimensional minkowski space-time and a compact riemannian man-
ifold. after that we integrate over kk and high energy modes of propagating eld
i.e. nd their one loop-contribution. then we nd the renormalisability conditions
for obtained model, and, nally analyse the dependence of the low dimensional
model on the compactication geometry.

we assume potential v () to be renormalisable in d-dimensions. thus if one
compacties this model to d = 4 the potential v () should be at most quartic in

faster than any power of n = kn1 +  + n4k (where k  k is some properly dened

action term (16) and kk propagator (17) is of the same form as interaction term
in (12) and propagator for pv elds (18). this allows one to include kk and pv
elds in the same set. from now on let the index n span both kk and pv elds.
consider diagrams with kk/pv elds running in the loop and with external 

legs.

in what follows we use dimensional regularisation for kk-elds and pv regula-
tors. general one-loop diagram with 2n (truncated) external legs has n vertices
and looks as follows,

is the dimensionless coupling and  is the mass unity. summation in (19) and on
is performed through the eigenvalue lattice of  where zero term is substituted by
pv regulator. cuto removing is obtained when d  d.
the formal divergence index of this diagram is g = d  2n . this index,
however, is computed termwise and does not reect possible divergencies due to
the summation over n. from above it follows the termwise divergencies described
by g are the same for kk an pv modes. they are due to large momenta in
low dimensional directions and have low dimensional nature. from the other hand,
divergencies due to summation over kk modes correspond to large momenta in
compactied directions and, thus they have the high-dimensional nature.

expression in the r.h.s. of eq (24) can diverge in the limit d  d due to the
following two factors. first one is singularity of some i(r)( d) and second one is
singularity of (s).

singularities of i(r) does not depend on index n. therefore, the renormalisability
of the low dimensional reduced model implies possibility to eliminate also singu-
larities of this type due to kk modes by a modication of already existing low
dimensional counter-terms. let us note that i(r) is proportional to the factor,

consider now divergencies due to singularities of -function. it is known, that

simple poles on the real axis at s = p/2 n, n = 0, 1, . . . ,(cid:2) p

one can observe that -function variable is related to the external divergence

to several diagrams with negative divergence index.
in low dimensional theory
such diagrams are convergent and there are no terms in the bar action (11) to allow
absorbtion of the divergent part corresponding to such diagrams. in order to avoid
the non-renormalisability one have to get rid of such contribution.

to do this consider invariants a2n(). they arise as quotients in expansion of

condition (32) provides that limit   0 is reached faster than cuto is removed
which guarantee that after the cuto removing no term with g,r < 0 will survive
(cfy. eq (24)). thus, the only contribution which survives in this limit is given by
the terms which renormalise the bar action (11).

from eq. (32) it follows that cuto removing d  d, and the limit   0 must

physically, such a limiting procedure means that the size of compact dimensions
should be below the scale of low dimensional eective quantum eld theory or
physically zero. in other words, the quantum eld theoretical approach is limited
to energies much smaller than the inverse size of compact dimensions. this is
required to make sense of compactied model as a quantum eld one.

as a result the eective theory is described by the same action (11) but with
mass m and coupling  substituted by renormalised quantities. in general one can

let us consider non-vanishing terms in more details, assuming that d = 4 and
potential is given by (2). these terms correspond to integrals with g,r  0 and
are low-dimensionally uv divergent. as we already mentioned this terms produce
only renormalisation of the bar action (11). there are only two diagrams which
contribute in one-loop approach in our model. they are, respectively, two-point

as we expected the contribution of the kk and pv elds reduces in the limit
  0 to mass and coupling renormalisation which at rst look seems trivial. in
fact, at energies    1 the low dimensional eective model we obtained does
not feel directly the uctuations along kp, however, as one can see from eqs. (42)
and (43) the coupling/mass renormalisation is sensible to geometry of kp through
-function and  present in the counterterms. thus, if the shape of kp is varied the
eect of such variation consists in nite counterterms renormalising respectively
the coupling and the mass of propagating eld . this ow aects renormalised
physical quantities as well, provided uctuations of  with momenta below 1 are
taken into consideration. this is because the geometry dependent counterterms
cannot be cancelled by constant ones.

flow of the parameters under the variation of the compact size  can be com-
puted using renormalisation group methods. if one renormalises the parameters at
some value of the compact size 0 and than vary it one encounters some ow of
the renormalised parameters (renormalisation is -independent), mr = mr() and
r = r(). by dimensional arguments it is clear that this ow is governed by the
renormalisation group. for example, for the renormalised coupling one can write,

discussions

in the actual paper we considered compactications of high-dimensional quan-

tum eld models.

we have shown, that a renormalisable compactied model can be dened when
the size of compact dimensions is of the order of cuto scale of the low dimensional
model. in dimensional regularisation scheme this corresponds to vanishing of the
size of compact dimensions when the cut o dimension d approaches the physical
value d.

in condition (33), (34) we required that the compact size decays faster than
cuto is removed. this condition arose from the requirement not to have nonrenor-
malisable terms in the low dimensional eective theory.
in fact, one can try to
slightly relax this condition by requiring,

rather than zero. our analysis in this case still remains applicable, but resulting
model will not be a renormalisable one.

indeed, condition (47) still leads to absence of nonrenormalisable innite contri-
butions to the eective action, but in this case beyond the mass/coupling renormal-
isation one would have new nite terms in the eective action of the following types
(2)2 and 6 (in general also terms like (2)2 may appear, however in one-loop
they are absent). these are, so called, ir irrelevant operators so, if the energy scale
is lowered they are believed to decouple then one recovers the old situation. due
to the presence of higher derivative terms this this non-renormalisability could be
interpreted as eective switch-on of additional degrees of freedom from the compact
dimensions.

having our results at hand one can draw the following qualitative physical pic-
ture. at energies much lower than the size of compact dimensions one has a renor-
malisable low dimensional qft whose parameters depend on the geometry of com-
pact dimensions. when the energy is increased new degrees of freedom appear, due
to the non-renormalisable interactions and higher order terms at energy   1.
an alternative approach to dene a renormalisable compact model may consist
in compactications to non-commutative compact manifolds [10]. fields on non-
commutative spaces [12] are now under intensive study in connection with matrix
models, [11].

so far, we considered the scalar eld model. however, generalisation to other

models both ordinary and supersymmetric is more or less straightforward.

in fact one can consider more general compactications, when manifold wd+p
is a bre bundle wd+p = md  kp, where minkowski space md is the base and
kp is the bre. in actual paper one may consider that compactication is of the
later type but the ber kp depends on minkowski space time-point adiabatically.

the last means that for large enough space-time regions this bre bundle should
look almost as a direct product.

before concluding let us make a few comments. first, let us note that coupling
ow (46) diers from the standard ow one would have in the 4 model by a factor
(1 ap) in the denominator. this factor in general changes the rate of the ow and
in the case when ap  1 even its character. for p = 2, 4 e.g. the respective ap are
given by second and third eqs. (30).
in actual paper we neglected contributions of the order o(m22). these can be
taken into consideration by substituting  by  + m2 in eq. (5) and (6), which
results in using -function of  + m2 rather than one of . all analysis in this case
remain the same except a slight modication of heat kernel invariants (30).

renormalisation group ow (46) makes sense only when theory is well-dened
also beyond the one loop. although our analysis heavily used specic one-loop
tools, such as paulivillars regularisation and zeta function sums this analysis can
be extended beyond one-loop by some technical modications, and, we believe, the
present conclusions to remain valid.
