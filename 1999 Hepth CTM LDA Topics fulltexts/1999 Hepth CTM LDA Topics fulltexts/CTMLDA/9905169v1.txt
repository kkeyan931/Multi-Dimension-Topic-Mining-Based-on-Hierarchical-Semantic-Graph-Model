abstract

for n > 2 we present static monopole solutions of the second order su (n ) bps
yang-mills-higgs equations which are not solutions of the rst order bogomolny
equations. these spherically symmetric solutions may be interpreted as monopole
anti-monopole congurations and their construction involves harmonic maps into
complex projective spaces.

1 introduction

in this paper we study static monopole solutions of the su(n) yang-mills-higgs
equations in ir3, in the bps limit of vanishing higgs potential. it is well known that the
solutions which correspond to the global minima of the yang-mills-higgs energy functional
are all given by solutions of the simpler rst order bogomolny equations [2]. however, as
proved by taubes [7] using innite dimensional morse theory, there are more solutions to
the yang-mills-higgs equations than just the bogomolny ones. these solutions are saddle
points of the energy functional and correspond to monopole anti-monopole congurations,
which have an instability to annihilation.

we construct a class of spherically symmetric su(n) non-bogomolny monopoles and
calculate some of their properties, such as magnetic charges and energies. it is interesting
that this construction involves harmonic maps of the plane into cipn1. atiyah [1] has
described a relationship between instantons in two and four dimensions, and by reduction
a correspondence between su(n) hyperbolic bogomolny monopoles and instantons of the
two-dimensional cipn1 sigma model. our non-bogomolny solutions are obtained by using
the non-instanton solutions of the cipn1 sigma model and so our results appear to suggest
that atiyahs connection between bogomolny monopoles and sigma model instantons may
have some form of an extension outside the self-dual sector. in any case, it is clear that we
have found some monopole analogues of the sigma model non-instanton solutions.

2 su(n) monopoles

static monopoles are solutions of the su(n) yang-mills-higgs equations in ir3 which,

in the bps limit of a massless higgs, are derived from the energy functional

e = 

1

4 z tr{(di)2 +

1
2

f 2

ij} d3x

(2.1)

where ai, for i = 1, 2, 3, is the su(n)-valued gauge potential, with eld strength fij =
iaj  jai + [ai, aj], and  is the su(n)-valued higgs eld. variation of the energy (2.1)
gives the second order yang-mills-higgs equations

didi = 0, difij = [dj, ].

(2.2)

the boundary conditions are that the energy is nite and that, in a chosen direction
(say along the x3-axis), the higgs eld at innity is a given constant diagonal matrix,
(0, 0, ) = i0 where

0 = diag(1, 2, ..., n ).

(2.3)

here we choose the ordering such that 1  2  ..  n and because   su(n) we have

that pn

i=1 i = 0.

at large radius, the magnetic eld, bk = 1

2kijfij, has the leading order behaviour

bk 

ibxk
2r2 g(bx1,bx2,bx3)

2

(2.4)

where the matrix g contains n  1 integers, ni, which are the magnetic charges [4] and
provide a topological characterization of the monopole solution. since we impose the
framing condition (2.3) along the x3-axis, then along this axis we have that

g0 = g(0, 0, 1) = diag(n1, n2  n1, . . . , nn1  nn2, nn1).

(2.5)

by completing the square in the energy density (2.1) the bogomolny bound [2] is obtained
as

1

4z tr{(di  bi)2  2bidi} d3x

e = 

 |(1  2)n1 + (2  3)n2 + . . . + (n1  n )nn1|.

(2.6)

(2.7)

the inequality (2.7) is obtained by noting that the nal term in (2.6) can be written as
a total derivative and as such can be expressed in terms of the magnetic charges and the
eigenvalues of the higgs eld at innity.

clearly, within each magnetic charge sector the minimal energy solutions are obtained

by solving the bogomolny equations

di = bi

(2.8)

whose solutions saturate the energy bound. the upper sign corresponds to monopoles, that
is, ni  0, whereas choosing the lower sign, which we shall refer to as the anti-bogomolny
equations, results in anti-monopoles with ni  0.

from the energy bound (2.7), which gives the energy for bogomolny monopoles, it
can be seen that the dierence mj = j  j+1 determines the mass of the monopole of
type j, of which there are nj in total. if the eigenvalues of the higgs eld are not distinct,
say j = j+1, then mj = 0, that is, the monopole of type j is massless and the integer nj
does not appear in the bogomolny bound (2.7). this reects the fact that nj is no longer
a topological quantity.
in this case the residual symmetry group is non-abelian, rather
than being the maximal torus u(1)n1, and the integer nj is not a magnetic charge. to
distinguish these cases such integers are referred to as magnetic weights [4].

although the global minima of the energy functional (2.1) are all obtained as bogomolny
monopoles, that is, solutions of the bogomolny equations (2.8), taubes [7] has proved the
existence of other critical points.
in other words, there are solutions of the full second
order yang-mills-higgs equations (2.2) which are not solutions of the rst order bogomolny
equations (2.8). in the following sections we construct examples of spherically symmetric
non-bogomolny monopoles and investigate some of their properties.
in general it is a
much more dicult task to solve the full yang-mills-higgs equations than the bogomolny
equations, not just because the equations are second order instead of rst order, but because
the bogomolny equations are integrable and so a variety of techniques from integrable
systems can be applied, whereas this property is lost for the yang-mills-higgs equations.

3 the harmonic map ansatz

the starting point for our investigation is the introduction of the coordinates r, z, z
on ir3. in terms of the usual spherical coordinates r, ,  the riemann sphere variable is
z = ei tan(/2). using these coordinates the yang-mills-higgs equations (2.2) take the
form

[dr, ] =

(1 + |z|2)2

2r2

(dzfr z + dzfrz)

dr(r2dr) = 

(dzdz + dzdz)

[dz, ] + drfrz =

(1 + |z|2)2

2

1
2r2 dz((1 + |z|2)2fz z)

and the bogomolny equations (2.8) become

idz = frz,

idr =

(1 + |z|2)2

2r2

fz z.

from equation (2.4) the matrix of magnetic charges, g, is given by

g = (1 + |z|2)2fzz

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

where the right hand side of the above is evaluated on the two-sphere at r = .

our ansatz for su(n) monopoles is to set

 = i

hj(pj 

1
n

n2xj=0

), az =

n2xj=0

gj[pj, zpj], ar = 0

(3.6)

where hj(r), gj(r) are real functions depending only on the radial coordinate r, and pj(z, z)
are n n hermitian projectors, that is, pj = p j = p 2
j , which are independent of the radius
r. the set of n  1 projectors are taken to be orthogonal, so that pipj = 0 for i 6= j. note
that we are working in a real gauge, so that az = az. in (3.6), and for the remainder of
the paper, we drop the summation convention.

the above ansatz is motivated by our recent study [5] of bogomolny monopoles and
their construction in terms of harmonic maps. in the case of bogomolny monopoles it was
convenient to a choose a particular complex gauge, but the existence of this complex gauge
choice relies on a solution of the bogomolny equations and in general is not valid for the
yang-mills-higgs equations. however, after converting these bogomolny solutions to a real
gauge they have the above form, although the ansatz (3.6) is more general.

substituting the ansatz (3.6) into the yang-mills-higgs equations one nds that the
left hand side of equation (3.1) is identically zero. this follows from the fact that the
projectors are independent of r and form an orthogonal set. the requirement that the
right hand side of equation (3.1) is zero gives the following condition

gj[pj, zzpj] = 0.

n2xj=0

4

(3.7)

the equation

[p, zzp ] = 0

(3.8)

is the harmonic map equation of the two-dimensional cipn1 sigma model (see for example
ref.[8]). thus we take each pj to be a harmonic map and then the rst yang-mills-higgs
equation (3.1) is automatically satised. it is satisfying that the harmonic map equation
emerges naturally from the yang-mills-higgs equations since in the study of bogomolny
monopoles it was found [5] to be useful to introduce harmonic maps but the equations
themselves did not appear.

to proceed further we need to briey recall some results about harmonic maps of the
two-dimensional cipn1 sigma model. see zakrzewski [8] for a more detailed account of
two-dimensional sigma models and their solutions.

if we regard the second order harmonic map equation (3.8) as a lower dimensional
analogue of the yang-mills-higgs equations (2.2), then the analogue of the rst order
bogomolny equations (2.8) is the instanton equation

whose solutions automatically satisfy the harmonic map equation (3.8). the instanton
equation (3.9) is easy to solve, with the general solution being given by

p zp = 0

(3.9)

p (f ) =

f f
|f |2

(3.10)

where f (z) is an n-component column vector which is a holomorphic function of z and
whose degree is equal to the instanton number of the sigma model. another set of solutions
are the anti-instantons, which satisfy the equation p zp = 0, and have the same form as
the instanton solutions but this time f is an anti-holomorphic function. for anti-instantons
the sigma model instanton number is minus the degree of f.

for n = 2 these are all the nite action solutions to (3.8), but for n > 2 there are
other non-instanton solutions. these can be obtained from the instanton solutions by a
process of dierentiation and gram-schmidt orthogonalization. explicitly, introduce the
operator  dened by its action on any vector f  c n as

f = zf 

f (f zf )

|f |2

(3.11)

and then dene further vectors kf by induction as kf = (k1f ).

when calculating with these objects it is useful to be aware of the following properties

[8] of kf when f is holomorphic:

(kf ) lf = 0,

k 6= l

z(cid:16)kf(cid:17) = k1f

|kf |2
|k1f |2 ,

5

z  k1f

|k1f |2! =

kf

|k1f |2 .

(3.12)

(3.13)

dening the projectors pk corresponding to the family of vectors kf , that is,

pk = p (kf ), k = 0, .., n  1

(3.14)

gives our required set of orthogonal harmonic maps. since the projectors obtained from this
k=0 pk = 1 and we are going to be taking arbitrary

sequence always satisfy the relation pn1
linear combinations, then we can neglect the nal projector pn1.

note that applying  a total of n  1 times to a holomorphic vector gives an anti-
holomorphic vector, so that a further application of  gives the zero vector and hence no
corresponding projector. in the cip1 case the operator  converts a holomorphic vector
to an anti-holomorphic vector, that is, instantons to anti-instantons and these are all the
solutions in this case.

in order for our ansatz (3.6) to give solutions to the two remaining yang-mills-higgs
equations, (3.2) and (3.3), the harmonic maps used must have spherical symmetry 
essentially the factors of (1 + |z|2)2 which appear in the yang-mills-higgs equations must
be cancelled. the required harmonic maps are obtained by applying the above procedure
to the initial holomorphic vector

f = (f0, ..., fj, ..., fn1)t, where fj = zjvuut n  1
j !

(3.15)

and (cid:16)n1

j (cid:17) denote the binomial coecients. for a discussion of the spherical symmetry

of these maps see ref.[5]. here we merely point out that it is at least plausible that the
required factors do indeed cancel since |f |2 = (1 + |z|2)n1.

in the following sections we shall describe the non-bogomolny monopoles obtained from
our harmonic map ansatz in some detail for the simplest cases of su(3) and su(4). the
situation for general su(n) will then become clear.

4 spherical monopoles

in dealing with the equations which arise from the harmonic map ansatz (3.6) it is
convenient to exchange the prole functions hj(r), gj(r) for the functions bj(r), cj(r) which
are dened as the following linear combinations

hj =

n2xk=j

bk,

cj = 1  gj  gj+1,

for j = 0, . . . , n  2.

(4.1)

in the above we have dened gn1 = 0. provided the eigenvalues of the higgs eld at
innity are correctly ordered, as in (2.3) (which corresponds to bj()  0), then the
monopole masses are simply given by the asymptotic values of the functions bj(r), that is,
mj = bj1() for j = 1, . . . , n  1. thus if bj() = 0 this signals a change of symmetry
breaking to a non-maximal case. this will be an important point in what follows. for the
ansatz to be well-dened at the origin the boundary conditions bj(0) = 0 and cj(0) = 1 for
all j = 0, . . . , n  2, must be imposed.

4.1 su(2)

as we have mentioned in section 3, there are no non-instanton solutions of the cip1
sigma model and hence we cannot employ our ansatz to obtain non-bogomolny monopoles
for gauge group su(2). there are only two prole functions b0, c0, and the only solution is
the standard spherically symmetric bogomolny 1-monopole. the non-bogomolny su(2)
monopole of taubes [7] is not spherically symmetric, it has only an axial symmetry, and
thus does not fall into the class of solutions which we obtain here.

4.2 su(3)

for n = 3 there are four prole functions, b0, b1, c0, c1, and our ansatz (3.6) reduces
the yang-mills-higgs equations to the following set of second order nonlinear ordinary
dierential equations

(bjr2) = 2(2bjc2
r2cj = cj(2c2

j  bkc2
k)
j  c2

k  1 + b2

j r2).

(4.1)

here the indices are chosen from the set {0, 1} and k 6= j. recall that the summation
convention is no longer used in this paper. it is immediately clear that there is a symmetry
under the interchange of indices, 0  1, when applied simultaneously to both the bj and
cj functions; we shall make use of this symmetry later.

the corresponding energy, (2.1), is given by

e = 2z

(b2

0 + b2

0 + c2

1 + c2

1 + b0b1) + c2

1)2) dr.
(4.2)
from this expression it can be seen that the energy is nite providing the functions
approach their asymptotic values at least as fast as 1/r, and if in addition the constraints
that cj()bj() = 0 are imposed for j = 0, 1.

0)2 + (1 c2

1)2 + (c2

1 +

before studying the second order equations (4.1) it is rst useful to examine the rst

order bogomolny equations, which in this formalism become

r2bj = (2c2
cj = cjbj

j  c2

k  1)

(4.3)

where the notation is as above. integrating the last equation gives the asymptotic behaviour
for cj as

cj  exp(rbj() + o(1)).

(4.4)

now since cj must be nite as r   this gives that bj()  0. thus we can characterize
bogomolny monopoles by the fact that the asymptotic values of the bjs are all non-
negative. if we consider the anti-bogomolny equations then they are given by equations
(4.3) but in which the minus signs are removed from the right hand side of the equations.
in this case the requirement that cj() is nite implies that bj()  0. thus we see

7

that bogomolny monopoles have the property that all the asymptotic values of the bjs
have the same sign, positive for monopoles and negative for anti-monopoles.
it is then
natural to look for non-bogomolny solutions of the second order equations in which the
asymptotic values b0() and b1() have opposite sign, and to interpret these as monopole
anti-monopole solutions.

in order to read o the properties of a given solution we need to compute the higgs eld
and magnetic charge matrix at x = (0, 0, ) (which corresponds to the direction z = 0).
explicitly, these are given by

0 =

1
3

diag(2b0 + b1, b0 + b1, b0  2b1)

g0 = diag(2(1  c2

0), 2(c2

0  c2

1), 2(c2

1  1)).

(4.5)

(4.6)

as an example, consider the bogomolny monopole with maximal symmetry breaking and
equal monopole masses given by b0() = b1() = 2. then 0 = diag(2, 0, 2) and
the boundary conditions force that c0() = c1() = 0 so that g0 = diag(2, 0, 2).
comparing with equation (2.5) we see that the magnetic charges are (n1, n2) = (2, 2). for
bogomolny monopoles the solutions can be obtained explicitly and the monopole charges
are understood in terms of the degrees of the harmonic map projectors from which they
are constructed [5]. at rst site it might appear from (4.6) that the magnetic charges are
determined only by the boundary values cj() and are independent of the values of bj().
however, this naive view is incorrect as is easily seen by considering the simple case of the
anti-bogomolny solution with b0() = b1() = 2. again the boundary conditions imply
that c0() = c1() = 0 and hence we obtain the same matrix g0 = diag(2, 0, 2). but
now we must be aware that in this case we have 0 = diag(2, 0, 2) so that the entries are
not correctly ordered from the largest to the smallest. a constant gauge transformation
permutes the entries to obtain 0 = diag(2, 0, 2) but this acts in the same way on the
magnetic charge matrix so that after this gauge transformation we are left with the charge
matrix g0 = diag(2, 0, 2). now that 0 has the correct order we can compare this charge
matrix with equation (2.5) and conclude that (n1, n2) = (2, 2). although this example
of computing the magnetic charges is trivial it illustrates the important point that the
asymptotic values bj() are required in order to determine the magnetic charges. we
shall see more interesting consequences of this fact in what follows.

for the moment we shall consider the case for which bj() 6= 0, so that the boundary
conditions are cj() = 0 for j = 0, 1. the bogomolny equations (4.3) are integrable and
allow explicit solutions to be found for any choice of the positive parameters b0(), b1(),
which give the monopole masses m1, m2. however, it seems unlikely that explicit non-
bogomolny solutions to the second order equations (4.1) can be found in closed form.
therefore we resort to a numerical solution of these equations. we apply a gradient ow
algorithm with a nite dierence scheme to compute the solution with a given set of
boundary values b0(), b1(). for all choices of these parameters we were able to nd a
numerical solution. as a test on the accuracy of the code we computed the charge (2, 2)
bogomolny solution with b0() = b1() = 2. in this case, since the monopole masses are
equal, m1 = m2 = 2, and the total number of monopoles is four then the energy is e = 8.

8

this value of the energy was obtained from our numerical code to within an accuracy of
three decimal places.

in order to consider the non-bogomolny analogue of this solution we want to x the
monopole masses in the same way as m1 = m2 = 2. thus the eigenvalues of 0 must again
be 0 and 2, though this time their order will not be correct. for example, consider the
choice of ordering 0 = diag(0, 2, 2), which by (4.5) corresponds to the boundary values
b0() = 2 and b1() = 4. thus, since b0() and b1() have opposite sign, this gives a
non-bogomolny solution. in figure 1.1 we plot the functions b0, b1, c0, c1 obtained from the
numerical solution in this case. in figure 1.2 we plot the energy density of this solution
(solid line) and the energy density of the corresponding bogomolny solution (dashed line).
note the dip in the energy density at the origin for the non-bogomolny solution, so that
some energy density isosurfaces will be shell-like. we compute the energy of this solution
to be e = 9.0, so that it is larger than the bogomolny solution. as discussed above,
the entries of the magnetic charge matrix must also be permuted (in accordance with the
permutation of the entries in the higgs eld to obtain the correct ordering) and this results
in g0 = diag(0, 2, 2). comparison with (2.5) then gives the charges as (n1, n2) = (0, 2).
clearly the energy of this solution has little to do with the bogomolny bound (2.7), and
it would be nice to understand its value. with this aim in mind we now attempt some
phenomenology to interpret the charge and energy of this monopole.

as mentioned in section 3 the projectors used in the harmonic map ansatz have a sigma
model interpretation in terms of instanton anti-instanton congurations. however, the
bogomolny monopole solutions clearly have no anti-monopoles, so it appears that in this
case the prole functions are such that the monopole does not see any anti-soliton content.
nevertheless, when the prole functions are modied to a non-bogomolny solution some
of the anti-soliton content becomes visible  we have already seen a signature for this in
terms of the signs of the asymptotic values of the prole functions. this suggests that
we should think of the charge (0, 2) solution as the composite (0, 2) = (+2  2, +2  0),
where the plus signs denote monopoles and the minus signs anti-monopoles (the positive
monopole content is taken from the bogomolny solution). with this interpretation the
(0, 2) solution contains two monopoles and two monopole anti-monopole pairs. since the
energy of the solution is e = 9.0 and the monopole mass is 2, this phenomenology gives
an approximate value for the energy of a monopole anti-monopole pair as em m = 2.5.
this value is at least reasonable, since (having normalized the monopole mass to 2) the
energy of a monopole anti-monopole pair should be something less than 4; the precise
value depends on the details of the monopole anti-monopole interaction. some non-trivial
tests of the above interpretation will arise later when we consider su(4) monopoles. note
that although we know that these solutions are not global minima and we expect them
to be unstable (to annihilation of the monopole anti-monopole pairs) we have not proved
that they are unstable. a stability analysis would need to be undertaken to prove that
the solutions are not local minima, though it would be extremely surprising if they were
stable.

in su(3) there are six possible ways to order the eigenvalues of the higgs eld and the
corresponding monopole charges are (2, 2), (0, 2), (2, 0), thus all the other monopole

9

solutions are trivially related to the two examples we have discussed.

2,  1

let us now turn to minimal symmetry breaking, which we may take to be given by
0 = diag(1,  1
2). the bogomolny monopole has boundary values given by b0() = 3
2
and b1() = 0. since the second prole function vanishes at innity then the boundary
conditions now allow that c1() 6= 0. as this is a bogomolny solution then it can be found
explicitly and the appropriate boundary condition turns out to be [5] c1() = 12 , which
gives the charge (2, [1]). here the notation is that magnetic weights are denoted by square
brackets. the monopole masses are m1 = 3

2, m2 = 0, so the energy is e = 3.

recall that the bogomolny solutions have the property that all the bjs at innity have
the same sign, whereas for non-bogomolny solutions this is not the case. thus one may
wonder whether these two types of solution are smoothly connected as the values of (one or
more) bj() are varied to change sign. the answer is that they are not, since this smooth
variation must pass through the point bj() = 0 where (as we see above) the symmetry
breaking pattern changes and the boundary condition on cj() suers a discontinuous
jump.

2 , 1,  1

for bogomolny monopoles a non-maximal symmetry breaking pattern requires the
vanishing of at least one bj(), but for non-bogomolny monopoles this is not the case.
for example, permuting the eigenvalues into the order 0 = diag( 1
2) corresponds
to the choice b0() = b1() =  3
2 and hence the charge (0, [2]). the symmetry of
equations (4.1) together with the symmetry of the boundary conditions in this case force
the reduction c0 = c1 and b0 = b1. the minimally broken su(3) non-bogomolny monopole
that arises from this specic reduction has been obtained previously by burzla [3], using a
hedgehog-like ansatz and a group theoretic approach in which the gauge potential involves
the principle su(2) triplet in su(3) but the higgs eld involves the associated 5-plet.
burzla [3] proved the existence of a solution to the equations which result in this case.
an important feature of the proof is the fact that the equations arise as the variation of
an energy functional and therefore it only remains to show that a minimizer exists, for
which standard methods can be employed.
in our general case we have the variational
formulation which comes from the yang-mills-higgs energy and so it should be possible
to use similar techniques to prove the existence of solutions. in this paper we are content
with numerical solutions of the prole function equations and these are shown in figure
1.3 for this case of charge (0, [2]). in figure 1.4 we plot the energy density for this solution
(solid line) and the energy density of the corresponding bogomolny charge (2, [1]) solution
(dashed line). again note the dip in energy density near the origin of the non-bogomolny
solution. the energy of the non-bogomolny solution is found to be e = 4.3, which should
be compared with the energy e = 3 of the bogomolny solution.

4.3 su(4)

for n = 4 there are six prole functions, bj, cj, j = 0, 1, 2, and the yang-mills-higgs

(4.1)

if we regard the indices on the prole functions as labelling sites on a linear lattice then
we see that the equations involve only a nearest neighbour coupling. also, there is again a
symmetry of reecting the lattice about its midpoint, which in this case is the interchange
0  2.

a consideration of the associated energy shows that the boundary conditions again

maximal symmetry breaking, in which case cj() = 0.

the eigenvalues and charges are given by

0 =

diag(3b0 + 2b1 + b2, 2b1 + b2  b0, b2  b0  2b1, b0  2b1  3b2)

g0 = diag(3(1  c2

0), (1 + 3c2

0  4c2

1), (1 + 3c2

1), 3(1  c2

2)).

(4.3)

normalizing the monopole mass to two, the bogomolny solution with b0() = b1() =
b2() = 2 has 0 = diag(3, 1, 1, 3). from (4.3) this solution has g0 = diag(3, 1, 1, 3)
and hence by comparison with (2.5) the charge is (3, 4, 3), with corresponding energy
e = 20.

there are 24 dierent orderings of the eigenvalues 3, 1 and of these there are 8
which give fundamentally dierent monopoles.
in table 1 we list the values of bj()
and the corresponding magnetic charges. as in the su(3) case, the magnetic charges
are computed by rst nding the permutation required so that 0 has the correct order-
ing, that is, 0 = diag(3, 1, 1, 3), then applying this permutation to the elements of
g0 = diag(3, 1, 1, 3) which can then be compared with the denition (2.5).

table 1 : boundary conditions, charges and energies for su(4) monopoles.

in table 1 we also list the computed energies, e, of the solutions and the approximate

values, ee, calculated using the monopole anti-monopole interpretation discussed in the

11

previous section. thus for example, we write (3, 0, 1) = (3  0, 4  4, 3  2), where the
positive monopole content is taken from the bogomolny solution. the interpretation of this
solution is therefore that it contains six monopole anti-monopole pairs and four monopoles.

the approximate energy is then ee = 4  2 + 6em m = 23, where we have used the result

of the previous section that em m = 2.5. the true energy of this solution is e = 23.3
which is in good agreement with the approximate value. a glance at table 1 reveals that
the approximate energies are in reasonable agreement with the calculated values, which
adds support to our interpretation of the solutions in terms of monopole anti-monopole
congurations. only one case, the charge (3, 0, 1) solution, shows a signicant discrepancy
and it is easy to imagine that the ner details of the arrangement of the monopoles/anti-
monopoles needs to be taken into account to get a better agreement. indeed the surprising
fact is that our naive counting produces results which are remarkably accurate.

we have only discussed the case of maximal symmetry breaking in this section but
solutions for all symmetry breaking patterns can also be found. as an example, the case of
minimal symmetry breaking can be obtained by exploiting the symmetry of the equations
to set b0 = b2, b1 = 0, c0 = c2, c1 = 0. this gives the su(4) analogue of burzlas su(3)
solution, and indeed the equations in the two cases have the same structure.

5 conclusion

in this paper we have presented some static spherically symmetric monopole solu-
tions of the su(n) yang-mills-higgs equations which are not solutions of the bogomolny
equation. some of the properties of these solutions have been calculated and their inter-
pretation in terms of monopole anti-monopole congurations discussed. a crucial tool in
the investigation was the connection with the two-dimensional cipn1 sigma model, and
indeed our solutions may be considered to be the monopole analogues of the sigma model
non-instanton solutions. finally, it is perhaps interesting to note that in the context of
string theory sen [6] has revealed new perspectives on d-branes and other aspects of string
theory by consideration of the dynamics of unstable d-brane anti-d-brane congurations.
in particular d-branes themselves appear as topological defects in the worldvolume of
higher dimensional unstable brane congurations. it remains to be seen whether monopole
anti-monopole solutions have any important role to play in this light, but if so then our
solutions are perhaps the simplest examples upon which any further studies might be based.
