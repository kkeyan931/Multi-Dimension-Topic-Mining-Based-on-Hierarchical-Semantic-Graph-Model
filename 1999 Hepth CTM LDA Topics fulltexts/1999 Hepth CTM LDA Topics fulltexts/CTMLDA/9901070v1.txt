abstract

we describe the investigation of spontaneous mass-generation and
chiral symmetry breaking in supersymmetric qed3 using numerical so-
lutions of the dyson-schwinger equation together with the cjt eective
action and supersymmetric ward identities. we nd that, within the
quenched, bare vertex approximation, the chirally symmetric solution is
favoured.

1 introduction

any realistic attempt to unify gravity with the other fundamental forces of
nature must almost certainly be supersymmetric. whilst perturbative re-
sults are often easier to nd in supersymmetric eld theories than in ordinary
gauge theories, especially with the use of superelds, the development of non-
perturbative tools for supersymmetric theories has not yet reached maturity.
in this paper we apply a nonperturbative tool which has proved to be eec-
tive in the study of strong interactions, namely dyson-schwinger equations
(dses) 1, to one of the simplest supersymmetric gauge theories.

we choose as our gauge theory supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics
in three space-time dimensions (sqed3).
in its nonsupersymmetric form,
three dimensional quantum electrodynamics (qed3) with four component
spinors 2 exhibits the interesting nonperturbative phenomena of connement
and, at least for small numbers of avours, chiral symmetry breaking. much of
what is known about the behaviour of qed3 has been learnt from numerical
dse 3 or lattice 4 calculations. considering the success of dse techniques in
nonsupersymmetric theories, there is a surprising scarcity of applications of
the method to supersymmetric theories in the literature, and an almost total
absence of numerical dse calculations in particular.

the version of sqed3 which we consider is the four-component fermion
version rst proposed by pisarski 2, who approached the model by dimensional
reduction from sqed4. herein, we develop sqed3 using the wess zumino
construction 5. our construction produces supersymmetry multiplets which

1

dier slightly from those of pisarski because of an extra degree of freedom in
the charge conjugation matrix. pisarskis approach was an analytic one based
on a 1/navor expansion. his analysis indicates the existence of a dynamical
mass generating solution in the large navor limit.

koopmans and steringa 6 have analysed sqed3 with 2-component fermions
using dses and claim the critical number nc = 3.24 of avours below which
spontaneous mass generation occurs. this result should be treated with some
caution however as it ignores the possibility of spontaneous parity violation 7
and the generation of a photon mass via a chern-simons term when the num-
ber of two-component fermions is odd. furthermore, there is no indication
whether spontaneous mass generation corresponds to the stable vacuum of the
theory.

the above treatments use a component formalism to study sqed3. by
contrast, clark and love 8 develop dses for sqed4 using a supereld formal-
ism. while more elegant as a mathematical formalism, the supereld approach
has the disadvantage that each dse contains an innite number of terms. this
is dealt with by truncating from the chiral multiplet self energy diagrams con-
taining seagull and higher order n-point vertices. they nd that the eective
mass contains a prefactor which vanishes in feynman gauge and conclude that
there can be no spontaneous mass generation in sqed4.

the work of clark and love has been criticised by kaiser and selipsky 9
on two grounds. firstly they argue that the truncation of seagull diagrams is
too severe as it ignores contributions even at the one-loop level. secondly they
point out that innities arising from infrared divergences which plague the su-
pereld formalism can counter the vanishing prefactor and allow spontaneous
mass generation. these criticisms highlight some of the dangers of attempting
to extract phenomenological consequences of supersymmetric dses by work-
ing solely with the supereld formalism.
in fact, analyses in the literature
of sqcd 10, have generally found the component formalism to be the most
ecient way to proceed.

in this paper we present a rst detailed numerical analysis of the chiral
multiplet dse for a supersymmetric gauge theory. we work with the com-
ponent formalism rather than the supereld formalism to avoid the problems
encountered by clark and love. by choosing to work in three dimensions,
and with the component formalism, we nd that all integrals encountered are
infrared and ultraviolet convergent.

section 2 describes the four-component fermion cliord algebra of qed3
and gives the supersymmetry multiplets. in section 3 we present the sqed3
lagrangian and chiral multiplet propagator dses. we explain how supersym-
metric ward identities can be used to simplify what would otherwise be an

2

arduous problem and present our numerical solutions for quenched sqed3
in the bare vertex approximation. we present both chirally symmetric and
asymmetric solutions and use the cornwall-jackiw-tomboulis (cjt) eective
potential to determine that the massless solution is dynamically favoured.

2 the algebra of sqed3

in 2+1 dimensions there are two inequivalent, irreducible representations of
the cliord algebra, given in terms of 2  2 matrices. these two representa-
tions dier by a minus sign 11, and have the undesirable property that either
one leads to a version of qed3 which is parity non-invariant. to circumvent
this property, it is common to consider a four-component version of qed3
incorporating dirac matrices which are a direct sum of the two inequivalent
representations 2. the dirac matrix algebra we employ here is constructed as
follows 12:

the 4  4 matrices  satisfy {, } = 2 ,  = diag(1, 1, 1) where

 takes the values 0,1 and 2. we take the complete set of 16 matrices

{a} = {i, 4, 5, 45, , 4, 5, 45},

0 = (cid:18) 3 0

0 3(cid:19) , 1,2 = i(cid:18) 1,2

0

0 1,2(cid:19) ,

4 =  4 = (cid:18) 0 i

i 0(cid:19) , 5 =  5 = (cid:18) 0 ii

ii 0 (cid:19) , 45 =  45 = i45,

4 = i4, 5 = i5, 45 = 45.

the matrices i, 4, 5, 45 are the pauli matrices in block form and as such
generate a u (2) algebra. the parity and charge conjugation rules for four-
component dirac spinors are given by

p(x)p 1 = (x0, x1, x2), p (x)p 1 = (x0, x1, x2)1,

cc 1 = c t , c c 1 = t c 1,

where

 = 14eip 45, c = 2eic 45 ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

and (0  p , c < 2). a majorana spinor is one for which  = c t . the
arbitrary phases c and p are important for classifying the bound states in
qed3 12.

we have

5(cid:19) c = rc (cid:18) t

rp = (cid:18)  cos 2p  sin 2p

 sin 2p cos 2p (cid:19) , rc = (cid:18)  cos 2c sin 2c

sin 2c cos 2c (cid:19) .

(2.3)

(2.4)

the rst step in the extension of qed3 to supersymmetry is the construc-

tion of chiral multiplets. a reasonable tentative suggestion is

a = i
b = 5
 = (f + i5g) + i 6 (a + i5b)
f =  6 
g = i5 6 ,

(2.5)

where a, b, f and g are real and  and  are majorana. if the superalgebra is
to hold then the commutator of two of these transformations must obey

[ 1, 2 ]x = 221x,

(2.6)

where x is any component of the multiplet. for the case of a we have

[ 1, 2 ]a = 21a  i251b  (1  2).

now, since  is majorana

12 = 21,

as required, but using equations (2.3) and (2.4)

i152 = 2(5 cos 2c + 4 sin 2c )1,

(2.7)

(2.8)

which does not cancel 251. a similar situation arises if a is replaced by
any other member of the multiplet. to stop this blowing out of terms we could
simply set c = 0. this would be unfortunate though as the angular freedom
c in the matrix c would be lost. as stated earlier, this angle is important
for classifying the bound states in qed3 so we would like to preserve it if
possible to see what eects it has (if any) in the supersymmetric theory. to

this end we dene the rotated dirac matrices. this can be done by making
the substitution

(cid:18) 4
5(cid:19)  (cid:18) p

w (cid:19) = (cid:18) cos c  sin c

sin c cos c (cid:19)(cid:18) 4

5(cid:19) = m (cid:18) 4

5(cid:19) ,

(2.9)

in the cliord algebra. (note that ip w = 45 so the matrices i, p , w , 45
again generate an su (2) algebra.) then

c 1(cid:18) p

w (cid:19) c = (cid:18) t

p
t

w (cid:19) ,

since

m rcm 1 = (cid:18) 1 0

0 1(cid:19) .

(2.10)

(2.11)

the rotated matrices can be used to dene a supersymmetry transformation
consistent with eq. (2.6). in order to do this, all terms except 12 generated
by 12x must be symmetric under interchange of 1, 2, i.e.

2w 1 = 1w 2.

(2.12)

in this sense w is well-behaved but p and 45 are problem matrices because

2(p , 45)1 = 1(p , 45)2.

(2.13)

making the substitution (2.9) gives the 2+1 dimensional chiral multiplet

a = i
b = w 
 = (f + iw g) + i(a + iw b)
f =  6 
g = iw 6 ,

(2.14)

which is the analogue of the standard chiral multiplet in 3 + 1 dimensions.

the relative dierence between the arbitrary phases p and c is xed by
the imposition of supersymmetry. indeed, from equations (2.3) and (2.9) we
have that

1(cid:18) p

w (cid:19)  = m rp m 1(cid:18) p
w (cid:19)

where

m rp m 1 = (cid:18)  cos 2(p + c )  sin 2(p + c )

 sin 2(p + c ) cos 2(p + c ) (cid:19) .

(2.15)

5

if the form of the chiral multiplet transformation eq. (2.14) is to be maintained
under parity transformations, the o-diagonal terms in this matrix must be set
to zero. p must therefore be set to one of

and we choose the former. the cliord algebra to be used is now

p = c ,   c

(2.16)

a = {i, p , w , 45, , p , w , 45}

(2.17)

c = 2eic 45,  = 1p .

with the cliord algebra and chiral multiplets established we now look
for a general multiplet. this is very similar to the standard general multiplet
in 3+1 dimensions except for an extra scalar eld k, which makes up the
bosonic degree of freedom lost when the vector eld is taken from 3+1 to 2+1
dimensions. our general multiplet v is dened by the following elds and
transformations:

c = w 
 = (m + iw n ) + i(a + iw c)  p k
m = (6  + i)
n = iw (6  + i)
a =   i
k = ip 
 = 1
d = iw6 .

which becomes that found by pisarski 2 by dimensional reduction of sqed4
when c is set to zero and the scalar elds are trivially redened.

the chiral limit is dened by taking m  0. in this limit the bare la-
grangian is invariant with respect to a global u (2) symmetry generated by i,
4, 5 and 45. in the non-supersymmetric chiral theory, spontaneous mass
generation leads to a nonperturbative breaking of the chiral generators 4 and
5. here we shall explore the possibility of chiral symmetry breaking in sqed3
by considering the chiral multiplet propagator dses. we shall use wittens
result that supersymmetry remains unbroken 13,2.

figure 1: the dyson-schwinger equation for the electron propagator in sqed3.

the electron propagator dse in sqed3 is more complicated than that in
the non-supersymmetric version since the electron interacts not only with the
photon, but also with the photino, the k and its own superpartners a and b.
the dse for the electron is illustrated in fig.1, where a solid line indicates an
electron propagator, dashed line an a or b propagator, a wavy line a photon
propagator, an alternating dash-and-dot line a k propagator and a wave with
a solid line through it a photino propagator.

the dse for the scalar partners is shown in fig.2. it would appear prima
facie that we have two coupled dses to solve, the second considerably more
complicated than the rst. we are saved from this eort however, by the
existence of supersymmetric ward identities (wi) 14. the supersymmetric wi
relating the scalar two point functions to the electron propagator is

h i = ihaf i  i 6 phaai = ihbgi  i 6 phbbi.

if nonperturbative chiral symmetry breaking is allowed for, the two point func-
tion haf i is potentially non-zero in the chiral limit even though perturbation
theory predicts it should be identically zero.

clearly it suces to solve only the fermion dse to determine the scalar
functions a(p2) and b(p2). to do the calculations we perform a wick rotation
to euclidean space. our euclidean conventions are the same as those set out in
appendix b of reference 12. spacelike momenta satisfy p2 > 0, and the fermion
propagator takes the form s(p)1 = i  pa(p2) + b(p2). we use the chirally
quenched approximation 8 which is known to be compliant with u (1) gauge
invariance, that is, we take the propagators of the photon and its superpartners
to be bare. the class of covariant gauges, for which the photon propagator
is given by d(k) = (  kk/k2) + kk /k4, will be considered. we
also employ the bare vertex or rainbow approximation (q, p) =  for the
electronphoton vertex.

figure 3: the chirally asymmetric solution for the propagator function b(p2) in feynman

we show in gures 3 and 4 both the chirally symmetric and asymmetric
solutions to the massless (m = 0), feynman gauge ( = 1) electron dse of
fig.1. the results are plotted in units with e2 = 1. it is apparent in gure
3 that mass generation is remarkably suppressed and both graphs descend
steeply to the values assumed when there is no dressing. we have tested the
convergence of our numerical iteration procedure by varying the initial guess
for a and b and the ultra-violet cuto. these changes had no signicant eect
on the solution obtained.

the dse is the rst functional derivative with the respect to the electron
propagator of the cjt eective potential 15 and its solutions are therefore
stationary points. to ascertain if the chirally asymmetric solution to the dse
is dynamically favoured we make use of the cjt eective potential which,
when evaluated at a stationary point, is given by 16

between the eective potentials calculated for the chirally asymmetric and
symmetric solutions for a range of values of the gauge parameter . our cal-
culation conrms that the asymmetric solution is dynamically favoured in the
nonsupersymmetric case. for sqed3, however, we nd that chiral symmetry
is not spontaneously broken, at least in the quenched, rainbow approximation.
it is clear from table 1 that the calculated eective potential is dependent
on the gauge parameter . this is an artifact of the rainbow approximation
which, for dressed electron propagators, violates the u (1) ward-takahashi
identity (wti). another useful indicator of gauge symmetry breaking is the

calculated in the asymmetric phase. in figure 5 we plot the chiral condensate
for quenched rainbow sqed3 and qed3. while the calculated condensate for
sqed3 is surprisingly insensitive to the choice of gauge, the condensate for
qed3 is, as expected, strongly gauge dependent.

for qed3 the invariance of the chiral condensate can be considerably
improved by replacing the bare vertex with the minimal ball-chiu vertex
ansatz 18, which is specically designed to respect the u (1) wti and be free
of kinematic singularities. for comparison, the qed3 condensate obtained
in this way in reference 19 is plotted in figure 5. here we attempt a similar
substitution for sqed3. note that the photons supersymmetric partners k
and  are completely invariant under a gauge transformation and their ver-
tices are not directly constrained by the wti. compliance with the wti can
therefore be achieved by replacing the bare photon-fermion vertex with the
minimal ball-chiu ansatz whilst the remaining vertices are kept bare. this
method incurs the penalty of breaking supersymmetry. the resulting chiral
condensate is plotted in figure 5. suprisingly the variation of the condensate
with respect to the gauge parameter was found to be an order of magnitude
greater than in the bare case. we attribute this to the violation of super-
symmetry and conclude that any attempt to improve the vertex must remain
supersymmetric.

4 conclusions

we have used the method of wess and zumino 5 to obtain a lagrangian for
sqed3 with four-component fermions. the lagrangian derived in this way
agrees with that obtained by dimensional reduction 2 except that our form
retains an angular degree of freedom associated with the denition of parity
and charge conjugation in (2 + 1) dimensions 12. this is eected by taking

12

suitable linear combinations of the dirac matrices 4 and 5.
it was found
that supersymmetry constrains the angles p and c associated with parity
and charge conjugation transformations in qed3 12 to be related by p = c
or   c .

the dse of sqed3 was solved numerically in quenched, rainbow approx-
imation after using supersymmetric wis to relate scalar and fermion propa-
gators within the chiral multiplet. application of the cjt eective potential
revealed that the chirally symmetric solution is dynamically preferred, in con-
trast to the situation in qed3. we conclude that chiral symmetry is not
broken in sqed3 in the quenched, rainbow approximation.

although the rainbow approximation violates the u(1) gauge symmetry,
we nd the chiral condensate to be relatively insensitive to the choice of gauge
xing parameter. we believe this to be fortuitous however, since replacing
the bare vertex with an ansatz which respects the u (1) wti but not the
supersymmetric wis produces a chiral condensate which is signicantly gauge
dependent. work on developing a vertex ansatz which respects both the u (1)
gauge and supersymmetric wis is currently in progress.
