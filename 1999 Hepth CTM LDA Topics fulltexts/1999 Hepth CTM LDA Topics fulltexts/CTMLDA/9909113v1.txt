abstract

a procedure for reducing the functional integral of qed to an integral over
bosonic gauge invariant elds is presented. next, a certain averaging method for
this integral, giving a tractable eective quantum eld theory, is proposed. finally,
the currentcurrent propagator and the chiral anomaly are calculated within this
new formulation. these results are part of our programme of analyzing gauge
theories with fermions in terms of local gauge invariants.

1 introduction

this paper is part of our programme of analyzing gauge theories in terms of physical
observables (i.e. gauge invariants). for applications of this programme to non-abelian
higgs models we refer to [1].
in recent years we have applied it to theories of gauge
elds interacting with fermionic matter elds, see [2]  [4]. in [2] we have proved that
the classical dirac-maxwell system can be formulated in a spin-rotation covariant way in
terms of gauge invariant quantities. in [3] we have shown that similar constructions work
on the level of the (formal) functional integral of qed, where fermion elds are treated
as anticommuting (berezian) quantities, and in [4] we have applied our procedure to the
2dimensional schwinger model. as a result we obtained a functional integral completely
reformulated in terms of local gauge invariant quantities, which diers essentially from
the eective functional integral obtained via the faddeev-popov procedure [5].

1

the present paper is a continuation of [3]. it turns out that our general procedure
leads to a complicated, singular functional integral kernel. in order to make this model
tractable, we propose a certain averaging procedure leading to an eective quantum eld
theory. this theory is characterized by a certain number of parameters, which have
to be xed by comparison with experimental data. as an application we discuss  for
the massless case  the currentcurrent propagator and the chiral anomaly within this
formulation. (in principle, the massive case can be also dealt with, using an expansion
in the mass parameter, but this problem will be not addressed in this paper.) a number
of interesting phenomena and results comes out: a bosonization rule, similar to that in
the schwinger model appears naturally. moreover, we get a dynamical mass generation
leading to a massive spin1 eld. physical quantities like the currentcurrent propagator
and the chiral anomaly are given as expectation values with respect to an eective non-
local measure. this measure can be analyzed in terms of a power series expansion in the
coupling constant, which, however, is completely dierent from the ordinary perturbation
expansion. this is due to the fact that the above mentioned mass itself contains the bare
coupling constant. therefore, the formulae obtained suggest that automatically some
resumation of the ordinary perturbation series has taken place.
it is also remarkable
that our formulation leads to a completely new approach to calculate the chiral (adler-
bardeen) anomaly. in lowest order this quantity can be calculated analytically. adjusting
part of our free parameters yields the standard adler-bardeen anomaly with the correct
coecient.

we stress, that our approach circumvents any gauge xing and, therefore, also the
gribov problem [6]. it leads naturally to bosonization and can be viewed as a general
construction scheme for eective quantum eld theories. due to the above remarks, it
seems to be appropriate for the study of nonperturbative aspects. we also mention that
a similar construction is possible for lattice models within the hamiltonian framework.
in this context we have discussed the charge superselection structure of qed [7].

our method applies also to yang-mills theories, see [10], where the functional integral

of one-avour chromodynamics is reduced to an integral over purely bosonic invariants.

2 qed in terms of local gauge invariants

the functional integral of qed is given by

z = z y da d d ei r d4x l[a,,],

l = lgauge + lmat

= 

1
4

f f   ma ab b  imna ab ()b

c dco ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

where f = a   a and da = a + ieaa are the electromagnetic eld
strength and the covariant derivative, respectively. here a, b, ... = 1, 2, 1, 2 denote bispinor

2

indices and , , ... = 0, 1, 2, 3 spacetime indices, ab denotes the hermitean metric in
bispinor space and ()b
c are the dirac matrices. the anticommuting components of the
bispinor eld a, which can be represented by a pair of weyl spinors a = (cid:18) k

 k (cid:19),

generate a grassmannalgebra of pointwise real dimension 8. the representation used for
these quantities can be found in [2] and [3].

in [3] we have proposed a procedure which reduces the functional integral (2.1) to
an integral over gauge invariants. it is based upon the following ideas: first one has to
analyse the algebra of grassmannalgebravalued gauge invariants, which can be built
from the gauge potential a and the anticommuting matter elds a. typically, there
occurs a number of identities between the invariants which, in general, cannot be solved on
the algebraic level. in particular, one nds a relation which expresses the lagrangian, or
the lagrangian multiplied by some nonvanishing element of the above algebra, in terms
of invariants.
in a next step one has to implement this relation under the functional
integral and to reduce the original functional integral measure to a measure in terms of
invariants. for that purpose we make use of the following notion of the distribution on
superspace (see [8] and [9])

(u  u) = z d e2i(uu ) =



xn=0

(1)n

n!

(n)(u)u n.

(2.3)

here u is a cnumber variable and u an element of the grassmannalgebra built from
matter elds  and . from this denition we get immediately

1  z du (u  u).

(2.4)

thus, by inserting identites of the form (2.4) under the functional integral, we introduce
for each grassmannalgebravalued gauge invariant a cnumber variable, which we call
cnumber mate. these mates are by denition gauge invariant. this way we are able to
solve the above-mentioned relations between invariants, leading to a theory reformulated
in terms of gauge invariant elds. for details we refer to [3] and [10].

for qed we start with the following grassmannalgebravalued gauge invariants:

k k,

h := 
b
j 
j 
5

:= im(cid:8)h (cid:0)

:= a ab ()b
:= a ab ()b

kdk + kd

k(cid:1)(cid:9) ,

c c
c (5)c

d d.

(2.5)
(2.6)

(2.7)
(2.8)

here h is a complex scalar eld, whereas b is a real-valued covector eld. j  and j 
5
denote the vector and axialvector current, respectively.

3

we denote the corresponding c-number mates by h, b, j and j

5 , and put v := b
2e |h|2
as well as h = |h|ei . it was shown in [3] that our procedure yields the following functional
integral:

z = z yx

{dv dj dj

5 d|h|2 d k[j, j

observe that the integral kernel k[j, j
5 )(|h|2)},
where d is a dierential operator containing functional derivatives with respect to j, j
5
and |h|, multiplied by singular coecients. a priori, this expression does not make sense.
in order to regularize it, we replace it by a gaussian measure with three free parameters,
j, j 5 and h, which have to be xed by physical requirements later. this way we get:

5 , |h|2] has the form k = d {(j)(j

z = n z yx

where now

(3.13)

it is interesting to note that this regularization can be achieved by a technical trick
similar to that used in the faddeevpopov procedure: one can average the singular kernel

4

(2.10) with a functional depending on three auxiliary elds corresponding to the variables
j, j
5 and |h|. it was shown in [11] that the requirement to obtain the above gaussian
measure after this averaging determines this functional uniquely.

we see that the lagrangian (3.13) does not contain derivatives of the chiral current
 enters the theory as a nondynamical eld. thus, we can carry out the simple

j5
, i.e. j5
gaussian integral over the chiral current, which yields

z = n z yx (cid:8)dv dj d|h|2 d(cid:9) eir d4x l[v,j,|h|,] ,

where the eective lagrangian has taken the form:

l[v, j, |h|, ] =  1

comparing this lagrangian with (3.13) we observe that j5

(3.16)

this is the 4-dimensional analog of the bosonization rule in the 2-dimensional schwinger
model, see [12]. (in [4] we have obtained this rule for the schwinger model using our
approach.)

observe that the eld |h|2 enters (3.15) in a nondynamical way, too. thus, in prin-
ciple, one should integrate it out. this, however, can not be done explicitly. in a rst
approximation, |h|2 could be replaced by a constant. we will come to that point later.

finally, let us write down the generating functional integral of our eective theory

(3.14), (3.15):

z[ , , ] = n z yx

4 the currentcurrent propagator

in this section we want to calculate the currentcurrent propagator < 0|t j(y1) j(y2)|0 >
using the eective theory obtained in the last section. we restrict ourselves to the massless
case, i.e. we put m = 0 in the generating functional integral (3.17).

k[j, |h|] = k[j, |h|] + k[j, |h|] ,

we remark, that the covector eld v has acquired a mass m2

v = je2. thus, in
our eective eld theory, the original gauge potential a has been replaced by a mas-
sive spin1 eld v. now, observe that due to (4.28) the functional derivative with re-
spect to  produces the term jev. therefore, the nonlinear (and nonlocal) term



(cid:16)k[



i  , |h|] k
 [

i  , |h|](cid:17) is eectively of the order e4, and we can treat it as a per-

turbation. performing the functional derivatives in (4.27) with respect to  yields a
complicated nonlocal measure, which in full generality cannot be handled analytically.
limiting ourselves to lowest order we get:

next, observe that the integration over |h| decouples, giving

this way we obtain:

fourier transforming to momentum space leads to the following expression in lowest order:

0 (p) = f < 0|t j(y1) j(y2)|0 >0= (pp   p2) t (p2)
with t (p2) := j
v p2 . this result has the expected lorentz structure. moreover, we obtain
m2
the identity p 
0 (p) = 0, which is nothing but the vector ward identity. thus, in lowest
order of the above dened perturbation series, our result obeys the vector ward identity.
however, a direct comparison with the wellknown perturbation series of qed is not
v = je2 of the spin1 eld v occurring in
possible. this is due to the fact that the mass m2
(4.35) contains the bare coupling constant e. thus, expanding this result around m2
v = 0,
which corresponds to a power expansion in e2, we obtain nonvanishing contributions
to all orders in e2. therefore, formula (4.35) can be interpreted as a resumation of
particular quantum corrections, which results in an eective (dynamical) mass for the
eld v. unfortunately, higher order contributions (in the sense of our expansion) cannot
be calculated analytically.

5 the chiral anomaly

in this section we show that within our approach the correct adler-bardeen anomaly [14]
is obtained in the lowest order approximation discussed in the previous section. again we
restrict ourselves to the massless case.

due to the bosonization rule (3.16) the chiral anomaly < j

due to the explicit dependence of k[j(y), |h(y)|] on |h|, a further exact analytical
treatment of this formula is impossible. but, as outlined in section 3, |h| enters our
eective theory in a nondynamical way and, therefore, in principle it can be averaged
out. in the simplest approximation we replace |h| by its mean value 0. this way we are
led to

observe that we get the correct coecient, see [13], [14], for the chiral anomaly if we

thus, the anomaly can be used to x one of the parameters of our eective theory as
discussed in the introduction.
