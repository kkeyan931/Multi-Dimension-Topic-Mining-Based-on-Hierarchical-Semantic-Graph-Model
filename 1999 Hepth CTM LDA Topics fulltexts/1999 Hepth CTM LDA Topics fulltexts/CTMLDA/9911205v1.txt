abstract

we review physical motivations and possible realizations of string vacua with large

internal volume and/or low string scale and discuss the issue of supersymmetry break-

ing. in particular, we describe the key features of scherk-schwarz deformations in

type i models and conclude by reviewing the phenomenon of brane supersymmetry

breaking: the tadpole conditions of some type-i models require that supersymmetry

be broken at the string scale on a collection of branes, while being exact, to lowest

order, in the bulk and on other branes.

introduction

2

we have long been accustomed to accept that typical string eects, conned to very

high scales, are beyond the reach of conceivable experiments. this state of aairs is directly

implied by the often implicit identication of the scale ms = (1/ls) of string excitations

with the planck scale mp, and has a rather stringent motivation in weakly-coupled heterotic

strings, that have been extensively studied during the last decade [1]. in this case, both

gravitational and gauge eects originate from the sphere topology, and the reduction on

an internal space of volume v gives, in a self-explanatory notation, the four-dimensional

eective action:

sh = z d4x

v
2

h (cid:16) l8

h r + l6

h f 2 + . . .(cid:17)

.

(1.1)

this expression relates the four-dimensional planck mass mp and the four-dimensional

gauge coupling g at the string (unication) scale to the heterotic string coupling h and

to the heterotic string scale mh , according to

mh = g mp ,

h = g

v
l3
h

.

(1.2)

thus, with the gauge coupling at unication determined by the minimal supersymmetric
standard model with the desert hypothesis, g  0.2, one nds mh  1018gev . more-
over, perturbative string descriptions, with h < 1, require internal volumes close to the

string size.1

there are a few motivations, however, to consider string realizations with small string

scale and/or large extra dimensions [2]. these were already suggested by early studies of

heterotic models although, as we have seen, they are outside the perturbative setting. aside

from the obvious phenomenological interest in meeting string eects at low energies, two

main motivations have been associated over the years with large extra dimensions. the

rst was actually suggested by the estimated value of the unication scale mgu t , close

1up to t-dualities, we can always refer to compactication volumes larger than the string size.

3

enough to the string scale to let one wonder whether the two should coincide. taking into

account string threshold corrections [3], that grow linearly with internal radii, one could

try to ascribe the lack of coincidence to a geometric scale a couple or orders of magnitude

below ms, at which new (kaluza-klein) physics would set in. this, however, would require

generically that one of the internal radii be much larger than the others, with the result

of driving the heterotic description toward strong coupling, as can be seen from eq. (1.2).

another motivation comes from supersymmetry breaking, that has long been induced in

heterotic models via a string extension of the scherk-schwarz mechanism [4, 5, 6, 2]. in

field theory, the scherk-schwarz mechanism [4] resorts to global symmetries to allow

for more general mode expansions in the internal space, and can be used, in principle,

to induce supersymmetry breaking at arbitrary scales if bosons and fermions are treated

dierently. in string theory, however, the breaking scale is necessarily o(1/r), where r

is a typical geometric scale of the internal space [6], and similar restrictions are met if the

breaking is induced by magnetic deformations [7]. thus, taken at face value, these results

imply that tev-scale supersymmetry breaking requires tev-scale extra dimensions, with

corresponding, nearly accessible, kaluza-klein towers of excitations [2, 8].

with large extra dimensions, the eective eld theory presents inevitable subtleties.

most notably, at energies close to a geometric scale 1/r related to a (large) extra dimen-

sion, the corresponding kaluza-klein tower starts contributing to renormalizations, and

generically tends to drive the system to strong coupling [9], unless special conditions are

met [2]. for the gauge couplings, this can be avoided if the kaluza-klein towers ll n = 4

multiplets, a condition nicely met in interesting cases of string compactications with no

n = 2 sectors relative to the large compact coordinate [2].

with the advent of string dualities [10], the heterotic string has lost its central role in

the comparison with low-energy physics, while the problem of strong coupling can now be

analyzed in a more quantitative fashion, resorting to (dual) weakly-coupled descriptions

4

provided by other string models.

interestingly, these dual descriptions incorporate the

salient features, already envisaged from the perturbative heterotic corner, that are needed

to grant a smooth behavior across the compactication scale. it is therefore instructive

to explore the strong-coupling problem from the heterotic corner with dierent numbers

of large extra dimensions.

in the next section, we thus present a brief review of the

results of [11], in particular for what concerns type i models, and discuss some issues

raised by this analysis. for a more detailed review, the interested reader may resort to

[12]. our main motivation here is to show how, in several of the resulting cases, the

dual string models are characterized by low string scales, that at times can reach the tev

region, with additional interesting eects related to their towers of higher-spin excitations

[13].

in fact, as will become clear in the following, in any string theory other than the

heterotic, the simple relation (1.2) that xes the string scale in terms of the planck mass

does not hold, and therefore the string tension becomes an arbitrary parameter [14].2 it

can be anywhere below the planck scale, even at a few tev. the main advantage of

having a string tension in the tev region, aside from its obvious experimental interest,

is that it oers an automatic solution to the gauge hierarchy problem, alternative to low-

energy supersymmetry or technicolor [16]. weakly coupled, low-scale strings can be realized

introducing either extra large transverse dimensions felt only by gravitational interactions

or an innitesimal string coupling. in the former case, the quantum gravity scale is also

low, while gauge interactions are conned to lower-dimensional p-branes. in the latter case,

gravitational and string interactions remain suppressed by the four-dimensional planck

mass. there is one exception to this general rule, allowing for large longitudinal dimensions

without a low string scale, when the standard model is embedded in a six-dimensional

xed-point theory described by a tensionless string [11].

the very issue of supersymmetry breaking needs to be reconsidered in low-scale string

2it was recently realized that the heterotic string scale can also be lowered at weak coupling via small

instantons [15].

5

models. with the string scale in the tev region, the original motivation for low-energy

supersymmetry is apparently lost, since in non-supersymmetric string vacua the bulk vac-

uum energy is typically determined by the string scale. while this is a very favorable state

of aairs for the bulk spectrum, in type i models the cosmological constant induced on our

world-brane is actually enhanced by the volume of the transverse space. as a result, it is

typically larger than the string scale, and tends to destabilize the hierarchy that one tries

to enforce.

in section 3 we discuss supersymmetry breaking by compactication in type i strings

[17, 18, 19]. referring to very simple models in nine dimensions, we show how the scherk-

schwarz mechanism allows in this case two distinct possibilities, according to whether the

shifts are parallel or transverse with respect to the resulting branes.

in the latter case,

they are ineective on their massless modes, that display an enhanced supersymmetry.

this is the phenomenon commonly denoted brane supersymmetry, rst noted in [17] and

developed further in [18, 19]. in the last section, referring to a six-dimensional example, we

review how the consistent denition of some type i models requires that, to lowest order,

supersymmetry be broken at the string scale on a collection of branes, while the bulk is

unaected [20]. this phenomenon, we believe, is particularly intriguing. for the rst time,

supersymmetry breaking is not an option, but is required by the very consistency of a class

of string models. the vacuum energy, restricted to the brane from which supersymmetry

breaking originates, is naturally protected against the destabilizing eects of gravitational

radiative corrections, since to lowest order the bulk is supersymmetric. moreover, if our

world is modeled resorting to this framework, the current experimental limits on short-

distance gravitational eects [21] leave open the exciting possibility of an (almost) exact

supergravity a (sub)millimeter away from it.

this is a joint version of the talks presented by the authors at strings 99. trans-

parencies and audio are available at [22].

2. large extra dimensions: the heterotic string and its duals

6

2.1. type i strings and d-branes

in ten dimensions, the strongly coupled so(32) heterotic string is dual to the type i

string3, a theory where gravity is described by unoriented closed strings, while gauge in-

teractions are described by unoriented open strings whose ends are conned to d-branes.

therefore, in this setting some of the six internal compact dimensions are longitudinal

(parallel) and some are transverse to the d-branes. in particular, if the standard model

were localized on a p-brane (with p  3), there would be p  3 longitudinal and 9  p
transverse compact dimensions. in contrast to the heterotic string, here gauge and gravita-

tional interactions appear at dierent orders of perturbation theory, and the corresponding

eective action reads

si = z d10x

i r +z dp+1x

(2.1)

where the factor 1/i in the gauge kinetic terms reects their origin from the disk diagram.

upon compactication to four dimensions, the planck length and the gauge couplings

are given, to leading order, by

(2.2)

where vk (v) denotes the compactication volume longitudinal (transverse) to the p-

brane. the second relation links the weak coupling i < 1 to sizes of the longitudinal
space comparable to the string length (vk  lp3
unrestricted. combining eqs. (2.2) gives

), while the transverse volume v remains

i = g2vk ,

(2.3)

3t-dualities turn this model into the type i string, that in lower dimensions can also describe a class

of m-theory compactications.

7

to be compared with the heterotic relations (1.2). here vk

>
 1 is the longitudinal volume in

string units, and we are considering an isotropic transverse space with n = 9  p compact
dimensions of radius r.

the relations (2.3) imply that the type i/i string scale can be made hierarchically

smaller than the planck mass at the expense of introducing extra large transverse dimen-

sions that interact only gravitationally [16, 23]. the weakness of four-dimensional (4d)

gravity mi/mp may then be attributed to the largeness of the transverse space r/li.

however, the (higher-dimensional) gravity becomes strong at the string scale, although the

string coupling is weak, and indeed the rst of eq.(2.3) can be understood as a consequence

of the (4 + n)-dimensional gauss law for gravity, with

g(4+n)

n

= g4l2+n

i

vk

(2.4)

newtons constant in 4 + n dimensions. taking the type i string scale mi at 1 tev, one

nds a size for the transverse dimensions r varying from 108 km, to .1 mm (103 ev),

and down to .1 fermi (10 mev) for n = 1, 2, or 6 large dimensions. aside from the n = 1

case, obviously excluded, all other cases are actually consistent with observations, although

barely for n = 2 [24]. in particular, sub-millimeter transverse directions are compatible

with the present constraints from short-distance gravity measurements, that have tested

newtons law only down to the cm [21].

2.2. type iia strings

upon compactication to 6 or fewer dimensions, the heterotic string admits another

dual description in terms of the type iia string compactied on a calabi-yau manifold.
for simplicity, we restrict ourselves to compactications on k3  t 2, yielding n = 4 su-
persymmetry, or more generally on calabi-yau manifolds that are k3 brations, yielding

n = 2 supersymmetry.

in contrast to heterotic and type i strings, non-abelian gauge

symmetries in type iia models arise non-perturbatively (at arbitrarily weak coupling) in

8

singular compactications, where the massless gauge bosons are provided by d2-branes

wrapped around (vanishing) non-trivial 2-cycles. the resulting gauge interactions are lo-

calized on k3, while matter multiplets arise from further singularities, and are completely

localized in the 6d internal space. as a result, the gauge kinetic terms are independent of

the string coupling iia, and the corresponding eective action is

siia = z d10x

1
2
iial8

iiar + z d6x

1
l2
iia

f 2 ,

(2.5)

to be compared with (1.1) and (2.1). upon compactication to four dimensions, for instance

on a two-torus t 2, the gauge couplings are determined by its size, vt 2 in string units, while

the planck mass is controlled by the 6d string coupling 6iia:

.

(2.6)

the area of t 2 should therefore be of order l2

iia, while the string scale is now related to

the planck mass according to

miia = g6iiamp = giiamp

l2
iiavk3

,

(2.7)

with vk3 the volume of k3. thus, in contrast to the type i relation (2.3), only sensitive

to the volume of the internal six-manifold, one now has the freedom to use both the string

coupling and the k3 volume to separate the planck mass from a string scale at, say, 1 tev.

in particular, with a string-size internal manifold, an ultra-weak coupling iia = 1014 can

account for the hierarchy between the electroweak and planck scales [11]. in this setting,

despite the fact that the string scale is so low, gravity remains weak up to the planck scale,

while string interactions are suppressed by the tiny string coupling, or equivalently by the

4d planck mass. thus, no observable eects are left for particle accelerators, aside from the

production of kk excitations along the two tev dimensions of t 2 felt by gauge interactions.

furthermore, the excitations of the gauge multiplets have n = 4 supersymmetry, even when
k3t 2 is replaced by a calabi-yau threefold that is a k3 bration, while matter multiplets

are localized on the base (replacing the t 2) and have no kk excitations, like the twisted

9

states of heterotic orbifolds.

2.3. type iib strings

in type iib constructions, gauge symmetries still arise from vanishing 2-cycles of k3, but

take the form of tensionless strings in 6 dimensions, that originate from d3-branes wrapped

on them. only after a further t 2 reduction to four dimensions does this theory reduce to

an ordinary gauge theory, whose coupling now involves the shape (complex structure) ut 2,

rather than the volume vt 2, of the torus. in this case one nds [11]

1
g2 = ut 2

,

1
l2
p

=

vt 2
6iial2
2

iib

,

(2.8)

where, for instance, for a rectangular torus the shape is the ratio of the two radii, ut 2 =

r1/r2. comparing with eq. (2.6), it is clear that the situation in type iib is the same as

in type iia, unless the size of t 2 is much larger than the string length. actually, since t 2

is felt by gauge interactions, its size cannot be larger than the tev1, and thus the type

iib string scale should be much larger than the tev. in particular, for a rectangular torus

of radii r and g2r

m 2

iib = g6iib

mp
r

,

(2.9)

so that the lowest value for the string scale, with a string coupling of order unity and
r  tev1, is 1011 gev [11]. this, as we will see, is precisely the case that describes the
heterotic string with a single tev dimension, and is the only example of a weakly coupled

theory with longitudinal dimensions larger than the string length.

in the energy range

between the kk scale 1/r and the type iib string scale, one has an eective 6d theory

without gravity at a non-trivial superconformal xed point described by tensionless strings,

corresponding to d3-branes wrapped on the vanishing 2-cycles of a singular k3. since the

type iib coupling is of order unity, gravity becomes strong at the type iib string scale, and

the main experimental signatures at tev energies are in this case kaluza-klein excitations,

as in type iia models with tiny string coupling.

2.4. relation with the heterotic string

10

as we mentioned previously, the type i/i and type iia/iib theories provide dual de-

scriptions of the heterotic string at strong coupling. somewhat surprisingly, it turns out

that all tev scale string models that we have discussed can be recovered as dierent strongly

coupled decompactication limits, with only one large scale in addition to the planck-size

heterotic tension. more precisely, let us consider the heterotic string compactied on a

six-torus with k large dimensions of radius r  lh and 6  k string-size dimensions. ap-
plying the standard duality maps [10, 11], it is simple to show that the type i theory with

n transverse dimensions provides a weakly coupled dual description for the heterotic string

only with k = 4, 5, 6 large dimensions, since otherwise the remaining t-dualities needed to

obtain volumes above the resulting string scale lead to strong coupling. k = 4 is described

by n = 2, k = 6 (for the so(32) gauge group) is described by n = 6, while for k = 5 one

nds a type i model with ve large and one extra-large transverse dimensions. the case

k = 4 is particularly interesting: the heterotic string with 4 large dimensions at a tev is

described by a perturbative type i theory with the string scale at a tev and gauge inter-

actions conned to d7-branes with two transverse dimensions of millimeter size, t-dual to

the two string-size heterotic coordinates. on the other hand, the type ii theory provides a

weakly coupled description for k = 1, 2, 3, 4 and k = 6 (for e8  e8). in particular, k = 1
is described by type iib with string tension at intermediate energies, k = 2 is described by

type iia with tension and all compactication radii at a tev and an innitesimal coupling

iia  lh /r, while for k = 3 all four (transverse) k3 directions are extra large.

3. scherk-schwarz deformations in type-i strings

scherk-schwarz deformations can be introduced in type i strings following [5, 6], but

present a few interesting novelties, that may be conveniently exhibited referring to a pair

of 9d models [17]. to this end, we begin by recalling that, for the type iib string, (the

11

fermionic part of) the partition function can be written in the compact form

resorting to the level-one so(8) characters

t = |v8  s8|2

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

a simple modication results in a scherk-schwarz breaking of space-time supersymme-

try. there are actually two inequivalent choices, described by

t1 = zm,2n(v8 v8 + s8 s8) + zm,2n+1(o8 o8 + c8 c8)

 zm+1/2,2n(v8 s8 + s8 v8)  zm+1/2,2n+1(o8 c8 + c8 o8)

(3.6)

and

t2 = z2m,n(v8 v8 + s8 s8) + z2m+1,n(o8 o8 + c8 c8)

 z2m,n+1/2(v8 s8 + s8 v8)  z2m+1,n+1/2(o8 c8 + c8 o8) ,

(3.7)

that may be associated to momentum or winding shifts of the usual fermionic modes (v8 s8

and s8 v8) relatively to the usual bosonic ones (v8 v8 and s8 s8). the two choices are in-

equivalent, since t-duality along the circle interchanges type-iib and type-iia strings [25].

12

both deformed models have tachyon instabilities at the scale of supersymmetry breaking

for the low-lying modes, o(1/r) for the momentum deformation of eq. (3.5) and o(r/)

for the winding deformation of eq. (3.6).

the open descendants [26] are essentially determined by the choice of klein-bottle pro-

jection k [27], while the other amplitudes a and m reect the propagation of closed-string
modes between boundaries and crosscaps. in displaying the amplitudes of [17], we implic-

itly conne our attention to internal radii such that (closed-string) tachyon instabilities are

absent, and choose chan-paton assignments that remove them from the open sectors as

well. we also impose some (inessential) ns-ns tadpoles, in order to bring the resulting

expressions to their simplest forms.

starting from the model of eq. (3.5), corresponding to momentum shifts, the additional

amplitudes are

k1 =

a1 =

( v8zm  s8zm+1/2) ,

m1 = 

2

(3.8)

while the tadpole conditions require that n1+n2 = 32. supersymmetry, broken in the whole
range r > , is recovered asymptotically in the decompactication limit. this vacuum,

rst described in [28], is interesting in its own right, since it describes the type i string at

nite temperature (with wilson lines), but includes a rather conventional open spectrum,

where bosonic and fermionic modes have the usual o(1/r) scherk-schwarz splittings of

eld-theory models.

on the other hand, starting from the model of eq.

(3.6), corresponding to winding

shifts, the additional amplitudes are [17]

k2 =

while the tadpole conditions now require that n1 + n2 = n3 + n4 = 16. supersymmetry is

recovered in the limit of vanishing r, where the whole tower of winding modes present in

the vacuum-channel amplitudes collapses into additional tadpole conditions that eliminate

n2 and n3. this is precisely the phenomenon of [29], spelled out very clearly by these

partition functions. the resulting open sector, described by

(3.10)

has the suggestive gauge group so(16)  so(16), and is rather peculiar. in the limit of
small breaking r, aside from the ultra-massive (o, c) sector, it contains a conventional

(v, s) sector where supersymmetry, exact for the massless modes, is eectively broken at

the string scale for the massive ones by the unpairing of the corresponding chan-paton rep-

resentations. this is the phenomenon of brane supersymmetry that we alluded to in the

introduction [17, 18, 19], here present only for the massless modes. however, as originally

suggested in [18], this setting can be generalized to allow for entire open sectors with exact

supersymmetry, as in [32, 33]. the arguments of [30] can then connect, via a sequence

of duality transformations, the so(16)  so(16) gauge group to the two horava-witten
walls [31] of m-theory, with the end result that this peculiar breaking can be associated to

an 11d scherk-schwarz deformation. we are thus facing a simple perturbative description

of a phenomenon whose origin is non-perturbative on the heterotic side. several general-

izations have been discussed, in six and four dimensions, with partial or total breaking of

supersymmetry [17, 19, 32, 33].

after suitable t-dualities, these results can be put in a very suggestive form: while the

14

conventional scherk-schwarz breaking of t1 results from shifts parallel to a brane, the m-
theory breaking of t2 results from shifts orthogonal to a brane, and is naturally ineective
on its massless modes.

4. brane supersymmetry breaking

the last phenomenon that we would like to review in this talk, brane supersymmetry

breaking [20], provides an answer to an old puzzle in the construction of open-string

models where, in a number of interesting cases, the tadpole conditions have apparently no

consistent solution [34]. the simplest example is provided by the six-dimensional t 4/z2

reduction where, as in [27], the klein-bottle projection is reverted for all twisted states. in

the reversal of the klein-bottle projection for twisted states changes the relative sign of

the crosscap contributions for n and d strings or, equivalently, the relative charge of the

be analyzed in a similar fashion [35].

where the upper signs refer to the standard choice, while the lower ones refer to the reverted

klein bottle of eq. (4.1). in the latter case one is forced to cancel a negative background o5

charge, and this can be achieved introducing antibranes in the vacuum conguration. the

corresponding open sector [20] results from a combination of d9 branes and d5 antibranes,

and involves the n and d charges and their orbifold breakings rn and rd:

supersymmetry is broken on the antibranes, and indeed the amplitudes involve the new

characters q

s and q

c, corresponding to a chirally ipped supercharge, that may be obtained

from eq. (4.2) upon the interchange of s4 and c4, as well as other non-supersymmetric

combinations. the tadpole conditions determine the gauge group [so(16)  so(16)]9 
[usp(16)usp(16)]5, and the 99 spectrum is supersymmetric, with (1,0) vector multiplets
for the so(16)  so(16) gauge group and a hypermultiplet in the (16, 16, 1, 1). on the
other hand, the 55 spectrum is non supersymmetric and, aside from the [usp(16)usp(16)]
gauge vectors, contains quartets of scalars in the (1, 1, 16, 16), right-handed weyl fermions

in the (1, 1, 120, 1) and (1, 1, 1, 120) and left-handed weyl fermions in the (1, 1, 16, 16).

finally, the nd sector, also non supersymmetric, comprises doublets of scalars in the

(16, 1, 1, 16) and in the (1, 16, 16, 1), and additional (symplectic) majorana-weyl fermions

in the (16, 1, 16, 1) and (1, 16, 1, 16). these elds are a peculiar feature of six-dimensional

16

space time, where the fundamental weyl fermion, a pseudoreal spinor of su (4), can be

subjected to a majorana condition if this is supplemented by the conjugation in a pseudoreal

representation. all irreducible gauge and gravitational anomalies cancel in this model, while

the residual anomaly polynomial requires a generalized green-schwarz mechanism [36] with

couplings more general than those found in supersymmetric models.

it should be appreciated that the resulting non-bps conguration of branes and anti-

branes has no tachyonic excitations, while the branes themselves experience no mutual

forces. brane congurations of this type have received some attention lately [37], and form

the basis of earlier constructions of non-supersymmetric type i vacua [38] and of their

tachyon-free reductions [39]. as a result, the contributions to the vacuum energy, local-

ized on the antibranes, come solely from the mobius amplitude. the resulting potential,

determined by uncancelled d5 ns-ns tadpole, is

ve = c

e6
v

= ce10 =

c
g2
ym

,

(4.5)

where 10 is the 10d dilaton, that determines the yang-mills coupling gym on the an-

tibranes, and c is a positive numerical constant. this potential (4.5) is clearly localized

on the antibranes and positive, consistently with the interpretation of this mechanism as

global supersymmetry breaking. one would also expect that, in the limit of vanishing d5

coupling, supersymmetry be recovered, at least from the d9 viewpoint. while not true in

six dimensions, due to the peculiar chirality ip that we have described, the expectation is

actually realized after compactication to four dimensions, with suitable subgroups of the

antibrane gauge group realized as internal symmetries.

several generalizations of this model have been discussed in [20]. some include tachyon-

free combinations of branes and antibranes of the same type, that extend the construction

of [40]. this more general setting has the amusing feature of leading to the eective

stabilization of some geometric moduli, while some of the resulting models, related to

the z3 orientifold of [41], have interesting three-family spectra of potential interest for

17

phenomenology.
