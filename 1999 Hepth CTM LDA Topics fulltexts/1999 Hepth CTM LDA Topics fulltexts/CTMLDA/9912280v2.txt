abstract

a coordinate-free action principle for the n = 2 supersymmetric model of spin
0 and spin 1/2 matter elds interacting via chern-simons higher spin gauge elds
in ads3 is formulated in terms of star-product algebra of two oscillators. although
describing proper relativistic dynamics the action does not contain space-time coor-
dinates. it is given by a supertrace of a forth-order polynomial in the 3d higher spin
superalgebra. the theory admits a free parameter characterizing the inequivalent
vacua associated with the parameter of mass m of the matter elds. for the case
of the massless matter, the model has a form of the noncommutative 2d yang-mills
theory with some innite-dimensional gauge group. the limit m   corresponds
to the su () 2d yang-mills theory.

1 introduction

the pure gauge chern-simons higher spin action in ads3 was constructed in [1]. since the
chern-simons higher spin gauge elds do not propagate, this action does not describe any
nontrivial local dynamics. so far, no attempt to analyze higher spin gauge interactions
of 3d matter elds at the action level has been undertaken. the nonlinear equations of
motion have been constructed however in all orders in interactions for 3d higher-spin-
matter systems in [2] for massless matter and in [3] for an arbitrary mass of the matter
elds. these equations are equivalent to the lagrangian ones at least at the linearized
level but do not have manifestly lagrangian form because of the presence of an innite
set of auxiliary variables. this makes it not straightforward to derive the full nonlinear
lagrangian principle underlying the higher spin dynamics starting from this formulation
of the higher spin equations.

the point is that, in this approach (referred to as unfolded formulation [4]; also see
[5] and references therein) by virtue of introducing an innite set of auxiliary variables
the equations of motion acquire unfolded form of certain zero-curvature equations and
covariant constancy conditions,

d =    ,

dba = i(ti)a

supplemented with some gauge invariant constraints

(1)

(2)

that do not contain spacetime derivatives. here d = dxa 
xa (spacetime base indices
a, b . . . = 0, . . . , d  1 are underlined), (x) = dxai
a(x)ti is a gauge eld of some innite-
dimensional higher spin lie superalgebra l (ti  l), and ba(x) is a set of 0-forms that take
values in the representation space of an appropriate innite-dimensional representation
(ti)b
a of l. note that in order to reformulate a relativistic dynamics in such a form one
has to use an innite-dimensional representation t rich enough to allow ba(x) to contain
dynamical elds along with all their on-mass-shell derivatives (for more detail see [5]).
such a form of the equations of motion is obviously non-lagrangian because the number
of equations exceeds greatly the number of variables. it is likely that to construct the full
non-linear action leading to the equations (1), (2) one has to add more auxiliary elds.
this problem is not yet solved.

since the equations (1) have the form of zero-curvature and covariant constancy condi-
tions, they admit an explicit (local) generic solution. the dynamical content is therefore
hidden in the constraints (2). the role of the equations (2) is that any their solution
describes, at any point of space-time, the complete set of all space-time derivatives of
the dynamical elds, which are allowed to be non-zero by the eld equations (for more
detail see [5]). in this respect the unfolded formulation formulation is analogous to the
coordinate-free approach of penrose [6, 7].

the main observation of this paper is that for the 3d higher spin model [3] it is possi-
ble to build an action that leads to the constraints (2) as its eld equations. this action
principle is formulated not in the usual spacetime but in some auxiliary noncommutative
spinor space that describes the innite-dimensional representation space of ba as an ap-
propriate functional space. remarkably, the constructed action has a form of that of the

2

2-dimensional noncommutative yang-mills theory in this auxiliary space. since the con-
straints (2) encode the full information about the dynamical system under investigation
one can adopt an extreme point of view that the proposed action gives just the right vari-
ational principle for the model. as such, the proposed model provides the rst example
of the full nonlinear action principle for a nontrivial d = 3 model exhibiting higher spin
gauge symmetries.

the paper is organized as follows.

in sect. 2 we collect following [3] some relevant
facts about the nonlinear system of equations for massive matter elds of spin 0 and 1/2
interacting via the chern-simons higher spin gauge potentials in ads3.
in sect. 3 we
nd the action functional for these equations and show that in the massless case it can
be rewritten in a form analogous to the 2d noncommutative yang-mills action with some
innite-dimensional gauge group. in sect. 4 we discuss a generalization of this action to the
case of an arbitrary mass. in sect. 5 we focus on the special cases of the parameter of mass
at which the gauge algebra becomes nite-dimensional, as well as on the quasiclassical
limit. in conclusion we summarize the results and discuss some open problems.

2 3d higher-spin-matter equations of motion

the full nonlinear system of 3d higher-spin-matter equations, which is a particular real-
ization of the equations (1) and (2), is formulated [3] in terms of the generating func-
tions w (z, y; 1,2, k, |x), b(z, y; 1,2, k, |x), and s(z, y; 1,2, k, |x) that depend on the
spacetime coordinates xa (a = 0, 1, 2), auxiliary commuting spinors z, y ( = 1, 2),
[y, y] = [z, z] = [z, y] = 0, a pair of cliord elements {i, j} = 2ij (i = 1, 2) that
commute with all other generating elements, and another pair of cliord-type elements
k and  which have the following properties,

k2 = 1 , 2 = 1 , k + k = 0 , ky = yk , kz = zk , y = y , z = z .

(3)

the spacetime 1-form w = dxawa(z, y; 1,2, k, |x),

wa(z, y; 1,2, k, |x) =

(4)

is the generating function for higher spin gauge elds. b = b(z, y; 1,2, k, |x) is the
generating function for the matter elds.
it admits an analogous expansion with the
component elds identied with the 3d matter elds and all their on-mass-shell non-
trivial derivatives. the eld s(z, y; 1,2, k, |x) is expressed in terms of b modulo gauge
transformations by virtue of the eld equations. as explained in sect. 3 (see also [5]),
s and b can be interpreted as noncommutative connection and eld strength in a two-
dimensional noncommutative ym theory with some innite-dimensional gauge group.

the multispinorial coecients in the expansions like (4) of the functions wa, b, and s
carry standard grassmann parity: they are even (odd) if the number of spinor indices is
even (odd), and are dened to commute with the generating elements z , y , k ,  , 1,2.

3

the generating functions are treated as elements of the associative algebra with the

product law

(f  g)(z, y) =

1

(2)2 z d2ud2v exp(iuv)f (z + u, y + u)g(z  v, y + v)

(5)

for any two functions f (z, y) and g(z, y). (the integration variables u and v are required
to satisfy the commutation relations similar to those of y and z in (3). the spinorial
indices are raised and lowered by the 2  2 symplectic form  according to u = u,
u = u, 12 = 12 = 1.) for generic elements f (z, y; 1,2, k, ) = f (z, y)(1,2, k, )
and g(z, y; 1,2, k, ) = g(z, y)(1,2, k, ) the order of the product factors in the integrand
of (5) is essential as the elements 1 , 2 , k ,  do not commute. due to the sign changes
in (3) we have

(1,2, k, )g(z, y) = g(z, y)(1,2, k, )

(6)

(7)

(8)

with some g. the full product is then dened as

(f  g)(z, y; 1,2, k, ) = (f  g)(z, y) (1,2, k, )(1,2, k, ) .

the product law (5) yields a particular realization of the weyl algebra,

[y, y] = [z, z] = 2i,

[y, z] = 0

([a, b] = a  b  b  a, {a, b} = a  b + b  a).

the generating functions therefore can be treated as elements of the associative algebra

with the product law (5), (7).

the full system of equations of motion for the system of 3d massive spin-0 and spin-1/2

matter interacting via higher spin gauge elds has the form [3]

dw = w  w ,
db = w  b  b  w ,
ds = w  s  s  w ,
s  s = 2i(1 + b) ,
s  b + b  s = 0 ,

(9)
(10)
(11)
(12)
(13)

where w and b are independent of  while s is linear in ,

w (z, y; 1,2, k, |x) = w (z, y; 1,2, k, |x) , b(z, y; 1,2, k, |x) = b(z, y; 1,2, k, |x) ,
(14)
(15)

s(z, y; 1,2, k, |x) = s(z, y; 1,2, k, |x) .

eqs.(9)-(13) are general coordinate invariant (because of using the exterior algebra for-
malism) and invariant under the innitesimal higher spin gauge transformations

w = d  w   +   w ,

b =   b  b   ,

s =   s  s   ,

(16)

where  = (z, y; 1,2, k|x) is an arbitrary gauge parameter.

(17)

where  is a constant parameter,

identied with the inverse radius of ads3.

as shown in [3], the elements s0(z, y) and y(z, y) commute to each other,

and obey the commutation relations of the deformed oscillator algebra [8, 9],

[s0, y] = 0 ,

[y, y] = 2i(1 + k) ,

yk = k y ;

[s0, s0] = 2i(1 + k) ,

s0  k = k  s0 ;

k2 = k  k = 1.

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

these properties guarantee that the substitution of the ansatz (17) into (9) leads to the
ads3 equations (21).

fixation of the vacuum solution (17)-(21) breaks the local symmetry (16) down to
it is generated by a parameter

some global symmetry, the symmetry of the vacuum.
gl(x) obeying the conditions

dgl = [w0 , gl] ,

[gl , s0] = 0 ,

(26)

(27)

which follow from the requirements that w0 = 0 and s0 = 0 (b0 = 0 holds trivially),
i.e. gl belongs to the stability subalgebra of the vacuum solution. the condition (27)
implies that gl belongs to the centralizer subalgebra for the element s0 (19), an innite
dimensional algebra lg spanned by the elements y, k, 1 [3]. the equation (26) xes a
dependence of gl on the space-time coordinates xa in terms of the initial data gl(x0) = 0
gl
at any space-time point x0 (in some neighborhood of x0). lg contains the 3d n2 susy

 , j} with

{y, y} , q(1)

 = y , q(2)

 = yk ,

the fact that these generators form osp(2, 2) is a simple consequence [10] of the properties
of the deformed oscillator algebra (23). thus, the system (9)-(13) possesses n = 2 global
susy for arbitrary . perturbations near the vacuum (17) describe a massive scalar ads3
hypermultiplet interacting via chern-simons type higher spin gauge elds [3]. the values
of mass are related to the parameter  as follows: m2
 = 2(  2)/2 for bosons and
m2

 = 22/2 for fermions.
since eq. (9) and eqs. (10), (11) have, respectively, a form of zero-curvature equation

and covariant constancy conditions they admit a (local) generic solution of the form

w = dg(x)  g1(x), b(x) = g(x)  b  g1(x), s(x) = g(x)  s  g1(x) ,

(30)

where g(z, y; 1,2, k|x) is an arbitrary invertible element, g  g1 = g1  g = 1, while
b(z, y; 1,2, k) and s(z, y; 1,2, k, ) are arbitrary x-independent elements.

plugging these expressions into (12) and (13) one obtains, as a consequence of the

gauge invariance,

s  s = 2i(1 + b) ,
s  b + b  s = 0 .

(31)
(32)

since these equations contain no dependence on the spacetime coordinates the dynamical
system under consideration turns out to be entirely reformulated in terms of the auxil-
iary space of spinor variables, noncommutative spinor space. recall that the role of the
equations (31) and (32) is that any their solution describes, at any point of space-time,
the complete set of all space-time derivatives of the dynamical elds, which are allowed
to be non-zero by the eld equations (for more detail see [5]).

3 coordinate-free action for the massless case and

non-commutative yang-mills theory

the main observation of this paper is that the system of equations (31), (32) admits a
lagrangian formulation with the action of the form

s = str l ,

(33)

where l is some star-product lagrangian function of b and s specied below and str is
the supertrace operation [11] which for the particular star-product (5) has the form [5]

str f (z, y) =

1

(2)2 z d2z d2y exp(izy)f (z, y) .

(34)

6

since the algebra of functions f (z, y; k, , 1,2) is in fact a tensor product of the weyl al-
gebra with some matrix algebra, this denition admits a unique extension to the elements
dependent on k,  and 1,2 with str f = 0 for any f proportional to the rst power of any
of the variables k,  or 1,2.

the dening property of the supertrace (34) that xes it uniquely [9] for the class of

polynomial functions f (z, y; k, , 1,2) is

str (f  g) = (1)(f ) str (g  f ) = (1)(g) str (g  f ) ,

(35)

where (f ) is the parity of f , i.e. f (z, y) = (1)(f )f (z, y). this denition of parity
is in agreement with the standard spin-statistics relationship, so that

str [f, g] = 0

(36)

for any two elements f and g provided that fermions carry an additional grassmann
grading.

the denition (34) works for polynomial elements of the star-product algebra but not

necessarily makes sense beyond this class. for example,

str exp i(zy) =  .

(37)

as a result, the supertrace (34) is not well-dened for the algebra of y (20) because the
integrals in the denition of the supertrace may diverge. this is the only point where the
denition of the action is sensitive to the value of the parameter . in sect. 4 we discuss
the possibility of generalization of (34) to the case of arbitrary . the content of this
section is therefore only applicable to the particular case of  = 0. note that, as shown
in [3], the equations (31), (32) are well-dened for any value of .

the lagrangian leading to the equations (31), (32) has the form

l = is  s  b  2b  b  b .

(38)

the variation of the action (33), (38) w.r.t. b gives rise to (31) while the variation w.r.t.
s gives rise to (32). (it is the property of the supertrace (35) along with the fact that s
carries odd parity that leads to the anticommutator on the left hand side of (32)).

the eld b is auxiliary.

it is expressed in terms of s by virtue of its equation of

motion (31),

b =

i
2

s  s  1 .

(39)

plugging this expression back into (33), (38) we obtain an equivalent second-order
action,

s  =

str (is  s  2)2 .

(40)

4

according to the discussion in sect. 2, this action functional encodes the dynamics of
massless spin-0 and spin-1/2 elds in ads3, interacting via higher spin gauge elds. the
way this dynamics is described by the action (33), (38), (40) is dierent as compared to
the standard eld theoretical language since it does not contain an explicit reference to
the spacetime. nevertheless, according to the general unfolded formulation technics

7

[4, 5] the equations (9)-(11) provide a map to the usual description of the spacetime elds
in terms of appropriate partial dierential equations [2, 3, 5].

remarkably, the action functional (40) admits representation in the form of the two-
dimensional noncommutative yang-mills theory [12, 13] with some innite-dimensional
gauge group. indeed, let us write

s = z  2i

(41)

with the vacuum part s0 = z and dynamical perturbation 2i. plugging (41) into
(40) and using the formula

which is a simple consequence of (5) and (3), one obtains

[z, f ] = 2i

f
z ,

is  s = 2  2i    
z 



z!  2i [, ] .

introducing auxiliary spinor dierentials dz [2],

dz dz = dz dz ,

(42)

(43)

(44)

an exterior dierential dz =  dz 
strength

z and a spinor 1-form  = dz, one denes the eld

the action (40) takes a form

f = dz +    = dzdzf.

(45)

(46)

s  = 8 str(cid:16)f  f (cid:17) .

let us now interpret the elements z as coordinates of a two-dimensional noncommu-
tative spacetime, identifying y, k, , 1,2 with the generating elements of the innite-
dimensional associative algebra h  the universal enveloping algebra of the commutation
relations for y, k, , 1,2 in (3) and (8). the 2-form (45) can be identied with the eld
strength in the noncommutative non-abelian yang-mills theory. the action (46) has a
form reminiscent of the noncommutative non-abelian yang-mills action with the higher
spin gauge algebra h. here the supertrace (34) serves both for the z-integration and
supertrace for the gauge algebra in the sense that it gives rise to the gauge invariant
functional of the noncommutative yang-mills curvatures. there is however some dier-
ence compared to the standard situation due to the fact that the integration measure in
(34) contains the factor exp (i(zy)), thus mixing the coordinate and color degrees
of freedom.

let us note that despite the fact that the weyl algebra with polynomial elements
admits a basis in which the supertrace factorises in the z and y spaces (i.e. with the
star-product algebra of polynomials in z and y interpreted as the tensor product of two
individual algebras of polynomials in z and y) one can hardly use this construction for the
problem under investigation because it admits no meaningful analog of the nonpolynomial
operator exp i(zy) (18) that comes out as a result of solution of the eld equations in our

8

construction. in other words, the same action rewritten in the tensor product basis leads
to the equations of motion that admit no solutions.

another important dierence is that the construction we use is essentially quantum
admitting no quasiclassical (i.e. deformation) interpretation. this is again a consequence
of the relevance of the operator exp i(zy) that has the form exp (ih1(zy)) if one reintro-
duces h 6= 1 into the right hand side of the equations (8). in other words, the system
under investigation admits no classical solution at h  0 (see however sect. 5).

another relevant issue is that the supertrace operation on the weyl algebra diers
from the trace used in the deformation quantization approach. this is a consequence of
the fact that the weyl algebra operates with formal power series while the deformation
quantization technics assumes integrable functions of the space-time variables that tend
to zero at innity.

4 generic 

as shown in [3], the one-parametric family of vacua (17), (19), (20) describes matter
systems with dierent masses parametrized by . the equations of motion (31, 32) are well
dened for any value of . however, to dene the consistent action functional for the case
of general , one should nd an appropriate generalization of the supertrace operation.
in this section we mainly set up the problem rather then solve it explicitly. a possible
interpretation of this analysis is that the functional space describing the uctuations near
the dierent vacua seem to be inequivalent. the theories with dierent values of  are
somewhat reminiscent of dierent topological sectors, like, e.g., instantons in the 4d
yang-mills.

to see what happens, one has to analyze the action perturbatively. plugging the

perturbative expansions s = s0 + s1, b = k + b1 into (38) one nds

l = 2 + i(s1  s0

 + s0  s1

)  b1 + i s1  s1

  k  b1  b1 ,

(47)

where we neglected the terms linear in s1 and b1 that do not contribute to the action
as the vacuum elds satisfy the equations of motion. because of the cancellation of the
exponential factors contained in the vacuum elds (17)-(19) with the exponential factor
in the denition of the supertrace, the bilinear form in the gaussian integral with respect
to the spinorial variables in (34) may degenerate so that the resulting expressions are
not nesessarily well-dened. in particular, after the gaussian integration in the spinorial
integration variables in (34) is completed, some terms, containing the integrals in the
variable t arising from (19), diverge in (47) at t  1. the conclusion is that the naive
extrapolation of the action to the case of arbitrary  is not working.

there are two main alternatives. one is that the vacuum solution should be somehow
modied (as shown in [3] there exists a broad class of the vacuum solutions equivalent at
the level of equations of motion). another alternative is that one should nd a proper
denition of the supertrace operation for every value of . we believe this latter alternative
is most promising. one argument is due to the fact that the on-mass-shell higher spin
algebras and the corresponding supertrace operations are essentially dierent for dierent
values of .

9

indeed, plugging the perturbative expansions into the equations of motion (31), (32)

one gets in the linear approximation

as a result,

s0  b1 = b1  s0 .

b1 = k  c ,

where c takes values in the subalgebra of elements commuting to s0 (19), i.e.

c(z, y; 1,2, k) =

1
n!



xn=0

c1...n(k, 1, 2) y1  . . .  yn ,

(48)

(49)

(50)

where c1...n are totally symmetric multispinors (i.e., we choose the weyl ordering). this
formula is a simple consequence [3] of (22) and of the properties of the elements k, 1 and
2.

the important fact shown in [9] is that the universal enveloping algebra of the com-
mutation relations (23) aq(2, ) (in the notation of [9]) with a generic element of the
form

1
n!

1...n ka y1  . . .  yn ,
f a

(51)

1



f (y, k) =

xa=0

xn=0

where f a
which for the element (51) has the form

1...n are totally symmetric multispinors, admits a unique supertrace operation

str f (y, k) = f 0  f 1 .

(52)

for  = 0, it reduces to the supertrace (34) for z-independent functions.

one way to see that this denition of supertrace cannot be derived from the supertrace

(34) is to observe that the following formal computation

str {k y , y} = 2i str (k + ) = 2i 

(53)

is in contradiction with the dening property of the supertrace (35) requiring the left
hand side to be zero. a more careful analysis shows that this result can be interpreted
as certain anomaly due to divergences for non-polynomial functions under the supertrace
operation (34). (note, that, as expected, str{k y , y} = 0.)

of course, there is no formal contradiction with the uniqueness theorem for the super-
traces (34) and (52) because they were proved for polynomials (or formal power series).
the formulae like (19) drive us away from this class. in [3], it was shown that the star-
product (5) is well-dened for such nonpolynomial functions. this is not true for the
supertrace (34) however.

the question therefore is whether there exists a consistent generalization str of the
supertrace (34) to the whole algebra, such that it reduces to (52) for the functions de-
pending only on y and to (34) at  = 0. one complication is that the polynomials in
s0, y, k, 1,2 do not form a closed algebra as the commutation relations (24) contain
explicitly a nonpolynomial function k = k exp i(zy) for  6= 0. this makes it impossible
to work with the weyl-ordered polynomials in s0 and y as a starting point towards a

10

proper generalization of (34) 1. however, such an ordering prescription is not relevant for
the problem under consideration because the star-product (5) is itself dened via certain
normal ordering [3, 5]. the best we can do at this stage is to conjecture that at  6= 0
there exists some operation str that reduces to (52), when restricted to the subalgebra
of functions of y and k, and to the supertrace operation (34) in the limit   0. in that
case, the models with dierent parameters  admit the action functionals with the same
lagrangian (38) but with str instead of str in the action (33).

let us note that if the corresponding actions exist they may also be well-dened on-
mass-shell what is a priori neither necessary nor guaranteed. note that the dierence
between the o-mass-shell and on-mass-shell setting in our approach is that in the former
case the uctuational parts of the elds are arbitrary (i.e., formal) functions of the spinor
variables y and z, while in the latter case they depend on these variables in a specic way
governed by the eld equations (31) and (32) (e.g., via the dependence on y as in (50)). by
analogy with the standard space-time action formulations one can admit that the action
functional should not necessarily be on-mass-shell nite (for example because of a volume
divergence). nevertheless, the insertion of the solution (49), (50) into the action dened
with str leads to some well-dened functional by virtue of (52) at least at the quadratic
level. note that even at  = 0 the variable b contains via (49) a factor of exp i(zy) on
which the supertrace diverges. fortunately, this factor falls out of the lagrangian (38)
and str l turns out to be well-dened at least in the quadratic approximation in b. it
is an interesting question even for the case of  = 0 whether this is true beyond the
quadratic approximation (i.e., at the interaction level). in fact, the requirement that the
nonlinear action is well-dened on-mass-shell may give a useful criterium for the selection
of appropriate vacuum solutions in connection of the locality problem discussed in [3].

it was shown in [9] that for special values  = 2l + 1 , l  z, the algebra aq(2, ) acquires
innite-dimensional ideals i identied with the null spaces w.r.t. the invariant bilinear
form constructed from the supertrace (52), i.e. str (ab) = 0, a  i, b  aq(2, ). as
a result, all elements that belong to i do not contribute under str and therefore fall
out of the action s = str l. the factor algebra aq(2, 2l + 1)/i2l+1 is isomorphic [9] to
the associative algebra of (2|l| + 1)  (2|l| + 1) matrices treated as supermatrices from
mat(|l|, |l| + 1). the supetrace str (34) for polynomials p (y) amounts for this case to
the usual matrix supertrace.

as a result, in the y sector (i.e., at least for the on-mass-shell action) for the odd
integer values of  the action acquires the form of the supertrace of some forth-order matrix
polynomial. the analysis of the o-mass-shell action requires a better understanding of
the properties of str in s0 sector. one comment is that because of the linear dependence
of the eld s on  (cf.(15)) and nontrivial commutation relations of  with s0, the
analysis in this sector does not amount to the algebraic analysis of aq(2; ) despite the

1for example, one can see the diculty from the formal computation of str {kk  s0, s0

} =
4i str(exp i(zy)  k) that leads to a nite expression for str exp i(zy) by virtue of (52) that is in
contradiction with (37).

fact that the variables s0 form themselves the deformed oscillator algebra (24). as a
result there is no reason to expect any pecularity in the s0 sector for the special values of
. we therefore conclude that for odd integer values of  the action of the model becomes
analogous to the noncommutative version of matrix string theory action [14].

let us make a few comments on the limit    that leads to one more inter-
esting interpretation of the model. as shown in [9], the lie superalgebra constructed
from aq(2, ) via (anti)commutators tends in this limit to the superextension of the lie
algebra of two-dimensional volume preserving dieomorphisms with the even part isomor-
phic to the direct sum of two volume preserving dieomorphism algebras of a sphere s2,
w  su(). choosing odd integer  for the limiting sequence   , one recovers
the approximation of 2d volume-preserving dieomorphism algebra by matrix algebras
discovered by hoppe [15].

the simplest way to see this correspondence is to rewrite the commutation relations

(23) in terms of appropriately rescaled variables as

[y, y] = 2i(1 + k) ,

yk = k y .

(54)

the identication h = 1 leads to the quasiclassical interpretation of the limit   
in terms of two-dimensional sphere phase space. the poisson brackets of s2 coordinates
identied with the symmetric bilinear combinations of oscillators y do not depend on
k and describe so(3) lie algebra, while the role of the k-dependent term in (54) is that
it leads to the unit radius-squared of the sphere s2 given by the appropriately rescaled
quadratic casimir operator of so(3) (for more detail see [9]).

another important point is that, for large , m   where  is the inverse radius of
ads3. therefore m tends to innity in the limit   . in other words, the sector of
matter elds decouples from the spectrum in this limit. in terms of the coordinate-free
formulation developed in this paper this fact manifests itself as follows. the part of the
eld b describing the matter elds is proportional to the generating element 2 which
eectively replaces some of the commutators in the algebra by anticommutators due to
anticommutativity with 1. as a result, the limit    turns out to be ill-dened in
this sector and the only possibility to have  =  is to set the part of b proportional to
2 equal to zero. this conclusion is indeed natural in the context of analysis of [3] where
it was shown that the corresponding relativistic matter elds acquire innite masses in
the limit   . the fact that the large n limit in two-dimensional theory is equivalent
to the limit m   in ads3 for certain matter elds looks quite interesting.

an interesting question is whether the limiting procedure in the s0 sector can be
performed in such a way that the coordinates z would admit interpretation of commuting
coordinates of 2d spacetime in the limit   . this is not obvious because of the
appearance of the terms containing exp i(zy) (e.g. via k in (47)). if nevertheless such
a procedure is possible, the resulting model may provide us with some sort of manifest
realization of the bulk/boundary correspondence [16]. indeed, the original 3d space-time
(bulk) theory containing gravity will be equivalent in the limit    to a 2d ym theory
with an innite-dimensional gauge group.

6 conclusion

the action proposed in this paper for ads3 higher-spin-matter system is very dierent
from the usual eld-theoretical actions since it is formulated in the space of auxiliary
spinor variables rather than in the usual space-time. nevertheless, it reproduces correctly
the dynamics of the 3d system under consideration. an interesting question for the future
is to use this action for quantization of the model.

for special values of the parameter of mass the model acquires a form analogous to
that of the matrix models. it is tempting to speculate that the relationship of our action
with the space-time higher spin actions may be analogous to the relationship between
relativistic m theory and its matrix formulation [17].

note that consistent eld-theoretical higher spin actions in ads4 are known not only
at the free eld level [18] but also to the cubic order in interactions [19]. the full d  4
nonlinear higher spin gauge actions are not yet known however. hopefully, the approach
proposed in this paper will make it possible to construct full nonlinear matrix actions
for the higher spin theories in d  4.

the proposed construction exhibits a number of striking similarities with the current
ideas of the theory of fundamental interactions associated with m theory. the  
 limit is analogous to the su() 2d yang-mills theory thus indicating the formal
connection to matrix string theory [14]. on the other hand,  = 0 case is proved to have
a form of the 2d noncommutative yang-mills with an innite-dimensional gauge group.
an interesting fact is that the large n limit in our model is equivalent to the large mass
limit for certain ads3 matter elds.
