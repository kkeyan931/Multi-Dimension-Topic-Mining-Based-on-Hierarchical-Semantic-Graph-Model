abstract

it is shown that dynamics of d + 2 elements of the (super)dieomorphism group in
one (1+1 for the super) dimension describes the d - dimensional (spinning) massless
relativistic particles. the coordinates of this elements (d + 2 einbeins, d + 2 con-
nections and 1 additional common coordinate of higher dimensionality) play the role
of coordinates, momenta and lagrange multiplier, needed for the manifestly confor-
mal and reparametrization invariant description of the d - dimensional (spinning)
particle in terms of the d + 2 - dimensional spacetime.

1 introduction

as is well known there exist several equivalent formulations of the massless relativis-
tic particles. the second order and rst order formalisms are examples of them. the
essential ingredient of both approaches is einbein - the eld describing one dimen-
sional gravity. one more example is the conformally invariant description [1], which
starts from d + 2 dimensional spacetime. the existence of alternative approaches
always sheds some new light on the nature of the physical system. in particular,
the conformally invariant description from the very beginning considers the particle
coordinates and einbein on the equal footings. for the extended spinning particle
[2]-[8] the analogous description [9] shows that the gravitinos of the corresponding
one dimensional supergravity are on the same footing with coordinates superpartners
as well.

in the present work we consider the natural description of the massless relativistic
particle and n = 1 spinning particle in terms of nonlinear realization of the innite
dimensional dieomorphisms group of the one dimensional space ((1,1) superspace).
we construct the rst order conformally invariant formulation and show that
the spacetime coordinates and one dimensional supergravity elds are realized as
dilatons of one dimensional dieomorphisms group. we consider simultaneously
the dynamics of d + 2 dierent points in the group space, hence they contain the
same number of dilatons. the corresponding (d + 2) components of momentum are
connected with the cristoel symbols. one more parameter of the group having
higher dimension is the same for all (d + 2) points. it plays the role of lagrange
multiplier and eectively reduces the number of spacetime coordinates from d + 2
to d ones.

in the second section of the paper we shortly describe the conformally invariant
approach to relativistic particles and spinning particles. the third section is devoted
to the description of spinless particle in terms of the dieomorphisms group.
in
the fourth and fth sections we construct the reparametrization invariant in the
(1, 1) superspace worldvolume action for n = 1 spinning particle. some further
possibilities of applying the developed formalism are discussed in conclusions.

2 conformally invariant description

in this section for convenience of reader we remind the conformally invariant de-
scription of the relativistic particle [1], n = 1 [1],[9] and extended [9] spinning
particle.

the action for bosonic massless relativistic particle in d - dimensional spacetime
can be written in terms of d +2 coordinates xa, a = 0, 1, . . . d +1, of the spacetime
with the signature
(2.1)

a = ( + + . . . + +

(2.3)

(2.4)

the relation of the action (2.2) with the usual d - dimensional action is established
by solving the equation of motion for the lagrange multiplier 

xaxa  xaxa + 2x+x = 0; a = 0, . . . , d  1; x =

(2.9)

(for n = 1 spinning particle the action was constructed in [1]). here i, i = 1, . . . n,
are grassmann variables which become  - matrices upon quantization. after the
solution of the equations of motion for the lagrange multipliers , i and some
redenitions like (2.6) one can derive the usual d - dimensional action for n -
extended spinning particle in the form of [3], [7].

so, the lagrange multipliers  in pure bosonic case and , i in the case of
extended spinning particle play the crucial role in the conversion of the d + 2
- dimensional actions into d - dimensional ones. nevertheless, their geometrical
meaning as well as the nature of initial d + 2 coordinates xa is unclear. in the next
sections we will show that all this functions of  have an interpretation in terms of
parameters of dieomorphisms groups.

3 geometrical description of the massless particle

consider the auxiliary 1 - dimensional bosonic space with the coordinate s. the
generators of the corresponding dieomorphisms group

form the virasoro algebra without central charge

lm = ism+1 
s

,

[ln, lm] = i(n  m)ln+m.

(3.1)

(3.2)

in what follows we will consider the subalgebra of the algebra (3.2) which is formed
by the regular at the origin generators lm, m  1.

the most natural is the following parametrization of the group element

g = ei l1  eiu (1)l1  eiu (2)l2  eiu (3)l3 . . . eiu l0,

(3.3)

in which all multipliers with the exception of eiu l0,
u  u (0), are ordered by
the dimensionality of the correspondent generators:
[lm] = m. such structure
of the group element simplies the evaluation of the variations u (m) under the
innitesimal left action

(3.4)
m=0 (m)lm1 belongs to the algebra of the dieomorphisms group. the

g = (1 + i)g,

where  = p

transformation laws of the coordinates in (3.3) are [10]

 = ( )  (0) + (1) + (2) 2 + . . . ,
u = ( ),

1
u (1) =  ( )u (1) +
2
u (2) = 2 ( )u (2) +

( ),

...
 ( ).

(3.5)
(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

in general u (n) transforms through  and u (m), m < n. at this stage it is natural
to consider all parameters as the elds in one dimensional space parametrized by
the coordinate  . it means the following active form of the transformations of the
parameters u( ), u (m)( )

u( ) = ( ) u ( ) + ( ),
1
u (1)( ) = ( ) u (1)( )  ( )u (1)( ) +
2
u (2)( ) = ( ) u (2)( )  2 ( )u (2)( ) +

( ),

...
 ( ).

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

one can easily verify that the functions x = eu ( )/2 and  = 3u (2)( ) have
exactly the transformation laws (2.3)-(2.4) with ( ) = . simultaneously u (1)( )
transforms as one dimensional cristoel symbol.

3

the independence of u (2) from u and u (1) means that one can consider more

than one group elements

ga = ei l1  eiu (2)l2  eiu (3)l3 . . . eiu (1)

a l1  eiual0, a = 0, 1 . . . , d + 1,

(3.12)

which have identical values of parameters  and u (m)( ), m  2, and dier in
the values of the parameters u (1)
a  ua. this property is valid when all
of these group elements are transformed with the same innitesimal transformation
parameter ( ).

a and u (0)

in general it is true for any group which admits the parametrization in the form
g = k  h, where h is some subgroup of the group g and k parametrizes the
corresponding coset k = g/h. one can consistently consider the set of group
elements

ga = k  ha

(3.13)

with equal coset element k and dierent elements of subgroup ha. this property
(the equality of the coset elements for all ga ) is invariant with respect to the left
multiplication

ga  g

a = g  ga

with some group element g.

consider the cartans dierential form for each value of the index a

a = g1

a dga = i(1)

a l1 + i(0)

a l0 + i(1)

a l1 + . . . .

(3.14)

(3.15)

all their components ((1)
a , . . .) are invariant with respect to the left
transformation (3.14). the explicit expressions for the components of the  -form
are:

a , (0)

a , (1)

a

= euad,

a = dua  2d u (1)
a ,
a + d (u (1)
a = (du (1)
(1)
a )2  3d u (2))eua, . . . .

(3.16)

(3.17)

(3.18)

the rst of these forms is dierential one-form einbein. the covariant derivatives
(carrying the external index a) calculated with its help are

d a = eua d
d

.

(3.19)

the most interesting is the form (1)

a . the following expression for the action

a(1)

a =

a )2  3u (2)),

4

where a is the signature (2.1), is invariant under the transformation (3.14) and
corresponds to the rst order formalism for the action (2.2).
indeed, after the
integration by parts in the rst term and change of variables

xa = eua( )/2, pa = eua( )/2u (1)

a ,  = 3u (2)( )

it becomes (omitting summation over indices a with signature (2.1))

sf = z d ( xp

this action is invariant under the gauge transformations

after the elimination of pa with the help of its equation of motion pa = xa the
action (3.22) coincides with the action (2.2).

4 n = 1 spinning particle in a superconformal

gauge

to generalize the approach on the spinning particles we rstly consider more simple
example of the n = 1 superconformal algebra (sca)

[lm, ln] = i(m  n)lm+n
m
[lm, gs] = i(
2  s)gm+s
{gr, gs} = 2lr+s.

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

the indices m, n  1 are integer and r, s  1/2 -halnteger. following the
considerations of the previous chapter and [10] we write the group element as

ga = ei l1  eig1/2  ei(3/2)g3/2  eiu (2)l2   

eiag1/2  eiu (1)

a l1  eiual0, a = 0, 1 . . . , d + 1.

(4.4)

last three multipliers in this expression form the subgroup of the whole supercon-
formal group and they consistently can carry external index a, as discussed in the
previous chapter.
all parameters (grassmann -s and commuting u-s) are considered as super-
functions of  and  which parametrize the (1, 1) superspace. the variation of

5

superspace coordinates under the left action of innitesimal superconformal trans-
formation can be written in terms of one bosonic superfunction

to calculate the invariant dierential - forms one should take into account that
grassmann parity of dierential of any variable is opposite to its own grassmann
parity, i.e. d is odd and d is even [11]. the general expression for  -form is

a = g1

a dga = i(1)

where d is the berezin dierential and

dva = d dber(ea

ber(ea

(4.12)

(4.13)

note, that all considered quantities  supervielbein, covariant derivatives and inte-
gration measure, depend on the external index a.

to construct the action for n = 1 spinning particle consider the component (1)
a and 

and express it in terms of the full system of invariant dierential forms

xa = eua/2, a = eua/2u (1)

a , a = eua/2a,

integration by parts in rst term and omitting the index a the action becomes

s =

2 z d d(2dx  id   + 2i  2i3/2  x 2).

(4.17)

the equation of motion for  gives  = idx. making use of this equation
and identity d2

superelds

ponent action for the n = 1 spinning particle (2.9).

it is convenient to write the group element as

the last ve multipliers in this expression form the subgroup and corresponding
parameters a, a, u (1)
a , ua, va carry additional external index a. all parameters
(odd ,  and even u, v ) again are considered as superfunctions of  and  which
parametrize the (1, 1) superspace. the left innitesimal transformation leads to the
reparametrization of superspace coordinates

 = a(, ),  = (, )

and to the following variation of  [10]

one can show that such gauge freedom is enough to choose gauge

(5.13)

(5.14)

(5.18)

as in the case of superconformal algebra, described in the previous section, consider
the component of -forms corresponding to the generator l1

a + da  a + 3/2 + d  3/2 

obviously, the combination 3/2 + d  3/2 should be considered as one in-
dependent eld. the eld v (1) in the action plays the role of lagrange multiplier
which leads to the equation

xa

a  eua+2va  (a  d  a) = 0.

(5.21)

note, that in the superconformal subgroup, generated by (5.10), takes plase more
strong equation for each value of the index a

(a + ia) = 0

the equation (5.21), in contrast, contains the summation over the index a. never-
theless, one can solve the constraint (5.21) and substitute the solution for pa a 
eua+2va  a back into the action (5.20). in the resulting action without loss of any
information one can choose the gauge (5.15). indeed, when we calculate the equa-
tion of motion for  and choose this gauge, they are consequence of the equations
of motion, which follow from the gauge xed action.

one easily can see that the gauge xing reduces the action (5.20) to the action
for n = 1 superconformal group (4.15). so, the action (5.20), which is invariant
under the transformations of the whole dieomorphism group of the (1, 1) superspace
describes the n = 1 spinning particle.

6 conclusions

in the framework of nonlinear realizations of innite - dimensional dieomorphism
groups of one dimensional bosonic space and (1, 1) superspace we have constructed

9

the conformally and reparametrization invariant actions for massless particle and
n = 1 spinning particle in arbitrary dimension d. it is achieved by simultaneous
consideration of several group elements. the parameters of corresponding group
points include simultaneously the coordinates and momenta. the interaction be-
tween coordinates is obliged to parameters with higher dimensions, which are the
same for all considered points on the group space.

it would be interesting to apply the method developed here and in [10] to other
innite dimensional symmetries, such as dieomorphism groups of extended super-
spaces and higher dimensional spaces, w-algebras and so on
