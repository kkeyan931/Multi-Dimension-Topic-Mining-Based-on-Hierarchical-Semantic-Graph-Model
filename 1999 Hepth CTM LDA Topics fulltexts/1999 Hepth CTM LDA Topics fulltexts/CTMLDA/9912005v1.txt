abstract

we show how to calculate the quantum mass correction to (1+1)d solitonic eld theories using
numerical methods. this is essential if we want to nd the corrections to non-integrable models. we
start with a review of the standard derivation of the rst order quantum correction. then, we re-
derive a trace formula which allows us to compute the mass correction mode by mode. specically,
we are interested in the extent to which the lowest modes from both, the soliton and the vacuum,
sectors give the leading contribution. we apply the technique to both the sine-gordon and the
4-kink model. then, we compute all the modes numerically and hence the rst order quantum
contribution to the mass of the sine-gordon and 4 soliton.

1 introduction

we focus on the computation of the mass correction of (1+1)d solitonic theories theoretically and
numerically. we follow rajaramans semi-classical quantisation procedure; another option is via
path integrals  see dashen et al. [4]. specically, we are interested in the use of the normal modes
to compute the mass correction and the extent to which the lowest modes from both, the soliton
and the vacuum, sectors give the leading contribution. we start with a review of the derivation
of the rst order quantum correction. then, we derive the trace formula from rst principles.1
we use this formula to re-compute the mass correction and show that the lowest modes are the
most important ones. then, we calculate the lowest modes numerically and hence the leading
contribution to the mass correction.

we quantise around the minimal-energy static solution st(x) satisfying (2), which could be the
vacuum or the minimal-energy solution in a non-zero topological sector. the semi-classical ex-
pansion states that the quantum eld (t, x) is the classical static eld st(x) plus a quantum
correction eld (t, x),

(t, x) = st(x) + (t, x)

(3)

where  reminds us to treat the function as a quantum object, an operator satisfying, possibly
non-commuting, commutation relations with other operators. we have to substitute (3) into the
hamiltonian

where  is the conjugate momentum of . we have used integration by parts, set the boundary
terms to zero and taylor expanded the potential term in powers of . we split our hamiltonian
into three parts,

h = hclassical + hquantum + hhigherorder,

(6)

where the classical mass/energy can be found by substituting st into (4). we concentrate on the
lowest order quantum energy hquantum. this is justied in the framework of a perturbation theory
where higher order terms are neglected due to their smallness in comparison to the lowest term.
this approximation is justied if the potential is roughly harmonic around the static solution and
n terms depend on the coupling constant  in the form n, for example. if these conditions are
not fullled or a better accuracy is wanted, one can resort to well-known perturbation techniques of
standard quantum mechanics. however, let us emphasise that this would considerably complicate
our task. therefore, barnes et al.s attempts are already signicantly hampered for those multi-
skyrmions whose potential does not have a steep valley i.e. are not suitable for a harmonic oscillator
approximation. this is the case for b = 2, for example.2

our quantum hamiltonian, in the harmonic approximation, has the form

where a2 is an operator. if a2 acts as a number, the hamiltonian has the form of an harmonic
oscillator and we know the quantisation procedure.
in eect, we have to solve the eigenvalue
equation

and this is equivalent to the time-independent schrodinger equation. we have to decompose the
quantum eld  in terms of a complete set of real and orthonormal eigenfunctions. therefore,

a2(t, x) = 2(t, x)

where pn is the conjugate momentum of qn. the hamiltonian is an innite sum of harmonic
oscillators of frequency n. we have reduced our quantum eld theory with an innite number of
degrees of freedom to a pseudo particle quantum mechanics with an innite number of harmonic
oscillators. we are now able to use standard particle quantum mechanics. using the operator
method with heisenbergs commutation relation

we get

[pn, qn] = ih,

h = hxn (cid:18)n +

(13)

(14)

where n is the th energy level of the nth oscillator. naively speaking, we have all the information
we need to calculate the mass correction: the classical mass and the quantum correction to rst
order i.e. the quantum hamiltonian. unfortunately, if we were to calculate the quantum mass in a
specic model, we would quickly realise that the mass is divergent; the innite number of oscillators,
an inherent feature of any quantum eld theory, being the cause of this divergent result. in the
next section, we describe, using the 4 model as our example, how to extract a meaningful quantum
properties from our naive expression.

3 mass quantum correction: derivation

we follow rajaramans procedure. for a very detailed and lucid description, we refer to rajara-
mans book [9, section 5.3]. we have re-done all the calculations by hand and with the use of maple.
further we have expanded on the discussion of some parts, given more details and corrected some
typographical errors.3

where m is the mass of the eld  and  the self-coupling constant. in topological charge sector

st(x) =

(cid:21)

(17)

where a indicates a translational invariance (this will lead to a zero mode). we quantise around
the solutions with the positive sign in front which is the soliton  compared with the negative sign
in front which is the anti-soliton.

the corresponding eigenvalue equation for the vacuum is

the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues are

imposing periodic boundary conditions becomes more tricky. for z  , we can use the asymp-
totic form of q(z)

where (q) is the phase shift of the scattering states from the viewpoint of the schrodinger equation;

q(z)  eiqz(cid:0)2  q2  3iq(cid:1)

the condition imposed by the periodic boundary is

2(cid:19) + (qn) = 2n

and the sum over n becomes an integral over q in the limit where l goes to innity:

using the constraint (30) on n. let us briey note that the zero mode, which we have found, is noth-
ing else but the manifestation that the 1-kink solution is translationally invariant. we can imagine
the innite-dimensional potential space at its minimal-energy location having a 1-dimensional val-
ley along which we can move our solution by varying a without changing the energy of the system.
this zero mode certainly needs to worry us, for our harmonic oscillator approximation assumes
steep valleys in all dimensions. however, this is only problematic if the zero mode is coupled with
another mode and this does not happen in the computation of the mass correction up to rst order.
a proper treatment of zero modes is done with collective coordinates: see rajaraman [9, chapter
8].

we have all the necessary information on the eigenvalues and should naively be able to compute
the mass of the 1-kink up to rst order quantum corrections. using (6) and the eigenvalues of the
1-kink solution, we get an expression for the energy

which includes the nite classical energy, no contribution from the zero mode due to its zero
frequency, a nite contribution from the second discrete mode and a sum over the continuous
modes. unfortunately, if we were to perform the integral over q using (30), we would nd it to be
divergent. this clearly shows that our naive treatment of quantum eld theory is inadequate. to
have a nite answer, there are two modications we have to make.

which is a quadratically divergent integral. thus, even the leading quantum contribution to the
classical vacuum is not nite. however, we can follow the example of newtonian gravity which
denes potential energy as the dierence between two states. it makes physical sense to dene our
naive vacuum energy, even though it is innite, as the lowest of possible energy states in the theory
i.e. to put it equal to zero and hence to subtract it from our naive calculation of the 1-kink energy.

if we perform this integral, we still nd a logarithmic divergence plus a nite contribution. we
need to cancel the divergence with another term. we need to look closer at the innities produced
by the innite degrees of freedom of a eld theory.

3.2 normal-ordering and counter-terms

we have to normal-order the hamiltonian and introduce counter-terms. we do not give a full
introduction to all these more complicated ideas and refer to ryder [10], for example, for a detailed
introduction. we decompose the eld  in terms of a complete set of orthonormal eigenfunctions
of the vacuum uctuations

(t, x) =xn (cid:20) eint

2n

ann(x) +

eint
2n

ann(x)(cid:21)

(43)

where a is the annihilation and a the creation operator (we neglect theon them). the hamiltonian
(7) becomes

2 h =xn

n(cid:0)anan + anan(cid:1) =xn

n(cid:0)2anan + 1(cid:1)

(44)

using the orthonormality relations of  and the commutation relation between an and an. the term
anan is viewed as the number operator nn and gives the number of nth oscillators that are excited.

we see that the sumpn 1 is divergent and the common procedure is to re-dene the hamiltonian.

we are free to choose the zero of energy and are allowed to neglect the 1. phrased dierently,
we normal-order the hamiltonian by writing all annihilation operators to the right of all creation
operators. thus, we get

where ,  and  are constants. we write the normal-ordered hamiltonian as our non-ordered
hamiltonian plus two counter-terms that arise from the relations (46)

(47)

where m is the mass correction to the eld and can be evaluated using the one-loop feynman
diagram. the constant  is not of any importance, because it will cancel itself out due to its
presence in both, the vacuum and the 1-kink, hamiltonian. the additional term to ef inite and the
divergent term (42) come from subtracting the counter-term of the vacuum from the counter-term
of the 1-kink and we get

m2

(48)

we evaluate m2 by using the equivalent expression in 4 theory. we refer to ryder [10, section
6.4] for a detailed discussion. the standard formula (ryder: eq 6.95) in perturbation theory for
the 4 model is

m2 =

1
2

igf (0)

(49)

where g is the coupling and f (0) the free particle propagator of a loop diagram i.e f (x  x).
we have to be careful when adapting the result to our case. three modications to 4 (ryder eq
6.65) are necessary:

 g/4! = /4 and g = 6.
 the theory should be in (1+1) dimensions.
 there is only one vacuum. the vacuum eigenvalues are k2 + m2 and those of our 4 kink

theory are k2 + 2m2. therefore, we need to change the mass m2 to 2m2.

the (1+1) dimensional free particle loop propagator (ryder: eq 6.14) with modied mass 2m2 has
the form

where we have a pole at k2 = 2m2 and the two-vector k equals (e,k). we evaluate the double

where we have written ef inite out explicitly. the rst term is just the total energy of the classical
1-kink solution. note that the presence of 1/ indicates the non-perturbative nature of the solution.
to zeroth order in  and rst order in h, we have the rst quantum correction. it is only valid in the
weak-coupling limit. the next term of the quantum correction would be of order h2. rajaraman
[9, section 5.4-5.6] gives a detailed interpretation of the result and also explains why the eect of
the counter-terms on the kink solution and the zero mode are eects of order .

this concludes our derivation of the quantum mass. in the next section, we show that it is
possible to get a formula for the mass correction which allows us to quantify the contribution of
the dierent modes and compute the mass correction numerically by using numerically computed
lowest eigenmodes.

4 trace formula: derivation

the trace formula has been rst published by cahill et al. [3], but an explicit derivation has not
been given in their paper. we derive the formula in this section6. we start by writing out the
hamiltonian (7)

2 h(t, x) = 2(t, x) + (t, x)a2(t, x)

and the equation of motion of the normal modes is

with the eigenvalue equation

(t, x) = 2(t, x)

(55)

(56)

(58)

(59)

a2 i(x) = 2

(57)
where we ignore the  on the quantum eld. a2 depends on the static solution around which we
expand. we label a2
k the operator for the kink. we expand
the quantum uctuation (t, x) in terms of the normal modes of the vacuum, which we label k(t, x),
and the 1-kink, which we label v (t, x). in terms of the plane waves of the mesons with eigenvalue
k,

v the operator for the vacuum and a2

i i(x)

and, in terms of the normal modes of the 1-kink with eigenvalue n,

where the plane waves exp(ikx) and the normal modes n are orthonormal eigenfunctions. the
next step involves writing the annihilation and creation operators of the eigenmodes in terms of
the creation and annihilation operators of the planes waves. by denition,

k(t, x) = v (t, x)
k(t, x) = v (t, x).

orthonormal set (10) and solve the set of two equations for an and an. we obtain

where we have set h to one. finally, we nd that the zero mode contributes 81.5% and the second
discrete mode 6%, thus in total 87.5%, to the total mass correction.

we are also interested to what value of k the normal modes of the vacuum uctuations have to
go to give a reliable answer to the mass correction. intuitively, the zero and second discrete mode
are localised and its norm with the long wavelength vacuum modes should become very small. we
have put a cut-o  on our integral i0 and 1
4 i1 and evaluated the integrals as a function of the
cut-o. we have done this numerically with maple. figure 1 shows that we only need to go up to
a cut-o of around q = 5 for the zero mode and of around q = 15 for the second discrete mode.
(k

 q) this is good news, for we can ignore long wavelength vacuum modes.

5.2 sine-gordon model

we do the same for the sine-gordon model. there is only one discrete mode, the zero mode of
translation: see section 4 and [7]. the normalised zero mode has the form

(78)

with eigenvalue k,0 = 0. the eigenmodes of the vacuum uctuations are the same as before, but
the eigenvalues change to v,k = k2 + m2. the mass correction takes the form

again, we are interested to what value of k the normal modes of the vacuum uctuations have
to go to give a reliable answer to the mass correction. we have put a cut-o  on the integral
and evaluated the integral as a function of the cut-o. we have done this numerically with maple.
figure 2 shows that we only need to go up to a cut-o of around q = 5 for the zero mode. we do
not need to include long wavelengths vacuum modes.

6 trace formula: numerical result

in the last section, we have applied the trace formula to the 4 kink and the sine-gordon model. the
results are clear-cut. the contribution from the discrete modes to the quantum mass correction
is dominant (more than 80%). further, we do not need to probe our discrete modes for long
wavelength of the vacuum mode. this is good news for numerical methods and we can limit
ourselves to the lowest normal modes of uctuations in both the vacuum and the kink sector.
moreover, in (1+1) dimension, we are not restricted by memory or computational needs and can
include all the vacuum and kink modes.

figure 3: the 4 kink eigenmodes from zero to three

for the sine-gordon model.
in numerical techniques, we describe three dierent methods that
solve the discrete eigenvalue problem. the trivial matrix diagonalisation is the more accurate and
simplest one. however, we have to admit that the computational time grows as the cube of the
number of points and the technique cannot be used in two or more dimensions. we substitute the
value of the numerically minimised eld8 into the discretised eigenvalue equation and diagonalise
the resulting matrix with periodic boundary conditions.

figure 3 shows the rst four normal modes of the 4 kink. the numerical eigenvalues are
5.78 108, 1.49998, 2 and 2.03072 compared to the exact eigenvalues 0 (zero mode), 1.5 (rst
mode) and 2 (start of continuous modes). figure 4 shows the rst four normal modes of the sine-
gordon soliton. the numerical eigenvalues are 5.12 108, 1.00682, 1.00682 and 1.06128 compared
to the exact eigenvalues 0 (zero mode) and 1 (start of continuous modes).

6.2 results

we have all the information needed to compute the mass correction. the trace formula has the
form

which is similar to (68). k,n(xi) refers to the nth eigenmode of the kink, v,k(xi) refers to the kth
eigenmode of the vacuum and xi to the position of the ith lattice point.

we start with the 4 kink. we sum up the contributions to the mass correction, mode by
mode. figure 5 shows that the mass correction approaches an asymptotic limit. the rst few
mode contributions are the most important ones. we only include mode contributions up to mode

mode and the nth vacuum mode. for the lowest kink mode contribution, only the lowest vacuum
modes are important. for the highest kink mode contributions, only the highest vacuum modes
are important. the discrete mode corrections are

m0 = 0.384626

mode is an odd function and some of the vacuum modes are even functions. the discrete mode i.e.
zero mode correction of the sine-gordon kink is

7 conclusion

we have shown that the trace formula works very well in (1+1) dimensions for the sine-gordon
and the 4 kink model. the numerical quantum mass correction is very close to the exact one. our
technique can be applied with ease to any (1+1) dimensional theory. this allows us to calculate
the mass correction to non-integrable solitonic systems, for example. specically, we are interested
in the sine-skyrme model [8] and plan to study the mass correction numerically. or, we can look
at the mass correction of multi-solitons, for example.

there are two drawbacks. we have used a brute force matrix diagonalisation to nd the eigen-
values.
it works very well and is reasonably fast in (1+1) dimensions. however, if you are to
implement the trace formula in higher dimensions, you will have to use a dierent technique.
barnes and turok in [2] have used a diusion equation method; as discussed in the chapter on
numerical methods. they compute the zero mode, then project it out of the initial conguration,
get the next mode and so on. only the rst modes are accurate, because the errors are summing
up. computational restrictions also limit the calculations to the rst few modes.
