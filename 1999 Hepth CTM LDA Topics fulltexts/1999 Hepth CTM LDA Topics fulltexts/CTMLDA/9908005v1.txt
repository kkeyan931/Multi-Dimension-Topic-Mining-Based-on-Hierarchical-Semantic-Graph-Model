abstract. we give a pedagogical introduction to certain aspects of supersymmet-
ric eld theories in anti-de sitter space. among them are the presence of masslike
terms in massless wave equations, irreducible unitary representations and the phe-
nomenon of multiplet shortening. [thu-99/21; hep-th/yymmddd]

1 introduction

recently the study of eld theory in anti-de sitter space has received new
impetus by the observation that the near-horizon geometry of black branes,
which usually involves anti-de sitter space as a factor, is related to a eld
theory associated with the massless modes of open strings that are attached to
a certain number n of parallel dirichlet branes, separated by small distances
[1]. in certain cases there thus exists a connection between superconformal
eld theories in at space, living on the boundary of an anti-de sitter space-
time, and gauged supergravity. the most striking example is that of n = 4
supersymmetric yang-mills theory in four space-time dimensions with gauge
group u(n), and iib supergravity or superstring theory compactied on the
ve-dimensional sphere.

in these lectures we intend to give a pedagogical introduction to eld
theories and supersymmetry in anti-de sitter space. the subject is not new.
already in the thirties dirac considered wave equations that are invariant
under the anti-de sitter group [2]. later, in 1963, he discovered the remark-
able representation which is now known as the singleton [3]. shortly after-
wards there was a series of papers by fronsdal and collaborators discussing
the representations of the anti-de sitter group [4]. quantum eld theory in
anti-de sitter space was studied, for instance in [5,6]. many new developments
were inspired by the discovery that gauged supergravity theories have ground
states corresponding to anti-de sitter spacetimes [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16].
this led to a study of the stability of these ground states with respect to
uctuations of the scalar elds [17] as well as to an extended discussion of
supermultiplets in anti-de sitter space [17,18,19,20,21,22].

in these notes we will be able to cover only a few of these topics. we re-
strict ourselves to an introduction to supersymmetry in anti-de sitter space
and discuss the presence of the so-called masslike terms in wave equations for
various elds in anti-de sitter space. then we will analyze the various irre-
ducible representations of the anti-de sitter isometry group, using a variety

2

of techniques, and at the end we will consider the consequences for supermul-
tiplets. we emphasize the issue of multiplet shortening for both multiplets of
given spin and for supermultiplets.

2 supersymmetry and anti-de sitter space

let us start with simple supergravity in an unspecied number of space-
time dimensions. two important terms in any supergravity lagrangian are
the einstein lagrangian of general relativity and the rarita-schwinger la-
grangian for the gravitino eld(s),

(1)

(2)

where the covariant derivative on a spinor  reads

2 e r()  1
l =  1
d() =(cid:0)  1

2 e   d() +  ,
ab ab(cid:1)  ,

4 

ab is the spin-connection eld dened such that the torsion tensor (or a
and 
supercovariant version thereof) vanishes. the action corresponding the above
lagrangian is locally supersymmetric up to terms cubic in the gravitino eld.
the supersymmetry transformations contain the terms,

e

a = 1

2   a ,

 = d() .

(3)

extending this lagrangian to a fully supersymmetric one is not always pos-
sible. it may require additional elds and only when the dimension of space-
time is less than twelve does one know solutions for interacting theories.

let us now include a cosmological term into the above lagrangian as well

as a suitably chosen masslike term for the gravitino eld,

2 e r()  1
l =  1
4 g(d  2)e   + 1
+ 1

2 e   d()

2 g2(d  1)(d  2) e +  .

(4)

as it turns out the corresponding action is still locally supersymmetric, up
to terms that are cubic in the gravitino eld, provided that we introduce an
extra term to the transformation rules,

e

a = 1

2   a ,

 =(cid:0)d() + 1

2 g(cid:1)  .

this demonstrates that, a priori, supersymmetry does not forbid a cosmo-
logical term, but it must be of denite sign (at least, if the ground state is to
preserve supersymmetry). for a discussion see [23,24] and references therein.
again, to construct a fully supersymmetric eld theory is dicult and in
this case there are even stronger restrictions on the number of space-time di-
mensions than in the case without a cosmological term. the lagrangian (4)
was rst written down in [25] in four space-time dimensions and the correct
interpretation of the masslike term was given in [26].

(5)

the einstein equation corresponding to (4) reads (suppressing the grav-

anti-de sitter supersymmetry

itino eld),
r  1

2 g r + 1

2 g2(d  1)(d  2) g = 0 ,

which implies,

r = g2(d  1) g ,

r = g2d(d  1) .

(6)

(7)

hence we are dealing with a d-dimensional einstein space. the maximally
symmetric solution of this equation is an anti-de sitter space, whose riemann
curvature equals

r

ab = 2g2 e

[a e

b] .

(8)

this solution leaves all the supersymmetries intact just as at minkowski
space does. one can verify this directly by considering the supersymmetry
variation of the gravitino eld and by requiring that it vanishes in the bosonic
background. this happens for spinors (x) satisfying

(cid:0)d() + 1

2 g(cid:1)  = 0 .

spinors satisfying this equation are called killing spinors. consequently also
(d() + 1
2 g) must vanish. antisymmetrizing this expres-
sion in  and  then yields the integrability condition

2 g)(d() + 1

(9)

(10)

(cid:16)  1

4 r

ab ab + 1

2 g2 (cid:17) = 0 ,

which is precisely satised in anti-de sitter space.

because anti-de sitter space is maximally symmetric, it has 1

2 d(d + 1)
isometries which constitute the group so(d  1, 2). as we have just seen,
anti-de sitter space is consistent with supersymmetry. this is just as for
at minkowski space, which has the same number of isometries but now
corresponding to the poincare group, and which is also consistent with su-
persymmetry. the two cases are clearly related since at space is obtained
in the limit g  0. the algebra of the combined bosonic and fermionic sym-
metries will be called the anti-de sitter superalgebra. note again that the
above derivation is based on an incomplete theory and in general one will
need to introduce additional elds. the structure of the anti-de sitter alge-
bra changes drastically for dimensions d > 7 (see [27] and references cited
therein). for d  7 the bosonic subalgebra coincides with the anti-de sitter
algebra. there are n -extended versions, where we introduce n supersymme-
try generators, each transforming as a spinor under the anti-de sitter group.
these n generators transform under a compact group, whose generators ap-
pear in the {q, q} anticommutator. for d > 7 the bosonic subalgebra can
no longer be restricted to the anti-de sitter algebra and the algebra corre-
sponding to a compact group, but one needs extra bosonic generators that
transform as high-rank antisymmetric tensors under the lorentz group. in

4

bernard de wit and ivan herger

contrast to this, there exists an (n -extended) super-poincare algebra associ-
ated with at minkowski space of any dimension, whose bosonic generators
correspond to the poincare group, possibly augmented with the generators
of a compact group associated with rotations of the supercharges.

it is possible to describe anti-de sitter space as a hypersurface embedded
into a (d + 1)-dimensional embedding space. denoting the extra coordinate
of the embedding space by y , so that we have coordinates y a with a =
, 0, 1, 2, . . . , d  1, this hypersurface is dened by
 (y )2  (y 0)2 + y 2 = ab y ay b = g2 .

(11)

obviously, the hypersurface is invariant under linear transformations that
leave the metric ab = diag (,, +, +, . . . , +) invariant. these transforma-
tions constitute the group so(d 1, 2). the 1
2 d(d + 1) generators denoted by
mab act on the embedding coordinates by

mab = ya


y b  yb


y a ,

(12)

where we lower and raise indices by contracting with ab and its inverse
ab. it is now easy to evaluate the commutation relations for the mab,

[mab, mcd] = bc mad  ac mbd  bd mac + ad mbc .

(13)

anti-de sitter space is a homogeneous space, which means that any two points
on it can be related via an isometry. it has the topology of s1 [time]  rd1.
when unwrapping s1 one nds the universal covering space denoted by cads,
which has the topology of rd. there are many ways to coordinatize anti-de
sitter space but we will try to avoid using specic coordinates.

on spinors, the anti-de sitter algebra can be realized by the following

combination of gamma matrices,

mab = 1

2 ab =( 1

2 ab for a, b = a, b ,
1
2 a for a =  , b = a

(14)

with a, b = 0, 1, . . . , d  1. our gamma matrices satisfy the cliord property
{ a ,  b} = 2 ab 1, where ab = diag (, +, . . . , +).
the commutator of two supersymmetry transformations yields an in-
nitesimal general-coordinate transformation and a tangent-space lorentz
transformation. for example, we obtain for the vielbein,

[1, 2] e

a = 1

2 2  a 1  1
2 2  a1) + 1

= d( 1

2 1  a 2

2 g (2  ab1) eb .

(15)

again we remind the reader of the fact that we are dealing with an incomplete
theory. for a complete theory the above result should hold uniformly on all
the elds (possibly modulo eld equations). as before we have ignored terms

anti-de sitter supersymmetry

5

proportional to the gravitino eld. in the anti-de sitter background the viel-
bein is left invariant by the combination of symmetries on the right-hand side.
consequently the metric is invariant under these coordinate transformations
and we have the so-called killing equation,

g = d + d = 0 ,

(16)

where  = 1
2 2 1 is a killing vector and where 1,2 are killing spinors.
since d = 1
2 g2 1, the right-hand side of (15) vanishes for this choice
of supersymmetry parameters, and  satises the killing equation (16). as
for all killing vectors, higher derivatives can be decomposed into the killing
vector and its rst derivative, e.g. d(g 21) = g2 g[]. the killing
vector can be decomposed into the 1
2 d(d + 1) killing vectors of the anti-de
sitter space.

for later use we record the anti-de sitter superalgebra, which in addition

to (13) contains the (anti-)commutation relations,

{q, q} =  1
[mab, q] = 1

2 (ab) m ab ,

2 ( q ab) .

(17)

as we alluded to earlier this algebra changes its form when considering n
supersymmetry generators, which rotate under the action of a compact group.
the generators of this group will then also appear on the right-hand side of
the {q, q} anticommutator. beyond d = 7 there are extra bosonic charges
associated with higher-rank lorentz tensors. however, in these lectures, we
will mainly be dealing with the case n = 1 and we will always assume that
d  7.

3 anti-de sitter supersymmetry and masslike terms

in at minkowski space we know that all elds belonging to a supermultiplet
are subject to eld equations with the same mass. this must be so because
the momentum operators commute with the supersymmetry charges, so that
p 2 is a casimir operator. for supermultiplets in anti-de sitter space this is
not longer the case, so that masslike terms will not necessarily be the same
for dierent elds belonging to the same multiplet. this phenomenon will be
illustrated below in a specic example, namely a chiral supermultiplet in four
spacetime dimensions. further clarication will be given later in sections 4
and 7.

a chiral supermultiplet in four spacetime dimensions consists of a scalar
eld a, a pseudoscalar eld b and a majorana spinor eld . in anti-de sitter
space the supersymmetry transformations of the elds are proportional to a
spinor parameter (x), which is a killing spinor in the anti-de sitter space, i.e.
(x) must satisfy the killing spinor equation (9). we allow for two constants

6

bernard de wit and ivan herger

a and b in the supersymmetry transformations, which we parametrize as
follows,

4  ,

a = 1
 = d/ (a + i5b)  (a a + ib 5b) .

4 i5 ,

b = 1

(18)

the coecient of the rst term in  has been chosen such as to ensure that
[1, 2] yields the correct coordinate transformation d on the elds a and
b. to determine the constants a and b and the eld equations of the chiral
multiplet, we consider the closure of the supersymmetry algebra on the spinor
eld. after some fierz reordering we nd

[1, 2] = d + 1

16 (a b) 2ab1 ab 1

2 [d/  + 1

2 (a+ b)] . (19)

we point out that derivatives acting on (x) occur in this calculation at an
intermediate stage and should not be suppressed in view of (9). however, they
produce terms proportional to g which turn out to cancel in the above com-
mutator. now we note that the right-hand side should constitute a coordinate
transformation and a lorentz transformation, possibly up to a eld equation.
obviously, the coordinate transformation coincides with (15) but the correct
lorentz transformation is only reproduced provided that a  b = 2g. if we
now denote the mass of the fermion by m = 1
2 (a + b), so that the last term
is just the dirac equation with mass m, then we nd

a = m + g ,

b = m  g .

consequently, the supersymmetry transformation of the  equals

 = d/ (a + i5b)  m(a + i5b)  g(a  i5b)  ,

(20)

(21)

and the fermionic eld equation equals (d/ + m) = 0. the second term in
(21), which is proportional to m, can be accounted for by adding an auxiliary
eld to the supermultiplet. the third term, which is proportional to g, can be
understood as a compensating s-supersymmetry transformation associated
with auxiliary elds in the supergravity sector (see, e.g., [28]). in order to
construct the corresponding eld equations for a and b, we consider the
variation of the fermionic eld equation. again we have to take into account
that derivatives on the supersymmetry parameter are not equal to zero. this
yields the following second-order dierential equations,

[2ads + 2g2  m(m  g)] a = 0 ,
[2ads + 2g2  m(m + g)] b = 0 ,
[2ads + 3g2  m2]  = 0 .

(22)

the last equation follows from the dirac equation. namely, one evaluates
(d/  m)(d/ + m), which gives rise to the wave operator 2ads + 1
2 [d/ , d/ ] m2.

anti-de sitter supersymmetry

7

the commutator yields the riemann curvature of the anti-de sitter space. in
an anti-de sitter space of arbitrary dimension d this equation then reads,

[2ads + 1

4 d(d  1)g2  m2] = 0 ,

(23)

which, for d = 4 agrees with the last equation of (22). a striking feature of the
above result is that the eld equations (22) all have dierent mass terms, in
spite of the fact that they belong to the same supermultiplet. consequently,
the role of mass is quite dierent in anti-de sitter space as compared to at
minkowski space. this will be elucidated later.

for future applications we also evaluate the proca equation for a massive

vector eld,

d(a  a)  m2 a = 0 .

(24)
this leads to da = 0, so that the eld equation reads d2a[d, d]a
m2 a = 0 or, in anti-de sitter space,
[2ads + (d  1)g2  m2] a = 0 .
the g2 term in the eld equations for the scalar elds can be understood
from the observation that the scalar dalembertian can be extended to a
conformally invariant operator (see e.g. [28]),

(25)

2 +

1
4

d  2
d  1

r = 2 + 1

4 d(d  2) g2 ,

(26)

which seems the obvious candidate for a massless wave operator for scalar
elds. indeed, for d = 4, we do reproduce the g2 dependence in the rst
two equations (22). observe that the dirac operator d/ is also conformally
invariant and so is the wave equation associated with the maxwell eld.

4 the quadratic casimir operator

to make contact between the masslike terms in the wave equations and the
properties of the irreducible representations of the anti-de sitter group, it is
important that we establish a relation between the dalembertian in anti-de
sitter space and the quadratic casimir operator c2 of the isometry group. we
will use c2 later on in our discussion of the unitary irreducible representations
of the anti-de sitter algebra. in this section, we will use the (d+1)-dimensional
at embedding space, introduced in section 2, to obtain such a relation for
the scalar dalembertian. in the embedding space, the latter is equal to to

2d+1 = ab 
y a


y b .

(27)

denoting a = /y a and y 2 = aby ay b, we straightforwardly derive
an expression for the quadratic casimir operator associated with the anti-de

8

sitter group so(d  1, 2),
2 m ab mab

c2 =  1

= y a b(yab  yba)
= y 2 2d+1 + y aa (y bb + d  1) .

(28)

the group so(d  1, 2) has more casimir operators but the others are of
higher order in the generators and will not play a role in the following. we now
introduce dierent coordinates. we express the y a in terms of coordinates
x a, where x  = x with  = 0, 1, . . . , d  1 and x  is dened by

x  =  =pab y ay b .

furthermore, we require the -dependence to be such that

y a(x) =  ya(x) ,

(30)
so that ya(x) yb(x) ab = 1. with this choice of coordinates one readily

(29)

(31)

(32)

derives the following relations (ba = /x a),

y a ,

in the new coordinate system the metric is given by

by a ab y b =  ,
by a abby b = 0 ,

where g is the induced metric on the d-dimensional anti-de sitter space
(with radius equal to unity). note that g  det gab = 2d det g = 2dg.
the dalembertian of the embedding space in the new coordinates is
equal to (observe that derivatives act on all quantities on the right)

2d+1 =

(33)

where 2ads is the dalembertian for the anti-de sitter space of unit radius.
combining this with the expression (28) for the casimir operator, we nd

c2 = 2 2d+1 + 



(cid:16)




+ d  1(cid:17) = 2ads .

(34)

anti-de sitter supersymmetry

9

hence the / terms cancel as expected and the casimir operator is just
equal to the normalized anti-de sitter dalembertian with unit anti-de sitter
radius. note that this result cannot be used for other than spinless elds.

let us now return to the wave equation for massless scalars (26). ac-
cording to this equation, massless s = 0 elds lead to representations whose
casimir operator is equal to

c2 =  1

4 d(d  2) .

(35)

indeed, later in these lectures we will see that the casimir operator for a
massless s = 0 representation in four spacetime dimensions is equal to 2.

5 unitary representations of the anti-de sitter algebra

in this section we discuss unitary representations of the anti-de sitter algebra.
for deniteness we will mainly look at the case of four spacetime dimensions.
we refer to [4] for some of the original work, and to [19,20] where some of
this work was reviewed. in order to underline the general features we start
in d spacetime dimensions. obviously, the group so(d 2, 2) is noncompact.
this implies that unitary representations will be innitely dimensional. the
generators are then all anti-hermitean,

m 

ab = mab .

(36)

note that the covering group of so(d1, 2) has the generators 1
2 .
they act on spinors, which are nite-dimensional objects. these generators,
however, have dierent hermiticity properties from the ones above.

2  and 1

the compact subgroup of the anti-de sitter group is so(2)  so(d  1)
corresponding to rotations of the compact anti-de sitter time and spatial
rotations. it is convenient to decompose the 1
2 d(d + 1) generators as follows.
first, the generator m0 is related to the energy operator when the radius of
the anti-de sitter space is taken to innity. the eigenvalues of this generator,
which is associated with motions along the circle, are quantized in integer
units in order to have single-valued functions, unless one goes to the covering
space cads. so we dene the energy operator h by

h = im0 .

(37)

obviously the generators of the spatial rotations are the operators mab with
a, b = 1, . . . , d  1. note that we have changed notation: here and henceforth
the indices a, b, . . . refer only to spacelike indices. the remaining 2(d  1)
generators ma and m0a are combined into pairs of mutually conjugate op-
erators,

m 

a = im0a  ma ,

(38)

10

bernard de wit and ivan herger

and we have (m +
read

a ) = m 

a . the anti-de sitter commutation relations now

[h, m

a ] = m

(39)

a play the role of raising and lowering operators: when
a yields a

obviously, the m 
applied to an eigenstate of h with eigenvalue e, application of m 
state with eigenvalue e  1.
in this section we restrict ourselves to the bosonic case. nevertheless, let
us already briey indicate how some of the other (anti-)commutators of the
anti-de sitter superalgebra decompose c.f. (17),

{q , q

2 imab ( a b 0)
a  a (1 + i 0) + m 

} = h   1
2 (m +
2 i( 0 q) ,
2 (a(1  i 0) q) .

+ 1
[h , q] =  1
a , q] =  1
[m 

a  a (1  i 0)) ,

(40)

for the anti-de sitter superalgebra, all the bosonic operators can be expressed
as bilinears of the supercharges, so that in principle one could restrict oneself
to fermionic operators only and employ the projections (1  i 0)q as the
basic lowering and raising operators. however, this is not quite what we will
be doing later in section 7.

let us now assume that the spectrum of h is bounded from below,

h  e0 ,

(41)

so that in mathematical terms we are considering lowest-weight irreducible
unitary representations. the lowest eigenvalue e0 is realized on states that
we denote by |e0, si, where e0 is the eigenvalue of h and s indicates the value
of the total angular momentum operator. of course there are more quantum
numbers, e.g. associated with the angular momentum operator directed along
some axis (in d = 4 there are thus 2s + 1 degenerate states), but this is not
important for the construction and these quantum numbers are suppressed.
since states with e < e0 should not appear, ground states are characterized
by the condition,

m 

a |e0, si = 0 .

(42)

the representation can now be constructed by acting with the raising opera-
tors on the vacuum state |e0, si. to be precise, all states of energy e = e0 +n
are constructed by an n-fold product of creation operators m +
a in this way
one obtains states of higher eigenvalues e with higher spin. the simplest case
is the one where the vacuum has no spin (s = 0). for given eigenvalue e,

henceforth we specialize to the case d = 4 in order to keep the aspects

related to spin simple. to obtain spin- 1
product with a spin- 1
fig. 1 generates two points with spin j  1
associated with j = 0, which will simply move to j = 1
shown in fig. 2.

likewise one can take the direct product with a spin-1 state, but now
the situation is more complicated as the resulting multiplet is not always
irreducible. in principle, each point with spin j now generates three points,
associated with j and j  1, again with the exception of the j = 0 points,
which simply move to j = 1. the result of this procedure is shown in fig. 3.

let us now turn to the quadratic casimir operator, which for d spacetime

applying the last expression on the ground state |e0, si and assuming d = 4
we derive

c2 = e0(e0  3) + s(s + 1) ,

ing to the corresponding irreducible representation. note, that the angular

we can apply this result to an excited state (which is generically present
in the spectrum) with e = e0 + 1 and j = s  1. here, we assume that the
ground state has s  1. in that case we nd

this can be interpreted as the result of a gauge symmetry and therefore
we call these multiplets massless. hence massless multiplets with s  1 are
characterized by

one can try and use the same argument again to see if there is a possibility
that even more states decouple. consider for instance a state with the same

from the above it is clear that we are dealing with the phenomenon of mul-
tiplet shortening for specic values of the energy and spin of the ground state.
this can be understood more generally from the fact that the [m +
b ] com-
mutator acquires zero or negative eigenvalues for certain values of e0 and s.
we will return to this phenomenon in section 7 in the context of the anti-de
sitter superalgebra.

6 the oscillator construction

there exists a constructive procedure for determining the unitary irreducible
representations of the anti-de sitter algebra, which is known as the oscillator
method. this method can be used for any number of dimensions and also for
the supersymmetric extension of the anti-de sitter algebra [29,30]. here we
will demonstrate it for the case of four spacetime dimensions.

16

bernard de wit and ivan herger

consider an even n = 2p or an odd n = 2p+1 number of bosonic harmonic
oscillators, whose creation and annihilation operators transform as doublets
under the compact subgroup u(1)  su(2) of the covering group sp(4) =
so(3, 2). we introduce pairs of mutually commuting annihilation operators
ai(r) and bi(r) labeled by r = 1, . . . , p and an optional annihilation operator
ci when we wish to consider an odd number of oscillators. the indices i are
the doublet indices associated with su(2). the nonvanishing commutation
relations are

[ai(r), aj (s)] = i
[bi(r), bj (s)] = i
[ci, cj] = i

j rs ,
j rs ,
j ,

(55)

where the creation operators carry upper su(2) indices and are dened by
ai = (ai), bi = (bi) and ci = (ci). the generators of u(1) su(2) are then
given by

u i

j = ai  aj + bj  bi + 1

2 (ci cj + cj ci) ,

where ai  aj stands for pr ai(r) aj (r). the u(1) generator will be denoted

i and can be expressed as

by q = 1

(56)

(57)

2 u i
2 (ai  ai + bi  bi + 1
2 cici)
2 (ai  ai + bi  bi + cici + 2p + 1)
2 (n + n) ,

2 cici + 1

q = 1
= 1
= 1

where n is the number operator for the oscillator states. observe that q
is associated with the generator that we previously identied with the en-
ergy operator. the other generators, transforming according to the 3 + 3
representation of su(2), are dened by
sij = (sij ) = ai  bj + aj  bi + ci cj .

(58)

it is now easy to identify the raising and lowering operators by considering
the commutation relations of q with all the other operators,

[q , u i

j] = 0 ,

[q , sij] = sij ,

[q , sij] = sij .

together with

[sij, skl] = [sij, skl] = 0 ,
[sij, skl] = i

l + i

k u j

(59)

(60)

we recover all commutation relations of so(3, 2). obviously, the operators sij
raise the eigenvalue of q, when acting on its eigenstates, while their hermitian
conjugates sij lower the eigenvalue. let us, for the sake of completeness, write
down the commutation relations of q with the oscillators,

[q , ai] = 1

2 ai ,

[q , ai] =  1

2 ai .

(61)

anti-de sitter supersymmetry

17

we see that ai raises the energy by half a unit whereas ai lowers it by the
same amount. the same relations hold of course true for the oscillators bi
and ci. the ground state |i is then dened by

sij|i = 0 .

(62)

the representation is built by acting with an arbitrary product of raising
operators sij on the ground state. depending on the number of oscillators we
have chosen certain states will be present whereas others will not. in this way
the shortening of the multiplets will be achieved automatically. experience
has taught us that the oscillator construction is complete in the sense that
it yields all unitary irreducible representations. however, it is not possible to
describe the construction for arbitrary dimension, as every case has its own
characteristic properties.

the obvious choice for |i is the vacuum state |0i of the oscillator algebra.
however, there are other possibilities. for example, we can act on |0i by any
number of dierent creation operators, i.e. ai(r1) aj(r2) bk(r3)|0i, as long
as we do not include a pair ai(r1) bj(r2) with r1 = r2, unless it is anti-
ssymmetrized in indices i and j. the reason is that sij consists of terms that
are linear in both ai(r1) and bj(r2) annihilation operators with r1 = r2 and
with symmetrized su(2) indices. let us now turn to a number of relevant
examples in order to clarify the procedure.

assume that we have a single harmonic oscillator (i.e. n = 1). then
there are two possible ground states. one is |i = |0i. in that case we have
e0 = q = 1
2 and s = 0. the states take the form of products of even numbers
of creation operators, i.e. ci cj ck |0i, which are symmetric in the su(2)
indices because the creation operators are mutually commuting. obviously
these states comprise states of spin 1, 2, 3, . . . with multiplicity one. this is
the s = 0 singleton representation. the spin- 1
2 singleton follows from choosing
the ground state |i = ci|0i, which has e0 = q = 1 and s = 1
2 . the states are
again generated by even product of creation operators which lead to states
of spin 3

2 , . . . with multiplicity one.

2 , 5

let us now consider the case of two oscillators (n = 2). here we distinguish

the following ground states and corresponding irreducible representations:

 one obvious ground state is the oscillator ground state, |i = |0i. in
that case we have e0 = q = 1 and s = 0. this is the massless s = 0
representation.

 alternative ground states are |i = ai|0i or |i = bi|0i. in that case the
2 . this is the massless s = 1

2 and s = 1

ground state has e0 = q = 3
representation.

2

 yet another option is to choose |i equal to m annihilation operators
exclusively of the a-type or of the b-type, applied to |0i. this ground
state has e0 = q = 1 + 1
2 m. from the values of e0 and s
one deduces that these are precisely the massless spin-s representations.

2 m and s = 1

18

bernard de wit and ivan herger

 finally one may choose |i = (ai bj  aj bi)|0i, which has e0 = q = 2

and s = 0. this is the second massless s = 0 representation.

to sum up, for a single oscillator one recovers the singleton representa-
tions and for two oscillators one obtains all massless representations. the
excited states in a given representation are constructed by applying arbi-
trary products of an even number of creation operators on the ground state.
for more than two oscillators, one obtains the massive representations. this
pattern, sometimes with small variations, repeats itself for other than four
spacetime dimensions.

7 the superalgebra osp(1|4)

in this section we return to the anti-de sitter superalgebra. we start from
the (anti-)commutation relations already established in (39) and (40). for
deniteness we discuss the case of four spacetime dimensions with a majorana
supercharge q. this allows us to make contact with the material discussed
in section 3. these anti-de sitter multiplets were discussed in [17,18,19,20].

we choose conventions where the gamma matrices are given by

 and the indices , , . . . are two-component spinor indices. we

where we have dened the angular momentum operator ja =  1
2 i abcm bc.
we see that the operators q and q are lowering and raising operators,
respectively. they change the energy of a state by half a unit.

in analogy to the bosonic case, we study unitary irreducible representa-
tions of the osp(1|4) superalgebra. we assume that there exists a lowest-
weight state |e0, si, characterized by the fact that it is annihilated by the
lowering operators q,

q|e0, si = 0 .

substitute these denitions into (40) and obtain

anti-de sitter supersymmetry

19

in principle we can now choose a ground state and build the whole represen-
tation upon it by applying products of raising operators q. however, we only
have to study the antisymmetrized products of the q, because the symmetric
ones just yield products of the operators m +
a by virtue of (65). products of
the m +
a simply lead to the higher-energy states in the anti-de sitter represen-
tations of given spin that we considered in section 5. by restricting ourselves
to the antisymmetrized products of the q we thus restrict ourselves to the
ground states upon which the full anti-de sitter representations are build.
these ground states are |e0, si, q|e0, si and q[q]|e0, si. let us briey
discuss these representations for dierent s.
the s = 0 case is special since it contains less anti-de sitter represen-
tations than the generic case. it includes the spinless states |e0, 0i and
q[q]|e0, 0i with ground-state energies e0 and e0 + 1, respectively. there is
one spin- 1
2 . as we will see
below, these states correspond exactly to the scalar eld a, the pseudo-scalar
eld b and the spinor eld  of the chiral supermultiplet, that we studied in
section 3.

2 pair of ground states q|e0, 0i, with energy e0 + 1

for s  1

2 we are in the generic situation. we obtain the ground states
|e0, si and q[q]|e0, si which have both spin s and which have energies e0
and e0 + 1, respectively. there are two more (degenerate) ground states,
q|e0, si, both with energy e0 + 1
2 , which decompose into the ground states
with spin j = s  1
2 and j = s + 1
2 .
as in the purely bosonic case of section 5, there can be situations in which
states decouple so that we are dealing with multiplet shortening associated
with gauge invariance in the corresponding eld theory. the corresponding
multiplets are then again called massless. we now discuss this in a general
way analogous to the way in which one discusses bps multiplets in at space.
namely, we consider the matrix elements of the operator q q between the
(2s + 1)-degenerate ground states |e0, si,

he0, s| qq |e0, si = he0, s|{q , q}|e0, si
= he0, s|(e0 1 + j  )

|e0, si .

(67)

this expression constitutes an hermitean matrix in both the quantum num-
bers of the degenerate groundstate and in the indices  and , so that it is
(4s+2)-by-(4s+2). because we assume that the representation is unitary, this
matrix must be positive denite, as one can verify by inserting a complete set
of intermediate states between the operators q and q in the matrix element
on the left-hand side. obviously, the right-hand side is manifestly hermitean
as well, but in order to be positive denite the eigenvalue e0 of h must be
big enough to compensate for possible negative eigenvalues of j  , where
the latter is again regarded as a (4s + 2)-by-(4s + 2) matrix. to determine
its eigenvalues, we note that j   satises the following identity,

(j  )2 + (j  ) = s(s + 1)1 ,

(68)

20

bernard de wit and ivan herger

as follows by straightforward calculation. this shows that j   has only two
(degenerate) eigenvalues (assuming s 6= 0, so that the above equation is not
trivially satised), namely s and (s + 1). hence in order for (67) to be
positive denite, e0 must satisfy the inequality

e0  s + 1 ,

for s  1
2 ,

(69)

if the bound is saturated, i.e. if e0 = s + 1, the expression on the right-
hand side of (67) has zero eigenvalues so that there are zero-norm states in
the multiplet which decouple. in that case we must be dealing with a mass-
less multiplet. as an example we mention the case s = 1
2 , which
corresponds to the massless vector supermultiplet in four spacetime dimen-
sions. observe that we have multiplet shortening here without the presence
of central charges.

2 , e0 = 3

one can also use the oscillator method discussed in the previous section
to construct the irreducible representations. this is, for instance, done in
[21,22].

armed with these results we return to the masslike terms of section 3 for
the chiral supermultiplet. the ground-state energy for anti-de sitter multi-
plets corresponding to the scalar eld a, the pseudo-scalar eld b and the
majorana spinor eld , are equal to e0, e0 + 1 and e0 + 1
2 , respectively.
the casimir operator therefore takes the values

c2(a) = e0(e0  3) ,
c2(b) = (e0 + 1)(e0  2) ,
c2() = (e0 + 1
2 )(e0  5

2 ) + 3
4 .

(70)

for massless anti-de sitter multiplets, we know that the quadratic casimir
operator is given by (48), so we present the value for c2  2(s2  1) for the
three multiplets, i.e

c2(a) + 2 = (e0  1)(e0  2) ,
c2(b) + 2 = e0(e0  1) ,
2 = (e0  1)2 .
c2() + 3

(71)

the terms on the right-hand side are not present for massless elds and we
should therefore identify them somehow with the common mass parameter.
comparison with the eld equations (22) shows for g = 1 that we obtain
the correct contributions provided we make the identication e0 = m + 1.
observe that we could have made a slightly dierent identication here; the
above result remains the same under the interchange of a and b combined
with a change of sign in m (the latter is accompanied by a chiral redenition
of ).

outside the context of supersymmetry, we could simply assign indepen-
dent mass terms with a mass parameter  for each of the elds, by equating
c2  2(s2  1) to 2. in this way we obtain

e0(e0  3)  (s + 1)(s  2) = 2 ,

(72)

which leads to

e0 = 3

2 q(s  1

2 )2 + 2 .

anti-de sitter supersymmetry

21

(73)

for s  1
2 we must choose the plus sign in (73) in order to satisfy the unitarity
bound e0  s + 1. for s = 0 both signs are acceptable as long as 2 
3
4 . observe, however, that 2 can be negative but remains subject to the
condition 2  (s  1
2 )2 in order that e0 remains real. for s = 0, this is
precisely the bound of breitenlohner and freedman for the stability of the
anti-de sitter background against small uctuations of the scalar elds [17].
we can also compare c2 2(s2 1) to the conformal wave operator for the
corresponding spin. this shows that (again with unit anti-de sitter radius),
c2 = 2ads + s, where s is a real number depending on the spin of the eld.
comparison with the eld equations of section 3 shows that s equals 0, 3
2
and 3, for s = 0, 1

2 and 1, respectively.

in the case of n -extended supersymmetry the supercharges transform
under an so(n ) group and we are dealing with the so-called osp(n|4) alge-
bras. their representations can be constructed by the methods discussed in
these lectures. however, the generators of so(n ) will now also appear on the
right-hand side of the anticommutator of the two supercharges, thus leading
to new possibilities for multiplet shortening. for an explicit discussion of this
we refer the reader to [19].

8 conclusions

in these lectures we discussed the irreducible representations of the anti-de
sitter algebra and its superextension. most of our discussion was restricted
to four spacetime dimensions, but in principle the same methods can be used
for anti-de sitter spacetimes of arbitrary dimension.

for higher-extended supergravity, the only way to generate a cosmological
constant is by elevating a subgroup of the rigid invariances that act on the
gravitini to a local group. this then leads to a cosmological constant, or to
a potential with possibly a variety of extrema, and corresponding masslike
terms which are quadratic and linear in the gauge coupling constant, re-
spectively. so the relative strength of the anti-de sitter and the gauge group
generators on the right-hand side of the {q, q} anticommutator is not ar-
bitrary and because of that maximal multiplet shortening can take place so
that the theory can realize a supermultiplet of massless states that contains
the graviton and the gravitini. of course, this is all under the assumption
that the ground state is supersymmetric. but these topics are outside the
scope of these lectures and will be reviewed elsewhere [31].
