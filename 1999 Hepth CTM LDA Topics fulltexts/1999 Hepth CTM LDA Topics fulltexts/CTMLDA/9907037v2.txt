introduction

very little is known about d-branes [1], [2], [3], in curved backgrounds [4] and
what restrictions, if any, should be imposed on such backgrounds . supersymme-
try imposes constraints on the background metric. in the case of the superstring
with world sheet supersymmetry, there is a direct relation between the number
of supersymmetries and the background metric [5]. in at background geome-
try the d0-brane action has 16 space-time supersymmetries, and it is natural
to ask for the type of curved backgrounds compatible with this symmetry. the
action with 8 space-time supersymmetries (n = 2 in 4 dimensions ) was shown
to correspond to kahler backgrounds [6].

in general it is dicult to construct such actions without having determined
the underlying symmetry. there are few possible routes to handle this problem,
the most obvious one is to quantize the d-brane action in the presence of a
general superspace metric, thus keeping all supersymmetries, and to determine
what are the required constraints on such a metric [7], [8]. this is expected to
be extremely complicated and only recently some work has been done in this
direction [9]. the other possibility is to determine the necessary elds to make a
supersymmetric multiplet and to nd the corresponding invariant action under
such transformations. we shall follow a simpler approach, which is straightfor-
ward but which the drawback that the underlying symmetry is not manifest.
the idea is based on the observation that the supersymmetric d-0 brane action
was obtained by dimensionally reducing the super yang-mills action from ten
to 0+1 dimensions [8]. the most general supersymmetric interaction in ten di-
mensions with n = 1 supersymmetry is that of supergravity coupled to super
yang-mills with an arbitrary gauge group [10]. dimensional reduction keeps
maximal supresymmetry and rearranges the scalar elds to have the action of a
non-linear sigma model on a coset space. reducing to 0+1 dimensions have the
peculiarity that there is no gravitational part and the only elds coming from the
gravity sector in ten-dimensions yields scalar elds. similarly the vector elds
coming from the yang-mills part give scalar elds taking values in the adjoint
representation of the gauge group. as with compactication of supergravity
theory it is expected that the coset space to be of the form [11]

so(9, 9 + n)

so(9)  so(9 + n)  u (1)

where n = n 2
 1 is the dimension of su (n ) gauge group. the absence
of the gravitational sector in 0+1 dimensions also enables us to identify the
gravitational coupling in higher dimensions with the string tension to insure that
all rescaled scalar elds have the same dimensions and could serve as coordinates
of the d-brane.

the aim of this letter is to derive the d0-brane action with the most general
curved background compatible with maximal space-time supersymmetry. this
is done by compactifying the ten-dimensional theory and grouping all the resul-
tant elds. the result obtained does not have manifest symmetry. nonetheless,
this suggests that a direct derivation in terms of supermultiplets, where some
auxiliary elds as well as constrained variables are used, might drastically sim-
plify the answer. this is the situation encountered in the derivation of the
four-dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric action where superconformal methods
were used to simplify the analysis [12]. this more systematic approach will be

left for the future and our study here will be limited to the action obtained by
dimensional reduction. the plan of this paper is as follows. in section 2 we
derive the bosonic dimensionally reduced action and in section 3 we give the
fermionic part. section four includes comments on the results.

2 bosonic action of curved d0-branes.

our starting point is the n = 1 supergravity lagrangian in ten dimensions
coupled to super yang-mills system. this is given by (up to quartic fermionic
terms) [10]

we can reduce this action from 10 to d dimensions with the following distribution
of elds. the metric gm n gives a metric g , m vectors and 1
2 m (m + 1) scalars
in d dimensions, where m = 10  d. the antisymmetric tensor bm n gives
b , m vectors and 1
, and nm
scalars ai
m, where n is the dimension of the gauge group. all in all we will have
m (n + m) scalars which will span the coset space [11]

2 m (m  1) scalars. the gauge elds ai

interested in have m = 9.

gives the at background d-0 brane action plus the order 6 terms in x i
m.this
is usually incompatible with supersymmetry as we shall show later. the proper
limit to at backgrounds can be obtained by keeping the couplings  and 
independent, then taking the limit   0.

in this action the coset space symmetry is not manifest. the coset space
metric is a non-polynomial function of gmn, bmn, x i
m and . to obtain manifest
symmetry, one method would be to start with the symmetry so(9, 9 + n) using
supersymmetric multiplets, and then gauge the so(9)  so(9 + n) subgroup.
this will be the topic of a forthcoming project where a systematic analysis of
all possible background symmetries would be carried out.

from these transformations it should be clear that the truncation gmn =
mn, bmn = 0,  = 0 is not consistent with supersymmetry because the elds
x i
m, gmn, bmn and  are now mixed to form 9(9 + n) + 1 coordinates for the
d-0 brane. a proper way of going to the at background limit is to keep  and
 distinct, and then take the limit   0.

the d0-brane action with maximal n = 16 space-time supersymmetry, derived
so(9)so(9+n) which, however, is not manifest.
here have the coset symmetry
the 81 elds which are not related to the su (n ) gauge group are essential to
provide curvature for the background. we can say that curved backgrounds are

so(9,9+n)

only possible once n gauge elds are embedded into the above coset structure.
one way to improve on this solution is to start with the light-cone formulation
of the supermembrane in arbitrary background and nd under what conditions
the quantized action simplies in such a manner as not to involve a square
root. this is a dicult problem and the recent work of weakly coupling d0-
branes to curved backgrounds may help to clarify the situation [9]. the action
constructed in [9] contains higher order time derivatives indicating that higher
derivative terms in ten-dimensional supergravity should also be included.
it
would also be very interesting to nd out how the 82 scalar elds arise in this
formulation.

another possibility is to study supersymmetry representations in 0+1 di-
mensions and form multiplets in complete analogy with the one obtained by
superconformal methods in four dimensions. this would have the advantage of
getting the coset space symmetry in a manifestly invariant way. in addition this
would allow to investigate the general problem of nding the relation between
the required degree of space-time supersymmetry and the nature of the curved
background.
