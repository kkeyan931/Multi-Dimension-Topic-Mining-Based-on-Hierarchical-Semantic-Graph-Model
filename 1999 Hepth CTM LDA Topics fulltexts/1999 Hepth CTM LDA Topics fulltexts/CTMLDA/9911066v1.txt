1. introduction

the problem of unifying quantum mechanics and gravity is one of the
great unsolved problems in twentieth century physics. progress has been
slowed by our inability to carry out relevant physical experiments. some
progress has nevertheless been possible, largely through the use of gedanken
experiments.

the quantum mechanical black hole has been a key ingredient of these
gedanken experiments, beginning with [1, 2]. it provides an arena in which
quantum mechanics and gravity meet head on. such gedanken experiments
have led to an astonishing depth and variety of insights, not only about
the black holes themselves, but about string theory and quantum eld the-
ory in general. nevertheless many aspects of quantum black holes remain
enigmatic, and we expect they will continue to be a source of new insights.
studies of quantum black holes have largely focused on the problem of
quantum elds or strings interacting (by scattering or evaporation) with a
single black hole. in these lectures we will address a dierent, less studied,
type of gedanken experiment, involving an arbitrary number n of super-
symmetric black holes. congurations of n static black holes parametrize
a moduli space mn [3, 4, 5]. the low-lying quantum states of the system
are governed by quantum mechanics on mn . as we shall see the problem
of describing these states has a number of interesting and puzzling features.
in particular mn has noncompact, innite-volume regions corresponding
to near-coincident black holes. these regions lead to infrared divergences
and presents a challenge for obtaining a unitary description of multi-black
hole scattering.

the main goal of these lectures is to describe the recent discovery of
a superconformal structure [6, 7, 8, 9] in multi-black hole quantum me-
chanics. while the appearance of scale invariance at low energies follows
simply from dimensional analysis, the appearance of the full conformal in-
variance requires particular values of the various couplings and is not a
priori guaranteed. this structure is relevant both to the infrared diver-
gences and the scattering, which however remain to be fully understood.
we begin these lectures by developing the subject of conformal and super-
conformal quantum mechanics with n particles. section 2 describes the
simplest example [10] of single-particle conformally invariant quantum me-
chanics. the infrared problems endemic to conformal quantum mechanics
as well as their generic cure is discussed in this context. section 3 contains
a discussion of conformally invariant n -particle quantum mechanics. su-
perconformal quantum mechanics is described in section 4. in section 5 the
case of a test particle moving in a black hole geometry is discussed (follow-
ing [11]) as a warm-up to the multi-black hole problem. the related issues

scqm and multi-black hole moduli spaces

3

of conformal invariance, infrared divergences and choices of time coordinate
appear and are discussed in this simple context. in section 6 the ve dimen-
sional multi-black hole moduli space as well as its supersymmetric struc-
ture are described. it is shown that at low energies the supersymmetries are
doubled and the d(2, 1; 0) superconformal group makes an appearance. we
close with a conjecture in section 7 on the possible relation to an m-brane
description of the black hole and ads2/cft1 duality [12].

many of the results described herein appeared recently in [13, 14].

2. a simple example of conformal quantum mechanics

let us consider the following hamiltonian [10]:

h =

p2
2

+

g
2x2 .

(2.1)

in order to have an energy spectrum that is bounded from below, it turns
out that we need to take g  1/4, but otherwise g is an arbitrary coupling
constant, though, following [10], we will consider only g > 0. next introduce
the operators

d = 1

2 (px + xp)

k = 1

2 x2.

(2.2)

d is known as the generator of dilations  it generates rescalings xx
and pp/  and k is the generator of special conformal transformations.
these operators obey the sl(2, r) algebra

(cid:2)d, h(cid:3) = 2ih,
(cid:2)d, k(cid:3) = 2ik,
(cid:2)h, k(cid:3) = id.

(2.3a)

(2.3b)

(2.3c)

since d and k do not commute with the hamiltonian, they do not generate
symmetries in the usual sense of relating degenerate states. rather they can
be used to to relate states with dierent eigenvalues of h [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

exercise 1 show that for any quantum mechanics with operators obeying
the sl(2, r) algebra (2.3), that if |ei is a state of energy e, then eid|ei
is a state of energy e2e. thus, if there is a state of nonzero energy, then
the spectrum is continuous.

it follows from exercise 1 that the spectrum of the hamiltonian (2.1) is
continuous, and its eigenstates are not normalizable. hence it is awkward
to describe the theory in terms of h eigenstates.

this problem is easily rectied. consider the linear combinations

(2.4a)

(2.4b)

where a is a parameter with dimensions of length-squared. these obey the
sl(2, r) algebra in the virasoro form,

(cid:2)l1, l1(cid:3) = 2l0

(cid:2)l0, l1(cid:3) = l1.

in the following, we choose our units such that a = 1.

with the denitions (2.4b), (2.1) and (2.2), we have

l0 =

(2.6)

the potential energy part of this operator achieves its minimum and asymp-
totes to  (see gure 1) and thus has a discrete spectrum with normalizable
eigenstates.

exercise 2 show that

l2 = l0(l0  1)  l1l1

(2.7)

is the sl(2, r) casimir operator. thus show that, of the eigenstates of l0,
that with the smallest value of l0 is annihilated by l1. also show that the
eigenvalues of l0 form an innite tower above the ground state, in integer
steps.

exercise 3 show that for the dff model, the casimir operator (2.7)
takes the value

and thus that the ground state has l0 = 1
that the positive root is that for which the state is normalizable.)

from exercise 2, we learn that the spectrum of l0 is well dened, and
thus has normalizable eigenstates. this motivated dff to trade h for l0,
and use l0 to generate the dynamics. we then have a well dened theory;
this also justies our use of the term ground state in exercises 2 and 3.
at this point it is a free world and one has the right to describe the
theory in terms of l0 rather than h eigenstates. later on this issue will
reappear in the context of black hole physics, and the trade of h for l0
will take on a deeper signicance.

3. conformally invariant n-particle quantum mechanics

in this section, we nd the conditions under which a general n -particle
quantum mechanics admits an sl(2, r) symmetry. specically, we derive
the conditions for the existence of operators d and k obeying the al-
gebra (2.3). n -particle quantum mechanics can be described as a sigma
model with an n -dimensional target space. the general hamiltonian is1

h = 1

(3.1)

where a, b = 1, . . . , n and the metric g is a function of x. the canonical

momentum pa obeys (cid:2)pa, x b(cid:3) = ib

a and (cid:2)pa, pb(cid:3) = 0, and is given by

pa = gab x b = ia.

ab is the christoel symbol built from the metric gab, and the dagger

functions (x).

1in this and all subsequent expressions, the operator ordering is as indicated.

6 britto-pacumio, michelson, strominger and volovich

we rst determine the conditions under which the theory, dened by

equation (3.1), admits a dilational symmetry of the general form

dx a = da(x).

this symmetry is generated by an operator

d = 1

2 dapa + h.c.

which should obey equation (2.3a),

from the denitions (3.5) and (3.1), one nds

(cid:2)d, h(cid:3) = 2ih.

d gab = dcgab,c + dc

,agcb + dc

,bgac.

(3.4)

(3.5)

(2.3a)

(3.6)

(3.7)

comparing equations (3.7) and (2.3a) reveals that a dilational symmetry
exists if and only if there exists a conformal killing vector d obeying

and

d gab = 2gab

d v = 2v.

(3.8a)

(3.8b)

note that equation (3.8a) implies the vanishing of the last term of equa-
tion (3.6). a vector eld d obeying (3.8a) is known as a homothetic
vector eld, and the action of d is known as a homothety (pronounced
hmawthitee).

next we look for a special conformal symmetry generated by an operator

k = k(x) obeying equations (2.3b) and (2.3c):

(cid:2)d, k(cid:3) = 2ik,
(cid:2)h, k(cid:3) = id.

with equation (3.5), equation (2.3b) is equivalent to

d k = 2k,

(2.3b)

(2.3c)

(3.9)

scqm and multi-black hole moduli spaces

7

while equation (2.3c) can be written

dadx a = dk.

(3.10)

hence the one-form d is exact. one can solve for k as the norm of da,

k = 1

2 gabdadb,

(3.11)

which is globally well dened. we shall adopt the phrase closed homo-
thety to refer to a homothety whose associated one-form is closed and
exact.

exercise 5 show that conversely, given a vector eld da obeying equa-
tion (3.8a) and dd = 0, that dadx a = dk where k is dened by equa-
tion (3.11). thus, every closed homothety is an exact homothety, and
there is no signicance in our choice of phrase. (we have chosen to use the
phrase closed homothety in order to avoid confusion with a discussion of,
say, quantum corrections.)

exercise 6 show that if a manifold admits a homothety (not necessarily
closed), then the manifold is noncompact.

we should emphasize that the existence of d did not guarantee the exis-
tence of k. it is not hard [14] to nd examples of quantum mechanics with a
d for which the corresponding unique candidate for k (by equation (3.11))
obeys neither equations (2.3c) nor (3.10). indeed a generic homothety is not
closed.2

4. superconformal quantum mechanics

this section considers supersymmetric quantum mechanics with up to four
supersymmetries and superconformal extensions with up to eight supersym-
metries. in lower dimensions the poincare groups are smaller and hence so
are the supergroups. this implies a richer class of supersymmetric struc-
tures for a given number of supercharges. in particular, in one dimension
we shall encounter structures which cannot be obtained by reduction from
higher dimensions.

2one can nd even four dimensional theories that are dilationally, but not conformally,
invariant by including higher derivative terms; for a scalar eld (x), the lagrangian
l = f (  
)4 is dilationally invariant for any function f , but it is conformally invari-
ant only for f (y) =  1

4.1. a brief diversion on supergroups

roughly, a supergroup is a group of matrices that take the block form




a f1

f2 b

,




(4.1)

where a, b are ordinary matrices, and f1,2 are fermionic matrices. we are
interested in quantum mechanics with a supersymmetry whose supergroup
includes sl(2, r); that is, supergroups of the form




sl(2, r)

fermionic

fermionic r-symmetry

.




(4.2)

there are many such supergroups; these have been tabulated in table 1.

one simple series of supergroups is the osp(m|n) series; the elements

of osp(m|n) have the form



.




(4.3)

sp(n)

fermionic

fermionic

so(m)

since sp(2) = sl(2, r) 3 we are interested in osp(m|2). the simplest
of these is osp(1|2), which is a subgroup of the others. we will describe
the models with this symmetry group, for the supermultiplet dened in
section 4.2, in section 4.3. we will skip osp(2|2) = su (1, 1|1) 4  these
models were described in [13]  and go directly to osp(4|2). in fact, it will
turn out that, for the supermultiplet we consider, we will naturally obtain
d(2, 1; ) as the symmetry group, where  is a parameter that depends
on the target space geometry. osp(4|2) is the special case of  = 2,
and appears, for example, when the target space is at. the black hole
system described in section 6 will turn out to have d(2, 1; 0) superconformal
symmetry.5 we will explain this statement, and describe d(2, 1; ) in more

3the notation is such that only sp(2n) exist.
4the supergroup u (m, n|p) is generated by matrices of the form (4.1), with
a  u (m, n) and b  u (p). the subalgebra in which the matrices also obey tr a = tr b
generates su (m, n|p). however, with this denition, su (m, n|p = m + n) is not even
semisimple, for the identity matrix obeys tr a = tr b and generates a u (1) factor. the
quotient p su (m, n|m + n) = su (m, n|m + n)/u (1) is simple, and is often denoted just
su (m, n|m + n), as we have done for su (1, 1|2).

5d(2, 1; 0) (and d(2, 1; )) is omitted from table 1 because it is the semidirect prod-

uct su (1, 1|2)  su (2) and is therefore not simple.

detail, in section 4.4. first, we should describe the supermultiplet under
consideration.

4.2. quantum mechanical supermultiplets

there are many supermultiplets that one can construct in one dimension. in
particular, unlike in higher dimensions, the smaller supersymmetry group
does not require a matching of the numbers of bosonic and fermionic elds.
much of the literature  see, e.g. [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]  concerns the

10 britto-pacumio, michelson, strominger and volovich

so-called type a multiplet, with a real boson and complex fermion (x a, a),
which can be obtained by dimensional reduction of the 1 + 1 dimensional
n = (1, 1) multiplet.
this is not the multiplet we will consider here. for the black hole physics
that we will eventually consider, each black hole will have four bosonic
(translational) degrees of freedom, as well as four fermionic degrees of free-
dom from the breaking of one half of the minimal (8 supercharge) super-
symmetry in ve dimensions.6 thus, we will consider the type b multiplet,
consisting of a real boson and a real fermion (x a, a = a). the super-
symmetry transformation, parametrized by a real grassman parameter ,
is given by

x a = ia

a =  x a,

(4.4)

where the overdot denotes a time derivative.

exercise 7 in an n = 1 superspace formalism, the type b multiplet is
given by a real supermultiplet x a(t, ) = x a(t, ), where  is the (real)
fermionic coordinate, and we use the standard convention in which the low-
est component of the supereld is notationally almost indistinguishable from
the supereld itself. in components, we write

x a(t, ) = x a(t)  ia(t).

(4.5)

the generator of supersymmetry transformations, q (which obeys q2 =
h = i d

dt ) is given by

q =




+ i

d
dt

.

show that

x a = (cid:2)q, x a(cid:3),

(4.6)

(4.7)

as expected. note also that q = q, and thus both sides of equation (4.7)
are, indeed, real. for completeness, we dene the superderivative

bosons and 4 fermions [23].

scqm and multi-black hole moduli spaces

11

as we have already mentioned, there are many more multiplets than

just the type b one; see e.g. [24, 23].

4.3. osp(1|2)invariant quantum mechanics
we now proceed to the simplest superconformal quantum mechanics for the
type b supermultiplet dened in the previous subsection. as in section 3,
we use a hamiltonian formalism.

in general, the supercharge takes the form

(4.9)

(4.10)

where abc is the spin connection with the last two indices contracted with
the vielbein, and cabc is a (so-far) general 3-form. the hamiltonian is then
given by

h = 1

2(cid:8)q, q(cid:9).

(4.11)

we remark that the bosonic part of this hamiltonian is the special case of
equation (3.1) with v = 0.

finally, show that equation (4.9) follows from equation (4.4) (or (4.7)).
we note that, from equation (4.15), the fermions  obey the canonical

anticommutation relation

(cid:8), (cid:9) =  ,

and commute with x a and pa.7 it follows from equation (4.17), that the
fermions can be represented on the hilbert space by  = /2, where
 are the so(n) -matrices (n is the dimension of the target space), and
that the wavefunction is an so(n) spinor. thus a is just the covariant
derivative (with torsion c  see appendix a for a brief summary of calculus
with torsion) on the hilbert space.8

so far we have only discussed n = 1 supersymmetric quantum mechan-
ics, whereas we would like to discuss superconformal quantum mechanics.
we have already shown in section 3 that in order to have conformal quan-
tum mechanics, the metric gab must admit a closed homothety da, out
of which were built the operators d and k. the supersymmetric exten-
sions of the expressions (3.5) and (3.11) for d and k  that is including
fermions  are given by replacing the pa in equation (3.5) (which is a
covariant derivative on the scalar wavefunction of the bosonic theory) with
the covariant derivative a:9

8it also follows [25, 26] that, for these theories, the witten index, tr(1)f [17, 18], is

equivalent to the atiyah-singer index.

however, it turns out that closure of the superalgebra places two constraints

4.4. d(2, 1; )invariant quantum mechanics

the d(2, 1; ) algebra is an n = 4 (actually n = 4b, since we use the
type b supermultiplet) superconformal algebra, and thus contains four
supercharges qm, m = 1, . . . , 4, and their superconformal partners sm.
of course, for xed m, qm, sm, h, k, d should satisfy the osp(1|2) alge-
bra (4.22). in addition, as is evident from table 1, there are two (commut-
ing) sets of su (2) r-symmetry generators rr
, r = 1, 2, 3, under which the
supercharges qm and sm transform as (2,2). there are no other genera-
tors, and the complete set of (anti)commutation relations, which dene the
algebra, are [27]

(cid:2)h, k(cid:3) = id,

clearly the d(2, 1; ) algebra is not dened for  = 1; for  = 0 (),

tions (4.23), and thus the group is the semidirect product of su (1, 1|2) 10
(the unique group in table 1 with the correct number of generators and
bosonic subalgebra) and su (2).

before we discuss the conditions under which the action (4.15) admits a
d(2, 1; ) superconformal symmetry, we should rst discuss the conditions
for n = 4b supersymmetry.
4.4.1. n = 4b supersymmetric quantum mechanics.
the conditions on the geometry for an n = 4b theory have been given
in [24, 28]. we will repeat them in the simplied form given in [13]. the
object is to nd supercharges qm, such that

(cid:8)qm, qn(cid:9) = 2mnh.

(4.25)

we take q4 to be the q of equation (4.9)  i.e. the noether charge as-
sociated with the symmetry generated by equation (4.4). we now look for
three more symmetry transformations such that

where (m)
is the mth supersymmetry transformation, generated by the

transformations according to the following rather tedious exercise.

from exercise 10, we learn that supersymmetry requires a complex tar-

tions (4.31c) and (4.31d). equation (4.31c) states that the metric is hermi-
tian with respect to each complex structure. equation (4.31d) is a highly
nontrivial dierential constraint between the complex structures, which
generalizes the hyperkahler condition, and from which the torsion cabc is
uniquely determined. it is equivalent to the condition that the quaternionic

a manifold that satises the conditions (4.31) is known as a hyperkahler
with torsion (hkt) (or sometimes weak hkt) manifold.

4.4.2. n = 4b superconformal quantum mechanics
we must now nd the further restrictions to a d(2, 1; )-invariant super-
conformal quantum mechanics. clearly, this will include equations (3.8a),
(3.10) and (4.20). the additional restrictions are obtained by demanding
the proper behaviour of the r-symmetries, and are most easily phrased by
dening the vector elds

equation (4.36) implies equation (4.35).

these are the necessary and sucient conditions for the quantum me-
chanics dened by (4.13) to be d(2, 1; ) superconformal. they imply that

j r = ( + 1)(drdk  1

2 rstdsdtk);

(4.37)

i.e. that (at least for  6= 0) the hkt metric is described by a potential
which is proportional to k. actually, as discussed in more detail in [13],
when the three complex structures are simultaneously integrable, there is
always a potential, but a general hkt manifold admits a potential only
under the conditions given in [31].

a general (but not most general!) set of models can be obtained from
a function l(x), where x a are coordinates on r4n, and the i r

5. the quantum mechanics of a test particle in a reissner-
nordstrom background

our goal is to apply the results on superconformal quantum mechanics to
the quantum mechanics of a collection of supersymmetric black holes. as a
warm-up in this section we consider the problem of a quantum test particle
moving in the black hole geometry. the four-dimensional case was treated
in [11], which will be followed and adapted to ve dimensions in this section.
consider a ve-dimensional extremal reissner-nordstrom black hole of

charge q. the geometry of such a black hole is described by the metric

and the gauge eld

ds2 =

|~x2| . we have set mp = lp = 1.

s = mz d + qz a.

(5.2)

12this implies that the three complex structures are simultaneously integrable. heller-
man and polchinski [32] have recently shown how to relax this limitation by generalizing
the n = 2 supereld constraints of [29, 33].

18 britto-pacumio, michelson, strominger and volovich

parametrize the particles trajectory as ~x = ~x(t). we consider a slowly
moving black hole, by which we mean | ~x|  1. placed at a xed distance
from the black hole, the test particle remains there. in this parametrization,
we can make the following substitution:

d~x = ~xdt,

which allows us to rewrite (5.1) to obtain the metric

dt2
2 + | ~x|2dt2.
now we solve the equation ds2 = d 2 and nd

ds2 = 

2| ~x|2dt + o( x4),
which is substituted into (5.2) to obtain the action,

d =

dt
 

1

s = mz (

.

for a supersymmetric test particle, m = q, this action reduces to

s =

2 z 2| ~x|2dt.

(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

(5.6)

(5.7)

if the particle is near the horizon, at distances r  q, then we can

approximate  = q

|~x|2 , so that

sp =

mq2

2 z dt| ~x|2
|~x|4 ,

(5.8)

or, if we dene a new quantity ~y = ~x
at space:

|~x|2 , then we see that we are actually in

sp =

mq2

2 z dt| ~y|2.

(5.9)

far from the black hole, spacetime and the moduli space look at once
again. thus the moduli space can be described as two asymptotically at
regions connected by a wormhole whose radius scales as q. at low ener-
gies (relative to mp/q) the wavefunctions spread out and do not t into
the wormhole. hence the quantum mechanics is described by near and far
superselection sectors that decouple completely at low energies.

scqm and multi-black hole moduli spaces

19

this geometry leads to a problem. consider the near horizon quantum
theory. given any xed energy level e, there are innitely many states of
energy less than e. this suggests that there are innitely many states of
a test particle localized near the horizon of a black hole, which appears
problematic for black hole thermodynamics. the possibility of such states
arises from the large redshift factors near the horizon of a black hole. similar
problems have been encountered in studies of ordinary quantum elds in a
black hole geometry.

the new observation of [11] is that this problem is in fact equivalent to
the problem encountered by dff [10] in their analysis of conformal quan-
tum mechanics. to see this equivalence let  denote the radial coordinate
|~y|. the hamiltonian corresponding to (5.9) is
4
2 j 2).

2mq2 (p2

(5.10)

h =

 +

this is the dff hamiltonian of (2.1) with g = 4
mq2 j 2. the coordinate 
grows innite at the horizon. thus this potential pushes a particle to the
horizon whenever j 2 is nonzero. our problem of innitely many states at
low energies is just the problem discussed by dff.

applying the dff trick, as discussed in section 2, provides the solution
to this problem. we work in terms of h +k rather than h, since the former
has a discrete spectrum of normalizable eigenstates. there is an sl(2, r)
symmetry generated by h, d and k, where d and k are dened to be

d = 1
k = 1

2 (p + p);
2 mq22.

(5.11a)

(5.11b)

these generators satisfy equations (2.3).

the appearance of the sl(2, r) symmetry was not an accident. it arises

from the geometry of our spacetime. near the horizon, we nd that

ds2

3.

(5.12)

we recognize this metric as that of ads2s3. introduce new coordinates

4r2 on ads2. now the metric can be written in the form

t = t  q

ds2

2 = 

qdt+dt

(t+  t)2 .

(5.13)

20 britto-pacumio, michelson, strominger and volovich

the sl(2, r) isometry generators are then

(5.14a)

(5.14b)

(5.14c)

here h shifts the time coordinate, and d rescales all coordinates.

the sl(2, r) symmetry of the near-horizon particle action reects the
sl(2, r) isometry group of the near-horizon ads2 geometry. as pointed out
in [11, 34], the trick of dff to replace h by h +k has a nice interpretation
in ads2. to understand it, we must rst review ads2 geometry.

interlude: ads2 geometry

on ads2, introduce global coordinates u dened in terms of the coordi-
nates of (5.13) by the relation

then the ads2 metric takes the form

t = tan u.

ds2 = 

q

du+du

in these coordinates, the global time generator is

sin2(u+  u)

.

h + k =


u+ +


u .

(5.15)

(5.16)

(5.17)

in gure 2 it is seen that the time coordinate conjugate to h is not a
good global time coordinate on ads2, but the time coordinate conjugate
to h + k is. in fact, the generators h and d preserve the horizon, while h + k
preserves the boundary u+ = u +  (the right boundary in gure 2).

so in conclusion the dff trick has a beautiful geometric interpretation
in the black hole context. it is simply a coordinate transformation to good
coordinates on ads2.

6. quantum mechanics on the black hole moduli space

6.1. the black hole moduli space metric

in this section we will consider ve-dimensional n = 1 supergravity with a
single u (1) charge coupled to the graviphoton and no vector multiplets.13

13adding neutral hypermultiplets would not aect the discussion, since they decouple.
since these lectures were given, the case with additional vector multiplets was solved

we can also get this from m-theory compactied on a calabi-yau with
b2 = 1 (the simplest example of such a threefold is the quintic). the black
holes are then m2-branes wrapping calabi-yau two-cycles.

this system has a solution describing n static extremal black holes

(cf. equation (5.1)) where  is the harmonic function on r4

(6.2a)

(6.2b)

(6.2c)

and ~xa is the r4 coordinate of the ath black hole, whose charge is qa.
another picture of these holes is m2-branes wrapping calabi-yau cycles.
the space of solutions is called the moduli space, which is parametrized by

in [35], and the four-dimensional case was solved in [23]. the supersymmetry of cases
with more than eight initial supersymmetries [36, 37] has not been worked out.

22 britto-pacumio, michelson, strominger and volovich

the 4n collective coordinates ~xa. the slow motion of such black holes is
governed by the moduli space metric gab, so that the low energy eective
action takes the form

s =

1

2 z dt xa xbgab.

(6.3)

note that due to the no-force condition there is no potential term in the
action, and since | ~xa|  1, the higher order corrections can be neglected.
the rst calculation of the moduli space metric of the four-dimensional
reissner-nordstrom black holes was performed in [3, 4] and was generalized
to dilaton black holes in [38]. the metric on the moduli space for the ve-
dimensional black holes (6.2) was derived in [14]. in order to nd this metric,
one starts with the following ansatz describing the linear order perturbation
of the black hole solution (6.2)

ds2 = 2dt2 + d~x2 + 22 ~r  d~xdt,

a = 1dt + ( ~p  1 ~r)  d~x,

(6.4a)

(6.4b)

where ~p and ~r are quantities that are rst order in velocities. in equa-
tion (6.2c), ~xa is replaced with ~xa +~vat. this is the most general galilean-
invariant ansatz to linear order. then (roughly) one uses the equations
of motion to solve for ~p and ~r. inserting this into the ve-dimensional
supergravity action gives the following result [14] for the action:

s =

and i r is a triplet of self-dual complex structures on r4 obeying equa-
tion (4.29). this lagrangian has n = 4 supersymmetry when hermitian
fermions ai = ai are added.

6.2. the near-horizon limit

6.2.1. spacetime geometry
taking the near-horizon limit of (6.2a) corresponds to neglecting the con-
stant term in (6.2c). in gure 3 we have illustrated the resultant spatial

near-horizon limit.

(a) widely separated black holes. (b) near-coincident black holes. (c) the

geometry at a moment of xed time for three black holes. before the limit
is taken (gure 3a), the geometry has an asymptotically at region at large
|~x|. near the limit (gure 3b), as the origin is approached along a spatial tra-
jectory, a single throat approximating that of a charge p qa black hole
is encountered. this throat region is an ads2  s3 geometry with radii of
order pp qa. as one moves deeper inside the throat towards the horizon,
the throat branches into smaller throats, each of which has smaller charge
and correspondingly smaller radii. eventually there are n branches with
charge qa. at the end of each of these branches is an event horizon. when
the limit is achieved (gure 3c), the asymptotically at region moves o to

innity. only the charge p qa trunk and the many branches remain.

6.2.2. moduli space geometry

it is also interesting to consider the near-horizon limit of the moduli space
geometry. the metric is again given by (6.5), where one should neglect the
constant term in the harmonic function (6.7). this is illustrated in gure 4
for the case of two black holes. near the limit there is an asymptotically at
r4n region corresponding to all n black holes being widely separated. this
is connected to the near-horizon region where the black holes are strongly
interacting, by tubelike regions which become longer and thinner as the
limit is approached. when the limit is achieved, the near-horizon region is
severed from the tubes and the asymptotically at region.

(6.9)

by splitting the potential l appearing in the metric (6.5) into pieces
representing the 1-body, 2-body and 3-body interactions, one can show [14]
that the conditions (4.34) and (4.36) are satised. thus the sl(2, r) sym-
metry can be extended to the full d(2, 1; 0) superconformal symmetry as
was described in section 4.4. this group is the special case of the d(2, 1; )
superconformal groups for which there is an su (1, 1|2) subgroup (in fact,
d(2, 1; 0) = su (1, 1|2)  su (2)), in agreement with [39].
so we have seen that there are noncompact regions of the near-horizon
moduli space corresponding to coincident black holes. these regions are
eliminated by the potential k in the modied hamiltonian l0 = 1
2 (h +k),
which is singular at the boundary of the noncompact regions. l0 has a well
dened spectrum with discrete eigenstates. a detailed description of the
quantum states of this system remains to be found [40].

7. discussion

let us recapitulate. we have found that at low energies the quantum me-
chanics of n black holes divides into superselection sectors. one sector

scqm and multi-black hole moduli spaces

25

describes the dynamics of widely separated, non-interacting black holes.
the other near horizon sector describes highly redshifted, near-coincident
black holes and has an enhanced superconformal symmetry. since they
completely decouple from widely separated black holes, states of the near
horizon theory are multi-black hole bound states.

it is instructive to compare this to an m-theoretic description of these
black holes. in calabi-yau compactication of m theory to ve dimensions,
the black holes are described by m2-branes multiply wrapped around holo-
morphic cycles of the calabi-yau. in principle all the black hole microstates
are described by quantum mechanics on the m2-brane moduli space, which
at low energies should be the dual cft1 living on the boundary of ads2
[12]. in practice so far this problem has not been tractable. this mod-
uli space has what could be called (in a slight abuse of terminology) a
higgs branch and a coulomb branch. this higgs branch is a sigma model
whose target is the moduli space of a single multiply wrapped m2-brane
worldvolume in the calabi-yau. in the coulomb branch the m2-brane has
fragmented into mulitple pieces, and the branch is parametrized by the m2-
brane locations. at nite energy the coulomb branch connects to the higgs
branch at singular points where the m2-brane worldvolume degenerates.

at rst one might think that the considerations of this paper corre-
spond to the coulomb branch, since the multi-black hole moduli space
is parametrized by the black hole locations. however it is not so simple.
the fact that the near horizon sector decouples from the sector describing
non-interacting black holes strongly suggests that it is joined to the higgs
branch. indeed in the d1/d5 black hole, there is a similar near-horizon re-
gion of the coulomb branch which is not only joined to but is in fact a dual
description of the singular regions of the higgs branch [41, 42, 43, 44, 45].
we conjecture there is a similar story here: the near-horizon, multi-black
hole quantum mechanics is dual to at least part of the higgs branch of
multiply wrapped m2-branes. near-horizon microstates should therefore
account for at least some of the internal black hole microstates. exactly
how much of the black hole microstructure is accounted for in this way
remains to be understood.

a. dierential geometry with torsion

in this appendix, we give a brief summary of dierential calculus with
torsion, for the reader who is frustrated by the usual absence of such a
discussion in most general relativity books.14 recall [47] that the covariant
derivative of a tensor is given in terms of the (not necessarily symmet-
ric) connection c c
ab is just the antisymmetric part of the
connection:

ab. the torsion cc

cc

ab  c c

[ab] = 1

2 (c c

ab  c c

ba).

(a.1)

either by direct computation, or by recalling that the dierence between
two connections is a tensor, one nds that the torsion is a true tensor. of
course, the torsion does contribute to the curvature tensor, and we remind
the reader that many of the familiar symmetries of the curvature tensor are
not obeyed in the presence of torsion. also, if the symmetric part of the
connection is given by the levi-civita connection, then the full connection
annihilates the metric i the fully covariant torsion tensor cabc = gadcd
bc is
completely antisymmetric.

hopefully, the preceding paragraph was familiar. we now discuss the
torsion in a tangent space formalism. as usual, the rst step is to dene
the vielbein e

 = 1, . . . , n, where n is the dimension of the manifold, obeying

note that equation (a.4) is valid for any choice of connection, and does
not imply that the metric is covariantly constant. the metric is covariantly
constant i  is covariantly constant, which in turn holds i the connec-
tion one-form a is antisymmetric in the tangent space indices, where
we have lowered the middle index using the tangent space metric . in
other words, the familiar antisymmetry of the connection one-form [47] ex-
ists if and only if the metric is covariantly constant, whether or not there
is torsion.
