abstract. using a supereld formulation of extended phase space, we propose a new form of the
hamiltonian action functional. a remarkable feature of this construction is that it directly leads to
the bv master action on phase space. conversely, superspace can be used to construct nilpotent
brst charges directly from solutions to the classical lagrangian master equation. we comment
on the relation between these constructions and the specic master action proposal of alexandrov,
kontsevich, schwarz and zaboronsky.

superfield brst charge and the master action

1. introduction

in two recent papers [1, 2], it has been shown that quantization, in both the hamiltonian operator
language and a phase space path integral, has an equivalent supereld formulation. the superspace
consists of ordinary time t and a new grassmann-odd direction . all original phase space coordinates
za
0 (t) are just the zero-components of super phase-space coordinates
(1)

za(t, ) = za

1 (t) .

0 (t) + za
0 (t), denoted by (za). the superspace derivative
d
d

+ 

d

,

it follows that za(t, ) has the same statistics as za

(2)

d 

replaces the ordinary time derivative. it satises

(3)

d2 =

d
dt

,

and one can indeed show that the usual heisenberg equations of motion on the original phase space
variables are obtained by applying d twice on the extended variables.

we shall here consider another extension of the usual time derivative,

(4)

d  

d
dt

,

which obviously satises d2 = 0. this derivative will turn out to play a central role in understanding
bv-quantization [3] in phase space [4]. we note that d can be assigned a denite ghost number
according to the ghost number we assign to , and we choose gh() = 1.

(5)

we now make some general observations concerning a relation between the even poisson bracket on
the original phase-space manifold and an associated (grassmann-odd) antibracket on the super path
space that can be induced by it [1, 7]:
0 (t), zb
(cid:0)za
0 (t), zb
(cid:0)za
1 (t), zb
(cid:0)za

0 (t)(cid:1) = 0
1 (t)(cid:1) = ab(z0)(t  t)
1 (t)(cid:1) = zc

1 c ab(z0)(t  t) .

where ab(z) = (cid:8)za, zb(cid:9). this antibracket obviously carries one unit of grassmann parity and one

unit of ghost number. another important property of (5) is the following: let f (z) be a function on
phase space and let the functional f be dened by

(6)

f [z] = z dtd f (z(t, )) ,

so that the grassmann parity of f is opposite that of f . then for any functions f, g on the phase
space we have

(7)

(f, g)  z dtd {f, g} .

where f, g are the corresponding functionals obtained by (6).
in particular, if a grassmann-odd
function f satises the hamiltonian master equation {f, f } = 0 then the corresponding grassmann-

even functional f = r dtd f satises the bv master equation with respect to the antibracket:

(f, f ) = 0 .

(8)

this has an obvious generalization, because even if f = f (z, t, ) is a function on the original phase
space that also explicitly depends on time t and its super-partner , and f still satises the hamiltonian

master equation {f, f } = 0 for any t and , then the corresponding functional f = r dtdf (z(t, ), t, )

also satises the master equation with respect to the antibracket (7).

see section 4 for details.

2. superfield realization of the phase space antifield formalism

let us now consider a system with rst class constraints. we thus have a grassmann-odd brst

generator  = (z) and an hamiltonian h = h(z), which are taken to satisfy

(9)

{, } = 0

and

{h, } = 0 .

they combine nicely into one grassmann-odd object q [1]

(10)

q(z, )  (z) + h(z) ,

which is nilpotent due to eq. (9):

(11)

{q, q} = 0 .

let us in addition consider the following action functional:

(12)

s[z] = z dtd [va(z(t, ))dza(t, )  q] ,

where the symplectic potential va is related to the symplectic metric ab (ac cb = b

a ) via

(13)

ab = (cid:16)avb  (1)(a)(b)bva(cid:17) (1)b .

as usual, we assume the symplectic form to be exact. we emphasize that this construction is quite
dierent from that of refs. [1, 2]. in particular, in the present formulation the superpartners z1(t)
cannot be viewed as pfaan ghosts. to construct the path integral one must thus in addition specify
the formally invariant super liouville measure, as usual. if in addition to eq. (11) we also assume
that there are no boundary terms from q

(14)

z dtd dq = z dt (z0) = 0 ,

then it follows from the previous considerations that this action satises the master equation

(15)

(s, s) = 0 .

it is simple to integrate out the additional -variable from eq. (12), and one nds:

(16)

s[z] = z dt [va(z0(t)) za

0 (t)  h(z0(t))  za

1 (t)a(z0(t))] .

except for the last term, this is simply the conventional phase-space action if there were no constraints.
let us rewrite this last term:

(17)

za
1 a(z0(t)) = z

0a{za

0 , } ,

0a  zb

where we have dened z
1 ba. this is the general phase space action extended with antields
to satisfy the classical bv master equation (s, s) = 0. note that the variables za
0a are
canonically conjugate within the antibracket, but the precise identication of which plays the role of
eld or antield becomes apparent upon identication of ghost number [4]. all these assignments
follow automatically from the supereld approach.

0 and z

to make these considerations more concrete, let us consider the case of rst class constraints t(z)
with the usual algebra

(18)

{t, t} = c 

t ,

{t, h0} = v 

 t .

where for simplicity we assume all the original phase space variables to be bosonic. according to the
bfv prescription [5] one introduces ghosts c together with their conjugate momenta p, and the
brst charge and the extended hamiltonian are then given by

 = tc

(19)

h = h0 + pv 

 c + . . .

where the dots denote the higher order terms in the expansion of  and h with respect to the ghost
momenta p. the extended poisson bracket is given in coordinates by

(20)

(cid:8)qi, pj(cid:9) = i

j ,

{c, p} = 
 .

we now allow all the phase space coordinates to depend on t and . let us write explicitly their
expansion with respect to :

(21)

qi = qi
c = c

0  pi
0  u



pi = p0
p = u

i + q
i
 + c
 .

where we have chosen some dening signs in order to facilitate comparison with the existing literature.
according to our choice gh() = 1 the ghost numbers of the new variables read

(22)

gh(qi
gh(c

gh(p0

gh(q
0) = 0 ,
0 ) = 1 , gh(u) = 0 , gh(c

i ) = 0 ,

i ) = 1 , gh(pi
) = 2 , gh(u

) = 1 ,
) = 1 .

the action (16) then takes the form

(23)

s = r dt [p0

0, t}c
i {qi

i , t}c

0 + 1

where the dots denote higher order terms in powers of u
terms in (23) are nothing but the extended hamiltonian action

{p0

0  h0 + tu  pi
0  u

0 + u c

0  u

0 c
. it is easy to see that the rst three

0 + . . . ] ,

(24)

s = z dt (p0
i qi

0  h0 + tu) ,

corresponding to the system under consideration. indeed, these terms enter only with ghost number
zero variables, and should thus be understood in the bv formalism as the initial action. making use
of the ghost number assignments (22) it is also easy to infer the gauge generators from eq. (23): they
are precisely the gauge generators of the extended hamiltonian action (24). it follows that u are
simply the lagrangian multipliers corresponding to the constraints t. all other assignments coincide
exactly with those of the extended phase space action rst identied by fisch and henneaux [4]. we
have thus explicitly conrmed the remarkable fact that the whole extended phase-space bv formalism
is precisely encoded in this superspace path integral approach.

3. an inverse construction

there are two equivalent ways two perform path integral quantization of hamiltonian systems with
rst-class constraints:

(i) via the bfv formalism based on an extended poisson bracket and brst charge .
(ii) via the bv formalism based on the antibracket and the master action corresponding to the

extended hamiltonian action.

as we have shown above, the supereld approach allows one to explicitly derive the bv formulation
from the bfv prescription on phase space. the space of eld histories (which is the bv conguration
space) thus appears as the space of super-paths of the initial bfv phase space. remarkably, this space
comes with a bv antibracket which originates directly from the bfv poisson bracket. similarly, the
master action derives directly from the brst charge  and the bfv extended hamiltonian.

it is natural to ask if there, conversely, exists a phase space description of any lagrangian gauge
theory which is dual to the standard bv description. as we shall now show, the answer to this is
armative. moreover, we will again directly arrive at the correct dual description by means of the
supereld approach. a quite dierent supereld formulation of bv lagrangian quantization was rst
proposed in ref. [6].

superfield brst charge and the master action

5

let us start with the standard bv formulation of any lagrangian gauge theory. let m be the anti-
symplectic manifold of the bv conguration space, the antisymplectic structure of which determines
the bv antibracket (, ). we let s denote the master action dened on this bv conguration space m.
this master action s is required to be of ghost number zero: gh(s) = 0, and will of course classically
satisfy the master equation (s, s) = 0. we also let a denote local coordinates on m (in darboux
coordinates a are just the elds  and antields ). in terms of local coordinates the antibracket is
determined by the odd poisson bivector eab = (a, b).

let us now turn to the supereld formulation. in this case we simply consider one odd coordinate ,
which we here take to be of opposite ghost number as compared with the previous section: gh() = 1.
we will consider  as a grassmann-odd version of ordinary time in exactly the same manner as above,
and we thus allow a to depend on , i.e.,

(25)

obviously

(26)

a = a

0 + a
1 ,

(a

0 ) = (a

1 ) + 1 = (a) ,

gh(a

0 ) = gh(a

1 )  1 = gh(a) ,

and the path space will thus have an even symplectic structure (see sec. 4). the corresponding poisson
bracket is given in coordinates by

(27)

{a
{a
{a

0 , b
0 , b
1 , b

0 } = 0
1 } = eab(0)
1 } = c

1 c eab(0) .

this poisson bracket obviously carries zero ghost number. now we dene the quantity

(28)

(0, 1)  z d s(()) ,

by construction gh() = 1, and we note that  will be nilpotent:

(29)

{, } = 0 .

in fact, this nilpotency condition is here to be viewed as a poisson-bracket master equation. but
it immediately raises the question: can this  also be formally considered as the brst charge
corresponding to a hamiltonian system with constraints? although we do not allow the elds a to
depend in addition on a new bosonic coordinate time, this is in fact the case.

it is not dicult to understand the nature of the associated hamiltonian system of constraints. let
s be the extended master action of a gauge theory described by an initial action s0(qi) and gauge
generators ri
 which we for simplicity take to be linearly independent (the discussion can be easily
generalized to the reducible case). they form a possibly open algebra

(30)

[r, r] = c 

r + . . . .

where dots means the terms vanishing on the stationary surface of the action s0. thus in the bv
formulation we need, for the minimal sector, the elds of the initial theory qi, gh(qi) = 0 (which we
for simplicity take to be bosonic), ghosts c, gh(c) = 1, and all their antields. as usual, we combine
elds into a, and antields into

we now allow a,

(33)

qi = qi

0  i ,

q
i = i + pi ,

c = c

0 +  ,

c
 =  + p .

moreover, it follows from eq. (26) that ghost number assignments are:

(34)

gh(qi

0) = gh(pi) = 0 ,

gh(c) = gh() = 1 ,

gh(p) = gh(i) = 1 ,

gh() = 2 ,

gh() = 2 .

the poisson bracket (27) becomes explicitly

(35)

0, pj} = i
{qi

0 , p} =

{i, j} = i

where dots denote higher order terms in the variables p,  and . we will see that they are to be
identied with ghost momenta. eq. (36) can formally be identied with the brst charge of a system
with constraints. using the ghost number assignments it is easy to see that i and c
0 are the ghosts
associated with rst class constraints is and piri
, and i , p are their conjugate momenta. the
variables  and  are simply the ghosts for ghosts and their momenta associated with the reducible
constraints is. to be precise, the lagrangian gauge generators ri

is no analogue of the ordinary time coordinate of the hamiltonian system.

an interesting open question concerns the role of quantum corrections to the master action s. suppose
we expand the solution to the full quantum master equation

(37)

(s, s) = is

in powers of , and insert this full solution into the denition (28). the nilpotency condition (29) will
then be broken by -corrections on the right hand side. what is the interpretation of the -corrections
to the brst charge ? perhaps this is related to canonical quantization of the poisson bracket and
the corresponding hamiltonian quantum master equation [ (), ()] = 0. in any case, the question
deserves a more detailed study.

4. geometry of the super path space

it is useful to clarify the geometrical meaning of the structures entering the above superspace formu-
lations, and view them in greater generality. in particular, it is instructive to see how the antibracket
and the usual poisson bracket enter on equal footing. in this section, which will be a bit more abstract,
we nd it convenient to even use the same symbol for the two, namely [, ]m. one must of course keep
in mind that the odd and even brackets have odd and even grassmann parities, respectively. now let
m be a symplectic manifold (which can be even or odd), and let [, ]m be the corresponding poisson
bracket or antibracket, depending on the grassmann parity. we denote by n the dimension of m and
 the grassmann parity of the bracket [, ]m, i.e.,

(38)

([f , g]m) = (f ) + (g) +  ,

the exchange relation, the leibniz rule and the jacobi identity are then neatly summarized, for both
brackets, by

(39)

[f , g]m = (1)((f )+)((g)+) [g, f ]m
[f , gh]m = [f , g]m h + (1)((f )+))(g)g [f , h]m

[f , [g, h]m ]m = [ [f , g]m , h]m + [g, [f , h]m ]m (1)((f )+)((g)+) .

superfield brst charge and the master action

for any functions f, g and h on m.

(cid:2)a, b(cid:3)m for both kinds of brackets.

in local coordinates a on m we write generically eab =

let in addition  be a supermanifold of dimension k and of coordinates xi. we assume for simplicity
that it is compact. let there in addition be a volume form d(x) = (x)dx = (x)dx1 . . . dxk on . we
denote by e the super-path space, i.e. the space of smooth maps from  to m. in local coordinates
each map is described by the functions a(x). as m is symplectic, and  has the above volume form,
then [7] the super path space e is also symplectic (see also section 4.3 of ref. [1] and ref. [8]). indeed,
for any functionals f, g we dene

(40)

[f , g]e = (1)((f )+(d))(d) z d(x)(f




a(x)

eab((x))



b(x)

g) .

here we have made use of the following conventions for the functional derivatives: for innitesimal
variation a(x) we write

(41)

f [] = z d(x)a(x)(



a(x)

f []) = z (f []




a(x)

)a(x)d(x) .

in particular, left and right derivatives are then related by

(42)



a(x)

f = (1)(d)+((f )+(d)+1)((a )+(d))f




a(x)

,

where (d) is the grassmann parity of the measure. note that the grassmann parity of the functional
derivative

a(x) is (a) + (d).



let us rst state some obvious properties of the bracket structure (40). first, the grassmann parity
k of the bracket (40) is related to the grassmann parity of the bracket [  ,  ]m by  =  + (d).
the bracket (40) obviously satises (39) with  being the  and is thus a poisson bracket or an
antibracket, depending on its grassmann parity. taking f and g in (40) to be

(43)

f [] = z d(x)f ((x)) ,

g[] = z d(x)g((x)) ,

for some functions f, g on m we arrive at

(44)

[f , g]e = z d [f , g]m .

let there in addition be given a vector eld q = qi 
xi on . we assume that divd(q) = 0, which
implies that r d qf = 0 for any function f on . the vector eld q can be lifted to a vector eld q

on the super path space e [7]. in coordinates we have for any functional f []

(45)

qf [] = z d(x)((qi(x)


xi a(x))



a(x)

f []) .

an important observation is that q is an hamiltonian vector eld with respect to the bracket (40).
indeed, let va() be the symplectic potential on m; for the symplectic 2-form we have

(46)

eab = (avb  (1)(a)(b)bva)(1)(b)(+1) ,

where  is the parity of the symplectic form. then for an arbitrary functional f [] we have

(47)

qf =  [c, f ]e ,

c = z d(x) (q a(x)) va((x)) ,

with (c) = (d)+(q)+. note that if q is an odd nilpotent vector eld on , then the corresponding
hamiltonian c automatically satises the classical master equation [c, c]e = 0. another important
property of q is that for any functional f of the form (43) we have qf =  [c, f ]e = 0.

superfield brst charge and the master action

8

these properties of the super path space bracket allows one to directly construct a bv master action

(48)

w = c + f ,

for some functional f from (43) and any f satisfying [f , f ]m = 0. this holds for arbitrary coecients
 and . when the grassmann parity of this w is odd, it simply has the interpretation as a brst-like
charge . it was shown in ref [7] that the bv master actions corresponding to chern-simons theory
and 2d topological sigma models have precisely the same structure. in all these cases one chooses 
to be an odd tangent bundle over the even manifold 0, with the odd nilpotent vector eld q being
the de rham dierential on 0. remarkably, the bv master action of the 2d poisson sigma model
used in [9] for the construction of the kontsevich star product [10] also has just the form (48).

surprising relations between the poisson brackets of hamiltonian bfv quantization and antibrackets of
lagrangian quantization have recently been discovered for topological gauge theories in a quite dierent
manner [11] (see also refs.
it would also be interesting to consider the isomorphism
between the poisson bracket and the antibracket [15] in the light of this supereld construction.

[12, 13, 14]).

finally, let us explicitly make contact to the examples we gave in the previous sections. for the rst
case we choose  to be a (1|1) supermanifold with coordinates t and . we also choose m to be
an even symplectic manifold, and simply take as measure d = dt d, as well as an odd operation
d =  d
1 . using the
representation

dt . a smooth map   m is given by the set of functions a(t, ) = a

0 + a

(49)

0 (t) = z d  a(t, ) ,
a

1 (t) = z d a(t, ) ,
a

and explicitly integrating over  in the denition (40) we arrive at

0 (t), b
(cid:0)a
0 (t), b
(cid:0)a
(cid:0)a
1 (t), b

0 (t)(cid:1) = 0
1 (t)(cid:1) = ab(0)(t  t)
1 (t)(cid:1) = c

1 c ab(0)(t  t) .

(50)

in its turn the odd nilpotent vector eld d, considered as acting on functionals, is a hamiltonian
vector eld with hamiltonian

(51)

c = z dt d vada .

choosing darboux coordinates p, q on m one arrives at the standard form r dtp0
i qi

0. thus we see that
the hamiltonian action (12) has precisely the geometrical form (48) with f being the super brst
charge  + h. the only dierence is that f in this case explicitly depends on .

in the case of the inverse construction of sec. 3 one chooses  to be a one dimensional space with
grassmann-odd coordinate  and m as an antisymplectic manifold. using the general formula (40)
one arrives directly at the explicit form of the odd path space poisson bracket (27). in this case we
simply take  = 0 and f to be the master action s in eq. (48). we have thus shown how both of
these cases follow directly from the above general framework.
