abstract

magnetic bps string solutions preserving quarter of supersymmetry are
obtained for all abelian gauged d = 5 n = 2 supergravity theories coupled to
vector supermultiplets. due to a generalised dirac quantization condition
satised by the minimized magnetic central charge, the string metric takes a
universal form for all ve dimensional gauged theories.

1 introduction

black hole solutions of gauged extended supergravities have recently been
the subject of intense research activities [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. this is largely
motivated by the newly proposed correspondence between anti-de sitter
space, the ground state of gauged supergravity, and conformal eld theo-
ries on its boundary [7]. anti-de sitter black hole solutions which break
some or all of supersymmetries may be of relevance to the proposed anti-de
sitter/conformal field theory correspondence.

bps-saturated black holes constitute a large class of non-trivial gravita-
tional backgrounds preserving some part of the superymmetry of the the-
ory. supersymmetric bps solutions for the theory of n = 2 gauged four
dimensional pure supergravity were rst considered in [1]. also, bps elec-
trically charged solutions were found for the four dimensional n = 8 and
n = 2 supergravity theories with vector multiplets in [5, 6].
in ve di-
mensional gauged n = 2 supergravity coupled to vector supermultiplets[8],
static spherically symmetric electrically charged bps-saturated black holes
were considered in [2]. a common feature of all these solutions is that they
are supersymmetric and have naked singularities. bps-saturated topologi-
cal black holes in gauged supergravity, also with naked singularities, were
obtained in [4]. non-extreme electrically charged static black hole solutions
of n = 2 ve dimensional gauged supergravities were studied in [3]. the
geometry of these solutions, in particular their singularity structure, and the
domain of the parameters of the adm mass for which horizons exist as well
as their thermodynamic features were also studied. such features could po-
tentially provide an insight into dynamics of yang-mills theories with broken
supersymmetry.

bps magnetic string solutions which break half of supersymmetry in the
theory of ungauged n = 2 ve-dimensional supergravities were constructed
in [9]. these solutions correspond , in models which can be obtained as com-
pactications of m-theory on a calabi-yau manifold, to ve branes wrapping
around the homology cycles of the calabi-yau compact space. near the hori-
zon, the supersymmetry of these solutions gets enhanced and fully restored.
the horizon geometry of these solutions is identied with the space ads3s2.
our purpose in this paper is to study spherically symmetric magnetically
charged string solutions of ve dimensional n = 2 gauged supergravity the-
ory coupled to vector supermultiplets[10]. we organize this work as follows.

in section 2, a brief review of ve dimensional n = 2 supergravity is given
within the context of very special geometry. in section 3, magnetic string
solution which preserves 1/4 of the n = 2 supersymmetry are explicitly de-
rived. it it shown that for any choice of the prepotential v which denes
the ve dimensional theory, the string metric takes a universal form inde-
pendent of the charge conguration of the solution. this universality is a
consequence of the fact that the solutions depend on the magnetic central
charge which, for the supersymmetric conguration, has to satisfy a gener-
alised dirac quantization condition. as discussed for the ungauged cases
[9], a subclass of solutions of the n = 2 models are also solutions for mod-
els with more supersymmetry; i.e., n = 4 and n = 8 supergravity. this
is the three-charge conguration with no self-intersections. the last section
includes a summary and a discussion.

2 d = 5 n = 2 gauged supergravity

the theory of ve-dimensional n = 2 supergravity coupled to abelian vector
supermultiplets can be obtained by compactifying eleven-dimensional super-
gravity, the low-energy theory of m-theory, on a calabi-yau three-folds [11].
the massless spectrum of the theory contains (h(1,1)  1) vector multiplets
with real scalar components, and thus h(1,1) vector bosons (the additional
vector boson is the graviphoton). the theory also contains h(2,1) + 1 hy-
permultiplets, where h(1,1) and h(2,1), are the calabi-yau hodge numbers.
gauged supergravity theories are obtained by gauging a subgroup of the r-
symmetry group; the automorphism group of the supersymmetry algebra.
the gauged d = 5, n = 2 supergravity theories are obtained by gauging the
u(1) subgroup of the su(2) automorphism group of the supersymmmetry
algebra [10]. this is achieved by introducing a linear combination of the
abelian vector elds already present in the ungauged theory, i.e. a = vi ai
,
with a coupling constant g. the coupling of the fermi-elds to the u(1) vec-
tor eld breaks supersymmetry, and therefore gauge-invariant g-dependent
terms must be introduced in order to preserve n = 2 supersymmetry. in a
bosonic background, this amounts to the addition of a g2-dependent scalar
potential v [10, 2].

the bosonic part of the gauged supersymmetric n = 2 lagrangian which

where i and i refer, respectively, to a partial derivative with respect to the

it is worth pointing out that for calabi-yau compactication, v repre-
sents the intersection form, x i and xi = 1
6 cij kx j x k correspond, respec-
tively, to the size of the two- and four-cycles and cij k are the intersection
numbers of the calabi-yau threefold.

3 magnetic string solutions

in this section the bps extended magnetic solutions preserving 1/4 of the
n = 2 supersymmetry are constructed. this is achieved by solving for the

4

vanishing of supersymmetry transformation of the gravitino and gauginos
elds in a bosonic background. the supersymmetry transformation of these
fermionic elds in a bosonic background are given by [2]

where  is the supersymmetry parameter and d is the covariant derivative2.
a general spherically symmetric string solution can be written in the
following form

ds2 = e2v dt2 + e2t dz2 + e2u dr2 + r2(cid:16)d2 + sin2 d2(cid:17)

and for the gauge elds we take

ai

f i

where the functions (u, v, t ) are functions of r, and (, ) are the polar
coordinates of the 2-sphere.

(12)

the last two equations in (12) implies that one should set t = v. more-

over, we make the following choice3

x ivi = 1,

(13)

then one immediately obtain from the fth equation of (12), the following
expression for u

eu =

(14)

using the last equation of (12), we obtain the following dierential equation
for v ,

v eu = g

(15)

3one could have set x i vi to an arbitrary constant but the net eect would be a rescaling

of the coupling constant g

the above dierential equation can be easily solved by noticing that it can
be rewritten in the following form

dv

where we have implicitly assumed that z takes a constant value to be deter-

(16)

the scalar elds are chosen to minimize the magnetic central charge, as
in the case of the double extreme solutions in the ungauged theory,[13, 9] i.
e.,

i(zm) = i(qixi) =

cij kx ii(x j )qk = 0.

(17)

with the above ansatz, the gaugino transformations given by

can be easily seen to vanish identically.

from (17), it follows that the critical values of x i and its dual are given

by [9]

x i =

xi =

and thus the critical value of the bps string tension is

z 3

m =

cij kqi qj qk.

(19)

(20)

using the conditions x ivi = 1 and the fourth relation of (12), one obtains

a generalised dirac quantization condition

3s 1

cij kqi qj qk =

(21)

the above condition reduces in the case of pure supergravity, i. e, for the
case where there are no vector supermultiplets and one graviphoton charge
q0, to the dirac quantization of the magnetic charge

q0 =

1
3g

.

(22)

a similar condition was obtained by [1] .

to summarize, the magnetic string solution to d = 5, n = 2 gauged

supergravity coupled to vector multiplets is given by

ds2 = (gr)

eu =

3gr

+ gr.

2 e 3

2 u (dt2 + dz2) + e2u dr2 + r2(cid:16)d2 + sin2 d2(cid:17)

and the gauge elds and the scalars are given by

ai
 = qi cos ,
x i = 3gqi.

(23)

(24)

(25)

the killing spinor is independent of the angular variables and the ra-
dial dependence of the killing spinor is obtained by solving for its radial
dierential equation given by

 r

(g

(26)

using the relation (15), the above dierential equation can be written in

the following simple form

and therefore

(cid:18)r

v (cid:19)  = 0

(r) = e

where 0 is a constant spinor satisfying the constraints

4 discussions

in this paper we have obtained explicit magnetic string solutions for all n =
2 supergravity models in ve dimensions. the magnetic charges satisfy a
generalised dirac quantization which for the case of pure supergravity implies
that the magnetic charge is xed in terms of the inverse of the coupling
constant g. a subclass of solutions of n = 2 supergravity are also solutions
of supergravity theories with n = 4 and n = 8 supersymmetries. those are
the gauged versions of the toroidal-type compactications.

the fact that the magnetic central charge, for all charge congurations,
is given in terms of the coupling constant g implies that the metric solution
takes a universal form for all gauged theories in ve dimensions.

clearly like the bps spherical electric solutions in four and ve dimen-
sional gauged supergravity theories, our magnetic string solution represent
a naked singularity. however, it was observed in [4]
that for four dimen-
sional purely magnetic solutions one can get extremal genuine black holes
with event horizons if the two sphere is replaced with the quotients of the
hyperbolic two-space h 2.
in our case, this would result in the following
solitonic solution.

ds2 = (gr)
