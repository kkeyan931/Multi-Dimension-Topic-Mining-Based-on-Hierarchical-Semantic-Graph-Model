abstract

twisted sectors solutions to the equations of motion with non-
trivial monodromies of three dimensional euclidean gravity are stud-
ied. we argue that upon quantization this new sector of the theory
provides the necessary (and no more) degrees of freedom to account
for the bekenstein-hawking entropy of three-dimensional black holes.

1 introduction

the asymptotic form of three-dimensional anti-de sitter space

ds2  r2dwd w +

dr2
r2 ,

(1)

enjoys remarkable properties. (here w is a complex coordinate related to the
spacetime real coordinates t and  by,

w =  + it.

(2)

note that we work in the euclidean sector.) the most general set of dieo-
morphism leaving (1) invariant form the conformal group in two dimensions.
this symmetry was discovered by brown and henneaux [1] more than 10
years ago, however, only recently it was realized [2] (see also [3]) that it plays
a central role in the statistical mechanical description of three dimensional
[4, 5] black holes .

1

the metric (1) is an asymptotic solution to einstein equations in three
dimensions with a negative cosmological constant  = 2/l2. the action for
three-dimensional gravity can be written in the convenient form

ic[g] =

c

24 z g(r + 2)dx3

where the constant c is the brown-henneaux central charge [1],

c =

3l
2g

,

(3)

(4)

and the coordinates x = x/l are all dimensionless. in this paper we shall
refer all constants to c.

the result discovered in [1] states that the asymptotic group of symme-
tries of (1) is the conformal group with a central charge c, where c is the
parameter appearing in the action (3). the conformal group is generated by
two copies of the virasoro algebra1,

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m +

c
12

n(n2  1)n+m,0.

(5)

the rst attempt to relate the conformal properties of asymptotic anti-
de sitter space with quantum black holes was done in [6]. it was pointed
out in that reference that the degeneracy of states treating l0 as a num-
ber operator was proportional to the black hole area but with a dier-
ent coecient. strominger [2] made the striking observation that if one re-
gards the conformal algebra as being generated by a 1+1 unitary conformal
eld theory, as suggested by the ads/cft correspondence [8, 9, 10], then
the degeneracy of states for given values of l0 and l0 is exactly equal to
the bekenstein-hawking entropy for the corresponding black hole with mass
ml = l0 + l0 + c/12 and spin j = l0  l0. (see [11] and [12] for recent
extensions of this idea to higher dimensions.)
in a purely gravitational calculation (like the one suggested in [6]), the
boundary cft is liouville theory which is a single eld and has an eective
central charge equal to one. this means that the degeneracy of states grows

as exp(2ql0/6) instead of the desired cardy form exp(2qcl0/6) (see

1 this form of the virasoro algebra is appropriated to the anti-de sitter sector with
sl(2, c) as an exact symmetry. in the black hole calculations we shall encounter a shifted
zero mode l
0 = l0c/24 appropriated to a torus whose exact symmetries are u (1)u (1)
[13].

2

[14, 24] for details of this fact).
indeed, in liouville theory, the central
charge does not count the number of elds. for example, a theory of d
free bosons have central charge d which depends on the number of elds.
accordingly, the degeneracy grows with d. on the contrary, liouville theory
is a single interacting eld. the central charge is related to the coupling not
the number of elds and thus the degeneracy does not grow with c. in order
to have the right counting one would need to have c liouville elds. this
has lead many authors to conclude that the gravitational degrees of freedom
carry only the thermodynamical aspects of the bekenstein-hawking entropy
[25, 37] (see [7] for an earlier discussion of this idea).

in this paper we will show that if one includes solutions to the equations
of motions with twisted boundary conditions (on the torus) the degener-
acy grows and provides the necessary degrees of freedom to account for the
bekenstein-hawking entropy. indeed, we will show that the conformal alge-
bra acting on the twisted sector has a central charge c/q where q  n is the
order of the twisting, and the degeneracy grows as exp(cid:16)2qql0/6(cid:17). unitary
representations for the twisted conformal algebra exist provided c/q  1 2.
thus, following [2], the sector with the maximum degeneracy, q = c, gives
the right bekenstein-hawking value. these results provide a geometrical
justication for the ideas presented in [19].

2 classical solutions in ads3 gravity

2.1 ads3 and riemann surfaces

it will be useful for our purposes to work on the plane rather than on the
cylinder. this is achieved by performing a conformal transformation which
also serves as an example to illustrate the conformal properties of (1). con-
sider the transformation from the cylinder w, w to the plane z, z via

(6)

2we exclude here minimal models because they impose a strange quantization condi-

tions on newtons constant.

3

it is direct to see that the new metric in the coordinates {z, z, r} looks, to
leading order in r, exactly like (1). this is an example of the invariance
of (1) under a nite conformal transformation. note that the coodinate r
is not invariant under the transformation. in fact, from (6) we see that r2
transforms like a primary with conformal dimension (1, 1). of course this is
necessary if one expects r2dwd w to be invariant.

it will be convenient to introduce a new radial coordinate  dened as
r = e. this change, plus the conformal transformation (6) bring (1) to the
form,

ds2  e2dzdz + d2.

(7)

the metrics (1) and (7) are actually exact solutions to the eld equations.
however, their global properties dier. the metric (1) can be put in the upper
poincare plane form by setting  = 1/r. however, due to the compact nature
of , 0   < 2, there are identications in the plane. the corresponding
solution is the vacuum black hole with m = 0 [4]. on the other hand, (7) can
also be put in the poincare form via the same radial redenition. since now
z lives in the whole plane z = x + iy, this corresponds to the anti-de sitter
solution without identications. this change in the topology occurs because
in the transition from (1) to (7) via (6) we have kept only the leading terms,
ignoring schwarztian derivative pieces which precisely map the vacuum black
hole into anti-de sitter.

we shall be interested in solutions to the equations of motion that ap-
proach (7) at   . the topology in the complex plane z is dened by the
global properties of the solutions. we shall discuss here the cases with genus
zero and one.

as it was mentioned above, in the anti-de sitter sector the ranges of the
spacetime coordinates are 0    2 and  < t <  and the points w
dene a cylinder. the conformally related set of points z dened in (6) then
give the whole complex plane, or riemann sphere, with genus zero.

in the black hole sector [4, 5], the euclidean time is a periodic coordinate
in order to avoid conical singularities, t  t + . the topology in the w plane
is then a torus with the identications w  w+2n+2m (n, m  z) where
 is related to the black hole temperature and angular velocity [26, 27]. in
the z-plane one obtains

this identication can also be introduced in the anti-de sitter sector (the
time coordinate is a global killing vector with no xed points) and leads

z  e2i z.

to thermal anti-de sitter space (tads) [33].
in three dimensions, thermal
anti-de sitter space is related to the black hole via a modular transformation
[27].

the euclidean sector of three-dimensional anti-de sitter space is partic-
ularly interesting because the mathematics of riemann surfaces is available.
one can consider generalizations of (7) on which the coordinate z is dened
on a riemann surface with genus g, and the conformal group will still act in
a natural way. the above classication of solutions can be summarized in
the table,

2d  surface

(9)

(note that in each case there may be conical or cusp singularities, if sources
are added.) strictly speaking, the only topologies consistent with the bound-
ary conditions (7) have genus zero and one. however, we shall see that admit-
ting solutions with non-trivial monodromy properties leads to higher genus
solutions, but we shall not discuss this point in any detail. to our knowledge
solutions to the euclidean equations of motion with higher genus have not
appeared in the literature. (although see [15] for a recent discussion about
solutions with higher genus in minkowskian signature.) what we need here
is not a spacetime with the topology   . those can always be dened.
what we need is a solution of the form of a solid riemann surface (like the
black hole which is a solid torus).

2.2 the solution

the general solution to the three-dimensional eld equations with the bound-
ary condition (7) has the form of a travelling wave,

ds2 = f dz2 + f dz2 +(cid:16)e2 + f f e2(cid:17) dzdz + d2,

(10)

where f = f (z) and f = f(z) are arbitrary functions of their arguments
[18]. before discussing the properties of this metric, we stress that (10) has
constant curvature as demanded by the vacuum three-dimensional einstein
equations, and for    one obtains (7) with the correct fallof behaviour
[1].

5

to prove that (10) is the most general solution we resort to the analysis
of [1]. the most general perturbation of the background metric (7) which
preserves its asymptotic structure is constructed by acting on it with the
asymptotic conformal vectors  found in [1]. these vectors depend on two
arbitrary functions, the virasoro charges t (z) and t (z), which satisfy the
virasoro algebra. acting with these vectors on (7) one produces the pieces
linear in f and f of (10) with [23]

f (z) =:

6
c

qt (z).

(11)

here c is given in (4). q is an integer which will be dened below; for the
time being it can be taken to be equal one. the same formula holds for
the anti-holomorphic side. to obtain the full exact solution (10) we simply
note that adding the term f f e2dzdz which makes (10) an exact solution
does not aect the leading and rst subleading terms, then the asymptotic
conformal properties are not modied. since three-dimensional gravity does
not have any bulk degrees of freedom, it follows that (10) is the most general
solution to the equations of motion with the boundary condition (7).

the construction of (10) by acting on (7) with the conformal generators
parallels the way one constructs representations of the virasoro algebra. the
analogue of the vacuum state |0i is the anti-de sitter background (7) which is
sl(2, c) invariant. acting on it with the conformal generators one nds the
general solution (10). the metric (10) is then a descendant of the metric
(7) which is the primary. we shall make this point precise in sec. 3.

the perturbations produced on the anti-de sitter metric (7) via conformal
transformations are necessarily local because, apart from the sl(2, c) trans-
formations for which (7) is actually invariant, all other conformal mappings
are not globally well-dened. in this sense, the metric (7) is a background
solution whose local perturbations, consistent with the equations of motion,
are described by (10).

the metric (7) is not the only solution which is globally well-dened.

there exists a continum of metrics with

qt (z) =

l0
z2 ,

(12)

where l0 = h + oscilation terms which are also globally well-dened. these
solutions represent conical singularities [28] or black holes, depending on
the values of l0 (see sec. 3.1, and [18] for the transition from (12) to a

6

3d black hole). the metrics of the form (12) with l0 = h are also good
backgrounds over which one can study perturbations. in sec. 3.1 we shall
construct these solutions and classify them according to representations of
the virasoro algebra.

before leaving this section, we note that the asymptotic conformal sym-
metries of (7) can be lifted to act on the space of solutions (10). just as the
asymptotic metric can be deform to become an exact solution by adding the
term f f, the asymptotic conformal vectors [1] can also be deform to dene
residual symmetries of the space of solutions.

let g(t, t ) the metric (10) and x = {z, z, }. there exists vector elds

,(x) depending on two arbitrary (anti-) holomorphic functions (z) ((z))
such that under the change x  x = x + (x) the metric (10) transform
as,
(13)

g(t, t ) + g = g(t + t, t +  t )

with

t = t + 2t +

c
12

3,

(14)

and c is given in (4) 3. see [18] for the explicit form of the residual conformal
vectors which, of course, coincide asymptotically with the vectors found in
[1]. this symmetry is an innite dimensional symmetry of the space of
solutions. in the language of representations of the virasoro algebra, it maps
the members of a conformal family into themselves.

since the residual symmetries of (10) are nothing but changes of coor-
dinates they can be generated by the constraints of general relativity, sup-
plemented with appropriated boundary terms.
in the gauge xed form of
the space of solutions (10), these generators are the functions t and t and
the associated algebra is the virasoro algebra [1]. in terms of the modes ln
dened in the usual way,

t (z) = xnz

ln
zn+2 ,

(15)

one obtains the algebra (5).

an important property of these transformations is that e is not a scalar.
indeed, e2 is, to leading order, a primary eld with conformal dimension

3in the twisted sector introduced below, the central term in this expression is c/q.

7

(1, 1) and hence e2dzdz is invariant. this also explains the presence of
the term e2t t in the solution (10). since t and t are quasi-primaries
with conformal dimensions (2, 0) and (0, 2) respectively, the product t t has
dimension (2, 2). the combination e2t t then has dimension (1, 1), as
needed.

2.3 the twisted sector

motivated by the problem of black hole entropy lack of enough states
to account for the large black hole degeneracy, see [24, 25, 18] for recent
discussions our goal in this section is to generalize the space of solutions
described in the last section.

since in two dimensions the rotation group does not restrict the spins to
be integer or half integer, it is natural to consider anyonic perturbations
of the background metric with a fractional spin under z  e2iz. we shall
see that unitarity restricts the posible twistings (spins) leaving just enough
new states to account for the bekenstein-hawking entropy. in sec. 4.3, we
shall argue that in a chern-simons formulation the twisted solutions are
completely natural.

we consider again the solution (10) with a mode expansion for t (z)
having fractional powers of z. let q be a non-negative integer (q  1), which
will be called the order of the twisting. we give up the expansion (15) and
dene instead,

t (z) =

1
q

q1

xr=0 xmz

lm+r/q
zn+r/q+2 .

(16)

the relation between t and f is given in (11). the factors q and 1/q appear-
ing in (11) and (16) are conventional and are included for future convenience.
the stress tensor t is then a sum of elds with denite monodromies. similar
formulae are assumed for the anti-holomorphic factor.

the metric (10) is still an exact solution because the eld equations only
see the local properties. for the same reason, the modes lm+r/q satisfy the
same virasoro algebra (5), but now the label n in (5) takes values on z +r/q.
one nds the twisted virasoro algebra 4,

[ln+r/q, lm+s/q] = (n  m + (r  s)/q)ln+m+(r+s)/q

4this algebra has appeared in [32] in the context of cyclic orbifolds [34].

8

+

c
12

(n + r/q)[(n + r/q)2  1]n+m+(r+s)/q.

(17)

note that the modes ln+r/q are dened such that 0  r < q. the algebra
(17) should be understood with the periodicity and reality conditions

ln+(r+q)/q = ln+1+r/q,

lnr/q = ln1+(qr)/q,
l

n+r/q = lnr/q

(18)
(19)

(20)

the algebra (17) has a virasoro sub-algebra (for r = 0) generating the single-
valued conformal transformations of z with central charge c. it is clear that
this sub-algebra is isomorphic to the brown-henneaux generators ln acting
on the single valued, or untwisted, sector. the stress tensor t (z) is a nite
sum of the form

qt (z) = t0(z) + t1(z) +    + tq1(z)

(21)

where tr(e2iz) = e2ir/qtr(z)5. clearly t0(z) corresponds to the untwisted
solution.

there is an important point here concerning the value of the central
charge appearing in (17). if one computes the algebra, or ope of the function
t (z) dened in (16) using (17), one nds a central charge c/q. this is not
incorrect. the function t (z) contains all sectors tr(z), r = 0, 1, .., q  1. it
is the zero monodromy generator t0(z) what needs to be matched with the
brown-henneaux one, not the full t (z). t0(z) denes a subalgebra of the
full t (z) and satisfy the virasoro algebra with central charge c, as desired.
this point will have an important consequence below.

the perturbed metric (10), for a general t , is no longer periodic under
z  e2iz. for the purposes of this paper, this classical non-periodicity will

5 note that tr can be expressed in terms of t as,

tr(z) =

xs=0

t (e2s)e2isr/q,

and the modes ln+r/q are expressed in terms of tr as,

ln+r/q =i dz

be of no importance because, as we discussed above, the only globally dened
metrics are those of the form (12), for some value of l0. l0 is made up of
periodic and non-periodic perturbations, but the observable globally dened
metric will be periodic (see next section).

3 quantization.

3.1 the spectrum. quantum mechanics

the space of solution described by metrics of the form (10) is innite dimen-
sional, and so far, completely disorganized. any function f (z), f (z) = z3 or
f (z) = 1/z for example, provides a solution and there is no way to predeter-
mine their physical properties.

since there exists a virasoro symmetry acting on (10) mapping solutions
into solutions, one can classify the solutions using the representations of the
virasoro algebra. in particular, this will enable us to select the physically
reasonable ones, e.g., with positive energy.

candidate to represent this state.

first of all we need to identify the vacuum state |0i. there is a unique
as we mentioned in sec. 2.1, the metric (7) is an exact solution to the
eld equations. in fact, it represents euclidean anti-de sitter space. this
can be seen by setting z = x + iy and e = 1/ which maps (7) into the full
upper poincare plane (without identications). the metric (7) is invariant
under global sl(2, c) transformations, and is a particular case of (10) on
which t and t are equal to zero. we are then led to the identication,

|0i  e2dzdz + d2.

(24)

the next step is to identify the primaries from which all other repre-

sentations will be constructed.

let the metric (10) with qt = h/z2 and q t = h/z2, where h and h are
positive real numbers. we denote this metric as ds2(h, h) and identify it as
a primary eld with conformal dimensions h and h,

|h, hi  ds2(h, h).

(25)

the metrics ds2(h, h) are isometric to black holes or conical singulari-
ties, depending on the values of h and h [18].
in other words, the three-
dimensional topologies associated to ds2(h, h) depend on the values of h and

10

h. in complete analogy with liouville theory, the conformal dimensions of
the primaries h and h are separated in various sectors:

h = h = 0
0 < h + h < c/12,
h = h = c/24
h + h > c/12,

anti-de sitter space
conical singularities
vacuum black hole
black holes

(26)

having dened the primaries, a full representation is constructed by acting
with the conformal generators.

the above construction can be summarized and completed by the single

formula

t(z) = h| t (z)|i

(27)

where we identify the function t (z) appearing in (10) with the expectation
value of the quantized operator t on a given state |i; t (z) = t(z). in
other words, instead of considering (10) with arbitrary values for t (z), we
consider only those functions t(z) which are the expectation values of the
quantised t (z) on some state |i. this still leaves an innite dimensional
space of solutions, but they are now nicely organized according the the repre-
sentations of the virasoro algebra. in particular, if we only consider unitary
representations, positivity of the adm mass is guaranteed.

note that since conformal transformations acting on the state |i pro-
duce conformal transformations on t(z) of the form (14), the identication
(27) implements correctly the mapping of solutions into solutions via (14).
indeed, consider an innitesimal conformal transformation z  z + (z).
this transformation has an associated group element u = 1 + ih (z)t (z)
acting on the representation space: |i  |i = u|i. it is direct to see
that the eect of this transformation on t is exactly equivalent to (14).
the map (27) can be extended to the full metric. to each state in fock
space |i there is a corresponding solution to the equations of motion [18],
(28)

ds2

 = h|ds2|i,

where ds2 is the metric (10) on which t and t have been replaced by their
quantized versions t and t . note that the metric (10) does not involve prod-
ucts of non-commuting operators 6 and thus is well-dened as an operator.

6this property will not survive in a full gauge invariant quantization. note, how-
ever, that in a chern-simons formulation one would need to regulate at most a quadratic
function of the currents (sugawara type).

11

let us now study the eect of the twisting on the quantum metric. from

the algebra (17) it is direct to prove the identity,

e(n+r/q)ln+r/q = el0ln+r/q el0,

(29)

where  is a complex number. using this formula with  = 2i one can
check that t (z) given in (16) transforms as,

t (e2iz)dz2 = a t (z)dz2 a1,

where a = e2il0 is the generator of the cycle,

z  e2iz,

(30)

(31)

acting on fock space. in this sense the metric (10) as an operator is perfectly
well-dened. the classical t(z) transforms as

t(e2iz) = t(z)

(32)

where  is the transported state |i = e2il0|i.
at this point we notice a correspondence between the globally well-dened
metrics (12), and states in the verma module. the states in the verma
module are by denition those for which l0 is diagonal. in that case, the
monodromy matrix a is diagonal and the state transforms under (31) by a
phase not seen by any observer. in particular, the classical t(z) is invariant:
if  is an state in the verma module vc one has

t(e2iz) = t(z),

  vc

(33)

the metrics associated to these states are periodic globally well-dened met-
rics of the form (12). (the periodicity follows from the fact that for states
  vc, hln+r/qi  l0 and l0dz2/z2 is invariant under (31).)

3.2 the torus (periodic time) and statistical mechanics

we have formulated the theory in the euclidean formalism because our nal
target is the statistical mechanics of black holes. the black holes represen-
tations with h + h > c/12 are particularly suited for this goal because the
associated geometries have the topology of a solid torus with a compact time
direction. we dene the torus as the complex plane with the identications

z  e2i z,

12

(34)

where  is a complex parameter (with im( ) > 0) which denes the complex
structure and is related to the black hole temperature and angular velocity
[26, 27].

the virasoro character on a given representation h is

ch(h,  ) = trhe2i (l0c/24) = xl

0

h(l

0)e2i l

0

(35)

where (l
eigenvalue l

0) is the number of states in the representation with the given
0 = l0  c/24. see footnote 1 for the meaning of l
0.

the statistical mechanics description of three-dimensional black holes

which follows from the above analysis is the following.

we pick up a representation labeled by a primary h (we omit in the follow-
ing the anti-holomorphic labels). this means that we choose a background
metric ds2(h) of the form (12). the full representation, which we interpreted
as the space of all positive energy perturbations of the background metric,
is innite dimensional and is represented by the metrics (10), where t (z) is
constructed as explained in the last section. we now project to the space of
states for which l0 is diagonal, and count the number of them compatible
with a given value of l0.

the space of states which diagonalize l0 are those in the verma module.
these states have the extra properties that the associated classical metric,
through (28), is univalued and isometric to a black hole [18] with a mass and
spin given by

(36)

m = l

0 + l
0,

j = l

0  l
0.

as it is well know, the untwisted sector is not powerful enough to give
the desired bekenstein-hawking entropy [24]. we shall count the number of
states in the twisted sector in next section and prove that it gives exactly
the right number.

3.3 counting black hole states

let us count the number of states compatible with a given value of l0 in
a representation created by a primary |hi. since we are interested in the
microscopic structure of black holes, we take as primary state the vacuum
black hole with h = h = c/24 7.

7there is a subtle issue here because the vacuum black hole does not have the same
topology as the massive black hole. we shall imagine that the primary is arbitrarily close

13

the algebra (17) is isomorphic to another non-twisted virasoro algebra
which will appear below. however, we shall count states directly in (17)
because it exhibits clearly where do the extra states come from.

for h = c/24 and c > 1 (and q  c, see below), the representation are

unitary and irreducible. the excited levels are given by the states

|{n, r}i = ln1+r1/q    lns+rs/q|c/24i

(37)
where ni = 1, 2, 3, ... and ri = 0, 1, 2, ..., q  1. as mentioned above, these
states satisfy,
(38)

n0
h{n, r}|ln+q/r|{n, r}i = 0

which means that the associated metrics are periodic and globally dened.

r l0,

from (17), we deduce that l0 is a number operator and its value on the

state |{n, r}i is given by,
l
0 := l0 

c
24

=

s

xi=1
(ni  ri/q).

(39)

note that since we take the vacuum black hole as background metric with
h = c/24, there is a direct relation between the excited levels and l
0 which
is the quantity related directly to the black hole mass and spin, as in (36),
with no added constants.

the sum over ni in (39) is the contribution from the untwisted sector
which we know does not give the right degeneracy. the second piece ri/q
provides a hyperne structure which increases the degeneracy.
if q was
arbitrary, this method could yield an innite degeneracy which would not be
correct. we shall see below that unitarity put a constraint on the possible
values of q leaving just enough new states to account for the bekenstein-
hawking entropy.

multiplying eq. (39) by q, we see that the number of states compatible
with l0 is given by the number of combinations of the pair {ni, ri} such that,
(40)

with

ql

mi,

mi = qni  ri.

0 = xi

in what follows, the following (trivial) lemma will be of great help. let

n  z and 0  r < q:

the map: {n, r}  m = qn  r
is one to one (and invertible).

(41)

to be a vacuum black hole, but its topology will be that of a massive black hole: a solid
torus. in particular, the boundary described by the coordinate z is a torus.

14

given any m  z there exists a unique pair {n, r} such that m = qn  r.
then, it follows that all posible combinations of {ni, ri} give all possible
positive integers mi once. the problem of how many states varying ni and
ri can exist for a given l
0, can then be formulated as the number of ways
that the integer ql
0 can be written as a sum of integers mi. this is of course
given by the ramanujan formula,

  e2ql

0/6,

(42)

which is valid for large values of ql
0. note the factor of q multiplying l
0.
since q is an integer greater than one, the degeneracy has certainly grown
with respect to the pure liouville calculation which has an aective central
charge equal to one.

the key step in this counting is that even though l

0 is not an integer,
0 is. from the point of view of the characters, the above

the combination ql
counting can be done again by noticing

tr e2i (l0c/24) = tr e2i( /q)ql

n=1(1  zn)1 (43)
where p(m) are the partitions of the integer m and z = e2i /q. this leads
directly to (42), and provides a geometrical justication for the ideas sug-
gested in [19].

p(m)e2i( /q)m = 

0 = xm

if we choose q = c, then (42) gives the expected value for the black hole
entropy [2]. thus, in principle, we have enough states. this is certainly not
satisfactory. we would like to prove that q must not exceed c. we shall
now argue that for generic values of the newtons constant g (or the brown-
henneaux central charge c) unitarity in the representations of the algebra
(17) restricts the possible twistings and q must indeed lie in the range,

thus, q = c is the sector with the maximum degeneracy and yield the correct
bekenstein-hawking value.

1  q  c.

(44)

this condition arises from a re-ordering of the generators ln+r/q  qm

(m  z) given by,

ln+r/q =

1
q

qqn+r.

(45)

this is a purely algebraic step. we choose to enumerate the ls by integers
subscripts according to (45). a geometrical interpretation for the qs (on
the sphere) will be given in next section.

15

in view of (41), it is evident that the map (45) is one to one. the set
of all qn with n  z contains all ln+r/q and viceversa. some examples of
the above transformation are: q0 = ql0, q1 = ql1/q, qq = ql1, etc. the
transformation (45) is a particular case of a general procedure studied in [32].
the algebra of the modes qn can be computed directly from the knowl-

edge of the algebra of ln+r/q (see (17)) and yields

[qn, qm] = (n  m)qn+m +

c/q
12

n(n2  q2)n+m.

(46)

this algebra, up to a shift in the zero mode q0 that we discuss below, is a
virasoro algebra with central charge c/q. this means that instead of studying
representations of the complicated algebra (17) we can use (46). of course
the number of states (42) does not change.

it should now be clear where does condition (44) comes from. since c
takes generically arbitrary real, or perhaps integer, values and q is a positive
integer, unitary representation for (46) will exist only for c/q  1 which leads
to (44). we exclude here the range c/q < 1 (minimal models) because uni-
tarity would imply a strange quantization condition for newtons constant.
this is an interesting possibility which deserves special attention, but will
not be considered here.

the form of the central term in (46) may seem strange. however, note
that the transformation (45) maps the sl(2,) subalgebra l0, l1 into
q0, qq. this shift in the central term has actually an interesting conse-
quence.

let us shift q0 such that the central term in (46) acquires the usual form
with q0, q1 generating an sl(2,) algebra. this is achieved by redening
the new qnew

4 remarks

we have exhibit in this note a set of solutions to the vacuum einstein equa-
tions which upon quantization yield the correct bekenstein-hawking entropy.
in order to have a complete picture of the hawking evaporation process, we
should consider also transitions between states i.e., emissions of states via
vertex operators. this type of process will certainly need other correlation
functions beyond the partition function. we shall not consider this problem
here. however, we would like to end by making a number of remarks which
hopefully will clarify the nature of the solutions that we have presented (at
least on the sphere), and may be the starting point towards a dynamical
modeling of the evaporation process in 2+1 dimensions.

in particular, in section 4.3, we shall argue that the multivalued solutions
twisted sector arise in a natural way within the chern-simons formulation
of three-dimensional gravity.

4.1 the conformal algebra in the covering space

working with multivalued functions is often problematic and thus it is conve-
nient to pass to the covering space on which the stress tensor is single valued.
it is well-known in the theory of complex variables that for any multivalued
function of a complex coordinate z, there exists a covering surface for which
the given function is single valued. in our case this covering is simply given
by the equation

z = uq.

(49)

this transformation map the riemann sphere (ads3) into itself (up to two
singularities in the north and south poles where (49) has xed points). for the
torus, this transformation changes the genus [30]. since we do not have much
control on the three-dimensional solutions with higher genus 2d-boundaries,
we shall restrict ourselves in this section to the genus zero situation.

we consider the metric (10) with f and f given in (11) and t in (16).
let us transform this metric with (49). two clarications are necessary here.
first, we shall only transform the complex coordinate z, not the radial co-
ordinate. this means that this transformation is not one of the residual
transformations mentioned before and we will obtain a dierent metric. we
could modify (49) including a radial dependence plus adding the correspond-
ing transformations for  and obtain the same metric dened on the covering

17

space. for our purposes here this is not necessary and would bring unneces-
sary complications. second, we shall treat t classically and therefore we do
not include any schwarztian derivative terms. of course, if we did include the
radial reparametrization, there would be the classical schwarztian derivative
piece.

so, we simply plug (49) into (10) and nd the new metric

ds2 = f du2 + f du2 + q2|u|2q2 e2 +

f fe2

q2|u|2q2! dudu + d2

with

f (u) =

6q
c

q(u).

(50)

(51)

a similar formula is valid for the anti-holomorphic side. the eld q is simply
the conformally transformed version of t under (49),

t (uq)

u!2
q(u) =   z
=: xnz

qn
un+2

and is single valued. the modes qn are related to the modes of t as 8

ln+r/q =

1
q

qqn+r.

(52)

(53)

these are exactly the generators introduced in sec. 3 (see eq. (45)) which
satisfy the virasoro algebra (46) with central charge c/q . in this context
they appear as generators of the conformal symmetry acting on the covering
space.

the metric (50) is an exact solution to the equations of motion and it is
single-valued. however, it does not satisfy the boundary conditions (7). we
shall see in sec. 4.3 that working in the chern-simons formulation one can
easily deal with metrics of the form (50).

8here we have used the monodromy decomposition:

cn
xn/q =

xnz

q1

xr=0 xmz

cmq+r
xm+r/q .

18

how do we recover from (46), the original brown-henneaux algebra? the

virasoro algebra (46) has the symmetry

qn  e2in/qqn.

(54)

it is direct to see that the subalgebra of the qs invariant under (54) is
generated by the subset of generators

ln =

1
q

qqn

(55)

and have central charge c. the sub-algebra spanned by the lns generates
the single-valued conformal transformations acting on z = uq. thus, they
correspond to the brown-henneaux generators.

this can also be seen as follows. we start with (52) and act on this

operator with the transformation (54),

qn

q(u)du2 = x

un+2 du2  x

thus, (54) act on the plane u as

e2in/qqn

un+2

du2 = q(e2i/qu)du2

(56)

and the invariant coordinate is, as expected, z = uq.

u  e2i/qu,

(57)

4.2 the action in the covering space

we have considered twisted solutions to the equations of motion associated
to the action (3), with the boundary condition (7). as shown in the last
section, instead of working with a multivalued function t , one can work
with a single valued function dened on a dierent space. in this section we
study the action on that space. this shed some light on the reduction in the
central charge in the covering space algebra. due to conformal invariance,
the action in the covering space has the same local form as the action in the
original space. however, since the plane u covers q times the original plane
z, the coupling constant in the covering manifold is c/q instead of c.

this can be summarised in the following table.

physical spacetime: z covering: u = z1/q

c

24 zz
(r + 2)

{ln+r/q, c}

19

c/q

24 zu
(r + 2)

{qn,

c
q}

(58)

it is useful to read this table backwards, from right to left. if we restrict the
action in the covering space to the space of functions invariant under (57) it
reduces to an action of single valued functions with coupling c (recall that
the sphere u covers q times the sphere z). this is our starting point and
shows that the coupling c/q in the upper right corner is correct. in the same
way, as showed in the last section, the generators qn acting on the invariant
subspace reduce to the lns (r = 0).

this analysis posses the question of what is the coupling constant of
general relativity. in principle, the action in the plane z is not preferable in
any form with respect to the action in the plane u. we could then argue that
c/q should be related to newtons instead of c. the answer to this ambiguity,
as in four dimensional gravity, is found in the boundary conditions. we dene
the action in the plane z with the boundary conditions (7) as the physical
action. the transformation (49) is not local and thus change the coupling.
we shall come back to this point in the next paragraph.

4.3 chern-simons formulation and the value of the

coupling

the chern-simons formulation provides a natural motivation to look for
multivalued solutions to the equations of motion. putting the argument the
other way around, within the chern-simons formulation, the most natural
solution to the equations of motion is (50), of which (10) is only a particular
case. thus, when making the conformal transformation (49) that brings (50)
to the asymptotic form (7), one nds the multi-valued solutions introduced
above.

we consider here euclidean three-dimensional gravity formulated as a
chern-simons theory [16, 17] for the group sl(2, c). the level of the chern-
simons theory will be xed below.

the chern-simons action appropriated to the black hole problem is the

covariant one [26, 20] supplemented by the chiral boundary conditions,

aa

z = 0,

aa

z = 0.

(59)

recall that aa = wa + iea. at the boundary, the real and imaginary parts of
aa are linked by (59). the non-zero components az and az can be written
as [18],

aa

z = 2wa
z ,

aa

z = 2wa
z .

(60)

20

thus, (59) reduces the sl(2, c) gauge eld at the boundary to two real
currents aa

z satisfying the ane su(2) algebra at level k.

z and aa

conditions (59) are not enough to ensure anti-de sitter asymptotics [31].
let {a+, a, a3} and { a+, a, a3} the components of the su(2)k  su(2)k
ane currents at the boundary (we omit here the subscripts z and z). to
ensure that the associated metric is asymptotically anti-de sitter, as in (7),
the boundary conditions (59) must be supplemented with the reduction con-
ditions [31] (see [22] for a dierent approach)

a+ = 1,
a3 = 0,

a = 1,
a3 = 0.

(61)
(62)

this leaves only l := a/k and l := a+/k as arbitrary functions. it follows
[21] that the ane su(2)k algebra reduced by (61) and (62) yields for l and
l the virasoro algebra with central charge9 c = 6k.
identifying the level
k with the usual value k = l/4g yields c = 3l/2g and conrms that the
generators l = a/k and l = a+/k are the brown-henneaux ones.

as a motivation to a more general situation consider imposing only (62).
the leading piece in the metric with these boundary conditions is easily
computed and yields,

ds2  e2a+(u) a(u)dudu + d2.

(63)

it is clear that further restricting the gauge eld with (61) leads to (7).
however, if we keep them as arbitrary, but xed, functions we discover that
(63) is precisely the asymptotic behaviour of (50) with

a+ = quq1,

a = quq1

(64)

thus, the chern-simons formulation leads to (50) in natural way.

it should be clear that, from the point of view of the chern-simons for-
mulation, there is no a priori reason to select the boundary (7) instead of
(63). the non trivial point is that in the transition from (63) to (7) via
z = uq, we have kept the twisted states, i.e., all branches of z1/q, by letting
t (z) to be a multivalued function. this is the step that follows naturally
9in [18], the central charge was written as c = 6k. this sign can be changed by
a dierent orientation for the modes. note that the virasoro algebra is invariant under
ln  ln and c  c. the following discussion is only a qualitative analysis and this
sign is irrelevant.

21

in the chern-simons formulation because there is no reason a priori to set
q = 1 in (64). the multivaluedness of t (z) is then a simple consequence of
the more general boundary conditions in the covering space.

the next question is what is the algebra leaving (63) invariant. as a
direct generalization of the above case, one can prove that the restriction of
the ane su(2)k algebra via (62) and (64) lead for the combination q(u) :=
(1/k)a+a = (q/k)uq1a(u) the virasoro algebra with a central charge
c = 6k. in this case, however, it is not correct to identify q with the original
brown-henneaux generators l, nor the central term 6k with the central
charge (4). the generators q are the operators introduced in sec. (4.1),
acting on the covering space with central charge c/q, and leave invariant the
generalized boundary conditions (63). we are then led to identify the level
k as,

6kq = c =

3l
2g

(65)

in order to match the center of the algebra (46). note also that this is in
agreement with (58). the above chern-simons theory, with the boundary
conditions (63), is appropriated to the action in the covering space with
coupling k = c/6q.

this issue brings in a problem of interpretation for the calculations of par-
titions functions that have been done using the chern-simons formulation,
and its connection to chiral wzw models[35, 26]. the main assumption on
this type of calculation is to quantize the full gauge eld aa without imposing
and kind of reduction conditions. however, as we have emphasized above,
the values of a+ and a change the global properties of the spacetime. the
coupling k is not only related to newtons constant but also to the wrapping
of the cover space into spacetime.

there is another curious consequence of (65). when quantising a string
theory on the ads3 background, a formula can be given for the spacetime
conformal generators [37]. the associated central charge is c = 6kstp where
kst = l2/l2
st is the coupling of the sl(2,) wzw model, p is the winding
number of the spacetime coordinate x() in the worldsheet, and lst is the
string length. newtons constant g3 was associated in [37] to the winding
number p via

6kstp =

.

(66)

3l
2g3

the similarity between (65) and (66) makes it tempting to identify k  kst
and q  p. this amounts to identify the black hole boundary coordinate

22

z(u) with the string worldsheet coordinate x() (compactied on a circle),
i.e., treating the covering coordinate as a string worldsheet. the fact that in
the quantum gravity approach one quantizes functions of z and thus it cor-
responds to string eld theory has recently been discussed in [38]. further,
we note that in the sector with the maximum degeneracy c = q (see sec. 3),
k is of the order of one which is also the value of kst is one expects the corre-
spondence principle [29] between black holes and string states [36] to work in
three dimensions. finally, the degrees of freedom of three-dimensional grav-
ity, as formulated in [31], are described by a (constrained) non-chiral sl(2,)
wzw model at level k. following this line of reasoning, it would be nice to
see an explicit connection between the counting presented in section 3, and
the string theory approach to black holes.
