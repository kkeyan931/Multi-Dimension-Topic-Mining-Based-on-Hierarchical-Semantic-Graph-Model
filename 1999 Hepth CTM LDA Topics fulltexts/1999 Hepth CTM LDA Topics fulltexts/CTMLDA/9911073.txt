(2) work subspace conserved currents, gauge xing necessary. 2-form propagator, g; bitensor, explained {$9902042$}, expressed combination 2 bitensors: 1 ; = u u uu 2 ; = uu u uuu uu u + uuu nevertheless, advantageous decompose g; = 1 ; g2(u) + dv; dv; , (3) (4) second part gauge artifact. upon using equations motion, involve 2 covariant derivatives applied combinations g; s, nd equation motion obeyed g2 equating scalar coecients multiplying 1 2. use formulas appendix. contractions two covariant derivatives formulas allow us do, give us extra factors multiplying g derivatives. nevertheless, one contraction per term, thus extra factors equation g2 linear d. obtain equation hypergeometric form, whose solution easily found. 2 iii. tensor structures p-form propagators similarly 2-form, 3 form propagator g; antisymmetric primed unprimed indices, expressed sum 2 bitensors similar 1 2 multiplied functions u. nevertheless, convenient combine 2 bitensors gauge invariant part gauge artifact: g; = (1)3g3(u) + d; , (5) square brackets denote antisymmetrization, (1)3 put outset 1 (a1), j; bitensor antisymmetric primed unprimed indices . generalizing higher form propagators obvious. gauge invariant part form: ginvariant 1...p; 1... p = (1)pgp(u). (6) problem reduces therefore nding functions gp appearing propagators. {$9902042$} know equations satised g0, g1 g2 u 6= 0 are: u(2 + u)g 0 + (d + 1)(1 + u)g 0 + 0(d 0)g0 = 0, u(2 + u)g u(2 + u)g 1 + (d + 1)(1 + u)g 2 + (d + 1)(1 + u)g 1 + 1(d 1)g1 = 0, 2 + 2(d 2)g2 = 0, (7a) (7b) (7c) arranged last term knowing advance equation gp look like. another function term right hand side, insures use solution (7a,b,c) diverges u 0, gives appropriate normalization solution. discussing chapter vi. use poincare duality obtain relations gp g0, g1 g2. iv. poincare duality d+1 dimensions euclidean signature, p form eld poincare dual dp1 form eld relation f1...p+112...d+1 = i(p + 1)! f p+2...d+1, (8) f eld strengths. thus 1... hf1...p+1(z)f p+1(w)i12...d+1 d+1(w)i.

(10) since ( w0 z0 + z0 w0 ) change u constant vice versa, (10) implies: (2u + 2)h p + dh p = h 0 (u2 + 2u + 2) + h 0(u + 1) combining (12),(11), equation g0 (7a) h0 also satises, obtain: h 0 (1 + u) + h 0 = h p = p + 1. (11) (12) (13a) h 0(1 + u) = h p = p + 1. case 1 form 2 form compare hfz0zifz counterparts (9). obtain similar steps 0z i, respectively hfz0zizj fz 0z iz j h 1(1 + u) + h1 = h p = p + 2, h 2(1 + u) + 2h2 = h p = p + 3. (13b) (13c) equations enables us nd propagator equations. v. p-form propagator equations rst examine 3-form propagator. using (13a,b,c) combining (7a,b,c) nd equations g3 satises d=4,5 6, u 6= 0 u(2 + u)g 3 + 5(1 + u)g 3 + 3g3 = 0 = 4 u(2 + u)g u(2 + u)g 3 + 6(1 + u)g 3 + 7(1 + u)g 3 + 6g3 = 0 = 5 3 + 9g3 = 0 = 6. (14a) (14b) (14c) precise, (14a,b,c) actually equations satised h3 dimensions. one legitimate objection one may - equations ones satised g3, equations satised particular combinations solutions 4 respect poincare duality. appendix ii address objection show equations indeed ones satised g3. based arguments presented dimension enters equation gp linearly, equation g3 satises is: u(2 + u)g 3 + (d + 1)g 3 + 3(d 3)g3 = 0. (15) use procedure p-form = p + 1, = p + 2 = p + 3, nd equation gp be: u(2 + u)g p + (d + 1)(1 + u)g p + p(d p)gp = 0. (16) reduces (7a,b,c) 0,1 2 forms. equation easy nd propagators. check whether propagator equations correct using poincare duality 3 form eld higher 4 form eld adsd+1. equations propagators found using slick argument, cranking i, large number terms equation motion. comparing hfz0zizjzk fz counterpart (9) obtain: j z k 0z iz (1 + u)h 3 + 3h3 = h p = p + 4. (17) easy check using (17) equation (15) g3 obtain equation (16) gd4. thus, approach consistent. now, look relations derived poincare duality hp h0, h1, h2 h3 (11a,b,c,16), impossible observe pattern. namely (1 + u)h q + qhq = h p = p + q + 1. (18) check guess plugging equation gp obtaining equation gq, vice versa. see, uncovered whole structure relations propagator equations poincare duality formulas. vi. propagators f4 = 1 udp 6= 2p, f3 = 1 , equation (16) second order hypergeometric dierential equation, 2 solu- . u solutions go tions. near u = 0 solutions go f1 = c, f3 = 1 . discussed, , chapter iii, another function term (7a,b,c), comes equations p (equation (6) {$9910059$} 2 form, equation (2.5) {$9902042$} 1 form). g1...p; see case general form function appears equation g1...p; p multiplying antisymmetrized product metrics, sign opposite sign u(u + 2)g p. f4 = log u f2 = 1 1... 1... d1 2 u expect physical solution one diverges origin function source. moreover, since ads impose boundary condition solution decays fastest u . 5 using hypergeometric functionology, see solution decays fastest diverges origin, one constant origin decays slowest . thus, solution decays slowest u excluded. 2 dierent cases, based relation p. 1 < 2p solution hypergeometric function: gp = ((d 1)/2) 4(d+1)/2u d1 2 c f ( 2p+1d 2 , 1 + p d, 2p + 1 d, (2 + u) 2p+1d 2 2 2+u ) , (19) c constant normalizes second fraction 1 u 0. rst fraction normalization constant takes care function discussed above. hy- pergeometric function third coecient negative, simplied rational function. + 1 > 2p solution also hypergeometric: gp = ((d 1)/2) 4(d+1)/2u d1 2 c f ( d+12p 2 , 1 p, + 1 2p, (2 + u) d+12p 2 2 2+u ) , (20) c constant similar previous case. solution also simplied rational function. ranges validity overlap = 2p, solutions also overlap. promised, come back invariance boundary conditions poincare duality. equation (18) obeyed solutions p > q (it easy see looking behavior ). equation (18) obtained contracting tensor indices p-form propagator dierent z0. therefore conclude boundary conditions components higher form eld strength contain z0 dual boundary conditions components lower form eld strength contain z0. vii. massive case easy generalize results (19,20) case massive form eld. adding mass term p-form action spoils gauge invariance. thus, cannot add equation propagator (b1) terms cancel integrated covariantly conserved current. tensorial structure (4,5) propagator changed adding mass term. p - antisym- changes second part propagator ( d; metrized covariant derivative acting (p, p 1) antisymmetric bitensor) longer interpreted gauge artifact. legitimate term propagator nd. 1... mass term lagrangian introduces another term left hand side equation propagator (b1): m2g1...p; p. second part propagator cancels term 2 covariant derivatives acting propagator. multiplied m2 also takes place d (b1). 11...p; 1... thus, change equation gp another mass term. equation (16) become: u(2 + u)g p + (d + 1)(1 + u)g p + gp = 0.
