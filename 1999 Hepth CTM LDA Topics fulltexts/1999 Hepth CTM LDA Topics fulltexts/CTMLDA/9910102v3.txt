abstract

we exhibit a relationship between the massless a(2)
integrable quantum eld theory
2
and a certain third-order ordinary dierential equation, thereby extending a recent
result connecting the massless sine-gordon model to the schrodinger equation. this
forms part of a more general correspondence involving a2-related bethe ansatz sys-
tems and third-order dierential equations. a non-linear integral equation for the
generalised spectral problem is derived, and some numerical checks are performed.
duality properties are discussed, and a simple variant of the nonlinear equation
is suggested as a candidate to describe the nite volume ground state energies of
minimal conformal eld theories perturbed by the operators 12, 21 and 15. this
is checked against previous results obtained using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz.

1 introduction

a curious connection between certain integrable quantum eld theories and the theory
of the schrodinger equation has been the subject of some recent work [14]. in this paper
we extend these results by establishing a link between functional relations for a2-related
bethe ansatz systems (see for example [5,6]) and third-order dierential equations. most
of our analysis concerns a certain specialisation of the model, a particularly symmetric
case that can also be related to the dilute a-model of [7].

in the cases studied in [14], the most general dierential equation was a radial
schrodinger problem with angular momentum l and homogeneous potential x2m , ini-
tially dened on the positive real axis x  (0,) :

(1.1)

(cid:18)

d2
dx2 + x2m +

l(l + 1)

x2 (cid:19) (x, e) = e(x, e) .

the relevant integrable quantum eld theories were the massless twisted sine-gordon
models or, equivalently, the twisted xxz/6-vertex models in their thermodynamic lim-
its, and their reductions. it is worth noting that these models are all related to the lie
algebra a1. spectral functions associated with (1.1) satisfy functional relations [8, 9],
and these were mapped into functional equations appearing in the context of integrable
quantum eld theory in [14]. we will follow a similar strategy here, taking a simple
third-order ordinary dierential equation as our starting-point and showing that the
stokes multipliers and certain spectral functions for this equation together satisfy rela-
tions which are essentially the analogues, for the bethe ansatz systems treated in [6, 7],
of the t-q systems which arise in the context of the integrable quantum eld theories
related to a1 [10, 11]. this is the subject of 2, while in 3 we borrow some other ideas
from integrable quantum eld theory in order to derive a nonlinear integral equation
for the spectral functions, an equation which is put to the test in a simple example
in 4. duality properties are discussed in 5, allowing us to nd the equivalent of the
angular-momentum term in (1.1) for the third-order equation. connections with various
perturbed conformal eld theories are discussed and tested in 6. finally 7 discusses
the most general a2-related ba equations that arise in this context, and 8 contains
our conclusions.

2 the dierential equation

we begin with the following third-order ordinary dierential equation:

y(x, e) + p (x, e)y(x, e) = 0 ,

(2.1)

and initially restrict ourselves to purely homogeneous potentials x3m , giving p (x, e)
the form

p (x, e) = x3m  e .

(2.2)

1

these are the simplest higher-order generalisations of the l = 0 cases of (1.1), and so
we expect that some of the properties of that equation, used in the analysis of [4], will
be preserved. in particular, motivated by the results of [8] for second-order equations,
we suppose that (2.1) has a solution y = y(x, e) such that:
(i) y is an entire function of (x, e) though, due to the branch point in the potential
at x = 0, x must in general be considered to live on a suitable cover of the punctured
complex plane;
(ii) y , y = dy/dx and y = d2y/dx2 admit, for m > 1/2, the asymptotic representations

y  xm e

1

m +1 xm +1

, y  e

1

m +1 xm +1

, y  xm e

1

m +1 xm +1

,

as x tends to innity in the sector

| arg x| <

4

3m + 3

.

(2.3)

(2.4)

furthermore, these asymptotics, or even just the asymptotic of y(x, e) with x remaining
on the positive real axis, characterise y uniquely.

for m  1/2, the story is complicated by the appearance of extra terms in the
asymptotic (2.3). the behaviour of the solution which decays as x  + can be more
generally found from the formula

y(x, e)  p (x, e)1/3 exp(z x

x0

p (t, e)1/3dt) ,

(2.5)

with the constant x0 being related to the normalisation of the solution. (this is the
analogue of an approximate wkb solution of a schrodinger equation.) since to take
m  1/2 would bring other technical problems into the treatment to be given below,
from now on, unless otherwise stated, we shall restrict ourselves to m > 1/2. this
range is the analogue of the semiclassical domain of [11] (see [1, 2, 4] for a discussion
in the context of dierential equations).

given y(x, e), bases of solutions to the third-order equation can be constructed just

as in the second-order case. for general values of k, dene

with

then yk solves

yk(x, e) = ky(kx, 3m ke) ,

 = exp(cid:18) 2i

3m + 3(cid:19) .

yk (x, e) + e2kip (x, e)yk(x, e) = 0 ,

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

and so when k is an integer it provides a (possibly new) solution to the original prob-
lem (2.1). however, since we will shortly need to consider fractional values, we will
leave k arbitrary for now. it is convenient to dene sectors sk as

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)arg x 

2

2k

3m +3(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) <

sk :



3m +3

.

(2.9)

on the cover of the punctured complex plane on which x is dened, the sector sk
abuts the sectors sk1 and sk+1, and the sector (2.4) is s3/2  s1/2  s1/2  s3/2.
the pattern of dominance and subdominance of solutions is more involved than in
the second-order case, since there are now three dierent behaviours for solutions at
large |x|. in addition to a solution with leading behaviour xm exp(xm +1/(m +1))
as |x|  +, there are also solutions which behave as xm exp(ei/3xm +1/(m +1)).
(this is simply a consequence of the fact that the three third roots of 1 are 1, ei/3
and ei/3.) depending on the sector, either one or two of these solutions tend to zero
at large |x|. we call subdominant the solution which tends to zero fastest in a given
sector; then, up to a scalar multiple, yk is characterised as the unique solution to (2.8)
subdominant inside sk.

the asymptotic (2.3) and the denition (2.6) together imply

yk  (m +1)kxm e
yk  (m +1)kxm e

1

m +1 (m +1)kxm +1

1

m +1 (m +1)kxm +1

,

yk  e

1

m +1 (m +1)kxm +1

,

(2.10)

for |x|   with

x  sk3/2  sk1/2  sk+1/2  sk+3/2 .

(2.11)
comparing yk, yk+1 and yk+2 in the region sk+1/2sk+3/2, where the asymptotics of all
three are given by (2.10), establishes their linear independence. the set {yk, yk+1, yk+2}
therefore forms a basis of solutions to (2.8) (and, for k integer, to (2.1) ). alternatively,
we can examine

where the generalised wronskian w [f, g, h] is dened to be

wk1,k2,k3 = w [yk1, yk2, yk3] ,

it is a standard result (see, for example, [12] ) that, for f , g and h solving (2.1), w [f, g, h]
is independent of x, and that f , g and h are linearly independent if and only if w [f, g, h]
is nonzero. for (k1, k2, k3) = (1, 0, 1), the asymptotic (2.10), used in s1/2s1/2, shows
that
(2.14)

w1,0,1 = 8i sin( m

3m +3 ) sin( 2m

3m +3 ) .

it is also the case that

wk1+a,k2+a,k3+a(e) = wk1,k2,k3(3m ae) ,

(2.15)

so wk,k+1,k+2 is nonzero for all k, thus conrming the independence of {yk, yk+1, yk+2}.
we now aim to generalise the analysis of [4] to this situation, guided in part by the
treatment of a2-related ba systems provided by [6]. since y1, y2, y3 form a basis, we
can write

y0  s(1)(e)y1 + s(2)(e)y2  y3 = 0

(2.16)

s(1)(e) =

w0,2,3
w1,2,3

, s(2)(e) =

w1,0,3
w1,2,3

.

(2.17)

the coecient of y3 in (2.16) is 1 by (2.15); s(1) and s(2) are stokes multipliers for
(2.1), and are analytic functions of e. notice the formal similarity between this equation
and eq. (15) of [6].

now suppose that k1 and k2 dier by an integer. then yk1 and yk2 both solve (2.8)
(with e2ki = e2k1i = e2k2i ), and it can be checked by direct substitution that the
function

solves

zk1k2(x, e) = yk1yk2  yk1yk2

zk1k2(x, e)  e2kip (x, e)zk1k2(x, e) = 0 .

(2.18)

(2.19)

this is just the equation adjoint to (2.8); the observation that the wronskian of two
solutions of a third-order ordinary dierential equation satises the adjoint equation
dates back at least to birkho [13] . observe also that if k1 and k2 are shifted by a
half-integer, then a solution of the original equation (2.8) results:

(x, e) + e2kip (x, e)z

(x, e) = 0 .

(2.20)

for |k1  k2| < 3, the regions (2.11) for k = k1 and k = k2 have a nonempty overlap,
and an asymptotic for zk1k2 is easily obtained from (2.10). in particular, for k = 1, 2, 3
we have

zk/2,k/2(x, e)  2i sin(k/3) xm e2 cos(k/3)

1

m +1 xm +1

,

x  + .

(2.21)

for k = 1, z1/2,1/2 solves (2.1), and now from (2.21) we see that it shares (up to a
proportionality factor) the asymptotic (2.3). by uniqueness, we deduce

z1/2,1/2(x, e) = i3 y(x, e) .

(2.22)

unfortunately, this argument is not so eective for the other cases. at k = 2, the formula
(2.21) shows only that z1,1 is not subdominant on the real axis, and this information
is not enough to pin the function down. for k = 3, sin(k/3) = 0 and all that can be
deduced is that the leading asymptotic of z3/2,3/2 is subleading to the term over which
we have control.
the next step is to manipulate (2.16) in order to eliminate either s(1) or s(2). we

have

and, subtracting,

y1y0  s(1)(e)y1y1 + s(2)(e)y1y2  y1y3 = 0 ;
y1y0  s(1)(e)y1y1 + s(2)(e)y1y2  y1y3 = 0 ,

s(2)(e)z12 = z01 + z13 .

4

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

for the reasons just explained, functions zk1k2 with |k1  k2| = 1 are the most easily
handled, so we use the identity y2z13 = y1z23 + z12y3 to rewrite (2.25) as

s(2)(e)y2z12 = y2z01 + z12y3 + z23y1 .

(2.26)

likewise,

(2.27)
now the result (2.22) can be combined with shifts in e to 15m/4e and 21m/4e
respectively to rewrite both (2.26) and (2.27) as

s(1)(e)y1z12 = z12y0 + y1z23 + z01y2 .

t (e)y1/4y1/4 = y1/4y5/4 + y3/4y3/4 + y5/4y1/4 ,

(2.28)

where

(2.29)
as a byproduct, this has established that the two stokes multipliers s(1) and s(2) are
related by an analytic continuation in e.

t (e) = s(1)(15m/4e) = s(2)(21m/4e) .

finally, taking (2.28) at x = 0 yields a functional relation involving e alone. to

absorb various phases, it is convenient to set

q+(e) = e 1

3m y(0, e) , q+

k (e) = q+(3m ke) .

then the relation is

t q+

1/4q+

1/4 = q+

1/4q+

5/4 + q+

3/4q+

3/4 + q+

5/4q+

1/4 .

(2.30)

(2.31)

this is very similar to the equations related to the dilute a model studied in [7,14]. an
equation involving y(0, e) can also be derived. first, dierentiate (2.25) twice with
respect to x:

(2.32)
using the fact that y1, y2 and y3 all solve (2.1), we have y2 z13 = y1 z23 + z12y3 , and so
the previous steps can be repeated to nd

s(2)(e)z12 = z01 + z13 .

t (e)y

1/4y1/4 = y

1/4y5/4 + y

3/4y3/4 + y

5/4y1/4 .

again set x = 0, and dene

q(e) = 1

2 e

1

3m y(0, e) , qk (e) = q(3m ke)

(the factor 1

2 is included for later convenience). then

t q

1/4q1/4 = q

1/4q5/4 + q

3/4q3/4 + q

5/4q1/4 .

(2.33)

(2.34)

(2.35)

there is no simple relation involving y(0, e) alone, but from (2.18) and (2.22) one can
deduce

which allows y(0, e) to be recovered once y(0, e) and y(0, e) are known.

i3y = y1/2y1/2  y

1/2y1/2 ,

(2.36)

3 the non-linear integral equation

the functions q(e) are not single-valued, and to derive an integral equation it is more
convenient to work with the functions y(0, e) and y(0, e) directly. set

d+(e) = y(0, e) , d(e) = 1

2 y(0, e)

(3.1)

3m q(e) and qk (e) = ke 1

(so that d(e) = e 1
3m d(3m ke) ). these are
entire functions of e and can be interpreted as spectral determinants for the third-
order equation (2.1), since their zeroes coincide with the values of e for which the
solution y, decaying at x  + for all values of e, in addition either vanishes at x = 0
(for the zeroes of d+), or has a vanishing second derivative at x = 0 (for the zeroes
of d). (see, for example, ref. [4] for a more detailed discussion of this point in the
context of second-order equations.) for m > 1/2, the functions d(e) have large-|e|
asymptotics
(3.2)

|e|   , |arg(e)| <

(3.3)

the growth of ln d(e) is no larger on the positive real e-axis than elsewhere, so the
orders of d+ and d as functions of e are both equal to , and are less than 1 for
m > 1/2. invoking the hadamard factorisation theorem, we can write

d(e) = d(0)

yk=1(cid:18)1 

e

ek (cid:19) .

(3.4)

the precise values of the constants d(0) are irrelevant for the treatment below, but
some knowledge of the positions of the zeroes {ek } will be crucial. we conjecture that,
for all m > 0, all of the zeroes of d(e) lie on the positive real e-axis. some numerical
evidence in favour of this claim will be presented below.

the generalised t-q relations (2.31), (2.35) taken at either e  {3m/4en } or

e  {3m/4en } imply

d(3m en )
d(3m/2en )

= 1 d(3m en )
d(3m/2en )

,

an equation that can be written in a bethe-ansatz form as

yk=1

ek  3m en
ek  3m en

= 1 yk=1

ek  3m/2en
ek  3m/2en

.

(3.5)

(3.6)

this equation is at least not inconsistent with the conjectured reality of the ens, since
both sides then reduce to pure phases. there are certainly other, complex, solutions to

6

(3.6), so the reality property should be seen as a way of selecting the particular solution
relevant to our dierential equation, analogous to the selection of the ground state in
an integrable model.

a non-linear integral equation, similar to those described in [11, 15, 16], can now be

obtained for the quantity

d(e) = 1 d(3m e)
d(3m e)

d(3m/2e)
d(3m/2e)

.

(3.7)

we shall follow a path that completely parallels the treatment given in [11]. by (3.5),
d(e) = 1 at the points {ek }. (the value 1 might also occur at other points; we
supplement our previous conjecture with the assumption that none of these points lie
on the positive real axis.) the product representation (3.4) implies

ln d(e) = i

returning to + below the real axis. (it is at this point that the conjectures about the
locations of the ens and of the other zeroes of d(e) + 1 are used.) if the new variable
 =  ln e is introduced, the function f becomes

and the constant b0 = 2 sin( m +1
3m )a0 has been xed using the asymptotic behaviour (3.2).
(the corresponding zero mode can be traced to the zero in 1 r at k = i .) the param-
eter  in (3.18) is analogous to the chemical potential (or twist) term in the equations
of [11, 15, 16].

a rst consistency check is immediate:

in the large  limit of (3.18) the driving
term b0e dominates, and so in this limit the functions exp(f()) are 1 at the points

the same limit can be treated directly using a wkb-like approach to the dierential

8

p (x0, e) = 0 (x0 = e1/3m ). now, using analytic continuation (see for example 47
in [17]), the dominant part in the region x < x0 is

was used. the prediction (3.22) agrees perfectly with (3.20). in gure 1 the positions of
the lowest zeroes of d+(e) are plotted in the range 0.1 < 3m < 7, and compared with
the wkb-like prediction. evidence for the reality of the en at 3m = 1 will be given in
the next section; in the meantime, we note that the levels continue smoothly away from
that point, and the eigenvalues appear to remain real in the range studied. (the gure
can be compared with gures 1 and 2 of [4], which illustrate cases where the spectrum
does not remain real in the full range displayed.) the kernel () given in (3.19)
coincides with i/2 times the logarithmic derivative of the scalar factor in the izergin-
korepin s-matrix for the a(2)
2 model [18] (cf. eq. (3.21) of [19], though note that the
normalisation of  used by smirnov in [19] diers from ours: [smirnov] = 2
3 [this paper] .)
this is an element of the advertised link between the dierential equation (2.1) and
the a(2)
2 model, the parameters being related as m = 1/ (with  related to the a(2)
coupling  as  = /(2) [19] ). when 3m is an integer the potential is analytic, and
the associated scattering theory is diagonal; the same phenomenon was observed in the
schrodinger/sine-gordon case in [1]. the similarity between the relations (2.31), (2.35)
and (3.6) and those arising in the dilute a model [7, 14] has already been mentioned.
since the a(2)
2 model is conjectured to be the continuum limit of the dilute a model (see
for example [20]), the fact that elements of it emerge here is not a complete surprise.
nevertheless, it is an encouraging signal that we are on the right track. we will return
to this point in 6.

4 the linear potential

a simple but non-trivial example occurs when m = 1/3, and is the analogue of the airy
case of the second-order problem, discussed in [1, 21]. this lies outside the m > 1/2
zone treated so far, so we have to assume that the results obtained above continue to
hold as the region of their initial derivation is left. the basic dierential equation is

y(x, e) + xy(x, e) = ey(x, e) .

where the integration path  is represented in gure 2. (a curious feature of this case
is that the function t (e) is a constant, equal to 1.) even though the problem is not
self-adjoint, numerical evidence suggests that all the zeroes of a(x), a(x) and a(x)
lie on the negative real axis (see gure 3), and so the zeroes of y(0, e)  a(e), and
of y(0, e) and y(0, e), are positive and real. in the rst columns of tables 1 and 2,
the positions of the rst ten zeroes of a(x) and a(x) are displayed.
the approximate positions of the zeroes of a(x) can be found from the wkb formula
of the last section. as a check, we rederive them here via a saddle-point treatment of

at m = 0 (4.11) reduces to the m = 1/3 wkb prediction (3.22). in tables 1 and 2
the results from formula (4.11) are compared with the exact result from a numerical
treatment of (4.3), and also against the results of the numerical solution of the nonlinear
integral equation (3.18). clearly the agreement is very good.

5 duality and a more general chemical potential

in this section we shall investigate the eect of a duality transformation on (2.1), anal-
ogous to that studied in [2] for the schrodinger equation (1.1).
in the schrodinger
case duality maps wavefunctions for conning potentials (m > 0) to wavefunctions
for singular potentials (1 < m < 0), in such a way that the theories with m and
m = m/(m + 1) are dual, their respective spectral problems being essentially equiva-
lent. it also changes the coecient of the angular momentum term l(l+1)/x2 in (1.1)
in a non-trivial way; the same phenomenon here will allow us to guess the corresponding
term for the third-order problem (2.1).

to implement the duality transformation, we begin with a langer [22] -type variable

transformation

after which (2.1) becomes

y(x) = ezu(z) , z = ln x ,

(5.1)

u(z)  u(z) + (e(3m +3)z  ee3z)u(z) = 0 .

(5.2)
the duality m  m is now eected by interchanging the roles of the two exponentials.
substituting z  z

m +1 + ln m +1

e1/3 yields

u(z) 

1

(m + 1)2 u(z) + (e3z/(m +1)  ee3z)u(z) = 0 ,

where e = (m +1)3m /em +1.

now transforming back results in the equation

y +

m (m +2)
(m +1)2 (

1
x2

d
dx 

1

x3 )y + (x

3m

m +1  e)y = 0 .

(5.3)

(5.4)

as promised, the conning potential x3m has been exchanged for a singular potential
x3m/(m +1), and a new term, proportional to (x2d/dx  x3)y, has been generated.
this motivates us to enlarge the set of dierential equations under consideration to

y  g(

1
x2

d
dx 

1
x3 )y + (x3m  e)y = 0

(5.5)

13

with g a new parameter, analogous to l(l+1) for the schrodinger equation. duality
maps (5.5) to

y  g(

x3 )y + (x3 m  e)y = 0 ,

(5.6)

(5.7)

(5.8)

duality therefore maps the 3-parameter family ({m, e, g}) of dierential equations (5.5)
onto itself. the analysis of 2 can now be repeated for these generalised problems. it
is convenient to write g = g(g+2) and to work mostly with g instead of g. we rst
enlarge the scope of (2.6) by setting

yk(x, e, g) = ky(kx, 3m ke, g) ;

then yk solves

1
x2

d
dx 

yk  g(

1
x3 )yk + e2kip (x, e)yk = 0 .
next we dene zk1k2 as in (2.18). if e2k1i = e2k2i  e2ki, then
1
x3 )zk1k2  e2kip (x, e)zk1k2 = 0 ,

zk1k2  g(

d

(5.9)

(5.10)

(5.11)

which is the equation adjoint to (5.10). we can recover the original problem by shifting
k by a half-integer, and arguing just as before we nd that

z1/2,1/2(x, e, g) = i3 y(x, e, g)

and then

t (e, g)y1/4 y1/4 = y1/4 y5/4 + y3/4 y3/4 + y5/4 y1/4 ,

(5.12)

(5.13)

where t (e, g) = s(1)(15m/4e, g) = s(2)(21m/4e, g) , and s(1) and s(2) are dened as
in (2.16). a non-zero value of g = g(g+2) causes (5.10) to be singular at the origin, so
simply considering (5.13) at x = 0 is not an option. instead, we expand y(x, e, g) as

y(x, e, g) = d+(e, g) + + d0(e, g) 0 + d(e, g)  ,

(5.14)

where {+, 0, } forms a basis of solutions dened via behaviour near the origin:

i(x, e, g)  xi + o(xi+3) ,

i = +, 0, ,

(5.15)

notice that the operator x2d/dx  x3 is by itself anti-self-adjoint; this gives some insight as to

why it is a sensible generalisation of the x2 term in the schrodinger equation.

with the is the roots of the indicial equation (  1)((  2)  g(g + 2)) = 0 :

explicitly, the functions d+, d0 and d are

d+ =

w [y, 0, ]
w [+, 0, ]

, d0 =

w [y, , +]
w [+, 0, ]

, d =

w [y, +, 0]
w [+, 0, ]

,

(5.17)

with w [+, 0, ] = 2 (g+1)3. at g = 0 they reduce to y(0, e), y(0, e) and y(0, e)/2
respectively, in agreement with the notation of earlier sections.

dening

q(e, g) = e

g+1

3m d(e, g) , qk = q(3m ke, g) ,

(5.18)

the generalised t-q relations (2.31), (2.35) have exactly the same form as before, and
(3.6) becomes

yk=1

ek  3m en
ek  3m en

= (g+1) yk=1

ek  3m/2en
ek  3m/2en

.

(5.19)

the arguments of 3 can now be repeated essentially verbatim, to discover that, so long
as g is such that the conjectures of 3 about the zeroes of t and d remain true,
the quantities d+ and d for the more general dierential equation (5.5) are again
described by the nonlinear integral equation (3.18), but with chemical potential term
now taking the value  = 2

at m = 1, 3m = 1, the lhs of (5.19) is 1 and the a2-related ba equation
collapses onto one more closely linked with a1. this leads to a rather surprising
equivalence between spectral problems for a schrodinger equation with potential x6 +
l(l + 1)/x2 and the third-order problem (5.5) at m = 1. for these special points, the
quantities in this paper are related to those of [4] as

6 a link with perturbed conformal eld theory

we now return to the relation with the a(2)
2 model, briey mentioned at the end of 3.
the analogy with results of [15,16] for the a1-related models suggests that the quantity

ce =

6ib0

2 (cid:18)zc1

e ln(1+ef ()) d zc2

e ln(1+ef ()) d(cid:19)

(6.1)

15

should be interpreted as an eective central charge of an underlying conformal eld
theory. for general  = 2

3 (g+1) , this would predict

ce = 1 

3

m + 1

2 .

(6.2)

going further, it is natural to interpret (3.18) and (6.1) as the ultraviolet limit of the
following massive system:

f () = i  ir sinh  +zc1

() ln(1+ef ()) d zc2

ce (r) =

3ir

2 (cid:18)zc1

sinh  ln(1+ef ()) d zc2

() ln(1+ef ()) d ;

sinh  ln(1+ef ()) d(cid:19) .

(6.3)

this should encode nite-size eects in the massive a(2)
theory, with r = msr, ms the
2
mass of the fundamental soliton and r the circumference of the (innite) cylinder on
which the theory is living. (notice that there is no need to distinguish f + from f any
more, since the mapping    now has the eect of negating .) there is now a
natural scale, which can be related to an operator  perturbing the ultraviolet conformal
eld theory. standard considerations [23], based on the    + i2 m +1
3m periodicity of
f (), suggest that so long as  is not an integer ce (r) will have an expansion in powers
of r6m/(m +1) (together with an irregular anti-bulk term, irrelevant to the current
discussion). this implies for  either the conformal dimensions

h = h = 1 

3m

2m +2

(6.4)

and an expansion of ce (r) in which only even powers of the coupling  to the operator
 appear, or, alternatively, the conformal dimensions

h = h = 1 

3m
m +1

(6.5)

and an expansion which sees both even and odd powers of .

when  is an integer, the standard considerations of [23] may have to be modied.
absorbing the term i into a shift in f (), (6.3) becomes exactly odd under a negation
of . this forces the shifted f () to be zero at  = 0, even in the far ultraviolet, and
so long as the would-be plateau value is nonzero, it splits the plateau region into two
pieces, each of half the previous length. as a result, the regular expansion of ce (r) is
in powers of r3m/(m +1), and not r6m/(m +1). formula (6.4) now describes the situation
when both even and odd powers of  appear in the expansion of ce , while for even
powers only, the correct formula is h = h = 1  3m/(4m +4). note though that this
plateau-splitting eect does not occur at  = 0, since for this case the plateau value of
f is anyway zero, and imposing f (0) = 0 has no eect.

as explained in [19] (see also [2527]), the a(2)

2 model, when appropriately quantum-
reduced, should correspond to the minimal models mp,q (with p and q coprime integers

16

and p < q) perturbed by either 12, 21 or [28,29] 15. with 12 the perturbing operator,
the relation with the parameter  appearing in the kernel (3.19) is [19]

p
q

=

(1+)

.

(6.6)

since m = 1/, the ultraviolet eective central charge for a given value of , as predicted
by (6.2), is

ce = 1 

3p
2q

2 .

(6.7)

to recover 21 perturbations one simply has to swap p and q in (6.6) and (6.7) [19],
while to nd 15, p/q should be replaced by 4p/q [28].

for the sine-gordon model, naturally associated with the 13 perturbing opera-
tor [30, 31], it has been observed both analytically and numerically [11, 15, 16, 32, 33]
that reduction is implemented at the level of nite-size eects and the non-linear inte-
gral equation via a particular choice of the chemical potential. the similarity between
our equations and those in [15,16] suggests that the same should be true here. to decide
which value of  will tune (6.3) onto the ground state of the relevant perturbed minimal
model, we demand that the ultraviolet eective central charges match up; the predicted
dimensions of the perturbing operators, and a comparison of results at nonzero values
of r with those obtained via the thermodynamic bethe ansatz method, will then provide
some nontrivial tests of the proposal.

4q  1

3 ) and (1, 0) against the tables of [24, 34] for the a(2)

the eective central charge of the ground state of the theory mpq is ce = 1 6/pq.
thus to have any chance of matching the vacua of the 12-perturbed models, we must
set  = 2/p. the required value of h, namely h12 = 3p
2 , is then matched by (6.4).
the value just chosen for  being a non-zero integer if and only if p = 2, (6.4) will
be the correct formula to use provided the regular parts of the ground state energies
of the models mpq perturbed by 12 expand in even powers of  for p  3, and in
even and odd powers for p = 2. this prediction holds for all of the examples that
2 , 1
we checked. we then compared numerical results for (m, ) = (4, 1), ( 5
2 ),
( 4
3 , 1
(yang-lee), e8, e7, e6 and
d4-related tba equations, respectively, nding excellent agreement. swapping p and
q in (6.7), the choice  = 2/q should capture the 21 cases. the conformal weight of
h21 = 3q
2 is matched by (6.4), provided the swap of p and q in (6.6) is remembered.
this time  is never an integer, and the use of (6.4) is justied by the regular parts
of the ground state energies of the 21 perturbations always being in even powers of
the coupling . for (m, ) = ( 1
5 ) the results from the a1 and
a2-related tba equations [24] and the m35 model [35, 36] were reproduced within our
numerical accuracy. finally, replacing p/q by 4p/q in (6.2) (q > 2p), at  = 1/p the
models mpq perturbed by 15 are recovered. this time it is (6.5) which predicts the
correct value for h, as expected given that 15 perturbations expand in both even

and odd powers of . tba equations for a number of 15-perturbed models have been
proposed in [28, 35, 37], but so far we have only compared (3.18) with the tba for the
15 perturbation of the m37 model given in [35]. a selection of our numerical results
for all of the cases just mentioned is presented in table 3, together with thermodynamic
bethe ansatz data taken from refs. [24, 3436]. to facilitate the comparision, we took
r = m1r throughout, with m1 the mass of the fundamental particle in the reduced
scattering theory. for a(2)
and e8 this is the rst breather in the unreduced theory,
2
and m1 is equal to 2 cos(5/12)ms and 2 cos(3/10)ms respectively. in all of the other
models in the table, m1 is equal to ms. the results strongly support the claim that
the system (6.3) encodes the ground state energies of 12, 21 and 15 perturbations of
minimal models.

in previously-studied examples, equations similar in form to those for the ground
state have been found to describe excited states (see for example [11, 32, 38, 39]). we
expect that the same will be possible here, but we will leave investigation of this point for
future work. finally, we remark that it would be interesting to derive a nonlinear integral
equation for the a(2)
2 model directly from nite lattice ba equations. we understand
that progress is currently being made in this direction [40].

7 general a2-related ba equations

in this section, we discuss the eect of adding a term proportional to x3 to the dier-
ential equation (5.5). the equation becomes

y  g(

1
x2

d
dx 

1
x3 )y + p (x, e, l)y = 0 ,

where

l
x3 .
duality acts on m and g as before, and transforms l as

p (x, e, l) = x3m  e +

l  l =

l

(m + 1)3 .

(7.1)

(7.2)

(7.3)

the relation (5.7), apart from the appearance of l and l as arguments of y and y
respectively, is unchanged. the earlier treatment can be generalised by dening

yk  yk(x, e, g, l) = ky(kx, 3m ke, g, 3(m +1)kl) ,

so that

yk  g(

1
x2

d
dx 

1
x3 )yk + e2kip (x, e, l)yk = 0 .

if we also dene zk1k2 as in (2.18), then, for k1 and k2 diering by an integer,

zk1k2  g(

1
x2

d
dx 

1
x3 )zk1k2  e2kip (x, e, l)zk1k2 = 0 ,

(7.4)

(7.5)

(7.6)

(with e2k1i = e2k2i  e2ki ) which is the adjoint to (7.5). again we can re-
cover the original problem by shifting k by a half-integer. as before, we nd that
z1/2,1/2(x, e, g, l) = i3 y(x, e, g, l) and (cf. (2.28))

t (e, g, l)y1/4y1/4 = y1/4y5/4 + y3/4y3/4 + y5/4y1/4 .

(7.7)

the presence of a non-vanishing l has however introduced an extra complication. to
see this explicitly, shift k by 1/4 to get

t y0y1/2 = y0y3/2 + y1y1/2 + y1y1/2 ,

(7.8)

with t  = t (e
y(x, e, g, l), both signs of l appear: for k integer or half-integer we have

4 , g,il). if this equation is rewritten in terms of the function

3m

yk = ky(xk, e3m k, g, (1)2k l) .

(7.9)

notice that the same does not happen for the argument g (or g), which is why this prob-
lem did not arise before. from an analytic point of view, y(x, e, g, l) and y(x, e, g,l)

19

are just two distinct points of the same function, but in the derivation of the nonlinear
integral equation it is only the analyticity in e that is used. to proceed, it is best
to consider l to be held xed once and for all, and to treat the pair of functions
vk = ky(kx, 3m ke, g, l) and vk = ky(kx, 3m ke, g,l) independently.
then (7.8) becomes

t v0v1/2 = v0v3/2 + v1v1/2 + v1v1/2 .

(7.10)

this equation is very reminiscent of those given in [6] for the a2-lattice model. there
remains an x-dependence in (7.10) which can be eliminated, once again, by expanding

v = d+(e, g, l) + + d0(e, g, l) 0 + d(e, g, l)  ,
v = d+(e, g, l) + + d0(e, g, l) 0 + d(e, g, l)  ,

(7.12)
where {+, 0, } and { +, 0, } are alternative bases dened via the behaviour
near the origin

(7.11)

i(x, e, g, l)  xi + o(xi+3) ,
i+3) ,
i(x, e, g, l)  x

i + o(x

i = +, 0, ,
i = +, 0, ,

(7.13)

(7.14)

and the is and i are respectively solutions of the indicial equations

(  1)((  2)  g(g + 2))  l = 0 . (7.15)
(  1)((  2)  g(g + 2)) + l = 0 ,
if the labeling is chosen consistently with that of section 5, so that the s and the s
reduce to the quantities in (5.16) when l = 0, then

with

t q0

q
1/2 = q0

q
3/2 + q1

q
1/2 + q

q1/2 ,

q(e, g, l) = e

q(e, g, l) = e

1
3m d(e, g, l) , qk = q(3m ke, g, l) ,
1
3m d(e, g, l) , qk = q(3m ke, g, l) .

this leads to two coupled sets of ba equations

yk=1

generalising the analysis of 3, it should be possible to derive a nonlinear integral
equation relevant to this more general case. we expect that this equation will coincide
with the a(1)
2 -related case of the equations found in [41,42], in its massless limit, but we
will leave a detailed investigation for future work.

8 conclusions

we have continued to study the relationship between integrable quantum eld theories
and ordinary dierential equations, and in the process have obtained a novel nonlinear
integral equation which is able to describe the 12, 21 and 15 perturbations of minimal
models within a unied framework. we have also found a natural generalisation of
the duality symmetry enjoyed by the schrodinger/massless sine gordon system [2]. a
major theme has been that the a2 structures hidden inside certain third-order ordinary
dierential equations, and also inside certain integrable quantum eld theories and ba
systems, are very closely related. it seems clear that the correct way to generalise to yet
further models is to look to dierential equations of even higher order. while this might
appear to be a task of ever-increasing complexity, there are some reasons to suppose
that a more unied picture will ultimately emerge. ade structures have been observed
in many dierent, but related, settings in the context of integrable models (see, for
example, [5, 23, 4145] and references therein). one might hope that the process of
generalisation will reveal similar phenomena on the dierential equations side of the
correspondence, but more case-by-case analysis will certainly be required before this
can be conrmed.

notes added 
(i) the massless nonlinear integral equation derived in 3 has appeared previously, in
connection with the izergin-korepin model, in [46].
(ii) a conjecture due to kausch et al [37, 47] states that the 12 perturbation of mp,q
and the 15 perturbation of mp,q have identical ground-state scaling functions if (and
only if) p = p/2, q = 2q. (this implies p = 2 mod 4, since (p, q) and (p, q) must both
be coprime; such pairs are called type ii in [37].) it is easily checked that this equality
follows from the recipe for nding ground-state scaling functions given in 6 above: the
values of m and  that should be used in the two cases are identical, and so both are
described by the same nonlinear integral equation. we take this as additional support
both for our conjectures and for that of [37].
(iii) in a recent paper [48], suzuki has independently remarked the relevance of higher-
order ordinary dierential equations to integrable models associated with the algebra
an, though with a slightly dierent emphasis from that adopted above.

we would like to thank ole warnaar and the referee for bringing ref. [46] to our atten-
tion, and gabor takacs for telling us about the type ii conjecture.
