abstract

it is shown that dynamics of d + 2 elements of the (super)dieomorphism group in
one (1+1 for the super) dimension describes the d - dimensional (spinning) massless
relativistic particles. the coordinates of this elements (d + 2 einbeins, d + 2 con-
nections and 1 additional common coordinate of higher dimensionality) play the role
of coordinates, momenta and lagrange multiplier, needed for the manifestly confor-
mal and reparametrization invariant description of the d - dimensional (spinning)
particle in terms of the d + 2 - dimensional spacetime.

1 introduction

as is well known there exist several equivalent formulations of the massless relativis-
tic particles. the second order and rst order formalisms are examples of them. the
essential ingredient of both approaches is einbein - the eld describing one dimen-
sional gravity. one more example is the conformally invariant description [1], which
starts from d + 2 dimensional spacetime. the existence of alternative approaches
always sheds some new light on the nature of the physical system. in particular,
the conformally invariant description from the very beginning considers the particle
coordinates and einbein on the equal footings. for the extended spinning particle
[2]-[7] the analogous description [8] shows that the gravitinos of the corresponding
one dimensional supergravity are on the same footings as well.

in the present work we consider the natural description of the massless relativistic
particle and n = 1 spinning particle in terms of nonlinear realization of the innite
dimensional dieomorphism group of the one dimensional space ((1,1) superspace).
we construct the rst order conformally invariant formulation and show that
the spacetime coordinates and one dimensional supergravity elds are realized as
dilatons of one dimensional dieomorphism group. we consider simultaneously the
dynamics of d + 2 dierent points in the group space, hence they contain the same
number of dilatons. the corresponding (d + 2) components of momentum are
connected with the cristoel symbols. one more parameter of the group having
higher dimension is the same for all (d + 2) points. it plays the role of lagrange
multiplier and eectively reduces the number of spacetime coordinates from d + 2
to d ones.

in the second section of the paper we describe the conformally invariant approach
to relativistic particles and spinning particles. the third section is devoted to the
description of spinless particle.
in the fourth and fth sections we construct the
reparametrization invariant in the (1, 1) superspace worldvolume action for n = 1
spinning particle. some further possibilities of applying the developed formalism
are discussed in conclusions.

2 conformally invariant description

in this section for convenience of reader we remind the conformally invariant de-
scription of the relativistic particle [1], n = 1 [1],[8] and extended [8] spinning
particle.

the action for bosonic massless relativistic particle in d - dimensional spacetime
can be written in terms of d +2 coordinates xa, a = 0, 1, . . . d +1, of the spacetime
with the signature
(2.1)

) :

a = ( + + . . . + +

}
s = z d (
x2).

(2.3)

(2.4)

the relation of the action (2.2) with the usual d - dimensional action is established
by solving the equation of motion for the lagrange multiplier 

xaxa  xaxa + 2x+x = 0; a = 0, . . . , d  1; x =

(xd  xd+1).

in terms of new variables

x =

e =

(x =

the lagrangian becomes

its reparametrization invariance

x =  x,

e = e +  e

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

is the consequence of (2.3)-(2.4).

the modication of the action (2.2) to the case of extended spinning particle [6]

is [8]

(2.9)

(for n = 1 spinning particle the action was constructed in [1]). here i, i = 1, . . . n,
are grassmann variables which become  - matrices upon quantization. after the
solution of the equations of motion for the lagrange multipliers , i and some
redenitions like (2.6) one can derive the usual d - dimensional action for n -
extended spinning particle in the form of [6].

so, the lagrange multipliers  in pure bosonic case and , i in the case of
extended spinning particle play the crucial role in the conversion of the d + 2
- dimensional actions into d - dimensional ones. nevertheless, their geometrical
meaning as well as the nature of initial d + 2 coordinates xa is unclear. in the next
sections we will show that all this functions of  have an interpretation in terms of
parameters of dieomorphism groups.

3 geometrical description of the massless particle

consider the auxiliary 1 - dimensional bosonic space with the coordinate s. the
generators of the corresponding dieomorphism group

lm = ism+1 
s

,

2

(3.1)

form the virasoro algebra without central charge

[ln, lm] = i(n  m)ln+m.

(3.2)

in what follows we will consider the subalgebra of the algebra (3.2) which is formed
by the regular at the origin generators lm, m  1.

the most natural is the following parametrization of the group element

g = ei l1  eiu 1l1  eiu 2l2  eiu 3l3 . . . eiu l0,

(3.3)

in which all multipliers with the exception of eiu l0 are ordered with the help of
dimensionality of the correspondent generators:
[lm] = m. such structure of the
group element simplies the evaluation of the variations u m under the innitesimal
left action

(3.4)
m=0 mlm1 belongs to the algebra of the dieomorphism group. the

g = (1 + i)g,

where  = p

transformation laws of the coordinates in (3.3) are [9]

 = ( )  0 + 1 + 2 2 + . . . ,
u = ( ),
1
u 1 =  ( )u 1 +
2
u 2 = 2 ( )u 2 +

...
 ( ).

( ),

(3.5)
(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

in general u n transforms through  and u m, m < n. at this stage it is natural
to consider all parameters as the elds in one dimensional space parametrized by
coordinate  .
it means the following active form of the transformations of the
parameters u( ), u m( )

u( ) = ( ) u ( ) + ( ),
1
u 1( ) = ( ) u 1( )  ( )u 1( ) +
2
u 2( ) = ( ) u 2( )  2 ( )u 2( ) +

( ),

...
 ( ).

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

one can easily verify that the functions x = eu ( )/2 and  = 3u 2( ) have
exactly the transformation laws (2.3)-(2.4) with ( ) = . simultaneously u 1( )
transforms as one dimensional cristoel symbol.
the independence of u 2 from u and u 1 means that one can consider more than

one group elements

ga = ei l1  eiu 1

al1  eiu 2l2  eiu 3

al3 . . . eiual0, a = 0, 1 . . . , d + 1,

(3.12)

which have identical values of parameters  and u 2( ) and dier in the values of all
other parameters u m
a . this property is valid when all of them are transformed with

3

the same innitesimal transformation parameter ( ). note that higher parameters
u m, m  3 can not be identical because their transformation laws include u 1
a. on
the other side for each integer n exists such parametrization of the group elements

tions

where a is the signature (2.1), is invariant under the transformation (3.14) and
corresponds to the rst order formalism for the action (2.2).
indeed, after the
integration by parts in the rst term and change of variables

xa = eua( )/2, pa = eua( )/2u 1

it becomes

4 n = 1 spinning particle in a superconformal

gauge

to generalize the approach on the spinning particles we rstly consider more simple
example of the n = 1 superconformal algebra (sca)

[lm, ln] = i(m  n)lm+n
m
[lm, gs] = i(
2  s)gm+s
{gr, gs} = 2lr+s.

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

the indices m, n  1 are integer and r, s  1/2 -halnteger. following the
considerations of preceding chapter and [9] we write the group element as

ga = ei l1  eig1/2  ei3/2g3/2  eiu 2l2   

(4.4)

ei

a g1/2  eiu 1

al1  eiual0, a = 0, 1 . . . , d + 1.

all parameters (grassmann -s and commuting u-s) are considered as superfunc-
tions of  and  which parametrize the (1, 1) superspace. the variation of superspace
coordinates under the left action of innitesimal superconformal transformation can
be written in terms of one bosonic superfunction

to calculate the invariant dierential - forms one should take into account that
grassmann parity of dierential of any variable is opposite to its own grassmann
parity, i.e. d is odd and d is even [10]. the general expression for  -form is

a = g1

gration measure, depend on the index a.

after the introduction of new variables

x = eu/2,  = eu/2u 1,  = eu/21/2,

integration by parts in rst term and omitting the index a the action becomes

s =

all parameters (odd ,  and even u, v ) again are considered as superfunctions of

(5.20)

in this action without loss of any information one can choose the gauge (5.13).
indeed, when we calculate the equation of motion for  and choose this gauge, they
are consequence of the equations of motion, which follow from the gauge xed action.
the parameter m in the action is arbitrary parameter of dimension of mass. on
mass shell it eectively disappears, because the last term (5.20) in the action is
auxiliary. its rst term in a gauge (5.13) is a total derivative and the equation of
motion for ua  2va leads to the connection between 1/2

a and 1/2
a :

1/2
a = i1/2
a .

(5.21)

this last equation reduces the action (5.18) to the action for n = 1 superconformal
group (4.15).

so, the action (5.18), which is invariant under the transformations of the whole
dieomorphism group of the (1, 1) superspace describes the n = 1 spinning particle.

6 conclusions

in the framework of nonlinear realizations of innite - dimensional dieomorphism
groups of one dimensional bosonic space and (1, 1) superspace we have constructed
the conformally and reparametrization invariant actions for massless particle and
n = 1 spinning particle in arbitrary dimension d. it is achieved by simultaneous
consideration of several group elements. the parameters of corresponding group
points include simultaneously the coordinates and momenta. the interaction be-
tween coordinates is obliged to parameters with higher dimensions, which are the
same for all considered points on the group space.

it would be interesting to apply the method developed here and in [9] to other
innite dimensional symmetries, such as dieomorphism groups of extended super-
spaces and higher dimensional spaces, w-algebras and so on
