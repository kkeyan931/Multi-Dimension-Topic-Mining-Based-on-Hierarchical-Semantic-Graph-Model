based on results for real deformation parameter q we introduce a compact non-
commutative structure covariant under the quantum group soq(3) for q being a

1 introduction

in paper [1] it was shown, how the q-deformation of the well-known group so(3) to
quantum group soq(3) can be used to dene a non-commutative quatum space as a
comodule of the quatum group. it is very natural to exploit the r matrix as the main
tool. its decomposition into projectors generates a non-commutative (three-dimensional)
euclidean space of coordinates.

in all papers known to us the non-commutative structure has been dened for real q
only. the value of q becomes important when we demand hermiticity for coordinates
(and later on for momenta). for general complex q the r matrix looses its hermiticity
which requires a new denition of conjugation for the coordinate operators. on the other
hand their are at least two reasons why one should investigate the case of complex q .

1

first, real q implies always a non-compact coordinate space, while for a compact space
we have to admit complex values of q . in context with the fact, that non-commutative
geometry [2] is considered to be the result of some deep dynamical principle which may
be found e.g.
in string theory the case of compactied dimensions is of special interest.
we start here the consideration of an example with only compactied coordinates. the
more interesting case with compact and non-compact dimensions (which seems to require
dierent q) is due to further work. second, we know the quantum group soq(3) for
generic q and especially the case q being a root of unity, where it demonstrates some
pecularities [3,4]. it is therefore interesting how a non-commutative quantum space can
be constructed in that special case. this will be the main aim of our paper.

as we have already mentioned, the key point is the denition of a conjugation for
coordinates and momenta, which are later required to be self-adjoint with respect to that
conjugation. dierent conjugations result in dierent spaces and hence dierent physics.
the conjugation we will propose below is of course equivalent to ordinary conjugation for
real q . we know two ways which are both consistent with soq(3) . the choice that ts
best with our problem is the one, where q is left untouched during conjugation. thus if x
is the conjugate of an operator x , the conjugate of qx is q x . this choice has been used
already before, e.g. in [3]. the other way , one may nd i.e. in [4], seems to work better
in case if one deals with non-hermitean operators having only real eigenvalues, which will
not be the case here.

at the rst moment our denition looks rather unnatural but in chap. 2 we shall
describe how it works and mention the consequences. the most important one of them
is that self-adjoint operators will have (instead of real ones) eigenvalues which are real
functions of the parameter q . but this is just what we need, because the scaling oper-
ator and its commutation properties force coordinates and momenta to have eigenvalues
proportional to powers of q .

the paper is organized as follows.

in chap. 2 we recall the basic formulae for the
quantum space of soq(3) and state the modications for our q . in chap. 3 we consider
a one-dimensional example of a q-deformed heisenberg algebra and demonstrate how it
works for q being a root of unity. it is rather helpful to compare our results with earlier
ones for real q with the same example. in our main chap. 4 the non-commutative space
covariant under soq(3) is considered and matrix elements of coordinates and momenta
are calculated. the results are presented explicitly and do not contain any divergencies
which usually occur if one simply replaces q in formulae derived earlier for real q only.

2

2 euclidean phase space for q being a root of unity

first we have to recall some basic formulae of the non-commutative space from paper [1]
which do not depend on the nature of q . the r matrix of soq(3) is decomposed like

r = p5 

1
q4 p3 +

1
q6 p1

(2.1)

we shall not give the projectors pi here, because we need only p3 . the non-commutative
euclidean space is dened by:

in the common basis (2.2) looks like :

p3xx = 0

x 3x + = q2x +x 3
x 3x  = q2x x 3
x x + = x +x  + x 3x 3

(2.2)

(2.3)

here  = q  1

q . it is natural to dene a metric gab and an invariant product x  y

x  y = gabx ay b

g+ = 1/q,

g33 = 1

g+ = q,

(2.4)

which let x  x commute with x a. p3 can be expressed through a generalized -tensor
(2.5)

ab

1

1 + q4 f abf dc

p3

cd =

where its indices are moved according to formulae like

+

3 = q,
+ = 1,
+3
 = q2,
eq. (2.3) is then equivalent to

3

33

3 = 1  q2,

abc = gcd ab

d

+3 = q,
+ = q2,
3+
 = 1

3

x cx bbc

a = 0

and the r matrix can be expressed in the form

rab

cd = a

c b

d  q4f abf dc  q4(q2  1)gabgcd

now we come to the denition of conjugation. we still choose

x a = gabx b  xa

3

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

like in paper [1] . but for generic complex q this is consistent with eqns. (2.3) only if we
dene q = q which means q is unchanged under conjugation. this forces us to distinguish
between q (and its functions) and constant complex numbers which are to be conjugated
as usual. (we mean e. g. the i in the heisenberg relation, s. b.)

as a consequence of our denition self-adjoint operators like (xx) still have orthogonal
eigenstates for dierent eigenvalues (under the scalar product induced by conjugation),
but their eigenvalues are no longer real. they are rather real functions of the parameter
q . examples will follow below. another consequence is that the scalar product of a vector
by itsself is no longer of denite sign and can even vanish for special values of q . similar
modications occur for unitary operators being discussed below. based on eq (2.10) we
can now proceed as in [1] and dene a derivative, momentum, angular momentum and
the scaling operator  in the same way. for the components of the momentum we have
the analog of (2.8), while for angular momentum

and

lclbbc

a = 1/q2w la

q4(q2  1)2l  l = w 2  1
law = w la

the scaling operator  is introduced in the same way with the properties

1/2x a = q2x a1/2
1/2p a = q2p a1/2
1/2la = la1/2
1/2w = w 1/2

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

conjugation of vector values is analogeous to eq. (2.10), w is self-adjoint and  is unitary
up to normalization:

1/2 = q61/2

(2.14)

eqns. (2.12) lead to the standard soq(3) algebra. the generalized heisenberg relations
are

p ax b  r1ab

cdx cp d = 

i
2

1/2{(1 + q6)gabw  (1  q4)abclc}

(2.15)

now we have to study representations of this algebra. for q being a root of unity the
physical relevant representations become nite dimensional while for real q they have
innite dimension. thus there is no dierence here between self-adjoint, essentially self-
adjoint and hermitean operators.

the representations will be studied in detail in chap. 4 .

3 representations of a one-dimensional q-deformed

heisenberg algebra

we consider now a one-dimensional example of a q-deformed heisenberg algebra. that is
neither a projection of the euclidean space nor based on the deformation of any symmetry
group. it is even not non-commutative in the sense of space coordinates because there
is only one. nevertheless it is based on a modied leibniz rule and has been studied for
real q in great detail [5,6]. it reects very nicely the deep role which is played by the
scaling operator  that one has to introduce in a general non-commutative structure of
coordinates and momenta. the algebra looks as follows :

conjugation is given by

1
q

p x  qxp = iu

up = qp u

ux =

1
q

xu

p = p
x = x
u = u 1

(3.1)

(3.2)

there is no problem for real q , for complex q we demand q = q with the same consequences
as in chap. 2 . then (3.2) is consistent with (3.1) . now we put q a root of unity, q = ei/r,
qr = 1. the integer r is taken larger than 2 . we shall consider a representation of
the algebra (3.1) based on eigenvectors of p . from the second equation it follows that
applying u to such an eigenstate we obtain another one with eigenvalue multiplied by
q1 . therefore we have

p | n >0= 0qn | n >0

where n is integer, 0  n  2r  1 , and it is sucient to have 0 > 0 . further

and we can introduce the scalar product

u | n >0=| n  1 >0

0 < n | m >0= nm

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

now we have an example that the self-adjoint operator p has eigenvalues being real
numbers multiplied by powers of q . those powers are a consequence of the properties of
u . for our q choosen we can see that the eigenstate u | 0 >0 has the same eigenvalue
as | 2r  1 >0 . disregarding the case of degeneration we have

u | 0 >0= c(0) | 2r  1 >0

(3.6)

5

where c is a phase factor and dierent c label dierent representations. from eqns. (3.4)
and (3.6) we have u 2r = c for any state in our representation. now it is straightforward
to dene another unitary operator u  by

u  = ue i

2r

(3.7)

where we have put c = ei then u 2r = 1 and it is more convenient to work with a new
system | n >

u  | n >=| n  1 >

(3.8)

the new eigenstates are just multiplied by phase factors. for shortness we have omitted
the upper index 0 . from the rst equation of (3.1) and its conjugate one can deduce

xp =

i


(qu 

1
q

u 1)

(3.9)

which shows the action of x on the states | n > states:
1
q

2r | n  1 > 

x | n >=

qn0

1

(qe

i

e i

2r | n + 1 >)

(3.10)

this system of 2r equations can be solved and the eigenvalues und eigenstates of x can
be found. but it is easier to exploit the eigenstates of u, as we shall demonstrate below.
we start with

| 0 > =

2r1

x

n=0

| n >

| k > = (0)kp k | 0 >=

2r1

x

n=0

qkn | n >

and integer 0  k  2r  1 . obviously

u  | k >= qk | k >

(3.11)

(3.12)

we mention that for real q those states are non-normalizable which is not the case here.

before constructing the eigenstates of x we shortly comment on the eigenstates of
u  and u . our denition of an adjoint operator in chap. 2 and the induced scalar
product lead to unitary (isometry) operators with respect to that product which will have
properties diering from the usual ones, as we have already seen for self-adjoint operators.
the eigenstates of our unitary operators may not be orthogonal and can contain zero norm
states. this is due to the fact that usual argumentations breaks down, if the eigenvalues
depend on q as in eq. (3.12). so explicitly

< k | m >=

2r1

x

n=0

qn(k+m)

6

(3.13)

what is non-zero for m = k = 0 or m + k = 2r . hence we have only two non-zero norm
states for k = 0 and r and the eigenstates | k > and | 2rk > for k = 1, . . . , r 1 are not
orthogonal. the situation is improved if we remember orthogonal matrices in real space.
indeed u  can be considered as such a matrix. we dene a new basis by combining the
pairs of vectors with indices k and 2r  k to new ones

2r1

| m > =

(reqkn + imqkn) | n >

x

n=0
2r1

| 2rm > =

x

n=0

(reqkn  imqkn) | n >

(3.14)

1  m  r  1

and adding | 0 > and | r > . the new basis is orthogonal and can be normalized. in
that basis we have (after normalization) u t = u 1 and u  contains boxes with sin m
r
and cos m
in the usual way of orthogonal matrices. the situation for u can be read o
r
from eq. (3.7). in general the eigenvalues of our unitary matrices are combinations of
phases and functions of q . keeping in mind all that we can still work with the states
(3.11) as a basis to construct the x eigenstates.

from the algebra (3.1) follows

for 1  k  2r  1 and

x | k >= dk | k1 >

x | 0 >= d0 | 2r1 >

(3.15)

(3.16)

next we have to calculate dk . we apply the conjugate of eq. (3.9) to | k > and nd

dk =

i

0

(e

i

2r qk 1

2  e i

2r qk+ 1
2 )

(3.17)

this formula works for all 0  k  2r  1 . we construct the eigenstates the following
way

x | xm > = xm | xm >

2r1

| xm > =

x

k=0

ak | k >

yielding the recursion relation for the coecients

consistency requires

ak+1 =

xm
dk+1

ak

a0 =

xm
d0

a2r1

7

(3.18)

(3.19)

(3.20)

we can put a0 = 1 and the solution of eqs. (3.19) and (3.20) are

ak = (xm)k(

(xm)2r =

2r

l=1

dl =

i2r
2r0

2r 4 cos2 
2

(3.21)

the r.h.s. of eq. (3.21) is a positive number. the x eigenvalues are given by all roots
of unity (or powers of q ) multiplied by this number in power 1
2r . the states (3.18) are
orthogonal for dierent m . thus we have obtained the same picture for the operator x
as in eq. (3.3) for the operator p , except just one point. for  =  all eigenvalues of
x vanish, moreover x becomes nilpotent, x r = 0 . we know that ordinary hermitean
operators cannot be nilpotent (except the trivial case). looking closer one nds d0 =
dr = 0 and it follows that the (non-orthonormal) system | k > forms its canonical basis.
therefore the whole sitation is connected with the existence of zero-norm states which
are usually not allowed but cannot be forbidden here as explained in chap. 2 .

now we can compare our results with those for real q obtained in papers [5] and [6].
the main dierence is that all our representations have nite dimensions which avoids the
mathematical problems of the real case. also we do not have the two sectors with respect
to the sign of 0 . on the other hand we have to introduce an additional parameter
c (or ) characterizing the representation. as soon as  6=  the operators x and p
are manifestly equivalent in our representation. as far as the degenerate case  =  is
concerned we believe that it is the reection of the fact that the existence of eigenstates of
p with vanishing eigenvalue cannot be excluded from the very beginning as we did with
demanding 0 > 0 .

4 soq(3) deformation in compact space

r

in this chapter we give the representations of the q-deformed algebra (2.8), (2.11) - (2.15)
. we have not written the lax b and lap b relations which are the same as
for q = e
in [1] . we are also not going to repeat the derivations of papers [1] and [7] leading to the
t -operators and explaining the appearance of the clebsch-gordon coecients because on
the algebraic level there are no changes. the changes start as soon as representations are
considered, what shall be done now.
we choose l  l, l3 and x  x as a complete set of commuting variables. one can
proceed as in the undeformed case and exploit eqs. (2.11) and (2.12) . for the angular
momentum the eigenvalues are

l  l | j, m, n >=

q6

(q2  q2)2 (q4j+2 + q4j2  q2  q2) | j, m, n >

8

l3 | j, m, n >= 

q3

(q  q1)

(q2m 

q2j+1 + q2j1

q + q1

) | j, m, n >

(4.1)

(note that the sign of l3
where j and m are integers, |m|  j and 0  j  jmax .
is opposite to the usual one , because we have kept the conventions of paper [1].) for q
being a root of unity we must remember that there are two types of representations, called
types i and ii in paper [3]. we allow only type ii representations for the construction of
the non-commutative space. that the type i representations can be omitted consistently
follows from paper [4]. the type ii representations behave as for q = 1 (and general
real q) except the fact jmax  r
2  1 . the states are fully determined by the quantum
numbers j, m and n . from the rst eq. of (2.13) we read o

x 2 | j, m, n >= l2

0q4n | j, m, n >

(4.2)

it is sucient to choose the integer n as 0  n  r  1 and l0 > 0 . the parameter l0
plays the same role as 0 in the one-dimensional case.

all our representations are unitary and either irreducible or fully reducible [3]. irre-
ducible representations are labelled by the integer j . because of eq. (4.2) we deal with
nite dimensional irreducible representations like in the one-dimensional case before. that
and the existence of a jmax are the main dierences with respect to real q .

the states are normalized in the usual way (this denes our metric). the phase factors

can be choosen to fulll

2 | j, m, n > = q3 | j, m, n + 1 >

(4.3)

from eq. (2.11) the matrix elements of l can be obtained. we mention for further use

w | j, m, n > = {2j + 1}
{1}

| j, m, n >

where we have introduced the abbreviations

{a} = qa + qa
qa  qa
[ a ] =



(4.4)

(4.5)

in papers [1] and [7] one nds how the soq(3) structure can be used to dene reduced
matrix elements for x a and p a . for the non-vanishing matrix elements we qoute the
results

< j + 1, m + 1, n | x + | j, m, n >= qm2jp[j + m + 1] [j + m + 2] < j + 1, n k x  k j, n >
< j  1, m + 1, n | x + | j, m, n >= qm+2j+2p[j  m] [j  m  1] < j  1, n k x  k j, n >
< j + 1, m  1, n | x  | j, m, n >= qmp[j  m + 1] [j  m + 2] < j + 1, n k x  k j, n >

< j + 1, m, n | x 3 | j, m, n >= qmj 1

< j  1, m  1, n | x  | j, m, n >= qmp[j + m] [j + m  1] < j  1, n k x  k j, n >
2p1 + q2p[j  m + 1] [j + m + 1] < j + 1, n k x  k j, n >
2p1 + q2p[j  m] [j + m] < j  1, n k x  k j, n >

< j  1, m, n | x 3 | j, m, n >= qm+j+ 1

(4.6)

the matrix elements on the r.h.s. are the reduced ones. using conjugation properties
(2.10) we have

< j + 1, n k x  k j, n >= q2j+2< j, n k x  k j + 1, n >

(4.7)

therefore only one reduced matrix element has to be determined what is easily obtained
from the rst eq. of (2.3) and (4.2). we x the phase by setting

< j + 1, n k x  k j, n >=

l0qj+2n

p[2] [2j + 1] [2j + 3]

(4.8)

by the way, the rst eq. of (2.3) also tells us that < j, n k x  k j, n > must vanish.
now we come to the matrix elements of p a . based on eqs. (4.6) and (4.7) they are
calculable relying on the matrix elements of the values x  p and its conjugate p  x .
the heisenberg relation (2.15) with the help of the r matrix (2.9) yields after contraction

p  x  q6x  p = 

i
2

 1

2 (1 + q6)(q2 + 1 + q2)w

(4.9)

together with its conjugation eq. (4.9) gives

(4.10)

therefore x  p has matrix elements only between neighbouring n. we consider now
< j, m, n | x  p | j, m, n + 1 >=  q2{[2j + 3] [2j + 2]

< j, n k x  k j + 1, n >< j + 1, n k p  k j, n + 1 >

(4.11)

wj

q5(q2  1)

where the reduced matrix elements of p a are dened analogeous to eqs. (4.6) including
the fact that they are no longer diagonal in n. now it is straightforward to take
< j, m, n + 1 | x  p | j, m, n >=  q2{[2j + 3] [2j + 2]

< j, n + 1 k x  k j + 1, n + 1 >< j + 1, n + 1 k p  k j, n >
+ [2j] [2j  1]

(4.12)

we put in eqs. (4.7) and (4.6) and the conjugation relations

< j + 1, n k p  k j, n + 1 > = q2j+2 < j, n + 1 k p  k j, n >
< j + 1, n + 1 k p  k j, n > = q2j+2 < j, n k p  k j + 1, n + 1 >

(4.13)

the system (4.11) and (4.12) can be rewritten as two recursion relations in j for the two
unknowns, the reduced matrix elements of p . an easy way to solve it , is to start with
j = 0 , read o the general formula and prove it by insertion. for clearness, we present
all non-vanishing reduced matrix elements

< j + 1, n k p  k j, n + 1 > = iqj62nz 1, < j, n + 1 k p  k j + 1, n >= iq3j82nz 1
< j + 1, n + 1 k p  k j, n > = iq3j22nz 1, < j, n k p  k j + 1, n + 1 >= iqj42nz 1 (4.14)
where the common denominator is

z = 2l0p[2] [2j + 1] [2j + 3]

r

neither eq. (4.8) nor eq. (4.14) contains any divergencies because of the condition jmax 
2  1 . if j + 1 exceeds jmax the matrix element simply vanishexs as it does for j  1 = 1
.

our next aim is to calculate the eigenvalues of p 2  p  p . we shall follow the lines
of chap. 3 and start with the denition of a unitary operator

going back to eq. (4.3) we have

u = q3

u | n >=| n  1 >

where we have omitted all quantum numbers which are unchanged. after

we introduce

u | 0 >= ei | r  1 >

u  = ue i

r

u  | n > = | n  1 >

the eigenstates of the operator u  are given by

| k > =

u  | k > = q2k | k >

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

(4.19)

note that the eigenstates for even k can be produced by the operator x 2/l0
times on | 0 > . from the algebra (2.13) follows

2 acting k/2

where we shall calculate dk below. for the p -eigenstates we use the ansatz

p  p | k >= dk | k2 >

p  p | pn > = p2
n | pn >

ak | k >

k=0

eq. (4.20) yields the recursion relation

ak+2 =

(4.20)

(4.21)

(4.22)

now it is necessary to distinguish between even and odd r . in the rst case we obtain
two dierent solutions putting a0 = 1, a1 = 0 and vice versa. they contain either even or
odd numbers of k in the sum (4.21). consistency gives for the eigenvalues

(4.23)

(4.24)

the coecients dk are calculated via the matrix elements of p 2 between the | j, n >
states. we have the same structure as in the rst parts of eqs. (4.11) and (4.12), e.g.

< j, n + 2 | p 2 | j, n >=  q2{[2j + 3] [2j + 2]

< j, n + 2 k p  k j + 1, n + 1 >< j + 1, n + 1 k p  k j, n >
(4.25)
+ [2j[ [2j  1]

terms connected with intermediate states having quantum numbers n  1 .

as soon as the quantum numbers of the r.h.s. ket vector are xed there are no further
non-vanishing matrix elements. now we consider

p 2 | n > = | n >< n | p 2 | n >

+ | n + 2 >< n + 2 | p 2 | n > + | n  2 >< n  2 | p 2 | n >
= | n >< n | p 2 | n >

while dk depends on j p2 , of course, does not. it is remarkable that eq. (4.32) very
much resembles eq. (3.21) derived for the one-dimensional model. the dierence between
(4.32) and (4.33) is due to the dierent role played by  in both cases.

for odd r all eigenvalues of p 2 are given by the r dierent roots of unity (or powers
of q) multiplied by the r.h.s. of eq. (4.33) in power 1/r . for even r any eigenvalue
is degenerated twice, disregarding the obvious degeneration with respect to j and m .
because of the  sign in front (produced by the factor q6 in (4.31)) p2
 contains a phase

and normalizable. (note that this is not true for the | k > states.)

2  1 . all eigenvectors (4.21) are orthogonal

the main dierence to real q is the niteness in dimension for the eigenvector space.

in addition, p 2 becomes nilpotent (and non-diagonalizable) for special , namely  = 
(r even) and  = 0,  (r odd). the reason is the same as mentioned before, the existence
of special zero-norm states. it is interesting to look at the canonical basis for the cases
above. this is done by nding the roots of the r.h.s. of eq. (4.31), which depend on
angular momentum j .

first consider the case r = 4s (s integer). every angle has two zeros, one for even
and one for odd k . the canonical basis of p 2 consists of four series of length s , their
rst members depending on j . we have always (p 2)s = 0 .

the situation for r = 4s + 2 is a little bit more complicated. for j = 0 we have two
series of length s + 1 and two of length 2s . while the length of the rst two grows the
other two shrink for increasing j . at j = s both zeros coincide. we are left with only two
series of length r/2 . for higher j until jmax = 2s the picture expresses mirror symmetry.
therefore (p 2)s+1 = 0 (for j = 0) varies until (p 2)2s+1 = 0 (j = s) and again (p 2)s+1 = 0
(j = 2s).

for odd r the situation is symmetric with respect to  = 0 and  =  . we have
always two series. for j = 0 they have lengths r/2 + 1/2 and r/2  1/2, respectively. for
2 + 1
j = jmax = r/2  3/2 the longer one reaches r  1, the smaller is just 1 . thus (p 2)
(j = 0) varies until (p 2)r1 = 0 (j = jmax).
