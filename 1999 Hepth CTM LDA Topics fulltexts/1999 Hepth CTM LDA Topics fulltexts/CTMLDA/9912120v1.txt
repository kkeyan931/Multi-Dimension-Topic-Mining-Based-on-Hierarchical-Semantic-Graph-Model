abstract

an open superstring eld theory action has been proposed which
does not suer from contact term divergences. in this paper, we com-
pute the on-shell four-point tree amplitude from this action using the
giddings map. after including contributions from the quartic term
in the action, the resulting amplitude agrees with the rst-quantized
prescription.

1 introduction

to study non-perturbative features of superstring theory, a eld theory action
for the superstring could be useful. as shown by wendt in 1989 [1], a cubic
action for open superstring eld theory has divergent contact term problems
due to colliding interaction-point operators. if the neveu-schwarz string eld

a carries picture 1, the cubic action is r (aqa + za3) where z = {q, }

is the picture-raising operator which is inserted at the interaction-point [2].
since z has a singularity with itself, the four-point amplitude computed
using the above action has contact term divergences which break gauge in-
variance and make the action inconsistent. similar contact term problems
exist with other choices of picture [3] and with other open superstring eld
theory actions such as the light-cone and covariantized light-cone actions.[4]
in 1995, an action for open superstring eld theory was proposed which
does not suer from contact term divergences [5]. this action was constructed
by embedding the n=1 superstring into the n=2 superstring and resembles
a wess-zumino-witten action. using modied green-schwarz variables, this
open superstring eld theory action can be written in a manifestly so(3,1)
super-poincare invariant manner [5]. this spacetime-supersymmetric version
of the action is easily generalized to any compactication to four dimensions
which preserves at least n=1 d = 4 supersymmetry. it is also possible to
write this eld theory action using ramond-neveu-schwarz variables and, at
least in the neveu-schwarz sector, this can be done in a manifestly so(9,1)
lorentz invariant manner.

in this paper, we shall use this action to explicitly compute the four-point
open superstring tree amplitude. when the external states are on-shell, this
amplitude will be shown to agree with the rst-quantized result. there are
no contact term divergences, and the quartic vertex plays a crucial role in
cancelling a nite contact term contribution coming from two cubic vertices.
in section 2, we shall review the wess-zumino-witten-like action for open
superstring eld theory. in section 3, we shall discuss gauge xing and the
giddings map for computing four-point amplitudes using open string eld
theory. in section 4, we shall explicitly compute the four-point on-shell tree
amplitude and will prove equivalence with the rst-quantized result.

2 review of superstring field theory action

for any critical (c = 2) n=2 superconformal representation with n=2 gener-
ators [t ,g+,g,j], one can construct the following open string eld theory
action:

1

0

s =

0 e) z 1

2 z [(eg+

0 e)(e g+

dt(ettet)netg+

0 eto].
(1)
which resembles the wess-zumino-witten action r [(g1dg)2 + r dt(g1dg)3].
the open string elds  are glued together using wittens midpoint inter-
action [6] and are restricted to be u(1)-neutral with respect to j. the open
string elds carry chan-paton factors which will be suppressed throughout
this paper.

0 et, et g+

0 and g+

the fermionic operators g+

0 are constructed from the n=2 su-
perconformal generators in the following manner [7]: after twisting, the
fermionic generator g+ carries conformal weight +1 and the fermionic gen-
erator g carries conformal weight +2. furthermore, after bosonizing the
u(1) generator j = h, one can construct su(2) currents [j ++ = eih , j =
h, j  = eih] of conformal weight [0, 1, 2] after twisting. commuting the
zero modes of these su(2) currents with the fermionic generators, one ob-
tains two new fermionic generators, g+ = [g, j ++
], of
conformal weight +1 and +2 respectively. g+
0 is dened to be the zero mode
of g+ and g+
0 } = 0
and after twisting, the u(1) anomaly implies that non-vanishing correlation
functions on a sphere must carry +2 u(1) charge.

0 is dened to be the zero mode of g+. note that {g+

] and g = [g+, j 

0 , g+

0

0

the action of (1) can be justied by considering the following three exam-
ples of critical n=2 superconformal representations. the rst example is the
open self-dual string where  depends on the string modes of the variables
[x , , ] for ,  =1 to 2. for this n=2 superconformal representation,
g+ = x+, g+ = x, and j =  . since there are no massive
physical elds, the dependence of  on the non-zero modes of [x , , ]
gives rise to auxiliary and gauge elds. the massless physical eld comes
from dependence on the zero mode of x , (x 
0 ), which when plugged into
(1) reproduces the donaldson-nair-schi action [8] for d=4 self-dual yang-
mills.

the second example is the n=2 embedding of the superstring using the
standard rns worldsheet variables [x, , b, c, , , ] where  = 0 to 9 and

2

the super-reparameterization ghosts have been fermionized as  = e
and  = e [7]. in this example, the neveu-schwarz contribution to the
eld theory action is obtained by dening  = 0a where a is the standard
neveu-schwarz string eld in the 1 picture. (the ramond contribution to
the superstring eld theory action is not yet known.) in the n=2 embedding
of the superstring, g+
0 is the zero mode of .
so the linearized equation of motion coming from the action of (1) is

0 is the brst charge q and g+

0 = g+
0

g+

0  = q0(0a) = qa

as desired. furthermore, since j = bc + , the u(1)-neutrality condition
implies that  has zero rns ghost-number.

the third example is the hybrid description of the superstring using
the four-dimensional superspace variables [xm, ,  ] where m=0 to 3 and
,  = 1 to 2, combined with a chiral boson  and the variables of a c = 9 n=2
superconformal eld theory which describes a six-dimensional compactica-
tion manifold [9]. in this example, the compactication-independent part of
the eld theory action is obtained by dening  to be a string eld depending
only on the four-dimensional superspace variables. (the compactication-
dependent contribution to the action was worked out in [5] and involves two
other string elds in addition to .) the massless and rst massive level
of this action have been explicitly computed in [5] and [10] and describe a
super-yang-mills and massive spin-2 multiplet in n=1 d = 4 superspace.

3 gauge fixing and the giddings map

similar to the wess-zumino-witten action, the action of (1) is invariant
under the gauge transformation

e = (g+

0 )e + e( g+

0

)

where  and  are arbitrary string elds of 1 u(1)-charge. at linearized
 which allows the
level, this transformation reduces to  = g+
gauge-xing conditions

in this gauge, the linearized propagator is p = (t0)2g

so that g
{g
0 
= 0 is the linearized equation of motion and p g+
0  = . although this
propagator looks complicated, we shall show in section 4 that it can be
simplied to p = (t0)1j 
although the action of (1) contains vertices with arbitrary numbers of
string elds, only the cubic and quartic vertices will be necessary for com-
puting four-point tree amplitudes. expanding the action of (1), one obtains

0 when computing on-shell tree amplitudes.

for four-point tree amplitudes, contributions can come from two cubic

tices connected by a propagator of length  is given by

where the propagator is integrated along the contour c. the witten diagram
for a quartic vertex is given by figure 2 in the limit that   0.
as was shown by giddings [11], it is convenient to perform a schwarz-
christoel transformation from the diagram of gure 2 to the upper half
plane such that the four external strings are mapped to the points ( )
and (( ))1. if strings [(1), (2), (3), (4)] are mapped to the points [, ,
1,1] in this order, then 0 < ( )   where   2  1, ( = 0) = 
and ( = ) = 0. on the other hand, if strings [(1), (2), (3), (4)] are
mapped to the points [1,, , 1] in this order, then   ( ) < 1
where ( = 0) =  and ( = ) = 1.

4 computation of four-point amplitude

the tree-level scattering amplitude for four external string elds labeled by
the letters [a, b, c, d] gets contributions either from the diagram of figure 2
or from the second diagram of figure 1. there are 24 dierent ways to match
the string elds [a, b, c, d] with the external legs [(1), (2), (3), (4)] and we
shall restrict our attention to those 4 combinations where [a, b, c, d] are
cyclically ordered. for contributions coming from the diagram of figure 2,
these 4 combinations split into two s-channel contributions, as, where string
a is associated with leg (2) or leg (4) and two t-channel contributions, at,
where string a is associated with leg (1) or leg (3). the four cyclically related
combinations coming from the quartic vertex of figure 1 will be called aq.
in this section, it will be shown that the sum of these three contributions,
a = as + at + aq, reproduces the rst-quantized result for the on-shell
scattering amplitude which can be written as [7]

(4)

a = z 1
a(1) g+

0

d h (z d2z(z, z)g(z))
0 b() g+

0 c() g+

0 d(1)i.

where (z, z) is the appropriate beltrami dierential for an -dependent
parameterization of the modulus and h i signies the two-dimensional corre-
lation function in the upper half-plane. to relate (4) to the standard expres-
sion for the scattering amplitude of four neveu-schwarz strings, recall from
section 2 that  = 0v (1) where v (1) is the neveu-schwarz vertex opera-
tor in the 1 picture. furthermore, g = b, g+
0  = 00v (1) = v (1) and

5

0  = q0v (1) = v (0) where v (0) is the neveu-schwarz vertex operator in

g+
the zero picture. so (4) implies that

0

a = z 1

which agrees with the rst-quantized prescription of [12] in the large hilbert
space, i.e. in the hilbert space including the  zero mode.

however, for the open superstring four-point amplitude, one rst has to
perform contour deformations of the g+

appear in the same manner as in the expression for as. as will now be shown,
these contour deformations produce a nite contact term which is cancelled
by the contribution from the quartic vertex.

4.3 computation of quartic vertex contribution

it will now be shown that this surface term from  =  is precisely cancelled
by the contribution aq from the quartic vertex. using the action of (3) and
including only contributions with the cyclic order [a, b, c, d],

aq =  xcyclic

0 b()  g+

0 a(1) b())

(11)

(c() g+

0 d(1)  g+

0 c() d(1)) i

where pcyclic denotes a sum over the four cyclic permutations of [a, b, c, d].
using properties of the cyclic sum, the sixteen terms in aq can be reordered
as

aq =  xcyclic
0 b g+

1
24h 2a g+
0 c d  g+

a g+

0 b c g+

0 d

0 a b c g+

0 d i

where we have suppressed the z location of the four external strings. note
that the quartic vertex is invariant under cyclic rotations of these z locations.
deforming the contour of g+ o of c in the second term, one gets

aq =  xcyclic

24h 3a g+

0 b c g+

0 d

(12)

 g+

0 a g+

0 b c d  g+

but the last two terms of (12) cancel each other after summing over cyclic
permutations, so

aq =  xcyclic

8h a g+

0 b c g+

0 d i

1
8h a g+

= 

0 b c g+

where we have used contour deformations of g+ and g+ to write all four
terms in the same form. note that there are no surface term contributions
coming from these deformations due to the cancelled propagator argument
[13] which can be used when  = 0 or  = 1.

so we have proven our claim that, after including the contribution from
the quartic vertex of the action of (1), the second-quantized prescription
agrees with the rst-quantized prescription for on-shell tree-level four-point
open superstring scattering amplitudes.
