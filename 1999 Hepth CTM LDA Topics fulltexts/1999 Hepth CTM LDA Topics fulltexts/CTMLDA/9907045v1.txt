abstract

in recent papers it has been observed that non-hermitian hamiltonians,
such as those describing ig3 and g4 eld theories, still possess real pos-
itive spectra so long as the weaker condition of pt symmetry holds. this
allows for the possibility of new kinds of quantum eld theories that have
strange and quite unexpected properties.
in this paper a technique based
on truncating the schwinger-dyson equations is presented for renormalizing
and solving such eld theories. using this technique it is argued that a g4
scalar quantum eld theory in four-dimensional space-time is renormalizable,
is asymptotically free, has a nonzero value of h0||0i, and has a positive de-
nite spectrum. such a theory might be useful in describing the higgs boson.

i. introduction

it has recently been observed [1,2] that quantum mechanical theories whose hamiltonians
are pt -symmetric have positive denite spectra even if the hamiltonian is not hermitian.
a class of such theories that has been studied extensively is dened by the hamiltonian

h = p2  (ix)n (n  2).

(1.1)

it is believed that the reality and positivity of the spectra are a direct consequence of pt
symmetry.
the positivity of the spectra for all n is an extremely surprising result; it is not at
all obvious, for example, that the hamiltonian h = p2  x4 corresponding to n = 4 has
a positive real spectrum. to understand this result it is necessary to dene properly the
boundary conditions in the corresponding schrodinger equation.

for the hamiltonian in eq. (1.1) the schrodinger dierential equation corresponding to

the eigenvalue problem h = e is

 (x)  (ix)n (x) = e(x).

(1.2)

the boundary conditions for this equation are discussed in detail in ref. [1]. there, it was
shown how to continue analytically in the parameter n away from the harmonic oscillator
value n = 2. this analytic continuation denes the boundary conditions in the complex-x
plane. the regions in the cut complex-x plane in which (x) vanishes exponentially as |x| 
 are wedges. in ref. [1] the wedges for n > 2 were chosen to be analytic continuations of
the wedges for the harmonic oscillator, which are centered about the negative and positive
real axes and have angular opening 
2 . for arbitrary n > 2 the anti-stokes lines at the
centers of the left and right wedges lie below the real axis at the angles

n + 2(cid:19) 

left =  +(cid:18)n  2
n + 2(cid:19) 
right = (cid:18)n  2

n +2. in ref. [1] the time-independent schrodinger
the opening angle of these wedges is
equation was integrated numerically inside the wedges to determine the eigenvalues to high
precision.

the quantum mechanical hamiltonian in eq. (1.1) has additional remarkable properties.
for example, for all n > 2 the expectation value h0|x|0i of the position operator x in the
ground state is nonzero. this surprising result is true even when n = 4 [1].
these results for quantum mechanics raise some interesting questions regarding quantum
eld theory. in particular, does the self-interacting scalar quantum eld theory dened by
the lagrangian

have a positive denite spectrum and a nonvanishing value of h0||0i for all n > 2? we
believe that the answer to this question is yes. because of these properties, we believe that
when n = 4 the resulting quantum eld theory in four-dimensional space-time could serve
as a good description of the higgs particle. as we argue in this paper, the g4 theory is
particularly advantageous because, like the conventional g4 it has a dimensionless coupling
constant, but unlike the conventional theory, it is asymptotically free and is thus not a trivial
theory.

the question of how to determine the properties of pt -symmetric non-hermitian quan-
tum eld theories has already been examined. as we will see in this paper, conventional
feynman diagrammatic perturbation theory is not adequate for studying these theories.
thus, in previous work [3,4] the perturbative approach that was used was to take n = 2 + ,
where  is treated as a small parameter. while some interesting results regarding parity
violation [3] and supersymmetry [4] were obtained, unfortunately this perturbative scheme
has a severe drawback: it is not known how to carry out the renormalization procedure
required to understand higher-dimensional theories.

why is it that feynman diagrams cannot be used to perform calculations in theories
such as g4? as we have already stated, in this theory h0||0i 6= 0. there is no way to
obtain this result using the standard feynman rules; one cannot obtain a one-point greens
function using four-point vertex amplitudes. indeed, as we will show in sec. iii in the context
of zero-dimensional theories, the standard feynman rules are incorrect for this theory.

in this paper we perform a systematic truncation of the schwinger-dyson equations as
a calculational procedure. this idea has already been applied in a simple context to obtain
greens functions and energy levels in conventional quantum mechanical problems [5]. trun-
cating the schwinger-dyson equations is an inherently variational approach; including more
and more of the higher greens functions is equivalent to enlarging the space of variational
parameters. in a recent study of the pt -symmetric, non-hermitian quantum mechanical
hamiltonian in eq. (1.1) variational methods were found to be extremely accurate [6].
this paper is organized as follows: in sec. ii we review the general approach used in
this paper. we show how to derive the schwinger-dyson equations using simple functional
methods and we explain our truncation procedure. in sec. iii we examine the numerical
accuracy of our truncation method in the context of zero-dimensional eld theory. we study
the massless zero-dimensional version of eq. (1.4) in very high order in the truncation process
for the cases n = 3 and n = 4. in the case of a zero-dimensional massive theory we show
that the feynman rules are inapplicable. in sec. iv we examine the theory in eq. (1.4) in
one-dimensional space-time (quantum mechanics). finally, in sec. v we apply our methods
to eld theory in arbitrary dimension. as an application of our procedure we calculate the
callan-symanzik function (g) for a four-dimensional g4 theory for small g. we show
that to leading order (g) is negative and thus the theory is asymptotically free. this result
is in distinct contrast with the result for a conventional g4 theory.

ii. elementary derivation of the schwinger-dyson equations

the schwinger-dyson equations are an innite set of coupled equations relating the
greens functions of a quantum eld theory. in this section we derive the schwinger-dyson

3

equations using elementary formal functional methods.

we begin with eq. (1.4) and append a term that represents the coupling of the eld (x)

to an external c-number source j(x):

l =

1
2

()2 +

1
2

m22 

g
n

(i)n  j.

(2.1)

this lagrangian represents a self-interacting scalar quantum eld theory in d-dimensional
euclidean space-time. if we vary the action with respect to (x) we obtain the eld equation:

 2(x) + m2(x)  ig[i(x)]n 1 = j(x).

(2.2)

next, leaving the source turned on, we take the expectation value of the eld equation
(2.2) in the vacuum state of the theory |0i and divide by the vacuum-vacuum functional
z[j] = h0|0i:

 2g(j)

1 (x) + m2g(j)

1 (x)  gin h0|n 1(x)|0i

h0|0i

= j(x),

(2.3)

where g(j)

1 (x) is the one-point greens function in the presence of the external source:

1 (x)  h0|(x)|0i
g(j)
h0|0i

.

(2.4)

note that the function j(x) appears alone on the right side of eq. (2.3) because it is a
c-number and therefore can be factored out of matrix elements.

the objective is now to use eq. (2.3) to calculate the greens functions of the theory.
the (connected) greens functions in the presence of the source j are dened as functional
derivatives of the logarithm of z[j] with respect to the source j(x):

g(j)
n (x1, x2, . . . , xn) 

n

j(x1)j(x2)    j(xn)

ln(z[j]).

(2.5)

to obtain the standard connected greens functions of the theory (the connected part of the
vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of the elds; that is, the sum of the
connected n-point feynman diagrams) we then turn o the source:

gn(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = g(j)

.

(2.6)

n (x1, x2, . . . , xn) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)j0

note that turning o the source restores translation invariance. as a result, the one-point
greens function g1 is a constant independent of x, the two-point greens function depends
only on the dierence x  y, g2(x, y) = g2(x  y), g3(x, y, z) = g3(x  y, x  z) depends
on two dierences, and so on.
before one can proceed, one must express the third term in eq. (2.3) in terms of the con-
nected greens functions of the theory. to do this we recall that functionally dierentiating
with respect to j(x) is equivalent to inserting (x) in matrix elements [5].

let us consider the simple case n = 3.

in this case it is necessary to calculate the

quantity h0|2(x)|0i. to do so we begin with eq. (2.4) multiplied by z[j]:

4

taking the functional derivative of this equation with respect to j(x) gives

g(j)
1 (x)z[j] = h0|(x)|0i.

[g(j)

1 (x)]2z[j] + g(j)

2 (x, x)z[j] = h0|2(x)|0i.

hence, we can eliminate h0|2(x)|0i from eq. (2.3) to obtain
1 (x)]2 + g(j)

1 (x) + m2g(j)

 2g(j)

1 (x) + gi(cid:16)[g(j)

2 (x, x)(cid:17) = j(x).

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

we now obtain the rst of the schwinger-dyson equations by setting j  0 (turning o the
source):

m2g1 + gihg2
remember that by translation invariance g1 is a constant, so that its derivative vanishes
and that g2(0) = g2(x  x) = g2(x, x).
derivative of eq. (2.9) with respect to j(y),

to obtain the second of the schwinger-dyson equations for n = 3 we take a functional

1 + g2(0)i = 0.

(2.10)

2 (x, y) + m2g(j)

 2g(j)
and then set j  0 in this equation:

2 (x, y) + gih2g(j)

1 (x)g(j)

2 (x, y) + g(j)

3 (x, x, y)i = (x  y),

(2.11)

 2g2(x  y) + m2g2(x  y) + gi [2g1g2(x  y) + g3(0, x  y)] = (x  y).
if we continue the process of functionally dierentiating with respect to j and setting
j  0, we obtain the innite tower of coupled dierential equations known as the schwinger-
dyson equations. for example, the third in the sequence is

(2.12)

2g3(x  y, x  z) + m2g3(x  y, x  z)

+gi[2g1g3(x  y, x  z) + 2g2(x  z)g2(x  y) + g4(0, x  y, x  z)] = 0.

(2.13)

note that these schwinger-dyson equations are incomplete in the sense that there are
too many unknowns. the rst equation contains g1 and g2, the second contains g1, g2,
and g3, and so on. thus, each new equation contains a new unknown greens function
and the system never closes. however, we can force the system to close by truncating the
sequence of coupled equations and setting gn+1 = 0 in the last equation. we will use this
method throughout the remainder of the paper.

as a second example we derive the rst four schwinger-dyson equations from eq. (2.3)
for the case n = 4. using the same approach as we did for the case n = 3, we begin by
reexpressing h0|3(x)|0i. we do this by taking the functional derivative of eq. (2.8) with
respect to j(x) to obtain

[g(j)

1 (x)]3z[j] + 3g(j)

1 (x)g(j)

2 (x, x)z[j] + g(j)

3 (x, x, x)z[j] = h0|3(x)|0i.

(2.14)

substituting this result into the n = 4 version of eq. (2.3), we have

5

1 (x) + m2g(j)

 2g(j)
we obtain the rst schwinger-dyson equation for n = 4 by setting j  0:

1 (x)  g(cid:16)[g(j)

1 (x)]3 + 3g(j)

2 (x, x) + g(j)

1 (x)g(j)

3 (x, x, x)(cid:17) = j(x). (2.15)

m2g1  ghg3

1 + 3g1g2(0) + g3(0, 0)i = 0.

(2.16)

using the same procedure as for n = 3 we now take a functional derivative of eq. (2.15)

with respect to j(y) to obtain

2g(j)
+3g(j)

2 (x, y) + m2g(j)
1 (x)g(j)

2 (x, y)  g(cid:16)3[g(j)
2 (x, x)g(j)

1 (x)]2g(j)

2 (x, y)
2 (x, y) +g(j)

3 (x, x, y) + 3g(j)

4 (x, x, x, y)(cid:17) = (x  y).
now, setting j  0 gives the second of the schwinger-dyson equations for n = 4:

2g2(x  y) + m2g2(x  y)  g[3g2

1g2(x  y)

+3g2(0)g2(x  y) + 3g1g3(0, x  y) + g4(0, 0, x  y)] = (x  y).

(2.17)

(2.18)

repeating this process once more by functionally dierentiating eq. (2.17) with respect

to j(z) and setting j  0 gives

2g3(x  y, x  z) + m2g3(x  y, x  z)

g[6g1g2(x  y)g2(x  z) + 3g2
+3g2(x  z)g3(0, x  y) + 3g2(x  y)g3(0, x  z) + 3g2(0)g3(x  y, x  z)
+3g1g4(0, x  y, x  z) + g5(0, 0, x  y, x  z)] = 0,

1g3(x  y, x  z)

(2.19)

the third of the schwinger-dyson equations for n = 4. the fourth schwinger-dyson equa-
tion is

2g4(x  y, x  z, x  w) + m2g4(x  y, x  z, x  w)

g[6g2(x  y)g2(x  z)g2(x  w) + 6g1g2(x  y)g3(x  z, x  w)
+6g1g2(x  z)g3(x  y, x  w) + 6g1g2(x  w)g3(x  y, x  z)
+3g3(0, x  y)g3(x  z, x  w) + 3g3(0, x  z)g3(x  y, x  w)
+3g3(0, x  w)g3(x  y, x  z) + 3g2
+3g2(x  y)g4(0, x  z, x  w) + 3g2(x  z)g4(0, x  y, x  w)
+3g2(x  w)g4(0, x  y, x  z) + 3g2(0)g4(x  y, x  z, x  w)
+3g1g5(0, x  y, x  z, x  w) + g6(0, 0, x  y, x  z, x  w)] = 0.

1g4(x  y, x  z, x  w)

(2.20)

again, we observe that the set of equations is incomplete; for this case the number of
unknown greens functions is two more than the number of equations (instead of one more
as in the case n = 3). that is, the rst equation for n = 4 contains the three unknowns
g1, g2, and g3, the second contains g1, g2, g3, and g4, and so on. to solve this system
of equations we truncate after the nth equation, but now to close the system of equations
we must set gn+1 = 0 and gn+2 = 0 in the last and next to last equations.

how do we generalize this derivation to arbitrary n? clearly, when n is an integer and
n > 2 we can use the two cases n = 3 and n = 4 discussed above as paradigms. all that

6

is needed is to functionally dierentiate eq. (2.7) n  2 times. this gives an expression for
h0|n 1(x)|0i in eq. (2.3). for example, when n = 5 we have

z[j](cid:16)[g(j)
+4g(j)

1 (x)]4 + 6[g(j)
1 (x)g(j)

1 (x)]2g(j)
3 (x, x, x) +g(j)

2 (x, x)]2

2 (x, x) + 3[g(j)
4 (x, x, x, x)(cid:17) = h0|4(x)|0i,

when n = 6, we have

(2.21)

(2.22)

z[j](cid:16)[g(j)
+10[g(j)
+5g(j)

1 (x)]5 + 10[g(j)
1 (x)]2g(j)
1 (x)g(j)

4 (x, x, x, x) + g(j)

1 (x)]3g(j)

2 (x, x) + 15g(j)

1 (x)[g(j)

2 (x, x)]2

3 (x, x, x) + 10g(j)

2 (x, x)g(j)

3 (x, x, x)

5 (x, x, x, x, x)(cid:17) = h0|5(x)|0i,

and so on. once this calculation is completed, repeated functional dierentiation with
respect to j followed by setting j  0 gives the complete set of coupled greens function
equations.
note that while these equations are rather complicated, they are easily expressible in
terms of multinomial coecients. following the notation of abramowitz and stegun [7],
the multinomial coecients are dened as follows: for each integer n, there is a set of
multinomial coecients; each coecient expresses the number of possible ways to par-
tition n = a1 + 2a2 + . . . + nan dierent objects into ak subsets containing k objects
(k = 1, 2,
. . . , n). for the rst few integers n the sets of multinomial coecients (called
m3 in ref. [7]) are {1} for n = 1, {1, 1} for n = 2, {1, 3, 1} for n = 3, {1, 4, 3, 6, 1} for
n = 4, and {1, 5, 10, 10, 15, 10, 1} for n = 5. observe that these are precisely the coecients
that appear in (2.7) for h0|(x)|0i, (2.8) for h0|2(x)|0i, (2.14) for h0|3(x)|0i, (2.21) for
h0|4(x)|0i, and (2.22) for h0|5(x)|0i. also, in these equations the powers of the greens
functions are the numbers ak.
to be precise, for each n we must take all possible combinations of the numbers ak
satisfying n = a1 + 2a2 + . . . + nan. in the notation of ref. [7],  = 1a1, 2a2, . . . , nan. this
allows us to read o the subscripts of the greens functions and the powers to which they are
raised; the numbers ak are the powers and the numbers they exponentiate are the subscripts
of the greens functions in that term. from this we calculate the quantity

m3 = (n; a1, a2, . . . , an) =

n!

(1!)a1a1!(2!)a2a2! . . . (n!)anan!

,

(2.23)

which is the coecient for that particular combination of greens functions.

for example, given h0|3(x)|0i there are three possible combinations of the numbers ak
that satisfy n = a1 + 2a2 + . . . + nan: a1 = 3; a1 = 1 and a2 = 1; and a3 = 1. this
gives  = 13;  = 1, 2; and  = 3. thus, there are terms of the form g3
1, g1g2, and g3.
calculating m3 we nd that the coecients of these terms are 1, 3, and 1. hence, we are
able to reconstruct eq. (2.14).

when n is noninteger, the situation is much more dicult. to derive an expression for
h0|n 1(x)|0i in this case, we assume rst that n is integer and use the general formula
for h0|n 1(x)|0i in terms of multinomial coecients. then, in principle, we can continue
analytically o the integers using analytical expressions in terms of gamma functions for
these multinomial coecients.

7

of course, this procedure is complicated, but we illustrate it below by considering the
simplest truncation possible in which we keep only the rst two schwinger-dyson equations
and set gn = 0 for all n > 2. in this case, for integer values of n we have the beautiful
result that the only multinomial coecients that appear are precisely the coecients of the
hermite polynomials. thus, for noninteger values of n we have parabolic cylinder functions
with the exponential divided o. it is in this fashion that we are able to continue o the
integers n.

to be explicit, we use the standard notation d(x) to represent the parabolic cylinder

function [8] and dene the function w(x) by

d(x) = ex2/4xw(x).

(2.24)

then, for integer n we factor [g(j)
variables (j) and  by

1 ]n out of the equation for h0|n (x)|0i and introduce the

(j) =

1 (x)

ig(j)
qg(j)

2 (x, x)

and  =

.

ig1

qg2(0)

we then obtain for arbitrary noninteger n

(n  2k)!2kk![(j)]2k .

(2.25)

(2.26)

(this series terminates if n is integer but is an innite series if n is noninteger.) as we will
see, when j  0, the constant g1 is a negative imaginary number and the constant g2(0) is
real and positive. thus, the argument  of wn is real and positive.
using eq. (2.26) we write the eld equation (2.3) explicitly in terms of the greens

functions of the theory:

 2g(j)

1 (x) + m2g(j)

1 (x)  gin [g(j)

1 (x)]n 1wn 1((j)) = j(x).

(2.27)

(remember that in the derivation of this equation we have discarded all greens functions
higher than g2.) as before, we obtain the rst of the greens functions for arbitrary n by
setting the source j  0:

m2g1  gin gn 1

1 wn 1() = 0.

(2.28)

we obtain the second of the schwinger-dyson equations for arbitrary n by taking the

functional derivative of eq. (2.27) with respect to j(y):

2g(j)

2 (x, y) + m2g(j)
gin (n  1)[g(j)
1 (x)]n 1w

3 = 0. now, setting j  0 in the above equation yields the second of

where we have set g(j)
the schwinger-dyson equations:

this equation can be simplied by using the recurrence relations for parabolic cylinder

functions [8],

xw

n 1(x) = (n  1)[wn 2(x)  wn 1(x)],

(2.31)

to obtain
 2g2(x  y) + m2g2(x  y) + (n  1)g(ig1)n 2wn 2()]g2(x  y) = (x  y).
thus, eq. (2.28) and eq. (2.32) are a closed system of two equations and two unknowns.
the solution of this system for various choices of space-time dimension will be discussed in
the following sections.

(2.32)

iii. zero-dimensional theories

in zero-dimensional space-time the integral representation for the vacuum-vacuum func-

tional z[j] corresponding to the lagrangian in eq. (1.4) is an ordinary integral

(3.1)

to demonstrate the numerical accuracy of our truncation method we rst study massless
theories of the form in eq. (3.1) where all quantities are exactly calculable. we nd that for
arbitrary n the greens functions can be expressed exactly in terms of gamma functions.
then, we examine massive theories and show that weak-coupling diagrammatic methods are
inadequate for the analysis of pt -symmetric theories.

using eq. (2.8) with j  0 we express the two-point connected greens function as g2 =
h0|2(x)|0i/h0|0i g2
1, which can be calculated exactly using the two equations given above.
observe that for any n  2, g1 is pure imaginary and negative and g2 is real and
positive, as claimed earlier. this is in fact true in any dimension. the reality of g2 and
the imaginarity of g1 follows from the pt symmetry of these quantities. applying p to g1
changes the sign, while applying p to g2 leaves the sign intact. hence, under t , which acts
as complex conjugation, g1 changes sign again and thus is pure imaginary, while g2 does
not change sign and thus is real.

the rst truncation approximations to g1 and g2 obtained by keeping just the rst two
schwinger-dyson equations are found by solving the zero-dimensional massless versions of
eqs. (2.28) and (2.32). observe that with m = 0, eq. (2.28) demands that

wn 1() = 0.

(3.4)

in zero-dimensional space-time there are no derivatives with respect to x and the delta
function is unity. thus, all schwinger-dyson equations are algebraic. the second schwinger-
dyson equation is

(n  1)g(ig1)n 2wn 2(0)g2 = 1,

where 0 is the solution of eq. (3.4). (note that there is some ambiguity with regard to
which zero to choose. our numerical studies suggest that the most positive zero is always
the correct choice, but we do not have a proof. we nd that it is this zero that gives the
most accurate numerical results.) recalling the denition of , we insert g2 = g2
0 to
obtain an expression for g1:

g1 = i"

(n  1)gwn 2(0)#1/n

again using the denition of , we express g2 as

.

(3.5)

(3.6)

table i compares the exact results with the corresponding rst approximations for n = 3,
n = 4, and n = 5.

deriving an expression for the second approximation in terms of n is dicult. however,
for a specic n, solving larger and larger systems of schwinger-dyson equations in which
more and more greens functions are included can be done symbolically on a computer.
the case n = 3 is comparatively simple. if we keep n equations, then for k < n, the kth
equation is linear in gk+1. thus, we can systematically solve a sequence of linear equations
for the greens functions, substitute the results into the nth equation, and solve the resulting
polynomial equation for g1.

for n = 3, the rst six approximations to ig1g1/3 are 0.79370, 0.69336, 0.74690, 0.71256,
0.73987, and 0.71237. the exact answer, taken from eq. (3.2) with n = 3, is 0.72901 (see
table i). note that the approximations oscillate around the correct answer. for the case
of a hermitian hamiltonian we would expect that the approach to the correct answer is

10

monotone. this is because the calculation that we are performing is variational in nature.
keeping more and more greens functions corresponds to enlarging the parameter space.
however, in this case the hamiltonian is not hermitian, so this oscillation is not surprising.
indeed, it is consistent with our variational studies of pt -symmetric quantum mechanical
systems in ref. [6].
apart from the oscillations, we would hope that successive approximations would come
closer to the correct value. thus, the fact that the sixth approximation is worse than the
fth and that eventually most of the approximations become complex is a startling result.
we believe that this is also due to the non-hermiticity of the hamiltonian. indeed, while
these approximations are numerically extremely accurate, we nd that the convergence is
rather slow and it may even be that this truncation method does not converge. to examine
the convergence we have numerically solved very large systems of coupled schwinger-dyson
equations for n = 3; we have plotted in fig. 1 all solutions for the one-point greens function
in the complex plane for the system of 150 coupled schwinger-dyson equations that lie near
the exact answer. in this gure we see that the algebraic solutions for the one-point greens
function form a very small loop around the exact value. the largest dimension of the loop is
along the real axis and is approximately 0.04. the furthest distance of a point on the loop
from the correct answer is approximately 0.034. a weighted average of the points on the
loop is extremely close to the correct answer 0.72901.

the case n = 4 is more complicated than that of n = 3 because now the last two
schwinger-dyson equations, rather than just the last equation, are nonlinear. as a result
the largest number of equations we can solve and hence, the largest number of greens func-
tions we can include, is ten. the rst ve approximations to ig1g1/4 are 1.10668, 0.90560,
1.02988, 0.96159, and 1.02868. the exact value is 0.97774 (see table i). just as for n = 3,
the approximations oscillate around the exact answer and successive approximations are nu-
merically accurate but appear to converge very slowly. in this case, the fth approximation
is worse than the fourth. we have plotted in fig. 2 all solutions of the rst ten coupled
schwinger-dyson equations for the one-point greens function that lie near the exact an-
swer. as in the case of fig. 1 these solutions form a small loop in the complex plane around
the exact answer.

the numerical work that we have done on zero-dimensional massless theories suggests
that solving systems of truncated schwinger-dyson equations gives extremely accurate nu-
merical approximations to the greens functions. the convergence of the method is still not
understood and warrants further study.

b. massive theories in zero dimensions

in zero-dimensional space-time, massless theories are so simple that it is possible to solve
the schwinger-dyson equations as algebraic systems. however, in higher dimensions, the
coupled schwinger-dyson equations are quite complicated. thus, we will be interested in
obtaining perturbative solutions for the case of small coupling constant g.

to gain a rudimentary understanding of the perturbative nature of the theories in
eq. (1.4), we study in this subsection the path-integral expressions for the n-point dis-
connected greens functions fn of a zero-dimensional g4 eld theory. these disconnected

11

greens functions are expressed as ratios of integrals:

 d n exp(cid:16) 1
fn = r 
 d exp(cid:16) 1
r 

4 4(cid:17)
2 m22 + g
4 4(cid:17)
2 m22 + g

.

(3.7)

although these integrals cannot be done exactly, we can use the method of steepest
descents to obtain an asymptotic result for small g with m xed. we will see that, depending
on whether the sign of m2 is positive or negative, we obtain drastically dierent results.

we begin by replacing  by the dimensional quantity x according to  = q2/g|m|x.

this gives

fn =   2|m|2

g !n/2 r 
 dx xn exp[(x2  x4)]
r 
 dx exp[(x2  x4)]

,

(3.8)

where  = m4/g is a large positive parameter as g  0 and we have distinguished between
the two cases m2 > 0 and m2 < 0.
to calculate the integrals in eq. (3.7) asymptotically, we nd the stationary points of

the function (x) in the exponent, where

(x) = x2  x4.

(3.9)

setting the derivative of this function equal to zero gives the solutions x = 0,  1/2 for
m2 > 0 and x = 0,  i/2 for m2 < 0. these stationary points are shown on figs. 3 and 4.

next, we nd the paths of steepest ascent and descent that pass through these stationary
points. substituting x = u + iv into eq. (3.9) and separating the real and imaginary parts
yields

(u + iv) = (u2  v2)  u4  v4 + 6u2v2 + i[2uv  4uv(u2  v2)].

(3.10)

thus, the paths along which im  = 0 are given by u = 0, v 6= 0; v = 0, u 6= 0; and
u2 = v2  1/2, where the  depends on the sign of m2.
to determine whether each of these paths is a steepest ascent or descent path, we perform
a local analysis of the paths at each of the saddle points. the results of this analysis are
displayed in figs. 3 and 4. the stationary phase contour is chosen such that the boundary
conditions are obeyed. using eq. (1.3), we choose the end points that lie below the real axis

at the angles /6 and 5/6. for m2 > 0 the contour follows the path u = qv2 + 1/2
from the lower left quadrant of the complex-x plane up to the stationary point at 1/2,
then goes along the real axis from 1/2 through the stationary points at the origin and
at 1/2, and nally leaves the point 1/2 and follows the path u = qv2 + 1/2 down to
v = qu2 + 1/2, which passes through the stationary point at i/2.

the lower right quadrant of the complex-x plane. for m2 < 0 the contour follows the path

now, we determine the disconnected greens functions fn for both the m2 > 0 and
m2 < 0 cases by evaluating the integrals in eq. (3.8) along the appropriate stationary phase
contours. for m2 > 0 the greens functions with odd subscript vanish (by oddness) along
the part of the contour that lies on the real axis. evaluating the integrals asymptotically

12

along the remaining parts of the contour gives an exponentially small result; apart from a
multiplicative constant

f2n+1  gn1/2e/4

(g  0+).

(3.11)

the dominant contribution to greens functions of even subscript comes from the portion of
the contour along the real axis. evaluating the integrals near the saddle point at the origin,
we nd that the small-g behavior of these greens functions is given by

f2n  m2n

(g  0+),

(3.12)

apart from a multiplicative constant. note that the greens functions with even subscript
behave very dierently than the greens functions with odd subscript. further, notice that
the behavior of the greens functions with odd subscript is inherently non-perturbative
and, as a result, feynman perturbative methods cannot be used to calculate these greens
functions.

for m2 < 0 the dominant contribution to all of the greens functions comes from the

saddle point at i/2. as a result, all of the greens functions exhibit similar behavior.

to be specic, we have

fn  (i)n|m|ngn/2

(g  0+).

(3.13)

thus, once again, it is clear that these results cannot be obtained using feynman diagrams.
as we will see in sec. v this theory is also the one that is asymptotically free in four
dimensions and the more interesting of the two cases.

iv. numerical study of one-dimensional theories

our success with zero-dimensional massless theories prompts us to study one-dimensional
(quantum mechanical) massless theories of the form in eq. (1.4). numerical computations
have been performed in one-dimension which allow us to compare with exact numbers [1].
in analogy with the last section, we nd the rst approximation to g1 and g2 by solving
the one-dimensional massless versions of eqs. (2.28) and (2.32). observe that with m = 0
we obtain eq. (3.4) once again. in fact, eq. (3.4) holds independent of the dimension. the
second schwinger-dyson equation is given by

 2g2(x  y) + (n  1)g(ig1)n 2wn 2(0)g2(x  y) = (x  y).

(4.1)

this equation depends on the dimension d through the partial derivative. if we introduce
the variable m dened by m 2 = (n  1)g(ig1)n 2wn 2(0), it is clear that eq. (4.1) is just
the equation for the feynman propagator, whose solution in one-dimension can be written

g2(x  y) =

1
2m

e|xy|.

(4.2)

consequently, g2(0) = 1/(2m). recalling the denition of  we use g2(0) = g2
did in the previous section to obtain an expression for g1:

1/2

0 as we

13

g1 = i"

4
0

4(n  1)gwn 2(0)#1/(n +2)

.

(4.3)

substituting g1 into our expression for m yields

(n  1)gwn 2(0)  02!n 2
m = 



2/(n +2)

,

(4.4)

which further allows us to write g2(0) as

2/(n +2)

.

(4.5)

g2(0) =

1

2 


1

g(n  1)wn 2(0)   02!2n


for eld theories, m represents the renormalized mass, which is nothing more than the
dierence in energy between the rst excited state and the ground state e1  e0. table ii
compares the exact values of m and g1 with the corresponding rst approximations for the
cases n = 3, n = 4, and n = 5. (here, we must set g = n/2 and multiply m by 2 to
match the lagrangians studied in ref. [1].)

in one dimension it is dicult to obtain the second approximation, even for a specic
n, because it requires solving coupled systems of nonlinear dierential equations. as in
the previous section, the easiest case to study is n = 3. the rst three schwinger-dyson
equations are given in sec. i as eqs. (2.10), (2.12), and (2.13) with m = 0. to close this
system of equations we set g4 = 0 and z = y. then, the third schwinger-dyson equation
becomes

 2g3(x  y) + gi[2g1g3(x  y) + 2g2

2(x  y)] = 0.

(4.6)

next, we fourier transform the second and third schwinger-dyson equations to obtain

(p2 + m 2) g2(p) + gi g3(p) = 1

and

(p2 + m 2) g3(p) + 2giz 



dq
2

g2(q) g2(p  q) = 0,

(4.7)

(4.8)

where we have used the same denition of m as above, the convolution property of fourier
transforms, and the translation invariance of greens functions g3(0, x y) = g3(x y, x
y) = g3(x  y).

we now solve for g2(p) and obtain

g2(p) =

1

p2 + m 2 

2g2

(p2 + m 2)2 z 



dq
2

g2(q) g2(p  q).

(4.9)

the simplest approach to solving this nonstandard integral equation is to iterate it to
high order in the small parameter g. this iterative procedure can be represented in terms
of diagrams. these diagrams all have a similar structure: they begin with one line that

14

branches into two lines. this branching process continues until the maximum number of
lines is attained. then the process is reversed, with lines combining in pairs until only one
line remains. we were able to perform the calculations symbolically on a computer. we
calculated the propagator to order o(g10); the rst three terms in the expansion are

g2(p) =

1

p2 + m 2 

2g2

m(p2 + m 2)2(p2 + 4m 2)2
(456m 4 + 70m 2p2 + 4p4)g4

+

9m 6(p2 + m 2)2(p2 + 4m 2)2(p2 + 9m 2)

+ o(g6).

(4.10)

now that we have g2(p) to high order in g, we make the ansatz that it can be expressed

in the form

g2(p) =

z1

p2 + m 2
1

+

z2

p2 + m 2
2

+

z3

p2 + m 2
3

+ . . . ,

(4.11)

where mn = nm + b1,ng2 + b2,ng4 + b3,ng6 + . . ., z1 = 1 + a1,1g2 + a2,1g4 + a3,1g6 + . . .,
z2 = a1,2g2+a2,2g4+a3,2g6+. . ., z3 = a2,3g4+a3,3g6+. . ., and so on. by matching this ansatz
to our calculation, we determine the coecients ak,n and bk,n. [the expansion of the ansatz
does not exactly match the expansion of our calculation. this is easily understood because
our calculation for g2(p) only involves special diagrams described above, while the ansatz
involves all types of diagrams. however, the system of equations is neither overdetermined
nor underdetermined, so all coecients may still be calculated.]

the series for the mn are

9641179g10
5598720m 24 ,

98287g8
93312m 19 +
33161g8
279936m 19 ,

m1 = m +

m2 = 2m +

m3 = 3m +

m4 = 4m +

m5 = 5m +

72m 9 +
11g4
108m 9 +
29g4
216m 9 +
109g4
270m 9 ,

(4.12)

since we now have expressions for mn in terms of m, we need only determine m ac-
curately to nish the calculation. this is done using the rst schwinger-dyson equation
(2.10), which implies that

observe that

m 4 = 4g2g2(0).

g2(0) = z 



dp
2

g2(p).

(4.13)

(4.14)

so, based on our calculation of the rst three terms above, the rst few terms are

15

g2(0) =

1
2m 

g2
9m 6 +

7g4
96m 11 .

this allows us to express m and g as

m 2 = q4g2g2(0)
= s 2g2
m 

4g4
9m 6 +

7g6
24m 11 + o(g8).

(4.15)

(4.16)

keeping terms to order o(g10) we obtain m = 1.126151g2/5.

with this value of m, the mn become numerical series multiplied by an overall factor
of g2/5. successive terms in this numerical series decrease in magnitude and thus the series
appears to be convergent. to compare with the numerical results and match the lagrangian
in ref. [1], we set g = 3/2 and multiply the mn by 2; results are given in table iii.

v. schwinger-dyson equations in d dimensions

in this section we show how to solve truncated systems of schwinger-dyson equations in
d dimensions. first, we consider the case d < 2, in which it is not necessary to perform
any renormalization. then we consider the case of arbitrary d, in which it is necessary to
discuss renormalization.

a. schwinger-dyson equations for d < 2

in this subsection we solve eqs. (2.28) and (2.32) in arbitrary dimension d with m = 0.

this calculation is a straightforward generalization of the one for d = 1.

as previously stated, when m = 0, eq. (2.28) implies eq. (3.4). in addition eq. (2.32)

continues to imply eq. (4.1),

 2g2(x  y) + m 2g2(x  y) = (x  y),

in which we have dened the renormalized mass m 2 by

m 2 = gin (n  1)gn 2

1 wn 2(0).

(5.1)

(5.2)

equation (5.1) is just the dierential equation satised by the feynman propagator.

we solve these two equations in arbitrary dimension d by taking the fourier transform

to obtain the propagator:

g2(p) = 1/(p2 + m 2).

(5.3)

fourier transforming this propagator back to position space and then setting x = y gives

g2(0) = m d2(1  d/2)d/22d.

(5.4)

using eqs. (2.25) and (5.2) we solve for g1:

16

g1 = in[(n  1)gwn 2(0)](d2)/2(1  d/2)(4)d/22

0o2/(n d+2n +2d)

substituting this result into eq. (5.2) yields

.

(5.5)

m =n [(n  1)gwn 2(0)]2 h (1  d/2)(4)d/22

0 in 2o1/(n d+2n +2d)

,

(5.6)

and substituting the last two results into eq. (5.4) gives an expression for g2. these expres-
sions reduce to the zero-dimensional and one-dimensional solutions given in the previous
two sections. notice that each of these expressions becomes singular at d = 2.

using these approximate solutions we can determine the large-n behavior of the greens
functions as n  . to do so, we need to determine the asymptotic behavior of the
zeros of the parabolic cylinder function. according to ref. [9], the largest zero of wn1()
for large n is given by 0  2n. substituting this into the integral representation for
wn2() and using eq. (2.31) we perform a steepest-descent calculation to obtain wn2 
q2/31/6(1/3)2nn1/6en/2. we have veried these results numerically to high accuracy.
taking n   in the expressions for g1, g2, and m above and using the asymptotic results
for the parabolic cylinder function, we obtain

g1  2i/e = 1.21306i,
g2  1/(ne),
m 2  he(1  d/2)(4)d/2ni2/(2d)

.

(5.7)

observe that g1 is independent of both n and d to this order, g2 depends on n but
not on d, and m 2 depends on both n and d. these results are valid for large n for all
d < 2. these properties are evident in zero dimensions from eqs. (3.2) and (3.3). while the
behavior of g1 and h0|2(0)|0i is correctly predicted, the behavior of g2 is not because the
rst-order behaviors of g1 and h0|2(0)|0i cancel, leaving a second-order term to describe
g2. also, this calculation predicts that m 2 increases like n 2/(2d). that is, for large n the
separation between the energy levels diverges and hence, the energy levels must diverge. in
d = 1 our approximation suggests that m grows like n. in fact, m grows like n 2 in d = 1
as discussed in ref. [10]. this is the simplest possible truncation, but it suggests the correct
behavior.

b. perturbative renormalization of the schwinger-dyson equations in

d-dimensions and leading-order calculation of the beta function

let us rst consider the pt -symmetric ig3 theory in six space-time dimensions. the
greens functions for that theory are governed by the system of equations beginning with
eq. (2.10), (2.12), and (2.13). let us seek a perturbative solution to this system of equations
in which gn  gn2. in leading order we have rst, from eq. (2.10),

g1 = i

m2
g

.

(5.8)

then, from eq. (2.12), the two-point function in momentum-space is

17

where

g2(p) = z d6x eip(xy)g2(x  y) =

1

p2 + m 2 ,

m 2 = m2 + 2igg1 = m2.

(5.9)

(5.10)

thus, in order to avoid unphysical singularities, we must have for this type of solution
m2 < 0. the leading solution to eq. (2.13) is

g3(p, q) =

2ig

(p2 + m 2)(q2 + m 2)[(p + q)2 + m 2]

,

(5.11)

which has an obvious interpretation as a vertex with three external lines.

more generally, the solution to eq. (2.10) is

g1 =

1

2 (cid:20)im2/g  iq(m2/g)2 + 4g2(0)(cid:21) ,

which corresponds in the perturbative case, where |g2(0)|  (m2/g)2, to

g1 = (

i m2
g ,
m2 g2(0).

i g

(5.12)

(5.13)

the second solution given in eq. (5.13) corresponds to the usual perturbative tadpole con-
tribution to the vacuum expectation value of the eld, while the rst is the new, nontrivial
solution given in eq. (5.8).

perturbatively solving the next in the sequence of schwinger-dyson equations, we obtain

for the four-point function in leading order

g4(p, q, r) =

((p + q + r)2 + m 2)(p2 + m 2)(q2 + m 2)(r2 + m 2)

2ig

"

1

(p + q)2 + m 2 +

1

(p + r)2 + m 2 +

1

(q + r)2 + m 2# .

(5.14)

inserting this back into eq. (2.13), we obtain the one-loop correction to the three-point
function. apart from a tadpole term, this is just the same as that found in the conventional
3 theory; correspondingly, the beta function is obtained from that in the conventional
theory by the replacement g  ig (see, for example, ref. [11])

(g) = 

g


=

3

2 (cid:18) g

4(cid:19)3

,

(5.15)

where g() is the running coupling at scale . unlike the usual 3
theory given here is not asymptotically free.

6 theory, the pt symmetric
4 theory is of far greater interest. in particular, it plays a crucial role in
the standard model as the origin of particle masses through the higgs mechanism. yet the

of course, the 4

18

triviality of that theory is a source of diculty. what happens here, when we set n = 4 in
eq. (1.1)?

the rst few schwinger-dyson equations are given in eqs. (2.16), (2.18), (2.19), and
(2.20). note that the last three equations can be simplied through the introduction of the
renormalized mass

m 2 = m2  3gg2(0)  3gg2
1.

thus we obtain the following equations for the two-point function,

(2 + m 2)g2(x  y)  gg1g3(0, x  y)  gg4(0, 0, x  y) = (x  y),

the three-point function

and the four-point function

 3gg6(0, 0, x  y, x  z, x  w) = 0.

now there are two regimes. if m2 > 0 the only consistent perturbative solution to the
above system of equations is one in which the odd greens functions are exponentially small,
g2n+1  e1/g, and the even and odd greens functions decouple. [this result is analogous
to that in eq. (3.11).] the even greens functions possess the same perturbative expansion
as in the usual 4 theory except for a change of sign of the coupling constant, so again the
sign of the beta function reverses:

(g) = 27(cid:18) g

2(cid:19)2

.

(5.20)

this theory is asymptotically free. furthermore, in the nonperturbative regime it exhibits
parity symmetry breaking, but possesses pt symmetry because g1 is imaginary.
the other regime is even more interesting. if m2 < 0 it is consistent to proceed in analogy
with our treatment of the 3 theory above. we may assume a perturbative solution of the
form gn  gn/21, as we have already seen in eq. (3.13). then we have a purely imaginary
vacuum expectation value of the eld, from eq. (2.16):

g1 = s m2

g

,

(5.21)

while the leading two-point function has the usual form of a propagator:

g2(p) =

1

p2 + m 2 .

here the renormalized mass in leading order is positive:

m 2 = m2  3gg2

1 = 2m2.

the leading three-point function has an evident diagrammatic interpretation:

g3(p, q) = 6gg1

1

1

p2 + m 2

q2 + m 2

1

(p + q)2 + m 2 .

the tree-level four-point function is easily extracted from eq. (5.19):

g4(p, q, r) =

6g

(p2 + m 2)(q2 + m 2)(r2 + m 2)[(p + q + r)2 + m 2]
3m2

3m2

(cid:20)1 +

(p + q)2 + m 2 +

(p + r)2 + m 2 +

(q + r)2 + m 2(cid:21),

(5.25)

being composed of contibutions from primitive four-point and three-point vertices.
now we have perturbative parity symmetry breaking: the scalar eld acquires a vacuum
expectation value comparable to that of the gauge bosons in the standard model, gg1.
further, it appears likely that the theory is asymptotically free, because the sign of the
four-point vertex is reversed. indeed, apart from one-particle-reducible graphs, eq. (5.25)
gives just the usual primitive vertex in the high momentum limit, except for a change in
sign. the theory is renormalizable because, apart from divergences associated with the 2-,
3-, and 4-point functions, no additional divergences occur. this is due to the fact that, for
example, the 5-point function has no primitive vertices, as can be easily seen from the next
in the sequence of schwinger-dyson equations after eq. (5.18). the lowest order diagrams
contributing to g5 are as sketched in fig. 5.

we have shown that the signs of the beta functions for a conventional g3 theory and for a
pt -symmetric ig3 theory in six space-time dimensions are reversed. thus, while the former
theory is asymptotically free, the latter is not. similarly, the beta functions for a conventional
g4 theory and for a pt -symmetric g4 theory in four space-time dimensions are reversed.
thus, while the former theory is not asymptotically free, the latter is. similarly, as we have
already argued in ref. [12], we believe that while conventional quantum electrodynamics is
not asymptotically free, pt -symmetric electrodynamics is asymptotically free and possesses
a nontrivial xed point.

until g2 has a minimum error of 0.34% at n = 8. for n > 53 the error for g1 decreases until
it levels o at 21.3%. for n > 8 the error for g2 increases like n . the large-n behavior of our

table iii.

schwinger-dyson approximations for mn compared with exact values of the energy dier-
ence, en  e0, calculated in ref. [1]. these approximations are based on the truncation of
the rst three schwinger-dyson equations for an ig3 eld theory of the type in eq. (1.4).
notice that m1 is greater than the numerical result in this case, while in table ii, m1 was
less than the numerical answer. this suggests that in one dimension the oscillatory nature of
successive approximations is present once again. moreover, the percent error has decreased
signicantly; the error is 8.50% for m1 calculated using the rst two schwinger-dyson equa-
tions compared with 3.52% calculated using the rst three schwinger-dyson equations.
