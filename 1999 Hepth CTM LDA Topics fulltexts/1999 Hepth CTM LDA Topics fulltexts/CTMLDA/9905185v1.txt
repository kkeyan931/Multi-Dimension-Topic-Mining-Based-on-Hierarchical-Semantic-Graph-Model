abstract

the bare bones of a theory of quantum gravity are exposed. it may have the potential

to solve the cosmological constant problem. less certain is its behavior in the newtonian

limit.

throughout this discussion we work in euclidean four-dimensional space-time. the

motivating example is of a scalar eld (x) for which we want to construct a eld theory

within which

this is achieved by letting

(x)  0

all

x.

(x) = e(x)

with  a local quantum eld. we let the action for the eld  be given as

then if  is correctly selected we can ensure

s = z 2.

d(x)(y)e = de(x)e(y)e = ec(x,y)

here c(x, y) is the two point correlation function of the  eld, and falls o logarithmi-

cally.

analogously we wish to construct a eld theory for g(x) within which the eld

g(x) has the correct signature for all x, i.e. it is positive denite:

this we achieve by writing

g(x)  0 all x,  .

g(x) = (cid:16)ea(x)(cid:17)

with a a real symmetric matrix. (equations (5) and (6) parallel (1) and (2).) we are

led to expect that if the action of a is quadratic with four derivatives, the two point

function of g may have a desired form. with an action given as

sg = z g(cid:16)rr + r2(cid:17)

(7)

the quadratic part of sg, in terms of the a elds, is of this form, containing only

four derivative terms. the gauge xing terms may also be chosen consistent with this

requirement [1]. we then may hope that for a suitable choice of lpha and  the two

2

point function (as computed using only the quadratic terms of the action) may be of

appropriate form. it would be ideal if the values of  and  of the full theory arose as

an infrared xed point of the renormaliza tion group.

we make a number of comments and observations:

(1) the theory is power-counting renormalizable. it is possible that a complete theory

of renormalizability may be carried out as in [1].

(2) the theory formally solves the cosmological constant problem, since it is invariant
under g  cg. we believe this formal invariance can be extended through the
quantization procedure.

(3) the theory is a large coupling theory. this is because  and  chosen to pattern

the two point function, will not be small. the expression we get for the two point

function, as we have discussed it, will be non-pertur bative in a large coupling

theory. this will make calculations dicult and not necessarily reliable. perhaps

we are dealing with the correct theory, but in not the best formalism.

(4) unitarity is as elusive as usual in higher derivative theories. it is perhaps present in

low orders. we do not know how important unitarity is to a theory of gravitation.

(5) the heart of our present considerations is the gaussian approximation to the two

point function:

dea(x)ea(y)e  z da e

2r ac1aea(x)ea(y)

(8)

written in a slightly schematic notation. the integrals are very non-trivial because

of the matrix nature of exponentials:

(cid:16)ea(x)(cid:17)ij

.

(9)

the evaluation of (8) is made possible (though still complicated) using the fourier

transformation of the exponential in eq. (9) in terms of the entries of a:

this expression is from [2], and is written here for a traceless 4  4 matrix. the
integral r d is the integral over the unit sphere in c4, of a vector vi with respect

to the normalized unitary-invariant measure. and w is the hermitian rank one

projection given as

wij = vivj .

(11)

the program we envision is to select  and  so that the gaussian approximation,

eq. (8), yields a nearly reasonable two point function; and to seek the ultimate

two point function, via perturbative corrections. the correct two point func tions

would yield most of the tested properties of general relativity. remembering that

we are working with a large coupling theory, we expect it to be dicult to get

accurate predictions, to prove or disprove the theory. this is a property we share

with string theory.

(6) we do not know what gauge condition will prove best to study the present theory.

we have considered the condition

a = 0

x

(12)

as being one possibility. for this gauge condition we have found a generalized brs

invariance [3], (more general than the generalized brs transformations studied in

[4]). of course for the usual harmonic gauge condition, the same brs transforma-

tion as u sed in [1] is expected to apply to the current model.

(7) there has been some research on the cosmological implications of actions as in eq.

(7), [5]. for us the pressure is to nd consistency with the newtonian limit and

the tests of general relativity.

(8) as a nal subjective point we nd many aspects of the present theory (so far studied

only fragmentally) to be aesthetic.
