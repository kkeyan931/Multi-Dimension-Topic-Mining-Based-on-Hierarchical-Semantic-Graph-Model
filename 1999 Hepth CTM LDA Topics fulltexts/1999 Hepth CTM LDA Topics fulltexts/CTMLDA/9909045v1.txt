neutral fermions of spin 1

2 with magnetic moment can interact with

electromagnetic elds through nonminimal coupling. in 2+1 dimensions

the electromagnetic eld strength plays the same role to the magnetic mo-

ment as the vector potential to the electric charge. this duality enables

one to obtain physical results for neutral particles from known ones for

charged particles. we give the probability of neutral particle-antiparticle

pair creation in the vacuum by non-uniform electromagnetic elds pro-

duced by constant uniform charge and current densities.

pair creation of charged particles in the vacuum by an external electric eld was rst
studied by schwinger several decades ago [1]. related problems have been discussed by many
authors, for example, in refs. [2-6]. pure magnetic elds do not lead to pair creation. however,
inclusion of a magnetic eld changes the result for a pure electric eld. this has been studied
by several authors [7-11]. the probability of pair creation in the vacuum was also calculated
in lower dimensions [11] and in more general dimensions [8]. similar subjects are now widely
discussed in string and black hole theory.

in this paper we extend the subject to neutral particles of spin 1

2 . neutral particles with
magnetic moment can interact with electromagnetic elds through nonminimal coupling. the
aharonov-casher eect [12] is a well known indication for this interaction, and has been
observed in experiment [13]. so we expect that neutral particle-antiparticle pairs may be
created in the vacuum by external electromagnetic elds.
in 2+1 dimensions this can be
veried by explicit calculations. for certain electromagnetic elds the probability of pair
creation can be calculated exactly. indeed, the result can be obtained from that for charged
particles by using the duality between charged and neutral particles, respectively in external
vector potentials and electromagnetic elds. unfortunately, the problem is rather complicated
in 3+1 dimensions, and useful results are still not available.

consider a neutral fermion of spin 1

2 with mass m and magnetic moment m, moving in an

external electromagnetic eld. the equation of motion for the fermion eld  is [14]

(i    m  f/2  m) = 0,

(1)

where    = ,   f = f, f is the eld strength of the external electromagnetic
eld, and

[, ].

in the following we work in 2+1 dimensions. the dirac matrices  satisfy the relation

 = g  i,

(2)

(3)

where g = diag(1, 1, 1),  is totally antisymmetric in its indices and 012 = 1. the
minus sign in (3) corresponds to representations equivalent to the one

 0 = 3,

 1 = i1,

 2 = i2,

and the plus sign corresponds to representations equivalent to the one

 0 = 3,

 1 = i1,

 2 = i2,

(4a)

(4b)

which is inequivalent to (4a). the dierence between the two cases would not aect physical
results. so we will work with the rst case [with the minus sign in (3)]. the relation (3) is
of crucial importance for the following discussion. note that in other space-time dimensions
there is no similar relation. using (3) we have  = . we dene

then (1) becomes

  f/2 =   f.

[  (i  mf )  m] = 0.

compared with the equation of a charged fermion with spin 1
external electromagnetic vector potential a
q

2 and charge q moving in an

[  (i  qaq)  mq]q = 0

(8)

where a subscript q is used to indicate the charged particle, one easily realize that f  plays the
same role to the neutral particle as a
q to the charged one. this duality has been noticed in the
study of the aharonov-casher eect [12,13]. consequently, constant uniform elds f have
no physical eect on neutral particles. to create particle-antiparticle pairs in the vacuum,
non-uniform elds are necessary. because of the above duality, we call f  the dual vecter
potential, and f = f  f the dual eld strength. the dual magnetic eld is

and the dual electric eld is

b = f12 = f 0 =   e,

ex = f01 = f 2 = tey + xb,

ey = f02 = f 1 = tex + yb.

(9a)

(9b)

(9c)

using the maxwell equation f  = j  where j  is the external source producing the eld
f, we have

b = j 0  ,

ex = j 2  jy,

ey = j 1  jx.

(10a)

(10b)

this means that the current (jy, jx) plays the same role to the neutral particles as an electric
eld to the charged ones, and the charge density  plays the same role as a magnetic eld.
we can now use the conclusions and results of [11] without further calculations. consider an
external electric charge density  and an electric current density j, both being constant and
uniform. the eld strength f produced by them is not uniform. if |j| < || there is no pair
creation. when |j| > ||, we have the probability, per unit time and per unit area, of neutral
particle-antiparticle pair creation in the vacuum

w is independent of the space-time position as both  and j are constant and uniform. also
note that the result is lorentz invariant.

in conclusion, neutral particle-antiparticle pairs can be created in the vacuum by external
electromagnetic elds in 2+1 dimensions, if these particles have nonvanishing magnetic mo-
ment. for electromagnetic elds produced by constant uniform sources, the probability of pair
creation in the vacuum can be obtained from similar results for charged particles. the crucial
point is the duality between magnetic moment and electric charge. it is expected that similar
conclusions can be achieved in 3+1 dimensions. unfortunately, in 3+1 dimensions there is no
relation similar to (3), and the duality used here does not exist. consequently, the calcula-
tions in 3+1 dimensions involve considerable mathematical diculties. we cannot work out
an explicit nontrivial result even for a eld conguration similar to that in 2+1 dimensions,
i.e., a eld conguration where bx = by = ez = 0 and everything is independent of z. at
present, we can only calculate the simplest case for a constant uniform electric eld, but the
result turns out to be trivial. for a constant uniform magnetic eld, the calculations can also
be carried out analytically, but the nal result involves divergent integrals which we still do
not know how to regularize. it seems that some other techniques should be developed to deal
with the subject in 3+1 dimensions.
