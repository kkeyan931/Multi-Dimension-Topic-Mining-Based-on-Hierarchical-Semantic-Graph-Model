(2.3) evaluating free energy planar n limit, done {$9301068$} vanishing m, gives dedekind eta function, f = ln(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 2 24 e2i ( ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = n 2i , (2.4) (2.5) g2n = . quite invariant (1.1). however modied free energy f = f + 1 24 1 2 ln(a) (2.6) modular invariant. additional term proportional local counterterm. how- ever clear modication action could account term ln(a). nonetheless term simple, seems pure qcd2 almost self t-dual. 2 3. hooft ux two form moduli seen t-duality, hooft ux m/n behaves like two form modulus string description. several reasons one could guessed correspondance magnetic ux string theory two form. first, m/n periodic continuous (for n ). second, qcd2 0, partition function integral moduli space connections. dimension space invariant sl(2, z) transformations acting doublet (m, n) {$9212149$}. transformations m/n transforms precisely like kahler structure string theory, vanishing area two form modulus. finally using correspondance d-branes yang mills theories one argue appropriate conditions magnetic ux equal ns-ns two-form modulus. consider system parallel d-branes stretched ns5-branes described theory mass gap, pure su (n ) n = 1 yang-mills {$9212149$}{$9212149$}. since parallel d-branes generally give rise u (n ) bundle, let us construct u (n ) bundle u (1) trace degree freedom frozen, masseless u (1) degrees freedom. torus elds periodic u (n ) gauge transformations, u1 u2, u (n ) bundle satisfy u1u2u 1 u 2 = i. (3.1) u may written products u (1) su (n ) pieces, equation becomes eirt 2 f12 e2i n = i, (3.2) f u (1) eld strength. u (1) degree freedom frozen, locally gauge invariant combination f b must vanish. thus one obtains n = zt 2 b. (3.3) note relation obtained nite n. shall argue elsewhere {$9212149$} periodic potential generated b mass gap. case one obtain continuous class theories non-commutative tori {$9212149$}{$9212149$} varying b. established (3.3), one must still show b behaves like two-form modulus qcd-string well iia string. means b imaginary part action qcd string wrapping torus. argued {$9212149$} lifting 3 brane conguration theory, case iia string qcd-string homotopic {$9212149$}. note qcd t-duality exists, t-duality iia theory variety reasons. exist n limit, n becomes continuous parameter. also, d2-brane charge brane costruction qcd, iia t-duality d4-brane charge vanishes. furthermore kahler structure qcd-string dierent iia string string tensions dierent. 4. qcd4 t-duality four dimensional qcd string much less understood two dimensional qcd string. however qualitative properties large n qcd4 2 r2 consistent self t-duality. take time direction lie r2. theory u (1) u (1) translation symmetry torus. theory self t-dual must another u (1) u (1) symmetry corresponding translations dual torus. large gauge transformations torus generate global zn zn symmetry, becomes continuous n . symmetry translation symmetry dual torus, eigenstates symmetry energies proportional 1/rd, rd radius small dual torus. consistent electric connement. eigenstates zn zn transformations carry electric ux , energy proportional r = 1/(2rd), r radius original torus. (we considering case vanishing magnetic ux). magnetic ux non-vanishing, 1 invert area torus. thus would make sense case exchange winding number qcd string, electric ux, qcd momentum. string theory momentum gets exchanged winding number 1 pi = pi bijwj. pi velocity string, wj winding number: x i(t, ) = pit + wi + . . .. + 1, pi wj invariant pi shifted. therefore quantity qcd corresponding pi pi n ij ej, pi usual momentum ei electric ux. term n ijej precisely form cross product electric magnetic uxes thought contribution hooft uxes momentum. 4 5. might t-duality zn zn symmetry spontaneously broken suciently small torus qcd self t-dual. shrinking one cycle torus keeping xed would break zn associated small torus, nite temperature deconnement transition. know happens cycles torus shrunk simultaneously, rule possibility zn spontaneously broken. even may still theory qcd universality class zn zn symmetry never spontaneously broken. recent arguments suggest large n qcd4 described critical string theory dimensional picture, background, whose boundary qcd world volume{$9711002$}{$9802109$}{$9711200$}{$9802150$}{$9803131$}. spontaneous breaking zn zn would require phase transition dimensional target space geometry cycles boundary torus contractible{$9803131$}. perhaps transition exist. 6. qcd4 two dimensions large n qcd 2 r2 self t-dual, pure qcd r4 would dual qcd r2 two adjoint scalars. fact model used approximate dynamics pure qcd 4 dimensions {$9402107$}{$9507060$}{$9711002$}. adjoint scalars model play role transversely polarized gluons. {$9711002$} spectrum two dimensional model computed discrete light cone quantization compared glueball spectrum pure 4-d qcd computed using monte-carlo simulation. degree numerical accuracy allows crude comparison, however spectra qualitatively agreement. perhaps n limit agreement qualitative. however usual models adjoint scalars incomplete since lack zn zn symmetry. careful dimensional reduction would give non-linear sigma model form ssu(n) = n 2d z d2xt r(cid:18)f 2 + 1 r2 (hidh )2 + 1 r4 (cid:19) . (6.1) rs radius cycles torus, hi element su (n ). writing hi = exp(irsx i) taking rs 0 x xed gives usual naive reduced action. note naive reduced action requires mass counterterm x i. terms hi elds, term would look like 1 r2 course zn zn symmetry might spontaneously broken suciently small rs, pi rhi, prohibited zn zn symmetry. 5 case large n limit generate extra dimensions. tree level directions connect vacua related zn symmetry. directions lifted quantum mechanically, supersymmetric version theory, long range uctuations two dimensions would prevent spontaneous symmetry breaking nite n . unfortunately last statement always true large n limit. 7. conclusion shown large n qcd properties consistent existence self t-duality compactied torus. may qcd really self t-dual, qcd-like theory is. acknowledgments thankful antal jevicki, igor klebanov, joao nunez, burt ovrut, sanjaye ramgoolam, washington taylor, edward witten enlightening conversations. 6
