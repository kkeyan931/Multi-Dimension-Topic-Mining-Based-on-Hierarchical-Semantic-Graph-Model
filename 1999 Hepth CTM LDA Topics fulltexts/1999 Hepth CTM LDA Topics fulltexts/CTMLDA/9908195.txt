(19) rst result (i.e. perfect cancellation ir singularity perturbation theory) seems contradict general discussion non-compact formulation 6) surprising since qed2+1 connes. gauge theories above, shown transversely separated charges need connected gauge string order cancel ir divergences. however, apparent contradiction resolved simple observation lattice hamiltonian non-compact qed2+1 coupled external sources is, tech- nically speaking, bunch coupled shifted harmonic oscillators (the hamilto- nian gaussian!). two important consequences: first all, shifted harmonic oscillators, exact ground state energy obtained already 2nd order perturbation theory. therefore, calculated ground state energy (18) exact one. secondly, language fock space operators, eigenstate shifted harmonic oscillator coherent states, i.e. exponentials raising operators. keeping facts mind, everything ts together: coherent states, eigenstates lattice presence external source, accomplish eect exponentials link elds, namely act soliton like operators necessary cancel small q+ divergence instantaneous self-interaction. furthermore, fact dealing shifted harmonic oscillators qed2+1 also guarantees observed cancellation already perturbation theory even though construct coherent states explicitly. however, bad news dicult construct fock space basis 7 furthermore, one cannot containing exponentials gauge elds. solve problem exactly, dicult achieve cancellation ir singularities unless one works basis gauge invariant states, hard non-compact formulation. usual, qcd, situation worse gauge elds carry color-charge. furthermore, one tries maintain gauge invariance ansatz u = exp (iga) leads g2 exp(iga) exp(iga) = aa + higher orders higher order terms make dicult quantize theory. reasons, non-compact formulation lattice abandoned. 1 color-dielectric formulation lattice naively, one might think one possibility introduce u su(n) elds would work linearized general complex matrix elds add po- tential vef f (u) minimum u su(n) (e.g. mexican hat type potential). however, fock expansion (an essential ingredient lf hamiltonian formulation), elds usually expanded around origin (or xed value). expanding around origin makes sense mex- ican hat shaped potential since origin corresponds false vacuum. hand, expanding around point along minimum breaks mani- fest global gauge symmetry. therefore, idea adding (lagrange multiplier) eective self interaction enforce constraint must abandoned well. 7) even qed2+1, exact solution contains exponentials thus leads non- normalizable states. solution dilemma work blocked (smeared, averaged) degrees freedom m, obtained original u su(n) averaging us strings us nite volume, e.g. dening = pav u . advantage procedure smeared ms longer subject strict su(n) constraint. ms contains eective interaction dened integrating us blocked theory still equivalent original theory, provided action (20) exp  = z du xav u! exp  . catch whole procedure vef f (m) dened eq.
