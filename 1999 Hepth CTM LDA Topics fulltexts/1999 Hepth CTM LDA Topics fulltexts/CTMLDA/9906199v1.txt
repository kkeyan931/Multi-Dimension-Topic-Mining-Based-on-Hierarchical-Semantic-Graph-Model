abstract

the well-known physical equivalence drawn from hole theory is applied
in this article. the author suggests to replace, in the part of feynman di-
agram which cannot be xed by experiments, each fermion eld operator,
and hence fermion propagator, by pairs of equivalent fermion eld opera-
tors and propagators. the formulation of this article thus yields additional
terms which reveal characteristic eects that have not been explored pre-
viously; such characteristic eects lead to the appearence of logarithmic
running terms and that nite radiative corrections are directly obtained in
calculations.

1 introduction

ultraviolet divergence is an important problem in qed. investigation on
this problem, to expose more characteristics of the divergence, may be
helpful in the developments of the quantum eld theory [1]. this article is
an attempt on this problem. in this article, we start from the well-known
and well-established physical equivalence drawn from diracs hole theory
[2], which gives also pairs of physically equivalent fermion propagators.
in general, as measurements or observations x only one of a physically
equivalent pair, the physical equivalence from the hole theory thus gives
nothing new, so such discussion is superuous. however, there are cer-
tain parts of feynman diagrams in qed processes in which the fermion
elds or fermion propagators cannot be xed experimentally ( e.g. fermion
propagators in a self energy loop). both of the two equivalent propaga-
tors are equally probable to happen; thus the physical equivalence might
lead to additional term or terms. it will be shown in section 3 that the
new additional terms coming from physical equivalence really reveal new
characteristic physical eects which are closely related with ultraviolet di-
vergences and can yield nite radiative corrections and hence nite results
in direct calculations of qed processes.

it might be quite interesting to note that one of the striking charac-
teristics of the ultraviolet divergence, i.e. the appearence of, for example,
logarithmic running of qed coupling constant with scale, which has been
veried in precise electroweak measurements, is also given by the formu-
lation of this article, as will be shown in sec. 3; the logarithmic running
terms really appear in this article; however, there are, meanwhile, really
more such logarithmic running terms with dierent charges. such loga-
rithmic terms will combine to give nite radiative corrections.

as the rst paper of this work, main focus is given to the fundamental
assumption and formulation, together with their foundations. here as illus-
tration, one qed process, the vertex, is calculated; other qed processes

3

will be given in subsequent papers.

2 fundamental assumption and the foun-

dation of the formulation

2.1 preliminary discussions on hole theory

in order to propose the fundamental assumption, we need rst to investi-
gate the hole theory [2]. before the investigation on hole theory, we review
rst the characterisitics of tensors formed by fermion and boson eld op-
erators under the transformation x  x, given by refs. [4] and [5]; their
relevant results are rearranged in the form:

(1a),(1b) can be obtained from relevant results in refs. [4], [5]: consider for example
the case of boson elds u which can be divided into two classes u + and u ; from the
paper of pauli, the fundamental homogeneous linear equation of the elds, which should
be in the typical form by the requirement of invariance against proper lorentz group,
as

there are altogether two possible substitutions keeping eq. (1p) invariant:

x ku + =x u , x ku  =x u +

kl  kl(kl = i


xl

, l = 1, 2, 3, 4.), u +  u +, u   u .

(1p)

(2p)

(as u  belong to same class as u ; for simplicity, we use u to represent both u and u 
here and below. ) and

ki  ki, u +  u +, u   u 

(2p)

as the propagation vector ki belongs to u  class, so only (2p) among the two sub-
stitutions (2p), (2p) is consistent; which may also be considered as: when ki  ki,
if eq. (1p) is required to remain invariant, then u +  u +, u   u ; and hence
t  t , s  s. as the invariance of eld equation (1p) is a fundamental requirement,
so we may always write: if x  x, then t  t , s  s. which is (1b). similarly
for (1a).

4

under the transformation x  x:

f ermions f ields : t  t, s  s.

bosons f ields : t  t, s  s.

(1a)

(1b)

t , s in (1a), ( in (1b)) are tensors formed by fermion (boson) eld opera-
tors. t represents tensors of even rank, including scalars, skew symmetric
and symmetric tensors of second rank such as energy momentum tensor,
etc. s represents tensors of odd rank, including vectors such as the charge
current density vector, etc.

now, as a preliminary to the fundamental assumption, we discuss the

physical equivalences drawn from hole theory.

we begin our discussion by reexpressing the well known equivalences

drawn from the hole theory:

b~p,r=3,4  d~p,r=1,2;
b~p,r=1,2  d~p,r=3,4;

b~p,r=3,4  d~p,r=1,2;
b~p,r=1,2  d~p,r=3,4

(2)

the equivalences may also be written as

x~p,r=3,4

b~p,ru(r)(~p) = x~p,r=1,2

dp,rv(r)(~p)

etc. here b (d) refer to e (+e) fermions,  denotes physical equivalence,
the both sides of which express the same physical entity or process.

now we combine the equivalences (2) with (1a). as from (1a) that for
fermions, p(~p, e) reverses its sign on reversing x(~x, t), it is reasonable to
associate p(~p, e) with x(~x, t), (and hence p(~p,e) with x(~x,t))
fermion elds here mean free fermion elds; non-free elds may include a boson
term, e.g. p + e/c a. the fermion eld p and the boson eld term a obeys (1a) and
(1b) respectively.

5

to agree with experimental facts. we obtain immediately a time depen-
dent expression of the equivalences drawn from hole theory. the example

b~p,r=3,4  d~p,r=1,2 is now expressed as the equivalence between the pro-

cesses (a) (b) in fig. 1; namely, there are two equivalent processes: (a)
an electron with charge e, momentum ~p, energy e propagating in t
sense, denoted here and here after as (e,~p,e,t), is annihilated at
x(~x,t). ( x(~x,t) is just the space-time point x(~x, t) viewed in the
frame x.) (b) an electron with (+e, ~p, e, t) is created at x(~x, t). (a) and
(b) are two expressions of a same physical process. all other equivalences
in (2) can be reexpressed similarly.

the equivalences drawn from hole theory also lead directly to pairs of
equivalent electron propagators as depicted in fig. 2, provided the equiv-
alences hold at both x1 and x2. thus there are two physically equivalent
propagators in fig. 2: fig. 2 (a) is an electron with e, ~p, e, propagating
from x1 to x2 in +t sense, denoted as (e, ~p, e, t); while fig. 2 (b) is an
electron with +e,~p,e propagating from x2 = x2 to x1 = x1, in t
sense., denoted as (+e,~p,e,t). mathematical forms of fig. 2 (a), (b)
will be given below.

there are thus equivalences between (e, ~p, e, t) and (+e,~p,e,t)
processes. relations between the equivalent fermion pairs (a), (b). both
of fig. 1 and of fig. 2 are: (a)(b) and (b)(a) will occur under the
simultaneous reections (x  x) and (q  q). note that p  p
is just a consequence of x  x by (1a); and (q  q) is a consequence
of transpose, which interchanges the initial and nal states (see below,
2.2.1) and 2)).

the pair (a),(b) of fig. 2, for example, may be considered as one
fermion propagator, which is (a) or (~p, e; ~x, t), if it is regarded as e
propagator; while it is (b) or (~p,e;~x,t), if it is regarded as +e
propagator. thus it follows that the axes of reference frames of physical
equivalent e and +e fermion elds (particle and antiparticle) are opposite

in sense.

2.2 physically equivalent pairs of fermion eld op-

erators

1) the denition

the well known equivalences drawn from diracs hole theory can be
formulated or generalized as:  to each fermion eld operator (x) there
is a r(x), which is physically equivalent to (x), dened as

r(x) = r(x)r1 = t (x)

(3)

where r = r tr, r being the reection (x  x) operator, which bring (x)
into (x) = o(x), o being a matrix, tr being the transpose operator,
which bring (x) into t (x), with the initial and nal states interchanged.

2) several notes:
i) the operator o given here is a matrix, which is proved, under the
requirement of invariance of dirac equation, etc, as o = 5. ( = 1,i)
[5]. thus,

r(x) = 5t (x)

(3a)

which shows that the transformation of r is just the same as that of joint
operation cp t .
ii) eq. (3a) shows that the charge of r(x) should be q if that of (x)
is q, since they are connected by the transformation cp t . eq. (3) gives
directly that r(x) is the fermion proceeding in the sense of time t, if
(x) is that proceeding in the sense of time +t; the opposite sense of time
gives the interchange of creation and annihilation operators. thus, e.g.,
the creation of e charge of (x) is turned into annihilation of e, or
creation of +e charge of r(x); therefore r(x) and (x) are opposite in
charge. this is just the physical equivalence drawn from hole theory.

9

the transformation (3) or (3a) is called strong reection by pauli

[3] (see also [5]).
iii) thus, if we take (x) as a q = e fermion with +p(+e) proceeding in
the sense of +t, i.e., e,p,+e,+t, r(x) will then be r
+e,p,e,t (see also
eq. (1a)). the physical equivalence between e,p,+e,+t and r
+e,p,e,t
is just the equivalences in eq. (2) (e.g. b~p,r=1,2  d~p,r=3,4 etc., b, d being
operators of e, +e respectively, remember that the transpose makes r
to proceed in the sense t.).
iv) the fact that e,t fermions are closely related to the +e, +t fermions
with opposite charge was already given by feynman [6]. however, the prob-
lem is treated here in a somewhat dierent point of view; in this article, all
processes of fermion eld operators and of products of them always proceed
in the order of increasing time in its own frame of reference (namely the
frame that the t-axis is directed in +t (t) sense for the fermion +t (t)
); t arises only when a process is viewed in other frame of reference. this
explains also why a particle travelling from x1 to x2 is the same as an
antiparticle travelling from x2 to x1. (see also fig.2).

the transpose operation in (3) and (3a) keeps that all processes proceed

in the order of increasing of time.
3) it is signicant to note that it has been proved that the transformation
of r (eq. (3)) leaves both eld equations and commutation relations in-
variant [7]. also it has been proved that, if the electromagnetic elds a
is transformed by r simultaneously, i.e.,

ar

 (x) = ra(x)r1 = at

 (x)

(3)

the transformation of r leaves both eld equations and commutation re-
lations of fermion and boson elds invariant. moreover, the fundamental
equations of quantum electrodynamics are invariant under the transforma-
tion of r [7].

therefore the transformation of r is consistently dened for full inter-

acting quantum eld theory.

10

2.3 the fundamental assumption

1) before proposing the fundamental assumption, it might be signicant
to notice that qed processes consist of two possible cases (or parts of
feynman diagram): (a). observable case (or parts), which can be directly
observed or determined by measurements, (e.g. external fermion or boson
lines). (b). unobservable case (or parts), which cannot be directly deter-
mined by measurements or observations (e.g. fermion propagators in the
loops of self energy processes).

in case (a), the observable case, although there are equivalent expres-
sions  and r, a fermion eld or a physical process is always uniquely
expressed by only one expression xed by measurement (e.g. , if it is
expressed with +e, +t which agrees with measurement condition). every-
thing is as usual, nothing new can be given by the physical equivalence
dened in eq. (3).

in case (b), the unobservable case, a fermion eld operator or physi-
cal process cannot be determined by measurements or observations. no
measurement can determine which expression should be taken. the two
equivalent expressions, e.g.  and r, are then equally probable.

it should be noted that: the case (a) is the ordinary case, in which
each c, p , t reection can be operated separately; while in case (b),
although the transformation r satises cp t theorem, single reections
p , t , c cannot be performed separately in general, since no observation
or measurement can be performed in case (b); hence a single reection,
e.g., t , cannot be dened. only case (a) has been considered nowadays;
while case (b) has never been investigated so far (case (b) appears only in
some intermediate steps.).

in case (b), the physically equivalent fermion eld (x) and r(x),
interaction and
which satify the same quantum eld equation with e.m.
commutation relation, are observed under dierent conditions (e.g. (x)
is measured or viewed in the frame of reference +x(+~x, +t), q = e; while

11

r(x) is viewed in the frame x(~x,t), q = +e). in each measurement,
we can only measure either (x) or r(x), but not both; so it is suitable
to apply, as in quantum mechanics, the superposition principle. as no
measurement can determine which of  and r is more probable than the
other; so  and r should appear with equal probability; we arrive thus
naturally at the fundamental assumption.
2) fundamental assumption:

in the unobservable case (case (b)), a fermion eld operator, which is

(x) in the observable case (case (a)), is expressed as

1

2 h(x) + r(x)i

(4)

where r(x) = r(x)r1 is dened in eq. (3) and the statements in that
paragraph. this is the fundamental assumption of this article.

it should be noted that, in the case (a), r(x) is automatically turned
into (x) which is expressed in the frame of reference +x(+~x, +t). this is
due to that (x), r(x) are just two expressions of the same e fermion
eld viewed from frame of reference +x(+~x, +t), q = e and x(~x,t),
q = +e, respectively; in other words, r(x) is just (x) viewed in the
frame x(~x,t), q = +e. the case (a) is, e.g., to observe r(x), which
should be transformed to the frame +x(~x, t), i.e. into (x), as

rr(x)r1 |oi = (x) |oi

(5)

|oi is the observable state which is xed in the frame +x(+~x, +t).

the transformation (5) between two expressions of the same eld leaves
the fermion eld unchanged. transformation (5) is just twice operation of
transformation r on (x).

as (x) and r(x) in expression (4) should be measured in two dier-
ent measurements, if we pass from case (b) to case (a), the norm becomes,
by (5) and (4), 1
operator is well connected between unobservable and observable parts of

2 h|(x)|2 + |r(x)|2i = |(x)|2. thus, each fermion eld

12

a feynman diagram; this guarantees the conservation of fermion number
and everything of fermion elds.

in the case (b), as (x) and r(x) are equally probable, the complete
set of fermion eld operators should be extended to that given by (a1)
and (a1) in appendix a.

2.4 the s-matrix formulation

the formulation of this article is the same as the s-matrix formulation of
conventional qed, i.e.

s(n)

s = xn
(i)n
n!
t [h i(xn)h i(xn1)    h i(x1)]

d4xnz 

d4xn1   z 

z 







s(n) =

d4x1

(6)

except only that in the unobservable case (case (b)), (x) in each h i(x) =

ie(x)(x)a(x) is replaced by 12 h(x) + r(x)i given in (4). a(x)

multiplied with r(x) is correspondingly transformed by r, ((3)), since 
interacts with a at same space-time points (while in case (a) nothing is
changed).

in (6), h i(x) denote interaction hamiltonian densities. the chrono-
logical operator t is dened as usual. ( i.e. all factors in the bracket after
t are arranged so that the time of the factors are increasing from right
to left; a factor p is multiplied where p is the number of permutations of
fermion eld operators to bring them into chronological order).

r

in case (b), due to the replacement of (x) by 12 h(x) + r(x)i,

each h i(x) in eq. (6) is then replaced by, 1
ie
2 h(x)(x)a(x) + r(x)r(x)ai on
replacing (x) by 12 h(x) + r(x)i; all other terms that might appear in

2 hh i(x) + h r

actually h i(x) becomes ie

i (x)i, h r

(x)r(x)ar

i (x) =

 (x).

13

the direct replacement are excluded by the requirement that every term in
h i(x) should be an electromagnetic interaction term which is a product of
various elds at the same space-time point. therefore, in case (b), h i(x)
is replaced by 1
(a), as each r(x) is automatically turned into (x), 1
is turned into h i(x) automatically.

i (x)i. also, if we pass from case (b) to case
i (x)i
i (x)i is arranged by the chronological

operator t into two products ( the product of h i(x) and h r
i (x)). it may
be interesting to note that the order of factors in the product of h i(x) is
automatically reversed.

2 hh i(x) + h r

2 hh i(x) + h r

the product of 1

2 hh i(x) + h r

2.5 summarization of the formulation of this article

i). the formulation of this article diers from conventional qed only in
one point, namely:
in the unobservable case, (or parts of a feynman
diagram; the case (b)), each fermion eld operator (x) is replaced by

12 h(x) + r(x)i, (the fundamental assumption).

everything except this point is the same as conventional qed and hence

need not be qualied or discussed.

ii). the critical point of the replacement stated in i) is the transfor-

mation of r drawn from hole theory ((3) and (3)).

1).

it has been proved that the fundamental equations of quantum
electrodynamics are invariant under the transformation r [7]. therefore
the transformation of r of this article leaves the fundamental equations
of qed invariant, and hence is consistently dened for full interacting
quantum eld theory.

2). causality is satised, which can be seen directly by the chronological
operator t in (6). also, all processes dened above proceed in the sense
of increasing time; t arises only when a process is viewed in other frame
of reference. furthermore, if only observable states dened above, such as
(x), are considered, there appears only +t.

14

3) unitarity is satised.
i) the transformation r dened in this article is itself unitary. actually,
the transformation r satises cp t theorem. therefore the formulation
of this article satises unitarity.

ii) the fermion(s) (and fermion propagator(s)) in each s(n) in (6) are
the same as in s(n) of the corresponding conventional s-matrix theory,

in the observable case (case(b)).

throughout each process except that (x) is replaced by 12 h(x) + r(x)i
a) in the expression 12 h(x) + r(x)i the sum of probabilities of (x)

and r(x) , which cannot be measured simultaneously, is equal to unity.
b) the two expressions (x) and r(x) of the same fermion eld
in eq. (4) can only be measured in two dierent measurements; so if
we pass from case (b) to case (a), r(x) should be transformed into
(x), as given by eq. (5). so the norm of
1

12 h(x) + r(x)i is then
2 h|(x)|2 + |r(x)|2i = |(x)|2 which is just that of (x) in the case (a).

therefore, each fermion eld operator is well connected between unobserv-
able and observable parts of a feynman diagram. this guarrantees the
unitarity and conservation of quantum number and everything of fermion
elds.

4) the transformation r is also called strong reection by pauli [3]
(see also [5]), which satises cp t theorem. however, it should be noted
that separate p , t ,... reections, which is dened only in observable case
(case (a)), is not dened in the unopbservable case (case (b)).

3 consequences

the fundamental assumption and the formulation given in sec. 2 lead
directly to the following consequences:
1. two equivalent pairs of fermion propagators.

we have already given in sec. 2 that the occurrence of two physically

15

equivalent expressions of each fermion eld operator leads to the occurrence
of:

(1) two equivalent expressions of each fermion propagator. this is a
direct consequence of the physical equivalence drawn from hole theory, as
shown in fig. 2. there are in general two equivalent propagators for each
fermion propagator in feynman diagram. in the case when a propagator
can be determined by measurement (the observable case (a)), the two
equivalent propagators will automatically become identical.

(2) two equivalent pairs of fermion propagators.
if we include the unobservable case (b), the appearence of pairs of phys-
ically equivalent fermion eld operators extends the complete set of fermion
eld operators to (a1), (a1) given in appendix a. such extended complete
set of fermion eld operators can constitute four fermion propagators, i.e.
two equivalent pairs of fermion propagators. namely, the propagator(a)
formed by (a1a),(a1a) and its equivalent (b) by (a1b),(a1b); and sim-
ilarly (c) and (d) formed respectively by (a1c),(a1c) and (a1d),(a1d),
as given in appendix a. the results of appendix a, the propagators
(a),(b),(c),(d), are written here:

2. occurrence of characteristic eects in the calculations of typical diver-
gence problems in qed.

from the statement in 1, in the unobservable case (b), the formulation
eq. (6) gives directly, for each fermion propagator in the feynman diagram
of a qed process:

16

(1) a sum of two propagators of an equivalent pair each multiplied with

its interacting e.m. eld operator.

(2) two equivalent pairs of fermion propagators (a), (b) and (c), (d),

each pair occurs with equal probability.

(1) and (2) give two signicant characteristic eects which will be dis-
cussed in and after the illustrative examples of qed process given below.
in order to illustrate the fundamental assumption and the formulation of
the article, typical divergence processes have been calculated. as the cal-
culations are somewhat lengthy, we choose only one of them, the vertex,
here to show the ability of the formulation of this article; other processes
will be given in subsequent papers.
the vertex [8]

the s-matrix element of the vertex of an electron incoming at x1 with
(e, ~p1, e1) outgoing at x2 with (e, ~p2, e2) and interacting with the ex-
eiqx3 at x3, is hf| s(3) |ii. the s(3) in eq. (6) has
ternal eld ae
been rewritten, in appendix b.,1., as

(x3) = ae

((x3)(x1) a(x1)(x1) + r(x3)
the terms which are zero in the matrix element hf| s(3) |ii have not
been written, where |ii = b+
3! is omitted
since only one of the 3! possible gures is taken. the space-time variables
in (7) are only x2, x3, x1; x3, x1 in (7) are just x3, x1, the sign is + or
 according to the fermion propagators taken (see appendix a.2).

(x) in (7) is equally well be multiplied to the

the external eld ae

second square bracket; namely written as ae

(x3) instead of ae

(x3).

as pairs of fermion propagators in the two square brackets in (7) should
be taken over all possible pairs, (a),(b) and (c),(d), there are thus four
cases:

17

i) . (a),(b) in both square brackets.
ii). (a),(b) in the rst, (c),(d) in the second square bracket .
iii). (c),(d) in the rst,(a),(b) in the second square bracket.
iv). (c),(d) in both square brackets.

as it can be easily shown that (iii), (iv) give the same value as (i),
(ii); so it is only necessary to calculate (i), (ii) with the result times 2. so
eq. (7) can be written as

s(3) =

in the rst term of (8), which is the integral of i, (81a) or (81b), in
which the propagators in both square brackets are all (a), (b); so x3 = x3.
hence (81a) = (81b) as required.

while the second term of (8), which is the integral of (ii), (82a) or
(82b), in which the propagators in the rst square bracket are (a), (b);
while those in the second square bracket are (c), (d). so x3 = x3 (see
appendix a). however, it is required that (82a) has to be equal to (82b)
for all values of x3; namely it is required that ae
(x3), i.e., it is
required that eiqx3 = eiqx3; as x3 runs over all space-time points, so it is
required q = 0.

(x3) = ae

actually, q = 0 is a signicant physical condition; since as boson elds behaves
dierently from fermion elds under the reection x  x as given by (1a), (1b), the
factor eipx of a fermion propagator with p = p  e/c a is unchanged under x  x if
a = 0 is assumed, since ei(b)(x) = eipx by (1a).

the two terms in the square bracket of (8) means that we should take

we see at once that there are logarithmic running terms in both c-
titious processes (hf| s(3) |ii )i and (hf| s(3) |ii )ii (due to the  k2
2 terms
in the numerators of both integrands.). this shows why the conventional

20

formulation of qed, which includes (hf| s(3) |ii )i only, gives logarithmic
running terms. while in the formulation of this article, althrough there
appear also logarithmic terms, the  k2
2 terms in the numerators of (a4i),
and (a4ii) conceled each other before integration over d4k; thus there is
no divergence in all processes of this article; the nite radiative corrections
are obtained directly.

we see that the rst pair of propagators in {i} and {ii} are the
same, they dier only in the second pair, (a), (b) in {i}, while (c),
(d) in {ii}. as (a),(b) and (c),(d) are propagators (e, ~p, e, ~x, t),
(+e,~p,e,~x,t) and (e,~p,e,~x,t), (+e, ~p, e, ~x, t) respectively,
so, e.g., the propagators (~p, e, ~x, t) in (a),(b) and in (c),(d) are respec-
tively (a) and (d) which are opposite in charge. similarly, the two propa-
gators (~p,e,~x,t) are also opposite in charge. so the charge content
of the pair (a),(b) is dierent from that of (c),(d).

therefore the terms {i} and {ii} in (8) are really coexisting physical
processes with dierent charges. so it is not surprising that we can measure
logarithmic running of , e.g., coupling constant , while the two coexisting
processes {i} and {ii} have the eect of concellation with each other at
very large k or very small distance (see the  k2
2 terms in the numerators
of (a4i) and (a4ii)) which renders the nal results nite.

so far we have discussed, in the process of the vertex, the characteris-
tic eect coming from the averaging of coexisting {i} and {ii} processes.
there is another characteristic eect coming from replacing a fermion prop-
agator interacting with e.m. (photon) eld by two propagators of an equiv-
alent pair each multiplied with its interacting e.m. eld operator. this
eect will cancel the logarithmic divergence in the self energy of free elec-
trons; while for non-free electrons, we obtain, on combining this eect with
the averaging of coexisting processes {i} and {ii} discussed above, nite
radiative corrections. these will be given by the processes in subsequent
papers.

4 conclusion and discussions

1. based on the fundamental assumption, (x) is replaced by

1

2 h(x) + r(x)i

in case (b), the formulation of this article leads, in the case (b), to that:

1) every propagator in feynman diagram is replaced by two propaga-
tors of an equivalent pair, each multiplied with its interacting e.m. eld
operator.

2) there occur two pairs of fermion propagators, (a), (b) and (c), (d),

each with equal probability.

each of 1), 2) gives a characteristic eect which is closely related to

the ultraviolet divergence.

2. as given above, we have obtained, on one hand, the appearence
of logarithmic running terms; while on the other, the nite results of cal-
culations. this is due to that, there appear, in this article, logarithmic
running terms with dierent charges ( see the statements near the end of
sec. 3), so the cancellation of logarithmic terms at very large values of k,
or very small distance, is a very natural physical eect. the cancellation
of logarithmic terms takes place before the nal integration over k; so no
ultraviolet divergences appear nally in our calculations; nite radiative
corrections are obtained in direct calculations. it might be possible that,
according to the author, the appearence of ultraviolet divergence might be
due to the negligence of the case (b).

3. since the calculations of each process are somewhat lengthy, only
one of them can be given here, actually the author have calculated the
three typical divergence problems, i.e., the self energy of electron, the self
energy of photon (vavuum polarization), and the vertex. preliminary re-
sults show that all the radiative corrections are the same as those obtained
in conventional renormalization treatments. such works will be given in
subsequent papers.

22

the three typical divergences are the source of all ultraviolet diver-
gences in qed; so it might be expected that in the treatment of this
article, the results of all higher order diagrams may be all the same as
those given by the conventional renormalization treatment. however, such
works, which are somewhat lengthy, can only be given in a series of sub-
sequent papers.

2. fermion propagators.

there can be formed, from the complete set of fermion eld operators,
(a1) and (a1), two equivalent pairs of fermion propagators, i.e. the prop-
agators formed by (a1a), (a1a) and by (a1c),(a1c) together with their
respective equivalents formed by (a1b), (a1b) and by (a1d), (a1d). now
we derive the mathematical forms of the four fermion propagators:

we derive rst the mathematical form of the fermion propagator formed
by (a1a),(a1a) and its equivalent ( by (a1b),(a1b)), i.e. fig. 2 (a) and
(b). the propagator (a), the electron propagator with (e, ~p, e, t) has al-
ready been given in the usual way as the matrix element of t (cid:16)(x2)(x1)(cid:17)
between vacuum states, where (x) = pp,r=1,2 bp,ru(r)(~p) exp(ipx), (x02 >

x01), as

0 h| t (cid:16)(x2)(x1)(cid:17)|i0 =

(2)3 z d3pip + m

2e

eip(x2x1)

(a2a)

(a2a) is the propagator (e, ~p, e, ~x, t) in its own frame of reference,
called the frame of e; it is also the propagator (+e, ~p, e, ~x, t) in the frame
of +e, since (a2a) is independent of sign of q. to obtain the propagator

24

(b) of fig. 2, we may write rst the propagator (+e,~p,e,~x,t) in
the frame of +e by operating r (x  x on (a2a), as

0 h| t (cid:16)r(x2)

(a2b)

mathematical forms of an equivalent pair of propagators ( i.e. an equiv-
alent pair of expressions of one propagator) should be written in same
frame of reference since they have to be calculated together. so we have
to write the propagator (b) as (+e,~p,e,~x,t) in the same frame as
(a), i.e.
in the frame of e. as the axes of frames of reference of physi-
cally equivalent e and +e fermion elds are opposite in sense, as stated
at the end of sec. 2.1, we have only to replace x in (a2b) by x, and
hence p by p according to (1a), which leads to the required propagator
(+e,p,e,x,t) in the frame of e, as

0 h| t (cid:16)r(x2)r(x1)(cid:17) |i0 = 

1

(2)3 z d3pip + m

2e

eip(x2x1)

(a2b)

note that for a fermion eld operator, e.g., the equivalence eld r(x)
of (x) is just (x) when viewed from e frame (+x, +t); however, the
equivalent propagator (a2b) is not exactly (a2a) when viewed in the frame
of e; but dier in a minus sign. this is due to that a propagator consists
if the
of two operators, one production and one annihilation operator.
frame of reference is changed, the order of the two operators should also be
changed, and hence a minus sign is brought in. (notice that there are now
two operations, the transpose operation and the operation of chronological
operator t .) the pair of equivalent propagators (a2a), (a2b) should,
as in usual eld theory, be written in four dimensional form, denoted as
(a),(b),

25

eip(x2x1)

(a)

i

(2)4 z d4p

ip  m
p2 + m2

eip(x2x1)

(b)

we proceed next to propagator formed by (a1c),(a1c) and its equiva-
lent ( by (a1d),(a1d)). this equivalent pair of fermion propagators, called
(c),(d), can be more quickly obtained from (a),(b) through x  x
as:

p2 + m2

(2)4 z d4pip  m
(2)4 z d4p

ip + m
p2 + m2

i

eip(x2x1)

eip(x2x1)

each of (a),(b),(c),(d) includes, in the usual way, two three dimen-
sional propagators; e.g. (a) includes: (e, ~p, e) for x02 > x01, and (+e, ~p, e)
for x01 > x02. similarly for (b),(c),(d). the space-time variable of prop-
agator (a2a) is chosen as x, which is also that of (a). in this way the
space-time variables of (a),(b),(c),(d) are x, x, x, x respectively .

(c),(d) should be considered as independent propagators, although
they could be obtained from (a),(b) through (x  x), since we are
not permitted to make the transformation (x  x), e.g., on (a) alone,
which is only a part of feynman diagram of a whole qed process. there
are altogether two equivalent pairs of propagators (a),(b) and (c),(d).
the four propagators (a),(b),(c),(d) given here are all written in the
frame of e.

are applied, it can be seen that the twice minus sign cancelled out, leaving
aer

(x).)

we have written the space-time variable as in the rst square bracket
in (8), while as x in the second. this is due to that the pair of propagator
in each square bracket may be either taken as (a),(b) or as (c),(d). for
example, if (a),(b) are in both square brackets (case i)), x = x; if (a),(b)
in the rst while (c),(d) in the second ( case ii)) x = x.

start now from (8). we need only to calculate the rst terms in each

can be obtained from (8)a through k  k. it is readily proved that the

(8) is twice that of (8)a.

similarly, those in the second curly bracket are respectively {2m2
