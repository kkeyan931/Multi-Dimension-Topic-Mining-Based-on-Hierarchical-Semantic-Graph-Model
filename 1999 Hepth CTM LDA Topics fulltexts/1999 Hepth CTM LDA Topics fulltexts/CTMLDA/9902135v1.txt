abstract

a charged superconductiong cosmic string produces an extremely large

electric eld in its vicinity. this leads to vacuum instability and to the for-

mation of a charged vacuum condensate which screens the electric charge of

the string. we analyze the structure of this condensate using the thomas-

fermi method.

i. introduction

cosmic strings are linear defects that could be formed at a phase transition in the early

universe. (for a review see [1].) witten [2] has shown that strings predicted in some grand

unied models behave as superconducting wires. such strings moving through magnetized

cosmic plasmas can develop large currents and can give rise to a variety of astrophysical

eects.

in particular, they have been suggested as possible sources of ultrahigh energy

cosmic rays [3].

currents developed by oscillating strings in a magnetic eld are not homogeneous along

the strings because dierent portions of the string cross the magnetic eld lines in dierent

directions. this results in charge accumulation, and portions of the string can develop a

charge per unit length  comparable to the current,   j. (here and below we use units
in which h = c = 1.) the electric eld near the string is given by

e =

2
r

.

(1)

it can become extremely strong in the immediate vicinity of the string, and then quantum

eects, such as vaccum polarization and pair production, must be taken into account. one

can expect that the created particles of charge opposite to that of the string will accumulate

in bound states and form a condensate screening the electric eld near the string to below the

critical value. it was noted earlier that such screening would lead to a drastic modication

of string electrodynamics [4] and would have a signicant eect on the propagation of high-

energy particles emitted from the charged portions of the string [5]. the purpose of the

present paper is to give a quantitative description of the screening condensate near a charged

superconducting string.

the superconducting current in the strings is carried by charged particles which acquire a

mass m at the string-forming phase transition but remain massless inside the strings. these

massless charge carriers move along the strings at the speed of light. the string current is

bounded by the critical value,

2

jc  em,

(2)

at which the characteristic energy of the charge carriers becomes comparable to m, so that

they have enough energy to jump out of the string. the mass m is model-dependent but is

limited by the string symmetry breaking scale , m <

 .

in a cosmological setting, the string charges and currents vary on astronomical time and

length scales, and for our purposes we can regard them as constant. for a string segment

with j < , we can always nd a lorentz frame where j = 0. the electric eld close to the

string will then be well approximated by that of an innite straight string. we shall consider,

therefore, an innite straight string with a constant charge per unit length  and vanishing

current, j = 0. for suciently large , charged particles (for deniteness electrons) have

bound states localized near the string with negative energies smaller than m, where m
is the electron mass. the vacuum then becomes unstable with respect to production of

electron-positron pairs. for a positively charged string, positrons are repelled away, while

electrons form a vacuum condensate surrounding the string. we shall determine the electric

eld and the charge distribution in this condensate using the thomas-fermi method [6]

in which the condensate is approximately treated as an ideal gas obeying the fermi-dirac

statistics.

in the next section we shall review the derivation of the relativistic thomas-fermi equa-

tion and specify the boundary conditions appropriate for the case of cylindrical symmetry.

approximate analytic solutions of this equation are given in sec. iii, and its numerical solu-

tions are presented in sec. iv. the conclusions of the paper are summarized and discussed

in sec. v.

ii. thomas-fermi equation

the density of electrons in a degenerate fermi gas is related to the fermi momentum pf

by

3

ne(r) =

p3
f
32 .

the relativistic relation between the fermi energy f and fermi momentum is

pf = h(f  v (r))2  m2i1/2

(3)

(4)

where m is the electron mass, e is its charge, v (r) = e(r) and (r) is the self-consistent
electrostatic potential for an electron, taking into account both the eld of the string and

the average eld produced by other electrons of the condensate. the condensate is formed

of electrons occupying quantum states in the negative energy continuum,  < m. we
therefore set the fermi energy to be f = m. the electron density (3) is then given by

ne(r) =

1

32 hv 2(r) + 2mv (r)i3/2

(5)

introducing the total charge density t which is composed of the electron charge and

external string charge,

and using the poisson equation

t = s  ene

v (r) = 4et (r),

we nd a self-consistent non-linear dierential equation

v (r) = 4e(cid:20) e

32 (cid:16)v 2(r) + 2mv (r)(cid:17)3/2

 s(r)(cid:21) .

(6)

(7)

(8)

this equation has been used in [8,9] to study the electron condensate around supercharged

nuclei. in the case of a string, the problem has cylindrical symmetry and

v (r) = v (r) +

1
r

v (r).

(9)

we shall approximate the string charge distribuition as a uniform distribuition in a

cylinder of radius ,

4

s(r) = 0(  r).

(10)

the linear charge density of the string is given by  = 20. the charge carriers are

typically concentrated in a tube of radius r  m 1; hence, we should have   m 1.

it is easily seen from eq. (5) that the density of electrons, ne(r), is dierent from zero

only in the region of space where v (r) < 2m. therefore, the condensate has a nite radius
r = rc. for r > rc, the solution of (8) is just the usual logarithmic potential of a linear

charge,

v (r) = 2e0 ln

r
r

(11)

here, 0 is the total charge per unit length of string, including both the charge carriers in

the core and the condensate, and r is the cuto radius indicating the distance at which the

approximation of an innite straight string breaks down. r is given by the smallest of the

following three length scales: (i) the typical distance between the strings in a cosmic string

network, (ii) the characteristic curvature radius of string, (iii) the typical wavelength of the

current-charge oscillations along the string.

the boundary condition for eq. (8) at r = 0 is

v (0) = 0,

while at r = rc we have

v (rc) = 2m,

v (rc) =

2

rc ln(r/rc)

.

(12)

(13)

note that we have three rather than two boundary conditions, as a second-order dierential

equation would normally require. the third condition is needed to determine the condensate

radius rc

we expect rc to be microscopic, while r will typically be astrophysically large. hence,
the logarithm in eq.(13) is ln(r/rc)  102. in numerical calculations below we choose r
so that ln(r/rc)  30; our results are not sensitive to this choice.

5

the thomas-fermi approximation is adequate when the characteristic scale of variation

of the condensate density ne(r) is large compared to the electron wavelength 1/p(r). the

corresponding condition is

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

d

p(r)#(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
dr " 1

 1.

(14)

we shall see that this condition is satised in most of the condensate region 0 < r < rc,

provided that the charge density  is suciently large.

iii. analytic approximations

the thomas-fermi equation (8) can be solved analytically in the limit when the mag-

nitude of the potential v (r) is large, |v (r)|  2m. we can then neglect 2mv (r) compared
to v 2(r), and outside the string core eq.(8) reduces to

this has a solution

with

v (r) +

1
r

v (r) = 

4e2
3 |v (r)|3.

v (r) = c/r

c = (3/4e2)1/2  18.

the corresponding electric eld is

e(r) = c/er2.

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

we note that the solutions (16) and (18) do not depend on the string charge density .

as r decreases, the electric eld (18) grows faster than that of the vacuum solution (1). it

cannot, therefore, be extended all the way to the string but has to be matched with eq. (1)

at some radius rs below which the vacuum solution takes over. the matching radius at

which the two electric elds become comparable is

6

rs  c/e  2001.

(19)

we shall call it the screening radius. for r  rs, the screening is unimportant and the
electric eld is given by eq. (1). the screening radius is always large compared to the string

thickness   m 1, provided that  is smaller than the critical value (2),

 <
 em.

the potential corresponding to the vacuum solution (1) at  < r  rs is

v (r) = 2e[ln(rs/r) + b],

where b  1 is a numerical constant. the potential at the string core is thus

v (0)  2e ln(rs/).

(20)

(21)

(22)

the condition |v (r)|  m implies r  c/m, and thus the solution (18) is valid in
the range c/e  r  c/m. this range exists only if  is suciently large,   m/e.
combined with the condition (20) this implies m  m/e2.
in models of astrophysical
interest, the charge carrier mass m is very large (so that the strings can develop large

currents and charges), and this condition is satised with a large margin.

at r  c/m, the potential v (r) becomes comparable to m signalling that we are close
to the condensate boundary [see eq. (13)]. hence, we can estimate the condensate radius as

rc  c/m.

(23)

the condition of validity of the thomas-fermi approximation (14), when applied to the

solution (16), gives c  1. this is satised with a reasonable accuracy [see eq. (17)].

iv. numerical calculation

we obtained numerical solutions to the thomas-fermi equation for eq. (8) for v (r)

with the boundary conditions (12) and (13) using the relaxation method. the resulting

7

electric eld is plotted in fig. 1, together with the analytic approximations (1) and (18).

the agreement between the analytic and numerical solutions is excellent in the appropriate

ranges of the radius r.

we have veried that the shape of v (r) outside the string core is not sensitive to the

value of the core radius . in particular, the condensate radius rc approaches a constant

value independent of  (see fig. 2). this is very fortunate, since a realistic value of the

core radius would be too small to resolve in our calculations. figure 2 suggests that it is

sucient to choose   m1. we used  = 103m1 in most of the calculations described
below.

the condensate radius rc is plotted in fig. 3, as a function of the linear charge density

of the string, . we see that at large , rc approches a constant value,

rc = 82m1,

(24)

in agreement with eq. (23). the screened linear charge density of the string 0, which

determines the electric eld outside rc, is also found to be independent of :

0  5.34em.

the electric eld at the condesate boundary is

e0 = 20/rc  101em2.

(25)

(26)

note that this is considerably smaller than the critical eld, ec = m2/e, which signals the
onset of intensive pair production [10]. in our case, e0  103ec. we shall return to this
point later in sec. v.

the eective linear charge density ef f (r) inside the condensate can be found as

ef f (r) = 2z r

0

(r)rdr =

r
2e

dv
dr

(27)

where we have used eq. (7). as r grows, ef f (r) decreases and we can dene the eective

screening radius rs as the radius at which half of the string charge is screened,

8

ef f (rs) = /2.

(28)

at the boundary of the condensate we must have ef f (rc) = 0. the screening radius rs

is plotted in fig. 4 for several values of . we see that, although the condensate radius rc

is independent of , the screening radius gets smaller rather rapidly as  is increased. a

numerical t to the data in the fig. 4 gives

rs = 801,

(29)

in agreement with the order-of-magnitude estimate (19).

v. summary and discussion

we have found that a superconducting cosmic string having a suciently large charge

per unit length,   m/e, is surrounded by an electron condensate of radius rc  100m1,
in the immediate vicinity of the string, the eect of the
where m is the electron mass.

condensate is unimportant and the electric eld is given by the vacuum solution, e  2/r.
screening due to the condensate becomes signicant at r  rs  1001, and for rs  r 
rc the electric eld has the form e  (3)1/2/2e2r2. outside the condensate, at r > rc, the
eld is given by e  em/r  102em2(rc/r).

as we already mentioned, the electric eld at the condensate boundary is well below the

critical eld, e0  103ec, where ec = m2/e. the rate of pair production per unit volume
in a homogeneous electric eld is [10]

dn/dv dt  (ee/)2 exp(ec/e),

(30)

which indicates that the outer parts of the condensate where e  ec will be lled up very
slowly. the characteristic time of pair production,   (ee)1/2 exp(ec/e), is greater
than the age of the universe for e <
 4  102ec. for astrophysical strings, we expect the

condensate radius to be given by the distance from the string at which such values of the

electric eld are reached. from eq. (16) we nd

9

c
20

rc 

m1  0.2m1.

(31)

as the charge density of the string  is increased, the potential near the string core

becomes more and more negative. as a result, particles more massive than electrons de-

velop condensates. from eq. (22), particles of mass  develop states with  <  at
  /e ln(rs/)  . the condensates of dierent particle species will have the form of
coaxial cylinders, with condensates of more massive particles being closer to the string.

finally, we would like to mention some open questions. in this paper we studied vacuum

condensation of fermions. charged bose particles, such as higgs and gauge bosons will also

form vacuum condensates, and the properties of these bosonic condensates may dier from

the fermionic case. another important problem is the nature of modications introduced

by vacuum screening in string electrodynamics and in the propagation of charged particles

emitted by the strings. we hope to return to some of these issues in future publications.
