i. introduction

the topological phase transition (tpt) or the berezinskii-kosterlitz-
thouless (bkt) phase transition (pt) takes place in two-dimensional sys-
tems with degenerated vacuum, whose order parameter  = e2i  m = s1.
among them are xy -model, superconductors, bose-liquids and many other
systems.

the main unusual feathers of this tpt are:

1) absence of the spontaneous magnetization in low-t phase (stanley,

kaplan 1966);

2) correlation functions in low-temperature phase must fall o algebraically

(rice 1966).

in particular, xy -model on a lattice is dened as follows

zxy =x exp(h),
j + c.c.) = j x<i,j>

j(i

1

2 x<i,j>

h = 

cos(i  j).

its continuous variant is a nonlinear  -model (nsm) on s1

zn s =z des[], sn s =

1

2z ||2d2x =

2z ()2d2x,

  t /2j.

this form can be also considered as a longwave approximation of the ginzburg-
landau (gl) theory

sgl =z d2x(cid:20) 1

||2 + m 2(||2  1)2(cid:21)

with large m.

a circle s1 has a discrete abelian rst homotopic group 1

1(s1) = z.

due to this property the topologically stable excitations, vortices, are possible
in these systems.

one vortex solution has a form (at large distancies)

(x) =

arctan

y
x

+ 0, x = (x, y)  r2,

where 0 is some constant. its choice denes a form of vortex. for 0 = 0
it is pure potential, and for 0 = /2 it is pure rotational. an account of
vortices means that theory must be considered on the covering space r of
the circle s1 = r/z.

the energy of one vortex with topological charge e  z is logarithmi-

cally divergent

where r is a space radius, a is some short-wave cut-o parameter (a radius

here c(a) is some nonuniversal constant, determining self-energy (or core
energy) of vortices and depending on type of core regularization.

berezinsky (1970,1971), popov (1971,1976) and kosterlitz and thouless
(1973,1974) have shown for the rst time an important role of these topolog-
ical exitations for existence of tpt in two-dimensional systems with contin-
uous abelian symmetry.

these results have stimulated further investigations, given a discovery of
monopoles (polyakov 1974, thooft 1974), instantons (belavin et al. 1975),
and others topological excitations in dierent branches of physics (toulouse
and kleman 1976, volovik and mineev 1977).

the partition function zxy can be approximated by product of two

partition functions (kosterlitz 1974, jose et al.1977)

zxy  zswzcg,

where zcg is the grand partition function of dilute coulomb gase (cg) of
topological exitations with minimal charges e = 1 and zsw is the partition
function of free spin-waves. zcg can be represented, in its turn, in the

4

form of eective eld theory with noncompact eld  and sine-gordon action
ssg (jose et al. 1977, wiegmann 1978)

zcg = zsg =z dessg[],
ssg =z (cid:20) 1

the tpt takes place in the system of vortices and can be described by the
eective sg theory. this system has two dierent phases:

1) high-t phase: plasma-like, massive, with nite correlation length

with essential singularity at tc

  a exp(a ),

 =

1
2

,

 =

t  tc

tc

 0, tc  j;

2) low-t phase: dielectric, massless, with innite correlation length and

algebraically falling correlations.

the tpt in low-dimensional systems can describe such important physi-
cal phenomena as compactication - decompactication (green et al., 1988),
localization - delocalization (langer et al. 1987, schmid 1983, bulgadaev
1984) coherence - decoherence (zaikin and schon 1990) and others. for this
reason it is very interesting to nd the next

possible generalizations of tpt on:

1) multicomponent 2d systems, having more complex vacuum manifolds

m with nontrivial 1(m) ;

2)d-dimensional systems, admitting the interacting topological excita-

tions with logarithmically divergent energies.

5

ii. multicomponent generalization and

spaces with vector 1

1. usual tori.

the simplest generalization of circle

s1 = e2i,

0    1

is a torus t n, which equals to the direct product of n circles

t n = rn/zn =

s1
i ,

n

oi=1

where rn is n -dimensional euclidean space, zn is n -dimensional simple
cubic integer-valued lattice

n

zn =

zi.

mi=1

a torus t n can appear as vacuum manifold of superposition of n indepen-
dent abovementioned gl theories

s =

sgli

n

xi

it is important to note, that a symmetry group of this theory is a semidirect
product of t n and a nite discrete group of permutations instead of usual
continuous unitary or orthogonal groups.

the homotopy group of torus 1(t n) is usually written as

1(t n) =

zi = zn,

n

mi=1

where i -th component describes maps of the boundary s1 into i -th circle
of t n. these circles form so called bouquet of circles (a set of circles with
one common point)

it is clear that maps into dierent components cannot be transformed
into or annihilate each other. consequently, one can introduce in 1(t n)
and in space of corresponding topological charges a vector structure. for
this one needs:

1) a vector basis {ei} ;
2) a metris or/and a scalar product in this space.
in this basis all topological charges must have integer-valued components,

and a scalar product will determine interaction of dierent charges.

q = q1 + q2,

q2 = q2

1 + q2

2 + 2(q1q2).

in general, this metrics is not xed, but is dened by properties of the initial
theory.

for t n a basis {ei} is the canonical one with

(eiej) = ik = gik.

as a result the topological charges, corresponding to dierent s1

i , do
not interact! thus, the theories with m = t n reduce from topological pt
point of view to the case m = s1 . moreover, one can show that all tori
tl = rn/l , where l is some full n -dimensional lattice in rn

l =

n

xi=1

niei, ni  zi, ei  {ei}l,

gik =

i ea
ea
k,

n

xa=1

( {ei}l, i = 1, ..., n forms a basis of lattice l ) reduce in this sence to the
case s1 also. it means that for all systems, having such tori as a vacuum
space, the tpt will have the same properties.

at the same time topological excitations on m with a rank of 1(m)
n  2 can have new additional properties. in particular, they can form knot-
ted congurations in case n = 2. for example, a trefoil knot corresponds
to e = (2, 3) .

2. degenerated (or constrained) tori.

7

for obtaining nontrivial generalizations one must to put on some con-
straints on tori t n and/or on the initial theory. there is a regular method
for obtaining such constraints (bulgadaev 1996) which may be usefull in dif-
ferent regions of physics due to its relation only with theory of simple lie
group g.

proposal:

one must consider theories connected with the cartan tori tg, the
maximal abelian subgroups of the simple compact lie groups g.

tori tg generalize a torus t n = tu (n) . they all can be considered as
appropriately constrained torus t n with large enough n . the correspond-
ing gl type theories can be written out in abstract general form in terms
of group g , but in the real physical systems their forms and corresponding
symmetry breaking must be determined in each case separately, since the
underlying group structure is usually hidden.

two examples.
let us represent a torus t n in a form of diagonal matrix

t n = diag(exp(i1), ..., exp(in)) =

diag(exp(i(e1  ), ..., exp(i(en  )),

where a vector  = (1, ..., n) is introduced.

then

1) a condition pn+1

1 i = 0 for torus t n+1 gives a torus of group g =
an = su(n+1) in fundamental vector representation with vectors {ea}, a =
1, ..., n + 1, directed from origin to the vertices of hypertetrahedron in n -
dimensional space;

2) a reduction of torus t 2n to the form i = n+i, i = 1, ..., n, giving
an additional reection symmetry i  i, i = 1, ..., n, reproduces a torus
of group dn = so(2n) in fundamental vector representation with vectors
{ea}, a = 1, ..., 2n, directed to the vertices of n -dimensional hyperoctahe-
dron.

in general, the cartan torus tg, the maximal abelian subgroup of group

g, consists of elements

g = e2i(h  ), h = {h1, ..., hn}  c, [hi, hj] = 0,

8

where n is a rank of g, c is a maximal commutative cartan subalgebra
of the lie algebra g of the group g. we assume here that (h  ) is usual
euclidean scalar product. due to their commutativity, all hi can be diago-
nalized simultaneously. their eigenvalues, called the weights w, depend on
the concrete representation of g and c . the weights {wa} , a = 1, ..., p ,
belonging to a p -dimensional irreducible representation  (g), form a set of
quantum numbers of this representation.

all possible weights w of the simply connected group g (or of the uni-
versal covering group g of non-simply connected group g ) form a lattice
of weights lw . its basis can be chosen in dierent ways. in some cases the
more convenient basis is a basis of the vectors with minimal norms.

the weight lattice lw , its reciprocal dual root lattice lv, and related
root lattice lr are needed for nding out 1(tg). the last can depend on the
concrete representation  (g). in two above examples the vectors directed to
the vertices of regular polyhedra form the sets of weights of the corresponding
fundamental representations, while their edges form the sets of roots (in this
case the roots and dual roots coincide).

since in any irreducible representation  (g) of dimension p, one can

choose the eigenvectors |a > of h as a basis

h|a >= wa|a >, a = 1, ..., p,

then in this basis all hi (and any element g  tg ) have diagonal form

g = diag(e2i(w1  ), ..., e2i(wp  ))

here some weights can coincide, or even some weights can be equal to 0.

the main dierences of this form from the usual representation of tl

type tori are:

1) a dimension of diagonal matrices coincides with dimension p of  -

representation, which is usually larger, than rank of g ;

2) the set of weights {w} has a discrete weyl (or crystallographic)
symmetry, which ensures weyl invariance of tg and results in the next two
properties

where constant b depends on representation. in case of tg the eective
metrics gik is proportional to the euclidean one.

is a weight lattice of dual group g. for  = min a lattice

 = lv, for  = ad a lattice lt

lw/lv = zg.

thus the set {q} can vary from the set of minimal vectors (it forms the so
called voronoi region or wigner - seitz cell of the corresponding lattice) of the
weight lattice till that of the root lattice. all possible cases are determined
by subgroups of the centre zg. for groups g with zg = 1 the lattices lv
and lw coincide.

 = lw (or lt

when lt
 = lw ) one can reproduce all weights (i.e.
quantum numbers) of group g (or g ) as the vector topological
charges of vortices!

in this relation becomes obvious the important role of tori tg, connected
with self-dual lattices (they are tu (n) and te8 ): all quantum numbers of
corresponding groups have topological interpretation in terms of topological
charges of vortices. when lt

iii.  -models on tg , duality and eective theories

 -model on a circle s1, has the following form

where   =   ,  = 1, 2. it will be convenient below to include a fac-
tor b as a normalization factor into trace t r . this gives us a canonical
euclidean metric in space of topological charges.

these theories are invariant under direct product of right (r) and left (l)

groups n r(l)

g

, which are a semi-direct product of tg and wg

ng = tg  wg.

the group ng is called a normalizator of tg and is a symmetry group of
torus tg.

nsm on tg are the multicomponent generalization of xy -model, having

properties analogouos to those of xy -model:

1) a zero beta-functions () due to atness of tg;
2) non-trivial homotopy group 1 and corresponding vortex solutions.

analogous topological excitations with vectorial charges exist also in the

models of two-dimensional crystall melting (nelson 1978).

in quasi-classical approximation (or in low t expansion) one can represent

a partition function of the  -model on tg

strictly speaking, the eective theories with arbitrary parameters  and 
are more general than initial  -models.

the account of vortices reduces the initial symmetry group ng into dis-
crete dual group wg l1

lattice of potential v ). this dual group generalizes the dual group z2  z
of xy -model.

( wg is a dual weyl group, l1

thus, in this semiclassical and long wavelength approximation

compact theory on a torus tg with continuous symmetry ng ap-
pears equivalent (again modulo z0 ) to noncompact theory with
periodic potential and an innite discrete symmetry.

for simply laced groups the potentials v for groups from series a, d, e
( an = su(n + 1), dn = so(2n), e = e6,7,8 ) coincide with characters of ad-
joint representations of these groups (modulo some constant, corresponding
to zero weight). in this case the general theories can describe systems with
symmetry g broken to ng .

the noncompact theories can be considered also as corresponding linear

 -models. for this reason

compact nonlinear  -models on tg are equivalent in this approxi-
mation to noncompact linear  -models on cartan tori of dual group
tg.

13

iv. phase diagram, critical properties and symmetries

the bkt type pt can be investigated by renormalization of the corre-

sponding eective eld theories (wiegmann 1978, bulgadaev 1981,1996a).

under renormalization transformations both parameters  and  are

renormalized. it is convenient to introduce two dimensionless parameters

(a)2 = g,  =

q2  8

8

where q2 is a square of the norm of the minimal vector topological charges
from {q}. the eective theories are renormalizable only if the vectors from
{q} belong to some lattice (here lt
 ). a new critical properties can appear
only if a geometry of {q} is such that each vector q  {q} can be repre-
sented as a sum of two other vectors from {q} . it means that a potential v
has the next property

v 2 =xa xb
0 + v + xa+b6=c

exp(i(qa + qb,  )) =

exp(i(qa + qb,  )),

where 0 is doubled number of vectors in {q}, having their opposite vectors,
 is a number of times how each vector q can be represented as a sum of two
other vectors from {q}, the last term contains vectors with norm larger than
|q| (so called higher harmonics). an appearence of v on the right hand is
very restrictive (the angles between vectors can be equal only to /3, 2/3
or /2 ) and concides with a denition of the root systems {r} of simple
groups from series a, d, e or with a denition of the root set of the even
integer-valued (in some scale) lattices of a, d, e types. the sets of minimal
roots (or minimal dual roots) of all simple groups belong to four series of
integer-valued lattices a, d, e, z. for theories with sets {q} / a, d, e, all
critical properties will be the same as for theories with {q}  zn .

the rg equations for {q} from these (i.e. g = a, d, e ) lattices have

the next form

dg
dl

= 2g + bgg2,

d
dl

= cgg2.

here bg = g, and cg = 2kg , where kg is the value of the second
casimir operator in adjoint representation (where wa = ra , the roots)

ra
i ra

j = kgij.

xa

14

the rg equations of such type with coecients corresponding to the case
g = a2 have been obtained rstly by nelson (1978) under investigation of
the melting of the two-dimensional triangle lattice.

the eigenvalue of the second casimir operator kg for groups from series
a, d, e can be expressed in terms of the corresponding coxeter number hg

kg = 2hg,

hg =

(number of all roots)

(rank of group)

,

han = n + 1, hdn = 2(n  1), he6,7,8 = 12, 18, 30.

this denition of the coxeter number coincides with that of the coxeter
number of the corresponding integer-valued lattices from series a, d, e. the
coecient bg can be expressed also through the coxeter number

g = kg  4 = 2(hg  2).

thus, all coecients of rg equations depend only on the coxeter
number hg or on the second casimir value kg .

the rg equations have two separatrices with next declinations ( u1 cor-

responds to the phase separation line).

u1,2 = (1/hg, 1/2).

at the pt point (where  =  = 8/r2 = 4 ) an additional logariphmic
factor, related with the null charge behaviour of g and  on the critical
separatrix (the phase separation line), appears in them:

t

yi6=j(cid:18)ln(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where ag = 4/hg is a coecient in rg equations for  on the critical

in this phase additional vortices can move like particles in dielectric me-

dia.

free-like behaviour of the low-temperature phase (except logariphmic cor-
rections at criticality) gives a possibility to use for their description conformal
eld theories with integer central charges c = n , instead of pt points of
two-dimensional systems with discrete symmetries, which are described by
conformal theories with rational central charges (belavin et al. 1984, dot-
senko and fateev 1984,1985). the bkt pt can be considered as some
degeneration of ii order pt: it corresponds to the limiting case k  
(where k is a level) of the sequence of the restricted sg models, describing
minimal conformal theories (smirnov and reshetikhin 1989, leclair 1989).
analogously, tpt in  -models on tg are the limiting cases of unitary min-
imal conformal theories, connected with conformal w -algebras (fateev and
lukyanov 1988). in this relation it is interesting to note that there exists
a puzzling coincidence of g with screening factor in formulas for central
charges of the ane lie algebras g (kac 1990) at level k = 2 (though tg
corresponds to k = 1 )

ck =

et al. 1985,1986) at level k = 1

(k + hg)(k + hg + 1)(cid:19) .

17

properties of massive phase

in this phase all additional vector charges will be shielded like in plasma.
a separatrix 2 is a boundary of the asymptotically free (af) region in uv-
limit. there is also another possibility of the enhancement of the symmetry
of the initial nonlinear  -model on this separatrix.  -model has at classical
level two symmetries: 1) scale (or conformal) symmetry, 2) isotopic global
symmetry ng = tg  wg. conformal symetry is spontaneously broken in
ir region by vortices. for this reason  -model has in massive phase a nite
correlation length   m1 , where m is a characteristic mass scale of the
theory. this mass must depend on the coupling constant  or . the
behaviour of m near pt point is described by above formula, where

 

  c

c

.

on separatrix 2 one obtaines

m   exp (1/2ghg),   a1.

the fact that on a separatrix 2 a mass scale is dened by kg  hg is a
corollary of the independence of its declination on g.

this expression coincides with those for chiral models on groups (polyakov
1975, ogievetskii, wiegmann, 1986) and with those, obtained from an exact
solution of the appropriate fermion theories in main approximation on g
(destri, de vega 1987)

m   exp(2/(gkg/2)).

thus,

mass scale on separatrix 2 coincides (at least for g = a, d, e ) with
that for all g -invariant theories (chiral and fermionic), connected
with simple lie groups g.

it means a possible restoration of the full symmetry group g in  -models
with reduced symmetries ng . this can be seen also from the equivalence
of the eective eld theories in cases g = an1 = su(n), g = dn = o(2n),
to the fermion theories with the same glodal symmetry groups g (coleman
1975, mandelstam 1975, bulgadaev 1981, 1983)

there is strong dependence of the index () , which interpolates between
 = g near the pt point and  = 1 near the separatrix 2. the rst
region corresponds to symmetry of tg, which is a torus normalisator ng =
tg wg, while the second one corresponds to more symmetric, g -invariant,
situation.

another interesting application of tpt in nsm on tg is connected with
string theory and its cosmological aspects. in this case tpt can be consid-
ered as eective decompactication pt (bulgadaev 1998), a massive phase
corresponds to a compactied phase and a massless phase corresponds to a
decompactied phase.

v. d-dimensional conformal  -model

and topological excitations

1. d-dimensional generalization.

importance of topological exitations with logariphmically divergent en-
ergies in 1d systems has been earlier discovered by anderson, yuval and
hamann in 1970, in papers devoted to the kondo problem. it was shown
there that pt takes place in 1d ising system with long-range interaction

j(r)  1/r2

due to the presence of logariphmically interacting domain walls.

the next properties unify these two models and give the conditions of
existence of topological exitations with logariphmic energy in d-dimensional
ns models:

1) conformal invariance at classical level,
2) homotopical group d1(m) must be nontrivial abelian discrete.
the rst property denes form of action s and the second one denes

partially a topology of m

s =

1

2z ddxddxa(x) (d)

ab (x  x)b(x),

where   m, a, b = 1, 2..., n, n is a dimension of m and a form of kernel
 depends on dimension of space d . for decoupled internal and physical
spaces  can be decomposed

(d)

ab (x) = gabd(x),

19

where gab is the euclidean metric of the space rn (n) , in which a manifold
m can be embedded. in the momentum space, for small k

d(k)  |k|d(1 + a1(ka) + ...),

where a is a uv cut-o parameter. action s can be named d -dimensional
conformal nonlinear  -model. the kernel d generalizes an usual local and
conformal kernel of two-dimensional  -model

(k)  2(k) = k2.

for local models an expression for  can be dened in terms of manifold
m only

(x) = gab()(x)

in odd dimensions d is nonlocal

d(x)  1/|x|2d,

but the models with such kernels are used often in physics.

the simplest spaces with such properties are the spheres sd1 . in 3d
case this is a conformal (or van der waals, since 3(x)  1/|x|6 ) ns-models
on sphere s2.

an existence of topological excitations with logarithmic energy follows
from the invariance of the kernel b and the simplest topologically nontrivial
excitations ni = xi/r under scale and conformal transformations

xi  x

i = xi/r2,

r  r = 1/r,

xi/r = x

i/r,

and, consequently,

is invariant and dimensionless. by direct calculation one can show that

where cd = 16
inverse to 3(x), which has a logariphmic behaviour at large distancies

 , and dierent excitations interact through potential g(r),

g(r)  ln

.

2. multicomponent generalization for d > 2 .

a simple generalization of the sphere sd1 , analogous to the torus t n

in 2d case, is a bouquet of n spheres

bd1

n

n = sd1

1  ...  sd1

and all spaces m with this rst nontrivial topological cell complex. but
the corresponding vector topological charges will not interact as in a case
of torus. for obtaining an interaction of topological charges in 3d case one
needs to consider ns-models on deformed bn .
in particular, ns-models
on the maximal ag spaces fg = g/tg of the simple compact groups g ,
with 2(fg) = lv, (note that a sphere s2 is a particular case of fg :
s2 = su(2)/u(1) ) will also have topological excitations with interacting
vector topological charges q  lv and logariphmic energy.

thus, these excitations will have the mixed properties of the two-dimensional

vortices and instantons: their topology is connected with 2 , but they in-
teract as vortices.

vi. conclusions

1.

it is shown that one must consider deformed tori for obtaining the

interacting vector topological charges.

2. vector topological charges form a lattice and in some cases can repro-

duce all quantum numbers of the corresponding groups.

3. a sequence of approximately equivalent transformations of 2d models

is constructed

general gl theory  ns model  topexcgas

 general sg theory

it simplies a problem and extracts all necessary long-wave properies of
these theories! here last theory has a pure group-theoretical structure and
is universal for whole class of theories with the same symmetries.

21

4. all critical properties are classied by integer-valued lattices from series

a, d, e, z and are characterised by the corresponding coxeter numbers.

5. the possible scenarios of the dynamical enlargening of the initial

internal symmetry groups is proposed.

6. d-dimensional conformal ns-models, having the topological excita-

tions with logarithmic energies, are constructed.

i would like to thank the organizers of the workshop for the invitation

and the opportunity to give this talk.
