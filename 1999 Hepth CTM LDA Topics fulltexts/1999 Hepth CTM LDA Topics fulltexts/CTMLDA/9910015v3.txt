abstract

we determine the instanton corrections to the eective coupling in su (2),
n = 2 yang-mills theory with four avours to all orders. our analysis uses the
s(2, z)-invariant curve and the two instanton contribution obtained earlier to x
the higher order contributions uniquely.

1 introduction

seiberg and witten [1, 2] proposed exact results for su(2), n = 2 supersymmetric
yang-mills theory with and without matter multiplets. these include, in particular an
exact expression for the mass spectrum of bps-states for these theories. their solu-
tions also provide a mechanism, based on monopole condensation, for chiral symmetry
breaking and connement in n = 2 yang-mills with and without coupling to fundamen-
tal hypermultiplets respectively. the results of seiberg and witten have since been
generalised to a variety of gauge groups [3] describing a number of interesting new
phenomena [4].

on another front the low energy eective theories arising from non-abelian ym-
theory have been identied with those describing the low energy dynamics of certain
intersecting brane congurations in string theory [5]. this approach to eld theory
has the advantage of providing an elegant geometrical representation of the low energy
dynamics of strongly coupled supersymmetric gauge theory.

for gauge groups su(2) and nf  3 massless avours it has since been shown
that the solution [1, 2] are indeed the only ones compatible with supersymmetry and
asymptotic freedom in these theories [6]. however, a number of issues have still resisted
an exact treatment. in particular the precise relation between the low energy eective
coupling e and the microscopic coupling  in the scale invariant nf = 4 theory has
not been understood so far.
indeed, while the two couplings were rst assumed to
be identical in [2] it was later found by explicit computation that there are, in fact,
perturbative as well as instanton corrections [7]. on the other hand, explicit instanton
calculus is so far limited to topological charge k  2. a related observation has been
made in the d-brane approach to scale invariant theories. the details of the conclusions
reached there are, however, somewhat dierent [8].

the purpose of the present paper is to ll this gap. our analysis uses a combination
of analytic results from the theory of conformal mappings combined with the known
results form instanton calculus. more precisely we consider the sequence  7 z 
c 7 e. we will then argue that given the seiberg-witten curve together with some
suitable assumptions on the singular behaviour of the instanton contributions there is
a one-parameter family of admissible maps e 7  . the remaining free parameter
is in turn determined by the two-instanton contribution to the asymptotic expansion
at weak coupling. this coecient has been computed explicitly in [7]. combining
these results then determines the map completely. although we are not able to give
a closed form of the map  7 e globally the higher order instanton coecients
can be determined iteratively. we further discuss some global properties of the map
qualitatively. in particular we will see that it is not single valued meaning that the
instanton corrections lead to a cut in the strong coupling regime.
in this note we
restrict ourselves to gauge group su(2) leaving the extension to higher groups [9] for
future work.

2 review of n=2 yang-mills with 4 flavours

to prepare the ground let us rst review some of the relevant features of the theory of
interest [2], that is n = 2 ym-theory with 4 hypermultiplets qr and qr, r = 1,   , 4, in

1

the fundamental representation. in n = 1 language the hypermultiplets are described
by two chiral multiplets containing the left handed quarks and anti quarks respec-
tively. these are in isomorphic representations of the gauge group su(2). the global
symmetry group therefore contains a so(8) or, more precisely, a o(8) due to invari-
ance under the z2 parity which exchanges a left handed quark with its anti particle,
q1  q1, with all other elds invariant. at the quantum level this z2 is anomalous
due to contributions from odd instantons.
we consider the coulomb branch with a constant scalar  = a 6= 0 in the n = 2
vector multiplet. this breaks the gauge group su(2)  u(1). the charged hypermul-
tiplets then have mass m =2|a| and transform as a vector under so(8), rather than
o(8) due to the z2-anomaly. in addition, there are magnetic monopole solutions lead-
ing to 8 fermionic zero modes from the 4 hypermultiplets. these turn the monopoles
into spinors of so(8). the symmetry group is therefore the universal cover of so(8)
or spin(8) with centre z2  z2. following [2] we label the representations z2  z2
according to the spin(8) representations, that is the trivial representation o, the vector
representation v and the two spinor representations s and c. to decide in which spinor
representation the monopoles and dyons transform one considers the action of an elec-
tric charge rotation eiq on these states. here the electric charge q is normalised such
that the massive gauge bosons have charge 2. this action is conveniently described
by
(1)
where states with even, odd ne are (1)h even, odd respectively. on the other hand,
for consistency, the monopole anti-monopole annihilation process requires a correlation
between chirality in spin(8) and electric charge [2]. we therefore identify (1)h with
the chirality operator in the spinor representations of spin(8). hence dyons with even
and odd electric charge transform in one or the other spinor representation of spin(8)
respectively. there is an outer automorphism s3 of spin(8) that permutes the three
non-trivial representations v, s and c. it is closely connected to the proposed duality
group sl(2, z) of the quantum theory. indeed there is a homomorphism sl(2, z) 
s3, so that the invariance group of the spectrum is given by the semi direct product
spin(8) and sl(2, z). the kernel of this homomorphism plays an important part in
our analysis below.
it consists of the matrices congruent to 1 (mod(2)). they are
conjugate to the subgroup 0(2). the fundamental domain of this subgroup is the
space of inequivalent eective couplings e.

eiq = einm(1)h,

one can further formalise this structure in terms of the hyperelliptic curve that
controls the low energy behaviour of the model [2]. for this one seeks a curve y2 =
f (x, u,  ) such that the dierential form

has the periods ( ad

the curve consistent with sl(2, z) duality determined in [2], is given by

and ad = ea.

y2 = (x  ue1( ))(x  ue2( ))(x  ue2( )),

where ei( ) are the modular forms corresponding to the three subgroups of sl(2, z),
conjugate to the index 3 subgroup 0(2).

3 map:  7 e

we now have the necessary ingredients to determine the precise relation between e
and  . we begin with the observation that, according to the structure of the eective
theory presented above, the fundamental domain d of any of the three subgroups
conjugate to 0(2) can be used as the space of inequivalent eective couplings. the
three choices are then related by the spin(8) triality relating the 3 dierent non-trivial
representations v, s and c. each fundamental domain is described by a triangle in the
upper half plane (im( )  0), bounded by circular arcs [10]. the 3 singularities are
conjugate to the points (i,1, 1) corresponding to the weak coupling regime, massless
monopoles and massless dyons with charge (nm, ne) = (1, 1) mod(2) respectively.
in the absence of perturbative- and instanton corrections the eective coupling
is identied with the microscopic coupling  . this is the case in n = 4 theories.
in the scale invariant n = 2 theory considered here the situation is dierent. as
shown in [7], the eective coupling is nitely renormalised at the one loop level and
furthermore receives instanton corrections. as a result the fundamental domain d,
of inequivalent microscopic couplings and the fundamental domain d, of inequivalent
eective couplings are not the same. we will now determine the exact relation between
them.

some information about the fundamental domain d of microscopic couplings  is

obtained from the following observations:
a) as the microscopic coupling does not enter in the mass formula, its fundamental
domain is not constrained to be that of a subgroup of sl(2, z) [6]. nevertheless we
require that the imaginary part of  be bounded from below. correspondingly the
dierent determinations of  for a given e must be related by a transformation in
g  p sl(2, ir). hence, a particular determination of  . will lie within a fundamental
domain of g or some covering thereof. that is,

  c[h/g] where g  p sl(2, ir),

(5)

where c[ ] denotes a certain covering. any such domain is bounded by circular arcs
and is thus conformally equivalent to the punctured 2-sphere, c  {a1,   , an} [10].
b) we know of no principle excluding the possibility that the number of vertices of
d be dierent from that of d. on the other hand such extra singularities have no
obvious physical interpretation. we therefore discard this possibility.

equipped with this information we will now determine the homomorphism that
maps d into the fundamental domain of microscopic couplings1 d. it follows from
general arguments [2, 7] that this map has an expansion of the form

e =



xn=0

q = ei

the coecients ci, represent the perturbative one-loop (i = 0) and instanton (i > 0)
corrections respectively. the contributions from odd instantons to e vanishes. this
is due the fact that the part of the eective action determining the eective coupling
is invariant under the z2-parity described in the last section. the rst two non-
vanishing coecients of the expansion (6) are known [7]. they are

c0 =

i

and c2 = 

i

(7)

to continue we use some elements of the theory of conformal mappings [10]. that
is we consider the maps from the punctured 2-sphere s = c{a1,   , an} to polygons
in the upper half plane, bounded by circular arcs. concretely we consider the sequence
e 7 z  s 7  (see fig.1). the form of such mappings is generally complicated.
however, their schwarzian derivative takes a remarkably simple form [10]

the parameters i measure the angles of the polygon in units of . the accessory pa-
rameters i do not have a simple geometric interpretation but are determined uniquely
up to a sl(2, c) transformation of s. furthermore they satisfy the conditions [10]

i = 0

(9)

in the present situation it is convenient to orient the polygons such that they have
a vertex at innity with zero angle (see fig. 1 ) corresponding to the weak coupling
singularity ( = e = i). the above conditions then simplify to



i = 0

xi=1
xi=1 (cid:16)2aii  2

i(cid:17) = (2  n).

as explained at the beginning of this section, in the case at hand, the polygon
on the e-side corresponds to the fundamental domain of 0(2). the corresponding
parameters (ai, i, i) are given by [6]

a1 = a1 = 1,

1 = 1 =

,

i = 0.

(11)

the parameters for the polygon on the  -side, (ai, i, i) are to be determined. how-
ever, the conditions (10) together with the symmetry    leaves only one free
parameter. indeed, without restricting the generality we can choose ai = ai. further-
more i =i. then (10) implies

1 =  1 =

(12)

leaving only one parameter, 1 say, undetermined. as we shall now see this parameter
is in turn determined by the two instanton contribution in (6). for this we make use
of the identity

to continue we invert (6) as

finally we need the form of e(z), that is the inverse modular function for 0(2) [11, 6]

e = i

substituting (16) into the right hand side of (13) we end up with

substitution of (17) into (13) then leads to

which then xes the erstwhile free parameter in {, z}. this is the result we have been
aiming at. indeed all higher instanton coecients are now determined implicitly by
the equation

{, e} =   z

e!2

[{, z}  {e, z}] .

(19)

in order to integrate (13) one notices [11] that any solution of (8) can be written

as a quotient

 (z) =

(u1(z) + du2(z))
(eu1(z) + f u2(z))

,

(20)

where u1, u2 are two linearly independent solutions of the hypergeometric dierential
equation

this then integrates (13). to extract the instanton coecients one needs the inverse
map e( ). this can be done iteratively. we have done this to o(q4) allowing us to

(26)

we close with the observation that globally the inverse function e( ) cannot be
single valued. indeed, existence of a single valued inverse function z( ) requires 1 = p
or  = 1/p, p  z [11]. as a consequence, the instanton corrected eective coupling
e( ) has a cut somewhere in the strong coupling region. it would certainly be inter-
esting to understand the origin of this branch cut from the non-perturbative physics
of this model. thus far this remains elusive to us.
