abstract

in this paper we show that the one-loop graviton self-energy contribution
is ultraviolet nite, without introducing counterterms, and cuto-free in
the framework of causal perturbation theory. in addition, it satises the
gravitational slavnovward identities for the two-point connected green
function. the condition of perturbative gauge invariance to second order
for loop graphs is proved. corrections to the newtonian potential are also
derived.

introduction

in the eld-theoretical approach to general relativity, einsteins theory can be
reduced to a theory of gravitation in at space-time by an expansion of the
gravitational lagrangian density, the hilberteinstein lagrangian density lhe,
as an innite series in power of the gravitational coupling constant .
in such an expansion the inherent non-linearity of einstein equations ap-
pears as a non-linear interaction between gravitons due to their gravitational
weight. thus, einsteins theory will be considered as a self-interaction of or-
dinary massless rank-2 symmetric tensor gauge elds in at space-time. the
lorentz covariant quantization program for the so obtained eld theory was
proposed in [1], [2], [3],

[4], [5], [6] and [7] (and references therein).

for an ample treatment of this subject, see [8], [9] and [10].
although covariant feynman rules in quantum gravity (qg) were soon de-
rived [11], [12] which allowed a calculable perturbative expansion of qg [13],
it was soon realized that in the standard perturbative framework radiative
corrections within the theory were plagued by severe ultraviolet (uv) diver-
gences [14], [15] (for a review, see [16], [17], [18]).

it turned out that pure (that is without matter elds) qg was one-loop nite
due to the gaussbonett identity in four dimensions. the obtained one-loop di-
vergences are such that they can be transformed away by a eld renormalization.
but two-loop calculations [19], [20], [21] yield non-renormalizable divergences.
in the meantime, it was realized that the reason for the uv divergences
lies basically in the fact that one performs mathematically ill-dened opera-
tions, when using feynman rules for closed loop graphs, because one multiplies
feynman propagators as if they were ordinary functions.

therefore a new strategy was developed in order to avoid the appearance
of uv divergences once and for all. this was done by epstein and glaser in
the early seventies [22], then further applied to qed by scharf [23] and to
yangmills theories by dutsch et al. [24].

in the resulting scheme, called causal perturbation theory, the central ob-
ject is the s-matrix, whose perturbative expansion is computed taking causality
as a cornerstone so that all expressions are nite and well-dened. uv nite-
ness is then a consequence of a deeper mathematical understanding of how loop
graph contributions have to be calculated.

therefore, power-counting perturbative renormalizability no longer repre-
sents a criterion for distinguishing viable theories from ill-dened unrealistic
theories.

within the causal perturbation scheme, one-loop contributions to graviton
self-energy are calculated in this paper and shown to be uv nite without
the introduction of a regularization scheme and therefore cuto-free. the ob-
tained graviton self-energy tensor depends logarithmically on a mass scale, which
breaks scale invariance, and satises the appropriate gravitational slavnov
ward identities [13], [25], [26], only if graviton and ghost loops are added up

3

together.

an aspect of causal theory applied to qg relies in the fact that one works
with free graviton elds in a xed gauge, therefore, for general gauge calculations
we refer to [27], [28].

although in this paper we do not present two-loop calculation, the causal

method ensures us of their uv niteness [29].

for the explicit quantization of the graviton eld and the subsequent con-
struction of the physical subspace of the graviton fock space which contains
physical graviton states and for the proof of unitarity of the s-matrix restricted
to the physical subspace, we refer to [30], which also provides us with the basic
notations and denitions.

qg coupled to photon elds and to scalar matter elds within causal per-

turbation theory is considered in [31] and [32], respectively.

the paper is organized as follow:

in the next section, after a brief intro-
duction to causal perturbation theory, the transition from general relativity to
perturbative quantum gravity in the causal approach is grounded and the con-
dition of perturbative gauge invariance is presented and some consequences are
drawn.
in sec. 3 the inductive construction of the graviton self-energy con-
tributions is explicity carried out, the issues of non-normalizability of qg and
distribution splitting are touched on. in sec. 4 the slavnovward identities for
the two-point function under investigation are veried and in sec. 5 the nor-
malization freedom inherent in the causal inductive construction is investigated.
corrections to the newtonian potential through graviton self-energy loops are
discussed in sec. 6, while perturbative gauge invariance to second order in the
loop graph sector is shown in sec. 7. in the technical appendices, the formulae
needed for the causal construction of the 2-point distributions and for the sum
of self-energy insertions are derived.

we use the unit convention:  = c = 1, greek indices , , . . . run from 0 to

3, whereas latin indices i, j, . . . run from 1 to 3.

2 graviton coupling and perturbative gauge invari-

ance

2.1 s-matrix inductive construction

the central object of causal perturbation theory [23], [29], [30] is the scattering
matrix s. being a formal power series in the coupling constant, we consider it
as a sum of smeared operator-valued distributions of the following form:

s(g) = 1 +



xn=1

1

n!z d4x1 . . . d4xn tn(x1, . . . , xn) g(x1)  . . .  g(xn) ,

(2.1)

where g is a schwartz test function (g  s(r4)) which switches the interaction
and provides a natural infrared cuto in the long-range part of the interaction.

4

the s-matrix maps the asymptotically incoming free elds on the outgoing
in causal

ones and it is possible to express the tns by means of free elds.
perturbation theory interacting quantum elds do not appear.

the n-point operator-valued distribution tn is a well-dened renormalized
time-ordered product expressed in terms of wick monomials of free elds. tn
is constructed inductively from the rst order t1(x), which corresponds to the
interaction lagrangian in terms of free elds, and from the lower orders tj,
j = 2, . . . , n  1 by means of poincare covariance and causality.
order without introducing any counterterm.

causality leads directly to uv nite and cuto-free tn-distributions in every

2.2 first order graviton interaction

following the usual approach [13], [25], we start from the hilberteinstein la-
grangian (without cosmological constant)

lhe = 2

2

gr ,

(2.2)

where r is the ricci scalar and 2 = 32  g with g = newtons constant. we
use the same notations as in [30] and [33]. expanding the goldberg variable

g := g g in an asymptotically at geometry
g (x) =  +  h (x) ,

(2.3)

where  = diag(1,1,1,1) is the at space-time metric tensor, we nd the
non-terminating expansion of lhe

lhe =



xj=0

j l(j)
he ,

(2.4)

where l(j)
he represents an interaction involving j + 2 gravitons. eq. (2.3) denes
the dynamical graviton eld h (x) propagating in the at space-time geometry.
he is quadratic in h (x) and in the hilbert gauge

the lowest order l(0)

h (x), = 0 the graviton eld h (x) obeys the wave equation

 h (x) = 0 .

(2.5)

since the perturbative expansion for the s-matrix (2.1) is in powers of the
coupling constant , we consider the normally ordered product of the rst order
term in (2.4)

t h
1 (x) = i  :l(1)

he(x) := i

as the non-linear cubic interaction between gravitons or rst order graviton
interaction. for brevity, we omit the space-time dependence of the elds, if the
meaning is clear.

for convenience of notation, the trace of the graviton eld is written as
h = h
 and all lorentz indices of the graviton elds are written as superscripts
whereas the derivatives acting on the elds are written as subscripts. all indices
occurring twice are contracted by the minkowski metric  .

the non-renormalizability problem of quantum gravity arises because of
the presence of two derivatives on the graviton elds in (2.6) whose origin lies
in the dimensionality of the coupling constant: [] = mass1.

2.3 quantization of the graviton field, perturbative gauge in-

variance and ghost coupling

we consider the graviton eld h (x) as a free quantum tensor eld which sat-
ises the wave equation (2.5) and quantize it by imposing the lorentz covariant
commutation rule

with

(cid:2)h(x), h (y)(cid:3) = i b d0(x  y) ,
2(cid:16) +    (cid:17) ;

b :=

and d0(x) is the mass-zero jordanpauli causal distribution:

d0(x) = d(+)

0 (x) + d()
i

0 (x) =

(2)3 z d4p (p2) sgn(p0) ei px .

=

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

the gauge content of quantum gravity is formulated by means of the lorentz

invariant and time-independent gauge charge q:

q := zx0=const

d3x h(x),


0
x u(x) ,

(2.10)

where u(x) is a c-number vector eld satisfying u(x) = 0. the gauge charge
generates the innitesimal operator gauge transformation of the graviton eld
h (x):

dqh (x) :=(cid:2)q, h (x)(cid:3) = i bu(x), .

the ten components of the symmetric rank-2 tensor h contain more than the
true physical degrees of freedom of a massless spin-2 particle, this additional
freedom could be suppressed by a gauge condition h
, = 0 and a trace condition

(2.11)

6

h = 0. as in gauge theories these conditions are disregarded at the beginning
and considered later as conditions on the physical states. in [30] the explicit
construction of the fock space for the physical graviton states is carried out
and there it is shown that the physical subspace can be dened as fphys =
ker(cid:0){q, q}(cid:1).

gauge invariance of the s-matrix means

lim

g1(cid:2)q, s(g)(cid:3) = 0 .

(2.12)

inserting in (2.12) the perturbative expansion of s(g), eq. (2.1), we get the
perturbative gauge invariance condition for the n-point distributions tn:

dqtn(x1, . . . , xn) = sum of divergences ,

(2.13)

because divergences do not contribute in the adiabatic limit g  1 due to partial
integration and gauss theorem.
1 (x) 6=
divergence. this requires the introduction of an interaction between graviton,
ghost and anti-ghost, i.e. the rst order ghost coupling [35], [36]

for n = 1 the above requirement is not at all trivial, because dqt h

, :  : u

, :(cid:1) ,
(cid:8)u(x), u (y)(cid:9) = i  d0(x  y) ,

(2.14)

(2.15)

whereas all other anti-commutators vanish. the ghost and anti-ghost elds
undergo the innitesimal operator gauge variations

dqu(x) :=(cid:8)q, u(x)(cid:9) = 0 ,

dq u(x) :=(cid:8)q, u(x)(cid:9) = i h(x),

under the action of q, so that the sum of (2.6) and (2.14) preserves perturbative
gauge invariance (2.13) to rst order [33]:

(x) = dq(cid:0)t h

1 (x)(cid:1) =: x

 t 

1/1(x) .

one possible form of t 

1/1(x), the so-called q-vertex, was derived in [33].

the denition of the q-vertex from eq. (2.17) allows us to give a precise
prescription on how the right side of eq. (2.13) has to be inductively constructed:
we dene the concept of perturbative quantum operator gauge invariance by
the equation

(2.17)

dqtn(x1, . . . , xn) =


x
l

t 
n/l(x1, . . . , xl, . . . , xn) ,

(2.18)

where t 
n/l is the renormalized time-ordered product, obtained according to
the inductive causal scheme, with a q-vertex at xl, while all other n 1 vertices
are ordinary t1-vertices.

2.4 consequences of perturbative gauge invariance to second

order for two-point distributions

we derive now some consequences from the condition of perturbative gauge
1 + t u
invariance to second order for loop graphs. from the structure of t1 = t h
1 ,
it follows straightforwardly that by performing two eld contractions (3.1) the
resulting 2-point distribution t2(x, y) will be of the form

t2(x, y) =+ : h (x)h (y) : i thh(z) + : h (x),h (y) : i thh(z)

|

+

+ : h (x)h (y), : i thh(z)
+ : u(x)u(y), : i tu u(z)|
+ : u(x), u(y), : i tu u(z)|

| + : h(x),h (y), : i thh(z)

|

| + : u(x),u(y) : i t uu(z)|
| + : u(x),u(y), : i t uu(z)|
| ,

| +

(2.19)

where z := x  y. the subscript on the numerical t-distribution denotes the
structure of the external elds attached to them. this t2(x, y) describes the
graviton self-energy and the ghost self-energy. the corresponding tensors will
be given in sec. 3.6 and in sec. 7.1, respectively.

perturbative gauge invariance to second order

dqt2(x, y) = x

 t 

2/1(x, y) + y

 t 

2/2(x, y)

(2.20)

enables us to derive a set of identities for these distributions by comparing the
distributions attached to same external operators on both sides of (2.20).

the right side of (2.20) is obtained by calculating the innitesimal gauge
variations of the external elds1 by means of eqs. (2.11) and (2.16) and by
isolating terms with external operators of the type : u(x)h(y) : so that

dqt2(x, y) = +bh : u(x),h (y) : thh(z) + : u(x),,h (y) : thh(z)

+ : u(x),h (y), : thh(z)
+ : u(x)h (y),, : tu u(z)|

| + : u(x),,h (y) : thh(z)
|  + : u(x),h (y),, : tu u(z)|

|  .

i +

(2.21)

|

|

2/1 + y

 t 

on the other side, x
2/2 contains also operators of this type. using
a simplied notation which keeps track of the eld type, of the derivatives and
of the position of the -index which forms the divergence in (2.20), then the
q-vertex of (2.17) reads (see [33] for the detailed form):

 t 

t 
1/1(x) :=+ : uhx

 h : + : uhx

+ : u hh : + : uhh : + : uhh : + : x
+ : uuu : + : uuu : + : uuu : ,

 h : + : u hh : + : uhh : +
 uuu : +

(2.22)

1dq(: uu :) =  : u{q, u} :=  : uh : and dq(: uu :) =: {q, u}u :=: hu :

8

while the normal vertex reads

t1 :=: hhh : + :  uhu : + :  uhu : .

(2.23)

then, performing two contractions between t 
in t 

2/1 which have external operators of the type : u(x)h(y) : are

1/1(x) and t1(y), the contributions

2/1(x, y) =+ : u(x),h 
t

.

|

(2.24)

one should not forget that there exist also terms with external operators of the
type : u(x)h(y) : coming from t 
2/2(x, y), which is inductively constructed with
t1(x) and t 

1/1(y). they read

(2.25)

 to t 

here, the numerical distributions are denoted by l. according to eq. (2.20), we
have to apply x
2/2, (2.25). after that we gather the
various terms according to their lorentz structures given by the position of the
indices and the number of derivatives acting on the external elds. we compare
then the c-number distributions attached to the external operators:

these identities hold among the c-number 2-point distributions constructed in
second order perturbation theory. some of them have been explicity checked
by calculations, but there is no doubt about their validity, because in sec. 7.2,
the condition (2.20) of perturbative gauge invariance to second order for loop
graphs is proved.

10

in the case of qg coupled to photon elds [31] and scalar matter elds [32],
these identities are less involved and from them we can derive easily the slavnov
ward identities for the 2-point connected green function with photon and mat-
ter loop, respectively.

3 two-point distribution for graviton self-energy

it is our aim in this section to apply the causal scheme to qg in order to cal-
culate the 2-point distribution t2(x, y) which describes the graviton self-energy
contribution. we explain step by step how t2(x, y) has to be constructed ac-
cording to the general rules of the causal scheme [23].

the are two important pieces in the inductive calculation that we are going
to carry out: the rst one is the calculation in momentum space of the product
of positive/negative parts of jordanpauli distributions (see app. 1 and app. 2
for the technical details) and the second one is the causal splitting procedure
(see sec. 3.5) according to the correct singular order (see sec. 3.4).

3.1 inductive construction

first of all, from the commutation rules (2.7) and (2.15) we compute the con-
tractions between two eld operators:

c(cid:8)h(x) h (y)(cid:9) :=(cid:2)h(x)(), h (y)(+)(cid:3) = i b d(+)
c(cid:8)u(x) u (y)(cid:9) :=(cid:8)u(x)(), u (y)(+)(cid:9) = +i  d(+)
c(cid:8)u(x) u(y)(cid:9) :=(cid:8)u(x)(), u(y)(+)(cid:9) = i  d(+)
0 (x  y) ;

0 (x  y) ,

0 (x  y) ,

where () refers to the positive/negative frequency part of the corresponding
quantity.
the rst step in the construction of t2(x, y) consists in calculating the aux-

iliary distributions

2(x, y) := t h+u
r

(y) t h+u

(x) , a

2(x, y) := t h+u

(3.2)

causal means that the numerical part of d2(x, y) has support inside the light
cone. being t h+u
(x) a normally ordered product, we have to carry out all
the possible contractions between the two factors in (3.2) using wicks lemma.
in this manner d2(x, y) contains tree contributions or scattering graphs (only
one contraction and four external legs), loop contributions (two contractions
and two external legs) and vacuum graph contributions (three contractions and
no external legs). note that, due to the presence of normal ordering, tadpole
diagrams do not appear in causal perturbation theory.

3.2 example of the calculation



let us illustrate how to construct d2(x, y) by explicitly working out an example.
we take into account only the rst term in the graviton coupling t h
1 (x) so that,
2(x, y)-distribution that can be decomposed as a sum of 25 dierent
from the a
2(x, y)(1,1), and
in addition we carry out the loop generating double-contractions only between
graviton elds that carry derivatives, so that for a

i,j=1 a

2(x, y)(1,1) we obtain

therefore, according to eq. (3.3), the d2(x, y)-distribution has the form

the most important property of d2(x, y) is causality, but only the numerical

distribution d2(x  y) is responsible for this property:

supp(cid:0)d2(z)(cid:1)  v +(z)  v (z) , with z := x  y ,

(see below). the products of jordanpauli distributions appearing in (3.10) are
easily expressed in momentum space, see app. 2, so that we obtain

(3.11)

a
2(p)(1,1)
r
2(p)(1,1)

 =  p (p)(4)
 =  p (p)(4)

 (p2) (+p0) ,
 (p2) (p0) ;

(3.12)

and therefore

d2(p)(1,1)

 = p (p)(4)

 (p2)h(p0)  (p0)(cid:3) = p (p) (p2) sgn(p0) ,

(3.13)

where p (p)(4)
 is a lorentz covariant polynomial of degree four, this degree is
given by the number of derivatives on the contracted lines. causality is evident
from the scalar distribution d(p) := (p2)sgn(p0). for z2 < 0, we may choose a
reference frame in which z = (0, z), so that

d(z) =

1

(2)2z dp0 sgn(p0)z d3p (p2

0  p2) e+i pz = 0 ,

(3.14)

because of the signum-function in p0. therefore d(z) vanishes outside the light
cone, see eq. (3.11).

3.3 causal d2(x, y)-distribution for graviton self-energy

the total d2(x, y)-distribution for the graviton self-energy through a graviton
loop is obtained by calculating the 25 contributions coming from the graviton
coupling t h
1 , not only the terms with two external graviton elds without deriva-
tives, but also these with one or two derivatives. in addition, there are also 16
contributions coming from the ghost-graviton coupling where one performs two
ghostanti-ghost contractions. summing graviton loop and ghostanti-ghost
loop contributions we obtain 2

d2(x, y) =+ : h(x)h (y) : d(4)

+ : h(x),h (y) : d(3a)
+ : h(x)h (y), : d(3b)

i = 4, 3a, 3b, 2 .

(3.16)

the explicit results for the tensorial distributions, being too long and not very
illuminating, are not given here; these will be used to calculate the graviton
self-energy tensor in sec. 3.6.

in order to obtain t2(x, y), we have to split the d2-distribution into a re-
tarded part, r2, and an advanced part, a2, with respect to the coincidence
point z := x  y = 0, so that supp(r2(z))  v +(z) and supp(a2(z))  v (z).
the correct treatment of this coincidence point constitutes the key to control
the uv behaviour of the 2-point distribution.

this splitting procedure aects only the numerical distributions d(i)

and must be accomplished according to the correct singular order (d(i)
distribution.
z = 0, or that of d(i)
on the other side, if (d(i)

 (4)(x  y) ,

(3.17)

and a retarded part r(i)
2 (x y) is best obtained in momentum space by means of
a dispersion-like integral, see sec. 3.5, which, however, presents some diculties
in the massless case.

the ca,is in eq. (3.17) are undetermined but nite normalization constants,
that will be discussed in sec. 5 by taking physical conditions into account. da
is a partial dierential operator acting on the local (4)(x y)-distribution. the
second term on the right side of eq. (3.17) represents therefore a normalization
freedom which is inherent to the causal splitting of distributions.

in the case of eq. (3.16), we nd from direct inspection of the distributions

that

(d(4)

2 ) = 4 , (d(3a)

2

) = 3 , (d(3b)

2

) = 3 , (d(2)

2 ) = 2 .

(3.18)

the singular order depends on the structure of the graph, namely on the number
of derivatives acting on the contracted internal lines of the loop. for a precise
formulation, see below.

the last step in the inductive construction of t2(x, y) consists in subtracting
2(x, y) from r2(x, y), see sec. 3.5. the singular order remains unchanged after

r
distribution splitting: (d2) = (r2) = (t2).

3.4 singular order in quantum gravity

before undertaking the splitting of d2(x, y) according to eq. (3.17), we give the
formula for the singular order of arbitrary n-point distributions in perturbative
quantum gravity.

14

we consider in the n-th order of perturbation theory an arbitrary n-point
n (x1, . . . , xn), appearing in eq. (2.1), as a sum of normally ordered

distribution t g
products of free eld operators multiplied by numerical distributions

t g
n (x1, . . . , xn) =:

h(xkj )

nh

yj=1

nu

yi=1

u(xmi)

n u

yl=1

u(xnl) : tg

n(x1, . . . , xn) .

(3.19)

this t g
n corresponds to a graph g with nh external graviton lines , nu external
ghost lines and nu external anti-ghost lines. the singular order of g then reads

(g)  4  nh  nu  nu  d + n .

(3.20)

here d is the number of derivatives on the external eld operators in (3.19).
the  means that in certain cases the singular order is lowered by peculiar
conditions, e.g. by the equations of motions of the free elds.
the explicit presence of the order of perturbation theory renders the theory
non-normalizable, that is the theory has a weaker predictive power but it is
still well-dened in the sense of uv niteness.

we give some hints of the inductive proof of (3.20) [23], [37]. first of all,

the assumption (3.20) must be veried for n = 1: (cid:0)t h+u
(x)(cid:1) has to be zero
(because of (cid:0)(x)(cid:1) = 0), a result which is correctly given by (3.20) after direct
in the inductive construction of tn from the tms, m  n  1, we must

inspection.

consider tensor products of two distributions

1

tr,1(x1, . . . , xr) ts,2(y1, . . . , ys) ,

(3.21)

with known singular order (tr,1) = 1  4  nh1  nu1  nu1  d1 + r and
(ts,2) = 2  4  nh2  nu2  nu2  d2 + s. according to the inductive
construction, this product has to be normally ordered giving origin to all possible
contraction congurations. we assume that l contractions arise during this
process. taking translation invariance into account the numerical distribution
of the contracted expression is of the form

t1(x1  xr, . . . , xr1  xr)

aj d(+)

0 (xrj  ysj ) t2(y1  ys, . . . , ys1  ys) =

l

yj=1

= t(1, . . . , r1, 1, . . . , s1, ) ,

(3.22)

with j := xjxr, j := yjys,  := xrys, aj = 0, 1, 2 and a =pl

j=1 aj. then,
using the distributional denition of the singular order [23], we may conclude
that

(t) = 1 + 2 + 2l  4 + a .

(3.23)

15

inserting the expressions for 1 and 2 in eq. (3.23), we get

(t)  4  (nh1 + nh2 + nu1 + nu2 + nu1 + nu2  2l)  (d1 + d2  a) + (r + s) .
(3.24)

the rst bracket represents the number nh + nu + nu of external elds after l
contractions, the second bracket gives the number d of derivatives remaining on
these external elds, if the l contractions carry a derivatives. since r + s = n,
eq. (3.20) is proved.

in the usual qft formulation, eq. (3.20) would imply that qg is non-
renormalizable, since (g) increases without bound for higher orders in the
perturbative expansion. this means that there is a proliferation of divergences
and of counterterms to compensate them.

the situation is dierent in causal perturbation theory: we are facing in this
case a non-normalizable theory, i.e. each of its diagrams is nite due to the
causal splitting method, but the number of the free, undetermined and nite
normalization constants in (3.17) increases with n. the question is then to nd
enough physical conditions or requirements to x this increasing normalization
freedom.

3.5 splitting of the d2(x, y)-distribution

we now carry out the splitting of the distribution d2(x, y) in eq. (3.15).
let us consider for example the numerical tensorial distribution d(4)


which has singular order four from eq. (3.18) of from eq. (3.20). because
of the decomposition (3.16), it suces to split the scalar distribution d(p) =
(p2)sgn(p0) with ( d) = 0 and then multiply the so obtained retarded part by
the same tensor p (i)(p)|

 as given by eq. (3.16).

2 (p)|

usually, a special retarded part in eq. (3.17), if it exists is given in momen-

tum space by the dispersion integral

r0(p) =

i

2z 



dt

d(tp)

(t  i0)+1 (1  t + i0)

,

p  v + ;

(3.25)

which is called central splitting solution, because the subtraction point [23]
is the origin. but this formula cannot be used directly in the case of massless
theories, because the integral is divergent. in order to circumvent this deciency,
we shift the original distribution d(x):

dq(x) := ei qx d(x) ,

dq(p) = d(p + q) ,

q2 < 0 ,

(3.26)

so that the central splitting solution r0

q (p) of the shifted distribution exists [37].
we cannot obtain the retarded part of the original distribution simply by
letting q  0, so we take advantage of the normalization ambiguity in the
splitting procedure and consider another retarded part of dq(p), given by rq(p).

16

since two retarded distributions dier only by local terms in conguration space,
we obtain in momentum space for xed q that the dierence reads

rq(p)  r0

q (p) = pq(p) ,

(3.27)

where pq(p) is a q-dependent polynomial in p of degree . then we construct
r(p), a retarded part of the original distribution d(p), from (3.27) by taking the
limit

r(p) = lim
q0

rq(p) = lim

q0(cid:2)r0

q (p) + pq(p)(cid:3) .

(3.28)

here the addition of the q-dependent polynomial pq(p) must be accomplished
in such a way that the limit exists. this corresponds to a nite renormaliza-
tion [37].

using (3.25) with (3.26) in (3.28), we obtain for p  v +, with q  0 in such

a way that p  q  v +, q2 < 0:

(3.30)

(3.31)

being  = 0, we can add the polynomial pq(p) := i

as pointed out at the end of sec. 3.3, the t2(x, y)-distribution is obtained

the normalization freedom present in the splitting d2  r2 + n2, eq. (3.17),

3.6 graviton self-energy tensor from the t2(x, y)-distribution

gathering all the results of the previous sections, eqs. (3.15), (3.16) and (3.34),
we nd that the 2-point distribution that contributes to the graviton self-energy
reads

t2(x, y) =+ : h(x)h (y) : t(4)

2 (x  y)|

+ : h(x),h (y) : t(3a)
+ : h(x)h (y), : t(3b)
+ : h(x),h (y), : t(2)

(3.35)

where the tensorial distributions have in momentum space the structure

2 (p)|
t(i)

 = p (i)(p)|



t(p) ,

i = 4, 3a, 3b, 2 ,

(3.36)

where t(p) is given in eq. (3.34) and the polynomials are those of eq. (3.16).

since divergences in the adiabatic limit of eq. (2.1) do not contribute, we can
obtain from t2(x, y) by partial integration the graviton self-energy contribution

t2(x, y)hse =: h(x)h (y) : i (x  y) .

(3.37)

the main result of our calculation in second order causal perturbation theory
is the graviton self-energy tensor (x  y) which is given by the following
combination of t2(x  y)-distributions

(3.39)

separate calculations for the graviton loop and ghost loop give the following
contributions to the graviton self-energy tensor, respectively:

(p)grav. loop



(p)ghost loop



= h  880,260, +160,170, +110i log(cid:0)(p2  i0)/m 2(cid:1) ,
= h + 224, +52, +2, +8, +8i log(cid:0)(p2  i0)/m 2(cid:1) ;

(3.40)

where we have adopted the convention of writing only the coecients of the
tensor according to the structure given in eq. (3.39) and  := 2/960(2)5.

our result, numerical coecients and logarithmic dependence on p2/m 2,
agrees with the nite part of previous calculations [25], [38] obtained using ad-
hoc regularization schemes. as a consequence, the absence of uv divergences
means that we do not need to add counterterms [14], [15] involving four deriva-
tives to the original hilberteinstein lagrangian in order to obtain uv nite
radiative corrections to the graviton propagator. in our approach, all the ex-
pressions are cuto-free and nite at each stage of the calculation due to the
inductive and causal construction of higher n-point distributions.

4 gravitational slavnovward identity

the gravitational slavnovward identities (swi) [25], [26], [38], [39] are derived
in standard quantum eld theory from the connected green functions. we
construct the 2-point connected green function as

g(p)[2]

 := b df

0 (p)  b df

0 (p) ,

(4.1)

where df
graviton feynman propagators. then the gravitational swi reads

0 (p) = (2)2(p2  i0)1. the two attached lines represent free

p p g(p)[2]

 = 0 .

(4.2)

the swi for qg coupled to photon elds [31] and matter elds [32] are equiv-
alent to the transversality of g(p)[2]
in the case of

 , namely p g(p)[2]

 .

19

self-coupled and ghost-coupled gravitons, the complexity of the gauge structure
implies that only the weaker condition (4.2) can be satised by the graviton
self-energy tensor, which is not transverse.

since the tensorial structure of a general self-energy tensor may be char-
acterized by the ve coecients a, b, c, e, f in the standard representation

(p) = (cid:2)a, b, c, e, f(cid:3) log(cid:0)(p2  i0)/m 2(cid:1) as in eq. (3.39), then the swi

are equivalent to the following relations

a
4  b + e + f = 0 , c + e = 0 .

(4.3)

these relations are satised by the coecients of the self-energy tensor in
eq. (3.39), only if both graviton and ghost loops are taken into account. there-
fore our result satises the swi.

on the other side, if we had chosen another ghost coupling instead of the

one in eq. (2.14), for example t u
then we would have violated the swi, because in this case the new graviton
self-energy tensor through graviton loop would have had the form

2 (cid:0)+ : uh

,(cid:1) [40],

1 (x) =  i

so that the sum of graviton and ghost loop would have not satised the swi in
eq. (4.3).

analogously, if we had disregarded the last two terms in the graviton cou-
pling t h
1 (x), eq. (2.6), being a divergence due to the presence of two equal
derivatives, then we would have violated the swi, too, because in this case we
would have obtained a reduced graviton self-energy tensor through graviton
loop of the form

(p)red.

 = (cid:2)  880, +160,108, +58,62(cid:3) log(cid:0)(p2  i0)/m 2(cid:1) ,

so that the sum of graviton and ghost loop would have not satised the swi in
eq. (4.3). this happens although the dierence between the two tensors can be
written as a divergence

(4.5)

(p)grav. loop



 (p)red.

(x  y) = divergence ,

(4.6)

due to the vanishing of the coecient proportional to pppp and therefore
this dierence should not be physically relevant in the adiabatic limit g  1 of
s(g).

5 fixing of the normalization freedom for the self-

energy tensor

as seen in sec. 3.4, in causal perturbation theory the problem of eliminating
innitely many uv divergent expression is changed into the issue of xing an
increasing number of free undetermined local normalization terms that arise as
a consequence of distribution splitting in each order of perturbation theory.

20

5.1 normalization terms of t2(x, y)

for simplicity, we consider only the normalization freedom in eq. (3.37) in-
stead of eq. (3.35). since the singular order is four, local normalization terms
n2(x, y)  (4)(x  y) of singular order 0, . . . , 4 appear during the process of
distribution splitting and in momentum space they can be written as
n2(x, y)hse =: h(x)h (y) : i n (x, y) (4)(x  y) ,

n (p) =(cid:16) n (0) + n (2) + n (4)(cid:17)(p) ,

(5.1)

where the odd terms are excluded owing to parity. n (p)(i)
 is a polynomial in
p of degree i with i = 0, 2, 4. we assume in addition that only scalar constants
should be considered, because vector-valued or tensor-valued constants may
enter in conict with lorentz covariance. therefore we make the following
ansatz taking also the symmetries of (x  y) into account

n(p)(0)

n(p)(2)

 = h + c1(cid:0) +  (cid:1) + c2 i ,
 = h + c3(cid:0)pp + pp(cid:1) +

+ c4(cid:0)pp + pp + pp + pp(cid:1) +
+ c5 p2(cid:0) +  (cid:1) + c6 p2 i ,

(5.2)

n(p)(4)

 = hc7, c8, c9, c10, c11i .

c1, . . . , c11 are undetermined real numbers. requiring the swi to hold, we can
reduce the normalization freedom to

n (p)(0)

 = 0 ,

n (p)(2)

n (p)(4)

 = h0, c5 + c6,c5, c5, c6i p2 ,
 = hc7, c10 + c11 +

,c10, c10, c11i ;

c7
4

(5.3)

in such a way that only ve undetermined coecients remain to be xed. the
self-energy tensor supplemented by the normalization terms then reads

(p)n

 = (p) + n (p)(2)

 + n (p)(4)

 .

(5.4)

5.2 total graviton propagator and mass and coupling constant

normalization

the task of eliminating the remaining freedom in eq. (5.4) can be accomplished
in our case by considering the total graviton propagator as a sum of the free
graviton feynman propagator [30]

h|t(cid:8)h(x)h (y)(cid:9)|i = i b df

0 (x  y) ,

(5.5)

21

from eq. (2.7) and the contraction (3.1), with an increasing number of self-
energy insertions. in momentum space we therefore obtain the series

d(p)

tot = +b df

since b b
4 tensors, from eq. (5.7) we can derive the form of the inverse of the total
propagator:

h(cid:0) df

tot(cid:1) = b(cid:0) df

0 (p)(cid:1)1  (p)n

(cid:0) d(p)1

= (2)2hb (p2  i0)  (2)2 (p)n

i .

our aim is to impose mass and coupling constant normalization conditions on
the total graviton propagator, therefore we have to invert the expression in (5.8).
for this purpose we express the inverse of the total graviton propagator in the
projection operator basis, introduced in app. 3 and nd

the non-contributing terms vanish between conserved energy-momentum mat-
ter tensors or between physical graviton states [30].

mass normalization (the graviton mass remains zero after the radiative cor-

rection due to the self-energy) requires

= 0 ,

j = 1, 2 ,

(5.12)

and coupling constant normalization (the coupling constant is not changed by
the radiative correction) requires

fj(p2)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)p2=0
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)p2=0

fj(p2)

p2

= 0 ,

j = 1, 2 .

(5.13)

we work out these two conditions for the case j = 1. since f1(p2) has the form
(see eqs. (5.4), (5.9), (5.10), (c.8) and (c.11))

f1(p2) = 2 (2)2 (cid:16)  162 p4 log(cid:0)(p2  i0)/m 2(cid:1) + c5 p2 + c10 p4(cid:17) ,

the two conditions (5.12) and (5.13) are satised, if we set c5 = 0. the analysis
for the case j = 2 is much more involved due to the complexity of eqs. (c.8)
and (c.11), although not conceptually dicult, and it yields the condition c6 =
0. the remaining normalization constants are not determined by eqs. (5.12)
and (5.13), so that we are left with

(5.14)

(p)n

 = (cid:2)  656,208, +162,162, +118(cid:3) log(cid:18)p2  i0

m 2 (cid:19) + n (4)(p) ,

(5.15)

where n (4)(p) is a general swi-invariant polynomial given in eq. (5.3) with
three free normalization constants. in order to simplify the above expression and
to further reduce the normalization freedom, we rescale the constants c7, c10 and
c11 in the following way

c11 = +118 log(m 2/k 2),

c7 = 656 log(m 2/l2),

c10 = 162 log(m 2/n 2) ;
(5.16)

so that, with (h 2)104 := (n 2)81(l2)82/(k 2)59, we obtain

(p)n

 = (cid:20)  656 log(cid:16)p2  i0

(5.17)

with the four arbitrary positive masses l, h, n and k. now, since the splitting
of the mass zero distribution d(p) = (p2)sgn(p0), requires the introduction of

23

a scale invariance breaking mass, it is natural to assume this mass scale to be
unique, say m0, which may correspond in case to the planck mass, so that the
graviton self-energy tensor inclusive normalization freedom now reads

(p)n

 = (cid:20)  656,208, +162,162, +118(cid:21) log(cid:18)p2  i0
0 (cid:19) .

(5.18)

therefore, the whole normalization freedom may be reduced to the single pa-
rameter m0 which remains present in the theory.

6 corrections to the newtonian potential

in the last years a group of papers appeared [41], [42] and [43], based on the
proposal of treating perturbative quantum gravity as a low energy eective quan-
tum theory. in this approach, leading quantum corrections to the newtonian
potential were reliably calculated in the long range, low energy limit.

in this section we will show that causal perturbation theory for quantum
gravity yields the same result for the leading corrections to the newtonian po-
tential for heavy spinless particles described by the scalar eld .

the newtonian potential between two masses m1, m2

v (r) =  g

m1m2

r

(6.1)

can be obtained in the static non-relativistic limit of a single graviton exchange
tree diagram [41], [44] to lowest order in g, calculated from

1 (x) = i :l(1)
t m

m (x) := i


2

: h (x) b t 

m (x) : ,

(6.2)

where the conserved energy-momentum matter tensor reads

m (x) = (x),(x),   l(0)
t 

m (x) ,

(6.3)

and the expansion in power of the coupling constant of the matter lagrangian
density has the form

lm =

2

g(cid:0)g ;;  m2 2(cid:1) =



xi=0

i l(i)

(6.4)

from eq. (6.2), we carry out the inductive construction of the 2-point distri-
bution which describes the    scattering through one-graviton exchange
and nd
0 (x  y)i .

the static non-relativistic limit of the right side of (6.5) yields (6.1) using t 
m 
(2)00m and the fact that the fourier transform of the momentum transfer
p2 reads (4r)1. for a deeper understanding of the connection between s-
matrix and potential, see [45]. inserting one self-energy contribution (5.18) on
the graviton contraction of eq. (6.5), we obtain the order 4 correction

t2(x, y)corr = i

.

(6.6)

(6.7)

only the two last terms in the self-energy tensor will contribute in the following,
because the others vanish when paired with conserved matter energy-momentum
tensors. therefore, even if we had not assumed a unique mass scale (as done at
the end of sec 5.2), the parameters l, h and n in (5.17) would not be physically
observable. from (6.5) and (6.7) we obtain in the static non-relativistic limit
the genuine quantum correction to the newtonian potential (inserting back the
physical constants  and c)

(6.8)

the central piece in the calculation is the distributional fourier transform of

the non-local part of the nal result, being proportional to (3)(x). the relevant

0(cid:1) which yields (2r3)1 and the m0-dependence disappears from

log(cid:0)p2/m 2
length scale appearing in (6.8) is the planck length lp =pg/c3.

our result agrees with the corresponding one in [42], although this represents
only a partial correction to the newtonian potential, because we have taken
into account only the graviton self-energy contribution and not the complete
set of 4 diagrams contributing to these corrections, as, for example, the vertex
correction or the double scattering. therefore we cannot make any statement
on the absolute sign of the correction in eq. (6.8).

7 perturbative gauge invariance to second order

for loop contributions

for the sake of completeness, before proving perturbative gauge invariance to
second order in the loop graph sector, we calculate the 2-point ghost self-energy
distribution.

25

7.1 ghost self-energy

we follow the inductive causal construction described in sec. 3 in order to
construct the ghost self-energy contribution in second order perturbation theory.
starting with the ghost coupling t u
1 (x) given in eq. (2.14), we perform one
graviton and one ghostanti-ghost contraction, eq. (3.1) in order to obtain the
corresponding d2(x, y) distribution. the distribution splitting solution is the
same as in sec. 3.5, namely eq. (3.34) with the singular order given by eq. (3.20)
in sec. 3.4. therefore, after all these steps, we obtain

t2(x, y) =+ : u(x)u(y), : tu,(3a)
+ : u(x),u(y) : tu,(3b)
+ : u(x), u(y), : tu,(2a)

by disregarding divergence terms after partial integration, we can recast (7.1)
into the form

t2(x, y)gse =: u(x)u(y) : i a(x  y)+ : u(x)u(y) : i b(x  y) .

(7.3)

(7.4)

we do not discuss here in detail the normalization freedom of this 2-point dis-
tribution. but an investigation analogous to that of sec. 5.2 for the sum of the
series with an increasing number of ghost self-energy insertions let us assume
that the normalization terms with singular order smaller than four are set equal
to zero, whereas those with singular order four may be absorbed in the scale
invariance breaking mass m .

7.2 perturbative gauge invariance to second order for loop

graphs

the introduction of the q-vertex t 
1/1(x), eq. (2.17), enables us to formulate
perturbative gauge invariance by means of eq. (2.18). we call a theory gauge
invariant to second order, if t2(x, y) satises

dqt2(x, y) = x

t 

2/1(x, y) + y

t 

2/2(x, y) ,

(7.5)

where t

and a normal vertex at y (x).

2/2(x, y)(cid:1) is the two-point renormalized time-ordered prod-

2/1(x, y)(cid:0)t 

since r

2(x, y) is trivially gauge invariant due to (3.2) and (2.17), it suf-
2/2, instead of the

ces to prove (7.5) with the retarded parts r2, r
corresponding t2-distributions.

taking eq. (3.3) and (2.17) into account, we nd that the d2-distribution

is trivially invariant

2/1 and r

the question is whether an equation similar to (7.6) holds for the retarded
parts r2, r
2/2, respectively. in the inductive
causal construction, the splitting of distributions in d2, d
2/2 may give
rise to local normalization terms, if the singular order is positive. we consider
here only loop graphs in second order. therefore, we must show that

since every splitting solution agrees with the original distribution on the
forward light cone v +\{0}, gauge invariance (7.8) can be violated by local terms
with support x = y only. hence, the crucial point is the correct treatment of
the local terms appearing in (7.8).

a careful analysis shows that that the only local terms appearing in (7.8)
and n  loops

are those belonging to the normalization freedom n loops
of the distribution splitting.

let us analyze the dierent terms in (7.8). first of all, the normalization
terms n2(x, y)loops were already discussed in sec. 5.1 and in sec 7.1, below
eq. (7.4). they can be consistently set equal to zero.

the gauge variation of r2(x, y)loops generates no local terms: the eld oper-
ators in the normal products undergo the innitesimal gauge variations (2.11)
and (2.16) and the numerical distributions remain unchanged. taking an exam-

u(x),h(x)h(x), : and in t h+u

(7.16)

here, the n2/1-distributions contain free normalization constants. the terms
2/2(x, y)loops and n 
r
2/2(x, y)loops coming from the second commutator in (7.7)
can be analogously calculated with x  y and an overall sign change. applying

(7.17)

the rst two addends do not contain local terms, because the derivatives act
only on the external elds and the numerical distributions do not contain local
terms by construction. the derivative acting on the numerical distributions in
the last two terms changes them into

2/1(p) = 2

(7.18)

since these terms are proportional to the logarithms, none of them is local. the
local anomaly producing mechanism described in [33] does not apply in the case
of loop graphs. this is a consequence of the presence in loop graphs of prod-
ucts of jordanpauli distributions that yield non-local terms after distribution
splitting.

we turn now to the local terms in x
2/1) = 2, these terms have the general form

( d

2/1(x, y)loops. since ( d

n
2/1(p) = +a1p + a2p + a3p + a4ppp +

+ p2(cid:0)a5p + a6p + a7p(cid:1) ,

n
2/1(p) = +a8 + a9pp + a10p2 ,

(7.19)

where a1, . . . , a10 are unknown parameters. multiplying (7.19) with p leads to
p n
2/1(p) = +a1p2 + (a2 + a3)pp + (a4 + a6 + a7)p2pp + a5p4 ,

p n

2/1(p) = +a8p + (a9 + a10)p2p .

(7.20)

29

therefore, the local terms in (7.8) are those coming from (7.20). in our simplied
example, perturbative gauge invariance then requires

a1 = a2 + a3 = a4 + a6 + a7 = a5 = a8 = a9 + a10 = 0 ,

(7.21)

obviously, these conditions are fullled by choosing a1 = . . . = a10 = 0. one
may convince oneself that the above example can be generalized to all second
order loop graph contributions, because these follow the same pattern, although
much more involved conditions as (7.21) would appear. the important point is
2/2(x, y)loops does not generate local terms. this is
that x
in contrast to the tree graph sector, investigated in [33].

let us add a nal remark:

if we do not x the normalization freedom
n2(x, y)loops of r2(x, y)loops (as done in sec. 5), then the condition of pertur-
bative gauge invariance to second order forces us to choose the normalization
constants ci of n2(x, y)loops and aj of n 

2/1+2(x, y)loops in such a way that

dqn2(x, y)loops = +x

n 

2/1(x, y)loops + y

n 

2/2(x, y)loops

(7.22)

holds. since (7.8) always holds among non-local terms by construction, a trivial
solution ci = aj = 0 i, j always exists. this concludes the proof of perturbative
gauge invariance to second order for loop graphs.

therefore we see that we have to deal with integrals of the type

(cid:2)1, k, kk, kkk, kkkk(cid:3) ,

appendix 2: the i ()(p)...-integrals

for the case of i (+)(p), eq. (a.4), the momenta k and p are restricted to the
space-time regions {k2 = 0, k0 > 0} and {(p  k)2 = 0, p0  k0 > 0}, due

31

to the - and -distributions in the integrand. then p  k and k are time-
like and therefore p is time-like. we choose a lorentz reference frame with

(b.2)

i ()(p) can be calculated analogously and the result is in an arbitrary lorentz
reference frame is

i ()(p) =


2

(p2) (p0) .

(b.3)

computing i ()(p) for p = (p0, 0), p0 > 0, we have a non-vanishing con-
tribution only for  = 0. we obtain for i ()(p)0 an additional factor k0 in the
integrand of (b.2), which is set equal to |k|, because of the distribution (k0|k|)
and nally is set equal to p0/2, because of the distribution (|k|  p0
2 ). this
leads to

i ()(p) =


4

p (p2) (p0) ,

(b.4)

in an arbitrary lorentz reference frame.

for i ()(p), we consider the covariant decomposition

i ()(p) = a()(p2) pp + b ()(p2)  .

(b.5)

it follows from i ()(p) 
eq. (a.4)), that

 = 0 (because of the factor k2(k2) in the integrand of

then

b ()(p2) = p2

a()(p2) .

i ()(p) pp =

a()(p2) p4 .

32

(b.6)

(b.7)

calculating i (+)(p) pp for p = (p0, 0), p0 > 0, through the integral deni-
tion (a.4), an additional factor (p0k0)2 appears in the integrand, therefore we
obtain in an arbitrary lorentz frame

i ()(p) pp =


8

p4 (p2) (p0) .

comparing (b.7) with (b.8) we nd a()(p2) = 

6 (p2) (p0), so that

i ()(p) =



6(cid:16)pp 

p2
4

(cid:17) (p2) (p0) .

for i ()(p), if we calculate i (+)(p)ppp for p = (p0, 0), p0 > 0, we
get a factor (p0k0)3 in the integrand, so that in an arbitrary lorentz frame we
have

(b.8)

(b.9)

(b.10)

(b.11)

i ()(p) ppp =


16

p6 (p2) (p0) .

the covariant decomposition of i ()(p) reads

i ()(p) = c ()(p2) ppp + d()(p2)(cid:16)p  + p  + p (cid:17) .

since i ()(p)
contracting the covariant decomposition of i ()(p) with ppp, we nd

 = 0, we obtain d()(p2) = p2

6 c ()(p2). on the other side,



i ()(p) ppp =

p6
2

c ()(p2) .

(b.12)

comparing (b.12) with (b.10) we conclude that c ()(p2) = 

i ()(p) =



8 (cid:18) + ppp 

p2

8 (p2) (p0) and
6(cid:16)p  + p  + p (cid:17)(cid:19) (p2) (p0) .

(b.13)

we repeat this calculation scheme also for i ()(p) , which has the covari-

ant decomposition

i ()(p) = e()(p2) pppp +f ()(p2)(cid:16)+pp  +pp  +pp +
+ pp  + pp  + pp (cid:17) + g()(p2)(cid:16) +  +   + (cid:17) .

(b.14)

from i ()(p)

 = 0 and i ()(p)



 = 0, we obtain

( f ()(p2) = p2

g()(p2) = p2

8 e()(p2) ,
6 f ()(p2) = p4

48 e()(p2) .

(b.15)

33

computing i (+)(p) pppp, for p = (p0, 0), p0 > 0, we get a factor
(p0k0)4 in the integrand, so that in an arbitrary lorentz frame we have

i ()(p) pppp =


32

p8 (p2) (p0) .

(b.16)

on the other side, contracting the covariant decomposition of i ()(p) with
pppp and using (b.15), we obtain

i ()(p) pppp =

16

p8 e()(p2) .

(b.17)

comparing (b.17) with (b.16), we nd e()(p2) = 
with (b.15) f ()(p2) = p2
that

10 (p2)(p0), that implies
480 (p2)(p0) so

appendix 3: the q(i)(p),-projection operators

the aim of this appendix is to nd a representation basis for rank-4 tensors,
which allows to compute the inverse of the total graviton propagator (5.8) in
sec. 5. let us dene [46]

d :=  

kk
k2

,

e :=

kk
k2

;

(c.1)

with

d d = d ,

d e = 0 ,

e e = e .

(c.2)

then the so-called projection operators are dened by

q(k)(1)

, =

q(k)(2)

, =

q(k)(3)

, =

3(cid:0)dd(cid:1) , q(k)(4)
3(cid:0)ed(cid:1) ;
3(cid:0)de(cid:1) , q(k)(6)

, =

1

1

q(k)(5)

, =

and the so-called transfer operators are dened by

34

(c.3)

(c.4)

with the relations

q(k)(j)

, q(k)(j)

, =(q(k)(j)

0 ,

, ,

if j = 1, 2, 3, 4;

if j = 5, 6.

(c.5)

these and other relations can be easily calculated using (c.2). we consider a
rank-4 tensor in the standard basis as in eq. (3.39) or (3.40) by giving its ve
coecients and disregarding the logarithmic dependence on p2:

t (k) =(cid:2)a, b, c, e, f(cid:3)(k) .

we rescale it by dividing it by k4, so that we can express the obtained rescaled
tensor t (k) in the projector basis given by (c.3) and (c.4):

(c.6)

t (k) =

6

xj=1

xj q(k)(j)

, .

(c.7)

comparing (c.6) with (c.7), we nd the relations between the xj coecients
and the a, . . . , f coecients:

x1 = 2(c + e) ,

x2 = 2e ,

x4 = a + 2b + 4c + 2e + f ,

x3 = 2e + 3f ,

x5 = x6 = 3(b + f ) .

the inverse of t (k) in eq. (c.7) satises

(cid:0) t (k)(cid:1)(cid:0) t (k)1(cid:1) = l ,

being l =(cid:0) +  (cid:1)/2 the unity for rank-4 tensors and it is given

by

(c.8)

(c.9)

(c.10)

(cid:0) t (k)1(cid:1) =(cid:16) + x1
xj=1

=:

+

6

1 q(1) + x1
x3


q(4) 

2 q(2) +
x6


q(5) 

x5


x4


q(3) +

q(6)(cid:17)(k)

yj q(k)(j)

, ,

where  := x3  x4  x5  x6. the proof of eq. (c.10) simply consists in carrying
out the product in (c.9) and using the relations of eq. (c.5). returning back
to the standard representation and multiplying with k4, we obtain

(cid:0)t (k)1(cid:1) =h  2y1 +

(c.11)

using the denitions of the yjs as a functions of the xis from (c.10) and the
inverses of the relations in (c.8), we can then nd the coecients of the inverse

(cid:0) t (k)1(cid:1) in terms of the original coecients a, . . . , f .
