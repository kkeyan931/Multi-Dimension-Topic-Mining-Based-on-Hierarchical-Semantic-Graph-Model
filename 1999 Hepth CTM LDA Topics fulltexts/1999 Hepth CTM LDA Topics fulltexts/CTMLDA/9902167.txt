(2.17) repeating steps two dimensional case ,we obtain following value dirichlet integral d = cd+1 2 za ddxza ddx2 1 |x x|d+1 .

(3.8) (3.9) (3.10) (3.11) (3.12) analogous formulas could obtained hd+1 model well. hyperbolic laplacian h possesses important property mobius invari- ance formulated follows. let x = x mobius transforma- tion hyperbolic space, i.e. let group isometries leave hd+1(or bd+1) invariant then, function f, hf (x) = f (x) (3.13a) well hf (x) = f (x). (3.13b) particular, function f (x) hyperharmonic, function f (x) also hyperharmonic. already mentioned, e.g. eq.(3.7) ,that 14 function zd hyperharmonic. would like use property hyperharmonic laplacian given eq.(3.13b) order obtain general form hyperharmonic function hd+1. using known results mobius transformations hd+1 one easily obtains (with accuracy unimportant constant) f (x) =(cid:20) z |z2 + (x x)2|2(cid:21)d . (3.14) let us check result case two dimensions rst. case d=1 eq.(3.14) obtain (with accuracy constant) eq.(2.17). fact totally coincidental since, view eq.(3.6), hyperbolic laplacian coincides usual one d=1. therefore, write well d+1 dimensions: ph(z, x x) = cd(cid:20) z |z2 + (x x)2|2(cid:21)d , (3.15) compared eq.(2.15). calculate constant cd use known general properties poisson kernels{$9901040$}. particular, normalization requirement cdz ddx(cid:20) z |z2 + x2|2(cid:21)d = 1 (3.16) makes ph act probability density. fact going exploited below. using spherical system coordinates easily obtain: c1 = z0 dx xd1 (x2 + 1)d = 2 ( 2)( 2) (d) , surface area d-dimensional unit sphere , = 2 2 ( 2) . combining result eq.(3.17) obtain, cd = (d) 2 ( 2) . (3.17) (3.18) (3.19) 15 given results above, obtain dirichlet integral using eq.(3.3) rather straightforward, especially, working hd+1 space. case replace eq.s (3.9)-(3.12) following equivalent expressions: dh = ddx xd 0 u nh = x0 u x0 (3.20) (3.21) keeping mind eq.(3.16). remarks obtain d = dcdz ddxz ddx 0(x)0(x) |x x|2d . (3.22) result coincides obtained freedman et al ref{$9806239$}and, later, ref.{$9806239$}. cases methods used noticeably dierent fro ours. discussion presented section 2 clear result rewritten manifestly nonsingular way thus removing need renormalization advocated ref.{$9806239$}. actually, much shall demonstrate shortly below. 4. diusion hyperbolic space boundary cft connection klein-gordon (k-g) schrodinger propagators discussed already feynman long time ago exploited recently work, ref.{$9806239$}. readers convenience,we would like repeat simple arguments. purpose,let us consider equation k-g propagator euclidean space rst. introducing ctitious (or real) time variable auxiliary equation (cid:0) m2(cid:1) g(x, x) = d(x x) . g(x, x; t) =(cid:0) m2(cid:1) g(x, x; t) (4.1) (4.2) supplemented initial condition g(x, x; = 0) = d(x x) 16 (4.3) useful consider connection eq.(4.1). correctness initial condition could easily cheked. indeed, since solution eq.(4.2) known g(x, x; t) =z ddk (2)d exp{ik (x x) t(k2 + m2)} (4.4) one obtains immediately result given eq.(4.3). time, solution eq.(4.2) known then, solution eq.(4.1) known well given simply g(x, x) = z0 dt g(x, x; t) . (4.5) one even better noticing mass term eq.(4.2) simply eliminated using following substitution: g(x, x; t) = em2t g(x, x; t) . thus introduced function g obeys standard diusion equation: g(x, x; t) = g(x, x; t) .

(4.16) eq.(4.16) formal agreement results obtained refs{$9806239$},{$9806239$}. unlike refs{$9806239$},{$9806239$}, analysis results made, would like examine obtained results detail. mentioned already introduction, according maskit, group mobius transforma- tions acts group isometries hyperbolic space hd+1( bd+1) boundary. boundary hyperbolic space acts group conformal motions(transformations) group isometries metric. take account isometric motions hyperbolic space described group mobius trans- formations, eq.s(4.5),(4.6) modied. particular, write, instead eq.(4.5), following result: g(x, x) =x z0 dtem2t g(x, x; t).
