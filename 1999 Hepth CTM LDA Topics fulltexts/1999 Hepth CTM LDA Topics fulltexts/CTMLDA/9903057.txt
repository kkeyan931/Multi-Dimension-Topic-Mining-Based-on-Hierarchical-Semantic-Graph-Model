(2.2) last expression one shall using, since indeed case gauge transformations leave supergravity lagrangians invariant total derivatives. established notation, shall derive explicit commutation relations simplest examples, namely eleven-dimensional supergravity. let us rst note simplifying feature formula (2.2). since interested commutation relations globally-conserved charges only, consider following integral q =z j0dv (10), (2.3) integration performed entire ten-dimensional space. note denition j0 (2.2), rst term nothing canonical momentum multiplied eld variation symmetry transformation. eld content eleven-dimensional supergravity includes 3-form a(3). gauge eld, transforming a(3) = (3) gauge transformations3 (3) 3this version p-form gauge transformation, allows cohomologically nontrivial gauge parameters, discussed particular ref. {$9506126$}. 5 arbitrary closed 3-form, d(3) = 0. straightforward calculation see eleven- dimensional lagrangian l11 = r 1 1 2 f(4) f(4) 1 6 f(4) f(4) a(3) transforms l = d( 1 6 (3) a(3) f(4)) , (2.4) (2.5) implies, according previous discussion, following conserved charges dened: qe((3)) =z (3) ( 1 6 a(3) f(4)) .

(3.4) since transformations thought gauge symmetries, follows eleven-dimensional equations motion massless elds, also low-energy actions extended objects, including massive p-branes, must invariant symmetries. order investigate restrictions imposed non-commutativity, need incorporate couplings (p + 1)-forms world-volume elds. for- tunately, nature couplings well known. example, term world- volume action describing coupling 3-form a(3) minimal form t(3) z a(3), (3.5) t(3) membrane tension. paper, shall use letter exclusively brane tensions. particular t(d), = p + 1 denotes tension p-brane. let us suppose space-time contains compact six-dimensional sub-manifold non-trivial third sixth homology groups, h 3(m ) h 6(m ). simplify discussion, shall take compact sub-manifold six-torus. now, wrap membrane around one homology three-cycles m(3), consider making gauge (3) 6= 0, invariance term (3.5) imposes following restriction value transformations form a(3) = (3), (3) closed 3-form thatrm(3) integral t(3) zm(3) (3) = 2k, (3.6) k arbitrary integer, order quantum eective action invariant. condition implies take closed 3-form gauge parameter, integrate arbitrary homology 3-cycle, result must quantised terms inverse membrane tension. discussion know gauge transformations commute. however, since commutator two symmetry transformations must also 8 symmetry, conclude leave everything invariant. seen commutator two gauge transformations potential a(3) gives rise gauge transformation potential a(6) (3.4). natural think a(6) gauge potential magnetic eld-strength, must couple minimally world-volume ve-brane term t(6) z a(6) . (3.7) a(6) potential independent symmetry; namely, shift arbitrary closed 6-form, (6). argument membrane, provided ve-brane also wrapped certain homology 6-cycle invariance world-volume action implies quantisation condition t(6)zm(6) (6) = 2 , (3.8) arbitrary integer. now, commute two gauge transformations a(3) potential obtain following shift ve-brane world-volume action: = t(6) zm(6) 1 (3) 2 (3), (3.9) 1 (3) 2 (3) parameters rst second gauge transformations re- spectively. torus integral decomposed sum products integrals 3-cycles. already know integrals quantised terms membrane tension (3.6). consistent equation (3.8) t(6) = 1 2 2 (3) . (3.10) stage worthwhile make observation signicantly simplies calculations complicated cases, type iia iib theories ten lower dimensions. one recast commutation relations (3.4) commutators ordinary super lie algebra, introducing generators v v (3) (6) transformations respectively. see commutation relations (3.4) translate super lie algebra  {v, v } = v ,  = 0,  = 0. (3.11) note commutators even odd according whether degrees associated eld strengths odd even. (we shall general, unless severe ambiguity might arise, avoid clumsy language referring commutators anti-commutators generally commutators follows.) refer reader  details algebras. here, wish point complete structure relations among 9 p-brane tensions encoded algebras, directly read commutators generators. non-vanishing commutator, one simply needs replace bracket left product corresponding inverse p-brane tensions, multiplied 2, likewise term right. example, one takes rst commutator (3.11), replaces {v, v } (2/t(3))2 v (2/t(6)) (minus signs must dropped), one arrives relation (3.10). 3.2 type iia brane tensions gauge potentials type iia massless supergravity = 10 a(3), a(2)1, arising dimensional reduction three-form potential = 11, together kaluza- klein vector a1 = 11 = 10.) dual potentials ea(5), ea1 (6) ea(7)1 respectively. elds, together dilaton 8-form dual used construct coset (1).

(3.14) 10 brackets involving v ev s, associated elds coming dimen- sional reduction a(3) dual = 11, give rise t(6) = 1 2 2 (3) , t(5) = 1 2 t(2) t(3) . (3.15) note rst relation (3.15) one found already = 11, hence viewed vertical dimensional reduction result = 11. second relation (3.15) viewed double-dimensional reduction (3.10) = 11. relations (3.14) involve tensions d0-brane d6-brane, associated kaluza-klein vector, hence related (3.10) dimensional reduction. note conservation rule subscripts denote word-volume dimensions various branes appearing tension relations. worth mentioning tensions paper measured using p- branes metrics, e.g. string tension measured string metric; membrane tension measured membrane metric, etc.. metrics, tensions independent moduli. one course also discuss tensions given xed metric. case, tensions would general depend moduli, since metrics related modulus-dependent weyl transformations. straightforward generalise cases, following fact algebra  1 2 h e e+ e(a1 (2) v++a2 (2) v) eb(4) u e(a1 v = e (6)ev++a2 (6)ev) eeee+ e 1 2 eh .

(3.17) thus, set algebraic relations enables us simply read relations among type iib p-brane tensions, namely ns (6) = t(8) = 1 2 1 2 rr (2) t(4) , rr (6) = ns (2) rr (6) , rr (2) = 1 2 1 2 ns (2) t(4) , t(4) = t(0) ns (2) , ns (6) = 1 2 1 2 ns (2) rr (2) t(0) rr (6) , . (3.18) (3.19) note tension relation (3.18) sl(2, ir) covariant, whilst (3.19) not. understandable, since higher-degree gauge potentials form linear representations sl(2, ir), hence associated tensions. tensions t(0) t(8) associated axion dual, transform linearly sl(2, ir), hence (3.19) sl(2, ir) covariant. 4 lower-dimensional brane tensions previous sections, showed brane tension relations m-theory type ii theories derived non-commutativity gauge transformations corresponding supergravities. particular, read directly super lie algebras associated doubled formalisms constructed . super lie algebras lower-dimensions maximal massless supergravities also obtained , straightforward read complete set brane tensions toroidally-reduced theories. 12 4.1 reduction rule brane-tension jade rule begin brief review super lie algebra lower dimensional maximal massless supergravities. obtained dimensional reduction = 11 (0)j, ai (1), a(0)ijk, a(1)ij, a(2)i generators elds given ~h, ei (d2)j, ea(d3)i, eaijk (d2), eaij doubled formalism, dual eld introduced eld (except supergravity type iib supergravity. bosonic sector, additional metric, theory contains dilatons ~ gauge potentials ai a(3). metric), giving ~, eai elds, eei generators form deformed cotangent super lie algebra. precise, let use u denote set generators { ~h, ei j, wi}, associated elds com- ing dimensional reduction metric, u denote generators {v ijk.v ij, v i, v } associated elds coming dimensional reduction three-form potential = 11. superalgebra following form  (d3), eai j, fw i, evijk, evij, evi ev doubled elds.
