abstract

a simple model of spacetime foam, made by n wormholes in a semiclassical

approximation, is taken under examination. we show that the bekenstein-

hawking entropy is here quantized in agreement with the heuristic calcula-

tion of bekenstein.

i. introduction

in the early seventies j. bekenstein [1] and s. hawking [2], basing themselves upon con-

siderations originated from quantum eld theory, changed drastically the concept of a black

hole. beginning with the simple observation that the area of the horizon of the schwarzschild

black hole is a quadratic function of the mass m, they considered an innitesimal increment

(in natural units g = h = c = 1)

dm = dahor

 =

1
4m

.

1

this formally resembles the first law of thermodynamics du = t ds1. this analogy of

the black hole mechanics with thermodynamics appears reinforced by hawkings theorem

on black hole mechanics [3] asserting that the horizon area of an isolated black hole never

decreases in any transformation. thus, if two black holes of area a1 and a2 fuse to form

a black hole of area a1+2, then the theorem asserts that a1+2  a1 + a2. on the basis of
these observation and results, bekenstein made the proposal that a black hole does have an

entropy proportional to the area of its horizon

sbh = const  ahor.

(1)

in particular, in natural units one nds that the proportionality constant is set to 1/4g =

1/4l2

p, so that the entropy becomes

s =

a
4g

=

a
4l2
p

.

for a schwarzschild black hole, for example, one nds the value

s =

4 (2mg)2

4g

= 4m 2g = 4m 2l2
p.

in conventional units instead, we nd for a generic horizon area that

sbh =

1

8gh

ln 2kbc3ahor.

(2)

(3)

(4)

1the best way to see this similarity is with a kerr-newman black hole, where the incremental

formula is

dm  dahor + dq + ~  d~l

and the analogy with the first law

is complete.

du = t ds + p dv

2

this formula is identical (except for the factor of ln 2 which one may think of as a choice of

units of entropy) to the one proposed by hawking [2] based on consistency with the rate of

black hole radiation. the appearance of h is ... a reection of the fact that the entropy is

... a count of states of the system [1]. following bekensteins proposal on the quantization

of the area for nonextremal black holes we have

an = l2

p (n + )

 > 1

n = 1, 2, . . .

many attempts to recover the area spectrum have been done, see refs. [4,5] for a review. note

that the appearance of a discrete spectrum is not so trivial. indeed there are other theories,

based on spherically symmetric metrics in a mini-superspace approach, whose mass spectrum

is continuous. recently a model made by n coherent wormholes, based on wheelers ideas

of a foamy spacetime [8], has been considered [12]. in that paper, hereafter referred as i,

we have computed the energy density of gravitational uctuations reproducing the same

behavior conjectured by wheeler during the sixties on dimensional grounds. in this paper

we wish to apply the ideas of i to a generic area. the result is a quantization process whose

quanta can be identied with wormholes of planckian size. implications on the black hole

entropy are taken under consideration. the rest of the paper is structured as follows, in

section ii we briey recall the results reported in ref. [12], in section iii we compute the

area spectrum. we summarize and conclude in section iv.

ii. spacetime foam: the model

in the one-wormhole approximation we have used an eternal black hole, to describe a

complete manifold m, composed of two wedges m+ and m located in the right and left
sectors of a kruskal diagram. the spatial slices  represent einstein-rosen bridges with
wormhole topology s2  r1. also the hypersurface  is divided in two parts + and  by
a bifurcation two-surface s0. we begin with the line element

ds2 = n 2 (r) dt2 +

both satised by the schwarzschild and flat metric respectively. the supermetric is gijkl =
2 (gikgjl + gilgjk  gijgkl) and r(3) denotes the scalar curvature of the surface . by using
the expression of the trace

k =

h(cid:16)hn(cid:17),

,

(8)

with the normal to the boundaries dened continuously along  as n = (hyy)

y . the

value of k depends on the function r,y, where we have assumed that the function r,y is

positive for s+ and negative for s. we obtain at either boundary that

k = 2r,y

r

.

(9)

the trace associated with the subtraction term is taken to be k0 = 2/r for b+ and k0 = 2/r
for b. then the quasilocal energy with subtraction terms included is

equasilocal = l2

p (e+  e) = l2

ph(r [1  |r,y |])y=y+  (r [1  |r,y |])y=yi .

(10)

note that the total quasilocal energy is zero for boundary conditions symmetric with respect

to the bifurcation surface s0 and this is the necessary condition to obtain instability with

respect to the at space. in this sector satisfy the constraint equations (7). here we consider

perturbations at  of the type

gij = gij + hij,

4

(11)

where gij is the spatial part of the schwarzschild and flat background in a wkb approxi-

mation. in this framework we have computed the quantity

e (m) = d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h schw.  h f lat(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) e

h|i

+ h|hquasilocal| i

h|i

,

(12)

by means of a variational approach, where the wkb functionals are substituted with trial

wave functionals. this quantity is the natural extension to the volume term of the subtrac-

tion procedure for boundary terms and it is interpreted as the casimir energy related to

vacuum uctuations. by restricting our attention to the graviton sector of the hamiltonian

approximated to second order, hereafter referred as h|2, we dene

e|2 = d(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h|2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) e

h|i

,

where

 = hhiji = n exp(

after having functionally integrated h|2, we get

(17)

where v is the volume of the system and r0 is related to the minimum radius compatible with

the wormhole throat. we know that the classical minimum is achieved when r0 = 2mg.

however, it is likely that quantum processes come into play at short distances, where the

wormhole throat is dened, introducing a quantum radius r0 > 2mg. we now compute

the minimum of e (m), after having rescaled the variable m to a scale variable x =

3mg/ (r3

02). thus

v

we obtain two values for x: x1 = 0, i.e. at space and x2 = e 1

nevertheless, there exists another part of the spectrum which has to be considered: the

discrete spectrum containing one mode. this gives the energy an imaginary contribution,

namely we are discovered an unstable mode [11,13]. let us briey recall, how this appears.

the eigenvalue equation

(2)a

i haj = hij

(19)

can be studied with the regge-wheeler method. the perturbations can be divided in odd

and even components. the appearance of the unstable mode is governed by the gravitational

eld component heven

(22)

where  is the eigenvalue, y is the proper distance from the throat in dimensionless form. if

we choose h (, y) = exp (y) as a trial function we numerically obtain  = .701626. in
terms of the energy square we have

e2 = . 175 41/ (mg)2

(23)

to be compared with the value e2 = . 19/ (mg)2 of ref. [11]. nevertheless, when we
compute the eigenvalue as a function of the distance y, we discover that in the limit y  0,

its minimum is at  =(cid:16) 9

it is evident that there exists a critical radius where  turns from negative to positive. this

critical value is located at c = 1. 113 4 to be compared with the value c = 1.445 obtained by

b. allen in [17]. what is the relation with the large number of wormholes? as mentioned

in i, when the number of wormholes grows, to keep the coherency assumption valid, the

space available for every single wormhole has to be reduced to avoid overlapping of the wave

functions. if we x the initial boundary at r, then in presence of nw wormholes, it will
be reduced to r/nw. this means that boundary conditions are not xed at innity, but
at a certain nite radius and the adm mass term is substituted by the quasilocal energy

expression under the condition of having symmetry with respect to each bifurcation surface.

7

the eect on the unstable mode is clear: as nw grows, the boundary radius reduces more

and more until it will reach the critical value c below which no negative mode will appear

corresponding to a critical wormholes number nwc. to this purpose, suppose to consider

i, with
nw wormholes and assume that there exists a covering of  such that  =
i  j =  when i 6= j. each i has the topology s2  r1 with boundaries i with
respect to each bifurcation surface. on each surface i, quasilocal energy gives

nwsi=1

ei quasilocal =

p zsi+

d2x(cid:16)k  k0(cid:17) 

2
l2

p zsi

d2x(cid:16)k  k0(cid:17) .

(26)

thus if we apply the same procedure of the single case on each wormhole, we obtain

ei quasilocal = l2

p (ei+  ei) = l2

p (r [1  |r,y |])y=yi+  l2

p (r [1  |r,y |])y=yi

.

(27)

note that the total quasilocal energy is zero for boundary conditions symmetric with respect

to each bifurcation surface s0,i. we are interested in a large number of wormholes, each of

them contributing with a term of the type (12). if the wormholes number is nw, we obtain

(semiclassically, i.e., without self-interactions)2

thus the total energy for the collection is

|

h nw

tot = h 1 + h 2 + . . . + h nw

.

(28)

{z

|2 = nwh|2.

the same happens for the trial wave functional which is the product of nw t.w.f.. thus

tot = 1  2  . . . . . . nw = n exp nw(

where we have rescaled the uctuations h = g  g in such a way to absorb nw/l2
propagator k (x, x)iakl is the same one for the one wormhole case. thus, repeating the

p. the

where we have dened the usual scale variable x = 3mg/ (r3

iii. area spectrum and entropy

a very important application of the model presented in the previous section is the area

quantization. the area is measured by the quantity

a (s0) =zs0

d2x.

(31)

 is the two-dimensional determinant coming from the induced metric ab on the boundary

s0. we would like to evaluate the mean value of the area

a (s0) = df(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) a(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) fe

hf|fi

= df(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) drs0 d2x(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) fe

hf|fi

,

computed on

|fi = 1  2  . . . . . . nw.

(32)

(33)

if we use the fact that ab = ab + ab, where ab is such that rs0 d2x = 4r2 and r is

the radius of s0, we obtain to the lowest level3 in the expansion of ab that

3for lowest level in the expansion of ab, we mean

9

a (s0) = df(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) a(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) fe

hf|fi

= 4r2.

(35)

suppose to consider the mean value of the area a computed on a given macroscopic xed

radius r. on the basis of our foam model, we obtain a =

i 6= j. thus

nsi=1

ai, with ai  aj =  when

a = 4r2 =

ai =

nxi=1

4r2
i .

nxi=1

when ri  lp, ai  alp and

a = nalp = n4l2
p.

(36)

(37)

thus the macroscopic area is represented by n microscopic areas of the planckian size:

in this sense we will claim that the area is quantized. one immediately observes that n

is such that n  nwc, where nwc is the critical wormholes number above which we have
the stability of our foam model. at this point we can apply the same reasoning of refs.

[18,19,21] to arrive at the bekenstein-hawking relation between entropy and area

s =

a
4l2
p

.

(38)

note that there is a ln 2 numerical factor missing to complete the equality, between this

model and the models described in refs. [18,19,21]. this is principally due to the fact that

there is no a degeneracy factor related to the statistics. here the wormholes are the same.

of course the introduction of a degeneracy factor does not alter the main result and the

ab = exp t r lnab = exp t r

ln (ab + ab)

= exp t r

2(cid:20)ln ab(cid:18)1 +

(34)

10

only eect will be that of dividing the spacetime covering into equivalence classes with a

representative for each class. in our case, we deduce that the entropy is

s = n.

(39)

moreover this seems also to agree with the conclusions of bekenstein ( [4] and refs. therein),

apart the degeneracy factor that in our model seems to be related to the odd or even

permutation of any single wormhole wavefunction4. we can use eq. (37) to compute the

entropy also for other geometries, for example, the de sitter geometry. since we know that

for this metric the bekenstein-hawking relation (38) still holds, we write

that is5

s =

(40)

(41)

thus the cosmological constant  is quantized in terms of lp. note that when the worm-

holes number n is quite large,   0. we could try to see what is the rate of change
between an early universe value of the cosmological constant and the value that we observe.

in inationary models of the early universe is assumed to have undergone an early phase with
a large eective   (1010  1011gev )2 for gut era ination, or   (1016  1018gev )2 for

4remark. entropy is quantized as a consequence of (37) and not as a direct application of the

denition s = p pn ln pn.

5a relation relating  and g, via an integer n appeared also in ref. [20]. nevertheless in ref.

[20], n represents the number of scalar elds and the bound from above and below

|2gn /3  2| 

3

comes into play, instead of the equality (41) .

11

planck era ination. a subsequent phase transition would then produce a region of space-
time with   (1042gev )2, i.e. the space in which we now live. for gut era ination, we
have (we are looking only at the order of magnitude)

1020  1022gev 2 =

1
n

1038gev 2  n = 1016  1018,

while for planck era ination we have

1032  1036gev 2 =

1
n

1038gev 2  n = 106  102,

(42)

(43)

to be compared with the value of (1042gev )2 which gives a wormholes number of the order

of

1084gev 2 =

1
n

1038gev 2  n = 10122.

(44)

this very huge number is obtained by averaging the area on a cosmological scale by means

of planck scale wormholes. thus it seems quite reasonable that with the growing of the

cosmological radius, we obtain a growing wormholes number covering the horizon area.

iv. conclusions

in this paper we have applied the model presented in i to the entropy computation assum-

ing the validity of the bekenstein-hawking relation. in this picture the area is quantized in

the sense that spacetime can be lled by a given integer number of disjoint non-interacting

wormholes. this result is in agreement (apart a numerical factor) with the quantized area

proposed heuristically by bekenstein and also with the loop quantum gravity predictions of

refs. [18,19], apart the degeneracy factor missing, principally due to the fact that we have

an ideal boltzmann gas of wormholes. a similar result appeared in ref. [21]. neverthe-

less, in ref. [21], spacetime was assumed ab initio built up of cells of planckian size, while

it seems that, in order to have stability, spacetime needs to be covered by n wormholes of

the planckian size. nevertheless, even if in this letter also the meaning of the cosmological

constant seems to be related to a pure gravitational eect enforcing the idea that  is not

12

fundamental but is the eect of quantum uctuations of the pure gravitational eld, giving

therefore strong indications of a foamy spacetime, we are not in presence of a model which

can cure the well known problems of the still absent theory of quantum gravity. the main

reason resides in a cuto dependent model. even if one can argue that a planck length

cuto is quite natural, it is not clear how to compute such a value from rst principles, even

if it is likely that a relation between this formulation of quantum gravity based on a large

number of coherent wormholes and the well accepted string theory could exist.
