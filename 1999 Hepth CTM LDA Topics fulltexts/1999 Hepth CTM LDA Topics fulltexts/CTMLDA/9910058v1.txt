abstract

a manifestly gauge invariant continuous renormalization group ow equation is constructed

for pure su (n ) gauge theory. the formulation makes sense without gauge xing and

manifestly gauge invariant calculations may thus be carried out. the ow equation is

naturally expressed in terms of uctuating wilson loops, with the eective action appearing

as an integral over a gas of wilson loops. at innite n , the eective action collapses to a

path integral over the trajectory of a single particle describing one wilson loop. we show

that further regularization of these ow equations is needed. (this is introduced in part

ii.)

1. introduction and motivation

our main motivation for the present work is to obtain an elegant gauge invariant wilso-

nian renormalization group [1] framework formulated directly in the continuum, as a rst

step for non-perturbative analytic approximation methods. quite generally such methods
can prove powerful,1 and of course there is a clear need for a better non-perturbative un-

derstanding of gauge theory. however, several other issues are naturally resolved in the

process of solving this rst step.

in recent years there has been substantial progress in solving supersymmetric gauge

theories [7]. these methods involve computing a low energy gauge invariant wilsonian

eective action, which however, because of the lack of a suitable framework, is never

precisely dened. whilst we concentrate here solely on pure yang-mills theory, we see no

essential diculty in generalising the ow equations to include fermions and scalars and

indeed spacetime supersymmetry. it is clear then that our framework can underpin these

ideas [7][8].

our framework is here formulated for an su (n ) gauge group, and is a concise exposi-

tion of that reported in ref. [3](see also [9]). all of the ideas presented here adapt to other
gauge groups, with minor alterations.2

whilst it is an interesting academic issue to establish the existence of a gauge invariant

wilsonian eective action and corresponding ow equation, its use would ultimately be

limited without powerful non-perturbative approximation schemes. fortunately, a beau-

tiful approximation scheme lies waiting to be developed: namely the large n limit where

the gauge group is e.g. su (n ) [10][14]. typically, the starting point for these methods

has been dyson-schwinger equations for wilson loops derived at the bare level. progress

has been hampered by the lack of corresponding renormalised equations [13]. one of the

most attractive features of the exact renormalization group (rg) is the fact that solutions

may readily be expressed directly in renormalised terms [4]. thus combining these two

approaches removes one obstacle to solving the large n limit.

we will see that the large n limit of the wilson ow equations however results in an

intriguing picture which is (somehow) dual to the dyson-schwinger approach. for example,

in this picture the gauge elds appear not integrated over but take the role of background

eld spectators while the wilson loop, which is xed (but selectable) in the dyson-

schwinger approach, is now dynamical and integrated over. the analogue of migdals

observation[11] that the large n limit may be expressed in terms of the expectation value of
a single wilson loop3 is here reected in the fact that the continuum limit of the wilsonian

eective action, which at nite n may be written in terms of (innite) sums of integrals

of products of wilson loops, at innite n reduces to a single integral over congurations

of just one wilson loop. the ow equations reduce to equations determining the path

integral measure for this wilson loop. operators, which may be viewed as perturbations

of this action, also take the form of averages over wilson loop congurations. these are

nothing but the continuum counterparts of the interpolating operators used in lattice

gauge theory to create propagating glueball states and study their wavefunctions. this

picture is thus ideally suited to describing both the gauge elds and the low energy (e.g.

bound state) degrees of freedom.

let us emphasise that the solution of the large n limit in this way, collapses the

quantum eld theory to a form of single particle quantum mechanics. by far the most

exciting possibility raised by this viewpoint, in our opinion, is that it may nally open the

door to the solution of large n gauge theory. (quite apart from the obvious theoretical

attractions, the large n limit is expected to be accurate in practical situations e.g. 10%

accuracy is expected for many quantities in su (3) yang-mills [15].) in the present paper,

this picture lies just below the surface. we will leave to future work a fuller investigation of

this description, and the simplications at large n that ensue. nevertheless, this picture

was central in guiding us to the construction of a consistent ow equation.

a particular problem that has to be faced in this direction, is that a gauge invariant

eective cuto function, similarly to gauge invariant higher derivative regularisation, is not

sucient to regulate all ultra-violet divergences. one loop divergences slip through [16].

we cure this problem in the sequel by adapting the equations to a novel spontaneously

broken supersymmetric gauge theory, in which the heavy partners play the role of pauli-

villars regulator elds [9]. in this way all the attractive aspects of the present framework

are preserved while curing this one remaining problem.

the most attractive feature is surely the property that gauge invariance is explic-

itly maintained at all stages (no gauge xing or brst ghosts are required), resulting in

elegant and highly constrained relations. one important consequence is that there is no

3 due to correlators of wilson loops decoupling in the planar limit [10]

2

wavefunction renormalization. the only quantity requiring renormalization is the coupling

constant!

actually, honest non-perturbative approaches to non-abelian gauge theory that pro-

ceed by gauge xing, must face up to the challenging problem of gribov copies [17]. here,

these problems are entirely avoided.

in previous exact rg approaches to gauge theory the authors have gauge xed, and also

allowed the eective cuto to break the gauge invariance. they then seek to recover it in

the limit that the cuto is removed [18][19]. as we have indicated, the present development

follows a very dierent route. in sec. 2, we review polchinskis form of wilsons exact rg

molding it into a form suitable for such a generalisation. in sec. 3, we then generalise this to

u (1) gauge elds as a stepping stone to the full non-abelian generalisation. we introduce

here several important properties of these generalisations, namely that gauge invariance

may be exactly preserved, that solutions may be found without gauge xing, and that non-

trivial generalisations exist which leave the partition function invariant and continue to

correspond to integrating out. in sec. 4, we introduce the full non-abelian generalisation,

demonstrate that the gauge eld cannot renormalize, introduce the concept of a wine,

coincident line identities, the denition of the coupling g, and discuss some qualitative

criteria satised by the formulation namely, quasilocality, ultralocality, and integrating

out. in sec. 5, we develop the gauge eld expansion in terms of traces and products of

traces, introducing the eective vertices, and demonstrate that the large n limit of the

eective action has only a single trace. in sec. 6, we introduce and develop the wilson

loop representation which we deliberately leave this late in the paper to emphasise that the

formalism stands separately from this interpretation, although we believe this enables a

powerful intuition. the large n limit of the eective action is then seen to correspond to a

form of quantum mechanics for a single particle and the ow equation is seen to determine

the measure over the uctuating wilson loops. in sec. 7, we use this interpretation to

rapidly develop some of the general properties of the vertices: the trivial ward identities

expressing exact preservation of gauge invariance, charge conjugation invariance, lorentz

invariance, and the coincident line identities. sec. 8 sets out the perturbative expansion,

demonstrating that the wilson loop diagrams are also feynman diagrams. in this section,

we solve for the classical two, three and four point functions, along the way showing

explicitly how manifestly gauge invariant perturbative computations may be performed,

and explaining how the resulting formulae are highly constrained by gauge invariance

considerations, in fact to the underlying wilson loop picture. we then explain how the

3

 function is determined and give the relevant one-loop contribution. we analyse this

and show how this is at least quadratically divergent (in four dimensions) whatever the

choice of cuto function. this causes subtleties with gauge invariance due to momentum

integral surface terms that do not vanish. we also show that the coecients of some of

the divergences are not even polynomial in the momenta. appendix a provides a large

momentum analysis of the vertices, necessary to draw these conclusions. along the way

we demonstrate that this bad ultraviolet behaviour is a necessary consequence of the exact

preservation of gauge invariance (and briey discuss the colinear and small momentum

regimes which are even more highly constrained by gauge invariance). nevertheless we

will see in part ii [9], that these ultraviolet problems can be cured, as already indicated

above.

2. the polchinski equation

we work in d euclidean dimensions. for two functions f (x) and g(y) and a momentum

space kernel w (p2/2), where  is the eective cuto, we introduce the shorthand:

fw g :=zz ddx ddy f (x) wxy g(y)
wxy z ddp
(2)d w (p2/2) eip.(xy)

,

.

where

(2.2)

here c(p2/2) > 0 is a smooth, i.e. innitely dierentiable, ultra-violet cuto prole,
and prime denotes dierentiation with respect to its argument. the cuto, which mod-
ies propagators 1/p2 to c/p2, satises c(0) = 1 so that low energies are unaltered, and
c(p2/2)  0 as p2/2   suciently fast that all feynman diagrams are ultraviolet
regulated. we may write the regularised kinetic term (i.e. the gaussian xed point) as

s = 1

2 c1 .

(2.3)

in terms of the total eective action s[] = s + sint, and 1 := s  2 s, the exact rg
equation reads

(up to a vacuum energy term that was discarded in (2.2) [20]). the ow in s may be

shown directly to correspond to integrating out higher energy modes [1][4][21][24], while

leaving the partition function z =rd es

invariant. (for our purposes we may absorb
all source terms into s as spacetime dependent couplings.) indeed the invariance of z
follows from (2.4) because

3. a ow equation for abelian gauge elds

we motivate the form of our non-abelian exact rg by rst developing an abelian
version. for u (1) gauge theory, we write the covariant derivative as d =   iga,
where g is the coupling. clearly if we replace the gaussian xed point solution (2.3) by

the gauge invariant

(3.1)

(3.2)

is also gauge invariant, while still preserving the invariance of the partition function under

the ow (by (2.5), replacing  by a). furthermore, by utilising ref.[25] this may readily
be shown to correspond directly to integrating out higher energy modes [3].

note that no gauge xing has taken place, nor is it necessary for nding solutions to

(3.2). this exact preservation of gauge invariance will have the important consequence,

when generalised to non-abelian gauge theory, that d cannot renormalise.
it is thus
convenient to redene d =   ia, by changing variables a 7 a/g, since a will
then not suer wavefunction renormalisation and only the coupling g will renormalise. if
we also redene s 7 s/g2 (i.e. keep denition (3.1) for the new elds), (3.2) becomes

where  := g/, and g := g2s  2 s. of course it is still the case that  
is a total functional derivative (after addition of a vacuum energy term, the jacobian for
a 7 a/g).

5

this rg equation is not yet in a convenient form for generalisation to non-abelian

gauge theory, because the new  term on the left of (3.3) is not manifestly gauge invari-

ant.4 we now come to a central observation of the paper. there are many other ow

equations which have the property that  

 es

is a total functional derivative, and thus

leave

z =z da es

(3.4)

invariant. furthermore a subset also correspond to integrating out higher energy modes,

even though direct derivations [1][21][24] may no longer be possible (cf. ref.[3] and the

next section). in particular, here we can simply drop this annoying  term!

pure u (1) gauge theory is not a good testing ground for these assertions because
the only continuum solution is s = s/g2 with  = 0, i.e. the gaussian xed point of

free photons. it was thus an instructive exercise for us to perform a similar analysis for

(2.4) and 4 theory, and demonstrate explicitly that universal terms, e.g. the one-loop 
function (d = 4), are unchanged after mapping  7 /1/4 and dropping the  term,
and indeed to check that this is true even on more baroque alterations. since the non-

abelian gauge theory exact rg corresponds to our most important such example, we will

not report further on these exercises.

to summarise, for u (1) gauge theory we may write the exact rg as

s = 

g = g2s  2 s ,

where

and s is given by (3.1). this leaves the partition function (3.4) invariant:

es(cid:19) .

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

in the next section, we explain why it also corresponds to integrating out higher energy

modes [3].

4 gauge invariance follows only once we assume s is gauge invariant, i.e. here  (s/a) = 0.

in the non-abelian case gauge invariance would not hold separately for each order in h.

4. a ow equation for non-abelian gauge elds

we work with the gauge group su (n ). (these ideas may easily be extended to general

gauge groups). we are interested in formulating an exact rg for the gauge eld a(x) =
aa
(x) a, the connection for the covariant derivative d =   ia. the generators
( a)i
j are taken to be hermitian, in the fundamental representation, and orthonormalised
as tr( a b) = 1

2 ab.

gauge transformations are of the form a = d   := [d, ] where (x) = a(x) a.
let us stress that exact preservation of this relationship immediately implies that a
cannot run (and thus has the nave unit scaling dimension): if the gauge eld were to suer
multiplicative wavefunction renormalization by z, we would have to write a 7 a/z,
destroying the gauge invariance since then a = (z1)+d. this argument fails in
the gauge xed theory only because  is replaced by a ghost eld in the brs transformation
[26] leading to pointwise products of elds ( a ghost) which are themselves ill dened
without further renormalization.

the eld strength is f := i[d, d]. it will be useful to dene



a(x)

:= 2 a 
aa


.

(4.1)

this transforms homogeneously, and its properties can be understood as follows. to avoid
the momentarily extraneous aspects  the x dependence and  index  let aa be an adjoint
representation and write analogously, /a = 2 a/aa. if s(a) is a function of a such

that

s(a) = tr a y

,

then by the completeness relation for su (n ), we eectively isolate y :

s
a

= y 

1
n

tr y

.

this leads, up to o(1/n ), to sowing

given a kernel w (p2/2), we construct

jy, the wine [3], a functional of the
kernel which is its gauge covariantization, incorporating parallel transport of the tensor
i(x) are two n  n representations of the gauge group
representation. thus, if vj

(4.6)

where without loss of generality we may insist that {w} satises u{w}v  v{w}u. the
index ow, or parallel transport, is illustrated in g. 1.

.

l

the m = 0 case should be interpreted as follows: it has vertices w1n,(x1,    , xn; ; x, y)
and the second product of gauge elds is replaced by k
l. the n = 0 case is dened

similarly. we will write the m = 0 vertices more compactly as

w1n (x1,    , xn; x, y)  w1n,(x1,    , xn; ; x, y)

.

(4.8)

in addition, the m = n = 0 vertex is just the original kernel (2.1b), i.e.

this expansion is illustrated in g. 2.

up to the requirement that it is still smooth in momentum space (i.e. that all vertices

are taylor expandable to all orders in momenta) [3] and some symmetry constraints (cf.
below (4.6) and later), the covariantization {w} is of our choosing. however, for simplicity
we further impose some coincident line identities (described in sec.5) which in particular

result in

vj
k(y) = j

kg(y) y

=

u{w}v = (tru)w g

,

(4.10)

as represented in g. 3.

for example, we could simply include in (2.1a) two straight wilson lines

u{w}v =zz ddx ddy wxy tr u(x)[cxy]v(y)1[cxy]

,

(4.11)

cxy being the straight line between x and y. (later we will consider more general curves.
recall that the wilson line is the path ordered exponential:

(4.12)

,

where we have parametrized cxy by z( ),   [0, 1], z(0) = x, z(1) = y.) another choice
can be obtained by utilising the momentum representation, to write

u{w}v = trz ddx u(x) w (d2/2)  v(x)

9

(4.13)

(where, as above (4.1), the covariant derivatives act by commutation). we will not need

to specify the choice in this paper.

we covariantize (3.1) to

s = 1

2 f{c1}f

.

(4.14)

(note that gauge invariance forces us to include not just the gaussian xed point but also

the interactions.) our (insuciently regularised) exact rg is then just the covariantization

of (3.5) [3]:






s = 

1

g

+

a{c}

g

.

(4.15)

just as in (2.4), the rst term on the rhs is the classical term, yielding the tree cor-

rections, while the second, quantum, term, generates the loop corrections. note that we
have assumed the same functional relationship for the covariantization of c1 and c [e.g.

as in (4.13)]. this is convenient but not necessary. the ow preserves the corresponding
partition function (3.4), just as before, because (3.7) holds  on replacing c with {c}.

the coupling, g, which appears in (4.15) through (3.6), is dened by s via its unique

derivative-squared term:

s =

1

2g2 trz ddx f 2

 + o(3)

(4.16)

(discarding the vacuum energy). note that s must have a derivative expansion to all orders,

because  must play the role of an infrared cuto in its vertices [23][4], as explained below.

one of the great attractions of gauge theory is that in four dimensions, there are no
relevant or marginal operators5 we can put in by hand. in this case, g is the only coupling,

and furthermore the self-similarity of the continuum solution [4] ensures that the only

explicit dimensionful parameter is  whose appearance is then determined by dimensions.

thus in d = 4 dimensions we can write for the continuum solution

s =

1

2g2 trz d4x f 2

 + o(3/)

(4.17)

(again discarding the vacuum energy).

in preparation for the large n limit we write g 7 g/n , s 7 n s. this has no eect

on (3.6), (4.16) or (4.17), while (4.15) becomes

10

as we will show explicitly in the next section, the quantum term survives the large n limit

only in those terms in which each loop correction is accompanied by tr1 = n [3].

we nish this section by discussing some important qualitative criteria satised by

(4.15) or (4.18). recall that it is a fundamental requirement of the renormalization group

that the kadano blocking transformation [1] should aect variables only in a localised

patch; long range interactions should appear only after innitely many steps (analogously
here   0).

on the one hand, obviously, we must therefore require that each rg step is free from
infrared singularities,6 equivalently here that the ow equation must have an all-orders

taylor expansion in small external momenta. we call this the requirement of quasilocality

[3]. this implies that the same is true of s, as we claimed above, providing only that

we ensure that -integration constants are also chosen quasilocal. as we will conrm
explicitly, quasilocality then follows from the smoothness of the wine-vertices and s. after

integrating down to some intermediate scale , the long range interactions are hidden in

s in this quasilocality (since the modes that are integrated out are infrared cuto by ).

on the other hand, we want to ensure that unintended fundamental physics or even

non-local non-physics is not also hidden in this quasilocality. we call this the requirement
of ultralocality. for momenta much larger than the infrared cuto , the typical  1/p2
behaviour of fundamental propagating modes does show up in the vertices of s. therefore

the requirement of ultralocality corresponds to ensuring that there are no spurious inverse

powers of momenta in this asymptotic expansion [3], in particular that we do not introduce

any propagator-like terms into (4.14).

(actually, despite the intuition, it is not clear to us whether this requirement is really

[3], shows that it is not in fact
needed. a more careful study than that reported in ref.
possible to generate an arbitrary quasilocal s0 from a quasilocal s, rather there are some
restrictions on additions to s0. it may be that the physics is still correct but hidden in

a change of variables. to denitively answer these issues requires generalising the recipe

for extracting correlators and thus scattering matrix elements from the eective action

[23][4].)

finally, we can see indirectly that (4.15) must still correspond to integrating out, once

this ow equation is completely regularised, as follows.

in this case, by denition all

6 actually this statement is strictly true only for a smooth (i.e. innitely dierentiable) cuto.
more subtle cases, e.g. sharp cuto [27], will not be considered here.

11

momentum integrals are bounded. but since  appears as the ultraviolet cuto scale in

these integrals, this means that contributions from momenta larger than some scale q must
vanish in the limit q/  . thus we see that as   0, the remaining contribution
from any xed range of non-vanishing momentum scales, disappears. since the partition

function (3.4) is unchanged under the ow, the contributions from a given xed momentum

scale must still be in there somewhere, and the only other place they can be, is to already

be encoded in the eective action  i.e. the modes have been integrated out. (strictly it is

the partition function (3.4) that we must show is completely regularised, and not just the

ow equation. it is hard to see here however, how this property could separately fail.) a

more intuitive, but incomplete, requirement for integrating out to be taking place (which

is also satised) was discussed in ref. [3].

5. gauge eld expansion and the large n limit

the wilsonian eective action s, being gauge invariant, has an expansion in traces and

products of traces:

s =

+

nz ddx1    ddxn s1n (x1,    , xn) tr a1 (x1)    an (xn)
xn=2
xm,n=2

.

this is represented graphically in g. 4 (cf. g. 2. note that the combinatorics in the

gures are those of feynman rules: i.e. each diagram stands for the sum over all ways of

assigning the gauge elds to the points, whilst respecting the order in the traces.)

the momentum space vertices are written as

s1n (p1,    , pn) (2)d(

s1n (x1,    , xn)

(5.2)

where all momenta are taken pointing into the vertex, and similarly for the vertices in
(4.7). s has an expansion in only single trace vertices s1n (x1,    , xn), as follows from

cp  c(p2/2) and the transverse combination  (p) := p2  pp , in the three-point
vertex we add the two cyclic permutations of (p, q , r), and in the four-point vertex the
three cyclic permutations of (p, q, r, s). note that, since cp and all the wine-vertices
are smooth, all the s-vertices have the same property.

concentrating on the single trace terms of s (or s) we see from (4.7), (5.1), and (4.4),
that {c}s/a opens up the trace by removing one a and replacing it with the ends of
the lines of parallel transport in g. 1. in the classical term of (4.18) the leftmost /a
does the same with another (copy of the) action, while in the quantum term, the leftmost

/a opens up the same trace again and attaches the other ends of the parallel transport
lines, splitting the trace in two, as in (4.5). diagrammatically, the single trace terms of s,

under a small change in , thus induce the contributions in g. 5.

strictly speaking we should include in the quantum term of (4.18), the contributions

as in g. 6 where the leftmost functional derivative attacks the parallel transport lines

the functional derivative away from the wine [3]. in fact these terms will vanish once the

pauli-villars contributions are included [9].

as   , s is given by just the rst term in (4.17), and thus is a single trace in this
limit. we see from g. 5 that those terms with a product of two traces are down by factors

of 1/n . in the large n limit the only quantum terms that survive are the split-open traces

where all the gauge elds lie in only one of the two new traces, as in g. 7. thus in the

large n limit, the single trace property is preserved by the ow and the eective action at

any  contains only single trace terms.

however, whilst it is true that the large n limit of the eective action is a single trace,

the limit of the ow equation itself may be more subtle: two-trace terms with just two gauge

elds in one of the traces are also formally down by a factor of 1/n , but the attachment

of a eld-free wine to these two gauge elds in a higher order quantum correction, will

14

2

fig.7. in the large n limit, the surviving terms have all gauge elds living on one of the

two traces, the no-gauge-elds trace contributing tr1 = n .

then yield a further factor of 1/n (for the quantum correction) and a factor of n 2 for two
eld-free traces, thus contributing in principle a nite amount in the n   limit. to
one loop this does not happen because two-trace terms with just two elds in one of the

traces, vanish at tree level for symmetry reasons, as we prove in sec. 8. we leave to the

future, the question of whether or not this more subtle large n limit of the ow equations

takes place at higher loop order.

6. wilson loop representation

the wilson loop representation was central to our exposition in [3], and indeed plays

a powerful role in our own thinking, but we have intentionally avoided introducing it until

this point to emphasise that the ow equations and their properties hold entirely separately

from this representation, even though we nd that these properties show up most clearly

through this representation.

we have already mentioned, cf. (4.11), that we could covariantize the kernel by using
straight wilson lines. more generally, we could use curves cxy, although to ensure lorentz
invariance these would have to be averaged over their orientations. the most general

covariantization, preserving the fact that in (4.7) the gauge elds appear in just two strings,

is then given by (path) integrals and/or sums over all the congurations of these two curves,

with a normalised measure of our own choosing [up to the lorentz covariance requirement

above, the smoothness requirement above (4.10), and exchange symmetry below (4.6)].

however, we simplify this by traversing back along a coincident wilson line, i.e. back from

y to x along the same curve:

u{w}v =zz ddx ddyz dcxy tr u(x)[cxy]v(y)1[cxy]

.

(6.1)

the measure (hidden in the denition of dcxy) does not of course depend on the
parametrization of the path, and is normalised by

z dcxy 1 = wxy

,

15

(6.2)

as follows from (4.9). (as a trivial example, in the case of (4.11), it has support only on
the straight line cxy where the measure collapses to multiplication by wxy.) clearly (6.1)
and (6.2) imply the identity (4.10) we introduced earlier.

similarly the most general form for the action is in terms of path integrals over wilson
loops [c] = tr [cxx] (c being a closed contour, x some arbitrary point on it, and cxx
being the marked contour starting and nishing at x). the most general single trace term

is obtained from an integral over all congurations of a single wilson loop, the most general

two-trace terms from two wilson loops and so on. thus (5.1) may be represented as

s =z dc [c] +

1

2!z d[c1, c2] [c1] [c2] +   

,

and s may be written

s =z d c [ c]

(6.3)

(6.4)

[by (3.1)]. while the measure d c is of our choosing, the measures dc, d[c1, c2], etc. , are
determined by the ow equations.

by virtue of the fact that

[cxy] = izcxy

dz [cxz] a(z) [czy]

,

where cxz (czy) is the part of cxy before (after) z, all our previous gures still hold but as
snapshots of the wilson loops and/or lines. we only have to remember that wherever the
wine attaches, it is integrated around the curve by ir dz. as a result, our previous

gures, e.g. g. 5, are no longer just hieroglyphics indicating the form of the resulting

traces  but come alive as uctuating wilson loops (or lines) i.e. representatives of the
appropriate measures (e.g. dc).

from the previous section, in the large n limit, (6.3) collapses from a gas of wilson

loops to just a single path integral over one wilson loop. we can write this explicitly as a

path integral over a single particle circulating in a loop:

s = p z dx es[x]+h dx.a ,

where we have parametrized the closed curve c by x( ), and the (parametrization in-
dependent) path integral measure dx es is determined by the ow equation. note that
g. 5 indicates that this measure is rather unusual compared to that e.g. of a free particle,

16

but nevertheless we see that gauge theory in the large n limit, is equivalent to a form of

quantum mechanics for a single particle!

combining (6.3) and (5.2), yields wilson loop expressions for the vertices, e.g. the

single trace vertices are given as [3]

as we will show now in some small examples, these wilson loop (line) representations

allow one easily to extract many general properties of the solutions.

7. symmetries

the gauge invariance (trivial ward) identities follow by applying a =   i[a, ]

to (5.1) and (4.7), or more simply by direct integration in (6.5) and (6.6):

p1
1 s1n (p1,    , pn) = s2n (p1+p2, p3,    , pn)s2n (p2,    , pn1, pn+p1). (7.1)

17

note that it is clear from (5.1) or (6.5) that these vertices are cyclically symmetric:

s1n (p1,    , pn) = s2n1 (p2,    , pn, p1)

.

diagrammatically, (7.1) corresponds to a push forward minus a pull back of the point

concerned to the end points of the relevant integration domain in (6.5), as in g. 9.

fig.9. graphical representation of gauge invariance identities.

of course, these same properties hold for s1n (p1,    , pn), and separately for each
string in s1n,1m(p1,    , pn; q1,    , qm), the two-trace vertices of (5.1). (in addition

s1n,1m (p1,    , pn; q1,    , qm) = s1m,1n (q1,    , qm; p1,    , pn)

without loss of generality, from (5.1) or (6.3).) for the wine vertices we have the analogous

identites except that outer momenta can reach the end of line:

p1
1 w1n,1m(p1,    , pn; q1,    , qm; r, s) =

(7.2)

w2n,1m(p1 +p2, p3,    , pn; q1,    , qm; r, s)
w2n,1m(p2,    , pn; q1,    , qm; r+p1, s)

,

with similar identities for contraction with pn

n , q1

1 and qm

m , as is clear from g. 8.

charge conjugation (c) invariance follows from the symmetry a  at

 , equivalently

from reversal of the direction of all wilson loops (lines), thus

s1n (p1,    , pn) = ()nsn1 (pn,    , p1)

,

(similarly s) and combining c invariance with the exchange identity,

w1n,1m(p1,    , pn; q1,    , qm; r, s) = w1m,1n (q1,    , qm; p1,    , pn; s, r)

18

(which one easily sees by rotating g. 8 or from (4.6) under u  v), gives

w1n,1m(p1,    , pn; q1,    , qm; r, s) =

()n+m wn1,m1 (pn,    , p1; qm,    , q1; s, r)

.

lorentz invariance implies that changing the sign of all the momentum arguments in
the vertices (of s, s or w ) just changes the sign of those with an odd number of momentum
arguments and leaves alone those with an even number.

finally the coincident line identities readily follow from (6.6) by changing the direction

of the y integration:

w1n,1m(p1,    , pn; q1,    , qm; r, s) = ()m xinterleaves

w1m+n (k1,    , km+n; r, s)

,

n
m+n in which the ps remain ordered

where we have used (4.8), and the sum runs over all interleaves of the sequences p1
and qm
with respect to each other, and similarly the q s remain in reverse order.

i.e. combined sequences k1

some useful examples are:

s(p, q, r) is antisymmetric under exchange of any pair in (p, q, r)

,

w(p; q, r) = w(p; r, q)

,

pw(p; q, r) = wq  wr

,

s(p, q, r, s) = s(q, p, s, r)

,

w (p, q; r, s) = w(q, p; s, r)

,

w;1m (; q1,    , qm; r, s) = w1m(q1,    , qm; s, r)

,

w, (p; q; r, s) = w (p, q; r, s)  w(q, p; r, s)

.

(7.4)

8. perturbative expansion

although we will be especially interested in four dimensions, we keep d 6= 4 here since
it will be helpful to access this via the limit d  4 [3]. it will also be helpful to write
(4.18) as






s = a0[s, g2s  2 s] + a1[g2s  2 s]

,

(8.1)

where we have used (3.6) and written the classical term as the bilinear functional a0
and the quantum term as the linear functional a1. at the classical level, we see from

 the subscripts indicate the order of h, i.e. the number of loops involved.

19

(4.16) and (8.1), that s  1/g2. substituting this in the quantum term of (8.1), we see
that the one loop correction  g0, and so on. thus by iteration, s has the weak coupling
expansion

s =

1
g2 s0 + s1 + g2s2 +   

.

(8.2)

this is of course the form expected by the usual graphical considerations [after performing
a 7 a/g as above (3.3)]. substituting this expansion in (8.1) and recalling that g will
run at the quantum level, we see that the  function must also take the standard form

 := 

g


= 1g3 + 2g5 +   

.

(8.3)

we will see below how the i are determined. by (4.16), g2 has dimension 4  d. the
i thus carry dimensions (d  4)i and (as we will conrm) are not universal except when
d = 4. from (8.2) and (8.3), we obtain the loopwise expansion of (8.1):














s0 = a0[s0, s0  2 s]
s1 = 21s0  2a0[s0  s, s1] + a1[s0  2 s]
s2 = 22s0  2a0[s0  s, s2]  a0[s1, s1] + a1[s1]

,

(8.4)

(8.5)

(8.6)

etc. we mention in passing that by considering linear perturbations s 7 s + o, we easily
obtain the ow equations for the integrated operator o, and its weak coupling expansion.
thus from (8.1),




o = 2a0[g2s  s, o] + g2a1[o]

.

(8.7)

from (8.2), we expand o = 1
(8.1), or directly from (8.4)  (8.6):

g2o0 + o1 + g2o2 +    giving, either from (8.3), (8.2) and








o0 = 2a0[s0  s, o0]

o1 = 21o0  2a0[s0  s, o1]  2a0[s1, o0] + a1[o0]

o2 = 22o0  2a0[s0  s, o2]  2a0[s2, o0]  2a0[s1, o1] + a1[o1]

(8.8)

(8.9)

, (8.10)

etc.

8.1. feynman diagrammatics and the classical vertices

our diagrams, as in g. 5, play one nal role: expanded as in g. 2, they yield feyn-

man diagrams which may be translated directly into the corresponding equations for the

vertices. the translation rule is just that we must place the points and their associated

momenta in all places on composite wilson loops, whilst preserving the cyclic order. we

then read o the appropriate wine and action vertices (applying momentum conserva-

tion and including momentum integrals if appropriate), contract the lorentz indices of
points joined by wines and, from (4.18), multiply the whole by 1/22. in the following we
compute in this way the rst few classical vertices7 s0

here, the empty circle corresponds to s0, not s as in g. 5, and we have noted that since

actions one-point vertices vanish (by tr a = 0 but see also [3]), we must have at least

one blob per lobe. thus

s0

(8.12)

from (8.2), we require f (0) = 1 so as to be consistent with (4.16) in the g  0 limit.
substituting (5.3), we readily nd the unique solution to be f = c, and thus

 (p) = s (p)

(8.13)

for the three-point vertex:

(8.14)

here it should be understood that in the curly brackets we replace  with 1, and to the
whole expression we add the two cyclic permutations of (p, q, r). in principle the top
limit would be 0, the bare cuto scale, but since the integrands have taylor expansions
in momenta/1, the continuum limit 0   trivially exists (as expected at the classical
level). the integration constant is a term independent of , which by dimensions and

locality (quasi or ultra, cf. sec. 4) must be linear in the momenta. by gauge invariance

it has to be the unique covariantization of  (see below), i.e. the three-point vertex in
1
in fact, this conclusion follows directly by comparing the    limit of

.

(4.17) with (8.14).

using (7.1) and (7.2), one may readily check the gauge invariance of (8.14): contracting

the rhs of (8.14) with p, we obtain

(8.11) and (8.13), the integrand is a total derivative integrating to boundary terms

. the top limit cancels the  terms in (8.15) if and only if the in-



h s(r)  s(q)i
(r)  s0

gives s0

tegration constant in (8.14) is a gauge covariantization of  (p), while the bottom limit

(q) evaluated at , as required. in fact, this check is clear essentially

diagrammatically, using g. 9, g. 11, and g. 10 as follows. on the rhs of g. 11, we sum

the results of pushing forward and pulling back each point in turn (i.e. summing over the

cyclic orderings of the momentum p). the cancelling terms mentioned above, correspond

to terms that meet at a corner where the wine joins s  push-forwards to the end of a

wine cancelling pull-backs to this point in s, and vice versa  while the remaining terms

represent the integrand in (8.15). these appear as the two-point diagrams of g. 10, with

each point in turn replaced by the pushforward and pullback arrows of g. 9.

the simplication that the ow depends only on already known terms persists to all

higher point classical vertices (and therefore also to all orders in h, a.k.a. g): since we need

at least one blob per lobe, the ow of a classical n-point vertex cannot depend on a higher-

point vertex, and thus these equations are closed. furthermore, when one lobe corresponds

to an n-point s0-vertex, the other corresponds to the two-point vertex (8.13). since for

n > 2, there are two such terms in a0[s0, s0] but only one in a0[s0, s], these contributions

cancel in (8.4). thus the ow of s0

1n
or s, and may be immediately integrated.

for n > 2, depends only on lower-point vertices

in a similar way, we compute the classical gauge invariant continuum four-point vertex.

(8.16)

where cycles stands for the three cyclic permutations of (p, q, r, s). we see that, as
predicted in sect.5, (8.13), (8.14) and (8.16) are smooth in momenta.

whilst (8.16) may look complicated, the expression is actually completely determined

from the top term by gauge invariance and cyclicity: indeed, the top term is sucient to

identify the two composite wilson loops in (8.4), and from the graphical arguments below

(8.15), gauge invariance then holds only if all the other terms appear with their correct

coecients, since these correspond to all cyclic order preserving positions of the points

on the underlying composite wilson loop, and only then do all the corner cancellations

correctly take place. similarly all the other (e.g. higher-loop and/or higher-point) s-

vertices follow from just one or two of their individual terms. in fact, since (4.14) is also
a composite wilson loop (6.4) [3], these same comments apply to the s-vertices (5.3).

at nite n , classical vertices with more than one trace do exist. however, simply by

tr a = 0, there can be no such vertices with three or less points. the four-point vertex
s0
,(p, q; r, s) actually also vanishes. its ow is shown diagrammatically in g. 13, where

once again we have simplied with (8.13).

these contributions vanish on adding the cyclic permutations p  q or r  s, by
the antisymmetry of the three-point vertices [as in (7.4)]. therefore s0
,(p, q; r, s) is
independent of . since by dimensions it is dimensionless, by gauge invariance orthogonal
to p, q, r and s, and by locality polynomial in these momenta, the only solution is

vanishes for any number n of gauge elds inside the second trace.

(this remark is of

importance for the large n limit of the ow equation, as already mentioned in sect. 5.)

the rst non-vanishing double-trace vertex appears at the six-point level, with three gauge

elds inside each trace.

incidentally, we can now use (8.8) to conrm the statement above (4.17), that apart

from trrddx f 2
 there are no relevant or marginal operators here (as expected). we see
by expanding (8.8) into n-point vertices and using (8.13), that the term omin in o0[a],
with the lowest number min of gauge elds, cannot have any  dependence. thus the
(eigen)dimension of o (which about the gaussian xed point g = 0, is that of o0) is
simply do = min + mp, where mp is the power of momentum in omin (which must be a
positive integer by quasilocality). taking into account the requirement of gauge invariance

we have that apart from the min = mp = 0 unit operator (a.k.a. vacuum energy) which
 which by (4.16) amounts

we here always ignore, and the min = mp = 2 part of trrddx f 2
to a change of g, there are no operators with do  4.

8.2. the  function

as usual, the  function is determined through a renormalisation condition, which in

our case is (4.16). using this we have

s (p) = 2/g2  (p) + o(p3)

,

(8.17)

and thus by (8.13),

s (p) =

1
g2 s0

 (p) + o(p3)

.

by (8.2), this implies that the o(p2) component of all the higher loop contributions sn
 (p),
must vanish. this greatly simplies the o(p2) part of the two-point vertex ow in (8.5) 

(8.6), in particular reducing them to algebraic equations. thus we see that

a1[s0  2 s] (p) = 41 (p) + o(p3)

,

(8.18)

where a1[s0  2 s] (p) is the two-point vertex in a1[s0  2 s]. this xes 1. similarly, at
n  2 loops, the n are determined by the requirement that a1[sn1](p) = 4n (p)+
o(p3). and non-perturbatively from (8.1) and (8.2),

a1[g2s  2 s] (p) = 

4
g3 (g)(p) + o(p3)

.

25

8.3. one loop

we can use the above classical vertices to compute the one-loop two-point vertex and
thus 1. the relevant diagrams for the lhs of (8.18)8 are displayed in g. 14, where the
wilson loop stands for  = s0  2 s.

(8.19)

clearly by the lorentz symmetry of the integral, the addition of the cyclic permutation
p  p just multiplies the result by two. untying the large-n change of variables
g 7 g/n , we see that 1 in principle has n dependence in two terms, one proportional

to n , as expected, and one unexpected contribution proportional to 1/n .9 actually this

1/n term vanishes independently of the choice of covariantization. this follows since
by using (5.3), lorentz invariance (k  k,    etc. ) and the last (coincident
line) identity in (7.4), one may show that under the k-integral s (k, p, k, p) 
2 s(k, p, p, k), while expanding the s0 four-point vertex by (8.16), and again using
these symmetries, one may show that the same identity holds for s0

 (k, p, k, p).

the problem is that the k integral is divergent. while propagator-like terms have been
uv improved to  c/p2, the interactions e.g. (5.3), (8.14) and (8.16), are worse by c1, this
latter behaviour being forced by gauge invariance (7.1), as we show in appendix a [3]. with
a power-law regulator, i.e. c(x)  1/xr, r > 0, for large x  k2/2, the integrand  1/k2
for large k. this behaviour may be established by analysing the individual contributions,

using the large k behaviours given in appendix a. it is most readily seen to hold in the
a1[ s] (p) contributions: the n-point s vertices with two large momenta  k behave as
c1
k k4n, while the m-point c vertices with  k entering in at their ends [as in (8.19)]
behave as c

kkm. for the two-point one-loop vertex, we have m + n = 4.

on taking into account the two powers of external momenta that must fall out by gauge

invariance, as in (8.18), one might expect that the integrands behaviour is improved to
 1/k4, however this is false. firstly, this power counting argument relies on dimensional
reasoning which fails to work so simply here because it does not constrain functions of
the dimensionless ratios momentum/. secondly there is no separation of tree-level
and loop contributions. these points are illustrated below. finally, gauge non-invariant

terms may also arise, from contributions that cancel, but only after a shift in k [3]. these

contributions thus integrate to surface terms in (8.19), which are guaranteed to vanish only

if the integral over the original parts converge.

to demonstrate this eect we compute the gauge dependent part of (8.19). the mo-

mentum routing chosen in g. 14 and (8.19) corresponds to taking k to be the momentum

of the left-most functional derivative in the quantum term of (4.18) and is natural if we

wish to further regularise the integral in a way that corresponds to modifying the mea-

sure over a(k) modes whilst preserving the fact that (4.18) leaves the partition function
(3.4) invariant, and thus preserve the expected universality of 1. however the reader can
check that k-shifted dierences always arise, but as diering expressions, no matter how

the terms in (8.19) are routed. (this reects the conict between specifying momenta,

and the action of gauge invariance [18][3].) we assume that (8.19) is further regularised so
that invariance under k  k is preserved, and collect terms using the observation above
(7.3). then using (7.1), (7.2), and (8.13), we readily obtain

using (5.3) and expanding the rhs as a power series in p, one obtains integrals that may

be done exactly and thus, using (8.18),

particular for the power-law c, we have

and the leading divergences actually cancel. if in addition the correction to (8.22) is o(1/x)

or better (as will be the case here), the non-invariant terms in (8.21) vanish for all d < 4,
and thus also for d  4. note that at d = 4, we could still get a nite o(p0) term from
the subleading correction to (8.22), violating gauge invariance. this illustrates the need to

dene these integrals carefully. as we will see below however, power-law c is not enough

to regularise the gauge-invariant divergences.

consider g. 15. this is one of several  1/k2 contributions to the rst term of (8.19)
(from expanding the rst term in g. 12, using g. 11) which, since the two blobs appear
on two-point s vertices, are already orthogonal to p. another example is given in ref.[3].

these outer two-point vertices do not feel the loop-momentum k, nor indeed do the

outer wines, and in this sense are really tree corrections to the one-loop term. indeed,

however many points appear on these outer parts the divergence is still quadratic in d =

(the non-polynomial part arises from the c

cs are functions of 2.) it is easy to verify either diagrammatically or directly from (8.14),
(8.16) and (8.19), that no other contribution has the same non-polynomial dependence,

and thus this divergence remains uncancelled. using appendix a, we isolated exactly the

complete coecients (polynomial and non-polynomial) of the leading (and sub-leading)

divergences, and veried that there are many further uncancelled divergences.

in the

interest of compactness we do not present the details.

28

9. conclusions

we briey recapitulate some of the main points.

we formulate a ow equation for the eective action s of a non-abelian gauge eld
a, the connection for the covariant derivative d =   ia, which leaves the partition
function invariant under the ow.

gauge invariance is manifest at all stages; the transverse bilinear term in s need not

be inverted in the equation or its solution (which is here investigated perturbatively).

ghosts and gauge xing are not required. the challenging problem of gribov copies is

thus avoided.

(n.b. contrary to popular folklore, it is not necessary to implement gauge xing or

other explicit reduction of variables merely to factor out the innite volume of the gauge

group, which in any case only amounts to one of many harmless divergent vacuum energy

contributions.)

the placing of the coupling constant g outside the connection, together with the exact

preservation of gauge invariance, means that a is protected from wavefunction renormal-
ization. only g renormalizes. we show how the corresponding  function is determined

through the appropriate renormalization condition on s.

the global group invariance ensures that everything can be expanded in products of

traces. we show that in the large n limit, s collapses to a single trace. the limit of the

ow equation itself may be more subtle.

the general covariantization entering into the equation can be conveniently expressed

as an integral over congurations of wilson lines. in a similar way the solution s may

be expressed as an integral over a gas of wilson loops. in this way the ow equation

may be reformulated entirely in terms of manipulations on wilson loops. the equations

then determine the measure over these uctuating wilson loops. in the large n limit, s

becomes an integral over the congurations of just one wilson loop, i.e. a path integral

for a single particle circulating in a loop.

this wilson loop picture may also be interpreted as feynman diagrams and thus pro-

vides an intuitive and elegant way to derive the perturbative solution for s. we derive the

ward identities and discuss the interpretation of the various symmetries (charge conju-

gation, lorentz and gauge invariance) in this picture. we derive the two, three and four

point vertices at the classical level, and the one-loop two-point vertex.

we explicitly conrm that these solutions are gauge invariant. however, we show that

subtleties with momentum-integral surface terms appear at one loop (and higher) as a

29

consequence of the divergent nature the momentum integrals in this framework. this

in turn is related to the large momentum behaviour of the vertices, whose lower bound

is xed by the exact preservation of gauge invariance (as we show in appendix a). we

demonstrate that some of the divergences that thus appear at one loop are non-polynomial

in momenta and remain uncancelled in the complete solution in this framework. the

further regularisation that is required is developed in ref.[9].

the ow equation and its solution s enjoy the important property of quasilocality,

namely that they can be expanded in a taylor series in their (external) momentum argu-

ments to all orders. equivalently for s, that it has a derivative expansion to all orders.

the completely regularised ow equation will correspond to integrating out high energy

modes because  will then act properly as an eective ultraviolet cuto. the preservation

of the partition function then ensures that those high energy modes that are eliminated,

get incorporated into s. the solution to the ow equation thus yields for the rst time, a

precise continuum prescription for a gauge invariant wilsonian eective action.

appendix a. large and small momenta

any vertex has a transverse part whose form depends on the choice of covariantization
{ } (and the choice of ow equation in the case of s), and a universal longitudinal part
whose form is dictated by gauge invariance. consider the one-point wine w(p; k, k p).
(recall that we label the one-point vertex by the kernel it covariantizes. since, by trans-

lation invariance, all vertices are accompanied by momentum conserving delta functions,

all relations must be derived for the case where the momentum arguments sum to zero.)

by gauge invariance (7.1), (7.2), we have (7.4):

pw(p; k, k  p) = wk+p  wk

.

(a.1)

30

in the case that p and k are colinear, this may be solved immediately for w(p; k, k  p).

more generally, for small p, using wk  w (k2/2), we have

w(p; k, k  p) =

w 
k
2 (2k + p) + 2

w 
4 k.p k + o(p2)
k

,

(a.2)

where we have noted that any term perpendicular to p may be added while leaving (a.1)
unchanged, but by lorentz invariance this has tensor structure  (p)k.

(a.1) also constrains the ultraviolet behaviour of w(p; k, k  p). for example, for
large k it is constrained to be at least as bad as the rhs. explicitly, consider choices of
wk where the scale is set by k for large momenta, and thus w (x)/w (x)  1/x for large
x, i.e. where wk goes as a power or log for large k (say w (x)  xw). (a.2) then typically
holds also for k >> p, with o(p2) replaced by o(p2k2w3), since for this to be violated
requires including non-minimal eld strength terms10 in { }.

many similar relations can be derived for colinear, small and large momenta for the
other vertices, including s and s vertices. in any case we have that the ultraviolet be-
haviour for large k is at best w(p; k, k  p)  wk/k.
it is then easy to see that
w1n,1m(p1,    , pn; q1,    , qm; k, kpi pipj qj) must have ultraviolet behaviour
at least as bad as wk/km+n: by the gauge relations (7.1), (7.2), each m + n vertex is
related to a dierence of two (m + n 1) vertices, whose arguments only dier in momenta
small with respect to k. for choices wk where k sets the scale (as above), this dierence
falls by just one extra power of k compared to each (m + n 1) vertex, and thus the m + n
vertex cannot fall faster than an (m + n  1 vertex)/k. the italicized statement above
then follows immediately, by iteration.

recall that the two-point vertices for the actions are xed as in (8.13) and (5.3), and
therefore s (k) = s (k)  c1
k k2. by the same argument as above, using (7.1), we have
that the n-point vertices s1n (p1,    , pn) where any two momenta pi are large of order
k, behave at best as c1
k k4n. the same bound holds for s. these relations are sucient
for the demonstration that the one-loop contribution is not regularized (in sect. 8), and

show that the lack of complete regularization follows from the gauge invariance.

in fact, while the s vertices achieve the lower bound c1

k k4n (as sketched below), s
does not, as is already clear from the ow of the classical four-point function shown in

g. 12. we see there that if the two large momenta are next to each other, they can enter
and leave a three point lobe, thus actually s(k, k  p  q, p, q)  c1
k k.
10 balanced by 1/2: these are the terms which are transverse to p

31

this eect would not appear if the gauge invariant ow was for one-particle irreducible

vertices (a legendre formulation) but the lack of separation between tree-level and loop

contributions (see also the end of sect. 8) seems to be a necessary consequence of the exact

preservation of gauge invariance. to see this, recall that all the terms in g. 12 have to

appear as shown, by gauge invariance, given the rst two terms. but attaching a wine to

make a one-loop contribution out of this gauge invariant four-point vertex produces both

diagrams that are one-particle reducible and one-particle irreducible.

the cases where one or both large momenta enter the side of a wine are also more

involved. we rewrite (a.1) as

kw(k; p, k  p) = wp  wk+p

.

(a.3)

now the asymptotic behaviour for large k depends on whether wk grows or falls for large
k. the growing case corresponds to c1
k  k2r and does still follow the simple rules above,
if r is large enough: we have that at best c1
k /k. arguments as above
then rapidly establish that an m + n point vertex from {c1} with two large momenta  k
in any position behaves at best as  c1
k /km+n providing r  m + n. and once again, this
bound is saturated if there are no non-minimal terms in { }. in the cases where r < m + n,
the bound established below for the falling cases may dominate.

 (k; p, k  p)  c1

best c

(k; p, k  p)  c

the falling case corresponds to wk = c

k and in this case we read from (a.3), that at
p/k. note that the coecient of a divergence arising from this
need not be polynomial in p. (see similar remarks in sect. 8.) this 1/k behaviour is true
of any m + n vertex where the k can reach the top end of the line, for example:

kc

, (r, k; q; p, k p q r) = c

, (r; q; p, p q r) c

,(r + k; q; p, k p q r)

.

the rst term on the rhs  k0 sets the bound, since the second term can go as 
1/k [as may be established by writing out the gauge relation kc
, (k; q; p, k  p  q)].
again by iteration, the general rule for the case where one large momentum k enters via
the side of {c} is that the vertex goes at best as 1/kv+1 where v is the number points
(gauge elds) separating the two large momenta. once more, this is saturated by minimal

covariantizations.

the case where both large momenta enter {c} via the side can be treated similarly, with
the conclusion that the vertex again goes at best as 1/kv+1 where v is the number points

separating the two large momenta. however in this case even minimal covariantizations

32

do not necessarily reach this bound. for (4.13), the case where the two momenta are next
to each other on one side of the wine leads to a o(k0) contribution11   (k)/k2 as will
be established explicitly in ref. [9]. consequently (4.13) actually behaves as 1/kv, for two
large momenta  k entering the side and separated by v points.

as indicated above if r < m + n, in particular if m + n r > v + 1 (m + n r > v), then
the bounds  1/kv+1 ( 1/kv) for one (two) large side momenta are the limiting ones for
{c1} also. with the above bounds for wine vertices, one can check explicitly from (5.3),
that the s vertices saturate their own bounds. all the asymptotic formulae given in this
[9], where we will also derive the
appendix will be conrmed explicitly for (4.13) in ref.
