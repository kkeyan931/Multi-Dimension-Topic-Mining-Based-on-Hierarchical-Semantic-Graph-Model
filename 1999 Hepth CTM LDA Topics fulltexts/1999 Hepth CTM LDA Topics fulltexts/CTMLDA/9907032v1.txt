abstract

a generalized second law in string cosmology accounts for geometric and

quantum entropy in addition to ordinary sources of entropy. the proposed

generalized second law forbids singular string cosmologies, under certain con-

ditions, and forces a graceful exit transition from dilaton-driven ination by

bounding curvature and dilaton kinetic energy.

string theory is a consistent theory of quantum gravity, with the power to describe high

curvature regions of space-time [1], and as such we could expect it to teach us about the

fate of cosmological singularities, with the expectation that singularities are smoothed and

turned into brief epochs of high curvature. however, many attempts to seduce an answer out

of string theory regarding cosmological singularities have failed so far, even after the wave of

recent new developments and results [2]. the reason is probably that most recent technical

advancements in string theory rely heavily on supersymmetry, but generic time dependent

solutions break all supersymmetries, and therefore known methods are less powerful when

applied to cosmology. we propose to turn to general thermodynamical considerations in the

quest to understand cosmological singularities, as rst suggested by bekenstein [3] in the

context of einsteins general relativity. we propose that entropy considerations, in particular

accounting for geometric and quantum entropy, accompanied by a generalized second law

(gsl) demanding that entropy never decreases, be added to supplement string theory, and

show that under certain conditions gsl forbids cosmological singularities. the proposed

gsl is dierent from gsl for black holes [4], but the idea that in addition to normal entropy

other sources of entropy have to be included has some similarities.

the idea that entropy and thermodynamics can play a role in cosmology has been stressed

recently by fischler and susskind, who suggested that the holographic principle [5] may be

useful in constraining cosmological solutions [6], followed by several other investigations in

which their suggestion was critically examined or improved [7]. our discussion is closer to

that of [8], and in particular to that of [9] where a new hubble entropy bound (heb) was

formulated, and its relevance to the analysis of cosmological singularities in string cosmol-

ogy pointed out. the idea that geometric and quantum entropy should be added, and be

accompanied by gsl was introduced in [10].

we will focus on two sources of entropy. the rst source is geometric entropy sg, whose

origin is the existence of a cosmological horizon [11,12,10]. geometric entropy has been

calculated for special systems, but we assume that it is a general property of a system

with a cosmological horizon, resulting from the existence of causal boundaries in space-

2

time. the concept of geometric entropy is closely related to the holographic principle, and

it has appeared in this connection recently in discussion of cosmological entropy bounds.

for a system with a cosmological horizon, geometric entropy within a hubble volume is

given roughly, ignoring numerical factors, by the area of the horizon. the second source

is quantum entropy sq, associated with quantum uctuations. changes in sq take into

account quantum leakage of entropy, resulting from the well known phenomenon of freezing

and defreezing of quantum uctuations. for example, quantum modes whose wavelength

is stretched by an accelerated cosmic expansion to the point that it is larger than the

horizon, become frozen (exit the horizon), and are lost as dynamical modes, and conversely

quantum modes whose wavelength becomes smaller than the hubble length during a period

of decelerated expansion, thaw (reenter the horizon) and become dynamical again. this

form of entropy was discussed in [13,14]. obviously, there is a relation, which we will expose

more fully, between quantum and geometric entropy, since the rate of expansion of the

universe determines the cosmological horizon and the rate of change of quantum entropy.

we adopt the denition of the total entropy of a domain containing more than one

cosmological horizon [9], for a given scale factor a(t), and a hubble parameter h(t) = a/a,

the number of cosmological horizons within a given comoving volume v = a(t)3 is given
by the total volume divided by the volume of a single horizon, nh = a(t)3/|h(t)|3. if the
entropy within a given horizon is sh, then the total entropy is given by s = nhsh. we will

ignore numerical factors, use units in which c = 1, h = 1, gn = e/16,  being the dilaton,

and discuss only at, homogeneous, and isotropic string cosmologies in the so-called string

frame, in which the lowest order eective action is slo = r d4xgehr + ()2i.
n , and therefore specic geometric entropy is given by sg = |h|g1

in ordinary cosmology, geometric entropy within a hubble volume is given by its area

g = h2g1
sh

n [10].

a possible expression for specic geometric entropy in string cosmology is obtained by

substituting gn = e, leading to

sg = |h|e.

(1)

reassurance that sg is indeed given by (1) is provided by the following observation. the

action slo can be expressed in a (3 + 1) covariant form, using the 3-metric gij, the ex-
trinsic curvature kij, considering only vanishing 3ricci scalar and homogeneous dilaton,
slo = r d3xdtgije [3kijk ij  2gijtkij + k 2  (t)2] . now, slo is invariant under the
symmetry transformation gij  e2gij,    + 3, for an arbitrary time dependent .
from the variation of the action s = r d3xdtgije4k , we may read o the current

and conserved charge q = 4a3ek. the symmetry is exact in the at homogeneous case,

and it seems plausible that it is a good symmetry even when  corrections are present [15].
with denition (1), the total geometric entropy sg = a3|h|e, is proportional to the corre-
sponding conserved charge. adiabatic evolution, determined by tsg = 0, leads to a familiar

h

equation,

h   + 3h = 0, satised by the () vacuum branches of string cosmology.
quantum entropy for a single eld in string cosmology is, as in [14,10], given by

sq = z kmax

kmin

[16]. we are interested in solutions for which a/a    1/, and therefore, for all particles

sumption does not necessarily hold, but in standard radiation domination (rd) with frozen

dilaton all modes reenter the horizon. using the reasonable approximation f (k)  constant,
we obtain, as in [10],

sq = nh .

(3)

parameter  is positive, and in many cases proportional to the number of species of particles,

taking into account all degrees of freedom of the system, perturbative and non-perturbative.

4

the main contribution to  comes from light degrees of freedom and therefore if some non-

perturbative objects, such as d branes become light they will make a substantial contribution

to .

we now turn to the generalized second law of thermodynamics, taking into account

geometric and quantum entropy. enforcing ds  0, and in particular, ts = tsg +tsq  0,
leads to an important inequality,

(cid:16)h2e  (cid:17) tnh + nht(cid:16)h2e(cid:17)  0.

when quantum entropy is negligible compared to geometric entropy, gsl (4) leads to

yielding a bound on , and therefore on dilaton kinetic energy, for a given h,

(5) was rst obtained in [9], and interpreted as following from a saturated heb.

when quantum entropy becomes relevant we obtain another bound. we are interested

in a situation in which the universe expands, h > 0, and  and h are non-decreasing, and

therefore t(cid:16)h2e(cid:17)  0 and tnh > 0. a necessary condition for gsl to hold is that

entropy of reentering quantum uctuations. we stress that to be useful in analysis of

cosmological singularities (6) has to be considered for perturbations that exit the horizon.

we note that if the condition (6) is satised, then the cosmological evolution never reaches

the nonperturbative region described in [17], allowing a self-consistent analysis using the low

energy eective action approach.

it is not apriori clear that the form of gsl and entropy sources remains unchanged

when curvature becomes large, in fact, we may expect higher order corrections to appear.

for example, the conserved charge of the scaling symmetry of the action will depend in

5

general on higher order curvature corrections. nevertheless, in the following we will assume

that specic geometric entropy is given by eq. (1), without higher order corrections, and try

to verify that, for some reason yet to be understood, there are no higher order corrections

to eq. (1). our results are consistent with this assumption.

we turn now to apply our general analysis to the pre-big-bang (pbb) string cosmol-

ogy scenario [18], in which the universe starts from a state of very small curvature and

string coupling and then undergoes a long phase of dilaton-driven ination (ddi), joining

smoothly at later times standard rd cosmology, giving rise to a singularity free inationary

cosmology. the high curvature phase joining ddi and rd phases is identied with the big

bang of standard cosmology. a key issue confronting this scenario is whether, and under

what conditions, can the graceful exit transition from ddi to rd be completed [19]. in

particular, it was argued that curvature is bounded by an algebraic xed point behaviour

when both h and  are constants and the universe is in a linear-dilaton desitter space [15],

and coupling is bounded by quantum corrections [20,21]. but it became clear that another

general theoretical ingredient is missing, and we propose that gsl is that missing ingredient.

we have studied numerically examples of pbb string cosmologies to verify that the

overall picture we suggest is valid in cases that can be analyzed explicitly. we rst consider,

as in [15,22],  corrections to the lowest order string eective action,

with c = (2a+2d +1), is the most general form of four derivative corrections that lead to

early stages of evolution (red-dashed), and actions whose generic solutions satisfy classical gsl

while close to the (+) branch vacuum (blue-solid). the dots represent (a, d) values whose generic

solutions reach a xed point, and are all in the allowed region.

where , ,  are eective sources parameterizing the contribution of  corrections [22].

parameters a and d should have been determined by string theory, however, at the moment,

it is not possible to calculate them in general. if a, d were determined we could just use the

results and check whether their generic cosmological solutions are non-singular, but since a,

d are unavailable at the moment, we turn to gsl to restrict them.

first, we look at the initial stages of the evolution when the string coupling and h are

very small. we nd that not all the values of the parameters a, d are allowed by gsl. the

condition   0, which is equivalent to gsl on generic solutions at the very early stage of
the evolution, if the only relevant form of entropy is geometric entropy, leads to the following

condition on a, d (rst obtained by r. madden [23]), 40.05a + 28.86d  7.253. the values
of a, d which satisfy this inequality are labeled allowed, and the rest are forbidden.

in [22] a condition that  corrections are such that solutions start to turn towards a xed

point at the very early stages of their evolution was found 61.1768a + 40.8475d  16.083,
and such solutions were labeled turning the right way. both conditions are displayed

in fig. 1. they select almost the same region of (a, d) space, a gratifying result, gsl

forbids actions whose generic solutions are singular and do not reach a xed point. we

further observe that generic solutions which turn the wrong way at the early stages of

their evolution continue their course in a way similar to the solution presented in fig. 2. we

nd numerically that at a certain moment in time h starts to decrease, at that point h = 0

and particle production eects are still extremely weak, and therefore (5) is the relevant

bound, but (5) is certainly violated.

we have scanned the (a, d) plane to check whether a generic solution that reaches a

xed point respects gsl throughout the whole evolution, and conversely, whether a generic

solution obeying gsl evolves towards a xed point. the results are shown in fig. 1, clearly,

the forbidden region does not contain actions whose generic solutions go to xed points.

nevertheless, there are some (a, d) values located in the small wedges near the bounding

lines, for which the corresponding solutions always satisfy (5), but do not reach a xed point,

and are singular. this happens because they meet a cusp singularity. consistency requires

adding higher order  corrections when cusp singularities are approached, which we will

not attempt here.

if particle production eects are strong, the quantum part of gsl adds bound (6), which
adds another forbidden region in the (h, ) plane, the region above a straight line parallel
to the  axis. the quantum part of gsl has therefore a signicant impact on corrections

to the eective action. on a xed point  is still increasing, and therefore the bounding

line described by (6) is moving downwards, and when the critical line moves below the xed

point, gsl is violated. this means that when a certain critical value of the coupling e is

reached, the solution can no longer stay on the xed point, and it must move away towards

an exit. one way this can happen is if quantum corrections, perhaps of the type discussed

in [20,21] exist.

the full gsl therefore forces actions to have generic solutions that are non-singular,

classical gsl bounds dilaton kinetic energy and quantum gsl bounds h and therefore,

at a certain moment of the evolution h must vanish (at least asymptotically), and then

curvature is bounded. if cusp singularities are removed by adding higher order corrections,

as might be expected, we can apply gsl with similar conclusions also in this case. a

schematic graceful exit enforced by gsl is shown in fig. 3. we conclude that the use

of thermodynamics and entropy in string cosmology provides model independent tools to

analyze cosmological solutions which are not yet under full theoretical control. our result

indicate that if we impose gsl, in addition to equations of motion, non-singular string

cosmology is quite generic.
