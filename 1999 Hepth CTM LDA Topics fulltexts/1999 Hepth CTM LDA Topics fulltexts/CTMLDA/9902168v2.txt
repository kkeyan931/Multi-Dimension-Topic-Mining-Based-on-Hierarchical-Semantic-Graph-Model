abstract

non-supersymmetric d = 4 gauge theories which arise from superstring du-

ality on a manifold ads5  s5/zp are cataloged for a range 2  p  41.

a number have vanishing two-loop gauge function, a necessary but not

sucient condition to be a conformal eld theory.

the relationship of the type iib superstring to conformal gauge theory in d = 4 gives

rise to an interesting class of gauge theories [14]. choosing the simplest compactication

[1] on ads5  s5 gives rise to an n = 4 su(n) gauge theory which has been known for some

time [5] to be conformal due to the extended global supersymmetry and non-renormalization

theorems. all of the rge functions for this n = 4 case are vanishing in perturbation

theory.

one of us (phf) has recently [6] pursued the idea that an n = 0 theory, without

spacetime supersymmetry, arising from compactication [716] on the orbifold ads5  s5/

(with  6 su(3)) could be conformal and, further, could accommodate the standard model.

in the present note we systematically catalog the available n = 0 theories for  an abelian

discrete group  = zp. we also nd the subset which has (2)

g = 0, a vanishing two-loop

function for the gauge coupling, according to the criteria of [6]. in a future publication,

we hope to nd how many if any of the surviving theories satisfy (2)

y = 0 and (2)

h = 0

for the yukawa and higgs self-coupling two-loop rge functions respectively. note that

the one-loop functions satisfy (1)

y = 0 and (1)

h = 0 because they are leading order in

the planar expansion [1720]. all one-loop n = 0 calculations coincide with those of the

conformal n = 4 theory to leading order in 1/n. however, beyond large n and beyond

one-loop this coincidence ceases, in general.

the ideas in frampton [6] concerning the cosmological constant and model building

beyond the standard model provide the motivation as follows. at a scale suciently above

the weak scale the masses and vevs of the standard model obviously become negligible.

consider now that the standard model is promoted by additional states to a conformal

theory of the d = 4 n = 0 type which will be highly constrained or even unique, as well

as scale invariant. low energy masses and vevs are introduced softly into this conformal

theory such as to preserve the desirable properties of vanishing vacuum energy and hence

vanishing cosmological constant. since no supersymmetry breaking is needed and provided

the introduction of scales is suciently mild it is expected that a zero cosmological constant

can be retained in this approach.

2

the embedding of  = zp in the complex three-dimensional space c3 can be conveniently

specied by three integers ai = (a1, a2, a3). the action of zp on the three complex coordinates

(x1, x2, x3) is then:

(x1, x2, x3)

zp (a1x1, a2x2, a3x3)

(1)

where  = exp(2i/p) and the elements of zp are r (0  r  (p  1)).

the general rule for breaking supersymmetries is that for   su(2), there remains

n = 2 supersymmetry;   su(3) leaves n = 1 supersymmetry; and for  6 su(3), no

supersymmetry (n = 0) survives.

to ensure that  6 su(3) the requirement is that

a1 + a2 + a3 6= 0 (mod p)

(2)

each ai can, without loss of generality, be in the range 0  ai  (p  1). further we may

set a1  a2  a3 since permutations of the ai are equivalent. let us dene k(p) to be the

number of possible n = 0 theories with k non-zero ai (1  k  3).

since ai = (0, 0, a3) is clearly equivalent to ai = (0, 0, p  a3) the value of 1(p) is

1(p) = p/2

(3)

where x is the largest integer not greater than x.

for 2(p) we observe that ai = (0, a2, a3) is equivalent to ai = (0, p  a3, p  a2). then

we may derive, taking into account eq.(2) that, for p even

while, for p odd

2(p) = 2

(5)

for 3(p), the counting is only slightly more intricate. there is the equivalence of ai =

(a1, a2, a3) with (p  a3, p  a2, p  a1) as well as eq.(2) to contend with.

3

in particular the theory ai = (a1, p/2, pa1) is a self-equivalent (se) one; let the number

of such theories be se(p). then it can be seen that se(p) = p/2 for p even, and se(p) = 0
for p odd. with regard to eq.(2), let p(p) be the number of theories with p ai = p and
2p(p) be the number with p ai = 2p. then because of the equivalence of (a1, a2, a3) with
(p  a3, p  a2, p  a1), it follows that p(p) = 2p(p). the value will be calculated below; in

terms of it 3(p) is given by

3(p) =

1
2

[(p)  2p(p) + se(p)]

(6)

where (p) is the number of unrestricted (a1, a2, a3) satisfying 1  ai  (p  1) and a1 

a2  a3. its value is given by

(p) =

p1

it remains only to calculate p(p) given by

(cid:18)(cid:22)p  a1

2

(cid:23)  a1 + 1(cid:19)

(7)

(8)

the value of p(p) depends on the remainder when p is divided by 6. to show one case in

detail. consider p = 6k where k is an integer. then

p(p) =

2k1

xa1=odd

+ 1(cid:19) = 3k2 =

hence from eq.(6)

(p2  p + 2)

taking 1(p) from eq.(3) and 2(p) from eq.(5) we nd for p = 6k

t ot al(p) = 1(p) + 2(p) + 3(p) =

p
12

(p2 + 2p + 2)

for p = 6k + 1 or p = 6k + 5 one nds similarly

(13)

for p = 6k + 2 or p = 6k + 4

3(p) =

(p + 1)(p2  2p + 4)

(p = 6k + 2 or 6k + 4)

t ot al =

12

(p3 + 2p2 + 2p + 4)

(p = 6k + 2 or 6k + 4)

and nally for p = 6k + 3

3(p) =

(p3  p2  p  3)

(p = 6k + 3)

(17)

the values of 1(p), 2(p), 3(p), t ot al(p) and pp

p=2 t ot al(p) for 2  p  41 are listed

in table 1.

the next question is: of all these candidates for conformal n = 0 theories, how many if

any are conformal? as a rst sifting we can apply the criterion found in [6] from vanishing

of the two-loop rge function (2)

g = 0, for the gauge coupling. the criterion is that

a1 + a2 = a3. let us denote the number of theories fullling this by alive(p).

if p is odd there is no contamination by self-equivalent possibilities and the result is

alive =

p1

2

xr=1

(p  2r) =

1
4

(p  1)2

(p = odd)

(18)

for p even some self equivalent cases must be subtracted. the sum in eq. (18) is 1

4 p(p  2)

and the number of self-equivalent cases to remove is p/4 with the results

alive =

1
4

p(p  3)

(p = 4k)

alive =

1
4

(p  1)(p  2)

(p = 4k + 2)

(19)

(20)

in the last two columns of table 1 are the values of alive(p) and pp

p=2 alive(p).

5

asymptotically for large p the ratio alive(p)/t ot al(p)  3/p and hence vanishes al-

though alive(p) diverges; the value of the ratio is e.g. 0.28 at p = 5 and at p = 41 is 0.066.

it is being studied how the two-loop requirements (2)

y = 0 and (2)

h = 0 select from such

theories. that result will further indicate whether any alive(p) can survive to all orders.

one of us (phf) thanks david morrison for a discussion. this work was supported in
