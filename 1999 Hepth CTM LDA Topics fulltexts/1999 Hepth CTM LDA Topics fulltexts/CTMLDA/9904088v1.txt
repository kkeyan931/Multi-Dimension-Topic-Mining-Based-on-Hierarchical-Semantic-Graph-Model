1 introduction.

although the experiments of this paper, statistical and numerical, were undertaken in pursuit
of a goal not widely shared, they may be of general interest since they reveal a number of
curious properties of the two-dimensional ising model that had not been previously observed.
the goal is not dicult to state. although planar lattice models of statistical mechanics
are in many respects well understood physically, their mathematical investigation lags far
behind. since these models are purely mathematical, this is regrettable. it seems to us that
the problem is not simply to introduce mathematical standards into arguments otherwise well
understood; rather the statistical-mechanical consequences of the notion of renormalization
remain obscure.

our experiments were undertaken to support the view that the xed point (or points) of
the renormalization procedure can be realized as concrete mathematical objects and that a
rst step in any attempt to come to terms with renormalization is to understand what they
are. we have resorted to numerical studies because a frontal mathematical attack without
any clear notion of the possible conclusions has little chance of success. we are dealing with
a domain in which the techniques remain to be developed.

a xed point is a point in a space of presumably an innite number of dimensions; so
this point and all other points of the space are dened by an innite number of coordinates.
some will presumably be superuous, so that the total space is realized as a submanifold
of some larger coordinate space. the total space will be the carrier, in some sense, of
the renormalization transformation, but the transformation will not appear explicitly in
this paper. the point does! the implicit condition on each quantity serving as a possible
coordinate of the xed point is that, at the xed point itself, it remains invariant under
renormalization and that, at a critical point of any model within the class considered, its
value approaches a limit under repeated renormalization because renormalization drives the
critical point to the xed point. since repeated renormalization is in coarsest terms nothing
more than passage to larger and larger blocks or to smaller and smaller mesh, the condition
is that the quantity has a meaning as the mesh length goes to zero, the dimensions otherwise
remaining the same. for percolation this is a property of crossing probabilities. our point
of view is that any such quantity is a candidate as a possible coordinate in the space of
the xed point. rather than a single numerical quantity we can consider several at once,
which amounts in the customary mathematical way to considering objects lying in some
given space, nite-dimensional or innite-dimensional, for example, a space of probability
distributions, and if these objects satisfy this criterion, thus if, for each model at the critical
point, they tend to a limit as the mesh goes to zero, then this limit or rather its coordinates
in the given space can also serve as coordinates of the xed point. such objects are described
in the paper.

there are at least two possibilities: one modeled on the considerations for the free boson
of [l]; the other on the crossing probabilities for percolation [lpps, lps]. the second
possibility was suggested to us by haru pinson to whom we are grateful. thus to each form
m of the ising model (taken at the critical temperature) we will attach two points pd(m)
and pc(m), each dened by an innite number of coordinates. both are, in so far as this
can be conrmed by experiments, universal and conformally invariant in the sense of [lps].

2

it is unlikely that these two points are independent. one set of coordinates may well be
deducible from another, but we have not examined this possibility.

crossing probabilities may or may not be peculiar to a few models. the evidence for
their conformal invariance and universality is not dicult to present and appears in section
4. there is, however, one point to underline. the ising model is considered in regions that
may be bounded or unbounded. crossing probabilities are dened for crossings within a
region that may or may not coincide with the region in which the model is considered. it
may be smaller. in contrast to crossing probabilities for percolation, in which there is no
interaction, those for the ising model depend on both the region in which the crossings are
allowed to occur and the region of thermalization on which the ising model is considered.
conformal invariance refers to the simultaneous action of a conformal mapping on the pair
of regions.

the coordinates modeled on the free boson should, on the other hand, be available for a
large class of models. their denition is, in principle, quite general, but we have conned
ourselves to the ising model. the states  of the ising model take values in the set {1}
which is contained in the set of all complex numbers z with |z| = 1. this set in turn is covered
by the line z = exp(2ix). we simply develop the circle on the line. we rst assign to one
site p0 in the lattice the value h(p0) = 0 and then choose for all other p the value h(p) = m,
m  z, so that exp(ih(p)  ih(p0)) = (p)/(p0). of course, there has to be more method
than that. for example, for the square lattice we introduce clusters: maximal collections
of lattice sites of the same spin that are connected through bonds joining nearest-neighbor
sites. each cluster is surrounded by a curve constructed from edges of the dual lattice and
this curve separates it from all other clusters. to each of these curves an orientation is
assigned randomly and, for nearest neighbors p and q, we set h(p)  h(q) = , the sign
being determined by the relative orientation of the bond from p to q and the curve it crosses.
if it crosses no curve, then (p) = (q) and we take h(p) = h(q). thus to every state  are
attached several functions h, but h determines  up to sign. for a nite lattice the measure
on h, the set of all possible h is taken to be such that the measure, mi , on h assigns the
same mass to all points lying above a given . their sum is one-half the mass of .

fix now a bounded planar region d and consider the ising model in this region with
respect to a square lattice whose mesh a approaches 0. since the model is to be critical, the
contribution to the boltzmann weight of a pair of neighboring spins is

ej12,

sinh(2j) = 1,

j = .440687.

each h is in eect a function on the whole region if we take the value in the open square of
side a about the site p to be h(p). (the ambiguity at the boundary is disregarded here; it has
to be confronted in various ways from experiment to experiment.) if c is a (smooth) curve
in r, which can lie entirely in the interior or run entirely or partially along the boundary,
then we can restrict each function in h to c. this yields a set of points, each carrying a
mass, in the set dc of schwartz distributions on c, and thus a probability measure on dc.
experiments to be described in sections 2 and 3 suggest strongly that this measure has a
limit as the mesh tends to 0 and that the limit is universal and conformally invariant. this
is perhaps the most important conclusion of the paper.

3

there is no reason to restrict ourselves to planar regions and we begin our study with
the cylinder, because the ambiguities at the boundary are then absent. a long cylinder
(eectively semi-innite) is, provided we stay close to the end, to be regarded as equivalent
to a disk. the simplest conformally invariant distribution on the set of distributions on the
boundary of a disk is the gaussian distribution with respect to the quadratic form dened
by the dirichlet form. for a function  this form is obtained by extending  to a harmonic
function  in the interior and then taking

g

4z  (cid:18)  
x(cid:19)2

y(cid:19)2! dxdy.
+(cid:18)  

(1)

the experiments described in section 2 strongly suggest that the measure given by our
construction is at least very close to this gaussian and perhaps equal to it, with a constant
g = gb that appears to be universal. if c is interior, the measure on dc is not gaussian.
this is somewhat astonishing in view of the relation of the ising model to coulomb gases.
for the ising model on a triangular lattice our construction is equivalent to the usual one
for the o(1)-model. in particular, it is expected that in the plane

h(h(x)  h(0))2i 

2
g

ln|x  0|.

the constant g = gi is expected to be 4/3, at least for the triangular lattice, but the two
constants gi and gb are not equal.

gi = 4/3,

gb = 1.4710.

we suppose that gi is expected to be universal, but we have not examined this carefully.
the pertinent experiments are briey discussed in 6. the conclusion is that the comparison
with the free boson suggested by the distributions of this paper is quite dierent than the
one usually undertaken.

there is no reason that the two constants gi and gb should be equal. one refers to
interior behavior in the bulk, the other to behavior on the boundary. although a departure
from the conventional views, it could be argued (we do not attempt to do so here) that for
questions of renormalization the constant gb may be every bit as important as gi, or, better,
that the distributions on curves of section 2 are at least as important for renormalization
as asymptotic behavior because renormalization, at least as it is often presented, entails the
fusion of bounded regions (whose boundary may or may not partially coincide with that of
the region of thermalization). the distributions on dc were originally examined only for
curves on or close to the boundary. they appear, however, to be of interest even in the
absence of a boundary. see the last lines of paragraph 3.2.

our point of view would not be at all persuasive if there were no sign in our xed point
pd, thus in the measures on dc, of the critical indices 0, 1/2 and 1/16. thus section 5, in
which we describe what appear to us to be manifestations of, above all, the index 1/16, is
an essential part of the paper.

the nal section is less important.

it contains a few observations that provide some
perspective on the denitions of the paper. first of all, the construction of h is by no means

4

canonical. there are alternative constructions decribed in section 7. we can allow jumps
other than , in particular several jumps n, n odd, with equal or dierent probabilities.
they lead to dierent values of gi and to a measure on dc that is certainly not gaussian.
the possibility of not using clusters in our sense but the clusters of fortuin and kasteleyn
that appear in the high-temperature expansion of the ising (or more generally the potts)
model also suggests itself. such clusters can also be used to dene the crossing probabilities.
they lead to dierent measures and to dierent crossing probabilities, whose universality
and conformal invariance we have not tested.

finally we point out that the results for the distributions appear to remain valid at
innite temperature with, of course, a dierent value for the parameter appearing in the
gaussian.

we are grateful to michael aizenman, christian mercat, haru pinson and thomas
spencer for observations and suggestions that have been useful to us during the course of
these investigations.1 our most important debt is to the statistician christian leger whose
counsel and advice were of enormous help in the preparation of section 2.

universitat bonn available to him at an important moment in the experimentation.

2 distribution of h at the boundary.

2.1 the free boson on domains with boundary conditions.
the partition functions of a free boson , with compactication radius r, are familiar objects
when the domain is a torus, or a rectangle with the eld satisfying dirichlet boundary
conditions, thus equal to 0 on the boundary. for a general riemann surface with boundary
and for an arbitrary specication of the eld at the boundary, it may still be possible to
describe the partition functions explicitly (see [cg]). for a cylinder we use the formula of
[l]. as it suggested some of the statistical quantities for the ising model studied in this
paper, we review this formula.

the cylinder is described as the quotient of the region 0  w   ln q, 1  q > 0, in the
complex plane by the transformations generated by z  z + ,  = 2i. if the fundamental
domain is chosen to be 0  w <  ln q and 0  w < 2i, the map w  ew identies
the cylinder with the annulus of outer radius 1 and inner radius q. we shall use freely the
terminologies associated with the cylinder and with the annulus. observe that q is close to
zero for long cylinders. the angle  is used as the parameter on both the inner and the outer
boundary.

the extremal elds  on the domain are real harmonic functions

the boundary conditions x the restriction  of  to the boundary. on the inner circle
where z = qei and z = qei, this restriction is

(z, z) = 0 + a ln z + b ln z +xn6=0

(nzn + nzn).

in() = 0 + (a + b) ln q + i(a  b) +xk6=0

with the reality condition ab

require  to be periodic but imposes a milder condition: (e2iz, e2i z) = (z, z)2nr, n 
z, thus (a  b) = inr, n  z. since the lagrangian function (1) does not depend on the
term 0, this constant can be set to zero. therefore only the dierence of the constant terms
in in and out is of signicance and we choose to parametrize it with a variable x  [0, 2r)
and an integer m  z:

the partition function on the cylinder with the boundary values of  specied by in,

(a + b) ln q = x + 2mr.

out, or equivalently by x,{ab

is of importance and this gives, after proper normalization, a probabilistic measure on the
space of boundary data parametrized by ({ab
k }). the mixing of the boundary data at
both extremities becomes more and more intricate when q approaches 1 or, in other words,
when the cylinder becomes a narrow ring. when q is taken to zero, the measure simplies
as it becomes the product of two terms, each one depending on {ab
k }. moreover, in
the limit q = 0, the probabilistic interpretation of z is simply that of the gaussian measure
in the variables ab

k } or {bb

k },{bb

k and bb
k .

even though the coulomb gas provides a description of the minimal models, we do not
know of any similar explicit formula for the partition functions of these models for general
boundary conditions, although cardys paper [c1] treats explicitly the case of conformally
invariant boundary conditions. there are indeed only a nite number of these, and one of
the diculties addressed in this paper is how to introduce continuously varying conditions.
nonetheless we proceed boldly using the partition function (4) as a guide for the ising model.
in contrast to the free-boson model, the ising model dened on a graph g does not have a
eld taking its values in the whole real line that we could easily identify with   the spin
eld  takes its values in {+1,1}. starting from the spin eld , dened on the sites of a
(nite) graph g, one can construct the function h as described in the introduction. it is such
that, if p and q are joined, then h(p)  h(q) =  if (p) 6= (q) and h(p) = h(q) otherwise.
if the graph g is embedded in a surface d, for example, a cylinder or r2, this function h can
be extended to a function locally constant on d except on the edges of the dual graph where
it has jumps. the ising measure mi on the space of congurations on the graph g of mesh
a endows the (nite) set ha
d of possible functions h with a (discrete) probability measure.
(as observed above, this measure is such that ma
d(h) = 2mi()/n where n is the number
of distinct hs that lead to  and .)
take the graph to be the subset of the lattice az2 of mesh a = 1/lv formed by the
points (am, an), 0  m < lh, 0  n  lv . we identify upper and lower edges and
regard the graph as a subset of the cylinder: z = m + in  exp(2z/lv ). how can we

7

compare ha
d to the eld-theoretic measure of the free boson? using the same letters ak and
bk (but without the superscript b) for the fourier coecients of the restriction of h to the
extremities of a cylinder:

hin() =xkz

akeik

and hout() =xkz

bkeik,

we study the dependence upon ak and bk, k  {n,n + 1, . . . , n  1, n} of the measure
d on ha
ma
d, disregarding all other coecients. the object obtained this way is a measure
ma,n
d on r2(2n +1) concentrated on a nite set. keeping n xed, we then take the mesh
a on to zero. if the limit of the measures on r2(2n +1) exists, presumably as a continuous
distribution, the limit as the number 2n + 1 of fourier coecients is taken to innity can
be considered. we name the limiting object

md = lim
n

lim
a0

ma,n
d .

(7)

this measure, if it exists, is therefore dened on a space hi with coordinates ({ak},{bk}) and
we shall denote the elements of this space by i. this measure is to be compared with the
probability measure induced by (4) on the space of /r. (the radius of compactication
r appears here because we normalized the jumps of the function h to be , forcing h
to change by an integral multiple of 2 as  winds around one extremity.) the rst, and
principal, question is:

(i) does the measure md exist?

the parallel just suggested can be pushed further. we introduce rst the derivative h =
dh/d of the restriction of h to either extremity.
it is clearly a sum of delta functions
concentrated half way between those sites p and q at the boundary such that (p) 6= (q).
the mass of each jump is . we shall use the letter ak for its fourier coecients,

h() =xkz

akeik.

clearly ak = ikak. at the other end we use bk = ikbk. we will use ak equally for the coor-
dinates parametrizing i, the derivative di
d . for the boson, the probabilistic interpretation
of the partition function z implies that the k-th fourier coecient of the restriction in is
distributed (up to a normalizing factor) as exp(2k|ab
k |2) in the limit q = 0. consequently,
if we use the fourier coecients of

1
r

d
d

ckeik

k = rck, the probability density is e2r2|ck|2/k, again up to normalization. for a
with ikab
long cylinder the parallel drawn here raises the following questions on md granted, of course,
that the answer to (i) is positive:

(ii) are the fourier coecients ak of i distributed normally as ek|ak|2

(iv) is the joint distribution a product of independent single-variable distributions?
the rest of this section will describe the response to these questions provided by numerical
simulations. the next will provide evidence that this limit measure is both universal and
conformally invariant.

2.2 the distribution of h at the boundary of a long cylinder.

the diagrams of figure 1 are some evidence for the existence of the distribution md on the
space hi. they represent the probability distribution densities of h restricted to one of the
extremities of various cylinders, in terms of a single variable (either a1,a2,a4 or a8),
all others being disregarded or, thinking in terms of the limit, integrated out. by rotational
symmetry these densities are (almost) identical to those with respect to the imaginary part
of the same coecients. (a small discrepancy could arise from the fact that the numbers of
sites along the circumference were not divisible by 4.) the square lattices contained 59401,
79  157, 157  1067, 199  397, 397  793 and 793  1585 sites. the rst number (lv )
is the number of sites around the circumference and is half the number of sites along the
length (lh) minus one, or less. the appendix gives some further technical details on the
simulations. we note at this point that the partition function (4) is obtained by summing
over the integer n parametrizing the linear term (a  b) = inr in both out and out. the
analogue of this term for ising congurations is straightforward: a conguration with exactly

two clusters (of opposite signs) extending from one end to the other of the cylinder will have
two longitudinal jump lines. depending on the choice of the jump across these lines, h will
increase by 0, 2 and 2 as  wraps around the boundary. other (even) integral multiples
of  appear for congurations with more clusters crossing from one end to the other and the
numbers 2n can be used to partition the set of congurations. we have not dierentiated
the measure md for these various classes. we should add that, for the cylinders studied
in the present section, the congurations h whose linear term is zero are by far the most
probable. the multiples 2 occurred with a probability about .0005; higher multiples we
did not see at all.
even though the raw data clearly dierentiate the curves attached to smaller cylin-
ders, smoothing helped to separate the curves between the two largest one (397  793 and
793  1585). this smoothing was done using the kernel method with a gaussian kernel; the
smoothing parameter was chosen according to eq. (3.28) of [si], in which  was taken to be
the sample standard deviation.

the narrowing of the gaps between the curves as the number of sites is increased is a good
qualitative argument for the existence of the limit md = limn lima0 ma,n
d . the peaks
of the curves go down systematically as lv and lh increase, except for the dependence
on a1.
in this case the center of the curve for 793  1585 lies slightly above the center
for 397  793 on the small interval (0.05, 0.05). around a1 = 0.05 the two curves
cross and the curve for 793  1585 remains below that for 397  793 until approximately
a1 = +0.5. from then on (|a1| > 0.5) the two curves are so close that they cross each
other several times, probably due to the limitation of our samples. this puzzled us and was
checked independently by two of us. we have no explanation for it. as will be seen below
however, the variance of the samples, a more global indicator, increases systematically over
the spectrum of all the cylinders considered; in particular that of 793  1585 is larger than
that of 397  793.

these distribution densities are so similar to normal curves that their variances are a
natural tool for a more qualitative assessment of the nite size eects. in order to answer
questions (ii) and (iii), we plot in figure 2 the numbers

where lv lh
is the square root of the variance with respect to the variable ak for the
cylinder with lv  lh sites. (if both questions were to be answered positively, then the
numbers kk = k/22
would be a constant. note that we
follow the usual statistical convention of distinguishing between the theoretical value  of
a quantity and its measured value .) we plotted these numbers for k = 1, . . . , 10 (or,
sometimes, k = 1, 2, 4, 8), together with a linear t of these ten points for every cylinder size
on the square lattice considered, the largest triangular and hexagonal lattices, the anisotropic
lattice, and the 254  254 square and disk geometries. the latter will be discussed in in
section 3. the data, read from the top, appear in the order: cylinders of size 59  401,
79 157, 157 1067, 199 397 for the square lattice g(cid:3); of size 464 1069 for the hexagonal
lattice ghex; then of size 397  793 for g(cid:3); of size 312  963 for the anisotropic lattice; of
size 416  721 for the triangular lattice g; the cylinder of size 793  1585 for g(cid:3) and the
square of size 254  254 are superimposed; and nally the disk of radius r = 300.2 for g(cid:3).
the numerical data are also recorded in table i for k = 1, 2, 4, 8 together with those for
triangular and hexagonal lattices on a cylinder. the digit after the vertical bar gives the
statistical error on the digit just before; for example, the rst element in the table (1.609|3)
means that 1/2( 59401
)2 is 1.609 with the 95%-condence interval being [1.606, 1.612]. the
(statistical) error bars were not drawn on fig. 2 as their length is approximately the size
of the symbols used, or less. all the linear ts meet in a very small neighborhood on the

k

vertical axis. for the two cylinders with the greatest number of sites, the disk and the two
squares, the ordinates at the origin are all in the interval [1.47071, 1.47262], while the largest
cylinder and the disk meet at essentially equal values (1.47071 and 1.47095 respectively). it
is likely that, for the two smallest cylinders, a positive quadratic term would have improved
the t and narrowed the gap with the intersection of the others.

figure 3 reinforces this impression. the numbers lv lh

k

were drawn for all the linearly
independent fourier modes (but the constant one) for the cylinders 59  401 and 397 
793. since each function h 59401 is the sum of multiples of the same 59 -functions on the
circumference, it can be identied with a point in r59 that we choose to parametrize with
a0,a1,a1, . . . ,a29,a29. again the distributions with respect to ak and ak are
identical and the corresponding samples can be united. the 29 crosses on the plot are the
data for 59  401 and the 198 dots are those for 397  793. the horizontal axis was scaled
dierently for the two cylinders: the data were spread evenly on the interval [0, 1], starting
at 1
198 for 397 793. the crosses and the dots follow almost the same
curve when scaled that way. hence, the change in the slopes for the various cylinders (fig.
2) can be seen to be the eect of calculating the slope of a curve at the origin taking 10
values lying in an interval of length proportional to 1/lv . this is conrmed by a log-log
plot of these slopes (fig. 4). the six dots can be tted linearly and the slope is found to be
1.031 or, if the two smallest cylinders are discarded, 1.008. these results are indeed very
close to 1. (it is this second t that is drawn of the gure.) consequently the numbers

case for the distribution md. to be consistent with the denition of md as the limit (7) of
ma,n
d , we restrict rst our discussion to correlation coecients between pairs (x, y), x 6= y
(the choice n = 32
in {a0}  {aj,aj, j = 1, . . . , 32} on the cylinder 397  793.
is somewhat arbitrary but it does not change much the result as it will be seen below.)

there are (cid:0)65

2(cid:1) = 2080 such pairs. these 2080 estimates r(i, j)  [1, 1] turn out too be

so small (the largest in absolute value being 0.0064) that the real question is whether they
are distributed like correlation coecients of independent variables. according to ch. 5 of
[w] the correlation coecient of a pair of independent gaussian variables is distributed with
mean 0 on [1, 1] as

( n1

(10)

here n is the size of the sample used to measure the correlation coecient (n = 281000 for
the present calculation) and no longer the cuto n used to measure the distribution ma,n
d .
if we set r = s/n and apply stirlings formula, (10) becomes approximately

because the correlation coecients did not display any specic pattern, we compared all
the numbers r(i, j)n as if they were estimates of the same pair of random variables. the
mean and standard deviation of these quantities are 0.00006 and 1.013, very close to the
expected 0 and 1 and a plot of the empirical cumulative distribution of the rn is visually
indistinguishable from a plot of the cumulative distribution of the normal with mean 0 and
variance 1.

the independence of the variables {a0}  {aj,aj, j = 1, . . . , 32} for the cylinder
397  793 is quite remarkable. one might have thought that this independence would be

14

spoiled, at least partially, by nite-size eects. as a matter of curiosity we repeated the
above calculation for the whole set of linearly independent fourier coecients {a0} 
{aj,aj, j = 1, . . . , 198}. there are now (cid:0)397
2(cid:1) = 78606 values r(i, j). their mean is
0.003 and their variance, scaled by the factor n, is 1.002, again in good agreement with
the theoretical distribution of the rs. nevertheless a closer look at the data invalidate the
hypothesis that the variables are independent! let h0 be the null hypothesis that all the
variables in the set {a0}  {aj,aj, j = 1, . . . , 198} are independent. to check this
hypothesis we use a test of level 0.05, that is a test that will reject h0 only in 5% of the
cases when h0 is actually true. we shall reject h0 if any of the 78606 correlation coecients
falls outside a certain interval [r0, r0], where r0 is yet to be determined. if p (|ri| > r0) for
i = 1, . . . , 78606 denotes the probability that a given correlation ri be out of range, then the
probability of rejecting h0 is smaller than 78606  p (|ri| > r0). we shall therefore choose
r0 by requiring that p (|ri| > r0) = 0.05
78606 and the test will reject a true h0 in at most 5% of
the cases. under h0 the ri are distributed as (10). the number r0 is found to be 0.0094,
just below the largest value |r| measured (0.0097) and h0 needs to be rejected. if, as is more
to the point, the pairs considered are the 2080 for the set of ai and ai with i  32, the
extremity r0 of the interval is  0.008 and accomodates easily the maximum 0.0064 that we
measured. for this smaller set h0 need not be rejected. the very weak coupling between
the dierent frequencies  even those not pertinent to our investigations  of the fourier
expansion of the function h at the boundary of a long cylinder is striking.

the statistical independence of the fourier coecients, ak, at one extremity and those,
bk, at the other one can be studied similarly. the results are similar whether we restrict
the analysis to the ai,ai,bi and bi up to i = 32 or to the whole set. we describe
here the latter analysis. the zeroth (real) coecient a0 is equal to b0. we calculated the
correlation coecients for the other 3972  1 pairs and found that they are also extremely
small. the largest in absolute value was found to be 0.0083, small enough to accept the null
hypothesis that the random variables {ak} are independent of the variables {bk}.
there remains the question (ii): are the fourier coecients ak of i distributed normally
as ek|ak|2
? to address this question we used three complementary methods that we shall
refer to as the graphical method, the method of moments, and the method of goodness-of-t.
graphical methods seem a coarse way to assess whether an empirical distribution is a
given theoretical one. still they are a natural rst choice among the arsenal of statistical
techniques designed for this purpose. figure 5 plots the empirical histograms for md as mea-
sured on the cylinder 793 1585 as functions of a single variable (a1,a2,a4 and a8),
all other dependence being integrated out. for these plots we have joined the (essentially
independent) data for a1,a1,b1 and b1 which brings the sample to 1424000 cong-
urations. besides these four empirical distributions, four normal curves have been plotted
whose variances are those of the data. (these variances can be deduced from table i.) we
have left these empirical distributions as they are, in contrast to those seen on the figures
1, to distinguish them from the (smooth) normal curves and to give to the reader an idea
of the dierence between raw and smoothed data. for the dependence on a2,a4 and
a8, the ragged and smooth curves are essentially identical and, based on this evidence,
one is tempted to claim that md is distributed normally with respect to these variables.

the agreement between the two curves for a1 is clearly not so good. the empirical curve
lies above the normal curve at the center, crosses it before |a1| = 0.5 and remains under
it at least till |a1| = 1.0. the departure from normality is statistically signicant for the
dependence upon a1. after having observed this fact, one also sees, looking more closely, a
gap at the center of the curves for a2, though on a signicantly smaller scale. (it might not
even be visible if figure 5 has been too compressed.) since this departure from normality
surprised us and, especially, as it is easily observable only for a1, we tried to explain it as a
nite-size eect. the curves for the smaller cylinders are however similar and the gaps seem
similar to the eye. (the curves for a1 become wider as the number of sites is increased, as
is seen on fig. 1, but the variance of each sample also becomes larger.) if one is convinced
of conformal invariance, discussed in section 3, one can also use the data from an analogous
simulation performed on a disk whose boundary contained 2400 sites. for this geometry, the
two curves for a1, empirical and gaussian, show a similar gap. thus, on graphical evidence
only, we cannot conclude that the gap seen between md(a1) and the normal curve is a nite
size eect and that it is likely to disappear as lv, lh  . the other distributions (for
a2, a4 and a8) are, however, extremely close to gaussian.
our rst attempt at a more quantitative statement is through calculation of the moments
of the samples. we shall quickly see, however, the limitations of this approach. we denote
by l

2, 34, 156, 1058, 94510. none of the statisticians among our colleagues suggested the
moments as a quantitative tool, probably because of the enormous errors that these mea-
surements carry. indeed the variance on a measurement of l
k if i is odd and
k,i rapidly grows out of
hand as i increases. nonetheless the rst ten moments were calculated for the samples for
the cylinders 59  401, 79  157, 157  1067, 397  793 and 793  1585.
d is, by denition, an even function in all its variables, all the

the odd moments lie outside what would be the 95% condence interval if the distributions
were gaussian.

even though the errors on the moments l

k,i are large, it is instructive to plot some
of the moments as functions of log lv , for lv = 59, 79, 157, 397, 793. figure 6 shows the
quotients l
8, for i = 4, 6, that should tend to 3 and 15 respectively if the limit
distributions are gaussian. (the case i = 2 is the variance and was discussed previously.) for
the 8-th fourier coecient, these quotients are monotone decreasing for both i = 4 and 6 and
fig. 6 repeats in another way the visual observation made from fig. 5 that the distribution
md as a function of a8 is very close to a gaussian. the plots for the rst fourier coecient
are less conclusive: the overall behavior is decreasing, but not systematically, and the sixth
moment is still rather far from 15, perhaps an indication that 15 is not the limit.

the goodness-of-t technique is our last attempt to quantify the departure from nor-
mality of the dependence on the fourier coecients, particularly of a1. an overview of
this technique (or more precisely this set of techniques) is given in [das]. we are going to
concentrate on the random variable

known as the cramer-von mises statistic ([das], chap.4). in this expression n is the size of the
sample and f (x) the cumulative distribution function to which the data are to be compared,
in our case the gaussian whose variance is that of the sample. if the data x1, x2, . . . , xn are
ordered (xi  xi+1), then the empirical distribution function fn(x) = fn(x; x1, x2, . . . , xn) is
a step function dened by

fn(x) =

i = 1, . . . , n  1

the measure of integration df (x) in w2
n is equal to f (x)dx, where f (x) is the probability
distribution corresponding to f (x). the integral therefore gives more weight to intervals
in which the random variable x is more likely to fall. this is particularly well-suited for
our purpose as the gap between empirical and proposed distributions is precisely where the
distribution peaks. note that, if the data xi, i = 1, . . . , n, are not distributed according to
the distribution f proposed, the variable w2

n will grow with the sample size n.

the null hypothesis h0 is, henceforth, that fn(x) is a measurement of a variable whose
distribution is f . under the null hypothesis h0, anderson and darling [ad] gave an analytic
expression a(w2) for the asymptotic probability distribution of w2
n, that is, the distribution
of the variable w2
n when the sample size n is taken to innity. we used their formula (4.35)
to plot the curve of figure 7. in chapter 4 of [das], stephens indicates corrections to be
applied to w2
n that allows nite samples to be compared to the asymptotic distribution. for
the ns that will be used below these corrections are negligible. the two rst moments of

we concentrate on two fourier coecients, a1 and a8, as our goal here is to see whether
the departure from normality for a1 can be quantied and whether it decreases with the

18

increase in the number of sites of the lattice. again we consider ai,ai,bi and bi
as independent and following the same statistics. we can either split the whole available
samples into smaller sets of n elements or measure the variable w2
n for a very large n. with
the rst method, a good average w2
n can be calculated if the number n/n of smaller sets is
large enough. the second method will provide a single number that will, with luck, clearly
reject h0 if it has to be rejected. we apply both.

in splitting the large samples into smaller sets, we have to make a careful choice for n. one
restriction comes from the actual values of the l2-integral that we want to measure. using the
data for the cylinder 397793 in the rst format described in the appendix (that is, grouped
(fn(x)  f (x))2df (x)
in 401 bins), we can estimate an order of magnitude of w2
for the whole sample. (this was done using not the technique suggested by statisticians
[das, ad] but using rather the naive riemann integral over these 401 bins, f (x) being
estimated at the center of these bins. we did not attempt to evaluate the error in these
calculations.) for a1 this integral is 0.000046 and approximately 10 times smaller for a8.
even though there is an important statistical error on these numbers they give us an idea of
the order of magnitude. we are therefore measuring a very small departure from normality

n/n =r 



if any. on the one hand, the strategy of splitting the sample requires to get an average cw2

n
good enough that, if it is dierent from 1
6, the dierence is unlikely to be of statistical origin
and should instead indicate that h0 needs to be rejected. in other words, one should break
the sample into several smaller samples to get a good average. on the other hand, if h0
is false, the quantity w2
n increases with n. since the second moment of the distribution for
n is rather large ( 1
w2
45 ), we need to choose n large enough that the statistical error on
w2
n be reasonably smaller that the number itself. a rough estimate of this error is given by
q 1
45(n/n) where n/n is the number of sets obtained by splitting the sample of size n into
subsets of n elements. there is an obvious compromise to be struck and we chose n = 1000.
n for the three cylinders 59  401, 157  1067 and 397  793 using the
methods described in [das, ad]. these cylinders are the three runs whose data were kept
in the second format described in the appendix, so that the exact values of all the xi were
available. this format allowed us to compute again the coecients ai (and bi for 397793).
the two histograms for a1 (dots) and a8 (crosses) for the cylinder 59  401 are plotted on
figure 7 together with the asymptotic distribution a(w2). the range [0, 0.8] accounts for
more than 99% of the observations. even though the crosses seem to follow more closely the

we measured w2

curve than the dots, a quantitative assessment is not inappropriate. the number n/n of cw2
n listed in table ii is 2p1/(45  2064)  0.0066. note that, for a8, the intervals

n
is at least 2064 for each of the three cylinders and, consequently, the statistical error on the
resulting w2
of condence around the average w2
6, the predicted mean. any departure
from normality for a8, if any, cannot be observed from this test. for a1, the predicted 1
6
always falls outside of the 95%-condence interval, though barely so for 397  793. this
conrms the graphical observation made earlier and forces us to reject h0.

table ii: the means w2

n for n = 250000.

as described earlier the other strategy is to compute the numbers w2

n for a large n. we
chose n = 250000. the disadvantage of doing so is clearly that one has a single measurement
of w2
n for the dependence
on a8 is small for all three cylinders and the hypothesis that as the size of the cylinder (as well
n approaches a(w2) is totally acceptable. however,
as n) goes to innity the distribution of w2
n of a1 indicate that, almost surely, they do not follow these statistics. the

null hypothesis h0 must be rejected for a1.

the null hypothesis refers, however, to a lattice of a given size and it is not these with
which we are ultimately concerned; it is rather the limit of the distributions as the lattice
size tends to innity that is relevant. one obvious observation from table ii is that the
gap between the empirical data and a gaussian curve is narrowing as the number of sites
increases. even though h0 has been rejected, we used the variable w2
n, n = 250000, to
examine the relationship between the gap and lv . we did further runs, calculating only
the value of w2
n for the dependence on a1. for each of the lattices 59  157, 77  155, 101 
203, 125 251, 157 313, 199 399, 251 501 and 397 793, we obtained between 20 and 53
measurements of the variable w2
n. since h0 does not hold, we do not know the distribution
of this random variable. on the log-log plot 8, we drew the average for each lattice ()
together with the whole sample (dots). the spread in the sample for each lattice shows
that the variance is very large and thus underlines the diculty of obtaining a reliable
mean for w2
n(lv ) is monotone decreasing and the linear t
of the data (with the rst two excluded) plotted on figure 8 indicates that a power law,
(w2
6)  lv  (  2.48,   .278), is a reasonable hypothesis. we point out however
that, with our measurements of w2
n, we could hardly choose between the above power law
or any of the form (w2
n  x)  lv  with x in the interval [0, 1]. for this we would need
lv   1/6 or lv  10000.
so, are the fourier coecients ak distributed normally? for k large enough (say k  4),
it is impossible with our samples to see or calculate any dierence between the empirical
and the normal distributions. for small k, particularly for a1, the gap is obvious but the
goodness-of-t technique provides clear evidence that it decreases as the size is increased.
that the gap vanishes as lv, lh   is not a claim on which we care to insist given only
the present data.

3 universality and conformal invariance

of the distributions of h on closed loops.

3.1 two hypotheses.

various crossing probabilities were measured in [lps] for several percolation models at their
critical points. their fundamental character was stressed by two general hypotheses, one
of universality, the other of conformal invariance, that were convincingly demonstrated by
the simulations. the same two hypotheses will be demonstrated for the ising model at
criticality in section 4. in this section, we propose similar hypotheses for the distribution of
the function h introduced above and confront them with simulations.

we have considered in the previous section the ising model on the square lattice. other
lattices could be used. the strength of the coupling could vary from one site to another.
aperiodic lattices could be considered or even random ones.
it is, however, easier to be
specic and to consider two-dimensional planar periodic graphs g. we adopt, as in [lps],
the denition used by kesten [k] in his book on percolation: (i) g should not have any loops
(in the graph-theoretical sense), (ii) g is periodic with respect to translations by elements of
a lattice l in r2 of rank two, (iii) the number of bonds attached to a site in g is bounded.
(iv) all bonds of g have bounded length and every compact set of r2 intersects nitely
many bonds in g and (v) g is connected. an ising model is a pair (g, j) where j is a
positive function dened on bonds, periodic under l. the function j is to be interpreted
as the coupling between the various sites. only some of the models (g, j) will be critical,
or, as often expressed, each model is critical only for certain values of the couplings j. the
following discussion is restricted to models at criticality.

let d be a connected domain of r2 whose boundary is a regular curve and let c be a
parametrized regular curve (without self-intersection) in the closure of d. if (g, j) is an
ising model, one can measure the distribution md,c({ak};g, j) as we did in the previous
section for md on the square lattice. (although the coordinates ak will ultimately become
our preferred coordinates, we continue for the moment with the ak.) the limit on the mesh
can be taken either by dilating c and d with the dilation parameter going to innity while
g xed or by shrinking the planar lattice g uniformly while keeping c and d xed. as
before we shall assume that this limit measure exists for every regular c. the previous
section gave strong support for that statement when c is the boundary of d and (g, j) the
isotropic ising model on the square lattice. we examine the following hypothesis.
hypothesis of universality: for any pair of ising models (g, j) and (g, j), there
exists an element g of gl(2, r) such that for all d and c

md,c({ak};g, j) = mgd,gc({ak};g, j).

(12)

the notation gd and gc stands for the images of d and c by g. the transformation g does
not aect the underlying lattice g. for example, if g is the regular square lattice, it remains
the regular square lattice. the domains d and gd are simply superimposed on g and on
g. for the usual ising models, those dened on other symmetric graphs (the triangular and
the hexagonal) with constant coupling or the model with anisotropic coupling on a square

22

lattice, the matrix g is diagonal. it is easy to introduce models for which g would not be
diagonal. we have not done so for the ising models, but an example for percolation is to be
found in [lps].

to introduce the hypothesis of conformal invariance of the distributions md,c({ak};g, j),
it is easier to restrict at rst the discussion to the ising model on the square lattice g(cid:3)
with the constant coupling function j(cid:3). a shorter notation will be used for this model:
md,c({ak}) = md,c({ak};g(cid:3), j(cid:3)). we endow r2 with the usual complex structure, in other
words we identify it with the space of complex numbers in the usual way. for this complex
structure any holomorphic or antiholomorphic map  denes a conformal map, at least
locally. given two domains d and d1 we consider maps  that are bijective from the closure
of d to the closure of d1 and holomorphic (or antiholomorphic) on d itself. thus d1 = d.
let c be the image of c.

hypothesis of conformal invariance: if  satises the above conditions, then

where the fourier coecients a

where c is the restriction of  to c, hd is the function h on the domain d and  is the
(usual) arc-length parameter of the original loop c.

even though we have formulated this hypothesis for the ising model on the square lattice
with constant coupling, it is clear that it can be extended to any model (g, j) using the
hypothesis of universality.

3.2 simulations.

since the curve c is no longer necessarily an extremity of a cylinder, our rst step is to
acquire some intuition about the measure md,c for curves c inside the domain d. to do
so, we continue our investigation of the cylinder for (g(cid:3), j0). thus d remains the cylinder,
but we select several curves inside it. on the cylinder 397  793 the curves ci are sections
coinciding with the leftmost column (c0), the 9-th column (c1), the 17-th (c2), the 33-
rd (c3), the 65-th (c4) and the middle column (c5). these curves are at a distance of
0, 0.0201, 0.0403, 0.0806, 0.161 and 0.997 from the boundary measured as a fraction of the
circumference. to the distributions on these curves, we have joined those on the curves
symmetric with respect to the middle of the cylinder, doubling the numbers of congurations
studied for all of them but the middle one. we have not checked that the measurements on
one curve and one its mirror image are statistically independent. however the closest pair
(the curves on columns 65 and 729) are at a distance of 665 mesh units, that is, more than
5
6 of the full length of the cylinder. since the fourier coecients at the two extremities were
shown in the previous section to be independent, we must not be very far from statistical

23

independence in the present case either. figure 10 presents the measure md,ci as functions
of the real part of the fourier coecients ak, k = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32. each graph shows the
dependence on a xed ak for the six curves. on each graph the lowest curve at the origin
corresponds to c0 = boundary, the case studied in section 2. as the curve c is taken closer
to the center of the cylinder, the distribution becomes sharper at the center. this is perhaps
to be expected as the sites at the boundary are freer to create clusters of intermediate size
than are the sites in the bulk, increasing thereby the values of the various fourier coecients.
(see figures 9 and 15.) another natural feature is the gathering of the distributions for all
the interior curves on the plot for a16 and a32. indeed the higher fourier coecients
ak probe small scale structure, at the approximate scale of 1
k in circumference units. for
example, the fourier coecient a32 will be sensitive mostly to clusters having a diameter
of  12 mesh units or less and these clusters intersecting the curves c at a distance of 32 or of
64 mesh units from the extremity should be distributed more or less the same way. in other
words the bulk behavior is reached closer to the boundary for higher fourier coecients. one
last observation about these plots is that the bulk distribution is denitely not a gaussian in
a1! it is sharply peaked at the center but still has a wide tail. (the distribution in a1
measured along the mid-curve of the cylinder can be better seen on figure 11 below.)
to examine the hypotheses of universality and conformal invariance, we ran simulations
on other pairs (g, j) and on other geometries. we discuss both at the same time. three
other pairs (g, j) were considered: the regular triangular and hexagonal lattices g and ghex
with the constant function j and the regular square lattice g(cid:3) with a function j that takes
a constant value jh on the horizontal bonds and another constant value jv on the vertical
ones with jh = 2jv. we shall call this model the anisotropic ising model. this choice of
j makes the horizontal bonds stronger than the vertical ones and clusters of identical spins
will have a shape elongated in the horizontal direction if compared to those of the isotropic
model (g(cid:3), j(cid:3)).
the critical couplings are determined by sinh 2jh sinh 2jv = 1 (see [b] or [mw]). if the
hypothesis of universality is accepted then it follows from formula (5.9) of xi.5 of [mw] that
the matrix g that appears in (12) (when (g, j) is the critical model on the square lattice

(the critical value of jh for which jh = 2jv is 0.609378 . . . .) the lattice used for the
anisotropic model has lv = 312 and lh = 963. these dimensions correspond to a cylinder
on the square lattice with a horizontal/vertical ratio of 1.999, very close to the one used
for the square lattice 397  793 that has a ratio 1.997. the lattice used for the triangular
lattice was oriented in such a way that every triangle had one side along the horizontal axis
and the dimensions used were lv = 416, that is, the number of horizontal lines containing
sites, and lh = 712, the number of sites on these lines. the aspect ratio for a square
lattice corresponding to these numbers is 2.001. the largest hexagonal lattice used was of
size 464 1069. again 464 is the number of horizontal lines containing sites and lh = 1069
is the length of the cylinder in mesh units. the corresponding aspect ratio for the square
lattice is 1.995. we also measured the smaller hexagonal lattices of sizes 116  267 and
235  535. the dierence between these four ratios is smaller than the limitation due to
niteness discussed in [lpps]. the distances of the curves ci from the boundary were chosen
as close as possible to those used for the cylinder on (g(cid:3), j(cid:3)) and given above. (the manner
in which the fourier coecients of the restriction of h to these curves were calculated is
described in the appendix.)

as evidence for the hypothesis of conformal invariance, we compared three dierent
geometries, namely the cylinder used in paragraph 2.2, a disk, and a square. we identify
the cylinder with the rectangle in the complex plane of height v (its circumference) and of
length h. the analytic function z  e2z/v maps this cylinder onto an annulus. with our
choice of dimensions for the cylinder (v = 397, h = 793), the ratio of the inner and outer
radii is less than 105 and unless the outer diameter of the annulus is larger than 105, the

properties of the ising model are discussed from quite a dierent standpoint.

inner circle contains a single site. we took the freedom to add this site to the domain and
to identify it with a disk. in other words, although the geometries of the cylinder and of the
disk are not conformally equivalent in the sense of the hypothesis, the nite size realization
used here for the disk diers by a single site from the annulus conformally equivalent to the
cylinder. the radius of the disk was taken to be 300.2. the disk can be mapped onto the
square by the schwarz-christoel formula

which denes a map, with the unit disk as domain, holomorphic except in the four points
ei/4. both maps satisfy our requirements. for the square and the disk, the distributions
were measured at the boundary. for the disk, they were also measured on the four circles
corresponding to the inner circles on the cylinder that are not at its center. this latter
circle on the cylinder is mapped, inside the disk of radius r = 300.2, onto a circle of radius
 0.57, less than one mesh unit. the distribution md,c on this circle is clearly impossible
to measure for this lattice size.
table i of the previous section has been completed with the data k = k/2( k)2 for
the ve new experiments: the three new ising pairs (g, j) (triangular lattice, hexagonal
lattice and anisotropic function j) on the original cylindrical geometry and the two new
geometries (disk and square) covered by the square lattice. for the square, two runs were
made on a lattice of 80  80 and 254  254 sites. the data for the disk and both squares
were also drawn on figure 2. as discussed previously, it can be seen there that their ks
follow exactly the same pattern as those of the cylinders and that the ordinate at the origin
of their ts falls in the same very small window [1.47071, 1.47262]. it is interesting to notice
that the small lattice 80 80 on the square geometry leads to ks that are between those of
the lattices 199  397 and 397  793 for the cylinder. considering that the number of sites
in the lattice 199  397 is more than twelve-fold that in the small square, this might seem
surprising. the explanation is likely to be that the number of sites on the boundary where
the distribution is measured is the leading cause of the nite size eect. the ks for the
triangular lattice and for the anisotropic model were obtained from the 401-bin histograms of
the empirical distributions. (see the appendix.) no attempt was made to provide condence
intervals. the linear ts of the k, k = 1, 2, 4, 8, are 1.4723 + 0.0152k (triangular lattice)
and 1.4695 + 0.0180k (anisotropic model). for the largest of the square lattices it was
1.4712 + .0102k. the ordinates at the origin (1.4723, 1.4695 and 1.4712) are extremely close
to the narrow window above for the larger cylinders, the disk and squares, especially striking
as the samples for these experiments (200k) were the smallest of all in this section and the
previous one. the linear t for the largest of the hexagonal lattices is 1.4793 + .0294k and
the ordinate at the origin is not quite so good but the slope remains large compared with
the other ts. indeed the product of the slope and the circumference lv is in the four cases:
 8.1 (square);  6.3 (anisotropic);  6.4 (triangular);  14. (hexagonal). this suggests
that the circumference of the hexagonal lattice must be twice that of the triangular lattice in
order to obtain comparable results, perhaps because it contains only half as many bonds per
site as the triangular lattice. the ordinate at the origin (1.4770) is nevertheless close and
this is important because it conrms the suitability of the construction of the function h that

is described in the appendix, a construction less obvious and more dicult to implement for
the hexagonal lattice than for the others.

the plots of figure 11 show the measure as a function of a1 and a8 when h is
restricted to three dierent curves on the cylinder or to their conformal images on other
geometries: the boundary, the second inner circle (at a distance 0.0403 from the boundary
measured as a fraction of the circumference) and the circle in the middle of the cylinder. for
the boundary (rst column of figure 11) ve models have been drawn: the cylinder covered
with the square, the triangular and the anisotropic lattices, the disk and the square both
covered with the square lattice. (the numbers of sites on the various lattices are those given
earlier in this paragraph; only the data for the square of side 254 were drawn here.) for the
second column of the gure, the same models were used but no measurements were made
for the square. for the curve in the middle (third column), only the three lattices on the
cylinder were measured, because the corresponding circle on the disk is too small to allow
for reliable measurements. (see below.) to these three lattices a fourth square lattice, with
199  2399 sites, was added on the a1 plot. the agreement is convincing, as it is for the
distributions along the other curves ci that we measured.
at rst glance no cogent comparison can be made between the central circle on the
cylinder and a circle in the disk. a circle in the middle of a short cylinder is equivalent to a
circle in an annulus, but when the cylinder becomes extremely long, it is more like a circle
in the plane. for example, if the cylinders of size 397  793 and 199  2399 are mapped to
an annulus of outer radius 1, the inner radii will be 4  106 and 1  1033 and the images
of the central circles will have radii 2  103 and 4  1017 respectively (too small to make
a measurement). all circles in the plane are, however, conformally equivalent. so we can
still compare the distributions on the central circle of a cylinder with the distribution on a
circle in the plane. this is easier said than done, because the larger the circle the larger the
domain needed to make useful measurements. there is none the less a method, so that the

radius 100.2 (+), 200.2 () and 300.2 (). the continuous lines represent the corresponding
data for the cylinder 397  793.

distributions measured on the central circle on both cylinders 397  793 and 199 2399 can
be considered as distributions in the bulk.
we rst calculate the ks for progressively smaller circles inside disks and observe that
they do tend toward a limiting distribution. the main diculty is again the nite-size
eect revealed in figure 2. we compare corresponding inner circles on disks of radius
100.2, 200.2, 300.2. on each of these, the distributions were measured on inner circles of
radius 1., 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1319, 0.1 and 0.04790 times the outer radius. the smallest inner
circle on the disk of radius 100.2 has a radius 4.8 in mesh units. finite-size eects will be
indeed important! though we measured the ks for k up to 32, the overall behavior is clear
for k = 1, . . . , 8, as presented on figure 12. only the circles of relative radius 1., 0.4, 0.2
and 0.0479 were retained for ease of reading. the + are for the disk of radius 100.2, the
 for 200.2, the  for 300.2 and the corresponding data for the cylinder 397  793 are
joined by straight lines. for the boundary, the three disks give a better approximation of
the limiting distributions than the cylinder but for the inner circles the roles are exchanged.
the spread between the three disks, and between them and the cylinder, is particularly
important for the smallest inner circles but the way it decreases with the increase of the disk

inner circles.

radius supports the hypothesis that a common distribution for these two geometries exist
on each of these circles.

a comparison of the distributions on inner circles for the disk and the cylinder is therefore
possible. figure 13 shows the ks, k  {1, 2, . . . , 32}, for the cylinder 397  793 () and
the disk of radius 300.2 (+). curves were added to help the eye. seven circles were used.
their distance from the boundary of the cylinder, in mesh units, and their relative radius for
the disk (in parenthesis) are 0(1.), 8(0.881), 16(0.776), 32(0.602), 64(0.363), 128(0.132) and
192(0.0479). the measurements on the central circle of the cylinder were added ((cid:4)). only
for the two smallest circles of radius 0.132 and 0.0479 is the agreement less convincing but,
again, the previous gure showed how the gap diminishes as the outer radius increases. we
shall therefore refer to the limiting distribution, approached by that on central circles of
cylinders and on very small inner circles of disks, as the bulk behavior irrespective of the
global geometry.

although the random variable a1 is not normal, figure 11 and, less clearly, figure 10
show that higher fourier coecients are close to normal. in fact, starting around k = 8,
the histograms of the ak are graphically undistinguishable from the normal curves whose
variances are those of the samples. one may ask quite naturally if the distribution of these
variables is given, at least asymptotically, by the law (8) with, maybe, another constant rbulk.
the linear t for the bulk
is 4.380 + 0.0065k and the slope is slightly smaller than that of
the boundary, an indication that nite-size eects are smaller in the bulk.
it therefore
seems likely that the variables ak are asymptotically normally distributed as in (8) with

k

29

(rbulk)2 = 2.190. the ratio (rbulk)2/r2

b is 2.98, very close to 3.

the existence of a bulk behavior on nite geometries is by no means initially evident.
one supposes that the distribution of spins in a xed, bounded region for the ising model
on the complete planar lattice at criticality on a lattice whose mesh is going to 0 is such
that they are overwhelmingly of one sign with substantially smaller islands of opposite signs
and that these islands in their turn are dotted with lakes and so on. this is conrmed by
the two typical states of figure 9 in which the large islands of opposite spin appear only in
regions inuenced by the boundary. typical states for the cylinder are similar (figure 15)
but the conformal geometry is such that the bulk state is reached closer to the boundary.
the conclusion is not, apparently, that in an enormous disk, thus in the plane, the integral
of h against any xed smooth function on a xed smooth curve is generally very close to
0, so that the distribution of each of the fourier coecients ak and ak approaches a
-function. rather, they are approaching a distribution which is not trivial but is, at least
for k small, clearly not a gaussian. what we may be seeing is the eect of the shifting
boundaries of the large regions of constant spin. once a circle in the plane is xed, the
boundary between even two very large regions of dierent spin can, as the conguration is
varied, cut it into intervals of quite dierent size.

3.3 clarication.

in order not to encumber the initial discussion with unnecessary abstraction, we worked
with the distributions md,c({ak},g, j). a better theoretical formulation would be in terms
of a measure md,c on the set of real-valued distributions in the sense of schwartz on the
oriented smooth curve c, or if c were merely regular (thus suciently dierentiable) on
some sobolev space. to be more precise, the measure is on the set of distributions that
annihilate the constant functions. (to be even more precise, this is so only if the curve is
contractible. for other curves, such as the circumference of a cylinder, the set of distributions
whose value on the constant function 1 lies in {2m | m  z, m 6= 0}, may have a nonzero
measure. under many circumstances, it is small enough that it can for numerical purposes be
supposed 0.) to introduce the measure md,c concretely, we need a basis for the dual space,
thus in principle just a basis for the smooth (or regular) functions on c modulo constants.
if this basis is {k|k = 1,} then   {(k)} denes a map of the distributions into a
sequence space and a measure is just a measure on the collection of real innite sequences,
{1, 2, . . .}. it would have to be dened by some sort of limiting process from measures on
rn . the simplest such measures are product measures. given such a measure on the space
of real sequences, it denes, at least intuitively, a measure on distributions if for almost all
sequences {k}, the assignment k  k extends to a distribution, thus in particular if it
lies in some sobolev space. for example, if a parametrization x(), 0    2 of the curve
has been xed then one possible choice of the basis is the collection

{x()  eik, x()  eik|k > 0}

then it is better to put the k together in pairs and to use sequences {ak} (or ak = ak/ik)
of complex numbers. this has been the point of view of this paragraph. starting with a

30

given parametrization, we examined the joint distributions of the complex random variables
ak.

the parametrization also allows us to introduce the measure d/2 and thus to identify
functions with distributions. in particular, in order for a measure on sequences to yield a
measure on distributions it is necessary, and presumably usually sucient, that the sum

akeik

xk=

converges as a distribution for almost all sequences ak. for example, if the measure is a
gaussian dened by

exp(

k|ak|2)

(16)

xk=1

then the expectation e(|ak|2) is 1/(2k), so that p|ak|2/k converges almost everywhere.

as a result, the sum (16) converges almost everywhere as a distribution.

our method is numerical, so that we approximate the measure on sequences from a large,
nite scattering of functions h, or rather of their derivatives, because the derivative h is well
dened as a distribution, although h itself is not. the distribution h is a sum of -functions,
with mass  at each point where the curve crosses a contour line of the function h. since
its value on the constant function 1 is the sum of those jumps, this value is 0, as noted,
whenever that sum necessarily vanishes, either because the curve is contractible or because
the cylinder is extremely long.

although our construction required a specic parametrization, the resulting measure on
distributions may be independent of the parametrization and, more generally, even of the
choice of basis. we did not attempt to verify this. it may be useful, however, to describe an
example.

when d is a disk of radius 1 with the boundary c parametrized in the usual way by
arc length , the function h can be recovered by integration with respect to d from the
distribution h. the measure on distributions on c is very close to if not equal to the
gaussian measure associated to a constant, 2r2
b, times the dirichlet form q(h). we recall
that to calculate q(h), or q(h, h) if we want to stress that it is a quadratic form, we
extend the function h as a harmonic function to the interior and then

q(h) = d(h) = d(h, h) =

suppose for example that d is a square of side 

2 and that we parametrize its boundary
by arc length: s = s(t), s(0) being one of the vertices. we write t = t(s) for the inverse
function. the schwarz-christoel map  of the disk onto the square is depicted in figure 14
where the curves intersecting at the center of the square are the image of the rays on the disk.

of the disk are the curves intersecting at the center of the square.

although arcs of equal length on the circular boundary are mapped to intervals of dierent
lengths on the edge of the square, this eect is important only close to the vertices. thus
if k is the function s(t)  cos(kt) and k = k   then the distribution of the random
variable dened by k should be gaussian with variance d(k)/r2
b. moreover d(k) is
obtained from the fourier coecients of k and they are calculated by observing that, apart
from a constant factor, which is unimportant, the schwarz-christoel transformation (15)
restricted to the boundary w = ei of the unit disk can be expressed in terms of the elliptic

for a given l the random variables al and al are identically distributed on the disk, at
least when the number of sites at the boundary is a multiple of 4. on the square they were
shown to be also identically distributed, at least in the limit of the simulations, when these
variables are measured with respect to the induced parameter. however, if the arc-length
parameter s is used on the square, the two variables as
l are identically distributed
only when l is odd. the graphs of two functions cos(l(t)) and sin(l(t)) are translations of
each other when l is odd but not when l is even. the variances of the random variables as

rst fourier coecients clk, k = 1, . . . , 250, the parseval identity for the function cos l(t)
is satised to only ve decimal digits. we decided nonetheless to restrict the sums (23) to
these 250 rst coecients. since all the terms in d(l) are positive, the truncated sums will
lead to larger estimates of the s than the true sums.

since we wish to compare s

take into account nite-size eects. paragraph 2.2 showed that the quantity k/(22

3.4 conditional probabilities.

suppose that the curve c of the previous section is the disjoint union of two curves c1
and c2. then the space of distributions on c is the product of the space on c1 and the
space on c2. we x the model to be the ising model at criticality on the square lattice and
denote a distribution by  and the measure whose meaning was claried in the previous
paragraph by md,c(). then, in principle, the conditional probability md,c(1|2) on the
set of distributions on c1 is dened for each distribution 2 on c2. whether this is so is not
so easy to test experimentally. to approximate the conditional probability numerically with
our methods we have to choose a neighborhood u of 2 and proceed as before, eliminating
from the sample all distributions  = (1, 2) for which 2 does not fall in u. we recall
that i is a distribution given by a sum of -functions on ci. first of all, the neighborhood
u is a neighborhood in an innite-dimensional space, so that it is going to be, in any case,
very large. secondly, we cannot eliminate too many distributions for then the samples would
be far too small. thus u is going to have to be enormous. the notion seems nevertheless
to be workable even at a coarse experimental level.

there are two properties that one might expect. we can introduce and study experimen-
tally the measure on the distributions on c1 obtained when the spins on c2, or in a small
neighborhood of it, are all taken to be +1. this of course presupposes some kind of compat-
ibility of c2 with the lattice structure, as in the examples studied where c2 passes through a
row of sites, or some way, either theoretical or practical, of specifying the neighborhood, but
granted this, we consider the measure md,c1(1|c2, +) obtained from this familiar condition.
it is dened quite dierently than the conditional probability md,c(1|0) for 2  0. (see

35

figure 15: congurations on cylinders.

paragraph 5.2.) none the less, one could hope that they were equal. the experiments to
be described are too coarse to establish this with any degree of certainty, but do render the
expectation plausible.

the second property is the markovian property. suppose that c1 is the disjoint union of
c3 and c4, so that 1 is a pair (3, 4). suppose moreover  this is the essential condition 
that c2 separates c3 from c4. then one can hope that conditioning the measure md,c(1|2)
on 4 leads to a measure md,c(3|4|2) that is equal to md,c(3|2), thus the measure on
the distributions on c3 when the distributions on c2 and c4 are given is independent of the
distribution on c4. the inuence of the distribution 4 is not propagated across c2 when
the distribution on c2 is xed.

we begin by examining figure 15 in which three typical states are shown, from left
to right: free boundary conditions on a cylinder of circumference 199 and length 31; free
boundary conditions on a cylinder of circumference 199 and length 399; and free boundary
conditions on the left but + boundary conditions on the right on a cylinder of circumference
199 and length 31. the picture in the center is the familiar one: towards the middle there is
a tendency to form very large clusters of constant sign, indeed there is only one very large
(white) cluster but at the boundary the clusters are smaller. recall as well that for a cylinder
there is conformal distortion. in figure 9 the phenomenon is illustrated without distortion:
there is one large (white) cluster on the left and one large (black) one on the right. in the
picture on the left of figure 15, the freedom to form smaller clusters is reinforced by the
proximity of the two boundaries. there is almost no bulk behavior at all. on the other
hand, in the picture on the right, the boundary condition is forcing a single large cluster on
the right and this cluster is attempting to envelop the left boundary as well.

this qualitative description is conrmed by a calculation, for the measures on the distri-
butions on the left boundaries, of the numbers k introduced in paragraph 2.2. the results
are plotted in the diagrams of figure 16 for the measure associated to the left boundary in
the three cases. in clockwise order from the upper left, they are: free boundary conditions
on a cylinder of size 199  31; free boundary conditions on a cylinder of size 199  399;
in
boundary conditions on the left free, those on the right constant, and size 199  31.

the diagram on the lower left, they are superposed. the graph in the upper right is like
those of figure 2, except that we have used new statistics with a smaller sample, so that
the graph is somewhat irregular. all graphs are pretty much the same except for the rst
four or ve values of k. as far as the higher values of k are concerned the two boundaries
are eectively at an innite distance from each other. for k = 1, there is a pronounced
dierence between the graphs so that the distribution of a1 on the short cylinder is atter
than on the long cylinder. on the other hand, when the boundary condition is imposed the
value of k increases and the distribution of a1 is peaked. the superposition of the three
curves is shown in figure 17.
we now take c1 to be the left boundary of a cylinder of aspect ratio 199/31 and c2 to be
the right boundary. to test the assertion that md,c1(1|c2, +) is the conditional probability
md,c(1|0), we thermalize for free boundary conditions at both ends of a cylinder of size
199  31 but only keep those samples for which

|a2| < .22,
|a2| < .22,

|a3| < .353,
|a3| < .353.

|a1| < .125,
|a1| < .125,

(24)

(25)

about 3 out of every 10,000 states satisfy this condition. so our crude experiments will
not permit a substantially smaller neighborhood of 0. in figure 18, we plot the resulting
collection of k together with those obtained from the previous experiment with + boundary
conditions on the right side. we see that in spite of the large size of the neighborhood, the
two graphs are quite close.
it is the values of 1 and 2 that tell. the graphs of the
distributions of a1 are compared in figure 19 to ensure that not only are the variances
close but also the probability measures themselves. without being at all conclusive, the
experiment encourages the belief that

md,c(1|0) = md,c1(1|c2, +).

scribed in the text. at the center the curves are in the order, from top to bottom: short
cylinder with constant spins on the right, long cylinder, short cylinder with both sides free.

in order to test whether the probabilities are markovian we considered on the one hand
a cylinder of size 199  31 on which we thermalized, keeping only the distributions that on
the right boundary satised the conditions

|a1| <.125,
.3  a1  1,

|a2| < .22,
|a2| < .22,

|a3| < .353,
|a3| < .353.

(26)

on the other hand we considered a cylinder of size 199  61 on which we thermalized with
spin + as the boundary condition on the right and then selected only those states satisfying
the conditions (26) on the distributions for the central meridian. we then examined the
resulting measure on the distributions on the left boundary, in particular the distribution of
a1 and a1. the markovian hypothesis asserts that, when we x the distribution on the
center, the measure on the distributions on the left boundary is completely shielded from the
boundary conditions on the right, although once again we are prevented by the necessity of
allowing the rather large open neighborhood (26) from actually xing the distribution on the
center. we can only impose very crude constraints on the rst few fourier coecients. for
the experiments on the smaller cylinder about 3 samples in 10,000 are kept; on the larger,
curiously enough, about 1 in 1,000.

in figure 20 the k are plotted and compared once again, on the left those for ak, on
the right those for ak. for a1 the value of 1 is slightly larger for the broader cylinder;
the other values are very close. for a1 the value is smaller for the narrower cylinder,
and the other values are again very close. in figure 21 a similar comparison is made of the
distributions of a1 on the left and of a1 on the right. as is to be expected from conditions
26, the distribution of a1 is shifted to the right. it is more shifted for the narrow cylinder

though it is hard to imagine that experiments as coarse as these could ever successfully
refute the hypothesis because some shielding is inevitable. the question is rather how much.

4 crossings.

4.1 events and the two hypotheses.

crossings are one of the main order parameters for percolation models. consider, for exam-
ple, a rectangle covered by a regular lattice. a conguration is xed when each vertex has
been declared open or closed and this conguration has a crossing if it is possible to move
on open sites joined by lattice bonds from the left side of the rectangle to the right one. a
probability is usually dened on the set of all congurations by xing the probability p that
a site is open, so that a site is then, of course, closed with probability 1p. the probabilities
for each site are independent but equal. in the limit of mesh length zero, the probability of
such horizontal crossing is known (rigorously) to have a singular behavior as a function of
p, being 0 for p < pc and 1 for p > pc, for a certain constant pc  (0, 1) that depends on
the lattice. this denition can be extended readily to the ising model by replacing crossings
on open sites by crossings on spins of a given sign, say, for example, of positive sign. the
probability of crossings on clusters of + spins is not a familiar order parameter for the ising
model, and it is not even clear that it is not trivial, thus identically 1 or identically 0. we
examined it, at rst, only out of idle curiosity, following a suggestion of haru pinson and
were somewhat astonished to discover that it is far from trivial. with hindsight, it does
have some immediately appealing features and has been studied before although not with
the same goals [ksc]. it is related to spontaneous magnetization and to the geometry of
the main cluster. it even turns out to share striking properties of the percolation crossings:
universality and conformal invariance [lps]. whether a formula for it analogous to that of
cardy [c2] for percolation remains an open question. we recall the denitions.

let d be a domain and d a closed subset of d. let  = {(1, 2), . . . , (2n1, 2n)} and
 = {(1, 2), . . . , (2m1, 2m)} be sets of n and m pairs of intervals in the boundary of d
such that the 2(m + n) intervals are pairwise disjoint. (in fact, the intervals need not be in
the boundary of d but these are the only cases we treated.) let a lattice g be superimposed
upon the domain d. let  be a conguration for the ising model (g, j) on d and  its
restriction to d. we shall say that the event e specied by the data (d, d, , ) occurs
for the conguration 
(i)

if for every pair (2i1, 2i), i = 1, . . . , n, there is a connected cluster of + spins for 
that intersects both 2i1 and 2i
 that intersects both 2j1 and 2j.

(ii) and if for no pair (2j1, 2j), j = 1, . . . , m, is there a connected cluster of + spins for

(for percolation the denition of an event is simpler as the introduction of the larger domain
d is superuous, so that the measure on the congurations on d is independent of the choice
of d. thus one takes d = d.) let ga be the lattice g shrunk by the factor a and let (g,j),a
be the probability of the event e = (d, d, , ) for the ising model (ga, j) at its critical
point, then (g,j)

will be dened as

e

(g,j)
e = lim

if the limit exists. the two hypotheses of universality and conformal invariance are then
identical to those proposed in [lps] for percolation.

exists an element g of gl(2, r) such that

(27)

hypothesis of conformal invariance: let (g(cid:3), j(cid:3)) be the ising model on the square
lattice with critical coupling j(cid:3). let  be a map satisfying the same requirements as in the
hypothesis of conformal invariance of section 3. then

(g(cid:3) ,j(cid:3))

= (g(cid:3) ,j(cid:3))

(28)

it is best to observe explicitly that the map  acts on both d and d, so that if d is
the whole plane there are very few admissible . the following two paragraphs describe
simulations done to examine these hypotheses when d = d (paragraph 4.2) or d   d
(paragraph 4.3).

4.2 d = d.
for the rst events to be considered we take d = d. their description is simple when the
geometry of d is that of a rectangle. we introduce the notation h(r) and v(r), instead
of e, for events e occuring on d, a rectangle with aspect ratio r = width/height, with
a single pair (1, 2) and an empty . for the probability of horizontal crossings h the
two intervals 1 and 2 are the left and right sides and for the probability v of vertical
crossings, the top and bottom. the probability hv(r) will give an example of an event with
two pairs  = {(1, 2), (3, 4)}. it is the probability of having simultaneously horizontal
and vertical crossings in a rectangle d of aspect ratio r. note that the number h(r)hv(r)
is the probability to have a horizontal crossing without having a vertical one. it thus provides
an example of event e with one pair  and one pair . finally we introduce a
v (r)
whose corresponding events have a single pair (1, 2). for a
h , 1 is the vertical segment
splitting the rectangle in two parts of equal areas and 2 the right side. for a
v , 1 is
the horizontal segment in the middle of the rectangle and 2 the top side. for these two
probabilities, we could also have taken d to be the half-rectangle bounded by {1, 2}
because a path joining 2 to 1 reaches 1 before it leaves this half-rectangle, so that the
sites outside the half-rectangle are superuous.

h (r) and a

two diculties limit the precision of the numerical measurements. the rst one is the
limitation due to a choice of convention and was discussed at length in [lpps]. since (g,j)
are approximated by measurements on nite lattices, the exact position of the domain d
with respect to the lattice must be specied by convention; or, equivalently, a prescription
must be given for calculating r for a rectangle with lh sites in the horizontal direction and
lv in the vertical one. to examine the sensitivity to convention consider an extreme case.
suppose that in convention i the width is that of the narrowest rectangle containing the lh
horizontal sites and that in convention ii, the width is that of the widest. for the square
lattice oriented so that its bonds are parallel to the sides of the rectangles, the dierence
between the two widths is 2 mesh units. if both conventions measure the height in the same

e

42

way, the discrepancy for h between the two conventions is

2
lv |h(r)|,

the prime denoting a derivative. these numbers can be estimated from the data of table vi.
table iv gives an order of magnitude for this limitation on precision for the two probabilities
h and a
h at the center (r = 1) and at the extremities (r = 0.1361 and 7.353) of the range
of the aspect ratio we measured. our conventions are given in the appendix; whatever they
are, the above limitation is unavoidable.

to conrm the conformal invariance we also measure all these probabilities for comparable
geometries on the disk and the cylinder. the schwarz-christoel map can be chosen so that
the four vertices of the rectangle of aspect ratio r correspond to the four points ei for
some   [0, 
2 , r = 1 to
 = 
4 and r =  to  = 0. the slope of the function (r) at r = 0 is zero. this means
that the sensitivity to convention is magnied for values of  close to /2. for example
we measured the probabilities  in the rectangular geometry for ve dierent values of r in
the range [0.1361, 0.1647] . the corresponding range of  is [1.57051, 1.57076] and, on the
disk of radius r = 300.2 mesh units that we used, at most one site can be contained along
the boundary in this interval. this is even worse for the corresponding geometry on the
cylinder of size 397  793 where the s have also been measured. such measurements are
too imprecise to be useful and we measured the probabilities, on the disk and the cylinder,
only for the s corresponding to the forty-one values in the middle of the eighty-one we used
for the rectangular geometry. the arc between the two smallest as well as the two largest s
among these 41 values is about 3.7 mesh units. since we have taken the sites in the angles
(  ,  + ), (, ) to dene the pair of intervals (1, 2), it is clear that a rather large
systematic error is to be expected.
finite-size eects are the origin of the second diculty. fortunately the relation h(r) +
v(r) = 1 is veried for the triangular lattice, even for nite ones. this is a well-known
identity for percolation and the argument for its validity here is the same. for the other
pairs (g, j), this relation is not veried for nite lattices, that is (g,j),a
6= 1.
nevertheless, if universality holds, it should be satised for the other pairs (g, j) in the limit

squares with 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 sites along their edges.) the slope is 0.437 and unlikely
to be universal. the crossing probabilities h and v on the square lattice for the square
(r = 1) of size 200  200 were measured to be 0.4963 and 0.4964. the gap is of order of
3.5  103, comparable to the value of 2h(r)/lv at this point. note nally that, even
though h(r) + v(r) = 1 holds for nite rectangular subsets of the triangular lattice, it does
not follow that h(r) is equal to (lh,lv )
and
(lh,lv )
v

as nite-size eects could alter both (lh,lv )

while keeping their sum equal to 1.

the ve plots in figures 23 to 25 show all the data available: the probabilities for 81
values of the aspect ratio for the rectangles and 41 for the disk and the cylinder. for the
rectangles, 4 dierent ising models were studied: the three regular lattices with isotropic
coupling and the square lattice with the anisotropic coupling used in section 3. each gure
contains therefore six sets of measurements, four for the rectangles, one for the disk and one
for the cylinder. the cylinder is treated as though it were innitely long and the crossings are
from an interval on one end to another disjoint interval of the same length on the same end,
the intervals being chosen so that their position on the cylinder is conformally equivalent
to that of two opposite sides on a rectangle. because of the large amount of information

on these gures, the error bars were not drawn. some of the 95% condence intervals for
the measurements of h were listed on table iv and the dierence of the extreme values of
these intervals is equal to 0.07 at r = 0.136, 0.02 at r = 1.000 and 0.07 at r = 7.351 for the
variable log h/(1  h) that appears in figure 23. (for the square lattice, the condence
intervals on the probabilities are a factor 15
smaller since the sample was 5 times larger.)
the vertical dimension of the dots on this gure is approximately 0.065 and thus comparable
to the statistical errors or larger than them.

in all the gures, one sees clearly some spreading of the data at the two extremities of the
range of r. the data for the disk and for the cylinder also fall slightly beside those for the
rectangles around the extreme values of their range (log r  1). these small discrepancies
can all be explained by the above two limitations. first, for all the pairs (g, j) but the
isotropic triangular lattice, the quantity 1  h  v is less than one. it is thus likely that
nite-size eects tend to decrease both h and v. since for log r  2, one of the linear
dimensions of the rectangle is half what it is around log r  0, the values of h and v
should be spread more at the extremities than at the center of the range of r; and ()
should be the largest of all measurements. this is what is observed though the spread is
noticeable only when the small linear dimension is in the direction of the crossing. second,
by keeping the sites inside the sector ((r), (r)) or ( (r),  + (r)), the number of sites
(necessarily integral) is underestimated, leading to probabilities lower than what universality
would predict. this is again what is observed. but these discrepancies are rather small. as
can be seen from the gures the agreement is remarkable.

h

only for the isotropic ising model on the square lattice is (lh,lv )
. it is then sucient to measure the ve probabilities h, v, hv, a

strictly equal to
(lv,lh)
v for 41 values
v
of r to cover the same range. we proted from this coincidence and substantially increased
the sample in order to measure the probabilities with very high accuracy. in this case each
sample contained at least one million congurations. for the other models we used samples
of at least 200000 congurations. as can be seen from table iv, even the smaller sample
size yields statistical errors at worst of the same order of magnitude as the sensitivity to
conventions. table vi lists the crossing probabilities h, v, hv, a

ising model on the square lattice; table vii lists them for the triangular lattice. this table
gives an idea of both the dierence between the various probabilities as measured for two
dierent ising models and the isotropy of the probabilities: the pairs (h, v) and (a
h , a
v )
are approximately symmetric under the exchange of r  r1 even though the lattice is not
invariant under a rotation of

the data for the ising model behave similarly. we used those for the triangular lattice since
they respect closely the relation h(r) + v(r) = 1. we rejected the ten points at both
extremities of the spectrum of r because they carry the largest nite-size eect. the 30
remaining points with largest r were tted to log h(r)  a + br and the 30 with smallest r
were tted to log(1  h(r))  c + d/r. the ts appear in figure 26. the constants b and d
turned out to be 0.1672 and 0.1664. a natural guess for both constants is /6.

we measured the crossing probabilities from one curve ci to another one cj on the cylinder,
0  i < j  4, and for the corresponding congurations on the disk. (the curves ci have
been introduced in section 3.) the simulations were done on the cylinder with 397  793
sites and on the disk of radius 300.2 mesh units. the results are tabulated in table v. in
each cell the number on top is the probability for the disk, the one on the bottom that for the
cylinder and, again, the vertical bar | is used as in section 2 to give the statistical errors.
the agreement is convincing even though the probabilities for the disk are systematically
larger than those for the cylinders. again the geometries of the disk and the cylinder are
not quite conformally equivalent. only if the cylinder is innitely long can one hope to have

47

perfect agreement. since the relative gap increases as the two curves ci and cj move closer
to the middle of the cylinder, the shortness of the cylinder is a likely explanation for the
discrepancy.

since the numbers of table v are all close to 1., one more example of crossing probability
was measured. the event e for the cylinder (= d) is given by the following data: the domain
d is delimited by the curve c2 and the right-hand side of the cylinder and 1 and 2 are
the two intervals on c2 that correspond to the forty-seventh value of the aspect ratio r
considered in the previous paragraph (r = 1.35). the data for the disk are the conformal
images of those of the cylinder. for the disk and the cylinders the numbers e are 0.412|1
and 0.4096|6 respectively.

table v: crossing probabilities from one curve ci to another cj for the disk and the cylinder.

another interesting choice is d   d = r2. that means measuring crossings on domains
d in the bulk. we have seen that the bulk
are larger than those at the boundary by
approximately a factor of 3. the corresponding variances 2
k are consequently smaller and
the number of large clusters intersecting the central meridians of the cylinder is also smaller.
are there enough of them to break crossings? or is bulk
(r) a trivial function, namely equal
to 1

2 for all r?
such a measurement would amount, in an ideal situation, to thermalizing an innite
lattice z2 and then measuring crossings on nite d inside this lattice. only the usual
limitations (convention and nite size of d) would then have to be dealt with. to do the
actual simulations, the rst idea is to truncate d to a nite though large lattice and to
choose d as the largest domain possible inside a region in which the behavior of the spins

h

k

48

is as close as possible to the bulk behavior. with our present computers, a lattice size of
practical use contains about 106 sites. if r2 is approximated by a square lattice, then it
would be of size 1000  1000. the domains d used in paragraph 4.2 contained around
40000 sites and the domain d with r = 1 was therefore 200  200. if we compare these
sizes with disks, as we are interested only in orders of magnitude, the boundary of d would
correspond to a circle of radius one fth that of d. the distribution md,d on the boundary
of d is approximately equivalent to that of a circle at a distance of 100 mesh units from
the boundary of the cylinder 397  793. figure 13 (paragraph 3.2) shows that the rst four
fourier coecients are still far from their bulk distribution. these coecients are precisely
those measuring the large clusters responsible for creating crossings or for breaking them.

r ), can be used to quantify this symmetry breaking.

but as we have seen (paragraph 3.2), the middle of a long cylinder provides a better
approximation to bulk behavior. so we conne our experiments to cylinders. if a square d
of size 200  200 is located in the middle of a cylinder of size about 397  793 as before, its
distance from the boundary is about 300 mesh units and its spins behave essentially as in
the bulk as can be seen in figure 13. this choice has one possible drawback. it spoils the
symmetry between horizontal and vertical directions. the mean width of the largest cluster
is surely not equal to its mean height on a long cylinder. fortunately a simple quantity,
h(r)  v( 1
to enforce the relation h(r)+v(r) = 1, we took the measurements on triangular lattices
with 426737 and 8521475 sites, the 737 and 1475 sites being in the longitudinal direction.
on these lattices, the crossings h, v and hv were measured on rectangles with the 81 aspect
ratios r used before. to keep the rectangles safely in the bulk, we used domains d with
approximately 10000 sites. (we used the same domains on both cylinders. see below.) the
longest rectangle (r  7.3) has 40  253 sites and its distance from the boundary, for the
cylinder of size 426737, is similar to that of the square of size 200200 square in a cylinder
of size 397 793 discussed above. the highest rectangle (r  0.13) has 293 34 sites and its
height takes up more than 2
3 of the circumference of the smaller lattice, possibly too large
a fraction if the symmetry breaking is important. the larger lattice helps to address this
question. we also measure the crossings h, v and hv inside a disk of radius 100.2 whose
center is within one mesh unit from the central meridian of the cylinders. note that the
hypothesis of conformal invariance stated above does not relate the crossings in the bulk on
the rectangles and on the disk. as emphasized, the map  must act on both d and d and
there is no conformal map from the plane (d) to the plane taking a rectangle (d) to a disk.
figures 27 and 28 present the results. squares ((cid:3)) were used for the crossings on rect-
angles and circles () for those on the disk. white symbols are for the 426 737 lattice and
black for the 852  1475. the two samples were 895000 for the 426  737 cylinder and and
227000 for the 852  1475. even though these data look almost identical to those presented
in paragraph 4.2 (figures 23 and 24), the vertical scale is dierent. when d = d, h ranges
from 0.02 to 0.98 as r decreases from 7.3 to 0.14. here, in the bulk, h goes from 0.23 to
0.76 for the same interval of r.

there is a denite breaking of the horizontal-vertical symmetry. the graph of hv for
the cylinder with 426  737 sites is clearly asymmetrical. for the rectangles the quantities
h(r) and v( 1
r ) that should be equal if the symmetry was present dier by about 6% for r
large or small and by 1% for r  1. for the measurements on the disk their departure from

symmetry varies from 3% to 7%. for both cases, rectangles and disk, the vertical crossings
are always larger than the corresponding horizontal ones. large clusters wrapping around
the circumference are more likely than clusters having about the same number of sites but
that fail to surround the cylinder simply because the former have fewer peripheral sites than
the latter. this dierence seems to play a role here. if this is so, a better measurement of
the s would therefore be obtained by, say, doubling the linear dimensions of the cylinder
while keeping the number of sites in the domains d unchanged. this is why we studied
the larger 852  1475 cylinder. for this new experiment, the asymmetry is essentially gone.
for example most of the quantities h(r) and v( 1
r ) dier now by less than 0.5%. still the
data for the two lattices remain very close and experiments with smaller cylinders show that
the curves in figures 27 and 28 do not change much with lattice size, so that we can assert
with some condence that the crossing probabilities in the bulk are well dened as the mesh
goes to zero, in other words, the crossing probabilities are dened even when d is the whole
plane. the data, especially those for the 852  1475 cylinder, must represent a very good
approximation to the crossing probabilities in the bulk for the rectangles and the disk.
in particular, the curves for the crossings on the rectangles and on the disk are now
distinct and their dierence does not seem to be due to the limitation of the experiments.
there was in fact no reason at all to compare them or to use the parameter r to describe
the arcs on the disk, for it pertains to a conformal transformation r from the disk to the
rectangle of aspect ratio r that is no longer pertinent. nevertheless, it does appear that
rectangle
(r) for r < 1, inequalities
v
for which we have no very persuasive explanation. for each r, the map r extends to a
conformal equivalence r of a double covering r1(r) of the plane, or rather of the riemann
sphere, ramied at four points with a torus r2(r). figure 29 represents r1 and r2 and their
corresponding neighborhoods. only one sheet of r1 is depicted here; the other is identical,

singular points on the unit circle , , and . the cuts were drawn along the unit
circle. consequently the neighborhood to the left of the domain 2 on the rst sheet is the
domain 6 on the second. the thicker lines on r2 are not cuts but circumscribe the images
of the disks on r1. the top and bottom sides of the whole rectangle are identied as are the
left and the right. both r1 and r2 are tori. the conformal class of r1 and r2 depends on
r. the hypothesis of conformal invariance does apply to diskr1(r)

5 cylinders of variable length and the phase.

the key to the introduction of critical exponents appears to be the analogue for the eld
h of the variable x dened in paragraph 2.1 for the free boson . we refer to this variable
as the phase. though supercial our examination indicates clearly that the measures md,
generalized to take into account the phase x, reproduce some of the exponents of the classical
ising model.

the variable x for the boson eld measures the dierence between the constant terms
in 1 and 2, the restrictions of  to the two boundaries of the cylinder. it takes its values
in the interval [0, 2r) where r is the radius of compactication. (see paragraph 2.1.) an
analogue for the ising model on the cylindrical lv  lh square lattice g(cid:3) is dened using

x =

1

lv xp

(h(p + )  h(p))

where  is the unit vector in the horizontal direction and the sum runs over all sites p in the
lattice that have a right neighbor. because the jumps of h are chosen at random between
, it is natural to study the distribution of

x = x mod 2

instead of x. the normalization of x is such that a closed curve of discontinuity in h that
wraps around the cylinder, in other words that is noncontractible, gives a contribution of 
to x. clusters intersecting the boundary contribute /lv to x where  is the numbers
of boundary sites inside the cluster. however contractible curves surrounding clusters of
constant spins not intersecting the boundary do not contribute.
in section 2 we introduced, for the cylinder d, the measure

md({ak},{bk}) = lim
n

lim
a0

ma,n
d ({ak},{bk})

dened on the space hi with coordinates ({ak},{bk}), k  z \ {0}. as we observed in
paragraph 3.3, this can also be regarded as a measure md(1, 2) on a space of distributions,
one 1 on the circle at one end of the cylinder and one 2 on the circle at the other end. we
could as well have dened

md(1, 2, x) = md({ak},{bk}, x) = lim
n

lim
a0

ma,n
d ({ak},{bk}, x)

taking the variable x into account. the probability md(1, 2) is a conditional probability,
thus  speaking imprecisely  we have integrated over the variable x. writing all measures
informally as measures absolutely continuous with respect to a lebesgue measure on the
underlying spaces, we express this as

dmd({ak},{bk}) = dmd(1, 2) = zd(1, 2) d1 d2

with

this is a convenient notation that avoids technical explanations about conditional probabil-
ities and also reminds us of the connection between the measures and partition functions.

zd(1, 2) =z 2

zd(1, 2, x) dx.

5.1 the measure mq(x).

we rst consider dmq(x) = dmd(x) = zq(x)dx, d = d(q), with

zq(x) =z zd({ak},{bk}, x)yk

dak dbk =z zd(1, 2, x) d1 d2,

the choice between the three notations ({ak},{bk}), ({ak = ikak},{bk = ikbk}) and (1, 2)
being a matter of convenience. we shall parametrize by the variable q the cylinder d in the
plane of length la, l = ln(1/q), and circumference 2a, with a arbitrary. it is mapped to
an annulus the ratio of whose inner and outer radii is q by z  exp(z/a). the measure is
normalized

z 2

0

zq(x) dx = 1

and its fourier expansion is

zq(x) =

1
2

+xk6=0

k(q)eikx.

we can try to expand each coecient in a series of powers of q

k(q) =

xj=0

ck(j)qj .

we expect from the original calculations on the ising model or from arguments of conformal
eld theory that 0 = 0, although we admit ck(0) = 0, and that 1 = 1
8. the remaining
j should be at least 5
8. (the usual argument of conformal eld theory would select the
exponents 0, 1
8 and 1, and all those diering from these by two positive units, but it requires
unitarity. it is not yet clear to us to what extent unitarity is pertinent in the present context.
the whole kac spectrum could intervene  at least our experiments are not ne enough to
rule out  = 5

8 which is smaller than  = 1.)

we have run two sets of experiments to measure the smallest exponent in 1(q), one for
lv = 59, the other for lv = 117. as q  0, that is for long cylinders, the graph of zq
0.
is practically of period , instead of 2, and the odd fourier coecients c2k+1(q) q0
the physical reason for this behavior is that, for very long cylinders, several noncontractible
curves of jumps in h are likely to occur and congurations with an even or an odd number
of these curves will arise in approximately the same numbers. figure 30 shows, for the long
cylinder of size 117801, the distribution of the variable x (before the identication x  x+
2) and of the variable x. the peaks for x are centered on the integer multiples of , clearly
underlining the role of noncontractible curves of jumps. the gure shows congurations
with n curves, |n| = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and the data also indicate that |n| = 5 and 6 were obtained
in the sample of 1.6  106 congurations. even for |n| = 4 the probability is fairly large.
it should be remembered that only 1
16 of the congurations with 4 noncontractible curves
will contribute to the peak around 4. the distribution mq(x) is, for this cylinder, almost
perfectly periodic of period .

figure 31 is a log-log plot of 1 as a function of q. the data for the cylinders with
lv = 59 are marked by  and those with lv = 117 by +. the shortest cylinders were
59 27 and 117 53. we measured several other longer cylinders for both lv s. we decided
to discard for both the gure and the ts the measurements of 1 whose 95% condence
interval was more than 5% of the measurement itself.3 the linear ts of the log-log pairs
give a slope of 0.12506 for lv = 59 and of 0.12478 for lv = 117. the line on the gure is
the latter t. the value 1 = 1
8 appears clearly. we did not check its universality but there
is no reason to doubt it.

5.2 the ratio z+(q)/z++(q).
let z++(q) and z+(q) be the relative probabilities that with constant boundary conditions
on a cylinder of parameter q the spins are equal at opposite ends or unequal. there is a
well-known formula due to cardy [c1],

z+(q)
z++(q)

=

1(q)  22(q)
1(q) + 22(q)

1(q) = ym>0, m odd

2 )2k/2lv ) and pi are the
frequencies for the 2lv bins in which the data are distributed. we use ni for the number of data in the
i-th bin and n for the sample size. hence pi = ni/n . since the distribution of the ni is a multinomial
mult(n ; n1, n2, . . . , n2lv 1), the rst moments are hnii = n pi and hninji = n (n  1)pipj + n piij .
therefore var(k) = 1

we could, in experiments, x the spins along one or both of the two ends of the cylinder
to be constant. this leads to alternative measures mq({bk}, x), in which the spins at the left
end are taken to be +1, and (z+(q), z++(q)). the question arises whether

mq({bk}, x) = mq({ak = 0},{bk}, x)

(30)

and whether

z++(q)0 + z+(q) = mq({ak = 0},{bk = 0}, x).

(31)
these two equations require some explanation. the measure mq({ak = 0},{bk = 0}, x)
is understood, in so far as it can be assumed to exist, to be the conditional probability
dened by the probability measure mq({ak},{bk}, x), the conditions being ak = bk = 0, or
equivalently ak = bk = 0, k  z \ {0}. experimentally this means that it is a distribution
that we approximate just as we approximate mq({ak},{bk}, x) itself except that we discard
all samples for which the restrictions h1 and h2 at the ends of the cylinder do not lie in
a suitably chosen neighborhood of 0. the neighborhood is thus to be as small as possible
but large enough that we do not reject so many samples that the number of useful samples
becomes impossibly small. we dene mq({ak = 0},{bk}, x) in the same manner, but the
condition is now that ak = 0, k  z \ {0}.
if (31) is valid the distribution dened by

z|ak|<ckz|bk|<ck

zq({ak},{bk}, x)yk

dakdbk

(32)

with suciently small cks should be approximately a(q)0 + b(q), thus a sum of two -
functions with coecients whose ratio b/a is given by (29). similarly the distribution

z|ak|<ck

zq({ak}, x)yk

58

dak

(33)

provides another ratio b/a to be compared with (29).

measuring these two ratios b/a is dicult. the ratio z+/z++ decreases from 1 at q = 0
to 0 at q = 1. large ratios z+/z++, those easier to measure, correspond therefore to long
cylinders. for these the variables ak and bk are independent and their distributions are
known from previous sections. the eect of the constraints can therefore be estimated by
using rk = probq=0(|ak| < ck). even by imposing restrictions |ak| < ck and |bk| < ck only
for k = 1, 2, 3, leaving the other variables free, a choice of r1 = r2 = r3  0.1 cuts the
number of admissible congurations by a factor of one million for the measurement of (32)
and the measurement is impracticable. for shorter cylinders (q  1), the ratio z+/z++
drops quickly. for a circumference four times the length, the ratio is less than 2
1000 , again
dicult to measure. we limited ourselves to a small window of r = l/2, choosing six values
corresponding to values of q increasing by a factor of approximately 4 at each step. table
viii gives the values of r, q, the (rather small) lattices we used and cardys prediction. the
ratios b/a were measured for the constraints:

c1  0.377

c2  0.653

c3  0.929,

(34)

the others being innite. these numbers correspond to the following probabilities

prob(|a1| < c1) = 0.2

prob(|a2| < c2) = 0.3

prob(|a3| < c3) = 0.4

if the cylinder were of size 79  157 like the one used in section 2. for this long cylinder
and these constraints applied at both extremities, only a fraction (0.2 0.3 0.4)2  0.0006
of the congurations would be used. we observed that for the shorter cylinders of table
viii more congurations passed the test. the diculty of getting proper samples for the
measurment of (33) is of course less acute.

table viii. ratios b/a measured for several cylinders.

three sets of measurements were taken. for the rst set the constraints given by (34)
were applied at both extremities of the cylinders and is thus of the form (32). in table viii
it is refered to as const/const for constrained. for the second they were applied at one
extremity while the spins at the other were forced to be the same though they were allowed
to ip simultaneously during the swendsen-wang upgrades. this corresponds to (33) and
is refered to as const/xed. the last set is the measurement of the ratio z+/z++, that is
the case xed/xed. for each lattice enough congurations (> 20 million in each case) were

generated so that at least 30000 contributed to the integral (32). far larger samples were
obtained for the two other sets.

because of the small sample, especially in the case (32), large statistical variations are
expected between neighboring bins and smoothing provides an ecient tool to identify the
two local maxima around x =  and x = 0 whose ratio was used as a measurement of
b/a. these measurements appear in the last lines of table viii. (smoothing was done as
in paragraph 2.2. the smoothing parameter was chosen as if the distribution of x were
approximately the sum of two gaussians centered at  = 0 and  = . the ratios b/a did
not seem to be very sensitive to the exact choice of the smoothing parameter. of course the
case xed/xed does not require any smoothing since the distribution is actually of the form
a(q)0 + b(q).) the measurements for constrained/constrained and constrained/xed are
systematically larger than the predicted values though they are very close, in fact closer for
longer cylinders than for shorter ones.

it is useful to see how the choice of constraints changes the measured ratios b/a and
whether the distribution of the variable x is at all similar to the proposed sum a0 + b.
for the cylinder 79  52 we compared four sets of constraints for the measurement of (32).
the rst set consisted of no constraint at all, that is all the cks were innite. the second
was the one used before and the nite cks for the third and fourth sets were

these cks correspond to r1 = 0.1, r2 = 0.3, r3 = 0.4 and r1 = 0.1, r2 = 0.15, r3 = 0.2, r4 =
0.25. for the fourth set only 3152 congurations were admissible out of the 200 millions
generated and they were distributed in the 2lv = 632 bins. errors are large in this case.
instead of smoothing as before we compared the four sets by expanding their histograms in

fourier series keeping only the rst ten terms. the ratios b/a are sensitive to the number of
terms kept. only the rst two digits of the ratios given below, at the end of this paragraph,
are reliable. the smoothed distributions are shown on figure 32. if the distribution goes
to a0 + b as the constraints become more stringent then the peaks at 0 and  should be
narrower and the distribution around 
2 should go to zero as one goes to the rst to
the fourth set. this is what happens with the four curves. at 
2 the top curve is that with
no constraint and the one closer to zero corresponds to the fourth set of constraints. even
though the values of a and b for the three last sets are quite dierent, as they should be,
their ratios are strikingly close: 0.120, 0.109 and 0.114.

2 and 3

finally we compared the ratios b/a for the three lattices 79 52, 158 104 and 316 208
using always the constraints (34). the numbers of admissible congurations were 40409,
9931 and 8816 and the ratios b/a, obtained again after truncation of their fourier series, are
0.120, 0.129 and 0.130. these numbers are the same within the statistical errors though the
values of a and b are again dierent. figure 33 shows the three distributions, the sharper
peaks being for the smaller lattices. it seems that smaller cks are necessary for ner lattices
if the peaks are to be as sharp as for the coarse lattice.

it is not clear whether the above measurement technique can reproduce accurately the
ratios z+/z++ with a proper choice of the cks and the size of the lattice. the very
supercial analysis we have done does not indicate any decrease in the small gap appearing
in table viii for the short cylinders. still the measurements and the predictions are very
close.

unfortunately only the rst line carries any conviction. it may not be possible to measure

the measure dm0({ak}, x) = z0({ak}, x)dx may be of some interest, but we cannot oer

this function might be.

we observe that there is an inconsistency in [l] between the discrete and continuous hamil-
tonians. for consistency the denominator in (4.3) of that paper has to be replaced by 4.
we have used the formulas based on the continuous hamiltonian.

there are at least two properties of free elds that appear again in other models. either
might be chosen as a basis of comparison and a means of studying these models. the property
commonly chosen is the asymptotic behavior of correlation functions. in particular, in the
plane,

h((p)  (0))2i

where |p| is the distance between x and 0; and on a cylinder of circumference 2

if p and the origin 0 lie on the same generator and |p| is the distance between p and the
origin with respect to the metric that yields a circumference of 2. we shall briey recall
below the pertinent calculations. in the formula a is a constant that depends on the mesh.
it could approach innity as the mesh approaches zero.

another property is described in [l]. consider the partition function z() with boundary
conditions, either on a disk so that  is a function on the circle, dened however only modulo
constants, thus for simplicity with constant term 0, or on a cylinder, taken to be innitely
long, so that  is really a pair of functions 1, 2, and a constant x, taken modulo 2. in

covered by a square lattice.

thus, as far as the variable x is concerned, the measure is homogeneous, a behavior that
constrasts with that of the ising model discussed in the previous section.

for the ising model on a triangular lattice the sos-model constructed in section 2 is the
same as the sos-model attached, as in [n] for example, to the o(1)-model on a hexagonal
lattice,4 and for this model there are familiar arguments that suggest the behavior (40)
with g = gi = 4/3. we have not tested carefully the universality of the behavior or of
the constants. crude experiments for the square and the triangular lattice suggest that the
behavior is universal but we are not certain that the constants do not vary slightly.

the function  of the free-eld theory plays the same role as the function h of our
construction so that to test (40) we examine h(h(p)  h(0))2i. for what they are worth, the
results for the plane appear in figures 35 and 36 in which the value of

h(h(p)  h(0))2i  1.5 ln|p|

(44)

is plotted against |p|. for the square lattice in figures 35 the experiments are performed
in disks of radii 100 and 300, an edge of the lattice being taken in each case as unit. the
experiments are perhaps not to be taken too seriously because the nite size leads to an
ambiguity. not only are the states in a disk qualitatively dierent at the boundary from
those in the true bulk limit but also the jump lines that in a disk terminate at the boundary
could, in some sense, in the bulk turn and pass once again through the disk, so that working
in the disk increases the statistical independence. the graphs, in which vertical distances
are drawn at a much larger scale, suggest that the function is approximately constant except
close to the origin and near the edge of the disk, where the eect of the boundary manifests
itself. the constant to which one imagines the dierence (44) tending has not yet stabilized
in the diagrams. there is a dierence of about .4 in the minimum of the two curves. for

4in [n] the partition function for the o(1)-model is expressed as a sum over weighted closed curves in
the hexagonal lattice which is dual to the triangular lattice. every state of the ising model leads also to a
collection of closed curves, formed from the dual edges separating sites of dierent spin. the weight of the
collection can be taken as the mass of the set of ising states that lead to it.

figure 36: the quantity h(h(p) h(0))2i  1.5 ln|p| measured on a disk of radius 90 covered
by a triangular lattice.

comparison, a similar curve for the triangular lattice, obtained once again in a small disk of
radius 90, an edge of the lattice again being taken as unit, is shown in figure 36.

for the cylinder and the same two lattices, square and triangular, the graphs of h(h(p) 
h(0))2i appear in figures 37 and 38. we have not used the parameter |p| in the gures but
rather the parameter k because it is then easier to explain which part of the curve we used to
calculate the slope (for the square lattice |p| = 4k/lv , for the triangular |p| = 8k/3lv ).
none the less the data have been so normalized that if the behavior is, as in equation (41),
asymptotically a + b|p| then the slope of the curves in the gures on their middle, linear
parts and as functions of k is also b. for the square lattice the cylinder is of circumference
120 and length 2401 in lattice units; for the triangular of circumference 160 and length 1601.
the slope for the square lattice is about .460; for the triangular it is about .452, which is
not a number that we can deduce easily from 4/3. these numbers are close; so universality
of the slope is strongly suggested.

to obtain figures 37 and 38 we construct h as in sections 2 and 3 and use the dierence
between the values of h at points on generators of the cylinder symmetrically placed with
respect to the central meridian and at a distance of k sites from it. thus k is necessarily less
than one-half the length of the cylinder. since we use all generators there is considerable
statistical dependence. none the less this yields for a cylinder of size 1202401 a very regular
graph and if we use that part of it between 100 and 1100 we obtain a t 37.6275 + .4597k
from which the statistically generated values dier by no more than two units at any point
on this interval, so that the slope should be correct to about two parts in a thousand. (the
curve is in fact slightly concave and the departure from linearity regular. with a quadratic t
and a slightly shorter interval we would do much better with the t but not with the slope.)
the experiment repeated on the interval [200, 1000] leads to a slope of .4599 but the same
conclusions. a similar experiment for a cylinder of size 120 1201 yields to a slightly better

t and similar conclusions with a slope of .4593. an anisotropic lattice of size 78  2401 is
roughly conformally equivalent to a square lattice of size 120 2401. using the points on the
interval [200, 1200] we obtain a t of 39.8942 + .4519k from which the statistically generated
values dier by no more than 1.5 units. the dierence is again not random but not convex.
we can again conclude that the slope is correct to about two parts in a thousand. the
dierence between the slopes in the symmetric and the anisotropic cases is .0078. in other
words, it appears that we obtain the same constant. a triangular lattice of length 1601
and circumference 160 is conformally equivalent to a square lattice of circumference 120 and
length a little shorter than 1401. thus it is long enough. on using that part of figure 38
in the interval [100, 700] we obtain a t 20.6918 + .4515k that is as good as those for the
square and anisotropic lattice and suggests, for the same reasons, an error of two parts in a
thousand.

we observe nally that the experiments described in section 2, in which the analogue of

z() is studied, yield the behavior (42) and (43) with gb = 2r2

b = 1.4710 6= gi.

for the convenience of the reader, we recall briey the calculations that lead to (40)
and (41). the average h((p)  (0))2i is taken with respect to the measure dened by the
weights

  {(1, 0), (0,1)}.

we are calculating the second derivative of

z (exp(i()) exp ((q, )) d(cid:14)z exp ((q, )) d =  exp(cid:0)2(q1, )/4(cid:1)

with respect to the parameter , where  is the linear form   (p)  (0) or the function
p  0. the second derivative is

(q1, )/2.

this expression is easier to treat when we pass to fourier transforms. the two delta
functions of  can be written as integrals of eigenfunctions of q. since the operator q acts
on  so that (q)(p) is g/8 times

8(p)  2(p + (1, 0))  2(p  (1, 0))  2(p + (0, 1))  2(p  (0, 1)),

the constant 2/g is replaced by 1/g as in (41).

7 alternate constructions.

in this section, we examine briey other conventions and constructions that we could have
chosen in our experiments.

7.1 sos-model jumps.

if, as indicated in the introduction, the aim is simply to develop the circle onto the line,
thereby turning the ising model into an sos-model, the particular construction chosen is
somewhat arbitrary. we could, apparently with equally good reason, replace the jumps of
 by jumps from a set, {(2k + 1),(2k  1), . . . , (2k + 1)}, k  n, each choice being
assigned a probability on which the only conditions are that the sum of the probabilities is
one and that the probabilities of jumps by equal amounts in opposite directions are equal.
it is not, at rst, clear what eect this has.

thomas spencer pointed out to one of us that the behavior, for jumps of ,

h(h(p)  h(0))2i  3/2 ln|p|

is a consequence of a more geometric hypothesis. to construct the function h attached to a
particular state of the ising model, we construct curves separating the regions in which the
spins take dierent values. let, in the plane, n = n(p) be the number of curves separating
p from the origin. the hypothesis is that

since h(p) is then obtained by assigning independent values to the jumps of , it is clear
that cn must be 2/g2. for a cylinder the analogue of (50) is

hn(p)i  cn ln|p|.

(50)

hn(p)i  c|p|.

(51)

once again, out of curiosity, we tested this hypothesis numerically for the square lattice.
the results are presented in figure 39 in which hn(p)i/ ln|p| is plotted for the square lattice
it appears that except at the center and near the
and two disks of radii 200 and 300.
boundary the quotient is approximately constant but that it is only very approximately
equal to 3/22  .15199. there are several possible causes. as we saw in paragraph 3.2 the
bulk state is approached only slowly in a disk. moreover the nite-size eects that appear
in the examination of (44) appear here too. the rst consequence is that there will be a
tendency to overestimate the number n(p) when |p| is not small in comparison with the
radius because the curves in a disk that reach the boundary are not allowed to close. in
principle, this eect should, for a given |p|, be mitigated as the radius grows. on the other
hand, rather than increasing toward .15 as we pass from a radius of 200 to one of 300, the
minimum of the curve, decreases from about .14 to about .13. since the smallest pertinent
value of |p| is about 75 and ln(75)  4.3 and the dierence in (44) does not, as we saw in the
previous chapter, approach a limiting value rapidly, if it approaches one at all, a decrease in
the minimum of .4/4.32  .01 is not completely unreasonable. no conclusions are possible

without further study. our purpose here is not, however, to examine (50) but rather to
acquire a rough understanding of what we might have discovered if we had chosen the jumps
in a dierent way.

the advantage of (50) and (51) is that they make clear that the behavior (40) and (41)
does not change when the denition of h is modied. if there are jumps of (2k + 1) with
probability k, k  z, then (40) persists with a new constant

cn

xk=

k(2k + 1)2.

(52)

there is a similar change in (41).

the behavior of the functions z() appears to be quite dierent. we have performed
a few rough experiments, replacing the jumps of  by jumps of 3,, , 3, each with
probability 1/4 and by jumps of 5,3,, , 3, 5, each with probability 1/6. if the
measures continue to exist, but with gb modied as suggested by (52) then the fourier
coecients would continue to be distributed as gaussians but with g = gb of (42) multiplied
by 1
b/  .68 of the distribution

35 respectively, so that the ideal value of p2r2

5 and by 3

at 0 would be multiplied byp1/5 orp3/35 yielding  .31 and  .20. in the rst row of

figure 40 (four and six jumps) the distribution of the fourier coecients ra1 for a cylinder
of size 299  599 is compared in each of these cases with a gaussian with the same value
at 0. there is some similarity but considerable dierence. moreover the value at 0 is close
to but dierent from the suggested value. for the higher coecients the distribution looks
more and more like a gaussian. in the second row of figure 40 the distributions of ra5,
normalized so that the factor k with which we are familiar from section 2 are compared
with gaussians. not only are they closer to gaussians, but the values at 0 are closer to those

on the other hand, the rst row of figure 41, in which the distributions of ra1 for the
three sizes 99 199, 199 399, and 299 599 are compared in each of the two cases, suggests
that the limiting measures may none the less exist. so does the second row of figure 41

for ra5. we have, however, as yet made no serious eort to decide whether this is so, nor
whether these measures could be conformally invariant and universal.

another possible natural choice for the relative weights of the jumps n, n odd is given
by the dirichlet form. its discretized form (45) used in section 6 suggests that the weights
2k+1 and 1 of having a jumps (2k + 1) or  satisfy 2k+1 = 2k+1
. if 1 is xed by
requiring thatpiz 2i+1 = 1, then 1 = 21. then the constant gb would be multiplied
by the inverse ofpiz 2i+1(2i + 1)2 = 3, that is 1

in addition to (50) we also examined, following a suggestion of thomas spencer, the

behavior of

h(n(p)  hn(p)i)2i/ ln|p|,

whose behavior is pertinent when attempting to establish (44) rigorously, in disks of radii
200 and 300. although the results are not relevant to this paper, they are presented, for the
curious reader, in figure 42. once again, the curves are extremely at, but there is a drop
for the larger radius that has to be explained.

7.2 the fortuin-kasteleyn construction.

the fortuin-kasteleyn formulation of the ising model can be used to map the partition
function of the high-temperature phase of the model to a percolation-like sum over bond
congurations. to construct the f-k version of an ising model on a planar graph g with
vertices s  s and bonds b  b we shall form the rst barycentric subdivision g of g. thus
associated to g are the vertices s, the bonds b, each joining two sites, and the faces f , each
face f being bounded by sites and vertices. the sites s of g are the sites in s and points
obtained by choosing arbitrarily from each bond b and each face f a point in its interior.
thus, set-theoretically, s = s  b  f . the bonds b are pairs consisting of a bond in b
and one of its ends or a face in f and a bond or vertex on its boundary. in fact, the bonds
in b joining a face to a vertex in its boundary are for our purposes superuous and are not
included in our constructions.

74

the partition function of the original model is taken in the form

z =x yb

exp(j(s),(t)).

(53)

here s and t are the two sites joined by b. thus sinh(j) = 1, j = .881374. for a given
conguration , the clusters, in the sense of this paper, are maximal connected subsets of s
on which  is of constant sign. to obtain a fortuin-kasteleyn cluster we remove the bonds
of these connected clusters one by one with probability 1/ = .414214,  = exp j. this
replaces the sum (53) by a sum over decompositions of g into subgraphs, each component
being provided with a sign. a decomposition is the subgraph obtained by keeping all vertices
and removing some bonds.

the sum in the second line runs over all decompositions into subgraphs, each component
being signed, so that a constant spin is assigned to each of its vertices, and so do the sums
in the remaining lines. from a signed decomposition we can of course reconstruct, from the
signs alone, the original state of the ising model. this state has r bonds that join sites with
the same spin, so that its probability is r. the number of bonds in the subgraph is q and
the factor (1  1
 )rq is the probability that we arrive at it on removing bonds. if we
now ignore the spins, the nal sum in (54) becomes

to construct the function h we associate to a decomposition a state  on s. the value of
 is 1 at the vertices of g, at the bonds of g that belong to the subgraph, but is 1 at all other
vertices of g. now h can be constructed as before, except that the jumps are to be /2
and not . it turns out to be instructive, at least for the crossing probabilities, to replace
the probability 1/ by a variable probability 1   between 0 and 1. thus f k = .585786.
we have considered only graphs formed by square lattices on either a cylinder (for dis-
tributions and correlations) or a rectangle (for crossing probabilities). our aim was not
to establish conformal invariance and universality for the f-k construction, but rather to
acquire a provisional understanding of the way the various objects introduced in this paper
behave under an alternative description of the model.

there are two ways to dene crossings in the f-k construction. if cluster signs are taken
into account, a crossing is a cluster of sites with positive spins that joins one side of the

rectangle to the opposite one. the crossing probabilities considered earlier are recovered if
 = 1 but the crossing probabilities are zero if  = 0.

if clusters are unsigned, crossings are dened as in bond percolation. this is more in
the spirit of the f-k formalism and we shall use this denition. note that both conventions
are linked: if + and  are the crossing probabilities over a positively or negatively signed
cluster, and + the probability that there are spanning clusters of both positive and negative
sign, then the probability  that an unsigned cluster crosses is given by the following obvious
relation,

 = + +   +.

our crossing probabilities now depend on two variables: the aspect ratio of the rectangle
r and the probability  of not removing a link. we studied each of these variables separately,
varying one and keeping the other xed. we rst took 1   = 1  f k  1/ and studied
the dependence on the aspect ratio. results for h(r, f k), the probability of a horizontal
crossings in g on either + or  clusters, are shown in figure 43. the numbers of sites in g
inside the rectangles were around 40000 and the samples 250000. the absence of symmetry
implies that duality fails,

the asymptotic behaviour of log h(r, f k), shown on figure 44, is found to be

h(r, f k) + h(1/r, f k) 6= 1.

log h(r, f k) r 0.502r + constant,
a number reasonably close to /2, despite the rather low statistics.

in the second experiment we measured the dependence on  of h(1, ). the results
presented in figure 45 raise the question whether  = f k might be a critical value of the
function h(r, f k) or at least of h(1, f k), that is h(1, ) would be zero for 0 <  < f k

this is conrmed by the graphs of figure 46. in the rst the radius of the disk considered
is relatively small, about 60 bond units; for the second it is 180 bond units. the presence of
three distinct curves, corresponding to the cases that p is a new site on an old site, an old
bond, or an old face, while 0 is taken to be a new site on an old, is curious. it appears that
they remain distinct in the limit of an innite radius, but their separation remains bounded.
once again the scale in the vertical direction is very large; the curves of these diagrams are,
in fact, extremely at except near the ends.

on the cylinder, the correlation functions behave as

h(h(p)  h(q))2i  a() + b()|p  q|,

at least if p and q lie on a common generator. as observed in section 6, the quantity a()
is a constant that depends on the mesh and on the nature of the pair {p, q}, on whether p
or q is a site, bond or face of the graph g. if the conventions of the equation (41) are used,
the value of b(f k), estimated on a cylinder of size 99  699, is close to .26.
we studied the distribution of the function h for two sizes of cylinder, 149  339 and
299 679, but only on the boundaries, not on inner circles. these cylinders are a little short,
so that about 8/1000 of the samples are such that the sum of the jumps on a circumference
are not 0, but passing to longer cylinders of size 149 449 and 299 899, although it reduces
this fraction to 2/1000 does not change the conclusions. the measures on the boundary

appear to be gaussian once again, but with a new value of gb that is a little greater than
3. (given the behavior of k of figure 47 it is not so clear what gb is to be. further study
might suggest dening it by the asymptotic behavior of k.) we plot the values of k for
1  k  30 on figure 47. the results, coarse as they are, are similar to those described in
section 2, although there are curious features that advise against hasty conclusions. the
collection of values for the two cylinders cross at k = 7. graphs of the distributions of ra1
and ra5 appear in figure 48. on the left the results for the cylinders of dierent sizes
are compared with each other; on the right the results for the largest of the two cylinders
are compared with gaussians. figures 47 and 48 together suggest that the behavior of the
function h constructed according to the fk-denition might have similarities with that of
the function constructed by the methods of this paper, but we have not examined the matter
carefully. in particular, we tested neither conformal invariance nor universality.

7.3

innite temperature.

for the ising model at innite temperature, thus for site percolation in which each site is open
with probability .5, the crossing probabilities cease to be of interest. they are all 0 or, in
exceptional and trivial cases, 1. on the other hand, the partition functions z(1, 2, x, q)
seem to behave much like those at the critical temperature. in figure 49 we present results
for the square lattice on cylinders of size 99  399 and size 299  1199. on the top, the
results for ra1 and ra10 for these cylinders are compared with each other. on the bottom
the results for the largest of the two cylinders are compared with a gaussian. as in figure
1, there has been no renormalization of these distributions, so that if the distributions were

similar to those of section 2 the ratio of the heights of the two curves would be 1/10  .32.

it is about .34, but the cylinders are still fairly small. although this has no perceptible

consequences, these cylinders are short enough that about 15/10000 of the sample states
yield jumps whose sum along a circumference is not 0, so that the states at the two ends are
certainly not independent. in figure 50 the results for the smallest cylinder are compared
with those for a cylinder on a triangular lattice of size 116  401. this is a very stubby
cylinder, but, curiously enough, once again only about 15/100000 of the states are such that
the sum of the jumps along a circumference is not 0. figure 51 is analogous to figure 2: the
two sequences of points on the left are for the square lattice, the upper for the smaller of
the two cylinders, the lower for the larger; the two sequences of points on the right are for
the smaller of the cylinders with a square lattice (lower set) and for the cylinder with the
triangular lattice (upper set). if figure 51 is to be believed the constant 2rb changes and
becomes approximately one-half its previous value, but, as with the other examples of this
section, our aim was more qualitative than quantitative.

we can also introduce, as in section 5, the partition functions z++ and z+

or the
measures z(, x). a little reection shows that the two numbers do not depend on q and
are now both equal to 1

2. the analogue

z++0 + z+ = mq ({bk = 0}, x)

of an equation deduced from equations (30) and (31) is not valid, rather the simulations
suggest that, if z(0, x, q) exists, then it peaks at /2 and 3/2. on the other hand,
z(0, 0, x, q) has quite a dierent behavior and a relation between zq=0({ak},{bk}, x) and
zq=0({ak}, x) like that of equation (35) is dicult to ascertain because the functions h do
not very often have level lines that encircle the cylinder, even when the cylinder is very long.

more pertinent to the study of the measures at criticality is that the behavior of

z z(1, 2, x)d2/z z(1, 2, x)d2dx =x k () exp(ikx)

8 afterword.

most of the phenomena we have examined in the paper are manifestations of the inuence
of the boundary, so that to some extent the thrust of the paper runs counter to the notion
that statistical mechanics, especially as it refers to critical phenomena, is the study of bulk
properties. since critical behavior appears when the appropriate equilibrium between the
strength of the interactions and the number of paths by which the interaction is transmitted
over long distances is achieved it is not, from a mathematical standpoint, such a bad idea to
study criticality by examining the consequences of systematically blocking large numbers of
these paths. on the other hand, renormalization is usually conceived in bulk terms. so it is
a relief that the distributions investigated here, whose ultimate purpose is the introduction
of a concrete notion of xed point, do not become trivial when the boundary moves o to
innity.

for the ising model, however, in contrast to percolation or to the free boson, there are
formal diculties in the introduction of a closed renormalization transformation that we are
still unable to overcome, even with measures that continue to have a meaning in the bulk.
one connection that we would like to make, and that is suggested by some of the ex-
perimental results of the paper, is with the notion of conformally invariant eld theory in
the strongly geometric form envisaged by graeme segal ([s1, s2]). it may be that the basic
objects of that theory are constructible from the measures examined in this paper. recall
that in that theory one of the rst objects to construct is a hilbert space

h =x

h  h 

associated to a circle with parametrization. in addition, suppose that we are given a rie-
mann surface  with boundary c consisting of disjoint parametrized circles c1, . . . , cm and
c1, . . . , cn, the parametrizations being given by real analytic functions. then (equation
(1.4) of [s1]) the theory is provided with an operator

u : hm  hn.

we might suppose that h is the l2-space of a measure  on the space of distributions on
the parametrized circle. one such measure whose existence is suggested by the experiments
of this paper is the measure  on distributions on a circle in the plane or on the central circle
of an innite cylinder described at the end of paragraph 3.2, thus the measure dened in
the bulk. it is possible that l2() is, if not h, then the vacuum sector h0  h 0 or some
other subspace of h.
consider the annulus q of inner radius q and outer radius 1 and the operator uq associ-
ated to this surface. take c2 to be the outer circumference with the natural parametrization
and c1 the inner and c to be their union. we consider the annulus as imbedded in the plane,
or if we treat it as a cylinder of nite length as being imbedded in a cylinder extending to
innity in both directions. the construction of bulk measures suggested in section 3 yields
experimentally a measure mq = mq,c on the product of the spaces of distributions on c1
and c2. if, as we might suppose, mq is absolutely continuous with respect to    then it

84

is given by a kernel

dmq(2, 1) = kq(2, 1)d(2)d(1).

it is not impossible that the operator uq, or rather its restriction to the sector represented
by l2(), is given by

uqf (2) =z kq(2, 1)f (1)d(1).
z kq2(2, )kq2(, 1)d().

an essential feature of these operators would be the relation uq = uq1uq2 when q = q1q2

which would follow from a relation

(55)

let c be the circle that separates the annulus of parameter q into annuli of parameters q1
and q2. we apply the notions of conditional probability and the markovian property, as well
as the obvious symmetry of kq, to the bulk measures. thus

kq(2, 1)d(2)d(1) = dmq(2, 1)

=z dmq(2, 1|)d()
=z dmq1(1|2|)dq2(2|)d()
=z dmq1(1|)dq2(2|)d()
= {z kq1(, 1)kq2(2, )d()}d(1)d(2),

from which the equation (55) would follow.

these are tentative suggestions, and we only make them to confess that we have not yet
had an opportunity to test them experimentally. that may not be an easy matter. nor
do we know whether they are conrmed by the conventional wisdom. to construct some
analogue of segals operators on the whole h it will probably be necessary to utilise the
phase of section 5, but here again more reection is necessary.
another set of experiments waiting to be performed, although here the outcome is more
certain and the experiments therefore less tempting, is an examination of the behavior of
the measures in a neighborhood of the critical point as we vary j (or the temperature)
and introduce a small magnetic eld. the limits as the mesh goes to 0 are expected to
exist no longer, but the behavior of the measures, of their moments for example, should
yield the usual critical exponents  and  and should correspond to the usual intuition.
we are nevertheless curious to see how the geometry of the xed point is reected in the
coordinates introduced in this paper and to see, in particular, which linear combinations
become irrelevant.

we have also not pursued the study of other models, the potts model, the n-vector model
and so on. the examples of section 7 indicate a surprising sensitivity to the denitions that
it would be useful to examine further. for the ising model we made, more by good luck than
good management, a particularly happy choice which it is not utterly clear how to generalize
to other models.

85

appendix.

the present work contains simulations of both qualitative and quantitative nature. we
aimed in most of sections 2 to 6 to provide numerical results reproducible to the precision
of statistical errors.
it is therefore important that we be precise about our conventions.
though many details are given in the text we complete here with some technical details. in
paragraphs 3.4 and 5.3 and in section 7 the work is mostly qualitative and the reader who
wants to examine these matters further will need to devise his own experiments.

distribution md.

according to the principles of the introduction, each possible function h lying above a given 
is to be assigned the same measure. this principle has to be incorporated into the programs
locally. for example, there are two possibilities for the conguration of jump lines (or level
curves) passing through the center of the conguration appearing in the rst row of figure
53. they are chosen with equal probability. since the curves are constructed one at a time
by adjoining edges, when we rst adjoin an edge passing through the center we then turn
to the left or right with equal probability 1/2. the next time we pass through the center
there is no choice; there is only one unused successor remaining. for a triangular lattice,
there are no ambiguous congurations. for the hexagonal lattice, all combinations of + and
 around vertices of the dual lattice lead to at most two possible choices of jump lines (and
they are then treated as in the square lattice) except for the congurations in the two last
rows of figure 53 for which there are ve possible local congurations of jump lines. each
will then have the probability 1
5. as a consequence, when a curve rst passes through the
center of this conguration it continues on a straight line with probability 1
5 (which then
leads necessarily to one of the congurations in the bottom row) or makes a sharp reverse
turn to the left or the right with equal probabilities 2
5. if the rst curve through the center is
straight, the following curves are determined. otherwise the next curve, which may very well
be a continuation of the rst, returning after perhaps extensive wandering, has two options,
each chosen with probability 1
2 .

for the square lattice, two examples of the random determination of h occur in figure 54
where a conguration was drawn together with the jump lines of h. if the site at the bottom-
left corner has coordinate (1, 1), then four clusters meet at (9 1
2). in the
rst occurence, the two minus-clusters are joined and, in the second, they are separated. by
denition the jump lines occur on edges dual to lattice bonds. their vertices were rounded
in this gure to show clearly the dierence between joining and separating. the jump lines
that wrap around the cylinder are indicated by dashed lines.

the restrictions of h (on both the cylinders and the squares) was taken along several
curves c. for the square lattices the curves were taken along lines of sites so that the
intersection with dual bonds is unambiguous. the triangular lattices were oriented such
that longitudinal lines with sites had one site per mesh unit. the longitudinal lines with
sites of the hexagonal lattices had the pattern site-site-vacant repeated over every three-mesh
cycles. for the triangular and hexagonal lattices the conformal images of the curves ci on
the cylinder never contained dual bonds parallel to them. they were however moved slightly

to the closest position where their intersections with dual bonds were equally spaced. for
the curves c = c0 at the boundary they were chosen as the curve closest from the boundary
satisfying the previous requirement.

we also measured the distributions on a disk of radius r = 300.2. the center of the disk
was a site. all the sites inside the disk of radius r, and only these, were thermalized. some
of the boundary sites had three neighbors, others only two. we then determined an eective
radius re as the radius of the largest circle that intersects only dual bonds associated to
sites in the disk. it turned out to be re = 299.50. the restriction of h at the boundary was
obtained along the circle of radius re   with  = 0.001. the jumps in h are of the form
(  0) where 0 is the position of the intersection on the circle of the dual bond with
the curve c. the exact positions of all the intersections with dual bonds were determined
and used to compute fourier coecients. the radius of inner circles were determined as
fractions of (re  ). for example c0 and c1 are at 8 mesh units from one another on the
397  793 cylinder and the radii of the corresponding curves on the disk should be (re  )
and 0.8811(re  ) since e28/397  0.8811.
initial thermalization was provided by a few thousand swendsen-wang sweeps starting
from a random conguration for the smaller cylinders, by 5000 sweeps for 397  793 and by
10000 or more for 793  1585. after the initial thermalizations, measurements were taken
every third swendsen-wang sweep for all the cylinders, except for the 793  1585 for which
we used a 5-sweep cycle. a quick time-series analysis indicated that these cycle lengths
insured proper statistical independence of consecutive measurements. the pseudo-random
number generator was the one proposed by tezuka and lecuyer in [tl].

programs for the square lattice on the cylinders and on the disks were written indepen-
dently by at least two of the authors and errors were chased down until measurements agreed
within the statistical errors reported in the text.

it might not be clear, on reading the main text, why certain data are given for some of the
geometries studied and not for others. it is because the results for the various runs were kept
in two dierent formats. for the rst format, the observed values of each random variable
ak or ak were grouped into 401 bins of equal size. thus for each random variable, 401
nonnegative integers were stored. the width of the bins used during the rst months was
a little too narrow and some of the values fell outside the range covered. later, in the nal
months, the bin width was adjusted to avoid this diculty. when we used the rst format,
we also kept, most of the time, the sum, the sum of the squares and the sum of mixed
products of the random variables. these allowed us to calculate accurately the two rst
moments of the distribution and the correlation coecients. the second format was more
thorough. for each conguration of spins , we constructed one possible h and recorded
its restriction to the various curves c, not simply to the extremities of the cylinder or its
median. when we realized that the conformal invariance might hold in the sense of section
3, we kept the restriction of h on more curves. these data bases, with only the boundary as
c or with several curves c for each conguration, are sizeable even when compressed (a few
gigabytes in all). we generated one for the cylinder 397  793 with eleven curves c. for
59 401 and 157 1067 we only kept the restriction of h to one extremity. with the second
format it was possible to test various assertions that we could not have anticipated without
the experience gained from the experiments, but the rst required far less memory, so that

more sizes were examined.

crossings.

to determine the aspect ratio of the rectangles where the crossings are measured we have
used the width and the height of the smallest rectangle that contains the sites of the lattice
considered. for example, for the rectangles of lv  lh sites of the square lattice, the ratio
is lh/lv . we used here the orientations of the lattices used for the measurement of md
(see above).

for h, v and hv on rectangles, crossings started on + spins from one boundary and
ended on + spins on the other. for a
v , the crossings were required to reach the
central meridian if it contained sites or, if it did not, to reach the line of sites just before.
the dimensions of the rectangles for the square lattice were the same as those used for
percolation crossings in [lpps]. the results for the triangular lattices are given in table
vii. the dimensions {lv, lh} that were used are

the ratio r is given by r = 2lh/3lv as lh and lv count the number of lines and
columns of sites.

for h, v and hv on the disk, crossings started from and ended on sites in the annulus
v had to reach the central

between r = 300.2 and r  2. the crossings for a

h and a

diameter.

on cylinders the crossings between the curves ci started from and ended on the curves.
on the disk the ve curves were chosen at radii r, 0.8811r, 0.7763r, 0.6026r, 0.3632r with

r = 300.2  2. the crossings from ci to cj (ri > rj) started outside the outer curve ci

and ended inside the inner cj.

the programs for all lattices and geometries were written by two of us and checked until
they agreed within the statistical errors for a sample larger than 106 even though most
crossings were measured with samples of  200k. (see section 4 for the samples used for
the various lattices and geometries.)

the distribution of the random variable x is also used to obtain the ratios b/a through
the constrained integrals (32) and (33). the errors on the ratios b/a appearing in table
viii are dicult to evaluate as the numbers a and b are the local maxima of a smoothed
distribution. for the integral (32), the most dicult to measure, the samples varied between
31k and 50k. after experimentation with various smoothing parameters we think that the
two rst digits of the ratios b/a for the case constrained/constrained are exact. the accuracy
for the other cases is far better, the samples being at least 85k for the constrained/xed and
300k for the xed/xed.

these correlations can be measured in a straightforward way using the above denition of h
and the details in the text.
