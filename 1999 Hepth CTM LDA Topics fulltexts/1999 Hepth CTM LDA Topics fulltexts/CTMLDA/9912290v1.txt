abstract

we discuss shue identities between feynman graphs using the hopf
algebra structure of perturbative quantum eld theory. for concrete ex-
position, we discuss vertex function in massless yukawa theory.

introduction

the perturbative expansion of a quantum eld theory is given in terms of feyn-
man graphs which demand integration over positions of all internal vertices.
such spacetime integrations diverge due to singularities located in the regions
where the positions of two or more such vertices coincide. the required pro-
cess of renormalization amounts to a continuation of the generalized functions
provided by feynman integrands. those integrands are well dened on the
conguration space of vertices at distinct locations and have to be continued
to diagonals so that the resulting analytic expressions are integrable along the
diagonals. thus, morally speaking, renormalization is a problem dual to com-
pactication of conguration space, but generalizes such compactications by
allowing for the freedom of scale variations in this continuation, resulting in the
presence of the renormalization group. from this viewpoint, it is no surprise
that the common algebraic structure underlying any perturbative quantum eld
theory is a hopf algebra based on rooted trees, as the latter are known to stratify
the various limits to diagonals in conguration space.

while the hopf algebra of rooted trees is the universal object for the hopf
algebra structure of perturbative quantum eld theory [5], for any specic theory
under consideration we can formulate the hopf algebra directly on feynman
graphs [3, 8]. in this latter formulation, the primitive generators of the hopf
algebra h are graphs free of subdivergences. the only non-trivial part of this

hopf algebra is spanned by the graphs with a non-vanishing overall degree of
divergence, which form a sub-hopf algebra hc whose primitive generators are
graphs which are overall divergent, but have no subdivergences. such graphs
provide well-dened scheme-independent coecients of divergence.

this algebraic set-up completely settles the renormalization procedure as a
mathematical well-dened principle, and dispenses with all conceptual criticism
of local point-particle quantum eld theory which is based on the appearance
of ultra-violet divergences [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. no need remains to abandon local
quantum eld theories for that reason: the mathematics of the perturbation
series of a local quantum eld theory is, as far as the uv sector is concerned,
sound and, to my mind, rich and beautiful.

with the mathematics of renormalization laid out in [2, 4, 5, 8] in particular,
we can ask for more structure which can be revealed thanks to the hopf algebra
structure of renormalization.

for a long time, david broadhurst and the author observed interesting
number-theoretic content in the evaluation of feynman graphs without subdi-
vergences, hence precisely in the primitive generators of the very hopf algebra
of graphs.

intuitively, a close connection between the topology of such a primitive graph
and its coecient of overall divergence was found by relating the topology of the
graphs to braid-positive knots in a highly empirical fashion [11]. nevertheless, a
faithful knot-to-number dictionary was established up to seven loops and more.
up to the six-loop level all coecients of divergence were found to be multiple
zeta values, while at the seven-loop level a few coecients remained unidentied,
and may well be shown, eventually, to point towards unexpected generalizations
of these classes of numbers.1

the algebraic structure of those numbers can be reasonably expected to be

mirrored by algebraic relations between feynman diagrams.

in this paper, we want to make rst attempts to describe such relations
between diagrams. we will consider quasi-shue identities, as they were con-
sidered for example in [1], which are known by many to form part of the algebraic
structure of euler/zagier sums [10].

we will formulate these quasi-shue identities making use of the opera-
tors b+ (the closed hochschild one-cocycle which exists is any hopf algebra of
the type considered here) and b, which is its inverse on the linear basis of
decorated rooted trees, but fails to be its inverse on products of rooted trees:

b+b(q t) 6= 0, see below.

we can then naturally formulate the shue algebra on decorated rooted

trees, and will turn to massless yukawa theory for concrete exposition.

we show that the iteration of vertex corrections provides, modulo nite
terms, a quasi-shue algebra, where letters are provided by all two-line irre-

1our results in [11] do not reduce the number content of eld theories in even dimensions

to multiple zeta values and thus do not yet fully support the conjecture in [9].

ducible four-fermion skeleton graphs.

we will nish the paper by showing that the term which determines the
deviation from a proper shue identity obeys a pentagon identity in its nite
part.

2 quasi shue identities

let a = a1, a2, . . . , be a locally nite graded set of letters, and w = khai be the
k-vectorspace of words built from such letters, with e, the empty word, being
the only word of degree zero. for all letters x, y  a and words w1, w2  w let
the shue product s : w  w  w be dened by s[e, w1] = s[w1, e] = w1 and

s[xw1, yw2] = xs[w1, yw2] + ys[xw1, w2].

(1)

then, (w, s) is known to form a commutative algebra (hence, s is commutative
and associative), known as the shue algebra.

if we further set s[e, w1] = s[w1, e] = w1 and

s[xw1, yw2] = xs[w1, yw2] + ys[xw1, w2] + c[x, y]s[w1, w2],

(2)

then (w, s) forms again a commutative associative algebra provided c : aa 
a is commutative, associative and adds degrees. see [1] for proof and details.
also, a proof of this claim will be given below in terms of operators b+, b.
we call (w, s) a quasi-shue algebra.

consider an algebra homomorphism  : (w, s)  v where v is some algebra,
(s[w1, w2]) = (w1)(w2). a prominent example is provided by iterated inte-
grals [12], where letters ai  a are represented by dierential one-forms, and the
iterated integral f w(x) fullls the shue identity f s(w1,w2)(x) = f w1 (x)f w2 (x).
essentially, this identity allows to rewrite any rooted tree with sidebranchings
as a sum over rooted trees without sidebranchings [4].

consider now decorated rooted trees [5] where decorations are taken from
the alphabet a. let h(a) be the resulting hopf algebra [3, 5]. as usual, we have
operators b, bx
i=1 t1 . . . b(ti) . . . tk and
we write b+b for

+, x  a, such that b(qk

i=1 ti) = pk

k

b+b(

yi=1

ti) :=

k

xi=1

br(ti)

+ (t1 . . . b(ti) . . . tk),

(3)

where r(t)  a gives the decoration at the root. with these denitions the
identity operator id : h  h, id(x) = x can be written as id = bbx
+ for all
x  a.

we can formulate a (quasi)-shue product on decorated rooted trees as
follows. we identify a k-letter word ai1 ai2 . . . aik with a decorated rooted tree
without sidebranchings,

t = ba1

+ (e),

+  ba2

+  . . .  bak

3

and write the shue product as

s[t1, t2] = br(t1)

+ (s[b(t1), t2]) + br(t2)

+ (s[t1, b(t2)]).

(4)

this is well-dened as b(t) is again a single rooted tree, due to the fact that
t has no sidebranching. let h1(a) be the subset in h(a) of single deco-
rated rooted trees, ie. the linear basis of h(a). in general, on h1(a), b is a
map h1(a)  h(a) while on rooted trees without sidebranchings, b maps
h1(a)  h1(a).

we can dene the shue product for arbitrary decorated rooted trees t 
i=1 ti) =

h1(a) using u : h(a)  h1(a) given in an iterative manner by u(qk
s[t1, u(qk

i=2 ti)], u(ti) = ti:

s[t1, t2] = br(t1)

+ (s[u(b(t1)), t2]) + br(t2)

+ (s[t1, u(b(t2))]).

(5)

we obtain a quasi-shue algebra on decorated rooted trees if we replace s

by s everywhere, thus

s[t1, t2] = br(t1)

+ (s[u(b(t1)), t2]) + br(t2)

+ (s[t1, u(b(t2))])

+bc[r(t1),r(t2)]

+

(s[u(b(t1)), u(b(t2))]),

(6)

u(qk

i=1 ti) = s[t1, u(qk

i=2 ti)], u(ti) = ti. the algebras so obtained are com-
mutative algebras if c fulls the requirements listed above. commutativity
follows immediately by induction over the number of vertices. let us prove,
again by induction, associativity in some detail to get acquainted with the use
of bx
+, b. our proof is essentially an elaborated version of the one in [1]. let
t1, t2, t3  h(a). for s[t1, s[t2, t3]] we nd

we assume associativity at n vertices to nd (7) = (16) + (17) + (18), (8) +
(11) + (14) = (20), (10) = (17), (9) = (21), (12) = (23) and (13) = (18). hence,
assuming associativity of s for products of trees with up to n vertices, we obtain
associativity at n+ 1 vertices provided the map c fullls the requirements listed
above, which nally ensures (15) = (24). the start of the induction is easily
proved with such a map c.

in the next section, we will consider an alphabet essentially given by an
innite set of skeleton graphs in yukawa theory, graded by the loop number,
and investigate to what extent we can formulate a quasi-shue identity. hence
we have to investigate if we can nd an appropriate map c.

the following result shows that that the transition from a shue identity to a
quasi-shue identity essentially measures the non-vanishing of the commutator
[b+, b] = b+b  bb+. we have

u([b+, b](x)) = 0.

(25)

proof: proceed by induction on the number of vertices, using the denitions of
s and b+b.

yukawa theory. hence, let us consider two-line irreducible subdivergence-free
four-fermion skeleton graphs k [i] in massless yukawa theory. upon closure, we
obtain an overall divergent subdivergence-free vertex correction corresponding
to a graph [i], cf. fig.(2), at zero momentum transfer. at each loop number,
we have a nite number of such primitive graphs, and the graphs k [i] provide
an example of an alphabet a in the sense above.

to each graph k [i] belongs an analytic expression u (k [i])(k, q) and the

closure to a vertex correction is dened by the integral

u ([i])(q) = gz ddk

1
k2 u (k [i])(k, q),

(26)

where g is the renormalized coupling constant.2 these graphs k [i] provide an
alphabet, and the vertex correction corresponding to the word w = i1i2 . . . ik is

we can regard u as a character from the hopf algebra h(a) to the ring of
meromorphic functions a as in [7, 8] and the minimal subtracted counterterm
is given by the character u of the unique birkho decomposition u = u 1
 
u+, where u+ is the character which assigns the renormalized feynman graph
u+([w]) to the bare unrenormalized u ([w]) [7, 8].

2obviously, the kernels u (k [i]) are themselves of order [g2]1+grad(k[i]), where grad gives

the loop number.

indicated. we also give the vertex correction u ([2,3])(q).

consider a dierent character u dened by

u ([i])(q) = gz ddk

using the convolution of characters and the antipode s of h(a) , we have
u = u  u  s  u as a trivial identity. the character u  s  u maps to
functions holomorphic at d = 4. indeed, it delivers nite renormalized green
functions by construction: all divergent forests in u ([w]) are compensated by
appropriate forests in u  s([w]), as such ratios u  s  u reproduce the forest
formula [2, 5, 8].

we have thus isolated the uv-divergences of such vertex corrections in
u ([w]), and hence in the minimal subtracted counterterms u([w]). obvi-
ously, a nite rerenormalization by u  u  s connects u and u:

u = u  u  s  u.

(30)
the character u can be calculated with considerable ease, as it relies solely on
knowledge of u (k [i])(q), which, being a function of the single parameter q2, has
the form, with z := (d  4)/2,

u (k [i])(q) = [q2]1+zgrad(k [i])f [i](z).

(31)

hence,

u ([i])(q) = gq2 (1, 1 + (grad(k [i]) + 1)z)f [i](z),

where we use the g-function

gq2 (a, b) := z ddk

[k2]a[(k + q)2]b

(32)

(33)

which evaluates to

gq2 (a, b) = [q2]2zab (a + b  2 + z)(2  z  a)(2  z  b)

(a)(b)(d  a  b)

.

(34)

the evaluation of words w via u ([w])(q) then delivers products of g- and f [i]-
functions. the leading pole term of feynman diagrams fullls a shue identity
[13], and indeed, here we nd, for example,

u([s[i1,i2])  u ([i1]) u ([i2]) 

1
z

,

(35)

where s[i1, i2] = i1i2 + i2i1. we want to investigate if the term  1/z can
be understood as resulting from a quasi-shue identity. this is possible as
a quasi shue identity would precisely demand that this term is of the form
u ([c(i1,i2)]), where c(i1, i2) must be regarded as a single letter, hence be given
by an expression without subdivergences, hence  1/z. we want to know if,
for arbitrary letters represented as u (k [i1]), u (k [i2]), we can dene an analytic
expression u (k [c(i1,i2)]) such that

u([s[i1,i2])  u ([i1]) u ([i2])

(36)

is nite. here,

u ([s[i1,i2]) = u([i1i2]) + u ([i2i1]) + u ([c(i1,i2)).

(37)

let us now dene such a map which assigns to any two letters a new one. we
dene

exists and that eq.(36)) is fullled, solely due to the remarkable properties of
g-functions. also, one immediately conrms that c2(i1, i2) = c2(i2, i1).

to check associativity of c2 let us dene

j(n1, n2) := g1(2 + n1z, 2 + n2z)  g1(1 + n1z, 2 + n2z)  g1(2 + n1z, 1 + n2z).

is nite.

so far we worked up to nite parts. the results show that we identify a
shue algebra in the uv-divergences of iterated vertex corrections, and we

figure 4: s[s[a, b], c] given explicitly. from the three terms in the rectangle we
read o the contributions of c3. those three terms provide decorations, in which
c2 terms (abbreviated by c in the gure) are nested. c3 terms contributes
to s[s[a, b], c]in the cyclic sum c3(a, b, c) + c3(b, c, a) + c3(c, a, b). as c3 is
commutative in the last two arguments, c3(a, b, c) = c3(a, c, b), no violations
of associativity arise from c3, as s[a, s[b, c]] provides the same terms.

realized the beginning of a shue identity in eq.(36). the nite parts which we
disregarded so far will be essential in the full quasi-shue algebra. they will
appear inside further divergent loop integrations, and hence modify the latter
in a non-trivial manner.

let us nish this paper with an investigation to what extent these nite

parts obstruct a quasi-shue identity.

the violation of the quasi-shue identity in the nite part contributes, when

integrated against a further letter a, by

c3(a, i1, i2) = z ddk

k2 h u ([b+,b](i1,i2))(k)  u(c2(i1,i2))(k)i k [a](k  q, 0).

here,

[b+,b](i1,i2) = [i1i2] + [i2i1]  [i1][i2].

this has no contribution to the violation of associativity, as it is demonstrated
in fig.(4). it can be incorporated in a redenition of c2 respecting the quasi-
shue algebra.

more interesting is the nite violation of associativity generated by c2. ex-

plicitly, one nds

j(n1, n2)j(n1 + n2, n3)  j(n2, n3)j(n1, n2 + n3) = 4z(n1  n3) + o(z2) (45)

so that the violation of associativity is proportional to the dierence between
the loop numbers, the degree, of the rst and last letter. hence, the nite terms

(n1n3)+(n1n4)+(n2n4) = 2n1+n2n32n4 = (n1+n2n4)+(n1n3n4)

is satised, cf. fig.(5).

4 conclusions

we have shown how quasi-shue algebra can be naturally formulated using
the operators b+, b. we then investigated representations of this algebra by
feynman diagrams, and found that, in the case of yukawa theory considered
here, such representations could be obtained modulo nite violations of associa-
tivity. these violations obey a pentagon identity in the nite part, and it will
be an interesting exercise to work out the coherence laws of higher orders in z
in the future. we regard the results in this paper as a rst attempt towards an
algebraic understanding of the number-theoretic content of feynman diagrams.
