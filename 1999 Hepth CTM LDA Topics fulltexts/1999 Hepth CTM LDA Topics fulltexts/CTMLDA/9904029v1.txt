abstract

we apply a boost-invariant similarity renormalization group procedure to a light-front
hamiltonian of a scalar eld  of bare mass  and interaction term  g3 in 6 dimensions using
3rd order perturbation theory in the coupling constant g. two counterterms are obtained: a
change in  and a change of g. the renormalization group ow of eective hamiltonians is inte-
grated analytically. the resulting running coupling constant exhibits asymptotic freedom. the
evolution of the coupling with the width of eective hamiltonians agrees with results obtained
using feynman diagrams and dimensional regularization when one identies the renormaliza-
tion scale with the eective hamiltonian width. the eective light-front schrodinger equation
is equally valid in a whole class of moving frames of reference including the innite momentum
frame. therefore, the calculation described here provides an interesting pattern to follow in
the case of hamiltonians applicable in particle physics.

1. introduction

similarity renormalization group procedure for hamiltonians is a method suggested for
seeking solutions to qcd and other quantum eld theories en bloc including bound states, by
calculating manageable eective hamiltonians and solving schrodinger equations with them in a
series of successive approximations of increasing accuracy. this article describes an elementary
application of the similarity method in case of scalar elds, showing details of one running
coupling constant calculation in eective hamiltonians in third order perturbation theory. we
briey review the method, describe the simple example and present conclusions.

the method originates in the notion of renormalization group as discussed by wilson [1]
[2] and uses the idea of similarity renormalization group procedure for hamiltonians [3] [4].
similarity enables us to avoid small energy denominators in perturbative evaluation of eec-
tive hamiltonians. the evaluation includes nding counterterms and dening renormalized
dynamics. small energy denominators could lead to large errors in the counterterms and in
calculation of eective hamiltonians. thus, if not avoided through similarity, the small de-
nominators would prevent precise theoretical predictions based on the eective schrodinger
equations.

the similarity procedure was invented to sort out complexities of the light-front form of
hamiltonian dynamics. this form was distinguished a long time ago by dirac [5] and more
recently became a natural candidate for description of hadronic constituents in hard scattering
processes [6] as well as in spectroscopy [7] using qcd. a recent review article by brodsky, pauli
and pinsky [8] provides a description of theoretical advances made in light-front formulation of
various theories mainly before invention or independently of the similarity procedure. reviews
by burkardt, harindranath and perry [9] help in understanding the scope of current approaches.
recent research in the direction of renormalization of hamiltonians can be traced through ref.
[10]. the present article is focused on similarity in light-front dynamics.

initial studies of quarkonium bound states, which are related to the similarity program
described in [7] have been performed by brisudova and perry, and brisudova, perry and wilson
[11] following the key observation by perry [12] that second order eective hamiltonian of qcd
contains a conning term, which may remain uncanceled in the eective schrodinger equation
dynamics. higher than second order calculations are essential for verifying this hypothesis.

since the formal front form of hamiltonian dynamics is invariant under boosts one hopes
it can provide a link between the structure of hadrons at rest and in the parton model. that
such unifying picture is hard to achieve in standard dynamical schemes is best illustrated by
the fact that despite extensive progress lattice gauge theory does not easily yield desired quark
and gluon bound state wave functions. [13] the light-front approach is still far from achieving
this goal, too. the present article shows the essence of boost invariance in similarity [14] but
the example we describe here is limited to scalar particles. the dynamics of scalars does not
involve genuine small-x singularities (x denotes a longitudinal momentum fraction carried by
a particle in the innite momentum frame) that require additional boost-invariant cuto on

2

small x [14] and the present work does not directly apply to real particles.

the present paper also does not cover the step of solving the eective schrodinger equation.
it was shown in an asymptotically free matrix model [15] that one can achieve 10 % accuracy
in calculating bound state properties using second order eective hamiltonians but it is not
known yet if the same accuracy can be reached in any quantum eld theory of interest using
the boost-invariant similarity approach discussed here.

before we proceed to our example, we rst disclose the mechanism of preserving boost
invariance in the similarity approach. the following discussion points out relevant features of
the procedure using other methods for comparison.

the similarity renormalization group procedure leads to eective hamiltonians h = h0 +
hi, whose matrix elements between any two eigenstates of h0 vanish when the eigenvalues of
h0 for these states dier by more than the width . the word width is natural because
the eective hamiltonian matrix can be viewed as a band of non-zero matrix elements along
the diagonal and the width of the band depends on . another reason for the word width
is that the band structure is ensured by similarity form factors in interaction vertices. the
form factors are functions of energy transfers, they are peaked around zero and their half-width
depends on . the notion of the hamiltonian width is key to our method of preserving boost
invariance.

we shall take advantage of wegners equation [16] to indicate where the boost invariance
can enter the similarity procedure. wegner invented a ow equation for diagonalization of
hamiltonians in solid state physics [16] [17] that is beautifully simple and can be adopted in
the similarity renormalization scheme [18] [15]. wegners equation can be written as

d
ds

h =  [ [h, h0 ], h]

,

(1.1)

where s = 2.
initial condition is provided at s = 0, corresponding to  = , and the
initial hamiltonian is denoted by h. wegners commutator [h, h0] generates the similarity
transformation. one discovers a gaussian similarity factor by solving eq. (1.1) for the hi
matrix elements between eigenstates of h0 keeping on the right-hand side only those terms
that are linear in hi and neglecting higher order terms.

one can apply eq. (1.1) to light-front hamiltonians of quantum eld theories. the hamil-
tonians are of the form h = (p  2 + m 2
i. since
the mass operators commute with the momentum operators p  and p + one can rewrite eq.
(1.1) in terms of the masses as follows

)/p + with the mass operator m 2

0 + m 2

 = m 2

p + 2 d
ds

m 2

 =  [[m 2

, m 2

0 ], m 2
]

.

(1.2)

thus, we see that a rescaling of the ow parameter s with a momentum eigenvalue gives a
ow equation for the mass operator matrix elements between eigenstates of p + and p . these
matrix elements may be independent of the eigenvalues. this is an attractive feature resembling

3

boost invariance but the ow of m 2 matrix elements violates cluster property [19] since the mass
is not an additive quantity; the mass depends on the relative motion of particles, which leads
to dependence of eective interactions on spectators, the denition of spectators themselves
being also specic to the matrix elements under consideration.

despite these drawbacks, allen and perry [20] succeeded in demonstration that one can
dene and calculate a running coupling constant using eq. (1.2) for m 2 matrix elements in
massless 3 theory in 6 dimensions. the authors demand that the ow of hamiltonians from
some  to a fraction of  reproduces the same hamiltonian structure in which only some param-
eters change. this condition is implemented using transverse locality and it allows for bypassing
the step of nding initial conditions (counterterms) needed for dierential equations, by intro-
ducing a running coupling constant. a question arises because studies of asymptotically free
models [15] [21] show that eective hamiltonians that are suitable for bound state calculations
may signicantly deviate from a self-replicating (xed point) ow with one coupling constant.
but in the case of many couplings helpful conditions may be provided by coupling coherence
[11] which may work in the approach of eq. (1.2) assuming that the cluster property breaking
does not complicate the coherence. since the lowest order ow of simplest matrix elements
does not involve spectators in a signicant way it is not known yet how severe is the violation
of cluster properties in eq. (1.2). kylin, allen and perry [22] extended the approach of allen
and perry to massive particles.

the similarity renormalization group procedure for hamiltonians diers considerably from
wegners equation by its exibility in dening the generator of the similarity transformation.
this exibility is used to preserve boost symmetry and cluster properties. the desired boost-
invariant operator formulation of similarity is given by the equation [14]

where the generator t is related to the similarity transformation operator, u, by

d
dh =  [t, h]

,

t = u 



d
d

u

.

(1.3a)

(1.3b)

the operator u is analogous to the melosh operator [23]. it transforms creation and annihila-
tion operators of bare particles (denoted generically by q since they correspond to  = ) into
creation and annihilation operators of eective particles corresponding to the width  (denoted
generically by q). namely,

q = u q u 


.

(1.3c)

[14] the curly notation in eqs. (1.3a) and (1.3b) as well as in
u is secured to be unitary.
the whole procedure, in contrast to roman letters in eqs.
(1.1) or (1.2), is introduced for
operators which are expressed in terms of operators q. the latter are independent of  and
are not dierentiated in eq. (1.3a). the general relation between the operators denoted by

4

curly and roman letters follows from eq. (1.3c) and reads, using the example of hamiltonians,
h = uhu 
.
the analogy with the melosh transformation stems from that the eective particles corre-
sponding to a small hamiltonian width  can be associated with constituent quarks or gluons
from hadronic rest frame spectroscopy while the bare particles with    can be associated
with current quarks and gluons from the innite momentum frame. the boost-invariant sim-
ilarity renormalization group procedure for light-front hamiltonians [14] makes the notions of
current and constituent quarks and gluons boost invariant. the procedure provides a calculable
dynamical content to the transformation that connects the current and constituent particles
independently of the reference frame one works in. this may sound confusing since melosh
transformation is associated with changing a frame of reference. on the other hand, light-front
dynamics is invariant with respect to boosts in perturbative calculations and this property
allows for translating a melosh-like transformation to one frame of reference, where it simply
relates bare particles and complex eective particles in the same theory.

boost invariance is guaranteed through the denition of the generator t. details will be
reviewed in the next section. the eective hamiltonian h is given by a diagonal proximum of
certain operator g, i.e. h = f[g], while the generator t is related to a diagonal remotum
of the same operator g; we introduce g = u 
d
d

gu and use [14]

[t,h0 ] =

(1  f)[g]

.

(1.4)

now, the diagonal proximum can be dened in a boost-invariant way. the point is that the
operation f multiplies every interaction term in an eective hamiltonian by a form factor which
is a function of boost invariant combinations of momenta labeling creation and annihilation
operators in that interaction term. thus, the generator of the similarity transformation does
not depend on the total momentum of any state, contrary to eq. (1.2). in [14], the scaling
role analogous to scaling provided by p + in eq. (1.2) is played for each term separately by
the parent momentum for that term. the parent momentum is simply half of the sum of all
momenta labeling all creation and annihilation operators in the term in question. all light-
front hamiltonians we consider are superpositions of terms which contain integrals over parent
momenta. usually, when a term acts on some state, a parent momentum equals only some
fraction of the total momentum of that state. this fraction is dened locally by the single
interaction act and lies in a range of values allowed by momentum conservation in the eective
schrodinger dynamics. therefore, no cluster property is violated in dening the similarity
generator through eq. (1.4).

in summary, the exibility available in dening the similarity transformation generator can
be used to obtain a boost-invariant band-diagonal structure of eective hamiltonians, through
a boost-invariant choice of the similarity form factors f. this aspect of the procedure is the
subject of the present article, quite independently of which theory or singularity is addressed.
naturally, the eective theory is easiest to make boost invariant if the initial hamiltonian is

5

regulated in a boost invariant way. for in that case the counterterms do not have to correct
the boost invariance breaking which a poorly chosen regularization would introduce. a suitable
regularization will be described in the next section.

this paper is organized as follows. section 2 reviews necessary elements of ref. [14] set up
for a third order calculation of the running coupling constant in hamiltonians of scalar 3 theory
in 6 dimensions. the calculation is based on a plain power series expansion in the coupling
constant and the only new element in comparison to [14] is the use of a gaussian function for
a similarity factor. counterterms are derived in section 3 and the eective coupling constant
ow is derived in section 4. section 5 concludes the paper. appendix presents formulae for the
third order eective vertex function with arbitrary momenta and masses.

2. effective hamiltonians

we focus our attention on a perturbative analysis of scalar quantum eld theory with an
interaction term  3 in 6 dimensions. the theory is known to be asymptotically free and this
property justies our perturbative analysis which is based on the assumption that the coupling
constant in the initial regularized hamiltonian is innitesimally small. our analysis is carried
out according to the general procedure from ref. [14].

2.1 initial hamiltonian

the classical lagrangian of the scalar eld theory in question is

the corresponding light-front hamiltonian reads [24] [25] (x = x0  x3)

(2.6)

it is unique in comparison to hamiltonians in other forms of dynamics because there are no
terms that contain only creation or only annihilation operators in eq. (2.6). at this point one
should recall that this essential feature is related to the problem of ground state formation,
0a
since h|0i = 0, where ak|0i = 0, and only a
0 terms in h could alter this feature,
but they are absent due to the cuto +. readers interested in non-perturbative aspects of
hamiltonian dynamics in the front form should consult [26]. however, no problems with modes
of k+ = 0 arise in perturbation theory for hamiltonians in the present paper.

0 and a

0a

the initial hamiltonian for the similarity renormalization group procedure is obtained from
eq. (2.6) by introducing an additional ultraviolet regularization factor (to be described below)
and taking the limit +  0. the initial hamiltonian is denoted by h, since it corresponds
to the initial width  =  in the similarity ow, as discussed in the introduction. creation
and annihilation operators that appear in h were denoted in the introduction by q.
due to the ultraviolet regularization, h contains a cuto parameter  in the regulariza-
tion factor, denoted by r.
in asymptotically free theories,  can be sent to innity when
the renormalization process passes the stage of calculating counterterms and deriving eective
hamiltonians of nite width . still, the initial hamiltonian contains the calculated countert-
erms which depend on  and are denoted by x. thus, we have

h = z [k]

the parameter + is set equal 0 and this is why it is not indicated, in distinction from eq. (2.6)
where it was kept larger than 0.

(2.7)

the regularization factor r has a simple form which results from the following steps (ap-
plicable to the interaction term written out explicitly in eq. (2.7) as well as to all counterterms
x derivable in perturbation theory). for a term containing a product of u creation and v
annihilation operators we dene a parent momentum, denoted by p +
uv, which equals half of
the sum of momenta labeling all the operators. for each momentum label ki, with i running
through u + v values, we introduce xi = k+
uv. the regularization factor
is dened as

i  xip 

uv and 

i = k

i /p +

consequently, the regularization factor in the second term in eq. (2.7) is

r =

the initial hamiltonian of the similarity renormalization group procedure in 3 theory in 6
dimensions is given by eq. (2.7). we have to calculate the counterterms x using an expansion
in powers of the coupling constant g, up to the third power, in order to derive the third order
running coupling constant in eective hamiltonians. the counterterms are calculated order by
order along the evaluation of the renormalization group ow of the eective hamiltonians.

2.2 similarity flow [14]

the eective hamiltonians are written as

where

h = f[g]

,

(2.10)

(2.11)
the operator g is divided in two parts, g = g0 + gi, where g0 = g(g = 0). gi satises
the following dierential equation as a consequence of eqs. (1.3a) to (1.4) (see ref. [14])

g = ugu 

.



d

dgi = "fgi, ( d

d

(1  f )gi)g0

#

.

(2.12)

we dropped the subscript  on the right-hand side for clarity. f denotes the similarity form
factor introduced by f and the curly bracket with the subscript g0 denotes a solution for t
resulting from eq. (1.4). we will omit the subscript g0 from now on and the reader should
remember that a curly bracket implies an energy denominator for every term in the bracket,
i.e. a factor equal an inverse of the eigenvalue of g0 corresponding to momentum labels of all
annihilation operators in a term minus eigenvalue of g0 corresponding to all creation operators
in the term.
the similarity factor is dened for any operator of the form described above eq. (2.8) as

f(u, v) = exp [(m2

u  m2

v)2/4]

.

(2.13)

the generic notation for invariant masses means, for example, that m2
where the minus components of the momentum four-vectors are given by k
for i = 1, ..., u.

u = (k1 + ... + ku)2,
i + 2)/k+

i = (k 2

i

let us denote dierentiation with respect to  by a prime and expand the eective interaction

in powers of the coupling constant g as



where n denotes the sum of all terms order gn in g. equation (2.12) implies

gi =

n

,

xn=1

 
n =

n1

[k, {(1  f )nk}]

,

xk=1

and the rst three terms in the expansion satisfy the following equations

 
1 = 0

,

2 = [{f 1}, f 1]
 

,

 
3 = [f 1,{f 2 + (1  f ) 

2}] + [f 2,{f 1}]

.

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16a)

(2.16b)

(2.16c)

equation (2.16a) implies that 1 is independent of  and equals the second term in the

initial hamiltonian from eq. (2.7). in other words, 1 = 1.

the corresponding eective hamiltonian interaction term is obtained by multiplying the
integrand in eq. (2.7) by f(12, 3) = exp {[(k1 + k2)2  2]2/4} and transforming operators
ak into ak using u after the evaluation process for g is carried out to the desired order.
this last step is unusual in the sense that the operator u depends on the regularization
(in scalar theory, the dependence is reduced to u being a function of ) but, at the same
time it is unitary and thus, it transforms nite products of creation and annihilation operators
by eectively replacing everywhere a by a and no other trace of u is left in the eective
if g is found to order gn, leaving terms o(gn+1) still undetermined, then t
hamiltonian.
is determined up to terms order gn from eq. (1.4). t is antihermitian order by order and
determines a unitary u to order gn. hence,

u yiu

a

i yjv

aj u 

 = yiu

a

i yjv

aj + o(gn+1)

.

(2.17)

so, the  dependence of u does not show up in h to order gn once g is renormalized to
order gn. in successive orders, the counterterms in g secure unitarity of u. a perturbative
proof of renormalizability for eective hamiltonians would require demonstration that there
exists a set of counterterms that remove  dependence from nite momentum parts of g at

9

nite  to all orders of perturbation theory when   0 (c.f. [3]). the present article does
not demonstrate such set exists in the case of 3 theory.
the transformation connecting two eective hamiltonians with dierent nite widths 1
and 2 is given by u1u 
2. one can easily see that the latter is free from dependence on 
once g is made independent of . it is sucient to observe that for an innitesimal dierence
between 1 and 2 the eective transformation u1u 
2 is given by the similarity generator that
is expressed in terms of the -independent g. integrating the innitesimal changes one obtains
the same conclusion for nite changes of the width.
evaluation of 2 and 3 involves calculation of two counterterms. both 2 and 3 are more

complicated in structure than 1 and their evaluation requires new notation. namely,

1 = 21 + 12

,

2 = 11 + 31 + 13 + 22

,

3 = 21 + 12 + 41 + 14 + 32 + 23

.

(2.18a)

(2.18b)

(2.18c)

each term contains products of creation and annihilation operators with xed numbers of the
operators in a product. the rst subscript indicates the number of creation operators, a
,
and the second subscript denotes the number of annihilation operators, a. for all the terms,
uv = 

vu.

equations (2.16a-c) imply for second order terms the following relations [14],


31 = 2f2[2121]31


13 = 2f2[1212]13


11 = 2f2[1221]11

,

,

,


22 = 2f2[2112 + 41221]22

.

j by commutators [ai, a

the brackets mean replacement of products aia
j] which result in the
remaining products of operators containing as many creation and annihilation operators as in-
dicated by the bracket subscripts, in the normal order, according to the same convention as in
eqs. (2.18a-c). the factor f2 depends on the momenta labeling creation and annihilation op-
erators. in eqs. (2.19a-d), the brackets with operators involve integrals over three-dimensional
momentum labels of all creation and annihilation operators and over loop momenta in loops
that result from contractions (in second order here only eq. (2.19c) for 
11 contains a loop
integral). the factor f2 is understood to appear under the integrals. symbolically, its structure

10

appears in eq. (2.16b) and reads f2 = {f }f  f{f }. the negative sign results from the
commutator in eq. (2.16b) which guarantees that only connected terms appear in the eective
interactions. this is a general property of the similarity procedure.

the factor f2 is the only factor depending on  on the right-hand side of eqs. (2.19a-d).

therefore, solutions are

31 = 2f2 [2121]31

13 = 2f2 [1212]13

,

,

11 = 2f2 [1221]11 + 11

,

22 = 2f2 [2112 + 41221]22

the only new element of solutions (2.20a-d) which requires explanation is the factor f2 =

creation operators in the brackets, c denotes the momenta labeling annihilation operators in
the brackets and b denotes the intermediate conguration, which includes the momenta labeling
operators contracted in the brackets and momenta labeling creation operators originating from
the interaction connecting conguration b with c and momenta labeling annihilation operators
originating in the interaction connecting conguration a with b.

p +

uv denotes the parent momentum of the whole connected interaction sequence between
momentum congurations u and v (in the second order case above this sequence reduces to a
single interaction vertex order g, but the denition of p +
uv remains valid in higher order cases

where the factor f3 has the generic structure f3 = [f{(1f )f2} + {f }ff2]  [{(1f )f2}f +

3. counterterms through order g3

the two counterterms, 11 from eq. (2.20c) and 21 from eq. (2.25), are calculated using
the equations they appear in. the counterterms simply remove  dependence from other terms
in those equations, for nite relative momenta dened through momentum labels of creation
and annihilation operators in those terms. we describe rst 11 and then 21.

the logarithmically divergent part agrees with results obtained using feynman diagrams and
dimensional regularization [27] [28] in the sense that when one changes  to  the logarithmic
part of the counterterm changes with  as the mass squared changes as a function of the
renormalization scale in eq. (7.1.22) from [28].

the mass squared term in the eective hamiltonian is simple and can be written as (  )

the value of 2
0 can be found only from comparison of theoretical predictions with data,
which are only gedanken in the present case. for example, by solving a single physical meson
eigenvalue problem one could express the physical meson mass in terms of 2
0 and adjust the
latter to obtain the observed mass value for mesons.

3.2 coupling constant counterterm

the coupling constant counterterm 21 is evaluated from eq. (2.25). the mass squared
counterterms remove quadratic divergences from the second and third terms in the bracket
multiplying f3 in eq. (2.25) and leave behind some logarithmically divergent contributions.
the resulting expression for 21 is

21 = z [k1k2k3] 2(2)55(k1 + k2  k3) [(k1, k2, k3) + (k1, k2, k3)] a

(3.6)
the counterterm function (k1, k2, k3) originates from 21 in eq.
(2.25). the part of
(k1, k2, k3) which involves log  is of the form (for massive as well as massless bare particles)

the second term originates from the next (4 + 2) terms in the rst bracket in eq.
(2.25)
combined with the mass counterterm terms in eq. (2.25).

evaluation of the integrals in eq. (3.7) produces the following result for the -dependent

(3.8)

where m is an arbitrary constant of the same dimension as ; the convergent part of (k1, k2, k3)
in the limit    contains a log m with the same coecient and opposite sign. note that
the result is independent of x1 and x2.
equation (3.8) is an important result since it implies that the counterterm, (k1, k2, k3) =
, is a constant, independent of the momenta labeling creation and annihilation operators in
the interaction term. this result allows us to remove divergences from eective hamiltonians
through a redenition of the initial coupling constant g, instead of introducing a whole function
of the momentum fractions x1 and x2 in the counterterm, which could force us to depart far away
from results derived using lagrangian approaches. [7] the constant in the counterterm equals
the negative of the logarithmically diverging term plus a nite number. the nite number
must be chosen to achieve agreement of theoretical results obtained from eective schrodinger
equation with experimental data. in the current example such data is only gedanken.

a convenient way of writing the counterterm constant is to make it equal to the negative
of (k1, k2, k3) at some value of  = 0 for a specied conguration of momenta k1, k2 and
k3 plus an arbitrary nite constant denoted c0. a suitable conguration will be dened in the
next section. here we shall denote a selected conguration by (k10, k20, k30).

thus, the counterterm required in the initial hamiltonian reduces the initial coupling con-

stant g/2 in eq. (2.7) to

g
2

+  =

g
2  [0(k10, k20, k30) + c0]

.

(3.9a)

using eq. (3.8) we see that the initial coupling g is replaced by the new -dependent quantity

g = g"1  g2

3

4(4)3 log



m0# + o(g5)

.

(3.9b)

15

with certain constant m0. thus, the theory is asymptotically free. our result agrees with liter-
ature, say eq. (7.1.26) from [28], in the sense that when we change , the change required in
the coupling constant in the initial hamiltonian for obtaining -independent eective hamilto-
nians matches the change implied by feynman diagrams and dimensional regularization. this
issue will be farther discussed below.

having derived the structure of counterterms we can proceed to evaluation of the nite

similarity ow of eective hamiltonians towards small widths .

4. running coupling constant

our procedure for evaluating the running coupling constant in hamiltonians follows theory
from [3] and [4] using [14]. the procedure has been outlined in a matrix model example in [15].
here, we obtain boost-invariant results and we use creation and annihilation operators instead
of hamiltonian matrix elements.

the initial hamiltonian interaction term contains the regularization factor r and also
depends on the cuto  through the coupling constant g which replaces g according to eqs.
(3.9a-b), i.e.

g = g  2 [0(k10, k20, k30) + c0]

.

(4.1)

the factor 2 is needed because g/2 appears in the hamiltonian. both 0(k10, k20, k30) and c0
are proportional to g3.

evaluation of 21 in eq. (3.6) leads now to a nite expression which has a limit when
  . we consider the integrand factor (k1, k2, k3) in eq. (3.6) in that limit. thus, the
eective interaction takes the form

h21 = z [k1k2k3] 2(2)55(k1 + k2  k3) f[(k1 + k2)2, k2

3] v(k1, k2, k3) a

k1a

k2ak3

, (4.2)

where v(k1, k2, k3) = g/2+(k1, k2, k3) is the eective vertex function and f is the similarity
vertex form factor. (k1, k2, k3) is proportional to g3 and our calculation is done to this order
of accuracy only.

in order to dene a running coupling constant we have to choose the conguration of mo-
menta, (k10, k20, k30). any conguration can be used since the coupling constant counterterm is
independent of momenta. the particular choice we will adopt here is suitable for the massless
case, i.e.  = 0, and it is not practical for  > 0. but since apart from changing the momen-
tum conguration the mass introduces no alteration in our procedure and does not change its
boost-invariance properties we will limit details of our presentation to the simplest massless
case using a special conguration. other choices of the momentum conguration are equally
possible but the one we choose here is particularly suitable for executing integrals over the

16

3 = k+

20 = x20k+

loop momenta and extracting the asymptotic running coupling dependence on the width 
analytically. expressions for (k1, k2, k3) in general case of   0 are given in appendix.
in the massless case, the most convenient conguration is: k+
10 = x10k+
3 with x10 = 0, so
that k+
20 = k
3 . this conguration implies
that the relative transverse momentum, 
2 = 0 (although for massive particles
12 6= 0 in 3
one considers 1 > x1 = 1  x2 > 0 but there is no compelling reason to consider 
theory). note that the parent momentum k3 is arbitrary and not limited by our choice of the
momentum conguration. such possibility is not available when one considers specic matrix
elements or when boost invariance is violated by the renormalization group procedure.

10 = 0 while k
1  x1k

3 and x20 = 1, and k

12 = x2k

the value of 2v(k10, k20, k30) for the above conguration, denoted by g = 2v(0, 1, 1), is

called a running coupling constant. this means

suppose that for the chosen value of  = 0, the running coupling constant takes the value
g0 = g0 determined by comparison with experiment. then,

g = g + 2(0, 1, 1)

.

(4.3)

inverting this series expansion we obtain

g0 = g  2c0 + o(g5)

which can be inserted into eq. (4.3) to yield

g = g0 + 2c0 + o(g5
0)

.

,

thus, the vertex function in the eective interaction in eq. (4.2) is equal

g = g0 + 2 [(0, 1, 1)  0(0, 1, 1)] + o(g5
0)

.

v(k1, k2, k3) =

(4.5)

(4.6)

(4.7)

where in (k1, k2, k3) and 0(0, 1, 1) the initial g is replaced by g0. this change is inconse-
quential here since the dierence between g and g0 is of order g3
0 and the resulting change is
included in terms o(g5

0).

this equation demonstrates the same result for the  function in the case of hamiltonian inter-
actions as obtained for lagrangians using feynman diagrams and dimensional regularization
and replacing the renormalization scale by the hamiltonian width . this is encouraging but
one needs to remember that for comparison of perturbative scattering amplitudes in hamilto-
nian and lagrangian approaches it is necessary to make additional calculations and at least of
fourth order in g. beyond model matrix studies such as in [15], 4th order similarity calculations
have so far been carried out only in simplied yukawa model by mas lowski and wieckowski
[29].

integrating eq. (4.10) one obtains ( = g2/4)

 =

1 + 0(3/322) log /0

,

(4.11)

which shows our result for a boost invariant running coupling constant in eective hamiltonians.
our procedure explains how the running coupling constant can be included in quantum me-
chanics of eective particles, which is given by the schrodinger equation with the corresponding
hamiltonian h.

5. conclusion

a remarkable result of the whole procedure in the case of asymptotically free scalar dynamics
is an extremely simple structure of counterterms and a complete control over involved eective
interactions, in perturbation theory. our operator calculus preserves cluster properties and
allows for evaluation of eective hamiltonians without limitation to any particular set of matrix
elements.
in other words, we can easily derive integral expressions for matrix elements of
eective hamiltonians in the whole fock space spanned by basis states of eective particles.
the renormalization group equations are integrated analytically using gaussian similarity form
factors. also, the unitary nature of the similarity transformation for eective particle creation
and annihilation operators removes wave function renormalization constant from the procedure.
thus, we arrive here at a welcome [7] possibility that the structure of counterterms in the
initial light-front hamiltonian of the 3 theory may be actually simpler than in the lagrangian
used in feynman rules for evaluating s-matrix elements. if it were the case to all orders we

18

would have found a perturbative hamiltonian way to dene the corresponding quantum eld
theory for innitesimally small interaction strength. such theory would provide a starting
point for deriving schrodinger dynamics of eective particles. it is important then to extend
the calculation to higher orders than reported here and other theories. light-front power
counting cannot exclude ratios of longitudinal momenta in ultraviolet counterterms and this is
why explicit calculations help.

the renormalization group ow for hamiltonians diers from standard procedures applied
to s-matrix. the key dierence from standard procedures is that the running coupling constant
is derived as a coecient in front of a certain term in an eective renormalized light-front hamil-
tonian instead of a lagrangian term or in a scattering amplitude. the advantage of knowing
an eective hamiltonian is that not only one can attempt to describe scattering processes but
also bound states using the corresponding eigenvalue equation.

note that the light-front form of relativistic quantum eld dynamics re-denes the vacuum
problem in a way that is only partly understood.
[7] [26] but the present calculation shows
that running coupling constant calculations can be consistently carried out in lowest orders of
perturbation theory without inclusion of perturbative modications of the vacuum state. this
leads to a new demand for similar perturbative analysis of theories that may include eects
usually thought to be associated with ground state properties, the closest being a scalar theory
with quartic interaction term.

obviously, a separate treatment of gauge theories is necessary for many reasons but, in
particular, because they require an additional cuto limiting the longitudinal momentum frac-
tions from below. the small-x cuto appears in the unitary transformation u as well as in
the transformations u1u 
2, the former depending on and the latter being independent of the
ultraviolet cuto . this dierence between the small-x cuto and the ultraviolet cuto cannot
be studied in the case of scalar elds discussed in the present paper. however, the third order
boost-invariant similarity factors we derived in the case of 3 are of more general character and
directly apply, for example, in calculation of a triple-gluon vertex in eective qcd.

finally, we wish to stress the dierence between the regularized initial hamiltonian for
bare particles and the small width hamiltonian for eective particles, which contains similarity
form factors f. the form factors dampen interactions changing invariant masses by more
than  and thus can tame the spread of eigenstate wave functions for low lying eigenvalues
into regions of high relative momenta of constituents. this feature may lead to exponential
convergence of the eigenstate expansion in the eective particle basis. such convergence is
not expected in the case of bare particles. the ne structure of eective particles would then
unfold in the transformation u1u 
2 relating eective degrees of freedom at two dierent scales,
one corresponding to the binding scale and the other to the high momentum transfer probe in
question. this picture encourages the authors opinion that the present calculation provides a
pattern worth application to realistic theories.
