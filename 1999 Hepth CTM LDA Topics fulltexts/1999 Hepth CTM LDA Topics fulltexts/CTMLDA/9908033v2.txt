abstract

grand canonical ensemble of small vortex loops emerging in the london limit of the eective
abelian-projected theory of the su(3)-gluodynamics is investigated in the dilute gas approxima-
tion. an essential dierence of this system from the su(2)-case is the presence of two interacting
gases of vortex loops. two alternative representations for the partition function of such a grand
canonical ensemble are derived, and one of them, which is a representation in terms of the integrals
over vortex loops, is employed for the evaluation of the correlators of both kinds of loops in the
low-energy limit.

in a recent paper [1], the grand canonical ensemble of small vortex loops, existing in the
abelian higgs model, have been investigated. such loops are nothing else but the 4d analogue
of the vortex dipoles, which are present in the usual ginzburg-landau theory. in particular, it
has been demonstrated that the summation over the grand canonical ensemble of small vortex
loops leads to an eective sine-gordon type theory of the massive kalb-ramond eld [2] (cf. 2d-
and 3d cases studied in refs. [3, 4]). this eld describes a dual vector boson, which therefore
acquires an additional mass due to the debye screening in the gas of vortex loops. furthermore, a
representation of the partition function of such a gas directly in terms of the integral over vortex
loops as well as the related eective potential of those have been discussed. such a representation
then turned out to be useful for the evaluation of the bilocal correlator of vortex loops in the low-
energy limit. these calculations demonstrate the importance of treating the topological defects
in the abelian higgs model and ginzburg-landau theory as forming the ensembles, rather than
individual ones.

an interest to the study of vortex loops in the abelian higgs model is motivated by the fact
that the dual abelian higgs model is discussed to be relevant to the description of connement
in the su(2)-gluodynamics [5]. this agreement is based on the method of abelian projections [6]
(for a recent progress see [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], for a review see [16]) and the so-called
abelian dominance hypothesis [17], according to which o-diagonal (in the sense of the cartan
decomposition) degrees of freedom are inessential for connement and can be disregarded.
in
the spirit of this hypothesis, the following partition function describing an eective [u(1)]2 gauge
invariant abelian-projected theory of the realistic su(3)-gluodynamics has been proposed [18] 1

clearly, these operators are non-hermitean in the sense that (ea) = ea. for bookkeeping
purposes, it is worth listing the remaining commutation relations, completing the lie algebra,
which read

[ea, eb] =

abcec and [ea, eb] = ab~a ~h.

notice also that due to the fact that the original su(3) group is special, the phases of the three

3

pa=1

magnetic higgs elds are not independent and should obey the constraint

a = 0. the latter

one has been imposed by the introduction of the corresponding -function into the functional
integral on the r.h.s. of eq. (1).

before proceeding with the study of the model (1), it is worth mentioning its certain feature
owing to which this model is not quite adequate to the description of connement in the real
su(3)-gluodynamics. its essence is that the model (1) describes only the sector of the full yet un-
known abelian-projected theory of the su(3)-gluodynamics, where antimonopoles are completely
absent. clearly, the expected full theory should contain the antimonopole sector as well. possible
interference between these two sectors is up to now unclear and should be claried by further
investigations.

in what follows, we shall be interested in the study of the model (1) in the london limit, i.e.,
the limit of innitely large higgs coupling constant . analogously to the su(2)-case, in this
limit the model under study allows for an exact reformulation in terms of the integral over closed
abrikosov-nielsen-olesen type strings [19] 2. in this limit, the radial parts of the higgs elds can
be integrated out, and the partition function (1) takes the form

(2)

next, the total phases as of magnetic higgs elds should be decomposed into the singular and
regular parts, a = sing
[12, 13, 14] (cf. also refs. [20, 21, 15] for the su(2)-case). here,
sing
s describe a certain conguration of electric strings and are unambiguously related to their
a
world-sheets as according to the equation (see the above cited refs.)

this equation is just the covariant formulation of the 4d analogue of the stokes theorem for
the gradient of the eld a, written in the local form. in eq. (3), x(a)()  x(a)
 () is a vector
parametrizing the world-sheet a with  = (1, 2)  [0, 1][0, 1] standing for the two-dimensional
coordinate.
conning and topological properties of the model (2) have been studied in refs. [12, 13, 14].
this has been done by making use of the so-called path-integral duality transformation, elaborated
in refs. [4, 20] for the usual abelian higgs model, which casts the partition function (2) into the

the aim of the present letter is to treat abrikosov-nielsen-olesen type strings in the model (2)
in the sense of the grand canonical ensemble of small vortex loops, rather than as individual (i.e.,
noninteracting) ones. to understand why one might expect in this case the appearance of some
nontrivialities w.r.t. the abelian-projected su(2)-gluodynamics, let us begin with considering
noninteracting vortex loops. this can be done by gauging the eld aa
 away from eq. (4) by
performing the hypergauge transformation ha
integration over the kalb-ramond elds (see the rst paper from ref. [15] for details of this
integration). the result has the form

vortex loops in the model under study from that in the abelian-projected su(2)-gluodynamics [1].
namely, the system has now the form of two interacting gases consisting of the vortex loops of
two kinds, while in the su(2)-case the gas was built out of vortex loops of the only one kind.

analogously to that case, we shall treat such a grand canonical ensemble of vortex loops in
the dilute gas approximation. according to it, characteristic sizes of loops are much smaller
than characteristic distances between them, which in particular means that the vortex loops are
short living objects. then the summation over this grand canonical ensemble can be most easily
performed by inserting the unity

into the r.h.s. of eq. (5) (with a
) and representing the -functions as the
integrals over lagrange multipliers. then, the contribution of n vortex loops of each kind to the
full grand canonical ensemble takes the following form

as we now see, an essential property of the obtained sine-gordon theory, which distinguishes it
from an analogous theory describing the grand canonical ensemble of vortex loops in the abelian-
projected su(2)-gluodynamics [1], is the presence of two interacting kalb-ramond elds, while
in the su(2)-case there was only one self-interacting eld. notice that upon the expansion of the
cosines on the r.h.s. of eq. (13), it is straightforward to see that only the interaction terms of the

type (cid:16)h1

(cid:17)2n(cid:16)h2

(cid:17)2k

survive. in another words, despite of the mixing of the kalb-ramond elds
in the arguments of the cosines, no terms linear in any of these elds appear in the action. in
particular, the masses of both kalb-ramond elds, m1 and m2, can be read o from eq. (13) by
expanding the cosines up to the quadratic terms. the result reads m 2
a2, where
2 2 are the debye masses, and we have introduced the corresponding

this result illustrates how the vortex loops in the grand canonical ensemble under study are
correlated to each other. namely, their correlators decrease according to the yukawa type law
with the screening provided by the lightest of the two full masses, m2.

in conclusion, we have demonstrated that the grand canonical ensemble of vortex loops in the
eective abelian-projected theory of the su(3)-gluodynamics (being treated in the dilute gas ap-
proximation) exhibits an essential property distinguishing it from the one of the abelian-projected
su(2)-gluodynamics. namely, it consists of two interacting subsystems, corresponding to two in-
dependent types of strings, which emerge after the abelian projection. an average over the shapes
of the vortex loops with the most general rotation- and translation invariant integration measure
leads to two alternative eld-theoretical representations of such a grand canonical ensemble. first
of them is a representation in terms of an eective sine-gordon theory of two interacting kalb-
ramond elds (13). it yields the (positive) contribution to the masses mas of the kalb-ramond
elds coming about from the debye screening as well as to the magnetic charges qas of these
elds. the other representation given by eqs. (10) and (11), which is the one in terms of the inte-
gral over the vortex loops, is useful for the evaluation of their correlators. while such a calculation
is dicult to perform exactly due to the complicated form of the eective potential of the vortex
loops (11), it turns out to be possible to perform it in the low-energy limit within an additional
approximation when only the real branch of the potential is taken into account. as a result, the
correlators of vortex loops have a yukawa type asymptotic behaviours at large distances with the
screening governed by the lightest of the two full masses of the kalb-ramond elds.

it now looks reasonable to nd eld-theoretical representations for the grand canonical ensem-
bles of vortex loops emerging after the abelian projection in the general su(n), n > 2, case.
in that case, there appear n (n1)
indeed, this is just the number of
possibilities for the eigenvalues of a certain (adjointly transformed) operator, to be diagonalized
during the abelian projection, to coincide, minus one constraint imposed by the -function on
the r.h.s. of eq. (1) (with the sum over a going from 1 to n). it will therefore emerge just this
amount of interacting gases of vortex loops, leading to dierent debye masses. the study of this
system as well as its large-n limit will be the topic of a separate publication.
