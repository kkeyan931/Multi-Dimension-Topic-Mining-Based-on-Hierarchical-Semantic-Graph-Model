abstract

we investigate a family of solutions of type iib supergravity which asymptotically approach
ads5  s5 but contain a non-constant dilaton and volume scalar for the ve-sphere. these
solutions preserve an so(1, 3)  so(6) symmetry. we discuss the solution in the context of
the ads/cft correspondence, and we nd that as well as running coupling from the nontrivial
dilaton, the corresponding eld theory has no supersymmetry and displays connement at least
for a certain range of parameters.

1 introduction

one of the most interesting aspects of the ads/cft correspondence[1, 2, 3] is its potential as
a theoretical tool to study real world qcd nonperturbatively[4, 5]. in the context of string
theory where the ads/cft duality is best understood, simple backgrounds are typically both
supersymmetric and conformally invariant. in order to make progress in investigating real world
qcd, it is necessary to construct models in which both of these symmetries are eliminated.
the initial suggestion[4] in this direction was to compactify a higher dimensional theory with
nonsupersymmetric boundary conditions. the additional fermions and scalars in the eld
theory acquire large masses leaving the gauge elds as the only low energy degrees of freedom.
in this way, ordinary four-dimensional yang-mills theory can be studied through an m5-brane
construction, and similarly d3-branes can be used to investigate three-dimensional yang-mills
[4]. this proposal was extensively studied [6, 9, 7, 8] but there are problems in decoupling the
massive modes in a regime where the supergravity calculations can be trusted.

another promising suggestion[10] was to study d3-branes in nonsupersymmetric string the-
ories. in these cases it is found that, despite the presence of a bulk tachyon, the throat or near-
horizon geometry of various d3-brane congurations produce stable supergravity solutions,
and further that these solutions display interesting qcd-like behaviour. various investigations
[10, 11, 12, 7] have shown that these theories often reproduce log-scaling of the gauge coupling
in the ultra-violet. a drawback, however, is the that it is dicult to connect uv solutions with
ir solutions without a considerable amount of ne tuning, and even when this can be done the
ir solutions are usually (but not always [12]) dominated by  corrections.

another approach is to consider other nonsupersymmetric backgrounds within the context
of the usual type iib superstring theory. one can preserve the poincare invariance of the eld
theory by exciting scalar elds in the supergravity background. this corresponds to exciting
scalar operators in the dual conformal field theory (cft). such constructions have been
presented in refs. [13, 14, 16, 15]  similar supersymmetric constructions may be found in
ref. [17]  and it has been found that the dual eld theories do indeed exhibit qcd-like
behavior.
in these examples [13, 14, 16, 15], evidence was found for both connement and
running of the gauge coupling. in this paper, we continue this line of investigation with the
examination of a new two-parameter family of solutions of the type iib supergravity equations
which are asymptotically ads5  s5 but contain two nonconstant scalars: the dilaton and the
volume scalar for the ve-sphere. in these solutions, supersymmetry and conformal invariance
are both broken by the presence of the nontrivial scalars. they also display interesting qcd-
like behavior, a running gauge coupling and connement in the infra-red. the latter is signalled
by an area law for wilson loops and a mass gap in the glueball spectrum, at least for a certain
range of the parameters. one property that distinguishes the present solutions from those
considered in refs. [13, 14, 16, 15] is that we can demonstrate that they are realized as the
throat-limits of asymptotically at d3-brane space-times.

our paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we describe the new two-parameter family
of solutions of the ten-dimensional supergravity equations.
in section 3, we show that this
geometry produces an area law for wilson loops. section 4 addresses the issue of a mass gap,
and in section 5, we discuss our results and consider the dual eld theory interpretation of these
solutions.

2 background solutions

in this paper we will investigate a two-parameter family of ten-dimensional solutions of type
iib supergravity. the einstein-frame metric is given by:

ds2 = h1/2 1 +

24

r4 !/4
+h 1/2 1 +
where h = 1 +

dr2

(dt2 + dx2 + dy2 + dz2)

r4(cid:17)1/2
(cid:16)1 + 4

(1)

these solutions are parameterized by two constants:  which has the dimensions of length,
and  which is dimensionless. we will assume without loss of generality that  is positive, and
requiring the metric to be real requires that  is also positive. the dilaton is given by:

e2 = e20 1 +

24

r4 !

where 0 is an arbitrary constant, and the exponent  must satisfy

2 + 2 = 10 .

the electric components of the rr ve-form are determined by the potential

a(4)
elec =

h1 dt dx dy dz

(2)

(3)

(4)

where 2 = 8g with g being the ten-dimensional newtons constant. the remaining mag-
netic components are determined by requiring f (5) = f (5). one can express the result as

f (5) =

24

 (cid:16)(s5) + (s5)(cid:17)

(5)

where (s5) is the volume form on a round ve-sphere of unit radius.

in the following, it will also be useful to have the string-frame metric, which is given by:
gm n = e(0)/2gm n where gm n and gm n are the string-frame and einstein-frame metrics,
respectively. hence the metric in the string-frame becomes

ds2 = h1/2 1 +

(cid:16)1 + 4

(6)

asymptotically at large r, the geometry approaches ads5s5 where the radius of curvature

of both the ads factor and the sphere is given by

l4 = 24 .

2

(7)

the usual ads5  s5 solution can be reproduced as a (singular) limit: set  = 1 and then take
  0, while rescaling the boundary coordinates (t, x, y, z) and the inverse string tension .
in either the einstein-frame (1) or string-frame (6), the surface r = 0 is time-like, i.e., the
tangent space contains a time-like direction. we also note that proper distance is nite in
going from r = 0 to nite r along a radial line. investigating curvature invariants such as r or
rklm n rklm n , one nds that they diverge as r  0, and hence r = 0 is a naked singularity.
again, this result applies for both the einstein- and string-frame metrics. in the latter case,
the divergence of the curvature invariants signals the breakdown of the  expansion, and so
one can not trust the precise form of the solution in this vicinity as a string theory background.
one can also see the singularity at r = 0 by checking simpler invariants involving the dilaton
eld. for example, as r  0,

m  m

(8)

using the string-frame metric (6). setting  = 0 in the exponent above yields the result for
the einstein-frame (1). this expression diverges for any of the allowed values of , independent
of the sign of . this divergence also indicates the breakdown of the  expansion near r = 0.
one nds that the ricci scalar displays precisely the same divergent behavior as r  0. of
course, the result in eq. (8) vanishes for  = 0 (i.e.,  = 10) since the dilaton (2) is constant.
turning to eq. (2), one sees that for positive  the string coupling e diverges as r  0.
hence in this case, the string loop expansion is uncontrolled near r = 0, providing an additional
reason that the detailed form of solution can not be trusted in this vicinity. on the other hand,
for negative , the string coupling vanishes as r  0.

the new solutions break all of the supersymmetries as can be seen by the transformation

of the supergravity spinors[18]

m m   =

rr  .

(9)

hence there can be no killing spinor solutions for  = 0. of course, this variation vanishes in
the case of a constant dilaton (i.e.,  = 0), and so one would have to consider the gravitino
variation. we will not pursue this case further here.

given the pathological behavior at r = 0, a complete understanding of these solutions and
the dual eld theory requires a full knowledge of string theory. in many cases, however, we
will be able to extract the interesting physics while only considering regions where supergravity
is reliable. we can trust the supergravity approximation as long as curvature scales are large
compared to the string scale, and the string coupling is small. as a prerequisite then, we will
require in the asymptotic region

recall that the former quantity is related to the t hooft coupling

in the ultraviolet regime for the u(n) gauge theory.

since the present family of solutions dier from ads5s5 by virtue of nontrivial excitations
of the dilaton, the volume scalar for the ve-sphere and components of the ve-dimensional met-
ric, one expects that in the dual n = 4 super-yang-mills theory, expectation values for various
operators, such as tr(f 2), have been turned on. from the eld theory point of view, these
expectation values break the conformal invariance and the supersymmetry. this in turn pro-
duces a running of the gauge coupling and connement in the infra-red, as we will demonstrate
below.

3 quark-antiquark potential

the rst test of connement that we carry out is the calculation of the quark-antiquark
potential[19, 20, 21]. the standard procedure is to minimize the nambu-goto action for a
fundamental test string in the background given above. the action is,

s =

1

2 z d2q det gm n axm bxn

(12)

where gm n denotes the string frame metric (6).

we are interested in nding a static solution to the equations of motion so it is convenient

to set 0 = t and 1 = x, and assume y = z = 0. with these choices, the action becomes

s =

(14)

if n(r) possesses a global minimum at some position rmin then a long string situated at this
minimum is a solution of the equations of motion. it is straightforward to show that n(r) does
have a global minimum located at

r4
min =

(15)

for  > 0 and   5. (above, we have added the absolute values in this formula for later

considerations.) the idea here is that when the end-points of the string are widely separated
at the boundary of the ads space, the string will fall into the interior of the space and settle

4

at rmin [14]. so evaluating the action for large separations, one would nd a linear quark
anti-quark potential,

v (x) 

with

n(rmin)

x =

(16)

where the coordinate distance x between the string endpoints corresponds to the separation
between the quark and anti-quark in the background geometry of the dual eld theory. further
using the above denition of the gauge coupling (11), the qcd string tension can be written
as

.

(17)

the linear quark-antiquark potential is then evidence for the connement of electric charge in
the dual gauge theory.

of the asymptotic ads region, given by eq. (7). note that as  approaches zero, rmin is getting

large and as   5, rmin  0.

we should note that the validity of our calculation depends on rmin being far from the origin
since, as discussed above, the supergravity approximation is not valid in this vicinity. from
eq. (15), we nd that rmin is of the order of  for small values of , and that rmin  0 as   5.
for  > 5 or  < 0, n(r) has no minima at nite r. rather it monotonically decreases to zero
at r = 0 for this parameter regime. plotting the ratio of rmin and the asymptotic ads radius l

figure 2: plot of l2((rmin))2 (vertical axis) versus . here (r) is the background dilaton
(2), and l is the asymptotic ads scale (7). the gure suggests that the  expansion is breaking
down at rmin for  > 2.

in g. 1, we see that for  < 2 (and  > 0), rmin is roughly of the order of l, which is assumed
to be large. hence we expect that our results are reliable for this parameter range. for  > 2
or  < 0, we can not draw any quantitative conclusions about the quark-antiquark potential
without going beyond the supergravity approximation. one might observe the trend, however,
that the qcd string tension (17) is decreasing as  approaches 5 (and hence, at the same
time, approaches ). note that curiously the limiting value is tqcd|=5 = 1/(2), which is
precisely the fundamental string tension in at empty space.

we checked the previous expectations with gs. 2 and 3. fig. 2 shows that ()2 is well
behaved at rmin for  < 2, but that for larger values, the  expansion is breaking down in the
vicinity of rmin. hence our results calculated in the supergravity approximation are not reliable
for these large values of . similarly, g. 3 shows that over the range 0 <  < 2 (with  positive)
the string coupling at rmin is roughly the order of the asymptotic value, which is taken to be
small. however, for larger values of , the position of the test string strays into regions where
the string loop expansion is uncontrolled, and hence the details of the supergravity solution are
unreliable.

we might attempt to determine the monopole-antimonopole potential[22] by repeating the

above calculation with the action of a d-string which is given by

s =

figure 3: plot of the e(rmin)0 (vertical axis) versus . the vertical axis gives ratio of the
string coupling evaluated at rmin to that in the asymptotic ads region. the plot is made for

positive  = 10  2 in eq. (2). in this case, the gure suggests that the string loop expansion

will become uncontrolled for  > 2.

assuming the static gauge as above, the action has precisely the same form as in eq. (13) except
that the function n(r) is replaced by

n(r) = h 1

2 1 +

4

24

r4 ! 

.

(19)

now for  > 0 as in the case of interest above, n(r) has no extrema for any real values of r.
rather the function n(r) is a monotonically decreasing function of r as the string approaches
the singularity.
if one were to use this result, it would appear that the most energetically
favorable situation is for the string to fall all the way to the singularity where n(r) vanishes
and then to run along the singularity for a distance x before returning to the asymptotic
region of the space-time. this is possible because at r = 0 it costs no energy to separate
the monopoles and the interpretation is that the magnetic charge is screened. however as
discussed, we can not trust this conclusion since the supergravity approximation breaks down
in the vicinity of r = 0.

however, one might also consider the monopole-antimonopole potential for  < 0. in this

case, n(r) does have a global minimum whose position is given by eq. (15) for   5, and so

a linear potential of the form (16) arises for the monopoles in this parameter range. further
note that in this case, n(r) decreases monotonically to zero at r = 0, which is suggestive
of screening of electric charge. hence the quarks and monopoles have interchanged roles for

7

 < 0. mathematically one can see that this result arises because changing the sign of  (i.e.,
  ) precisely interchanges the form of n(r)  n(r) and so trades the fundamental test
string action for that of a d-string. this is to be expected since as can be seen from eq. (2),
   implements the sl(2, z) transformation e  e. hence one might have expected
that the physics of the quarks and monopoles should be interchanged in the two complementary
parameter ranges of positive and negative .

4 mass gap and glueballs

as argued by witten[4], a second useful criterion in establishing connement in the dual gauge
theory is the presence of a mass gap. to demonstrate the existence of a mass gap in the
present case we begin by calculating the mass spectrum for scalar glueballs. the prescription
for performing such a calculation was originally given in ref. [6]. the strategy is to examine the
linearized equation of motion for a scalar eld uctuation  propagating in the supergravity
background, and determine the spectrum of m2 = k2 where k is the four-momentum of the
scalar eld in the boundary directions spanned by t, x, y and z. making the ansatz  = h(r)eikx,
the equation of motion takes the form of a linear second-order ode for the radial prole h(r).
in this section, we will consider two scalars, the axion (i.e., the rr scalar) and the dilaton.
the linearized equation of motion for the axion may be written as

e(0)/2(cid:16)einsteinc + 2(m )(m c)(cid:17) = stringc = 0

while that for the dilaton is

einstein = 0 .

(20)

(21)

thus the axion propagates as a free eld on the string-frame geometry, while the dilaton
uctuation does so on the einstein-frame geometry. we can use this to our advantage in
calculating the spectra of the corresponding glueballs simultaneously. notice that setting the
parameter  = 0 reduces the string-frame metric (6) to the einstein-frame metric (1). thus
we can analyze the axion equation (20) and by setting  = 0 obtain the results for the dilaton
for free!1 making the ansatz c = h(r) eikx, the axion equation (20) becomes

stringc =

f (r) =

g(r) =

h(r)

r4 (cid:17)(1)/2

(r4 + 4)5/2

(22)

(23)

one can check that the dilaton equation (21) agrees with (22) upon setting  = 0.

applying the methods of refs. [7, 8], we change variables to r = ey and redene the eld

h(y) = (y)(y) so that the equation is schrodinger-like:

1it should be emphasized that this is a purely formal statement. in our solution, choosing  = 0 uniquely
xes the parameter  by eq. (3), while in the dilaton equation (21),  is to be understood as a free parameter.

0 =  (y) + v (y) (y)

8

where the eective potential is given by

v (y) = 

(y)
(y)  f (y)
with (y) = (cid:16)e4y + 2(cid:17) 
4  1

(y)
(y)  m2g(y)
2 ey

the primes denote dierentiation with respect to y.

the potential v (y) has the following asymptotic behavior:

v (y  0)  4  a 2m2e2y
v (y  0)  32  b 2m2e2(5)y

(24)

(25)

where a and b are positive constants.

notice that naively for y  0 the m2 term in the potential would diverge to  for
 > 5. however, from eq. (3), one has the restriction that   10 and hence the potential
asymptotically approaches a positive constant for both y  . hence we can expect that
eq. (23) will yield normalizable zero-energy bound states when the potential is appropriately
adjusted by tuning m2, which appears as a parameter in the former. we can obtain the
glueball spectrum in the wkb approximation following ref. [7]. our potential has classical
turning points located at

(26)

(27)

now using the prescription and notation of [8], we nd that within the wkb approximation

m2 =

() = z 



dyqg(y) and n  1

where g(y) is given in eq. (22). note that () is a number of order one  more precisely it
rises monotonically from zero to approximately 2.5 as  ranges from 0 to 10.

this result (27) is reliable as long as the bound state wave function (y) has no or little
support in the region near the singularity, i.e., y  , where the supergravity approximation
breaks down. in eq. (26), the inner turning point will become large and negative when m
becomes large. from eq. (27) and the following discussion, one sees that the latter will occur
for small values of , and so in this case, we cannot reliably conclude that there is a mass gap.
note that for a generic value of , m will also become large when n >> (). in this case,
we can conclude that there is a mass gap, however, we do not have a reliable calculation of
the mass spectrum for very large values of n  where ordinarily the wkb approximation is

most reliable. there is also a problem as   10, for which   0 and hence from eq. (26),
y  . thus   10 would be another range where we could not reliably conclude that

there is a mass gap.

9

however, for most values of  and either sign of , we have a reliable calculation of the
mass spectrum corresponding to the operator t r(f  f ), and we may conclude that there is a
mass gap in the spectrum of these 0+ glueballs of the dual gauge theory.

finally we turn to the dilaton. we were to reduce the above analysis for the axion to
that for the dilaton by setting  = 0. however, we immediately recognize that there is a
problem, in that precisely for this choice the inner turning point is y = , i.e., r = 0.
hence the potential doesnt conne the wave-function away from the singularity, and so the
results in eq. (27) are not trustworthy. hence within the supergravity approximation, we cannot
determine whether or not there is a mass gap in this case.

as a nal comment, we also note that a similar problem arises in analysing the spin-two
glueballs associated with the linearized uctuations of the ve-dimensional (einstein) metric.
in this case it also found that the eective potential for the metric uctuations does not conne
the wave-function away from the singularity, and hence we are again unable to determine if
there is a mass gap for these states or not.

5 discussion

in this paper we have described a new two parameter family of solutions to type iib supergrav-
ity which are asymptotic to ads5  s5, but they contain two non-constant background scalars:
the dilaton and the volume scalar for the ve-sphere. these nontrivial scalar elds serve to
break both the supersymmetry and the conformal invariance of the background. however, an
so(1, 3)  so(6) symmetry is preserved. that is lorentz invariance in the boundary direc-
tions and rotational invariance of the ve-sphere. further the supergravity solutions contain a
naked time-like singularity at r = 0. despite this singularity, we can still reliably show within
the supergravity approximation, that at least for a certain range of the parameters, the eld
theories dual to these solutions exhibit both connement in the infrared as well as running of
the gauge coupling.

we showed that for 0 <  < 2 and  > 0, the new solutions give rise to a linear quark-
antiquark potential, which may be taken as evidence for connement of electric charge. by
ipping the sign of  (which amounts to an sl(2, z) transformation, sending e  e), we
obtain a solution for which the monopoles of the dual eld theory are conned.

as further evidence for connement, we also demonstrated that for all values of the param-

eter , except near   0 or   10, there is a mass gap for uctuations of the rr scalar.

in the dual gauge theory, this corresponds to a mass gap in the spectrum of the 0+ glue-
balls. these calculations are reliable because in the corresponding wave equation, the eective
potential provides a repulsive barrier which shields the singularity. the same eect has been
observed previously for certain black hole solutions in string theory[25]. on the other hand,
no such barrier appears in the linearized wave equations for the dilaton or metric uctuations.
hence determining the spectrum of these elds would require understanding how the type iib
string theory resolves the singularity (if this actually occurs  see below).

the running of the gauge coupling is simply a consequence of the dilaton being nonconstant.
y m = 2e [1]. further one

the yang-mills coupling is related to that in the string theory by g2

10

has the uv/ir relation [23, 24] relating supergravity degrees of freedom at large (small) radius
to those in the eld theory at high (low) energy. one can interpret the asymptotic approach
of the dilaton to a constant value, i.e., e  e0  1/r4, as the ow of the gauge theory to
a uv-stable xed point [13]. further this particular form for the asymptotic behavior of the
dilaton, which is dictated by the supergravity equations of motion, can be translated into a
universal result for the gauge theory beta function [13]



gy m(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)gy m =g

y m

= 4

(28)

where gy m is the value of the gauge coupling at the xed point. one can conrm that the
higher derivatives of the beta function are non-universal [13], depending on the parameter 
for the present solutions.

further considerations of universal behavior in asymptotically ads solutions with nontrivial
scalar elds appear in ref. [26]. to make contact with the discussion there, we must rst identify
the ve-dimensional einstein metric g(5)

 from eq. (1) with

ds2 = e 10

3  g(5)

 dxdx + l2e2 d2
5 .

(29)

where l is the asymptotic radius given in eq. (7). in accord with the prediction of ref. [26], one
nds that to leading order near the singularity this metric takes the form

g(5)

 dxdx  d2 +(cid:18) 

(cid:19)1/2

(dt2 + dx2 + dy2 + dz2) .

(30)

where  is a new radial coordinate. the prediction of this universal behavior relied on being able
to ignore any potential terms appearing in the scalar equations of motion near the singularity,
which is valid for polynomial potentials.
in fact, the volume scalar  has an exponential
potential, as can be seen from its equation of motion [14]

2 =

4

l2 (cid:16)e16/3  e40/3(cid:17) .

(31)

the authors of ref. [26] recognize that an expontential potential could result in violations
of the universal behavior considered there. however, this does not seem to be the case for
the present supergravity solutions. in fact one can easily show that the potential terms are
supressed as r  0. further, as already discussed, we found a linear quark-antiquark potential
for a large range of the exponents appearing in our solutions, which is in accord with the
analysis in ref. [26]. we did not, however, nd the universal glueball spectrum with a mass gap
arising from their calculations. the obvious reason for this discrepancy is that their universal
spectrum arises for a minimally coupled massless scalar propagating on the ve-dimensional
einstein metric. in the present case of type iib supergravity, there is not obviously any such
scalar.
instead we considered the rr scalar (20), which propagates on the ten-dimensional
string metric, and the dilaton (21), which propagates on the ten-dimensional einstein metric.
we only found clear evidence of a mass gap in the former case.

the family of supergravity solutions presented here dier from those in refs. [13, 14] since
the present geometries can be realized as the throat limits of d3-brane metrics which are

asymptotically at. consider the following asymptotically at solutions with the einstein-
frame metric given by

as before, we will also assume that  > 0 and  > 0. one may think of this ve-parameter
solution as describing a nonextremal d3-brane dressed with extra scalar hair associated with
exciting the dilaton eld and world-volume components of the metric. note that as a result of
this hair, the surface r = 0 is generically singular. an exception to this rule is the choice  = 0,
1 = 2 = 3 = 1 and  = 2 for which the solution reduces to the standard near-extremal
d3-brane. the solution (32) was constructed by applying an appropriate set of u-duality
transformations [27] to a hairy vacuum solution of ref. [28].

the corresponding near-horizon solution is constructed by scaling

with   . in this decoupling limit, f  f and so the only change in the form of the solution
is that f  2h with h = f   1 as in eq. (1). hence the metric (32) becomes ds2 = fds

while the dilaton (33) remains unchanged. one may easily verify that in the limit r  ,
eq. (36) approaches the product metric on ads5  s5 with the radius of curvature given as
in eq. (7). this solution is an extension of that studied in the present paper because it is
no longer lorentz invariant in the world-volume directions. lorentz invariance is restored by
setting 1 = 2 = 3 = /4, in which case one recovers precisely the solution in eq. (1).
similarly the asymptotically at extension of the latter solution is produced by making this
choice of exponents in eq. (32) note that eq. (34) agrees with eq. (3) in this case. the new
near-horizon solution may also be regarded as a generalization of those found in ref. [29] by the
addition of the dilaton hair.

12

we now turn to the dual eld theory interpretation of these supergravity solutions. by
examining the precise way in which the solution approaches ads5 s5 asymptotically, one may
determine the expectation values of various chiral operators in the cft [30]. in considering
solutions of the linearized equations of motion around ads space, one can classify the solutions
as modes which are nonsingular on the interior of ads, and those which are nonsingular at
the boundary. for example [3], a massive scalar eld satisfying 2  = m2  has asymptotic
modes

 (cid:18) r

l(cid:19)

0(xa)

with  = 2  4 + m2l2

(37)

for asymptotically horospheric coordinates on ads5. the modes + extend smoothly over the
interior of the anti-de sitter space, but produce singularities at the boundary. the functions
0+ may be associated with source currents for the cft in calculating correlation functions
[3]. the modes  are nonsingular at the ads boundary, but extend to solutions which
are singular on the interior of the space. the functions 0 then yield the corresponding
expectation values, as may be seen from test probes moving in the supergravity spacetime
[30, 31]. as stressed in ref. [32], the fact that these modes become singular (i.e., reach large
values) in the interior of ads means that one must go beyond the linearized equations of
motion to consider nite expectation values. a good example of this behavior are ads black
hole solutions [33]. these are solutions of the full nonlinear supergravity equations of motion,
which asymptotically approach ads space. one can regard the deviations of the metric from
the ads solution as solutions of the linearized gravity equations, and a closer examination shows
that these linearized solutions correspond to modes which become singular in the interior of
ads, which simply indicates that the full solutions enter a nonlinear regime.

in the solutions of interest here, there are essentially three excitations in the asymptotically
ads solution: the dilaton, the volume scalar  and the metric. the massless dilaton couples to
the dimension four operator o4, which is the supersymmetric extension of t r(f 2). in eq. (2)
or (33), one nds that asymptotically the deviation from its asymptotic value gives   r4,
in accord with  in eq. (37) for m2 = 0. hence there is a corresponding expectation value in
the dual eld theory,

ho4 i   4 .

(38)

bfb

from eq. (31), one can conrm that m2l2 = 32 for the volume scalar . this eld couples to
a
the dimension eight operator o8, which is the supersymmetric extension of st r[fa
a)2] where the st r indicates that the u(n) generators associated with each of the eld
(fa
strengths is symmetrized under the trace [34]. one may extract  from either the original
metric (1) or its generalization in eq. (36) using eq. (29). an asymptotic expansion of the
result conrms that   r8 in accord with eq. (37). the corresponding expectation value is
then

finally one may calculate the stress-energy tensor using one of the prescriptions of ref. [32]
or [35]. the deviation of the asymptotic metric from ads space in nice coordinates [32] yields
gab  r2, and the resulting stress tensor for the general solution (36) is

note that this result is traceless in general, i.e., abhtabi = 0, and for the lorentz invariant
solution (1) with 1 = 2 = 3 = /4 the stress-energy vanishes completely!

in refs. [14, 13] it was suggested that the nontrivial dilaton prole in the solutions which he
constructed may be triggered by considering the modied theory in which o8 is added to the
n = 4 super-yang-mills lagrangian. we do not think that this scenario applies for the dual
eld theory of the present solutions or those considered in ref. [14]. despite the appearance
of a nontrivial dilaton and volume scalar in the present solutions, asymptotically these elds
only involve the modes  and in accord with the standard interpretation, these elds are
dual to expectation values of the corresponding operators. having introduced this scale in the
eld theory state, it is natural that fermion and scalar masses would be induced through loop
eects. hence the qcd-like behavior uncovered in our analysis would be a natural consequence.
turning on a microscopic coupling ie.,a constant source current for o8, would correspond to
exciting in  the divergent mode +  (r/l)4, which is absent in the asymptotic expansion
of our solutions. the same is, of course, true for the supergravity solutions in ref. [14].

in general, the modes  decay at the boundary and hence one can expect that the
supergravity solutions will remain asymptotically ads when these modes are excited. that is
introduceing a nite scale through an expectation value does not greatly disturb the cft in
the uv regime. the same would be true of the modes + when m2 < 0 which can consistently
arise in ads theories [36]. these supergravity elds are dual to relevant operators in the cft
[3], which again have a negligible eect in the uv regime.
interesting solutions and their
interpretation in terms of renormalization group ows have recently appeared in the literature
[37]. for m2 > 0, + is asymptotically divergent and so one can expect that introducing a
nite excitation by this mode would destroy the asymptotic ads structure of the supergravity
solution. on the eld theory side, this corresponds to introducing an irrelevant operator, which
is then not suppressed in the uv regime.

we comment on this because for the volume scalar, we can understand how this occurs,
i.e., how + destroys or modies the asymptotic structure of the supergravity solution. let
us begin with the full metric (32) and only perform the scaling limit (35) with large but nite
. that is we do not fully implement the decoupling limit described above. examining the
resulting solution in a regime where  >> (r2/l2) >> 1, one nds that the geometry is
essentially ads5  s5 up to small perturbations. that is there is a scaling regime in which the
dual theory behaves like a conformal eld theory. in particular, examining the volume scalar
there is an additional perturbation

 =

1
42

r4
l4

(41)

which corresponds precisely to the mode + given that m2l2 = 32 for this scalar. also
calculating curvatures, one nds that the results can be presented in an (double) expansion in
r2/l2 (as well as l2/r2) in which the leading terms correspond to those of the ads geometry.

however, with large but nite , as we continue to increase r eventually we reach a regime
where r >  and the perturbative expansion above in r2/l2 breaks down. essentially we have
again entered a nonlinear regime, now at large r, where the analysis of the linearized equations
in the present case, however, we know precisely what the physics
of motion is insucient.
of this nonlinear regime is since we have the full supergravity solutions (32).
in particular,
the + mode does not introduce any divergent curvatures, but it does modify the asymptotic

14

structure of the solution from ads to that of minkowski space. so for example in rm n rm n ,
the divergent series constructed with the perturbative expansion above is resummed into the
full result which in fact vanishes as r  .

thus we see that the irrelevant operator o8 in the cft controls how the near-horizon
geometry expands into asymptotically at space. this discussion then extends the analysis of
ref. [38] where they considered modifying the super-yang-mills lagrangian by the addition of
o8, and gave evidence that this perturbation allowed one to match scattering cross-sections
beyond the near-horizon limit. of course, this discussion in which we do not fully implement
the decoupling limit and how it may be related to introducing a irrelevant operator in the cft
applies in general, and not just to the particular supergravity solutions studied in this paper.

let us return to discuss the completely decoupled near-horizon solution, and in particular we
will consider the lorentz invariant solution (1) which was the focus of our investigation. despite
the fact that above we argued that this solution should interpreted in terms of introducing
expectation values for certain operators in the dual gauge theory, we still ask whether the dual
theory deserves to be called a new phase of the super-yang-mills theory. on the one hand,
we have a lorentz invariant state with zero energy, as indicated below eq. (40). however,
we have nontrivial expectation values, e.g., ho4i  4, which distinguishes this state from
the conventional vacuum of the super-yang-mills theory. there is no immediate contradiction
between the nonvanishing expectation value of ho4i and htabi = 0, even though the expectation
values involve linear combinations of the same operators. because these are normal-ordered
composite operators whose expectation values may be positive or negative, delicate cancellations
can occur in htabi and still leave ho4i nonvanishing  note that it is important that abtab for
the cft in order to avoid a contradiction. it seems clear though that this lorentz invariant
zero-energy state can not be a part of the hilbert space of states built on the conventional
perturbative vacuum.2 hence it would seem justied in referring to the states dual to these
supergravity solutions as new phases of the theory. one may wonder if this new phase represents
an alternative quantization of the n = 4 super-yang-mills theory, and if it produces a fully
consistent, e.g., stable, theory.

from the supergravity point of view, one may regard these solutions as problematic since
they contain naked time-like singularities. certainly in many cases, string theory is able to
resolve singular classical geometries [40]. one should keep in mind, however, that one does not
expect string theory to resolve all possible singularities [41]. for example, one does not expect
the negative energy schwarzschild solution (or its ads cousin, in the present context) to play a
role in a fully consistent superstring theory. it would seem that solutions studied here fall into
this category of problematic solutions with time-like singularities and unusual energies. it
could be that there are various superselection sectors and that the singular solutions are part
of a seperate unstable sector of the theory, as occurs in the standard kaluza-klein framework
[42].

given smooth nonsingular initial data in the supergravity solution, an asymptotically ads
solution would be protected from evolving into a solution resembling those considered here, by
the cosmic censorship conjecture [43]. for example, if one set up a shell of infalling matter
which at the same time carried scalar hair, e.g., dilaton or volume scalar excitations, one would

2we advocate this point of view despite the recent discussion of precursors [39], since the present system

does not involve an localized excitations.

15

expect the hair to be radiated away and that the collapse would produce a conventional black
hole. this may be related to the fact that we could not nd evidence of a mass gap in the
dilaton and metric excitations of the dilaton and metric elds in section 4. that is if the
singularity is resolved by adding matter near r = 0, it could be that the solution is wildly
unstable to radiating away the additional scalar hair. in any event, cosmic censorship would
seem to argue in favour of the present solutions representing, at best, some exotic new super
selection sectors of the sym theory.
