abstract

the central charge for the seiberg-witten low-energy eective action is computed
using noether supercharges. a reliable method to construct supersymmetric noether
currents is presented.

the electromagnetic duality of seiberg-witten [1] relies heavily on the bps mass-formula

m = |z| where z = (nea + nmad)

(1)

is the topological central charge of the n=2 supersymmetry1. in ref. [2] the classical z
was computed and it was conjectured that if the elds belong to the small representation
of the n=2 supersymmetry they should saturate the bps mass-formula, giving m = |z|,
even at the quantum level. but so far the only direct evidence of this is a bps-type
computation [3] of the minimum of the hamiltonian, neglecting fermionic elds2. as
stressed by seiberg and witten, another way to nd the modication to the classical bps
formula is to compute the central charge z from the low-energy u(1) eective action3
because only the massless (and neutral) degrees of freedom contribute to z.

a way to compute the central charge z is from the commutation relations of the super-
symmetric noether charges. the purpose of this paper is to present the result of such
a computation for the low-energy u(1) part of the eective action. the computation is
by no means trivial but at the end the formula (1) is exactly what is obtained. apart
from the result itself, it is illuminating to see precisely how the centre remains formally
insensitive to the quantum corrections.

as for any space-time symmetry, the noether procedure for supersymmetry needs to be
handled with care because of the variation l = v  of the lagrangian density and
we present below a reliable way to write supercurrents taking this term carefully into
account. we also show how to commute the charges, paying due attention to the way
they are expressed in terms of elds and momenta.

in this letter we shall give only a brief account of the computation with special emphasis
on the application of the noether technique to seiberg-witten centre, leaving to later work
a detailed discussion [7]. one of the most important results of the detailed discussion is
that the general form of a supersymmetric noether current is

1duality means (cid:18) ad

a (cid:19)  d(cid:18) ad

a (cid:19) and (nm ne)  (nm ne)d1 where d  sl(2, z).

2the kind of result we are considering also seems to follow from a geometric analysis of the n=2
vector multiplet in ref. [4], where, however, the authors aim there is completely dierent, the fermionic
contribution is not present and there is no mention of noether charges.

3despite the fact that the massive su(2) gauge theory does not have the exact duality symmetry (due
to the presence [5] of the scalar-vector-supereld coupling ev ), one would also like to calculate the z
for this theory, both to check that the u(1) argument given above is correct, and that the freedom to
make a linear shift f (a)  f (a) + ca which appears in the u(1) theory is removed at the full su(2)
level. the su(2) case will be treated in a later paper[6]

where the is are the elds in the lagrangian density l and 
i  l i . we shall call
the  part of the current the rigid part, as this is the only part that contributes for
rigid internal symmetries. in the case of space-time symmetries we also have v , where
l = v  and the variation of the lagrangian density is taken without using the euler-
lagrange equations for the elds. this situation will be familiar to the reader from the
case of space-time translation symmetry where v leads to the well-known term gl in
the energy-momentum tensor4. for supersymmetric transformations the situation is more
complicated simply because v is more complicated and a major part of the task is to
determine this quantity. of course, v is related to the second-last term in the supereld
expansion, but knowing this does not appreciably simplify its computation. a second
task is to write the full j  in terms of elds and their conjugate momenta5. when j  is
written in this way the transformations, the hamiltonian and the central charge can be
obtained from the canonical commutation relations. it is the result of these calculations
that we wish to present in this letter.

for the seiberg-witten centre the relevant formula is

{q1 , q2} = 2i z

ql = z d3xj 0

l(x) l = 1, 2

(3)

where 12 = 1 = 21 is understood, the lie brackets {,} stand for poisson brackets and
the charges q1 and q2 are the generators of the two supersymmetries in n = 2. it
is actually necessary to compute only q1, because q2 can be obtained from it by an
r-transformation i.e. by letting    and v  v. the charges ql come from
the low-energy u(1) eective lagrangian density which in component elds, up to four
fermions and second derivatives of the elds, is given by

l = imh  f(a)[aa +

4in the case of supersymmetry transformations we have to enlarge the space-time to a super-space
with grassmanian coordinates if we want to explicitly see those transformations as space-time. our
approach is based on standard space-time and we do not have an analog of v  = lx therefore we
derived the current by comparing the variation o-shell with the variation on-shell [8].
5the diculty of expressing noether space-time currents, and therefore super-currents, in terms of

elds and their conjugate momenta was pointed out to me by steven weinberg.

where a, , f and v, , d are the chiral and vector n=1 multiplets respectively, we
have chosen the temporal gauge vo = 0, fermions are in weyl notation and f (a) is the
holomorphic prepotential which classically reduces to 1
2  a2, with the complex coupling
constant6  = r + ii = 

82 + i
g2 .

as we wish to compare the classical and eective central charges of the n=2 supersym-
metry, we rst re-obtain the classical result by starting from the classical version of (4),
namely

l = imh   [aa +

by direct inspection we nd for q1 supersymmetry



i 1i =

v

where we have written the conjugate momenta for each of the dynamical elds (in the
temporal gauge for v). thus for the vector eld  = i
2( v  v), where v and
v are the self-dual and antiself-dual projections of v respectively, and for the fermions
 and  are regarded as the elds and ii 0 and ii 0 as their conjugate momenta.
according to (2) the full supersymmetry current and charge then read

1 =  1v + 1

respectively. note that in the total current the scalar terms a1a have canceled.

the charge q1 correctly generates the 1 supersymmetry transformations of the elds:
for vi and  this is obvious; for a we see that 1  contains a and the commutation
gives the right factors; for  and  one has to realize that 1vi contains  and that we
are looking for the transformations of the momenta  = ii 0 and   = ii 0. an
6note that our  is normalized to  /4 of seiberg-witten. note also that we keep  6= 0 only as a

computational tool even if the physics is not aected by it.

important feature to notice is that the noether charges automatically produce the on-shell
transformations [7].

by commuting the charge q1 with the charge q2 obtained by r-symmetry according
to eq. (3) we obtain, as might be expected, a total divergence, namely

{q1 , q2} = z d3xih(22ia + 2v0iad) + 0ijk(j

= 22z d2~  (~a + ~bad)

)(k

)i

(10)

where d2~ is the measure on the sphere at innity, bi = 1
2 0ijkvjk and ad = a is the
classical analogue of the dual of the scalar eld, which in seiberg-witten is ad = f(a).
we have made the usual assumption that  and  fall o at least like r 3
2 and have
implemented the gauss law as an identity.
for the eective lagrangian (4) much more labor is needed to write the variation of l as
a pure divergence[7]. at the end of the computation the rigid current and v  turn out to
be



i 1i = 

v 
1 = 

a1a +  1v + 1 

v +

a1a 

i

22f

(11)

(12)

here again we have written the conjugate momenta of the elds. we notice that the
rigid current is formally the same as in the classical case and that v 
1 diers only in the
last term (containing 2). thus these currents correctly reduce to the ones in (6) and
(7) when the classical limit is taken: f (a)  1
2  a2. however, the formal resemblance
masks the fact that the momenta and f are quite dierent when expressed as explicit
functions of the elds and their derivatives. in particular the conjugate momentum of v
has a much more complicated expression involving all the fermions:
 = i

2(fv  fv)  i2 (f  f ).

according to (2) the full current is then

1 =  1v + 1

(14)

again this charge reproduces the right transformations by simply applying the same
procedure outlined in the classical case and carefully handling the cubic fermion terms,
which recombine to give the on-shell dummy elds [7].

according to eq.
r-symmetry, and nd that

(3) we commute the charge q1 with the charge q2 obtained by

{q1 , q2} = z d3xih(22ia + 2v0iad) + f

= 22z d2~  (~a + ~bad)

0ijk(j )(k )i

(15)

where again we have made the usual assumption that the fermion elds drop o at least
like r 3

2 and have implemented the gauss law as an identity.

note that the two expressions (10) and (15) have the same form and they only dier
by replacing classical elds and momenta (and their dual) by their quantum counter-
parts. of course this does not mean that the two centres are equal (as is expected to
be the case for n=4 supersymmetry where the beta function is identically zero) but only
that supersymmetry has protected the classical form and therefore the bps mass-formula
equally applies to the quantum case.
finally one has to evaluate (10) and (15) explicitly in the limit a  a and ad  ad
for r   where a and ad are c-numbers, and are non-zero in the spontaneously broken
case. up to an irrelevant numerical scale-factor 7 we obtain

z = nea + nmad

(16)

in agreement with (1).
