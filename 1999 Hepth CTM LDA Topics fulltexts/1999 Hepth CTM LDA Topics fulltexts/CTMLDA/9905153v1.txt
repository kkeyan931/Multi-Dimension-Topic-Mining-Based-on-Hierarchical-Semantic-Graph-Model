abstract

we discuss brane/anti-brane systems by constructing dipole solutions in ar-
bitrary dimension. a detailed illustrative example is worked out for six di-
mensions. we generalise these solutions by exciting extra gauge elds and
generate new solutions by applying various duality transformations on them.
finally an argument is presented on the tachyonic instability by analysing
the string uctuations on the dipole background.

1. introduction

brane/anti-brane pairs have recently played very important role in our
understanding of stable non-bps states in string theory [1]. as a classical
vacuum, brane/anti-brane pair leads to unstable conguration. first of all,
they attract each other as they are oppositely charged. moreover, when the
separation between them is of the order of the string length, there appears
tachyon in the conguration [2]. however, it has been argued in the recent
past that, in certain cases, this tachyon leads the system to a stable xed
point in the renormalisation group sense.

since the classical force between brane/anti-brane system never vanishes,
search for a conguration describing the pair as a classical solution looses its
meaning. however, if we introduce a non-zero background electromagnetic
eld which triggers repulsion between brane and the anti-brane in such a
way that it cancels the attractive force between them, then one would expect
to nd a classical conguration describing the pair in equilibrium3. in [3],
such a solution was constructed in string theory and various instabilities
were analysed. it has been argued that the kaluza-klein (kk) dipole of 5-
dimensional gravity [4] has the property of describing brane/anti-brane pair
when we add required at directions4. an asymptotic magnetic eld appears
naturally which, in turn, keeps the system in equilibrium. to our knowledge,
this is the only classical conguration known for the brane/anti-brane system
till now.

before we go into the detail of our analysis of brane/anti-brane pair let
us rst summerise what we do in this letter. in the rst part of this letter,
we construct the brane/anti-brane pair without adding at directions to the
5-d dipole. this can easily be done as follows. 5-d kk dipole [4] follows
from 4-d euclidean kerr black hole after adding a time direction. however,
from [7], we know kerr black hole solutions in any dimension. thus following
the above prescription, one would expect to get dipole congurations in any
dimension. in suitable coordinate system it is possible to isolate the brane
or the anti-brane that makes up the dipole. the number of world-volume
directions depends on the space-time dimensions of this dipole. interestingly
enough, in this coordinate system (which isolates brane/anti-brane), some of

3it may not be a stable equilibrium though. instabilities due to the tachyon is expected

to be absent if the distance between the pair is large enough.

4on the other hand, some of the dipole like solutions with magnetic ux tubes have
directly been constructed in [5, 6]. however, most of them do not have kk interpretation.

2

the transverse directions of the original kerr-metric translate into the world-
volume directions of the brane and anti-brane. as an illustrative example,
in the next section we discuss such a pair in 6 dimensions. we also discuss
various benets of constructing brane/anti-brane pairs this way (rather than
starting with 5-d dipole and adding at directions). for example, it is easy
to excite the world-volume gauge elds on such a pair. furthermore, we
discuss how, using various conjectured duality symmetries of string theory,
one can construct other brane/anti-brane pairs from the original. in the last
section, we try to understand if these brane/anti-brane congurations (in the
presence of background electromagnetic led) can be realised as stable string
or superstring background at least when the distance between constituents
is large. unfortunately, we nd that they likely lead to unstable string back-
grounds. a string or superstring propagating in these background contains
tachyon in their spectrum.

2. construction of kk dipoles

in order to construct the dipole solution in d dimensions5, we start with

the (d  1)-dimensional kerr metric [7]:
r2 + a2cos2  2mr6d

ds2

(d1) = 

r2 + a2cos2

d 2 

4mr6dasin2
r2 + a2cos2

d d

(1)

+

+

sin2

r2 + a2cos2h(r2 + a2)(r2 + a2cos2) + 2mr6da2sin2i d2

r2 + a2cos2

r2 + a2  2mr6d dr2 + (r2 + a2cos2) d2 + r2cos2 dd5.

note that this metric has horizon(s) when

r2 + a2  2mr6d = 0.

(2)

for d  6, there is a critical value of a beyond which the horizon does not
exists. however, in case of d > 6, for any a and m, there exists one horizon.

5this is similar to the construction of gross-perry dipole [4] for d = 4 and is also

discussed in [8] in dierent context

3

to construct the kk dipole in d dimensions, we perform an euclidean

rotation

  ix,

a  ia,

(3)

and add a new time direction t. the solution thus obtained has the following
form:

ds2 = dt2 + (r2  a2cos2)(

dr2


+ d2) +  sin2 h d2

+h1 (dx  ad)2 + r2cos2 dd5,

where the gauge eld a and the functions h are given by:
2mr6da sin2

r2  a2 cos2 
 + a2 sin2 

,

h =

a =

 + a2sin2

,

and

 = r2  a2  2mr6d,

(4)

(5)

(6)

since the solutions (2) and (4) are time independent, the above construc-
tion is guaranteed to give a solution of the einstein equations and can be
embedded in any theory containing gravity. the fact that this solution in-
deed corresponds to a monopole/anti-monopole bound state can be seen by
looking at the near pole limit.

here, instead of being general, we would look at (4) for d = 6, for reasons

that will become clear later. the metric in 6 dimensions takes the form:

ds2 = dt2 + (r2  a2cos2)(

+ d2) +  sin2 h d2

dr2


+h1 (dx  ad)2 + r2cos2 d2.

where

 = r2  a2  2m ,

a =

2masin2
 + a2sin2

.

to avoid the conical singularity at r = a2 + 2m, one must have

0  x 

4m

a2 + 2m

,

0   

ax
2m  2 .

(7)

(8)

(9)

notice that in the limit of large a, the radius in the x direction depends on
the ratio m
a . this is unlike the dipoles in d = 5, where the radius along

4

x at large a is independent of a [3]. the very presence on this solution for
arbitrary a and m itself suggests that the constituents that makes the dipole
are in equilibrium. due to this twisted boundary condition (9) on , there is
an asymptotic magnetic eld [8]. if we use  =   ax/2m as independent
coordinate, the magnetic eld is given by b = a/2m. 6
to have further insights of the conguration, we will now analyse the
metric at  = 0,  when  vanishes. from the structure it is clear that
the zero of  occurs at r = r0 = a2 + 2m. to analyse the metric near
r = r0,  = 0, we dene coordinates 7

a2 + 2m sin2 =  (1  cos),
2(r  r0) =  (1 + cos),

and look at the limit

a  ,

m  0,

  0,

r  r0

(10)

(11)

(12)

with a sin2 xed and rr0 nite. in this limit, the metric takes the following
form

ds2 = dt2 + d 2 + h 1(cid:16)dx  ad(cid:17)2

+h(cid:16)d2 + 2d2 + 2sin2 d2(cid:17) (13)

with

h = 1 +

m


a = m(1  cos )

m =

m

a2 + 2m

(14)

in (13),  = a2 + 2m with period 0    2a2 + 2m . thus we

see that near r = r0,  = 0, there is a six-dimensional kk anti-monopole
structure. the solution can, in turn, be interpreted as a string like metric
with world-sheet coordinates t, . this anti-monopole has a mass given by m
which depends on both a and m 8. similarly, one can analyse at r = r0,  = .
this gives a metric of a monopole conguration which has the same metric
as (13) with a change of sign in the gauge eld.

6a dierent choice of coordinate will however change the magnetic eld, see [8].
7this coordinate system turns out to be the analogous one that was used in [3] for the

ve-dimensional dipole.

8 this is however unlike the case for d = 4. in this case one gets a anti-monopole near

r = r0,  =  whose mass is independent of a [3].

5

we would now like to make a comment on the supersymmetry. the solu-
tion (4) is not a bps-state and therefore breaks all supersymmetry, in spite
of the fact that it is made out of two supersymmetric solutions. the reason
for this is that each of the constituents breaks half of the supersymmetry,
being precisely the half that the other constituents leaves unbroken. overall
the solution does not preserve supersymmetry. however in the near pole
limit we get a supersymmetry enhancement.

3. new dipoles from dualities

starting from the kk dipole solution (4), we can generate a new dipole
solutions, acting on the rst one by duality transformations. the dipole
will transform under the dualities as each of its constituents, so that the
interpretation of dual dipoles can be found from the transformation of each
single pole. we will do our analysis also here in d = 6.

a rst possibility is to perform a t -duality transformation on (4). as
we have seen earlier, the radius along x asymptotically reaches to m
a for
large a. since t -duality inverts the radius, the t -dual metric will have the
co-ordinate x with very large radius. furthermore, a single kk monopole
goes under t -duality to a solitonic string s1 9, so we expect the dipole (4) to
go to an h-dipole or s1/antis1-conguration. the solution obtained after
acting with t -duality in the x-direction is, in the string frame (see fig. 1,
in the conventions of [9]):

ds2 = dt2 + (r2  a2cos2)(

dr2


+ d2)

+h dx 2 + sin2 h d2 + r2cos2 d2,

(15)

bx =

2ma sin2 
 + a2 sin2 

e2 = h1.

it is not dicult to check that in the near pole limit (12) this conguration
indeed takes the form of an s1-brane, oriented in the -direction.

the special feature about six dimensions is the string/string duality [10],
which relates the strongly coupled solitonic string to the weakly coupled
fundamental string (see fig. 1). applying this duality to the previous solution

9this is the double dimensional reduction of the ten-dimensional solitonic ve-brane

s5, sometimes also called h-monopole.

figure 1: the relation between d = 6 and d = 10 solutions: vertical arrows
imply direct dimensional reduction over a four-torus, dotted lines s-duality
and straight lines t -duality. the dipole solutions, consisting of a bound state
of brane and anti-brane, transform under the various dualities as their se-
parate components.

(15) gives us the fundamental string/anti-string solution:

ds2 = h1ndt2 + (r2  a2cos2)(

dr2


+ d2)

+h dx 2 +  sin2 h d2 + r2cos2 d2o,

(16)

bx =

2ma cos2 
r2  a2 cos2 

,

e2 = h,

which reduces in the near pole limit to the fundamental string solution f 1.
it is not dicult to lift these solutions up to ten dimensions: one only
has to add extra directions by enlarging the solid angle r2 cos2  d2 to
r2 cos2  d2 and extend the dependence of h by taking for  the d = 10-
form of (6). this is equivalent to constructing the kk-dipole directly in
d = 10 and then generate the other dipole solutions by applying the ten-
dimensional duality transformations.

the duality relations applied above are illustrated in figure 1.

4. exciting other gauge elds

in general, a d-dimensional kerr black hole is characterised by [ d1
2 ]
angular momentum parameters [7], where the square brackets indicate the
integer part. in order to obtain a dipole-like conguration with more then
one non-trivial gauge eld, we need to start with the general kerr metric.

7

we illustrate this by starting with the kerr metric in ve dimensions with
two non-zero angular momenta proportional to a1 and a2 [7]:

ds2 =

we then perform the same procedure (3) as before, and obtain the following

(19)

the general analysis of this metric is very complicated. we will restrict
ourselves to the case a1  a2. in this case, the metric structure simplies

8

and can be analysed in a straight forward manner. however, in doing so, we
will miss out important physics which appear at order o(a2) or higher.

in the limit a1  a2, (18) reduces to the following simple form:

ds2 = dt2 + (r2  a2

1  2m and

a =

2ma2cos2
1sin2
 + a2

,

a =

2ma1sin2
 + a2
2cos2

.

in the near pole limit r = r0 and  = 0 the metric reduces to

ds2 = dt2 + d 2 + h(d2 + 2d2 + 2sin2 d2)

(21)

(22)

2a2 m (1  cos) d d + h 1(dx  ad  a d )2

with the expression for the gauge elds given by:

a = m(1  cos),

a  =

m a2


.

(23)

here the parameters r0, m have the same form as before with a replaced by
a1 and a2 = a2/qa2
1 + 2m. this near pole limit suggests that the soliton
at r = r0 and  = 0 is an anti-monopole with a gauge eld a excited in
the world volume direction, proportional to a2. however it is not dicult to
see that this extra gauge eld breaks even in the near pole limit all of the
supersymmetry.

in exactly similar manner, we can study the limit a2  a1.

in this
case, the poles change the position, now located at  = /2 and , 3/2
and the gauge elds interchange their roles. obviously, making the duality
transformations applied in section 3, we can construct other brane/anti-
brane pairs from (20).

5. tachyonic instability

all the solutions that are discused in (4) can be embedded obviously in
any string or superstring theories since they are the solutions of einstein grav-
ity. as a consequence, they can be considered as various string backgrounds.
a natural question thus is to ask if these backgrounds are stable. first thing
in this direction will be to check if string/superstring propagating in these
backgrounds contain tachyons in their uctuation spectrum. the aim of this
section is to carry out an analysis of this issue. in general, string uctuations
in a non-trivial background is hard to analyse. this is because one needs to
have a description of the background in terms of world-sheet conformal eld
theory (cft). the dipole backgrounds that we have discussed earlier have
very complicated eld congurations. however, at very large radial distance
the the structure simplies. fortunately for us, in this regime, the two di-
mensional cft is known and has been analysed in the literature [11]. we
will thus make use of his results.

as an illustrative example, we will work with the solution (4) for d = 5.

the solution can be read o from (4). various parameters are
r0 = m + m 2 + a2.

 = r2  2mr  a2,

(24)

here as before r0 corresponds to the zero of . for our present purpose, we
will also need the periods of x and . their ranges are

4m(m + m 2 + a2)

m 2 + a2

0  x 

,

0   

2a

m 2 + a2

.

(25)

in order to proceed, we rst notice that for r  , the metric reduces to

ds2 = dt2 + d2 + dz2 + 2d2 + dx 2.

(26)

here we have dened  = rsin, z = rcos. thus the metric is at. however,
due to nontrivial periods of various coordinates (25), there is an asymptotic
magnetic eld b given by

b =

a

m 2 + a2

.

(27)

upon reduction over x, we would thus get four dimensional melvin solution
(see [12] for detail).

10

fortunately, melvin background is one of the very few backgrounds where
string world-sheet has a description in terms of cft [11]10. if we denote the
1
radius of x by r (which follows from (25)), then for integer
br , one has
an orbifold cft. the non-trivial part of the cft is a zn orbifold of 2-
dimensional plane times a circle, where n is related to the magnetic eld
of the melvin solution. however, it is known that this cft description for
string or superstring, contains tachyon in the spectrum and the mass formula
is given by m2 = 4 + 4
n [13]. from this observation, we thus conclude
that the dipole solution for d = 5 at large radial distance leeds to unstable
string or superstring background due to the presence of tachyon. we do not
see any immediate complications to generalise this result for d > 5.
