abstract

we examine how to construct explicit heterotic string models dual to ftheory

in eight dimensions. in doing so we learn about where the moduli spaces of the two

theories overlap, and how nonperturbative features leave their trace on a purely

perturbative level. we also briey look at the relationship with ns9branes

1 introduction

over the last few years the idea of string duality has lead to much greater understanding

of the nonperturbative features of string theory, to the extent that we can now visualize

the various string theories as being dierent points in a larger moduli space. most notably

we have learned about the interplay of geometric features in compactication, especially

those based on the rich area of calabi-yau manifolds.

in particular we have learned to relate strongly coupled type iib superstrings in a

background of 24 7branes to heterotic string theory through elliptically bered k3 sur-

faces [1, 2, 3]. however, to date the majority of this work has been very mathematical

[4] in nature with little attention being paid to the explicit duality map. in this letter

we will address this issue. there are several well known and phenomenologically inter-

esting methods of constructing heterotic theories in less than ten dimensions that have

been known for some time, viz.: covariant lattices [5], free fermionic constructions [6],

and asymmetric orbifolds [7]. it can be shown that these are all essentially equivalent [8],

with each method having its own benets and drawbacks.

nevertheless, it is not trivial to determine a map between ftheory and the heterotic

string compactications directly because it is not known to what extent the moduli spaces

overlap. for example, ftheory on k3 has a xed supersymmetry [9], however it is

relatively easy to construct heterotic models in eight dimensions with less supersymmetry.

since ftheory is nonperturbative understanding the map should provide an interesting

relationship between perturbative and nonperturbative aspects of the heterotic string.

in section 2, the basic results needed from ftheory on how to read o gauge groups

with the necessary substructure indicating nonperturbative contributions are outlined.

in section 3, we look at the prescription to recover the purely perturbative heterotic theory

and discuss how to construct the dictionary of the two via the moduli space of type i

theory. in section 4, we conclude the paper with a brief look at how we can relate the

work of this paper to the recent work being done on ns9branes, which are problematic

in string theory but appear to be required by duality arguements.

2 ftheory

ftheory [1] is not a string theory per se, though attempts have been made to dene it as

a 12 dimensional theory with two time dimensions. a much more satisfactory approach

is to consider it as type iib superstring compacted on a sphere (the complex projective

surface) in the background of twenty four 7branes. type iib superstring theory in ten

dimensions has an sl(2, z) selfduality and hence has an associated torus. when this

torus is bered over the sphere in the brane background an elliptically bered k3 surface

is formed, the properties of which are well known. the moduli space is [9]

m = so(2, 18; z)\so(2, 18)/so(2)  so(18)

(1)

and is the same as that of a heterotic string compactied on t 2 using a narain lattice.

since the k3 surface has an elliptic structure its singularity structure can be easily

read o from the weierstrass equation. these singularities have been classied by kodaira

in a way corresponding to the ade classication of lie algebras [10]. it is standard

to accept this correspondence as being exact, i.e. the singularity type corresponds to a

gauge group of the same lie algebra type in the physical theory. however, witten [11]

has shown that this is not necessarily true, though how this works from a heterotic point

of view is not yet fully understood. other algebras can also be constructed using various

congurations of mutually nonlocal 7branes but as they do not coalesce to a single point

they are not of interest here.

recently there has been much work done in understanding how the gauge groups

arise from the k3 surface through the theory of string networks [12]. the singularities

of the k3 surface correspond to the positions of the twenty four 7branes forming the

background in ftheory. we know from work on the related theories of dbranes [13]

that perturbatively there should be only sixteen d7branes. by using seibergwitten

theory, sen [14] showed using ftheory, that the orientifold planes could be formed out

of 7branes which have dierent charges with respect to the ramond and neveuschwarz

sectors. in references [15, 16] it is shown how to combine these mutually non-local branes

2

to provide the states needed to ll out the gauge groups corresponding to the respective

singularities on the k3 surface.

the 7branes are classied by the rr and nsns charges, [p, q], they carry; 7branes

with dierent values of [p, q] are said to be mutually nonlocal. from [16] we will be

only concerned with three types of mutually nonlocal 7branes, denoted a, b, c. if we

have n 7branes of the same type at a singularity then the associated gauge algebra is

su(n). if there are dierent types of branes at a singularity, anabnbc nc, the associated

algebra is su(na)  su(nb)  su(nc). this is actually a maximal subalgebra of a larger

simply laced algebra since extra massless bps states also appear in representations of

the subalgebra and ll out the adjoint of the larger group in a manner analogous to free

fermion constructions [17]. a d type singularity corresponds to a 7brane conguration

of the form anbc; the subalgebra is su(n)  u(1) which is enhanced to a dn algebra.
similarly an e type singularity has a 7brane conguration of the form anbc 2; the

subalgebra is su(n)  u(1)  su(2) which is enhanced to a en algebra. it is the maximal

subalgebras that we are most interested in since they obviously encode nonperturbative

features and point out where bps states should be in the heterotic spectrum.

2.1 the orientifold limit

since the 24 7branes are non-perturbative they will not feature directly in string models

so we need to nd a limit which relates them to a perturbative regime. a method in

going between ftheory on k3 and heterotic on t 2 is to use type i and i models as

an intermediate step [14]. from this point of view the gauge groups in the dn series

are formed by placing n dbranes on an orientifold 7plane, o. that is in going from

ftheory to type i theory we have the 7branes behaving as:

anbc 7 ano

(2)

in collapsing the bc branes to an orientifold, the nsns charges cancel whilst the rr

charges combine to give the correct value for orientifold planes in eight dimensions. the

3

maximal subalgebra enlarges as

su(n)  u(1) 7 so(2n)

the eect of this limit on an e singularity is

anbc 2 7 ano + c

with the maximal subalgebra reorganizing itself as

su(n)  u(1)  su(2) 7 so(2n)  u(1)

(3)

(4)

(5)

thus dual models to ftheory constructions should have enhanced gauge groups built

from these maximal subgroups. the extra states should also be bps. a corollary is that

the corresponding heterotic string we are going to be interested in is hso since it is this

theory which is sdual to type i [18].

in the following we will use hso to denote the heterotic string compactied on the

narain lattice 2,2  16 while he8 denotes 2,2  8  8. though they are the same

theories on compactication, they have dierent wilson lines when it comes to embedding

other gauge groups.

3 heterotic string on t 2

we now turn to building heterotic string models. from duality there are conditions

to be satised; as already pointed out there can be no supersymmetry breaking. the

moduli space is equivalent to that of compactication on a narain lattice, prompting the

restriction to gauge preserving compactications, i.e. total rank is 18, and switching o

background antisymmetric tensor elds. we will assume that all rank 18 gauge groups

appearing on the ftheory side are acceptable, i.e. have a heterotic dual; and that we are

embedding our wilson lines in a lattice of the form 2,2  16 as opposed to 2,2  2

8; a

priori this is due to the dn structure of the maximal subalgebra in the orientifold limit.

the massless vectors belonging to the roots of the underlying gauge group have nl = 0

along with pr

2 = 0, pl

2 = 2. when the winding number is zero this gives the subgroup

of the so(32) surviving breaking by the wilson lines. however, for certain values of ri

then further massless gauge bosons can appear so as to enhance the gauge group. writing

out pr in component form we get

note, that i is now a label and not a component as far as the ak

i are concerned. the third
term in the expansion looks problematic as it has the potential to cause coupling between

the wilson lines. however, our choices of values for the ak

i will actually give zero for the

(13)

where there is no summing over i and (ai)2 is the length of the shortest vector of the form
i = 1  (ai)2/2
then extra massless modes appear allowing an enhancement. what actually has occurred

ai + , where   16. if the radius of compactication is, for each i, r2

here is that the two dimensional case has been split up into to two copies of a single

dimensional compactication. they are also automatically bps.

there are two mechanisms of gauge enhancement: (i) the standard dbrane approach

[13] of clustering branes on top of each other; in the above notation this means identifying

coordinates within the bulk of the fundamental cell so that the generic group u(1)18

becomes g16  u(1)2 with the u(1)2 dependent only on the structure of ; (ii) when the

relationship r2

i = 1  (ai)2/2 is satised for (ai) the shortest length of the wilson line
relative to the cluster of dbranes we wish to enhance. however in the type i and i dual

models the second mechanism is nontrivial and requires the  string discussed in [22].

its position in the moduli space is arbitrary except for gauge enhancing points when its

position satises the above relation relating the radii to the length of the wilson lines.

the  string can be related to the string junctions as its origin in nine dimensions is from

the presence of a d0brane which can couple to d8branes and orientifold planes.

it

satises the condition that the number of neumanndirichlet boundaries on the string is

eight, ie nd = 8 [23]. when we compact down to eight dimensions the d0  d8 system

becomes d1  d7 which still satises nd = 8 and is similar to the string junction system

used in the ftheory duals.

in the work of [22] an investigation of the d0d8 system was made in nine dimensions

where they started o with an arbitrary number, n of d0branes in the presence of d8

branes and o8planes. it was then shown n = 1 was required for stable congurations as

6

in gauge enhancement. when there is further compactication down to eight dimensions

we have n = 2 in the decoupled case2. decoupling basically allows us to take two copies

of the nine dimensional case since we can treat the axes as independent except at the

nontrivial point of the origin where they intersect which is only signicant if there are

branes placed at that point.

in taking the orientifold limit of the en series there was a cbrane left over. never-

theless, it contributes states necessary for the gauge enhancement and does so in a manner

analogous to the states contributed by the  string. we now make the tentative identi-

cation that the string junctions states related to the cbranes are dual to the states due

to the  string and hence the cbrane is itself dual to a d1  d7brane set up in type i

theory (tdual to a d0  d8brane set up in nine dimensions). note, that there appears

to be a choice between which cbrane we should identify with the orientifold and which

with the  string. however, in the d0  d8 set up gauge enhancement occurs when the

d0brane is attached to an orientifold, and likewise here the left over cbrane is still

at the position of the associated orientifold so it is not possible do separate their overall

eects in this picture and the choice does not have to be made. we will return to the

cbrane later when we discuss ns branes in heterotic theory.

for gauge groups of rank 18 there are only a nite number of ways of combining the

en groups for n  6. the only one with three exceptional groups is e 3

6 which has been

handled already in [20]. it also does not satisfy the decoupling feature but we will return

to it later. the rest of the possibilities we can cluster together as en  em  g or en  g

where g is of sucient rank to make the total 18 3. for simplicity we make it a so(2n)

lie group with no further breaking.

looking at the rst case with two exceptional groups, we can make the decomposition

in the orientifold limit:

en+1  em+1  d16nm 7 dn  dm  u(1)2  d16nm

(14)

2it remains to be veried if this will still be the case when the wilson lines are coupled.
3in the former case the rank of g will always be less than or equal to 6. for it equal to 6 we ignore

the possibility it could be e6

7

we can now see that we can associate the two u(1) components to the two circles making

up the compactication torus, each dimension being made responsible for the enhancement

of a particular dn or dm. the single dimensional case has already been dealt with in [21].

for the sake of convenience we associate the dn group with i = 1 and dm with i = 2.

then we can give the wilson lines as

a1 = ( 1

2

n 0m 016nm)

a2 = (0n 1

2

m 016nm)

(15)

these trivially satisfy the condition that they decouple the (pr)i as their product is always

zero. generalizations to g 6= d16nm are straightforward.

when the gauge group is of the form en  g then one merely has to move the

appropriate radius away from the critical point of enhancement in the previous case or

alter one of the ai depending on the form desired for g. the other cases of particular

interest with regard to enhancement, so(36) and su(19) follow as in the one dimensional

case with one of the wilson lines set entirely to zero.

3.1 coupled solutions

we can use the duality of hso with type i to learn more about the structure of the

moduli space of heterotic wilson lines. first examine the the group e6  e6  e6.

this is somewhat anomalous as e6 7 d5  u(1) requires three u(1)s. the solution

is of the form given in equation (15) with n = m = 5. however, in order to get the third

u(1) for the enhancement the wilson lines have the components a16

2 [20].
this violates the decoupling argument above but provides a solution nevertheless. hence

1 = a16

2 =  1

there exist other solutions where the wilson lines do not decouple.

this is the generic case though the e 3

6 one is the only one with enhancing to an

exceptional group that cannot be made to decouple. in this notation the wilson lines act

as the coordinates of a square moduli space of axes a1, a2 such that 0  ai  1
2. each
pair of components of the wilson lines, (a1, a2)k now forms the coordinate of the kth

8

dbrane when it is mapped to a dual type i model in eight dimensions. the orientifold

planes are represented by the corners (0, 0), (0, 1

2) though they only have an
eect if there are dbranes on them; decoupled solutions lie purely on the axes. however,

2), ( 1

2, 0), ( 1

2, 1

this space is only a fundamental cell of a larger lattice and extra massless states can arise,

as in e 3

6, when d-branes are located at special points outside the fundamental cell when

other winding modes become massless. these situations will break the z4 symmetry of

the wilson lines that exist when the dbranes all lie within the fundamental cell.

coupled solutions lie within the bulk and represent the relative diculty of nding

the solution as the positions here are arbitrary, the solutions giving rise to gauge groups

lying on loci as opposed to particular points. for many cases the loci of solutions will

intersect with the boundary and the decoupled form of the wilson lines can be recovered.

a nal set of gauge groups of interest are those of the form dx

m with nx+my = 18.
it can be shown that if x + y  4 then there will always be more than 24 branes required

ndy

on the ftheory side. that is if x + y > 4 then some of the gauge groups would have

to have rank less than 4 and thus are in the a series as opposed to the d, in line with

the fact that in the type i picture there are only four orientifold planes.

in the case

x + y = 4 then the gauge group is d2

4  d2

5 which from the ftheory side is not acceptable

as it would require 26 7branes. on the hso side it would be constructed by placing 4

dbranes on each orientifold plane and choosing the appropriate radii to enhance two of

the d4 to e5 which would give us back the d5 gauge groups. the wilson lines are:

a1 = (04 04 1

2

4

4 1
2

a2 = (04 1

2

4

4

04 1

2

)

)

(16)

the resolution lies in the fact that is not possible to single out only two d4 we want to

enhance and the construction from the heterotic point of view breaks down as well. there

are no other cases such as this so we are justied in the assumption that all rank 18 gauge

groups which can be constructed from ftheory on k3 have an appropriate heterotic dual.

so far we have been concentrating purely on the hso type models.

in theory we

should be able to construct a dictionary for embedding in he8 since it has the same

9

moduli space and is related to hso by tduality. however, there is no simple orientifold

limit as for hso and the wilson lines are nontrivial. a case in hand is e 3

6 which, to build
8 the third e6, we require a su(3)3 maximal subalgebra, the brane structure

up in 2,2  2

for which is not apparent. the generic sl(2, z) transformation to convert the standard

anabnbc nc conguration to a form where the maximal subalgebra reects the embedding

in e8  e8 has not been constructed yet. if the tduality is modied as discussed in the

next section, then it may be the case that this transformation does not exist.

4 comparison with ns9branes and conclusion

in recent papers hull [24] has discussed the existence of ns9-branes in nonperturbative

hso theory. ns9branes are the sduals of the d9branes in type i theory and can also

be deduced from m9-branes in mtheory [25]. their discovery, implied by duality, gives

the same brane structure in the heterotic string that has proved to be so rich in type

i theory. in particular it is not hard to see that the heterotic wilson lines should now

correspond to the position of the 16 ns9branes. this in turn provides evidence that

the map between the wilson lines of type i and hso is exact under sduality; the rr

charge of the orientifolds will change to nsns in hso models.

in deriving the map between ftheory on k3 and hso on t 2 we have implicitly as-

sumed that the abranes of ftheory have the same charge as d7branes. this is not

strictly necessary as what mattered in the above construction was the correct cancellation

and summing of overall charge along with the maximal subalgebra. this is an intrinsic

feature of the ftheory construction as various brane congurations are considered equiv-

alent if they can be related by an sl(2, z) transformation [15]. the sl(2, z) selfduality

of the parent type iib theory includes an sduality. thus the standard anabnbc nc con-
guration can be related to another conguration of charged 7branes, ana bnb c nc, so that

the gauge structure is exactly the same but the nsns and rr charges are interchanged.

hence, when examining the perturbative string models we can only tell the dierence

between hso or type i from the charges of the ftheory conguration we started with.

10

in terms of the moduli space, it provides evidence that hso and type i with all their

permitted wilson line congurations are equivalent up to gauge group/kodaira classi-

cation, and that the subgroup structure discussed above persists under an sduality

transformation. this ties in nicely with the use of truncation techniques on the parent

type iib spectrum in ten dimensions to obtain the type i and hso theories performed

in [26]

in this paper we have constructed an explicit map taking us from the kodaira clas-

sication of singularities in ftheory compactied on elliptically bered k3 surfaces to

the wilson lines in the heterotic so(32) string compactied on t 2, and discussed some

issues arising out of gauge enhancement.
