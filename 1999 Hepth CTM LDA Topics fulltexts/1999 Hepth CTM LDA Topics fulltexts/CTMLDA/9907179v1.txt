we extend polchinskis evaluation of the measure for the one-loop closed string
path integral to open string tree amplitudes with boundaries and crosscaps
embedded in dbranes. we explain how the nonabelian limit of near-coincident
dbranes emerges in the path integral formalism. we give a careful path integral
derivation of the cylinder amplitude including the modulus dependence of the
volume of the conformal killing group.

in this brief note we clarify some important issues stemming from the moduli
dependence of the measure in the open string path integral. we will be primarily
interested in open string tree amplitudes with multiple boundaries and crosscaps
on dbranes. it will suce for the discussion in this paper to consider the simplest
conguration of n+1, spatially separated, parallel and static, dpbranes, arrayed in
a spatial direction, x 25, transverse to the branevolume. upon setting the branes
in relative motion in an orthogonal spatial direction, x 24, also transverse to the
branevolume, the spacetime infrared limit of the amplitude has an interpretion as the
exchange interaction of n+1 dpbranes [2].
in the supersymmetric theory, its low
energy eective description is given by supergravity.

the spacetime ultraviolet limit of dbrane amplitudes remains a puzzle in many re-
spects. the low energy eective theory in this limit is known to be a u(1)n +1 abelian
gauge theory, with goldstone bosons arising from the breaking of x 25 translational
invariance. these appear at the rst massive level in the open string spectrum. in
the limit of n near-coincident dbranes, a non-abelian structure is found to emerge
[1, 4, 5], and the massless open string multiplet is enhanced from n + 1 singlets, each
transforming as a lorentz vector on the p+1 dimensional minkowskian branevolume,
to a singlet plus the n 2-dimensional adjoint multiplet of u(n). the additional mass-
less gauge bosons arise from an enhanced background of zero length dirichlet open
strings stretched between pairs of distinct near-coincident dbranes. the open strings
have denite orientation, giving a total of n(n  1) distinct states. the nonabelian
states play an important role in studies of weak/strong coupling duality in string
theory. it would be helpful to have a description of their dynamics directly in the
world-sheet formalism, beyond that given by the low energy eective theory. in what
follows, we will explain briey how the nonabelian limit of near-coincident dbranes
emerges in the world-sheet formalism. we will also clarify issues relating to the mod-
uli dependence of the measure in the path integral. a more detailed discussion of the
physics of the ultraviolet limit of open string theory is reserved for future work [8].

we begin by clarifying the measure in the open string path integral. the result
follows rather simply from polchinskis evaluation of the one-loop closed string path
integral, a sum over surfaces with the topology of a torus [11]. for surfaces with
negative euler character, with no conformal killing vectors, it is convenient to use
uniformization theory [7] to choose a constant curvature gauge slice in the space of
world-sheet metrics, and a parameterization of the moduli space of metrics that leaves
the measure for moduli in its simplest form [6]. this procedure will be explained in
detail for open string tree amplitudes in an accompanying paper [8]. for surfaces
with the topology of a cylinder, the conformal killing volume is a matter of concern.
we follow the procedure adopted in [11] and retain the moduli dependence in the
ducial world-sheet metric, as opposed to the world-sheet coordinate intervals. a
careful derivation of the moduli dependence of the conformal killing volume then
follows for surfaces of cylindrical topology. this procedure correctly recovers both

1

the annulus amplitude with neumann boundaries, and the exchange amplitude for
a pair of static dbranes. the extension to the supersymmetric exchange amplitude
will be reported upon elsewhere [9].

let us begin by expressing the exchange amplitude between n static bosonic
dbranes as a conformally invariant path integral over worldsheets. surfaces m(b,c)
of
type (b, c) with b boundaries, c crosscaps, and h handles, have euler characteristic  =
2 2h (b + c), and are weighted by a factor g2
open in open string perturbation theory.
to keep things simple, we will for the most part focus on the sum over orientable world
sheets with boundaries, but no handles and/or crosscaps. in this case, the number
of dbranes, n=b + c, equals the number of boundaries, b. we follow the method of
[10] and [11], extending to string worldsheets with boundaries embedded in dbranes.
the separation of parallel dp-branes in a single spatial dimension orthogonal to their
worldvolume breaks the so(1, d) lorentz invariance of the minkowskian spacetime
background to so(1, p)so(0, d  p). let yi be a (d  p) dimensional vector giving
the location of the ith dbrane. we have the boundary conditions:

h

(i) = ym
x m
i ,
(i)ax 
na
(i) = 0,  = 0,   p ,

i = 1,   , b; m = p + 1,   , d

(1)

where ni is an inward pointing normal to the ith boundary circle, ci, i=1,   , b.
the relative locations of the dbranes are assumed xed. in the tdual picture, the
yi correspond to wilson lines wrapped around the compact dual coordinates, x, of
the critical bosonic open string theory compactied on a d  p dimensional torus [2].
the exchange amplitude can be expressed as a polyakov path integral [10] over
orientable riemann surfaces, m, with boundaries, ci, i = 1,   , b, embedded in
parallel dpbranes:

(2)

on which we must impose the boundary conditions in eq.(1). the bare action includes
all local, renormalizable, terms necessary to ensure exact conformal invariance of the
path integral. thus, sren. includes bulk, and boundary, cosmological constants, plus
a term proportional to the euler characteristic of the surface:

(3)

the renormalization constants, [0, 0; (i)
0 ], will be cancelled in the critical spacetime
dimension by divergent counterterms originating in the weyl anomaly of the measure.
the factor in square brackets in eq.(3) is a topological invariant equal to the euler
characteristic, 2, from the gaussbonnet theorem, and  is the geodesic curvature

2

on the boundary. the gauge xed path integral in eq.(2) is required to be exactly
invariant under conformal reparameterizations of the surface including boundaries.
we will use this as a guiding principle in determining the measure for the path
integral.

let ci denote the ith boundary circle with parameterization unspecied; we refer
to this as a physical boundary circle. recall that an arbitrary boundary metric, also
known as an einbein, e(), can be brought to a constant by a reparameterization,
  f (), where  is the circle variable, 0    1, and the only coordinate invariant
property of the circle, ci, is its physical length, li=r 1
0 de(). let gab(;  ) denote
a world sheet metric with xed conformal class characterized by moduli,  , with
corresponding einbein, ei(; li)=g(;  )|ci , on the ith boundary circle. physics

requires us to sum over all world sheets linking the physical boundary circles in the
path integral. we will make this gauge xing procedure on world sheet metrics explicit
below.

we begin with the integration over coordinate embeddings, x m (), with a xed
ducial metric, gab(; i), on the world sheet, and xed einbeins on the boundary

circles, ei=g|ci , for all i=1,   , b. the metric in the tangent space for small varia-
tions, (x m, x ), m=p + 1,   , d,  = 0,   , p, is required to be reparameterization
invariant. normalizing the gaussian integral over innitesimal variations to unity, we
can factor out and perform the integration over constant modes x 
0 = x   x ,
 = 0,   p, where the primes denote nonconstant modes [11]. since we x the lo-
cation of the branes in the dirichlet directions, there are no constant modes to be
integrated over. we regulate the infrared divergence coming from the integration over
p + 1 noncompact directions parallel to the branevolume by putting the system in a
box of volume vp+1:

p

y=0z [dx0] = vp+1

.

(4)

for the dirichlet directions, we change basis to the b  1 distances, |yi  yj|,
i6=j, and the center of mass, yc.m., each a d  p dimensional vector. for spatially
separated branes, we must include the contribution to the classical action, t(ij), for
every i6=j, from open strings stretched between the (ij)th pair of branes. thus, the
static exchange amplitude only depends upon the distances between branes. we can
integrate over the center of mass of the brane conguration to obtain the volume of
the orthogonal (d  p) dimensional dirichlet space, vdp.

performing the gaussian integrations over zero modes in the neumann directions

gives the normalization of the measure for nonconstant modes:

p

y=0z [dx

]e

1
4 |x |2

= [(42)1z d2qg](p+1)/2

,

(5)

with the analogous integration in the dirichlet directions normalized to unity [11].
we can expand the innitesimal nonconstant variations, x m , in a complete set of
harmonic functions satisfying the appropriate boundary condition on the ci. then
the gaussian integrations over coordinate embeddings can be straightforwardly per-
formed with the result:

vd+1(42)(p+1)/2epi6=j ti j (z d2qg)(p+1)/2(det0)(dp)/2(ndet0)(p+1)/2

(6)
where det and ndet denote the functional determinants evaluated, respectively, with
dirichlet and neumann boundary condition on the ci. on the cylinder these func-
tional determinants are identical.

,

the integration over worldsheet metrics is treated as in polchinskis evaluation of
the measure for the oneloop path integral on the torus [11], except that we specialize
to a ducial metric with constant curvature. the number of moduli, nm, and confor-
mal killing vectors, nc, are as given by the riemannroch theorem: 3=ncnm. a
specic choice of basis for quadratic dierentials on the riemann surface corresponds
to a specic parameterization, [i], of conformally inequivalent metrics g(; i). the
real parameters i, i = 1,   nm, are the moduli of the riemann surface, b of which
can be related to the lengths, li, i = 1,   , b of the boundaries as measured by the
ducial boundary metric, g(; i)|ci = ei(; li). the remaining 2(b  3) moduli
have a simple interpretation in terms of lengths and angles parameterizing the shape
of internal geodesics on the constant curvature surface. the nonorientable surface,
m(b,c), can be obtained from the orientable surface, m(b+c,0), with b + c boundaries,
by plugging c holes with crosscaps. the counting of moduli is straightforward in
this gluing. since the boundary of the crosscap is identied with the boundary of
the hole upto a relative twist, we lose the free length parameter for the geodesic
boundary of the hole, gaining an angle from the relative twist of crosscap to hole.
thus, for surfaces of negative euler character with both boundaries and crosscaps,
nm=b + c+2(b + c  3). making the appropriate extensions to the analysis of [11] we
obtain the result:

z

[dg]

v ol[di  weyl]  (2)(ncnm)/2

nm

yi=1z di(det1)1/2(z d2qg)nm/2

(detqab)1/2[det((k)ef (l)ef )]1/2

.

(7)

the notation for the various factors in the jacobian is as follows. 1 is the lapla-
cian acting on vector elds on the riemann surface, related to the scalar lapla-
cian by the identity: (1)d
c 0dc+cd. (detqab)1/2 is the contribution
to the jacobian from the constant modes of the vector laplacian. the matrices,
i, i=1,   , nm are determined by the moduli dependence of the ducial metric,
(i)ab=gab,i 1
2 gabgcdgcd,i. thus, given an explicit form for the constant curvature met-
ric with dependence on nm real moduli parameters manifest, the measure for the path

c=d

integral is completely determined. in the critical spacetime dimension, the integra-
tion over the volume of the group of reparameterizations continuously connected to
the identity, di0weyl, can be straightforwardly performed leaving the result on
the l.h.s. of eq.(8). for surfaces with (b + c)3, the contribution from the conformal
killing vectors is to be dropped from this expression since nc=0.

thus, the expression for the gauge xed path integral takes the form:

a = z [d ]epi6=j ti j (det1)1/2(det0)(dp)/2(ndet0)(p+1)/2

,

(8)

where the normalized measure for moduli, [d ], is given by:

[d ] = vd+1(2)(ncnm)/2(42)(p+1)/2

(detqab)1/2[det((k)ef (l)ef )]1/2

di(z d2qg)(nm+(p+1))/2

nm

yi=1

.

(9)

to proceed further, we need an explicit parameterization of the riemann surface
following global uniformization to some region in the complex plane. an explicit
parameterization of this region, and the formulation of the eigenfunction problem, is a
challenging problem for riemann surfaces with b+c  3 boundaries and/or crosscaps.
we reserve that discussion for future work [8]. the disk is a special case all by itself
because it uniformizes to the unit circle with positive constant curvature metric; it
also has three conformal killing vectors. surfaces with cylindrical topology are of
course easiest in this respect since they can be conformally mapped to a rectangle in
the at complex plane, and the eigenfunction problems with either choice of boundary
condition have an explicit solution. the cylinder also has a conformal killing vector
so it is helpful to treat it separately, as we do now. we will recover both the annulus
diagram of open string theory with neumann boundaries and the exchange amplitude
between a pair of static dbranes [2].

an arbitrary cylinder can be uniformized to a rectangle in the complex plane with

area:

a = z d2qg = t

.

(10)

we choose a parameterization such that the rectangle is bounded by the unit intervals,
0  1  1, 0  2  1. then the moduli dependence is restricted to the at world
sheet metric:
(11)

ds2 = (d1)2 + t2(d2)2

,

and t also corresponds to the length of the cylinder. the complete set of eigen-
functions of the scalar laplacian on this domain are simply the circular functions of
two variables, (1, 2). the length of the cylinder, t, is an eulerlagrange parameter
appearing in the eective action. note that, for the special case of the cylinder, renor-
malizations of the bulk and boundary cosmological constants are not independent.

5

the cylinder has a single conformal killing vector, 0, which contributes to the path
integral a 1 1 matrix with determinant, (2/detqab)1/2=(2/t)1/2. the measure for
moduli can be computed from the matrix, ()ab=gab,t  1
2 gabgcdgcd,t. it takes diagonal
form on the cylinder, 11 = 1/t, 22 = t, and has determinant, (det abab)1/2=1/t.
by a reparameterization of the worldsheet, the unit normal and unit tangent
vectors at both boundary circles, c1, c2, can be chosen to lie along the (2, 1)
grid. the neumann determinant is composed from the basis of periodic functions
nonvanishing on the boundary, 2=0, 1:

(n1,n2)(1, 2) = e2n1i1
(1)

cos(n22)

,

(12)

with n1, and n2 > 0. the dirichlet determinant is composed from the
orthogonal basis of periodic functions vanishing on the boundary:

(n1,n2)(1, 2) = e2n1i1
(2)

sin(n22)

,

(13)

once again, with n1, and n2 > 0. either choice of basis satises a complete-
ness relation on the cylinder.

substituting nc=nm=1 in eq.(10) for the measure, [d ], we recover the familiar

result:

z [d ] = z dt

t

vd+1(42)(p+1)/2t(p+1)/2

,

(14)

and the gauge xed path integral takes the form:

a(y) = z dt

t

vd+1(42)(p+1)/2t(p+1)/2e

1

4 y2/t[det0]12

,

(15)

where we have substituted d  1=24 for the critical string, and the relation between
vector and scalar laplacians, (det1)1/2=det0, which holds on the cylinder. the
classical contribution to the action is from open strings stretched between the branes.

the functional determinants on the cylinder can be evaluated directly following
the analysis in the appendix of ref.[11]. the eigenmodes of the scalar laplacian
with zero dirichlet boundary condition, (1)|2=0,1 = 0, are composed from the
basis functions in eq.(14), and the unregulated determinant is therefore the innite
product:

det0 = yn1,n2" 42
t2 (n2

1t2 +

n2
2
4

)#

,

(16)

with the restrictions,   n1  , n2 > 0. equivalently, we could compute the
product over eigenmodes of the vector laplacian with zero dirichlet condition, i.e.,
the variations a(1)|2=0,1 = 0. this gives the unrestricted product, n1,
n2, with the n1 = n2 = 0 term subtracted out. the required scalar deter-
minant is obtained by taking its square root [11][12]. the result for the determinant

6

of the scalar laplacian with dirichlet condition on the cylinder is [12]:

(det0)1/2 = (2t)

1

2 e2t/12 
yn=1

(1  e4nt) = (2t)

1
2 (2it) = (i/2t)

.

(17)

where we have used a modular transformation in the variable t to obtain the second
equality. from eqs.(13) we have an identical answer for the neumann determinant.
substituting in eq.(16), the static amplitude between parallel dpbranes is given by
the expression:

a(y) = z 

0

dt
t

vd+1(42)(p+1)/2t(p+1)/2e

1
4 y2/t[(i/2t)]24

.

(18)

a change of variables, s=1/2t, in the integral gives the equivalent form:

a(y) = z 

0

ds
s

vd+1(82s)(p+1)/2e

1
2 y2s[(is)]24

.

(19)

which can be compared with the expression for the exchange amplitude between static
bosonic dpbranes obtained in the operator formalism [2]. the variable s corresponds
to the length of the boundary. setting p=d we recover the cylinder amplitude of open
string theory with neumann boundaries, in a single chanpaton state, as originally
obtained in [13]. this is also consistent with the result from the method of images
[14], which can be used to relate the cylinder and torus amplitudes.

we now return to the puzzle mentioned in the introduction the emergence of non-
abelian structure in the world-sheet picture, in the limit of near-coincident dbranes.
a simple nonabelian conguration with an interesting low energy description is that
of a single probe-dbrane, spatially distant from a pair of near-coincident dbranes.
it can be given a world-sheet description as follows. consider a pants surface: an
orientable riemann surface with boundaries on three dbranes, with boundaries c2,
c3 on near-coincident dbranes. the low-energy eective theory on the branevolume
is a [su(2)u(1)]u(1) nonabelian gauge theory.

a generic pants surface can be mapped to a simply connected domain as follows.
pick a base point on the surface, z0, and cut along paths joining z0 to the three
boundaries. the resulting surface can be mapped to a 9-sided polygon, a simply
connected domain in the complex plane. for a constant curvature pants surface, with
r=1, this gives a polygon in the upper half plane with hyperbolic metric [7], and the
joining paths can be chosen as geodesics on the surface. going around the polygon
once, we can label the edges:

(r1, s1, s2, r2, s2, s3, r3, s3, s1)

,

(20)

where the ri are the images of the ci upon mapping to the complex plane. the images
of the base point lie at the intersections of adjacent pairs of joining curves, (si,si+1),

7

i=1,   , 3, taken in cyclic order. notice that the location of the base point within the
surface is arbitrary, but the limit of the mapping when the base point approaches any
boundary is singular: the domain contains a cusp on its boundary, and the ordinary
properties of function theory on the domain have to be suitably modied to take into
account the cusp.

what is the shape of the worldsheets that contribute to the singular limit of
this mapping? consider the case that z0 lies on boundary c3, and the pair, (s3,s3),
is shrunk to zero length. now the boundary lengths, li, correspond to open string
proper times. recall that the inverse length, l[12]=1/l, of a cylinder can be interpreted,
through open-closed string world-sheet duality, as the proper time of a propagating
closed string exchanged between a pair of dbranes [2]. a singular pants surface can
be given a surprisingly simple interpretation in the language of closed string proper
times. the singular worldsheet can be visualized as a closed string emitted by
dbrane d1, which propagates smoothly towards dbrane d2. in addition, d3 emits
a closed string which propagates for a vanishingly short proper time, l[23], before
being absorbed by dbrane d2. consider the limit when boundary c2 approaches
boundary c3, as with near-coincident branes. such a pants surface can be mapped to
the complex plane by cutting along only two joining curves, with the base point z0 on
the boundary c3. the apparent mismatch in the counting of moduli is accounted for
by the presence of the cusp, in agreement with the gauss-bonnet and riemann-roch
theorems.

function theory on the resulting domain has to be modied by extending the
analysis of the eigenfunction problem to domains with a cusp, a particular instance
of a domain with an isolated singular point [15]. we will reserve that discussion for
future work [8].
