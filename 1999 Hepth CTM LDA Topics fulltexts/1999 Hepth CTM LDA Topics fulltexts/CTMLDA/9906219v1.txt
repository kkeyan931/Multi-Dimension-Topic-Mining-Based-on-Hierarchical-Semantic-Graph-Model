abstract

the vacuum expectation values of the so-called q-operators of certain integrable
quantum eld theories have recently been identied with spectral determinants of
particular schrodinger operators. in this paper we extend the correspondence to
the t-operators, nding that their vacuum expectation values also have an inter-
pretation as spectral determinants. as byproducts we give a simple proof of an
earlier conjecture of ours, proved by another route by suzuki, and generalise a
problem in pt symmetric quantum mechanics studied by bender and boettcher.
we also stress that the mapping between q-operators and schrodinger equations
means that certain problems in integrable quantum eld theory are related to the
study of regge poles in non-relativistic potential scattering.

1 introduction and review

an unexpectedly precise connection between certain two-dimensional quantum eld
theories and the quantum mechanics of anharmonic oscillators was uncovered in [1]. the
quantum-mechanical side of this correspondence concerned the schrodinger problem

h(x) =(cid:18)

d2

dx2 + |x|2m(cid:19) (x) = e(x)

(1.1)

on the real line x  (,) , and the associated spectral determinant dm (), dened
for m > 1 as

dm (e) = dm (0)

(1.2)

yk=0(cid:18)1 

e

ek(cid:19) ,

with the product running over the set {ek} of eigenvalues of h. the normalisation
dm (0) = sin(/(2m +2))1 is automatic if dm is dened as a zeta-regularized func-
tional determinant (see [2]), and is also the natural choice for current purposes. however
we have chosen to negate e as compared to the conventions of [1,2], so that the zeroes of
dm (e) as dened here coincide with the eigenvalues of h rather than their negatives.
the rst result of [1] was a mapping between the functional relation satised by
d2(e), discovered in [3], and another set of functional relations, known as a y-system,
which had previously arisen in the study of perturbed conformal eld theories [4]. one
consequence was a novel expression for d2(e) as the solution of a certain non-linear
integral equation, a result that was xed uniquely by the functional relations and known
analyticity properties on the two sides of the correspondence. the move to higher integer
values of m brings a considerable increase in the complexity of the functional relations.
in [1] the spectral problems for m > 2 were related to certain further sets of functional
relations, associated with the y-systems, called t-systems, but this result rested on a
combination of analytical and numerical evidence without being proved. this gap was
lled by suzuki in [5]; an alternative proof will be given below.

the other strand in [1] was a relation between the even and odd spectral subde-
terminants for the problem (1.1) and the vacuum expectation values of objects known
as q-operators [6, 7], taken at certain values of the virasoro parameter p. the sub-
determinants are dened via a split of the eigenvalues according to the parity of their
eigenfunctions, as

dm (e) = dm (0) yk even

odd (cid:18)1 

e

ek(cid:19)

(1.3)

(so that dm (e) = d+
m (e)dm (e) ), while q-operators q+ and q were introduced,
in the form that we shall need, in [7]. they are continuum analogues of the q-matrices
of baxter [6]. to state the result of [1] more precisely, we recall that in the construction
of [7], the operators q act on virasoro modules labeled by p, with central charge
c = 1 6(1)2,  being a further parameter. in each module the vacuum (highest

1

weight) state |pi has conformal dimension (p/)2 + (c1)/24, and is an eigenstate of
the q-operators. setting

a(, p) = 2p/2

hp|q()|pi ,

(1.4)

the eigenvalues a(, p) are entire functions of the square of the spectral parameter ,
and we have

where m = 21,  = ( 1
are rederived below.

a(, 2/4) = dm (2/2)
2 2)12

(1.5)
(12)1, and the proportionality constants 
in contrast to the rst result, m does not have to be an integer for this to hold, and
so the modulus signs in (1.1) are in general obligatory when the problem is posed on the
full real line. however (as exploited in [8] for m half-integral) we can alternatively set
up the problem on the half-line (0,) with the potential x2m , so long as the boundary
condition at x = 0 is chosen correctly. the even wavefunctions are picked out by the
neumann condition 2k(0) = 0, and the odd by the dirichlet condition 2k+1(0) = 0.
these two spectral problems thus yield the even and odd spectral subdeterminants for
the whole-line problem directly.

l(l+1)

(1.6)

(cid:18)

the problem of nding spectral determinants related to the q-operators at general
values of p was addressed in [9], where it was found that the problem (1.1) should be
modied to

d2
dx2 + x2m +
on the half-line (0,).
imposing the two possible power-like behaviours at x = 0,
namely (x)  xl+1 and (x)  xl, results in two dierent spectral problems, and
their spectral determinants are proportional to the functions a+(, (2l+1)2/4) and
a(, (2l+1)2/4) respectively.

x2 (cid:19) (x) = e(x)

much of this work rested on the so-called quantum wronskian relation satised by
the operators q+ and q [7]. but a key feature of [6,7] was another functional equation,
relating the q-operators to further operators t(), sometimes called quantum transfer
matrices. called the t-q relation, it is

t()q() = q(q1) + q(q) ,

(1.7)

where

(1.8)
the vacua |pi are also eigenstates of the t(), and if we set t (, p) = hp|t()|pi then
the t-q relation for these vacuum eigenvalues can be written as

.

q = ei2

t (, p)a(, p) = e2ipa(q1, p) + e2ipa(q, p) ,

(1.9)

an equation that was also obtained in [10].

2

in this paper we point out that this relation also has a natural interpretation in the
context of the schrodinger equation, thus nding a role for the t operators at general
 and p in the schrodinger picture. this leads to an alternative derivation of the
results of [1, 9], and a novel interpretation of the fusion relations and their truncations.
it also has the bonus, for integer values of m , of providing a simple proof of the t-
system conjecture alluded to above. all of this material is contained in 26, while
7 applies the results to a problem in quantum mechanics, and 8 discusses duality
properties. finally, 9 contains our conclusions, and an appendix details the calculation
of a certain asymptotic used in 2.

2 the general t-q relation

the results of [11] provide a convenient framework for our discussion, and we begin with
a quick summary of some of this material.

consider the dierential equation

(cid:18)

d2

dx2 + p (x)(cid:19) (x) = 0

(2.1)

for general complex values of x. for our purposes we must set p (x) = x2m  e +
l(l+1)x2.
in [11] p (x) was taken to be a polynomial in x, restricting 2m to be a
positive integer, and l(l+1) to be zero. allowing 2m to be a general real number larger
than 2, or l(l+1) to be nonzero, should not change the result quoted below in any
essential way, though it will usually introduce a branch point in (x) at x = 0. modulo
this proviso, we have [11]:
 the equation (2.1) has a solution y = y(x, e, l) such that
(i) y is an entire function of (x, e) (though, for the reason just mentioned, x must in
general be considered to live on a suitable cover of the punctured complex plane).
(ii) y and y = dy/dx admit the asymptotic representations
m +1 xm +1)
m +1 xm +1)

y  xm/2 exp( 1
y  xm/2 exp( 1

(2.2)

(2.3)

as x tends to innity in any closed sector contained in the sector

| arg x| <

3

2m + 2

.

(2.4)

furthermore, the solution y is uniquely characterised by this information. (note though
that the asymptotic (2.2) is only valid as given if m > 1. extra terms appear for
m  1, consistent with the wkb result that the solution which decays as x  + is

asymptotically proportional to p (x)1/4 exp(r x p (t)1/2dt) .)

let sk denote the sector



2m +2

.

(2.5)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)arg x 

3

2k

2m +2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) <

from (2.2) it follows that y tends to zero as x tends to innity in s0, and to innity
as x tends to innity in s1 and s1. more technically, one says that y is subdominant
in s0, and dominant in s1. to nd solutions subdominant in other sectors, consider
y(x) = y(ax, e, l) for any constant a. this function solves the equation

(cid:18)

d2
dx2 + a2m +2x2m  a2e +

l(l+1)

x2 (cid:19) y(x) = 0 .

(2.6)

thus if a2m +2 = 1, y(ax, a2e, l) is another solution to the original problem (2.1).
setting  = exp(i/(m +1)) we therefore have a set of solutions

yk  yk(x, e, l) = k/2y(kx, 2ke, l) ,

(2.7)

with yk subdominant in sk and dominant in sk1. (our convention diers from [11] by
the factor of k/2, which is included for later convenience.)
a consequence of these facts is that each pair {yk, yk+1} provides a set of linearly
independent solutions to the second-order equation (2.1), and any other solution can be
expanded in terms of them. in particular,

yk1(x, e, l) = ck(e, l)yk(x, e, l) + ck(e, l)yk+1(x, e, l) .

(2.8)

the functions ck and ck are called the stokes multipliers for yk1 with respect to yk and
yk+1. it follows from (2.7) that ck(e, l) = ck1(2e, l) and ck(e, l) = ck1(2e, l).
for brevity we will write c0 and c0 as c and c respectively. (again, we dier slightly
from the conventions of [11], where the abbreviations c and c were instead reserved
for c1 and c1.)

the stokes multipliers can be expressed in terms of wronskians. recall that the

wronskian w [f, g] of two functions f (x) and g(x) is dened as

w [f, g] = f g  fg .

(2.9)

if f and g both solve a schrodinger equation such as (2.1), then w [f, g] is independent
of x; furthermore, it vanishes if and only if f and g are linearly dependent. taking the
wronskian of (2.8) at k = 0 with y1 and y0 shows that

c =

w1,1
w0,1

,

c = 

w1,0
w0,1

,

(2.10)

where we used the abbreviation wk1,k2 for w [yk1, yk2]. these wronskians are entire
functions of e and l. since y0 and y1 are independent, w0,1 never vanishes, and c and
c are also entire.

in fact, all of the ck are identically equal to 1 [11]. this follows from (2.10) and
the relations wk1+1,k2+1(e, l) = wk1,k2(2e, l) and w0,1(e, l) = 2i. (the second of
these is found by evaluating w0,1 as x tends to innity in the sectors s0 or s1, where
the asymptotic behaviours of y0 and y1 and their derivatives are determined by (2.2)

4

and (2.3).) since y1(x, e, l) = y1(x, e, l), it also follows from (2.10) that c(e, l)
is real whenever e and l are real.

the basic stokes relation (2.8) at k = 0 is therefore

with

c(e, l)y0(x, e, l) = y1(x, e, l) + y1(x, e, l)

c(e, l) =

1
2i

w1,1(e, l) .

(2.11)

(2.12)

if (2.11) is rewritten in terms of y it becomes

c(e, l)y(x, e, l) = 1/2y(x, 2e, l) + 1/2y(1x, 2e, l)

(2.13)

with x formally set to zero, this has exactly the form of (1.9) for a+(, p), albeit at the
specic value 2/4 of p for which e2ip = 1/2. (it also matches the t-q relation for a
at p = 2/4, but since a(, p) = a+(,p) [7] this is not an independent result.)
however this tactic only works when l(l+1) = 0. otherwise, the resulting equation in
e is either trivial or meaningless: if l(l+1) < 0, that is 1 < l < 0, then y(x=0, e, l) is
identically zero, while if l(l+1) > 0 then y(x=0, e, l) is almost everywhere innite.
the problem arises because any solution to (2.1) is a linear combination of one
solution, +, behaving near x = 0 as xl+1, and one, , behaving there as xl. both
of these are zero at x = 0 if l(l+1) < 0, whilst one or other is innite if l(l+1) > 0.
however, rather than considering the functions y(x, e, l) at x=0 directly, we can take
a hint from the result of [9] and project onto either + or . we choose to x + by
the x  0 asymptotic

(2.14)
since , the other solution, behaves as xl, this only determines + uniquely if e l >
3/2. if necessary, + can be dened outside this domain by analytic continuation.
in particular, since l only appears in (2.1) in the combination l(l+1) , we can continue
from l to 1l and dene  as

+(x, e, l)  xl+1 + o(xl+3) .

(x, e, l)  +(x, e,1l) .

(2.15)

this procedure does bring some subtleties, to which we shall return 5 below, but they do
not aect the arguments of this section. in discussions of the radial schrodinger equation
(see, for example, chapter 2 of [12] or chapter 4 of [13] ) +(x, e, l) for e l > 1/2 is
sometimes called the regular solution.

in analogy to (2.7), we dene shifted solutions k :

k  k (x, e, l) = k/2(kx, 2ke, l) .

(2.16)

these also solve the original problem (2.1). by considering the x  0 limit it is easily
seen that
(2.17)

k (x, e, l) = k(l+1/2)(x, e, l) .

5

we also have w [yk1+1, k2+1](e, l) = w [yk1

, k2

](2e, l) , so

w [yk, ](e, l) = k(l+1/2) w [yk, k ](e, l)

= k(l+1/2) w [y, ](2ke, l) .

(2.18)

we can now take the wronskian of both sides of (2.11) with . dening

d(e, l)  w [y(x, e, l), (x, e, l)]
and using equation (2.18), the stokes relation (2.11) becomes

(2.19)

c(e, l)d(e, l) = (1/2+l)d(2e, l) + (1/2+l)d(2e, l)

(2.20)

and (1.9) has indeed been matched, provided  is equal q (that is, ei/(m +1) = ei2
),
and l+1/2 is equal to e2ip. these are the same relations between m and , and l and
p, as obtained in [1, 9], found here by an alternative route.

to establish the precise relation between the functions appearing in equations (1.9)
and (2.20), we can use the fact that, when combined with certain analyticity proper-
ties, t-q relations of this kind are extremely restrictive [6, 7, 14]. since d+(e, l) =
d(e,l1), we need only consider d(e, l). in addition to (2.20), we have

(i) c and d are entire functions of e ;
(ii) if l is real and larger than 1/2, then the zeroes of d all lie on the positive real

axis of the complex-e plane;

(iii) if 1m/2 < l < m/2, then the zeroes of c all lie away from the positive real

axis of the complex-e plane;

(iv) if m > 1 then d has the large-e asymptotic

log d(e, l)

(2.22)

(2.23)

property (i) follows from the denition (2.19) of d as a wronskian, given that the
functions involved are themselves entire functions of e. property (ii) is also straightfor-
ward, since a zero of d(e, l) signals the existence of an eigenfunction for (1.6) at that
value of e, decaying as xl+1 as x  0, and exponentially as x  +. the self-adjoint

6

nature of this problem for l > 1/2 then ensures the reality of these zeroes. for l > 0,
the potential is everywhere positive and multiplying (1.6) by (x) and integrating from
0 to  shows that all of the eigenvalues e must also all be positive. for 1/2 < l < 0
the centrifugal term in the potential, l(l+1)/x2, is negative but the same style of argu-
ment can be applied to the transformed equation (a.3), with the conclusion that the
eigenvalues are again all positive. property (iii) is more delicate, and further discussion
will be postponed until 3, where a partial result will be established. finally, property
(iv) follows from a wkb analysis, which is outlined in appendix a, and property (v)
from a mapping of the problem at e = 0 into an exactly-solvable case, given in 3
below.
we now claim that for m > 1 and 1/2 < l < m/2 , the t-q relation (2.20) and
properties (i)(v) characterise the functions c(e, l) and d(e, l) uniquely. further-
more, with the identications

2 =

m +1

,

p =

2l+1
4m +4

(2.24)

the same t-q relation and the same properties (i)(v) hold for the functions t (, p)
and a+(, p) of [7], save for 2 replacing e in (i), the asymptotic in (iv) becoming

log a+(, p)  (m +1)( 1

| arg(2)| <  , (2.25)
and a+(0, p) being equal to one rather than the value given in (v). the asymptotics
can be made to agree by setting

|2|   ,

 = e1/2 ,

 = (2m +2)1/2( 1

2 )1

(2.26)

while (v) is xed by multiplying a+(, p) by d(0, l). by the claimed uniqueness, we
therefore have

(2.27)

where  = d(0, 2p/21/2)1, and

(2.28)

continuation from l to l1 and the identity a(, p) = a+(,p) were used to deduce
the relation between a and d+ in (2.27), while the result (2.12) was used to express
c(e, l) in terms of w1,1(e, l) in (2.28). as will seen in the next section, the expression
in terms of the wronskian appears to be the most general.

it remains to discuss the uniqueness property. observe rst that the asymptotic
(2.21) applies as |e|   along any ray with arg e 6= 0, since the wkb problem only
has turning-points if e is on the positive real axis. since the growth of log d(e, l)

7

in this remaining direction is no greater we conclude that the order of d(e, l) as a
function of e is equal to (m +1)/2m . (the order of an entire function f (z), if nite, is
the lower bound of all positive numbers a such that |f (z)| = o(era
) as |z| = r  .
see, for example, chapter 8 of [15].) for m > 1, (m +1)/2m is less than 1, and
hadamards factorization theorem implies that d can be written as an innite product
over its set of zeroes {en} of the following form:

d(e, l) = d(0, l)

(2.29)

yn=0(cid:18)1 

e

en(cid:19) .

as an aside, we note that this is the nal ingredient needed to prove that d, and
hence a+, is proportional to a spectral determinant: from the discussion of property
(ii) above, the zeroes of d coincide with those of the relevant spectral determinant,
and the residual ambiguity of an entire function with no zeroes is reduced to an overall
constant by (2.29). (in fact, the normalisation of d given by (2.23) coincides with an
earlier natural normalisation for the spectral determinant when m is an integer and l
is equal to 0 or 1 [8], so it is reasonable to say that d is actually equal to the spectral
determinant.)

if m  1 the order is larger, permitting a more complicated prefactor to the product
in (2.29), and furthermore the asymptotic density of zeroes necessitates modications
to the terms in the product to ensure their convergence (again, see [15]). for the most
part we have been excluding such cases from our discussion, but we remark that there is
evidence that many of our results continue to hold even after the region m > 1 (called
the semiclassical domain in [7]) is left. some of this evidence was given in [1]; some
more can be found in the next section, and in 7.
reverting to m > 1, the product representation (2.29) allows the steps described
in [7,16] to be repeated to show that d is determined by a nonlinear integral equation
of the type introduced in [14, 16]. introduce the function
d(e, l) = 2l+1 d(2e, l)
d(2e, l)

(2.30)

.

from (2.20) and property (i), the points at which d = 1 are exactly the zeroes of c
and d. by properties (ii) and (iii), those on the positive real axis are the zeroes of
d, those on the negative real axis the zeroes of c. (the need for property (iii) was
not mentioned in [7], but if it fails equation (2.32) below has to be modied, becoming
the massless version of one of the equations obtained in [17].) the large-e behaviour
of d(e, l) follows from (2.21):

m +1 < arg(e) < 2

(2.31)

m +1

this asymptotic is only correct for m > 1. the situation for m < 1 is discussed in appendix a

log d(e, l) 

8

where b0 = 2 cos( 
2m )a0. (by (e) we imply ei arg(e)|e|. thus the rst and third
asymptotics coincide, as indeed they must since d is a single-valued function of e. in
the language of [16], they correspond to the second determination.)

now trade e for the new variable  =  log(2e). then the arguments of [7] can

be followed to show that the function f (, l) = log d(2e/, l) solves

as mentioned above, such nonlinear integral equations rst arose in [14, 16]. we must
now assume that the solution to this equation is unique. in this (massless) context such
an assumption seems reasonable, though we did not attempt a complete proof. (note
though that for the closely-related tba integral equations, such a uniqueness result can
fail at nonzero complex values of the mass scale, as can be seen from gure 1 of [18].)
a knowledge of f xes d up to an overall constant, given the general information on
the locations of the zeroes of d and c contained in properties (i) and (ii) above. in
turn, this constant is determined by property (v), and so d and hence c have been
determined. while a more direct approach to the main uniqueness claim would perhaps
be more satisfactory, the fact, already stressed in [1], that spectral problems can be
solved with the aid of a nonlinear integral equation is of independent interest, and will
be put to use in 7 below.

3 the harmonic oscillator and the free-fermion point

the case m = 1 falls just outside the semiclassical domain m > 1, 2 < 1/2 that
we have been discussing. however, it corresponds to the three-dimensional harmonic
oscillator, for which the exact wave-functions are known. as explained in, for example,
[19], the general solution to the radial schrodinger equation for the harmonic oscillator at
angular momentum l can be written in terms of the conuent hypergeometric functions
m (a, b, z) and u (a, b, z) (the notation is as in [20]). the correctly-normalised solution,
subdominant in the sector s0, turns out to be

(notice the extra factor of xe/2 here compared to the earlier formula (2.2), reecting
the fact that the semiclassical domain has been left.) taking from [20] the analytic

the function 1

2i w1,1(e, l) can be calculated explicitly. the result is

at m =1 we have  = 1/4, e = 42, and l = 4p1/2, and so from (2.28) we nd

this agrees with the result obtained by the authors of [7] for the vacuum expectation
value of the operator t at 2 = 1/2, the so-called free-fermion point, for the particular
value 0 of their non-universal renormalisation constant c.
one subtlety has been glossed over here. the modied asymptotic (3.2) changes the
value of w0,1(e, l) from 2i to 2i eie/4, so that c(e, l) is no longer equal to 1, but
rather eie/2. hence (2.11) becomes

c(e, l)y0(x, e, l) = y1(x, e, l) + eie/2y1(x, e, l)

(3.7)

and the would-be t-q relation (2.20) must be replaced by

eie/4c(e, l)d(e, l) = i(l+1/2)+e/2d(2e, l) + i(l+1/2)e/2d(2e, l)

(3.8)
with  = ei/2. this precisely matches the renormalised t-q relation obtained in [7]
for the free-fermion point, so long as t (, p) is identied with eie/4 c(e, l) at this
point rather than c(e, l). but when this t is reexpressed in terms of wronskians, the
new prefactor is exactly cancelled by the modication to w0,1(e, l), with the result
that the general relation (2.28) between t and w1,1 survives unscathed. considering
the asymptotics discussed in appendix a, we expect similar modications to the t-q
relation to occur at m = 1/(2m1) , 2 = 1  1/2m , for any positive integer m.
now we can return to property (iii) from the last section, which states that for
l  (1m/2, m/2), there are no zeroes of c on the positive-real e axis. we will only
discuss m  1. then a wkb analysis as in [21] can be used to show that at large
|e| all zeroes must lie near the negative-real axis, and hence satisfy property (iii). (in
fact, it seems clear that for m  1 they lie on the negative axis, but this is harder to

10

prove.) there remains the possibility that some zeroes at smaller values of |e| lie on
the positive-real axis, and to exclude this at least for m near 1 we use the fact that the
zero positions at m =1 are determined by (3.5), and are

e = 4n  2  (2l + 1) ,

n = 1, 2, . . .

(3.9)

thus for m =1 and 3/2 < l < 1/2 the zeroes are bounded away from the positive-real
axis. by uniform continuity in compact domains, this will also to be true for the low-
lying zeroes if m is suciently close to 1. (note that continuity alone does not exclude
the possibility of a zero at large |e| violating (iii) for m arbitrarily near to 1, which
is why we also had to invoke the wkb argument.) in fact, it appears that all of the
zeroes of c actually lie on the negative-real axis for m  1 and l  (1m/2, m/2).
at l = 0, this is the main conjecture of [21]; some numerical evidence for the claim at
other values of l is given in 7. however, the given range for l is certainly maximal:
from the formula

c(0, l) = 2 cos

 ,

(3.10)

2l+1
2m +2

a consequence of the t-q relation (2.20), it follows that c(e, l) has a zero at e=0 when
l = 1m/2 and l = m/2.
finally in this section we calculate d(0, l)|m . at m =1 , (3.1) can be used with
the relation u (a, 2a, x2) = 1 x12aex2/2ka1/2(x2/2) , where ka is a bessel function of
second kind, to see that

y(x, 0, l)|m =1=

1


x1/2kl/2+1/4(x2/2) .

(3.11)

for  > 0 and z  0, k(z)  1

2 () (z/2) [20] , so for l > 1/2 we have

y(x, 0, l)|m =1 

1


2l1/2 ( l

2 + 1

4 ) xl

as x  0 ,

(3.12)

and hence, using (a.1), d(0, l)|m =1 = 1 2l+3/2 (1+ l
the general-m case can be recovered by using the fact that at e=0 a variable change
relates a solution at arbitrary m and l to a solution at m =1, but with l replaced by
l = l(l, m ). considering that the normalisation at large x must be in agreement with
(2.2), the relevant transformation is

2 + 1

4 ) .

y(x, 0, l)|m = (

2

m +1 )1/4x(m +1)/4y((

2

m +1 )1/2x(m +1)/2, 0, 2l+1

m +1  1

2 )|m =1

(3.13)

and repeating the steps already described for m =1, the result quoted in the last section
is recovered:

d(0, l)|m = ()1 = 1 (1 + 2l+1

2m +2 ) (2m +2)

to nd d+(0, l), we continue from l to 1l :

11

2l+1

2m +2 + 1

2 .

(3.14)

d+(0, l)|m = (+)1 = 1 (1  2l+1

2m +2 ) (2m +2) 2l+1

2m +2 + 1

2 .

notice that

d(0, l)|m d+(0, l)|m = (+)1 = (2l+1)/sin 2l+1

2m +2  .

(3.15)

(3.16)

when l=0, d and d+ correspond to half-line problems with dirichlet and neumann
boundary conditions at the origin respectively, and therefore yield the odd and even
spectral determinants for the whole-line problem (1.1). (this is why the  signs were
swapped in our denitions between d and a.) their product is the full spectral
determinant, and the result (3.16) at l=0 matches the formula for dm (0) given in [22,23].

4 fusion relations and monodromy

the t-q relation is not the only functional equation which arises in the context of the
t- and q-operators (see, for example, [7,10,2427]). further relations are conveniently
expressed using the fused t-operators tj, which can be built up by a process known
as fusion from the basic operator t. introducing a half-integer valued index j = 0, 1/2,
1, . . ., the rst set of fusion relations, sometimes called a t-system, reads as follows:

tj(q1/2)tj(q1/2) = 1 + tj+1/2()tj1/2()

where t0()  1 and t1/2()  t(). the fused ts can also be obtained from

t()tj(qj+1/2) = tj1/2(qj+1) + tj+1/2(qj)

(4.1)

(4.2)

or

t()tj(qj1/2) = tj1/2(qj1) + tj+1/2(qj) .

(4.3)
the vacuum states |pi are also eigenstates of these fused t-operators. in this section we
shall show that the vacuum expectation values tj()  hp|tj()|pi arise naturally in
the context of the schrodinger equation (2.1), leading to a reinterpretation of the fusion
relations and their truncations in terms of the behaviour of solutions to this equation
under analytic continuation.

as remarked earlier, each pair of functions {ym, ym+1} provides a basis for the space
of solutions to (2.1). so far, we have only examined the expansion of yk1 in the basis
{yk, yk+1}, but it is natural to ask about other possibilities. to this end, we extend the
denition (2.8) of ck and ck by setting
yk1 = c (m)
(4.4)
k = ck = 1 ). the change from the {yk+m1, yk+m} basis
k (cid:18) yk+m1

(so that c (1)
to the {yk1, yk} basis is then eected by a 2  2 matrix c

further relations reect the fact that the change from the basis {yk+m+n1, yk+m+n}
to {yk+m1, yk+m}, followed by the change from {yk+m1, yk+m} to {yk1, yk}, has the
same eect as accomplishing the overall change in one go:

c

k c

(n)
k+m = c

(m+n)

(4.8)

(these express the consistency of the analytic continuations, and can be thought of as
monodromy relations.) consider rst the case m = 1. we have

c (n)

k+2 = c (n+1)

and

ck

in addition, we have the initial conditions

c (0)

k = 1

c (1)

k = ck

follows on comparing (4.11) with (4.10). if we now set

c (n)(e) = c (n)

(n+1e) ,

then (4.10) is equivalent to

c (n+1)
k
c (n)

k+1 (cid:19) ,

(4.9)

(4.10)

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)

; and then the more general

(4.14)

(4.15)

c(e)c (n)(n+1e) = c (n1)(n+2e) + c (n+1)(ne) ,

(4.16)

and this matches the fusion relation (4.2). since c (0)(e) = 1 = t0(e) and, from the
last section, c (1)(e) = c(e) = t1/2(e1/2), this establishes the basic equality

c (n)(e) = tn/2(e1/2) .

(4.17)

13

it is easy to check that the fusion relation (4.3) emerges in a similar manner from (4.8)
at n = 1. to recover the t-system (4.1), one more piece of information is needed.
taking wronskians in (4.4) yields

c (m)

k =

1
2i

wk1,k+m ,

c (m)
k = 

1
2i

wk1,k+m1 .

an immediate consequence is the recovery of (4.14), but we also obtain

k = c (m2)
c (m)
k+m+1 .

(4.18)

(4.19)

using this result, the n = m case of (4.8), namely c

(m)
k c

(m)
k+m = 1, implies that

c (m1)(1e)c (m1)(e)  c (m)(e)c (m2)(e) = 1 .

(4.20)

given the identication (4.21), this is the t-system (4.1), evaluated on the vacuum state
|pi. finally, the formula (4.18) allows the function tn/2 to be expressed alternatively in
terms of a wronskian:

tn/2(e1/2) = c (n)(e) =

1
2i

w1,n(n+1e) .

(4.21)

this will be relevant in 7 below.
the monodromy relations used so far have all been local, in that they can be built
up from continuations of the functions yk from one sector sn to its neighbours sn1.
but there is also the possibility to continue all the way round the origin a number of
times. if the cover of the punctured x-plane on which the yk live closes in a suitable
sense, this leads to new relations, and these turn out to correspond to the truncations
of fusion hierarchies in the integrable quantum eld theory.

as an illustration, we will discuss the simplest class of examples, which arise when
2m is an integer and l(l+1) is zero. then all solutions to (2.1), and in particular the
yk(x, e, l), are single valued on the once-punctured x-plane, and the sector sn+2m +2
coincides with the sector sn. both yn and yn+2m +2 are subdominant in this sector, and
so they must be proportional to each other. to nd the precise relationship, consider
their behaviour as |x|   in sn, setting x =  eni/(m +1) and letting   . from
(2.2) and (2.7),
yn  n/2m/2 exp( 1
and so yn+2m +2(x, e, l) = yn(x, e, l). from (4.21) we immediately deduce

m +1 m +1) , yn+2m +2  n/2m/2 exp( 1

m +1 m +1) (4.22)

c (2m )(e) = 1

,

c (2m +1)(e) = 0

and hence the relation (4.20) can be rewritten as

c (m)(1e)c (m)(e) = 1 +

2m1yn=1 (cid:16)c (n)(e)(cid:17)lnm

14

(4.23)

(4.24)

where lnm is the incidence matrix of the a2m1 dynkin diagram. this is the simplest
example of truncation, and ultimately [24] leads, via the y functions discussed briey
in 6 below, to alternative sets of integral equations of the tba type [28]. for integer
values of m , these equations were applied in [1] to the computation of the energy levels
of anharmonic oscillators with analytic potentials x2m .

at arbitrary rational values of m +1, a similar collapse of the set of solutions
{yk}k=
occurs, but this time on some nite cover of the punctured x-plane. again,
a truncation of the fusion hierarchy results. for nonzero values of l(l+1) the situation
is a little more subtle, as there is a multivaluedness in the solutions induced by the
singularity at x = 0. to handle this behaviour the alternative basis {, +} is more
appropriate. we leave further discussion of this point to future work, but we expect
that all of the more general truncations of the fusion hierarchy (4.20) will eventually
nd a geometrical interpretation in terms of the behaviours of solutions to the basic
dierential equation (2.1).

5 the (fused) quantum wronskians

the next task is to relate the fused stokes multipliers c (m) to the functions d discussed
in 2. recall that the wronskian is bilinear in the space of dierentiable functions, so
that given four arbitrary functions f (x), g(x), h(x) and l(x), and arbitrary constants
, , , , we have

w [f + g, h + l] = w [f, h] + w [f, l] + w [g, h] + w [g, l]

(5.1)
for almost all l (exceptions will be discussed below), the functions {, +} intro-
duced in (2.14) and (2.15) provide an alternative basis for the space of solutions to
in particular, using the results w [y, ] = d and
the dierential equation (2.1).
w [, +] = 2l+1, we have

.

(2l+1)y(x, e, l) = d(e, l)(x, e, l)  d+(e, l)+(x, e, l) ,
more generally, the shifted solutions dened by (2.7) and (2.16) satisfy

(5.2)

(2l+1)yk(x, e, l) = d(2ke, l)k (x, e, l)  d+(2ke, l)+

k (x, e, l) .

(5.3)

taking the wronskian (5.3) at k = 1 with the same equation at k = n, shifting e to
1ne and then using the formula (4.21) for c (n)(e), property (5.1) and the results

w [+
k , +
w [p , +

p ] = w [k , p ] = 0 ,
k ] = (2l+1)(kp)(l+1/2)

(5.4)

(valid at arbitrary shifts p and k), we nd

(4l+2)i c (n)(e) = (n+1)(l+1/2)d(n+1e, l)d+(n1e, l)

 (n+1)(l+1/2)d(n1e, l)d+(n+1e, l) .

(5.5)

15

in the context of integrable quantum eld theory, a corresponding set of relations was
given in [7]:

2i sin(2p)tj () = q(4j+2)p/2

a+(qj+1/2, p)a(qj1/2, p)

 q(4j+2)p/2

a+(qj1/2, p)a(qj+1/2, p)

(5.6)

where j = 0, 1/2, 1 . . . . with the identications (2.27) and (2.28), and using the result
(3.16), the two sets of relations agree if, as before, q =  and 2p/2 = l + 1/2. at j = 0,
(5.6) is the quantum wronskian relation of [7], while the n = 0 case of (5.5) was rst
found (for m an integer and l = 0) in [3]. the match between these two was a key
ingredient in [1, 9].

the t-system conjecture of [1], proved in [5], is a simple corollary of this result. if

l = 0 and m is an integer, then (5.5) at n = m becomes

c (m )(e) = d+(e)d(e) = dm (e) ,

(5.7)

the second equality following because at l = 0, d+ and d are the even and odd
spectral subdeterminants respectively for the full-line problem (1.1). since c (m )(e) =
tm/2(e1/2), this establishes the conjectured relation between dm and the vacuum
expectation value tm/2. (note though the small dierences in notation from [1]: as well
as the negation of e already mentioned in the introduction, a half-integer j has been
used to index the t operators in this paper, in line with the conventions of [7, 26, 27],
while in [1] the index was integer-valued. thus in [1] the correspondence was with tm
rather than tm/2.)

next we return to the fact that the pair of functions {, +} does not always
furnish a basis for the space of solutions to the dierential equation (2.1). the most
obvious counterexample to such a claim is the point l = 1/2, at which  = +.
more generally, since  is initially dened by analytic continuation in l, there may be
points at which poles are encountered. if these poles are removed by multiplying by a
regularising factor, the resulting solution  may fail to be independent of + at those
values of l where previously there had been divergences. this is related to the remark
in [7] that at certain values of p the functions a+(, p) and a(, p) may coincide. in
the context of the radial schrodinger equation, a discussion of the issue can be found
in, for example, chapter 4 of [13]. the most direct way to locate the problem values
of l is probably the iterative construction of  and + given in [29]. for the potential
x2m , for which the function u (x) of [29] is equal to x2m  e, poles +(x, e, l) occur at
l + 1/2 = m1  (m +1)m2, with m1 and m2 non-negative integers. hence {, +}
fails as a basis at the points

l + 1/2 = (m1 + (m +1)m2) ,

m1, m2  0 .

(5.8)

for integer values of 2m , this is just a standard phenomenon in the frobenius method,
which predicts that one of the pair {, +} may have a logarithmic component when-
ever the two solutions to the indicial equation (1) = l(l+1) dier by an integer, or
an even integer when 2m is even.

16

rather than giving a complete treatment, we will focus here on the l = 1/2 case.
this corresponds to the ground state of the untwisted sine-gordon model, and so is
particularly interesting from the eld-theoretic point of view. the emergence of loga-
rithmic corrections can be understood by taking an appropriate limit l  1/2. using
(5.2), valid away from the points (5.8), set l = 1/2 +  with  tending to zero. near
x = 0 we have

y(x, e, 1

2 + )  d(e, 1

2 ) x1/2 x+x

2

 d(e, 1

2 ) x1/2 xx

2

(5.9)

where the primes denote dierentiation with respect to l and we used the facts that
d(e, l) and d(e, l) are nonsingular at l = 1/2 to expand d(e,1/2+) 
d(e,1/2) d(e,1/2), expanding x = exp( log x) to rst order in , (5.9)
becomes
(5.10)
we see that y(x, e,1/2) has an x1/2 log x component at small x, as expected from the
frobenius method. the basis {, +} should therefore be replaced at l = 1/2, and
a suitable choice is the pair {, +}:

2 ) x1/2  d(e, 1

2 )  d(e, 1

y(x, e, 1

2 ) x1/2 log x .

+(x, e)  x1/2 + o(x5/2) ,
(x, e)  x1/2 log x + o(x5/2) .

the jost functions (2.19) become

d(e) = w [y(x, e, 1

2 ), (x, e)] ,

(5.11)

(5.12)

so that d(e) = d(e, 1
2 ) . it is interesting to see the
eect that these changes have on the basic functional relations. we set k (x, e) =
k/2(kx, 2ke) and use the wronskians

2 ) , and d+(e) = d(e, 1

p , +

q ] = 0 ,

w [+
w [p , q ] = (qp) log  ,
w [+

p , q ] = 1 ,

to nd, with dk  d(2ke),

w [yp, yq] = (q  p) dp

dq log  + ( dp

q  dq
d+

d+
p )

and feeding this into the formula (4.21) for c (n) yields

c (n)(e) =

d(n+1e) d(n1e)

(n+1)
2m +2

+

1

2i(cid:16) d(n1e) d+(n+1e)  d(n+1e) d+(n1e)(cid:17) .

17

(5.13)

(5.14)

(5.15)

note also, from (3.14) and (3.15), that

d(0) =r 2m + 2



,

d+(0) =

2


(2+2m )1/2(log(2+2m )  e)

(5.16)

where e  (1) = 0.57721... is the euler-mascheroni constant. finally from (2.11),
(5.10) and (5.11) we obtain

c(e) d(e) = d(2e) + d(2e)

(5.17)

c(e) d+(e) = d+(2e) + d+(2e) +(cid:16) d(2e)  d(2e)(cid:17) log  .

thus at l = 1/2 one of the two t-q relations has to be changed. similarly, comparing
(5.15) with the fused quantum wronskian (5.5) shows that the relationship between
c (n)(e) and d(e, l) undergoes a nontrivial modication. the fact that for the ground
state energy of the untwisted sine-gordon model things need to be slightly modied was
already observed, from a completely dierent angle, in [30]. there, the general solution
of the sine-gordon y -system was described in terms of a single quasi-periodic function
h(e), satisfying h(e2m +2) = p+qh(e), where p and q can, for the purposes of [30] and
the example investigated here, be taken to be constants. in order to have the correct
uv-limit for the untwisted sine-gordon model (corresponding to l = 1/2 ), a non-
vanishing p was required, leading to a log(e) component in h(e) (see (6.14) below). in
a slightly dierent language, this turns out to be what we have derived here. a match
with the results of [30] is the topic of the next section, where, as simple byproduct of
the mapping, a curious property of the spectral determinants is pointed out.

6 y-systems and dilogarithm identities

as mentioned in 4, there is a second set of functional relations, the so-called y-system,
closely related to the t-system discussed in the previous sections. the relation between
these two systems is

and the y s full the relation

yn(e) = c n+1(e)c n1(e)

yn(e)yn(1e) = (1 + yn+1(e))(1 + yn1(e))

(6.1)

(6.2)

for m integer or half-integer and l = 0, this system truncates (y0(e) = y2m (e) = 0),
and it coincides with the a2m1-related y-system discussed in [4].

on the other hand, the y -functions are related to the solutions of tba equations.
in this framework they encode nite-size eects in integrable quantum eld theories,
and, through the consideration of ultraviolet limits, lead to certain remarkable sum rules
for the rogers dilogarithm function involving the stationary (e = 0) solutions of the
system (6.2). for m integer and l = 0, for example, the relevant sum rule is

.

(6.5)

with some additional complications, sum rules similar to (6.3) can be written for any ra-
tional m [31] and arbitrary l. in [32] a generalisation of (6.3) involving the e-dependent
y -functions was proposed. for an arbitrary solution yn(e) to (6.2) (but again with m
an integer and l = 0 ) the result is

(6.6)

dilogarithms also appear in certain volume calculations in three-dimensional mani-
folds (see for example [33]), and related to this idea is the fact [34] that the general
solution to (6.2) can be expressed using cross-ratios

(a, b, c, d) =

(a  c)(b  d)
(a  d)(b  c)

.

(6.7)

surprisingly, the points involved in the cross-ratio can be expressed in terms of a single
quasi-periodic function of e : if h(e) satises

h(e2m +2)  p + qh(e)

then

solves (6.2).

yn(e) = (h(ne), h(n2e), h(ne), h(n+2e))

(6.8)

(6.9)

now we would like to show that the function h(e) is a natural object in the context
of the schrodinger equation. since c (0)(e) = 1 for all e, we can rewrite c (n+1)(e) as
c (n+1)(e)/c (0)(n+1e) and, for generic values of l, expand out numerator and denom-
inator using (5.5) to nd

c (n+1)(e) = (l+1/2)(n+1) d+(n2e, l)
d+(ne, l)

(cid:0)k(n+2e)  k(n2e)(cid:1)

(k(n+2e)  k(ne))

where

k(e) = el+1/2d(e, l)/d+(e, l) .

(6.10)

(6.11)

similarly,

c (n1)(e) = (l+1/2)(n+1) d+(ne, l)
d+(n2e, l)

(k(ne)  k(ne))
(k(ne)  k(n2e))

and so, from (6.1),

yn(e) = 

k(n+2e)  k(n2e)
k(n+2e)  k(ne)

k(ne)  k(ne)
k(ne)  k(n2e)

.

(6.12)

(6.13)

this was for generic values of l: the story changes at those points where {, +} fails
it
to be a basis. the rst example is l = 1/2, where (5.5) is replaced by (5.15).
turns out that the nal result (6.13) continues to hold, so long as the denition (6.11)
is swapped for

k(e) = log e + 2 d+(e)/ d(e) .

(6.14)

comparing (6.13) with (6.9), the function k(e) as dened in (6.11) gives a realisation
of h(e) for p = 0 and q = e2i(l+1/2), while the denition (6.14) coincides with the case
q = 1, p = 2i. note also that when l = 0, k(e) is essentially the (reciprocal of) the
alternating, or skew, spectral determinant discussed in [22,23]. it is interesting that the
result (6.6) (and its generalisations) appears to furnish a novel form of sum rule for the
spectral determinants of schrodinger equations.

(7.1)

from 4 implies that the vacuum expectation values of the t-operators also have an
interpretation as spectral determinants. the right hand side of (7.1) vanishes if and
only if e is such that the functions y1 and yn are linearly dependent, which in turn is
true if and only if there is a nontrivial solution to (2.1) which decays to zero as x tends to
innity in the sectors s1 and sn. this is an eigenvalue problem, and the argument just
given shows that the zeroes of c (n) coincide with the zeroes of its spectral determinant.
from (5.5) and (2.21), the order of c (n) is less than 1 for m > 1, so the discussion around
(2.29) for d applies equally to c (n), and shows that this function is actually equal to
the spectral determinant, with a normalisation which again turns out to coincide with
the natural one for 2m an integer and l equal to 0 or 1. (incidentally, for m integer
and l zero this gives us another easy proof of the t-system conjecture, obtained more
indirectly via the subdeterminants d in 5 above.) general eigenproblems of this sort,
where the boundary conditions are specied as |x|   in two sectors in the complex x
plane, are discussed in chapter 6 of [11] and also in [21, 35]. they are the other natural

20

set of spectral problems associated with (2.1), and it is pleasing that they correspond
so neatly with the fused t-operators.

as an application, we consider and generalise a problem treated by bender and
boettcher in [21]. these authors discussed the spectrum of the hamiltonian p2  (ix)n
with n real, corresponding to the eigenvalue equation

 (x)  (ix)n (x) = e(x) .

(7.2)

for quantised energy levels the boundary conditions must be chosen appropriately. the
standard requirement is for (x) to tend to zero as |x|   on the real axis, but for
arbitrary n the problem needs to be continued into the complex x-plane. the real x-axis
is replaced by some contour, and the boundary conditions are imposed at the two ends of
this contour. the regions where (x) can vanish exponentially as |x|   are wedges,
bounded by what bender and boettcher referred to as stokes lines, with the vanishing
being most rapid at the centers of the wedges, called by them anti-stokes lines. (beware
that many authors use exactly the opposite terminology  see, for example, [36].) there
are thus a variety of eigenvalue problems associated with (7.2), depending on the choice
of asymptotic directions for the contour relative to the wedges. the problem studied
in [21] was the analytic continuation of the usual harmonic oscillator, so the wedges
were picked to allow the quantisation contour to run along the real axis when n = 2.
this selects the wedges centred on the directions

left =  +

and right =

,

(7.3)

each of opening angle  = 2/(n +2). bender and boettcher studied the problem both
numerically and analytically, and found strong evidence for an entirely real spectrum
for n  2, with a transition at n = 2 below which innitely-many eigenvalues become
complex. this they associated with a spontaneous breaking of pt symmetry in the
quantum-mechanical problem.

if we set (x) = (x/i), (7.2) becomes

 (x) + xn (x) = e (x) .

(7.4)

and matches our original schrodinger equation (2.1) with m = n/2, l = 0, and e re-
placed by e. furthermore, it is easily checked that the wedges dened by (7.3) become
the sectors s1 and s1. referring back to the discussion following (7.1), this means that
the eigenvalues of the problem posed by (7.2) and (7.3) occur at the negated zeroes of
c (1)(e), and are thus encoded in the pattern of zeroes of the vacuum expectation value
of the fundamental quantum transfer matrix t()  t1/2().
in turn, these can be found via the non-linear integral equation (2.32). the results
are displayed in gure 7, and agree perfectly with the results of [21], which were obtained
by a direct treatment of the dierential equation in the complex plane. note that the
transition at n = 2 corresponds to the point at which the associated sine-gordon model
moves from the attractive to the repulsive regime, and that the match with the results

of bender and boettcher continues to hold even after this point has been passed, and
the semiclassical domain n > 2 has been left.

from the point of view of equation (2.32), the restriction to l = 0 is unnecessary.
once it is relaxed, we are led to the following generalisation of the bender-boettcher
problem:

 (x)  (ix)n (x) + l(l+1)x2 = e(x) .

(7.5)

this seemingly-innocent modication to the hamiltonian turns out to have a remark-
able eect on its spectrum. in gure 2 we show some results from an initial numerical
investigation. a few features merit immediate comment. at n = 2, the exact eigenval-
ues can always be found by negating formula (3.9). the behaviour for n < 2 depends
it
signicantly on the sign of l. the situation at l = 0.025 is shown in gure 2a.
might appear similar to that at l = 0, but the connectivity of the states on the plots is
exactly reversed: the ground state is now joined to the rst excited state, the second
to the third, and so on. as l increases, the level joined to the ground state icks up
through the rest of the spectrum, leaving a restored connectivity pattern in its wake.
the mechanism should be clear enough from gures 2b to 2d. by the time l reaches
zero the earlier situation has been recovered, with the ground state no longer connected
to one of the excited states, but rather diverging to + along the line n = 1. then for
l > 0 the ground state eigenvalue ventures for the rst time into the domain n  (0, 1].

(to make sense of the eigenvalue problem in this regime requires its consideration on a
cover of the once-punctured complex plane, with the sectors s1 and s1 overlapping on
dierent sheets.) figures 2e and 2f show this behaviour. observe from gure 2f that the
ground state eigenvalue is zero at l = 0.05, n = 0.2. more generally, (3.10) implies that
the problem has a zero eigenvalue when n = 4l. this means that the steeply-climbing
line on gure 2e should also return to zero, at n = 0.004. while our program currently
breaks down at such small values of n , plots made at intermediate values of l (between
0.001 and 0.05) oer clear support for this scenario.

the reality property observed by bender and boettcher for l = 0.

for the values of l pictured, the spectrum is entirely real for n  2, thus generalising
in a subsequent paper [35] further eigenvalue problems were discussed, based on
hamiltonians of the form p2 + x2k (ix), with the two quantisation wedges chosen so as
to be centred on the positive and negative real axes when  = 0. in these conventions,
the earlier problem corresponds to k = 1,  = n2. it is straightforwardly checked
that, just as t1/2 or c (1) encodes the spectrum of the problem for k = 1, so the functions
tk/2 or c (k) encode the spectra of the more general problems. this means that these
problems, treated separately in [35], are in fact intimately linked together, since their
spectral determinants participate in the fusion hierarchy, or t-system, discussed in 4
above. on the other hand, the numerical and analytical work in [35] immediately
gives us a rather detailed picture of the behaviour of the zeroes of the general fused t
operators. worth noting in this regard is the fact that the rst transition to complex
eigenvalues for the schrodinger problem, that is to complex zero positions for the fused
t operator, always occurs at  = 0. in the earlier notation of this paper, this point
corresponds to 2m = n = 2k, and for k > 1, it lies well inside the semiclassical
domain m > 1, 2 = 1/(m +1) < 1/2.

as this paper was being nished, a further article by bender et al appeared [37].
there a form of classical limit (2  0) is discussed. more precisely, the limit is
m   with l = 0 and e  e/m 2 held xed. (this diers from the limit treated
in appendix b of [7] where m   with l and e is held xed, and the functions a
and tj, j = o(m ), are treated. taking the limit with e/m 2 xed instead of e is
appropriate for capturing the behaviour of the functions tj with j remaining nite.)
for the initial problem, corresponding to k = 1 and the function t1/2 or c (1), bender
et al found

ek(m )  (k + 1

2 )2m 2 ,

k = 0, 1 . . . , m   .

(7.6)

(note that in [37] m is instead used to label the dierent eigenproblems, the role
played by k here.) the result (7.6) suggests that the limiting form for the spectral

determinant c (1)(e, l) at l=0 is 2 cos(e) . (the minus sign appears for the same

reason as before, namely the variable change in going from (7.2) to (7.4).) assuming
that the fusion hierarchy (4.20) holds in this limit, from it we deduce

c (k)(e, 0) 

sin((k+1)e)

sin(e)

.

24

(7.7)

this correctly reproduces the spectra for the higher problems that in [37] had to be
obtained by a series of independent calculations.

8 singular potentials and duality

up to now the parameter m has been restricted to the range (0,), but simple trans-
formation properties of the schrodinger equation allow a wider range of m to be accom-
modated. the idea is to dene a mapping between the eigenvalue problem for m > 0
and the problem with 1 < m < 0. our discussion here is not meant to be particularly
original, essentially following [9], but we wish to underline the fact that the relevance
of integral equations to schrodinger problems, stressed in [1], actually applies to wider
range of problems than might initially be thought. the rst step is to make langers [38]
variable change

y(x, e, l) = ez/2(z, e, l) .

(m +1)2m em1 .

(8.3)

(8.4)

(8.5)

it is easy to check that for m = 1 (8.5) gives an exact mapping between the energy
levels of the harmonic oscillator at angular momentum l and those of the coulomb
potential at angular momentum l = l/2  1/4. indeed it is straightforward to see that
eigenfunctions of the original problem are transformed into eigenfunctions for the dual
problem: reversing the original variable change, we have that

y(x, e, l) = (m +1)1/2e1/4x

m

2(m +1) y((m +1)e1/2x1/(m +1), e, l)

(8.6)

solves

 

d2
dx2  x2 m +

l(l+1)

x2  e! y(x, e, l) = 0 ,

(8.7)

with m = (m +1)1  1. furthermore, if y decays as x  + then so does y, and if
y  xl+1 near x = 0 then y  xl+1. hence eigenfunctions are mapped to eigenfunctions,

25

and the relation (8.5) is true at the level of the eigenvalues too. a curious consequence
of this transformation, applied to the problem with m = 1/2 and l = 0, is that the
solution of the x2/3 potential with l = 1/6 can be written in terms of the airy
function.
the mapping to singular potentials, decaying (albeit algebraically) at innity, high-
lights the fact that the motion of the zeroes of the q-operators as a function of the
twist p corresponds to the motion of regge poles for the radial schrodinger equation
as the angular momentum l is continuously varied [12, 13, 39]. quite apart from the
intrinsic curiosity of this fact, it means that the general results of, for example, chapters
8 and 13 of [13] can be applied to deduce features of the motion of the zeroes of the
q-operators as p and 2, or equivalently l and e, are varied. observe also that, from
the point of view of integrable eld theory, the duality m  m sends 2 to 1/2. as
m passes through 0 into the dual regime 1 < m < 0, 2 increases through 1 and
the associated perturbation of a c = 1 conformal eld theory becomes irrelevant. the
full range 1 < m <  is mapped onto 0 < 2 < . for m < 1, the nature of the
schrodinger problem (2.1) changes fundamentally, as the singularity at the origin ceases
to be regular. formally m < 1 corresponds to purely imaginary values of , and it is
tempting to suppose that there should be a relation with the non-compact sinh-gordon
model. however at this stage this is pure speculation.

9 conclusions

in this paper we have further explored the correspondence between certain integrable
quantum eld theories and schrodinger equations. the two natural classes of spectral
problems for these equations have been associated with the two types of operators which
arise in the integrable quantum eld theories, namely the t and q-operators. the
neatness of this t convinces us that the matching is no accident, and that it promises
to lead to a fruitful interaction between these previously distinct elds. a new angle on
the theory of integrable models seems to be opening up, and this alone should justify
some further work on the many unresolved issues which remain.

on a technical level, while we have tried to give most of the details of our calcula-
tions, our discussion has not been completely rigorous and some aspects will probably
repay a more careful treatment.
in addition, the treatment of this paper should be
completed with a full discussion of the quantum (non-semiclassical) domain m < 1.
this is particularly important because the region includes the unitary minimal mod-
els. one example, the airy case (m = 1/2, l = 0), has already been treated in [8],
and its consistency with integrable eld theory predictions has been conrmed both
numerically [1] and analytically [40].

the literature on the spectral theory of the (radial) schrodinger equation is exten-
sive, much of it dating back to regge pole theory, and we can hope to apply further
results to the study of integrable quantum eld theories.
in the other direction, the
realisation that the some of the functional relations uncovered by sibuya, voros and

26

others in connection with ordinary dierential equations also arise in integrable models,
and can be solved by means of nonlinear integral equations, promises to be very useful.
it should be remarked that functional relations can be found for more general potentials
than the x2m + l(l+1)x2 cases used above (see [11, 23, 41]). it would be interesting
to know if these also have a role to play in the theory of integrable models. a relation
between certain functional relations and dierential equations was recently discussed
in [42], though the approach is rather dierent from that adopted here.

the match that we have found connects spectral determinants of the schrodinger
equation with the vacuum expectation values of the t and q-operators. however
this leaves to one side all of the other expectation values, which emerge when excited
states in the integrable quantum eld theories are discussed. they obey the same sets of
functional relations as the vacuum expectation values [7,24,26,27], and a major challenge
is to nd an interpretation for them within the context of schrodinger equations. one
way to access excited states in integrable quantum eld theories is by a process of
analytic continuation in a suitable parameter [18]. however if we remain with the
massless models discussed in this paper, this idea is unlikely to help since the functions
 and y are single-valued in the one remaining parameter, namely l (see [13,29]). if the
correspondence could be extended to cover massive models, then the story would change
since these models are already known to exhibit a pattern of branch points joining the
ground state to excited states (examples can be found in [18, 43]). whether massive
models can be incorporated into the dierential equation framework is another question
that for the moment remains completely open, and any progress on this issue would be
extremely interesting.

appendix a wkb details

in this appendix we sketch how to obtain (2.21). the equation describes the asymp-
totic behaviour of log d(e, l) = w [y(x, e, l), +(x, e, l)]. note rst that d can be
evaluated as

for convenience we set e = a, so that the problem under discussion becomes

d(e, l) = lim

and we are interested in the behaviour as |a|  +. the wkb approximation cannot
be applied directly to this equation, because of the nature of its singularity at x = 0 [38].

27

the remedy found in [38] is to make the variable change x = ez, y(x) = ez/2(z).
writing  = l + 1/2 the equation becomes

(cid:18)

d2

dz2 + r(z, a, )(cid:19)  = 0

(a.3)

with r(z, a, ) = e(2m +2)z + ae2z + 2. the wkb approximation for  is

b

r(z, a, )1/4

exp(cid:20)z z

z0pr(u, a, ) du(cid:21) .

(a.4)
in contrast to the wkb treatment of the initial equation, this is approximation is good
for all real z (and hence for x all the way down to zero) since r3/4(r1/4) tends to
zero uniformly in z as |a|  +, so long as arg a 6=  (for a discussion, see [44]).
the solution that we hope to approximate is subdominant as x  +, which
requires a = 0. the value of b must be chosen so as to match the large-x asymptotic
(2.2). a little thought shows that the correctly-normalised approximate solution can be
written as

(z, a, )

exp(cid:20)z 

z

[pr(u, a, )  e(m +1)u]du

e(m +1)z(cid:21) (a.5)

to estimate (a.1) we need to analyse this quantity as z  . an integration by parts
extracts a term z in this limit, after which  can be dropped from the remaining
integral, giving a leading a-dependence

(z, a, )  1/2 exp(cid:20)z +z

reverting to the original variables and substituting into (a.1), it is easily checked that
the result quoted in the main text is recovered.

if m < 1, the above treatment fails, because the integral in (a.5) diverges. the

order. for example, if 1/3 < m < 1 the argument of the exponential in (a.5) should
be replaced by

and so the result (2.22) is preserved  we have simply continued it around the pole
at m = 1. despite the fact that the |e|   asymptotic of d is unchanged, the
move to m < 1 does have an eect on the limiting behaviour of the auxiliary function
d(e, l)  2l+1d(2e, l)/d(2e, l) used in 2. the correct choice of branches
when applying the asymptotic (2.21) at the shifted arguments 2e changes, with the
result that the asymptotic log d(e, l)   1
2 ib0(e) now holds in the revised sector
m +1 < arg(e) < 2m
 2m
m +1 . outside this sector, the leading contributions cancel and so
all that can be concluded is that the asymptotic is subleading, though from the nonlinear
integral equation (2.32) we expect that it will be o(1), and in fact equal to (2l+1)i.
