ads3/cft2 correspondence at nite temperature

abstract

the ads/cft correspondence is established for the ads3 space compactied on a solid torus with
the cft eld on the boundary. correlation functions that correspond to the bulk theory at nite
temperature are obtained in the regularization ala gubser, klebanov, and polyakov. the btz black
hole solutions in ads3 are t-dual to the solution in the ads3 space without singularity.

introduction

the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] has been veried for interacting eld cases [4, 5] (three- and
four-graviton scattering, etc.) and it is interesting to check it also in cases where the spacetime
geometry is more involved than the spherical one. various approaches to this problem were proposed
in [7] and [6].

in [7], it was proposed, starting from a two-dimensional (compact) manifold m , to consider a
theory on the space m  r+ endowed with the ads metric. from the topological standpoint, this,
however, results in a singularity as s  r  + (because m is not necessarily simply connected),
and one must impose an additional condition on the elds of the theory (the fast decrasing at innity)
in order to make the eld conguration smooth.

in [6], we considered the massless scalar eld theory on ads3 space. (the method can be general-
ized to the massive modes of adsn  sd+1 space.) in this paper, we also consider the case of a general
(not necessarily rectangular) torus and discuss the physical content of the results obttained. we also
consider the case of a homogeneously compactied ads3 manifold without (topological) singularity
in the interior (as there is no boundary as s  ; our calculations technically resemble the bulk
calculations of [5]). we show that the classical scalar eld theory on the ads3 manifold in the bulk
gives us the appropriate quantum correlators on the boundary.

the compactication corresponds to considering the nite temperature case, so we calculate cor-
relators of boundary elds for the ads3 space at nite temperature [8]. following [8], one must take
into account all possible solutions of the einstein gravity that have the anti-de sitter metric at innity.
in the ads3 case, however, the black-hole solutions of hawking and page [9, 8] turn out [10, 11] to be
t-dual to the case of a pure ads3 space without internal singularities; this holds for the corresponding
correlation functions as well.

in sec. 2, we recall the general structure of ads3 manifolds and introduce the -cone regularization
in order to make the volume and the boundary area nite. in sec. 3, we review the relationship between
the black hole and empty space solutions of the ads3 gravity. in secs. 4 and 5, we formulate the
scalar eld theory in ads3, while the corresponding correlation functions are calculated by using
an improved technique in sec. 6. separate investigation is performed for the case where a conical
singularity (the angle decit) is developed in the vicinity of a (unique) closed geodesic inside the solid
torus; the correlation functions are found for the case where the angle decit is a rational number
(sec. 7). a brief discussion is in sec. 8.

2 geometry of ads3 manifolds

the group sl(2, c) of conformal transformations of the complex plane admits the continuation to the
upper half-space h+
3 endowed with the constant negative curvature (ads3 space). in the schottky
uniformization picture, riemann surfaces of higher genera can be obtained from c by factorizing it
over a nitely generated free-acting discrete subgroup   sl(2, c). therefore, we can continue
the action of this subgroup to the whole ads3 and, after factorization, obtain a three-dimensional
manifold of constant negative curvature (an ads3 manifold) whose boundary is (topologically) a
two-dimensional riemann surface [12, 13].

we consider the simplest case of a genus one ads3 manifold obtained after the identication

(w, w, s)  (qw, qw, s|q|),

(2.1)

where q = e a+ib is the modular parameter, a, b  r, a > 0, w, w = x + iy, x  iy are the coordinates
on c, and s is the third coordinate on ads3.

adopting the ads/cft correspondence approach, we should rst regularize expressions in order
to make them nite. in the adsn case with the brane singularity at innity, this was done by setting
the boundary data on the -plane [2] rather than at innity (zero plane). however, in our case, we
cannot take an -plane because it is not invariant w.r.t. transformations (2.1). instead, we can set the
boundary data on the -conethe set of points

z/r = ,

r2 = ww + s2.

given the boundary data on this cone, we x the problem settingthe laplace equation then has a
unique solution (the dirichlet problem on a compact manifold).

geometrically, performing the -cone regularization and factorizing over the group  of transfor-
mations (2.1), we obtain the solid torus on whose boundary (the two-dimensional torus) the cft
elds dwell. the center of the torus is a unique closed geodesic, which has the length log |q| (the
image of the vertical half-line z = z = 0), while the ads-invariant distance r from this geodesic to the
image of the -cone is constant, cosh r = 1/.

3 black hole solution in ads3 in spherical coordinates

in order to operate with the cone geometry, it is convenient to reformulate the free-eld problem on
ads3 in the spherical coordinates r  e  , ,  [10] in which relations (2.1) read

(, , )  ( + ma, ,  + mb + 2n),

m, n  z,

(3.1)

where dl2 is the invariant interval squared. on the cone sin  = , the usual toric periodic conditions
are imposed on elds depending on the two-dimensional variables  and .

dl2 =(cid:0)d 2 + d2 + sin2  d2(cid:1)/ cos2 ,

we prefer to work in the standard spherical coordinates s = r cos , y = r sin  sin , and x =

r sin  cos . upon the identication

we obtain the ads3 metric in the standard form [9],

 = b tan ,

t = b log r,  =

1 + 2/b2 d2 + 2d2,

(3.2)

(3.3)

with elds to be regular at  = 0.

the remarkable fact is that the spinning black hole solution metric (with the nonzero angular

momentum j and mass m ) given by the interval

therefore, metric (3.4) with the respective (two-dimensional) radial and angular coordinates 
and  becomes metric (3.1) with the respective coordinates  and . note that (for j = 0) radial and
angular coordinates readily interchange and we obtain the torus that is t -dual to the initial one.

important particular case is d = 2 (ads3 s3) where  = l/2+1 and we must use formula (4.11) in
order to nd the asymptotic behavior. in this case, the nonlocality is again encoded in the -function
terms.

6 correlation function for massless modes

turn now to expression (4.13). the mode multiplier is the fourier transform of the correlation function
of the boundary cft eld on the torus. we are interested in the nonlocal contribution to greens
functions on torus coming from this formula and disregard all local terms, which can be removed by a
proper renormalizing procedure. (therefore, we consider two-point correlation functions rather than
greens functions for a two-dimensional problem; the latter are distributions and necessarily demand
local contributions to be taken into account [15].)

the m-dependence in (4.13) is analytic [6] and we may represent the -function using the formula

(1 + a)  (1 + b) =



xj=0(cid:18)

1 + j + b



1

1 + j + a(cid:19) .

let us nd the cft correlation functions that follow from (4.13). the term (cid:16) m2

the summand is nothing but the laplacian action on the riemann surface, i.e., we obtain that the
correlation function is

therefore, the remaining nonlocal terms are combined into the sum

(6.8)

this is the correlation function of two yangmills tensor eld insertions on torus obtained in [6] for
b = 0. at singularity points, it has the proper behavior g(r)  1/r4, which is character for the weight
two cft elds.

7 exact correlation function for the conical singularity case

using our technique, we are able to nd the correlation functions also in the case where a conical
singularity appears at the axis  = 0 of metric (3.1). this corresponds to the following double
periodic conditions for the variable z =  + i:

z  z +

2i
a

,

z  z +

2
ad

, where

 = a + ib,

a, b, d  r.

(7.1)

actually, we can calculate the correlation function in the most general case with torsion where 
variable is also shifted by the rst transformation. then, the two-dimensional eigenfunctions are

k,l(, ) = e i(al+ck)+i(lb+kd)

(7.2)

6

(in (7.1), we set c = 0) and the formula for the function yk,m(sin ) is exactly (4.10) where we must
set

m = al + kc,

w = lb + kd.

(7.3)

then, acting similarly to (6.1)(6.6), we obtain the expression with the single remaining summation
over n,

where   a + ib,   c + id, and   ad + bc.

from now on, we restrict the consideration only to the case without torsion, c = 0. also, we

assume a  z+ to be a positive integer. then, (7.4) becomes

the formula (7.5) resembles (6.8) with one, but important, dierence. we can write (6.8) as

(cid:0)z + (a + ib)p + 2im1(cid:1)2(cid:0)z + (a  ib)p + 2im2(cid:1)2 .

in expression (7.6), the singularities in z and z come always at the same p, but at all possible
(independent) shifts in the angular variable . exrpession (7.7) enjoys the rst of these properties but
angular shifts are no more independentthe mismatch is always an multiple of a and, for instance,
in the limit a  , the zero mismatch term prevails, which automatically produces a t -dual answer.

8 discussion

having an ads asymptotic metric in the boundary domain, we can continue it in a bulk in (at least
two) dierent ways: as an empty space or as a space with the btz black hole singularity. from the
cft standpoint, these two continuations are connected by the t -duality transformation; therefore,
adopting a viewpoint that we must take a sum over all possible continuations of the ads metric
(related, probably, to instantonic modes) for obtaining a proper correlation function on the boundary,
we obtain, instead of (6.8), the sum of (6.8) and its t -dual.

7

obtained expression (6.8) describes the two-point correlator hg2

(z, z)i of the yangmills
tensor insertions at nonzero temperature, which, from the conformal eld theory standpoint, corre-
sponds to the case of a rectangular torus. this demonstrates again that the ads/cft correspondence
holds in our case where no singularity at the ads time innity is assumed. a more interesting (but
far more involved technically) is the problem of verifying this correspondence in actual gravitational
calculations of a multi-point correlation functions.

 (0, 0)g2

the last problem to discuss is the t -duality under the modular transformation a  1/a in dierent
prescriptions. in the prescription of [7]. it is possible to obtain the solid torus by factorizing the ads3
space with respect to the action of the abelian group generated by two shifts (parabolic elements of
sl(2, c)): z  z + 1 and z  z + i (the third coordinate, s, is invariant). then, the fundamental
domain is the half-innite cylinder 0 < z  1, 0 < z  ,  < s < m and, geometrically, this
corresponds (in the three-dimensional picture) to the closed torus inside which there is a singular (as
m  ) torus of ads radius  1/m and length /m . then, in the limit   0, m  , the
corresponding temperature correlation function becomes

gbon(z, z) 



xn,m=

(z + n + im)2(z + n  im)2 ,

1

which apparently diers from (6.8) but coincides with (7.5) in the limit a   (with the proper
rescaling of  and the greens function). this, however, is not very surprising as the case a  
corresponds to the case where the factorization group is generated by two parabolic (oricyclic) elements
of the sl(2, c) group.

already in the free eld theory, there remain questions on the mass spectrum, on the generalization
to higher dimensions, etc. of special interest is the question how to consider solid riemann surfaces of
higher genera. the construction works well in this case, but the -regularized surface, or the boundary
of the integation domain, cannot be described in the invariant distance terms (the structure of the set
of closed geodesics becomes very involved already starting from genus two); however, we hope that one
can obtain a proper answer using an approximation technique. in the present calculations, we disregard
all local contributions. however, these contributions becomes important when considering additional
boundary terms in the initial action.
it would be interesting to check whether the hamiltonian
prescription of [16] holds in this case.

it is also interesting to relate the obtained correlation functions (6.8) and (7.5) with the s-matrix

scattering problem in ads3 [17].
