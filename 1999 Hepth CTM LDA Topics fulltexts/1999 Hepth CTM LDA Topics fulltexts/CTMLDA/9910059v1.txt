abstract

in this brief note we construct the propagator for the antisymmetric ten-
sor in adsd+1. we check our result using the poincare duality between the
antisymmetric tensor and the gauge boson in ads5. this propagator was
needed for a computation which turned out to be too hard. it can be used
for computing various other things in ads.

i. introduction

in [1,2], a lot of eort was put into nding the ads propagators for the graviton and
the gauge boson. their methods can be used straightforwardly for the b propagators. an
ansatz can be made for bitensor propagators. this ansatz contains both gauge artifacts and
gauge invariant parts. upon using the equation of motion for b we obtain an equation for
the gauge invariant part of the propagator, whose solution is hypergeometric. for d=5 it
simplies to an algebraic function of the chordal distance. as explained in [1], working on
the subspace of conserved sources makes gauge xing unnecessary. we check our result by
verifying the 5-dimensional poincare duality between a and b.

ii. the b propagator

in euclidean adsd+1, with the metric

ds2 =

1
z2
0

(dz2

i ),

0 + d

i=1dz2

(1)

the easiest way to express invariant functions and tensors is in terms of the chordal distance:

(z0  w0)2 + (zi  wi)2

2z0w0

.

u 

the action for an antisymmetric 2-tensor coupled to a conserved source s is:

where

sb = z dd+1zg[

1
2  3!

h h 

1
2

bs],

h = db + db + db.

the euler lagrange equation has a solution of the form:

b(z) =

1

2 z dd+1wgg; (z, w)s 

(w),

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

where g;  is the bitensor propagator. to simplify notation, the ds with unprimed
indices mean covariant derivatives with respect to z, and those with primed indices with
respect to w. the equation g;  satises is:

d(dg;  + dg;  + dg; ) = (z, w)(gg   g g)+

+d;   d ;,

(6)

where ;  is a dieomorphism whose contribution vanishes when integrated against the
covariantly conserved source s. we can see that all of our bitensors are antisymmetric at
both points.

similarly to the methods in [1] we observe that a suitable basis for antisymmetric biten-

sors is given by:

t 1
;  = u u   uu

(7)

2

t 2
;  = uu u   uuu  uu u +  uuu.

thus, an ansatz for g is g = t 1f 1(u) + t 2f 2(u). nonetheless, we use a dierent decom-
position, which illustrates better the gauge artifacts

g;  = t 1

; h(u) + dv;   dv; ,

(8)

where v;  = y (u)[u u   uu]. also, an antisymmetric ;  can be ex-
pressed as
(10)

;  = a(u)[ uu   uu].

we can now substitute (8) and (10) in (6), and after a long computation we obtain

d(dg;  + dg;  + dg; )  d;  + d ; =

= t 1[h u(u + 2) + h (1 + u)(d  1)  2a]  t 2[h (1 + u) + h (d  1) + a].

(11)
for z 6= w, we obtain 2 equations by setting the scalar coecients of the two tensors to 0.
we can observe that the v;  part which was a gauge artifact dropped out as expected.
thus, for u 6= 0 we have the equations:

h u(u + 2) + h (1 + u)(d  1)  2a = 0

h (1 + u) + h (d  1) + a = 0.

(12a)

(12b)

the second equation can be integrated once, with the integration constant chosen so that
a and h vanish as u  . combining this with (12a) we nd the dierential equation
obeyed by h:

u(2 + u)h (u) + (d + 1)(u + 1)h (u) + 2(d  2)h = 0.

(13)

this equation is hypergeometric, but for d = 4 the solution which vanishes as u   is

h(u) =

((d  1)/2)
4(d+1)/2

u + 1

[u(u + 2)](d1)/2 ,

properly normalized to take care of the  function in (6).

iii. poincar e duality

in 5 dimensions a 2-form is poincare dual with a gauge boson, by the relation:

h = 3! f 

therefore, we expect:

hf (z)f 

(w)i =

1
(3!)2  

hh(z)h (w)i.

checking (16) is a verication that our result is true. we use the fact that

hbb i = g; 

3

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

and

haai = g;,

(18)

where the second propagator was found in [2]. we could check the tensor equality (16) term
by term, but it is messy. we rather observe that the right hand side of (16) is a bitensor
antisymmetric at both ends, and thus it will have the structure
hh(z)h (w)i = f1(u)t ; 

+ f2(u)t ; 

 

(19)

.

concentrating on the components of hf z0zi(z)f z 

0z 

j (w)i we obtain:

2f1 + f2(1 + u) = h ,

f2(1 + u)2 + f2 + 2f1(1 + u) = 2h (1 + u) + 3h ,

(20a)

(20b)

which give the same f1 and f2 as the ones obtained from the gauge propagator derived in
[2].

iv. conclusion

we computed the propagator for b in adsd+1 and checked our result by using poincare
duality for d = 4. this propagator can be used for computing various quantities having to
do with b charged objects (like strings or d-branes with electric ux) in ads.
