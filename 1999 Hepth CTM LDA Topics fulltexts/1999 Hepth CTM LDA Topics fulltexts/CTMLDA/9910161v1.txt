abstract

we present a new solution in the heterotic mtheory in which the metric

depends on (cosmic) time. the solution preserves n = 1 supersymmetry
in 4 dimensions in the leading order of the 2/3 expansion. it is the rst

example of the timedependent supersymmetric solution in mtheory on
s1/zz 2. it describes expanding 4dimensional spacetime with shrinking
orientifold interval and static calabiyau internal space.

october 1999

the mtheoretic extension of the heterotic e8  e8 string leads to a geomet-
ric picture of two 10dimensional walls (branes) at the ends of a nite interval

along eleventh dimension [1, 2]. while the supergravity multiplet (gravition,

gravitino and antisymmetric tensor elds) can penetrate in the d = 11 bulk, the

two e8 gauge multiplets are conned to the two walls, respectively. the role of
the walls can in general be played by higher dimensional p-branes that support

gauge groups. when six of the dimensions are compactied (at the lowest or-

der on a calabiyau space) one obtains phenomenologically promising models

with gauge elds living on the d = 4 walls. one should however remember that

such a compactication should be consistent with the 11dimensional equations

of motion.

within this heterotic mtheory it is possible to unify the gravitational con-

stant with the gauge coupling constants at the mtheory fundamental scale. as-

suming such a unication and using measured values of the newtons constant

gn and of the gauge coupling constants one can deduce scales of compactica-
tion. these scales of the internal dimensions are of the order of 1015 gev for the
x11 interval and 1016 gev for the calabiyau space [2, 3, 4]. these energy scales

are very similar to the characteristic scales in the early universe, for example

during inationary period. therefore it is natural to ask whether cosmological

solutions (with the metric depending on time) are possible in mtheory.

the problem of nding cosmological solutions in mtheory has been addressed

in several papers. some of them discuss solutions within strongly coupled limit

of the heterotic string theory (heterotic mtheory). one of the approaches in

this case consists in using an eective 5dimensional theory with walls [5]. the

domain wall solutions [6] are generalized by introducing time dependence of their
parametrs. this aproach can be justied [7] because the scale of the x11 interval

is lower than the calabiyau scale. but one should check a posteriori whether

the 11dimensional equations of motion are satised and it is a very stringent

requirement. in another approach one looks for solutions in the theory with walls

by continuation of pbranes to the euclidean space [8].

other papers discuss solutions within 11 or 10dimensional supergravities

without walls (general mtheory, less promising phenomenologically). there one

assumes dierent compact, internal manifolds (for example squashed spheres [9]

or tori [10]) or compactication by the scherkschwarz mechanism [11] (giving a

static universe with domainwalls).

in the case of the heterotic mtheory none of the cosmological solutions pro-

posed up to now preserves n = 1 d = 4 supersymmetry. the purpose of this

paper is to generalize the result of ref. [2] and prove that such a supersymmetric

solution is possible.

the low energy limit of the heterotic mtheory is given by the following

lagrangian [1]:

where i, j, k, . . . = 1, 2, . . . , 11; x, y, z . . . = 1, 2, . . . , 10 and n = 1, 2 counts

the 10dimensional boundaries (walls) of the space. the rst integral in (1)

describes the supergravity in the 11dimensional bulk (metric gij , three-form
cijk and spin 3/2 gravitino i) while the second one describes interactions of
the super yangmills elds (gauge eld strengths f a
n) living on
two 10dimensional walls. the eld strength of c is given by gijkl = (icjkl
permutations) and g is the supercovariant eld strength. the signature of the
space-time manifold m 11 is ( + . . . +); gamma matrices obey {i, j} = 2gij
and i1i2...in = (1/n!) (i1i2 . . . in  permutations).

in the above lagrangian only the rst two terms in the long wavelength ex-
pansion are kept. they are of relative order 2/3. all higher order terms (order
4/3 or higher) will be consistently dropped in this paper.

we now try to nd a timedependent solution that preserves at least some of

the supersymmetries generalizing the method employed in [2].

the supersymmetry transformation law for i is

i = di +

2
288

(ijklm  8gijklm ) gjklm  .

(2)

the condition for a spinor  to generate an unbroken supersymmetry is the van-

2

ishing of the r.h.s. of (2):
2
288

di +

(ijklm  8gijklm )gjklm  = 0 .

(3)

in the above equation we use the covariant (and not supercovariant) eld strength

because we assume that vacuum expectation values of all fermion elds vanish.
to the zeroth order in 2/3 the 11dimensional spacetime in the heterotic

mtheory is of the form m 11 = m 4  x 6  s1/zz 2.
indices a, b, c, . . . run
from 5 to 10 and are tangent to x 6; a, b, c, . . . = 1, 2, 3 are holomorphic indices
tangent to x 6, and a, b, c, . . . = 1, 2, 3 are analogous antiholomorphic indices;
, , , . . . = 1, 2, 3, 4 are d = 4 spacetime indices while i, j, k, . . . = 2, 3, 4 are

space indices.

we are looking for a solution of the supersymmetry condition (3) in the pres-
ence of nonvanishing vev of gjklm of the order of 2/3. first we perturb the
metric:

ds2 = ( + b) dxdx + 2(gab + hab)dxadx

b + (1 + c)(dx11)2

(4)

where b, h, and c are functions of order 2/3 and we will neglect higher order
corrections. we take the zeroth order metric on m 4 to be the minkowski one
dxdx. x 6 is to zeroth order a calabi-yau manifold with a metric gab with
non-zero components gab = gba. a kahler form on x 6 is ab with non-zero
components ab = igab = ba.

under a perturbation of the metric gij  gij + gij, to rst order in g,
the covariant derivative of a spinor changes by di  di  1
4dj gkijk.
introducing the covariantly constant (with respect to the unperturbed metric)

spinor eld 0 we write

 = ep0,

p being also of order 2/3.

then the rst term in eq. (3) is

dxidi =

+dx

b (gacdchab) + dx11(cid:16)bc

(5)

(6)

the zz 2 invariance requires that the supersymmetry transformation parameter 
obeys chirality condition 11 = . to simplify calculations it is also convenient

3

to assume that a = 0. for spinors which are singlets of the su(3) holonomy
group of x 6 this reduces to the weyl condition 5 =  in d = 4 (where
5 = i1234 and condition a = 0 would correspond to the opposite 4
dimensional chirality). from weyltype solutions of the supersymmetry condition

we can construct majoranatype solutions if needed.

supersymmetry condition (3) with the perturbed metric (4) can be solved

only if some of the components of the eld strength tensor g are nonzero. it was

shown in [2] that the following components of g

 = abcdgabcd ,
a = bcgabc 11 ,
ab = cdgabcd

(7)

(8)

(9)

must be nonzero in the presence of sources. looking for solutions depending on

spacetime coordinates we have to assume that there are more nonvanishing com-

ponents of g. if we are looking for supersymmetric solutions the only additional

components allowed are of the type g11ab. therefore, we dene

 = iabg11ab .

(10)

there are no sources entering the bianchi identity for this quantity. it was argued

in [2] that sourceless components of g should vanish since g with indices

tangent to the internal space must be cohomologically trivial. this argument does
not apply to g11ab because d = 4 spacetime is not compact and boundaryless
so even without sources allows for constant eld strengths.

with the above denitions the second term in the supersymmetry condition

(3) can be written as

(11)

perturbations of the metric and the supesymmetry generating spinor:

(17)

the other equations are the same as those obtained in [2].

one can check that eq. (3) has no solutions with nonzero components of g

other than those given in eqs. (710).

in order to check the consistency of the above set of equations we use the

following bianchi identity

(dg)11ab = g11ab  g11ab = 0 .

contracting it with ab we get

   = 0 .

(18)

(19)

it is easy to check that equations (18) and (19) are the integrability conditions

for equations (12)(15) (integrability conditions for (16) and (17) were discussed

in [2]).

in the potential application of the solutions of (12)(17) to cosmological sit-

uations the natural assumption is to allow for dependence of all elds on the
cosmic time (t = x1) but not on the space coordinates (we are perturbing at

minkowski spacetime so spaces with topologically dierent space-like sections

are excluded). therefore we assume

gi11ab = 0 .

(20)

the equation of motion for g reads

the r.h.s. of the above equation may be nonzero for general vacuum expectation

values of g given by eqs. (710). however, as shown in ref. [2], quantities , a
and ab are all of order 2/3. we are going to restrict our analysis to situations
when  is also of the order of 2/3 ( of order 1 would not satisfy equations of
motion at the leading order). for g satisfying this condition the r.h.s. of eq. (21)
is of higher order (4/3) and should be dropped.

from now on we will use for simplicity the cartesian coordinates to parametrize

m 4. then, the equations of motion and bianchi identities relevant for us are:

11gt11ab = 0 ,

 tgt11ab + dcgc11ab + dcgc11ab = 0 ,
(dg)t11abc = (dg)t11abc = (dg)ti11ab = 0 .

(22)

(23)

(24)

by introducing gt11ab we dont want to change to the lowest order the g

components in the solution of [2] so we assume

tgt11ab = igt11ab = cgt11ab = cgt11ab = 0 .

(25)

we can do this in a consistent way because the bianchi identities for the added
components of g (gt11ab) have no sources at the walls.

contracting (25) with ab we get

1 = const .

(26)

the explicit solution to eqs. (12)(17) reads (we drop xa and xa dependence

analyzed in [2]):

btt(t, x11) = (cid:16)x11 + f1(t)(cid:17) tt ,
bij(t, x11) = (cid:16)x11 + t(cid:17) ij ,
c(t, x11) = 2(cid:16)f2(x11) + t(cid:17) ,
2 (cid:16)x11 + t(cid:17) .
p(t, x11) =

where  = 2
24  and f1(t)
and f2(x11) are arbitrary functions reecting the freedom of coordinate choice of
time and x11. we have dropped the arbitrary constants to make the result look

simpler.

(33)

it is important to analyse the volume of x 6 because it determines the value

of the gauge coupling constants. its dependence on the spacetime coordinates

is given by

substituting (13) into this formula we get

v6 = z d6xqg(6) = z d6xqg(6)gabhab .
v6 = z d6xqg(6)gab 2
= z d6xqg(6) 2

gab + 2g11ab!
 + 2gabg11ab! = 0 .

2

(31)

(32)

in these equalities we used the denition of  (eq. (10)) and the fact that the
complex dimension of x 6 is equal to 3. thus, v6 depends only on x11 but not on
time:

this fact that the volume of calabiyau space, v6, does not depend on time
(as shown in eq. (32)) has important consequences. the squares of the gauge

coupling constants are inversely proportional to the volume of the calabiyau

space v6. therefore the gauge coupling constants do not depend explicitly on
time.

on the other hand, the scale factor of the 3dimensional space and the length
of s1/zz2 do change in time. to discuss possible expansion or contraction of
internal or space-time dimensions it is convenient to x f1(t). apart from the x11
dependence, the usual cosmic time prescription amounts to putting f1(t) = 0 and
that is our choice (we also x the x11 coordinate freedom by choosing f2(x11) = 0).
it is interesting that when we choose the sign of  positive so that it describes

expanding space (space hubble parameter positive) then the solution describes
shrinking x11 scale factor.

since the length of the x11 interval in this solution may depend on time we

have to reconsider the question of the connection between the newtons constant

and the gauge coupling constant at the gut scale. for the timeindependent

solutions these relations read

gn =

gu t =

v 0

(34)

(35)

where r11 =  in the length of the s1/zz 2 interval, v 0
6 = v6(x11 = 0) is
the volume of x 6 at our wall and v6 is the averaged (over x11) volume of x 6.
eliminating  we get

r11 =

since in the linear approximation

(36)

11  1015gev .
r1

(38)

plugging this value back into eq. (33) we have to require that the volume of x 6

11 . this critical length rcrit
11

at the other wall is positive which gives an upper bound on the length of s1/zz 2:
r11 < rcrit
turns out to be close to the value (38)
obtained from arguments based on phenomenology. one could expect that the
evolution of the length of the x11 interval could violate the condition r11 < rcrit
11
for large enough negative t. however, this is not the case. rcrit
is obtained
11

from the condition that v6 must be positive at both walls. we can see from eq.
(33) that since x11 is the comoving coordinate the volume v6 does not change
with time and stays positive along the whole x11 interval. the physical length of
the interval changes with time but this is compensated by the change of rcrit
11

induced by the change of the newtons constant as shown in eq. (34).

let us analyse the resulting metric in some more detail. we assume (as
everywhthe evolution of the length of the x11 interval ere else in the paper) that
we keep only linear terms in 2/3. therefore the 5-dimensional metric reads

ds2 = (cid:16)1 + x11(cid:17) dt2 +(cid:16)1 + x11 + t(cid:17) (dxi)2 + (1  2t)(dx11)2 .

(39)

the riemann tensor calculated from the above metric has an expansion in powers

of  and  starting from quadratic terms. therefore the riemann tensor com-
ponents are of the order 4/3 and the equations of motion relating the einstein
tensor with the square of g are satised to order 2/3 (it is a similar situation as

in [2]).

the metric (39) may depend on time while preserving 4 supersymmetry

charges corresponding to n = 1 supersymmetry in d = 4 (this is similar to

8

the anti de sitter space where supersymmetry can be preserved although the

metric depends on the spatial coordinates). this fact is extremely important

since preserved supersymmetry in a given background (with globally well dened

elds) guarantees that this background satises the 11dimensional equations of

motion. thus, the solution described in this paper is the rst approximation (in
the 2/3 expansion) to the timedependent solutions in mtheory and it is the

rst example of such a solution.

since 4dimensional supersymmetry is preserved one should be able to identify

an appropriate 4dimensional gravitino eld. this could be done using methods

of ref. [12] generalized to the time dependent case.

the metric (39) is known in the linear approximation only, so we cannot make

any denite statements about the global behaviour of the solution with time i.e.

whether it is an inationary-like solution or a power-like one or anything else.
a similar problem exists already in the case of x11 dependence. there we also

know the metric only in the linear approximation, but the problem with the global
behaviour is less severe because the length of x11 interval is nite (although large).

one may note that the presence of nonzero gt11ab may be important for the
it stems from the fact that the contribution

cosmological constant problem.

of these components to vacuum energy has the opposite sign compared to the

contribution of other components of g present in the static solution.

if we extend validity of the metric (39) to arbitrary time we can derive a rather

suprising lower bound on the value of gt11ab. the argument goes as follows. one
can see that the speed of light in the x11 direction is given by

v2
11 =

1 + x11
1  2t

.

(40)

we can also introduce a velocity with which a xed space scale factor travels
along the x11 direction:

vsf = 




.

(41)

the metric (39) describes an initial singularity (space scale factor vanishes) for

x11 + t = 1

(42)

so the singularity at the other wall (x11 = ) is earlier than at our wall (x11 = 0).

on physical grounds the signal about the beginning of expansion from a point
on x11 should not reach a nearby point before the expansion has started there.

9

therefore the speed of light |v11| should not be greater than |vsf| at each point
on x11 axis. this condition gives

  s 1 + x11

3 + 2 x11 


3

.

in terms of our original elds it can be translated as

gt 11 abab >

zx 6

4

3 zx 6

gabcdabcd .

(43)

(44)

this lower bound on rx 6 gt 11 abab is quite surprising. it shows that whenever

we switch on nonzero vev for gabab (what we anyway should do due to sources
on the walls in the bianchi identities) while keeping supersymmetry then the

solution is physically unstable unless we switch on also suciently large vev for

gt11ab. then the solution is necessarily timedependent. one should remember
however, that the bound can be modied by presently unknown higher order (in
2/3) terms.

in conclusion, we have presented the rst example of the time dependent

solution in the heterotic mtheory that preserves n = 1 d = 4 supersymmetry. it

describes expanding 4dimensional spacetime with shrinking orientifold interval

and static calabiyau internal space. as a result the gauge coupling constants do

not depend on time while the newtons constant increases with time. it remains

to be seen what are the global properties of such cosmological solutions in m

theory and how they can be used to describe the evolution of the early universe.
