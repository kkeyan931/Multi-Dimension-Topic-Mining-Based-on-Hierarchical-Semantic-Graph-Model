abstract

a mechanism for the dynamical mass generation of a non-abelian gauge eld which
is based on taking into account the contributions of the gauge eld vacuum congu-
rations into the formation of the physical vacuum is considered. for a model of the
physical vacuum as a superposition of abelian congurations the gauge eld propaga-
tor is calculated in the leading order of 1/d-expansion (d is a space-time dimension).
one-particle spectrum of the model corresponds to the gauge sector of su (2) georgi-
glashow model.

1 introduction

in the standard model the central role belongs to the higgs mechanism which gives the
masses to particles without violating the cardinal principles of theories, such as local gauge
invariance and renormalizability. the higgs mechanism is a well adjusted and ecient
machine, and its description rightfully occupies its honorable place in any textbook on the
modern high energy physics. however, in spite of all experimental eorts, no traces of the
scalar sector of the standard model have been found hitherto, and the problem on searching
alternatives to the higgs mechanism is quite actual.

the generation of mass of a gauge eld and the spontaneous symmetry breaking con-
nected with it are dened by the structure of the ground state of the theory, that is a physical
vacuum. modeling of this structure is the main problem of the dynamical symmetry breaking
description (see, for instance, [1]).

in this paper a mechanism for the dynamical mass generation of the non-abelian gauge
eld is considered which does not require entering a scalar eld and other additional elds.
here the gauge eld itself, more exactly its vacuum constituent undertakes the role of an
order parameter, which is played by the vacuum expectation of a scalar eld in the usual
higgs mechanism. appearance of such a vacuum constituent is a manifestation of a nontrivial
structure of physical vacuum of the quantum eld theory. this vacuum constituent arises
quite naturally in constructing an iteration solution of the schwinger-dyson equations by
the method, suggested in [2], [3], which we shall use in the present work as well.

to illustrate the method we examine the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the scalar
theory. (as is well known, this phenomenon is a foundation for the higgs mechanism in the

1

standard model.) consider the theory of a scalar eld  with the lagrangian

l =   m2 


2

()2.

(1)

(we are working in the minkowsky metric with g00 = 1, but will not distinguish between
the upper and lower indices to simplify the notations.)

the schwinger-dyson equation (see, for instance, [5]) for the generating functional g(j)

of the green functions of this model has the form


i

3g

jjj  (m2 + 2)

1
i

g
j + jg = 0.

(2)

here j(x) is a source of the eld (x). at  = 0 eq.(2) has the unique (up to a normalization
factor) solution

where c = (m2 + 2)1 is the free propagator.

gpert = exp{iz dxdyj(x)c(x  y)j(y)},

this solution is a foundation for the iterative solution of eq.(2) in the form of the per-
turbation series. at m2 < 0 such a solution is unstable  the physical vacuum in this
case diers from the trivial vacuum of the perturbation theory. to describe the solution in
this case, which corresponds the spontaneous symmetry breaking, let us consider another
iterative scheme: an expansion near the point j = 0. as a leading approximation, consider
the equation


i

3g(0)
jjj  (m2 + 2)

1
i

g(0)
j = 0,

and the iterative expansion for the generating functional

is constructed by the subsequent solution of the iteration scheme equations

g = g(0) + g(1) +    + g(n) +    ,


i

3g(n)
jjj  (m2 + 2)

1
i

g(n)
j = jg(n1).

leading approximation equation (3) has the solution

g(0)(j) = exp iz dx[vj + vj],

where v obeys the characteristic equation

(vv + m2 + 2)v = 0.

(3)

(4)

(5)

characteristic equation (5) has the form of a classical eld equation of the theory with
lagrangian (1), and its solution v is the vacuum expectation of the eld  in the leading
approximation of the given iteration scheme.

the trivial solution v  0 corresponds to the trivial perturbative vacuum, and the cor-
responding iterative expansion is the perturbation series, i.e. the usual perturbation theory
is a partial case of the given iteration scheme. at m2 < 0,  > 0, the green functions of
the perturbation theory maintain tachyon poles, which indicates the instability of the trivial

2

vacuum, but in this case another class of constant solutions of characteristic equation (5)
exists

the iteration scheme based on this solution is a perturbation theory over spontaneously
broken non-perturbative vacuum. for the construction of the iterations in this case, it is
convenient to go over to the new sources

vv = m2/.

j+ =

1

2vv

(vj + vj), j = i
2vv

(vj  vj).

in terms of these sources we obtain the solution of the rst-step iteration scheme equations
as g(1) = p (1)g(0), where

p (1) =

i

2 z dxdy{j+h j+ + jgj}.

here h = (2vv + 2)1 is the higgs boson propagator, and g = 2 is the goldstone
boson propagator.

therefore, the adequate choice of the vacuum constituent  the solution v of charac-
teristic equation (5)  denes the adequate structure of green functions and one-particle
spectrum of the theory.

we shall apply this scheme to the construction of the iterative solution for a non-abelian
gauge theory. corresponding characteristic equations have a great number of various solu-
tions, and a choice of a class of the solutions, i.e. the vacuum constituents, denes a choice
of the candidate to the physical vacuum of the theory. here we consider the simplest non-
trivial class of the solutions (abelian solutions, see below) and demonstrate that in the
leading order of 1/d-expansion this class of solutions leads to the dynamical realization of
su(2) georgi-glashow model [4].

since p0 = 1, the solution of this system for any n is a polynomial in sources j and
j. coecient functions of this polynomial dene the green functions. at each step the
equations of the iteration scheme give a closed system of equations for these functions. the
solution of the rst-step equations is a quadratic polynomial, dening two-point functions
(the propagators). at the second step the solution is a polynomial of the fourth degree,
dening three-and four-point functions, as well as corrections to the propagators, etc. to
eliminate ultraviolet divergences, it is necessary to modify the equations of the iteration
scheme by introducing the corresponding counterterms (see [2]). note that functions of the
leading approximation and of the rst step are ultraviolet-nite.

3 physical vacuum and vacuum constituents

in the leading approximation of considered iteration scheme the ground state (the physical
vacuum of the theory) is dened by a choice of solutions of the characteristic equation system
(14)-(15). each solution v  (v,g) of the characteristic equation system denes a partial
solution gv (j) of the iteration scheme. this solution will be referred to as corresponding
to a partial mode | v >.
the trivial solution v = g = 0 corresponds to the leading approximation g(0) = 1.
the iteration scheme based on this solution is a perturbation theory in the coupling constant
over the trivial perturbative vacuum. nontrivial solutions of the characteristic equations
dene non-perturbative modes. these solutions have a sense of the vacuum constituents
of the quantum elds a and c, like the vacuum constituent v of scalar eld in the higgs
mechanism ( see introduction).

the choice of the approximation for the description of the physical vacuum | 0 > must
ensure general physical requirements, such as poincare-invariance, cluster decomposition,
etc. in the higgs mechanism it is sucient to take the constant solution v = qm2/ for

this purpose.

in the case under consideration the situation is more complicated. obviously, the choice
of a separate partial mode with v 6= 0 as a leading approximation to the physical vacuum
(a candidate for the physical vacuum) does not ensure poincare-invariance of the theory.
notice, however, that schwinger-dyson equations (7)-(8) are the linear functional-dierential

equations for the generating functional, and any superposition of partial solutions p gv (j)

is also a solution of these equations. so we can choose a superposition of partial modes as
a candidate for the physical vacuum, and choose the generating functional of the physical
green functions as the superposition

< 0 | 0 >j= g(j) = x{v }

gv (j),

corresponding to a class {v } of solutions of the characteristic equations. we shall sup-
pose this superposition can be chosen in such a way that all the contributions, breaking
the poincare-invariance, are mutually canceled, and the resulting theory turns out to be
poincare-invariant. for instance, the expectation value of the gauge eld must disappear

< 0 | a | 0 >=

1
i

= 0,

g

j(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)j=0

in spite of the contributions of separate partial modes in this vacuum expectation can be
dierent from zero. further, the higher derivatives of the physical generating functional,
dening multipoint functions, must be translational-invariant after switching o the sources,
etc. the set of these conditions will ensure the poincare-invariance of the theory.

consider energetics. for energy density e of ground state exists the well-known formula

e = i log g(cid:30)z dx.

(16)

this formula denes, in essence, a change of normalization for generating functional, and its
direct application is dicult. a normalization-independent formula for the energy can be
obtained considering e as a function of parameters of lagrangian. dierentiating eq.(16)

candidate for physical vacuum, must possess the same energy.

4 ward-slavnov-taylor identities

gauge invariance imposes the restrictions on green functions which are known as ward-
slavnov-taylor identities. from the jacobi identities for the structure constants of the
gauge group the identity follows

d(a)d(a)f(a)  0.

(19)

acting by operator d(a) on schwinger-dyson equation (7) and taking into account (19)
we obtain the generating relation for the ward-slavnov-taylor identities

1
d(a)ag + gd(a)fc cg = d(a)jg.

(20)

dierentiating this relation and switching o the sources, we get the desired restrictions on
the green functions. as relation (20) is an identity, and gv (j) is a solution of schwinger-
dyson equations, these restrictions must be fullled for each separate partial mode.

if v 6= 0 or g 6= 0 their form is certainly dierent from that of the usual ward-
slavnov-taylor identities. relation (20) must be fullled in each order of the considered
iteration scheme that is the chain of relations of type (20) must be satised, where in the
left hand side g is changed for g(n), while in the right hand side  for g(n1). in the leading
approximation the consequence of (20) is the condition

1
d(v)v + gd(v)fg g = 0
on the solutions v and g of characteristic equations (14)-(15).

5 abelian congurations

(21)

characteristic equations (14)- (15) possess a rich ensemble of various solutions, that is a
reection of the complex vacuum structure of non-abelian gauge theory.
in this paper
we restrict ourselves to the analysis of the simplest solutions of these equations, bringing,
however, to nontrivial physical eects. first of all note that if we impose the subsidiary
condition

v = 0,

6

(22)

then, as is seen from (21), for the ghost vacuum eld g we can restrict ourselves to the
trivial solutions g = g = 0 without contradicting the gauge invariance condition. further,
there exist a class of the simplest solutions of characteristic equation (14), namely, abelian
solutions, for which the dependencies on the space-time coordinates and on isotopic variables
are separated:

v(x) = nv(x),

(23)

where n is a unit vector in the isotopic space. for such vacuum congurations all nonlinear
(non-abelian) terms in eq. (14) disappear, and, with condition (22) taken into account, this
equation becomes the dalambert equation 2v = 0.
for abelian solutions (23) from formula (18) we get

e0
g

= 0,

then for this class of solutions the ground state energy in leading approximation does not
depend on coupling constant. in this sense such class of solutions can be named quasiper-
turbative.

6 first-step equations

equations of the rst step dene gauge eld and ghost eld propagators. polynomial p (1) is
quadratic in sources and at g = g = 0 has the form

p (1) =

1
2i

j  d  j + ij  d  j.

(24)

here d  dab
propagator.

(x, y | v) is the gauge eld propagator; d  dab(x, y | v)  the ghost

the iteration scheme gives the following equation for d

d(v)d = 1.

(25)

from generating relation (20) one obtains the following relation for the longitudinal part of
d

1
d(v)d = d(v).

(26)

since from subsidiary condition (22) it follows that [,d(v)] = 0, then from (25) and (26)
we get
(27)

d = d  d(v).

at v = 0 : d = 2, and identity (27) gains the familiar form

d = 


2 .

with taking into account (27), from the iteration scheme equations we obtain the equation
for d:

p(v)d = g  d  d(v),

where p(v)  (cid:26)d2(v)g  d(v)d(v) + 2hd(v),d(v)i(cid:27).

(28)

7

as has been pointed above, the four-point and three-point functions enter the second-
(x, y, z, t) of

step equations of the iteration scheme. so, for the four-point functions f abcd
the gauge eld, we get the equation

p(v)f(x, y, z, t) = ({g(x  y)1  d(z, t)} +
{y  z,   } + {y  t,   }).

(29)

below we shall work in the transverse gauge d = 0. besides, we restrict ourselves to
the consideration of abelian congurations (23) of the gauge group su(2). for the abelian
congurations it is convenient to introduce the orthogonal basis

uab
0 = nanb, uab

 =

1
2

(ab  nanb  iabcnc).

(30)

in basis (30) it is easy to separate the isotopic structure from the space-time one

d = u0d0

 + u+d + u d,

d = u0d0 + u+d + u d.

for d0

 d0 we get the free propagator equations, that is

d0

 =

1
2 (g 


2 ), d0 =

1
2 .

the equation for d has the form

(31)
here d(v ) =  + igv is the abelian covariant derivative. equation for d is obtained
from (31) by the substitution d  d

, d  d. for d we get the equation:

d(v )d = 1.

(cid:26)d2(v )g  d(v )d(v ) + 2hd(v ),d(v )i(cid:27)d = g  d  d(v ).

(32)

the equation for d is obtained from (32) by the substitution d  d

7 vacuum of abelian congurations and 1/d expan-

sion

as has been pointed in section 3, when considering the nonperturbative modes with v 6= 0
it is necessary to take a superposition of the non-perturbative modes as a candidate for
the physical vacuum | 0 > in order to preserve the poincare-invariance. as the simplest
nontrivial variant for such a superposition, we will consider in the leading approximation a
set of abelian congurations {v } corresponding to abelian solutions (23):

g(0)(j) = x{v }

g(0)
v (j) = x{v}

exp ij  v.

8

the operation p{v } must be chosen in such a manner that all the poincare-non-invariant

contributions would disappear, in particular, the conditions below must be fullled

< 0 | v(x)v(y) | 0 >= 

< 0 | v | 0 >=

1
i

g(0)

j (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)j=0
j(y)j(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)j=0

2g(0)

= 0,

= n  n  f(x  y).

(33)

(34)

it is not dicult to make condition (33) true. for this we notice that for the abelian
congurations v is a solution of the characteristic equation as well as v is, so for
obeying (33) it is sucient to take the superposition g(0)
v (j)  cos j  v, or, in
the general case, p{v } cos j  v. note, that simultaneously the vacuum expectations of
all the odd monomials in v also turn to zero: < 0 | v1    v2n+1 | 0 >= 0. requirement
(34) is less trivial. it is clear that required operation p{v} should be continual, i.e., should
correspond to some integration. but for the calculation of the vacuum expectation itself
there is no necessity to specify this operation, if one is limited to congurations, for which

v (j) + g(0)

v2  v a

 (x)v a

 (x) = v 2 = const,

that are the equal-length congurations 1. really, due to the characteristic equations and
condition (22), the function f(x) must be a solution of the dalambert equation 2f = 0
with the subsidiary condition f = 0 and the initial condition f(0) = v 2. the solution
is unique

f = v 2
d

g.

(35)

similarly, for the four-point monomial we get:

< 0 | v(x)v(y)v(z)v(t) | 0 >=

(v 2)2
d(d + 2)

(gg + gg + gg).

(36)

let us turn to propagators.

it is clear that the solutions of equations (31) and (32)
can not be interpreted as particle propagators in the poincare-invariant theory. physical
propagators must be built by means of the same operations of partial mode superposition:

d(x  y | v 2) = p{v } d(x, y | v).

full solving of eqs. (31) and (32) with consequent transition to the physical vacuum
presents a dicult problem. for its approximate solving notice that, as can be seen from
formulae (34), (35) and (36), in the vacuum of abelian congurations a small parameter
arises, namely, 1/d, where d is the dimension of space-time. it is easy to see that if one takes
d0 = 2 as a leading approximation for equation (31), then after turning to the physical
vacuum all the subsequent terms in the iterative solution d = d0 + d1 +    have a higher
order in the parameter 1/d. slightly bulkier, but not complicated calculation shows that for
d (see eq.(32)) the leading approximation of 1/d-expansion is (2  g2v 2)1   (here
 is a transverse projector).

thus, in the leading order in 1/d, we get in the momentum space

d(p) = d(p) = 

1
p2 + o(1/d),

(37)

1the quantity v 2 plays a role of the order parameter, and its sign must be dened from physical

considerations.

p2 (cid:17) + o(1/d).

(38)

d(p) = d(p) = 

stress once again that, unlike the partial solutions of equations (31)-(32), formulae (37) and
(38) dene the physical propagators of particles in the physical poincare-invariant vacuum.
as is well known, (see, for instance, [6]) in the lattice theories the 1/d-expansion is, in
essence, the mean-eld expansion. probably, as in this instance, the vacuum of abelian
congurations is a peculiar mean-eld approximation to the true physical vacuum.

in the conclusion of this section let us touch on the cluster properties. for the scheme
based on an approximation of the physical vacuum by the superposition of partial modes the
cluster decomposition principle is a nontrivial property (see, for instance, [7]) and requires
checking at each stage of calculations. we can state that this principle is satised for our
model of physical vacuum at least in the leading order of 1/d-expansion. so, for instance,
from eq.(29) we get for the second-step four-point function f of the gauge eld in the
leading order in 1/d: f = d  d + {  } + {  }, which is the usual dis-
connected part of the four-point function, in correspondence with the cluster decomposition
principle.

8 conclusion

in this paper it is found that for non-abelian su(2)-theories with the physical vacuum,
representing a superposition of abelian partial modes, the gauge eld propagator in the
leading approximation of 1/d-expansion is

pp

p2 (cid:17),

(39)

where 2 = g2v 2.

if v 2 > 0 the spectrum contains tachyons which is a sign of instability of this state [1].
at v 2 < 0 this propagator corresponds to the mass spectrum of su(2) georgi-glashow
model [4], and in this case the considered mechanism is a dynamical realization of the
gauge sector for this model. as is well known, this model cannot be incorporated in the
standard model phenomenology. from the viewpoint of our construction it means that
the real physical vacuum of the standard model has a more complicated structure, and
for its description it is necessary to take into account a wider (or other) class of solutions
of the characteristic equations  vacuum constituents of elds. the ensemble of these
solutions is highly extensive and various, and this variety allows one to hope for a possibility
of the dynamical description of the mass generation in the standard model on the base
of principles involved. phenomenological consequences of the dynamical mass generation
in standard model (see, for instance, [8], [9]) lead to the interesting physical results, and
further studying of the dynamical mass generation mechanism seems quite actual.
