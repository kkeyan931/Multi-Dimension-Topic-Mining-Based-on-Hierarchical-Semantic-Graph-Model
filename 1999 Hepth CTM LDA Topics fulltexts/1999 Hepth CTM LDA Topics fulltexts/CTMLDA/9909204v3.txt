eects of fermion-vacuum polarization by a singular conguration of an external static
vector eld are considered in (2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime. expressions for the induced
vacuum charge and magnetic ux are obtained.

1 introduction

eects of singular external elds (zero-range potentials) are comprehensively studied in
quantum mechanics (see [1] and references therein). in this study, we consider the eect of
singular external elds on the fermion vacuum in quantum eld theory.
in contrast to the
schrodinger operator, the dirac operator may be free of an explicit delta-function singularity;
nonetheless, the problem of self-adjoint extension arises in both cases, albeit for dierent reasons
(see, for example [2]). it is well known that a singular magnetic-monopole external eld leads
to a  vacuum violating cp symmetry [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. it will be shown below (see also [8]) that
a singular magnetic-string external eld leads to a  vacuum violating c symmetry.

our analysis will be based on representing the second-quantized fermion-eld operator in

the form

(x, t) =xe>0z

eiete(x)ae +xe<0z

eiete(x)b
e.

(1)

here, the symbol xez denotes summation over the discrete spectrum of the energy e and

integration (with some measure) over its continuum spectrum; a
e and be) are the
fermion (antifermion) creation and annihilation operators satisfying anticommutation relations;
and e(x) is a solution to the equation

e and ae (b

where

he(x) = ee(x),

h = i(cid:20) 

x  iv(x)(cid:21) + m

is the dirac hamiltonian in a static external vector eld v(x). if the condition

zx

[ (h)  (h  )] d = 0,

(2)

(3)

(4)

where d is the volume element of a spatial region x, is met, the hamiltonian h is a hermitian
(symmetric) operator acting in the space of functions dened on x. if, in addition, the spaces
of the functions  and  coincide, the hamiltonian h is a self-adjoint operator.

the integral on the left-hand side of (4) can be reduced to an integral over the surface x

bounding the spatial region x. as a result, relation (4) takes the form

 izx



  d = 0,

(5)

where d is an oriented element of the surface x, the normal to this element being directed
outside the region x.

a standard procedure leads to the expressions for the vacuum-charge density,

(x) = 

and for the vacuum current,

where

performing integration in (6) over the spatial region x, we obtain the total vacuum charge

as to a global quantity associated with vacuum current (7), it follows from the maxwell equation

e2


x  b(i)(x) = j(x)

(9)

(e is the coupling constant) that a magnetic eld is induced in the vacuum. this magnetic eld
is characterized by the eld strength

b(i)(x) = e2z x

x()

j(x)  dx

and by the total ux (in 2 units)

(cid:0)j(x()) = b(i)(x()) = 0(cid:1)

(i) =

2z b(i)  d,

(10)

(11)

where d is an oriented element of the surface orthogonal to the lines of force of the magnetic
eld in the spatial region x.

in this study, we consider a second-quantized fermion eld in an external eld generated by
a source in the form of a singular magnetic string. if we direct the coordinate x3 axis along the
string, the strength of the string magnetic eld is given by

b3(x) = 2(0)(x).

(12)

by x, we will henceforth mean a two-dimensional vector in the plane orthogonal to the string
axis [x = (x1, x2)] ; the parameter (0) is the total magnetic ux (in 2 units) of a string. it is
natural to choose the gauge

v3 = 0.

2

(13)

the two-dimensional vector potential v = (v1, v2) can then be dened as

x  v(x) = 0, x  v(x) = (0).

(14)

that the potential v(x) is indeterminate at the point x = 0 of the plane is associated with the
delta-function singularity in the strength b3 (12) at this point. on the plane orthogonal to the
string axis, the dirac hamiltonian has the form

h = irr  ir1(  i(0)) + m,

where

r = 1 cos  + 2 sin ,  = 1 sin  + 2 cos ,

and where we introduced the polar coordinates

(16)

r = [(x1)2 + (x2)2]

2 ,  = arctan(cid:18) x2
x1(cid:19) .

this article is organized as follows.

in section 2, we determine the complete system of
solutions to the dirac equation in the eld of a singular magnetic string.
in section 3, we
consider the vacuum charge induced on the plane orthogonal to the string axis. in section 4,
we analyze the vacuum magnetic ux through this plane. the results obtained in this study
are discussed in section 5. some technical details concerning the derivation of basic relations
are described in appendices a and b.

2 solving the dirac equation in the eld of a singular

magnetic string

it is well known that, in (2 + 1)-dimensional space-time, the cliord algebra does not have a
faithful irreducible representation; instead, it has two nonequivalent irreducible representations.
accordingly, the matrices 1, 2 and  admit the following realizations in terms of square rank-
two matrices:

(17)

1 = 2,

 = 3,

2 = s1,

s = 1.

here, 1, 2 and 3 are the pauli matrices, and the two possible values of the parameter s
correspond to the two nonequivalent representations.

a solution to the time-independent dirac equation (2) with the hamiltonian h in the form

(15) is given by

where

e(x) = xnz

< x|e, n >,

< x|e, n >=(cid:18) fn(r, e)ein

gn(r, e)ei(n+s) (cid:19) ,

(18)

(19)

and z is the set of integers. the radial wave functions fn and gn satisfy the system of equations

(r + r1s)fn = (e + m)gn,

[r + r1(s + 1)]gn = (e  m)fn,

(20)

3

where  = n (0). in the case of (0) 6= n (where n  z), two linearly independent solutions
to (20) that correspond to the continuous spectrum, |e| > |m|, 1) can be represented as

(cid:18) fn

gn

()(r, e)

()(r, e) (cid:19) =(cid:18)

f (0)(e)js(kr)

g(0)(e)j(s+1)(kr) (cid:19) ,

where k = e2  m2, and j(z) is the bessel function of order . it can be seen from (21) that

a solution that is regular at the point r = 0 can be chosen for all modes with the exception of
that which corresponds to n = n0, where n0 is determined from the condition

 1 < s0 < 0.

(22)

for this mode, either the upper or the lower component of the spinor in (19)  depending on
the choice of the plus or minus sign in (21)  proves to be irregular at r = 0, although it is
it is also obvious that, for (0) = n (where n  z)), a solution that is
square-integrable.
regular at the point r = 0 can be chosen for all modes. let us introduce the quantity

(21)

(23)

f =

1
2

+ s(cid:16){| (0)|} 

1

2(cid:17).

here, {| u|} stands for the fractional part of the quantity u  that is {| u|} = u  [[u]]
(0  {| u|} < 1), where [[u]] is the integral part of u (the closest integer to u from below or the
integer equal to u if it is integral itself). taking into account the relations

n0 = [[(0)]] +

1) it should be noted that, in (2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime, as well as in any spacetime having an odd
number of dimensions, the parameter m appearing in expression (3) tor the hamiltonian can take both positive
and negative values.

for the irregular mode (s = s0). the parameter  is determined by the requirement that
hamiltonian (15) be a self-adjoint operator. we are now going to consider this issue in some
detail.

in the case being considered, the condition requiring that hamiltonian be a hermitian

operator (5) takes the form

h2r xnz

r=

r=0

( fngn  gnfn)i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= 0.

(29)

if the modes corresponding to n 6= n0 are subjected to the regularity condition at r = 0,
hamiltonian (15) as dened on the space of these modes becomes a self-adjoint operator. the
mode with n = n0 cannot be subjected to the regularity condition, because we would then be
obliged to discard solution (28), thereby spoiling the completeness of the set of solutions to
the dirac equation. thus, there arises the problem of determining the boundary condition for
the irregular mode at r = 0  in other words, the problem of the self-adjoint extension of a
hermitian operator (precisely for this mode). this problem is solved with the aid of the weyl-
von neumann theory of self-adjoint operators (see, for example, [1, 9]). since the defect index
of the operator dened on the space of regular functions is (1, 1) in the case being considered,
the self-adjoint extension represents a set of operators that is parametrized with the aid of one
real continuous variable (), and the required boundary condition for the irregular mode has
the form 2)

substituting the asymptotic form of solution (28) for r  0 into (30), we arrive at

and (z) is the euler gamma function. formulas (31) and (32) establish the relation between
the parameters  and . the boundary condition (30) results in that the spectrum involves
not only a continuum but also the bound state

it is obvious that there is no bound state for

0 < a(f, ) < 

and that there arises a bound state for

the bound-state energy is zero, ebs = 0, at

  < a(f, ) < 0.

we also have

a(f, ) = 1.

sgn(ebs) = sgn(m)
sgn(ebs) = sgn(m)

, 1 < a(f, ) < 0.

thus, we have constructed the complete system of solutions to the dirac equation in the
eld of a singular magnetic string. it should be noted that for the case in which s = 1, m > 0
and e > 0, the results presented in this section were rst obtained in [10].

3 induced vacuum charge

by using the explicit form of solutions to the dirac equation, we can nd the vacuum-charge

density averaged over all directions. we have

(r) =

1

2z 2

0

d(x),

(40)

where (x) is determined by relation (6).

for the contribution of the regular modes (26) and (27) to the averaged vacuum charge (r)

(40), we obtain

reg(r) = 

1

8 z 

0

+(e  m)[j 2

l+1f (kr) + j 2



xl=1n(e + m)[j 2

dkk xsgn(e)

|e|1
l1+f (kr)]o,

lf (kr) + j 2

l+f (kr)] +

(41)

where we combined summation over l and l. in general, the correct procedure should involve
introducing the regularizing factor |e|t(t > 0) in (41) and going over to the limit t  0+ upon
performing summation and integration. however, the nal result remains unchanged if, instead
of introducing a regularizing factor, we perform rst summation over the sign of the energy and
then integration with respect to k, the integral of the contribution of each modes in (26) and
(27) with respect to k being convergent and integration with respect to k being commutative
with summation over l. in our subsequent calculations, summation performed rst over the
sign of the energy and then over l is followed by integration with respect to k.

summation over the sign of energy and over l in (41) yields

reg(r) =

k2 + m2

[j 2

(42)

with the aid of the relation

k2 + m2

=

2

 z 

0

du

1

k2 + m2 + u2

,

we can perform integration with respect to k. following the substitution u = pq2  m2, we

eventually obtain

reg(r) =

[i1f (qr)k1f (qr)  if (qr)kf (qr)],

(43)

where i(z) is the modied bessel function of order . the expression coincident with (43) is
obtained by deforming the contour of integration in the complex plane (see appendix a).

an alternative representation of the contribution of the regular modes to the averaged

vacuum-charge density has the form

reg(r) = 

m r1

(2)

ds exp(s2

du exp[u2(k2 + m2)].

taking into account (33)-(39), we nd that the contribution of the bound state is

it should be emphasized once again that relations (49) and (50) hold only in the case of
nonintegral values of the string ux (0 < f < 1). for integral values of the string ux (f = 0),
the density and the ux vanish because all square-integrable modes are then regular for r  0,
and the latter case does not dier in the least from the string-free case ((0) = 0).

from relations (53) and (54), it can be seen that the vacuum charge as a function of the string
ux undergoes discontinuities at integral values of its argument.

this is conrmed in the case of  =

by using the explicit form of solutions to the dirac equation, we can nd the vacuum current

averaged over all directions. we have

j(r) =

2z 2

0

d j(x),

(58)

where j(x) is given by (7). having veried that the radial component of the vacuum current
vanishes, jr(r) = 0, we proceed to considering the angular component j(r).

for the contribution of the regular modes (26) and (27) to j(r), we obtain

(60)
in the same way as that used to evaluate the contribution of the regular modes to the averaged
vacuum-charge density, the integral in (60) can be reduced to an integral featuring modied
bessel functions in the corresponding integral. the result has the form

it should be emphasized that, in contrast to the vacuum charge, the vacuum magnetic ux is

5 discussion of results

it has been shown that, on the plane orthogonal to the singular magnetic string specied by
(12), the fermion vacuum is characterized by the quantum numbers (52), (57), and (67), which
depend on the parameter  of self-adjoint extension. in relation to the  vacuum for the case
of a monopole [3, 4, 5, 6, 7], the  vacuum for the case of a string possesses a richer structure
[dependence on (0), s and sgn(m))]. in all probability, this is due to a nontrivial topology of
the base space in the latter case: 1 = 0 in the case of a space with a punctured point, and
1 = z in the case with a removed line (or in the case of a plane with a punctured point),
where 1 is the rst homotopic group. it should be noted that the vacuum charge changes sign
and the vacuum magnetic ux remains unchanged under either of the substitutions s  s
and m  m.
let us compare expressions (52) and (57) obtained here for the vacuum charge with the
expression for the vacuum charge induced by a regular conguration of an external magnetic
eld. in the latter case, one has [12]

q(i) = 

1
2

s sgn(m) ,

 =

1

2z d2x b3(x),

(70)

where b3(x) is a function that is continuous everywhere with the exception of integrable singu-
larities at isolated points or on isolated lines. in contrast to (70), expressions (52) and (57) are
periodic in the ux of an external magnetic eld. this can be considered as a manifestation of
the aharonov-bohm eect [13] in quantum eld theory (see [14]). since it is sometimes stated
that the vacuum charge is not periodic in (0) (see, for example, [15, 16]), we will dwell on this
point at greater length.

under charge conjugation,

c : v  v,   1,

(71)

the charge operator and its vacuum expectation value, as well as the vacuum magnetic ux,
must change sign, but this is not the case for expressions (52), (57), and (67), because the
boundary condition (30) violates charge-conjugation symmetry. however, for a specic choice
of the parameter , this symmetry can be conserved.

in particular, the choice of

 = s 
 = s 

2 (mod 2),

s(0) > 0

2 (mod 2), s(0) < 0 (cid:27) ((0) 6= n, n  z),

(72)

11

which corresponds to the boundary condition considered in [17, 18], leads to the expression
(compare with the results presented in [15, 16])

q(i) =(cid:26)  1

2 s sgn(m){| (0)|},
2 s sgn(m)(1  {| (0)|}), (0) < 0 (cid:27) ,

(0) > 0

1

{| (0)|} 6= 0.

(73)

this result changes sign under change conjugation, but it is not periodic in (0).

the parameter  can be chosen in such a way as to conserve both periodicity in (0) and

the discrete symmetry (71). this can be achieved, for example, by setting

 = s 
2 (mod 2),
 = 0 (mod 2),
 = s 

 1
2 < s({| (0)|}  1
{| (0)|} = 1
2 (mod 2), 0 < s({| (0)|}  1

2

2) < 0

2) < 1

2

,

(74)

which corresponds to the condition of minimal irregularity, i.e., to a radial wave function that
diverges for r  0 no faster than rp, where p  1
2. it is with this boundary condition that the
result reported in [14] is recovered in the form

q(i) =

1
2

s sgn(m)(cid:20)1

2

sgn0({| (0)|} 

1
2

)  {| (0)|} +

1

2(cid:21) ,

(75)

where

sgn0(u) =(cid:26) sgn(u), u 6= 0

u = 0

0,

.

it should be noted that expression (75) is continuous for integral values of the string ux and
displays discontinuities at half-integer values.

another choice of  that is also compatible both with periodicity in (0) and with symmetry

(71) is

we then arrive at the expression

 = 0 (mod 2),

0 < {| (0)|} < 1.

q(i) = 

1
2

s sgn(m)(cid:20) 1

) + {| (0)|} 

1

2(cid:21) ,

(76)

(77)

which is discontinuous both at integral and half-integer values of the string ux.

when the boundary condition (72) is used, expression (67) for the vacuum magnetic ux

takes the form (see also [15])

(i) =(  e2

12|m|{| (0)|}(1  {| (0)|}
12|m| (1  {| (0)|})[1  (1  {| (0)|})

),

], (0) < 0

we also have

expressions (79) and (80) are odd under charge conjugation and are periodic in the string

c symmetry and periodicity in the string ux is given by

naturally, the same expression is obtained if the branch for fractional exponents is chosen
alternatively as

0 <  < 1.

(a.13)

with the aid of relations (35)-(39), expression (a.12) is reduced to the form coincident with
that of the last term in (48).

it should be also noted that the above method can be used to reduce expression (42)
to the form (43), in which case the integrand naturally does not have poles on the segment
m2 < k2 < 0.

the contribution of the irregular mode to the averaged vacuum current can be found by a
method that is similar to that used to calculate the contribution of this mode to the averaged
density of the vacuum charge. in the case being considered, the function f () has the form
