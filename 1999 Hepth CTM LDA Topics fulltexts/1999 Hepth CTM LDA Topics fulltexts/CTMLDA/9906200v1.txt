we study d-branes on the quintic cy by combining results from several directions: general

results on holomorphic curves and vector bundles, stringy geometry and mirror symmetry,

and the boundary states in gepner models recently constructed by recknagel and schome-

rus, to begin sketching a picture of d-branes in the stringy regime. we also make rst

steps towards computing superpotentials on the d-brane world-volumes.

1. introduction

in this work we study d-branes on the quintic calabi-yau, historically the rst cy

to be intensively studied. our guiding question will be: to classify all supersymmetry-

preserving d-branes at each point in cy moduli space, and nd their world-volume moduli

spaces. as is well known, results of this type are quite relevant for phenomenological

applications of m/string theory, because the world-volume theories we will obtain include
a wide variety of four-dimensional theories with n = 1 space-time supersymmetry. the
problem includes the classication of holomorphic vector bundles (which are ground states

for wrapped six-branes); and almost all m/string compactications which lead to d = 4,
n = 1 supersymmetry (such as (0, 2) heterotic string compactications and f theory
constructions) have a choice of bundle as one of the inputs. thus, many works have

addressed this subject explicitly or implicitly.

as usual in string compactication this geometric data is only an input and one would

really like to answer the same questions with stringy corrections included. the primary

question along these lines is: is the eect of stringy corrections just quantitative  aecting

masses and couplings in the eective lagrangian but preserving the spectrum and moduli

spaces  or is it qualitative? if the latter, we might imagine that that geometric branes

undergo radical changes of their moduli space or are even destabilized in the stringy regime,

with new branes which were unstable in the large volume limit taking their place. it should

be realized that at present very little is known about this question; for example it has not

been ruled out that the d0-brane becomes unstable in the stringy regime or has moduli

space dimension dierent from 3.

clearly these questions are of great importance for the string phenomenology men-

tioned above and were asked long ago in the context of (0, 2) models. no simple answer

has been proposed; we will return to this in the conclusions.

a concrete framework which allows an exact cft study of the stringy regime is

provided by the gepner models. the main lesson from the original study of gepner models

for type ii and heterotic strings was that these cft compactications are continuously

connected to cy compactication. mirror symmetry is manifest in the 2d superconformal

eld theory, and this connection was one of the earliest arguments for it in the cy context.

the rst detailed study of d-branes in gepner models was made by recknagel and

schomerus [7] who (following the general approach of cardy) constructed a large set of

examples; further work appears in [8,9]. so far no geometric interpretation or contact with

1

the large volume limit has been made. we will do so in this work. the main tool we will

use is the (symplectic) intersection form for three-cycles in the large volume limit. this

form governs dirac quantization in the eective d = 4 theory and as such must be invariant
under any variation of the moduli. as argued in [10,11] it is given by the index tr ab(1)f
in open string cft and thus is easily computed for the gepner boundary states. the

detailed study of kahler moduli space by candelas et. al. [12] then allows relating this to

the large volume basis for 2p-branes. we can also make the large volume identication for

the 3-branes, aided by the large discrete symmetry group.

the detailed outline of the paper is as follows. in section 2 we review the quintic, its

homology and moduli space, and give a general overview of d-branes on the quintic in the

large volume limit. in section 3 we review the stringy geometry of its kahler moduli space

and the monodromy group acting on b branes.

in section 4 we review gepner models

and cardys theory of boundary states, which will allow us to review the boundary states

constructed by recknagel and schomerus. we briey discuss the theory for k3 compacti-

cations, and show that the results agree with geometric expectations; in particular that

the dimension of a brane moduli space on k3 is given by the mukai formula. in section

5 we compute the large volume charges for the quintic boundary states, and compute the

number of marginal operators. this will allow us to propose candidate geometric identi-

cations. in section 6 we discuss the computation of world-volume superpotentials. we

begin by presenting evidence that the superpotential is topological in a sense that we

explain. if true, an important consequence would be that the superpotential for b-type

branes has relatively trivial kahler dependence and can thus be computed in the large

volume limit. this would imply general agreement between stringy and geometric results,

analogous to the case of the prepotential. in section 7 we discuss superpotential compu-

tations in the gepner model and derive selection rules. besides charge conservation rules

similar to those in the closed string sector, additional boundary selection rules appear, and

we illustrate these with the examples of the a1 and a2 minimal models. the selection
rules will allow us to establish that certain branes have non-trivial moduli spaces. the

exact superpotentials should be calculable given the solutions of the consistency conditions

of boundary cft [13,14]; this is work in progress. in section 8 we summarize our results

and draw conclusions.

a point of notation:

in labelling a p-brane, we always ignore its minkowski space-

lling dimensions (for example, a d4 wraps four dimensions of the cy), but we describe

its world-volume lagrangian in d = 4, n = 1 terms (appropriate if the brane lled all 3 + 1

minkowski dimensions).

2. large volume limit of the quintic

2.1. general discussion of d-branes on large volume cy

we are interested in bps states in type ii string theory described by collections of d-

branes at points on or wrapping some cycle in a calabi-yau manifold m . a conguration

for n coincident d-branes with worldvolume  wrapped on such a cycle is specied by an
embedding x :   m and a u (n ) gauge eld a on , with eld strength f = da+[a, a].
the u (1) part of u (n ) appears in combination with the b-eld, f = f  xb, where
xb is the pullback of the ns b-eld onto the worldvolume.

the conditions for supersymmetric embeddings with nonabelian elds turned on has

not been given, but they have been worked out for single d-branes in refs. [3][15], for which

the action of spacetime supersymmetry and worldvolume -symmetry is known [16]. a
compactication preserving supersymmetry will occur if there are constant spinors i on
m for each of the spacetime susys. these supersymmetries transform the embedding

coordinates (and their superpartners) on the d-brane worldvolumes; they are preserved if

one can nd a -symmetry transformation which cancels the susy transformation. this

condition can be written as

(1  )i = 0

(2.1)

and those i which are solutions form the unbroken susys.  is dened as follows [15].
let em
 be the vielbein connecting frame indices m and spacetime indices . we can pull
this back to the worldvolume, dening

em

 = x em

where  is a worldvolume index for the p-brane. with this we can pull back the 10d

-matrices m:

when f = 0 this can be written in the simpler, more familiar form:

 = 1...p+1 1 x 1 . . . p+1x p+1 1 . . . p+1

(2.7)

where  = em
 m. the conditions in this latter case have been worked out in some detail,
as we will describe below. these conditions match those in refs. [17][18] for boundary states

of bps d-branes in at space with constant background elds.

solutions to eq. (2.1) in the presence of nonzero f have been worked out for at,
intersecting branes in refs. [17][18][15]. in the case of bps d-branes in calabi-yau 3-fold

compactications the geometric conditions implied by (2.1) (and the analog for boundary

states) have been worked out in [3][6]. these solutions fall into two classes: a-type branes

wrapping special lagrangian submanifolds and b-type branes wrapping holomorphic

cycles. let us describe each of these in turn.

2.1.1. b branes

b-type bps branes wrap even-dimensional, holomorphic cycles in the calabi-yau

[3][6]. for b (even-dimensional) branes, (2.1) is solved by holomorphically embedded

curves (2-branes) and surfaces (4-branes), as well as by 0 and 6-branes with the obvious

(trivial) embeddings. we may also have gauge elds on these branes. in general the gauge

eld may change the denition of a supersymmetric cycle via eq. (2.1). however, if the

brane is wrapped around a holomorphic cycle, we can nd conditions for the gauge eld

to preserve the supersymmetries.

in the case of n coincident d6-branes wrapping the

entire cy threefold, if we assume that the gauge elds live only in the threefold then the

susy-preserving gauge eld must satisfy the hermitian yang-mills equations [19]:

fij = 0

2  tr f = c3 ,

(2.8)

where (i, j) and i,  are holomorphic and antiholomorphic indices, respectively, on the cy.
these equations dene a hermitian-einstein connection a with curvature f . the rst

equation tells us that the vector bundle is holomorphic. the second equation tells us

that the vector bundle is -stable; conversely, -stability guarantees a solution to these

equations [20] (c.f. chapter 4 of [21] for a discussion and denitions.)

for branes wrapped around holomorphic submanifolds of m , these equations must

be altered. the gauge elds polarized transverse to the cycle are replaced by twisted

4

scalars  which are one-forms in the normal bundle to the embedding [4], and eq. (2.8)

becomes a generalization of the hitchin equations for  and f [19].

it is believed that all topological invariants of a d-brane conguration are given by an

element of a particular k-theory group on m [22][23]. when the k-theory group and/or

the cohomology of m has torsion the k-theory interpretation is important; one may have

objects charged under the torsion. the charge can be written [22] as a generalization of

the results of [24][25]:

v(e) = ch(f!e)q a(m )

(2.9)

here e is a vector bundle on ; remember that we must extend the u (1) part of the
gauge eld f by the ns b-eld, so properly the vector bundle e is a polynomial in f .
let  : m   be the projection onto the worldvolume and n be the normal bundle
of   m . there is a k-theory element (n ) which is roughly a delta function on the
worldvolume and depends on n ; we can thus dene f!(e) = e  (n ). the moduli
space of d-branes will not just be the moduli space of vector bundles in this k-theory class

but rather the moduli space of coherent semistable sheaves in this class [26][19]. some

advantages of this denition through k-theory and sheaves, besides the fact that it seems

to be correct, are that it places congurations with d6-branes (gauge eld congurations

on m ) on an equal footing with congurations without d6-branes, and that it can describe

certain singularities which lead to sensible string compactications.

in examples without torsion, such as the quintic, one may describe the d-brane charge

in a less esoteric fashion. assuming the branes give rise to particles in the macroscopic

directions, for a 2n-dimensional worldvolume  we can write the d-brane coupling to the

rr gauge elds via the wess-zumino term as [27,24,25]:

where

c  ch(f  b)s a(m )

a(n )

z

c = c(2n+1) + c(2n1) + . . . + c(1)

(2.10)

is a sum over the (k)-form rr potentials that couple to the 2n-brane.

these rr charges reduce to conventional electric and magnetic charges in the four

noncompact dimensions. given two d-branes which reduce to particles, the most basic

observable we can study is the dirac-schwinger-zwanziger symplectic inner product on

their charges,

i(a, b) = qea  qm b  qm a  qeb .

(2.11)

5

we will refer to this as the intersection form as it is closely related to the topological

intersection form for two- and four-branes. for two six-branes, from the formulas above it

is

i(a, b) =z ch(fa) ch(fb) a(m ) .

(2.12)

finally, we quote a general theorem regarding stability (bogomolovs inequality [28];

c.f. [29,21]): given a variety x of dimension n and  an ample divisor on x, then a

-semistable torsion free sheaf e of rank r and chern classes ci will satisfy

zs(cid:0)2r c2  (r  1)c2

1(cid:1)  n2  0 .

(2.13)

the parenthesized combination is called the discriminant of the sheaf and is equal to
c2(end(e)). in the special case c1(e) = 0 this amounts to requiring c2(e)  0.

2.1.2. a branes

a-type bps branes wrap three-dimensional special lagrangian submanifolds [3]1:

| = 0
reei| = 0 .

(2.14)

here  is the holomorphic 3-form of the calabi-yau and  is an arbitrary phase. equiv-

alently to the second equation, we can require that  pulls back to a constant multiple

of the volume element on . furthermore the gauge eld on this manifold must be at.

a nice introduction to the general theory of these is [31]. it is shown there (and in the
references therein) that the moduli space has complex dimension b1(). the space of at
u (1) connections has real dimension b1(), and ij can be used to get an isomorphism
between t  and n ; thus the deformations of  pair up with the wilson lines to form
b1() complex moduli.

for three-branes, the dsz inner product (2.11) is precisely the geometric intersection

form.

one application of these branes is the strominger-yau-zaslow formulation of mirror

symmetry, a precise formulation of the idea that mirror symmetry is t-duality [32].

since mirror symmetry exchanges the sets of a and b branes, an appropriately chosen

1 there is some evidence that the special lagrangian condition receives  corrections [30].

6

moduli space of a branes on m will be the moduli space of d0-branes on the mirror w .
clearly b1 = 3 for such a-branes, and syz argue that  will be a t 3 in this case.

another application is the construction of n = 1 gauge theories with the help of brane

congurations. supersymmetric three-cycles have been used to explore the strong coupling

limit by lifting the brane congurations to m-theory in [33].

not too many explicit constructions of special lagrangian submanifolds are known

and it appears (e.g. see [31]) that the problem is of the same order of diculty as writing

explicit ricci-at metrics on a cy. a general construction we will use below is as the xed

point set of a real involution.

2.2. general world-volume considerations

given a system x of a or b d-branes, we can consider the system which is identical

except that it extends in the at 3 +1 dimensions transverse to m . this system will have a
d = 4, n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory as its low-energy world-volume theory, whose
data is a gauge group gx ; a complex manifold cx parameterized by chiral superelds i; a
kahler potential k on cx ; an action by holomorphic isometries of gx on cx (linearizing
around a solution this corresponds to the usual choice of representation r of the gauge

group), and a superpotential w (a holomorphic function on cx invariant under the action
of gx ). if gx contains u (1) factors, each of these can have an associated real constant
a (the fayet-iliopoulos terms).

in the classical (gs  0) limit, the moduli space of this theory is the solutions of fi =
w/i = 0 (the f-terms) and da =  a (the d-terms) modulo gauge transformations,
where da is the moment map generating the associated gauge transformation (and  a  0
in the non-abelian parts of the gauge group).

we review this well-known material for a number of reasons. first, we remind the

reader that although some of our later discussion will use other realizations of this d-brane

system (for example as particles in 3 + 1 dimensions), the world-volume theories for these

other realizations are all obtained by naive dimensional reduction from the 3 + 1 theory
(if gs  0), while the 3 + 1 language makes it easy to impose supersymmetry.

second, it is known that the study of bundles and sheaves on cy three-folds is much

more complicated than that for k3; this complication has a direct physical counterpart in
the reduced constraints of n = 1 supersymmetry. the most basic example of this is the
fact that  unlike the case for k3  there is no formula for the dimension of the moduli

space of e given c(e). the main reason for this is that this dimension is not necessarily

7

constant  the moduli space can have branches of dierent dimension, and can depend on

the moduli of the cy as well.

physically, this corresponds to the possibility of a fairly arbitrary superpotential in the
low energy theory. indeed, the language of superpotentials and n = 1 eective lagrangians
might be the best one for these problems, much as hyperkahler geometry and hyperkahler

quotient is for instanton problems in four dimensions. just as the self-dual yang-mills

equations can be regarded as an innite-dimensional hyperkahler quotient, we might pose

the problem of rephrasing the ym equations under discussion as the problem of nding
the moduli space of an n = 1 eective theory with an innite number of elds.

the basic outlines of part of this treatment are known (see [34], ch. 6 for a very clear

discussion of the four-dimensional case). the two equations (2.8) will correspond directly

to the f-term (superpotential) constraints and the d-term constraints, respectively. in-

deed, the problem of solving fij = 0 is a purely holomorphic problem, while it is not hard
to see that the expression f a  n1 is the moment map generating conventional gauge
transformations. the stability condition on the bundle is exactly the innite-dimensional

counterpart of the usual condition in supersymmetric gauge theory for an orbit of the

complexied gauge group to contain a solution of the d-atness conditions (e.g. see [35]).

donaldsons theorem proving the existence of such solutions proceeds exactly by consid-

ering the ow generated by i times the moment map to a minimum; the uhlenbeck-yau

generalization is quite similar (for technical reasons a dierent equation is used).

the other part of the story  translating the problem of nding holomorphic vector

bundles into solving constraints on a nite-dimensional conguration space, which can be

derived from a superpotential  does not seem to have been addressed in as systematic a

manner; clearly this could be useful.

in a sense the six-dimensional problem is the universal one which also describes the

lower-dimensional branes. not only can their charges be reproduced, but gauge eld sin-

gularities will correspond to specic lower dimensional branes (e.g. the small instanton).

furthermore, there is a sense in which even the lower-dimensional brane world-volume

theories are six-dimensional if we include winding strings (by analogy to tori and orb-

ifolds, although this idea has not yet been made precise). treating a system of n d0s as

quantum mechanics requires neglecting these strings, which one expects to be problematic

once the separation between branes approaches the size of the space.

we now turn from these abstract ideas to our concrete example.

8

2.3. d-branes on the quintic

perhaps the best-studied family of calabi-yau manifolds is the quintic hypersurfaces
in ip4. a relatively thorough discussion of these is contained in the classic paper [12]. the

moduli space of these manifolds is locally the product of b2,1 = 101 complex structure

deformations and b1,1 = 1 deformations of the complexied kahler forms b + ij (where b

is the ux of the ns-ns b-eld). we will be particularly interested in the fermat quintic

p =

5xi=1

z5
i = 0

(2.15)

where zi are the homogenous coordinates on ip4. note that this equation has a s5  z4
5
discrete symmetry; the z5 generators are gi : zi  zi and satisfy the relationq5
i=1 gi = 1,

while the s5 permutes the coordinates in the obvious way.

2.3.1. b branes on the quintic

as we have discussed, d-branes on the quintic can be described by vector bundles or

sheaves on this space. let us denote the charge carried by a single d2p-brane wrapped
about a generator of h 2p as q2p = 1.

transporting a d-brane conguration about closed, nontrivial cycles of the moduli

space of kahler structures will induce an associated sp(4, z) monodromy on the b branes.

we will discuss the monodromy more completely in the next section, but there is already
one cycle in the moduli space which can be understood in the large volume limit: b  b +
1, where b is the ns 2-form. the action on the charge q can be seen from eqs. (2.9),(2.10)

[36]. mathematically this corresponds to the possibility to tensor the vector bundle v2p

with a u (1) bundle of c1 = 1. this preserves stability and the dimension of the moduli

space. given a bundle v this operation and its inverse can be used to produce a related
bundle with r < c1  0: this is referred to as a normalized vector bundle.

there is no classication of vector bundles and coherent sheaves on the quintic, but

we can write down a few examples in order to orient ourselves when discussing specic

boundary states at the gepner point.

bps d2-branes wrap holomorphic 2-cycles of the calabi-yau, the same cycles as

appear in worldsheet instanton corrections. such cycles can have arbitrary genus and

arbitrary degree. degree one rational curves are generically rigid on the quintic [37].

9

nontheless for special quintics, families may exist; for example, in the case of the fermat

quintic (2.15), there is a two-parameter family described by [38]:

(z1, z2, z3, z4, z5) = (u, u, av, bv, cv)
a5 + b5 + c5 = 0;

a, b, c  c ,

(2.16)

where (u, v) are homogeneous coordinates in ip1. once we perturb away from the fermat
point, these moduli must be lifted. this could be described in the world-volume theory by

a superpotential of the general form

w = 2

where  are complex structure moduli;  = 0 is the fermat point;  are curve moduli, and

 = 0 a curve which exists for generic quintics.

the innitesimal description of deformations of such cycles is as sections of the normal
bundle, which by the calabi-yau condition will be o(a)o(b) with a+b = 2 for a rational
curve. one might think that all one needs to nd examples of families is to nd examples
with a  0 or b  0, but this is not true as deformations can be obstructed. the canonical
example is given by resolving the singularity in c4

xy = z2  t2n .

(2.17)

for n = 1 this is the conifold singularity and the small resolution contains a rigid ip1,
parameterized by x/(z  t) = (z + t)/y. it can be shown [39] that for n > 1 the resolution
also contains a ip1, now with normal bundle o  o(2), but the deformation is obstructed
at nth order, as could be described by the superpotential

w = n+1.

(2.18)

intuitively this can be seen by deforming (2.17) by a generic polynomial in t2, which splits
the singularity into n conifold singularities, each admitting a rigid ip1. if we then tune
the parameters to make these ip1s coincide, a superpotential describing the n vacua will
degenerate to (2.18). such singularities do appear in large families of quintic cys [37].

higher genus curves can generically come in families and examples can be found as
complete intersections of hypersurfaces in ip4 with the quintic. a particular example is
the intersection of two hyperplanes with the quintic [38]:

akzk =

5xk=1

5xk=1

bkzk = 0 , ak, bk  c .

(2.19)

10

it is easy to see that there are six independent complex parameters after rescaling the

equations. the curve is genus 6, and the area of the curve c isrc j = 5, where j is the

unit normalized kahler form of ip4, i.e.

zip4
zquintic

j  j  j  j = 1

j  j  j = 5

(2.20)

thus this brane has q2 = 5.2 there will be six additional complex moduli coming from
wilson lines of the u (1) gauge eld around the 12 cycles of the curve.

similarly, four-branes can be obtained as the intersection with another hypersurface

in ip4. for example, the intersection of the quintic with a single hyperplane

akzk = 0

xk

produces a four-parameter family of four-cycles s. their volume isrs j = 5 and so q4 = 5.

in addition c2(t s) = 11j 2; so that the coupling of c(1) to p1/48 in eqs. (2.9),(2.10) leads
to an induced 0-brane charge of 55/24. the four-brane generically may support nontrivial

gauge eld ux over two-cycles, corresponding to d2-brane charge, or instanton solutions,

corresponding to zero-brane charge. some discussion of the moduli space of four-branes

in a calabi-yau can be found in [41]. by (2.13), stability of the vector bundle on the

four-brane requires q0 > 0.

finally we can look at the case of d6-branes wrapping the entire calabi-yau manifold.

in fact we will nd that all of the boundary states we examine at the gepner point will have

non-trivial six-brane charge. a single six-brane by itself will have no moduli. the u (1)

gauge eld on a single 6-brane can support ux with rst chern class c1 = n corresponding
to q4 = n. we can get the relevant bundles by restriction from u (1) bundles on ip4. the
latter have no moduli, and we will not gain any upon restriction.

we can also imagine binding d2-branes to the d6-brane, by analogy to 2  6 (or
0  4) congurations in at space. for q6 = 1 and q4 = 0 this appears singular; u (1)
gauge elds do not support smooth instanton solutions. the brane counterpart to this is
that the 2  6 strings cannot be given vevs which bind the branes and give mass to the
[40], chapters 1 and 2 for a nice description of complete intersections in projective

spaces, and of techniques for performing the calculations we allude to here.

11

relative u (1)s. this might lead us to predict that such states, if they exist at all, exist only

as quantum-mechanical bound states. such a state should be easily identiable because

it appears at the junction of coulomb and higgs branches of the moduli space; a small

perturbation should put it on the coulomb branch and produce two u (1) gauge elds in

the macroscopic direction. in the classical considerations of this paper, it should not show

up at all.

for q6 > 1, we require information about vector bundles on the calabi-yau. a well-

known example with q6 = 3 is deformations of the tangent bundle. this has vanishing

c1 and c2(e) = 10j giving us q2 = 50. the dimension of the moduli space is 224. this

example can be generalized as follows. (such generalizations are due to for example [42,43]

in the physics literature, and were previously known as monads in the math literature).

we consider a complex of holomorphic vector bundles

0  a a b b c  0

such that ker a = 0, im a is a subbundle of b, im b = c and dene our new bundle as

e = ker b/im a.

for a hypersurface m in ipn, simple bundles to start with are direct sums of the line
bundles o(n) restricted to m , as in

0  o  m

i=1o(qi)  o(

mxi=1

qi)  0

this data allows computing the chern classes:

cn = (

mxi=1

qi)n 

qn
i .

mxi=1

the dimension of the moduli space can also be computed, but this is not as easy.

a physical realization of this construction is to start with elds i parameterizing

sections of b (e.g. the world-sheet fermions of a heterotic string theory), include a super-
potential enforcing the constraints ba
i i = 0, and gauge invariances identifying i  i +ai.
although it is not the only place this construction appears (e.g. see [44]), the most relevant

version for present purposes is in linear (0, 2) models [43]. these constructions have the

advantage that they can be studied with conventional world-sheet techniques; a disadvan-

tage is that one requires the anomaly cancellation conditions c1 = 0 and c2(v ) = c2(t ) to
get a sensible model, so only a subset of possible v can be obtained.

the anomaly cancellation conditions also appear in d-brane constructions of the dual

type i theories as the consistency condition that the total rr charge vanishes [45]. however

in this context we need not consider branes which ll the noncompact dimensions but can

instead consider lower dimensional branes, for which these consistency conditions are not

required (a point emphasized in [5]). it seems likely that this additional freedom will lead

to a simpler theory.

another construction of vector bundles on a cy is the serre construction. given a

holomorphic curve (satisfying certain conditions), this produces a rank 2 vector bundle

with a section having its zeroes on the curve. in [46] this is used to produce an example

of a vector bundle with an obstructed deformation (on a dierent cicy).

finally, to conclude this section, there are a few explicit constructions of bundles on
ip4 in the literature using monads, such as the horrocks-mumford bundle (r = 2, c1 =
5, c2 = 10) and the bundle of tango (r = 3, c1 = 3, c2 = 5, c3 = 5) [47], which can be
restricted to the hypersurface p = 0 to produce new examples.

2.3.2. a branes on the quintic

the simplest example of supersymmetric 3-cycles on the quintic are the real surfaces
im jzj = 0 with 5
j = 1; this was described in [3] for  = 1. these cycles are determined
by the ve phases (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) up to the diagonal z5 action i  i (which is just
a remnant of the equivalence of homogeneous coordinates under complex multiplication),
so they come in a 625-dimensional irrep of the discrete symmetry s5  z4
5 .

the equationp(jxj)5 = 0, where ixi  ir, always has a unique solution for xk in

terms of the other real coordinates; thus the cycle is the real projective space irp 3. the
rst cohomology group is h 1(irp 3) = z2; by the discussion above (c.f. [31]) the wrapped
3-branes cannot have any continuous moduli, but they can support a discrete wilson line
living in h 1.

to compare these cycles with gepner boundary states it will be useful to nd their
intersection matrix. let us choose the coordinate system z1 = 1 on ip4, so that 1 = 1.
regard the cycle (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) as an embedding of the coordinates x2,x3 and x4 into the
quintic with positive orientation. the other surfaces are obtained by z4
5 rotation from this
5 symmetry,

i (1, 1, 1, 1, 1). since the intersection matrix must respect the z4

i=1 gki

one, q5

13

it can be written as a polynomial in the generators gi and is determined by the matrix

elements

h(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)|(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)i = h(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)|gk2

2 gk3

5 |(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)i

(2.21)

where gki

: z  kiz. s5 symmetry also constrains the problem in an obvious way.

there are dierent possibilities for intersections with the surface (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) in this

coordinate system. if 2, 3, 4 and 5 are all dierent from 1 there is no intersection in

this coordinate patch. if only three of them are dierent from 1 there is exactly one inter-

section in this coordinate patch and the intersection has the signature sgn im 2im 3im 4

assuming that 5 = 1. if the two surfaces intersect on a higher dimensional locus the in-

tersection number has to be calculated by a small deformation of one of the two surfaces.

this deformation has to be normal to both surfaces. because of the special lagrangian

property of the undeformed surfaces this normal bundle of the intersection locus can be

identied with its tangent space. the intersection number is then given by the number of

zeros of a section of the tangent bundle of the intersection locus.

for example, in the case that exactly two js are not 1 the intersection locus is a circle.

a circle can have a nowhere vanishing section of its tangent bundle and the intersection
number in this coordinate patch is 0. as another example, let precisely one j 6= 1. the
intersection locus is then an irp 2. a section of its tangent bundle has one zero, as can be
seen by modding out the hedgehog conguration of an s2 by z2. the orientation of this

intersection is given by the intersection in the remaining complex dimension, i.e. by imj.

in order to compute the full

intersection we must look at all possible patches.

2 3, 1

2 4, 1

2 , 1, 1

this can be done by using the constraint q5
the z1 = 1 coordinate patch, the total intersection number  the coecient ofq5

i=1 gi = 1 to rewrite (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) as
(1
2 5) and so on. we then add all of the intersection numbers
for all of these patches. thus, although we nd that h(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)|(1, , , , )i = 0 in
i=2 gi in
the intersection matrix  is 1. another example is the intersection of (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) with

(1, , , , 1) which gives a circle in the patch z2 = 1 and a point in the patch z1 = 1.

a simple general formula that matches all of these results is

3. stringy geometry

type iib string compactication on a general cy threefold m leads to an n = 2,
d = 4 supergravity with b2,1 + 1 vector elds (b2,1 vector multiplets plus the graviphoton)

and b1,1 + 1 hypermultiplets (including the 4d dilaton); in iia these identications are

reversed. the most basic physical observables which reect the structure of m are those

described by the special geometry of the vector multiplets. this geometry is determined

by a prepotential fk of kahler deformations in the iia case, and by the prepotential fc

for complex structure deformations in the iib case.

a fundamental result from the study of the worldsheet sigma model is that fc can be

determined entirely from classical target space geometry; it receives no worldsheet quantum
() corrections. let us then discuss the complex structure moduli space. choose a basis
for the 3-cycles i  h3(m, zz) (where i = 0, . . . , b2,1, b2,1 + 1, . . . , 2b2,1 + 2), so that the
intersection form ij = i  j has the canonical form: i,b2,1+i+1 = 1 for i = 0, . . . , b2,1,
 = 0 otherwise. the b2,1 +1 vector elds come from reducing the rr potential c(4) on the
a cycles, while the b cycles produce their d = 4 elecromagnetic duals. thus a three-brane

wrapped about the cycle  =pi qii has (electric,magnetic) charge vector qi. note that

h3(x) forms a nontrivial vector bundle over the moduli space mc of complex structures;
a given basis in h3(x, zz) will have monodromy in sp(b3, zz) as it is transported around
singularities in mc.

the primary observables are the periods of the holomorphic three-form,

i =zi

.

in n = 2 language these are the vevs of the scalar elds in the corresponding vector
multiplets. the a-cycle is can be used as projective coordinates on the moduli space;
the b-cycle periods then satisfy the relations j = ijf /i. if we x (for example)
0 = 1 to pass to inhomogeneous coordinates, the related vector eld is the graviphoton.

these periods determine the central charge of a three-brane wrapped about the cycle

 =pi qi[i]:

z =z

 = qii.

thus the mass of a bps three-brane is [48]:

mq = c|z| = c|q  |

15

(3.1)

where c is independent of q. if we use four-dimensional einstein units for m, it is c =

1/gs(r   )1/2.

in contrast to fc, fk receives world-sheet instanton corrections to the classical com-

putation. the exact worldsheet result can be obtained by mirror symmetry: fk for iia on
m is equal to fc for iib on the mirror w to m . of course this requires a map between the

periods of m and w . this analysis has been carried out for the quintic in [12] (see [49]

for a summary) and we will quote the result in this case.

the mirror w to the quintic threefold m can be obtained [50] as a z3

5 quotient of a

special quintic

0 =

5xi=1

z5
i + z1z2z3z4z5 .

the transformation    with 5 = 1 can be undone by the coordinate transformation
z1  1z1 and thus the complex moduli space of w s can be parameterized by 5. this
is an algebraic coordinate, which although not directly observable, does appear naturally

in the world-sheet formulations [51,52].

the moduli space m has three singularities, about which the three-cycles in w will
undergo monodromy. each singularity has physical signicance. first, 5   is the
large complex structure limit mirror to the large volume limit. in this limit [49]

5  e2i(b+ij) ,

(3.2)

where b is the ns b-eld ux around the 2-cycle forming a basis of h2(m ), and j is
the size of that 2-cycle. next, 5  1 is a conifold singularity; here a wrapped three-
brane becomes massless [53]. this turns out to be mirror to the pure six-brane [54,55].
finally, at 5 = 0 the model obtains an additional z5 global symmetry; this is an orbifold
singularity of moduli space. the gepner model (3)5 lives at this point in kahler moduli

space of m [51].

each singularity in m gives a noncontractible loop is associated with a monodromy
on the basis of 3-cycles in w (or even homology in m ) and thus on the periods. we let
a be the monodromy induced by    around  = 0; clearly a5 = 1. t will be the
monodromy induced by going once around the conifold point, and b will be the monodromy
induced by taking   1 around innity. these satisfy the relation b = at . one
may make the physics associated with a given singularity manifest by choosing variables

(the periods) for which the associated monodromy is simple.

16

in our case the periods i satisfy a picard-fuchs dierential equation of hyperge-
ometric type. since b3 = 4 it is fourth order and quite tractable. there will be four

independent solutions and as per the discussion above, we generally want to choose a basis

making one of the monodromies simple. two such bases are particularly natural. the rst
is the large volume basis which we will denote (6, 4, 2, 0)t. up to an upper triangular
transformation this is determined by the asymptotics as 5

 .

(3.3)

the coecients correspond to the classical volumes of the cycles. the signs were chosen

so that the supersymmetric brane congurations have positive relative charges. we will

derive the monodromy below.

the other natural basis for us makes the monodromy a simple, and is appropriate for

describing the gepner point. if we choose a solution g

0 () analytic near  = 0, the set

of solutions

g

i () = g

0 (i)

(3.4)

will provide a basis with the single linear relation 0 = p4

i . it turns out that the
0-brane period 0 (the solution 0 of [12], equation (3.15)) is analytic near  = 0 and
thus we can set g
0 = 0 and dene the others using (3.4). we then (as in [12]) choose
4 )t. in this basis, the three monodromy matrices are 3

3 there is a typo in table i in [12] as published in nuclear physics b.

17

in [12], the relation between the large volume and gepner bases proceeds through
a third basis which we will call 3, which is naturally described by a particular basis of
3-cycles in w . the intersection form in this basis has the canonical form 13 = 24 = 1,
and the t monodromy is simple: 3
4 is the vanishing cycle at the
conifold and 3
2 is its dual. this turns out to be enough information to relate it to the
gepner basis uniquely up to a remaining sl(2, z) acting on 3
3, which we may
x arbitrarily. one then nds a transformation of 3 to a basis satisfying (3.3). this is
an sl(2, z) transformation of the type which was unxed in the previous step; so the 3
basis has no signicance intrinsic to our problem of relating g to the large-volume basis.
thus we will merely quote the nal result for this change of basis, which is:

here q and qg are the charge vectors in the large-radius and gepner basis respectively.
(in the notation of [12], m = kn m: with k a matrix taking the vector (q4, q6, q2, q0)
of their conventions to our conventions; and n taken with a = b = c = 0.) the matrix
l is an as-yet undetermined sp(4, z) ambiguity in the q2 and q0 charges of the six- and
four-branes:

where 14 = 41 = 23 = 32 = 1 from [12].4 l does not enter since it is symplectic,
and so preserves . g has determinant 25 and thus the gepner basis is not canonically
normalized; this point will not be important for us.

4 the signs 6  0 = +1 and 4  2 = 1 in the large volume intersection form  follow

from the denition (2.12).

(3.8)

we want to better understand the ambiguity l. we can start by comparing the

monodromy b with our expectations from the large volume limit. one may dene a basis
of charges such that rr
is the charge under the rr potential c(k+1), with the switch
in four- and six-brane charge as in (3.3). in this basis the eect of the shift b  b + 1
follows from eq. (2.10):

k

the factors 1/2 and 1/6 in this expression come from expanding the exponential (they can

also be seen in (3.3)) and indicate that in this basis the charges are not integers.

the b monodromy in the  basis (3.3) is

b =

3  a 5  2b

 .

(3.9)

eqs. (3.8) and (3.9) agree if a = 11/2 and b = 25/12, i.e. if we make a non-integral
redenition of the charge lattice. the explanation of this is that the intersection form in

the conventions leading to (3.8) is actually not canonical, because it includes the other
terms in (2.10). if we act on the basis (3.3) with the matrix l(a = 11/2, b = 25/12, c),
we can see that the charges are modied in precisely this way. the modication due to b
comes from the a term in (2.12)(as c2 = 50 for the quintic). a induces a two-brane charge
on the four-brane and might come from c1 of its normal bundle. these eects were referred
to in [19] as the geometric witten eect.

the most interesting ambiguity comes from c which induces zero-brane charge on the
six-brane. in [12] this was attributed to the sigma model four-loop r4 correction in the

bulk lagrangian. in the d-brane context, one possibility is that this comes from an as yet

unknown term at this order in the d-brane world-volume lagrangians. we should also

keep in mind that the intersection form we are computing involves the bulk propagation

of the rr elds between the branes, so another possibility is that it comes from a partner
to the r4 term in the bulk lagrangian which aects the rr kinetic term in a curved

background.

in [12], the redenition l was used to make the charge basis integral, but an overall

sp(4, z) ambiguity was left over. it is in general more useful to have an integer charge

basis so we will follow this procedure (this was already done implicitly as we took integer

19

coecients in the change of basis). we can resolve most of the sp(4, z) ambiguity by

calling the state which becomes massless at the mirror of the conifold point a pure six-

brane with large volume charges (1 0 0 0), following [54,55]. this determines b = c = 0. a

geometrical argument for this is that any uxes on the six-brane would produce additional

contributions to its energy. if there is a line from the large volume limit to the conifold

point along which the six-brane becomes massless with no marginal stability issues, this

argument will presumably be valid. another argument is that we will nd this state as

a gepner model boundary state with no moduli, as is appropriate for a pure six-brane.

finally, this choice simplies the charge assignments for the other boundary states.

we still have the ambiguity in a to x. as it happens this does not enter into the

results we discuss, so we have no principled way to do this. we will simply set it to zero.

4. boundary states in cft

4.1. some results from boundary conformal eld theory

a cft on a riemann surface with boundary requires specifying boundary conditions

on the operators. for sigma models these conditions can be derived by imposing dirichlet

and/or neumann boundary conditions directly on the sigma model elds. for more general

cfts we do not have a nice lagrangian description; so the construction, classication, and

interpretation of boundary conditions is not straightforward.

if the cft has a chiral symmetry algebra one may simplify the problem by demanding

that the boundary conditions are invariant under the symmetry. we can start with the vi-

rasoro algebra which must be preserved (particularly in string theory where the symmetry

is gauged). let the boundary be at z = z in some local coordinates. reparameterizations
should leave the boundary xed, so we must impose t = t . if the remaining symmetry
algebra is generated by chiral currents w (r) with spin sr, then the boundary conditions

are

w (r) =  w (r) ,

(4.1)

where  is an automorphism of the symmetry algebra.

we are interested in describing bps d-branes which preserve n = 1 spacetime susy.
the closed-string sector will have at least n = (2, 2) worldsheet susy and the boundary

20

conditions must preserve a diagonal n = 2 part [56,57]. eq. (4.1) leads to two classes of
boundary conditions [6]: the a-type boundary conditions

t = t , j =  j, g+ =  g ,

and the b-type boundary conditions

t = t , j = j, g+ =  g+ .

(4.2)

(4.3)

these conventions correspond to the open-string channel where the boundary propagates

in worldsheet time. for calabi-yau compactication at large volume, a-type boundary

conditions correspond to d-branes wrapped around middle-dimensional supersymmetric

cycles; and b-type boundary conditions to d-branes wrapped around even-dimensional

supersymmetric cycles [6].

a cft on an annulus can also be studied in the closed-string channel where time ows

from the one boundary to the other. the boundaries appear as initial and nal conditions

on the path integral and are described in the operator formalism by coherent boundary

states [58,59]. the boundary conditions (4.1) can be rewritten in the closed-string channel

as operator conditions on these boundary states; for example

jn = jn
jn =  jn

a type

b type.

the relative sign change from (4.2),(4.3) can be understood as the result of a /2 rotation

on the components of the spin one current; it means that the a-type states are charged

under (c, c) operators and the b-type under (c, a) operators.

the solution to these conditions [60,61] are linear combinations of the ishibashi

states:

|iii =xn

|i, ni  u |i, ni .

(4.4)

here |ii is a highest weight state of the extended chiral algebra; the sum is over all de-
n u =
scendants of |ii; and u is an anti-unitary map with u|i, 0i = |i, 0i
(1)sr w (r)
n .

and u w (r)



modular invariance requires that calculations in either channel have the same result.

this gives powerful restrictions on possible boundary states. in particular one requires

that a transition amplitude between dierent boundary states can be written as a sensible

21

open-string partition function, via a modular transformation. for rational cfts with

certain restrictions, cardy [13] showed that the allowed linear combinations of ishibashi

states (4.4) are:

|iii =xj

bj

i|jii =xj

sj

iqsj

0

|jii .

(4.5)

if j is a character of the extended chiral algebra, then sj
is the matrix representation
i
of the modular transformation   1/ . in this notation capital and lower-case letters
denote the same representation; we use capital letters to denote this particular linear

combination of ishibashi states. we may also associate a bra state to the representation
i conjugate to i:

 hhi| =xj

 hhj|bj
i .

(4.6)

these boundary states are in one-to-one correspondence with open-string boundary con-

ditions which we will label the same way. cardy argued that the open-string partition

function was determined by the fusion rule coecients. let worldsheet time and space be

labelled by  and  respectively; and let the boundary run from  = 0 to  = , and
the boundary conditions be i and j, respectively. then the number of times that the
representation k appears in the open-string spectrum is precisely the fusion rule coecient
n k

ij ; in other words, the open-string partition function will be

zij =xk

n k

ij k .

(4.7)

4.2. the gepner model in the bulk

gepner models [62,63] (see also [64] for a quick review) are exactly solvable cfts which

correspond to calabi-yau compactications at small radius [51]. they are tensor products
of r n = 2 minimal models together with an orbifold-like projection that couples the
spin structures and allows only odd-integer u (1) charge. we will review their construction

here. for simplicity we will discuss theories with d + r = even, where d is the number of

complex, transverse, external dimensions in light cone gauge.

our building blocks are the n = 2 minimal models at level k; these are scfts with
k+2 < 3 [65,66,67,68]. the superconformal primaries are labelled by 3

central charge c = 3k

integers, (l, m, s) with

0  l  k;

|m  s|  l; s  {1, 0, 1};

l + m + s = 0 mod 2 .

(4.8)

22

the integers l and m are familiar from the su (2)k wzw model and can be understood
from the parafermionic construction of the minimal models [69,70]. s determines the spin
structure: s = 0 in the ns sector; and s = 1 are the two chiralities in the r sector.5 the
conformal weights and u (1) charges of these primary elds are:

hl
m,s =

ql
m,s =

l(l + 2)  m2
4(k + 2)
s
m
k + 2 
2

.

+

s2

,

(4.9)

the n = 2 chiral primaries are clearly (l, l, 0) in the ns sector. the related ramond
sector states (l, l, 1) can be reached by spectral ow. the minimal models can also be
described by a landau-ginzburg model of a single supereld with superpotential x k+2
[71,72,73,74,75]. at the conformal point x l = (l, l, 0) and the landau-ginzburg elds

provide a simple representation of the chiral ring.

the n = 2 characters and their modular properties are described in [76,77,62,63]; we
will follow the notation in [62,63]. one extends the s variable to take values in z4. the ns
characters are labelled by s = 0, 2 and the dierent values of s denote opposite z2 fermion
number. the contribution from the ns primary is in l,m,0. similarly, in r sector s = 1
denotes contributions from opposite fermion number: the s = 1(s = 3) character includes
the contribution from the s = 1(s = 1) ramond-sector primary. these characters are
actually well-dened dened in the range l  {0,    , k}, m  z2k+4 and s  z4, where
l + m + s = even. they obey the identication l
m+k+2,s+2 by which the elds can

m,s = kl

be brought into the range (4.8).

not every c = 9 tensor product of minimal models will give a consistent string com-

pactication with 4d spacetime susy. we must nd a reasonable gso projection, and we

must project onto states with odd integer u (1) charges [56]. we must then add twisted

sectors in order to maintain modular invariance. the resulting spectrum is most easily

represented by the partition function, for which we require some notation. we will tensor
r minimal models at level kj with the cft of at spacetime. the latter also has a n = 2
worldsheet susy in our case, and we denote the characters by the indices i. the vector
 = (l1,    , lr) gives the lj quantum numbers and the vector  = (m1,    , mr; s1,    , sr),
the charges and spin structures. now dene j=1,...,r to be the charge vector with a two at
the position of sj, and all other entries zero; and dene 0 to be the charge vector with all

5 the variable m in [70], in sec. 2.1 of [62], and sec. 4 of [63], is what we are calling m  s.

23

entries one. the modular invariant partition function in light cone gauge can be written

as [62,63]:

z = x(i,i),,xb0,bj

(1)b0 i,,(q)i,,+b00+pj

(q) ,

bj j

(4.10)

here i,, is the character for the r minimal models speciced by ,  and for the character
of the at transverse spacetime coordinates (labelled by i). in the sum, b0 = 0,    , 2k  1,
bj = 0, 1 and k = lcm{2, kj + 2}.  is a kronecker delta function enforcing both odd
integral u (1) charge and the condition that all factors of the tensor product have the same

spin structure.

the kth minimal model has a zk+2  z2 symmetry [62,78] which acts as:

gl

hl

m,s,

m,s = e2i m
k+2 l
m,s = (1)sl

m,s .

(4.11)

with the above projection, all z2 symmetries have the same action on a given state and are
identied. the remaining z2 symmetry acts only on r states by reversing their sign. the
zk+2 symmetry is correlated with the u (1) charge. in particular, the diagonal generator

g =qj gj is the identity for integral u (1) charges. the gepner model is an orbifold theory;

the orbifold group h is the group generated by g. the remaining discrete symmetry is
i=1zkr+2/h. for example, the (k = 3)5 model is an orbifold by the diagonal z5 of
r
(z5)5 .

4.3. boundary states in the gepner model

it is dicult to construct the most general boundary state for the gepner model,

because the gepner model is not rational. following [7], we will consider states which
respect the n = 2 world-sheet algebras of each minimal model factor of the gepner model
separately, and can be found by cardys techniques. they are labeled according to cardys

notation by  = (lj, mj, sj) and an automorphism  of the chiral symmetry algebra. in
our case there are two choices of  giving either a- or b-type boundary conditions;  must

have the same action on every factor of the tensor product.

recknagel and schomerus [7] proved the modular invariance of a- and b-type bound-

ary states with internal part:

 denotes the constraint that the ishibashi state |, ii must appear in the closed string
partition function (4.10). for a-type boundary states this is no constraint as the ishibashi

states are already built on diagonal primary states and  already enforces that total u (1)

charge is integral. however, the b-type ishibashi states have opposite u (1) charge in the

holomorphic and antiholomorphic sector, and these only appear as a consequence of the

gso projection; so the b constraint requires that all the mj are the same modulo kj + 2.
finally, an integer normalization constant c has to be included in 
 to get the correct

normalization for the open-string partition function.

it is easy to see from eqs. (4.12),(4.13) that the action of the zkj +2 (z2) symmetries
is mj  mj + 2 (sj  sj + 2). as a result of the  constraint, the two physically

inequivalent choices for sj are s = p sj = 0, 2 mod 4. the sj = odd case seems to be

inconsistent because their rr-charges do not t into a charge lattice together with the
s = even states; thus they will violate the charge quantization conditions6. in the end,

due to the z2 symmetry, it is enough to consider only boundary states with s = 0. a

boundary state can be written as

for b-type boundary states, the  constraint in eq. (4.12) implies in addition that the

physically inequivalent choices of mj can be described by the quantity

m =xj

kmj
kj + 2

,

6 the amplitude between a s = odd boundary state and a s = even boundary state also has

interchanged roles of r- and ns-states in the open string sector.

25

where k = lcm{kj + 2}.

we will be interested in counting the number of moduli for a d-brane state; these

will be the massless bosonic (i.e. ns) open-string states. to nd their contribution to

the open-string partition function, it is enough to examine the ns-ns part of a transition

amplitude in the internal dimensions. the reason is that the (open-string) ns characters

arising from the modular transformations of the rr part of the transition amplitude come
with an insertion of (1)f [76,77]. with this in mind, a calculation similar to that in [7]
leads to7

projection and the su (2)k fusion rule coecients constrain the open string spectrum of
b-type boundary states; these states are much richer as a consequence.

the condition that two d-brane boundary states |ii and | ii, with the same external

(4.16)

to explore the charge lattice of the boundary states, and to nd the geometric inter-

pretation of given boundary states, we wish to calculate the intersection (2.11)(2.12) of
our branes. the cft quantity which computes this is i = tr r(1)f in the open string
sector [11]. the best way to do this is to start in the closed string sector and to do a

modular transformation to the open string sector. in the closed string sector this trace
corresponds to the amplitude between the rr parts of the boundary states with a (1)fl
inserted. the calculation is done in the appendix and the result for a-type boundary

states is:

the intersection matrix depends only on the dierences m  m as was required by the
discrete symmetry. we also see that the z2 action s  s + 2 changes the orientation of a
brane.

in the next section we will rewrite these formulas in a more compact notation and use

them to identify the charges of the boundary states.

4.4. d-branes on k3 and the mukai formula

for compactications with n = 4 worldsheet supersymmetry, the index in the ra-
mond sector is directly related to the number of marginal operators in the ns sector. we

now use this to give a cft proof of mukais formula [80,19] for the dimension of the moduli

space of 1/2-bps d-brane states.

k3 compactications are geometric throughout their moduli space [81]. the bps

d-brane states in these compactications are described by coherent semistable sheaves e

[19] which can be labelled by the mukai vector [80,19]. in terms of the rank r and chern

classes ci of e, this is

v(e) =(cid:0)r, c1, c2

1  c2 + r(cid:1)

 h 0(m, zz)  h 2(x, zz)  h 4(m, zz)

there is a natural inner product on the space of mukai vectors:

h(r, s, ), (r, s, )i = s  s  r  r

(4.19)

(4.20)

where s  s is dened by the natural intersection pairing of 2-cycles on m . in fact this is
just (minus) the intersection form (2.12).

mukais theorem [80] states that the complex dimension of the moduli space of an

irreducible coherent sheaf e is:

dimension = hv(e), v(e)i + 2.

we now argue that this follows from the relation

tr a,a(1)f = hv(ea), v(ea)i

27

(4.21)

(4.22)

and general properties of supersymmetry. first, only two d = 2, n = 4 representations
have nonvanishing witten indices [82,83]. we list them below together with the ns weights

related by spectral ow:

identity rep. : (h = 0,  = 0)ns  (h = 1/4,  = 1/2)r
massless rep. : (h = 1/2,  = 1/2)ns  (h = 1/4,  = 0)r

tr(1)f = 2

tr(1)f = 1 ,

(4.23)

where  is the su (2)r isospin. the identity representations lead to world-volume d = 6,
n = 1 (or d = 4, n = 2) gauge multiplets, while the massless representations lead to
world-volume half-hypermultiplets, so there will be one complex scalar in the open-string

sector for each massless multiplet.

let there be ng identity and nm massless multiplets; then the witten index is

tr (1)f = nm  2ng.

(4.24)

using (4.22) we nd that (4.21) will be true if the world-volume theory has a (higgs
branch) moduli space of complex dimension nm2ng +2. this moduli space is essentially
determined by the d = 6, n = 1 world-volume supersymmetry:
it is the hyperkahler
quotient of the conguration space by the subgroup g of the gauge group which acts non-
trivially on the hypermultiplets. the resulting space has complex dimension nm2 dim g.
now, any brane conguration will have an overall u (1) acting trivially whose partners

in the vector multiplet are the center of mass position of the brane; if more u (1)s act

trivially we will have more center of mass moduli, so such a conguration must correspond
to a reducible bundle. therefore dim g = ng  1 for an irreducible bundle and we have
proven (4.21).

4.5. generalizations

mukais theorem used the hirzebruch-riemann-roch formula together with special

properties of k3 surfaces; these properties allowed one to extract the dimension of the

moduli space of a bundle directly from the holomorphic euler characteristic. we have a

similar statement for cy threefolds if we keep track of both chiralities separately. the self-

intersection number of a brane on a threefold is of course zero, but we can get non-trivial

statements if we consider the intersection of two dierent branes.

28

for example, consider the index of the dirac operator on the bundle e. since the

world-volume is kahler this is

ind /d =

3xi=0

(1)i dim h i(m, e) = (e)

which is the holomorphic euler characteristic. by the hirzebruch-riemann-roch formula,

(e) =zm

ch(e)td(t m ) .

(4.25)

here

ch(e) = r + c1(e) +

1

2(cid:0)c2
1(e)  2c2(e)(cid:1) +

1

6(cid:0)c3
1(e)  3c1(e)c2(e) + 3c3(e)(cid:1) + . . . ,

and

td(t m ) = 1 +

c2(t m )

12

+ . . . = 1 

p1(t m )

24

+ + . . .

thus on a threefold, td(m ) = a(t m ), and combining eqs. (4.25) and (2.12), we nd:

ind /d = hd6, d(e)i = tr d6,d(e)(1)f ,

(4.26)

where d(e) is the d-brane representation or generalized mukai vector for e.

on the other hand, the ramond ground states which contribute to the open string

index are exactly the fermion zero modes which contribute to the index of /d. in the type

i case where e is a gauge bundle with vevs entirely in an su (3) subgroup and with the

gauge connection equal to the spin connection, c1(e) = 0; this gives a brane picture of the

standard result

ng = (# of generations) =zm

c3
2

for this case. if we are interested not in the bulk gauge theory on 9-branes in type i but

in a gauge theory on a brane b intersecting another brane a, the generalization is that

the number of generations (with respect to the b gauge group) associated with the brane
a is the intersection form ha, bi. for b-type branes this follows from eq. (2.12) and the
hirzebruch-riemann-roch theorem for the bundle e(a)  e(b); for a-type branes each
intersection contributes a chiral multiplet with chirality given by the sign of the intersection

[17].

29

5. discussion of the 35 model

let us apply these results to the example to model (k = 3)5, the gepner point in the
moduli space of the quintic. we will consider boundary states labelled by lj  {0, 1},
0  mj < (2k + 4) = 10, and s = 0. let the z4
5 symmetry be generated by the
operators gj taking mj  mj + 2, and satisfying g1    g5 = 1. note that g1/2
j which takes
mj  mj + 1 is well-dened for these states (using the identications on lm s, it relates
branes to antibranes).

we will be particularly interested in computing the intersection forms (4.17) and

(4.18), as we will be able to use them to extract the charges and open string spectrum

for a given brane. the main advantage of considering these quantities over the charges

themselves is that they are canonically normalized, as already noted in [1].

we can consider the intersection form as a matrix i acting on the space of boundary

states; since it commutes with z4

5 it can be written as a function of the generators gi. the
main content of formulae (4.17) and (4.18) is contained in the su (2) fusion rule coecients.

in these equations the labels mj, fmj can be thought of as indices of a matrix acting on

the states. the particular fusion coecients we will need are:8

j ) = n00 g

j (1 + g4

 (1  g4
j ),
j (1  g3
 g
 (1 + gj  g3

these various fusion matrices are related by successive multiplication with g
j ), so
we can express the rr charges of all our boundary states in terms of those for q(|00000i).
by eq. (4.16) there are two cases of pairs of branes preserving a common susy. if

j (1 + g4

1
2

the total l is even (so integral powers of g appear), a pair with m = s = 0 (brane
and brane) will preserve susy. if the total l is odd (powers g5k+5/2 appear), a pair with

m = 5 and s = 2 (brane and anti-brane) will preserve susy.

in the case that the two d-branes are both a-type or b-type, the massless open string

spectrum can also be expressed in terms of the fusion coecients. it is easy to see from

(4.14) and (4.15) that if the two boundary states are the same, there is exactly one vacuum

and one spectral ow operator in the open string channel; if they are not the same, neither

8 the coecients for m > l are dened in the appendix.

30

state propagates. this means that the unbroken worldvolume gauge group is (the center-

of-mass) u (1), and the brane can be viewed as a single object (a priori, it still might be a

bound state).

the susy-preserving moduli of the d-branes are constructed from chiral vertex op-

erators. the witten index counts these operators albeit with a sign depending on their

chirality. in our explicit cft calculation we can remove this sign by hand, and thus the

total number of chiral elds can be calculated using (4.17) and (4.18) with the fusion ma-
trices replaced by their absolute values.9 we can again write this modied matrix as a

polynomial p(gj) in the shift matrices gj. for example, the matrix for boundary states
|11111ib is:

pb(g) = (1 + g + g3 + g4)5 .

(5.2)

if spacetime supersymmetry is preserved, the chiral elds have integer u (1) charges, and
are related to antichiral elds by spectral ow. in particular charge-2 chiral elds in z
 ,
are related to charge-1 antichiral elds in z
 ; the latter are the hermitian conjugate of
charge-1 chiral elds in z

. thuspk mk in the open-string channel will be a multiple of

5 for marginal, chiral vertex operators. examination of the fusion coecients in (4.17) and

(4.18) reveals that the number of massless chiral superelds is given by counting terms in

1
2

(p(gj)  2)

with the total power of g being a multiple of 5
2 .

applying these statements to eq. (5.2) shows that the d-brane described by |11111ib
has 101 marginal operators. this particular case can also be worked out by checking that

the fusion rules lead to all possible l values, so for every operator in the (c, c) ring of the

model there is a corresponding chiral open string operator.

5.1. a boundary states

the intersection matrix (4.17) for the a-type boundary states with lj = 0 is

ia = (1  g4

1)(1  g4

2)(1  g4

3)(1  g4

4)(1  g1g2g3g4).

(5.3)

to determine the rank of the intersection matrix we can count the number of nonzero

eigenvalues. the gj can be diagonalized as gj = diag(1, e
values appear if a gj = 1 or if g1g2g3g4 = 1. the combinatorics leads to 204 nonzero

31

eigenvalues, which is the number of independent 3-cycles on the quintic. thus, the lj = 0
states provide a basis for the charge lattice. so far as we can tell they do not provide an

integral basis of the charge lattice. furthermore, the charges of the other a-type gepner

boundary states can be obtained from these by successive multiplication by g

j ); for
1 |10000ia) = q(|00000ia) + q(g1|00000ia), so these are even farther from

the intersection matrix for the |11111ia states,

5yi=1

(1 + gi  g3

i  g4
i )

coincides with the intersection matrix (2.22) for the three-cycles im jzj = 0, and thus we
identify these states with the irp 3s.

this leads to a potential contradiction with the large volume limit in that the l = 1
states have one marginal operator, while the irp 3s do not. although it might be that

this is indeed a contradiction, from what we know at present an equally likely resolution is

that the l = 1 marginal operator is not strictly marginal; in other words the world-volume

theory has a superpotential for the corresponding eld , perhaps of the form

w = 3 + 

where  is the kahler modulus (5 in the notation of section 3). such a superpotential
has two ground states and would also t the fact that the irp 3 has a z2 wilson line in
the large volume limit.

5.2. b boundary states

as we discussed in the previous section, the b-type boundary states at xed lj are

described by the single integer, m =p mj and the gj for dierent j are identied. the

intersection matrix (4.18) for l = 0 states can be written as:

ib = (1  g1)5 = 5g  10g2 + 10g3  5g4.

(5.4)

we want to describe these boundary states to the gepner basis. the gepner intersection

form (3.7) in the same notation is:

ig = g + 3g2  3g3 + g4 .

32

(5.5)

a linear change of basis preserving the action of z5 can be written as a polynomial in the
operator g as well and a transformation of the form i  mimt will be i  im(g)m(g1).
the relation

provides this change of basis.

ib = (1  g)(1  g1)ig

the results of section 3 allow us to write these charges in the large volume basis. the

gepner charge vector qg is related to the large volume charge vector q as

thus qg = ( 0 1 1
brane. the other charges can be found by acting with the operator al.

0 0

0 ) which is a pure (anti)six-

q = qgm1 .
0 ) becomes ql = (1

one can now compute the charges for the l 6= 0 branes by using the multiplicative

relation in (5.1). for example, we have

q(g

5

2 h|10000ib) = q(g2|00000ib)  q(g3|00000ib).

starting with m = 0 and successively applying this operation produces a subset of branes

which preserve the same supersymmetry. this can be checked by computing the central

charges using the periods at the gepner point, which are simply the fth roots of unity.

thus the central charge for the lth brane in this series is

z(l) = (2 cos


5

)lz(0).

the charges in the gepner basis charges can written in large volume basis viq eq.

(3.6). tabulating these results and the numbers of marginal operators, we have (for the
z5 representatives related to the six-brane)

q6 q4 q2 q0

(5.6)

the simple pattern ql+1 = ql + ql1 follows from the identity (g2 g3)2 = 1 g2 g3.
it is also easy to compute the number of marginal operators between pairs of distinct
boundary states. for example, |00000ib and |(1 . . .)l(0 . . .)i have (for 1  l  5) 4, 3, 3, 4
and 1 (respectively) marginal operators. each corresponds to a chiral supereld of charge
(1, 1) and its charge conjugate (since the mutual intersection numbers are zero, none of
these pairs has chiral spectra). the number of operators between two branes of higher l
of course depends on which li are non-zero.

33

5.3. comparison with geometrical results

to what extent can we compare these results with the geometrical branes and bundles

we discussed in section 2? the only clear match is the six-brane which indeed has no moduli

as expected.

our states can plausibly be identied with vector bundles since they obey the stability

condition c2 > 0. we were not able to identify any of them with the explicit constructions

we mentioned in section 2. this may just reect our lack of knowledge of vector bundles

on the quintic; thus we might regard our results as predictions of the existence of new

vector bundles. we should note that the numbers of marginal operators we obtained are

only upper bounds for the dimension of the moduli space as in general these theories will

have potentials.

the problematic objects are the |11000ib branes as an object with these charges
cannot be a classical line bundle. for reasons explained in section 2 we do not believe it

is a quantum bound state either, since we have found it at string tree level. there is a

piece of evidence that it is some sort of bound state of the six-brane with the two-brane

(2.19): namely, they come in the same multiplet of the discrete symmetries. like all b
branes, the |11000ib branes are invariant under z4
5 , while s5 acts by permuting the li
labels. the two-brane construction (2.19) also picks out two of the ve coordinates and

thus comes in the same multiplet. this identication creates a puzzle opposite to the one
we faced for the irip3s: the geometric object appears to have more moduli (12) than

the boundary state. such a mismatch could not be xed by a superpotential. on the

other hand, it could be that the (unknown) mechanism which binds the two-brane to the

six-brane removes moduli, so this is not a clear disagreement.

one candidate for such a bound state is the instanton in noncommutative u (1) gauge

theory [84]. again by analogy with at space, (since noncommutative geometry has not

been formulated on curved spaces, this is all we can say), at generic values of b we might

expect the d6-brane gauge theory to be noncommutative [85,86,87]. the center-of-mass

position of the instanton would then (presumably) give the moduli of a two-brane and

provide at least some of the moduli we observe. a potential problem with this idea is that

we can continue to b = 0 in the large volume limit, and there is no sign that this bound

state is unstable there.

one may ask why the d0-brane does not appear on our list. one possible explanation

is that the path from the large volume limit to the gepner point crosses a line of marginal

34

stability, and the d0 does not exist at the gepner point. to test this we found the periods

for all the branes in (5.6) by numerically integrating the picard-fuchs equations along the

negative real  axis. we found that the d0 is lighter than any brane from the list along the

whole trajectory, so we have no evidence for instability. our favored explanation is simply

that all of the b branes by construction are invariant under the z4

5 discrete symmetry,
while any location we might pick for the d0 would break some of this symmetry. thus,

even if the d0 exists at the gepner point, it cannot be a recknagel-schomerus state, at

least in this model.

6. superpotential and topological sigma models

the calculations of the previous section describe the eld content of the d-brane

world-volumes, but not their dynamics. the primary question in this regard is to nd the

world-volume potential and true moduli spaces for the brane theories. in cft language,

the marginal boundary operators operators we found might not be strictly marginal.

n = 1, d = 4 supersymmetry tells us that the world-volume potential will be a sum of
f-terms and fayet-iliopoulos d-terms. the d-terms are simply determined by the gauge

group and charges of the matter elds. in the case of a single brane or n identical branes

we have checked in the models we are studying that the gauge group is u (n ) with all

matter uncharged under the diagonal u (1), so there is no possibility for a d-term. more

generally we must consider such terms, for example in the case of d0-branes near orbifold

points.

however, we may expect a non-vanishing superpotential, in general constrained only

by holomorphy and the symmetries of the problem. these conditions are often stronger

than they might appear, but in general the superpotential must be found by explicit

computation.

it should eventually be possible to do exact calculations at the gepner

point, as we will discuss in the next section.

in this section we will try to make some

general statements about the superpotential in these models by showing that they can be

calculated as amplitudes in some topologically twisted version of the open string theory.

in particular we will use this fact to describe the cubic term in the superpotential, and to

discuss to what extent the superpotential couples to the background cy geometry.

35

6.1. known examples of brane superpotentials

in order to motivate the search for superpotentials in these theories we will start with

a few examples where we know they arise. the most obvious example is n d3-branes in

at space; one may write the n = 4 lagrangian in n = 1 notation so that there are 3
adjoint complex scalar elds zi=1,2,3 = zi
ata with the superpotential tr z1[z2, z3] (here
ta are adjoint matrices for u (n )). of course this vanishes for n = 1 but not for n > 1.

a plausible generalization of this to weak curvature (still preserving n = 1 world-

volume susy) is a function w written as a single trace of the adjoint chiral superelds

and with the property that

for variations around the diagonal vevs zi = zi1. the assumption of this form of the

superpotential is a fairly weak constraint; see [88] for analysis along these lines. in the

case of a large calabi-yau threefold, we will nd below that this assumption is correct,

and that  is the holomorphic (3, 0) form of the threefold.

a well-studied genuinely stringy example is that of d-branes near orbifold singular-

ities, or near resolved orbifolds with string-scale curvature. in these examples a single

brane (in the orbifold limit they are described by chan-paton factors in the regular rep-

resentation of the orbifold group) can have a superpotential, which furthermore can have

non-trivial dependence on the closed string moduli. a single brane is described via

chan-paton factors transforming in the regular representation of the orbifold group [5].

the superpotential takes the general form

w = tr z1[z2, z3]|proj + itr zi .

(6.2)

the spectrum of these models is obtained as a subset of the n = 4 sym spectrum [5,89,90],
and the notation w|proj indicates that the n = 4 superpotential is simply restricted to
this subset. the i are closed string moduli.

this intrinsically stringy background illustrates the important lesson that by varying

both closed and open string moduli, it is possible to bring down new massless open string

states invisible in the weakly-curved geometric limit described above. for example, the
c2/z2 model of a single brane has u (1) gauge symmetry generically; but when both closed-
and open-string moduli are tuned to the orbifold point, the gauge symmetry is enhanced

36

to u (1)2. furthermore a new branch of moduli space meets this point, where the single

brane breaks up into branes wrapping the shrunken cycles of the orbifold [5,91]. this

new branch is a transition from higgs to coulomb branch and as usual in supersymmetric

gauge theory it is almost impossible to predict such transitions starting from the higgs

branch. in the present context we see that we should be wary of arguments that rely on

the distinction between congurations involving one or several branes, or equivalently

one or several distinct world-sheet boundary conditions, as they can be continuously

connected. other examples where this distinction is questionable are a small instanton
leaving a dp-brane as a dp  4-brane, or an intersection of 2-branes as described by [92].
another point we will return to is that the closed string moduli i which appear in the
superpotential in this example are complex structure moduli. of course orbifold resolution

also depends on kahler moduli, but these enter in the fayet-iliopoulos d-terms.

our nal example is the superpotential on a wrapped two-brane. recall that a super-

symmetric theory arises when we wrap the 2-brane on a holomorphic cycle. the massless

elds correspond to innitesimal deformations of this cycle into a cycle close by in the

d-brane moduli space. witten [93] has argued that an m-theory two-brane (or 5-brane)

wrapped around a two-cycle  has the superpotential

w () =zb



(6.3)

when  is homologically trivial where b is a three-manifold bounded by . indeed, this is a

holomorphic functional of the embedding coordinates, which is minimized by holomorphic

curves. when  is in a nontrivial homology class, the superpotential is dened up to an

additive constant as:

w ()  w (0) =zb



(6.4)

where 0 is an arbitrarily chosen referent holomorphic 2-cycle in the same homology class
as , and b has boundary  0. here the additive constant depends both on 0 and the
homology class of b. for purely classical, geometric deformations these formulae should

hold for d2-branes; there may also be terms arising from the gauge elds on the d2-brane

worldvolume.

before discussing the computation in general, we note that in all of our examples,

which are of b-type branes, the superpotential depends on closed string moduli only

through the complex structure, not through the kahler structure. could it be that this is

a general statement?

37

we can see some potential problems with the statement by considering the other

branes on the list. first of all, we need to describe not just the embedding but also

the gauge bundle on the branes. to the extent that this is determined by a choice of a

holomorphic vector bundle, this will t into the same class of problems depending only

on complex structure data. however, one might object that general four- and six-brane
congurations involve a gauge bundle with c2 6= 0 and such a holomorphic bundle will
correspond to a solution of yang-mills only if it is stable, a condition which depends on

the kahler class. this condition indeed should enter into the potential but as we discussed

in section 2, it is more natural to expect that it appears as a d-term, which would not

contradict the decoupling statement.

mirror symmetry for boundary states [6] and the statement we are considering would

together imply that the superpotential for a-type branes depends on the kahler structure

of the background, but not the complex structure. but any formula for the potential

on the brane analogous to (6.3) will necessarily involve both structures, since the special

lagrangian condition cannot be stated without bringing in .

this situation can only be compatible with our decoupling statement if the terms
involving  are d-terms, an assertion not contradicted by any existing results.10 one might

object that this possibility would require charged matter under a gauge group which is not

immediately apparent, but the small instanton and orbifold examples show that such gauge

groups can be broken and become invisible in the large volume limit. this would lead to

the further interesting possibility that, at special moduli points in the space of a single

3-brane, enhanced gauge symmetry could appear. the simplest way this could happen is
for the brane to split in two at a self-intersection, leading to u (1)2 gauge symmetry.

we conclude that we have several examples in which decoupling (before taking stringy

corrections into account) is clear, and no examples in which it is clearly false. thus we

will consider this decoupling statement further below.

6.2. cft computation of superpotential

given the above examples, we have good reason to believe that the gepner model

boundary states we have constructed correspond to d-branes with worldvolume superpo-

tentials. we want to know how to calculate these in the models at hand.

10 related questions are being considered by g. tian.

38

we are interested in bps d-branes in n = 2 compactications of type ii string theory;
these lead to n = 1 worldvolume theories. thus the open- (closed-) string sectors will
have n = 2 (n = (2, 2)) worldsheet supersymmetry [56,57]. to x notation we write out
the ope algebra for the holomorphic piece:

t (z)t (w)

for compactications with c = 9 j(z) can be constructed from the internal part of the

j(z) = i3h

and operators with charge q under this u (1) r-symmetry can be written as:

oq = ei(qh/3)o0 .

(6.6)

(6.7)

the spacetime susy currents can be constructed from the macroscopic spin elds
and the internal u (1) current algebra. in the (1/2) picture, the currents can be written
as:

will label the (complex) internal moduli of the d-brane conguration on the cy threefold

m ; these moduli correspond to marginal boundary operators of the internal cft. (ij)

label gauge indices, which are described by chan-paton factors on the worldsheet. these

could be adjoint indices if there are coincident branes, or bifundamental indices if there are

several types of (possibly intersecting) branes. more abstractly, the o-diagonal terms are

boundary condition-changing operators [13] and the diaginal terms are boundary condition-

preserving operators.

the superpotential can be written via a holomorphic function w () and it contributes

the following terms to the lagrangian:

where we use the supereld conventions in [94]. we are interested in small uctuations

about a reference d-brane state, so we expand w () in a taylor series in . all of the

terms of interest in eq. (6.10) will be of the form

tr (cid:20)wi1i2i3...in(cid:18)f i1 i2 . . . in 

1
2

i1 i2i3 . . . in(cid:19)(cid:21) .

the coecients w may also depend on the closed-string background. we will examine

small uctuations about some reference background so that we can sensibly expand w in

a taylor series in uctuations of the closed-string background.

the worldvolume fermions are represented in the open string theory by dimension 1
boundary ramond vertex operators constructed from spin elds. in the (1/2) picture
they can be written as:

v (1/2)
r,ij =  

i,ae/2sita

ij ,

(6.11)

where s is the spacetime part of the spin eld and has dimension 1/4; i is the internal
part of the boundary vertex operator and has dimension 3/8;  carries polarization and
gauge indices; and ta
ij are the chan-paton matrices. since we are interested in computing
a potential term we are interested in zero-momentum amplitudes, so we can omit spacetime
momentum factors eikx . note that the spacetime directions will have standard dirichlet
or neumann conditions, so that s is easily related to its bulk counterpart, for example
by the doubling trick.11

11 c.f. [95] for a nice discussion of this method.

40

similarly, the worldvolume scalars are represented by ns vertex operators.

in the

(1) picture they can be written as

v (1)
ns,ij = i,aeita

ij

(6.12)

where e has dimension 1/2, and  is a dimension 1/2 boundary operator arising from
the internal sector. to nd the 0-picture operator, we nd the superpartner of  under
the (gauged) worldsheet n = 1 susy,

tf (z)i(w) =

1
2

(z  w)oi(w) ,

(6.13)

where tf = 12
(g+ +g) is the gauged n = 1 part of the n = 2 superconformal currents.
here oi has dimension 1. the vertex operator is simply oi; if it is exactly marginal its
integral over the boundary is a valid conformal deformation of the worldsheet action. note
that if i is a chiral primary,

as z  w, and may write

g+(z)i(w) = (non  singular terms)

g(z)i(w) =

1
2

(z  w)oi .

the internal part of the vertex operators for the auxilliary elds, in the (0) picture,
can be constructed from the internal part of the (1)-picture scalar vertex operators, via
the spectral ow operator mapping the ns sector back to itself [96]:

vaux,ij = lim

zwh(z  w)ei3h v (1)
ns,iji

(6.14)

essentially this is because one gets the auxilliary component by acting on the scalar elds

twice with the spacetime susy current.

for deformations preserving spacetime susy, the internal part of the vertex operators
should be constructed from the chiral ring of the n = 2 algebra.12 this is because the
marginal (0)-picture operators will have vanishing r-charge; thus they may be added to
the worldsheet lagrangian while maintaining n = 2 worldsheet supersymmetry. the
12 or antichiral ring. we will x the overall sign ambiguity of the u (1) charges by demanding

that the boundary operators be chiral.

41

(1)-picture operators will have charge q = 1; the (1/2)-picture ramond operators will
have charge q = 1/2; and the auxilliary elds will have charge q = 2.

we will also want to include bulk vertex operators in order to measure the eects of

the closed-string background. for susy-preserving deformations, we will be interested in

marginal operators in the (c, c) or (a, c) ring. the vertex operators for massless elds can

be constructed from dimension ( 1
2 ) operators (z, z) in the internal sector, with charge
(1, 1) if they are in the (c, c) ring, (1, 1) if they are in the (a, c) ring, and so on. in the
(1) picture these operators are:

2 , 1

v (1)
bulk = e(z)(z)(z, z) .

(6.15)

the (0, 0) picture operators can be constructed via the n = 2 supercurrents which cancel
the u (1) charge, i.e.

v (0,0)

bulk (w, w) =i dzi dzg(z)g(z)(w, w)

for (c, c) operators, and

v (0,0)

bulk (w, w) =i dzi dzg+(z)g(z)(w, w)

(6.16)

(6.17)

for (a, c) operators.

now we wish to calculate the tree-level contribution to the nth order term of the

superpotential; we will expand out the coecients to kth order in the closed string elds.

we are particularly interested in the case n > 2, as we are studying putative moduli. we

will examine the contribution of this term to the fermion bilinear part of the action. on

the disc, we must x 3 real moduli due to the sl(2, ir) symmetry. in addition, we must

absorb the superconformal ghost number violation on the disc. these requirements can be
met by using the (1/2) picture for the two fermionic vertex operators and placing them
at opposite sides of the disc, or equivalently at z = 0 and z =  in the upper half plane.
furthermore we will take one of the ns vertex operators to be in the (1) picture and x
its location between the two r vertex operators, i.e. at z = 1 in the upper half-plane. the

remaining open- and closed-string vetex operators are in the (0) and (0, 0) pictures, and

42

are integrated respectively over the boundary and bulk of the worldsheet. the resulting

amplitude on the disc is:

a = lim

where 2 > 3 > . . . k1, k+2 > . . . > 1, +1 > . . . > n3; this prescription of the
in
limits of integration ammounts to a point-splitting regularization on the boundary.

addition we sum over all orderings consistent with the chan-paton indices; amplitudes

with adjacent operators ij kl are only nonvanishing if k = l. for gauge-invariant

amplitudes we would sum over all such indices and thus over all orderings.

so far we have not specied which of the four chiral rings the closed-string vertex

operators live in. we will discuss below how operators in the dierent rings may or may

not couple to these amplitudes for a given boundary condition.

we will also be interested in superpotential terms which are linear in the superelds

and contain couplings to closed-string moduli, such as the last term in eq. (6.2). this

term will not show up as a fermion bilinear; only the auxiliary eld will in fact couple.

such a term can be computed on the disc with a single closed-string insertion and a single

open-string insertion. sl(2, ir) invariance allows us to x the positions of both vertex
operators. in addition, if we place the closed-string vertex operator in the (1, 1) picture
and the open-string operator in the (0)-picture we have absorbed the superconformal ghost

number violation (the left- and right-moving ghost zero modes will be tied together by the

boundary condition.) the relevant tree-level amplitude is thus:

he (1,1)(z, z)vf,ii(x)i

(6.19)

all of these prescriptions allow us to perform tree-level calculations for xed boundary

conditions in the gepner models. in the rest of this section we will discuss these ampli-

tudes in general compactications as correlators in the topologically twisted version of the

internal cfts. in this language we can revisit our question regarding kahler decoupling

from the superpotential of b-type branes.

43

6.3. topological cft with boundaries

we begin by reviewing and generalizing the discussions in refs. [97,98,99] of topological

cfts with boundary.

topological cfts can be constructed from n = 2 cfts via twisting the stress

tensor with the u (1) current [100]; that is, we dene a new stress tensor:

t top(z) = t (z) 

1
2

j(z) .

(6.20)

note the sign ambiguity; as we will discuss, the overall sign is physically unimportant

but the relative sign between left- and right-moving sectors is physically meaningful. this
twisting may be achieved by adding a charge of c/3 at innity; the change in the stress
tensor is simply the shift derived in the feigin-fuchs construction. in closed string theories

one can see this most simply by adding to the action the coupling of the u (1) current to
a background gauge eld a = 1
2  where  is the worldsheet spin connection [99]. in the
cases we are interested, where j = i3h, the term
2(cid:0)j  + j(cid:1)

z d2z

(6.21)

can be integrated by parts to get a coupling of h to the riemann curvature. for amplitudes

on the sphere, one may use conformal invariance to write the sphere as a at cylinder with

two hemispherical caps. the initial and nal states are created by the path integral on

those caps with any operator insertions one might have there; the curvature on these

hemispherical caps means that the above terms in the lagrangian become the half-unit

spectral ow operators applied to the initial and nal states.

if one constructs the open-string case via the doubling trick on the riemann sphere,

one nds again that the topological twisting is equivalent to an amplitude with half-units

of spectral ow applied to the initial and nal states. more generally, to derive the twisted

theory on a surface with boundary via the above coupling to the background eld, one

must take the boundary contribution inr j  + c.c. into account. if we rewrite the disc as

a long strip with two caps, the background charge will be concentrated on the boundary

of these caps and the result will again be spectral ow applied to the in- and out-states

[99]. care should be taken with any boundary operator insertions on or near this part of

the boundary, as they may have contact terms with the charge insertion.

the relative sign of the twisting of the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic parts of

the stress tensor comes from the relative sign of the background charge. the a-model

44

arises from an axial twisting while b-model arises from a vector twisting [101]. in the

presence of d-branes, the twisting must be compatible with the boundary conditions. we

can see easily that a-type boundary conditions are compatible with the a-model and b-

type boundary conditions are compatible with the b-model, as in each case the twisted

stress tensor satises

t top = t top

and thus satises sensible boundary conditions.

in these twisted models, the conformal dimensions of n = 2 primary operators are
shifted by half their u (1) charge, with the sign depending on the twisting.
in the b-
model, g+ and g+ become dimension-zero scalar grassman operators and suitably
dene brst currents. the ns (c, c) operators are annihilated by them and have dimension
0 with respect to t top. these operators are denoted the topological operators and their

correlators are independent of position, as one can see using the conformal ward identities

in the presence of the background charge. we denote them as the 0-form operators
oi(0). in the closed string theory, we can also dene (1, 0)- and (0, 1)-form operators

izw
iz w

dzg(z)o(0)(w, w) = o(1,0)(w, w)
dz g(z)o(0)(w, w) = o(0,1)(w, w) ,

(6.22)

(6.23)

and 2-form (or (1, 1)-form) operators:

izwiz w

dzdzg(z) g(z)o(0)(w, w)

we can see that the (0)-form operators are simply the internal parts of the (1, 1)
operators of the untwisted theory, while the (1, 1)-form operators are the internal parts of

the (0, 0)-picture operators of the untwisted theory. the operators

i dzo(1,0) ; i dzo(0,1) ; z d2zo(1,1) ,

are brst-invariant on riemann surfaces without boundary. on surfaces with boundary,

the integrated 2-form operator is only brst-invariant up to an integral of the one-form

operators along the boundary, as one can see by integrating by parts; similarly the brst

transformations of the one-form operators pick up boundary terms if the curve of integra-

tion ends on a boundary of d.

one may similarly construct topological operators on the boundary from the chiral pri-

mary boundary operators. from these one may also construct one-form operators from

the commutators or anticommutators of the operator with modes of the spin-2 operators

g:

in the cases that we can construct the boundary condition and boundary operators via the

doubling trick, these can be written as closed-string one-form operators via holomorphic

contour integrals, as above. again, the integral of these operators along the boundary are

brst-invariant, up to potential contact terms with other boundary operators.

one may similarly construct brst-invariant operators in the a-model with a-type

boundary conditions. if the cfts correspond to geometric calabi-yau sigma-models, then

we can see following refs. [101,6] that the open-string a-model describes d-branes wrapped

around special lagrangian submanifolds and the topological closed-string operators are the

kahler deformations of the target space; while the b-model describes d-branes wrapped

around holomorphic cycles, and the topological closed-string operators correspond to com-

plex structure deformations of the target space. note that although refs. [97] discuss only

the case of purely neumann boundary conditions for the b-model, our general discussion

shows that we may couple this topological theory to any supersymmetric, even-dimensional

brane. (mirror symmetry requires this, if we are allowed to discuss any supersymmetric

3-cycle in the mirror). note also that in this geometric picture, the alost-brst-invariance

of the integrated 2-form observables makes sense: a change of complex structure (kahler

class) will change the denition of holomorphic (special lagrangian) submanifolds.

now let us return to the fermion bilinear part of the (n > 2)th order superpotential.

by stretching the cylinder out into the capped strip (g. 1) we may write the amplitude

as the expectation value of some set of ns vertex operators between ramond states; these
states are created by applying the ramond vertex operators to the vacuum. n = 2
worldsheet supersymmetry allows us to write the internal-cft part of these states as the

spectral ow operator applied to ns operators acting on the vacuum;

i(0)|vaci = ei3h/2i(0)|vaci .

(6.25)

the amplitude (6.18) factorizes into three pieces. the rst is the superghost piece; the

second is the two-point function of the spin elds polarized in the spacetime directions.

these give essentially universal answers which we can expect from 4d lorentz invariance.

contribution. r vertex operators on caps can be written as r ground states. b).
representation of r ground state as path integral on half-disc. spectral ow maps
this to ns ground state created by insertion of ns vertex operator.

the internal cft amplitude is the interesting part. it is an expectation value of n chiral

or antichiral ns boundary operators and k bulk ns-ns operators in one of the four closed-

string chiral rings, with two additional half-unit spectral ow operators each mapping

ns states to r states. the xed boundary operators become 0-form observables and the

integrated boundary operators, 1-form observables. if the closed-string operators are (c, c)

for the b-type twisting, corresponding to complex structure deformations, they become

(almost)-invariant topological observables. if they are (a, c) operators, corresponding to

kahler deformations, they are exact with respect to the left-moving brst current and

one might hope that they decouple. we will address this issue below.

the result is (up to the caveats above) a correlator of topological operators in the

topologically twisted theory. the xed operators become 0-form observables and the inte-

grated operators become 1-form and 2-form observables. we may bring the techniques of

topological eld theory to bear on this calculation, and will do so below.

47

similarly, the computation of eq. (6.19) is topological (with the same caveats). here

the auxiliary eld is related by a full unit of spectral ow to the (0)-form observable of

the associated scalar eld. the superghost part of the amplitude merely takes care of the

relevant zero modes. the internal cft part is once again an amplitude in the topologically

twisted theory of a (0)-form boundary observable and a (0, 0)-form bulk observable.

6.4. computations in the geometric sigma model

the topological symmetry of these correlators, and the localization properties of the

topological path integrals [102,101], make the above calculations relatively straightforward.

to see this we will compute the cubic part of the superpotential for a d0-brane in a weakly

curved background, and discuss the linear part of the superpotential for generic wrapped

b-branes.

to begin with we need to construct the relevant topological observables. the closed-

string case has been described in ref.

[101] and the open-string case for fully neumann

boundary conditions has been described in [97]. we need to generalize these results to

arbitrary b-model boundary conditions.

in the untwisted sigma-model, the propagating worldsheet elds are 3 complex scalars
i, and three complex fermions i
. i has u (1) charge 1 and  has charge 1. thus in

the b-twisted theory i have dimension zero and become worldsheet scalars, while  have
dimension one and become worldsheet one-forms. the brst currents g+, g+ give rise to
global symmetries parameterized by constant grassman scalars , (since these are scalars

such constants are well-dened on any worldsheet): in order to write these transformations

in the simplest form, it is convenient to rewrite the fermions as:

i = i

+ + i

+(cid:1) .
  i

 = gi(cid:0)i

(6.26)

if we integrate out the auxilliary elds on the worldsheet, the brst transformations

become

b = 0 .

(6.28)

recall that in the dirichlet directions of the untwisted model, i is xed and i

the (0)-form topological observables in the bulk were constructed in [101]. they are

of the form:

i1...ip

1...q i1 . . . ip1 q ;

(6.29)

 is a -closed (0, p) form with values in qt (0,1)m .

the boundary observables will live on the appropriate holomorphic submanifold c 
in the fully neumann case, the

m and will take values in the chan-paton algebra g.

boundary observables are g-valued (p, 0)-forms, while in the fully dirichlet case they will
be antiholomorphic functions of the position of the boundary, with values in qt (0,1)m g.
in the 2-brane and 4-brane cases, the observables will be forms on c valued in the normal
bundle times the gauge group of the internal worldvolume, nc|mg. the 0-form boundary
observables corresponding to the marginal, chiral primaries of the untwisted model are

linear in the worldsheet fermions. for all of these observables, open and closed, it is easy
to see that the brst operator acts as the holomorphic dierential on c. thus topological
observables are -closed, and trivial brst-exact observables are -exact.

the construction of these topological amplitudes makes it clear that we have some

anomalous u (1) charge. this essentially counts fermion number in these models. in the

closed-string b-model, nonvanishing correlators have fermion number 3 for both  annd 

13 this is a sensible thing to do in the closed-string sector as well, as b-model path integrals

localize onto constant maps into the target space [101].

corresponding to zero modes for each of these elds. on the disc, the boundary conditions

will kill the  zero modes polarized along the dirichlet directions and the  zero modes

polarized along the neumann directions. thus for a holomorphic p-cycle, nonvanishing
correlators will have  fermion number p and  fermion number 3  p.

the other fact that makes these amplitudes straightforward to calculate is that the

topological path integral localizes onto constant maps, restricted to the submanifold dened

by the boundary conditions. the correlation functions are then integrals of the appropriate

forms over the moduli space of constant maps; in these cases they will be integrals of the
pullback of forms on m onto the submanifold c.

let us start by computing the cubic term in the superpotential for a brane sitting at a

point in the cy. the topological boundary observables corresponding to the world-volume

chiral elds will be

where ta is a matrix in the adjoint of the chan-paton group. the correlation function is:

o =

a 2

b 3

c (h12 3i + h213i) tr (tatbtc)

(6.31)

note that the expectation value is antisymmetric in the fermions; thus this will vanish if

there is only one d-brane, after summing over the ordering. the moduli space of constant

maps is a point. chiral deformations of the location by boundary observables live in
t 0,1m and anti-chiral deformations are valued in t 1,0m . the latter are brst-exact

in our picture, so the above correlator is -closed as a function of the location of the
point.14 the correlators must be antiholomorphic functions of the location of this point,
and they live in 3t (0,1)m . serre duality implies that they are components of a closed
antiholomorphic (0, 3) form. on the calabi-yau manifold there is only one such form 

within cohomology. thus the superpotential is

w = 123 f abc1

a 2

b 3
c .

(6.32)

this superpotential is similar to the term coming from fully neumann boundary condi-

tions. the topological string theory in this latter case has been argued to be a holomorphic

six-dimensional version of chern-simons theory [97]; the vertex operators which describe

14 for multiple derivatives there is potentially a holomorphic anomaly.

a  a  a(cid:19)

(6.33)

this second term is the superpotential.

finally, we can look for linear terms in the superpotential coming from a coupling to

closed strings. again, the boundary topological operator will be linear in the worldsheet

scalar fermions; for the correlator to have the right fermion number, the closed-string

operator must be quadratic. we can analyze these couplings for 0-, 2-, 4- and 6-cycles

separately and we nd that some of these amplitudes vanish automatically.

for boundaries living on points, the open-string operator is written in eq. (6.30).

the closed-string operator must be quadratic in  and have no  charge by u (1) charge
conservation. this latter operator is an element of h 0(m, 2t (1,0)m ). by serre duality
this group is equivalent to the dolbeaux cohomology group h (0,1)(m ) which vanishes
for calabi-yau compactications. thus there is no closed-string operator which couples

to a single open-string operator on the d0-brane. the argument is almost identical for
d6-branes and rests on the fact that h (2,0)(m ) is trivial on a calabi-yau manifold.

for 2-cycles the story is a bit richer. if the open-string vertex operator is polarized

along a neumann direction,

vn = ai,aita ,

(6.34)

(we work in a coordinate patch where the tangent-normal split is trivial), then fermion

number conservation requires that the closed-string operator be quadratic in  and there

are no such nontrivial operators as we have just argued. but for vertex operators polarized

in a dirichlet direction, the closed-string operator must be bilinear in  and , making it
a one-form valued in t (0,1)m . serre duality relates this to an element of h (2,1)(m ) and
this group is certainly nontrivial, so these open-closed correlators are allowed. similarly

we can have nontrivial linear terms for chiral elds coming from neumann directions along

a 4-cycle.

indeed, these results should not surprise us. if we change the complex structure of

the manifold, the holomorphic 2- and 4-cycles, and the homomorphic bundles on them,

will change. we should generically nd that the reference cycle is no longer a stable,

supersymmetric conguration. on the other hands, the 0- and 6-cycles are holomorphic

regardless of the complex structure, so we expect them to be supersymmetric so long as
the closed-string background maintains n = 2 spacetime susy.

51

6.5. decoupling of non-topological moduli

one of the more powerful statements one can make in topological closed string theory

is that the kahler (complex structure) deformations decouple from topological amplitudes

in the b (a) model. this is related to the fact that the spacetime of the theory has
n = 2 supersymmetry and the vector multiplets and hypermultiplets decouple (away from
singular points in the moduli space). one can show in the topologically twisted b (a)

models that insertions of integrated (c, a) ((a, c)) operators, which one would get by taking

derivatives of the amplitudes with repect to the kahler (complex structure) moduli, lead to

vanishing amplitudes. in the open string case the status of this decoupling is less clear. to
start with, the spacetime susy is only n = 1 and the lagrangian is far less constrained.
for example, recall the analogous e8  e8 heterotic string, compactied on a cy 3-fold.
there the charged multiplets arising from the kahler and complex structure decouple
from each other at nite order in  [42] but couple due to worldsheet instantons [103].
furthermore, in the generic (0, 2) model it may not make sense to identify deformations

with kahler or complex structure deformations.

actually, a total decoupling is not to be expected, even from geometric consider-

ations. for example, if we consider the theory of d9-branes wrapped on the cy, the

four-dimensional action will come with the prefactor v6/gs where v6 is the volume of the
cy. on the other hand this is a b-brane so the topological amplitudes naturally depend on

complex moduli. thus the strongest conjecture we could make is that the superpotential

(for a b brane) takes the form

w = m(k )w (c, )

(6.35)

where m(k ) is proportional to the brane tension (3.1).

a known example which illustrates this is the one-loop topological open string ampli-

tude. for the d6-brane this is the ray-singer torsion i(v ) associated to the chan-paton

bundle v on m [99]. in general i(v ) is not independent of the kahler moduli, but ratios

ln(i(v1)/i(v2)) are, where v1,2 are two dierent bundles on m [104]. this is consistent

with (6.35); furtermore this amplitude also corresponds to a chiral (r d2) term in the

eective action, the one-loop correction to the gauge coupling.

in a system involving several dierent branes, (6.35) does not even predict a universal

multiplicative dependence of the total superpotential on the kahler moduli. at the very

least it will be the sum of several terms of this form but with dierent m(k ). there will

52

also be terms involving strings stretched between dierent branes. geometrically these

would be expected to come with m(k ) for the surface of intersection; it would be quite
interesting to make a more general proposal along these lines.

in any case, it is preferable to have string world-sheet arguments for decoupling. thus

we proceed to consider the the cubic and quartic terms in the superpotential as computed

on the disk, to see if derivatives with respect to kahler moduli k are consistent with
(6.35). we will work in the untwisted theory in order to ensure that we are not avoiding

any subtleties; our statements can be carried over to the twisted theory.

recall that the cubic term in the superpotential for b-type boundary conditions is

calculated via the 3-point disc amplitude. the part arising from the internal cft is:

hi1

ijoi2

jk i3

kii

(6.36)

plus a sum over any orderings consistent with the chan-paton factors. we may x the

ordering by picking suitable chan-paton factors, which we will do here. now the rst

derivative of this amplitude with respect to some kahler deformation will lead to the above

amplitude with the insertion of an integrated (0, 0)-picture vertex operator constructed

from the (a, c) (or (c, a)) ring:

v =zd

d2wizwiz w

dzdzg+ g(z)i(w, w) ,

(6.37)

and the complete amplitude is show in g. 2. conformal invariance allows us to deform
the integral of g+ out to the boundary. this amounts to using the superconformal ward

identities. let us concentrate on the case where the doubling trick allows us to describe

amplitudes on the upper-half plane via amplitudes on the full complex plane. the contour
may be deformed to a sum of integrals of g+ around each boundary operator15, plus a

contour integral around the image of (see g. 2)

v (0,1)

(a,c) =z d2wi dz g(z)i(w, w)

(6.38)

in the end, the contour integrals around the boundary operators will vanish as the operators

are chiral. the contour integral around the image of the bulk operator in the lower half-

plane may be expressed in the upper half-plane as an integral

(6.40)

where the contour c is shown in g. 2. we get two potential contact terms from this

correlator. one arises from the operator product of the (a, c) operator with the boundary

[14]:

lim
y0

i(x + iy, x  iy)  ci

io

1

y1o o(x)

(6.41)

(here i lables the boundary condition in the region of the contact term); the other from
the operator product of i with the boundary operators , o. note that o will have
zero u (1) charge. let us deal with each of these in turn; we will in fact argue that this

second contact term is taken care of by the rst.

the bulk-boundary ope can be treated as a factorization of the disc amplitude onto

an intermediate open-string state. the ope coecient ci
i will be proportional to the
open-closed disc amplitude hioi. there are in fact two classes of terms to worry about
in eq. (6.41): o < 1 and o = 1. in the former case the intermediate state is a tachyon.
either this is removed by the gso projection, or the perturbation by i has changed the

acceptable boundary conditions  for example by changing the stability condition on vector

bundles  so that the original boundary is no longer a stable d-brane. such a divergence

will have to be removed by perturbing the boundary conditions. the second case is a

more genuine contact term; it is a dimension-one operator which is integrated over the

boundary. in this case the 3-point correlator satises:

(cid:0)i  cbound

(6.42)

if o is a topological operator then the perturbation by i has the fairly simple eect
it should not aect the form of the
of moving the vev slightly along a at direction.

superpotential, in keeping with our claim.

a very similar formula to (6.42) appears in [6]. in that case they nd that by dening

a suitable connection, the chiral primary part of the boundary state of the b-type brane is

covariantly constant with respect to deformations of the kahler moduli. our result should

be the open-string version of this fact.

the second contact term above is between the bulk operator i and boundary operator
o. by using the doubling trick this is described as the coalescence of three operators and,
associativity allows us to write this by taking the bulk-boundary ope (6.41) of  rst, and
then taking the ope of o and o. but this will be included in the limits of integration
of the rst contact term o over the boundary.
55

higher order amplitudes are more subtle since they have a moduli space of insertions

of vertex operators. when applying the ward identities, we will nd integrals of total

derivatives with respect to these moduli, leading to contributions from the boundaries of
moduli space.16 we can already illustrate this phenomenon by looking at the contribution

to the quartic term of the superpotential from a single derivative with respect to the kahler

moduli. the resulting amplitude is:

,0hi,(1/2)(x3)z x3

lim

x2+

2ng + g, oj,(1)(x)o

ok,(1)(x2),(1/2)(x1)z d2wizwiz w

dzdzg+(z) g(z)(a,c)i

(6.43)

plus a potential sum over orderings. as before we may x the orderings of the boundary

operators via a judicious choice of chan-paton factors. once again, we pull the contour
integral of g+ o of the bulk operator and apply the superconformal ward identities.

in addition to the terms which we have already argued to vanish, we get a term coming
from the contour integral of g+ around the integrated ns operator. again, let us look

at the case where we may describe this amplitude via the doubling trick. then the above
anticommutator can be replaced with a contour integral of g around a point on the real
line, and the contour integral of g+ around this leads simply to a derivative of j. the

result is the dierence of contact terms:

lim

0hi(x3)(cid:0)oj(x3  )  oj(x2 + )(cid:1)ok(x2)(x1)
z d2wiz w

dz g(z)(a,c)(w, w)i

(6.44)

in the twisted theory we might hope that factorization and associativity means that this
dierence would vanish. this would be true if there was no insertion of (a,c). with such

an insertion, it is not clear that the amplitude will factorize onto topological intermediate

states, so we cannot complete this argument at present.

the upshot of all of this is that there is a simple world-sheet mechanism which could

lead to decoupling.

it is very analogous to the known decoupling of bulk kahler and

complex structure deformations: the decoupling operator is a descendant with respect to

16 this is similar to the fact that insertions of the stress tensor into correlators on higher-genus
riemann surfaces lead not only to transformations of the operators but to derivatives of the

amplitude with respect to the moduli of the surface [105]. indeed such terms are important in

deriving the one-loop holomorphic anomaly for topological amplitudes [106].

56

an operator which annihilates the boundary chiral elds (say for kahler and b-type, the
operator g+). the situation is better than that for (0, 2) heterotic string models as there
are still two n = 2 algebras involved; they are identied only on the boundary.

such world-sheet arguments are valid up to the possible contributions of contact terms

and to make them precise, one needs to show that the contact terms either vanish or have

simple interpretations (e.g. as connection coecients on the moduli space). we have

interpreted some but not all of these terms and thus can say that we have found further

evidence for decoupling but by no means a proof.

7. correlation functions in minimal models and gepner models

we now turn to the problem of computing correlation functions in the gepner model.

to begin with, let us recall a few properties of gepner model boundary correlators, which

are comparable to properties of bulk correlators. as with correlators in the bulk theory,

in the boundary theory there are restrictions due to ghost number conservation. this can

easily be seen using the doubling trick and has been discussed in the previous section.

in addition, the boundary elds transform under particular representations of the chiral

algebra, similar to chiral halves of bulk elds. the chiral algebra is the tensor product of

the chiral algebras of the minimal models involved. the elds obey the same fusion rules.

correlators forbidden by the fusion rules therefore vanish.

in this section we point out a number of dierences with bulk theory computations

and interpret their consequences.

7.1. ordering eects

correlation functions involving boundary operators require a specication of operator

ordering along the boundary (which we will place on the real line):

h1(x1)2(x2) . . . n(xn)i x1 > x2 > . . . > xn

this ordering corresponds directly to the ordering of the matrix elds in the world-volume

lagrangian: for example terms tr 123 and tr 132 come from these two orderings
of the three-point function.

in some particularly simple models (for example, free eld theory), correlation func-

tions of boundary operators can be analytically continued to the bulk. in this case it is

possible to determine the eect of arbitrary permutations of the elds. this was formalized

57

by recknagel and schomerus [107] in a discussion of non-supersymmetric conformal eld

theories. two boundary operators 1,2 were called mutually local if

1(x1)2(x2) = 2(x2)1(x1)

(7.1)

inside correlators. here, the left hand side implies x1 > x2 and the right hand side x1, x2.
recknagel and schomerus then argued that self-local marginal boundary operators are

truly marginal. the argument is basically that an o.p.e.

(x1)(x2) 

1

x1  x2

(x1) + . . .

of the form which would spoil marginality is incompatible with (7.1).

free fermion correlators can be continued into the bulk as well, and in section 6 we

saw that the superpotentials governing these operators were completely antisymmetric. in

particular they vanish in the theory of a single brane. it seems quite plausible that this

result applies to all operators which are strictly marginal in the large volume limit; however

since we do not know whether an operator we nd at the gepner point is marginal in the

large volume limit until we compute the superpotential (and many interesting operators

are never strictly marginal), such considerations appear somewhat circular.

in general, one does not expect either that boundary correlation functions have a

continuation into the bulk or that the boundary operators have such simple exchange

relations. by general principles (which we review in the next subsection) boundary cor-

relation functions in minimal models and gepner models are particular combinations of

several chiral conformal blocks, each of which has dierent exchange relations, chosen to

be single-valued on the boundary. to make any statement about ordering eects, we must

consider this analysis.

7.2. sewing constraints

in this section we will briey discuss sewing constraints on boundary elds. corre-

lation functions in two-dimensional cft with boundaries have been studied for rational

conformal eld theories in [108,14]. in the bulk, the n-point functions on the sphere are

determined by the three-point functions; the higher-point functions can be computed by

sewing. the result is independent of the deomposition of the n-point function into three-

point functions, as guaranteed by crossing symmetry for the four-point functions. similar

results hold for the case with boundaries. here, we have three types of sewing constraints,

58

those involving only boundary elds, those, involving both bulk- and boundary elds and

those involving only bulk elds. the structure constants for boundary elds depend on

the boundary conditions.

as discussed in section 4, for rcfts the possible boundary conditions preserving all

the symmetries are labeled by the primary elds and can be implemented by boundary

states carrying these labels, and we have written analogous states for gepner models.

the eld content of the theory can be read o from the partition function z; thus the
propagatong elds also carry the labels , . in the case that  6= , the eld  is a
boundary condition-changing operator. if  = , it preserves the boundary condition.

let us concentrate on the correlation functions for boundary elds. the boundary

opes are:


i

(x)

j (y) =xk

c
ijk 

k (y)(x  y)hkhihj + . . .

y < x .

(7.2)

the structure constants c

ijk , together with the vacuum amplitude, determine the three-

point functions:

h

i

(xi)

j (xj)

k (xk)i = c

ijk c

kk1h1i(xi  xj)hkhihj (xj  xk)2hk .

we can also evaluate the correlator in the other channel:

h

i

(xi)

j (xj)

k (xk)i = c

ii 1 c

jkih1i(xj  xk)hihjhk (xi  xj)2hi

(7.3)

(7.4)

the dependence on the coordinates is dictated by conformal symmetry. as mentioned

above, conformal symmetry does not relate three-point functions with dierent orderings.

comparison of (7.3),(7.4) leads to a consistency condition on the structure constants.

in addition to these conditions on the ope coecients, we must demand the crossing

symmetry of the four-point functions. nonvanishing correlation functions for boundary

elds are of the form

1 

2 

h

3 
4 i,

(7.5)

59

























fig. 3: four-point function

as illustrated in g. 3.

in the case of rational symmetric models the factorization

conditions can be made explicit using the conformal blocks. note that for boundary

correlators, the four point functions are linear in the conformal blocks.

in [109] an explicit solution was given for the virasoro minimal models:

c

ijk = fk(cid:20)  
j(cid:21)

i

if we want to compare the four point functions for open string operators with dierent or-

derings, we have to take into account that the change in the ordering will in general require

dierent boundary conditions for the respective four point function to be non-vanishing.

dierent boundary conditions will in general change both the structure constants and the

expectation values of the identity so that we do not expect the four point functions to

agree. in the example of the virasoro minimal model, where we have an explicit solution,

the boundary structure constants satisfy

ijk = c
c
jik .

(7.6)

in particular, they are completely symmetric in the case that there is only one boundary

condition involved. the symmetry of the structure constant is of course a direct conse-

quence of the symmetries of the f -matrices, which are specic for minimal models. (in

general, there will be a phase involved [110].)

another simple example is the u (1) boson. the primary elds are given by tachyon
vertex operators eikx . the vertex operator eikx connects the boundary conditions |nii

60

to |n + kii. therefore, the condition (7.5) is fullled, whenever momentum conservation
holds.

the sewing constraints determining the opes have not yet been solved for n = 2

minimal models or for gepner models. we will return to this in future work.

7.3. boundary selection rules

given two boundary states, |ii, |ii, the partition function will contain the char-
acters of a particular set of marginal operators, whose insertion changes the boundary

conditions from  to . in general, this set of marginal operators will be a subset of all

possible weight one representations, and are determined by the fusion rules [13]. as a con-

sequence, certain correlators remain uncorrected, because the required marginal operator

does not propagate with the particular boundary conditions. as a simple application, con-

sider a boundary condition-changing marginal operator . all non-vanishing correlators
h
3 i containing only boundary changing operators cannot be corrected by inser-
tions of . on the other hand, one can generate a non-zero correlator which vanishes at

2 

1 

lower order.

7.4. three-point functions in the gepner models

a superpotential for massless elds is computed from n > 2-point functions as we have

discussed. let us briey discuss the conditions under which a three point function can be
non-vanishing. to compute a hfi term we start by picking three vertex operators in the
ns sector and we apply spectral ow by one unit to one of them. this is done by splitting

the operators in a charged and an uncharged part as in (6.7) and applying the spectral
ow eih3. this gives the following correlator:

ho

03 ei h3i

01 eih 23o

02 ei h3o

(7.7)

including the ghost contributions, the result is the product of the ope coeent c

123 for the
uncharged operators, with the vacuum expectation amplitude for the boundary condition

. thus, a cubic term in the superpotential is directly proportional to a structure constant
c
123 .

61

7.5. the a1 model

the power of boundary selection rules can be nicely illustrated with the example of the

1 = e

1 = e i3

 and the antichiral operator (0)

a1 model, where all correlators between chiral elds are forbidden. the model contains the
. as discussed in
chiral operators 1, (0)
section 6, from these operators we can derive one-form operators. for the chiral operator,
we get the one-form operator (1)
. alternatively, this operation can be interpreted
as picture changing, if the a1 model is part of a string theory compactication. a candidate
for a non vanishing correlator is h((0)
1 i and we have to check whether it is compatible
with the boundary conditions. we can determine, which boundary conditions allow for
the eld 1 by using the fusion rules. the eld 
 does not vanish.

this is the case for  = 11, 11 and 1 1. as a consequence, our candidate is suppressed
by boundary selection rules.

exists whenever n 1

7.6. the a2 model

in the a2 model, the boundary selection rules do not forbid all correlators. we will
give an example of an allowed correlator, where permutation of the operators requires

dierent boundary conditions.

the a2 minimal model can be seen as one real boson  and one real fermion . the

central charge is 3

2 . apart from the identity there are two more chiral primary elds,

1 = e

22 , 2 = e

there are two corresponding anti-chiral elds of opposite charges.

1 = e i

22 , 2 = e

i
2 .

there is also an uncharged eld , which is the ordinary fermion, or in minimal model

language the eld l = 2, m = 0. the spectrum for various boundary conditions can now

be determined by fusing the elds labeling the boundary conditions.

evaluation of the two four-point functions leads to structure constants with dierent

boundary conditions (which will in general be not equal).

in the nal result, the ex-

pectation value of the identity is taken with two dierent boundary conditions. therefore,

the two results are not expected to agree.

7.7. the models (k = 2)2 and (k = 2)4, (k = 1)3 and (k = 1)9

there are two gepner models containingg only the (k = 2) model: the model (k = 2)2,
which corresponds to a 2-torus; and (k = 2)4, which corresponds to a k3 surface. we
will consider in this section the case of a single boundary condition (i.e.a single brane).

in this case it is known that the superpotential vanishes, which we can check using the
gepner model description. the marginal operator in the (k = 2)2 model is the operator
(1)
2 (2)
2 . this operator corresponds to the complex fermion  in sigma-model language.
we know that this operator is an anticommuting variable. therefore, all superpotential

terms involving this operator vanish in the absence of chan-paton factors, due to the sum
over operator ordering. similarly, as a consequence of the fusion rules, in the (k = 2)4
case all marginal operators are of the form (i)
2 . we know from the torus that these
operators anticommute. therefore, all superpotential terms vanish after summing over all
permutations. this veries the result discussed in section 4.4. for the case ng = 1.

2 (j)

similar statements can be made for the models consisting only of (k = 1) models,
like the torus (k = 1)3 and the orbifolded six-torus (k = 1)9. the fermion in the two-
torus is given by the eld (1)
(1,1,0). simlilarly, we can form three complex
fermions for the six-torus example. the marginal operators propagate for the l = 1

(1,1,0)(3)

(1,1,0)(2)

boundary conditions in these models. again, we know that the superpotential vanishes by

antisymmetry.

7.8. the quintic

let us now turn to the applications of the boundary selection rules to the (k = 3)5

gepner model. we are particularly interested in correlators of marginal operators. for the

b-boundary states discussed in section 5, we found that if we impose the same boundary

conditions on both ends of the string there are boundary conditions with either 101, 50,

24, 11, 4 or 0 marginal operators propagating.

the 101 marginal operators propagating between the boundary states l = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}
are of the same form as the complex structure deformations in the closed string case. these

are left-right symmetric elds of charge (1, 1). if we use the doubling trick, the boundary

marginal operators look the holomorphic part of these operators. they are of the form:

(1, 1, 0)5
(1, 1, 0)3(2, 2, 0)(0, 0, 0)
(1, 1, 0)2(3, 3, 0)(0, 0, 0)2
(1, 1, 0)2(2, 2, 0)2(0, 0, 0)
(2, 2, 0)(3, 3, 0)(0, 0, 0)3

(7.9)

for these boundary conditions there are no further restrictions on possible correlators

from the boundary selection rules. all correlators allowed by u (1) charge conservation

and fusion rules will also be allowed by the boundary selection rules. the dierence from

closed string computations is that these correlators depend on: the one-point function of

the identity in the presence of particular boundary conditions; the values of the fusion
coecients c

ijk for the boundary conditions; and the dierent integration domain for the

four- and higher point functions.

the 4,11, 24 and 50 marginal operators are particular subsets of the 101 operators.

here, restrictions from boundary selection rules are possible: some of the correlators which

are present in the closed string case cannot appear as the operators do not propagate with

the given boundary conditions. we expect the strongest results for the case with 4 marginal

boundary operators.

to compute superpotential terms, we start with three (or more) chiral primary elds

in the ns sector. one way to relate this to a physical amplitude is to apply a unit of
spectral ow, so that from the space time point of view we are computing the hf i term
in the worldvolume lagrangian. for 4- and higher-point functions, charge conservation

requires us to apply the operator g to the additional operators (which changes the label s

64

of the gepner model elds from 0 to 2). in our example, unit spectral ow is implemented
by the operator 5

(3,3,0).

the four marginal operators for the boundary conditions l = {1, 0, 0, 0, 0} are given

by

i = (1)

(2,2,0)(i)

(3,3,0) ,

where the upper index labels the minimal model, i = 2, 3, 4, 5. spectral ow relates these
operators to (1)
(3,3,0). there is no non-vanishing three-point function for
these operators. however, there are some higher-order terms which are allowed. the four

(1,1,0)(i)

(0,0,0)3

point function

h234z

g5i

is not suppressed by the selection rules. we can ask about possible corrections to this

correlator. the fusion rules tell us that all higher order terms have to be of the form

(cid:18)z

gj(cid:19)5

,

since the fth powers of (2,2,2) and (3,3,2) contain the identity in their fusion. note that
there are a lot more correction terms for the coresponding bulk 4-point function.

let us move on to the next most complicated example, the example with 11 marginal

operators. the marginal operators are of the form

(1)
(2,2,0)(i)

(3,3,0), (2)

(2,2,0)(i)

(3,3,0), (1)

(1,1,0)(2)

(1,1,0)(i)

(3,3,0).

(7.10)

compared to the previous case, this example is already much less restricted. for example,

we have in this case two types of three-point functions: those containing each type of

operator listed in (7.10) once; and that containing the three operators of the third type

listed in (7.10). however, a lot of corrections which would be allowed in the corresponding

bulk case are absent for these boundary conditions, because in the factors 3, 4, 5 of the

minimal models, (3,3,0) is the only chiral primary which propagates.

likewise, we potentially get more three point functions for the cases with 24 and 50

operators, and less corrections are suppressed. finally, for the case with 101 marginal

operators, all allowed bulk correlators have a boundary equivalent.

to conclude this section, let us briey commment on the a-type boundary conditions.
here, the l = 1 states have one marginal operator, which is the operator (1)
(1,1,0).
the three-point function between three operators of this type is allowed by the selection

(1,1,0) . . . (5)

65

rules. also, higher-order correlators containing (cid:16)r g(cid:16)(1)

are allowed.
(1,1,0) contains the identity. for the
a-type boundary conditions we have also argued for a coupling of this operator to a bulk

eld. the closed string observables in the a-model are the (a, c) elds. on the quintic,
i=1 (1,1,0)). taking this operator to the
i=1 (1,1,0).

this is the kahler deformation (q5
boundary, we get boundary elds contained in the ope of q5

this certainly makes a bulk-boundary coupling of the desired form possible.

i=1 (1,1,0) q5

i=1 (1,1,0),q5

7.9. consequences of the selection rules

perhaps the simplest conclusion we can draw from these selection rules is that the b
branes with l  1 have non-trivial moduli spaces. consider the example of |10000ib: the
superpotential must take the form

w = 2345f (5

2, 5

3, 5

4, 5

5).

no matter what f is, the subspace 2 = 3 = 0 (or any two s zero) solves w  = 0.

on the other hand, we found that the branes |11111ia, which we identied with
the large volume irp 3s, admitted a superpotential w = 3f (5) + g(5), which would

resolve the potential contradiction with the lack of moduli in the large volume limit. a non-
trivial f and g would break the    r symmetry of the leading order superpotential,
which has no reason to exist in the large volume limit. however we cannot test the

prediction for the number of minima of w at this point.

8. conclusions and further directions

in this work we began a systematic study of d-branes in the stringy regime of the

quintic calabi-yau. our main result was the determination of the charges (in the usual

large volume conventions) of the explicit gepner model boundary states constructed by

recknagel and schomerus. our tools were the intersection form, and the monodromy

and continuation formulas for the cy periods. the techniques clearly generalize to any

calabi-yau given this data.

the primary question we hope to address is whether the spectra and low energy world-

volume theories of branes in the stringy regime are the same (up to renormalizations of

couplings) as in the large volume limit or not. we will refer to this as the geometric

66

hypothesis. unlike the previously studied cases, supersymmetry is not sucient to answer
this question. from the bulk point of view, n = 2, d = 4 supersymmetry allows lines of
marginal stability for bps states, while from the brane point of view n = 1, d = 4
supersymmetry allows transitions from higgs to coulomb branch which are essentially

unpredictable from the large volume point of view.

there are a number of considerations which would lead us to expect non-geometric

phenomena. perhaps the simplest is that the b monodromies relate branes of dierent

dimension. another essentially non-geometric phenomenon is the topology change seen

in various calabi-yaus; both phenomena make the the geometric interpretation of brane

probes ambiguous. the mere existence of these phenomena however does not really con-

tradict the geometric hypothesis as we have stated it, if the dierent geometric objects

related by monodromy and topology change lead to the same low energy theories. what

we would be saying is that the same brane theory can have multiple large volume limits,

a familiar phenomenon in duality.

small instantons and the c3/z3 orbifold provide examples which do contradict the
geometric hypothesis in its simplest form. at a special point (more generally, in complex

codimension one) in moduli space, enhanced gauge symmetry and additional states appear.

this might be considered a relatively mild failure as it is associated with a singularity of

the riemannian geometry or gauge bundle. if all failures of the geometric hypothesis were

associated with singularities, conversely it would be true under the mild condition that

the geometry stayed non-singular. as we mentioned in the introduction, we can imagine

much more drastic failures  a priori, the spectrum of branes at the gepner point might

have satised none of the relations we expected from geometry and gauge theory.

the results we have presented here are not (yet) inconsistent with the geometric

hypothesis. most of the branes we nd could certainly correspond to the appropriate geo-

metric constructions  holomorphic vector bundles and special lagrangian submanifolds.

for example, all of the branes we found satised the (mathematical) stability condition

on vector bundles. the lack of any classication of these makes it dicult for us to assert

that branes which we did not identify actually do not have geometric constructions. the

elliptically bered case may be more promising in this regard. the most problematic case
was a brane which would correspond to a rank 1 bundle with c1 = 0 but c2 6= 0. although
such things do not exist in conventional gauge theory, they are known to exist in modied

gauge theories (such as noncommutative gauge theory), so one can imagine that this object

has a description in the large volume limit.

67

we also presented a general argument that b-type branes should be described by

geometric considerations  namely, that their world-volume potentials are determined by

quantities in b-twisted topological models, which are equal to their classical values in the

b-twisted topological sigma models, up to hopefully minor eects of kahler deformations.

besides a formal world-sheet argument we showed that many known cases t with this

idea. by contrast, the superpotentials in a brane theories can depend directly on kahler

moduli and a priori it would seem much more likely that the geometric hypothesis fails.

finally, we made some rst steps towards explicit computation of the superpotentials

on these branes. these superpotentials appear to be quite non-trivial and it appears that

such computations are doable with existing techniques; we will return to this in future

work. an exciting possibility is that topological open string theory can be developed to

the point where exact superpotentials can be obtained, perhaps with some analog of the

special geometry determining the bulk prepotentials.

one important direction to develop is to nd more direct ways to get the geometric

interpretation of these states. the results here suggest that this will be simpler in the

a picture  the simplest picture is that each component minimal model has a specic

boundary condition for its lg supereld. if we had the d0-brane boundary state, we could

apply a probe construction to get the geometrical picture for the b boundary states (indeed

we could derive the corresponding (0, 2) models); perhaps larger classes of boundary states

containing the d0 can be found.

a study of curves of marginal stability is in progress, to decide whether the large vol-

ume and gepner d-branes should be expected to match up, and whether new phenomena

appear near the conifold point.

let us close with a brief discussion the physical relevance of our primary question.

to the extent that branes in the stringy regime are qualitatively dierent than geometric

branes, all of the work on compactication using branes will have to be reconsidered. on

the other hand, to the extent that they are qualitatively the same, these techniques will

provide new ways of deriving geometric results, such as the existence and moduli space

dimension for vector bundles.

questions of existence of branes are also directly relevant for non-perturbative con-

structions of m theory. for example, matrix theory constructions to date use d0-branes as

their starting point. compactications on some manifold m are believed to be described

by d0-branes in a certain scaling limit of type iia string theory on m [111]. the authors

of ref. [112] argued that for calabi-yau compactications this limit was the mirror of the

68

conifold point. if it were to turn out that the d0-brane did not exist in the stringy regime,

this construction would have to be reconsidered.

in any case we believe there is much to be discovered in this direction.

appendix a. an explicit calculation for a-type boundary states

this appendix shows the explicit calculation of the intersection number of two a-type
boundary states. the witten index tr r(1)f in the open string sector is obtained from
the transition amplitude between the (internal) rr parts of the boundary states with
(1)fl inserted17. the rst part of this calculation is very close to that in [7].

for the a-type boundary states the a constraint is trivial, as we have discussed.
