abstract

boundary operators and boundary ground states in sine-gordon model with a xed boundary
condition are studied using bosonization and q-deformed oscillators.we also obtain the form-factors
of this model.

1 introduction

an integrable two-dimensional eld theory possesses an innite set of mutually commutative integrals of

motion.for the massive theory,this results in the factorizable scattering both in bulk case (i.e without

a boundary ) and in the case with an integrable reecting boundary (e.g. eld theories dened upon

the half line ) [1,2,3,4] .in the boundary case ,besides the two particle scattering s-matrix, there exists

boundary reecting r-matrix,which describes the process of particle reecting at the boundary. the

r-matrix must be consent with the s-matix (namely, r-matrix must satisfy the boundary yang-baxter

equation[2,29,30]).the calculation of the exact factorized s-matrix and r-matrix may be performed by

combining the standard requirements of unitarity and crossing symmetry together with the symmetry

properties of the model [1,2].

in the bulk case,the two particle s-matrix uniquely species the structure of the space of local operators

for an integrable model.its knowledge can be used to calculate o-shell quantities,like correlation functions

of elementary or composite elds of the integrable models under investigation.these quantities can be

obtained by considering the form-factors of local elds,which are matrix elements of operators between

asymptotic states[5,6,10].it is shown that the general properties of unitary, analyticity and locality lead to

a system of functional equations on form-factors.these equations include s-matrix elements as structure

constants and are enough for the resconstruction of the form-factors (see also [10][11][12]).therefore, the

s-matrix determines the whole elds in the bulk case.obtaining the form-factors, one can in principle

obtain all the o-shell quantities of the eld theory.we next introduce these equations for the form-factors

of any local operator in the massive integrable model without boundary.it is shown that the form-factors

for any local eld o

f (1, ...., n)  h0|oz(1)....z(n)|0i

are subject to a series axioms[10,12] as the following:

1.riemann-hilbert problem

sij(i  j)f (1, ..., i, ..., j, ..., n) = f (1, ..., j, ..., i, ..., n)

f (1, ..., i, ..., n1, n + 2i) = f (n, 1, ..., i, ..., n1)

in eq.s(1),(2), we use the usual conventions [10,12] : s() is a two particle s-matrix and matrix c is

related to the crossing symmetry of s-matrix ;the number of (o, ) is the mutual locality index for

the local operator o with respect to the elementary eld  [12].therefore,solving the equations (1),(2)

plays a very important role in the massive integrable model without boundary.there are two ways to solve

the equations (1),(2).the rst one is to directly solve the dierence equations of q-deformed knizhnik-

zamolodchikov (kz) equations[10] (q-deformed kz equations are equivalent to equations (1) and (2)

),which can be considered as a generalization of bpzs work in two dimensional conformal eld theories

(cft) [15].in this way,smirnov obtained the form-factors of some local operators for su(2)-invariant

thirring model (su(2)-itm),sine-gordon (sg) model and o(3)-nolinear -model[10,35]. smirnov and

reshetikhin discussed some properties of the restricted sg model[18]. the second way is by bosoniza-

tion.in the second way ,following the success of the bosonization in cft [16,17,18,19] ,much attention has

been focused on the vertex operators of some q-deformed ane lie algebra which satisfy q-deformed

kz equation [21,24,38].using these vertex operators,one can obtain the bosonization of massive integrable

eld models and solvable lattice models [23,39,12].this method can be considered as the generalization of

bosonization in cft[16,17,19,20] and may be a very powerful and ecient method.using this bosonization

method , one can get the general integal representations for form-factors in su(2)-imt,sg and xxz

model[12,25].

although much progress has been obtained in the massive integrable model without boundary (in

the bulk case),the progress of massive integrable model with integrable boundary condition is still very

few.recently,ghoshal and zamolodchikov [2] proposed boundary crossing relation to determine the scalar

factor of the boundary reecting matrix (r-matrix). in the boundary case,it is s-matrix and r-matrix that

uniquely specify the structure of the model under investigation.from the s-matrix and r-matrix,jimbo

et al obtained the general integral representations of form-factors for xxz model with an integrable

boundary (a xed boundary condition),and found that form-factors for this model satised an analogues

of dierence equation[26] which has only a subtle dierence from the bulk case.some solution to these

equations in the xyz model with boundary was already obtained[26]. in this paper, we use the method of

bosonization for integrable model to study the sg model with a xed boundary condition, which has been

proved to be integrable[2,3,4,30,31].it is the extension of lukyanovs work,which only deals with sg model

without boundary (in the bulk case),to the integrable boundary case.however,this method can also be

extended to other boundary integrable models[36].we nd that in the boundary case of massive integrable

quantum eld theories,the form-factors also satisfy some dierence equations which are quite similar to

the solvable lattice model.these functional equations are enough to reconstruct the form-factors as in the

bulk case.

this papper is organized as follows.in sect.2 we give a brief review of sg model without boundary

(bulk case) by lukyanov which will be used in the following section.boundary operators with the bosonic

version will be studied in sect.3,from these boundary operators we obtain the boundary bound ground

states and nd the reecting matrix for the quantum breathers with these bound states.in order to

calculate the form-factors, the boundary operators with the q-deformed oscillators expression is given in

sect.4. then, the form-factors are represented in the term of general integrals in sect.5. thus in principle

we can obtain all the quantities of the sg model with an integrable boundary.

and its particle spectrum consists of a kink-antikink pair (z, z+) ( with equal masses ) and a number of

netural particles bn ( quantum breathers ) whose number is dependent on renormalized coupling con-

) is taken such that it

encloses only the poles originated from the action of v , (v

) on the right-hand state |vi clockwise [12].



in addition to the exchange relation of (5) and (6),the operator product of particle-creation operators

za() has the following singular properties [12] when 2 approaches 1 :

iza(2)zb(1) =

ca,b

.

(8)

from the bosonic representation (7) and its regularized version (see sect.4), lukyanov got the form-factors

of sg model in the bulk case.

3 boundary operators in the bosonic version

now let us consider sg eld theory with an integrable boundary at x=0, which is described by the action

[2,4]

(9)

it has been proved that the boundary sg model (9) is integrable[2,3,4] and the asymptotic particle states

are generated by the same set of creation operators za() as in the bulk case in the following way [2]:

|za1 (1)za2 (2)....zan (n )ib = za1 (1)....zan (n )|bi .

(10)

but now the vacaum state |0i is replaced by the |bi , which is the ground state of sg model with a

boundary.the state |bi satises the relations

zi()|bi = rj

i ()zj ()|bi

.

(11)

if such |bi exists,the consistency of (5) and (11) leads to the boundary yang-baxter equation and the

unitary relation

r2(2)s12(1 + 2)r1(1)s21(1  2) = s12(1  2)r1(1)s21(1 + 2)r2(2)

r()r() = 1

(12)

which in turn guarantees the integrability of the model[2,3,4,29,30,31]. supplied (12) with the boundary

crossing relation given by ghoshal and zamolodchikov[2]

(13)

one can determine the exact boundary reecting matrix r() upon to some cdd ambiguity.this

ambiguity can be cancelled by some dynamical requirement[1,2]. thus the crucial problem is to nd the

ground state |bi .for this purpose we rst obtain a r-matrix satisfying all the requirements (12) and

(13).

in this paper,we only consider the diagonal solution to (12) and (13),which corresponds to the xed

boundary condition |x=0 = 0 (or to the case of m   in the action (9) )[2,4].

in this special

case,minimal solution r() (which has the minimum poles in the physical strip ) reads

r() = r()

we nd that this solution is the same as the diagonial solution (k=0) of ghoshal and zamolodchikov[2]

if one use the folllowing transformation :

1


  , i   ,   i( +

1
2

)

.

the diagonal solution (14) has one formal parameter  which can be related to the physical parameter

0 in the lagrangian [2,37].

we then assume that the boundary ground state |bi and its dual state hb| can be expressed by

|bi = e|0i

,

hb| = h0|e+

(14a)

where e is called the boundary operator and e+ is the dual operator of e .similar to the xxz

model with a reection boundary[25],we need further

hb|z 

i () = hb|z 

j ()rj

i (), where z 

i () = c a

i za(i + ), c =(cid:18) 0 1

1 0 (cid:19) .

(15)

in order to study the properties of the operators ,we rst introduce the following decomposition

of the bosonic elds () and 



()

() = +() + 0() + (), 









() = 

+() + 

0() + 

()

,

6

where () , 

() , 0 and 





0 satisfy the following relations[12]

+()|0i = h0|() = 0 ,

[0, 0] = 0 ,

[0, ()] = 0 ,

[(1), (2)] = 0,

[+(1), (2)] = lng(2  1) ,

[

(1), 

(2)] = 0 ,





[

[

0, 

()] = 0,



(2  1) .

actually, () (

()) are proper limit of regularized bosonic eld  (

 respectivly ), and 0 (

0)







is the limit of zero mode of regularized one.the regularized bosonic elds will be discussed in the section

4.

now let us make the ansatz for  :

[, everthing] = 0 ,

[(), everything] = 0 .

(16)

substituting the above ansatz into the equations (11) and (15) for i=+ in (11) and i=- in (15) ), we nd

that  and  can be determined by

from direct caculating and using the denition of the ()

then we must check the consistence of our ansatz for the second equation of (11) and (15) i.e. i=- for

(11) and i=+ for (15) ).using the explicit form of z() in (7) and (17),(18), we nd the second equation

of (11) is equivalent to the following equation

but not the poles in  i 

a corresponding new contour c

2  
2 +  (n  0) .we change the integration parameter  to  ,and with
,we still get the same integral as the lhs of (19).we nd that the

can be deformed to the same as c. adding this integral to

which is symmetric under    .using the same method,it is easy to check that the second equation

of (15) also has the same symmetry under    .thus,the boundary operator of xed case is

obtained,if (16) can be satised for some  .it will be shown that such  can be obtained in section

4 when one takes the limit of regularized operators  as   0.

to study the boundary bound states introduced by ghoshal and zamolodchikov, we now analyze

the physical poles (in the physical strip 0 < im() < ) of the reecting matrix r() .poles of r0()

(19a)

term (in eq.(14) ) are associated with breathers and do not correspond to the boundary (new) bound
states. the other poles of r1() term correspond to the boundary bound states. for  
( which is corresponding to ghoshal and zamolodchikovs 0    

2  im()  0
2 in ref.[2]),there is no pole in the
and

 ] ,two series of poles appear in the physical strip :   il

physical strip. for 0 < im()  [ 1
i+il (0  l   ,  = [ im()



]) .the structure of physical poles is the same as the results of skorik

and saleur et al in ref.[4],where some semi-classical explanation of boundary bound states was given.

the i   + il series correspond to the cross-channel poles of kink and antikink reecting at the

boundary.hence we need only to study the bound state corresponding to the poles   il and denote

them by |bi(+l) . using the boundary bootstrap methods[2],we can obtain the corresponding boundary

reecting matrices r(l)(),which describe the reection between kink or antikink and the boundary bound

with these r(l)() , one can construct the corresponding boundary bound states |bi(+l) and hb|(+l) by

the same method as that we already use to construct |bi and hb| from r(). on the other hand,due

to |bi(+l)

(hb|(+l)) being the bound states of |bi

(hb|) with an incoming particle ( kink ) carrying

rapidity   il ,they can be obtained through the following way

|bi(+l) = res=ilz+()|bi ,

hb|(+l) = res=ilhb|z 

+() .

(20)

the boundary bound state has been discussed also by saleur and skorik et al in ref.[4] and ref.[40].

the r() and r(l)() (0  l  ) describe the reection of kink and antikink with the corresponding

boundary.however, there exist other particles  breathers bn (0 < n  [ 1

 ]) in sg model.the breathers

are considered as the bound states of kink and antikink pair and are dened as following

expressed in the term of bosonic elds () and () . fortunately,in order to calculate form-factors in

the bulk case ,lukyanov introduced some regularized eld () and 

() ,which can be expanded into
an innite sum of q-oscillator mode [12].in this papper,with the helps of q-oscillator expansion of () ,

we can obtain the explicite form of regularized boundary operators  in terms of the q-oscillators.this

not only proves the existence of  but also permits one to calculate the form-factors in the regularized

version.after   0 ,the form-factors of sg model with xed boundary are obtained (see sect.5).in the

following of this section ,we will give boundary operators in term of q-oscillator (the regularized bosonic

eld itself has a very important meaningit is related to the bosonization of xyz model[14,26],and has

some relation with the deformed virasoro algebra[14,32,33,34] ).

the bosonic elds () and 



() in sect.2 cannot be expanded into an innite sum of oscillator

modes as the usual free elds does.however, we can perform an oscillator realization by the ultraviolate

regularization introduced by lukyanov [12] .to do this,the rst thing is to introduce a regularization

parameter  such that  

    

 and then consider regularized elds () and 

() which can



be expanded by the q-oscillators.then the bosonic elds () 



() can be viewed as proper limit of

() 

() as   0 .the oscillator expansion of the regularized bosonic elds are [12]

the reection matrix r() in (14) can be viewed as the limit of the regularized one in (21a). the

similarly,the regularized versions of vertex operators v(), v 

 can be
constructed and v () ,v () , , are the limit of their regularized counterparts when   0. in the

 (),screening operators , 

regularized version,vertex operators, the screening operators and the boundary operators are all expanded

by the q-oscillators.replacing  ,() , 0 (0  q ) by  ,() , q in (16),one nd that (16) is

satised after taking the limit   0 .the  and  are the same as (17a) because the limit of (23)

is equivelent to (17). we thus prove the existence of  and complete the construction of the boundary

states |bi and hb| .

5 form-factors in the boundary sg model

our nal goal is to obtain the form-factors of sg model with boundary.in principle,these form-factors

enable one to calculate all quantities of this quantum eld theory[5,6,10,12] .a form-factor is a matrix

element of a local eld operator between two asymptotic states

f (1, ...., n) = hb|oz(1).....z(n)|bi

.

the problem of description of all the local operators can be considered in the framework of ref.[12] and

ref.[23] .the solution to this problem is  a local operator is everything commuting with the type ii

operators (or the asymptotic generators) [23]. for sg model,lukyanov [12] already got this solution : he

got three generator function operators of local operator s() s = (1, 0, 1)

v

in sect.2. using the exchange relation (6), one can nd that m() satisfy the following relations with

.

(25a)

the particle-creation operator za()

m()za() = (1)mza()m()

.

(25)

thus,in sg model with a boundary a form-factor can be expressed as by multipoint functions of the

generator functoin operators s (s=-1,0,1)[12] and the particle-creation operators za (a=+,-), between

ground state |bi and its dual hb| .we can alternatively dene the form-factors as

f m1,...,mk

a1,...,an (1, ..., k|1, ..., n) =

hb|mk (k)....m1 (1)zan (n)....za1(1)|bi

hb|bi

.

(26)

using exchange relations (5) ,(25) ,the reection properties (11) ,(15) and the singular properties (8)

,one can nd that the form-factors in the boundary case dened above satisfy the following dierence

equations and the residue condition (cf eq.(1) and (2)), which are quite similar to the equations appearing

in the solvable lattice model with integrable boundary[26]:

1.riemann-hilbert problem.

(the rst equation is the result of exchange relation (5),the second one is the result of reection property

(11), and the last one is the result of eq.(15). )

2.residue condition.

(it is the result of singular property (8) with (5) ,(11) ,(15) ,(25). ) there are additional poles corre-

sponding to bound particle (breathers) and the boundary bound states.for the poles corresponding to

breathers, the residue relation are the same as in the bulk case[10]. however, the poles corresponding to

boundary bound states is dependent upon the boundary condition. for the xed boundary case which

we study in this paper, the form-factors between the bound state |bi(+l) and its dual states hb|(+l) can

be directly obtained by the residue form as follow

hb|(+l)mk (k)....m1 zan(n)....za1 (1)|bi(+l)

=

res=ilhb|z 

+()mk (k)....m1 zan(n)....za1(1)z+()|bi
res=ilhb|z 

+()z+()|bi

.

(29)

the above analogues of dierence equations and residue condition also appear in other intergrable eld

theories with integrable boundary,e.g., in su(2)-itm with an integrable boundary [36].

from the equation (27),one can obtain the quantum boundary knizhnik-zamolodchikov (kz) equation

(30)

like the bulk case,the system of functional equations (27),(28),(29) permit the reconstruction of the

form-factors of boundary massive integrable model. in other word,the equations (27),(28),(29) can be

considered as the starting point to construct the form-factors of massive integrable model with integrable

boundary.in this direction,some works have been given[26]. but the method of bosonization become more

powerful and ecient.we will calculate the form-factors directly from the expressions of |lambdas , za

and hb| ,|bi via q-oscillators.in this way, as we already prove,the main functional equations (27),(28),(29)

13

are the direct results of the exchange relations (5) ,(25) , reection properties (11) , (15) and the singular

properties (8).

the procedure is as folows.we have obtain the bosonic representation of the operators za() , m()

and  , which make (5) ,(8) ,(11) ,(15) ,(25) satised.after substituting the bosonic representation of

s() ,za() in (25a) (7) into (26),we nd that the form-factors (26) (or solutions to equations (27) (28)

(29) ) can be given by the combination of multiply contour integrals as the following

(32)

since the boundary operators  can not be explicitely expressed in the term of bosonic eld () and
(),it is dicult to get the function r(1....k|1....p|1....n|1....r). fortunately,it can be viewed as

the limits of their regularized counterparts r(1....k|1....p|1....n|1....r) which can be obtained by



changing


v () , v

() , v () , v () ,  to


v  () ,

() , v() , v () ,  can be expanded into the q-oscillator (in sect.4), we rst move e to the left
of all vertex operators and reach the right side of e+ .then we insert a complete set of coheret states (38)


() , v() , v () ,  in (26). because


v  () , v

v

between e+ and e and we can obtain the exact form of function r(1....k|1....p|1....n|1....r)
using the gauss type integration formula (40)[25]. after taking the limit of   0 , we nally obtain the

14

exact form of function r(1....k|1....p|1....n|1....r) (see appendix for details):

therefore,we obtained the form-factors of sg model with a xed boundary condition,which is ex-

pressed in terms of integrals ((31)).this is quite similar to the correlation functions in cft[19,20] and the

form-factors in massive integrable model without any boundary[10,35],they are also expressed in terms of

integrals.

6 discussion

let us summarize our resluts.we have shown that the obtained form factors of semi-innite line sg

theory with a xed boundary obey the quantum boundary kz equation( (27),(28),(29) ).the quantum

kz equation is a simple consequence of the exchange relation of zf algebra and the reection properties

(11),(15) of the boundary ground state and its dual.it is believed that these quantum dierence relations

should govern the form-factors in the integrable eld theories with integrable boundary as the classical

kz equation does in cft.

in this paper,we only consider sg theory with xed boundary condition which corresponds to the di-

agonal solution to the boundary yang-baxter equation.to solve sg theories with other generic integrable

boundary condition is a challenging work;when the coupling constant  is equal to some special value

( = 1

n ) ,which may be related to th restricted sg model, it is worthy of further studying .we hope to
present the full results eslewhere. the connection between the symmetries of sg model and deformed

virasoro algebra is also worth of investigating.

appendix

a.1

in this appendix, we rst calculate the regularized function r(1....k|1....p|1....n|1....r) using the

q-oscillator expansion of vertex operators and the boundary operators in sect.4 .then taking the limit of

  0 ,we obtain the function r(1....k|1....p|1....n|1....r) .

using the exact form of  in (23) ,one can nd that e has the eect of a bogoliubov transfor-

17

mation

e ane = an

, n > 0

e ane = an  an + m ,

n > 0 .
