abstract

a conformal eld theory on the boundary of three-dimensional asymptotic anti-de sitter
spaces which appear as near horizon geometry of d-brane bound states is discussed. it is
shown that partition functions of gravitational instantons appear as high and low temper-
ature limits of the partition function of the conformal eld theory. the result reproduces
phase transition between the anti-de sitter space and the btz black hole in the bulk gravity.

introduction

to understand thermodynamics of black holes [1, 2] is important because it provides us some
insight of quantum gravity. the most simple derivation of thermodynamics of black holes is
given by the euclidian quantum gravity approach [3]. we consider a semiclassical partition
function in path-integral approach to quantize gravity as

zsemi. = eie [g0].

(1.1)

where g0 is a metric of an euclidian black hole and ie[g0] is the euclidian action. if we
regard this partition function as a statistical mechanical partition function, we can obtain
thermodynamical variables. the entropy is given as

s =

a
4g

,

(1.2)

where a is the area of the event horizon and g is the newton constant. it is natural to
think that the entropy of black holes have some microscopic origin. however, the euclidian
quantum gravity approach has no explanation about the microscopic origin because of its
thermodynamic nature [4].

the microscopic derivation of the entropy of black holes can be given in terms of string
theory [5, 6, 7]. in this article, we study the d-brane bound states which constructed from a
d5-brane, a d1-brane on t 4s1. the d5-brane wraps four-cycle in t 4 and s1 q5 times and
the d1-brane wraps zero-cycle in t 4 and s1 q1 times. the kaluza-klein momentum is added
in the direction along s1. the bound states give ve-dimensional reissner-nordstrom black
holes when compactied on t 5. the thermodynamical entropy is given by (1.2). on the
other hand, the moduli of the bound states can be described by the d1-brane worldvolume
theory, and it becomes a two-dimensional superconformal eld theory in low energy. the
superconformal eld theory is a nonlinear sigma model whose target space is a deformation
of a symmetric product of k  q1q5 copies of t 4
,

(1.3)

(t 4)k
s(k)

where s(k) is a permutation group of k elements. because this target space has dimension
4k, the superconformal eld theory has central charge c = 6k. the level, say, n of the states
of the superconformal eld theory is xed by the kaluza-klein momentum. because gravity
knows only the level, the state has large degeneracy in microscopic viewpoint when n  c.
the entropy becomes the same as (1.2) for extremal or near extremal black holes.

recently, it was conjectured that the large n gauge theory on the boundary of a product
space of anti-de sitter space (ads) and some compact manifold corresponds to supergravity
this argument holds only for nonextremal black hole in the euclidian quantum gravity approach. this

point will be discussed in section 2.

or string theory on the bulk [8]. one of the most tractable example of this conjecture is
given by d-brane bound states which was discussed above. the near horizon geometry of the
d-brane bound states become a product space of the btz black hole and s3  t 4 [9]. the
btz black holes are quotient spaces of ads3 and reach ads3 asymptotically [10]. it is known
that spaces which reach ads3 asymptotically have conformal symmetry at innity [11], and
its extension to superconformal symmetry is also discussed [12]. the superconformal eld
theory on the boundary has central charge c = 3/2g3 = 6k, which is the same as that of
the d1-brane worldvolume theory, where  is the characteristic radius of ads3 and g3 is the
three-dimensional newton constant. because of this correspondence, we may consider the
two conformal eld theories are the same [9]. the conjecture is translated into the large c
superconformal eld theory can be described by the bulk gravity and vice versa. indeed, the
microscopic derivation of entropy of btz black holes is given in terms of this conjecture [13].
let us recall that the semiclassical partition function (1.1) has only the contribution of
a black hole. however, in semiclassical approximation, contributions must come from all
metrics of euclidian solutions which are consistent with a given boundary condition [14]

zsemi. = xg0inst.

eie [g0].

(1.4)

these euclidian solutions are called gravitational instantons. for example, let us consider
a system at an inverse temperature  contained in asymptotic ads4 [15]. continued to the
euclidian metric, the boundary has topology s1  s2, where s1 corresponds to the imagi-
nary time with identication. one of the gravitational instantons which ts this boundary
condition is euclidian ads4 whose imaginary time is identied with the period . it has
topology s1  r3, where s1 corresponds to the imaginary time. the euclidian anti-de
sitter-schwarzschild black hole at inverse temperature  is another solution which ts the
boundary condition. it has topology r2  s2, where r2 corresponds to the plane whose
angular coordinate is the imaginary time.

the semiclassical partition function becomes

zsemi.[] = z ads

semi.[] + z bh

semi.[].

(1.5)

the anti-de sitter-schwarzschild black hole has a maximum inverse temperature 0 = 24,
where 4 is the characteristic radius of ads4. the anti-de sitter-schwarzschild black holes
whose inverse temperature is lower than 0 have positive specic heat and it is stable at
least locally, contrasting to asymptotic at schwarzschild black holes. the anti-de sitter-
schwarzschild black holes whose inverse temperature is lower than 1 = 34 have lower eu-
clidian action than that of ads4. when the inverse temperature is lower than 1, the global
minimum of the euclidian action of the system comes from the anti-de sitter-schwarzschild
black hole. we can regard this phenomenon as thermal phase transition between the anti-de
when the inverse temperature becomes so low, the thermal equilibrium with radiation becomes

2

sitter space and the anti-de sitter-schwarzschild black hole. this phase transition of the
bulk gravity can be interpreted as the large n phase transition, or connement of the large
n gauge theory on the boundary [16].

in this article, we discuss the phase transition of asymptotic ads3 and construct the
partition function of the conformal eld theory on the boundary, which was pointed out
in [9]. the phase transition of the bulk gravity is reproduced in terms of the partition
function of the conformal eld theory.

2 euclidian quantum gravity

it is known that the extremal reissner-nordstrom black hole has no entropy because of a
topological reason in euclidian quantum gravity approach [17, 18, 19, 20]. we briey review
the reason and discuss this point for the extremal btz black hole.

let us consider thermodynamics of reissner-nordstrom black holes. the reissner-

nordstrom metric is

ds2 =  1 

2gm

r

+

gq2

r2 ! dt2 + 1 

2gm

r

+

gq2

r2 !1

dr2 + r2d2
2,

(2.1)

where q is the electric charge of electromagnetic elds and m is the adm mass of the black
hole. the radii of horizons are r = gm  (g2m 2  gq2)1/2, where r are those of the
outer and inner horizon respectively. the rst law of thermodynamics of reissner-nordstrom
black holes is

dm =


2

da
4g

+ +dq,

(2.2)

where  is the surface gravity, + is the scalar potential at the event horizon and a is the
area of the horizon respectively. we see that + may be regarded as the chemical potential.
we write the action in the hamiltonian form in terms of adm formalism [19, 21]. the
euclidian metric is obtained by an analytic continuation of the metric (2.1) which is given
by the replacement

t 7 i.

(2.3)

we identify the imaginary time with a period . we take two boundaries: the one is s1s2,
where s1 is the imaginary time and s2 is the two-sphere at innity. the other is s1  s2,
where s1 is the imaginary time and s2 is the event horizon. the euclidian action for the
euclidian metric over a region m, which is the bulk of two boundaries, has the form

ie =

1

16g zm

d4x(cid:16)ij hij  n h  n ihi(cid:17) + iematter + b,

(2.4)

impossible.

3

where b is the boundary term which is discussed below, and iematter is the euclidian action
for matter elds.

to discuss thermodynamics of black holes, we are interested in the variation with respect
to m and q, because the euclidian action should be constructed so that it has an extremum
on the solution. in the variation, we must x the thermodynamical conjugate variables. for
the variation being well dened, we must add the boundary term b to cancel the unwanted
boundary terms. the total boundary terms should be xed as

b = m  +q 

a
4g

,

(2.5)

for the nonextremal black hole. the rst term is needed to the variation at innity with
respect to m and the second term is needed to the variation at the horizon with respect to
q. the third term needs more explanation. the near horizon geometry of the nonextremal
black hole has topology r2  s2, where  is the angular and (r  r+) is the radial coordinate
of r2. in general a conical singularity sit on the origin of r2. the variation of the euclidian
action at the horizon leads [18]

1
4g


2

a,

(2.6)

where  is the proper angle at the horizon. we must x the boundary term such that the
euclidian action has an extremum on the solution with no conical singularity at the horizon.
thus we must add third term in (2.5). on the other hand, the near horizon geometry of the
extremal black hole has topology r  s1  s2, where  is a coordinate of s1 and there is no
conical singularity to avoid. this fact means that there is no need to add the third term in
(2.5).

the bulk parts of the euclidian action vanish when constraints hold, and the euclidian
action has the boundary terms only. when we identify the semiclassical partition with the
grand partition function of statistical mechanics, we obtain the free energy

f = m  +q 

1


a
4g

,

(2.7)

for the nonextremal black hole. thus, the entropy of the nonextremal black hole is given as
(1.2), and the inverse temperature is given as  = 2/. these results are consistent with
(2.2). for the extremal black hole, we obtain free energy

f = m  +q,

(2.8)

and the entropy of the extremal black hole vanish nevertheless the area exists. moreover, the
fact that we can identify the imaginary time of the extremal black hole in any period because
of the topological reason implies that the extremal black hole can be in equilibrium with a
thermal bath at any temperature. the fact that the entropy changes discontinuously in the

4

extremal limit implies that one should regard a nonextremal and an extremal black hole as
qualitatively dierent objects [17]. however, as mentioned in section 1, the entropy of the
extremal black hole obeys the same relation (1.2) microscopically as nonextremal black hole.
this discrepancy was discussed in [22, 23, 24].

let us consider thermodynamics of btz black holes, which emerges as the near horizon

geometry of the d1-d5-brane bound states [9]. the btz black hole metric is

where the squared lapse n 2 and the angular shift n  are

ds2 = n 2dt2 + n 2dr2 + r2(cid:16)d + n dt(cid:17)2

,

(2.9)

r2
2 +

(8g3j)2

4r2

,

n 2 = 8g3m +
8g3j
n  = 
2r2 ,

(2.10)

where m and j are the mass and angular momentum respectively. the three-dimensional
newton constant g3 is given by the compactication and it becomes /4k. the rst law of
thermodynamics of btz black holes is

dm =


2

da
4g3

+ +dj,

(2.11)

where a is the circumference of the event horizon.  and + are the surface gravity and the
angular velocity of the horizon respectively.

the euclidian metric is obtained by an analytic continuation of the metric (2.9) to

imaginary t and j [25]. the continuation is given by the replacement

7 i,
t
j 7 ije,

(2.12)

where je is xed by the lorentzian angular momentum as je = j. note that the contin-
uation of the angular momentum to the imaginary value is necessary for the metric to be
real. this is physically sensible, since the angular velocity is now a rate of change of the real
angle with respect to the imaginary time [26]. the euclidian metric becomes

ds2 = n 2

ed 2 + n 2
(r2  r2

e dr2 + r2(cid:16)d + n

(2.15)

the radius of the outer horizon of the euclidian black hole is r+.
it is important that
the radius of the inner horizon of the lorentzian black hole is continued to the imaginary
value. this fact means that the euclidian black hole has only one horizon. thus the
euclidian extremal black hole which is obtained from the lorentzian extremal black hole
with the analytic continuation (2.12) does not have degenerate horizon, namely it has the
same topology r2  s1 as that of nonextremal euclidian black holes.

following the same procedure described for reissner-nordstrom black holes, we get the

total boundary terms of the euclidian action as

b = em + ee+je 

ae
4g3

,

(2.16)

where e is the period of the imaginary time and e and ae are the angular velocity and
the circumference of the event horizon respectively. these values are dierent from the
lorentzian values. moreover, this expression holds for the extremal black hole, contrasting
to reissner-nordstrom black holes. the semiclassical partition function becomes

z btz

semi = exp(cid:18)em  ee+je +

ae

4g3(cid:19) ,

(2.17)

but this expression itself does not reproduce the relation (2.11). thus, to derive the grand
partition function of thermodynamics, we must apply analytic continuation of the angular
momentum je again to the semiclassical partition function (2.19) as

where j is the original lorentzian angular momentum. the grand partition function is given
as

je 7 ij,

(2.18)

z btz = exp(cid:18)m + +j +
+2! ,

= exp  22

2g3

4g3(cid:19)

(2.19)

where  is the inverse temperature which is given from e by the continuation (2.18). the
temperature is given as t = /2 and the entropy agree with the relation (1.2). these
expressions hold even for the extremal black hole. these results are consistent with (2.11).

6

the partition function of ads3 can be obtained in the similar way. the semiclassical

partition function of ads3 is given

z ads

semi. = exp  e

8g3! .

by the continuation (2.18), the grand partition function becomes

z ads = exp(cid:18) 1

8g3t(cid:19) .

(2.20)

(2.21)

because the euclidian action proportional to the inverse temperature, the entropy vanishes.

3 ads3 gravitational instantons

euclidian ads3 is the upper half-space of h 3, and has an isometry sl(2, c). we introduce
the poincare coordinates which is useful to observe the identication by discrete subgroup
of the isometry,

ds2 =

2
z2 (dx2 + dy2 + dz2) =

2
z2 (dwd w + dz2),

z > 0,

(3.1)

where w  x + yi. the action of sl(2, c) can be expressed in terms of quaternion

q  x + yi + zj.

the sl(2, c) action becomes

q 7 (aq + b) (cq + d)1,

h =   a b

d!  sl(2, c).

c

(3.2)

(3.3)

the metric of the btz black hole (2.13) can be constructed as a quotient of h 3 [25]. we

introduce left and right euclidian temperature te as

e =

te
e+

we introduce coordinates

exphte+( + i ) + te(  i )i ,

(3.5)

7

where  <  <  and r > r+. these coordinates are also available for the extremal
black hole except the massless black hole, contrasting to the lorentzian black holes [10]. to
make the coordinate  into a true angular coordinate, we must identify    + 2. this
identication is given by the identication

w  exp(42te+)w,
z  exph22(te+ + te)i z.

(3.6)

the identications implied by thermal ensemble are automatically taken into account as

   +

.

(3.7)

note that the euclidian btz black hole whose imaginary time identied has topology r2 
s1, i.e. a solid torus, where (r  r+) and  are the radial and angular coordinates in r2
respectively. the direction of the imaginary time is a contractible loop of the solid torus,
and the core is a circle which represent the horizon. it means that we have only anti-periodic
fermion in the time direction. the boundary at innity, i.e. z = 0 is a torus. it is useful to
introduce the modular parameter of the torus

m 

i

2te+

e+
2te

=

i

2te

.

we introduce coordinates of the torus as

i
2

 

log w = te+(i   ),

and the identication (3.6) and (3.7) are given by the modular parameter as

   

1
m

,

    1,

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

respectively.

we construct the euclidian ads3 with the identication (3.7). we introduce coordinates

w =   r2
z =   2

r2 + 2!1/2
r2 + 2!1/2

exp(cid:18)
  i(cid:19) ,
exp(cid:18)
(cid:19) ,

(3.11)

where we regard  , r and  as imaginary time, radial and angular coordinates respectively.
using the coordinates, the metric (3.1) becomes

ds2 =  1 +

r2

2! d 2 + 1 +

r2

2!1

dr2 + r2d2,

(3.12)

8

the identication (3.7) means

w  exp  1
z  exp(cid:18) 1

te+! w,
te(cid:19) z.

(3.13)

note that the euclidian ads3 whose imaginary time identied has topology r2  s1, where
r and  are the radial and angular coordinates in r2 respectively. the direction of the
imaginary time is a noncontructible loop of the solid torus. it means that we have periodic
or anti-periodic fermion in the time direction. the boundary at innity, i.e. z = 0 is a torus.
the coordinates of the torus becomes

 =

i

2 (cid:18)

  i(cid:19) ,

(3.14)

and the identication (3.13) and    + 2 are given by the modular parameter (3.8) as
(3.15)

   + m ,

   + 1,

respectively.

it is remarkable that the two boundary tori of the euclidian black hole and the euclidian

ads3 are related with the s-transformation of the modular transformation:

s : m 7 

1
m

.

(3.16)

in other words, if we have a boundary torus of a euclidian ads3 with modular parameter
m , by applying the s-transformation, we get the boundary torus of the euclidian black hole
at the same temperature. however s-transformation is the dieomorphism of the boundary
torus, it exchanges the contractible and the noncontructible loops in the bulk. we may also
introduce the t-transformation of the modular transformation:

t : m 7 m + 1.

(3.17)

if we have a boundary torus of a euclidian black hole whose modular parameter is  
m 
1/m , by applying the t-transformation, namely  
m + 1, we get the same boundary
torus of another euclidian black hole. this boundary torus is obtained by applying dehn
twists around the contractible loop of the boundary torus of the original euclidian black
hole. this transformation corresponds to

m 7  

(r+,|r|) 7 (r+,|r| + ).

(3.18)

this interesting symmetry of a boundary torus was found in [25].

let us consider thermodynamics in asymptotic ads3 [9, 27]. the boundary of a system
at an inverse temperature  in asymptotic ads3 has topology t 2 when continued to the

9

euclidian metric. because this system involves angular momentum, we x the boundary
condition by not only te but also e+ as grand canonical ensemble. one of the gravitational
instantons which t this boundary condition is an euclidian ads3 whose imaginary time is
identied. it has topology of a solid torus. its semiclassical partition function (2.20) can be
written as

z ads

semi.[m ] = exp"

ik
2

(m  m )# .

(3.19)

the euclidian btz black hole is another solution which ts the boundary condition. it also
has topology of a solid torus. its semiclassical partition function (2.17) can be written as

z btz

semi.[m ] = exp"ik

2 (cid:18) 1

m 

1

m(cid:19)# .

(3.20)

note that these two gravitational instantons are related by the s-transformation. this
fact is not surprising, because we discussed above, when we have a boundary torus of an
euclidian ads3 with a modular parameter m , this torus is a boundary torus of euclidian
black hole whose modular parameter is 1/m . in other words, we have at least two solid
tori which t the boundary torus. moreover, when we have a boundary torus of the euclidian
black hole, applying the s1ts-transformation, we get the same boundary torus of another
euclidian black hole, but the bulk gravitational instanton (3.20) is invariant. this symmetry
is the same as that of (3.18). the gravitational instanton (3.19) is invariant under t-
transformation.

inspired by these symmetry, we suspect that for each modular parameter m there are

an sl(2, z) family of gravitational instantons [9] with partition functions

exp"

ik

2  am + b
cm + d 

a m + b

  a

and these can be constructed beginning with the identications on h 3 by

h =   exp(cid:16)i am +b
cm +d(cid:17)

0

!  sl(2, c).

following this conjecture, the semiclassical partition function can be represented as

zsemi.[m ] = xfamily

exp"

(3.21)

(3.22)

(3.23)

which has the modular invariance. to derive the grand partition function, we must apply
analytic continuation of the angular momentum (2.18) to the semiclassical partition function.
the grand partition function becomes

z[t, +] = xfamily

exp"

8g3   ia + 2t+b

(3.24)

where t are given from euclidian left and right temperature by the analytic continuation
as

1

t

.

(3.25)

this expression includes the grand partition functions of ads3 (2.21) and that of the black
hole (2.19). the expression (3.24) includes unknown gravitational instantons which give
imaginary grand partition functions. the grand partition function (3.24) reaches that of
ads3 in low temperature limit and that of the black hole in high temperature limit. because
the btz black hole has positive specic heat, it is stable at least locally. in suciently low
temperature the black holes decays into ads3 and suciently high temperature ads3 decays
into the black hole. we can regard this phenomenon as phase transition between ads3 and
the black hole. this phase transition becomes sharper when k is large [9].

for the extremal black hole, the partition function is also given by (2.19), and the behavior
+2 reaches
of (2.19) may seem unclear because as t reaches zero, at the same time, 1  2
zero. however, we see that the extremal black hole does not dominate. this fact means that
the extremal black hole is unstable, and decays into ads3 [28].

4 conformal field theory on the boundary

the class of boundary conditions which keep asymptotic ads3 generates conformal sym-
metry on the boundary [11]. the generalization to ads3 supergravity [29] was discussed
in [12]. for ads3 we have four anti-periodic killing spinors, two for each two-dimensional
irreducible representation of the gamma-matrices. we have the super-virasoro algebra for
each representation with central charge c = 3/2g3. the super-virasoro algebra implies
bounds for the zero modes of virasoro generators. we regard ads3 as the ground state
which satises both bounds:

k +
0 |0n sil = 0,
k 
0 |0n sir = 0,

(4.1)

where k 
neveu-schwartz (ns) vacuum.

0 are the zero modes of the virasoro generator. let us call this ground state as

for the massless black hole, we have two periodic killing spinors, one for each two-
dimensional irreducible representation of the gamma-matrices. we have a set of the ramond
type super-virasoro algebra. the ramond type super-virasoro algebra implies bounds for
the zero modes of virasoro generators. we regard massless black hole as the ground state
which satises both bounds as

l+
0 |0ril = 0,
l
0 |0rir = 0.

11

(4.2)

let us call this ground state as ramond (r) vacuum. for the extremal black hole, we have
one periodic killing spinor. it means that the state which correspond to the extremal black
hole is killed by, say, the right-moving supercharge.

the above discussion of the ground states leads us to impose a relations between the

eigenvalues of the generators and the mass and angular momentum of black holes:

for ns-sector. with these relations, we nd that r vacuum have m = j = 0 and states of
the extremal black hole satises m = |j|. we also nd that ns vacuum has m = (8g3)1
and j = 0.

let us recall that the btz black hole is emerged as the near horizon geometry of the
metric of the d-brane bound states. the conformal eld theory lives at innity which
emerges from the asymptotic symmetry and the d1-brane worldvolume theory have the same
central charge using the relation c = 3/2g3 = 6k. when we consider these two conformal
eld theories are identical, we expect that we can interpret thermal phase transition of the
bulk gravity in terms of the conformal eld theory. we have expectation that the partition
function of the conformal eld theory is the same as that of bulk gravitational instantons [16].
let us consider euclidian conformal eld theory lives on the complex plane with coordi-

nates w. the action of the global sl(2, c) on w is

this identication is consistent as nite temperature conformal eld theory. inspired by the
sl(2, z) family of gravitational instantons, we set the partition function on the torus to be
modular invariant. unfortunately, the exact partition function of the conformal eld theory

12

on (1.3) is unknown, but we can expect that to observe the phase transition it is enough
to use that of free theory. when we have a bosonic sector only, the partition function
becomes modular invariant. however, we have a fermionic sector. because the modular
transformation mix the boundary condition for fermions, we must add spin structures on
the torus to keep the modular invariance [30]. in our discussion it is enough to take four
sector of the spin structure: (+; +), (++; ++), (;), (+;+), where + and 
referring to periodic or anti-periodic respectively, and the rst pair of signs referring to left
movers and the second pair of signs to right movers, and the rst sign in each pair referring
to the behavior in the  direction and the second referring to the behavior in the  direction.
the total partition function becomes modular invariant. we denote the partition functions
of each sector as ze+, ze++, ze and ze+ respectively.

the partition functions are given as

this function is the contribution from bosons and invariant under both of s-transformation

this partition function is invariant under s-transformation, and not invariant under t-
transformation. in the nite temperature eld theory, the boundary condition for fermions
are automatically imposed to be anti-periodic. to derive the partition function whose
fermions are periodic, we use the fermion number operator ()f . the partition function
of (+;+) sector becomes

the reason why this partition function vanish is that the degenerate r vacuum have fermion

we have obtained four sectors of the partition function and they relate with each other
by the modular transformation. a construction of the partition function of the conformal
eld theory on the boundary of the btz black hole was discussed in terms of su(2) wzw
model [31]. in this article, we have construct the partition function of the conformal eld
theory from another point of view. the partition function of the euclidian conformal eld
theory is the sum of these partition functions

zecft = ze+ + ze + ze+.

(4.16)

14

in the following discussion, we observe our expectation that the partition function is the
same as that of bulk gravitational instantons, namely

zecft = zsemi..

(4.17)

to obtain the grand partition functions, we apply the continuation of the angular mo-
mentum (2.18) to the partition functions of the euclidian conformal eld theory. this
continuation is given by

(4.18)

let us consider the nonextremal situation, namely 0  + > 1. to observe the
behavior of partition functions in low temperature, we expand partition functions around
the point

in low temperature limit, the partition functions of each sector reach

ql = qr = 0.

(4.21)

(4.22)

it is interesting that the partition functions of gravitational instantons emerge in this limit.
we nd that z+ gives the partition function of the massless black hole and z and z+
gives the partition function of ads3. moreover, a spin structure of the conformal eld theory
restrict the spin structure of bulk instantons [16]. as stated in section 3, ads3 admit both
spin structure in the time direction and anti-periodicity in the spatial direction. this fact
is consistent with the result that z and z+ give the partition function of ads3. the
massless black hole admits anti-periodicity in the time direction and periodicity in spatial
direction. this fact is also consistent with the result that z+ gives the partition function
of the massless black hole.

to observe the behavior of partition functions in high temperature, we expand partition

functions around the point

we discard logarithmic contributions.

ql = qr = 1.

(4.23)

15

we introduce the parameter for convenience

ql = exp(cid:16)42t+(cid:17) ,
qr = exp(cid:16)42t(cid:17) .

we nd that z+ gives the partition function of the massless black holes, and z+ and
z gives the partition function of the black hole. it is interesting that both of z+ and
z give the partition function of the black hole. it means that black holes do not have
supersymmetry, and admit both spin structure in the spatial direction. moreover, these two
sectors are related by the s1ts-transformation.

we can obtain the microscopic entropy from the partition functions (4.26) and (4.27) as

this reproduce the entropy (1.2) correctly. this saddle point evaluation is available when
nl, nr  c, namely g3m  1. the same argument holds for z.

in low temperature limit z dominates and it reproduces partition function of ads3 and
in high temperature limit z+ or z dominate, and they reproduce the partition function
of the black hole. these phenomena reproduce the phase transition of the bulk gravity as
expected.

let us consider the extremal limit where + = 1 and t = 0.
parameter qr reaches zero. on the other hand, the parameter ql reaches

(4.35)

thus, when g3m  1 we have another limit than low temperature limit. we have interest
in this limit. to observe the behavior of partition functions in this limit, we expand partition
functions around the point

in this limit, the partition function of each sector reaches

(4.40)

(4.41)

(4.42)

we nd that z+ gives the partition function of the extremal black holes and z+ gives
the partition function of ads3. z also gives the partition function of ads3 in this limit,
namely the rst factor dominates. in this limit z dominates and it reproduces the parti-
tion function of ads3. this fact reproduces that the extremal btz black hole is unstable,

17

and decays into ads3. however, there seems to be an inconsistency that the microscopic
entropy of z is the same as that of the extremal black hole because of the behavior (4.38),
nevertheless ads3 has no entropy in euclidian gravity approach. this inconsistency may
needs further investigations.

5 discussions

we have discussed ads3 gravity in euclidian quantum gravity approach. we constructed the
semiclassical partition function which includes all members of the sl(2, z) family of gravita-
tional instantons. in high temperature limit the black hole dominates and in low temperature
limit ads3 dominates. this phenomenon was regarded as thermal phase transition.

we constructed partition function of a conformal eld theory on the boundary of ads3
gravity. inspired by the sl(2, z) family, we constructed the partition function such that
sl(2, z) invariant in accordance with the spin structure. the construction of the partition
function of the conformal eld theory on the boundary of black holes have been considered in
terms of su(2) wzw model in [31]. our interest was that whether the partition function of
the conformal eld theory on the boundary reproduce not only the behavior of black holes,
but also the thermal phase transition in bulk gravity. we have discussed the thermal behavior
of the conformal eld theory which is obtained as low energy eective theory of the d1-brane
worldvolume theory using the partition function of free theory. more rigid discussion of the
thermal behavior needs to understand the partition function on the deformation of the
symmetric product.

it was shown that the partition function of the nonextremal black hole and that of
ads3 emerge as high temperature and low temperature limit of the partition function of the
conformal eld theory respectively. these results reproduce the phase transition in the bulk
gravity. in the extremal limit, the partition function of the conformal eld theory becomes
the form of the partition function of ads3. it is consistent with the fact that the extremal
btz black hole is unstable thermodynamically. however, the microscopic entropy from the
partition function of the conformal eld theory seems to exist. this phenomena may need
further investigation.

let us recall the correspondence between ads5 gravity and the conformal eld theory
on the boundary which was discussed in [16]. we have two gravitational instantons; the
one is ads5, and the other is anti-de sitter-schwarzschild black hole. the anti-de sitter-
schwarzschild black hole does not admit periodicity of fermions in the time direction, the
phase transition occurred in the partition function whose periodicity of fermions are anti-
periodic in time direction, namely

z ads

semi. + z bh

semi. = treh

(5.1)

18

in the correspondence between ads3 gravity and the conformal eld theory which was dis-
cussed in this article, we have four sector of the partition function of the conformal eld
theory because of the spin structure. as shown above, it seems that the partition function
z reproduces ads3 in low temperature and the black hole in high temperature, however
z itself is not modular invariant. thus, in this article, we consider the correspondence of
modular invariant partition functions

zsemi. = zecft

(5.2)

where the left hand side is the sum of the family of gravitational instantons and the right
hand side is the sum of the three sectors with dierent spin structure. to investigate the
intermediate region of temperature, which is nontrivial in terms of both of gravitational
instantons and conformal eld theory, may make clear the correspondence.
