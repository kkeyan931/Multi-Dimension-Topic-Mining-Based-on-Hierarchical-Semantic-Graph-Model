abstract

dierential realizations in coordinate space for deformed lie algebras with three gener-

ators are obtained using bosonic creation and annihilation operators satisfying heisenberg

commutation relations. the unied treatment presented here contains as special cases all

previously given coordinate realizations of so(2, 1), so(3) and their deformations. applica-

tions to physical problems involving eigenvalue determination in nonrelativistic quantum

mechanics are discussed.

1. introduction:

lie groups and their associated algebras are extensively used in the analysis of the symmetry

properties of physical systems. for example, realizations of so(2, 1) have been used to obtain

the eigenvalues of many quantum mechanical problems. recent studies show that coordinate

realizations of nonlinear lie algebras may also be interesting in determining eigenspectra of

certain physical problems in an algebraic approach [1]. the main purpose of this paper is to

set up a unied approach for obtaining dierential realizations in one and two-dimensional

coordinate space for nonlinear lie algebras with three generators.

the deformed lie algebras which we consider are described by

[j3, j+] = j+,

[j3, j] = j,

[j+, j] = f (j3) .

(1)

j  j1 ij2 are the well known raising and lowering operators. f (j3) is an arbitrary analytic
function of the operator j3. note that the special choice f (j3) = 2j3 corresponds to so(3)

and f (j3) = 2j3 corresponds to so(2, 1). in terms of the cartesian generators j1, j2, j3, the
commutation relations are

[j1, j2] =

i
2

f (j3),

[j2, j3] = ij1,

[j3, j1] = ij2 .

(2)

the plan of this paper is as follows. in sec. 2, we review some simple general properties of

lie algebras. in sec. 3, we describe how to obtain realizations of eq. (1) in terms of bosonic

creation and annihilation operators (a and a) satisfying heisenberg commutation relations

[a, a] = 1. although we are using the conventional notation a and a for these operators,

they do not necessarily have to be hermitian conjugates of each other. appendix a contains

a discussion of specic one-dimensional realizations of the heisenberg algebra. in particular,

it is shown that realizations involving derivatives higher than the rst can all be reduced to

rst and zero order. sec. 4 contains a description of one-dimensional coordinate realizations of

the lie algebra given in eq. (1). we show that our unied approach reproduces all previously

known realizations in the literature [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. two-dimensional coordinate realizations are

described in sec 5, along with some applications involving eigenvalue determination for some

nonrelativistic quantum mechanical potentials.

2. some properties of the lie algebra:

for completeness and to establish notation, we describe some properties of lie algebras.

2

some are well-known, but others are new.

(i) the function f (j3) characterizes the lie algebra given in eq. (1). for subsequent work,

it is convenient to dene the function g(j3) as follows:

f (j3)  g(j3)  g(j3  1) .

(3)

for example, for so(3), f (j3) = 2j3 and one gets g(j3) = j3(j3 + 1). it is easy to check that

the function g(j3) is not unique - any periodic function of unit period can be added while

maintaining eq. (3). note that the casimir operator for the lie algebra of eq. (1)is given by

c = jj+ + g(j3) = j+j + g(j3  1) .

(4)

this observation is useful for many physical applications. for instance, we use it in sec. 5 for

eigenvalue determination.

(ii) the operators j+ and j satisfy the important property

t (j3)j+ = j+t (j3 + 1) , t (j3)j = jt (j3  1)

(5)

for any analytic function t (j3). this property is extensively used in obtaining realizations.

(iii) if operators j+, j, j3 satisfy the standard so(3) lie algebra, so do operators j+, j, j3

dened by jm = pn mmnjn provided the matrix m satises m t m = 1 and det m = +1.

note that the elements of the matrix m do not have to be real, but if they are, the matrix is

orthogonal. this property is very useful in relating all the so(3) realizations currently available

in the literature.

(iv) given operators j1, j2, j3 which satisfy the so(3) lie algebra, one can nd operators

k1, k2, k3 which satisfy a more general algebra

[k1, k2] = iq3k3,

[k2, k3] = iq1k1,

[k3, k1] = iq2k2 ,

(6)

by choosing k1 = q2q3j1, k2 = q3q1j2, k3 = q1q2j3. in particular k1 = ij1, k2 =
ij2, k3 = j3 is a realization of so(2, 1).

(v) given operators j+, j, j3 which satisfy the standard so(3) lie algebra, one can nd

operators j+, j, j3 which satisfy the deformed algebra of eq.

(1)[7]. these operators are

given by

j+ = j+a(j3, c) ,

j = b(j3, c)j ,

j3 = j3 ,

(7)

where c = jj+ + j3(j3 + 1) is the casimir operator of so(3). the form of the operators in
eq. (7) was chosen so that the two conditions [ j3, j] =  j are trivially satised. in order

3

to satisfy the third condition [ j+, j] = f ( j3), one needs functions a(j3, c), b(j3, c) which

satisfy the following condition:

a(j3  1, c)b(j3  1, c)[c  j3(j3  1)]  b(j3, c)a(j3, c)[c  (j3 + 1)j3] = f (j3) . (8)

if a(j3, c) and b(j3, c) commute, this condition reduces to

h(j3, c)[c  j3(j3 + 1)] = g(j3) + p(j3) ; h(j3, c)  a(j3, c)b(j3, c) ,

(9)

where p(j3) is an arbitrary periodic function of period unity. it is important to realize that

only the product h(j3, c) is xed by the above constraint equation, but not the individual

functions a(j3, c) and b(j3, c). given eq. (7), it is sucient to restrict our attention to

realizations of so(3) in order to obtain realizations of any deformed lie algebra with three

generators.

note that for the special case of so(3) itself, the choice p(j3) = c gives h(j3, c) = 1. the

simplest choice of factors a(j3, c) = b(j3, c) = 1 reproduces the initial so(3) realization,

whereas a more general choice b(j3, c) = a1(j3, c) yields a new realization. furthermore,

other choices of p(j3) give additional new realizations of so(3).

in particular, the choice

p(j3) = 0 gives the realization

j+ = j+

j3(j3 + 1)

c  j3(j3 + 1)

,

j = j ,

j3 = j3 ,

which diers from the original one only in one generator j+. this freedom in choosing the

periodic function p(j3) is analogous to gauge xing in eld theories.

an interesting nonlinear example using the above formalism comes from the choice g(j3) =

3 (j3 + 1)2 and p(j3) = c 2. this choice gives the realization
j 2

j+ = j+[c + j3(j3 + 1)]

,

j = j ,

j3 = j3 ,

(10)

for the deformed lie algebra corresponding to f (j3) = 4j 3
3 .

3. realizations of the deformed lie algebra in terms of bosonic operators:

in this section, we develop a procedure for obtaining realizations of the lie algebra dened

by eq. (1) in terms of bosonic creation and annihilation operators a and a which obey the

heisenberg algebra commutator ha, ai = 1. the number operator is dened by n  aa. it
follows that hn, ai = a,

(m = 0,1,2, . . .).

(11)

[n, a] = a. more generally,
[n, am] = mam ,

hn, ami = mam ,

4

to generate realizations of a deformed lie algebra using the operators a, a, n , we choose

the following ansatz:

j+ = p f (n ),

j = g(n )q,

j3 = n + c ,

where c is a constant. p and q are functions of a and a chosen to satisfy the property

[ n , p ] = p,

[ n , q ] = q .

(12)

(13)

clearly, from eq. (11) and eq. (13), it follows that two possible choices for p (a, a) are a and

1/a and two possible choices for q(a, a) are a and 1/a. in fact, one can choose the linear

combination

p = 1(n )a + 2(n )

1
a

, q = 1(n )a + 2(n )

1
a .

(14)

using eq. (13), it is easy to show that p n m = (n  1)mp , n mq = q(n  1)m, so that one
has the property p t (n ) = t (n  1)p , t (n )q = qt (n  1) for any analytic function t (n ).
also, the dependence on a and a of the products p q and qp clearly comes only through the

combination aa = n .

our ansatz of eq. (12) will satisfy the conditions of eq. (1) provided

f (n  1)g(n  1)p q  g(n )f (n )qp = f (n + c) .

if f (n ) and g(n ) commute, and the above condition becomes

h(n  1)p q  h(n )qp = f (n + c) , h(n )  f (n )g(n ) .

(15)

(16)

it only remains to determine h(n ) from eq. (16). as in sec. 2, note again that the functions

f (n ) and g(n ) do not appear separately but only appear as their product h(n ). also, note

that in sec. 5, we will discuss a situation where f (n ) and g(n ) do not commute.

4. one-dimensional coordinate realizations:

here we consider one-dimensional coordinate realizations for a, a such that [a, a] = 1.

eqs.

(12), (14) and (16) now immediately give a realization for the nonlinear algebra of

eq.

(1). as an example we consider the same deformed lie algebra with f (j3) = 4j 3

3 as

in section 2. we make the simple choice p = a = x, q = a = d/dx, c = 0 which gives
p q = n, qp = n + 1, n = xd/dx. eq. (16) now reads: h(n  1)n  h(n )(n + 1) = 4n 3
whose solution is h(n ) = n 2(n + 1). taking g(n ) = 1 our coordinate realization is:

d
dx

+ 1(cid:19) , j =

d
dx

, j3 = x

d
dx

.

(17)

5

j+ = x(cid:18)x

d

dx(cid:19)2(cid:18)x

general coordinate realizations of a, a are discussed in appendix a. any of these can be

used to generate dierent one-dimensional realizations of deformed lie algebras. our formalism

is very exible since there is freedom in choosing a, a (appendix a) and the operators p, q in

eq. (14). furthermore, once h(n ) has been determined from eq. (16), one has various choices

for factorization into the functions f (n ), g(n ) which appear in the nal realization given in

eq. (12). our formalism contains as special cases all the coordinate realizations published in

the literature. we shall now illustrate this statement for specic realizations discussed in [4]

and [2].

filho and vaidya [4] have discussed physical applications based on the following represen-

tation of so(2, 1):

j+ = 2

d2
dy2 

2
y2

, j =

y2
8

, j3 = 

y
2

d
dy

,

(18)

where  is an arbitrary constant. in order to obtain this realization as a special case of our
formalism, we choose a, a by taking  = 0, h(y) = 1/y2, r(y) = y2/4 in eq. (25) in appendix
a. this gives

a = 

y3
2

d
dy 

y2
4

, a =

1
y2 , n = 

y
2

d
dy

.

furthermore, choosing p = a , q = 1/a in eq. (14), implies that the constraint (16) on

h(n ) reads

h(n  1)  h(n ) = 2n.

the solution is h(n ) = n (n + 1) + , where  is an arbitrary constant. choosing the

factorization g(n ) = 1/8 and f (n ) = 8h(n ), eq. (12) with c = 0 and  = (3  4)/16 after
simplication gives the filho-vaidya realization of eq. (18).

another example of a dierential realization of the so(2, 1) algebra was given by barut and

bornzin [2]. their expressions for the generators are:



y +

1

t1 =

yn  yn! , t2 =

2 y2n
n2 p2
here py = iy1 d
dy y, n is an arbitrary positive integer and  is an arbitrary constant. to
make contact with our formalism, using (iii) from section 2, we rst rotate t1, t2, t3 to the

n  1

n2 p2



yn + yn!.

new operators j1 = it3, j2 = t1, j3 = it2. this gives

next, let us take  = 0, h(y) = yn and r(y) = [n(2c  1)  1]/(nyn) in eq. (25) of appendix
a. this implies

a =

further, choosing 1 = i, 2 = 1 and 2 = 1 = 0 in eq.

(16) of the form h(n ) = b2n 2 + b1n + b0 with b2 =  i
eq.
 i
2 (cid:2)(2c + 1)2/4    1/(4n2)(cid:3). finally, the factorization h = f g with f = 1, concludes the
proof that eqs. (19) are a particular case of our formalism. note that the initial rotation of

2

(14), we nd a solution of
, b1 = i 2c+1

and b0 =

2

generators seems to be essential in getting the realizations of [2].

similarly, our formalism also gives the one dimensional realizations described in refs.

[3]

and [6].

5. two-dimensional coordinate realizations:

in this section we will introduce realizations of so(2, 1) using two coordinates. in contrast

to the one coordinate realizations, we now allow the functions f and g appearing in eq. (12)

to be functions of n as well as an internal coordinate x and its derivative d

dx . it is important
to observe that due to this generalization, the functions f and g no longer commute with each

other, and as a result, equation (15) must be used.

to construct explicit realizations of so(2, 1), we choose p = a = exp(i) and q = 1

a =
exp(i), i.e. 2 = 1 = 0 in eq. (14). the simplest choice of the operator a which satises
h a , ai is a = i exp(i) 
 . as a simple example, we consider

 . this gives n = aa = i 
+ w (cid:18)x,i

(cid:19)(cid:21) , g(n ) = (cid:20) 



x

f (n ) = (cid:20)


x

+ w (cid:18)x,i



(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

(20)

where w is a function to be determined. substitution in eq. (15) yields


w 2(cid:18)x,i



  1(cid:19) 

dw (cid:16)x,i 

  1(cid:17)

dx



w 2(cid:18)x,i



(cid:19) +

dw (cid:16)x,i 
(cid:17)

dx


 = f(cid:18)i




+c(cid:19) .

(21)

the left hand side of this equation depends on x while the right hand side does not. in

order to get a two dimensional realization one needs a solution of eq. (21). in supersymmetric

quantum mechanics, this equation is well known to be the shape invariance condition.

its

solutions are shape invariant superpotentials [8]. one solution is

w = i




tanh x + bsechx .

7

(22)

in this case, an explicit calculation yields f (i 
 ) + 1 . this implies that we
are dealing with a deformed lie algebra with f (j3) = 2j3 + 2c + 1 . for the choice c = 1/2
this is the so(2, 1) algebra and its realization is:

 + c) = 2 (i 

j+ = ei(cid:20)


x  i




tanh x + bsechx(cid:21) , j =(cid:20) 

x  i




tanh x + bsechx(cid:21) ei, j3 = i




+

2

.

there are several other solutions possible [9] and they can be derived analytically using a point

canonical transformation described in ref. [10].

the above realizations have interesting applications. the operator j+j, is given by :

j+j = 


d2

dx2 + w 2(cid:18)x,i



  1(cid:19) 

dw (cid:16)x,i 

  1(cid:17)

.




when acting on factorized basis functions eim(x), one gets

j+j = "

d2
dx2 + w 2 (x, m  1) 

dw (x, m  1)

dx

# ,

which is recognized to be the standard hamiltonian of supersymmetric quatum mechanics. for

the choice of eq. (22) the result is

d2

dx2 + (m  1)2(cid:16)b2  (m  1)2  (m  1)(cid:17) sech2x + b(2(m  1) + 1)sechx tanhx# ,
j+j = "
which is just the hamiltonian for the scarf potential5 with m  1 being one of the parameters.
the scarf potential is well known to be shape invariant, hence exactly solvable [11]. we can

(4) gives j+j = j 2

also determine these eigenvalues using familiar algebraic methods of so(2, 1). the casimir
3  j3  j 2. since the eigenvalues of j 2, j3 are

now substituting j = n  m + 1

(note that e0 = 0 as expected from unbroken supersymmetric quantum mechanics.)

with a change of variable and appropriate similarity transformations of f (n ) and g(n )[10],

we can relate all solvable potentials of ref. [8] to j+j of this algebra and hence derive infor-

mation about their spectrum algebraically.

in this paper, dierential realizations in coordinate space for nonlinearly deformed lie

algebras with three generators were obtained using bosonic creation and annihilation operators.

we have presented a unied formalism that contains as special cases all previously given

coordinate realizations of so(2, 1), so(3) and their deformations. although we have focused on

deformations of the type specied by equation (1), coordinate realizations for other types of

deformations have also been recently studied [12].

at chicago for warm hospitality. partial nancial support from the u.s. department of energy

and the department of science and technology, govt. of india (grant no. sp/s2/k-27/94)

is gratefully acknowledged.

appendix a. dierential realizations of a and a

in this appendix, we discuss dierential coordinate realizations of operators a and a which

satisfy the heisenberg commutation relation h a , ai = 1. the simplest choice is

a =

, a = x .

(24)

d
dx

as we shall see shortly, these operators are the basic building blocks for all other realizations,

including those with higher order derivatives. note that although the notation a and a is

being used, we are not requiring the two operators to be hermitian conjugates of each other.

given any two operators a(x, d

dx ) such that h a , ai = 1, several simple
transformations can be used to generate new operators a and a which satisfy h a , ai = 1.

dx ) and a(x, d

these transformations are:

(i) rotations in the (a, a) plane:

a = a cos  + a sin  , a = a sin  + a cos  ;

(ii) change of variables x = h(y):

a(y,

d
dy

) = a(h(y),

1

h(y)

d
dy

) , a(y,

d
dy

) = a(h(y),

1

h(y)

d
dy

) ,

where prime denotes the derivative with respect to y ;

9

(iii) similarity transformations:

a = 1(x)a(x) , a = 1(x)a(x) ;

(iv) additions of arbitrary functions of the other operator:

a = a + (a) , a = a ; a = a , a = a + (a) .

successive use of the rst three transformations applied to eq. (24) yield

a =

cos 
h(y)

d
dy

+ (h(y) sin  + r(y) cos )

, a =  sin 
h(y)

d
dy

+ (h(y) cos   r(y) sin )

,

(25)

where h(y) and r(y) are arbitrary analytic functions of coordinate y. it is easy to check that

these are the most general operators linear in d

dy which satisfy h a , ai = 1.

a natural question to ask is whether one can construct dierential coordinate realizations

with second and higher order derivatives. this is in fact possible by starting with any rst

order realization [say eq. (24) or eq. (25)] and using transformation (iv) to generate higher

order derivatives. for example, using eq. (24) and taking (a) = a2 in transformation (iv)

gives the realization

a =

d
dx

, a = x +

d2
dx2

.

although this procedure can be readily extended to get realizations of the heisenberg algebra

involving derivatives of any desired order, it must be kept in mind that only the realizations

involving rst order derivatives are fundamental.
