we examine the recent proposal of adding boundary counterterms to the gravitational action for
spacetimes which are locally asymptotic to anti-de sitter. in particular, we explicitly identify higher
order counterterms, which allow us to consider spacetimes of dimensions d  7. as the counterterms
eliminate the need of background subtraction in calculating the action, we apply this technique
to study examples where the appropriate background was unknown or ambiguous: topological black
holes, taub-nut-ads and taub-bolt-ads. for the most part, we nd that the results are consistent
with those found in earlier studies, including the case of vanishing cosmological constant, which is
recovered as a limit. we also identify certain cases where the covariant counterterms fail to render
the action nite, and we comment on the dual eld theory interpretation of this result.

i. introduction

the ads/cft correspondence asserts that there is an equivalence between a gravitational theory in d-dimensional
anti-de sitter (ads) space and a conformal eld theory (cft) living in a (d  1)-dimensional boundary space
[edads]. this equivalence or duality is best understood in the context of string theory with d = 5, where the duality
relates type iib superstring theory on ads5  s5, and n = 4 super-yang-mills theory with gauge group u (n ) in four
dimensions [juan,gubkleb]. a precise formulation of the ads/cft correspondence would be made in equating the
partition functions of the two theories:

zads(0,i) = zcf t (0,i) .

zz

(1)

here the elds 0,i have two interpretations: on the gravity side, these elds correspond to the boundary data or
boundary values (up to a certain rescaling [edads]) for the bulk elds i which propagate in the ads space. on
the eld theory side, these elds correspond to source currents coupled to various cft operators. thus correlation
functions of the operators in the cft can be determined through a calculation using the dynamics of gravity in ads
space [edads,gubkleb]. in certain instances, one can consider evaluating the ads partition function in a saddle-point
approximation:

eiads(i) =der 0,ioiecf t

genie

(2)

where iads(i) is the classical gravitational action as a functional of the (super)gravity elds, and oi are the dual cft
operators. hence in this approximation, the ads action becomes the generating function of the connected correlation
functions in the cft [edads,gubkleb]. this framework is also naturally extended to considering cft states for which
certain operators acquire expectation values by considering solutions of the gravitational equations which are only
asymptotically ads [edadsii,alba].

one aspect of the duality which will be interesting for the present investigation is the choice of the background
metric ij required to dene the eld theory. this metric is related by a(n innite) conformal transformation to
the induced metric hij on the boundary of the ads space [edads]. since the conformal transformation is formally
divergent, one regulates the calculation by considering the induced metric for a family of surfaces which approach the

1

boundary in a limit. this regularization procedure then will depend on the choices of coordinates in the asymptotic
ads region, i.e., it depends on the precise family of surfaces chosen. with dierent choices then, the background
geometry inherited by the cft takes a completely dierent form. for example, depending on the choice of radially
slicing for adsn+1, the boundary geometry can be s1sn, sn+1, s1irn. we will discuss these and other possibilities
in section ii. this procedure then allows one to study the cft with dierent background geometries. from the point
of view of the gravity theory, this process is interesting because naively the expressions on the left-hand side of eqs. (1)
and (2) are coordinate invariant. however, the asymptotic regularization explicitly breaks this covariance.

returning to eq. (2), considering the gravitational path integral in the saddle-point approximation has a long history
in the quantum gravity literature, in particular in context of black hole thermodynamics [eqg]  see refs. [hawkpage]
and [mads] for discussions relevant for ads. there is a minor problem than must faced this approach in that typically
the gravity action diverges. for d = n+1 spacetime dimensions, the familiar (euclidean) action has two contributions

the rst term is just the einsteinhilbertantidesitter action with cosmological constant = n(n1)
. the second
integral is the gibbonshawking boundary term which is required to give, upon variation with metric xed at the
boundary, the einstein equations [eqg]. here, k is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary m as
embedded in m. in the ads context, both of these expressions are divergent because the volumes of both m and
m are innite (and the integrands are nonzero). the traditional approach to circumvent this problem is to perform
a background subtraction. that is one produces a nite result by subtracting from eq. (3) the contribution of
background reference spacetime, so that one can compare the properties of the solution of interest relative to those of
the reference solution. note, however, that this subtraction requires that the asymptotic boundary geometries of the
two solutions can be matched in order to render the surface contribution nite.1 aside from being a technical nuisance,
there are then certain cases where an appropriate reference solution is unknown or ambiguous, e.g., topological black
holes [mann,brillet,vanzo,roberto,birm], and taub-nut-ads and taub-bolt-ads [cejm,hawkhunt]  see discussion
below.

2l2

in the context of the ads/cft correspondence, there does not seem to be room for a background subtraction in,
for example, eq. (2). remarkably ads space oers an alternative approach! the divergences that arise in eq. (3)
are all proportional local integrals of the background cft metric ij [edads,math]. thus these divergences can be
eliminated by extending the regularization procedure for the action with a counterterm subtraction. that is eq. (3)
is modied to include the subtraction of a nite set of boundary integrals (with divergent coecients) involving
curvature scalars constructed from the background metric ij [sken]. the further remarkable insight was recently
provided in ref [pervijay]  see also [coral]  is that if the counterterms are expressed in terms of the induced metric
hij, rather than ij, then they naturally appear with the appropriate divergences as the volume of the regulator
surface grows as it approaches the boundary of ads. thus in the counterterm subtraction approach, one may produce
a nite gravitational action by supplementing the contributions in eq. (3) with an extra surface integral

(4)

where the counterterms depend only on the curvature r (and its derivatives) of the induced boundary metric hij 
see section iii for explicit expressions. that this construction is unique to asymptotically ads spaces is apparent
because the ads curvature scale l is essential in dening the counterterms. note that these expressions are universal
depending only on l and the spacetime dimension. once they are xed, one may use the same counterterms to regulate
the action for any choice of coordinates on any asymptotically ads solution.2

even outside of the ads/cft correspondence, counterterm subtraction provides a remarkable new theoretical tool
with which to investigate gravitational physics. together eqs. (3) and (4) provide a nite covariant denition of the
gravitational action for asymptotically ads spaces. as a simple example, one might consider the energy of a gravitating
system in ads space. traditionally the denition of energy in gravity required a background reference solution
in asymptotically ads spaces [mads,adhh], just as in asymptotically at spaces [adm]. combined the quasilocal
formulation of brown and york [bryk], the ads action with counterterms provides a denition of energy that is

1again, there is the implicit need for a regularization procedure with regards to the asymptotic boundary.
2actually this is not quite the complete story  see below and section vi.

independent of any reference solution [pervijay]. using this technique, one discovers a nite energy for ads5 with
an ir  s3 boundary. in the context of the ads/cft correspondence, one can interprete this energy as the casimir
energy of the dual eld theory in the latter background geometry [pervijay]. a similar casimir energy arises in ads3,
where there is a well-known dierence between the energy m =  1/(8g) of global ads3 and that of the m =0 state
(which is only locally ads3) [pervijay].

further one might revisit euclidean quantum gravity with this new theoretical tool in hand. in particular, one can
consider the cases where the background subtraction technique was not possible or the results were disputed. this is
one of the primary objectives of the current investigation.

the

has
been disputed in for topological black holes [mann,brillet,vanzo,roberto,birm], in particular for the hyperbolic
ads black holes. these are black hole solutions where the horizon is a hyperbolic space h n instead of a sphere. as
it happens, there is among these solutions one which is locally (though not globally) equal to ads. however, in order
for it to be regular, the euclidean time has to take a xed nite value  in other words, it is a nite temperature
solution. as such, it is not an adequate reference state for matching calculations, which would require a solution that
admits arbitrary euclidean period. in section iv, we apply the counterterm subtraction prescription to compute the
action, and discover some intriguing results.

reference

correct

the taubnut solution is known to admit an extension to include a cosmological constant [kramer], and as such,
the taubnutantidesitter (tnads) solution has been studied recently in refs. [cejm,hawkhunt]. the boundary
geometry can not be matched to that of ads space, and so there is no known reference solution with which to make
a background subtraction. in previous works instead, the analog of the selfdual tn solution (i.e., the one with a
nut, a zerodimensional xedpoint set, at its origin) was used as the reference state in a background subtraction
calculation of the action of the taubboltantidesitter (tbads) solution. in section v, we use the counterterm
subtraction for a backgroundless calculation of the action of tn-ads. this allows us to study the thermodynamics
of this solution on itself. in particular, we can study its local intrinsic stability, and nd its entropy, as a function of
the nut charge. this leads to some surprises.

as mentioned above, the counterterm subtraction approach can not be extended in a straightforward way to
asymptotically at (af) spacetimes (and for that matter, to spacetimes which do not asymptote to ads) because the
ads scale is an essential ingredient in the dention of the counterterms (4). however, one can apply this technique
in a casebycase manner to the computation of the action of those asymptotically at solutions which can obtained
as limits of ads solutions. a simple example is the computation of the action of the schwarzschild solution by rst
embedding it in ads. there exists a schwarzschildads solution [hawkpage]  discussed extensively in the context
of the ads/cft correspondence recently [edads,edadsii]  which for black holes that are much smaller than the
cosmological length scale l||1/2 approximates the asymptotically at schwarzschild solution. we can compute
the action of this schwarzschildads black hole by using the counterterm prescription, and then take the limit l.
in this way we recover the standard result that is obtained by matching the af solution to minkowski spacetime3.
we should comment explicitly on this in the text of section iv!

the preceding is a satisfying, but somewhat trivial example. however, there are other cases where the computation
of the action, using the more traditional background subtraction technique, has been the subject of some controversy.
one such case is that of the taubnut solutions, which are only locally asymptotically at (alf). in ref. [malcolm]
the action of generic euclidean taubnut solutions (of which only the selfdual taubnut and taubbolt instantons
are regular) was computed by trying to match the solutions to minkowski space, in order to perform a regularizing
subtraction. however, since the large radius slices of euclidean taubnut space are squashed threespheres, in
contrast to the minkowskian slices s1  s2, the matching is not really well dened. therefore, it was proposed in ref.
[malcolm] are the refs confused here? i.e., theyre both the same.
i thought there was a controversy
with someone calling someone wrong. that the proper background to be subtracted is instead the self-dual
taubnut instanton, which has the lowest possible energy among the regular euclidean taubnut solutionsthe
only other regular solution is the taub-bolt instanton4. it was noticed in ref. [cejm] that there existed a branch of
solutions which tends to the alf taub-nut solution as l. therefore, after applying the counterterm subtraction
procedure to compute the action of the asymptotically tnads solution, we take the limit l. this limit provides
then a background independent result for the action of the alf taub-nut solutions. remarkably, we nd that

3one also recovers a casimir energy that appears for odd d5 and diverges as l  .
4some care should be exercised, since often in the literature the name taubnut solution is used to refer specically to
the selfdual taubnut instanton, instead of the full, twoparameter taubnut solution.

3

the result agrees precisely with the one given in [malcolm]. furthermore, we show that the counterterm prescription
results are reproduced by performing an imperfect matching to ads similar to the one in the alf case.

a simple application of the counterterm subtraction is to calculate the action of (euclidean) adsn+1 for dierent
choices of coordinates, that is with dierent boundary geometries. in section vi, we present an extensive analysis of
the multislicing phenomenon for (euclidean) adsn+1 with n  4, showing the results for the action in each case. it
is interesting to note the appearance of dierent casimir energy in dierent cases. a more dramatic result is that for
certain boundary geometries, such as sn and h n, one nds that the counterterm subtraction is insucient. that is a
divergence that is logarithmic in the asymptotic radius appears, and can not be eliminated by the addition of a local
counterterm as in eq. (4). these divergences which can arise for even n have been noted previously in the context of
the ads/cft correspondence [edads,sken]. there they may be related to a conformal anomaly for the dual cft in
certain background geometries which is well-known to be connected to the appearance of logarithmic divergences in
the eective eld theory action [birdav].

clearly our results have many interesting implications for the dual eld theory via the ads/cft correspondence.
we will only make limited comments on this aspect of the work here, leaving a more general study of the eld theoretic
interpretation for a future paper.

while this work was being completed, we were informed that robb mann [robnut] had also considered the appli-

cation of the ads action with counterterms to the solutions considered in sections iv and v.

ii. the many faces of ads

since all these dierent boundary geometries are related by dieomorphisms, identications, and addition or removal

of points,

the proposal of [pervijay] works by subtracting boundary counterterms from the standard action for an ads space
time. this leaves unspecied the way the boundary of ads is approached, ie, which is the radial coordinate one is
moving along on the way to the boundary. depending on this choice, the slices at constant radius can have dierent
geometry or even dierent topology. even if the spaces may be locally equal to one another, the computation of the
action will in general lead to dierent results, since the boundary terms in the action will take dierent values. in the
end, since all dierent forms of a spacetime will be related by dieomorphisms, with possible addition or subtraction
of points, and possibly as well, identications under discrete subgroups, the dierent results for the action will bear a
relation to one another, too. here we will simply focus on some of these possible faces of the boundary of ads, and
how one obtains a dierent value for the action in each case. clearly, such a comparison would have been impossible
had we required a background for the calculation.

let us rst present euclidean adsn+1 as any of the three following metrics,

by h n1 we mean the (n 1)dimensional hyperbolic space, whose unit metric d2
n1 can be obtained by analytic
continuation of that of sn1. it should be noted that for n = 2 one does not actually have the k = 1 hyperbolic
solution. (we will delay the case of ads3 to the end of the section.) it is straightforward to see that all of the above
solutions are locally equivalent to each other.

transformation r2 = r2  l2 puts the metric back in the k = +1 form.

and so they are all locally ads metrics. if one is simply interested in solving einsteins equations with a negative
cosmological constant

rij =

(11)

then there is allow of the above metrics can be extended by replacing the boundary factors by arbitrary einstein spaces.

in eqs. (all of them), any of the sp (with p > 1) factors can be replaced by a space satisfying erab = (p  1)/l2 gab,
and similarly any h p factors can be replaced by a space satisfying brab = (p  1)/l2 gab. for example, then sp can
be replaced by a product of spheres sp1    spq where sumq
spheres is scaled so r2

i=1pi = p with pi > 2 and the radii of the individual

i = (p  1)/(pi  1) l2.

in these forms, the boundary of ads becomes the euclidean version of a dierent spacetime in each case:

s1  h n1 : the static open universe

for k = 0
for k = 1
for k = 

(12)

there is an important feature that distinguishes the k = 1 solution from k = 0, +1: the vector  has a xedpoint
set (a bolt) at nonvanishing radius r = r+ = l. this is a minimum radius, and it implies that, in order for the
euclidean solution to be regular, the coordinate  has to be identied with period  = 2l. for k = +1,  has no
xed points, and therefore the minimum value for r is r+ = 0. for k = 0,  has a xed point at r = r+ = 0, but this
is an innite proper distance away and does not restrict the periodicity of  . it is clear that for k =  the euclidean
time coordinate has a xed point as well, but this has already been accounted for in the way we have written the
solution.

iii. backgroundless regularization of the action

in [pervijay] it was proposed that the (infrared, innite volume) divergences in the energymomentum tensor of
spacetimes which asymptote to ads asymptotics can be removed by subtracting from the action a nite number of
local counterterms dened as geometric quantities at the boundary of the spacetime. although initially proposed as
a method for computing the stressenergy tensor, the prescription involves the construction of a nite action which
can therefore be employed for the calculation of the action of euclidean instantons, which is the course of action we
take in this paper.

the rst two integrals are the familiar einsteinhilbertantidesitter action and the gibbonshawking boundary
term required to give, upon variation with metric xed at the boundary, the einstein equations with a negative
cosmological constant =  n(n1)
. here, hij is the metric at the boundary m, and k is the trace of its extrinsic
curvature as embedded in m. that is, if n is the outward normal vector to m, then k=hijinj. the counterterm
action ict(hij ) is dened on m, and the number of terms it contains grows with the number of dimensions:

however, in higher dimensions new divergences appear which require operators of higher order for their cancellation.
as far as we know, the precise form of these counterterms remains an open problem.

other terms, for example an action for maxwell elds, can be added to the system. although at least for black
hole solutions the addition of gauge elds does not seem to require new counterterms, we must remain alert to the
possibility that extra matter elds may require the addition of new, nongeometric counterterms to the action. this
issue will not be considered further here.

it is a straightforward matter now to compute the action of these spaces using the backgroundless prescription. for

k = 1, 0 we nd (i guess i should give some more details?)

where k,n1 is the volume of the space d2
k,n1. the limit r   is to be taken, so we only get nite results for
n  4extra counterterms are needed in higher dimensions. besides, the results are not valid for n = 2, since a
spurious contribution appears at an intermediate point in the calculation. as we have explained above, for k = +1, 0,
we have  arbitrary and r+ = 0, whereas for k = 1, r+ = l and  = 2l.

iv. hyperbolic black holes

in the presence of a negative cosmological constant the horizon of a black hole admits a much larger variety of
geometries and topologies than in asymptotically at situations. in [birm] it was shown that the einsteinanti
desitter system in n + 1 dimensions admits the following solutions

a spacetime that is locally the same as anti-desitter space is recovered when  = 0.

by going to the euclidean section one nds that the euclidean time period (the inverse temperature) has to be

(20)

here r+ is the largest positive root of v (r), typically associated to the outer horizon of a black hole. for k = 1 and
 = 0 (global ads) there is no such root, but the correct results are obtained by setting r+ = 0. now, it is important
to notice that, whereas for k = 1, 0 the locally ads solution corresponds to r+ = 0, this is not true for k = 1. ads
space with hyperbolic slicing has a bifurcate killing horizon at r = l, and a xed temperature  = 2l. in contrast,
there exists an extremal k = 1 solution, with a degenerate horizon at r = re and parameter  = e, satsifying

therefore, in a calculation for k = 1 of the action with background matching the question arises of which is the
correct background to subtract: on the one hand, the locally ads solution, which has the highest symmetry, might
be physically appealing. but, since its period  is xed, matching it to a solution with a dierent value of  would
introduce a conical singularity at the horizon [vanzo]. on the other hand, the extremal solution, with a lower value
of  (and as we will see, of the energy), has arbitrary  and therefore can be matched to any other solution. hence,
the extremal solution was the preferred background for the matching calculations in chosen in [vanzo,roberto,birm].
it is clear from this discussion that the method of backgroundless subtraction can be of help here. for the solutions

described above we get

(24)

where k,n1 is the volume of the space d2
k,n1. as usual, the limit r   is to be taken, and the results are only
valid for n = 3, 4. using (24) we can compute the energy and entropy of the solutions by application of standard
thermodynamical formulas. ill write the results for these.

curiously, the results for n = 3 and n = 4 show dierent qualitative features. for n = 3 the result we obtain is the
same as one would obtain by performing a background subtraction from the locally ads4 solution neglecting the conical
singularity that would appear for k = 1. this is rather similar to what we nd for tn-ads: the backgroundless
subtraction appears to reproduce the results of an imperfect matching calculation. as a result, the extremal solution
(22) has negative energy, whereas the locally ads solution, with  = 0, has vanishing action and energy.

in contrast, the result for the hyperbolic n = 4 black holes seems to support the opposite view! the action (24)
in this case reproduces precisely that obtained by taking the extremal state (23) as the reference state, and not the
locally ads state (notice that i = 0 for the values (23)). let us inspect in some more detail the energy as computed
from (24) for n = 4

(26)

notice that for k = 1 the energy vanishes for the extremal state, a conrmation that this is to be taken as the
ground state of the theory. the term e0
k is independent of the black hole parameters (say, of the temperature), and
its contribution to the action is therefore of the form e0
k. for k = 1 this term has been identied in [pervijay] as
precisely the casimir energy associated to n = 4 superyangmills theory on the static einstein spacetime ir s3
which is the spacetime obtained as the boundary of ads in this case. this agreement is a striking outcome of the
backgroundless subtraction method. notice that the interpretation as a casimir energy is the only possible one, given
that the ads solution is the one with the lowest action and energy among that familyie, it is the ground state.

we would like to see whether a similar correspondence holds for k = 1. in this case it is crucial to notice that the
ground state is not the locally ads solution. the latter should be regarded as an excited state of the system. the
ground state is the extremal solution, which has zero energy. by translating this into the ads/cft correspondence
we would not expect to nd a casimir energy for the eld theory calculations on the open static universe ir  h 3.
indeed, the eective action and renormalized stressenergy tensor for conformal elds vanish on that space (see, eg,
[birdav]). this is in perfect agreement with the results that we nd for the ground state (23) of the theory.

there are, however, some aspects that are in need of further exploration. in particular, if we compute the entropy

from (24) we nd that it satises the area law

s =

k,n1rn1

+

4g

(27)

(the formula can only be properly checked for n = 3, 4, but a calculation with background subtraction yields this
same value for arbitrary n). therefore, for k = 1, not only the locallyads solution has nonzero entropy, but so
does the extremal ground state too. in particular, for n = 4,

sext =

k=1,3l3

27/2g

(28)

in this respect, this ground state bears resemblance to the extremal state exhibited in [cejm2], which had non
vanishing entropy as well. it would be really interesting to understand the result (28) from a eldtheoretical point
of view.

v. the antidesitter nutcracker

the taubnutantidesitter (tnads) solution is

ds2 = v (r)(d + 2n cos d)2 +

dr2
v (r)

+ (r2  n2)(d2 + sin2 d2)

where

v =

(r2 + n2)  2mr + l2(r4  6n2r2  3n4)

r2  n2

(29)

(30)

here we will simply sketch some of the features of the solution. for a detailed analysis we refer the reader to ref. [cejm].
if n=0 we recover the schwarzschildads solutions with m as a mass parameter. the analytically continued time,  ,
parameterizes a circle, s1, which is bred over the two sphere s2, with coordinates  and . the nontrivial bration
is a result of a nonvanishing nut charge n. as a result, the boundary as r   is described as a squashed
threesphere, where 4n2/l2 parameterizes the squashing.

8

euclidean regularity of the solution restricts the period of  to be

=8n.

(31)

in addition, the mass parameter has to be restricted so that the xed point set of  at radial position r = r+
is a regular one. hence one nds nut or bolt solutions, depending on whether the xed point set is zero- or
two-dimensional, respectively. in particular, for nut solutions

r+ = n,

mn = n 

4n3
l2 .

(32)

in what follows, by tn-ads we will mean the taubnutads solutions with this particular value of m. notice
that mn vanishes for the value n = l/2. it was shown in [cejm] that for this particular value the solution is precisely
ads4, with the slicing in which the sections at constant r are round threespheres. in contrast, the solution with
n = m = 0 corresponds to ads4 with slices of geometry s1  s2. for taubboltads (tbads) the expressions are
more complicated [cejm]:

mb =

b + n2
r2

r+ = rb =

12n 1 r1  48

n2
l2 + 144

(33)

(34)

for rb to be real the discriminant must be nonnegative. futhermore we must take the part of the solution which
corresponds to rb>n. this gives:

n   1

6 

2

12! 1
3

l.

(35)

it is only for this range of parameters that one can construct real euclidean tbads solutions. notice, in particular,
that the ads value l=2n lies outside this range.

in refs. [cejm,hawkhunt], the action of the tbads solutions was computed by matching the solutions to a tn
ads solution with the same value of the nut charge. the thermodynamics of tbads solutions were then found
to be rather similar to that of schwarzschildads black holes. however, this method precluded an analysis of the
tnads solutions by themshelves, since they acted as reference states. a completely rigourous calculation of the
action of tnads could not be performed using the reference background method, simply because it is not possible
to match pure ads (the intuitively obvious candidate background) to tnads, as they have incompatible slices for
all n except n=l/2. equipped with the backgroundless subtraction procedure we can now compute the action for
tnads, without any reference to a background.
with

h =pv (r)(r2  n2) sin ,

r =

r2  n2 

2n2

(r2  n2)2 v (r)

we nd, for a solution with generic values of m and n

where, as we said above, r+ is the minimum possible value of r, where there is a xed point of  .

i =

4n

+(cid:1)
gl2 (cid:0)l2m + 3n2r+  r3

(36)

(37)

there are several things to note about this result. the rst is a consistency check: if we subtract the values we
obtain for the tbads and tnads solutions, ibolt  inut, we recover (after some algebra), the result obtained in
[cejm,hawkhunt] for the action of tbads with tnads as a reference.

next, in the at space limit l we obtain

in particular, in this limit we nd

(39)

these are precisely the results that were obtained in [malcolm] by an imperfect match of the taubnut solution
to euclidean minkowski space. indeed, the same imperfect match to ads can be seen to reproduce the result (37)
above. even if it is not possible to match the squashed s3 at the boundary to the boundary of ads4 with the slicing
s1  s2, a nite result can nevertheless be obtained by neglecting the nontrivial bering and performing a standard
background subtraction. proceeding this way the bulk (volume) term yields, at large r

ibulk =

4n

+(cid:1) +
gl2 (cid:0)l2m + 3n2r+  r3

n3r
gl2 + o(1/r).

(40)

in contrast to other action calculations in ads, the bulk term, even after subtraction, is not nite by itself, rather
one needs to take into account the gibbonshawking boundary term:

igh = 

1

8gzm

d3xh(k  k0) = 

n3r
gl2 + o(1/r).

(41)

by adding (40) and (41) and taking r   we therefore recover eqn. (37).

we therefore conclude that the fact that the match to the background is an imperfect one does not appear to be as
bad as it looks at rst sight. certainly, the result (38) of ref. [malcolm] in the alf limit is on a better standing after
having recovered it from a backgroundless calculation.

now we return to the result (37), and specialize to nut solutions (32):

itnads =

4n2

g (cid:18)1 

2n2

l2 (cid:19) .

(42)

for n=l/2 we recover the value for ads4 with boundary s3 that was obtained in the previous section, whereas for
n=0 we recover the value (zero) for ads4 with boundary s1s2. again, these special cases may be regarded as
consistency checks on the internal consistency of our implementation of the procedure.
notice that the action becomes negative for n>n0=l/2. more interestingly, being able to vary the value of the

euclidean period =8n we can compute the energy of the solutions,

e = i =

mn
g

(43)

which conrms the interpretation of m as a mass parameter. we may go further and compute the entropy and specic
heat:

s = i  i =

c = s =

6n2

4n2

g (cid:18)1 
l2 (cid:19)
g (cid:18)1 + 12
l2(cid:19) .

8n2

n2

(44)

(45)

as had been already noticed in [], the mass (energy) becomes negative for n>l/2. more strikingly, the entropy becomes
negative for n>l/6! in particular, the entropy of ads4 (n=l/2) is negative (equal to minus its action, since it has
e=0). whereas a negative mass may not be too troublesome (one may change the energy scale), a negative entropy
certainly would appear to be a sign of pathological behavior.

in [gibbhawk] it was pointed out that in spaces where euclidean time is non-trivially bered there appeared a
contribution to the entropy other than the usual one coming from the bolts (the latter yield the black hole area law).
this extra entropy can be associated to misner strings (a geometric analog of dirac strings), and we would expect
it to contribute to the entropy of tnads. indeed, in the absence of a bolt this appears to be the only possible source
of gravitational entropy for the tnads solution. however, the area of the misner strings in tnads is innite, so
it seems dicult to relate it to the expression we obtained in eq. (44).

10

the fact that the specic heat becomes negative for n<l/12 is an indication that the solutions become thermally
unstable, perhaps making them unusable for equilibrium thermodynamics7. so if we declare that the physically
relevant solutions are those with both positive entropy and positive specic heat, then the valid range for the nut
charge is

l
12  n 

l
6

.

(46)

solutions in this range have positive action and positive energy.

finally, we note that the results for the energy, entropy and specic heat of tbads can be recovered by combining

those for tnads above, and those for tbads with the tnads subtraction in ref. [cejm].

b. flat and hyperbolic taubnutads

a solution where the nuts and bolts are at planes instead of spheres can be found as well, and was analyzed in

[cejm],

where, now,

ds2 = v (r)(cid:16)d +

n

l2 (xdy  ydx)(cid:17)2

+

dr2
v (r)

+

r2  n2

l2

(dx2 + dy2)

v = 2mr + l2(r4  6n2r2  3n4)

r2  n2

.

(47)

(48)

the bration is in this case a trivial one, and as a result the euclidean period  is independent of n. zerodimensional
xedpoint sets of  (nuts) exist for mn =  4n3
l2 . solutions with bolts have a higher value of m. the result for
the backgroundless calculation of the action for a solution with generic m and n is

i =

(49)

l2

8gl2(cid:0)ml2  r3

+ + 3n2r+(cid:1)

where, as usual, r+ is the radial position of the xedpoint set (r+ = n for a nut), and l2 accounts for the area of the
(x, y) plane, l/2x, yl/2. it can be easily checked that the action of [cejm], where the nut solution was taken as
a reference background, can be recovered from (49) as i(bolt)  i(nut). moreover, (49) is the same result we would
obtain had we performed a background subtraction calculation with imperfect matching to ads4 (the latter in its
at incarnation as n = m = 0 in (47)). we note that for the nut values the action is negative, which reects the
fact that its energy is negativeits entropy vanishes, as could have been expected in the absence of bolts or misner
strings, so in fact we nd inut = enut.

the last possibility is that of having hyperbolic xedpoint sets of  . the explicit solution is

ds2 = v (r)(d + 2n(cosh   1)d)2 +

dr2
v (r)

+ (r2  n2)(d2 + sinh2 d2)

with

v = (r2 + n2)  2mr + l2(r4  6n2r2  3n4)

r2  n2

.

(50)

(51)

the bration is trivial, and, again, there are no misner strings. however, it was found in [cejm] that there are no
hyperbolic nuts.: it is not possible to make r=n into a regular xed point of  . nevertheless, bolt solutions can be

7nevertheless, a negative specic heat is not so bad as a negative entropy; as a matter of fact, as is well known, the schwarzschild
black hole in asymptotically at space has negative specic heatand so does the alf taub-nut solution as well.

constructed. this is rather analogous to the situation we encounter for hyperbolic black holes in sec.iv. the result
for the action is again formally very similar to (37) and (49),

i =



+(cid:1)
8gl2(cid:0)l2m + 3n2r+  r3

where  is the area of the hyperbolic space (if quotients of h 2 are taken to yield surfaces of genus g > 1 then
 = 4(g  1)).

vi. ads revisited

for k =  the results are somewhat more complicated to express for generic n in an explicit form. for the three

contributions (the bulk term, the gibbonshawking boundary term, and the counterterm action) we nd

n is the volume of the unit sn (ie, n = k=1,n in our notation above), and again the limit r   remains to be

(57)

observe that for the latter case, n = 4, there remains a logarithmic divergence from the bulk terms that is not cancelled
by the boundary counterterms. even if at rst sight this might appear to imply trouble with the backgroundless
subtraction procedure, it is in fact needed for consistency with the ads/cft interpretation of the results!

let us write this result in terms of eld theory parameters, by using the relation l3 = 2n 2g,

i,5 =

n 2

4 (cid:18)1 + 4 log

4r

l (cid:19)

(58)

a lot of blah blah blah follows. a bit of the discussion on casimir energies etc has been included in

the section on hyperbolic bhs

(it must be interesting to compare the calculation of the casimir energy for the
case of ads3 with k = the cft part should be a simple calculation in 1 + 1 cft, using
the central charge c = 3l

2g . the ads calculation shouldnt be difficult either).

for ads3 we only have the cases k = +1, 0,, for which

i+1,3 =

i0,3 = 0

(59)

and

i,3 = 

l

4g(cid:18)1 + 2 log

4r

l (cid:19) .

(60)

as we have mentioned, the dierence between these two values can be easily interpreted as the relative casimir energy
of a twodimensional cft on the cylinder and on the plane.

using the brownhenneaux relation [brhe] for the central charge of the virasoro algebra of asymptotic symmetry

generators, c = 3l

2g we can write this as

i,3 = 

c

6(cid:18)1 + 2 log
