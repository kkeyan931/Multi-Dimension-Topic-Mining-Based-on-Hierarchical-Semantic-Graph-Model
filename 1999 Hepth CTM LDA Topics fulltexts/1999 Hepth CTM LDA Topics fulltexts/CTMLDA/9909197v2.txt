abstract

the recently proposed technique to regularize the divergences of the gravitational
action on non-compact space by adding boundary counterterms is studied. we pro-
pose prescription for constructing the boundary counterterms which are polynomial
in the boundary curvature. this prescription is ecient for both asymptotically
anti-de sitter and asymptotically at spaces. being mostly interested in the asymp-
totically at case we demonstrate how our procedure works for known examples of
non-compact spaces: eguchi-hanson metric, kerr-newman metric, taub-nut and
taub-bolt metrics and others. analyzing the regularization procedure when bound-
ary is not round sphere we observe that our counterterm helps to cancel large r
divergence of the action in the zero and rst orders in small deviations of the ge-
ometry of the boundary from that of the round sphere.
in order to cancel the
divergence in the second order in deviations a new quadratic in boundary curva-
ture counterterm is introduced. we argue that cancelation of the divergence for
nite deviations possibly requires innite series of (higher order in the boundary
curvature) boundary counterterms.

1 introduction

the classical dynamics of the gravitational eld (metric g on d-dimensional manifold

m d) is determined by the einstein-hilbert (eh) action

weh[g] = 

1

16g (cid:18)zm d

(r + 2) + 2zm d

k(cid:19) ,

(1.1)

where the boundary term proportional to the extrinsic curvature k of the boundary

m should be added in order to make the variational procedure of the action (when

only metric but not its normal derivative is xed on the boundary) well dened [1], [2].

when manifold m is non-compact one considers a sequence of compact manifolds mr
with boundary mr parameterized by radius r such that mr  m for large r. the
functional (1.1) on non-compact manifold m then should be understood as result of the

limit weh[mr  m]. it is, however, a well known problem that this limiting procedure
is not well dened since weh[mr] diverges in the limit of large r. therefore, the limiting

procedure should be accompanied with some regularization. the traditional way [3] of

handling this problem is to subtract a contribution of some reference metric g0 that

matches suitably the asymptotic and topological properties of the metric g. the choice of

the metric g0 is interpreted as xing the vacuum state. however, such a reference metric

does not always exist which makes this subtraction procedure quite uncertain.

it was realized recently that when the space m is asymptotically ads (rather than

asymptotically at) one can take an alternative route. in the context of ads/cft cor-

respondence the general analysis (based on the previous mathematical works [4], [5]) of

the divergences of the eh action for ads space was done in [6]. inspired by ads/cft

correspondence, balasubramanian and kraus [7] have proposed to add to the action (1.1)

a counterterm which is functional of the curvature invariants of the induced metric hij on

mr. the role of this term (which does not aect the gravitational equations in the bulk)

is to cancel appropriately the large r divergence appearing in weh[mr]. the counterterm

wct[hij] can be arranged as an expansion in powers of the curvature of the boundary

where rij and r are respectively ricci tensor and ricci scalar of the boundary metric, l
is the ads radius related to the cosmological constant as  = (d1)(d2)
. the terms (1.2)

(d  5)(d  3)2 (r2

(1.2)

2l2

are sucient to cancel divergences for d  7. on the other hand, the leading divergence
in any d is always killed by the term (rst introduced in [9]) in (1.2) which is proportional

to the area of the boundary.

it should be mentioned that introducing counterterms

which are polynomial in the boundary curvature one is able to cancel all divergences

of the action (1.1) but not the logarithmic one (appearing when (d  1) is even). the
later divergence can be canceled by adding a counterterm which is not polynomial in

curvature. for example, for d = 3 it is the term r lnr that should be added. in higher
dimensions there is ambiguity in choosing such terms. up to this subtlety the procedure

of introducing the counterterms (1.2) is universal and well-dened.

encouraged by this example one could try to construct appropriate boundary term

which cancels the leading divergence for asymptotically at space. this term can be found

but it is not analytic function of the boundary curvature [11], [12]

(1.3)

the constant clm depends on the topological type of the boundary at large r. for the
schwarzschild like metric (when boundary is topologically s1  sd2) one has clm =
2q d2
d3 . not requiring the counterterm to be analytic function of the curvature one can

also construct a term interpolating between expressions (1.2) and (1.3) [12], [13]

(1.4)

indeed, for large r the boundary curvature r vanishes and we need to take the limit of
small r in (1.4) in order to get (1.2). on the other hand, the asymptotically at case is
obtained by taking the limit of large l in (1.4). the expression (1.3) then is reproduced.

the extrinsic curvature of the asymptotic boundary of ads space is constant, k = (d1)

. therefore,

l

the rst term in (1.2) can be presented as surface integral of k. for d = 3 this was observed in [10]

3

we stress that this interpolation exists only for the choice of the constant clm in (1.3) as

in the case of the schwarzschild black hole. the boundary then is s1  sd2. for other
types of the boundary the expression (1.4) does not match (1.3) in the limit of large l.

there are, however, reasons to think that it is not eligible to drop the analyticity

in the proposed procedure of introducing the boundary counterterms. the form of the

counterterms then is not unique and, in fact, quite ambiguous. indeed, for asymptotically

at space, not only r but any function (r2

ij)1/4, (r2

ijkl)1/4 or even higher roots of

higher power curvature invariants can be chosen as a candidate for the counterterm. in
the asymptotically ads case we also can take as a counterterm any function f (l2r) that
approaches (1 +
2(d3)(d2)r) for small r. among these functions, in particular, there

l2

are ones which do not have the well-dened at space (l  ) limit.

another reason why it is not desirable to use non-analytic boundary counterterms

appears from the consideration of the eh term in quantum theory. any quantum eld

makes contribution to the eh action.

in fact, this contribution is uv divergent and

we have to renormalize the newtons constant g (and cosmological term ) in order to

handle these divergences. the natural question then if the structure of the classical action

weh + wct is preserved under quantum corrections and whether it remains the same after

the renormalization. for the eh action (1.1) along, this question was addressed in [14].

it was found that the exact balance between the bulk and boundary parts in the quantum

action is the same as in the classical action (1.1). hence the renormalization of only

newtons constant (the  term was dropped in [14] but this does not aect the main

conclusion) is sucient to regularize both the bulk and boundary uv divergences.

in

fact this statement is quite obvious in the case of matter minimally coupled to gravity.

one just has to impose dirichlet or neumann conditions on the quantum eld on the

boundary m. in the non-minimal case the boundary condition should be chosen of the

mixed type in order to make this statement valid. analyzing now this problem for the

action weh + wct with the counterterm in the form (1.3) or (1.4) it is hard to imagine

how this structure can be preserved in the quantum case since only terms analytic in the

boundary curvature are known to appear in the quantum eective action (at least in its

uv divergent part) on manifold with boundary.

4

concluding our brief analysis we see that the non-analytic boundary counterterms are

likely not allowed in unambiguous and universal procedure of the regularization of the

gravitational action. the purpose of this paper is to propose another way of constructing

the counterterms remaining in the class of the functions which are analytic in curvature.

in asymptotically at case, we are not going to generalize the ads prescription (1.2) in

the part of the dependence of the boundary counterterm on the boundary metric. instead,

keeping the general structure of the counterterm as in (1.2), we dene a scale parameter

l (analogous to the parameter l in ads case) which characterizes the global geometry

of the space (in fact, it is the coordinate invariant diameter of the space) and can be

used in the constructing the counterterms in the same fashion as in the ads case. the

prescription, thus, works universally both in asymptotically ads and asymptotically at

cases and deals only with analytic structure of the counterterms.

2 the proposal

it should be noted that the counterterm (1.2) is not an o-shell quantity.

in fact, it

contains some information about the asymptotic bulk geometry. namely, the space-time

is supposed to be anti-de sitter space with radius l. the role of the parameter l in ads

). second, it measures the size of the space: l is that quantity which relates

l2

space is two-fold. first, it measures the curvature of the bulk geometry (ricci scalar
r =  d(d1)
volume of ads space v (mr) and area of its boundary a(mr) in the limit of large r, i.e.
l  v (mr)
the gravitational theory in the bulk of ads space and the conformal eld theory on the

a(mr). this relation is the key one [15] in the holographic correspondence between

boundary. as we said above, our idea is to introduce parameter l which for asymptotically

at space plays the role similar to that of the parameter l in the ads case. since it is not

possible in general to nd any scale parameter universally related to the curvature if the

space is asymptotically at it is the holographic relation which we are going to generalize.

note, that in our prescription we do not require metric to satisfy any equations of motion

and in this sense it is o-shell prescription. we only demand that (in the case of zero

cosmological constant) the curvature of the space-time dies suciently fast with large r

5

so that the bulk integral rmr r converges in the large r limit. the only divergence of the
gravitational action (1.1) then comes from the boundary term 2rmr k. note also that

we will be mostly considering the leading divergence of the action.

consider compact manifold mr with boundary mr parameterized by radial coordi-

nate r in an appropriate coordinate system. let v (mr) be invariant volume of mr and

a(mr) be area of the boundary mr. dene the diameter l of the manifold mr as

follows

l =

v (mr)
a(mr)

.

(2.1)

consider now the sequence of compact manifolds mr approaching the noncompact man-

ifold m in the limit of large r. the diameter l then, in general, becomes function of r.

defying the gravitational action wgr[m] as the limit of the actions wgr[mr] for large r
we want it to be nite as r  . the action we propose takes the form

wgr[mr] = weh[mr] + wct[mr]

,

where, as in the ads case (1.2), the boundary counterterm
h

c()

1

wct[mr] = 

16g

lr zmr

(2.2)

(2.3)

is proportional to the area of the boundary.

first, we want to demonstrate that by adding the counterterm (2.3) we do not change

the einstein equations following from the eh action. we x nite r and consider small

variations of the metric in the bulk assuming the induced metric on the boundary mr is

xed. the diameter (2.1) changes under variation of the metric in the bulk. at rst sight it

seems that this may result in rather complicated equations when the action (2.2) is varied.

however, it is quite surprising that the presence of the extra term (2.3) makes the same
aect in the eld equations as that of the eective cosmological constant ef f =  c()
2(l)2 :

wgr = 

1

16g zmr

g (cid:18)r 

1
2

gr  ef f g(cid:19) .

(2.4)

so if we were considering the region of nite r the extra boundary term (2.3) would show

up in the gravitational equations in the form of the nite cosmological constant ef f (in

fact, this would be an interesting mechanism of generating the cosmological constant).

6

however, being interested in the innite space we should take the limit of innite r (or
innite l since l  r for asymptotically at space). the quantity ef f disappears in this
limit and the gravitational equations remain unaected.

in order to show that the gravitational action (2.2), (2.3) is indeed less divergent

than (1.1) and determine the coecient c() let us consider on m d the coordinate system
(, xi, i = 1, ..., d  1) where metric looks as

ds2 = d2 + hij(, x)dxidxj

.

(2.5)

the compact manifold mr is determined by range of the radial coordinate 0    r.
the boundary mr stays at  = r and hij(r, x) is the metric induced on the boundary.

the area of the boundary mr and the volume of mr are given by

a(mr)  a(r) = z qh(x, r)dd1x ,
v (mr)  v (r) = z r

a()d .

assume that for large r the area function a(r) is represented by the series

a(r) = a0r + a1r1 + br1 ln r + ...

,

(2.6)

(2.7)

where a0, a1, b are some coecients and ... stands for the subleading terms. then for

the volume of mr we have that

v (r) =

a0

 + 1

r+1 +  a1
 

b

2! r +

ln r + ...

(2.8)

the parameter  > 0 is the coordinate invariant, it shows how the area of mr (or volume

of mr) grows for large r. the radius l dened by the relation (2.1) then reads

l =

(2.9)

for the extrinsic curvature of the boundary we have rmr k = ra(r). so that the leading

divergence of the eh action for large r is proportional to r1. assuming that the bulk

part of (2.2) converges for large r (this restricts the metric hij(r, x) to grow asymptotically

not faster than r2) we nd that the boundary part of (2.2) is given by

taking now the limit of innite r we nd that the leading divergence of the gravitational

action cancels provided we choose the constant c() to be

c() =

so that the regularized action

wgr =

8g

r2 1


b + o(r3)

(2.11)

(2.12)

is nite if   2. in some cases the logarithmic term in the expansion (2.7) is absent.
then the leading term in the action (2.12) is of the order r3. thus, the adding the

counterterm (2.3) guarantees the cancelation of the leading divergence. in order to kill

the still present in the action divergences one has to introduce extra counterterms like the

terms l rm r or (l)3rm r2. we consider such terms in sections 3 and 4.

in order to determine l we have to have information about the whole manifold m.

however, for the cancelation of the divergences in the gravitational action only asymptotic

behavior of l is important. therefore, it would be desirable to dene another quantity

la as asymptotic value of l for large r. it can be used (instead of l) in constructing the
boundary counterterm (2.3). the advantage of using la is that the counterterm (2.3) then

depends only on asymptotic properties of the bulk metric and is not sensitive to what

happens inside the manifold. the quantity la is not, however, uniquely dened since it

depends on how many terms (as in (2.9)) we want to keep in the large r expansion of

l. on the other hand, the freedom in choosing the coordinates in the asymptotic metric

(2.5) also may result in ambiguity in the denition of la. in all cases these ambiguities
aect only the subleading terms in la and, eventually, in the gravitational action. note

in this context that picking up the rst three terms in the expansion (2.9) and using this

in the counterterm (2.3) we get exactly the same result (2.12) for the the leading part of

gravitational action as when l is used. of course, we can add more subleading terms not

changing this conclusion.

we still need to nd an unambiguous and coordinate invariant notion of the asymptotic

value of l. in order to get an idea of such notion consider the large r (i.e. valid outside of

some compact large enough region of manifold m) expansion of the diameter l done in

8

any appropriate coordinate system. the r dependent terms in this expansion, for instance,
functions {r, ln r, 1, 1/r, 1/r2, ...}, can be considered as forming basis in functional space
and the large r expansion of l is just a decomposition of l along this basis. among the

elements consisting the basis there are ones which grow innitely with r. in the above

example only the functions r and ln r are such elements. then, the projection of l onto

subspace spanned by the asymptotically growing elements is what we will call the leading

asymptotic value la. for the expansion (2.9) we have

la =

r

ln r .

note, that by denition the constant term is not included in la. the quantity la appears

to be unambiguous and coordinate invariant.

the gravitational action regularized by the counterterm (2.3) with la then reads

(a1  b)r2 + o(r3) .

(2.13)

for  = 2 it takes the nite value which is dierent from (2.12). in many examples of 4-

dimensional metrics we consider below the parameters b and a1 are related as b = 2a1.

then the limit of large r in the expressions (2.12) and (2.13) for  = 2 gives rise to
results opposite in sign, wgr = w a
procedure gives the same result as the standard subtraction method. in all examples we

(2.16)

(2.17)

in w a

gr we recognize the standard expression for the action of the schwarzschild metric

[2], [18], [12].

the parameter  in (2.7)-(2.9) is an important characteristics of the asymptotic ge-

ometry of the manifold m d. demanding the bulk metric to approach asymptotically

the (locally) at metric,  is restricted by topology of the asymptotic boundary m.

in the simplest case, when size of m d grows equally in all directions (for example, if
m d is (d  1)-sphere and asymptotic metric on m d is ds2 = dr2 + r2ds2
sd1), we have
 = d  1. however,  can be less than (d  1) if, for example, asymptotic metric is
ds2 = pn
sdn1, where each coordinate zi is compact. then  = dn1.
it seems to follow from these examples that  is related to the dimension of the spheric

i +dr2+r2ds2

i=1 dz2

component in the boundary m.

in d = 4 the locally at metric may take the form

ds2 = dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2) + (d + 2n cos d)2. the surface of constant r is then

the hopf ber bundle s3  s2 with ber s1. locally it looks as direct product s1  s2.
however, the appropriate identications (in  and ) and overlapping coordinate patches

give the surface of constant r the topology of s3. in this case  = 2 is the same as for the
boundary s1  s2.

in the asymptotically ads case, the expansion (2.7) is not valid since the area

a(r) = e(d1)r/lld1a0(1 + o(er/l))

grows exponentially with r. as a result, the quantity l asymptotically takes the constant

value

l =

l

d  1

+ o(er/l) .

10

(2.18)

therefore, the notion of the leading asymptotic value la dened above is not good for the

asymptotically ads spaces. in this case, we have to dene it as the rst, constant, term in

the large r expansion. so that we have la = l

d1 . using this quantity in the counterterm
(2.3) we reproduce correctly the rst term in the ads expression (1.2) provided value

 = d 2 is used to dene the constant c() (2.11). it is interesting to note that using the
quantity l in (1.2) we are able to cancel all divergences of the action including the loga-

rithmic one. in the ads case the size of the asymptotic boundary always grows in equal

proportion in all directions when boundary approaches innity. so that  should depend

only on dimension d and be the same for all possible metrics on the boundary. note, that

it is kind of mystery that  in the ads case should be the same as in the asymptotically

at case with one s1 component in the boundary (i.e. as in the schwarzschild black hole

case). this becomes even more surprising when we recall that for the ads space both

the bulk and boundary parts in the eh action diverge while for the asymptotically at

space only the boundary part causes the divergence. the same is also true for the lau-

mann prescription with the counterterm (1.3) where the coecient clm (for boundary
being product of a sphere and s1 factors) should in general be clm = 2q 
1 . only for
 = d  2 (the boundary is s1  sd2) there exists a correspondence between (1.3) and
the ads prescription (1.4). there must be deep reasons for the coincidence of -s in these

two cases.

3 examples

3.1 asymptotically (globally/locally) euclidean spaces

the asymptotically (globally) euclidean space is dened [16] to be one admitting a

chart {x} such that for (xx)1/2 =  > 0 the metric can be written as

g =  1 +

a2

2!2

 + o(

(3.1)

it is known that the only asymptotically globally euclidean solution of the einstein equa-

tions is at space. usually the at space-time is considered as a reference metric with

respect to which one determines the contribution of a curved metric to the action. in

this way, one automatically (by denition) assigns zero gravitational action to the at

11

space. it is then a part of the positive action theorem that in the class of asymptotically

euclidean metrics the gravitational action is zero only if metric is at. in our method,

however, at space stands on the equal ground with any other space-times and it is not

meaningless to ask what is the gravitational action for the at space-time itself. choose

in our analysis we are not restricted to consider only solutions of the einstein equations

and are interested in any metric for which the bulk integralrmr r converges for large r. an

example of asymptotically euclidean metric with vanishing ricci scalar r is the wormhole

metric [16]

a2

42 )2(cid:16)d2 + 2ds2

s3(cid:17) ,

(3.2)

where ds2

s3 is metric of standard 3-sphere. obviously, the condition (3.1) is satised for

(3.2). in fact, the metric (3.2) describes space with two asymptotically euclidean regions

at    and   0 with minimal 3-sphere located at  = a/2. one can bring metric
(3.2) to the form (2.5) by introducing radial coordinate  =   a2

4 . then (3.2) reads

ds2 = d2 + (2 + a2)ds2
s3

.

(3.3)

since the manifold has two asymptotic regions (at large negative and positive values

of ) we dene the compact manifold mr in a symmetric way as r    r. the
boundary mr then has two components at  = r and  = +r respectively. the
manifold m then is approached in the symmetric limit when r  . the area a(r)
of the boundary mr is a(r) = 2(r2 + a2)3/23. the integral of the extrinsic curvature

being extended to higher dimension d the metric (3.3) has scalar curvature r = (d1)(d4)a2

reads rmr k = ra(r) = 6r(r2 + a2)1/23 and the eh action weh =  3

maximal possible value  = d  1. an example of d = 4 asymptotically locally euclidean

identied. the surface  = a is a 2-sphere. defying mr as 0    r we nd

that the counterterm (2.3) precisely compensates the r2-divergence while the rest terms

vanish (as a4

r2 ) in the limit of large r. thus, the metric (3.6) has vanishing gravitational
action, wgr = 0. one obtains the same result if the asymptotic quantity la is used in the

counterterm.

3.2 asymptotically at spaces

in the class of asymptotically at metrics we include all metrics describing space-time

with boundary at innity being an s1 bundle over an sd2, where s1 ber approaches a
constant length. so the growth of the area of the boundary for large r is due to the spheric

component sd2 and we have  = d 2 for all spaces of this class. for d = 4 such bundles
are labeled by the rst chern number. if it vanishes the boundary has topology of the

direct product s1  sd2. otherwise, its topology is more complicated. the boundary
then is a squashed sphere. the ber s1 in the bundle is usually due to the compactied

euclidean time.

a. schwarzschild metric in d dimensions

a generalization of the 4-dimensional metric (2.14) to higher dimensions is the metric

ds2 = g()d 2 +

d2

+ 2ds2

sd2 , g() = 1  (




)d3 ,

(3.8)

where 0    2h, h = 2
d3 . though the analysis can be done in terms of the
metric of the type (2.5) the calculation is simpler for the metric in the form (3.8). in this

coordinate system we dene the compact manifold mr as     r. the area of mr
and volume of mr are

a(r) = 2hd2rd2g1/2(r) ,
v (r) = 2hd2

(rd1  d1) .

(3.9)

for large r the area a(r) grows as rd2 so that  = d  2. the diameter l of mr is

l(r) =

r

d  1

g1/2(r)(cid:18)1  (


r

)d1(cid:19) .

(3.10)

in the coordinate system (3.8) the integral of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary is

given by the formula rmr k = nrra(r), where nr = g1/2(r) is the non-zero component

of vector normal to mr. for nite r the regularized action (2.2) reads

wgr =

(3.11)

the asymptotic value of the diameter (3.10) is la = r

(3.12)

b. taub-nut and taub-bolt metrics

for d = 4 the boundary at innity, which is the ber bundle of s1 over s2, may be non-

trivial if the corresponding chern number is non-zero. it is the case for the taub-nut

and taub-bolt metrics which can be present in the form [17]

ds2 = f ()(d + 2n cos d)2 +

d2
f ()

+ (2  n2)ds2

s2

,

where the metric function is

f () =

  n
 + n

(3.13)

(3.14)

since  = d  2 it seems that the regularized action (2.12) should diverge as r2. however, it
happens that for the metric (3.8) the only non-zero (growing with r) terms in the expansion (2.7) for the
area are r2 and r. therefore, the action is indeed nite.

15

for taub-nut metric and

f () =

(  n/2)(  2n)

(2  n2)

(3.15)

for taub-bolt. the euclidean time  in (3.13) should be identied with period 8n while

the angle  is identied modulo 2.

in fact one should take two dierent coordinate

patches which are non-singular at northpole ( = 0) and southpole ( = ) respectively.

the overlapping these patches gives the surface of constant  > + (+ = n for taub-

nut and + = 2n for taub-bolt) the topology of 3-sphere (with ( /(2n), , ) being euler

angles).

the manifold mr in the sequence of spaces approaching the space m is dened by

the range +    r of the radial coordinate. the square root of determinant of metric
(3.13) g = (r2  n2) sin  does not depend on the metric function f (r). therefore both

for (3.14) and (3.15) the volume of the space mr is

v (r) = 322n (

r3

)  n2(r  +)! .

the area of the boundary mr is

a(r) = 322n(r2  n2)f 1/2(r) .

within the square-root prescription (1.3) and with the calculation performed in [8] using

the ads prescription. in the later case the expressions (3.18) and (3.19) are recovered

in the limit of innite ads radius l. the dierence between (3.19) and (3.18) yields the

results of [18], [19]. on the other hand, (3.18), (3.19) agree with the much older result by

gibbons and perry [20] obtained by an imperfect match of the taub-nut solution to

euclidean at space.

c. kerr-newman metric

the euclidean kerr-newman metric parameterized by mass m, electric charge q and

the rotation parameter a takes the form

ds2 = grrdr2 + gd2 + g  d 2 + 2gtdtd + gd2

grr =

, g = 2 , g  = 2( + a2 sin2 ) ;

g  = 2 sin2 (r2  a2  ) , g = 2(cid:16)(r2  a2)2 + a2 sin2 (cid:17) sin2  ,
(r) = r2  a2  q2  2mr , 2 = r2  a2 cos2  .

(3.20)

this metric has vanishing scalar curvature although the ricci tensor vanishes only if

q = 0. the euclidean metric (3.20) can be obtained from the lorentzian metric by taking

the wick rotation of the time and supplementing this by the parameter transformation

a  a, q  q. the euclidean instanton (3.20) is regular manifold for r  r+, where
r+ = m + m2 + a2 + q2 is the positive root of equation (r) = 0, provided one made
certain identications. the angle coordinate  should be identied modulo 2. we must

also identify points (, ) with ( + 2h,  + 2h ), where

vector normal to the boundary mr has component nr = (

curvature of the boundary k = n = 1g r(gnr). for the metric hij induced on
mr we have h = g(

(3.22)

this reproduces the previous results [2], [18] obtained within the subtraction regulariza-

tion procedure.

d. flat space in spheroidal coordinates

in all examples considered so far the sequence of boundaries mr was chosen in a

natural way for given metric on manifold m. however, there, of course, exists freedom

to choose dierent shape for boundaries mr. the important question arises as how the
limiting value of the regularized action wgr[mr  m] depends on the limiting sequence
of the boundaries chosen. to address this question we consider at d-dimensional space.

in the section 3.1 we demonstrated that choosing mr to be the round (d  1)-sphere
of radius r the limiting value of the gravitational action is just zero. in this section we

want to re-calculate the action for at space choosing the set of boundaries mr to be

now sequence of spheroidal surface. we choose the spheroidal coordinates on at space

where metric reads

ds2 =

2

(r)

dr2 + 2d2 + (r) sin2 d2 + r2 cos2 ds2

sd3

,

(3.23)

where (r) = r2  a2, 2 = r2  a2 cos2 . the metric (3.23) is obtained as  = const
part of the (d + 1)-dimensional metric [21] generalizing the kerr metric by setting mass to

18

zero. it is regular if r  a. for (3.23) we have g = 2rd3 sin  cosd3 . we dene the
surface mr by equation r = const. the further calculation goes along the same lines

as for the kerr-newman metric. we have for the volume and area respectively

v (r) =

a(r) = 4d3

(3.26)

we nd that the result is dierent for wgr and w a

gr. the action wgr is less singular: the

leading term is rd6. let us concentrate on analysis of the regularized action wgr. we
observe that for d  5 the limiting value of the action is zero. this is in agreement with
our computation done in section 3.1 for the boundary being the round sphere. for d = 6

the large r behavior of the action is dominated by the constant term and the limiting
value is nite. for d  7 the gravitational action diverges as rd6. these observations
are similar to the ones made in [13]. we see that for d  6 the limiting value of the
action appears to depend on the choice of the limiting sequence of boundaries. a possible

resolution of this problem is to nd a new counterterm which may kill the leading term

the surface of constant r is spheroidal surface with curvature depending on angle . for d = 3 we

19

in (3.26). it is not dicult to nd the appropriate counterterm among terms quadratic
in the boundary curvature. indeed, the invariant s  (r2
d1r2) identically vanishes
for the round (d  1)-dimensional sphere (in this case rij = (d2)
r2 ij). moreover, its
rst variation s due to small deviation of the metric from that of the round sphere also

ij  1

identically vanishes. therefore, the geometric invariant s is non-zero only in the second

order with respect to the deformation of the metric of round sphere. the spheroidal

surface is a2-dependent deformation of the round sphere and we can expect that in the

leading order (small a or large r) the invariant s is proportional to a4. this is exactly

what we need for the cancelation of the divergence (3.26) also proportional to a4. the

detail computation shows that for large r we have

s =

(d  3)2
(d  1) (cid:16)(d  2) cos()4  2 cos()2 + (d  2)(cid:17) a4

in the boundary curvature counterterm in the ads prescription (1.2) should be noted.

4 more of boundary geometry

4.1 asymptotic geometry of ricci at space

the universality of the ads prescription (1.2) valid for any metric hij(x) on the asymp-

totic boundary of ads space is based on the possibility to well pose the dirichlet boundary

problem for the einstein equations with positive cosmological constant. indeed, the solu-

tion of the einstein equations is completely determined once one xes the induced metric

on the boundary of the space (more precisely, one needs to nd the manifold of negative

constant curvature which has a given conformal structure at innity). an existence the-

orem for such einstein metric was proved in [5]. one can explicitly obtain an asymptotic

expansion of bulk metric near innity starting from any metric at innity [6]. technically,

20

one uses the distinguished coordinate system [4] where the bulk metric takes the form

ds2 =

l2d2
42 +

1

 (cid:16)hij(x) + h(1)

ij (x) + h(2)

ij (x)2 + ...(cid:17) dxidxj

,

(4.1)

 is radial coordinate,  = 0 determines the innity of the space. once one picks the

rst term hij(x) the einstein equations determine the other terms in the -expansion,
h(1)
ij (x), h(2)

ij (x), ..., as local covariant functions of the metric hij(x). that is why the diver-

gences (due to the integration in the action over small ) of the eh action are completely

determined by the asymptotic metric hij(x) and expressed as local covariant functions of

hij(x). the idea of introducing the counterterms determined on the regularized (staying

at  = ) boundary (with boundary metric 1

 hij(x)) then appears quite naturally [7].

to what extent the same can be done in asymptotically at case? the einstein

equations then determine metric with vanishing ricci tensor. in analogy with anti-de

sitter case we can x metric hij(x) at innity of the space and try to determine the

metric in the bulk by solving the equation r = 0. in particular, we can use coordinate

system (, x) where the metric takes the form similar to (4.1)

ds2 = d2 + 2 hij(x) + h(1)

ij (x)

1


+ h(2)

ij (x)

2 + ...! dxidxj

,

(4.2)

the innity of the space is at innite value of .
[note, that the boundary area for the
metric (4.2) grows as d1 so that the metric is characterized by value  = d  1 of
the parameter  introduced in section 2.] we do not give here the detail analysis of the

problem. we just note that the bulk equations r = 0 determine not only the -evolution

of the metric (i.e. how terms in the expansion (4.2) are determined by the asymptotic

metric hij(x)) but also give constraint on the asymptotic metric hij(x). indeed, the rst

term in the series (4.2) can not be arbitrary: the bulk equations r = 0 dictate it to

satisfy the equation

rij[h] = (d  2)hij

.

(4.3)

thus, innity of ricci at space should have geometry of (d  1)-dimensional de sitter
space which we will loosely call round sphere. it is an important dierence from the anti-

de sitter case where the boundary metric can be arbitrary from given conformal class.

we may also consider the case when the boundary has topology of product of n circles s1

21

(radius of each circle approaches constant value at innity) and (d  n  1)-dimensional
surface . the parameter  = d  n  1 in this case. the bulk metric then is ricci-at
only if surface  is (d  n  1)-dimensional de sitter space.

the constraint (4.3) explains why for known examples our prescription (2.3) gives the

same result as the lau-mann prescription (1.3). in these cases the boundary is chosen

consistently with the form of the metric (4.2), i.e.

it is dened as  = r = const (the

boundary metric is r2hij(x)). from (4.3) we get that the integral in (1.3) is proportional

to the area of the boundary in the same way as in the prescription (2.3).

4.2 when boundary is not round sphere

we saw above that innity of the ricci at space has geometry of sphere sd1. there-

fore, it is distinguished choice to take boundary mr to be a round sphere. this is what

we were doing in the most examples considered above. however, we are of course free to

choose boundary to be any other closed surface , topologically equivalent to sphere. an

important question then is how much our regularization procedure is sensitive to this. in

particular, it was claimed in section 2 that the coecient c() in front of the countert-

erm (2.3) is determined only by topology but not geometry of the boundary. however,

the analysis in section 2 was done for the boundary chosen consistently with the form

of the bulk metric (2.5), i.e. dened as  = const. in ricci at case, as we just have

seen, it means that the boundary is round sphere. so, what happens if we take arbitrary

surface as the boundary? should the coecient in front of the counterterm (2.3) depend

on geometry of the surface? all these questions, in fact, challenge the universality of our

prescription. a related important question (partially addressed in section 3) concerns the

gravitational action of at space: does it universally vanish or it may take non-zero or

even innite value depending on the shape of the boundary.

analyzing this problem we consider the simplest possible case when manifold m d is at

space with cartesian coordinates {z1, z2, ..., zd}. in this space we consider the sequence

22

(4.4)

and parameterized by radius r, when r goes to innity the region mr inside the surface

(4.4) covers the whole manifold m. the parameters {ai} indicate how the surface (4.4)
deviates from the round sphere sd1 which is determined by equation (4.4) when all

ai = 1, i = 1, .., d. it should be noted that the sequence of surfaces (4.4) is quite dierent

from the spheroidal surfaces considered in section 3. the spheroidal surfaces still approach

the round sphere when radius goes to innity while the surface (4.4) remains dierent from

the round sphere even at innite r.

where d(ai) is some function of parameters {ai}. the integration in (4.7) can be per-
formed after introducing on surface (4.4) appropriate system of angle coordinates and

diers from 1 the integration can be done explicitly and we get

4(a) =

it seems that in order to cancel the divergence (4.7) with help of counterterm (2.3) we

need to assume that the coecient in front of the integral in (2.3) explicitly depends on

parameters {ai}. this would indicate that our regularization prescription (2.3) is not

the subject of this section.

universal and applies (as it stands) only to boundary which is round sphere while in more

general case the prescription should be modied appropriately to the concrete geometry

of the boundary.

it is, however, instructive to analyze the behavior of the eh action (4.5)-(4.6) and

the regularized action (2.2)-(2.3) (with c() = d  2 as it stands for the round sphere)
with respect to small deviations of parameters {ai} from 1. for simplicity, let us assume
that only two parameters a1 = a, a2 = b are dierent from 1. then up to second order in

we see that (4.11) is still divergent but it is now quadratic in (a  1) and (b  1). so,
the counterterm (2.3) cancels the large r divergence of (4.5) in the zero and rst orders in

(a  1) and (b  1)! is it possible to nd a counterterm which may cancel the divergence
(4.11) in the second order in (a  1) and (b  1)? the answer is yes. the required

24

counterterm is exactly the term (3.27) which we introduced earlier in order to cancel the

divergences for the spheroidal boundary. even the overall (dependent on dimension d)

coecient in (3.27) takes the right form. in order to prove the last statement we present
here the result of integration of the invariant s  r2

the divergence may appear only in the third and higher orders in (a  1) and (b  1).

the expressions (4.11) and (4.12) are proportional to the same symmetric combination

(d1) pi6=j(ai  1)(aj  1)] and the cancelation of the divergences is evident.

presumably, this can be continued further: we should introduce more (higher order in

the boundary curvature) counterterms in order to cancel the large r divergence in next

orders in (ai 1). what we get then is innite series of the counterterms so that the large
r divergence of the action cancels in all orders in (ai  1). this would mean that once the
gravitational action includes the whole innite series of the counterterms it vanishes for

at space for any choice of the (topologically equivalent to sphere) boundary. we expect

that structure of this innite series is universal and determined only by topology of the

boundary. it would be interesting to get more terms in this series and see if it converges

to some compact expression of the boundary curvature.
