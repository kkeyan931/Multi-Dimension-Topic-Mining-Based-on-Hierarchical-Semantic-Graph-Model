abstract

the leading long-distance 1-loop quantum corrections to the coulomb potential are derived for

scalar qed and their gauge-independence is explicitly checked. the potential is obtained from

the direct calculation of the 2-particle scattering amplitude, taking into account all relevant 1-loop

diagrams. our investigation should be regarded as a rst step towards the same programme for

eective quantum gravity. in particular, with our calculation in the framework of scalar qed,

we are able to demonstrate the incompleteness of some previous studies concerning the quantum

gravity counterpart.

1 introduction

the non-renormalizability of general relativity [1, 2] has inspired the study of various

alternative models for quantum gravity. it was soon realized that proposals based on high-

derivative local eld theories are inconsistent with the simultaneous requirements of unitarity

and renormalizability [3] (see also [4] for the discussion of the spectrum of a general high-

derivative local quantum gravity) and the main attention is now concentrated on non-local

objects like strings and p-branes. therefore, while high energy eects are described by

strings, at low energies one meets eective gravity actions, which may be the einstein-

hilbert one or include some additional elds, such as a dilaton. it was already noticed by s.

weinberg in [5] that quantum gravity based on general relativity may be consistent as a

quantum theory for the restricted low-energy domain. the idea of an eective approach to

quantum gravity was realized in a recent paper by f. donoghue [6], who used it to perform a

practical calculation of the leading long-distance quantum correction to the newton potential

4 (see also [8] for the general explanation of the eective approach). this work attracted

considerable interest and raised the hopes to apply the background of eective quantum

gravity to other problems. however, as concerning the original calculations in quantum

gravity [6], some questions still remain unanswered.

this calculation implies two important suppositions. first, one has to deal with the

separation of the long-distance eects, related to the non-local part of the eective action,

from the uv divergent pieces which may be always subtracted by adding local counterterms.

indeed, all these counterterms have plenty of higher derivatives, but they may be removed

by the renormalization of the corresponding high derivative terms in the action. these

terms, in turn, are invisible at low energies, because the corresponding degrees of freedom

have too large masses. second, some part of the long-distance contributions of the feynman

diagrams are proportional to the well-known uv divergences, and this enables one to greatly

reduce the volume of calculations [6]. this part is composed by the logarithmic (l-type in

[6]) non-analytic terms, and they come from the diagrams with only massless internal lines.

at the same time, there are other one-loop diagrams which produce, along with l-type

structures, other (s-type in [6]) non-analytic terms, and those are absolutely independent

from the uv divergences. indeed, this kind of terms gives the leading contribution to the

long-distance quantum corrections. after the original papers [6] were published, there was

a series of works devoted to their correction and checking.

in particular, [9] pointed out

the error in the calculation of the one-loop contribution to the vertex function, while [10]

found some relevant diagrams which were not accounted for in [6]5. at the same time,

4similar calculation has been done long ago by iwasaki [7].
5unfortunately, the authors of [10] did not provide sucient details of their calculation. here, we start

the analysis of the same diagrams which were considered in [10]. indeed, our consideration is going to be

more general, since we adopt a gauge-xing condition depending on an arbitrary parameter, and also present

2

[11, 12] applied functional methods for the same calculation. however, they succeeded in

extracting only the l-type non-analytic terms, which can be easily obtained from the 1-loop

logarithmic divergences. the leading s-type non-localities cannot be achieved in this way,

and it is still necessary to use diagrams. one has to notice that the s-type non-localities

appear due to the mixed loops with both massive and massless internal lines, and that the

corresponding diagrams are not subject to the appelquist-carazzone theorem [13]. indeed,

the mixed diagrams produce l-type nonlocalities, too. thus, at present, we have some set

of alternative results for the same quantity (quantum correction to the newton potential),

and they do not t with each other.

another subtle point in all the scheme is the gauge-independence of the result. for

instance, the original calculation of [6] has used the polarization operator obtained in [1], but

this is well-known to be gauge-dependent [14, 15]. one can argue that, being related to some

scattering amplitude, quantum corrections to the potential should be gauge-independent.

thus, one expects that the gauge-xing dependence of the polarization operator must cancel

the one coming from the vertex. however, the non-standard aspects of the above eective

scheme make an explicit check of the gauge-independence reasonable. we mention that such

a verication was successfully done in [11], but only for the l-type terms, while the question

for s-type terms remains open.

practical calculations in eective quantum gravity meet two kind of technical diculties.

first, there are problems with extracting the non-analytic pieces from the diagrams with

both massless and massive internal lines (s-type terms). the complexity of this operation

greatly increases with the number of massive insertions. the second problem is the huge

amount of algebraic steps which are necessary for the calculations of diagrams in quantum

gravity, especially in general non-minimal gauges. in view of this, in the present paper, we

choose as our working model scalar quantum electrodynamics (sqed), where the volume

of algebraic work is essentially reduced.

it is very important that sqed has almost all

the diagrams that one meets in quantum gravity, and also these diagrams have the same

power-counting for the ir divergences. hence, in the course of this calculation, one can

learn better how to select relevant diagrams and also develop a technique for extracting the

non-local pieces from these diagrams.

our paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we present the backgrounds of the model,

technical details. from our point of view, such a calculation is essentially non-trivial and its details should

be manifest.

including the feynman rules and derivation of the classical coulomb potential from the tree-

level amplitude. section 3 contains the full list of one-loop diagrams and their classication

with respect to the low-energy contributions. in sections 4 and 5, we present the details of the

diagrams, discuss the cancellation of their gauge-dependent parts and derive the quantum

correction to the potential. finally, we draw our conclusions in section 6. an appendix

follows, where we list the low-momentum behaviour of the 1-loop integrals.

2 feynman rules and the coulomb potential

let us consider sqed, starting from the non-invariant action with an arbitrary covariant

gauge-xing term:

(1)

here,  is the arbitrary gauge-xing parameter. in the following, we shall consider the

interaction between two heavy spinless particles of equal mass (m) and electric charge (e) due

to photon exchange. the eective interaction in the static case is achieved by evaluating the

scattering amplitude between these heavy particles in the limit of small momentum transfer,
q2  0. this is directly realized by the fact that for a potential, v , the s-matrix element is
given by

s = 1  2 (ei  ef ) < f|v |i > 2 (ei  ef )

ei  en
where ei, ef are the energies of the initial and nal asymptotic states.

< f|v |n >< n|v |i >

+ . . . ,

(2)

if we denote the incoming and the outgoing momenta of the particles 1 and 2 by p1, p2

and p3, p4 respectively, and normalize the state vector as

< p3 p4|p1 p2 >= (2)3(3)(p1  p3)(2)3(3)(p2  p4) ,

(3)

then

< p3 p4|v |p1 p2 >= (2)3(3)(p1 + p2  p3  p4)z v (r)ei~q~rd3r ;

(~q = ~p1  ~p3). (4)

in terms of the reactance matrix, the s-matrix may be parameterized as below:

sij = ij  i (2)4 (4)(pf  pi)t (~q) ,

(5)

4

yielding the following expression for the potential:

v (r) =

1

(2)3 z t (~q ) ei~q~r d3~r.

(6)

as it was already mentioned, the advantage of working with sqed is that it leads to

considerably simpler feynman rules, and presents diagrams similar to the ones appearing

in the case of quantum gravity. the feynman rules for the photon-matter vertices and

propagators for an arbitrary gauge-xing are given at fig.1:

the calculation of the tree-level graph at the static limit (fig. 2) leads us to a scattering

amplitude proportional to 1

q2 , which gives rise to the classical coulomb potential. by
virtue of the current conservation, it can be readily checked that this result is completely

independent of any gauge-xing procedure. the same can indeed be achieved by means of

the above feynman rules. the tree-level scattering amplitude has the form presented at

fig.2.

in the static limit, q0 = 0, and therefore q2 = ~q 2, after performing the fourier trans-

formation

we obtain, as expected, the coulomb potential:

z 1
~q 2 ei~q~r d3~r =

1

4r

,

v (r) = 

e2
4 r

,

(7)

(8)

which is the tree-level approximation to the potential for the interaction between two

static sources.

before going on to specic calculations, it is possible to anticipate the form of the lowest

order quantum corrections to the coulomb potential, based upon dimensional analysis:

v (r) = 

e2

r (cid:18)1 + h e2 


r

+ h e2 

r2(cid:19) ,

(9)

where  and  are to be extracted from the loop diagrams and exhibit mass dimensions
(1) and (2), respectively.

3 one-loop diagrams

now, our task is to extract quantum corrections to the non-relativistic potential coming from

quantum uctuations of the both vector and scalar elds. let us stress that the contributions

from massive scalars cannot be disregarded, unless they form a closed loop without the

5

massless vector insertions. in fact, the only way to distinguish the relevant and non-relevant

diagrams is to check whether the graph has ir divergence whenever the momentum transfer

~q goes to zero. only if the diagram has analytic behaviour in this limit, it can be left away.

this selection rule exactly corresponds to the result of [13]. in this point, we agree with

some of the previous publications [6, 9, 10] and disagree with others: [11] and [12], where

scalars were taken as purely classical sources. we shall consider the interaction induced by

1-loop contributions to the scattering amplitude between two heavy scalar particles of equal

mass, m. the eective interaction in the static limit is then determined by evaluating the
scattering amplitude, to order e4, in the limit of very small momentum transfer, ~q 2  0. in
order to extract low-energy quantum corrections, the amplitudes are computed in momentum

space as functions of the total momentum transfer, ~q2. to nd such non-analytic terms, it

is necessary to separate the uv nite pieces of the one-loop integrals, for instance by using

dimensional regularisation [16]. this nite part contains all information concerning low-

energy behaviour of the amplitude, while the ultraviolet divergences have local structure

and one can disregard them, having in mind that they may be suitably renormalized.

in order to calculate the loop integrals, we have used the feynman parametric representa-

tion for combining propagator denominators. the nal answer then follows after performing

the necessary momentum and parametric integrations, which are done by heavily making

use of the software maple v.

for small ~q2 , the leading contributions arising from each diagram can then be separated

into two types of terms, namely, ln (~q 2) and 2 m~q
mixed massive-massless loops. the corrections to the potential, in coordinate space, come

2 , the latter coming exclusively from

from momentum space calculations by the use of the fourier transformations [6] similar to

the full set of the potentially relevant diagrams is presented in fig. 3. one can classify
all those diagrams using the non-analyticity at q  0 as a criterium. the rst group of
graphs includes (2a), (2b) and (2c), and their respective permutations of external legs, which

really contribute to the potential in the static limit. these diagrams will be considered in

details in the next section. the second group is composed by the graphs (2d),(2e) and
(2f). one of these diagrams, (2d), has analytic behaviour at q2  0 , because it displays

6

only massive particles inside the loop. the contribution of this diagram at q2  0 is
proportional to ln(m2) and therefore does not contribute to the long-distance force. the

diagrams (2g) and (2i) have infrared divergences, but these divergences do not depend on

the momentum transfer and thus do not contribute to the long-distance force. this is the

usual soft photons situation, and it can be, for instance, treated by adding constant ir

divergent counterterms [17]. for the sake of compactness, in what follows we do not consider

these trivial ir divergences, because they cancel after summing up all graphs. the third

group consists of the diagrams depicted in figs. (2g) and its permutative brothers. they

do not lead to any contribution in the limit of low momentum transfer, as they are just a

quantum correction to the the tree graph of figure 4, and they are therefore subject to the

same kinematic restriction.

the diagram of figure 4 describes annihilation of two massive particles into a virtual

photon with its subsequent decay, creating another massive pair. obviously, the momentum
transfer satises the energy condition ~q 2  2m2. clearly, this diagram vanishes for low-
momentum transfers and therefore does not contribute to the long-distance force.

a major concern, which arises when throwing away such a family of dierent diagrams,

is the gauge-invariance of the entire set of diagrams. it is not a priory established whether,

or not, this symmetry is preserved if we adopt this usual denition of potential.

4 calculation of the relevant diagrams

now, using the feynman rules given above, together with the appropriate mass-shell condi-

tions, we can derive the contributions to the scattering amplitudes from each of the relevant

graphs. the mass-shell conditions for the external momenta and momentum transfer have

the form:

p1  p3 = q  p1  p3 = p2  p4 = m2 
q2
2

p1  q = p2  q = p3  q = p4  q =

q2
2

,

,

q2
p1  p2 = p3  p4 = m2 
2
p1  p4 = p3  p2 = m2 .

,

(12)

now, based on our analysis of the previous section, let us consider only the diagrams

(2a)  (2e) which have essential non-analytic parts. the expression for the diagram (2b) is

7

the easiest to compute, because it includes only two massless propagators.

in all the integrals proportional to the gauge-xing factors, (1 + ) and (1 + )2, it can

be checked that one term in the numerator of the integrand always cancels the massive

propagators, by using the mass-shell conditions. in order to see these cancellations, one has
to notice that the term (p1 + p3  k)(k  q) is equal to k2  2k  p1, which is exactly
the denominator of the massive propagator, due to the mass-shell relation p2
1 = m2. in the
next integrals for this graph, one can also use the relation k  (2p1  k) = (k  p1)2  m2.
one should notice that also (p2 + p4 + k)(k  q) equals to k2  2k  p2. so, by using the
expressions (12), we arrive at the following expressions for the diagrams:

one can notice that the expressions for the gauge-dependent integrals look very similar.

our procedure to show the gauge-independence consists in grouping together all the integrals

proportional to (1 + ) and (1 + )2, without solving them explicitly. after that, we just

make use of the on-shell conditions and make some momentum redenitions in order to check

that the overall expression vanishes. so, we expand, for arbitrary ,

t (q) = t0(q) + (1 + )t1(q) + (1 + )2t2(q) ,

(20)

and write, using previous expressions for the diagrams, t1 and t2 as follows:

by analyzing these expressions, it is possible to eliminate integrals of the form

or

z (p2 + p4)  k
kn(k  q)m

because the sum will depend linearly on q. one can readily see that (p1 + p3)  q = 0 and
(p2 + p4)  q = 0, for q = p1  p3 = p4  p2. the same argument may be applied to similar
terms, like (p2 + p4)  (k  q) , where after the shift of momentum, k  k + q , we arrive at

as we can see, it is possible to demonstrate the complete cancellations of the gauge-xing

dependence in the denition of the potential. it is not necessary to solve the dimensional

10

(23)

(24)

regularization integrals explicitly, but only search for convenient simplication using on-shell

conditions for the external legs. this relatively easy way of canceling non-physical contribu-

tions to the potential is not so obvious when treating the same problem in quantum gravity,

which is indeed our major concern. we believe that cancellations in sqed are, anyway, a

good sign for the gravity counterpart. at least, now it is possible to set the denition of

the potential as the non-relativistic limit of scattering amplitude of the 1 particle-irreducible

graphs, and our method for treating the non-analytic pieces is consistent with the (expected)

gauge-independence. also, the cancellation of the gauge-dependent integrals coming from

various diagrams conrms that the set of these diagrams is complete and none of them has

been lost.

5 calculation of the physical potential

grouping the remaining part of the scattering amplitudes in order to extract the quantum

corrections to the classical coulomb potential, we have:

to extract the non-analytic terms, one can isolate the nite part of the integrals with

the help of the dimensional regularization scheme. the integrals coming from 2 massless

particles in the loop are relatively easy to perform; the integrals with one extra massive

propagator, which are related to loops with 3 internal lines, are much more dicult.

it

was crucial for their solution the use of computer algebra techniques, once we are left with

2 feynman parametric integrals, which are in general very complicated to be analytically

solved. it was obtained, in these terms, the leading quantum corrections: the ones that are

11

really important in the limit of small momentum transfer. as for the integrals with four

dierent propagators, 2 massless and 2 massive o-shell particles, this was really a dicult

task: the direct integrals over the feynman parameters were impossible to be solved and the

calculatio required additional eorts.

our way out to the problem was based upon the assumption that the static potential

should not, in principle, be dependent on velocities. then, afterwards, we might choose the

most convenient external momentum conguration considering its conservation in each vertex

separately. this treatment was useful to calculate the loop integrals with four propagators.

the conguration adopted is the one depicted in the diagram of fig. 2.

for that conguration, we could nd an appropriate partial fraction decomposition for

the 4-propagator integrals, and the results are given in appendix.

another important remark is that some integrals may immediately be disregarded, be-

cause they do not present the non-analytic contributions. it is rather easy to show that the
integrands with k2 or (k  q)2 in the numerator do not depend on q2, and so they have no
contributions at all for the potential. this is so because these same terms appears in the

denominator, representing massless propagators, and consequently simplifying them, we are

left with q2-independent integrals. let us now put everything together, collecting the results

from all integrals we have done, where we have considered only the leading ir quantum

corrections. after that, we re-express the nal expression in coordinate space by means of

the fourier transforms (15), (16), which provides the following potential:

v (r) =

1
r

+

5

484

e2
m2

after restoring the powers of h and c, we arrive at the nal expression

v (r) = 

e2

r   1

642

r

+

e2 l2
c

r2 ! ,

(26)

where lc = h

m c is the parameter of typical length scale which shows up due to the existence
of the mass parameter in sqed. we remark that such a parameter is absent in quantum

gravity. one can see, from this potential, that, contrary to the low-energy quantum gravity

calculations to newtons potential, here all quantum corrections contain the factors of h

hidden in lc. indeed, lc is compton wave length at which the quantum contributions to

the potential become signicant. in quantum gravity, there are two dierent scales, namely

the schwarzschild radius (for the rst type corrections) and the planck length, for quantum

corrections coming from the l-type ir non-local terms.

12

in sqed, as we can see, there is only one scale for quantum corrections.

6 conclusions

we have calculated the low-energy quantum corrections to the coulomb potential in sqed.

despite it is a renormalizable theory, sqed mimics most of the properties of the eective

eld theory for quantum gravity. we have checked that it is really possible to separate dif-

ferent scales for the theory. then, we might say that this low-energy physics is completely

independent from any high-energy renormalization parameters. as it was expected in [6], do

not depend on the uv divergences, and the low-energy quantum predictions can be made in

the framework of eective eld theories. in the sqed case, which is a renormalizable quan-

tum eld theory, it is its own low-energy eective theory, but one might hope to realize the

same programme for quantum gravity. in particular, this concerns the gauge-independence

of the quantum corrections to the potential, which has just been demonstrated for the sqed

case. we remark that, unlike the previous investigation [11], our calculations concern all the

relevant diagrams, even those which have internal massive lines. indeed, for the contribu-

tions of the massless loops, the same results may be easily achieved by means of functional

methods. for instance, since the uv and ir divergences are proportional in the massless

case (momentum transfer playing the role of the regularization parameter in ir), one can

simply apply the on-shell gauge independence of the one-loop divergences (see, for example,

[18] or simplied 1-loop proof in [15]). for the more complicated s-type non-localities, feyn-

man diagrams still remain the important tool, and we now hope to apply it for the quantum

gravity case.

7 appendix

here, we present the loop integrals which were used throughout our work. all the integrals

with two and three propagator can be taken directly through the feynman parameter method

(see [16] for a review on dimensional regularizaion).

let us comment on the derivation of integrals with four propagators. one can always

decompose the integrand into partial fractions, containing 3 propagators each, as indicated

below:

q2

k2(k  q)2[(k  p)2  m2][(k + p  q)2  m2]

integrating the rst two terms we do not obtain any non-analytical contribution, and

consequently our interest is restricted to the last two terms. they can be, in turn, calcu-

lated using feynman parameters and maple v. all the resulting integrals required for our

calculation are displayed below. one has to notice that these expresions contain only the

non-analytic parts of the integrals. also, we have omitted the trivial infrared divergences,

mentioned in section 4.
