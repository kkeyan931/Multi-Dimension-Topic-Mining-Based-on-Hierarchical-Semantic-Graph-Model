liouville bootstrap via harmonic analysis on a

noncompact quantum group

b. ponsot, j. teschner

abstract. the purpose of this short note is to announce results that amount to a veri-
cation of the bootstrap for liouville theory in the generic case under certain assumptions
concerning existence and properties of fusion transformations. under these assumptions
one may characterize the fusion and braiding coecients as solutions of a system of
functional equations that follows from the combination of consistency requirements and
known results. this system of equations has a unique solution for irrational central
charge c > 25. the solution is constructed by solving the clebsch-gordan problem for
a certain continuous series of quantum group representations and constructing the as-
sociated racah-coecients. this gives an explicit expression for the fusion coecients.
moreover, the expressions can be continued into the strong coupling region 1 < c < 25,
providing a solution of the bootstrap also for this region.

1. introduction
liouville theory or close relatives of it such as the h +

3 or sl(2)/u (1) wznw models play
a central role in a variety of string-theoretical or gravitational models. these models are
simple enough to justify the hope for exact results yet rich enough to capture some important
aspects of the physics of strings on nontrivial (maybe curved) backgrounds. from another
point of view, these are the natural starting points for beginning to investigate noncompact
conformal eld theories (cft), i.e. cft with a continuous spectrum of primary elds. this
has motivated a lot of eort towards the exact solution of these models.

both from the point of view of applications and of the intrinsic structure of the cft one
may consider the determination of the spectrum virasoro-representations and of the three
point function to be central objectives. concerning the former, a reasonable conjecture was
obtained in the early work [1] (stated in (1) below). as far as the three point function is
concerned, important progress was initiated by the papers [3, 4] where an explicit formula
was proposed and checked in various ways. a method to derive this formula from conditions
of consistency of the bootstrap with a spectrum as proposed in [1] was subsequently given
in [6]. further conrmation from a path-integral point of view was more recently given in
[7].

given knowledge of conformal symmetry, spectrum and three point functions one has in
principle an unambigous construction for any genus zero correlation function by summing
over intermediate states. but the decomposition of a n-point function as sum over three
point functions can in general be performed in dierent ways. equality of the expressions
resulting from dierent such decompositions ( locality, crossing symmetry) can be seen as
being the most dicult sucient condition to verify for showing consistency of the cft as
characterized by spectrum and three point functions.

the present note will outline an approach to verify the consistency of the bootstrap with
spectrum and three point functions as proposed in [1, 3, 4]. the main assumption underlying
our approach is the existence of duality transformations for generic conformal blocks that
are consistent with (at least part of) the spectrum being continuous. it is explained that
the coecients that describe these transformations will then be severely constrained by
consistency conditions of moore-seiberg [8][9] type.
in fact, taking into account known
results on fusion of degenerate virasoro-representations with generic ones one may derive a
system of functional equations for the fusion coecients. for irrational central charge c > 25
it is possible to show that this system of functional equations has at most one solution.

in order to solve these conditions, the ansatz is made that the fusion coecients should be
essentially given as racah-coecients for an appropriate continuous series of representations
of uq(sl(2, r)), with deformation parameter q = exp(ib2), related to the central charge
c > 25 of the virasoro algebra via c = 1 + 6(b + b1)2. this is motivated by the long
history of research on connections between liouville theory and quantum groups going back
to [10, 11, 12] and more recently in particular [13, 14, 15]. the set of quantum group
representations considered here is unusual, however:
it is neither of lowest nor highest
weight, but rather similar to the principal continuous series of representations of sl(2, r).
racah-coecients are constructed from the solution of the clebsch-gordan problem for these
representations, explicitly calculated and shown to provide a solution of all the conditions
from liouville theory discussed previously. in particular, the clebsch-gordan calculus yields
orthogonality relations for the racah-coecients which are just what is needed to establish
crossing symmetry of general four point functions constructed in terms of the spectrum and
the three point functions proposed in [1, 3, 4].

it is worth noting that the quantum group we are discussing has no proper classical
counterpart, which is related to a remarkable self-duality under replacing the deformation
parameter q = exp(ib2) by q = exp(ib2). this symmetry directly corresponds to the
symmetry of liouville theory under b  b1 which is natural from the point of view of the
bootstrap1 and encoded in the three point functions of [3, 4]. 2 moreover, this duality ensures
that all the relevant properties of the fusion coecients will remain true when continuing to
|b| = 1, corresponding to the strong coupling region 1 < c < 25. the present work thus also
veries the conjecture of [4] that the bootstrap remains consistent for 1 < c < 25 when using
the obvious continuations of the spectrum and the three point functions that were proposed
in [1, 3, 4].

most of our results are only announced in the present note. more details and rigorous
proofs of our quantum group results will appear in a series of publications in preparation
[16, 17, 18].

2. bootstrap for liouville theory

the possibility to preserve conformal invariance as a symmetry in the quantization of
liouville theory [1][19] suggests to use the bootstrap formalism [20] as rened in [8][9] in order
to exploit the information about correlation functions that is provided by this symmetry
most eciently.

conformal invariance requires that the hilbert-space h decomposes as direct sum (or
integral) over tensor products v  v  of highest weight representations of the left/right
virasoro algebras. the label  is related to the highest weight h() of the representation
v via h() = (q  ) where q = b + b1 is related to the central charge c of the virasoro
algebra via c = 1+6q2. arguments based on canonical quantization suggest [1] the following
spectrum for liouville theory:

(1)

h =z 

s

d v  v.

s =

q
2

+ ir+

accordingly the spectrum is expected to be simple, purely continuous and diagonal.

h0|qn

the main object of interest are correlation functions of virasoro primary elds v(z),
z  c with conformal dimension h(). only the genus zero case will be considered in
the present paper.
it should be possible to evaluate any correlation function such as
i=1 vi (zi)|0i by summing over intermediate states, leading to a representation of that
correlation function in terms of the matrix elements h3, d3|v2 (z)|1, d1i. the sum over
intermediate states splits into integrations over the intermediate representations and sum-
mations over vectors within xed intermediate representations v  v. the contributions
for xed intermediate representations turn out to be uniquely given by conformal symme-
try in terms of the matrix elements c(q  3, 2, 1)  h3|v2 (1)|1i between highest
i=1 vi (zi)|0i

weight states h3| and |1i. in the example of the four point function h0|q4

one thereby arrives at a representation of the form

remark 1. one should note that the set s43|21 that appears in (2) will in general not coincide
with the spectrum [21]. this will only be the case when the states v2 (z2)v1 (z1)|0i and
h0|v4 (z4)v3 (z3) (suitably smeared over z4, . . . , z1) are normalizable, which one indeed

4

b. ponsot, j. teschner

expects [21]3 to be the case if the parameters 4, . . . , 1 satisfy

(4)

2|re(1 + 2  q)| < q
2|re(3 + 4  q)| < q

2|re(1  2)| < q
2|re(3  4)| < q.

otherwise one can have contributions from intermediate representations that do not belong
to s, but are well-dened and uniquely determined by considering the analytic continuation
of expression (2) from (4) to generic complex 4, . . . , 1, as was explained in the example of
the h +
3 -wznw model in [5]. it will therefore not be a loss of generality to restrict attention
to the range (4) where one indeed has s43|21 = s.

the second basic property that the operators v(z) are required to satisfy is mutual
locality [v(z), v(w)] = 0 for z 6= w. it follows that the four point function can alternatively
be represented e.g. as

h0|v4 (z4) . . . v1 (z1)|0i =

where the t-channel4 conformal blocks are given by power series similar to (3) with z replaced
by 1  z.

equality of expressions (2) and (5) can be considered as an innite system of equations
32 given by conformal symmetry.

for the data c(3, 2, 1) and s with coecients f s
as means for the practical determination of these data it is useless, though.

21 , f t

it turns out, however, that the explicit form of the c(3, 2, 1) can be determined by
considering certain special cases of these conditions where the conformal blocks are known
explicitely [6]. under certain assumptions one nds the formula previously proposed in [3, 4]
as unique solution:

c(3, 2, 1) =(cid:20)

b(1 + 2 + 3  q)b(1 + 2  3)b(1 + 3  2)b(2 + 3  1)

,

where a denition of the function b(x) can be found in the appendix.

the main problem that needs to be solved in order to put the bootstrap onto rmer ground
is the verication that locality (or crossing symmetry) is indeed satised when c(3, 2, 1)
as given in (6) and s as given in (1) are used in the construction of correlation functions.
at this point we need to introduce our fundamental assumption:

conjecture 1. there exist invertible fusion-transformations between s- and t-channel con-
formal blocks:

4 1 ](z) =zs

d32 f2132 [ 3 2

4 1 ] f t

32 [ 3 2

4 1 ](z).

this conjecture is supported by an explicit calculation in a case with a special choice of
4, . . . , 1, but arbitrary 21 where an explicit expression is available thanks to the work of
a. neveu (unpublished).

3this can be alternatively found by considering asymptotics of wave-functions in some rened version of

the canonical quantization of [1], as will be explained in more detail elsewhere

4the superscript s and t refer to s- and t-channel respectively

coecients for fusion-products of representations of the virasoro-algebra.

we will now restrict attention to i  s until the end of this section. this will not be
a loss of generality since it will turn out that the general case can be obtained by analytic
continuation. the requirement can then be rewritten as the system of equations

this may be brought into a more suggestive form by absorbing (part of) the factors

of normalisation of the chiral vertex operators): let

uq(sl(2, r)) and furthermore (b) deriving the relevant orthogonality relations from complete-
ness of the clebsch-gordan decomposition for tensor products of these representations.

3. difference equations for the fusion coefficients

it will be assumed that the conformal blocks for any n-point function can be constructed
in terms of chiral vertex operators. one therefore nds as in [8][9] that the fusion coecients

6

b. ponsot, j. teschner

have to satisfy a system of consistency conditions called hexagon and pentagon equations.
here we will be particularly interested in the pentagon equation which takes the form

2 2 ] = f21 [ 4 3

2 1 ]

the rst crucial observation to be made at this point is that the fusion coecients should
have certain analyticity properties in the dependence on its six complex parameters. note
that the coecients f s
21,n that appear in the power series representation of conformal blocks
(3) depend polynomially on the variables 4, . . . , 1 and rationally on , with poles only at
the values 2 = m,n = mbnb1 and q = m,n. if the series (3) converges5 it follows
that the dependence of f s
21 on the variables 4, . . . , 1 must be entire analytic, whereas
the -dependence will be meromorphic with poles only at the locations given previously.
the compatibility of the existence of fusion transformations (7), analyticity properties of
conformal blocks and remark 1 suggests (see [18] for more discussion) the following conjec-
ture:

conjecture 2. the fusion coecients f2132(cid:2)3

4

0 <re(2 + 3 + 23  q) < q
0 <re(2 + 3  23) < q
0 <re(23 + 3  2) < q
0 <re(23 + 2  3) < q

(14)

1(cid:3) are holomorphic in

0 <re(4 + 1 + 23  q) < q
0 <re(4 + 1  23) < q
0 <re(23 + 4  1) < q
0 <re(23 + 1  4) < q

second, one may observe that the fusion transformations (7) simplify if one of 4, . . . , 1
is taken to be  = m,n = mb  nb1, corresponding to a degenerate representation of
the virasoro algebra. conformal blocks f s
 then only exist for a nite number of
values of 21, 32, so that the fusion coecients form a nite dimensional matrix [20]. it
will suce to consider cases where one of 4, . . . , 1, say 2, equals b or b1. in that
case s-channel conformal blocks f s
21 exist only for  = 1  sb, s = , 0, +, and t-channel
conformal blocks for  = 3  sb, s = , 0, +. moreover, it is easy to show that the fusion
coecients that appear in such cases can all be uniquely expressed in terms of the following
elementary ones: let

where

s, s = +, 

the matrix fs,s can be calculated explicitely [19][20]. the corresponding matrix gs,s (cf.
(11)) is then given by

if one then considers the pentagon equation (13) in the special cases where one of
5, . . . , 1 equals b, one nds a set of linear nite dierence equations for the general

1(cid:3) are functions of the conformal dimensions

only, so must be unchanged under i  q  i, i = 1, 2, 3, 4 and j  q  j, j = 1, 2.

in the case of real irrational b it is possible to show (details will appear in [18]) uniqueness
of a solution to this system of functional equations, taking into account the analytic prop-
erties of the fusion coecients. in fact, the equations (17) are second order homogeneous
nite dierence equations. it can be shown that the second order equations of the form
(17) together with their b  b1 duals can have at most two linearly independent solutions
with the required analytic properties. taking into account the symmetry i  q  i,
i = 1, . . . , 4 will determine the dependence w.r.t. i, i = 1, . . . , 4 up to a factor that de-
pends on 21 and 32. the remaining freedom is then xed by considering equations (18)
and its counterpart with shifts of 32.

remark 3. loosely speaking the message is the following: if there exist fusion transforma-
tions of conformal blocks that are compatible with the expectations from other approaches
(encoded in conjectures 1 and 2; cf. remark 1) then they are unique for real, irrational b.

remark 4. one might also be interested in the possibility of having fusion transformations

of the form (7) but with coecients f21,32(cid:2)3

4, . . . , 1 and 21, 32. but if one then only requires e.g. continuity in some interval such
as (14) one still has the above result on uniqueness, which together with the results to be
discussed below put one back precisely into the situation considered here.

the operators e, f , k are unbounded. they will be dened on domains consisting of func-
tions which possess an analytic continuation into the strip {x  c; |im(x)| < b
2 } and which
have suitable decay properties at innity. it may be shown that the representations p,
  s are unitarily equivalent to a subset of the integrable (well-behaved) representations
of uq(sl(2, r)) classied in [23]. it follows in particular that e, f and k become self-adjoint
on suitable domains.

remark 5. the representations considered here form a subset of the representations of
uq(sl(2, r)) that appear in the classication of [23]. this subset is distinguished by the
fact that it is simultaneously a representation of uq(sl(2, r)), q = exp(ib2) with gener-
ators e, f , k being realized by replacing b  b1 in the expressions for e, f , k given
above. restriction to these representations is crucial for obtaining a quantum group struc-
ture which is self-dual under b  b1, as liouville theory is. the price to pay is that the
representations p do not have classical (b  0) counterparts.

tensor products p2  p1 of representations can be dened by means of the co-product:

(22)

(k) = k  k

(e) = e  k 1 + k  e

(f ) = f  k 1 + k  f

it is remarkable and nontrivial that the subset of self-dual integrable representations

5. space of functions on the quantum group

the following section may be skipped by readers interested mainly in liouville theory.
it is important, however, for the deeper mathematical understanding why there is such
a remarkable non-classical category of representations. an explanation can be given by
constructing the associated dual object (a suitable space of functions on the corresponding
quantum group) and studying its harmonic analysis. details will be given in [16].

dene operators a, b, c, d on l2(r  r) by the expressions

(36)

a =u 1
1
c =v1

b =v1u2
d =u1(1 + qu2v 2

1 ).

uj =e2bxj
vj =e b

2 pj

[xi, pj] = ii,j

j = 1, 2

this is known to generate an integrable operator representation of the algebra pol(slq(2, r))
[23]. in particular, the operators a, b, c, d all have self-adjoint extensions and one has the
relations

(37)

ab =qba

ac =qca

db =q1bd
dc =q1cd

adqbc = 1
adda = (q  q1)bc.

again it is worth noting that restriction to the integrable representations of pol(slq(2, r))
from [23] in which a, b, c, d have positive spectrum already represents a point of departure
from classical sl(2, r) 7, but has the desired feature of being simultaneously a representation
of the (b  b1)-dual algebra pol(slq(2, r)). the algebra generated by positive selfadjoint
hilbert space operators a, b, c, d with relations (37) will be denoted pol(sl+

q (2, r)).

let a be the norm closure of the set c

c (sl+

q (2, r)) of all operators on l2(r  r) of the

form

(38)

o[f ] =zr

where the so-called symbol f (r, s|x) is smooth and of compact support in its dependence of
the variable x, and of paley-wiener class (entire analytic, rapid decay) w.r.t. the variables
r and s. a is then a nonunital c-algebra generated by elements a, b, c, d aliated with
a in the sense of woronowicz [25, 26].

on the hopf-algebra pol(slq(2, r)) one has natural analogues of left- and right regular
representation dened by means of the duality between pol(slq(2, r)) and uq(sl(2, r)),

7the spectrum does not cover the group manifold.

this inner product is such that the operators el, fl, kl and er, fr, kr are symmetric.

theorem 2. one has the following decomposition of l2(sl+
sentations of uq(sl(2, r))l  uq(sl(2, r))r:

q (2, r)) into irreducible repre-

one of the authors (j.t.) has partial results that strongly support the conjecture that the

co-product exists on the hilbert-space level in the sense of [25].

remark 6. one obtains representations of uq(sl(2, r))l  uq(sl(2, r))r by symmetric opera-
tors el, fl, kl and er, fr, kr also if one chooses the measure in (41) to be exp(2(b + k
b )x).
the choice k = 0 in particular reproduces the haar-measure on classical sl(2, r). for the
present choice k = 1 one looses the correspondence to any classical object but gains the
self-duality b  b1.

6. calculation of racah coefficients

the direct calculation of the racah coecients from the clebsch-gordan maps looks
dicult. a small trick helps. if one xes the values of three of the four variables x4, . . . , x1
in (34) one obtains an integral transformation for a function of a single variable. in fact,
the analytic properties of s
32 even allow to choose complex values. it will be

the integral representing the racah-wigner coecients is of the type of a barnes integral
for a 4f3 b-hypergeometric function.

7. funcional equations for racah-wigner coefficients

there is a family of nite-dimensional representations of uq(sl(2, r))uq(sl(2, r)) labelled
by two positive integers n, m. the generators e, f, k and e, f , k are realized on vector
spaces pn,m of polynomials in the variables u and u = e2b1x by means of the restriction

of the expressions (19) to q   =  n
be the pair of two-dimensional representations p1,0 and p0,1, from which all representations
pn,m can be generated by repeated tensor products. the decomposition of tensor products of
representations p1,0 or p0,1 with a generic representation p into irreducible representations
can be determined purely algebraically:

8. discussion

the results of the present paper amount to a verication of consistency of the bootstrap
for liouville theory under the assumptions on existence and properties of fusion coecients
discussed in sections 2 and 3.

it should be emphasized that characterizing the fusion coecients as racah-coecients
for a quantum group will be important beyond the task of veryifying the consistency of
previous results on three point function and spectrum of liouville theory. it also allows one
to complete the bootstrap for the associated boundary problem (liouville theory on the strip
or half-plane) that was begun in [28] and should have important applications to d-brane
physics on the associated noncompact backgrounds. specically, it was observed by one of
us (j.t.) more than two years ago that the three point function for boundary operators can
be expressed in terms of the fusion coecients, which was one of the main motivations for
undertaking the present investigation.

in fact, due to the close relationship between liouville theory and the h +

3 or sl(2)/u (1)
wznw models it should now not be too dicult to generalize our methods to obtain similar
results for these models. for example, an exact investigation of eective eld theories on
d-branes in ads3 similar to what was done in [29, 30] is now within reach.

our results may also be interesting from the mathematical point of view. the list of
examples for non-compact quantum groups where results on the harmonic analysis are known
is rather short [31, 32, 33]. in fact, the deformation of classical groups to quantum groups
often meets subtle obstacles [25]. here we have found an example which is not a deformation
of a classical group but in some respects looks particularly nice (self-duality).

we would nally like to mention that there seem to be rather interesting connections
of the present work to other approaches to liouville theory, namely the liouville model
on the lattice [34] and quantization of teichmuller space [35, 36]. in fact, in all cases the
special function sb(x) (called quantum dilogarithm there) as well as the duality b  b1
play crucial roles. making contact with the quantization of teichmuller space [35, 36] will
require diagonalization of nite dierence operators of similar form as have appeared in the
present work [37].

9. appendix: special functions

the basic building block for the class of special functions to be considered is the the double
gamma function introduced by barnes [22], see also [38]. the double gamma function is
dened as

(54)

log 2(s|1, 2) =  

t



xn1,n2=0

(s + n11 + n22)t!t=0

.

let b(x) = 2(x|b, b1), and dene the double sine function sb(x) and the upsilon function
b(x) respectively by

(55)

sb(x) =

b(x)

b(q  x)

b(x) = b(x)b(q  x).

it will also be useful to introduce

(56)

gb(x) = e

i

2 x(xq)sb(x).

liouville bootstrap via harmonic analysis on a noncompact quantum group 15

the b-hypergeometric function will be dened by an integral representation that resembles

the barnes integral for the ordinary hypergeometric function:

(57)

fb(, ; ; y) =

1
i

sb()

sb()sb()z i

i

ds e2isy sb( + s)sb( + s)
sb( + s)sb(q + s)

,

where the contour is to the right of the poles at s =   nb  mb1 s =   nb  mb1
and to the left of the poles at s = nb + mb1 s = q   + nb + mb1, n, m = 0, 1, 2, . . . . the
function fb(, ; ; ix) is a solution of the q-hypergeometric dierence equation

(58)

(cid:0)[x + ][x + ]  e2bx[x][x +   q](cid:1)fb(, ; ; ix) = 0,

this denition of a q-hypergeometric function is closely related to the one rst given in [39].
there is also a kind of deformed euler-integral for the hypergeometric function [39]:

x = 1

2 x

(59)

b(, ; ; x) =

1

i z i

i

ds e2is gb(s + x)gb(s +   )
gb(s + x + )gb(s + q)

the precise relation between b and fb is

(60)

b(, ; ; x) =

gb()gb(  )

gb()

fb(, ; ; x),

x = x  1

2 (     + q).
