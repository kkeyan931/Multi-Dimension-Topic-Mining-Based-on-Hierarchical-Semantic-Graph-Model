abstract

we examine the solutions of world-volume action for a d3-brane being
put near other d3-brane which is replaced by the background conguration
of bulk space. it is shown that the bps solutions are not aected by the d3-
brane background, and they are interpreted as dyonic strings connecting two
branes. on the contrary, the non-bps congurations are largely inuenced
by the background d-brane, and we nd that the solutions with pure electric
charge cannot connect two branes. these solutions are corresponding to the
bound state of brane and anti-brane which has been found by callan and
maldacena.

1 introduction

recently, classical solutions of the born-infeld (bi) action, which is considered
as the world-volume action of the d-brane, have been studied [1, 2, 3, 4] in the
at background-space. they are classied into the bps and non-bps solutions.
the stable bps solutions are interpreted as the strings which connect two d-branes
separated by the innite distance. while the non-bps solutions are not protected
from the dynamical uctuations since they are not supersymmetric one. among
them, non-bps solutions with pure electric charge have attracted an attention [1].
it can be regarded as the half-part of the string which connects brane and anti-brane
with a nite distance to form a bound state of them. the stability of such a non-bps
conguration has been studied from a viewpoint of the quantum mechanics [1, 5].

it will be interesting to examine these solutions from a viewpoint of the su(n)
yang-mills theory which can be constructed by the stack of d3-branes.
in this
direction, some progress has been given by studying the world-volume action of test
brane embedded in the background of d-branes [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. the situation of
the symmetry breaking su(n)  su(n  1)  u(1) is realized by setting one of
the branes far away from the others. then we can say that the classical solutions
of the world-volume action represent the soliton solutions such as monopoles or
dyons appearing in the non-abelian yang-mills theory. it would be meaningful to
study the non-bps solutions which are non-supersymmetric solution obtained in the
background of the type-iib superstring theory, because they are expected to play
some role in the non-supersymmetric yang-mills theory.

the purpose of this paper is to study the classical solutions of the world-volume
action in a situation that the test d-brane is set parallel to a background d-brane(s).
in the next section, the model is given. and in section 3.1, we show the bps and
non-bps dyonic solutions in the at background. in sections 3.2 and 4, we solve the
case of the d-brane background. we nd that the bps solutions are not aected by
the background, but the conguration of non-bps solutions are inuenced by the
background. especially, the pure electric solutions cannot reach at the position of
the background brane(s). conclusions are given in the nal section.

2 d-brane action to be solved

even if we consider the supersymmetric case, the fermionic coordinates are not
necessary to obtain a classical solution of the d-brane action. so we neglect them,
and the bosonic part of the eective action of a d-p-brane being coupled to the
background can be written as follows,

sp+1 = tpz dp+1(eqdet(g + f) +

1

(p + 1)!

i1 ip+1ai1 ip+1)

(1)

where tp denotes the tension of the d-p-brane and
f = a  a

(2)

is the eld strength of u(1) gauge eld living in the world volume. we also neglect
here the antisymmetric tensor bm n , which should be added to f, since the brane

1

considering here has no ns-ns charge. the metric g and the (p + 1)-form are the
pullback of the space-time metric gm n and the r-r (p + 1)-form respectively,

g = gm n x m x n

ai1 ip+1 = i1x m1    ip+1x mp+1am1 mp+1.

(3)

(4)

the embedding of the world volume into the target space is described by x m ()
as a function of the p + 1 dimensional world-volume coordinates .

our purpose is to solve the equations of motion for the above action sp+1 under
the target space conguration for , gm n and am1 mp+1, which are obtained as the
d-p-brane conguration by solving the ten-dimensional supergravitational theory.
before solving the equations of d-brane action in this way, we briey review the
d-brane congurations.

they are obtained by solving the supergravity eective action corresponding to
the superstring theory [11, 12]. the bosonic part of the low energy eective action
in d-dimensional 3 target space can be written as

sd = z ddxg(e2(cid:18)r + 4()2 

1
12

h 2

3(cid:19) 

1

2(p + 2)!

f 2

p+2)

(5)

where h3(= db) is the three form eld strength of the antisymmetric tensor bm n
and fp+2(= dap+1) denotes the (p + 2)-form eld-strength of the (p + 1)-form r-r
potential ap+1.

in solving the classical equations of sd with respect to gm n ,  and ap+1, several
ansatzs are adopted. the d-dimensional coordinates xm are denoted by separating
them into the tangential (x) and the transverse part (ym) to the d-p-brane as
xm = (x, ym), where  = 0  p and m = p + 1  d  1. then take the following
ansatzs
(6)

ds2 = e2adxdx + e2bmndymdyn ,
ap+1 = ecdx0  dx1      dxp ,

(7)
where a, b, c and  are the functions of y only, here y = mnymyn. the last
statement means that the solutions are assumed to be invariant under pp+1so(d
p 1) transformation. then a, b, c and  are all expressed by a common function,
h(y), which is determined by the eld equations derived by sd. the nal result is
obtained as follows:

where

e2a(y) = h(y)1/2,

e2b(y) = h(y)1/2 ,

ec(y) = h(y)1  1,

e2 = h(y)(3p)/2,

h(y) = 1 + 2qtpg(y) ,

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

g(y) = 


h d|y| d d+1i1
 1
2 log |y|

,

d > 0 ,

d = 0 . 


3 here d is used to denote the target space dimension, but we consider the case of d = 10

throughout this paper

2

and d = d  p  3. here q = 2(q+1)/2/(cid:16)(q + 1)/2(cid:17) denotes the area of a unit

q-dimensional sphere sq.

here bm n = 0 since the d-brane considered above has one kind of the r-r

charge and no ns-ns charge, and we use the form of p = 3 in the following.

3 solutions of d-brane action

here we discuss on the classical solutions of sp+1 in the background d-brane(s) which
is set parallel to the test brane considering now. the classical equations of sp+1 are
solved for p = 3 by adopting the static gauge for the dieomorphism invariance,
for which the world-volume coordinates  are equated with the p + 1 spacetime
coordinates as

x m = ,

(12)
the remaining coordinates, x m, are treated as scalar elds in the brane world-
volume, but we retain only one coordinate among them as a eld which is responsible
for the congurations of the brane and it is denoted here by x(). this coordinate
is taken in the direction perpendicular to the other brane.

m = 0, 1, . . . , p.

then we can write sp+1 with p = 3 as follows,

s4 = t3z d4(cid:18) 1

h

(d  1)(cid:19)

(13)

where the eld-independent constant is subtracted from the above lagrangian density
for the brevity, and

d = (1  h ~e2)(1 + h(x)2) + h 2( ~e  x)2  h x 2 + 2h 2 ~e  ( ~b  x) x

+ h ~b2(1  h x 2) + h 2( ~b  x)2  h 2( ~b  ~e)2,

(14)

(15)

h = 1 + 2qt3g(xm  x) ,

where xm denotes the distance between two branes. the u(1) gauge elds are
denoted by the conventional, electromagnetic elds ~e and ~b.

3.1 solutions in the at background

firstly, we solve the equations for h = 1: the case of the innite distance between
the two branes. the solutions are restricted to the static one. in this case, d is
written as,

d = (1  ~e2)(1 + (x)2) + ( ~e  x)2 + ~b2 + ( ~b  x)2  ( ~b  ~e)2,

and the following equations are obtained,

  {[(1  ~e2)x + ( ~e  x) ~e + ( ~b  x) ~b]/d} = 0,
  {[(1 + (x)2) ~e  ( ~e  x)x + ( ~b  ~e) ~b]/d} = 0,
  {[ ~b + ( ~b  x)x  ( ~b  ~e) ~e)]/d} = 0.

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

3

since we are interested in isotropic solutions, we take the following ansatz:

~e = f (r)r ,

~b = g(r)r , x = x (r)r ,

(20)

where r represents the unit vector in the radial direction, and a prime denotes a
dierentiation with respect to r. then, eqs. (17) and (18) are expressed as

  {x s 1 + g2
  {fs 1 + g2

1  f 2 + x 2 r} = 0,
1  f 2 + x 2 r} = 0.

from eqs. (21) and (22), the function f is proportional to x 

f = x ,

(21)

(22)

(23)

where  is a constant. since the ansatz (20) satises automatically eq. (19) for
any g, we cannot determine the function g since the number of the independent
equations is reduced to two. so we need further ansatz or assumption to obtain the
solution. we now assume that the magnetic eld ~b is given by some appropriate
form as an arbitrary external eld, then we can solve the equation eq. (21) or (22)
as follows,

,

(24)

x(r) = z 

r

dr

a

q(1 + g2)r4  r4

0

where a denotes an integral constant and r4
0 = (1  2)a2. here we consider the
purely electric (g = 0) case, namely without the external magnetic eld, then the
solution (24) reduces to the bps state for  = 1 and to the non-bps solution given
in ref.[1] for  6= 1.

next, consider the case adding one more ansatz to eq. (20) as follows:

(25)
where (6= 0) is a constant. in this case, the string is considered as the source of
both the electric and the magnetic charges, so we call this type as the dyonic string.
the equation is solved as

g = x ,

x(r) = z 

r

dr(cid:20){1  (1  2) a2

r4 } +q(1  (1  2) a2

22

r4 )2 + 42 a2

r4

for 2 + 2 = 1, this solution reduces to the bps dyonic solution,

x(r) =

a
r

.

(cid:21)1/2

.

(26)

(27)

in this case, the bogomolnyi equations are satised by the saturation of the bound

e  ( ~e  ~x) + ( ~b  ~x).

(28)

the solutions obtained here are classied in the parameter space  and  as shown
in fig. 1.

there are many number of non-bps dyonic string solutions, and some typical

one are shown in the fig.2 along the line in the parameter space shown in fig.1.

3.2 solutions in the background d-brane(s)
here we consider the solutions for the case of h 6= 1. in this case, the wess-zumino
(13) cannot be neglected as in the previous
term in the action s4 given in eq.
section. to see its important meaning, we notice that s4 vanishes for ~e = ~b = 0.
this is a result of the cancellation between the bi and the wz terms, and it reects
that there is no force between two parallel branes [13]. we therefore expect that the
wz term would play an important role in solving the equations for h 6= 1.
here we solve the equations of motion of s4 in the background conguration of the
parallel d3-brane(s), so the force is absent for the trivial solution of ~e = ~b = 0. but
it is expected that the non-trivial solutions, which are obtained in the background
of at space-time by solving the bi-action, would be aected by the background
conguration. the surviving solutions should be deformed and restricted.

the equations are written as follows:

h
x

f1 +   ~f2 = 0 ,

1

 

d (cid:16)(1 + h(x)2) ~e + h[( ~b  ~e) ~b  ( ~e  x)x](cid:17) = 0 ,
 

d (cid:16)( ~b + h[( ~b  x)x  ( ~b  ~e) ~e](cid:17) = 0 ,

1

where h

x = 4 q/(xm  x)5 and

f1 =

1

h 2 (d  1) +

1

2hd  ~e2(1 + h(x)2)  (x)2(1  h ~e2)

 2h[( ~b  x)2 + ( ~e  x)2  ( ~b  ~e)2]  ~b2!,

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

1

f2 =

d (cid:16)(1  h ~e2)x + h[( ~e  x) ~e + ( ~b  x) ~b](cid:17) .

(29)  (31) are respectively reduced to eqs.

here the time-dependence of the elds are neglected since the solutions are restricted
to the static one. obviously the eect of the background conguration appears
through h, and eqs.
(17)  (19)
for h = 1. the most characteristic feature is seen in the rst term of the l.h.s.
of eq. (29). and the wz term is also included in f1 of this term. for q = 0,
this term disappears, and the second term reduces to eq. (17) given in the at
background. the rst term therefore represents a newly appeared constraint due
to the non-trivial background conguration. due to this term, the above equations
can be solved with ansatzs (20) and (23) only since the new constraint determines
the magnetic eld g(r) as seen below.

we solve the above equations by taking the ansatz (20) used in the previous

subsection. then the above equations are rewritten as follows:

h
x

f1 +    x 
d

(1 + hg2)r! = 0 ,

(34)

6

(1 + hg2)r! = 0 ,

   f
d
(1 + h(x 2  f 2))r! = 0 ,

   f
d

where

f1 =

1

2h 2d (cid:16)2(d 

d) + h(f 2  x 2  g2) + 2h 2g2(f 2  x 2)(cid:17) ,
d = (1 + hg2)(1 + h(x 2  f 2)) .

(35)

(36)

(37)

(38)

with the same way as in the previous subsection, the number of equations is reduced
to two since eq. (36) is satised by any functional form of f , g and x.

then we need one more ansatz which gives one relation among these three func-
tions. to nd similar solutions to the one obtained in the previous subsection, we
take the following ansatz

f = x  .

(39)

it should be noticed that this was not an ansatz but a solution of the equations in
the previous subsection. under this ansatz, eq. (35) is solved as

f
d

(1 + hg2) =

a2
r2 ,

where a2 is an integral constant. the eq. (34) is rewritten as

f1 = 0 ,

(40)

(41)

since the second term of this equation vanishes, i.e. f2 = 0. we notice that the
above equation (41) does not appear in the case of the at background. as a result,
the magnetic eld g(r) can not be determined. in the present case, we can obtain
the following solution due to eq. (41),

x =

a2
r

, f = 

a2
r2 , g = 

1  2 a2
r2 .

(42)

this solution represents the dyonic string with both electric and magnetic charges,
and the bps bound is saturated by this solution since it is represented as

~e = cos()x ,

~b = sin()x ,

(43)

by the parametrization cos  = ( 1). here, we notice the following points: (i)
the ansatz (39), which yields a non-bps solution in the case of the at background,
leads to the bps solution due to the eq. (41). (ii) the form of the bps solution
obtained is independent on the parameter of the background since it is not deformed
by the background congurations. (iii) the eect of the background conguration
appears indirectly through the induced world-volume metric in the brane action.
namely, r has a minimum value, r0 = a2/xm [9], where the solution touches the
opposite brane(s) since x(r0) = xm. at this point, the proper distance in the
world-volume of the brane becomes innite since the induced metric diverges. then

7

we arrive at the conguration of the dyonic string which connects two branes with
a nite distance.

from the fact (iii), the energy of the string part is obtained as a nite value by

integrating the energy density of the system in the range r0 < r <  as follows,

e = 4a2t3xm ,

(44)

which represent the energy of the string of the length xm with the tension of 4a2t3.
it is expected that this object with a nite energy would appear as a dyon in the
yang-mills theory.

4 non-bps solutions

we now turn to the non-bps solutions. as seen in the subsection 4.1, the non-
bps solutions obtained in the at space are separated into two groups from their
property. one is the pure electric string which connects to the anti-brane to form
a bound state. the second is the dyonic string which could arrive at the other
brane(s) at the innite distance. in the case of the nite distance also, these two
types of solutions can be found by taking other ansatz than the one given in the
previous section, (39).

4.1 pure electronic case

first we consider the case of the pure electric solution. this is obtained by taking
the following ansatz,

g = 0.

(45)

in this case, we can obtain the following equation for x from eqs. (34) and (40),

where

x  +

2
r

x  

x 
2

(ln d) =

2 q(d  1)2

x 5h 2

,

d =

1 + hx 2

1 + h(a2/r2)2 .

(46)

(47)

it is easily seen that eq. (46) is reduced to the equation of the at background in
the limit of q = 0 (h = 1). in fact, we obtain the following solution for q = 0,

x  =

c1/r2

q1  c2/r4

,

(48)

where c1 and c2 are constants depending on the boundary conditions. this is equiv-
alent to the solution (24).

while eq. (46) for h 6= 1 is highly nonlinear, so it is dicult to solve it analyt-

ically. then we give the solutions numerically.

0.00898 for the rst type, and (e) x (10) = 0.0101, (f) 0.011, (g) 0.0115 for the second type.

the resultant solutions are shown in fig. 3, where the bps solution, x = a2/r,
is also shown by the dotted line for the comparison. in the fig.3, two types of non-
bps solutions are seen. they are obtained here by giving the boundary conditions
at an appropriate point (r = rb) as

x(rb) =

a2
rb

, x (rb) = 

a2
r2
b

,

(49)

where  is a parameter. the solutions of the rst group (a)  (d) are obtained for
 < 1, and the second group (e)  (g) are for  > 1. we notice that the bps
solution is obtained for  = 1. in this sense, the bps solution is the critical one
which separates the two types of solutions.

the rst type of solution covers all region of r, and it ends at r = 0 with nite
value of x(0) and negative value of x (0). so the shape of this conguration has a
cusp at r = 0 and the conguration is singular at this point.

the second type of solution is bounded as r  r1, where r1 varies depending on
the boundary conditions and x (r1) = . due to this property, the solution can
be connected to the other half with the opposite orientation [1] to make the bound
state of brane and anti-brane.

these solutions have the same qualitative properties with the one obtained in
the at background. however they are aected by the non-trivial background in the
present case. the most prominent inuence is seen in the fact that these solutions
could not reach at the position of the other brane(s), x = xm. this is understood
as follows. from eqs. (38) and (40), we obtain

f 2 =

h 1 + x 2

h 1(r2/a2)2 + 1

.

9

(50)

then we nd the relation f = x  at x = xm, where h 1 = 0, and we obtain
the bps solution from this condition. this implies that only the bps solution can
arrive at x = xm. so there is no non-bps electric string state, which connect two
parallel branes with a nite energy. such a object is restricted to the bps saturated
strings.

the boundary condition x(10) = 0.1 and x (10) = 0.0101.

as for the q dependence of the solutions, we can see the typical eect from the
solutions as shown in fig. 4, where the second type of solutions for two dierent q
value are given. the q dependence is small, but it can be seen near the end point of
the solution. the larger q becomes the wider the radius of the tube grows, and the
end point of the string conguration goes back. this implies that the bound state
of the brane and anti-brane would be pushed to vanish through the annihilation of
them near the branes.

4.2 dyonic case

next, we consider the dyonic non-bps string congurations under the d-brane
background. the equation for this solution is obtained by taking the ansatz (25),
g = x , which is given in the section 3.1 to obtain the dyonic solution in the at
background. in the present case, eq. (23) is not used dierently from the the case
of section 3.1. in terms of this ansatz (25) and eq. (40), which is the solution of
(35), we obtain

f 2 =

1 + hx 2

1 + h[2x 2 + (a2/r2)2]

(

a2
r2 )2 .

(51)

substituting eq. (51) and (25) into eq. (34), we can solve eq. (34) with respect to
x(r) by rewriting it as the dierential equation of x(r). we solve the dierential
equation numerically.

we rstly discuss the dyonic solutions which are corresponding to the solutions
(g) in fig.3 at the limit of  = 0. namely we take the same boundary conditions

10

with the one of (g) in fig.3 in solving the equation considered here for  6= 0. in
fig.5, the solutions are shown for various values of . the -dependence of the
solutions is seen from the fig.5, and the behaviors are similar to the case of the at
background.

(a)  = 1.0 and (b)  = 1.4 with the boundary condition x(10) = 0.1 and x (10) = 0.0115.

these solutions exceed xm which was the bound for the non-bps solution of
 = 0. this property is also seen in the case of the at background, where this
conguration extends to x =  at r = 0. but the shapes of this congurations are
aected by the d-brane background. this point is dierent from the case of the at
background. this is seen from the results shown in fig.6, in which q-dependence
for the solution is presented. although the q-dependence is small, we can see it

near the neck (0.2 < r < 6) of the throat by extending the scale of x(r). this
q-dependence is the main dierence from the bps solutions which are independent
on the background.

we should notice the following fact. for any solution, the metric of the world-
volume action is determined from the same d-brane background, and it has a sin-
gularity at x = xm. so the conguration should be cut at this point, then we can
say that the conguration obtained here represents the dyonic string which connects
two d-branes with a nite distance. but these solutions are not the bps states, so
some dynamical corrections would modify the congurations obtained here. this
is a dynamical problem, which would be related to the non-supersymmetric yang
mills theory. this point is open here.

finally, we comment on the solutions of  6= 0 which are reduced to the solutions
belonging to the group of (a)  (d) of fig.3 for  = 0. the results are shown in the
fig.7 for various values of . in this case, the qualitative behavior of the solutions
is the same with the one of  = 0. but we should notice that there is no bound in
principle at x = xm.

5 conclusions

we have given the solutions of the world-volume action of a d3-brane which is
placed parallel to the background d3-brane(s). the equations are rstly solved in
the at background, and two kinds of non-bps solutions are shown, i.e. the pure
electric and the dyonic solutions. they smoothly approaches to the bps solutions
in a special limit of the parameters.

both the bps and non-bps solutions are also obtained in the d-brane(s) back-
ground. the bps solutions has the same functional form with the one obtained in
the at background and it can extend to innity. but it should be bounded at the

12

position of the opposite brane(s) since the proper distance in the world-volume of
the brane becomes innite there. as a result, a nite energy of this bps state is
obtained.

on the other hand, both types of non-bps solutions are aected by the d-brane
background. especially the electric-type solutions can not arrive at the opposite
brane(s) since they are pushed back by the background congurations. in this sense,
this type of non-bps solutions can not be considered as strings which connect two
branes. one of these non-bps solutions can be interpreted as the half-part of the
bound state of the brane and anti-brane as in the case of the at background. it
is observed that the distance between the brane and the anti-brane of this bound
state becomes shorter when it nears the background branes.

although the congurations of the dyonic non-bps solutions are also aected by
the d-brane background, they could extend over x = xm and x becomes innite
at r = 0. on the other hand, the induced-metric of the world-volume action of the
d-brane is independent on the solutions, so the congurations of the solutions are
bounded at x = xm as in the case of the bps solutions. then we arrive at the
conclusion that the conguration of non-bps dyonic string connects two d-branes
with a nite distance and with a nite energy. this conguration however receives
a dynamical correction because of no supersymmetry, and this would be related to
the dynamics of the non-supersymmetric yang -mills dynamics.
