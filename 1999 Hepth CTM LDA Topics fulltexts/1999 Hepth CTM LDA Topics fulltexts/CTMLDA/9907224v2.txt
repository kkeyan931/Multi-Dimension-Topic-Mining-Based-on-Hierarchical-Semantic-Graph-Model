abstract

the multidimensional n = 4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics (susy
qm) is constructed using the supereld approach. as a result, the component
form of the classical and quantum lagrangian and hamiltonian is obtained.
in the considered susy qm both classical and quantum n = 4 algebras
include central charges, and this opens various possibilities for partial super-
symmetry breaking. it is shown that quantum mechanical models with one
quarter, one half and three quarters of unbroken(broken) supersymmetries
can exist in the framework of the multidimensional n = 4 susy qm, while
the one-dimensional n = 4 susy qm, constructed earlier, admits only one
half or total supersymmetry breakdown. we illustrate the constructed general
formalism, as well as all possible cases of the partial susy breaking taking as
an example a direct multidimensional generalization of the one-dimensional
n = 4 superconformal quantum mechanical model. some open questions and
possible applications of the constructed multidimensional n = 4 susy qm
to the known exactly integrable systems and problems of quantum cosmology
are briey discussed.

i. introduction

the supersymmetric quantum mechanics (susy qm), being rst introduced in [1] 
[2] for the n = 2 case, turns out to be a convenient tool for investigating problems of
supersymmetric eld theories, since it provides the simple and, at the same time, quite
adequate understanding of various phenomena arising in relativistic theories.

the important question of all modern theories of fundamental interactions, including
superstrings and m  theory, is the problem of spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry.
supersymmetry, as a fundamental symmetry of the nature, if exists, has to be sponta-
neously broken at low energies since particles with all equal quantum numbers, except the
spin, are not observed experimentally. several (rather dierent) mechanisms of spontaneous
breakdown of supersymmetry have been proposed in particle physics in order to resolve this
problem. one of them is to add to the supersymmetric lagrangian the so  called d , or f 
terms which are invariant under supersymmetry transformations but break supersymmetry
spontaneously due to nonzero vacuum expectation values or, alternatively, introduce into
the theory some soft breaking mass terms by hand; the latter procedure does not spoil
the nonrenormalization theorem of the supersymmetric eld theories and was successfully
applied to construct the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (see [3]
and refs. therein). next mechanism of susy breaking is the dynamical (nonperturbative)
breakdown of supersymmetry, caused by instantons (see, for example, [4] and refs. therein).
in this case, the energy of tunneling between topologically distinct vacua produces an energy
shift from the zero level, hence leading to the spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry.
and, nally, the mechanism of partial spontaneous breaking of the n = 2 supersymmetry
in the eld theory was recently proposed in [5]. this mechanism is based on the inclusion
into the lagrangian two types of the fayet  iliopoulos terms  electric and magnetic ones,
and it leads to the corresponding modication of the n = 2 susy algebra [6].

the problem of spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry could be investigated in the
framework of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics as well. the conjecture that super-
symmetry can be spontaneously broken by instantons [1]  [2] was investigated in detail by
several authors for the case of n = 2 susy qm [7]  [9]. however, the most physically
interesting case is provided by the n = 4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics since it can be
applied to the description of the systems resulting from the realistic n = 1 supersymmet-
ric eld theories (including supergravity) in four (d = 4) dimensions after the dimensional
reduction to one dimension (see, for example, [10]).

the one  dimensional n = 4 susy qm was constructed rst in [11]  [13]. partial
breaking of supersymmetry, caused by the presence of the central charges in the correspond-
ing superalgebra, was also discussed in [13]. it was the rst example of partial breaking of
supersymmetry in the framework of susy qm and the corresponding mechanism is in full
analogy with that in [5] in the eld theory. the main point is that the presence of central
charges in the superalgebra allows the partial supersymmetry breakdown, whereas accord-
ing to wittens theorem [1], no partial supersymmetry breakdown is possible if the susy
algebra includes no central charges. the main goal of our paper is further generalization of
the construction, proposed in [13] to the multidimensional case and investigation of partial
breaking of supersymmetry under consideration.

consideration of the supersymmetric algebra with central charges is of particular impor-

2

tance for several reasons. first, it provides a good tool to study dyon solutions of quantum
eld theory since in such theories the mass and electric and magnetic charges turns out to
be the central charges [14]. second, the central charges produce the rich structure of super-
symmetry breaking. namely, it is possible to break part of all supersymmetries retaining
all others exact [15]. in fact, the invariance of a state with respect to the supersymmetry
transformation means saturation of the bogomolny bound, and this situation takes place in
n = 2 and n = 4 supersymmetric yang  mills theory [16]  [17] as well as in the theories
of extended supergravity [18].

the investigation of supersymmetric properties of branes the in m  theory has also
revealed that partial breakdown of supersymmetry takes place. namely, the ordinary branes
break half of the supersymmetries, while intersecting and rotating branes can leave only
1/4, 1/8, 1/16 or 1/32 of the supersymmetries unbroken [19].

the main characteristic features of partial susy breaking in the eld theories with the
extended supersymmetry can be revealed in supersymmetric qm, since in the both cases
partial supersymmetry breakdown is provided by the central charges in the susy algebra.
therefore the detailed study of partial supersymmetry breakdown in supersymmetric quan-
tum mechanics can lead to the deeper understanding of analogous eect in supersymmetric
eld theories.

the known examples of the breakdown of supersymmetries in the supersymmetric quan-
tum mechanics are the cases, where either all supersymmetries are broken(exact) or only
half of them are broken(exact) [13]. in this paper, we demonstrate the possibility of the
three  quarters or one  quarter of the supersymmetry breakdown in the framework of the
multidimensional n = 4 susy qm. the later case (3/4 of the supersymmetries are exact)
has not been observed before in susy qm ( in the specic n = 4 supergravity model it
was observed in [20]) and seems to be quite interesting by itself even without specifying the
physical origin of the phenomenon.

in sec.

the paper is organized as follows.

ii, we present a formal construction of
the n = 4 multidimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics: classical and quantum
hamiltonian and lagrangian, susy transformations, algebra of supercharges and so on. in
sec. iii, partial supersymmetry breaking is investigated and all possible cases of the partial
susy breakdown are listed. in sec. iv, we give an exactly solvable example which illus-
trates main properties of the introduced formal constructions. this example is interesting
by itself since we consider the multidimensional generalization of the n = 4 superconformal
quantum mechanics [13], [21] which is naturally related to the extremal rn black holes in
near horizon limit and ads/cft correspondence [22]. in sec. v, we conclude with some
open questions and further perspectives.

ii. d  dimensional n = 4 susy quantum mechanics

in this section, we describe a general formalism of the d  dimensional (d  1) n = 4
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, starting with the supereld approach and concluding
with the component form of the desired lagrangian and hamiltonian.

are complex conjugate to each other as well.1 the generators of the above supersymmetry

along with the time translation operator h = i 
relations:

t obey the following (anti)commutation

[h, qa] = [h, qa] = 0.

(2.3)

the automorphism group for a given algebra is so(4) = su(2)  su(2) and the generators
of the n = 4 susy transformations are in the spinor representation of one of the su(2)
groups.

the next step is to construct irreducible representations of the algebra (2.3). the usual

way of doing this is to use the supercovariant derivatives

(2.4)

and impose some constraints on the general supereld. hereafter we deal with the supereld
i (i = 1, ..., d) subjected to the following constraints:

[da, da]i = 4mi,
dadai = 2ni,
da dai = 2ni,

(2.5)

where mi are real constants, while ni and ni are mutually complex  conjugated constants.
such constraints for the case of the one  dimensional n =4 susy qm were considered rst
in [13] as a minimal consistent generalization of the analogous constraints of [11] and [21]
with vanishing right hand side. the presence of the additional arbitrary parameters leads,
as we shall see below to the considerably richer structure of the theory. the explicit form
of the supereld i is the following:

1our conventions for spinors are as follows: a = bba, a = abb, a = bba, a = ab b, a =
(a), a = (a), ()  aa = 212, ( )  a a = (), 12 = 1, 12 = 1.

(   t). note that in the case when all the constants mi, ni and ni are equal to zero,
the supereld (2.6) represents d trivial copies of the supereld , given in [11], which
describes the irreducible representation of the one-dimensional n = 4 susy qm. the latter
supereld contains one bosonic eld , four fermionic elds a and a, and three auxiliary
bosonic elds bb

a (i = 1, 2, 3) are ordinary pauli matrices.

abi where (i)b

a = (i)b

another irreducible representation of the algebra (2.3) can be constructed after making

the appropriate generalization of the constraints given in [12]:

(acdc db + bcdc da) = 0.

(2.7)

the technique of constructing n = 4 susy invariant lagrangians is absolutely the same
for both the cases and, therefore, we shall not consider the second one separately.

the components of the supereld (2.6) transform under the n = 4 transformations as

follows:

now one can write down the most general form of the lagrangian which is invariant

under the above-mentioned n = 4 susy transformations

(2.9)

where a(i) is an arbitrary function of the supereld i called the superpotential. the
second term is the fayet  iliopoulos term and a
i are just constants. the
expression for the lagrangian (2.9) is the most general one in the sense that any other
n = 4 susy invariant terms added will lead with necessity to higher derivatives in the
component form.

(2.21)

(2.22)

these formulae for the conserved supercharges complete the classical description of the
desired n = 4 susy multidimensional mechanics, and now to quantize it we should analyze
its constraints.

following the standard procedure of quantization of the system with bosonic and

fermionic degrees of freedom [23], we introduce the canonical poisson brackets

{i, pj} = i
j,

{ai, p(),bj} = a

b i
j,

{ i

a, pb

( ),j} = a

b i
j,

(2.23)

where pi, p(),ai, and pa
form of the momenta

( ),i are the momenta conjugated to i, ai and i

a. from the explicit

pi = gij i,

p(),ai = igij j
a,

pa
( ),i = igijaj,

(2.24)

(2.25)

with the metric gij given by (2.16), one can conclude that the system possesses the second
 class fermionic constraints

7

(),ai = p(),ai + igij j
a,

since

and a

( ),i = pa

( ),i + igijaj,

{a

( ),i, (),bj} = 2igija
b .

(2.26)

(2.27)

therefore, the quantization has to be done using the dirac brackets dened for any two
functions va and vb as

{va, vb}dirac = {va, vb}  {va, c}

1

{c, d}

{d, vb}.

(2.28)

as a result, we obtain the following dirac brackets for the canonical variables:

tonian hquant. is a hermitean self  adjoint operator as well.

as a result, equations (2.34)  (2.40) completely describe the general formalism of the
n = 4 susy d  dimensional quantum mechanics, and this provides the basis for the anal-
ysis of its main properties.

iii. partial susy breaking

let us investigate in detail the question of partial supersymmetry breakdown in the
framework of the constructed n = 4 susy qm in an arbitrary d number of dimensions.
as it has been mentioned in the introduction, the problem of partially broken supersymmetry
is very important for applications in supergravity, superstring theories and in the m  theory
as well, and the supersymmetric quantum mechanics turns out to be an adequate mighty
tool for investigating of the corresponding problems in supersymmetric eld theories.

we shall see that in contrast with the one  dimensional n = 4 susy qm, the multidi-
mensional one provides also possibilities when either only one quarter of all supersymmetries
is exact (for d  2), or one quarter of all supersymmetries is broken (for d  3).

in order to study partial susy breaking it is convenient to introduce a new set of real

 valued supercharges

sa = qa + qa,

t a = i(qa  qa).

(3.1)

(3.2)

in the above equations the su(2) covariance is obviously damaged. this is the price we pay
for passing to the realvalued supercharges. however, for a further discussion the loss of the
covariance does not cause any problems. the label a has now to be considered just as the
number of supercharges denoted by s and t .

the new supercharges form the following n = 4 superalgebra with the central charges

{sa, sb} = h(a
{t a, t b} = h(a
{sa, t b} = i(a

b + b
b + b

i ni),

i ni),
i ni),

(3.3)
(3.4)
(3.5)

where a

bi = (i )a

b i

i and i

i are real parameters.

the algebra (3.3)  (3.5) is still nondiagonal. however, some particular choices of the
constant parameters mi, ni and i
i bring the algebra to the standard form, i.e., to the form
when the right  hand side of (3.5) vanishes and the right  hand sides of (3.3) and (3.4)
are diagonal with respect to the indices a and b.

now we consider several cases separately.

a. four supersymmetries exact / four supersymmetries broken

if we put equal to zero all central charges, appearing in the algebra, then no partial
breakdown of supersymmetry is possible.
in this case, all supersymmetries are exact, if
the energy of the ground state is zero; otherwise all of them are broken. this statement is
obviously independent of the number of dimensions d.

10

b. two supersymmetries exact

the case of partial supersymmetry breakdown, when the half of supersymmetries are
exact, have been considered earlier [13] in the framework of one-dimensional n = 4 susy
qm, but we shall describe it for completeness as well. consider the one  dimensional
(d = 1) n = 4 susy qm and put all the constants entering into the right  hand sides of
(3.3)  (3.5) equal to zero, except

then, the algebra (3.3)  (3.5) takes the form

m1

and 3
1.

{s1, s1} = 2h + 2m13
1,
{s2, s2} = 2h  2m13
1,
{t 1, t 1} = 2h + 2m13
1,
{t 2, t 2} = 2h  2m13
1.

(3.6)

(3.7)

it means that if the energy of the ground state is equal to m13
1 and the last-mentioned
product is positive, then s2 and t 2 supersymmetries are exact, while the other two are
1 is negative, then s1 and t 1 supersymmetries are exact provided the energy
broken. if m13
of the ground state is equal to m13
1.

c. one supersymmetry exact

the case of the three  quarters breakdown of supersymmetry is possible if the dimension
of n = 4 susy qm is at least two (d  2). indeed, for d = 2 let us keep the following set
of parameters nonvanished:

3

1, 1

2, m1

and re(n2)  n 2.

(3.8)

then, one obtains

further choice

{s1, s1} = 2h + 2m13
{s2, s2} = 2h  2m13
{t 1, t 1} = 2h + 2m13
{t 2, t 2} = 2h  2m13

then t 2 supersymmetry is broken, while all others are exact under the condition that the

1. if the last-mentioned product is positive, then
t 2 supersymmetry is exact, while all others are broken provided that the energy of the
ground state is 3m13
1 and we arrive at the three-dimensional generalization of the case c.
obviously, when considering the three  dimensional n = 4 susy qm, one can either
keep the parameters (3.8) under the condition (3.10), or the parameters (3.6), or put all of
them equal to zero and, therefore, obtain all particular cases of spontaneous breakdown of
supersymmetry discussed earlier. it is also obvious that all these cases can be obtained from
the higher dimensional (d  3) n = 4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

to summarize this section one should note that according to the given general analysis
of partial susy breaking in the n = 4 multidimensional susy qm, there exist possibilities
of constructing the models with 1
4 supersymmetries unbroken, as well as models
with totally broken or totally unbroken supersymmetries. however, the answer to the ques-
tion which of these possibilities can be realized for the considered system, crucially depends
on the form of the chosen superpotential and on the imposed boundary conditions of the
quantum mechanical problem.

iv. explicit example

for better illustration of the ideas of the previous section it is useful to consider a
particular choice of the superpotential a(i). as it has been mentioned before, to consider
all possible cases of partial supersymmetry breakdown, the minimal amount of the superelds
needed is three. therefore, let us take three superelds of the type (2.6) and choose the
constants mi, ni, ni and i

i in accordance with expressions (3.6), (3.8) and (3.11).

a simple and at the same time interesting example is the case when the superpotential
is the direct sum of terms, each being a function of only one supereld. this gives the
possibility of the considerable simplication of the classical and quantum hamiltonians, and
the supercharges as well [13]. we choose the explicit form of the superpotential as

a(i) = ilni,

i = 1, 2, 3

(4.1)

and consider the physical bosonic components of the superelds i as functions of the new
variables xi, namely,

making the following redenition of the fermionic variables

2
i = (xi)

.

ai = aivuut2

2a
(i)2 ,

i
a = i

avuut2

2a
(i)2 ,

(4.2)

(4.3)

where no summation over the repeated indices is assumed, one obtains the canonical com-
mutation relations between fermions

{ai, j

b } = a

b ij.

(4.4)

inserting expressions (4.1), (4.2) and (4.3) into (2.37), one obtains the three  dimensional
superconformal n = 4 quantum mechanics [21] with

hquant. = h 1 + h 2 + h 3,

(4.5)

i.e., as it could be concluded from the fact that the superpotential is diagonal with respect to
the superelds considered, the total hamiltonian is also a direct sum of three hamiltonians,
each of them containing the bosonic and fermionic operators of only one type. the explicit
form of the hamiltonians h i, (i = 1, 2, 3.) is

(4.8)

the next step is to nd the energy spectrum of the quantum hamiltonian (4.5).

since the bosonic and fermionic variables of each type are completely separated, the
eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian (4.5) is a direct product of the eigenfunctions of the
hamiltonians (4.6) - (4.8) and the total energy is just a sum of the energies corresponding
to the hamiltonians h i.

let us nd the energy spectrum of the hamiltonian h 1. consider the general state in
the reduced fock space spanned by the fermionic creation and annihilation operators 1
and a1 obeying the anticommutation relations (4.4) with i = 1:

a

|i = x1(x1)|0i + y a

1 (x1) 1

a|0i + z1(x1) 1

a

a1|0i.

(4.9)

the operator h 1, acting on the state vector (4.9), gives the following four shrodinger equa-
tions for the unknown functions x1(x1), y a

have been investigated in detail for the nonsupersymmetric theory [24]  [25] and in the
framework of the n = 2 supersymmetric quantum mechanics [25]  [28] as well. the most
detailed and complete study has been done by das and pernice [25] where the eigenfunc-
tions and energy spectrum of the hamiltonian of the type (4.14) were found after appropriate
regularization of the potential and superpotential, depending on whether one considers non-
supersymmetric or n = 2 supersymmetric problem. however, as it can be seen from (4.1)
and (4.2) the superpotential in our n = 4 case for the hamiltonian with the 1
x2 term in the
potential energy is regular in contrast with the case of n = 2 supersymmetric quantum me-
chanics and, therefore, we use the results of [25] which are obtained after the regularization
of the potential, but not of the superpotental.

a is not diagonal. an analogous situation takes place for the hamiltonian

now we are in a position to describe partial supersymmetry breaking following the lines

of the previous section.

first, let us consider the one  dimensional case with m1 equal to zero. as it has
been mentioned above, zero value of m1 is the branching point and, therefore, the energy
spectra (4.16) and (4.17) as well as the wavefunctions in these regions completely coincide.
therefore, one has the couple of supersymmetric ground states 1
iii and all supersymmetries
are exact.

as it has been mentioned in the previous section, in order to describe the halfbreaking of
supersymmetry it is enough to consider only the spectrum of the hamiltonian h 1. inserting
the corresponding eigenvalues of the operator h 1 for each range of the parameter m1 into
equations (3.7), one obtains that half of supersymmetries are always broken.

considering the spectra of the hamiltonians h 1 and h 2, one can obtain the three 
indeed, from equations (3.9), (3.10) and (4.15) 
quarter breakdown of supersymmetry.
(4.18), one can conclude that either t 1 or t 2 supersymmetries are exact depending on the
range of the parameter m1. the corresponding ground state wavefunctions obviously are

(4.21)

(4.22)

in order to study the possibility of the one  quarter breakdown of supersymmetry, one
has to consider the three  dimensional case, i.e., the spectra and the wavefunctions of the
hamiltonians h 1, h 2 and h 3. using equations (3.12), (3.13)  (3.15) and (4.15)  (4.18) one
can conclude that for the considered model the one  quarter supersymmetry breakdown is
impossible since the energy of the ground state equals 3m1 rather than m1, as it is required
for the annihilation of the ground state by the operators s1, s2 and t 1. this obviously does
not mean that one-quarter supersymmetry breakdown is impossible in principle; it means
instead that this eect is impossible for the simple model we considered.

indeed, let us consider the same three  dimensional problem, but restricting ourselves

to non  negative values of coordinate x1, i.e., x1  0.

16

the spectrum of h (4.14), when x belongs to the non  negative half-axis is slightly
dierent [24]2 and it opens a possibility of constructing the ground state which is invariant
under three unbroken supersymmetries. according to [24], we have

where  is given by

e()

k

= 2k   + 1,

1
2q1 + 8g,

(4.23)

(4.24)

and k is the non  negative integer. if   1, then the energies e()
k must be excluded from
the spectrum since the corresponding wave functions are no longer normalizable. otherwise
one has to consider both sets of solutions. applying these results to the problem under
consideration, and putting again 3

3 = 1, one obtains for h 1

2 = 2

1 = 1
1
i = |4m1 + 1|,
1
ii = |4m1|,
iii = |4m1|,
1
1
iv = |4m1  1|.

(4.25)

and, therefore, the energy spectra have the form

ii = 2k1
iii = 2k1

ii  |4m1| + 2,
iii  |4m1|,
iv  |4m1  1| + 1,

(4.26)
both the signs before the second terms have to be taken for ei if  1
2 < m1 < 0 ; for eii
and for eiii if  1

of the parameter so that it belongs to the open interval  1
4 < m1 < 0. then due to the
equations (3.13)  (3.15), (4.16)  (4.17), and (4.26) the minimal energy of the system with

4 < m1 < 1

iii + e2,

iii + e3,

iii = m1,

(4.27)

and according to (3.12) we have the supersymmetric ground states with three supersymme-
tries being unbroken.

in this section we have considered quite schematically the one-, two- and three-
dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric versions of the quantum oscillator with the additional
1
x2 term in the potential energy. however, we believe that even this simple analysis gives a
good illustration of all possible cases of the partial supersymmetry breakdown in the multi-
dimensional n = 4 susy qm. one should also stress the crucial meaning of the boundary
conditions in the question of partial supersymmetry breakdown, as it has been shown for
the case of one  quarter supersymmetry breakdown in the considered example.

2in fact, as it has been recently shown by a. das and s. pernice [25], the energy spectrum,
obtained in [24] is correct if one considers the problem only on the half-axis.

17

v. discussion

in this paper, we have described the general formalism of the multidimensional n = 4 su-
persymmetric quantum mechanics and studied various possibilities of partial supersymmetry
breaking illustrating them by the exactly solvable example.

however, several questions, which seem to be of particular importance are left still
opened.
indeed, it would be interesting to investigate other possibilities of changing the
bosonic end fermionic variables, namely, for the cases, when in contrast with (4.1) and (4.2)
the superpotential a(i) is not a direct sum of the terms, each containing only one super-
eld i and when the bosonic components of these superelds depend on several variables
xi. the detailed study of this problem can lead to possible n = 4 supersymmetrization and
quantization of various pure bosonic integrable systems such as n -particle calogero and
calogero  moser models, which are related to the rn black hole quantum mechanics and
to d = 2 sym theory [29]. this approach can also answer the question about the general
class of potentials which lead to superconformal n = 4 theories in higher dimensions.

another topic, which is left uncovered in this paper, is the possible application of the
constructed multidimensional n = 4 susy qm to the problems of quantum cosmology.
possible embedding of pure bosonic eective lagrangians, derived from the homogeneous
cosmological models to n = 4 susy qm can shed a new light on the old problems of bound-
ary conditions and spontaneous susy breaking in quantum cosmology which have recently
been investigated in the framework of n = 2 supersymmetric sigma  model approach [30]
 [31].

all these questions are now under intensive study and will be reported elsewhere.
