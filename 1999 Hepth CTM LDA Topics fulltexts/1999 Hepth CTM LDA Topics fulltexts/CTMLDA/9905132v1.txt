using supereld dysonschwinger equations, we compute the infrared
dynamics of the semiamputated full vertex, corresponding to the eective
running gauge coupling, in n avour n = 1 supersymmetric qed3.
it is
shown that the presence of a supersymmetrypreserving mass for the matter
multiplet stabilizes the infrared gauge coupling against oscillations present
in the massless case, and we therefore infer that the massive vacuum is thus
selected at the level of the (quantum) eective action. we further demonstrate
that such a mass can indeed be generated dynamically in a selfconsistent
way by appealing to the supereld dysonschwinger gap equation for the full
matter propagator.

i. introduction.

three dimensional u(1) gauge eld theories, whether as toy models of four dimensional
physics or as interesting physical theories in their own right, have attracted considerable
attention [18]. in particular, they have been shown to exhibit a rich and nontrivial infrared
structure, exhibiting dynamical mass generation and critical behaviour; the study of these
phenomena requires nonperturbative techniques. the question of how the incorporation of
supersymmetry aects the infrared physics of these theories has also been addressed [1,9,10]
and it has been found that when n = 1 mass can be generated dynamically without breaking
the supersymmetry, while mass generation in the n = 2 model is forbidden. for the n = 1
model an important question remains unanswered: whether the massive or massless solutions
are selected by the theory. in nonsupersymmetric theories this question can be addressed
by appealing to the eective potential and energetic favourability [1, 2]; in supersymmetric
theories the eective potential vanishes and this argument fails. it has been suggested [1]

1

that the issue can be resolved in supersymmetric theories at the level of the (quantum)
eective action (which does not vanish) and the ward identities arising from supersymmetry.
the ward identities have been found to play a crucial role in this selection in models
which have additional constraints [11, 12], but do not yield any extra information for the
unconstrained u(1) gauge eld theory [10]. in this paper we propose a resolution of this
problem for the basic navour n = 1 u(1) theory at the level of the eective action: by
considering an appropriate set of dysonschwinger equations we show that a mass can be
selfconsistently generated without breaking supersymmetry, and that this mass stabilizes
the infrared eective gauge coupling which in the massless case oscillates without denite
sign.

we adopt a supereld formalism throughout this paper, and work with a large number
n of matter avours. we consider the supereld dysonschwinger equation for the semi
amputated full threepoint vertex [1315] which corresponds to the eective (running) gauge
coupling [16], and compute the infrared dynamics of this vertex in the presence of vanishing
and nonvanishing masses for the matter multiplet. in the massless case the dynamics are
described by a nonlinear dierential equation of emdenfowler type [17,18], which admits
only oscillatory solutions in the infrared; we interpret this as indicating instabilities in the
(quantum) eective action. repeating the computation with the insertion (by hand) of
a nite mass for the matter multiplet we nd that these instabilities disappear, and the
solution shows the existence of a nontrivial infrared xed point for the running coupling.
we then demonstrate that a mass for the matter supereld can be dynamically generated
in a selfconsistent way in this approach by appealing to the dysonschwinger equation for
the full matter propagator cast in terms of the semiamputated full vertex. in agreement
with reference [10] we nd no evidence for a critical avour number, above which dynamical
mass generation does not occur.

in reference [10] the gap equation for the full matter propagator was studied incorpo-
rating a full vertex which by construction satised the u(1) ward identity; instead, in this
work, the form of the full vertex in the deep infrared will be determined selfconsistently
from the dysonschwinger equation. the truncated form of the dysonschwinger equation
is not manifestly gauge invariant, i.e.
it does not respect the ward identity for general
incoming momenta and there is a residual explicit dependence on the covariant gauge xing
parameter. however in the physical, onshell limit of vanishing incoming momenta we nd
that the ward identity is satised and that the dependence on the gauge xing parameter
drops out. since in the present work we are interested only in obtaining and analysing the
structure of the vertex in the deep infrared, the lack of gauge invariance away from vanishing
incoming momentum will not adversely aect our conclusions. the supereld formalism we
adopt keeps supersymmetry manifest and thereby radically simplies the system of equa-
tions one would obtain for the full vertices in a component computation. the disadvantages
of the supereld formalism [19,20] lie in the propagation of gauge artifacts in the connexion
supereld which result in spurious infrared divergences. by working in a general (covariant)
gauge we will have enough exibility to remove these divergences by an appropriate gauge
choice.

this paper is organized as follows: in section ii we construct the action functional for
n = 1 supersymmetric qed3 in supereld formalism and give the form of the dressed prop-
agators for the matter and connexion superelds. in section iii we introduce the supereld

2

semiamputated vertex and construct its dysonschwinger equation; we then solve the
dysonschwinger equation in the presence of vanishing and nonvanishing masses for the
matter supereld and interpret the results. in section iv we discuss the infrared proper-
ties of the matter and connexion supereld propagators, in association with approximations
made in section iii; we show in section v that when the previously computed vertex is in-
corporated in the gap equation for the matter propagator, a mass is dynamically generated
selfconsistently. finally we present our conclusions in section vi.

ii. the action.

we consider a model with n = 1 supersymmetry, n matter avours and local u(1)
gauge invariance. the required action functional then comprises three parts: the gauge
invariant classical eld strength term for the (spinor) connexion , a (lorentz) gauge xing
term, and a locally u(1) invariant kinetic term for the matter superelds  and :

we have included in the matter part an implicit sum over n avours, which do not interact
with each other directly, but interact with the same connexion supereld. the u(1) covariant
derivative  is given by

 .

= d  ie,

where e is the (dimensionful) gauge coupling. we work within largen, in which the quantity

is kept xed (but large) as n becomes large. from the action (2.1) it is easy to derive the
dressed propagators for the matter and connexion superelds:

(2.3)

the matter supereld contains a possible dynamically generated mass function m(p) and the
scalar functions a and b parameterize the dressing of the matter and connexion superelds
respectively. the unknown functions a, b, and m can at least in principle be determined
from the appropriate dysonschwinger equations; we return to these in sections iv and v.
the dressed threepoint vertex derived from the action above is shown in gure 1.

in the next section we construct and analyse the truncated dysonschwinger equation
for the full threepoint vertex shown in gure 1 with and without a mass for the matter
multiplet and demonstrate that oscillations present in the massless case disappear when a
mass for the matter multiplet is included.

iii. dysonschwinger equation for the vertex.

throughout this paper we use a truncation to leading order in 1/n; the truncated

dysonschwinger equation for the full vertex is shown schematically in gure 2.

(cid:16)

g(p, p  q, q)(cid:17)z d2 (p, )(p  q, ) d(q)(q, ),

(3.1)

where we have assumed that we can perform the factorization into a scalar function g
multiplying the superspace structure shown above; the rst graph on the right of gure 2
is of the same form but with g 7 1. this factorization is similar in eect to the approach
taken in nonsupersymmetric qed3 in which the vertex is assumed to be a scalar function
multiplying the usual dirac matrix. this approximation is computationally convenient,
but does not satisfy the ward identity except at vanishing incoming momentum, where
the full vertex becomes onshell. given this limitation we will only be interested in the
behaviour of the theory in this regime; as we will show, even with this restriction we can
obtain interesting information about the infrared xed point structure. as we will see in
section v, the present approach gives rise to the same qualitative picture as that obtained
in reference [10], namely that a mass can be generated dynamically for the matter multiplet
without breaking supersymmetry.

following references [1315] we dene the semiamputated full nonperturbative vertex

g as

g(p1, p2, p3)

.
= z(p1, p2, p3) g(p1, p2, p3),

(3.2)

where z is dened in terms of the functions a and b appearing in the dressed propagators
(2.3) as

z(p1, p2, p3)

.
= a1/2(p1) b1/2(p2) a1/2(p3) > 0.

(3.3)

the quantity e g is the appropriate and natural generalization of the running charge in super
renormalizable gauge eld theories [16]. this denition is the same as the generalization of
the running charge in nonsupersymmetric qed3 [15]. as we will show, this denition also
simplies the structure of the integral equation for the vertex function considerably.

following [15] we consider the external connexion supereld momentum to be vanishingly
small, leaving one external scale p in the problem; computing the superspace part of equa-
tion (3.4) using the identities (2.4) we obtain an integral equation for the full vertex g.
multiplying this equation through by z(p) we obtain the desired integral equation for the
semiamputated vertex g from the dysonschwinger equation in gure 2:

g(p) = z(p) +

(p + k)2 k4

.

(3.6)

we have made the approximation that g3 is the cube of one scalar function dependent on
the scale k only [15]: this is justied by the selfconsistency of our results. note that in the
absence of the inhomogeneous term z on the right hand side of equation (3.6) one obtains
a integral equation involving only g, which can in principle be solved. in the following we
will drop this inhomogeneous term, returning in section iv to a discussion of why this may
be done with safety.

the angular integration is easy to perform, leaving the following equation, which we have

recast in the dimensionless variables x

(3.10)

in the limit w   it has been shown [18] that the only (real and nondivergent) solutions
of this equation are oscillatory. we interpret this as indicating that in the absence of a
mass for the matter multiplet the gauge coupling is subject to instabilities which render it
unphysical. in the next subsection we study the eects of a mass introduced by hand and
show that these instabilities are removed, and that the coupling is driven to an nontrivial
infrared xed point.

b. vertex with nonvanishing mass.

in this subsection we repeat the computation above retaining the eects of a constant
mass m(p)  m(0) = m 6= 0 in the propagators (2.3). here we will put in the mass by
hand, in section v we will show that the semiamputated full vertex we consider admits the
dynamical generation of a mass. the oneloop graph on the right of gure 2 now reads

(3.11)

where as before g3 is given by equation (3.5). again the superspace parts of this equation can
be evaluated using the identities (2.4); in contrast to the case of nonsupersymmetric qed3,
where the inclusion of a mass for the fermions signicantly alters the structure of the integral
equation, here the mass terms only appear in the denominators of the matter propagators,
for the terms linear in m in the numerator cancel. in this respect, a mass for the matter
supereld behaves like a trivial infrared regulator, similar to the eect of a photon mass
in the nonsupersymmetric model [15]. on considering the external connexion momentum
vanishingly small and multiplying through by z(p) as before, the integral equation to be
compared with (3.6) reads

we have again dropped the inhomogeneous term z (see section iv); considering the deep

(3.15)

by the convenient choice of gauge  = 1 this can be reduced to a rst order nonlinear

m(cid:1)  x(cid:1)(cid:3)1/2 ,

(3.16)

where c is an integration constant to be determined from the boundary condition obtained
from the original integral equation. in the limit x  0 the renormalization group  function
vanishes:

lim

2n

g3(x) x3

m2 (x2 + m2)  0,

and hence there is a nontrivial (nindependent) xed point at x = 0 given by

g(0) = c1/2.

(3.17)

(3.18)

returning to the integral equation (3.12) and taking the limit x  0 we can investigate the
constraints on the integration constant c:

g(0) =

1

2n z 

0

dy

g3(y)
y2 + m2 .

(3.19)

since the right hand side of this equation is manifestly positive denite, the trivial solution
g(0) = 1/c = 0 is ruled out, unless g is trivially zero. noting that in the small x limit g
diers from its xed point value by a quantity of order o(x3), we can crudely approximate
the integral in (3.19) as follows

g(0) =

1

2n z m

dy

g3(0)
y2 + m2 +

2n z

y2 + m2 ,

(3.20)

where we have set g in the second integral to its ultraviolet asymptote of unity: both of
these approximations are underestimates, and therefore after performing the integrations we
have

4m g(0) >

1

n (cid:16)1 + g3(0)(cid:17) .

(3.21)

in principle for a given m this leads to a (small) critical coupling, below which there is no
mass generation. note that even on restoring the inhomogeneous term z (see section iv)
the inequality is only modied to

4m(cid:16) g(0)  z(0)(cid:17) >

1

n (cid:16)1 + g3(0)(cid:17) .

(3.22)

8

since at the level of the original integral equation (3.12) in the gauge  = 1 it is obvious
that g > z, we obtain again a (small) critical coupling. note that in the above analysis
there is no evidence for a critical avour number.

to conclude this section we should check our assertion that the value of g at vanishing
x is indeed independent. to accomplish this we return to the integral equation (3.14)
and retain the general gauge dependence. the equation can then readily be converted to a
dierential equation:

which can be integrated easily to give for small x

(3.24)

demonstrating that the term in g is indeed subleading and also that all the  dependence
vanishes at x = 0, so information about the xed point is  independent as expected from
the onshell nature of g(0).

we have shown in this section that in the presence of a mass for the matter multiplet
the full vertex is stabilized and driven to a nontrivial infrared xed point. in the above
analysis the mass for the matter multiplet has been included by hand; however we will show
in section v that a mass can be dynamically generated selfconsistently by coupling the
vertex equation to the corresponding dysonschwinger equation for the matter propagator.
in the next section we turn to a discussion of the inhomogeneous term z and why it can be
safely omitted.

iv. the inhomogeneous term z and the functions a and b.

in this section we analyse the dysonschwinger equations for the functions a and b with
which we have respectively dressed the matter and connexion supereld propagators. first
we consider the dysonschwinger equation for the matter propagator, shown schematically
in gure 3.

the dierence between the graphs on the left of gure 3 is easily computed to be

 i(a(p)  1)z d2 (p, )d2(p)(p, )  i

m(p)

a(p) z d2 (p, )(p, ).

(4.1)

9

we adopt the oneloop dressed approximation to the dysonschwinger equation in which
both vertices in gure 3 are fully dressed and all twoparticle irreducible corrections are
dropped [22]. in doing so the resulting integral equation can be cast in terms of g alone.

the graphs on the right hand side of gure 3 can be manipulated to obtain functions

multiplying the two superspace structures

z d2 (p, ) d2(p) (p, ),
z d2 (p, ) (p, );

(4.2)

comparison with equation (4.1) shows that the function multiplying the rst of these struc-
tures is to be identied with the contribution to the wavefunction renormalization a(p) and
the function which multiplies the second corresponds to the self energy m(p)/a(p), to which
we will return in the next section. the rst seagull graph on the right hand side gives
only an irrelevant pindependent contribution to the wavefunction renormalization while
the last graph on the right hand side of the gure contributes both to the wavefunction
renormalization and the self energy. evaluating the superspace parts of the last graph leads
to the following integral equation for a(p)

a(p) = 1 + (1+)a(p)

(4.3)

in the gauge  = 1 which we adopt throughout this paper, this reduces to unity, leav-
ing a constant a(p). note that this is in line with the result of reference [10], where the
wavefunction renormalization was computed to be

a(p) = (cid:16) p

(cid:17)2(1+)/n 2

.

(4.4)

we turn now to the connexion supereld and the function b(p). in standard largen
treatments [9, 10] the function b includes the eects of massless matter loops resummed to
leading order in 1/n, giving

therefore in the deep infrared we nd

b(p)  1 + /p.

10

z(x) = a1(x) b1/2(x)  x1/2

(4.5)

and the inhomogeneous term goes to zero and can be safely dropped compared with a
nonvanishing g(0) in a largen framework.

for completeness it is instructive to consider the function b outside this largen resum-
mation, and consider the dysonschwinger equation shown schematically in gure 4. again
we adopt the oneloop dressed approximation, which enables us to recast the equation in
terms of g alone.

converting to dimensionless variables, considering constant m and expanding the logarithm
as usual we can convert to an equivalent dierential equation in which we have approximated
g by its constant value at x = 0, noting from equation (3.16) that in doing so we have only
dropped terms of order o(x3):

from this analysis it is clear that even when the connexion propagator is not resummed to
leading order in 1/n, the inhomogeneous term z reduces to a nite constant in the infrared
and can still be dropped with safety, justifying fully our assumption in section iii.

v. mass.

in this section we demonstrate that a mass for the matter multiplet can be generated
dynamically when we feed the solution for the full vertex (3.16) into the dysonschwinger
equation for the matter propagator. the latter is shown schematically in gure 3, and now
we evaluate the terms in the graph on the right hand side which multiply the second of
the superspace structures in equation (4.2). evaluating the superspace integrals leaves the
following integral equation for the mass function

m(p) =

choosing again the gauge  = 1, we see that it removes the spurious infrared divergences
and simplies the equation considerably. after performing the angular integration and
expanding the resulting logarithms, we obtain in dimensionless variables

in the deep infrared x  m, and approximating g(x) by g(0), noting again that the
corrections to this approximation are of order o(x3) (see equation (3.16)); equation (5.3)
then admits the following approximate solution:

m(x)  m(0)(cid:0)1  ax  o(x2)(cid:1)

a > 0

(5.4)

which exhibits a constant dynamical mass m(0) and has the correct (decreasing) behaviour
away from x = 0; note that this solution is similar to the small x expansion of the mass
found using the same method for nonsupersymmetric qed3 in reference [15]. the solution
above is to be compared with the case when the vertex is chosen to satisfy the u(1) ward
identity for general momenta [10], where the solution for the mass behaves as

m(x) = m(0)ex2

 m(0)(cid:0)1  x2 + o(x4)(cid:1) .

the semiamputated vertex considered here only satises the ward identity at x = 0 where
the vertex is onshell, and therefore the smallx dependence may dier from the more
complete solution, though the qualitative (decreasing) behaviour is retained.

vi. conclusion.

in this paper we have proposed that the dynamical generation of a mass in n = 1
supersymmetric qed3 is selected by the dynamics over the massless alternative, for it sta-
bilizes the running gauge coupling against oscillations. in particular the picture which has

12

emerged from our analysis is that in the absence of a mass for the matter multiplet, the full
vertex oscillates in the infrared, leading to instability in the eective action. when a nite
dynamical mass is added, the infrared physics is stabilized and there exists a nontrivial in-
frared xed point. we have demonstrated that the incorporation of our full vertex solution
into the dysonschwinger equation for the matter propagator leads selfconsistently to the
dynamical generation of a mass.

supersymmetry has been kept manifest throughout by adopting a supereld formalism
which has the additional advantage of simplifying considerably the system of equations and
ward identities which would have to be solved in a component calculation. by working in a
general gauge we have retained enough freedom to remove infrared divergences which arise
from the propagation of spurious degrees of freedom in the connexion supereld [19, 20],
and we have been able to simplify the analysis signicantly. we have employed a largen
framework consistently throughout this paper; this in combination with the concept of a
semiamputated full vertex allowed us to decouple the dysonschwinger equations so that
the functions a and b used to dress the full propagators do not appear in the analysis of
the vertex.

there is the interesting possibility that the techniques employed in this paper and in
reference [15] could be extended to models in higher dimensions and with nonabelian
gauge groups.
