the dynamics and evolution of bianchi type i space-times is considered in the framework of
the four-dimensional truncation of a reduced theory obtained from the n = 2, d = 5 supergravity.
the general solution of the gravitational eld equations can be represented in an exact parametric
form. all solutions have a singular behavior at the initial/nal moment, except when the space-time
geometry reduces to the isotropic at case. generically the obtained cosmological models describe
an anisotropic, expanding or collapsing, singular universe with a non-inationary evolution for all
times.

i. introduction

the similarity between the d = 5 simple supergravity
(sugra) and d = 11 sugra has been recognized for
a long time [1,2]. the d = 11 sugra is supposed to
play a fundamental role as the low energy limit of the
m-theory [3]  an expected unied speculation for the
well-known ve consistent superstring theories. the eld
contents of the d = 11 sugra theory consist of the met-
ric, a single majorana spin- 3
2 fermion along with a (sin-
glet) three-form gauge potential, with neither n > 1
extensions nor matter coupling permitted [4]. the simple
d = 5 sugra, besides the metric gab, contains a spin-
2 eld a
3
a (a = 1, 2 is an internal index) and u (1) gauge
eld (one-form ba) which replaces the three-form gauge
eld in the d = 11 sugra. the primeval likeness
comes directly from the fact that the lagrangians of both
sugras are exactly of the same form, except for the
numbering of the gauge eld indices. in addition, their
dimensional reduction to d = 4 can be carried out in a
similar way [5]. furthermore, the d = 5 simple sugra
can be realized as a calabi-yau compactication of the
d = 11 sugra together with the truncation of the
scalar multiplets, which is always necessary since there
arises at least one scalar multiplet for any calabi-yau
compactication [6,7]. further resemblances between the
two sugras are related to the duality groups upon di-
mensional reduction and the world sheet structure of the
solitonic string of the d = 5 sugra [8].

thus the four-dimensional reduced eective action of
the n = 2, d = 5 sugra contains an additional
maxwell-like u (1) eld and a scalar eld regarded as ex-
ternal elds in ve dimensions which are contributed by
b, besides the ones coming from the metric gab as in the
traditional scheme for the kaluza-klein theory [912].
cosmological solutions to this model have been previ-
ously considered by balbinot, fabris and kerner [11,12].
for the case of spatial homogeneity and isotropy the gen-
eral solution is non-singular in the scale factor, but un-
stable due to the collapse to zero of the size of the fth
dimension [11,12]. biaxial (with two equal scale factors)
anisotropic solutions with a cylindrical homogeneous ve-
dimensional metric lead to singular solutions with pos-
itive gravitational coupling [12]. recently, an explicit
example of a manifestly u -duality covariant m-theory
cosmology in ve dimensions resulting from compacti-
cation on a calabi-yau three-fold has been obtained in
[13]. exact static solutions in n = 2, d = 5 sugra
have been found by pimentel [14], in a metric with cylin-
drical symmetry, with a particular case corresponding to
the exterior of a cosmic string.

the purpose of the present paper is to construct the
general solution to the gravitational eld equations of the
n = 2, d = 5 sugra as formulated in [11,12] for an
anisotropic triaxial (all directions have unequal scale fac-
tors) bianchi type i space-time. in this case the general
solution of the eld equations can be expressed in an ex-
act parametric form. for all cosmological solutions, the

singularity at the starting/ending time of the evolution
can not be avoided except in the isotropic limit consid-
ered in [11,12]. nevertheless, in the models analyzed in
this paper, the anisotropic universe has non-inationary
evolution for all times and for all values of parameters.

the present paper is organized as follows. the eld
equations of our model are written down in section ii.
in section iii the general solution of the eld equations
is obtained. we discuss our results and conclusions in
section iv.

ii. field equations, geometry and

consequences

the bosonic sector of n = 2, d = 5 sugra con-
tains the ve-dimensional metric gab and u (1) gauge
eld ba described by a lagrangian which possesses a
non-vanishing chern-simons term [1]

in this paper we use the fol-
lowing conventions and notations. the variables with
hats are ve-dimensional objects all other variables are
four-dimensional. upper case indices a, b, ... are used for
ve-dimensional space-time, greek indices , , ... and low
case indices i, j, ... are for four-dimensional space-time
and three-dimensional space respectively. the signature
is (, +, +, +, +).
assuming that the ve dimensional space-time has lo-
cally the structure of m 4  s1 with a four-dimensional
space-time m 4 whose spatial sections are homogeneous
and asymptotic at, then the ve-dimensional metric can
be decomposed along the standard kaluza-klein pattern

equations can be re-derived, in the string frame, from the
four-dimensional lagrangian [11,12]

via variation with respect to the elds g,  and . in
the lagrangian (6), the scale factor  is an analogue of
the brans-dicke eld whereas the origin of  is purely
supersymmetric.

the line element of an anisotropic homogeneous at

3pi hi, one can promptly nd the rela-

tional hubble factors, hi := ai/ai, and average hubble
factor, h := 1
tion 3h = v /v , where dot means the derivative with
respect to time t. in terms of those variables, the eld
equations (3) and the equations of motion for  and 
(4,5) coupling with the anisotropic bianchi type i geom-
etry take the concise forms

the physical quantities of interest in cosmology are the
expansion scalar , the mean anisotropy parameter a, the
shear scalar 2 and the deceleration parameter q dened
as [15]

looking for a ground state conguration we set, fol-
lowing [11,12], the kaluza-klein vector, a, equal to zero
and take the one-form potential ba to be b = 0 and
b4 = 3(x). under this ansatz, the ve-dimensional
gravitational eld equations for (1) reduce to a set of
four-dimensional equations

the sign of the deceleration parameter indicates
whether the cosmological model inates. a positive sign
corresponds to standard decelerating models whereas a
negative sign indicates inationary behavior.

equations

equation (11) can immediately be integrated to give

v  = ,

(13)

with   a constant of integration. from equations (10)
and (11) one can nd that the expressions of the elds
(t) and (t) have the following form

(t) = 0 cos(cid:18)z dt
+ 0(cid:19) ,
(t) = 0 + 0 sin(cid:18)z dt

where 0, 0 and 0 are constants of integration.

by summing equations (9) one gets

which can be transformed, by using equations (13) and

scribing the dynamics and evolution of a triaxial bianchi

it is worth noting that these two classes of solutions
corresponding to positive or negative values of  and 
are not independent. indeed, they can be related via a
duality transformation by changing the signs of , 
and  so that t(, , ) = t(, , ), ai(, , ) =
ai(, , ), i = 1, 2, 3, and v (, ) = v (, ) etc.
this duality relation can be obtained by a simple inspec-
tion of equations (23)-(26) and, therefore, all physical
quantities are invariant with respect to this transforma-
tion. moreover, the physical properties of the cosmo-
logical models presented here are strongly dependent on
the signs of the parameters  and . nevertheless, due
to the duality transformation, hereafter we will consider,
without loss of generality, the cases with positive  only.
for some particular values of , the general solutions
can be expressed in an exact non-parametric form, for in-
stance, an exact class solutions can be obtained for  =
3 . by introducing a new time variable  := 32

choosing t0 =  v0

by introducing a new variable  related to the physical

the isotropic limit can be achieved by taking  = 1
and, consequently, ki = 0, i = 1, 2, 3. it is worth not-

who extensively studied their physical properties. this
isotropic solution also provides a positive gravitational
coupling at the present time.

iv. discussions and final remarks

in order to study the physical properties of the bianchi
type i universe described by the eqs. (24)-(26) we need
to x rst the range of variation of the parameter .

4

there are no a priori limitations in choosing the admissi-
ble range of values, thus both positive and negative values

are permitted since the variable  = r dt/v can also be

negative. but from a physical point of view it is natu-
ral to impose the condition such that the gravitational
coupling  is always positive during the evolution of the
bianchi type i space-time in n = 2, d = 5 sugra. con-
sequently, we shall consider   (/2, /2). with this
choice, the universe for  < 1 starts its evolution in
the innite past (t  ) and ends at a nite moment
t = t0. for  > 1 the universe starts at t = t0 and ends
in an innite future with t  . (all discussion here
and hereafter are with respect to positive .)
as can be easily seen from equation (22), if  < 1 we
have v < 0 for all t. for these values of the parameters
the bianchi type i anisotropic universe collapses from an
initial state characterized by innite values of the vol-
ume scale factor and of the scale factors ai, i = 1, 2, 3, to
a singular state with all factors vanishing. but if  > 1,
the universe expands and v > 0 for all t. the expanding
bianchi type i universe starts its evolution at the initial
moment, t0, from a singular state with zero values of the
scale factors, ai(t0) = 0, i = 1, 2, 3.

another possible way to investigate the singularity be-
havior at the initial moment is to consider the sign of the
quantity ruu, where u is the vector tangent to the
geodesics; u = (1, 0, 0, 0) for the present model. from
the gravitational eld equations we easily obtain

r uu = 3h 2(q  a).

(43)

by using equations (27), (29) and (30) we can express
(43) as

ruu = 6h 2

sin 

 + sin 

.

(44)

for   /2 the sign of r uu is determined by the
sign of 1  . therefore we obtain

r uu < 0

for  > 1.

(45)

hence, the energy condition of hawking-penrose sin-
gularity theorems [16] is not satised for the solutions
corresponding to bianchi type i universes in the four-
dimensional reduced two scalar elds theory of n =
2, d = 5 sugra with  > 1. nevertheless, for those
solutions an initial singular state is unavoidable at the
initial moment t0.

since for  > 1 the bianchi type i universe starts its
evolution at the initial moment t = t0 (  /2) from a
singular state, therefore, the presence of a variable gravi-
tational coupling, , and of a supersymmetric eld, , in
an anisotropic geometry can not remove the initial sin-
gularity that mars the big-bang cosmology. at the initial
moment the degree of the anisotropy of the space-time is
maximal, with the initial value of the anisotropy param-
eter a(t0) = 2( + 1)/(  1). for t > t0 the universe
expands and the anisotropy parameter decreases.

the behavior of the volume scale factor, of the
anisotropy parameter and of the deceleration parameter
is presented for dierent values of  in figs. 1-3. the
evolution of the universe is non-inationary, with q > 0
for all t > t0. non-inationary behavior is a generic fea-
ture of most of the supersymmetric models. this is due
to the general fact that the eective potential for the in-
ation eld  in sugra typically is too curved, growing
as exp(c2/m), with c a parameter (typically o(1)) and
m the stringy planck mass [17]. the typical values of c
make ination impossible because the ination mass be-
comes of the order of the hubble constant. see also [17]
for a simple realization of hybrid ination in sugra.
in the present model the presence of the supersymmetric
eld  prevents the bianchi type i universe from inat-
ing.

in the far future, for   /2 and t   ( > 1),
we have v  , ai  , i = 1, 2, 3. in this limit the
anisotropy parameter becomes a non-zero constant and
the universe ends in a still anisotropic phase, but with a
decrease in the value of the anisotropy parameter a, as
compared with the initial one. therefore during its evo-
lution the bianchi type i universe cannot experience a
transition from the anisotropic phase to the isotropic at
geometry. the time evolution of the gravitational cou-
pling  and of the supersymmetric eld  is represented
in fig. 4. the -eld is positive for all values of time.

in the present paper we have investigated the evolu-
tion and dynamics of a bianchi type i space-time in a
sugra toy-model, obtained by dimensional reduction
of the n = 2, d = 5 sugra. the inclusion of the su-
persymmetric term gives some particular features to this

5

cosmological model, by preventing the universe from in-
ating and attaining completely isotropy. but globally
there is a decrease in the degree of anisotropy of the ge-
ometry. hence this model can be used to describe only
a specic, well-determined period of the evolution of our
universe.

appendix a: some exact forms for

physical time

for a large class of values of the parameter  the gen-
eral solution of the gravitational eld equations can be
expressed in a closed explicit form. the variation of the
physical time t is determined by the integral equation
(23). after a trick manipulation, one can rewrite this
equation in the following form

for arbitrary , this integral can not be closed. fortu-
nately, for integer values of , the physical time t can be
expressed in an explicit form as a function of . some of
these exact forms of the time function are listed in the
