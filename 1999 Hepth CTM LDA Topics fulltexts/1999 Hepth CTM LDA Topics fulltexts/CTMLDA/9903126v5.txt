abstract

considering a class of (2,0)-super-yang-mills multiplets that

accommodate a pair of independent gauge potentials in connec-

tion with a single symmetry group, we present here their coupling

to ordinary matter and to non-linear -models in (2,0)-superspace.

the dynamics and the couplings of the gauge potentials are dis-

cussed and the interesting feature that comes out is a sort of chi-

rality for one of the gauge potentials once light-cone coordinates

are chosen.

the raise of interest on the investigation of geometrical aspects and quan-

tum behaviour of two-dimensional systems, such as yang-mills theories and

non-linear -models, especially if endowed with supersymmetry, has been

broadly renewed in connection with the analysis of superstring background

congurations [1, 2] and the study of conformal eld theories and integrable

models.

as for supersymmetries dened in two space-time dimensions, they may

be generated by p left-handed and q right-handed independent majorana

charges: these are the so-called (p, q)-supersymmetries [1, 3] and are of fun-

damental importance in the formulation of the heterotic superstrings [4].

motivated by the understanding of a number of features related to the

dynamics of world-sheet gauge elds [5] and the possibility of nding new

examples of conformal eld theories, one has considered the superspace for-

mulation of a (2, 0)-yang-mills model [6, 7] enlarged by the introduction of

an extra gauge potential that transforms under the same simple gauge group

along with the ordinary yang-mills eld of the theory.

in the works of refs.[6, 7], one has discussed the role of the further gauge

potential on the basis of the constraints upon eld-strength superelds in

the algebra of gauge-covariant derivatives in (2, 0)-superspace. the minimal

coupling of this somewhat less-constrained yang-mills model to matter super-

elds has been contemplated, and it has been ascertained that the additional

gauge potential corresponds to non-interacting degrees of freedom in the

abelian case. for non-abelian symmetries, the extra yang-mills eld still

decouples from matter, though it presents self-interactions with the gauge

sector [6].

2

it is therefore our purpose in this letter to nd out a possible dynamical

role for the additional gauge potential discussed in refs.[6, 7], by means of

its coupling to matter superelds that describe the coordinates of the kahler

manifold adopted as the target space of a (2, 0) non-linear -model [8]. to

pursue such an investigation, we shall gauge the isometry group of the -

model under consideration, while working in (2, 0)-superspace; then, all we

are left with is the task of coupling the (2, 0)-yang-mills extended super-

multiplets of ref.[6] to the superelds that dene the (2, 0) -model whose

gaugind is carried out.

the coordinates we choose to parametrise the (2, 0)-superspace are given

by

za  (x++, x; , ),

(1)

where x++, x denote the usual light-cone variables, whereas ,  stand for

complex right-handed weyl spinors. the supersymmetry covariant deriva-

tives are taken as:

and

d+   + i++

d+   + i++,

(2)

(3)

where ++ (or ) represents the derivative with respect to the space-time

coordinate x++ (or x). they fulll the algebra:

d2

+ = d2

+ = 0

{d+, d+} = 2i++.

(4)

3

with this denition for d and d, one can check that:

ei +d+ei + = ,

ei + d+ei + = .

(5)

(6)

the fundamental matter superelds we shall deal with are the chiral

scalar and left-handed spinor superelds, whose respective component-eld

expressions are given by:

(x; , ) = ei ++( + ),

(x; , ) = ei ++( + );

(7)

 and  are scalars, whereas  and  stand respectively for right- and left-

handed weyl spinors.

this sort of chirality constraint yields the following component-eld ex-

pansions for i and i:

i(x; , ) = i(x) + i(x) + i ++i(x),

i(x; , ) = i(x) + i(x) + i ++i(x).

(8)

the most general superspace action involving  and  with interactions

governed by dimensionless coupling parameters f1 and f2, reads

s = z d2xdd[i(    ) +  +

+ m( + ) +

+ f1p (, )(    ) +

+ f2q(, ) ],

(9)

4

where m is a mass parameter, and p and q denote real polynomials in 
and .

we now assume that both  and  transform under an arbitrary compact

and simple gauge group, g, according to

 = r(),

 = s(),

(10)

where r and s are matrices that respectively represent a gauge group ele-

ment in the representations under which  and  transform. taking into

account the constraint on  and , and bearing in mind the exponential

representation of r and s, we nd that the gauge parameter superelds, ,

satisfy the same sort of constraint. it can therefore be expanded as follows:

(x; , ) = ei ++( + ),

(11)

where  is a scalar and  is a right-handed spinor.

the kinetic part of the action (9) can be made invariant under the lo-

cal transformations (10) by minimally coupling gauge potential superelds,
(x; , ) and v (x; , ), according to the minimal coupling prescriptions:

sinv = z d2xdd{i[ ehv ()  (  )ehv ] + ehv },

(12)

where the gauge-covariant derivatives are dene in the sequel.

the yang-mills supermultiplets are introduced by means of the gauge-

covariant derivatives which, according to the discussion of ref. [6], are dened

as below:

+  d+ + +,

++  ++ + ++

+  d+,

(13)

    ig,

(14)

and

5

with the gauge superconnections +, ++ and  being all lie-algebra-

valued. the gauge couplings, g and h, can in principle be taken dierent;

nevertheless, this would not mean that we are gauging two independent sym-

metries. this is a single simple gauge group, g, with just one gauge-supereld

parameter, . it is the particular form of the (2, 0)-minimal coupling (re-

alized by the exponentiation of v and the connection present in ) that

opens up the freedom to associate dierent coupling parameters associated

to v and . + and ++ can be both expressed in terms of the real scalar
supereld, v (x; , ), according to:

and

+ = egv (d+egv )

++ = 

i
2

d+[egv (d+egv )].

(15)

(16)

therefore, the gauging of the -model isometry group shall be achieved by

minimally coupling the action of the (2, 0)-supersymmetric -model to the

gauge superelds v and , as we shall see in what follows.

to stablish contact with a component-eld formulation and to actually

identify the presence of an aditional gauge potential, we write down the -

expansions for v and :

v (x; , ) = c +     +  v++

and

(x; , ) =

1
2

(a + ib) + i( + i)

 (m + in).

1
2

+ i( + i) +

(17)

(18)

a, b and v++ are the light-cone components of the gauge potential

elds; , ,  and  are left-handed majorana spinors; m, n and c are real

scalars and  is a complex right-handed spinor.

it can be shown that the gauge transformations of the -component elds

above read as follows:

c =

2
h

m,

v++ =

m,

m =

g

++m,

n =

g
 = 0,

++e,

 = 0,

(19)

and they suggest that we may take h = g, so that the v++-component should

be identied as the light-cone partner of a,

v++  a++;

(20)

this procedure yields two component-eld gauge potentials: a  (a0, a1)

7

and b(x).

at this point, we should set a non-trivial remark: the  -component of

 should be identied as below:

m + in = i++(a + ib),

(21)

so as to ensure that f  a  a appear as a component accomodated

in the eld-strength supereld dened by:

[+, ]  x = igd+  +.

(22)

m and n do not correspond therefore to independent degree of freedom, and

they are from now on suppressed from our considerations. the identication

of eq.(21 does not break supersymmetry, for  and  are non-dynamical

degrees of freedom and drop out from the eld-strength supereld x.

in

practice, once this identication has been adopted,  carries two bosonic

and two fermionic degrees of freedom.

using the eld-strength dened in (22), we can build up the gauge invari-

ant kinetic lagrangian:

skin = 

1

8g2 z d2xdd xx.

(23)

this action yields the component-eld lagrangian below:

lkin = lkin(, , ) + lkin(a) + lkin(b, c),

(24)

where

lkin(, , ) =

i
8

(  i  

)


 ++ ( + i  ),

(25)

8

with a


 b = (a)b  a(b),

lkin(a) =

1
2

a(2  )a =

1
2

ara,

(26)

and

lkin(b, c) =

1
8

(++b  ++c)2 =

1
8

(b c)k(b c)t,

(27)

where the superscript t stands for transposition. notice that, as already

mentioned above,  and  are not present in the kinetic lagrangian (25).

next, we can see that r and k are singular matrices, so it is necessary

to write down a gauge xing lagrangian, which is given by:

sgf =

1

8 z d2xdd gg
(a)2 

1
2
1
(++b + ++c)2,
8

i
4

= 



(  i   )++( + i  ) +

(28)

where g = d+v  id+. using the gauge-xing, eq.(28), along with

equations (26) and (27), we are ready to write down the propagators for a,

b and c:

haai = 

hbbi = 

( + ),

2i
2
8i
22 (  1)2
8i
22 ( + 1),

,

hbci = hcbi =

hcci =

8i
22 (  1).

(29)

the c-eld exhibits a compensating character, as eqs.(19) indicate. on the
other hand, the eld redenition b  b  h

g c allows us to suppress

9

c from the action.

in a way or another, c is shown to be non-physical.

here, we take the viewpoint to keep c as compensating; its elimination is

accomplished by choosing the (2, 0)-wess-zumino-gauge, rather than upon
the eld reshuing b 7 b. expressing the action of equation (12)

in terms of component elds, and adopting the (2, 0)-version of the wess-

zumino gauge, the matter-gauge sector lagrangian reads: reads as bellow:

lmattergauge = 22  iga[++  c.c]  iga++[  c.c] +

+ g++b  g2a++a + 2i + ga +

+ ig[( +  + i  i)  c.c]  2i ++  ga+  +

+ .

(30)

one immediately checks that the extra gauge eld, b, does not decouple

from the matter sector. our point of view of leaving the superconnection

 as a complex supereld naturally introduced this extra gauge potential

in addition to the usual gauge eld a. b behaves as a second gauge eld.

the fact that it yelds a massless pole of order two in the spectrum may harm

the unitarity. however, the mixing with the c-component of v , which is a

compensating eld, indicates that we should couple them to external currents

and analyse the imaginary part of the current-current amplitude at the pole.

in so doing, this imaginary part turns out to be positive-denite, and so no

ghosts are present. this ensures us to state that b behaves as a physical

gauge eld:

it has dynamics and couples to matter.

its only peculiarity

regards the presence of a single component in the light-cone coordinates.

the b-eld plays rather the role of a chiral gauge potential. despite the

presence of the pair of gauge elds, a gauge-invariant mass term cannot

10

be introduced, since b does not carry the b++-component, contrary to what

happens with a. let us now turn to the coupling of the two gauge potentials,

a and b, to a non-linear -model.

it is our main purpose henceforth to carry out the coupling of a (2, 0) -

model to the relaxed gauge superelds of the ref. [6], and show that the extra

vector-degrees of freedom do not decouple from the matter elds (that is the

target space coordinates). the extra gauge potential obtained upon relaxing

constraints can therefore acquire a dynamical signicance by means of the

coupling between the -model and the yang-mills elds of ref.[6]. moreover,

this system might provide another example of a gauge-invariant conformal

eld theory.

the (2, 0)-supersymmetric -model action written in (2, 0)-superspace

reads [8]:

s = 

i

2 z d2xdd(cid:20)ki(, )i  c.c.(cid:21),

(31)

where the target space vector ki(, ) can be expressed as the gradient of a
real scalar (kahler) potential, k(, ), whenever the wess-zumino term is

absent (i.e., torsion-free case) [1]:

ki(, ) = ik(, ) 


i k(, ).

(32)

we shall draw our attention to kahlerian target manifolds of the coset

type, g/h. the generators of the isometry group, g, are denoted by q( =

1, ..., dimg), whereas the isotropy group, h, has its generators denoted by

q (  = 1, ..., dimh). the transformations of the isotropy group are linearly
realised on the superelds  and , and act as matrix multiplication, just

11

like for at target manifolds. the isometry transformations instead are non-

linear, and their innitesimal action on the points of g/h can be written

as:

and

i = ki

()

 i = ki( ),

(33)

(34)

where ki and ki are respectively holomorphic and anti-holomorphic killing

vectors of the target manifold. the nite versions of the isometry transfor-

mations above read:

and

with

i = exp(l.k)i

i = exp(l.k) i

l.ki  (cid:20)ki





j , i(cid:21)= i.

(35)

(36)

(37)

though the kahler scalar potential can always be taken h-invariant,

isometry transformations induce on k a variation given by:

k = [(ik)ki + ( ik)ki] = [() + ( )],

(38)

where the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic functions  and  can be

determined up to a purely imaginary quantity as below:

(ik)ki

   + im(, )

(39)

12

and

( ik)ki    im(, ).

(40)

the real functions m, along with the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic

functions  and , play a crucial role in discussing the gauging of the

isometry group of the target manifold [9, 10]. therefore, by virtue of the
transformation (38) and the constraints imposed on  and , it can be

readily checked that the superspace action (31) is invariant under global

isometry transformations.

proceeding further with the study of the isometries, a relevant issue in the

framework of (2, 0)-supersymmetric -models is the gauging of the isometry

group g of the kahlerian target manifold. this in turn means that one

should contemplate the minimal coupling of the (2, 0)--model to the yang-

mills supermultiplets of (2, 0)-supersymmetry [11]. an eventual motivation

for pursuing such an analysis is related to the 2-dimensional conformal eld

theories.

it is known that 2-dimensional -models dene conformal eld

theories provided that suitable constraints are imposed upon the target space

geometry [1, 2]. now, the coupling of these models to the yang-mills sector

might hopefully yield new conformal eld theories of interest.

the study of (2, 0)-supersymmetric yang-mills theories has been carried

out in ref.[11] and the gauging of -model isometries in (2, 0)-superspace

has been considered in ref.[12]. on the other hand, our alternative less-

constrained version of (2, 0)-gauge multiplets indicates that the elimination

of some constraints on the gauge superconnections and on eld-strength su-

perelds leads to the appearence of an extra gauge potential that shares a

13

common gauge eld in partnership with the usual yang-mills eld. we wish

henceforth to analyse the coupling of our loose (2, 0)-multiplets to non-linar

-model.

to write down the local version of the isometry transformations (33) and

(34), we have to replace the global parameter  by a pair of chiral and
antichiral superelds, (x; , ) and (x; , ), by virtue of the constraints
satised by  and . this can be realised according to:

and



i = exp(l.k)i



i = exp(l .k) i.

(41)

(42)

in order to get closer to the case of global transformations, and to express

all gauge variations exclusively in terms of the supereld parameters , we
propose a eld redenition that consist in replacing  by a new supereld,
, as it follows:

i  exp(ilv.k) i.

(43)

from the expression for the gauge transformation of the prepotential v , it

can be shown that:

exp(ilv .k) = exp(l.k)exp(ilv.k)exp(l k),

(44)

and i consequently transform with the gauge parameter :



i = exp(lk) i,

(45)

14

which innitesimally reads:

 i = (x;  )ki( ).

(46)

now, an innitesimal isometry transformation induces on the modied

kahler potential, k(, ), a variation given by:

where

k(, ) = ( + ),

 = ( ik)ki( ) + im(, ),

(47)

(48)

with  denoting a partial derivative with respect to . the isometry variation

k computed above reads just like a kahler transformation and is a direct
consequence of the existence of the real scalar m(, ), as discussed in refs

[9, 10].

the form of the isometry variation of k(, ) suggests the introduction
of a pair of chiral and antichiral superelds, () and ( ), whose respec-

tive gauge transformations are xed in such a way that they compensate

the change of k under isometries. this can be achieved by means of the

lagrangian dened as:

l = i[k(, )  ()  ( )]i +

 i[k(, )  ()  ( )] i,

(49)

where the covariant derivatives i and  i are dened in perfect

analogy to what is done in the case of the bosonic -model:

i  i  g

ki

()

(50)

15

and

 i   i  g



ki( ).

(51)

finally, all we have to do in order that the lagrangian l given above be

invariant under local isometries is to x the gauge variations of the auxiliary
scalar superelds  and . if the latter are so chosen that:

and

(i)ki

() = ()

( i )ki( ) = ( ),

then it can be readily veried that the kahler-transformed potential

[k(, )  ()  ( )]

(52)

(53)

(54)

is isometry-invariant, and the lagrangian l of eq. (49) is indeed symmetric

under the gauged isometry group.

the interesting point we would like to stress is that the extra gauge

degrees of freedom accommodated in the component-eld b(x) of the su-

perconnection  behave as a genuine gauge eld that shares with a the

coupling to matter and to -model [6]. this result can be explicitly read

o from the component-eld lagrangian projected out of the supereld la-

grangian l. we therefore conclude that our less constrained (2, 0)-gauge

theory yields a pair of gauge potentials that naturally transform under the

action of a single compact and simple gauge group.
