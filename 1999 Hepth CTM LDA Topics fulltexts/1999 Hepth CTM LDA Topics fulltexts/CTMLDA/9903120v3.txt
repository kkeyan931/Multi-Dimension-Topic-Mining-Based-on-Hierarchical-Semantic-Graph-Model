abstract

we study the proposed duality between the 5-dimensional supergravity/superstring
on ads3  s2 and the 2-dimensional n = (0, 4) scft dened on the boundary of ads-
space. we construct explicitly the n = (0, 4) scft by imposing the quiver projection

developed by douglas-moore [14] on the n = (4, 4) scft of symmetric orbifold, which
is proposed to be the dual of the 6-dimensional supergravity/superstring on ads3  s3.
we explore in detail the spectrum of chiral primaries in this quiver scf t2. we
compare it with the kaluza-klein spectrum on ads3  s2 and check the consistency
between them. we further emphasize that orbifolding of bulk theory should not corre-

spond to orbifolding of the boundary cft in the usual sense of two dimensional cft,

rather corresponds to the quiver projection. we observe that these are not actually

equivalent with each other when we focus on the multi-particle states.

1 introduction

ads3/cf t2-duality has been understood most successfully among the several proposals

of adsd+1/cf td-duality [1, 2, 3] in general dimensions. this is due to the fact that the

two dimensional conformal symmetry is very powerful to analyse the spectrum, and three

dimensional gravity with a negative cosmological term can be quantized by recasting it to

chern-simons theory [4, 5]. among other things, one of the most remarkable success is the

complete agreement between the bps kaluza-klein (kk) spectrum of supergravity theory
(sugra) on ads3s3m 4 (with m 4 = t 4 or k3) and the spectrum of chiral primary states
of n = (4, 4) scf t2 with the target manifold symn (m 4) [6, 7, 8]. however, analyses on

the models with less supersymmetries are still far from complete. in this paper we shall focus
on the correspondence between the 5-dimensional sugra on ads3  s2 and the n = (0, 4)
scf t2 dened on the boundary of ads3.

the most general examples which realize this geometry in the near horizon limit are
given by considering the m-theory compactied on some calabi-yau 3-fold m 6 (including
the cases m 6 = t 6, t 2  k3) [1, 9, 10], and we can construct the boundary n = (0, 4)
scf t2 by making m5-brane wind around a suitable supersymmetric 4-cycle p in m 6 with
non-vanishing triple self-intersection: p 3 6= 0. although it is known that these cf t2 can
thoroughly reproduce the correct bekenstein-hawking entropy in the microscopic level, it is

still a non-trivial problem to analyse the detailed spectra of chiral primaries. the present

work is motivated by this fact.

to resolve the diculty to study the n = (0, 4) scf t2 derived from this conguration of

m5, we shall choose another way. that is, we will work out in a t-dualized framework. we
focus on the limited examples m 6 = t 6 or t 2  k3 through this paper, and can easily nd
that the above brane conguration of m5 is equivalent by t-duality to the system of d1-d5-

tn5 in iib string theory. (here tn5 means taub-nut 5-brane, also sometimes called

kk 5-brane, which is dened as a taub-nut solution in the transversal 4-dimensional

space). we take this brane conguration as the starting point to analyse the n = (0, 4)

scf t2 following the several authors [11, 12, 13]. the advantage to do so is as follows: the

d1-d5 system leads to the well-known n = (4, 4) scf t2 we already mentioned, which is

nely understood at least as a cft of symmetric orbifold, and putting these branes at the
location of singularity of taub-nut ( ale) can be also described by the familiar procedure

1

[14], which is realized by imposing suitable projection on the chan-paton (cp) indices. we

shall call this projection as the quiver projection through this paper. in this manner we can

reduce our problem to a tractable one. we will dene the hilbert space of the desired (0, 4)

scf t2 by directly imposing the quiver projection on that of the (4, 4) scf t2 as a symmetric

orbifold theory. although the quiver (0,4) scf t2 dened in this way describes only the

symmetric orbifold point of the moduli space, it is expected that we can analyse the spectrum

which are stable under marginal deformations by means of this scf t2. after carrying out

the detailed analyses on chiral primaries in the quiver scf t2, we will nd out the complete

agreement between the chiral primary states and the spectrum of kk excitations in the 5d
sugra on ads3  s2 under the maldacena limit.

this paper will be organized as follows:

in section 2 we give a short review about some known results of the 5-dimensional sugra
with ads3 s2-geometry. particularly, we demonstrate the brane conguration on which our
construction of the boundary scf t2 is based.

our main discussions will be presented in section 3 and 4. we there give our proposal

of the boundary n = (0, 4) scf t2 as the one constructed by making use of the quiver

techniques [14], and explore the detailed spectrum of the chiral primary states. our analysis

of spectrum consists of three parts; the single particles in the untwisted sector, the single

particles in the various twisted sectors, and lastly we discuss the spectrum of the general

multi-particle states. we will nd out the complete agreement between the bps kk spectrum
of the ads3  s2-sugra and the chiral primaries in the quiver (0,4) scf t2. we will also
emphasize, especially in relation to the analysis on multi-particles, that our scf t2 dened

by the quiver techniques is not equivalent with that dened by the usual zq-orbifoldization.

we observe that the results of sugra support the quiver (0,4) scf t2, not the one obtained

by zq-orbifoldization.

in section 5 we summarize our results and give a few comments about open problems.

2 5d sugra on ads3  s2

2

in this section we briey survey some known results with respect to the 5-dimensional
sugra on ads3  s2 for later convenience. we begin with the simplest example: m-
theory compactied on m 6 = t 6. we can also present the similar arguments for the case of
m 6 = t 2  k3.

for the 6-torus m 6 = t 6, the m5-brane wrapped around a suitable susy 4-cycle which we

previously mentioned means nothing but the three intersecting 5-branes [15]. let (x5, x6, . . . , x11)
be the coordinates along the internal space m 6, and consider the following 5-brane congu-
ration (we regard x0 as the time coordinate);

 q1 m5s extending along the (016789),
 q2 m5s extending along the (01567 11),
 q3 m5s extending along the (01589 11).

the 11-dimensional metric corresponding to this brane conguration is given as follows [15];

ds2

11 = (h1h2h3)2/3 {(h1h2h3)1((dx0)2 + (dx1)2) + (h1h2)1((dx6)2 + (dx7)2)
+ (h2h3)1((dx5)2 + (dx11)2) + (h3h1)1((dx8)2 + (dx9)2) + (dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2))o ,

(2.1)
where (r, , ) stands for the spherical coordinates along the (x2, x3, x4)-directions which are

transversal to all of the branes, and the harmonic functions hi in this transversal space should

be dened as

hi(r) def= 1 +

2lp qi
2rv1/3  1 +

lp qi
2rv1/3 .

(2.2)

in the expressions of these harmonic functions lp means the 11-dimensional planck length
(which is dened, in our convention, by g11 = 167l9
p from the 11-dimensional newton
constant g11), 2  4 means the area of unit 2-dimensional sphere and we set the volume
of the internal space m 6 as vol(m 6) = v (2lp )6. under the maldacena limit, that is,

d  q1q2q3  , with l  lp (cid:18)d
v (cid:19)

(2.3)

this metric reduces to that of ads3  s2  m 6;

where we set u = 2lr, x = x0 + x1.

(2.4)

it is proposed [1] that the boundary cft for this example should correspond to an n =
(0, 4) scf t2 dened on the triple intersection of m5s (x0, x1-directions). this cft is the
simplest example among those studied in [9, 10] and was rst considered in [15] in the context

of the microscopic analysis on black-hole entropy. its central charge can be evaluated under

the large n limit (2.3) by counting the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. we can

3l
2g3

also evaluate it by means of the famous formula by brown-hennaux [16] c =

according to

the discussion given in [17]. recalling that the 3-dimensional newton constant g3 is computed

as

, (2.5)

we can immediately obtain the familiar central charge c = 6d which reproduces the correct

bekenstein-hawking entropy.

although this evaluation seems satisfactory, this is not the whole story in the ads3/cf t2-

correspondence. this scft dened on the triple intersection of 5-branes is not so powerful

to analyse the detailed structure of spectrum. therefore, we shall take a dierent framework.

it is easy to nd the following equivalence by t-duality;

m/(t 6(56789 11))


q1 m5 (016789)
q2 m5 (01567 11)
q3 m5 (01589 11)

=

iia/(t 5(56789))

 iib/( t 5(56789))


t 5t 6t 7

q1 ns5 (016789)
q2 d4 (01567)
q3 d4 (01589)

q1 t n5 (016789)
q2 d1 (01)
q3 d5 (016789)

.
(2.6)

in the last line t n5 (016789) strictly means that the transversal space (x2, x3, x4, x5) is
the taub-nut space with the monopole charge q1 (the s1-ber is along x5). lastly, let
us consider the decompactication limit of taub-nut space, which means (x2, x3, x4, x5)
becomes the ale space ale(aq11)  c2/zq1.

in this way we have led to the system of q1  q1q2 d1 and q1  q1q3 d5 wrapped around
t 4(6789), which are located at the singularity of the orbifold c2/zq1 (the 2345th-directions).
(the origin of the extra factor q1 in the brane charges is the existence of mirror images by
the orbifold zq1-action.) this brane conguration leads to the geometry ads3  s3/zq1  t 4.
some analyses on this ads3 geometry were given in [11] and, the studies from the viewpoints

of string theory along the same line as [18] were presented in [12]. however, we shall take a

4

route which is dierent from them and is rather analogous to the works [19, 20, 21, 22]. the

familiar techniques to put d-branes at the locations of orbifold singularities were invented by

douglas-moore [14] and we shall call this procedure the quiver projection in this paper. in

the next section we will construct the boundary scft by means of this projection from the

well-known (4, 4)-scft corresponding to the q1d1-q5d5 system which has the near-horizon
geometry ads3  s3  m 4. furthermore, we will explore the spectrum of chiral primaries in
this quiver (0, 4)-scft, and will observe how we can get the complete agreement with the
kk-spectrum of 5d sugra on ads3  s2. here we should comment on the work [13]:
is there carefully discussed that the perturbative degrees of freedom in such a quiver scft

it

as above are completely reproduced also in the u-dualized framework of intersecting branes

by incorporating the non-perturbative bps states of the string junctions [23], although the

concrete analysis on the chiral primaries as in the present paper are not given.

in the case of m 6 = t 2  k3 we can likewise t-dualize the orginal system, at least for
the elliptic k31. we can again arrive at the q1d1-q5d5 system such that d5s are wrapped
around k3 and all of the branes are located at the orbifold point of c2/zq1. we can also
make up the boundary (0, 4) scf t2 by the quiver projection, but there is one subtle point.

it is known [9, 10] that the central charge of this boundary cft suers quantum correction,
when m 6 is a curved manifold. it seems dicult to realize this correction in the framework of

our quiver scf t2. however, since this correction becomes negligible if taking the maldacena

limit, we can expect it works in the k3 case, too.

to close this section let us present the bps kk-spectra on ads3  s2  m 6 sugra
(m 6 = t 6, t 2  k3) which are given in [24, 6, 12, 25]. these spectra should be encoded to
the family of the short representations of super lie group sl(2, r)l  su(1, 1|2)r describing
the symmetry of ads3  s2-sugra. the general irreducible representations of sl(2, r)l 
su(1, 1|2)r are classied by three half integers (h, h, j)  1
2 z0. h denotes
the highest weight of sl(2, r)l-factor and h, j correspond to those of su(1, 1|2)r. the bps
condition can simply read as h = j. we here express the each short representation by the
notation (j ; s), where s def= h  h  h  j denotes the spin, in the similar manner as
[6]. actually s is equal to the spin of the lowest component of the bps multiplet in the

2z0  1

2z0  1

ads3-space.

1of course, the moduli space of elliptic k3 is merely a subspace of the full moduli space of k3. but our

concern in this paper is to evaluate the spectrum that does not depend on the generic value of moduli.

5

under these preparations the bps kk-spectrum for ads3  s2  t 6 can be written as

follows;

(2.7)

sugra(t 6)  h()

hsugra(t 6) = h(+)
h(+)
sugra(t 6) = (1 ; 2) + 15(1 ; 1) + 14(1 ; 0)
+

sugra(t 6),



xn=2 {(n ; 2) + 15(n ; 1) + 15(n ; 0) + (n ; 1)} ,

in these expressions h(+)

sugra correspond to the spaces of the multiplets in which

for ads3  s2  t 2  k3, we can also write down the spectrum in the similar manner;

hsugra(t 2  k3) = h(+)
h(+)
sugra(t 2  k3) = (1 ; 2) + 23(1 ; 1) + 22(1 ; 0)

(2.8)

the mass spectrum of kk excitations is given from the values of conformal weights by

the famous formula [2, 9, 6];

l2m2 = (h + h)(h + h  2)  (2j + s)(2j + s  2).

(2.9)

3 quiver n = (0, 4) scf t2 as boundary cft

as was demonstrated in the previous seciton, the situation we should study is summarized

as follows;

 q1 d1 extending along (x0, x1).
 q5 d5 extending along (x0, x1, x6, x7, x8, x9), and the space along (x6, x7, x8, x9) is m 4 =

t 4, k3.

6

 the space (x2, x3, x4, x5) is the orbifold c2/zq1, and all of the branes sit at the orbifold

singular point x2 =    = x5 = 0.

here we set q1  q1q2, q5  q1q3.

notice that our orbifold group zq1 acts along the directions transverse to all of the branes.
it is dierent from the situations intensively studied in [14], in which the orbifold group
acts along (x6, x7, x8, x9)-directions and one can gain a natural interpretation of kronheimer-

nakajimas theorem with respect to the instantons on ale spaces [26] by means of the brane

theory.

nevertheless, we can apply the same techniques and can easily write down the inner and

outer quiver diagrams to encode the matter contents. by this prescription we can obtain

an n = (0, 4) supersymmetric theory which is an example of the general models with (0, 4)

susy discussed in [27, 28], called adhm gauged linear -model. in principle the ir limit

of its higgs branch will provide us the desired n = (0, 4) scf t2.

however, there are subtle points. in the quantum level it is not easy to determine exactly

the low energy eective theory of the adhm linear -model, because we only have less

supersymmetries. moreover, even in the cases with n = (4, 4) susy, the famous proposal
of the target space symq1q5(m 4) is still a conjecture. no one succeeded in justifying this
proposal completely from the viewpoint of two-dimensional quantum gauge theory.2

this (4, 4) -model on symq1q5(m 4) nonetheless has a great success in ads3/cf t2-
duality [30, 6, 7, 31, 8]. so it seems to be the model worth taking as a good starting point.

in order to dene our boundary n = (0, 4) scf t2, we shall directly carry out the quiver
projection on the n = (4, 4) orbifold scf t2 on symq1q5(m 4) in place of taking the ir limit
of the adhm linear -model. this is our standpoint on which the analyses in this paper will

be based, and let us rst clarify the denition of hilbert space of this theory.

3.1 hilbert space of quiver scf t2

in this subsection we present the explicit denition of the quiver projection to the hilbert
space of symq1q5(m 4) scf t2.

2in fact, there is a dierent proposal of the ir eective theory [29]. this has the same degrees of freedom,
but a dierent discrete symmetry which should be gauged as orbifold cf t2. so, it may lead to the dierent
spectrum of chiral primaries.

7

for the time being we discuss the simpler example: m 4 = t 4. let ,  =  be the
spinor indices in the (x2, x3, x4, x5)-space and a, a =  be those in the (x6, x7, x8, x9)-space
(compactied on t 4).

the description of the n = (4, 4) scf t2 on symq1q5(t 4) is elementary. we have 4q1q5
numbers of free bosons x a a
(ai) (a = 0, . . . , q11 color indices,
i = 0, . . . , q5  1 avor indices) as the fundamental elds, which roughly correspond to
the degrees of freedom of the 1-5 open strings. the superconformal symmetry is realized

(ai) and free fermions  a

(ai),   a

by the following currents (we only write the left-mover.);

(ai) x bb

(ai) 

ab  ab x a a

(ai).

these generate the n = 4 (small) superconformal algebra (sca) with central charge c =
6q1q5. (the usual convention of su(2)-current is j i (z)  i
j (z) (i = 1, 2, 3).) the sub-
algebra of zero-modes {l1, l0, ga
0 } and their counterpart of right-mover composes
the super lie algebra su(1, 1|2)l  su(1, 1|2)r corresponding to the symmetry supergroup
in the ads3  s3 geometry.

1/2, j 

according to the general theory of orbifold cf t2 [32], we have various twisted sectors

labeled by the discrete symmetry group sq1q5. each of them is dened as the fock space of
bosonic and fermionic free elds with the twisted boundary conditions associated to g  sq1q5;

(ai)( + 2) = g((ai))(),

(3.2)

where (ai)() denotes x a a
should have the next structure;

(ai),  a

(ai),   a

(ai). the total hilbert space of this orbifold theory

h(4,4) = 

 mgsq1q5

sq1q5

hg


.

(3.3)

here hg (g  sq1q5) denotes the fock space of the g-twisted elds, and the superscript
sq1q5 indicates the sq1q5-invariant subspace. this hilbert space (3.3) can be also expressed
[33] as follows;

h(4,4) = m[g]yq1q5

h[g].

8

(3.4)

here the direct sum is taken over the set of all the conjugate class of sq1q5 (which is identied
with the set of young tableaus of q1q5 boxes), and we set

h[g] = mh[g]

(hh)c(h),

(3.5)

where c(h)  {g  sq1q5

: gh = hg} denotes the centralizer of h.

let us now consider the quiver projection of the (4, 4) scf t2. since the hilbert space of

(4, 4) theory (3.3) (or (3.4)) is dened as the fock space of free elds with various boundary

conditions (3.2), it is enough to dene the suitable projections [14] for each of the free elds

with these conditions. to this aim it may be convenient to rewrite the indices (ai) (a =
0, . . . , q1  1, i = 0, . . . , q5  1) as ((a, j) (i, j)), where a = q1a + j (a = 0, . . . , q2  1, j =
0, . . . , q11), i = q1i+j (i = 0, . . . , q31, j = 0, . . . , q11). dene the complex coordinates
z 1 = x2 + ix3, z 2 = x4 + ix5 and set z = 
. the actions of the isometry group

su(2)l  su(2)r along (x2, x3, x4, x5)-directions ( s3) are realized by

z 1 
z 1  z 2
z 2

(gl, gr)  su(2)l  su(2)r : z 7 glzgr.

(3.6)

in particular, let us consider the zq1  su(2)l action generated by gl = 

(  e2i/q1), in other words,



0

0 1 


z 1 7 z 1, z 2 7 1z 2.

(3.7)

as was discussed in several papers (see for example [34]), this su(2)l  su(2)r is no other
than the r-symmetry group of (4,4) scf t2 considered above. therefore, we can expect that
orbifolding3 by this zq1-action breaks the susy of left-mover completely.

under these preparations the quiver projection associated to the orbifold group zq1 should

be dened as

x a a

((a,j+n), (i,j +n)) = x a a
((a,j+n), (i,j +n)) = n  a
 a
  a
((a,j+n), (i,j +n)) =   a

((a,j), (i,j )).

((a,j), (i,j )),

((a,j), (i,j )),

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

3the term orbifolding here is somewhat inaccurate, as was remarked in [20]. we will later discuss this

point carefully, especially relating it with the analysis of multi-particle states.

9

it is not so dicult to check that this projection actually breaks susy down from (4,4)

to (0,4). we have no supercharges of left-mover after this projection is performed. obviously

the central charge c = 6

the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom decrease to 1/q1 by them, and hence we have
q1q5
q1  6q1q2q3 as expected. this evaluation is also consistent
g3 (cid:16) vol(s3)(cid:17) becomes 1/q1 by the

with the brown-hennauxs formula c =
zq1-orbifoldization of s3.

, since

of course, all of the twisted boundary conditions (3.2) are not necessarily compatible with

the conditions of quiver projection (3.8), (3.9), (3.10). to clarify this point it may be useful

to recast further the cp indices as follows;

((a, j), (i, j))  (j, a, i ; n)  (a ; n),

(3.11)

where we set j  j  j  zq1 and n  j. we also introduced the abbreviated notation
a  (j, a, i)  zq1  zq2  zq3. in terms of this notation we can rewrite the conditions of
projections (3.8), (3.9), (3.10) as

x a a

(a ;n+m) = x a a
(a ;n),
(a ;n+m) = m  a
 a
  a
(a ;n+m) =   a

(a ;n).

(3.13)

(3.14)

let s be the subgroup of sq1q5 composed of all the elements of the form (g, m) (g  sq1q2q3,
m  {ma}  (zq1)q1q2q3), which naturally act on the cp indices in the next way;

(g, m) : (a ; n) 7 (g(a) ; n + mg(a)).

(3.15)

namely, we have s  sq1q2q3 (zq1)q1q2q3 (the symbol  standing for the semi-direct product
indicates the relation aba1b1  (zq1)q1q2q3 for a  sq1q2q3, b  (zq1)q1q2q3). notice that
this (zq1)q1q2q3-action is local in the sense that it acts independently for each of the q1q2q3
numbers of cp indices a  (j, a, i). this fact will become important in our later discussions
about multi-particle states.

under thess preparations one can easily nd that only the twisted sectors associated to
g  s are compatible with the quiver projection. (more precisely speaking, s is the maximal
subgroup of sq1q5 such that it has this property.) by the same reason s is the discrete
symmetry group which we should gauge in the quiver projected theory. therefore we

10

should dene the hilbert space for the quiver scf t2 as follows;

h(0,4) = 
mgs

hquiver

g

,

s




(3.16)

g

where hquiver
(g  s) is dened as the fock space of the g-twisted free elds with the quiver
projections (3.12), (3.13), (3.14) imposed. because the constraints (3.12), (3.14) imply the
(zq1)q1q2q3-part of the symmetry group s trivially acts on the right-mover, the hilbert space
of right-mover is the same as that of symq1q2q3(m 4) scf t2. this fact seems consistent with
the observations in previous several works [15, 24]. however, the condition for the left-moving
fermion (3.13) means the (zq1)q1q2q3-action on it is non-trivial. it plays an quite important
role in our later analysis of spectrum.

also in the case of m 4 = k3 we can likewise construct the hilbert space of the quiver
scf t2 at least as long as we regard k3 = t 4/z2, and thus, we do not repeat the detailed
arguments.

4 chiral primaries of quiver (0,4) scf t2

in this section we consider the spectrum of chiral primaries in our quiver (0,4) scf t2.

in general the chiral primaries in the (0,4) theory is obtained from the 1/4 bps states in

the (4,4) theory (only the right-moving susy are preserved). however, the analyses in the

present paper are performed only at the symmetric orbifold point in the moduli space, which

is essentially a free cft, and all the 1/4 bps states at this point are not always stable under

marginal deformations.

to clarify this point, remember that the analysis for the case m 4 = k3 given in [7] counts

only the 1/4 bps states contributing to the elliptic genus, which is an index invariant under
marginal deformations of cft. more recently the similar analysis for m 4 = t 4 based on the

new susy index was given in [8]. their results imply that all the stable 1/4 bps states
q1q5
contributing to these indices with suciently small r-charges (below the bound

4

)

type or the multi-particle states, (later we clarify the precise meanings of the single particle

11

and the multi-paritcle types) and this aspect is consistent with the kk spectrum of sugra
on ads3  s3.

in fact, there are many 1/4 bps states which do not contribute to the elliptic genus (in

the case m 4 = t 4/z2 = k3) in our orbifold hilbert space (3.3). for example,

(a;n) 1/2|0i  |0i,
(a;n) 1/2+
++
(a;n)1/2(a;n) 1/2  +
+(a;n) 1/2(a;n) 1/2|0i  |0i

x(a;n)
x(a;n) n++
x(a;n)

(a;n) 1/2+(a;n) 1/2o|0i  |0i,

(4.1)

are indeed 1/4 bps states (and dene chiral primaries in the (0,4)-theory, since they survive
after the quiver projection), but they do not appear in the expansion of elliptic genus4. since

we should count only the chiral primaries in (0,4) theory which are stable under deformations

of moduli, it is reasonable to consider the quiver projection only on the stable bps states in

the sense of the (4,4) theory, that is, the bps states contributing to the indices mentioned

above.

there may be a subtlety in this argument, since we do not directly consider some index

which is invariant under marginal deformations as (0,4) scf t2. to obtain a rigid under-

standing of spectrum, we will have to carry out a detailed analysis based on such an index,

and to this aim we may perhaps need to study thoroughly the modular property of our (0,4)

model.

it is beyond the scope of this paper, and we would like to discuss this problem

elsewhere.

in any case we shall assume the validity of the above arguments and go on the analysis of

the chiral primaries. under this assumption we only have to look for the candidates of the
stable (0,4) chiral primaries of the single particle type among the su(1, 1|2)l-descendants of
(4,4) chiral primaries, instead of searching for them in the total (0,4) hilbert space (3.16).

this claim is based on the observations with respect to the stable 1/4 bps states in the (4,4)

theory given in [7, 8] we mentioned above. we believe the spectrum given in the present

paper is valid at least on the generic points on the moduli space, and it is enough for the

purpose of checking the correspondence between the kk spectrum of the 5d sugra in bulk

and the chiral primaries of the boundary theory.

4in fact, in [6], the structures of the 1/4 bps states which have h = 1, j = 0, h  j = arbitrary, and can
contribute to the elliptic genus are completely examined. the bps states considered here (4.1) do not belong

to this list.

4.1 spectrum of single particles : untwisted sector

let us rst consider the untwisted sector in the case m 4 = t 4. as was already explained,

the (4,4) hilbert space in the untwisted sector is dened by imposing sq1q5-invariance on the
fock space of the free bosons and fermions x a a

(ai),  a

(ai),   a

(ai).

(ai), x a a

the chiral primary states are dened as follows;

ln|i = ln|i = 0

|i = g+a
|i = ga

(n  1),
|i = 0 (r   1
2 ),
|i = 0 (r  1
2),

r

(4.2)

which corresponds to the short representations of su(1, 1|2)lsu(1, 1|2)r. by this denition
we inevitably have

l0|i = j 3

0|i, l0|i = j 3

0|i.

(4.3)

so, we can characterize the chiral primary states by the two quantum numbers (j, j) - spins
of the two su(2)-currents j , j  .

as is well-known, the chiral primary elds, which corresponds to the chiral primary states

by the standard operator-state correspondence in unitary cf t2, composes a ring by means

of the simple operator products that has no singularity. this ring is called chiral ring, and

from the viewpoints of ads3/cf t2-duality the generators of chiral ring are identied with

the single particle states [30] (see also [6]). so, let us call them the chiral primaries of single

particle type, and call the other operators in chiral ring the multi-particle type.

by taking the sq1q5-invariance into account, we can explicitly construct all of the chiral

13

primaries of single paritcle type in the untwisted sector;

needless to say, these correspond to the cohomology ring of t 4.

at this stage, by perfoming the quiver projection (3.8), (3.9), (3.10) (or (3.12), (3.13),
(3.14)) and imposing the s-invariance, we can immediately obtain the (0,4) chiral primaries
in the untwisted sector. the most non-trivial part of this procedure is the requirement of the
(zq1)q1q2q3-invariance. this invariance has no meaning for the right-mover, since it is trivially
satised because of (3.8), (3.10). but, taking acount of the condition for  a (3.9), we nd
that only the states which are su(2)l-neutral (modulo zq1) survives when the (zq1)q1q2q3-
invariance are imposed. in this way we can obtain the following chiral primaries of the (0,4)

the analysis for the case of m 4 = k3 is also easy. since we now deal with only the bps
states which are stable under marginal deformations, we may simply regard as k3 = t 4/z2.
the constraint of z2-invariance kills the odd cohomologies. hence, in (4.5) only the states

it should be remarked that in the orbifold t 4/z2, we further have the z2-twisted sectors

which correspond to the blow-up modes of 16 xed points.

in fact we must take account

of them to recover the full cohomology of k3. however, because all the contributions from

these twisted sectors are (1, 1)-cohomologies, we get no chiral primaries from these sectors

(the su(2)l-modules for them do not include neutral states). of course, this is not the

case when we deal with the twisted sectors of symmetric orbifold at the same time. we will

later observe how the chiral primaries corresponding to these extra (1, 1)-forms appear in the

twisted sectors of symmetric orbifold.

15

4.2 spectrum of single particles : twisted sectors

the analysis for the twisted sectors is more complicated than that for the untwisted sector.

as we observed before, we can suppose that each twisted sector of the symmetric orbifold

corresponds to a young tableau (n1, . . . , nl), and this is decomposed into a set of zni-twisted

sectors, each of which can describe a single-particle state with a large value of r-charge (see

for example [30]).

since we are here concerned about single particle states, we only have to learn how to

describe the zp-twisted sector which corresponds to the blow-up modes of one of the orbifold
singularities such that x a a
(ap1ip1). it is known that this can be elegantly
but somewhat abstractedly described on some fock space [35]. namely, one can prepare

(a0i0) =    = x a a

the bosonic and fermionic oscillators (in ramond sector) associated to all the even and odd
cohomology elements of m 4 respectively. the oscillators of the type 1() (  h(m 4))
correspond to the untwisted sector and those of the type p() describe the zp-twisted
sector. although this description has many excellences, it may be more useful for our purpose

to describe concretely the chiral primaries in terms of the -model variables themselves.

we must introduce the zp-twisted string or the long stirng with length p to describe
this sector5. we label the objects in this sector by the index a  [(a0i0), . . . , (ap1ip1)],
ai = 0, . . . , q1  1, ii = 0, . . . , q5  1, such that (aiii) 6= (ajij) for i 6= j. the long string
coordinates for this sector (dened on the world-sheet 0    2 which is rescaled from the
p-times one 0    2p) is given as follows ( means each eld x a a,  a,   a);

a() = (arir)(p  2r),  2r

these variables x a a

can produce the superconformal currents of the central charge

c = 6 in the same way as the untwisted sector (3.1). however, the condition of zp-invariance
which should be imposed on the physical hilbert space leaves us only the modes n  pz for the
bosons and the ramond fermions, and the modes n  p(cid:18)1
+ z(cid:19) for the ns femions. by this

these generate the n = 4 sca with c = 6p. the anomaly term in the expression of ln
essentially corresponds to the schwarzian derivative of the conformal mapping z 7 zp).
observing these denitions (4.7), we can nd that the ns vacuum |0,ai of zp-twisted
sector (corresponding to the twist eld which creates a cut on the world-sheet by the state-

operator correspondence) should possess the following properties;

out that we must ll the ns vacuum with all the fermionic oscillators + a

as we showed in the previous section, in the quiver projected theory only the g  s twisted
sectors are possible. furthermore, according to our assumption, we only have to consider the
projection on the su(1, 1|2)l-descendants of (4,4) chiral primaries. these lead to the fact
that we only have to deal with the twisted sectors of the type; a  [(a0i0), . . . , (ap1ip1)] 
[(a0; n0), . . . , (ap1; np1)], where ai  zq1  zq2  zq3, ni  zq1 and, among other things,
ai 6= aj (i 6= j) holds.

let us next discuss the (zq1)q1q2q3-invariance. let m  {ma}  (zq1)q1q2q3, and we dene

the action of (zq1)q1q2q3 on the cp indices of twisted sectors as follws;

m(a)( (1, m)(a)) = h(a0; n0 + ma0), . . . , (ap1; np1 + map1)i ,

(4.19)

where a  [(a0; n0), . . . , (ap1; np1)] as above. this acts trivially on x a a
a
on  a

{ a (s)

in a non-trivial manner. to see it explicitly, it is easier to consider the twisted elds

in the simplest example such that ma0 =    = map1 = m, this reduces to

and we also obtain for the ns vacuum |0,ai;

recall that, when p is odd, |0,ai is su(2)l-neutral, but it has an extra su(2)l-charge 
2
for the cases with even p. the conditions (4.21), (4.22) again imply that only the states
possessing the 2j 3

0 -invariance survive after performing the quiver projection.

in summary the chiral primaries of the twisted sectors in (0,4) theory can be constructed

by the following procedures:

 first, we should consider all the (single particle) chiral primaries in the twisted sectors
of the forms; a = [(a0; n0), . . . , (ap1; np1)], ai 6= aj (i 6= j), which are essentially the
twisted sectors in symq1q2q3(m 4)-scf t2 (not in symq1q5(m 4)).

 second, consider su(1, 1|2)l-module over each of them, and pick up the primary states

such that

2j 3

0|i = |i,

(4.23)

which are the desired chiral primary states in our (0,4)-theory.

since we already know the explicit forms of chiral primaries of (4,4)-theory, it is straight-

forward to write down those for (0,4)-theory according to the above prescription. how-

ever, to avoid unessential complexity, we here only present the spectrum of degeneracy

of them with certain quantum numbers. they correspond to the short representations of
sl(2, r)l  su(1, 1|2)r, and we express each of them by (j; s), where

3

j
0|i(
( l0 

l0|i) = j|i
l0)|i = s|i

(r-charge)

(spin)

(4.24)

in the same way as in sugra. moreover, we express the space of sl(2, r)l  su(1, 1|2)r
irreps. in which lowest component is a boson (fermion) by h(+)

scft (h()

scft) as before.

here we give a comment before we exhibit the spectrum of chiral primaries. by the above
q1k
prescription we should take acount of not only the states with j 3
2
(k  z0). however, the states possessing non-zero j 3
0 -charges correspond to very massive
modes in string theory. in fact, in the original ads3  s2-geometry this charge is identied
with the winding along x5-direction (in our t-dualized framework, the kk momentum along

0 = 0 but also with j 3

0 =

the taub-nut circle), and hence the states with this winding are much heavier than the kk
excitations on s3 (we are now assuming these winding modes have the masses of the extent
of planck mass, and the kk excitations on s3 have the masses 
means these states are negligible in the region where sugra is valid.

1
l2 << m 2

planck.), which

20

notice also that our quiver scf t2 describes the branes at the xed point of the orb-
ifold c2/zq1, which is the decompactication limit of the taub-nut space. so, the stringy
heavy states just mentioned become lighter under this orbifold limit. the existence of these
extra states with non-zero j 3

0 -charges in our quiver scf t2 does not mean a failure of the

ads3/cf t2-correspondence.

therefore, we here only present the spectra of the light chiral primaries with vanishing

j 3
0 -charges, which should be compared with the results of sugra. we will give the complete
spectra including non-zero j 3

0 -charges in appendix, since they have rather involved forms.

by including the contributions from all of the untwisted and twisted sectors, we can obtain

the following spectrum for m 4 = t 4 (we set d  q1q2q3 again);

it is worth mentioning that the r-charge in this spectrum has upper bound 
is because the length of maximally twisted string becomes d  q1q2q3 (not q1q5) after
performing the quiver projection.

let us now turn to the studies for m 4 = k3. as in the previous discussions in the

untwisted sector, we regard as k3 = t 4/z2.

for the untwisted sector in the sense of z2-orbifold, we need to make little change in the
above results for m 4 = t 4. the requirement of z2-invariance simply kills the odd cohomolo-
gies of t 4, and we obtain the contributions from the (4, 4) chiral primaries of the following
types; |(0,0), (p  1)i, |(2,0), (p  1)i, |(0,2), (p  1)i, |(2,2), (p  1)i and also the four series
of the type |(1,1), (p  1)i.

21

to get the complete spectrum we must also make the twisted sectors of z2-orbifold join
in our game. there are 16 twisted sectors corresponding to each xed points of t 4/z2. we
here only focus on one of them, because all of them have the same algebraic structure. at

the same time we take the zp-twisted sector in the sense of the symmetric orbifold.

we have the next mode expansions for the bosonic and fermionic oscillators; a a

(4.27)

in these expressions the extra zero-point energies and r-charges assigned to the ns vacuua

have their origins in these twisted mode expansions. the superconformal currents in this
twisted sector (that is, the twisted in the meaning of both t 4/z2 and the symmetric

orbifold) are also dened as before (4.7), and they give us only one chiral primary state for
each sector, which has the form |(1,1), (p  1)i;
|(1,1), (p  1)i = xa

(4.30)

of course, there are 16 independent such states corresponding to each twisted sectors of
t 4/z2, and they compensate the missing cohomologies of symq1q5(k3). thus we can get
the 20 sequences of the form |(1,1), (p  1)i by including also the 4 contributions from the
untwisted sector.

the next step is the same as that in the case of t 4. we can take the quiver projection

for this twisted sector and can obtain the spectrum which is modded out by 2j 3

0 . gathering

the contributions from all the sectors, we can lastly obtain the next spectrum for k3;

to end this subsection we present a comparison with the results of sugra given in the

previous section. by comparing the results (2.7), (2.8) and (4.25), (4.31), we can notice that

both are equivalent except the following slight dierences:

first, we now have the upper bound for r-charges, which is essentially the one rst

remarked in [30] (stringy exclusion principle). this dierence is not problematic at all, as
far as we work in the suciently large d  q1q2q3 assumed in the maldacena conjecture.

the second dierence is owing to the existence of the chiral primaries |(0,2), (0)i, |(2,0), (0)i
in the (4,4) theory. they correspond to the degrees of freedom which essentially exists only

on the boundary (called singleton) [24, 6]. thus we have no contradiction even if we cannot

nd them in the bulk theory.

in this way we can conclude that the spectrum of chiral primaries of our quiver scf t2 is
consistent with that of the sugra in the ads3  s2-geometry at least for the single particle
states. we must further study the multi-particle states to claim the complete agreement

between them. the next subsection will devote to this subject.

23

4.3 discussions about multi-paritcle states

in the previous subsection we have shown that our quiver scf t2 can produce the spectrum
of single particle states which is consistent with that of sugra on ads3  s2. the essential
part of our discussion was that the quiver projection works on the hilbert space as moding
out by 2j 3

0 . at this point one might ask the followin questions:

is the quiver projection truly needed? why cant we dene the hilbert space of the boundary
0|i = |i on the hilbert space of (4,4)

(0,4) scf t2 by directly imposing the constraints 2j 3
scf t2 on symq1q5(m 4)?

the answer to the rst question is yes, and we can answer to the second question as

follows: one of the evidences for us to need the quiver projection is given by evaluating the
degrees of freedom. if we naively mode out by 2j 3

0 to dene the (0,4) theory (to get a more

suitable candidate of the (0,4) theory, one should further incorporate the twisted sectors of

this orbifoldization to ensure the modular invariance), we will obtain the (0,4) scf t2 with

the same central charge c = 6q1q5 as that of (4,4) theory. but we want the scf t2 with the

1/q1 times degrees of freedom. as was already seen, the quiver projection actually yields the

(0,4) scf t2 with the central charge c =

6q1q5

q1  6q1q2q3.

the second reason why we need to consider the quiver projection is more crucial and has

a deep relationship to the analysis of the multi-particle states. roughly speaking, in order to

be consistent with the spectrum of sugra, the multi-particle states in the boundary scf t2
should have the structure  o1o2   |0i, where oi denotes some descendant of the chiral
primary of single particle type. as was already mentioned, in [7, 8] it is shown that, in the
(4,4) scf t2 on symq1q5(m 4), general bps states which contribute to the invariant index
(elliptic genus for k3, the index given in [8] for t 4) should have indeed such forms, if their

q1q5 + 1

q1q5

. in other words the correspondence of the chiral
r-charges are less than
primaries between the ads3  s3-sugra and the boundary (4,4) scf t2 are satisfactory in
the level of multi-particle states as far as taking the large q1q5-limit.



4

4

now, we rst try to dene the hilbert space of the (0,4) theory, which we express by
h(0,4) in order to distinguish it from h(0,4) (3.16) dened by the quiver projection, by simply
imposing the constraints 2j 3
0|i = |i on the hilbert space of (4,4) theory h(4,4) (here,
we overlook the problem about the central charge we already mentioned.) as we observed

24

before, the h(0,4) so dened includes all the single particle states with correct quantum
numbers. but, how about the multi-particles? if we admit the complete agreement between
the spectrum of (4,4) scf t2 and the ads3  s3-sugra, and adopt h(0,4) as the hilbert
space of (0,4)-theory, we will obtain the following general forms of the bps states of (0,4)

scf t2;

|i = o1o2   |0i,

[2j 3

0 , oi} = rioi, xi

ri  q1z,

(4.32)

where oi denotes the 1/4 bps observables of the single particle type in the sense of (4,4)
susy, and the reader should read [ , } as the (anti-)commutator for the bosonic (fermionic)
eld oi. the important point is that each ri need not be a multiple of q1, although |i must
be zq1-invariant. such |i is of course a multi-particle states in the sense of the (4,4) theory,
but generally not in the (0,4) theory, because the constituents oi may not belong to the
hilbert space h(0,4).

on the other hand, the hilbert space of multi-particle states in sugra should be dend

by taking the (symmetric or anti-symmetric) tensor products of single particle states. this
fact brings us the result that the sugra on ads3  s3/zq1 should include only the multi-
particle states of the following type;

|i = o1o2   |0i,

[2j 3

0 , oi} = rioi,

(ri  q1z).

(4.33)

clearly the states with the form (4.33) merely spans the subspace of that for (4.32). we thus

face the existence of many missing states, if we adopt the simple prescription of orbifoldization
by 2j 3
0 !

next let us observe how we can resolve this inconsistency by considering the quiver projec-

tion. we should notice that each of single-paricle operators has the next cp index structure;

oi = xa(i) oi, a(i), where a(i)  h(a(i)

0 ; n(i)

0 ), . . . (a(i)

pi1; n(i)

pi1)i labels one of the zpi-twisted sec-

tor. (if pi = 1, one should understand it as the untwisted sector, of course.) the general

multi-particles in the (4,4) theory have the forms;

|i = o1o2   |0i  

xa(1) o1, a(1)


xa(2) o2, a(2)


   |0i.

(4.34)

the quiver projection again brings us the requirements of the (zq1)q1q2q3-invariance with
respect to the cp indices. especially, we can take an element m  {ma} of (zq1)q1q2q3 such
that m(i)
. it is the most important to notice that we

0 =    = m(i)

pi1 = m(i), where m(i)

r  ma(i)

r

25

can choose these m(i)  zq1 independently for each i, because of the locality of the (zq1)q1q2q3-
symmetry. therefore, according to the discussions given in the previous subsections, we nd
that the 2j 3
0 -invariance are separately imposed on each of the single particle components oi,
in contrast to the usual orbifoldization of cft. in other words, h(0,4) only includes the bps
states possessing the forms (4.33), although h(0,4) also includes those of the forms (4.32).

in this way we can conclude that the quiver projection does reproduce the consistent

spectrum of multi-particles (4.33). we can also rephrase: the orbifoldization of bulk sugra

does not correspond to the orbifoldization of the boundary cft, rather correspond to the

quiver projection of it!

5 summary and comments

in this paper we have proposed a candidate for the suitable boundary scf t2 which is
dual to the sugra on ads3  s2  m 6 (m 6 = t 6, t 2  k3) by making use of the quiver
techniques. we presented a detailed analysis on the chiral primaries, including all of the

twisted sectors of symmetric orbifolds, and obtained the spectrum which is consistent with

sugra in the maldacena limit.

it is plausible and may not be so surprising that the quiver projection on the single particle

states leads to the simple moding out prescription by 2j 3

0 . but for the multi-particle states,

this procedure of orbifolding leads to the wrong results. we must carefully consider the quiver

projection, not the orbifolding, to get a consistent spectrum of the multi-particles.

however, because of just this fact that our quiver scf t2 is not an usual orbifold scf t2,

it will become a subtle problem whether it has actually the modular invariance. needless to

say, the modular invariance is an important consistency condition of cf t2 on torus, and in

addition, in the thermodynamical studies on the ads3-gravity including some btz black-holes

[40], it is expected to yield a very powerful tool [4, 30]. the check of modular invariance for

the quiver scf t2 seems a challenging and an important problem, and we hope to investigate

this problem in future.

one of the natural generalizaitons of the studies in this paper is the works for m 6 = cy3.

although the analyses for the completely general cy3 seem very dicult, it might be possible

26

to apply our formulation at least to some elliptic cy3. we can reduce by the ber-wise

t-duality the original system of m5 to the one composed of a d3 wrapped around a susy

2-cycle in the base manifold of the elliptic bration, located at the singularity of an orbifold.

it may be also interesting to compare our quiver scf t2 with the space-time cft

[12] given in the string theoretical approach along the line of [18].

it is worth remarking

that the quiver projection can completely reproduce the (0,4) version of the stringy ex-

clusion principle of [30] (that is, the unitarity bound of the arbitrary chiral primary is

j  q1q2q3 

q1q5

q1 !, and that for the single particle is j 

q1q2q3

2

. the latter was already

mentioned, and the former is easily shown by counting the degrees of freedom and by taking

acount of the fermi statistics.). whether this bound can be also explained in the framework

of [12] is an important test. to answer this question completely, we may need rst to study

carefully the unitarity bound for the (4,4) space-time cft [18], maybe based on the discus-

sions given in [41]. to this aim the approach from the matrix string theory [42] may become

more ecient than that of the old fashioned string on ads3 back-ground. some studies

along this line will be presented in [37].

a complete spectra of the chiral primaries in quiver

here we give the complete spectra of the chiral primaries including the general states such
0|i = kq1|i (k  z0). to this aim it is convenient to introduce the symbol (j; s)k

that 2j 3
