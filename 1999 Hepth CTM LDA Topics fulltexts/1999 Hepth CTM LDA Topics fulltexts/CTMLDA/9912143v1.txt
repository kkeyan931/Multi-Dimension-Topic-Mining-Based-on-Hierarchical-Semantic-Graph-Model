we show that sl(2; c)/su (2) model which had been re-
cently proposed to describe the behaviour of the local den-
sities of states at the plateau transition in integer quantum
hall eect, has logarithmic operators. they unusual proper-
ties are studied in this letter.

in our previous paper [1] we have discussed a prob-
lem of plateau transition in integer quantum hall ef-
fect. we have provided evidence to suggest that the
correlation functions of the local densities of states
(dos) at the critical point may be obtained from the
critical sl(2; c)/su (2) wess-zumino-novikov-witten
(wznw) model, in which the level k = (k + 2) (k > 0)
is xed by the known scaling dimensions. the action of
this model is given by

s0 =

(k + 2)

4

z d2x(cid:2)4  + e2 (cid:3)

(1)

this model has numerous applications in eld theory in-
cluding the theory of disorder (see, for example [2] and
references therein). among unconventional features dis-
played by this model is the presence of non-trivial pri-
mary elds with zero scaling dimension. these operators
are likely to play very important role in the applications.
thus, in [1] we have suggested that to study correlation
functions of local dos one has to consider the eective
action

s = s0 + z d2x 0(x),

(2)

where 0 is a non-trivial primary eld of scaling dimen-
sion zero. we have argued that in order to obtain the
consistent results for the correlation functions at the crit-
ical point, one has to execute the   0 limit. this
includes expansion in powers of  keeping only the rst
non-vanishing term. in this procedure the two-point cor-
relation function of the qth powers of the local dos is
expressed as the limit of the four-point correlation func-
tion:

q(r1)q(r2) =
hq(r1)q(r2)0(r3)0(r4)i

lim

|r3|0,|r4|

(3)

at any nite  its presence in the eective action gener-
ates the scale l  1/2.

in this paper we show that the theory possesses an-
other eld with zero scaling dimension which presence
in the eective action does not violate the conformal in-
variance. a similar example has already been consid-
ered in [1] (see appendix 6) where it was shown that at
k = 2 kinetic the energy perturbation model does not
violate conformal invariance of model (1)0). the corre-
sponding operator has the operator product expansion
(ope) 0(z)0(0) = 0(0), and hence has zero norm.
such ope is essential for preservation of the conformal
invariance of the theory.

there is a degeneracy in the present problem: besides
the nontrivial operator with dimension zero there is al-
ways a unity operator. one can think that the pair of
degenerate operators form the logarithmic pair [3].
in
such a pair one of the operators always has zero norm
[4]:

hc(x)d(y)i= hc(y)d(x)i =

c

(x  y)2c

hd(x)d(y)i=

1

(x  y)2c

hc(x)c(y)i= 0

(2c ln(x  y) + d)

(4)

where in our case  = 0

the purpose of this letter is to investigate the proper-
ties of zero-dimensionmal operators sl(2, r) model and
to see if there are logarithmic operators in the theory.
let us note that logarithmic operators in sl(2, r) model
have been discussed before (see for example [5]) but not
particularly zero dimensional ones.

primary elds of model (1) are tensors from the rep-
resentations of the sl(2, r) group. each representation
is labeled by its angular momentum j. the conformal
weights are

hj = j(j + 1)/k

(5)

the multi-point correlation function of primary elds be-
longing to representations with angular momentum ja
is given by the following knizhnik-zamolodchikov (kz)
equation [6], [8]:

where we use the overbar to denote disorder averaging,
and use the angular brakets to denote correlation func-
tions of our eld theory. suggesting this procedure we
have assumed that 0 was a relevant operator such that

here the parameter y parametrizes the sl(2, r) group
variables and one gets the following representation for
the sl(2, r) generators

let us note that this equation is invariant under trans-
formation z  1  z, t  1  t, which means that for
any solution f (z, t) there is another one f (1  z, 1  t).
one particularly simple solution for the holomorphic

part is given by

in this parametrization a matrix operator k,k is mapped
on a function of complex variable (y, y) (we omit here
the dependence on spatial coordiantes z and z) as

(j),(j)(y, y) = xk,k

yj+k yj+k(j),(j)

let us discuss now the case when all operators have

j = 0. the equation (6) for j = 0 becomes

we shall concentrate on holomorphic dependence on
z and y only, the restoration of z and y dependence
is straightforward. let us study rst of all the case
of n = 2. the two-point functions g2(z, y) =<
0(z, y)0(0, 0) > which obeys the equation

n(cid:19) < j1 (1)...jn (n) >= 0,

l = 1, 0, +1 (1) = (z1, y1), ..., (n) = (zn, yn) (11)

one gets for jn = 0 very simple constraints

g(1...n ) = 0,

l = 1, 0, +1

(12)

and from l = 0 constraint we see that y 
0 which means that 
function is a constant.

y g2(z, y) =
z g2(z, y) = 0 and the two-point

for n = 4 the ward identities (12) and similar vira-
soro l1, l0 constraints preserve the invariance of cor-
relation functions under projective transformations in z
and y planes. hence the four point function g(1, ...4)
depends only on the anharmonic ratios z and t where

z =

z32z41
z31z42

,

t =

y32y41
y31y42

and eq.(9) for g(1, ...4) = f (z, t) is simplied by the
projective nvariance

(15)

g(1, ...4) = a ln(z/tk) + b ln[(z  1)/(t  1)k]

(14)

we see that we have logarithmic singularities in this
correlation function. moreover, besides logarithms of z
we also have logarithms of t. the former ones are due
to the jordan cell structure of the virasoro algebra [3]
whereas the latter ones are due to the jordan cell struc-
ture of the kac-moody algebra [6], [7]. hence expansion
(8) must be modied

one can choose constants a and b to get two types of
invariant solutions: for b = 0 we get the solution which
changes sign under permutation z, t  1/z.1/t which cor-
responds to the permutation 1  2 or 3  4:

hf1(1)f1(2)f2(3)f2(4)i = ln(cid:12)(cid:12)z/tk(cid:12)(cid:12)

choosing a = 2b we get the solution with is invariant
under z, t  z1, t1:

(16)

hb1(1)b1(2)b2(3)b2(4)i =

ln(cid:20)

|z|

|1  z|2(cid:21)  ln(cid:20)

|t|k

|1  t|2k(cid:21)

(17)

it is easy to check that there are no solutions invariant un-
der permutations of all operators. therefore we are lead
to the conclusion that there are two types of fermionic
elds fa and two types of bosonic elds ba ( a = 1, 2)
such that their 4-point correlation functions are given by
eqs.(16,17). hence there is a hidden su (2) symmetry in
this problem.

from (16) we derive the following operator product

expansion (ope) for f1, f2 :

fa(z + z, y + y)fb(z, y) = ab < f f >

+ab [ln |z|cz(z, y) + ln |y|cy(z, y) + d(z, y) + ...] (18)

where the ab structures are dictated by su (2) symmetry
and dots stand for terms vanishing at   0. from this
ope one can see that the fusion of f1 and f2 generates
a logarithmic triad cz, cy, d:

hcz(1)d(2)i = 1,

hcacbi = 0,
hcy(1)d(2)i = k,
hd(y, z)d(0, 0)i = 2 ln |yk/z|

(19)

let us note that this triad actually represents two
pairs: the virasoro logarithmic pair [3] cz, d which is
mixed under the conformal transformation z  z as

d  d  ln cz, cz  cz

(20)

and the kac-moody logarithmic pair [6] [7] cy, d which
is mixed under the sl(2,r) transformation y  y gen-
erated by t3 = y(/y):

d  d  ln cy, cy  cy

(21)

for the bosonic operators one gets the following ope

from 4-point function (17):

ba(z + z, y + y)bb(z, y) = (2ab  1)
 [ln |z|cz(z, y) + ln |y|cy(z, y) + d(z, y) + ...]

(22)

in this paper we would like to concentrate on the
fermionic sector only. the role of bosonic elds ba and
they relation to the operators 0 used in [1] will be dis-
cussed elsewhere.

it is logical to suggest that hcai = 0. therefore the
two-point correlation function of fa is constant which is
consistent with the result derived from eq.(10). to get a
non-trivial coordinate dependence one has to dene the
new two-point function putting in it a vacuum insertion
of d:

hf1(1)f2(2)d()i = ln |z12/yk

12|

(23)

we also can study the 6-point functions, in which case
the answer can be presented as an antisymmetrized prod-
uct of 2-point functions and 4-point functions :

hf1(1)f1(2)f1(3)f2(4)f2(5)f2(6)i =
+hf1(1)f2(6)ihf1(2)f1(3)f2(4)f2(5)i
hf1(1)f2(5)ihf1(2)f1(3)f2(4)f2(6)i
hf1(1)f2(4)ihf1(2)f1(3)f2(6)f2(5)i
hf1(2)f2(6)ihf1(1)f1(3)f2(4)f2(5)i
+hf1(2)f2(5)ihf1(1)f1(3)f2(4)f2(6)i
+hf1(2)f2(4)ihf1(1)f1(3)f2(6)f2(5)i
hf1(3)f2(6)ihf1(2)f1(1)f2(4)f2(5)i
+hf1(3)f2(5)ihf1(2)f1(1)f2(4)f2(6)i
+hf1(3)f2(4)ihf1(2)f1(1)f2(6)f2(5)i

using the fact that the two-point functions hf1(i)f2(j)i
is a constant (it may be even zero, but we do not know
this with certainty and this is not important) and the
four-point function is given by (16)

 k ln(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

ybcyad

yacybd(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(25)

hf1(a)f1(b)f2(c)f2(d)i = ln(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

zbczad

zaczbd(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

we can easily see that the six-point function is identically
zero. the proof of this is the following. we can see that
each pair of indices a and b where the rst one is 1, 2, 3
and the second one is 4, 5, 6 appears precisely in four
terms in (24). for example the pair 3, 4 appears in a rst,
second, fourth and fth four-point correlation functions,

which means that the terms ln |z34| and ln |y34| will enter
four times. a simple inspection of (24) shows that two
times they enter with sign plus and two times with sign
minus and the total contribution is zero.
in the same
way we can check each pair of indices, for example the
pair 1, 5 enters fourth, six, seventh and ninth correlation
functions and again the total contribution is zero, etc.

thus we see that the the six-point correlation function
it is not dicult to generalize these solutions
is zero.
for general n = 4m and n = 4m + 2.
in the rst
case one has to decompose n points in groups of four
in all possible ways and take a symmetrized (bosons) or
antisymmetrized (fermions) sum of products of solutions
(14). in the second case we multiply this by two-point
correlation functions < f1f2 >, but since they are con-
stants it is essentially the same procedure. one can show
that for fermions all these correlation functions are identi-
cally zero. we have checked it explicitly for 8-point func-
tions. the structure of antisymmetrization in a higher
dimensional case is such that each pair appears in an even
number of four-dimensional correlation functions half of
which have negative signs.

it is most remarkable that all higher-order fermionic
correlation functions vanish. since the c, d-operators of
the triad can be generated via fusions of the fermions
(18), this result means that all higher-order correlation
functions of the logarithmic elds vanish. not only three-
point functions are trivial

hca cb cci = 0,

hca cb di = 0,
hca d di = 0, hd d di = 0

(26)

where indices a, b, c, for zero norm operators c means y
or z, but also all four-point functions are

(24)

hcccci = 0,

hcccdi = 0,
hcdddi = 0,

hccddi = 0,
hddddi = 0,

(27)

from here we can dedudce that ope of c and d may

have only the c operator (besides unity operator i):

ca cb = fabccc
ca d = < cad > i + fabcb
d d = < dd > i + faca

(28)

this is precisely what one needs to be able to truncate
an expansion in superpositions of c and d operators.
adding a new c or d term inside a correlation function
does not change its scaling behaviour; only the rst two
c and d operators matter, not the next ones. thus we
conclude that model (1) remains conformally invariant
when one adds to the action the term

z d2x : f1f2 :

(29)

it is quite a challenge to fully understand the phys-
ical meaning of the operators discussed in this paper.

the reason is that our knowledge of relationship between
observables in the quantum hall problem and elds of
model (1) is very limited. the only thing we can be
sure about is that such operators are important. this
certainty is supported by results obtained for other dis-
ordered systems (see [9], [10]), where operators with zero
scaling dimensions also play very important role. hope-
fully, better understanding of mathematical structure of
these theories will help to get an insight into their phys-
ical meaning. it is also possible that these operators will
play an important role in other physical problems where
sl(2.r) wznw model is important, for example, for
gravitational dressing of exactly integrable models and
logarithmic operators in string theory [5].
