abstract

we address the question of ads/cft correspondence in the case of the 3-point function
< o4o4o8 >. o4 and o8 are particular primary states represented by trf 2 + ... and
trf 4 + ... operators in n = 4 sym theory and dilaton  and massive xed scalar  in
d = 5 supergravity. while the value of < o4o4o8 > computed in large n weakly coupled
sym theory is non-vanishing, the d = 5 action of type iib supergravity compactied on
s5 does not contain  coupling and thus the corresponding correlator seems to vanish
on the ads5 side. this is in obvious contradiction with various arguments suggesting
non-renormalization of 2- and 3-point functions of states from short multiplets and im-
plying agreement between the supergravity and sym expressions for them. we propose
a natural resolution of this paradox which emphasizes the 10-dimensional nature of the
correspondence. the basic idea is to treat the constant mode of the dilaton as a part of
the full s5 kaluza-klein family of dilaton modes. this leads to a non-zero result for the
< o4o4o8 > correlator on the supergravity side.

1. introduction

recent studies of 2- and 3-point functions of operators in short multiplets of n = 4
super yang-mills theory in the context of ads/cft correspondence [1,2,3] (see [4] for
a review) suggest that they are not renormalized in large n limit [5,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,12].1
since the supergravity correlator is interpreted as the large n strong coupling sym re-
sult, this implies that the exact sym expressions for the large n limit of the 2- and
3-point correlators of such operators should not contain non-trivial functions of t hooft
coupling (the coordinate dependence of the n  3 correlators is xed uniquely by confor-
mal invariance). this conclusion is supported by explicit sym perturbative calculations
[15,16,17,18], general arguments based on n = 4 superspace [17] or u (1)y symmetry
[19] (or non-renormalization of anomalies [20]). however, one easily nds an apparent
contradiction.

consider the following su (n ) n = 4 sym operators

o4 = tr(f f ) + ... ,

(1.1)

o8 =

3
2

str[f 4 

1
4

(f 2)2] + ...

= tr(f f ff +

1
2

f f ff 

1
4

f f ff 

1
8

f ff f) + ... , (1.2)

where dots stand for scalar and spinor terms which are required by n = 4 supersymmetry
and str is the symmetrized trace of su (n ) generators as matrices in the fundamental
representation. o4 and o8 are supersymmetric descendants of chiral primary operators
tr(xx) and tr(xxxx), respectively,2

o4 = (q4 + q4)trx 2 ,

o8 = q4 q4trx 4 .

(1.3)

for all the operators trx n the precise agreement between the (weighted) 3-point cor-
relators computed in the large n weakly coupled sym and the ads5 supergravity was
demonstrated in [10], so it seems natural to expect the same for their supersymmetry
descendants.

1 for other papers on correlators in the ads/cft correspondence see [13,14] and references

in [4].

2 the precise denition for these chiral primary operators is [10]: c i

i1 ik tr(x i1    x ik ), where
c i is a totally symmetric traceless rank k tensor of so(6) and x i are scalars of n = 4 sym
theory. the action of supercharges in trx 2 and trx 4 is indicated only schematically. in particular,
in o8 one needs to specify the ordering of qs and qs to resolve the associated total derivative
ambiguity.

1

using the ads/cft correspondence recipe, one nds  either from the supermultiplet
considerations [3,21] or from the structure of the born-infeld action for a d3-brane in a
curved background [22]  that on the supergravity side o4 corresponds to the 5-d dilaton
 [23,24], while o8 corresponds to the xed scalar  [25].3 the latter enters the d = 10
einstein-frame metric as

ds2

10e = e 10

3 (x)g5mn(x)dxmdxn + e2(x)d2

5 .

(1.4)

the specic powers of e in the metric are needed to decouple  from the 5-d graviton;
this ansatz generalizes to non-linear level the graviton mode decomposition considered in
[27] where this massive (m2 = 32
r2 ) singlet scalar  was identied with the zero mode (s5
independent part) of the trace of the perturbation of the metric of s5. note that the zero
mode  does not mix with the 4-form potential, while higher kaluza-klein modes do [27]. it
is the lowest-mass member of the kk family of scalars with masses m2 = (k+4)(k+8)
, k =
0, 1, ..., and belongs to a separate massive d = 5 supermultiplet interacting with the
d = 5, n = 8 supergravity multiplet. dimensionally reducing the dilaton-graviton sector
of type iib supergravity action to 5 dimensions, one easily nds [28] that the action does not
contain  coupling (in agreement with the possibility to perform the so-called consistent
truncation of the full d = 5 theory to the d = 5 gauged supergravity subsector). this
implies that on the ads supergravity side

r2

< o4o4o8 >ads = 0.

however, the explicit computation of < o4o4o8 > in the sym theory performed below to
the leading order in large n expansion yields a non-vanishing result for this correlator.4

one then faces the following three options:
(i) there may be some subtlety in applying the nonrenormalization theorem for the
3-point functions of chiral primary operators trx n to their supersymmetry descendants
and the correlator < o4o4o8 > may actually depend on gauge coupling in such a way
that it vanishes in the limit   g2
may be a subtlety in the denition of the o8 operator, e.g., it may contain also 1

(ii) the non-renormalization statement for the sym correlator is correct but there
n trf 2trf 2

ymn  .5

3 a relation between xed scalars and f 4-type operators was earlier mentioned in [26] in the

case of the d5+d1 system.

4 that this correlator of the bosonic gauge-theory parts of o4 and o8 computed in the abelian

theory limit is non-vanishing was already observed in the rst paper in [25].

5 one possibility could be that the n = 4 supersymmetric expression for the 3-point function
for the whole multiplet contains several tensor structures. however, this seems to be excluded by

the arguments in [16,17].

2

admixture6 (with various possible lorentz contractions of the two f 2 factors). that would
change the result for the three-point function on the sym side and may make it zero.7
however, this suggestion seems to be in contradiction with arguments based on n = 4
supersymmetry [16,29].

(iii) there may be subtleties in the supergravity calculation. the supergravity result
may turn out to be non-vanishing and in agreement with the non-vanishing large n sym
result.

in this paper we shall propose a natural resolution of this paradox based on the third
option. the key observation is the following. suppose that there was some non-vanishing
two dilaton  xed scalar coupling in the d = 5 action. then the resulting 3-point function
computed from supergravity according to the rules of [3] would actually be divergent. this
can be seen from the general expression for the 3-point function of the scalar elds in the
(euclidean) ads5 space found in [6]. if the scalar action is

s = z d5xg5(cid:20) 1

it follows from (1.8) that whenever the dimensions of the operators s satisfy the relation
(or any of its two permutations)

the coecient a1 develops a pole. this is precisely what we encounter in the case of the
 interaction: since m2
r2 one has 1 = 2 = 4, 3 = 8, i.e.
3 = 1 + 2. the nal result is thus undened: a product of a zero and a divergence.9
our proposal is that in such special cases one should use a special regularization
prescription in computing the supergravity expressions. one should eectively turn on a
little bit of s5 kk momentum for the dilaton. then (i) the dilaton will get an innitesimal
mass , i.e. the dimension of o4 will be shifted from 4 to 4 + , thus regularizing (1.8), and
(ii) the action will get a small coupling term . as a result, the dependence on  will
cancel out in the nal expression in (1.7) (  1
 =1) and we will obtain a nite result for
< o4o4o8 >. this procedure essentially amounts to an analytic continuation that treats
the s5-independent zero mode  as an integral part of the whole family of s5 kk modes
of the 10-d dilaton eld.

equivalently, we suggest that the ads/cft correspondence should be dened for the
whole kk families of modes on the supergravity side, i.e. one is to compute, e.g., the
supergravity  correlator as a limit of the correlator for the two massive kk modes
of the dilaton (with equal masses m2
, k = 0, 1, 2, ...) and . a non-zero kk
quantum number k implies that now k = 4 + k (the corresponding sym operator is
o4+k  str(f 2x k+...)) and thus the -function factor in (1.7) [ 1
2 (1+23)] is simply
(k). at the same time, the coupling constant  between  and the two kk dilaton
modes happens to be non-vanishing for k 6= 0 and is proportional to
2k1(k+1)(k+2) . as a
result, the product of 123 and a1 in (1.7) is well-dened and nite ( k(k) = (1 + k))
for all k, including the case of k = 0.

k = k(k+4)

r2

k(k+4)

a similar prescription should be applied in all cases where the anomalous dimensions of
the three operators in the correlation function satisfy the relation (1.9). with a hindsight,
the suggested regularization procedure is actually implicit in the examples discussed in [10],
where the 3-point functions < trx ktrx ktrx 2k > (k = 2, 3, ...) were shown to be nite and
equal to their large n (free-eld) sym counterparts. there the poles in the supergravity
amplitudes (1.7),(1.8) were similarly cancelled by zeros in the cubic lagrangian coupling
derived from the kk reduction of the 10-d supergravity action.10

close parallel with the case of the trx n 3-point functions and the supersymmetry
relations between the corresponding operators on the sym side (1.3) leave little doubt
that the precise numerical ads/cft correspondence should then be found also in the
<o4o4>1/2<o8o8>1/2 . to check this explicitly
present case of the normalized correlator
one is to compare the nite numerical coecient obtained using our prescription on the

<o4o4o8>

9 if one regularizes the resulting ir divergence (e.g., by shifting the position of the boundary)

the nal result will be zero because of the vanishing of the bulk interaction constant.

10 the observation about cancellation between poles and zeroes for special combinations of

dimensions of the three operators in [10] was also made in ref. [30].

supergravity side with the large n sym result. since the comparison is done for the

normalized correlator, one needs to know also the sym expressions for < o4o4 > and
< o8o8 >. while the sym computation of < o4o4o8 > (discussed below) does not
depend on the scalar and fermionic terms in the n = 4 supersymmetric completion of
the f 4 operator (1.2), to nd < o8o8 > one needs rst to determine the full structure
of o8. this will be done in [31] where we will present the full expression for the n = 4
super-invariant o8 in terms of n = 1 and n = 2 superelds and compute < o8o8 > using
o-shell supereld formalism.

the plan of this paper is the following. in section 2 we shall present the sym calcu-
lation for the correlator < o4o4o8 > in the leading large n (xed  = g2
ymn ) approx-
imation. in section 3 we shall determine the supergravity expressions for the correlators

< o4o4o8 > using the analytic continuation in kk momentum prescription outlined
above. section 4 will contain some concluding remarks. in appendix a we shall discuss an

attempt to determine the normalization of the o8 operator from its coupling to the xed
scalar  in the born-infeld d3-brane probe action.

2. gauge theory calculation of < o4o4o8 >

in this section we shall compute < o4o4o8 > correlator in large n sym theory and
demonstrate that it is non-vanishing. as already mentioned above, one is able to nd

the precise expression for < o4o4o8 > (at separated points, i.e. modulo contact terms)
without knowing the detailed structure of the supersymmetric completion of f 4 terms in
(1.2). it is easy to understand either from the action of supercharges on the chiral primary
eld (1.3) (see, e.g., [12]) or from the (n  2) supereld expressions [21] that the scalar
and fermionic terms in o4 are of the equations of motion form11

o4 = tr(f 2 + x2x +    + ...) .

(2.1)

11 here we are ignoring interaction (commutator [x, x], [, x] dependent [12]) terms in o4

since they produce terms of higher order in  in the correlators (which altogether should cancel

out in the cases where there is a non-renormalization theorem). since the dilaton should be

related to gauge coupling constant, one expects that the dilaton operator should be proportional

to the sym lagrangian, up to a total derivative term. the n = 2 supersymmetry implies that
the quadratic scalar term should have the form tr(xd2x), which is dierent from the standard

kinetic term by a total derivative.

5

contracted with other elds in the correlators these terms give rise only to contact con-
tributions proportional to delta functions (which are eld-redenition dependent and are
omitted in cft correlation functions).12

as a result, the scalar and fermionic terms in o4 and o8 are irrelevant for the compu-
tation of < o4(x)o4(0) > and < o4(x)o4(y)o8(0) > which can therefore be done simply
in the pure ym theory. the correlator < o8(x)o8(0) > does, however, receive non-trivial
scalar and spinor contributions, i.e. is dierent from the pure ym result [31].

we shall take the su (n ) yang-mills lagrangian in the form

all correlators will be found in the free theory limit, i.e. ignoring all contributions which
are sub-leading at large n and small . hence the eld strength matrices in (1.1) and
(1.2) do not contain the interaction term, i.e. are simply f = a   a, and the
12 this explains, in particular, the agreement between the result obtained using the dilatonic
f 2 operator that follows from the bi action [23,24] (in the einstein frame the bi action gives
ef 2 +(x)2+..., i.e. scalars and fermions do not couple to ) and the form of the corresponding

n = 2 superinvariant that has the structure (2.1). the scalar and fermionic terms are important,

however, in most of other relevant cases: for example, the stress tensor operator that couples to

the 4-d graviton contains non-trivial scalar and fermionic terms [24] (see also [12]).

(3.1)

in what follows we shall concentrate on the dilaton  xed scalar correlators, but the case
where the dilaton is replaced by the rr scalar c (and the sym operator trf 2 is replaced
by trf f ) is very similar. the background ads5  s5 metric (which is an extremum of
(3.1) [32]) is

ds2

10 = r2[

1
z2 (dz2 + dxdx) + d2

5] ,

r4 = 4gsn 2 .

(3.2)

in what follows we shall set the radius r to be 1. to dimensionally reduce to d = 5,
we use the ansatz (1.4) for the 10-d einstein frame metric. the relevant part of the type
iib supergravity action reduced to 5 dimensions for the zero modes of the dilaton and the
metric is

14 in the case of abelian gauge theory these correlators were computed in [25]. the numerical
coecients in the correlators found in the abelian theory and the large n non-abelian theory are

dierent.

(3.4)

this action does not contain  coupling (in particular,  term)  this is a consequence
of the fact that the dilaton does not couple to both r and (f5)2 in (3.1).

as was already explained in the introduction, our main suggestion is that to establish
a correspondence between the sym and the supergravity expressions for the < o4o4o8 >
correlator one should regularize the dimensional reduction procedure. one should rst
assume that  has some small dependence on s5 coordinates, leading to an innitesimal
5-d dilaton mass term and an innitesimal  coupling, and take the corresponding small
parameter to zero only after the computation of the  correlator. the meaning of this
prescription is that treating the zero mode of the dilaton on the same footing as higher
kk modes resolves the ambiguity in the denition of the  correlator and leads to a
nite value for its overall numerical coecient.

let us start with decomposing  in terms of spherical harmonics on s5

(y, x) = xi

y i (y)i(x) .

(3.5)

we shall follow the notation of [10] and consider s5 as embedded in a euclidean space r6.
yi1    yik , where yi (i = 1, ..., 6)
the spherical harmonics y i are dened by y i = c i
are the cartesian coordinates of the embedding r6 space (yiyi = 1) and c i
i1...ik are totally
symmetric traceless tensors of rank k.

i1...ik

the i = 0 term in (3.5) 0(x)  (x) is the 5-dimensional dilaton while i (x) are
higher kk modes of the d = 10 dilaton. the dimensionally reduced form of the dilaton
part of the action (3.1) is found to be

l2 = e 10

ss , where gss  e2 is the s5 part of the metric in (1.4).

since for i = 0 one has k = 0 and thus vanishing b(k), we conclude once again
that there is no coupling between  and the zero mode of the dilaton. instead of taking
k = 0 directly, one may formally set k =  and take the limit   0 only at the end of
the calculation of correlation functions. as follows from (3.9), this prescription generates
both a small mass for the 5-d dilaton and a coupling between the dilaton and ,

(3.11)

introducing the couplings between the ads5 boundary values of the 5-d elds  and  and
the corresponding n = 4 sym f 2 and f 4 operators (1.1),(1.2) as in [2,3] we get

z d4x(cid:2) a4 o4 (x) + a8 o8 (x)(cid:3) ,

(3.12)

where a4 and a8 are some normalization constants.

we learn from (3.3) and (3.12) that the operators o4 and o8 have the following

dimensions (m2  0)

8 = 2 + 4 + 32 = 8 .

(3.13)

following [2,3] and using the expressions for the 2- and 3-point functions in [6] we nd
from (3.3),(3.12) the following supergravity predictions for the correlators involving o4
and o8 (see eqs. (1.6)(1.8))

there is an extra factor of 2 in (3.16) coming from the fact that there are two dilaton eld
legs in the  coupling (3.11). in (3.16) we have used that for m2  0, ( m2

the resulting expression for the  correlation function is thus nite: the zero in the

let us note in passing that there is also no  coupling in (3.3), i.e.

< o4(x)o8(y)o8(0) >= 0 .

(3.17)

since the dimensions of the three operators here do not satisfy (1.9), in contrast to the case
of < o4(x)o4(y)o8(0) > the expression (1.8) for this correlator is well-dened and there is
no ambiguity. the vanishing of < o4(x)o8(y)o8(0) > in (3.17) can be deduced from the
argument based on u (1)y charge conservation, see [19,17]. from the supergravity point of
view, this u (1) is part of sl(2, r) which is a classical symmetry of type iib supergravity.
the dilaton transforms non-trivially under this group, while  is inert being part of the
einstein-frame metric. thus the coupling like  is forbidden in the classical supergravity
lagrangian.

since the supergravity expressions (3.14)(3.16) depend on the normalization con-
stants appearing in (3.12), the direct comparison with sym result (2.7) is not possible.
the weighted three-point function does not depend on the absolute normalization,

< o4(x)o4(y)o8(0) >=

nr 16

,

where o4 and o8 are rescaled o4 and o8 satisfying

< o4(x)o4(0) >=

1
x8

,

< o8(x)o8(0) >=

1
x16

.

(3.18)

(3.19)

to compare (3.18) with the sym result we need the expression for < o8o8 > in sym
theory which requires a detailed separate computation and will be presented in [31]. here
we note only that the value of < o8o8 > in sym theory which would lead to the agreement
with (3.18) is

< o8(x)o8(0) >=

105  36

8

x16 .

(3.20)

not surprisingly, this expression is dierent from the pure gauge theory part (2.8) of the
full sym correlator.

one heuristic way to x the values of the normalization constants a4 and a8 in (3.12)
is to derive (3.12) from the bi action for a d3-brane propagating in a curved background.
as shown in appendix this leads to

a4 =

n
4

,

a8 =

10n 2

,

(3.21)

where  = g2
ymn = 4gsn . the leading large n term in (2.6) is in perfect agreement with
the supergravity expression (3.14) with a4 given by the bi normalization in (3.21) (this

10

agreement is essentially the one originally found in [23,24,2]). if we use a8 from (3.21) in
(3.15) we nd that the supergravity expression for < o8(x)o8(0) > is

< o8(x)o8(0) >bi=

84  814

and from (3.16) we get

< o4(x)o4(y)o8(0) >bi=

(3.22)

(3.23)

the numerical coecient in (3.23) is dierent from the one in (2.7) by factor of 3

agreement may be related to ambiguities in using the bi action for xing the normalization
of operators beyond the leading second-derivative terms (see appendix).

4. concluding remarks

what follows from our proposal is that though some of the couplings in the s5 com-
pactied 5-d (supergravity + kk multiplets) action may appear as missing they are actu-
ally hidden and must be taken into account in establishing the ads/cft correspondence.
this may carry an important message about how the ads/cft correspondence is actually
working. the 10-d picture with non-zero kk momentum seems to be more fundamental
than the 5-d one. this is after all what the original precise conjecture [1] about the duality
of ten-dimensional string on ads5  s5 and n = 4 sym theory is implying.
on the supergravity/string side the 5-d elds appear as kk modes of d = 10 elds
upon compactication on s5. the families of 5-d elds originating from a single type iib
supergravity eld should denitely remember their common 10-dimensional origin. at
the same time, this 10-dimensional origin of the corresponding composite operators on
the sym side is quite obscure. the ads5  s5 string  sym correspondence suggests
that there may exist a 10-dimensional reformulation of n = 4 sym theory where these
operators are somehow unied in kk families.

one of our motivations for trying to get a detailed understanding of how the ads/cft
correspondence works at the level of 3-point functions is to shed some light on the factor-
ization properties of much more complicated 4-point correlators. in the previous discus-
sions of the supergravity expression for the 4-point function of the dilatonic o4 operator
[28,33,34,35], the contribution of the scalar  exchange to the four-dilaton amplitude was
not included. this may be justied by noting that although the 3-point amplitudes (1.7)
are divergent for the operators satisfying (1.9), the exchange amplitude contributing to the
4-point function < o1 o1 o2 o2 > with the exchanged state corresponding to the op-
erator o3 is actually nite [36,30]. naively, one may conclude that the -exchange contri-
bution to the four-dilaton amplitude is indeed zero. this seems to provide an example when

11

the existence of a non-vanishing three-point function (< o4o4o8 >) does not imply the
presence of the corresponding factorization contribution to the 4-point (< o4o4o4o4 >)
correlator.

the story may be more intricate. in line with our proposal for the 3-point function <
o4o4o8 > we suggest that the supergravity expression for the 4-dilaton amplitude should
be dened as a k  0 limit of the amplitude < o4+ko4+ko4+ko4+k > for four massive
(m2
) dilaton modes. this amplitude receives contributions from both graviton
and xed scalar exchanges. it may happen that when the correlator < o4o4o4o4 > is
dened in this way, its factorization will become more transparent (cf. [33,36,30,35]).

appendix a. normalizations of o4 and o8 operators from born-infeld action

here we describe an attempt to x normalizations in (3.12) by starting with a born-
infeld action.16 the born-infeld lagrangian for (a collection of) d3-branes in curved
background has the form:

l = t3 strqdet(g + e 

2 f ) + wz  terms ,

where

f = 2f ,

t3 =

1

(2)3gs2

.

(a.1)

(a.2)

we take the background metric einstein-frame metric as a combination of (3.2) and (1.4):

ds2 = r2[e 10

3  dz2 + dxdx

z2

+ e2d2

5] ,

r4 = 2 ,

 = 4gsn = g2

ymn .

16 similar approach of xing normalizations from bi action was used in [24,37].

(a.6)

the normalization of o8 derived in this way is only heuristic and should be treated with
caution.

indeed, this argument may look suspicious for several reasons. first,  already couples
to scalars x at the second derivative level but (x)2 cannot be part of the o8 operator.
also,  interacts dierently with f 4 and (x)4 terms, in contradiction with the fact that
they must be parts of the same super-invariant. the scalar partners of the gauge eld
couple to  at quartic order as e4(x)4, which leads to the normalization coecient
dierent from the one in (a.6)  since the coecient of  10

3 is replaced by 2, we get

a
8 =

2n 2
32

.

(a.7)

remarkably, this is precisely the coecient one needs for the correspondence between the
supergravity and sym expressions for the 3-point functions (see eqs. (3.16) and (2.7)).
however, due to the ambiguities mentioned above it seems hard at the moment to make
this argument convincing.

in general, the bi action [38,39,40] summarizes the low-energy limit of scattering am-
plitudes of massless open string modes in at space. its direct curved-space generalization
correctly accounts for certain zero-momentum limits of the disc amplitudes with few closed
string vertex operator insertions (see, e.g., [41]). one should keep in mind, however, that
the standard bi action does not include terms with derivatives of the vector eld strength,
higher than the rst derivative of the scalar (coordinate) elds and terms with derivatives

17 in taking the boundary limit the factor z4 produces a cuto factor which should multiply f 4

on dimensional grounds.

13

of the closed string elds. as a result, there may be a clash with manifest (linearly real-
ized) n  4 supersymmetry: the manifestly supersymmetric extensions of the structures
appearing in the expansion of the bosonic bi action may involve higher derivatives; elim-
ination of such higher-derivative terms via integration by parts may produce terms with
derivatives of the background supergravity elds, i.e. terms which are not included in the
standard bi action. in particular, one should not be surprised if one does not nd the
correct bosonic (scalar) parts of the corresponding superinvariants from the expansion of
the bi action.
