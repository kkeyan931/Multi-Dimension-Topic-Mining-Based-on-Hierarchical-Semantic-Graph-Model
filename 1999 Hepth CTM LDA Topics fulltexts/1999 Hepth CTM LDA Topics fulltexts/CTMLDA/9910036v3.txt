abstract: we present a general analysis of the thermodynamics of spinning black
p-branes of string and m-theory. this is carried out both for the asymptotically-at
and near-horizon case, with emphasis on the latter. in particular, we use the con-
jectured correspondence between the near-horizon brane solutions and eld theories
with 16 supercharges in various dimensions to describe the thermodynamic behavior
of these eld theories in the presence of voltages under the r-symmetry. boundaries
of stability are computed for all spinning branes both in the grand canonical and
canonical ensemble, and the eect of multiple angular momenta is considered. a
recently proposed regularization of the eld theory is used to compute the corre-
sponding boundaries of stability at weak coupling. for the d2, d3, d4, m2 and
m5-branes the critical values of /t in the weak and strong coupling limit are re-
markably close. finally, we also show that for the spinning d3-brane the tree level
r4 correction supports the conjecture of a smooth interpolating function between
the free energy at weak and strong coupling.

1. introduction and conclusion

in the early 1970s, two important discoveries were made which have played a domi-
nant role in theoretical physics ever since. the rst discovery, by bekenstein [1] and
hawking [2], was that four-dimensional black holes have thermodynamic properties
due to hawking radiation. thus, by studying thermodynamics of black holes one
probes the nature of quantum gravity. in the framework of string and m-theory, this
discovery has been one of the main motivations to consider the thermodynamics of
black p-branes [3, 4, 5]. the second discovery, by t hooft [6], was that non-abelian
gauge theories simplify in the t hooft limit. in this limit the planar diagrams dom-
inate and the theories thus become more tractable.

more recently, it has become clear that these two discoveries are in fact con-
nected through the conjectured correspondence between the near-horizon limit of
brane solutions in string/m-theory and certain quantum eld theories in the large n
limit [7, 8]. as a consequence of this correspondence, studying the thermodynamic
properties of black p-branes not only probes quantum gravity, but can in addition
provide information about the thermodynamics of quantum eld theories in the large
n limit.

in particular, for the non-dilatonic branes (d3,m2,m5) the near-horizon limit of
the supergravity solutions has been conjectured [7] to be dual to a certain limit of
the corresponding conformal eld theories (see also refs. [9, 10] for an elaboration
of the conjecture at the level of the partition function and correlation functions).
in these ads/cft correspondences, the near-horizon background geometry is of
the form adsp+2  sd1 and the dual eld theories are conformal. moreover, for the
more general dilatonic branes of type ii string theory preserving 16 supersymmetries,
similar duality relations have also been obtained [8], which may be characterized
more generally as domain wall/qft correspondences [11, 12]. see ref.
[13] for a
comprehensive review and refs.
[14, 15, 16] for some introductory lectures on the
ads/cft correspondence and eld theories in the large n limit.

a common feature of these dualities between near-horizon backgrounds and eld
theories, is that the supergravity black p-brane solution exhibits an so(d) isometry
(where d = d p 1 is the dimension of the transverse space) which manifests itself
as the r-symmetry of the dual eld theory. as a consequence, by considering black
p-brane solutions that rotate in the transverse space, we expect on the one hand to
learn more about the eld theory side, and on the other hand, be able to perform
further non-trivial tests of the duality conjectures that include the dependence on this
r-symmetry group. in particular, as will be reviewed below, the thermodynamics
on the two sides provides a useful starting point for such a comparison.

the rst construction of spinning branes solutions, rotating in the transverse
space, can be found in refs.
[17, 18, 19, 20] from which, in principle the most
general black p-brane solution [21] can be derived by oxidization. also, various

2

spinning brane solutions [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] have recently been constructed
and employed with the purpose to provide extra dimensionfull parameters in the
decoupling of the unwanted kk modes in the context of obtaining qcd in various
dimensions via the ads/cft correspondence [29]. other examples of spinning brane
solutions include the spinning ns5-brane [30] and rotating kaluza klein black holes
[31]. spinning branes have also been used [32] in the study of d-brane probes [33,
34, 35]. many aspects of the case in which the rotation does not lie in the transverse
space [36, 37, 38, 39, 40], generally referred to as the kerr-ads type, have also been
considered in view of the ads/cft correspondence but will not be considered in
this paper.

it is interesting in its own right to study the thermodynamic properties of black
p-branes and rotating versions thereof, since this may teach us more about black
brane physics. in particular, the near-horizon solution is thermodynamically much
better behaved than the asymptotically-at solution, which along with its relevance
to a certain limit of the dual eld theories, makes it very interesting to study the
thermodynamics in this case. for the non-dilatonic branes the study of the thermo-
dynamic stability has been initiated1 in a number of recent papers [46, 47, 48, 49, 50].
the stability for the d3-brane with one non-zero angular momentum was addressed
in [46] followed by an analysis both in the grand canonical and canonical ensemble
for all non-dilatonic branes [47]. it was found that these two ensembles are not equiv-
alent. an analysis of the critical behavior near these boundaries was also performed
and shown to obey scaling laws of statistical physics. the case of multiple angular
momenta was considered in ref. [50] for both ensembles.

furthermore, in order to compare with the eld theories, a regularization method
[46, 50] has been proposed and used in order to compare the stability behavior
obtained from the supergravity solution with that of the corresponding eld theory
in the weakly coupled limit. the angular momenta take values in the isometry group
of the sphere, and hence map onto the r-charges in the dual eld theory. therefore,
the angular velocities on the brane correspond in the eld theory to voltages under
the r-symmetry. in the presence of these voltages, a regularization is required, since
for massless bosons with non-zero r-charge negative thermal occupation numbers
occur. for the d3-brane case, it was found that the regulated eld theory analysis
predicts a similar upper bound on the angular momentum (or r-charge) density as
obtained from the near-horizon brane solution. the critical exponents obtained from
the supergravity solution are, however, not reproduced, though a mean eld theory
analysis has been suggested to cure this discrepancy. finally, ref. [50] also presents
evidence for localization of angular momentum on the brane outside the region of
stability, and the occurrence of a rst order phase transition.

1other aspects of the thermodynamics in relation to the ads/cft correspondence and holog-

raphy were studied e.g. in refs. [41, 42, 43, 44, 45].

the comparison of boundaries of stability in the two dual sides is one way to
obtain evidence and predictions of the correspondence between near-horizon brane
solutions and eld theories. another route, that also uses thermodynamic quantities
is consideration of the free energy which, in the non-rotating case, has been computed
from the euclidean action by a suitable regularization method [51, 29]. for non-
rotating d3, m2 and m5-branes it has been conjectured that there exists a smooth
interpolating function connecting the two limits [52]. in particular for the d3-brane
one nds that for the near-horizon ads5  s5 limit the free energy diers by a
factor 3/4 from the weakly coupled n=4 sym expression. since the former limit
corresponds to the strong t hooft coupling limit, it can be envisaged that higher
derivative string corrections on the supergravity modify this result in such a way that
minus the free energy increases towards the weak coupling limit. this conjecture was
tested [52, 53] by computing the correction to the free energy arising from the tree
level r4 term in the type iib eective action, and shown to be in agreement. in this
spirit, the study of such corrections is also interesting to perform in the presence of
rotation.

in this paper, we will address various issues related to the developments described
above, with emphasis on a general treatment for all black p-branes that are 1/2
bps solutions of string and m-theory in the extremal and non-rotating limit. this
includes the m2 and m5-branes of m-theory and the d and ns-branes of string
theory. we will rst write down the general asymptotically-at solution of these
spinning black p-brane in d dimensions. since the transverse space is d = d  p  1
dimensional, these spinning solutions are characterized by a set of angular momenta
li, i = 1 . . . n where n = rank(so(d)), along with the non-extremality parameter r0
and another parameter  related to the charge. using standard methods of black hole
thermodynamics we compute the relevant thermodynamic quantities of the general
solution and show that the conventional smarr formula is obeyed. (see section 2).

our main interest, however, will be in the near-horizon limit of these spinning
branes, which we will also compute in generality. the corresponding thermodynamics
that results in this limit will also be obtained. in the near-horizon limit the charge
and chemical potential become constant and are not thermodynamic parameters
anymore, so that the thermodynamic quantities are given in terms of the n + 1
supergravity parameters (r0, li). in particular, we derive and check a modied smarr
law for the near-horizon background which is due to a dierent scaling of the solution
as compared to the asymptotically-at case. one also nds a simple formula for
the gibbs free energy for any near-horizon spinning black p-brane solution with d
transverse dimensions

in a low angular momentum expansion, we rewrite this expression in terms of the
intensive thermodynamic quantities, the temperature t and the angular velocities

i. for comparison, we then use the correspondence with eld theory in the large n
limit (and appropriate limit of the t hooft coupling limit in the case of d-branes),
to write this free energy in terms of the eld theory variables. (see section 3).

we proceed with presenting a general analysis of the boundaries of stability
in both the grand canonical ensemble (with thermodynamic variables (t, i)) and
the canonical ensemble (with thermodynamic variables (t, ji)) of the near-horizon
spinning branes. while there is a one-to-one correspondence between the n + 1
supergravity variables and the extensive quantities (s, ji), the map to the intensive
ones (t, i) or the mixed combination (t, ji) involves a non-invertible function, a
fact which is crucial to the stability analysis. we will show in particular that for
general d, the two ensembles are not equivalent and that increasing the number of
equal-valued angular momenta enlarges the stable region2. for one non-zero angular
momentum we nd, in the grand canonical ensemble, that the region of stability (for
d  5) is determined by the condition

j r d  2

(1.2)

so that there is an upper bound on the amount of angular momentum the brane
can carry in order to be stable. put another way, at a critical value of the angular
momentum density (which equals the r-charge density in the dual eld theory)
a phase transition occurs. the supergravity description also determines an upper
bound on the angular velocity,

t

p(d  2)(d  4)

which is saturated at the critical value of the angular momentum. as a byproduct
of the analysis we obtain an exact expression of the gibbs free energy in terms of
(t, ) for all branes in the case of one non-zero angular momentum3. we will also
comment on the nature of the instability and discuss the setup to be solved in order
to determine whether there is some region of parameter space in which phase mixing
is thermodynamically favored, so that the angular momentum localizes on the brane.
finally, we give a uniform treatment of the critical exponents for all spinning branes
in both ensembles and show that all of these are 1/2, a value which satises scaling
laws in statistical physics. (see section 4).

an important question is to what extent do we observe the above stability phe-
nomena in the large n limit of the dual eld theory, also at weak coupling. to this

2except for the cases d = 8, 9, which have no stability boundary for one non-zero angular

momentum.

3the case d = 4, which can be seen from (1.1) to be special since the free energy vanishes, will
be treated separately. in this case, the temperature and angular velocity are not independent, so
that the phase diagram is degenerate.

5

[46], we obtain in an ideal gas approximation
end, extending the method of ref.
the free energies of the eld theories for the case of the m-branes and the d-branes
of type ii string theory. we review and extend the interpolation conjecture, stating
that the free energy smoothly interpolates between the weak and strong coupling
limit. the free energies in the weakly coupled regime enable us to corroborate these
conjectures by computing the boundaries of stability in this regime. the correspond-
ing critical values of the dimensionless quantity /t for the d2, d3, d4, m2 and
m5-branes are remarkably close in the weak and strong coupling limit. (see section
5).

finally, we also test the interpolation conjecture by considering the free energy.
we rst establish that for all near-horizon spinning branes the on-shell euclidean
action reproduces the thermodynamically obtained gibbs free energy (1.1). for the
spinning d3-brane we then calculate, in a weak angular momentum expansion, the
correction to the free energy due to the tree-level r4 term in the type iib eective
action. this order 3/2 correction is positive (in the range of validity) and hence
supports the conjectured existence of a smooth interpolating function between the
free energy in the weak and strong coupling limit. (see section 6).

a number of appendices are included: appendix a gives a general discussion
of (non-rotating) black p-branes, including those that preserve a lower amount of
supersymmetry. we also nd the thermodynamic quantities and smarr formula
for both the asymptotically-at and near-horizon solutions. appendix b reviews
spheroidal coordinates which are relevant for the explicit form of spinning brane
backgrounds. appendix c shows how the euclidean spinning brane solution can
be obtained from the minkowskian solution. appendix d discusses the change of
variables from the supergravity variables to the intensive thermodynamic variables
in a weak angular momentum expansion. finally, appendix e gives various useful
expressions for the polylogarithms which are used in section 5 to compute the free
energies of the weakly coupled eld theories in the presence of voltage under the
r-symmetry.

2. general spinning p-branes

more than forty years after the discovery of the schwarzschild black hole metric, kerr
presented in 1963 the rst metric for a rotating black hole [54]. about twenty years
later, this was generalized to neutral rotating black holes of arbitrary dimensions
in [55]. in [17, 18, 19] these were further generalized to charged rotating black hole
solutions of the low-energy eective action of toroidally compactied string theory. in
[20] the rst spinning brane solutions appeared and recently spinning brane solutions
of type ii string theory and m-theory have been presented in [22, 23, 24, 30, 21].

in this section we consider the general spinning brane solutions of string theory
and m-theory. the general solution is presented in section 2.1 and in section 2.2 we

6

derive the thermodynamic quantities of the general spinning brane solutions.

2.1 the spinning black p-brane solutions

in this section we present the general charged spinning black p-brane solution with
a maximal number of angular momenta for branes of string theory and m-theory.
these solutions have the property that they are 1/2 bps states in the extremal
and non-rotating limit. thus, they include the d- and ns-branes of 10-dimensional
string theory4 and the m-branes of 11-dimensional m-theory, as well as the branes
living in toroidal compactications of these theories. the solutions can be derived
by oxidizing spinning charged black hole solutions in a d p dimensional space-time
[17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 30, 21].

we only write the solutions for electric branes, since the magnetic solutions can
easily be obtained by the standard electromagnetic duality transformation. in our
conventions the coordinate system is taken to be (t, yi, xa), where t is the time, yi,
i = 1 . . . p the spatial world-volume coordinates and xa the transverse coordinates.
the space-time dimension is denoted by d, so that d = d  p  1 is the dimension
of the transverse space. the spinning brane solutions given below are solutions of
the action

where fp+2 is the (p + 2)-form electric eld strength. this action arises as part of
the 10-dimensional string eective action in the einstein frame or the 11-dimensional
supergravity action, and toroidal compactications of these actions5. the value of
a is a characteristic number for each brane, and for branes that are 1/2 bps in the
extremal and non-rotating limit, one has the relation

which can be ignored since these moduli do not aect the background solution and its resulting

branes, including those which preserve less than half of the supersymmetries.

parameters that characterize the solutions are the non-extremality parameter r0 and
a dimensionless parameter , related to the charge. in particular, r0 = 0 corresponds
to the extremal p-brane solution, while  = 0 corresponds to a neutral brane. the
relation of these parameters to the thermodynamic quantities of the solution will be
discussed in section 2.2. we restrict ourselves to the cases for which the transverse
dimensions lie in the range 3  d  9 so that the brane solutions are asymptotically
at.

and we note that the harmonic function h is such that the branes are asymptotically

the physical situation that this solution describes is a charged black p-brane
rotating in the angles 1, 2, ..., n (see appendix b). the rotation is static, meaning
that the points of the p-brane move with time, but that the total set of points of
the brane in the embedding space does not change with time. thus, the solution
describes a spinning charged black p-brane.

2.2 thermodynamics of spinning branes

we proceed with describing some general physical properties of the solution given in
(2.3), (2.4) and (2.5), and the computation of its relevant thermodynamic quantities.
the horizon is at r = rh where rh is the highest root of the equation f(r) = 0,

so that

(2.8)

where ld is dened in (2.7a). on the other hand, the solution of the equation f (r) =
0 with the maximal possible value of r describes the so-called ergosphere, which
coincides with the horizon for special values of the angles  and 1, 2, ..., dn2. it
is useful to nd a coordinate transformation to a system in which these two hyper-
surfaces coincide. to this end we write

t = t ,

i = i  it ,

i = 1 . . . n

(2.9)

with all other coordinates unchanged. thus, we want to nd {i, i = 1 . . . n} so that
(2.10)

in the transformed frame one has

since eq. (2.12) should hold for all angles, we can consider the special choice for
which i = 1 and j6=i = 0. then (2.12) becomes

the new coordinate system dened in (2.9) can be seen as comoving coordinates on
the horizon, i.e. coordinates for which the points on the brane in the embedding
space do not move with time7. from the denition (2.9) it then follows that i is

namics of rotating black holes and that the statistical analysis of rotating black holes is simplied
in this frame.

i is the angular velocity of the black p-brane with respect to the angle i. moreover,
in the new coordinate system the o-diagonal metric component

with norm v 2 = gtt. it then follows from (2.12) that at the horizon this is a null
killing vector.

the new frame (2.9) also enables us to compute the temperature. by construc-
tion, both the metric components gtt and grr are zero for r = rh. as a consequence,
the standard procedure of transforming to euclidean space can be employed to nd
the temperature of the p-brane: first we go to the euclidean signature by a wick
rotation  = it, and reinterpret the path-integral partition function as a partition
function for a statistical system in d  1 dimensions with the temperature t = 1/,
where  is the periodicity of  . this periodicity is determined by avoiding a singu-
larity in space time (see for example [51]). in the case at hand, the euclidean metric
near the horizon can be written as

to avoid a conical singularity we need to require that  is periodic with period 2,
which determines

one can then proceed to calculate the temperature t from (2.20) using the particular
choice of angles  = 
2 , so that 1 = 1 and i6=1 = 0. with this choice, we also have
2

i = 0 for all i and j. after a tedious calculation, one obtains

i = j 2

in fact, it follows8 from (2.8) that d  2  2  0 and hence t  0. for r0 > 0 it
is thus possible to have t = 0 and this in turn denes a boundary on the region of
possible values of (l1, . . . , ln) in units of r0.

besides i and t , the chemical potential

q of a spinning black p-brane are the same as for the non-rotating black p-brane,
since we can measure these physical quantities in the asymptotic region of the space-
time. in the asymptotic region, one can check that the metric (2.3) does not contain
the angular momenta li to leading order in 1/r. to calculate the adm mass m
one can therefore use the prescription given in ref. [57]. the angular momenta ji,
i = 1 . . . n, can be read from the asymptotic expansion of (2.3) using the formula [55]

3. near-horizon limit of general spinning branes

in this section we examine the near-horizon limit of the spinning p-brane solutions
considered in section 2. this provides further insights into the thermodynamics
of black branes. more importantly, this is relevant since according to the corre-
spondence [7, 8] between near-horizon brane solutions and eld theories, this gives
information about the strongly coupled regime of these eld theories in the presence
of non-zero voltages under the r-symmetry.

in section 3.1 we take the near-horizon limit while in section 3.2 we nd the
relevant thermodynamic quantities of the solution. finally, in section 3.3 we discuss
the map between the supergravity solutions and the dual eld theories, obtaining in
particular the free energies of these eld theories.

3.1 the near-horizon solution

to nd the near-horizon solution, one has to take an appropriate limit of the solution
that is specied as follows: we introduce a dimensionfull parameter  and perform
the rescaling

r =

r0 =

where the new quantities on the left hand side are expressed in terms of the old
quantities labelled with a subscript old, and we recall that hold is dened in (2.33).
note that the rescaling in (3.1b) leaves the action (2.1) invariant due to the relation
(2.2). the near-horizon limit is dened as the limit   0 keeping all the new

in particular, (3.1a) implies that in this limit we have

and the functions ld, kd, f , f are as dened before in (2.7), (2.6), since the scale

3.2 thermodynamics in the near-horizon limit

we now turn to the thermodynamics of the near-horizon spinning p-brane solution
(3.2) obtained in the previous subsection. using the rescaling (3.1a) in the expres-
sions (2.28b) and (2.28d) for (t, s) and (i, ji) one nds in the near-horizon limit

from (2.28c) we see that the chemical potential  = 1 and that the charge q is
constant. thus, in the near-horizon limit the chemical potential and the charge are
not anymore thermodynamic parameters.

in appendix a we derive the internal energy of a black p-brane in the near-
horizon limit by dening this energy to be the energy above extremality e = m  q.

since m and q are not aected by the rotation of the brane, it follows from (a.15)
that

(3.12)

15

a remark is in order here for the special case d = 4, which includes the d5 and ns5-
brane in 10 dimensions, since in that case it follows from (3.11) that f = 0. from
(3.12) we observe that since the partial derivatives of f with respect to t and {i} are
nonzero, these variables cannot be independent. thus the phase diagram in terms of
these variables degenerates into a submanifold with at least one dimension less. this
point will be further illustrated in section 4.2 where we discuss the phase diagram
for one non-zero angular momentum. for the non-rotating case, one immediately
deduces from (3.4a) that the temperature must be constant for d = 4.

since the gibbs free energy is properly given in terms of the intensive quantities
t and {i} we need to write the expression (3.11) in terms of these variables9. the
change of variables from the supergravity variables (r0,{li}) to these thermodynamic
variables is given in appendix d in a low angular momentum expansion

as will be explained in section 3.3, f is the free energy for the eld theory
living on the brane in the strongly coupled large n limit. in section 5 we compare
this expression with the corresponding expressions in the weakly coupled eld the-
ory. moreover, in section 6.1 we show that the free energy (3.11) is reproduced by
calculating the (regularized) euclidean action of the solution.

3.3 the dual eld theories

in the remainder of this paper, we will restrict ourselves to the spinning brane solu-
tions of type ii string theory and m-theory. for these p-branes we can map [7, 8] the
near-horizon limit to a dual quantum field theory (qft) with 16 supercharges,
namely the eld theory that lives on the particular p-brane in the low-energy limit.
as explained in refs. [7, 8], in the near-horizon limit the bulk dynamics decouples10
from the eld theory living on the p-brane, so that the supergravity solution in the
near-horizon limit describes the strongly coupled large n limit of the dual qft.

9in section 4.2 we obtain the exact expressions for one non-zero angular momentum.
10with the exception of the d6-brane, as discussed for example in [8].

16

the fact that the branes are spinning, introduces the new thermodynamic pa-
rameters i and ji on the supergravity side which need to be mapped to the eld
theory side, where they are conjectured to correspond to voltage and charge for the
eld theory r-symmetry group. thus, the validity of this correspondence requires
the r-symmetry groups to be so(d), with the charges ji taking values in the car-
tan subgroup so(2)n of so(d) and their legendre transforms corresponding to the
voltages i. in section 5 we analyze the eld theory in the weakly coupled regime
using the r-charge quantum numbers of the massless degrees of freedom.

indeed, for the p-branes with p  6 it has been noted in [8, 11] that the dual
qfts have the correct r-symmetry groups. in particular, in ref.
[8] it was noted
that dp-branes have an iso(1, p)so(d) symmetry in the near-horizon limit, where
so(d) corresponds to the r-symmetry group of the dual eld theory and iso(1, p)
corresponds to the poincare symmetry of the dual eld theory. moreover, in the
dual frame, as considered in ref. [11] (see also [12]) the near-horizon solutions under
consideration can be written as dwp+2  sd1 with a linear dilaton eld, where
dwp+2 is the p + 2 dimensional domain-wall. also in this language, the isometry
group so(d) of sd1 translates into the r-symmetry group of the dual eld theory.
as explained in [8, 12] we can trust the supergravity description of the dual eld
theory, when the string coupling gs  1 and the curvatures of the geometry are
small. this implies in all cases that the number of coincident p-branes n  1. for
the m2- and m5-brane this is the only requirement since there is no string coupling
in 11-dimensional m-theory. for the dp-branes in 10 dimensions one must further
demand that [8]

1  g2

e  n

4

7p ,

g2
e = g2

ymnrp3

(3.15)

e is the eective coupling, g2

where g2
ym the coupling of the yang-mills theory on
the dp-brane and r is the rescaled radial coordinate in the near-horizon limit (the
distance to the d-brane probe) and the higgs expectation value in the dual qft11.
thus, the near-horizon limit describes the dual qft in the large n and strongly
coupled limit. note that the thermodynamic expressions are valid when r is replaced
by rh in eq. (3.15). for larger values of the eective coupling the d1 and d5-brane
ow to the ns1 and ns5-brane respectively, while the self-dual d3-brane ows to
itself [8]. in particular, the ns1-brane description is valid for n 2/3  g2
e  n and
the ns5-brane description for n 2  g2
e (see also refs. [59, 30] for further details on
the type ii ns5-branes).

in view of this correspondence, we can write the gibbs free energy and other
in particular we

thermodynamic quantities in terms of eld theory variables12.

as for the d1 and d5-brane when expressed in terms of  and n. note that the
free energies for the dp-branes with p  4 are negative, while the d5 and ns5-brane
have zero free energy and the d6-brane positive free energy.

in the discussion above, we have chosen to explicitly write down the free energies
in terms of the variables of the dual eld theories, since these expressions will play an
important role below. of course, the same can be done for the other thermodynamic
quantities listed in (3.4) using (3.16), (3.18) and (3.20). note also that for the
special value of  = 1
2(d  2) the temperature vanishes, implying that besides the
usual extremal limit describing zero temperature eld theory, we also have a limit in
which the temperature is zero, accompanied by non-zero r-charges.

4. stability analysis of near-horizon spinning branes

in this section we analyze the critical behaviour of the near-horizon limit of spinning
p-branes, using the thermodynamics obtained in section 3.2. using the mapping
between the supergravity solutions and the dual qfts, as described in section 3.3,
we can nd the critical behaviour for the strongly coupled dual eld theories with
non-zero voltages under the r-symmetry.

section 4.1 presents a general discussion of boundaries of stability in the grand
canonical and canonical ensemble. these two ensembles are then considered in more
detail in sections 4.2 and 4.3 respectively.
in section 4.4 we nally consider the
critical exponents in the two ensembles.

4.1 boundaries of stability

there are two dierent settings in which we can study the stability of near-horizon
spinning branes. in the rst one, to which we refer as the grand canonical ensemble,
we imagine the system to be in equilibrium with a reservoir of temperature t and
angular velocities i. thermodynamic stability then requires negativity of the eigen-
values of the hessian of the gibbs free energy. in particular, a boundary of stability

19

occurs when the determinant of the hessian is zero or innite. in the second one, re-
ferred to below as the canonical ensemble, we have constant angular momenta ji and
a heat reservoir with temperature t . stability in this situation demands positivity
of the heat capacity cj and the boundaries of stability occur when this specic heat
is zero or innite.

in the case at hand, we have a system in which the thermodynamic quantities
are given in terms of the supergravity variables, so that the boundaries of stability
will crucially depend on the change of variables between these two descriptions. we
will therefore repeatedly need the determinants of the jacobians, and we dene dt 
as the determinant (t,1,2,...,n)

(rh ,l1,l2,...,ln) and likewise for dt j , ds and dsj.

in the grand canonical ensemble we need the determinant of the hessian of the

gibbs free energy, which can be written as13

det hes(f ) =

dsj
dt 

(4.1)

so that the zeroes of the two determinants dsj , dt  determine the boundaries of
stability. for completeness and use below we also give the specic heat

c = t(cid:16) s

t(cid:17)1,...,n

= t

ds
dt 

(4.2)

showing that det hes(f ) and c may have dierent zeroes. in the canonical ensem-
ble, on the other hand, we need the specic heat

cj = t(cid:16) s

t(cid:17)j1,...,jn

= t

dsj
dt j

(4.3)

and the boundaries of stability are determined by the determinants dsj and dt j .

in further detail, using the thermodynamic quantities in (3.4) it then follows

that

det hes(f ) = 82(cid:18) vpv (sd1)hd2

the expressions are written for the case of maximal possible number of angular
momenta n = 4, but hold also for n < 4 by setting the appropriate xi = 0. one
observes that, as seen for the free energy in (3.11), the case d = 4 is special since
t  = 0 identically, implying that the coordinates (t,{i}) are not independent.
since sj 6= 0, the boundaries of stability in the two ensembles can thus be
determined as follows: in the grand canonical ensemble a boundary is reached when
t  = 0 and the hessian of the gibbs free energy diverges. in the canonical ensemble
on the other hand, we have a boundary of stability when t j = 0, in which case
the specic heat cj diverges. more precisely, the boundaries of stability are n-
dimensional submanifolds in the (n + 1)-dimensional phase diagram, where one of
these two determinants vanish. in the following subsections we study these conditions
for the special case of m  n equal angular momenta, supplemented with a detailed
discussion for the simplest case of one non-zero angular momentum. for the non-
dilatonic branes this analysis was performed in refs. [46, 47, 50].

it should be remarked that, at rst sight, the analysis shows that we do not have
any rst-order phase transitions, since all rst derivatives of the thermodynamic

potentials are continuous everywhere. the phase transitions are instead second-
order, though this result should be taken with care, since [50] has given evidence
for a rst-order phase transition. we will comment on this possibility in the next
subsection. another general result of the analysis is that the boundaries of stability
are distinct in the two ensembles that we consider, with a larger region of stability in
the canonical ensemble as compared to the grand canonical ensemble, in accordance
with standard thermodynamics.

we emphasize here that although we have phrased the analysis in terms of the
variables (rh , xi), these are in one-to-one correspondence with the thermodynamic
extensive variables (s, ji) through the relations

which follow from (3.4) and (4.6). hence, conditions on xi can be directly translated
into conditions on the ratio ji/s. alternatively, one may rephrase the stability
conditions in terms of the dimensionless ratios

4.2 grand canonical ensemble

we consider the case of m  n equal non-zero angular momentum, so that xi = x =
l2/r2

h, i = 1 . . . m, in which case the relevant quantity t  in (4.5a) simplies to

t  = (d  4)(cid:16)d  2  (d  2  2m)x(cid:17)(1  x)m1

(4.10)

we rst note that for d = 3 (which includes the d6-brane) det hes(f ) is less than
zero for all x, and hence corresponds to an unstable situation. the case d = 4 (which
includes the d5 and ns5-brane), for which t and i, i = 1 . . . n are not independent
will be treated separately at the end of this subsection, so in the following we assume
d  5. in this case, we know that for zero angular momentum, i.e. x = 0, the branes
are stable. we will be concerned only with the rst instability that occurs as x is
increased, which is hence determined by the rst zero of t .

values of  are determined by substitution in (4.13) so that

it is also interesting to examine the behavior of the specic heat c in (4.4b),

for which we need in addition to (4.10),

which follows from (4.5b) and  in (2.23). besides a diverging specic heat at x(m)
we see that c vanishes, on the other hand, for the values

one non-zero angular momentum

in the remainder of this subsection we restrict to the case of one non-zero angular
momentum, which by itself exhibits various interesting physical phenomena. the
stable region is x  xc, with the critical value given by

or using (4.7),

xc  x(1)

c =

j r d  2

(4.18)

(4.19)

the stability requirement thus sets an upper bound on the angular momentum, and
a phase transition occurs at the critical value of the angular momentum density. in
the dual eld theory, this corresponds to a critical value of the r-charge density.
from eqs. (3.4) one can also derive the general formulae

(4.20a)

(4.20b)

it is not dicult to see that at the boundary of stability x = xc where the hessian
diverges, the ratio  is maximized15, so that the supergravity description sets an
upper bound on this quantity,

  c =

xc

1
2

(4.21)

moreover, as easily seen from (4.20a), for each value of  below this maximum
there are two values of x, one corresponding to a stable and the other to an unstable
conguration. in particular the two supergravity descriptions with (rh, x) and (rh, x)
related by

x =

rh = rh x2

(4.22)

give the same values of t , . the phase diagram therefore consists of two sheets, a
stable one and an unstable one.

14note also that for d = 3 the specic heat vanishes at xt = 1.
15as a consequence, one could have determined this boundary of stability by maximizing /t ,

providing an alternative method without having to resort to computing jacobians.

table 4.1: boundaries of stability in the grand canonical ensemble (gce) and canonical
ensemble (ce) for m  n equal non-zero angular momenta. the values in the last column
give zero temperature.

as an illustration consider a process in which one starts with a non-rotating non-
extremal brane at given r0 = rh and turn on the angular momentum l adiabatically,
while keeping the horizon radius constant. when the critical value c is reached
the conguration becomes unstable and for the d3-brane two scenarios have been
proposed [50]: d-brane fragmentation, in which the branes y apart in the transverse
dimension, and phase mixing in which angular momentum localizes on the brane.
the latter possibility will be briey discussed below for the general p-brane. note
also that for vanishing horizon radius but non-zero angular momentum we have that
x  , so that the brane is unstable in this situation, and turning on adiabatically
the horizon radius would not cure this instability. note, however, that c is positive
not only for x < xc but also for x > x0  x(1)
in (4.17), so the specic heat will be
positive in this situation.

free energy on the two branches

it is possible to obtain a closed form expression for the free energy on the two
branches x  xc and x  xc respectively. to this end we solve (4.20a) for x yielding

(4.23)

the two solutions

where we have used the value of c in (4.21). it is easy to check that the solution x
has the property that x  0 when   0, whereas the other solution x+ goes to
innity in that limit. thus, x describes the stable branch 0 < x  xc and x+ the
unstable branch x > xc. to obtain the explicit expression for the free energy we use
(4.20b) to express rh in terms of t and x, as well as (3.11), which together with the
horizon equation (2.8) implies f  (1 + x)rd2
h . the resulting free energy for each of
the two branches is then

(4.24)

with x given in (4.23). as a check, we note that expanding f for small  reproduces
the expansion given in (3.14), as it should. dierentiating f with respect to t gives
the entropy s(t, ), so that we can use x = 2j/s in (4.20a) to determine the exact
form of the equation of state for one non-zero angular momentum. as a curiosity we
also mention the expansion of the free energy f+ on the unstable branch,

t(cid:19)(cid:21)
f+  t 24/(d4)(cid:20)1 + o(cid:18) 

(4.25)

exhibiting a universal t 2 dependence for all branes, but due to the unstable nature
of this branch the relevance of this expression is presently unclear.
phase mixing

in ref.

[50], it was shown that for the spinning d3-brane there exists a possi-
bility that a mixing of these two phases is thermodynamically favored (maximizing
entropy), so that as a consequence of the instability angular momentum is localized
on the brane. to carry out this analysis for the general case d > 4, one needs to
work in the microcanonical ensemble and consider the mixed states determined by
(4.22). thus the problem is to maximize the entropy

sav = s(rh, x) + (1  )s(rh, x)

(4.26)

for given energy eav and angular momentum jav, subject to the constraints

jav = j(rh, x) + (1  )j(rh, x) (4.27)
eav = e(rh, x) + (1  )e(rh, x) ,
with (rh, x) expressed in (rh, x) through (4.22). we have not carried out this anal-
ysis but expect that the features observed for d = 6 (including a rst-order phase

26

transition) in [50], will persist for the other cases d > 4. we thus expect that there
will be a mixed state and rst-order phase transition at some critical value of x < xc.
the case d = 4

as pointed out before, the case d = 4 needs a special treatment, since from (3.11)
we have that the free energy vanishes, so that df = 0. this is due to the fact that
the n + 1 variables (t,{i}) are not independent anymore. indeed, for one non-zero
angular momentum we read o from (3.4) that

(2t )2 + 2 = h2

(4.28)

which characterizes the phase space. for zero angular momentum we recover the
known fact that the temperature is constant for the ns5 and d5-branes. as a
further check, using also /t = (2)2j/s in this case, the curve (4.28) implies that
sdt + jd = 0, in accord with the thermodynamic relation (3.12) with df = 0.

4.3 canonical ensemble

we also discuss the canonical ensemble for m non-zero equal angular momenta, for
which the relevant quantity t j takes the form,

t j = 1

(1+x)2 h(d  2)(d  4) + 2(cid:16)(d  2)(d  4)  (d  8)m(cid:17)x

+(d  2  2m)(d  4  4m)x2i

(4.29)

t

and we recall that the specic heat cj also vanishes at the zeroes of the temperature,
i.e. x(m)
given in (4.17). the case d = 4 is stable for any m and for d = 3 we nd the

curious behavior that there is lower bound on x namely (4 + 21)/5, so that e.g.

the positive solutions of the quadratic equation (4.29) are listed as x(m)

the non-rotating d6-brane is unstable, but becomes stable in the canonical ensemble
when the angular momentum is large enough. in the following we will restrict again
to d  5.
in table
4.1, and correspond to the boundaries of stability, with the property that for x  x(m)
the branes are stable. from the table we infer a number of observations: for one
non-zero angular momentum the branes with d = 8, 9 are stable for any value of x,
but when more angular momenta are switched on a boundary of stability emerges.
moreover, for maximal number of non-zero angular momenta all branes are stable.
to further examine the boundary of stability we use (3.4) to construct the di-

where x(m)
is dened in (4.14). the numerical values of the relevant ratio jc on the
boundary are also listed in the table 4.1. note that, in analogy with the quantity
 relevant for the grand canonical ensemble, in this case the boundary of stability
occurs also precisely at the maximum of the ratio j in (4.30a). one can also easily
obtain the corresponding critical values of  using (4.13) and the critical values x(m)
.
in parallel with the grand canonical ensemble the phase diagram for the cases with
a boundary of stability consists again of a stable and unstable sheet. it would be
interesting to examine the possibility of phase mixing along the lines described in
the previous subsection.

4.4 critical exponents

we conclude this section with a general analysis of the critical exponents in both
the ensembles for the case of one non-zero angular momentum. to this end, we note
that besides the specic heats (4.4b) and (4.4c), one also has the response functions

where t is the isothermal capacitance. the following discussion pertains to the
cases in which a boundary of stability was found in the one angular momentum
case, i.e. d  5 in the grand canonical ensemble, and d = 3, 5, 6, 7 in the canonical
ensemble.

starting with the grand canonical ensemble, we consider a point (tc, c) on the
boundary of stability16. following a similar analysis as in [47], we show that this
point behaves as a critical point in ordinary thermodynamics. the stable region has
t  tc and   c, so we dene the quantities
 =

c  

t  tc

(4.32)

t =

tc

and consider a function f (t, ) near the point (tc, c). the critical exponents nt
and n for f (t, ) are then dened as

nt =  lim
t 0

ln f

ln t(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

t 0

d ln f|=0

(4.33a)

16the boundary of stability does not have any special point other than (t = 0,  = 0) so we take

a generic point dierent from that.

28

n =  lim

ln f

ln (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t =0

f (t, c) =

f (tc, ) =

(4.33b)

(4.34)

where g(tc) and g(c) are nite and dierent from zero and both ht and h satisfy
h|x=xc = 0 and dh
dx|x=xc 6= 0. this is indeed true for the response functions c, t ,
 and the quantities (s  sc)1 and (j  jc)1.

we rst approach the critical point by varying the temperature, and hence put

 = c. using (4.20a) and (4.21) one obtains

t (x) =

here, the last step follows from ht|x=xc = 0, dht
dx |x=xc = 0 and
dx2 |x=xc 6= 0. on the other hand, approaching the critical line by varying , we
need to put t = tc and have

6= 0, dt

(4.37)

since d

dx |x=xc = 0 and d2

dx2 |x=xc 6= 0 we also nd that n = 1
2.

since each of the functions c, t , , (s  sc)1 and (j  jc)1 is of the
form (4.34), one immediately concludes that for each of these quantities the critical
exponents is equal to 1
2, which was earlier found [47] for the
non-dilatonic branes17, apparently persists and this value has been shown to be in
agreement with scaling laws in statistical physics [47].

2. the common value 1

the critical analysis in the canonical ensemble proceeds along the same lines.
in this case we consider a point (tc, jc) on the boundary of stability. repeating the
analysis above essentially with the replacement   j, and using the fact that cj ,
j , (s  sc)1 and (  c)1 are all of the form (4.34) (with   j), it follows
that also in this case all critical exponents are 1
2.

17these critical exponents should be related to the corresponding exponents in correlation func-
tions of the eld theory. in the eld theory analysis for the d3-brane case [46] no agreement was
found, but a mean eld treatment was suggested to cure this discrepancy.

29

5. field theory analysis

in this section we consider the quantum eld theories living on the d and m-branes
in the limit where they are free eld theories. using the ideal gas approximation
we compute in section 5.1 the free energies with non-zero r-voltage under the r-
symmetry. we do this to compare the thermodynamic behaviour in the weak coupling
limit with the strong coupling limit.
in section 5.2 we discuss the interpolation
between weak and strong coupling, while in section 5.3 we nd the stability behaviour
at weak coupling and compare this to the strong coupling limit.

5.1 the free energy for weakly coupled eld theory

in this section we calculate the free energies for the extremely weakly coupled limit
of the dual eld theories extending the regularization method used in [46, 50] for the
d3, m2 and m5-brane.

we start by writing the free energy with all r-charge voltages {i} turned o.
as we shall see, this depends only on the spatial dimension p of the eld theory, and
on the number of massless bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom. in particular,
the eld theories that we consider have 16 supercharges so that for n = 1 these
theories have 8 bosonic and 8 fermionic degrees of freedom. using the ideal gas
approximation, where particles are assumed to have negligible interaction, we get
the free energy18

with identical r-symmetry group have the same weights.

degeneracy of the spectrum with respect to this weight. in the n = 4 case the 8 fermions
all have same chirality under the so(8).

the integrals for the 8 bosons in (5.3) are clearly divergent since i is real. in
ref. [46] it was proposed to perform an analytic continuation by considering i to
be complex, so that using (e.5) the free energies (5.3) can be expressed in terms of
polylogarithms,

where i = i. the polylogarithms are not dened for real numbers greater than
one, but in appendix e we discuss the continuation to this region, along with some
general properties of polylogarithms.

using the exact functions bn(x) and fn(x) for x  r of appendix e, we can in
principle write all the free energies for the dierent p-branes exactly. to save space,
we restrict ourselves to write the energies with odd p exactly, and write the energies
with even p to fourth order in i. in section 5.3, however, we use the fact that all
the free energies are known to all orders in i.

for the m-branes, it is believed that n = 1 corresponds to a free eld theory,
while for n > 1 the eld theories are interacting. thus, for a single m2-brane and
m5-brane we have

5.2 interpolation between weakly and strongly coupled theories

while the expressions (5.5) represent the free energies of the m-branes for n = 1,
the supergravity results (3.17) and (3.19) are the corresponding free energies in the
n   limit. as discussed in [52] (without r-voltage i) it is expected that there is
a smooth interpolating function f (n,{i}) so that the free energy for all n is given
by

fn (t,{i}) = f (n,{i})fn =1(t,{i})

(5.7)

where fn =1(t,{i}) is the free energy for n = 1, given in (5.5). in other words,
one can conjecture that if all higher derivative terms in the eective 11-dimensional
supergravity action were known, and if one could nd the spinning black m-brane

32

solution in this eective action, one could compute the free energies for all n, and in
particular the free energies (5.5) for n = 1. the status of this conjecture, however,
is not clear since there could very well be a phase transition obstructing the smooth
interpolation to the free theory limit.

turning to the d-branes, the expressions in (5.6) represent the free energies for
n  1 and  = 0 (which in particular means that   r3p
h ), while the supergravity
results (3.21) are valid for n  1 and large t hooft coupling,   r3p
h (for the dp-
branes with p 6= 3 there is also has an upper bound on , see eq. (3.15)). thus, we
can consider the free energies of d-branes with n xed but with  varying between
the two limits just described. one can then conjecture that for xed n  1 there
exists a smooth interpolation function f (, t,{i}) so that we can write

f(t,{i}) = f (, t,{i})f=0(t,{i})

(5.8)

where f=0(t,{i}) is the free energy for  = 0. moreover, for the d3-brane the
eld theory is conformal, so that the function is expected to depend on dimensionless
quantities only, i.e. f (,{i}). the possibility of such a smooth interpolation has
previously been discussed in [52] for the d3-brane without the r-voltage. an impor-
tant rst check of this conjecture is the fact that the free energies of the d-branes
in the two limits show the same n 2 factor in front. this implies that only string
1
loop corrections, which carry factors of
n 2 would modify this behavior, and thus do
not have to be considered in the large n limit. comparing the -dependence on the
other hand, one sees that only for the d3-brane the same form is found in the two
limits. again, if one knew the higher derivative terms of the eective action of type
ii string theory and one could solve the equations of motion for a spinning black d-
brane, one could presumably nd the smooth interpolation between the two limits of
. again, this conjecture assumes that there is not a phase transition between weak
and strong coupling. this assumption has been challenged in [60] for the d3-brane.
we will return to this issue in section 6.2, where we calculate the leading order
correction in 3/2 to the d3-brane free energy, due to the l6
sr4 term in the type iib
eective action. in section 5.3 we take another path and compare the thermodynamic
behavior of the eld theory in the two limits, including a study of the thermodynamic
stability.

5.3 stability behavior at weak coupling

we analyze the thermodynamic stability of the weakly coupled qfts using the free
energies (5.5) and (5.6). for simplicity, we restrict ourselves to the case of one
non-zero voltage 1 = . as a consequence, branes with equal number of spatial
dimensions p have the same thermodynamics, since our analysis is not aected by
the overall dependence on n.

from the gibbs free energy f = f (t, ) we compute the heat capacity

c = t(cid:16)2f
t 2(cid:17)

(5.9)

and in the cases we consider, one can check that c is always positive. instead we
can extract the stability behaviour by considering the hessian matrix

hes(f ) =  2f

(5.10)

of the free energy f = f (t, ). for a stable point, the hessian (5.10) should be
negative denite. since c is positive for  = 0, the boundary of stability is reached
when one of the eigenvalues of the hessian (5.10) changes sign. since there are no
singularities this occurs when det(hes(f )) = 0, so that the boundary of stability is
characterized by a certain critical value of  = /t . the results of the analysis for
the various values of p are given in table 5.2. to analyze the cases of even p, we use
that we know the free energy to all orders in . thus, one can take an appropriate
number of terms in order to ensure that the value of  that one nds has the required
accuracy.

considering table 5.2 we see that most branes have a boundary of stability at a
certain value of , as also seen in the stability analysis of section 4.2. we also remark
that all the values of  in table 5.2 have the same orders of magnitude as the values
in table 4.1, and thus it seems plausible that the conjectured interpolation between
the two limits of the qfts described in section 5.1 should connect the values of .
table 5.3 summarizes the values of  for the weak and strong coupling limits of the
d, and m-branes, and for the d2, d3, d4, m2 and m5-branes the critical values of 
in the two limits are seen to be remarkably close. we also note that  is increasing
with p in both limits.

the d1-brane and d6-brane, however, are seen from table 5.3 to have qualita-
tively dierent stability behaviour in the weak and strong coupling limits, so that in

table 5.3: comparison between the boundaries of stability for the type ii dp-branes n
the weak and strong coupling limits of  and for the m-branes in the n = 1 and n  
limits.

this case the interpolation should somehow create or destroy a boundary of stability
at some special point between the two limits.
if we for deniteness think about
the qft living on n d1-branes on top of each other, we see that for  = 0 it is
stable, also with r-voltage turned on, while for  large it should exhibit a boundary
of stability. thus, at some value of  the qft makes a transition from being com-
pletely stable to being potentially unstable. it would be interesting to study how
this mechanism works in detail.

for the d5-branes we also have completely dierent qualitative behaviour. at
weak coupling we can vary the thermodynamic parameters t and {i} freely, while
at strong coupling, they are constrained (see section 4.2). thus, somehow the phase
space must expand as one moves away from strong coupling. one could also try to
study this phenomenon for non-rotating branes, here the temperature is constant at
strong coupling.

if we instead consider the canonical ensemble, with variables t and j, one must

consider the heat capacity

cj = t(cid:16) s
t(cid:17)j

= t det(hes(f ))(cid:20)(cid:16) j

(cid:17)t(cid:21)1

(5.11)

thus, we see that cj is zero whenever det(hes(f )) is, i.e. the canonical ensemble
has the same stability behaviour as the grand canonical ensemble. this result should
not be surprising since we in fact have used standard statistical physics to derive our
thermodynamic relations, so that it is expected that general results, such as the
equivalence of ensembles, should hold. nevertheless, it would be interesting to test
this by computing corrections to the stability behaviour from the weakly coupled
eld theory side, or the supergravity side, since the results of section 4 show that
the thermodynamic ensembles are not equivalent in the strongly coupled large n
limit. if we consider a d-brane, the expectation would be that the boundaries of

35

stability in the two dierent ensembles start for  = 0 at the same value, move away
from each other as  increases and nally reach the values given in section 4.

finally we note that, with respect to the critical exponents there is also a qualita-
tive dierence between the weak and strong coupling limit of the qft. as discussed

in section 4.4 the heat capacities c and cj both behave as 1/t  tc near the
boundary of stability. but, in the weak coupling limit one can easily check that
c and cj both behave as (t  tc) with   0,  being dierent for the two
heat capacities. another way to see this, is to note that while the heat capacities
in the strong coupling limit have singularities on the boundary of stability, they are
continuous in the weak coupling limit.

in conclusion we see that there are many similarities between the thermodynam-
ics at weak and at strong coupling (or small and large n for the m-branes), but
also important qualitative dierences that are non-trivial to connect by an interpo-
lation between the two limits. in the next section we make the rst step towards a
quantitative understanding of this conjectured interpolation for spinning branes.

6. free energies from the supergravity action

it is well known that one can obtain the free energy of a eld theory by wick rotation
and evaluating the path integral partition function with the boundary condition that
time is periodic with the inverse temperature as period. for general relativity, this
method has been applied in order to compute the free energy of a black hole, but,
with some diculty since one need to think of ways to circumvent the problems of
quantizing the gravitational eld. in anti-de sitter space though, this has proved
surprisingly easy since one can just evaluate the action on the background geometry
[51]. moreover, the free energy for the near-horizon limit of the d3, m2 and m5-
brane has been reproduced with this method [29], which is not surprising since these
branes all have anti-de sitter space times a sphere as their near-horizon geometry.
in section 6.1 we will extend these results to spinning branes in the near-horizon
limit, showing that we are able to reproduce the free energy (3.11) found in section
3.2. in section 6.2 we compute the rst correction in 1/ to the free energy of the
spinning d3-brane found in section 6.1. this will then be used to test the conjecture
that there exists a smooth interpolating function between  = 0 and  = , as
discussed in section 5.2.

in this section we
obtain the free energy (3.11) as ie/, where  = 1/t is the inverse temperature
and ie is the regularized value of the euclidean action (6.1) evaluated on the wick
rotated spinning p-brane solution in the near-horizon limit. we restrict ourselves to
one non-zero angular momentum, since we expect that because the free energy (3.11)
is independent of the angular momentum, more non-zero angular momenta will not
alter our nal result.

in appendix c we perform a wick rotation of the near-horizon solution (3.2) in
the presence of one non-zero angular momentum, to obtain the euclidean spinning
brane solution (c.3). starting with the bulk term (6.2), we substitute (c.3) and
integrate over the time  and the angles to arrive at the following general expression

can be computed in principle through any desired order for any brane solution.

to evaluate the nal integral over r we need to introduce a regularization method
along the lines of [29, 52]. in this prescription we rst perform the integral up to
a cuto radius rmax and subtract the contribution of the extremal brane with a
temperature equal to the original brane at the cuto radius rmax. thus, integrating
the expression (6.4) from the horizon radius rh to the cuto radius rmax we arrive at

this fact will be used implicitly when we calculate string corrections to the free en-
ergy of the spinning d3-brane in section 6.2.

6.2 corrections from higher derivative terms

in this section we test the conjecture that there exists smooth interpolation functions
between strong and weak t hooft coupling  = g2
ymn for the d-branes, as discussed
in section 5.1. the idea is to compute the correction to the free energy from the
sr4 term in type ii string theory since this gives us the rst correction in 1/.
l6

we restrict ourselves to the case of the d3-brane, since the constant dilaton for
the non-corrected solution makes the computation considerably easier. the extremal
non-rotating d3-brane has the geometry ads5 s5 in the near-horizon limit and the
dual eld theory is the n=4 d = 4 sym [7]. for the spinning d3-brane the dual
eld theory is n=4 d = 4 sym at nite temperature with the r-voltage turned on.
the free energy of the spinning d3-brane in the strong and weakly coupled limits
has previously been discussed in [46, 24, 50].

we furthermore restrict ourselves to one non-zero angular momentum only but
the methods we use can easily be extended to more angular momenta. to simplify
the computations, we work in the limit    with  = /t . this corresponds to
the limit l  r0. we develop all series in  to order 4, with the next corrections
coming from a 6 term. with this, our results are accurate for  < 1 up to about
1%.

thus, we will test the interpolation between the free energy

conjecture (5.8) as

where f = f (, ) is the interpolation function. to zeroth order in 1/ we thus have

f ( = , ) =

644 4 + o(6)

(6.19)

comparing (6.16) and (6.17) we see that we should expect f (, ) to be smaller than
one, and we also expect it to be decreasing with , for xed  < 1, since

f= < f=0 for  < 1

(6.20)

i.e. the absolute value of the free energy for  =  is less than the one for  = 0 for
 < 1. in ref. [52] the interpolation function f (, ) was studied for  = 0, and it
was found that

f (, 0) =

(6.21)

by computation of the correction from the l6
sr4 term in type iib string theory.
the computation (6.21) clearly supports the conjecture that there is a monotonous
smooth interpolation function, since the 3/2 correction is positive21.

as previously stated, the higher derivative correction term22 in the supergravity
sr4 term. in the

action for type iib string theory that we want to consider is the l6
euclidean case, the term is given in the einstein frame by

21on the weak coupling side, a two loop calculation [62] has shown that the leading correction in
 is negative, giving further evidence for the interpolation conjecture. in [63] further corrections in
 from the weak coupling side are considered and also found to support the interpolation conjecture.
22for dual eld theories with a smaller amount of supersymmetry, refs.[64, 65] consider analogous

higher derivative corrections to obtain the modication of the thermodynamics.

string theory admits two dierent kinds of expansions, the loop expansion in
s. in particular, for the type iib r4 term
gs and the derivative expansion in  = l2
sr4, and an innite sum of d-instanton
s l6
there is also a one-loop term of the form g2
corrections. through the ads/cft correspondence this translates into a 1/n and
[66] which also discusses the instanton corrections). the
1/ expansion (see e.g.
l6
sr4 tree-level term becomes then a 3/2r4 term, while the g2
sr4 one loop term
becomes an n21/2r4 term. the n21/2r4 term is clearly not interesting for this
computation, since we want to keep n xed and large. it is also subleading since we
keep gs small in the limit we consider.

we now compute the 1/ correction to the free energy (6.17) by inserting the
non-corrected wick rotated solution (c.3a) for the euclidean spinning d3-brane in
the near-horizon limit, into the higher derivative term (6.22) as the background
geometry. substituting the solution we nd for the rst three terms23 in a weak

which follows from (d.3) with one angular momentum turned on only and the re-

finally, we write the result (6.28) in terms of the thermodynamic parameters t ,

which includes (6.19) and (6.21) as special cases. because of (6.20) we expect the
correction term in (6.32) to be positive for  < 1 and this is indeed the case. since
the corrections away from  =  behave as expected, we consider this as further
evidence for the interpolation conjecture (6.18) in the case of spinning d3-branes,

it is not a priori apparent that the method used to compute (6.32) gives the full
result to rst order in , since this semi-classical method does not consider induced
perturbations of the geometry. however, we note that for the non-rotating d3-brane
case, the perturbed metric induced by the correction term (6.22) was shown [52, 53]
to yield the same correction to the free energy as the semiclassical approximation
in which the correction is evaluated for the original unperturbed metric24. thus, it
seems that the thermodynamics somehow disregards perturbations of the geometry.
we expect this to hold also for non-dilatonic spinning branes. it would be interesting,

24this feature has been shown to persist as well for the corrections to the near-horizon m2 and

m5-brane backgrounds originating from the r4 term in m-theory [67].

though technically dicult, to nd the actual perturbed metric for the spinning d3-
brane and determine whether the result is still given by (6.32). another interesting
check on the interpolation function (6.32) would be to compute the 1/ correction
to the boundary of stability. from the values in table 5.3 we would expect this
correction to be positive.

a. thermodynamics of black p-branes in the near-horizon

limit

in this appendix we consider the thermodynamics, and in particular the energy
above extremality in the near-horizon limit of a general non-rotating p-brane. we
also derive the smarr formula and check that it is fullled. this means that the
rst law of thermodynamics is obeyed in the near-horizon limit, and that there are
no extra thermodynamic parameters related to the charge. we begin by giving a
short review of the classication of p-branes that preserve a certain fraction of the
supersymmetry (in the extremal limit).

a black p-brane solution of the action (2.1) is characterized by a particular value

of a. if we dene

in this appendix we give the euclidean version of the near-horizon solution (3.2)
for one non-zero angular momentum. this comes into play in sections 6.1 and 6.2
when calculating the value of the action and of the corrected action. the euclidean
solutions can simply be obtained by performing the wick rotation

(c.1)

this induces the replacement l2
i in the denitions of ld of (2.7a) and kd, 
of the spheroidal metric (2.6). in addition, we nd that in the metric (3.2a) we have

d. change of variables from (r0, {li}) to (t, {i})

in this appendix we give the formulae needed to go from the supergravity variables
(r0,{li}) to the thermodynamic quantities (t,{i}). since it is not possible to obtain
closed expressions (for general d) for this change of variables, we perform this analysis
in a weak angular momentum expansion

keeping the rst three terms only, which suces for the applications of the text.

e. polylogarithms

in this appendix we dene the polylogarithm functions and give some general prop-
erties. we also discuss a continuation of the polylogarithms to real numbers greater
than one, which is used in section 5.1. the nth polylogarithm function is dened as

lin(z) =

zk
kn

(e.1)



xk=1

for z  c  {u  r + 2iz|re(u) > 1}, where re(u) means the real part of u.
satisfying

we also have the relation

where we have dened

lin(1) = (n) for n 6= 1

lin(1) = (n)

(n) =(cid:26) (1  21n)(n)

 log(2)

,
,

n 6= 1
n = 1

the polylogarithm satises the integral formula

z 

0

dx xn2 log(1  ezx) = (n  1)lin(ez)

for z  {u  c|im(u) 6 2z}.

we also dene

1

bn(z) =

2(cid:0)lin(ez) + lin(ez)(cid:1)
2(cid:0)lin(ez) + lin(ez)(cid:1)

1

for z  {u  c|im(u)  [, ]  {0}}, and

fn(z) =

for z  {u  c|im(u)  (, )}.

for even n we have

n/2

zn1
(n  1)!
where the optional sign is the sign of im(z). for odd n we have

z2k
(2k)!

where the optional sign is the sign of im(z). these functions satisfy

bn2(z) =

d2
dz2 bn(z)

for any n. considering fn, we nd that for even n we have

and for odd n we have

it is easy to see that

fn(z) =

fn(z) =

n/2

xk=0

fn2(z) =

(e.13)

for any n.

if we want to dene bn(z) also for z  r we can note that while the imaginary
part of bn(z) changes sign when crossing the real line, the real part is continuous.
thus, it is natural to dene bn on the real line as the limit of the real part of bn. this
is also what the principal value prescription gives, since this is 1
2(b(x+i)+b(xi))
for   0+ with x  r. thus, let x  r, then for even n we write

bn(x) =

(n  2k)
