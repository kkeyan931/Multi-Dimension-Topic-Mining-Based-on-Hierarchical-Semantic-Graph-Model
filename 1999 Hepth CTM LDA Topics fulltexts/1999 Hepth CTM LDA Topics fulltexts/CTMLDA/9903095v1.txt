we investigate the role of massless magnetic monopoles in the n = 4 supersymmetric

yang-mills higgs theories. they can appear naturally in the 1/4-bps dyonic congura-

tions associated with multi-pronged string congurations. massless magnetic monopoles

can carry nonabelian electric charge when their associated gauge symmetry is unbro-

ken. surprisingly, massless monopoles can also appear even when the gauge symmetry

is broken to abelian subgroups.

recently there has been several activities in trying to understand multi-pronged strings ending

on d3 branes in the type iib string theory [1]. 1/2 bps monopoles and w-bosons in n = 4 super-

symmetric yang-mills theories appear naturally as d-strings and fundamental strings connecting

parallel d3 branes in type iib string theory [2]. 1/4-bps multi-pronged string webs have a natural

interpretation in the n=4 supersymmetric yang-mills theories: they correspond to the congu-

rations of many dyons separated in some distance, balanced under the electromagnetic coulomb

force and more complicated higgs force [3]. when there are several dyons, the conguration can

be spherically symmetric for some cases and more explicit eld conguration can be obtained [4].

the number of zero modes of these congurations is somewhat complicated [5, 1], than the 1/2

bps monopole case [6]

for 1/4-bps congurations of dyons, only two independent components of six higgs elds in n =

4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory get involved [3]. one component of the higgs elds determines

the masses of magnetic monopoles, and some of them can be massless. as two independent higgs

asymptotic values determine the symmetry breakng pattern, the gauge symmetry corresponding

to the massless monopole can be unbroken or broken. when the gauge symmetry for the massless

monopoles is not broken, they can not exist in isolation. but in presence of other massive magnetic

monopoles, their presence can be felt. especially they can carry nonabelian electric charge. when

4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory get involved [3]. one component of the higgs elds determines

the masses of magnetic monopoles, and some of them can be massless. as two independent higgs

monopoles, their presence can be felt. especially they can carry nonabelian electric charge. when

the gauge symmetry is completely broken, the corresponding massless monopoles will become

massive in isolation. this case, their appearance seems mysterious.

in this paper, we investigate in detail the physics of such massless monopoles in 1/4-bps dy-

onic congurations by employing a simple model. the simple model we study is based on the

congurations for three distinct monopoles when the gauge symmetry is broken from su (4) to
u (1)  su (2)  u (1) or u (1)3.

there are several facinating problems associated with monopoles when the unbroken gauge sym-

metry has a nonabelian subgroup. when massive magnetic monopoles carry nonabelian magnetic

charge, it is well known that one cannot dene the electric nonabelian transformations globally

around them, which is called the global color problem [7]. the main reason behind it is that

the inertia for some of global gauge transformations become innite. this is associated with the

fact that the corresponding zero modes are nonnormalizable. when there are several magnetic

monopoles so that the net magnetic charge is purely abelian, then one can dene the global color

transformations without such obstruction.

there is also the issue of massless monopoles. when the gauge symmetry is partially restored

from abelian group to nonabelian group, some of magnetic monopoles become massless. the idea

2

of such monopoles in isolation is meaningless: their size becomes innite and their eld strength

vanishes. however, it is known now that these massless monopoles can leave some footprints

when one start with several other monopoles [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. the physics of massless monopoles

becomes especially simpler when the net magnetic charge remain abelian. in this case massless

monopoles form magnetic cloud surrounding massive magnetic monopoles, and so the net magnetic

charge is abelian. in the massless limit, the dimension of moduli space does not change, but the

characteristics of moduli parameters for massless monopoles changes drastically. some of them

describe the orbit of unbroken electric gauge transformations, and the rest do the cloud shape

parameters [8]. when there are several identical massless monopoles, some of them can be taken

to the innity, making the net magnetic charge to be nonabelian. in this case the global charge is

not well dened, but there will be still some remaining cloud parameters.

when we consider a single higgs eld case, the magnetic monopole conguration describes 1/2-

bps states. the moduli space dynamics of the zero modes of three distinct fundamental monopoles,
when su (4) is broken to u (1)3, has been studied in dynamics detail in the moduli space approxi-

mation [13]. also, the moduli space of these monopoles when one for the middle root of the dynkin

diagram becomes massless has been studied [8]. more recently, the detail eld conguration of such

a system [12] have been obtained by using the adhmn construction [14]. its salient feature is that

four zero mode parameters for the massless monopole are composed of three su (2) gauge orbit

parameters and one gauge invariant parameter. the nonabelian cloud surrounding the massive

monopoles takes an ellipsoid shape, at whose two focal points lie two massive monopoles. the size

of the ellipsoid is the gauge invariant parameter.

as shown in ref. [3], 1/4-bps congurations for dyons have only two relevant components of six

higgs elds, i , i = 1, ..., 6. the bps enery bound is saturated when the several bps equations

are satised. they can be put into two bps equations,

bi = dib  ,
d2
i a    [b  , [b  , a  ]] = 0,

(1)

(2)

where ai and bi are two orthonormal vectors in 6 dimensions and decided by the electric and

magnetic charge vectors,

qm

qe

i = 2z d3xi(trbii ),
i = 2z d3xi(treii ).

(3)

(4)

it was shown that the the second bps equation is identical to the unbroken gauge zero modes for

the rst bps equation. the rst equation is solved in ref. [12]. to solve the second equation, we

3

follow the method in ref. [3].

to start, we assume that the asymptotic value of b   is diagonalized to be

b  () = diag(h1, h2, h3, h4) = h  h,

(5)

in this case the gauge symmetry is
where we choose the gauge so that h1 < h2 < h3 < h4.
spontaneously broken to u (1)3. there exists a unique set of unit length simple roots, , ,  such

that their inner product with h in the root space is positive denite. we can choose the order so

that

  h = diag(1/2, 1/2, 0, 0),
  h = diag(0,1/2, 1/2, 0),
  h = diag(0, 0,1/2, 1/2).

the masses of , , and  monopoles are 4 times

1 = h2  h1,
2 = h3  h2,
3 = h4  h3,

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

respectively. (here we put the gauge coupling constant to be unity.)

we consider three distinct fundamanetal monopoles, whose magnetic charge is

g = 4( +  + ).

(10)

in the limit 2 = 0, the electric gauge symmetry is partially restored to u (1)  su (2)  u (1).
in this limit the  monopole becomes massless and the above magnetic charge remain abelian as
g   = 0. from the rst bps equation, the magnectic charge is related to the asymptotic form of
b  ,

b   = b  () 

g  h
4r

+ o(cid:18) 1

r2(cid:19) .

(11)

similarly, the electric charge

q = q + q + q

is related to the the asymptotic form of a  ,

a   = a  () 

q  h
4r

+ o(cid:18) 1

r2(cid:19) .

(12)

(13)

one goal of this paper is to nd the electric charge q for the given magnetic charge conguration
and a  ().

the eld congurations satisfying the rst bps equation has been obtained by weinberg and yi

in ref. [12]. let us review briey this derivation for the later sake. for this purpose, we put the

position of three monopoles at

r = (0, 0,

r),

(14)

(15)

(16)

where m = 1 + 3. the origin coincides with the position of the center of mass. the relative

positions of the  monopole with respect to two massive monopoles are

yl = r  r,
yr = r  r.

(17)

we call their magnitude yl, yr. in the limit where  monopole becomes massless, the unbroken

su (2) gauge invariant parameters are

r = |r  r|,
d = yl + yr.

(18)

(19)

r is the distance between two massive monopoles and d is the cloud parameter. for a given d,

the position of the massless monopole becomes two dimensional ellipsoidal surface. as shown in

ref. [12], the nonabelian component of magnetic charge becomes dipole-like outside this ellipsoid.

thus our conguration has a nonabelian ellipsoidal cloud surrounding the coulomb like nonabelian

source such that the total conguration is completely abelian. one could regard that the nonabelian

cloud as a reminiscent of the conning string of quarks in a meson of qcd. here it does not give

a linear potential, but neutralizes in the color magnetic charge.

from the asympototic value of b  , we see three invervals [h1, h2], [h2, h3] and [h3, h4] for the
parameter t of the nahm equation. the nahm data, which is the solution of the nahm equation,

is

(27)

(28)

where v(t) is a 2  4 matrix and s2, s3 are 4-dimensional row vectors. sometimes, we regard v(t)
and s2, s3 as four independent solutions of the above equation. the normalization condition is

(29)

there are four independent solutions of v(t) and s2, s3 of eq. (28), which form four columns.

the rst two independent solutions are continuous solutions with s2 = s3 = 0. in the limit 2 = 0,
v(t) for two solutions can be put in a 2  2 matrix,

there are two additional independent solutions, which can be written together as a 2 2 matrix,

v(t) =   f1(t)1,

f2(t)2,

t  (h3, h4)

(38)

where i, j = 2, 3 and ,  = 1, 2 are column indices.

from these solutions for v(t) and s2 and s3, one can nd the higgs eld of the rst bps equation

by using the formula,

b  (r) = z h4

h1

dt t v(t)v(t) + h2s

2s2 + h3s

3s3.

(39)

the characteristic of this eld is discussed in ref. [12]. we note here that this solution has the

desired asymptotic form (11), once a further gauge transformation in su (4) is made.

the second bps equation can be solved by the nding the zero modes corresponding to the
global part of the unbroken gauge group u (1) su (2) u (1). we use the strategy used in ref. [3].
in our context we need to nd an ordinary function p(t) for a given traceless diagonal matrix

q = diag(q1, q2, q3, q4). p(t) saties the ordinary equation

where

p(t)  w (t)p(t) + (t) = 0,

w (t) = tr 2a
(t) = q2tr 2a

1a1(t  h2) + tr 2a
1a1(t  h2) + q3tr 2a

2a2(t  h3),

2a2(t  h3).

the boundary conditions for p(t) are

p(h1) = q1 and

p(h4) = q4.

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

this boundary conditions can be obtained easily by taking the limit of the additional monopole

need for a single calaron to innity [3].

7

in the limit 2 = 0, the solution becomes considerably simplied. the solution is

p(t) =  q1 + b1(t  h1)

(46)

(47)

in this paper we are not interested in the detail structure of the second higgs eld in nite region,

which is associated with the fact how d3 branes are deformed to have multi-pronged string shape.

instead we are interested in only the asymptotic behaviour of the eld (r). by taking the similar

approach as in ref. [12], we can get the asymptotic form

(48)

where c = 2q1 + 21b1  q2  q3. one can easily show that this hermitan matrix is traceless. this
is the asymptotic form of the general solution for the second bps equation.

there are three independent choices of the charge diag(q1, q2, q3, q4) such that pi qi = 0, which
lead to three independent solutions, 1(r), 2(r), 3(r) for the second bps equation. a   is in
general a linear combination of these three solutions. for simplicity, we consider three cases where
a   to be proportional to i for each i = 1, 2, 3.

first one is the obvious one,

in this case the asymptotic value 1()  b  (), so that four d3 branes will lie on a line.
the electric charge will be proportional to the total magnetic charge. the conguration becomes

1 = b  (r).

(49)

1/2-bps rather than 1/4-bps.

8

the second case appears with the gauge symmetry being still broken to u (1)  su (2)  u (1).
however, parallel d3 branes do not lie on a line. in this case, the asymptotic form is

2 = diag(23,1  3,1  3, 21)

(q + q + q)  h + o(cid:18) 1

where

3)r},

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

the electric charges depend only on the su (2) gauge invariant parameters d and r. there is

a global part of the unbroken local su (2) gauge group, which exchanges two middle diagonal

components. under this, the sign of the r term in q changes. (notice also that both  and 

electric charges are not invariant under the su (2) gauge transformations.)

when the cloud size is smallest so that d = r, q is equal to q or q, depending this sign. this
is consistent with the view in ref. [12] that the massless  monopole lies on the top of the  or 

monopole in the minimum cloud size case. in the large d limit, there exist the critical amounts of

electric charges. similar to the su (3) case, when the electric charges exceed the critical amounts,

there is no 1/4 bps congurations because the electric repusion overcomes the higgs attraction.

the electric charge does not need to vanish even when all three monopoles are overlapped so

that d = r = 0 unless their core sizes are identical 1 = 3. when two massive monopoles are
overlapped so that r = 0, note that q is purely abelian as q   = 0.

the third case will be

3 = diag(0,1  3, 1 + 3, 0)

(55)

(56)

(57)

as a    3, the gauge symmetry is completely broken to u (1)3. hence, there is no massless
monopoles in isolation. since our massless monopole appears accidently, its location should be

physical.

indeed the electric charges depend on it. the reason behind the appearance of this

9

massless monopole is not transparent. to nd this, let us start from three distinct massive magnetic

monopoles. when there are two higgs expectation values which are not parallel, these monopoles

attracted to each other. let us put some electric charges such that relative charges are not zero,

and then three dyons have repulsive force between them. they will be settled, separated in some

distance. also the core of dyons gets larger. when electric charges are increasing, two vectors ai

and bi are transforming. if the condition is right, it seems that any one of them appears massless

as far as the rst bps equation is concerned. our case corresponds to the case where the middle

monopole becomes massless.

in this letter, we have analyzed the role of massless monopoles in 1/4-bps conguratons, which

are associated with multipronged strings. there are a few questions to be remain. we do not

have a good understanding of some cases. for example, consider a case where the gauge symmetry

is maximally broken to abelian subgroup, and some of magnetic monopoles appear massless, but

that the net magnetic charge is not purely abelian. if such a case is possible, the question is the

global color problem seems to appear. this may need more careful understanding of the massless

limit [15]. there has been several works to understand the s-duality in case where there are

nonabelian massive magnetic monopoles [16] and also the dual version of massless monopoles. our

work may be helpful in this direction. for this we need to understand how to quantize the classical

congurations we have obtained. recently, the new way of obtaining the electric charges has been

obtained [17]. it would be nice to check our result by that method. finally, we believe this work is

a step toward to the understanding between the attractive forces between massive monopoles via

massless monopoles.
