abstract

the aim of this paper is to give a rm and clear proof of the existence in the background
eld framework of a gauge invariant eective action for any gauge theory (background gauge
equivalence). here by eective action we mean a functional whose legendre transform restricted
to the physical shell generates the matrix elements of the connected s-matrix. we resume and
clarify a former argument due to abbott, grisaru and schaefer based on the gauge-artifact
nature of the background elds and on the identication of the gauge invariant eective action
with the generator of the proper, background eld, vertices.

1. introduction

the analysis at lep of the eective couplings of the intermediate bosons of the electro-weak
interactions has further increased the need of an ecient parametrization method for the low
energy eective actions of gauge theories.

in general these eective actions are identied with the functionals generating the fully
renormalized vertices and propagators contributing to the skeleton graphs, technically speaking,
the proper, 1-particle irreducible, amplitudes. therefore they are controlled by the non-linear
slavnov-taylor identity accounting for the brs symmetry of the gauge theories.

since the introduction by de witt [1] of the background eld method it is believed that,
computing the s matrix, the above mentioned eective actions are equivalent to those generating
the background eld amplitudes, that is the amplitudes with only background eld external
legs. the background eld eective actions are gauge invariant and hence allow a much simpler
parametrization of couplings than the brs invariant quantum eld eective actions.

the rst proofs of this background gauge equivalence, due to de witt and t hooft [2],
were limited to the rst loop approximation; however more recently abbott [3] has introduced a
complete and consistent renormalization method, based on the background eld gauge xing, and
implementing the gauge invariance under background gauge transformations to all perturbative
orders. in this framework abbott, grisaru and schaefer (ags [4]) have suggested how the proof
of the background gauge equivalence could be extended to all orders of perturbation theory;
however in our opinion a denite and clear proof of this equivalence is still laking. the purpose
of this paper if to ll this gap.

the argument used by ags in their proof is that the background eld is introduced as a
gauge-artifact and hence the s-matrix should not depend on its choice. they refer to a pure
yang-mills theory for which the denition of the s-matrix is out of reach, since the scattering
amplitudes are aected with perturbative and non-perturbative infra-red singularities. however
the argument is general enough to be directly extended to any gauge theory.

to make our proof as clear and rm as possible, we shall refer to an su (2) higgs model, for
which the s-matrix is dened in perturbation theory, specifying a complete set of renormalization
conditions. we shall also make extended use of the functional formalism that, as it is now well
known, allows a precise translation of the diagrammatic framework in which the original ags
argument was formulated.

first of all we give a precise idea of the ags argument and of the open points in the original

proof.

for this we have to recall some general fact about the functional method [5]. let j label a
system of sources of the quantized elds , and  label the external elds coupled to a system of
composite operators. we dene by zc [j,  ] the functional generator of the connected amplitudes,
j zc|j= =0 = 0 , the
those corresponding to connected feynman graphs. under the condition:



2

legendre transform  of zc [j,  ] is given by :

zc [j,  ] = (cid:20) 

j

zc, (cid:21) +z j


j

zc .

(1.1)

 is the functional generator of the one-particle-irreducible amplitudes and identies a natural
choice for an eective action of the theory; in fact (1.1) means that a generic connected amplitude
can be written in the form of a tree graph whose lines and vertices are dened from the functional
derivatives of . assuming the second j-derivative of zc, that is the full propagator, not to be
degenerate, one has

j =



f ph (cid:20) 




zc[j,  ] = 




j

zc, (cid:21) ,
(cid:20) 

j

zc, (cid:21) .

(1.2)

(1.3)

it is worth noticing here that, solving (1.2) with the initial condition zc[0, 0] = 0, one gets
zc [j,  ] satisfying (1.1), since both (1.2) and (1.1) identify uniquely the connected functional.

whenever the theory is infra-red safe, one can introduce the asymptotic eld sources jas and
use lsz reduction formulae [6]. this can be achieved by a translation of the eld sources j. for
example, in the case of a scalar eld with mass m one has:

j(x)  j(x) + jas(x)  j(x) + z 1z d4yd4z k(x  z; m)+(z  y; m) f as (y) .

(1.4)

where z is a normalization constant and +(y  z; m) is the positive frequency part of the
wightman function of the free scalar eld and k(z  x; m)  (cid:0)2 + m2(cid:1) 4(z  x) . in general
the same formula holds replacing z , + and k with matrices in the eld components, and
(1.4) can be written in the form:

jas  z 1k  +  f as .

(1.5)

the introduction of the asymptotic sources allows to dene the elements of the connected scat-
tering matrix sc according to:

sc = zc [jas;  ] .

(1.6)

given by

+(y  z; m) =z d3k

(2)3

eik(yz)

2k

=z d4k

(2)3

(cid:0)k2

 m2(cid:1) (cid:0)k0(cid:1) eik(yz)

3

in general only a subset of the asymptotic elds correspond to physical particles and only some
of the composite operators have physical meaning. thus one has to select the physical matrix
elements of sc, that is:

on account of (1.1) one has also:

sph

c  zchjph;  phi .

sph

c = (cid:20) 

j

zchjph;  phi ,  ph(cid:21) +z jph 

j

zchjph;  phi .

(1.7)

(1.8)

in the framework of gauge theories, introducing the background eld v according to ab-
botts all-order scheme, v is identied with the source of a composite operator (such as  ) that
appears in the gauge xing. if j is the source of the gauge eld a and we assume the existence
of the corresponding asymptotic eld and source jas
 , we can
dene sph

 whose restriction to physics is jph

c according to (1.7) and we get:



v

zchjph

 ; v,  phi = 0 ,

(1.9)

since the background eld is a gauge xing parameter. in this framework (1.1) corresponds to:

zc [j; v,  ] = " 

j

zc [j; v,  ] ; v, # +z j


j

zc [j; v,  ] ,

(1.10)

and hence, using (1.8) we can write:

sph

c = " 

j

zchjph

 ; v,  phi ; v,  ph# +z jph




j

zchjph

 ; v,  phi .

(1.11)

now, from (1.3) and (1.9) we have:



v

zchjph

 ; v,  phi = 



v

" 

j

zchjph

 ; v,  phi ; v,  ph# = 0 ,

(1.12)

meaning that in (1.11) we can, more or less, arbitrarily change the variable v in  (however
not in zc). therefore replacing: v  zc
sc = " 

 ; v,  phi ,  ph# +z jph

 ; v,  phi . (1.13)

zchjph

 ; v,  phi ;

zchjph

zchjph

, we can write:


j



j

j


j

4

formally this equation can be interpreted as equivalent to (1.11) after the substitution:

 [a; v]   [a; a] .

(1.14)

on account of the gauge invariance of  [a; a] [4] this could be interpreted, following ags,
as a general background gauge equivalence proof. more precisely, if zc in (1.13) were solution
of the equation:

zc [j] ;


j

zc [j]#

j

zc [j] = " 
+z j


j

zc [j] ,

(1.15)

(1.13) would give the proof of the existence of a gauge invariant eective action (in fact  [a; a])
for our gauge theory. this is however not the case; in particular  [a; a] cannot contain
any gauge xing term; the term existing in  [a; v] has been cancelled by the substitution
(1.14):(g.f. [a; a] = 
former interpretation of (1.13) dicult to verify.

2 (cid:0)v(a  v)(cid:1)2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)v=a  0). therefore (1.15) is singular and the

the natural way to overcome this diculty would be to start from the eective action:

 [a; a,  ] + g.f. [a; 0] ,

(1.16)

and to dene the corresponding connected functional generator according to:

zc [j;  ] = "

between the solution of (1.17) and that of (1.10). we shall follow this line in next sections.
in particular in section 2 we shall describe the su(2)-higgs-model recalling the structure of
the background gauge lagrangian, the functional identities constraining the model and the
normalization conditions for the amplitudes. in section 3 we shall briey discuss the physical
functional variables. in section 4 we shall dene the gauge invariant eective action and we shall
discuss the proof of the background equivalence theorem. the extent of our proof is discussed
in section 5.

2. the reference model

in this section we discuss the quantization rules of an su (2) higgs model [7]. these rules,
beyond the assignment of a classical action, dene the symmetry constraints, written in the form
of functional dierential equations for the connected generator zc and the eective action , and
the normalization conditions for vertices and propagators. to simplify the symmetry constraints
we use the lautrup-nakanishi auxiliary elds [8] inserting them, as lagrange multipliers, in the
gauge xing term of the lagrangian. since the lagrangian is quadratic in these auxiliary elds,
integrating over them, leads directly to the conventional feynman-t hooft gauge xing.

just to x symbols and functional variables we begin listing the quantum elds and the
background ones. for simplicity we avoid spinor elds. thus the theory is built in terms of the
quantum elds:

 =

1

2  2 + i1

  i3 ! , a  (a1

, a2

, a3

) .

the corresponding background elds are:

 =

1

2   2 + i1

  i3 ! , v   (v 1

 , v 2

 , v 3

 ) .

(2.1)

(2.2)

following faddeev and popov, the gauge xing procedure requires the introduction of a system
of ghosts and anti-ghosts:

and of the above mentioned lautrup-nakanishi multipliers:

c  (c1, c2, c3) ,

c  (c1, c2, c3) ,

b  (b1, b2, b3) .

(2.3)

(2.4)

the model is assumed to be invariant under background eld gauge transformations. an in-
nitesimal background eld gauge transformation is dened by:

w  = i

w  = i

g
2
g
2

   ( + v) ,
   ( + v) ,

w a = a ,
w v  = v  ,

(2.5)

where the nablas label covariant derivatives whose indices indicate the corresponding connections
and:

v =

1

2  0

v ! ,

(2.6)

is the vacuum expectation value of the scalar eld . the second main symmetry property of
our model is brs invariance. in particular the classical action is assumed to be invariant under

6

the system of transformations:

sa = ac ,

s = i

g
2

c   ( + v) ,

sc =

g
2

c  c ,

s c = b ,

s b = 0 .

(2.7)

these transformations commute with the background gauge transformations. as shown by
grassi [10] it is convenient to extend to the background elds the action of brs transformations
introducing a set of anticommuting external elds:

 =

and dening:

1

2   2 + i1

4  i3 ! ,   (1

, 2

, 3

) ,

sv  =  ,

s =  ,

s  = 0 ,

s = 0 .

(2.8)

(2.9)

brs transformations, being non-linear, transform the elementary elds into composite operators;
in the functional framework these operators are coupled to external elds, that in the recent
literature are called anti-elds, and appear in the functional form of the slavnov-taylor identity.
in our case there are anti-elds corresponding to a ,  and c , they are:

a

  (cid:16)a

,1, a

,2, a

,3(cid:17) ,  

1

2  

2  i
1
4 + i


3 ! ,

e c  (c

1, c

2, c

3) .

the action of the model is given by

0 = z (linv + lg.f. + l. + ls.t.) .

(2.10)

(2.11)

the rst term under integral is the well known gauge invariant lagrangian density of the su (2)
higgs model [9], the second is the gauge xing term:

lg.f. = bv (a  v ) +

g
2

bhi(cid:16) + v(cid:17)  ( + v) + h.c.i +

b2
2

,

(2.12)

and the third is the faddeev-popov term; the last term denes the brs transformed elds
through their anti-eld couplings:

ls.t. = aa c  i(cid:20) g

2

 ( + v)  h.c.(cid:21) c  c g

2

c  c .

(2.13)

we shall not discuss here the technical aspects of the renormalization of our model since this
is a fairly well known subject that the introduction of the background eld does not change

7

substantially [10]. we assume therefore that the model be quantized respecting all the symme-
tries of the classical action; this implies, rst of all, that the connected functional satises the
slavnov-taylor identity:

szc = z "j 



a


+ ji



i

+ 


c  



j b

+ 



v 

+ i



i# zc = 0 ,

(2.14)

where the functional variables j , j, j b,  and  are the classical sources of the quantized
elds a ,  , b , c and c .

the invariance under the background gauge transformations (2.5) induces the ward identity

w zc = 0 ,

(2.15)

where w is the dierential operator generating the transformations (2.5). since these gauge
transformations commute with brs ones, one has:

[w ,s] = 0 .

(2.16)

the gauge-xing term (1.2) is linear, in the sense that the auxiliary eld b multiplies an operator
linear in the quantized elds. in these conditions the auxiliary eld equation is a linear equation
in the quantized elds. therefore this equation can be translated into a linear functional dier-
ential equation for zc, that survives renormalization. in fact this equation is a renormalization
prescription for our model and is written in the form:

j b = v  zc

j   v ! +

g

2 "i(cid:16) + v(cid:17)    zc

j

+ v! + h.c.# +

1


zc
j b

.

(2.17)

combining this identity with the slavnov-taylor identity yields to a further relation which is
the brs transformed of (2.17):

 = v

2 " i

2(cid:16) + v(cid:17)

(2.18)

the equations (2.14), (2.15), (2.17) and (2.18) give a system of functional dierential constraints
implementing the relevant symmetry properties of the fully quantized version of our model. they
can be translated into a corresponding system of functional dierential equations for the eective
action . in particular from (2.17) and (2.18) one has:


b

= v (a  v ) +

g

2 hi(cid:16) + v(cid:17)  ( + v) + h.c.i +

 ( + v) + h.c.(cid:21) .

(2.20)

from these equations one can extract some interesting information on . indeed the general
solution to the system (2.19), (2.20) has the following form:



where:

we can now discuss the parametrization of our . considering the reparametrizations leaving

(2.25)

(2.26)

since the theory is renormalizable it is easy to verify that, once the parameters in (2.25) have been
xed, one is left with a single free parameter corresponding to the 4 coupling in the invariant
lagrangian. therefore, taking also into account the parameters appearing in the gauge-xing,
one sees that the theory is identied by the dimensionless parameters

 ,  , g ,  , k , l , zc , z ,

(2.27)

and by v . these parameters must be xed by the normalization conditions.

it is apparent from (2.25) that neither a nor  are multiplicatively renormalized, while
q  a  v and q     are. it is well known that q and q are the natural dynamical
variables of the quantized theory and, in fact, all the papers based on the background eld
method choose the q-framework, that is the natural dynamical variables q and q [1].

however, as discussed in the introduction, the basic argument in favour of the background
gauge equivalence, that we consider in the present paper, relies on the fact that, choosing the
dynamical variables a and , the background elds become gauge artifacts.

then the question arises about the equivalence of the q- and a-frameworks. to answer this
question the rst point to be claried is that, at least in perturbation theory, the eective action
is a formal power series in both quantum and background elds. indeed the basic idea of the
background method is to compute the amplitudes with only background external legs, where
the quantum elds ( q and  ) contribute to the internal propagators. these amplitudes are
power series in the background elds whose coecients correspond to the eective vertices.

in the functional framework feynman amplitudes are obtained renormalizing the feynman
vacuum functional whose functional integral expression accounts for the diagrammatic structure
if z q is the vacuum functional in the q-framework and z a that in the
of the amplitudes.
a-framework, at the formal level of the unrenormalized feynman formula, it is clear that these
functionals are related by:

z a [j, . . .] = eir (jv+...)z q [j, . . .] .

(2.28)

since the bare actions of both frameworks coincide. it remains to verify what happens after
renormalization.

as discussed before, to renormalize our model corresponds to implement the symmetry
constraints that are written in the form: (2.14), (2.15), (2.17) and (2.18) in the a-framework
and can be easily translated into the form suitable for the q-framework.
it is also easy to
verify that these constraints are compatible with (2.28). once the symmetry constraints are
implemented, two dierent renormalization schemes dier in the parametrization; that is, they
correspond to dierent choices of the free parameters listed in (2.27). this means that, given z q,
(2.28) denes a z a corresponding to a particular choice of the parameters in the a-framework;
in other words (2.28) denes a one-to-one correspondence between the renormalized functional
of each framework, proving their equivalence.

10

to complete the analysis of the su (2) higgs-model we identify a system of normalization
2
|=0  , we assign the

conditions xing the free parameters. assuming the notation:
following wave function normalizations, masses and couplings:

,
qq(q2 = m2
,
qq (q2 = m2

q) = 0 , q q (q2 = m 2) = 0 , cc(q2 = m2

) = 0 ,

q) = g , 

q q (q2 = m 2) = 1 , 

) = 1 ,

cc(q2 = m2
) = gph m2

mq


qq(m 2, m2

q, m2

q) = gphmqg , cc(0, m2

 , m2

.

(2.29)

to avoid double poles in the propagators ([7], [11]) we also assume the condition (t hooft):

qlbb + bb


ql(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)q2=m2



= 0 .

(2.30)

one can verify that the normalization conditions in (2.29) determine the free parameters (2.27)
and v ; in particular one has, up to one loop corrections:

g = gph(1 + o(h)) ,

one has also:

in appendix a we list the propagators of our model.

3. the physical variables

having specied the reference gauge model, we must discuss briey its physical content; that

is the physical operators relevant for the construction of the s-matrix.

first of all, the physical asymptotic elds correspond to the transverse components of the
vector eld and to the higgs eld ; then we must consider the composite physical operators.
we do not need a complete list of these operators; we simply mention an example: the energy

11

momentum tensor. we associate with every physical operator a corresponding functional vari-
able that is identied, in the case of composite operators, with the  ph external elds appearing
in the introduction, and, in the case of asymptotic elds, with jph in eq.(1.5).

in a general gauge theory one denes a physical variable () as a functional variable with
vanishing faddeev-popov charge, that is coupled to a brs-invariant operator that does not
correspond to the brs-variation of any other operator. in formulae  is a physical variable if
and only if:

and

(cid:20) 



,s(cid:21) = 0


 6= {


x

,s} .

(3.1)

(3.2)

notice that the second condition (3.2) is crucial; indeed, for example, the source of the auxiliary
eld j b and the background eld v  satisfy (3.1), however one has:



j b

= (cid:26) 



,s(cid:27) ,



v 

= ( 



,s) ,

and hence these variables are physically trivial.

notice also that the actually independent asymptotic variables are the components of f ph
dened in (1.5); we should therefore use z 1k + f ph instead of jph. for simplicity we prefer
to use jph understanding its dependence on f ph; however taking functional derivatives we have
to refer to f ph using:



f ph = z 1k  + 


j

.

to simplify the notation in the rest of the paper we shall use the following symbols:

j  j b ,   ( , ) ,
b  b ,

j  (j  , j) ,
  (a , ) , v  (v  , ) ,
  (cid:16)a

, (cid:17) .

with these new symbols the slavnov-taylor identity (2.14) becomes

szc  z (cid:18)j



 + 


c

+ 



v (cid:19) zc = 0 ,

(3.3)

4. the eective action and the background equivalence theorem

we begin dening the eective action upon which background gauge equivalence is based.

since we are interested in the physical restriction of the s-matrix, the ghost propagator does

not appear. then we restrict our functional variables setting:

 =  = c =  =  = c = c = 0 .

after this restriction the eective action, given in (2.21), becomes:

 [, v, b] =  [, v ] + gf [, b, v ] ,

where gf contains the bosonic part of the gauge xing term; in the reference model:

gf = z "bv (a  v ) +

g
2

bhi(cid:16) + v(cid:17)  ( + v) + h.c.i +

b2

2# .

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

it is a crucial and general fact that the dependence of  on b is restricted to gf .

to simplify further our notation we shall understand the dependence of the connected func-
tionals and eective actions on the physical variables  ph, corresponding to physical composite
operators, and we concentrate on the asymptotic physical variables jph. notice that these vari-
ables appear in the connected functional zc but not in .

now we come to the main subject of this paper: the proof of background equivalence following
the lines presented in the introduction. as already discussed, we must compare the connected
s-matrix corresponding to the eective action (4.2) that is by no means invariant under gauge
transformations of  and b at v = 0 , with that corresponding to the alternative eective action:

ef f [] =  [, ] + gf [, b, 0] ,


(4.4)

which identies our prescription for the gauge-xed, gauge-invariant, eective action (1.16). we
call this eective action gauge invariant since its gauge invariance is only broken by the gauge
xing term ((4.3) at v = 0) that is by the choice of the propagators. indeed  [, ] is gauge
invariant owing to (2.24). the connected functional of our model is identied with the solution
to:

zc [j, j, v ]

zc [j, j, v ] , v(cid:21)

j

= (cid:20) 
gf (cid:20) 

j

zc [j, j, v ] ,

but not gauge independent! [3]


j

zc [j, j, v ] , v(cid:21) +z (cid:18)j


j

+ j



j(cid:19) zc [j, j, v ] , (4.5)

vanishing in the origin of the functional variable space; while that corresponding to the gauge
invariant eective action (4.4) is identied with:

zc [j, j, v ]

j

= (cid:20) 
+z (cid:18)j


j

zc [j, j, v ] , v +


j

zc [j, j, v ](cid:21)  gf (cid:20) 

j

zc [j, j, v ] ,


j

zc [j, j, v ] , 0(cid:21)

+ j



j(cid:19) zc [j, j, v ] ,

(4.6)

the corresponding connected s-matrices are given by zchjph, 0, 0i and zchjph, 0, 0i .

for background equivalence to hold true they should coincide.
to prove this, we introduce a further connected functional zc depending on two background

elds v and w ; zc is dened by:

zc [j, j, v, w ]

j

= (cid:20) 
+z (cid:18)j


j

zc [j, j, v, w ] , v(cid:21)  gf (cid:20) 
j(cid:19) zc [j, j, v, w ] .

+ j



j

zc [j, j, v, w ] ,


j

zc [j, j, v, w ] , w(cid:21)

(4.7)

we shall use zc to verify the dependence of zc on the background eld appearing in gf . it is
obvious that:

taking the -derivative of (3.5) in the point specied by (4.1) and j = jph, we have:

zc [j, j, v, v ] = zc [j, j, v ] .


v

zchjph, j, vi = (cid:18) 

v

+



w(cid:19) zchjph, j, v, vi = 0 ,

since f ph satises (3.1). taking the  derivative in the same conditions, we have:


j

zchjph, j, vi =


j

zchjph, j, v, vi = 0 .

using (1.3) we have:

(4.8)

(4.9)

(4.10)


w

zc [j, j, v, w ] = 


w

gf (cid:20) 

j

zc [j, j, v, w ] ,


j

zc [j, j, v, w ] , w(cid:21) .

(4.11)

the right-hand side of (4.11) can be easily computed taking into account the explicit form of
gf given in (4.3). we exploit in particular the fact that the background functional derivative
of gf is linear in the eld b :


v

gf [, b, v ] = l [, v ] b ,

(4.12)

14

combining (4.11) and (4.12), written as a functional dierential equation for zc, we get:


w

zc [j, j, v, w ] = l(cid:20) 

j

zc [j, j, v, w ] , w(cid:21) 

j

zc [j, j, v, w ] .

(4.13)

then starting from (4.10) and taking multiple j and w derivatives of (4.13) one nds recursively
that:

(4.14)

(4.15)

w(cid:19)n
(cid:18) 

zchjph, j, v, vi = 0 ,

for any n. a more detailed analysis of this point is given in appendix b.

from (4.9) and (4.10) (see appendix b), one nds that:

zchjph, j, v, wi  zchjph, j, vi  zchjph, 0, 0i .

that is: the s-matrices corresponding to zc and zc coincide.

now we compare the functional zc with zc. setting j = jph and j = 0 and applying (1.2)

one nds:

(cid:18) 



zchjph, 0, vi , v +






+

j

v (cid:19) (cid:20) 
gf (cid:20)

j

zchjph, 0, vi(cid:21)
zchjph, 0, vi , 0(cid:21) = jph ,
zchjph, 0, vi , 0(cid:21) = 0 .

+


b

(4.16)

as mentioned in the introduction, this system determines 
j
uniquely.

zchjph, 0, vi and 

j

zchjph, 0, vi

one has furthermore from (1.3):


v

zchjph, 0, vi = 


v

(cid:20) 

j

zchjph, 0, vi , v +


j

zchjph, 0, vi(cid:21) .

(4.17)

in much the same way, considering zc one has:

b




j

(cid:20) 
gf (cid:20) 
gf (cid:20)

j

zchjph, 0, v, 0i , 0(cid:21) = jph ,
zchjph, 0, v, 0i , 0(cid:21) = 0 ,

(4.18)

that determine 
j

furthermore from (4.15) and (1.3) one has:

zchjph, 0, v, 0i and 

j

zchjph, 0, v, 0i uniquely.


v

zchjph, 0, v, 0i = 


v

(cid:20) 

j

zchjph, 0, v, 0i , v(cid:21) = 0 .

to compare zc and zc we consider the following system of functional equations:

hjph, vi
hjph, vi

=

=


j


j

zchjph, 0, v + hjph, vi , 0i ,
zchjph, 0, v + hjph, vi , 0i .

(4.19)

(4.20)

it is rather apparent that the iterative solution to (4.20) leads to a unique solution ( , ). a
detailed analysis supporting this conclusion is given in appendix b.

therefore if we replace v  v +  everywhere into the system (4.18), on account of (4.20),

we get:

 [, v + ] +




gf [, , 0] = jph ,

gf [, , 0] = 0 .




b

furthermore the same substitution into (4.19) gives:


v

 [, v + ] = 0 .

owing to (4.22) we see that (4.21) is equivalent to :

(cid:18) 



+



v (cid:19)  [, v + ] +




gf [, , 0] = jph ,


b

gf [, , 0] = 0 .

(4.21)

(4.22)

(4.23)

since this system identies uniquely its solution ( ,  ), comparing (4.23) with (4.16), we have:

hjph, vi =

hjph, vi =


j


j

zchjph, 0, vi =


j

zchjph, 0, v + hjph, vi , 0i ,

zchjph, 0, vi =


j

zchjph, 0, v + hjph, vi , 0i .

(4.24)

(4.25)

16

if, using (3.3), we restrict the j-functional derivatives in (4.24) to the physical shell and we take

into account the v -independence of zchjph, 0, v, 0i shown in (4.15), we get:



f ph

zchjph, 0, vi

 z 1k  + 


j

zchjph, 0, vi =



f ph

=



f ph

zchjph, 0, 0, 0i .

zchjph, 0, v + hjph, vi , 0i

(4.26)

excluding the physical composite operators ( ph = 0), the last identity can be integrated over
f ph with the initial condition: zc [0, 0, 0, 0] = zc [0, 0, 0] = 0 ensuring, on account of (4.15), the
identity of the connected s-matrices:

zchjph, 0, 0i = zchjph, 0, 0, 0i = zchjph, 0, 0i ,

(4.27)

and hence proving the background equivalence of the s-matrix elements. it is however possible
to extend this results to the matrix elements between physical asymptotic states of t-ordered
products of physical operators, proving that zc [0, 0, 0, 0] = zc [0, 0, 0] for any choice of  ph.

this is easily done using (1.3), (4.24) and (4.25). indeed, applying (1.3) to zc and zc, we

get for jph = j = 0 :




zc [0, 0, v ]

= 





j




(cid:20) 
gf (cid:20) 

j

zc [0, 0, v ] , v +

zc [0, 0, v ] ,


j


j

zc [0, 0, v ](cid:21)
zc [0, 0, v ] , 0(cid:21) ,

(4.28)

and:




zc [0, 0, v, 0]

= 





j




(cid:20) 
gf (cid:20) 

j

zc [0, 0, v, 0] , v(cid:21)

zc [0, 0, v, 0] ,


j

zc [0, 0, v, 0] , 0(cid:21) .

(4.29)

zc [0, 0, v ], the left-hand side does not change, owing to
if we replace in (4.29) : v  v + 
(4.19), and, on account of (4.24) and (4.25), the right-hand side becomes equal to that of (4.28).
we thus conclude that:

j







zc [0, 0, v ] =

zc [0, 0, v, 0] .

(4.30)

integrating with respect to  with the initial condition: zc [0, 0, 0, 0] = zc [0, 0, 0] = 0, we prove

the identity: zchjph, 0, 0, 0i = zchjph, 0, 0i, and hence (4.27) for any  ph.

5. comments

we stress, rst of all, that our proof is based on the existence of a fully renormalized theory
satisfying a set of renormalization prescriptions ((2.14), (2.15), (2.17) and (2.18)); the only ex-
plicit references to the perturbative construction concern the reference model and the discussion
of the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the system (4.20).

the use of the simplied symbols introduced in (3.4) should put into evidence the general
nature of our proof. indeed the essential ingredients of the analysis can be divided into two sets:
the basic, physical, ingredient is slavnov-taylor identity (3.5) ensuring that the background eld
and the auxiliary eld are gauge artifacts and have no inuence on the physical amplitudes. the
second, technical, ingredient is the linear gauge choice, that has allowed us to separate from the
eective action the gauge xing part (see (2.11), (2.12) and (2.21)) guaranteing in particular the
property (4.12). of course everything is based on the systematic use of the functional framework
and in particular on (1.2) and (1.3) whose validity is completely general.

therefore it should be clear that our proof extends directly to any gauge model, provided
one can dene the asymptotic elds and hence the s-matrix. in fact, in the models in which
the gauge group contains abelian invariant factors there are further constraints that are conve-
niently introduced to guarantee the radiative stability of abelian charges ([12] and [13]). these
constraints, that correspond to the prescription of the eld equations of the abelian anti-ghosts,
further specify the gauge xing prescription without any interference with the ingredients of our
proof.

a further point that requires a short discussion concerns the dependence of the gauge in-
variant eective theory on the gauge xing prescription. first of all, we should notice that our
construction is based on two, in principle independent, gauge xing procedures. the rst quan-
tum gauge xing is needed to compute from the lagrangian the eective action, the second one
allows the construction of the s-matrix from the eective action. it has been convenient for us
to identify these gauge xings, since we had to compare the s-matrix of the eective theory to
that obtained directly from the theory in a trivial background. however it is fairly well known
that, once a gauge invariant eective action is given, the s-matrix is independent of the gauge
xing necessary to dene the eective theory propagators. it is also independent of the rst,
quantum, gauge xing, since this is true for the theory in a trivial background [7], however, it is
known that the gauge invariant eective action is not [3]. this could appear a little paradoxical,
since one could think that all the parameters appearing into a gauge invariant eective action
should carry an independent physical information, but it is easy to show that this is not true,
and there is wide room to change the gauge invariant eective couplings that are proportional to
the eld equations, thus keeping the s-matrix xed. concerning the parametrization of gauge
eective actions see also [14].

the existence of two distinct gauge xings justies the introduction of the interpolating functional zc depending

on two background elds v and w .

appendix b

we begin this appendix considering (4.9) , (4.10) and (4.13) and proving recursively (4.14)

for any n.

first of all, from (4.10) and (4.13) we have:


w

zchjph, j, v, vi = 0 .

let us assume (4.14) to hold true for any n  m  1, up to order m  1 we have:



j (cid:18) 

w(cid:19)n

zchjph, j, v, vi = 0 .

19

(b.1)

(b.2)

we can compute the mth w -derivative of zchjph, j, v, wi for v = w taking the (m  1)th

w -derivative of both sides of (4.13) and putting w = v . the right-hand side of the resulting
equation is the sum of many terms, each proportional to a derivative (b.2) with n < m, therefore
it vanishes and hence (4.14) holds true for any n.

expanding this functional around v = w , and using (4.14), we see that it is independent of

we notice furthermore that zchjph, j, v, wi is independent of v and w . indeed, taylor
w . then, on account of (4.8), it coincides with zchjph, j, vi which, according to (4.9), is

v -independent. thus we have proved (4.15)

now we consider the system (4.20). for our purposes it is sucient to study the iterative
solutions of this system that are formal power series in v and jph, since the physical amplitudes,
that we are considering, are identied with the coecients of an analogous series. the iterative
solution of (4.20) is built developing the right-hand side of this equation in series of  getting:

hjph, vi (x) =
+z dy

2

j(x)v (y)



j(x)

zchjph, 0, v, 0i
zchjph, 0, v, 0i [jph, v ](y) + o(cid:16) 2(cid:17) ,

that can be written in the form:

z dy"(x  y) 

2

j(x)v (y)

zchjph, 0, v, 0i# [jph, v ](y)

=



j(x)

zchjph, 0, v, 0i + o(cid:16) 2(cid:17) .

now it is clear that (4.20) is solvable provided the matrix

(x  y) 

2

j(x)v (y)

zchjph, 0, v, 0i ,

(b.3)

(b.4)

(b.5)

be non-degenerate at v = 0 . this is certainly true in perturbation theory, since the second
term in the left-hand side of (b.4) vanishes in the tree approximation. indeed, owing to (1.3)
and (4.7) ,
the classical action deprived of the gauge xing part, that is independent of v .

 and  in the tree approximation reduces to r linv,

zc can be computed from 
v


v

it is also clear that, the -component of the solution of (4.20) identies uniquely the -

component. thus, at least perturbatively, the system (4.20) has a unique solution.
