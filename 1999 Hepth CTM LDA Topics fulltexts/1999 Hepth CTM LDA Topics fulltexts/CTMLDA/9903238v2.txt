we examine the recently proposed technique of adding boundary counterterms to the gravita-
tional action for spacetimes which are locally asymptotic to antide sitter. in particular, we explic-
itly identify higher order counterterms, which allow us to consider spacetimes of dimensions d  7.
as the counterterms eliminate the need of background subtraction in calculating the action, we
apply this technique to study examples where the appropriate background was ambiguous or un-
known: topological black holes, taubnutads and taubboltads. we also identify certain cases
where the covariant counterterms fail to render the action nite, and we comment on the dual eld
theory interpretation of this result. in some examples, the case of vanishing cosmological constant
may be recovered in a limit, which allows us to check results and resolve ambiguities in certain
asymptotically at spacetime computations in the literature.

i. introduction

the ads/cft correspondence asserts that there is an equivalence between a gravitational theory in d-dimensional
antide sitter (ads) space and a conformal eld theory (cft) living in a (d1)dimensional boundary space [1].
this equivalence or duality is best understood in the context of string theory with d=5, where the duality relates
type iib superstring theory on ads5s5, and n =4 supersymmetric yangmills theory with gauge group su (n ) in
four dimensions [2,3]. the precise formulation of the ads/cft correspondence is made by equating the partition
functions of the two theories:

zads(0,i) = zcf t (0,i) .

(1)

here the elds 0,i have two interpretations: on the gravity side, these elds correspond to the boundary data or
boundary values (up to a certain rescaling [1]) for the bulk elds i which propagate in the ads space. on the eld
theory side, these elds correspond to external source currents coupled to various cft operators. thus correlation
functions of the operators in the cft can be determined through a calculation using the dynamics of gravity in
ads space [1,3].
in certain instances, one can consider evaluating the ads partition function in a saddlepoint
approximation:

eiads(i) =der 0,ioiecf t

(2)

where iads(i) is the classical gravitational action as a functional of the (super)gravity elds, and oi are the dual
cft operators. hence in this approximation, the ads action becomes the generating function of the connected
correlation functions in the cft [1,3]. this framework is also naturally extended to considering cft states for which
certain operators acquire expectation values by considering solutions of the gravitational equations which are only
asymptotically ads [4,5].

one aspect of the duality which will be interesting for the present investigation is the choice of the background
metric ij required to dene the eld theory. this metric is related by an innite conformal transformation to the
induced metric hij on the boundary of the ads space [1]. since the boundary conformal transformation is divergent,

1

one regularizes the calculation by considering the induced metric for a family of surfaces which approach the boundary
in a limit. this regularization procedure then will depend on the choices of coordinates in the asymptotic ads region,
i.e., it depends on the precise family of surfaces chosen. with dierent choices then, the background geometry
inherited by the cft takes a completely dierent form. for example, depending on the choice of radial slicing for
adsn+1, the boundary geometry can be s1sn, sn+1, s1irn. we will discuss these and other possibilities in
section ii. this procedure therefore allows one to study the cft with dierent background geometries. from the
point of view of the gravity theory, this procedure is interesting because naively the expressions on the left-hand side
of eqns. (1) and (2) are coordinate invariant. however, the asymptotic regularization explicitly breaks this covariance.
returning to eqn. (2), considering the gravitational path integral in the saddle-point approximation has a long
history in the quantum gravity literature, in particular in context of black hole thermodynamics [6]  see refs. [7]
and [8] for discussions relevant for ads. there is a problem that must be faced with this approach in that typically
the gravity action diverges. for d = n+1 spacetime dimensions, the familiar (euclidean) action has two contributions

the rst term is just the einsteinhilbertantidesitter action with cosmological constant = n(n1)
. the second
integral is the gibbonshawking boundary term which is required so that upon variation with metric xed at the
boundary, the action yields the einstein equations [6]. here, k is the trace of the extrinsic curvature of the boundary
m as embedded in m. in the ads context, both of these expressions are divergent because the volumes of both
m and m are innite (and the integrands are nonzero). the traditional approach to circumvent this problem
is to perform a background subtraction. that is, one produces a nite result by subtracting from eqn. (3) the
contribution of a background reference spacetime, so that one can compare the properties of the solution of interest
relative to those of the reference state. note, however, that this subtraction requires that the asymptotic boundary
geometries of the two solutions can be matched in order to render the surface contribution nite.1 aside from being
a technical nuisance, there are certain cases where an appropriate reference solution is ambiguous or unknown, e.g.,
topological black holes [913], and taubnutads and taubboltads [14,15]  see discussion below.

2l2

in the context of the ads/cft correspondence, there does not seem to be room for a background subtraction in, for
example, eqn.(2). remarkably ads space oers an alternative approach! the divergences that arise in eqn. (3) are all
proportional to local integrals of the background cft metric ij [1,16]. thus these divergences can be eliminated by
extending the regularization procedure for the action with a counterterm subtraction. that is eqn. (3) is modied
to include the subtraction of a nite set of boundary integrals (with divergent coecients) involving curvature scalars
constructed from the background metric ij [17]. recently a remarkable insight was provided by ref. [18] (see also
ref. [19]): if the counterterms are expressed in terms of the induced metric hij, rather than ij , then they naturally
appear with the appropriate divergences as the volume of the regulator surface grows as it approaches the boundary of
ads. thus in the counterterm subtraction approach, one may produce a nite gravitational action by supplementing
the contributions in eqn. (3) with an extra surface integral

ict =

8gzm

dnxh f (l,r,r) ,

(4)

where the counterterms depend only on the curvature r (and its derivatives) of the induced boundary metric hij 
see section iii for explicit expressions. that this construction is unique to asymptotically ads spaces is apparent
because the ads curvature scale l is essential in dening the counterterms. note that these expressions are universal
depending only on l and the spacetime dimension. once these are xed, one may use the same counterterms to
regulate the action for any choice of coordinates on any asymptotically ads solution.2

even outside of the ads/cft correspondence, counterterm subtraction provides a remarkable new theoretical tool
with which to investigate gravitational physics. together eqns. (3) and (4) provide a nite covariant denition of the
gravitational action for asymptotically ads spaces. as a simple example, one might consider the energy of a gravitating
system in ads space. traditionally the denition of energy in gravity required a background reference solution in
asymptotically ads spaces [8,20], just as in asymptotically at spaces [21]. combined the quasilocal formulation of
brown and york [22], the ads action with counterterms provides a denition of energy that is independent of any

reference solution [18]. using this technique, one discovers a nite energy for ads5 with an irs3 boundary. in the
context of the ads/cft correspondence, one can interpret this energy as the casimir energy of the dual eld theory
in the latter background geometry [18]. a similar casimir energy arises in ads3 [18], where there is a well known
dierence between the energy m =  1/(8g) of global ads3 and that of the m =0 state (which is only locally ads3).
thus one might revisit euclidean quantum gravity with this new theoretical tool in hand. in particular, one can
address the cases where the background subtraction technique was not possible or (due to ambiguiuties) the results
were disputed. this is one of the primary objectives of the current investigation.

the issue of the correct reference state has been disputed for topological black holes [913], in particular for the
hyperbolic ads black holes. the latter are black hole solutions where the horizon is a hyperbolic space h n instead
of a sphere. as it happens, there is among these solutions one which is locally (though not globally) equal to ads.
however, in order for it to be regular, the euclidean time has to take a xed nite value  in other words, it is a nite
temperature solution. as such, it is not an adequate reference state for matching calculations, which would require a
solution that admits arbitrary euclidean period. in section iv, we apply the counterterm subtraction prescription to
compute the action, and discover some intriguing results. we are led to speculate on a connection to the precusor
states recently discussed in ref. [30].

the taubnut solution is known to admit an extension to include a cosmological constant [23], and as such, the
taubnutantidesitter (tnads) solution has been studied recently in refs. [14,15]. the boundary geometry can
not be matched to that of ads space, and so there is no known reference solution with which to make a background
subtraction.
instead in refs. [14,15], the analog of the selfdual tn solution (i.e., the one with a nut, a zero
dimensional xed point set, at its origin) was used as the reference state in a background subtraction calculation of
the action of the taubboltantidesitter (tbads) solution. in section v, we use the counterterm subtraction for
a backgroundless calculation of the action of tnads. this allows us to study the thermodynamics of this solution
in and of itself. in particular, we can study its local intrinsic stability, and nd its entropy, as a function of the nut
charge. this leads to some surprises.

as mentioned above, the counterterm subtraction approach can not be extended in a straightforward way to
asymptotically at (af) spacetimes (and for that matter, to spacetimes which do not asymptote to ads) because the
ads scale is an essential ingredient in the denition of the counterterms (4). however, one can apply this technique
in a casebycase manner to the computation of the action of those asymptotically at solutions which can obtained
as limits of ads solutions. a simple example is the computation of the action of the schwarzschild solution by
rst embedding it in ads. there exists a schwarzschildads solution [7]  discussed extensively in the context of
the ads/cft correspondence recently [1,4]  which for black holes that are much smaller than the cosmological
length scale l||1/2 approximates the asymptotically at schwarzschild solution. we can compute the action of
this schwarzschildads black hole by using the counterterm prescription, and then take the limit l. in this way
we almost recover the standard result that is obtained by matching the af solution to minkowski spacetime.

the preceding is a satisfying, but somewhat trivial example. however, there are other cases of af spaces where
the computation of the action, using the more traditional background subtraction technique, has been the subject
of some controversy. one such case is that of the taubnut solutions, which are only asymptotically locally at
(alf). in ref. [25] the action of generic euclidean taubnut solutions (of which only the selfdual taubnut and
taubbolt instantons are regular) was computed by trying to match the solutions to minkowski space, in order to
perform a regularizing subtraction. however, since the large radius slices of euclidean taubnut space are squashed
threespheres, in contrast to the minkowskian slices s1s2, the matching is not really well dened. therefore, it
was proposed in ref. [24] that the proper background to be subtracted is instead the selfdual taubnut instanton,
which has the lowest possible energy among the regular euclidean taubnut solutionsthe only other regular
solution is the taubbolt instanton3. it was noticed in ref. [14] that there existed a branch of solutions which tends
to the alf taubnut solution as l. (these are the analogue of the small schwarzschild black hole branch
of solutions on ref. [7].) therefore, after applying the counterterm subtraction procedure to compute the action of
the asymptotically tnads solution, we take the limit l. this limit provides then a background independent
result for the action of the alf taubnut solutions. remarkably, we nd that the result agrees precisely with the
one given in [24]. furthermore, we show that the counterterm prescription results are reproduced by performing an
imperfect matching to ads similar to the one in the alf case.

a simple application of the counterterm subtraction is to calculate the action of (euclidean) adsn+1 for dierent

3some care should be exercised, since often in the literature the name taubnut solution is used to refer specically to
the selfdual taubnut instanton, instead of the full, twoparameter taubnut solution.

choices of coordinates, i.e., with dierent boundary geometries. in section vi, we present an extensive analysis of
the multislicing phenomenon for (euclidean) adsn+1 with n4, showing the results for the action in each case. it
is interesting to note the appearance of dierent casimir energy in dierent cases. a more dramatic result is that
for certain boundary geometries, such as sn and h n, one nds that the counterterm subtraction is insucient. that
is a divergence that is logarithmic in the asymptotic radius appears, and can not be eliminated by the addition of
a local counterterm as in eqn. (4). these divergences which can arise for even n have been noted previously in the
context of the ads/cft correspondence [1,17]. there they may be related to a conformal anomaly for the dual cft
in certain background geometries which is well known to be connected to the appearance of logarithmic divergences
in the eective eld theory action [26]. of course, this presents a limitation on counterterm subtraction as a general
tool to investigate asymptotically ads spaces in odd spacetime dimensions.

certainly our results have many interesting implications for the dual eld theory via the ads/cft correspondence.
we will only make limited comments on this aspect of the work here, leaving a more general study of the eld theoretic
interpretation for a future paper.

while this work was being completed, we were informed that r. mann [27] had also considered the application of

the ads action with counterterms to the solutions considered in sections iv and v.

ii. the many faces of ads

as described in the previous section, counterterm subtraction works by subtracting the integral of various boundary
curvature invariants (4) from the standard action (3). this leaves unspecied the way in which the boundary of ads
is approached, i.e., the choice of radial coordinate dening the family of surfaces which approach the boundary as
a limit. depending on this choice, the slices at constant radius can have dierent geometry or even dierent topology.
even if the spaces are locally equivalent to one another, the computation of the action will in general lead to dierent
results, since the boundary terms in the action will take dierent values. in the end, since all dierent forms of a
spacetime will be related by dieomorphisms, with possible addition or subtraction of points, and possibly as well,
identications under discrete subgroups, the dierent results for the action will bear a relation to one another, too.
here we will describe some of the many possible faces of the boundary of ads. in subsequent sections, we will
consider these metrics as examples for the application of the counterterm subtraction technique, and compare the
results. clearly, such a comparison would have been impossible had we required a background for the calculation.

let us rst present euclidean adsn+1 in the following three familiar metrics,

r2

l2(cid:19) d 2 +
ds2 =(cid:18)k +

k,n1 =

n1 is the unit metric on sn1. by h n1 we mean the (n1)dimensional hyperbolic space, whose unit
where d2
n1 can be obtained by analytic continuation of that on sn1. it is straightforward to see that all of the
metric d2
above solutions are locally equivalent to each other. in the above we are assuming that n>2 for k=1, since for n=2
one does not have a hyperbolic metric h 1.
k,n as lnk,n. in this way, k=+1,n will be equal

for later use in the paper, we will write the volume of the space d2

to the volume n of the unit nsphere.

where the ndimensional metric d2
k,n is dened precisely in the same way as above in eqn. (6). for k=0, this simply

metrics into the form

where again the metrics db2
k, m are dened in eqn. (6). for k = 0 we once again reproduce the k = 0
metric in eqn. (5). for k = 1, we assume that both m, m  2. for k = +1, the boundary geometry is h ms m, while
for k = 1, we simply interchange the hyperbolic space and the sphere. however, in the latter case, the coordinate
transformation r2 = r2  l2 puts the metric back in the k = +1 form with m m.
geometries:

thus with the metrics in eqns. (5), (7) and (10), we have displayed adsn+1 with a wide variety of boundary

irn, s1  sn1, s1  irn1, s1  h n1, sn, h n, sm  h nm .

all of these ads metrics are maximally symetric, i.e.,

rijkl = 

1
l2 (gik gjl  gil gjk) ,

(11)

(12)

which ensures that the geometry is conformally at. this condition also ensures the geometries are all locally ads.

it is interesting to notice the form of some of the boundary geometries we get here upon analytic continuation to

minkowski signature, since they are rather common :

sn : static euclidean de sitter space
h n : (global) anti  de sitter space
irn : minkowski space .

(13)

furthermore, if we assume a specic analytic continuation to lorentzian spacetime, e.g., s1sn  ir(time)sn,
then

ir  sn1
ir  h n1 : the static open universe .

: the einstein static universe

(14)

the ads/cft correspondence implies then an equivalence between, on the one hand, quantum gravity in ads and,
on the other hand, a cft on any of the above backgrounds. we nd it particularly amusing that, when the boundary
is taken to be h n, quantum gravity in adsn+1 can be dual to a cft on an adsn background! it should be kept in
mind that the geometry on the boundary is not dynamical, since there are no gravitational degrees of freedom in the
dual cft.

there is an important feature that distinguishes the solutions with k=1 from those with k=0, +1: there is a nite
minimum radius r=l at which grr diverges. in eqn. (5), the killing vector  also has xed point set (a bolt)
at this radius. in this case, the euclidean solution will be regular only if the coordinate  is identied with period
=2l. in the metric (7) with k=1, the minimum radius r=r+ simply denotes the boundary of a coordinate patch
as is evident from the form of the metric in eqn. (8) with the new radial coordinate . in the case of eqn. (10) with
k=1 r=r+ is the location of a conical singularity. for k=+1, the minimum radius is r=r+=0 and the geometry
is smooth at this point in metrics (5) and (7), but it corresponds to a conical singularity in eqn. (10). for k=0, the
minimum radius is again r=r+=0 which in this case is an innite proper distance away and so there is no problem
with the curvature here. note that the geometries with conical singularities or a bolt are only locally ads, that is
they describe ads spacetime with additional discrete identications of points.

eqn. (12) is an extremely restrictive condition. if one is simply interested in solving einsteins equations with a

negative cosmological constant

5

rij = 

n  2
l2 gij ,

(15)

then the above metrics remain solutions when the boundary geometries are replaced by arbitrary einstein spaces. in

all of the metrics (5,7,10), one may replace any of the sp factors (with p>1) by a space satisfying erab=(p  1)/l2 gab.
similarly any h p factors can be replaced by a space satisfying brab= (p 1)/l2 gab, and irp factors can be replaced by
any ricci at solution, i.e., rab=0. for example, then sp can be replaced by a product of spheres sp1spq where
pq
i =(p  1)/(pi  1) l2. these generalized
solutions will no longer be conformally at or locally ads. furthermore generically a true curvature singularity is
introduced at the minimum radius, e.g., rijklrijkl grows without bound as r approaches r+.

i=1 pi = p with pi > 2 and the radii of the individual spheres is scaled so r2

iii. counterterm action

the detailed form of the boundary counterterms was originally explored in ref. [17], where they were derived in
terms of the background (eld theory) metric ij . the insight provided by ref. [18] was that the counterterms should
be written in terms of the induced metric on the boundary hij. in this way, they naturally appear with the appropriate
(innite volume) divergences to cancel those arising from the classical gravitational action. the focus of ref. [18] was
to construct a nite boundary stress-tensor without using a reference background. however, the proposed prescription
naturally provides the construction of a nite action which can then be employed, for example, to calculate the action
of euclidean gravitational instantons. this will be the primary application which we consider in the following.

hence the full (euclidean) gravitational action in d = n+1 spacetime dimensions has three contributions

iads = ibulk(gij) + isurf (gij ) + ict(hij) .

(16)

the rst two terms, comprising the familiar classical action, were given in eqn. (3). here, hij is the induced metric
on the boundary m which may be dened as hij = gij  ninj where n is an outward pointing unit normal vector to
m. in the gibbons-hawking boundary term isurf , the trace of the extrinsic curvature is dened by k=hijinj.4
the counterterm action ict(hij) may be arranged as an expansion in powers of the boundary curvature (and its
derivatives). the number of terms that appears grows with the dimension of the spacetime. the rst few terms are
explicitly

ict =

2(n  4)(n  2)2(cid:18)rabrab 

n

4(n  1)r2(cid:19) + . . .(cid:21) ,

(17)

where r and rab are the ricci scalar and ricci tensor for the boundary metric, respectively. combined these three
counterterms are sucient5 to cancel divergences for n  6. in this covariant form, the rst term originally appeared
in ref. [19], while the second term rst appeared in ref. [18]. we derived the third term by demanding that the
innite volume divergences were cancelled when using the metric (10). any of these terms may be derived with the
construction provided by ref. [17] for the appropriate curvature integral in terms of the cft metric ij . one then
simply substitutes the induced boundary metric hij to produce the covariant counterterms appearing in ict. to go
to higher dimensions, resorting to this construction seems inescapable as the simple asymptotically ads metrics
presented in section ii can not be used to distinguish all of the curvature invariants that can appear in the higher
order counterterms. it is important to note that the fact that we have counterterms for dimensions up to d=7 means
that we can now study all (known) ads applications which arise in string theory and mtheory.

other matter eld actions, for example an action for maxwell elds, can be added to eqn. (16). although, at least
for black hole solutions, the addition of gauge elds does not seem to require new counterterms [29], we must remain
alert to the possibility that extra matter elds may require the addition of new, nongeometric surface counterterms
to the action. this issue will not be considered further here.

as a simple example, we will consider calculating the action (16) with the metric (5) for ads with boundary

s1mk. let us present the contributions of the individual terms in the action:

4our conventions dier by signs from refs. [18,22], but are chosen to conform with standard practice in general relativity, as

in, e.g., ref. [28].

as we have explained above, for k=+1, 0, we have  arbitrary and r+=0, whereas for k=1, r+=l and =2l.

note that for even n, the coecients of the higher counter terms are actually divergent, even though they formally
evaluate to a nite result. further in either of these results, eqns. (19) and (20), there are extra terms of order 1/r,
which then vanish when the limit r is to be taken to approach the ads boundary. however consider the case
of n odd, then we would have the option of in fact keeping all of the higher order counter terms in eqn. (17), i.e.,
including the terms which actually vanish in the boundary limit. this would give a result where in fact all of the
inverse powers rp would be cancelled so that not only would the action be nite, but it would be independent of the
regulator radius!

given the explicit counterterms in eqn. (17), we can only really evaluate the action for n6. however, keeping in
mind that the higher order counterterms ensure the cancellation of divergences order by order, it is clear that the
formulae (19) and (20) will be unchanged for n > 6. further we can show that the coecient of the extra contributions
for n even will be6

iv. ads black holes

in this section we turn to the study of black hole solutions, using the counterterm subtraction scheme.

in the
presence of a negative cosmological constant, the horizon of a black hole admits a much larger variety of geometries
and topologies than in asymptotically at situations. this is consistent with the variety of boundary topologies that
we can obtain for ads itself, depending upon how we choose to radially foliate it, as discussed in section ii. the
case (k=1 below) of spherical black holes has already been studied using this counterterm subtraction scheme in ref.
[18], but we compute and list those results in what follows for completeness and for comparison with the at and
hyperbolic cases.

in ref. [13] it was shown that the einsteinantidesitter system in n+1 dimensions admits the following solutions:

with

ds2 = vk(r)dt2 +

dr2
vk(r)

+

r2
l2 d2

k,n1 ,

vk(r) = k 


rn2 +

r2
l2 ,

(22)

(23)

k,n1 is dened as in eqn. (6). thus it represents sn1, irn1 and h n1 for
where the (n1) dimensional metric d2
k = +1, 0 and 1, respectively. a spacetime that is locally the same as antide sitter space is recovered when =0
for which the metric reduces to that in eqn. (5).

by going to the euclidean section one nds that the euclidean time period (the inverse temperature) has to be

 =

4l2r+
+ + k(n  2)l2 .

nr2

(24)

here, r+ is the largest positive root of v (r), typically associated to the outer horizon of a black hole. for k=1 and
=0 (global ads), there is no such root, but the correct results are obtained by setting r+=0. now, it is important
to notice that, whereas for k={1, 0}, the locally ads solution corresponds to r+=0, this is not true for k=  1. ads
space with hyperbolic slicing has a bifurcate killing horizon at r=l, and a xed temperature =2l. by contrast,
there exists an extremal k=1 solution, with a degenerate horizon at r=re and parameter =e, satisfying

therefore, in a calculation for k=1 of the action, with background matching, the question arises concerning which
is the correct background to subtract: on the one hand, the locally ads solution which has the higher symmetry
might be physically appealing. however, since its period  is xed, matching it to a solution with a dierent value of
 would introduce a conical singularity at the horizon [11]. on the other hand, the extremal solution, with a lower
value of  (and as we will see, of the energy), has arbitrary  and therefore can be matched to any other solution.
hence, the extremal solution was the preferred background for the matching calculations in refs. [1113].

it is clear from this discussion that the method of counterterm subtraction can be of help here. for the solutions

described above we obtain:

k. not surprisingly, the result is therefore the same

curiously, the results for n=3 and n=4 show dierent qualitative features. for n=3 the result that we obtain
is the same as one would obtain by performing a background subtraction from the locally ads4 solution neglecting
the conical singularity that would appear for k=1. this is rather similar to what we will nd for tnads in the
next section: the method of counterterm subtraction appears to reproduce the results of an imperfect matching
calculation. as a result, the extremal solution (26) has negative energy, whereas the locally ads solution, with =0,
has vanishing action and energy.

by contrast, the result for the hyperbolic n=4 black holes supports the opposite scenario! the action (29) in this
case reproduces precisely that obtained by taking the extremal state (27) as the reference state, and not the locally
ads state (notice that i=0 for the values in eqn. (27)). for n=4 and k=1, the energy (30) of the extremal state
vanishes, a conrmation that this is to be taken as the ground state of the theory. the term e0
k is independent of the
black hole parameters (e.g. the temperature), and its contribution to the action is therefore simply of the form e0
k.
for k=1 this term has been identied in ref. [18] as precisely the casimir energy associated to n =4 superyang
mills theory on the static einstein spacetime irs3, which is the spacetime obtained as the boundary of ads in
this case. this agreement is a striking outcome of the counterterm subtraction method. notice that the interpretation
as a casimir energy is the only possible one, given that the ads solution is the one with the lowest action and energy
among that familyi.e., it is the ground state.

we would like to see whether a similar correspondence holds for k=1. in this case it is crucial to notice that the
ground state is not the locally ads solution. the latter should be regarded as an excited state of the system. the
ground state is the extremal solution, which has zero energy. by translating this into the ads/cft correspondence
we would not expect to nd a casimir energy for the eld theory calculations on the open static universe irh 3.
indeed, the eective action and renormalized stressenergy tensor for conformal elds vanish on that space (see, e.g.,
ref. [26]). this is in perfect agreement with the zero energy results that we nd for the ground state (27) of the theory.
there are, however, some aspects that are in need of further exploration. in particular, from the entropy formula
we see that for k=1, not only the does locally ads solution have nonzero entropy, but so does the extremal ground
state. in particular, for n=4,

sext =

k=1,3l3

27/2g

.

9

(34)

in this respect, this ground state bears resemblance to the extremal black hole ground state state discussed in [29],
which had nonvanishing entropy as well. it is of great interest to understand this result (34) from a eldtheoretical
point of view. the precursor states of ref. [30] constructed in standard eld theory might be extremely relevant
to such a discussion. as proposed in ref. [30], these are degrees of freedom that do not contribute to the energy
density, although they store information. this looks precisely like what is needed to account for an entropy like we
have found in (34). perhaps the entropy of this ground state and the one presented in ref. [29] represents the count
of the number of precursor degrees of freedom in the eld theory.

for black holes in ads6 (i.e., n=5, and in fact, all odd values of n) the conclusions are essentially the same as in
ads4. however, the situation for ads7 is somewhat enigmatic. in this case, the action does not vanish either for the
extremal black hole or for the locally ads solution! also, the energy is nonzero for both. perhaps this is consistent
with yet to be understood properties of the (2, 0) superconformal eld theory that resides on the worldvolume of the
m5brane [33].

finally, it is of interest to note that because the small schwarzschild black holes (in the sense of ref. [7]) survive
the l limit, (i.e., the cosmological constant goes to zero), the surface counterterm subtraction method supplies
results for the action, energy and entropy for ordinary schwarzschild black holes. for odd n, these results coincide
precisely with those obtained by the background subtraction method, using minkowski spacetime as a reference. for
even n, the results would again coincide with the standard results in asymptotically at space, except for the constant
contribution of the casimir energy (32) (and the analogous term in the action). in this case because for n  4 this
energy is proportional to ln2, it becomes an innite constant in the limit l. we will see that this ability to take
the at space limit occurs for other interesting solutions in the next section, and allows us to address and resolve
certain situations which were fraught with uncertainties and/or ambiguiuties in the literature.

v. the antide sitter nutcracker

as we mentioned in the introduction, the issue of choosing a correct reference state for background subtraction has
been a matter of some controversy for taubnut and taubbolt solutions, in the asymptotically locally at situation
[24,25] as well as in the asymptotically locally ads case [14,15].

note that in this section n will be used to denote the nut charge, not the number of dimensionswe will only

deal with fourdimensional solutions.

a. spherical nuts and bolts

the taubnutantidesitter (tnads) solution is

ds2 = v (r)(d + 2n cos d)2 +

dr2
v (r)

+ (r2  n2)(d2 + sin2 d2) ,

where

v =

(r2 + n2)  2mr + l2(r4  6n2r2  3n4)

r2  n2

.

(35)

(36)

here we will simply sketch some of the features of the solution. for a detailed analysis we refer the reader to ref. [14].
if n=0 we recover the schwarzschildads solutions with m as a mass parameter. the analytically continued time,  ,
parameterizes a circle, s1, which is bred over the two sphere s2, with coordinates  and . the nontrivial bration
is a result of a nonvanishing nut charge n. as a result, the boundary as r is described as a squashed
threesphere, where 4n2/l2 parameterizes the squashing.

euclidean regularity of the solution restricts the period of  to be

=8n .

(37)

in addition, the mass parameter has to be restricted so that the xed point set of the killing vector  at radial
position r=r+ is a regular one. hence one nds nut or bolt solutions, depending on whether the xed point set
is zero or two dimensional, respectively. in particular, for nut solutions

10

r+ = n,

mn = n 

4n3
l2

.

(38)

in what follows, by tn-ads we will mean the taubnutads solutions with this particular value of m. notice
that mn vanishes for the value n=l/2. it was shown in ref. [14] that for this particular value the solution is precisely
ads4, with the slicing in which the sections at constant r are round threespheres. in contrast, the solution with
n=m=0 corresponds to ads4 with slices of geometry s1s2. for taubboltads (tbads) the expressions are
more complicated [14]:

mb =

b + n2

(39)

(40)

for rb to be real the discriminant must be nonnegative. furthermore we must take the part of the solution which
corresponds to rb>n. this gives:

n   1

6 

2

12! 1
3

l .

(41)

it is only for this range of parameters that one can construct real euclidean tbads solutions. notice, in particular,
that the ads value l=2n lies outside this range.

in refs. [14,15], the action of the tbads solutions was computed by matching the solutions to a tnads solution
with the same value of the nut charge. the thermodynamics of tbads solutions were then found to be rather similar
to that of schwarzschildads black holes. however, this method precluded an analysis of the tnads solutions by
themselves, since they acted as reference states. a completely rigourous calculation of the action of tnads could
not be performed using the reference background method, simply because it is not possible to match pure ads
(the intuitively obvious candidate background) to tnads, as they have incompatible slices for all n except n=l/2.
equipped with the counterterm subtraction procedure, we can now compute the action for tnads, without any
reference to a background.

we nd, for a solution with generic values of m and n

i =

gl2 (cid:0)l2m + 3n2r+  r3
+(cid:1) ,

where, as we said above, r+ is the minimum possible value of r, where there is a xed point of the killing vector  .
there are several things to note about this result. the rst is a consistency check: if we subtract the values we
obtain for the tbads and tnads solutions, ibolt  inut, we recover (after some algebra), the result obtained in
refs. [14,15] for the action of tbads with tnads as a reference. of course this consistency is to be expected in
general. the standard background subtraction requires the asymptotic geometry of the solution and its reference
state match. hence the counterterms which depend only on the intrinsic boundary geometry must be equal, and will
cancel if one takes the dierence of the counterterm subtracted actions.

next, in the at space limit l we obtain

(44)

(45)

these are precisely the results that were obtained in ref. [24] by an imperfect match of the taubnut solution to
euclidean minkowski space. indeed, the same imperfect match to ads can be seen to reproduce the result (43)
above. even if it is not possible to match the squashed s3 at the boundary to the boundary of ads4 with the slicing
s1s2, a nite result can nevertheless be obtained by neglecting the nontrivial bering and performing a standard
background subtraction. proceeding this way the bulk (volume) term yields, at large r

ibulk =

4n

gl2 (cid:0)l2m + 3n2r+  r3
+(cid:1) +

n3r
gl2 + o(1/r) .

(46)

in contrast to other action calculations in ads, the bulk term, even after subtraction, is not nite by itself, rather
one needs to take into account the gibbonshawking boundary term:

isurf = 

1

8gzm

d3xh(k  k0) = 

n3r
gl2 + o(1/r) .

(47)

by adding (46) and (47) and taking r   we therefore recover eqn. (43).

we therefore conclude that the fact that the match to the background is an imperfect one does not appear to be as
bad as it looks at rst sight. certainly, the result (44) of ref. [24] in the alf limit is on a better standing after having
recovered it from a counterterm calculation.

now we return to the result (43), and specialize to nut solutions using eqn.(38):

itnads =

4n2

g (cid:18)1 

2n2

l2 (cid:19) .

(48)

for n=l/2 we recover the value for ads4 with boundary s3, which will be obtained and discussed in section vi,
whereas for n=0 we recover the value (zero) for ads4 with boundary s1s2. again, these special cases may be
regarded as consistency checks on the internal consistency of our implementation of the procedure.
notice that the action becomes negative for n>n0=l/2. more interestingly, being able to vary the value of the

euclidean period =8n we can compute the energy of the solutions,

e = i =

mn
g

,

(49)

which conrms the interpretation of m as a mass parameter. we may go further and compute the entropy and specic
heat:

s = i  i =

c = s =

6n2

4n2

g (cid:18)1 
g (cid:18)1 + 12

l2 (cid:19) ,
l2(cid:19) .

8n2

n2

(50)

(51)

as had been already noticed in ref. [14], the mass (energy) becomes negative for n>l/2. more strikingly, the entropy
becomes negative for n>l/6! in particular, the entropy of ads4 (n=l/2) is negative (equal to minus its action,
since it has e=0). whereas a negative mass may not be too troublesome (one may shift the energy scale), a negative
entropy certainly would appear to be a sign of pathological behavior.

in ref. [31] it was pointed out that in spaces where euclidean time is nontrivially bered there appeared a contri-
bution to the entropy other than the usual one coming from the bolts (the latter yields the black hole area law). this
extra entropy can be associated to misner strings [32] (a geometric analog of dirac strings), and we would expect it
to contribute to the entropy of tnads. indeed, in the absence of a bolt this appears to be the only possible source
of gravitational entropy for the tnads solution. however, the area of the misner strings in tnads is innite, so
it seems dicult to relate it to the expression we obtained in eqn. (50).
the fact that the specic heat becomes negative for n<l/12 is an indication that the solutions become thermally
unstable, making them unusable for equilibrium thermodynamics7 (in the canonical ensemble). so if we declare that

7nevertheless, a negative specic heat is not so bad as a negative entropy; as a matter of fact, as is well known, the schwarzschild
black hole in asymptotically at space has negative specic heatand so does the alf taubnut solution.

12

the physically relevant solutions are those with both positive entropy and positive specic heat, then the valid range
for the nut charge is

l
12  n 

l
6

.

(52)

solutions in this range have positive action and positive energy.

finally, we note that the results for the energy, entropy and specic heat of tbads can be recovered by combining

those for tnads above, and those for tbads with the tnads subtraction in ref. [14].

b. remarks upon field theory on squashed threespheres

as discussed in ref. [14,15], the study of solutions with nut charge which are locally asymptotically ads is relevant
to the 2+1 dimensional exotic [34] conformal eld theories which live on the world volume of m2branes (and
closely related theorie)8), after placing them on squashed threespheres. following that work, in ref. [35] the eective
actions of various elds on squashed threespheres have been computed.

we do not expect to see in those particular eld theory results any signal of the apparently pathological behaviour
(e.g., negative entropy) which we have found, and indeed we do not. the diculty essentially lies in the fact that the
eld theory results can only be used at weak coupling, whereas supergravity is describing a strongly coupled regime
of the eld theory. the unusual behaviour belongs only to the low temperature phase of the eld theory, and strong
coupling eects change the picture drastically. recall the phase structure described in ref. [14]:

 at high t (small n) we have both tnads and tbads as possible solutions, but the latter has the lower free
energy, and is therefore preferred. it was shown in ref. [14] that at high t , tbads gives the expected behaviour
f  t 3 which, not surprisingly, is the result found in ref. [35]. this is a deconned phase.
 at low t (large n), however, the only existing phase is tnads. there is a phase transition separating this regime
from the deconned phase mentioned above. this phase transition prevents us from obtaining information from the
results in ref. [35], since at weak coupling, where those results were obtained, one does not get the conned phases.
it is in this large n region that the entropy becomes negative. in fact, all of the negative entropy regime is within the
region where the only regular solution is tnads: tbads is absent there.

so we discover that the supergravity studies give us new information on the strongly coupled phases of the theory

on the worldvolume of the m2brane, and related theories, after compactication on squashed threespheres.

c. flat and hyperbolic taubnutads

a solution where the nuts and bolts are at planes instead of spheres can be found as well, and was analyzed in

ref. [14],

where now,

ds2 = v (r)(cid:16)d +

n

l2 (xdy  ydx)(cid:17)2

+

dr2
v (r)

+

r2  n2

l2

(dx2 + dy2) ,

v = 2mr + l2(r4  6n2r2  3n4)

r2  n2

.

(53)

(54)

the bration is in this case a trivial one, and as a result the euclidean period  is independent of n. zero dimensional
xed point sets of  (nuts) exist for mn=  4n3
l2 . solutions with bolts have a higher value of m. the result for the
counterterm calculation of the action for a solution with generic m and n is

8recall there is a problem with the spin structure of tbads, and so the mtheory interpretation is unclear [14], although
there is almost certainly a dual cft nonetheless.

13

i =

l2

8gl2(cid:0)ml2  r3

+ + 3n2r+(cid:1) ,

where, as usual, r+ is the radial position of the xed point set (r+=n for a nut), and l2 accounts for the area of the
(x, y) plane, l/2{x, y}l/2. it can be easily checked that the action of ref. [14], where the nut solution was taken
as a reference background, can be recovered from (55) as i(bolt) i(nut). moreover, (55) is the same result we would
obtain had we performed a background subtraction calculation with imperfect matching to ads4 (the latter in its
at incarnation as n=m=0 in eqn.(53)). we note that for the nut values the action is negative, which reects the
fact that its energy is negativeits entropy vanishes, as could have been expected in the absence of bolts or misner
strings, so in fact we nd inut=enut.

the last possibility is that of having hyperbolic xed point sets of  . the explicit solution is

ds2 = v (r)(d + 2n(cosh   1)d)2 +

dr2
v (r)

+ (r2  n2)(d2 + sinh2 d2) ,

with

v = (r2 + n2)  2mr + l2(r4  6n2r2  3n4)

r2  n2

.

(56)

(57)

the bration is trivial, and, again, there are no misner strings. however, it was found in ref. [14] that there are no
hyperbolic nuts.: it is not possible to make r=n into a regular xed point of  . nevertheless, bolt solutions can be
constructed. this is rather analogous to the situation we encounter for hyperbolic black holes in sec.iv. the result
for the action is again formally very similar to (43) and (55),

(55)

(58)

i =



+(cid:1) ,
8gl2(cid:0)l2m + 3n2r+  r3

where  is the area of the hyperbolic space (if quotients of h 2 are taken to yield surfaces of genus g>1 (this is not
essential) then =4(g1)).

vi. ads revisited

many of the quantities we have been computing can be translated into eld theory results by using the dictionary

provided by the ads/cft correspondence [2,36], namely,

c =

3l
2g

for ads3 , n 3/2 

l2
g

for ads4 , n 2 =

l3
2g

for ads5, n 3 

l5
g

for ads7 ,

(59)

where c is the central charge of the dual cft in two dimensions. the powers of n displayed above are measures
of the number of unconned degrees of freedom: for ads5, n is the rank of the gauge group of the dual n =4
supersymmetric four dimensional su (n ) yangmills theory. meanwhile, for ads4 and ads7, the dual eld theories
are the ones [33,34] that describe the worldvolume dynamics of n parallel m2branes, and m5branes, respectively.
the details of these latter two theories are still rather indirectly and poorly understood, and the precise numerical
relationship between factors (missing in eqn.(59) for these cases) will not be needed here, as we will make no precise
numerical comparison. while there is almost certainly a dual conformal eld theory for the case of ads6, we will not
comment upon it further. note again that ads for all of the dimensions listed arecases that can be handled with the
counterterms that we now have.

in section iii, we considered the counterterm action for ads with the boundary geometries s1m n1

. in those
cases, the action is nite and interestingly for even n, an extra contribution appears of the form e0
k is a
constant energy  see eqn. (32) in section iv. this constant energy is readily interpreted in the dual eld theory as
a casimir energy of the conformal eld theory on s1m n1
k  see ref. [39] for another discussion of casimir energies
in the ads/cft correspondence. we can consider these results for n=2, 4 in more detail: the well known casimir
energy of (1+1) dimensional cft when going from the innite plane to the cylinder irs1 is reproduced by the term
n=2 in eqn. (32). similarly, the casimir energy of four dimensional yangmills theory on irs3 is precisely the value
of e0

k where e0

k

k=+1 for n=4 [18].

14

we found there as well that for the theory on irh 3, even if e0

k=16=0, the result is consistent with the absence
of a casimir energy after identifying correctly the ground state of the theory. we remarked as well upon the striking
appearance of a nonzero entropy for this ground state, which strongly suggests the presence of degrees of freedom
which can contribute to the entropy but not to the energy density, just like the precursor states identied in ref. [30].
(this also reminds us of the nonzero entropy extremal ground state studied in ref. [29].)

we can translate some of our results for the cases of ads4 and ads7 as well, nding that the casimir energies
derived by using eqn.(59) are correctly proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in the theory, as can be
deduced from the power of n which appears in each case: the scaling with n is precisely the same as had been
obtained from computations of black brane entropies [37].

let us now consider adsn+1 with boundary geometries sn and h n as described by the metrics in eqn. (7). in order
to notationally distinguish them from the family s1mk, we will denote them with a 
k. the results for the action
are somewhat more complicated to express for generic n in an explicit form. for the three contributions (the bulk
term, the gibbonshawking surface term, and the counterterm action) we nd

where we have omitted contributions which vanish in the limit r. here the most striking result is that for
even n, (63) there remain logarithmically divergent contributions from the bulk terms that are not cancelled by the
boundary counterterms. furthermore given their logarithmic nature, there is no way that they can be cancelled by a
counterterm which is a local integral over the boundary of a curvature invariant. the appearance of these divergences
then presents a limitation for the utility of the counterterm subtraction technique for investigations of asymptotically
ads solutions in odd dimensions.

however, these divergences do not signal a problem for the ads/cft correspondence, but rather provide a remark-
able consistency check. the possible existence of logarithmic divergences for odd spacetime dimensions was noted
in refs. [4,17], where the coecients of the divergent terms were related to the conformal anomaly in the dual eld
theory. it is a standard result of eld theory in curved spacetime [26,40] that the appearance of a conformal anomaly
in a classically conformally invariant theory is due to logarithmic uv divergences (at least at the oneloop level)
appearing in the quantum eld theory. thus we have the uv/ir relation [41] of the ads/cft correspondence at
work here: the appearance of an innite volume singularity in the ads calculation is a reection of the existence of a
uv divergence in the cft.

further, if we make the association of the ads radius with an energy scale, we see that the divergence is logarithmic
as required by the eld theory. for n=4, it is straightforward to verify that in fact the n =4 sym theory has a
conformal anomaly on s4 or h 4, and further a perturbative weak coupling calculation reveals a logarithmic singularity
in the eective action for the background metric at oneloop [40,38]. that is, despite the remarkable niteness
properties of n =4 sym to higher loops in at space [42], in curved spacetimes the n =4 supersymmetry is only

15

enough to protect against potential quadratic and linear divergences.
in general though, there is the possibility
of oneloop logarithmic divergences. one can show though that for the n =4 sym theory, the coecient of these
divergent terms will always vanish on product space geometries [38]. this is consistent with the fact that no logarithmic
singularities were found in the actions (20) for the boundary geometries s1mk.
let us now write some of these results in terms of eld theory parameters. the result for n=4 should be related
to n =4 supersymmetric fourdimensional yangmills theory on static de sitter space (s4) or antide sitter space
(h 4). we nd a pleasingly simple result,

note the fact that the action does not change sign when going from s4 to h 4 (i.e., k=+1  k=1) has its counterpart
in the eld theory in the fact that the divergent term in the eective action is given by curvature squared terms. in
fact, this result generalizes to no sign change for n=4k where the conformal anomaly is proportional to the 2k power
of curvatures, and a change of sign for n=4k+2, where the relevant power is 2k+1 [40].

the nite part for the action would be expected to follow from eldtheoretical calculations as well. the scaling n 2
is just expected from the number of degrees of freedom of the theory, and the absence of any other factors follows
from dimensional arguments. related to this is the fact that the trace anomaly < t c
c > can be computed exactly
within the ads/cft correspondence [17]. having that, the full stress tensor follows in this case since the symmetry
of the geometry will dictate that < tab >= hab < t c
c > /n. therefore, it is not surprising that a calculation of the
stress tensor in the manner described in ref. [18] reproduces this result.

for ads3 we can write the result as

k,3 = k

where g is the genus of the twodimensional boundary surface, i.e., for the hyperbolic case we have taken quotients
by discrete groups in order to nd genus g surfaces (this is not essential). this is the result for the casimir energy of
the (1+1) dimensional conformal eld theory on a surface of genus g.

in the same vein, we would expect that the presence of a logarithmic running factor for ads7 can be interpreted in

terms of the eective eld theory for the m5brane when dened on six dimensional de sitter space.

it is clear that in the present paper we have only scratched the surface of the full subject, and more detailed and
extensive comparisons between the results of euclidean quantum gravity and the dual eld theories are possible. we
hope to report on progress on this in the future.
