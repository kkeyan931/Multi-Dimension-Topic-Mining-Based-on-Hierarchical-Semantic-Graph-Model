we introduce thermal superspace and show how it can be used to reconcile the
supereld formulation of supersymmetry with nite temperature environments.

1 thermal superspace

immersing a physical system in a heat bath results in the elds acquiring dierent
properties according to their statistics. e.g., nite-temperature bosonic elds obey
periodic boundary conditions, while fermionic elds satisfy antiperiodic b.c.s. such
a distinction can be seen also at the level of the greens functions. depending on
the elds statistics, thermal propagators obey either a bosonic kms condition, or a
fermionic one. therefore, thermal eects induce a clear and mandatory distinction
between bosons and fermions. as a consequence, nite temperature environments
are incompatible with t = 0 supersymmetry : the supersymmetry transformation
is indeed unable to take into account the distinct thermal properties that go along
with dierent statistics.

the thermal superspace approach [1] allows to formulate supersymmetry at nite
temperature in a way which respects the dierent thermal behaviours of bosons
and fermions. the parameters of supersymmetry transformations at t > 0 being
time-dependent and antiperiodic [2] on the imaginary time interval [0, ], thermal
supersymmetry takes periodic bosons into antiperiodic fermions, and vice-versa.
assuming the corresponding t > 0 supersymmetry charges to induce motion in some
superspace, we naturally require the grassmann coordinates of that superspace to
be time-dependent and antiperiodic, like the thermal supersymmetry parameters.
a point in thermal superspace has therefore coordinates [x, b(t),
(t)], t = x0,
where a hat is used to denote thermal quantities, and the thermal grassmann
coordinates are subject to the temperature-dependent antiperiodicity conditions

so, thermal superspace  in which we shall dene thermal superelds, thermal su-
percharges, etc. (see below)  reconciles supersymmetry with nite temperature.
this approach is particularly welcome for, e.g., cosmology, as one can now contem-
plate formulating supergraph techniques at nite temperature, and deriving from
these the t > 0 eective potential in supereld form [3].

thermal supersymmetry corresponds to a transformation with time-dependent,
that is, local parameters. it is in this sense a form of supergravity, but a restricted
one, as locality is enforced only in the time direction, and as, moreover, the thermal
supersymmetry parameters are subject to an antiperiodicity condition identical to
equation (1).

2 thermal superelds, super-kms condition & super-b.c.

at t = 0, supermultiplets are conveniently described in the language of super-
elds. here we dene thermal superelds as expansions in thermal superspace, and
show how these can be used to write consistent boundary and kms [4] conditions.
in taking t-dependent superspace grassmanns, we introduce a new t-dependence
in the chiral variables, which we dene at t > 0 through by
(t).
thermal chiral superelds can then be expanded as

(t) = x  i b(t)b

b[ by(t), b(t)] = z[ by(t)] + 2 b(t) [ by(t)]  b(t) b(t) f [ by(t)] ,

(2)

and thermal antichiral ones follow a similar expansion. the thermal (chiral-antichi-
ral) supereld propagator3 gc [ by1, by2, b1,
2]i expands, in
analogy to t = 0, as

2 fc[ by1  by2] ,

where dc, sc and fc denote the thermal propagators for the component elds z, 
and f , respectively. thermal eld theory requires the propagators of thermal scalar
components to obey a bosonic kms condition,

c (t1; x1, t2; x2) = d<
d>
f >
c (t1; x1, t2; x2) = f <

c (t1 + i; x1, t2; x2) ,
c (t1 + i; x1, t2; x2) ,

while the thermal fermionic component must fulll a fermionic kms constraint,

c  (t1; x1, t2; x2) = s< 
s> 

c  (t1 + i; x1, t2; x2) .

thermal superspace allows to write a kms condition at the level of thermal super-

2(t2)] ,

(6)

where by1(t1+i) = by1(t1) + (i ; 0). clearly, the supereld kms condition (6) is
of bosonic type, since chiral and antichiral superelds are bosonic objects. this
condition can be proven directly [1] at the thermal supereld level. also, one easily
veries [1] that the super-kms condition yields the component kms conditions
(3), (4) and (5). the antiperiodicity (1), which captures the essence of thermal
superspace, is an essential ingredient of these proofs.

our thermal supereld expansion (2) can easily be seen to be consistent also
from the point of view of the elds boundary conditions. thermal chiral superelds
being bosonic objects, they obey in thermal superspace a periodic supereld boundary
condition, b[ by(t), b(t)] = b[ by(t+i), b(t + i)], which writes, when cast in the variables
(x, b,

b
), x = (t; x),

b[t; x, b(t),

we get from (7) : (i) for the thermal scalar eld z the periodic b.c. z(t; x) =
z(t + i; x), (ii) for the thermal fermion , upon replacing b(t + i) =  b(t), the
antiperiodic b.c. (t; x) = (t + i; x), and (iii) for the thermal scalar eld f , due
to b(t + i) b(t + i) = b(t) b(t), the periodic b.c. f (t; x) = f (t + i; x).

3 thermal covariant derivatives

deriving supersymmetry covariant derivatives and supercharges on thermal su-
perspace can be done simply by evaluating the eect of changing variables from t = 0
b
superspace [x, , ] to thermal superspace [x, , 
(t)]. the partial
derivatives with respect to x,  and  transform trivially, while t  (tt) t +

however, the fact that the algebra is preserved at nite temperature does not mean
that supersymmetry is thermally unbroken. this can be understood as follows. both
the thermal elds b.c.s and the kms conditions carry information that is of global
character, in the sense that it relates the values of the eld at distant regions in
space-time, along the time direction. as a consequence, the thermal superalgebra,
which is a local structure, is insensitive to such global conditions and preserves its
structure at nite temperature. in particular, the antiperiodicity conditions on the
thermal grassmann coordinates, eq. (1), have no inuence on the algebra. it is only
the local statement that the superspace grassmann variables should be allowed to
depend on time which makes it necessary to covariantize the algebra generators.

to analyze thermal supersymmetry breaking, we must invetigate systems of ther-
mal elds. as thermal bosons and fermions are distinguished by their global bound-
ary and kms conditions, we shall see thermal supersymmetry breaking in doing so.

4the thermal translation and lorentz generators are dened similarly [1].
5the thermal time translation operator bp 0 = i b 0 can be interpreted as a central charge of

the subalgebra one obtains upon removing the thermal lorentz boosts [1].

e.g., expanding `a la matsubara the d = 4, t = 0 wess-zumino action, we get a d = 3
euclidean action for the thermal modes in which the mass degeneracy is seen to be
broken [1].

5 field realizations

thermal supersymmetry breaking should also be seen at the level of the realiza-
tions of the thermal supersymmetry algebra. the next question we ask, therefore,
is how thermal supersymmetry transforms the components of thermal superelds.
this means translating into component language the thermal supersymmetry trans-
formation b b = i(b bq + b 
) b. we may either derive straightforwardly the com-
ponent transformations [1] and note the perfect analogy to the t = 0 case, or invoke
the argument [2] that the thermal supersymmetry parameters should become time-
dependent and antiperiodic at nite temperature. in both cases, we get


b
q

bz = 2b ,
b = 2bf  i2(b)(z) ,

bf = i2(b)() ,

(10)

where the unique dierence with the case of zero temperature is the appearance of the
thermal (time-dependent and antiperiodic) spinorial parameter b, b, with b(t + i) =
b(t), b(t + i) = b(t), in place of the constant spinorial parameter ,  of t = 0
(10) can be translated into transformations of the d = 3
supersymmetry. eqs.
matsubara modes [1], upon developing thermally the t-dependent parameters b, b.
neither the (t = 0) wess-zumino kinetic action nor the mass action are invariant
under the thermal supersymmetry transformations. at the level of the d = 3 thermal
modes, the variation of the total action is seen to be proportional to the fermionic
matsubara frequency f
n  t . in the t  0 limit, one expects supersymmetry to
be restored. the variations of the mass and kinetic actions indeed vanish separately
in that limit.
