we introduce the spherical eld formalism for free gauge elds. we discuss
the structure of the spherical hamiltonian for both general covariant gauge
and radial gauge and point out several new features not present in the scalar
eld case. we then use the evolution equations to compute gauge-eld and
eld-strength correlators. [pacs numbers: 11.10.kk, 11.15.tk, 11.15.-q]

1 overview

spherical eld theory is a new non-perturbative method for studying quan-
tum eld theory. it was introduced in [1] to describe scalar boson interac-
tions. the method utilizes the spherical partial wave expansion to reduce
a general d-dimensional euclidean functional integral into a set of coupled
one-dimensional, radial systems. the coupled one-dimensional systems are
then converted to dierential equations which then can be solved using stan-
dard numerical methods.4 the extension of the spherical eld method to
fermionic systems was described in [2]. in that analysis it was shown that
the formalism avoids several diculties which appear in the lattice treat-
ment of fermions. these include fermion doubling, missing axial anomalies,
and computational diculties arising from internal fermion loops. this nd-
ing suggests that the spherical formalism could provide a useful method for
studying gauge theories, especially those involving fermions. as a small but
important initial step in this direction, we contribute the present work in
which we introduce and discuss the spherical eld method for free gauge

elds.

the basic formalism for spherical boson elds was described in [1]. in this
paper we will build on those results with most of our attention devoted to
new features resulting from the intrinsic spin of the gauge eld. we discuss
the operator structure of the spherical hamiltonian in detail, using two-
dimensional euclidean gauge elds as an explicit example. like standard
eld theory gauge-xing is essential in spherical eld theory, and we have
chosen to consider general covariant gauge and radial gauge5. in each case
we derive the spherical hamiltonian and use the corresponding evolution
equations to calculate the two-point correlators for the gauge eld and the
gauge-invariant eld strength. free gauge elds in higher dimensions can
be described by a straightforward generalization of the methods presented
here. the application of spherical eld theory to non-perturbative interacting
gauge systems and related issues are the subject of current research.

2 covariant gauge

in this section we derive the spherical eld hamiltonian for general covariant
gauge. we will use both polar and cartesian coordinates with the following
conventions:

~t = (t cos , t sin ) = (t1, t2) = (x, y).

in general covariant gauge the euclidean functional integral is given by

z (cid:0)qidai(cid:1) exp(cid:20)z 

0

dt l(cid:21)

where

l =z d t(cid:2) 1

2 f 12f 12  1

2(iai)2(cid:3) .

we can write the eld strength f 12 as

f 12 = 1

in [1] the spherical hamiltonian for the scalar eld was found by direct appli-
cation of the feynman-kac formula. this is also possible here, but in view of
the number of mixed terms (a result of the intrinsic spin degrees of freedom)
we nd it easier to use the method of canonical quantization. let us dene
the conjugate momenta to the gauge elds,

we now see that h0 is equivalent to two harmonic oscillators with level-

. it is important to note that h1, however, is
quite dierent. the s-wave congurations are independent of , and so h1
does not have terms of the form z+1
. furthermore the gauge
elds are massless and so h1 depends only on the derivatives of z+1
and

0 . one consequence of this is that the spectrum of h1 is continuous, and
calculations involving h1 and relevant boundary conditions must be done
carefully. we will discuss these issues later in our analysis of correlation
functions.

that |ai is constant with respect to the s-wave variables z1
and has

non-zero overlap with the ground state of h as t  0+, and |bi has non-zero
overlap with the ground state of h as t  .7 because the spectrum of
h1 is continuous, in numerical computations it is useful to include a small
regulating mass, , for the gauge elds and then take the limit   0.

3 radial gauge

we now derive the spherical eld hamiltonian for radial gauge. we take the
gauge-xing reference point, ~t0, to be the origin,
(~t  ~t0)  ~a = ~t  ~a = 0.

(40)

we expect this gauge-xing scheme to be convenient in spherical eld theory
calculations for several reasons. one is that non-abelian ghost elds in radial
gauge decouple, as they do in axial gauge.
in contrast with axial gauge,
however, radial gauge also preserves rotational symmetry. as we will see, the
spherical hamiltonian and correlation functions in radial gauge are relatively
simple. since

we can impose the gauge-xing condition by setting

~t  ~a = t2(cid:2)eia+1 + eia1(cid:3) ,

with this constraint we express the eld strength as

a1 = e2ia+1.

f 12 = 1

i xn=0,1,

einh a+1

the radial-gauge lagrangian is then

7one caveat here is that |ai must lie in a function space over which the spectrum of h

is bounded below.

we note the radial gauge constraint has removed the continuous spectrum

tmin

dt h( ~j )(cid:21)|ai ,

where |ai has non-zero overlap with the ground state of h as t  0+, and
|bi has non-zero overlap with the ground state of h as t  . since the
level-spacing of h1 diverges as t  0+ only the ground state projection of
h1 at t = 0 contributes, and |ai no longer needs to be constant with respect
to the s-wave variables z1
0 . this a rather important point since, as we recall
from [1], the constant s-wave boundary condition at t = 0 follows from the
fact that the value of eld at the origin is not constrained. this is however
not true in radial gauge as a result of the gauge-xing constraint.

8the reason is that in radial gauge the gauge elds are tangentially polarized, and so
purely tangential excitations in two dimensions do not contribute to the eld strength f 12.

4 gauge-eld correlators

in this section we calculate two-point gauge-eld correlators using the spher-
ical eld formalism. this calculation can be done in several ways, including
numerically. for future applications, however,
it is useful to have exact
expressions for use in perturbative calculations (e.g., for evaluating countert-
erms). here we will obtain results by decomposing the elds as a combination
of the ladder operators. let us start with radial gauge. we have

the length scale l is used to render the argument of the logarithm dimension-
less. its purpose, however, is only cosmetic since the gauge-eld correlator is
not infrared divergent in radial gauge and the dependence on l cancels.9

these same methods can be applied to gauge-eld correlators in covariant

gauge. we nd

5 gauge-invariant correlators

let us now consider the two-point correlator of the gauge-invariant eld
strength f 12. we can calculate the f 12 correlator by dierentiating the
gauge-eld correlators calculated in the previous section, but it is instructive
to redo the calculation by coupling a source to f 12. this time we describe
the calculation in detail for covariant gauge. the same calculation can be
done for radial gauge using similar methods. let us start by quoting the
result we expect. from free eld theory we know

h0| f 12(~t)f 12(~t) |0i = 2(~t  ~t).

(77)

the f 12 correlator has a simple local structure, a consequence of the fact
that in two dimensions gauge elds can be decomposed into scalar and lon-
gitudinal polarizations (borrowing minkowski space terminology). there are
no transverse polarizations to produce non-local contributions to the f 12
correlator. we will see this happen explicitly in the calculations to follow.

the two-point correlator for partial waves of f 12 is given by

h0| f 12

n (t)f 12

n (t) |0i = 1

2z ddeinein

h0| f 12(~t)f 12(~t) |0i ,

(78)

and we deduce

h0| f 12

n (t)f 12

n (t) |0i = 1

t n,n(t  t).

(79)

let us now reproduce this result using the spherical eld method. we return

suces to compute the correlator restricted to the subspace which is constant

6 summary

in this work we applied the methods of spherical eld theory to free gauge
elds. we analyzed two dimensional gauge elds in general covariant gauge

10as noted before, this is due to the fact that in two dimensions there are no transverse

polarizations.

14

and radial gauge. in the process we have discussed several new aspects which
resulted from the spin degrees of freedom as well as the masslessness of the
gauge eld. as we have seen, polarization mixing complicates the structure
of the spherical eld hamiltonian. nevertheless in radial gauge we were able
to decompose the spherical eld hamiltonian as a sum of harmonic oscilla-
tors. we did the same for covariant gauge, but found that the s-wave part of
the hamiltonian has continuous spectrum. in relation to these dierences,
we also discussed issues regarding the s-wave boundary condition at t = 0.
we then used the spherical eld evolution equations to calculate two-point
correlators for the gauge elds and eld-strength tensors f 12. our presen-
tation here is intended as a rst introduction to the application of spherical
eld methods to gauge theories. free gauge elds in higher dimensions can
be treated by a straightforward generalization of these methods. interacting
gauge systems, however, include many interesting theoretical and computa-
tional issues not discussed here, and these are the subject of active research.
