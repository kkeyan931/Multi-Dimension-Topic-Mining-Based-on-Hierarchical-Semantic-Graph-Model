abstract

we present a formulation of the coupling of vector multiplets to n = 2
supergravity which is symplectic covariant (and thus is not based on a
prepotential) and uses superconformal tensor calculus. we do not start from
an action, but from the combination of the generalised bianchi identities
of the vector multiplets in superspace, a symplectic denition of special
kahler geometry, and the supersymmetric partners of the corresponding
constraints. these involve the breaking to super-poincare symmetry, and
lead to on-shell vector multiplets.
this symplectic approach gives the framework to formulate vector multiplet
couplings using a weaker dening constraint for special kahler geometry,
which is an extension of older denitions of special kahler manifolds for
some cases with only one vector multiplet.

1 introduction

the understanding of the most general coupling of vector multiplets in n = 2 super-
symmetry or supergravity is important in very dierent contexts.
it is used in the
context of the low energy eective actions of supersymmetric gauge theories and their
coupling to hypermultiplets [1]. it is also an essential element in the compactication
of string theory on calabi-yau manifolds [2]. this general coupling has been studied
for the supergravity case in [3, 4] and has been given the name special geometry [5].
the similar coupling in rigid supersymmetry was obtained in [6] and is referred to as
rigid special geometry.

historically, the coupling of several n = 2 matter multiplets to n = 2 supergravity
in 4 dimensions was found using superconformal tensor calculus [7, 8, 3, 4, 9]. su-
perconformal actions are build with representations of a larger algebra, the n = 2
superconformal one. the residual symmetries are broken by introducing two compen-
sating multiplets (one vector multiplet to give rise to the graviphoton in the poincare
gravity multiplet and a hyper-, a linear or a non-linear multiplet) to end up with an
n = 2 poincare supergravity theory coupled to n = 2 matter multiplets. reviews on
superconformal tensor calculus can be found in [10]. the superconformal construction
claries the origin of lots of terms in the action. here we will conne ourselves to the
coupling of vector multiplets to supergravity, where after breaking the superconformal
symmetry, the complex scalars of the vector multiplets form a special kahler manifold.
a prepotential, a holomorphic function of second order, was an essential ingredient
to construct the theory. in [11, 12, 13], other approaches were used to describe the
coupling of vector multiplets to supergravity.

electric-magnetic duality transformations in 4 dimensions manifest themselves by
symplectic transformations [14]. symplectic transformations in a special kahler man-
ifold have been studied in [4, 15]. the duality symmetry is not a symmetry of the
complete action, but only of the equations of motion.
in particular, the prepoten-
tial is not an invariant of the symplectic transformations. on the other hand, for a
coordinate-free formulation of special geometry [11], the symplectic symmetry is an
essential ingredient. the symplectic setup also claried the link to calabiyau mani-
folds [2]. in [16], vector multiplet couplings to supergravity were constructed for which
no prepotential existed, by performing a symplectic transformation of an action based
on a prepotential. the resulting action was thus not based on a prepotential. the
rst and main purpose of this paper is to obtain a symplectic covariant formulation of
the coupling of vector multiplets to n = 2 supergravity which at the same time uses

1

superconformal tensor calculus. in particular, it should thus contain the coupling of
[16]. for obtaining an action in superconformal tensor calculus, one needs a prepoten-
tial, and hence give up the symplectic covariance. the combination of superconformal
and symplectic covariance will however be possible if we only construct equations of
motions without an action.

the various possible actions and geometric formulations were compared in [17],
and one has arrived at a new denition of special geometry (also the denition for
the case of rigid supersymmetry is given there). remarkably, it was also noticed that
one part of the denition, expressed by dierential constraints, can be formulated
in two dierent ways. these two forms are equivalent when more than one vector
multiplet is coupled to supergravity, but inequivalent if only one vector multiplet is
coupled. the presentation in [17] contained the constraints such that for one vector
multiplet the coupling known previously (e.g. from superconformal tensor calculus) is
obtained. but it was noted that another form of the constraints is possible, which is
also symplectic covariant. obvious physical arguments could not exclude the existence
of hitherto unknown couplings of 1 vector multiplet to supergravity which obey the
weaker constraint, and not the stronger one. the second aim of this paper is to show
that such new couplings are indeed possible.

to be more explicit, let us repeat here one of the formulations of the 3 equivalent
denitions of a special kahler manifold of [17]1. the most suitable denition for our
discussion is formulated in terms of symplectic products.
it is the one which was
denoted as denition 3.

denition of a special kahler manifold

take a complex manifold m. suppose we have in every chart a 2(n + 1) component
vector v (z, z) such that on overlap regions there are transition functions of the form

1

2 (f (z) f (z)) s ,

e

(1.1)

(these
with f a holomorphic function and s a constant sp(2(n + 1), ir) matrix.
transition functions have to satisfy the cocycle condition.) take a u(1) connection of
the form  dz +   dz with

  =  ,

(1.2)

1the rst one is not explicitly symplectic covariant, but we could as well have discussed here
denition 2, where the constraint relevant for the discussion below was formulated as hv, vi = 0.
the alternative form is then hv, vi = 0.

under which v has opposite weight as v . denote the covariant derivative by d:

u  dv  v + v ,
u   d  v   v    v ,

d v  v +  v ,
d v   v   v .

we impose the following conditions:

hv, v i = i ,
1.
2. d v = 0 ,
3. d[u] = 0 ,
hv, ui = 0 ,
4.

(1.3)

(1.4)

(1.5)

(1.6)

(1.7)

where h,i denotes the symplectic inner product, e.g. hv, v i = v t  v , with an anti-
symmetric matrix , which has as standard form

st =   0


0! .

(1.8)

dene

(1.9)
where u  denotes the complex conjugate of u. if this is a positive-denite metric, m
is called a special kahler manifold.

g   ihu, u i ,

it can then be shown that locally a function k  exists such that

 = 1

2k  ,

  =  =  1

2  k  .

(1.10)

the real part of k  is the kahler potential k. if there is an imaginary part im k ,
then

v  = eiim k /2v ,

(1.11)

satises the same constraints with k  replaced by the real k.

as discussed at the end of section 4.2.2 in [17], the constraints have a clear physical
interpretation, related to the positivity of kinetic terms in the action. but as suggested
there already, the fourth constraint (1.7) could be replaced by

4. hu, ui = 0 ,

(1.12)

without violating the physical arguments. the constraint 4 implies 4, by taking a
covariant derivative and antisymmetrising, and with 4 it was shown that 4 follows
when n > 1. however, for n = 1, the equation 4 is empty. taking 4 as constraint

3

thus allows hv, uzi 6= 0. such n = 2 models would be new, and this possibility will be
investigated in this paper. it will be called the special case. the case with n > 1 or
hv, ui = 0 will be called the generic case.

in appendix c of [17], two n = 1 examples are given where the condition (1.7) is not
fullled. in these examples it was shown that the relaxation of that constraint leads
to models not allowed by other denitions of special geometry. here we will rst give
further evidence of the non-triviality of this condition. the main result will be that
indeed models which violate (1.7), still allow an n = 2 supersymmetric formulation.

the scalars of the special kahler manifolds are contained in the  = 0 sector of
chiral superelds of n = 2 supersymmetry. a chiral multiplet is a reducible represen-
tation of n = 2 supersymmetry. after imposing suitable constraints, it gives a vector
multiplet. in rigid supersymmetry these constraints can be written in superspace for a
symplectic section of superelds or, in components, as a linear multiplet of constraints
of symplectic sections [17, 18]. with a standard symplectic metric (1.8), the rigid spe-
cial kahler constraints can be used to write the lower part of the symplectic sections
v in terms of the upper one. the reducibility constraints for the lower parts of the
sections then give rise to the eld equations of the elds in the upper parts. we want
to use this approach to construct the eld equations of vector multiplets, coupled to
n = 2 supergravity.

chiral and vector multiplets can also be dened as representations of the local su-
perconformal algebra. then the elds of the gauge multiplet of the superconformal
gauge invariances, which is the weyl multiplet, enter in the transformation rules of
the multiplets [7, 8]. to describe the coupling of n on-shell vector multiplets to super-
gravity, we will start from 2n + 2 chiral multiplets. the linear multiplet of constraints
which reduce these chiral multiplets to vector multiplets in supergravity will contain
additional terms with elds of the weyl multiplet [7].

the equations that follow by supersymmetry from this weak denition of special
kahler geometry are derived for the complete set of 2n + 2 chiral multiplets. the con-
straints dening special kahler geometry involve a breaking of dilatations and the u(1)
transformations in the superconformal group. we choose also a symplectic fermionic
constraint as gauge choice for ssupersymmetry. special conformal symmetry is bro-
ken by a choice for the dilatation gauge eld as in previous approaches. so nally,
this leads to the breaking of superconformal to super-poincare spacetime symmetry
with a residual internal su(2) in a consistent way, without relying on a prepotential
or an action. combining the reducibility constraints with the constraints of special
kahler geometry we nd n on-shell vector multiplets, coupled to 24+24 supergravity

4

components, remnants of the weyl multiplet.

these 24+24 components reside in a current multiplet, which we identify as a
reduced chiral selfdual supereld. the full supergravity equations, however, would
rely on a second compensating multiplet, which is independent of the symplectic for-
mulation. for these aspects we refer to the 3 known constructions of auxiliary eld
formulations [19, 7].

in section 2, the building blocks of the construction, the weyl multiplet and the
chiral multiplet, are given. their supersymmetry transformation rules and the con-
straint to make a vector multiplet out of a chiral are recapitulated. in section 3 the
special kahler constraints and the supersymmetric relatives are treated for the most
general case. in section 4 we combine the constraints imposed on the chiral multiplets
and those found in section 3 to nd on-shell vector multiplets. finally we comment
on the remaining o-shell components of supergravity and their eld equations. we
recapitulate our results in section 5.

2 the building blocks of the construction

in this section we review the weyl multiplet, i.e. the gauge multiplet of the n = 2
superconformal symmetry, and the superconformal chiral multiplet, coupled to the
weyl multiplet. most of the material presented here is well-known (see e.g. [8, 20])2.

the weyl multiplet is the gravitational multiplet of n = 2 superconformal gravity.
it contains the gauge elds ea
. they are, respectively,
gauge elds of general coordinate transformations, lorentz rotations, dilatations, spe-
cial conformal boosts, chiral su(2) and u(1), supersymmetry and special supersym-
metry. the representation is completed by the lorentz tensor t ij
ab, antisymmetric in
[ij], the spinor i and the scalar d. note that t ij
ab is the antiselfdual tensor, and
its complex conjugate tabij is selfdual. the spin connection and the gauge elds for
the special conformal transformations and special supersymmetry are composite gauge
elds, given by

2.2 the chiral multiplet

a chiral multiplet is a reducible representation of the superconformal algebra [8]. by
imposing a linear multiplet of constraints it becomes a vector multiplet. this is an
irreducible representation of the superconformal algebra. the constraints are called the
generalised bianchi identities, because they contain a bianchi identity for the tensor
in the chiral multiplet.

later we want to couple vector multiplets to conformal supergravity. the scalars
of these vector multiplets form a symplectic section. they are the lowest components
of a multiplet. therefore, all the components of the multiplets have to form such a
symplectic section. this is the reason to start from a 2n + 2-dimensional section of
chiral multiplets:

this section of multiplets is independent of the existence of a prepotential. the mul-

as we do not impose the constraints to obtain a vector supereld or the special kahler

the symplectic vector of chiral multiplets with these constraints dene 2n + 2 vector
multiplets in superconformal gravity. the special kahler constraints will relate them
such that one ends up with n + 1 vectors and n complex scalars and spinors obeying
eld equations.

3 gauge choices and special kahler constraints

to obtain a poincare supergravity theory of n vector multiplets, we start from the
assumption that the components in the symplectic sections v are the lowest compo-
nents of reduced chiral multiplets, as it is the case in previous constructions of matter
couplings in n = 2 supergravity. to achieve that, we have to impose the reducibility
constraints (2.11)(2.14) on the chiral multiplets and suitable constraints that impose
restrictions on the sections such that the resulting theory contains n physical vector
multiplets and the gravity multiplet. the superuous symmetries of the superconfor-
mal construction need to be broken by suitable gauge choices. the symplectic section v
can be seen as a function of n scalars z and their complex conjugates z  ( = 1, ..., n).
these scalars can be interpreted as the coordinates of a special kahler manifold.

having introduced k  in (1.10), we have exhausted constraint (1.6). the remaining
relevant constraints are then (1.4), (1.5), and we will take the formulation with (1.12).
condition (1.4) gauge xes the dilatations, choosing the canonical kinetic term for
the graviton. equation (1.5) imposes the holomorphicity of the scalar elds. for the
symmetry of the kinetic matrix of the vectors, one needs another constraint, which is
(1.12). in all previous papers on special geometry, one imposed instead (1.7), which

8

is equivalent for n > 1, but not for n = 1 as mentioned in the introduction. there is
no physical argument known to demand (1.7), but up to now, no physical applications
have been found that do not fulll it.

we have thus seen that we can look upon the equations (1.4)(1.5) in two ways.
they are the dening equations of special geometry, as well, they can be considered
as gauge choices for the dilatations and chiral u(1) transformations present in the
superconformal algebra. as we will see below a supersymmetric extension of these
constraints will include the gauge choice of s-supersymmetry.

from (1.3) follows

g    k = ihu, u i .

(3.1)

furthermore we impose the physical condition (positivity of the kinetic energy terms
of the vectors [17]) that3

det g  > 0
z z  gz z  zz zz > 0
g
using the constraints it can be shown that

hv, ui = 0 ,
if
for zz  hv, uzi .

w = (v, u, v , u )

(3.2)

(3.3)

forms for every z, z a basis for symplectic vectors. more information about the ex-
pansion coecients can be found in appendix a. this expansion will be used in the
derivation of the supersymmetric extension of the special kahler constraints and of the
eld equations.

3.1 the constraint on the curvature

covariant derivatives involve the kahler connection as in (1.3), and after choosing a
real kahler potential one may dene a kahler weight4 p for a symplectic section w ,
such that

dw = (cid:16) + p

2 (k)(cid:17) w ,

d w = (cid:16)  p

2 (k)(cid:17) w .

(3.4)

if w carries indices  or  there is a further metric connection, dened such that
dg = 0. the curvature of the special kahler manifold is then dened by

[d,d ]x = pg x  r 

x ,

(3.5)

3 keep in mind that for n > 1 one has always zz = 0.
4v and u have weight 1, while zz has weight 2, and opposite for their complex conjugates.

where x is a generic vector with kahler weight p. applying this for x replaced by
u and taking the symplectic inner product with u one nds

(3.7)

and expand the last term of (3.6)in the basis w according to appendix a we obtain
the following two cases:
1.the generic case :

and the curvature is constrained to

du = icg u ,

r    g r

  = 2g(| |g) + cg c .

2.the special case :
in a similar way one nds that in this case

dzuz = igz z(czzz uz  gz zdzzz v ) .

the curvature becomes

rz zz z = 2g2

z z  gz z(dzzz)gz z(dz zz) + czzzgz z cz zz .

and uz by dening

z = uz + izz v ;

z = uz  i zzv .

(3.12)

we then have symplectic products

hv, u 

hv, v i = i ,
h u 

zi = hv, u 
zi = h v , u 
zi = i(gz z  zz zz) = ig
z z .
in this way we nd the hermitian metric g
z z which is invertible because of (3.2), but
is not the second derivative of the kahler potential k, used to dene the covariant

derivatives in (3.4). with this denition, covariant derivatives on the above equations
lead to

z, v i = hdzu 

z, v i = 0 .

the dening expressions for uz and zz imply

dz uz = gz z v ,

observe that the rst term has g and not g as this is the kahler curvature. calculating
as before the curvature r by replacing xz with u , and an inner product with u , the
last terms in (3.16) lead to extra terms such that we nd

(3.21)

rephrasing as much as possible in terms of the metric g
z z, we thus recover another
geometry as for other special kahler models. there is an essential dierence in the
product of metrics in (3.6) and here. we tried to extend our analysis in the basis
w  = (v, u 
z), but ran into problems with the transformation rules because we
want v to be the lowest component of a chiral multiplet. so, it is not possible to get
rid of zz 6= 0 by choosing another basis while keeping a section of chiral multiplets.
the model with zz 6= 0 is really another model than the ones studied in the past.

for some calculations below, it is also useful to introduce another basis with sym-

plectic vectors orthogonal to u. that is, we introduce

3.3 supersymmetric extension of special kahler constraints

it is clear that the constraint (1.4) breaks the superconformal symmetry. the con-
straints and their supersymmetric partners therefore play the role of gauge conditions
for some of the superconformal symmetries. the residual symmetry should then still
contain the symmetries of poincare supergravity. in this subsection we will derive the
supersymmetric partners of the constraints (1.4), (1.5) and (1.12) and compute the de-
composition rule for the resulting supergravity, i.e. the rule which gives the remaining
symmetry as linear combination of the original, superconformal, symmetry.

3.3.1 gauge choices and decomposition rule

before we go to these constraints, we break the special conformal symmetry by imposing
a constraint on b:

kgauge:

b = 0 .

(3.23)

this does not alter the number of degrees of freedom as b is pure gauge in the weyl
multiplet (cf. table 1).

the decomposition rule for the special conformal symmetry is

a

k = ea(cid:16) 1

2 ii  3

4 ii  1

2 ii + h.c.(cid:17) .

(3.24)

constraint (1.4) breaks the dilatations. indeed, the superconformal transformation of
(1.4) gives

h v , i ii  hv, i ii + 2id = 0 ,

(3.25)

and the dilatations are now a combination of other symmetries. we choose as sgauge

sgauge:

h v , ii = 0 and hv, ii = 0 .

remark that after this gauge choice the decomposition rule (3.25) simplies to

d = 0 ,

such that we can forget about the original dilatations completely. demanding that the
sections v depend on z and z  in the way described in (1.3)(1.5), is a gauge choice
for the chiral u(1)-transformations. in fact, consider the transformation of the rst
line of (2.10) using these equations:

v = uz  1

2(k z  k z )v .

(3.28)

an inner product with v gives (using (1.4) and its covariant derivative) a decomposition
rule for the u(1)-transformations, i.e.

a = im (k z) ,

(3.29)

where we have already used (1.10).

the decomposition rule for s(i) follows from the variation of the sgauge:

(3.30)

from now on, we only request that the constraints are invariant under the resulting
poincare supersymmetry

(i) = q(i) + s(i) + a(a) + k(k) ,

(3.31)

with k, a and i dened in (3.24), (3.29) and (3.30).

having the symplectic sections as functions of z and z, we can consider the trans-
formations of the bosonic constraints (1.4)(1.6) and (1.12). the variation of the rst
one determined the breaking of dilatations. the constraints (1.5) and (1.6) are used to
determine the z, z dependencies of v , u and k and their supersymmetry transforma-
tions are thus trivial if we compute them in terms of z and z. the constraint (1.12)
is only non-trivial for n > 1. its variation is

hu, ui = 2hdu[, u]iz ,

(3.32)

which is 0 due to the symmetry of (3.7). this nishes the supersymmetry variations
of the bosonic special kahler constraints.

3.3.2 physical fermions and fermionic constraints

the rst line of (2.10), using (3.27) and (3.29), is in terms of z:

therefore, the supersymmetry transformation of z is chiral, and we dene 

i as

ii = uz .

(3.33)

leading to

i = u

compatible with the sgauge. the relation (3.35) can be inverted to

i = ig h u , ii .


(3.34)

(3.36)

that i has only components in the u direction implies the constraints (the primes
here and below are irrelevant for n > 1 or zz = 0)

3.3.3 further variations of constraints in the generic case

at the rst fermionic level we have imposed the gauge choice (3.26), and found further-
more the constraints (3.37), leaving n physical fermions as shown in (3.35) and (3.36).
the variation of the sgauge leads to the decomposition rule. here we will determine
the further constraints on the 2(n + 1) chiral multiplets in the symplectic vector. we
rst perform this analysis for the generic case where hv, ui = 0, and treat the case
n = 1 separately afterwards.

the poincare transformations on (3.37) give

hv, yiji = 0 ,
hu, yiji = c
hv, f 
hu, f 

abi = 0 ,
abi =  1


i 
j ,

2 cij(

(3.40)

to analyse the content of these equations, we make use of lemma b.1 of [17]. this says
that the 2(n + 1)  (n + 1) matrix (v, u) has rank (n + 1). thus we can solve (3.40)
for half of the components of yij and f 
ab.

straightforward variation of these two equations under poincare supersymmetry

yields a set of new constraints:

xed and thus independent of the other transformations. we will not indicate these transformations
explicitly, as they follow from the position of the i indices.

these are all the possible kahler constraints on the sections. let us review the
degrees of freedom. before imposing the constraints, we have the degrees of freedom
as in table 1. first of all there is the weyl multiplet with 24 + 24 degrees of freedom.
the gauge invariances have been used to determine the counting. indeed, the dilation
invariance can be seen as removing the trace of the vierbein e
 is pure gauge
under special supersymmetry. similarly the vectors a and v
i loose a degree of
freedom because of their gauge transformations. secondly, we have the symplectic
vectors of 2n + 2 chiral multiplets, which altogether consist of (2n + 2)16 + (2n + 2)16
degrees of freedom.

 and i

j

then we have imposed the constraints (1.4)(1.6), (1.12) and their supersymmetry
partners. the new counting is in table 2. all the symplectic sections are rst reduced
to (n + 1) rather than (2n + 2) degrees of freedom, as inner products with v and
with u are removed by the constraints. the symplectic vector v is further reduced
to n complex variables z, by constraints which we have interpreted as gauge choices
of dilatations and chiral u(1). these invariances have thus disappeared, and in the
upper part of the table we should thus not subtract them anymore from degrees of
freedom of the vierbein and of a. similarly, the constraint h v , ii = 0 removed a
spinor doublet from the degrees of freedom of i, but this breaks the ssymmetry,
and thus the gravitino still has 24 degrees of freedom. as a result, the superconformal
invariance is reduced to superpoincare. the superpoincare multiplet contains the
abi. similarly the other internal products with v
graviphoton, which resides in h v , f 

16

can be seen as auxiliary elds of the 40+40 o-shell superpoincare multiplet. in other
formulations [19, 7] they are expressed in terms of another compensating multiplet.
this compensating multiplet is then also used to gauge x the su(2) invariance which
we have not broken here.

3.3.4 further variations of constraints in the special case

now we continue the analysis of the supersymmetry transformations on special kahler
constraints for supergravity theories with zz = hv, uzi 6= 0. this can only happen for
n = 1, because that is the only case where this condition is not equivalent with (1.12).
because n = 1, u and d can be replaced by uz and dz.

the computation of the special kahler constraint goes along the same track as for
the generic case, but extra terms appear because of the weaker constraint. the new

4 the generalised bianchi identities combined with

the special kahler constraints

in this section we start by imposing the reduction constraints on the chiral multiplets.
because the constraints on the eld strengths are bianchi identities, this linear multiplet
of constraints is called the generalised bianchi identities. we combine these constraints
with the special kahler constraints of section 3. together they give the eld equations
of n vector multiplets and expressions for the auxiliary elds i and d. we derive
this for the generic case hv, ui = 0. we comment on the supergravity equations of
motion in this generic case. finally, we give the equations for the special case where
hv, ui 6= 0.

4.1 the eld equations for the generic case

to see what follows from equations (2.11)(2.14), we take the symplectic inner product
of these equations with the basis w. the 4 components of equation (a.6) give 4
equations for each constraint.

19

from the rst identity we learn that the section yij is totally constrained, as it

should be because it is auxiliary. we have

yij = ig hc 
i 

j

u   c  ikjl

klui .

(4.1)

it is more interesting to take a look at (2.12). taking the symplectic inner product
of this equation with all components of the basis w (3.3), and using the special kahler
constraints of section 3.3 and (4.1) gives:

h v , ii = 0 ,

is the kahler 1-form.

the rst two equations in (4.2) imply with (3.42) and (3.41) that all components
of i are expressed in terms of other elds, and thus they are no independent degrees
of freedom. the third expresses i in terms of other elds.
in a superconformal
calculation using a lagrangian, this expression for i can be found from the equation
of motion of the fermion of the compensating vector multiplet. the fourth equation is
the eld equation for n fermion doublets 
i .

we now proceed with the analysis of (2.13). we rst repeat that (3.40) implies
that there are (n + 1) independent antisymmetric tensors in the symplectic vector fab.
apart from these there is another antiselfdual tensor in the weyl multiplet t ij
ab. a few
denitions make (2.13) more transparent. first dene the combination in brackets as

f ab = fab + 1

4 v tab ijij + 1

4

v t ij

abij .

(4.5)

20

then we take out covariantisation terms:

fab =

f ab  2( i[aj

b]ij + v i

aj

bij + h.c.) .

(4.6)

this is chosen such that covariant derivatives in (2.13) can be rewritten as ordinary
derivatives, and the equation reduces to

 f = 0 .

(4.7)

applying this on the n + 1 independent components of f, implies that they can
be expressed in terms of n + 1 vectors. the other (n + 1) equations of (4.7) are the
equivalent of eld equations for these vectors. here, it is clear how our formulation
keeps the symplectic covariance. only in the interpretation we distinguish one half of
the equations as bianchi identities and the others as eld equations. these could have
been interchanged giving the magnetic dual formulation. also the fact whether or
not a prepotential exists is hidden here. the dierence is seen only when breaking the
symplectic formulation in nding an explicit solution of the equations (3.40). if the
(n + 1) (n + 1)-matrix, formed by the upper part of (v , u) is invertible, then (3.40)
expresses the (n + 1) lower components of f 
ab in terms of the upper ones. this is the
case that there is a prepotential. when this matrix is not invertible7, then one can still
solve (3.40) for other (n + 1) components of f 
ab.
depend also on the 6 degrees of freedom of the tensor t ij

we thus conclude that we have n + 1 on-shell vectors and their eld equations

ab of the weyl multiplet.

now let us have a look at (2.14). it involves the covariant laplacian,

the rst two equations, together with (3.44) and (3.43) (which can be simplied using
the second equations in (4.2)) determine that c is completely determined in terms of
other elds. the real and imaginary part of the third equation have both to be 0.
the real part constraints the divergence of q  a, and the imaginary part gives
 -term.)
an expression for the d-eld of the weyl multiplet.
the fourth equation of the expansion in terms of w gives the eld equations for n
complex scalars. so we nd the same structure in the equations as for the fermions:
n + 1 equations express c in terms of other elds, while the n + 1 other equations give
the eld equations for n complex scalars z, an expression for d and a constraint for
(q  a). the degrees of freedom are described in table 3.

using the results of the previous section, we comment on the appearance of equations
of motion for the remaining 24+24 components of table 3 from one symplectic invariant

(4.10)

which gives rise to a 24+24 current multiplet. the -sign is used to denote that
we only expose the linear terms. this already shows the essential features of this
symplectic covariant formulation. with the linearised approximation we mean that we
keep terms with an arbitrary power of undierentiated scalar elds or metric, but only
linear in other elds. in a full treatment of n = 2 supergravity couplings the r.h.s. of
(4.10) would e.g. contain an additional coupling to hypermultiplets.

to discuss the supersymmetry partners of (4.10), we derive a new n = 2 multi-
plet with 24 + 24 components. the multiplet starting with the symplectic expression
hv, f +
abi is a supergravity realisation of this multiplet. as shown below the supermulti-
plet of constraints derived from (4.10) is only equivalent to the supergravity equations
of motion, up to integration constants. these 8+8 remaining unknowns can be de-
termined when one of the three possibilities of a second compensating multiplet is
introduced as in [19, 7, 9]. in our approach this is the place where the second compen-
sating multiplet, which is also needed for consistency in the lagrangian formulation,
comes into play.

terms of the traceless symmetric part f(ab) with 9 components. the fermion abi has
again 24 lefthanded components and c +
ab has 6. so, this is a chiral multiplet with
48 + 48 components.

the transformation rules of this multiplet are the same as for a chiral multiplet
with a complex scalar as lowest component, but with the components straightforwardly
replaced:

since we have broken superconformal symmetry to super-poincare and su(2), we only
need a super-poincare version of this multiplet. note that it can not be extended to
a superconformal one. the commutator of a supersymmetry and a special supersym-
metry has to give a lorentz transformation that can never be realised because of the
duality and chirality properties of the spinors. for this reason, it is only possible to
construct an antiselfdual chiral tensor multiplet, realising the superconformal algebra,
as given in [22].

to study the eld equations of the elds of table 3, we need a multiplet with 24 + 24

components. a suitable multiplet of constraints is:

0 = a(babij + ikjl bkl

in deriving this multiplet we used the constraints of sections 3 and 4. the expression for

of su(2)-vectors. the expression for fab

of table 3. the counting in this table subtracts the gauge degrees of freedom. the
multiplet here is a multiplet of curvatures and the counting is equivalent if we take into
account the bianchi identities.

however, our equations are not equivalent to the complete supergravity equations
of motion. they dier modulo integration constants. these can be determined when

a second compensating multiplet is coupled [7, 19]. since this step is independent of
the symplectic formulation of the coupling of vector multiplets to supergravity, we do
not treat it here.

let us give a brief discussion of the content of the equations following from (4.10).

the additional 8+8 remaining unknowns can be determined through the eld equa-

supergravity equations of motion.

4.3 the eld equations for the special case

in this subsection, the expressions of section 4.1 are generalised for the case n = 1
where further zz = hv, uzi 6= 0. this is the case that was excluded by the former
denitions and where our less restrictive denitions becomes relevant. the equations
are found by expanding the constraints in terms of the basis of symplectic vectors using
the methods mentioned at the end of the appendix.

the section yij remains totally constrained:

yij = gz z(cid:16)  iikjlgz zdz zz  kzlzv + igz zdzzz  z
i z
j

+iikjl cz zz kzlzuz  iczzz z

this equation reduces to the former equation (4.1) when hv, uzi = 0.

the equations that can be derived from the constraints for the fermions are the

following ones:

h v , ii = dz zz  ij/z  j z ,
z, ii = ij cz zz/z  j z + 1

(4.31)

also here, the equations reduce to the ones that we have found for the generic case
where hv, uzi = 0. the same comments as in section 4.1 are valid here.

repeating the analysis for the equations of the vectors, it appears that there is
no information used about zz. this means that the analysis of the equations for the
vectors of section 4.1 remains valid. this is no surprise because the equations for the
vectors are a symplectic section of equations. all the other equations are singlets for
the symplectic group and can therefore be written as symplectic invariant equations.

also the last constraint can be decomposed with respect to the symplectic basis.

then the equations become:

the metric in front of the kinetic term of the scalar in the fourth equation is positive
because of the physical condition (3.2). again, all these equations reduce to the equa-
tions of section 4.1 if zz = 0 and the same conclusions can be drawn as in section 4.1.
therefore we conclude at this point that the special case is a valid alternative for a
theory with n = 2 supergravity and one vector multiplet.

5 conclusions

we have presented a fully symplectic invariant formulation of the coupling of an arbi-
trary number n of vector multiplets to n = 2 supergravity in 4 dimensions by using
superconformal tensor calculus. this approach does not start from a prepotential,
but rather from a 2(n + 1) symplectic vector of chiral superconformal multiplets. we
imposed the reducibility constraints (2.11)-(2.14) of chiral multiplets in supergravity
to end up with vector multiplets in a superconformal background. furthermore, we
imposed the symplectic covariant dening equations of special kahler geometry, and
supersymmetric partners thereof. the bosonic dening equations include a breaking of
dilatations and u(1)-transformations, the special conformal symmetry being broken as
usual by imposing a constraint (3.23) on the dilatational gauge eld. in the fermionic
sector, one of the constraints, (3.26), breaks special supersymmetry. this results in
unbroken poincare supersymmetry and su(2) gauge symmetry. the other constraints
are determined by demanding the preservation of the poincare supersymmetry.

the combination of all the special kahler constraints (1.4)-(1.7) and their super-
symmetric partners with the generalised bianchi identities of the chiral multiplets gave
rise to a full set of eld equations for the vector multiplet elds.

furthermore, we discussed also part of the equations of motion for the gravity
sector. this could be done by imposing a new symplectic constraint (4.10) and its su-
persymmetric partners. the full analysis would need a second compensating multiplet.
finally, we did the same analysis for a weaker denition of the special kahler
constraints where the constraint (1.7) is replaced by (1.12). this is a weaker constraint
for the case of one physical vector multiplet. in appendix c of [17] two examples were
given where (1.7) is not satised. they are not suitable for illustrating non-trivial
aspects of our construction. the rst example does not fulll the positivity condition
(3.2). the second example does agree with our denition, but is trivial in the sense

29

that there dzuz = 0. therefore, the extra terms that appear in this paper are absent
for this model. a nontrivial realisation of our new models is still lacking.

a a basis for symplectic vectors

in this appendix we show that

w = (v, u, v , u )

(a.1)

is a basis for symplectic vectors. since we are dealing with a 2(n + 1) dimensional
vector space we only have to show that these vectors are independent.
proof: suppose

0v + 0 v + u +   u  = 0 ,

(a.2)

then it follows that all i = 0 if and only if the determinant obtained by left symplectic
inner products with, respectively, v , v , u  and u, is nonzero:


h v , u i

0

0
i

i
0
0

det





h u , v i

0

hv, ui
ig 

0
0

0

ig 

6= 0 .



(a.3)

(a.4)

(a.5)

hu, v i
we can split this up in two cases:
1. the generic case :
then hv, ui = 0, and (a.3) is

(det g )2 > 0 ,

which is satised by the metric.
2. the special case :
then we dene zz = hv, uzi and the determinant equation leads to

(gz z  zz zz)2 6= 0 .

however this follows from the physical condition on the sections that leads to the
right signs for the kinetic energy of the scalars and the vectors, cf. (3.2).

now that we have a basis, we can expand every symplectic vector in this basis.
take a generic symplectic vector xa, where the index a denotes a generic index. it is
again useful to separate two cases.
1. the generic case :
this leads to

xa = ih v , xaiv  ihv, xai v

+ig (cid:16)hu, xai u   h u , xaiu(cid:17) .

31

(a.6)

2. the special case :
in the basis w, the expansion becomes

xa = igz z (gz zh v , xai + i zhuz, xai)v

+(gz zhv, xai + izh uz, xai) v
+(i zhv, xai + h uz, xai)uz
(izh v , xai + huz, xai) uz! .

in this case we better use the basis

w  = (v, u 

z, v , u 

z) .

(a.7)

(a.8)

the same formulas hold as above, when replacing g  with g

z z.
