(june 99)

in this work we derive certain topological theories of transverse vector

elds whose amplitudes reproduce topological invariants involving the inter-

actions among the trajectories of three and four random walks. this result

is applied to the construction of a eld theoretical model which describes the

statistical mechanics of an arbitrary number of topologically linked polymers

in the context of the analytical approach of edwards. with respect to previous

attempts, our approach is very general, as it can treat a system involving an

arbitrary number of polymers and the topological states are not only specied

by the gauss linking number, but also by higher order topological invariants.

i. introduction

topologically linked random chains are studied in connection with physical systems in

which the topological constraints of one-dimensional objects play an essential role [1], [2].

examples are vortex rings in uids and dislocation lines in solids. to be concrete, the theory

of random chains is applied here to the description of polymers in a good solvent [3] [5],

where the random chains are subjected to excluded volume interactions and topological

interactions [1], [6] [7]. the former take into account the eective repulsions experienced

by the polymers, while the latter arise due to presence of stable topological constraints in

the system.

in a recent publication [8], the so-called analytical approach of edwards [9] has been

extended to the case of n entangling polymers, mapping the statistical mechanical problem

1

of computing their free energy to a eld theoretical problem. the model obtained in this

way is a o(n) eld theory coupled to chern-simons (c-s) terms [10] in the limit n  0. at

one loop approximation, one nds that the topological interactions tend to counterbalance

the repulsive eects of the excluded volume forces. this eect has been indeed observed in

nature, for instance in the dna of some bacteria, which forms topologically entangled rings

[11]. moreover, one can compute the second topological momentum of two polymers exactly.

the analytical approach of edwards is however limited by the fact that the topological

states of the system are distinguished using the gauss linking number. the latter is a

relatively poor topological invariant and describes topological interactions in which only the

trajectories of two polymers are involved. despite many eorts [12] [21], the inclusion in the

treatment of topological random walks of more sophisticated link invariants, like for instance

the alexander and jones polynomials [22], [23], has not yet been achieved. the reason is

that higher order link invariants have no immediate relation to the physical conformations

of the polymers in the space [17]. a remedy invoked by many authors is the introduction

of c-s eld theories coupled to the polymer trajectories [1], [7]. unfortunately, this is not a

simple task. first of all, the amplitudes of non-abelian c-s eld theories contain topological

invariants [24], but it is not clear how to use them to impose constraints on the congurations

of the system. on the other side, it is not easy to nd a regularization or a mechanism that

suitably removes the spurious non-topological contributions arising in c-s eld theories. for

example, the introduction of a framing [24] complicates the integrations over the polymer

trajectories to the extent that the mapping of the statistical mechanics of the system to a

eld theory is no longer possible [25].

to solve the above diculties, we propose here interacting abelian eld theories contain-

ing transverse vector elds. such theories are topological but not gauge invariant. of course,

since the radiative corrections are not protected by a gauge principle, counter-terms may

arise which are of a non-topological nature. to exclude this possibility, the couplings among

the vector elds are chosen so that every quantum contribution disappears.

in this way

one is able to construct theories whose amplitudes are purely classical and, in principle, can

2

generate topological terms describing interactions among an arbitrary number of random

chains. apart from a constant factor, each of these terms can be identied with the contri-

bution of a tree-level feynman diagram appearing in a non-abelian c-s eld theory [26]

[27]. however, it is exactly the freedom of choosing these factors that allows the xing of the

topological costraints. the above ndings are used to build a model of entangling polymers

in which the topological interactions induced by the gauss linking invariant in the standard

edward approach are corrected by higher order topological interactions among three trajec-

tories. the corresponding topological invariant has a simple physical interpretation which is

expressed in terms of magnetic elds generated by ctitious charged particles moving along

the trajectories of the polymers. a generalization to the case of four trajectories is also

outlined.

the material presented in this paper is divided as follows. in the next section we explain

the treatment of the n polymers problem of [8] based on the use of the gauss linking number

to distinguish the topological states. with respect to [8] some new investigations are made.

for instance, the role of the c-s elds as propagators of the collective modes which are

relevant in the topological entanglement [19] is explored in details. in section three that

approach is extended to include also higher order topological interactions. to this purpose,

abelian theories are dened that generate topological interactions among three and four

loops. finally, the conclusions are drawn in section four.

ii. the n polymers problem

let p1, . . . , pn be a set of topologically entangling random chains at thermal equilibrium.

if the step length a of the segments composing the chains is very small, one can describe

the chains as trajectories in the space parametrized by vectors ri(si), i = 1, . . . , n and

continuous parameters s1, . . . , sn such that:

0  si  li

ri(0) = r

i, ri(li) = ri

(1)

3

li coincides with the contour length of ci. in rst approximation the topological constraints

will be imposed exploiting the gauss linking number:

(ci, cj) 

1

4 z li

0

z lj

0

dri(si)  drj(sj) 

(ri(si)  rj(sj))
|ri(si)  rj(sj)|3

and requiring the conditions:

(ci, cj) = mij

(2)

(3)

where mij = mji, mii = 0 are a set of topological numbers.

to describe the statistical mechanics of the chains we dene the conguration probability

g{m}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0). this function measures the probability that the trajectories ci have

extrema (in the open case) at the points r

i and ri or a xed point (in the closed case)

in r

i = ri for i = 1, . . . , n. moreover, they should fulll the topological conditions (3).

in our notations {m} denotes the n  n symmetric matrix of topological numbers, while

{r} = r1, . . . , rn , {l} = l1, . . . , ln etc.

in the path integral approach one obtains the

following expression of g{m}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0) [8]:

g{m}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0) = z r1

where the v0

ij are coupling constants with the dimension of a volume. the fourier trans-

formed of g{m}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0) with respect to the parameters mij is:

(9)

following the approach of edwards, one would like to transform the above path integral into

a eld theoretical problem. first of all, we treat the excluded volume interactions. to this

purpose, we introduce n gaussian scalar elds 1(r), . . . , n (r), with action

a =

a2
2

n

xi,j=1z d3ri[(v0)1]ijj

(10)

the fundamental identity which relates the excluded volume term to a eld theory amplitude

is:

eaev = z d1 . . . dn exp(a{}  i

n

xi=1ici

dsii(ri(si)))

(11)

in the case of topological interactions one needs instead chern-simons elds a(i)

(j) and b(i)

(j)

with action:

scs =

n 1

n

xi=1

xj=2

j>i

a(i)

(j)  (  b(i)

(12)

the c-s theory will be quantized in the landau gauge, where the elds are completely

transverse. in the coupling with the random chains only the following linear combinations

of elds are relevant:

c(1) =

(13)

(14)

(15)

the topological term appearing in the congurational probability (8) can be rewritten as

an amplitude of the above c-s eld theory as follows:

z dadb exp(iscs  i

exploiting the identities (11) and (16) the congurational probability (8) becomes:

g{}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0) = h

(18)

(19)

(20)

as we see from eqs. (18) the trajectories c1, . . . , cn are completely decoupled before averag-

ing over the auxiliary elds {}, {a}, {b}. formally, g(ri, li; r

i, 0|i, c(i)) is the evolution

kernel of the random walk of a particle in an electromagnetic eld (ii, c(i)). thus, it

satises the pseudo-schrodinger equation [14]:

6

" 

li



a

d2

i + ii# g(ri, li; r

i, 0|i, c(i)) = (li)(ri  r
i)

the covariant derivatives di appearing in the above equation are given by:

di =  + ic(i)

i = 1, . . . , n

(21)

(22)

it is now convenient to perform a laplace transformation of g(ri, li; r

i, 0|i, c(i)) with

respect to the length li:

g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i)) = z 

0

dliezilig(ri, li; r

i, 0|i, c(i))

(23)

accordingly, we are now considering the laplace transformed congurational probability:

g{}({r}, {r}, {z}) = z +

0

dl1 . . .z +

0

dln exp(

n

xi=1

zili) g{}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0)

(24)

since the order of the integrations over the auxiliary elds and the lengths li of the trajec-

tories can be permuted, we have:

g{}({r}, {r}, {z}) = h

n

yi=1

g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i))i{},{a},{b}

(25)

the new variables zi play the role of boltzmann-like factors which govern the distribution

lengths of the random chains. the advantage of having performed the laplace transforma-

tions is that g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i)) satises a stationary pseudo schrodinger equation:

[zi  hi] g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i)) = (ri  r
i)

here the hamiltonian hi is given by:

hi =

a
6

d2

i  ii

(26)

(27)

the solution of eq. (26) can now be expressed in terms of second quantized elds elds



i , i, i = 1, . . . , n:

g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i)) = z 1

i

z did

i i(ri)

i (r

(28)

where f [i] represents the ginzburg-landau free energy of a superconductor in a uctuating

magnetic eld:

f [i] = z d3r(cid:20) a

6

|dii|2 + (zi + ii)|i|2(cid:21)

and zi is the partition function of the system:

zi = z did

i ef [i]

(29)

(30)

the auxiliary elds i can be eliminated from the congurational probability (25) integrating

them out. the integration over these elds is non-trivial due to the presence of the factors

z 1

i

in the second quantized expression of g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i)) in (28), but can be made

gaussian by exploiting the identity [28]:

z 1

i = lim
ni0

z ni1

in this way

g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i)) == lim
ni0

z ni1

i

z did

i i(ri)

i (r

i)ef [i]

(31)

(32)

the above equation should be understood as follows: the right hand side is rst computed

supposing that the replica index ni is an arbitrary positive integer and then one performs the

analytic continuation of the result to the point ni = 0. now g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i)) is a product

of ni path integrals. to each one we associate a set of replica elds ai

i , ai = 1, . . . , ni, so

that it will be convenient to introduce the multiplets:

i = (1

i , . . . , ni
i )



i = (1

i

, . . . , ni

i

)

and to rewrite g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i)) as follows:

g(ri, r

i; zi|i, c(i)) = lim

ni0z did

(36)

(37)

according to the replica method, one supposes that it is possible to commute the limit of van-

ishing replica index with the path integrations over the auxiliary elds. thus, substituting

eq. (35) in (25) and performing the integration over the scalars i, which is now gaussian,

one obtains the nal expression of the congurational probability g{}({r}, {r}, {z}):

g{}({r}, {r}, {z}) =

(38)

agauss is the free energy of the topologically linked random walk written in terms of c-s

and second quantized elds. the subscript refers to the fact that the topological constraints

have been imposed using the gauss linking number. after a rescaling the complex scalar

elds of the kind

where m is a mass parameter, the explicit expression of agauss is:

(40)

where

(41)

the above action describes a o(n) model coupled to chern-simons elds in the limit n = 0.

the analogous of the planck constant is here the constant h = m a

3 and has been set equal

to one in (40). the topological elds are not just auxiliary, but play a physical role, since

they propagate the long-range interactions that impose the topological constraints (3). one

may argue at this point that the number of c-s elds used in the present approach, which

is n(n  1), is highly redundant with respect to the physical number of degrees of freedom

involved if n > 3. this number can be computed exploiting refs. [19], [20], where a set of

collective modes which are relevant in the topological interactions has been constructed in

terms of the so-called bond vector densities:

ui(r) = ici

dri(r  ri)

i = 1, . . . , n

(42)

more precisely, the collective modes are linear combinations of the n bond vector densities

in the fourier space, where

ui(q) = ici

drie1qri

i = 1, . . . , n

indeed, the gauss linking invariant (2) can be expressed as follows:

(ci, cj) = z d3q

q2

q  (ui(q)  uj(q))

(43)

(44)

as a consequence, if there is a number m  n of random chains which have non-trivial

topological relations with the others, i. e. the maximum rank of the matrices {mij} and

{ij} is m, there are at most m degrees of freedom to be propagated. of course, this is

not in contradiction with our result. as a matter of fact it is possible to see that, exploiting

the equations of motions, the number of c-s elds in the action (40) can be reduced to n.

however, the c-s theory obtained in this way is not universal, since it cannot describe all the

topological states of the system. the reason is that after the reduction the c-s propagators

depend on the parameters ij and become singular in the limit in which some of them vanish.

in general, it has not been possible to build a suitable abelian c-s eld theory with less

10

than n(n  1) elds without encountering the problem of diverging propagators wherever

rank[] < n or without resorting to a complicated parameterization of the matrix {}

provided for instance by the solution of the following algebraic system of equations:

ij =

ikkj

n

xk=1

(45)

iii. including higher loop interactions

the gauss linking number describes a topological interaction between two loops and it

is quite a poor topological invariants. thus it would be interesting to include in the above

approach also higher order topological interactions. to begin, we consider an interaction

3(ci, cj, ck) among three loops, where i < j < k. to determine 3(ci, cj, ck) we construct

a suitable topological eld theory with action:

s3(i, j, k) = z d3xa(i)

(jk) a(i)

(jk) + z d3xb(j)

(ik)b(j)

(ik)

(ij) c(k)

(ij) + k

ijz d3xa(i)

(jk)b(j)

(ik)c(k)

(ij)

(46)

z d3xc(k)
(jk), . . . , c(k)

where the elds a(i)

(ij) are purely transverse. s3(i, j, k) describes at the classical

level a topological eld theory which is not gauge invariant. moreover, it is easy to convince

oneself that the theory has no radiative corrections that could spoil its topological properties.

despite of this fact, there are nontrivial amplitudes as for instance the following correlator:

gi

jk

(ci, cj, ck) = he

ikhci

dr
i a

(i)
(jk)(ri)

e

ikhcj

dr
j

(j)
b
(ik)(rj )

the above amplitude can be exactly computed and one obtains:

gi

jk

(ci, cj, ck) = expni

jk(ci, cj, ck)o

where

(47)

(48)

(49)

and

i(ri, rj, rk) = z d3rg(r  ri)g(r  rj)g(r  rk)

in the above equation

g(r1  r2) = 

(r1  r2)
|r1  r2|3

(50)

(51)

r being the components of the vector r. an analogous of (ci, cj, ck) in the case ci = cj =

ck has been studied in connection with perturbative calculations of self-linking invariants

in non-abelian c-s eld theories. after a volume integration in (50), the right hand side of

eq. (49) has a complicated expression, which has been evaluated in [27]. with respect to

[27], however, one does not need path ordering of the trajectories, so that it is possible to

perform the volume integration using a dierent strategy. to this purpose, let us dene the

currents:

and the magnetic elds:

j

(l)(r)  icl

dr

l (r  rl)

b(l)(r) = icl

dr (r  rl)
|r  rl|3

(52)

(53)

with  ~b(l) = 0 and  ~b(l) = 4j(l). the vector potentials corresponding to these magnetic

elds are:

~a(l)(r) = icl

ad satisfy the relations

drl

|r  rl|3 = z d3r j(l)(r)

|r  r|

  ~a(l) = 0

  ~a(l) = ~b(l)

 ~a(l) = 4j(l)

in terms of the magnetic elds b

(l) we have:

12

(54)

(55)

(56)

(ci, cj, ck) = z d3r ~b(i)(r)  ~b(j)(r)  ~b

(k)(r)

(57)

the space integral can be eliminated using the stokes theorem and after some calculations

one obtains:

1
4

(ci, cj, ck) = z zck

dsk  ~b(i)(rk)  ~b(j)(rk) +z zcj

dsj  ~b(i)(rj)  ~b(k)(rj)

z zci

dsi  ~b(j)(ri)  ~b(k)(ri)

(58)

where the ci, cj , ck are arbitrary surfaces having respectively ci, cj, ck as borders and

innitesimal surface elements dsi, dsj, dsk. to include the interactions among the loop

trajectories, we extend the previous congurational probability of eq. (4) as follows:

g{m,m }({r}, {l}; {r}, 0) = z r1

. . .z rn

(59)

after performing the fourier transformations with respect to the topological numbers mij

and mijk one obtains:

g{}({r}, {l}; {r}, 0) = z r1

r

(60)

(61)

at this point we rewrite the higher loop topological interactions appearing in (60) as a eld

theory amplitude using eqs. (48) and (49):

(63)

again, the c-s elds decouple the topological interactions. the integration over the tra-

jectories of the random chains can now be performed following the same strategy of the

previous section.

in this way one obtains the following expression of the congurational

probability in terms of the laplace variables z1, . . . , zn :

g{,}({r}, {r}, {z}) =

(67)

we notice that within the above approach it is possible to include also topological interac-

tions among four or more trajectories. let us consider for instance a topological four loop

interaction (c1, c2, c3, c4). to generate such interaction we dene the following action:

(68)

as in the previous case, the theory is topological but has no gauge invariance. this can be

dangerous, since radiative corrections may arise which spoil the topological properties of the

theory, but it is easy to see that the above theory has no quantum contributions.

eq. (71) describes a topological interaction among four loops. unfortunately, the elimination

of the double volume integral has not been possible following the strategy of section ii. for

this reason, an expression of (c1, c2, c3, c4) in terms of the magnetic elds (53) could not

be derived.

iv. conclusions

in the rst part of this work the statistical mechanical problem of a system of n polymers

whose topological interactions are governed by the gauss linking number has been mapped

to a eld theory following ref. [8]. in the model obtained in this way the c-s elds play a

physical role, since they mediate the topological forces which impose the constraints (3). we

15

notice that the relation (16), which expresses the topological contributions appearing in the

rst quantized version of the congurational probability (8) in terms of eld amplitudes, can

be reproduced also by means of other abelian c-s eld theories. each of these theories diers

from the other by the number of elds. however, the requirement that their propagators

should not diverge when rank[] < n implies that the independent elds should be at least

n(n  1). on the other side, if one starts with n > n(n  1) c-s elds, it is always

possible to reduce their number to n(n  1) by exploiting the equations of motion. for this

reason, the model of topologically entangling polymers given by eqs. (38)(41) is unique.

in section ii the eld theories are essential in order to decouple the random chains

and to rewrite the congurational probability in a second quantized form. however, they

start to play an even more active role in section iii. in fact, here the eld amplitudes are

fundamental to provide the explicit expression of the topological interactions among three or

more polymer trajectories. in the case of a three loop interaction, the topological invariant

(ci, cj, ck) has also a nice physical interpretation in terms of magnetic elds given by

eq. (58) as the gauss linking invariant. with respect to non-abelian c-s eld theories,

the advantage of the theories of transverse vector elds dened here is the possibility of

generating single topological invariants (ci, cj, ck) without the problem of spurious non-

topological contributions or of higher order corrections. moreover, the freedom to choose

the parameters i

jk is crucial in order to impose constraints on the (ci, cj, ck) as shown

by eqs. (59) and (60).

concluding, the eld theoretical approach illustrated in this paper solves in principle the

most serious drawback present in the analytical approach of edwards, i. e. the use of the

gauss linking invariant to specify the topological status of a system of random chains. how-

ever, more work and, possibly, numerical simulations are still needed in order to evaluate

the phenomenological implications of the new topological terms introduced in the congu-

rational probability (64) and to make contact with experiments.
