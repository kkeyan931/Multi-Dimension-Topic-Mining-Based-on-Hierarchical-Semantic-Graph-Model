abstract

we demonstrate an unambiguous and robust method for computing fermionic
corrections to the energies of classical background eld congurations. we
consider the particular case of a sequence of background eld congurations
that interpolates continuously between the trivial vacuum and a widely sep-
arated soliton/antisoliton pair in 1+1 dimensions. working in the contin-
uum, we use phase shifts, the born approximation, and levinsons theorem
to avoid ambiguities of renormalization procedure and boundary conditions.
we carry out the calculation analytically at both ends of the interpolation
and numerically in between, and show how the relevant physical quantities
vary continuously.
in the process, we elucidate properties of the fermionic
phase shifts and zero modes.

i. introduction

1+1 dimensional models have pointed out many subtleties in the computation of one-loop
fermionic quantum corrections to the energies of classical eld congurations. many works,
usually in the context of supersymmetric theories [1], have reached conicting conclusions
about the correct boundary conditions, regularization and renormalization procedures, and
bound state and continuum contributions. since the one-loop energy is given by the cancel-
lation of a divergent sum of zero-point energies against a divergent counterterm, one must
be extremely careful to x the counterterm with a denite renormalization scheme in order
to obtain a physically meaningful result.

in this paper we extend the methods of ref. [2,3] to this case. we again nd that
1+1 dimensional models provide an excellent testing ground for our methods, and can give
considerable insight into the causes and resolutions of the disagreements among the previous
results. as in our previous works, we will use a continuum formalism based on phase shifts,
their born approximations, and levinsons theorem. relying on such physical quantities
results in a procedure that is both analytically unambiguous and numerically robust. as a
result, we will be able to compare numerical results in generic, but not exactly soluble cases
to analytic results in specic, exactly soluble cases.

we will consider a majorana fermion coupled to a real scalar background eld, with
a denite choice of bosonic and fermionic potentials, though our method applies equally
well for any other choice of potentials, as well as for complex scalars and dirac fermions
(including cases without c or cp invariance). we will consider a continuous sequence
of scalar eld congurations that interpolates between a trivial background and a widely
separated soliton/antisoliton pair, always with the same, trivial eld conguration as x 
. in this way we can unambiguously track physical quantities such as phase shifts and
bound state energies, staying in the trivial sector of the theory throughout the process.
in so doing, we obtain results numerically that continuously approach the results obtained
analytically in ref. [4].

in ii we develop the methods we will need to compute phase shifts, which in turn allow
us to compute the renormalized one-loop energy as a sum over zero-point energies  1
2 . in
iii we apply these methods to the specic sequence of eld congurations we have chosen
and obtain numerical and analytical results. in iv we summarize our results, and connect
them to previous and future works. the appendix contains techniques parallel to those of
ii but for a single soliton instead of a soliton/antisoliton pair.

ii. fermionic small oscillations and phase shifts

we consider a majorana fermion  interacting with a scalar background eld , with

the classical lagrangian density

l =

m2

2 (cid:16)i /  m  + l(cid:17)

(1)

where l is the lagrangian density for the  background eld. as discussed in the intro-
duction, we can treat any bosonic potential. to be specic, we choose

2

(2  1)2
which has classical soliton (antisoliton) solutions satisfying

(x) =  tanh

.

(4)

for the most part, we will be treating  as a classical background, so that its dynamics
will be unimportant. however, we note that choosing the lagrangian density of eq. (2)
causes the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom to be related by supersymmetry for a
background eld that is a solution to the equations of motion (such as a single soliton or an
innitely separated soliton/antisoliton pair). in what follows, we will nd it instructive to
compare the bosonic and fermionic small oscillations spectra. the supersymmetric model is
discussed in more detail in ref. [4].

the one-loop corrections to the energy due to fermionic uctuations will be given by
the appropriately renormalized sum of the zero-point energies,  1
2 , of the fermionic small
oscillations. the spectrum of fermionic small oscillations in a background 0(x) is given by
the dirac equation,

0 i1 d

dx

+ vf (x)! k(x) = f

k k(x)

(5)

where vf (x) = m0(x) is the fermionic potential and k = 2  m2 is the momentum

labeling the scattering states.

we will choose the convention 0 = 2 and 1 = i3 so that the majorana condition
becomes simply  = . we note that since our lagrangian is cp invariant, all of our
results for the spectrum of a majorana fermion can be extended to a dirac fermion simply
by doubling.

our primary tool for analyzing the small oscillations will be the phase shifts. we can
solve for the phase shifts of any fermionic potential vf (x) that satises vf (x) = vf (x)
and vf (x)  m as x   by generalizing the methods of ref. [2] to fermions. this form
will be useful for considering our example of a sequence of background eld congurations
that continuously interpolates between the trivial vacuum and a widely separated soliton-
antisoliton pair. in the limit of innite separation, the phase shift for the pair goes to twice
the result for a single soliton. for comparison, we also do the computation for a single
soliton directly in the appendix.

we dene the parity operator acting on fermionic states as p = 0, where  sends
x  x. p commutes with the hamiltonian, so parity is a good quantum number. as a
result, we can separate the small oscillations into positive and negative parity channels, now
restricted to k > 0 in the continuum.

we parameterize the fermion wavefunction by

(x) = (cid:18) ei(x)

iei(x)ei(cid:19) eikx

where  = tan1 k
each channel (k) by solving eq. (5) subject to the boundary conditions

with the boundary condition that (x) and (x) vanish at innity. the total phase shift is
given by summing the phase shifts in each channel, f (k) = +(k) + (k).

our calculation also requires us to nd the bound state energies, which we do by solv-
ing eq. (5) using ordinary shooting methods. however, once we know the phase shifts,
levinsons theorem tells us how many bound states there will be. it works exactly the same
way as in the bosonic case [4,5]: in the odd parity channel, the number of bound states n
is given by

while in the even parity channel the number of bound states n+ is given by

(0) = n

+(0) = (n+ 

1
2

).

(10)

(11)

one can derive this result either by the same jost function methods used in the boson
case, or by observing that at small k, the nonrelativistic approximation becomes valid so the
bosonic results carry over directly. for a particular potential there may exist a k = 0 state in
either of the two channels whose dirac wavefunction goes to a constant spinor as x  .
(generically, for k = 0 the components of the dirac wavefunction go to straight lines as
x  , but not lines with zero slope.) just as in the bosonic case, such threshold states
(which we term half bound states) should be counted with a factor of 1
2 in levinsons
theorem.

given the phase shifts and bound state energies, we can calculate the one-loop fermionic
correction to the energy. we work in a simple renormalization scheme in which we add a
counterterm proportional to 2  1, and perform no further renormalizations. the coun-
terterm is xed by requiring that the tadpole graph cancel. we must sum the zero-point
energies  1
2  of the small oscillations, subtract the same sum for the free case, and add the
contribution of the counterterm. as in ref. [24], we use the density of states

(k) = 0(k) +

(13)

where  = k2 + m2 and the sum over j counts bound states with appropriate factors of 1
as discussed above. next, we use eq. (10) and eq. (11) to rewrite this expression as

(14)

the (divergent) contribution from the tadpole graph is given by the leading born approx-
imation to f . since we have chosen the counterterm to exactly cancel the tadpole graph,
we can rewrite the counterterm contribution in terms of the born approximation, giving

1

(16)

which can also be obtained numerically by iterating eq. (9). as expected, it is indeed
proportional to 2  1.

iii. numerical results

we study a sequence of background elds labeled by a parameter x0 that continu-
ously interpolates from the trivial vacuum (x) = 1 at x0 = 0 to a widely separated
soliton/antisoliton pair at x0  ,

(x, x0) = 1 + tanh

fig. 1 shows the fermionic bound state energies as a function of x0. in the limit x0 
3
 two bound states approach energy m
2 . these are simply the odd and even parity
3
2 . the third (positive parity) bound
combinations of the single soliton bound state at m
state approaches  = 0 where the single soliton also has a bound state, but there is only one
such state (with  > 0). this is consistent with the result obtained analytically in ref. [4].
as emphasized in ref. [4], for a single soliton we must thus count the zero mode with a
factor of 1
2.

for any nite x0, levinsons theorem holds without subtleties; there are no states that

require factors of 1

2. thus for a large but nite x0, we nd

(0) = 

(18)

consistent with having two positive parity and one negative parity bound states (see fig. 1).
in the limit x0  , an even parity half-bound threshold state enters the spectrum at
 = m just as in the bosonic case [2]. also, in this limit, the lowest (positive parity) mode
approaches  = 0, and is only counted as a 1
2 as described above. finally, a negative parity
mode enters the spectrum from below, also to be weighted by 1
2.

thus the net change is to add half of a negative parity state, which via levinsons
theorem requires the phase shift (0) to jump from  to 3
2 as x0  . this jump occurs
by the same continuous but nonuniform process as in all cases where a new state gets bound,
which is illustrated in fig. 2. just as in the bosonic case, in the limit of innite separation
the potential we have chosen becomes reectionless, which requires +(k) = (k).

to contrast the behavior of the zero modes, fig. 3 shows 2 for the bound states of the
bosonic small oscillations [2]. because we have chosen the bosonic potential to be consistent
with supersymmetry, the bosonic and fermionic spectra are related. again as x0   the
bound state energies approach those of the single soliton, and the wavefunctions are formed
from the odd and even combinations of the wavefunctions for the single soliton. however,
3
we see that in the boson case both the mode at m
2 and the mode at  = 0 are doubled,
so there is no factor of 1
2 in counting the bosonic zero modes. for x0 above approximately
0.75/m, the system is unstable with respect to small oscillations in one direction in eld
space. this property is reected in the lowest bound state having 2 < 0 [2]. just as in the
fermionic case, in the limit x0  , a half-bound state enters the spectrum at  = m, and
the phase shifts in the two channels become equal as the potential becomes reectionless.
in the

x0   limit, we can also do the calculation analytically [4]. we nd a phase shift

discussion

we have shown how to compute one-loop fermionic contributions to the energies of sym-
metric background eld congurations. taking these methods together with those of ref. [2],
one can calculate the energy of a localized eld conguration in any model of scalars and
spinors in 1+1 dimensions. this procedure implements standard renormalization conditions
without ambiguity and lends itself to robust and ecient numerical calculation. a natu-
ral extension of this work is to treat translationally invariant classical eld congurations.
long ago, christ and lee showed how to quantize the small uctuations about momentum
eigenstates formed by taking superpositions of solutions to the classical equations of mo-
tion at dierent positions [6]. new problems arise when studying the eects of translation

8

invariance upon uctuations about time-independent classical eld congurations that are
not solutions to the classical equations of motion. work is underway to extend the above
techniques to the nonlocal potentials encountered in this case [7].

appendix: properties of a single soliton

as a check on the calculations presented in the body of the paper, we present the prop-
erties (phase shifts, eigenenergies, etc.) for a single soliton directly. in this case, we have
a potential that satises vf (x) = vf (x) with vf (x)  m as x  . we will use
the bosonic potentials that we obtain by squaring the dirac equation to obtain a result that
agrees with the previous method in the limit of a widely separated soliton/antisoliton pair.
we nd

are bosonic potentials.

since vf (x) is antisymmetric, both vb(x) and vb(x) are symmetric. we decompose their
solutions (as bosonic potentials) into symmetric and antisymmetric channels. for x  ,
we have
