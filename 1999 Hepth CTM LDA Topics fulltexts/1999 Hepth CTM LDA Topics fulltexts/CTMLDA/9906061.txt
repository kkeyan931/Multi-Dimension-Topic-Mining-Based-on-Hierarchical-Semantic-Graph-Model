(this coupling also considered .) one aims polyakov show second quantized string theory emerges due multivaluedness action b minkowski space. massive kalb-ramond eld b polyakovs action plays exactly role assigned . employing duality transformation beyond semiclassi- cal approximation (which used polyakov), working = 4, diamantini, quevedo trugenberger  rederived result polyakov, dual formulation compact qed (involving massive vector = 4) starting point.  (see also ) introduced rank 2 tensor elds yang-mills theories collective elds eld strength tensor f , analogy eld strength formulation yang-mills theories . using wilsonian exact renor- malization group equations (erges) presence collective elds argued  quadratic part wilsonian eective action infrared limit assumes particular form, equivalent quevedo-trugenberger polyakov action . non-trivial phenomenological test approach consists computation eld strength two-point function, given terms two-point function b , agrees well lattice results. aim present paper twofold: first, section 2, reconsider four- dimensional compact qed lattice. without passing dual formulation 2 involving massive vector eld, show directly, monopole condensation lets kalb-ramond eld b appear, rederive action explicit summation monopole congurations. approach also allows discuss expli- citly, vector-like gauge symmetries (under b transforms) together gauge xing terms appear formulation, b original gauge eld present action. emphasize role associated ward identity formulation. also discuss gauged away without modifying number degrees freedom, whereupon one recovers polyakovs formulation involving massive b eld without manifest gauge invariance. second, section 3, consider wilsonian erges yang-mills theories maximal abelian gauge, presence collective elds ba diagonal components eld strength tensor f (the index associated generators n 1 u(1) subgroups su(n)). present modied vector-like ward identity (depending explicitly wilsonian infrared cuto k) a) invariant erg ow, describes thus xed points (actual- ly still innite dimensional stable subclass) wilsonian eective actions, b) turns ward identity satised quevedo-trugenberger polyakov actions k 0. role ward identity wilsonian yang-mills eective action infrared limit discussed section 4. 2 compact qed let us start partition function compact qed lattice, following closely presentation polyakov . work = 4 euclidean dimensions; results can, however, straightforwardly carried arbitrary dimensions, sometimes let arbitrary. lattice lattice spacing = 1 action compact qed given = 1 2e2xx (1 cos f(x)) , sum , lattice site x understood, f = 3 (2.1) (2.2) lattice (forward) derivative. elds restricted do- main . neglecting higher powers f 2 periodicity cosine, partition function written  action, respecting z = xn (x)z + yx  e . (2.3) (f (x)2n (x))2 1 4e2px antisymmetric tensor n(x) represents set 6 independent integers (in = 4) lattice site. later convenience added gauge xing -function (a). due restricted domain integration gauge xing actually mandatory; amounts multiplication z nite factor per lattice site. next introduce hodge decomposition 6 independent integers n per lattice site: n =  + b . (2.4) vector satises = 0 represents thus 1 = 3 independent degrees freedom. antisymmetric tensor b satises b = 0, constitute 1 = 3 constraints = 4. remaining 3 degrees freedom b represented terms conserved monopole current density eq (with eq = 0) form integer monopole currents q, situated centres zi lattice cubes, related density eq eq(z) =xi q(zi) e(z zi) (2.7) e(z zi) denotes kronecker symbol, e(z zi) = 1 z = zi, e(z zi) = 0 otherwise. introducing dual eld strength h b, h = 1 2 b , (2.8) 4 integrating (2.5) lattice cube surface pi one obtains . 1 2 b = eq 2ipi 1 b = q(zi) . (2.5) (2.6) sum n partition function (2.3) replaced sums b, together corresponding constraints: yx hda (a) b (m) bd1 (b)i (f 22b )2 z = xm(x) xb (x)z + x eq(z)yz bd1 (h(z) eq(z)) e 1 4e2px . (2.9) b denote kronecker symbols, eld space. 1 dimensional kronecker symbol conserved vector v,bd1(v) v = 0, represented  e . (2.10) cv ipx bd1(v) = const.z + yx next combine gauge eld integers single eld , varies + lattice site: = + 2m . (2.11) point introduction gauge xing function (2.3) proves convenient. omitting primes , partition function becomes yx hda (a) bd1 (b)ix z = xb (x)z + 4e2px (f 2b )2 eq(z)yz bd1 (h(z) eq(z)) e 1 . (2.12) next aim explicit evaluation sum monopole current congura- tions eq(z). first, decompose possible congurations eq(z) congurations, nonvanishing n centres lattice cubes: = xn =0 1 n! xz1...zn xq(zi)6=0 x eq(z) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) eq(z)= npi=1 q(zi)e(zzi) . (2.13) second, observe contributions partition function |q(zi)| 2 suppressed relatively congurations q(zi) = 1 ; therefore restrict sum q(zi) values subsequently. third, corresponding term b2 action (2.12) problematic even restricted congurations: near monopole current situated z eld b(x) behaves like |x z|3 (in 5 = 4), consequently continuum integral r d4xb2 whereas lattice left ambiguity form factor would diverge quadratically, = e const. e2 (2.14) per centre nonvanishing monopole current. taking n powers account thus rewrite sum eq(z) eq(z)yz bd1 (h(z) eq(z)) x xn =0 yz 1 n! n xz1...zn xq(zi)=1bd1 h(z) nxi=1 q(zi)e(z zi)! . (2.15) let us x z, n lorentz index investigate, cases sums zi q(zi) give nonvanishing contribution monopole current density eq(z) = nxi=1 q(zi) e(z zi) (2.16) argument kronecker symbol bd1(h(z) eq(z)). let us assume lattice v sites. then, sum variable zi associated monopole (2v 2) cases contribution eq(z) current q(zi) = 1 gives 2v terms. vanishes, since zi diers z e(z zi) zero. two remaining cases give contributions eq = 1 eq. turning sums n variables zi associated monopole currents q(zi) = 1 decompose result powers (2v 2): (2v 2)n cases, zi coincides z, eq vanishes. 2n(2v 2)n 1 cases, one zi coincides z; 2n(2v 2)n 1 cases decomposed n(2v 2)n 1 cases eq = +1 n(2v 2)n 1 cases eq = 1. next 1 2 (2n) (2n 2) (2v 2)n 2 cases two zi coincide z; quarter corresponds eq = +2, half eq = 0 (since eq(zi) = eq(zj) zi = zj = z), remaining quarter eq = 2. m(cid:17)(2v 2)n 2m cases variables zi coincide z. general (cid:16)n corresponding contributions eq generally dierent; distinguish contributions eq write dierent cases !(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)eq=2m m!(2v 2)n m" mx=0 n (2.17) 6 expression squared brackets gives 2m terms. summing thus rewrite expression (2.15) yz xn = 1 n! n nxm=0 n m!(2v 2)n mx=0 !bd1 (h(z) 2 + m) . (2.18) sums rearranged partially evaluated; intermediate result one obtains e(2v 2) yz n+ 1 x=0 xn=0 n!! bd1 (h(z) + n) . (2.19) employing kronecker symbol order perform either sums n one ends standard series representation modied bessel function  and, omitting eld independent prefactor exp (2v 2), result becomes simply ih(z) (2) = epz, yz, log ih (z)(2) (2.20) restored summation lorentz index . result obtained previously diamantini, quevedo tru- genberger  help exact duality transformation partition function massive dual gauge eld. noted , semiclassical approximation h , , h/ xed exponent (2.20) becomes  + 42! sp (h) xz h arcsinh h 2! +qh 2 (2.21) whereupon one recovers euclidean four-dimensional version polyakovs action sp (h) . result summation monopole congurations hand position rewrite partition function (2.12). convenience switch continuum notation, rescale elds kinetic terms properly normalized: e1 + o(h 4), 0 inverse lattice spacing. obtain 0 a, b 21 0 b 4 0sp (h) = 1 2h 2 z =z dadb(a)d1(b) er d4x{ 1 4 (f mb )2+sp (h)} mass kalb-ramond eld b given m2 = 82 e2 2 0 . 7 (2.22) (2.23) weak eld limit sp (h), action (2.22) coincides 4d version action proposed quevedo trugenberger  describe condensation topological defects. two options concerning subsequent treatment partition function (2.22): rst option consists eld redenition b b + 1 f . (2.24) since h invariant redenition b bianci identity, gauge eld disappears completely action appears functions (a)d1(b + 1 mf). since number functions matches precisely number degrees freedom a, path integral performed giving trivial (eld independent) determinants. resulting partition function reads z (1) =z db er d4x{ 1 4 m2b2 +sp (h)} , (2.25) version derived polyakov . second way treat partition function (2.22) consists standard procedure promote functions gauge xing terms action: first, replace functions (a c) d1 (b c) (2.26) c, c arbitrary functions c = 0. next, integrate functions gaussian measure involving arbitrary gauge xing parameters ; resulting partition functions reads (again eld independent fadeev-popov determinants) z (2) =z dadb esinv sgf sinv =z d4x(cid:26)1 sgf =z d4x( 1 4 2 (f mb)2 + sp (h)(cid:27) , (b)2) .

(3.17) 12 thus functional equation equivalent statement 0 satises ward identity (2.30). 0,a = 0 (3.18) next consider variation k,a respect infrared cuto k. one evaluates kk,a eq.(3.16), derivative k hits gk ir cuto function rk. using erge (3.15) kgk one obtains following k,a important result: kk,a = 0 k,a = 0 . (3.19) hence functional equation k,a = 0 either terms gk terms k constitutes quasi-xed point erges. satised gk k k, also satised g0 0, i.e. 0 satisfy ward identity (2.30). let us dene abelian projection 0 0 0 = 0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)i=0 , (3.20) denote charged elds ai , ci, ci respect u(1) subgroups, cf. convention indices eq.
