abstract: following work on theories with su(n) gauge groups, we perform a large-n sad-
dle-point approximation of the measure for adhm multi-instantons in n = 4 supersymmetric
gauge theories with symplectic or orthogonal gauge groups. for sp(n) we nd that a sad-
dle-point only exists in the even instanton charge sector. for either sp(n) or so(n) the sad-
dle-point solution parametrizes ads5  rp 5, the dual supergravity geometry in the ads/cft
correspondence for these theories. the instanton measure at large-n has the form of the par-
tition function of ten-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory with a unitary gauge
group dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions.

1. introduction

this paper is concerned with the remarkable series of conjectures that have been made postu-
lating a duality in the t hooft coupling of conformally invariant gauge theories and type iib
string theory on a background of the form ads5  m5, where m5 is a certain ve dimensional
compact space. in the simplest casethe original conjecture of maldacena [1]the gauge the-
ory has n = 4 supersymmetry with su(n) gauge group in which case m5 is s5 (see also [24]).
when the gauge group is one of the other classical groups, the ve sphere is replaced by the
projective space s5/z2  rp 5 [5, 6]. there are many other generalizations; however, in this
paper we concentrate on the n = 4 theories with gauge groups sp(n) and so(n). in this
sense this is a companion to [7] which considered the su(n) theories.

refs. [7, 8] uncovered striking relations between the multi-instantons of n = 4 supersym-
metric gauge theory and d-instantons in type iib supergravity building on the ideas of [9, 10].
the rst relation involves the theory at nite n and the second at large-n:

(i) at nite n, we showed that the measure for adhm instantons was precisely equal to
the partition function of d-instantons moving in a background of n coincident d3-branes in
the decoupling limit   0. this partition function is precisely the dimensional reduction to
zero dimensions of the pure n = (1, 1) supersymmetric u(k) gauge theory in six dimensions
with n additional hypermultiplets (and so the resulting theory actually only has n = (1, 0)
supersymmetry). what is particularly striking is that the auxiliary scalars  introduced in [7]
to bi-linearize a certain four-fermion interaction in the instanton action arises in a very natural
way as the scalars corresponding to the six-dimensional gauge eld and describe the freedom
for the d-instantons to be ejected from the d3-branes.

(ii) at large n, the adhm measure can be approximated by an expansion around a saddle-
point and is proportional to the partition function of the six-dimensional pure n = (1, 1)
supersymmetric u(k) gauge theorywith no additional matterdimensionally reduced to zero
dimensions. alternatively, this can be described as the ten dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric
u(k) gauge theory dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions. this is precisely what one expects
for d-instantons in a at background with no d3 branes present where the u(1)k  u(k)
components of the gauge eld are interpreted as the position of the charge-k d-instanton in
r10. the only dierence with the large-n measure is that the abelian component of the gauge
eld is now interpreted as the position in ads5  s5: the near horizon geometry of the n  
d3-branes.

the large-n approximation of the measure described in (ii) was performed by a steepest-
decent method. this gives a way to probe the ten-dimensional geometry directly since the
solution of the saddle-point equations could be interpreted as the position of a point-like object
in ads5  s5. from the gauge theory side the solution represents the simple conguration

1

where all the instantons are at the same point in r4 with the same scale size and in mutually
commuting su(2) subgroups of the gauge group. the other ve coordinates arise from auxiliary
scalar variables that are used to bi-linearize a certain four-fermion interaction mediated by the
yukawa couplings in the gauge theory. these additional variables are so(6), the r-symmetry
of the n = 4 theory, vector-valued and at the saddle-point they are constrained to lie on s5.
this qualitative relation between large-n adhm instantons and d-instantons in ads5s5
was made quantitative since d-instantons contribute terms to the type iib eective [911] action
that imply very particular adhm instanton contributions to certain correlation functions.
in ref. [7] we found precise agreement between the d-instanton induced eects and adhm
contributions to the relevant correlation functions. this paper investigates the extent to which
this relation between d-instantons and adhm instantons persists when the gauge group of
the theory is either so(n) or sp(n). other generalizations involving n < 4 supersymmetric
theories either based on orbifolds of the su(n) theory or the nite n = 2 sp(n) theory have
been considered in refs. [12, 13]. we will not consider the nite-n relation spelled out in (i)
above; rather we shall concentrate on the large-n situation. our results are as follows:

(i) for gauge group sp(n) the adhm construction at charge k involves an auxiliary group
o(k). in this case the large-n saddle-point equations only have a solution for even instanton
number. the saddle-point solution in the instanton charge 2k sector describes the positions
of k point-like objects, the d-instantons of the string theory, in ads5  rp 5. the expansion
around the general saddle-point solution can be captured by an expansion around the maximally
degenerate solution where all the d-instantons are at the same point in ads5  rp 5. this
solution is invariant under u(k)  o(2k).

(ii) for gauge group so(n) the adhm construction at charge k involves an auxiliary group
sp(k). in this case the large-n saddle-point equations have a solution for all instanton numbers
k which describes the positions of k point-like objects, the d-instantons of the string theory,
in ads5  rp 5. in this case the maximally degenerate saddle-point solution is invariant under
u(k)  sp(k).

in both cases (i) and (ii) the large-n adhm instanton measure has the same form as
that of the instanton charge k sector of the n = 4 su(n) theory. in other words at leading
order the measure is equal to the partition function of ten-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric
u(k) dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions (the unbroken residual symmetry group in both
cases). the abelian components correspond to the overall position of the conguration in ads5
rp 5 along with the fermionic collective coordinates corresponding to the 16 supersymmetric
and superconformal fermion zero modes. the remaining non-abelian su(k) partition function

can then be explicitly computed to give a factor proportional to pd|k d2, a sum over over
the positive integer divisors d of k.
ng8k7/2 identical to the su(n) case.

in addition to this there is an overall numerical factor

2

these relations imply that instanton contribution at charge 2k and k, respectively, to
various correlation function in the sp(n) and so(n) theories match precisely the charge k
instanton contributions to the same correlators in the su(n) theory.

2. the adhm formalism for the classical groups

the adhm formalism [14] for constructing instanton solutions was adapted for dealing with
arbitrary classical gauge groups in the early instanton literature. the method adopted was
to consider the construction for one of the series of classical groups, e.g. symplectic groups in
ref. [15] and orthogonal groups in ref. [16], and then embed the other two series in this series.
our approach will be no dierent, although we will start from the unitary series. this has
the advantage of avoiding the language of quaterions but naturally our construction will be
equivalent to those in the previously mentioned references.

after briey reviewing the adhm formalism an n = 4 gauge theory with gauge group
su(n), we will then show how the orthogonal and symplectic cases may be embedded therein.
full details of the su(n) can be found in [7, 17].

the instanton solution at charge k, is described by an (n + 2k)  2k dimensional matrix

a, and its conjugate a, with the form

a =(cid:18) w 

 (cid:19) ,

a

a =(cid:0) w  a (cid:1) .

(2.1)

here w  is a (spacetime) weyl-spinor-valued n  k matrix and a
(spacetime) vector-valued k  k matrix. the conjugates are dened as

  = a

  where a

n is a

n are restricted to be hermitian: (a

the matrices a
n. the remaining 4k(n + k) variables
are still an over-parametrization of the instanton moduli space which is obtained by a hyper-
kahler quotient construction. one rst imposes the adhm constraints:

d 

  w w  + a a

  =  

 ,

(2.3)

where  is an arbitrary constant matrix. the adhm moduli space is then identied with the
space of as subject to (2.3) modulo the action of an u(k) symmetry which acts on the instanton
indices of the variables as follows

w   w u ,

   u a
a

 u , u  u(k).

(2.4)

the nal piece of the story is the explicit construction of the self-dual gauge eld itself. to

this end we dene the matrix

(x) =(cid:18)

w 

x 1[k][k] + a

 (cid:19) ,

(2.5)

where x , or equivalently xn, related via x  = xnn
the (n + 2k)  n dimensional complex-valued matrix u(x) is a basis for ker( ):

 , is a point in spacetime. for generic x,

u = 0 = u  ,

where u is orthonormalized according to

the self-dual gauge eld is then simply

uu = 1[n][n] .

vn = u nu .

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

the fermions in the background of the instanton lead to new grassmann collective coor-
dinates. associated to the fermions in the adjoint and anti-symmetric tensor representations,
a, these collective coordinates are described by the (n + 2k)  k matrices ma, and their
conjugates1

ma =(cid:18) a
(cid:19) ,
ma
where a are n  k matrices and ma
 are weyl-spinor-valued k  k matrices. the conjugates
are dened by

ma =(cid:0)a ma(cid:1) ,

(2.9)

and the constraint ma
to analogues of the adhm constraints (2.3):

 = ma

a  (a) ,
 is imposed. these fermionic collective coordinates are subject

 ) ,

  w a + aw  + [ma, a

 ] = 0 .

(2.11)

after this brief description of the su(n) adhm formalism we now turn to the other
classical groups sp(n) and so(n).2 in order to construct instanton solutions for gauge theories
with these groups we can use the embeddings

sp(n)  su(2n) ,

so(n)  su(n) ,

(2.12)

to extract the adhm formalism for these groups in terms of the su(n) adhm construction.
the surprising feature of the resulting formalisms is that the auxiliary group, u(k), in the
su(n) case and denoted generally as h(k), at instanton number k, in the general case is not in
the same classical series as the gauge group g. table 1 shows the auxiliary groups and denes
the quantities n  and k which allow us to present a unied treatment of sp(n) and so(n).

table 1: gauge and associated auxiliary groups

to describe the other classical groups we start with the theory with gauge group su(n )
at instanton instanton number k. instanton solutions in the sp(n) and so(n) theories follow
by simply imposing certain reality conditions on the adhm construction of the su(n ) theory
which ensures that the gauge eld lies in the correct sp(n) and so(n) subalgebra of su(n ). in
order to deal with both the sp(n) and so(n) case at the same time it is useful to dene the
notion of a generalized transpose operation denoted t which acts either on gauge or instanton
indices. specically, on sp(n) group indices t acts as as a symplectic transpose, i.e. on a column
vector v, vt = vt j t , where j is 2n  2n the symplectic matrix

1 0(cid:19) ;
j =(cid:18) 0 1

(2.13)

while on o(n) group indices t is a conventional transpose t  t . the adjoint representations of
both groups are hermitian t-anti-symmetric matrices with dimensions n(2n+ 1) and n(n1)/2,
respectively. hermitian t-symmetric matrices correspond to the anti-symmetric representation
of sp(n), with dimension n(2n1) and the symmetric representation of so(n), with dimensions
n(n + 1)/2. for the symplectic groups t-(anti-)symmetric matrices are conventionally called
(anti-)self-dual [18].

the reality conditions on the bosonic collective coordinates can then be written compactly

as

(a

 )t = a

w  =   (w )t ,

  ,

(2.14)
these reality conditions are only preserved by the subgroup h(k)  u(k) of the auxiliary
symmetry group. given (2.2) and (2.14), one can see that the matrices a
n are hermitian
and t-symmetric, i.e. real symmetric in the case of auxiliary group o(k), and symplectic anti-
symmetric in the case of auxiliary group sp(k). it is easy to verify that the adhm constraints
(2.3) themselves are anti-hermitian t-anti-symmetric, in other words h(k) adjoint-valued. it is
straightforward to show that these reality conditions are precisely what is required to render
the gauge eld t-anti-symmetric, in other words to restrict it to an sp(n) and so(n) subalgebra
of su(n ).

the fermionic collective coordinates are subject to a similar set of reality conditions:

a = (a)t ,

(ma

 )t = ma
 .

(2.15)

5

 is t-symmetric. the fermionic adhm constraints (2.11) are, like their bosonic coun-

so ma
terparts t-anti-symmetric.3

we can now count the number of real physical bosonic and fermionic collective coordinates.
for both sp(n) and so(n) at instanton number k there are 4kn independent w variables,
taking into account the reality conditions. the number of a
n variables is 4  k(k + 1)/2 and
4 k(2k  1), for sp(n) and so(n), respectively. the physical moduli space is then the space
of these variables modulo the three h(k)-valued adhm constraints (2.3) and auxiliary h(k)
symmetry. hence the dimension of the physical moduli space is 4k(n + 1) and 4k(n  2), for
sp(n) and so(n), respectively. this agrees with the counting via the index theorem. the
counting of the fermionic sector of the physical moduli space goes as follows. for each a, there
are 2kn real degrees-of-freedom in a and 2 k(k + 1)/2 and 2 k(2k  1), in ma
 , for sp(n)
and so(n), respectively. the adhm constraints then impose 2 k(k  1)/2 and 2 k(2k + 1)
conditions, for sp(n) and so(n), respectively. hence there are 2k(n + 1) and 2k(n  2) real
physical fermionic collective coordinates for sp(n) and so(n), respectively, for each a. again
this agrees with the counting via the index theorem.

3. the multi-instanton collective coordinate measure

in this section we write down the measure on the space of adhm collective coordinates and
then show how, for n large enough, both the bosonic and fermionic adhm constraints can be
explicitly resolved. this leads to a gauge invariant form for the measure which is then amenable
to a large-n limit.

3.1 the adhm multi-instanton at measure

in order to calculate physical quantities we need to know how to integrate on the space of
adhm variables. this is the measure induced from the full functional integral of the eld
theory. thankfully, it turns out the measure is remarkably simple when written in terms of the
adhm variables: it is just the at measure for all the variables with the adhm constraints
imposed via explicit delta functions [7,19,20]. in order to dene the physical measure, we must
divide by the volume of the auxiliary group h(k):

ak (c 

1 )k

z dk

phys =

vol h(k)z da dw ya=1,2,3,4
(cid:0)( c)

 yc=1,2,3

(cid:1) yb=2,3,4
(cid:0)a

(3.1)

(cid:0)l  a1b  1b(cid:1) .

3in proving this it is useful to notice that (wt

)t = w  and ((a)t)t = a.

6

the form of the measure is an obvious generalization of the su(n) measure [7,20] to the other
groups. the following points are worthy of mention:

(i) the integrals over the t-symmetric hermitian matrices a

 are dened as the
integrals over the components with respect to a basis rr of hermitian t-symmetric matrices,
normalized so that trk rrrs = rs.

n and ma

(ii) the delta functions for the adhm constraints and the integrals over the pseudo collec-
tive coordinates aab are dened with respect to a basis of t-anti-symmetric hermitian matrices,
i.e. the lie algebra of h(k), normalized so that trk t rt s = rs.

(iii) the constant factor ak is xed by clustering decomposition as discussed in the ap-

pendix. up to a factor of ck, which can absorbed into (c 

1 )k, we prove

ak =(2k2/4 sp(n) ,

so(n) .

22k2

(3.2)

(iv) the factor involving the kth power of the constant c 

1 is not xed by clustering. it
can be xed by a comparison with the explicit one instanton measure that can be deduced in
a similar way to that of the one instanton su(n) measure in [21] to yield

c 

23(cid:1)2(n +1)
1 = (a1)1 ((cid:0) g2
23(cid:1)2(n 2)
(cid:0) g2

sp(n)

so(n) .

(3.3)

(v) the pseudo collective coordinates aab are t-anti-symmetric, or h(k) lie algebra-valued,
matrices associated to the scalar elds of the theory. the operator l is a linear operator on
the lie algebra of h(k) with a positive spectrum, dened by

l   =

1
2{, w 0} + [a

n, [a

n, ]] .

the integrals over the aab can be done explicitly to yield

z yb=2,3,4

da1b yb=2,3,4

(cid:0)l  a1b  1b(cid:1) =(cid:0)det l(cid:1)3

.

(3.4)

(3.5)

however, the un-integrated form (3.1) makes the supersymmetry more manifest [20].

3.2 the multi-instanton action

the action for the theory evaluated on the instanton solution at leading order has the form

sk

inst =

82k
g2  ik + sk

quad .

(3.6)

7

as in [7], the four-fermion interaction can be bi-linearized by introducing an so(6) r-
symmetry vector of hermitian t-anti-symmetric matrices a (i.e. h(k) adjoint-valued), a =
1, . . . , 6. we can re-write a as an anti-symmetric tensor by introducing the clebsch-gordon
coecients a

ab (see [7] for denitions):

ab =

1

a

aba .

the identity we need is5

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

quad is a particular fermion quadrilinear term, with one fermion collective coordinate

here sk
chosen from each of the four gaugino sectors a = 1, 2, 3, 4 [7]:

sk

quad =

g2 abcd trk abacd =

g2 abcd trk abl1cd .

here

ab =

22 (cid:0) mamb  mbma(cid:1) .

it is straightforward to show that ab is h(k) adjoint-valued, i.e. t-anti-symmetric.4

quad(cid:1) = 3k(k1)z d exp(cid:2)  trk ala + 4ig1trk abab(cid:3) .

(det l)3 exp(cid:0)sk
here, the integral is dened with respect to the t-anti-symmetric basis: a = r
this bi-linearization absorbs the (det l)3 factor from the aab integrals (3.5).

at r. notice that

3.3 the gauge invariant measure

it is convenient to change variables to a gauge invariant set. since we will be integrating gauge
invariant quantities, the integral over gauge transformation yields a volume factor. the gauge
invariant variables are encoded in the 2k  2k matrix w :

w 

 = w w  .

associated to this are four k  k hermitian matrices dened via

w 0 = tr2 w, w c = tr2  cw, c = 1, 2, 3 .

(3.11)

(3.12)

4in order to show that ab is t-anti-symmetric, it is important to bear in mind that t just acts on gauge
and instanton indices. hence on a product of grassmann quantities, say a and b, there is an extra minus sign
under t-conjugation: (ab)t = btat.
to gauge group so(n ).

5in this and subsequent equations the upper signs will correspond to gauge group sp(n ) and the lower signs

8

using the reality conditions (2.14) one nds that in addition to being hermitian

the bosonic adhm (2.3) constraints are then linear in w c:

(w 0)t = w 0 ,

(w c)t = w c .

0 = w c + i[a

n, a

m]tr2  cnm = w c  i[a

n, a

m]c

nm ,

(3.13)

(3.14)

where c

nm is a t hooft eta-symbol [7].

when n   2k, we can change variables from the ws to the w s yielding a jacobian as

well as a numerical factor that reects the volume of the gauge group action:

z gauge

coset

dw = ck,nz (det2kw )n /2k2/21/4 dw 0 yc=1,2,3

dw c .

(3.15)

we will only need the numerical pre-factor in the large n limit which can be evaluated by
integrating both sides of (3.15) again a suitable exponential test function to give

ck,n =

n

22k2k

(n /)2kn +k2k/2e2kn .

(3.16)

this change of variables brings with it a signicant advantage: we can integrate out the w c
variables using the delta functions in (3.1) since the latter are linear in the former.

on the fermionic side we need to integrate out the superpartners of the gauge degrees-of-

freedom. to isolate these variables we expand

a = w  a + w  a + a ,

(3.17)

where the a modesthe ones we need to integrate outare in the subspace orthogonal to
the ws, i.e. w a = 0, and the variables  a and  a are t-symmetric and t-anti-symmetric
k  k matrices, respectively. notice that the a modes do not appear in the fermionic adhm
constraints (2.11). the change of variables from a to { a, a, a} involves a jacobian:

z ya=1,2,3,4

da =z (det2kw )2k ya=1,2,3,4

d a da da .

(3.18)

we can now integrate out the a variables:

z ya=1,2,3,4

da exp(cid:2)8ig1trk ab(a)tb(cid:3) = 26kn 6k2

(/g)4kn 4k2

(det4k)n /2k

.

(3.19)

furthermore, the fermionic adhm constraints can then be used to integrate out the t-anti-
symmetric variables  a, however the result is rather cumbersome to write down and is in any
case is not needed at this stage. fortunately in the large-n limit to be described shortly it
simplies considerably.

4. the measure in the large-n limit

the gauge invariant form of the measure is now amenable to a large n limit. as in [7], we
write terms which have the form of something to the power n as exp(n se/2), for some
eective large-n action se, and then perform a saddle-point approximation by minimizing
the action with respect to the variables. in order to achieve this, we have to re-scale the 
variables:

the eective action has three contributions

a pn /2 a.

up to constant which we keep track of separately.

se =  log det2k w  log det4k  + trk ala ,

(4.1)

(4.2)

the resulting saddle-point equations are identical to those in [7] for the su(n) case:

abcd (lab) ce = 1
aa = 1

e 1[k][k] ,

2d
2(w 1)0 ,
nm[a

[a, [a, a

n]] = ic

m, (w 1)c] .

(4.3a)

(4.3b)

(4.3c)

using the su(n) case [7] as a guide, we can write down the solutions to these equations.
as in the n = 4 case we look for a solution with w c = 0, c = 1, 2, 3, which means that the
instantons are embedded in mutually commuting su(2) subgroups of the gauge group. in this
case equations (4.3c) are equivalent to

[a

n, a

m] = [a

n, a] = [a, b] = 0 , w 0 = 1

2(aa)1 .

(4.4)

the nal equation can be viewed as giving the value of w 0, whose eigenvalues are the instanton
sizes at the saddle-point. clearly aa and w 0 must be non-degenerate.

for sp(n) it is easy to see that a well-dened solution only exists for k even. the point is
that the set of commuting anti-symmetric matrices a of odd dimension have a common null
eigenvector and so aa has no inverse contrary to hypothesis.6 from now on, for sp(n) we
shift k  2k and so k = k for both sp(n) and so(n) and we will replace k with k. the
general solution with instanton number 2k, up to action of the auxiliary o(2k) symmetry, is in
block form

a

w 0 = diag(cid:0)21, . . . , 2k(cid:1)  1[2][2] ,

6for k odd one of the eigenvalues of w 0 has to be innite and although the action is formally nite the

more detail.

in principle, we have to expand the eective action around the general solutions written
down in the last section to sucient order to ensure that the uctuation integrals converge.
in general because the gaussian form has zeroes whenever two d-instantons coincide one has
to go to quartic order in the uctuations. fortunately, as explained in [7], we do not need to
expand about the most general solution to the saddle-point equations to quartic order since
this is equivalent to expanding to the same order around the most degenerate solution where
all the d-instantons are at the same point in ads5  rp 5. the resulting quartic action has
at directions corresponding to the relative positions of the d-instantons. however, when the
fermionic integrals are taken into account the integrals over these relative positions turn out
to be convergent and hence these degrees-of-freedom should be viewed as uctuations around
rather than facets of the maximally degenerate solution. the variables left un-integrated, since
they are not convergent, can be viewed as centre-of-mass coordinates.

the maximally degenerate solution for both cases can be written as

w 0 = 22 1[2k][2k] ,

a = 1 a s ,

a
n = xn 1[2k][2k] ,

where

s = 1[k][k] ( 2 sp(n) ,

 3 so(n) .

the parameters {, xn, a} will be identied with centre-of-mass coordinates. this solution
is left invariant by a subgroup of u(k)  h(k) consisting of transformations that x s. for
sp(n) it is generated by the elements

re(a[k][k])   2

and i im(a[k][k])  1[2][2]

and for so(n) by elements

in both (4.11) and (4.12) a is a hermitian k  k matrix.

a[k][k]   3 .

(4.11)

(4.12)

to construct the nal form of the measure at large n, we have to expand the eective action
around the maximally degenerate solution to sucient order to ensure that the uctuation
integrals are convergent. as in the su(n) case [7], some variables need only to be expanded to
gaussian order whilst for the remainder, we must go to quartic order. although many details
are identical to the su(n) case in ref. [7] there are dierences which we explain below:

(i) as in [7], we separate out the non-convergent integrals over the centre-of-mass coordi-
nates (, xn, a) and expand the adhm variables around the maximally degenerate saddle-
point solution as

a
n = xn1[2k][2k] + a
n ,
w 0 = 221[2k][2k] + w 0 ,
a = 1 as + a ,

(4.13a)

(4.13b)

(4.13c)

it is useful to employ the further decomposition

a

n = a

n + a

n ,

a = a + a ,

(4.14)

where a
and a

n and a are the uctuations which do not commute with s (in fact they anti-commute)

n and a are the remainder that do commute with s.

similarly, we separate out the integrals over the 16 supersymmetric and super-conformal
 and  a, respectively, that are not lifted by the quadrilinear term (3.7), and

zero-modes a
expand the fermionic variables in a similar way to the bosonic variables:

 = 4a

 + ma
ma
 ,
 a = 4 a1[2k][2k] +  a +  a ,

 1[2k][2k] + ma

(4.15a)

(4.15b)

where we have introduced the same decomposition for the fermions as for the bosons in
eq. (4.14).

(ii) the expansion of the log det8k term in the saddle-point action can be read-o from
the su(n) expression [7] with the following observation. in the present situation  is being

12

expanded around s, rather than the identity in the u(n) case, but since s2 = 1 we can write

a = 1 as + a = s(1 a1[2k][2k] + sa) .

(4.16)

moreover det8k = det8k(s) and so we can use our previous su(n) formulae for expanding
det8k with the replacement a  sa.

(iii) the expansion of the eective action to gaussian order around the saddle-point solution

is

s(2) = 

1
2 tr2k [s, a

n]2  2tr2k [s, 

a ]2 + tr2k(cid:0)(22)1w 0 + {s, aa}(cid:1)2

.

(4.17)

in the above 
uctuations in terms of the decompositions (4.14), this becomes

a is the component of a orthogonal to the unit vector a. writing the

s(2) =

where

4
2 tr2k (a

n)2 + 42tr2k ( 

a )2 + tr2k 2,

(4.18)

 = 2{s, aa} +

1
22 w 0.
notice that the gaussian terms lift all the uctuations w 0, a
n and a except the component
of a along a, which we denote k
a. in fact this variation corresponds precisely to the action of
innitesimal h(k) transformations on the maximally degenerate solution (4.9) although notice
that as stated above the subgroup u(k) leaves the solution invariant. the observation is that
any uctuation k
a can be written as a[s, ] for some   h(k) (the lie algebra of h(k)) and
conversely, innitesimal h(k) transformations generate all such k
a. we can gauge-x this
symmetry by the condition k
a = 0 which results in a jacobian factor that involves the volume
of the coset h(k)/u(k).

(4.19)

since tr2k(xyz) = 0, for three matrix quantities x, y and z with the decomposition (4.14),
at leading order in 1/n the variables a
n and a are completely decoupled from the other uc-
tuations and we can proceed to integrate them. taking into account the gauge-xing jacobian
we have

z da

n d a exp(cid:0)  2n tr2k [2(a

n)2 + 2( 

a )2](cid:1) = 29k2/2k/2(a

k)1 vol h(k)

vol u(k)(cid:16) n 

 (cid:17)5k2

.

(4.20)

here the constant a
for so(n).

k is related to one dened in (3.2) with a

k = a2k, for sp(n), and a

k = ak,

(iv) the situations for the fermions is very similar. first of all we fulll our promise to

deal with the fermionic adhm constraints. to leading order in 1/n, these constraints read

22a

 =  1

2 [w 0,  a

 ]  [ma, a

 ] .

(4.21)

13

so the integrals over the  a variables soak up the delta-functions imposing the fermionic
adhm constraints, as promised. in (4.21) w 0 are the uctuations in w 0 all of which are
lifted at gaussian order. due to a cross term we can eectively replace w 0 with 43   at
leading order (see [7]). collecting all the leading order terms, the fermion couplings are

sf = i(cid:16) 82n 

g2 (cid:17)1/2

 + 1 ab(cid:2)a

 ,ma(cid:3) b
 (cid:1)i .
 + mamb

+ ab(cid:0)2 a b

(4.22)

it is straightforward to see that the variables ma and  a couple directly to the saddle-point
solution and can be integrated-out directly:

z ya=1,2,3,4

= 2k22k(cid:16) n

 b](cid:1)

(4.23)

(v) the remaining variables on the bosonic side are , a

n and a. fortunately the action
for these variables, to leading order is exactly as in the su(n) case [7] with the replacement,
pointed out in (ii), a  s a. however, since all the hatted variables commute with s in the
nal expressions this replacement is equivalent to to leaving a unchanged and instead taking
n, ma  s ma and  a  s  a. this is more convenient because then all the
a
n  sa
n, a, s ma, s  a} are adjoint-valued in su(k)  h(k). the variables  can be
quantities {sa
integrated out at gaussian order, as is evident from (4.18), however as in [7] we have to take
account of a coupling between  and a bi-linear in the remaining variables a
n and a. thus
the  integral yields a quartic term in these variables which along with the quartic terms in
the expansions of the two determinant factors in (4.2) gives a remarkably simple nal result.
as in [7] the remaining uctuations can be assembled into a ten-dimensional su(k) gauge eld
with components

a = (n /4)1/4(cid:0)1sa

n,  a(cid:1),

(4.24)

and the quartic action for these variables is precisely action of ten-dimensional su(k) gauge
theory dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions:

nsb(a) = tr2k [a, a]2 .

(4.25)

(vi) not surprisingly the remaining fermionic variables fermions can be assembled into
a majorana-weyl fermion of the dimensionally reduced ten-dimensional theory with sixteen
components

 =r

(n /4)1/8(cid:0)1/2s ma

(4.26)

14

the coupling of these fermions to the gauge eld a completes the action (4.25) to that of
a ten-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric su(k) gauge theory dimensionally reduced to zero
dimensions:

s(a, ) = tr2k [a, a]2 + 2tr2k  [a, ] ,

(4.27)

where, in the way described in [7], the ten-dimensional gamma matrices  depend explicitly
on the unit vector a.

(4.29)

to emphasize the above result pertains to (i) sp(n) in the sector with even instanton charge
2k and (ii) so(n) in all the charge sectors with charge k. notice that the form of the large-n
measure is identical to that of of the charge k sector of the su(n) theory.

at leading order in 1/n where any operator insertions take their saddle-point values the
su(k) partition function zk is simply an overall constant factor that has been evaluated in
ref. [22]:9

(4.31)

to summarize, the large-n instanton measures for the charge 2k sector of the sp(n) theory
and the charge k sector of the so(n) theory, have an identical form to that for the charge-
k sector in the su(n) theory. so to leading order in 1/n, correlation functions will receive
identical instanton contributions from these sectors.

7in this result we have not kept track of factors of 2 of the form 2c1+c2k (c1 and c2 being constants) since
2c1 only aects the overall normalization of the answer and 2c2k can obviously be absorbed into a multiplicative
redenition of the modular parameter q = e2i ; henceforth such a redenition is understood.

8our normalization for the partition is dierent from that in [7].
9we have written the result in a way which allows an easy comparison with [22]. the factors of 2 and
2 arise, respectively, from the dierence in the denition of the bosonic integrals and the normalization of the
generators: we have trk t rt s = rs rather than 1

2 rs. the remaining factors are the result of [22].

appendix a: cluster decomposition

the clustering property of the k-instanton measure, namely the degeneration of the measure
into the k  1 and 1 instanton measures when one instanton is far separated from the others,
is crucial for determining the correct k dependent normalization in front of the measure (up
to the constant (c 
1 )k). the clustering property has been extensively discussed for the case of
gauge groups sp(1)  su(2) [19] and su(n) in [17], so our discussion will be brief.

we will consider the complete clustering limit which describes a region of the moduli space

where all the instantons are well separated from each other. in this limit, we require

intuitively, the complete clustering limit is the region of moduli space where the matrices
[a
m]  0 and where their eigenvalues, which specify the positions of the individual instantons
are suciently part apart. we shall discover exactly what suciently part apart actually
means as we proceed.

it is useful to use the auxiliary h(k) symmetry to simultaneously diagonalize the t-symmetric
matrices a
n matrices in the clustering limit. this amounts to gauge-xing the coset h(k)/h(1)k
of the auxiliary h(k) symmetry.10 the remaining h(1)k symmetry corresponds to the auxiliary
symmetry groups of the k individual instantons. the diagonal elements of x i
n)ii then
specify the positions of the instantons (with x i = x i+k for sp(k)). the gauge xing involves
a jacobian factor:

n = (a

2k(k+1)/2
u(k) ,
22k23k/2

sp(k) ,

(a.3)

10this gauge xing is a valid procedure because the measure is only used to integrate h(k) invariant functions.

the relation (a.2) can easily be derived from the well-known jacobian that arises from changing
variables for an integral over the elements of a (i) real symmetric (ii) hermitian or a (iii)
hermitian self-dual matrix a, for o(k), u(k) and sp(k), respectively (normalized with respect
to the basis rr), to its eigenvalues ai (see for example [18]):

(a.6)

the clustering limit is dened as the limit where the o-diagonal bosonic adhm constraints

can be approximated by

(x i  x j) (a

 )ij + ( w w )ij = ij 

 ,

(a.7)

for arbitrary ij, i.e. to order o(|x i  x j|2) they are approximately linear in the elements
(a
n )ij. in this limit, we can then easily integrate out these elements. similarly, in the clustering
limit, the o-diagonal fermionic adhm constraints are approximately linear in the elements
(m

)ij; to order o(|x i  x j|1)

(x i  x j) (m)ij + (w )ij + ( w )ij = 0 .

(a.8)

in the clustering limit, we can then easily integrate out the o-diagonal elements (m

)ij.

after integrating-out the o-diagonal components of the adhm constraints using (a.7) and
(a.8), the k independent diagonal components of the constraints are the adhm constraints
for the k individual instantons. taking careful account of numerical factors one nds that the
measure in (3.1) must include the factor ak, dened in (3.2) to cancel the factor of 2k2 in (a.2).
notice that the factor of 2k can be absorbed into the constant (c 

1 )k.
