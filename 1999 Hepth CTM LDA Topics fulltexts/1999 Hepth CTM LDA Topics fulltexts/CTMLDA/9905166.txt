(1.6) disconnectedness space c2 suggests solitons/antisolitons may hamper topological term (1.4) dened rmly. fact, pointed earlier  shown hopf term conventional form (1.4) well-dened vanishing soliton number sector. prime aim present paper examine closely hopf term (2 + 1)- dimensional nsm, thereby show procedure proposed  extend applicable domain term whole conguration space viable mathematically also natural physical point view. argument based primarily ad- joint orbit parameterization (aop) model one uses group (su (2)-)valued eld g instead vector eld n original description. aop intro- duced  describe nsm general framework g/h coset models, turns advantageous original description especially treating topological quantities, property crucial implementing procedure proposed. also present path-integral derivation soliton term (1.3) well-dened congurations (1 + 1)-dimensional nsm method similar used induce -term yang-mills theory (3 + 1) dimensions . highlight analogy two terms quantum mechanically induced topological term, time elucidate usefulness aop nsm. begin discussion reviewing hamiltonian formulation model (d + 1) dimensions using aop section 2. show section 3 (1 + 1)-dimensional nsm soliton term arises unitary representations fundamental group associated gauge symmetry inherent aop. section 4, hopf term (2 + 1)-dimensional nsm examined detail original description, section 5 re-examined aop present procedure extension physical interpretation. section 6 devoted conclusion discussions, including possibility hopf term topological wess-zumino term (1 + 1) dimensions. 2. hamiltonian formulation aop aop description nsm identifying target space eld n(x, t) nontrivial adjoint orbit lie group g. o(3) nsm, take g = su (2) 3 use {ta = a/2i; = 1, 2, 3} basis lie algebra su(2). su (2)-valued eld g(x, t) consider g t3 g1 = nata, (2.1) l.h.s. forms adjoint orbit passing t3, identied target s2 n(x, t) satisfying |n| = 1. note aop possesses inherent ambiguity associated subgroup u (1) su (2) generated element t3. indeed, n(x, t) unchanged transformations g(x, t) g(x, t) h(x, t), (2.2) (smooth) function h(x, t) u (1). account ambiguity, boundary condition g(x, t) corresponds (1.2) n(x, t) becomes g(x, t) g0 k(x, t) |x| , (2.3) g0 su (2) constant element fullling g0 t3 g1 0ta k(x, t) u (1) arbitrary function dened spatial innity. boundary condition (2.3) implies that, xed time, unlike n regarded map sd s2, map g used aop treated map d-dimensional disc group, dd su (2), dd sd1 identied spatial innity. aop original lagrangian (1.1) becomes3 0 = na l0(g) = 1 22 tr (g1g|r)2. (2.4) lagrangian (2.4) (trivial) local u (1) symmetry (2.2) due ambiguity aop mentioned above. order construct hamiltonian formulation nsm (d + 1)-dimensional spacetime, adopt diracs procedure constrained systems introduce set su (2) variables a(x), = 1, 2, 3, parametrize g(x) = g(a(x)). conjugate momenta = l(g)/ matrix n b b = (cid:26) 1 b, is, (n 1)a (n 1)a c. point noted j(x) = j a(x)ta independent parameterization and, together btb := g1(g/a), dene b inverse n c, = 1, 2, b n b c = n b (n 1)b j = (n 1)a c = 2 n c 0, = 3, (2.5) 3 conventions: trace normalized tr tatb = ab, symbol |r denotes x|r = a=1 x ata. antisymmetric tensor sign 01 = 1, use p2 a=1 x ata x = p3 u := u/t u := u/x (for = 1). 4 g(x), parametrizes phase space model, forming following fundamental poisson bracket, { j a(x) , j b(y) } = abc j c(x) (d)(x y), { j a(x) , g(y) } = g(x) ta (d)(x y), { g(x) , g(y) } = 0. (2.6) legendre transform lagrangian (2.4) leads hamiltonian h0(g, j) = r ddx h0 h0(g, j) = 2 2 tr(j|r)2 + 1 22 tr (g1ig|r)2. note primary constraint (in diracs notation), (g, j) 0, (g, j) := j 3(x), (2.7) (2.8) generates innitesimal right transformation associated gauge transformation (2.2). since constraint (2.8) commutes hamiltonian (2.7) poisson bracket (2.6), (secondary) constraints arise. 3. soliton term specialize (1 + 1)-dimensional case show soliton term (1.3) arises result quantization. end, rst observe = 1 spatial innity consists two points x = always eliminate arbitrary function k(x, t) (2.3) gauge transformation (2.2). thus, instead (2.3) may consider simplied boundary condition, g(x, t) g0 |x| , without loss generality. condition, xed time function h(x, t) (2.2) becomes map (eective) space s1 target u (1) s1. thus, gauge transformations classied winding number, w(h) = 1 4 zs 1 dx tr t3(h1h) (3.1) map, representative map possessing winding number n zz given hn(x; l) := e4nxt3/l, l length space s1. gauge transformations zero winding number generated innitesimal transformations called small gauge transformations, whereas non-zero winding number called large gauge transformations. let us next see consequences invariance theory transformations quantum theory. 5 upon quantizing model schrodinger picture, state vectors represented wave functionals  argument g(x) denotes conguration xed time. observables phase space regarded self-adjoint operators (although use notation before) and, particular, canonical momenta conjugate a(x) realized functional derivatives a(x) = ih/a(x). gauge symmetry theory ensured requiring gauge transformations (2.2) physical functionals invariant phys = eif  phys, (3.2) phase eif given functional f . small gauge transformations (with eif = 1) follows condition implements rst class constraint (2.8) quantum theory, j 3(x) phys = (n 1)3 b b phys = 0, (3.3) analogue gauss law gauge theory. nd phase factor eif  acquired large gauge transformations, let us note map h(x) winding number w(h) = n decomposed h(x) = hn(x; l)h(x) using representative map hn(x; l) h(x) zero winding follows (3.3) factor eif  depends winding number. number h(x), given unitary representation additive group zz, namely, phys = eiw(h)phys, (3.4) arbitrary angle parameter  := eik phys. (3.6) noting j aeik = eik (j + h 4 3abtr tb(g1g )), see invariant states  obey schrodinger equation form h(g, j) = e , h(g, j) = r dx h modied hamiltonian h(g, j) = 2 2 (cid:18)j h 4 3abtr tbg1g (cid:19)2 + 1 22 tr (g1g |r)2. (3.7) 6 one put formulation quantum theory path-integral formalism means standard faddeev-popov prescription (see, e.g., ), one introduces gauge xing condition (g, j) 0 corresponding constraint (g, j) 0 (2.8) considers partition function phase space, z = z dg dj ()() | det{, }| exp(cid:20) h z d2x(cid:0)tr j(g1 g) h(cid:1)(cid:21) , (3.8) dg dj = qx,t. choosing gauge xing condition j- independent (g, j) = (g), noting {, } gives innitesimal gauge trans- formation , one carry j-integrations get conguration space path- integral, z = z dg () | det | exp(cid:20) h z d2x(cid:18)l0(g) h 8 tr t3(g1 g)(cid:19)(cid:21) . (3.9) rst term l0(g) exponent path-integral lagrangian (2.4), whereas second term soliton term lsoliton (1.3) readily conrmed upon also obvious path-integral measure dg () | det | must using (2.1). measure dn eld n(x, t). indeed, see explicitly employ euler angle decomposition4 g = et3 et2 et3 measure reads dg = q sin = ddn, whereby choose (g) = = const. therefore arrive z = z dn exp(cid:20) h z d2x(cid:18) 1 22 (n)2 + h 8 abcnanb nc(cid:19) (cid:21) , (3.10) shows soliton term (1.3) induced upon quantization o(3) nsm (1 + 1) dimensions. 4. hopf term n(x, t) hopf term (1.4) widely used physics literature especially context fractional spin statistics (2 + 1) dimensions. however, unlike soliton term (1 + 1) dimensions, hopf term well-dened mathematically generic congurations, hence requires careful consideration used. examine problem detail, rst recall hopf invariant used mathematics (see, e.g., ). let f map s3 s2 f generator de rham cohomology h 2 dr(s2) = ri . 4 since decomposition possible locally su(2), rigorous treatment one needs introduce set patches cover su(2). obstruction nave global gauge xing also evident terms g soliton term total divergence terms n not. 7 since h 2 dr(s3) = 0 pullback f f f map f (i.e., f regarded 2-form s3) admits form f f = da 1-form s3. hopf invariant associated map f given h(f ) := 1 162 zs 3 da , (4.1) normalization chosen h(f ) zz f normalized rs 2 f 4zz. note topological invariant h(f ) (4.1) independent words, despite exists ambiguity (under u (1) choice a. gauge transformations d) hence integrand (4.1), integral still uniquely determined. appropriately normalized f hopf invariant h(f ) becomes integer characterizing map f . evidently, vector eld n regarded map s3 s2 s3 (eective) spacetime, identifying n f also 1 2 f dx dx 2-form f f , integral hopf term (1.4) spacetime s3 becomes identical (4.1) overall constant and, therefore, well-dened. however, boundary condition space (1.2) implies shall considering nsm spacetime form = s2 time interval, say, = , = s2 s1 additional periodic boundary condition time imposed. thus general map given n : s2 , h 2 dr(m ) 6= 0. accordingly, guarantee nd (globally dened) satisfying nf = da given map n. words, nave integral, i(a; ) := 1 162 zm da, (4.2) cannot used providing topological term want. point one may think solution regard u (1) connection base space , is, nd given locally patches introduced trivialize bre bundle. work seen follows. suppose covered two local patches, m1 m2, 1-form a1 a2, respectively, satisfying nf = daa = 1, 2. one may consider, instead (4.2), sum integrals5 i(a1; m1) + i(a2; m2) i(a1; m1 m2). (4.3) 5 one also use a2 instead a1 last term, creates another ambiguity dening topological term. 8 is, however, invariant gauge transformations aa aa da performed separately patches 1 2 chosen independently, variation, 1da1 plus contributions two terms, vanish generic a. (the gauge noninvariance conventional hopf term pointed earlier .) rm1 actually, problem chern-simons term gauge theory (rather hopf term nsm), assumed connection globally dened , enough one interested perturbative analysis theory. real problem hopf term o(3) nsm assumption excludes solitons anti-solitons unless total charge vanishes, considered responsible physical phenomena interest fractional spin. indeed, spacetime = s2 (or = s2 s1) assumption amounts requirement 2-form nf trivial element h 2 dr(m ) and, therefore, nd soliton charge, q(n) := 1 4 zs 2 nf , (4.4) becomes q(n) = (1/4)rs 2 da = 0, is, map n must belong sector soliton charge vanishes. conversely, possible show restriction sector q(n) = 0 sucient topological term well-dened nsm. this, rst note that, generic spacetime , condition h 2 dr(m ) = 0 still enough ensuring integral (4.2) well-dened, gauge invariance integral (4.2) requires 1-form must general gauge-xed 6= 0. quantum theory, however, gauge xing necessary space time = s2 i. reason that, well-known, quantum theory always place periodic boundary conditions time,6 allows us put time period s1 thereby remove boundary spacetime. notice aforementioned restriction q(n) = 0 sector made nsm, deform map n(x) = 0 continuously constant map n(x) = n0 without changing integral (4.2) (since (s2 s1) = 0). procedure allows us regard n map s3 s2 shrinking space s2 point ends time and, consequently, 6 easily realized path-integral particle, one needs dene relative phase given pair paths, rather dene absolute phase path, order provide transition amplitude. relative phase pair two paths obeying boundary conditions = 0 regarded phase attached path given connecting two paths (with time one paths reversed). amounts dening phase arbitrary loop path possessing initial nal points. 9 integral (4.2), hopf invariant (4.1), used topological term model.7 5. hopf term g(x, t) foregoing argument shows basically three obstacles nave integral i(a; ) (4.2) well-dened topological term associated hopf invariant (4.1). obstacles related conditions term (i) well-dened integral spacetime , (ii) topological invariant, (iii) gauge invariant. shall see shortly, aop situation concerning conditions turns quite dierent, shall exploit order dene topological term congurations, fullling three conditions. end, rst note corresponding f becomes 2-form target map g : d2 su (2) s3, given f = trt3(g1dg)2. since dr(d2 i) = 0 always 1-form pullback f g becomes h 2 g f = da obvious solution = trt3(g1dg). thus local variable g contrast previous nonlocal n. accordingly, aop integral (4.2) turns local expression , i(a; ) = i(g) := 1 482 z tr(g1dg)3 , (5.1) = d2 i, shows condition (i) fullled. passing mention that, account boundary condition (2.3), aop version soliton charge (4.4) reads q(g) := 1 4 zd2 g f = 1 4 zd2 trt3(g1dg) , (5.2) gives winding number map k : d2 s1 u (1) space innity. let us observe that, spacetime g regarded d2 s1 done path-integral, integral (5.1) becomes topological invariant irrespective soliton sector in. indeed, arbitrary variation g g + g obtain i(g + g) i(g) = trg1g(g1dg)2 , (5.3) 1 162 z vanishes g assumed form (2.3) = d2 s1 hence (g1dg)2| = (k1dk)2| = 0. however, problem i(g) invariant 7 literature  term (4.2) considered even sectors nonzero soliton numbers coulomb gauge. however, pointed , fractional spin evaluated directly term becomes gauge dependent physically unacceptable. 10 time-dependent gauge transformations (2.2) possessing nontrivial winding numbers along s1. conrmed directly observing i(gh) i(g) = 1 162 z tr(k1dk) (dh h1) . (5.4) evaluate r.h.s. (5.4), let l length boundary d2 s1 regard domain integral = s1 s1 rectangle 2 =   periodic boundary conditions imposed maps k h. introducing coordinates (x, t) 2, put k(x, t) = e(x,t)t3 hm(x; l) hl(t; ) , h(x, t) = e(x,t)t3 hn(t; ) , (5.5) (x, t) (x, t) periodic functions 2, hm(x; l), hl(t; ), hn(t; ) representative maps dened earlier m, n, l zz. note integer k(x, t) equals (minus) soliton number q(g), whereas h(x, t) integer appears since q(h) = 0 account fact gauge transformations h must given d2 contractible. substituting (5.5) (5.4) nd i(gh) i(g) = (cid:18) 1 162(cid:19)(cid:18) 4n (cid:19)(cid:18) 4m l (cid:19)zi 2 dx dt = n q(g) , (5.6) is, condition (iii) fullled unless q(g) = 0. order extend domain i(g) nonvanishing soliton number sectors, possible procedure proposed  one imposes (partial) gauge xing condition g(x, t) spatial innity become time-independent, i.e., g(x, t)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)d2 = 0 . (5.7) indeed, excludes gauge transformations h(x, t) n 6= 0 d2, hence r.h.s. (5.6) vanishes irrespective soliton charge q(g). thus see that, upon imposing (5.7), integral i(g) denes topological invariant and, time, gauge invariant g. remains, therefore, nd meaning topological invariant dened. this, let us consider conguration, g(x, t) := g0 g1(x, 0) g(x, t) . (5.8) using additivity soliton number, q(g1g2) = q(g1) + q(g1) g1, g2 obeying (2.3), nd q(g) = 0. thus allowed regard g one converted g 11 time anti-soliton soliton figure 1. physical picture conversion procedure. given soliton conguration, evolves time shown right, procedure puts static anti-soliton left distance far soliton, entire soliton charge vanishes. hopf number gained dynamical evolution soliton. vanishing soliton number sector, integral i(g) (5.1) gives hopf invariant without imposing (5.7). hand, readily shown  that, condition (5.7) imposed, conversion change integral, i(g) = i(g). thus follows topological invariant dened g (5.7) nothing hopf invariant converted conguration g. note conversion vanishing soliton number sector far unique. how- ever, since integral (5.1) topological invariant, conversion form, g(x, t) := ga(x) g(x, t) , (5.9) gives value i(g) long static conguration ga soliton number opposite g q(g) = 0 (and may also require ga|d2 = 1 g still obeys (2.3)). observation allows following physical interpretation topological invariant assigned g. suppose original conguration g(x, t) soliton number n, localized nite domain space. choose ga(x) soliton number (n) also localized domain intersect domain g. conversion (5.9) places static anti-soliton ga somewhere far soliton g. roughly speaking, hopf invariant counts number twists made conguration 12 time interval , g twists performed soliton part. static anti-soliton play role this, except provides ground hopf invariant becomes well-dened nullifying soliton charge (see fig. 1). fact, physical picture originally used wilczek zee  discuss fractional spin (for case n = 1) initial soliton/anti-soliton pair creation annihilation nal time, case conversion made according (5.8) soliton g(x, t) stays far static anti-soliton ga(x) = g1(x, 0) except creation annihilation take place = 0 = , respectively. procedure presented provides mathematical ground picture, light nding well-dened topological invariant corresponding hopf invariant. also point possible carry procedure original description terms n, becomes involved one given exploits fully advantage group properties aop. 6. conclusion discussions paper discussed two types topological terms o(3) nsm, one soliton term (1 + 1) dimensions hopf term (1 + 1) dimensions. contrast soliton term well-dened derived unitary representation fundamental group conguration space c1, hopf term used literature ill-dened and, general expectation, cannot serve produce fractional spin statistics conventional form. argued conversion procedure, proposed earlier make hopf term well-dened equivalent partial gauge xing aop, natural mathematically physically. constructed hopf term topological invariant associated rst homotopy group (1.5), may ask also used wess-zumino term (1 + 1)-dimensional nsm. possibility arises fact second homotopy group conguration space c1 reads 2(c1) = 3(s2) = zz, (6.1) suggests nsm may admit associated topological term analogous wess-zumino term wess-zumino-novikov-witten model  second homotopy group. fact, usual wess-zumino term given precisely integral (5.1) = d3 whose boundary s2 identied (1 + 1)- dimensional spacetime. since nsm second homotopy group related 13 hopf bration, may expect topological term hopf term made well-dened. examine possibility, deniteness take spacetime s2, always possible since (1.6) obstacle deform congurations constant one. however observe taking extrapolated manifold = d3 wess- zumino term (4.2) possible, loop c1 given spacetime map n(x, t) cannot always deformed point due (1.5), unlike wess-zumino-novikov- witten model can. instead, may consider = s2i parameterized (x, t, ) extrapolation parameter  way map n(x, t, 1) := n(x, t) extended n(x, t, 0) given xed conguration possessing soliton number n(x, t). render integral (4.2) well-dened either, since integral changes gauge transformations yielding gauge dependent integral spacetime s2. situation unaltered even take three-dimensional manifold long contains s2 boundary , quality requisite wess-zumino term (1 + 1) dimensions. also note that, despite similarity present problem dening hopf term (2 + 1) dimensions, procedure adopted aop cannot employed here, one cannot use periodic boundary condition direction extrapolating parameter , done previous case role played time t. finally, mention construction gauge invariant topological terms wess-zumino term also discussed elsewhere  context coset models, list cohomology generators symmetric space g/h exhausted. however, amounts nding local gauge invariant integrand f f f f , rather directly seeking gauge invariant integral without assuming locality gauge invariance integrand. conclusion non-existence term, however, remains same. 14
