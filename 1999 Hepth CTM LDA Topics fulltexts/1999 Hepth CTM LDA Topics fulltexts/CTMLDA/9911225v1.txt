abstract

quantum corrections to legendre transformation are shown to cancel to

all orders in supersymmetric theories in path integral formalism. using this

result, lagrangians for auxiliary elds are generalized to non-quadratic forms.

in supersymmetric eective nonlinear lagrangians, the arbitrariness due to the

existence of quasi nambu-goldstone bosons is shown to disappear when local

auxiliary gauge elds are introduced.

1 introduction

legendre transformation plays an important role both in classical and quantum

physics. it appears when we change independent variables in classical mechanics.

in quantum physics, it is associated with fourier transformation. for example, let

us consider the following path integral,

i = z [d] exp(cid:20)iz d4x (ii  w (1,    , n))(cid:21) ,

(1.1)

where i(x) and i(x) (i = 1,    , n) are real scalar elds and w (1,    , n) is

an arbitrary function. in order to evaluate this integral, we expand the integrand

around the stationary path  dened by,


i (jj  w (1    n))|i=i = i  wi(1,    , n) = 0,

(1.2)

where subscript i denotes derivative with respect to i. then the integral can be

performed by the saddle point method

i = exp(cid:20)iz d4x (cid:18)ii  w (1,    , n)(cid:19)(cid:21)
z [d] exp

2w (1,    , n)

|i=i(  )i(  )j +   

 . (1.3)

where the rst factor is the classical contribution and the second factor consists of

quantum corrections. linear terms are absent because of eq. (1.2). the quadratic
terms provide a factor (det w()) 1
 2w
ij being the hesse matrix. remaining terms contribute to higher order quantum
corrections. thus, if we dene u(i) by

2 after the gaussian integration with (w)ij =

i = exp [iu(i)] ,

then the classical expression

u(i) = jj  w (1,    , n)

(1.4)

(1.5)

is just the lowest order approximation. unless w () is a quadratic form, there

are many higher order quantum corrections in general. in supersymmetric theories,

1

however, we show this classical expression is exact to all orders because of remarkable

cancellations of quantum corrections due to the supersymmetry.

this quantum legendre transform may have many applications. it can be ap-

plied to studies of supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models [1]. they can be dened

from linear sigma models by introducing auxiliary elds as lagrange multipliers. for

example, consider a lagrangian l = r d4k0(, ) + (r d2p () + c.c.), with the
canonical kahler potential, k0 = , and the superpotential p = 0g(). here,

0 is an auxiliary eld without kinetic terms. the path integral over 0 gives a

f-term constraint, g() = 0. by solving this equation and substituting to k0, we

obtain the kahler potential, for a nonlinear sigma model. if we consider the above

linear model as an eective theory, we have to use the more general kahler po-

tential k0 = f (), where f is an arbitrary function [2]. then the resulting kahler
potential is k = f ()|g()=0 [3, 4] after integrating out 0.

in order to obtain a supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model on a compact mani-

folds, we have to consider a gauged linear sigma model by introducing a vector super-
eld v as an auxiliary eld1, k0 = ev   cv , where c is called a fayet-iliopoulos
parameter. by solving the classical equation of motion for v , ev   c = 0, and

substituting back to k0, we obtain a kahler potential k = c log()+const., which

is no longer linear [5, 6]. this procedure can be considered as a kahler quotient

method [7] and is used to construct low energy eective theories of supersymmetric

gauge theories [8]. as an application of our exact quantum legendre transform,

we will show that use of the classical equation of motion for v can be justied in

the path integral formalism. moreover, as stated above, the kahler potential can

be generalized to k = f (ev )  cv with an arbitrary function f . one of the

main result of this paper is that we can show that this arbitrariness disappears after

integrating out the vector supereld.

as an example, by combining these two auxiliary eld methods, we construct

a nonlinear sigma model, whose target space is a compact homogeneous kahler

manifold so(n)/so(n  2)  u(1), from a linear model. the construction of the

1 although, we discuss the abelian model for the simplicity in the introduction, extension to

the non-abelian case will be discussed later.

2

hermitian symmetric spaces from linear models are discussed in a separate paper [9].

this paper is organized as follows. in section 1, we prove a theorem on the quan-

tum equivalence of auxiliary eld methods in supersymmetric theories. in section

2, we apply the theorem to supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models.

2 quantum legendre transformation

before proving the absence of quantum corrections, we summarize useful formulas

for our proof. vector superelds (real superelds) satisfy v  = v , and are written

in component elds as [16]

v (x, , ) = c(x) + i(x)  i (x)

next an arbitrary function of n vector superelds, f (v 1,    , v n), can be expanded

now we are ready to show the main result of this section, the absence of quantum

corrections to the legendre transform.

theorem 1. (the quantum legendre transformation.)

let i(x, , ) and i(x, , ) (i = 1,    , n) be vector superelds and w be a function
of i. then,

z [d] exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4 (ii  w (1,    , n))(cid:21) = exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4 u()(cid:21) .

(2.5)

here u() is dened by

u() = i()i  w (1(),    , n()),

where  is a solution of the stationary equation,


i (jj  w (1,    , n))|i=i = i  wi(1,    , n) = 0.

(2.6)

(2.7)

(proof) to show this, we calculate the path integral of  on the left hand side

explicitly, and then compare with the right hand side. by using eqs. (2.2) and

(2.3), the integrand of the left hand side can be written as the exponential of

when the correspondence between c and c is not unique, we should choose the

branch where det w(c) has a denite sign.

to prove the theorem, we calculate the d-term of u() by solving eq. (2.7) ex-

plicitly, and compare with  in eq. (2.15). using eq. (2.3), we can express eq. (2.7)

here we have not written the solutions for  and d, since they disappear when
the rst and second equations are substituted to eq. (2.8). the rst equation can
be solved implicitly by c. by substituting these equations to eq. (2.8), we conrm

that it coincides with eq. (2.15). (q.e.d.)

we give the chiral supereld version of theorem 1 in appendix a.

from the theorem 1, we can show the matrix version of the theorem 1 which

will be applied to the integration over the non-abelian vector superelds in the next

section.

corollary 1. (the matrix version of the quantum legendre transformation.)

let  and  be matrix valued vector superelds and w () is a scalar function of

.2 then,

z [d] exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4 (tr ()  w ())(cid:21) = exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4 u()(cid:21) .

(2.18)

here u() is dened as

u() = tr ( ())  w (cid:16) ()(cid:17) ,

where  is a solution of the stationary equation,



ij(cid:20)tr (  w ())(cid:21)|=  = ij  (cid:16)w ( )(cid:17)ij

= 0.

(2.19)

(2.20)

(proof) the proof is trivial, if we rewrite tr () = ijji and identify a pair of

indices ij with a index in theorem 1. (q.e.d.)

if the scalar function w () is written in a single trace as w () = tr w()

with a function w, its derivative with respect to  can be written as ij w () =
w()t
ij. note that, as in eq. (2.14), we must assume that the hessian has a denite
2 for example, it is a single trace of a function w: w () = tr w(). but it need not be a single

trace.

sign. however this assumption is automatically satised for the example in the next

section.

we derive one more useful corollary of the theorem 1, which will be used in the

proof of the theorem 2 in the next section.

corollary 2.

let i (i = 1,    , n) be vector superelds and w be a function of i. then,

z [d] exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4 w (1,    , n)(cid:21) = 1,

(2.21)

when the hessian wij = ijw (c) is positive denite.

(proof) by the theorem 1, the path integral of  is given by the solution i of the
stationary equation, wi(1,    , n)|i=i = 0. by using eq. (2.3), it can be written
in components as

wi( c 1

,    , c n

 ) = 0,

 = m i
i

 = n i

 = vi

 = i

 = di

 = 0,

(2.22)

if the the hessian, det w( c) is not zero. the solutions of the rst equations
i = c i

 are c-numbers. therefore, the left hand side

(lhs) = exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4 w (1,    , n)(cid:21)
,    , c n

= exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4 w ( c 1

 )(cid:21) = 1,

(2.23)

when the hessian is positive denite.(q.e.d.)

in the rest of this section, we prove that the path integral measure is invariant

under a change of variables in supersymmetric theories.

lemma 1. (the invariance of the measure.)

when two sets of n vector superelds are related by a nonsingular local transforma-

tion

i = f i(v 1,    , v n)

(i = 1,    , n),

the measure is invariant:

[d] = [dv ].

(2.27)

the measures in both coordinates are related by

[d] = j[dv ]

(2.28)

where j is a jacobian, j = sdet m. here, sdet is a superdeterminant of a 16n  16n

supermatrix m (8 bosonic and 8 fermionic components for each vector supereld),

whose diagonal blocks are all f i

j(cv ), and the o-diagonal part is nilpotent:

m = 116  f(cv ) + m ,

where (f)i

j = f i

j and m  is a nilpotent matrix. then, j can be written as

j = sdetm = exp(str log m),

where str is a supertrace. it can be calculated as4

sdetm = sdeta  sdetb,

log a = log(116  f(cv )),

log b = log(cid:16)116n + (116  f 1)m (cid:17) = xm>0

,(2.31)

3 note that the ranges of the variables remain unchanged except for c and cv , provided that

f i

j(cv ) 6= 0.
4 if we write m = ab, then from the equation,

log m = log(ab) = log a + log b +

1

2 [log a, log b] +   , we obtain a formula, sdetm = sdeta  sdetb.

9

where f 1 is the inverse matrix of f. since the supertrace of log a is zero due to the

cancellation of bosonic and fermionic contributions (8  8 = 0), sdeta = 1. because

m  is nilpotent, log b is also nilpotent, hence sdetb = 1 and j = 1. (q.e.d.)

the invariance of the measure also holds for matrix valued superelds.

lemma 2. (the invariance of measure for matrix valued superelds.)

let  and v be matrix valued vector superelds related by a local transformation

 = f (v ), then

[d] = [dv ],

(2.32)

where the measures are dened by [d] = qij dij and [dv ] = qij dvij.
(proof) the proof is trivial, since ij = f ij(v11,    , vn n ), where f ij are functions

of v11,    , vn n . (q.e.d.)

3 applications to nonlinear sigma models

in this section, we apply our results to show the equivalence of two lagrangians with

and without auxiliary elds. firstly, we apply the theorems obtained in the last sec-

tion to non-abelian gauge theories, where the vector superelds are auxiliary elds.

consider the n m matrix valued chiral superelds  belonging to the fundamental

representation of global symmetry u(n) and the anti-fundamental representation

of the gauge group u(m). the action of the global and gauge symmetries are as

follows:

  glgr

1,

(3.1)

where gl is a n  n matrix of u(n) and gr is a m  m matrix of u(m). the
gauge invariant lagrangian of  interacting with vector supereld v = v ata, where

ta are the lie algebra of u(m), reads

l = z d4k0(, , v ) = z d4(cid:16)tr (ev )  c tr v (cid:17) .

(3.2)

where c is the fayet-iliopoulos(fi) parameter.

10

as described in the introduction, we obtain the kahler potential of the nonlinear

sigma model, if we eliminate v by its equation of motion. as an application of the

theorem obtained in the last section, we show that this procedure is also justied at

the quantum level. we obtain the next corollary from the corollary 1.

corollary 3. (integrating out the non-abelian vector superelds.)

let  be a n  m matrix valued chiral supereld and v be a matrix valued vector

supereld v = v ata, where ta are m  m matrix of a lie algebra. then
z [dv ] exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4(cid:16)tr (ev )  c tr v (cid:17)(cid:21) = exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4 c log()(cid:21) . (3.3)

(proof) in corollary 1, we replace  and  by ev and , respectively. then the

left hand side can be calculated as

(lhs) = z [d] exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4 (tr ()  c tr log )(cid:21)

= exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4 u()(cid:21) = (rhs),

(3.4)

where u has been dened as u() = tr ( ())  c tr log () and () = c 1.

we used the lemma 2 in the rst equality and the corollary 1 in the second equality.

the constant term disappears by  integral as r d4(incinc log c) = 0. it is proven

in appendix b that the hessian det w in eq. (2.14) has denite sign. (q.e.d.)

secondly, we apply the theorems to show the uniqueness of the eective la-

grangian of the supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models on compact kahler mani-

folds.

when a global symmetry g is spontaneously broken, there appear nambu-

goldstone(ng) bosons corresponding to the broken generators. since a chiral super-

eld has two real scalar elds, the partner of a ng-boson may not be a ng-boson. if

this is the case, the partner of ng-boson is called a quasi nambu-goldstone(qng)

boson[10]. when there is no gauge symmetry, it is known that there must be at least

one qng boson [11], and the kahler potential of eective lagrangian is written as

an arbitrary function of the g invariants[10, 2, 11]. qng bosons correspond to the

non-compact directions of the target space, and bring the arbitrariness to the kahler

potential. on the other hand, the kahler potential has no arbitrariness [2, 12], if the

11

target space is comapact. our task in the rest of this section is to show that the ar-

bitrariness disappears in the process of eliminating the non-compact directions. we

introduce gauge elds, to eliminate the qng-bosons corresponding to non-compact

directions. when matrix valued chiral superelds  acquire the vacuum expectation

value, the most general eective kahler potential is written as [2, 11]

k0(, ) = f (cid:16)tr ()(cid:17) ,

(3.5)

where f is an arbitrary function brought by qng bosons.5 when we introduce gauge

elds to eliminate non-compact directions, the gauge invariant kahler potential

reads

k0 = f (cid:16)tr (ev )(cid:17)  c tr v.

(3.6)

the arbitrariness of kahler potential comes from the existence of the qng bosons.

hence, if the gauge elds absorb all the qng bosons, the target manifold becomes

compact[12], and the arbitrariness disappears after integrating out the vector super-

eld. we show that actually this is the case.6

firstly, we generalize the corollary 1 to the case where an arbitrary function

appears.

theorem 2.

let  and  be n  n matrix valued vector superelds. then an arbitrary function
f disappears for w () = c tr log  def= c tr w().

= z [d] exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4 (tr ()  w ())(cid:21) .

5 the low energy interactions of ng and qng bosons were obtained as low energy theorems [13].

low energy scattering amplitudes of ng bosons coincide with those of non-supersymmetric tho-

eries, despite of the existence of the arbitrariness. those of qng bosons coincide with those of

corresponding ng bosons. moreover, the arbitrariness appears in the interactions of ng and qng

bosons.

6 it was known that, at the classical level, this arbitrariness must disappear when v is eliminated

by using its equation of motion [14].

12

(proof) let us introduce the legendre transform w of the arbitrary function f

f () =   w (),

  w () = 0.

(3.8)

then, the arbitrary function of tr () can be linearized as follows

exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4f (tr ())(cid:21)
= z [d] exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4( tr ()  w ())(cid:21) .

by substituting this expression to the left hand side and introducing the rescaled

vector superelds  = , we obtain7

(lhs) = z [dd] exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4( tr ()  w ()  c tr w())(cid:21)

= z [dd] exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4(cid:16)tr ()  w ()  c tr w(cid:16)1(cid:17)(cid:17)(cid:21)
= z [d] exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4 (tr ()  c tr w())(cid:21) = (rhs).

(3.9)

where in the third equality, the decoupled  integral is evaluated by using the corol-

lary 2

(q.e.d.)

z [d] exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4(cid:16) w ()  cnw()(cid:17)(cid:21) = 1.

(3.10)

note that w () = c log  was essential to decouple the  integration, and it can

not be generalized to an arbitrary w . however it is sucient for our purpose to

show the following corollary.

corollary 4. (the uniqueness of the seed metric.)

consider the same set up as the corollary 3. then,

z [dv ] exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4(cid:16)f (cid:16)tr (ev )(cid:17)  c tr v (cid:17)(cid:21)

= z [dv ] exp(cid:20)iz d4xd4(tr (ev )  c tr v )(cid:21) .

(3.11)

(proof) this result directly follows from theorem 2 with the identication of  = ev

and  = . the triviality of the jacobian follows from lemma 2. (q.e.d.)

7 note that the jacobian is trivial by the lemma 1

13

this corollary shows that the arbitrariness in eective theories without gauge

interaction as eq. (3.5), disappears by the introduction of vector superelds as

eq. (3.6). hence, we obtain the same kahler potentials by the corollary 3. since the

local gauge symmetry eliminates the degrees of freedom in non-compact directions,

the obtained manifold becomes compact.

before closing this section, we give a simple example: so(n)/so(n  2) 
u(1) [9]. consider chiral superelds ~ belonging to the vector representation of
so(n). we impose a o(n) invariant constraint ~2 = 0 to dene a manifold. this

manifold is non-compact since the dening condition is invariant under the scale
transformation ~  ~. we can eliminate this scale invariance by introducing a u(1)

gauge eld for the local scale (complex phase) symmetry. the gauged lagrangian is

l = z d4(cid:16)f (ev ~ ~)  cv (cid:17) + (cid:18)z d2 g0~ 2 + c.c.(cid:19) ,

(3.12)

where v and 0 are auxiliary vector and chiral superelds. we use a rather uncon-

ventional so(n) basis such that the invariant metric becomes

j =

0

0

1

0 1n 2 0

1

0

0




.




then 0 integration gives the f-term constraint

~ 2 = ~t j ~ = 2ab + 2 = 0,

(3.13)

(3.14)

where we have put ~ t = (a, i, b). this equation can be easily solved as ~ t =
(a, i, 2/2a). our theory has a gauge invariance which has the degree of freedom
of a chiral supereld. to x the gauge, we put a = 1: ~ t = (1, i, 2/2). by the

corollaries 4 and 3, the integration of v gives the kahler potential,

k = c log(~ ~) = c log(cid:18)1 + ||2 +

1
4

22(cid:19) .

(3.15)

this is the kahler potential of a compact homogeneous kahler manifold, qn 2(c) =

so(n)/so(n  1)  u(1) [12, 4], which is called the quadratic surface [15]. if we

drop the f-term constraint, this becomes the kahler potential for the fubini-study

14

metric of cp n 1. hence, qn 2(c) is holomorphicaly embedded to cp n 1 by the

f-term constraint eq. (3.14).

the generalization to a broader class, namely the hermitian symmetric spaces is

discussed in a separated paper [9].

a chiral supereld version of the theorem 1

in this appendix, we give the chiral supereld version of the theorem 1 without any

proof.

theorem 3. (chiral supereld version.)

let i and i (i = 1,    , n) be chiral superelds and w be a function of i.

then,

z [d] exp i(cid:20)z d4xd2 (ii  w (1,    , n)) + (c.c.)(cid:21)
= exp i(cid:20)z d4xd2 u() + (c.c.)(cid:21) .

here u() is dened as

u() = i()i  w ( 1(),    , n()),

where  is a solution of the stationary equation,


i (jj  w (1,    , n))|i= i = i  wi( 1,    , n) = 0.

b deniteness of the sign of the hessian

(a.1)

(a.2)

(a.3)

let  be an n by n matrix. in this appendix, when w () = c tr log , we calculate

the hessian and show that its sign is denite. the hesse matrix is derivatives of w

15

by two ij variables:

wij,kl(c) =

2w (c)
ij kl

= c

1
ji
kl

.

from a derivative of an identity ij = ik1

kj, we obtain a formula

1
ji
kl

= 1

jk1

li.

then the hesse matrix can be calculated as

wij,kl(c) = c1

jk 1
li .

hence we can calculate hessian as8

det

n 2n 2

w = cn 2

(det 1)2n 2

.

this sign is denite as used in the proof of the corollary 3.
