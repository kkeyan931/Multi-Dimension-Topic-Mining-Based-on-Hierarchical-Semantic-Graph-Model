abstract

we present the action for a self-dual tensor in six dimensions, cou-
pled to a (2, 0) conformal supergravity background. this action
gives rise to the expected equations of motion. an alternative
look upon one of the gauge symmetries claries its role in the
supersymmetry transformation rules and the realisation of the
algebra.

1 introduction

the description of chiral bosons, antisymmetric 2p-forms in 4p + 2 dimen-
sions with (anti)self-dual eld strengths, in terms of an action has been a
longstanding problem. this was caused by the rst order self-duality con-
dition.
in 6 dimensions, the chiral boson is a (anti)self-dual two-tensor.
by giving up explicit lorentz invariance, it became possible to construct a
new class of actions [1, 2]. in [2], six-dimensional actions were constructed
with manifestly ve-dimensional lorentz invariance. a non-trivial check was
needed to prove six-dimensional covariance.

the construction of a manifestly lorentz invariant action has been estab-
lished by introducing one auxiliary scalar eld and two extra gauge symme-
tries in [3]. this auxiliary eld appears non-polynomially in the action and
in the two new local gauge symmetries. these bosonic symmetries make it
possible to gauge away the new scalar eld and reduce the number of degrees
of freedom of the tensor. the gauge xing of these symmetries in the bosonic
model is studied in [4].

in [5] was proven that this lorentz invariant action with a suitable gauge
xing (choosing a xed direction for the derivative of the scalar) gives rise
to the conjectured feynman rules and the gravitational anomalies as in [6].
self-dual tensors also appear in a supersymmetric context. depending on
the amount of chiral supersymmetry in six dimensions, the supersymmetric
tensor multiplet contains a (anti)self-dual tensor, 2 or 4 chiral spinors and
one or ve scalars. in [7] is proven that the action for the rigid (2, 0) tensor
multiplet is invariant under rigid superconformal symmetry. the geometrical
superspace treatment of the self-dual tensor multiplet is in [8].

the eld equations for the m5-brane [9, 10, 11] also contain a self-dual
tensor. the worldvolume action is constructed in [9]. the wz-term and the
relation to the rigid superconformal model appeared in [7]. up to now, a
model for interacting self-dual tensor multiplets is lacking. in [12] is proven
that this will not be a local interacting quantum eld theory. the supercon-
formal theory for a stack of n coinciding m5-branes would be relevant for
the ads7/cft6 version of the maldacena conjecture. some partial results
can be found in [13].

self-dual tensors appear naturally in string theory compactications, for
instance compactications of type i string theory on k3 [14], compactica-
tions of the heterotic string on k3 [15] and compactications of m-theory on
k3  s1/z2 [16] in the (1, 0) context and compactications of type iib on

1

k3 [17] with (2, 0) supersymmetry in six dimensions. the (anti)self-dual ten-
sors appear in two ways in gravitational theories. first, they are one of the
components of the gravitational multiplet in poincare [18, 19] and conformal
[20, 21] chiral supergravities in six dimensions. the rigidly supersymmetric
tensor multiplets can also be realised as matter multiplets in a supergravity
background.
in [22] the poincare actions for the multiplets with self-dual
tensors were constructed. the most general coupling of matter multiplets in
chiral theories with one supersymmetry can be found in [24]. these chiral
theories are anomalous. the (2, 0)-theory is anomaly free when 21 tensor
multiplets are coupled to supergravity [25].

by using superconformal techniques [26], the eld equations for the self-
dual tensor coupled to a (1, 0) and a (2, 0) conformal supergravity background
were derived in [20] and [21]. in [21], the gauge-xing of the relevant super-
conformal symmetries to end up with super-poincare symmetry, was done
and the description to go from the eld equations of the tensor multiplet
with (2, 0) to those with (1, 0) superconformal symmetry was given.

the aim of this paper is to give the action for the self-dual tensor multi-
plet, coupled to conformal (2, 0) supergravity. the consistency of the action
is checked by the derivation of the eld equations of [21]. we give the trans-
formation rules of the tensor multiplet that do not use the self-duality condi-
tion. these transformation rules are understood better by looking upon the
rst new symmetry as a gauge symmetry with the derivative of the auxiliary
scalar as its gauge eld. we also indicate how the algebra is changed when
these transformation rules for the tensor multiplet are used and the new
gauge symmetries are introduced. the transformation rules of the equations
of motion are given.

the paper is organised as follows. in section 2, the eld content of the
weyl multiplet is given. the (2, 0) tensor multiplet, its superconformal trans-
formation rules and its gauge transformation with respect to the new gauge
symmetries are studied. therefore, the auxiliary scalar eld is introduced
there. the gauge symmetries appear also in the algebra. in section 3, the
action and a sketch of the proof of its invariance under gauge and supercon-
formal symmetry is given. this action gives rise to the eld equations of
[21]. their (special) supersymmetry transformation rules are given. the last
section contains the conclusions.

2 (2, 0) superconformal multiplets

in this section, the superconformal gravitational multiplet and the self-dual
tensor multiplet are introduced. the notations and conventions of [21] are
used. the new gauge symmetries, essential to write down an action, are
dened. the role of the new symmetries in the transformation rules and the
algebra is claried.

the (2, 0) superconformal gravitational multiplet is a representation of
osp(8|4) [7]. the usual superconformal tensor calculus approach is followed
to construct the weyl multiplet: introducing gauge elds for the superconfor-
mal symmetries, constructing curvatures, imposing conventional constraints
and introducing matter elds. the weyl multiplet then has the following
 and b. it further contains the matter elds t ij
gauge elds: e
abc,
16 fermions in i
abc are
antiself-dual. other properties and the o-shell (special) supersymmetry
transformation rules for the weyl multiplet are given in [21].

there is only one matter multiplet in the chiral (2, 0) theory: a self-dual
tensor multiplet1. the following on-shell (special) supersymmetry transfor-
mation rules were used in [21]:

in (2.2), the rst term contains the self-dual part of the covariant eld
strength for the tensor:

h = 3[b] + 3 []  3

]ij  1

2ijt ij



(2.4)

in [21], the eld strength is dened without the matter term. this dierent
covariant eld strength makes no dierence in (2.2), since the last term is
 = 0,
antiself-dual. the self-duality equation for the tensor h 
eq. (4.5) in [21], is here

  1

2 ijt ij

1the antiself-dual tensor multiplet is a representation of the (0, 2) antichiral algebra.

h 

 = 0 .

(2.5)

3

this equation is used to realise the algebra with the supersymmetry trans-
formation rules of [21]. in section 3 is explained how it can be found from
the action (3.1).

the action for the self-dual tensor can be constructed by making use of
one auxiliary scalar a. this scalar does not transform under supersymmetry:

qa = 0 .

(2.6)

its derivative is u = a. it always appears in the action in the following
way:

v 

uugu

.

(2.7)

(2.8)

the contraction of the eld strength with v is dened as

h  hv .

there are three local bosonic gauge symmetries that act on the tensor and
this a-eld. the rst one is the usual reducible gauge transformation for a
antisymmetric tensor:

ib = [];

i a = 0 .

(2.9)

this gauge symmetry has a reducible component:

the two other gauge symmetries act in the following way on b and a:

 =  .

(2.10)

iib = 2h 



u2

iiib = u[] .

iia =  ,

(2.11)

(2.12)

all the other elds are inert under each of these three symmetries. the h 

in ii contains the covariant eld strength (2.4). also symmetry iii has a
zero mode:  = u.
the divergence of the scalar eld can be considered as the gauge eld of the
second symmetry, since u transforms into the derivative of the parameter:

iiu =  .

(2.13)

4

the commutators of these gauge symmetries are:

[ii(2), ii(1)] = iii(4

[ii(), iii()] = i ( 1

h 

(u2)3/2 (12  21)) ,
2) + iii(2[]  u 
u2 ) .

(2.14)

(2.15)

their role in the gauge-xing of the bosonic symmetries can be found in [4].
making use of these gauge symmetries, it is possible to write down other
supersymmetry transformation rules that realise the algebra without using
the self-duality condition (2.5). therefore, the self-dual component of the
eld strength in (2.2) will be replaced by a self-dual tensor, such that it gives
the old transformation rule upon imposing the self-duality condition (2.5):

h+
  1

4h  3

2v[h 

] .

(2.16)

the terms with v in (2.16) can be seen as the product of u, the gauge
eld of the second symmetry, and the ii-transformation of b. therefore,
h+
 can be considered as the fully covariant eld strength of b, where
fully means also with respect to gauge symmetry ii. h+
 is automatically
self-dual in this way. the new (special) supersymmetry transformation rule
is then:

i =

h+
i +

1
12

1
4 6dijj  ijj .

(2.17)

this transformation rule depends on the matter terms in h+
. this is nec-
essary to realise the algebra (2.18) (and later also to nd the invariance of
the action).
the covariant derivative of i and the covariant dalembertian of ij are
given in [21].

the algebra of q- and s-transformations contains eld-dependent trans-
formations. when using the transformation rules for the tensor multiplet
(2.1), (2.17) and (2.3), also gauge symmetry i and ii appear in this algebra:

(2.18)

(2.19)
(2.20)

some comments can be made about the terms in the algebra:
the d in the rst term of (2.18) is a covariant general coordinate transfor-
mation [26]. this includes all the superconformal transformations, and also
gauge symmetry ii. there is no natural gauge eld for symmetry iii and
it doesnt appear in the covariant derivative.
with u as the gauge eld for symmetry ii, the algebra on a becomes

[q(1), q(2)] a = 1
= 1
= 0 ,

2 21 da
2 21(a  u)

(2.21)

both for the rigid and the local supersymmetric case. so, a is a supersym-
metric singlet [27].

the term in the algebra with gauge transformation i was already intro-
duced in [21] for the case of the (1, 0) self-dual tensor. using the prescription
of appendix b in [21], it is possible to rederive the (1, 0)-algebra. the term
with the lorentz rotation and gauge symmetry i give immediately the right
term. the terms with special conformal and special supersymmetry need
more work. the relevant terms of the constraints and transformation rules
dier slightly for the dierent cases. also the shifts in i
a when going
to (1, 0) need to be taken into account.

 and f

finally, remark that the algebra is not o-shell realised.

in the trans-
 (3.8) still appears the equation of motion of the spinor.
formation of h 
therefore, also in the commutator of two supersymmetries on i appears an
equation of motion. also the commutator of symmetry ii with supersym-
metry contains terms with equations of motion.

3 the superconformal action

in [7] was already proven that the rigid model has superconformal invariance.
here we give the action for the self-dual tensor with local (2, 0) superconfor-
mal symmetry. we also see that the action, as expected, gives rise to the
equations of motion of [21].

the following action is invariant under local superconformal transforma-

tions and under the 3 bosonic symmetries (2.9), (2.11) and (2.12).

further, tij   = t abc
this action describes the coupling of a self-dual tensor in six dimensions to
a conformal supergravity background. the rst gauge symmetry imposes
that b only appears in a eld strength in the action. the second and the
third gauge symmetries impose the form of the action as given in (3.1) for
terms that transform with respect to one of these symmetries. the second
term contains only covariantisation terms. this wz-like term is imposed by
the third gauge symmetry and can also be found in the local super-poincare
actions for self-dual tensors [22]. it is absent for free chiral bosons. all the co-
ecients of the action are xed by imposing invariance under supersymmetry
and special supersymmetry.

the action (3.1) gives rise to the following eld equations for b, a, i

(3.6)

the equations (3.5) and (3.6) are the equations of motion as derived in
[21]. also the self-duality condition (2.5) was identical as in [21]. the only

7

dierence is the one but last term in (3.6). in [21], it appears with h +
thats because there, the self-duality condition is used.
rewriting the (3.3) gives:

, but

g =  (cid:16)vh 

 (cid:17) .

(3.7)

analogous to the rigid case, the self-duality condition (2.5) can be found by a
gauge-choice of symmetry iii for the most general solution of this equation
of motion (if there are no global obstructions). so, this action describes a
self-dual two-form.

the description using this action is more satisfactory than the one of [23].
there, rst the action for an ordinary tensor is written down and the equation
of motion is derived. only then, the self-duality condition is imposed. here
the self-duality is automatically incorporated in the action and follows from
the equation of motion.

the equations of motion transform in the following way into each other

4 conclusions

in this article we have interpreted the second bosonic symmetry as a gauge
symmetry with gauge eld u. its role in the supersymmetry transformation
rules and in the realisation of the osp(8|4)-algebra has become more clear.
it appears on the right hand side in the covariant general coordinate trans-
formation in the commutator of two supersymmetries. one also nds that
the auxiliary scalar a is a supersymmetric singlet.

furthermore, we have given the action for a self-dual tensor multiplet
coupled to a chiral conformal gravity background with (2, 0) supersymmetry.
this action gives rise to the equations of motion found earlier in [21]. the

8

self-duality follows from the action by imposing a gauge xing of symmetry
iii.

using the prescription of [21], the poincare action for n self-dual tensor
multiplets can be derived from this superconformal formulation. one starts
with n + 5 tensor multiplets in the vector representation of so(n, 5). impos-
ing the suitable constraints that gauge-x the appropriate superconformal
symmetries (dilatations, special conformal symmetry and special supersym-
metry) yields the coupling of n self-dual tensor multiplets to (2, 0) poincare
supergravity. the 5n scalars of these n tensor multiplets parametrize the
coset

so(n)so(5) [19, 21].

so(n,5)

using the dictionary in [21] to go from (2, 0) to (1, 0), one discovers the
action for a self-dual tensor multiplet in a (1, 0) superconformal gravity back-
ground. for this case, a similar procedure is possible to go to a poincare de-
scription. starting from n + 1 tensor multiplets in the vector representation
of so(n, 1) and imposing the right constraints will break the superconformal
symmetry. this should give the actions of [22]. the scalars in the poincare
theory are in so(n,1)
[19]. in this context with (1, 0) supersymmetry, cou-
so(n)
plings of actions for self-dual tensor multiplets to other matter multiplets are
possible.

an interesting project would be to calculate the conformal anomaly for
the self-dual tensor, e.g. by following the approach in [28] and using the
ghost sector of the action for the self-dual tensor of [4]. this weak-coupling
calculation can be compared with the strong-coupling result in [29].
