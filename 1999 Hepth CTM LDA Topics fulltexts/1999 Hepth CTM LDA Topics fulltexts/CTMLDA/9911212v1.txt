we construct operator representation of moyal algebra in the presence of fermionic elds.
the result is used to describe the matrix model in moyal formalism, that treat gauge
degrees of freedom and outer degrees of freedom equally.

1. introduction

outer degrees of freedom can be converted into gauge degrees of freedom through
compactication. the correspondence between a commutator of matrices and a
poisson bracket of functions used both in m-theory and iib matrix model implies
the fact. when we use the moyal formalism we can interpolate these two degrees
of freedom. there is, however, a problem which we have to overcome before we
apply the moyal formalism to the matrix model. namely there exists no moyal
formulation of fermionic elds, which is appropriate to describe a supersymmetric
theory. fairlie 1 was the rst who wrote the matrix model in moyal formalism.
the supersymmetry, however, has not been fully explored. the main purpose of
this article is to construct representation of moyal algebra to describe the matrix
model in moyal formalism, which treat outer degrees of freedom and the gauge ones
equally.

ishibashi et al. have proposed a matrix model which looks like the green-
schwarz action of type iib string 2 in the schild gauge 3 as a constructive denition
of string theory 4. this matrix model has the manifest lorentz invariance and
n = 2 space-time supersymmetry.

they claim that iib superstring theory can be regarded as a sort of classical limit
of a part of the matrix model. this correspondence is based on the relationship
between su(n ) and poisson algebra. it is, therefore, very interesting if we could
express the matrix model lagrangian and the green-schwarz action in a unied
form in terms of moyal algebra, since it is the unique one-parameter associative
deformation of the poisson algebra 5. we had a problem, however, that the corre-

spondence between su(n ) and poisson algebra has been shown in the case that the
theory involves only bosonic elds. on the other hand, we suggested an operator
formalism of moyal algebra in 6, which is a generalization of hamiltonian vector
eld. we think that the operator formalism is suitable for a description of matrix
model. therefore it is desirable to have an operator formalism of moyal algebra
including fermion elds. we will construct this in this article.

in the following two sections we review briey the iib matirx model and su(n )
 poisson correspondence. we introduce our fermionic moyal algebra in 4. based
on these arguments, we extend the matrix model in 5. this extended model has
coordinates which parameterize the world-sheet without the large n limit. our pro-
cedure is not restricted to the matrix model but can be applied to any system that
has u(n ) gauge invariance and supersymmetry. we will present, as an example,
the moyal extension of the n = 1 sym in 6.
2. iib matrix model

a large n reduced model has been proposed as a nonperturbative formulation

of type iib superstring theory4. it is dened by the following action:

sikkt = 

1

g2 tr(cid:18) 1

4

[a, a ][a, a] +

1
2

[a, ](cid:19) ,

(1)

here  is a ten dimensional majorana-weyl spinor eld, and a and  are n  n
hermitian matrices.
it is formulated in a manifestly covariant way which they
believe is a denite advantage over the light-cone formulation 7 to study the non-
perturbative issues of superstring theory.

this action can be related to the green-schwarz action of superstring 2 by using

the semiclassical correspondence in the large n limit:

where { , }p is a poisson bracket.
action in the schild gauge3:

in fact eq.(1) reduces to the green-schwarz

sschild =z d2(cid:20)pg(cid:18) 1

4{x , x }2

p 

i
2

{x , }p(cid:19) + pg(cid:21) .

through this correspondence, the eigenvalues of a matrices are identied with
the space-time coordinates x (). the n = 2 supersymmetry manifests itself in
sschild as 4

(1)x = i 1,

(5)

the n = 2 supersymmetry (4) and (5) are directly translated into the symmetry
of sikkt as

(1) =

[a, a] 1,

(1)a = i 1,

([a, a] := aa  a a)

and

(2) = 2,
(2)a = 0.

3. algebraic background

we consider the algebraic background of the correspondence (2).

the bases of su(n ) algebra can be written as 8

j(m1,m2) = m1m2/2gm1hm2 ,

where g and h are matrices

g =

which satisfy

gn = hn = 1,

hg = gh,  = exp (2i/n ) .

with these bases, su(n ) is expressed as, using the notation m = (m1, m2),

[jm, jn] = 2i sinh 
(0  mi, ni  n  1, m, n 6= 0)

(m  n)i jm+n,

n

on the other hand the poisson operator,

xf =

satises the commutation relation

[xf , xg] = x{f,g}p ,

which can be expressed as

[xm, xn] = (m  n)xm+n, xm := ieimq
in fourier components through the transformation f (q) = xm
fore (9) coincides, up to a constant factor, with (10) in the n   limit. it is this
accordance that underlies the correspondence (2) 8.

is the unique one-parameter associative deformation of the poisson bracket 5, and
the algebra (10) is modied into 8

[km, kn] =

1


sinh(m  n)i km+n,

(11)

thus we can see that moyal algebra corresponds to su(n ) when the parameter  is
set to /n , and to poisson algebra in the   0 limit.
4. moyal operator for a fermionic eld

a supersymmetric extension of the algebra (11) was discussed in 8

{f

[km, f 

n} = cos[(m  n)]km+n

sin [(m  n)] f

they are realized by

km =

m =

ei(2m1 p+m2 x),

[x, p] = i

as well as by

km =

f 

m =

eimq exp[(m  )].

(12)

(13)

(14)

we want to generalize this superalgebra to include elds. it should be done by
using the basis-independent dierential operator realization kf , which was intro-
duced in 8:

kf :=

1
2i

f(cid:18)x + i


p

, p  i



x(cid:19) .

(15)

however, a problem arises if we incorporate a fermionic eld in a similar way and
use the algebra (12). in (12) the eect of statistics has been taken into account
without reference to elds.

supersymmetric extension of moyal algebra . . .

5

there is an alternative realization of the moyal bracket for bosonic elds. we
have proposed in 6 a deformation of hamilton vector elds which provides moyal
bracket in the place of poisson bracket. it is a little modication of (15), which we
denote as bf :

bf

p 

sin(cid:20)(cid:18) 
sinh (  )i f (q

q(cid:19)(cid:21) f (q, p)

)

we can check that the commutation relation among the operators

[bf , bg] = bi{f,g}m

holds. there must be a fermionic counterpart of this operator in order to have a
supersymmetric algebra. to this end we introduce the following operator

(16)

(17)

(20)

f

cosh(cid:16)  (cid:17)i (q

)



q(cid:19)(cid:21) (q, p)

associated with a fermionic eld . then we are ready to convince ourselves that
the commutation relations

{f, f} = 2bi{,}m
[bf , f] = fi{f,}m

(21)

are correct, when the statistics of the elds are considered, where the moyal bracket
of fermions is dened as

{, }m = lim qq
pp

qq

q

1



p


p 

sin(cid:20)(cid:18) 
sinh (  )i (q)(q

).



q(cid:19)(cid:21) (q, p)(q, p)

moreover we can see that behind this superalgebra (18, 21) there exists an
algebra of generators which admit the su(n ) reduction. to show this we write the
operators in fourier components:

bf = xm
f = xm

fmbm,

mfm,

 f (q) =xm
 (q) =xm

fmeimq! ,
meimq! ,

(22)

6 supersymmetric extension of moyal algebra . . .

where

1


eimq sinh[(m  )]
bm :=
fm := eimq cosh[(m  )].

then the generators satisfy a closed algebra

i


sin [(m  n)] bm+n
[bm, bn] = 
[fm, fn] = i sin [(m  n)] bm+n
[bm, fn] = 
sin [(m  n)] fm+n

i


(23)

(24)

the structure constants of these commutators are not only all common, but also
agree with one of (11). therefore the reduction to the su(n ) algebra still remains
supersymmetric. we like to emphasize the apparent dierence of our commutators
from those of (12). the anticommutation relation between fermionic operators in
(21) arises due to the statistics of their elds.

5. moyal operator formalism in the matrix model

based on the arguments presented in the previous sections, we can express the
matrix model lagrangian and the green-schwarz action in a unied form in moyal
formalism as

1

g2 tr(cid:18) 1

4

[bx , bx ][bx , bx ] +

s = 
where [
] is a commutator of operators and not of matrices, and tr denotes
the integration over the world sheet parameters and the sum over the complete
set of functions on the world sheet. this action is invariant under the n = 2
transformations

f (cid:2)bx, f(cid:3)(cid:19)

(1)f = 
(1)bx = i 1f,

(cid:0) = 0bx 1bx  1bx 0bx(cid:1)

(26)

and

(2)f = 2,
(2)bx = 0.

(27)
it already has coordinates to parameterize the world-sheet without the   0 limit.
we would like to mention the dierence of our approach from one by fairlie 1.

the action proposed in this theory is

here the phase space variables ,  are introduced to parametrise the elds instead of
matrix indices. in this theory the commutators of matrices are deformed, while we
deform the matrices themselves and leave the operation of product as the same as the
operation of matrices. moreover the action (25) has manifest n = 2 supersymmetry.
6. conclusion

we considered the algebraic relationship behind the correspondence between iib
matrix model and the green-schwarz action and noticed that the both can be
described in a unied form in moyal formalism if the correspondence can be shown
even in the presence of fermionic elds. we have shown this correspondence by
constructing a closed algebra. although the extension is originally motivated by
the matrix model, our procedure is not restricted to that case but can be applied
to any system that has both u(n ) gauge invariance and supersymmetry. as an
example, we present a moyal extension of the n = 1 sym.

the n = 1 sym lagrangian density

as well as gauge transformations

where  is a transformation parameter.

when we describe sikkt in moyal formalism new degrees of freedom appear.
how should we interpret these ? it gives a clue to remember sikkt is originally a
low energy eective action of n coincident (1)-branes. the theory with a p-brane

8 supersymmetric extension of moyal algebra . . .

compactied in a direction perpendicular to the brane is t-dual to the theory with
a (p + 1)-brane compactied in a direction parallel to the brane. so the theory with
(1)-branes compactied twice in directions perpendicular to the branes is t-dual
to the theory with 1-branes compactifed in directions parallel to the branes. thus,
in dual picture, there are two parameters to parameterize the 1-branes. the two
parameters which appear when we describe the matrix model in moyal formalism
indicate that gauge degrees of freedom are obtained from outer degrees of freedom
through compactication and that moyal formalism treats these two degrees of
freedom equally.
