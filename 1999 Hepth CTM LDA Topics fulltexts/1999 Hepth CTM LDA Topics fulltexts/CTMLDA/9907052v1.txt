abstract

two-dimensional matterless dilaton gravity is a topological theory and can be
classically reduced to a (0+1)-dimensional theory with a nite number of degrees of
freedom. if quantization is performed, a simple gauge invariant quantum mechanics
is obtained. the properties of the gauge invariant operators and of the hilbert space
of physical states can be determined. in particular, for n -dimensional pure gravity
with (n  2)-dimensional spherical symmetry, the square of the adm mass operator
is self-adjoint, not the mass itself.

1 introduction

recently, the investigation of lower-dimensional gravitational models [1] has received a
large amount of attention because of its relation to higher-dimensional gravity, integrable
systems and black hole physics.

the aim of this paper is to discuss some interesting classical and quantum properties

of the (1+1)-dimensional model of dilaton gravity [2]-[6]

where  is the dilaton eld, w () is the dilaton potential, and r(2)(h) is the two-dimensional
ricci scalar. (here and throughout the paper we use landau-lifshits conventions [7] for
the ricci scalar and natural units.)

theories of the form (1) may arise from dimensional reduction of higher dimensional
gravity in presence of symmetries. a remarkable example is dimensional reduction of
spherically symmetric vacuum einstein-hilbert gravity in n > 2 dimensions

dilaton gravity theories dened by eq. (1) are classically integrable [3]. a number of

statements are equivalent:

i) dilaton gravity theories reduce to (0+1)-dimensional theories. any solution can be
represented (in suitable coordinates) as function of only one coordinate, a property
sometimes referred to as staticity property though the killing vector is not timelike
and orthogonal to a spacelike hypersurface on the entire manifold.

ii) dilaton gravity theories are topological theories.

iii) a locally conserved (gauge invariant) quantity exists (for spherically symmetric grav-
ity this coincides with the adm [8] mass of the system) and denes the horizon(s).

iv) the only gauge invariant quantities are the locally conserved quantity and its conju-

gate momentum.

these properties can be easily proved using the dilaton and the locally conserved quantity
(and their conjugates) as coordinates in the phase space (geometrodynamical variables
[4]).

a further, conjectured property that should be mentioned is the equivalence of dilaton
gravity theories to a couple of dalembert (free) elds (plus a single degree of freedom).

2

this is proved through the explicit identication of a canonical transformation in the case
of a potential of the form [3]

w () = aec + bed .

(6)

where a, b, c, d are constant parameters. however, in the general case the proof of existence
of a free eld representation [5] is not sucient for the explicit construction of the canonical
transformation.

these classical properties are an essential guideline in choosing the quantization scheme
so as to preserve them. this is evident in the scheme that has been worked out explicitly
in the case of the cghs model [6, 9, 10] using free elds, and in the general case using
geometrodynamical variables [4].

thanks to the staticity property, dilaton gravity can be quantized according to two
alternative approaches [11]. the rst approach is implemented by the explicit reduction
of the (1+1)-dimensional system to the couple of gauge invariant variables (the locally
conserved quantity and its conjugate momentum) (see e.g. [4, 12, 13]).
in the second
approach the system is classically reduced to a gauge (0+1)-dimensional problem and then
quantized, leading to a quantum mechanical theory. in both cases the ensuing quantum
theory is described by a hilbert space spanned by the eigenstates of the quantum operator
corresponding to the gauge invariant quantity (alternatively, its conjugate) and the two
approaches formally lead to the same hilbert space (quantum birkho theorem [4, 10,
11]).

although the two approaches are formally equivalent, the second method has the ad-
vantage that canonical quantities are explicitly represented as dierential operators, the
hilbert space is explicitly dened, and the hermiticity properties of operators are con-
trolled. this harvest of results is typical of the quantum mechanical approach and cannot
be obtained by the (1+1)-dimensional method, neither by the direct reduction to the cou-
ple of gauge invariant quantities nor by reduction to free elds. the quantum mechanical
approach has been worked in detail for the schwarzschild black hole system [14, 15]. in
this case, a remarkable result of the (0+1)-dimensional method is that the square of the
adm mass, not the adm mass itself, is self-adjoint.

in this paper we are interested in extending the quantum mechanical treatment origi-
nally developed for the schwarzschild black hole to the entire class of dilaton gravity models
described by eq. (1). our purpose is to show that the self-adjointness properties of the
quantum operators corresponding to the gauge invariant quantities depend on the particu-
lar model under consideration. in particular, we will show that the non self-adjointness of
the adm mass is not a general property of dilaton gravity theories: it holds for pure dilaton
theories that correspond to hyperspherically symmetric metrics and does not depend on
the dimension of space time.

these results suggest that the role of the schwarzschild black hole mass in gravity can
be claried by the simple quantum procedure model considered in this paper and that the
root of positivity of the adm mass in the schwarzschild black hole geometry can be found
in its quantum realization.

the outline of the paper is as follows.

in the next section we present the classical

3

canonical theory. in sect. 3 we focus attention on the models derived from dimensional
reduction of spherically symmetric gravity. finally, in sect. 4 we deal with the quantum
theory and discuss the self-adjointness of the relevant operators.

2 general canonical theory

we parametrize the two-dimensional metric h as [6]

g = (cid:18) 2  2





1(cid:19) .

(7)

here  > 0 and  > 0 play the role of the lapse function and of the shift vector respectively;
(x0, x1) represents the dynamical gravitational degree of freedom. the coordinates x0, x1
are both dened on r.

the hamiltonian form of eq. (1) is

where the super-hamiltonian and super-momentum are

s = z d2x h  +   h  pi ,




h =  +
p =  +  + 2
 ,

  2   w () ,

(8)

(9)

(10)

respectively. (we neglect boundary terms as they are irrelevant to the following discussion.
see e.g. [4, 9, 12] and references therein.)

according to the statement i) of sect. 1 any classical solution, in suitable coordinates,
can be written as a function of a single coordinate [3]. thus the problem is reduced to
a problem of nite degrees of freedom.
in the canonical framework we can impose the
staticity condition by requiring that both the metric and the dilaton and their momenta
depend on a single variable. setting

  (x0) ,

  (x0) ,   (x0) ,

  (x0) ,

  (x0),

the action (8) is cast in the form

where

s = z dx0 h  +   l(x0)hi ,

(11)

(12)

(13)

is a lagrange multiplier enforcing the constraint h = 0. the super-momentum constraint
dened in eq. (10) vanishes identically and h corresponds to the (0+1)-dimensional slice
of the super-hamiltonian in eq. (9). this is given by

l(x0)  (x0)

h =   w () .

4

(14)

two remarks are in order. firstly, the action (12) should be interpreted as a density action
in the coordinate x1, i.e. [s] = [length1]. alternatively, the coordinate x1 can be made
compact.
in this case we set for simplicity vol (x1) = 1. the second remark concerns
the denition of the lagrange multiplier l(x0). equation (13) is meaningful only if  has
denite sign. indeed, the gauge evolution parameter is a monotonic increasing function in
x0 on all trajectories provided that the lagrange multiplier has denite sign  at least on
the constraint surface. (possibly, some simple zeroes may be harmless but one cannot make
any general statement about this.) therefore, in the following we will restrict attention on
strictly positive values of . (the discussion for  < 0 is analogous and leads to the same
canonical equations, the only dierence being the overall sign of the gauge parameter.) this
condition can be lifted if one requires the continuity of the canonical variables at any space
time point. indeed, on the constraint surface the equation  = 0 denes the horizon(s)
of the two-dimensional metric (7)  see eq. (15) below. so, by requiring the continuity of
the canonical variables across the horizon(s) the dynamics generated by eqs. (12) and (14)
holds for any value of .

the gauge equations or, alternatively, the (unconstrained) equations of motion can be

easily integrated. the result is

 =

 = 2i[h + w ()] ,

 = 4i 2[n() + h  j/2] ,

where i and j are two gauge invariant quantities, n() = r d w (), and

dx0 l(x0)

 (x0) = z x0

(15)

(16)

is the gauge parameter. the gauge invariant quantities i and j can be written as functions
in the phase space:

i =

1
2

,

j = 2[n() + h  2
] .

(17)

(18)

clearly, since i and j are gauge invariant, their poisson brackets with h must vanish (at
least weakly). by direct calculation one can prove that actually the poisson brackets vanish
strongly. moreover one also nds [j, i]p = 1. by completing the triplet i, j, h by

y =




,

[y, h]p = 1 ,

(19)

one obtains a maximal set of gauge invariant canonical variables [16], often referred as
shanmugadhasan variables [17]. using the shanmugadhasan variables the action (12)
assumes the simpler form

s = z dx0 h ji + y h  l(x0)hi .

5

(20)

for sake of completeness let us note that the gauge invariant quantity j is related to the
(0+1)-dimensional slice of the conserved local quantity m as dened by [3] (see also [2, 18])

m = z 

0

w ()d

.

(21)

by a simple algebra one can prove that m|0+1 = j/2  h. we will see later that in
the spherically symmetric reduced models j coincides (apart from some numerical factors)
with the adm mass of the system.

let us conclude this section by an interesting remark concerning the support of the
gauge invariant quantity i. from the rst eq. (15) we see that i has the sign of .
indeed, since l(x0) > 0, we can take  positive. (in quantum mechanics one never gets the
feynman propagator without this positivity restriction, see e.g. [19, 20].) this property
will be essential in the following.

3 spherically symmetric gravity

we have mentioned in the introduction that (n  2)-spherically symmetric gravity in n
dimensions can be described by eq. (1) where the dilaton potential is given by eq. (4).
the connection with n-dimensional spherically symmetric gravity in the standard sch-
warzschild form can be better exploited using the schwarzschild-like canonical variables
(a, a; b, b) [14, 15] dened by the canonical transformation

by dening the new lagrange multiplier

the (0+1)-dimensional action (12) becomes

s = z dx0 h aa + bb  l(x0)hi ,

where

h =

k = (n  2)2(n  3) n 1

using the new canonical chart the n-dimensional metric (3) reads

variables the lagrange multiplier is

l(r) =

bn 4 .

(27)

for sake of completeness we give the (on-shell) expression of the gauge invariant variables
i and j in terms of the new canonical variables:

the horizons of the n-dimensional black hole are dened on the constraint shell h = 0 by

(34)

(35)

let us discuss the support of the canonical variables and of the gauge invariant quan-
tities. from eqs. (3) and (4) we have  > 0,  = 0 being a singularity of the metric.
(clearly, the same conclusion is obtained using the schwarzschild canonical variables. in-
deed, starting from the metric (26) we have b > 0 and the canonical transformation (22)
implies  > 0.) from the discussion at the end of the previous section it follows i > 0.
this property will play an essential role in the quantization of the system. the gauge

7

invariant variable j (and thus the adm mass) does not have a denite sign in general.
both positive and negative masses are allowed. in order to exclude negative adm masses
in spherically symmetric geometries we have to invoke a further, physically required, ad
hoc principle as it is usually the case, or we have to look for some mechanism responsible
for this property. curiously, this result is a bonus of the quantum theory of spherically
symmetric geometries, see next section.

4 quantization

the quantization of the model described in the previous sections leads to a quantum me-
chanical system with gauge invariance. here our treatment follows closely [15]. we im-
plement the quantization by the dirac method, quantizing rst and xing the gauge after
having solved the wheeler-de witt equation.

the quantization of the system is straightforward in the shanmugadhasan representa-

tion. formally, the quantization is achieved by imposing rst the commutation relations

[ j, i] = impl ,

[ y , h] = impl ,

(36)

and then by imposing the constraint as a null operator on the states in the hilbert space

h = 0 .

(37)

in order to represent the canonical coordinates as dierential operators we must rst choose
a pair of commuting variables as coordinates in the hilbert space and establish the form
of the (non-gauge xed) hilbert measure d. the measure d is determined by the re-
quirement that it is invariant under the symmetry transformations of the system, namely
under the rigid transformations generated by a couple of suitable gauge invariant quantities
f (i, j) and g(i, j) and under the gauge transformations generated by h. in this process
the support of the canonical variables is essential.

let us suppose that i and j are dened on the whole real axis. this happens for
instance when the dilaton potential w ()  see eq. (4)  is a well dened functional of
the dilaton for any value of . in this case we can choose y and i as coordinates in the
hilbert space. (alternatively, we might choose y and j, the two representations being
related by a fourier transform.) denoting by y, x, j the (continuous) eigenvalues of y , i,
j, respectively, the gauge and rigid invariant measure in the hilbert space is

the dierential representation of the operators is

d = dxdy .

i = x ,

j = impl


x

,

y = y ,

h = impl


y

.

(38)

(39)

8

by imposing the quantum constraint (37) we nd that the physical states do not depend
on y. a basis in the gauge xed (y = const) hilbert space  see [15] for details  is given
by the set of eigenstates of j with eigenvalue j

j(x) =

1

2mpl

eijx/mpl .

(40)

let us now suppose that the support of  does not coincide with the entire real axis and
consider for simplicity   r+. we have seen in the previous section that models describing
spherically symmetric einstein gravity in n-dimensions belong to this class. in this case
i > 0 from (15) and we cannot use the rigid symmetry generated by j to x the hilbert
measure since it changes the sign of i. following [14, 15] we dene the gauge invariant
dilatation generator n = ij. (the dilatation operator was also introduced in [21], to
avoid negative masses; here and in [14, 15] this result is obtained as a consequence of the
support properties of the conjugate variable i and of quantization.) it is easy to check that
n generates a symmetry that preserves the sign of i and can be used to determine the
hilbert measure. imposing the invariance under the rigid symmetries generated by n and
i the hilbert measure is

d =

dy ,

x > 0 .

(41)

dx
x

the measure (41) implies that the operator j is not self-adjoint being conjugate to a
positive denite operator. indeed, according to (41) the dierential representation of j is

j = implx


x

1
x

.

consequently, the eigenstates of j are

j(x) = c(j)xeixj/mpl .

(42)

(43)

it is straightforward to verify that j is not self-adjoint in the space dened by (41). a
self-adjoint operator in the space (41) is rather j 2. thus in spherically symmetric gravity
the square of the adm mass operator, not the adm mass operator, is self-adjoint.

for sake of completeness, let us give the eigenfunctions of j 2 (with eigenvalue j2). we

have two separate sets (j > 0)

(1)

j 2 (x) =

(2)

j 2 (x) =

1

1

qjmpl
qjmpl

x sin(jx/mpl) ,

x cos(jx/mpl) .

(44)

(45)

the eect of the non self-adjoint operator j is to transform the set (44) into the set (45)
and viceversa.

5 conclusions

the (0+1)-dimensional (static) canonical quantization of two-dimensional matterless
dilaton gravity shows that the self-adjointness of gauge invariant operators depends on
in particular, the gauge invariant operator j that
the global properties of the model.
identies the horizon(s) of the metric may not have a self-adjoint extension. this happens
for models describing spherically symmetric gravity in n dimensions. in this case j is 
apart from a numerical factor  the gauge invariant operator corresponding to the adm
mass of the geometry. consequently, the adm mass operator is not self-adjoint. instead,
its square is self-adjoint and its eigenfunctions can be dened in the hilbert space (with
positive eigenvalues of course). this result (obtained in [14] and [15] for the schwarzschild
black hole) may be the key to dispose of an ad hoc principle to eliminate negative masses
in spherical geometries, since the only admissible operator is the square of the mass. see
also the discussion contained in [21] where the use of the operator n is advocated as a
principle to avoid negative values of the mass.

regardless of the dilaton potential chosen in eq. (1), both j 2 and j (when the lat-
ter can be dened) have continuous spectra. this result is in agreement with the group
theoretical quantization of so(3)-symmetric four-dimensional gravity via reduction to a
sl(2,r)/so(2) non-linear sigma model coupled to three-dimensional gravity [22, 23].

quantization of the mass can be achieved by changing the boundary conditions. for
examples of this procedure, we refer to [15] and especially to [21] where further references
can be found. let us remark that there are indications for a discrete mass spectrum to
be obtained by inclusion of matter in the system. evidence supporting this conjecture can
be found in [24] where the quantization of spherically symmetric gravity coupled to a thin
dust shell is derived.
