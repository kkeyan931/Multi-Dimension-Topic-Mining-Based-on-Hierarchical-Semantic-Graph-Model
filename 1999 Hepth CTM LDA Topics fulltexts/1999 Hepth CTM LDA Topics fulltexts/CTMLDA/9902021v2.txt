abstract. the dirac equation for a massive spin- 1

2 eld in a central potential v in three
dimensions is studied without xing a priori the functional form of v . the second-order

equations for the radial parts of the spinor wave function are shown to involve a squared

dirac operator for the free case, whose essential self-adjointness is proved by using the weyl

limit point-limit circle criterion, and a perturbation resulting from the potential. one

then nds that a potential of coulomb type in the dirac equation leads to a potential term

in the above second-order equations which is not even innitesimally form-bounded with

respect to the free operator. moreover, the conditions ensuring essential self-adjointness

of the second-order operators in the interacting case are changed with respect to the free

case, i.e. they are expressed by a majorization involving the parameter in the coulomb

potential and the angular momentum quantum number. the same methods are applied

to the analysis of coupled eigenvalue equations when the anomalous magnetic moment of

the electron is not neglected.

1. introduction

in the same year when dirac derived the relativistic wave equation for the electron [1],

the work of darwin and gordon had already exactly solved such equation in a coulomb

potential in three spatial dimensions [2, 3]. since those early days, several eorts have

been produced in the literature to solve the dirac equation with other forms of central

potentials, until the recent theoretical attempts to describe quark connement [48]. in

massive spin- 1

the present paper we study the mathematical foundations of the eigenvalue problem for a
2 eld in a central potential v (r) on r3, without specifying a priori which
function we choose for v (r). in other words, we prefer to draw conclusions on v (r) from

a careful mathematical investigation.

by doing so, we hope to elucidate the general framework of relativistic eigenvalue

problems on the one hand, and to develop powerful tools to understand some key features

of central potentials on the other. for this purpose, in section 2 we focus on the radial parts

of the spinor wave function, casting the corresponding second-order dierential operators

in a convenient form for the subsequent analysis. in section 3, the weyl limit point-limit

essentially self-adjoint on the set c

circle criterion [9] is used to prove that the squared dirac operator for the free problem is
0 (0, ) of smooth functions on (0, ) with compact
support away from the origin. in section 4 some boundedness criteria for perturbations [9,

10] are rst described and then applied when the potential in the original dirac equation

consists of terms of coulomb and/or linear type. the eects of the anomalous magnetic

moment of the electron are studied in section 5. concluding remarks and open problems

are presented in section 6.

2. second-order equations for stationary states

for a charged particle with spin in a central eld, the angular momentum operator and

the parity operator with respect to the origin of the coordinate system commute with the

hamiltonian. thus, states with denite energy, angular momentum and parity occur. the

2

corresponding spinor wave function for stationary states reads [11, 12]

where j,l,m and j,l,m are the spinor harmonics dened, for example, in [11, 12], and
l = j  1

2 , l = 2j  l.

the stationary dirac equation in a central potential v (r) takes the form (m0 being

the rest mass of the particle of linear momentum ~p)

(cid:18) m0c2 + v (r)

~  ~p

m0c2 + v (r)(cid:19)(cid:18)

(cid:19) = e(cid:18)

and leads eventually to the following coupled system of rst-order dierential equations
(having dened f (r)  rf (r) and g(r)  rg(r)):

equation (2.6) should be supplemented by the boundary condition g(0) = 0.

it then

describes a sturmliouville equation non-linear in the spectral parameter.

in [13], the

equivalence has been proved of the radial dirac equations (2.1) and (2.2) to the parameter-

dependent sturmliouville equation (2.6) (the parameter  used in [13] corresponds to our

e, and m0c2 = 1 units are used therein). by equivalence we mean that, under suitable

prescribed space h 1

assumptions on the potential, the function g solving eq. (2.6) is found to belong to the
0 (r+), i.e. the space of absolutely continuous functions on [0, ) which
are square-integrable on r+ jointly with their rst derivative and vanish at the origin. now

we can use a well known technique to transform eq. (2.6) into a second-order equation

where the coecient of d

dr vanishes. this is achieved by dening the new function  such

that [14]

(r)  g(r) exp

1

2z p(r)dr.

(2.9)

in the few cases where exact analytic formulae are available in the literature one studies

indeed eq.

(2.6) and its countepart for f (see eq.

(2.13)). however, eq.

(2.9) has

the advantage of leading to a second-order equation for  in a form as close as possible

to perturbations of schrodinger operators, and is hence preferred in our paper devoted

to qualitative and structural properties.

in non-relativistic quantum mechanics, such a

method leads to a unitary map [9] transforming the radial schrodinger equation in a
central potential into an equation involving a radial schrodinger operator  d2
dr2 + u (r)
acting on square-integrable functions on r+ which vanish at the origin. in our relativistic

eigenvalue problem the transformation of the hilbert space of square-integrable functions is

no longer unitary, but remains of practical value. all non-linear properties of the resulting

sturmliouville boundary-value problem are in fact encoded into a single function playing

4

the role of parameter-dependent potential term (see below), rather than two functions p

and q as in (2.6)(2.8). the function  is then found to obey the dierential equation

(2.10)

(2.11)

such an equation may be viewed as follows: since the potential w perturbs the free

problem for which w vanishes in eqs. (2.1) and (2.2), in the corresponding second-order

equation (2.10) one deals with a free operator

al

d2

l(l + 1)

r2

for all l = 0, 1, ...

(2.12)

perturbed by the multiplication operator pw,e(r) dened in (2.11). an interesting pro-

gramme is therefore emerging at this stage:

(i) first, prove (essential) self-adjointness of the free operator al

r on a certain domain.

(ii) second, try to understand whether the operator al

r + pw,e(r) in eq. (2.10) remains

self-adjoint on the same domain.

if this condition is too restrictive, try to derive all

properties of this perturbed second-order operator.

if one rst uses eq. (2.2) to relate g(r) to df

dr and f , one nds instead the sturm

liouville equation (cf [13])

note that pw,e(r) has a second-order pole at 1 = w (see (2.11)) and epw,e(r) has a

second-order pole at 2 = w . thus, the analysis of the interacting case (i.e. with
w (r) 6= 0) is performed in section 4 at xed values of e and away from such singular
points.

3. weyl criterion for the squared dirac operator in the free case

the self-adjointness properties of the free operator (2.12) should be studied by considering

separately the case l > 0 and the case l = 0. for positive values of the quantum number

l, al

r turns out to be essentially self-adjoint. this means, by denition, that its closure

6

(i.e. the smallest closed extension) is self-adjoint, which implies that a unique self-adjoint

extension of al

r exists [15]. in general, if several self-adjoint extensions exist, one has to

understand which one should be chosen, since they are distinguished by the physics of the

system being described [9, 15]. this is why it is so desirable to make sure that the operator

under investigation is essentially self-adjoint. we here rely on a criterion due to weyl, and

the key steps are as follows [9].

the function v is in the limit circle case at zero if for some, and therefore all , all

solutions of the equation

(cid:20)

d2

dx2 + v (x)(cid:21) (x) = (x)

are square integrable at zero, i.e. for them

z a
0 |(x)|2dx < 

(3.1)

(3.2)

with nite values of a, e.g. a ]0, 1]. if v (x) is not in the limit circle case at zero, it is
said to be in the limit point case at zero. the weyl limit point-limit circle criterion states
that, if v is a continuous real-valued function on (0, ), then the operator

o  

d2
dx2 + v (x)

(3.3)

is essentially self-adjoint on c

0 (0, ) if and only if v (x) is in the limit point case at both

zero and innity. the property of being in the limit point at zero relies on [9]

theorem 3.1 let v be continuous and positive near zero. if

v (x) 

x2

3
4

(3.4)

near zero, then o is in the limit point case at zero.

the limit point property at  means that the limit circle condition at  is not

fullled, i.e. the condition

z 

a

|(x)|2dx < 

7

(3.5)

does not hold. to understand when this happens, one can use [9]

theorem 3.2 if v is dierentiable on (0, ) and bounded above by a parameter k on
[1, ), and if

z 
v (x)|v (x)| 3
then v (x) is in the limit point case at .

1

2

dx

pk  v (x)

= 

is bounded near 

(3.6)

(3.7)

thus, a necessary and sucient condition for the existence of a unique self-adjoint exten-
sion of o is that its eigenfunctions should fail to be square integrable at zero and at .
powerful operational criteria are provided by the check of (3.4), (3.6) and (3.7), which only

involve the potential.

in our problem, for all l  1, the potential evl(r)  l(l+1)

point at zero, since the inequality (3.4) is then satised. moreover, evl(r) is dierentiable

on (0, ), bounded above by l  l(l + 1) on [1, ), and such that

is of course in the limit

dx = 

for all r.

(3.8)

(3.9)

hence all conditions of theorem 3.2 are satised, which implies that evl(r) is in the limit

point at  as well. by virtue of the weyl limit point-limit circle criterion, the free operator
r dened in (2.12) is then essentially self-adjoint on c
al

0 (0, ) for all l > 0.

when l = 0, however (for which k = 1), al

dr2 , which
has deciency indices (1, 1). recall that for an (unbounded) operator b with adjoint b,
deciency indices are the dimensions of the spaces of solutions of the equations bu = iu.
more precisely, one denes rst the deciency sub-spaces (d(b) being the domain of b)

r reduces to the operator  d2

h+(b) (cid:8)u  d(b) : bu = iu(cid:9)

8

(3.10)

with corresponding deciency indices

h(b) (cid:8)u  d(b) : bu = iu(cid:9)

n+(b)  dim h+(b)

n(b)  dim h(b).

(3.11)

(3.12)

(3.13)

the operator b is self-adjoint if and only if n+(b) = n(b) = 0, but has self-adjoint

extensions provided that n+(b) = n(b) [9, 15].

in our case, half of the solutions of

the equations (a0

r)

u = iu are square-integrable on r+, which implies that n+(a0

r) =

n(a0

r) = 1. this is easily proved because such equations with complex eigenvalues reduce

to the ordinary dierential equation [9]

and

d2
dr2 er = ier



d2
dr2 er = ier.



(3.14)

(3.15)

in the former case, on setting  = ei, with  and   r, one nds  = 1,  =

which leads to the two roots of the equation 2 = i:

9

(3.18)

(3.19)

only the roots 2 and 2 are compatible with the request of square-integrable solutions
of (3.14) and (3.15) on r+, and hence one nds n+(a0
this property implies that a one-parameter family of self-adjoint extensions of a0

r) = 1 as we anticipated.

r) = n(a0

r exists,

with domain d(a0

r) given by

r) =(cid:8)u  l2(r+) : u, u  acloc(r+); u  l2(r+);
d(a0
u(0) = u(0)} .

(3.20)

here acloc(r+) denotes the set of locally absolutely continuous functions on the positive

half-line, the prime denotes dierentiation with respect to r, and  is a real-valued param-

eter. bearing in mind the limiting form of eq. (2.10) when l = 0 and w = 0, this means

that one is studying the case characterized by

r and v in the domain of the adjoint (a0

r). one then nds that both u

and v should obey the boundary condition (3.20). in the light of (3.20)(3.22) one obtains

the very useful formula

which implies

1 = p||

e2 = m2

0c4 

h2c2
2

.

10

(3.23)

(3.24)

this means that in a relativistic problem a lower limit for 2 (and hence for ||) exists, to
avoid having e2 < 0.

to complete the analysis of squared dirac operators in the free case, one has also to

(l+1)(l+2)

r2

consider the operators eal

r dened in (2.19a) and (2.19b). the former has a potential term
which is in the limit point case at both zero and innity for all l  0. the latter
r2 which is in the limit point at zero with the exception of the

has a potential term l(l1)

dr2 , and hence
we repeat the logical steps proving that such an operator has a one-parameter family of

value 1 of the quantum number l, for which eal

r reduces to the operator  d2

self-adjoint extensions. once more, their domain is given by eq. (3.20).

4. second-order operators in the interacting case

now we would like to understand whether the general results on perturbations of self-

adjoint operators make it possible to obtain a better understanding of eects produced by

the central potential w (r) in eqs. (2.10) and (2.17) (the essential self-adjointness of the

dirac hamiltonian with non-vanishing w is studied in [16], and several comments can be

found in the following sections). for this purpose, the key steps are as follows [9].

(i) let a and b be densely dened linear operators on a hilbert space h with domains
d(a) and d(b), respectively. if d(a)  d(b) and if, for some a and b in r,

kbk  a kak + b kk for all   d(a)

(4.1)

then b is said to be a-bounded. the inmum of such a is called the relative bound of b with

respect to a. if the relative bound vanishes, the operator b is said to be innitesimally

small with respect to a.

(ii) the katorellich theorem states that if a is self-adjoint, b is symmetric, and b is

a-bounded with relative bound a < 1, then a + b is self-adjoint on d(a).

(iii) if the potential v can be written as

v = v1 + v2

11

(4.2)

with v1  l2(r3) and v2  l(r3), and if v is real-valued, then the operator  +v (x)
is essentially self-adjoint on c
0 (r3) and self-adjoint on d(). as a corollary, the
operator    e2
(iv) an analogue of the katorellich theorem exists which can be used to study the case

r is essentially self-adjoint on c

0 (r3).

when b is not a-bounded. the result can be stated after recalling the following denitions.

let a be a self-adjoint operator on h. on passing to a spectral representation of a

with associated measures {n}n
on the direct sum n

n=1l2(r, dn), one can consider

n=1 on the spectrum of a, so that a is multiplication by x

i ({n(x)}n

n=1 :

 |x||n(x)|2dn < )

nxn=1z 

and hence dene, for  and   i,

q(, ) 

nxn=1z 



x

n(x)n(x)dn.

such a q is called the quadratic form associated with a, and one writes

q(a)  i.

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

the form domain of the operator a is then, by denition, q(a), and can be viewed as the

largest domain on which q can be dened.

(v) the klmn theorem states that, if a is a positive self-adjoint operator and if (, )

is a symmetric quadratic form on q(a) such that

|(, )|  a(, a) + b(, ) for all   d(a)

for some a < 1 and b  r, then there exists a unique self-adjoint operator c with

q(c) = q(a)

12

(4.6)

(4.7)

and

(, c) = (, a) + (, ) for all ,   q(c).

(4.8)

such a c is bounded below by b.

(vi) if a is a positive self-adjoint operator, and b is a self-adjoint operator such that

q(a)  q(b)

and

|(, b)|  a(, a) + b(, ) for all   d(a)

(4.9)

(4.10)

for some a > 0 and b  r, then b is said to be relatively form-bounded with respect
to a. furthermore, if a can be chosen arbitrarily small, b is said to be innitesimally

form-bounded with respect to a.

(vii) if the operator b is self-adjoint and relatively form-bounded, the parameter a being

< 1, with respect to a positive self-adjoint operator a, then the klmn theorem makes

it possible to dene the sum a + b, although this mathematical construction may dier

from the operator sum.

in particular, b can be form-bounded with respect to a even

though the intersection of their domains may be the empty set.

(viii) the klmn theorem is physically relevant because it leads to the denition of hamil-

tonians even when the katorellich criterion is not fullled. in other words, the request of
dealing with l2+l potentials is too restrictive. for example, the potential v(r) = r
2 , 2(cid:1), one can use the klmn theo-
belongs to l2 + l only if  < 3
rem because, for all  < 2, one can prove that r is innitesimally form-bounded with
respect to  [9].

2 . however, if  (cid:2) 3

in our problem, the potential terms in eqs. (2.10) and (2.17) are given by (2.11) and

(2.18), respectively. if the potential w (r) is of coulomb type, i.e. ( being a dimensionful

constant)

w (r) =


r

13

(4.11)

the singular behaviour of pw,e(r) as r  0 is dominated by (for a xed value of e)

(2 + 1
4 + k)
r2



and the singular behaviour of epw,e(r) as r  0 is given instead by (again for a xed value

of e)

(2 + 1
4  k)
r2

.



thus, as r  0, the operators on the left-hand sides of both (2.10) and (2.17) reduce to

lr "

d2

4(cid:1)
dr2 +(cid:0)k2  2  1

r2

# .

(4.12)

in the operator lr, the coecient of r2 is no longer greater than or equal to 3

4 (see
(3.4)) for the same values of l ensuring essential self-adjointness of the free problem. the

inequality

is instead fullled by

if k = l  1, and by

k2  2

(4.13)

(4.14)

(4.15)

if k = l. our result implies that, for all |k|  2, essential self-adjointness on c
0 (0, ) of
the second-order operators on the left-hand sides of (2.10) and (2.17) is obtained provided
that ||  3. this reects the fact that a coulomb potential in the rst-order system (2.1)

and (2.2) leads to potential terms in the second-order equations (2.10) and (2.17) which

are not even innitesimally form-bounded with respect to the squared dirac operators

in the free case, because both the potential terms and the free operators contain terms

14

proportional to r2. to study the limit point condition at innity, we try to majorize the

potential pw,e obtained from the coulomb potential (4.11), and we nd that

|pw,e(r)|  2|e|

+h|(1 + k)|(1 + ||) + 3

if r  [1, ). moreover, the integral (3.6) diverges when v is replaced by pw,e, and the
condition (3.7) is fullled as well, because

w,e(r)|pw,e(r)| 3

the check of (3.6) and (3.7) for epw,e leads to the same results, and hence we use the weyl

0 (0, ) of the second-order operators in eqs. (2.10) and (2.17) holds provided that the

the limiting form (4.12) is not aected by the addition of parts linear in r [6, 17, 18]

to the right-hand side of (4.11), because the singular behaviour of pw,e(r) at xed values
of e as r  0 is still dominated by the coulomb potential. by contrast, a purely linear
potential

w (r) = r

(4.16)

satises the request of innitesimal form-boundedness of pw,e(r) with respect to the

squared dirac operators in the free case, because then the singular behaviour of pw,e(r)

as r  0 is expressed by  k
r .
however, one might consider linear terms with compact support, i.e. vanishing for all r

r and the singular part of epw,e(r) as r  0 reads  k

condition at innity, e.g. the potential (cf [17])

w (r) =

where  is positive.
in such a case, the limiting behaviours of pw,e as r  0 and as
r   are still dominated by the coulomb part in the potential w , and hence we nd
again essential self-adjointness on c

0 (0, ) provided that k2  2  1.

in the physical literature, however, the potential has not been written in the form

(4.17). to achieve quark connement, a purely linear term has instead been added to

the coulomb part, considering also a split of the additional part into lorentz scalar-type

and lorentz vector-like potentials. furthermore, such a vector contribution is sometimes

omitted in a phenomenological analysis, bearing in mind its non-perturbative nature (since

the perturbative part has instead vector nature) [19]. needless to say, such arguments are

not compelling.

5. inclusion of the anomalous magnetic moment

the second-order operators that we have analyzed in the interacting case (see again eqs.

(2.10) and (2.17)) are not squared dirac operators because the eigenvalues of the dirac

operator occur in their potential term. it is therefore important to compare more carefully

the predictions of the second-order equation for  (and e) with the results obtained from

squared dirac operators studied in [16]. the latter are used in [16] because a theorem

ensures that, given the (abstract) dirac hamiltonian

t =(cid:18) 0 d

d+

0 (cid:19) +(cid:18) w+

0 w(cid:19)

0

(5.1)

if one of the operators dd+ or d+d is essentially self-adjoint, then the operator t is

essentially self-adjoint as well, where w+ and w take into account the rest mass and the

potential (see theorem 5.9 in [16]).

let us now consider the eect of the anomalous magnetic moment  of the electron in

a central potential v (r). with the notation of our section 2, the resulting set of coupled

eigenvalue equations is found to be [16]

(cid:20) d

(5.4)

(5.5)

for example, if a potential w of coulomb type is considered, one nds from (4.11) and
(5.5) that the limiting form of the eigenvalue equation (5.4) as r  0 is entirely dominated
by the term proportional to . more precisely, in such a limit eq. (5.4) reduces to

an analogous method can be used fore(r) dened in (2.16), nding a parameter-dependent

(5.8)

which leads again to the limiting behaviour (5.7) when w (r) = 
r  0. we can therefore see, in a physically relevant example, that our approach, leading

r , but now for e(r), as
to second-order equations for  and e, recovers qualitative agreement with the analysis

in [16], where it is shown that, no matter how singular is the central potential at r = 0,
the dirac operator is always well dened as long as  6= 0. in other words, our formula
(5.5) accounts clearly for the dominating eect of the anomalous magnetic moment with all

potentials diverging at the origin. however, a rigorous result on the relation between our

17

approach and the squared dirac operators studied in [16] remains an interesting technical
problem whenever w (r) 6= 0 (cf [13]).

6. concluding remarks

the contributions of our paper, of technical nature, consist in the application of analytic

techniques that can help to understand some key qualitative features of central potentials

for the dirac equation, with emphasis on the mathematical formulation of relativistic

eigenvalue problems. although the methods used in our investigation are well known

in the literature, the overall picture remains, to our knowledge, original (see comments

below). in particular, we would like to mention the following points (at the risk of slight

repetitions).

(i) the forms (2.10) and (2.17) of the second-order equations for the radial parts of the

spinor wave function, with pw,e(r) and epw,e(r) dened in (2.11) and (2.18), respectively,

is very convenient if one wants to understand whether the potential can aect the self-

adjointness domain of the free problem.

(ii) the identication of the domains of (essential) self-adjointness of the operators dened

in (2.12), (2.19a) and (2.19b) is helpful as a rst step towards the problem with non-

vanishing potential w (r), and claries the general framework.

(iii) a potential of coulomb type, although quite desirable from a physical point of view,

leads to some non-trivial features with respect to the non-relativistic case. we have in fact

seen that pw,e(r) and epw,e(r) fail to be innitesimally form-bounded with respect to the

squared dirac operators in the free case, if w (r) contains a coulomb term. moreover,

the limit-point condition at zero for the potential in the second-order operators in the

essential self-adjointness on c

interacting case is only fullled if the inequalities (4.14) or (4.15) hold. in other words, the
0 (0, ) of the second-order operators with non-vanishing
potential is still obtained, but under more restrictive conditions expressed by (4.14) and

(4.15). this may have non-trivial physical implications: if essential self-adjointness fails

to hold, we know from section 3 that dierent self-adjoint extensions of the second-order

18

operators exist, characterized by the choice of regular boundary condition at r = 0 (cf

(3.20)). the lowest values of l (for which (4.13) does not hold), corresponding to the

bound states of greater phenomenological interest, might therefore nd an appropriate

mathematical description within the framework of self-adjoint extensions of symmetric

operators. it remains to be seen how much freedom is left, on physical ground, to specify

the boundary conditions for the self-adjoint extension.

(iv) on considering the eect of the anomalous magnetic moment, eq. (2.10) is replaced

by eq. (5.4), with the potential term dened in (5.5). for all potentials diverging at the
origin, the eect of the anomalous magnetic moment is then dominating as r  0.

indeed, as far as the dirac operator is concerned, one can prove its essential self-

0 (cid:16)r3  {0}(cid:17) in the presence of a coulomb potential provided that ||

3, as is shown in [16], following work by weidmann (see
in our paper, however, we have focused on

adjointness on c

(see (4.11)) is majorized by 1
2

page 130 in [16] and references therein).

second-order dierential operators, and the consideration of a central potential, with the

associated hilbert space

l2(r+, r2dr)  l2(s2, d)

has eventually led to the second-order operators occurring in (2.10) and (2.17) and acting

on square-integrable functions on the positive half-line. our calculations, summarized in

the points (i)(iv) above, remain therefore original. we should notice that the condition
|| < 1
in other words, the condition on  ensuring essential self-adjointness of the dirac operator

3 found in [16] is compatible with our inequalities (4.14) and (4.15) for all l  2.

2

leads also to essential self-adjointness of the second-order operators studied in our paper,

whereas the converse does not hold (one may nd a || smaller than 3 but greater
3). our analysis has possibly the merit of having shown that some extra care is
necessary when l = 0, 1, but this should not be unexpected, if one bears in mind from

than 1
2

section 3 that already in the free case the values l = 0, 1 make it necessary to perform a

separate analysis (cf [20]).

19

we should also acknowledge that in [21] the essential self-adjointness of powers of

the dirac operator had been proved, but in cases when the potential v is smooth.

in

particular, when the potential is a c function on r3, no growth conditions on it are

necessary to ensure essential self-adjointness of any power of the dirac operator [9, 21].

in our problem, however, we have considered a coulomb term in the potential, which is

singular at the origin. although a regular solution of the eigenvalue problem exists [8, 18],

since the origin remains a fuchsian singular point, the domain of essential self-adjointness

of the second-order operators in the interacting case is changed. this is reected by the

inequality (4.13) for the fulllment of the limit-point condition at zero, which now involves

, and hence the atomic number [11, 12]. note also that, to nd a real-valued solution

which is regular at the origin in a coulomb eld, one only needs the weaker condition
k2  2 [11, 12]. thus, a careful investigation of the essential self-adjointness issue picks
out a subset of the general set of real-valued regular solutions.

for simplicity, we have considered in the end of section 4 only one linear term.

more precisely, however, two linear terms are often studied, of scalar and vector nature,

respectively [8]. moreover, a naturally occurring question is whether one can extend our

qualitative analysis to study the (essential) self-adjointness issue for operators involving

the square root of the laplacian [22], i.e. qc2h2  +m2

0c4  ze2

r . such problems have

been the object of intensive investigations, but more work could be done from the point

of view of rigorous mathematical foundations. in the light of the above remarks, there is

some encouraging evidence that new insight into the choice of phenomenological central

potentials can be gained by applying some powerful analytic techniques along the lines

described in our paper. in the near future, one might therefore hope to re-interpret from

a deeper perspective the previous work in the literature, including the class of potentials

responsible for quark connement.
