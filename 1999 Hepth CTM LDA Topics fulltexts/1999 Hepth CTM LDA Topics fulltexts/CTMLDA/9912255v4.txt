abstract

we argue that orientable open string theory without gso projection has n=2 space-

time supersymmetry in a spontaneously broken phase. the arguments are presented both

in neveu-schwarz-ramond and green-schwarz formulations. the formal but explicit

supersymmetry transformation law for string eld is given in the framework of wittens

open string eld theory. our results support a fundamental assumption which lies behind

the topological construction of stable d-branes starting from the unstable systems of

d9-branes.

introduction

one of the crucial observations in the development of superstring theory has been the

discovery of the so-called gso projection [1] for realizing the space-time supersymmetry.

the gso projection plays dual roles in superstring theory: it eliminates tachyons and

simultaneously makes the number of space-time bosonic and fermionic physical excitations

equal at each mass level. in the most recent developments of string theory associated with

various string dualities and d-branes, the space-time supersymmetry and gso projection

are playing indispensable roles. for example, the bps property of d-branes is a direct

consequence of the gso projection.

on the other hand, from the early days of string theory, the condensation of tachyon

in the theories without gso projection has been among several fundamental dynamical

questions which have long been resisting our exploration. recently, in connection with

the problem of constructing stable d-branes in unstable d-brane systems, interests on the

tachyon condensation [2] have been revived. the general topological characterization of d-

branes has been given based on the k-theoretical interpretation [3][4] of unstable d-brane

systems. the systems of unstable d-branes are realized as various open string theories

with mixed (namely, combined ordinary and opposite) gso projections or without the

projection at all. undoubtedly, formulating the dynamics of such systems must be among

future cornerstones for the development of non-perturbative string/m theory towards the

ultimate unied theory.

a simple and fundamental example among systems without supersymmetry is unstable

d9-branes [4] in type iia theory. this system, in a low energy approximation, may be

approximated by 10 dimensional yang-mills theory coupled with tachyon and with vector-

like majorana fermions. if the stable d-branes are to be realized as topological excitations

with bps property resulting from the condensation of tachyon, the system should have

a hidden supersymmetry, perhaps as a nonlinear realization, in a spontaneously broken

phase. this is a basic assumption behind recent descriptions of unstable d-brane systems

using tachyons. for example, approaches to world-volume actions [5] for unstable d-

branes and the condensation of tachyon [6] have been proposed along this line. however,

no concrete evidence justifying this assumption from the viewpoint of the dynamics of

2

open strings has been given. the purpose of the present work is to ll this gap by providing

some positive arguments in support of this conjecture. since any possible models for
the dynamics of such systems already contain the string length parameter s =  as
the inverse tachyon mass, any local-eld theory approximation cannot be regarded as a

systematic way of dealing with the problem except for discussing certain long-distance

behaviors. in general, we have to take into account all mass levels from the outset.

after presenting some elementary arguments for spontaneously broken symmetries of

string theory in next two sections, we investigate in section 4 the case of space-time super-

symmetry rst in the nsr formalism. then we argue that the same results are obtained

in the green-schwarz formalism as well. in section 5, we proceed to investigate the formal

supersymmetry transformation law in the framework of wittens open superstring eld

theory. we conclude in section 6 by making some remarks. we will also briey discuss

how the linear supersymmery could be recovered in certain nonperturbative vacua.

2. evidence for spontaneously broken space-time supersymmetry

let us start from collecting some pieces of qualitative evidence for the existence of space-

time supersymmetry without the gso projection in order to motivate our discussions

in later sections. since, without the projection, the number of physical particle degrees

of freedom are not equal between fermions and bosons at xed mass level, we naturally

expect that the tachyonic vacuum must break supersymmetry spontaneously even if su-

persymmetry is actually a symmetry of the theory. is there any evidence for this? first

of all, there must exist goldstone fermions. since the ramond sector indeed contains

massless fermions as ground state, this is possible. let us rst briey study the coupling

of tachyon with massless fermions to get some avor on how such an interpretation should

look like.

without the gso projection, the massless fermions appear as a pair of opposite chi-
ralities. let them be  (11 = ), and tachyon be t . then the eld equation for
fermions are of the form

   = gt  + o(t 2) +   

(2.1)

where we have suppressed the coupling with the massless gauge elds. the natural can-

3

didate for the supercurrent is

s
   + ag(t ) + bgt  + o(g2t 2) +    .

(2.2)

note that we have taken into account the conservation of g-parity in neveu-schwarz-

ramond open string theory in writing down these expressions, and a, b are constants to

be determined. g is the coupling constant of open strings. the usual string coupling of

closed strings gs is proportional to the square of g. the rst term which is linear in the

massless fermions is the signature of goldstone fermions and of the nonlinear realization

of supersymmetry. taking the divergence of the would-be supercurrent leads to

  s =     + ag(cid:16)2t  + (t )(cid:17) + bg(cid:16)(t ) + t 2(cid:17) +    .

(2.3)

now using the tachyon equation of motion

2t = 

1
 t + o(g2t 3) +   

(2.4)

together with the fermion equation of motion, we nd that the choice a =  = b leads
to the conservation of the supercurrent up to the order o(t 2)

  s = o(g2t 2) +   

(2.5)

by requiring that the fermion equation is consistent with the conservation of supercurrent
to the next order o(g2t 2), we nd that the order o(g2t 2) term in the fermion equation

and the current are

(1 + 2c)g2(t t ), cg2t 2

(2.6)

respectively, where c is an undetermined constant. of course, we have to include the

gauge elds and all the higher excitations to achieve a really consistent construction.

however, this argument serves as a guide on what we should expect. for example, the
result (2.6) suggests that the condensation of tachyon such that g2ct 2 = 1/ recovers

the linear supersymmetry by eliminating the inhomogeneous term (and hence also the

original kinetic terms of them in the action) in the supercurrent.

the existence of spontaneously broken supersymmetry when all massive levels are

taken into account is suggested by the following observation, which, to the authors knowl-

edge, has never been mentioned in the literature although it is implicitly contained in a

4

familiar formula. for a wide class of local eld theory models with supersymmetry, it is

well known that the tree-level mass levels after the spontaneous breakdown of supersym-
metry satisfy the trace formula [7] for the mass square operator m 2 ((1)f = 1 or1 for
bosons and fermions, respectively)

tr(cid:16)(1)f m 2(cid:17) = 0

(2.7)

where the trace tr() is taken over all physical one-particle states. this of course re-
duces to tr((1)f ) = 0, the trace tr now being taken at each xed mass level, if the
supersymmetry is realized linearly without spontaneous breaking.

let us check whether similar relations among dierent mass levels are valid in open

string theory with tachyon. in string theory containing states of innitely large masses,

it is natural to dene regularized traces corresponding to this quantity by

an  lim

 0

tr(cid:16)(1)f m 2ne m 2(cid:17) = (1)n lim

 0

dn
d n z( ),

in open nsr string theory, we have

z( ) = tr(cid:16)(1)f e m 2(cid:17).

z( ) = trn s(cid:16)q2nns 1(cid:17)  trr(cid:16)q2nr(cid:17)

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

where q = e /2 and nn s, nr are the level operators for the ns sector and r sector,

respectively.

(2.11)

(2.12)

note that there is no gso projection in taking trace in (2.10) and we have suppressed the

transverse spatial indices for the creation-annihilation operators. since the gso projected

pieces in this trace cancel between the ns and r sector owing to the well-known jacobis

abstrusa identity, it is sucient to retain only the contribution from the oppositely

projected pieces. we then have

the + sign in front of the second term in this expression indicates the opposite gso
projection. because of this, a negative power term q1 is not canceled, corresponding to
the existence of tachyon in the ns sector. to study the short time behavior   0, we
perform jacobi transformation q = e  q = e/ ( =  /2) using theta function
identities, and obtain

z( ) =

(2.14)

(2.15)

the asymptotic behavior in the short time limit   0 is

z( ) 

4

2 (cid:16)16 + 16 + (256 + 256)e2/ + o(e4/)(cid:17).

if the ordinary gso projection were used, we would instead have 16  16, 256 256, and
so on, in this expression. as is well known [8], the 16 + 16-contribution corresponds to

the massless ns-ns + r-r elds in the closed-string channel. if we sum over the gso

projected and oppositely projected parts, only the states in the ns-ns sector remain,

showing that there is no r-r charges exchanged in the t-channel.

now the above formula clearly shows that

an = 0,

(n 6= 4).

(2.16)

thus the graded (regularized) traces over all mass levels are almost all zero except for

n = 4 in nsr open string theory. this should be regarded as a generalization of the

mass formula (2.7) for spontaneously broken supersymmetry in local eld theory to open

superstring theory with the tachyonic vacuum. the fact that ans vanish for arbitrary

large n suggests that the possible nonlinear supersymmetry could only be realized when

all mass levels are taken into account.

we note that the result (2.16) is essentially a direct consequence of the s-channel-t-

channel duality and that, in the closed-string (t) channel, the ordinary gso projection is

automatic if we include both ns and r sectors in the open string (s) channel. thus there

is no problem of nonlocality on the world sheet even if we do not make the gso projection

in the open-string channel. otherwise, we could not have assumed the unprojected (or

6

oppositely projected) open string theories consistently as describing the unstable d-branes

in superstring theory.

3. nonlinear symmetries in string theory

before proceeding to further discussions on spontaneously broken supersymmetry, let

us here recall how the nonlinear symmetry transformations and associated spontaneous

symmetry breaking can be realized in string theory in its general world-sheet formulation.

in the present paper, for brevity of terminology, we call any symmetry transformation

with inhomogeneous term nonlinear symmetry. the ordinary gauge transformation and

also the general coordinate transformation are typical examples for this phenomena.

one of the characteristic features of space-time symmetries exhibited in physical scat-

tering amplitudes of string theory is that they are always associated with the correspond-

ing currents on the world sheet. take as an instructive example the gauge transformation

of an open string state for which the massless vector state just plays the role of gauge eld.

in the world-sheet picture, this corresponds to the existence of the following world-sheet

current

ja
()  abb(x()),

(3.1)

where we have only considered the bosonic part for simplicity and (x) is an arbitrary
massless external scalar eld. (0, 1) = (, ) are the world-sheet coordinates (0   
). here and in what follows the vector indices a, b, . . . correspond to world sheet and

those , , . . . to target space-time. all world-sheet local operators should be understood

as normal-order products. to make the following manipulations well-dened after the

normal ordering we have to impose the usual on-shell conditions. now it is obvious
that although the current is conserved locally aja

a = 0 on the world sheet, the charge

q = r dj0

 is not conserved for neumann open strings.

dq( )

d

= p(, )(x(, ))(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

=

=0

(3.2)

where p = 1

 0x is the canonical momentum on the world sheet (our unit is  = 1/2).
note that the violation of charge conservation is proportional to the vertex operator for

7

the massless vector state.

if some of the directions obey the dirichlet condition, the

violation of charge conservation only comes from neumann directions. on the other

hand, the charge itself is given as

q( ) = (x())(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

.

(3.3)

=

=0

namely, the charge generates the phase gauge transformation of the string wave function

( )  eiq( )( ) = ei((x(,0))(x(,)))( ).

(3.4)

the equation (3.2) shows that we have to make a shift of the on-shell external gauge eld
(2a = 0, a = 0) corresponding to the massless vector excitations

a(x) = (x),

(3.5)

in order to compensate the violation of the conservation law at the string boundaries.

this trivial example tells us that in string theory in general we cannot exclude the

violation of symmetry occurring at the string boundary, provided that the violation is

proportional to physical vertex operators and hence is compensated by the insertion of

the vertex operators. actually, to include the symmetry associated with the closed-string

states, this must be further generalized to the situation [10] where the current is not

conserved even locally on the world sheet, but the violation is proportional to vertex

operators of closed strings. the general coordinate symmetry and gauge transformation

corresponding to the antisymmetric ns-ns tensor belong to this latter class. the currents

corresponding to them are

and

ta = v(x)ax

ba = abu(x)bx,

(3.6)

(3.7)

respectively, where u, v are arbitrary on-shell divergenceless-and-massless vector elds.

their divergences, by the world-sheet equation of motion, are

at a =

1
2

(v + v)axax,

(3.8)

 note that in the covariant operator language, the violation of charge conservation is measured by the
commutator with the virasoro (or brst) operators. to the present authors knowledge, the derivation
of nonlinear gauge and space-time symmetries in string theory from this point of view was rst discussed
in ref. [9].

8

aba =

1
2

(v  v)abaxbx.

(3.9)

since the divergences are proportional to the on-shell gauge transformation

h = v + v,

b = v  v

of the graviton and ns-ns antisymmetric tensor and hence are compensated by the

on-shell gauge transformation of these elds, the above currents give the symmetry of

string theory.

indeed the charges are nothing but the generator of general coordinate

(in the sense of target space-time) and string-shape dependent phase transformations

(|i  exp ir db(x())x()|i), respectively. we also remark that in the case of

open strings the current corresponding to general coordinate transformation has no extra

violation at neumann boundaries, while the conservation of the ns-ns antisymmetric

tensor-gauge charge is violated at neumann boundaries. it is a common knowledge that

the latter violation is compensated by the shift of the vector gauge eld a = u

which couples at the boundary. this is the origin of a now familiar relationship between

dirac-born-infeld action and the non-commutative yang-mills theory [11].

the reason why we come to this seemingly self-evident digression is that these exam-

ples contain the case of the symmetries which are spontaneously broken in the ordinary

perturbative vacua. take the rst example for deniteness.
if we consider the gauge
function (x) = cx which is linear in the coordinate, the gauge transformation of the
gauge eld is nothing but the constant shift of the eld

a = c,

(3.10)

which is spontaneously broken in perturbative vacua. it is well known that the massless

gauge bosons, including photon and graviton, on the perturbative vacuum can be regarded

as the goldstone bosons associated with this phenomena. one important remark here

is that since the constant vector c is not constrained, all components of the constant

vector is in a sense physical. thus at vanishing momentum the number of physical states

are increased. this is nothing but the phenomenon of discrete physical states and is

the signature of the existence of spontaneously broken symmetries associated with local

space-time symmetries. remember that the gauge transformations with gauge functions

9

that do not vanish at innity can in general be spontaneously broken. almost the same

apply to the cases of constant metric and constant antisymmetric eld b. in the former,

the transformation is a general gl(10, r) coordinate transformation, while in the latter
the transformation corresponds to a linear vector gauge function b = bx and a linear
shift of vector gauge eld a = bx.

4. nonlinear supersymmetry in nsr and gs open string theories

we now study the space-time supersymmetry in light of the above observations. our

goal is to show that the massless fermion states of open string theory can be regarded as

the goldstone fermions associated with the spontaneously broken supersymmetry in the

tachyonic vacua.

4.1 the nsr formalism

in the nsr formalism, the charge corresponding to space-time supersymmetry is the

integral of fermion emission vertex at zero-momentum. using the standard result of [12],

it is

q = i dz

2i

v f
 ,

v f
 (z) = lim
k0

s(z)e(z)/2eikx(z),

(4.1)

(4.2)

where we are using the 1/2 picture and  of the world-sheet spin operator s is the
32 components so(10) space-time spinor index. the scalar eld (z) corresponds to the
standard bosonized representation of the superghosts (, ) = (e, e). in the open-
string notation, the components of the world-sheet current sa(, ) corresponding to the

supercharge (4.1) (q = r 

0 ds0

) is

s0
(, ) =

s1
(, ) =

1
2

1
2

(se(  ) + se( + )),

(se(  )  se( + )).

(4.3)

(4.4)

here we have formally shifted to the convention of the world-sheet minkowski metric for

comparison with the convention of the previous section. however, in considering the ope

on the world-sheet, we always assume the euclidean convention.

10

the usual argument [12] for the gso projection comes from the multi-valuedness of

the spin operator. namely, the operator product expansion with the world-sheet neveu-
schwarz eld (z) is

(z)s(w)  (z  w)1/2s(w) +    , etc.

(4.5)

in closed-string theory, this forces us to project out the states with odd g-parity in the

ns sector, and simultaneously the half of states classied by the generalized chirality

operator in the r-sector as required by the operator product (4.5), in order to ensure the

integrability of the fermion-emission vertex operators on the riemann surface. as is well

known, after including the ghost contributions, the g-parity and the generalized chirality

operators which we call fermionic g-parity, are given, in terms of the oscillators, by

g = (1)p
 = 11(1)p

r=1/2(drdr+rrrr),

n=1 dndn+nnnn+00.

(4.6)

(4.7)

in open string theory, however, the projection is not completely mandatory since the

open string vertex operators are inserted only at the boundary of world sheets. the on-

shell closed string states which appear by the factorization of the world-sheet riemann

surface with such vertex operators for open string states inserted at the boundaries are

automatically gso projected, provided we include both ns and r states, as exemplied

by the partition function treated in section 2. there appear no tachyonic states in closed-

string channel.

now if we include the oppositely gso-projected states in open-string theory, the

world-sheet supercharge can still formally be dened by

q( ) = z 

0

d s0

(, ),

(4.8)

by choosing a particular riemann sheet. then, the charge is not in general conserved,

but the current is conserved locally on the world sheet and possible violation of charge

conservation comes only from the open-string boundaries.

dq( )

d

= z 

0

d 1s1

(, ) = se(  ) + se( + ).

(4.9)

11

the right hand side does not vanish in general since the operator se can be double-
valued. in that case, se(  ) se( + )  2se(  ) which is itself propor-
tional to fermion emission vertex at the string end point ( = ) with zero momentum.

the cases where double-valuedness occurs can be classied in two classes: first, when the

supercurrent acts on bosonic states (ns sector), the double-valuedness occurs if and only

if the states are oppositely gso projected, independently on the fermionic g-parity  of

the supercurrent. secondly, when the supercurrent acts on fermionic states (r-sector), it

occurs if and only if the fermionic g-parities of the supercurrent and that of the states

are mutually opposite.

in the rst case, the fermionic g-parity of the states obtained

after the action of the supercurrent is opposite to that of the supercurrent, whereas in the

second case the bosonic states are always oppositely projected. this means that these

two cases are consistent. namely, both corresponds to 3-point vertices with 2 fermions

and 1 boson in which the fermionic g-parities of two fermion lines are ipped with the

emission of one odd g-parity boson.

the violation of supercharge conservation, being compensated by the condensation of

constant massless fermion states, can be interpreted in the same way as in the case of

the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry corresponding to the constant shift of

the vector gauge elds. thus, the supersymmetry is broken spontaneously. in terms of

oscillator modes, the supersymmetry transformation mixes all mass levels and cannot in

general be truncated into multiplets of nite dimensions. the reason is that the natural

moding of the supercurrent density for double valued states are half-integer expansion.

but the supercharge is still dened by the integral (4.8) with no half-integer exponential

factor. if we try to represent the symmetry transformation in terms of massless excitations

by eliminating all the massive levels, the symmetry transformation is literally nonlinearly

realized.

we also note that at zero-momentum there is no dirac equation for the wave functions

which are contracted with the spinor index of the supercurrent. hence, the number of

degrees for the constant shift of the massless fermion elds is doubled, comparing with the

on-shell physical states obtained as the zero-momentum limit of the massless fermions with
non-zero momentum: 8 + 8  16 + 16. the corresponding goldstone fermions are just the
vector-like massless fermion with both chiralities. in conclusion, there exists a nonlinearly

12

realized n = 2 (iia-type) space-time supersymmetry in 10 space-time dimensions.

4.2 the gs formalism

we next study how the above situation is described in the green-schwarz formalism,

since it is usually more suitable for realizing the space-time supersymmetry. in order to

do this, it is useful to rst reconsider the partition function which we have discussed in

section 2. jacobis identity leads to the following identity for the partition function of the

oppositely projected states.

what is the interpretation of the right hand side? the answer is that the expression is

nothing but the partition function for the gs open string theory with the wrong bound-

ary condition, which violates the manifest (i.e. linear) space-time supersymmetry but is

a perfectly valid condition from the viewpoint of the pure world-sheet eld theory. indeed
the prefactor q1 corresponds to the casimir energy that is not cancelled between bosons

and fermions because of the half-integer moding of the spinor coordinates forced by the

wrong (namely, anti-periodic) boundary condition. the innite product factor in the

numerator is nothing but the contribution from the excitation modes of the spinor coor-

dinates, with the minus sign being the space-time fermion grading. note that there is no

zero modes for the spinor coordinates, due to the anti-periodic boundary condition. the

conservation of the world-sheet current corresponding to the space-time supersymmetry

is only violated at the open-string boundaries, so that we can again interpret this as an

indication of the spontaneously broken supersymmetry.

let us discuss more details. unfortunately, in the gs formalism, the quantization

is only practicable in the light-cone gauge . because of this, the following discussion is

somewhat limited, but it provides reasonable evidence that the same results as in the nsr

formalism are valid in the gs formalism. for some aspects, the latter is more transparent

in treating the ns and r sectors on equal footing.

let us briey recapitulate the ordinary formulation of the light-cone gs string [13][15].

13

we will mostly follow the convention of [15]. the light-cone gauge action is

alightcone = z d d(cid:16) 

1
2

ax iax i +

i
4

saas(cid:17)

(4.11)

here space-time vector index i runs only over the transverse directions, and s denotes

two majorana-weyl space-time spinors as fermion elds on the world sheet satisfying the

light-cone gauge condition,

+s = 0.

(4.12)

the two-component index n of sn with respect to world-sheet, being acted upon by the
two-dimensional dirac matrices (0, 1), is behaving as a two-dimensional spinor because

of the gauge xing of the local  symmetry of the covariant action [14] and hence s =
s00. the (space-time) supersymmetry transformation is

x i = (p+)1/2is,
s = i(p+)1/2  x .

(4.13)

(4.14)

in the transformation of the spinor s, x  does not appear and 0x + = p+, due to

the light-cone gauge conditions. the world-sheet supercurrents corresponding to this

transformation is

sa
 = (  x )as.

(4.15)

note that the currents do not satisfy the light-cone condition (4.12).

we have to impose the boundary condition that identies the two (world-sheet) com-

ponents of the eld s in order to ensure the world-sheet energy-momentum conservation at

the boundary. the usual condition which keeps the space-time supersymmetry manifestly

is

s1(, 0) = s2(, 0), s1(, ) = s2(, ).

(4.16)

thus the number of independent components of spinor coordinates are 8 which belongs to

the irreducible spinor representation 8s of so(8) and are represented by a single periodic
holomorphic spinor coordinate eld sa(  ) = sa(   + 2) dened as

sa() = s1(, ) for 0    , sa() = s2(, 2) for     2. (4.17)

14

we denote the so(8) spinor indices corresponding to representations (8s, 8c) by (a, a).
note that an so(10) chiral spinor with 16 components now consists of a direct sum of
two irreducible spinor representations 8s + 8c, namely,   (a, a), of which 8c ( a) are
dependent components. similarly, an opposite chirality (in the sense of 10 dimensions)
spinor consists of the representations 8c + 8s,   ( a, a) with 8s  a being now the
on-shell dependent components with non-zero momentum.

the independent world-sheet supercharges corresponding to the above supersymmetry

transformation are then

qa( ) = (2p+)1/2z 
q a( ) = (p+)1/2i

d(sa(  ) + sa( + )),

(4.19)

where pi(  ) is the usual transverse orbital momentum operator with mode expan-
sion pi(  ) = pn nein( ), again momentarily returning to world-sheet minkowski

the supersymmetry charges are conserved since the spinor coordinates sa(  ) are
periodic. the spectrum of this theory precisely reproduces that of the gso projected

states of nsr open strings. there exists a 10 dimensional space-time symmetry (n = 1)

with 16 supercharges.

we now consider what happens if the boundary condition is replaced by another

possibility, instead of (4.16),

s1(, 0) = s2(, 0), s1(, ) = s2(, ).

in this case, the spinor coordinates dened again by (4.17) are anti-periodic sa(, +2) =

which leads to the partition function (with fermion grading) (4.10) and hence exactly

matches with the spectrum of the oppositely gso projected states, as already discussed

in the beginning of this subsection. here we have used the standard notation: the modes

of the antiperiodic spinor coordinates labeled by half integers are sra. the uncanceled
zero-point energy 1/2 can be derived either from lorentz invariance or the standard
rule from the zeta-function regularization. thus, the ground state is the scalar tachyon.
the rst excited states are ua(k)s1/2a|0i which are massless fermion states k2 = 0.
the subscript  indicates that the fermion state should be interpreted as the  chirality
state with respect to so(9,1), in contrast to the massless fermion states in the usual gs

string which have + chirality. the space-time handedness of the massless fermion states

can be interpreted to be opposite to those appeared in the case of periodic boundary

condition. this is due to the fact that the massless fermion states now come from the

non-zero modes of the spinor coordinates. if the massless vector states of the ordinary gs
open string is denoted by |ii, the massless fermion states of the ordinary gso projection,
which come from the spinor zero modes of the periodic spinor coordinates and belong to

a a, as u a+i

the same super multiplet as the massless vector states, are given, using the so(8) dirac
matrices i
a as0a|ii where s0a are the zero-mode of the spinor coordinates.
the dependent components of the spinor wave function ua+ with nonzero momentum
a akiu a/k+. from the 10 dimensional
are given by the dirac equation as ua+ = i
viewpoint, the wave functions ua(k) as independent components of the spinor wave
function have the opposite chiralities to u a+(k) of even fermionic state. thus we can
now make a consistent interpretation that the usual gs string spectrum with periodic

boundary condition and the new gs string spectrum with antiperiodic boundary condition

corresponds to ordinarily and to oppositely gso projected sectors, respectively, in the

nsr formalism.

the conservation of supercharges is violated at the open-string boundary  =  for

the right hand side of these equations, however, coincide with the zero-momentum limit

of the fermion emission vertices of gs open string theory, just the same phenomena as

in the nsr formalism. note that the world-sheet conformal dimensions of these vertex

operator are not equal to one. this is allowed in light-cone gauge, since we have already

chosen a preferred conformal frame. in the covariant notation, the vertex operators at
zero-momentum appearing in the right-hand side would be p(z)
(z) (apart from
the overall normalization factor sa/p+  ) which has the correct transformation

property as the source of a space-time massless spinor eld, since the spinor coordinate is

a world-sheet scalar before -gauge xing. since the fermion emitted by these vertices are

the zero-momentum limit of the massless fermion state with the ordinary gso projection

(even fermionic g-parity), the form of the vertices coincides with that of the ordinary gs

strings. the g-parity of the states does not change with the insertion of the corresponding

vertices.

the next question is then how to describe the emission of states appeared in the

opposite gs string, namely, the open string states with odd (both bosons and fermions)

g-parity. it is clear that the corresponding vertices have to interchange the states between

periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions for spinor coordinates sa(, ). in the case

of the nsr formalism, the change of boundary condition was required to describe the

emission of space-time fermions. for the emission of the oppositely gso projected states,

the boundary condition was preserved. the situation in the gs formalism is thus just

reversed: the change of the boundary condition is necessary for describing the emission

of odd g-parity states, not for the reason of the emission of space-time fermions. to

achieve this, we have to introduce an operator which ips the boundary condition of the

spinor coordinate, an analogue of the spin operator in the nsr formalism which changes

the boundary condition of the vector neveu-schwarz coordinate. in contrast to the spin

operator, it is basically a space-time boson, which we call the the vector operator, since

it necessarily transforms as a space-time vector.

17

as is well known, the triality symmetry of the so(8) group makes possible to es-

tablish a direct relation between the spinor and the vector representations through the

bosonization of the spinor coordinate. this is achieved by introducing 4 scalar coordinate
1, . . . , 4 with the correlator hi(z)j(w)i = ij ln(z  w). the eight components of the
spinor coordinates are given as

{sa} = {ei 1

2 (1234)},

(4.28)

where the number of minus sign is even. then the transverse vector operator i (i =
1, . . . , 8) can be dened by

2i1 = s 1

2

(eii + eii), 2i = is 1

2

(eii  eii).

(4.29)

we have used the same symbol i for the vector operator as the neveu-schwarz coor-

dinates in the nsr formalism, since they can indeed be identied. conversely, the spin

operator in the light-cone gauge nsr formalism can be identied with the spinor coordi-

nate of the gs formalism. note that both of the spinor coordinate and the vector operator

have conformal dimension 1/2. it is convenient to introduce also the spinor coordinates

s a in the 8c representation by

{s a} = {ei 1

2 (1234)},

(4.30)

where the number of minus sign is now odd. then by choosing the appropriate linear basis

for the components of the spinor coordinates such that sa are self-conjugate, analogously

as that for the vector operator (4.29), the singular parts of the opes are given as

a as a(w),

a bi(w),

1
2

i(z)sa(w)  (z  w)1/2i
(z  w)1/2i
sa(z)s b(w) 
sa(z)sb(w)  (z  w)1ab,
s a(z)s b(w)  (z  w)1 a b,
i(z)j(w)  (z  w)1ij,

(4.31)

etc.

 see e. g. the chapter 5 of [15].
here and in what follows we suppress the cocyle factors.

18

these opes show that the vector operator i indeed changes the boundary condition

of the spinor coordinates between periodic and anti-periodic.

it should also be noted

that with the insertion of the vector operator the spinor coordinate sa eectively behave

as s a which has the opposite chirality and hence directly couples with the independent
component ua of the massless fermion state of odd fermionic g-parity.

we can now write down the vertex operators which describe the emission of the odd

g-parity states from open gs strings, to be inserted at the string end points. for example
the tachyon vertex operator is kii eikixi, assuming that the momentum is in the transverse
direction. the fermion emission vertex operators for odd fermionic g-parity are obtained

by interchanging the role of the original spinor coordinate sa by s a in the vertex operators
for the ordinary gs string theory. in particular, their zero-momentum limits are s a and
i
a bpis b(z). thus the corresponding supercharges and currents are

q a( ) = (2p+)1/2z 

0
qa( ) = (p+)1/2i

d(pi(  )s a(  ) + pi( + )s a( + ))

a( ) = (2p+)1/2(s a(  ) + s a( + )),

a( ) = (p+)1/2i

a a(pi(  )s a(  ) + pi( + )s a( + )),
a a(pi(  )s a(  )  pi( + )s a( + )).

(4.32)

(4.33)

(4.34)

(4.35)

(4.36)

(4.37)

the spinor coordinate s a is antiperiodic if and only if it acts either on the fermionic states
of even g-parity (namely, the usual gs string) or on the bosonic states of odd g-parity,

as exhibited in the opes. these properties are identical with the results in the nsr
formalism. thus we can interpret the 32-components supercharges (qa, q a, q a, qa) of
the extended gs formalism as the light-cone version of the n = 2 (iia) supercharge q

of the covariant nsr formalism.

5. supersymmetry transformation law for string elds

the foregoing arguments provide a strong support for the existence of nonlinear n = 2

space-time symmetry in open superstring theory without the gso projection. however, it

19

is based on the standard world-sheet picture which is only rst quantized. as an attempt

toward a non-perturbative formulation, let us now turn to the discussion of space-time

supersymmetry in the framework of string eld theory. although string-eld theories are

problematic with respect to the question whether they really provide a well-dened theory

for nonperturbative physics in general, we can at least formally check that the mechanism

found in the world-sheet picture leads to the correct behaviors for general multi-body

states.

a natural starting point in this direction is wittens open string eld theory [16][17].

the action for the string eld a = (a, ) where a and  are string elds for ns and r

sector, respectively, can be expressed, using the original notation of ref. [17], as

s =

1

2 z (a  qba +   y qb +

2
3

a  x(a  a) + 2  a  ).

(5.1)

the qb is the brst operator of the nsr open strings. the ghost number of the string
elds is gh(a, ) = (1/2, 0). the star product  is a half-sewing operation of strings,
which has ghost number 3/21 = 1/2. the integralr is a self-sewing operation with ghost
number 3/2 + 1 = 1/2. the brst operator acts on the star products of the string
elds as a graded derivation operator. the operators x and y are the picture changing

and inverse picture changing operators, respectively, satisfying xy = y x = 1, inserted
at the string midpoint  = /2. their ghost numbers are 1 and 1, respectively. if we
bosonize the ghost elds appropriately, we can easily write down concrete expressions as

the operators on string elds. the peculiar ghost numbers assigned to the denitions of the

product and integral, explained by the ghost current anomaly, are just necessary to cancel

the midpoint anomalies of the vertices against brst and reparametrization symmetries,

as demonstrated explicitly using the oscillator representations in several works [18]. the

gauge transformation is dened to be

a = qb + x(a      a) +       
 = qb + x(a      a) + x(      )

(5.2)

(5.3)

note that the gauge parameter elds  = (, ) have ghost number (3/2,1). following
witten, it is convenient to introduce the following symbolic notation,

s =

1

2 i (a  qba +

2
3

a  a  a),

20

(5.4)

for establishing gauge symmetry, the cyclic symmetry property of the integral of the

a = qba + a      a.

(5.5)

 products is essential

i a  b = (1)|a||b|i b  a,

(5.6)

where (1)|a| = 1 is the grading of the string elds which is dened by combining the
space-time boson-fermion grading and the world-sheet grading. thus it is necessary that

all the string elds have denite gradings. in the case of bosonic string, we dene the
string elds with ghost number 1/2 are of odd grading |a| = 1. the odd grading is
chosen to ensure the existence of the kinetic term : since the brst operator is odd,

the cyclic symmetry of the integral leads to h a  qba = h (qba)  a which must be
consistent with 0 = h qb(a  a) = h ((qba)  a + (1)|a|a  qba) corresponding to
the derivation property of the brst operator. this requires that the string eld a has
odd grading. then, all the string elds of ghost number 2n  1/2 have odd grading and
those with ghost number 2n + 1/2 have even grading. for example, the gauge parameter
with ghost number 3/2 is even, and hence gauge invariance follows. we note that the
integral is nonvanishing only if the total grading of the integrand is odd. thus in the
cyclic symmetry property (5.6), (1)|a||b| = 1.

for the nsr strings, we again require that both the ns and r elds have odd grad-

ing for the existence of the kinetic term. thus the gauge parameters ,  are even. in

other words, since the coecient elds for them are respectively space-time bosons and

fermions, this amounts to requiring that the world-sheet states have opposite but de-

nite world-sheet gradings, odd and even, respectively. then, for the ns elds with xed
total ghost number 1/2 we have to impose that (1)n+n have always the same
sign for the excitations of the world sheet spinor eld (, ) and the superghost elds

(, ), (, ). for the r elds with ghost number 0 and whose world-sheet grading
is dened by (1)n 
 is the number operator of the world-sheet spinor ex-
cluding the zero-mode, we have to require that (1)n 
n 11 has the same sign for all
the components. these conditions are satised if we make the ordinary gso projection
(1)n+n = 1 and (1)n 

n 11 = 1, for the ns and r elds respectively.

this is the standard formulation of the open superstring eld theory. actually, there

 11 where n 

21

is a potential problem in these formal arguments. namely, the mid-point insertion of
picture changing operator causes a problem in proving the gauge invariance to order g2,

since the product of x at the same world-sheet position is singular. for the moment, we

neglect this problem and try to extend the construction to include the string elds with

opposite gso projection.

let us denote the string eld with the ordinary gso projection by (a+, +) and those

with the opposite projection by (a, ), respectively. the above discussion shows an

immediate diculty in including the elds with odd g-parity. namely, they obviously

have opposite relative gradings compared with the ordinary gso projection. thus the

requirement that the string elds must be of odd grading is no more satised, if the

vacuum for both case is common and hence is of the same (even) grading. in particular,

we cannot express the kinetic term for the odd g-parity elds in witten form. remember
however that the kinetic terms of the standard scalar product form ha|qb|ai exist for
both gradings, assuming appropriate reality condition. to express the action in witten

form, we are forced to assume that the fock vacuum on which we construct the odd

g-parity string elds in terms of oscillators have the opposite grading compared with the

ordinary projection with even g parity. since the string elds with dierent g-parity can

be regarded as being independent of each other, this can be done consistently if we take

into account the conservation of g-parity, by introducing a g-parity coordinates  which

is even and satises 2 = 1. the integration rule is rg 1 = 1,rg  = 0. we assign  to

odd g-parity string elds, such that only even number of odd g-parity elds can appear

in the action. grading of the string elds is always odd, irrespectively of g-parity in this

convention. also we can consistently set the fock vacuum obtained from the product of

two odd g-parity vacua is even. of course, the product of one odd and one even vacua is

odd.

we denote the extended integration operation using the same original notationr rg 
r . the extended integration is again nonvanishing only if the integrand is odd. using
this convention, the standard kinetic term is represented in the witten form r a  qba =
ha+|qb|a+i + h+|y qb|+i + ha|qb|a0i +h|y qb|i. thus we can unify the even
and odd g-parity elds and denote them as a = (a, ) = (a+ + a, + + ). which

is of grading odd as a whole. hence, the same form (5.1) or (5.4) for the action is valid,

22

with gauge transformation being extended to both g-parities by dening the extended

gauge parameter eld  = (+ + , + + ).

we can now proceed to investigate the space-time supersymmetry. the natural can-

didate for the supersymmetry generator is the zero-momentum fermion vertex operator

(4.1). wittens ansatz which has correct ghost number and grading is

a = q,

 = x(

1
2

)qa.

(5.7)

to show the invariance of the action under this transformation, we need that q satises

i qa = 0,

q(a  a) = (qa)  a + a  qa.

(5.8)

(5.9)

these are sucient for proving the invariance of the cubic interaction term. they are

indeed satised, as explicitly checked in the oscillator representation in ref.

[19] for the

case of ordinary gso projected formalism.

in our case with the oppositely projected

sectors, we have to take into account the g-parity coordinate  to ensure the correct
grading and g-parity properties in establishing (5.8) and (5.9). the super parameter ,
which of course is of odd grading, should also be decomposed as  = 
 where

 are the 10 dimensional weyl spinors with positive and negative fermionic g-parity,
respectively. since, apart from the grading, only essential requirement for the validity

+ + 

of these relations is that the supercharge is an integral along the strings of the current

operator which is not too singular with respect to the midpoint insertions. since the latter

property of the world-sheet supercurrent, being ensured by the conformal dimensions of

the operators, is not aected by the opposite projection, we can conclude that they are

satised with the existence of both projections as equally well as in the case of the ordinary

projection. thus the cubic terms alone have linear space-time supersymmetry.

to show the supersymmetry of the quadratic kinetic term, it is necessary to use the fact

that the supercharge is brst invariant in addition to the above properties. it is at this

point where a crucial dierence of our case from the theory with the ordinary projection

arises. the commutation relation of the fermion emission vertex and the brst operator

is a total derivative,

{qb, v f

 (z)} = z(c(z)v f

 (z)).

(5.10)

23

thus supercharge is brst invariant if and only if the fermion emission operator is single-

valued. if it is double-valued, we have, using the same convention for open string notations

( = 0) as in subsection 4.1,

[qb, q] = cv f

 () + cv f

 () = 2cv f

 ().

(5.11)

this is just the manifestation of the same phenomena which we have been discussing in

previous sections on the basis of the rst quantized world-sheet picture. in terms of string

eld theory, the insertion of fermion emission vertices must equivalently be described by

an appropriate shift of the string eld.

the variation of the quadratic term under the linear super transformation is

i a  qba = 2z   [qb, q]a.

(5.12)

the right-hand side is nonvanishing if and only if the ns string eld a is in the odd

g-parity sector and hence the fermionic g-parity of the r eld  is opposite to that of

the parameter of supersymmetry transformation. the result is of course identical with

world-sheet approach. here we have used the fact that the picture changing operators

satisfy xy (/2) = 1 and commutative with both brst operator and the supercharge.

the commutativity of the picture changing operator with the supercharge is valid even

if the fermion emission vertex is double-valued since it commutes with the ghost variable
[q, x] = [q,{qb, }] = {2cv f (), } = 0. this violation of brst invariance is

 :

canceled if we shift the fermionic string eld as

shif t = qqli,

(5.13)

where ql (and qr) is the half brst operator which is dened by integrating over the

left (right) half of the open string qb = qr + ql. also we have introduced the identity
string eld i as introduced in [20], which is characterized by

i  a = a  i = a,

a

(5.14)

and has ghost number 1/2, due to the midpoint insertion. note that the string eld
qli is odd. some other useful properties of these operators are

qbi = 0,
24

(5.15)

qi = 0,

(qra)  b = (1)|a|a  qlb,
{qb, ql} = {qb, qr} = 0.

using these relations we derive

shif tz   a   = z   [qb, q]a,
shif tz   y qb = z qby qqb = 0.

(5.16)

(5.17)

(5.18)

(5.19)

(5.20)

this shows that the total action (5.1) is invariant under the nonlinear supersymmetry

transformation obtained by combining (5.7) and shif t,

a = q,
 = qqli + x(


2

)qa.

(5.21)

(5.22)

we recognize that the rst term in (5.22) can actually be absorbed into the second

term by making the following eld redenition,

a + y (


2

)qii  a

(5.23)

which simultaneously eliminates the quadratic terms from the action. this property is

a direct consequence of the fact that the string eld action can be derived from the

action with only the purely cubic interaction terms [20] by making the eld redenition
a  a + y ( 
2 )qii. therefore the above nonlinear (inhomogeous) transformation law is
simply a corollary of the supersymmetry of the cubic interaction terms under the linear

supersymmetry transformation.

in this way, all the results of the present section nicely t to what we have derived in

the world-sheet approach. the existence of purely cubic action is a natural consequence

of the general fact that in the world-sheet approach, especially in its covariant version, the

free motion and the interactions of strings are one and the same thing from the viewpoint

of the local world-sheet dynamics. in fact, that was the original motivation for the cubic

action conjecture [21][20][22].

25

6. discussions

problems of contact terms

as we have already mentioned during the discussions of string-eld theory approach, there

is the subtle question of possible contact terms [23] beyond 3-point interactions. this is

basically due to singularities caused by the midpoint insertion of picture changing oper-

ators. for a recent discussion on this problem, see ref.

[24] and references therein. if

the higher contact terms are really inescapable, the formal transformation law given in

section 5 might also be subject to corrections which are at least quadratic in string elds.

the investigation along this direction is beyond the scope of the present paper. our argu-

ments using the ordinary world-sheet approach already provided reasonable evidence that

there exists the n = 2 space-time supersymmetry. the problem of contact terms might

be an indication that we should seek for other more tractable approach to formulate the

nonperturbative physics of string theory than the traditional string-eld theory approach.

chan-paton factor

it is straightforward to include the chan-paton factor. let us only mention the case of

string eld theory. for unstable n d9-branes of type iia theory, the gso projection is
not done at all and hence we simply extend all the string elds to be hermitian n  n
matrices which transform in the adjoint representation of u(n) group,

a  a+,ij + a,ij,   +,ij + ,ij.

the star multiplication of the string elds is supplemented by the matrix multiplication

and the integration by the trace operation. note that the supersymmetry parameter must

be singlet under the gauge group. corresponding to the existence of both g-parity elds,

we have iia type supersymmetry.

in type iib theory, we consider the systems with equal number of d9 and anti-d9

branes to cancel the tadpole anomaly coming from the rr 10 form potential. for strings

which connect d9-branes only within the d9-branes or only within the anti d9-branes,

the ordinary gso projection is assumed, while for strings which connect d9 and anti-d9

branes the opposite gso projection is assumed. therefore, the inclusion of chan-paton

factor is represented by the matrix string elds of the following form, which transform as

26

the adjoint representation of u(n)u(n) group,

a    a+,ij

 a

,j

 a,ik

a+,k ! ,     +,ij

 

,j

 ,ik

+,k ! .

actually, our discussions in previous sections must be subject to a small change in type

iib case. as shown in the above assignment of the opposite g-parity elds, the transfor-
mation laws of the string elds with respect to the group u(n) u(n) are dierent for
the positive and negative g-parity elds. to be consisitent with the gauge symmetry, the

supersymmetry transformation must be singlet under the gauge group. this forbids the

supersymmetry parameter with negative g-parity. however, there are now two indepen-

dent supersymmetry parameters + and + , both of which belong to the same positive

chirality corresponding to the zero-momentum limit of the two positive g-parity open
string elds +,ij and +,k. this leads to a chiral n = 2 supersymmetry as it should be.
condensation of tachyon

an important future problem is to investigate the tachyon condensation in light of our

arguments. there is already a discussion by sen [6](see also a more recent work by

sen and zwiebach [26] based on some old works [27]) of tachyon condensation from the

viewpoint of string eld theory. we do not have much to say in the present paper other

than what we have already remarked. however, let us look at the concrete form of the

eld equation which we have to solve. it is sucient to study the problem after making

the eld redenition (5.23). the eld equations are then, neglecting the possible higher

contact terms and integrating over the g-parity coorinates,

a+  a+ + a  a = 0,

a  a+ + a+  a = 0,

a+  + + +  a+ + a   +   a = 0,
a  + +   a+ + a+   + +  a = 0.

the condensation of tachyon corresponds to nonzero a. also, the supersymmetric

(and/or bps) solutions with vanishing fermion backgrounds must satisfy

qa = 0

27

for certain constant spinor . it is important to note that the solutions described by these

equations do not have the ordinary kinetic term in the action. thus even if some of the

gauge symmetry remains unbroken after the tachyon condensation, there is in general no

propagation of massless elds corresponding to unbroken gauge symmetry. instead, the

propagating modes must be determined anew on the new background dened by the so-

lutions themselves. this conforms to some related observations made in [5][25] and seems

to indicate the resolution of a puzzle [3] associated with the k-theoretical interpretation

of d-branes. remember also that this phenomenon has already been anticipated in a

motivating discussion in section 2. the condensation of tachyon makes the supersymme-

try transformation linear and simultaneously eliminates the kinetic term. it is interesting

to investigate how to represent this situation in a low-energy eld-theory approximation.

work along this direction is in progress and will be reported in a forthcoming paper [28].

finally, one of the fundamental problems related to the subject of the present work

is to establish connections with the ordinary closed-string approach of type ii string

theory. that would not only lead to a new unexpected connection among dierent eld

theories in the low-energy limit, but also provide an important clue towards the dynamical

formulation of m-theory.
