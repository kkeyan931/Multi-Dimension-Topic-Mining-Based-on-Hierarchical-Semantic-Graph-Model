(recall fourth generation neutrino mass 45 65 gev.) note mechanism generating small majorana masses require bulk right-handed neutrinos. role fourth generation right-handed neutrino played linear combination neutral gauginos, rst three generations acquire majorana masses via mixing fourth generation neutrino. nonetheless, presence states ni scenario still required anomaly cancellation, dierent states need bulk elds. thus, assume propagate large extra dimensions. however, localized brane elds li, would generically unacceptably large dirac neutrino masses coming allowed couplings lnl 4. remedied assuming states ni localized distant brane (or, alternatively, come dierent xed points context orbifold compactications7 - see next section), case couplings least exponentially suppressed. iv. gauge coupling unification section discuss gauge coupling unication tssm4. since unica- tion scale, identify string scale, tev range, unication mechanism must dierent mssm.  unication mecha- nism proposed. thus, let standard model elds localized dp-branes (where p = 4, 5) p 3 extra directions compactied space linear size(s) order r. let us assume r 1/ms. kaluza-klein (kk) threshold 1/r cut-o ms (rms)p3 heavy kk modes carrying corresponding gauge quantum numbers. states contribute gauge coupling running scale 1/r, interested contributions states (that corresponding thresholds) low energy (that is, scales 1/r ms) gauge coupling renormal- ization one loop, proportional number states n (rms)p3 1. thus, one hope might possibility accelerated unication ms tev range. explained detail {$9905137$}, mechanism would predictive power unless adapt supersymmetric context zero modes compactication (corresponding, particular, standard model elds) n = 1 supersymmetric, 7thus, instance, assume brane sitting orbifold xed point elds ni come dierent xed point, couplings ln l 4 would suppressed exponential factor exp(c(rms)2), r (roughly) linear size dimensions along orbifold xed points separated (and dimensions assumed large enough exponential factor adequately suppressed), c model dependent numerical constant order 1. 9 heavy kk modes n = 2 supersymmetry. reason higher loop eects would otherwise large one-loop threshold contribution large number n heavy kk modes circulating loops. underlying n = 2 supersymmetry heavy kk modes guarantees, shown {$9905137$}, higher loop eects subleading compared leading one-loop threshold contribution. due well known non-renormalization property n = 2 gauge theories. note, however, that, stressed {$9905137$}, higher loop cancellations due underlying supersymmetry persist supersymmetry breaking msusy 1/r. one key reasons assume ms least 10 100 tev. discuss possible geometric embeddings (via orbifolds) compactications next subsection. let us assume zero modes n = 1 supersymmetric one-loop -function coecients br, r = 1, 2, 3 (here r labels corresponding subgroup su(3)c su(2)w u(1)y ), heavy kk levels populated n = 2 supermultiplets one-loop -function coecients ebr. dicult show unication gauge couplings model precise mssm (at one loop) following constraint satised: rs independent r, s, rs ebr ebs r b b r 6= s.
