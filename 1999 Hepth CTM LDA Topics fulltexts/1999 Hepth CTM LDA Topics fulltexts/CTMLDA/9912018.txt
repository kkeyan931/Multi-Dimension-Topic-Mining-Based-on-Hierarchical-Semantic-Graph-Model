(10) suv represents uv part eective action, obtained original high energy action prescribed specic string compactication, integrating degrees 6 freedom energy larger ir cut-o scale set r0, sir remaining contribution lower energy degrees freedom. suv therefore essence describes einstein action 4-dimensional gravity, coupled scalar elds i. values couplings suv, newton cosmological constant, determined initial values derived kaluza-klein reduction, corrected eects quantum uctuations given cut-o scale. sir, hand, best thought non-local quantum eective action gauge matter system uv cut-o set r0. although split considered general context, instructive view holographic projection inside boundary theory geometric split (6) space-time manifold warped string compactication scenario discussed above. let us assume 4-d eld theory suciently strong coupling large enough gauge group, dual supergravity system warped compactication manifold (5) well approximated classical eld equations. case apply standard ads/cft dictionary, identify 5-d scalar elds given radial position r matter couplings corresponding scale. particular identify low-energy contribution sir part classical supergravity action coming integral near-horizon region ir sir(, g) = zirlsugra.
