abstract

we construct non-supersymmetric four dimensional gauge theories arising as eective the-

ories of d-branes placed on various singularities in type 0b string theory. we mostly

focus on models which are conformal in the large n limit and present both examples ap-

pearing on self-dual d3-branes on orbifold singularities and examples including orientifold

planes. moreover, we derive type 0 hanany-witten setups with ns 5-branes intersected

by d-branes and the corresponding rules for determining the massless spectra. finally,

we discuss possible duality symmetries (seiberg-duality) for non-supersymmetries gauge

theories within this framework.

1. introduction

in recent years we have gained new insights about non-perturbative aspects of su-

persymmetric gauge theories by studying them as eective low energy theories arising on
d-branes in string theory. this includes for instance the derivation of the n =2 seiberg-
witten curve from the embedding of ve-branes in m-theory [1], as well as, the malda-

cena conjecture [2] stating that conformal gauge theories arising on parallel d3-branes in
type iib string theory are in the limit of large t hooft coupling  = g2

y m n and large n

dual to supergravity theories on an ads5-background.

in particular the maldacena conjecture in the large n limit has been generalised to

the non-supersymmetric case by placing d3-branes on non-supersymmetric singularities

[3,4]. generically, without supersymmetry on the string theory side one expects a dilaton

potential to be generated by string-loop corrections, so that only in the large n limit one

can expect the corresponding non-supersymmetric gauge theories to be conformal. for

nite n one gets 1/n corrections and one still hopes that the exact  functions allow

at least one interacting xed point.

in a recent proposal [5] such non-supersymmetric

conformal gauge theories were advertised as a dierent scenario to solve the hierarchy

problem of scales. instead of a supersymmetric gauge theory broken in the tev range,

one might use a non-supersymmetric gauge theory which is conformal above some scale

close to the weak scale. however, as pointed out recently in [6] the one loop quadratic

divergence of the higgs mass does not cancel in subleading orders in n.

a dierent approach towards non-supersymmetric gauge theories was pushed forward

by klebanov and tseytlin [7,8,9] following an idea by polyakov [10]. they studied the

ten-dimensional tachyonic type 0b theory and found the remarkable result that non-trivial

rr-ux can remove the tachyonic instability. they studied both the case of parallel electric

d3-branes and the case of parallel self-dual d3-branes. in the former case one gets a su(n)

gauge theory, with six adjoint scalars, in which the one-loop renormalization group ow of

the gauge coupling is correctly captured by the non-constant dilaton in the type 0b gravity

solution. in the case of self-dual d3-branes, in the limit of large n and  < 100 they found a
stable ads5s5 solution, implying that in the large n limit the gauge theory is conformal.
this was further supported by an explicit computation of the two loop -function for the

gauge coupling. it vanished in the large n limit but contained the expected non-zero 1/n

corrections. in [11] it was pointed out that this model can also be obtained as a zz2 orbifold

of type iib and thus is a member of the class of non-supersymmetric models studied in

1

[3,4]. therefore, the general arguments presented in [12] were applicable implying that

the non-supersymmetric gauge theory in question is conformal to all orders in the large

n limit. meanwhile, there have been discussions of several related issues of type 0 string

theories such as the infrared behaviour [13], the physics of d-branes [14,15,16,17], branes

on conifold singularities [18], orientifolds of type 0b [19,20,21] and dualities [22].

in this paper we will systematically study non-supersymmetric gauge theories arising

on self-dual d3-branes sitting on various singularities in type 0b. in the case of supersym-

metric singularities, the non-supersymmetric theories have some common features with

their corresponding supersymmetric type iib cousins. since the open string annulus am-

plitude for self-dual d3-branes is up to factor of two the same as the corresponding type iib

amplitude, all models have the same number of bosons and fermions. in this sense they are

special and similar to the compact non-supersymmetric models discussed in [23]. using

the arguments given in [12], in the large n limit all correlation functions of the type 0b

theories reduce to the correlation functions of the parent n=4 gauge theory. thus, the

type 0b orbifold theories are conformal in the large n limit. actually, it turns out that

they have the same one-loop -function as their supersymmetric cousins and the rst 1/n

corrections appear at two loops. as we mentioned before, these type 0b gauge theories are

a very special subset of large n non-supersymmetric conformal gauge theories and inherit

some nice features from the corresponding supersymmetric gauge theories. due to this,

we think they deserve particular interest.

as was pointed out in [24,25] and further elaborated in [19,20,21] there exist dierent

orientifold projections in type 0b. we will also study eective gauge theories on self-dual

d3-branes on orientifolds. in contrast to the pure orbifold case, generically there remain

some uncancelled twisted nsns tadpoles, which are however suppressed in the large n

limit. thus we can still construct large n conformal gauge theories now including orthog-

onal and symplectic gauge groups and also matter in the (anti-)symmetric representation

of the unitary gauge factors. the corresponding supersymmetric cases were discussed in

[26,27].

for the supersymmetric case, it is well established that d3-branes on ale type sin-

gularities are t-dual to cyclic hanany-witten models [28,29,30,31,32,33]. using the low

energy eective action derived in [7], we will argue that the same holds for self-dual d3-

branes in type 0b. essentially, since in the eective theory for self-dual d3-branes the
tachyon has the expectation value hti = 0, as long as the solution is stable the theory
reduces to the type iib eective theory and everything carries over.

2

thus, using ns 5-branes and dyonic d-branes we construct the type 0 analogue of

hanany-witten models. this can be done for non-conformal cases, as well. we will discuss
the n =2 hanany-witten models in some more detail, including the determination of
the massless spectrum and some comments about the moduli space. the ultimate goal

would of course be, to gain some higher loop or non-perturbative information using the
recently proposed duality of type 0a to m-theory on s1/(1)fss [22].

2. branes on orbifold singularities in type 0b

in this section we study non-supersymmetric gauge theories obtained by placing d3-

branes on orbifold singularities [34] in type 0b string theory. as was already observed in

[8], in order to obtain a large n conformal theory one needs to have an equal number of

electric and magnetic d3-branes. if we would not take the same number of electric and

magnetic d-branes the annulus amplitude would be non-vanishing implying a non-trivial

dilaton potential. in the eld theory this would lead to a non-vanishing one loop  function

even in the large n limit. to begin with we briey review the denition of type 0b and

the parent gauge theory living on parallel d3-branes.

2.1. type 0b string theory

the superstring the projection p = 1

there are two ways of constructing type 0b string theory. one is by implementing in
2 (1 + (1)fl+fr) [35]. in contrast to the usual gso
projection the tachyon survives and all space-time fermionic modes are projected out.

the second way of constructing type 0b is by an orbifold of type iib by the space-time
fermion number (1)fs. this removes all fermions from the untwisted sector and leads to a
tachyon and further massless rr elds in the twisted sector. computing the spectrum one

nds that all states in the rr sector are doubled implying that all dp-branes (p odd) are
doubled, as well. in the case of d3-branes now there exist electric (d3) and magnetic (d3)

branes. using the boundary state approach it was shown in [19] that indeed the boundary

state representing a dp brane in type iib splits into two boundary states of type 0b. the

explicit form of the boundary states was used to derive rules for open strings stretched

between the various types of dp branes. open strings stretched between the same kind of

dp branes carry only space-time bosonic modes, whereas open strings stretched between
a d3 and a d3-brane carry only space-time fermionic modes.

now we consider type 0b as the orbifold of type iib by (1)fs and compute the annulus

which is exactly the amplitude for the same number of electric and magnetic d3-branes

in type 0b. up to a factor of two this is identical with the annulus amplitude for n

d3-branes in type iib.

in particular, even without supersymmetry the amplitude

vanishes and one does not get any tachyonic tadpole.

b.) for n = 2n and m = 0 (2.3) reduces to

a =

(2.5)

which is nothing else than the amplitude for 2n electric d3-branes. as we mentioned

above in this case one only gets space-time bosonic modes and a tachyonic tadpole in

the tree channel.

from these two examples we learn that the numbers m and n in the (1)fs matrix are
exactly the number of d3 and d3-branes in type 0b. the massless spectra living on the

d3-branes in the two cases a.) and b.) are

1 this is the string theoretic analogue of the construction made in [11] in the context of the

gauge theories.

4

a.) gauge group g = su(n)  su(n) 2, one complex boson in the adjoint and four

weyl-fermions in the (n, n) + (n, n) representation of g.

b.) gauge group g = su(2n) with three complex bosons in the adjoint representation of

su(2n).

in case a.) the one-loop -function vanishes and as was shown explicitly in [8] the two-loop

-function vanishes only in the large n limit. as was already observed in [11], since we

have embedded the gauge theory into type iib string theory with a  matrix of vanishing

trace, the general arguments of [12] tell us that in the large n limit the non-supersymmetric
su(n)su(n) gauge theory is conformal. in the rest of this section we present the massless
spectra obtained by putting self-dual d3-branes on singularities preserving n =2, n =1 and
n =0 supersymmetry, respectively.

2.2. d3-branes on n =2, zzk singularities

we are considering the zzk singularity described by the action

 =( z1  z1
z2  1z2 with  = e2i/k
z3  z3

(2.6)

on the three complex coordinates transversal to m d3-branes. this case has also been

discussed in [36]. note, that since we are considering non-compact models there is no need
to restrict to zzk actions having a crystallographic action on the t 4 torus and therefore
every non-negative integer k is allowed. as we have discussed in the last subsection, the

annulus amplitudes for self-dual d3-branes in type 0b are up to factor of two identical to

the annulus amplitudes for d3-branes in type iib. this means that the twisted tadpole

cancellation conditions are the same, as well. moreover, it means that the type 0b spectrum

is bose-fermi degenerated. as was shown in [37], since  leaves one coordinate invariant,

all twisted tadpoles are of logarithmic type

k1

xk=1 z 

0

dl
l

tr(k )tr(1

k ).

(2.7)

these tadpoles are in one to one correspondence with the vanishing of the one-loop 

function of the gauge couplings. even without cancelling them, one gets an anomaly free

gauge theory. we will see that the same holds for the type 0b case.

where the upper row in the matrix notation refers to the gauge groups on the d3-branes

and the lower row refers to the gauge groups on the d3-branes. from (2.12) it is evident

that even without cancelling the tadpoles the non-chiral spectrum is free of non-abelian

gauge anomalies. requiring cancellation of the logarithmic tadpoles leads to nj = m/k
for all j  {1, . . . , k} implying indeed that the one-loop -function vanishes.

and the one-loop  function of the corresponding gauge coupling is

(2.17)

which agrees with the data for the n =1 supersymmetric model in (2.14). both the anom-
alies and the one-loop  functions vanish if all tadpoles are cancelled for nj = n .

7

2.4. d3-branes on n =0, zzk singularities

since we are interested in models without supersymmetry there is no need to consider

supersymmetric singularities only. however, to have a well dened string description one

has to guarantee that the model satises level matching. let us examine one specic
example, where we rst consider the type iib orbifold case. we start with the zz2 action
 : zi  zi for all i  {1, 2, 3}. checking for level matching one realizes that one gets
e = 1
4 which cannot be compensated in a zz2 orbifold. indeed, since k = 2 and li = 1/2,
 does not satisfy the consistency condition k(l1 + l2 + l3) = even. if one would naively
continue and compute the open string sector one would indeed nd some inconsistencies
there, as well. however, it is possible to consider the orbifold action above as a zz4 orbifold,
~l = 1

requiring tadpole cancellation leads to the  matrix

satisfying 4

which is free of non-abelian gauge anomalies and has vanishing one-loop  function, as well.

so far all the type 0b spectra we derived had only an even number of unitary gauge groups

and bifundamental matter. the generalisation to orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups

and an odd number of unitary gauge factors is achieved by using type 0b orientifolds.

8

3. non-susy gauge theories from orientifolds of type 0b

as was rst pointed out in [24] and elaborated further in [25,19,20,21,22], in the ten-

dimensional type 0b string theory there exist three dierent orientifold projections.

i.) first, one has the usual world-sheet parity transformation , which in ten-dimensions

leads to a model containing tachyons both in the closed and in the open string sector.

the tachyon in the open string sector is due to the untwisted tadpole cancellation

condition requiring the introduction of d9 and anti d9-branes. we will see that due to

the weaker tadpole cancellation conditions in the non-compact case, one can get rid of

the open string tachyons leading to sensible gauge theories on the d3-branes including

orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups. in order to avoid tachyonic tadpoles in the

annulus amplitude, we will always work with self-dual d3-branes in the following.

ii.) as was shown in [21], the dressed parity transformation  =  (1)fr projects out the
ten-dimensional closed string tachyon and does lead to a model necessarily containing

the same number of d9 and d9-branes. the latter point is simply an implication of
the fact that the world-sheet fermion number operator (1)fr exchanges dp and dp
branes. in the non-compact case such models also contain only self-dual d3-branes

and generically lead to an odd number of unitary gauge factors and some fermions in

the antisymmetric representation.

iii.) the third kind of ten-dimensional orientifolds of type 0b uses the combination
 =  (1)fl and was discussed in [22]. since (1)fl exchanges d-branes with
the corresponding anti d-brane, these models always contain open string tachyonic

modes and thus they do not seem to be suitable for constructing large n conformal

gauge theories.

more specically, we are interested in orientifolds by  = (1)flj and  = (1)flj,
respectively, where j denotes the zz2 transformation zi  zi for all i  {1, 2, 3} and fl is
the left-moving space time fermion number operator. note, that  and  are t-dual to the
ten-dimensional  and  discussed in i.) and ii.) above. besides the world sheet parity

transformation we are also gauging a further discrete space time symmetry zzk acting as

receives only contributions from the untwisted closed string sector and for even k also
from the k/2 twisted sector.

the  orientifold

since  contains (1)fr the klein bottle amplitude for type 0b string theory is up to
factor of two the truncation of the type iib klein bottle amplitude to terms containing
the insertion (1)fr in the trace. however, these are exactly the terms leading to rr
exchange in the tree channel interpretation of the amplitude. the actual computation of

(3.1) is identical to the type iib computations presented in [38,27].

in order to cancel the rr tadpoles in the  orientifold one introduces d3/d3-branes
and in case of even k also d7/d7-branes in the background. in the following we will re-
strict ourselves to the k odd case, the generalisation to cases including d7/d7-branes is

straightforward. as we have reviewed in the section 2, the cylinder amplitude for the same
number of d3 and d3-branes is exactly twice the amplitude for d3-branes in type iib and
in particular it vanishes. moreover, since  exchanges d3 with d3-branes, the only non-

vanishing contribution to the mobius strip amplitude arises from open strings stretched
between d3 and d3-branes. this again is exactly twice the ramond part of the mobius

amplitude for d3-branes in type iib. note, that unlike the annulus amplitude the mobius

amplitude is non-zero and thus spoils the bose-fermi degeneracy. thus, the tadpole can-

cellation conditions for rr exchange are identical to the corresponding conditions in the

analogous type iib orientifold. however there always remains an uncancelled twisted nsns

tadpole, which in the string context can be cancelled by the fischler/susskind mechanism

[39].

the twisted rr tadpole cancellation conditions for the corresponding type iib orien-

tifolds have been derived in [38,27]

(3.2)

tr(2k ) = 

1

q3
i=1 cos(cid:0) kvi
k (cid:1)

where the two dierent signs refer to the two possible actions of  on the chan-paton fac-

tors, namely whether   is antisymmetric or symmetric. remember, that in the compact

case this ambiguity is xed by the untwisted tadpole cancellation condition. as shown
in [38], condition (3.2) always has a solution. taking into account that  exchanges d3

10

and d3-branes a consistent choice of  matrices in the type 0b orientifold in terms of the

corresponding  matrices in the type iib orientifold is

 =(cid:18) 

0

0

(cid:19)2m,2m

,

  =(cid:18) 0





0 (cid:19)2m,2m

,

(3.3)

where m denotes the number of self-dual d3-branes. note, that due to the tadpole can-
cellation condition (3.2) for k  1 tr(2k ) is of order o(n0), whereas tr(1) is of order
o(n). thus, one expects the eect of the remaining twisted nsns tadpoles to be sup-

pressed in the large n limit. we will indeed nd, that opposed to the models in section 2

the one-loop  function of the gauge coupling receives 1/n corrections.

the  orientifold

the story for the  orientifold is a bit dierent. the klein bottle amplitude with the 

insertion in (3.1) only contains terms leading to nsns exchange in tree channel. here, we
also introduce the same number of d3 and d3-branes, but in contrast to the compact case

there is no untwisted rr tadpole and therefore no need to introduce anti-branes, as well.

thus, we do not have to worry about extra tachyons. the mobius amplitude contains only

traces over the ns sector leading to terms in the nsns exchange channel. summarising,

only the annulus amplitude contains twisted rr tadpoles, whereas all three amplitudes

contribute to twisted nsns tadpoles. thus, in order to cancel the dangerous rr tadpoles

one has to require

tr(k ) = 0

(3.4)

and like the  case one is left with an uncancelled massless twisted nsns tadpole. a

consistent choice of  matrices in the  orientifold is

 =(cid:18) 

0

0

(cid:19)2m,2m

,

 =(cid:18) 

0

0

(cid:19)2m,2m

.

(3.5)

in the following we discuss a couple of examples of both  and  orientifolds.

3.1. orientifolds on n =4 singularities

the simplest model is taking the brane conguration from section 2.1 and gauge the
world-sheet parity transformation. the corresponding type iib model is n =4 susy so(m)

or sp(2m) gauge theory. however, due to the dierent action of  on the chan-paton

factors in the type 0b model one obtains the following gauge group

equipped with the bosonic and fermionic matter

g = su(n)

3(adj)b + 4(cid:16) + (cid:17)f

for symmetric  one gets the symmetric representation in (3.7) instead of the antisym-

metric. computing the one-loop  function coecient one realizes that it vanishes only in

the large n limit

note, that for the antisymmetric representation the model is asymptotically free. the

general form of the two-loop gauge coupling coecient -function has been derived in [40]

where c2(r) denotes the eigenvalue of the second order casimir in the representation r
and t2(r) denotes the dynkin-index of r. the contribution of the yukawa couplings is

given by

y4 =

(3.10)

where yi denotes the matrix of the yukawa couplings. taking into account the global
su(4) symmetry and the gauge structure of yi , as in [8], leads to y4 = 24(n2  3n + 4/n).
hence, the n2 term vanishes. up to order g7 the  function is given by

for n  2 the coecients b2 and b1 have opposite signs, which at least supports the hope
that there exists an interacting xed-point for some nite value of the coupling constant
g. unfortunately, (3.11) implies g2

 = o(1/n) telling us that for large but nite n higher

loop contributions to the  function can not be neglected.

where again the highest order terms vanish and b2 and b1 have opposite sign.

in contrast to section 2, in all type 0b orientifold models we studied the one-loop 

function vanished only in the large n limit. the string theoretic reason for the running

of the gauge coupling is, that in contrast to the annulus amplitude the mobius amplitude

does not vanish. this one-loop cosmological constant induces a dilaton potential which

prevents the dilaton from being a free parameter. since, the mobius amplitude is 1/n

suppressed against the annulus amplitude, in the eld theory this scenario induces a 1/n

correction to the one-loop  function.

3.2. orientifolds on n =2 singularities

representation of the corresponding  orientifold.

3.3. orientifolds on n =1 singularities

in this case one can not give such a closed form for the spectra depending on the
vector  = 1
k (v1, v2, v3) with v1 + v2 + v3 = 0. however, it is a straightforward exercise to
nd the solution of (3.2) and then use the explicit form of  to determine the spectrum
of the desired model. here we would only like to discuss the simplest model, which is the
zz3 orientifold. the gauge group for the  orientifold is

3.4. orientifolds on n =0 singularities

in this section we will discuss orientifolds of both type iib and type 0b on a non-
5 (0, 1, 3) and satises

supersymmetric zz5 singularity. the zz5 action is dened as  = 1
level matching. solving for the twisted rr tadpole conditions yields

 = diag[1n+2, n , 2

n , 3

n , 4

n ].

(3.23)

there are also tachyon and dilaton tadpoles in the nsns exchange channel, however they

are cancelled automatically since they always appear in the same combination with the

rr channel tadpoles. one obtains the following gauge group of the type iib orientifold

g = so(n + 2)  su(n)  su(n)

with this non-supersymmetric example we nish our discussion of type 0b orientifold

models.

4. d3-branes on n =1 conifold singularities in type 0b

while for branes at orbifold singularities the spectrum can be derived from perturba-

tive string calculations, this is not anymore the case placing d3-branes at transversal coni-

fold singularities. here the spectrum has to be determined by an educated guess work,

which of course has to pass several subsequent consistency requirements by considering

various known limits. the supersymmetric type iib d3-branes at conifold singularities,
leading to n =1 supersymmetric eld theories, were rst discussed in [41]. this discussion
was then extended in [31,32,33]. we start with the 6-dimensional conifold singularity c,
which can be described by the following hypersurface in c4:

c :

xy = uv.

(4.1)

this case was recently studies in [18]. as a rst generalization we consider orbifolds of
the conifold singularity, namely the quotient c/,  = zzk  zzl, i.e. x  e2i/kx,

16

y  e2i/k y, u  e2i/lu, v  e2i/lv. the corresponding hypersurface in c4 is
determined by the equation

ckl :

(xy)l = (uv)k.

(4.2)

this singularity is probed by n self-dual d3-branes (m = n = n ). the spectrum can be

obtained from the related n = 1 supersymmetric models of d3-branes on these spaces in
type iib superstrings [31,33] via the (1)fs projection. the gauge group has the following
form

kl

g =

oj=1

(su (n )e  su (n )e  su (n )m  su (n )m) .

(4.3)

the subscript e (m) stands here for electric (magnetic) gauge group due to the n d3
(d3) branes. we label each pair of electric plus magnetic group factor su (n )esu (n )m
by indices i, i = 1 . . . k and j, j = 1 . . . l. then we obtain four types of massless scalar

and fermion matter elds which are bifundamental under the gauge groups indicated by

the indices:

,  :

(a1)i+1,j+1;i,j = ( i+1,j+1,

i,j ),

(a2)i,j;i,j = ( i,j,

i,j ),

(b1)i,j;i,j+1 = ( i,j,

i,j+1),

(b2)i,j;i+1,j+1 = ( i,j,

i+1,j+1).

(4.4)

the scalars are bi-fundamental under two electric or two magnetic gauge group factors.

on the other hand, with respect to the indices e and m, the fermions are either in the

representations ( e, m) or ( m,
are bifundamental under electric/magnetic gauge groups with identical set of indices:

e). in addition there are also massless fermions which

 :

( e

i,j, m

i,j) + ( m
i,j,

e
i,j) + ( e

i,j , m

i,j ) + ( m

i,j ,

e
i,j ).

(4.5)

the corresponding 1-loop -function takes again the same value as in the corresponding

type iib parent model.

just like in the corresponding n =1 models there exist a special higgs branch in this
class of models [33]. specically, giving a vev to all a2 type scalar elds corresponds to
resolving the original conifold singularity to the well known orbifold singularity c3/(zzk 
ij pair
zzl).
down to its diagonal subgroup. the remaining three types massless elds after the higgs

in this way all the a2 scalar elds will break each su (n )e,m

ij  su (n )e,m

mechanism are precisely the horizontal, vertical and diagonal representations which one
gets on the zzk  zzl orbifold models.

17

let us briey consider a dierent class of conifold singularities which can by regarded

[33] as the mirror geometries of the orbifolded conifold spaces eq.(4.2) considered before.

specically, these six-dimensional generalized conifold singularities are dened as

gkl :

xy = uk vl.

(4.6)

as usual we easily determine the eld theory from the underlying n =1 models [31]. the
gauge group for n self-dual d3 branes is given by

g =

k+l

oj=1

(su (n )e  su (n )m) .

(4.7)

without going into too many details, there are bifundamental massless fermions and scalars

in the ( ,

) of adjacent gauge group factors. furthermore, depending on dierent choices

of b-eld backgrounds, there are adjoint scalar multiplets. finally, there are as usual

massless fermions in electric/magenetic bifundamentals of gauge groups with identical

indices.

5. the supergravity description and t-duality

5.1. d3-branes at transversal singularities

in this section we want to discuss the general form of the supergravity solutions for d3-

branes at transversal singularities in type 0 string constructions. following the discussion
in [18] we will assume that the background is asymptotically of the form m4  y6, where
m4 is at minkowski space-time, corresponding to the d3 world volume, and y6 is the

non-compact transversal space with a singularity at some xed locus. in case of the six-

dimensional orbifold and conifold singularities, we considered in the last section, y6 is given

as a cone over a ve-dimensional compact manifold x5, the so-called horizon. locally the

metric on y6 can then be written in the form

dy2

6 = dr2 + r2 d2
x ,

(5.1)

where r is the radial coordinate on y6. asymptotically, for large and small r the combined,
near-horizon metric of the d3-branes at y6 should take the form ads5  x5. in between,
the near-horizon metric is given by a warped product m4  y6, where y6 is a bration

18

of x5 over the radial coordinate r, in general being dierent from the original transversal

space y6.

explicitly we consider the following ansatz for the 10-dimensional metric metric

[7,8,18]:

x ,

(5.2)

where () and () are functions which depend on the radial coordinate , and () is

the dilaton. these functions, together with four-form gauge elds have to be determined

as solutions of the equation of motions of the type 0 string eective action. they depend

crucially on the potential of the tachyon eld which is present in the type 0 string models.

this tachyon potential contains the following typical terms:

h(t ) = m2f (t ) +

n2
f (t )

,

f (t ) = 1 + t +

t 2
2

.

(5.3)

here, m is the number of electric d3-branes and n the number of magnetic d3-branes. like

before we consider the two cases of either purely electric (or purely magnetic) d3-branes

or self-dual d3-branes.

(i) self-dual d3-branes

in this case we have m = n = n . the corresponding tachyon equations of motion

are solved for vanishing tachyon eld t = 0. hence the tachyon drops out from all the

remaining equations of motion which are then identical to the equations of motion of n d3-

branes at a transversal singularity y6 in the corresponding type iib superstring. namely,
for self-dual d3-branes the near horizon metric is precisely of the form ads5  x5, which
corresponds to vanishing functions  and  and constant dilaton eld. after a change of
variables  = r4, the metric can be written as

ds2

e =

dxdx +

(5.4)

this is precisely the near horizon metric of n self-dual d3-branes at the six-dimensional,
transversal singularity y6, i.e. the full d3-brane metric is obtained by replacing n
harmonic function h = 1 + n

r4 (suppressing the factors gs and ).

let us study the orbifold singularities in a little more detail. the horizon x5 is just
the ve-sphere modded out by the relevant discrete group : x5 = s5/. dening s5
via its embedding in r6 by the equation |z1|2 + |z2|2 + |z3|2 = 1, the group  acts on
the three complex coordinates zi precisely as discussed in section 2. consider e.g. the
simplest n =2 supersymmetric orbifold singularities where  = zzk acts as z1  e2i 1
k z1,
z2  e2i 1
k z2, z3  z3. replacing the singularity at z1 = z2 = 0 by a smooth 2-sphere,
y6 is given by the product c  alek1, where the four-dimensional spaces alek1
describe the resolutions of the ak1 singularities and are complex two-dimensional non-
compact relatives of k3, i.e. non-compact ricci-at hyper-kahler manifolds.3 the ale

manifolds of the ak1 series correspond to the metrics given by the gibbons-hawking

multi-center ansatz

dy2

4 = v (~x)d~x2 + v 1(~x)(d + ~  d~x)2

with the self-duality condition ~v = ~  ~, and

v =

(5.5)

(5.6)

this space mk1 is the smooth resolution of the singular variety xy = zk in c3 of
type ak1 with mk1 = s3/zzk . the singular situation corresponds to the pol-terms
coalescing: v = k
|~x| .

on the other hand, before we have constructed the transversal singularity as a simple

zzk orbifold. hence, we like to briey recall (for the case k = 2) that in fact the ale-
metric (5.5) and the metric of the orbifold c2/zzk can be obtained from each other by
a simple coordinate transformation. for k = 2, the two-center gibbons-hawking metric

(5.5) takes the following explicit form

structed as brations of (two) ale spaces.

(5.9)

this is precisely the eguchi-hanson metric. in the singular situation, z0 = 0, this metric
just describes the orbifold space c2/zz2, since the range of  is 0   < . note that
resolving the singularity, i.e. z0 6= 0, the metric of the transversal space y6 is not anymore
of the form (5.1), but there are corrections of the form

dy2

6 = r2(cid:18) dr2

r2 + d2

x + o(

r2 )(cid:19).

(5.10)

(ii) electric d3-branes

next we wish to discuss briey the supergravity solutions for entirely electric d3-

branes, i.e. we have m = n , n = 0 in the tachyon potential. now the tachyon equations
of motion are solved for non vanishing tachyon eld: t = 1 + . . .. as a consequence, the
ten-dimensional metric is only asymptotically in the uv of the form ads5s5; for general
values of  the functions () and () are non-trivial, and the dilaton now becomes a radius

dependent function. however the solution cannot be given anymore in closed form, but
they can be expanded around the asymptotic uv (  0) ads5  s5 solution. explicitly,
the rst terms in this expansion are given as

 = (log )1,

 = (log )1,  = log(

213
27n

)  2 log( log ).

(5.11)

21

due to the presence of these non-trivial functions, the ten-dimensional metric looks like
the metric of d3-branes now at a transversal six-dimensional space y6, which only asymp-
totically in the uv is given by the original singularity y6, but in general has the form of
being a warped product over the ve-dimensional horizon x5 ( = r4):

(5.13)

using the change of coordinates in (5.8) it is straightforward to transform this metric into a

metric which asymptotically approaches the two-center gibbons-hawking metric in (5.7).

5.2. t-dual supergravity description  d4-branes and ns 5-branes

in the last section we have described the supergravity picture of n d3-branes sitting
a six-dimensional transversal singularity y6 (resp. y6) in type 0b string theory. now we
like to discuss the t-dual picture of d4-branes which are intersected by a certain number

of ns 5-branes. in order to keep the discussion simple we only consider the supergravity

metric which is t-dual to d3-branes at the zzk orbifold singularity. as it is known, in this
case the ak1 ale spaces are t-dual to k parallel ns 5-branes [43].

(i) self-dual d3-branes

as discussed before, in the case of self-dual d3-branes the solutions of the type 0b

supergravity eld equations are the same as in the corresponding type iib theories, namely
they are given by the ads5  x5 background geometries. therefore, also the t-duality
transformation acts precisely in the same way as in the type iib superstring; the n self-

dual d3-branes will become after the t-duality to type 0a n electric plus n magnetic

d4-branes, and the zzk orbifolds are t-dualized into k parallel ns 5-branes. the t-duality
is most conveniently studied using the gibbons-hawking ansatz (5.5) for the metric of the

transversal space. explicitly, the t-duality with respect to the u (1)-isometry generated

22

by the killing vector / (x4-direction) gives with the well-known buscher formula the

conformal at metric of k parallel, extremal ns 5-branes

ds2 = v (~x)(d 2 + d~x2),

b0i = i,

e2 = v (~x),

(5.14)

where the self-duality condition for the original metric is now, in the new axion-dilaton

sector, assuring the condition for an axionic instanton

h = g

.

(5.15)

it is clear that the singular orbifold limit ~xi  0 corresponds to the situation where all
ns 5-branes are stacked on top of each other. finally, putting together the n d4-branes

(in the 01234-directions) intersected by the k ns 5-branes (in the 012389-directions), the

complete ten-dimensional metric is given by the following expression:

ds2 

r2
n

[dxdx + v (~x)dx2

4] +

(ii) electric d3-branes

n
r2 [v (~x)dx2

5,6,7 + dx2

8,9].

(5.16)

the background spaces are now given by the deformed geometries which only approach
in the asymptotic uv region ads5  x5. nevertheless the deformed transversal spaces
y6 still possess the same u (1) isometry direction as before which can be used to perform
the t-duality transformation. therefore, in the t-dual picture the electric d3-branes
will be transformed into electric d4-branes, and the deformed transversal singularities y6
will t-dualize into deformed ve-dimensional ns branes, which only in the uv region are

described by the standard ns 5-brane metric. to be explicit consider again the zzk orbifold
singularity. since its deformation by the functions e and e5 can be best studied using

polar coordinates, the t-duality transformation will be most suitably now also performed

within this parametrisation. for example, t-dualizing the deformed eguchi-hanson metric

(5.13) in the string frame with respect to the isometry direction , the metric for two

deformed, parallel ns 5-branes can be explicitly constructed.

23

6. type 0 hanany-witten constructions

in the last chapter on explicit supergravity solutions we have argued that as in the type

iib superstring one can t-dualize the type 0b d3-branes at transversal singularities into

type 0a d4-branes intersected by a web of ns 5-branes. in case of dyonic d4-branes the

solutions are in fact identical to the corresponding type iia solutions, whereas for purely

electric d4-branes the type iia solutions are only valid in the asymptotic uv region.

using these results we now set up the type 0 hanany-witten [44] rules to obtain

non-supersymmetric gauge theories from d4-branes positioned into a web of ns 5-branes.

dealing with dyonic d4-branes, the non-supersymmetric hanany-witten rules we derive

seem to be completely reliable, since we are condent that the corresponding backgrounds

are indeed stable solutions of the supergravity eld equations. in this case we can even

hope to derive quantum corrections in gauge theories, related to the bending of the ns 5-

branes, via the embedding of the brane congurations into the type 0 version of m-theory.

in fact, many perturbative properties like the -function coecients will not be changed

comparing type ii constructions with dyonic type 0 constructions, as we have already seen

in the previous sections. moreover it is quite conceivable that also non-perturbative duality

symmetries, like seiberg-duality or s-duality, can be carried over from the underlying

supersymmetric type ii gauge theories to the non-supersymmetric type 0 gauge theories

[45]. for example, seiberg duality can be again viewed as a particular motion of the ns

5-branes.

the result that self-dual d3-branes can end on ns 5-branes is also supported by the

recently discussed dualities of type 0a/b [22]. there is was conjectured that the strong
coupling limit of type 0a is m-theory on s1/(1)fss where s denotes the half-shift along
the circle. in [22] is was argued that this implies that the strong coupling limit of type 0b
on an s1 is m-theory on t 2/(1)fss. analogous to type iib this suggest an sl(2, zz) self-
duality of the type 0b, under which the fundamental string is exchanged with the self-dual

d1-brane. by denition a fundamental string can end on a dyonic d5-brane. applying

s-duality leads to a dyonic d1-brane ending on a ns 5-brane. by t-duality along internal

directions of the ns 5-brane one arrives at a self-dual d3-brane ending on a ns 5-brane.

let us consider the simplest ns 5-brane conguration, namely k ns 5-branes in the

(012389)-directions, with suspended d4-branes which stretch along the (01234)-directions.
hence this set up is precisely like the type iia, n =2 hanany-witten congurations, dis-
cussed in [1]. in case of a compact x4 direction (elliptic models) the ns 5-branes are t-dual

24

to the n =2, zzk orbifold singularities. more precisely, the t-dual of n d3-branes at the
zzk orbifold singularities leads to an elliptic hanany-witten construction with an equal

number of n d4-branes suspended between each pair of ns 5-branes. however, we wish

to generalise this picture by allowing also for a dierent number of d4-branes in each 5-

brane interval which corresponds after t-duality to having fractional branes, being partly

wrapped around non-trivial cycles of the geometric singularity. in addition we will also in

general allow for non-compact x4 directions.

the massless spectrum simply follows from the t-duality to the self-dual d3-branes
on the zzk orbifold singularity. alternatively, one can also directly start with the n =2
supersymmetric type iia hanany-witten construction and apply the space-time fermion
number projection (1)fs on the massless n =2 spectrum. at the level of the eective
gauge theories this projection should be equivalent to the modding by the zz2 r-symmetry,

which is discussed in [11]. this projection will not alter the one-loop -function of the

gauge theories.

then, consider k parallel ns 5-branes, and nj d4-branes, being suspended in the x4

direction between the jth and jth + 1 ns 5-brane. in case of non-elliptic models, for j = 0

or j = k the d4-branes are semi-innite to the left of the rst ns 5-brane or, respectively,

to the right of the k th ns 5-brane. the 4-branes are located in x8-x9 plane at the complex

coordinate v = x8 + ix9. the four-dimensional gauge group is given by

g =

k1

oj=1

su(nj) 

k1

oj=1

su(nj).

(6.1)

(for the elliptic models there is one more pair of gauge groups.) the gauge coupling

constants gj of every su(nj) group factor are determined by the dierences between the

positions of the ns 5-branes:

g2
j

j+1  x4

(6.2)

where gs is the string coupling constant. applying the fermion number projection on
the corresponding n =2, type iia spectrum, we obtain massless states in the following

(6.4)

this is precisely the same number as in the n =2 parent models. note, that in the spirit
of [1] this is consistent with the fact that, since the supergravity theory for self-dual d3-

branes is the same as in type iib, the bending of the ns 5-branes in type 0b is the same,

too. thus, also in the type 0b hanany-witten models one can derive the logarithmic

running of the gauge coupling constants from the bending of the ns 5-branes. since the 5-
brane background preserves n =2 space-time supersymmetry, the resulting n =0 spectrum
is automatically anomaly free. we would like to mention that in the case of k = 2 the
two-loop -function coecient of the n =0 theory accidentally vanishes, as well. since
the matter representations for the bosons and fermions are dierent for the n =2 and the
related n =0 gauge theory of course one does not expect to have vanishing n =0 -function
coecient for higher loops, as well.
analogous to the coloumb moduli space in the n =2 gauge theories, the motion of the
dyonic d4-branes in the (89) direction is related to giving vacuum expectation values to
the adjoint complex scalars. since the couplings in the n =0 theory are the truncation of
the couplings in the n =2 theory one has the following commuting diagram:

n = 2
su(k)

hi 6= 0

 n = 2
u(1)k1

(1)fs



n = 0
su(k)2

(1)fs



 n = 0
u(1)2k2

hi 6= 0

26

note that there does not exist further scalars in (6.3) which could describe the breaking
up of a dyonic d4-brane into a d4 and a d4-brane. this is consistent with the fact
that all arguments given for the existence of type 0b hanany-witten models relied on

having dyonic d4-branes. in addition to the coulomb branch there exists also a higgs

branch which corresponds to giving vevs to the bifundamental scalar elds. in this way
a pair of electric or magnetic su(n)2
e,m gauge groups is higgsed to its diagonal subgroup
su(n)e,m.
in the corresponding hanany-witten brane picture this higgs moduli space
is related to the motions of the ns 5-branes, whereas in the t-dual orbifold picture the

bifundamental scalar vevs correspond to the resolution parameters (2-spheres) of the zzk
orbifold singularity. since the electric and magnetic d-branes feel these parameters, which

are related to the orbifold respectively ns 5-brane background, in the same way, it is

plausible that in the eld theory the vevs of the electric and magnetic scalar elds must

be the same such that the electric and magnetic gauge groups are higgsed simultaneously.

it is straightforward to generalise the hanany-witten set up of parallel ns 5-branes

to type 0 models which contain several ns 5-branes with dierent kind of orientations. in

particular brane box-models [46] with d5-branes in the (012348) directions which ll boxes

of ns 5-branes in the (012389) directions and of ns 5-branes in the (012345) directions
follow by applying two t-dualities with respect to x4 and x8 on the transversal zzk  zzl
orbifold singularity. these type of gauge theories are in general chiral and potentially lead

to dangerous gauge anomalies.

the orbifolded conifold singularities in eq.(4.2) are t-dual (t-duality in x4 and x8)
to diamonds of ns 5-branes [33]. by rotating the diamonds into certain directions, the
zzk  zzl brane box models are rediscovered. on the other hand, the mirror conifold
geometries eq.(4.6) lead after a single t-duality in x6 to rotated ns brane congurations
[31], namely to hanany-witten models, where electric and magnetic d4-branes, along

the (01236) directions, are suspended between intervals of k ns 5-branes in the original

(012389) directions and l rotated ns 5-branes along the (012367) directions. the spe-

cic ordering possibilities of ns and ns branes correspond to dierent choices of b-eld

background. for k = l = 1, nc nite d4 branes and nf semi-innite d4-branes, one
can easily construct a (non-elliptic) non-supersymmetric qcd type of model with gauge
group su (nc)e  su (nc)m and nf massless, fundamental matter fermions and scalars
plus massless fermions in bifundamental gauge representations.4 as usual, the 1-loop -
function is inherited from the n =1 parent model: b1 = 3ncnf . as discussed in [48], this

4 this non-supersymmetric model and its seiberg-dual was recently discussed in [47].

27

class of brane models is particularly useful to study the seiberg-duality in the correspond-
ing n =1, type iia brane picture by moving an appropriate number of ns or ns-branes
through the d-branes. since the correlation functions in the large n limit of the type 0

models agree with those of their type ii parents, it is very conceivable that carrying out the

same movements of ns-branes in the non-supersymmetric type 0 models corresponds to

a non-perturbative large n seiberg-duality in non-supersymmetric eld theories. indeed,

one can show along these lines that there exists a dual, non-supersymmetric qcd model
with nc = nf  nc and nf = nf .

7. summary

this paper provides a systematic study of non-supersymmetric gauge theories from

electric/magnetic d-branes in type 0 constructions. since these type of models share a
lot of properties with their n =2,1 supersymmetric counterparts from type ii superstrings,
their non-perturbative dynamics most likely exhibit a lot of intriguing features, like certain

kinds of non-perturbative duality symmetries. in addition, we expect that these models in

spite of being non-supersymmetric nevertheless possess very nice renormalization proper-

ties that could make them appealing also from the phenomenological point of view. the ul-

timate hope would be to gain some information about the higher loop and non-perturbative

behaviour by embedding the non-supersymmetric hanany-witten congurations into m-

theory. it would be also interesting to study d3-branes on non-supersymmetric singulari-

ties in greater detail and to nd out to which kind of non-supersymmetric hanany-witten

congurations they are mapped to.
