abstract

we derive a universal thermal eective potential, which describes all possi-
ble high-temperature instabilities of the known n = 4 superstrings, using
the properties of gauged n = 4 supergravity. these instabilities are due to
three non-perturbative thermal dyonic modes, which become tachyonic in
a region of the thermal moduli space. the latter is described by three mod-
uli, s, t, u, which are common to all non-perturbative dual-equivalent strings
with n = 4 supersymmetry in ve dimensions: the heterotic on t 4  s1,
the type iia on k3s1, the type iib on k3s1 and the type i on t 4s1.
the non-perturbative instabilities are analysed. these strings undergo a
high-temperature transition to a new phase in which ve-branes condense.
this phase is described in detail, using both the eective supergravity and
non-critical string theory in six dimensions. in the new phase, supersym-
metry is perturbatively restored but broken at the non-perturbative level.
in the innite-temperature limit the theory is topological with an n = 2
supersymmetry based on a topologically non-trivial hyper-kahler manifold.

1 introduction

in a physical system where the density of states grows exponentially with the energy,

(e)  ekebe ,

(1.1)

there is a critical temperature, 1  t = th = b1, at which various thermodynamical
quantities diverge [1]. in particular, the partition function z and the mean energy u

develop power pole singularities:

z() = z de (e)ee 
u() = 
ln z  (k  1)

+ regular .

(1.2)

an alternative interpretation of the mean energy pole singularity follows from the

identication of the temperature with the inverse radius of a compactied euclidean
time on s1. in this representation, the partition function is given by the (super)trace

over the thermal spectrum of the theory in one dimension less:

ln z = str lnm() .

(1.3)

the pole singularity is then a manifestation of a thermal state that becomes massless

at the critical temperature. thus, the knowledge of the thermal spectrum of the theory
m(), as a function of the s1 radius r = /2, determines the critical temperature
[2][5].

perturbative string theory provides an example of an exponentially growing density
of states, with k in eq.(1.1) equal to the dimension of space-time, and the exponent b1,

and thus the hagedorn temperature, given as a theory-dependent constant in terms of
the string scale ()1/2 [6, 7, 8, 4, 5]. in the picture where temperature is regarded as a

compactication on a circle of radius r, one can exactly construct the partition function

z(r) and identify the state that becomes tachyonic at the critical temperature [3, 5].

this state has necessarily a non-zero winding number n, as perturbative quantum eld

theory is not able to generate a similar critical behaviour. a detailed discussion of this

phenomenon in perturbative string theory will be the subject of the next section.

it is interesting that one can go a long way into the discussion of thermal instabilities

due to non-perturbative string states, and then also, of non-perturbative eld theory

states. the rst observation is that, in n4 = 4 supersymmetric strings1 (or n6 = 2),
the perturbative string states becoming tachyonic above the hagedorn temperature are

(thermally-shifted) bps states that preserve half of the supersymmetries (n4 = 2 or

n6 = 1). in these theories, the masses of non-perturbative bps states are also known

from n4 = 4 supersymmetry [9, 10, 11] and one can identify among them the states

that are able to induce a thermal instability and the critical temperature at which they

become tachyonic. we will develop this argument in section 3, using heterotictype ii

duality [12][15].

notice that considering only those n4 = 4 bps states preserving n4 = 2 supersym-

metries (1/2-bps) is certainly sucient to study thermal instabilities in, for instance,
non-perturbative heterotic strings in space-time dimensions d  6. bps states pre-
serving less supersymmetries only arise in lower dimensions (1/4-bps, with n4 = 1,
for d  5 or 1/8-bps, with n2 = 1, for d  3). in dimension six or higher, it is
expected that thermal instabilities due to n4 = 2 bps states are similar to those of

perturbative winding states, with an entropy growing linearly with the mass. this

statement, as we will see in the following sections, can be checked in six dimensions,

since heterotictype ii duality allows a non-perturbative behaviour on one side to be

turned to a perturbative one on the dual side. in dimensions lower than six, the 1/4-

or 1/8-bps states singularities have to correspond to an entropy growing with the

mass faster than linearly. this statement is supported by the behaviour of black hole

entropy in four and ve dimensions, which follows the area law [16]. in this case, the

temperature is xed and the canonical ensemble does not exist [8]. however, we stress

that the analysis given in this paper is fully general in dimensions greater than (or

equal to) six, while it only applies to 1/2-bps states in lower dimensions.

with this limitation in mind, the main result of this paper is a computation of

the exact eective potential for all the potentially tachyonic states, as a function of
the (universal2) temperature. it reproduces all known hagedorn temperatures for het-

erotic and type ii strings in the appropriate limits. the exact potential has a global

minimum in a domain of the six-dimensional string coupling that includes the pertur-

bative heterotic regime. in this phase, supersymmetry is perturbatively restored, the

temperature is xed, t 1 = q2h and space-time geometry is that of the heterotic

it describes a non-critical string in six dimensions with massless thermal excitations

extending the concept of particles with innite correlation length in nite-temperature

eld theory with a second-order phase transition. on the type ii side, this phase is

characterized by a condensation of ve-branes.

the present paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we recall the aspects of

perturbative strings at nite temperature, which will be used in the non-perturbative

discussion. in section 3, we discuss the temperature modication to the perturbative
and non-perturbative bps spectra in d  1 = 5 and d  1 = 4 dimensions3. section 4
presents the derivation of the eective lagrangian for the potentially tachyonic states,

as a four-dimensional supergravity theory, and the discussion of the minima of the scalar

potential. section 5 provides a detailed discussion of the high-temperature phase found

in perturbative heterotic strings, using the eective supergravity theory. we show that

a linear dilaton is a background of the eective supergravity, we study the structure

of the mass spectrum, the fate of supersymmetry, and consider various limits in this

background. this phase is further discussed in section 6, in the framework of non-
critical strings with nsc = 2 or nsc = 4 superconformal symmetry. we demonstrate
the existence of massless excitations in twenty-eight n4 = 2 hypermultiplets. we

conclude in section 7.

2 perturbative analysis

to construct the thermal partition function of a system of elds, spin-statistics requires
the boundary condition around the s1 circle to be modied according to

(t + 2lr) = (1)la(t) .

under a 2 rotation (l = 1) of euclidean time, bosons (a = 0) are periodic while

fermions (a = 1) are antiperiodic. the generalization to (perturbative) string theory

is dictated by modular invariance. it replaces the above sign with [3][5]

(1)la+nb+ln

for a state with winding numbers l and n along the two non-contractible loops on

the world-sheet torus. here, a and b denote the fermionic spin structures along these

(d  1)-dimensional theory, hence this notation.

two cycles. modular invariance indicates that the parameter  is equal to one for the
heterotic string and zero for the type iia and iib strings4. it can be seen that the
consequence of this phase is to shift the lattice momenta of the s1 string coordinate
according to the rule5 [4, 5]

and to reverse the gso projection in the odd winding number sector.

it turns out that string theories with d-dimensional space-time supersymmetry look
at nite temperature as if supersymmetry were spontaneously broken in d  1 dimen-
sions. indeed, with a redenition of m, a can be identied with the (d dimensional)

helicity operator: q = integer + a/2. then, the states of the thermal theory, viewed as
(d 1)-dimensional, are mapped to those of a supersymmetric theory compactied on
s1, without the temperature spin-statistics factor (1)lq+nb+ln that induces helicity
shifts in the momenta (2.1). explicitly, a state of the latter with momentum, winding

and helicity charges (m, n, q) is mapped in the thermal case to

~q  ~q = ~q  ~e n ,

(2.2)

where the helicity vector ~q is constructed in terms of the left- and right-moving string
helicities ~q = (ql, qr). the vector ~e = (1, 0) in the heterotic string and ~e = (1, 1) in
type ii theories, and the inner product is lorentzian: ~a ~b = alblarbr. note that
q  ql + qr is the helicity operator in d  1 dimensions. the above shift of charges
~p  ~p + ~q ~q
follows from a lorentzian boost, which keeps invariant the combination

and thus preserves modular invariance.

be identied with the contribution of left-movers to the (four-dimensional) space-time

integers for space-time bosons (ns states), and half-integers for space-time fermions

n, the thermal modication of pl dened in eq.(2.2) can be regarded as a shift of m

and q compatible with the (supersymmetric) gso projection. as a consequence, the

spectrum in even n sectors is not dierent in the thermal and supersymmetric cases,

the mass formula for the (lightest) bps fermions, gauge bosons and scalars with even
windings n remains m2 = p 2
l, with m modied as in eq.(2.2), and tachyonic states are
not present. the situation is not the same for states with odd winding number n. in
this case the bps mass formula becomes 1
l +n(n2ql). from the gso
condition p4
i = 1, it follows that the only states that can become tachyonic are
those with n = 1 and ql = 1(= qr for type ii) [5]. they correspond to (d  1)-
dimensional scalars coming from the longitudinal components of the d-dimensional

never generated by a state becoming tachyonic at high temperature. however, as we

will see below, in non-perturbative supersymmetric eld theories such an instability

can arise from thermal dyonic modes, which behave as the odd winding string states.

indeed, in theories with n4 = 4 supersymmetries the bps mass formula is determined

by the central extension of the corresponding superalgebra [9][11] and dyonic eld

theory states are mapped to string winding modes [14, 11]. using heterotictype ii

duality, one can argue that the thermal shift of the bps masses modies only the

perturbative momentum charge m. in both heterotic and type ii perturbative strings,

the thermal winding number n is not aected by the temperature shifts [see eq.(2.2)].

since, in dimensions lower than six, heterotictype ii duality exchanges the winding

numbers n of the two theories, and since the winding number of the one theory is

the magnetic charge of the other, it is inferred that eld theory magnetic numbers are

not shifted at nite temperature. this in turn indicates how to modify the bps mass

formula at nite temperature.

in section 4, we will give an independent argument

based only on spontaneously broken n4 = 4 supersymmetry and the nature of bps

states.

3 string duality and bps spectrum

our goal is to study six- and ve-dimensional string theories with n4 = 4 supersym-
metry, at nite temperature. the heterotic string is then compactied on t 4 and type

ii theories on k3. in six dimensions, there is an s-duality that relates heterotic and

type iia strings. upon compactication to ve dimensions on a circle, type iia and

iib theories are related by a t-duality.

in view of the observation that the thermal spectrum is obtained by the modica-

tion (2.2) applied to the spectrum of the supersymmetric theory with the temperature

replaced by an ordinary circle, we start by describing the supersymmetric bps spec-

trum in ve and four dimensions. the states that can induce a thermal instability are

charged under the kaluza-klein u(1). their mass depends on the temperature radius
r = (2t )1. the mass formula from the heterotic point of view and in h units is

the momentum and winding numbers are now m and , while n is the wrapping number

mentum, while the last two terms correspond to bps (dyonic) strings with tension

(3.5)

where p, q are relatively primes, so that (n, ) = k (p, q). the common divisor k denes
the wrapping of the tp,q string around s1. on the type iia side, q is the charge of the

fundamental string and p the magnetic charge of the solitonic string obtained by wrap-

ping the ns ve-brane around k3. these tp,q strings cannot become tensionless since

they are never associated to vanishing cycles of the internal manifold. consequently,

their tension is always positive and p, q must be non-negative integers. on the other
hand, for  = 0, the heterotic gso projection implies mn  0, while for n = 0 the type
iia projection implies ml  0. more generally, the tp,q string implies that mk  0
[10].

where q is the helicity operator in d  1 = 5 dimensions [see eq.(2.2)]. in fact, this
formula reproduces the perturbative result for both heterotic and type iia theories, as
specied by eq.(2.2). in the heterotic perturbative limit h  0, only the  = 0 = q
states survive, while in the type iia perturbative limit ii  0, only the n = 0 = p
states survive. note that in the general case of a tp,q string with the temperature
deformation, the condition mk  0 becomes mk  1 because of the inversion of the
gso projection.

it follows from eq.(3.6) that if the heterotic coupling h is smaller than the critical

value

c
h =

2 + 1

2

the rst tachyon has (m, n, , q) = (1, 1, 0, 0) and it appears at r = qh/2(2 +

1), which corresponds to the heterotic hagedorn temperature. on the other hand, if
h, the rst tachyon has (m, n, , q) =
the heterotic theory is strongly-coupled, h > c
(0, 0, 1, 0), and the critical radius is r = q2h h = 2qii/2, which corresponds to
the type iia hagedorn temperature. besides the above two would-be tachyons, mass
formula (3.6) leads in general to two series of potentially tachyonic states with m = 1:

(3.7)

p = 1,

q :

p = 2,

q odd :

r =  2  1
r = s 2

t2,q

2 ! 1
qt1,q

,

(3.8)

(which includes the rst heterotic tachyon with p = 1, q = 0). the critical temperature
(2r)1 for each of the states in both series is always higher than the lowest hagedorn

heterotic temperature while, as discussed above, the type iia hagedorn temperature

rst appears when the heterotic coupling exceeds the critical value (3.7).

in order to include type iib strings, we need to discuss ve-dimensional theories at

nite temperature, taking into account the compactication radius r6 from six to ve

dimensions. type iia and iib strings are then related by the inversion of r6. the

extension to four dimensions of the mass formula (3.6) is straightforward. it depends

on three parameters, the string coupling gh, the temperature radii r and r6. it is

convenient to introduce the three combinations

in this expression, the integers m, n, m, n are the four electric momentum and wind-
ing numbers, corresponding to the four u(1) charges from t 2 compactication. the
numbers m, n, m, n are their magnetic non-perturbative partners, from the heterotic

point of view.

the mass formula (3.10) has been dened for heterotic variables. to exhibit the

relation with the type iib theory, we rewrite the above mass formula in terms of type

iia variables (3.3) and perform a t-duality

however, since8

r2 = h tu = 22stu

and r is by construction identical in all three string theories, the mass formula (3.10)
is invariant under the exchanges s  t, s  u and t  u. these operations correspond
respectively to heteroticiia, iiaiib and heteroticiib dualities. the mass formula

will then apply to all three theories, provided s, t and u are dened as in eqs.(3.9),
but in terms of the appropriate variables , r6 and  in each theory.

the ve-dimensional iia formula (3.1) is reobtained by choosing rst m = n = 0,
which removes the second torus, and then taking the limit r6   with h kept xed.
this limit implies m = n = n = 0, and m is identied with  in eq.(3.1).

the ve-dimensional iib theory is obtained by taking m = n = 0 and the limit
6  , which implies n = m = n = 0. we reobtain eq.(3.4) with iib variables,

identical to eq.(3.6) with the same identication.

we stress here that p, q, r are all non-negative relatively prime integers. this follows

this discussion shows that the temperature modication of the mass formula in-

ferred from perturbative strings and applied to the non-perturbative bps mass formula

produces the appropriate instabilities in terms of hagedorn temperature. we will now

proceed to show that it is possible to go beyond the simple enumeration of hage-

dorn temperatures. we will construct an eective supergravity lagrangian that allows

a study of the nature of the non-perturbative instabilities and the dynamics of the

various thermal phases.

4 four-dimensional eective supergravity

in the previous section, we have studied, at the level of the mass formula for n4 = 4

bps states, the appearance of tachyonic states generating thermal instabilities. to

obtain information on dynamical aspects of these instabilities, we now construct the

full temperature-dependent eective potential associated with the would-be tachyonic

states.

our procedure to construct the eective theory is as follows. we consider ve-

dimensional n4 = 4 theories at nite temperature. they can then eectively be de-

scribed by four-dimensional theories, in which supersymmetry is spontaneously broken

by thermal eects. since we want to limit ourselves to the description of instabilities,

it is sucient to only retain, in the full n4 = 4 spectrum, the potentially massless and

tachyonic states. this restriction will lead us to consider only spin 0 and 1/2 states, the
graviton and the gravitino9. this sub-spectrum is described by an n4 = 1 supergravity
with chiral multiplets10.

9the four gravitinos remain degenerate at nite temperature; it is then sucient to retain only

one of them.

10when considering six-dimensional theories at nite temperature, one is similarly led to consider
an n4 = 2 theory with vector and hypermultiplets. we will briey return to this point later in section
4.3.

the manifold g/h of the n4 = 4 vector multiplets naturally splits into a part that
includes the 6r moduli ti, and a second part which includes the innite number n  
of bps states a.

in the manifold g/h, we are only interested in keeping the six bps states za ,
a = 1, 2, 3, which, according to our discussion in the previous section, generate thermal

instabilities in heterotic, iia and iib strings. for consistency, these states must be

supplemented by two moduli t and u among the tis. we consider heterotic and type
ii strings respectively on t 4  s1

truncation of the scalar manifold g/h, which only retains the desired states of n4 = 1
chiral multiplets, we use a z2  z2 subgroup contained in the so(6) r-symmetry of
the coset g/h. this symmetry can be used as the point group of an n4 = 1 orbifold

compactication, but we will only use it for projecting out non-invariant states of the
n4 = 4 theory11 with r + n = 8.

a single z2 would split h = so(6) so(8) in [so(2) so(2)] [so(4) so(6)],

and the scalar manifold would become

at this stage, the theory would have n4 = 2 supersymmetry and the rst three factors
in the scalar manifold are vector multiplet couplings with prepotential f = ist u/x0.
the last one is a quaternionic coupling of hypermultiplets. the second z2 projection

acts on this factor and reduces it to

this is a kahler manifold for chiral multiplets coupled to n4 = 1 supergravity [21].

the second z2 projection also truncates n4 = 2 vector multiplets into n4 = 1 chiral

multiplets.

the structure of the truncated scalar manifold indicates that the kahler potential

can be written as

with

k =  log(s + s)  log(t + t )  log(u + u)

 log y (z +

y (za , za ) = 1  2za za + (za za )(zb zb ).

this choice is a solution to the n4 = 4 constraints. for the s-manifold su(1, 1)/u(1)
 sl(2, r)/u(1), the constraint is

|0|  |1|2 = 1/2.

we have three such manifolds, i = 0, ni = 2 for the moduli t and u, i = , ni = 3 for
the winding states z +

where y has been dened in eq.(4.5). the kahler function, which denes the n4 = 1
supergravity theory, can be determined by directly comparing the gravitino mass terms
in the n4 = 1 lagrangian with the similar term obtained after z2  z2 truncation of
the n4 = 4 theory:

the structure constants fijk and f ijk characterize the self-couplings of the n4 = 4 vector
multiplets. in this sense, they dene the gauging of the n4 = 4 theory [19, 22, 23, 24].

they induce a scalar potential that can, when appropriately chosen, spontaneously

break supersymmetry [5].

the solutions (4.7), (4.9) and (4.10) to the n4 = 4 constraints indicate that the
non-analytic contribution to the gravitino mass (4.11) is [(s + s)yt u y+y]1/2. this
is identied with ek/2 and leads to the expression (4.4) of the n4 = 1 kahler potential.

the contributions proportional to 01 = (s +s)1/2 give rise to the perturbative t 2
heterotic string spectrum, provided the numerical coecients m1, m2, n1, n2 are equal

to the momentum and winding charges [22, 5]. these contributions dene the structure
constants fijk in eq.(4.11). the contributions proportional to 0 + 1 = s(s + s)1/2
provide the mass spectrum of the non-perturbative magnetic t 2 torus, and correspond
to the structure constants fijk. this superpotential summarizes the complete bps mass

14

spectrum valid for all (truncated) n4 = 4 strings (heterotic, type iia and type iib). it

is worth recalling that the expression of the superpotential, together with the kahler

potential k, denes not only mass terms, but the full scalar sector and its coupling

to n4 = 1 supergravity. this allows to examine in principle the vacuum structure far

from large (or small) values of s + s.

the superpotential (4.12) does not, however, break supersymmetry and is not ap-

propriate to a nite-temperature theory.

in general, breaking n4 = 4 supergravity

requires a gauging with non-zero structure constants cubic in the compensating elds
1,2
0+. the appropriate nite-temperature gauging can be found either in eld theory
from the n4 = 4 thermal spectrum or by examining the heterotic string spectrum at

nite temperature, which corresponds to the scherkschwarz gauging [23, 24, 5]. the

result is to add

w = e(0  1)(1

0 + 1

0)1

+1


(4.13)

to wsusy. the numerical coecient e is xed by the thermal mass of the gravitino. in

addition, the coecient m1 is shifted at nite temperature, according to the rule (2.2)

discussed in section 2. inserting the representation of the scalar eld, and truncating

the spectrum to retain only the odd winding states, we nd the superpotential

w = 22(cid:20) 1

a z +

a )(1  zb zb )

1 z1 + suz +

3 z3 (cid:21).

(4.14)

as a check, the same result can be derived at the n4 = 2 level, considering a

single z2 truncation of the n4 = 4 theory. the vector multiplets ate s, t and u with
manifold [sl(2, r)/u(1)]3 with prepotential [25, 26]

f (s, t, u) = i

st u
x0

,

(4.15)

where x0 is the compensating scalar in the (superconformal) vector multiplet describing

the n4 = 2 graviphoton. the superpotential in n4 = 1 language has the general form

[27]

w = (mix i  nifi)i

+i


,

fi =


x i f ,

with a numerical constant . the index i runs over x 0, s, t and u. after perform-
ing the algebra, we take the poincare gauge x 0 = 1. the part of the superpotential
that leaves supersymmetry unbroken corresponds to the a

terms in i

. they

provide the entire bps mass terms, electric and magnetic. the compensator contri-
butions i

(i = 1, 2) provide the desired breaking terms and correspond to w ,

+i


eq.(4.13). the n4 = 2 formulation can be useful to examine the nite temperature

non-perturbative behaviour of theories based upon more general prepotentials than

(4.15), such as k3 compactications of heterotic strings or calabiyau threefolds of

type ii strings.

4.1 the scalar potential

we now analyse the thermal eective potential and its instabilities. it follows from

the general expression of n4 = 1 supergravity coupled to chiral multiplets, for a given

kahler potential k and superpotential w .

positivity of the kinetic energies and the form of the kahler potential (4.4) impose

that s, t, u > 0, as well as non-trivial conditions on za . in particular,

(re za )2 < 1.

xa

the scalar potential12

v = 4ek h(k1)i

j(wi + w ki)(w j + w k j)  3|w|2i ,

is of course complicated. it can, however, be written in a closed form, which is given in
the appendix. from the analysis of the mass matrices around the vacuum za = 0, it
is apparent that the discussion of thermal instabilities and of possible phase transitions

only relies upon the scalar eld directions

s = re s,

t = re t,

u = re u,

(4.16)

and, in the winding modes sector,

re z +

a = re za  za.

important simplications in the potential occur then. for instance, the winding mode

kahler metric becomes diagonal:

(k)a

(4.17)

4.2 phase structure of the thermal eective theory

the scalar potential (4.20) derived from our eective supergravity possesses four dif-

ferent phases corresponding to specic regions of the s, t and u moduli space. their

boundaries are dened by critical values of the moduli s, t, and u (or of i, i = 1, 2, 3),

or equivalently by critical values of the temperature, the (four-dimensional) string cou-

pling and the compactication radius r6. these four phases are:

1. the low-temperature phase:

t < (2  1)1/2/(4) ;

2. the high-temperature heterotic phase:

t > (2  1)1/2/(4) and g2

h < (2 + 2)/4 ;

3. the high-temperature type iia phase:

t > (2  1)1/2/(4) , g2

4. the high-temperature type iib phase:

t > (2  1)1/2/(4) , g2

h > (2 + 2)/4 and r6 > qh ;
h > (2 + 2)/4 and r6 < qh .

the distinction between phases 3 and 4 is, however, somewhat academic, since there

is no phase boundary at r6 = qh .

4.2.1 low-temperature phase

this phase, which is common to all three strings, is characterized by

h1 = h2 = h3 = 0,

v1 = v2 = v3 = 0.

(4.22)

the potential vanishes for all values of the moduli s, t and u, which are then restricted

only by the stability of the phase, namely the absence of tachyons in the mass spectrum

of the scalars hi. this mass spectrum is analysed in detail in the appendix. this leads

to:

1 > h = (2 + 1)2,

2 > a = 4,

3 > b = 4.

(4.23)

from the above condition, it follows in particular that the temperature must verify

t =

1

2   1

123!1/4

(2  1)1/2

4

.

<

(4.24)

18

since the (four-dimensional) string couplings are
t = 2g2
a ,

s = 2g2
h ,

u = 2g2
b ,

this phase exists in the perturbative regime of all three strings. the relevant light

thermal states are just the massless modes of the ve-dimensional n4 = 4 supergravity,
with thermal mass scaling like 1/r  t .
4.2.2 high-temperature heterotic phase

this phase is dened by

h > 1 >

(4.25)
with h = (2 + 1)2, as in eq.(4.23). the inequalities on 2 and 3 eliminates type ii
instabilities. in this region of the moduli, and after minimization with respect to h1,

2 > 4,

3 > 4,

,

1
h

h2 and h3, the potential becomes

4v = 

1
s

(1 + 1
1  6)2
16(1 + 1

.

it has a stable minimum for xed s (for xed h) at the minimum of the self-dual13
quantity 1 + 1
1 :

1 = 1,

h1 =

1
2

,

h2 = h3 = 0,

4v = 

1
2s

.

(4.26)

the transition from the low-temperature vacuum is due to a condensation of the het-

erotic thermal winding mode h1, or equivalently by a condensation of type iia ns

ve-brane in the type iia picture.

at the level of the potential only, this phase exhibits a runaway behaviour in s. we

will show in the next section that a stable solution to the eective action exists with

non-trivial metric and/or dilaton.

in heterotic language, s, t and u are particular combinations of the four-dimensional
gauge coupling gh, the temperature t = (2r)1 and the compactication radius from
six to ve dimensions r6. the relations are

as expected, 2 and 3 are related by radius inversion, r6  hr1

r6 = (cid:18)2st

u (cid:19)1/2

=

23
[123]1/4 .

(4.28)

the rst equation indicates that the temperature, when expressed in units of the four-

dimensional gravitational coupling constant  is invariant under stringstring dualities.

in terms of heterotic variables, the critical temperatures (4.25) separating the het-

erotic phases are

1 = h :

2t <

h =

1 = 1
h

:

2t >

h =

(2  1),
(2 + 1).

gh

(4.29)

in addition, heterotic phases are separated from type ii instabilities by the following

critical temperatures:

2 = 4,

2ta =

iib :

3 = 4,

2tb =

r6
422

1
2g2
hr6

,

.

(4.30)

then the domain of the moduli space that avoids type ii instabilities is dened by the

inequalities 2,3 > 4. in heterotic variables,

2t <

1

2hg2
h

min (r6 ; h/r6) =

1

422

min (r6 ; h /r6) .

(4.31)

type ii instabilities are unavoidable when t > tselfdual, with

the high-temperature heterotic phase cannot be reached14 for any value of the radius

14from low heterotic temperature.

20

in this case, t <

h always exceeds ta and tb. only type ii thermal instabilities exist in

this strong-coupling regime and the value of r6/qh decides whether the type iia or

iib instability will have the lowest critical temperature, following eq.(4.30).

if on the other hand the heterotic string is weakly coupled,

g2
h <

2 + 1
22

,

(4.33)

the high-temperature heterotic phase is reached for values of the radius r6 verifying
t <
h < ta and t <

h < tb, or
22g2

h(2  1) <

r6

qh

22g2

.

(4.34)

the large and small r6 limits, with xed coupling gh, again lead to either type iia or

type iib instability.

4.2.3 high-temperature type iia and iib phases

these phases are dened by inequalities:

2 < 4

and/or

3 < 4.

(4.35)

in this region of the parameter space, either h2 or h3 become tachyonic and acquire a

vacuum value:

and/or

4v3 =

(4  3)2

163

.

(4.36)

(4.37)

in contrast with the high-temperature heterotic phase, the potential does not possess

stationary values of 2 and/or 3, besides the critical 2,3 = 4.

suppose for instance that 2 < 4 and 3 > 4. the resulting potential is then v2

only and 2 slides to zero. in this limit,

v = 

1

stu4 ,

and the dynamics of    log(stu) is described by the eective lagrangian

le = 

e

22 (cid:20)r +

1
6

()2 

2

2 e(cid:21) .

21

other scalar components log(t/u) and log(s/u) have only derivative couplings, since

the potential only depends on . they can be taken to be constant and arbitrary.
the dynamics only restricts the temperature radius 2r2 = e, r6 and the string
coupling are not constrained, besides inequalities (4.35).

in conformally at gravity background, the equation of motion of the scalar  is

2 = 

6
2 e.

the solution of the above and the einstein equations denes a non-trivial gravitational

-background. this solution will correspond to the high-temperature type ii vacuum.

we will not study this solution further here.

instead, we will examine in detail in

sections 5 and 6 the high-temperature heterotic phase.

4.3 five- and six-dimensional limits

since we have constructed the eective theory of ve-dimensional strings at nite tem-

perature, an appropriate large radius limit should lead to a six-dimensional theory

at nite temperature. there should also be a small radius limit leading to a six-

dimensional theory at nite temperature, since torus compactication implies a radius

inversion symmetry. these decompactication limits should, however, be distinguished

from those on r6 which are taken with xed four-dimensional coupling gh.

the large radius r6, type iia limit keeps the temperature radius r and the ve-

dimensional coupling

xed. it corresponds to

5 = r6g2
g2
h,

t  ,

tu and t/s xed.

(4.38)

on the other hand, the type iib, small r6 limit keeps r and the coupling

xed. it corresponds to

g2
5 =

h
r6

g2
h

u  ,

tu and u/s xed.

(4.39)

in both limits, the inequality that separates heterotic and type ii instabilities is

g2

5 < s h

2

2 + 1

2

.

(4.40)

22

this relation is similar to eq.(4.33) and follows directly from inequalities (4.34). the

analysis of the ve-dimensional nite-temperature mass formula has been done in sec-

tion 3, in terms of the six-dimensional string coupling h. inequality (4.40) is indeed

equivalent to the bound (3.7), by simply dening the dimensionless h, as in eq.(3.2):

h = g2

(4.41)

as mentioned in section 3, the above type iib theory is dened by t-duality from

the heterotic side. it diers from the type iib theory obtained by a t-duality from

type iia [see eq.(3.11)]. the ve-dimensional limit of the latter corresponds to a limit

where the heterotic string coupling h goes to innity. this follows from the duality

relations (3.3) and (3.11) in the type iib decompactication limit

rb
6   with

iib

and

ii

xed.

this takes us outside the bound (4.41), where the non-trivial high-temperature het-

erotic phase is dened. a separate analysis is then needed, which is beyond the scope

of this work.

an alternative type iib theory can, however, be dened directly in ve dimensions

by a t-duality from type iia, reversing the temperature radius:

r 

ii
r

,

ii  iiqii

r

.

the high-temperature heterotic phase xes r = qh or rb = qiiiia in type iia

units. in the above type iib units, this corresponds to b = 1, while the temperature

radius remains undetermined. however, in order to remain in the high temperature

heterotic phase, the bound (4.41) implies

rb <

2 + 1

2 qii .

(4.42)

in the high-temperature heterotic phase, valid in the region (4.41), the temperature

is xed in heterotic units:

thus, in this phase, the only way to change the temperature is by varying the het-
erotic string tension. in particular, the innite temperature limit r  0 is dened by
h  0, which corresponds to the zero slope eld-theory limit of the corresponding
string vacuum. as we will see in the next sections, the latter is described by a non-

critical superstring in six dimensions, whose zero-slope limit contains a nite number

of n4 = 2 massless hypermultiplets. this result supports the conjecture that the high-

temperature phase is described by a topological theory [3]. from the type iia side,

one may in principle take the innite temperature limit by keeping the string tension
xed and sending its coupling to zero. however, this correspond to h  , which
lies outside the domain of validity of the new phase.

another interesting limit is the innite type iib temperature rb  0, with its
string tension xed. from eq.(4.43), this corresponds to a zero temperature heterotic
theory (r  ) with vanishing tension and zero coupling but keeping the product
hh xed. notice the similarity of this limit to the large-n limit in yangmills theory,
2
with the regge slope playing the role of the eective number of degrees of freedom.

this is a non-trivial limit since all genera in principle contribute. we will return to

the above limits in section 6.

5 analysis of the high-temperature heterotic

phase

the thermal phase relevant to weakly coupled, high-temperature heterotic strings at

intermediate values of the radius r6 [see inequalities (4.33) and (4.34)] has an interest-

ing interpretation; we study this here, using the information contained in its eective

theory, which is characterized by eqs.(4.26):

tu = 1,

h1 =

1
2

,

h2 = h3 = 0.

(5.1)

these values solve the equations of motion of all scalar elds with the exception of

s = re s. the resulting bosonic eective lagrangian describing the dynamics of s and

g is

lbos =

.

(5.2)

for all (xed) values of s, the cosmological constant is negative since v = (24s)1
and the apparent geometry is anti-de sitter. but the eective theory (5.1) does not

24

stabilize s.

to study the bosonic lagrangian, we rst rewrite it in the string frame. dening

the dilaton as

e2 = s,

and rescaling the metric according to

and its mass squared is again q2. the same mass shift by the quantity q2 = m2

3/2 will

appear in all scalar masses computed in the linear dilaton background [29].

before turning to the complete analysis of the mass spectrum in the high-tempe-

rature heterotic phase, we now establish the residual supersymmetries expected in the
background chracterized by the linear dilaton dependence on x1.

5.1 broken supersymmetry

the linear dilaton background breaks both four-dimensional lorentz symmetry and

four-dimensional poincare supersymmetry. since supersymmetry breaks spontaneous-

ly, one expects to nd goldstino states in the fermionic mass spectrum and massive

spin 3/2 states. and, because of the non-trivial background, the theory in the high-

temperature heterotic phase is eectively a three-dimensional supergravity.

local supersymmetry in three-dimensional space-time is notoriously dicult to

establish in the presence of massive states. this is because [30, 31] masses induce

26

asymptotically a conical geometry [32], making noether supercharges hard to dene.

supersymmetry of the vacuum does not necessarily imply supersymmetry of the mas-

sive spectrum. this phenomenon exists in (locally) at background and the presence

of the linear dilaton does not simplify the matter. in the following paragraphs, we will

rst consider the existence of goldstino fermions in the high-temperature vacuum, then

compute the mass spectrum, which will turn out to be supersymmetric for moduli t
and u (which are not massless) and perturbative heterotic windings z1 . this super-
symmetry in the spectrum will however be broken in the non-perturbative sector z2
and z3 . finally, by taking the ve-dimensional limit discussed in the previous sec-
tion, we will observe that this non-perturbative breaking of supersymmetry persists,

indicating clearly, in ve dimensions, broken supersymmetry.

to discuss the pattern of goldstino states, observe rst that the supergravity ex-

tension of the bosonic lagrangian (5.2) includes a non-zero gravitino mass term for all

values of s since

m2

3/2 = 2 eg =

notice also for future use that the potential at the vacuum veries

then, consider the transformation of fermions in the chiral multiplet (zi, i) 18:

(5.12)

(5.13)

(5.14)

(5.15)

only the fermionic partner s of the dilaton s participates in supersymmetry breaking,

with the transformation

27

supersymmetries generated by (1  1) are then broken in the linear dilaton back-
ground in the x1 direction while those with parameters (1 + 1) remain unbroken.

starting then from sixteen supercharges (n4 = 4 supersymmetry) at zero temperature,

the high-temperature heterotic vacuum has eight unbroken supercharges. since the

eective space-time symmetry is three-dimensional, the high-temperature phase has

n3 = 4 supersymmetry: the linear dilaton background acts identically with respect to

the n4 = 4 spinorial charges. it simply breaks one half of the charges in each spinor.

thus, the high-temperature phase is expected to be stable because of supersymmetry
of its eective eld theory and because of its superconformal content19.

the pattern of supersymmetry breaking can be conrmed by computing the gra-

vitinos quadratic couplings, which generate the super-higgs phenomenon.

in the

linear dilaton background, the non-kinetic quadratic fermionic terms are:

e1l3/21/2 = q 5 

q

(1 + 1)5s

(5.17)

we then separate the three-dimensional gravitino m, m = 0, 2, 3 from the spinor 1,

with the redenition

m +

1
2

m11  m,

and the gravitino contributions become

q mmn5n 

q

mm(1  1)5s.

these terms identify the goldstino fermion as

g 

1
2s

(1  1)5s,

(5.18)

in agreement with the result (5.16), which indicates that supersymmetries with param-
eter (1  1) are broken.

at the level of the background solution, one would conclude that one half of the

supersymmetries remain unbroken (n3 = 4). we now confront this statement with the

mass spectrum in the scalar and spin 1/2 sectors of the eective supergravity.

5.2 mass spectrum

we now analyse the complete mass spectrum of the eective supergravity theory in

the linear dilaton background relevant to the high-temperature heterotic phase. this

19see next section.

28

spectrum naturally splits in two sectors. first, as already discussed in the previous

paragraph, the heterotic dilaton multiplet, with scalar s and spin 1/2 partner s, is

actively involved in the fate of supersymmetry in the high-temperature phase and in the

background. secondly, all other chiral multiplets play a passive role in these respects.

to simplify the notation, we will in this paragraph collectively denote the scalar elds
t , u, z +

a and za by ya, and their spin 1/2 partners by a.

this splitting of the chiral multiplets arises because in the vacuum dened by
eqs.(5.1), the kahler function g does not induce any mixing of (s, s) with (ya, a)
[see eqs.(5.15)] and supersymmetry breaking is entirely decided in the s sector. the
kahler metric is diagonal, gs

s za = 0, for all values of the elds. in addition,

a = 2g

2

gsa =

syag = 0.

notice, however, that gsab = 3g
to the mass spectrum in the ya sector.

syayb does not vanish: it will generate a contribution

the splitting of s and ya does not exist in the low-temperature phase h1 = h2 =

h3 = 0, in which

gs = (2s)1,

gt = (2t)1,

gu = (2u)1,

(5.19)

with

g =

as goldstino state20. the low-temperature phase is symmetric in the moduli s, t and

u: it is common to the three dual strings, in their perturbative and non-perturbative

domains.

in contrast, the high-temperature heterotic phase only exists in the per-

turbative domain of the heterotic string, where s is the dilaton, and, by duality, in

non-perturbative type ii regimes.

we have already considered the gravitino states and elds of the chiral multiplet

(s = s + ia, s). we now turn to the fermions a and the scalars ya. it is useful to

recall that the kahler metric in the high-temperature phase is diagonal and particularly

20expressed using non-normalized fermions. canonical normalization of the spinors would lead to

(tu = 1),

(a, b = 1, 2, 3).

 fermions a:
the mass matrix of the spin 1/2 partners of t , u, z +

b = m3/2 (g1/2)c

(5.21)

mixings can only arise from non-zero values of gab due to superpotential contributions.
since w includes a term proportional to t uz +
1 z1 , these four elds, which are non-
zero at the vacuum, will get mixed. masses will be completely determined (in m3/2

units) since all parameters are xed in this sector. on the other hand, the two fermion
masses in the z2 sector are m3/2[su  1] and m3/2[st  1] in the z3 sector.
 scalars ya:
the high-temperature vacuum is a minimum of the potential for the scalars ya, va =
v
ya = 0, and also ga = 0, according to eq.(5.15). again, since

2v
sya =

2v

= 0,

at the minimum, the scalar mass matrix splits into mass terms for s and a mass matrix
for the scalars ya, which is given by

comparing with the fermion mass matrix (5.21), one observes that the spectrum would
be supersymmetric21 without the o-diagonal term proportional to 2sw 1w sij. since

supersymmetry breaks in the s direction, these o-diagonal contributions generate

oraifeartaigh-type bosonic mass shifts for states that couple in the superpotential to
s: these are the heterotic dyonic states z2 and z3 , which generate type ii thermal
instabilities. as observed in ref.[5], heterotic perturbative states have a supersymm-

metric spectrum.

these supersymmetry-breaking contributions to the scalar mass spectrum imply the

existence of non-perturbative modes lighter than their fermionic partners. explicitly,

to be compared with the fermion masses |su  1|m3/2 and |su + 1|m3/2. the mass
pattern in the z3 sector is obtained by substituting u for t in the z2 sector.

to summarize, the spectrum is supersymmetric in the perturbative heterotic and
moduli sector (t, u, z1 ), and with oraifeartaigh pattern in the non-perturbative

21in the sense of equal boson and fermion masses.

this phenomenon persists in the ve-dimensional type iia [and type iib] limit
[z2 ] states become superheavy and decouple
[z3 ] scalar masses are shifted by a non-perturbative amount, since in
h]. thus, supersymmetry appears to be broken by
non-perturbative eects. note again, however, that this statement may not hold in

h [st = 1/2

the case of the four-dimensional background solution with a dilaton motion in one

direction. in this case, there is only an eective three-dimensional poincare invariance,

which does not imply in general mass degeneracy within a massive multiplet, even if

local supersymmetry is unbroken [30, 31].

in the special innite heterotic temperature limit discussed at the end of section
4, where h  0, all massive states decouple and consequently one recovers n4 =
2 unbroken (rigid) supersymmetry in the eective (topological) eld theory of the

remaining massless hypermultiplets.

6 the high-t heterotic phase transition

as we discussed in sections 4 and 5, the high-temperature phase of n4 = 4 strings is
described by a non-critical string with central charge decit c = 4, provided the (six-
dimensional) heterotic string is in the weakly coupled regime with h  (2 + 1)/2.

one possible description is in terms of the (5+1) super-liouville theory compactied (at

least) on the temperature circle with radius xed at the fermionic point r = qh . the
perturbative stability of this ground state is guaranteed when there is at least nsc = 2
superconformal symmetry on the world-sheet, implying at least n4 = 1 supersymmetry

in space-time. however, our analysis of the previous section shows that the boson

fermion degeneracy is lost at the non-perturbative level, although the ground state

remains supersymmetric.

an explicit example with nsc = 4 superconformal was given in ref.[33, 34]. it is
obtained when together with the temperature circle there is an additional compacti-

ed coordinate on s1 with radius r6 = qh. these two circles are equivalent to a
compactication on [su(2)  su(2)]k at the limiting value of level k = 0. indeed, at

32

k = 0, only the 6 world-sheet fermionic su(2) su(2) coordinates survive, describing
a c = 2 system instead of c = 6 of k  , consistently with the decoupling of four
supercoordinates, c = 4. the central charge decit is compensated by the linear
motion of the dilaton associated to the liouville eld,  = qx with q2 = 1/(2h) so
that cl = 8h q2 = 4. using the techniques developed in refs.[35, 34], one can derive
the one-loop (perturbative) partition function in terms of the left- and right-moving

degrees of freedom on the world-sheet. namely:

1. the four left- and right-moving non-compact coordinates x (which include the

liouville coordinate) together with the reparametrization ghosts b, c; b, c. their

contribution to the partition function is:

z{x, b, c; b, c} =

im1
2 2 ;

(6.1)

2. the two left- and right-moving coordinates 1, 2 compactied on s1

r  s1
at the fermionic point, r = r6 = qh. by fermionization the currents 1,
2 and 1, 2 are equivalent to four left- and four right-moving world-sheet
fermions i, and i, (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) giving rise to an so(4)leftso(4)right current
algebra. their contribution to the partition function is given in terms of the
so(4)left  so(4)right characters:
z{i, i} =

(6.2)

r6

2 2 2h +h

+g i 

2h +h
+g i ,

where the spin structures , , , , h and g take values 0 or 1.

3. the remaining left-moving degrees of freedom ,  = 1, . . . , 6, are the super-

partners of the coordinates x, 1, 2, and the super-reparametrization ghosts

, . their partition function reads:

z{, , } =

1

4 2h 
 i .

(6.3)

4. the right-moving degrees of freedom also include a conformal system, which can

be described by 28 fermions a, with central charge:

cr[a] = 26  4 (from x)  2 (from 1, 2)  6 (cid:18)from

3

c(cid:19) = 14 .

their contribution to the partition function in terms of so(28) characters is:

z{a} =

1
14 

14h

33

(6.4)

assembling the above conformal blocks, one obtains the partition function of the (5+1)-
dimensional liouville model, with the desired nsc = 4 superconformal symmetry:

(6.5)

this partition function encodes a number of properties, which deserve some comments:

 the initial n4 = 4 supersymmetry is reduced to n4 = 2 (or n3 = 4) because of
the z2 projection generated by (h, g). this agrees with our eective eld theory

analysis of the high-temperature phase given in section 5. the (perturbative)

bosonic and fermionic mass uctuations are degenerate due to the remaining

n4 = 2 supersymmetry.

 the h = 0 sector does not have any massless uctuations due to the linear dilaton
background or to the temperature coupling. the linear dilaton background shift
the bosonic masses (squared) by m2

3/2, so that all bosons in this sector have masses
larger than or equal to m3/2. this is again in agreement with our eective theory

analysis. similarly, fermion masses are shifted by the same amount because of
the s1

r temperature modication.

 in the h = 1 twisted, sector there are massless excitations as expected from

the (5+1) super-liouville theory [36, 37, 34].

 the 5+1 liouville background can be regarded as a euclidean ve-brane solution
wraped on s1  s1 preserving one-half of the space-time supersymmetries (n4 =
2).

 the massless space-time fermions coming from the h = 1 sector are six-dimen-
sional spinors constructed with the  and , . they are also spinors under the

so(4)right constructed using i, and vectors under so(28) constructed with a.

 the massless space-time bosons are in the same right-moving representation
in addition, they are spinors un-

e.g. so(4)right spinors and so(28) vectors.

der so(4)left constructed with i. together with the massless fermions, they

form 28 n4 = 2 hypermultiplets.

34

these 28 massless hypermultiplets are the only states that survive in the zero-slope

limit and their eective eld theory is described by a n4 = 2 sigma-model on a hyper-

kahler manifold. this topological theory corresponds to the innite temperature limit

of the n4 = 4 strings after the heterotic haggedorn phase transition.

although the 5 + 1 liouville background is perturbatively stable due to the nsc = 4
superconformal symmetry, its stability is not ensured at the non-perturbative level

when the heterotic coupling is large:

h(x) = e2(0qx) >
g2

2 + 1
22  0.8536.

(6.6)

indeed, as we explained in paragraph 4.2, the high-temperature heterotic phase only
exists if g2
high-temperature phases. thus one expects a domain wall in space-time, at x0
separating these two phases: g2

h(x) is lower than a critical value separating the heterotic and type ii
 = 0,
)  0.8536. this domain wall problem can be
avoided by replacing the (5 + 1) super-liouville background with a more appropriate
one with the same superconformal properties, nsc = 4, obeying however the additional
perturbative constraint g2

h(x) << 1 in the entire space-time.

h(qx0

exact superstring solutions based on gauged wzw two-dimensional models with
nsc = 4 superconformal symmetries have been studied in the literature [38, 39, 33, 34,
40]. we now consider the relevant candidates with c = 4.

the rst one is the 5 + 1 super-liouville with c = 4, already examined above. it

is based on the 2d-current algebra:

u(1)c=4  u(1)3  u(1)r2=
 u(1)c=4  u(1)3  so(4)k=1.

h  u(1)r2

6=

(6.7)

another class of candidate background is made up of the non-compact parafermionic

spaces described by gauged wzw models:

h sl(2,r)
u (1)v,aik=4 h sl(2,r)
 h sl(2,r)
u (1)v,aik=4 h sl(2,r)

u (1)v,aik=4  u(1)r2=

h  u(1)r2

6=
h

(6.8)

where indices a and b stand for the axial and vector wzw u(1) gaugings.

then, many backgrounds can be obtained by marginal deformations of the above,

preserving at least nsc = 2, or also by acting with s- or t-dualities on them.

35

as already explained, the appropriate background must verify the weak-coupling

constraint:

in order to avoid the domain-wall problem, and in order to trust the perturbative

g2
h(x) = e2 << 0.8536 ,

(6.9)

validity of the heterotic string background. this weak-coupling limitation is realized in
the axial parafermionic space. in this background, g2
h(x) is bounded in the entire

vanishes for asymptotically large values of |z| and |w| (asymptotically at space). this
space has maximal curvature when |z| = |w| = 0. this solution has a behaviour similar
to that of the liouville solution in the asymptotic regime |z|, |w|  . in this limit,
the dilaton  becomes linear when expressed in terms of the at coordinates xi:

 =  re[logz]  re[logw] = q1|x1|  q2|x2|,

(6.13)

where

x1 = re[logz],

x2 = re[logw],

x3 = im[logz],

x4 = im[logw],

and the line element is ds2 = 4(dxi)2. the important point here is that, for large
values of |x1| and |x2|,   0, in contrast to the liouville background in which  =
q1x1 +q2x2, the dilaton becomes positive and arbitrarily large in one half of the space,
violating the weak-coupling constraint (6.9).

we then conclude that the high-temperature phase is described by the above

parafermionic space, which is stable because of n4 = 2 supersymmetry. since it is

perturbative everywhere, the perturbative massive bosonic and fermionic uctuations

are always degenerate, while the non-perturbative ones are superheavy and decouple

in the limit of vanishing coupling.

7 conclusions

in this work we studied string theory at nite temperature t and the issue of hagedorn

transition, using the recent non-perturbative understanding of the theory based on

string dualities. for simplicity, we restricted ourselves to the simplest case of n4 = 4

compactications in d = 6 dimensions, obtained by compactifying the heterotic string
on t 4 or the type ii string on k3. as usual, the thermodynamics can be described by
introducing an additional compactication of the (euclidean) time on a circle of radius

r = 1/(2t ).

in this context, nite temperature boundary conditions correspond

to a particular gauging of the n4 = 4 supersymmetry, while hagedorn instabilities

of dierent perturbative string descriptions appear as thermal dyonic 1/2-bps modes

that become massless (and then tachyonic) at (above) the corresponding hagedorn

temperature.

going to four dimensions and using techniques of n4 = 4 supergravity, we were able

to compute the exact eective potential of all potential tachyonic modes, describing

all three perturbative instabilities of n4 = 4 strings (heterotic, type iia and type

iib) simultaneously. we nd that this potential has a global stable minimum in a

region where the heterotic string is weakly coupled, so that the 6d string coupling
h < (2 + 1)/2. at the minimum, the temperature is xed in terms of the heterotic
string tension (or in terms of the string coupling in type iia units), the four internal

supercoordinates decouple, and the system is described by a non-critical superstring in

six dimensions. supersymmetry, although restored in perturbation theory, appears to

be broken at the non-perturbative level.

on the heterotic or type iia side, the high-temperature limit corresponds to a topo-

logical theory described by an n4 = 2 supersymmetric sigma-model on a non-trivial

hyper-kahler manifold. on the type iib side, on the other hand, the high-temperature

phase corresponds to a tensionless string dened by a limit that generalizes the large-

37

n limit of yangmills theory. it is very interesting to study in detail the properties

of these theories describing the high-temperature phase of string theory, to generalize

these results to other compactications with a lower number of supersymmetries, and

to study possible physical implications, e.g. in cosmology as well as in the case of tev

strings.

appendix

the n = 1 supergravity scalar potential generated by the kahler function (4.4) and

the superpotential (4.14) can be written

v = 4ek (s + t + u + + + ) ,

(a.1)

with

s = |w  2sws|2  |w|2,
t = |w  2twt|2  |w|2,
u = |w  2uwu|2  |w|2,
+ = |w|2 + 1

 = |w|2 + 1

2y wa(wa) + 2|z|2|w  waza|2

+[1 + z2(z2)]|waza |2  |w  waza  z2waza |2.

each of the above quantities is a polynomial in the elds s, t , u, za . the notation is

repeated indices are summed over a, b = 1, 2, 3, y  has been dened in eq.(4.5),

|z|2 = za za ,

z2 = za za

and ek = (8stuy +y )1. expressions (a.1 and (a.2) follow from the kahler function

k only; the structure of the superpotential has not been used. notice also that v
depends on quadratic combinations of the elds za and their conjugates. it is then
invariant under za  za and stationary at za = 0 with respect to these elds.
since v (s, t, u, za = 0)  0, za = 0 is a stable extremum for all values of s, t
and u. we will in this appendix analyse this vacuum, which corresponds to the low-

temperature phase common to the three strings, compare the scalar spectrum with

masses of perturbative string states, and identify the truncation relevant to the study

of thermal instabilities that is used in the body of the paper.

the calculation of the scalar mass matrices is a straightforward exercise, using

gs =

gu =

with g = k + log |w|2. the mass matrix splits into four sectors: z1
(heterotic
winding modes), z2 (iia windings), z3 (iib windings), s, t, u (moduli). as already
mentioned, the moduli sector is trivially massless since the potential at za = 0 is at.

using mass formula (3.12), the eigenstates and their masses can be identied with

(perturbative) heterotic states with momentum and winding numbers m and n:

the rst state is the lowest would-be tachyon at the origin of the heterotic hagedorn

temperatures. the other three states cannot become tachyonic and it is then sucient

to truncate the spectrum to 1

by perturbative heterotic states.

again, using mass formula (3.12), the eigenstates and their masses can be identied
with (perturbative) type iia states with momentum and winding numbers m and m:

1

2 re(z +

2 + z2 ) :

1

2 im(z +

2 im(z +

[su + 4(su)1] , m = 1,
[su + 4(su)1] , m = 1,
m = 0,
[su + 4] ,

m = 1;
m = 1;
m = 1;
m = 1.

the rst state is the lowest potential tachyon and one can truncate the theory to this

direction only for the study of thermal instabilities induced by type iia perturbative

states.

3) z3 :
the scalar mass matrix is obtained by replacing u by t in the z2 mass matrix, as a
result of iiaiib duality. the discussion of the mass spectrum is then similar for string
states with momentum number m and iib winding n. again, thermal instabilities are
generated in the eld direction 1

3 + z3 ) only.

2 re(z +

40

to directions z +

in the body of the paper, we have used, in general, the scalar potential truncated
a ) = (za ) only to enumerate the thermal phases of the
theory. but we have also checked by computing the complete mass matrices that this

a = za = (z +

phase structure is not modied by tachyons arising in other directions in the scalar

eld space.
