abstract

all quartic couplings of scalar elds si that are dual to extended chiral primary op-
erators in n = 4 sym4 are derived by using the covariant equations of motion for type
iib supergravity on ads5  s5. it is shown that despite some expectations if one keeps
the structure of the cubic terms untouched, the quartic action obtained contains terms
with two and f our derivatives. it is shown that the quartic action vanishes on shell in the
extremal case, e.g. k1 = k2 + k3 + k4. consistency of the truncation of the quartic couplings
to the massless multiplet of the n = 8, d = 5 supergravity is proven and the explicit values
of the couplings are found. it is argued that the consistency of the kk reduction implies
non-renormalization of n-point functions of n  1 operators dual to the elds from the
massless multiplet and one operator dual to a eld from a massive multiplet.

1 introduction and summary

the ads/cft correspondence [1, 2, 3] provides a powerful method of studing correlation func-
tions in conformal eld theories, in particular, in d = 4, n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills
theory (sym4). according to the proposal by [2, 3], the generating functional of green func-
tions in sym4 at large n and at strong t hooft coupling  coincides with the on-shell value
of the type iib supergravity action on ads5  s5. thus, the computation of an n-point green
function requires the knowledge of the supergravity action up to the n-th order. in particular,
the quadratic [4] and cubic actions [5, 6, 7] for physical elds of type iib supergravity determine
the normalization constants of two- and three-point green functions [8]-[29]. in principle, by
using the quadratic action [4] and the covariant equations of motion for type iib supergravity
[30, 31, 32] one can easily compute any three-point function of gauge invariant operators in
sym4 in the supergravity approximation, the problem that can be hardly solved in perturbative
sym4 even at the one-loop approximation.

the problem of computing four-point functions [33]-[45] is obviously much more involved,
and consists in general of two independent parts  one rst has to derive the relevant part of
the supergravity action up to the fourth order, and then to nd the minimum of the action that
amounts to computing the corresponding exchange and contact feynman diagrams. however,
as was pointed out in [33], in the simplest cases of massless modes of dilaton and axion elds,
the relevant part of the supergravity action was known. computing the corresponding 4-point
functions was initiated in [33], and completed in [40]. unfortunately, these modes correspond
to rather complicated operators tr ( f 2 +   ) and tr ( f f +   ), and not much seems to be
known about their four-point functions in perturbative sym4. nevertherless, the analysis of the
four-point functions of these operators performed in [45] allows one to conclude that at strong t
hooft coupling all operators with large anomalous dimensions, which are dual to massive string
states, decouple.

the important and simplest operators in sym4 are single-trace 1 chiral primary operators
k = tr ( (i1    ik)). it is well known that all other operators

(cpos) [5] that are of the form oi
in sym4 corresponding to type iib supergravity elds are descendents of cpos.

type iib supergravity on ads5  s5 contains in its particle spectrum [47, 48] scalar elds si
that are mixtures of the ve form eld strength on s5 and the trace of the graviton on s5. at
the linear approximation to the supergravity, namely these scalars correspond to cpos, as one
can see from their transformation properties with respect to the superconformal group of sym4.

1throughout the paper we refer to a single-trace cpo as a cpo. multi-trace operators may also belong to

the same short representation of the supersymmetry algebra as was shown in [46].

1

although the correlation functions of cpos are the simplest ones to compute in sym4, the
corresponding calculation in the supergravity approximation is nontrivial due to the absence of
a relevant action for the scalars si. the quadratic and cubic actions for the scalars si have been
found and used to calculate all three-point functions of normalized cpos in [5].2

to compute four-point functions of cpos one rst has to know all cubic terms that involve
two scalar elds si, and the si-dependent quartic terms, and then to nd the on-shell value of
the supergravity action.

in the present paper as the rst step in this direction we determine all necessary cubic and
quartic terms by using the quadratic action [4] and the covariant equations of motion for type iib
supergravity [30, 31, 32]. it is clear that one can consider only the sector of type iib supergravity
that depends on the graviton and the four-form potential. there are four dierent types of cubic
vertices describing interaction of two scalars si with (i) symmetric tensor elds coming from the
ads5 components of the graviton, (ii) with vector elds, (iii) with scalar elds coming from the
s5 components of the graviton, and (iiii) with scalar elds ti that are mixtures of the trace of
the graviton on the sphere and the ve form eld strength on the sphere. although all the cubic
terms were recently found in [6, 7], we will see that the derivation done in the papers should
be reconsidered. the reason is that this time, since we are interested in cubic corrections to
equations of motion for scalars si, dealing with quadratic terms, we have to take into account
quadratic corrections to equations of motion for the gravity elds.

actually, it is straightforward, although cumbersome, to nd cubic corrections to equations
of motion by decomposing the covariant equations of motion up to the third order, and keeping
only relevant terms. the main problem in deriving the quartic couplings comes from the fact
that the equations of motion such obtained are non  lagrangian, and one should perform a
very complicated and ne analysis to reduce the equations of motion to a lagrangian form. in
particular, although the original equations contain terms with six derivatives, we will show that
one can remove these terms completely by means of a chain of eld redenitions, and by using
nontrivial identities between spherical harmonics of dierent types. even after removing the
terms with six derivatives, the resulting equations containing terms with four and two derivatives
(and without derivatives, of course) are still non-lagrangian. to make the equations lagrangian
one should again redene the scalar elds, and use the identities. since any mistake in the
computation would destroy the possibility of obtaining lagrangian equations of motion, we are

2to get rid of higher-derivative terms in the equations of motion for scalars si a derivative-dependent eld
redenition was made in [5]. by this reason the scalars si used in [5] correspond not to cpos but to extended
cpos involving products of cpos and their descendants [6]. however, three-point functions of the extended
cpos coincide with the ones of cpos for generic values of conformal dimensions of cpos.

2

pretty sure that the quartic couplings we found are correct.

the fact that the covariant equations of motion are non-lagrangian, and one has to perform
nontrivial eld redenitions to reduce them to a lagrangian form, explicitly shows that the
gravity elds entering the covariant equations of motion cannot correspond to any operator in
sym4. the quartic action presented in the next section is in fact written for the scalar elds
si corresponding not to cpos, but to extended cpos, as was discussed in [6]. in principle it
seems possible to nd an action for the scalars dual to cpos by performing the eld redenitions
reversed to the ones used to reduce the equations of motion to a lagrangian form 3. however,
the resulting action for the new scalars will be much more complicated and will contain higher-
derivative terms with six derivatives. its worth noting that the equations of motion derived from
the new action certainly dier from the original ones despite the fact that one made reversed
transformations.

we show that despite some expectations, if we keep the structure of the cubic terms un-
touched, the action obtained contains quartic terms with two and f our derivatives, and there
is no eld redenition allowing one to remove these terms. thus, the problem of computing the
four-point functions of cpos will require computing two new types of feynman diagrams: (i)
exchange diagrams involving massive tensor elds of second rank, and (ii) contact diagrams with
four-derivative quartic vertices. all other necessary diagrams were computed in [36, 40, 41].

in our previous paper [6] we argued that quartic couplings of the scalars si had to vanish
in the extremal case when, say, k1 = k2 + k3 + k4. this conjecture was based on the fact
that all exchange feynman diagrams vanished and contact feynman diagrams had singularity
in the extremal case, thus non-vanishing quartic couplings would contradict to the ads/cft
correspondence. although the vanishing of the quartic couplings obtained in the present paper
is not manifest, we show that this important property does take place after an additional eld
redenition. this means that 4-point extremal correlators of extended cpos vanish, and also
implies the non-renormalization theorem [29] for the corresponding extremal correlators of single-
trace cpos. it is clear that since the quartic couplings vanish then there should exist such a
representation of the quartic couplings, that makes the vanishing explicit. we, however, have
not looked for such a representation yet.

the quartic couplings we found allow us to study the problem of the consistency of the
kaluza-klein (kk) reduction down to ve dimensions.4
it is customarily believed that the
s5 compactication of type iib supergravity admits a consistent truncation to the massless

3note that the reversed transformations should be made at the level of the quartic action, but not at the level

of equations of motion.

multiplet, which can be identied with the eld content of the gauged n = 8, d = 5 supergravity
[51, 52]. consistency means that there is no term linear in massive kk modes in the untruncated
supergravity action, so that all massive kk elds can be put to zero without any contradiction
with equations of motion. from the ads/cft correspondence point of view the consistent
truncation implies that any n-point correlation function of n  1 operators dual to the elds
from the massless multiplet and one operator dual to a massive kk eld vanishes because, as
one can easily see there is no exchange feynman diagram in this case.

2 oi2

2 oin

it is obvious that the cubic couplings found in [6, 7] obey the consistency condition allowing
therefore truncation to the elds from the massless multiplet at the level of the cubic action.
in this paper we show that after an additional simple eld redenition the quartic vertices we
found indeed vanish when one of the four elds is not from the massless multiplet, proving
thereby the consistency of the reduction at the level of the quartic scalar couplings. this in
particular provides an additional argument that the scalars si (and, in general, any supergravity
eld) correspond not to cpos but rather to extended cpos.
indeed, if we assume that the
consistent truncation takes place at all orders in gravity elds, we get that correlators of the
form hoi1
k i vanish for k  3. this is certainly not the case for single-trace
cpos, and we are forced to conclude once more that supergravity elds are in general dual
to extended operators which are admixtures of single-trace operators and multi-trace ones.5
since an extended operator is uniquely determined by a single-trace one, it is natural to assume
that if a correlation function of extended operators vanishes then there exists a kind of a non-
renormalization theorem for an analogous correlation function of single-trace operators. if we
further assume that type iib string theory on ads5  s5 respects the consistent truncation,
then the vanishing of n-point correlation functions of n  1 extended operators dual to the
supergravity modes from the massless multiplet, and one extended operator dual to a massive
kk mode seems to imply that

2    oin1

at large n the n-point functions of the corresponding single-trace operators are independent

of t hooft coupling  = g2

y m n .

if the consistent truncation is valid at quantum level, that seems to be plausible because of
a large amount of supersymmetry, then these n-point functions are independent of gy m for any
n.

in particular this conjecture is applied to n-point functions of n  1 cpos o2 and a cpo

o4. it would be interesting to check this in perturbation theory.

5note that the lowest modes s2 may be dual only to single-trace cpos. it is possible that any eld from the

massless supergravity multiplet is dual to a single-trace operator.

4

we also use the quartic couplings to nd quartic action for the scalars si

2 from the massless
multiplet. the 4-derivative terms vanish in this case, and we arrive at an action with 2-derivative
and non-derivative quartic couplings. we do not compare the action obtained with the one of
the gauged n = 8, d = 5 supergravity on the ads5 background. this problem will be considered
together with the problem of computing 4-point functions of cpos o2 dual to the scalars from
the massless multiplet in a latter paper.

the plan of the paper is as follows. in section 2 we recall equations of motion for the graviton
and the four-form potential, introduce notations, and represent the action obtained. in section
3 we prove that there is the consistent reduction of type iib supergravity on ads5  s5 down to
ve dimensions at the level of the quartic action. in section 4 we show that the quartic couplings
vanish in the extremal case. in section 5 we discuss the structure of the cubic corrections to
the equations of motion due to the contributions of the gravity elds. in section 6 we explain
what steps one should undertake to reduce the equations of motion to a lagrangian form. in
conclusion we disscuss unsolved problems. in appendix a we present the values of the quartic
couplings obtained, and in the appendix b we summarize several important identities involving
spherical harmonics of dierent kinds.

2 quartic couplings

quartic couplings of scalars si may be derived from cubic corrections to the covariant equations
of motion [30, 31, 32] for type iib supergravity. only the graviton and the four-form potential
give relevant contributions to cubic terms. the equations of motion of the metric and the 4-form
potential are

as

gm n = gm n + hm n ; am n p q = am n p q + am n p q; f = f + f.

this gauge choice does not remove all the gauge symmetry of the theory, for a detailed discussion
of the residual symmetry see [47]. as was shown in [47], the gauge condition (2.4) implies that
the components of the 4-form potential of the form a and aa can be represented as follows:

a = b;

aa = 
a.

it is also convenient to introduce the dual 1- and 2-forms for aabcd and aabc:

then the solution of the rst-order self-duality equation can be written as

aabcd = abcdeqe;

aabc = abcdede

the eld redenitions that are needed to make the equations of motion lagrangian and to
remove higher-derivative terms from quadratic terms in the equations of motion will be discussed

3 reduction to the gauged n = 8 5-dimensional super-

gravity

there is much evidence that the s5 compactication of the iib supergravity admits a consistent
truncation to the massless graviton multiplet, which can be identied with the eld content of
the gauged n = 8, d = 5 supergravity [51, 52]. consistency means that there is no term linear
in massive kk modes in the untruncated action so that all massive kk elds can be put to zero.
as was noted in [49, 50] the cubic couplings (2.20)-(2.25) obviously obey this condition allowing
therefore the consistent truncation to the massless gravity multiplet.

in this section we show that after an additional eld redenition the found quartic vertices
(2.26)-(2.30) indeed vanish when one of the four elds is not from the massless multiplet, proving
thereby the consistency of the reduction at the level of the quartic scalar couplings.

recall that the gauged n = 8 ve-dimensional supergravity has in particular 42 scalars
with 20 of them forming the singlet of the global invariance group sl(2, r). these 20 scalars
comprise the 20 irrep. of so(6) and correspond to the iib supergravity elds8 si
k with k = 2.
the ve-dimensional scalar lagrangian consists of the kinetic energy and the potential. the
maximal number of derivatives appearing in the lagrangian is two and that is due to the non-
linear sigma model type kinetic energy. we have however found the quartic 4-derivative vertices
that can not be shifted away by any eld redenition. thus, a highly non-trivial check of the
relation between the compactication of the ten-dimensional theory and the gauged supergravity
in ve dimensions as well of the results obtained involves showing that the 4-derivative vertices
vanish for the modes from the massless multiplet.

we start to analyse the consistency of the truncation with the quartic couplings of 4-derivative
2 belong to the massless multiplet. upon substituting

k2 = k3 = k4 = 2 the couplings (a0)(4)
i1i2,i3i4 turn to zero. the other couplings
are non-zero and, therefore, the only possibility is that their sum should vanish. moreover,
according to the above discussion this vanishing should hold regardless of the fact if the remaing
eld s1 is in a massive or in the massless graviton multiplet.

i1i2,i3i4 and (a1)(4)

among the couplings we consider there is a distinguished one, namely, (at2)(4)

i1i2,i3i4 since it
involves another type of so(6) tensors. to deal with this coupling we note that for k3 = k4 = 2
there exists only two values of k5 for which t345 does not vanish, namely, k5 = 1 and k5 = 3.
then one represents

(f5  1)2t125t345 = (cid:18)(f5  5)(f5  21) + 24(f5  1)  80(cid:19)t125t345,

(3.1)

so that (f5  5)(f5  21) vanishes for both k5 = 1 and k5 = 3. by using relations (9.8) and
(9.9) the remaing terms in the last formula may be now reduced to involve the same type of the
so(6) tensors as the rest of the 4-derivative quartic couplings.

finally, we sum up all couplings assuming that three elds are from massless multiplet and
the fourth one is sj
k . the resulting expression  l4 contains the tensor (aji4i5ai2i3i5  aji3i5ai2i4i5)
as a multiplier9, which for given three elds from the massless multiplet restricts a number of
possible elds si
k to a nite number. namely, k can be equal only to 2, 4, 6. the case k = 6 is
the most simple one, since in this case the only value of k5 for which the tensor does not vanish
is 4. thus, we can extend the summation index over the whole set and use the fact that

xi5

aji2i5ai3i4i5 = xi5

aji4i5ai2i3i5 = xi5

aji3i5ai2i4i5.

(3.2)

hence, for k = 6 the sum of the couplings vanishes.

if k = 4 then there are two possible values of k5: k5 = 2, 4. evaluating  l4 for these values of

k5 we nd

 l4 =

128

3 xk5

(aji4i5ai2i3i5  aji3i5ai2i4i5),

where sum is over k5 = 2 and k5 = 4. thus, for k = 4 the sum  l4 vanishes by virtue of (3.2).

finally we have k = 2 that allows for k5 three values: k5 = 0, 2, 4 and corresponds to the

case when all elds are from the massless multiplet. substituting k = 2 we nd

 l4 =

1

324 xi5

(aji4i5ai2i3i5  aji3i5ai2i4i5)(k5  2)(k5  4)f5(k5 + 6)(k5 + 8).

(3.3)

9we do not assume here a summation over the index i5

10

for these values of k5 the r.h.s. here vanishes identically. thus, we have shown that there is no
4-derivative linear couplings of the massive elds with the massless ones and that the 4-derivative
vertices are absent for elds from the massless multiplet.

the analysis of the couplings of the 2-derivative and non-derivative vertices proceeds in the
same manner. for the so(6) tensors involving vector spherical harmonics one can use the
formula

(f5  1)3t125t345 = (cid:18)(f5 + 23)(f5  5)(f5  21) + 496(f5  1)  1920(cid:19)t125t345

(3.4)

to make the nonreducible part vanishing when three of four elds are from the massless multiplet.
for the so(6) tensors involving tensor spherical harmonics the corresponding representations
look as

5 p125p345 = (cid:18)(f5  12)2 + 24(f5  12) + 144(cid:19)p125p345
f 2

5 p125p345 = (cid:18)f5(f5  12)2 + 24f5(f5  12) + 144(f5  12) + 1728(cid:19)p125p345
f 3

and they are based on the fact that for k3 = k4 = 2 tensor p345 is nonzero only for k5 = 2.

(3.5)

(3.6)

the relevant part of the quartic lagrangian involving two derivatives can be written as

follows

 l2 = xi2,i3,i4

in this section and throughout the paper we often use the following notations

l = a125a345, m = a145a235, n = a135a245,

where we do not assume summation over the index 5.

calculating the coecients in  l2, we see that they have the structure
s = sl  l + sm  m + sn  n, a = an  (n  m)

omitting total-derivative terms, taking into account the symmetry of the coecients in i3, i4,
and using linear equations of motion, one can rewrite this lagrangian in the form

 l2 = xi2,i3,i4
+ (2sm

where

j =

(sm + sn + 2an)  l, l = (an +

(2sl  sm  sn))  l.

computing l we see that l is completely symmetric in i2, i3, i4 for k = 4, 6. after the shift all
2-derivative terms are removed and we get the following lagrangian

 l2 = xi2,i3,i4(cid:16)8sji2i3i4 + (12  m2

k)(jji2i3i4 + lji2i3i4)(cid:17) sj

k si2

2 si3

2 si4
2 .

this lagrangian should be summed up with the non-derivative terms of the quartic lagrangian
whose couplings will be denoted by s(0)
ji2i3i4. thus the complete lagrangian for non-derivative
terms is given by

 l0 = xi2,i3,i4(cid:16)4s(0)

ji2i3i4 + 8sji2i3i4 + (12  m2

k)(jji2i3i4 + lji2i3i4)(cid:17) sj

one can easily check that for k = 6 this lagrangian vanishes, because in this case k5 can be
equal only to 4.

in the case of k = 4 there are two possible values of k5: k5 = 2, 4, and we get at rst sight a

nonzero result which has the form

 l0 = (cid:18) xk(i5)=2

aji2i5ai3i4i5 +  xk(i5)=4

aji2i5ai3i4i5(cid:19)sj

however, now we can use identity (9.5) to show that

xk(i5)=4

taking into account this relation we nd that non-derivative lagrangian  l0 vanishes too.

thus we have shown that at least at the level of the quartic action for scalars si there is
a consistent dimensional reduction of the type iib supergravity to the gauged supergravity on
the ads5 background. we would like to stress again that this reduction requires non-trivial
redenitions of the elds.

now we can compute the quartic couplings for the case when all four elds are from the
massless multiplet. summing up the nonvanishing quartic couplings of the two-derivative ver-
tices we nd out that the answer contains the terms involving the so(6) tensors of the form

12

ai1i3i5ai2i4i5 and ai1i4i5ai2i3i5. integrating by parts it is possible to convert the tensor indices to
the normal order, namely to ai1i2i5ai3i4i5 this also leads to the additional contributions to the
quartic couplings of the non-derivative vertices. recall that k(i5) runs now the set 0, 2, 4.

again it is useful to note that identity (9.5) implies a number of relations between the
in particular, when all the elds are from the

lagrangian terms involving tensors a125a345.

actually there is no sum over k(i5) = 0 since in this case i5 is just the trivial representation.
analogously, multiplying both sides of (9.5) by si1
2 asi4
2 and then integrating by parts
and using the previous relation one obtains the following formula:

xk(i5)=0,2,4

these relations allow one to exclude from the lagrangian for the scalar elds from the massless
multiplet the contributions of the representations i5 with k(i5) = 4.

in this way we nd the following values of the quartic couplings of the 2-derivative vertex

note that the contribution of the trivial representation completely dissappears from the non-
derivative quartic coupling.

the quartic action can be further simplied by substituting the integrals of spherical har-

monics for their explicit value. by using (9.12) one gets

(3.9)

where the shorthand notation c i1i2i3i4 = c i1
i4i1 for the trace product of four matrices
c i was introduced. it remains to note that for k5 = 0 the normalization condition for scalar
spherical harmonics gives pk(i5)=0 ai1i2i5ai3i4i5 = 1
3 i1i2i3i4. by exploting this formula together

with (3.9) the two-derivative lagrangian may be reduced to the following form:

ijsi that provide the natural parametrization of the
one can also introduce the elds sij  c i
coset space sl(6, r)/so(6). although it is clear that namely this form of the action should
be compared to the one of the gauged n = 8, d = 5 supergravity, we will not do this here.
we only note that the comparison requires to perform the eld redenitions of the type si1 
si1 + ji1i2i3i4si2si3si4 to convert the lagrangian terms with two derivatives to the form (3.10).

4 quartic couplings in the extremal case

in our previous paper [6] we conjectured that quartic couplings of scalars si vanish in the extremal
case when, say, k1 = k2 + k3 + k4. in this section we show that the quartic couplings we found
do satisfy the property after an additional shift of the elds. in principle by using the shift one
can nd such a representation of the quartic couplings, that makes the vanishing explicit.

the vanishing of the quartic couplings means that correlation functions of extended cpos
vanish in the extremal case [6] and also implies the non-renormalization theorem [29] for the
corresponding extremal correlators of single-trace cpos.

to prove the vanishing we nd convenient to use dierent 4-derivative vertices. namely, one

can easily show that the following relations are valid on-shell

1234 z s1as22
a(4)

b(s3as4) = 2a(4)

(4.2)

thus we replace all 4-derivative vertices by the ones with only one derivative on each eld. this
representation has also the advantage that in this case the hamiltonian reformulation of the
quartic action is straightforward, and, therefore, as was shown in [16], there is no need to add
boundary terms.

we assume for deniteness that k1 = k2 + k3 + k4. it is easy to show, by using the description
of spherical harmonics as restrictions of functions, vectors and tensors on the r6 in which the
sphere s5 is embedded [5, 6], that the tensors (we do not assume summation over i5 here)

t125t345,

and p125p345

vanish in the extremal case, and that the tensors a125a345, a135a245 and a145a235 dier from zero
only if k5 = k3 + k4, k5 = k2 + k4, k5 = k2 + k3 respectively. thus in all vertices we can replace
k5 by a corresponding function of k2, k3, k4, and, then the only dependence on k5 is in tensors
a125a345, a135a245 and a145a235 which are obviously symmetric in 2, 3, 4.

we single out the eld si1 and write the relevant part of the quartic 4-derivative vertices in

the form

 l(4)
ext = 4 xi2,i3,i4

(cid:18)s(4)

i1i2i3i4  a(4)

i1i3i2i4 + a(4)

i1i4i3i2(cid:19)asi1asi2bsi3bsi4,

where we sum over the representations satisfying the extremality condition. now, we substitute
the values of k5 discussed above, and k1 = k2 + k3 + k4 in the quartic couplings, and obtain zero.

to analyze 2-derivative terms we represent the 2-derivative lagrangian as follows

this time substituting k5 and k1 and symmetrizing the expression obtained in i2 and i4, we
get a non-zero function which is, however, completely symmetric in i2, i3 and i4. thus we can
remove the 2-derivative term by using the shift

to obtain these equations of motion from the covariant equations (2.1) and (2.2) we rst need
to decompose them up to the third order, and then to perform a number of elds redenitions
to make the equations lagrangian. it is convenient to begin by considering quadratic terms in
the covariant equations because as we will see they also give contributions to cubic terms. it is
also useful to single out contributions coming from dierent elds.

5.1 contribution of scalars s

we begin by considering the contribution of the scalars s coming from quadratic terms in the
equations of motion for s that are obtained from the covariant equations (2.1) and (2.2). de-
composing these equations up to the second order in elds, and keeping only terms quadratic in
s, one can represent the equation for s in the following form10

we see that the r.h.s of (5.8) contains terms proportional to linear part of the equations of motion:

reason were neglected in [5], they do contribute to cubic terms. to remove the higher-derivative
terms on the rst line of (5.8) one should make the eld redenition [5]

5.2 contribution of scalars t

to obtain the contribution of the scalars t to cubic terms in the equations of motion for s we
need to decompose the covariant equations (2.1) and (2.2) up to the second order in elds, and
to keep the terms of the form st in the equation for s and terms quadratic in s in the equation
for t. we represent the equations for s and t in the following form

to get rid of the higher-derivative terms in (5.13) we perform the following redenition of the
elds s:

(5.16)

to take into account the terms proportional to the linear part of the equation for t, one should
use eq.(5.14). we also need to reduce eq.(5.14) to the canonical form (5.2). to this end we
perform the shift of the eld t [6]

345as3as4.

this shift removes all terms with derivatives, and we end up with eq.(5.2). finally we make the

125as1as2, then the quartic terms in (5.25) will be

5.4 contribution of massive gravitons

we loosely refer to symmetric tensor elds coming from the ads5 components of the graviton
as massive gravitons. to account for the massive graviton contribution we rst need to derive
equations of motion for the massive gravitons. in principle to obtain these equations one should
consider the einstein equations (2.2) not only with the indices (a, b), but also with the indices
(a, ) and (, ). the reason is that the equations for aab and a
a that are constraints and,
therefore should be a consequence of a true equation, do not follow from (2.2) if one restricts
oneself by considering only indices (a, b). to nd the true equation for the massive gravitons, it
is convenient to replace (2.2) by the following equivalent equation

rm n

3! (cid:18)fm m2...m4f m2...m4

n

gabfm1...m5f m1...m5(cid:19) .

(5.26)

namely this equation one would derive from the usual lagrangian for the metric and the nonchi-
ral ve-form in ten dimensions. an important property of the equation is that after performing

21

the o-shell shift of hab (2.9), its linear part coincides with the linear part of (5.5)

gabfm1...m5f m1...m5(cid:19)(cid:19)(1)

= eqab().

(5.27)

decomposing eq. (5.26) up to the second order in elds, and keeping the terms quadratic in s,
we can represent the equations for ab in the following form

eqab() + 123as1bs2 + 123cas1cbs2 + 123cdas1cdbs2

+ 123(a(bs1s2) + b(as1s2)) + 123(a(cs1bcs2) + b(cs1acs2))
+ 123ab(s1s2) + 123ab(cds1cds2)
+ 123(a(cds1cdbs2) + b(cds1cdas2)) + gabc = 0.

(5.28)

here c denotes the following contribution:

c = t 1

123s1s2 + t 2

l123abcs1abcs2. (5.29)
to remove the higher-derivative and total-derivative terms we perform the following shift of the
massive gravitons:

123abs1abs2 

123as1as2 + t 3

1
2

ab = 3
3

ab + a3

b + b3

a + gab3 + j123as1bs2 + l123cas1cbs2.

(5.30)

here j123 and l123 depend on the coecients , ,  as follows

l123 = 123,

j123 = 123 

1
2

l123(m2

1 + m2

2  f3  18)

and the cubic vertex g123 is expressed through them as

g123 = 123 +

1
2

j123(m2

1 + m2

2  f3  6)  l123(m2

1 + m2

2).

to get rid of the total derivative terms with the coecients , , , ,  one also has to impose
the following relation

1
2

f33

a 

3
4a3 + u123s2as1 + h123cs1cas2 = 0,

(5.31)

where

u123 =

2123),

(m2

(m2

2j123  3m2
1  3)l123 + 123  123.

thus only the coecient  has not been xed yet. actually, a change of the coecient (with the
simultaneous change of  according to (5.31)) results only in a change of the interaction of the

22

trace a
a of the massive graviton with the scalars s. in particular, one can choose  in such a way
that only traceless part of a massive graviton interacts with the scalars s. however, this choice
leads to the appearance of quartic couplings with 6 derivatives. terms with 6 derivatives are
absent only if we choose the cubic vertex as in eq.(2.23). this vertex is a natural generalization
of the interaction vertex of a massless graviton with scalar elds. to determine  we take the
trace of eq.(5.28) and represent the resulting equation as

3
2a(bab  ac

+ 123abs1abs2 + 123abcs1abcs2 + 123s1s2 = 0.

c + 123as1as2

c)  2(f + 3)c

(5.32)

then, by requiring that after the shift (5.30) eq.(5.32) coincides with the trace of (5.5) and
assuming that  has the form

3 = a123s1s2 + b123as1as2 + c123abs1abs2,

we nd the following relations

8h123 + (cid:18)3
8h123(m2

j123  (

33

2  f3)g123.

in particular, one can show that c123 = 0.

to nd the massive graviton contribution to the equations for s we also need to know equa-
a). the simplest way to derive the equations is rst
ab satises eq.(5.5), and then to use the graviton redenition (5.30)

these equations also explain why we took the interaction vertex of massive gravitons in the form
(2.23), namely, there are no terms with derivatives in the r.h.s. of the equation for a
a under
this choice.

now we can proceed with the massive graviton contribution to the equations for s. to nd the
equations we should decompose the covariant equations of motion up to the second order, make

23

the shift (2.9), and keep only the terms of the form s. to simplify the consideration we also
nd convenient not to shift the trace of the original gravitons ha
a (however we do not decompose
hab in the sum of a traceless tensor and a trace) but to take into account the contribution of ha
a
later. this can be easily done because the equation of motion for ha
a follows from the einstein
equation (2.2) with indices (, ). then the equations for s take the form

finally, substituting the massive graviton redenition (5.30) in (5.34), and performing the

however, by using the identities (9.8), (9.9), (9.10) and (9.11) from the appendix, we may
reduce the tensors t125t345 and f5t125t345 to the tensors f n

f5p125p345 to the tensors f n

obtained from them by permutation of the indices 1, 2, 3, 4. then we nd that (after the

are the additional contributions to the coecients w4a and w2a. now we can use the symmetry
of the 4-derivative term and the 2-derivative term under the permutation of the indices 2, 3, and
2, 4 respectively, and identity (9.5) from the appendix to express f5a145a235 and the whole right

thus we reduced all 6-derivative terms to terms which depend only on the tensors f n

5 a125a345.

now summing up the vector elds contribution with the contributions of all the other elds

we get that the term w6c has the following structure

(w6c)1234 = (w6c0)1234a125a345 + (w6c1)1234f5a125a345 

f 2

a125a345,

(6.4)

where (w6c1)1234 is a function symmetric under permutation of 2, 3, and 4, and we denote
 = (k1  1)k1(k1 + 2)(k2 + 1)(k3 + 1)(k4 + 1). thus we may use the identity

w1234f5a125a345 =

1
3

w1234(f1 + f2 + f3 + f4)a125a345,

28

valid for any function symmetric in 2, 3, 4. so, we see that w6c does not depend on the tensor
f5a125a345, and, moreover wc60 should be symmetrized in 2, 3, 4 because it is multiplied by a
symmetric tensor abs2bcs3acs4.

looking at the term w6a we see that this term has the same form (6.4), and moreover, the
coecient w6a1 is also symmetric in 2, 3, 4, and, therefore, can be reduced to w6a0. the term
wa62 proportional to f 2

explicitly

summing up the coecient on the rst line of (6.6) with w6c we obtain that the nal contribution
does not depend on the tensor f 2
5 a125a345. so the new coecient w6c depends only on the tensor
a125a345, and we can easily reduce it to w6a by means of the shift

adding the coecient 2(w6c) from the rst line of the equation to w6a we obtain a new
coecient that is symmetric in 2, 3, and, therefore, the rst term on the r.h.s. of the equation
can be transformed to the structure abs2bcs3acs4 by using (6.3). symmetrizing the
coecient in front of the 6-derivative term we obtain zero. this shift also produces additional
contributions to the coecients w4a and w2a.

thus we have shown that all 6-derivative terms could be shifted away.

29

6.2

4-derivative terms

we proceed with 4-derivative terms for which, we take into account all the additional contribu-
tions appeared in the previous subsection due to our way of working with 6-derivative terms. the
coecient w4a contains the term 16(f51)2
t125t345 that gives lagrangian contribution to the equa-
tions of motion. other contributions are nonlagrangian, and we analyze them by decomposing
the coecients w4a and w4b in laurent series in f5.

these terms give the following contribution to the equations of motion

(2

a  m2

1)s1 = (w4ad)1234as2bs3abs4 + (w4bd)1234s2abs3abs4.

we decompose w4ad into parts symmetric and antisymmetric in 3, 4, and shift its symmetric
part to the 4b-structure by using the eld redenition

s1  s1 + j1234s2as3as4.
the resulting 4-derivative vertices can be written in the form:

it is convenient, however, to reduce the 4-derivative term to the term of 4a-type by means of a
eld redenition of the form,

and by using the symmetry of the 4a-type term under the permutation of the indices 2, 3. the

iv. 4-derivative terms with f5.

we can reduce the 4b-type term to the 4a-type one by means of the shift

the 4-derivative term represents a lagrangian contribution as can be seen by decomposing the
coecients in front of f5a125a345 in parts antisymmetric and symmetric in 3, 4:

(2

a  m2

1)s1 = (y a + y s)1234 f5a125a345as2bs3abs4

it is convenient to get rid of the symmetric in 3, 4 4-derivative contribution by using the following
identity

w1234f5a125a345 =

w1234((f1 + f2 + f3 + f4)a125a345 + f5(a135a245  a145a235)),

thus, we are left only with the antisymmetric 4-derivative lagrangian contribution and the
additional 4a-type terms without f5.

v. 4-derivative terms without f5.

just as above we use the shift

s1  s1 + j1234s2bs3bs4,

j1234 =

1
2

(w4b0)1234,

to get rid of the 4b structure, and take into account the additional contribution coming from the
terms with f5. then we symmetrize the resulting coecient w4a0 in 2 and 3, and decompose it
into parts symmetric and antisymmetric in 3 and 4. then we shift the symmetric part back to
the 4b structure and get the equation

(2

.

both the 4-derivative terms are lagrangian. the antisymmetric term can be derived from
a lagrangian of the form (6.9), and the symmetric term can be obtain from the following
lagrangian

where the quartic coupling s4
interchange (1,2) and (3,4), and is given by

1234 z s1as22

this completes considering 4-derivative terms.

6.3

2-derivative terms

we proceed with 2-derivative terms for which, we should take into account all the additional
contributions appeared because of the shifts used in the previous subsections, and contributions
which appear when one represents the 4-derivative terms as variations of the vertices of the types
(6.9) and (6.12).

the coecient w2a contains four lagrangian terms proportional to

f 2

(f5  1)3t125t345,

(f5  1)2t125t345

and

that can be found in section 2.

we nd convenient to represent the contribution of the other 2-derivative terms in the form

1)s1 = (w2a)1234a125a345as2s3as4
+ (w2b)1234a125a345s2bs3as4,

where the coecients w2a and w2b may depend on f5.

this equation is non-lagrangian, and we again analyze it by decomposing the coecients

w2a and w2b in laurent series in f5.

i. 2-derivative terms with 1/f5.

taking into account all additional contributions we represent the 2-derivative contribution

35

here we decompose the coecient of the 2a type on the antisymmetric a2ad and symmetric
s2ad parts with respect to permutation of the indices 3, 4.

the antisymmetric part is lagrangian and the coecient is given by

(a2ad)1234 =

(f1  f2)(f3  f4)

 (36 + f1 + f2 + f3 + f4  20(k1 + k2 + k3 + k4) + 10(k1 + k2)(k3 + k4)).

the corresponding 2-derivative term can be derived from the following lagrangian

l = a(2)

1234 z s1as2s3as4,

(6.13)

where the quartic coupling a2
interchange (1,2) and (3,4). the equations of motion that follow from the lagrangian are

to remove the terms completely symmetric with respect to permutation of indices 2, 3 and 4
from the equations of motion.

ii. 2-derivative terms with f5.

the consideration of the terms without f5 is simple. we sum up all the additional contributions,
shift the 2b structure to the 2a one, and nally we use a shift to remove the part symmetric in
2, 3 and 4. after these steps we obtain a lagrangian term. as before we shift the symmetric
part to the 2b structure to have a simple lagrangian.

6.4 non-derivative terms

the consideration of non-derivative terms is the simplest one. summing up all contributions we
immediately obtain lagrangian terms for all cases except the case with f5 and without f5. the
equation of motion for the term with f5 has the form

(2

a  m2

1)s1 = q1234f5a125a345s2s3s4.

now we write the equation as

3

(2q1234a125a345 + q1324a135a245) s2s3s4

(6.19)

and then apply the identity (9.5). we get

(6.20)

here the term:

f5
3

(2q1234  q1324  q1342) a125a345

appears to be lagrangian, and the additional term without f5 makes the total contribution to
the term without f5 lagrangian as well.

thus we showed that the equations of motion for the scalars si can be reduced to the

lagrangian form by means of a number of eld redenitions.

7 conclusion

in this paper we derived all quartic couplings of the scalars dual to extended chiral primary
operators in n = 4 sym4 by using the covariant equations of motion for type iib supergravity.
the quartic terms appeared to contain vertices with two and four derivatives. the appearance
of 2-derivative vertices was of course expected. some of the 4-derivative vertices may be removed
by such a eld redenition that changes the structure of cubic terms, namely, one gets scalar
cubic terms with two derivatives, and cubic terms describing non-minimal interaction of two
scalars with vector elds of the form vijkasibsj f k
ab . however, we do not know if all of the
4-derivative terms can be removed in such a way. it would be interesting to clarify this point
because the derivation of the callan-symanzik equations in the ads/cft framework performed
in [53] was based on a gravity action which does not contain terms with four or more derivatives.

since we know the gravity action for the scalars si up to the fourth order, we can start
computing 4-point functions of cpos. in general this will require calculating two new types of
feynman diagrams: (i) contact diagrams with 4-derivative vertices, and (ii) exchange diagrams
involving massive gravitons. it is not dicult to show that all contact diagrams with 4-derivative
vertices can be reduced to a sum of terms corresponding to simple non-derivative quartic cou-
plings, just as this was done in [40] for the case of contact diagrams with 2-derivative vertices.
thus the only real problem is to compute the exchange diagrams involving massive gravitons.
however, the 4-point functions of cpos o2 can be easily found because all necessary diagrams
have been already calculated. this problem is now under consideration.

we proved that, as was conjectured in [6], the quartic couplings obtained vanish in the
extremal case, for which k1 = k2 + k3 + k4. this also implies the non-renormalization of extremal
4-point functions of single-trace cpos. the vanishing of the quartic couplings is not manifest,
and requires an additional eld redenition. although the quartic couplings can be easily used
for computing any 4-point function of cpos, it would be useful to nd such a representation for
the quartic couplings that makes the vanishing in the extremal case explicit.

we showed that the quartic couplings admit the consistent kk truncation, and argued that
the consistency of the kk reduction implies a non-renormalization theorem of n-point functions
of n  1 single-trace operators dual to the elds from the massless multiplet and one single-
trace operator dual to a eld from a massive multiplet. it would be interesting to check the
non-renormalization of the 5-point function of four cpos o2 and one cpo o4 in perturbation
theory.

the simplest example of the 4-point function of three cpos o2 and a cpo o4 belongs,
actually, to the class of so-called next-to-extremal 4-point functions, for which k1 = k2 +

39

k3 + k4  2. the non-renormalization of such correlation functions was proven in [54], and very
recently checked to rst order in perturbation theory in [55]. the non-renormalization theorem
also implies the vanishing of the corresponding functions of extended cpos and, since it is not
dicult to show that there is no exchange diagram in this case, the corresponding next-to-
extremal quartic couplings of scalars si have to vanish too. it would be interesting to check
this.

note added.

we have recently shown that the relevant part of the gauged n = 8 5-dimensional super-

gravity action coincides with the action for the scalar s2 we found in the paper.

8 appendix a

here we collect the quartic couplings of the scalars si representing our main result. the couplings
are given by sums of terms depending on various independent so(6) tensors. to simplify the
presentation we sometimes use the following notations

x  k1,

y  k2,

t  k3, w  k4,

z  k5,

 = (x + 1)(y + 1)(t + 1)(w + 1).

all the so(6) tensors are given by tensors of the form f (f5)ai1i2i5ai3i4i5, (f51)nti1i2i5ti3i4i5 and
f n
5 pi1i2i5pi3i4i5, where f (f5) is a function of f5, and summation over the index i5 is assumed. to
distinguish the couplings with dierent functions f we use an additional subscript in notation
of a coupling.

we need a number of relations between the structure constants a123, t123 and p123, dened as12

a123 = z y i1y i2y i3

in deriving the equations of motions for scalar elds sk and tk and for tensor k
ab one comes
across a number of integrals of scalar spherical harmonics, all of them can be reduced to a123.
introducing the concise notation fi = f (ki) = ki(ki + 4) we present below the corresponding
formulae:

b123 = z y i1y i2y i3 =
c123 = z y i1y i2y i3 =

since any scalar function on a sphere can be decomposed in scalar spherical harmonics, we have
the following relations

y 1y 2 = a123y 3, y 1y 2 = b123y 3, y 1y 2 = c123y 3.

(9.4)

these relations allow one to calculate some integrals involving 4 scalar spherical harmonics. in
particular we have

a1234 = z y i1y i2y i3y i4 = a125a345 = a135a245 = a145a235,
b1234 = z y i1y i2y i3y i4 = a125b345,
c1234 = z y i1y i2y i3y i4 = a125c345,

where the summation over the index 5 is assumed.

there is the following important relation

f5(a125a345 + a135a245 + a235a145) = (f1 + f2 + f3 + f4)a125a345,

(9.5)

that shows that among the three tensors f5a125a345, f5a135a245 and f5a235a145 only the following
two tensors are independent

f5a125a345

and f5(a135a245  a235a145).

we also encounter tensors of the form f n

5 t125t345 and f n

5 p125p345. some of them can be reduced
5 a125a345. to see this we note that any vector and any traceless

to sums of tensors of the form f n
symmetric tensor on a sphere can be decomposed as follows

y 1y 2 = t125y 5
(y 1)y 2 = p125y 5
