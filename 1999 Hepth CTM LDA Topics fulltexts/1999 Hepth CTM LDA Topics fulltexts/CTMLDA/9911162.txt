gymts whatever higgs elds needed placed there, too. total number bosons, vector plus scalar, equal number group generators, rather stringent requirement numbers. fermions placed another irre- ducible representation (irrep) mixed chirality. structure adjoint gauge eld matrix (cid:18) vector bosons scalar bosons vector bosons (cid:19) , scalar bosons (1) (2) fermion eld matrix is: (cid:18) left fermions right fermions right fermions left fermions (cid:19) . possible dimensions blocks make matrices determined maximal subgroups gauge group. assume su(6), three possible maximal subgroups, su(3) su(3) u(1), su(4) su(2) u(1), su(5) u(1). case, example, upper left blocks matrices would square side 3, 4, 5, respectively. original inspiration work old idea due fairlie neeman,4 using su(2/1) unication group glashow-weinberg-salam (gws) model, putting higgs elds adjoint along vector elds. however, spite much eort authors, success achieved time matters. belief gauge group graded1,2 lead insurmountable diculties. possible construct grand unied theory (gut) strong elec- troweak forces using gymt.3 immediate benet procedure simplicity. two terms lagrangian, whereas usual guts several. mentioned, two irreps needed, compared one two fermions, least two higgs elds one gauge vector elds, case usual gut. high energy physics word unication precise meaning: one selects large lie group, contains maximal subgroup small lie groups represent forces unied. then, process spontaneous symmetry breaking brought nonzero vacuum expectation values higgs elds, smaller groups recovered low energy phenomenology. case gymt grand unication process occurring insofar one must choose large lie group contain smaller phenomenological groups, but, besides process, another kind unication, brought putting together one irrep vector scalar bosons (which turns permits put together irrep left right fermions). go second kind unication smaller groups, necessary restrict gauge group maximal subgroup order obtain yang-mills theory familiar terrain, speak. 2 generalized gauge transformation leaves invariant lagrangian theory. however, mean separate parts lagrangian nec- essarily kept invariant transformed individually. example, consider fermion matrix (2), whose chiral structure left invariant gen- eral generalized gauge transformation. maximal subgroup leave chiral structure invariant. fact, dierent maximal subgroups possible yang-mills theories derivable particular gymt. general generalized gauge transformation going help us recover low energy phenomenology, since leads expressions accustomed to. procedure obtain yang-mills theory gymt rst restraining gauge group maximal subgroup; then, usual spontaneous sym- metry breaking processes, obtain small phenomenological groups. shall come back topic last section, relation example covered paper, su(6), discussion abstract. 2 gymts rst thing learn write covariant derivatives spino- rial representation. let element spinor representation lorentz group, that, spinor, transforms s. then, due ho- momorphism exists vector spinor representations lorentz group, a/ sa/s1 vector contracted dirac matrices. homomorphism allowed dirac write spinorial equation included vector electromagnetic eld. following theorem. let = + b, b vector eld. then: (b b)(b b) = 1 8 tr2d/ 2 1 2 trd/ 4, (3) traces taken dirac matrices. going prove theorem. instead, remit reader ref. 1, proof done detail. consider yang-mills theory invariant lie group n generators. fermion matter sector non-abelian lagrangian form id/, covariant derivative chosen maintain gauge invariance, chiral fermion multiplet. multiplet transforms u, u = u(x) element fundamental representation group. covariant derivative = + a, = igaa (x)t element lie algebra g coupling constant. assuming matrices {t a}, = 1, . . . , n, constitute representation group generators. gauge invariance matter term assured or, same, uau 1 (u)u 1 , a/ ua/u 1 (/u)u 1. 3 (4) (5) construct gymt generalize transformation gauge eld follows: every generator lie group choose one gauge eld either vector scalar. suppose n generators lie group;

(12) g5 transforms adjoint 24 su(5); , gws higgs eld, 5; 5; singlet, according branching rule 35 = 10 +56 +56 +240. irreps branching 35 su(6) su(5) u(1) take place irreps normal su(5) gut, dierence gut higgs su(5) transforms another 24 singlet 10. usual gut theory irrep arbitrarily chosen, gymts basically given choice gauge group maximal subgroup. 6 hypercharge generator su(5) gut form diag(2, 2, 2, 3, 3), su(6) case diag(2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 0), (13) assign vector boson b/, way similar way done su(5) gut. (we shall see actually one assign mixture b/ , last scalar proceed introduce.) structure maximal subgroup su(5) u(1) one knows generator z diag(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5). (14) shall give name ultracharge quantum number associated z diagonal generator. necessary assign scalar boson, call , generator, since cannot assign vector boson case already observed, massless. problem assigning scalar eld, for, seen (9), terms would couple scalar bosons among missing. terms drop lagrangian (8) algebraic reasons. scalar one generates large-scale guts masses leptoquark bosons, since bosons available. large mass, since higgs bosons usually assumed masses order vacuum expectation values. normal gut, phenomenology obtained maximal sub- group su(5) sui(2) suc(3) uy (1). branching adjoint 24 = (1, 1)0 + (3, 1)0 + (2, 3)5 + (2, 3)5 + (1, 8)0, (15) irrep given form (m, n)y , sui(2) n suc(3). bosons contained g5 usual four vector bosons gws model, eight gluons, twelve leptoquark bosons. add complex higgs elds scalar singlet obtain 35 elds make gymt adjoint. arrangement seems nicely precise, one serious diculty it. seen branching rule 35, ultracharge bosons zero, that, particular, leptoquarks acquire large mass. propose simple solution problem reminiscent special representation generators u(3) group necessary introduce able express gws model gymt. consists assigning hypercharge generator eld mixture two elds already introduced: = b/ + 5. (16) change eld assigned ultracharge generator; still . assignment leptoquarks (and them) couple , seen (15) hypercharge assignments, obtain large mass. 7 next section study fermion sector model. reader may perhaps nd unlikely scheme introduced could work fermions, rst, mixed eld would apparently imply coupling fermions, giving mass scale grand unication, and, second, that, fermion must couple , must necessarily couple bosons reproduce gws model. actually fermion terms appear serendipitous combination chiralities gives correct results. 5 fermions su (6) su (5) u (1) gymt gut fermions su(6) gymt gut placed antisymmetric 15. branching rule irrep maximal subgroup su(5)u(1) 15 = 54 +102, subindex ultracharge. turn branchings two irreps 5 = (1, 3)2 + (2, 1)3 10 = (2, 3)1 + (1, 3)4 + (1, 1)6 where, before, irreps expressed form (m, n)y , sui(2) n suc(3). two irreps also appear normal su(5), basis isospin, hypercharge, color quantum numbers particle content 5 (d1, d2, d3, ec, c)r 10 (u1, d1, u2, d2, u3, d3, u1c, u2c, u3c, ec)l. quark colors denoted 1, 2 3. possible place two irreps single one, using larger unication groups, two irreps 5 10, charge conjugating 5, order chiralities. however, gymt gut opposite happens: two irreps must necessarily dierent chiralities included larger irrep, that, denoting chirality irrep subindex, 5r 10l need. fermion irreps antisymmetric 15 following way: =(cid:18) 10l 5t r 5r 0 (cid:19) . (17) eld transforms antisymmetrized kronecker product two fundamentals su(6), that, u element fundamental representation, group transformation uu u u 1. furthermore, adjoint product fundamental times conjugate, g6 ug6u 1, correct invariant fermion term gymt lagrangian would need trace gauge group: ftr(cid:0) i(/ + g6)(cid:1) . (18) necessary prove 5 10 predict correct fermion spectrum, since irreps used usual su(5) gut. verify mixed eld causes inconsistencies fermion phenomenology standard model. expanding (18) components, one obtains three types terms: 8 1. type rc/ r lc/ l, c one vector bosons stan- dard model.
