abstract

supergravity solution describing two intersecting m5-branes is pre-
sented. the branes are xed in the relative transverse directions and
are delocalized along the overall transverse ones. the intersection can
be smoothed, so that the m5-branes present one holomorphic cycle.
we also obtain a solution corresponding to an m5-brane on a holo-
morphic cycle of multi-taub-nut space. all these solutions preserve
1/4 of supersymmetry.

1 introduction

besides the problem of nding supersymmetric solutions of supergravity be-
ing interesting in itself, such solutions can be very useful. since branes can
be thought of as solitons of supergravity, corresponding solutions can provide
valuable information about their worldvolume theories. especially interest-
ing would be solutions with branes wrapped on holomorphic cycles, branes
ending on branes and intersecting branes.

after few years of attempts to obtain a supergravity solution correspond-
ing to a pair of intersecting branes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], nding such
a solution of eleven-dimentional supergravity explicitly with all branes fully
localized is still an open problem. in [8] this problem was reduced to solving
a nonlinear equation1 for a kahler metric of the form

gmn + 2mn det gkl = 0.

(1)

the brane congurations that are known explicitly are of two kinds: (i)
those with at least one brane delocalized in its relative transverse directions
[10] and (ii) one in the near horizon limit of a six-brane with another brane
ending on it [11] or localized inside [13]. we should also mention a solution
presented in [3] with two m5-branes intersecting over a string, with both
branes localized in the relative transverse directions. here we are going to
present a somewhat complimentary solution to those mentioned above. in its
simplest version it describes a pair of inersecting m theory 5-branes. these
are localized in the relative transverse directions, but are delocalized in the
overall transverse directions (4, 5, 6), as represented by the following table

where x denotes a direction along the worldvolume of a ve-brane and s
a normal direction along which the ve-brane is smeared. in terms of the
complex coordinates v = y7+iy8 and w = y9+iy10 this m5-brane intersection
is described by

vw = 0.

(2)

this conguration does not satisfy the rules for localized intersections derived
in [12], where a systematic study of localized intersections is performed. the

1solution to this equation as a perturbative expansion is studied in [9].

1

ansatz of [12] assumes some natural symmetries, such as rotational symmetry
in the (7,8) plane. we wold like to point out that our solution does not posess
these symmetries. the reasons for this are geometrical and are similar to the
ones that cause the solution of [11] not to be rotationaly symmetric.

in the framework we are using, one can also describe a resolution of the

singular intersection eq.(2) to a one smooth ve-brane localized at

vw = .

(3)

that is, the ve-brane worldvolume is r4   with r4 parallel to the
(0, 1, 2, 3) directions and  given by eq. (3). and the most general solu-
tion we can obtain describes m theory compactied on taub-nut space
with the  part of the ve-brane worldvolume wrapping an innite two-cycle
of taub-nut or multi-taub-nut.

the answer is given in terms of a solution to a linear equation. namely

the following laplace equation in three dimensions

zzh(z, x) + (z)xxh(z, x) = 0,

(4)

where  is a particular function of z and we allow delta function sources on
the right-hand side.

our construction is based on ideas presented in [13] and [11]. section 2
starts with some mathematical trivia in order to set up our notation. then
we briey describe the construction of hashimoto [11], and how we reverse
it to obtain our results. section 3 consists of the chain of dualities leading to
the nal answer. the last section contains our conclusions.

2 setting

in this section we set up our notation, describe the construction of [13, 11]
and how we reverse it to obtain the intersecting m5-brane solution.

2.1 notation

consider a at four-dimensional space r4 = c2 with coordinates (v, w)

v = ei cos , w = ei sin .

(5)

2

thinking of c2 as a quaternionic space h we form q = vi + wj. we can
write q as q = aei, with a being purely imaginary quaternion (a = a), and
introduce coordinates x7, x8, x9, x10 so that

explicitly

ix7 + jx8 + kx9 = aia, x10 = 2.

x7 = 2 cos(2)
x8 = 2 cos( + ) sin(2)
x9 = 2 sin( + ) sin(2).

(6)

(7)

in terms of these new coordinates the at metric ds2 = 4 (dvdv + dwd w) is

ds2 =

1
r

d~r2 + r (dx10 + ~  ~r)2 ,

(8)

where ~r = (x7, x8, x9) and grad (1/r) = curl (~).

geometrically the three-sphere for a xed distance 2 is a hopf bration
with (2, +) being spherical coordinates of the base s2 and  a coordinate
along the s1 ber. to be more precise these are the coordinates of the
trivialization above the upper patch of s2 (2 < ).
in the lower patch
(2 > 0) the proper ber coordinate is x10 = 2  2( + ) = 2.

we shall be interested in various holomorphic cycles in this c2 space, so

let us consider how they look in the dierent coordinate systems.

a plane

{v = 0} = { = /2} = {x8 = x9 = 0, x7  0},

(9)

an orthogonal plane

{w = 0} = { = 0} = {x8 = x9 = 0, x7  0},

(10)

two intersecting planes

{vw = 0} = { = /2}  { = 0} = {x8 = x9 = 0},

(11)

resolved intersection parameterized by  = ei

{vw = } = { +  = , 2 sin(2) = 2} = {x8 = 2 cos , x9 = 2 sin }.
(12)

in terms of (x7, x8, x9) coordinates these are respectively

3

a semi-innite line starting from the origin,

a semi-innite line in the opposite direction,

a line passing through the origin

a line missing the origin by a distance 2.

taub-nut metric is

ds2 = v (r)d~r2 + v 1(r) (dx10 + ~  ~r)2 ,

(13)

with x10  x10 + 4, v (r) = 1 + 1/r and grad v = curl (~). near r = 0 it
approaches the at space metric of eq. (8). degenerate multi-taub-nut is
a quotient of the above metric by zn : x10 7 x10 + 4/n.

2.2 hashimotos origami

let the coordinates of the eleven-dimensional space of m theory be yi, i =
0, . . . , 6 and v = y7 + iy8, w = y9 + iy10. the solution obtained by akikazu
hashimoto in [11] starts with an m theory ve-brane located at y4 = y5 =
y6 = 0, v = 0. the corresponding supergravity solution is well known and is
invariant with respect to rotation v  eiv as well as w  eiw. in terms of
the new coordinates (6), interpreting x10 as a direction along the m theory
circle , this is a solution of type iia supergravity. in the absence of the ve-
brane the resulting metric (8) is that of a taub-nut space near the origin
of the taub-nut. thus in type iia it is interpreted as a near horizon of a
d6-brane located at the origin. as for the m5-brane, it wraps the m theory
circle, and thus appears (see (9)) as a d4-brane ending on the d6-brane (in
the near horizon limit of the latter).

one can also consider a quotient with respect to the zn action (v, w) 
(exp(2i/n)v, exp(2i/n)w), as presented in [11]. in this case the metric
(8) is that of a multi-taub-nut space with n coincident centers (in the
neighborhood of the centers). thus the resulting iia solution is that of a
d4-brane ending on n coincident d6-branes in the near-horizon limit of the
d6-branes.

2.3 unfolding the origami

in hashimotos picture one m5-brane corresponds to a d4-brane ending on a
d6-brane. let us note, that a pair of intersecting m5-branes (located at zw =

4

0) according to (11) corresponds to a d4-brane piercing the d6-brane. thus
if we were to know the latter solution of iia supergravity (with both branes
being localized), we would be able to reconstruct the eleven-dimensional
solution with two intersecting m5-branes. to be more precise knowing the
solution near the d6-brane allows one to construct two intersecting m5-
branes in at space. the full solution gives an m5-brane on a cycle of taub-
nut space (given e.g. by x8 = x9 = 0) pinched at the origin.

knowing a solution with a d4-brane orthogonal to a d6-brane, with the
d4 localized away from the d6 at some non-zero (x8, x9), would allow one
to write a solution with an m5-brane on a smooth cycle of taub-nut. if we
limit ourselves to the near-horizon geometry of the d6-brane, in m theory
we obtain a smooth m5-brane on a cycle vw =  in at space.

let us also note that a set of n parallel d6-branes pierced by a d4-brane

yields an m5-brane on a cycle of multi-taub-nut with n centers.

even though no explicit solution with both intersecting branes being lo-
calized is known, we can consider one with a d6-brane localized and an
intersecting d4-brane delocalized in the three directions parallel to the d6.
such a solution is reinterpreted in m theory as a pair of intersecting m5-
branes delocalized in the three overall transverse directions (y4, y5, y6). this
situation is somewhat dierent from that considered in [10] and [6], where
the answer is given in terms of two functions: one harmonic and the other is
harmonic in the background of the metric given by the rst one. since the
space transverse to the smeared d4-brane is only two-dimensional and does
not have a positive harmonic function on it this recipe has to be modied.

3 d4 smeared along d6

in order to obtain this solution and check its supersymmetry we shall start
with a iib solution with a d3-brane parallel to a d7-brane and t-dualize
it. the t-duality is performed along the three directions parallel to the d7
and orthogonal to the d3-brane. thus the d3 becomes a d6-brane (fully
localized), and a d7 becomes a d4 delocalized along the three directions
mentioned.

3.1 d3 parallel to d7

let us split the coordinates into those parallel to both branes (with indices
a, b = 0, 1, 2, 3), relative transverse (i, j = 4, 5, 6, 7) and transverse to both
branes (m, n = 8, 9). we start with the following ansatz (in the string frame),
which is a modication of the solution of [14],

ds2 = e/2h 1/2abdxadxb + e/2h 1/2(cid:16)ijdxidxj + dzdz(cid:17) ,

f0123j = jh 1, f0123m = mh 1,
fijk89 = ijkllh, f4567n = nmmh
 + ie =  (z)

(14)

where z = x8 + ix9, h = h(xi, z, z) and

j( (z)) = a +

z

,  = 2(z)2( )2( )(zz)1/12.

(15)

the ve-form f is self-dual with respect to the metric in eq. (14). for f to
be closed the function h(xi, z, z) has to satisfy

zzh + (z)iih = 0.

(16)

the source of the four-form potential a with the self-dual eld strength f is
a d3-brane. thus presence of a d3-brane corresponds to introducing delta
function sources on the right-hand side of eq.(16).

this ansatz is a particular case of the one considered in [16], where the
supersymmetry conditions are also analyzed. now we briey state the results
of [16] specied to our case.

is automatically satised by our ansatz eqs.(14, 15, 16).

condition of eq.(20) cuts supersymmetry in half. even though there
are two equations, the second is satised because of the weyl condition.
condition (21) breaks another half, so one quarter of the supersymmetries is
preserved by our ansatz.

(30)

transformation to conventional spherical coordinates in the (7, 8, 9, 10)
space is given by eq. (7). this solution implicitly depends on two choices.
one is the meromorphic function of z determining j( ) in eq.(15) and the

8

other is positions of the sources of the function h(x, z, z). let us note that
if we pick j( ) to be constant, then  is also constant and

h(x, z, z) = h() +xj

1

q|z  zj|2 + (x  xj)2/

.

(31)

thus we recover a usual multi-taub-nut space. in general in eq. (29) h
denes the background geometry the ve-branes live in. for example, in the
case of h() = 0 a change of the asymptotic conditions that h satises
corresponds to deforming the four-dimensional at subspace of m theory
space to taub-nut (h() 6= 0). allowing multiple sources for h would
produce a multi-taub-nut space. the choice of j( ) determines where the
smeared ve-branes are located as well as the regularization of the metric
on the conical space far away from them2. thus moving the source in the
laplace equation away from the pole of j( ) corresponds to deforming the
intersection to a smooth curve.

approximate solutions to eq.(16) can be found in [18] and [19], where an
elliptic bration over the z plane determined by  is considered and seiberg-
witten coordinates a and ad are introduced so that

da = 2( )z1/12dz, dad =  da.

in terms of these coordinates eq.(16) is

xh = 0,

(32)

(33)

and h can be expanded in the distance away from a taub-nut center.

also, near the ve-brane (small z) 1/z = j( )  e2i and ( )  ei /12.

thus eq.(16) becomes

xh = 0.

(34)

2a d7-brane cannot exist alone, as its dilaton eld becomes innite some nite distance
from the brane. this problem is resolved by introducing nonperturbative seven-branes
parallel to it with corresponding monodromies s or t s of sl(2, z) for example. these
are located at points z where j( (z)) = 0, 1. for similar reasons an m5-brane smeared
along two directions has to be regularized, but we can choose the points z to be far away
from the ve-branes.

9

in case the source of h is at z = 0, which corresponds to the unresolved in-
tersection, it is natural to presume axial symmetry. introducing a coordinate
t such that |z| = et, consider a function f (t, ) which tends to innity at
t  + and satises

4 conclusions

(35)

(36)

we have obtained a supergravity solution describing the intersection of two
m theory ve-branes. the branes are still not fully localized in the directions
transverse to both of them. however, since in our case the problem becomes
linear, this solution might be of use in linearizing the equation of fayyazuddin
and smith [8].

another possibility to x the ve-branes completely might be to start with
a iia solution with a d4 brane xed and d6 delocalized along it. in this
case interpreting it in m theory we obtain a pair of intersecting ve-branes
on a singular space. one might hope to nd a limit of parameters where
the singularity disappears, which would provide the fully localized ve-brane
solution.

a dierent interpretation of this solution is as follows. after compacti-
fying one of the directions the ve-branes are smeared over as the m theory
circle and t-dualizing the other two directions, one obtains an intersection
of two d7-branes. both seven-branes are completely xed then. this inter-
section can be smoothed or put on taub-nut space as well.

the supergravity solution given also describes a ve-brane on a holo-
morphic cycle xed in the directions with nontrivial geometry. we did not
succeed in xing the positions of the branes completely, but we hope that
the solution we presented will help in reaching that goal.
