abstract

we describe the generalization of spherical eld theory to other modal
expansion methods. the main approach remains the same, to reduce a
d-dimensional eld theory into a set of coupled one-dimensional systems.
the method we discuss here uses an expansion with respect to periodic-
box modes. we apply the method to 4 theory in two dimensions and
compute the critical coupling and critical exponents. we compare with
lattice results and predictions via universality and the two-dimensional
ising model.

1 introduction

recently spherical eld theory has been introduced as a non-perturbative method
for studying quantum eld theory [1]. the starting point of this approach is to
decompose eld congurations in a d-dimensional euclidean functional integral
as linear combinations of spherical partial waves. regarding each partial wave
as a distinct eld in a new one-dimensional system, the functional integral is
rewritten as a time-evolution equation, with radial distance serving as the pa-
rameter of time. the core idea of spherical eld theory is to reduce quantum
eld theory to a set of coupled quantum-mechanical systems. the technique
used is partial wave decomposition, but this can easily be generalized to other
modal expansions.
instead of concentric spheres and partial waves, we might
instead consider a generic smooth one-parameter family of (d  1)-dimensional

manifolds (disjoint and compact) and basis functions dened over each mani-
fold. there are clearly many possibilities and we can optimize our expansion
scheme to suit the specic problem at hand.

one important and convenient feature of spherical eld theory is that it
eliminates the need to compactify space  the spherical quantization surface
is already compact. this is useful for studying phenomena which might be in-
uenced by our choice of boundary conditions, such as topological excitations.
another interesting example arises in the process of quantization on noncom-
mutative geometries. spherical eld methods have recently been adapted to
study quantum eld theory on the noncommutative plane [2].
in many in-
stances, however, maintaining exact translational invariance is of greater value
than non-compactness or exact rotational invariance.
in that case one could
consider a system whose spatial dimensions have been compactied to form a
periodic box. the next step would be to expand eld congurations using
free modes of the box and evolve in time. we will refer to this arrangement as
periodic-mode eld theory or, more simply, periodic eld theory.1 the main ad-
vantages of this method is that the hamiltonian is time independent and linear
momentum is exactly conserved. in this work we describe the basic features of
periodic eld theory and use it to analyze spontaneous symmetry breaking in
two-dimensional 4 theory.

the organization of this paper is as follows. we begin with a derivation
of periodic eld theory. we then analyze two-dimensional 4 theory and its
corresponding periodic-eld hamiltonian using diusion monte carlo methods.
we compute the critical coupling at which    reection symmetry is
broken, and determine the critical exponents  and .2 we nd that our value
of the critical coupling is in agreement with recent lattice results [6], and our
values for the critical exponents are consistent with predictions via universality
and the two-dimensional ising model.

we start with free scalar eld theory in two dimensions subject to periodic
boundary conditions

(t,l) = (t, l).

and |0i is the ground state of h0. since h0 is the usual equal time hamiltonian,
|0i is the vacuum. h0 consists of a set of decoupled harmonic oscillators, and
it is straightforward to calculate the two-point correlation functions,

h0|n(t2)n(t1)|0i =

exp [n |t2  t1|] . (8)
we now include a 4 interaction term as well as a counterterm hamiltonian,

2 phase transition

the existence of a second-order phase transition in two-dimensional 4 theory
has been derived in the literature [3][4]. the phase transition is due to  devel-
oping a non-zero expectation value and the resultant spontaneous breaking of
   reection symmetry. it is generally believed that this theory belongs
to the same universality class as the two-dimensional ising model and there-
fore shares the same critical exponents.
in this section we apply periodic eld
methods to 4 theory in order to determine the critical coupling and critical
exponents  and . we have chosen  and  since these are, in our opinion,
the easiest to determine from direct computations. all other exponents can
be derived from these using well-known scaling laws. from the ising model
predictions we expect

 is the exponent associated with the inverse correlation length or, equiva-
lently, the mass of the one-particle state. we will determine the behavior of the
mass as we approach the critical point from the symmetric phase of the theory.
let |ai be any state even under reection symmetry. we consider the matrix
element

(15)

(16)

f (t) = ha| q0 exp (th) q0 |ai .

inserting energy eigenstates |ii satisfying h |ii = ei |ii, we have

f (t) = pi exp (tei)|hi| q0 |ai|2 .

since |ai and |0i are even under reection symmetry and q0 is odd, the vacuum
contribution to the sum in (16) vanishes. in the limit t  , (16) is dominated
by the contribution of the next lowest energy state, the one-particle state at
rest.3 in this limit we have

3we are assuming that this contribution does not also vanish. this is generally true, and

we can always vary |ai to make it so.

where m is the mass. we can compute f (t) numerically using the method of
diusion monte carlo (dmc). the idea of dmc is to model the dynamics of the
imaginary-time schrodinger equation using the diusion and decay/production
of simulated particles. the kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian determines
the diusion rate of the particles (usually called replicas) and the potential
energy term determines the local decay/production rate. a self-contained in-
troduction to dmc can be found in [5].

curve-tting techniques. we have calculated m as a function of  for several
dierent values of l and nmax. results from these calculations are presented
in the next section.

 is the critical exponent describing the behavior of the vacuum expectation
value.
in the symmetric phase the vacuum state is unique and invariant under
the reection transformation    (or equivalently qn  qn, for each n).
in the broken-symmetry phase the vacuum is degenerate as l  , and q0, the
zero-momentum mode, develops a vacuum expectation value.
in the l  
limit tunnelling between vacuum states is forbidden. one ground state, |0+i , is
non-zero only for values q0 > 0 and the other, |0i, is non-zero only for q0 < 0.
we will choose |0+i and |0i to be unit normalized.

let us now dene the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations,

|0si = 12 (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:12)0+(cid:11) +(cid:12)(cid:12)0(cid:11)(cid:1)
|0ai = 12 (cid:0)(cid:12)(cid:12)0+(cid:11) (cid:12)(cid:12)0(cid:11)(cid:1) .

we will select the relative phases of |0i and |0+i so that they transform from

one to the other under reection symmetry.
and antisymmetric (respectively) under reection symmetry.

in this
case the ground state degeneracy is not exact, and the symmetric state |0si is

scales proportionally with the size of system. consequently the average size of
the uctuations must decrease with l. we can estimate the amplitude of the
uctuations, , by assuming a quadratic dependence in  about the local

this agrees with the free eld result in (28) and also appears to be consistent
with the peak widths plotted in figure 2.

let zmax be the location of the non-negative maximum of g(z). since g(z)

less prone to systematic error generated by the o( 1l

the error bounds represent our best estimates of the net error due to statistical,
systematic, and extrapolation inaccuracies.
in all cases statistical errors were
the smallest source of error. next in size were systematic errors arising from
our choice of initial state and time step parameter in the dmc simulations.
for data generated from the mass curves, the main source of error was due to
extrapolation. the extrapolation error for the vacuum expectation value data
was still the most signicant, though considerably smaller than that for the
mass calculations. this reduction is probably a result of the method used to
measure the vacuum expectation value.9 our results for the critical exponents

5 summary

we have discussed the generalization of spherical eld theory to other modal
expansion methods, in particular, periodic eld theory. using periodic eld
methods we have analyzed two-dimensional 4 theory and computed the critical
coupling and critical exponents  and  associated with spontaneous breaking of
   reection symmetry. our value of the critical coupling is in agreement
with a recent lattice calculation, and our values for the critical exponents are
consistent with the critical exponents of the two-dimensional ising model. this
lends support to the popular belief that the two theories belong to the same
universality class.

the full set of diusion monte carlo computations used in our analysis re-
quired about 30 hours on a 350 mhz pc processor. complete codes can be
obtained upon request from the authors. the required computational time
appears to be dominated by the number of operations required to update the
hamiltonian, which scales as n 2
max. errors can be reduced quite substantially
by using larger values of l and nmax and utilizing large-scale parallel process-
ing. no less important, however, is that periodic eld theory provides a simple
and ecient approach to studying non-perturbative phenomena with only mod-
est computer resources. future studies have been planned to analyze phase
transitions in other eld theory models.
