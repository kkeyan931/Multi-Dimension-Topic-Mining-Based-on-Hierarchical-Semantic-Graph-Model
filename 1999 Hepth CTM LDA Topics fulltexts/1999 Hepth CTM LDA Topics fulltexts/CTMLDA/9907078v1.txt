abstract

a hamiltonian analysis of yang-mills (ym) theory in (2+1) dimensions with a level
k chern-simons term is carried out using a gauge invariant matrix parametrization of the
potentials. the gauge boson states are constructed and the contribution of the dynamical
mass gap to the gauge boson mass is obtained. long distance properties of vacuum expec-
tation values are related to a euclidean two-dimensional ym theory coupled to k avors of
dirac fermions in the fundamental representation. we also discuss the expectation value
of the wilson loop operator and give a comparison with previous results.

1. introduction

in recent papers, we have carried out a nonperturbative analysis of yang-mills (ym)

gauge theories in two spatial dimensions in a hamiltonian formulation [1-3]. the use of

a matrix parametrization for the gauge potentials enabled us to derive a formulation in

terms of gauge invariant variables. this framework and the use of some techniques from

conformal eld theory helped to simplify the analysis of the spectrum of the theory, leading

to results on the mass gap and the vacuum wavefunction. a recent analytic calculation of

the string tension gave values within 3% of the values from monte carlo simulations.

in this paper, we extend our gauge invariant hamiltonian analysis to ym theory with

a chern-simons (cs) mass term added, i.e., the ymcs theory.

in particular we shall

focus on how the pure ym results on the mass gap, the vacuum wavefunction and the

expectation value of wilson loop are aected by the addition of the cs term.

it is well known, that the presence of the cs term generates a perturbative mass for the

gauge bosons [4]. the question of interest here is whether and how the perturbative mass

gets augmented or modied by the dynamical generation of mass, which is known to occur

for the pure ym case. our approach to this problem is the construction of gauge invariant

states corresponding to the dynamical gauge bosons and the analysis of the corresponding

schrodinger equation. the situation is essentially analogous to our analysis in the case of

pure ym case.

there have, of course, been many papers analyzing dierent aspects of the ymcs

theory. a particular way of constructing the lower excited states of the ymcs theory has

been given by grignani et al [5]. later we shall comment on the extent to which our results

dier from this work.

in section 2, the reduction to gauge invariant variables is carried out. some of the

eigenstates of the kinetic energy operator are obtained in section 3. section 4 deals with

the inclusion of the potential energy, vacuum wavefunction, screening, etc. in section 5, a

comparison to other recent work is made. the paper concludes with a short discussion.

2. gauge invariant variables for ymcs

we shall discuss an su (n )-gauge theory. the gauge potentials can be written as
,  = 0, 1, 2, where ta are hermitian (n  n )-matrices which form a basis
2 ab. the action for the

a = itaaa

where e is the coupling constant; e2 has the dimension of mass. the parameter k is an

which is convenient for a hamiltonian formulation.

the physical states must obey the condition r a(~x)i a(~x)|i = 0, for functions a(~x)

which vanish at spatial innity. this requirement, along with equations (2-5), will dene

the theory.

3

in carrying out a similar analysis for the pure yang-mills case [1-3] we used a partic-

ular matrix parametrization of the gauge elds, which eventually led to a gauge invariant

formulation. we shall use the same parametrization here, namely

a = m m 1 ,

a = m 1 m 

(6)

where m is a complex sl(n, c)-matrix. the wavefunctions in the a-diagonal repre-
sentation are thus functions of m, m . from (6) it is clear that the gauge transformation
ai  ah
i = haih1ih h1, is expressed in terms of m, m  by m  hm, m   m h1
for h(x)  su (n ). since the gauss law operator in (5) generates gauge transformations,
we see that the gauss law condition is equivalent to

(hm, m h1) =(cid:20)1 +

k

2 z tr(cid:0)m 1 m  + m m 1(cid:1)(cid:21) (m, m )

where h(x)  1 + (x),  = itaa. the general form of the wavefunction obeying (7) can
be written as

(7)

(8)

(m, m ) = exp(cid:20) k

2 (cid:0)s(m )  s(m )(cid:1)(cid:21) (h)

 ei(m,m )(h)

where  is gauge invariant and depends on m, m  only via the gauge invariant combination
h = m m . s(m ) is the wess-zumino-witten (wzw) action for m given by [6]

s(m ) =

1

2 z d2x tr(m m 1) +

i

12 z tr(m 1dm )3

by virtue of the polyakov-wiegmann (pw) identity [7]

s(hm ) = s(h) + s(m ) 

1

 z d2x tr(h1 hm m 1)

(9)

(10)

it is easily checked that (8) is the general solution to the gauss law condition (7).

we have previously calculated the volume measure for gauge invariant congurations

[1,8] as

d(c) = d(h)e2cas(h)

(11)

where c is the space of gauge potentials modulo gauge transformations, d(h) is the
product of the haar measure for h over all space points and ca is the quadratic casimir
for the adjoint representation of su (n ). in calculating the inner product of two states,

4

notice that since the phase  in (8) is real, 

12 = 

12 is gauge invariant. hence the

inner product for two states with wavefunctions of the form (8) is given by

h1|2i =z d(h)e2cas(h)

12

(12)

in computing matrix elements of operators involving e, e, the phase ei does con-
tribute since e, e do not commute with it. we can however use (h) as the wavefunction
of the state (with the inner product (12)) provided every operator o acting on  is rede-
ned as eioei in terms of its action on  s.

in terms of the  s, the corresponding schrodinger equation reads

h(h) = e(h)

(13)

where h = eihei = eit ei + v = t  + v . h can be expressed in terms of the
gauge invariant variable h = m m .

t  =

in arriving at (14) we have used the fact that with the parametrization (6) of the potentials,

we have

where mab = 2t r(tam tbm 1) is the adjoint representation of m .
(similarly hab =
2t r(tahtbh 1) is the adjoint representation of h.) g(~x, ~y), g(~x, ~y) are the greens
functions for the operators  ,  respectively.

xg(~x, ~y) = x g(~x, ~y) = (~x  ~y)
g(~x, ~y) =
g(~x, ~y) =

(x  y)

(16)

where x, y and x, y are holomorphic and antiholomorphic variables respectively. p acts
as the right translation operator on m or h and p as the left translation operator on m 

or h, namely

[pa(~y), m (~x)] = m (~x)(ita)(~x  ~y)
[pa(~y), m (~x)] = (ita)m (~y)(~x  ~y)

5

(17)

pa, pa can be written as functional dierential operators once a parametrization of h is
chosen.

g , g in (14) are the regularized versions of the greens functions g(~x, ~y) and g(~x, ~y).

they have been dened in ref. [2] as

g(~x, ~y) = g(~x, ~y)[1  e|~x~y|2/h(x, y)h 1(y, y)]
g(~x, ~y) = g(~x, ~y)[1  e|~x~y|2/h 1(y, x)h(y, y)]

(18)

as   0, for nite |~x~y|, (g, g)  (g, g). since regularization is needed for calculations
involving t or t  we have included it at this stage.

in deriving (14) the following relations expressing the action of the operators pa, pa

on the wess-zumino actions s(m ), s(m ) were used

pas(m ) = 
pas(m ) = 

i
2

(m m 1)a

(m 1 m )a

(19)

comparing (14) with the corresponding expression for the hamiltonian of the pure

yang-mills case, we see that we can write h as (up to an overall constant)

h = hy m +

(20)

under a parity transformation, h  h 1, p  p, p  p and we see that the term in
(14) or (20) which involves just one factor of p, p violate parity conservation, as expected.
hy m is of course parity-invariant.

the expression (14) or (20) for t  is suitable for analyzing symmetries and for compar-

ison with perturbative analysis, but there is an alternative form which is more convenient

for our purposes. from the denition of the electric eld operators in (2), we see that

(21)

(22)

we can simplify various formulae by dening (h) = exp( 1

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

in terms of s, the inner product is given by

h1|2i =z d(h)e(k+2ca)s(h) 

12

this inner product for the ymcs theory agrees with what is obtained for the pure cs

theory as well [8]. compared to the pure ym case, the essential dierence in the measure
is to replace 2ca by k + 2ca as the coecient of the wzw action s(h).

while expression (25) is self-adjoint with respect to the measure (26), it is not man-
ifestly so. an alternative expression for the kinetic energy operator t can be obtained,
which is manifestly self-adjoint. we can write a general matrix element of t as

h1| t|2i =

e2

2 z d(h)e(k+2ca)s(h)

1 hab eks(h) g pa eks(h) gpb 2

(27)

from previous analysis [2] we found that

using this we can rewrite (27) as

h g pa(~x) , hab(~x)e2cas(h)i = 0

h1| t|2i =

e2

2 z d(h)e(k+2ca)s(h)

1e(k+2ca)s(h)( g p)ahabe(k+2ca)s(h)(gp)b2

7

which leads to a self-adjoint expression for t as

t =

e2

2 z e(k+2ca)s(h)( g p)ahabe(k+2ca)s(h)(gp)b

(28)

the expression for t has the same form as in the pure ym theory [2] except for the
2ca  k + 2ca shift in the coecient of s(h).

in the case of the pure yang-mills case we dened the currents

ja =

ca


hh 1 ,

ja =

ca


h 1 h

(29)

it turned out that these current operators generated the whole spectrum of the theory.

the situation is not exactly the same in the case of ymcs theory as we shall comment

later; however for both ym and ymcs theories, ja plays the role of the nonperturbative
gluon.

the kinetic energy operator can be simplied in the case of s being purely functions

of the current ja, rather than h in general; such a simplication will be useful later in the
evaluation of the vacuum wavefunction. we nd

ty m =

ab(~u, ~v) =

+ z ab(~u, ~v)



j a(~u)



j b(~v)(cid:21)

j a(~u)

2 (cid:20)zu
(u  v)2  i

ab

ca
2

j a(~u)

fabcj c(~v)
(u  v)

we see that the coecient of the r j/j-term is (k + 2ca)e2/4, giving a mass of this
value to every factor of j a, which is consistent with the shift 2ca  k + 2ca.
3. eigenstates of t

in analyzing the schrodinger equation and the eigenstates of the hamiltonian, we

shall follow the strategy we used for the pure yang-mills case, namely, we shall consider

eigenstates of t rst, neglecting the potential energy term v . this is essentially a strong
coupling limit, e2  p, where p is the typical momentum scale. in the next section we
shall see how the eects of the potential energy term can be included.

the commutation rule (3) shows that ea is like an annihilation operator while ea is

like a creation operator. further, since t = 2e2r ea ea, we see that the ground state or

8

vacuum state for t is given by t 0 = 0 with ea0 = 0. this is equivalent to  = 0 =
constant. in other words, upto a normalization constant,

0 = exp(cid:20)ks(m ) 

k

4 z aa aa(cid:21)

(31)

this is normalizable with the inner product (12).

since ea behaves like a creation operator, we should expect that the excited states
can be obtained by successive applications of ea on 0. in particular, the rst excited
state may be expected to be of the form ea0. however, this is not gauge invariant.
gauge invariant combinations are given by eb(~x)m 
ab(~x)eb(~x)0. these
can be evaluated as follows.

ab(~x)0 and m

ab(~x)eb(~x)0 =

(32b)

where we have used the fact that, with proper regularization,

i

2" m

2 ja(~x)

thus, apart from constant factors, both ebm 
(30), we thus have

ab and m 

abeb involve the current ja. from

t (m 

ab(~x)eb(~x)0) =

e2
4

(k + 2ca) (m 

ab(~x)eb(~x)0)

(33)

it is also useful to work through this directly without rst relating it to js. we have

t (m 

ab(~x)eb(~x)0) = 2e2zy

ek(~y)[ ek(~y), m 

ab(~x)eb(~x)]0

=

e2k
4

eb(~x)m 

ab(~x)0

we rewrite this in terms of m e using (32). the above equation then reduces to

t (ja0) =

e2
4

(k + 2ca)(ja0)

9

(34)

(35)

in agreement with (33). if we start with eb(~x)m 
a careful treatment of potential singularities.

ab(~x)0, the same result is obtained with

in the large k, or semiclassical limit, the lowest excited state ja0 has a mass e2k/4
which is the perturbative mass acquired by the gauge boson due to the cs term. ja0
may thus be identied as the state corresponding to a single gauge boson which now has
a mass (k + 2ca)e2/4. it is clear that states with many gauge bosons may be obtained
by a suitable product of many js.

4. potential energy, screening, etc.

we now turn to the inclusion of the potential energy term v = 1

this modies the vacuum wavefunction. in the case of the pure ym theory, this could be
done in a power series in 1/e2 and the resulting series summed up to obtain the vacuum
wavefunction in the form 0 = ep with

2e2 r b2 and how

p = 

22
e2c2

a z ja(cid:18)

1

m + m2  2(cid:19) ja + 3j  terms

(36)

where m = e2ca/2. the 3j-terms involve at least 3 powers of the current ja. such terms
were shown to be subdominant, compared to the 2j-term displayed, for modes of j in the

large and small momentum regimes. for low momentum modes, p simplies and gives

0  exp(cid:20)

1

2me2 z tr b2(cid:21)

(37)

vacuum expectation values are thus reduced to correlators in a euclidean two-dimensional
ym theory of coupling constant g2 = me2 = e4ca/2. the expectation value of the
wilson loop operator then follows an area law. the string tension  was obtained as

 = e2p(n 2  1)/8, which is in very good agreement with monte carlo estimates [9].

in the present case of ymcs theory, the kinetic energy operator has a structure similar

to the pure ym case, viz.,

t = mzu
= m(cid:20)zu

j a(~u)



j a(~u)

a(~u)



a(~u)

+ mz ab(~u, ~v)
+ z ab(~u, ~v)





j a(~u)


j b(~v)


b(~v)(cid:21)

a(~u)

(38)

where m = (k + 2ca)e2/4 and  =p m/m j. the inclusion of the potential energy can

thus be done in a way similar to the pure ym case. for the term with two currents in 0

10

we get 0 = ep , where p is given by (36) with m  m and j  . in other words,

0 = exp(cid:20)
= exp(cid:20)



mca z (cid:18)
mca z j(cid:18)



1

m +  m2  2(cid:19) (cid:21)
m +  m2  2(cid:19) j(cid:21)

1

(39)

for low momentum modes, we also have the approximation (37), again with m  m.
we thus nd |0|2 = es(2)
, where s(2) corresponds to the action of a euclidean two-
dimensional ym theory of g2 = me2 = e4(k + 2ca)/4.

however, we have more than a 2d-ym theory in the evaluation of correlators. the
volume measure for gauge invariant congurations is d(h) exp(2cas(h)). for the ymcs
theory, the inner product as given by (26) involves d(h) exp[(k + 2ca)s(h)]. thus the
vacuum expectation value of an operator o in the (2 + 1)-dimensional ymcs theory can
be written, for long wavelength modes, as

hoi =z d(h)e(k+2ca)s(h) e 1
4g2 r f 2

=z d (c) eks(h)e 1

4g2 r f 2
o

o

(40)

the extra factor eks can also be expressed in terms of integration over two-dimensional

fermions as

es(h) = det(d d) =z [dq]er ( qldql+ qr dqr)

=z [dq] er qdq

where the qs are fermions in the fundamental representation of su (n ). thus with k
avors of such fermions we get the factor eks(h). an alternative way of writing (40) is

(41)

(42a)

(42b)

therefore

hoi =z [dq]d(h)e2cas(h) ef o

=z [dq]d (c) ef o
f =z d2x " 1

4g2 f a

 f a +

qi  dqi#

k

xi=1

where g2 = e4(k + 2ca)/4. in other words, the problem is equivalent to the computation
of functional averages in a two-dimensional ym theory coupled to k avors of massless

dirac fermions in the fundamental representation.

11

two-dimensional ym theory coupled to fermions in the fundamental representation

has been analyzed by a number of authors [10]. some of their results can be taken over

to the present context. for example, the presence of massless dynamical fermions leads

to screening of wilson loop operators. we may thus conclude that the average of the

wilson loop operator for the ymcs theory will not obey an area law; rather we should
have hwci = ew, with w/ac  0 as the area ac  .

the appearance of fermions in the fundamental representation in (42) makes the

screening of charges plausible from an intuitive point of view. nevertheless, (42) ultimately

provides only a mathematically useful representation; there are, of course, no fermions in

the ymcs theory we are considering. in fact, for the expectation value of wc , one can
directly do the integration using (40); the term eks leads to short range propagators for

the gauge potentials and hence to screening.

since screening eects generally require the presence of charged particles in the phys-

ical spectrum, one might ask the question of whether these can be understood in terms

of the gauge elds themselves. the inner product (26) shows that matrix elements in the

ymcs theory are obtained in terms of a hermitian wzw model of level (k + 2ca). the
correlators in this model are the analytic continuation of the correlators of the level k
su (n ) wzw-model with  = k + ca replaced by  = (k + ca). the states of nite
norm in ymcs theory can thus be constructed in terms of the integrable primary oper-

ators of the su (n )-theory and not just the currents; such primary operators other than
the identity do exist for k 6= 0 [1,2,8]. an example of such a state would be

 = u (, ~x)m (~x)
u (, ~x) = p exp(cid:20)z 
a(cid:21)

~x

(43)

 is gauge invariant under transformations which go to the identity at spatial innity.
under gauge transformations which go to a constant h 6= 1 at spatial innity,   h,
which is what is expected of a charged state.

5. comparison with previous results

as mentioned before, there have been many papers analyzing dierent aspects of the

ymcs theory. a hamiltonian analysis, which is closest in spirit to ours, is in a recent paper

by grignani et al where a gauge invariant construction of eigenstates of t is presented [5].

12

the construction of the states is as follows. dene

s(g, a, b) = s(g) +

1

 z tr[g1 gb  agg1 + agbg1 

1
2

( aa + bb)]

(44)

where g(x) is an su (n )-valued eld, s(g) is the wzw action and b is an auxiliary eld
variable. equation (44) is like a gauged wzw action with ( a, b) acting as the gauge
eld. using (2), we can check immediately that eaeks(g,a,b) = 0. the strategy used in
ref. [5] is to use this fact and dene the vacuum wavefunction for t as

0[a, b] =z [dg] eks(g,a,b)

(45)

where the group integration is done with the haar measure. the resulting 0[a, b] still
depends on the auxiliary variable b but by dening the inner product as

h1|2i =z [dadb]
volg



1(a, b)2(a, b)

(46)

one has a systematic way to compute matrix elements. (g is the space of all gauge trans-
formations which approach a constant at spatial innity.) under a gauge transformation,
m  hm , m   m h1, we have g  hg. since eb(~x) behaves as a creation operator
by virtue of (3), one can use the gauge transformation property of g and dene a gauge

invariant excited state

a[~x; a, b] = eb(~x)z [dg] gba(~x)eks(g,a,b)

(47)

higher excited states were also dened in ref. [5]; for comparison with our results, the lowest
excited state (47) is adequate to illustrate the main points. since e has the commutation
rule (3) with e and does not aect gba, it was argued in ref. [5], that a[~x; a, b] is an
eigenstate of t with eigenvalue e2k/4. it was indicated that the proper regularization of
e e in t might modify the result, although no calculations to this eect were given. in
comparing with our results in section 3 the following questions arise: how are the states

a[~x; a, b] related to our excited states created by the action of the current ja on the 0,
eq. (32)? if they are related what is the correct energy eigenvalue? these questions were

already posed in ref. [5]. in what follows we present an analysis which essentially provides

an answer to these questions and the source of the discrepancy between our results and

the ones in ref. [5].

13

we begin with the observation that 0[a, b] in (45) is proportional to our 0 in (31).
we can write b = n n 1 for some sl(n, c)-matrix n and then (44) can be written
as

s(g, a, b) = s(m gn )  s(m )  s(n ) 

equation (45) now becomes

0[a, b] = eks(m ) k

eks(n) k

4r ba baz dgeks(m gn)

where, by invariance of the haar measure, dg = d(m gn ) and hence c is independent of
a, a. 0[a, b] in (45) agrees upto a normalization constant with our 0 in (31).

consider now the excited state (47). carrying out the action of eb on s(g, a, b) we

a[~x; a, b] =

ik

4 z [dg] gba(~x)[ab  (gbg1  gg1)b](~x)eks(g,a,b)

(50)

there are singularities involved in this expression. a[~x; a, b] involves averages with the
level k su (n ) wzw model and, in particular, it involves the combination gba(~x)gg1(~x).
since gg1 is the current of the wzw model, there are singularities in the wzw cor-
relator hgg1(~y)gba(~x)i as ~y  ~x, as is evident from the standard operator product
expansions. this is also seen from the use of (48) to simplify (50). we nd

a[~x; a, b] =

where p = m gn .

(52)

we see that (47), as written, is not well dened. to avoid the singularity in the second

term of (51), we must introduce some sort of point-splitting. we can dene a proper

regularized version of (47) by

a[~x; a, b] = rcb(~x, ~y)ec(~x)z [dg]gba(~y)eks(g,a,b)|~y~x

(53a)

is the wilson line from y to x (written above for small separation). with this regularization

rcb(~x, ~y) =hea(xy) a(xy)icb

we can now evaluate a[x; a, b] to get

a[~x; a, b] =

we see that a[x; a, b] is indeed proportional to our excited state (32). however two
remarks concerning (54) are in order. first of all, regularization is important, not just for

the evaluation of t , but for dening the a itself via (47). secondly, the average of p in
(54b) is actually zero. thus the state would be zero unless this trivial (independent of
a, a) factor can be removed by some suitable procedure. it may be possible to do this
by dening renormalized gabs with factors depending on infrared and ultraviolet cutos
(similar to what is done in minimal conformal models [11]). this problem appears only in

the case of the lowest excited state a[~x; a, b].

since a[~x; a, b] is proportional to ja(~x)0 we would expect that its energy eigenvalue
at the strong coupling limit (its t eigenvalue) should be e2
4 (k + 2ca), according to our
analysis. thus regularization should indeed shift the eigenvalue from the value e2k/4

found in ref. [5]. we shall now go over the salient features of such a regularized calculation.

first of all, instead of (53b) we use the more sytematic expression

rcb(~x, ~y) =(cid:2)m 1(x, x)h(x, y)h 1(y, y)m (y, y)(cid:3)cb (~x, ~y, )

(~x, ~y, ) =

(55)

1


exp(cid:0)|~x  ~y|2/(cid:1)

as   0, (~x, ~y, )  (~x, ~y) and rcb(~x, ~y)  cb(~x, ~y) as desired. expansion of (55) for
small separations coincides with (53b). the regularized state is given by

a[~x; a, b] =zyz [dg] rcb(~x, ~y)ec(~x)gba(~y)eks(g,a,b)
the action of e on s(g, a, b) produces the following expression for (56)
a[~x; a, b] =

in evaluating the other terms we make the following observations. the commutator
of h(x, y)h 1(y, y) with e or e is of order (x  y) and it vanishes as x  y. how-
1
xy coming from the operator product expansion
ever there are singularities of the order
gbe(~y)(gg1)c(~x) in terms i and iii. as a result one might expect a nite contribution
from i and iii. there are also possible new singularities due to the coincidence limit
taken when e( ~w) and e( ~w) act on the operators at the same position, which needs more
careful treatment. with the regularized expressions for e, e from (2), (15) and (18) we
have

[ ek( ~w), h(x, y)h 1(y, y)] = 

mkl( ~w)[glm( ~w, x, y)  glm( ~w, ~y)]h(x, y)t mh 1(y, y)
(60)
where t m are the lie algebra generators in the adjoint representation. after tedious but

straightforward calculations, the commutator rw[e, [ e, hh 1]] can be shown to be

[e( ~w), [ e( ~w), h(x, y)h 1(y, y)]] =

(x  y)j(~x) + o((x  y)2)

combining this with (52) we get

similarly, we get a nonzero nite result from term iii,

iii =

4

jb0z eks(g)(gn 1)ba

(63)

the remaining terms ii and iv need careful evaluation; the calculations are once again

quite long since most of the integrals involved do not admit approximations for the

parameter-regimes of interest. eventually the terms ii and iv are seen to vanish. using

the results (58-63), we then nd

t a[~x; a, b] =

(64)

the eigenvalue of t is indeed (e2/4)(k + 2ca) in agreement with our results. thus the
analysis of ref. [5], if carried further, taking account of regularizations, will give results

identical to ours.

similar results hold for the higher excited states considered in [5]. as an example we

consider the properly regularized excited state with two e s, namely

a1a2 [~x1, ~x2; a, b] =z [dg]
2ca(cid:19)2z

(65)

this expression can be simplied by carrying out the operator product expansion as before.

in this case, we need to reduce three- and four-point functions of the type

z eks(g)gb1a1 (~y1)gb2a2 (~y2)(gg1)c1(~x1)
z eks(g)gb1a1 (~y1)gb2a2 (~y2)(gg1)c1(~x1)(gg1)c2 (~x2)

(66a)

(66b)

into two-point functions of two gs. after taking singularities from operator product ex-

pansions into account, we nd

a1a2 [~x1, ~x2; a, b] =((cid:18)1 +

k

2ca(cid:19)2

jb1 (~x1)jb2 (~x2) +(cid:18)1 +

[ g(~x1, ~x2)]2b1b2(cid:27)z eks(g)(gn 1)b1a1 (~y1)(gn 1)b2a2 (~y2)0

(67)

17

where the factor 1 in the rst two terms has come from regulators as in the lowest excited

j state. using the expression (38) of t in terms of j, t on a1a2 [~x1, ~x2; a, b] becomes

t a1a2 = 2 ma1a2 + 2 mca[g(~x1, ~x2)]2b1b2z eks(g)(gn 1)b1a1 (~x1)(gn 1)b2a2 (~x2)0

(68)

therefore the state a1a2 is essentially an eigenstate of t (by redening the constant part
in a1a2 to absorb the last term in (68)). the corresponding eigenvalue is 2 e2
4 (k +2ca). in
obtaining this result, it is crucial that the ratio of the coecients of the two-j and one-j

terms in a1a2 is as in (67); otherwise one does not get an eigenstate of t of the form
(38). although we did not explicitly calculate eigenvalues of t for even higher excited
states, we expect the eigenvalue of the state involving n es or n js to be n e2
4 (k + 2ca).
thus we see that the contribution of the regulator used in dening states is important.

an interesting point of the above calculation is that the eigenvalues add up without any

correction, irrespective of the positions ~x1 and ~x2. therefore, in the strong coupling limit
where the potential term is neglected, there is no interaction between js which modies

the eigenvalue.

in other words, the js can be far separated from each other. this is

consistent with the fact that there is no connement in ymcs theory. one might ask the

question of whether such states can also occur in pure ym theory. we expect these states

to be nonnormalizable in this case, in agreement with the expected connement in the

pure yang-mills case.

our calculation which gives the shift 2ca  k + 2ca takes account of the nonpertur-
bative corrections to the mass. this is dierent from the shift k  k + ca expected from
perturbative calculations [12]. such perturbative corrections to our calculation may also

exist; they can in principle be calculated using perturbation theory in the hamiltonian
formalism. the explicitly self-adjoint expression (28) for t is most suited for this analysis;
the mixing of parity-violating and conserving terms, as in the calculation of pisarski and

rao, should produce the perturbative corrections. cornwall has recently pointed out that

the inclusion of both perturbative and nonperturbative eects for the mass can perhaps

lead to some sort of critical behaviour at a certain value of k [13]. our calculations do not

go far enough to make more precise statements regarding this question.

6. conclusion

we have performed a hamiltonian analysis of yang-mills theory with a level k chern-

simons term in terms of gauge invariant variables. the low lying spectrum of this theory

18

at the strong coupling limit has been obtained. the gauge invariant version of the massive
gauge boson states is given in terms of the current j a. the mass of the gauge boson
is e2
4 (k + 2ca). long distance properties of vacuum expectation values are related to
a euclidean two-dimensional ym theory coupled to k avors of dirac fermions in the

fundamental representation. the expectation value of the wilson loop operator should

exhibit screening rather than an area law. related comments and comparison with previous

results are also given.
