we show that, in the framework of covariant hamiltonian eld theory, a degenerate almost
regular quadratic lagrangian l admits a complete set of non-degenerate hamiltonian forms such
that solutions of the corresponding hamilton equations, which live in the lagrangian constraint
space, exhaust solutions of the eulerlagrange equations for l. we obtain the characteristic
splittings of the conguration and momentum phase bundles. due to the corresponding projec-
tion operators, the koszultate resolution of the lagrangian constraints for a generic almost
regular quadratic lagrangian is constructed in an explicit form.

introduction

the covariant hamiltonian approach to eld theory has been vigorously developed from
the seventies (see [1-3] for a survey). this is the hamiltonian counterpart of lagran-
gian eld theory on bre bundles y  x, which looks promising for quantization [4].
if dimx = 1, covariant hamiltonian formalism provides the adequate description of ha-
miltonian time-dependent mechanics [5,6]. here, we aim to apply some elements of the
classical brst technique for hamiltonian systems to covariant hamiltonian theory.

let us recall that, given a bre bundle y  x coordinated by (x, yi), a rst order

lagrangian l of elds is dened as a horizontal density

l = l(x, yi, yi

),  = dx1     dxn, n = dim x,

on the jet bundle j 1y  x seen as a nite-dimensional conguration space of elds
and coordinated by (x, yi, yi
). the corresponding eulerlagrange equations take the
coordinate form

(i  d

i )l = 0,

d =  + yi

every lagrangian l (1) yields the legendre map

and the corresponding covariant hamilton equations

(3)

in the case of hyperregular lagrangians, lagrangian formalism and covariant hamilto-
nian formalism are equivalent. for any hyperregular lagrangian l, there exists a unique
hamiltonian form h such that the eulerlagrange equations (2) for l are equivalent to
the hamilton equations (3) for h. the case of degenerate lagrangians is more intricate.
let us restrict our consideration to almost regular lagrangians l, i.e., (i) the lagrangian

constraint space nl = bl(j 1y ) is a closed imbedded subbundle of the legendre bundle
  y , (ii) the legendre map bl : j 1y  nl is a bred manifold, and (iii) the inverse
image bl1(q) of any point q  nl is a connected submanifold of j 1y . at least locally,

one can assign to l a complete set of hamiltonian forms h such that there is one-to-one
correspondence between solutions of the hamilton equations for h from this set, which
live in the lagrangian constraint space nl, and solutions of the eulerlagrange equations
for l (see [2, 3, 9] for a detailed exposition). it is important that these hamiltonian forms
h are not necessarily degenerate.

in the present work, the case of almost regular quadratic lagrangians, appropriate for
application to many physical models, is studied in detail. we obtain a complete set of non-
degenerate hamiltonian forms with the above mentioned properties for a generic almost

2

regular quadratic lagrangian. we show that, in this case, the legendre bundle  admits
the characteristic splitting  = ker   nl (12a). using the corresponding projection
operators, we construct the koszultate resolution for the lagrangian constraints nl of
a generic almost regular quadratic lagrangian l in an explicit form.

2 quadratic degenerate systems

given a bre bundle y  x, let us consider a quadratic lagrangian l which has the
coordinate expression

l =

1
2

a
ij yi

yj

 + b

i yi

 + c,

(4)

where a, b and c are local functions on y . this property is coordinate-independent due
to the ane transformation law of coordinates yi

. the associated legendre map

ij yj

 + b

i

p

i  bl = a

is an ane morphism over y . it denes the corresponding linear morphism

l : t x 
y

v y 
y

,

i  l = a
p

ij yj
,

(5)

(6)

where t x y v y is the underlying vector bundle of the ane jet bundle j 1y  y and
yj
 are bundle coordinates on it.

let the lagrangian l (4) be almost regular, i.e., the matrix function a
ij

is of constant
rank. then the lagrangian constraint space nl (5) is an ane subbundle of the legendre
bundle   y , modelled over the vector subbundle n l (6) of   y . hence, nl  y
has a global section. for the sake of simplicity, let us assume that it is the canonical zero

section b0(y ) of   y . then n l = nl. accordingly, the kernel of the legendre map

(5) is an ane subbundle of the ane jet bundle j 1y  y , modelled over the kernel of
the linear morphism l (6). then there exists a connection

 : y  kerbl  j 1y,

a
ij j

 + b

i = 0,

(7)

on y  x. connections (7) constitute an ane space modelled over the linear space of
soldering forms  on y  x satisfying the conditions

a
ij j

 = 0,

i
b

i = 0.

(8)

the key point of our consideration is a linear bundle map

 :

   = ij

(9)

such that l  |nl = id nl. it is a solution of the algebraic equations

a
ij jk

a

kb = a
ib .

the matrix a in the lagrangian l (4) can be seen as a global section of constant rank of
the tensor bundle

n
 t x 
(t x 
[

v y )]  y.

by virtue of the well-known theorem on the splitting of an exact sequence of vector
bundles, there exists the bundle splitting

t x 
y

v y = ker a 
y

e,

(10)

together with a (non-holonomic) atlas of this bundle such that transition functions of ker a
2
and e are independent. since a is a non-degenerate section of
 e)  y , there
exists an atlas of e such that a is brought into a diagonal matrix with non-vanishing
components aaa. due to the splitting (10), we have the corresponding bundle splitting

n
 t x 
y

(

t x 
y

v y = (ker a) 
y

e.

then the desired map  is represented by a direct sum 1  0 of an arbitrary section 1
of the bre bundle

n

and the section 0 of the bre bundle

n

(

which has non-vanishing components aa = (aaa)1 with respect to the above mentioned
atlas of e. moreover,  satises the additional relations

0 = 0  l  0,

a  1 = 0,

1  a = 0.

with the map (9), we have the splittings

j 1y = s(j 1y )

it is readily observed that, with respect to the coordinates s i
the lagrangian (4) reads

l =

k = 0.

(13)

(14)

note that, in gauge theory on principal bundles, we have the canonical splitting (11a)
where 2f is the strength tensor [3, 8]. the yangmills lagrangian of this gauge theory is
exactly of the form (13) where c = 0. the lagrangian of proca elds is also of the form
(13) where c is the mass term. this is an example of a degenerate lagrangian system
without gauge symmetries.

given the linear map  (9) and a connection  (7), let us consider the hamiltonian

form

h = p

one can show that the hamiltonian forms (15) parametrised by connections  (7) con-
stitute a complete set for the lagrangian (4) [3].
it is readily observed that, if 1 is
non-degenerate, so are the hamiltonian forms (15). thus, for dierent 1, we have dif-
ferent complete sets of hamiltonian forms (15). hamiltonian forms h (15) of such a
complete set dier from each other in the term i
i , where  are the soldering forms (8).
it follows from the splitting (12a) that this term vanishes on the lagrangian constraint
space.

3 geometry of antighosts

we aim to obtain the koszultate resolution for the constraints (14). since these con-
straints are reducible, we need an innite number of antighost elds in general [10, 11]
(we follow the terminology of [11]). they are graded by the antighost number r and
the grassmann parity r mod2. therefore, we should generalize the notion of a graded
manifold [12] to commutative graded algebras generated both by odd and even elements.
let e = e0  e1  z be the whitney sum of vector bundles e0  z and e1  z
over a manifold z. one can think of e as being a bundle of vector superspaces with a
typical bre v = v0  v1 where transition functions of e0 and e1 are independent. let
us consider the exterior bundle

e =

(

mk=0

k

z

e),

which is the tensor bundle e modulo elements

e0e

0  e

0e0,

e1e

1 + e

1e1,

e0e1  e1e0

e0, e

0  e
0z,

e1, e

1  e
1z,

z  z.

0(z)  e

global sections of e constitute a commutative graded algebra a(z) modelled on the
1 (z) of global sections of e. this is the product of
locally free c (z)-module e
the commutative algebra a0(z) of global sections of the symmetric bundle e
0  z and
the graded algebra a1(z) of global sections of the exterior bundle e
1  z. the pair
(z, a1(z)) is a graded manifold [12]. for the sake of brevity, we agree to call (z, a(z))
a graded manifold, though its generating set contain an even subset a0. accordingly,
elements of a(z) are called graded functions. let us introduce the dierential calculus in
these functions.

we start from the a(z)-module dera(z) of graded derivations of a(z). recall that by
a graded derivation of the commutative graded algebra a(z) is meant an endomorphism
of a(z) such that

u(f f ) = u(f )f  + (1)[u][f ]f u(f )

(16)

for the homogeneous elements u  dera(z) and f, f   a(z). we use the notation [.] for
the grassmann parity.

we aim to show that graded derivations (16) are represented by sections of a vector
bundle. let {ca} be the holonomic bases for e  z with respect to some bundle atlas

6

(za, vi) of e  z with transition functions {a
read

b }, i.e., ca = a

b (z)cb. then graded functions

f = xk=0

1
k!

fa1...ak ca1    cak,

(17)

where fa1ak are local functions on z, and we omit the symbol of an exterior product of
elements c. the coordinate transformation law of graded functions (17) is obvious. due
to the canonical splitting v e = e  e, the vertical tangent bundle v e  e can be
provided with the bre bases {a} dual of {ca}. these are bre bases for pr2v e = e.
then any derivation u of a(u) on a trivialization domain u of e reads

u = uaa + uaa,

where ua, ua are local graded functions and u acts on f  a(u) by the rule

u(fa1ak ca1    cak ) = uaa(fa1ak)ca1    cak + uafa...ba(ca    cb).

this rule implies the corresponding coordinate transformation law

ua = ua,

ua = a

j uj + uaa(a

j )cj

(18)

(19)

of derivations (18). let us consider the vector bundle ve  z which is locally isomorphic
to the vector bundle

ve |u  e 
z

(pr2v e 
z

t z) |u ,

and has the transition functions

i1...ik = 1a1

of the bundle coordinates (za
b1...bk), k = 0, . . .. these transition functions fulll
the cocycle relations.
it is readily observed that, for any trivialization domain u, the
a-module dera(u) with the transition functions (19) is isomorphic to the a-module of
local sections of ve |u  u. one can show that, if u   u are open sets, there is the
restriction morphism dera(u)  dera(u). it follows that, restricted to an open subset
u, every derivation u of a(z) coincides with some local section uu of ve |u  u, whose
collection {uu , u  z} denes uniquely a global section of ve  z, called a graded
vector eld on z.

7

the e-dual v 

e of ve is a vector bundle over z whose sections constitute the a(z)-
module of exterior graded 1-forms  = adza + adca. then the morphism  : u  a(z)
can be seen as the interior product

u = uaa + (1)[a]uaa.

(20)

graded k-forms  are dened as sections of the graded exterior bundle k

zv 

e such that

   = (1)||||+[][]  ,

where |.| is the form degree. the interior product (20) is extended to higher graded forms
by the rule

u(  ) = (u)   + (1)||+[][u]  (u).

the graded exterior dierential d of graded functions is introduced by the condition
udf = u(f ) for an arbitrary graded vector eld u, and is extended uniquely to higher
graded forms by the rules

d(  ) = (d)   + (1)||  (d),

d  d = 0.

4 the koszultate resolution

let us turn to the splitting (12a) and introduce the projection operators

i = a
p k

ij 0

jk
,

such that

rk

i = (k

i 

  a

ij 0

jk
)

p k

k = 0,

k = r

(21)

to construct the vector bundle e of antighosts, let us consider the vertical tangent
bundle vy  of   y . let us chose the bundle e as the whitney sum of the bundles
e0  e1 over  which are the innite whitney sum over  of the copies of vy . we have

e = vy  


vy  


   .

this bundle is provided with the holonomic coordinates (t, yi, p
i , p(2l+1)
(t, yi, p

) are coordinates on e0, while (t, yi, p

the same linear coordinate transformation law as the coordinates p

graded vector elds and graded forms are introduced on  as sections of the vector bundles

the c ()-module a() of graded functions is graded by the antighost number as

(23)

the nilpotency property    = 0 of this dierential is the corollary of the relations (21).
it is readily observed that the complex (22) with respect to the dierential (23) has

the homology groups

hk>1 = 0,

h0 = c (v q)/inl = c (nl),

where inl is an ideal of smooth functions on  which vanishes on the lagrangian con-
straint space hl. thus, this is a desired koszultate resolution of the constraints (14)
dened by the lagrangian (4).

note that, in dierent particular cases of the degenerate quadratic lagrangian (4),
the complex (22) may have a subcomplex, which is also the koszultate resolution. for
instance, if the bre metric a in v q  q is diagonal with respect to a holonomic atlas
of v q, the constraints (14) are irreducible and the complex (22) contains a subcomplex
which consists only of the antighosts c(1)
