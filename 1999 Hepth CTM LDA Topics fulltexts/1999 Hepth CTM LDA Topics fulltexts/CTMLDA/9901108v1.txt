abstract

we consider the dynamics of a relativistic dirac particle constrained to move
in the interior of a twisted tube by conning boundary conditions, in the
approximation that the curvature of the tube is small and slowly varying. in
contrast with the nonrelativistic theory, which predicts that a particles spin
does not change as the particle propagates along the tube, we nd that the
angular momentum eigenstates of a relativistic spin- 1
2 particle may behave
nontrivially. for example, a particle with its angular momentum initially
polarized in the direction of propagation may acquire a nonzero component
of angular momentum in the opposite direction on turning through 2 radians.
also, the usual nonrelativistic eective potential acquires an additional factor
in the relativistic theory.

i. introduction

twisted tubes, in which particles are conned by an external potential, have proven to be
excellent settings for the study of quantum mechanics in curved geometries. they have been
studied extensively in the context of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, with particular fo-
cus on the case of small and slowly varying curvature [1]. one important example is the
limit of a very narrow tube, where the conning potential constrains a particle to move on
a curve, just as a physical bead might be attached to a wire. subsequent authors have con-
sidered the natural extension to a particle conned to a small neighborhood of an arbitrary
riemannian manifold embedded in a higher-dimensional euclidean space and have applied
their formalism to the energy spectra of molecules [2]. for a recent survey of the dynamics
of a particle in various conning potentials in a loosely interpreted tube see ref. [3]. how-
ever, analysis has been largely limited to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, in which spin
does not aect the dynamics; the relativistic theory has been thoroughly investigated only
for connement and quantization schemes other than the conning potential approach [4].
here we present for the rst time a treatment of a relativistic dirac particle in the conning
potential approach using conning boundary conditions.

the phenomena associated with the propagation of a relativistic fermion within a tube
contrast with the simpler and well-known case of light propagating in an optical ber,
studied in the mid-1980s by chiao and wu [5]. they assumed the ber to have constant
circular cross-section and small and smoothly varying curvature.
in this approximation,
they argued that the two states of circular polarization (helicity 1) propagate along the
ber without mixing with one another and accumulate opposite berry phases proportional
to the integral of the torsion along the ber. it is instructive to re-examine their argument
that the helicity eigenstates do not mix [5]. first they use the adiabatic theorem to argue
that modes with dierent transverse waveforms do not mix as they propagate through a
smooth ber. the lowest energy level is doubly degenerate, with total angular momentum
component along the axis of the ber ~j  t = 1. the longitudinal mode, ~j  t = 0, is
excluded by gauge invariance. following chiao and wu we refer to these modes somewhat
loosely as photon states of helicity 1. in the limit of a thin ber, the only surviving terms
in the hamiltonian aecting helicity are of the form ~  ~s, where the vector curvature, ~,
is a vector in the direction of the principal normal to the ber and of length , 1/ is the
instantaneous radius of curvature of the ber, and ~s is the photons spin. since ~  ~s is a
vector operator, the wigner-eckart theorem allows a change in helicity only by h = 1.
h = 2 is forbidden, so the helicity states propagate without mixing, even though they
are degenerate  a consequence of gauge invariance.
the point of departure for our paper is the observation that chiao and wus argument
does not apply to a dirac fermion, which has doubly degenerate modes with helicity ~j  t =
(n + 1
2). once again we refer to these modes somewhat loosely as fermion states of helicity
2). in particular, the ground state modes have n = 0, so ~j  t =  1
(n + 1
2. the wigner-
eckart theorem does not forbid transitions between these states because the eigenvalues of
~j  t dier by 1. we cannot exclude the possibility that the degenerate angular momentum
states will mix as they propagate on the basis of symmetry. therefore the dirac equation
demands more careful analysis.

as in ref. [1], we consider a particle conned to the interior of a tube with circular cross-
section. we work in the rest frame of the tube. the tube may be constructed by transporting
a circular disc such that the center of the disc traces a smooth curve ~x(s) and the tangent to
the curve is normal to the disc for all values of the arc-length parameter s. the region swept
out by the disc is the tube. we model the potential that connes the particle to the tube by
means of a boundary condition. the boundary condition must guarantee that the normal
component of the probability current ~j = ~ vanishes on the surface of the tube. in the
nonrelativistic problem one can simply impose dirichlet boundary conditions. however, in
the dirac theory, the requirement that all components of the wavefunction vanish on the
boundary is too stringent, for then in general the dirac wavefunction will vanish everywhere.
a less severe condition that will still conne probability is

 i~  n = 

(1)

where n is the unit normal (in the outward sense) to the boundary of the tube [7]. that
eq. (1) guarantees probability connement follows from the commutation relations for the
-matrices and the antihermiticity of ~. eq. (1) reduces to the usual dirichlet boundary
condition on the large components of the dirac spinor in the nonrelativistic limit.

it is a general feature of the dirac equation that spin and orbital angular momentum

dirac particles in twisted tubes

3

are not separately conserved. it is not surprising, therefore, that the boundary condition,
eq. (1) does not commute with the spin operator. the result is the nontrivial transport
of angular momentum states that we will calculate. we could have chosen other boundary
conditions, for example the chiral generalization of eq. (1),

 i~  n = ei5

(2)

parameterized by the chiral angle , with a slightly dierent phenomenology. we will explore
some of the alternatives in the nal section of this paper.

in section ii we establish coordinates in the interior of the tube that will be convenient
for our purposes. section iii is a construction of the dynamical equations of our system in
the parallel transport frame. we write the dynamical equations as those for propagation in
a straight tube with an interaction. in section iv we calculate the necessary basis states
for a dirac particle in a straight tube. in section v we specialize to the approximation that
the curvature is small and slowly varying. this approximation appears to capture most of
the interesting physics. we then expand the hamiltonian to lowest nontrivial order in small
parameters. using the resulting hamiltonian, we compute in section vi the relevant dynam-
ical equations. section vii contains our conclusions and also briey discusses possibilities
for boundary conditions other than eq. (1).

ii. elementary formalism

we construct a coordinate system for the tube described in section i by erecting a right-
handed orthonormal frame at each point on the curve. we parameterize the curve as ~x(s)
where s is the arc-length parameter. since the tangent to the curve is always normal to the
cross-sectional disc that sweeps out the tube, a natural choice of frame is {e1, e2, e3} where
e1 and e2 are orthogonal unit vectors in the plane of the disc and e3 is the unit tangent to
the disc in the direction of increasing s. for clarity we adopt a summation convention where
greek indices, , , etc., are summed over 1, 2, and 3, whereas latin indices, i, j, etc., are
summed only over the transverse directions 1 and 2. to completely dene the frame, we
must specify the s-dependence of e1 and e2. we require that the frame rotates smoothly as
the disc sweeps out the tube. that is,

de
ds

= ~  e

(3)

where ~(s) is a smoothly varying instantaneous angular velocity associated with the ro-
tation of the frame.

since the curve uniquely determines e3(s), it determines ~(s) up to the addition of a
constant multiple of e3(s), corresponding to an additional rotation of the transverse axes
about the tangent. for simplicity, we adopt the parallel transport frame, in which ~ has
no component along the tangent. there is a simple visual model of the parallel transport
frame. imagine a rigid wire with a disc attached to it by a frictionless sleeve that keeps the
disc normal to the sleeve. without friction all the torques act in the plane of the disc so
the angular momentum about the tangent direction is conserved. if the disc has no angular
velocity about e3 initially, it will not develop any. in this case, vectors drawn on the disc

dirac particles in twisted tubes

are said to execute parallel transport along the wire. a simple calculation shows that the
instantaneous angular velocity of this frame is

~ = e3 

de3

.

(4)

a new coordinate system for points inside the tube may now be specied in terms of the
parallel transport frame by

~x(s, 1, 2) = ~x(s) + 1e1 + 2e2 .

in this coordinate system, the spatial metric tensor is diagonal

where the vector curvature ~ of x(s) is dened as

~

comparison with the denition of ~ shows

~ = e3  ~ or
2 = 1

and 1 = 2 .

the diagonal metric tensor yields a simple gradient operator:

the volume element for integration in these coordinates is qdet gjkdsd2 = (1  ~ ~)dsd2.
since the tube intersects itself if ~  ~ equals one, we require that r < 1 where r is the
radius of the disc.
an important subtlety is that while the choice of the parallel transport frame is always
valid locally, it is not always possible to adopt it globally. in particular, if the curve is closed,
parallel transport of the frame through one circuit of the curve need not return the frame
to its original orientation. this geometric feature manifests itself in classical physics as the
well-known hannays angle [8,1]. for the purposes of this paper, we assume that our tube
continues indenitely without intersecting itself.

iii. dirac equation in the parallel transport frame

in free space, with units such that h = c = 1, the hamiltonian in the dirac equation

h = e is

h = (i~  ~ + m + v ) .

we dene  and  as usual by i = 0i and  = 0; in the chiral basis that we employ,

the factor of  in the integration measure complicates calculations and questions of her-
miticity. therefore we dene new wavefunctions  by

(14)

which have the normalization r dsd2  = 1. the original dirac equation can be re-
cast in terms of a hamiltonian operator h, dened by h =

(15)

this hamiltonian is dicult to calculate with because the matrices ~e are s-dependent.
that is, the momentum operators are expressed with respect to the rotating coordinate
frame while the spin operators are expressed with respect to some xed rectilinear frame.
to remedy this problem, we change the spin basis. we dene a unitary transformation 
by

(s)~  e(s)(s) = 

(16)

for all s. here we have made the s dependence of the unit vectors e explicit.

dierentiating the above condition with respect to s and using eq. (3) for de/ds, we

to take advantage of this transformation, we once again dene new wavefunctions,

(17)

(19)

and a new dirac hamiltonian, h,

h =  h .

(20)

the form of eq. (18) indicates that the transformation (s) just represents a change of spin
basis to the spinors representing spin up and down in the e3(s) direction. although this
transformation replaces the -matrices as intended, it generates a gauge term in h,

simplifying 3 ~ ~ yields i~~. thus, this gauge term cancels the second term in eq. (15)

the transformations we have performed reduce our problem to the study of this perturbed
dirac hamiltonian in a right circular cylinder, (1)2 + (2)2  r2,  < s <, with respect
to a xed rectilinear frame. the price of this simplication is the variety of curvature
dependent terms in eq. (22).

iv. decomposition into transverse eigenstates

we look for eigenstates of the hamiltonian in eq. (22) of the form

(s, ~) = x{}

c{}(s){}(~)

where the {{}} are eigenstates of the transverse hamiltonian,

h = ij 

j + m

satisfying the boundary condition

i~  r = |r=r .

(23)

(24)

(25)

here we have introduced plane polar coordinates, r = |~| and  = tan1 2/1. the labels
{} denote the quantum numbers necessary to specify the eigenstates of h completely.
h is just the free dirac hamiltonian in one lower dimension. s3 and l3, the tangen-
tial components of the spin and orbital angular momentum respectively, do not separately
commute with h but j3 = l3 + s3 does. j3 also commutes with the operator ~  r in the
boundary condition. in addition, the operator 0s3 commutes with h, j3, and ~  r. we
dene the transverse energy as the eigenvalue  of h. an eigenstate of h with eigen-
value  may thus be chosen to be an eigenstate of the helicity operator j3 with eigenvalue 
( = n  1/2 for some integer n) and of the operator 0s3 with eigenvalue  ( =  1
2). for
simplicity, we use the notation {, } when specifying these quantum numbers.

h has the usual dirac charge conjugation symmetry, so each eigenstate with eigenvalue
+|| is paired with another with eigenvalue ||. since 3 anticommutes with h and 0s3
and commutes with j3 and ~  r, 3, = ,. the transformation that sends j3 to j3
commutes with h and ~  r and anticommutes with 0s3. thus, the states with + have
the same eigenvalue  as states with . for each value of  and , there are towers of
radial excitations, one for positive  and one for negative , obtained by adding more nodes
to the radial wavefunction. a summary of the eigenstates of h for small  and  is given
in fig. 1.

with these general considerations in mind, we construct the explicit representation of

the wavefunction , for positive :

, and q satises the following equation obtained from the boundary condition:

the normalization n is xed up to a phase by the condition

jn(qr) =  1jn1(qr) .

z d2 = 1 .

(27)

(28)

the unusual form of the spinors in the nonrelativistic limit is due to our choice of the
chiral representation of the dirac matrices (5 = diag(1,1, 1, 1)). transforming the
eigenstates to the dirac basis (0 = diag(1, 1,1,1)), we nd that only one of the two

dirac particles in twisted tubes

8

upper components and one of the two lower components of each wavefunction are nonzero.
in the nonrelativistic limit, for the states with positive , the lower components in the dirac
basis tend to zero. these are eigenstates of s3 and l3, in agreement with the fact that
0s3 is just s3 on the upper components in the dirac basis. we use the chiral basis because
the wavefunctions can be expressed more compactly away from the nonrelativistic limit and
because computation of matrix elements is simpler.

for a straight tube, the energy eigenstates with helicity  and longitudinal momentum

k are obtained from the ansatz, eq. (23):

(s, ~) = exp iks(cid:16),(~) +

2 + k2 + ||

,(~)(cid:17) .

(29)

in a twisting tube, the energy eigenstates could be superpositions of several {,} with
nontrivial {c,(s)} determined by eq. (22).
in later sections, we will study the propagation and mixing of the ground states of
the transverse hamiltonian, i.e., those with the smallest possible value (0) for ||. for
concreteness, we present the explicit form of the wavefunctions for this fourfold degenerate
set of states:

(32)

in the nonrelativistic limit (m  q), eq. (31) reduces to j0(qr) = 0, a familiar result, and
in the ultrarelativistic limit (m  0) it becomes j0(qr) = j1(qr).

v. adiabatic condition

in addition to assuming that the vector curvature, ~, is a smooth function of s, we
assume that it is nonzero only in a nite region. thus the tube consists of two innitely
long straight regions joined by a curved region of nite length. our goal is to propagate the

dirac particles in twisted tubes

9

unperturbed solutions to the dirac equation, labelled by their longitudinal momentum, k,
and their transverse quantum numbers, {, }, through the region of nonzero curvature.
we expect both scattering states (k real) and bound states (k imaginary). by the transverse
quantum numbers of a tube eigenstate, we mean the quantum numbers associated with the
rst term of its representation in the form given by eq. (29).

we restrict our analysis to the case of adiabatic propagation in a mildly curved tube

that dominates the work in this eld. this amounts to the conditions

|r|  1

s

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

r2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(33)

in this approximation to the nonrelativistic problem, states with dierent transverse wave-
forms do not mix [9]. because of the analogy between time development with a slowly
varying v (t) and s-development with a slowly varying curvature, this is known as the adi-
abatic approximation. the generalization of the adiabatic approximation to the dirac case
is that only states with the same values of || can mix when propagating in a smooth enough
tube. for example, the four states with || = 1
2 given explicitly in eq. (30) can mix adiabat-
ically. since this subspace includes states of dierent ~j  e3, interesting angular momentum
transport is still possible in the adiabatic limit.
for simplicity, we consider the case of small longitudinal momentum. we assume that
the square of the longitudinal momentum of a state under consideration is much smaller
than the dierence between the square of its transverse energy and that of other states with
diering transverse energy. for a particular state with a set of transverse quantum numbers
 , this amounts to the condition

|kr|  d

(34)

where d = minq|(qr)2  (qr)2| and  runs over all sets of transverse quantum numbers
such that q

6= q.

for a physical tube, these conditions are easily satised. for a xed mass m and a
given curve with smoothly varying vector curvature ~(s) which is nonvanishing only in a
nite region, we can always choose a nonzero r small enough to satisfy each of the above
conditions. there are, however, some subtleties associated with this condition. for a xed
tube radius r, making m arbitrarily large makes d arbitrarily small for most . the
additional degeneracies that develop as mr   originate in the decoupling of spin and
orbital angular momentum. thus, pairs of states with l3 = 1 and s3 =  1
2 , which are
split by relativistic eects, become degenerate as mr   as shown in fig. (2). the cases
, } are an exception. these states, which have l3 = 0 and s3 =  1
 = { 1
are degenerate for all mr, and no new degeneracies arise as mr  . again, see fig. (2).
of course, this is not problematic because we know exactly how spin and orbital angular
momentum eigenstates behave in the nonrelativistic limit: the dirac problem reduces to the
scalar problem solved, for example, in ref. [1], accompanied by a dynamically trivial spin
label.

importance of terms in the hamiltonian, we introduce scaled coordinates uj  j/r and
multiply the dirac equation by r to obtain h  = e where h  = rh and e = re are
the scaled hamiltonian and energy respectively. from eq. (22), we obtain

(37)

having systematically expanded the hamiltonian to second order in small quantities, we
may now return to unscaled coordinates. the adiabatic condition implies that the eective
potential mixes two transverse eigenstates  and  to second order in  only if || = ||,
or equivalently if q = q. thus, to second order in , the mixing amplitudes outside of the
four dimensional subspaces of xed q are negligible.

as is often the case with the dirac equation, it is easier to work with the square of
the dirac operator instead of the rst order form. since the curvature vanishes for s 
s0 for some s0, the solution (s, ~) is given by the straight cylinder problem for s < s0.
this determines both (s0, ~) and d(s, ~)/ds|s=s0. to solve the dirac equation to the
desired order, we project the equation onto the four-dimensional subspace containing (s0, ~)
to obtain four coupled rst order equations. equivalently, any solution of the projected

dirac particles in twisted tubes

11

equation must also satisfy the projection of the equation h 2 = e2 to second order in .
the initial conditions on  and d/ds at s = s0 determine a unique solution of the second
order equation, which must also be the unique solution of the rst order equation. from
now on, we study the second order equation, eq. (37). we complete the square and divide
by r2, to obtain

(38)

notice that the terms of order 3/r2, can be neglected in the adiabatic approximation. h 2
is simpler to study than h because it only mixes states with the same . thus the mixing
problem has been reduced from a 4  4 to a 2  2 problem. for simplicity, we refer to the
two dimensional space of states (with ~j  t = ) that can mix under h 2 as the adiabatic
subspace. [this simplication is analogous to the foldy-wouthuysen transformation that
eliminates the lower components of the dirac spinor in the nonrelativistic limit.] this
remarkably simple result is interpreted in the following section.

vi. propagating modes and spin evolution

2

this hamiltonian (squared) of eq. (37) appears to be the same one that one would obtain
in a nonrelativistic theory. the curvature induced potential, 2/4, is well known. the
~  ~, looks like it undoes the rotation, (s), that put us into the moving
gauge term,  i
frame. if it did, a stationary experimenter outside the tube would observe a spin vector that
always points in the same direction as the particle propagates in s. however, this description
of propagation by this hamiltonian must not be correct: because ~  ~ fails to commute
with the boundary condition eq. (1), it cannot in general be diagonalized with respect to
the transverse basis states identied in section iv.

to obtain the correct physical description, we must remember that h 2 is to be projected
onto the adiabatic subspace containing two states of opposite helicity ( =  1
2 ). the
externally prescribed vector curvature, ~, explicitly breaks rotation invariance and allows
states of dierent helicity to mix. however, the symmetry violating terms in h 2 are at most
vector operators (note (~  ~)2 = 2), and by the wigner-eckart theorem can only induce
transitions between states with helicity diering by unity. thus mixing of dierent helicity
states can only occur if || = 1
2, helicity, and in fact all
transverse quantum numbers, are conserved. this is exactly analogous to the propagation
of photons discussed by chiao and wu [5].

2 . for all the states with || > 1

states with || = 1

2 mix as they propagate. the crucial feature that distinguishes the
relativistic and nonrelativistic situations is that the states with  =  1
2 are not eigenstates
of 3. instead they are eigenstates of j3 and 0s3. since the ground states do not acquire
any additional degeneracies in the nonrelativistic limit, we can apply our formalism to them
in this limit. the ground states become l3 = 0 and s3 =  1
2 states. the gauge term in
eq. (38) exactly undoes the rotation (s) and leads to trivial spin transport along the tube.
however, in the relativistic case, the matrix elements of ~ between states with  =  1
2
are reduced by a depolarizing factor which reects the mixing of spin and orbital angular
momentum.

where the sign  is the product of the signs of the transverse quantum numbers and is the
same for the 4 basis states in each adiabatic subspace. an important caveat is that this
formula fails to hold in the nonrelativistic limit for the lower choice of sign. the states with
 = 1
2 both reduce to l = 1 and have the same transverse energy
in the nonrelativistic limit; the additional degeneracies signal that these subspaces do not
evolve adiabatically. however, as remarked earlier, we know that in this limit d = 1 and
a straightforward calculation extending to a 16-dimensional subspace of states veries this
fact.

the factor (1  i2) in eq. (40) shows the parallel between the matrix elements of
~  ~ in the {j} basis and its matrix in the basis of eigenstates of 3. the constant
of proportionality, d, measures the rate at which the spin vector rotates in the parallel
transport frame as the wave propagates. in the nonrelativistic limit,    so d  1,
and the spin completely decouples from the evolution of the tube. if d were zero for some
choice of parameters, the spin would remain xed in the parallel transport frame as for the
photon. in the ultrarelativistic limit,  = 1 and qr  1.434, the lowest root of the equation
j0(qr) = j1(qr). substitution gives d  0.767, so that even in the extreme relativistic
limit helicity is not conserved.

j=1 cj(s)j(~), the 4  4 matrix equation for the four component vector

of the j3 =  1
s3 = 1/2 states, the matrices tj rotate the j3 = 1/2 states into j3 = 1/2 states.
eq. (43) is our fundamental result. relativistic eects appear in two places. first, as
pointed out earlier, the rotation back to the laboratory xed frame is only complete in
the nonrelativistic limit, when d = 1. as q increases relative to m, d decreases. the
ideal case of d = 0, in which the helicity is conserved, is not reached even in the extreme
relativistic limit. the following section discusses opportunities presented by other choices
of boundary conditions. second, the depolarizing factor appears in the eective scalar
potential, 2d2/4. if we apply the obvious unitary transformation cd(s) = 
d(s)c(s)
(see eq. (18) ), where

this equation can be solved numerically for a given tube, with the usual phenomenology of
bound and scattering states.

vii. discussion

it is helpful to interpret our results rst in the nonrelativistic limit. we expect to nd no
coupling to the spin because the nonrelativistic boundary conditions do not involve spin at
all and the exact hamiltonian commutes with ~s. it is reassuring to see that our formalism
in the nonrelativistic limit, d  1, so that in the parallel transport
recovers this result:
frame, the spin appears to rotate with angular frequency ~, where the minus sign indicates
that the sense of the rotation is opposite that of the coordinate frame. in other words, the
spin vector maintains its orientation in the three-dimensional euclidean space in which the
tube is embedded (which corresponds to the coordinate frame of some three-dimensional
euclidean experimenter). away from the nonrelativistic limit, d 6= 1, so the variation of
spin is no longer exactly opposite to the rotation of the parallel transport frame.
now if d were to go to zero, the vector ~j would not rotate relative to the axis of the
tube. this would parallel the phenomenon described by chiao and wu. however, d is never
zero in the lowest energy subspace. even for m = 0, d  0.767. we obtain a complete
description of d as a function of mr by solving for the lowest root of the eigenvalue condition

the eect of the factor d on the vector ~j has a simple geometric interpretation. as an
example, consider a tube whose dening curve lies in a plane and such that it has two straight
sections, |s|  s0, joined by a section with constant curvature  and center of curvature
p . 1 in addition, construct a complementary tube parameterized by the same arc-length
parameter s satisfying the following conditions: it is parallel to the rst for s  s0; it has a
section of constant curvature d with center of curvature p for |s| < s0; and it has another
straight section for s  s0. the smaller curvature implies a larger radius of curvature. the
eect of the depolarizing factor can be summarized by the following construction: as the
dirac particle traverses the curved section of the tube, the vector ~j remains xed relative to
the tangent of the complementary curve at the corresponding value of s. for m = 0, if the
tube curves through  = 2, then ~j falls behind the tangent by approximately 1.534 .

in our formalism, we have used the boundary condition eq. (1) to simulate a hard-wall
potential barrier. many of the qualitative features of our results follow from the fact that spin
is not a good quantum number for the dirac equation subject to such a boundary condition.
it is natural to ask how sensitive these results are to the specic choice of conning boundary
condition. an obvious generalization given in eq. (2) is characterized by a chiral angle . we
have chosen  = 0 throughout; let us now take  6= 0. if we set  = ei5/2, we can map
this version back to the original boundary condition at the cost of introducing a chiral
mass term into the dirac equation:

1actually, we require the transition from zero to nonzero curvature to occur smoothly over a long
enough interval that the adiabatic approximation is applicable.

repeating the calculations in the earlier sections shows that the sole eect of the chiral
angle is to replace m by m cos  in the expression for the parameter  and thus implicitly
in the boundary conditions and depolarizing factor. thus the analysis above, with an
eective mass m cos , applies to this family of problems. in fact, for cos   0, the plot
in fig. (2) describes the depolarizing factor as a function of mr cos . when mr cos 
becomes negative new phenomena arise. in particular, the boundary condition eq. (2) acts
like an eective attractive potential at r = r. as a result for suciently negative mr cos 
a qualitatively new solution appears in each partial wave, which is bound to r = r and
decays exponentially as r decreases. the detailed study of these states is beyond the scope
of this paper.

in addition to these boundary conditions, there are other families of boundary condi-
tions that conne the probability current but which we have not yet considered in detail.
specically one can generalize eq. (2) by the condition

 i~  n = e

(48)

where  is any antihermitian dirac matrix that anticommutes with ~  n.  need not be
constant, as the demonstration of probability connement involves only algebraic manipu-
lations. interesting alternatives include 1 = 5(s), 2 = ~  t and 3 = ~  t  r. each
of these choices will generate dierent, nontrivial spin eects. thus we believe that the
essential feature of nontrivial spin transport should not be unique to our choice of boundary
condition. another direction of possible future work is the generalization of our approach
to higher-dimensional spaces, as has been done with the nonrelativistic theory.
