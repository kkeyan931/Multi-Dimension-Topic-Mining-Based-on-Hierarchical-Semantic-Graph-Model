abstract

the relativistic two-body system in (1 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics is studied .
it is proved that the eigenvalue problem for the two-body hamiltonian without the self-interaction
terms reduces to the problem of solving an one-dimensional stationary schrodinger type equation
with an energy-dependent eective potential which includes the -functional and inverted oscillator
parts. the conditions determining the metastable energy spectrum are derived, and the energies and
widths of the metastable levels are estimated in the limit of large particle masses. the eects of the
self-interaction are discussed.

1 introduction

in the study of two-body systems in quantum theory we often use single-particle equations. for
hydrogenlike systems, for instance, we assume that one of the particles is much heavier (proton) and
then reduce the two-body problem to the problem of motion of the lighter particle (electron) in an
external eld of the heavier one. to get more exact solution we need to take into account two-body
eects and start with a two-body equation.

as shown in [1], in (1 + 1)-dimensions the single-particle dirac equation allows no hydrogen. the
equation has solutions for a continuous set of energies, and the probability of nding the electron
innitely separated from the proton remains nite at all times. despite the attractive force, the
electron and proton are not conned in a hydrogenlike system with discrete energy levels. that
happens not only for hydrogen atoms with an innitely heavy source of potential, but also for
positroniumlike systems.

in the present paper, we want to clarify to what extent the two-body eects inuence the result of
[1]. we aim to study a relativistic two-body system in (1 + 1)-dimensional quantum electrodynamics
(qed) by making use of a two-body dirac equation. models in (1 + 1)-dimensions are known to
be useful as simpler models for discussion of many-body aspects of particle physics, in particular,
spontaneous positron production by supercritical potentials [2, 3].

to describe two-body systems we usually introduce a composite eld, and there are two ways of
deriving equations on this eld. if we rewrite the action of the two-body system entirely in terms of
the composite eld, then we can require the action to be stationary with respect to the variations
of this eld only. this way leads to a single two-body equation [4] - [6]. however, if we rst vary
the action with respect to the individual elds, then we come to a pair of coupled equations on the
composite eld. the pair of dirac equations formulation of the two-body problem was given in [7, 8]
in the framework of the constrait approach. the main dierence between the two ways is in the role
of the relative energy ( or its conjugate variable, the relative time). while in the rst way the relative
energy drops out of the two-body equation automatically, in the pair of dirac equations formulation
it is eliminated by using the compatibility condition of the two equations and a special choice of the
interaction potential.

in our paper we follow the single two-body equation formulation and work in the rst-quantized
version of qed when both matter and electromagnetic elds are not quantized. we consider a system
of two massive dirac elds minimally coupled to a u(1) or electromagnetic eld. the electromagnetic
eld has no separate local degrees of freedom and can be eliminated between the coupled maxwell-
dirac equations, but then nonlinear self-eld terms must be included.
in sect. 2, we derive a
relativictic two-body equation in the self-eld qed1+1 dened on the line and give the hamiltonian
form of this equation.
in sect. 3, we nd the eigenfunctions and the spectrum of the two-body
hamiltonian. we study in detail two cases: i) free motion; ii) the coulomb interaction, and discuss
the eects of the self-interaction. sect. 4 contains our conclusions.

for our system, the action is

where (,  = 0, 1), 0 = i2, 01 = 5 = 3, i (i = 1, 3) are pauli matrices. the elds k are
two-component dirac spinors, and k = 
k0. the partial derivatives are dened as 0 = /ct,
1 = /x.

the electromagnetic eld equations deduced from the action (2.1) are

where the total matter current

is conserved, j  = 0.

f  = j ,

j  =

xk=1

kk

in the coulomb gauge a1(x, t) = 0, the equations (2.2) take the form

2
1 a0 = j 0,
10a0 = j 1.

(2.2)

these two equations reduce in fact to each other because of the total current conservation and are
solved by

dyd(x, y)j 0(y, t),

(2.3)

where the greens function is

a0(x, t) = z 



d(x, y) =

1
2|x  y|.

in contrast with the situation on the circle, the electromagnetic eld on the line has not a global
physical degree of freedom and can be therefore eliminated from the action completely. if we insert
(2.3) into eq.(2.1), we obtain the action in the coulomb gauge as

(2.4)

we could vary the action (2.4) with respect to individual elds 1 and 2 separately. this
results in non-linear coupled hartree-type equations for these elds. instead, we use a relativistic
conguration space formalism [4, 5] to take into account the long-range quantum correlations. we
dene a composite eld  by

(x1, t|x2, t)  1(x1, t)  2(x2, t)

which is a four-component spinor eld. the conguration space (x1, x2) is two-dimensional euclidean
space r2.

we can rewrite our action (2.4) entirely in terms of the composite eld . the resultant action

is [9]

the self-potentials self
(k) being non-linear integral expressions. the spin matrices are written here in
the form of tensor products  , the rst factor always referring to the spin space of particle 1, the
second to particle 2.
now we require the action (2.5) to be stationary not with respect to the variation of the individual
elds but with respect to the composite eld only. this leads to the following two-body wave equation

{((1),  m1c)  0 + 0  ((2),  m2c)

in the center of mass and relative coordinates

 = (1) + (2)
p = p(1) + p(2)
x+ = x1 + x2

,  = (1)  (2),
, p = p(1)  p(2),
, x = x1  x2,

the function d(x1, x2) becomes

1
2|x|,
i.e. depends only on the relative coordinate x and is symmetric.

d(x1, x2) = d(x) =

the two-body equation , rst without the self-eld terms, takes the form

(cid:20)p + kp +

e1e2

(0  0)d(x)  m1ci  0  m2c0  i(cid:21) (x, t|x+, t) = 0,

(  0 + 0  ),
(  0  0  ),

and i is identity matrix. we see that k0 vanishes which means that the relative energy p0 drops out
of the equation automatically and we get

(cid:20)0p 0  1p 1  k1p1 +

e1e2

c

(0  0)d(x)  m1ci  0  m2c0  i(cid:21) (x, t|x+, t) = 0.

(2.7)

thus we have only one time variable conjugate to the center of mass energy 1
c p 0, one degree of freedom
for the center of mass momentum p 1 and one degree of freedom for the relative momentum p1. since
p 0 is the hamiltonian of the system, by multiplying (2.7) by 1
0 we obtain the hamiltonian form
of the two-body equation

p0 = (cid:18)+p 1 + p1

and the relative and center of mass terms in the hamiltonian p0 being additive:

p0 = hc.m. + hrel,
hc.m.  +p 1,
e1e2

d + 1m1c + 2m2c.

eq.(2.8) has the form of a generalized dirac equation, now a four-component wave equation.

with the self-potential terms the hamiltonian form of the two-body equation becomes

where

the self-potentials break in general the above mentioned additivity of the center of mass and relative
parts of p0.

3 spectrum

let us nd the eigenfunctions and the spectrum of p0. the equation for the eigenfunctions is

(+p 1 + p1 + 1m1c + 2m2c) =

(e + ),

if we denote the components of the composite eld  as

11  1
21  3

, 12  2,
, 22  4,

then (3.1) reduces to the system of four equations:

(  + e)1 = m1c3  m2c2,

(  + e)3 = m1c1 + m2c4.


1(e, e1, e2) = 4(e, e1, e2),


2(e, e1, e2) = 3(e, e1, e2),

(3.2a)

(3.2b)

(3.3a)

(3.3b)

i.e. only half of all solutions of eqs.(3.2a) - (3.2b) are independent and correspond to physical
particles.

it is more convenient to introduce the combinations

  2  3,
  1  4,

and use them instead of the original componenets i (i = 1, 4). the system of equations (3.2a-b)
takes the form

without loss of generality, we can take masses equal to each other, m1 = m2  m. then the

eigenfunctions  and  are determined by + and +, respectively,

while + and + are related by

acting on (3.5a) by t and on (3.5b) by t+, we easily decouple + and + and rewrite (3.5a-b)

equivalently as

t+t+ = 4m2c2+,

tt++ = 4m2c2+.

(3.7a)

in what follows we assume for the eigenfunctions the ansatz

(x, x+) = exp(cid:18) i
(x, x+) = exp(cid:18) i

h

h

pcmx+(cid:19) (x),
pcmx+(cid:19) (x),

i.e. separate their x+-dependent part from the x-dependent one. here pcm is a momentum conjugate
to the center of mass coordinate x+, so we can call it the center of mass motion momentum.

if we neglect both mutual and self-interactions, i.e. put  = 0, then we get a system of two free

particles. the relations (3.3a-b) become

3.1 free motion

1(e) = 4(e),
2(e) = 3(e),

i.e. the negative energy solutions of 1 and 2 coincide correspondingly with the positive energy
solutions of 4 and 3. therefore we may consider either positive and negative energy solutions of 1
and 2 or only positive energy solutions of all four equations (3.2a-b) as physical particles.

for  = 0, the operators t and t+ commute, so eqs.(3.7a) and (3.7b) coincide with each other.

their solution is

3.2 coulomb interaction

let us now consider our two-body system in the presence of the coulomb interaction and neglect

only self-eld terms. the relations (3.3a-b) take the form

1(e,e1e2) = 4(e, e1e2),
2(e,e1e2) = 3(e, e1e2),

i.e. the negative energy solutions of 1 and 2 coincide correspondingly with the positive energy
solutions of 4 and 3 of opposite sign of e1e2.

for  = , the equation (3.7a) for + reduces to the second order dierential equation

the last term in the potential represents the center of mass motion contribution which vanishes for
pcm = 0 as well as for all values of pcm in the massless case.

the explicit form of the potential for pcm = 0 is

the potential v (x) has several pecularities. first, it contains a -functional part with coecient
(1/s) , positive ( for e1e2 > 0 and e < 0 or e1e2 < 0 and e > 0 ) or negative ( for e1e2 > 0 and
e > 0 or e1e2 < 0 and e < 0 ). the form of v (x) for dierent signs of the -function coecient is
shown in figures 2 and 3. secondly, its regular part v (x) includes the inverted x2-potential (the
last term in eq.(3.10) ). such kind of potentials is known to appear in barrier penetration problems,
splitting in double wells, and tunneling out of traps [10]- [12]. the systematic study of the inverted
oscillator is given in [13]. the presence of the inverted x2-potential makes v (x) nonvanishing at
|x|   and indicates that the particles are not conned in a stable system.
the regular part v (x) is symmetric with respect to x, v (x) = v (x). for very small
non-zero x, |x|  |s| , v (x) is approximately linear

 = a1 + b2,

where a and b are arbitrary constants, and use the matching condition (3.11) which in terms of z
becomes

regardless of values of the constants a and b,  does not vanish at |z|   and can not represent
bound states. for b + ia = 0, the solution behaves at innity as a diverging wave. such behaviour
is specic for metastable states. the condition determining the metastable (or quasi-discrete) energy
levels is then

metastable states are described by complex values of energy

there are therefore four metastable energy levels in the band between the positive and negative

energy continuums, the rst two at the energies e(1)
two at the energies close to zero, e(2)

the rst two metastable energy levels turn into stable ones, (1)  0, while the second two disappear,
(2)  .
for e1e2 > 0, the positive energy metastable levels correspond to the relative motion in the
potential v (x) with s > 0, while the negative energy ones in the potential with s < 0. for e1e2 < 0,
the metastable energy levels are positive for s < 0 and negative for s > 0.

in the massless case ( = 0), the solutions 1 and 2 become trigonometric functions

tg(cid:18) z0

2hc(cid:19) =

.

this condition does not x e0, while for the level width we get  = . this means that in the
massless case there are neither discrete nor quasi-discrete energy levels and the energy spectrum is
continuous.

the spectrum for + can be derived analogously. it can be shown that the equation (3.7b) for

+ also reduces to the schrodinger type equation with the potential

the structure of the spectrum for + is the same as in the case of +. for innitely large values of m,
the spectrums for + and + coincide exactly, while for large and nite values of m, the corrections
of the order (1/) and (1/2) are dierent.

3.3 self-interaction

the self-interaction makes the spectrum problem essentially more complicated. let us give here

a few comments concerning the eects of the self-eld terms.

12

with the self-potentials self

(2) , the function f depends on both coordinates x and x+, and
the operators t acquire additional terms including the partial derivative (f /x+). moreover, we
can not assume, as before in the study of the coulomb interaction, that the center of mass motion
is free, with a momentum pcm. this results in innitely large values of the self-potentials.

(1) , self

indeed, in terms of the components i (i = 1, 4) the self-potentials take the form

self
(1) (x) =

self
(2) (x) =

e1

e2



2 z 
2 z 





dyz 
dyz 



dy+d(cid:18)x,
dy+d(cid:18)x,

1
2

1
2

(y+ + y)(cid:19)
(y+  y)(cid:19)

4

4

xi=1
xi=1


i (y, y+)i(y, y+),


i (y, y+)i(y, y+).

for the free center of mass motion,


i (y, y+)i(y, y+) = 

i (y)i(y),



dy+d(cid:16)x, 1

2(y+  y)(cid:17) diverge.

so the integrals r 
we can not assume also that the dependence of the components on the coordinates x and x+
is factorized, because for a general form of f (x, x+) such factorization is simply not valid. even in
the case of the purely coulomb interaction the factorization takes place only when the motion of the
center of mass is free. to prove that let us use for a moment the following ansatz for the components
+ and +:

+(x, x+) = +(x+)+(x),
+(x, x+) = +(x+)+(x).

with f =  + e, the equation (3.5a) gives

+(x+) = +(x+),

while the equation (3.5b) becomes

1

+(x+)

d2+
dx2
+

=

f 2+(x)  2f mc2+(x)

4h2c2+(x)

.

since the left-hand side of this equation depends only on x+ and the right-hand one only on x ,
both sides must be equal to an arbitrary constant. choosing the constant as (p 2

cm/h2), we get

+(x+) = exp(cid:18) i

h

pcmx+(cid:19) ,

the factor corresponding to the free motion of the center of mass (if the constant is taken
cm, where rcm is a parameter of the dimension of length, then we come to the factors

i.e.
positive, say 1/r2
exp (x+/rcm) which diverge at positive or negative innity and are therefore unacceptable ).
the self-potentials are usually calculated by iteration procedure. to lowest order of iteration we
solve the spectrum problem without the self-eld terms. then we substitute the solution obtained
into the expressions for the self-potentials, calculate these potentials explicitly and use them in the
next order of iteration. thus, to get nite expressions for the self-potentials and to continue the
iteration procedure we need at the lowest order, i.e.
in the coulomb interaction case, a general
solution of the problem without the assumption of the free motion of the center of mass.

4 discussion

1. we have shown that the spectrum problem for the two-body hamiltonian in (1+1)-dimensional
qed reduces to the problem of solving a system of two second-order partial dierential equations . if
the center of mass motion of the two-body system is assumed to be free, then these equations govern
only the relative motion and take the form of one-dimensional stationary schrodinger type equations
with energy-dependent potentials which include the -functional and inverted ocsillator parts .

we have solved the problem in the case of equal masses and the self-potentials neglected, and
derived the conditions determining the metastable energy levels. we have estimated the energies and
widths of the metastable levels for large values of mass. for the vanishing mass, neither stable nor
metastable levels exist, and the energy spectrum is continuous.

2. our consideration on the basis of the two-body equation without the self-eld terms does
not change the result of the single-particle dirac equation approach, namely, the nonexistence of
hydrogenlike systems in (1 + 1)-dimensions. however, the two-body equation, even with the self-
interaction neglected, provides essentially new details: for limited times the particles can be conned
in a metastable system characterized by quasi-discrete energy levels. for large values of the particle
masses, the metastable system does not decay for a long time, and its spectrum is close to a discrete
one.

to treat the problem completely it is necessary to take into account in the two-body equation
the self-potentials. it is also of a principal importance to consider the center of mass motion as a
nite one, since for the free motion case the self-potentials take innitely large values. this work is
in progress.
