abstract

compact canonical quantization on the light cone (dlcq) is examined in the limit
of innite periodicity lenth l. pauli jordan commutators are found to approach con-
tinuum expressions with marginal non causal terms of order l3/4 traced back to the
handling of ir divergence through the elimination of zero modes. in contrast direct
quantization in the continuum (clcq) in terms of eld operators valued distribu-
tions is shown to provide the standard causal result while at the same time ensuring
consistent ir and uv renormalization.

1 introduction

light front quantization has emerged as an important tool in the study of non-perturbative
aspects of eld theories [1]. however a major problem in this approach resides in the
infrared behaviour of the continuum theory. recently this issue was claried on the basis
of a mathematically well dened procedure [2]. in the early attempts to deal with these
infrared problems, discretized light front quantization (dlcq) [3] has played an important
role. the popularity of dlcq resides in the easy and conceptually simple treatment of the
infrared regularisation : zero modes in the expansion of the elds were simply eliminated
and later on understood as the lc-counterpart of the non-trivial ground state of equal-time
(et) quantization. the study of critical phenomena in the framework of eective theories
requires using a continuum version of the quantum eld theory on the light front. indeed
critical points, critical exponents etc... are accessible only from a complete knowledge of the
cut-o dependence of the critical mass, which can only be given by the continuum theory.
in dlcq the limit of innite periodicity length l cannot be achieved in a straightforward
manner without further insights both on the handling of zero modes and restoration of
covariance and causality in the limiting process. our approach [2] was to propose a genuine
continuum treatment (clcq) in which elds are treated as operator valued distributions,
thereby leading to a well dened handling of ultravioled and light cone induced infrared
divergences and of their renormalization. we focussed in [2] on the comparison of the critical
coupling in the lc and et-framework, showing that the continuum non-perturbative lc-
approach is no more complex than usual perturbation theory in lowest order. the lc-critical
coupling is in essential agreement with the rg-improved perturbative result at fourth order.
here we want to report on a detailed comparison between dlcq and clcq treatments
of important quantities like pauli-jordan commutator functions, which, due to necessary
concision and lack of space, could not be treated therein.

in section 2 we recall the dlcq and clcq fock expansion of the eld operators and
the resulting pauli-jordan eld commutators. a detailed comparison of their behaviour in
terms of the periodicity length l (e.g.
intrinsic cut-o ) is made in section 3 where the
issue of covariance and causality is also discussed in the limiting process l  . some
conclusions and perpectives are presented in section 4.

2 dlcq and clcq eld operators and commutators

dlcq was introduced [3] to resolve the zero mode problem. this mode is clearly isolated
from other modes and its explicit treadtment results in a zero-mode constraint, the so-
lution of which carries the non-perturbative aspects of the theory. in the particle sector,
periodic boundary conditions are imposed, l being the periodicity length, leading to the
usual fock expansion. restricting to 1 + 1 dimension1 the particle sector eld writes

(x) =

1

4n



xn=1

(2.1)

with

and

[an, a+

m] = n,m , n, m  1;

kn =

, n  z.

1for massive eld the ir-problematics can be discussed independently of higher dimensionalities.

the clcq approach relies on the introduction of eld operator-valued distributions dened
with respect to c-test functions with compact support [4]. apart from formal considera-
tions there exists a fondamental physical argument which demonstrates that it is compelling
to treat the eld amplitudes in the distributional sense in order to guarantee that the lc
quantization procedure by itself is correct. due to the hyperbolic form of the lc-laplacian,
initial eld values have to the prescribed on characteristics, i.e. on x+ = 0 and x = 0. in
order to be able to transform this characteristic value problem into a problem with periodic
boundary conditions, test functions f (p+, p) have to be introduced with the property [5]

lim
p+0

1
p+ f (p+,

m2
p+ ) = 0

(2.2)

(see eq. (3.20) of ref. [5]).

this is exactly what happens automatically with the test functions dened below. condi-
tion (2.2) ensures, as discussed in detail in ref. [5], that the eld values on the characteristic
x = 0 become dependent quantities and, as a consequence, the quantization can be per-
formed prescribing boundary values for x+ = 0 at x = l and x = l, where l  .
the eld can be expressed in a chart independent way as a surface integral over a manifold,
thereby showing that the ultraviolet (uv) behaviour on the minkowski manifold dictates
the uv and ir behaviour on the lc manifold. this is due to the regularisation properties
of the test function which are automatically transfered from the rst to the second case.

in this context the eld writes

lc(x) =z 

0

dp+
4p+ [a(p+)eip.x + a+(p+)eip.x]flc(p+, p(p+))

(2.3)

with

[a(p+), a+(p+)] = 4p+(p+  p+).

in (2.2) p(p+) stands for the on-shell condition m2/p+ and flc is the test function in
momentum space which falls o with all its derivatives suciently fast as a function of the
its behaviour as
minkowski arguments p0, pz
1
a function of p+ is discussed in [2] : the singular behaviour of
p+ in (2.2) is completely
damped out by the behabiour of flc for p+  0, eliminating p+ = 0 as an accumulation
point. the ensuing renormalization is independent of the particular choice of flc.
we examine rst the pauli jordan communator (x) = [(x), (0)] evaluated at x+ = 0.

near the origin gb(x) rises to 1 over distances shorter with increasing . it is followed
by an oscillatory fall-o with an average slope in 1
 , corresponding to the straight line of
ga(x) in dlcq. finally for large values of x ( 10) gb(x) remains oscillating around
zero.
hence in both cases the decay zone and the asymptotic region where g(x) is null or
quasi-null, reect the elimination of the zero mode, n = 0 for dlcq and a halo around
p+ = 0 for clcq. however it is the presence of the uv-regularisation in clcq which is
responsible for the smeared out rise near x = 0 and small short wave length oscillations
for small x, at variance with dlcq where no such regularisation is present. clearly the
n-summation can be arbitrarily cutt-o to deal with the uv-divergence but the approach
to the continuum is not under control since the limiting procedure of innite cutt-o and

4

innite periodicity length compatible with causality is not known. to discuss these points
we examine now the commutator for space or time like separation.

for dlcq we have

dlcq(x+, x) =

m2x+
p+ + p+x] f 2(p+).

(3.2)

(3.3)

the integral in (3.3) is convergent even if f = 1 everywhere and a straightforward change
of the integration variable shows that clcq depends only on the product x+x. the limit
   can be taken safely with the result

clcq(x+, x) = 

i
4

[sign(x+) + sign(x)]j0(mx+x),

(3.4)

which is the correct causal covariant expression, with j0(x) the bessel function of order
zero.

clearly for dlcq the limit l   cannot be taken before the sum is carried out, as
the sinus becomes ill-dened. as shown in appendix a this limit requires some care. using
eq.(a.19) one nds

dlcq(x+, x)(cid:12)(cid:12)l =

4

+

2mlx+px+x + 2lx+sign(x+)j1(mpx+x + 2lx+sign(x+) + o(l5/4)
hence the causal covariant expression is retrieved in the limit l  . however the
marginal non causal term in j1 in eq.(3.4) originates from the elimination of the zero mode
x
in the innite sum of eq.(3.2) (for x+ = 0 it is just i
l , cf. eq(2.4)). its disappearance
4
as l   indicates that in the continuum the infrared problems would remain at variance
with clcq. thus in dlcq, l has to be kept nite to achieve ir regularisation, at the
expense of the appearance of a causality violating term of order (l3/4). due to the reg-
ularisation properties of the test functions, the situation in clcq is far more satisfactory
since the approach provides a well dened handling of uv and ir-divergences and of their
renormalization.

(3.5)

4 conclusion

it has been shown that dynamical properties of lc-quantized scalar elds whose basic
manifestation is in the pauli-jordan commutator function dier essentially if quantized in
dlcq or in the continuum. dlcq on a nite interval yields causality violating terms
being proportional to l3/4 which come in addition to the frame independent result of the
continuum theory. unfortunately this does not mean that the two versions coincide in the
limit l   since in this limit the infrared regularisation of dlcq is lost.
to conclude we want to add a remark concerning the lc-lattice method introduced by
destri and de vega [6] and elaborated by faddeev and coworkers [7]. this approach works on

5

a lc-space-time lattice. the basic building blocks of eld dynamics being causal transfer
matrices between neighbouring points along light-like directions, problems with causality
are avoided by construction in this discretization scheme. however the main argument in
favour of this approach lies in the integrability properties in closest connection to those of
the continuum.
