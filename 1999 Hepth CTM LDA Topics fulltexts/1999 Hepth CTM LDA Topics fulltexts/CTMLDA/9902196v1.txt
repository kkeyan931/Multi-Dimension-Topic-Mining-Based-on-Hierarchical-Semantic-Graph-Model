abstract

using boundary states we derive the presence of (chiral) fermions on the
intersection of type 0 d-branes. the corresponding anomalous couplings on
the branes are then computed. furthermore, we discuss systems of branes
sitting at an singularities. in particular, the massless spectrum on the branes
is derived, and a boundary state description is given.

1 introduction

type 0 string theories [1] have recently attracted a lot of attention. the hope is that
information on non-supersymmetric gauge theories can be extracted by embedding
them in a non-supersymmetric string theory [2, 3].

in the notation of ref.

[4] the type ii string theories contain the following

sectors:

iib :
iia :

(ns+, ns+) (r+, r+) (r+, ns+) (ns+, r+)
(ns+, ns+) (r+, r) (r+, ns+) (ns+, r) .

here the signs denote worldsheet fermion number. there is another, equivalent
choice for both theories (related to the rst choice by a spacetime reection):

iib :
iia :

(ns+, ns+) (r, r) (r, ns+) (ns+, r)
(ns+, ns+) (r, r+) (r, ns+) (ns+, r+) .

for the massless r-r sector the dierence between the primed and unprimed
theories shows up in opposite chiralities of the bispinor containing the r-r eld
strengths. this implies a sign dierence in the poincare duality relations among
these eld strengths, resulting in a selfdual ve-form eld strength in iib and an
antiselfdual one in iib, for instance.

in this paper we will be interested in type 0 theories, in which the following

sectors are combined:

0b :
0a :

(ns+, ns+) (ns, ns) (r+, r+) (r, r)
(ns+, ns+) (ns, ns) (r+, r) (r, r+) .

these theories do not contain spacetime fermions.1 the inclusion of the ns-ns
sectors with odd fermion numbers means that the closed string tachyon is not
projected out. the third dierence with type ii theories is that the r-r spectrum
is doubled: the r-r potentials of the primed and unprimed type ii theories are
combined, resulting in an unconstrained ve-form eld strength, for instance.

because of the doubling of the r-r spectrum, there are both electric and mag-
netic d3-branes, as opposed to the selfdual one of type iib. the recent literature
has developed in two main directions. first, the gauge theory on a superposition
of a large number of electric branes was studied, leading to non-supersymmetric,
non-conformal, tachyon-free gauge theories [2, 6, 7]. second, equal numbers of elec-
tric and magnetic d3-branes were superposed, giving a non-supersymmetric large
n conformal eld theory [3, 8, 9].

in this paper we will be mostly interested in the second situation. a super-
position of equally many electric and magnetic branes is reminiscent of the type
ii branes, which have been well-studied. it will turn out that a lot of results can
be transferred to type 0 almost without eort. for instance, chiral fermions are
present on certain intersections of electric and magnetic branes, leading to anomaly
inow on the intersection via anomalous d-brane couplings. these in turn lead to
the creation of a string when certain d-branes cross each other.

a second point of interest will be an orbifold of the large n cft of ref.

[3].
the massless spectrum of equally many electric and magnetic type 0 branes at an
an orbifold singularity will be derived and a boundary state description of this
derivation will be given. the large n conformal invariance of the resulting gauge
theory will be illustrated by a two loop computation of the gauge coupling beta
function.

we have organized the remainder of this paper as follows. in section 2 d-branes
in type 0 theories are quickly reviewed. section 3 contains our analysis of anomaly
inow on type 0 brane intersections and related issues. section 4 discusses the
spectrum of the orbifold cft, its large n conformal invariance and the boundary
state description. our conclusions are collected in section 5.

1however, fermions will occur when d-branes are introduced [5]. this will be crucial for our

results.

2 d-branes in type 0 string theory

d-branes in type 0 theories have been discussed in refs [5] and [6]. in this section
we mainly review some of their results.

as discussed in the introduction, the type 0 theories have two (p + 1)-form r-r
potentials for each even (0a) or odd (0b) p. we will denote these by cp+1 and
cp+1, referring to the unprimed and primed type ii theories mentioned above. for
our purposes, a more convenient way to label these elds is

(cp+1) =

1
2

(cp+1  cp+1) .

(2.1)

for p = 3 these are the electric (+) and magnetic () potential [6]. we will adopt
this terminology also for other values of p.
there are four types of elementary d-branes for each p: an electric and a
magnetic one (i.e., charged under (cp+1)), and the corresponding antibranes. the
tension of those branes is a factor 2 smaller than for type ii branes, but they
couple to the corresponding r-r potentials (cp+1) with the same charge as the
branes in type ii couple to the potential cp+1. therefore the r-r repulsive force
between two like branes has the double strength of the graviton-dilaton attraction
[6].

in refs [6, 5] the interaction energy of two parallel (p + 1)-branes was computed
in various cases (electric-electric, electric-magnetic, . . . ) by computing the cylinder
diagram in the open string channel. in fact, these results can be reproduced using
the boundary state

|b, + >=

1
2

(|b, + >ns +|b, + >r)

for an electric brane, and

|b, >=

1
2

(|b, >ns +|b, >r)

(2.2)

(2.3)

for a magnetic one. here we are using the conventions and normalizations of refs
[10] and [11], which we will use troughout the paper.2 the  refers to the periodicity
conditions on the fermions at the boundary described by the boundary state, e.g.,

(m  is  m)|b,  >= 0 .

(2.4)

as a cross-check, with these boundary states it is easy to compute the one-point
function on the disc of a r-r potential (as in ref.
[12]), nding indeed the same
charge as in type ii (the factors 12 in eqs (2.1) and (2.2) are compensated by the
factor 2 one gets from not having to do the type ii gso projection).

2note that, in these conventions, the bra of an electric brane is given by < b,| and its ket by

|b, + >.

3 anomaly inow and wess-zumino action

the d-branes described in the previous section have been very similar to their type
ii cousins. in this section we will push the analogy further to include the whole
wess-zumino action, i.e., all the anomalous d-brane couplings3. we will do this in
two ways, rst by repeating the anomaly inow argument of refs [13, 14], and second
by repeating the explicit computation of scattering amplitudes of closed string elds
on the disc [11, 15, 16] (see ref. [17] for an alternative string computation of these
terms).

the open strings stretching between two like branes are bosons, just like the bulk
elds of type 0. however, fermions appear from strings between an electric and a
magnetic brane [5]. thus one could wonder whether there are chiral fermions on the
intersection of an electric and a magnetic brane. consider such an orthogonal inter-
section with no overall transverse directions. if the dimension of the intersection is
two or six, a cylinder computation reveals that there are precisely enough fermionic
degrees of freedom stretching between the branes to form one chiral fermion, which
is also what was found in the type ii case.

thus the gauge and gravitational anomalies on the intersection match the ones
for type ii. to cancel them, the minimal coupling of a dp-brane to a (p + 1)-form
r-r potential should be extended to the following wess-zumino action (see refs.
[13, 14] for the analogous discussion in type ii):

sw z =

tp

 zp+1

( c)  e2 f + b  q a(rt )/ a(rn ) .

(3.5)

here rt and rn are the curvatures of the tangent and normal bundles of the
d-brane worldvolume, and a denotes the a-roof genus:

a(rt )
a(rn )

n )2

+

(42)4
1843204 (tr r4

t  tr r4

n ) + . . .

(3.6)

the  in eq. (3.5) distinguishes between electric and magnetic branes. for the
other symbols and our conventions we refer to ref. [11]. note that tp denotes the
tension of a type ii dp-brane, which is 2 times the type 0 dp-brane tension.

the argument that the variation of this action4 cancels the anomaly on the
intersection is a copy of the one in refs [13, 14], apart from one slight subtlety.
for deniteness, consider the intersection of an electric and a magnetic d5-brane
on a string. varying the electric d5-brane action (exhibiting the (c2)+ potential,
or rather, its eld strength (h3)+), one nds that the variation is localized on the

3and the non-anomalous ones found in ref. [16]
4to be precise one should use an action expressed in terms of the r-r eld strengths instead

of the potentials, which is dierent from eq. (3.5). [13, 14]

intersection of the electric d5-brane with branes charged magnetically under the
(h3)+ eld strength. now the discussion in the introduction about the dierence
between ii and ii shows that these are precisely the branes carrying (electric)
(h7) charge, i.e., what we called the magnetic d5-branes. a completely anal-
ogous discussion goes through for the variation of the magnetic d5-brane action.
schematically (see [13, 14] for more details),

(h3)  3 = zd5

d(h3)+  i2 = zd5+
d(h3)  i2 = zd5

d  (h7)  i2 = zd5+
d  (h7)+  i2 = zd5

d5  i2
d5+  i2 .

this anomaly inow argument xes (the anomalous part of) the wess-zumino
action, displayed in eq. (3.5). the presence of these terms (and of a similar non-
anomalous one [16]) can be checked by a disc computation, as in type ii [11, 15, 16].
in fact, again up to the cancelling factors mentioned at the end of the previous
section, the computation is precisely the same, conrming the form of the action
(3.5).

assuming t-duality to hold between type 0a/b, the arguments of ref. [18] lead
to the creation of a fundamental string when certain electric and magnetic branes
cross each other. in type ii this is linked to the hanany-witten eect [19] by a
chain of dualities. however, this chain involves s-duality, of which we do not know
a type 0 analogue.

4 type 0 branes at an orbifold xed point

we now want to consider a system of n electric and n magnetic type 0 d5-branes,
localized at the xed point of a c2/ orbifold,  being a discrete subgroup of su(2).
here we discuss explicitely the case  = n. by dimensional reduction on a torus
t2, this corresponds to n d3+ and n d3 branes. this eld content, or at least its
massless part, can be derived as follows. first, consider a conguration of 2n type
ii d3 branes with transverse space c2/ t2, a conguration discussed in ref. [20]
in terms of n  2n branes in the orbifold covering space. second, perform on it
the projection with respect to ()fs i discussed in ref. [3] for at space. fs is the
space-time fermion number and i acts as conjugation by 3 in the space of n  n
blocks obtained by separating each group of 2n type ii branes into n electric and
n magnetic type 0 ones.

the spectrum of the open strings stretching between the type ii branes falls into
n = 2, d = 4 supermultiplets. there are n vector multiplets for dierent su(2n)
groups, and n hypermultiplets that transform each in the bifundamental of a couple
of su(2n) factors, as encoded in a type ii quiver diagram [20], see fig. 1(a).
after the ()fs i projection, the eld content is as follows. the massless bosons
are:

we will introduce shortly, see fig. 1(b).

the massless fermionic content is equivalent to that of

 n weyl fermions, each in the ((n, 1), (1, n)) + (( n, 1), (1, n)) of a couple of

gauge factors as encoded in the type 0 diagram of fig. 1(b).

the type 0 quiver diagram that summarizes the information about the spectrum
requires only a slight modication of the quiver rules in ref. [20]. for instance, in
n case, one draws n pairs consisting of a lled and an empty dot, representing
our
the groups of electric and magnetic branes, respectively; one draws then oriented
links between any two dots in neighbouring or same pairs. the spectrum can be
read o using the following rules:

1. every dot represents the bosonic content of an su(n) vector multiplet.

2. every link connecting two like dots corresponds to spacetime bosons.

3. every link between an empty and a lled dot corresponds to spacetime fermions.

4. a link represents the bosonic or fermionic truncation of either a vectormultiplet
(in the case of links within a pair) or half a hypermultiplet (for links from one
pair to a neighbouring one), transforming in the bifundamental of the gauge
groups corresponding to the dots it connects.

the origin of these rules is self-explanatory from ref.
type 0.

4.1 closed string description

we have seen in sec. 2 how the type 0 boundary states are related to the unprojected
type ii ones, and how they can be useful.

in this subsection, we briey discuss the unprojected boundary state for a d-
brane at an orbifold singularity (see [21]), which enables us to compute the cylinder
amplitude between two d-branes in the closed string channel. we proceed further
to give a prescription for including in this computation the eect of a non-trivial
action of the orbifold group on the chan-paton factors. we focus for concreteness
on d5-branes on c2/ n, i.e., on the theory considered in the previous section (before
dimensional reduction on t2).

the orbifold is dened by the action of the

n generator on the two coordinates
(x, y) of c2: (x, y)  (x, 1y), where  = exp(2i/n). as a consequence (see e.g.
[22]) the theory possesses n closed string sectors, distinguished by the periodicity
properties of the elds:

{x, y, x, y }(,  + 2) = {lx, ly, lx, ly }(, ) .

(4.7)

the modings of the respective left and right moving oscillators, {, , , }
and { , , , }, are generically shifted from integer values: ,   + l/n and
,    l/n (plus of course an additional shift of 1/2 for the fermionic oscillators
in the ns sector). in the following we give explicit expressions for the x and x
parts, those for y and y being obtained simply by the replacement   1.
sector by a boundary state that satises
(x (l) + x (l))| =0|b; li = 0 ,

a d5-brane localized at the orbifold xed point is represented in the l-th twisted

((l) + i (l))| =0|b; li = 0 ,

(4.8)

plus conjugate relations and plus appropriate counterparts on y, y and y , y . the
solution to these conditions in terms of oscillators reads

|bb; li = exp(cid:16)x

+ x

 
   i x



(cid:17)|0i ,

(cid:17)|0i ,


(4.9)

where the modings are as indicated below eq. (4.7) and, as usual, the fermionic
part of the boundary states depends on the additional sign  and diers in the r-r
or ns-ns sector. these boundary states have of course the usual expressions, see,
e.g, [10], for the elds in the neumann directions, and for ghost and superghosts,
which we do not write.5

5in twisted sectors, l 6= 0, we must take into account the fact that the only  ramond 0-modes
are those in the 6 neumann directions, and modify the zero-mode part of the r boundary states
appropriately. in the ns sector, additional  zero-modes should be taken into account in the
orbifold directions when l/n = 1/2.

7

let us suppose now to have many d-branes, which we can represent6 by many
boundary states, labeled by chan-paton indices. in the case we are interested
in, we group the d5-branes into n bunches of 2n each, and use thus a chan-paton
composite label m, a, with m = 0, . . . n  1 and a = 1, . . . 2n.
the cylinder amplitude between any two given d-branes, i.e., for xed chan-
paton indices, receives contributions from all the twisted sectors. in summing them
an ambiguity shows up: we can decide to weigh dierently the twisted contributions
depending on the chan-paton labels. this is the closed string counterpart of the
freedom one has in the open string picture to introduce a non-trivial action of the
orbifold group on the adjoint chan-paton factor. a particular non-trivial action,
corresponding to the regular representation, was considered in ref. [20]; for instance
in the c2/ n case the generator acts as (m, a; m, a)  mm(m, a; m, a) in a
convenient basis.7 in the closed string language, this is reproduced by dening the
cylinder amplitude to be8

where d is the closed string propagator and of course the r or ns fermions must be
distinguished. the computation of the amplitude (4.10) is rather straightforward,
and the nal result is

where v6 is the world-volume and we have i = 2 for the r-r sector with  = 1,
i = 3 for the ns-ns sector with  = 1 and i = 4 for the ns-ns sector with
 = 1. the r-r amplitude with  = 1 vanishes. in eq. (4.11) we have used
also the by now customary expressions fi( ) of [23]. in the case l = 0, m = 0 the
integrand in eq. (4.11) is actually rewritten as 2(fi/f1)8, the standard expression
for parallel d6-branes at zero transverse distance.

,

performing the modular transformation of the amplitude (4.11) should allow
us to recognize it as a 1-loop open string free energy. introducing  = 1/ , we
6only for certain purposes, as for instance our present one, the computation in the closed string
channel of the open string free energy at zero background: we are of course not able to describe
the true non-abelian boundary states.

7this regular action plays a crucial role in the argument of refs [9] that conformal invariance

is preserved in the large-n limit after orbifolding.

8we x the relative normalization of the boundary state in the various twisted sectors requiring
that, for instance in the case of a single d-brane, the modular transformation of the closed string
amplitude coincides with the free energy of open strings projected onto zn-invariant states (see
later). explicitely, the normalization in front of the boundary state is t (l)
5 =

n orbifold
action and moreover it has the regular action on the chan-paton indices discussed
above.

summarizing, the boundary state description of branes at an orbifold singularity
is also available in the case of a non-trivial action of the orbifold group on the
chan-paton factor, requiring only a corresponding non-trivially weighed sum over
the closed string twisted sectors, as in eq. (4.10). the description is available for
type 0 theories as well; notice that in eq. (4.11) the contribution from the various
parts (r-r or ns-ns, with  = ) are considered separately.

4.2 large n conformal invariance
in ref. [3] the non-supersymmetric sun)su(n) gauge theory on the worldvolume
of n d3 coincident with n d3+ branes was studied. the perturbative gauge
coupling beta-function for the theory was shown to vanish at large n up to two-loop
order. on general grounds [9] it has even been argued to vanish identically at large
n. this behaviour could have been anticipated from an ads-cft correspondence
as well [3].

putting the above brane system at an orbifold singularity as in the previous
[9]. a vanishing beta-function
section does not invalidate the arguments in ref.
can thus be anticipated in this case as well. nevertheless, we outline the explicit
evaluation of the two-loop gauge coupling beta-function, as it presents a check on
the spectrum derived above.

since the work of ref. [25] coecients for the beta-function in a general gauge
theory have been rather easy to extract from the eld spectrum, that is to say,
up to two-loop order. now concentrate on the d3 brane system at the orbifold
singularity. with the expressions from ref. [25] the above derived spectrum is seen

b2 = 24n 2 + 16 + y4 ;

(4.15)

after straightforward plug-in of numbers. we adopt the conventions of ref. [3]. as
was noticed in that reference one has to make sure to insert appropriate factors 2
whenever dealing with bifundamental representations.

the single non-trivial part of the calculation resides in the yukawa contribution.
in the analog type iib set-up the maximal supersymmetry in the gauge theory would
be reduced by half, whence only su(2)r  u(1) r-symmetry would remain from
the original su(4)r. as the present case is a truncation of the n = 4 theory,
the remaining yukawa couplings have the same numerical value as their n = 4
counterparts. careful analysis therefore reveals that
n 2  1
4n

y4 = 24  4n 

.

(4.16)

the factor 24 4n results from the combinatorics due to the various fermions run-
ning in the loops, whereas the remaining factor has a group-theoretical nature. if
it is known how the fermions and scalars transform under r-symmetry, the combi-
natorics are greatly simplied.

as expected, the yukawa contribution cancels the leading term in the two-
loop beta-function coecient. this is an explicit hint that this class of non-
supersymmetric theories is conformal at large n.

5 conclusions

in this paper we have identied the boundary states that describe type 0 d-branes.
from the relation with their type ii counterparts it was then easy to deduce the
presence of (chiral) fermions on intersections of type 0 d-branes. furthermore, we
have shown the existence of anomalous couplings on the branes, either relying on
the anomaly inow argument or by direct string computation.

in a somewhat separate development we have constructed the massless spectrum
of the eld theory on a superposition of electric and magnetic d3-branes sitting at
an orbifold singularity. the relevant cylinder amplitude has also been understood
from the boundary state point of view. we have illustrated large n conformal
invariance of this theory by explicit evaluation of the perturbative beta-function
(up to two loops).

in many respects type 0 string theory is the result of a clever way of breaking
in taking the orbifold from type ii to type 0 the resulting the-
supersymmetry.
ory, although non-supersymmetric, still exhibits features reminiscent of the parent
theory. from the strong resemblances between type ii and type 0 string theories,
one may hope to draw more conclusions about non-supersymmetric theories by
reinterpreting old results from supersymmetric string theory in this new context.
