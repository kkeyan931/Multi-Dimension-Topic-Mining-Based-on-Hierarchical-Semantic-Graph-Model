abstract

we develop an algorithm which can be used to exclude the existence of classical
breathers (periodic nite energy solutions) in scalar eld theories, and apply it to
several cases of interest. in particular, the technique is used to show that a pair of
potentially periodic solutions of the 3+1 sine-gordon lagrangian, found numerically
in earlier work [2], are not breathers. these pseudo-breather states do have a sig-
nature in our method, which we suggest can be used to nd similar quasi-bound state
congurations in other theories. we also discuss the results of our algorithm when
applied to the 1+1 sine-gordon model (which exhibits a well-known set of breathers),
and 4 theory.

1 introduction

the leading order chiral lagrangian description of pions, when evaluated on an isospin-
polarized eld conguration, is identical to the 3+1 sine-gordon lagrangian

l =

1
2

  + f 2

 m2 cos(/f) .

(1)

the motivation for considering isospin-polarization of pion elds arises from the possibility
of producing disoriented chiral condensate (dcc) [1] congurations in heavy ion collisions.
in previous work [2], we discussed the numerical properties of a pair of spherically symmetric,
long lived classical solutions which arise from this lagrangian (related studies appear in [3]
and [4]). the evolution of the two congurations is nearly periodic, with energy localized
for hundreds of oscillation cycles. the properties of the lower energy solution are such that
both the quantum corrections and higher derivative terms of the chiral lagrangian should
be negligible. hence it is likely to correspond to a real physical pion conguration in qcd
(pionic breather state, or pbs), which could in principle be produced in heavy ion collisions.
although many of its physical properties have been studied in [2], some theoretical questions
remained unanswered, such as whether truly periodic, nite energy solution might exist in
the 3+1 sine-gordon model.

in this paper we show that the two pbs solutions do not correspond to true breather
solutions, where a breather is dened to be a periodic, nite energy classical solution. our
method can be summarized as follows. first, periodic solutions (r, t) are classied in the
large r region based on their asymptotic behavior, in terms of a nite number of parameters.
then a numerical algorithm is used to evolve the conguration using the equations of motion
from large r to r  0. most choices of asymptotic behavior lead to singular behavior at
r = 0, and hence do not correspond to nite energy solutions. using the criteria of nite
energy, we can search the parameter space in a systematic manner. in section 2, we review
the numerical properties of the two pbs solutions.
in section 3, we give an overview of
our algorithm. in section 3.1, we analyze the free klein-gordon equation and its full set of
periodic solutions. in section 3.2, we use the solutions of section 3.1 as asymptotic forms for
the full sine-gordon theory to search for breather solutions, and present the results. section
4 contains a proof that interactions do not enlarge the set of asymptotic solutions beyond
those of the free klein-gordon equation. that is, there is a one-to-one mapping between
asymptotic behaviors of the free and interacting equations of motion. in section 5 we analyze
the 1+1 sine-gordon and 4 theories, nding that the former theory contains exact breather
solutions while the latter does not. in section 6 we oer concluding remarks.

figures 1 and 2 show the numerically generated evolution of the two breather candidates,

continues virtually unchanged for hundreds of cycles but eventually breaks apart, dissipating
energy to radial innity.

the frequency and approximate lifetime of the lower energy pbs are 0.1 cycles/(fm/c)
and 850fm/c. for the higher energy pbs, they are 0.0619 cycles/(fm/c) and 4000fm/c.

3 the algorithm

for nite energy solutions,   0 as r   1. as   0, nonlinearities in the equation of
motion become negligible, hence the r   behavior of any breather solution must approach
a periodic solution to the noninteracting klein-gordon theory.

the strategy of the following algorithm is as follows. first, we solve for the most general
periodic, nite energy solutions of the klein-gordon equation. these solutions are used as
large r asymptotic forms and are evolved inward to the origin using the full sine-gordon
equation of motion. only solutions which are nite and dierentiable at the origin can
correspond to true breather states. since the space of asymptotic forms is parameterized by
a nite number of variables, a comprehensive search can be initiated which in the end can
rule out the existence of breathers within a certain frequency range.

1sine-gordon nite energy solutions could converge to any multiple of 2, but these solutions are equiv-

alent by a translation in -space to those with   0.

4

3.1 asymptotic forms

it can be shown that the most general periodic, spherically symmetric classical solutions to
the free klein-gordon equation are linear combinations of

(r, t) =

1
r

sin(kr  k) sin(t  ) ,

where

w2 = k2 + m2 .

(4)

(5)

if m = 0, these solutions have innite energy for all , and no breathers exist. for nonzero
m, the set of solutions for 0 <  < m have imaginary k, corresponding to the nite energy
solutions of the form 2

(6)

(7)

(r, t) =

where

1
r

exp(kr) sin(t  ) ,

2 + k2 = m2 .

(since these are the only types of solutions we are interested in, we will drop the tilde from
now on). the most general nite energy periodic solution is therefore

 =

1
r

kj real

xj=1

aj exp(kjr) sin(jf t  j) ,

(8)

where f is the fundamental frequency in the fourier series, and kj = qm2  (j)2. note
that in the case that 0.5m < f < m, this sum has only one term

 =

1
r

a1 exp(k1r) sin(f t) ,

(9)

hence the full set of solutions is parameterized by two variables, a1 and f . the frequencies
of the two numerical pbs solutions fall well within this frequency range.

in the remainder of this section we will work in units with m = 1.

3.2 the search for breathers

using the asymptotic form in equation 9 as r   boundary conditions, the sine-gordon
equations of motion can be integrated inward to r = 0 (see appendix a for computational
details). in general, solutions obtained in this way are neither nite nor dierentiable at

2these are also not breathers, because 

(0, t) 6= 0, and hence there are no true breathers of the free

klein-gordon equation.

the origin, and therefore do not correspond to physical breather states. for small r, the
numerically obtained solutions can be t to the form

and the integral

a(t)

r

+ b(t) ,

s  z 2/f

0

dt |a(t)|

(10)

(11)

can be used as a measure of how singular each solution is at the origin3. a similar measure
of dierentiability could be dened (for instance by tting to a form a(t) r + b(t)), but as
will soon be shown, in the present case not even the singularity condition is fullled, so it is
not necessary.

the size of the singularity s is calculated for various values of a1 and . to ll a1  
space as uniformly as possible values are randomly chosen in the range 0.5 < f < 1 and
a1 > 0. in practice an upper limit on a1 has to be set, so a value is chosen which is much
larger than that of the two known pseudo-breather states. also, the lower limit of a1 had
to be raised slightly (from 0 to 1.2), because a1  0 corresponds to the trivial solution
(r, t) = 0, which lowers the value of s to zero across all values of .

figure 3 shows a plot of s vs. f (the value of a1 is not shown, so the gure can be
thought of as a transparent projection plot). as can be seen, this plot has three prominent
minima. two occur at the frequencies of the previously discovered pbss,   0.560 and
  0.865. neither minima goes all the way to zero, and hence they do not represent exact
breathers. the third minima at  = 1 corresponds to the trivial solution

(r, t) = a sin(mt  ) ,

(12)

with innitesimal a.

as further evidence supporting our hypothesis that these minima correspond to the
previously discovered pbs states, gure 4 shows the shape of a (r, t) calculated near the
minima at   0.560. notice the similarity with gure 2, with the exception of r  0 where
gure 4 becomes singular.

we now dene the solutions corresponding to the minima of the s vs. f curve as
pseudo-breather states (a useful reinterpretation of the acronym pbs, which previously

3although s is obtained by tting to a 1/r form, a nonzero value of s can be shown to also indicate
singularities of the type   1/rn with n > 1. a rst derivative t near the origin would be even more
powerful (capable of tting derivative and logarithmic singularities), but tends to yield ever increasing values
of s as the t is done closer to the origin, which is less manageable. it will therefore be avoided until cases
where it is necessary, such as the 1+1 sine-gordon equation discussed later in this paper.

6

figure 3: the singularity s vs. oscillation frequency f

referred to pionic breather state). although not true breathers, pseudo-breathers can often
exhibit very interesting behavior. as was discussed in [2], the two pbs congurations arise
readily from multi-domain dcc congurations, have characteristic energies and frequencies,
and might extend the lifetime of classical pion congurations by more than an order of
magnitude.

4 a more formal justication

at this point questions still remain about the comprehensive nature of the solutions obtained
in the previous section. it is unclear how the addition of interactions might enlarge the full
set of periodic solutions. perhaps each asymptotic form corresponds to multiple solutions,
and integrating inward only uncovers one.
in this section we reanalyze the equations of
motion by expanding  in a power series. without solving the resulting complicated set of
equations, we study its general nature to answer the question just presented, and therefore
verify that the previously described algorithm is valid.

figure 4: evolution of (r, t) at the   0.560 minima of gure 3

in section 4.1, we work out a general form of the solutions. in section 4.2, we use this
general form to solve the free klein-gordon equations as a test case for the full theory, which
we nish with in section 4.3.

4.1 a series form for the solutions

first we show that the most general periodic solution with frequency 0.5 <  < 1 is of the
form 4

(r, t) = a sin(t)

ekr

r

xj1=2

xj2=2

l =

m22 +  v () ,

we can now write the solution  as a series in ,

(r, t) =



xn=0

nn(r, t) .

,

(13)

(14)

(15)

4in many particular cases such as the sine-gordon or 4 lagrangians, the sum in this general form starts
at j1 = 3 and j2 = 3. this is however a particular case of the form as given, and therefore need not be
considered separately.

8

we will inductively show that each term is of the form of equation 13

substituting 15 into the equations of motion, yields

[2 + m2] n(t, r) = pn[0(r, t), 1(r, t), .... n1(r, t)]

,

(16)

where pn are polynomials expressions related to the klein-gordon interaction term in a
complicated way. the equation for n = 0 is just the klein-gordon equation of motion

[2 + m2] 0(t, r) = 0 ,

hence its solution is the usual one given by equation 9,

this is also the rst term in equation 13.

 = a sin(t)

ekr

r

,

(17)

(18)

iteratively substituting in the expressions for 0, 1, ....n1, we can solve for n.

to show that higher ns are in the form of the remaining term in equation 13, rst
note that since p is polynomial whose lowest order term is at least quadratic, inserting
0, 1, ....n1, yields something of the form

(r, t) =





xj1=2

xj2=2

aj1,j2(t)

ej2kr

rj1

,

(19)

(this diers from equation 13 only in that it is missing the rst term). equation 16 is a
second order linear inhomogeneous dierential equation whose most general solution is

n(r, t) = a sin(t)

ekr

r

+ q(r, t) ,

(20)

where a is an undetermined variable and q(r, t) is any particular solution. it can be shown
that [2 + m2] q spans the space given by equation 19 if q is of the form in equation 13.
a q in the desired form can therefore be chosen to satisfy the dierential equation, and by
equation 20, n is also in this form.

4.2 the klein-gordon case

before we work with the full equation of motion, we will use the form of equation 13 in the
free klein-gordon lagrangian to derive the full solution for a given large r behavior of  (in
the form of equation 9), and show that this is unique. although this result is trivial, it sets
up a formalism which can be naturally extended for the next section when we will repeat
this for the full theory including interactions.

9

substituting the form of equation 13 into the klein-gordon equation of motion yields

the decoupled set of equations

a2,j2(t) + [j 2

2 k2 + m2]a2,j2(t) = 0 ,

a3,j2(t) + [j 2

2 k2 + m2]a3,j2(t) = 4j2ka2,j2(t) ,

(21)

(22)

and then for j1 > 3,

aj1,j2(t) + [j 2

2 k2 + m2]aj1,j2(t) = 2j2k(j1  1)aj11,j2(t) + j1(j1  1)aj12,j2(t) .

(23)

these are each second order linear inhomogeneous dierential equations with general solution

aj1,j2(t) = aj1,j2 sin(j2t  j1,j2) + pj1,j2(t) ,

(24)

where aj1j2 and j1,j2 are undetermined constants, pj1,j2(t) is any particular solution, and

2
j2 + (kj2)2 = m2 .

(25)

note however that each aj1,j2 is forced to be zero. the sin(j2t  j1,j2) is an on-resonance
driving term for the next dierential equation (with j1 incremented by one), and the asso-
ciated solution is not periodic. all freedom in the choice of aj1,j2 is lost. the driving terms
for each dierential equation iteratively become zero and therefore each pj1,j2(t) = 0.

the most general solution with the given lowest order asymptotic term is therefore

 =

1
r

a exp(kr) sin(t) .

(26)

4.3 adding interactions

now we repeat the analysis in the last section for the case where there is an interaction
term present, and arrive at our nal conclusion for this section, that the solution to the full
equation (interaction present) is completely determined by the frequency and size of the rst
order asymptotic piece that is a solution to the free klein-gordon theory.

repeating the same analysis with an interaction term changes equation 21-23 to

a2,j2(t) + [j 2

2 k2 + m2]a2,j2(t) = p1,j2[a1,1, a2,2, ....]

,

a3,j2(t) + [j 2

2 k2 + m2]a3,j2(t) = 4j2ka2,j2(t) + p2,j2[a1,1, a2,2, ....]

,

(27)

(28)

and then for j1 > 3,

aj1,j2(t) + [j 2

2 k2 + m2]aj1,j2(t) = 2j2k(j1  1)aj11,j2(t) + j1(j1  1)aj12,j2(t) + (29)

pj1,j2[a1,1, a2,2, ....]

.

10

the actual form of pj1,j2 is related to the klein-gordon interaction term in a complicated
way, but two things are clear. first, since the interaction contains no linear terms, pj1,j2
is at least quadratic in the aj1,j2s, and can not explicitly cancel the linear terms already
present from equations 21-23. second, each pj1,j2 only contains terms aj1,j2(t) with j1 < j1
and j2 < j2. this allows us to solve iteratively beginning with the lower order solutions,
yielding once again simple second order linear inhomogeneous dierential equations.

unlike in the noninteracting case, after inserting in the lower order solutions aj1,j2(t),
pj1,j2 may have a term in it proportional to the on-resonance driving piece, sin(j2t  j1,j2).
this doesnt add any freedom in our choices of aj1,j2 however, in that now these values must
be chosen to cancel the resonant pieces. this constraint completely species the form of
each aj1,j2(t), hence there is no additional freedom in the choice of solutions.

the nal solution is therefore unique given its lowest order large r asymptotic behavior.

5 other examples

figure 5: s vs.  for the 1+1 sine-gordon lagrangian

we end by applying our method on two other examples, the 1+1 sine-gordon equa-
tion, and 4 theory. the 1+1 sine-gordon lagrangian is a well studied model with known
breathers, and is thus used as a test of our algorithm.

minor modications had to be made to work in 1+1 dimensions. the asymptotic form

11

figure 6: s vs.  for the 3+1 4 theory

in equation 9 was changed to

 = a1 exp(k1r) sin(f t) .

(30)

also, in 1+1 dimensions, (r, t) does not readily become singular at r = 0, hence we tested
the dierentiability of  at zero.

the s vs.  plots for each lagrangian appear in gures 5 and 6.

in the 1+1 sine-
gordon plot the values of s go to zero across all values of , indicating a class of breathers
as expected. the 4 plot stays positive for all values of , hence in 3+1 dimensional 4
theory, there are no breathers in the frequency range 0.5 <  < 1.

6 conclusions

in this paper we have developed a numerical search algorithm for spherically symmetric
breathers in spin zero theories. this algorithm was used to show that breather-like states
found in a previous work were not actual breathers, but rather a new type of object, a
pseudo-breather, which, while long-lived,
is ultimately unstable. we showed that the
asymptotic behavior of periodic solutions which might have nite energy can be parame-
terized in terms of a nite number of parameters. in the case of interest, 0.5m < f < m,
there are only two parameters: frequency f and magnitude a1. an extensive search within

12

the sine-gordon model failed to uncover any values of f , a1 for which the solution is non-
singular at the origin. the results for this model are shown in gure 3.

we have, as of yet, left the region 0 < f < 0.5m unexplored (f > m is automatically
excluded by large r energy considerations). it is straightforward in principal to extend the
algorithm to arbitrarily small . this is done by generalizing the form of the asymptotic
solutions. for instance, in the region 0.25m < f < 0.5m, the asymptotic form becomes

 =

1
r

a1 exp(k1r) sin(f t) +

1
r

a2 exp(k2r) sin(2f t  2) .

(31)

there is a numerical trade-o, in that to cover smaller regions of f the number of parameters
to describe the asymptotic solution increases, eventually to innity as f  0.

the condition of spherical symmetry can be relaxed slightly by adding higher partial

wave terms

again, the number of variables needed to parameterize the space of asymptotic forms in-
creases, thus demanding more computational power for each spherical harmonic added.

although not discussed here, our algorithm can be modied to work with higher spin
theories. the condition of spherical symmetry greatly restricts the asymptotic forms, so in
many cases not much more computational power is needed.

two shortcomings of the analysis in this paper are as follows. first, we can not guarantee
that our upper cuto in a1 hasnt hidden a true breather, and second, it is possible (as often
with a numerical analysis) that some exceptional behavior is concealed in the gaps between
calculated values in the s vs. f graph. due to the large range of points and small spacing in
gure 3, this seems unlikely. however, it prevents the result from being completely rigorous.
