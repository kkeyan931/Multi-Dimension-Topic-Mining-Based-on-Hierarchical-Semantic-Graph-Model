abstract

recently, randall and sundrum proposed a static solution to einsteins equations
in ve spacetime dimensions with two 3-branes located at the xed points of s1/z2
to solve the hierarchy problem. we extend the solution and construct static and also
inationary solutions to einsteins equations in ve spacetime dimensions, one of which
is compactied on s1, with any number of 3-branes whose locations are taken to be
arbitrary. we discuss how the hierarchy problem can be explained in our model.

1. introduction

recently, randall and sundrum 1) proposed a new interesting mechanism
with a single small extra dimension for solving the hierarchy problem between the planck

scale and the weak scale. a key ingredient of this mechanism is that the metric is not
factorizable and that the 4-dimensional metric is multiplied by a warp factor which is a

rapidly changing function of the extra dimension. they explicitly constructed such a solution
to the einstein equations in 5 spacetime dimensions, one of which is compactied on s1/z2,
with two 3-branes located at the xed points of s1/z2. for a solution to exist, it is crucial
to take into account the eect of the branes on the bulk gravitational metric.

in the randall-sundrum model, the number of 3-branes is 2 and the locations are taken
to be the xed points of s1/z2. although this setup is motivated by recent developments in
string and m-theory, 2) it would be of interest to construct new solutions to 5-dimensional
the einstei equations with many 3-branes. in this letter, we explicitly construct solutions

with an arbitrary number of 3-branes which are put at arbitrary positions in the direction
of the extra dimension. our motivation for this is threefold. first, it is known that any

number of parallel d-branes can be put at arbitrary positions and that the gauge dynamics
depend on the distances of multiple d-branes. thus, it is physically meaningful to construct
solutions corresponding to many 3-branes put at arbitrary positions. second, many-brane

congurations could explain other hierarchy problems, such as the fermion mass hierarchy.
the original randall-sundrum model gives a solution to the hierarchy problem between the

planck scale and the weak scale, but it does not solve other hierarchy problems. in recent
works on large extra dimensions, 3) various mechanisms to solve hierarchy problems have
been proposed. some of the authors have pointed out that multiple 3-branes could account
for the fermion mass hierarchy. 4) in this scenario, the mass hierarchy crucially depends on
the distances between 3-branes. thus, again, it is interesting to consider multiple 3-brane
congurations with various distances between 3-branes. third, in any higher-dimensional
model, stabilizing extra dimensions is, in general, hard to achieve. in ref. 5) a mechanism

for stabilizing extra dimensions with multiple branes is proposed.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we construct static solutions to ein-
steins equations in ve spacetime dimensions with any number of 3-branes put at arbitrary

positions. in section 3, we discuss the hierarchical structure of our model. in section 4,
we extend the static solutions found in section 2 to inationary solutions. conclusions are

given in section 5.

in the randall-sundrum model, the orbifold xed points
2. many-brane congurations
of s1/z2 have been taken as the locations of two 3-branes. since we would like to consider
any number of 3-branes whose locations are taken to be arbitrary, we here take a circle s1,

2

rather than s1/z2, as the compactication of an extra dimension. ) the coordinate  for
the extra dimension is taken to extend from 0 to 2 with the identication of (x,  = 0)
with (x,  = 2).

let us consider n parallel 3-brane congurations in 5 spacetime dimensions. the i-th
3-brane may be characterized by the location i and the brane tension vi (i = 1, 2,   , n).
we arrange the locations of the 3-branes such that 0 = 1 < 2 <    < n < 2. we
have here taken the location 1 of the rst 3-brane to be the origin of s1 for convenience.
since the 5-dimensional spacetime is divided into n domains by n 3-branes, each domain

sandwiched between the i-th and the (i + 1)-th 3-branes can have a dierent 5-dimensional
cosmological constant i. ) thus, the action we start with is given by )

we note that every i should be negative for the solution to make sense, as pointed out in
ref. 1). this requirement can, however, be relaxed for inating solutions, as we see below.

the second equation (5) requires that the 5-dimensional cosmological constants and the
brane tensions be related as

with 0  n . )

although we have given the exact analytical expression for (), it may be instructive
to determine this geometrically. the solution (6) turns out to be depicted as follows: first,
specify distinct n points i which correspond to the locations of n 3-branes and choose
the values of (i) at  = i appropriately. the entire -dependence of () can then be
obtained by connecting two adjacent points (i) and (i+1) for i = 1, 2,   , n by straight
lines. in general, each line will be bent at  = i. the slope of the line in the region of
i   < i+1 corresponds to i, which is related to i through eq. (8). the dierence
between the slopes of the adjacent lines at  = i is proportional to the brane tension

) to obtain the relation for i = 1, we need to use the periodicity of ().

vi. although the solution () can completely be specied by 2n parameters i and (i)
(i = 1, 2,   , n), two of them are not physically relevant. an additive constant to () can
be absorbed into an overall constant rescaling of x, and an overall shift of i has no physical
consequence.

3. hierarchical structure

here we discuss the hierarchical structure of the solution derived
in the previous section. to this end, the mass scale of all the parameters (i, vi, m and rc)
in the fundamental theory is assumed to be on the order of the planck scale.

as mentioned in the previous section, () is specied by i and (i). without loss of
generality, we can assume that (i)  (1) = 0. as was done in ref. 1), we can derive the
4-dimensional eective theory by performing the  integral. it turns out that the square of
the planck mass on every 3-brane has the same value, i.e.

m 2

pl = m 3rcz 2

(0.10)

this relation is consistent with the assumption that m and rc are on the order of the planck
scale if the i are on the order of 1 and (i)  1 for i = 2, 3,   , n.

now, the hierarchical structure of our model is obvious. although the 4-dimensional
(eective) newton constant is observed to be order m 2
for every brane, the physical mass
pl
scales for the i-th brane will reduce by the warp factor e(i) from the fundamental param-
eters not far from the planck scale. the randall-sundrum scenario works well in our model,

but we can obtain a variety of the hierarchy between the planck scale and physical mass
scales, which is not seen in the original randall-sundrum solution. thus, in our model the
hierarchy problem may be explained as follows: the reason why the hierarchy between the

tev scale and the planck scale is observed in our world is merely that we happen to live on
a 3-brane whose warp factor is of order 1015.

4. inating 3-branes

here, we obtain solutions describing inating 3-branes in 5 spacetime

ds2 = a()2(dt2 + v(t)2ijdxidxj) + r2

c d2.

with this form of the metric, the einstein equations (2) reduce to

v(t)

v(t)!2

equation (12) can easily be solved as

v(t) = v(0)eht,

(0.15)

where h corresponds to the expansion rate along a 3-brane after the coecient of dt2 is
normalized to unity on the 3-brane.

although we have not found a simple expression for a(), like eq. (6), solutions to the

above equations turn out to be of the form

a() = iei + iei

for i   < i+1.

(0.16)

requiring that a() be continuous at  = i (i = 1, 2,   , n) leads to )

it may be worth noting that the rst relation (18) does not necessarily imply that i is
negative. solutions may exist even when i > 0.
in this case, i is purely imaginary,
and the exponential functions in eq. (16) should be replaced by trigonometric functions.
furthermore, even if h 2 is negative, we would obtain physically meaningful solutions by
analytic continuation . 9) the last equation (14) can be satised provided

where 0  n , 0  n and 0  n .

) the continuity condition at  = 1 = 0 implies that a(2) = a(0).

the above solutions for n = 1 and 2 (one and two 3-branes) are investigated in refs. 8)
and 9). it, however, seems dicult to analyze the solutions for general n thoroughly. we

will not proceed further in this paper. some of the physical implications of our solutions
may be found in refs. 8) and 9).

conclusion

in this paper, we have found new solutions to the einstein equations in 5
spacetime dimensions with many 3-branes. the original randall-sundrum solution contains
only two 3-branes whose locations are xed at the orbifold xed points of s1/z2, and is
static. in our model, any number of parallel 3-branes can be put at arbitrary locations in
the direction of the 5th dimension, and the brane tensions and the cosmological constants of

the 5-dimensional bulks sandwiched between the 3-branes can, in general, be taken to have
dierent values, though they must satisfy some ne tuning relations for solutions to exist. we

have further succeeded in extending the static solutions to the inationary solutions, though
our analysis is far from complete. as in the randall-sundrum model, our model can give
a solution to the hierarchy problem between the planck scale and the tev scale. although

the randall-sundrum model does not answer other hierarchy problems such as the fermion
mass hierarchy, the existence of multiple 3-branes in our model could oer a mechanism
to solve them. a nal comment is that although the 5th dimension is compactied on s1,
our solutions will persist on a non-compact space. this can be seen by simply ignoring the

periodicity condition.
