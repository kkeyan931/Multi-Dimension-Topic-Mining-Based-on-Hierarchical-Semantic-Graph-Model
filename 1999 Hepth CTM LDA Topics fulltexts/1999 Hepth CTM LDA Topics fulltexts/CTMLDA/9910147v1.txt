one-loop regularization of supergravity ii: the

dilaton and the superfield formulation

abstract

the on-shell regularization of the one-loop divergences of supergravity theories is
generalized to include a dilaton of the type occurring in eective eld theories de-
rived from superstring theory, and the supereld structure of the one-loop corrections
is given. field theory anomalies and quantum contributions to soft supersymmetry
breaking are discussed. the latter are sensitive to the precise choice of couplings
that generate pauli-villars masses, which in turn reect the details of the underlying
theory above the scale of the eective cut-o. with a view to the implementation
the green-schwarz and other mechanisms for canceling eld theory anomalies under a
u (1) gauge transformation and under the t-duality group of modular transformations,
we show that the kahler potential renormalization for the untwisted sector of orbifold
compactication can be made invariant under these groups.

1 introduction

it has been shown [1][3], that pauli-villars (pv) regularization of one-loop ultraviolet
divergences is possible for an n = 1 supergravity theory if yang-mills elds have canonical
kinetic energy. in this paper those results are generalized to include their couplings to a
dilaton. in section 2 we summarize earlier results, and display the logarithmically divergent
one-loop corrections in the form of supereld operators, which permits the extension of
those results to fermionic terms [4, 5] in the one-loop corrected eective lagrangian. this
formulation will also be convenient for the subsequent analysis.
in section 3 the dilaton
is incorporated in the pauli-villars regularization of anomaly-free supergravity described
in ref. [3], hereafter referred to as i. the application of pv regularization to determine
soft supersymmetry breaking terms is also discussed in this section. it is shown that the
contributions to a-terms are highly sensitive to the details of the regularization. in section
4 we regulate eective theories of orbifold compactication with twisted sector elds set
to zero in the background. we show that this regularization can be done in such a way
that the renormalization of the kahler potential is invariant under modular (t-duality)
transformations; we have in mind the construction of an eective one-loop lagrangian that is
perturbatively modular invariant. in section 5 the discussion of regularization and anomalies
is extended to theories with an anomalous u(1) gauge symmetry. the results are summarized
in section 6, where we discuss issues still to be addressed in order to achieve full anomaly
cancellation. many calculational details are relegated to the appendixes.

2 preliminaries

in this paper we consider supergravity theories dened by the standard lagrangian [6, 7]
with n chiral multiplets z i = 1, ...n 1, s, where s is a gauge singlet, and ng gauge
supermultiplets. the kahler potential k, superpotential w and gauge kinetic function f
are given by

k(z, z) =  ln(s + s) + g(, ) = k + g, w (z) = w (),
fab(z) = abs = ab(x + iy),

(2.1)

which are the classical functions found in string compactications with ane level one.1 in
this section we briey recall the results of [1, 3], and cast them in a supereld form that will
allow us to short-cut some of the subsequent calculations.

2.1 one-loop logarithmic divergences in supergravity

the ultra-violet divergent part of the one-loop corrected supergravity lagrangian for bosons
was calculated in [8]-[10]. the result for the logarithmically divergent contribution is

where l(g, k) is the standard lagrangian [6, 7] for n = 1 supergravity coupled to matter
with space-time metric g, kahler potential k and superpotential w . v = v + d is
the classical scalar potential with v = ekai ai  3m 2, ai = dia, d = (2x)1dada,
da = ki(taz)i, m 2 = eka a is the eld-dependent squared gravitino mass, and di is the
scalar eld reparameterization covariant derivative. scalar indices are lowered and raised
with the kahler metric ki m and its inverse k i m.

the operators la in (2.2) are given in component form2 in eqs. (2.2527) of i,

 the yang-mills eld strength. as in i we have dropped total derivatives (except for
the gauss-bonnet term) and other terms that do not contribute to the s-matrix, by virtue
of the classical equations of motion of the physical elds.

it will be convenient here to display these operators in supereld form. -integration of
the supereld operators gives expressions that include the various auxiliary elds. replacing
these by the solutions of their classical equations of motion gives the component expressions,
up to terms that do not contribute to the s-matrix. we will display here the component
expressions only for those operators that are not included in i. the component expressions
for operators constructed from tensor-valued functions t (z, z) are given in appendix a.

rial derivatives d{w}(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) are elements of the riemann tensor), and the superelds

the last term in 0 is equivalent to a renormalization of the kahler potential; up to a eld-

as shown in appendix a, l can be obtained as a linear combination of l and an operator
generated by a metric eld redenition that eliminates terms quadratic in the space-time
scalar curvature and the ricci tensor. that is, it is equivalent to a linear combination of
l and a d-term (2.13) constructed from the superelds that determine the elements of
the super-riemann and torsion tensors [7]: a = r r, gaga, . . .. in addition we have the

butions from negative signature pv chiral superelds z i with the same gauge charges and
kahler metric as the matter elds.

(2.20)

cancellation of this term and of the logarithmic divergence in the renormalization of the
kahler potential in (2.2) require pv chiral superelds z i with nonvanishing kij , and with
superpotential couplings to the light chiral multiplets. the part of kr that depends on
the gauge couplings of the light elds is canceled by superpotential couplings of the pv
elds a to the z i and to pv chiral elds yi that transform according to the gauge group
representation that is conjugate to the light matter representation. these couplings are given
explicitly in section 3, slightly modied with respect to those adopted in i, as required by
the presence of the dilaton. the supereld form of the operator l

this term and the remaining contributions to l0,,g are canceled by the introduction of

a nontrivial gauge kinetic function, as described in i. the supereld structure of l
g is less
transparent. it is equivalent up to terms that vanish on shell to linear combinations of the

the generic operators introduced above and d-terms that involve supergravity superelds:
 = g kssdsd  s, . . .. as shown in appendix c, this term must be exactly canceled by
pv abelian gauge multiplets that couple to the dilaton.

2.2 pv regularization with a dilaton

the ultraviolet divergent one-loop corrections to supergravity were calculated [8][10] in the
presence of a nontrivial gauge kinetic function of the form:

fab(z) = abf (z)ka,

f (z) = x + iy 6= constant.

(2.22)

in [1] it was shown that the dilaton-induced quadratically divergent contribution, given by
[t is dened as in (2.8)]

strh  

2ngfi f m

(f + f )2 (cid:16) aia m + dzidz m(cid:17) = ng dt| , ti = di ln(f + f ),

(2.23)

can be regulated by the introduction of ng additional pauli-villars chiral multiplets  with

k(, ) =x

(f + f)||2, w () =x

()2,



 = +1.

(2.24)

the expression for the logarthmically divergent loop corrections [10] with an arbitrary holo-
morphic function f (z) is very complicated. here we consider the much simpler case of the
string dilaton, with the dilaton couplings dened by (2.1). for this model (2.23) takes the
form

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.27)

strh  2ng m 2 +

ss

4x2 ! = ng dk| ,

and the gravitino mass is equal to the gaugino mass:

m 2

 = m 2

 = m 2 = ekas as.

in addition we have

f + f = ek(s, s) = ek,

so instead of introducing the additional pv elds in (2.24), we need only modify the kahler
potential for the gauge elds c used in [1, 3] to regulate gravity loops:

k(c, c) =xc

ec k+ck|c|2,

7

(2.28)

where the case of canonical gauge kinetic energy, f (z) = 1, is recovered for c = 0.

a term proportional to (2.25) is also generated if abelian gauge pv superelds couple
to the dilaton. we nd that it is this latter mechanism that must be used in order to cancel
the dilaton-dependent logarithmic divergences that arise from gauge loops. we will also
need to introduce chiral pv multiplets with a kahler potential of the form (2.28), with the
constraints (see appendix c)

xc

cc =xc

ccc = 0.

(2.29)

3 anomaly-free supergravity

here we assume that there are no gauge or mixed gauge-gravitational anomalies: trt a =
tr({ta, tb}tc) = 0, where ta is a generator of the gauge group. this section closely follows
i, and the reader is referred to that paper for the contributions that are unchanged when
the dilaton is included.

we introduce pauli-villars chiral supermultiplets z i

 = ez i

, bz, that transform under the

, and y 

i = ey 

i , by 

a transform according to the representation ra

gauge group like z i
i , that transform according to the conjugate represen-
tation, as well as gauge singlets y 0, z 0, and chiral multiplets a
, that transform
according to the adjoint representation of the gauge group. additional charged elds x a

and u 
a and its conjugate, respectively, under
the gauge group factor ga, and v a
transforms according to a (pseudo)real representation
that is traceless and anomaly-free. their gauge couplings satisfy

a =xi

which may imply a constraint on the matter representations of the gauge group in the light
spectrum, as discussed in i. in addition, we introduce gauge singlets , as well as u(1)
, s
gauge supermultiplets w = w 0
, respectively, that form massive
vector supermultiplets with chiral multiplets z 0,s
 of the same signature and u(1)

3.3 soft supersymmetry breaking terms

pauli-villars regularization can be used to calculate one-loop contributions to soft supersym-
metry breaking. the calculation of gaugino masses has been given in [11] for string-derived
supergravity with the dilaton in a linear supermultiplet, and including a green-schwarz
(gs) term. these include the anomaly mediated contribution [12, 13] as well as addi-
tional model-dependent contributions. a general analysis of soft supersymmetry breaking
terms in this class of models will be given elsewhere [14]. as an example, we calculate here
the one-loop induced a-term for supergravity theories with matter in chiral supermultiplets.
to obtain this contribution we take constant background elds, and the eective one-loop
potential is given simply by

with the pv mass term removed:

6 rstrh in the integrand; in the constant background eld approxi-
mation r  v after a weyl transformation. assuming < v >= 0, terms proportional to
v can at most contribute small corrections to soft terms already present at tree level. the
second equality in eq. (3.21) is schematic: [h, m2] 6= 0 in general.
soft terms are generated by the pv elds a = ez i, byi, a that govern the wave function
 = ey i, bz i, a, respectively, the elds to which to which they couple in w1:

the rst two terms in eq.
(3.21) are the shift in the potential due to the shift k
in the kahler potential. the rst term, proportional to m2, corresponds [1] to k =
pp cp m2
p , cp = constant. they contribute a-terms and scalar masses proportional to those
already contained in the tree potential, with coecients suppressed by the factor 1/322
(m2  1 in reduced planck units), and we neglect them.

note that the term linear in  in ai can arise from a quadratic term in the superpotential or
in the kahler potential; the relation between the corresponding supermultiplet mass and the
one-loop induced b-term is the same in both cases. if m2
ij = 2 and one assumes canonical
kinetic energy for both the light elds and the pv elds, la reduces to the anomaly
mediated term found in [13]. the contributions that depend explicitly on the pv masses are
contained in the component eld expression of the supereld operator (2.16) that determines
ij/2) is not
the renormalization of the kahler potential. the term proportional to ln(m2
negligible if the scale of supersymmetry breaking is signicantly below the planck scale. a
further model dependence is in the  mlnfij terms.

16

in contrast to the case of gaugino masses studied in [11], the one-loop corrections to the
soft terms in the scalar potential are sensitive to the details of the pauli-villars regularization.
in the gaugino mass case, the pv squared mass matrix commutes with relevant (gauge
supereld dependent) matrix elements. the regulator masses appear only through the ln m2
term, averaged over all charged pv elds, and only the eld dependent part fp (z) of m2
p =
fp (z)2
p contributes to gaugino masses. the eld dependence (i.e., the dependence on elds
that do not vanish in the vacuum, such as the dilaton and moduli) on this average ln m2
is completely xed in terms of the eld-dependence of the light eld kahler metrics. both
the requirements of niteness discussed in section 3 above and the supersymmetry of the
kahler anomaly [16] uniquely determine the eld dependence of ln m2 once the tree-level
theory (including possible couplings of charged matter to a gs term) is specied. however,
only a subset of charged pv elds contribute to the renormalization of the kahler potential.
while the kahler metrics of the elds a that appear in w2 is determined by the niteness
requirement, the metrics of the elds  to which they couple in w1 is arbitrary. since
the associated kahler anomaly is a d-term, it is supersymmetric by itself and there is
no constraint analogous to the conformal/chiral anomaly matching in the case of gauge
eld renormalization with an f-term anomaly. as a consequence the non-universal terms
appearing in l1
sof t cannot be determined precisely in the absence of a detailed theory of
planck scale physics. in the following sections we give examples in which the pv masses
that contribute to l1

sof t are eld independent.

4 string-derived supergravity and t-duality

eective eld theories from superstring compactications are perturbatively invari-
ant [17] under an sl(2, z) group (t-duality) of transformations on the chiral superelds
z  z (z), which is a subgroup of a continuous sl(2, r) group, itself a symmetry of the
classical lagrangian. here we will refer to both groups as modular transformations. they
eect a kahler transformation:

k(z, z)  k(z , z ) = k (z, z) = k(z, z) + f (z) + f ( z),
w (z)  w (z ) = w (z) = ef (z)w (z),

(4.1)

17

and therefore leave the classical lagrangian invariant. because (4.1) includes phase trans-
formations on chiral fermions, the symmetry is anomalous at the quantum level. ungauged
nonlinear -models were considered in i, where it was shown that, while the pv kahler
potential can be chosen to be invariant under (4.1), regularization of the theory with invari-
ant pv masses requires constraints on the light spectrum. moreover, for gauged -models,
invariant regularization does not appear to be possible for any choice of spectrum. indeed, in
supergravity theories obtained from orbifold compactications of string theory, the (weighted
average) masses of gauge nonsinglet pv chiral multiplets are xed [16] by matching eld the-
ory and string theory loop corrections to the moduli-yang-mills couplings, and cannot all
be invariant under t-duality transformations.

specically, we consider a class of orbifold compactications with, in addition to the
dilaton, the chiral superelds z p = t i, p, where t i, i = 1, 2, 3, are the untwisted moduli,
and the kahler potential

as is well known [18][20], [16], invariance under (4.3) is restored by the gs mechanism; the

read

so that the variation of l1, and of model-dependent threshold corrections, are canceled by a
variation in the tree-level coupling of the dilaton to the yang-mills elds. the contribution
in (4.8) satises the string matching condition [16] when the green-schwarz term and the
string-loop threshold corrections are included. threshold corrections [18, 21] can be included
as moduli-dependent terms in the pv superpotential w1 : p = p (t i).

in order to achieve full perturbative modular invariance, we must investigate more com-
pletely the anomaly structure of the one-loop corrected eective theory, including gauge
nonsinglet background elds. supersymmetry relates conformal anomalies, associated with
logarithmic divergences, to chiral anomalies that arise from linearly divergent integrals in

9the kahler potential k no longer satises ij = ai = 0, in the notation of [10], resulting in additional
contributions to the loop corrections. however the modication of k is of one-loop order, and hence the
corresponding one-loop corrections are of two-loop order, which we do not consider here.

19

quantum corrections to the low energy eective theory. when the theory is regulated in
such a way that all integrals are nite, there are strictly speaking no anomalies, but a corre-
sponding noninvariance of the quantum corrected theory results from the noninvariance of
the regulator masses. for example, only light quark loops contribute to the chiral anomaly
that permits neutral pion decay; the anomaly from heavy quark loops is exactly canceled by
the explicit chiral symmetry breaking due to the quark mass term. the contribution of a
pv quark with negative signature has the opposite sign; its anomaly cancels the light quark
anomaly and one is left with the explicit breaking term that exactly reproduces the light
quark anomaly.

provided we can dene modular transformations on the pv elds such that kp v is
invariant and w2 is covariant (w  ef w ), the noninvariance of the regulated one-loop
lagrangian will arise solely from the noncovariance of w1 which governs the pv mass-
matrix mp v . the kahler potential for the  in (3.3) is modular invariant provided the
chiral superelds 
 =  under (4.1). in addition, if we take for the a mass term in (3.4)

w1(a) =x,a(cid:20)

a

(cid:21) ,

(4.10)

the superpotential for chiral elds a with dilaton-like couplings is modular covariant. then
the one loop action can be written as

l1 = linv + l, l =

i
2

str lnhd2 + h(mp v )i

+ t(mp v ),

(4.11)

where linv is modular invariant and l contains only chiral supermultiplet loop contribu-
tions. as a result the masses and covariant derivatives appearing in the noninvariant contri-
bution contain no dirac matrices except in the spin connection, and their contributions are
straightforward to evaluate.

as shown in i, under a transformation on the pv elds that leaves the tree lagrangian

and the pv kahler potential invariant, with w2 covariant:

 = g, m 

p v () = mp v ()

(4.12)

because all the operators in the determinants except mp v are covariant. therefore the

l = linv + l(fmp v ), fmp v = g1m 

p v g,

20

anomalous shift in the lagrangian is given simply by

l1 = l(fmp v )  l(mp v ).

(4.13)

as discussed in i, the quadratically divergent terms may be made invariant by constraints on
the pv mass parameters. in this paper we consider only anomalies arising from logarithmic
divergences and the associated chiral anomalies. as a rst step toward the construction of
a modular invariant one-loop eective lagrangian, we give examples below of regularization
prescriptions with modular covariant pv couplings except in the pv mass terms. in addition
we choose the mass terms such that the renormalization of the kahler potential is modular
invariant.

4.1 no-scale supergravity

first we consider a toy superstring-inspired model [22] with a single modulus t ; the kahler
potential and superpotential given by

k = k + g, g = 3 lnt + t 

the modular transformations are dened by

therefore, since in addition kss = e2k, the contribution of elds with metric ki m can be

canceled by an appropriate combination of by , ez, , provided some  are gauge-charged.

as a consequence of the above, the ultraviolet divergences are still canceled if we modify

including the twisted sector

the kahler potential for orbifolds is not known beyond leading (quadratic) order in the elds
z a 6= s, t , except for the untwisted sector, whose kahler potential (4.41) is determined by
the metric on the compact space. as a consequence, we cannot determine the one-loop
eective action for the twisted sector, but we can include twisted sector loop contributions
to the untwisted sector action, provided the superpotential contains no terms quadratic in
the twisted sector elds. the general modular invariant superpotential11

depends on the moduli through the dedekind -function, interpreted as arising from string
world-sheet instanton eects. in the absence of these eects, which we neglect here, there is
no superpotential for twisted sector elds. we will set background twisted sector elds to
zero, and include only quantum corrections due to the (modular invariant) quadratic term

then the variation in (4.57) is cancelled by the variation in the classical yang-mills la-

5 anomalous u (1)

the modications needed for regulating one-loop supergravity in the presence of an
anomalous u(1) gauge group gx are described in detail in i. the light matter loops generate
a quadratically divergent term proportional to 2x1dxtrtx and logarithmic divergences
proportional to trtx associated with the operators 1,2 in (2.17). to regulate these terms
we must introduce pv chiral multiplets p with superpotential terms that are not invariant
under u(1)x. as discussed in i, in order for the superpotential to remain holomorphic under
a u(1)x gauge transformation, we require the transformation properties

while the light elds are dened to be covariantly chiral [7] under u(1)x, the u(1)x-charged

for a set of values  = 0 withp 0 = 1. u(1)x gauge invariance of kp v and w2

as dened in eq. (3.4) requires a0 = g0. we must also remove by 0

with  6= 0 and net positive signature from the second term in w2, eq. (3.4). with this
choice the linear divergences associated with the u(1)x anomaly are canceled. the chiral
anomaly reappears due to the noninvariance of the mass terms coupling the by 0 to elds

in this case we cannot impose the condition that the kahler metric commutes with the

the u(1)x generator does commute with the kahler metric for pv elds with pv masses
that are not u(1)x covariant. for the untwisted sector of the orbifold model of sections

6 summary of results

we have shown that it is possible to regulate supergravity at one loop by introduc-
ing pauli-villars elds in chiral multiplets and abelian gauge multiplets. for calculational
simplicity, we restricted the dilaton couplings to those of the classical limit of supergravity
derived from the heterotic string, but there is no impediment in principle to extending our
results to the more general case. in the context of string theory, this generalization is re-
quired, for example, when nonperturbative string eects and/or gs terms are included in
the eective tree lagrangian. it would also be useful to know the full one-loop correc-
tions in the linear multiplet formulation. however, certain one loop-eects such as the soft
supersymmetry breaking terms and the anomalous contributions to the yang-mills kinetic
term, depend only on gauged-charged matter and yang-mills loops. in this case, with the
dilaton appearing only as a background eld, it is fairly straightforward [11, 14] to include
the above-mentioned terms, and to generalize the results to the linear multiplet formulation
for the dilaton. the a-terms for general supergravity without a gs term were calculated

31

in section 3, and were found to be very sensitive to the details of the precise choice of the
pauli-villars couplings, which in turn can be determined only with a detailed understanding
of planck-scale physics.

string-derived supergravity is anomalous at the quantum level under perturbatively exact
symmetries such as t-duality and u(1)x of the underlying string theory. when appropri-
ate green-schwarz terms are included, the eective eld theory should be invariant, up to
nonperturbative string eects, at the quantum level. one could, for example, make the regu-
lated tree lagrangian fully modular invariant by including appropriate factors of the modular
covariant dedekind function (it ) in the pv mass term w1. these would be interpreted
as threshold corrections from heavy string and kaluza-klein modes. however, string-loop
calculations show that at least a part of the modular anomaly is canceled by a gs term; in
particular, for orbifolds like z3 and z7 with no n = 2 supersymmetric twisted sector, there
are no (modular noninvariant) threshold corrections [24] to the gauge kinetic term: bi
a = 0 in
(4.58). moreover, cancellation of the u(1)x anomaly other than by a gs mechanism seems
problematic.

a part of the conformal anomaly can be directly inferred by replacing ln 2 in (2.2) by
the real supereld ln m 2(z i, z m), where the lowest component m 2(zi, z m) = m 2(z i, z m)|
is the pv squared mass matrix. under a transformation that leaves the regulated tree
lagrangian invariant except for the pv mass terms, the shift in (2.2) is determined by [see

(4.12)] m 2(z i, z m)  fm 2(z i, z m) = eh(z)+ h( z)m 2(z i, z m), where h(z) is a holomorphic

function of the chiral elds. the supersymmetric anomalies associated with the f-term
operators given in section 2 are also f-terms which contain the associated chiral anomalies;
the general form of these operators is given in appendix 2.
it has been conjectured [19]
that all of these anomalies might be canceled entirely or in part, depending on the string
threshold corrections in specic models, by the gs term included in (4.9). this would
require a tree-level coupling of the dilaton to the chiral superelds w ,  in (2.10), for
example, inducing additional operators (and potential anomalies) at the one-loop level. the
d-term operators of section 2 give rise to d-term anomalies, also displayed in appendix
a. in principle these could also be canceled by a tree-level coupling of the dilaton to real
superelds such as those in (2.14) via a d-term of the form (2.13), again implying additional
operators at one loop. one such d-term is the shift in the kahler potential, (2.16). we have

32

shown that the regularization of this term can be made free of modular and u(1)x anomalies
for supergravity from orbifold compactication with background twisted sector elds set to
zero. it is not clear that this can be achieved with twisted sector elds in the background.
the full set of anomalous operators contains additional terms that arise due to the fact

that the pv masses are not constant; dfm 6= 0. determining these requires keeping higher

order terms in the derivative expansion (as in the calculation of soft terms in section 3.3)
and retaining total derivatives (like the gauss-bonnet term) in the coecient of ln 2. in
addition it is necessary to verify the cancellation of linear divergences  or equivalently13 to
show that (4.12) is satised by comparing that expression with with the anomaly calculated
from l()  l(). these issues will be addressed elsewhere.

a. component expressions of general superelds operators

after eliminating the auxiliary elds using their tree-level equations of motion [7]:

f i = ek/2 ai,

2r| = ek/2a, xda = da,

(a.1)

we obtain for the bosonic terms for the supereld operators introduced in section 2.1:

dt| = t0 + (mn) tmn,

t0 =

1
2 dt| , tmn = 

m

nt,

13however this procedure applied to modular and u (1)x anomalies will not insure, for example, the

correct dilaton dependence of the kahler metric.

in the fully regulated lagrangian, ln 2 in (2.2) is replaced by the real supereld ln m 2(z i, z m),
where the lowest component m 2(zi, z m) = m 2(z i, z m)| is the pv squared mass matrix. un-
der a transformation that leaves the regulated tree lagrangian invariant except for the pv
mass terms: m 2(z i, z m)  eh(z)+ h( z)m 2(z i, z m), where h(z) is a holomorphic function
of the chiral elds, the full anomaly associated with the one-loop generated f-term operators
given in section 2 can be expressed in term of supersymmetric eld operators of the form

the chiral anomalies in the above expressions arise from the standard nonlocal operators
generated by fermion loops. for the d-terms operators of section 2, the corresponding
anomalies are also d-terms:

l(, h) =z d4eh + h.c..

(a.14)

in addition there are contributions from terms involving derivatives of the pauli-villars
masses that do not grow with the cut-o and were not included in section 2.

b. modications of the z i, yi contributions

the elds ez i

 play the same role as z i

1 in i. however, if we were to use the kahler potentials
k z, k y adopted in i, we would have for the covariant derivatives of the gauge kinetic function
f (z) = s:

fez
ij = didj f = k
which would generate unwanted contributions from ez i
terms in kez is to eliminate these contributions; their presence in turn requires compensating
modications of key and kby . in this appendix we calculate the modications with respect

ij fk 6= 0,

(b.6)

(b.7)

(b.8)

the eect of the fi-dependent terms in kez is to eliminate the contributions to kij with
ij = ls, sl, l 6= s (note that kss = kss = kss = 0). since

kij k ij =  kij k ij,

(b.9)

we simply need to subtract the terms quadratic in kij in products of kij and its derivatives.
we have

kij = kjki + kjki  2kikj,

i kj + k

(b.10)

kij = kikj, djki = kikj,

kiai = a,

we obtain

then from the expression for l3 given by eqs. (2.13), (2.20), (a.10) and (a.11) [or explicitly

with additional contributions that require a modication of the constraints on the parameters
, , , as in section 4.1, with n  3 n in (4.35). when an anomalous u(1) is present we
require that some c carry u(1) charge so as to cancel the last term in (d.4), as described
in section 5.2.

here we list additional corrections to [10] that involve dilaton couplings, and were not re-
ported in i.

1. the second line of the rhs of the expression (c.48) for try 2 should read
