we put forward an example of local, covariant lagrangians where the feynman rules result in
diagrams of qed but with regularized propagators. following t hooft and veltman, these diagrams
may be taken to dene a quantum eld theory of electrodynamic phenomena that requires no
regularization and is realistic, because: (i) the corresponding greens functions are causal. (ii) its
s-matrix is unitary. (iii) the theory does not imply the existence of particles with wrong metric
and/or wrong statistics. (iv) it contains the experimental predictions of qed. no such lagrangians
were known before.

i. introduction

when calculating greens functions and s-matrix elements of qed by perturbation expansion, one has to modify
(regularize) certain divergent integrals to obtain nite results for feynman diagrams containing loops. such regu-
larizations are understood as formalistic technical devices, devoid of any direct physical meaning, that lead upon
renormalization to identical, acceptable results. so far no realistic regularization scheme is known that is an inte-
gral part of a realistic, physical model of quantum electrodynamic phenomena. which presents a serious conceptual
problem we will propose a solution to [1].

quantitative predictions about quantum-electrodynamic phenomena implied by the lagrangian of qed are com-
puted using the feynman rules, a regularization scheme, and renormalization. were there a local and covariant
lagrangian where the feynman rules result in the diagrams of qed but with regularized propagators, we could follow
t hooft and veltman [2] and use these feynman diagrams to dene a quantum eld theory of electrodynamic phenom-
ena that requires no regularization, provided its greens functions are causal, and the s-matrix is unitary and contains
the experimental predictions of qed. now, there are variants of the pauli-villars regularization of qed (where in all
diagrams one adds to photon and electron propagators suitable sums of four-vector and bispinor propagators, t hooft
and veltman [2] call unitary regulators) that can be derived from such lagrangians. however, these lagrangians are
not realistic since they imply the existence of heavy particles with wrong metric and/or wrong statistics. it is the
purpose of this paper to present for qed an example of realistic, local and covariant lagrangians that generalize the
method of unitary regulators [2] so that no unphysical particles are implied. as far as we know, these lagrangians
[3] provide, for the rst time since the foundation of qed [1], a framework for realistic quantum eld theories of
electrodynamic phenomena in four-dimensional space-time with such propagators that no regularization is required.
as to each additional singularity of a unitarly regularized feynman propagator corresponds an additional particle [2],
we will rst show how one can covariantly regularize the feynman propagators so that they do not acquire additional
singularities and have the kallen-lehman representation used for proving causality and unitarity [2,4]. regarding
metric and other conventions we follow refs. [2,4]; in particular, a four-vector k = (~k, ik0), and k2  ~k  ~k  (k0)2.

ii. covariant regulators without singularities

consider a covariantly regularized spin-0 feynman propagator, say, f (x) whose space-time fourier transform

where: (a) the regulator (z) is an analytic function of complex variable z with a nite discontinuity somewhere
across the negative real axis; (c) |(z + m2)1 + (z)| = o(|z|r), r > 1, as |z|  ; (d) (z) is real for z > 0; (e) (z)
depends on some cuto parameter  so that for any   0 > 0 it has properties (a) to (d), and for   ,

and

using cauchys integral formula we can conclude that the considered covariant regularization of the spin-0 feynman
propagator admits the kallen-lehman representation

so we can decompose the regularized spin-0 propagator f (x) into positive and negative energy parts: f (x) =
(x0)+(x) + (x0)(x) [2]. we can analogously regularize each of the two terms of spin-1/2 and of spin-1
feynman propagators so that they acquire no additional singularities and have the kallen-lehman representation:
in x-space we can decompose so regularized feynman propagators into positive and negative energy parts without
contact terms [2].

function i(2)4(  m2 + )n(k2 + m2  i)1(k2 +   i + )n,  > m2, n = 1, 2, . . ., is an example

of a regularized spin-0 feynman propagator that satises the above conditions with r = n/2 + 1. unfortunately, we
cannot use analogous propagators for a realistic regularization of qed since we do not know how to construct the
corresponding local lagrangian.

in view of relations (4) and (5), we can regard a regulator that is an analytic function of the complex variable k2 with
a nite discontinuity across the negative real axis as a unitary regulator that is a limit of a weighted sum of propagators
of the same kind as their number tends to innity. thus to use such regulators for a realistic regularization of qed,
we have to generalize the method of unitary regulators [2] to an innite number of auxilliary elds by constructing
local, covariant lagrangians whose propagators for interacting elds can be taken as regularized photon and electron
propagators that have no additional singularities.

iii. lagrangian for regularization of propagators in qed

we will consider qed where photons have a very small mass  [2,4]: with the source terms included, its lagrangian

reads

lqed =  1

4 (a  a)2  1

2 2a2  (

  + m) + ie a + aj + je + je ,

(7)

where j(x), je(x), and je(x) are four-vector and bispinor source elds. the feynman propagator for the four-vector
eld a(x) is

and the feynman propagator for the bispinor eld (x) is

 i(2)4  + 2kk
k2 + 2  i

;

 i(2)4 ik + m
k2 + m2  i

.

(8a)

(8b)

it is possible to modify the qed lagrangian (7) so that the propagators for a and  elds are such regularizations
of propagators (8) that have no additional singularities. take, for example, the following real-valued, local lagrangian
[3]:

ltr = l1  l1/2 + ie a + aj + je + je

where (x, p) and

 b  a(b)  (a)b; 1/2  

(x, p) are four-vector-valued functions of two four-vectors x and p; 1/2(x, p) is a bispinor-
1/24; t(p2) and f (p2) are real-valued functions of

real p2, r d4pf 2(p) = 1; and q1, s1, q1/2, s1/2, and  are real parameters. this lagrangian is covariant and its own
lagrangian ltr is a sort of lagrangian dening unitary regulators [2] since it is constructed by modifying lqed in
the following sense: (i) we introduced an innite number of four-vector and bispinor elds of x that have a continuous
index p. (ii) we replaced the free part of lqed with the lagrangian l1  l1/2, which is of the rst order in  and
has a nondiagonal mass matrix. (iii) in the interaction and source terms, we replaced the elds a(x) and (x) in
lqed with weighted integrals (9d) of (x, p) and 1/2(x, p) over the continuous index p.

consistent with (9d) we write

(x, p) = (x, p) + f (p2)a(x) ,

1/2(x, p) = 1/2(x, p) + f (p2)(x) ,

where (x, p) and 1/2(x, p) are such that

z d4pf (p2)(x, p) = 0 ,

z d4pf (p2)1/2(x, p) = 0 ,

(10a)

(10b)

and consider (x, p), a(x), (x, p), 1/2(x, p), and (x) in ltr as independent elds. proceeding as in ref. [3], we
can infer that the feynman propagator for the four-vector eld a(x) in ltr equals

for any 2, m2 and integer n, there are real functions f (p2) and t(p2), and constants s1, s1/2, q1, q1/2, and 0 > 0
2 propagators (8) analogous

such that the propagators (11) and (14) with  > 0 are regularizations of spin-1 and spin- 1
to (1) [5]. in such a case: (i) imn(k2) are real for k2  m2, (ii) the constants s1, s1/2, q1 and q1/2 are such that

e2(2) = 2 ,
eg1/2(2) = 1 + de2(k2 = 2)/dk2 ,

em2(m2) = m2
eg1(m2) = 1 + dem2(k2 = m2)/dk2 .

so propagators (11) and (14) with  = 0 have poles at k2 = 2 and k2 = m2, respectively, and their behaviour at
these poles is given by spin-1 and spin- 1
2 propagators (8) with  = 0. (iii) the dierence between spin-1 propagator
and propagator (11) can be made arbitrarily small for any |k2|  k for all k > 0, if we choose  suciently large; and
the same goes for spin- 1
2 and (14) propagators. so we may consider  as a cut-o constant. (iv) the propagators (11)
and (14) are analytic functions of k2 that (a) are not continuous across the negative real axis, (b) have no additional
singularities to those of spin-1 and spin- 1

2 propagators (8), and (c) satisfy relations (17) and (18).

iv. an extension of qed that does not need to be regularized

the lagrangian ltr as dened by (9) and (10) has the same interaction and source terms as the qed lagrangian
lqed. so we dene the quantum eld theory based on ltr (trqed) by the n-point green functions and corresponding
s-matrix elements expressed in terms of qed diagrams where the spin-1 and spin 1
2 propagators (8) are replaced with
such propagators (11) and (14) that are their regularization. this denition of trqed is consistent with the t
hooft and veltman denition of a quantum eld theory directly in terms of feynman diagrams corresponding to its
lagrangian [6].

trqed is a realistic quantum eld theory, because (i) trqed propagators (11) and (14) have no additional singu-
larities and admit the kallen-lehman representation, and (ii) trqed n-point greens functions are causal and the
corresponding s-matrix is unitary to any order in the ne structure constant. to show this we may follow the t hooft
and veltman proof for the case of unitary regulators [2].

in the asymptote   , the propagators (11) and (14) of trqed behave by (2) and (3) the same way as
unitary regularized spin-1 and spin 1
2 propagators (8) when the auxilliary masses tend to innity. so we can compute
the renormalized n-point greens functions of qed from the n-point green functions of trqed by renormalization,
choosing appropriate dependence of e, s1, s1/2, q1, and q1/2 on , and then limiting   . so trqed is at least as
good as qed for modeling quantum electrodynamic phenomena: trqed is a realistic extension of qed that requires
no regularization, while qed can be regarded as a physically appropriate simplication of the more complicated
trqed by renormalization.

the question remains what physical phenomena can we model by the trqed lagrangian better than by the qed
lagrangian. e.g.: (i) up to any value of |k2| the dierences between photon and electron propagators (8) and their
regularizations (11) and (14) can be made as small as desired if the cut-o parameter  is suciently large. in such a
case, the propagators (8) provide a low-energy approximation to their regularizations, the trqed propagators (11) and
(14) whose ultra-high-energy behaviour looks physically more appropriatewe do not need to alter (regularize) it to
make the denition of trqed formally correct. as trqed propagators together with vertices determine trqed cross
sections, we may expect trqed to better model quantum-electrodynamic phenomena at higher energies than qed.
the question is how much better, especially if we use dressed propagators instead of the bare ones, (11) and (14),
in computing the diagrams of trqed. (ii) ever since the epr gedanken-experiment, it is known that interpretations
of certain quantum phenomena suggest existence of faster-than-light eects. the question is whether we can model
them using the euler-lagrange equations of ltr whose retarded solutions have unbounded front velocities, see ref. [3].

[6] motivations of t hooft and veltman [2] to dene a quantum eld theory directly in terms of the feynman diagrams are
consistent with the convictions: the feynman graphs and rules of calculation summarize quantum eld theory in a form
in close contact with the experimental numbers one wants to understand. although the statement of the theory in terms
of graphs may imply perturbation theory, use of graphical methods in the many-body problem shows that this formalism
is exible enough to deal with phenomena of nonperturbative characters . . . some modication of the feynman rules of
calculation may well outlive the elaborate mathematical structure of local canonical quantum eld theory . . .  of j. d.

[7] the fact that there are functions f (p2) and t(p2) and constants s1, s1/2, q1, q1/2, , and e such that trqed is as good as
qed for modeling electrodynamic quantum phenomena in general and probably better for modeling ultra-high-energy ones
gives support to our hypothesis [3]: the euler-lagrange equations of a theory that underlies the standard model in the
four-dimensional spacetime formally resemble some equations of motion underlying uid-dynamic equations in the kinetic
theory of gases.
