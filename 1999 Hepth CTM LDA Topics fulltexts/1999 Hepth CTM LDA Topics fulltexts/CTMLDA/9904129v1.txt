abstract

in the previous paper [hep-th/9904112], we argued that there exist bps

bound states of dp branes carrying certain units of quantized constant electric

eld for every p (with 1  p  8). each of these bound states preserves one
in this paper, we construct these
half of the spacetime supersymmetries.

bound state congurations explicitly for 2  p  7 from schwarzs (m, n)-
string or (f, d1) bound state in type iib string theory by t-dualities along

the transverse directions. we calculate the charge per (2)p1(p1)/2 of

(p  1)-dimensional area for f-strings in (f, dp) and the tension for each of
these bound states. the results agree precisely with those obtained previously

from the worldvolume study. we study the decoupling limit for the (f, d3)

bound state and nd that maldacenas ads5/cf t4 correspondence may hold

true even with respect to this bound state but now with an eective string

coupling rather than the usual string coupling. this coupling is quantized

and can be independent of the usual string coupling in certain limit.

i. introduction

in the absence of a complete formulation of m/string theory, bps p-brane solutions

from various supergravities, which are the low energy and/or weak-coupling limits of this

intrinsically non-perturbative unied theory, are almost the only sources from which reliable

non-perturbative information about this theory can be extracted. these solutions played

vital role in every major development in the past and will continue to do so. bps properties

obtained in the low energy and weak-coupling limits remain to be valid non-perturbatively for

the corresponding bps states. these properties should also be independent of whether they

are obtained from elds in bulk spacetime or from elds on the corresponding worldvolume.

for this reason, bps properties obtained from the supergravity p-brane solutions are often

used to obtain information about elds living on the corresponding worldvolume and vice-

versa. for example, the mass per unit p-brane volume calculated from a spacetime bps

dp-brane solution should correspond to the dp-brane tension of the corresponding born-

infeld action. this is trivial for simple dp-brane solutions. but it is quite non-trivial for

complicated solutions such as bps bound state solutions. for example, the tension formula

of (m, n)-string bound state of schwarz [1], with m, n relatively prime integers, can be

used to determine the corresponding d-string worldsheet u(1) eld strength, in the linear

approximation, as gm with g the string coupling [2]. this in turn can be used to determine

the point charge due to the ending of a fundamental string (for short, f-string) on a general

dp-brane.

after all, a p-brane conguration represents the eld conguration created by the cor-

responding p-brane source just like a static electric eld due to a point charge represents

the eld surrounding the point source. static interactions should be the same whether we

calculate from the elds or from the sources. as mentioned above, bps properties should

be the same no matter whether they are obtained from the eld conguration or from the

source. however, apart from these bps properties, one must be careful in using them since

in general the elds and the source are not independent and they actually interact with each

2

other through the so-called backreaction except in the case where the so-called decoupling

limit is taken. in this limit, the modes propagating on the worldvolume will decouple from

the modes propagating in the bulk spacetime even though these spacetime modes may have

their origins from the worldvolume. so we expect that in the decoupling limit either the

worldvolume elds or the bulk elds can be used to describe the same physics. recently

proposed ads/cf t correspondence by maldacena [3] is one such example.

so bps p-brane solutions can provide not only the non-perturbative information but

also a basis for new types of strong-weak dualities. these are certainly important for us to

seek the eventual formulation of m/string theory, along with the powerful d-brane picture

of polchinski [4].

in this paper, we will construct new spacetime solutions for bps bound states of dp-

branes carrying certain units of the quantized worldvolume constant electric eld strength.

we argued in our previous paper [5] that such bps bound states should exist for 1  p  8
in both type iia (when p is even) and type iib (when p is odd) theories1. the non-

vanishing u(1) eld strength on the worldvolume indicates that such a bound state carries

information about f-strings ending on the dp-brane, yet preserving one half of the spacetime

supersymmetries. these dp-brane bound states should be identied with the so-called (f,

dp) bound states which can be obtained from the (m, n)-string of schwarz or (f, d1) bound

state in type iib string theory by t-dualities along the transverse directions. here integers

m, n are relatively prime. this is precisely the method which we will use here to construct

these solutions.

our worldvolume picture of these dp-brane bound states indicates clearly that the no-

tation f in (f, dp) represents actually an innite number of parallel ns-strings. precisely,
we have one ns-string per (2)p1(p1)/2 area over a (p  1)-dimensional plane which is
perpendicular to this string. each ns-string is m f-strings if the quantized worldvolume

1 in this paper, we specialize in cases of 2  p  7.

3

constant eld strength f01 = gm, with g the string coupling constant (where the eld lines

are chosen along x1 axis). these were obtained in [5] by noting that the (f, d1) worldvol-

ume action can be obtained from a (f, dp), for p  2, worldvolume action by t-dualities.
by this, we also determined the tensions for (f, dp) bound states in [5] which clearly in-

dicates that (f, dp) is a non-threshold bound state. we will show in this paper from the

corresponding spacetime solutions that indeed these are all true.

since we have constructed in this paper the space-time congurations for all the (f,

dp) bound states in type iia and iib theories, it would be natural to look at how they

aect the ads/cf t correspondences conjectured by maldacena. by examining the (f, d3)

conguration carefully, we nd that the decoupling limit in this case does not automatically
imply the space-time geometry to be ads5  s5 as happens in the case of maldacena, i.e.,
for simple d3-branes. we also nd that the string coupling constant in this case is replaced

by a nite but a smaller eective string coupling constant. however, we observed that by a

suitable rescaling of the coordinates the ads5/cf t4 correspondence may still hold true, but

now with respect to (f, d3) bound state rather than the simple d3-branes. the eective

string coupling constant in the near horizon region is quantized in terms of the integer n,

the 5-form ux and the integer m, the number of f strings per (2)2 area over the two

dimensional plane perpendicular to the f strings, where m, n are relatively prime integers.

this coupling can be independent of the usual string coupling at spatial innity in the limit

m  n.

this paper is organized as follows. in the following section, we discuss in some detail the

so-called vertical and diagonal (or double) dimensional reductions/oxidations in type iia

and type iib supergravities which are the basic methods we use to construct the (f, dp)

congurations. in section 3, we rst give a detail construction of (f, d2) as an illustrating

example. we then list results for each of (f, dp) for 3  p  7. we also present the
(w, dp) (with w representing the waves) solutions for 0  p  6 from these newly found
in section 4, we
(f, dp) congurations by t-dualities along the direction of f-strings.

calculate the charge per unit (p  1)-dimensional area for the f-strings and show that we

4

indeed have m f-strings per (2)p1(p1)/2 of (p  1)-dimensional area for these bound
states. we also calculate the mass per unit p-brane volume for these solutions and show

that the corresponding tensions agree precisely with what we obtained in [5] based on the

worldvolume study. in section 5, we study the decoupling limit for the (f, d3) bound state.

finally, we conclude this paper in section 6.

ii. diagonal and vertical dimensional reductions/oxidations

it is well-known that type iia and type iib superstring theories compactied on a circle

are equivalent by t-duality i.e. order by order in perturbation theory. more precisely,

iia and iib theories are interchanged by the t-duality transformation r  1/r, with r
the compactied radius, along with an interchange of momentum or kk modes with the

winding modes. however, this equivalence does not extend to the respective s1-compactied

supergravity theories due to the absence of the string winding modes. but this will not have

any eect on the massless modes in d = 9. therefore, the d = 9, n = 2 supergravity

obtained from type iia supergravity by the dimensional reduction must be equivalent by t-

duality to that obtained from type iib supergravity. this also follows from supersymmetry

because d = 9, n = 2 supergravity is unique up to eld redenitions. hence, the t-duality

acting on the d = 9 massless elds must map elds in iia basis to those in iib basis. this

feature, as we will see, is precisely what we need to obtain a bps solution in type iia theory

from a bps solution in type iib theory and vice versa by a t-duality transformation.

it is well-known that type ii theories contain the following simple bps states2:

type iia

w f ns5 kk

d0 d2 d4 d8

type iib

w f ns5 kk

d(1) d1 d3 d5

2 by simple, we mean an object whose charge is associated with only one antisymmetric tensor eld

in type ii theories. we have not included here the d9 branes, i.e., the so-called spacetime-lling

branes [6].

5

(2.1)

where w, f, ns5 and kk denote waves, fundamental strings, ns vebranes, and kk

monopoles, respectively, and they are associated with the nsns elds. also, dp (1 
p  8) are the so-called d-branes and they are associated with the so-called rr elds. the
action of t-duality along parallel or transverse direction on the above objects present in

type ii theories is given in the following table.

parallel transverse

dp d(p  1) d(p + 1)
f

the t-duality may be performed along either one of the worldvolume directions or one

of the transverse directions (for kk monopole, the transverse direction is taken to be the

nut direction).

it is clear from the above table that if we start from a (f, d1) bound state in the type

iib theory, we will have (f, d2) bound state in type iia theory by t-dualizing (f, d1)

along one of its transverse directions. then we can have (f, d3) bound state in the type

iib theory by t-dualizing (f, d2) along one of its transverse directions. repeating this

procedure, we can have (f, d4) from (f, d3), (f, d5) from (f, d4), (f, d6) from (f, d5)

and nally (f, d7) from (f, d6). we cannot obtain (f, d8) from (f, d7) by this procedure.

we will explain possible reasons behind this at the end of this section. if we t-dualize the

above bound states along the longitudinal direction of f in (f, dp) for 1  p  7, we have
(w, dp) bound states for 0  p  6 with w representing the waves.

the question now is how to implement the above t-duality at the level of solutions of

the iia and iib supergravities. as discussed above, the s1 compactied iia and iib su-

pergravities are not equivalent by t-duality except for the massless sector of d = 9, n = 2

6

supergravity. this implies that t-duality can be implemented in obtaining solutions in one

supergravity from the known solutions each with one isometry along the would-be compacti-

ed direction in the other supergravity. this is exactly the rationale behind the procedure of

the so-called vertical dimensional reduction and diagonal (or double) dimensional oxidation

or the diagonal reduction and vertical oxidation, depending on whether the t-duality acts

along a transverse direction or a worldvolume direction.

in this paper, we choose a convention such that hn denotes an n-form eld strength in

type iib supergravity or in d = 9, n = 2 supergravity in terms of the type iib basis and

similarly fn denotes an n-form in type iia supergravity or in d = 9, n = 2 supergravity

in terms of the type iia basis. if an n-form is reduced to an (n  1)-form from d = 10
to d = 9, we denote the resulting (n  1)-from with a superscript 1 indicating that it is
obtained by one-step reduction. for example, if the reduction is along one of the indices of
hn, we have hn  h (1)

n1  dz.

in the case of t-duality along a transverse direction of a bps p-brane solution (p  6) as
discussed in [7,8], we rst use the no-force condition for the p-brane conguration to obtain

a multi-center solution from a single center one by placing many p-branes parallel to each

other. without loss of generality and to be specic, let us assume that this p-brane is in type

iib supergravity. the multi-center solution can be obtained by the following replacement

in the corresponding harmonic function. for example, if a single-center harmonic function
h = 1 + qp/r7p with r2 = (y1)2 + (y2)2 +    + (y9p)2, then the multi-center harmonic
function will be given as,

h = 1 +xn

q(n)

p

| ~y  ~yn |7p .

(2.2)

in order to generate one isometry along the t-dual direction, say, y9p-direction, as pointed

out in [8], a continuous stack of p-branes with uniform charge density should be placed

along the coordinate z = y9p such that the summation in eq. (2.2) can be replaced by an

7

integration3. for the purpose of this paper, let us take a close look at this continuum limit.
we rst take ~yn = 2naz in eq. (2.2), with n  z, z the unit vector along y9p-direction and
a =  where  is the string constant. if we allow the range of the summation in eq. (2.2)
to be  < n <  and take all charges to be equal, i.e., q(n)
p = qp, then the multi-center
solution is an innite periodic array of p-branes. the solution would be a stringy one if

we take   0. under this limit, the summation in eq. (2.2) can also be replaced by an
integration, i.e.,

qp



xn=

1

| ~y  2naz |7p 

qp

2a z 



dz

(r2 + z2)(7p)/2 =

qp
r6p ,

(2.3)

where qp = cpqp with constant cp = qp+1/qp. the explicit expressions for qp+1 and qp
are given in the next section. in the above, we have now r2 = (y1)2 +   + (y8p)2. in other
words, one isometry is generated along the t-dual direction by the innite periodic array of

p-branes. once this solution is known, a bps p-brane solution in d = 9 can be obtained

from it. the einstein metric for d = 9 p-brane can be obtained from the corresponding

metric of d = 10 p-brane as (see, for example, the appendix of [9])

ds2

10 (type iib) = eb /(27)ds2

7b /2dz2,

9 + e

(2.4)

where b is a dilatonic scalar originating from the dimensional reduction. since we know

ds2

10 (type iib) and it also has one isometry along z-direction, we can read from the above

the new eld b and therefore the d = 9 einstein metric ds2

9. the d = 10 dilaton b

remains the same as the one for the solution of the innite periodic array of p-branes in

d = 10. the rule for reducing an n-form eld strength hn is as follows:

if it carries an

electric-like charge, it will remain the same in d = 9 whereas it will reduce to an (n  1)-
form, i.e., hn  h (1)
n1  dz, if it carries a magnetic charge. so we now obtain a d = 9 bps
p-brane solution from a d = 10 bps p-brane solution by the so-called vertical dimensional

reduction.

3this seems to work also for non-bps solutions as discussed in [8].

8

we expect that the t-dual of the above p-brane in type iib gives a (p + 1)-brane in type

iia. let us rst pretend that we know this (p + 1)-brane solution in type iia. we denote
the brane coordinate xp+1 = z ( we choose the brane along x1,   , xp+1-directions). all the
elds for a static bps (p + 1)-brane are usually independent of the brane coordinates. so

we have one isometry already along the z-direction. thus a bps p-brane solution in d = 9

can be obtained simply by the so-called diagonal or double dimensional reduction [10] on

the bps (p + 1)-brane solution of type iia supergravity. the two einstein metrics are now

simply related to each other by

ds2

10 (type iia) = ea/(27)ds2

7a/2dz2,

9 + e

(2.5)

where a is another dilatonic scalar due to this dimensional reduction. the iia dilaton a

remains unchanged. the n-form eld strength fn is reduced according to the following: if
it carries an electric charge, it will become an (n  1)-form in d = 9, i.e., fn  f (1)
n1  dz,
whereas it will remain the same if it carries a magnetic charge, just the opposite to the case

of vertical reduction. here we do not really change anything. it is just the same whether

we call the solution a (p + 1)-brane in d = 10 or a p-brane in d = 9. in other words, if we

know a p-brane solution in d = 9, we should obtain a (p + 1)-brane solution in d = 10 right

away and vice-versa. the process of obtaining a (p + 1)-brane in d = 10 from a p-brane in

d = 9 is called the diagonal oxidation.

the p-brane solution in d = 9 obtained from a known type iib p-brane solution is

described in terms of elds in type iib basis while in obtaining a (p + 1)-brane in type iia,

we need a p-brane solution in d = 9 described in terms of the elds in type iia basis. so we

need to map the elds in type iib basis to elds in type iia basis. this mapping is nothing

but the t-duality transformation for the solution. this is also the t-duality transformation

acting on the elds of d = 9, n = 2 supergravity discussed earlier. then t-duality on

eld strengths in d = 9, n = 2 supergravity or the corresponding p-brane solutions is the

identication hn = fn with the understanding that if hn is dened with a chern-simons

term so is fn. the mapping for the d = 10 dilaton  and the dilatonic scalar  between

9

the two versions of d = 9, n = 2 supergravity is

(2.6)

the above relations have been given or can be deduced, for example, from the appendix

in [9] where the relations between the corresponding gauge potentials are also given4.

using the above relations, we can obtain a p-brane solution in d = 9 in type iia basis

from a p-brane solution in type iib basis. then we obtain a bps (p + 1)-brane solution in

type iia by oxidizing this p-brane solution back to d = 10 as described above.

if we reverse the above process, we then obtain a bps p-brane solution in one theory

from a known bps (p + 1)-brane solution in the other theory now by a t-duality along a

world volume direction. the oxidation involved in this process is the so-called vertical one

[8].

now we conclude this section by explaining why we cannot obtain d8 brane solution in

the massive type iia supergravity from a d7 solution in the type iib supergravity by a t-

duality transformation along one of its transverse directions. first, it is not clear even now

whether the massive type iia supergravity has its origin in any of the known superstring

theories or even in m-theory (though we believe so). so it is not clear that there exists a

theory from which the massive type iia supergravity originates and is t-dual to the type

iib superstring theory. even if we have such a theory, the massless elds in d = 9 from

the s1-compactied massive type iia supergravity cannot describe the 8-brane in d = 9.

therefore, we do not expect that the d8-brane solution is related to a d7 brane solution in

4the precise relations between various elds in two dierent bases of the nine dimensional theory

are given in a recent paper [11]. we would like to thank chris pope for letting us know their results

prior to publication. these relations are also given in [12] but in a dierent conventions than we

use here.

10

the type iib supergravity by a t-duality transformation5. technically, as explained in [8],

the vertical reduction does not seem to apply when p = 7. by the same token, we cannot

obtain (f, d8) solution from (f, d7) solution by a t-duality transformation.

iii. (f, dp ) bound states

in this section, we will construct explicitly the (f, dp) bound state congurations for

2  p  7 from the known (f, d1) bound state conguration of schwarz [1] by a t-duality
transformation along one of the transverse directions described in the previous section. we

will give a detail construction for the case of (f, d2) as an example and present only the

results for the rest. once we have (f, dp) congurations for 1  p  7, we will also present
the results for (w, dp) for 0  p  6, i.e., a dp brane carrying waves in it, by a t-duality
along the longitudinal direction of f-strings. all these congurations preserve one half of

the spacetime supersymmetries.

the eld congurations of the (m, n)-string of schwarz (or (f, d1) bound state), with

m, n relatively prime integers, in type iib theory [1] are given in terms of our notations as:

the einstein metric,

ds2 (type iib) = h3/4[(dx0)2 + (dx1)2] + h 1/4dyidyi,

with i = 1,   , 8; the type iib dilaton,

eb = eb0 hh1/2,

the axion,

b =

mn(h  1) + b0 (m,n) eb0
n2h + (m  b0n)2 e2b0

,

and the nsns 3-form eld strength h3 (nsns) and rr 3-form h3 (rr),

(3.1)

(3.2)

(3.3)

5we merely mean this at the level of supergravity solutions. as we know, in string theory, d8

brane does seem to be related to d7 brane by a t-duality.

11

h3 (nsns) = 1/2
h3 (rr) = 1/2

(m,n) eb0 (m  b0n)dh1  dx0  dx1,
(m,n)hb0 (m  b0n) eb0  n eb0i dh1  dx0  dx1.

(3.4)

in the above, b0 and b0 represent the asymptotic values of the type iib dilaton and

axion, respectively. the sl(2, z) invariant -factor is

(m,n) = (m  b0n)2eb0 + n2eb0,

and the sl(2, z) invariant harmonic function h is

h = 1 +

q1
r6 ,

(3.5)

(3.6)

where the radial distance r2 = (y1)2 + (y2)2 +    + (y8)2 and the quantized central charge
q1 is

q1 = 25231/2

(m,n),

with  the string constant. we have also introduced a second harmonic function

h =

(m  b0n)2eb0 + n2heb0

(m,n)

,

(3.7)

(3.8)

which approaches unity as r  .

before we move on to the constructions of (f, dp) bound states, we x a few conventions.

the rr-charge of the dp-brane in (f, dp) is dened [15] as,

ep =

1

20 zs 8p

ea(p)  gp+2,

for noether electric charge, and

gp =

1

20 zsp+2

gp+2,

(3.9)

(3.10)

for topological or magnetic-like charge.

in the above 20 = (2)7/22. for a noether
charge, the integration is over an asymptotic (8 p)-sphere surrounding the dp-brane while
for a magnetic-like charge, the integration is over an asymptotic (p + 2)-sphere surrounding

12

the dp-brane. also, gp+2 = hp+2 for type iib theory while gp+2 = fp+2 for type iia theory.

the constant a(p) = (p  3)/2 for dp-branes in both type iia and type iib theories. the
above denitions are also valid for nsns branes, i.e., nsns strings and vebranes, but with

a(p) = (p  3)/2. however, the charge associated with the f-strings in the (f, dp) bound
states cannot be calculated using the above simple formula. we will discuss this in the next

section. in this paper,  always denotes the hodge dual. n denotes the volume form on an
n-sphere where the volume of a unit n-sphere is

n =

2(n+1)/2

((n + 1)/2)

,

and the unit charge for a dp-brane is given as,

qp
0  (2)(72p)/2(3p)/2.

(3.11)

(3.12)

(f, d2) bound state: now in order to construct this bound state we rst need to

construct, as described in the previous section, the solution corresponding to an innite

periodic array of (m, n)-strings along z = y8 axis. the harmonic function in that case

would be given as,

h = 1 + q1



xn=

1

| ~y  2naz |6 ,

(3.13)

where z denotes the unit vector and a = . in the limit   0, the summation in the

above harmonic function can be replaced by an integration, i.e.,



xn=

 z 



dz
2a

.

(3.14)

note that writing ~y = ~y + zz and so, | ~y  2naz |6= [r2 + (z  2na)2]3, with r2 =

(y1)2 +    + (y7)2, we have,



xn=

1

| ~y  2naz |6  z 



dz
2a

1

(r2 + z2)3 =

3

16a

1
r5 .

(3.15)

so the new harmonic function describing the innite array of (m, n)-strings along the

z-direction is

13

h = 1 +

q2
r5 ,

(3.16)

where we have dropped the tilde above the radial distance and will continue to do so from

now on. the central charge q2 in (3.16) is

q2 =

3q1
161/2 = 625/21/2

(m,n),

(3.17)

the harmonic function is now independent of the z-coordinate. in other words, the einstein

metric (eq. (3.1)) expressed in terms of this harmonic function possesses one additional

isometry along the z-direction. if we now compactify the metric along z-direction, eq. (2.4)

will give

7b /2 = h 1/4,
e

and the 9-d einstein metric will be given as,

ds2

9 = h5/7[(dx0)2 + (dx1)2] + h 2/7dyidyi,

(3.18)

(3.19)

where i = 1, 2,   , 7. for the 9-dimensional solution, the type iib dilaton, axion and nsns
and rr 3-forms remain unchanged with the replacement of the old harmonic function by

the new one. we have therefore obtained (m, n)-string bound state in d = 9 in the type

iib basis.

we now express all the relevant elds in type iia basis. the ds2

9 remains unchanged.

f3 = h3 (nsns), f (1)

3 = h3 (rr) and f (1)

1 = d. the type iia dilaton a and the dilatonic

scalar a can be obtained from b and b through eq. (2.6) as

ea = e3b0/4h3/4h1/2,
7a = e7b0/4h7/4h 1/2,

a detail discussion of the meaning and the other properties of the above solutions will be

given in the following section. we, however, continue this section to briey indicate how to

construct (w, dp) bound states in type ii theories from the (f, dp) bound states already

constructed.

so far, we have performed t-duality only along the transverse directions of the f-strings

to obtain (f, dp) bound states from the known (f, d1) bound state. but we note that

following the prescription given in the previous section, we can also t-dualize the above (f,
dp) solutions for 1  p  7 along x1-direction of the f-strings. this will give (w, dp)
bound state solutions for 0  p  6. we here present the einstein metric, the dilaton and
the kaluza-klein vector potential for each of these solutions. the remaining non-vanishing

elds can be obtained easily from the corresponding ones of (f, dp). for the (w, dp)

solutions we have the following einstein metric,

ds2

10 = e(p+1)b0/8 h(p+1)/8 [h1(dx0)2 + eb0 h1 h(dx1 + a0dx0)2

+eb0 h1((dx2)2 +    + (dxp)2) + dyidyi],

with i = 1, 2,   , (9  p); the dilaton,

and the kaluza-klein vector potential

a0 = 1/2

and the harmonic function h continues to be given by eq. (3.8). all the other quantities

are already given before. note that for m = 0 (also b0 = 0 and for simplicity we also set
b0 = 09), we have h = h and a0 = 0. then the above solution represents an innite

periodic array of dp-branes along the x1-axis. while for n = 0, h = 1, and the above

solution represents a gravitational wave propagating in x1-direction with isometries along
(x1, x2,   , xp)-directions. we will not discuss the (w, dp) bound states any further in this
paper and focus on (f, dp) ones for the rest.

iv. properties of (f, dp ) bound states

the worldvolume picture for a (f, dp) bound state described in [5] consists of constant

electric eld lines owing along, say, x1-axis in the dp-brane worldvolume. this picture

applies for each of our spacetime congurations of (f, dp) given in the previous section.

in order to see that, one can examine that for m = 0 (with b0 = 0 and b0 = 0 for
simplicity), the metric describes dp-branes lying along (x1, x2,   , xp)-directions while for
n = 0 (hence h = 1), it describes f-strings lying along the x1-direction with isometries along
(x1, x2,   , xp)-directions. so, this conguration indeed describes f-strings within the d-
branes in consistency with our worldvolume picture. in order to make such an identication

more precise, we need to calculate the charges carried by the dp-brane and by the f-strings,

and also the mass per unit p-brane worldvolume, and compare them with what we obtained

in [5] based on the worldvolume approach.

let us rst calculate the rr charge for the dp-brane in a (f, dp) bound state con-

guration given in the previous section. this can be done easily using either eq.(3.9) or

eq.(3.10) depending on whether the charge is electric-like or magnetic-like with the corre-

sponding explicit (p+2)-form eld strength given in the previous section. we have ep = n qp
0

for an electric-like rr charge or gp = n qp

0 for a magnetic-like rr charge. the integer n

originates from that of the d-string in the (f, d1) bound state. so the rr charge is au-

tomatically quantized given the quantization of d-string charge, a well-known fact that the

charge quantization for one extended object will imply charge quantizations for the rest of

the extended objects in string/m theory. this is consistent with our worldvolume result.

note that qp

0 q6p

0 = 2.

20

as hinted earlier, eq. (3.9) cannot be applied simply to calculate the electric-like charge

associated with the f-strings in (f, dp). the reason is, as explained in [5], that the notation

f in (f, dp) means actually an innite number of parallel strings in the bound state. as

mentioned in [5], there is one ns-string (or equivalently m f-strings) per (2)p1(p1)/2 of

(p  1)-dimensional area. we will show later in this section that this is indeed true. in 1 +
3 dimensional electrostatics, we know that in order to use gauss law to obtain the charge

per unit length for a uniform line distribution of charge, we have to choose a cylinder (with

the line charge at the center) as the gauss surface rather than a 2-sphere as for a point

charge. for the present case, we therefore should choose the integration in eq. (3.9) over
rp1  s8p rather than over an asymptotic s7. we can therefore have charge per unit
(p  1)-dimensional area for the f-strings.

in order to give meaningful calculations for this quantity and for the mass per unit

dp-brane worldvolume which will be used to determine the tension for a (f, dp) bound

state, we need a good asymptotic behavior for the metric such that the (p  1)-dimensional
area and the worldvolume can be dened with respect to certain frame metric. this is

also necessary for us to make comparisons with the results obtained in [5] based on the

worldvolume analysis. let us take a close look at each einstein frame metric for those (f,

dp) bound state congurations. they, along with the corresponding dilatons, can actually

be expressed in a unied way as

ds2 = e(p1)b0/8 h(p1)/8 h 1/4 [h1((dx0)2 + (dx1)2)

+eb0 h1 ((dx2)2 +    + (dxp)2) + dyidyi],

for the metric with i = 1, 2,   , 9  p; and

e = e(5p)b0/4 h(5p)/4 h1/2.

for the dilaton. in the above, the harmonic function h is

h = 1 +

qp
r7p ,

21

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

with

(m,n)20qp
1/2
(7  p)8p
and the harmonic function h is given by eq. (3.8).

qp =

0

,

(4.4)

note rst that the constants b0 and b0 appearing in all the above solutions are no

longer the asymptotic values for the dilaton and the axion except for the original (f, d1)

bound state conguration. actually, the axion for p = 3, 5, 7 has nothing to do with the

constant b0. in fact, b0 is the asymptotic value of the (p 1)-form rr gauge potential in
the corresponding (f, dp) conguration. the asymptotic value of dilaton for every p except

for p = 5 is related to the original b0 but not equal. this can be understood from the fact

that a t-duality transformation shifts the dilaton value [16]. from the dilaton expression for

each of the above solutions, we can see that the asymptotic value of the dilaton is reduced by a

quarter of b0 for every t-duality transformation. for p = 5, the asymptotic value vanishes.

second, even though we start with an einstein metric for (f, d1) which is asymptotically

minkowski, none of the metrics derived by t-duality transformations remains to be so. even

worse, none of them remains asymptotically as a constant scaling factor times minskowski

metric. however, there exists a constraint on the asymptotic behavior of the einstein metric

for the (f, d1) bound state conguration which preserves not only the asymptotic behavior

for each of the derived einstein metrics but also the asymptotic value for the dilatons10.

this turns out to be the one which imposes the corresponding string metric rather than

the einstein metric to be asymptotically minkowski. this constraint has been used in the

literature and once again we see its signicance. we will discuss possible reasons behind

this and other related issues in a separate paper.

once we make such a choice for the asymptotic metric, eq. (4.1) and (4.2) become

ds2 = eb0/2 h(p1)/8 h 1/4 hh1((dx0)2 + (dx1)2)

+h1((dx2)2 +    + (dxp)2) + dyidyii ,

(4.5)

10this remains true also for the (w, dp) bound states.

22

and

e = eb0 h(5p)/4 h1/2.

(4.6)

the harmonic function h is given by eq. (4.3) but with qp  e3b0/2qp with qp given
in eq. (4.4). the expressions (4.5) and (4.6) have the above mentioned properties. for

example, the asymptotic value for the dilaton is always b0, the one in the original (f, d1)

bound state. in what follows, we simply use 0 rather than b0 as the asymptotic value

for the dilaton. we give below the explicit form of nsns 3-from eld strength11 g3 for the

purpose of calculating the charge per unit (p  1)-dimensional area for f-strings which is

g3 = 1/2

(m,n) e0/2 (m  b0n) dh1  dx0  dx1.

(4.7)

as discussed above, the charge per unit (p 1)-dimensional area for the f-strings should

be calculated as,

e1 =

1

20 zrp1s 8p

(e  g3 +   ),

(4.8)

where    indicates possible non-vanishing chern-simons terms. actually, the chern-simons
terms do contribute to this charge. the charge e1 itself must be innite since we have an

innite number of f-strings. but we expect that e1/ap1 should be nite with ap1 =
r dx2      dxp the coordinate (p  1)-dimensional area. indeed, we nd

|e1|/ap1 = mqp
0,

(4.9)

as mentioned in [5], we have one nsns-string (or m f-strings) per (2)p1(p1)/2 of (p1)-
dimensional area from the worldvolume point of view. so, in order to compare with our

interpretation for the f-strings along x1-direction we must multiply the left side of the

above equation with this (p  1)-dimensional area. thus we obtain,

(2)p1(p1)/2 |e1|
ap1

= 20 mtf ,

(4.10)

11g3 = f3 in type iia while g3 = h3 (nsns) in type iib.

23

now in order for the left hand side of eq.(4.10) to represent the charge of f-strings per
(2)p1(p1)/2 of (p  1)-dimensional area, we must replace the coordinate area ap1 by
the one measured in string metric asymptotically. but, since we have chosen our string metric

to be asymptotically at, they are the same. note also that according to our denition the
charge ep of the p-brane is related to the corresponding tension tp as ep = 20tp and
therefore, eq.(4.10) clearly states that there are indeed m f strings in the (f, dp) bound
states per (2)p1(p1)/2 of (p  1)-dimensional area, conrming our interpretation.

there is another way to obtain the above result which gives a direct link between the

spacetime f-strings and the worldvolume electric ux lines. this will be important for our

discussion of the ads5/cf t4 correspondence given in section 5. the low-energy eective

eld theory on a dp brane worldvolume contains a coupling,

1
t p

0 g z dp+1b(2f ),

(4.11)

where b2 is the pull-back of the nsns 2-form potential on the worldvolume, f is the

worldvolume gauge eld strength12, t p

0 = 1/[(2)p(p+1)/2] is the p-brane tension units and

g = e0 is the string coupling. because of this term the equation of motion takes the form

(in terms of our conventions)13

d(e  g3 +   ) =

2 2
0

g tf t p

0  f  9p,

where  in g3 denotes the hodge dual in d = 10 spacetime while the  in f denotes

the hodge dual within the (p + 1)-dimensional worldvolume.

a (9  p)-form delta function on the dp brane worldvolume. we use this equation for the
purpose of relating the f-string charge to the electric ux of gauge eld on the worldvolume.

(note that a similar equation has been used in [17] for the charge conservation.) in order to

12strictly speaking, we should use f = f  b2 instead.
13here, we do not include an f-string source to the equation of motion since we are considering

an innite number of parallel f-strings in the bulk.

24

get the charge of f-strings in (f, dp) bound state, we should integrate the above equation
on rp1  r9p. we have
zrp1r9p

(e  g3 +   ),

d(e  g3 +   ) = zrp1s 8p
g tf t p

2 2
0

=

0 zrp1 f.

(4.13)

(4.14)

this gives,

e1 =

=

1

20 zrp1s 8p
20
f01ap1,
gtf t p
0

(e  g3 +   ),

where we have taken f01 as the only non-vanishing constant component of the u(1) gauge

eld strength on the worldvolume of dp-brane. if we denote q1 as the charge of f-strings

per (2)p1(p1)/2 area, we have

q12 0

= f01/g,

(4.15)
where q1/20 is the total tension of these f-strings. so we establish the precise relationship
between the f-strings and the electric ux lines. if we take q1/20 = mtf from the above
calculated value, we have f01 = gmtf which agrees precisely with what we obtained in [5].

certainly, the other way around is also true.

we now use the metric eq. (4.5) to calculate the mass per unit p-brane volume for a (f,

dp) bound state and compare the result with what we obtained in [5]. in doing so, we need

to generalize the adm formula in [18] to accommodate the following metric,

ds2 = a(r)dt2 + b(r)dr2 + r2c(r)ddp2 + d(r)ijdxidxj + e(r)kldxkdxl,

(4.16)

where d is the spacetime dimensions, p is the spatial dimensions of a p-brane, and indices

(i, j = 1, 2,   , m) and (k, l = m + 1,   , p). if a() = b() = c() = d() = e() =
ap (with ap a constant) [19], we have the adm mass per unit p-brane volume as

mp = 

 d+1
22
0

d+1rc(r) + m r

[( d + 1) r
( d + 1) r d (b(r)  c(r))]r

d+1rd(r) + (p  m) r

d+1re(r)

,

(4.17)

25

with d = d  p  3. applying the above formula to our case, we get the mass per unit
p-brane volume for a (f, dp) bound state as

mp = gqn2 + g2(m  b0n)2 t 0

p ,

(4.18)

where we have used qp = 1/2

(m,n)e30/220qp

0/[(7  p)8p], the expressions for qp

0 from

eq. (3.12) and the -factor from eq. (3.5), respectively. here t p

0 = 1/[(2)p(p+1)/2] is the

p-brane tension units and g = e0 is the string coupling. we can relate the mp and the

tension tp(m, n) of (f, dp) in many ways. for example, they can be related by looking

at the scaling behavior of the energy-momentum tensor due to the contribution of the dp-

brane worldvolume action under a constant rescaling of the spacetime metric. but we here

use a very simple approach. we know that mp must be proportional to tp(m, n) and the

proportionality constant must be some power of the constant ap, i.e., mp = a

p tp(m, n) with

 an as yet undetermined constant. note that here ap = g1/2. when m = 0, b0 = 0, we

know tp(0, n) = nt p

0 . so we have  = 4
and we get mp = g2tp(m, n) in general. using this relation and eq.(4.14) we nd the tension

0 /g and from eq. (4.17) we also have mp = gnt p

tp(m, n) for the (f, dp) bound state as

tp(m, n) =

1

gqn2 + (m  b0n)2g2 t p

0 ,

(4.19)

which agrees precisely with what we obtained in [5] for b0 = 0. this also shows that (f,

dp) is a non-threshold bound state.

v. decoupling limit for the (f, d3) bound state

the properties of the (f, dp) bound states studied in the previous section are either

the bps ones or the consequences of bps properties. therefore, it is not surprising that

we nd agreements in both the spacetime and the worldvolume approaches even though,

strictly speaking, a at background is always assumed in the worldvolume study for these

bound states in [5]. these calculations clearly demonstrate that our spacetime bound state

26

congurations (f, dp) are identical to those bound states obtained from the worldvolume

study in [5]. the f-strings in (f, dp) should be identied with the electric ux or eld lines

in the corresponding gauge theory living on the worldvolume. now the question is: can the

same ads/cf t correspondences conjectured by maldacena in [3] for p = 3 and by itzhaki

et al in [20] for p 6= 3 be proposed in a similar fashion based on the (f, dp) bound states
rather than on the simple dp branes? if so, can we learn anything new? we will examine

these for the p = 3 case in the following. the analysis for p 6= 3 can be made similarly as
for the p = 3 case along the line given in [20].

in general, when the so-called d-branes appear in string theory, we need to consider

not only the modes that propagate in the bulk but also the modes that propagate on the

d-branes. the modes propagating on the d-branes are associated with open strings ending

on the d-branes. in general, these modes interact not only among themselves but also with

the modes propagating in the bulk. however, there exists a limit that decouples the modes

propagating on the branes from the modes propagating in the bulk and is also typically a

low energy limit. the latter says that the modes on the brane are just the massless ones of

the open strings. in this limit, the d-brane theory becomes the corresponding sym theory

(for p  3).

in the case of p = 3, the d3 brane theory is described by n = 4 sym in 1 + 3 dimensions
under this limit. but the d3 brane conguration is also described in terms of the metric

and other elds in the bulk. the so-called decoupling or eld theory limit is

g2
ym = 2g = xed,

  0,

(5.1)

where g = e0 is the string coupling constant and gym is the yang-mills coupling constant.
note that the ten dimensional newton constant 2  g24 vanishes in this limit as it should
be. under this limit, the bps d3-brane conguration in the bulk becomes at minkowski

for any xed non-zero r. therefore, to have something nontrivial, we need to consider an

additional limit,

u 

r


= xed,

  0.

27

(5.2)

the above says that we keep the mass of the stretched strings between d3 branes xed.

this u actually sets the energy scale in the eld theory since it is the expectation value of

the higgs. this also implies that we are considering nite energy congurations in the eld

theory. as discussed in [3], if we consider n parallel d3 branes, then the above decoupling

limits say that we are bringing the branes together but the higgs expectation value corre-

sponding to this separation remains xed. the resulting theory on the brane is n = 4 u(n)
sym theory in 1 + 3 dimensions. in what follows, we simply call eqs. (5.1) and (5.2) as

the decoupling limit.

under the decoupling limit, the string metric describing the d3 branes becomes
ads5  s5. the isometry of ads5 is so(2, 4) and this is also the conformal group in 1 + 3
dimensions. we also have isometries of s5 as so(6)  su(4). this symmetry is identical to
the r-symmetry of the n = 4 sym. after including fermionic generators required by super-
symmetry, we have the full isometry supergroup su(2, 2 | 4) for the ads5  s5 background,
which is identical to the n = 4 superconformal group. we would like to emphasize that
we have the conformal symmetry so(2, 4) only at u = 0. for any xed non-zero u, this

symmetry is spontaneously broken since u represents the expectation value of the higgs.

to validate the conguration of d3 branes as a stringy one, the large n limit has to be

taken given the xed but small string coupling14. it is well-known that there is an sl(2,z)

strong-weak duality symmetry in both type iib supergravity and n = 4 sym. these
symmetry identications, among other things, led maldacena to conjecture that the large

n, n = 4 sym theory with gauge group u(n) is actually equivalent to the ten dimensional
type iib supergravity on ads5  s5. however, the supergravity itself is not a consistent
quantum theory. on the other hand, the sym is a unitary quantum theory. moreover,

the above symmetry identications are independent of the large n limit (even though it is

needed to validate the solution). these two facts led maldacena further to conjecture that

14for large g, the d-string frame is chosen.

28

type iib string on ads5  s5 is equivalent to the n = 4 sym theory for a general n.

let us now apply the same process to the (f, d3) conguration obtained in section 3, i.e.,

taking the decoupling limit given by eqs. (5.1) and (5.2). in other words, we should examine

the near-horizon geometry of (f, d3) conguration with the string coupling g xed15. the

near horizon string-frame metric in this case is

u 2

ds2 =

and the dilaton is

(5.3)

(5.4)

it is clear from (5.3) and (5.4) that unlike the simple d3 brane, the near-horizon geometry
in this case is not automatically ads5  s5 and the eective string coupling, e, is still a
nite constant but is less than the string coupling16 g.

the above features may be expected given the appearance of an innite number of f-

strings in (f, d3) and the non-threshold bound state nature of this conguration. on the

other hand, in the decoupling limit, we expect that d3 brane can be described equivalently

either by the sym theory on the brane or by the type iib supergravity (or string) in the

bulk. depending on whether we consider excitations with respect to the simple d3-brane

vacuum or the (f, d3) bound state (chosen as a new vacuum), we have two descriptions

which are dierent in appearance but probably equivalent in essence. let us rst discuss

15for simplicity, we set b0 = 0 from now on.

16the dilaton for (f, d3) is actually not a constant in general, nevertheless it is bounded as

(cid:16)n2e0/(m,n)(cid:17)1/2

bound at r = 0.

e0 < e < e0, where the upper bound is obtained at r =  and the lower

29

the possible underlying iib string/sym correspondence for each of the above descriptions

in the strong sense, i.e., not taking the large n limit. we will discuss the large n limit in the

end.

if we choose the simple bps d3 brane conguration in the bulk or equivalently no

excitations in the sym on the brane as the vacuum, then the f-strings in the bulk or

equivalently the electric ux lines in the sym should be formed due to excitations with

respect to this vacuum. we know that the energy per unit 3-brane volume associated

with the f-strings in the bulk or the energy density associated with the electric ux lines

on the brane is nite. this implies that we have an innite amount of energy associated

with either the f-strings or the electric ux lines.

in other words, we should have u =

, which implies that the original conformal symmetry group so(2, 4) must be broken
spontaneously to some smaller symmetry group consisting of at most some translational

and rotational symmetries. it is not dicult to gure out the origin of u =  if we recall
the method we used in [5] to nd the (f, d3) bound state. as discussed in [5], the charge

conservation must imply that the innite parallel f-strings in (f, d3) originate from f-
strings along the radial coordinate r ending on the x2x3-plane placed at x1 =  17. these
f-strings ending on x2x3 plane are the open strings, each semi-innitely long, giving u = .
inside the bulk, we have f-strings along x1-axis, therefore we expect an so(1, 1) symmetry.
because of the ending or the charges on x2x3-plane placed at x1 = , we expect that
so(2, 4)  so(1, 1) so(2) for this near-horizon geometry. thus we nd that we actually
have so(1, 1)  so(2)  so(6) isometries for the near-horizon geometry of the (f, d3)
bound state for the choice of vacuum. on the sym side, we have the same answer. dilation

and the special conformal transformations are broken spontaneously for the same reason

mentioned above. only the subgroup so(1, 1)  so(2) of so(2, 4) will leave f01 = gmtf
invariant. so, following the similar argument as for the ads5/cf t4 correspondence, we

17this is chosen in order to preserve the so(6) isometry of s5.

30

may suggest that the type iib string on this geometry is equivalent to the n = 4 sym
theory in a state with quantized electric ux lines.

let us investigate how the (f, d3) bound state emerges as our vacuum for the second

description. examining carefully the metric and the dilaton, we can see that n2e0/(m,n)
factor is the source which causes the near-horizon geometry to be not automatically ads5s5
and the eective string coupling to be less than the string coupling g. explicitly, we have

this factor

n2e0
(m,n)

=  1 +(cid:18)gm

n (cid:19)2!1

.

(5.5)

now if we rescale the coordinate time x0 and the coordinate x1 by a factor

(cid:16)n2e0/(m,n)(cid:17)1/2
ads5  s5. so, if we rewrite the metric in terms of the eective string coupling

, then in terms of the new coordinates the near-horizon geometry is

ge  e =

g

(cid:18)1 +(cid:16) gm

n (cid:17)2(cid:19)1/2 ,

(5.6)

we have

ds2 = "

u 2 + d2

5!# . (5.7)

the radius for the ads5 and the s5 is now given as

r2/ = q4nge,

(5.8)

the information about the f-strings in the (f, d3) bound state disappears in the above

metric. since the resulting near-horizon geometry diers from that of a simple d3 brane

with 5-form ux n only in the string coupling, we expect that the eects of the f-strings

are encoded in the eective string coupling ge. we will see that this is indeed true. with

respect to the new coordinates, we have so(2, 4)  so(6) isometries in the bulk at least
in appearance. how can we reconcile this with what we just discussed above on the sym

side? moreover, what is the physics behind such a rescaling?

31

in the case of simple d3 branes, the string coupling g = e0 remains the same whether

we are at r =  or at r = 0. this fact enables us to x the gauge coupling as g2
the sym theory describing the d3 branes in the decoupling limit. we do not expect that

ym = 2g for

such a relation will be modied for any nite energy excitations18. however, the story here

is dierent. the gauge coupling should, in the present case, be related to ge rather than g

as g2

ym = 2ge.

with respect to the metric in eq. (5.7), we may say that a simple d3 brane with 5-form

ux n plays as an eective vacuum conguration in the bulk with the string coupling ge.

this simple d3 brane is also described by a n = 4 u(n) sym theory in 1 + 3 dimensions
with gauge coupling g2
ym = 2ge. this is just the usual ads5/cf t4 correspondence except

we have a new coupling constant. let us dig out the mystery behind the above eective

vacuum. we expect that the tension for the simple d3 brane is nt 3

0 /ge.

if we use the

explicit expression for ge from eq. (5.6), this tension is

nt 3
0
ge

=

t 3

g qn2 + g2m2,

(5.9)

which is just the tension for the (f, d3) bound state. so this eective vacuum is nothing

but the (f, d3) bound state. as anticipated, the eects of the f-strings in (f, d3) is encoded

into the string coupling constant.

on the sym side, we have already hinted that the gauge coupling is now given by

g2
ym = 2ge. in the linear approximation,

(5.10)

where the second term for n = 1 is nothing but the contribution from the energy density

of the electric ux lines. in other words, the eect of the energy of the quantized electric

18 but it could be modied if the energy involved is innite, for example, the case we are presently

studying. if this happens, the sym theory may no longer be valid in describing the underlying

physics in general and string theory should be used instead. however, our discussion above for the

rst description may still be valid since it is based on the bps (f, d3) conguration.

32

ux lines is absorbed into the gauge coupling. this is in accordance with our spacetime

picture just discussed. therefore, the resulting sym theory should be the one describing

the excitations with respect to the (f, d3) bound state. the superconformal symmetry

should then be restored. we therefore have a consistent picture both in the bulk and on the

brane in the decoupling limit.

our study lends further support for maldacenas ads5/cf t4 correspondence and shows

that it holds true even for the non-trivial d3 brane congurations. the new input for this

correspondence is that we should use the eective string coupling constant instead of the

usual one.

the two descriptions studied may be equivalent but the picture for the rst one is surely

complicated. the reason for this is our improper choice of the vacuum state. if we take the

large n limit, i.e., n  m for xed g, the eective string coupling becomes the usual string
coupling g. the f-strings in the (f, d3) now play a minor role with respect to the d3 branes

sym side, on the other hand, we have the gauge coupling g2

which can be seen from the tension formula t3(m, n) = n/g [1 + (m/n)2g2/2] t 3

0 . on the
ym = 2g(1(m/n)2g2/2) which
implies that electric ux lines plays the minor role. thus the ads5/cf t4 correspondence

with respect to (f, d3) bound state is simply reduced to that of the simple d3 brane

conguration. we also expect that the full isometry supergroup su(2, 2 | 4) in the bulk
and the superconformal symmetry in the sym theory are restored under this limit in our

rst description above. this description is therefore also reduced to the usual ads5/cf t4

correspondence. this large n limit also validates the (f, d3) conguration as a stringy one.

let us now comment on the eective string coupling ge given by eq. (5.6) in the near-

horizon region. it is clearly quantized in terms of relatively prime integers n and m and

is always less than the string coupling g. in particular, in the limit m  n, it becomes
ge = n/m  1, independent of the string coupling g. in other words, the eective string
coupling in the near-horizon region is completely determined by integer n, the 3-brane

charge, and m, the number of f-strings per (2)2 area over the x2x3-plane, in this limit.

we will continue this study in a more general d3-brane conguration, namely, ((f, d1),

33

d3) bound state in a forthcoming paper [21].

vi. conclusion

to summarize, we have constructed, in this paper, explicitly the (f, dp) non-threshold

bound state congurations for 2  p  7, starting from the known (f, d1) conguration
of schwarz by t-duality transformation along the transverse directions of the strings. we

have also presented the solutions for (w, dp) non-threshold bound state congurations for

0  p  6 by t-duality transformations on the newly obtained (f, dp) ones along the
longitudinal direction of f-strings in (f, dp). we have shown explicitly that there are m
f-strings per (2)p1(p1)/2 of (p  1)-dimensional area which agrees with our previous
result based on the worldvolume study. we have also calculated the tensions for the (f,

dp) bound states which once again agree with our previous results. these two facts conrm

our assertion made in our earlier paper that the bound state studied in [5] can indeed be

identied with the (f, dp) bound states here. all of these bound states preserve one half

of the spacetime supersymmetries.

from the d-brane worldvolume point of view, each of these bound states consists of

a dp-brane carrying certain units of quantized electric ux or eld line. but from the

spacetime point of view, we have type ii strings (either type iia or iib strings) lying along

one direction in the corresponding dp-brane worldvolume. in this paper, we have shown

that for each of the bound states considered, the type ii strings can be identied with the

electric ux lines in the gauge theory living on the corresponding dp brane worldvolume.

in the p = 3 case, we have studied the corresponding decoupling limit and found that the

ads5/cf t4 correspondence may still hold true but now with respect to the (f, d3) bound

state with an eective string coupling constant. the f-strings in the (f, d3) bound state

or the electric ux lines in the corresponding sym theory play the role of reducing the

respective coupling constant in general. the string coupling in the near-horizon region is

found to be quantized in terms of the relatively prime integers n, the 3-brane charge, and

34

m, the number of f-strings per (2)2 area over the x2x3-plane. it becomes independent

of the asymptotic string coupling g in the limit m  n.
