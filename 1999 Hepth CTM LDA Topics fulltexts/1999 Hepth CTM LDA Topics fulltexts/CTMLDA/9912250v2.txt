abstract

we show that next-to-extremal correlators of chiral primary operators in n =4 sym theory
do not receive quantum corrections to rst order in perturbation theory. furthermore we
consider next-to-extremal correlators within ads supergravity. here the exchange diagrams
contributing to these correlators yield results of the same free-eld form as obtained within
eld theory. this suggests that quantum corrections vanish at strong coupling as well.

1 introduction

among its variety of applications, the maldacena conjecture [1, 2, 3] has been at the origin of
new results in four-dimensional quantum eld theory. in particular, it has lead to the discovery
of new non-renormalization properties of n =4 super yang-mills theory (sym). many of these
properties refer to correlation functions of chiral primary operators, which are scalar composite
operators in the symmetric traceless representation of the su(4) r-symmetry group with
dynkin labels [0, l, 0]. in [4], the ads/cft correspondence was used to argue that for these
operators the so-called extremal correlation functions, in which the conformal dimension of
one of the operator equals the sum of dimensions of all remaining operators, do not receive
any quantum corrections. thus, at least at large n, these correlation functions are expected
to be given exactly by their free eld form, which is a product of two-point functions. this
conjecture has been partially conrmed for any nite n by an explicit eld theory calculation
to rst order in perturbation theory and to leading order in the semiclassical expansion of
any instanton sector [5]. the non-perturbative non-renormalization of extremal correlators
has been studied by eden et al. in [6]. using superconformal ward identities together with
the grassmann and harmonic analyticity of the relevant superelds, these authors prove that
extremal correlators can indeed be expressed as products of two-point functions. applying
the reduction formula of [7], which relates the derivative of an n-point function with respect
to the coupling to an integrated (n + 1)-point function with an operator insertion, they also
show that extremal four-point correlators are independent of the coupling constant, under the
(plausible) assumption that there are no undesired contributions from contact terms [8, 9].

next-to-extremal four-point correlation functions, for which k4 = p3

subject to the same assumption, eden et al. also prove in [6] the non-renormalization of
i=1 ki  2, with ki the
conformal dimension of each operator.
in this letter we show explicitly that the radiative
corrections to next-to-extremal four-point correlators of chiral primary operators vanish to
order g2. this provides an independent check of the results in [6]. we then extend our
arguments to show that, to rst order in perturbation theory, next-to-extremal correlators with
an arbitrary number of points are not renormalized either. furthermore, for the four-point
functions, we examine also the corresponding scattering amplitudes within ads supergravity
and show that the exchange diagrams reduce to a free-eld form. the fact that the quartic
couplings have not been computed so far prevents us from giving a complete proof in ads1.
although the results in [6] hold for any n =2 scft and for any choice of the gauge group,
here we shall stick to n =4 sym with su(n) gauge symmetry.

in the case of extremal n-point functions (and also of general three-point functions), there
is only one su(4) invariant contraction of the avour indices, i.e., there is only one su(4)
singlet in the product of the representations of the operators involved. this fact was used
in [5] and in [11] to assign to the chiral operators a convenient irreducible representation of

1after this work had been completed, a paper appeared in which the relevant quartic couplings are evalu-
ated [10]. we briey comment on the new results in the last section, and leave for future work the complete
computation of the next-to-extremal four-point functions in ads supergravity.

the su(3)  u(1) subgroup of su(4) that is manifest in the n =1 language, such that the
avour and colour structures essentially decouple. however, in the case of n-point next-to-
extremal correlators there is more than one invariant contraction of the avour indices in
general. therefore, picking just one particular su(3) representation for each operator is not
general enough. our strategy will be to use the full su(4) structure to constrain the possible
wick contractions. then we show that each of these graphs vanishes for arbitrary su(3)
representations.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we show that the simplest four-point next-
to-extremal correlator, htrx 4trx 2trx 2trx 2i, is not renormalized to order g2. in section 3,
the proof is extended to any four-point next-to-extremal correlator, and in section 4, to any
next-to-extremal correlator with n points. in section 5 we discuss next-to-extremal four-point
functions in ads supergravity. finally, section 6 is devoted to conclusions, including a short
discussion of instantonic corrections.

l and r are chirality projectors. the three complex elds zi (i = 1, 2, 3) are combinations of
the six fundamental real scalars of n =4 sym, x i (i = 1, . . . , 6):

zi =

1

(x i + ix i+3), zi =

1

(x i  ix i+3).

(2)

the elds x i belong to the 6 of the su(4) r-symmetry group, whereas zi and zi transform in
the 3 and 3, respectively, of its su(3) subgroup. all elds are in the adjoint representation of
the su(n) gauge group. it will be useful to introduce dashed lines to represent the eective
vertex obtained from the two channels for a gluon exchange plus the four scalar contact
interaction, as indicated in fig. 1. the oriented solid lines indicate propagators connecting
a z and a z eld, with the arrow going from z to z. on the other hand, we shall use solid

3

lines without arrows to represent propagators of two x elds. the unoriented lines are
equivalent to the sum of two oriented lines with opposite orientations, since x i(x)x i(y) =
zi(x)zi(y) + zi(x)zi(y).

2 the correlator htrx 4trx 2trx 2trx 2i

we consider rst, for simplicity, the order g2 corrections to the next-to-extremal correla-
tion function htrx 4(w)trx 2(x)trx 2(y)trx 2(z)i. the single-trace chiral primary operators
trx k  trx {i1x i2    x ik} are traceless symmetric tensor products of the elds x i. the
operators trx 4 and trx 2 are in the 105 (with dynkin labels [0, 4, 0]) and the 20 ([0, 2, 0])
of su(4), respectively. these operators can be written as

trx k = x {i1
= x <i1
a1

a1    x ik}
   x ik>

ak tr(t a1    t ak)
ak str(t a1    t ak),

(3)

where x <i1    x ik> denotes a (nonsymmetric) traceless tensor product, t a are the hermitian
generators of su(n) with normalization tr(t at b) = ab/2 and the symmetric trace is dened
by

str(t a1    t ak ) = xperms 

1
k!

tr(t a(1)    t a(k)).

here and in the following we use the notation of ref. [11]. the case of multi-trace chiral
primary operators will be discussed in the conclusions.

disconnected diagrams do not contribute because they factorize into two connected sub-
diagrams, one of which (htrx 4(w)trx 2(x)i, for instance) cannot be a su(4) singlet. the
connected feynman diagrams contributing at the free-eld level are depicted in fig. 2. note
that diagrams with a scalar loop attached to a single point (a tadpole) vanish due to the

4

tracelessness of the operator trx 4. diagram a gives the following contribution to the free
eld correlation function:

where ii, ji, ki and li are the avour indices of each operator, c is a tensor in avour space,
g(x, y) = 1/(42(x  y)2) is the scalar propagator and

q4,2,2,2 = str(t a1    t a4)str(t a1t a2)str(t a3t b)str(t a4t b)

(6)

contains the colour structure. the space-time structure factorizes into a two-point function,
g(w, x)2, times a three-point function, g(w, y)g(w, z)g(y, z). the contributions of diagrams
b and c are obtained by the permutations (x, ji)  (y, ki) and (x, ji)  (z, li), respectively.
in the future we shall not consider the permuted diagrams explicitly, since they can be treated
in exactly the same way.

trx 2(z)i at order g2. we do not show explicitly diagrams that are obtained from these
by permutations of the operators. in diagrams c and d, the dashed line can be connected to
any of the two solid lines between x and w.

the diagrams contributing at order g2 (up to permutations of the operators) are depicted
in fig. 3. we shall show that each of them vanishes separately. for diagrams (actually, groups
of diagrams) a and b, this is due to known non-renormalization theorems for 2- and 3-point

functions, respectively. let us consider diagram b, which gives the contribution

where the superindices (0) and (1) indicate free-eld and rst (g2) order correlators, respec-
tively. since the scalar propagators are diagonal in avour space, the two avour indices j1
and j2 of trx 2(x) in (7) are contracted with two of the indices of trx 4(w), i1, . . . , i4, within
the free two-point function. this leaves a symmetric traceless tensor of rank 2. therefore,
as far as the avour structure is concerned, the operator entering the three-point function
at w is in the 20 of su(4). likewise, the contraction of the colour indices b1 and b2 with
a1 and a2 within the two-point function, and the normalization tr(t b1t b2) = b1b2/2, imply
that the colour indices of the two generators t a1, t a2 are contracted to give the casimir of
their representation, leaving only t a3 and t a4 in that trace. thus, the (order g2) three-point
function factor is

htrx 2(w)trx 2(y)trx 2(z)i(1),

(8)

with three chiral primaries in the 20. this expression must vanish, since it is known that
the correlator htr(x 2)(w)trx 2(y)trx 2(z)i does not receive quantum corrections. hence,
diagram b vanishes. a similar argument holds for diagram a, which vanishes as well.

any of the diagrams of fig. 3 can be decomposed into a sum of oriented diagrams with
arrows on the scalar lines. dierent orientations correspond either to dierent su(3) rep-
resentations in the su(4)  su(3)  u(1) decomposition of the operators or to dierent
wick contractions of a given set of su(3) representations2. the explicit colour and avour
structure of each diagram depends on the assignment of arrows to the scalar lines. however,
all the terms in the possible oriented diagrams contain the structure fabpfcdp, where a, b, c
and d are the colour indices of the four scalar lines involved in the gluon exchange or the
contact interaction. in the case of gluon exchange and of the contact interaction coming from
the d-term in the lagrangian, the colour indices a and b (and c and d) are attached to one
incoming and one outgoing scalar line, while for the f -term contact interaction, they are
attached to two incoming or two outgoing lines. the essential fact for the present argument is
that, for xed colour indices in the relevant scalar propagators, there are only three possible
colour combinations: fabpfcdp, facpfbdp and fadpfbcp. this structure is enough to prove that
any oriented diagram corresponding to the diagrams c, d, e and f vanishes.

let us consider diagram c. for any given orientation, its colour structure is given by:

str(t a1    t a4)str(t a1t b)str(t ct d)str(t dt a4)
(afa2bpfa3cp + bfa2cpfa3bp + cfa2a3pfbcp)
1
str(t a1    t a4)  (afa2a1pfa3a4p + bfa2a4pfa3a1p + cfa2a3pfa1a3p)
6
= 0,

=

(9)
2the chiral primary operators are linear combinations of su (3) irreducible representations. for instance,

if i = i, j = j  {1, 2, 3}, trx {i x j} = 1

2 tr(z(izj) + z(i zj) + z{i zj} + z{izj}).

6

where a, b and c are functions of the points w, x, y and z and of the avour indices, and we
have used tr(t at b) = ab/2. expression (9) vanishes since, for each term, two colour indices
of the totally symmetric str(t a1    t a4) are contracted with two indices of an antisymmetric
structure constant. the remaining diagrams, d, e and f , vanish for the same reason: they
involve a contraction of symmetric and antisymmetric tensors as well.

therefore, the correlator htrx 4(w)trx 2(x)trx 2(y)trx 2(z)i does not receive quantum cor-
rections at order g2. for this correlation function, the proof is simplied by the fact that the
trace of t at b gives a kronecker delta. in the next section we shall see that the argument can
be generalized to operators of higher dimension.

3 next-to-extremal four-point correlators

in this section we consider the correlation function htrx k1(w)trx k2(x)trx k3(y)trx k4(z)i,
with k1 = k2 + k3 + k4 2 and ki  2. each operator is in the su(4) irreducible representation
[0, ki, 0]. in order to show that its radiative corrections vanish at rst order, we shall groupas
we did in last sectionall the diagrams whose space-time part factorizes into a free two-point
subdiagram times a three-point subdiagram at order g2, or the other way round. then, we
shall invoke the non-renormalization theorems proved in [11] (see also [12]) for two- and three-
point functions to conclude that the sum of all these diagrams cancel. as we shall discuss, the
proofs given in [11] apply also to the mentioned subdiagrams, which involve chiral primaries
with insertions of extra su(n) generators in the trace of one of the operators. for the other
diagrams, we shall see that they vanish due to their colour structure.

let us consider rst the free-eld contributions.

it is impossible to construct a su(4)
invariant disconnected diagram, since (for i, j, l, m all dierent) ki = kj and kl = km cannot
hold at the same time. the next-to-extremality condition, together with tracelessness in
avour space, puts also severe restrictions on the possible connected feynman graphs.

trx k4(z)i at order g2. as in fig. 4, diagrams are drawn for k1 = 8, k2 = 3, k3 = 4
and k4 = 3. the dashed lines can be connected to any of the solid lines in each rainbow.
here and in the following, permutations are not shown explicitly. diagram h is just one of
the various diagrams that have two tadpoles connected by a dashed line.

the only diagrams contributing at the free-eld level are depicted in fig. 4. they all have

the same structure, so we shall focus on the rst one, which yields

ci1...ik1 ;j1...jk2 ;k1...kk3 ;l1...lk4 g(w, x)k2g(w, y)k31g(w, z)k41g(y, z)qk1,k2,k3,k4(n),

 str(t ak2+1    t ak2+k31t b)str(t ak2+k3    t ak1 t b).

(11)

we see that in the free-eld approximation the space-time structure factorizes into a two-point
function and a three-point function. the two-point function consists of a rainbow of scalar

8

lines connecting w and x, while the three-point function has two rainbows connecting w to
y and z, and one additional scalar line between y and z.

at order g2, the possible kinds of diagrams are depicted in fig. 5.

in addition to the
diagrams we show, there are others obtained by permutations of the operators at x, y, and
z, and by attaching the dashed line to dierent scalar lines in the rainbows.
it will be
sucient to study the set of diagrams in fig. 6, for the remaining diagrams can be shown to
vanish in exactly the same manner. as in the case of the correlator htrx 4trx 2trx 2trx 2i,
diagrams a and b only contain radiative corrections to a two-point and a three point function,
respectively.
in this case their vanishing follows from a simple generalization of the proof
in [11] of the non-renormalization of general correlators of two or three chiral primaries.

(13)

the operator entering the two point function at w is a symmetric tracessless tensor in avour
space, so it belongs to the [0, k2, 0] representation of su(4). therefore we are lead to consider
the two-point function of two chiral primaries of conformal dimension k2 in the representation
[0, k2, 0], but with k1  k2 additional su(n) generators inserted in one of the traces:

htrx k2(x)tr(x k2(w)t ak2+1    t ak1 )i.

the next step is to realize that the proof in [11] of the non-renormalization of the correlator
htrx ktrx ki applies also to the two-point correlator (13). indeed, it is clear that self-energy
corrections are not aected by the extra generators in the second trace. on the other hand,
the pairs of structure constants appearing in gluon exchanges and quartic vertices can be
converted into commutators within the rst trace. the sum of all these diagrams can then be
reduced to k2 identical terms, as in eqs. (2.5) and (2.6) of [11]. the key point is that there
are not additional factors in the rst trace that would give extra terms upon the application
of the identity

n

xi=1

tr(m1    [n, mi]   mn) = 0.

(14)

note that the presence of extra generators inside both traces would prevent us from using this
argument. therefore, after adding all contributions one nds that the radiative corrections to
the correlator in eq. (13) are of the form of eq.(2.7) in [11], and hence the non-renormalization
theorem for htrx 2trx 2i implies that they vanish.

in the same manner, the non-renormalization theorems for three-point functions imply that

diagram b vanishes. here, we must consider the correlator

htr(t a1    t ak2 x k1k2(w))trx k3(y)trx k4(z)i.

(15)

self-energy corrections are again trivial, and interactions relating scalar lines within one rain-
bow can be treated as in eq. (4.7) of [11] if one chooses to put the commutators inside the
second or third trace, which is always possible. furthermore, one can easily see that the ma-
nipulations carried out in [11] for diagrams with interactions among two dierent rainbows
can also be done in our case. indeed, as long as only one of the traces contains extra t s, there
is no obstruction to the use of eq. (14). therefore, the sum of all contributions is of the form
of eq. (4.9) of [11] and vanishes due to the non-renormalization theorems for htrx 2trx 2i
and htrx 2trx 2trx 2i.

let us study now the genuine four-point diagrams. each of them is a linear combination of
oriented diagrams. the general color structure of the interactions, which was discussed in last
section, will be sucient again to show that all possible oriented diagrams vanish. consider
diagram c of fig. 5. for any given orientation, it gives a contribution of the following form:

str(t a1    t ak1 )str(t a1    t ak21t b)str(t ct ak2+2    t ak2+k31t d)

 str(t dt ak2+k3    t ak1 )(cid:16)afak2

bpfak2+1cp + bfak2

cpfak2+1bp + c fak2

ak2+1pfbcp(cid:17) , (16)

where a, b and c  carry the space-time and avour dependence. the term involving c 
vanishes because fak2
ak2+1p is contracted to a trace that is symmetric in ak2, ak2+1. we convert
one of the structure constants in the terms involving a (b) into a commutator inside the

the traces must not be symmetrized in the generators arising from the structure constants.
each term in the sum contains a commutator that is antisymmetric in ak2, ai or in ak2+1, ai.
since the sum is contracted with a trace symmetric in those indices, the entire diagram
vanishes.

diagram d gives the contribution

for the terms involving a, b and c , the structure constant with the index ak2 can be
converted into a commutator inside the second, third and fourth trace, respectively. the
identity (14) then leads to a sum of terms with commutators [t ak2 , t ai] that cancel when

10

contracted with the rst symmetric trace. let us show this explicitly for the term involving
b:

ibfdbpstr(t a1    t ak1 )str(t a1    t ak21t b)

 str(t ak2+1    t ak2+k31[t ak2 , t p])str(t dt ak2+k3    t ak1 )

(19)

it is interesting to note that this argument would not hold if there were another scalar line
connecting the operators at y and z. such a diagram is forbidden by next-to-extremality, but
it can contribute to next-to-next-to-extremal correlators.

the remaining diagrams have a dashed line connected to a tadpole. all diagrams with
tadpoles must have interactions involving all the tadpole lines, for otherwise they would vanish
due to the tracelessness of the operators. diagrams e, g and h of fig. 6 vanish because all
possible terms contain the factor

faiaj pstr(t a1    t ak1 ) = 0,

where i = 1, 2, j = 1, . . . , k1 finally, diagram f has three possible terms, one proportional to
the color structure in eq. (20 ) and two to a factor of the form (i = 1, 2):

faibpstr(t a1    t ak1 )str(t bt ak2+1    t ak2+k31)
= istr(t a1    t ak1 )str([t ai, t p]t ak2+1    t ak2+k31)
= istr(t a1    t ak1 )
= 0.

therefore, we conclude that the correlator htrx k1(w)trx k2(x)trx k3(y)trx k4(z)i does not
receive quantum corrections to order g2. on the other hand, in the case of four-point correla-
tors that are neither extremal nor next-to-extremal, non-vanishing feynman diagrams (as the

11

one illustrated in fig. 6) contribute at order g2, and there is no apparent reason for them to
cancel. therefore we do not expect any non-renormalization theorem for k1 < k2 + k3 + k4 2,
in agreement with the argument of [6]. an example for this is provided by the explicit calcu-
lation of g2 corrections to htrx 2(w)trx 2(x)trx 2(y)trx 2(z)i in [13].

4 general next-to-extremal correlators

htrx k1(x1)trx k2(x2)   trx kn(xn)i, with k1 = pn
the reason is that the next-to-extremality condition implies that k1 > pn

the arguments given in last section can be directly extended to a general n-point function,
i=2 ki2 and ki  2. as in the case of four-
point next-to-extremal correlators, disconnected diagrams are forbidden by su(4) symmetry.
i=1 ki  kl  km for
any l, m, so that if two or more operators form a subdiagram disconnected from the rest of the
diagram, it is impossible to build a su(4) invariant subdiagram with the remaining operators.

figure 8: feynman diagrams contributing to an n-point next-to-extremal correlator at order
g2.

12

the free-eld connected feynman diagrams (fig. 7) are analogous to the corresponding
ones for four-point correlators: their space-time part factorizes into a product of (n  3) two-
point functions times one three-point function. a similar structure is preserved at order g2:
as is shown in fig. 8, the space-time part of all diagrams factorizes either into a free extremal
function of (n  4) points times a rst-order four-point next-to-extremal function (diagram
a) or into a free three-point next-to-extremal function times a rst-order extremal function of
(n  3) points (diagram b).

in diagram a, the operator that enters the four-point function at w is a traceless symmetric
tensor of rank ki + kj + kl2, where i, j, l  {2, . . . , n} label the other three operators involved
in the four-point function. hence, we are dealing with a next-to-extremal four-point correlator
of the form

htr(t a1    t ak1kikj kl+2x ki+kj+kl2(x1))trx ki(xi)trx kj (xj)trx kl(xl)i

(22)

we have proved in section 3 that next-to-extremal four-point correlators of chiral primaries are
not renormalized, and we only need to make sure that the argument also holds in the presence
of additional su(n) generators inside the rst trace. this is indeed the case since the extra
generators are included in the trace of the operator with highest dimension. therefore, only
one of the traces in the two- and three-point subdiagrams contributing to the correlator (22)
contains extra generators, as is necessary for the non-renormalization of these subdiagrams.
furthermore, the diagrams that cannot be factorized into a two-point and a three-point part
vanish as well since the property of the highest-dimension operator essential in the proof is that
it is totally symmetric in the colour indices, and this is also true in the presence of additional
generators. therefore, next-to-extremal four-point correlators with extra group generators
attached to the highest-dimension operator do not receive quantum corrections either.

similarly, diagram b involves an extremal correlator of n  3 chiral primaries, with extra

su(n) generators attached to the highest-dimension operator:

htr(t a1    t aki+kj 2x k1kikj +2(x1))trx k2(x2)   trx ki1(xi1)
 trx ki+1(xi+1)   trx kj1(xj1)trx kj+1(xj+1)   trx kn(xn)i.

(23)

here, i and j label the operators in the free-eld three-point subdiagram. the extremal
correlator in (23) can be shown to vanish using methods similar to the ones in section 3.
alternatively, we may observe that the proof in [5] of the non-renormalization of extremal
n-point correlators at order g2 holds also in the presence of extra generators. the arguments
in [5] are based on the space-time structure of the diagrams (which is colour independent)
and on the symmetry of the colour indices in the highest-dimension operator, which is not
aected by the extra generators.

thus, we see that the combination of non-renormalization theorems for extremal n-point
functions and for next-to-extremal four-point functions implies the vanishing of any next-to-
extremal n-point function.

13

5 next-to-extremal correlators within ads supergravity

further evidence for the non-renormalization of next-to-extremal correlation functions may be
obtained from calculations in type iib classical supergravity on ads5  s5 which, according
to the ads/cft correspondence, is dual to n =4 sym at strong coupling and large n.

the supergravity states corresponding to chiral primary operators of n =4 sym are certain
scalar mixtures, sk, of the trace of the graviton on s5 and the ve form eld on s5. these one-
particle states have the correct transformation properties under the superconformal group.
they belong to the [0, k, 0] representation of su(4) and have conformal dimension  = k.
in [14] the three-point amplitudes of these elds have been calculated and shown to be equal
to their free-eld values, in agreement with the eld theory results [11, 15]. in [4] it has been
argued that extremal n-point functions satisfy non-renormalization theorems as well, such that
to all orders in perturbation theory they are given by a product of two-point functions whose
coecient does not receive quantum corrections either. here we are interested in next-to-
extremal functions of four chiral primary scalars, sk1(x1), . . . , sk4(x4), with k1 = k2+k3+k42.
we use the methods for calculating correlation functions in ads space developed in [16],

[17], [18] and consider the euclidean continuation of ads5 whose metric is given by

figure 9: witten diagrams contributing to next-to-extremal four-point functions at large n.
to diagram a one has to add the two crossed channels for particle exchange in the bulk.

we calculate the spatial dependence of the exchange diagrams contributing to next-to-
extremal correlators by adapting an argument given in [4] for the extremal case. the two types

14

of connected witten diagrams contributing to four-point functions are depicted in fig. 9. the
quartic supergravity couplings required for the evaluation of the contact diagram are not yet
known, so we concentrate on the exchange diagrams. without loss of generality we consider
the channel where sk1(x1) and sk2(x2) join at y to the intermediate eld , which then splits
at z into the other two elds, sk3(x3) and sk4(x4), as shown in fig. 9. the exchanged eld
must be in a common su(4) representation of the tensor products [0, k1, 0]  [0, k2, 0] and
[0, k3, 0][0, k4, 0]. it is easy to see using young tableaux that the only common representations
when k1 = k2 + k3 + k4  2 are [0, k3 + k4  2, 0], [0, k3 + k4, 0] and [1, k3 + k4  2, 1]. the
exchanged eld must be in one of these representations, and it can be either a primary eld
or a su(2, 2|4) descendent.

for scalar primary exchange there are two possibilities: [0, k3 + k4  2, 0] and [0, k3 + k4, 0].
the exchanged eld has dimension k3 + k4  2 or k3 + k4, respectively. in the rst case, the
cubic vertex at y is extremal and the vertex at z is next-to-extremal, while in the second
case the vertex at y is next-to-extremal and the vertex at z is extremal. it is known from
supergravity [14, 19] that the cubic couplings, denoted by g(k1, k2, k), vanish at extremality
while they are nite in the subextremal case. on the other hand, divergent integrals appear
in extremal correlators. we shall regularize them by analytic continuation in the conformal
dimensions [20, 4]. it turns out that the zeros in the couplings combine with the poles in the
integrals to give a nite result.

the exchange of the primary sk3+k42 leads to the contribution

i1 = g(k1, k2, k3 + k4  2)g(k3, k4, k3 + k4  2)

5 k1(x1, y)k2(x2, y)g3+42(y, z)k3(x3, z)k4(x4, z).

(26)

the evaluation of this integral is based on realizing that the y-integrand, which leads to a pole
since the vertex at y is extremal, is dominated by the contribution when y  x1. for y  x1
we may approximate the bulk propagator by [17, 21]

such that the two integrals decouple and we have

here, r is a ve-dimensional neighbourhood of x1 for which the approximation (27) is valid.
we shall take r = {y  ads5, y0 < a, (~y  ~x1)2 < a2} for simplicity, but the result does not

15

depend on the shape or size of this region. iz is a next-to-extremal nite three point function
which may be evaluated using the methods of [16] to give

iz

2x13

2(31)x14

2(41) .

(31)

for the evaluation of iy we use analytic continuation such that   k2 + k3 + k4  2  k1  0,
which implies g(k1, k2, k3 + k4  2 + )  . then, by translating the integration variable
~y  ~y + ~x1, and by rescaling ~y = y0 ~w, we obtain

where br is the four-dimensional ball of radius r around ~w = 0. we have

(32)

(33)

(34)

we see that the rst term in the y0-integral gives a pole in  which is exactly cancelled by the
factor  arising from the coupling, and that the result is independent of a in the limit   0.
therefore the nal result for i1 as given by (26) is of the form

i1 

x21

22x34

2x13

1
2(31)x14

2(41) ,

which agrees with the eld-theoretical free-eld result of eq. (10).

the contribution from the exchange of the primary sk3+k4 is

(35)

(36)

this vanishes since the integral is nite and g(k3, k4, k3 + k4) = 0. to see that the integral is
nite we evaluate the y-integral by applying the method of [18] to the next-to-extremal vertex
at y which yields

i2 =g(k1, k2, k3 + k4)g(k3, k4, k3 + k4)

with nite coecients ak. all integrals in the sum are nite as well.

the descendent exchange graphs are more involved, and we do not study them in full
detail here, but give an argument from which we expect that descendent exchange does not
contribute to next-to-extremal correlators. the superconformal descendent eld  can be a
scalar or a tensor and must be in any of the three allowed representations: [0, k3  k4  2, 0],
[0, k3  k4, 0] or [1, k3  k4, 1]. hence, it has a conformal dimension   3 + 4 and is a
descendent of a chiral primary in the [0, k, 0] representation, with k  k3 + k4. the coupling
constants for the cubic vertices sk1sk2 and sk3sk4 [19] are related to primary vertices by
supersymmetry. the vertex sksk3sk4 is forbidden by su(4) symmetry if k > k3 + k4. thus
the only possibility is k = k3 + k4, which corresponds to an extremal vertex with a vanishing
coupling constant. therefore, the corresponding coupling for the vertex sk3sk4 must also
be zero. on the other hand, the vertex sksk1sk2 is next-to-extremal for k = k3 + k4. since
the conformal dimension of the eld  satises the relation   3 + 4, these diagrams
involve integrals similar to i2 in eq. (36). these integrals must be nite independently of the
spin of the intermediate eld, as the short distance behaviour of the bulk-to-bulk propagator
is universal. we conclude that diagrams with exchange of descendents do not contribute to
next-to-extremal functions.

finally, for a complete argument showing that the ads calculation yields the free-eld
result, it is necessary to calculate the contribution from the contact diagram. this is a
next-to-extremal four-point scalar function, which is known to be nite. since in this case
the entire integration region contributes, and not just a small region surrounding one of
the external points, logarithms are expected to appear and there seems to be no reason
for these logarithms to cancel such as to give a product of two-point functions. therefore,
the quartic couplings of the primary elds, g(k2 + k3 + k4  2, k2, k3, k4), has to vanish if a
free-eld form is to be obtained. in the case corresponding to the correlator considered in
section 2, htrx 4trx 2trx 2trx 2i, we can see the coupling constant g(4, 2, 2, 2) is indeed zero
by the following argument. the eld s2, corresponding to trx 2, is in the same multiplet as
the graviton (in the lowest kaluza-klein level), whereas s4, corresponding to trx 4, is in a
higher kaluza-klein level. on the other hand, it is believed that type iib supergravity on
ads5  s5 can be consistently truncated to include only the multiplet of the graviton, i.e.,
the eld content of the gauged n =8, ve-dimensional supergravity. consistency requires that
the equations of motion of the untruncated theory do not contain terms that are linear in
higher kaluza-klein modes. hence it implies, in particular, that g(4, 2, 2, 2) vanishes. more
generally, the results in [6] and our argument for the exchange diagrams suggest that all the
next-to-extremal quartic couplings of chiral primaries are zero.

6 conclusion

we have proved that next-to-extremal correlation functions of single-trace chiral primary
operators do not receive quantum corrections at order g2 in perturbation theory. this result

17

supports the (non-perturbative) results in [6] and generalizes them in the sense that it applies
to correlators of any number of points.

although we have dealt with single-trace operators for simplicity, next-to-extremal correla-
tors of multi-trace chiral primaries have an anologous non-renormalization property. this can
easily be shown using the non-renormalization theorems for two- and three-point functions of
multi-trace primary operators proven in [22], and by noting that the relevant property for the
vanishing of the diagrams that do not factorize into a two-point and a three-point function is
that each operator has to be totally symmetric in its colour indices. multi-trace operators have
this property as well due to the general fact that primaries are symmetric tensors. moreover,
the su(4) structure is also the same as for single-trace operators.

we have studied next-to-extremal correlation functions in ads supergravity as well. as
in our eld theory results, we have found that the exchange diagrams reduce to a product
of two-point functions. note that for i1 in (26) this occurs in a way that resembles the
eld-theoretical calculation of diagrams a and b in figs. 3 and 5 in sections 2 and 3: the
contribution (26) factorizes into a two-point and a three-point function, which both have a
free-eld form. on the other hand, i2 in (36) corresponds to a contribution which does not
factorize into a two- and a three-point function, and the fact that it vanishes independently of
its detailed space-time structure seems related to the fact that the non-factorizing eld theory
diagrams discussed in sections 2 and 3 are zero as well. of course, the ads calculation is
conjectured to describe the strong coupling regime, to which perturbation theory does not
apply. nevertheless, we see that the symmetries of the theory and the condition of next-to-
extremality enter the calculations in a similar way both at weak and at strong coupling, such
as to lead to agreeing results in both cases.

very recently, the quartic couplings necessary for a detailed evaluation of the contact di-
agrams within ads supergravity have been calculated in [10]. at least in the simplest case
it is easy to see that there is agreement with the discussion here: the authors of [10] nd
that the quartic coupling involving three s2 and a chiral primary in a higher kaluza-klein
level vanishes, which agrees with consistent truncation of type iib supergravity in ads5  s5.
therefore our ads calculation implies that the correlator htrx 4trx 2trx 2trx 2i has a free-
eld form for large g and large n. on the other hand, our perturbative result is valid for
any n and thus supports the idea of consistent truncation at the quantum level. further-
more, according to [6] the non-renormalization of next-to-extremal four-point functions is a
non-perturbative eect. hence we expect all the next-to-extremal quartic couplings in ads
supergravity to vanish, not just the simplest one discussed above. it would be interesting to
see whether this agrees with the results in [10]. this check requires making eld redenitions
as the ones carried out in [10] for the extremal case, and will be considered in future work.
moreover, our results suggest as a stronger conjecture that next-to-extremal couplings of n
elds have to vanish as well.

the consideration of instanton congurations provides further non-perturbative evidence
for the non-renormalization of next-to-extremal correlators. in [5], an instanton calculation

18

has been performed for extremal correlators. the non-perturbative non-renormalization of
extremal correlators was checked by computing the contribution from any instanton sector
at leading order in the semiclassical expansion. these contributions were proven to vanish
using both the systematics of gaugino zero-modes in the multi-instanton background [23]
and the fact that any extremal correlator of irreducible representations in the su(3)  u(1)
decomposition of su(4) is related by su(4) transformations to a correlator of the form
hzk1(x1)zk2(x2)   zkn(xn)i. in the next-to-extremal case considered here there are (n 1)(n
2)/2 invariant contractions of the avour indices. all the possible invariants are generated
by the set of correlators in which the rst operator is in a maximal weight representation:
hzk1(x1)(zk21z)(x2)zk3(x3)   zkn(xn)i, . . . , hzk1(x1)zk2(x2)   zkn1(xn1)(zkn1z)(xn)i, where
zki1z denotes a traceless symmetric tensor of su(3) built out of ki  1 elds z and one eld
z. in particular we may study correlation functions for maximal weight components in each
tensor, such as h(z1)k1(x1)((z1)k22 zz)(x2)(z1)k3(x3)   (z1)kn(xn)i. the multi-instanton con-
tribution to these correlators can be proven to vanish using an argument analogous to the
in n =4 sym a multi-instanton conguration has sixteen exact gaugino
one used in [5]:
zero-modes  a
 , corresponding to the eight supersymmetry and eight superconformal transfor-
mations broken by the instanton solution [24]. solving the equations of motion of the scalar
elds in the instanton background, one nds (to order g2) that the scalars are bilinear in the
zero-modes and that z1 (z1) contains zero-modes of avour 0 and 1 (2 and 3) only, where 0
refers to the spinor in the vector multiplet. on the other hand, the measure of integration
for the multi-instanton coordinates contains a factor d16. in order to get a non-vanishing
contribution, the rst operator in the correlation function must absorb at least six of the
eight zero-modes of type 0 and 1. hence, this operator must contain a factor of ()3. since
 is a two-component grassmann variable, ()m = 0 for any m  3 and this factor (and the
entire correlator) vanishes. this leads us to conclude that the next-to-extremal correlators do
not receive corrections from any multi-instanton sector at leading order in the semiclassical
expansion.

all these checks support the conjecture of [6] that next-to-extremal correlation functions of

an arbitrary number of chiral primary operators are not renormalized.
