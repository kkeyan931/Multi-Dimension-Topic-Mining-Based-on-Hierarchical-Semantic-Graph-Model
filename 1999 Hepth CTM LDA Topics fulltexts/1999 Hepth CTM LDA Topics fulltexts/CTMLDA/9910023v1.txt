abstract: we obtain an einstein metric of constant negative curvature given an arbi-
trary boundary metric in three dimensions, and a conformally at one given an arbitrary
conformally at boundary metric in other dimensions. in order to compute the on-shell
value of the gravitational action for these solutions, we propose to integrate the radial
coordinate from the boundary till a critical value where the bulk volume element vanishes.
the result, which is a functional of the boundary metric, provides a sector of the quantum
eective action common to all conformal eld theories that have a gravitational descrip-
tion. we verify that the so-dened boundary eective action is conformally invariant in
odd (boundary) dimensions and has the correct conformal anomaly in even (boundary)
dimensions. in three dimensions and for arbitrary static boundary metric the bulk metric
takes a rather simple form. we explicitly carry out the computation of the corresponding
eective action and nd that it equals the non-local polyakov action.

there is accumulating evidence that certain conformal eld theories (cft) have a

dual description in terms of string (or m) theory on anti-de sitter (ads) spaces [13].

this is a strong/weak coupling duality, so perturbative calculations on one side of the

correspondence yield strong coupling results on the other side. in particular, the strong

coupling limit of these cfts has a description in terms of supergravity theory.

certain aspects of the correspondence are rather universal and apply to all cases

that such a duality exists. for example, the leading in the large n contribution to

the weyl anomaly is universal [4]. more generally, (certain) correlation functions of the

energy momentum tensor at leading order can also be computed by using only the purely

gravitational part of the corresponding supergravity and are therefore universal.

to obtain this universal behavior one would need to solve einsteins equations with

arbitrary dirichlet boundary conditions (more precisely, one needs to determine an ein-

stein manifold of constant negative curvature given a conformal structure at innity).

this is a rather dicult problem whose solution in all generality has yet to be worked

out. an existence theorem for such einsteins metrics has been proved by graham and

lee [5] for manifolds xd+1 that are topologically a (d+1)-ball, so the boundary at innity

is a d-sphere sd, and conformal structures suciently close to the standard one. more-

over, one can explicitly obtain an asymptotic expansion of the bulk metric near innity

starting from any boundary metric [6, 4]. this information is sucient in order to obtain

the counterterms that render the eective action nite and the conformal anomaly [4].

however, it is not enough in order to obtain the nite on-shell value of the gravitational

action. for this one would need the full solution, not just its asymptotic expansion near

innity.

in this letter we obtain a three dimensional einstein metric of constant negative cur-

vature given any boundary metric and a (d+1)-dimensional (d > 2) conformally at

einstein metric with conformal structure at innity represented by an arbitrary confor-

mally at metric. in the latter case, had we picked the at metric as a representative

of the boundary conformal structure, our solution would reduce to the standard anti-de

sitter metric in poincare coordinates, so it is locally isometric to ads spacetime. the

2

interest in considering the solution with arbitrary conformally at metric in the boundary

stems from the fact that in the ads/cft correspondence the boundary metric becomes

a source for the boundary energy momentum tensor, and in quantum eld theory the

sources are arbitrary. to obtain the on-shell value of the gravitational action one still

has to know the global structure of the solutions. we shall not delve into this issue here.

nevertheless, we shall propose a general formula for the eective action, (23), and show

that it has the correct transformation properties under conformal transformations.

let xd+1 be a (d+1)-dimensional manifold with a boundary at innity md. given a

metric g(0) at md we seek for a solution of einsteins equations,

r

2

r g =  g,

(1)

such that g(0) is a representative of the conformal structure at innity. here  =  d(d1)
is the cosmological constant, and throughout this article hatted quantities refer to d+1

2l2

dimensional object. greek indices denote (d+1)-dimensional indices and latin indices

d-dimensional ones. the radial coordinate will be denoted by . we will work in the

coordinate system introduced by feerman and graham [6] where the bulk metric takes

the form

where

ds2 =

l2d2
42 +

1


gij(x, )dxidxj

,

g(x, ) = g(0) + g(2) + 2g(4) + . . .

.

(2)

(3)

equation (1) can be integrated exactly when the weyl tensor vanishes. this is always

true in three dimensions, so it imposes no further conditions.

in higher dimensions,

however, it implies that the bulk metric is conformally at. the weyl tensor in (d+1)

dimensions is equal to ( = {, i}, i = 0, ..., d  1)

w = r + ( p (d+1)



g + p (d+1)



g  p (d+1)



g  p (d+1)



g),

where

p (d+1)



( g) =

d  1   r 

r

g! .

(4)

(5)

when the weyl tensor vanishes the eld equations (1) become,

r =

1
l2 ( g g  g g).

(6)

this implies that the space is locally isometric to anti-de sitter space. in the coordinate

system (2), equation (6) becomes3

(7)

(8)

(9)

one can show that if (9) holds to all orders and (7) and (8) to lowest order, then

(7)-(8) hold to all orders. dierentiating (9) one obtains,

g = 0.

this means that the expansion in (3) terminates at 2. one can integrate (9),

g = (cid:18)1 +


2

g(2)g1

(0)(cid:19) g(0)(cid:18)1 +


2

g1

(0)g(2)(cid:19) .

(10)

(11)

therefore, to fully determine the metric we only need to know g(2). there are two cases

to consider: d = 2 and d > 2. we start from the latter. in this case one easily obtains

from (7),

where r(0)
ij

g(2) = l2p (d)

ij (g(0)) = l2

d  2  r(0)

2(d  1)

g(0)ij! ,

(12)

is the ricci tensor of the metric g(0) etc. from (7) and (4) we nd that the

weyl tensor of g(0) vanishes. in d > 3 this implies that g(0) is conformally at. in this case

bianchi identities imply that (8) is satised as well. in d = 3 the weyl tensor vanishes

identically. however, in this case the derivation of (8) through bianchis does not go

through. the tensor in the left hand side of (8) at  = 0 is the weyl-schouten tensor

(sometimes also called the cotton tensor). the vanishing of the latter is a neccesary

and sucient condition for conformal atness in three dimensions (see, for instance, [6]).

3our conventions are as follows rijk

l = ijk

l + ip

ljk

p  i  j and rij = rikj

k. with these

conventions the curvature of anti-de sitter space comes out positive, but we will still use the term

metric of constant negative curvature for anti-de sitter metrics.

4

thus, in d = 3, g(0) is required to be conformally at as well. to summarize, we have

shown that in d > 2 the metric (2) with g given by (11)-(12) is a conformally at solution

of einsteins equation, provided g(0) is also conformally at.

when d = 2 equation (7) only determines the trace,

from (8) we get

tr(g1

(0)g(2)) =

l2
2

r(0).

g(2)ij =

l2

2 (cid:16)r(0)g(0)ij + tij(cid:17) ,

where tij is a symmetric tensor that satises

itij = 0,

tr(g1

(0)t ) = r(0).

(13)

(14)

(15)

tij has three independent components and we have three equations. since (15) involves

a dierential equation the solution will in general be non-local in terms of covariant

expressions of g(0). one can restore covariance and locality by introducing an auxiliary

scalar , and integrate over it. tij then is the stress energy tensor of that scalar. from

the trace condition we see that  is the liouville eld. the action for the liouville theory

(with no potential) is

wl =

1

48 zx2

d2xg(0)(cid:18)1

2

gij

(0)ij + r(0)(cid:19)

(16)

the occurrence of the energy-momentum tensor of the liouville eld in g(2) has been

recently reported in [7]. the eld equation for  is

 = r(0).

(17)

integrating out  the action (16) reduces to the polyakov non-local eective action. the

stress energy tensor is given by

tij =

1
2ij + ij 

1
2

g(0)ij (cid:18)1

2

()2 + 2 (cid:19) .

(18)

one may check that the stress energy tensor satises (15), provided (17) is satised. one

could, more generally, consider the liouville eld with a potential v () = e. in this

case, however,  becomes interacting and it is no longer auxiliary. furthermore, one can

5

add to tij the energy-momentum tensor of arbitrary conformal matter (i.e. matter with

traceless, covariantly conserved energy momentum tensor).

according to the prescription in [2, 3] the eective action (or more properly, the gen-

erating functional of connected graphs) of the boundary theory is given by the on-shell

value of the action functional

s[ g] =

1

16g "zxd+1

dd+1xqdet g(cid:16) r + 2(cid:17) +zmd

ddxqdet g2k# ,

(19)

where k is the trace of the second fundamental form and g is the induced metric at the

boundary. the expression in (19), however, is infrared divergent. to regulate the theory

we cut-o the bulk integral to  >  for some cut-o  > 0 and evaluate the boundary

integral at  = . in [4] the divergences were calculated and shown that can be removed

by adding covariant counterterms. the focus here will be on the nite part. an important

issue is what is the range of the  coordinate. intuition from spaces that are topologically

a ball suggest to integrate from the boundary till the center of the ball. in the center of

the bulk, the bulk volume element should vanish. we therefore propose to integrate 

from  till cr(x), with cr(x) satisfying

det a(x, cr(x)) = 0,

(20)

where a2(x, ) = g1

(0)g. in the solutions we are considering here, a(x, ) is linear in ,

so det a is a polynomial of degree d, and (20) has d roots. it is an important question

which root one should pick. intuitively, one might expect that one should pick the smallest

positive cr(x) (recall that the boundary is at  = 0). furthermore, one could also demand

that the area of the surface  = cr(x) vanishes. this imposes conditions stronger than

(20). in the case the boundary metric is stationary, the latter condition is satised if the

bulk lapse and shift functions vanish at  = cr(x). in general, we expect the choice of the

root to also depend on global issues. leaving a detailed analysis for future study, we now

show that for any choice of root, the eective action so dened transforms correctly under

conformal transformation, i.e. it is conformally invariant when d is odd, and its conformal

transformation yields the weyl anomaly of the boundary theory when d is even.

the renormalized eective action, i.e. the on-shell value of (19) with the innities

6

cancelled by counterterms, is given by

wf in =

1

16g

d

l z ddxg(0)z cr(x)

d
d/2+1 det a(x, ) .

(21)

we now show that it has the correct transformation properties under conformal trans-

formations provided gij(x, ) is a power series in . the determinant of a(x, ) can be

presented as power series

det a(x, ) = xk

ak(x)l2kk ,

a0 = 1 ,

(22)

containing possibly innite number of terms. for the solution in (11), where the expansion

in  terminates at 2, a(x, ) is linear in , the sum in (22) is nite and in suciently

low dimensions one can explicitly obtain the roots of the equation det a(x, cr(x)) = 0.

feeding back in (21) one then obtains the eective action,

wf in =

cr



(x)l2kak(x) + a d

k  d

2

(x) ln cr(x)


,

(23)

where the last term appears only when d is even. this expression is in general non-analytic

in the curvatures. the starting point in the derivation of (23) was (19) which is the string

theory eective action to lowest order in derivatives. therefore, only the leading part in

derivatives of (23) can be reliably considered as the eective action of the dual conformal

eld theory.

from the form of the eld equation in (7)-(9) follows that in the expansion of the

metric,  is always accompanied by a factor of l2. then, by dimensional analysis the

coecients ak(x) in (22) contain 2k derivatives. it follows that under the innitesimal

conformal transformation g(0) = 2(x)g(0) they transform as

ak(x) = 2k(x)ak(x) + o((x)) .

(24)

using this transformation property we now compute the variation of the functional (23)

under a conformal variation of the boundary metric g(0). the variation of cr(x) in wf in

does not contribute as one sees from (21): the corresponding contribution is proportional

to det a(x, cr(x)) which vanishes due to the denition of cr. performing the remaining

7

variations we get for any d

(25)

cr(x)


+ ij i


where the term ij i comes from the terms proportional to a derivative of the  upon
partial integration. such contribution to the eective action can come from covariant

counterterms [4]. the opposite is also expected to be true, i.e. that all contributions
of the form ij i can be cancelled by covariant counterterms, although, to our knowl-
edge, this has not been shown in general. furthermore, these counterterms would be

higher derivative terms, and as we argued above our considerations are to leading order

in derivatives. with these caveats, we proceed by omitting these terms.

when d is odd, the terms inside the parenthesis in (25) are just equal to det a(x, )

evaluate at  = cr(x). hence, the variation (25) vanishes and the eective action is

conformally invariant. when d is even the innite sum in (25) reduces to single term

this results in the conformal anomaly

a =

(x) .

(26)

which coincides with the result in [4].

the eective action we have computed is, by the ads/cft correspondence, the ef-

fective action of some conformal eld theory at strong coupling. unless there is a non-

renormalization theorem, one does not expect this strong coupling result to agree with a

weak coupling computation (using, for instance, heat kernel methods) on the conformal

eld theory side. however, when d = 2 the eective action is determined, up to a constant

which is the central charge, from the conformal anomaly. since there is only one possible

conformal anomaly in d = 2 the eective action in weak and strong coupling can at most

dier by the value of the central charge at weak and strong coupling. therefore, for d = 2

the eective action in (23) should reduce to the polyakov action (or, at least, to an action

which is in the same universality class with the polyakov action). in higher dimensions,

8

one can similarly obtain the eective action up to conformally invariant terms by inte-

grating the conformal anomaly. since our boundary metric is conformally at, the result

is expected to be, up to higher derivative terms, equal to the eective action coming from

integrating the euler part of the conformal anomaly.

in the remaining we restrict ourselves to d = 2 and consider the case the boundary

metric g(0) is a general static metric,

ds2 = h(x)d 2 +

dx2
h(x)

,

(27)

for arbitrary h(x). this, for suitable h(x), can be the metric of any two dimensional

compact riemann surface since the latter can always be equipped with a metric of constant
scalar curvature. specically, for a sphere of radius a, h(x) = 1  x2/a2, for a torus,
h(x) = 1, and for a hyperbolic plane of radius a, h(x) = x2/a2  1. one can also consider
metrics describing non-compact spaces, such as the metric of a 2d schwarzschild black

hole, h(x) = 1a/x. the bulk metric is still a solution of einsteins equation, but one has
to be careful with what the boundary of spacetime is. since the two-dimensional slices

are non-compact the true boundary generically has components in all slices.

given the boundary metric in (27) one can explicitly integrate (17) once,

 = 

4j

0 =

h  b

h

(28)

where the prime indicates dierentiation with respect to x and j and b are integration

constants. g(2) is then given by a local expression in terms of h and its derivatives.

inserting in (11) we obtain

ds2 =

where b2 = b2  (4j/bl2)2. this metric is the most general metric of constant negative

and j.

consider the case h(x) has a single zero at some point x = x+. this can happen for

instance if the metric (27) describes a compact closed manifold with a topology of a sphere

9

(in which case it vanishes at two points), or if the metric describes a two dimensional black

hole. regularity of the euclidean two-dimensional metric requires that  is periodic with

period equal to the inverse hawking temperature, t 1

h = 4/h(x+). in this case, we nd

that in order for the bulk metric to be smooth, j should be equal to zero, and b = h(x+),

i.e. the integration constant b is related to the hawking temperature of the boundary

geometry. one further nds that the latter condition ensures that  is regular at x = x+.

if h(x) does not have a zero then j may be non-zero.

in particular, if the boundary

geometry is a torus, so h(x) = 1, the solution (29) is the rotating btz black hole solution

with mass and angular momentum given by mbt z = b/2 and jbt z = jl.

let us calculate the eective action in d = 2. in this case, the equation for the critical

value of , det a(x, ) = 0, gives a quadratic equation. the discriminant is equal to

 =

1

8 (cid:18)trt 2 

1
2

(trt )2(cid:19)

(30)

where t is the liouville energy momentum tensor. one may check that  is always

positive. it becomes a total square when either the diagonal elements of tij are equal

or the o-diagonal ones vanish. the latter happens when the boundary metric is static

and j = 0. in this case the results simplify, and, for simplicity, we only present this case

(although we have computed the eective action for general g(0)). we further choose the

root that yields zero area for the surface  = cr(x). this root can be determined by

demanding that g  vanishes at  = cr(x). the result is

cr(x) =

16
l2

h(x)

h2(x+)  h2(x)

.

(31)

the critical value cr(x) is positive provided h(x) < 0 and smaller than the second root

if h(x) > 0. in the following we restrict our attention to this case. the nite eective

action is then given by

wf in =

(32)

where we introduced c = 3l/2g, which is equal to the value of the central charge of the

strongly coupled cft.

we have argued above that this expression should be a multiple of the polyakov action

(16), with the multiplicity factor being the central charge of the strongly coupled cft.

10

to obtain the polyakov action we need to integrate (28) (with j = 0) once more, since

it is  that appears in (16). this involves a new integration constant. the latter can

be xed by choosing a reference manifold d2 on which the quantum state is the vacuum

state and demanding that d2 = 0 [8]. let us rst consider the case the 2d manifold is

non-compact, and put it on the box of size l. with the choice of reference manifold in

[8], we get

the result is

(34)

where x+ is the zero of h(x) and (x) satises (33). one may verify that wf in and

cwl dier only by boundary terms, and that the latter vanish for asymptotically at

boundary spacetimes in the large l limit (modulo terms independent of the boundary

geometry). the same calculation, yielding again agreement, can be done for the case of

spherical geometry by considering two coordinate patches. more generally, if wf in and

cwl only dier by boundary terms, one can achieve exact agreement by suitable choice

of the reference manifold.
