abstract

we investigate the relation between supersymmetry and geometry for
two dimensional sigma models with target spaces of arbitrary signature, and
lorentzian or euclidean world-sheets. in particular, we consider twisted forms
of the two-dimensional (p, q) supersymmetry algebra. superspace formula-
tions of the (p, q) heterotic sigma-models with twisted or untwisted supersym-
metry are given. for the twisted (2,1) and the pseudo-kahler sigma models,
we give extended superspace formulations.

1 introduction

in [1], the analysis of [2, 3, 4] on the geometry of (1,0) and (1,1) supersymmetric
sigma-models was generalised to the case in which the target space had arbitrary
signature, and the conditions for the theory to be invariant under extra supersym-
metries were investigated. covariantly constant complex structures, i.e. (1,1) ten-
sors j satisfying j 2 = 1, led to extra supersymmetries, each satisfying the usual
superalgebra q2  p , while covariantly constant real structures, i.e.
(1,1) ten-
sors s satisfying s2 = 1, led to extra twisted supersymmetries [1], each satisfying
the twisted superalgebra q2  p . the number of structures of either type de-
pended on the target space holonomy of a certain connection which had torsion if the
sigma-model had a wess-zumino term. for example, if the holonomy is contained
in usp(2m), there are three complex structures i, j, k satisfying the quaternion
algebra with su(2) commutation relations, while if the holonomy is contained in
sp(2m, r), there is one complex structure j and two real structures s, t satisfying
the pseudo-quaternion algebra with su(1, 1) commutation relations. the aim of
this paper is to give the superspace formulation of these models and to investigate
their structure further.

extended world-sheet supersymmetries have had two dierent uses in string the-
ory. in the study of heterotic or type ii strings, complex manifolds such as calabi-
yau spaces have played an important role. in these cases, the string theory only has
gauged (1,1) or (1,0) world-sheet supersymmetry, but the (1,1) or (1,0) sigma-model
on a suitable background can have extra rigid world-sheet supersymmetries; on a
kahler manifold, for example, n = 1 world-sheet supersymmmetry is extended to
n = 2, and n = 2 superconformal eld theory has played a central role in the
study of such compactications. there are also string theories in which an extended
world-sheet supersymmetry is gauged, such as those with n = 2 local world-sheet
supersymmetry, and in these a target space with either 4 euclidean dimensions, or
with 2 space and 2 time dimensions naturally arises. our results on general signa-
ture have applications to both heterotic or type ii strings in general signature [5, 6]
and to (2, p) strings in 2+2 dimensions [7, 8, 9].

in [5, 6], new string theories were found in which the 10-dimensional space-time
had arbitrary signature, and in some cases the world-sheet was lorentzian (signature
1+1), while in others it was euclidean (signature 2+0). all of these were linked to
the usual string theories with target space signature 9+1 and lorentzian world-
sheets by chains of dualities [5, 6]. the world-sheet formulation of these string
theories is a sigma-model with target space of the appropriate signature. target
spaces that admit extra supersymmetries play an important role in the study of
solutions of these theories, just as in the case of compactifying on euclidean signature
internal spaces.

another context in which non-lorentzian signature target spaces have played
a role is in n = 2 strings, or more generally in strings with (2, 0), (2, 1) or (2, 2)
world-sheet supersymmetry. in these theories, the target spaces had signature 2+2
(or 4+0), and the heterotic theories were reduced (via a null reduction) to ones with
signature 1+1 or 2+1. the (2,1) string is of particular interest. it was shown by

1

kutasov and martinec [10], and by the same authors with oloughlin [11], that
dierent vacua of the (2,1) superstring describe the d1-string or the d2-brane, and
via dualities these are linked to all usual types of ten-dimensional superstrings and
to the eleven-dimensional supermembrane [10, 11]. this led to the suggestion that
the (2,1) heterotic string may provide many of the degrees of freedom of m theory,
although this approach has so far only yielded specially symmetric points in the
moduli space of vacua of m theory [12, 13]. martinec [14, 15, 16] has proposed an
interpretation of the (2,1) string as describing the continuum limit of the matrix
model of m theory [17] with all spatial dimensions compactied.

the (2,1) heterotic string [9] has a four-dimensional target spacetime with sig-
nature (2,2) that is required to have an isometry generated by a null killing vector,
which must be gauged. in general there are obstructions to the gauging of a given
isometry [18, 19], and the isometry is required to be one for which these are absent.
for (2,2) signature, this null reduction yields either a space with signature (2,1)
(corresponding to a membrane worldvolume [10, 11]) or a space with signature (1,1)
(corresponding to a string worldsheet [10, 11]). the theory dened on a spacetime
with signature (2,2) before null reduction is a theory of self-dual gravity with torsion
coupled to self-dual yang-mills gauge elds [9]. the exact classical eective action
for the gravitational, antisymmetric tensor and gauge degrees of freedom was given
in [13] and derived independently in [1] using sigma-model techniques (see [12, 16]
for reviews). in ref. [20], this action was simplied using an auxiliary metric and
shown to be weyl invariant at the classical level in four dimensions. a dual form
of this action was found; in four dimensions, the dual geometry is self-dual gravity
without torsion coupled to a scalar eld.

the heterotic sigma-models which describe the target spaces of (2,1) strings have
been discussed in [2, 3, 4]. the geometry is hermitean with torsion and the eld
equations imply that the curvature with torsion is self-dual in four dimensions, or
satisies generalised self-duality equations in higher dimensions. the conditions un-
der which these models have isometry symmetries were analysed in ref. [18], while
the gauging of such isometries and the construction of manifestly (2,1) supersym-
metric gauged actions were discussed in [18, 19, 21, 22].

this paper is organised as follows. in section 2, we discuss untwisted and twisted
(p, q) supersymmetry in two dimensions and introduce a superspace for the general
(p, q) superalgebra. in section 3 we construct the corresponding two dimensional
non-linear sigma models on target spaces of general signature, and derive the geo-
metric conditions imposed by supersymmetry. in section 4, we give a superspace
formulation of the models with twisted (p, q) supersymmetry and discuss their isom-
etry symmetries. in section 5, we review the geometry and the extended superspace
formulation of the sigma model with the usual (2,1) supersymmetry. an extended
superspace formulation of the sigma model with twisted (2,1) supersymmetry is
given in section 6. in section 7 we discuss the various possible n = 2 sigma models
and in particular give superspace formulations of the pseudo-kahler sigma models
with or without torsion. we summarise the results in section 8, and close with some
remarks on a reformulation with double numbers.

2 superalgebras and superspaces

in two-dimensional minkowski space, the global supersymmetry algebra of type (p, q)
was dened in ref. [2]. there also exists a twisted form of this algebra [1] and the
general case is

nqi
+, qj
nqi
+, qj 

+o = 2ijp+,
o = 0,

nqi 

, qj 

o = 2i j 

p,

(1)

+, i = 1, . . . , p, are the p positive-chirality supersymmetry charges, qi 
where qi
,
i  = 1, . . . , q are the q negative-chirality charges and +, are chiral spinor indices;
our superspace conventions are as in [23]. the supercharges q are 1-component
majorana-weyl spinors which, in our conventions, are real, q
 = q. consider the
right-handed superalgebra generated by the qi
+. in the conventional (untwisted)
[2], ij = ij , while in the general case ij in (1) can be an
superalgebra of
arbitrary symmetric matrix. if invertible, it can be brought to the form

ij =   1u

0

0 1t !

(2)

with u + t = p. then qi
+ for i = 1, . . . , u are normal supersymmetries that square
to p+, while qi
+ for i = u + 1, . . . , p are twisted supersymmetries that square to
p+, and we refer to the superalgebra as being twisted. this can be generalised
further to allow non-invertible metrics

ij = 


1u

with v zeroes as well as u +1s and t 1s (t + u + v = p); there would then
+ for i = u + t + 1, . . . , p (i. e. q2 = 0). note
be v nilpotent supercharges qi
that for e.g. the twisted (2,0) algebra, the supercharges q
+ are each
nilpotent, (q)2 = 0, but they do not anti-commute with each other. it would be
interesting to study the cohomology associated with such nilpotent supercharges.
the discussion of the left-handed superalgebra generated by the qi
 is similar, and
there are corresponding expressions for i j  with p and q interchanged.

+  q2

+ = q1

the above can be extended further to allow central charges z ij  with

or vectorial charges x ij

 with

but this will not be discussed further here.

twisted superalgebras are possible in higher dimensions also; for instance the
ten-dimensional type ii* string theories related by timelike t-duality to the usual

(5)

type ii superstring theories have twisted iia or iib superalgebras in 10 dimen-
sions [5].

it is straightforward to introduce a superspace for the general (p, q) superalge-
bra (1). there are two real bosonic coordinates + = 1 + 2,  = 1  2,
p real positive-chirality fermi coordinates +
i and q real negative-chirality fermi
coordinates

for minkowski world-sheets, there are one-component majorana-weyl spinors,
but for euclidean signature there are no majorana-weyl spinors, so the analysis is
dierent. a dirac spinor

a =   +
 !

(9)

has two complex components . one can impose a majorana condition (+) = 
or a pseudo-majorana condition (+) = , or a weyl condition + = 0 or
 = 0; there are thus various types of minimal spinor with 2 real components, but
none with 1 component.

there are then various types of superalgebras in two euclidean dimensions.
there is a (p, q) algebra with p right-handed weyl supercharges with complex com-
+ and q left-handed weyl supercharges with complex components qi 
ponents qi
,
and the superalgebra is again (1), but with all charges complex, and p  p1  ip2.
for n majorana spinors qi
a, i = 1, . . . , n, the general algebra (without central
charges or extra vector charges) is

nqi

a, qj

bo = m ij p(c)ab + n ij p(3c)ab

(10)

where c is the two-dimensional charge conjugation matrix, the  are two-dimensional
dirac matrices, 3 = i01 and m ij , n ij are some symmetric matrices. the ma-
trix m ij can be taken to be diagonal with eigenvalues +1,1 and 0, as in (3).
this can be obtained from the (n, n) algebra with n left-handed and n right-
handed weyl supercharges by imposing the majorana condition (qi
, with
m ij = 1
2(ij  i j ). for pseudo-majorana supercharges,
the result is similar. the general (n, m, r, s) superalgebra with n majorana su-
percharges, m pseudo-majorana supercharges, r right-handed weyl supercharges

 for i = i  = 1, ..., n and the pseudo-majorana condition (qi

bra with p = n + m + r, q = n + m + s, by imposing the majorana condition
+) = qi 
(qi
for i = i  = n + 1, ..., m + n. thus all cases are contained in the euclidean (p, q)
algebra, and much of the analysis of the minkwoski (p, q) models carries over to
the euclidean (p, q) theories; in particular, the eulidean (p, q) superspace has two
complex bosonic coordinates  = 1  i2, p complex positive-chirality fermi
coordinates +
i , with supercharges and
derivatives again given by (6) and (7).

(p, q) sigma models with general target space
signature

we now turn to the construction of non-linear two dimensional sigma models with
twisted or untwisted (p, q) supersymmetry on target spaces of arbitrary signature.
it is convenient to rst consider the (1,1) supersymmetric sigma model with

superspace action [23]

s(1,1) = z d2d+d[gij() + bij()]d+idj,

(11)

where the i are superelds which can be viewed as coordinates on some d-dimensional
manifold m with metric gij and torsion 3-form h given by the curl of the antisym-
metric tensor bij,

hijk =

(12)

the action (11) is invariant under (1,1) supersymmetry, general coordinate transfor-
mations on the target manifold m and antisymmetric tensor gauge transformations

bij = [ij].

this model will be conformally invariant at one-loop if there is a function  such

that

(17)

we now seek the conditions on the target space geometry under which the (1,1)
superspace action (11) is invariant under extra supersymmetries, generalising the
analysis of [2, 3, 4, 24] to arbitrary signature and giving a superspace derivation
if there are p  1 right-handed and q  1 left-handed extra
of the results of [1].
supersymmetry transformations, then they must be of the form

i = rt i

for some tensors (t(+)r)i

if the supersymmetry transformations (18) are to satisfy a superalgebra, which may
be twisted or untwisted, then the matrices tr(+) and tr() must satisfy anticommu-
tation relations of the form

nt()r, t()so = 2rs,

for some metrics rs, rs.

(23)

the condition n (t ) = 0 implies that t is integrable, i.e. that a coordinate system
can be chosen in which it is constant. however, if there are several integrable such
tensors, it will usually not be possible to choose coordinates in which they are
simultaneously integrable.

if the above conditions are satised, then the supersymmetry transformations (18)

together with the manifest (1,1) supersymmetries satisfy the algebra (1) with

ij =   1

(24)

diagonalising rs, rs, we nd that each tensor t squares to either +1, 1 or 0;
those satisfying t 2 = 1 are complex structures while those satisfying t 2 = 1 are
sometimes referred to as real structures (as in [26, 27]) and sometimes as almost
product structures (as in [23]).

consider rst the case of the right-handed supersymmetries with the tensors
tr = t(+)r. each is hermitean, tij = tji, and covariantly constant with respect to
the connection (+), and so the p1 tensors tr must be singlets under the holonomy
group h of (+). we will restrict ourselves to the cases in which the holonomy is
irreducible. for signature (m, n), h is o(n, m), or a subgroup thereof, as the metric
with signature (m, n) is covariantly constant. there will be a covariantly constant
complex structure j, with j 2 = 1, if m, n are even, n = 2n1, m = 2n2, so that the
signature is (2n1, 2n2), and if h  u(n1, n2). if there are two covariantly constant
complex structures, i, j, then k = ij is a third covariantly constant complex
structure and the i, j, k satisfy the quaternion algebra

i 2 = j 2 = k 2 = 1,

ij = ji = k, jk = kj = i, ki = ik = j

(25)

with i, j, k satisfying so(3) commutation relations. this requires that the holon-
omy group is contained in usp(2m) for euclidean spaces of even complex dimension
n = 2m (where usp(2m) is compact, with the convention that usp(2) = su(2); we
use the denitions of groups and their non-compact forms given in [28]). for spaces
of signature (4n, 4m), this requires that the holonomy is contained in usp(2n, 2m)
(this is the subgroup of u(2n, 2m) preserving a symplectic structure).

for a real structure s satisfying s2 = 1, the hermiticity condition implies that the
metric, if it is to be non-degenerate, has to be of signature (m, m), and the holonomy
group has to be in gl(m, r). if there are two real structures, s, t with {s, t} = 0,
then j = st is a complex structure and j, s, t must satisfy the pseudo-quaternion
algebra

j 2 = 1, s2 = t 2 = 1,

st = t s = j, t j = jt = s, js = sj = t

(26)

with j, s, t satisfying so(2, 1) commutation relations, so that there is a pseudo-
quaternionic structure [26, 27]. similarly, if there is a complex structure j and
a real structure s with {s, j} = 0, then t = js is another real structure and
j, s, t again satisfy the pseudo-quaternion algebra (26). the existence of such a
covariantly constant pseudo-quaternionic structure requires that m is even, m = 2k,
and the holonomy is in sp(2k, r). if p > 4, the tensors t satisfy an octonion or
pseudo-octonion algebra and the holonomy must be trivial. similar results apply for
the left-handed supersymmetries, the number of which depends on the holonomy of
the connection ().

the currents

j()r =

2

t ij
()rij

(27)

generate left and right handed kac-moody algebras. the right-handed currents
j(+)r generate an ane so(2) or so(3) if there are p = 2 or p = 4 untwisted

7

supersymmetries, and an ane so(1, 1) if p = 2 and one of the supersymmetries is
twisted, and an ane so(2, 1) if p = 4 and two of the supersymmetries are twisted.
in the latter case, the so(2, 1) kac-moody algebra is part of a non-compact twisted
form of the (small) n = 4 superconformal algebra with global limit given by (1),
where ij is the o(2, 2) invariant metric [1].

in the special case in which the torsion vanishes, then (+) = () =  and
the number of left-handed supersymmetries is the same as the number of right-
handed supersymmetries, p = q. for (2, 2) untwisted supersymmetry the geometry
is kahler, for (4, 4) untwisted supersymmetry the geometry is hyper-kahler, while
for (2, 2) twisted supersymmetry we shall call the geometry pseudo-kahler, and
for (4, 4) twisted supersymmetry we shall call the geometry pseudo-hyper-kahler.
the pseudo-kahler geometry shares many of the features of kahler geometry; in
particular, the metric can in both cases be given in terms of a scalar potential, as
we shall see in section 6.

4 extended superspace and isometries

a superspace formulation of the models with twisted (p, q) supersymmetry can be
given in (p, q) superspace using a formalism which generalises that proposed by howe
and papadopoulos in [29, 30]. let

(, 

 , +

, 

 , +
 )

(28)

with  = 0, . . . , u,  = u + 1, . . . , p  1 and   = 0, . . . , v,   = v + 1, . . . , q  1
(1  u  p  1, 1  v  q  1) be the superspace coordinates. the nonvanishing
anticommutators of the at superspace derivatives d+ and d are

{d+, d+} = 2i+,
{d+, d+} = 2i+,

{d, d } = 2i ,
{d, d } = 2i  .

(29)

d+ and d anticommute with the supercharges q+ and q, while d+ and
d anticommute with q+ and q. the generalised (p, q) non-linear sigma
model is described by a supereld i which is a map from the (p, q) superspace to
m. the chirality constraints [29, 30]

dr+i = t i
dri = t i

(+)rjd0+j,
()rjd0j,

r = 1, . . . , p  1,
r = 1, . . . , q  1,

(30)

imply that the (p, q) supersymmetry transformation of either type generated by
(q+, q) and (q+, q) reduce to the transformations (18) on expanding into
(1,1) superelds.

the twisted or untwisted (p, q)-supersymmetric sigma model action in the cor-

responding (p, q) superspace is then [29, 30]

s = i(cid:20)z d2d+

0 d

0 gijd0+id0j +z d2dtd+

0 d

0 hijktd0+jd0k(cid:21) ,

8

(31)

where the (p, q) superelds satisfy the constraints (30). if eqs. (19) and (20) hold,
then using the constraints (30) it can be shown that the action (31) is independent
of the extra supercoordinates (r, r), and as a result is invariant (up to surface
terms) under the non-manifest supersymmetries generated by (qr+, qr) and (qr+,
qr).

now consider (p, q) innitesimal superspace transformations of the form

i = ai

a()

(32)

with constant parameters a. these will constitute proper symmetries of the sigma
model action (31) if the metric and torsion are lie invariant,

and if in addition

(lag)ij = 0,

(lah)ijk = 0,

lat(+)r = lat()r = 0,

(33)

(34)

i. e. the real or complex structures are also lie invariant. then the i
a are killing
vectors which are holomorphic with respect to each complex structure, or holomor-
phic in a generalised sense with respect to each real structure. this implies locally
on m that

i
ahijk = 2[juk]a,

(35)

where u is a locally dened one-form uia which is determined in every coordinate
patch of m up to an exact lie-algebra valued one-form. it follows that there are
generalised killing potentials x(+)ra, x()ra satisfying

gijj

a + uia = t j

(+)rijx(+)ra = t j

()rijx()ra

(36)

for every r = 1, . . . , p  1 and r = 1, . . . , q  1.

5 (2,1) sigma models

in this section we review the (2,1) sigma model with untwisted supersymmetry; the
model with twisted (2,1) supersymmetry will be discussed in section 6. the geomet-
ric conditions for the (1,1) model to have untwisted (2,1) world-sheet supersymmetry
were rst obtained in refs. [2], and follow from the general discussion given above.
the manifold must be complex (with dimension d = 2n) with metric gij of signa-
ture (2m1, 2m2) with m1 + m2 = n and a complex structure j i
j which is covariantly
constant with respect to the connection with torsion (+) dened in (15) and with
respect to which the metric is hermitean, so that jij = gikj k
j is antisymmetric.

h = i(cid:16)  (cid:17) j.

the exterior derivative decomposes in the complex coordinate system as d =  + ,
so the closure of the three-form h implies

it follows that locally a (1,0) form k = kdz exists such that

ij = 0.

the metric and torsion potential are then given (in a suitable gauge) by

j = i(cid:16)k + k(cid:17) .

g = k + k
b = k  k.

(40)

(41)

(42)

if k = k for some k then the torsion vanishes and the manifold is kahler with
kahler potential k and the (2,1) supersymmetric model in fact has (2,2) supersym-
metry, but if dk 6= 0, then m is a hermitean manifold with torsion [2]. the metric
and torsion are invariant under [18]

k = i + 

(43)

where  is real and  is holomorphic,  = 0, but b as dened in (42) transforms
as

b = 2i,

(44)

which is an antisymmetric gauge transformation (13) with parameter  = 2i.
much of the above structure can be found using superspace methods. we start
by seeking the most general (2,1) supersymmetric sigma-model that can be written
in a (2,1) superspace parametrised by , +, 
, , where + = 1 + i2 is a
complex weyl spinor and the corresponding supercovariant derivatives are

+

d+ =

d =

so that

+, d+ =

+


+ + i

 + i,





+ + i++,

{d+, d+} = 2i+,

{d+, d} = {d+, d} = 0.

we introduce complex (2,1) scalar superelds ,  = () satisfying the chiral
constraint

d+ = 0, d+ = 0.

(47)

10

(45)

(46)

the lowest components |=0 = z of the superelds are bosonic complex coordi-
nates of the target space. the general sigma-model action is [31]

s = iz d2d+

+

d(cid:16)kd  kd(cid:17)

(48)

for some local vector potentials k(, ), k(, ), which are required to be
complex conjugate if the action (48) is to be real, k = (k). expanding in com-
ponents, the bosonic part of the action is a bosonic sigma-model with metric g
and torsion potential b given in terms of k by (42), so that we nd the geometry
described above. in particular, if k = k for some scalar k, then the torsion
vanishes and the metric is given by

g = k

(49)

so it is kahler.

the additional geometric conditions under which the model has isometry sym-
metries have been analysed in ref. [18]. there it was shown that the geometry
determines the potentials  and  that appear in eq. (43). the construction of
gauged (2,1) superspace actions was discussed in refs. [18, 19, 21].

note that cij is a representative of the rst chern class, and that it can be written
as c (+)
if the metric has euclidean
signature, the holonomy of any metric connection (including ()) is contained in
o(2n), while if it has signature (2m1, 2m2) with m1 + m2 = n, it will be contained
in o(2m1, 2m2). as the complex structure is covariantly constant, the holonomy
h((+)) of the connection with torsion (+) is contained in u(m1, m2), but it will
be contained in su(m1, m2) if in addition c (+)
ij = 0; a necessary condition for this
is the vanishing of the rst chern class.

it was shown in [32, 4, 24] that geometries for which

(+)
i = 0

(53)

in some suitable choice of coordinate system will satisfy the conditions for one-loop
conformal invariance (14) provided the dilaton is chosen as

 =

log | det g|,

11

(54)

which implies

i = vi.

(55)

moreover, the one-loop dilaton eld equation is also satised for compact manifolds,
or for non-compact ones in which  falls o suciently fast [1]. this implies
that h((+)) is contained in su(m1, m2). these geometries generalise the kahler
ricci-at or calabi-yau geometries, and reduce to these in the special case in which
h = 0. however they are not the most general solutions of the conditions (14) [1].
the condition that the connection (+) has su(m1, m2) holonomy can be cast

as a generalised self-duality condition on the curvature. dening the four-form

ijkl  3j [ijj kl],

for d = 4, ijkl = ijkl and this is the usual anti-self-duality condition.
can be obtained by varying the action [13, 12, 1]

the equation (53) can be viewed as a eld equation for the potential k, and

where g is given in terms of k by (42). this action can be rewritten as

s = z ddxq| det g|,

s = z ddx| det gij|1/4

(58)

(59)

which is non-covariant but is invariant under volume-preserving dieomorphisms.
this can be rewritten in the classically equivalent alternative form [20]

s  = t 

4z ddx||1/4hijgij  (d  4)ci ,

(60)

where ij is an auxiliary metric,  = det ij and c, t 
4 are (real) constants. in the
special case of four dimensions, the constant term in the action (60) vanishes and
there is a generalised weyl symmetry under

ij  (x)ij.

(61)

the dualisation of the action (58) was discussed in ref. [20]. this is achieved
by adding a lagrange multiplier term imposing the constraint g = k + k.
the vector potentials k, k are then lagrange multipliers for a certain constraint,
and solving this leads to a dual form of the action [20].
in four dimensions, the
dual geometry is self-dual gravity without torsion coupled to a scalar eld, while in
d > 4 dimensions the dual geometry is hermitean and determined by a d  4 form
potential k which generalises the kahler potential of the four-dimensional case. the
coupling to the yang-mills elds is through a term k  tr(f  f ) and leads to a
uhlenbeck-yau eld equation j ijfij = 0 [20].

6 twisted (2,1) sigma models

consider now the case of space-time signature (d, d), which was called kleinian in
ref. [27]. we start by considering the (2,1) superspace formulation to obtain the ge-
ometry in a special coordinate system (the analogue of the complex coordinates of
section 5), then show how the same results can be obtained in a coordinate indepen-
dent manner using the results of section 3. using the (2,1) superspace introduced
in section 2, we dene

(66)

and the supercharges

+ = 1

+, + = 1

q+ =

q+ =

satisfying the algebra

{q+, q+} = 2+, q2

together with the superderivatives

d+ =



+ + + 
+ ,

d+ =


 +

+ + 

+ ,

which satisfy the anticommutators

{d+, d+} = n d+, d+o = 0
nd+, d+o = 2+.

thus the structure associated with +, + in the twisted (2,1) case is similar to that
associated with +, + in the untwisted (2,1) case, with the important dierence
that in the usual case +, + are complex and related by (+) = +, while in the
twisted case +, + are independent real coordinates.

the twisted (2,1) supersymmetric sigma-model can be formulated in a twisted
(2,1) extended superspace as follows. first we introduce chiral scalar superelds u 
and v  satisfying

d+u  = 0, d+ v  = 0.

(67)
note that as d+, d+ are independent real derivatives, we take u , v  as independent
real superelds. here  = 1, ...., n and  = 1, ...., n for some n, n. the general
twisted superspace action is

s = z d2d+d+d(cid:16)kdu   k d v (cid:17)

(68)

for some independent real vector potentials k(u , v ), k (u , v ). the corre-
sponding lagrangian in (1,1) superspace can be obtained by integrating over +
2 .
up to a total derivative term, we nd the action

s = z d2d+

1 d[g  + b ]d1+udv ,

(69)

13

where u, v are the lowest components of the superelds u and v . the metric and
torsion potential are given by

g  = k  +  k
k    k.
b  = 
with g = b = 0. the target space line-element is


ds2 = 2g (u, v)dudv

(70)

(71)

(72)

so that /u and /v  are null vectors.
if n 6= n, the metric constructed in
this way is degenerate in general; we will not consider this case further and restrict
ourselves to the case n = n.

the condition for the torsion to vanish is

k = ,

k  =   

(73)

for some locally dened potentials , . if this is satised, then the metric is given
in terms of a scalar potential k =   ,

g  =

2

uv 

k,

(74)

giving a real-structure analogue of kahler geometry, pseudo-kahler geometry.

the same geometry can be obtained using the results of section 3 as follows. the
(1,1) sigma models with target space signature (n, n) and a covariantly constant real
structure s will have twisted (2,1) supersymmetry with global limit given by the
supersymmetry algebra (1), where i, j = 1, 2 and ij = diag(1,1). the holonomy
is h((+))  gl(n, r). the integrable real structure s squares to +1,

si

j = +i

(75)

twisted (2,1) supersymmetry requires si
to the connection with torsion (+),

j to be covariantly constant with respect

and to be antisymmetric

(+)
k si

j = 0

sij = sji.

(76)

(77)

as si

j is integrable (i.e. its nijenhuis tensor (23) vanishes), there is a coordinate
system in which it is constant and diagonal. choosing such adapted real coordinates
u, v  ( = 1, 2;  = 1, 2), the real structure takes the form

si

j =

 ! .

the fundamental two-form is then

s =

1
2

sijdi  dj = g du  dv ,

14

(78)

(79)

and the line element takes the form (72), so that /u and /v  are null vectors.
any n-form can be decomposed into a set of (r, s) forms with r factors of du and
s factors of dv with r + s = n. the exterior derivative decomposes as d = u + v
where u : h (r,s)  h (r+1,s) and v : h (r,s)  h (r,s+1).
consider rst the case in which there is no torsion, h = 0. then the con-
ditions (76) and (77) imply that the geometry is given in terms of some locally
dened scalar potential k, and the metric takes the form (74) in adapted coordi-
nates; the sigma model with this geometry will be considered further in the next
section.

if h 6= 0, then the conditions (76) and (77) imply that the torsion three-form is

given in terms of the fundamental two-form (79) by

the condition dh = 0 then implies

h = (u  v) s.

uvs = 0

(80)

(81)

so that locally there is a (1,0) form k = kdu and a (0,1) form k = k dv  such that

s = u

k + vk.

(82)

the potentials k, k are independent real 1-forms. the metric and torsion potential
are given, in a suitable gauge, by eq. (71), so that

if the condition (73) holds for some locally dened potentials , , then the torsion
vanishes and

h = uv(cid:16)k + k(cid:17) .

(83)

(84)
so that (74) is satised with potential k =   . we thus recover the results
obtained from extended superspace; the extended superspace appproach gives the
general solution to the geometric constraints immediately, without having to inte-
grate dierential equations.

s = uv (  ) ,

if h = 0, then the curvature two-form is a (1,1) form and the only non-vanishing
it follows that the ricci tensor r  is

components of the curvature are r  .
proportional to c  and is given by

r  =   log | det g |

(85)

with r = 0. thus the einstein equation rij = 0 is equivalent to demanding
sl(d, r) holonomy and gives, with a suitable choice of coordinates,

which is a monge-amp`ere equation for k,

| det g | = 1

ij = 0.
if h 6= 0, the condition (53) of the complex case is replaced by

(+)
i = 0

(92)

and this implies that the one-loop eld equation (14) is satised, provided the dilaton
is chosen as in (54). furthermore, the condition (92) implies c (+)
ij = 0 and so the
holonomy is in sl(n, r).

the eld equation (92) can be obtained from the action (59), but where now
the metric is given by (70) in terms of the potentials k, k corresponding to the real
structure s, and it is these that are varied to give the eld equation (92).

the real 1-form potentials k, k can be dualised in the same way as in the complex
case to obtain a new form of the dual action as well as the dual of the real geometry

for some scalar . thus the dual geometry in four dimensions is a real form of self-
dual gravity without torsion determined by the potential k coupled to the harmonic

7 (2,2) supersymmetric sigma models

if the (2,2) supersymmetry closes o-shell, the sigma-model can be formulated in
terms of o-shell (2,2) superelds. for the usual untwisted (2,2) supersymmetry, we
introduce the complex superspace coordinates z ( = 1, . . . , d1), +,  together
with the supersymmetry generators and supercovariant derivatives

(101)

or twisted chiral superelds v i, v j (i, j = 1, . . . d2) satisfying the constraints

d+v i = 0, dv i = 0, dv j = 0, d+v j = 0.

(102)

the action for the kahler sigma model is

s = z d2d4k(u, u),

(103)

where k is the kahler potential, so that the metric is given by eq. (49). the action
and metric are invariant under the kahler gauge transformations

complex dimension d1 + d2 with coordinates x = (u, u, v, v), where u, u, v and v
are the lowest components of the supeelds u, u, v and v . the action (105) is
invariant under generalised kahler gauge transformations

k = f1(u, v ) + f2(u, v ) + f 1(u , v ) + f 2(u , v ).

(106)

the bosonic part of the component sigma model action is

s =

where the metric g and the torsion potential b are given by

(107)

(108)

all other components of g and b not related to these by complex conjugation
or symmetry vanish, and k... denotes the partial derivative  . . . k. the
geometry is that of a hermitean locally product space with two commuting complex
structures j ()
. in the special case in which either d1 = 0 or d2 = 0, the torsion
vanishes and the target space is kahler.



for twisted (2,2) supersymmetry with the superalgebra (1), we introduce the
real superspace coordinates z, +, +, ,  together with the supersymmetry
generators and supercovariant derivatives

the pseudo-kahler sigma model action is then

mations

(114)

the action

dimension 2(d1 + d2) with coordinates x = (u, u, v, v), where u, u, v and v are the
lowest components of the supeelds u, u , v and v . the action (115) is invariant
under generalised pseudo-kahler gauge transformations

k = f1(u, v ) + f2(u, v ) + f1( u , v ) + f2( u , v ).

(116)

the bosonic part of the component sigma model action is again given by (107),

where the metric g and the torsion potential b are given by

g  = k ,
bj = kj,

gij = kij
bi  = ki .

(117)

all other components of g and b not related to these by real conjugation or
symmetry vanish. the geometry is that of a real locally product space with two
commuting real structures s()
; see [23] for details. in the special case in which
either d1 = 0 or d2 = 0, the torsion vanishes and the target space is pseudo-kahler.
the metrics and torsion potentials (49), (108) and (117) will dene consistent
string backgrounds if the corresponding sigma-model is conformally invariant. for
the kahler model, this will be the case if the metric is ricci-at or equivalently if
the curvature is self-dual (or anti-self-dual), i. e.



 r =

1
2



 r  = r.

(118)

there are also generalisations of these self-dual solutions to the condition for one-
loop conformal invariance with non-trivial dilaton, some of which were discussed in
ref. [22].

the sigma model with action (105) was shown in [4] to be one-loop conformally

invariant provided the u(1) parts of the two curvature tensors r()

 vanish,

c ()

 = 0,

(119)

so that both connections () have su(d1 + d2) holonomy and the rst chern class
vanishes; see [33] for a discussion of higher loops. for the twisted case with ac-
tion (105), the condition for one-loop conformal invariance is that both connections
() have su(d1, d2) holonomy.

19

similarly, for the pseudo-kahler sigma model with action (115), one-loop con-
formal invariance will hold provided the gl(1, r) parts of the the two curvature
tensors (dened as in eq. (90)) vanish,

c ()

 = 0.

(120)

if this condition holds, then both connections () will have sl(d1+d2, r) holonomy.
in refs. [35, 36], it was argued that all sigma-models with the usual (2,2) super-
symmetry can be formulated in superspace using chiral, twisted chiral and semi-
chiral [37] superelds. semi-chiral superelds have twice as many components as
chiral or twisted chiral ones, half of which are auxiliary. here we note that a real
analogue of the semi-chirality condition can be imposed, viz.

d+w  = 0,

d+ w

 = 0, d xj = 0,

d xj = 0.

(121)

this leads to a straightforward generalisation of many of the results of [35, 36] to
twisted (2,2) supersymmetric theories.

8 summary and discussion

to summarise, the usual supersymmetry algebra of type (p, q) can be generalised
to include the possibility of twisted heterotic supersymmetry, as in (1) and (2), and
a superspace for this can be dened. the geometry of the heterotic sigma models
which realise this algebra is a generalisation of kahler geometry with torsion, or a
further generalisation involving real structures squaring to +1.

a superspace formulation of the supersymmetric nonlinear sigma models with
untwisted or twisted (p, q) supersymmetry was given in section 3 in a formalism
in which (1,1) supersymmetry is manifest. for such sigma models, more general
isometries of the form (32) can be considered, where the vectors a are killing vectors
which are holomorphic with respect to each complex structure, or holomorphic in a
generalised sense with respect to each real structure. the gauging of such isometries
can be obtained from a straightforward extension of the results of refs. [29, 30, 34].
the results concerning the amount and type of supersymmetry that can be
realised can be summarised in terms of the holonomy group of the connection with
torsion. the various possibilities, which depend on the signature of the target space,
are listed in table 1.

the relation of right-handed supersymmetry to the holonomy of the
connection with torsion (+). we give the type of target space geometry
for the case in which the torsion vanishes.

for example, in the case of target spaces of kleinian signature (d, d) with a
single real structure, the holonomy group is contained in gl(d, r) and the model
has twisted (2,1) supersymmetry. the geometry generalises that of the usual (2,1)
sigma model:
in particular, the metric and torsion potential are given by (70),
(71) where k and k are independent real forms. this model can be formulated in
superspace as shown in section 6. sigma models with untwisted or twisted n = 2
supersymmetry can also be formulated in superspace, and this leads to new pseudo-
kahler (without torsion) and twisted pseudo-kahler (with torsion) sigma models
whose geometry is determined by a scalar potential analogous to the twisted kahler
potential of ref. [23]. if the torsion vanishes, then the twisted (2,1) supersymmetric
model reduces to the pseudo-kahler model. these real models are listed in table 2.

it is remarkable how much of the geometry based on a complex structure j
carries over to the case of a real structure s. instead of using complex numbers, it
is useful to introduce double numbers in this context [27]. these are based on a real
unit e which satises

e2 = +1

(122)
instead of the usual imaginary unit i satisfying i2 = 1. it is useful to dene a real
conjugation taking e  e, so that (x + ey) = x  ey for real numbers x, y.
for example, consider the formulation of the twisted (2,1) sigma model of sec-
tion 6 using double numbers. the real structure si

j takes the form

if the twisted (2,1) superspace action (128) is required to be real self-conjugate

with respect to the conjugation e  e = e, i. e. if

s = s ,

then we nd that the potentials k and k are real conjugates,

k = k.

this is the generalisation to the double numbers of the reality condition

s = s 

(130)

(131)

(132)

on the action (48), which implies that k = (k); in turn, this implies hermicity of
the metric and antihermicity of the torsion potential given in (42). for the general
models we have discussed, the condition (132) does not hold, the potentials k and
k are independent and the action is not real self-conjugate.

setting e = 1, the formulations of previous sections are recovered, but intro-
ducing e is a useful book-keeping device. in particular, it leads to the introduction
of the real conjugation operation, and makes the structure similar to that of the
complex case.
