abstract

we show in a precise group theoretical fashion how the generating solution of
bps regular black holes in n = 8 supergravity, which is known to be a solution also
of a simpler n = 2 st u model truncation, can be characterized as purely nsns
or rr charged according to the way the corresponding st u model is embedded
in the original n = 8 theory. in particular, one of these embeddings yields regular
bps black hole solutions carrying rr charge whose microscopic description can
be given in terms of bound states of dbranes only (pure rr congurations).
within this embedding we will consider, as an explicit example, a four parameters
solution for which we give both the full macroscopic and microscopic descriptions.

1 introduction

after the discovery of dbranes [1], there have been successful microscopic computations
for the entropy of some extremal and nonextremal black hole congurations which re-
produced, at the microscopic level, the expected beckensteinhawking behaviour [2]-[6].
however, despite these encouraging results, an open problem, nowadays, is still to nd
a general recipe to give this correspondence based on rst principles other than specic
computations. actually, while gravity seems to describe the quantum properties of all
black holes in a unied but incomplete way, string theory seems to give nice answers but
loosing the unied character of the properties of dierent black holes. actually it would
be necessary to nd a microscopic but still unied way of describing black hole physics
in the context of string theory.
in the last two years there have been in fact various
attempts, especially within the ads/cf t correspondence [7], to give an answer to this
question relying on some unifying principles but a denite answer has not been found,
yet. for recent progress in this direction see for example [8]-[14].

a complementary strategy, which could be helpful in this respect, is to take advantage
of the uduality properties of the black holes (like for instance the invariance of the
entropy under uduality transformations) and use them to infer the common underlined
structure of very dierent black holes sharing the same entropy. in particular, if one is able
to give a precise correspondence between at least one macroscopic solution (ultimately the
5 parameters generating one) and its microscopic description, and is really able to act on it
via duality transformations in a precise and explicit way, one could derive the microscopic
stringy description of any macroscopic solution. even of those solutions (as the pure
nsns ones) for which a microscopic entropy counting has not been achieved, yet. in our
opinion, the possibility of having a control, both at macroscopic and microscopic level, on
all regular black holes with a given entropy could shed further light on the very conceptual
basis of the microscopic entropy within string theory. this is the spirit this paper relies
on.

some time ago it has been shown that the generating solution of regular n = 8 black
holes can be characterized as a solution within the st u model [15]. such a model is a
n = 2 truncation of the n = 8 original theory [16]. any regular bps black hole solution
within this model is a 1/2 bps soliton of the n = 2 theory but, from the original n = 8
point of view, it is in fact a 1/8 supersymmetry preserving one (as any other regular bps
black hole solution should be: indeed the 1/2 and 1/4 solutions of n = 8 supergravity have
vanishing entropy [17]). this important result enables one to concentrate on the rather
simple structure of the st u model, then generating more general (and complicated)

1

solutions by uduality transformations. without specication of the proper embedding
in the mother n = 8 theory these st u model solutions can be nsns, rr or of a mixed
nature. this distinction, from the 4 dimensional point of view, relies on the identication
of the relevant (dimensionally reduced) 10 dimensional elds which enter dynamically in
the solution. in particular, a pure rr solution is one whose unique nsns eld present
is the metric tensor gm n but all other elds are rr. this case is particularly interesting,
this being the setting where a macroscopic/microscopic correspondence is more suitable:
indeed the microscopic interpretation of the solution can be given in terms of a bound
state of dbranes without any ns-brane or kk states.

actually, it is the algebraic characterization of scalars and vector elds which identies
the microscopic nature of a given solution. the aim of this paper is to dene two dierent
classes of embeddings (modulo s, t duality transformations) of the st u model within
the n = 8 theory, in order for its solutions (and in particular the generating solution)
to be nsns and rr charged, respectively. in particular we shall consider a specic
embedding yielding a pure rr solution.

although our main concern in this paper is the geometrical characterization of the
st u models with dierent microscopic eld content, in section 3 we will consider, as
an explicit example, a four parameters solution of the st u model, which can be easily
characterized, at the microscopic level, in terms of a bound state of d4 and d0 branes.
the relation between macroscopic and microscopic parameters will be particularly simple
and immediate.

2 the microscopic nature of the st u model

the 10 dimensional interpretation of the elds characterizing the solution depends on the
embedding of the st u model inside the n = 8 theory. a powerful tool for a detailed
study of these embeddings is based on the socalled solvable lie algebra (sla) approach.
in the following we summarize the main features of this formalism while we refer to [18]
for a complete review on the subject.

the solvable lie algebra technique consists in dening a one to one correspondence
between the scalar elds spanning a riemannian homogeneous (symmetric) scalar man-
ifold of the form m = g/h (g being a noncompact semisimple lie group and h its
maximal compact subgroup) and the generators of the solvable subalgebra solv of the
isometry algebra g dened by the well known iwasawa decomposition:

g = h  solv

2

(2.1)

where h is the compact algebra generating h. a lie algebra gs is solvable if for some
integer n  1, its nth order derived algebra vanishes:

d(n)gs = 0
dg(1)

s  [gs, gs]

where

; d(k+1)gs  [d(k)gs,d(k)gs]

since the 70dimensional scalar manifold mscal of n = 8 supergravity has the above
coset structure with g = e7(7) and h = su(8) it can be globally described as the group
manifold generated by a solvable lie algebra solv7, whose parameters are the scalar elds
i:

solv7 = {ti}

i  ti

i = 1, . . . , 70

the solvable group generated by solv7 acts transitively on mscal. considering the n =
8, d = 4 theory as the dimensional reduction on a torus t 6 of type iia or iib supergravity
theories in d = 10, the solvable characterization of the nsns and rr scalars in the
four dimensional theory was worked out in [19, 20] and is achieved by decomposing the
solvable algebra solv7 with respect to the solvable algebra solvt + solvs, where solvt
generates the moduli space of the torus mt = so(6, 6)/so(6)  so(6) (t = so(6, 6)
being the classical t duality group), and solvs generates the two dimensional manifold
sl(2, ir)/so(2) spanned by the dilaton  and the axion b (s = sl(2, ir) being the
sduality group of the classical theory). since in the formalism outlined above solvt is
naturally parameterized by the moduli scalars gij, bij (i, j denoting the directions inside
the torus), and solvs by  and b, the complement of solvt + solvs inside solv7 is a
nilpotent 32dimensional subalgebra parameterized by the 32 rr scalars. the general
structure of the solvable algebra dened by the decomposition (2.1) is the direct sum of
a subspace of the cartan subalgebra csa and the nilpotent space spanned by the shift
operators corresponding to roots whose restriction to this cartan subspace is positive:

solv = ck  x+{e}

(2.2)

ck is the noncompact part of the csa and + is the space of those roots which are
positive (non vanishing) with respect to ck.

in the case of the n = 8 theory in d = 4, solv is generated by the generators of the
whole cartan subalgebra of e7(7) (the algebra generating the group e7(7), whose cartan
generators are noncompact) and all the shift operators corresponding to the positive roots
of the same algebra. the cartan generators correspond to the radii of the internal torus
gii plus the dilaton , the positive roots correspond to the remaining t6 moduli and enter

3

the structure of solvt while the shift operators corresponding to the positive spinorial
roots of the so(6, 6) t duality group are naturally parameterized by the rr scalars.
the precise correspondence between the positive roots of e7(7) and type iia and type iib
elds is summarized in table 2. although this correspondence is xed by the geometry,
in what follows we shall dene algebraically two dierent classes of embeddings of the
st u model within the n = 8 theory which describe nsns or rr charged solutions
respectively. the embeddings within each class are related by an st conjugation which
preserves, as a general property, the nsns and rr nature of the elds .

let us recall the main concepts on how to dene the embedding of the st u from the
reduction of the central charge matrix zab of the n = 8 theory to its skew diagonal form,
z n . the latter procedure is a su(8) gauge xing which can be dened by setting all o
diagonal entries of zab to zero, except the skew-diagonal ones, by means of a suitable
48parameter su(8) transformation. the result is the central charge in its normal form:

z n =



z1  0

z3  0

z4 



,

1 0 

(2.3)

this gauge xing corresponds to a 48parameter uduality transformation on the 56
quantized charges ~q = (p, q) and 54 scalar elds in the expression of the central charge
such that the four skeweigenvalues of the central charge will depend nally only on 8
quantized magnetic and electric charges ~qn = (pn , qn ) (the normal form for the quan-
tized charges) and on 6 scalar elds which dene the vector and the scalar content of
the st u model describing the generating solution. the scalar manifold of this n = 2
truncation is:

so(2) #3
mst u = " sl(2, ir)

(2.4)

the centralizer of ~qn , which is dened as the maximal subgroup gc of e7(7) such that
gc  ~qn = ~qn , is so(4, 4) while the centralizer hc of z n is so(4)2, maximal compact
subgroup of gc. on the other hand the normalizer gn of ~qn , which is dened as the
subgroup of e7(7) that commutes with the centralizer, [gn , gc] = 0, is the isometry
group of mst u , [sl(2, ir)]3, while its isotropy group [so(2)]3 is the normalizer hn of
z n . given the central charge in its normal form, gn and gc are then xed within e7(7)
and therefore also the embedding of the nal st u model, mst u being given by gn /hn .
the scalar content of the latter model, in terms of the n = 8 scalars, is dened by

4

embedding solv(mst u ) into solv7, ~qn dene the quantized charges of the model, while
as usual the real and imaginary parts of the skew eigenvalues zk of the central charge
dene the physical dressed electric and magnetic charges of the interacting n = 2 model.
the above dened procedure of reduction of the central charge to its normal form,
when applied to zab in dierent bases, yields skew eigenvalues depending on the scalar
and charge content of st u models embedded dierently inside the original theory (the
algebras gn and gc  e7(7), generating gn and gc, would in general depend on the
original basis of zab). as we are going to explain in the following subsections there are
essentially two physically dierent classes dened by this embedding.

2.1 the nsns st u model

let us consider the central charge matrix in a basis z a b in which the index a of the 8 of
su(8) splits in the following way: a = (a = 1, . . . , 4; a = 1 . . . , 4), where a and a index
the (4, 1) and (1, 4) in the decomposition of the 8 with respect to su(4)  su(4) =
su(8) so(6, 6) (this is the basis considered by cvetic and hull in dening their nsns
5parameter solution, [21]). the group su(4) su(4) is the maximal compact subgroup
of the classical t duality group and decomposing with respect to it the 28 of su(8) will
dene which of the entries of z a b correspond to rr and which to nsns vectors (the
former will transform in the spinorial of su(4)2  so(6)2):

28  (6, 1) + (1, 6) + (4, 4)

(2.5)

the (6, 1) + (1, 6) part consists of the two diagonal blocks zab and zab and dene the
12 nsns (complex) charges, while the spinorial (4, 4) correspond to the odiagonal
block zaa and dene the 16 (complex) rr charges. the skewdiagonal elements which
will dene z n
n s correspond then to nsns charges (z12, z34, z12, z34) and therefore
the corresponding st u model will contain 4 nsns vector elds. let us work out the
embedding of gn and gc within e7(7). let the simple roots of e7(7) be n whose expression
with respect to an orthonormal basis n is the following:

1 = 1  2 ; 2 = 2  3 ; 3 = 3  4
4 = 4  5 ; 5 = 5  6 ; 6 = 5 + 6
2
7 = 
2

(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) +

1
2

7

(2.6)

the group hc = so(4)2  so(6)2  so(6, 6) consists of four su(2) factors acting sepa-
rately on the blocks (1, 2), (3, 4), (12), (34) of the central charge matrix. the centralizer
at the level of quantized charges gc on the other hand is the group so(4, 4) regularly

5

embedded in so(6, 6). if the latter is described by the simple roots 1, . . . , 6, a simple
choice, modulo s  t conjugations, for the dynkin diagram of gc would be 3, 4, 5, 6.
the solvable subalgebra of gc consists of only nsns generators. the algebra gn , being
characterized as the largest subalgebra of solv7 which commutes with gc, is immediately
dened, modulo isomorphisms, to be the [sl(2, ir)]3 algebra corresponding to the roots
1 = 27, 2 = 1  2 and 3 = 1 + 2. the scalar manifold of the corresponding st u

model has the form:

mst u =

gn
hn

=

su(1, 1)

u(1)

(1) 

so(2, 2)

so(2)  so(2)

(2, 3)

(2.7)

the reason why the above expression has been written in a factorized form is to stress the
dierent meaning of the two factors from the string point of view: the group su(1, 1)(1)
represents the classical sduality group of the theory and the corresponding factor of the
manifold is parameterized by the dilaton  and the axion b. in the same way it can be
shown that the second factor is parameterized by the scalars g44 , g55 , g45 and b45 and
its isometry group acts as a classical t duality, i.e.
its restriction to the integers is the
perturbative t duality of string theory. this nonsymmetric version of the st u model
is the same as the one obtained as a consistent truncation of the toroidally compactied
heterotic theory and therefore describes the generating solution also for this theory (the
string interpretation of the 4 scalars spanning the second factor in mst u is in general non
generalizable to the heterotic theory). therefore its microscopic corresponding structure
should be given in terms of ns states (fundamental string and ns5brane states).

2.2 the rr st u model

let us start with the central charge matrix zab obtained from z a b through an orthogonal
conjugation, such that the new index a of the 8 of su(8) assumes the values a =
1, 1, 2, 2, . . . , 4, 4, the unprimed and primed indices spanning the 4 of the two su(4)
subgroups previously dened. let us now consider the decomposition of su(8) with
respect to its subgroup u(1)  su(2)  su(6) (which is the decomposition suggested
by the killing spinor analysis of the 1/8 bps black holes) such that the 8 decomposes
into a (1, 2, 1) labeled by i = 4, 4 and a (1, 1, 6) labeled by ei = 1, 1, . . . , 3, 3. the 28
decomposes with respect to u(1)  su(2)  su(6) in the following way:

28  (1, 1, 1) + (1, 1, 15) + (1, 2, 6)

(2.8)

where the singlet represents the diagonal block zij, the (1, 1, 15) the diagonal block

zei,ej and the (1, 2, 6) is spanned by the o diagonal entries zi,ej. the skewdiagonal

6

entries which survive the gauge xing procedure dened above and thus entering the
new normal form of the central charge z n
rr are now z1 = z1,1,z2 = z2,2,z3 = z3,3
and z4 = z4,4, which are rr charges.
it is however interesting to notice that these
four (complex) charges are part of the set of 10 rr (complex) charges entering the
diagonal blocks (1, 1, 1) + (1, 1, 15). these charges can be immediately worked out by
counting the entries with mixed primed and unprimed indices (zab) contained in these
two blocks or in a group theoretical fashion by decomposing the (1, 1, 1) + (1, 1, 15)
in (2.8) and the (4, 4) in (2.5) with respect to a common subgroup u(1)  su(3) 
su(3) = [u(1)  su(6)][su(4)  su(4)]. both the decompositions contain a common
representation (1, 1, 1) + (1, 3, 3) describing 10 rr central charges. the 3 and 3 are
spanned by the values 1, 2, 3 and 1, 2, 3 of the indices a and a of the 4 and 4 respectively.
these charges correspond to the 1 + 9 vectors of an n = 2 truncation of the n = 8
theory with scalar manifold su(3, 3)/u(3)  su(3). a truncation of this theory yields
the st u model dened by the new su(8) gauge xing which brings the central charge
zab to the normal form z n
rr will depend on all the
8 rr quantized magnetic and electric charges ~qn
rr and the 6 scalar elds of the new
st u model. therefore, dierently to the previous dened class, in this case all gauge
elds (and hence the corresponding charges) come from rr 10 dimensional forms. the
centralizer so(4, 4) of ~qn
rr is now no more contained inside so(6, 6) and therefore its
solvable algebra contains rr generators as well. as a common feature of the truncations
belonging to this class, the scalars entering each quaternionic multiplet split into 2 nsns
and 2 rr. indeed the centralizer so(4, 4) is now the isometry group of the manifold
so(4, 4)/so(4) so(4) describing 16 hyperscalars and therefore its solvable algebra has
8 rr and 8 nsns generators 2.

rr. the 4 complex charges in z n

in order to specify a particular truncation within the class one should dene the
simple roots of so(4, 4) and of the isometry group [sl(2, ir)]3 of the st u model, which
in turn determines solv(mst u) and thus the scalar content of the model. an interesting
possibility is the one where the system of simple roots for so(4, 4) is chosen to be:

1 = 1 + 2 ; 3 = 3 + 4 ; 4 = 5 + 6

2 = 7

(2.9)

here the root 1 = 27 = p4

i=1 i belongs to the so(4, 4) root space. in the solvable
language, since the cartan generator and the shift operator corresponding to this root

2notice that any solution within a calabiyau compactication of type ii string lies in this class.
indeed all the vector elds surviving the compactication come from rr forms, both for type iia and
type iib theories.

7

are parameterized by  and b , these two scalars are now part of a hypermultiplet,
known as the universal sector. the isometry group of the st u model which commutes
with the above dened so(4, 4) centralizer is generated by a [sl(2, ir)]3 algebra which
is regularly embedded in the isometry group gl(6, ir) of the classical moduli space of t 6
and dened by the following roots:

1 = 1  2 ; 2 = 3  4 ; 3 = 5  6

(2.10)

the scalar manifold of this st u model is now symmetric among s, t, u since it is con-
tained in the moduli space of t 6 (its scalars are all nsns but there is no  and b):

mst u =

gn
hn

=

su(1, 1)

u(1)

(1) 

su(1, 1)

u(1)

(2) 

su(1, 1)

u(1)

(3)

(2.11)

from table 2 we can read out the scalar content of this model: g45 , g57 , g8 9 and 3 radii
(the latter being cartan generators). the interest in the above embedding is that all
the excited scalar elds, although nsns, come from the metric tensor gm n rather than
from the antisymmetric tensor bm n (on the contrary, and this is a common feature of
all embeddings falling in this class, all charges are rr). this means that this particular
embedding represents a pure rr solution whose microscopic description can be easily
given in terms of dbranes only. therefore, it is likely to look for the generating solution
within this particular embedding because this is the case where a microscopic entropy
counting can be more easily performed.

considering the embedding dened by eq.s (2.9)-(2.11), in the framework of type iia
supergravity the ten dimensional elds which contribute to the 4 dimensional solution are
gm n , am , am n p while bm n can be consistently put to zero. therefore one can easily see
that the microscopic conguration corresponding to a regular solution (either generating
or not) within this pure rr embedding should be given in terms of a 1/8 supersymmetry
preserving bound state of d0 , d2 , d4 and d6 branes without the presence of any kk
or nsbrane state. in the next section we will come back on this issue by considering
an explicit rr solution of the st u model, giving both its macroscopic and microscopic
description.

3 a pure rr solution and its microscopic description

let us now consider a specic example, namely a four parameter solution within the st u
model for which we shall give a microscopic description. from the macroscopic point of
view this solution is analogous to the one described in [22]. other macroscopic solutions
of the st u model have been obtained, for instance, in [23, 24, 25, 26].

8

let us very briey remind the structure of the st u model while a complete treatment
has been carried out in [25, 26]. the st u model is characterized by a n = 2 supergravity
theory coupled to 3 vector multiplets whose scalars spans the manifold mst u , eq.(2.4).
the total number of scalar elds in the game is 6 (zi = ai + ibi , i = 1, 2, 3) while the
number of charges (p, q) is 8 (4 electric and 4 magnetic). in the framework of the st u
model, the local realization on moduli space mst u of the n = 2 supersymmetry algebra
central charge z and of the 3 matter central charges z i associated with the 3 matter
vector elds are related to the n = 8 central charges eigenvalues in the following way:

z = i z4

, z i = hij

jz = ipi

z 

(3.1)

where ipi
 = 2bi(r) is the vielbein transforming rigid indices  (the one characterizing the
eigenvalues of the n = 8 central charge in its normal form, eq.(2.3)) to curved indices i
(see [25], section 3, for details).

the killing spinor equations characterizing the bps black hole solution translate into
rst order dierential equations for the relevant bosonic elds once suitable ansatze are
adopted. as a standard procedure, the vanishing of the gravitino transformation rule
along killing spinor directions implies a condition for the metric while the vanishing of the
dilatino transformations rule translates into equations for the scalar elds. the ansatze
for the metric g and the complex scalars zi are the following:

ds2 = e2u (r)dt2  e2u (r)d~x2
zi  zi(r)

(cid:16)r2 = ~x2(cid:17)

(3.2)

after some algebra one can see that, in the case in which the central charge is taken to
be real, the structure of the rst order bps equations turns out to be the following:

dzi
dr
du
dr

= 2  eu (r)
=   eu (r)

r2 ! hij
r2 !|z(z, z, p, q)|

j|z(z, z, p, q)|

(3.3)

which is a system of rst order dierential equations. working out the underlined geo-
metric structure of the st u model, the above system of equations can be made explicit
in terms of the scalar elds and the quantized charges (p, q) characterizing the model.
this has been fully worked out in [25, 26] (where the same conventions and notations has
been used), see in particular the appendices for explicit formul.

in this section we shall focus a particular (4parameter) regular solution for which
the microscopic description turns out to be particularly nice. on this solution the central

9

charge eigenvalues z, z4 are pure imaginary. this condition xes not only the [so(2)]3
symmetry of the model but also the overall phase  of the four central charge eigenvalues
( = 0 mod 2), yielding just four independent invariants |z|,|z4|.

since the central charge z4 is set to be imaginary (i.e. z real), the system of eqs.

(3.3) may be rewritten in the simpler form:

dzi
dr
du
dr

jz(z, z, p, q) =  eu (r)

r2 ! z i(z, z, p, q)

=   eu (r)
=   eu (r)

r2 ! hij
r2 ! z(z, z, p, q)

(3.4)

it is possible moreover to show that the reality of z is consistent with the regularity of

the solution provided we set p0 = 0. the conditions z = z  (and therefore z i = z i)
imply that the three axions are doublexed: a1,2,3(r)  af
1,2,3. they require also that
three electric quantized charges vanish, namely: q1 = q2 = q3 = 0.

hence the quantized charges left are (q0, p1, p2, p3) and the system of rst order dier-
ential equations our solution has to fulll reduces considerably. indeed the equations for
the dilatons and for u decouple from the axions and may be solved independently:

let us introduce the four harmonic functions as follows:

h(r) = a + k/r ( = 0, 1, 2, 3)

k0 = 2 q0

ki = 2 pi

it is easy to see that performing the following ansatz for the bi and the scalar function u:
b1 = s h0h1

both the rst and second order dierential equations are satised. choosing the metric to
be asymptotically at and standard values for the dilatons at innity, the four constants
a are set to be all equal to 1. the solution, consisting of the three bi, the doublexed
ai and u is expressed in terms of 4 independent charges (and four harmonic functions):
q0, p1, p2, p3. according to the ansatz (3.2) the metric has the following form:

(3.9)

ds2 = (h0h1h2h3)1/2 dt2  (h0h1h2h3)1/2 d~x2

and the macroscopic entropy, according to beckensteinhawking formula, reads:

(3.10)

(3.11)

smacro = 2 qq0p1p2p3

as far as the vector elds are concerned, their form in terms of the harmonic functions
introduced above is analogous to the one in the solution of [22] and we shall not give
it here. let us now move to the microscopic description of the above solution. this
will be easily obtained starting from the explicit expression of the n = 8 central charge
eigenvalues. comparing eq.s (3.3) and (3.5) one can see that the central charge eigenvalues
at spatial innity, when written in terms of the quantized charges, reads (in rigid indices):

(3.12)

according to the previous discussion, if the st u model is embedded in the full n = 8
theory according to formul(2.8),(2.9) and (2.10), the microscopic description of the above
solution can be given in terms of the intersection of four bunches of dbranes. indeed,
as explained in the previous section, provided a pure rr embedding, the central charge
z4 (which represents the n = 2 graviphoton dressed charge) and the matter charges
z ( = 1, 2, 3) are related to the gauge elds coming from the 10 dimensional rr
3form am n p coupling to d2 and d4branes and from the rr 1form am coupling to
d0 and d6branes. our solution is hence described, at the microscopic level, as a 1/8
supersymmetry preserving intersection of 4 bunches of these dbranes. the fact that
each of the central charge eigenvalues is real or pure imaginary (in our case they are all
pure imaginary) implies that the solution is pure electric or magnetic, that is it is not
made of electromagnetic dual objects.

one can think, for instance, of 3 bunches of orthogonal d4 branes (n1 , n2 , n3, re-
spectively) wrapped on the internal torus t 6 with n0 d0 branes on top of them. let
us consider the torus t 6 to be labeled with coordinates x4 , x5 , ..., x9 while the 4 dimen-
sional spacetime with coordinates x0 , x1 , x2 , x3. the d4branes are positioned in the
following way:

x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 x9

    
  


n1
n2   
n3     

table 1: the position of the d4 branes on the compactifying torus: for any given brane the
directions labeled with  are neumann while those labeled with  are dirichlet.

the above conguration is 1/8 supersymmetric and adding any number of d0 branes
the number of preserved supersymmetries does not change, [28]. the precise relation
between the above microscopic conguration and the macroscopic solution can be more
easily derived by writing the expression of the e7(7) quartic invariant as in [29]:

j4 = (|z1| + |z2| + |z3| + |z4|) (|z1|  |z2|  |z3| + |z4|) (|z1| + |z2|  |z3| + |z4|)
(3.13)

(|z1|  |z2| + |z3| + |z4|) + 8|z1||z2||z3||z4| (cos   1)
where, as well known, the entropy of the solution is s = j4.
in the case at hand
 = 0 mod 2 and the last term in the above equation drops out (according to the fact
that it is a four, rather than a ve parameters solution). the above expression reduces

12

to:

where, using relations (3.12), it follows:

j4 = s0s1s2s3

(3.14)

s0  (|z1| + |z2| + |z3| + |z4|) = 2q0
s1  (|z1|  |z2|  |z3| + |z4|) = 2p1
s2  (|z1| + |z2|  |z3| + |z4|) = 2p2
s3  (|z1|  |z2| + |z3| + |z4|) = 2p3

(3.15)

as noticed in [29], the charge vector basis we have chosen turns out to be the suitable
one for the microscopic identication, as for reading o the values of the integers n from
the relations (3.12). first notice that the 4 dimensional charge of a wrapped dpbrane is

qp = pvp/v6 where p = 2(2)3p is the normalized dpbrane charge density

in ten dimensions. provided the asymptotic values of the dilatons, which parameterize the
radii of the compactifying torus and which has been taken to be unitary, it turns out that,
in units where  = 1, the four dimensional quanta of charge for any kind of (wrapped)
dpbrane is equal to 2. on the contrary, our quantized charges (p, q) are integer
valued. hence the entropy formula (3.11) is reproduced microscopically by the above d
branes conguration, table 1, if we have precisely n0 = q0 , n1 = p1 , n2 = p2 , n3 = p3.
indeed the microscopic entropy counting for this conguration has been performed in [30]
and gives:

smicro = 2qn0n1n2n3

(3.16)

which exactly matches expression (3.11). from the conguration in table 1 one can
obtain, by various dualities, other four parameters solutions. for instance, t dualizing
on the whole t 6, one obtains a conguration made of n0 d6branes and 3 bunches
of (n1, n2, n3) d2branes localized in the planes (x4, x5), (x6, x7), (x8, x9) respectively.
under more general tdualities (i.e. those corresponding to so(6, 6; zz) elements which
have the eect of tilted tdualities, from the microscopic point of view) one can also
get dbrane congurations with the ns antisymmetric tensor switched on. or even,
acting with the full uduality group, congurations with other stringy states present. in
any case, this being not the generating solution, one cannot recover the full uduality
spectrum.

from the above four parameters conguration one could infer, in fact, the microscopic
structure of the ve parameters one. in [31] it has been noticed that the 5 parameters

13

solution could be obtained from the above switching on a em ux f on the d4branes
worldvolume in such a way to preserve supersymmetry. this would imply eective
additional d2 and d0 charge [32] and, from a macroscopic point of view, the switching
on of the real parts of the three matter central charges z1, z2, z3 (which would represent
eective d2brane charge). the microscopic entropy counting, in that case, should be
better performed in a t dual picture. indeed, t dualizing along x5 , x7 , x9 one would
end up with four bunches of type iib d3 branes (n0 , n1 , n2 , n3 respectively) at angles.
the overall angle (the fth parameter) would be determined essentially by the ux f
and would be the right one in order to preserve supersymmetry, that is, an u(3) angle,
[28]. for f = 0 one would get the d3branes to be orthogonal, hence recovering the four
parameter solution [33] (although in the t dual, type iib, picture).

4 comments and conclusions

the main aim of the present article was to dene in a precise mathematical fashion a
connection between the macroscopic analysis of 1/8 bps black hole solutions of n =
8, d = 4 supergravity carried out in [15, 17, 25, 26] and the microscopic description of
the subclass of these solutions carrying rr charge in terms of dbranes. to this end it
was necessary to single out in the uduality orbit of 1/8 bps black holes those charged
with respect to rr vector elds, once the n = 8 theory is interpreted as the lowenergy
limit of type ii superstring on t 6. the rst step in this direction was to characterize
geometrically the embedding of a class of st u models describing rr charged 1/8 bps
black holes within the d = 4 maximal supergravity. to achieve this we used the techniques
developed in [19, 20] in order to characterize geometrically the rr and the nsns ten
dimensional origin of the elds in the n = 8, d = 4 theory. as a byproduct we dened a
dual class of st u models describing nsns charged solutions in the same mathematical
fashion and the uduality relation between the two classes of st u models can be inferred
from their embedding in the larger n = 8 theory (this transformation is in the group
u = e7(7) but not in the subgroup s  t = sl(2, ir)  so(6, 6), since it does not
preserve the rr and nsns identities of the elds, while the models within each class
are related by s and t dualities ). eventually we focused on a particular representative of
the rr class of st u models and interpreted its elds in terms of their ten dimensional
origin. a particular 4parameter solution of this model was considered and a microscopic
interpretation of it was given in terms dbranes (a conguration of d4 and d0branes,
in the framework of type iia theory).

all these eorts have in fact some relevance in the study of regular bps black hole

14

solutions of toroidally compactied type ii string (or m) theory. on the one hand the
geometric characterization given allows one to identify the original ten dimensional elds
entering a given black hole solution quite easily and hence to infer its microscopic struc-
ture. on the other hand, once a solution is given then one can nd other solutions
via uduality transformations. the idea underlying this kind of reasoning is to try to
have a precise control on both the macroscopic and microscopic structures of all regular
stringy black holes related by uduality transformations, hence sharing the same entropy.
starting from a conguration for which a microscopic entropy counting is known (as for
instance pure dbranes congurations) one can then have an entropy prediction and a
description, both at macroscopic and microscopic levels, of those congurations for which
a microscopic entropy counting is out of present reach. this could help in revealing
the underlined common properties of very dierent black holes sharing the same entropy
and hence giving some insights into the basic properties of stringy oriented microscopic
entropy counting.

to accomplish such a program and then recover the full 56 dimensional uduality
orbit it is necessary to consider the ve parameter generating solution, which would be,
as already pointed out, intrinsically dyonic. although there exist in the literature some 5
parameters generating solutions, [34, 35, 26], the interpretation, at the microscopic level,
of the parameters entering these solution is quite dicult, especially as far as the fth
one is concerned. hence a simple and clear description of the generating solution, both
at macroscopic and microscopic level, is still missing. the completion of this program is
left to a future work.

table 2: the correspondence between the positive roots m,n of the u duality algebra e7(7)
and the scalar elds parameterizing the moduli space for either iia and iib compactications.

the notation m,n (m = 1, . . . , 6, n = 1, . . . , d(m)) for the positive roots was introduced in [19].
the seven cartan generators correspond to the dilaton and the six radii.
