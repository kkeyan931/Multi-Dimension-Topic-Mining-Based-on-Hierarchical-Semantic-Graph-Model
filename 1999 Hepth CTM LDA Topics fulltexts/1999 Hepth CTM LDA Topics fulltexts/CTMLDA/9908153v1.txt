generalized conformal symmetry and oblique
ads/cft correspondence for matrix theory

abstract. the large n behavior of matrix theory is discussed on the basis of
the previously proposed generalized conformal symmetry. the concept of oblique
ads/cft correspondence, in which the conformal symmetry involves both the space-
time coordinates and the string coupling constant, is proposed. based on the explicit
predictions for two-point correlators, possible implications for the matrix-theory
conjecture are discussed.

pacs numbers: 11.25.-w, 04.60.-m

the matrix-theory conjecture [1] requires us to investigate the dynamics of d-particles
described by the supersymmetric yang-mills matrix quantum mechanics in the large
n limit. unfortunately, very little is known as for the relevant large n behaviors of
the matrix quantum mechanics. in the present talk, i shall discuss the large n limit
of matrix theory by extending the ads/cft correspondence to the matrix quantum
mechanics using the previously proposed generalized conformal symmetry as a guide.

the paper is organized into three parts. in the rst part, i begin by briey recalling
the matrix-theory conjecture and review the so-called dlcq interpretation at nite n.
the latter interpretation will be used as an intermediate step for our later arguments.
then in the second part, after a brief discussion on the generalized conformal symmetry
[2, 3] from the point of view of the ads/cft correspondence, i introduce the notion
of oblique ads/cft correspondence for nonconformal d0-branes. in the third part, i
discuss the results of the harmonic analysis of supergravity uctuations around the d-
particle background and its predictions for the two-point corrrelators of matrix theory
operators in the large n limit, based on our recent work [4] which contains, to my
knowledge, the rst extensive computation of the correlators for dilatonic case based
on the ads/cft correspondence. i then propose to interpret the anomalous large n
scaling behavior found from this analysis as an indication of a screening mechanism
which may reconcile the holographic growth of the transverse size with 11 dimensional
boost invariance.

1. matrix-theory conjecture and the dlcq interpretation

the basic assumption of matrix theory [1] is that the low-energy eective super yang-
mills theory of d-particles in type iia superstring theory is the exact description of
m-theory in the innite-momentum limit where the total 11th dimensional momentum
p10 becomes innite:

p10 = n/r  ,

(1.1)

where r = gss is the radius of the 11th dimension, which is compactied to a circle,
and n is the number of d-particles. the d-particles are now interpreted as partons as
the basic constituents of m-theory. the eective action is

in the innite-momentum limit, the 11th momentum and the hamiltonian can be
identied with the light-like momentum and the light-like hamiltonian, respectively.

where we have introduced the 11 dimensional planck length p = g1/3
s s. for any
nite and xed r, the innite-momentum limit requires the large n limit, n  .
the (super) galilean symmetry of this system is indeed consistent with the innite-
momentum frame interpretation.

obviously, the innite-momentum limit can also be achieved for xed n if we take
the limit of small compactication circle, r  0, namely the type iia limit. if we boost
 = n/r, this denes a theory in which the system is eectively
back to a nite p 
compactied along the light-like direction x  x + 2r. this is nothing but the
discrete light-cone interpretation (dlcq), proposed by susskind [5] and elucidated in
[6]. the basic assumption for this interpretation is that the dynamics is invariant under
the boost along the 11th direction for nite and xed n in contrast to the original bfss
conjecture which assumes that the boost is associated with a change of n for xed r.
in fact, if we x the 11 dimensional planck length, the hamiltonian and p transform as
desired, p   p  under the change, r  r  p  1p, of the compactication
radius. this may be called as the kinematical boost transformation, contrasting to the
dynamical boost of the bfss conjecture. usually, the limit r  0 (r  p ) which
corresponds to the weak-coupling limit gs  0 is regarded as justifying the matrix model,
since the characteristic length scale   p of the model is now much smaller p  s
than the string scale, and hence the massive string modes of the open strings stretched
among d-particles are decoupled as long as we are interested only in the energy range
much smaller than the characteristic string unit e( p +)  1
s . the two conditions,
  p and e  1
s , which might look naively contradictory to each other, can be

.

s

compatible since now the eective mass m  1/gss in 10 dimensional space-time is
very heavy and the characteristic velocity of d-particles is given by v  g2/3

however, it should be emphasized that the dlcq interpretation cannot be regarded
as a proof that the matrix model is consistent with supergravity in the long-distance
limit.
in the limit of small compactication radius, 11 dimensional supergravity
reduces to 10 dimensional type iia supergravity. only natural justication of type iia
supergravity relying upon the dimensional arguments is the zero-slope limit in which
  s by keeping the 11 dimensional planck length 10 = g1/4
s s xed. this limit clearly
exceeds the range of the dlcq region   s. note that the low-energy limit   p
in the sense of 11 dimensions can be used as a criterion only in the decompactication
(i.e, strong coupling) limit r   for xed p .

in spite of this apparent disagreement on the ranges of validity, the leading low-
velocity expansions for the scattering phase shifts for the matrix model and supergravity
are known to give precisely the same results at long-distance regime   p in lower
order perturbation theory with respect to gs. the supersymmetric nonrenormalization
theorem [7] is responsible for this result at least to the rst nontrivial order.
it is
not clear whether the supersymmetry is sucient to explain a much more nontrivial
result [8] at two-loop order which contains the nonlinear self-interaction of graviton. an
important task in matrix theory is to clarify to what extent the coincidence between
the matrix model for nite n and the supergravity in the dlcq limit is valid, and, if
the coincidence stops at some point, where and how it occurs. this is not, however, the
issue on which i would like to focus in the present talk. for a previous review, see e.g.
[9]. let us return to the large n limit.

in contrast to the dlcq interpretation, the matrix-theory conjecture requires that
boost transformation in going to the innite-momentum frame is equivalent to taking
the large n limit with xed r. since p +p  = n tr h/2 has to be boost-invariant,
the whole nontrivial spectrum must then be contained in the region where the spectrum
of the operator tr h scales as o(1/n). namely, the hamiltonian p  must be scaled
as o(r/n). if we study the correlators of the theory instead of the spectrum directly,
this amounts to taking the scaling limit with respect to time as t  nt. in view of the
analogy with light-cone formulation of membranes, it is not unreasonable to suppose
that an appropriate large n limit of the matrix model captures the full structure of
type iia/m theory. as we shall discuss shortly, the large n limit indeed enables us to
go beyond the dlcq region, namely, go to the region of length scales much larger than
the string scale.

one of the puzzles related to this conjecture is that the holographic property which
should be satised as a proper quantum theory of gravity requires that the size of the
system with respect to the transverse directions must grow indenitely in the large n
boost transformation. the reason is that the boost transformation increases the number
of partons. since the information carried by a single parton is expected to be coded in
a transverse volume at most of planck size, the transverse volume of the total system
must grow at least as fast as n which means that the transverse size is at least of order

o(n 1/9) in the limit n  . thus a crucial issue in studying the large n behavior
of matrix theory is how to reconcile these properties with the boost invariance.
in
the light-cone formulation of string theory, we parametrize the strings such that the
density of the light-like momentum is uniform along the string and also is constant
with respect to the light-cone time. the number of string bits is then proportional
to the light-like momentum. however no violation of lorentz invariance occurs in the
nal results of scattering amplitudes. in matrix theory, similarly, there must be some
mechanism by which the apparent growth of the transverse size could be compatible
with 11 dimensional lorentz invariance .

2. generalized conformal symmetry and oblique ads/cft correspondence

let us now consider the following question: can we extract any nontrivial information
on the large n limit of matrix theory from the ads/cft type correspondence? this
problem must have been touched upon by many authors from dierent perspectives.
due to the limited space, i can only mention a few [10] [11] which are closely related to
the present talk. for other related works, i recommend the readers to consult references
in these cited works. however, to my knowledge, no concrete results have been reported
on the behavior of the correlation functions of matrix theory along this direction. in our
previous works [2, 3], we have proposed to approach the problem from the viewpoint of
a generalized conformal symmetry.

in the usual ads/cft correspondence, the existence of conformal symmetry
plays crucial roles. the classication of the spectrum with respect to the conformal
symmetry on both sides of bulk and boundary theory and agreement between them are
the strongest piece of evidence for the correspondence. furthermore, the conjectured
correspondence of the correlators between the bulk theory and the conformal eld theory
at the boundary of the near-horizon region again relies upon the conformal symmetry
of the bulk theory in the whole near-horizon region. therefore it is natural to seek the
possible generalization of the conformal symmetry for non-conformal branes in extending
the correspondence to non-conformal d-branes.

let us start by examining the structure of the classical d0-solution:

(2.6)

where the charge q is given by q = 603()7/2gsn. in the near horizon limit q/r7  1,
the factor 1 + q/r7 is replaced by q/r7 and the metric is rewritten as

(2.7)

we can check that the metric, dilaton and the 1-form a0dt are all invariant under
the scale and the special conformal transformations if they are accompanied by the

transformations of the string coupling as

r  r, t  1t, gs  3gs,
kt = (t2 +

2q
5r5 ),

kr = 2tr,

kgs = 6tgs,

(2.8)

(2.9)

which together with time translation form an so(1, 2) algebra. an important feature of
this generalized conformal symmetry is that the would-be ads radius  as a function of
r is invariant under the transformation. namely, although the background space-time is
not adss8, it behaves almost like that, since the r-dependent radius (r) is invariant.
the same generalized symmetry is satised for matrix-theory

furthermore,

lagrangian:

xi  xi, t  1t, gs  3gs,
kxi = 2txi, kt = t2, kgs = 6tgs.

(2.10)

(2.11)

the dierence between kt in (2.9) and (2.11) has the same origin as in the usual
case of d3-brane: the mechanism how the additional term 2q
5r5 in (2.11) emerges in
the bulk theory was claried in refs.
[3] for general case of dp -branes from the point
of view of matrix models, namely, from the boundary theory. i also remark that this
generalization of conformal symmetry has been motivated at a deeper level by the space-
time uncertainty principle [12] as has been discussed in [2] in detail.

another comment which is perhaps worthwhile to make here is that the
generalized conformal symmetry is regarded as the underlying symmetry for the dlcq
interpretation. we are free to change the engineering scales. thus, if one wants to keep
the numerical value of the transverse dimensions, we perform a rescaling t  1t, xi 
1xi, s  1s simultaneously with the generalized scaling transformation leading
to the scaling t  2t, xi  xi, r  2r and p  p which is equivalent with the
kinematical boost transformation. alternatively, one might want to keep the numerical
value of time or energy by making a rescaling t  t, xi  xi, s  s, leading
to the scaling t  t, r  4r, xi  2xi, p  2p and s  s, which is in
fact equivalent to the tilde transformation utilized in [6]. note that although the
second case makes the string length s small by assuming small , the length scale of
transverse directions smaller than the string scale is always sent to even smaller length
scale (< 2s).

in view of these symmetry properties, it is quite natural to suppose that the similar
correspondence between supergravity and yang-mills matrix quantum mechanics is
valid as in the typical case of d3-brane between supergravity and 4 dimensional super
yang-mills theory. we now examine the conditions [13] [14] for the validity of the
correspondence. for comparison, we indicate the corresponding conditions for the case
of d3-brane in parentheses. we neglect numerical coecients in writing down these
conditions.

(2.14)

in both cases of d0 and d3, the near horizon conditions (2.12) are by denition
not invariant under the (generalized) conformal transformation, while the other two
conditions (2.13) and (2.14) are invariant. the former indicates that the boundary of
(r  (gsn)1/4 :
the near-horizon or conformal region should be assumed at r  q1/7
d3). note that in the case of ordinary ads/cft correspondence, both the near-
horizon condition and the small curvature conditions are characterized by a single scale
(gsn)1/4s = 10n 1/4, while in the present case they are dierent.

both the dierence and the common features in the above conditions for d0 and
in fig. 1, the lines representing the

near-horizon boundary and the small-curvature boundary (dashed), as well as the ow
lines (with arrows) of the generalized conformal transformation, are tilted comparing
to the corresponding lines of fig. 2, while the topologies of those lines are essentially
the same for r > 0. note that the condition of small string coupling is automatically
satised for nite r > 0 in the t hooft limit by keeping gsn xed. in the oblique case,
contrary to the ordinary case, the near horizon region with small eective curvature
contains the dlcq region gsn < 1. this is due to the r dependence of the quasi ads
size (r). however, this does not mean that the correspondence is valid when restricted
in the weak coupling region, since by the generalized conformal transformation even
the dlcq region is sent to the strong coupling region gsn > 1 at the near-horizon
boundary.

on the other hand, the limit of large coupling t hooft gsn   enables us to
approach the bfss region. here, it is crucial to realize that the oblique ads/cft
correspondence is limited at the boundary of the near horizon condition which is at
the distance of order r  q1/7  (gsn)1/7s, just like that the ordinary ads/cft
correspondence for d3 case is limited at the boundary r  (gsn)1/4s. it is natural to
suppose that these distances are the infrared cutos for the corresponding yang-mills
theory with respect to the range of values of transverse coordinates, namely, the cutos
for the magnitude of the higgs elds xi.

3. predictions for 2-point functions and anomalous large n scaling behavior

armed by these considerations, we are now ready to discuss the large n behavior of
the two-point correlators. the strategy for doing this is the following. first step:
we establish the correspondence between the supergravity uctuations and the matrix-
model operators relying upon the generalized conformal symmetry. namely, we derive
the two-point correlators assuming the now familiar conjecture that the supergravity
action is the generating functional of the matrix model correlators. we will follow the
prescription of [15], which assumes the boundary at r  q1/7 (r  (gsn)1/4s : d3)
and extracts the universal part of the correlators as the nonanalytically (in momentum
space) behaved part. this is more convenient for us than the more formal prescription
adopted in [16]. we also note that the singularity of the metric and the dilaton
essentially cancels at the horizon and the behavior of the kinetic radial term of
g.
the eective action at the horizon is not much dierent from the d3 case: e.
t ) as r  0 for the scalar eld. hence the singularity
does not cause any harm for our program. as remarked previously, the generalized
scaling transformation is equivalent to the kinematical boost transformation. thus the
rst step amounts to utilizing the dlcq interpretation of the matrix model. since the
range of validity for the oblique ads/cft correspondence contains the dlcq region
(gsn  0) and bfss region (gsn  )as two opposite extreme limits (see fig. 1), we
can expect that the behavior of the correlators should also be consistent with the bfss
interpretation, if the latter is indeed correct. the second step is then to consider the
large n scaling behavior of the correlators by making the rescaling t  nt.

let us now determine the general form of the two-point correlators using the relation

where  is of course the wick-rotated euclidian time and i labels independent
diagonalized degrees of freedom in the spectrum of the supergravity uctuations and the
corresponding matrix-model operators with denite generalized conformal dimensions.
this shows that the connected two-point functions are just given by the supergravity
action evaluated to the second order of the boundary value i
0. since, apart from the

the eective action only through q  gsn7

where we have assumed that the matrix-model operators are normalized such that their

conformal dimension of the operator; namely oi( )  o
  =
s = 3gs for scaling, and similarly for special conformal transformation.
1,
in [4], we have performed a complete harmonic analysis of the bosonic uctuations
around the d0 background and explicitly conrmed the validity of the above formula
for all the bosonic physical uctuations of supergravity. the bosonic uctuations are
z2(cid:17)i(z,  ) = 0, where
described by the modied bessel equation, (cid:16)2
z = 2q1/2r5/2/5 is the quasi-poincare coordinate and the order of the bessel function
is related to the generalized conformal dimension by i = 1 + 10
7 i. the spectrum of
the dimensions i is classied from the 11 dimensional viewpoint as i = 1+2ni + 4
7i
where ni = 1n+ +n is determined by the kinematical boost dimensions n, which are
nothing but the number of upper light-cone indices  respectively, and i is the order of
the harmonics. the factional dependence on the order of the harmonics comes from our
normalization of the operators such that their engineering dimensions are uniformly 1,
which leads to the harmonic expansion in terms of the normalized transverse coordinates
xi = xi/q1/7. the results for the generalized conformal dimensions are consistent with
the known results [18] from the lowest order perturbative computation for the matrix-
model operators coupled with supergravity elds. note that since we are just dealing
with quantum mechanics there is no problem in determining the (generalized) conformal
dimensions of these operators. a few examples of the operators o( ) are

for more details, i would like to invite the reader to the paper [4].

let me mention some notable features of our results before discussing the
implications for the bfss conjecture. first, the correlators have fractional dependence
on both gs and n, which can never be reproduced from the perturbative computations
of the correlators. this is not surprising if we recall that such perturbative computations
would be plagued by infrared divergencies. furthermore, the angular-momentum
independent part of the gs-and n- dependencies of the the dilaton-10d energy-
momentum correlators ( = 1 + 4
7) agree with that of the entropy [19] of the
nonextremal d0 solution at a given temperature th : s  n 2(gsn)3/5(sth)9/5. this
provides evidence for the fact that the correlator corresponding to the energy-momentum
tensor without mixing of other modes adequately counts the number of degrees of

generalized conformal symmetry and oblique ads/cft correspondence . . .

freedom in the low-energy regime of many d-particle dynamics from 10 dimensional
viewpoint.

let us nally discuss the large n scaling behavior of the result (3.16) and its
implications. by making the scaling for the time 1  2  n(1  2), we nd that the
correlators scale as n 2dim f with

dim f = (1 +

1
5

)(n+  n  1)  (

).

(3.17)

it is remarkable that except for the additional fraction 1/5 in both the rst and the
second term in (3.17), this is just consistent with the boost transformation of the
operators. note that the faction 1/7 just accounts for one factor of n in 1/q1/7 coming
from the normalization. what is not clear is the origin of the anomalous dimensions
in
1/5 for the transverse directions and 1/5 for the upper light-cone indices .
particular, the large n scaling implies a shrinking behavior n 1/5 in the transverse
direction, which is quite opposite to what we naively expect from holography!

does this contradict holography? not necessarily. the reason is that the large-
time correlators of the operators with higher partial waves are not directly measuring
the extension of wave functions. it is conceivable that the complicated time-dependent
dynamics eectively screens the correlation with respect to the transverse extension
of the wave functions. after all, it is very hard to believe that the dynamics in the
large n imf could be consistent with supergravity, unless the holographic growth of
the system is somehow screened to become an unobservable eect. here we have to
recall that the oblique ads/cft correspondence on which the above results are based
has an intrinsic infrared cuto r < rb  q1/7  n 1/7. this bound is bigger than
the well known mean-eld estimate n 1/9. the same estimate is also obtained from a
simple counting of the degree of freedom for describing the schwarzschild black hole in
matrix theory [17]. however, it is much smaller than the lower bound of order n 1/3
[10] for the eigenvalue distribution which is derived using a virial theorem. thus, the
oblique ads/cft correspondence only enables us to predict the large n behaviors of
the system put in a box whose size is much smaller than the real quantum system, while
it is bigger than the classical size of the individual objects. to discuss the system whose
size is consistent with the lower bound, we have to renormalize the system to bigger
sizes. this is a dicult dynamical problem.

here we may reverse the direction of the arguments. instead of directly studying the
size renormalization, we can ask what the size of the system must be if we demand that
the large n behavior be consistent with boost invariance. since the consistency with
boost invariance requires that there should be no anomalous dimensions with respect to
the transverse directions, let us change the cuto for the distribution of the eigenvalue
by making a scaling xi  n 1/5xi at xed gs and n. if we assume that the similarity
law is satised for this system, the scaling changes the infrared cuto from the order
n 1/7 to the order n 1/5  n 1/7 = n (1/3)+,  = 1/105. this is consistent with and is
very close to the lower bound  n 1/3. although this argument is very naive and it
is not at all clear whether this procedure eliminates the anomalous dimensions in the

generalized conformal symmetry and oblique ads/cft correspondence . . .

10

light-like directions too, it might be regarded as a signal for the consistency of the large
n scaling behavior with 11 dimensional boost invariance. we should however keep in
mind also that our discussion is limited in the region of weak string coupling no matter
how gsn is large.

apart from clarifying the above question, there are many future problems which
should be studied. to conclude, i enumerate a few of them: (1) the study of the
representation theory of the super generalized conformal algebra, (2) the computations
of three and higher-point functions and their implications, and (3) possible applications
to the computation of s-matrix in the large n limit.
