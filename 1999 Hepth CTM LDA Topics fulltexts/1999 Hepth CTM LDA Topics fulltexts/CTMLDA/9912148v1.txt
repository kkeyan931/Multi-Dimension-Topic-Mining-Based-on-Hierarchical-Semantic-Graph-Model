in this comment we discuss some serious inconsistencies presented by gomes, malacarne and da

silva in their paper, phys.rev. d60 (1999) 125016 (hep-th/9908181).

in the paper of ref. [1], gomes, malacarne and da silva, set up some conclusions about the dynamics and interactions
between charged vector bosons () and the gauge eld (a) in 3 dimensions. besides, they also discuss the issue
of 1-loop renormalizability. this comment is devoted to point out some inconsistencies in their misleading analysis;
mainly, we criticize the way the authors heavily use the ward identities to ensure 1-loop renormalizability for a
model which is not even unitary at tree-level thanks to the violation of the froissart-martin bound.

according to the results previously worked out in the papers of refs. [24], following a line initiated by [5], it is
known that charged vector elds minimally (or non-minimally) coupled to a gauge eld display severe problems in
what concerns the quantum-mechanical consistency of the model. to be more specic: unitarity is jeopardized by
complex massive vector elds, regardless the mass is introduced via a proca or a chern-simons term, as we shall
clarify below.

the authors of ref. [1] claim that, even if a proca term assigns mass to the charged vector eld, the 1-loop
renormalizability of the model is guaranteed by virtue of the identity of eq.(16) in their paper. however, the use
of such an identity in the calculation of 1-loop graphs such as vacuum-polarization and the 4-point function for the
chern-simons eld is not appropriate to reduce the supercial degree of divergence, for there is not reason to set the
momenta associated to the matter-eld lines in the 3-vertex equal to zero. our remark is that there is no way to tame
the ultraviolet divergences brought about by the proca term. on the other hand, following the results of [24], the
dynamical induction of a proca term always takes place for topologically massive complex vector elds. the criterium
that is neglected in the analysis of the work of ref. [1] (the same criticism applies to the work by bezerra de mello
and mostepanenko [6]) is the lack of reference to the froissart-martin bound in 3 dimensions [7,8], which is of the
type s lns for the total scattering squared amplitude in a compton-like process. though it is not very evident,
the actually serious problem of the massive proca complex vector eld is that it leads to a clear violation of the
froissart-martin unitarity bound in 3 dimensions, yielding an upper bound of the form s2 [2]. had we started with
a topologically massive complex vector eld, unitarity would apparently be respected through the froissart-martin
bound [7,8], since an upper bound of the type s0 [2] shows up for that case; nevertheless, a proca term (
) is
always radiatively induced and a non-unitary bound s2 drops out [24].

our comment sets out to raise the question whether it is sensible to consider the massive charged vector model
beyond the tree-approximation, once, as stated above, the unitarity bound is clearly violated at that approximation.
usually, we draw our attention to the renormalizability and unitarity by taking into account power-counting, counter-
terms, ward identities and the positivity of the states in the hilbert space. though these are necessary requirements to
be fullled, some additional criteria ought to be checked, such as the validity of the froissart-martin bound. the class
of models discussed in refs. [1,6] is a good warning example for what we have just mentioned: though the analysis of

propagators and power-counting seems to point out to a healthy model in the case of maxwell-chern-simons theory
for the complex vector eld, the induction of the proca mass breaks the unitarity bound and we believe it is not
sensible to go beyond tree-level, or, in short, to second-quantize such a model.

we should also stress that the introduction of a gauge-invariant non-minimal magnetic coupling, which in the proca
case is non-renormalizable, does not restore the froissart-martin bound in that case of maxwell-chern-simons-proca
model for the charged vector eld, as it was attained in ref. [2].

to end our short comment, we conclude that, besides the lack of power-counting renormalizability, unitarity is the
key ingredient to rule out the theory of massive charged vector elds coupled to a gauge eld in 3 dimensions as a
fundamental eld theory, therefore, the results of refs. [2,3] turn those of ref. [1] useless.
