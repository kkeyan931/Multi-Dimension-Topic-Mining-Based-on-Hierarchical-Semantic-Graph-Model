self-gravitating su(2) higgs magnetic monopoles exist up to a critical value of the ratio of
the vector meson mass to the planck mass, which depends on the higgs boson mass. at the
critical value a critical solution with a degenerate horizon is reached. as pointed out by lue and
weinberg, there are two types of critical solutions, with a transition at an intermediate higgs
boson mass. here we investigate this transition for black holes, and reconsider it for the case of
gravitating monopoles.

i. introduction

in the su(2)-einstein-yang-mills-higgs model, gravitating magnetic monopoles and non-abelian black holes
exist in a certain region of the parameter space [13]. for a xed value of the higgs boson mass, gravitating
monopoles exist up to a critical value cr (of the parameter , which is proportional to the ratio of the vector meson
mass to the planck mass), and non-abelian black holes exist up to a critical value cr(xh) (for small enough values
of the horizon radius xh [3]). at the critical value cr a critical solution with a degenerate horizon is reached. in
particular, for small values of the higgs boson mass, the critical solution where a horizon rst appears corresponds
to an extremal reissner-nordstrm (rn) solution outside the horizon while it is non-singular inside.

recently lue and weinberg [4] reconsidered self-gravitating magnetic monopoles. in particular, they observed,
that for larger values of the higgs boson mass, the critical solution is an extremal black hole with non-abelian
hair and a mass less than the extremal rn value. exploring the transition between the two regimes, occurring at
some intermediate value of the higgs boson mass, lue and weinberg were left with a discrepancy between their
analytical and numerical results [4].

here we extend the investigation of lue and weinberg to non-abelian black holes, showing the transition to
persist in the presence of xed nite event horizon radii xh. furthermore, we reconsider the case of gravitating
monopoles and argue, that the discrepancy between lue and weinbergs analytical and numerical results [4] can
be traced back to their limited numerical analysis.

value. variation of the action eq. (1) with respect to the metric g, the gauge eld aa
 and the higgs eld a
leads to the einstein equations and the matter eld equations.

to construct static spherically symmetric globally regular and black hole solutions we employ schwarzschild-like

coordinates and adopt the spherically symmetric metric [5,6]

with the metric functions a(r) and n (r),

ds2 = g dxdx = a2n dt2 + n 1dr2 + r2(d2 + sin2 d2) ,

where m(r) ist the mass function.

for the gauge and higgs elds we employ the standard spherically symmetric ansatz with vanishing time

component of the gauge eld [14]

we note that the embedded rn solution with mass  and unit magnetic charge

iii. gravitating monopoles

let us rst consider the globally regular particle-like solutions of the su(2) eymh system, the gravitating
monopoles. requiring asymptotically at solutions implies that the metric functions a and  both approach a
constant at innity. we here adopt

and () =  represents the dimensionless mass of the solutions. the matter functions also approach constants
asymptotically,

a() = 1 ,

(17)

regularity of the solutions at the origin requires

k() = 0 , h() = 1 .

(0) = 0 , k(0) = 1 , h(0) = 0 .

(18)

(19)

let us now recall how the gravitating magnetic monopole solutions approach critical solutions, when the vector
boson mass, i.e. a, is varied, while the ratio of the higgs boson mass to the vector boson mass, i.e. b, is kept xed.
we focus on intermediate values of b.

lue and weinberg [4] realized that there are two regimes of b, each with its own type of critical solution. in
the rst regime b is small. here the metric function n (x) of the monopole solutions always possesses a single
minimum. with increasing a the minimum of the function n (x) decreases. for a  acr, the critical solution is
approached, where the minimum of the function n (x) reaches zero at x = x0, eq. (16). for x  x0 the critical
solution corresponds to an extremal rn black hole solution with horizon radius xh = x0 and unit magnetic charge,
eq. (15). consequently, the mass of the limiting solution coincides with the mass of this extremal rn black hole,
eq. (16). however, in the interior region, x < x0, the critical solution is not singular, in particular n (0) = 1. we
refer to this approach to the critical solution as rn-type behaviour. rn-type behaviour was seen for gravitating
monopoles and black holes [13] as well as for gravitating dyons and dyonic black holes [5,6].

in the newly found [4] second regime b is large, and the metric function n (x) of the monopole solutions develops
a second minimum as the critical solution is approached. this second minimum arises interior to the location
of the rst minimum, the solution therefore now possesses an inner and an outer minimum. once present, the
inner minimum decreases faster with increasing a than the outer minimum. consequently, the inner minimum
reaches zero, when the outer minimum still has a nite value, which is indeed not too dierent from the value
it had, when the inner minimum rst appeared. thus for a  acr, the inner minimum of n (x) reaches zero at
x = x < x0. this second approach to the critical solution is demonstrated in fig. 1, where we show the function
n (x) for b = 36.125 and several values of a close to acr. here the critical solution possesses an extremal horizon
at x < x0, corresponding to an extremal black hole with non-abelian hair and a mass less than the extremal rn
value. consequently, we refer to this approach to the critical solution as na-type (non-abelian-type) behaviour.
in their paper [4] lue and weinberg investigated analytically the transition from rn-type behaviour to na-
type behaviour. one of their central analytical results is, that rn-type behaviour is possible only for a > 1.5,
making atr = 1.5 the critical value, where the transition from rn-type to na-type behaviour should occur. this
lower bound is found by an accurate analytical expansion of the solution about the point x = x0, where n (x)
has a double zero. the hypotheses used are mild and, very likely, fullled by the solutions.

when investigating the transition from rn-type to na-type behaviour numerically, lue and weinberg [4]
observe, that with increasing b the critical value acr decreases. for small b the critical value acr is larger than
the analytical transition value atr, and the behaviour is of rn-type as expected. as b is increased, and acr
decreases towards atr = 1.5 the behaviour remains of rn-type. (atr = 1.5 would correspond to b  25.6 [4].)
but surprisingly, as atr = 1.5 is passed, lue and weinberg do not immediately observe the transition to na-type
behaviour. instead they continue to see numerically rn-type behaviour until a value acr = 1.42, corresponding
to b  40, which is clearly below their analytical prediction for the transition.
convinced by the analytical argument given by lue and weinberg [4] for the transition value, we argue in the
following that the numerically observed discrepancy arises only because of their interpretation of their in accuracy
limited numerical analysis.

3

performing an independent numerical analysis (see appendix for details), we observe that na-type behaviour
occurs indeed for lower values of b than b = 40 and thus larger values of a than a = 1.42. numerically we nd
na-type behaviour for b > 30. this is illustrated in figs. 2 and 3, where we present the critical value acr  1
and the ratio x/x0 as functions of b, respectively, in the na-type regime. these gures should be compared to
figs. 10 and 8 of [4], respectively.

a crucial point of the numerical analysis is illustrated in fig. 4. when for a xed value of b in the na-type
regime the critical solution is approached, the inner minimum appears at a certain minimal value of a. in fig. 4
we present the value of the function n (x) at the outer minimum at this certain minimal value of a (where the
inner minimum appears) as a function of b. clearly, for 40 > b > 30, the inner minimum of the metric function
n (x) appears only, when the value of the function n (x) at the outer minimum is already very small. indeed, with
decreasing b it is decreasing from a value on the order of 106 to a value on the order of 109. obviously, with
decreasing b it becomes numerically increasingly dicult, to observe na-type behaviour at all. as illustrated
in fig. 5 for b = 36.125, once the inner minimum is present, the value of the inner minimum of n (x) decreases
rapidly with increasing a, whereas the value of the outer minimum remains practically unchanged.

even though our numerical analysis is not accurate enough to nd na-type behaviour for b < 30, we expect it
to be present until atr = 1.5 is reached. linear extrapolation of the curve in fig. 2 leads to btr = 25.58, while (a
less accurate) extrapolation of the curve in fig. 4 leads to btr = 26.7 [7]. thus our numerical analysis strongly
supports the analytical result of lue and weinberg [4].

what concerns their numerical results, we fully agree with their explicit calculations as far as presented in [4].
however, lue and weinberg do not consider numerical solutions, where the value of the outer minimum is smaller
than 106 [4,8]. thus they miss na-type solutions for values of b smaller than about 40, as seen from fig. 4.
indeed, if we extract from our numerical data a modied critical value of a by requiring that the value of the
minimum of n (x) should be 106 [8] instead of requiring that it should be zero, we obtain full agreement with
fig. 10 of lue and weinberg [4].

iv. black holes

we now turn to the black hole solutions of the su(2) eymh system. imposing again the condition of asymptotic
atness, the black hole solutions satisfy the same boundary conditions at innity as the regular solutions. the
existence of a regular event horizon at xh requires

and a(xh) < , and the matter functions must satisfy

(xh) =

xh
2

,

and

(20)

(21)

(22)

.

,

n k |xh = k(cid:18) k 2  1

x2 + h 2(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)xh
x2n h |xh = h(cid:0)2k 2 + 2x2(h 2  1)(cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:12)xh

magnetically charged non-abelian black hole solutions exist only in a limited region of the (a, xh) plane [13],
as illustrated for instance for b = 0 in fig. 7 of [2]. when a is varied, while b and the horizon radius xh are kept
xed, magnetically charged non-abelian black holes also approach critical solutions [13].

extending the above analysis to the case of black holes, we observe again two regimes of b, each with its own
type of critical solution corresponding to na-type and rn-type behaviour, respectively. since the transition value
atr = 1.5 is obtained by performing a taylor expansion about a point far from the horizon and by making use
of the rst few terms of this expansion, we expect this result to hold also in the case of black holes.

our numerical results for black holes with horizon radius xh = 0.01 and 0.1 are included in figs. 2-4, along
with the corresponding results for the regular solutions. we observe a complete analogy of the results for regular
solutions and black holes. with increasing horizon radius xh, the transition occurs for decreasing values of b.
extrapolating the curves of fig. 2 to atr = 1.5, we nd btr  24 for xh = 0.01 and btr  15 for xh = 0.1 [9].

4

finally, in fig. 6 we present x/x0 as a function of the horizon radius xh for b = 12.5, b = 21.125, b = 32 and
b = 50. for b = 12.5 and b = 21.125 the monopole solutions show rn-type behaviour. this behaviour extends to
the black hole solutions for b = 12.5 up to xh  0.17 and for b = 21.125 up to xh  0.07. the precise transition
value must be extrapolated [10]. for larger values of xh na-type behaviour arises. for b = 32 and b = 50 regular
and black holes solutions show na-type behaviour. (for b = 105 and xh = 0.1 only the second minimum is left,
as compared to b  400 for the regular solutions [4].) for larger values of b and horizon radius xh > 0.3 the
analysis of black holes solutions needs special consideration [3].

v. conclusion

for gravitating monopoles and non-abelian black holes we have studied numerically the transition between
the low and the high higgs mass regime. considering the approach of the solutions towards a limiting critical
solution, the low higgs mass regime shows rn-type behaviour, i.e. the critical solution where a horizon rst
appears corresponds to an extremal rn solution outside the horizon, while it is non-singular inside. in contrast,
the high higgs mass regime shows na-type behaviour, i.e. the critical solution is an extremal black hole with non-
abelian hair. in particular, analytical analysis suggests that rn-type behaviour should not occur for a < atr = 1.5
corresponding to b > btr  25.6 [4].

our numerical analysis indicates two main results:

 for asymptotically at gravitating monopoles na-type behaviour is still present at b = 30, considerably
below the numerical value given by lue and weinberg [4]. we strongly expect that the na-type behaviour
persists until the analytical transition value is reached. but our numerical accuracy is insucient to show
this other than by extrapolation.

 the analogous phenomenon occurs for black hole solutions. here with increasing values of the horizon

radius xh, the transition occurs for decreasing values of b.

vi. appendix

we employ a collocation method for boundary-value ordinary dierential equations developed by ascher, chris-
tiansen and russell [11]. the set of non-linear coupled dierential equations eqs. (10) -(13) is solved using the
damped newton method of quasi-linearization. at each iteration step a linearized problem is solved by using a
spline collocation at gaussian points. since the newton method works very well, when the initial approximate
solution is close to the true solution, the gravitating monopole solutions for varying parameters a and b are
obtained by continuation.

the linearized problem is solved on a sequence of meshes until the required accuracy is reached. for a particular
mesh xi = x1 < x2 < ... < xn +1 = xo, where xi and xo are the boundaries of the interval, and hi = xi+1  xi, h =
max1in hi, a collocation solution ~v (x) = (v1, v2, ...vd) is determined. each component vn(x)  cmn1[xi, xo],
is a polynomial of degree smaller than k + mn, where mn is the order of the n-th equation, and k is an integer
bigger than the highest order of any of the dierential equations. the collocation solution is required to satisfy
the set of dierential equations at the k gauss-legendre points in each subinterval as well as the set of boundary
conditions.

when approximating the true solution un(x) by the collocation solution vn(x), an error estimate in each

subinterval x  [xi, xi+1) is obtained from the expression
n (x)||(i) = cn,l|u(k+mn)

n (x)  v(l)

||u(l)

n

(xi)|hk+mnl

i

+ o(hk+mn l+1)

l = 0, ...., mn  1 , n = 1, ..., d ,

(23)

(24)

where cn,l are known constants. also, using eq. (24) a redistribution of the mesh points is performed to roughly
equidistribute the error. with this adaptive mesh selection procedure, the equations are solved on a sequence of

5

meshes until the successful stopping criterion is reached, where the deviation of the collocation solution from the
true solution is below a prescribed error tolerance [11].

for the gravitating monopole solutions, we typically specied the error tolerance in the range 104  106, but
the absolute errors of the collocation solutions normally turned out to be far better, e.g. in the range 1071012.
the number of mesh points used in these calculations was typically about 350, with nearly 70% of the mesh points
in the critical region of the two minima of n (x), if present.

we calculated the solutions on the nite interval [0, xo] with xo ranging from 10 to 104. the solutions are
highly independent of the size of the interval, as seen in fig. 7, where the metric function n (x) is shown for the
parameters a = 1.43596, b = 36.125 and three value of xo. indeed, as specied by their boundary conditions
eqs. (17)-(18), the gravitating monopole solutions are asymptotically at.

in fig. 5, where the evolution of the two minima of the metric function n (x) is shown for b = 36.125, the

corresponding global error estimates for the function n (x) are also shown.

for the black hole solutions the set of boundary conditions eqs. (20)-(22) is employed, and the calculations are
performed on an interval [xh, xo], where xh represents the horizon of the black hole. the error tolerances and the
errors are comparable to those of the gravitating monopole solutions.
