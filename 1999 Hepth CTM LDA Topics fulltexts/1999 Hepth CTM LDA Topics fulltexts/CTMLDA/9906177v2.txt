following the papapetrou-dixon-wald procedure we derive the equation of motion for a dilatonic

test body(probe) with the dilaton coupling  = pp/(2 + p) in four dimension. since the dilatonic

freedom sometimes comes from extra dimensions, it is best to derive the eom by a dimensional

reduction from (p + 4)dimensions. we discuss about the force balance up to the gravitational

spin-spin interactions via the probe technique. the force balance condition yields the saturation of

a bogomolnyi bound and the gyromagnetic ratio of the test body.

i. introduction

bps solitons are an important object and has comprehensive features from the view points of superstring theory

and black hole physics. great interest is its force cancellation. by its virtue multi-soliton solution can exist and the

existence helps us to construct new solutions which might be related to a string state. the simplest example is the

majumdar-papapetrou(mp) solution [1] in general relativity or n = 2 supergravity [2]. what we should do in order

to check the force balance is to investigate the motion of a charged test body on an isolated soliton, for example, an

extremal reissner-nordstrom solution. we should observe that the electrostatic repulsive force is balanced by the

gravitational attractive one when q = m.

it is, however, natural to consider rotating solitons in general case.

it is well known that the israel-wilson-

perjes(iwp) solution [3] is stationary one which becomes the mp solution at the static limit. the balance between

the gravitational spin-spin interaction and magnetic dipole-dipole force was conrmed by using a spinning test body

[4]. the gyromagnetic ratio turns out to be g = 2 which is same with the kerr solution. since the body has the spin

it does not follow geodesic motion. unfortunately, the isw solution is not extreme and has naked singularities except

in the static limit [5].

in the heterotic string theory on a torus, similar ddimensional stationary charged solution has been found
through o(d 1, d 1) transformation from an uncharged kerr solution [6] [7]. for d > 5 the extreme limit saturates
a bogomolnyi bound without naked singularities and then we can obtain a regular multi-soliton solution [6]. here we

remind you that the extreme limit of non-dilatonic kerr solution does not exists for even d > 5. but now the solution

contains the dilaton sector and the situation is changed. we also be able to obtain a four dimensional solution by

taking doubly periodic arrays of extremal black holes in six dimensions. thus it is worth to study the force balance

in dilatonic or stringy multi-black hole systems.

in this paper, as a rst step, we derive the equation of motion for a dilatonic test body with the dilaton coupling

 = pp/(2 + p) in four dimension. this theory can be easily obtained from the dimensional reduction of (p + 4)-

dimensional maxwell-einstein theory. the motion and force balance of a test body without any moments, i.e. test

particle, has been investigated in ref. [8].

the rest of this paper is organised as follows. in sec. ii we briey review the papapetrou-dixon-wald procedure

[9] [10] [11] in higher dimensions and give the equation of motion for a test body. in sec. iii, we rewrite the above

formal equation in terms of four dimensions and discuss about the force balance up to the gravitational spin-spin

interaction and give the force balance condition. it is well known that the force balance between the gravitational,

dilatonic and electrostatic forces yields the saturation of the bogomolnyi bound. moreover the condition supplies the

gyromagnetic ratio of the test body balancing with the central soliton. finally we give summary and discussion in

sec. iv.

ii. equation of motion

the (p + 4)-dimensional einstein-maxwell theory gives the einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory with the coupling

 = pp/(p + 2) in four dimension. we follow the argument given in ref. [12]. let the metric gmn of (p + 4)-

dimensional space-time to be

ds2

4+p = gmn dxm dxn = e2gdxdx + e2(1)(d2

1 +  + d2
p),

(2.1)

where  = pp/(p + 2) and  is a scalar function of {x}. the geek indices runs from 0 to 3. as you can easily see,

the einstein-hilbert action in (p + 4)-dimension yields

s =

1

16g z d4xg[rg  2()2  e2f 2]

(2.2)

in terms of four dimension. here rg is the ricci scalar of the metric g .

following the papapetrou-dixon-wald procedure [9] [10] [11], we can instantly written down the equation of motion

from the conservation low of the energy-momentum tensor in higher dimension, m tmn = 0. the result is as follows,

vmm pn =

sijn fij

vmm sij = 2p[ivj] +

gq
2m

sm[j f i]
m ,

(2.3)

(2.4)

where g is the gyromagnetic ratio of the spinning test body. pm and vm are mmomentum and mvelocity of a test
body which has mass m, charge q and angular momentum tensor smn . in the above we imposed the supplementary

condition on the test body,

pm smn = 0

(2.5)

which determines the motion of the test body and species the center of mass [11]. we nd the fact that pm is not

always proportional to vm because of the existence of spin. in fact the relation turns out in the form

vm = fhpm

(2.6)

where f = (vm pm )/(pn pn ). however, pm  vm if one ignores the higher order terms at the spacelike asymptote.
from eq. (2.3) we obtain

where

vmm q =

smn fmn

q = (pm + qam )m +

smnn m .

(2.7)

(2.8)

hence q is conserved if fmn = 0 holds. the condition fmn = 0 holds on the stationary exact solution.

as a next step we will rewrite the above equation in terms of four dimension. we will do that for examples given

in the next section.

iii. force balance

the force balance between solitons is important features because it guarantees the existence of multi-soliton and

this gives a new black hole solution by taking some periodic arrays of solitons which might be related to a string state.

first of all we derive the equation of motion for a test body without spin on a static charged dilatonic solution [13].

a. non-rotating case

in this case we can take sij = 0 and the equation of motion is simply given by the geodesic motion in (p + 4)-

dimension;

d
d

pm = n

mi vm pi + qf n

i vi .

(3.1)

here we are interest in the motion in four dimensional space-time and it is natural to assume that the extra dimensions

components of the velocity vm vanish. from eq. (2.6) we see that pm is proportional to vm ;

p = pi i = p = f 1v,

where v = dz( )/d and g(v, v) = 1. from the above equation of motion

vmm (pi pi ) =  (f 2e2) = 0

holds. then f  e and

pi = mevi .

(3.4)

after arranging of several terms we obtain the nal form as

v(ev ) +  e =

q

f 
 v.

this equation is also derived from the variational principle of the action given by [8];

s4 = z dhmre2g

the metric, vector potential and dilation eld of the static black hole solution for the action (2.2) are given by [13]

r are related to the adm mass and total charge as follows,

the potential exactly vanishes, that is, v (r) = 0 for arbitrary r. in the dilatonic gravity theory, the bogomolnyi

type bound(m  (1 + 2)1/2|q|) has been proven [14]. so we realise again that the extreme limit saturates the
bogomolnyi bound. we also be able to check the force balance from the equation of motion directly. for simplicity,

hereafter, we take the extreme limit. the metric is written as

ds2 = gdxdx = v (r)1dt2 + v (r)dx2,

where v (r) = (1 + r+/r)2/(1+2) = (1 + r+/r)(p+2)/(p+1) and r = r  r+ = pijx ix j. then

r3 . this tells us the cancellation between the gravitational,

dilatonic and electrostatic forces.

we remember that the above extreme dilatonic solution with odd p can be derived from dense arrays of innite

multi-black holes solution with the same mass along the -direction in the (p + 4)-dimensional einstein-maxwell

theory [15]. the metric of multi-black holes solution is given by

ds2

4+p = u 2dt2 + u 2/(p+1)dx2 + u 2/(p+1)(d2

1 +  + d2
p),

where u = 1 +pp

i=1 mi/(|~x  ~xi|p+1 + |~  ~i|p+1). the dense arrays along ps  direction leads us

u = 1 +

p

xi=1



|~x|p+1 + |~  ~i|p+1 = 1 +

m
r

.

note that the metric (3.20) can be written as

ds2

4+p = u p/(1+p)hu (p+2)/(p+1)dt2 + u (p+2)/(p+1)dx2i + u 2/(p+1)(d2

1 +  + d2
p)

= u p/(1+p)g dxdx + u 2/(p+1)(d2

1 +  + d2
p).

this is black p-brane. thus the motion of test body is equivalent with the geodesic motion for perpendicular direction

to the surface where arrays(black p-brane) are.

b. rotating case

for purpose of this paper it is enough to pick up the rst order of the angular momentum (slow rotating approxi-

mation). the general solution is given by [16]

ds2 =

(3.23)

(3.24)

(3.25)

as, at rst sight, the function f (r) seems to have a bad behaviour at p = 1, we will consider the case with p = 1

separately.

the apparent bad behaviour of the function f (r) does not yield any troubles and we obtain the expression

f (r) = (cid:16)1

(3.33)

as we see in the previous subsection, monopole components are balanced by each other when q = 2m/3 and
q = 2m/3. then the balance between the above forces holds when the gyromagnetic ratio is g = 5/3.

next we consider cases with p 6= 1. the metric and vector potential are approximately given by

ds2 =

(3.36)

then the balance between the above forces holds when the gyromagnetic ratio is g = 2(3+2)

3(1+2) . here we realise that

the previous value of the gyromagnetic ratio in the case with p = 1 can be combined to the present expression. it is

remarkable that the value is dierent from that of the background space-time. according to ref. [16], the background

space-time has g = 6

3+2 . that is, the test body is not like the background space-time. the discrepancy indicates the

non-existence of spinning multi-soliton solutions in the einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory. if and only if  = p = 0, all

gyromagnetic ratios are same as g = 2 and the exact iwp solutions exists as we expect.

8

iv. summary and discussion

in this paper we derived the equation of motion for a spinning charged dilatonic probe(test body) by using the

paparetrou-dixon-wald procedure and discuss about the force balance. we found that the force balance holds up to

the spin-spin interaction when |q| = 1 + 2m , |q| = 1 + 2m and the gyromagnetic ratio g = 2(3+2)

3(1+2) . the former

condition saturates the bogomolnyi bound and its fact was well known. on the other hand, the latter condition has

a discrepancy with the value of the background space-times except in the p = 0 case. this fact might mean that the

einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory does not have the exact spinning multi-soliton solutions. we are aware of the multi-

soliton solution in n = 4, d = 4 supergravity [17] or heterotic string theory [6] [7]. in those theory the additional

ingredient is the three form eld h which can be expressed by the axion eld, a, so that h = e4a

in four dimension. hence, the resolution to the discrepancy may be essential to investigate the force balance in so

called einstein-maxwell-dilaton-axion theory. the investigation on the stringy probe, that is, test body with the

moment associated to the three form eld might be important and will be reported in the next study [18]. in this

paper our consideration was concentrated on the bosonic sector. obviously, the deeper investigation of the fermion

sector is also great interest although we can expect a parallel issue naively.
