abstract

the classication of the regularization ambiguity of 2d fermionic deter-

minant in three dierent classes according to the number of second-class

constraints, including the new faddeevian regularization, is examined and

extended. we found a new and important result that the faddeevian class,

with three second-class constraints, possess a free continuous one param-

eter family of elements. the criterion of unitarity restricts the parameter

to the same range found earlier by jackiw and rajaraman for the two-

constraints class. we studied the restriction imposed by the interference

of right-left modes of the chiral schwinger model (qed2) using stones
soldering formalism. the interference eects between right and left movers,

producing the massive vectorial photon, are shown to constrain the regular-

ization parameter to belong to the four-constraints class which is the only

non-ambiguous class with a unique regularization parameter.

i. introduction

it is often claimed that chiral interaction of two-dimensional fermionic gauge models
poses an obstruction to gauge symmetry. in this paper we clarify several aspects of this
question for dierent regularizations of the chiral fermionic determinant, including the
new faddeevian regularization case proposed by mitra [1], under the point of view of the
stones soldering formalism [2]. it is worth mentioning that understanding the properties
of 2d fermionic actions is crucial in several aspects. for instance, the 1-cocycle necessary
in recent discussions on smooth functional bosonization [3,4], which is just the expression
of the 2d anomaly, is known to be the origin of higher dimensional anomalies through a
set of descent equations [5]. incidentally, the anomaly phenomenon still dees a complete
explanation.

this paper is devoted to analyze and explore the restrictions that the soldering mech-
anism [2,68] imposes over the regularization ambiguity of 2d chiral fermionic determi-
nants. the soldering technique that is dimensionally independent and designed to work
with dual manifestations of some symmetry is well suited to deal with the chiral character
of 2d anomalous gauge theories. recently [9] a new interpretation for the phenomenon
of dynamical mass generation known as schwinger mechanism [10], has been proposed
which explores the ability of the soldering formalism to embrace interference eects. in
that study the interference of right and left gauged floreanini-jackiw chiral bosons [11]
was shown to lead to a massive vectorial mode, for the special case where the jackiw-
rajaraman (jr) regularization parameter is a = 1 [12] [13].

after the discovery that the qed2 could be consistently quantized if the regular-
ization ambiguity were properly taken into account, the investigation on this subject has
received considerable attention and emphasis [14] [15]. the quantization of the model was
considered from dierent points of view, both canonical and functional and the spectrum
and unitarity was analyzed by distinct techniques, including the gauge invariant wess-
zumino formulation [16], with results consistent with ref. [12]. despite this spate of
interest, a surprising new result was reported recently by mitra [1] showing that a dier-
ent regularization prescription was yet possible, leading to new consequences. he proposed
a new (faddeevian) regularization class, materialized by a unique and conveniently chosen
mass term leading to a canonical description with three constraints. recall that in [12]
and [13], the hamiltonian framework was structured in terms of two classes with two
(a > 1) and four (a = 1) second-class constraints respectively. mitras work brings a clear
interpretation for the reasons leading the bosonization ambiguity to t into three instead
of two distinct classes, classied according to the number of constraints present in the

2

model.

it is the main goal of this paper to study the restrictions posed by the soldering
formalism over this new regularization class. since soldering has ruled out the two-
constraint class solution of jackiw-rajaraman as being able to dynamically generate mass
via right-left interference, we are led to ask if the new faddeevian class of chiral bosons
proposed by mitra do interfere constructively to produce a massive vectorial mode. to
nd an answer to this question we review, in section 2, the procedure of [17] to obtain the
multi-parametric regularization eective action based on the pauli-villars regularization
proposed in [18]. this eective action is the point of departure for an extention of the
ambit of ref. [1] that is needed to our purpose in this paper and to be developed in
section 3. the bosonised theory satisfying faddeevs structure for the constraint algebra
is studied in the canonical approach. the mass of the photon scalar eld is computed
and its dependence on the ambiguity parameter is shown to be tantamount to that in
ref. [12]; the massless sector however is more constrained than its counterpart in [12],
corroborating the results of [1]. the restrictions imposed by the soldering are worked
out in section 4. we nd the striking new result that the interference eects lift the
parameter dependence by discriminating the value of the only non ambiguous class. our
results give a clear interpretation for the schwinger mechanism as a left-right interference
phenomenon, as suggested by jackiw [5]. our ndings are further discussed in the nal
section.

ii. the effective action

in a gauge invariant theory, free of anomalies, the canonical description reveals a couple
of rst-class constraints, with the gauss law g(x) appearing as the secondary constraint
for the momentum 0(x) corresponding to the scalar potential a0(x). in an anomalous
gauge theory, on the contrary, gauge invariance is lost and the constraint algebra for the
gauge generator becomes aicted by the presence of a schwinger term

[g(x), 0(y)] = 0
[g(x), g(y)] =  hc (x  y),

(1)

where c is some constant. this structure introduces extra degrees of freedom into the
quantum theory as argued by faddeev [19]. the quantum chiral schwinger model with
the usual regularization (a  1) does have more degrees of freedom than its classical coun-
terparts, as expected, but does not t into faddeevs scheme above due to the functional

3

dependence of the gauss generator on the scalar potential, which leads to a dierent
constraint algebra than (1),

[g(x), 0(y)] 6= 0
[g(x), g(y)] = 0.

(2)

the second-class nature of the set is then due to the non-commutative character of the
primary and secondary constraints.

the new regularization class for the fermionic determinant proposed by mitra has
the virtue of tting perfectly into faddeevs picture. in this section we shall review the
computation of the fermionic determinant leading to this new scheme. our starting point
is the action for fermionic sector of the chiral schwinger model,

s = z d2x (x) hi/  q  a/(x) (1 + i 5)i (x)

(3)

where (x) is a fermionic eld and a is the vector gauge eld in a (1 + 1) dimensional
spacetime. from this classical action we obtain the following eective action [18]

exp i s(0)

ef f [a(x)] = z d(x) d (x) exp i sh (x), (x), a(x)i .

in a formal level this is a nonlocal action that reads,

exp i s(0)

ef f [a(x)] = q2 z d2x a(x) ( + )


2

(  ) a(x),

(4)

(5)

but there is an ambiguity related to the regularization procedure adopted. let us discuss
the regularization procedure proposed by frolov and slavnov [18]. to this end we add a
multi-parametric regularising action

sreg[a(x)] =

where

2n1

xr=1 z d2x r(x) hi /  mr  q  a(x) 

ri r(x)


r = [ar k  (1 + i5) + br  (1  i5)] .

(6)

(7)

here r(x) are the regulators elds with mass mr whose couplings 
r (or k  and )
are matrices which will be determined later. these regulators bring up the following
partition function

exp i sef f

reg [a] = z r d(x) d (x) exp i sregh r(x), (x)r, a(x)i

jackiw and rajaraman found a regularized solution with a diagonal choice for the matrix

m  =   a 0

(15)

with a  0, corresponding to the cases with two and four-constraints classes. the physical
content of these cases, as disclosed by them, was found to correspond to an a-dependent
massive photon eld and a massless fermion for the former, while in the later the photon
eld was absent. mitra noticed that the alternative choice

m  =   1 1

1 3! (x  y),

(16)

leads to a new class of solutions with three second-class constraints and found that the
physical spectrum of the model contains a chiral fermion and a photon eld with mass
m = 4 q2. to work out the soldering formalism and obtain the interference contribution
coming from the chiral fermions we need to generalize the regularization dependence of
the eective action. this is done in the next section.

iii. hamiltonian analysis and spectrum

in their seminal work jackiw and rajaraman [12] showed that the qed2 could be
consistently quantized by including the bosonization ambiguity parameter satisfying the
condition a  1 to avoid tachyonic excitations. later on, working out the canonical
structure of the model, rajaraman [13] showed that the cases a > 1 and a = 1 belonged
to distinct classes: the a = 1 case represents the four-constraints class, while the a > 1
class presents only two constraints. the latter is a continuous one-parameter class, while
the former class is non ambiguous containing only one representative. the consequences
of these distinct constraint structures are that the a > 1 class presents, besides the
massless excitation also a massive scalar excitation (m2 = e2a2
a1 ) that is not found on
the other case. in the canonical approach the commutator between the primary and the
secondary constraints vanishes in the rst case. the emergence of two more constraints
completes the second-class set. mitra found the amazing fact that with an appropriated
choice of the regularization mass term it is possible to close the second-class algebra with
only three constraints. his model is not manifestly lorentz invariant, but the poincare
generators have been constructed [1] and shown to close the relativistic algebra on-shell.
the main feature of this new regularization is the presence of a schwinger term in the
poisson bracket algebra of the gauss law, which limits the set to only three second-class
constraints. to see this let us write the csm lagrangian, with faddeevian regularization
but with mitras regulator properly generalized to meet our purposes,

l =

(17)

where f = a  a; g = diag(+1,1) and 01 = 10 = 10 = 1. b is a chirality
parameter, which can assume the values b = 1. the mass-term matrix m is dened
as

m  =   1 

 ! (x  y).

(18)

notice that we have chosen unity coecient for a2
0 term. in a sense, this choice resem-
bles rajaramans a = 1 class and is the trademark of the faddeevian regularization. in
fact, rajaramans class is a singular point in the space of parameters. its canonical
description has the maximum number of constraints with no massive excitation. such a
case is found in (17) if we make  = 0 in (18). the appearance of a new class needs a non
vanishing value for . with mitras choice,  = 1 and  = 3, the photon becomes
massive (m2 = 4 q2), but the remaining massless fermion has a denite chirality, opposite
to that entering the interaction with the electromagnetic eld. this choice is, however,
too restrictive and may be relaxed leading to new and interesting consequences. in this
work the coecients  and  are in principle arbitrary, but the mass spectrum will impose
a constraint between them. this is best seen in the hamiltonian formalism.

possessing two or four second-class constraints. to perform quantization we compute the

which relates  and  and shows that the regularization ambiguity adopted in [1] can
be extended to a continuous one-parameter class (for a chosen chirality). we have, using
(27) and (28), the following mass formula for the massive excitation of the spectrum,

m2 = q2 (1 + b )2

.

(29)

note that to avoid tachyonic excitations,  is further restricted to satisfy b  = ||, so
   interchanges from one chirality to another. observe that in the limit   0 the
massive excitation becomes innitely heavy and decouples from the spectrum. this leads
us back to the four-constraints class. it is interesting to see that the redenition of the
parameter as a = 1 + || leads to,

m2 =

q2a2
a  1

which is the celebrate mass formula of the chiral schwinger model, showing that the
parameter dependence of the mass spectrum is tantamount to both the jackiw-rajaraman
and the faddeevian regularizations.

let us next discuss the massless sector of the spectrum. to disclose the presence of the
chiral excitation we need to diagonalize the reduced hamiltonian (23). this procedure
may, at least in principle, impose further restrictions over . this all boils down to nd
the correct linear combination of the elds leading to the free chiral equation of motion.
to this end we substitute 1 from its denition and a1 from the klein-gordon equation

(33)

this eld redenition, dierently from the case of the massive eld whose construction
imposed condition (28), does not restrain the parameter  any further. using (20) and

9

(32), all the elds can be expressed as functions of the free massive scalar a1 and the
free chiral boson , interpreted as the bosonized weyl fermion. the main result of this
section is now complete, i.e., the construction of the one-parameter class regularization
generalizing mitras proposal. the stage is now set to study the interference of chiral
actions with (one-parameter) faddeevian regularization.

iv. effects of interference

in this section we use the soldering formalism introduced in [2] to examine the restric-
tion imposed by chiral interference over the regularization ambiguity parameter when the
faddeevian approach is adopted. this study, taken in the framework of the usual jr
regularization, establishes a strong restriction over the parameters values and gives rise
to a new interpretation for the mechanism of dynamical mass generation occurring in
the schwinger model. this study is meaningful and necessary since a new class of theo-
ries with three second-class constraints has emerged: it must be veried if new solutions
resulting from interference will lead to a gauge invariant massive excitation. to begin
with, let us rewrite explicitly the two chiral actions presented in (17) in the appropriate
light-cone variables,

l+ = +  +

(a+  +a)2 + 2 q  a+  2 q2 || a2

 +

l = +  +

+ +

1
2

2

+ q2 (1 + ||) aa+

+ q2 (1 + | |) aa+ ,

(34)

(35)

where we have used the convention l = l|b. for clarity, we have used dierent elds
(, ) for opposite chiralities and the corresponding mass-term parameters (, ) to make
clear that these chiral theories are uncorrelated. however by making use of soldering
formalism we will get a meaningful combination of these components.

the main point of soldering is to lift the global nother symmetry of each chiral com-
ponent to a local symmetry of the system as a whole. showing only the main parts of the
soldering formalism we can see that the axial transformation ( =  = ) leads to

l+ =  j+()
l = + j()

(36)

where j() = 2( + qa) and j+() = 2(+ + qa+) are the noethers currents and
 is the gauge parameter. next we introduce the soldering eld b appropriately coupled
to the noether currents to obtain the once iterated chiral actions as,

10

l(0)
+  l(1)
l(0)
  l(1)

+ = l(0)
 = l(0)

+ + b+ j()

 + b j+() .

(37)

the soldering elds act as partial compensators for the variance (36), transforming vec-
torially under the axial symmetry, b = . it is now possible to dene an eective
lagrangian invariant under the combined transformation of the chiral elds and compen-
sators as,

lef f = l1

+ + l1

 + 2 b+ b .

(38)

the soldered action is obtained using the fact that b are auxiliary elds. their elimi-
nation may be done altogether from their eld equations but the eects of soldering will
persist as a residual symmetry for the remaining elds. this will naturally cohere the
otherwise independent chiral elds  and  in the form of a soldered lagrangian for a
collective eld  as,

lef f = +     2 q (a+    a + ) +

+

q2

2 h a2

+   a2

  (  ) a+ ai

1
2

(+a  a+)2

(39)

where  =   . notice that except for the last term, the soldered action describes
the massive gauge invariant bosonised version of the schwinger model, with the gauge
invariant collective eld  playing the role the of the photon eld. gauge invariance
imposes a strong constraint over the parameters as,

 =  = 0.

(40)

this value corresponds to the a = 1, four-constraints regularization class. this is a
remarkable result, consistent with [9].

a notable feature of the present analysis is the disclosure of a new class of parameter-
izations and their dependence with the number of constraints. dierent aspects of this
feature were elaborated and the consequences of interference computed. to discuss further
the implications of interference on chiral actions it is best to compare with the existing
literature. this also serves to put the present work in a proper perspective. to be precise,
it was initialy shown that in the faddeevian approach there are actually three second-class
constraints with a real parameter dependence. to disclose this one-parameter dependence
of the faddeevian regularization is a new interesting result. the counting of constraints
explains the presence of only one chiral excitation in the spectrum (besides the massive

11

mode). this is in contrast with the usual jr regularization where the massless excitation
is scalar, and is essentially tied to the fact that this regularization is less constrained.

the restrictions of soldering however conne the appearance of a massive vector excita-
tion to the interference of modes belonging to the a = 1 class that, being more constrained,
has only a massless scalar in the spectrum. this might raise questions about the inter-
ference of the chiral modes in this class. it should be noticed however that the use of
light-cone variables in the soldering constrains even further these chiral actions. both the
two and the four-constraints classes display chiral excitations instead of massless scalars.
the original chiral mode of the mitras class therefore disappear in the presence of the
extra light-cone constraint and there appears to exist an ambiguity challenging the real
meaning of the soldering. in fact there are no massless particles in the spectrum of (34-35)
for the light-cone setting. however, what is important to observe in this scenario is that
the whole process of soldering is done in the lagrangian framework, such that the limit
a  1 is well dened. this is also valid for the jr regularization. the limit leads to
the a = 1 action and the canonical analysis may be done unambiguously. oppositely, the
hamiltonian formulation has the a = 1 point as a singularity, as shown in (22).

v. conclusions

in this work we studied the bosonized form of the csm fermionic determinant adopting
the three-constraints regularization parameterized by a single real number. this extends
early regularizations proposed by jr and mitra. our results display a clear-cut separation
of the existing classes shown to depend only on the number of second-class constraints.
the new class with faddeevian regularization and three second-class constraints has been
worked out in great detail. the spectrum has been shown to consist of a chiral boson and
a massive photon eld. the mass formula for the scalar excitation was shown to reproduce
the jr result. considerations of unitarity therefore restrain the range of the regularization
parameter similarly. the use of the soldering formalism supplemented by gauge invariance
restricts the otherwise arbitrary ambiguity parameter to the specic value a = 1, which
corresponds to the four-constraints class. this is new result that discriminates the special
character of this unambiguous regularization point and gives a precise interpretation of
the schwinger dynamical mass generation mechanism as a consequence of right and left
interference.

to conclude we stress that the formalism and analysis proposed here illuminates the
close connection among anomalous gauge theories, the interference phenomenon and the
mechanism of dynamical mass generation, providing a variety of new possibilities with

12

practical applications.
