the gluing of vertices in string field theory and in particular in the
case of closed strings, is at the basis of the construction of a perturbative
approach to the theory. the proof of various properties such as associativity,
gauge invariance of the action, etc., makes use of such gluing of vertices. to
tackle the problem, peskin, le clair and preitchschopf [1] have developed
and proved a theorem which shows how to construct a given vertex starting
from an elementary one.
in principle, one could start from the simplest
vertex with three strings and generate vertices for any number of strings.
with some precisions about the integration over the modular space it will
give the starting point to build a eld theory for closed strings with only one
term, namely, the three strings vertex which appropriately will generate the
innite non-polynomial action [2].

in the proof of the theorem in [1], the authors use the riemann surfaces
with holes representation of vertices to show that the contraction of legs in
dierent vertices (which can be represented by the bpz inner product [3])
gives another vertex representation the riemann surface arising from sewing
two surfaces around the hole boundaries.

moreover, it has been suggested in [4, 5] that the scattering amplitude
of n strings, at any order in perturbation theory can be interpreted as the
gluing of elementary vertices. in this approach to the eld theory proposed
by witten [6], the propagator between vertices is simulated by the joining
of intermediate strings in all possible parameterizations. this requires the
formulation of the theory in terms of the left and right hand pieces of the
string.

following this suggestion we prove the gluing theorem using the operator
approach (to string vertices) developed in [7], in which strings are expanded
using left and right degrees of freedom and the neumann functions are written
in terms of innite dimensional matrices. these matrices are just the ones
appearing in the canonical transformation from the usual self-energy fock
space operators to the ones splitting left and right degrees of freedoms as
mentioned above.

using general properties of these matrices, the proof of the theorem sim-
plies. one can then explicitly generate the neumann function of the n-
strings vertex starting from the 3-strings vertex appearing in the open string
field action. in closed strings, in order to get the non-polynomial expan-
sion, one needs to know how to contract the restricted vertex interaction
[2]. following [4] where the closed string interaction is interpreted as the

2

reparametrization of the string, it appears to be possible [8] to perform a
generalization of the gluing of vertices (which gives just a point in the mod-
ular space) to the gluing of parametrized vertices covering a region of the
modular space.

the organization of this note is as follows. first we review the form
of the vertex when the midpoint string interaction is explicitly considered.
then we briey state the gluing theorem of [1]. the proof of the theorem
for arbitrary vertices is sketched, and the relevant steps, in the case of the
gluing of two vertices with 3 strings to give the one with four (3 + 3  4),
are discussed in some detail. we will see that in the critical dimension, the
ghost degrees of freedom cancel the determinant of the laplacian coming
from the gluing procedure, represented here as the determinant of an innite
dimensional matrix. finally we state our conclusions and future outlook.

when string elds are written in terms of half string oscillator modes,
the n-string vertex takes on a very elegant and simple form. in the spirit
of the original work of [6] in string field theory, the interaction vertex is
obtained by identifying oscillators referring to opposite halves of two adjacent
strings. it has been shown in [9] that the fourier components of the neumann
functions for the n-strings vertex can be written in terms of particular linear
combinations of the two innite dimensional matrices relating the half-string
degrees of freedom to the conventional hamiltonian eigenstates oscillator
modes. for the purpose of this work, this particular algebraic representation
of the neumann functions is very useful; the reason is, in order to prove the
theorem one needs to calculate explicitly the inverse of some combinations
of these matrices which have been calculated before [9] in its most general
form.

writing the n-strings vertex in an operator form, and splitting the ver-
tex into coordinate and ghost sector, we get for the coordinates degrees of
freedom

< vx(1    n)| = n

i=1  n
xi=1

ki! i < ki|vx(1    n).

(1)

the n momentum states i < ki| are eigenstates of the corresponding i-
0 and the vertex operator, written in terms of

string momentum operator a(i)
string creation and annihilation oscillator modes, is given by

one has for the ghost vertex a similar form to the matter vertex

q is the weight of the curvature term in the string action [10] and the states

notice that the ghost vertex diers from (2) in the ghost number quadratic

the discussion of both matter and ghost sectors can be carried out in
parallel. the additional terms appearing in the ghost part will contribute
in the critical dimension to the cancellation of the laplacian determinant
coming from the ghost and coordinate gluing. this point will be discussed
later. the complete vertex is given by the product of both pieces, the one
corresponding to the matter sector and that corresponding to the ghost,
namely

v (1,   , n) = vx(1,   , n)v(1,   , n).

the general form of the neumann coecients n r,s

n,m have been calculated
in many works [11], for our purpose it is convenient the representation given
in [9] since, for any vertex, they can be written in a compact form in a n-
dimensional space spanned by the n strings, as elements of n  n matrix.
for instance, one has for the terms which do not involve the zero modes

n r,s

even even = (in m t

1  s+m t

2 )1 (inm t

2  s+m t
 ),

n r,s
odd odd = s+  s

t (inm1  s+m2)1 m2s,

n r,s

odd even = s

t (inm1  s+m2)1

the remaining ones are of similar form and do not add anything new to these
expressions. in is the identity n-dimensional matrix, whereas the matrices
s+ and s are

(s+)ij = 1

2(1 + ij),

(s)ij = (1)i+1

2

(1  ij).

the innite dimensional matrices m1,2 give the canonical transformation
from the half string degrees of freedom to the conventional ones. explicitly
they have the form [4]

(m1)n,m = 2

(m2)n,m = 2

2m1(cid:17)1/2
 (cid:16) 2n

one can see that, after diagonalization of the s matrices, the problem of
computing the vertex itself, essentially reduces to calculating the inverse of
the matrix (m1  cos 2k
n m2) where k = 1, ..., n. details of the whole process
as well as the general form of this matrix and its inverse have been given in
ref. [9].

now, one can use this result in the proof of the gluing theorem [1]. the
theorem states that the contraction of two string vertices (e.g., for n and
n  strings), through the bpz inner product (which is nothing other than
the vertex overlapping two strings, < v (12)|), gives the (n + n   2)-string
vertex. more precisely, using the notation of vertices given in equations (1)
and (3), including ghost and matter sectors in the same bra, the result can
be cast

< v (1, ...n  1, a)| < v (n, ..., n + n   2, a)|v (a, a) >=

=< v (1, ..., n + n   2)|.

(8)

this means that we have contracted the two vertices by joining the strings
a and a in the rst and the second vertex respectively. of course, because
of the cyclic properties of the vertices, it is immaterial the position of these
strings.

in terms of the neumann representation of the vertex given in equations
(2) and (4), the theorem shows the identication of the coecients appearing
in v (1, ..., n + n   2) with particular combinations of the ones appearing in
v (1,   , n  1, a) and v (1,   , n   1, a). in particular, in the proof of the
theorem, and in the coordinate sector, one has to show the identications

(9)

where the indices si(s
i) run from 1 to n  1 (n to n  + n  2). the bold-
faced n represent the coecients of the resulting glued vertex according to
the index. the matrix en,m = ()(n+1)n,m(n, m  1) comes from the bpz
inner product that, in the language of vertices, is v (a, a). also, after the
contraction of the vertices with the bpz inner product [3], the determinant

6

of the laplacian appears. this amounts to a factor of the form

dx = [det(1  n aa

en a,ae)]d/2,

(10)

d being the space time dimension, this factor will cancel once the contribu-
tion from the ghost sector is included.

hence, the proof of the theorem relies on the calculation of the inverse ma-
trix (1  n a,aen a,a
e)1. due to the symmetries of the diagonal neumann
coecients there is no dependence on the indices a and a. the general form
of this inverse matrix can be obtained in full; the algebra involved is rather
tedious, and the result can be cast in terms of the matrix m 1
1 m2 = . for
instance, for an equal and even number of strings in each vertex, i.e. n = n 
even, one can show that

e)1 =

(1  n a,aen a,a
= 21  2 (1 + 1  2)(cid:16)1+1+2(cid:17)2n 2
(cid:18)(cid:16)1+12(cid:17)n

2n 2

n(cid:19)2 .

this formula is not at all illuminating, to illustrate the essential points
in the proof, we will work out in detail the particular case of the gluing of
two 3-string vertices to give the 4-string vertex. this vertex also appears
explicitly in the string field theory action [6] for open strings and, as it
was commented in the introduction, there is a possibility for generating the
non-polynomial string eld theory action using only this vertex.

more precisely we are interested in the relation

< v (1, 2, a)| < v (a, 3, 4)|v (a, a) >=< v (1, 2, 3, 4)|,

which, in the momentum basis, and restricting ourselves to the coordinates
degrees of freedom is written as:

i=1dki dka dka  (ka  k1  k2)  (ka  k3  k4)  (ka  ka)

r 4
< k1| < k2| < ka|vx(1, 2, a) < ka| < k3| < k4| vx(a, 3, 4) vx(a, a)|ka > |ka >
= r 4

i=1 ki(cid:17) < k1| < k2| < k3| < k4|vx(1, 2, 3, 4).

i=1dki (cid:16)p4

we focus our attention on the nonzero modes. in the coordinate sector,
when zero indices are involved, no diculties arise and the proof can be

7

carried out along the same lines, the additional linear term appearing in the
ghost vertex will be considered below. for the n = 3 vertex, one has for the
nonzero modes:

n r,r

1 + 1

even, even = 1

2(m t
2 m t
even, even =  1
even, even = n r,r2

n r,r1

2 )1m t

n r,r1

odd, odd = n r,r2
even, odd = n r,r

n r,r

2(m1 + 1

2 m2)1m2,

2 (m1 + 1
odd, odd =  1
odd, even = 0,
odd, even = n r,r2

n r,r1

even, odd = n r,r1

even, odd = n r,r2

odd, even = (m t

1 + 1

2 m t

2 )1.

in this case all the information is encoded in the inverse matrix given in

(9), namely

m 1 = (1  n aa

en a,ae)1,

(notice that this matrix is eectively independent of the indices because of
the symmetries of the neumann coecients).

to invert this matrix one needs only to make use of the properties of
the matrices m1,2 dictated by the fact that they dene a canonical trans-
formation in the string degrees of freedom [4]. in particular, they preserve
the commutation relations of the string creation and annihilation operators,
hence one has

2  m2m t

to be compared with the result given in [9] for the general vertex (we have ar-
ranged rows and columns according to the parity of the indices as in equation
(11)).

other terms relating the remaining neumann functions involve the same
sort of algebra and we will not insist on producing the calculation here. it
is important to remember that, in the process of contracting the oscillators
modes, the determinant term given in equation (10) appears, which will have
to be combined with terms coming from the ghost sector.

contraction of the oscillator modes in the ghost sector is performed using
the same techniques. in this case, however, because of the linear factor k s
n,
there are additional contributions proportional to the combinations of the
zero modes or, equivalently, to the total central charge q.

in fact, apart from the vertex operator of the glued vertex, one obtains
the above mentioned term which, combined with the determinant of the
laplacian from the coordinate sector (10) amounts to a factor

dxde

1

2 q2k,

(13)

k is given by a combination of the matrices (7) and the vector (6), whose
explicit form is not needed for our purpose, and the determinant of the
laplacian, the additional piece coming from the contraction of the ghost
operators using the bpz inner product now appears to the power 1
2

d = [det(1  n aa

en a,ae)]1/2

(14)

to proof that this factor (13) is equal to 1, we proceed in the follow-
ing way: rst consider the state generated by the moments of the energy-
momentum operator acting on the momentum and ghost number eigenstate

< a| =< k,q  q|exp

1

2 nann x

n,mam + n n 

n,mmo ,

9

(with an obvious notation for the neumann coecients) due to the fact that
the central charge of this operator is zero in d = 26 space-time dimensions
and q = 3, we have, on the sphere, the vanishing of all moments of it. in
the language of vertices this means

< a| < a|v (a, a)|ka > |ka >= 1 .

now, calculating explicitly the left hand side of the former relation, one

arrives to the identity

1 = dxde

1

2 q2k,

where k is the same contribution as the one appearing in (13), this derives
from the fact that the vector ~k r is independent of the string under consid-
eration, namely the value of r, thus the q and d dependence are the same
in both equations. the extra coecient in front of the glued vertex equals
one thus proving the validity of the theorem.

this result completes the proof of the theorem. other vertices can be
glued following these lines, however the calculational details are more in-
volved. this is easily seen in the form of equation (11).

now, we want to argue that the gluing theorem can be applied to calcu-
late actual string amplitudes. it has been shown in [4] that string amplitudes
themselves can be represented as the sum of contact string interactions in all
possible reparametrization of the strings. also in [5] it was shown that the
terms of the non-polynomial closed string action can be obtained as a sum
of string contact interactions, in a region of the reparametrization modular
space appropriate to reproduce the so called restricted polyhedra. with this
two ideas in mid, on can imagine the gluing of vertices in order to repro-
duce string amplitudes. for instance, starting with the three strings vertex
and applying the reparametrization operator () dened in [4] to each ver-
tex, one could envisage the construction of string amplitudes starting from
a generalization of the three string vertex. more precisely one has

< v (1, 2, a)| (i=1,2,a i) < v (a, 3, 4)| (i=a,3,4 i) |v (a, a) >=

< v (1, 2, 3, 4)| (i=1,...,4 i)

where we have, with the bpz inner product, glued two vertices taking all
possible reparametrization of the strings to give a four string vertex which,

10

in reference [4] was shown to reproduce the tree level string amplitudes for
both closed and open strings.

work in this directions is in progress and we hope to report on it in the
near future. this result will open the way to simplifying the construction of
amplitudes in the case of closed strings where in the non-polynomial theory
of [2] requires the addition of terms in every order of perturbation theory.

to summarize, in this note we have given an algebraic proof of the glu-
ing theorem of string vertices applied to the string field theory due to
witten [6]. we have used the representation of neumann functions given by
the half-string formulation of the theory and the problem is reduced to the
calculation of inverse matrices (of innite dimension). the introduction of
the reparametrization ghosts allows us to get rid of the determinant of the
laplacian coming from the operator contraction in the process of gluing. fi-
nally we outlook the possibility that the theorem, when applied to a suitable
generalization of the string vertices, can generate the open and closed string
amplitudes. this result will greatly simplify the construction of amplitudes
in the context of the non-polynomial string eld theory.
