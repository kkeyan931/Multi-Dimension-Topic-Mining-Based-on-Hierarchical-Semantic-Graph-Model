abstract

we consider small angle and large impact parameter high energy
scattering of colourless states in sym using the ads/cft correspon-
dence. the gauge theory scattering amplitude is linked with a corre-
lation function of tilted wilson loops, which can be calculated by the
exchange of bulk supergravity elds between the two corresponding
string worldsheets. we identify the dominant contributions, which all
correspond to real phase shifts. in particular, we nd a contribution
of the bulk graviton which gives an unexpected gravity-like s1 be-
haviour of the gauge theory phase shift in a specic range of energies
and (large) impact parameters.

1 introduction

the remarkable duality between supergravity (string theory) on ads
and supersymmetric gauge theory [1] has attracted much attention.
diverse phenomenae on both sides of the correspondence were inves-
tigated (see e.g. references in [2]).

1

in this paper we would like to consider the problem of high energy
scattering of massive colourless states, in the large s, large impact pa-
rameter regime (near forward scattering) in ym theory, and to study
it using the ads/cft correspondence. although no quantitative pre-
dictions are available for high energy scattering in strongly coupled
sym, there are some qualitative expectations (unitarity, constraints
on the s behaviour of amplitudes related to analyticity and crossing
properties) that should be satised, and which would be interesting to
investigate from the supergravity side. apart from that, in this regime
one observes a dierent hiearchy of importance of various supergravity
elds in comparision to e.g. static quantities like q q-q q potential [3].
another point is that here one expects the dominant contribution to
come just from the gluonic sector of the theory. the contribution of
fermions and scalars is expected to be subleading, and thus the results
may not be too closely tied to the n = 4 supersymmetry (see [4]).

where b is the impact parameter (in the following we will denote its
modulus by l).
in eld theory, there exists a spin-energy relation,
the exchange of elementary scalars gives rise to a phase shift behav-
ing like 1/s, vectors lead to s0 behaviour. the exchange of spin-2
particles (like gravitons) would on the other hand lead to a dramatic
rise s1. this last possibility is excluded in perturbative sym with
combinations of elementary vector, scalar and fermion exchanges1.

qualitatively one expects the same pattern of behaviour in the
ads/cft correspondence. the scattering amplitude will be seen to
correspond to a correlation function of two wilson loops, which can be
evaluated, on the supergravity side, as the exchange of (bulk) super-
gravity elds between the associated string worldsheets. we will show
that the same pattern of spin-energy behaviour persists here and, in
particular, that the graviton gives rise to the unexpected s1 depen-
dence in the real part of the amplitude. finally we will show that the
drukker-gross-ooguri legendre transform prescription [6] for wilson
loops does not modify this result.

1note, however, that a perturbative resummation at high energy can lead to the ex-

change of a compound state and a rise in the s dependence [5].

2

the plan of the paper is as follows. first we discuss general prop-
erties of scattering amplitudes and introduce the appropriate gauge
theory observable. then we make a passage to euclidean space and
apply the ads/cft correspondence. in section 5 we present calcu-
lations for various elds.
in section 6 we show that the legendre
transform prescription for wilson loops [6] does not change the main
results. finally we analyze the region of validity of our calculations
and discuss the results.

2 scattering amplitudes

quark-quark scattering amplitudes in the high energy limit (and small
momentum transfer) can be conveniently expressed, in the eikonal
approximation, in terms of a correlator of wilson lines [7, 8, 9]. the
high energy limit is reached when the lines move towards the light
cone. gauge invariance is restored (see e.g. [8]) by requiring that the
gauge transformations at both ends of the line are the same. we will
here pursue a dierent route [10] by substituting a wilson loop for
each of the wilson lines.

the role of the quarks in the ads/cft correspondence will be
played, as in [11], by the massive w bosons arising from breaking

correspondence to calculate (2). in order to avoid the complications of
lorentzian ads/cft correspondence [12] we will link, following [13],
this observable with a related observable in euclidean space.

3 analytical continuation to euclidean
time

in [13] a scattering amplitude with wilson lines was linked with an
analogous correlator of wilson lines in euclidean spacetime which
form an angle  (see gure 1). the parametrization of the wilson
lines is given by euclidean momenta

1 = (1, 0, 0)

2 = (cos , sin , x)
after performing the calculation one analytically continues

(5)

to obtain (2).

this claim was supported [13] by a number of explicit calculations
and a general argument based on the relation between correlators
of the gauge elds contracted with momenta both in euclidean and
minkowski space2. a similar link between scattering amplitudes of
branes and euclidean potentials between branes at angles [14] has
already been exploited (see ref. [15]).

as an example of this formalism we will consider, following [16], the
leading order perturbative qed amplitude. the wilson line correlator

2the same analytical continuation is expected to apply also to the wilson loop corre-

lators in the geometry we are considering.

ads supergravity approximation.

4 wilson loop at an angle 

the string worldsheet in ads space, corresponding to a wilson loop
c is obtained [11] by minimizing the nambu-goto action

z=c

(11)

where hab is the induced metric hab = g ax bx  , h = det hab is
its determinant and g = (1/z2) the ads metric. for the wilson

5

loop at an angle  (see gure 1) we choose the parametrization3   x,
t =  cos , y =  sin , z = z(x), where z is the 5th coordinate of ads5.
this leads to minimizing the action

5 wilson loop correlators

the wilson loop correlators can be computed following [3]. one has to
distinguish two cases [18]. when the transverse seperation l between
the loops is comparable with the transverse size a, there may exist
a connected minimal surface with the sum of the two loops as its
[19]). however when l  a the minimal
disjoint boundary (see e.g.
surface has two independent components and in order to calculate the
correlator one has to consider the supergravity interaction between
them as in [3]. this is the case we will consider here. the ads radius
is xed by convention to 1. then  = 1/4gsn and g2
y m = 2gs.
the coupling of the string worldsheet to the supergravity elds is

obtained by expanding the nambu-goto action

in this work we will explicitly consider the lightest relevant super-
gravity elds namely tachyonic scalar elds (see [20]) si , the dilaton

where g(x, x) is the relevant (bulk-bulk) greens function, and x and
x are points on the two worldsheets parametrized by t1, z and t2, w
(see gure 2). the factor 4 in the integrand takes into account the fact
that for each value of z there are two distinct points on the worldsheet,
and that we are performing calculations in the leading order in a/l
(here there is a subtlety related to the b eld which will be discussed
in detail later on).

we note that the exponent in (17) can be also interpreted as an
integral over one string worldsheet of the eld (x) produced by the
other worldsheet4 (with the suitable coupling sn g

where we also used the fact that by time invariance of the individual
minimal worldsheets the coupling does not depend on t1,2.

the  dependence (and thus the energy dependence) is encoded
completely in the coupling and the overall jacobian 1/ sin . the tensor
structure of the greens function and its specic dependence on the
ads invariant u (see below) gives rise to the a/l dependence of the
scattering amplitude. it does not inuence the  dependence. this
can be seen from the following considerations.

the greens function g(x, x) is constructed from the invariant

after performing the change of variables (19), we get

(22)

(23)

with no  dependence.

this argument can be extended also to the tensor structure of the
greens function. indeed apart from functions of u discussed above,
the greens function is constructed from the bitensors

u =

z (cid:20) (x  x)

w

 u0(cid:21)

(25)
where x and x are the two (5-dimensional) arguments of the greens
function, x=0  z and x

all these quantities do not involve .
therefore the energy () dependence can be read o directly from
the coupling coecients to the relevant elds. one has only to verify
that the appropriate greens function would not give a vanishing result
after integration in (20). let us now consider the contributions of the
relevant supergravity elds.

5.1 scalar exchange

using our conventions (16), the coupling of scalar modes si to the
string worldsheet was derived [3] to be

sn g
si
k

(26)

where the integer k  2. the scalar greens function has the form [3]

(27)

(for the si modes  = k). the leading dependence in a/l of (20) is
governed by the asymptotic large u behaviour of the greens function
(in this case const uk for large u). here and in the following we will
always restrict ourselves to calculations using this asymptotic part.
its contribution to (20) is

5.2 antisymmetric tensor exchange

the coupling of the antisymmetric b tensor eld follows from (15). it
is therefore given by

sn g
b

b = cos (bxt + zxbzt) + sin (bxy + zxbzy)

(39)

however the calculation of the phase shift is in this case more in-
volved [24]. in the ads5  s5 background the perturbations of the
ns-ns b eld mix with uctuations of the ramond-ramond 2-form
a. therefore we have to project the coupling (39) on to a coupling
with the (lowest) mass eigenstate aeig, which is (a real part of a) lin-
ear combination of a 2-form b and db, where  is the hodge dual.
therefore this state should couple [24] to the string through a linear
combination of the coupling (39) and the derivative coupling:

sn g
b 

g  

aeig


(40)

we will not determine here the appropriate coecients and normal-
ization but rather concentrate on isolating the a/l and s dependence
which is relevant for our analysis.

we will begin by considering the nonderivative coupling (39) with

the substitution b  aeig
the greens function g  should be constructed from the in-
variant bitensors and should be antisymmetric in both pairs of indices.
these requirements lead to the following tensor structures:



t b
1 = u  u  u u
t b
2 = u u u  uu u   uu u +

the greens function is then given6 for large u [24] to be

here we encounter the subtlety mentioned after formula (17). the
contraction of the greens function with the coupling (39) has to be
done with care, as there are a number of terms which are linear in the

there are two values of x corresponding to each z so we have in eect:

the leading energy dependence follows from the angular behaviour

(48)

this behaviour i coth  is exactly the same which appears in eld
theory with vector exchange (9).

let us now go back and consider the derivative coupling (40). by
the arguments in section 5 the leading  dependence will not change.
moreover an explicit calculation shows that the leading contribution
to the phase shift has exactly the same (a/l)4 coth  dependence as
for the coupling (39).
in the high energy limit we have therefore a

(58)

this is a rather unexpected prediction for a eld theory scattering
amplitude. before we discuss in more detail the range of validity of
the above expression we will rst analyze whether the counterterms
introduced by drukker, gross and ooguri [6], which are necessary for
the niteness of the wilson loop expectation values, can change the
above result.

6 the legendre transform prescription

in [6] the wilson loop prescription was modied by taking the legen-
dre transform:

a  a z dhhgijy ixy j

(59)

coordinates on s5 satisfying p6

where a is the nambu-goto action while y i = zi and the i are
i=1 ii = 1. the boundary contribu-
tion in (59) cancels exactly the 1/z divergence arising from integrating
(14). since the additional term does depend on the metric, it might,
in principle, change (56). it suces to calculate its behaviour under
variations of h  . we get

1

2h 

zx
z

z4
2z2

hgij y ixy jh  = z d

z dh
h   z d zh 
(60)
which vanishes when z  0 (note that the graviton greens functions
are nonsingular at the boundary  they vanish).
however one could envisage a modication of the bulk action which
would regularize the action upon imposing equations of motion. sup-
pose, for instance, that we modify the action to

max

h(1  c1) + x(h)c2

14

(61)

where the counterterms c1 and c2 do not depend explicitely on h 
(e.g. gabgijay iby j is such a term). this is equivalent to

h(1 + c1  xc2) + x(hc2)

(62)

for the second term to cancel the nambu-goto singularity arising from

h  z4, c2 should behave like z3 and hence by similar reasoning as

in (60) it would lead to a vanishing coupling to the graviton and so
would not give a contribution. any softer behaviour like z2 would, on
the other hand, introduce additional singularities which would have to
be cancelled by additional counterterms etc. therefore the cancelation
of the h  coupling should come just from the rst term in (62). but
now all the coupling to h  comes from h so the term in parentheses
should give 0 upon inserting equations of motion.

but clearly this is impossible, since this would lead to wrong results
for hwi. the above argument does not prove, of course, that some
more complicated counterterms would not help to cure this behaviour,
but it does not seem to be very likely.

7 range of validity of the weak eld
approximation

in this section we will analyze the range of validity of the results
obtained above. the general assumption in these calculations is that
the impact parameter l is much greater than the transverse size a of
the w -boson pair (which plays the role of a quark-antiquark pair). a
second constraint7 comes from the fact that we are staying within the
linearized gravitational regime. we will concentrate on the graviton
contribution which leads to the strongest constraint. the calculations
should be valid when the eld gtt produced by one of the moving
(tilted) worldsheets, evaluated at points on second worldsheet, should
be much smaller than the background ads metric gtt.

sheet is given by (compare (17) and (18))

the constraint is most restrictive when evaluating at w  a, which is
as far as the string worldsheet extends into the 5th dimension of the
ads5, so we get nally (dropping factors of order 1, and taking some
unit mass m  1):

a(cid:19)7

(67)

we see that when we x the impact parameter we cannot go to ar-
bitrarily high energies. at some point the gravitational eld becomes
so strong that one would have to consider multigraviton exchanges
and presumably perform resummation using the full picture of strings
propagating in ads space. the analysis of this regime is beyond the
scope of this paper. we note that this constraint is specic to the
analytic continuation from euclidean to minkowski geometry.

it is to be noticed that when (67) is satised the graviton phase

shift grav is indeed small as it should be

l(cid:19)6
grav  (cid:18) a

s  (cid:18) a

l(cid:19)67/2=2.5

(68)

other elds considered by us lead to less stringent constraints.

8 analysis of the high energy scatter-
ing amplitudes at large impact param-
eter

the leading l and s dependence of the phase shifts for the relevant
supergravity elds is kk = (a/l)2s1 for the tachyonic si scalar,
b = (a/l)4 for the b eld and grav = (a/l)6s for the graviton.

16

the proportionality constants, obtained explicitly for the scalars and
the graviton, are real.

the fact that we obtained real amplitudes is linked with the ex-
pectation that for large impact parameters the scattering should be
predominantly elastic.

standard crossing relations and analyticity properties of ampli-
tudes relate the phase of the amplitude with the energy behaviour and
signature of the exchanged state. for amplitudes behaving like 1/s
and s, a real amplitude implies positive signature  = +1, while for the
constant amplitude of the antisymmetric tensor we should have neg-
ative signature  = 1. this is indeed consistent with the behaviour
of the coupling of these elds to the string worldsheet under an ex-
change of the quark with the antiquark in one of the wilson loops.
this exchange translates into a change of orientation of the associated
string worldsheet. the coupling to the scalars and the graviton stays
invariant ( = +1) while the coupling to the b eld changes sign.
in this way we may also separate o the b contribution from the
others.

now we would like to analyze which supergravity elds are dom-
inant in dierent regions of the (a/l, s) parameter plane. we stay
within the weak eld approximation (67) where all the phase shifts
are small. we will consider two regimes.

fixed n  log l

a / log s

because of the form of the constraint (67) it will turn out to be con-
venient to parameterize

l
a

= sn

(69)

where n is a (real parameter), and look for dominant contributions
when increasing s, while keeping n xed. the constraint now is just
n > 2/7. the n dependence of the phase shifts for the tachyonic scalar,
antisymmetric tensor eld and the graviton is in this parameterization
kk  s12n, b  s4n and grav  s16n respectively. there
are 3 cases. for n between 2/7 and 1/2, the graviton contribution
dominates, followed by b and the kk si scalar, at n = 1/2 all
3 contributions are comparable, the precise values of the numerical
coecients (ignored in this analysis) would eventually dierentiate
between the 3 contributions which all behave here like (a/l)4, while
for n > 1/2 the kk si scalar dominates. notably enough, the above

17

shows that in a certain region of (large impact parameter) phase space
the bulk graviton exchange gives a dominant contribution to the sym
scattering amplitude.

fixed l

when we keep l/a xed and large and increase s (but staying below
the limit (l/a)7/2) we nd that the graviton contribution gives a linear
rise of the phase shift with s. indeed although s is not arbitrarily large
it dominates over the b contribution:

l(cid:19)6
grav  (cid:18) a

l(cid:19)2
s  (cid:18) a

s  b  (cid:18) l

a(cid:19)7/22=1.5

 b

(70)

so for suciently large l/a we see a linear rise of the phase shift with
s in gauge theory. this behaviour is rather unexpected in sym (see
the discussion). note however, that within the constraints, we are in
the region of applicability of the eikonal approximation as the graviton
phase shift (68) remains small.

9 discussion

at this point we may qualitatively contrast the situation with the
case of perturbative (non-supersymmetric) qcd. the leading large
log resummation give rise [5] to amplitudes rising like

4

 sn log 2

s

(71)

the exponent depends on the coupling constant, and increases with
s  this is a dynamical eect coming from enhanced gluon radiation
at small x.
in the strongly coupled phase (our calculation) we get
the exponent 1 which is purerly kinematical  it reects just the
spin-2 nature of the graviton. this may perhaps be thought of as a
nonperturbative strong coupling limit of some dynamically generated
enhancement, but if it were so there still remain some questions.

on the perturbative side one expects unitarity eects to set in at
large s thus leading to a constant s0 or at most logarithmic log s be-
haviour of the phase shift8. we may postulate that the same kind of

8however there may be subtleties in explicitly carrying over of the froissart bound to

the n = 4 sym, nonconning cft case.

18

unitarization on the supergravity side, might bring down the behaviour
from s1 to s0. however this would involve some very subtle behaviour
specic to ads. qualitatively such a strong suppression would call for
some cancelation of gravity in the high energy limit. the rr force
that cancels the static gravitational interaction between d-branes [26]
is negligible when one goes to the high relative velocity limit [27]. one
can check that indeed in the large impact parameter limit the dom-
inant contribution to the d-brane scattering phase shift comes also
from single graviton exchange leading to the phase shift proportional
to s. in the same regime the contribution of the excited string modes
would be supressed. we expect the same pattern of behaviour here.

for the case of 4-point virasoro-shapiro amplitude, which contains
the contribution of higher string modes, the large s, xed t regime gives
just a modication of the gravity tree level result due to reggeization:

s2
t 

s2

t  exp(cid:20) t

2

log(s)(cid:21)

(72)

this is a slightly wider regime than the one considered by us, as xing
even small t involves integration over all impact parameters. the
phase shift for small t is again proportional to s.

also analysis of perturbative resummation in gravity and string
theory in at space (see e.g. [28]) does not seem to soften the energy
behaviour.

for the case of ads5 one expects some dierences, in particular
one obtains a dierent t dependence without the 1/t pole (which is
regulated by the nite radius9 of ads). it would be extremely inter-
esting to investigate these issues in the ads context, however as we
saw, the tree level energy behaviour had exactly the same origin as in
at space.

the s behaviour obtained by us seems to be quite a robust and
generic feature of gravity mediated scattering in various contexts.
however the novel feature of the ads/cft correspondence allows
to translate this kind of behaviour to gauge theory scattering ampli-
tudes. this makes the full understanding of the high energy behaviour
for ads string theory into an interesting and subtle problem.

9in the large radius limit the dominant contribution to the greens functions should
come from the region of small u. all the above greens functions behave like u3/2, which
translates into 1/r3 behaviour characteristic of a free scalar propagator in at 5d space.
