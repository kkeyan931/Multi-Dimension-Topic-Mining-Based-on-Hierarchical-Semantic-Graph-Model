abstract

models of interactions of d-dimensional hypermultiplets and supersymmetric
gauge multiplets with n =8 supercharges (d6) can be formulated in the framework
of harmonic superspaces. the eective coulomb low-energy action for d=5 includes
the free and chern-simons terms. we consider also the non-abelian supereld d=5
chern-simons action. the biharmonic d=3,n =8 superspace is introduced for a
description of l and r supermultiplets and the mirror symmetry. the d=2, (4, 4)
gauge theory and hypermultiplet interactions are considered in the triharmonic su-
perspace. constraints for d=1,n =8 supermultiplets are solved with the help of
the su (2)spin(5) harmonics. eective gauge actions in the full d3,n =8 super-
spaces contain constrained (harmonic) superpotentials satisfying the (6d) laplace
equations for the gauge group u (1) or corresponding (6d)p-dimensional equations
for the gauge groups [u (1)]p. generalized harmonic representations of superpoten-
tials connect equivalent supereld structures of these theories in the full and analytic
superspaces. the harmonic approach simplies the proofs of non-renormalization
theorems.

introduction

the harmonic superspace (hs) has rstly been introduced for the o-shell description of
matter, gauge and supergravity supereld theories with the manifest d=4, n4=2 super-
symmetry [1, 2]. the su(2)/u(1) harmonics u
i and corresponding harmonic derivatives
++,  and 0 are used for the consistent solution of the supereld constraints in the
n4=2 superspace. the basic relations for the harmonics are

[++, ] = 0 ,

the hs approach has also been applied to consistently describe hypermultiplets and
vector multiplet in d=6, n6=1 supersymmetry [3, 4]. it is convenient to use the total
number of supercharges n for the classication of all these models in dierent dimensions
d instead of the number of spinor representations for supercharges nd. let us review
briey the basic aspects of the d=6,n =8 harmonic gauge theory. the harmonics u
i are

a , +) and the additional spinor
used to construct the analytic 6d coordinates =(bx
coordinate , where , ,  . . . are the 4-spinor indices of the (1, 0) representation of
the spin(5, 1) group and =u
i i. the harmonized spinor derivatives and harmonic
derivatives have the following form in these coordinates:

(1.6)

where b = /bx .

the grassmann analyticity condition in hs is d+

 =0. supereld constraints of
d=6 sy m in the ordinary superspace (central basis or cb) are equivalent to the inte-
grability conditions preserving this analyticity. the yang-mills prepotential v ++(, u) in
the analytic basis (ab) describes the 6d vector multiplet (a, 
i , x ik) and possesses
the gauge transformation with the analytic matrix parameter (, u)

v ++ = d++ + [v ++, ] = ++ .

(1.7)

the action of the d=6 sy m theory has the form of integral over the full superspace

vanishes due to the analyticity of the parameter and prepotential. we have used here the
harmonic zero-curvature equation

d++v   dv ++ + [v ++, v ] = 0 ,

(1.10)

where v  is the connection for the harmonic derivative d. note that reality conditions
for the harmonic connections include the special conjugation of harmonics preserving the
u(1)-charges [1]

(1.11)
the physical elds of the hypermultiplet f i and  and the innite number of auxil-
iary elds are components of the analytic 6d supereld q+(, u). the interaction of the
hypermultiplet and gauge eld can be written in the analytic superspace

(v ) = v  .

i = ui ,

fu

s(q+, v ++) =z d (4)duq+(d++ + v ++)q+ ,

(1.12)

where d (4)=d6xa(d)4 is the analytic measure in hs.

universality of harmonic superspaces is connected with the possibility of constructing
n =8 models in d<6 by a dimensional reduction. the hs analysis of the d=4 low-energy
eective actions has been considered for the gauge superelds [7] and for the hypermul-
tiplets [8]. the manifestly supersymmetric calculations in hs are in a good agreement
with the basic ideas of the seiberg-witten theory [6], however, the hs geometry allows
us to rewrite the chiral-superspace coulomb action as the integral in the full superspace

iz d4xd4f (w ) + c.c. =z d4xd8duv ++v [f (w ) + c.c.] ,

(1.13)

where f (w )=iw 2f (w ) is the holomorphic part of the superpotential in this represen-
tation. it should be stressed that the lagrange density in the full superspace is not gauge-
invariant in contrast to the chiral density. the superpotential f (w, w )=[f (w ) + c.c.] is
the most general solution of the constraints

d+


 f (w, w ) = 0  w
d+

w f (w, w ) = 0 ,

(1.14)

which follow from the gauge invariance. representations of the action in the full, analytic
and chiral superspaces are important for the hs interpretation of the electric-magnetic
duality [9].

the holomorphic action can be reduced to lower dimensions, however, this reduction
does not produce the general eective action. the n =8 supersymmetries have some
specic features for each dimension based on dierences in the structure of lorentz groups
ld, maximum automorphism groups rd and the set of central charges zd. the main
result of this work is a construction of the coulomb eective actions for the dimensions
d=1, 2, 3 and 5 in the full n =8 superspace

sd =z ddx d8 du v ++v fd(w ) ,

(1.15)

where fd(w ) is the superpotential and w is the constrained (6d)-component supereld
strength for the u(1) gauge prepotential v ++. the gauge invariance of this action implies
the (6d)-dimensional laplace equation for the general superpotential

w

dfd(w ) = 0 ,

2

(1.16)

which generalizes the 2d-laplace equation (1.13). the (6d)-harmonic solutions of this
equation can be used for a description of non-perturbative solutions in the n =8 gauge
theories. we discuss harmonic-integral representations of the d3 superpotentials which
allow us to construct the equivalent analytic-superspace representations of sd.
it should be remarked that the function fd determines -model structures and inter-

actions of the (6d)-dimensional scalar eld with fermion and vector elds.
tions of eq.(1.16)

renormalization theorems in this approach are connected with the rd-invariant solu-

d (wd) = g2
f r

d + kdwd4

d

,

d 6= 4 ,

(1.17)
where the invariant supereld wd can be interpreted as a length in the (6d)-moduli
space, and gd and kd are coupling constants.
the eective actions of the [u(1)]p gauge theories are considered also by these methods.
the matrix superpotentials of these theories satisfy the (6d)p-dimensional laplace-
type equations. it is interesting that rich harmonic structures of moduli spaces for the
d3,n =8 theories arising in connection with the equations for superpotentials generalize
naturally the original su(2)-harmonic structure of the d4,n =8 theories.
sect.2 is devoted to the 5-dimensional hs theories. the eective action of the d=5
abelian theory contains the free term and the cubic chern-simons term. we also construct
the non-abelian supereld chern-simons term.

in sect.3, we consider the biharmonic superspace (bhs) using harmonics of the au-
tomorphism group sul(2)sur(2) in the d=3,n =8 models. the l-analytic gauge pre-
potentials and hypermultiplets have their mirror partners in the r-analytic superspace.
the d=2, (4, 4) models in the triharmonic suc(2)sul(2)sur(2) superspace (t hs)
[29, 30, 31] are discussed in sect.4. we underline the importance of the (4,4) gauge theory
and derive the formula for the eective action in the full superspace, which is equivalent
to the action in the rl-analytic superspace.

an adequate supereld description of the d=1,n =8 theories requires the use of har-
monics for the automorphism group r1 = suc(2)spin(5). we dene the corresponding
bhs gauge and hypermultiplet models in sect.5.
problems of the n =8 gauge theories have earlier been discussed in the framework
of the component-eld formalism or the formalism with n =4, d=1, 2, 3 superelds (see
e.g.[11, 13, 34, 39]). in particular, the (6d) laplace equations have been considered
in the n =4 supereld formalism of the n =8 gauge theories and in the formalism of the
corresponding -models. nevertheless, it should be stressed that the manifestly covariant
hs approach provides the most adequate and universal methods to solve the problems
of the n =8 theories in all dimensions. a short discussion of these ideas has also been
presented in [10].

five-dimensional harmonic gauge theories

let us consider rstly the harmonic superspace with the d=5, n =8 supersymmetry.
the general ve-dimensional superspace has the coordinates z=(xm, 
i ), where m and
 are the 5-vector and 4-spinor indices of the lorentz group l5=so(4, 1), respectively,
and i is the 2-spinor index of the automorphism group r5=su(2). the spinors of l5 are
equivalent to the pair of the sl(2, c) spinors: =(,  ).

the real supereld strength of this theory can be written in terms of the harmonic

d(+2)
 w = 0 .

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

the abelian supereld w does not depend on harmonics.

the 5d sy m action has the universal form (1.8) in the full harmonic superspace.
the sy m equations have the vacuum abelian solution v++=i(+2)z where z is the
linear combination of the cartan generators of the gauge group ( see the analogous d=4
solution in ref.[8]). this vacuum solution spontaneously breaks the gauge symmetry, but
it conserves the d=5 supersymmetry with the central charge and produces bp s masses
of the z-charged elds.

chiral superspaces are not lorentz-covariant in the case d=5, so one can use the
full and analytic superspaces only. it is readily to construct the most general low-energy
eective u(1)-gauge action in the full n =8 harmonic superspace

3 three-dimensional biharmonic superspace

three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories have been intensively studied in the
framework of new nonperturbative methods [13, 14, 15]. supereld description of the
simplest d=3, n =2, 4 theories and various applications have earlier been discussed
in refs.
[16, 17, 18, 19]. three-dimensional harmonic superspaces were considered in
refs.[20, 21]. the most interesting features of the d=3 theories are connected with the
chern-simons terms for gauge elds and also with the mirror symmetry between vector
multiplets and hypermultiplets.

the d=3, n =8 gauge theory can be constructed in the superspace with the automor-
phism group r3=sul(2)sur(2). coordinates of the corresponding general superspace
are z=(x, 
ia). we use here the two-component indices ,  . . . for the space-time
group sl(2, r), i, k . . . for the group sul(2) and a, b . . . for sur(2), respectively.

the relations between basic spinor derivatives are

(3.1)
where =/x and z ab are the central charges which commute with all generators
exept for the generators of sur(2). these central charges can be interpreted as covariantly
constant abelian gauge superelds by analogy with [8].

as follows:

the supereld constraints of the n =8 sy m theory in the central basis can be written

where m are covariant derivatives with supereld connections and w ab is the constrained
supereld of the sy m theory (l-vector supermultiplet)

r-harmonics v(0,1)

the case d=4 [8].

the l-analytic hypermultiplet q+  q(1,0) has the standard minimal interaction with
v ++
l  v (2,0) (see (1.12)). by analogy with refs.[3, 8], one can construct the free hs

 f3(w ab) = 0 ,

where the analyticity of v ++

the general superpotential breaks the sur(2) invariance. the r3-invariant superpo-

where g3 is the coupling constant of dimension d=  1/2, and k3 is the dimensionless
constant of the n =8 w znw -type interaction of the vector multiplet. this superpoten-
tial is singular at the point zab=0 of the moduli space. the eld model is well dened
in the shifted variables wab=wab  zab for nonvanishing central charges.
it should be
remarked that the supereld interactions of the 3d-vector multiplets with dimensionless
constants (chern-simons terms) have earlier been constructed for the case n =4 [18] and
n =6 [20, 21].

be generalized to the case of non-abelian sy m theory.

4 two-dimensional (4,4) harmonic superspaces

the two-dimensional (4,4) and (4,0) -models have been discussed in the eld-component
formalism and in the framework of the ordinary or harmonic superspaces [23]-[32]. the
(4,4) gauge theory has been considered in the component formalism and in the (2,2)
superspace [33, 34, 35]. we shall study the geometry of this theory in the manifestly
covariant harmonic formalism which is convenient for the supereld quantum calculations.
the maximum automorphism group of the (4,4) superspace is sol(4)sor(4); how-
ever, we shall mainly use the group r2=suc(2)sul(2)sur(2). let us choose the left
and right coordinates in the (4,4) superspace

zl = (y, i) ,

zr = (y, ia) ,

(4.1)

where y = (1/2)(t + x) and y = (1/2)(t  x) are the light-cone 2d coordinates; and

the following types of 2-spinor indices are used: i, k, . . . for suc(2); ,  . . . for sul(2)
and a, b . . . for sur(2), respectively. the so(1, 1) weights of coordinates are (1, 1/2) for
zl and (1,  1/2) for zr. the algebra of spinor derivatives in this superspace

{dk, dl} = kly ,
{ dka, dlb} = klab y ,
{dk, dlb} = iklzb

(4.2)
(4.3)
(4.4)

contains the central charges zb.

the cb-geometry of the (4,4) sy m theory is described by the supereld constraints

{k,l} = kly ,
{ ka, lb} = klab y ,
{k, lb} = iklwb ,

(4.5)
(4.6)
(4.7)

where m=dm + am is the covariant derivative for the corresponding coordinate. the
gauge-covariant supereld wb satises the constraints of the (4,4) vector multiplet which
are equivalent to the constraints of the so-called twisted multiplet [23, 27].

the authors of refs.[29, 30, 31] have discussed three types of harmonics: u

i =u(1,0,0)
for sur(2)/ur(1). we use the

i

for suc(2)/uc(1) ; l(0,1,0)



for sul(2)/ul(1); and r(0,0,1)

the (2,2) formalism is gauge-invariant by denition, and the 4d laplace equation arises
in this approach from the restrictions of the (4,4) supersymmetry; while in our (4,4)
formulation the analogous condition on the (4,4) superpotential (4.18) follows from the
gauge invariance. the manifestly (4,4) covariant formalism of the harmonic gauge theory
simplies the proof of the non-renormalization theorem.

consider the t hs decomposition of the grassmann measure

d8 = d(0,2,2)d(0,2,2) ,
d(0,2,2) = d(1,1,0)d(1,1,0) d(1,0,1) d(1,0,1) .

(4.37)
(4.38)

using this decomposition and eqs.(4.17,4.21) one can obtain the following equivalent
representation of the eective (4,4) action in the rl-analytic superspace:

s2 =z dldrd2xd(0,2,2)[w (0,1,1)]2f2[w (0,1,1), l, r] .

(4.39)

one can construct the eective (4,4) action for the gauge group [u(1)]p in the rl-

analytic and full superspaces by analogy with the case d=3 (3.36,3.37).

an analogous action of the q(1,1) multiplet and dual superelds (1,1) has been con-
sidered in refs.[29, 30, 31]. the relation between the c-analytic gauge supereld and
rl-analytic hypermultiplets is a specic manifestation of the 2d mirror symmetry [33].

the triharmonic superspace is convenient for the classication of the (4,4) supermulti-
(c, r, u, r) satisfying

plets. let us consider, for instance, the cr-analytic supereld q(1,0,1)

the bhs representation of the general 1d superpotential (5.14) is

f1(w) =z dvf1[w (0,1,1), v] ,

(5.28)
(5.29)

(5.30)

where the real function f1 determines the general solution of the 5d laplace equation.
partial solutions can contain, for instance, functions of two variables w13 and w14.

using this relation and eq.(5.23) we can obtain the v-analytic representation of the

1d eective action (5.13)

s1 =z dvdtvd(0,2,2)[w (0,1,1)(v)]2f1[w (0,1,1)(v), v] ,

(5.31)

where the following grassmann measure is used:

d(0,2,2) = d(1,1,0)d(1,1,0)d(1,0,1)d(1,0,1) .

(5.32)

the eective action for an arbitrary gauge group can be constructed in the v-analytic
superspace. the matrix superpotential for the gauge group [u(1)]p in the full superspace
satises the following conditions:

it is not dicult to dene the triplet of v-analytic superelds which is dual to the

supereld w (0,1,1)

these superelds have an innite number of auxiliary components.

the interpolating term for the duality relation has the following form:
