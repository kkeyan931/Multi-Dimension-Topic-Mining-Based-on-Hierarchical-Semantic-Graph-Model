abstract

generalising a result of classical mechanics an innite set of conserved quan-
tities can be found for the bare equations of motion describing the evolution
of a scalar eld in out of equilibrium quantum eld theory, in the large n
approximation, with initial conditions corresponding to a thermal system of
the free hamiltonian. using these new conserved quantities, sum-rules relat-
ing integrals over the mode-functions (momenta) can be derived. more, the
corresponding renormalised quantities can also be computed out thus giving
information about the evolution of the already known renormalised equations;
nally it is also possible to write a renormalised version of the sum-rules.

introduction

nowadays, out of equilibrium quantum eld theory is believed to act as a powerful tool
in order to understand systems within which the energy or particle density are high. this
is typically the case for cosmological problems [13] such as ination [48], for which the
study of preheating [9,10] is now well understood with a self consistent treatment in out
of equilibrium qft. it is now understood how the particle production behaves [11,12], in
particular what is the contribution of the quantum uctuation in this process. the physics
of heavy ion can also be studied [13] with this theory in particular the hadronisation process
of the quark gluon plasma. the analysis of initial condition is also well understood [14,15].
during the last couple of years many impressive results have been found using accurate
numerical computations with dierent approximations in the form of the equation of motion:
one loop [16], hartree, leading order in large n expansion and even recently beyond the
leading order. the variety was not only in the methods but also in the models and the
physical problems that were studied: systems with fermions [17], electrodynamics [18,19],
non-abelian gauge elds [9],...

although the scope of the theory is becoming wider and wider there only few analytical
results compared to the numerical works. the new analytical result are mainly well con-
trolled expansion [2], that have been occasionally re-summed [18,20] . notwithstanding all
those attempts exact results have seldom been found [21], only two sum-rules were found
[22] in the case of a scalar eld with initial conditions corresponding to a zero temperature
bath, one has to mention that a generalisation for non zero temperature has been predicted
using one loop computation [23].

the aim of the present paper is to prove the existence of a hierarchy of sum-rules that
generalise the previous result. using such sum-rules one should be able to nd more on
the system, since just using the rst to sum-rules one was able to nd out the asymptotical
equation of state of the quantum system.

in order to get a progressive understanding the classical results will be summarised in
the following section. using those result it will be possible to construct in section ii the
bare conserved quantities for a scalar eld in out of equilibrium eld theory. bare sum-rules
expressed in terms of momenta, i.e.
integrals over the modes and their derivates, will be
explicited in section iii. the analysis of the renormalisation process will be described in
section iv for the conserved quantities; in section v it will be shown how the momenta and
the sum-rules can be renormalised in a such way that the sum-rules still hold for renormalised
quantities.

i. classical oscillator in radial quartic potential

we just recall some results on the radial quartic potential, that have been studied by
by choodnovsky and choodnovsky [24,25] and extended by wojciechowski [26]. we shall
give a brief review of the results of grosse [27], we consider a n-dimensional system whose
evolution is given from the following hamiltonian:

h =

1
2

(p2

i + rkq2

i ) +

n

xi=1

1

4  n
xi=1

q2

i!2

,

(1.1)

2

where all the masses are dierent.

one can say that the o(n) invariance is broken by dierent masses. nonetheless the sys-
tem remains integrable, since one can nd a complete set of (independent) and commutating
conserved quantities which can be written as:

ki = xi6=j

(qipj  qjpi)2

rj  ri

+ 2p2

i + 2riq2

i + q2

i

it is straight forward to check the following:

q2
j

n

xj=1

(1.2)

(1.3)

nki, kjo= 0

one should notice that, the hamiltonian can easily be reconstructed from the ki, one

trivially has:

h =

1
4

n

xi=1

ki

(1.4)

ii. bare conserved quantities in out of equilibrium qft

the main idea is to generalise the previous result to the innite number of equation
describing the motion of a scalar eld in out of equilibrium quantum eld theory. in the
leading order in the large n expansion the equations of motion read (for a detailed derivation
one should refer to [23,28,29,3])

  d2
dt2 + m(t)2!(t) = 0
  d2
dt2 + k2 + m(t)2!k(t) = 0 ,

where the eective mass m is dened through the bare uctuations b as:


2

m(t)2 = m2 +
42 z 
b(t) =

1

0

(t)2 +


2

(t)

coth  wk

2 !|k(t)|2k2 dk

wk = qk2 + m(0)2 ,

where  denotes the cut-o.
the initial conditions read

k(0) =

1
wk
k(0) = iqwk

3

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

one should notice that since these conditions are smooth functions of k, the mode functions
k(t) will also have the same property at all time t. the latter denitions old whenever the
initial system corresponds to a thermal state of the free hamiltonian, with a temperature of
1. the zero temperature limit can be obtain letting  go to +. hitherto, it is always
possible to write the equation of motion as:

  d2
dt2 + m(t)2!(t) = 0
  d2
dt2 + k2 + m(t)2!k(t) = 0,

where the eective mass is written as

m(t)2 = m2 + (t)2 + s0(t)
s0(t) = z 

|k(t)|2 dk

0

to get such an expression it is enough to introduce to the following notations:

 = s 
k = kks 

2

82 coth

it is also convenient to introduce:

s = 2

 + s0 = 2

 +z 

0

|k(t)|2 dk

rk = m2 + k2
r = m2

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

sum p q2

i

this quantity s appears as a general quadratic sum, this will play the same role than the
in the classical analysis. nevertheless one should notice that now the quantities

are complex and that the condensate  plays a particular role.
with these notations, the natural quantities that generalise those dened by equation (1.2)
are:

0

kk = z 
k = z 

0

|k k  kk|2
| k  k|2

k2  k2

k2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

dk + 2(cid:16) 2

2

k  k(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(cid:17) + 2

s

 + m22

+ 2(cid:16)| 2

k| + (m2 + k2)|2

k|(cid:17) + |k|2s

(2.8)

in order to manipulate these quantities we have to know whether there are well dened. let
rst study k, the only tricky term is the 1/k2 in the integral, but this in fact a false pole
since k contains k factor. since k is regular k is well dened.
the same can be said for the 1/k2 term of kk. so for kk the term that might be ill dened
is the rst integral which contains 1/(k2  k2), but since k(t) is a smooth function of k

4

and t, then then ratio as nite value when k approaches k, hence the integral is well dened
and so is kk.
now we shall prove that these quantities kk and k do not depend on time. this can be
directly done using the equation of motion for  and the k. the main ingredient of the
prove is the use of the following property:

s =   +z 

0 (cid:16) k

k + k 
k(cid:17)

lets study k simple algebraic computation using the equation of motion leads to:

(2.9)

the nal step is to express the conserved quantities in term of the physical modes, that is 
and k; we get the following bare conserved quantities, the rst is given from k and reads

c0,b =

2 +

1
2

m2
b

2 +

b
8

4 +

b

322 z 

0

coth

wk

2 "| k  k|2 + k2|k|22# dk , (2.12)

and the other are a set c(k)b given from the kk:

c(k)b =

b + k2)|k|2! +

k2

2  | k|2 + (m2

+ |k|2|k|2# dk .

wk

2 "|k k  kk|2

k2  k2

(2.13)

one should notice, that in the last set of conserved quantities c(k = 0)b is indeed trivial,
since it is expressed in term of a wronskian (  and 0 are solution of the same second order
dierential equation),

c(0)b = 

b
2 | 0  0|2 .

(2.14)

iii. hierarchy of bare sum-rules

although we have already found an innite number of relations that can be considered
as sum-rules, it is possible to go further and prove the existence of relations between several
integrals over the modes.
the rst sum-rule will be given from

e0,b = c0,b +

42 z 

0

c(k)b coth

whereas the other will be derivated from

en,b =

22 z 

0

k2nc(k)b coth

wk

2

dk ,

n  1 .

(3.1)

(3.2)

all the quantities en,b are trivially conserved and a constant may be added without changing
this property.
one can easily show that:

e0,b =

2 +

1
2

m2
b
2

2 +

k(t) = qk2 + m(t)2 .

k2 coth

wk

2 (cid:16)| k|2 + 2

k|k|2(cid:17) dk ,

(3.3)

this shows that e0,b is nothing but the bare energy. this property was expected since it is
a generalisation of equation (1.4).
the hierarchy of sum-rule will be given from the newly constructed conserved quantities

en,b for n greater than 1, hereafter we shall use the following notation to express some
integrals over the modes, that are indeed momenta:

n,b =

one should notice that 1,b is nothing butb.
using these notations it is straightforward to get

en,b = n+1,b + m2

bn+1,b + n+2,b

+

b

4  2n+1,b  2n,b  2n,b + 2 n,b + in,b + bn+1,b! ,

where in,b reads:

in,b =

0

|k k  kk|2 k2k2k2n

k2  k2 coth

(3.6)

it is possible to express in,b as a sum of integrals p,b, p,b and p,b, to achieve this one
should use the trivial relation:

xn = (x  y)qn(x, y) + yn

n1

qn(x, y) =

xpyn1p

xp=0

(3.7)

hence,

in,b = z

42

|k k  kk|2"qn(k2, k2) +

k2n

k2  k2# coth

. (3.8)

swapping k and k leads to:

in,b =

1

2(42)2 z 

0

|k k  kk|2qn(k2, k2)k2k2 coth

wk

2

coth

wk

2

(3.9)

using the following wronskian relation

k 

k  

kk = 2i ,

(3.10)

one gets:

|k k  kk| = | k|2|k|2 + | k|2|k|2 +

1
2

( k

k + k 

k)( k

k + k 

k) + 2 (3.11)

the last 2 will just give an additive constant term to en,b that can be dropped out, using
the latter relation, one can write in,b as

7

in,b =

n

xp=1 p,bn+1p,b  p,bn+1p,b!

(3.12)

one nally get an innite number of relations between the p,b, p,b and p,b:

en,b = n+1,b + m2

bn+1,b + n+2,b

+

b

4 "2(n+1,b  n,b)  2n,b + 2 n,b

+bn+1,b +

n

xp=1(cid:16)p,bn+1p,b  p,bn+1p,b(cid:17)#

, n  1 .

(3.13)

these equations can indeed be seen as a hierarchy of relations between integrals over the
modes.

iv. renormalised conserved quantities

it is has already been proven [3,10,23] that the equation of motion for a quantum scalar
eld can be written in term of renormalised quantities. let recall here the main results that
are given with more details in previous studies. there are several important points. first
that since the short distance behaviour is not related to the out of equilibrium state of the
system, the coupling constant is renormalised as in usual quantum eld theory, that is:

b =

r
1  r
162 log 

r 1 +
b
162 log

m2

b +

b
162 2 = m2



!

(4.1)

where  is the renormalisation scale and b and r subscripts denotes the bare and renor-
malised quantities.
the second point is that all the modes are not modied since the eective mass m is not
changed:

m2

b +

b
2

(t)2 +

mb(t) = mr(t)
b
b(t) = m2
r +
2

r
2

(t)2 +

r
2

r(t)

using these notations, the renormalised equations remains formally the same

  d2
dt2 + m(t)2!(t) = 0
  d2
dt2 + k2 + m(t)2!k(t) = 0
m(t)2 = m2

(t)2 +

r
2

r +

r
2

r(t) ,

just the uctuations  are renormalised as:

(k  )

wk = qk2 + m(0)2

with the unchanged initial conditions:

(4.4)

(4.5)

k(0) =

1
wk
k(0) = iqwk

the last point concerns the behaviour of |k|2 and | k|2 for large momenta k, that can be
found using a wkb expansion, in term of the eective potential v(t), these read:

(4.6)

now in order to construct renormalised conserved quantities, we start with the previously
found quantities, which are expressed in terms of the bare coupling constants and uctua-
tions.
a direct computation leads to:

(4.7)

the integral has been splited into four parts each of which having, as it will be shown, a
nite limit when  goes to innity. the explicit temperature dependence has been put into
the rst integral. the latter is convergent since the mode functions have, in the worse case,
a polynomial behaviour which is washed out by the exponential factor.
only the last three integrals have to studied with care. this is done using equations (4.6),
which give the asymptotic behaviour of the modes for large k:

| k|2 + k2|k|2  2k =

k

v2
4k3 + o(

(4.8)

this proves the convergence of the two rst integrals, the last one is analysed computing:

|k 

k| = |k|2| k|2
v
= (cid:16)1 +
2k2 +
1
= 1 + o(
k6 )
k)2 + (im k 
= (re k 
k)2
the wronskian relation (3.10) can be rewritten as

3v2  v
8k4 (cid:17)(cid:16)1 

this leads directly to

(im k 

k) = 1 .

(re k 

k) = k 

k + k

k = o(

which proves the convergence of the last integral.
hence the renormalised conserved quantity c0,r reads

now it is possible to do about the same work with cn,b, a similar computation leads to:

(cid:16)1

(cid:17)c(k)b =

(4.13)

however, as it shall be shown it is not yet possible to let  go to innity in this last
expression.
there are three integrals that may diverge:

10

k2

k! dk

z   k2
z   k2
z 

k2  k2| k|2 + k2|k|2  2k 
k2  k2|k|2 
k2  k2 
k 

k kk + k k 

k! dk

k2

1

k! dk
k

(4.14)

since we are interested in the behaviour for large k the lower bound of the integral has
been omitted, and is indeed assumed to be greater the k and , that is avoiding the possible
divergences for k going to k that are known not to exist.
the expansions already used previously proves that the integrants of the to rst integrals
are such that

k2

k2  k2| k|2 + k2|k|2  2k 
k2  k2|k|2 

k2

k2
k = o(
1
k = o(

1
k3 )
1
k3 ) .

(4.15)

this means that the two rst integrals have a nite value for large .
for that last integral we shall again use the wronskian relation (3.10) as in equation (3.11):



k 

k kk + k k 

k

k = 2 +

so the last equation can be rewritten as:

( k

k + k

(4.17)

where just the last integral will give rise to a divergence, but this integral is indeed a constant
so can be dropped without adding a time dependent quantity.
after letting  go to innity the renormalised c(k)r read:

c(k)r =

v. renormalised sum-rules and momenta

the aim of the present section is to generalises the sum-rules

11

en,b = n+1,b + m2

bn+1,b + n+2,b

+

b

4 "2(n+1,b  n,b)  2n,b + 2 n,b

n

xp=1(cid:16)p,bn+1p,b  p,bn+1p,b(cid:17)#

, n  1 ,

(5.1)

with renormalised version of the momenta.
the pivotal relations that shall be used are the transcription of the equation of motion in
term of the momenta, those read as:

n + 2m2n + 2n+1 = 0
n = 2n
n + n+1 + m2n = n

(5.2)

this set of equations are true for bare quantities and we generalise them for regularised and
renormalised momenta.
in order, to simplify the discussion the following notation is introduce: the sum-rules are
written as:

en = n+1 + n+2 + m2n+1 + fn,

n  1

(5.3)

where fn is a functional depending only on k, k and k for k at most equal to n; a similar
relation is also true for the energy (e0):

2e0 = 1 + 2 + m21 + f0,

(5.4)

where f0 depend on 1,  and .
the prove is inductive, we shall construct all the renormalised momenta order per order
and thus generalising the sum-rules. using the standard expansion (4.6), one is able to
renormalise the rst momenta:

0,r =

0,r =

1

42 z

(k  )!dk .

(5.5)

we straightforwardly construct 0,r and 1,r using the equation of motion for the momenta:

1
2

0,r ,

0,r =
1,r = 0,r  (0.r + m20,r) ,

one nds that

0,r =

(5.6)

(5.7)

one should notice that this last expression is the usual form for the uctuations. whenever
one wants to make a nite change in the renormalisation of the uctuation , one should
also make a change in the momenta 0,r and for the renormalised mass m2
r; for instance a
common change is:

r
2

1,r(0) ,

r +

m2
r  m2
1,r  1,r  1,r(0) ,
0,r  0,r  1,r(0) .

(5.8)

the key point is that this transformation do not modify the equations of motion (5.2).
using, similar technics one easily nds that:

1,r =

1,r =

1

k k

k(cid:19) coth

v

(k  )!dk .

(5.9)

in order to nd 1,r and 2,r one should use the following relations together

2e0 = 1 + 2 + m21 + f0,
1 + 2 + m21 = 1 .

since the energy is a constant it can be renormalised, with a simple subtraction:

e0,r = e0,r(t0) + e0,b  e0,b(t0)

(5.10)

(5.11)

moreover f0 can be renormalised since it is expressed in term of renormalisable quantities.
so we juste have to solve a set of two linear equations in 1,r and 2,r.
now one can generalised this to all the momenta by induction. let suppose that one already
has renormalised all the momenta up to n+1, n and n. on easily get:

n+1,r =

n+1,r

1
2

(5.12)

to nd n+1 and n+2, one uses the fact that en is a constant so can be renormalised, so
one have to solve a set of to linear equations for renormalised quantities.

en = n+1 + n+1 + m2n+2 + fn ,
n+1 + n+2 + m2n+1 = n+1 ,
where fn is a function of already renormalised quantities.
using this method one is able to both get a renormalisation procedure for the momenta and
conserve the form of the sum-rule, that can be written in terms of renormalised quantities:

(5.13)

en,r = n+1,r + m2

rn+1,r + n+2,r

outline

the main result of the paper was to prove the existence of a hierarchy of sum-rules which
were given in term of the mode functions of a scalar eld in out of equilibrium quantum
eld theory.
