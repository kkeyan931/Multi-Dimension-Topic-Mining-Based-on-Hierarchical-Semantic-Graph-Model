we construct intersecting brane congurations in anti-de-sitter space localizing gravity to the
intersection region, with any number n of extra dimensions. this allows us to construct two kinds
of theories with innitely large new dimensions, tev scale quantum gravity and sub-millimeter
deviations from newtons law. the eective 4d planck scale mp l is determined in terms of the
fundamental planck scale m and the ads radius of curvature l via the familiar relation m 2
p l 
m 2+n
 ln; l acts as an eective radius of compactication for gravity on the intersection. taking
m  tev and l  sub-mm reproduces the phenomenology of theories with large extra dimensions.
alternately, taking m  l1  mp l, and placing our 3-brane a distance  100m 1
p l away from the
intersection gives us a theory with an exponential determination of the weak/planck hierarchy.

unication of gravity with other forces of nature sug-
gests that the world has more than three spatial dimen-
sions. since only three of these are presently observable,
one has to explain why the additional ones have eluded
detection. the conventional explanation is that the di-
mensions are compactied with tiny radii of order the
planck length  1033 cm, which makes them impossi-
ble to probe with currently available energies.
it has recently been pointed out that new dimensions
may have a size r much larger than the fundamental
planck length of the theory, perhaps as large as a mil-
limeter [1,2]. this has the eect of diluting the strength
of the 4d gravity observed at distances much larger than
r. the 4d planck scale mp l is determined by the funda-
rn
mental planck scale m
where n is the number of new dimensions. the original
motivation was to bring the fundamental gravitational
scale close to the weak scale in order to solve the hierar-
chy problem. these large dimensions are not in conict
with experiment if the standard model elds are conned
to a 3-brane in the extra dimensions.

in this scenario, the only reason to compactify the ex-
tra dimensions at all is to reproduce 4d newtonian grav-
ity at long distances. one can wonder if even this is
necessary: if gravity itself is somehow trapped to our
3-brane, then 4d gravity can be reproduced even if the
extra dimensions are innitely large. a very interesting
recent construction by randall and sundrum [3] and by
gogberashvili [4] provides an explicit realization of this
idea for the case of one extra dimension. solving ein-
steins equations with a 3-brane in (4 + 1) dimensions,
together with a bulk cosmological constant, they nd a
massless 4d graviton localized to the 3-brane. the re-
sulting gravitational potential between any two objects
on the brane is inversely proportional to the distance

1

between the objects, and not its square, despite the pres-
ence of the innite fth dimension.

it is clearly desirable to extend this idea to any number
of new dimensions. at rst sight, however, the mecha-
nism of [3,4] seems to rely on the peculiar properties of
co-dimension one objects in gravity and seems hard to
extend to the case of more dimensions. however, all that
seems to be required is the presence of some co-dimension
one branes in the system, while our 3-brane can have
larger co-dimension. we are led to consider a system of
n mutually intersecting (2 + n) branes in (3 + n) + 1 di-
mensions with a bulk cosmological constant. the branes
intersect on 3 spatial dimensions, where the standard
model elds reside. intuitively, each of the (2 +n) branes
has co-dimension one and tries to localize gravity to it-
self. therefore gravity will be localized to the intersection
of all the branes! we will now conrm this intuition by
explicit calculations.

we begin by deriving the solution describing the in-
tersection of branes. consider an array of n orthogonal
n+2-spatial dimensional branes in (3+n)+1 dimensions,
with a bulk cosmological constant . for simplicity we
take the branes to have identical tension . the eld
equations can be derived from the action

it is now straightforward to write down the solutions.
away from the branes, the solution in the bulk comprises
of patches of the 4 + n-dimensional anti-de-sitter space.
hence if the branes are mutually orthogonal, by symme-
try the full solution simply consists of 2n identical patches
of the adsn+4 which ll up the higher-dimensional quad-
rants between the branes, and are glued together along
the branes. to construct it, we start with the poincare
half-plane parametrization of adsn+4, given by

ds2

n+4 =

z2 (cid:16) dxdx + d ~w2

n1 + dz2(cid:17).

(3)

the length scale l is determined by the bulk cosmological
constant as

to make use of the symmetry, it is convenient to nd the
patch of (3) where the metric is manifestly symmetric
under permutations of all extra dimensions. this is most
easily accomplished by an o(n) rotation of ~wn1, z. we
transform to new coordinates zk, k  {1, ..., n} by a rigid
j=1 zj/n. in terms of
rotation chosen such that z = pn
these coordinates, the metric is

(dzk)2(cid:17).

(5)

the metric (5) covers a segment of the extra dimensions
bounded by the branes. led by our discussion above, we
will take such a cell of adsn+4 with e.g. all the zj > l for
some l. we then ll out the rest of the space by reecting
this cell in all 2n distinct ways about its boundaries. the

resulting metric is given by replacing pj zj by pj |zj|+l

in eqn.(5). by rescaling x, z, we can set l to any value we
wish, and we use this freedom to put the metric in the
nal form 

where k  (nl)1. this choice corresponds to setting

the conformal factor in (6) to unity at the intersection
zk = 0. physically this means that the unit of length on
the intersection is set by m 1
. in this metric, each zj is
allowed to vary on the whole real line. the curvature of
the space will now have singularities at the seams where
we have pasted together the elementary cells, but these
will be precisely those dictated by the presence of the
branes.



it is straightforward to see this explicitly. the metric
is a conformal transformation of at space gab = 2ab
where

kpj |zj| + 1

is the warp factor. we can trivially compute the ein-
stein tensor gab = rab  1/2gabr using the standard
relation (in general for gab = 2gab for d spacetime di-
mensions)

( log)2(cid:19) .

using this it is easy to compute the einstein tensor for
our metric, and we nd

which reproduces eqn.(2) if the brane tension  is chosen
to be  = 2(n + 2)k.

in order to demonstrate that we have indeed local-
ized gravity to the intersection, we must look at the
linear perturbations about this solution.
it is conve-
nient to parameterize the perturbations by replacing
 with  + h(x, z) in eqn.(6). again using the
conformal transformation eqn.(8) we easily nd the lin-
earized eld equations for h, which are in the gauge

the
transverse-traceless gauge is invariant under conformal
transformations on the background (6), and hence our
calculation in the conformal frame exactly reproduces the
results in the original frame (6). this immediately shows
that the ordinary four-dimensional graviton is present as
a massless mode in the theory, corresponding to a z in-
dependent solution h(x, z) = h(x). indeed, replacing 
by g(4)
 (x) in eqn.(6) and inserting into the action, we
nd

the exact calculation gives m 2

relation suggests that l can be interpreted as the eec-
tive size of n compact dimensions, even though the extra
dimensions are innitely large. this is indeed a correct
interpretation as we will see shortly. for a complete anal-
ysis of the eective (3 + 1)d spectrum, it is convenient
to make a change of variables h = (n+2)/2h, in terms
of which the linearized equations are

in order to determine the spectrum of 4d masses, we

where  labels the eigenfunctions. all of the important
physics follows from a qualitative analysis of this poten-
tial and parallels the story with one extra dimension.
the potential has a repulsive piece which goes to zero

for pj |zj|  l, and a sum of attractive  functions. we

already know that the 4d massless graviton corresponds
to a bound state with the wavefunction (numerical fac-
tors will be omitted in all that follows)

bound  (n+2)/2.

(16)

since the potential falls o to zero at innity, we will also
have continuum modes. since the height of the poten-
tial near the origin is  k2, the modes with m2 < k2

3

will have suppressed wavefunctions, while those with
m2 > k2 will sail over the potential and will be unsup-
pressed at the origin. in order to see the physics more
explicitly, suppose we place a test mass m on the in-
tersection at (x = 0, z = 0), and ask for the gravita-
tional potential u (r) at a distant point on the intersec-
tion (|x| = r, z = 0). to do this, we simply insert a
source gn (4+n)m 3(x)n(z) on the rhs of eqn.(13), and
straightforwardly solve the equation to nd

in the second line we have separated the bound-state
from the continuum contributions. it is straightforward
to evaluate the suppression of |(0)| for modes with
ml < 1, but this is not needed for the discussion of the
limiting behaviour of u (r). consider rst large distances
r  l. even with no suppression of the continuum
modes for ml < 1, the continuum sum would yield the
(4 + n)d potential gn (4+n)/rn+1, which is sub-dominant
to the term generated by the 4d graviton bound state for
r  l. therefore, for r  l,

u (r)

(18)

on the other hand, for distances r  l, it is the con-
tinuum modes with ml  1 which dominate, and these
have unsuppressed wavefunctions at the origin. there-
fore, for r  l, we just get the (4 + n)d potential

u (r) 

gn (4+n)m

rn+1

.

(19)

this point was not discussed in [3], as they were only
interested in checking the r  l behavior. of course, a
precise treatment is needed to understand the details of
the cross-over between these limits. however, the qual-
itative behavior is exactly what we would expect by in-
terpreting l as a compactication radius. this is in
accordance with the intuition that, while the extra di-
mensions are innitely large, gravity is localized to a re-
gion of size l around the intersection of the branes. the
mechanism of localization is realized by the branes re-
pelling all graviton modes with bulk momentum smaller
than 1/l but greater than zero away from the intersec-
tion, to distances of size l. as a result, inside of this re-
gion gravity becomes weak and the resulting planck scale
can be many orders of magnitude larger than the funda-
mental scale. the length scale l is determined by the
bulk cosmological constant , and given our ignorance
regarding the cosmological constant problem, we do not
feel any strong prejudice forcing l to be of the order of
the fundamental scale m 1
. we will simply treat l as a
parameter; we know only that l must be smaller than 
1 mm from the present-day gravity measurements.



dard model, perhaps along the lines of [9]. we intend to
pursue these issues in future investigations.

for l  m 1


, the phenomenology seems to be very
similar to conventional large extra dimensions of size l,
but there is a dierent theoretical perspective. in partic-
ular, the problem of stabilizing the radius at large values
is replaced here with explaining the tiny bulk cosmolog-
ical constant and brane tensions. furthermore, there do
not seem to be any very light moduli elds associated
with the large radius l.



another possibility motivated by the rst paper in [3]
is to stay with l  m 1
, and use the factor  to expo-

nentially generate the weak scale on our 3-brane, which
is placed a distance o(100)m 1
away from the the in-
tersection. unlike the proposal in the rst paper of [3],
this can be done with innitely large extra dimensions.
this is because in our case, 3-branes are tiny compared
to the (2 + n) branes setting up the gravitational back-
ground, so they are just like test particles probing the
background geometry. such a hybrid model has inter-
esting phenomenology. since the bulk is innitely large,
in contrast to the rst paper in [3] there is a continuum
of graviton modes, and they lead to a correction to the
newtonian potential on our brane  (tev)(n+2)r(n+1)
at all distances. this correction is irrelevant at large dis-
tances, but dominates the newtonian potential at dis-
p l  (tev)n+2rn. this
tances smaller than r where m 2
framework combines the interesting features of having in-
nitely large new dimensions, exponential determination
of the weak/planck hierarchy, strong gravity at the tev
scale and possible sub-millimeter deviations from new-
tonian gravity.

in sum, we have shown that gravity can be localized
to the intersection of orthogonal (2 + n) branes lying in
innite adsn+4 space. our solution naturally general-
izes the example with one extra dimension of [3,4]. it is
therefore possible to mask any number of innitely large
extra dimensions. furthermore, we pointed out that the
curvature l of the bulk ads space acts as an eective
compactication scale; the newtonian potential on the
intersection behaves as 1/r for r  l and 1/rn+1 for
r  l. among other things, this could oer new possi-
bilities for constructing theories with sub-millimeter ex-
tra dimensions.

a number of aspects of our set-up need to be further
elaborated. for instance, in the construction we have
assumed that there is no extra tension localized at the
intersection of the branes, e.g. we have not included pos-
sible 3-brane sources of the form n(z) in einsteins equa-
tions. it is important to determine how our solutions are
modied in the presence of such sources. there are obvi-
ous generalizations to intersecting branes with dierent
tensions or at general angles to each other, and we expect
that these will mimic the physics of anisotropic compact-
ication. there are many fascinating questions left to
ask, particularly in cosmology where interesting new is-
sues and possibilities have already emerged in the context
of sub-millimeter dimensions [68]. it is also interesting
to explore the extent to which the (now innitely large)
bulk can be used to address other mysteries of the stan-
