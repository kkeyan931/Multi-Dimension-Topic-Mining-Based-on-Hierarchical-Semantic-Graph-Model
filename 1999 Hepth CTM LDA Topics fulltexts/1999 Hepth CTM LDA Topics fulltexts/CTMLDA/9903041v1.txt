abstract

we derive the free osp(8|4) singleton action by sending the m 2 brane to the
minkowski boundary of an ads4  m7 background. we do this by means of the
solvable lie algebra parametrization of the coset space. we also give some comments
on singleton actions from membranes on ads4  g/h backgrounds.

1 introduction

for about a year now, there has been a revival of interest in supergravity vacua of the
form

ads  m ,

(1.1)

where ads is an antide sitter space and m a compact einstein manifold. this revival
started after maldacenas conjecture [1] of duality between kaluzaklein supergravity
theories in the bulk of antide sitter space and conformal eld theories on the boundary,

kk on ads / cft on ads .

(1.2)

since the proposal by gubser, klebanov, polyakov and witten for this duality [2], some
work is being done with the scope of testing this conjecture of holography. this has
brought the whole research area of branes and ads representations from the eighties back
alive.

of particular interest in testing this ads/cft duality is the singleton problem. rep-
resentations of ads algebras have been studied extensively in the past [3]. they are
characterized by a lowest energy and the total angular momentum. most of them have
a poincare analogue, except for some ultrashort representations which are referred to
as singleton representations. the most considerable property of these singletons is that
they can not be formulated as a eld theory on the bulk of the ads space. yet, singleton
actions exist, but can only be formulated if the singleton elds are restricted to live on
the boundary of ads. it has also been known for a long time how to get these singleton
actions and what they describe: namely, they describe the small uctuations of a brane
at the end of the universe [4]. all this has been known for about ten years. still, the
singleton has not been constructed explicitly from the brane until recently.
it is clear
that an explicit realization of this singleton at the end of the universe is an important
ingredient for testing the ads/cft conjecture.

thus, to nd the singleton from the super membrane one has to do the following:

1. consider the super membrane action that is invariant with respect to  supersym-

metry.

2. expand this action around a classical solution.

3. send it to innity.

as far as the rst step is concerned, membrane actions in an explicit background of
ads4  s7 have been constructed by our collaboration [5] and others [6]. here, we will
overview the construction of the membrane action and the derivation the singleton action
in this background, as it was done in [5]. however, before carrying out this programme
let us point out that the singleton theory that is retrieved on this space is quite trivial
and doesnt yield a proper test for the ads/cft correspondence. therefore one has to
consider the singleton problem on other nontrivial backgrounds. suitable backgrounds
for this are given if one replaces the sphere by other coset manifolds g/h. a complete
classication of these backgrounds for d = 11 is already know and these spaces have been
thoroughly studied in the eighties [7]. they are in onetoone correspondence with the

1

g/h freundrubin compactications. also, the number of preserved supersymmetries
n are known.

of all these coset spaces, the case of the round and squashed seven spheres are the
best known (corresponding to n = 8 [8] and n = 1 near horizon supergravities) but in
the eighties the kaluzaklein spectra have been systematically derived also for all the
other solutions using the technique of harmonic expansions [9]. the organization of these
spectra in supermultiplets is known not only for the round s7 [10] but also for the case
of supersymmetric m pqr spaces

m pqr 

su(3)  su(2)  u(1)
su(2)  u(1)  u(1)

,

where p, q, r  z dene the embedding of the u(1)2 factor of h in g. for p = q = odd
we have n = 2, in all the other (non supersymmetric) cases we have n = 0. the n = 2
multiplet structure was obtained in [11]. at present a group in torino [12] is doing the
harmonic analysis on the socalled stiefel and n 010 manifolds as well.

since much is known and will be known about these spaces, they constitute an excellent

laboratory to make direct checks of the holographic correspondence.

lets now clarify the qualitative dierence between the seven sphere and the other
g/h spaces. for a g/h space that admits n supersymmetries, the isometry group is
factorized as follows:

g = g  so (n) ,

where so (n) is the rsymmetry of the orthosymplectic algebra osp (n|4), while the fac-
tor g is the gaugegroup of the vector multiplets. correspondingly the threedimensional
worldvolume action of the cf t must have the following superconformal symmetry:

osp (n|4)  g

,

(1.3)

where g is a avor group. in the maximal case the harmonics on s7 are labeled only by
rsymmetry representations while in the lower susy case they depend both on r labels
and on representations of the gauge/avour group g. the structure of osp(8|4) super-
multiplets determines completely their rsymmetry representation content so that the
harmonic analysis becomes superuous in this case. the eigenvalues of the internal lapla-
cians which determine the kaluzaklein masses of the osp(8|4) graviton multiplets or, in
the conformal reinterpretation of the theory, the conformal weights of the corresponding
primary operators, are already xed by supersymmetry and need not be calculated. in
this sense the correspondence (1.2) is somewhat trivial in the maximal susy case: once the
superconformal algebra has been identied with the super-isometry group osp(8|4) the
correspondence between conformal weights and kaluzaklein masses is simply guaranteed
by representation theory of the superalgebra. on the other hand in the lower susy case
the structure of the osp(n|4) supermultiplets xes only their content in so (n) repre-
sentations while the kaluzaklein masses, calculated through harmonic analysis depend
also on g labels. in this case the holographic correspondence yields a denite prediction
on the conformal weights that, as far as superconformal symmetry is concerned would be
arbitrary. explicit verication of these predictions would provide a much more stringent
proof of the holographic correspondence and yield a deeper insight in its inner working.
however in order to set up such a direct verication one has to solve a problem that was
left open in kaluzaklein supergravity: the singleton problem.

2

in the remainder of this text we will restrict ourselves to the membrane on the seven
sphere. the case of the cosets with lower supersymmetry is currently under investigation.
to avoid any confusion, we would like to stress here that we call singleton eld theory
the at space limit of the free eld theory of [13, 14]. we point out that, since we are going
to nd a theory living on a threedimensional minkowski space rather than on s2s1, we
have no scalar mass term which was instead required in [13, 14] for conformal invariance.
we will see that it can also be derived as the theory living on the solitonic m2 brane.

2 the supermembrane on ads4  s7
we consider the space ads4  s7, with given metric,

des2 = 2(cid:16)dt2 + dx2 + dw2(cid:17) +

1
2 d2 + 4d2
7 ,

(2.1)

with coordinates,

(cid:26)   ]0,[
t, w, x  ],[

,

and d2
7 is the metric of the seven sphere. this is the near horizon geometry of the m2
brane [15]. moreover in [16] it was shown that this is a stable quantum vacuum of of the
11d supergravity. the ads superspace is dened as the following coset

ads(8|4) =

osp(8|4)

so(1, 3)  so(8)

and it is spanned by the four coordinates of the ads4 manifold and by eight majorana
spinors (i.e. they have 32 real components) parametrizing the fermionic generators of the
superalgebra.

this space can be described by means of a super solvable lie algebra parametrization.
to see what this solvable lie algebra parametrization is, lets have a look at the familiar
union jack root diagram of c2, which is the complexication of so(2, 3) shown in
gure 1. the fermionic supercharges form a square weight diagram within this gure,
and the supertranslation algebra is then simply that the anticommutator of two fermions
is given by vector addition of the corresponding weights in the diagram. the diagram can
in fact be seen as a projection of the full osp(8|4) root diagram, since the so(8) roots
lie on a perpendicular hyperplane, and so on this diagram they would be at the centre.
it is now easy to see that the generators in the box {s, , , d}, form a super

solvable lie algebra with nonzero (anti) commutation relations,

{s, s}   ,

[d, s]  s ,

[d, ]   ,

(2.2)

since its second derivative is zero. the coset representative is now obtained by exponenti-
ating the product of these generators with the coordinates of the coset space. we choose
to write the coset representative as l = lf lb with

lb = exp(d) exp(2x + t(+ + ) + w(+  )) ,
lf = exp(cid:16)a

2(cid:17) ,

the fermionic weights by squares. the dilatation charge of horizontal planes in the diagram are
on the left, while the worldvolume theory interpretation of the planes of generators are labelled
to the right. the supersolvable algebra is the boxed subalgebra.

where , x, t, w, a are the bosonic and fermionic coordinates. from the left invariant
form,

one derives the vielbeins2,

notice that, due to the (anti) commutation relations (2.2) of the solvable lie algebra
parametrization, the exponentiation (2.3) only contains a nite number of terms. hence,
it immediately follows that the vielbeins are at most quadratic in their anticommuting
coordinates. for a discussion on this see [5, 18].

another convenient feature of the solvable lie algebra parametrization is that one
projects out half of the spinors. this is equivalent to the projection of the symmetry
operator and thus at this stage the  symmetry has already been xed.

2 for the fermionic coordinates the following notation is understood: a = a 0 and

(2.5)

this parametrization of the manifold gives rise to the metric (2.1).
to complete the parametrization of the target superspace one still has to dene the
vielbeins of the seven sphere. to do so, we call ya the seven coordinates of the sphere and
write in stereographic projection coordinates:

e a = a

m

dy m
1 + y2 .

(2.8)

beside the  symmetry we also x the threedimensional worldvolume dieomor-

phisms imposing the static gauge choice. to obtain static solutions we have to identify

i  (t, w, x),
where i = 0, 1, 2, is the curved index of the brane.

for the action of the membrane we get:

s = 2z qdet(hij) d3 + 4!4!z b ,

the isometries of (2) can be calculated explicitly in this parametrization. as was

3 the singleton action from the supermembrane

in order to retrieve the osp(8|4) singleton action we now have to do the following. first
we consider a classical solution of the action (2.10),

i  (t, w, x),

(3.1)
3 where i = 0, 1, 2, 012 = 1 and i j = diag{ + +}. the sevendimensional gamma matrices  a are
the generators of the so(7) cliord algebra and a are the eight real killing spinors on the seven sphere.
for details on the conventions see [5].

 =  = const ,

i ya = 0,

a = 0,

then expand the transverse coordinates to the brane around the values for this classical
solution. for this we use normal coordinates. thus we write

3

3

 =  + 
ya = 
a = 

2e ,
2eya ,

2 a ,

3

(3.2)

where e,eya, a represent the uctuations and  is the membrane tension. thus the

action (2.10) gets the following expansion as a power series in :

with

l =

2 l(n) ,

 3(n2)

xn=0
l(0) = 0 = l(1) ,

(3.3)

(3.4)

(3.5)

and we are to recover the singleton action from the order 1 term

l(2) =

1
4

ijie je + ijieya jey

bab  2 3 aiiai
i .

the nal step is to send the brane to the boundary of ads. the boundary of ads lies at

   and

  0 ,

(3.6)

which is a conformally compactied minkowski space (see one of the appendices in [5]). it
is already clear from the form of the action (3.5) that in order to take one of these limits

one has to rescale the elds e,eya and a. in fact, a proper analysis of the supersymmetry

variation, which we do not present here but can be found in [5], shows us that these
rescalings have to be done according to

 = 

using the notation

the action (3.5) becomes

2 a,

ey a = eya.
ep = e
2) ,
y a ( ep
, ey

4

l = 4 ij iy aj y a  2 aii a .

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

clearly, this action has the right form to become the singleton action. yet, for generic
values of  it does not. to see this, lets look at the dilatation symmetry of the action
(2.10). the transformation (2.13) can only become a symmetry of the action (2.10) if we
place the brane at the boundary.

so we conclude that the singleton is found after putting the brane at the boundary of
the antide sitter space and that the singleton eld theory describes the centre of mass
degrees of freedom of the m2 brane.
