a general calculational method is applied to investigate symmetry relations among divergent
amplitudes in a free fermion model. a very traditional work on this subject is revisited. a sys-
tematic study of one, two and three point functions associated to scalar, pseudoscalar, vector and
axial-vector densities is performed. the divergent content of the amplitudes are left in terms of
ve basic objects (external momentum independent). no specic assumptions about a regulator is
adopted in the calculations. all ambiguities and symmetry violating terms are shown to be associ-
ated with only three combinations of the basic divergent objects. our nal results can be mapped
in the corresponding dimensional regularization calculations (in cases where this technique could
be applied) or in those of gertsein and jackiw which we will show in detail. the results emerging
from our general approach allow us to extract, in a natural way, a set of reasonable conditions (e.g.
crucial for qed consistency) that could lead us to obtain all ward identities satised. consequently,
we conclude that the traditional approach used to justify the famous triangular anomalies in per-
turbative calculations could be questionable. an alternative point of view, dismissed of ambiguities,
which lead to a correct description of the associated phenomenology, is pointed out.

i. introduction

quantum field theory is nowadays our main tool for the investigation of the elementary particle interactions. this
is also due to the fact that it allows us to study the consequences of symmetries assumed relevant, our fundamental
working hypothesis. since this is seldom possible, in an exact way, perturbative techniques become most relevant.
unfortunately, this type of solution is plagued with mathematical problems coming from divergent integrals. therefore
we are forced to have the recourse of auxiliary techniques based on regularization schemes in order to extract the
physical content of calculated amplitudes. however, the regularization schemes invariably modify the amplitudes, as
they are dictated by feynman rules, and consequently provide only a particular interpretation for the mathematical
indenitions in the problem. frequently, the nal results become regularization-scheme dependent and may not
reect the full dynamical content of the underlying theory. in this context two of the main issues are the question
of ambiguities associated with arbitrary momentum routing in loops and the symmetry relation violations [1]. many
of these fundamental questions have been adequately solved after the construction of dimensional regularization
(dr) [2]. there is however one important issue which, due to the mathematical limitation of the technique, could
not be handled, namely, the pseudo-amplitudes. perhaps this is the reason why even nowadays the treatment given
to such amplitudes have the recourse of methods completely discarded in all cases where dr applies. we refer
specically to the problem of triangle anomalies, which has been discussed in the pioneer work of gertsein and jackiw
[1]. they proposed that the ambiguous character of the amplitudes is associated to the existence of violations in
symmetry relations. in their analysis, the surface terms associated to eventual shifts relating two dierent choices
for the internal (arbitrary) momentum routing, play an important role. in spite of the relative success of this recipe
there is a deeply frustrating aspect involved, namely, the assumption that the space-time homogeneity (translational
invariance), one of the most basic symmetry implemented in the construction of quantum eld theories, is lost in the
perturbative calculations. in addition, the predictive power of such theories are aected because in cases where the
amplitudes assume degrees of divergence higher than logarithmic this means that no unique answer can be obtained
[3]. to decide by one of the innite possible expressions for a physical amplitude we need some knowledge about the
phenomenology or, in other words, to choose a value for each ambiguity involved. but there are some situations where a
completely healthy amplitude cannot be accessed by choosing ambiguities. this is exactly the situation of the triangle
anomalies [4]. this point of view, introduced by gertsein and jackiw [1], before the advent of dr technique, remains
as the accepted one even in modern quantum eld theory text books [5], [6]: the violation of symmetry relations
(anomalies) in perturbative calculations is associated to the divergent (ambiguous) character of the amplitudes. this
is a completely discarded picture in all other situations involving divergences in perturbative evaluations of physical
amplitudes. anomalies, in other hand, are shown to emerge even in theories dismissed of divergences [6], [7] and
predicted by several arguments in qft [6], [8]. it seems to have no doubt about their existence. so, if there is a
fundamental quantum phenomenon of the nature associated to anomalies [9], it must be present even in exact solutions

1

of the theory (dismissed of innities and ambiguities). therefore it is reasonable to believe that it must be possible to
establish their existence without having to appeal to ambiguities, even in perturbative calculations where divergent
amplitudes are involved.

ambiguities and symmetry violations in perturbative calculations, in other hand, remain as unsolved questions
even for many others than anomaly problems. discussions involving these aspects can be copiously found in the
recent literature in dierent contexts but playing a crucial role in the job of the qft theoretical methods description
of a particular phenomenology. in the case of eective non-renormalizable models, like njl model [10], ambiguities
and symmetry violations are deeply related with the own predictive power of such models [11]. investigations on
this subject have pointed out that usual procedures like dr, sharp cut o and pauli-villars cannot oer acceptable
results [12]. more recently the role of ambiguities have emerged in the context of lorentz and cpt violations in an
extended version of standard model [13]. perturbative evaluations of the radiative contributions to a lorentz and
cpt breaking coupling of the pure photon sector of an extended qed, of the chern-simmons form, are veried to be
regularization-scheme dependent and plagued by the ambiguities. in addition many aspects of the discussions about
the controversy involving the chern-simmons shift are closely related to that of av v anomaly once the mathematical
structure of the (divergent) contributions are completely similar [14]. explicitly evaluation of the radiatively induced
chern-simmons term using dr [15], dierential regularization [16] and surface term evaluation [14], among others
[17], cannot lead us to a denite value, i.e., only an ambiguous value can be extracted using traditional techniques.

ambiguities, symmetry relation violations and regularization-scheme dependence are also present in the aim of the
investigations about the implications of the fermionic tensor densities for low energy hadronic observable, a completely
new physics [18].

all the above cited problems, and certainly others omitted here, constitute strong indications that additional
investigations on the subject of ambiguities, symmetry relation violations and regularization-scheme dependence in
perturbative calculations are in order. in light of these statements we have devoted this work to the investigation of the
ambiguities and symmetry relations in a free (dirac) fermion model. this is not more than an amplied revisiting to
this question in a closely related way with the study that was done by gertsein and jackiw in ref. [1], a historical paper
on this subject. our intention is to use a general calculational method to manipulate and calculate the divergent
integrals in such a way that all amplitudes in dierent theories and models are handled by the same prescription
and connections with conventional techniques could be established. a such alternative strategy to manipulate and
calculate divergences in perturbative calculations have been proposed [19] and successfully applied in the treatment
of the ambiguities and symmetry relation violations in the context of the gauged njl model [20] and to investigate
the possibility of a radiatively induced chern-simmons shift in an extended version of qed [21]. this method so far
has proved to be an adequate tool to treat all questions related with divergences from the renormalization of standard
theories like qed [22], calculation of renormalization group coecients [23] and, for calculations in eective non-
renormalizable theories [19]. having this in mind we turn attention in the present work perhaps to the historically
most relevant question that involves the association between the violation of symmetry relations and ambiguities.
the advantage of the method adopted here is that it allows an immediate connection with other current approaches.
in particular, we can use the consistent results obtained by dr, where it applies, as element of the analysis for
the search of an universal interpretation for the divergences in physical amplitudes. from the theoretical point of
view an adequate description of the anomaly phenomenon, and any other in the perturbative calculations, is only
achieved if for identical mathematical objects an identical value is attributed in all situations where it occurs. in this
context, it is most desirable to obtain the anomalies in a natural way within a context which treats all anomalous
and non-anomalous amplitudes according to the same scheme. in this direction the rst step is the verication if the
current traditional approach used to justify the triangle anomalies produces results in a consistent way with those
of dimensional regularization where both procedures could be applied. one must check whether the current way as
followed in ref. [1] for calculating e.g. the famous axial anomaly remains appropriate when used to investigate other
symmetry relations. in other words, anomalies must also emerge in a treatment designed to consistently handle all
other amplitudes, i.e., where ambiguities are not necessarily present, in spite of the divergent character.

after detailed results have been obtained, in the point of view of our general calculational method, we will show
that the results can be mapped separately in those corresponding of dimensional regularization and to those of
surfaces terms analysis of ref. [1], but these two prescriptions are conicting, i.e., cannot be simultaneously mapped
by an universal interpretation. an important aspect involved in this investigation is that when we demand a complete
mapping of our results (in 4-d) with those of dr we obtain a set of conditions which are not compatible with any
symmetry violations, even for the anomalous cases. this is an indication that the procedure adopted in ref. [1] to
establish the triangle anomaly cannot be considered as a consistent one. we conclude that this is due to the fact
that only two-point functions are explicitly calculated in the traditional procedure and the violation of symmetry
relations in the anomalous amplitudes are intrinsic properties of the three-point functions involved. a consistent
calculation of the av v and aaa amplitudes reveals that the violations of the ward identities characterizing the
anomaly phenomenon emerges, in a natural way, with the expected value, without having to admit ambiguities and

2

within an interpretation which is universal in a sense that consistent results are obtained for all amplitudes in the
same point of view [19].

as discussed before we consider the free fermion model of ref. [1] but discarding internal symmetries, which are
irrelevant for our purposes. in section ii we dene the model, notation and relevant ward identities. in section iii
we briey establish the operational strategy for the manipulation and calculation of divergent amplitudes. in section
iv a study of ambiguities is presented in one and two-point functions calculated explicitly with arbitrary momentum
routing. we also explicitate the ambiguous terms of the three-point functions. in section v we reproduce (from our
results) those of ref. [1]. in section vi we discuss ward identities. the nal remarks are contained in section vii.

ii. definitions, notation and current algebra results for the model

we start introducing the notation to be used and dening the quantities we will be concerned with for the rest of

the work. we closely follow ref. [1] with which we compare our results.

let us consider a spin 1/2, mass m free fermion model. there will be therefore a massive eld which obeys diracs

equation and with which we can construct currents ji(x) dened by

where i are the diracs matrices responsible for the transformation properties of the currents:

i = [1; 5; ; i5],

ji(x) = (x)i(x),

(1)

(2)

characterizing the scalar s(x), pseudo-scalar p (x), vector v(x) and axial-vector a(x) densities, respectively. tensor
densities will be considered elsewhere [28]. an important property in this model is the value of the four divergences

and their commutation relations at equal times [1]. with the above denitions and the fermionic propagator

v(x) = 0

a(x) = 2mp (x),

(cid:26)

isf (p) =

i

6 p  m

,

it is possible to construct n-point functions, which we dene in the same way as in ref. [1] as follows

 one-point functions:

 two-point functions:

t i(k1, m) =z

d4k

(2)4 t r(cid:26)i

1

[(6 k+ 6 k1)  m](cid:27) ,

t ij(k1, m; k2, m) =z

d4k

(2)4 t r(cid:26)i

1

[(6 k + 6 k1)  m]

j

[(6 k + 6 k2)  m](cid:27) ,

 three-point functions:

t lij(k1, m; k2, m; k3, m) =

j

[(6 k + 6 k2)  m](cid:27) ,

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

and so on. here the k1, k2 and k3 represent the arbitrary choices for the internal momenta of the loop. energy
momentum conservation only requires these quantities must be related with the external momenta, e.g., in the three-
point functions we have: k3  k1 = p, k1  k2 = p and k3  k2 = q.

in our notation the vertex to the left is assumed to be connected with the initial state with external momentum
q and the vertex operator l. the other two vertices correspond to nal states with external momenta p and p and
the vertex operators i e j, respectively. besides the upper indices are associated, in the order they appear, with

3

the respective lorentz indices in the same order, whenever is the case. as an example, if l = , i = i5 and
j = 5 we have

t v ap



(k1, m; k2, m; k3, m).

(8)

this notation emphasizes the masses and momenta carried by the internal lines and characterizes each diagram
completely. in particular this means that in the case we have one particle in the initial state and two on the nal one,
symmetrization in the nal states will be required. for example for the process s  v v we dene the corresponding
amplitude as

t sv v



= t sv v



(k1, m; k2, m; k3, m) + t sv v



(l1, m; l2, m; l3, m).

(9)

the rst term represents the direct channel and the second the crossed channel. in the second term l1, l2 e l3 are the
arbitrary choices for the corresponding internal momenta.

there are integral representations for the functions dened above with the fourier transform of the currents

in the case of two-point functions, and

< j1(q)j2(q) >z eipxd4x < 0|t (j1(x)j2(0)|0 >,

< j1(p)j2(p)j3(q) >z eipxeipyd4xd4y < 0|t (j1(x)j2(y)j3(0))|0 >,

(10)

(11)

for the three-point functions. with these elements and the standard methods of the current algebra [1], [4], one can
establish relations among the n-point functions, i.e., ward identities. for the simple model in question such symmetry
relations are reduced to the conservation of the vector current and the well-known proportionality of the divergence
of the axial current and the pseudoscalar one. it is important to remark that such relations are exact and should be
satised in spite of the divergent character of up to n-point functions.

this brief discussion summarizes the dilemma one has to face when calculating divergent amplitudes: to maintain
their properties after the calculation. it is our purpose to investigate under which conditions it is possible to evaluate
these amplitudes and to get consistent results in what concerns ambiguities and symmetry relations.

the ward identities that we should verify are the following

iii. calculational strategy to manipulate divergent integrals

for the verication of the above cited ward identities it becomes necessary some explicitly evaluation of the
divergent amplitudes. in face of the well-known mathematical indenitions involved we need to adopt some strategy to
handle this problem. the usual procedure is the adoption of a regularization scheme or any equivalent philosophy. for
the following calculations we will adopt an alternative strategy. rather than the specication of some regularization,
to justify all the manipulations, we will assume the presence of a regulating distribution only in an implicitly way.
schematically:

z

d4k

(2)4 f (k) z

d4k

(2)4 f (k)( lim

gi(cid:0)k2, 2

i(cid:1)) =z

(48)

is are parameters of the generic distribution g(2

here 
integral, we require two very general properties of g(2
to lorentz invariance maintenance, and a well-dened connection limit should exists, i.e., lim2
the rst property imply that all odd integrands vanishes. the second one guarantees, in particular, that the value of
nite integrals in the amplitudes will not be modied. in the next step we manipulate the integrand of the divergent
integrals by using identities to generate a mathematical expression where all the divergences are contained in external
momenta independent structures. this goal can be achieved by the use of an adequate identity like:

i , k2). in addition to the obvious niteness of the modied
i , k2); it should be even in the integrating momentum k, due

 gi(cid:0)k2, 2

i(cid:1) = 1.

(49)

where ki is (in principle) an arbitrary momentum. the minor value of n should be the one that leads the last term
in above expression to a nite integral, and then, in face of the connection limit requirement, the corresponding
integration can be performed without restriction. the divergent structures obtained this way have no additional
assumptions and (in the discussed problem) they are written as a combination of ve objects, namely:

(54)

with this strategy, it became possible to map the nal expressions obtained by us into the corresponding results of
other techniques, once all the steps are perfectly valid with reasonable regularization prescriptions, including those
of dr. all we need is to evaluate the divergent structures obtained with the specic philosophy which we will make
contact. in addition we call attention to the fact that no shifts will be used on the general routing assumed for all
amplitudes. consequently it will be possible to make contact with those results corresponding to explicit evaluation of
surfaces terms in eventual shifts performed in the integrating momentum of the loop integrals [1]. this very general
character of the adopted strategy will become the most important ingredient for the analysis we want to do and to
support our conclusions. another important aspect of the procedure is that a denite value for each divergent integral
involved is attributed. this value is used always that the integrals are present in a physical amplitude in all theories
and models, providing, in this way, an universal point of view for the problem. no expansions, limits or not totally
controlled procedures are included. all the manipulations and calculations we need in treatment of divergences in
qft is performed without the explicit calculation of a divergent integral as become clear in what follows.

6

iv. ambiguities

the integral representation, eq.(5), for one-point functions indicates, by power counting, that there is a cubic
degree of divergence. also, eq.(6) reveals that the two-point functions are quadratically divergent and eq.(7) indicates
a linearly one for the three-point functions. in the point of view adopted in ref. [1], all these quantities are, in principle,
ambiguous quantities. the reason for this resides on the fact that the energy-momentum conservation relations do not
uniquely specify the internal momenta in the loop. it is possible to make dierent choices for the internal momentum
label. such choices could only be equivalent if shifts in the integrating variable were allowed, which is not the case
when the degree of divergence is higher than logarithmic [5], [6]. in what follows we will explicitly evaluate one and
two-point functions in detail from the point of view of our general calculational method. for the three-point functions
only the potentially ambiguous terms are explicitly showed as required for the analysis we want to do, closely related
to that of ref. [1]. all calculations will be made adopting general routing for the internal momenta in such a way all
possible choices are automatically included. after that all desired results have been obtained and a mapping to those
of ref. [1] produced, we will analyze all possible ambiguities. an amazing simple structure for these ambiguities will
emerge so that immediate and transparent conclusions can be extracted.

a. one-point functions

we start by considering the one-point vector amplitude t v

 . according to the standard denition this function

contains one fermionic propagator and the vertex operator i = . it is dened, following our notation, as

and, after the trace is taken, we get

t v

 =z

(2)4 t r(cid:26)

(k + k1)2  m2 + k1z

d4k
(2)4

1

(k + k1)2  m2(cid:27) .

(55)

(56)

from the above equation we see that we get two divergent integrals, one of cubic and the other of quadratic degree
of divergences. following our strategy we admit the presence of an implicit regulator, as discussed before. in order
to indicate its presence we use the subscript  in the integral and proceed to the necessary manipulations of the
integrand in such a way that the dependence on k1 momentum is present only in nite integrals in which case the
connection limit is invocated. this goal can be achieved by the use of the identity eq.(49) choosing n not minor than
three for the cubic divergent integral above. proceeding on this way we get:

(k + k1)2  m2 = k1(cid:26)z

(57)

note the absence of the odd integrals in consequence of the even character of our implicit regulator and that we have
removed the subscript  on the two last integrals in consequence of the connection limit requirement. the nite
integrals so obtained can be solved by standard techniques without any restriction. the result is an exact cancellation
between them.

for the quadratic divergent integral in eq.(56) we apply the same recipe. choosing in the eq.(49) the value n = 2

we get

where, again, the last two integrals cancel out after that the integration have been performed. then, collecting the

where we have introduced a set of dierences between divergent integrals with the same degree of divergence, dened
in eqs.(50)-(52). as announced on the preceding comments we will analyze the results only after all calculations have
been performed. for while we only call the attention for the very general character of the assumptions we have made
to produce the result eq.(59). no specic assumptions about a regulator are used and no shift, limits, expansions and
so on involving the divergent parts are assumed. this is due to that, in fact, no calculations of divergent integrals
have been made.

let us now treat the remaining one-point functions within the same calculational scheme. taking the scalar one,

dened by

we get, after diracs trace,

t s =z

(59)

(60)

the quadratically divergent integral in the above expression has already been discussed in the previous calculation.
in consequence the one-point function t s can be written as

t s = 4m(cid:8)iquad(m2) + k1k1(cid:9) .

(61)

in the above result we verify that the amplitude t s is expressed in terms of two divergent objects, iquad(m2) and
, the latter again related to the arbitrary momentum label k1. for the moment we only comment that the two
calculated amplitudes are potentially ambiguous due to the presence of such terms in the nal expression.

it is a simple matter to check that the remaining one-point functions t a

 and t p vanish identically due to the

traces properties of the diracs matrices involved.

b. two-point functions

let us calculate the two-point functions within the same scheme. we start by considering the simplest one of such

where k1 and k2 stand for the arbitrary choices for the internal momenta. only the dierence between them is a
physical quantity, the external momentum, consequently other combinations than the dierence in the result for the
two-point functions will systematically locate ambiguities, wherever the case may be. after taking dirac traces and
some standard algebraic manipulations we get

c. three point functions

we now come to the three-point functions. in order not to overload the text we limit ourselves in writing, in the
explicit way, only the terms indicating possibility of ambiguities. this is sucient for the analysis we want to do,
closely related to that performed in ref. [1]. to illustrate what we mean, consider a relatively simple case of three-point

in the above expression we note that only the rst two terms are potentially ambiguous. the remaining ones are either
logarithmically divergent or nite, all with unambiguous coecients. of course it is possible to solve all integrals and
obtain an analytical expression for t v ss
[19]. but, for our immediate purposes, it is enough to write it in the form



t v ss



= 2(k2 + k3)[] + n at,

(97)

where nat stands for non-ambiguous terms. having this in mind we simply list the other three-point functions in
the same manner;

t v p p



= 2(k2 + k3)[] + n at,

with only one lorentz index we have also

on the other hand, with three lorentz indexes;

t sap



= 2i(k1 + k3)[] + n at.

 , which possesses the

t v aa

 (cid:12)(cid:12)at

=  t v v v

 (cid:12)(cid:12)at

(103)

the remaining three-point functions are all unambiguous, although divergent, therefore are left out of the discussions.
let us now establish contact between our results and those obtained by gertsein and jackiw showing that it is a

simple matter to go from our formalism over to theirs.

v. ambiguities in gertsein and jackiw approach

let us now understand how the results obtained in the previous section include those of ref. [1] as a special case.
we show that starting from our expressions we can obtain the results in tables i and ii for the ambiguities in the
two and three point functions as dened by those authors in section iii of ref. [1]. we start with our results for
the amplitude t v s
given by eq.(80). in the adopted notation the ambiguity has been introduced via the arbitrary
momenta k1 and k2, by calculating the amplitudes with internal momenta in the loop: k + k1 and k + k2 in the two
propagators in question, as dened in eq.(6). in ref. [1] the arbitrariness is represented by the momentum s, such that
the propagators have momenta k + s and k + s + p which establish the equivalent relation



(cid:26) k1 = s

k2 = s + p.

in this way, the ambiguous part of the t v s



amplitude can be cast into the form

(111)

(112)

(113)

(114)

in the case of the three-point functions, in order to obtain the results of ref. [1] it is necessary to take the su(3)
indices into account in the calculation of the amplitudes, since they play an important role in the construction of
currents. the gell-mann matrices introduce symmetry factors such as relative global signs between the direct and
crossed channel, which are not present in our non-abelian model. however this does not introduce any inconsistency
in the two formulations, as we will see.

the arbitrariness in the label for the internal momenta of the loop is introduced by taking

s = ap + bp,

(115)

where a and b are real numbers. the ambiguity is then found by means of calculating the dierence between two
representations for the three-point functions: with and without the arbitrary label s dened above. in this sense
we see that it can be interpreted as a surface term, which would disappear if shifts in the integration variable were
allowed.

following this prescription, the ambiguous term of t sap



previously found in the form

for the direct channel (without su(3) factors) may be written as

t sap



|at = 2i(k1 + k3)

t sap



|at =

22
(2)4 (ap + bp)

which, after the inclusion of the crossed channel and the pertinent factors yield

t sap



|at =

22
(2)4 (a  b)(p  p).

in a completely analogous way we get

t v ss



|at = t v p p



|at =

i22
(2)4 (a  b)(p  p),

t aaa



|at = t av v



|at =

22
(2)4 (b  a)(p  p),

and nally

t v v v



|at = t v aa



|at =

2i2
3(2)4 (b  a) {g(p  p) + g(p  p) + g(p  q)} .

the above demonstrations show us, as enounced, that our calculational technique produces results mappeable in
others specic procedures. let us now verify the ward identities involved.

vi. ward identities

we next proceed to the verication of the free fermion model symmetry relations presented by eqs.(12)-(47). such
relations were obtained formally by contracting the lorentz index of a vertex with the respective external momentum.
there are in principle two ways to verify ward identities involving n-point functions. the rst is to contract the
integral representation, before evaluating traces, generating in this way a function with the same number of points as
the contracted one more two others with a number of points lowered by one unity. only the former ones are in fact
evaluated explicitly [19]. this is the strategy used in ref. [1] to analyze ward identities. the second way involves the
explicitly evaluation of the n-point function in question and afterwards contracting the results with the appropriate
external momentum, identifying then all others functions present in the investigated ward identities. obviously the
eort associated is much higher in the second option once all functions involved needs to be evaluated explicitly. we
will analyze in this work both possibilities for two-point functions and only the rst one for the three-point functions.

a. one-point functions

the rst ward identity to which we refer in section ii involves t v

 . a vanishing value for this amplitude is predicted
in qed by furrys theorem, for example. from the result produced by our treatment, eq.(59), we see that in order to
obtain a denite zero value for the t v
 amplitude in such a way that the result is independent of the arbitrary choices
for the internal momentum the following conditions need to be satised:

2 = 0
 = 0
 = 0.

(122)




which we will denominate consistency conditions [24] from now on. since all terms of t v
 in eq.(59) are ambiguous,
requiring relations eqs.(122) the amplitude turns unambiguous and symmetry preserving. as will be shown in what
follows they are necessary and sucient conditions to save all other amplitudes from ambiguities and symmetry
violations.

b. two-point functions

we now study the ward identities for the two-point functions. let us, initially, consider the contraction of t v s



with the external momentum (k1  k2)

(k1  k2)t v s

 =z

d4k

(2)4 t r(cid:26)1

1

[6 k+ 6 k2  m]

(6 k1  6 k2)

1

[6 k+ 6 k1  m](cid:27) .

before calculating the trace we use the following identity

(6 k1 6 k2) = [6 k+ 6 k1  m]  [6 k+ 6 k2  m],

so that

(k1  k2)t v s

 =z

d4k

(2)4 t r(cid:26)1

1

[6 k+ 6 k2  m](cid:27) z

d4k

(2)4 t r(cid:26)1

1

[6 k+ 6 k1  m](cid:27) .

(123)

(124)

(125)

comparing now with eq.(60) we identify two scalar one-point functions. it is clear that the vector current will only
be conserved if there is no dependence on k1 and k2 in this one-point functions. however, using the result in eq.(62)
for t s we get

(k1  k2)t v s

 = 2m [(k1 + k2)(k1  k2) + (k1  k2)(k1 + k2)] .

(126)

we can, on the other hand, also check the validity of the identity by the contraction of (k1  k2) with the expression
obtained for t v s

 , eq.(80):

(k1  k2)t v s

 = 4m(k1  k2)(k1 + k2)[].

(127)

16

in any case the identity can be satised provided  = 0, which renders t s unambiguous and t v s


one can check from eq.(62) and eq.(80). let us now study the case of axial-pseudoscalar amplitude t ap
eq.(72). firstly we do the following

zero, as
 , dened in

(k1  k2)t ap

 =z

d4k

(2)4 t r(cid:26)5

1

[6 k+ 6 k2  m]

i(6 k1 6 k2)5

[6 k+ 6 k1  m](cid:27) ,

and introduce the identity

(6 k2 6 k1)5 = [6 k+ 6 k2  m]5 + 5[6 k+ 6 k1  m] + 2m5

in the interior of the trace, which leads us to

(k1  k2)t ap

 = 2mit p p  iz

d4k

(2)4 t r(cid:26)1
[6 k+ 6 k2  m](cid:27) .

[6 k+ 6 k1  m](cid:27)

substituting the results previously obtained for the one-point function we obtain

(k1  k2)t ap

 = 2mit p p  2mi(cid:8)4iquad(m2) + 2[k1k1 + k2k2](cid:9) .

had we, on the other hand, taken eq.(72) and contracting it with (k1  k2), we would have gotten

(k1  k2)t ap

 = 4mi(k1  k2)2(cid:26)ilog(m2) (cid:18) i

(4)2(cid:19) z0(m2, m2, (k1  k2)2; m2)(cid:27) ,

from which we could get

(k1  k2)t ap

 = 2mi(cid:8)4iquad(m2) + 2(k1  k2)2ilog(m2)

2(k1k1 + k2k2)}

(4)2(cid:19) (k1  k2)22z0(m2, m2, (k1  k2)2; m2)

(cid:18) i
2mi(cid:8)4iquad(m2) + 2(k1k1 + k2k2)(cid:9)

this results agrees with eq.(132) provided we identify, in the rst term, in curly brackets, the expression for t p p , as
we can see from eq.(71).

let us next take the amplitude t av

 which has two lorentz indices and has two ward identities connected to it,

one for the vector index and other for the axial one. for the vector current we have

(k1  k2) t av

 =z

d4k

d4k

(2)4 t r(cid:26)i5

[6 k+ 6 k1  m](cid:27) ,

(134)

where we immediately identify the one point axial functions which vanish identically and therefore (k1  k2)t av
doing the same for the axial current we have

 = 0.

(128)

(129)

[6 k+ 6 k2  m](cid:27)

d4k

[6 k+ 6 k1  m](cid:27) ,

so that

z

(k1  k2)t av

 = 2mi[t p v



],

yielding the expected result for the ward identity in eq.(17). however the amplitude t p v
given traces properties, which immediately implies with (k1  k2)t av

is also identically zero
 = 0. if we take the four-divergence directly



17

in eq.(83) it is easy to see that (k1  k2)t av
section.

 = 0 and (k1  k2)t av

 = 0. we will analyze these results in the next

the case of the amplitude t v v


is analogous. if we rst perform the contraction

(k1  k2)t v v

[6 k+ 6 k2  m](cid:27)
[6 k+ 6 k1  m](cid:27) ,

d4k

1

(137)

we again see that the result will depend on the t v

 one-point functions. substituting now their expressions we get

(k1  k2)t v v

 = 4n(k1  k2) + (k1k1k1  k2k2k2)

(k2

(cid:27)

(138)

the conservation of the vector current demands, therefore that the r.h.s. be identically null. it is easy to check that
similar results would have been obtained if we had taken the four-divergence directly on the nal result for t v v
 ,
eq.(91). this shows that in order to satisfy the ward identities relative to the t v v
 amplitude we need to require the
same conditions as for the one-point function, eq.(123).

last we turn to t aa
to the amplitudes t ap
with (k1  k2) we get



 . associated to this greens function we have two axial currents. this allows us to relate them
and t p p by successive contractions with the external momentum. thus, upon contracting

(k1  k2)t aa

 = 2mi[t p a



] +z

where the two last terms are again vector one-point functions and we get

.

similar results emerges if the contraction is performed with the expression in eq.(95). therefore it is veried that the
conditions under which the ward identities are satised are the same as the previous ones. in order to obtain the
identity from eq.(20) it is enough to contract, once more, with the index . however nothing new is produced.

c. three-point functions

we next turn to the question of the verication of ward identities involving three-point functions. we will use only
the rst way pointed out in the introduction of this section, i.e., by relating the contracted functions with two-point
functions, following gertsein and jackiw [1].

let us consider the identity for the amplitude t v ss

. contracting the  vector lorentz index with the external



momentum of the vertex;

(k3  k2)t v ss



=z

d4k

(2)4 t r(cid:26)1

1

1

[6 k+ 6 k2  m]

(6 k3 6 k2)

1

[6 k+ 6 k3  m](cid:27) ,

which can be written after the use of the identity

(6 k3 6 k2) = (6 k+ 6 k3  m)  (6 k+ 6 k2  m)

(141)

(142)

in the form:

18

(k3  k2)t v ss



d4k

(2)4 t r(cid:26)1

(2)4 t r(cid:26)1

d4k

1

[6 k+ 6 k2  m](cid:27)
[6 k+ 6 k3  m](cid:27) ,

1

1

[6 k+ 6 k1  m]

where one can identify scalar two-point functions i.e.,

(k3  k2)t v ss



(k1, m; k2, m; k3, m) = t ss(k1, m; k2, m)  t ss(k1, m; k3, m).

(143)

(144)

looking at eq.(70) we verify that the amplitude t ss possesses unambiguous terms.
means terms which depends on dierences (k1  k2)2 and (k1  k3)2 which are the external momenta p
respectively. explicitly the dierence in eq.(145) can be written as

in the above expression this
2 and p2,

(k3  k2)t v ss



(k1, m; k2, m; k3, m) =

2(cid:26)(4m2  p
2)(cid:20)ilog(m2) (cid:18) i
 (4m2  p2)(cid:20)ilog(m2) (cid:18) i

(4)2(cid:19) z0(m2, m2, p
2; m2)(cid:21)
(4)2(cid:19) z0(m2, m2, p2; m2)(cid:21)(cid:27)

+2(k2k2  k3k3).

(145)

now we need to include the crossed channel. redening adequately the momenta of the external lines and operating
in an analogous way we nally arrive at

(l3  l2)t v ss



(l1, m; l2, m; l3, m) =

2(cid:26)(4m2  p2)(cid:20)ilog(m2) (cid:18) i
2)(cid:20)ilog(m2) (cid:18) i

(4)2(cid:19) z0(m2, m2, p2; m2)(cid:21)
2; m2)(cid:21)(cid:27)
(4)2(cid:19) z0(m2, m2, p

 (4m2  p

+2(l2l2  l3l3).

the sum of the contributions of the two channels yield the following expression for the searched ward identity

qt v ss



= 2(k2k2  k3k3) + 2(l2l2  l3l3).

this result shows that the conservation of the vector current depends in this case on the dierence .

for the amplitude t v p p



we nd, proceeding in a complete similar way as the previous case,

qt v p p



= 2(k3k3  k2k2) + 2(l3l3  l2l2).

still with one lorentz index we have the process a  sp for which we write rst

(k3  k2)t asp



=z

5

1

[6 k+ 6 k2  m]

i(6 k3 6 k2)5

1

[6 k+ 6 k3  m](cid:27) .

now, making use of a convenient identity

(6 k2 6 k3)5 = 5[6 k+ 6 k3  m] + [6 k+ 6 k2  m]5 + 2m5,

(146)

(147)

(148)

(149)

(150)

we can identify on the r.h.s. the two-point functions t p p and t ss, besides t p sp . substituting the results for them
with inclusion of the crossed channel, we have

qt asp



= 2mi[t p sp ]  2i(k3k3  k2k2)  2i(l3l3  l2l2),

(151)

where the symmetry violating terms are again associated with ambiguities.

the cases with two lorentz indices are now in order. making use of the two-point functions t v s

 , for t sv v

 we get

for the two associated ward identities

pt sv v



= 4m(k3  k1) + 4m(l1  l2)
= 8mp

(152)

19

and

t sv v
p



= 4m(k1  k2) + 4m(l3  l1)
= 8mp

.

(153)

in this results it is important to note an unambiguous character for the violating term. this means that the identity
depends on the value of  and this is not associated with ambiguities here.

for the s  aa process, which has two related axial currents we get

and

pt saa



= 2mi[t sp a



]  4m(k2 + k3)  4m(l2 + l3)

t saa
p



= 2mi[t sap



]  4m(k3 + k2)  4m(l3 + l2),

(154)

(155)

which can be, in principle, violated by  with ambiguous coecients.

let us now look to the process v  ap . in the case of the vector current, the identity is expressed in terms of the

two-point functions t ap

 , which are unambiguous. upon inclusion of the crossed channel we promptly obtain

on the other hand, the identity related to the axial current yields

qt v ap



= 0.

pt v ap



= 2mi[t v p p



]  4m(k2 + k3)  4m(l2 + l3).

(156)

(157)

the two identities related to t p v v
identically. thus



are satised without restrictions since the two-point functions involved vanish

and

(k3  k1)t p v v

 = 0

(k1  k2) t p v v

 = 0.

also for the processes v  as and p  aa both ward identities are satised by the same reason. thus

and

also

pt sav



= 2mit sp v



 t sav
p



= 0.



(cid:26) pt p aa

t p aa
p



= 2mit p p a
= 2mit p ap
.





(158)

(159)

(160)

(161)

(162)

we are now left with the amplitudes with three lorentz indices. in the case of t v v v


the identities are expressed

in terms of the two-point functions t v v

 and we obtain

qt v v v



= [(k1 + k2)(k1 + k2)  (k1 + k3)(k1 + k3)] [2  g  g  3g]

+ [(l1 + l2)(l1 + l2)  (l1 + l3)(l1 + l3)] [2  g  g  3g]

+

2
3

[k1(k3  k2)  k1(k3  k2) + l1(l3  l2)  l1(l3  l2)] [2 + g + g] .

(163)

similar expression for pt v v v
and 2.in the case of the t v aa
standard operations,





t v v v

and p
can be obtained. all conditions are expressed in terms of 
amplitude we have analogous results. for the vector current we nd, after the



(k2  k3)t v aa



(k1, m; k2, m; k3, m) = t aa

 (k1, m; k2, m)  t aa

 (k1, m; k3, m)

(164)

20

and in consequence of the eq.(95), we may identify

qt v aa



= qt v v v



.

for the axial currents, in other hand, we set rst

(k3  k1)t v aa



= 2mit v p a



+ t aa

 (k1, m; k2, m)  t v v

 (k3, m; k2, m)

(165)

(166)

using now the results eq.(91) and eq.(95) and adding the contribution of the crossed channel, we set

pt v aa



= 2mit v p a



+ [(l1 + l3)(l1 + l3)  (l2 + l3)(l2 + l3)] [2  g  g  3g]
 [(k1 + k2)(k1 + k2) + (k2 + k3)(k2 + k3)] [2  g  g  3g]

+

2
3

[k2(k1 + k3)  k2(k1 + k2) + l3(l1  l2)  l3(l1  l2)] [2 + g + g] .

(167)

a completely analogous condition can be obtained for the other axial current involved in t v aa

.



now we can nally investigate those associated to anomalous ward identity. first, for the av v amplitude,

contracting with (k3  k2) before taking the traces, and using the identity

(6 k2 6 k3)5 = (6 k+ 6 k2  m)5 + 5(6 k+ 6 k3  m) + 2m5

(168)

we get

(k3  k2)t av v

 = 2miz d4k

d4k

[6 k+ 6 k3  m](cid:27)

(169)

which is the usual procedure [1], [4], [5], [6].

on the right hand side we can easily identify the three-point function p v v and a pair of two-point functions av .
substituting the appropriate value for two-point functions involved, eq.(83), and adding the corresponding crossed
channel we obtain for the ward identity

qt av v



= 2mi[t p v v



]

+2 [(k1  k3)(k1 + k3) + (k2  k1)(k1 + k2)] 
2 [(l1  l3)(l1 + l3) + (l2  l1)(l1 + l2)] 

(170)

for the vector currents, rst we contract with (k3  k1) momentum, the direct channel, and make use of the identity

(6 k3 6 k1) = (6 k+ 6 k3  m)  (6 k+ 6 k1  m),

(171)

to obtain the relation

(172)

again the value assumed by av two-point function is crucial to dene the value of the right hand side of the above
equation. using the results obtained in our calculation we get, after the addition of the crossed channel results,

pt av v



= +2 [(k2  k1)(k1 + k2) + (k3  k2) (k2 + k3)] 

+2 [(l3  l1)(l1 + l3) + (l2  l3)(l2 + l3)] .

(173)

in a completely analogous way, we arrive at the expression, for the other vector current involved;

21

t av v
p



= +2 [(k3  k1)(k1 + k3) + (k2  k3) (k2 + k3)] 

+2 [(l2  l1)(l1 + l2) + (l3  l2)(l2 + l3)] .

(174)

we repeat then the procedure for the three ward identities associated to t aaa

 . in this case, the contraction with

the external momenta give rise again to two-point functions t av

 which, after some manipulation, yields

qt aaa



= 2mit p aa



+2 [(k3  k1) (k1 + k3) + (k1  k2)(k1 + k2)] 
+2 [(l3  l1)(l1 + l3) + (l1  l2)(l1 + l2)] 

and, in a completely analogous fashion,

pt aaa



= 2mit ap a



2 [(k1  k2)(k1 + k2) + (k3  k2)(k2 + k3)] 
+2 [(l3  l2)(l1 + l3) + (l1  l3)(l1 + l3)] .

finally, for the last ward identity, we get:

t aaa
p



= 2mit aap



+2 [(k1  k3)(k1 + k3) + (k3  k2)(k2 + k3)] 
+2 [(l3  l2)(l2 + l3) + (l1  l2)(l1 + l2)] .

let us now proceed the nal analysis of the preceding investigations.

(175)

(176)

(177)

vii. final analysis

for a free 1/2 fermion, with equal masses, we have established the symmetry relations involving the divergent
one, two and three-point functions. we next explicitly calculated, with arbitrary choices for the internal momenta
of the loops, one and two-point functions and evaluated the potentially ambiguous part of the three-point functions.
all the calculations have been performed from the point of view of a general calculational method in which only
general assumptions are made in respect of an eventual regulator taken in an implicit way. no explicit calculations
of a divergent integral are performed. in the result for the specic divergent integral, once no shifts are assumed,
the results corresponding to other techniques are still maintained. to map these results into specic procedures
all we need is to interpretate or evaluate the divergent terms according to the desired philosophy.
in particular
we have shown in the section v that the results corresponding to the traditional reference on this subject are still
present in our results and a complete mapping is immediate. we are then at the position to analyze all the results
looking at them and having in mind a searching for an universal interpretation of the possibilities of ambiguities and
symmetry relation violations. in particular we are worried to answer the question: the justication of the anomaly
phenomena can be consistently given in terms of ambiguities associated with (physically irrelevant) choices for the
internal momenta (breaking of translational invariance)?. our main argument to expect a negative answer to this
question resides on the fact that if the anomalies are fundamental quantum phenomena therefore they must not be
conditioned or justied in terms of divergences aspects, since, if the exact solutions were possible, then the description
of the dynamics of the interacting particle would not involve divergences and, consequently, ambiguities. in other
words, we believe that the ambiguities are typical consequences of the perturbative solution approach, as well as the
innities are, and a consistent interpretation of the perturbative amplitudes should leave no room for ambiguities
like the renormalization process needs to eliminate all the divergences to furnish physical amplitudes. any consistent
treatment of the mathematical indenitions associated to divergent integrals, from the physical point of view, needs
to automatically eliminate the ambiguities. let us now come from what we believe to what we obtain strictly from
the point of view of the mathematical treatment.

we rst note that in all calculated amplitudes the ambiguous dependence on the internal arbitrary momenta are

always coecients of only three combinations of divergent objects, with the same degree of divergence. they are

(179)

(180)

the second crucial observation is that all violating terms are also combinations of these objects but not all of them
possess ambiguous coecients. this means that even if shifts were allowed without restrictions the violating terms
would be not completely removed. this statement is deeply related to the success of the dimensional regularization
technique, which is well-known for producing amplitudes in a consistent way in respect ambiguities and symmetry
relations.
it is very easy to verify that in dr the objects 2,  and  vanish identically in such a way that all
ambiguous and symmetry violating terms are automatically removed. note that it is not sucient to authorize shifts
but it is necessary that the properties between divergent integrals, which we denominate consistency conditions, are
assumed by the method because these aspects are not always associated. so, to obtain a perfect map from our result
to those corresponding to dr calculations it is sucient to eliminate 2,  and  and to evaluate the objects ilog(m2)
and iquad(m2) from the point of view of that technique (taking the apropriate value for the traces of the  matrices
tr() = 2g and so on). the niteness part is perfectly mapped one-by-one. these identications are strictly
possible for the amplitudes that can be obtained in 2 dimensions ( = continuum and complex), i.e., to the cases
where the number of the 5 involved matrix is not an odd quantity [25]. at this point it is not possible to run
away from the observation: from our result it is possible to recover the dr results, where this technique could be
applied, assuming 2 =  =  = 0. it is also possible to recover the surface term evaluations of the gertsein-jackiw
approach in which case the result for 2,  and  cannot be zero. if we follow the way guided by dr philosophy,
in what concerns the interpretation of the divergent objects, then we have obtained, from our general approach, all
ward identity satised and all ambiguities are removed by the same condition that leads to this fact. then the
triangle anomaly phenomenon cannot be justied in a consistent way based on the divergent character of the involved
amplitudes (ambiguities). if in the other hand we follow the gertsein and jackiw procedure then violations in ward
identities of av v and aaa amplitudes are obtained but a hard price must be paid because the ambiguities and
violations would propagate to many other amplitudes which is a very undesirable feature of qft in general, once
renormalization become a very complicated scheme to be achieved in this fashion.

another aspect involved in the gertsein-jackiw justication of the triangle anomaly phenomenon, which is quoted
in many textbooks of qft even nowadays [5] [6], is that the source of the violating term (anomaly) resides strictly
on the value to be assumed by the av two-point function. this approach needs a nonzero value for this physical
amplitude. this is a clearly inconsistent statement from many aspects of the qft features. first, if the av amplitude
does not vanish identically, it possesses two conserved currents: an axial-vector and a vector one, once we had:

(ki  kj)t av
(ki  kj)t av

 (ki, m; kj, m) = 0
 (ki, m; kj, m) = 0,

(181)

which is not consistent with the symmetry content of the model, in the sense that, to justify the violation of a
symmetry relation we rst need to violate another one, in such a way it is not possible to decide what is the
fundamental symmetry breaking phenomenon. a second aspect is related to the unitarity. if the av amplitude does
not vanish it needs to develop an imaginary part when the external momentum is (k1  k2)2 = 4m2 (cutkoskys
rules). the value attributed to av amplitude by the gertsein-jackiw approach is not compatible with this qft
perturbative aspect.
in addition, a cpt breaking may be introduced because the transition between a vector to
axial-vector particle seems to be possible if the av two-point function becomes a nonzero quantity. now we return
again to specic analysis of our calculations.

in the present context, the analysis of the results, regarding the ambiguities and symmetry relations, resulted rather
transparent, once we look all the conditions through the three consistency conditions above cited. concerning this
two aspects we can state what follows:

 ambiguities

in all amplitudes the dependence arbitrary choices of internal momenta of loops appear simply as coecients
for the dierences between divergent integrals, eqs.(178)-(180). given this fact the conclusion is immediate: all
the ambiguities will be eliminated if they are simultaneously zero. however, it is not surprising that ambiguities
could be eliminated if shifts were allowed, i.e., provided we ignore the corresponding surfaces terms, as we can
see observing the conditions (123). conversely, from this point of view, the conclusion can be looked as 4-d
conditions to be satised by any regularization prescription which should have the consistency of dr whenever
it applies. but this is not the whole story.

23

 ward identities

in our investigations we have found several examples in which ambiguities and symmetry violations are intimately
connected and have the same origin. however, there were also several instances in which ward identities could
be violated by unambiguous terms with the same structure of the relations in the eqs.(178)-(180). this is the
case, for example, of t v v
 , where the dierence  appears with an unambiguous coecient. also
the three-point functions t sv v
and t saa
involve the dierence  as a condition for the fulllment of the
corresponding ward identities. the dierence 2 would also appear with an unambiguous coecient for the
four-point function t v v v v

, among others, as it can be easily checked.

 and t aa







we could then invert the analysis starting precisely by these amplitudes and extracting the conclusion that, inde-
pendently of ambiguities, the objects 2,  and  should be obtained as zero in a consistent treatment. we
would then, a posteriori, verify that these conditions eliminate all sources of ambiguities.

at this point we reach an important and quite surprising result: following the strategy of gertsein and jackiw in
ref. [1] to study ward identities, which has historically been used to justify violations of symmetry relations, we found
a set of conditions which allows all the wi to be satised. in this context the possibility of making use of ambiguities
for any purpose is automatically eliminated. by imposing these referred conditions, the corresponding results of dr
can be immediately mapped whenever it can be applied. those corresponding gertsein and jackiw results, as we have
shown in section v, can be equally obtained from our results but not with the same interpretation for the objects
2 ,  and  .

the situation is now the following: to establish or justify the existence of the anomaly phenomena, in the context of
perturbative calculations, we need to use a specic prescription to evaluate some divergent integrals. the traditional
one, based on surface terms, could be used, in principle, to treat all the amplitudes for any theories, but it is discarded
nowadays where the dr can be applied and it is accepted only for the treatment of pseudo-amplitudes where the dr
cannot be used due to its natural limitation. the two treatments lead to results that cannot be mapped one into
another for places where both can be applied. if we are looking for an universal way to treat all divergent amplitudes
in qft, the above situation is unacceptable.

we arrive at two deeply dierent options: rst, if we adopt the interpretation corresponding to the surface terms
point of view we can get a picture for triangle anomalies that corresponds to the one of the gertsein an jackiw,
but, in consequence, we will plague all physical amplitudes with ambiguities and consequently loose the translational
invariance, the main one of the basic space-time symmetries implemented in the construction of qfts. second, if
we adopt the dr interpretation for the objects 2,  and  we will have all symmetry relations satised,
including those considered as anomalous.

this statement is an immediate consequence of our strategy in looking at perturbative calculations involving
divergent amplitudes; the consistency conditions make immaterial an eventual choice for the value of undened
quantities, because in all places of occurrence they are multiplied by dierences between divergent integrals of the
same degree of divergence, that need to be identically zero by construction.

once we have concluded that there is no chance of consistency in calculations involving divergent integrals without
the imposition of the consistent conditions, a crucial question emerges: do the combination of the treatment given to
the divergent integral plus the strategy of gertsein and jackiw to verify ward identities in three-point functions, lead
to the conclusion that there are no anomalies in triangle diagrams? the answer is: not necessarily. the conclusion of
our investigation, which at this point becomes transparent, is that this kind of analysis is not completely consistent,
because we can nd conditions that produce exactly the opposite conclusion of the initial intentions.





and t p v v

and not with the value for a two-point function, t av

what is then the correct procedure to discuss this problem? our expectation resides on the explicit calculations for
the three-point functions and contracting them with the momenta only after the calculations are performed to generate
ward identities. the correct violation values for symmetry relations (anomalies) required by phenomenological reasons
like the neutral pion decay, need to emerge in a natural way, free from ambiguities related to the arbitrary choices
of internal labels. the anomalous term needs to be associated with intrinsic properties of the involved three-point
functions t av v
 , which needs to be identically
zero by many reasons. this is actually the essential point of the sutherland-veltman paradox [26] that states the
impossibility to obtain simultaneously the three ward identities satised and the correct value for the amplitude av v
in zero axial vertex momentum by a smooth limit. in the calculations here performed, and many others cited, these
ingredients are not present and it is not reasonable to extract a conclusion about the triangle anomaly phenomenon.
in fact a work along these lines has been performed and a manuscript where all details involved in a completely
general analytic calculation is in preparation [27]. some results can be anticipated to give support to our nal
expectations and suppositions. after all the necessary calculations to give the most general analytic expression for
t av v
have been concluded, we can identify only one ambiguous term with the coecient . the contraction
with the external momenta gives us

which shows that in adopting the value suggested by our investigation,  = 0, we do not spoil the violation. in
addition we note that the value of the violating term is exactly that related to the limq0 qt av v
or that one we

need for the phenomenological adjustment on the a  v v amplitude to allow, the neutral pion decay with a correct
width. so, in the context of the sutherland-veltman paradox, if we choose an amplitude with a correct behavior on
the q  0 limit and simultaneously u (1) gauge invariant for all values of the external momenta then an anomalous
term should be included leading to the ward identities

then, the p v v amplitude in the right hand side of the eq. (188) can be identied as responsible for the neutral pion
decay. it is important to emphasize the main aspect involved; the resulting amplitudes were derived without having
recourse to ambiguities. the space-time homogeneity has been maintained. in addition the source of the anomalous
term resides in strictly nite terms and then it is not necessarily associated to properties of divergent integrals and
neither to the specic aspects of perturbative calculations. this is precisely what we should expect of a fundamental
quantum phenomenon: to be still present in the eventual exact solutions consequently not revealed to us by the
nature throughout the innities which are nothing more than a consequence of our inability in solving the equations
of motion of a qft in an exactly way. finally we call the attention that our results are in complete agreement with
what we need to construct the renormalization of the standard model by anomaly cancellation.
