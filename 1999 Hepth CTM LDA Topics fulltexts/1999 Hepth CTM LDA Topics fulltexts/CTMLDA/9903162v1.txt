abstract

we discuss a possible relation between singletons in ads space and logarithmic con-
formal eld theories at the boundary of ads. it is shown that the bulk lagrangian for
singleton eld (singleton dipole) induces on the boundary the two-point correlation func-
tion for logarithmic pair. bulk interpretation of mixing between logarithmic operator d
and zero mode operator c under the scale transformation is discussed as well as some
other issues.

the maldacena conjecture [1] about duality between string/m theory on adsd+1
backgrounds and conformal eld theory (cf td) at the boundary of anti de sitter space
one particular example is a duality between n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory
and iib superstrings (supergravity) on ads5  s5 which allows to obtain new exact
results in the large n limit of the strongly coupled superconformal gauge theory. the
conformal eld theory is realized as the world-volume theory of n coincident d3-branes
of type iib string theory. the near horizon geometry of this set of branes is ads5  s5
 and in the weak string coupling limit gs  0 type iib theory is described by a iib
supergravity. the classical description is valid when t hooft coupling g2
y m n is large and
string loop corrections become 1/n 2 corrections.

this conjecture was further developed in [4],[5] where very elegant expression for cor-
relation functions in cf td was given in terms of an action of bulk degrees of freedom in
adsd+1. a brief review of the ads/cf t correspondence and of the ideas that led to it
formulation is given in [6]. the recipe suggested in [4],[5] for the generating functional
of connected correlation functions in the cf td (using as an example n = 4 gauge the-
ory) is to identify it with an extremum (with the lowest action, when there are several
extrema [7]) of the classical supergravity/string action s[{i}] subject to the boundary
conditions for bulk elds i at the boundary of adsd+1 i(~x, z = zu v ) = i(~x). here
~x and z are coordinates in ads and non-zero zu v plays the role of the uv cuto in
a boundary theory[8], [4]. these boundary conditions determine coupling constants for
operators o(~x) in cf td and action obtained this way generates connected correlation
functions for conformal operators oi(~x) corresponding to bulk elds i(~x, z). the rela-
tion between cft correlation functions and the (super)gravity/(super)string bulk action
is the following:

*exp"xi z ddx i(~x)oi(~xi)#+cf t

= es[{i}]|i(ads)=i(~x)

(1)

this relation was used in many papers to calculate correlation functions. the 2- and
3-point functions were calculated in [4], [5], [9] which gave a spectrum of anomalous
dimensions for dierent conformal operators. the calculations of 4-point functions is
much more complex and these functions contain much more information about cft. in
several recent papers dierent aspects of the calculations of 4-point functions in n = 4
susy yang-mills from ads5 were discussed [10], [11]. in [10] it was done by studying

for references about near horizon geometry of p-branes see reviews [2], for a review on

d-branes see [3]

exchange diagrams with scalar and gauge elds in the bulk and in [11] using the r4 term
in string corrected type iib action [12]. it was found that these correlation functions
have a surprising property - there are logarithmic singularities when two operators on the
boundary approaches each other. it is necessary to stress here that in both cases there
were some missing terms which contributions may cancel logarithmic singularities. in a
rst case it was a graviton exchange diagram which contribution is still unknown, but
hopefully will be found soon (see [13] for a current status) and in the second case there
are unknown terms coming from the supersymmetric completion of the r4 term, which
also can give non-zero contribution to the four-point functions.

in this letter we would like to address a question about origin of this logarithmic terms
in case they will not disappear in the nal answer. let us consider some d-dimensional
cft and assume that in this theory there is a closed operator product expansion (ope)

a(x1)b(x2) x1x2 xi

f i
ab

|x1  x2|a+b i

oi(x2)

(2)

than a four-point correlation function can be expanded in s-channel x12, x34  0, for
example, as

ha(x1)b(x2)a(x3)b(x4)i = xij

abf j
f i

ab

xa+bi
12

xa+b j
34

hoi(x2)oj(x4)i

(3)

where two-point functions in the right hand side are non-zero only when i = j and

ha(x1)b(x2)a(x3)b(x4)i =

1
xa+b
xa+b
34
12

f (x)

(4)

where x = x12x34/x24x13. in the s-channel x  0 nontrivial part of a correlation function
is given by an expansion

f (x) = xij

cijf i

abf j

abxi

(5)

where cij is nonzero only when i = j and is determined by two-point functions <
oi(x)oj(0) >= cij/x2i. expansions in t- and u- channels can be obtained if the ope
is associative taking the limits x   and x  1. it is easy to see that f (x) has an
ordinary power expansion in x and can be written as f (x) = r d() exp(2lnx)

where density of states

() = xij

cijf i

to get a logarithmic singularity at small x one must have a rather bizarre density of states
()  1/(  0)2,   0, i.e.
innitely many states with dimensions arbitrarily
close to some threshold dimension 0. it seems that this is a very exotic behaviour for any
sensible theory based on ads/cft correspondence, because we have to admit an existence
of innitely many elds in the bulk with practically the same masses. this leads to a lot
of disasters, including innite entropy of the system. much more conservative approach
is to assume that logarithmic terms in f (x) can be explained only if we shall assume that
among the operators in the r.h.s. of ope (2) there are logarithmic operators. these
operators are an essential feature of the logarithmic conformal field theory (lcft)
[14] and appear when two (or more) operators oi in (2) are degenerate and have the same
anomalous dimensions. in case there are more than two degenerate operators, let say n,
there are also terms like ln2x, .., lnn1x in f (x). for any pair of degenerate operators c
and d (logarithmic pair) the hamiltonian becomes non-diagonalizable [14] and acts on
logarithmic states as

l0|c >= |c >,

l0|d >= |d > +|c >

(7)

where we used as an example two-dimensional notations when hamiltonian is a virasoro
operator l0. degenerate dimension for logarithmic pair is  and two-point correlation
function [14], [15] are given by

hc(x)d(y)i

= hc(y)d(x)i =

hd(x)d(y)i
hc(x)c(y)i

1

(x  y)2c

=

= 0

c

(x  y)2c

(2c ln(x  y) + d)

the ope expansion (2) also must be modied

a(x1)b(x2) x1x2

1

|x1  x2|a+b (d + c ln|x1  x2| + . . .)

the logarithmic terms in (8) and (9) immediately lead to ln x terms in f (x).

(8)

(9)

let us note that our knowledge about lcft is mostly based on two-dimensional
models, where a lot of models were studied (the full list of references includes more than
30 papers and full list can be nd in [16], for example) but the way how the two-point
functions were derived in [14], [15] does not depend actually on d and the structure of
two-point correlation functions for logarithmic pair is universal for any lcf td.

in the ads/cft framework the immediate questions to ask are the following

4

 what are the bulk elds corresponding to logarithmic operators ? what is so special

about these elds (because logarithmic operators are denitely very special).

 how does the jordan cell structure of logarithmic pair manifest itself in the bulk ?
 what is the bulk interpretation of the zero norm of c and mixing between c and

d under conformal transformations ?

the clue is that a logarithmic pair form an non-decomposable representation of con-
formal algebra (innite dimensional virasoro algebra in a two-dimensional case) and we
can look for objects which form a similar non-decomposable representation of so(d, 2)
in adsd. it is amusing that such objects are known for long time - they are singletons
[17], very special representations corresponding to a square root of ads massless rep-
resentations. they extension to supersymmetric case, supersingletons were discussed in
[18]. in the last year dierent aspects of (super)singletons were discussed in relation with
ads/cft correspondence [19] but without any relation to lcft. to see that singletons
lead to logarithmic correlation functions at the boundary we have to recall that the best
way to formulate a theory of free singleton elds in the bulk is in terms of a dipole eld
[20] which satises (dd + m2)2 a = 0 or

(dd + m2) a + b = 0,

(dd + m2) b = 0

and the respective bulk adsd+1 action is

s = z dd+1xg(cid:18)gab  m2ab 

1
2

b2(cid:19)

(10)

(11)

now we can repeat the same procedure as in [4],[5] and derive two-point correlation
functions for boundary operators c and d corresponding to dipole pair b and a. we
do not know yet what pairing it must be ac and bd or ad and bc and we shall see
later how the choice depends on the structure of green function matrix. at the boundary

of adsd=1 we have either coupling r ddx(a0d + b0c) or r ddx(a0c + b0d) where

a0 and b0 are boundary values for elds a and b. we also introduced a normalization
parameter  which we shall calculate later to have canonical normalization of logarithmic
operators as in (8). the dierence between this case and single scalar elds with mass m
is that instead of one green function k which was used as a boundary-bulk propagator
we have a matrix kij, i, j = 1, 2 now where index 1 corresponds to a eld and index 2
corresponds to b eld. using action (11 we can easily get a set of equations for green

5

functions kij by a standard procedure of adding sources and after simple calculations one
gets

(dd + m2)kaa + kba = 0,

(dd + m2)kbb = 0

(dd + m2)kab + kbb = 0,

(dd + m2)kba = 0

now we have two possibilities. the rst one is to assume that green function must be
symmetric kab = kba after which we can see immediately that kbb must be zero and
non-dioganal green functions solution for this system is a standard boundary-bulk green
function k for a scalar eld with mass m which was discussed in [5]

(12)

k(z, ~x; ~x) =

z++d

(z2 + |~x  ~x|2)++d

where + + d =  is the dimension of a conformal eld on the boundary. it is determined
by a scalar mass m and is the larger root of a quadratic equation

(  d) = m2,  =

to nd kaa we have to solve the equation

1

2 (cid:16)d + d2 + 4m2(cid:17)

(dd + m2)kaa = k

(14)

(15)

and to nd a solution we can use a following trick. let us note that [d/dm2, (dd +
m2)] = 1, because ads metric does not depend on a mass of scalar eld propagating in
the bulk. using the fact that (dd + m2)k = 0 one gets

k = [

d
dm2 , (dd + m2)]k = (dd + m2)

dk
dm2

(13)

(16)

(17)

and comparing with (15) we see that

kaa(z, ~x; ~x) =

dk
dm2 = 

1

2  d

ln  (z2 + |~x  ~x|2)

z

! k(z, ~x; ~x)

where we used (14) to get d/dm2 = (2  d)1. equation (17) is all what we need to
get logarithmic correlation functions on the boundary. the solution of classical equation
of motions are:

z

1

a(z, ~x) = z ddx
(z2 + |~x  ~x|2) b0(~x) 
2  d z ddx ln  (z2 + |~x  ~x|2)
!
(z2 + |~x  ~x|2) a0(~x)
b(z, ~x) = z ddx
(z2 + |~x  ~x|2) a0(~x)

z

z

z

(18)

the second possibility arises if we shall not restrict ourselves to have a symmetric

green function kij and the only another possible solution of (12) will be

kba = 0, kaa = kbb = k, kab =

dk
dm2

(19)

now kij matrix has a jordan cell structure with new obvious relations between bulk elds
and the boundary values. we shall call the rst choice symmetric (s) and the second
choice (19)-jordan (j).

the classical action can be evaluated by the same arguments as in the case of a single
free scalar eld using integration by parts and reduction to a surface term. let us show
how it can be done in symmetric (s) case. using (11) and equations of motion (10). we
shall demonstrate how this can be done for one can show that action can be expressed as
a surface integral

s(a0, b0) = lim
0

1

2 z ddxh(cid:16)a(~n  ~)b + b(~n  ~)a(cid:17)

(20)

where we take a regularized surface at z = , normal derivative is dened as ~n = z 
z and
h is an induced metric on the boundary with h = zd. one can show that dierentiating
the term ln(z2 + |~x  ~x|2) with respect to z will give us sub-leading term o() and after
straightforward calculations one gets

s[a0, b0] = z ddxz ddx a0(~x)b0(~x)

|~x  ~x|2 
# a0(~x)a0(~x)
|~x  ~x|2

1



2  d z ddxz ddx "ln |~x  ~x|2



! 

(21)

this is the nal result. using (1) we can now immediately extract the two-point functions
for conformal elds c and d and now it clear why logarithmic operator d must be
connected with eld a and zero mode operator c must be paired with a nakanishi-
lautrup eld b. we have

hc(~x)d(~y)i =

|~x  ~y|2

(22)

hc(~x)c(~y)i =

2s[a0, b0]

the standard normalization (8) can be obtained after choosing the factor  = 1/(2d)
which gives us immediately the constants c and d in (8)

c =




= (2  d) = 2 + m2,

d =

c


= 2  d = d2 + 4m2

(23)

let us note that limiting case  = d/2 arises when m2 = d2/4 and this is the lower
bound for the stable scalar led in adsd+1. we see that in this case all logarithmic
correlation functions become null, because c = d = 0 and at the same time coupling of
logarithmic operator d to eld a becomes innite.

in this letter we shall not present similar calculations for j case but it is easy to see
that we shall get the same structure of the two-point correlation functions, only with an

opposite pairing r ddx(a0c + b0d) so now it is eld a which is coupled to a zero-mode

operator c. the same parameter  stands in front of d operator in both cases and in
critical case  = d/2 it is innite coupling of logarithmic operator d to eld b.

here we considered only bosonic case, one can study supersingletons and get the
logarithmic superconformal theory, the details will be presented in a future publication.

let us note that a very similar action (the only dierence is the xed coecient in
front of b2 term), but without any relation to singletons was recently studied in paper
[21] in which logarithmic operators on the boundary were also found. however in that
paper only j case was considered with non-symmetric green function matrix kij. in a
subsequent paper [22] fermions were included in the construction using non-commutative
geometry. it will be interesting to see if there is a connection between non-commutative
geometry and supersingletons.

after we have established a link between singletons in adsd+1 and lcf td at the
boundary of adsd+1 and found an answer on the rst question we can try to answer the
questions about bulk interpretation of mixing between c and d, zero norm of c and
jordan cell structure. the conformal eld theory was dened on a regularized surface at
z = . making a scale transformation

z  z = zet,

  et

8

(24)

it is easy to see from the scale dependence of the correlation functions (23) that c and
d transform as:

d  d = d  tc
c  c = c

(25)

we have to treat s and j cases separately. in the s case the coupling is r ddx(a0d +

b0c) such transformation of operators c and d corresponds to the following transfor-
mation of singleton dipole

b  b = b + ta
a  a = a

(26)

it is unclear if such a transformation of the eld corresponds to any particular symmetry
of the bulk action and it is an interesting open question. in the j-case the coupling is of

the form r ddx(a0c + b0d) and one can get another transformation law for a and b

elds

a  a = a + tb
b  b = b

(27)

but this is precisely the symmetry of action (11) which variation under the transformation
a  a + cb, b  b is proportional to equation of motion and zero on-shell. one can
easily see this as a symmetry of equations of motion (10) - operator dd + m2 will
annihilate shift in a proportional to b due to the equation of motion for b eld. actually
this symmetry is nothing but part of brst symmetry of the singleton action after gauge
xing [20].

let us now address an issue what does singleton describe. it was suggested [23] that
they describe the small uctuations of a brane at the boundary of the ads space, i.e.
in case of ads/cft correspondence it is a d-brane.
if it is so there may be a very
unusual interplay between two dierent lcft. the rst one is the conformal eld theory
on a boundary we have just discussed. the second one may be a world-sheet conformal
eld theory describing (super)string in a d-brane background.
it was suggested some
time ago [24] that the world-sheet description of the collective coordinates of a soliton
in string theory is given by logarithmic operators. the problem of d-brane recoil was
studied from this point of view in [25]. it is an extremely interesting question if there

9

is any connection between these two lcft (let us note that the rst lcft is not two-
dimensional in general). to do this one must know a full superstring theory in ads
space with rr background. in a recent paper [26] ads3  s3 background was studied
and a world-sheet conformal eld theory was obtained which was based on a supergroup
su (2|2). the bosonic sector of this theory has a kac-moody algebra su(2)k  su(2)k
and in principle theories with negative k and susy wznw models often have logarithmic
operators in they spectrum ( see [24], [27] and references therein). it will be interesting
to see if these logarithmic operators will survive in the full superstring spectrum and if
they really describe the deformation of the boundary as was conjectured in [24].

another interesting question is do we have any place for logarithmic operators in n = 4
yang-mills ? in a recent paper [28] a very strange behaviour of n = 4 yang-mills theory
in the limit of small ads curvature was found from the hollographic connection between
gauge elds and gravity. the resolution of paradoxical behaviour suggested in this paper
was based on an assumption that there are a lot of hidden degrees of freedom which can
store information but can not carry energy density. it seems that the zero norm eld c
is well suited for this function and one can think about possible relation between these
conjectured degrees of freedom and logarithmic operators. another interesting issue is
possible relation between logarithmic operators and vacuum instability in the bulk, which
was found in another example of holography - gauge theories with chern-simons term
in three dimensions and two-dimensional lcft [29]. in this short letter we do not have
place to discuss these problems. these and other interesting questions about singletons,
topological eld theories, vacuum instabilities, holography and all that will be discussed
in a future.

i would like to thank h. liu, a. tseytlin and sanjay for interesting discussions and

valuable comments about logarithmic terms in 4-point correlation functions [10].
