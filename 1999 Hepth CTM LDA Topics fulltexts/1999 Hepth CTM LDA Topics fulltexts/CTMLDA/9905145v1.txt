abstract

we extend superspace by introducing an antissymetric tensorial coordinate and
develop the corresponding extended supersymmetric invariant theory. after inte-
grating over the tensorial coordinate, an eective action describing massive bosons
and fermions is explicitely derived for the spacetime dimension d = 2. the adopted
procedure is simpler than the kaluza-klein one and can suggest an alternative for
string compactications.

with the advent of strings we may conclude that fundamental physical theories
should be formulated in a spacetime dimension higher than four, say d = 10 or
d = 11. after some compactication mechanism, we reach the real word in four
dimensions. the main problem of this idea is that there is a large number of ways
that compactications can be done, each one corresponding to a dierent eective
theory. consequently, it is not clear what the fundamental theory should be.

there is another manner to put forward the interpretation that strings see, or ap-
parently see, spacetime with more dimensions than four. reporting back to bosonic
strings, we know the spacetime they see has dimension 26. however, when one con-
siders the spacetime also containing fermionic degrees of freedom (supersymmetry)
its critical dimension goes down to 10. keeping this line of reasoning, we could con-
sider that superspace has more degrees of freedom than vector bosons and fermions
in order to obtain a lower critical spacetime dimension. indeed, in the case of spin-
ning strings, when one introduces antisymmetric tensor degrees of freedom, we verify
that critical dimension is just four [1]. if we do the same for superstrings, we nd
quantization more subtle, but we can show that supersymmetry is only achieved also
for d = 4 [2]. we then emphasize that spacetime dimension can be actually four,
but the corresponding superspace contains more degrees of freedom than the usual
bosons and fermions. we stress that this procedure is dierent from the kaluza-
klein one [3], where the initial spacetime dimension is higher than the nal one
after compactication. as symmetry groups strongly depend on d, kaluza-klein
theories have to deal with the symmetry reduction in the compactication proce-
dure. in our approach, extra coordinates are introduced in an extended superspace
constructed over the usual spacetime (which is not compactied). consequently, its
symmetry group structure is not modied anytime.

considering that there is some parallelism between fundamental elds and co-
ordinates of superspace, the consistency of these ideas leads us to argue if antisym-
metric tensors elds might also exist as fundamental elds. in fact, we mention that
the interest for these elds dates back almost thirty years ago, starting from the
work by kalb and ramond [4], where antisymmetric tensor elds were introduced
as gauge elds that carry the force among string interactions. regardless if this fact
is true or not, this interest has been increasing since then. one of the reasons is due
to its particular structure of constraints, related to the reducibility condition. as a
consequence, the quantization of tensor theories deserves some additional care when
compared with the usual case of gauge theories of rank one [5]. we also mention
that antisymmetric tensor elds appear as one of the massless solutions of modern
string theories (even when tensor coordinates are not introduced), in company of
photons, gravitons, etc. [6]. another interesting feature of tensor elds is to provide
a possible mechanism of mass generation for gauge elds. this occurs when they
are coupled in a topological way to vector gauge elds [7, 8].

our purpose in this letter is to study with details an extension of the super-
symmetric theory when antisymmetric tensor coordinates are included. we show
that a consistent extension of the supersymmetric generator is attained by coupling
the independent matrix  with the translational generator in the tensorial sec-
tor. although this procedure is formally independent of the spacetime dimension,

we only develop the particular case of d = 2, due to its simplicity, by using the
scalar supereld formulation.
in the usual supereld language, fermionic coordi-
nates are integrated out to obtain a supersymmetric invariant action based on the
usual spacetime coordinates. we do the same with respect to the tensor coordinate
and discuss the eective action which is obtained. we left the four dimensional case
for a future work, specially the gauge sector, where algebraic complexities are much
bigger [9].

let us rst present an extension of the usual supersymmetry in an arbitrary
spacetime dimension d by taking an enlarged superspace given by (x, x, ),
where x is an independent antisymmetric tensor coordinate. the physical meaning
of such tensor coordinates may not be evident, but one can think that, as in the usual
fermionic case, they are introduced in order to construct extended supersymmetric
multiplets. we postulate that the extended supersymmetry transformations are
given by

x = i  
x = i 
 = 

(1)

where  is a majorana spinor (see appendix for details of the convention and nota-
tion, as well as some identities, we are going to use in this paper) and  is the char-
acteristic parameter of the supersymmetry transformation (also a majora spinor).

the charge generator for the transformations above is

q =

which leads to the extended supersymmetry algebra

{q, q} = 2i

characterizing an additional translation along the antissymetric tensor directions.

these results are valid in any spacetime dimension, but from now on we are
going to stay in d = 2 due to its simplicity. in this particular spacetime dimension,
the charge generator and the supersymmetry algebra turn to be

q =


 

+ i()

{q, q} = 2i

looking at the expressions for the charge operator and the supersymmetry al-
gebra in d = 2, we could, at rst sight, conclude that superspace in d = 2 with a
tensor coordinate, is equivalent to the usual superspace in d = 3. this is nonethe-
less true because y = x01, in d = 2, is a lorentz invariant quantity. consequently,
it could not be identied with x2 coordinate in d = 3.

let us now write a supersymmetric lagrangian for this extended superymmetric
transformation. the best way to do this is by starting from the supereld notation.
the general form of a scalar and real supereld in d = 2 reads

f

where the component elds ,  and f depend on x and y. the quantity  is
actually a supereld if it transforms as

 = ( q)

which leads to the following transformations for the component elds (all of them
real)

the simplest supersymmetric action with the supereld (6) reads

where the derivative operator d, that anticommute with q, is given by

in the usual case of supersymmetric theories, in supereld language, we integrate
over the grassmannian coordinates  and  to obtain the eective action in com-
ponent elds. in the present case, we have also to integrate out the coordinate y.
for the integration over the grassmannian coordinates, we get

one can easily verify that indeed eq. (11) is invariant under transformations (8).

with respect the y-coordinate, we consider it is not an unlimited variable like
x, but denes a circle of radius r. a consistency for this hypothesis is related
to the fact that y is an invariant quantity and, consequently, there is no problem
related with lorentz transformations. at this point we realize one of the problems
of dealing with a spacetime of higher dimensions [9]. let us consider the fourier
expansion

a(x, y) =

1
r



xn=

a

n (x) exp(cid:16)2in

r(cid:17)

(12)

where a is representing any of the component elds , , and f . since all of the
component elds are real, we have that the fourier modes must satisfy the condition

a
n (x) = a

n(x)

(13)

introducing the fourier expansion given by (12) into expression (11) and performing
the integration over y, we get an eective action in usual space-time spanned by the
vector coordinate x

it is interesting to note that for non zero modes both bosonic and fermionic elds
components are massive. as it is well known, a massive dirac fermion component
satises the massive klein-gordon equation as a consequence of the iteration of
dirac equation. so, if (i/ + m) = 0, then (i/ + m)(i/  m) = ( + m2) = 0.
in our case, the mode of order n with mass m = n/r satises the equation
(i/  im5) = 0, which also implies under iteration that (i/  im5)2 = ( +
m2) = 0. this is an expected result, since we verify that the equations of motion
for the fermionic massive modes are just the usual dirac equation with the dirac
matrices written with the aid of a similarity transformation given by the unitary
matrix u = exp(i 

4 5).

observe that the zero modes satisfy the usual supersymmetry, but extended super-
symmetries depending on the mass parameters n/r arise when the other modes are
taken in consideration. although its unusual origin (superspace with tensor degrees
of freedom), the eective theory describes an innite set of bosons and fermions
with the usual behavior in d = 2.
