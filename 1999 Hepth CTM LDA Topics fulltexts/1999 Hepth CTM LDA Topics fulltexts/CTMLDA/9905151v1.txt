abstract

2 m 22 + 

the general static solutions of the scalar eld equation for the potential v () =  1
4 4
are determined for a nite domain in (1 + 1) dimensional space-time. a family of real solutions
is described in terms of jacobi elliptic functions. we show that the vacuum-vacuum boundary
conditions can be reached by elliptic cn-type solutions in a nite domain, such as of the kink,
for which they are imposed at innity. we proved uniqueness for elliptic sn-type solutions
satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions in a nite interval (box) as well the existence of a
minimal mass corresponding to these solutions in a box.
we dene expressions for the topological charge, total energy (or classical mass) and en-
ergy density for elliptic sn-type solutions in a nite domain. for large length of the box the
conserved charge, classical mass and energy density of the kink are recovered. also, we have
shown that using periodic boundary conditions the results are the same as in the case of dirich-
let boundary conditions. in the case of anti-periodic boundary conditions all elliptic sn-type
solutions are allowed.

1. general solutions

in this paper we obtain static solutions of the classical equation of motion of a scalar eld
, with potential v () =  1
4 4 in a nite domain. static solutions with vacuum-
vacuum boundary conditions at x =  were rstly obtained by dashen et all (dhn)1.
however, our case may be important since, as far as we know, no general solution satisfying

2 m 22 + 

the same boundary conditions for the above potential was found in the literature in a nite

domain. also this has an evident connection with the casimir eect which attracted much
attention for its applications in several topics of physics 2.

let us consider the lagrangian density of a scalar eld theory in (1 + 1) dimensions given

by

l(, ) =

where v () =  1

the extrema of the potential v () are reached for

e = 0,

m =

(vacua).

we are interested in the static case  = (x). so the classical equation of motion is

xx 

v


= 0.

(1)

it is well known that the solutions for eq. (1), satisfying vacuum to vacuum boundary

conditions at , are given by

0(x) = 

m


tanh  m
2

(x  x0)! .

(2)

these solutions are called kink(+ sign) and anti-kink( sign). the solution 0 ap-
as x  , which correspond to a degenerate vacuum

proaches to two dierent values  m

conguration.

we now turn to the calculation of the static solutions of the classical equation of motion

(1) with boundary conditions in a nite domain which, in this paper, is a bounded interval. in
order to have well behaved solutions we impose our solutions belonging to class c 2(), where
   is an interval.

a rst integral of eq. (1), after a change of variable, is given by

x  x0 = 

1

m z

dz

qz4  z2 + c

2

,

(3)

where z =


2m

 is the dimensionless variable and x0, c are constants of integration.

since we are interested to nd real solutions of eq. (3), we must evaluate the integral of

3

right-hand side for (z4  z2 + c

2) > 0.

for any c, the stationary points of the function f (z) =

1z4z2+ c

2

are given by the values:

1
2
on the other hand, note that for c = 0 and c = 1

z = 0, 

.

2, the integral in eq. (3) is not dened at

these points. so, we discuss the following cases:

1) c  0,

2) 0 < c <

1
2

and

3) c

2

.

it is important to emphasize that we are interested to nd static solutions (x) that satisfy

the vacuum-vacuum boundary conditions, like the solution (2), but now in a nite domain and

to study some of their properties.

1) case c  0
in this case (z4  z2 + c

where cn(u, m) is a jacobi elliptic function 4,a the solution (6) is unbounded because cn
has zeros. observe that the functions cn1(u, m) are larger than or equal to 1 and since
. so the solutions given

q1 + 1  2c  2, then the value of c(x) is always larger than m

by (6) can not satisfy vacuum-vacuum boundary conditions.

as in the previous case the solution of the eq. (8) is given by

where sn(u, m) is a jacobi elliptic function 4. as in the previous case, this solution is un-
bounded since sn also has zeros.

it is easy to see that the amplitude of c(x) > m


. therefore the solutions given by (9)
also can not satisfy vacuum-vacuum boundary condition. observe that, for the limit c  1

we obtain from (9) the solution

(x) =

although this solution reaches the vacuum-vacuum boundary conditions (at ) it has a
discontinuity at x = x0 and therefore must be discarded.

this solution may be called cn-type solution.

since above solution is periodic, it is easy to see that c(x) has an innite number of branches
for each value of c. in fig(s) 2 and 3 we show, respectively, the cases c = 1
2 and c = 1. notice
that in the case c = 1 we show just four possibilities for the solutions (15) in the real line.

in general, for each period of the function we get four dierent cases. when we consider all

possibilities for each period an innite number of branches is obtained. nevertheless, for our

purposes only the behaviour of the function inside one period is signicant. so we restrict our
considerations below to the interval (2k(m), 2k(m)), where

k(m) =

for c = 1

2 the kink and anti-kink solutions are recovered (see fig. 2). however, for the
solutions given by g(s). 2.1 and 2.2 the situation is dierent, since they satisfy the condition

vacuum-vacuum, but for the same vacuum. also these solutions have a discontinuity for the

rst derivative at x = 0. this discontinuity in the solutions of this type will appear for any
lenght l. so, these solutions does not belong to the class c 2() we are considering for solving
eq. (1). therefore we discard them as acceptable solutions.

2. the kink and antikink
solutions are recovered in this case. for the rst two functions  is not
continuous at x = 0, so they are not admissible.

from fig(s) 3.3 and 3.4 an interesting case can be studied. if we impose vacuum-vacuum

boundary conditions ( l
2 ) = ( l
for example), the following relation

2 ) = m


for a xed length l we obtain from (15) (for c = 1,

(16)

therefore, this case (fig(s) 3.3 and 3.4) shows that the vacuum-vacuum boundary condition

can be satised on a nite domain in the spirit of casimir eect, but here in the classical level.

for the case in the fig(s) 3.1 and 3.2 the condition vacuum-vacuum is satised for the same
vacuum. moreover, as in the previous case (c = 1
2) these solutions have a discontinuity for the
rst derivative at x = 0. so, also here we discard them as acceptable solutions.

fig. 3. solutions given by eq. (15) for c = 1. here we took x0 = 0. for
a given length l there exists just one solution satisfying vacuum-vacuum
condition at  l
2 .

2. properties of sn-type solutions in an one-dimensional
box

now, we study the bounded sn-type solutions of class c 2() (eq. (12)) that satisfy the

dirichlet boundary conditions.

first of all, it is clear that translation invariance is not valid any more due to dirichlet

boundary conditions on a nite domain, that is, a translated sn in general does not satisfy the
same boundary conditions (in our case dirichlets) in the same interval. only the kink (c = 1
2)
has this property in the innite interval (, +).

now we are going to show that in a given interval [ l

dirichlet boundary conditions at x =  l
solution of eq. (12) satises dirichlet boundary conditions, that is c( l

2 ] there exists only one sn satisfying
2 . the proof is as follows. we note that, in order a
2 ) = 0, we must have

2 , + l

sn


m l

22q1 + 1  2c,

1

1 + 1+12c

c


 = 0.

(17)

(we take, without loss of generality, x0 = 0).

we have from the theory of jacobi elliptic functions

m l

22q1 + 1  2c = 2 kn(m),

where

kn(m) =

k(m)

n

, n = 1, 2, 3 . . . ,

and

m =

1

1 + 1+12c

c

9

(18)

.

here 4 k(m) is a period of the jacobi elliptic functions sn(u, m) 4.
on the other hand, since our solutions are jacobi elliptic functions we must have kn(m) 
2 . this is true only for n = 1. so, there is no solution of the sn-type with semi-period less
than 2k(m).



also we observe from (12) that

lim
c0 | c(x) |= 0

x  .

for xed x  , but large, the convergence of the limit above is very slow.
now, with n = 1, we obtain from (18)

m l =

42

q1 + 1  2c

k(m).

(19)

taking the derivative with respect to parameter c in (19), it is easy to show that d(m l)

dc > 0.
in other words, m l it is an increasing function of the parameter c, and so there exists one

to one correspondence between m l and c (see fig. 4 below). therefore, given an arbitrary l,
there exists only one correspondent c  (0, 1
2) as is shown in fig. 4, and so there exists only
one classical solution l(x) satisfying dirichlet boundary conditions.

taking the limit c  0 we have from (19)

m l = 2.

(20)

this relation shows that there exists a minimal value of m l for the solution (12) satisfying

dirichlet boundary conditions. this is an interesting aspect of these solutions: once it is
placed in a box of size l, its mass must be greater than 2
l . on the other hand if we x m
as the mass of our eld, it can not exist inside a box with size smaller than 2
m . of course if
l  , the minimal mass m  0, and, in this case, all positive mass values are allowed as it
should be in the dhns model.

on the other hand, we can also dene an expression that will be seen as topological charge

for the solution (12). in the literature we nd that the topological charge is dened as 6 :

q =

2 z 



dx j 0,

where

j 0 =

these are the topological charges for an arbitrary length l of the interval.

it is seen

from (17) that with the dirichlet boundary conditions they are equal to zero. for large lengths

11

(l =  or c = 1
that is

2) we recover the usual conserved charge q of the kink (antikink) solutions,

in a similar way we now dene an expression for the total energy (the so called classical

mass in the case of the kink 7), associated to the solution (12), that is

q = 1.

3. properties of cn-type solutions in an one-dimensional
box

in this case for the dierent values of c in (15) there exist dierent values of the topological

charge. as in the last section we must discard the solutions shown in figs. 3.1 and 3.2 since

they have also a discontinuity in the rst derivative.

however, the solutions shown in figs. 3.3 and 3.4 are allowed since for a given l we can

when the condition (16) of vacuum-vacuum transition in a nite domain is satised we

obtain

q = 1.

so, we recover the conserved charge q of the kink (antikink) solutions but now for a nite

domain.

2 we recover once more the energy density of the kink (25).

for c = 1
on the other hand it is not dicult to obtain an expression for the total energy associated
2 we recover the classical

to these solutions using the previous relation in (22). again for c = 1
mass of the kink, i.e., (26).

a similar calculation can be made considering periodic or anti-periodic boundary conditions

for the solution (12). imposing periodic boundary conditions at x =  l

2 , namely

c(

l
2

) = c(

l
2

),

we obtain (both for the positive and negative signs in (12)), the same relation (17) and, there-

fore, all results of the dirichlet case are valid.

the anti-periodic boundary conditions c( l

2 ) are satised automatically for
c  (0, 1
2] and l  (0,) since the solutions (12) are odd functions (we took x0 = 0). so,
this boundary condition does not furnish any constraint like those which we have for a kink.

4. conclusion

in this work we found the general solution of the scalar wave equation for the potential
v () =  1
4 4 in a box in a two dimensional space-time. these solutions are the well
known jacobi elliptic functions. we showed that solutions given by eqs. (6), (9) and (12)

2 m 22 + 

can not satisfy the vacuum-vacuum boundary conditions in a nite domain, but those solution

given by eq. (15) can satisfy these conditions. finally, we showed that there exists one classical

real solution l(x) in an interval with size l satisfying dirichlets boundary conditions. in this
case the product m l has a minimal value 2. this implies that a solution corresponding to
a mass m can not exist in a cavity with length smaller than 2
m . as in the casimir eect these
solutions show that physical properties of some systems can change drastically when placed in
cavities 2.

we have dened expressions for the topological charge (21), total energy (24) and

energy density (23) associated to the elliptic sn-type solutions in a nite domain and shown
2) we recover the conserved charge, classical mass
that for large lengths (l =  or
and energy density of the kink. also, for periodic boundary conditions all results are valid

c = 1

obtained with dirichlet boundary conditions. for anti-periodic boundary conditions it is easy

to see that all solutions of the class dened by eq. (12) are allowed. these solutions, however,
do not satisfy the asymptotic vacuum-vacuum boundary conditions, unless c = 1
2 and l = .
