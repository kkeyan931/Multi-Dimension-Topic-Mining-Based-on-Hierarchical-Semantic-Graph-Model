abstract

it is shown that the poisson bracket with boundary terms recently
proposed by bering (hep-th/9806249) can be deduced from the pois-
son bracket proposed by the present author (hep-th/9305133) if one
omits terms free of euler-lagrange derivatives (annihilation princi-
ple). this corresponds to another denition of the formal product
of distributions (or, saying it in other words, to another denition of
the pairing between 1-forms and 1-vectors in the formal variational
calculus). we extend the formula (initially suggested by bering only
for the ultralocal case with constant coecients) onto the general non-
ultralocal brackets with coecients depending on elds and their spa-
tial derivatives. the lack of invariance under changes of dependent
variables (eld redenitions) seems a drawback of this proposal.

1 introduction

recently bering [1] proposed a formula for the eld theory poisson bracket
with boundary terms which are dierent from those proposed earlier by the
present author [2]. in general the motivation for new brackets arises from the
fact that the well-known standard eld theory poisson bracket is not applica-
ble to many nontrivial boundary problems. in particular it does not satisfy
the jacobi identity. the terms violating the jacobi identity are, of course, of
purely boundary (or divergence) nature and so can be killed by some bound-
ary conditions which are called trivial here. the problem addressed in this
paper as well as in publications [1, 2, 3, 4] consists in searching for the pois-
son bracket formula which exactly fulls the jacobi identity even before any
boundary conditions are taken into account.

according to our knowledge the rst observation of this problem and the
rst successful attempt to solve it was made by lewis, marsden, montgomery
and ratiu (lmmr) in their treatment of dynamics of the ideal uid with a
free boundary [5]. both formulae proposed in [1] and [2] are in fact only two
dierent extrapolations of the same formula suggested in [5]. so, it would be
better to remind rst the pioneering approach.

in contrast to the popular view [6] that in the hamiltonian approach all
functionals should be dierentiable the variations of functionals studied by
lmmr are not free of boundary terms

dqf (q, p)  q =z
dqf (q, p)  p =z

f
q

f
p

 q dv +i
 p dv +i

f

the idea is to generalize the denition of the variational derivative by incor-
porating the boundary contribution

then lmmr in fact proposed to use for the new poisson bracket the old
formula

{f, g} =z (cid:20) f

q(x)

g

p(x)

q(x)

f

p(x)(cid:21)dv

but with new variational derivatives (3), (4) in it

q(x)

{f, g} =z (cid:20) f
+i(cid:20) f
q(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
i(cid:20) g

p(x)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:21)ds.

one immediately sees that the most dangerous term with the product of
-functions is absent above. in fact, to kill this term lmmr put a special
boundary condition

f
q

g
p



g
q

f
p

= 0,

(5)

which enforces zero value for the coecient standing before this dangerous
product.2 unfortunately it is not quite clear whether the poisson bracket
{f, g} preserves this property in general case even if the initial functionals
f and g satisfy (5).

here we see the bifurcation point for the following generalizations of
lmmr result. the idea of [1] is that these dangerous terms with products
of -functions must be omitted independently of any boundary conditions
(annihilation principle). another idea advocated earlier in [2] is to nd a
reasonable formula for these terms.

to explain this in more detail we need rst to introduce a relevant for-
malism for treating general variations of functionals depending on arbitrary
(but nite!) number of spatial derivatives. in [2] the adequate mathematical
machinery was found to be the so-called higher eulerian operators [8, 9, 10].

2it seems interesting to mention that in recent calculations of the central charges arising
in boundary symmetry algebras in chern-simons theory [7] the similar term is cancelled
automatically due to the poisson structure itself.

2

we shall follow notations of [2, 3, 4]. einstein rule is used, i.e. we omit the
sign of summation over repeated indices and multi-indices.

the rst variation of a general local (max|j| < ) functional

f =z

f (a(x), (j)

a (x))dnx

can be written in a form

f =z

f
(j)

a

dj adnx z

f 

a(a)dnx z

dj(cid:0)ej

a(f )a(cid:1) dnx,

(6)

where in general j denotes multi-index j = (j1, ..., jn) and

(j)
a =

|j|a

j1x1 . . . jnxn  dj a,

|j| = j1 + ... + jn.

but in the simplest case of one-dimensional space it is just the order of spa-
tial derivative. we have introduced also the frechet derivative which is a
dierential operator

f 
a =

f
(j)

a

dj.

(7)

the higher eulerian operators ej
mula

a are uniquely dened by the following for-

.

(8)

here binomial coecients for multi-indices are

ej

f
(k)

a

a(f ) =(cid:18)k
k(cid:19) =(cid:18)j1
(cid:18) j

j(cid:19)(d)kj
kn(cid:19),
k1(cid:19)   (cid:18)jn

and

k(cid:19) =(cid:26) j!/(k!(j  k)!)
(cid:18)j

0

if 0  k  j;
otherwise,

(d)k = (1)|k|dk.

both [1] and [2] use the full variation (6) for the construction of the new
poisson brackets but in dierent ways. in [2] it was proposed to start from
the formula

{f, g} = gf z

dj (ej

a(f )ga)dnx z

f 
a(ga)dnx,

3

and to look for ga of such a form which fulls the equation

gf = f g.

the following formula was derived in [2] after some calculations

{f, g} =z

dj+k(cid:16)ej

a(f ) iabek

b (g)(cid:17) dnx z

tr(cid:16)f 

a

iabg

b(cid:17) dnx.

we can for the easier comparison with [1] rst consider only the so-called
ultralocal brackets then

{a(x), b(y)} = iab(x, y),

iab = iba.

in contrast, the proposal of [1] is to start with the already antisymmetric
expression

{f, g} = gf  f g  {f, g}old,

where

{f, g}old =z

e0

a(f )iabe0

b(g)dnx,

gf =z

dj (ej

a(f )ga)dnx z

f 
a(ga)dnx.

then it is possible to use the standard expression for the eld variation

and the resulting formula will be

ga = iabe0

b(g)

{f, g} =z

dj(cid:16)ej

a(f )iabe0

b(g)  ej

a(g)iabe0

b(f )(cid:17)dnx  {f, g}old.

so, it is easy to see that the last formula contains only one summation
over multi-index j whereas formula (2) contains a double sum over j and k.
if we omit all the terms without at least one of e0 operators in this double
sum we immediately get (2).

maybe it will be of some interest to add that in ultralocal case for the
local functionals depending on the spatial derivatives of the elds of order
up to n, berings bracket involves spatial derivatives of order 3n, whereas
the bracket proposed in [2] involves 2n, as also the standard bracket does.
the point of diculty with berings formula seems to be the lack of in-
variance under the changes of dependent variables (dierential substitutions
of elds).

4

2 dierential substitutions

let us consider the invariance properties of the eld theory poisson brackets
under eld redenitions of the type

a   b =  b(a, dj a),

(dierential substitutions).

if we initially have some local poisson brackets for elds a(x), i.e.

{a(x), b(y)} = iab(x)(x, y),

(9)

(10)

where iab = i k
dependent coecients

abdk is a dierential operator of a nite order with eld-

i k
ab = i k

ab(c, dj c),

(11)

then as a result of the dierential substitution (9) we get a result

{  c(x),  d(y)} = ( c)

a (x) ( d)

b (y) iab(x)(x, y).

to transform this expression to the form similar to (10) we need a denition
of the adjoint operator

jab(x)(x, y) = j adjoint

ab

(y)(x, y),

then we will have

( c)

a (x) ( d)

b (y) iab(x)(x, y) = ( c)

(x)(x, y),

the approach which we consider here is dierent from the standard one by
the treatment of boundary (or divergence) terms. all of them should be
preserved in the calculations. this means that we require the exact equality

z

a jabbdnx =z

j 

a

abbdnx,

without discarding any boundary (divergence) terms. in contrast the stan-
dard approach requires only equality up to boundary terms

a jabb  a j 

abb (mod divergences),

5

and

i c d(x) = ( c)

a (x) iab(x)(cid:2)( d)
b(cid:3)adjoint

a (x) iab(x)(cid:2)( d)

b(cid:3)adjoint

(x).

or, in notations of appendix c,

h| j|i = h| j |i.

from the last denition we get a usual relation

j 
ab = (d)k  j k

ba.

but the former one gives a dierent result:

j 

ab = (d)k  j k

ba.

(12)

(13)

here we use the characteristic function of the domain of integration (physical
domain)

(x) =(cid:26) 1

0

if x  ;
otherwise;

to codify the divergences. there is an apparent relation

zrn

(d)kf (x)dnx =zrn

dkf (x)dnx z

dkf (x)dnx.

so, with  we are able to write all the spatial integrals not as integrals over
the physical domain but as integrals over the whole innite coordinate space
rn.

3 the standard bracket

let us rst consider transformations of the standard poisson bracket

{f, g}old =

a(f ) iabe0

b(g)  e0

a(g) iabe0

1

2z (cid:16)e0

b(f )(cid:17) dnx,

under eld redenitions of the type (9). we will use a formula

e0

c(f ) 

e0

a(cid:3)
a(f ) = (cid:2)( c)
 (cid:0)e0

 (1)|k|ek

a( c)  e1

a( c)d + e2
c(f ),

a ( c)dke0

a( c)d2  . . .(cid:1) e0

c(f ) 

6

(14)

(15)

derived in appendix c. then in the integrand of (14) we will have the fol-
lowing expressions

e0

a(f ) iabe0

e0

a(cid:3)
b(g) = (cid:2)( c)
c(f )(cid:2)(cid:2)( c)

b(cid:3)
c(f ) iab(cid:2)( d)
a(cid:3)(cid:3) iab(cid:2)( d)
b(cid:3)

= e0

e0

d(g) =

e0

d(g).

(16)

but, as we discussed above, the two denitions of the adjoint dierential
operator are not equivalent

and so

a   6= ( c)

a ,

= ( c)

a(cid:3)(cid:3)
(cid:2)(cid:2)( c)
a(cid:3)(cid:3) iab(cid:2)( d)
b(cid:3)
(cid:2)(cid:2)( c)

6= i c d.

of course, the dierence has a form of divergences. therefore we see that
the standard eld theory poisson bracket is invariant under eld redenitions
of the form (9) (i.e. dierential substitutions) only up to boundary terms.
surely, this is enough because all the other requirements (jacobi identity,
antisymmetry, leibnitz rule) are also fullled only up to boundary terms
and this bracket does not pretend to be adequate for nontrivial boundary
problems.

4 the general approach to both proposals [1]

and [2]

dealing with local functionals and local poisson brackets in eld theory we
always get a general bracket of two functionals in the following form

{f, g} =z

dnxz

dnyf 

a(x)g

b(y){a(x), b(y)},

where frechet derivatives f 
b(y) are dierential operators (7). if we
represent each integral not as the integral over nite domain but as an integral
over all the innite rn with a characteristic function of the domain 

a(x), g

{f, g} =zrn

(x)dnxzrn

(y)dnyf 

a(x)g

b(y){a(x), b(y)},

7

then it easy to integrate by parts formally and get

{f, g} =zrn

dnxzrn

dny

f

g

a(x)

b(y)

{a(x), b(y)},

where

f

a(x)

= (f 

a(x))  = (d)k 

f
(k)

a !  ej

a(f )(d)j,

with the the analogous formula valid for the variational derivative of g. let
us restrict the consideration to ultralocal case for simplicity, then

{f, g} =zrn

dnxzrn

dny

f

a(x)

iab

g

b(y)

(x, y),

and in both approaches it is believed that

{f, g} =zrn

dnx

f

a(x)

iab

g

b(x)

.

but, of course, this expression includes products of distributions of the form
dj   dk and here these two proposals are dierent:

 in berings approach [1]:

dj   dk = j0dk + k0dj   j0k0,

 in the approach of [2]:

dj   dk = dj+k.

apparently it is possible to avoid these distributions completely as they serve
only to codify divergences. this is demonstrated in publications [4]. then
the key transformation from the double spatial integral to the single spatial
integral with the help of -function can be interpreted simply as a pairing be-
tween 1-forms and 1-vectors of the formal variational calculus [8, 13, 14]. the
pairing dened in [2, 4] is compatible with the grading related to divergences.

8

now if we use the above formula for berings pairing it is possible to derive
the poisson brackets in the most general (not treated in [1]) non-ultralocal
case where iab is a dierential operator of a nite order with eld dependent
coecients. really, this is the same formula with hats added3

{f, g} = f 

1

a(cid:16) iabe0
2(cid:16)e0



a(f ) iabe0

b(g)(cid:17)  g

a(cid:16) iabe0

b(f )(cid:17) 

b(g)  e0

a(g) iabe0

b(f )(cid:17) .

moreover, it is possible to demonstrate that the jacobi identity is fullled
for this bracket for any local operator iab with constant coecients . in the
case of ultralocal poisson brackets with the eld dependent coecients (but
the dependence on eld derivatives is excluded) in appendix b we derive the
following condition of the fullment of the jacobi identity for the bracket
constructed accroding to bering proposal

iab,cicd + ida,cicb + ibd,cica = 0.

in appendix b we also give the condition for the most general case of non-
ultralocal brackets with coecients depending on the spatial derivatives of
elds also.

5 dierential substitutions and berings pro-

posal [1]

now let us consider the formula derived in the previous section as a further
development of the initial proposal by bering [1]

{f, g}b =z

f 
a

iabe0

b(g)dnx z

g
a

iabe0

b(f )dnx  {f, g}old,

(17)

where {f, g}old is the standard poisson bracket treated before.

3it is possible to derive a more general formula if we do not suggest that the opera-
tor iab should be antisymmetric with respect to the standard denition of the adjoint.
but this formula does not full the jacobi identity even for non-ultralocal brackets with
constant coecients.

9

the frechet derivative transforms under dierential substitutions (9) as

follows (see appendix c)

a = f 
f 

c ( c)

a ,

so we obtain

f 
a

iabe0

b = f 

c ( c)

a

e0

d(g).

b(cid:3)
iab(cid:2)( d)
b(cid:3)
iab(cid:2)( d)

,

it means that the rst and second terms of the bracket will be invariant if
we suppose

i c d = ( c)

a

so, the old denition of the adjoint operator (12) should be used here in
accordance with the treatment given by bering (see subsection (5.5) of [1]).
unfortunately, this bracket contains also a term {f, g}old (the standard
poisson bracket) with another transformation properties. as we have demon-
strated in section 3 this term is invariant under eld redenitions only up to
divergences. so, taken as a whole, berings formula is not invariant.

6 dierential substitutions and the bracket

proposed in [2]

let us show that in contrast the formula

{f, g} =z

tr(cid:16)f 

a

iabg

b(cid:17) dnx

is precisely invariant under eld redenitions of the form (9). we remind that
the trace is used here to denote the rules of composition of the dierential
operators f 

a, iab and g
b:

a

f 
a =

f
(j)
iab = i k
abdk,
g
(j)

g
b =

b

dj ,

dj .

operator f 
operator g

a acts on everything to the right of it, so does operator iab, and
b acts on everything to the left of it, i.e. acts on everything besides

10

its own coecients,

tr(cid:16)f 

a

iabg

b(cid:17) (cid:18)j

l(cid:19)(cid:18)k

m(cid:19)dm

f
(j)

a

dj+klm iabdl

(k)

b

.

after the eld redenition we get

{f, g} =z

c( c)

a

tr(cid:16)f 

iabg

d( d)

b(cid:17) dnx.

so, if we use here the adjoint operator to ( d)
act only onto g
d

b dened by (13) then it will

{f, g} =z

c( c)

a

tr(cid:16)f 

iab [( d)

b] g

d(cid:17) dnx.

but according to our denitions given in section 2

i c d = ( c)

a

iab [( d)

b] .

as a result we see that this denition of the eld theory poisson bracket with
boundary terms is exactly invariant under dierential substitutions.

in publication [11] this invariance was demonstrated for the concrete ex-

ample  the ashtekar transformation [12] of the gravitational variables.

7 conclusion

we considered above an interesting proposal made by bering on the boundary
terms in the eld theory poisson bracket. we generalize this proposal to the
most general local poisson brackets and nd the conditions necessary to
full the jacobi identity. according to our treatment given in more detail in
previous publications [2, 4] there are three separate ingredients of the poisson
bracket construction which should be revised: the dierential of the local
functional, the poisson bivector and the pairing operation. bering uses the
same denition for the dierential, but changes the pairing and the bivector.
it occurs so that to change the pairing alone means to get into trouble with
the jacobi identity in the non-ultralocal case.

really, the paper [1] suggest a lot of new ideas which deserve more dis-
cussion. here we only concentrated on the drawback that it seemingly had.

11

probably, the further investigation will show whether these drawback could
be overcome in berings approach. but anyhow it is absent if we use another
formula suggested in [2].

+cyclic permutation of (f, g, h).

from the above expression it is apparent that in the case of constant coe-
cients i m
ab the jacobi identity is satised. it is straightforward to check that
in the case of ultralocal poisson brackets with the coecients depending on
the elds (but not on their spatial derivatives) we get a well-known condition
for the fullment of the jacobi identity

iab,cicd + cyclic permutation of (a, b, d) = 0.

appendix c. the transformation rules

here we derive the transformation rules for euler-lagrange and frechet
derivatives under dierential substitutions of elds (9).

first, let us consider the variation of an arbitrary function of the elds

f = f 

aa 

f
(j)

a

dj a.

15

if we use the transformed elds

then we get

where

therefore,

 b =  b(a, dja),

f = f 

b  b 

f
 (k)

b

dk  b,

  b = ( b)

aa.

f 
a = f 

b  ( b)
a.

second, let us consider an expression

h1|f 

a|ai = ha|(f 

a)|1i  e0

a(f )a,

where the angle brackets denote the standard integrand, dened up to diver-
gences, and make a change of variables

a   b =  b(a, dja),

then

or,

e0

a(f )a = h1|f 

b  ( b)

= h( b)

aa|(f 

a|a|i = h1|f 
b(f )( b)

b|( b)
aa =

b)|1i = e0

aai =

b(f )|( b)

a|ai = ha| (( b)

a) |e0

b(f )i,

e0

a(f ) = (( b)

a) e0

b(f ).

this result can be checked by more tedious but straightforward calculation
by using formulae for eulerian operators given in article [10].
