we review the calculation of the spectrum of glueball masses in non-supersymmetric yang-mills
theory using the conjectured duality between supergravity and large n gauge theories. the glueball
masses are obtained by solving the supergravity wave equations in a black hole geometry. the
glueball masses found this way are in unexpected agreement with the available lattice data. we also
show how to use a modied version of the duality based on rotating branes to calculate the glueball
mass spectrum with some of the kaluza-klein states of the supergravity theory decoupled from the
spectrum.

i. introduction

maldacenas conjecture [1] relates n = 4 supersymmetric su (n ) gauge theories in the large n limit to type iib
string theory on an ads5  s5 background, where ads5 is a ve dimensional anti-de sitter space. the metric of this
space is given by

where ls is the string length related to the superstring tension, gs is the string coupling constant and d5 is the line
element on s5. the x1,2,3,4 directions in ads5 correspond to r4 where the gauge theory lives. the gauge coupling
constant g4 of the 4d theory is related to the string coupling constant gs by g2
4 = gs. in the t hooft limit (n  
with g2
4n = gsn xed), the string coupling constant vanishes gs  0. therefore we can study the 4d theory using the
rst quantized string theory in the ads space (1). moreover if gsn  1, the curvature of the ads space is small and
the string theory is approximated by classical supergravity. witten extended this proposal to non-supersymmetric
theories [2]. in his setup supersymmetry is broken by heating up the n = 4 theory, which corresponds to putting the
four dimensional theory on a circle and assigning anti-periodic boundary conditions to the fermions. in this case the
fermions will get a supersymmetry breaking mass term of the order t = 1/2r, where r is the radius of the compact
coordinate and t is the corresponding temperature, while the scalars (not protected by supersymmetry anymore) will
get masses from loop corrections. thus in the t   limit this should reproduce a pure (3 dimensional) su (n )
theory in the large n limit, which we will refer to as qcd3. on the string theory side this corresponds to replacing
the anti-de sitter metric by a schwarzschild metric describing a black hole in the anti-de sitter space. this metric is
given by

the supergravity approximation is valid for this theory when the curvature of the space is small, thus when gsn  .
however, in order to obtain the pure gauge theory we have to take the temperature to innity. in order to keep the
intrinsic scale g2
4n/r of the resulting theory at the scale of qcd, we simultaneously would need to take
g2
4n = gsn  0. here g3 is the dimensionful gauge coupling of qcd3. this is exactly the opposite limit in which the
supergravity approximation is applicable! thus as expected for any strong-weak duality, the weakly coupled classical
supergravity theory and the qcd3 theory are valid in dierent limits of the t hooft coupling g2

3n = g2

4n .

from the point of view of qcd3, the radius r of the compactifying circle provides the ultraviolet cuto scale.
therefore, with the currently available techniques, the maldacena-witten conjecture can only be used to study large
n qcd with a xed ultraviolet cuto r1 in the strong ultraviolet coupling regime, and hope that the results one
obtains this way are not very sensitive to removing the cuto, that is on going from one limit to the other. since the
theory is non-supersymmetric, there is a priori no reason to believe that these two limits have anything to do with
each other, since for example there might very well be a phase transition when the t hooft coupling is decreased from
the very large values where the supergravity description is valid to the small values where the theory should describe
qcd3. nevertheless, witten showed that the supergravity theory correctly reproduces several of the qualitative
features of a conning 3 dimensional pure gauge theory correctly [2]. in particular, he showed that there is an area
law in the wilson loop and that there is a mass gap in the spectrum, both of which are expected features of a conning
gauge theory. here we will address the question of whether any of the quantitative features of the gauge theories are
reproduced as well. in particular, we will calculate the glueball mass spectrum of the theory, and nd, that it is in
reasonable agreement with recent lattice simulations [3].

ii. the glueball spectrum in 3 dimensions

f bf c

in this section we will show how to calculate the glueball spectrum of some of the glueballs in the supergravity
in the following we will use the notation j p c for the glueballs, where
approximation in the 3 dimensional case.
j is the glueball spin, and p , c refer to the parity and charge conjugation quantum numbers respectively. in the
eld theory, one can nd operators that have the quantum numbers corresponding to the given glueball states. for
example, an operator with quantum numbers 0++ is given by o4 = trf 2, or an operator with quantum numbers
0 is given by o6 = dabcf a
 . according to the renement of the maldacena conjecture given in [4], one
should nd a supergravity state corresponding to the chiral primary operators of the original n = 4 conformal theory,
which will couple to the supergravity states on the boundary of the ads space. assuming this coupling is maintained
while heating the system, we can nd the supergravity operators coupling to o4 and o6. the dilaton and the r-r
scalar of the supergravity theory combine into a complex massless scalar eld. its real and imaginary parts couple
to the dimension 4 scalar operators o4 = tr f 2 and o4 = tr f  f . the ns-ns and r-r two-forms combine into a
complex-valued antisymmetric eld a , polarized along the r4. its (ads mass)2 = 16 and thus one can show that
it couples to a dimension 6 two-form operator of the n = 4 theory. this operator has been identied as the operator
o6 [5,6]. with this knowledge we would like to calculate the actual glueball mass spectrum corresponding to these
operators o4 and o6. in eld theory, in order to calculate the masses of these states one would need to evaluate the
correlators ho4(x)o4(y)i = pi ciemi|xy|, where the mis are the glueball masses. according to the renement of

the maldacena conjecture [4], this just amounts to solving the supergravity wave equations for the elds that couple
to these operators on the boundary. in the case of the 0++ glueballs, we need to nd the solutions of the dilaton
equations of motion of the form  = f ()eikx. this is because in the supergravity theory on ads5  s5, the kaluza-
klein modes on the s5 can be classied according to the spherical harmonics of the s5, which form representations of
the isometry group so(6) (which is the r-symmetry group of the n = 4 theory). when we put the theory at nite
temperature, the states carrying non-trivial so(6) quantum numbers should eventually decouple from the spectrum,
thus the glueballs should be identied with the so(6) singlet states, which implies a solution of the form  = f ()eikx

2

for the dilaton as mentioned above. thus we will look for normalizable regular solutions to the dilaton equation of
motion which will give a discrete spectrum with the glueball masses determined as k2

in the supergravity description we have to solve the classical equation of motion of the massless dilaton,

i = m 2
i .

 [gg] = 0 ,

(4)

on the ads5 black hole background (2). plugging the ansatz  = f ()eikx into this equation and using the metric of
(2) one obtains the following dierential equation for f :

1 d

d (cid:18)(cid:0)4  b4(cid:1) 

df

d(cid:19)  k2f = 0

(5)

since the glueball mass m 2 is equal to k2, the task is to solve this equation as an eigenvalue problem for k2. in
the following we set b = 1, so the masses are computed in units of b. we need to nd normalizable solutions to this
equations which are also regular at the horizon. for large , the black hole metric (2) asymptotically approaches the
ads metric, and the behavior of the solution for a p-form for large  takes the form , where  is determined from
the mass m of the supergravity eld:

indeed both (5) and (6) give the asymptotic forms f  1, 4, and only the later is a normalizable solution [2].
changing variables to f = /4 we have:

m2 = ( + 4  2p) .

(6)

for large  this equation can be solved by series solution with negative even powers:

(cid:0)2  6(cid:1)  +(cid:0)3 5  7(cid:1)  +(cid:0)16 + k22(cid:1)  = 0

 = 

n=0a2n2n

since the normalization is arbitrary we can set a0 = 1. the rst few coecients are given by:

for n  5 the coecients are given by the recursive relation:

(n2 + 4n)an = k2an2 + n2an4 .

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

since the black hole geometry is regular at the horizon  = 1, k2 has to be adjusted so that f is also regular at  = 1
[2]. this can be done numerically in a simple fashion using a shooting technique as follows. for a given value of
k2 the equation is numerically integrated from some suciently large value of  (  k2) by matching f () with the
asymptotic solution set by (8) and (9). the glueball mass m is related to the eigenvalues of k2 by m 2 = k2 in units
of b2. the results obtained this way, together with the results of the lattice simulations [7] are displayed in table i.
since the lattice results are in units of string tension, we normalize the supergravity results so that the lightest 0++
state agrees with the lattice result. one should also expect a systematic error in addition to the statistical error
denoted in table i for the lattice computations. similar numerical results have been obtained in [8], while a wkb
approximation for the eigenvalues of (5) has been obtained in [9].

the 0 glueballs can be dealt with similarly by considering the two-form of the supergravity theory, which couples

to the operator o6. the supergravity equation of motion for the s-wave component of this eld is given by

table ii. since the supergravity method and the lattice gauge theory compute the glueball masses in dierent units,
one cannot compare the absolute values of the lowest glueball mass obtained using these methods. however it makes
sense to compare the lowest glueball masses of dierent quantum numbers. using tables i and ii, we nd that the
supergravity results are in good agreement with the lattice gauge theory computation [7]:

one can see, that the glueball mass ratios obtained from the supergravity calculation are in reasonable agreement
with the lattice results, even though as explained in the introduction these two calculations are in the opposite limits
for the t hooft coupling. therefore, it is important to see, how the ratios are modied once corrections due to string
theory are taken into account. the leading string theory corrections can be calculated by using the results of [10],
who calculated the rst  corrections to the ads black-hole metric (2). the details of the calculation can be found
in [3], here we just give the results for the 0++ state:

hope that these corrections to the ratios of the glueball masses are small. however, it can be seen that this is probably

4n  0 limit from the spectrum. however, in the supergravity limit of nite r, g2

a too optimistic assumption, by considering the kaluza-klein partners of the glueball states. as explained above,
the glueball states do not carry quantum numbers under the so(6) isometry, and are also singlets under the u (1)
symmetry corresponding to the compact direction  . the kaluza-klein modes however do carry quantum numbers
under so(6)  u (1), and they do not correspond to any state in the qcd theory, but rather they should decouple in
the r  0, g2
4n   these states
have masses comparable to the light glueballs [11]. this is simply a consequence of the fact, that the masses of the
fermions and scalars carrying the so(6)  u (1) quantum numbers is of the order of the temperature t , thus their
bound states are expected to also have masses of the order of the temperature. however, since the temperature is
the only scale in the theory, and so this will also be the cuto scale of the qcd theory, and thus the mass scale for
the glueballs. in particular, the masses of the kk modes of the 0++ glueballs obtained from the dilaton equation by
using the ansatz  = f ()eikxyl(5) are given by [11]

where we have displayed the unnormalized values of the masses of the dierent kk modes.

one can explicitly see, that the masses of these kk modes are as expected of the same order as the masses of the
glueball states. one might hope that even though the supergravity approximation of these masses is of the same order
as for the glueballs, string theory corrections will increase the masses of these states compared to the glueball states.
unfortunately, at least the leading string theory corrections calculated in [11,3] do not support this conclusion. the
corrections to the rst few kk modes are

thus one can see that the masses of these kk modes in fact do need large  corrections to remove them from the
spectrum of states. then it is not clear why one would get large corrections to the masses of the kk modes but not
to the masses of the glueball states. this situation is clearly unsatisfactory, therefore one may try to improve on it
by introducing a dierent supergravity background, where some of these kk modes are automatically decoupled. we
will consider this possibility in the next section where we discuss the construction based on rotating branes [1214].

iii. the glueball spectrum in 4 dimensions and the construction based on

rotating branes

results similar to the the ones presented in the previous section can be obtained for the glueball mass spectrum
in qcd4 by starting from a slightly dierent construction where the m-theory 5-brane is wrapped on two circles [2].
the details of these results can be found in [3,15]. here we will review only the generalized construction based on the
rotating m5 brane with one angular momentum, rst constructed in [12], and explored in [13]. the metric for this
background is given by

note, that in the limit when a/u0  1, the radius of compactication r shrinks to zero, thus the kk modes on this
compact direction are expected to decouple in this theory when we increase the angular momentum a. in order to
nd the mass spectrum of the 0++ glueballs, we need to again solve the dilaton equations of motion as a function of
a. this can be done by plugging the background (16) into the dilaton equation of motion

for a dilaton ansatz of the form  = f (u)eikx we obtain the dierential equation

which can be solved the same way as explained in the previous section, where the eigenvalues are now a function of
the angular momentum parameter a. the results of this are summarized in table iii. note, that while some of the
kk modes decouple in the a   limit, the 0++ glueball mass ratios change only very slightly, showing that the
supergravity predictions are robust for these ratios against the change of the angular momentum parameter.

for the excited state the supergravity calculation came before the lattice results.

one can similarly calculate the mass ratios for the 0+ glueballs, by considering the equations of motion of the rr
1-form in the background (16), since on the d4 brane worldvolume this couples to the operator trf f . to nd the
glueball spectrum we have to solve the supergravity equation of motion of the rr 1-form

in the background (16). using the ansatz a2 = f (u)eikx leads to the dierential equation

 [ggg(a  a)] = 0

(u6  a4u2  u6

which we solve using the same numerical methods as in the previous section. the results are summarized in table
iv. note, that the change in the 0+ glueball mass is sizeable when going from a = 0 to a  , and is in the right
direction as suggested by lattice results [16,17].

one can also calculate the masses of the dierent kaluza-klein modes in the background of (16). one nds, that
as expected from the fact that for a   the compact circle shrinks to zero, the kk modes on this compact circle
decouple from the spectrum, leading to a 4 dimensional eld theory in this limit. however, the kk modes of the sphere
s4 do not decouple from the spectrum even in the a   limit. these conclusions remain unchanged even in the case
when one considers the theory with the maximal number of angular momenta (which is two for the case of qcd4)
[14,18]. in the limit when the angular momentum becomes large, a/u0  1, the theory approaches a supersymmetric
limit [12,14] since the supersymmetry breaking fermion masses get smaller with increasing angular momentum [19].
therefore, the limit of increasing angular momentum on one hand does decouple some of the kk modes which makes
the theory four dimensional, but at the same time reintroduces the light fermions into the spectrum [19].

iv. conclusions

we have seen how the witten extension of maldacenas conjecture can be used to study pure yang-mills theories
in the large n limit. these theories reproduce several of the qualitative features of qcd, and one can also study the
predictions for the glueball mass spectra. one nds, that the supergravity calculations are in a reasonable agreement
with the lattice results, even though they are obtained in the opposite limit of the t hooft coupling. it would be very
important to understand, whether this unexpected agreement is purely a numerical coincidence or whether there is
any deeper reason behind it.
