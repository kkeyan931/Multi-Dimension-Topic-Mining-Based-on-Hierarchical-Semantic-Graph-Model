1 introduction

recently, randall and sundrum [1] proposed a new interesting mechanism with a single
small extra dimension for solving the hierarchy problem between the planck scale and the

weak scale. a key ingredient of the mechanism is that the metric is not factorizable and
that the four-dimensional metric is multiplied by a warp factor which is a rapidly changing
function of the extra dimension. they explicitly constructed such a solution to einsteins
equations in ve spacetime dimensions, one of which is compactied on s1/z2, with two
3-branes located at the xed points of s1/z2. for a solution to exist, it is crucial to take
into account the eect of the branes on the bulk gravitational metric.

in the randall-sundrum model, the number of 3-branes is two and the locations are taken
to be the xed points of s1/z2. although this setup is motivated by recent developments in
string and m-theory [2], it would be of interest to construct new solutions to ve-dimensional

einsteins equations with many 3-branes. in this letter, we shall explicitly construct solutions
with an arbitrary number of 3-branes which are put at arbitrary positions in the direction of
the extra dimension. our motivation for this is threefold. first, it is known that any number

of parallel d-branes can be put at arbitrary positions and that gauge dynamics depends on
the distances of multiple d-branes[3]. thus, it will physically be meaningful to construct

solutions corresponding to many 3-branes put at arbitrary positions. second, many-brane
congurations could explain other hierarchy problems such as the fermion mass hierarchy.

the original randall-sundrum model gives a solution to the hierarchy problem between the
planck scale and the weak scale, but does not answer other hierarchy problems. in recent
works on large extra dimensions [4], various mechanisms to solve hierarchy problems have

been proposed. some of the authors have pointed out that multiple 3-branes could explain
the fermion mass hierarchy[5].
in this scenario, the mass hierarchy crucially depends on

the distances between 3-branes. thus, again, it is interesting to consider multiple 3-brane
congurations with various distances between 3-branes. third, in any higher-dimensional

models, stabilizing extra dimensions is, in general, hard to achieve. in ref.[6] a mechanism
for stabilizing extra dimensions by multiple branes has been proposed.

the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we construct static solutions to ein-
steins equations in ve spacetime dimensions with any number of 3-branes put at arbitrary
positions. in section 3, we discuss the hierarchical structure of our model. in section 4, we

extend the static solutions found in section 2 to inationary solutions. section 5 is devoted
to conclusions.

2 many-brane congurations

in the randall-sundrum model, the orbifold xed points of s1/z2 have been taken as the
locations of two 3-branes. since we would like to consider any number of 3-branes whose
locations are taken to be arbitrary, we here take a circle s1, rather than s1/z2, as the
compactication of an extra dimension. 5 the coordinate  for the extra dimension is taken
to be from 0 to 2 with the identication of (x,  = 0) with (x,  = 2).

let us consider parallel n 3-brane congurations in 5 spacetime dimensions. the i-th
3-brane may be characterized by the location i and the brane tension vi (i = 1, 2,   , n).
we arrange the locations of the 3-branes such that 0 = 1 < 2 <    < n < 2. we
have here taken the location 1 of the rst 3-brane to be the origin of s1 for convenience.
since the 5-dimensional spacetime is divided into n domains by n 3-branes, each domain
sandwiched between the i-th and the (i + 1)-th 3-branes can have a dierent 5-dimensional
cosmological constant i. 6 thus, the action we start with is given by 7

in this section, we solve the equations under the following metric ansatz:

as taken in ref.[1]. in the later section, we shall try to nd solutions describing inating
3-branes in 5 spacetime dimensions.

5solutions for s 1/z2 may be obtained from those for s 1 by imposing the z2-symmetry.
6solutions to the einsteins equations with even numbers of 3-branes have been constructed in ref.[7],
in which i have been taken to be identical for all i. similar solutions to ours, which describe multiple
intersecting branes, have been found in ref.[8]

it is not dicult to show that the solution to the above equations has the following form:

() = (1  0)(  1)(  1)

+(2  1)(  2)(  2)
+    + (n  n 1)(  n )(  n ),

(6)

where the additive integration constant, which is not physically relevant, has appropriately
been chosen for later convenience. since () is a function on s1, it has to be periodic, i.e.
(2) = (0). this leads to a constraint

i = sir2

(i = 1, 2,   , n).

(8)

we note that every i should be negative for the solution to make sence, as pointed out
in ref.[1]. this requirement can, however, be relaxed for inating solutions, as we will see
later. the second equation (5) requires that the 5-dimensional cosmological constants and
the brane tensions should be related as follows:

virc
12m 3 = i  i1,

(i = 1, 2,   , n)

(9)

with 0  n . 8

although we have given the exact analytical expression for (), it may be instructive

to gure out it in a geometrical way. the solution (6) turns out to be depicted as follows:
first, specify distinct n points i which correspond to the locations of n 3-branes and
choose the values of (i) at  = i appropriately. the whole -dependence of () can
then be obtained by connecting two adjacent points (i) and (i+1) for i = 1, 2,   , n
by straight lines.
in general, each line will be bent at  = i. the slope of the line in
the region of i   < i+1 corresponds to i, which is related to i through eq.(8). the
dierence between the slopes of the adjacent lines at  = i is proportional to the brane

8to obtain the relation for i = 1, we need to use the periodicity of ().

tension vi. although the solution () can completely be specied by 2n parameters i
and (i) (i = 1, 2,   , n), two of them are not physically relevant. an additive constant
to () can be absorbed into an overall constant rescaling of x and an overall shift of i
gives no physical consequences.

3 hierarchical structure

in this section, we shall discuss the hierarchical structure of our solution derived in the
previous section. to this end, the mass scale of all the parameters (i, vi, m and rc) in the
fundamental theory is assumed to be of order the planck scale.

as mentioned in the previous section, () is specied by i and (i). without loss of
generality, we can assume that (i)  (1) = 0. as was done in ref.[1], we can derive the
four-dimensional eective theory by performing the  integral. it turns out that the square
of the planck mass on every 3-brane takes a common value, i.e.

m 2

p l = m 3rcz 2

d e2()

21

2n(cid:19) +

xi=2  1

(10)

this relation is consistent with the assumption that m and rc are of order the planck scale
if i are of order 1 and (i)  1 for i = 2, 3,   , n.

now, the hierarchical structure of our model is obvious. although the 4-dimensional
(eective) newton constant is observed to be order m 2
p l for every brane, physical mass scales
for the i-th brane will reduce by the warp factor e(i) from the fundamental parameters
not far from the planck scale. the randall-sundrum scenario works well in our model but
we can obtain a variety of the hierarchy between the planck scale and physical mass scales,
which is not seen in the original randall-sundrum solution. thus, in our model the hierarchy

problem may be explained as follows: the reason why the hierarchy between the tev scale
and the planck scale is observed in our world is merely the fact that it happened that we
live on a 3-brane whose warp factor is of order 1015.

4 inating 3-branes

in this section, we shall obtain solutions describing inating 3-branes in 5 spacetime dimen-
sions. to this end, we take the following metric ansatz [9,10]:

ds2 = a()2(dt2 + v(t)2ijdxidxj) + r2

c d2.

where primes and dots denote derivatives with respect to  and t, respectively. the rst

equation (12) can easily be solved as

v(t) = v(0)eht,

(15)

where h corresponds to the expansion rate along a 3-brane after the coecient of dt2 is
normalized to unity on the 3-brane.

although we have not found a simple expression for a(), like eq. (6), solutions to the

above equations turn out to be of the form

a() = iei + iei

for i   < i+1.

(16)

requiring that a() is continuous at  = i (i = 1, 2,   , n) leads to 9

n e2n + n e2n = 1 + 1,

i1ei1i + i1ei1i = ieii + ieii,

(i = 2, 3,   , n).

(17)

substituting the expressions (15) and (16) into eq. (13) leads to

(i)2 = 
h 2 =

(i = 1, 2,   , n),
(i = 1, 2,   , n).

(18)

(19)

it may be worth noting that the rst relation (18) does not necessarily mean that i should
be negative. solutions may exist even when i > 0. in this case, i is purely imaginary
and the exponential functions in eq. (16) should be replaced by trigonometric functions.
furthermore, even if h 2 is negative, we would obtain physically meaningful solutions by
analytic continuation [10]. the last equation (14) can be satised provided

(i = 1, 2,   , n),

(20)

where 0  n , 0  n and 0  n .

the above solutions for n = 1 and 2 (one and two 3-branes) have been investigated in
refs. [9,10]. it, however, seems dicult to analyze the solutions for general n thoroughly.

we will not proceed further in this letter. some of physical implications of our solutions
may be found in refs. [9,10].

5 conclusions

in this letter, we have found the new solutions to the einsteins equations in 5 spacetime

dimensions with many 3-branes. the original randall-sundrum solution contains only two
3-branes whose locations are xed at the orbifold xed points of s1/z2, and is static. in
our model, any number of parallel 3-branes can be put at arbitrary locations in the direc-
tion of the 5th dimension, and the brane tensions and the cosmological constants of the
5-dimensional bulks sandwiched between the 3-branes can, in general, be taken to be dier-

ent values, though they have to satisfy some ne tuning relations for solutions to exist. we
have further succeeded to extend the static solutions to the inationary ones, though our

analysis has been far from complete.

as in the randall-sundrum model, our model can give a solution to the hierarchy problem

between the planck scale and the tev scale. although the randall-sundrum model does
not answer other hierarchy problems such as the fermion mass hierarchy, the existence of
multiple 3-branes in our model could give a possible mechanism to solve them.

a nal comment is that although the 5th dimension is compactied on s1, our solutions
will persist on a non-compact space. this can be done by simply ignoring the periodicity

condition.
