abstract

we show that the single-mode parafermionic type systems possess supersymmetry,
which is based on the symmetry of characteristic functions of the parafermions related
to the generalized deformed oscillator of daskaloyannis et al. the supersymmetry is re-
alized in both unbroken and spontaneously broken phases. as in the case of parabosonic
supersymmetry observed recently by one of the authors, the form of the associated su-
peralgebra depends on the order of the parafermion and can be linear or nonlinear
in the hamiltonian. the list of supersymmetric parafermionic systems includes usual
parafermions, nite-dimensional q-deformed oscillator, q-deformed parafermionic oscil-
lator and parafermionic oscillator with internal z2 structure.

1 introduction

recently, it has been established that the concepts of generalized statistics [1, 2] and su-
persymmetry [3, 4, 5], which can be unied in the form of parasupersymmetry [6], turn out
to be intimately related. this has been done by observation of hidden supersymmetry in
pure parabosonic systems with quadratic hamiltonians [7]. this hidden parabosonic super-
symmetry generally has a structure of the reduced parasupersymmetry. on the other hand,
parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics [6, 5] is formulated in the simplest case in terms
of one bosonic and one parafermionic degrees of freedom. therefore, the following natu-
ral questions appear: is it possible to realize supersymmetry in pure parafermionic systems
and if so, what is its general properties in comparison with parabosonic supersymmetry [7]?
answering these questions constitutes the subject of the present paper.

supersymmetric quantum mechanics [4, 5] being a (0 + 1)-dimensional model of super-
symmetric quantum eld theories is formulated in the case of n = 1 supersymmetry in
terms of one bosonic and one fermionic degrees of freedom.
in the bosonized version of
supersymmetric quantum mechanics [8, 9], n = 1 supersymmetry is realized by means
of only one bosonic degree of freedom. however, the price which is necessary to pay for
such minimal realization of supersymmetry is the essentially nonlinear (nonlocal) structure
of the hamiltonian and supercharges. alternative realization of n = 1 supersymmetry is
given by the parabosonic hamiltonians of the simplest normal ordered, hn = a+a, or anti-
normal ordered, ha = aa+, form [7].
in both cases the hamiltonians are quadratic in
parabosonic operators, but the associated supercharges have essentially nonlinear structure
in a. the anticommutator of such supercharges is given by the polynomial of the hamilto-
nian, {q, q} = h(h), whose degree is correlated with the order p of parastatistics dened
by the relation aa+|0i = p|0i. in the simplest case corresponding to p = 2, the usual linear
superalgebra with {q, q} = h is associated with the single-mode parabosonic system being
in the phase of exact (hn) or spontaneously broken (ha) supersymmetry. for revealing the
described parabosonic supersymmetries, the r-deformed heisenberg algebra [10]

[a, a+] = 1 + r,

{r, a} = 0, r2 = 1,

(1.1)

has been used, which at the non-negative integer values of the deformation parameter,  =
p 1, p = 1, 2, . . . , is directly related to a paraboson of the order p [1]. but it was established
[10] that at the special negative values of the deformation parameter given by the sequence
 = (2k+1), k = 1, 2, . . ., some parafermionic algebra with internal z2 structure is naturally
associated with the algebra (1.1). therefore, this paraboson-parafermion universality of the
algebra (1.1) indicates on the possibility of realizing supersymmetry in the single-mode nite-
dimensional parafermionic type systems.

in section 2 we consider nite-dimensional representations of the generalized deformed
oscillator of daskaloyannis et al [11, 12] which includes algebra (1.1) as a particular case
[7], and show that the systems described by the simplest hamiltonians hn = f f and
ha = f f  possess the unbroken supersymmetry, whereas the hamiltonian hs = f f + f f 
describes supersymmetric systems in the phase of spontaneously broken supersymmetry.
here the analysis is given in general form not depending on the concrete structure of the
parafermionic type oscillator, and it is shown that in the cases of broken and unbroken
supersymmetries the form of the associated superalgebra depends on the parity of the order

2

p of the (generalized) parafermion. in section 3 we consider particular examples of nite-
dimensional supersymmetric systems related to various deformation schemes of the single-
mode oscillator algebra. this includes the usual parafermions [1], the generalized deformed
parafermions with internal z2 structure [10], the nite-dimensional q-deformed oscillator
[13, 14, 15] and the q-deformed parafermions [16, 17]. we nd also that the appropriate linear
combination of the hamiltonians hn and ha in the case of usual parafermions gives rise to
nonlinear supersymmetries characterized, like in the case of parabosons, by the presence of
arbitrary (xed) number of singlet states. section 4 summarizes the results.

2 supersymmetry of generalized deformed oscillator

2.1 generalized deformed oscillator

the generalized deformed oscillator [11] is dened by the algebra generated by the operators
{1, f, f , n} satisfying the relations

[n, f ] = f,

[n, f ] = f ,

f f = f (n),

f f  = f (n + 1),

(2.1)

where n is the number operator and the structure function f (x) is an analytic function with
the properties f (0) = 0 and f (n) > 0, n = 1, . . .. as a consequence, the operators f , f 
obey the commutation and anticommutation relations

{f , f } = f (n + 1) + f (n),

[f, f ] = f (n + 1)  f (n).

(2.2)

the structure function f (x) is characteristic to the deformation scheme.

the generalized deformed oscillator algebra can naturally be represented on the fock
hn|mi = nm, n = 0, 1, . . . , if

space of eigenstates of the number operator n, n|ni = n|ni,
the vacuum state is dened as f |0i = 0. such eigenstates are given by

|ni =

1

qf (n)!

(f )n|0i, f (n)! 

n

y

k=1

f (k).

the operators f and f  are the annihilation and creation operators of this oscillator algebra,

f |ni = qf (n)|n  1i,

f |ni = qf (n + 1)|n + 1i.

when the characteristic function obeys the condition

f (p + 1) = 0,

(2.3)

(2.4)

the creation-annihilation operators satisfy the relations f p+1 = (f )p+1 = 0. this means that
the corresponding representation is (p + 1)-dimensional and we have a parafermionic type
system of the order p. it is this case that will be treated in what follows.

tonian hn = f f for the cases of a) odd p (p = 5) and b) even p (p = 6).

2.2 unbroken supersymmetry

let us suppose that the structure function satises also the property

f (n) = f (p + 1  n).

(2.5)

then the parafermionic-like systems given by the quadratic hamiltonians hn = f f and
ha = f f  possess the degenerated spectra, whose typical form is shown on fig. 1.

the parafermions [1], the generalized deformed parafermions with internal z2 structure
[10], the nite-dimensional q-deformed oscillator [13, 14, 15] and the q-deformed parafermions
[16, 17] are given by the characteristic functions having the property (2.5). the form of
the degenerated spectra indicates that these systems may possess the supersymmetry of
two types. the supersymmetry corresponding to the case of even p is characterized by the
presence of one singlet state (|0i for hn and |pi for ha), whereas the case of odd p is specied
by the presence of two singlet states (|0i and |(p + 1)/2i for hn, and |pi and |(p  1)/2i for
ha). therefore, one can expect that dierent superalgebras can be associated with such
systems in the cases of the even and of the odd order generalized parafermions.

let us nd the corresponding supercharge operators and the form of superalgebras which
they form with the hamiltonian. we start with the case of even p. in the system given
by the hamiltonian hn = f f , there are p/2 pairs of the states {|ni,
|p + 1  ni} with
energy en = ep+1n = f (n), n = 1, . . . , p/2. the supercharges q and q have to transform
mutually the states in each supersymmetric doublet and annihilate the singlet state |0i. one
can specify them by the relations

q|0i = 0, q|p + 1  ni  |ni, q|ni = 0,

q|0i = 0, q|ni  |p + 1  ni, q|p + 1  ni = 0,

(2.6)

where n = 1, ..., p/2. these relations mean that the operator q transforms the rst half of
the states forming supersymmetric doublets into the second half states while the conjugate
operator q acts in the opposite direction. eqs. (2.6) and (2.5) lead to the relations

q2 = (q)2 = 0,

[q, hn] = [q, hn] = 0,

(2.7)

4

meaning that the operators q and q are the mutually conjugate conserving nilpotent op-
erators, i.e. are the supercharges.
in correspondence with eqs. (2.6), (2.7), they can be
represented in the form

q =

(2.8)

n are the projectors, p p

leads to the usual n = 1 superalgebra given by eq. (2.7) and

{q, q} = hn.

(2.12)

(2.13)

the supercharges given by eqs. (2.8) and (2.12) can be represented in a more compact
form. for the purpose, let us introduce the z2-grading operator  dened by the relations
2 = 1, [, h] = 0, {, q} = {, q} = 0. it can be chosen in the form

p

2 and n = p
then the states |ni with n = 0, . . . , p
2 , . . . , p have the parities +1 and 1,
respectively. on the other hand, the operators f and f  do not have denite parity (they are
neither even nor odd operators). using the relation (2.11), one can represent the supercharges
in the form

f = (f (n + 1))1/2f,

f  = (f (n))1/2f ,

satisfying the relations f p+1 = ( f )p+1 = 0, ( f )n f n = pp
also represent the supercharges as

k=0 p p

k , one can

q = q(n) f 2n p1p, q = q(n)( f )p+12n p+,

(2.17)

with (n) = f (n).

now let us turn to the case of odd p, where the system described by the hamiltonian
hn = f f = f (n) is characterized by the presence of two singlet (unpaired) states |0i and
| p+1

(2.22)

with its help we represent the supercharges (2.18) in the form (2.15), where now the pro-
jectors p are dened in terms of grading operator (2.22), and c p(n) is given by eq. (2.21)

6

with f (n) replaced by f (n). in terms of the operators (2.16) the supercharges can also be
given in the form (2.17) with (n) = f (n)(n), where (n) is given by eq. (2.19) with
f (n) substituted for f (n).

therefore, for odd p the system hn = f f can be characterized by the nonlinear su-
peralgebra (2.7), (2.20), and we conclude that in general case of the even and odd order
generalized parafermions the anticommutator of supercharges is given by the polynomial of
the hamiltonian whose order coincides with the number of singlet states. this resembles the
property of the supersymmetry in pure parabosonic systems with normal ordered hamilto-
nian where the order of the polynomial appearing in the anticommutator of supercharges
coincides with the number of singlet states in the system, which, in turn, is dened by the
order of the paraboson.

however, here, unlike the parabosonic case, the systems given by hn and ha reveal, in
fact, the same supersymmetry. indeed, due to the symmetry relation (2.5), the spectrum
of the hamiltonian ha = f f  = f (n + 1) is a mirror reection of the spectrum of the
hamiltonian hn = f f = f (n) with respect to the middle point of the interval [0, p]. as
a consequence, all the analysis and formulas for the supersymmetric parafermionic systems
described by ha may be immediately obtained from those given above for the systems with
hn via the formal substitutions f  f , f   f, n  p  n, and we do not expose them
explicitly.

2.3 spontaneously broken supersymmetry

let us consider the parafermionic system given by the quadratic hamiltonian

hs = f f + f f .

(2.23)

when the associated characteristic function satises the symmetry relation (2.5), the spec-
trum of (2.23) is also supersymmetric (see fig. 2). however, this time the spectrum has
no energy zero level, but,
instead, the lowest energy level is positive and degenerated:
e0 = ep = f (1) > 0. therefore, the system described by the hamiltonian (2.23) has
the features of the system realizing spontaneously broken supersymmetry. here, as for the
supersymmetric systems given by hn and ha, two cases have to be distinguished: with odd
ps all the states are paired in supersymmetric doublets, whereas the case of even ps is
characterized by the presence of one singlet state | p

2i.

the supercharge for the system (2.23) can be realized in the form

q =

[ p+1

(2.26)

one can represent the supercharges in the form

q = c p(n)f 2n pp, q = (f )p2n c p(n)p+,

where c p(n) is obtained from eq. (2.24) with n substituted for n. the operators (2.16)
give the alternative representation

q = q(n) f 2n pp, q = q(n)( f )p2n p+,

where (n) = f (n) + f (n + 1) = hs for odd p and (n) = e p

 hs for even p.

thus, here in both cases of even and odd ps the anticommutator of supercharges is linear
in hamiltonian hs, but its form is dierent due to dierent structure of the corresponding
spectra.

3 finite-dimensional supersymmetric systems

in this section we consider the particular examples of supersymmetric nite-dimensional
systems related to various deformation schemes of the oscillator algebra, for which the results
of the previous section can be applied.

3.1 parafermionic oscillator

the algebra of the usual parafermions [1] is dened by the relations

{f, f } = p + 2pn  2n 2,

[f, f ] = p  2n,

8

from which the trilinear parafermionic relations, [[f , f ], f ] = 2f , [[f , f ], f ] = 2f , and
the vacuum relation f f |0i = p|0i can be immediately obtained. the comparison with eq.
(2.2) gives the parafermionic structure function:

f (n) = n(p + 1  n).

(3.1)

it possesses the symmetry property (2.5) which leads to the discussed supersymmetries.

3.2 finite-dimensional q-deformed oscillator

the q-deformed oscillator is dened by the relation [13, 14, 15]

aa  q1aa = qn .

the structure function of this system is

f (n) = fq(n) =

qn  qn
q  q1 .

(3.2)

when q is a primitive root of unity of the even order, q2(p+1) = 1, i.e. q = ei 
p+1 , the
system has the (p + 1)-dimensional fock type representation, characterized by the relations
ap+1 = (a)p+1 = 0. in this case the structure function acquires the form

f (n) =

sin n
p+1
sin 
p+1

,

(3.3)

and obeys the symmetry condition (2.5).

3.3 the q-deformed parafermionic oscillator

the q-deformed parafermionic algebra [16, 17] is dened by the structure function

f (n) = fq(n)fq(p + 1  n),

where fq(n) is given by eq. (3.2). this structure function obeys the symmetry relation
(2.5). at q = ei 
p+1 we have the (p+1)-dimensional representation with the structure function
which, due to eq. (2.5), is reduced to the square of the structure function (3.3):

f (n) =

sin2 n
p+1
sin2 
p+1

.

(3.4)

all three systems (3.1), (3.3) and (3.4) possess the spectra corresponding to the exact
(unbroken) and spontaneously broken supersymmetry of the type shown on figs. 1 and 2.
note that in this context the fermion system (p = 1, f (n) = n(2  n)) with hamiltonian
hs = {f , f } = 1 realizes the simplest case of spontaneously broken supersymmetry.

9

3.4 parafermionic oscillator with internal z2 structure

the even order parafermionic oscillator with internal z2 structure is associated with the r-
deformed heisenberg algebra which, in turn, is related to parabosons [10]. the r-deformed
heisenberg algebra is generated by the operators {1, a, r} satisfying the (anti)commutation
relations (1.1), where   r is a deformation parameter and r is the reection operator.
the structure function of this algebra is

f (n) = n + 

1
2

(1  (1)n ) = n +  sin2 n
2

.

(3.5)

on the half-line  > 1, it is positive denite, f (n) > 0 for n = 1, 2, . . ., that means that the
algebra (1.1) with  > 1 has innite-dimensional unitary representations. when  = p  1,
p = 1, 2, . . ., they are the representations of the parabosonic oscillator system of the order
p. in the case of odd s,  = 2k + 1, k = 0, . . ., the structure function (3.5) satises the
relation f (2n + 1) = f (2n +  + 1) underlying the supersymmetries of the pure parabosonic
systems given by the hamiltonians hn = a+a = f (n) and ha = aa+ = f (n + 1) [7].

though the algebra (1.1) emerges from generalizing the bosonic harmonic oscillator sys-
tem [1], it has also the nite-dimensional representations of the parafermionic nature [10].
indeed, at the special values of the deformations parameter,  =  (p + 1), p = 2, 4, 6, ...
the structure function (3.5) satises the relation f (p + 1) = 0, which signals on existence
of (p + 1)-dimensional irreducible representations of the algebra (1.1), in which the relations
(a)p+1 = 0 are valid. however, in this case the structure function f (n) is not positive-
denite, and the corresponding nite-dimensional representations are not unitary. in such
representations the creation-annihilation operators a are mutually conjugate with respect to
the indenite scalar product. on the other hand, with respect to the usual positive denite
scalar product they are related as (a+) = ar [10]. therefore, dening new creation-
annihilation operators f = ar, f  = a+, we arrive at the following parafermionic type
algebra of the even order:

{f, f } = p + 1  r,

f p+1 = (f )p+1 = 0,

{r, f } = {r, f } = 0,

p = 2k.

(3.6)

due to the presence of the reection operator r = (1)n , the algebra has the natural
internal z2 structure. the structure function of this parafermionic type system is

f (n) = n(1)n + (p + 1) sin2 n
2

.

(3.7)

the property (2.5) is valid for the function (3.7). since this nite-dimensional oscillator with
internal z2 structure has the parafermionic type algebra of the even order, the corresponding
unbroken supersymmetry (for hn and ha) is characterized by the presence of only one singlet
state. in the simplest case p = 2 the spectrum en = (0, 2, 2) of hn has a form of the type
shown on fig. 1b. for p = 2k, k > 1, the spectrum of hn has a non-typical x-like form,
being a superposition of the increasing and decreasing spectra of the subspaces of even and
odd states, e2l = 2l, l = 0, ..., k, and e2l+1 = 2(k  l), l = 0, ..., k  1.

on the other hand, due to eq. (3.6), here the hamiltonian hs = {f +, f } has a two-level
degenerated spectrum for all p = 2k. therefore, the present parafermionic system has a
spectrum of spontaneously broken n = 1 supersymmetry only in the simplest case p = 2,
whereas the cases p = 4, 6, . . . , correspond to spontaneously broken extended supersymmetry.

10

3.5 generalized supersymmetry with several singlet states

as we have seen in the previous subsection,
in the case of the hamiltonian hs the
parafermionic oscillator system with internal z2 structure is dierent from other systems:
here only p = 2 corresponds to spontaneously broken n = 1 supersymmetry, while the cases
p = 4, 6, . . . give spontaneously broken extended supersymmetry. the specic nature of the
structure function f (n) can reveal itself in a particular way in other cases too. let us
show that with the usual parafermions (3.1) one can realize the specic supersymmetries
generalizing those already discussed. they are characterized by the presence of arbitrary
(but xed) number of singlet states which denes the nonlinear order of the corresponding
superalgebra.

such generalized supersymmetries can be found in the systems given by the hamiltonian

hk = {f , f } + k[f , f ] + p(|k|  1),

k  z,

p  |k| + 1.

(3.8)

at k = 1, 0, 1, the hamiltonian hk is reduced to 2ha, hs  p and 2hn, respectively, and for
k 6= 0 it has the spectra which contain |k| (|k|1) positive energy singlet states in addition to
zero energy ground state when p  k is even (odd). we note here that analogous generalized
supersymmetric hamiltonian can also be constructed for the case of nite-dimensional q-
deformed oscillator (3.2). for k > 0 the corresponding supercharges associated with (3.8)
can be realized in the form similar to (2.17),

q = q(n) f 2n pkp, q = q(n)( f)p+k2n p+,

with

(n) = h  h(hk)

|k|1

(hk  em),

y

m=0

where em is the energy of the state |mi, h(hk) = 1 when p  k is odd, h(hk) = emax  hk
for even p  k and emax = e p+k

. the anticommutator of supercharges is given here by

2

{q, q} = h,

i.e. it is a polynomial in hk, whose order coincides with the number of singlet states. the
case k < 0 is obtained via the formal change f   f , f  f , m  p  m.

4 summary and outlook

we have shown that the single-mode parafermionic type systems possess supersymmetry. it
is based on the symmetry relation f (n) = f (p + 1  n) of the characteristic function of the
known generalized parafermions related to the deformed oscillator (2.1) of daskaloyannis et al
[11, 12]. the simplest quadratic hamiltonians hn = f f = f (n) and ha = f f  = f (n + 1)
describe the systems with unbroken supersymmetry specied by the presence of one zero
energy ground state in the spectrum, while the hamiltonian hs = f f + f f  represents the
system in the phase of spontaneously broken supersymmetry, characterized by the doublet of
positive energy ground states. besides, the form of supersymmetry depends on whether the

11

2 i for hn, or | p1

order p of the parafermion is even or odd. in the case of the systems with exact supersymme-
try for even p there is only one singlet state (of zero energy) in the systems spectrum (|0i for
hn and |pi for ha) and the anticommutator of the supercharges is equal to the hamiltonian,
i.e. we have here the usual superalgebra (2.7), (2.13) of the n = 1 supersymmetry. in the
case of odd p, the systems with unbroken supersymmetry possess another singlet state with
positive energy, | p+1
2 i for ha, in addition to the zero energy ground state.
as a consequence, for odd ps the anticommutator of the supercharges is given by the poly-
nomial quadratic in the hamiltonian (see eq. (2.20)). the supersymmetries of the systems
given by the normal ordered hamiltonian hn and by the antinormal ordered hamiltonian
ha turn out to be the same due to the relation f (n) = f (p + 1  n) underlying supersymme-
try. in the case of spontaneously broken supersymmetry, the case of odd p is characterized
by the presence of only supersymmetric doublets in the spectrum, whereas the spectra of
parafermionic systems of even order p contain one singlet state | p
2i with positive energy. in
both cases the superalgebra is linear in hs, but its concrete form is dierent (see eq. (2.25)).
with the quadratic hamiltonian (3.8), one can generalize the parafermionic supersymmetries
of the systems with hn, ha:
in this case the spectra are characterized by the presence of
|k| or |k|  1 singlet states in addition to zero energy ground state and the superalgebra is
characterized by the corresponding polynomial in hk appearing in the anticommutator of
supercharges q and q. these properties are similar to those characterizing supersymmet-
ric pure parabosonic systems [7]. as in the case of parabosonic supersymmetry, a peculiar
nature of the described supersymmetries of parafermionic systems with quadratic hamilto-
nians is encoded in nonlinear structure of the corresponding supercharges being represented
in terms of only creation-annihilation operators f , f .

it is interesting to note here that similar nonlinear superalgebraic structure with the
anticommutator of the supercharges being quadratic in the hamiltonian was observed earlier
by isaev and malik in the system of q-deformed bosonic and fermionic oscillators [18]. like in
the present case, their hamiltonian is quadratic in creation-annihilation operators and looks
like the hamiltonian of uncoupled (deformed) bosonic and fermionic oscillators. moreover,
like in the usual superoscillator (but unlike the systems treated here), the odd supercharges
of the supersymmetric system of ref. [18] are quadratic in bosonic-fermionic operators, but
the nonlinearity turns out to be encoded in a nontrivial mutual coupling of the oscillators
via the corresponding q-deformed commutation relations.

the observed supersymmetries of parafermionic systems can be used for construction of
new types of parasupersymmetry [19]. indeed, in the simplest case of the hamiltonian hps =
bb+h, where b, b are the bosonic creation-annihilation operators and h is the hamiltonian
hn, ha or hs of the usual parafermions (3.1), we get the system with parasupersymmetric
spectrum. in the lower part the spectrum is dierent from that of the rubakov-spiridonov
parasupersymmetric system hpsusy = bb+ 1
2([f , f ]+p) [6]. for the same purpose, one can use
the appropriate linear combination of one of the supersymmetric parabosonic hamiltonians
with one of the supersymmetric parafermionic hamiltonians.

we have treated the parafermionic systems given by the hamiltonians of the simplest
quadratic form. however, it is clear that the hamiltonians of the form h = f (h) with
arbitrary function f of h = hn, ha, hs also possess the supersymmetric spectra. the same
is true for the analogous generalization of the parabosonic systems. therefore, the observed
supersymmetries of the single-mode parabosonic and parafermionic systems survive under

12

generalization to the case of the self-interacting systems.
it seems that generalizing the
present single-mode constructions to the many-modes oscillator systems, one could arrive at
the physically interesting supersymmetric quantum eld systems, formulated, e.g., in terms
of only one parabosonic or parafermionic eld.
