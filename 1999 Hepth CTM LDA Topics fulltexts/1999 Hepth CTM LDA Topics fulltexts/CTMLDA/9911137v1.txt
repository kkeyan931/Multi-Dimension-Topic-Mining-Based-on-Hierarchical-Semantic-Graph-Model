we study type iib supergravity in the presence of (euclidean) d3 branes and nonzero

self-dual b-elds. we point out that the einstein frame metric is identical to the full

geometry for d3 branes without b elds turned on. furthermore, in a decoupling limit

in which the theory is conjectured to be dual to noncommutative yang-mills theory, the

entire einstein metric remains intact, and in particular, is asymptotically at. we con-

struct d-instanton solutions in this geometry. we show that in the decoupling limit the

d-instanton action agrees with the action of the corresponding instanton in the noncom-

mutative yang-mills theory and is expressed in terms of the open string coupling. some

other aspects of this correspondence, which have unusual features because the underlying

metric is asymptotically at, are explored.

1. introduction

the observation that the low energy dynamics of d-branes in the presence of constant

nsns b elds is noncommutative yang-mills theory [1] has opened up the possibility of

exploring string theory in a new limit. in this limit the string tension is scaled to innity,

and at the same time the closed string metric is scaled to zero, keeping the dimensionful

nsns b eld xed [2]. this is dierent from the usual low energy limit where the closed

string metric and the dimensionless nsns b-eld are kept xed as the tension scales to

innity. as a result, the lowest order eective action on the brane contains an innite

number of terms with all powers of the eld strength when written in terms of ordinary

gauge elds and conventional gauge symmetry. however, as shown in [2], in terms of

noncommutative gauge elds, one has a simple lagrangian. the fact that an innite number

of terms may be neatly summarized in terms of a dierent geometric structure raises hopes

that one may be able to perform concrete calculations in this new corner of string theory.

various aspects of noncommutative gauge theory and its relationship with string theory

have been studied in [3].

over the past two years it has become clear that large-n supersymmetric yang-mills

theories are holographic descriptions of string theories in suitable backgrounds, [4] one of
the best understood example being the duality between large-n n = 4 yang-mills theory
in four space-time dimensions and iib string theory on ads5  s5. when the t hooft
coupling of the yang-mills theory is strong the dual string theory reduces to supergravity.

the yang-mills theory in question is the low energy theory of n three branes and the
ads5  s5 background of the supergravity is the near-horizon limit of the three-brane
it is natural to expect that in the presence of a b eld, one would have
background.

a similar correspondence between noncomuutative yang-mills theory and supergravity

backgrounds in the presence of suitable b elds. indeed in [5] and [6] dual supergravity

backgrounds for noncommutative boundary theories were proposed and certain aspects of

holography were investigated in [6] and [7]. other examples of such backgrounds have

recently appeared in [8].

in this paper we will continue the study of the supergravity background dual to 3 + 1

dimensional noncommutative su (n ) yang mills theory. there are two motivations for

this study. first, as in the ordinary case, one might hope to learn something about

noncommutative yang mills theory at large thooft coupling in this way. second, and

perhaps more interestingly, one might hope to learn about holography in contexts other

than those of ads space.

1

in particular we will focus on the case where the two form b elds are self dual.

in this case as was discussed in [2] the instanton moduli space in the noncommutative

yang mills theory is the same as that of ordinary yang mills theory and in particular,

the size of the instanton is one of the moduli. correspondingly, the d-instanton is a bps

state state in the theory and one expects to be able to localize it anywhere in the bulk

supergravity geometry. the situation is therefore similar to that of d-instantons in ads

space [9] where the location of the d-instanton explicitly maps to the scale size of the

yang mills instanton and one point functions in the d-instanton background accurately

reproduce the yang mills instanton prole [10]. the hope is that in the non-commutative

case as well the study of instantons for the self dual case would be revealing in the study
of the ir/uv relation and more generally holography4.

another, and perhaps deeper, reason for being interested in the supergravity back-

ground for the case b = 0 comes from attempts to understand holography in at space.

as we will see below, the einstein frame metric for self dual b eld congurations, in

the scaling limit which corresponds to noncommutative yang mills theory, is the full three

brane geometry in the absence of a b eld. this remarkable fact has several implications.

the most noteworthy being that the geometry with a self dual b eld is in fact asymp-

totically at. we should add that other elds in particular the dilaton and axion are not

constant. even so, this fact suggests that ultraviolet noncommutative yang mills theory

should help in understanding holography in at 10-dim. space. it has been suggested in

[12] that in the case without b elds the full d3 brane geometry corresponds to keeping

the born-infeld action in the yang mills theory and not truncating to the lowest dimension

operator. here we see that the eect of exciting the other elds in supergravity- dilaton-

axion and two forms- corresponds in the yang mills theory to a dierent choice of higher

dimension operators -those which can be organised into the noncommutative yang mills

lagrangian.

this paper is structured as follows. in section 2, we review the supergravity solution

for a self dual b eld and in particular show that its near horizon limit gives rise to the full

three brane geometry without a b eld turned on. in section 3, we then construct the d-

instanton solution. because of the remarks above, this is also a solution for a d-instanton

4 of course instantons in the general case when b 6= 0 are also interesting, perhaps even
more so, since in that case the moduli space is dierent from the ordinary yang mills case and in

particular the small instanton singularity is absent [11] . however, since these are not threshold

bound states the supergravity solutions are harder to nd.

of the solution, and nally section 5, some aspects of holography.

2. supergravity solutions with self dual b elds

2.1 the backgound geometry

we will nd euclidean solutions to the iib supergravity equations of motion which

are listed in appendix i. in our notation, the ns elds will be real while the rr elds will

be purely imaginary. start with the following ansatz, for the dilaton , rr scalar , and
ns and rr two form potentials b and b .

 + i  e = ic

h = ich
b01 = b23

b01 =  b23

(2.1)

(2.2)

where c is a real constant. here h and h denote the eld strengths for b and b. this
ansatz is motivated by supersymmetry in the following section.

with this ansatz, the energy momentum tensors of  and  cancel each other and so

does those of b and b so that einstein equations (7.1) become

r 

1
2

g r = t f
 ,

(2.3)

where t f

 denotes the stress energy of the ve form eld strength. the ve form in turn

is determined by gauss law

(gf  ) = 0.

1
g

(2.4)

finally, the dilaton and the axion equations ((7.2) and (7.3) respectively) both reduce to

the following equation

2(e) +

1
6

hh  = 0

while the b and the b equations ((7.4) and (7.5) respectively) both become

1
g

(gh ) 

2
3

i f h = 0.

(2.5)

(2.6)

the important point is that with the ansatz, (2.2) (2.1) the equations for the metric

(2.3) and the 5-form, (2.4) form a closed set independent of the two-forms and the dilaton

3

and axion elds. thus if a solution consistent with the ansatz (2.2) exists it give rise to

a metric and 5-form identical to the case of the d3 brane solution without any two-form

elds turned on.

one of the supergravity backgrounds presented in [6] is in fact a solution of the
equations of motion with the ansatz (2.2). the metric (in the einstein frame) is given 5

(2.10)

the parameter  is related to the b-elds at r = , gs is the asymptotic value of the
string coupling and

r4 =

.

(2.11)

this is a solution of the equations of motion with the ansatz (2.2) with c =  cos2 
and
 = 1. a similar solution can be of course written down with  = 1. in particular we
note that the metric and ve-form are independent of  and equal to their values for a d3

gs

brane geometry without any b elds turned on.

now one can take a scaling limit which corresponds to the low-energy limit of [2] that

gives rise to noncommutative yang mills theory. this is given by [6]:

(2.12)

and the ns-ns 2-form elds. we have checked explicitly that the following solves the equations

of motion.

(2.13)

the reader will notice that the harmonic function appearing in the metric cannot be
not truncated to its near horizon value 6. instead, as was mentioned in the introduction,

the full d3 brane metric survives in this limit.

the full solution in this limit can be written in terms of the variable

u = r/(r2)

(2.14)

used in [6]. after the rescaling coordinates xi along the brane as:

xi  xi =

the coupling has been also redened

while r4, dened in (2.11) can be expressed as

6 this is because the string coupling is also being scaled to zero.

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

note that the coupling g is precisely the open string coupling which appears in non-

commutative yang-mills theory in the low energy limit dened in [2].

the metric (2.16) becomes ads5 s5 near the horizon, u = 0 and g is the value of the
string coupling in the ir. the b elds vanish at u = 0 and asymptote to /b as u  .
it is important to note that the scaling limit considered above is not the near-horizon

limit of the full geometry. this is the supergravity reection of a corresponding feature of

the low energy limit of the d3 brane theory considered in [2], viz. the fact that arbitrarily

high powers of the (ordinary) eld strengths survive.

in the rest of the paper we will work with the variables of (2.16)and rename x  x.

2.2 d-instanton solution

we now turn to determining the d-instanton solution in the background (2.7). we

have already emphasized that (2.3)and (2.4) are independent of the two-forms and the

dilaton-axion elds. in addition, the equation (2.6) for the three-form eld strength does

not involve the dilaton or axion elds either. denoting the dilaton and axion elds appear-

ing in (2.7) as 0, 0 it then follows that a solution dierent from (2.9) can be obtained with
the same einstein metric, two form elds and ve form eld strength but with dierent

dilaton and axion values  and 

so that

and

 = 0 + 

i + e =

g

) = 0

2(e

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

we are now ready to write down the equation satised by the elds due to a d-

instanton. the metric, b-elds and the ve form eld strength are exactly the same as in
(2.9). since the d-instanton couples to the dilaton and axion, the equation satsied by 
is modied from (2.23) at the location of the instanton.

the d-instanton action is given by,

si = 2 z [e + i]10(x  x)d10x.

(2.24)

here x = (x0    x3, u, i) is the location of the d-instanton (with i denote the angles
parametrizing the s5). thus the equation for the dilaton eld is given by

e(x,x) = e0(u) + e

(x,x)

(2.25)

6

where

2
x(e

(x,x)) = 42

10

10(x  x)

g

.

(2.26)

in other words we have to solve for the scalar greens function in the metric given in (2.9).

this establishes the existence of the d-instanton solution in the presence of d3 branes

and a nonzero b eld. in the following section we will nd explicit solutions to (2.26) in

the decoupling limit, i.e in the background given by (2.16).

before doing so let us make one comment regarding the instanton action (2.24). we

started by an ansatz for solutions to supergravity equations. this ansatz can be in fact

be motivated by the action (2.24). as was mentioned in the introduction, we expect in

the self dual case that the three brane geometry should allow for a d instanton localised

anywhere in the bulk. this means that the d-instanton action must be a constant. from

(2.24) we see that this implies the condition (2.1). a similar argument then also shows

that the full instanton and background solution satises (2.22). in the more general case
where b 6= 0, and the instanton moduli space is deformed from the ordinary case, (2.24)
will yield the potential generated in moduli space in the large thooft coupling limit 7.

3. the smeared d-instanton solution

we will now nd the solution of (2.26) in the decoupling limit which is smeared over
the s5. in other words we look for solutions of the equation which do not depend on the

angles i. this would give us the eld due to a d-instanton which is smeared over the
ve sphere - the eld would be then independent of i. furthermore, using translation
invariance along the brane directions x0    x3 this solution may be written as

where gk(u, u) now solves

u(u5ugk)  u(1 + a4u4) k2 gk = (u  u)

(3.1)

(3.2)

note that we are looking for euclidean solutions so that k2 > 0. also gk should be regular
as u  0, and gk  0 when u  . the normalisation in (3.1) is obtained from (2.26)
by integrating over the s5 and noting that the volume of the unit ve sphere is 3.

7 we thank d. tong for a conversation on this point.

7

the greens function can be expressed in terms of solutions to the homogeneous

equation,

u(u5ugk)  u(1 + a4u4) k2 k = 0,

(3.3)

by standard strum-liouville theory techniques. (3.3) was studied in [13] and subsequently

also encountered in [6], for computing the two point function of a particular supergravity

mode. solutions to (3.3) can be written as

k(, u) =

1
u2 k(, u),

where k(, w) solves the mathieu equation,

[2
w + 2q cosh 2w  4]k(, w) = 0

with

and,

u =

1
a

ew,

q = (ka)2.

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

the parameter  which enters the solution is determined by recursion relations and may

be expressed as a power series in (ka) as [13]

(3.8)

in order to implement the boundary conditions on the greens function we need two
solutions to (3.3) one being regular at u  0 and the second going to zero as u  .
in the asymptotic region, |w|  1, solutions to the mathieu equation can be expressed in
terms of modied bessel functions. the two required solutions can then be written down

as :

(1)

k (, u) =

k (, u) =

2u2 e

i

2 h (1)(, w)

.

(3.9)

here, we are using the notation of [13] and h (1)(, w) denotes a solution which asymptot-

ically is related to the modied bessel function, k, i.e.,

k (, u) is well behaved at u = 0 while (2)

k (, u)  0 at u = , as

now using strum liouville theory the greens function is given by:

gk(u, u) = a2(k, a) (1)
gk(u, u) = a2(k, a) (1)

k (, u) (2)
k (, u) (2)

k (, u)

k (, u)

u < u

the normalization a2(k, a) has to be determined by requiring that

(3.11)

(3.12)

where w ((1)
k ) denotes the wronskian of the two solutions. more detailed forms of
the asymptotic behavior of these functions and the calculation of the wronskian is given

k , (2)

in appendix ii.

the result for the wronskian xes the normalization appearing in (3.11) to be

a2(ka) =

the parameter  and the function () (introduced in appendix ii) are explicitly dened

in terms of the parameters in the mathieu equation. however we will be able to extract

some of the physics by knowing asymptotic forms. in appendix ii we derive the small ka

behavior of the various functions which appear in the solution to mathieus equation. in

particular it is shown that

(3.17)

this is what is expected from the dierential equation denining gk ,equation (3.3) and is
in fact the zero momentum greens function in ads5 as well. corrections to this extreme
limit may be worked out systematically.

this shows that it is useful to recast (3.14) in a somewhat dierent form. the zero
k=0(, u) decays for large u not exponentially but as a power
it is useful for various purposes to show this dependence explicitly. thus we can

momentum component of (2)

(3.18)

where the rst term is the zero momentum piece, with l4 being the volume along the four

directions parallel to the 3 branes. the integral in (3.18) is understood to be over the

non-zero momentum modes.

it may be checked that the solution (3.18) reproduces known limits. when both u
and u are small and at small momenta we should recover the d-instanton in ads5  s5 of
[9]. similarly when both u and u are large we should recover the d-instanton in at space.

this may be checked from the asymptotic expansions.

in the next section, we will discuss aspects of holography in this space-time. the
boundary will be taken at u = . the nal results should reproduce the ads results in the
ka << 1 limit. it is easy to see that in the limit (ka) << 1 with y = k/u xed the solutions

reduce to the solutions for the ads5 problem. however the holographic correspondence
we are interested in involves taking u =  rst, before taking the (ka) << 1 limit. this
latter limit is nontrivial.

one comment is worth making at this point. we saw in section 2 that the d-instanton

solution is given by the greens function for (2.26). the metric which appears in (2.26) is

the full three brane metric. thus (3.18) also provides the solution for the d-instanton in

the full d3 brane geometry (with no two -form elds turned on). although we will not

do so here, using (2.14) (3.18) can be expressed in terms of the radial coordinate r in a

straightforward manner.

4. supersymmetry of the solution

the type iib theory has thirty two supersymmetries. in this section we will consider

a solution of the kind (2.1) (2.2) and show that it preserves sixteen of the thirty two

supersymmetries. for deniteness we will consider the case where  = 1 which is the

choice made in this paper. the supersymmetry variations of the dilatino and the gravitino

are given by

where

gm np = i2 ( |1  i|

) (hrr   h)m np .

1 and hrr are related to the elds used in this paper by the relations:

1 = i

hrr = i h.

thus, from (2.1) and ( = 1) we have

and

2  1 = c

hrr  (2  1)h = 0.

(4.1) and (4.2) are supersymmetry transformations in minkowski space.

in going

over to euclidean space we follow [14] and replace the usual algebra of complex numbers

generated over real numbers by (1, i) with hyperbolic complex numbers generated over
real numbers by (1, e) with e2 = 1. thus (1 + i2)  (1 + e2),  = 1 + i2  1 + e2

11

etc. then using the fact that e2 = 1, (4.7) and (4.8) it is easy to verify that the dilatino

variation is zero if 1 and 2 satises the relation

1 = 2.

(4.9)

as far as the gravitino variation is concerned we nd from (4.7) (4.8) and (4.9) that

the third term involving the derivative of  and its complex conjugate vanish. also the

last term involving gm np vanishes. thus the gravitino variation becames:

 = (1 + e2) +

1

ab
 ab(1 + e2) +

480

1 5 f1 5 (1 + e2)

(4.10)

we argued in section 2 that for the ansatz (2.1) (2.2) the metric and ve form eld

strengths are independent of the two form elds and take the same form that they have in

the d3 brane solution without any two-form expectation values. with this in mind we see

that the (4.10) is exactly the same as for d3 branes without any additional two-form elds

turned on. it follows then that the solution (2.1) (2.2) preserve sixteen supersymmetries.

it also follows that the spinors 1, 2 which satisfy (4.10) and (4.9) are the same as in the

case of d3 branes without the two-form.

5. holography

d- instantons in ads5 were studied in [9] and shown to correspond to instantons in

the yang mills theory. one expects the relationship to be more general and in partic-

ular to hold in the non-commutative yang mills theory as well. in this section we will

study the correspondence further by calculating the action and correlation functions in

the background of the d-instanton solution determined above and relating them to the

corresponding quantities for an instanton in the yang mills theory. our calculations will

be dierent from the case of ads5 space in one important way. for the geometry un-

der consideration here, the einstein metric eq. (2.16) (to which the dilaton couples for

example) asymptotically becames at 10 dimensional spacetime. thus in relating the d

instanton to the yang mills instanton we will neccessarily have to deal with some of the

diculties of holography in at space.

below, we denote the supergravity solution described in maldacena and russo (with

a antiself dual b eld turned on ) as the background geometry.

12

the d instanton solution in this background is given by:

e

 = c1z [d4k] eik(xx) a2(k, a) (1)

k (, u) (2)

k (, u)

u > u

(5.1)

the axion is related to the dilaton through the condition

e + i =

1
g

,

(5.2)

and the metric and other three-form elds are the same as in the background solution.

to begin calculating in the supergravity theory we start with the supergravity action

which is :

s =

1
42

10 z d10xg[()2 + e2()2] + sb +   

(5.3)

the bulk action is well known. sb above denotes a boundary term which is a little subtle
to determine but important since it plays a crucial role in holography. for at space the

boundary term was determined in [15] , by working in terms of a eight form gauge potential

dual to the axion, to be:

sb = 

1
22

10 z dsne2n.

(5.4)

[15] showed that (5.4) gave the correct action for a d-instanton. one can also show that

(5.4) gives the correct action for a d-instanton in ads space. carrying out a duality

transformation to the eight form is not straightforward in the present context since the

three form eld strenghts etc. are turned on as well. even so we will that the boundary
term (5.4) is unchanged here as well 8. as we will see below, this choice yields sensible

answers at least for small perturbations about the background geometry.

5.2 the instanton action

one can now calculate the action for the instanton solution, (3.18). from (5.3) and

(5.2) we see that the contribution from the bulk action vanishes. as was discussed in [15]

since the d-instanton is a singular solution we need to consider two boundaries. one,

as expected, is at large u, where the einstein metric is asymptotically at; the other is

an innitesimal surface surrounding the location of the d-instanton. consider rst the

boundary at innity. since the background geometry is translationally invariant along

the branes, only the zero momentum piece of the instanton solution (3.18) contributes

to the boundary action. we denote the background as (0, 0) and write the dilaton

8 intutively one would expect this boundary term because asymptotically the three form gauge

potentials go to zero and one can at least in that region dualise the axion eld.

13

as e = e0 + e  and  = 0 + i . then using the fact that the full solution and the
background satisfy (5.2) the leading dependence on the d-instanton in the boundary action

(i.e. after subtracting an innite contribution from the background) is :

sb = i
22

10 z dsn (0ne

 + i ne0 )

(5.5)

using the zero momentum piece from (3.18)and the condition (5.2) one nds that this

vanishes. that leaves nally the second boundary: an innitesimal surface around the

location of the d-instanton. in this case one gets that the relevant term which contributes

is :

sb = i
22

10 z dsnne
.

(5.6)

since e  satises the (2.26) it diverges at the location of the d-instanton. thus from (5.2)
g . substituting in (5.6) and using the equation satised by e  (equation
we see that i  1
(2.26)), we nally get the action of the d-instanton to be

s =

2
g

(5.7)

this result agrees with the action of an instanton in the noncommutative yang mills

theory. note that, in the decoupling limit of [2] g is the open string coupling. this is

related to the yang mills coupling by

4g = g2

y m

(this can be shown for example from the born infeld action). thus (5.7) yields,

s = 82/g2

y m .

(5.8)

(5.9)

this is in fact the classical action of an instanton in the non-commutative yang mills theory,

as shown e.g.

in [16] further, since the instanton is a bps state we expect its action to

not get any quantum corrections and is therefore expected to agree with a supergravity

computation.

it is worth pausing to emphasise that the calculation above in type ii closed string

theory yielded an answer in terms of the open string coupling constant g. in fact g is related

to the closed string coupling gs by the relation (2.19) involving the non-commutativity
parameter explicitly. by way of contrast we note that had we not taken the scaling limit

of the solution (2.9) an analysis along the above lines ( with the same boundary term

14

) shows that the action of the d-instanton is s = 2/gs. the agreement between the
d-instanton action (5.7) and the yang mills instanton obtained above provides additional

evidence that the scaling limit (2.16) accurately implements the decoupling limit described

in [2].

5.3 one point functions

as mentioned above, we would like to use the d instanton solution to calculate expec-

tation values for operators in the instanton background of the yang mills theory. three

steps are involved determining the expecation values of operators in the yang mills theory

from a supergravity solution. first, one determines the normal modes for small uctua-

tions about the background solution. next, one computes the change in action to linear

order in the small uctuations. finally, one determines the operator in the yang mills

theory which corresponds to the supergravity normal mode and relates the change in the

action to the one point function of the corresponding operator in the yang mills theory.

here we will focus on one normal mode which satises the condition

 + ie = 0.

(5.10)

the discussion leading to the instanton solution in section 2 shows that a perturbation

(5.10) satises the equations of motion if

2(e) = 0.

solutions to this equation behave asymptotically, for large u, like

e  z

d4k
(2)4 c(~k)u5/2[eka2u + b(ka)eka2u]

(5.11)

(5.12)

in computing the one point function we rst compute the change in the action for

a perturbation about the background to second order. for this purpose it is useful to

remember that when (5.10) is met, the full solution, consisting of background and pertur-

bation, satises (5.2). thus the bulk contribution vanishes and the change in the action
arises entierly from the boundary term (5.4). expanding this to second order gives 9 a

surface term of the form:

s =

1
22

10 z dsn e20 (e) n(e).

(5.13)

9 the one point function of this peturbation vanishes and this can be shown in exact analogy

with the discussion of the instanton action above.

15

the surface integral is at xed value of u = u0. now we substitute

 =  + i ,

where i denotes the instanton background,

e0 + e

 = e0+i

and  is given by (5.12). this yields:

s = (

5
u0

)e20 z

(1)

k (, u)

(5.14)

(5.15)

(5.16)

(5.17)

in order to relate this result to the gauge theory we need to decide what is the normal-

isation of the operator in the yang mills theory which couples to the perturbation. unlike

ads space, here there is considerable ambiguity in this matter. this issue was explored

in [6] for a massless scalar eld where it was found that a momentum dependent wave

function renormalisation needed to be done to extract sensible answers. a similar renor-
malisation is required here as well 10. we have not been able to implement a satisfactory

renormalisation scheme at the moment. the one which is most natural in the present con-

text corresponds to a momentum dependent wave function renormalisation and therefore

does not correpond to a choice of local counter terms. below we will choose a renormalised

operator whose one point function agrees at low momenta, and for a large instanton, with

expectations from the ordinary gauge theory. the perturbation (5.10) should couple to
the operator t rf 2 + t rf f at low momenta. now the function a2(k, a) behaves for low
momentum as:

a2(k, a) = c1(ka)4 +   
then consider the renormalised operator given by:

or(~k) =

u0g
5c1

e20
(ka2)3/2 o(~k)

(5.18)

(5.19)

10 this is clear if we consider a two point function of the perturbation above the background

geometry.

16

its expectation value from (5.17) is

< or(~k) >=


g

k2(1)

k (, u)

(5.20)

when au << 1 the function (1)
u2 k(k/u), and for (ka) << 1 we can replace
  2. then (5.20) reduces to exactly the answer for the one point function in the presence
of a d-instanton in ads5  s5 11. this is the fourier transformation of

k (, u)  1

< t rf 2(x) + t rf f (x) >=

48
g2
y m

( 1
u )4

[( 1
u )2 + |~x  ~x|]4

,

(5.21)

which is the prole of an instanton in ordinary yang-mills theory.

thus when the d-instanton is located deep in the bulk and we look at the long wave-

length modes of the solution, the parameter 1/u in (5.20) plays the role of the instanton

scale size as expected. it would be interesting to examine the departures from this low mo-

mentum behavior, as well as the predictions for the noncommutative yang-mills instantons

of small size.

5.4 operators in the gauge theory

in the usual ads  cf t correspondence, the dilaton  couples to the operator as

while the axion couples as

z etr(fijf ij)

z tr(fij f ij)

(5.22)

(5.23)

where f stands for the dual in the four dimensional sense. one might think that to get
the operators for noncommutative yang-mills theory one simply needs to replace ordinary
gauge elds f by nonocommutative gauge elds f and odrinary products by star products
in the above relations. however this cannot be correct. unlike in ordinary yang -mills the-
ory, objects like t r f  f are not gauge invariant though their integrals are 12. as a result,
while the operator tr fij  fkl can be coupled to supergravity elds which are constant
along the brane (as for example in the form of the action for noncommutative yang-mills),

one cannot couple them to nonconstant supergravity elds. however nontrivial eects of

noncommutativity appear when there is momentum along the brane directions.

11 this may be veried by writing the d-instanton solution as a momentum space integral using

the techniques of this paper and repeating the above calculation in that case.

12 s.t. acknowledges a discussion with a. hashimoto on this issue.

17

it is possible to write down gauge invariant operators order by order in the noncom-

mutavity parameter and couple supergravity elds, but one suspects that there must be a

more natural and simpler principle here. in a sense noncommutative gauge theories have

a nonabelian nature when elds are regarded to have their momenta as group indices.

thus the natural invariant objects are in fact integrals over the brane rather than local

quantities.

in any case, we believe that our supergravity results should act as a guide to the

correct coupling of noncommutative gauge eld with closed string elds.

in this appendix we give the necessary asymptotic forms of the solutions and various

quantities related to these solutions and compute the wronskian necessary for normaliza-

tion of the greens function.

the results of [13] may be used to obtain expressions for the various quantities dened

of particular interest is the small ka behavior of these quantities. these are

g = ga(ka)4 + o((ka)8)

where e1, f1, g1 are real numerical coecients of order one.

we will use these results to examine the low momentum components of the instanton

8.4. low energy limit of solutions

in the limit (ka) << 1 at xed (au) the solutions k go over to bessel functions as

well. this may be seen from the relation, valid for any w

for (ka) << 1 with xed w only the n = 0 term in the sum contributes, and we can also

set  = 2 in the leading order. we nally have, in this limit
