abstract

we discuss deformation quantization of the covariant, light-cone and con-
formal gauge-xed p-brane actions (p > 1) which are closely related to the
structure of the classical and quantum nambu brackets.
it is known that
deformation quantization of the nambu bracket is not of the usual moyal
type. yet the nambu bracket can be quantized using the zariski deformation
quantization (discovered by dito, flato, sternheimer and takhtajan) which
is based on factorization of polynomials in several real variables. we discuss
a particular application of the zariski deformed quantization in m-theory
by considering the problem of a covariant formulation of matrix theory. we
propose that the problem of a covariant formulation of matrix theory can be
solved using the formalism of zariski deformation quantization of the triple
nambu bracket.

1 introduction

even though a fully background independent non-perturbative formulation
of m/string theory is still largely mysterious, some notable progress toward
a background dependent formulation of m/string theory has been recently
made. at the moment, perhaps the most promising background dependent
formulations of m/string theory are matrix theory [1] and ads/cft duality
[2]. the two approaches appear to be intimately related, as pointed out in
[3].

both formulations suggest a duality between maximally supersymmetric
yang-mills theory (or appropriate conformally invariant eld theory) and
supergravity in a particular background. however, the underlying physical
reason for such a duality is not fully understood. the at space-time limit
of this duality appears particularly puzzling at present.

it has also been recently uncovered [4] that string and light-cone m-theory
in the background of b elds, taken in appropriate limits, are described by
supersymmetric yang-mills theory on a non-commutative space. this non-
commutative yang-mills theory is formulated using the moyal bracket, a
structure essential in the deformation quantization of the poisson brackets.
in this article we suggest that a dierent kind of deformation quantization
- called zariski deformation quantization [5] - is the relevant mathematical
structure for the formulation of a covariant matrix theory.

we motivate our presentation by a discussion of deformation quantiza-
tion of the covariant, light-cone and conformal gauge-xed p-brane actions
[6], [7], [8], [9] which are closely related to the structure of the classical and
quantum nambu brackets [10], [11], [12]. it turns out that deformation quan-
tization of nambu brackets is not of the usual moyal type. as shown by dito,
flato, sternheimer and takhtajan [5] the nambu bracket can be quantized
using the zariski deformation quantization which is based on factorization of
polynomials in several real variables.

in view of this fact we discuss the application of the zariski deformed

quantization to the problem of a covariant formulation of matrix theory.

the paper is organized as follows: rst, in section 2. we briey review
the connection between nambu brackets and the covariant, light-cone and
conformal gauge-xed p-brane actions. then in section 3. we discuss the
fundamental properties of the classical nambu bracket and the zariski de-
formation quantization of the same. then in section 4. we apply the results

1

of section 3. to the problem of covariantization of matrix theory in terms
of the deformed zariski product. in this section we state a precise proposal
toward a covariant formulation of matrix theory. in section 5. we compare
the construction of quantum nambu brackets in terms of square and cubic
matrices [13] to the zariski deformation quantization scheme and discuss a
natural mathematical formulation of the space-time uncertainty principle of
m-theory [14] in view of our proposal.

2 p-branes and the nambu bracket

in this section we review the relation between the various forms of the bosonic
p-brane actions (p > 1) and the classical nambu bracket. let us start from
the familiar covariant bosonic p-brane action [6]

where g = detgij and the induced world-volume metric gij is

s = z dp+1g,

(1)

gij = ixjx.

(2)
here x( = 0, 1, ..., d) denote the target space coordinates of a d + 1 dimen-
sional bosonic p-brane. xs are functions of p + 1 world-volume coordinates
i, i = 0, 1, .., p. the equation of motion for x follows from (1):

the covariant p-brane action is reparametrization invariant

i(ggijjx) = 0.

x = iix.

(3)

(4)

the world-volume reparametrization invariance allows us to choose dierent
gauges: we discuss the light-cone and conformal gauges in what follows,
because of their relation to the structure of the classical nambu bracket.

2.1 volume preserving dieormorphisms and the clas-

sical nambu bracket

the light-cone gauge variables are denoted by xa (a = 1, ..., d  1) . the
light-cone coordinates are dened as
1
2

(xd  x0),

x =

(5)

2

where in the light-cone gauge

ix+  p+i0.

the world volume coordinates i split as

the light-cone bosonic p-brane action is [6]

(0, s)  (t, s).

slc = 1/2z dp+1((d0xa)2  h),

(6)

(7)

(8)

where h  det grs (r, s = 1, 2, .., p) is the determinant of the induced p-
dimensional metric and the covariant derivative

d0xa = (0 + uss)xa.

note that the equations of motion imply

sus = 0.

(9)

(10)

also, h  det grs (r, s = 1, 2, .., p) is determined by the following expression
(11)

h = (1/p!){xa1, xa2, ..., xap}2.

the symbol {f, g, ...w} denotes the classical nambu bracket [10] with respect
to s
(12)

{f, g, ..., w}  ij..kif j g...kw,

where f, g, ...w denote functions of s. thus the light-cone bosonic p-brane
action can be rewritten as follows

slc = 1/2z dp+1((d0xa)2  (1/p!){xa1, xa2, ..., xap}2).

(13)

the original world-volume dieomorphisms x = iix reduce in the light-
cone gauge to the p-dimensional volume preserving dieomorphisms described
by the action of the classical nambu bracket (see section 3. for details)

xa = {u, v, ..., xa}.

(14)

the longitudinal coordinate x is determined from the primary constraint
parxa +p+rx  0 and the requirement, implied by the equation of motion,
that the longitudinal momentum is time-independent 0p+ = 0.

3

2.2 conformal dieomorphisms

the conformal gauge is dened as follows [9]

g00 = h,

g0a = 0,

gab = hab.

(15)

if a = 1 we get the usual conformal gauge of perturbative string theory.

the parameters 0 and a from the equation x = iix satisfy the

following relations

00 = aa,

0a = hhabb0.

the conformal gauge action is [9]

sc = 1/2z dp+1((0x)2  (1/p!){x1, ..., xp}2).

(16)

(17)

note the similarity between the structures of slc and sc. the obvious dier-
ence is that the form of sc is covariant with respect to target space indices,
unlike the form of slc.

this action is invariant under x = iix with 0 and a given above.

one can also check that the constraints

t00 = 1/2(0x)2 + 1/(2p!){x1, ..., xp}2  0
t0a = 0xax  0
transform into each other under this residual symmetry [9].

(18)

2.3 discretization of p-branes and the quantum nambu

bracket

given the expressions for s, slc and sc there obviously exists a natural rela-
tion between the structure of the classical nambu bracket and the covariant,
light-cone and conformal gauge-xed p-brane actions. thus, by quantizing
the p-dimensional nambu bracket we can naturally discretize either covariant
or light-cone or conformal p-brane action.

what do we mean by discretize? recall that the light-cone membrane
action (p=2) can be regularized (or discretized) by applying the goldstone-
hoppe map between representation theories of the algebra of the area pre-
serving dieomorphisms (apd) and the n =  limit of lie algebras [7], [8].

4

in particular, the goldstone-hoppe prescription instructs us to perform the
following translation of the transverse spatial coordinates

{xa, xb}  [x a, x b],

(19)

where now x a denote large n n hermitian matrices. moreover, integration
is translated into tracing

z d1d2...  t r.

(20)

this dictionary translates the light-cone membrane action [7], [8] into the
action of matrix theory [1].

the obvious generalization of this prescription for the case of p-branes is

[13], [15]

{xb1, xb2, ..., xbl}  [x b1, x b2, ..., x bl],

(21)

where for the moment the nature of x bk is not precisely dened (see sections
3. and 4.). note that in this prescription index b is either the transverse space
index a in the light-cone gauge, or the covariant index  in the conformal
gauge; in both cases l = p. the object on the right-hand side is what we call
the quantum nambu bracket (see section 3. for a precise denition). also in
this case

z d1d2...dp+1  t r

(22)

where t r is a suitable generalization of the operation of tracing.

given the expressions for the light-cone and conformal gauge-xed p-
brane actions, we can obviously apply this dictionary. the classical nambu
bracket in the expressions for slc and sc is replaced by its quantum counter-
part and integration by tracing.

the covariant p-brane action is of course also invariant under the sub-
group of world-volume dieomorphism. the covariant action s can be rewrit-
ten as

s = z dp+1qdetgij = z dp+1s 1

(p + 1)!{xa1, xa2, ..., xap+1}2,

or equivalently, in the polynomial form

s = 1/2z dp+1(

1

(p + 1)!e{xa1, xa2, ..., xap+1}2  e).

(23)

(24)

5

therefore the above dictionary can be directly applied at the level of the
covariant action (with b denoting the covariant index  and l = p + 1). this
procedure gives an appropriately discretized version of the covariant p-brane
action. we will use this formal observation when we discuss the issue of
covariantization of matrix theory in section 4.

note that the volume preserving dieomorphisms are not related to the
gauge transformations of the yang-mills type. in fact it was conjectured in
[6] that p-dimensional volume preserving dieomorphisms are related to an
innite-dimensional non-abelian antisymmetric tensor gauge theory.

in order to explore these non-yang-mills transformations it is natural
to study the discretization of p-branes by quantizing the nambu bracket.
the solution to the quantization problem is given by the zariski deformation
quantization discovered in [5] which we discuss in the next section.

3 deformation quantization and the nambu

bracket

for simplicity, in this section we consider only the triple nambu bracket.
our treatment can be easily extended to the general case.

3.1 classical nambu bracket

we start this section with a short review of the fundamental properties of the
classical nambu bracket following [13]. consider a three-dimensional space
parametrized by {xi}. the three-dimensional volume preserving dieomor-
phisms (vpd) on this space are described by a dierentiable map

xi  yi(x)

such that

where, by denition, as in section 2.

{y1, y2, y3} = 1

{a, b, c}  ijkiajbkc

(25)

(26)

(27)

is the nambu-poisson bracket, or nambu bracket, or nambu triple bracket,
which satises [5], [12], [16], [17]

6

1. skew-symmetry

{a1, a2, a3} = (1)(p){ap(1), ap(2), ap(3)},

(28)

where p(i) is the permutation of indices and (p) is the parity of the
permutation,

2. derivation

{a1a2, a3, a4} = a1{a2, a3, a4} + {a1, a3, a4}a2,

(29)

3. fundamental identity (fi-1) [12], [17]

{{a1, a2, a3}, a4, a5} + {a3,{a1, a2, a4}, a5}
+{a3, a4,{a1, a2, a5}} = {a1, a2,{a3, a4, a5}}.

(30)

the three-dimensional vpd involve two independent functions. let these
functions be denoted by f and g. the innitesimal three-dimensional vpd
generator is then given as

d(f, g)  ijkif jgk
 dk(f, g)k.

the volume-preserving property is nothing but the identity

idi(f, g) = k(ijkif jg) = 0.

(31)
(32)

(33)

given an arbitrary scalar function x(xi), the three-dimensional vpd act as

d(f, g)x = {f, g, x}.

(34)

apart from the issue of global denition of the functions f and g, we can
represent an arbitrary innitesimal volume-preserving dieomorphism in this
form.

on the other hand, if the base three-dimensional space {xi} is mapped
into a target space of dimension d + 1 whose coordinates are x  ( =
0, 1, 2, . . . , d), the induced innitesimal volume element is

d  q{x , x , x }2dx1dx2dx3,

7

(35)

provided the target space is a at euclidean space. the volume element is
of course invariant under the general three-dimensional dieomorphisms.

the triple product {x , x , x } is also invariant under the vpd. more

precisely, it transforms as a scalar. namely,

{y , y , y }  {x , x , x } = d(f, g){x , x , x } + o(2)

for

y = x + d(f, g)x.

(36)

(37)

this is due to the the fundamental identity fi-1 which shows that the oper-
ator d(f, g) acts as a derivation within the nambu bracket. for xed f and
g, we can dene a nite transformation by

x(t)  exp(td(f, g))  x =



xn=0

tn
n!{f, g,{f, g,{. . . ,{f, g,{f, g, x}} . . . ,}}}
(38)

which satises the nambu equation of motion [10]

d
dt

x(t) = {f, g, x(t)}.

(39)

the nambu-poisson structure is preserved under this evolution equation.

notice that in the case of the usual poisson structure, the algebra of

two-dimensional area preserving dieomorphisms is given by

where

[d(f1), d(f2)] = d(f3)

f3 = {f1, f2}

d(f )x = {f, x}.

(40)

(41)

(42)

it turns out that the three-dimensional analogue of the commutator algebra
[13]

can be written using the quantum triple nambu commutator [10]

d(a[1)d(a2]) = d({a1, a2})

[a, b, c]n  abc  acb + bca  bac + cab  cba

(43)

(44)

8

as follows

or equivalently

d(a[1, a2)d(a3]n , b) = 2d({a1, a2, a3}, b),

(45)

d(b[1, b2)d(a[1, a2)d(a3]n , b3]n ) = 4d({a1, a2, a3},{b1, b2, b3}). (46)
both relations are equivalent to the fundamental identity

{a1, a2,{a3, b, c}} + {a2, a3,{a1, b, c}} + {a3, a1,{a2, b, c}}

= {{a1, a2, a3}, b, c}

.(47)

this result suggests that there is a new kind of symmetry based on a new
composition law whose innitesimal algebra is given by the triple commutator
(44). it was conjectured in [13] that this symmetry is related to the gauge
transformations that are not of the yang-mills type [6].

3.2 deformation quantization of the nambu bracket

armed with this background we are ready to discuss the deformation quan-
tization of the nambu bracket.

the basic philosophy of deformation quantization [18] is to view quan-
tization as the procedure of replacing the algebra of observables in classical
mechanics, such as functions dened over classical phase space, with the
usual product of functions, by the algebra dened by a deformed product of
functions (called star or moyal product).

the moyal (star) product [18] of two functions on a 2-dimensional phase
space (q, p) is dened as a deformation of the ordinary product of functions

(f  g)(q, p) = exp[ih/2(qp  pq)](f, g)  exp[ih/2p](f, g)

(48)

and is known to be associative

the moyal bracket is dened as

(f  g)  h = f  (g  h).

{{f, g}} 

1
ih

(f  g  g  f ).

9

(49)

(50)

the properties of the moyal bracket are the same as the properties of the
poisson bracket or the commutator of operators in quantum mechanics. this
enables one in principle to perform quantum-mechanical calculations within
the classical framework without using hilber-space formalism. there are
other formal advantages of this viewpoint.

for example, the feyman path integral can be viewed as the fourier
transform over the momentum variable p of exp(ith/h)(q, p) [19] where
(51)

exp(f )(q, p) = 1 + f (q, p) + 1/2!(f  f )(q, p) + ...

in the symplectic case the star product is given by the feynman path inte-
gral. the general solution for the deformation quantization of the algebra of
functions on a poisson manifold, as formulated by kontsevich [20], can also
be understood from this point of view.

it is interesting that the same set-up of moyal deformation quantization
does not work for the nambu bracket. the basic obstruction is provided by
the property of the fundamental identity.

for example, the exponentiated nambu bracket

[f1, f2, f3]h 

1

6 xp

(p)(fp1, fp2, fp3)h

where the deformed product is dened as

(f1, f2, f3)h = exp[ih/2({x, y, z})](f1, f2, f3)

(52)

(53)

does not satisfy the property of the fundamental identity of the classical
nambu bracket [5].

the solution of the deformation quantization problem is rather non-trivial
in this situation and has been discovered in [5]. the solution involves the
zariski product which is based on the factorization of polynomials in several
real variables.

before describing the formalism we have to specify what we mean by a
quantum triple nambu bracket. in general we want an object [f, g, w ] which
satises the properties analogous to the classical nambu bracket {f, g, w} as
listed in the previous section. (here f, g, w are functions of three variables,
and the nature of f, g, w is left open for the moment.) thus [f, g, w ] is
expected to satisfy [5], [12], [16], [17]

10

1. skew-symmetry

[a1, a2, a3] = (1)(p)[ap(1), ap(2), ap(3)],

(54)

where again p(i) is the permutation of indices and (p) is the parity of
the permutation,

2. derivation

[a1a2, a3, a4] = a1[a2, a3, a4] + [a1, a3, a4]a2,

(55)

3. fundamental identity (f.i.)

[[a1, a2, a3], a4, a5] + [a3, [a1, a2, a4], a5]
+[a3, a4, [a1, a2, a5]] = [a1, a2, [a3, a4, a5]].

(56)

(note that the two-dimensional quantum nambu bracket which satises
above properties is just the usual commutator of matrices [a, b]  abbc.
in this case the f.i. reduces to the jacobi identity.)
now we describe the zariski quantization scheme following the original

work of [5].

the basic idea of [5] is to replace the usual product of functions in the clas-
sical nambu bracket which is abelian, associative, distributive and respects
the leibnitz rule, by another (deformed) product with the same properties.
then the modied nambu bracket dened by such a product will satisfy the
same properties of the classical nambu bracket.

the construction is based on a couple of preliminary denitions [5]:
1) let n irr be the set of real irreducible normalized polynomials of three
variables x1, x2, x3. let z0 be a real vector space having a basis indexed by
products of elements of n irr. denote the basis of z0 by zu1...um where u1...um
are elements of n irr. the vector space z0 becomes an algebra by dening a
product 

zu1...um  zv1...un = zu1...umv1...vn

(57)

called the zariski product.

let zh be the vector space of polynomials in h (the deformation param-

eter) with coecients in z0. then let

(xr

hrur) = xr

hrzur.

11

(58)

the deformed zariski product is dened as

zu1...um h zv1...un = ((u1, ...um)  (v1...vn))

(59)

where the operation  for two irreducible polynomials u1 and v1 is given
by the folowing formula

u1  v1 =

1
2

(u1  v1 + v1  u1)

(60)

and where  is the usual moyal product with respect to two variables x1 and
x2. in general, one has to fully symmetrize the  product of irreducible poly-
nomials. also, the deformed product is extended from z0 to zh by requiring
that it annihilates the non-zero powers of the deformation parameter.

2) let e = z0[y1, y2, y3] be the algebra of polynomials in three variables
y1, y2, y3 with coecients in z0. let a0 be a subalgebra of e generated by
the following taylor series in e

1

2 xi,j

yiziu +

j(zu) = zu +xi
where izu  ziu and u are normalized polynomials in three variables
x1, x2, x3 that can be uniquely factorized in u1, ..., um, and i is a deriva-
tive with respect to xi. dene the following generalized derivative

yiyjzij u + ...  xn

yii)n(zu)

1
n!

(xi

(61)

a(j(zu))  j(zau)

where a = 1, 2, 3.

then the classical nambu bracket on a0 is dened as [5]

[a, b, c] = xp

(p)p1a  p2b  p3c

(62)

(63)

for three elements a, b, c from a0.

it can be shown [5] that there exists a deformation of this nambu bracket

in the sense of deformation quantization.

let eh be the algebra of polynomials of h (the deformation parameter)
with coecients in e dened above. consider a subspace ah of eh consisting
of polynomials in h with coecients in a0. then the authors of [5] dene a
deformed product

j(zu) h j(zv) = zu h zv +xi

yi(ziu h zu + zu h ziuzu) + ...

(64)

12

where the deformed zariski product of basis elements is dened as before.

then one can dene the quantum nambu bracket on ah as follows

[a, b, c]h = xp

(p)p1a h p2b h p3c

(65)

for three elements a, b, c from ah.

it can be shown [5] that this quantum nambu bracket satises all three
fundamental properties: it is totally antisymmetric, it satises the derivation
property and the fundamental identity.

therefore, this construction solves the quantization problem.
obviously the same construction can be applied to the usual poisson
bracket. in that case the zariski quantized poisson bracket is not the skew-
symmetrized form of an associative (star) product.

nevertheless, one can dene a moyal-zariski product by replacing [5]

exp[ih/2p]  exp[ih/2ph]

(66)

in the dening formula for the moyal bracket. this procedure gives an-
other associative deformation of the usual product of functions. the skew-
symmetrized form of this associative deformed product will provide a lie
algebra deformation. note that the leading term in the expansion of such a
bracket is given by the zariski quantized poisson bracket!

this fact is of crucial importance for our proposal concerning the link
between covariant matrix theory and zariski deformation quantization (see
next section).

we conclude this section with the following comment:
the star product relevant for the general deformation quantization of the
poisson bracket, as discovered by kontsevich, can be understood from the
path integral point of view [20]. it is natural to ask whether the star product
(such as the deformed zariski product) relevant for the quantization of the
triple nambu bracket can be understood from the path integral point of view.
one obvious idea that comes to mind is that such a path integral has to be
over loop variables, which appear naturally in the hamiltonian formulation
of the nambu mechanics [12].

13

4 covariant matrix theory and zariski quan-

tization

in this section we propose that the problem of covariantization of matrix
theory can be solved using the formalism of zariski quantization.

recall that matrix theory [1] uses n  n hermitian matrices to represent
the transverse coordinates (and their super-partners) of n d0-branes in the
(discretized) light-cone frame x i
(i = 1, 2, . . . , 9). the statistics of d0-
branes are encoded in the u(n) gauge symmetry (t = x + =light-cone time)
x i  ux iu 1. the number n of d0-branes is connected to the longitudinal
momentum p + in the light-like direction by p + = n
r where r = gss is the
compactied radius in the x  direction. also  = l3
p/r, where lp is the
11-dimensional planck length.

what should be the structure of a covariant matrix theory? we expect

at least

1. generalization of the matrix algebra and the emergence of higher sym-

metry

2. r (and perhaps n) should appear as dynamical variables.

at present, the only guiding principle in trying to search for such a formu-
lation is that the formalism should reduce in the light-cone gauge to matrix
theory after appropriately xing the gauge using the higher symmetry, and
that it should have 11-dimensional (super) poincare invariance in the limit
r  .
the light-cone degrees of freedom (d0-branes) carry the quantum num-
ber of 11-dimensional (super)gravitons. thus we expect that the covariant
version of matrix theory will describe a many-body quantum theory of in-
teracting 11-dimensional (super)gravitons.

the covariant theory is also expected to be a quantum mechanical theory
invariant under world-line reparametrizations, simply because in the light-
cone gauge we have a quantum mechanical theory with a globally dened
time.

of course it is tempting to try to quantize the world-volume membrane
theory for which we know a classical covariant action principle in view of
the results in sections 2. in particular, as we have explicitly said in section

14

2., the expression for the world volume of a membrane is invariant under
the classical 3d volume preserving dieomorphisms. thus it is natural to
expect that a discretized membrane theory should be formulated in terms of
discretized volume preserving dieomorphisms. (a preliminary attempt at
discretization of the world-volume membrane theory was reported in [21].)

this idea appears natural as a generalization of the following pictorial

correspondence

matrices/commutators  2d surface
 2d apd

u(n)



triple nambu bracket  3d volume
 3d dieos

?

since the two indices of the square matrices in matrix theory just correspond
to the discretized fourier indices on the membrane.

in the following we propose a precise algebraic structure that replaces the

question mark in the above diagram.

4.1 the proposal

here we state a concrete proposal for the covariantization of matrix the-
ory. for simplicity, we discuss the bosonic part only. our proposal can be
extended to include maximal supersymmetry.

we propose that the following action denes a covariant matrix theory

sm = z d3s 1

6

[x , x , x ]2

 1
n

.

(67)

here  = 0, 1, ..., 10 and x  are elements of a 1
as dened in section 3. -
in other words they are polynomials in 1/n with coecients in a0 (recall
that a0 is the algebra of shifted polynomials of three variables, in this
case, 1, 2, 3). we take 1/n to be the deformation parameter of the zariski
quantization.

n is interpreted as the number of 11-dimensional (super)gravitons.

15

the action sm is invariant under zariski deformed world-volume dieo-

ix , with  from section 3.

n

due to the usual properties of the product  1

morphisms x  = i  1
(recall that the deformed
product is abelian, associative and distributive and the formal derivative a
respects linearity, the leibnitz rule and the commutativity of the derivatives
in many variables) we can formally repeat the same steps of xing the light-
cone gauge for this theory, as in section 2.

n

thus, the light cone action is given by a zariski deformed version of
the usual-light cone action for the m-theory membrane, with a deformation
parameter 1/n

slc = 1/2z d3((0x a)2  (1/2)[x a, x b]2

 1
n

).

(68)

now we use the crucial observation from section 3. the skew-symmetrized
form of the moyal-zariski associative deformed product provides a lie algebra
deformation, and is thus in the same class as the commutator of matrices.
moreover, the leading term (in n) in the expansion of such a bracket is given
by the zariski quantized poisson bracket.

in view of this fact, it is natural to propose that this zariski deformed
light-cone action is in the same universality class as the matrix theory action
[1], where n is the number of d0-branes.

thus the above covariant action can be viewed as a description of a
large n quantum mechanical theory of n interacting 11-dimensional (su-
per)gravitons.

notice that our proposal can be formulated for the polyakov type action
as well, due to the properties of the deformed zariski product. because of
the usual properties of the deformed product  1
it is possible to formulate
our proposal for the supersymmetric case as well.

n

finally we comment on the n   limit of our proposal.
the n   of the action sm reduces to the bosonic part of the usual m-
theory membrane action with space-time coordinates x being the elements of
the algebra a0, where  denes the two product and  the formal derivation
with respect to the world-volume coordinates . if our proposal is correct this
n   limit theory should be in the same universality class as the ordinary
bosonic membrane [7]. the same comments apply to the supersymmetric
case.

16

as in matrix theory, the membrane is just one sector of the theory. other

physical sectors should exist as well.

we conclude this subsection with a list of a few obvious questions:
- is there an explicit matrix version of our conjecture ?
- what is the physical interpretation of anti-branes in our proposal?
- does our proposal include the m-theory ve-brane in the large n limit?
at present we do not have denitive answers to these important questions,

so we postpone their discussion for the future.

5 discussion

in this, concluding section, we compare the construction of quantum nambu
brackets in terms of square and cubic matrices [13] to the zariski deformation
quantization scheme and discuss a natural mathematical formulation of the
space-time uncertainty principle of m-theory [14] in view of our proposal.

5.1 square and cubic matrices vs. zariski quantiza-

tion

an explicit matrix realization of the quantum nambu bracket, which is skew-
symmetric and obeys the fundamental identity was given in [13]. this real-
ization was contrasted to the example constructed in [16].

dene a totally antisymmetric triple bracket of three matrices a, b, c as

[a, b, c]  (tra)[b, c] + (trb)[c, a] + (trc)[a, b].

(69)

then tr[a, b, c] = 0, and if c = 1, [a, b, 1] = n[a, b], where n is the rank
of square matrices. this bracket is obviously skew-symmetric and it can be
shown to obey the fundamental identity [13].

given this example of a three-dimensional quantum nambu bracket, con-

sider the following gauge transformation

a  i[x, y, a],

(70)

where the factor i is introduced for hermitian matrices. this transforma-
tion represents an obvious quantum form of the three-dimensional volume

17

preserving dieomorphisms. by the denition of the triple bracket, the gen-
eralized gauge transformation takes the following explicit form

a = i ([(trx)y  (try )x, a] + (tra)[x, y ]) .

it is shown in [13] that if trai = 0, i = 1, ...n, then

tr(a1a2 . . . an)

(71)

(72)

is gauge invariant. note that the gauge transformation of a commutator does
not satisfy the usual composition rule, namely

[x, y, [a, b]] 6= [[x, y, a], b] + [a, [x, y, b]].

similar comments apply to [[x i, x j], [x l, x k]].

notice that the form of the gauge transformation (71) indicates that a
bosonic hermitian matrix a can be transformed into a form proportional to
the unit n  n matrix as long as tra 6= 0. in other words, since the gauge
transformation is traceless, one can show that a hermitian matrix can be
brought to the following form

a 

1
n

tra1n .

this matrix realization of the triple quantum nambu bracket can be gen-
eralized to a representation in terms of three-index objects or cubic matrices
[13].

to this end, introduce the following generalization of the trace

apmp,

habi  xpqm

apmqbqmp,

hai  xpm
(73)
which satisfy habi = hbai and habci = hbcai = hcabi. furthermore,
dene a triple-product

habci  xpqrm

apmqbqmrcrmp,

(abc)ijk  xp

aijphbicpjk = xpqm

aijpbqmqcpjk.

(74)

and the following skew-symmetric quantum nambu bracket

[a, b, c]  (abc) + (bca) + (cab)  (cba)  (acb)  (bac). (75)

18

the middle index j of aijk can be treated as an internal index for the matrix
realization of the triple quantum nambu bracket. note also that h(abc)i =
hbihaci 6= habci and h(abc)di = hbihacdi.

then by using the following relations

((abc)de) = ((adc)be) = (ab(cde)) = (ad(cbe)),
(a(bcd)e) = (a(dcb)e),

(76)

one can directly prove that the skew-symmetric nambu bracket (75) with
the triple-product (74) obeys the fundamental identity [13].

the trace habi has the property

h [x, y, a]b i + h a[x, y, b]i = 0,

provided hai = hbi = 0. therefore, since h [a, b, c]i = 0 for any three-
index objects a, b and c, the trace of the product of nambu brackets
h [a, b, c][d, e, f ]i is gauge invariant. notice that if one generalizes the
trace (73) as

ha1a2    ani  xp1,p2,,m

a1

p1mp2a2

p2mp3    an

pnmp1,

n = 1, 2,   ,

(77)

one can also demonstrate that the trace of any product of nambu brackets
h [a, b, c][d, e, f ]   [x, y, z]i is gauge invariant [13].
for any j. then

ik = 0, if i 6= k, for any j and (j)

dene iijk  (j)

ik , where (j)

ik = 1, if i = k,

aijpbpjk,

(aib) = hiixp

(iai) = hai(j)
ik ,

(iab) = (bai) = haib,
(iia) = (aii) = hiia,

(78)

and [a, i, b] = pp(aijpbpjk  bijpapjk). hence for any middle index j,
[a, i, b] reduces to the usual commutator [a(j), b(j)] for the matrices a(j)
ik 
aijk and b(j)
other examples of triple-products (abc)ijk which also satisfy the same
relations as eq. (76) and hence lead to the f.i. for the skew-symmetric nambu
bracket (75) were listed in [13]

ik  bijk.

the explicit examples of the quantum nambu bracket presented above
do not satisfy the derivation property. also, the form of the above quantum
nambu brackets does not completely parallel the form of the classical nambu
bracket.

the classical triple nambu bracket of three functions f, g, h of three vari-

ables , 1, 2 can be obviously rewritten as

{f, g, w} = f{g, w} + g{w, f} + w{f, g}

(80)

where f =  f and {f, g} = 1f 2g  2f 1g.
bracket in terms of  -dependent square matrices to

if we try to extrapolate our previous denition of the quantum nambu

[f, g, w ] = f [g, w ] + g[w, f ] + w [f, g]

(81)

where f =  f and the usual matrix multiplication is assumed, one can
show that such [f, g, w ] does not satisfy the fundamental identity 2. from
the analogy with the covariant membrane and our discussion in section 4.,
we interpret  as a potential world-line parameter.

obviously the zariski deformation quantization provides us with a quan-
tum nambu bracket which has the same properties as its classical counter-
part and therefore can be used for the discretization of p-brane actions as
discussed in subsection 2.3. that is why our proposal toward a covariant
formulation of matrix theory from section 4. was formulated in terms of the
algebraic structures needed in the zariski deformation quantization.

it is not clear at present whether the zariski deformation quantization
has an explicit representation in terms of matrices (either square or cubic).

5.2 space-time uncertainty relation in m-theory

the main signature of the space-time uncertainty relation [14] is the oppo-
site scaling of the transverse and longitudinal directions with respect to the
fundamental string (in perturbative string theory) or with respect to a dp-
brane in non-perturbative string/m theory (see also [22]). in perturbative
string theory the space-time uncertainty relation incorporates the eects of
conformal symmetry. in non-perturbative string/m theory, the space-time

2this was explicitly shown by h. awata - private communication.

20

uncertainty relation captures the essential features of the physics of d-branes
as well as the property of holographic behavior [23]. thus it is reasonable
to expect that the space-time uncertainty relation says something important
about the underlying physical foundation of m-theory. here we want to com-
ment on the mathematical structure underlying the space-time uncertainty
relation in view of our proposal from section 4.

perhaps the simplest way of characterizing the space-time uncertainty

relation is by writing

(82)

(83)

where t and x measure the eective longitudinal (along the world-volume
of a p-brane) and transverse space-time distances. this equation is true in
matrix theory [1]

t x  ,

x a  x a, t  1t,

provided the longitudinal distance is identied with the global time of matrix
theory. the eective super yang-mills theory which describes the dynam-
ics of d0-branes is invariant under (83) if the string coupling constant is
simultaneously rescaled

gs  3gs.

(84)

the space-time uncertainty relation leads readily to the well known charac-
teristic space-time scales in m-theory [14]. note that eq. (83) can also be
applied to dp-branes, provided

gs  3pgs.

(85)

what is the natural mathematical set-up for the space-time uncertainty
relation in string theory (82)? it was proposed by yoneya and li and yoneya
[14] that the right point of view for discussing the space-time uncertainty
principle in string theory, is to treat all space-time coordinates as innite
dimensional matrices.

remarkably, the string theory space-time uncertainty relation can be un-
derstood as a limit of the space-time uncertainty relation in m-theory as
noticed by li and yoneya [14]. in matrix theory eq.(82) can be rewritten as

t xt  l3

p/r,

(86)

where xt and t respectively measure transverse spatial and time direc-
tions.

21

li and yoneya have proposed a more general relation [14] by observing
that the uncertainty for the longitudinal direction in physical processes that
involve individual d0-branes is xl  r. then (86) reads

t xt xl  l3
p.

(87)

this is the space-time uncertainty relation in m-theory. note that only the
fundamental length scale of m-theory (lp) gures in this relation.

the point we want to make is that the form of the space-time uncertainty
relation in m-theory is very reminiscent of the form of the quantum triple
nambu bracket we have discussed in the previous section [13]. in particular
it is natural to extend the proposal of yoneya and li and yoneya [14] for
the case of matrix theory, and suggest a covariant version of the space-time
uncertainty relation in matrix theory which is consistent with (87)

[x , x , x ]2

n  l6

p

(88)

here , ,  = 0, 1, ..., 10. the triple bracket in the above formula is the quan-
tum triple nambu bracket in the sense of zariski deformation quantization
with the deformation parameter 1
as in the
previous section.

n and x s are elements of a 1

n

in view of the relation between the space-time uncertainty principle [14]
and the uv/ir relation [22] and the holographic principle [23] it is natural
to expect that this mathematical formulation of the space-time uncertainty
principle captures the mathematical content of the holographic principle in
the at space-time limit.
