abstract

the spectrum of open strings on various non-bps d-brane congurations in type ii
string theory on a k3 orbifold is analysed. at a generic point in the corresponding moduli
space the spectrum of open strings does not have any degeneracy between bosonic and
fermionic states. however, there exist special values for these moduli for which many non-
bps d-brane congurations have an exactly bose-fermi degenerate open string spectrum
at all mass levels. in this case the closed string exchange interaction between a pair of
such d-brane congurations vanishes at all distances.

introduction and summary

bps d-branes carrying identical charges do not exert any force on each other, and can
be at equilibrium at all distances. this is a consequence of supersymmetry, and reects

the fact that the spectrum of open strings living on the world volume of the system has
exact degeneracy between bosonic and fermionic states at all mass levels. as a result the

partition function of the open strings, which corresponds to the negative of the interaction
energy of the pair of d-branes, vanishes identically.

if we consider a set of non-bps d-branes, or a system of bps d-branes carrying
dierent sets of charges and/or with dierent orientations so that the combined system
is not supersymmetric, then in general the spectrum of open strings will not have exact

bose-fermi degeneracy. the open string partition function, and hence the interaction
energy of the d-branes, is then not zero. in this case the d-branes exert a force on each

other, and the system is not in equilibrium.

in this paper we analyse explicitly the partition function of open strings for various

non-supersymmetric systems of d-branes in type iia/iib string theory on an orbifold k3.
we nd that in general this partition function does not vanish and that it has non-trivial

dependence on the relative distance between the branes. however, we also nd that as
we vary the moduli of the k3 orbifold, the open string spectrum can develop exact bose-
fermi degeneracy at some special points in the moduli space. for such congurations the

2

partition function vanishes identically, and to one loop in open string theory, the d-branes
do not exert any force on each other. our examples contain pairs of non-bps d-branes, as

well as a system of bps branes carrying dierent charge quantum numbers or orientations
so that the combined system is not supersymmetric.

the various examples that we shall examine involve either bps d-branes of type

iia/iib string theories wrapped on non-supersymmetric cycles of the k3 orbifold [1, 2],
or a system of bps d-branes each wrapped on a supersymmetric cycle [3], but such
that the combined system breaks all supersymmetries.1 a bps d-brane wrapped on a
supersymmetric cycle is obtained by starting with a bps d-brane in type iia/iib string
theory on a torus t 4, where an even number of tangential directions of the brane are
along the torus. this conguration is then modded out by a zz2 transformation generated
by i4, the transformation that reverses the sign of all the coordinates of t 4 [3]. on the
other hand, a bps d-brane wrapped on a non-supersymmetric cycle of k3 is obtained
by starting with a non-bps d-brane in type iia/iib string theory on t 4, where an odd
number of tangential directions of the brane are along the torus; this is then modded out
by the same zz2 transformation i4. for our analysis we shall use a t-dual description
which maps the orbifold of type iia/iib on t 4 by i4 to the orbifold of type iib/iia on t 4
by g = i4  (1)fl, where fl denotes the contribution to the space-time fermion number
from the left-moving sector of the world-sheet. in this description, the t-dual of a bps
d-brane wrapped on a supersymmetric cycle of k3 is obtained by taking a bps d-brane
on t 4 with an odd number of tangential directions along the torus and then modding
out the theory by g. on the other hand the t-dual of a bps d-brane wrapped on a
non-supersymmetric cycle of k3 is obtained by taking a non-bps d-brane with an even

number of tangential directions along the torus, and then modding out the theory by g.
in all the examples that we discuss we take t 4 to be a direct product of four circles with
no background anti-symmetric tensor eld.

the rst example that we shall consider is that of a single non-bps dp brane of
iib/iia situated at one of the orbifold xed points of t 4/g, all of whose tangential
directions extend along the non-compact space-time. (in the dual type iia/iib theory
on k3 this corresponds to a bps (p + 2)-brane wrapped on a non-supersymmetric 2-cycle

of k3.) this system is stable when the radius of each circle of the torus is larger than

1a simpler example of a bose-fermi degenerate spectrum on a non-bps brane conguration involving

a combination of a 9-brane and a 5-brane has been recently discussed in [4].

3

(1/2).2 we nd that precisely when all the four radii are at their critical value, the
spectrum of open strings living on the system develops exact bose-fermi degeneracy, and

thus the one loop open string partition function vanishes. this implies that to this order,
the force between a pair of branes of this type due to closed string exchange vanishes at
all distance scales. we also nd that when any of the radii is above the critical radius,

the force is repulsive at all distances.

the second example involves a pair of anti-parallel bps d(p + 1) branes of type
iib/iia string theory on t 4/g, where one of the tangential directions of the branes is
along one of the circles of the torus, and the other tangential directions extend along

the non-compact space-time. the two branes could be separated along the non-compact
directions transverse to the brane, but both branes lie along a common xed line of t 4/g.
(in the dual type iia/iib theory on k3 orbifold, this represents a pair of d(p + 2) branes,
each wrapped on a supersymmetric 2-cycle.) this system is stable if the radius of the
circle tangential to the brane is smaller than 2, and the radii of the circles transverse to
the brane are each larger than (1/2). again we nd that precisely when all the radii take
their critical values, the open string spectrum on this system develops exact bose-fermi

degeneracy, even though the brane conguration is not supersymmetric.

the third example is that of a pair of non-bps dp-branes of type iib/iia placed at two
dierent orbifold points of t 4/g,  at diametrically opposite points of one of the circles of
t 4,  with all directions tangential to the branes lying along the non-compact directions.
this system is stable when the radius of this special circle is larger than 2, and the radii
of the other circles are larger than (1/2). again when all the radii are at their critical
value, the open string spectrum on this system develops exact bose-fermi degeneracy. at

the critical point there is a marginal deformation which interpolates between this system
and the one in the previous example; but one can show that the bose-fermi degeneracy

does not survive along this line of marginal deformation.

the fourth example is that of a pair of bps d(p + 1) branes in iib/iia on t 4/g,
each with one tangential direction along a circle of the torus, but unlike the second
example where these directions are anti-parallel, we take the two directions to be along
two orthogonal circles of the torus representing xed lines on t 4/g that intersect at a
xed point. the two d-branes share the same p + 1 non-compact tangential directions.
the spectrum of open strings living on this system develops exact bose-fermi degeneracy

2we are using  = 1 units.

4

when each of the two circles transverse to both the branes has radius (1/2). this is also
the critical radius below which this system of branes develops a tachyonic mode and hence

becomes unstable.

there are two ways of computing the partition function of open strings living on the
d-brane system,  directly from the spectrum of open strings, or using the boundary state
formalism to represent the d-branes as a source for closed strings, and then computing the
amplitude for emission and reabsorption of closed strings. in the open string calculation

it is easy to work out the normalisation of the partition function, but sometimes it is
dicult to know the rules for projection under various symmetries. in the closed string

computation it is easy to nd the rules for projection under various symmetries, but the
computation of the normalisation factors is dicult. we use both approaches. in section

2 we use the known spectrum of open strings on bps and non-bps d-branes in type ii
string theory on t 4 modded out by g to compute the partition function in examples 1
and 2 in the open string formalism. then in section 3 we repeat the analysis for these

examples in the boundary state formalism, and in the process x the overall normalisation
of the boundary states by comparing with the known answers in section 2. then we carry

out the analysis of examples 3 and 4 using the boundary state formalism.

theories with accidental bose-fermi degeneracy have been used before [5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

10] in postulating the existence of non-supersymmetric string theories with vanishing
cosmological constant. it is tempting to speculate that the type of examples described
here could be useful in constructing orientifold duals of these theories.

the existence of non-bps brane congurations which do not exert any force on each
other also opens up the possibility of putting a large number of such systems together,

unless higher loop corrections generate a repulsive interaction between these systems.
in this case we might expect the near horizon geometry of this system to be described

reliably by a solution of the supergravity equations of motion, thereby giving rise to new
relations between non-supersymmetric eld theories and string theory in the spirit of refs.

[11, 12, 13].

2 examples of non-bps d-brane congurations with

exact bose-fermi degeneracy

in this section we shall construct examples of stable non-bps brane congurations for

which the spectrum of open strings living on the brane has exact bose-fermi degeneracy at
all mass levels, and as a result the force between these branes due to single closed string

exchange vanishes at all distances. the theory that we shall consider is type iib/iia
string theory on t 4 modded out by i4  (1)fl, with i4 denoting the transformation that
reverses the sign of all the coordinates of the torus and fl denoting the contribution
to the space-time fermion number from the left-moving sector of the world-sheet. (this
theory is t-dual to type iia/iib string theory on t 4/i4.) let us denote by x6, . . . , x9
the coordinates on t 4, by r6, . . . , r9 the corresponding radii, and by x0, . . . , x5 the non-
compact coordinates. we shall assume that we have dirichlet boundary conditions on
the brane along the x1, x2 directions, and use a light-cone gauge formalism with x1, x2 as
the light-cone directions; a standard d-brane (with neumann boundary conditions in the

time-direction) can be obtained from this by a double wick rotation [14].

for a given conguration of d-branes, the object of interest is the open string partition

function:

z =z dt

2t

t rn sr(e2thop) ,

(2.1)

where ns and r denote neveu-schwarz and ramond sectors, respectively, p is an appro-
priate projection operator, and ho is the open string hamiltonian:

ho = ~p2 +

1

~w2 +  x=0,3,...9

[

xn=1


n

n +xr>0

r

r

r ] + co .

(2.2)

here ~p denotes the open string momentum along the directions for which the string has

neumann (n) boundary conditions at both ends, and ~w denotes the winding charge
along the directions for which both ends obey dirichlet (d) boundary conditions. 
n and

r denote respectively the bosonic and fermionic oscillators satisfying the commutation
relations:

[

m, 

n] = mm+n,0,

r , 

{

s} = r+s,0 .

(2.3)

for coordinates satisfying the same boundary condition at both ends of the open string
(i.e. both neumann (n) or both dirichlet (d)) n always takes integer values, whereas r
takes integer (integer + 1
2 ) values in the r (ns) sector. on the other hand, for coordinates

6

satisfying dierent boundary conditions at the two ends of the open string (one d and
one n) n takes integer+ 1
2 (integer) values in the r (ns)
2 + s
sector. the normal ordering constant co vanishes in the r-sector and is equal to  1
8
in the ns sector (in  = 1 units) where s denotes the number of coordinates satisfying
d-n boundary conditions. the trace, denoted by t r, is taken over the full fock space of

2 values and r takes integer + 1

the open string, and also includes a sum (integral) over various momentum and winding
numbers, and a sum over the dierent chan paton sectors.

2.1 example 1: bps d-brane wrapped on non-supersymmetric

cycle of k3

we begin with a single non-bps dp-brane [15, 16, 17, 18] in type iib/iia string theory
on t 4/(1)fl  i4. the d-brane is situated at one of the xed points of t 4/(1)fl  i4,
and all p + 1 directions on the world-volume extend along the non-compact space-time.

p is even for type iib string theory, and odd for type iia string theory. (in the t-dual
description this can be regarded as a bps d-(p + 2)-brane in iia/iib wrapped on a
non-supersymmetric cycle of k3 [1, 2].) there are two dierent chan paton sectors, 
labelled by the 2  2 identity matrix i and the pauli matrix 1, , each having its own
rule for gso ((1)f ) projection, and g  i4  (1)fl projection. thus p in eq. (2.1) is
given by:

p =

1 + g

2

.

(2.4)

1 + (1)f

2

(1)f reverses the sign of all the world-sheet fermions, whereas g reverses the sign of the
world-sheet scalar and fermions associated with the x6, . . . , x9 coordinates. in computing
the partition function (2.1) we also need to know how (1)f and g act on the fock vacuum
in the dierent sectors; this is known [16, 17, 19]. in the ns sector we have

i

1

:

:

(1)f = 1
(1)f = 1

g = 1
g = 1 .

(2.5)

thus when we combine the open string spectrum from the two sectors, we see that there is
no net (1)f or g projection, as at a given mass level we have open string states carrying
both (1)f charges and both g charges. however, there is a net (1)f  g projection, since
the fock vacuum in both sectors is odd under (1)f  g, and hence only those open string
states, obtained by oscillators carrying a net (1)f  g charge 1 acting on the vacuum,

7

are allowed in the spectrum. thus the combined contribution of all chan paton factors
to (2.1) from ns sector states can be written as

z dt

2t

trn s e2tho 1 + (1)f  g

2

! ,

(2.6)

where tr now denotes a sum over the oscillators in a single fock space, an integration over
momenta in the non-compact directions, and a sum over winding numbers in the compact
directions, but does not contain a sum over the dierent chan paton factors.

the situation in the ramond sector is even simpler. the ground state is 16-fold de-
generate due to the 8 fermionic zero modes, and it contains an equal number of states
with charge 1 and 1 under each of the three operators (1)f , g and (1)f  g. thus
t rr(e2tho(1)f ), t rr(e2thog), and t rr(e2tho(1)f  g) all vanish, and when we com-
bine the spectrum from the two chan paton sectors, the contribution to (2.1) can be
written as

z dt

2t

trr(e2tho) .

(2.7)

(2.8)

we can now evaluate the contribution from each sector separately. we get

trn s(e2tho) =

where a is the (innite) (p + 1)-dimensional volume of the brane in the non-compact
directions,

and fi are dened in the usual manner [20]:

f4(q) = q 1

f3(q) = q 1

(1 + q2n1) ,

24

24

(2.10)

the origin of the various factors in (2.8) is as follows. the a(2)p+1(2t)(p+1)/2 factor
comes from integration over the open string momenta along the non-compact directions

8

and the f3(q)8/f1(q)8 factor represents the contribution of the bosonic and the fermionic
i comes from the sum over open string winding

i n2

oscillators. the last factor qipni q2r2

modes along the compact directions.

similarly we get

trn s(e2tho(1)f  g) = 

a

(2)p+1 (2t) p+1

2

f3(q)4f4(q)4
f1(q)4f2(q)4 .

 4 

(2.11)

the contribution from the momentum integration along the non-compact directions re-
mains the same but the oscillator contribution changes, since four of the bosonic oscillators
and four of the fermionic oscillators change sign under (1)f  g. there is no contribution
from the winding sector, since (1)f  g takes a state with winding charge ~w to a state
with winding charge  ~w, and hence the contribution from these states vanishes in the
trace. finally, the overall  sign reects the fact that the ns sector ground state is odd
under (1)f  g (which is the reason why this model is free of tachyons).

the contribution from the ramond sector can also be evaluated in a straightforward

manner. we get

trr(e2tho) =

a

(2)p+1 (2t) p+1

f1(q)8

comparing with eq. (2.8) we see that the contribution from momentum integration along
the non-compact directions, and the sum over winding modes in the compact direction

remains the same. the only change is in the contribution from the fermionic oscillators.

combining the contribution from all sectors, and using the (abstruse) identity

we see that the total partition function is given by:

using eqs. (2.15) and (2.18), (2.14) then becomes

z = 0 .

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

since the integrand of z vanishes for all t, this shows that there is exact degeneracy
between bosonic and fermionic open string states at all mass level, although the brane is

non-bps. in order to nd the bosonic and the fermionic spectrum separately, we need to
evaluate (2.12) or the sum of (2.8) and (2.11). this is given by:

a

(2)p+1 (2t) p+1

2 4 

f2(q)4f3(q)4
f1(q)4f4(q)4 .

(2.20)

this is proportional to the partition function of bosonic (or fermionic) open string states

stretched between a bps p-brane and a bps (p + 4)-brane in type ii string theory.

note that the critical radii where the spectrum of open strings develops exact bose-

fermi degeneracy correspond precisely to the values below which the non-bps d-brane
becomes unstable against decay into a pair of bps branes [15]. this is not a coincidence.
for ri > 12 the massless spectrum contains four bosonic states from sector i, four
fermionic states from sector i, and four fermionic states from sector 1. in order to have
bose-fermi degeneracy at the massless level, we need four extra massless bosonic states
which are provided by some of the modes from sector 1 becoming massless at the critical
radius. as we decrease any of the ri below the critical radius, the corresponding mode
becomes tachyonic signalling an instability in the system.

we can use this result to conclude that when r6 = r7 = r8 = r9 = 12, the force
between a pair of non-bps branes of this kind vanishes at all distances. to see this
we note that if we consider a pair of such branes separated by a distance r in any of

the non-compact directions transverse to the brane, then the partition function of open
strings stretched from one of the branes to another is given by the same expression as
(2.14) except for an overall extra factor of qr2/22 in the integrand, reecting the energy

10

associated with the tension of the open string stretched over a distance r. thus at the
critical radius the partition function vanishes, reecting that the potential energy v (r)

between the pair of branes (which is equal to negative of the partition function) vanishes
identically for all r.

i n2

sincepnizz q2r2

i is a monotonically decreasing function of ri (as 0 < q < 1), we see
that for ri > 12 the integrand of eq. (2.14) is a negative denite function. thus v (r) is
positive denite. furthermore since v (r) only depends on r via qr2/22, it follows by the
same argument that v (r) is negative, and hence that v (r) is a monotonically decreasing
function of r. thus for ri > 12, where the non-bps brane is stable, the interaction
between a pair of such branes is repulsive at all distances.

2.2 example 2: pair of bps d-branes wrapped on supersym-

metric cycles of k3

in this section we shall study the example of a parallel bps d-(p+1)-brane d-(p+1) brane
pair, where one direction extends along x9, and the other p + 1 directions on the world-
volume lie along the non-compact space-time directions. as before we are considering
type iib/iia string theory on t 4 modded out by (1)fl  i4, where i4 inverts x6, . . . , x9.
consistency requires that p is odd for type iia string theory, and even for type iib string

theory. we consider the situation where we do not have a wilson line on any of the
branes, and we take them both to be situated at x6 = x7 = x8 = 0, while they can
be separated by a distance r along any of the non-compact directions transverse to the
brane. there are two dierent cases, depending on whether the brane and the anti-brane

carry the same or opposite twisted sector rr charge [15]; here we shall only consider
the situation where the twisted sector rr charge is the same for both branes. (in the

t-dual description this corresponds to a pair of fractional p-branes situated at one of the
orbifold xed points of t 4/i4 in type iia/iib string theory on t 4/i4, carrying the same
twisted sector rr charge, but opposite untwisted sector rr charge. each of these can

be interpreted as a bps (p + 2)-brane wrapped on a supersymmetric cycle [3]. thus each
system is individually bps, but the combined system is not bps, as the rr charges of

the two systems are not aligned.)

we shall compute the partition function of open strings living on this system. since

each of the branes is individually bps, the spectrum of open strings with both ends living
on the same brane is automatically supersymmetric. thus we only need to focus on the

11

open strings with one end on the d-brane and the other end on the d-brane. there are
two such sectors, related by reversal of the orientation of the open strings. but since

both sectors contribute equally to the partition function we shall restrict our attention to
only one sector. thus there is no sum over chan paton factors, and we can express the
partition function (2.1) as

z =z dt

2t

trn sr e2tho 1 + (1)f

2

1 + g

2 ! .

(2.21)

the action of (1)f and g on the world-sheet elds is identical to that described in the
last example, but we need to know the action on the vacuum. since the open string is
stretched between the d-string and the d-string, the ns sector ground state is (1)f
even. on the other hand, from the analysis of ref. [15] we know that the ns sector
ground state carrying zero momentum is projected out under the g projection. thus
it is odd under g.3 in the ramond sector we have a 16-fold degeneracy, and as in the
previous example, the ground state contains an equal number of states carrying +1 and
1 eigenvalues of (1)f , g and (1)f  g. thus only the trr(e2tho) term contributes
from this sector.

we can now easily write down the expression for the contribution from the various

sectors,

trn s(e2tho) =

(2.22)

compared to (2.8), there is an extra factor of qr2/22 reecting the eect of the transverse
separation between the two branes, and the sum over winding numbers along the 9th
direction has been replaced by a sum over momenta, since we now have a neumann

boundary condition along this direction. similarly we get

trn s(e2tho(1)f ) =

(1)f on the ns sector ground state was dened to be the same as in the case of open strings with both
ends on the d-brane, but the sign of (1)f and g in the projection operator was chosen to be negative.
here we have chosen the signs of (1)f and g in the projection operator to be positive, but are taking
the action of these operators on the ns sector ground state to be opposite of that for open strings with
both ends on the d-brane.

substituting this into eq. (2.27) we see that

z = 0 .

thus the spectrum of open strings has exact bose-fermi degeneracy even though the brane

conguration is not supersymmetric. at this critical point in the moduli space, the force
between the pair of branes vanishes for all separations.

by repeating the analysis of the previous example we can easily verify that the partition
function in the ns or r sector is again proportional to that of a bps d-p  d-(p + 4)
brane system in type ii string theory. also, if ri > 12 for 6  i  8, and r9 < 2, the

interaction between the pair of branes is repulsive at all distances.

3 the boundary state approach

it is instructive to compare the above derivation of the bose-fermi degeneracy of the open
string spectrum with that using the closed string theory point of view, describing dirichlet
branes as boundary states [20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. we shall use the conventions of [15]

in the following. let us rst treat the two cases that we have analysed above in turn in
order to x the relevant normalisation constants of the boundary states; we shall then

also construct two new examples.

13

3.1 example 1: bps d-brane wrapped on non-supersymmetric

cycle of k3

this is the same example that we studied in section 2.1,  namely, a non-bps p-brane of
iib/iia on t 4/(1)fl  i4, all of whose tangential directions lie along the non-compact
space-time. let us denote by c  {0, 3, 4, 5} the set of p+1 indices for which the dirichlet
brane satises neumann boundary conditions, and denote by d the complement of c in
{0, 3, 4, 5}. we also denote by dc the union of d with {1, 2}, and by d the union of d
with {6, 7, 8, 9}. the boundary state that represents the non-bps p-brane is of the form
[16]4

where the rst two (last two) states are coherent states in the untwisted nsns (twisted

rr) sector. a denotes the location of the brane in the non-compact directions with
a1 = a2 = 0, and b denotes the location of the brane in the compact directions. since we
always take the brane to lie at one of the xed points of t 4/g, bi can only take the values
0 or ri (6  i  9).  can take values 1, and denotes the sign of the twisted sector
rr charge carried by the brane. up to an overall normalisation, the coherent states are

(uniquely) characterised by the conditions

appearing in (3.5) is uniquely determined by the condition coming from the fermionic
zero modes in eq. (3.2). n , fn are normalisation factors to be determined later.

we are interested in the tree level amplitude that describes the exchange of closed
string states between two identical non-bps dp-branes which are located at the same
xed point of t 4/g (at b = 0, say) and whose positions along the non-compact directions
(indexed by dc) are described by a1 and a2.5 this amplitude is given by

at the critical radii ri = 12 for i = 6, 7, 8, 9, the sums over mi can be simplied us-
ing (2.18), and together with (2.13) this implies that the integrand in (3.13) vanishes

identically.

16

from the point of view of the closed string calculation, the rst line in (3.13) con-
tains the attractive (bulk) gravitational force that is mediated by the massless elds from

the untwisted nsns sector, whereas the second line contains the repulsive force between
objects carrying the same charge with respect to the twisted rr sector. the latter is
independent of the radii of the transverse directions, but the former is inversely propor-

tional to the radii, and also contains winding contributions which become less and less
relevant as the radii are increased. indeed, in the uncompactied theory, the untwisted
sector contribution to the integrand would be proportional to l(9p)/2 for large l, indicat-
ing that the gravitational attraction is much weaker at long distances than the repulsive

force due to the charges.

3.2 example 2: pair of bps d-branes wrapped on supersym-

metric cycles of k3

this is the same example discussed in section 2.2. in this case we are interested in a system
containing a bps d-(p + 1)-brane and its anti-brane in type iib/iia on t 4 modded out
by i4  (1)fl. the branes stretch along the x9 direction, and the other p + 1 directions
of their world-volumes are in the non-compact directions. (in particular, they lie in the
subspace xi = bi for 6  i  8 where bi can take values 0 or ri.) none of the branes carry
any wilson line. if a denotes the location of such a brane in the non-compact directions
( (x1, . . . , x5)) transverse to the brane, the boundary state describing this bps d-(p + 1)
brane is of the form [15]

|d(p + 1), a, b, , i =

(3.14)

 and  can take values 1 and denote the sign of the untwisted sector rr charge and
the twisted sector rr charge, respectively. (thus  =  corresponds to the brane and the
anti-brane, respectively.) the suces indicate the closed string sector to which each state

belongs. for the case of the twisted sectors, nsns;t and rr;t, we have also indicated

17

whether the state is in the sector localised at the xed point x6 = x7 = x8 = x9 = 0 of
t 4/g (as is the case for the states in the second line of eq. (3.14)) or at the xed point
x6 = x7 = x8 = 0, x9 = r9 (as is the case for the states in the third and fourth line
of eq. (3.14)). note that the sign of the twisted sector charges at the x9 = 0 and the
x9 = r9 ends are taken to be the same. this is a consequence of the fact that the branes
do not carry any wilson line along x9; more general cases have been discussed in ref. [15].
the dierent boundary states appearing on the right hand side of eqs. (3.14) are given

as

c9 in eq. (3.16) takes values 0 or r9, and corresponds to twisted sector states associated
to the xed points (b, 0) and (b, r9), respectively. n9 labels the winding number along
x9, and dc is dened as before. the coherent momentum (and winding) eigenstates
|b(p + 1), k, b, ; c9i (in
|b(p + 1), k, m, n9, i (in the case of the untwisted sectors) and
the case of the twisted sectors) are again given by the same formula as in (3.5), the only
dierence being that now c contains also  = 9 and d does not. furthermore the moding
of the fermions in the untwisted rr sector is opposite to that in the untwisted nsns

d

d

sector, and that in the twisted nsns sector is opposite to that in the twisted rr sector
discussed below (3.5).

the normalisation constants m and fm can be determined from the tree level diagram

that describes the exchange of closed string states between two such branes. we take them

to be located at the same point in the compact space (say at b = 0), but at dierent
points a1 and a2 in the non-compact space. we also take them to carry the same twisted
sector rr charges. the relevant term describing the interaction between a pair of branes

of this type is

whereas the last line combines the contributions from the two twisted nsns and rr
sectors at x9 = 0 and x9 = r9. using (2.13) it is clear that the amplitude vanishes
identically if the system preserves supersymmetry, i.e. for 1 = 2.

at the critical radius, r6 = r7 = r8 = 1/2, r9 = 2, the momentum and winding
sums simplify as before using (2.18), and (3.22) vanishes.

from the point of view of the closed string calculation, the rst term in the integrand
of (3.21) contains the gravitational interaction and the interaction due to the exchange

of the untwisted rr elds. in the case of the brane-anti-brane pair, the two branes have
opposite charge with respect to the untwisted rr elds, and therefore both interactions
are attractive. indeed, for 1 = 2 the last factor in the rst term in (3.21) is 2f 8
2 /f 8
1 ,
and so the rst term is strictly positive. the second term contains the interaction due to
the states in the twisted sectors. for the case of brane-anti-brane pair (without wilson
line) the interactions at both xed points of t 4/g are equal and repulsive. this is due to

20

the fact that the two states under consideration carry the opposite twisted nsns and the
same twisted rr charge at each xed point; both lead to a repulsive force. at the critical

point the attractive interaction due to the untwisted sector elds cancels the repulsive
interaction due to the twisted sector elds at all distance scales.

3.3 example 3: a pair of bps d-branes wrapped on non-super-

symmetric cycles of k3

the theory under consideration is again type iib/iia on t 4 modded out by i4  (1)fl.
we shall take a pair of non-bps dp-branes of the type described in section 3.1, one at
(a, b=0) and the other at (a, b=(0, 0, 0, r9)). note that we have taken the locations of
the two branes in the non-compact directions to be identical. in the dual type iia/iib
string theory on t 4/i4, this describes a system containing a pair of non-bps branes, cor-
responding to bps d-branes wrapped on two homologically distinct non-supersymmetric
2-cycles, situated at the same location in the non-compact space-time. the boundary

state describing this system is given by:

|fdp1,fdp2i = |fdp, a, b = 0, 1i + |fdp, a, b = (0, 0, 0, r9), 2i ,

where the boundary states appearing on the right hand side of this equation are identical

(3.23)

by the same identities used in section 3.1 we see that this vanishes exactly at

(3.27)

thus at this critical point the spectrum of open string states on this system develops
exact bose-fermi degeneracy.

note that at this critical radius there is an exact marginal deformation which takes
this system to the system discussed in section 3.2 [15, 17]. thus it is natural to ask if the

bose-fermi degeneracy of the spectrum survives all along this line of marginal deformation.
this is however not the case. from the arguments in ref. [17] it is easy to see that

the spectrum in the ramond sector does not change during this marginal deformation,
whereas the spectrum in the ns sector certainly does. thus the bose-fermi degeneracy in

the spectrum can only appear at special points along this critical line.

3.4 example 4: a pair of bps d-branes wrapped on supersym-

metric cycles of k3

this example will involve a system similar to that discussed in section 3.2,  the only
dierence being that instead of taking a pair of anti-parallel bps d(p + 1) branes in type
iib/iia on t 4 modded out by (1)fl  i4, we shall consider a pair of orthogonal bps
d(p+1) branes.6 in particular we shall take both d-branes to span the same non-compact
directions, but take the rst d-brane to lie along x9 at b  (x6 = 0, x7 = 0, x8 = 0), and
the second d-brane to lie along x8 at b  (x6 = 0, x7 = 0, x9 = 0). if  denotes the sign of
the twisted rr charge of the rst d-brane at the xed points (0, 0, 0, 0) and (0, 0, 0, r9),
and  denotes the sign of the twisted rr charge of the second d-brane at the xed points
(0, 0, 0, 0) and (0, 0, r8, 0), a and a denote their locations in the non-compact directions,
and ,  denote the sign of the untwisted sector rr charges, then the boundary state of
the combined system is given by

|d(p + 1), a, b, , i + |d(p + 1), a, b, , i ,

(3.28)

where |d(p + 1), a, b, , i is the boundary state dened in section 3.2, and |d(p +
1), a, b, , i is related to the boundary state dened in section 3.2 by exchanging the
8th and the 9th coordinates everywhere.

6some aspects of tachyon condensation on d-branes at angles have been recently discussed in [27].

in computing the amplitude describing the emission and reabsorption of closed strings
from this system, we note that since each system is individually bps the amplitude for

emission and reabsorption of a closed string by the same d-brane will vanish identically.
thus the relevant amplitude which needs to be analysed is

z 

0

dl hd(p + 1), a, b, , |elhc|d(p + 1), a, b, , i .

(3.29)

each of the boundary states in this expression has components in the untwisted nsns
and rr sectors, as well as the twisted nsns and rr sectors. the calculation can be

simplied by noting that in any sector which contains zero modes of the fermion elds

8, 9, e8, e9, the two fock vacua appearing in the expression for the two boundary

states in eq. (3.29) are orthogonal since they satisfy dierent constraints coming from
the fermionic zero modes in the analogue of eq. (3.2). thus the contribution to (3.29)
from these sectors vanishes. this leaves us with the untwisted nsns and the twisted rr

sectors. furthermore, among the various twisted sector rr states appearing in (3.28),
only the sector that is localised at x6 = x7 = x8 = x9 = 0 contributes to (3.29), since this
is the only sector that is shared by both boundary states. the contribution can be easily
evaluated, and gives

the radius r6 = r7 = 1/2 is critical in the sense that for ri < 1/2, i = 6, 7, the
open string that begins on one d(p + 1)-brane and ends on the other contains a tachyon.
indeed, in this case the co in eq. (2.2) is equal to (1/4), and the energy of the winding
states with winding number (n6, n7) along the 6th and the 7th directions is given by


4



+ (n6r6)2 + (n7r7)2 .

(3.39)

the n6 = n7 = 0 mode is projected out, but appropriate linear combinations of the states
with (n6, n7) = (1, 0) or (n6, n7) = (0,1) survive. at least one of them is tachyonic
whenever r6 or r7 is below (1/2), and the system is therefore unstable in this regime.
for generic values of the radii r8 and r9 there does not seem to be any simple system
of d-branes into which this system can decay. this leads us to suspect that below the
critical values of r6 and/or r7 the system forms a bound state which cannot be described
by a solvable boundary conformal eld theory of a system of d-branes.
