abstract

we investigate further our recent proposal for the form of the matrix theory action in
weak background elds. using seibergs scaling argument we relate the matrix theory
action to a low-energy system of many d0-branes in an arbitrary but weak ns-ns and
r-r background. the resulting multiple d0-brane action agrees with the known born-
infeld action in the case of a single brane and gives an explicit formulation of many
additional terms which appear in the multiple brane action. the linear coupling to
an arbitrary background metric satises the nontrivial consistency condition suggested
by douglas that the masses of o-diagonal elds are given by the geodesic distance
between the corresponding pair of d0-branes. this agreement arises from combinatorial
factors which depend upon the symmetrized trace ordering prescription found earlier
for higher moments of the matrix theory stress-energy tensor. we study the eect of
a weak background metric on two graviton interactions and nd that our formalism
agrees with the results expected from supergravity. the results presented here can be
t-dualized to give explicit formulae for the operators in any d-brane world-volume
theory which couple linearly to bulk gravitational elds and their derivatives.

1 introduction

over the past few years our understanding of string theory has developed considerably. we
now know that the ve superstring theories as well as low-energy 11-dimensional supergrav-
ity are related through an intricate series of dualities and it has been argued that all these
theories are limits of an underlying 11-dimensional theory called m-theory [1] whose micro-
scopic description is as yet unknown. it has been found that in addition to one-dimensional
stringlike excitations there are higher-dimensional branes in each of these theories which
may in some regimes be considered to be just as fundamental as the strings.
in the ve
superstring theories there are d-branes of various dimensions [2] as well as the fundamental
string and ns5-branes. in m-theory there are m2-branes and m5-branes which are related
to the branes of the superstring theories through various duality transformations.

a fundamental class of problems is the identication of the world-volume action for the
various branes appearing in the six theories of interest. this problem can be posed in a
number of contexts of diering degrees of complexity. the simplest problem is to nd the
low-energy action for a single brane in a at background metric with no nontrivial background
supergravity elds. a more dicult problem is to nd the action for a single brane in an
arbitrary background metric and eld conguration which satises the supergravity equations
of motion. the problem can be made still harder by considering systems of many branes,
either in a at or general background. even for a single fundamental superstring the action
in a general background including arbitrary r-r elds is not yet well understood; for recent
work in this direction see, for example, [3] and references therein. for single d-branes the
situation is somewhat better. the action for a single d-brane moving in a general background
is the born-infeld action [4], which reduces to the maximally supersymmetric u(1) super
yang-mills theory on the world volume in the case where the brane is almost at and has
only low-energy excitations. this action is supplemented by chern-simons type couplings
to background r-r elds [5, 6]. even for the single d-brane, however, there are subtle issues
involved in giving a world-volume supersymmetric description of the born-infeld theory.
for systems of n d-branes, it is known that the low-energy action for parallel branes in
a at background is given by the supersymmetric u(n) super yang-mills theory found by
dimensional reduction from 10d [7]. so far there has been little progress in describing the
action governing systems of many d-branes in a general background. this problem is due in
part to the absence of a nonabelian generalization of the born-infeld action (although one
proposal for such an action was made in [8]), and in part to ordering problems which arise
even in the low-energy theory in the presence of general backgrounds.

in this paper we consider the simplest system of many d-branes in a general background:
low-energy congurations of many d0-branes moving in an arbitrary but weak background
of type iia supergravity. according to an argument of seiberg [9] (see also [10]), the action
for such a system of d0-branes should be related to the dlcq description of m-theory in
an associated 11-dimensional supergravity background. this generalizes the bfss matrix
theory conjecture [11, 12], which states that supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics

1

(the low-energy theory of n d0-branes in at space) gives a light-front description of m-
theory in a at background. in a previous paper [13] we used a matrix theory formulation
of the multipole moments of the supercurrent components in 11d supergravity (derived in
[14, 15, 13]) to propose an explicit description of the matrix theory action up to terms linear
in the background elds, as well as an algorithm for using higher-loop calculations in matrix
theory to nd the higher order terms in the matrix theory action in general backgrounds.
in this paper, we use our proposal for the general background matrix theory action and
follow the arguments of seiberg to deduce the leading terms in the action for multiple d0-
branes in weak type iia supergravity backgrounds. we then perform some simple tests of
the matrix theory action and the related multiple d0-brane action. in the d0-brane case,
we show that our prescription satises a constraint originally suggested by douglas [16] that
the masses of o-diagonal matrix elements between a pair of separated d0-branes agree with
the minimal geodesic length between the d0-branes. this property holds also in the matrix
theory case where the separated objects are a pair of gravitons, and we use it to show that the
leading order potential between a pair of gravitons in a weakly curved ricci-at background
is correctly reproduced by the proposed general background matrix theory action.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we review our proposal for the linear
terms in the general background matrix theory action. then, using this action, we follow
the arguments of seiberg to deduce leading terms in the action for multiple d0 branes in an
arbitrary weak type iia supergravity background. in section 3 we describe tests of the iia
and matrix theory actions. we conclude in section 4 with a discussion of related issues and
comments on further directions.

2 linear coupling to backgrounds

in subsection 2.1 we recall the proposal made in [13] for the terms in the action of matrix
theory which are linear in the background elds.
in subsection 2.2 we use the approach
of seiberg to relate this matrix theory action to an action for multiple d0-branes in iia
background elds. this allows us to deduce the leading terms in the multiple d0-brane
action, which to the best of our knowledge have not been previously described.

2.1 backgrounds in matrix theory

in [13] we proposed that the linear eects of a general matrix theory background with metric
gij = ij + hij and 3-form eld aijk could be described by supplementing the at space
matrix theory action

sat =

in (2) the matrix expressions t ij(i1in), j ijk(i1in), m ijklm n (i1in) are the matrix theory
forms of the multipole moments of the stress-energy tensor, membrane current and 5-brane
current of 11d supergravity. explicit forms for the parts of these moments depending only
on the 9 bosonic transverse matrices x i were given in [15], and the terms quadratic in the
fermions were given in [13], as well as some terms quartic in the fermions. for example, the
zeroeth moments of the components of the stress-energy tensor are given by

these components of the stress-energy tensor

the contributions sym (str (y ); x i1, . . . , x in) are dened as the symmetrized average over

order to the higher multipole moments, of which the simplest example is the spin contribution
to the angular momentum

the precise form of these fermionic contributions will not be important to us in this paper,
for reasons which will be discussed in section 3.1.3.

the results of [13] for the matrix membrane and 5-brane currents are reproduced in the
appendix for convenience. with these denitions, (2) gives a formulation of matrix theory
in a weak background metric to rst order in the metric hij , the 3-form aijk, and all their
higher derivatives. it was argued in [13] that if the matrix theory conjecture is true in at
space, this formulation must be correct at least to order 4h, 4a for a class of backgrounds
which can be produced as the long range elds around supergravity sources described by
matrix theory objects. we conjectured further that this form may work to all orders and in
a general background. it should be emphasized, however, that this formulation can only be
given for m-theory backgrounds with a global u(1) symmetry around a compact direction, as
we do not know how to incorporate dependence of the background on the compact coordinate
x. we only expect this action to be part of a consistent all-orders matrix theory action in a
general background when the background satises the equations of motion. the derivation
of this action also depended upon a particular choice of gauge for the graviton, so that it
may be necessary to restrict attention to background elds satisfying the linearized gauge

i hij = i (hij

k ) = 0.

2.2 backgrounds for d0-branes

we now investigate how the matrix theory action described in the previous section is related
to the action for multiple d0-branes in background type iia supergravity elds.

in the case of a at background, the matrix theory action may be derived by showing
an equivalence between the dlcq limit of m-theory in a at background with n units of
momentum around the circle and a particular limit of type iia string theory with n d0-
branes [9]. in this limit, the only remaining degrees of freedom are the lowest energy modes
of open strings ending on the n d0-branes. the dynamics of these modes are in general
described by a non-abelian generalization of the born-infeld action whose complete form is
not known. however, in the appropriate limit of type iia string theory, most of the terms in
this action vanish, and we nd that the dynamics of dlcq m-theory in a at background
are described by an action equivalent to the dimensional reduction of d=10 super yang-mills
theory to 0+1 dimensions.

the action for matrix theory with background supergravity elds given in the previ-
ous section has been derived completely within the context of matrix theory. however, in
principle, one should be able to apply seibergs arguments to this case also and derive the
same action as a limit of the action for d0-branes in type iia string theory with background
supergravity elds. again, only particular terms in the d-brane action will survive in the
appropriate limit, but unlike the at space case, not even these terms are known except in
the case of a single brane. hence, in the case n = 1, we should be able to rederive our
result from previously known facts about d-branes, but more importantly, we will be able

4

to apply the arguments in reverse for n > 1 to derive previously unknown leading terms in
the action for multiple d0-branes in an arbitrary weak type iia supergravity background.
using t-duality, our result may be extended to give leading terms in the actions for all other
types of d-branes.

2.2.1 relationship between dlcq and type iia backgrounds

we now review the steps taken in [9] as they apply in the case of weak backgrounds to make
precise the relationship between the matrix theory action and the multiple d0-brane actions.
in particular, we must determine the relationship between the d=11 supergravity elds
appearing in the matrix theory action (2) and the type iia supergravity elds appearing in
the related d0-brane action.

we start by considering m-theory with background metric

gij = ij + hij

in a frame with a compact coordinate x of size r which is light-like in the at space limit
hij = 0. this theory can be described as a limit of a family of space-like compactied
theories. dening an m -theory with background metric

gij = ij + hij

in a frame with a spacelike compact direction x10 of size rs, the dlcq limit of the original
m-theory can be found by boosting the m -theory in the x10 direction with boost parameter

 = vuut

r2
2r2
s

+ 1

and then taking a limit rs  0. the metric gij in the m -theory is related to that of the
original m-theory by

m-theory on a small spacelike circle of radius rs is equivalent to type iia string theory

where mp is the eleven-dimensional planck mass. here we have dened gs to be a constant
and chosen the dilaton  so that  = 0 in the case of a circle of constant size rs with
h10 10 = 0. thus the eective string coupling is given locally by the combination

gs(~x) = gse.

combining the two equivalences, we conclude that dlcq m-theory with n units of momen-
tum on a lightlike circle of size r and background metric gij is equivalent to the rs  0
limit of type iia string theory with n d0-branes, parameters

at rst glance, such a limit seems problematic. in particular, it appears that for xed
nite values of the dlcq metric components, the background elds of the equivalent type
iia theory diverge in the limit rs  0 since 1/  . however, recall from the at space
case that without a further rescaling of the parameters in the type iia picture, the energies
of the states we are interested in go to 0 like rs. as we shall see, the appropriate rescaling of
parameters which makes the energies we are interested in nite without changing the physics
also ensures that the apparent divergences of background eld components do not lead to
divergent terms in the nal action.

another feature of this action is that after the appropriate rescaling the characteristic
length scale l associated with the structure of the metric becomes much smaller than the
string length 1/ms. while this may seem unusual, it is precisely what is needed for the
physics of the system to be completely captured by the open string theory describing the
d0-brane theory at substring scales studied in [17]. indeed, for compact manifolds such as
tori, it is this eect which makes it possible for the wrapped string modes corresponding to
momentum excitations on the dual space to become physically relevant [18, 9].

2.2.2 n = 1 actions

we now use the correspondence just discussed to make an explicit comparison between the
matrix theory and iia descriptions of a system of n 0-branes in a weak background eld. we
begin with the case n = 1. here, both the matrix theory and d0-brane actions are known,
so we would like to check that the matrix theory action may be derived from the d0-brane
action before proceeding to the case n > 1 where the d0-brane action is not known. for
the case n = 1, the matrix theory action (1,2) reduces to

s =

(8)

in this case we expect the action to describe a single graviton in curved space with unit
momentum along the lightlike circle. such an action was derived from supergravity in [14];
expression (8) is indeed identical to the supergravity result given by equation (13) in that
paper.

the world-volume action for a single d0-brane moving in a general type iia background

supergravity elds is given by

siia = 0z deqg(dx/d)(dx/d) + 0z cdx

(9)

where , g, and c are the background dilaton, metric, and r-r one-form elds, and the
parameter 0 is the d0 mass, given by

0 =

ms
gs

.

7

one can also consider background r-r three form c and ns-ns antisymmetric tensor
b elds, but these do not couple to a single zero-brane.

according to the equivalence presented in the previous section, the matrix theory action
(8) should arise from the d0-brane action (9) by rewriting the type iia background elds in
terms of the desired dlcq supergravity background using the relations (7), then rescaling
parameters and taking the limit rs  0. we will now verify this explicitly. choosing a
gauge in which the coordinate time x0 is identied with the worldvolume time  we rst
expand the d0-brane action to leading order in the background elds, giving

00 + 2h0ivi + hijvivj)  c0  civi(cid:27)
s = 0z d(cid:26)(1  v2)1/2(1  ) 
(10)
where vi  xi. we now write the iia background elds in terms of the background elds in
the equivalent dlcq m-theory using (7). keeping only the leading term in rs/r for each
of the components of the metric hij , we nd

many of these terms seem to diverge in the rs  0 limit we are interested in. however, as
mentioned above, this scaling is deceptive, since we must rescale parameters in the theory so
that the energies of the states we are interested in remain nite rather than going to zero in
the limit. indeed, from the fact that the conjugate momentum has a leading term of order
v/rs it can be seen that all the terms in (11) which are linear in the background contribute
to the hamiltonian at order rs. thus, as we need for the seiberg limit, the energy of the
states of interest scale as rs.

we may now perform the rescaling of [9] by replacing

h(~x)  h(~x).

note that the change of variables in the second replacement combines with the rescaling of
dimensionful coecients in the expansion of h to leave h(~x) unchanged, as suggested by the
nal replacement.

with these redenitions the action (11) becomes

the rst term is divergent in the rs  0 limit and arises from the bps energy of the single
0-brane; this term also appears in the at space theory and is discounted in the matrix theory

8

limit. dropping this term gives precisely the matrix theory action described by (8) in the
n = 1 case. thus, we have shown that the known born-infeld action for a single d0-brane
correctly reproduces the matrix theory action in a weak background when the proper limit
is taken.

2.2.3 n > 1 actions

we now turn to the case n > 1. here, the appropriate action for multiple d0-branes is not
known, but by requiring that it reproduces the general background matrix theory action in
the seiberg limit, we will be able to deduce its leading terms.

we rst write down the d0-brane action in terms of the unknown quantities coupling to
the background elds. we dene quantities ix coupling linearly to each of the background
elds, so that to leading order in the background elds, the action for n d0 branes is

s = sat +z dt

here, sat is the at space action for n d0-branes, whose leading terms are the dimensional
reduction of d=10 sym theory to 0+1 dimensions. the complete form of the higher order
terms in the at space action is not known, but these terms vanish in the matrix theory
limit. we assume that the background satises the source-free iia supergravity equations
of motion so that the dual elds c, b, c (3) are well-dened 7-, 6- and 5-form elds given (at
linear order) by

d c = dc,

d b = db,

d c (3) = dc (3).

(13)
the sources i2n are associated with dirichlet 2nbrane currents, while the sources is and
i5 are associated with fundamental string and ns5-brane currents respectively. it may seem
surprising that a system of d0-branes can give rise to a nonzero d2-brane, d4-brane or
d6-brane charge.
indeed, the integrated higher brane charges must vanish for a system
containing a nite number n of d0-branes. even for n = 2, however, a d0-brane congura-
tion can have nonvanishing multipole moments of higher d-brane charges. this essentially
arises as the t-dual of the result that the nth power of the curvature form f on a dirichlet
dp-brane carries (p  2n)-brane charge [19, 5]; see [20] and references therein for a further
discussion of this issue.

the problem we address in this subsection is the determination of the iia currents ix
under the assumption that this action reproduces the matrix theory action (2) in the seiberg
limit. as we will see, the leading terms in all the currents other than i5 can be determined
and are related to the matrix theory supercurrent components tabulated in the appendix.

in the nonabelian case n > 1, the quantities ix will be some complicated functions of the
n  n hermitian matrices x i as well as the fermionic matrices . for each i, we can make
an expansion analogous to expanding in velocities for the n = 1 case. we write

ix = x ix[n]

x
where n counts the dimension of a function of the matrices x, , giving x dimension 1,
dimension 2 and  dimension 3/2. if we do a similar expansion for the at space action
s0, we nd that it is precisely the n = 4 terms that remain in the matrix theory limit, the
higher order terms being scaled to zero. in the general background case, the matrix theory
action will arise from terms in with n  8 (and their higher moments), so it is these terms
that our analysis will determine.

we now proceed just as in the n = 1 case. we begin by working through the details of
the analysis for those terms coupling to the iia graviton, dilaton and r-r 1-form eld. these
terms are the most complicated. the analysis for the remaining bosonic elds is described
at the end of this section.

by the seiberg equivalences, the matrix theory action with background supergravity elds
should result from replacing the iia background elds in (12) with their dlcq counterparts
(7), rescaling parameters as above, and taking the limit rs  0. before rescaling, we nd

because the distance scale associated with the metric is rescaled along with the transverse
coordinates in the rescaling of [9], the rescaling of the partial derivatives in these expressions
cancel the scaling of the moment indices. thus, the higher moment terms which remain in
the rs  0 limit are precisely those corresponding to 0th moments which remain in the
limit. the only terms in (15) which remain in the limit other than the leading divergent
d0-brane energy term should be nite terms corresponding to the matrix theory action (2).
all terms which are linear in the background and carry positive powers of r/rs in the
limit must cancel for the iia action to agree with the matrix theory action. this gives a
number of restrictions on the parts of the iia currents with particular scaling dimensions.

we will assume that the degrees at which a given current ix has nonvanishing contributions
are the same as in the n = 1 case. these are the terms for which we have explicitly written
constraints in (16). this assumption agrees with what we know about the nonabelian born-
infeld action. if this assumption is incorrect, there may be additional terms appearing in the
iia currents at other orders which do not contribute to the matrix theory action. identical
relations to (16) must hold for the quantities coupling to higher order terms in the taylor
expansion of the metric.

so far, we have only dealt with the case of a background metric h, dilaton eld  and r-r
1-form eld c. the same sort of analysis can be applied for backgrounds having nonvanishing
2-form b or 3-form c (3) elds and their duals, and in fact the analysis is simpler in these
cases.
in order to describe nontrivial background antisymmetric tensor elds, we must
generalize the relations (7) which connect the iia background elds to the 11d background
3-form eld through the seiberg limit. the b and c (3) elds are related to components of
the 3-form eld through

there are a number of comments worth making about the identications (19). first, note
that the factor of 3 appearing in the currents is arises from our somewhat unconventional
choice of normalization for the couplings apj p between a p-form eld and its associated
current. often, a factor of 1/p! is included in the denition of this coupling. with that
redenition of the currents, the factors of 3 in our relations would disappear. we have
chosen our convention for the coupling to conform with previous literature on the subject.
next, we briey discuss the physical interpretation of the leading terms in (19). the
is the total membrane charge of the d0-brane system. this result

leading term j +ij in i 0ij
2

is the t-dual of the statement that r f on a p-brane is the total (p  2)-brane charge
coupling to the (p 1)-form r-r eld [5]. although one might think that this should be the
only contribution to the d2-brane charge of the system, additional contributions may arise
from the geometry of the brane embedding [22, 23, 24, 25]. note that while for nite n
the integrated membrane charge j +ij = tr [x i, x j] vanishes identically (since a nite size
system can have no net membrane charge) the higher moments of the d2-brane charge can
be nonvanishing and will couple to the derivatives of the c (3) eld.

13

the leading term in i 0i
s

is the net string winding charge in direction i; this is simply the
t-dual of the poynting vector giving momentum on a dual d-brane. the leading term in
the current i ij
is perhaps somewhat surprising. although this term itself vanishes for nite
s
size matrices, as mentioned above, the rst moment is nonvanishing. the existence of this
term indicates that there will be a coupling in the multiple d0-brane action of the form

[ibjk]tr (x [ix jx k] + fermions).

(20)

we are rather confused as to the physical origin of this term.
indeed, this term plays a
puzzling role in several related situations. for example, after compactication on t 3, the
term j +ij should be related by a duality transformation to the ns5-brane charge of the iia
theory [26], which we discuss below. it may be possible to understand the role of this term
in the theory by studying a t-dual system such as a dual multiple d3-brane conguration.
we discuss the connection with the dual theory briey in the last section of this paper.

now let us consider the currents coupling to the dual elds b and c (3). these currents
can be derived in a fashion precisely analogous to the above argument by considering the
elds related to the dual 6-form a of the 11d theory. we nd

(21)

where

just as for is, conservation relations for i4 suggest that

5

)6  (i ijklm

4

)6 = 6m ijklm.

ti 0ijkl(m)

4

= i ijklm

4

from which it follows that

(i ijklm

4

)6 = 6tm +ijkl(m) = 6m ijklm,

(i 0ijklm

5

)6 = 0.

4

the leading term in i 0ijkl

is the net d4-brane charge [27, 26]. this is the dual of the
instanton number on a dp-brane. unfortunately, we only know from matrix theory the
components of the 5-brane current m ijklm with one  index. thus, we can only determine
the leading term in the components i 0ijkl
of the d4-brane current, and we have no information
about the leading terms in the remaining components of i4 or any components of the ns5-
brane current i5. the absence of any known operator for the transverse 5-brane charge
m +ijklm in matrix theory is an infamous problem. no operator of this form appears in
the supersymmetry algebra [27] or in the one-loop eective potential [15]. nonetheless, we
should expect higher moments of this operator to appear, corresponding to local transverse

4

14

5-brane charge. it has been argued that in a t-dual 3-brane picture the desired operator
is s-dual to the charge of a d5-brane perpendicular to the 3-brane [26] (described by the
operator j +ij mentioned above), although no explicit description of this dual operator has
been given. it would be nice to have a better understanding of these terms in the multiple
d0-brane action.

finally, we consider the currents coupling to the dual eld c. we expect the iia 6-brane
current to couple to this eld. unlike the other branes whose currents we have considered,
the iia 6-brane does not arise in a simple fashion from the dimensional reduction of the
membrane or the 5-brane of 11d m-theory. rather, the iia 6-brane represents a nontrivial
metric of kaluza-klein monopole form in the 11d theory. nonetheless, in [13] we found a
matrix theory description of interactions between such metrics and 0-branes. this appeared
in the form of a term in the 2-body matrix theory potential which coupled the 0-brane stress
tensor to a 10d 6-brane current s . since this current already has an essentially 10d
form, it is natural to map it directly to the 6-brane current we expect in the iia theory.
thus, we believe that the 6-brane current of a system of many 0-branes which couples to
the background c eld will be given by

i 0ijklmn
6
i ijklmnp
6

= s+ijklmn + o(v5)
= sijklmnp + o(v6)

(22)

where the matrix theory form of the 6-brane current is given in the appendix.

2.3 summary of results for multiple d0-brane action in iia

the multipole moments of the stress tensor ih and currents coupling to the background
dilaton and r-r 1-form eld have leading terms given by (17). the currents coupling to the
ns-ns antisymmetric 2-form eld and the r-r 3-form eld have leading terms given by (19).
of the currents coupling to the duals of these two elds, we have only been able to identify
leading term in the the moments of the 4-brane current component i 0ijkl
as described in
(21). we believe that the leading terms in the components of the 6-brane current coupling
to the dual of the 1-form eld are as given in (22).

we have derived these results based on our proposal in [13] for the form of the matrix
theory action in weak background elds and seibergs scaling argument. our results agree
with the known terms in the n = 1 born-infeld action, and with the known bps charges of
the multiple d0-brane system. in the following section we give a simple test of the results
for the terms coupling to the background metric. further possible tests, applications, and
extensions of these results are discussed in the concluding section.

3 tests of the action

in this section, we test our proposals for the general background actions through two related
calculations. first, we consider the d0-brane action in a background describing two seperated
branes in a curved space (hij 6= 0). we determine the masses of o diagonal bosonic and
fermionic elds and show that these exactly match the geodesic distance to leading order in
h in agreement with the constraint suggested by douglas. next, we consider the analogous
background in matrix theory and compute the leading order one-loop potential between two
gravitons in a curved transverse space, showing that curved-space supergravity predictions
are reproduced.

3.1 the geodesic length criterion

one of the earliest discussions of the problem of formulating a low-energy theory for many
d0-branes moving in a curved space was given in [16]. in that paper, douglas argued that
one of the most basic conditions which such an action must satisfy is that in a background
corresponding to a pair of d0-branes living at points x and y there should be light elds
with masses equal to the geodesic length between these points. this condition, together with
additional axiomatic assumptions, was used by douglas, kato and ooguri in [28] to give the
rst few terms in the d0-brane action on a general calabi-yau 3-fold which preserves some
supersymmetry. in this section we show that our formulation of the linearized coupling to a
weak background in the multi-d0-brane action satises douglass geodesic length criterion.

3.1.1 setup

we wish to consider a pair of d0-branes at separated points in a weakly curved space. we
assume that the transverse metric is described by a small perturbation about a at back-
ground, gij = ij + hij, while the other components of the metric and the other background
elds are trivial. without loss of generality, we choose coordinates so that one brane is at
the origin, while the other has transverse coordinates ri. the situation is described by the
multi-d0-brane action (12) with non-zero hij and elds expanded about background matrices
as

x i =   ri 0

0 0 ! +   i zi
zi  i !

(23)

16

 =   0 0

0 0 ! +  i i

i ! ,

i

here, the elds , z, , and  represent uctuations about the background. the geodesic
length condition formulated by douglas states that the masses of the o-diagonal elds z
and , which arise from strings stretched between the separated branes, should precisely
match the geodesic length measured by the metric hij between the points 0 and ri. we will
now compute both the geodesic length and the oscillator masses and show that they agree.

3.1.2 geodesic distance

we begin with the geodesic length between points 0 and ri. this geodesic length is the
minimum value of the length

z

ds = z ri

0 qgijdxidxj

(24)

taken over all paths  between the two points. because the geodesic path is an extremum of
this functional, the variation of the length under a small variation  of the path is of order
()2. since we are interested in changes in the length which are linear in the background
metric, we can therefore neglect eects from the change of the geodesic path and simply
evaluate the change in the geodesic length by integrating (24) along the straight line which
is the geodesic in the at metric. thus, we take

xi() = ri

d(0, ri) = z 1

this gives us the geodesic length between the two points to linear order in the background
metric. in the following section, it will be most convenient to compare squared oscillator
masses with the squared geodesic length, given by

d2 = r2 + rirjhij + o(h2)

17

(25)

3.1.3 oscillator masses

we now calculate the masses of the o-diagonal elds. from (12), we nd that the n = 2
d0-brane action in the case of a transverse background metric has leading terms

j[x i, ](cid:27) x k1    x kn(cid:19)

(26)

(27)

we note here that this is precisely the action for matrix theory in a background hij to leading
order in the metric. in the next section we will use exactly this action to calculate the one-
loop potential between two gravitons, taking the same background (23), though allowing ~r
to be a function of time. such a calculation is simplest using a gauge xed version of the
action in which we choose the background eld gauge, adding a term

sf ix =

1

r z (dtx 0 + i[bi, x i])2

plus the appropriate ghost terms. for later convenience, we will analyze this gauge xed
version, keeping in mind both the matrix theory interpretation and d0-brane interpretations.
unlike the matrix theory action, the complete d0-brane action contains additional terms
both in the background intependent part and coupled to hij. however these cannot con-
tribute to the quadratic action since they contain more than two matrices (eg x i, fij, )
in which there are no entries depending only on background elds. similarly, the terms
t ij(k1kn), whose form has not been worked out for n > 1 involve at least two fermions 
x or [x i, x j] and so contribute only cubic and higher order terms to the
and one power of
action, irrelevant for determining the oscillator masses or computing the one loop potential.
we now replace x and  in the action with the matrices given in (23), and write down
the terms in the action quadratic in the o diagonal elds z and . it turns out that the
symmetrization prescription for ordering the matrices in t ij(k1kn) is very important here,
since most of the orderings give no contribution to the quadratic terms we are interested in.
for example, the rst term in (27) contains a term

1
2n!

(k1    knhij) str ( x i x j x k1    x kn)
=

for which only the m = 0 and m = n terms contribute to the quadratic action in the o
diagonal eld z. summing over n, this contribution gives

note that the quantity hij is simply the function hij integrated over the straight line tra-
jectory between 0 and ~r,

hij = z 1

hij(~r)d

which also appeared at rst order in the geodesic distance formula (25). using this denition,
it is straightforward to write down the remaining terms in the quadratic actions for each of
the o diagonal elds.

bosonic terms

in exactly the same way as for the terms just derived, we nd that the complete set of

terms to leading order in h for the nine transverse bosonic elds is

sb = zi{(2

t + r2)(ij + hij) + rkrlhklij  rirkhkj  hikrkrj}zj

note that the matrix (ij + hij) multiplies all terms not containing h. since the remaining
terms are already of order h, if we redene zi to eliminate this factor in the rst terms, the
remaining terms will only be changed at second order in h. after such a eld redenition, the
kinetic term is proportional to the identity, and the squared oscillator masses are therefore
given by the eigenvalues of the constant matrix

m = r2

0
...
0
h1r




0

  

h1r
...
h8r
   h8r 2hrr

+ o(h2)







here, to simplify the formulae, we have made a rotation so that ~r lies in the 9 direction,
which we refer to using the index r. it is straightforward to solve directly for the eigenvalues
and eigenvectors of this mass matrix, and one nds to this order that the masses are

7 = r2(1 + hrr), m2

m2
1 =    = m2
where the index i is summed from 1 to 8. the oscillators with masses m9 and m8 correspond
to directions lying in the plane dened by the r direction and the perpendicular vector
hir. the remaining oscillators correspond to the directions perpendicular to these and have

9 = r2(1 qh 2

8 = r2(1 +qh 2

rr + hrihir), m2

rr + hrihir)

19

masses which precisely match the geodesic distance (25) to leading order in h. the agreement
between the masses of these perpendicular oscillators and the geodesic distance is precisely
the criterion used by douglas et al.
in [16, 28] to constrain the leading terms in multiple
d0-brane action on certain classes of manifolds. the fact that the oscillators corresponding
to elds not perpendicular to the separation have dierent masses is also expected. in the
non-gauge xed theory, the o-diagonal elds in the direction of the separation between the
branes simply give a combination of a gauge rotation of the system and a relative motion of
the d0-branes along a at direction. this eect explains the failure of the masses m8, m9 to
satisfy douglass criterion.

gauge field

for a time independent ~r, there is no mixing between gauge eld and the other bosonic
oscillators in the quadratic action, and we nd that the quadratic terms involving the o
diagonal eld z0 are simply

sa = z0{2

t + r2 + r2hrr}z0

hence, the o diagonal gauge eld also has mass equal to the geodesic distance to leading
order in h,

m2

0 = r2 + hrr .

ghost fields

since our gauge xing term does not depend on the background metric, the o diagonal

ghost elds will have a mass given by m2

g = r2, as in the at space case, with action

sg = c{2

t + r2}c

fermionic fields

proceeding in the same way for the quadratic fermion action, we nd that the action

quadratic in the o diagonal eld  is

sf =  {it + i

(ri +

1
2

hijrj)}

thus, in the presence of a background metric, the quadratic fermion action is only changed
by a shift

ri  ri +

1
2

hijrj

so the sixteen fermion elds  have a mass squared matrix given by

m 2

f = 11(r2 + hijrirj + o(h2)) = 11r2(1 + hrr + o(h2))

20

we see that all the fermionic oscillators have a mass which reproduces the geodesic distance
to leading order in h.

summary

to summarize, we have found eight complex bosons (including the gauge eld) and sixteen
real fermions with masses equal to the geodesic distance between 0 and ~r. additionally, there
rr + hrihir) and

rr + hrihir) and m2 = r2(1qh 2

are complex bosons with m2 = r2(1 +qh 2

two complex ghosts with m2 = r2.

thus, the sum of the squared masses weighted by the number of degrees of freedom is
identical for the fermions and the bosons (including the ghosts with negative weight), and
for both sets of elds, the average mass squared per degree of freedom is exactly the geodesic
distance (25). we have now seen that the geodesic distance criterion is precisely realized in
the proposed multi-d0-brane action.

3.2 graviton interactions

in this section, we use the general background matrix theory action to study the interactions
between two gravitons with unit momentum around a lightlike circle in a weakly curved
space. in various cases, we will compute the one-loop eective action to rst order in the
metric and compare with the interactions expected from dlcq supergravity with a curved
background.

the relevant matrix theory action and background are exactly the same as those consid-
ered for d0-branes in the previous section. in this case, however, we do not wish to restrict
to gravitons which are xed in the transverse space, so we allow ~r to be a function of time.
as for the case of at space matrix theory, we should require that our background matrices
satisfy the equations of motion. for block diagonal backgrounds, the equations of motion
decouple for each block, so for our case, we require that ~r(t) satisfy the equations of motion
derived from the u(1) action (8). for a metric which is non-trivial only in the transverse
directions, the equations of motion are

ri = rk rlgim(~r){

1
2

mgkl(~r)  kgml(~r)}

(28)

this is just the equation for a free non-relativistic particle moving in a curved space.
we will consider two simple cases of trajectories which trivially satisfy these equations of
motion. first, we may consider the static case ~r(t) = ~r(0). the second case is one for which
the metric has a at direction i (so that hij = igjk = 0) and we take the particle to have
some velocity in this direction. in this case, the right hand side of (28) vanishes, so that
ri(t) = ri + vit.

3.2.1 supergravity predictions

before proceeding with the matrix theory calculation, we would like to see what supergravity
predicts for the interaction potential between two gravitons in a weakly curved space.

as above, we start with a static metric gij(~x) = ij + hij(~x) which is assumed to satisfy

the source-free einstein equations

0 = rij =

1
2

(hij  ikhkj  jkhki + ijhkk) + o(h2)

(29)

we may nd the potential between a pair of gravitons in this space by treating one as a
source for a perturbation about the metric g and reading o the potential from the probe
action (8), keeping only terms arising from the perturbation in the original metric due to
the presence of the source graviton.

for our source, we choose the graviton which sits at the origin of the transverse space
with unit momentum in the compact direction. the stress-energy tensor for this particle
still has only a single non-vanishing component,

t ++ = t =

1

2r2 (~x),

the presence of this graviton will result in a perturbation of the metric gij which we denote
by ij. the fact that t is the only non-vanishing component of the stress-energy tensor
simplies things considerably, and as with the at space case, we may solve the einstein
equation taking only the component  to be non-zero. in this case, the condition that
the perturbed metric g +  should continue to satisfy the einstein equation with source t
reduces at leading order in  to the covariant laplace equation,

gijij = gij(ij  k

ijk) = 22

11t

(30)

(see, for example [29]). we are only interested in the solution at leading order in h (the
original background metric), so we expand

  0 + 1 + o(h2)

here 0 is the part independent of h, equal to the at space solution (ignoring non-numerical
constants)

0 =

15
2r7

(31)

while 1 is the part linear in h.

in the case where gij is the metric corresponding to some choice of coordinates on at
space, the exact solution to (30) must be given by a covariant version of (31), replacing r
with the geodesic distance d between 0 and r. in this case, using (25), we have

 =

15
2 {

1
r7 

7rirj

2r9 z 1

0

22

dhij(~r)} + o(h2)

(32)

in fact, this solves (30) to leading order in h in any case where the metric g is ricci-at as
may be veried explicitly by substitution. the h independent part of (30) reads

20 = 22

11t,

and is just the statement that 0 is the solution for at space. the linear terms in h in
equation (30) read

21 = hijij0 + (ihik 

khii)k0

1
2

and substituting for 0 and 1 from (32) it is not hard to check that this holds, making use
of the ricci-atness condition (29), the identity

h(~r) = (r  )h(~r),

and various integrations by parts. this is done most easily by choosing coordinates so that
h satises the harmonic gauge condition in which

ihij =

1
2

jhii, rij = 2hij + o(h2)

.

thus, to leading order in the backgrounds we are considering, the metric perturbation

due to the presence of a graviton at the origin is simply

(~x) =

15

2d7(~x)

where d is the geodesic distance between 0 and ~x. recalling the action (8) for the probe
graviton moving in the metric produced by this source, we see that to leading order in the
background, the curved space graviton-graviton potential is simply

v = 

15
16

v4
d7

in the next sections, we will carry out the graviton potential calculation in matrix theory to
compare with this supergravity prediction.

3.2.2 static case

first, we consider the static case in which both gravitons have zero transverse velocity. in
this case, as in at space, we expect the potential to vanish at leading order in the transverse
metric, as shown above.

for this case, we may directly apply the results of section 3.1. the complete action

quadratic in the o diagonal elds is

s = sb + sa + sf + sg

23

sb = zi{(2

sa = z0{2
sf =  {it + i
sg = c{2
t + r2}c

t + r2)(ij + hij)
+(rkrlhkl)ij  rirkhkj  hikrkrj}zj
t + r2 + rirjhij}z0

(ri +

1
2

hijrj}

(33)

as argued above, this leads to eight complex bosons (including the gauge eld) and
sixteen real fermions with masses equal to the geodesic distance between 0 and ~r as well as
rr + hrihir) and

complex bosons with m2 = r2(1 + qh 2

two complex ghosts with m2 = r2.

rr + hrihir) and m2 = r2(1  qh 2

the vanishing of the one loop potential to leading order in h is ensured by the fact that
the sum of the squared masses weighted by number of degrees of freedom is identical for
the fermions and bosons (including ghosts weighted by -1). this follows since the one loop
eective action depends only on the oscillator masses and is given by:

ei1loop = det 8(2
det 1(2
= 1 + o(h2)

t + r2(1 + hrr)) det 8(2
t + r2(1 +qh 2

t + r2(1 + hrr)) det 2(2

t + r2)
t + r2(1 qh 2

rr + hrihir)) det 1(2

rr + hrihir))

hence, in the static case, we nd agreement with our expectations from supergravity.

3.2.3 velocity dependent potential

we now consider the case of two gravitons with relative velocity. here, we assume that the
particle with initial position ~r moves in a direction ~v which is perpendicular to ~r and in
which the metric is at.
in this case, we have shown above that supergravity predicts a
potential


where d is the geodesic separation distance.

15v4
16d7

to simplify our calculations, we rotate coordinates so that ~r and ~v lie in coordinate

directions which we denote by indices r and v. thus

gvv(~x) = 1, gvr(~x) = gvi(~x) = vgij(~x) = 0

these equations ensure that the matrix theory equations of motion (28) are satised for
the trajectory ~r(t) = ~r + ~vt that we are considering. expanding the action (33) about this
background, we nd that the quadratic action for the o diagonal elds is equal to the action
for the static case (where ri is interpreted as ri(t) = ri + vit) plus extra terms:

sv = 2iziviz0  2iz0vizi

24

note that these terms (in which the background appears as ~r rather than just ~r) come only
x i only appears coupled to
from the at space action, since in the metric dependent terms,
hij while rihij = 0. as a result, the remaining calculation is almost identical to the at space
calculation, performed in [17]. to see this, we note that the complete action in this case may
be written (eliminating a factor (ij + hij) as above to diagonalize the boson kinetic term)

s = sb + sa + sv + sf + sg
t + d2 + v2t2)}zi
sb = zi{(2
+zr{r2hri}zi + zi{r2hir}zr + zv{hrirvt}zi + zi{hirrvt}zv
t + d2 + v2t2}z0

sa = z0{2
sv = 2iziviz0  2iz0vizi
sf =  {it + i
t + d2}c
sg = c{2
+c{hrr}c

(di + vit)}

where we have dened

di = ri +

1
2

hijrj

so that d2 is the squared geodesic distance. apart from the terms with explicit factors of
h in the boson and ghost actions, this is exactly the at space action with ri replaced by
di. recalling the at space calculation, we see that at zeroth order in h, the oscillators
zi, i = 1,   , 7, and zr are degenerate with mass d2 + v2t2 while zv and z0 combine into
oscillators with non-degenerate masses (d2 + v2t2  2v). adding the perturbation

zr{r2hri}zi + zi{r2hir}zr + zv{hrirvt}zi + zi{hirrvt}zv

(34)

we note that the last two terms do not aect the masses at leading order in h, since if
we change coordinates to diagonalize the leading order mass matrix, these contribute only
to non-diagonal matrix elements connecting eigenvectors of dierent mass.
(recall from
basic perturbation theory that for eigenvectors |a1i,  |ani with degenerate zeroth order
eigenvalues and eigenvectors |b1i,  |bmi with non-degenerate zeroth order eigenvalues that
the rst order shift in the eigenvalues for |bii come only from the matrix element hbi|m|bii,
while the rst order eigenvalues for the space spanned by |aii are determined only by the
submatrix hai|m|aji).

the rst two terms in (34) have the same eect as they did in the static case, to shift

two of the degenerate boson masses by

m2 = hrr qh 2

 hrr  g

rr + hrihir

meanwhile, the perturbation in the ghost action shifts the two ghost masses by

m2

g = hrr
25

dening

f (x) = det(2

t + (d2  x) + v2t2)

we nd that since all of the mass shifts are time independent, the one loop eective action
is simply

f (hrr)f (hrr)

f (hrr + g)f (hrr  g)

ei = eid

= eid(1 + o(h2))

where d is the at-space potential with r replaced by the geodesic length d. we conclude
that the leading order one loop potential is simply given by

v =

as predicted by supergravity.

4 discussion

in this paper we have derived the leading terms in the multiple d0-brane action in a weakly
curved background metric, dilaton, and antisymmetric tensor background elds. this action
was derived by using seibergs scaling arguments on an action we recently proposed for the
m(atrix) model of m-theory in weak background elds. we found explicit forms for the
iia stress-energy tensor of a multiple d0-brane system, as well as the components of d2-
brane, d4-brane, d6-brane and fundamental string currents which couple to the background
r-r and b elds of the iia theory. we tested our action by verifying that it satises
douglass geodesic length criterion. we also showed that the corrections to the one-loop
eective potential between a pair of individual 0-branes correctly reproduce curved space
supergravity results.

the results presented in this paper give for the rst time a systematic description of the
linear coupling between a system of multiple d-branes and background supergravity elds.
there are a number of previous discussions of this sort of action in the literature to which
our results can be related. in [28], douglas, kato and ooguri used douglass geodesic length
criterion and other axioms including an assumption of supersymmetry to constrain the form
of the multiple d3-brane action on a transverse kahler manifold. they compute the rst
few correction terms in terms of the curvature tensor rijkl of the background. they show
that the rst term, corresponding to our coupling

(k1k2hij)i ij(k1k2)

h

(35)

is uniquely determined by the geodesic length criterion. the linear part of the term they nd
indeed has the same form 2htr x 2(f 2 + x 2) as our result for this term. their approach
is not able to uniquely determine the higher order terms, but our results are compatible

26

with the general structure of the linear parts of the structure they nd at higher order. it
is interesting that they are able to determine the form of some of the quadratic couplings in
their work as well as the linear terms.

it is natural to try to extend the results of this paper to determine the quadratic and
higher order couplings between a system of many d-branes and the supergravity background
elds. in [13] it was suggested that the coupling to nth order terms in the background could
be determined by a n-loop calculation in matrix theory. the results of okawa and yoneya on
3-graviton scattering in matrix theory [30, 31] seem to indicate that this may work at least to
quadratic order in general backgrounds, although there are indications [32, 33, 34] that there
may be problems with extending this approach to higher order. in any case, even the two-
loop calculation would be quite challenging to work out for completely general background
congurations, so it would be nice to nd a simpler approach. the terms coupling the
open string elds of the d-brane system to any number of bulk supergravity elds can of
course in principle be determined by a perturbative string calculation. these calculations
are quite complicated, however, even for the linear coupling terms discussed in this paper.
(for recent work computing the curvature squared terms in the single d-brane action see
[35]). furthermore, the results we have given here extend to arbitrary derivatives in the
background elds and contain a correspondingly arbitrary number of d-brane elds. it is
dicult to imagine reproducing such results from perturbative string theory. despite these
diculties inherent in a systematic derivation of the higher order coupling terms, it may be
that the symmetries of the theory and the geodesic length criterion are sucient to determine
the structure of some of the higher-order terms. the results of [28] on kahler manifolds
indicate that it is indeed possible to learn something about about the higher order terms
using this approach. in this paper we have found that the combinatorial structure of the
higher moment terms is crucial in xing the masses of o-diagonal strings in accord with the
geodesic length criterion. this indicates that this condition will place strong constraints on
the possible form of the higher order couplings to the background. another approach which
might help extend the results here to higher order is to nd the symmetry principle which
corresponds to general coordinate invariance for the multiple d0-brane system. because
the coordinates enter the theory as matrices, there are ordering ambiguities in determining
how the operators describing the d0-brane system transform.
if this symmetry could be
understood in a systematic fashion, it would quite possibly uniquely determine the higher
order couplings of the multiple d-brane system to general backgrounds.

the approach we have taken here to describing matrix theory and multiple d0-brane
systems in curved backgrounds is to assume that the action in a weak background can be
written as a matrix quantum mechanics theory with a systematic expansion in powers of the
background eld strength. this approach certainly seems valid for linear couplings to the
background. it is not clear, however, that such an approach can be extended to all orders. in
[36, 37], in fact, it was argued that even on simple manifolds like k3 or ale spaces it may not
be possible to describe dlcq m-theory using a nite size matrix quantum mechanics theory.

27

we are not sure at this point how the approach we have taken here ts with the results of
those papers. one possibility is that the perturbation expansion we are considering in powers
of the background eld will not converge to a well-dened theory when higher order terms
are taken into account and the background is of the form considered in [36, 37]. indeed, the
results of those papers indicate that the expansion in weak backgrounds may break down at
quadratic order in the curvature of the background1. another possibility is that either the
restriction to light-front coordinates in m-theory or the fact that in the seiberg limit the
scale of the metric structures of interest becomes smaller than the string length may have
a subtle eect on the relationship between the supergravity and open string descriptions of
graviton interactions, leading to some modication in the conclusions of [36, 37]. it is clearly
a very important question whether a good low-energy description of d0-branes can be given
which maps to m-theory in the seiberg limit, but we leave a further resolution of this issue
to further work.

in this paper we have focused on the action for a system of d0-branes in a weak super-
gravity background. it is possible, however, to t-dualize the action we have given here to
get an action for dp-branes of arbitrary dimension in a weak background. one particularly
interesting case is that of d3-branes. the t-duals of the currents ix we have determined in
this paper are linear combinations of the operators in the n = 4, d = 3+1 super yang-mills
theory on the world volume of a system of many d3-branes which lie in the short represen-
tations of the su(2, 2|4) superconformal symmetry group of the theory. these operators,
which couple linearly to the supergravity background elds, play a crucial role in the sim-
plest version of maldacenas ads/cft correspondence [38]. for the elds associated with
the lowest partial waves of bulk elds in the ads space, some of the corresponding operators
were found from the born-infeld action in [39, 40, 41, 42]. all the other lowest partial wave
operators are in principle determined by supersymmetry and group theory from the weight
2 operator tr x (ix j), following [43, 44, 45, 46] and related work. although these operators
have played a fundamental role in understanding the detailed structure of the ads/cft
correspondence, only a few of these operators have been described explicitly in terms of
the component elds in the d3-brane world-volume theory. in addition, to date no general
method for understanding the structure of the higher partial wave operators (which corre-
spond to the higher moments of our currents i ()
through t-duality and which are related
through supersymmetry to the higher weight chiral primary operators tr x {i1    x ik}) has
been presented in the literature, although some discussion of particular operators of this
type was given in, for example, [40, 47]. in a separate paper we will discuss more details of
the connection between the results presented here and the operators which are used in the
ads/cft correspondence for 3-branes.

x

a feature which emerges from the results of [14, 15, 13] and the extension of this work in
the present paper is the characteristic form of the higher moments of the currents ix which
couple to the derivatives of the background supergravity elds. in general, we nd that the

i (i1in)
x

= sym (ix; x i1, x i2, . . . x in) + i (i1in)

x(fermion)

(36)

where the rst term on the rhs is a bosonic contribution to the higher moment given by
a symmetrized trace of the polynomial giving the monopole moment of ix with a product
of n xs, and the second term contains fermionic contributions to the higher moment. the
fact that all the monopole moments of the currents as well as their higher moments can be
expressed in a symmetrized trace form is reminiscent of tseytlins suggestion [8] for using
the symmetrized trace to resolve ordering ambiguities in the nonabelian born-infeld action.
indeed, the components t  of the 11d stress tensor are precisely the symmetrized f 4
terms appearing at fourth order in the nonabelian born-infeld action proposed by tseytlin.
this structure may be helpful in trying to predict the form of higher-order terms in the
action without doing explicit matrix theory or string theory calculations. this structure
is also helpful in understanding previous work in which higher partial waves of operators
on the d3-brane play a role. in particular, in [40] the rate of absorption of higher partial
waves of minimally coupled scalars in an extremal d3-brane background was computed in
supergravity and compared to a d3-brane world-volume calculation. while the analogous
calculations for s-wave absorption can be matched precisely including numerical coecients,
for partial waves with l > 1 a discrepancy was found in [40] between the results of these two
calculations. the authors suggested that this discrepancy might arise because the higher
partial wave operators were not correctly normalized. the results we have given here suggest
by t-duality that they indeed used the correct normalization, but that the operators they
used should have a symmetrized trace with respect to orderings of the elds. this additional
information seems to help resolve the discrepancy found in [40]2. a more detailed discussion
of the resolution of this problem will be described in a future publication.
