(1) = conventionally one takes p = 1/e2, q = /(2e2). reason considered arbitrary become clear proceed. model linearised 2 via auxiliary eld b lf = i( iea ib) 1 2g | b |2 pe2 4 | |2 + qe2 2 aa. (2) one loop bosonization large fermion mass limit yields bosonic lagrangian (to o(1/m)), lb = 4 cc + 2 c c 1 2g bb pe2 4 aa + qe2 2 aa. (3) c = b + ea, = 1/(8) = 1/(6m). u(1) gauge invariance present (1) clearly visible regards eld. (gauge) b (matter) eld equations are, ac + c + epa + = 0. 2 eq 2 two equations combined give ac + 2 c 1 g b = 0. 1 g b + epa + eq 2 = 0. (4) (5) (6) notice without gauge eld kinetic terms parent fermion model, would obtained simply b = 0. lagrangian (3) master lagrangian {$9901051$}. upon selective integration one interacting elds turn, dierent equivalent (dual) theories reproduced apparantly distinct. way, possible connect dierent well known theories. duality appears form particle spectrum, symmetry, greens function e.t.c.. next task integrate gauge eld. iii. particle spectrum: lagrangian framework modulo total derivative terms, integration lorentz gauge gives {$9901051$}, lb(b) = b ap(a+p) 8 ( p+a 2 + 1 2(p2 + q2a) 2 )22 + (q + )2 (g2 )b + b (p2+qa2) 2 + q( + q) 4 2 )22 + (q + )2 ( p+a b 1 2g bb. (7) equation motion b ap(a+p) 8 ( p+a 2 + 1 2(p2 + q2a) 2 )22 + (q + )2 (g2 )b 3 + (p2+qa2) 2 + q( + q) 4 2 )22 + (q + )2 ( p+a b 1 2g b. (8) clearly b obeys current conservation, (b = 0), required fermion current. dening dual b b = b, 1 2 obtain two equations lagrangian (3) compact notation as, a(b) d2b = 0, a(b) + d(b) = 0, lb(b) = bab + bdb. non-local operators are, ap(a+p) 8 ( p+a 2 + 1 2(p2 + q2a) 2 )22 + (q + )2 2 1 2g , 2 (p2+qa2) 2 + q( + q) 4 2 )22 + (q + )2 ( p+a . combining equations (9), get (a2 + d22)b = 0. (9) (10) (11) (12) unfortunately complicated nature operators prohibit study eld equa- tion. let us consider approximations mentioned before. keeping within approximations involved bosonization scheme drop o(a2) terms. however, nonvanishing p, (that presence maxwell term (1)), non-local nature eective theory persists. present case avoid problem putting p = 0 keep chern simons term (1). operators become, ( q2a 2(q + )2 2 1 2g ), 2q q + . hence b equation reduces b = 0. equation factorised following form , (2 + 2 +)(2 + 2 )b = 0. two values eective mass parameter 2 = (q + )2 q2a . ) 4 (13) (14) (15) (16) substituting local expressions d, arrive mcsp model neglecting o(a2) terms analysis dropped o(a2) terms. contradic- tion since studying mcsp model such, forgetting originated rst place. however, persist a2 0 (14), end single massive mode, (2 + 2)b = 0, 2 (q + )2 16q22g2 (1 + 82g ). concludes lagrangian analysis mcsp model. iv. particle spectrum: hamiltonian framework start mcsp lagrangian, using (13), l = p bb + qbb + rbb. (17) where, p = q2a 4(q + )2 , q = 2q q + , r = 1 2g . conjugate momenta canonical hamiltonian dened standard way, = l b , h = b l. explicit expressions are, 0 = 0, = 4p (ib0 bi) qijbj, h = 1 8p ( + qijbj)2 + b0(ii qijibj) p bijbij rbb. (18) (19) (20) perform constraint analysis obtaining constraints subsequently com- puting dirac brackets. aim obtain equations motion modes reproduce spectra obtained (16). primary constraint 1(x) 0(x) 0, (21) time persistence generates secondary constraint 2(x) 1(x) =  = ii(x) 2rb0(x) qijibj(x) 0. (22) brackets obtained using fundamental poisson brackets  = g (x y). constraints constitute second class pair non-trivial algebra,  =  = 0,  = 2r(x y). (23) 5 inverse constraint matrix ij, dened r d2ycij(x, y)jk(y, z) = gik(x z) non zero element generates nontrivial dirac brackets c12(x, y) = 1 2r (x y).  = 1 2r i(x y),  = q 2r ijj(x y). (24) rest brackets altered. always use dirac brackets. b0 bi bracket recovers correct schwinger term fermion current algebra,  =  = 0,  = 1 g i(x y). (25) strong implementation constraints h (20) simplies h = 1 8p (i + qijbj)2 p b2 ij + r(b2 0 + b2 ). time derivative b0 reproduces current conservation, b0(x) =  = ibi(x). (26) (27) current algebra conservation equation two main results. note dirac brackets crucial recovering them. rederive particle spectrum. first compute following time derivatives, bi = 1 4p (i + qijbj) + ib0, = q 4p (jij + qbi) 4p jbij qijjb0 + 2rbi. take time derivatives equations, bi = 1 4p ( + qij bj) + b0, = q 4p (ji j + q bi) 4p j bij qijj b0 + 2r bi. long algebra yields following set equations, (28) (29) (30) bi = q 8p 2 ijj, q2 4p q 2p i = 2qijj(kbk) + )ijbj + 2qikjjbk 2qi(jkjbk). (31) constraints used strongly. operator arising left hand side equations used get (2r 2bi = q2 16p 3 (2r q2 4p )]bi. (32) 6 identical equation appears well. chain derivatives diagonalizes equa- tions motion. factorising (32), obtain identical set expressions given (16). concludes hamiltonian analysis. substituting known expressions get explicit forms masses, 2 = 24e4m 2 ( 1 8 + 2e2 )2. ) expanding square root powers (1/m), get 2 + 48e4m 2 ( 1 8 + 2e2 )2( 3m 4 + 1 g ), 2 162e4 2g2 ( 1 8 + 2e2 )2. (33) (34) interestingly, m+ >> since independent fermion mass m, large parameter. since spin particles determined sign mass , small value lead spinless particle. v. conclusions hamiltonian lagrangian mcs proca model performed, full spectra modes revealed. interest model lies fact model derived bosonized version u(1) gauged massive thirring model. since bosonic vector eld fermion current identied, bosonized model, turn mcs proca model, yields properties fermion counterpart. non-trivial application above, computed correctly fermion current algebra, schwinger term, staying mcs proca model framework. behaviour fermionic composite objects, constructed fermion currents, also studied mcs proca model, quantum eects enter via process bosonization. acknowledgment: grateful professor s. dutta gupta, director, s. n. bose national centre basic sciences, calcutta, allowing use institution facilities. 7
