gauge group constrained theory is, massless massive cases, group = /u(1), although, massive case, polarization subgroup tp consistently imposed constraint. also case virasoro algebra (12) string theory, appearance central terms spoil gauge invariance forces us impose half virasoro operators (the positive modes ln0) constraints. thus, spontaneous breakdown gauge symmetry group manifests non-trivial transformations phase wave functional action , leading appearance new internal eld degrees freedom modify eld mass content vector potentials a, depending choice mass-matrix elements = 2 tr(t i). situation recalls important physical implications geometric phases (namely, berrys phase) quantum mechanics, case discussed present paper particular one. words, presence mass detected wave functional gauge excursions conguration space, happens presence monopoles (see ref.  discussion emergence gauge structures h-connection generalized spin quantizing coset space g/h). also, zeroes (critical values) mass-matrix elements correspond dierent phases physical system characterized corresponding unbroken gauge symmetry tc;
