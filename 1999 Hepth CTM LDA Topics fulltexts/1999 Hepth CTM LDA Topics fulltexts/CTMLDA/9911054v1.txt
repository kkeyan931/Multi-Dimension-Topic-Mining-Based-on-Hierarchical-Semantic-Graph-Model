geodesic flow on the n-dimensional ellipsoid as a liouville

integrable system

abstract

we show that the motion on the n-dimensional ellipsoid is complete integrable
by exihibiting n integrals in involution. the system is separable at classical and
quantum level, the separation of classical variables being realized by the inverse of
the momentum map. this system is a generic one in a new class of n-dimensional
complete integrable hamiltonians dened by an arbitrary function f (q, p) invertible
with respect to momentum p and rational in the coordinate q.

complete integrable hamiltonian systems in the liouville sense are a main sub-
ject of interest in the last decades both at classical as well as quantum level. classical
examples of such systems are the geodesic ow on the triaxial ellipsoid, neumannns
dynamical system and the integrable cases of the rigid body motion. the number of
interesting examples increased after the seminal papers by lax [1] and by olshanet-
ski and peremolov [2], especially in connection with the inverse scattering method
and the relation with classical simple lie algebras.

the aim of this paper is the study of the geodesic motion on the n-dimensional
ellipsoid, which is a direct generalization of the 2-dimensional case studied by jacobi
[3], since it seems that no solution is known for this system in the case n > 2 . we
obtain a complete description of the problem at the classical level by nding n
prime integrals in involution, the separation of variables, the explicit solution of the
hamilton-jacobi equation and the equations of geodesics. we also show that the
schrodinger equation separates. this system is to a great extent universal among
the various integrable systems and generates a new class of completely integrable
models.

unconstrained form with canonical poisson brackets. in the following we will use a
third way, the classical one, which consists in reducing the lagrangean by eliminat-
ing one degree of freedom [5] using the equation of constraint (1). the simplest way
to do that would be to resolve eq.(1) with respect to the last coordinate and use it
in the free lagrangean, eq.(2), but the drawback is that we obtain a non-diagonal
metric. we follow here the jacobi idea which was to nd a clever parametrization
such that the coresponding metric should be diagonal [3, 6].

for what follows it is useful to dene two polynomials

p (x) =

n+1

(x  ai)

yi=1

q(x) =

n

yi=1
(x  ui)

(3)

where ai and ui, i = 1, . . . , n are the positive numbers entering the parametriza-
tion of the ellipsoid and the ellipsoidal coordinates, respectively. the orthogonal
parametrization of the quadric (1) is given by [7]

j =

aj q(aj)
p (aj)

,

j = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1

(4)

where p (aj) = d p (x)/d x|x=aj , and the ellipsoidal coordinates u1, . . . , un satisfy
a1 < u1 < a2 < . . . < un < an+1. using this parametrisation in eq.(2) we nd

where the (diagonal) metric is given by gii = ui q(ui)/p (ui) , i = 1, 2, . . . , n, and
q(ui) = d q(x)/d x|x=ui . dening as usual the generalized momenta by pi =

where h1 diers from h by a numerical factor. a careful inspection of the eqs.(8)
shows that for each degree of freedom the contribution to the hamiltonian hk
is given by the product of two dierent factors. the rst one depends on the

let g(p, u) = h(p, u) be an arbitrary function depending on the canonical vari-
ables p and u which is invertible with respect to the momentum p. as we will see
later the invertibility condition is necessary for the separation of variables in the
hamilton-jacobi equation. in particular we may suppose that h(p, u) is an one-
dimensional hamiltonian. for each n  n we dene an n-dimensional integrable
model by giving n integrals in involution

our main result is contained in the following proposition.

proposition.let m 2n  t (rn) be the canonically symplectic phase space of

the dynamical system dened by the hamilton function eq.(6). then
i) the functions hi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n are in involution

ii) the momentum map is given by

{hi, hj} = 0,

i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n

e : m 2n  rn : mh = {(ui, pi) : hi = hi,

i = 1, 2, . . . , n}, hi  r

then e1(mh) realizes the separation of variables giving an explicit factorisation of
liouvilles tori into one-dimensional ovals
iii) canonical equations are integrable by quadratures

in the following we sketch a proof of the above proposition. as it will be easily

seen the same proof is also true for the hamiltonians dened in eqs.(8).

the last step was possible because the symmetric functions s(j)

where the upper index (i, j) means that the corresponding expression does not

and resolving it with respect to pi is equivalent to the calculation of the following

which is equal to the vandermonde determinant, i.e.

vn = y1i<jn

(uj  ui)

let v (j)
n1 be the determinant obtained by removing the jth column and the last
row in vn and wn,j the determinant obtained by replacing the jth column of vn by
(h1, . . . , hn)t. it is easily seen that

v (j)

(10)

which shows that e1(mh) is a n-dimensional submanifold of m 2 n and more impor-
tant p2
i are functions which depend only on the variable ui. the last relation shows

that the application e1(mh) realizes the separation of variables for the geodesic
motion on the ellipsoid.
for the hamiltonians given by eqs.(8) the preceding equations have the form

g(pi, ui) =

i

i = 1, 2 . . . , n

(10)

the relations (10-10) have the classical form [8]

(xi, pi, h1, . . . , hn) = 0

i = 1, 2 . . . , n

which is an explicit factorization of liouvilles tori into one-dimensional ovals. this
is important for the quantization problem.

with the notation r(u) =pn1

k=0 hnk uk the above relations can be written

pi = is ui r(ui)

p (ui)

,

i = 1, . . . , n

pi = g1(r(ui)),

i = 1, . . . , n

where i = 1 and g1 is the inverse of the relation (10) with respect to the
momentum p. the last relations allow immediately to resolve the hamilton-jacobi
equation because in this case the action splits into a sum of terms

s(h, u1, . . . , un) = s1(h, u1) + . . . + sn(h, un)

each of them satisfying an ordinary dierential equation. only the solution of the
hamilton-jacobi equation for the geodesic motion on the ellipsoid will be presented
the other more general case being similar.

iii) the above formulae allows us to choose new canonical variables as follows
q1 = h1,qk = hk, k = 2, . . . , n and the corresponding variables pi, i = 1, . . . , n.
the hamilton equations take the form

qi = 0,
p1 = 1,

i = 1, . . . , n

pi = 0, i = 2, . . . , n

and therefore qi = hi, i = 1, . . . , n and p1 = t + g1, pk = gk, k = 2, . . . , n, with
gi, hi  r, i = 1, . . . , n.

because

which gives the implicit equations of the geodesics. in this way the integration of
the hamilton equations was reduced to quadratures. on the last expressions one
can see that all the subtleties of the geodesic motion on the n-dimensional ellipsoid
are encoded by the hyperelliptic curve y2 = p (x) r(x) whose genus is g = n.

for quantization we use both the forms (9) and (10) and show rst that the
quantization of h1 is equivalent to the quantization of eq.(10). it is well known
that because of the ambiguities concerning the ordering of p and u we must use
the laplace-beltrami operator [9]. its general form is n = 1g pi(g gijpj), i, j =
1, . . . , n, where g = det(gij ) and gij is the metric tensor. taking into account that

gii = ui q(ui)/p (ui) = (1)ni vn
v (i)

after some simplications the schrodinger equation generated by the hamiltonian
h1 is written in the following form

which is equivalent with n indepedent equations of the form

here c1 = h1 and the other ck are arbitrary. the direct approach, starting from
eq.(10), is simpler the problem being one-dimensional and one arrives at the same
equation, eq.(11). it has the advantage that the arbitrary coecients ck are iden-
tied to ck = hk, i.e. ck are the eigenvalues of the hamiltonians hk.

the eq.(11) has the general form of a sturm-liouville problem

dx (cid:19) + v(x)f (x) =  r(x)f (x)

which has to be resolved on an interval [a, b]. it is well known that its eigenfunctions
will live in a hilbert space i p(x) r(x) > 0 on [a, b].
if p(x) has a continuous
rst derivative and p(x) r(x) a continuous second derivative, then by the following
coordinate and function transforms

 =z u(cid:18) r(x)

p(x)(cid:19)1/2

dx,  = (r(u)p(u))1/4 f (u)

(12)

the preceding equation takes the standard form

d2
d2 + q() = 



where

q() =




()
() 

v(u)
r(u)

, () = (p(u) r(u))1/4

and u = u() is the solution of the jacobi inverse problem (12).

in our case, eq.(11), the transformation is

 =z u

u0 (cid:18) u r(u)

p (u) (cid:19)1/2

du

and the schrodinger equation has the form

d2
d2 +






()
()

 = h1

(13)

where () = (r(u()))1/4 and in r(u) we made the rescaling hk  hk/h1, k =
1, . . . , n. thus we have obtained that the solving of the schrodinger equation (11)
is equivalent to the solving of the motion of one-dimensional particle in a potential
generated by r(u()).

for n = 1 eq.(13) is the equation of the one-dimensional rotator

d2
d2 + l2 = 0

with the solution () = 12
ei l , l  z, etc. in all the other cases we have to make
use of the theory of hyperelliptic curves, -functions and/or hyperelliptic abelian
functions in order to obtain explicit solutions. this problem will be treated else-
where. what is remarkable is that the solving of the classical problem, or the solving
of the associated schrodinger equation leads to the use of the same mathematical
formalism, -functions or hyperelliptic kleinian functions.

however there is a simpler alternative to eq.(13), namely by the change of

variable

the eq.(11) takes the form

 =z u s t

p (t)

dt

d2

d2 + n1
xk=0

hnk u()k!  = 0

7

which is the equation of a particle moving in a potential generated by the integrals
in involution.

as concerns the quantization of the hamiltonian h 1 it depends on its explicit

form and we do not pursue it here.

from the proof of our results it follows that the hyperelliptic curve was only a
tool in obtaining the separation of variables eq.(10); in fact the separation was a
direct consequence of the properties of the vandermonde determinant.

in the following we exibit a few examples of new n-dimensional integrable mod-
els. two models which show that the dimension n of the system has no direct
connection with the number of zeros and/or poles of the function g(p, u) could
be: g(p, u) = (sin u/u) p2 and g(p, u) = tg u e  p, the rst example being a func-
tion with a denumerable number of zeros and the second one with a denumer-
able number of poles and zeros, in both cases the hyperelliptic curve being of in-
nite genus. other examples are deduced for example from the many-body elliptic
calogero-moser [10], or the elliptic ruijenaars models [11]. starting with the corre-
sponding one-dimensional hamiltonians hcm (p, u) = f (p, u) = p2/2 + 2 (u) and

fr(p, u) = cosh( p)p1  2 ()2 (u) respectively, where  (u) is the weierstrass

function, we obtain n-dimensional models.

in conclusion we discovered in this paper a new class of complete integrable sys-
tems which allows to uncover the origin of their integrability or solvability property.
we have shown that there is a simple and general mechanism allowing us to con-
struct complete integrable hamiltonian systems with an arbitrary number of degree
of freedom, and for all these systems the separation of classical variables is given by
the inverse of the momentum map.
