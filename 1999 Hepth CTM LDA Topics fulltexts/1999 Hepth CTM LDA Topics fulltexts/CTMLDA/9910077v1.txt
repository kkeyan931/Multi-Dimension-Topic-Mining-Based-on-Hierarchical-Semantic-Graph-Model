abstract

we construct p-brane solutions with non-trivial world volume metrics and
show that applied to supergravity theories, they will necessaryly lead to
threshold bps bound states of intersecting solutions. however applied to
certain specic values of the couplings in cosmological (a, b)-models non-
trivial solutions can be constructed.

1. introduction

it is very well known that supergravity theories have solutions in the form of
extended object, the so-called p-branes [1]. they appear as solitonic objects
that couple to the metric g, dilaton  and (p + 1)-form gaue elds c of the
theory [2]. in general they are of the following form:

ds2 = h mndxmdxn  h ijdyidyj ,
e2  = h  ,
c01...p =  h 1 ,

(1)

where the parameter , ,  and  are determined by the type of p-brane
and the specic supergravity theory considered. the coordinates xm are the
world volume coordinates and yi the coordinates transverse to the brane.
the above solution generally breaks half of the spacetime supersymmetry.
there have been several attempts to generalise the above solution by trying
to write down more general metrics hij over the transverse space than the
conformally at metric shown above [3, 4]. it was demonstrated that this
can be done as long as the transverse space is ricci-at and that part of the
supersymmetry is preserved in the presence of killing spinors. on the other
hand, in [5] a solution was presented of the near-horizon limit of an m2-brane
wrapped over an arbitrary genus surface.
recently there has been a attempt [6] to generalize the standard d8-brane
solution of [7] by imposing a general metric gmn on the world volume of
the domain wall. also here it was found that the equations of motion and
supersymmetry were satised, provided that the metric gmn is ricci-at and
allows covariantly constant killing spinors.
in this letter we want to give a general analysis and try to construct ex-
plicitely such solutions. we will show that for standard supergravity the-
ories, i.e.
in the absence of a cosmological constant, these solutions exist,
but necesaryly always can be seen as solutions made out of intersecting
branes. however, curved p-branes can be used to construct solutions to
general einstein-maxwell-dilaton theory with a cosmological constant, the
so-calles cosmological (a, b)-models, for specic values of the couplings a and
b. these theories in general are not supersymmetric. nevertheless, it is in-
teresting to see how curved branes t into this setup to provide a new class
of solutions.
the organisation of this letter is as follows:
in section 2 we will set our
notation by giving a general ansatz for curved p-brane and compute the

2

various curvature tensors of our ansatz.
in section 3, we will look at the
equations of motion of the curved p-branes in a general supergravity theory,
reproduce the results of [3, 4, 6] and give explicite solutions satisfying the
conditions. in section 4 we will apply the ansatz to construct solutions to
cosmological (a, b)-models.

2. the curved p-brane ansatz

we start with the following ansatz for the curved p-brane metric in d di-
mensions:

ds2 = h (y)gmn(x)dxmdxn  h (y)h(y)ijdyidyj.

(2)

we allow the internal metric gmn(xm) over the world volume to depend on
the world volume coordinates xm and the transverse space to have a more
general geometry, described by the external metric hij(y). the parameters
 and  are to be choosen such that in the case of at internal and external
metrics (gmn = mn and hij = ij), the standard (at) p-brane solutions (1)
are recovered. in that case the function h(y) is harmonic in the transverse
coordinates: iih = 0.
it is straight forward to compute the ricci tensor and the ricci scalar for the
metric (2):

rmn = rmn  
rim = 0 ,
rij = rij + 

2 gmnh 1 h i ih + ( d    1)( h)2i ,
2 h 1 k kh hij + ( d  )h 1 ijh

+ 

4 (d  p  1)  d( + 1) + 2
r = h  r  h  r  (2 d  )h 1 i ih

2 ( d    1)h 2( h)2 hij
+h 2
4 (p + 1) + 2
h 2

4 (d  p  1) + d( d  2  2) + 2

4 (p + 1) + 2

(3)

2 + ih 2ihjh ,

2 + ih 2( h)2.

here rmn ( rij) and r ( r) are the ricci tensor and the ricci scalar of the
internal (external) metric, p is the number of spatial dimensions of the brane
and

d = 

2 (p + 1) + 

2 (d  p  1).

(4)

3

we denote by i the covariant derivative with respect to the metric hij.
furthermore we have dened

ih = hijjh,

( h)2 = hijihjh .

(5)

note that the overall ricci tensor and ricci scalar (4) factorize into parts
coming from the internal and external metric and a part coming from the
overall metric of the brane.

3. ricci-at branes and intersections

we will now look at the concrete example of a p-brane in supergravity. our
ansatz for the curved p-brane solution is given by:

e2  = h  ,

ds2 = h hgmndxmdxni  h hhijdyidyji ,
c01..p = p|g| h 1 .

(6)

(7)

the extra factor p|g| has been added to the gauge eld ansatz to compen-

sate for the curvature of the internal metric in the equations of motion. the
equation of motion of c is satised if the function h(y) is harmonic on the
external metric hij:

ih = 0 .

i

the einstein and dilaton equations factorize completely into a part coming
from the internal and external metrics and a part that is identical zero, being
the equations of motion of the at p-brane, upto eqn. (7). therefore we
have that:

rmn = 0 ,
rij = 0 ,
h  r  h  r = 0 .

(8)

these are the ricci-atness conditions given in [3, 4, 6]. also the supersym-
metry variations factorize in a part proportional to the projection operator
of the p-brane and the following conditions on  coming from the internal
and external metrics:

m = 0 ,

i = 0 .

(9)

4

the problem now consists of nding (non-trivial) (p + 1) or (d  p  1)-
dimensional ricci-at solutions that preserve some part of their supersym-
metry. to our knowlegde, there are only two such solutions: the kaluza-klein
monopole [8] and the gravitational wave [9].
choosing for the internal metric gmn the four-dimensional gravitational wave,
the generalized p-brane (6) takes the form:

ds2 = h h(2  f )dt2  f dz2  2(1  f )dtdz  dx2

ai  h d~y2

e2  = h  ,
c01...p = h 1 .

(10)

this solution satises the equations of motion if the functions f and h are
harmonic in xa and yi respectively and preserves one quarter of supersym-
metry. however it is not dicult to see that this is actually the solution of
a theshold bps intersection of a p-brane and a ten-dimensional wave in its
world volume [10, 11] (in the notation of [12]):

: h
: f .

(11)

(1|p,w) = (cid:26)          
 z        
| {z }t,z
}

{z

{z

|

also the inclusion of a kaluza-klein monopole in the transverse space will
lead to a known threshold bps intersection of a p-brane and a monopole
[10, 11, 12]

(p|p,kk) = (cid:26)        


      z a1 a2 a3



.

(12)

the dependence of the harmonic functions h and f (in the language of inter-
secting branes, on the overall transverse and relative transverse coordinates
respectively, i.e. the gravitational wave delocalised in its overall transverse
directions) is the correct one to belong to the class of threshold bps bound
states [13].
a logical next step would be trying to weaken the ricci-atness condition
by exciting other elds with dependences on the world volume coordinates
(for example excite a u(1) gauge eld and construct a extreme reissner-
nordstrom solution on the world volume). however, these generalisations
turn out to be impossible: adding extra gauge elds or dilaton with de-
pendence on the world volume coordinates inevitably leads to terms in the

5

equations of motion which cannot be cancelled. for example adding a dilaton
  (x) will lead in the einstein equations to a term
h 1ih m ,

 = n

(13)

im

imn  =

4

which clearly cannot be cancelled by other terms. it would be interesting to
see whether the ricci-atness condition can be circumvented by coupling a
curved p-brane to a world volume action and let the born-infeld eld on the
d-brane play the role of u(1) gauge eld of an extreme reissner-nordstrom
solution.

4. cosmological (a, b)-models

as was pointed out in the previous section, the ricci-atness condition is a
quite strong restriction that necesarily leads to threshold bps bound state
intesections of p-branes with gravitational waves or monopoles.
however, if one forgets for one moment the ricci-atness condition imposed
by the rst two equations of (8), the dilaton equation admits a more general
solution:

r =  ,

r =  h 

(14)

where  is an arbitrary constant. the obvious way now to make this solu-
tion also t the einstein equations of (8), is to modify these equations by
introducing a cosmological constant in te theory.
so we can use curved branes to obtain solutions of theories with cosmological
constants. the idea consists of taking a p-brane solution of a theory with
zero cosmological constant, impose on the world volume of the brane a metric
with (non-zero) constant curvature and see whether the new ansatz satises
the equations of motion of the theory with non-zero cosmological constant. in
other words, the question is whether we can relate the cosmological constant
of the world volume metric to the cosmological constant of the full theory.
the most general theory in d dimensions of gravity coupled to a dilaton and
a (p + 1)-form gauge eld in the presence of a cosmological constant is the
so-called cosmological (a, b)-model:

ld = p|g|ne2 h r  4( )2i + ()p+1

2(p+2)! ea  f 2

(p+2) + eb o .

(15)

the parameters a, b are constants parametrising the dilaton potential that
couples to the gauge elds and the cosmological constant. note that the

6

above lagrangian will only be supersymmetric for specic values of a and
b. for example, for d = 10, a = b = 0, we recover romans massive
supergravity theory [14], and for d < 10, a = b = 2 massive heterotic
supergravity [15, 16].
the equations of motion for this model are given by:

2 e(b+2) g  2    1

(p+1)! e(a+2)  t( f ) = 0,

4(p+1)! e(a+2) f 2  b

2e(b+2) = 0,

r  b+2
r + 4( )2  4 2   a
hea f 1...p+1i = 0,

where t( f ) is the energy-momentum tensor of the gauge eld

t( f ) = f1...p+1

f

1...p+1  1

2(p+2) g f 2.

a general p-brane solution in d > 2 for the case of  = 0 is of the form
[17, 18]:

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

m  h dy2
i ,

ds2 = h dx2
e2  = h  ,
f01..pi =  ih 1 ,

with the parameters , ,  and  taking the values

 = 2a
n ,

n = (p + 1)a  1

nh2(p + 1)  1

 =  2+a
n ,
2(a + 2)(d  2)i ,

2(d  2)(1 + a

2 )2 .

2 =  4
n ,

the aim is now to put a non-trivial world volume metric on these brane
solutions and see whether we can construct in this way solutions to the full
equations of motion (16). these solutions are of course not the most general
solutions to these equations. on the contrary, we are looking at a very
specic class of solutions to cosmological (a, b)-models, involving curved p-
branes. other p-brane solutions to various cosmological theories where given
in [19, 20, 16, 21].
plugging ansatz (6) into the equations (16), we obtain, upto the equations
of motion of the at p-brane:

r  b

2e(b+2)  = h  r  h  r  b

2h 

b+2

  0 ,

rmn  b+2
rij  b+2

4 e(b+2)  gmn = rmn  b+2
4 e(b+2)  gij = rij + b+2
4  h 

4  h 

b+2

 gmn  0 , (20)

 hij  0 .

these equations can be satised if

rmn =  1
 =  d2

d2  gmn ,
2  ,

rij = 1
b =  2d

d2 h +
d2 ,

2

d2 hij ,

(21)

note that the parameter b only depends on the dimension of the overall space:
for every dimension there is a well-dened cosmological dilaton potential for
which curved cosmological p-branes are allowed. the condition for gmn is the
expression for the ricci tensor of a constant curvature space, for example a

(p + 1)-dimensional (anti)-de sitter space, with cosmological constant
d2
(depending on the sign of ). the condition for the metric hij, together with
the harmonicity condition (7), is much more involved and it is not clear what
the solution is to these equations.
combining the conditions (19) for the at p-brane solution with the above
conditions (21), we nd that we have cosmological solutions for curved p-
branes with

p = d  3 .
let us now look at some explicite examples:

(22)

 romans theory: it is easy to see that there are no solutions of the
above class in ten-dimensional massive type iia supergravity, since
the condition (21) on b is not compatible with the coupling of the
cosmological constant in romans theory (b = 0). note that the curved
d8-brane solutions of [6] is not found in this setup. this is because the
curved d8-brane falls outside our ansatz: the at d8-brane is not a
solution of the type given in (18)-(19).

 massive heterotic supergravity: from eqn. (21) it follows that b
can not take the value 2 in this setup. therefore there are no curved
cosmological p-branes in massive heterotic supergravity.

 p-branes in d = 10: from eqn. (22), we see that the type iib d7-
brane coupled to rr 9-form (a = 0) can be embedded in a cosmolo-
gical theory, with dilaton coupling for the cosmological term b = 5/2,

8

the only coupling allowed in ten dimensions in this setup. of course,
this cosmological theory is no longer a supergravity theory.
if we
choose for the constant curvature surface on the world volume an eight-
dimensional ads space in horospheric coordinates, the curved cosmo-
logical d7-brane is of the form

(dt2  dx2

1  ...  dx2

7)i  h 1/2hijdyidyi ,

ds2 = h 1/2h 56

x2
7

e2  = h 2 ,
f01..7i = ih 1 ,

(23)

where the metric hij has to satisfy rij = 

8 h hij.

 p-branes in d = 6: in six dimensions, we can embedd the curved

d3-brane in a cosmological theory with dilaton coupling b = 3:
3)i  h hijdyidyi ,

1  ...  dx2

(dt2  dx2

(24)

ds2 = h 1h 12
x2
3
e2  = h 2 ,
f01..7i = 2 ih 1 .

 p-branes in d = 4: in four dimensions, strings can be embedded in a

theory with dilaton coupling b = 4.

  =  2

d2: for this value condition (21) on rij would become very
simple. however, as can be seen from eqns. (19), the constraint  = 
leads to inconsistencies.

5. conclusions

we showed that putting a ricci-at metric in the world volume of a p-brane
in supergravity leads to bps threshold intersections of the considered p-brane
with a gravitational wave or a kaluza-klein monopole. going beyond the
ricci-atness condition we found a new class of curved p-branes solutions in
theories with a particular coupling of the cosmological constant.
