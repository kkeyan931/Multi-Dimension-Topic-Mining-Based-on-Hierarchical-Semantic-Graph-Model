1 introduction

open string models have largely extended our view on consistent string theory vacua.
the foremost promising class of heterotic calabi-yau compactications has become only
a small subset of string vacua featuring n = 1 space time supersymmetry in four
dimensions and allowing chiral spectra in phenomenological interesting gauge groups.
non-perturbative heterotic vacua containing solitonic ve-branes in the background are
better described by their dual type i models, as the heterotic ve-brane is mapped to
the d5-brane in type i. generally, type i models contain d-branes in the background
supporting the gauge sector of the low energy theory, whereas gravity propagates in the
ten-dimensional bulk. therefore, such models became quite attractive in recent attempts
to establish a unication scenario with the string scale as low as 1tev [1].

type i models can be described as orientifolds of the type iib superstring by the
world-sheet parity transformation . compactication of type i string theory on various
toroidal orbifolds in six and four space dimensions have been studied in a couple of papers
[2]-[16]. in particular, for four dimensional compactications it was found that it is not
always possible to satisfy all tadpole cancellation conditions, showing a perturbative
inconsistency of some of the models [16].

in [17] we presented a new kind of six-dimensional orientifolds, for which the world-
sheet parity transformation is combined with a complex conjugation r of the internal
coordinates. in order to cancel the tadpoles appearing in the klein bottle amplitude it
was necessary to introduce d7-branes intersecting at non-trivial angles into the back-
ground. thus, for the z3, z4 and z6 toroidal orbifolds we found consistent r orien-
tifolds in six dimensions leading indeed to anomaly free massless spectra. generally, the

2

rank of the gauge groups turned out to be reduced by powers of two as compared to the
non-compact theory and extra multiplicities appeared in what we called twisted open
string sectors. note, that similar models were also discussed in [18], however the precise
relation between our models and the models in [18] is not clear.

in [19] t-duality was used to gain a better understanding of the rank reduction for r
orientifolds. in contrast to standard  orientifolds, it turned out that for r orientifolds
the background antisymmetric two-form eld is a continuous modulus, whereas the o-
diagonal part of the internal metric is frozen to discrete values. turning on these discrete
parameters leads to the reduction of the rank of the gauge group by powers of two. in
this paper we will present a geometric understanding of the extra multiplicities in twisted
open string sectors, which we introduced by hand in [17]. from the loop channel point
of view these factors are simply intersection numbers of the d-branes in question.

in the following we will study supersymmetric r orientifolds of type iia in four
space-time dimensions. we focus our attention on toroidal orbifolds preserving n = 1
supersymmetry and study the z3, z4, z6 and z
6 models in detail. analogous to the
six-dimensional case, the klein bottle tadpoles have to be cancelled by introducing d6-
branes at non-trivial angles into the background. depending on the dening lattices for
the three t 2 tori, we nd that there exists more than one consistent choice for each
zn orbifold. in particular, in contrast to ordinary orientifolds, we nd solutions to the
tadpole conditions for each zn orbifold. moreover, for the rank of the resulting gauge
groups we always obtain exactly the reduction expected from the general arguments
in [19]. at rst sight surprisingly, we only get non-chiral massless spectra, where in
the two cases, z4 and z6, accidentally the massless open string spectra t into n = 2
supermultiplets.
this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we describe the general features of r
orientifolds in four dimensions. in section 3 we discuss the z4 example in some detail,
as it already exhibits all the technical steps one has to go through when computing
such models. the sections 4 and 5 summarize the results of our computation for the
z3 and the two z6 examples, respectively.
in an appendix we have listed the klein
bottle, annulus and mobius strip amplitudes for all models discussed in this paper. in
the conclusions we nish with a brief discussion of non-supersymmetric generalizations
of the r orientifolds.

2 r orientifolds

we consider orientifolds which are obtained by combining the ordinary world sheet parity
transformation  with a conjugation r of the three complex coordinates of the six-
dimensional torus t 6. since r can also be considered as a reection of three of the
six compact coordinates, r is rather a symmetry of the type iia than of the type
iib superstring. this operation is accompanied by one of the well known cyclic orbifold
groups preserving n = 1 supersymmetry in four space-time dimensions. thus, the entire
orientifold group is given by zn  rzn . note, that these models are not related by t-
duality to standard orientifolds zn zn . instead they are dual to standard asymmetric
orientifolds zn  zn which we think deserve to be studied in their own right. to begin
with we give a more explicit denition of all the elements required.

3

2.1 proper denition

the worldsheet parity transformation  is combined with a particular reection r, which
in terms of the complex coordinates

xi  x102i + ix112i,

i = 1, 2, 3,

of a six-dimensional torus can be written as the conjugation

r : xi 7 xi.

(1)

(2)

in this basis the generator  of the orbifold group zn = {1, , ..., n 1} acts diagonally
(3)

 : xi 7 exp (2ivi) xi

and with opposite phases on the conjugate variables. in the same way the complexied
fermionic coordinates diagonalize . both for the rr and the twisted nsns sector the
operation of r and  on degenerate groundstates is given by
7 |s0,s1,s2,s3i,
7 exp (2i~v  ~s)|s0, s1, s2, s3i.

r : |s0, s1, s2, s3i
 : |s0, s1, s2, s3i

(4)

if the groundstate is not a spinor of the entire light-cone gauge so(8) little group, but
only of a so(2k) subgroup, one can formally set the respective si in (4) to zero to
obtain the correct transformation. there is a subtlety concerning the gso projection
in the twisted sectors. taking into account that the r projection is related to the 
projection by t-duality in the three directions in which r acts non-trivially, one is led
to the following left moving and right moving world sheet fermion number operators

(1)fl |s0, s1, s2, s3i = exp (2i(s0  s1  s2  s3))|s0, s1, s2, s3i,
(1)fr |s0, s1, s2, s3i = exp (2i(s0 + s1 + s2 + s3))|s0, s1, s2, s3i.

(5)

with this choice of world-sheet fermion number operators the gso projection is on states
satisfying (1)fl = (1)fr = 1. in the untwisted sector of the orientifolds this is ap-
parently equivalent to the usual type iia gso projection and in the twisted sectors it
guarantees that r is really a symmetry of the type iia orbifold theory. in the various
open string sectors the gso projection is always determined by supersymmetry.

orbifolds that allow n = 1 supersymmetry in four dimensions have been classied
in [21, 22] and we display their action on the complex basis in terms of the vi in table 1.

12 : v = (1, 5,6)/12

in this paper we will restrict ourselves to explicit computations for the orbifolds z3,
z4, z6 and z
6. it has been established for ordinary four dimensional type i vacua that
there exists no solution to the tadpole cancellation conditions for the cases z4, z8, z
8
and z12 [14] 4. in contrast to that, we obtain perturbatively consistent r orientifolds
for any zn model studied in this paper.

for the compact t 6 one needs to use a lattice that allows a crystallographic action
of the above cyclic groups. up to overall scales in each t 2 factor, for the z3 and z6
case we choose the root lattice of su (3)3 and for the z4 case the root lattice of su (2)6.
except for the z3 example these are not of the type explored in [23], which allow to take
the coxeter element of the lie algebra as the generator of the orbifold group. as the
particular choice of the lattice enters at various important points into the calculation of
the tadpole cancellation conditions and the spectrum, dierent lattices may lead to even
more inequivalent models. with our choice we obtain twelve inequivalent models from
the four orbifolds by the freedom of choice in the relative orientations of the lattices with
respect to the reection r.

in the following we describe in some detail the general features that arise in computing
the three contributions to the massless tadpoles arising in the klein bottle, annulus and
mobius strip amplitudes. the truly technical details of the explicit expressions can be
found in the appendix. part of the following discussion already appeared in [17], but
in a couple of important questions substantial progress could be achieved. for instance,
we clarify the appearance of extra weight factors for twisted open string sectors in the
annulus and mobius strip amplitudes. in [17] these factors were detected by employing
the equivalence between the tree channel and the loop channel description of the annulus.
now, we can give a striking geometric interpretation of these factors as intersection
numbers of the d-branes supporting the twisted open string sector.

2.2 closed strings

in the closed string sector the states with excitations of left-moving oscillators combine
with their complex conjugate images on the right-moving side into r invariant states

n+kvi(cid:1) ,
(r)(cid:0)n+kvi
(r) (nkvi nkvi) (r)1 = (nkvi nkvi)

n+kvi(cid:1) (r)1 = (cid:0)n+kvi

(6)

with  representing any kind of bosonic or fermionic ladder operator of the k-twisted
sector and n  z or n  z + 1/2. as opposed to standard orientifolds the r invariant
states in (6) are also invariant under the zn action

 (nkvi nkvi) 1 = (nkvi nkvi) .

n+kvi(cid:1) 1 = (cid:0)n+kvi

(cid:0)n+kvi

n+kvi(cid:1) ,

(7)

the important point to notice is that r does not exchange a k twisted sector with a
n k twisted sector, so that all twisted sectors lead to a non-vanishing contribution to

4see also [20] for a recent discussion of similar models leading to supersymmetry breaking on the

d-branes.

with c  v4/(cid:0)82(cid:1)2 and the momentum integration in the non-compact space-time

already performed. remember, that for conventional orientifolds only the untwisted
and, if present, the z2 twisted sectors contribute to this amplitude. here, the relation

(8)

rk = n kr

(9)

implies that in the tree channel only untwisted closed string states propagate between
the two cross-caps on both sides of the tube. thus, world sheet consistency requires that
transforming the loop channel amplitude (8) into tree channel must lead to an amplitude
in which only zn invariant states from the untwisted sector contribute. in doing the
computation one realizes that this world-sheet consistency condition is not always au-
tomatically satised. therefore, the completion of the zn projector in the tree channel
will serve as the guiding principle in constructing consistent models.

since the action of  in the basis of r invariant states is always trivial on the
oscillator part, in each zn twisted sector the complete klein bottle amplitude factorizes
into a trace over the oscillators times a trace over the lattice. to compute the lattice part,
one needs to determine the winding (w) and the kaluza-klein (kk) modes which are
invariant under the operator rk appearing in the trace. to begin with, let us consider
a single two-dimensional torus, on which  acts as a rotation by an angle  = 2/n .
in fact the entire lattice partition function of the six-dimensional torus factorizes into a
product of three two-dimensional tori with an action of  as a 2vi/n rotation on each
individual factor. let us dene the lattice type a to be the orientation of the zn lattice
such that the reection r acts orthogonally to one of the two basis vectors that span
the lattice. in this case the relation

(cid:16)rk(cid:17) 2 = 1(cid:16)rk(cid:17) 

implies that the partition function of the lattice with rk insertion does only depend on
k being even or odd. rotating the lattice by an angle of /n for even and /(2n ) for odd
n leads to the lattice type b and constitutes the only non-trivial rotation maintaining
a crystallographic action of r. due to the relation

(10)

(11)

1/2(cid:16)rk(cid:17) 1/2 =(cid:16)rk(cid:17) 

the two cases, even and odd, get exchanged. note, that in the special case of the z3
orbifold the rotation 1/2 is a symmetry of the lattice implying that the klein bottle
contributions are entirely independent of k.

it appears to be the correct choice for world-sheet consistency, that whenever the
orbifold model has two complex directions with n vi odd and only one with n vi even,
r acts dierently on the two odd directions and arbitrarily on the even direction. said
dierently, we choose the lattices ab or ba for the two odd directions and in the even

6

direction we are free to choose either a or b. in this way one produces a partition func-
tion which in the untwisted sector loop channel yields identical contributions for all k
insertions in the trace. accidentally, this remains true for the twisted sectors with the
exception of the z
6 case, the two choices ab and ba for the two
odd tori lead to dierent models. summarizing, for the z3 orbifold we have the four
inequivalent choices {aaa, aab, abb, bbb}, for the z4 and the z6 the two choices
{aba, abb} and nally for the z

6 the four choices {aab, abb, baa, bba}.

6 orientifold. in the z

we have also inspected some of the cases without any relative angle between the
lattices of the two-dimensional tori, but found that these never lead to the complete zn
projector in the tree channel. thus, the world-sheet consistency condition is violated
and in the spirit of [16] it is tempting to speculate that this might hint to the existence
of non-perturbative states which remove this discrepancy. to prove these speculation
it is of primary importance to nd a heterotic or f-theory dual description of the r
orientifolds.

in order to compute the loop channel klein bottle amplitude in the l twisted sector,
we have to know which of the l xed points are invariant under the action of rk.
these multiplicities arise from the center of mass coordinate of the string. it is required
to be invariant under the twisting element as well as under the insertion in the trace.
with the exception of the z
6 orientifold the number of invariant xed points does not
6 example the 2
depend on k, though dierent individual points are invariant. in the z
and 4 twisted sectors split into a sum of two terms containing the r2k and r2k+1
insertions in the trace, respectively. note, that the xed point multiplicities non-trivially
conspire with the relative factors arising from the modular transformation of the lattice
contributions in order to complete the tree channel projector.

regarding these subtleties the computation of the various amplitudes is a straight-
forward though still tedious task. all the results for the dierent traces involved can
be found in the appendix and the z4 example will be discussed in greater detail in the
following chapter.

finally, we need to compute the massless spectra. the rst step is to add up the

ground state energies in the twisted sectors using the general formula

e0 =

3

xi=0(cid:18) 1
24 

1
8

(2kvi  1)2(cid:19),

(12)

which is presented for a complex boson of the k-twisted sector. for the fermions the
sign changes to e0 and in the nsns sector one needs to replace vi by vi + 1/2. in
the untwisted sector  invariant left- and right-moving massless states have to be sym-
metrized and antisymmetrized under r in the nsns and the rr sector respectively.
this always contributes the graviton and dilaton from the nsns sector and some model
dependent number of additional neutral chiral multiplets. for the twisted sectors one
carefully needs to inspect the transformation properties of the xed points. for instance
those which are invariant under r and  need to be properly symmetrized and anti-
symmetrized as in the untwisted sector. it also happens that the xed points are only

7

invariant under a combination of r and  or even under neither of the two transfor-
mations. in the latter case no symmetrization at all has to take place. following this
procedure, the total number of chiral multiplets is exactly the sum of the hodge numbers
of the blown up toroidal orbifold

number of neutral chiral multiplets = h1,1 + h2,1.

(13)

in particular, for inequivalent orientifold models with identical orbifold groups we nd
the same net number of multiplets in the closed string spectrum, while the individual
states are dierent. in table 2 we display the closed string spectra for the orientifolds
discussed in this paper.

in the untwisted sector there are always the graviton and the dilaton multiplet in addition

2.3 open strings

analogously to the six-dimensional models studied in [17], in order to cancel the tad-
poles from the klein bottle we have to introduce d6-branes intersecting each other at
non-trivial angles. they always stretch in one direction on each two-dimensional torus
and need to intersect in a  and r invariant fashion. matching the modings of the
elds in the closed string twisted sectors, open strings stretching between d-branes at
relative angle vi carry elds with modings shifted by vi. thus, we are led to consider
arrays of n kinds of d-branes at this relative angle. on each torus t 2 one of them is
located in the xed plane of the reection r and the remaining ones are obtained by
successively applying the rotation 1/2. note that some of them will coincide in some
complex directions eventually.

in the open string sector one has to compute the annulus

these amplitudes only receive a non-vanishing contribution from open strings in the
(6i, 6i+n) sector, if the action of the operator in the trace leaves the two d6-branes and
the orientation of the open string invariant. if the moding of the elds in the (6i, 6i+n)
open string sector is similar to the moding of the elds in the k twisted closed string
sector, we also use the term k twisted for the open string sector. for even n the oper-
ator n/2 leaves all d6i-branes invariant and has a non-trivial action on the chan-paton
factors as usually described by a matrix (i)
n/2. correspondingly, the annulus amplitude
gives rise to an additional z2 twisted sector tadpole.

some care has to be taken when computing the contributions of momenta and wind-
ing states, which are present for (6i, 6i+n) strings whenever the two branes coincide in
some complex direction and the operator in the trace acts trivially there. one then needs
to consider the orientation of the brane with respect to the lattice and determine the
allowed winding and momentum states. in the mobius strip amplitude these kk and w
modes also have to be invariant under r. generally this leads to a doubling of winding
states as compared to the annulus, with the exception of the a type su (2)2 lattice. the
present choice of lattices and branes guarantees that the contributions are independent of
the operator in the trace for a given sector, except again for the (6i, 6i+2) strings in the z
6.

a very important point in the computation are the extra multiplicities of some twisted
open string sectors introduced in [17] by hand in order to satisfy the world-sheet consis-
tency condition. these extra multiplicities were determined by the complete projector
in the tree channel and nicely led to tadpole cancellation and anomaly free massless
spectra. unfortunately, in [17] we could not present an understanding of these factors
from the loop channel point of view, which we would like to do now. the source for the
extra multiplicities is again the center of mass coordinate of the open string, which is
required to be an intersection point of the two d-branes. the number of such intersection
points of the respective d-branes in question perfectly reproduces these extra factors and
thus gives a striking geometrical interpretation. for computing the annulus and mobius
strip amplitude, these intersection points need to be invariant under the operator in the
trace. it turns out that the number of invariant intersection points of (6i, 6i+n) branes
is independent of i with the exception of n = 2 in the z
6 orientifold. in [19] these extra
multiplicities have been related via t-duality to extra factors for twisted sectors in or-
dinary  orientifolds with background b eld. so far we have presented all the novel
ingredients needed to compute the two open string amplitudes and the details are left to
the appendix and to the discussion of the z4 example.

let us now discuss the main steps for computing the massless open string spectrum.
one has to be very careful again with the contributions of the dierent intersection
points. first of all we notice, that one always gets a tadpole cancellation condition of
the form

xing the number m of d6-branes of each type. for even zn there is an additional z2
twisted tadpole condition, which requires

(m  2)2 = 0

(16)

tr(cid:16)(i)

n/2(cid:17) = 0

9

(17)

exactly resembling the computation for the standard six-dimensional z2 orientifold dis-
cussed by gimon and polchinski (gp) in [4]. we can therefore copy their solution for the
chan-paton degrees of freedom, which implies an so(m) gauge group on each stack of
branes, broken to its u (m/2) subgroup, if n is even. we simplify the analysis by looking
at those open strings only, which begin on one of the branes located in the xed plane of
r, as all other states are related to these by some action of the orientifold group. again,
for the z
6 model the situation is slightly dierent and one has to consider the branes of
odd and even i separately.

for the massless states in the untwisted ns sector the action of the ordinary  on
d9-branes is identical to the action of r on d6-branes, as the additional signs which 
contributes to the dirichlet directions just cancel the reection. for even n we therefore
only need to distinguish further, whether n/2 acts by a reection or trivially on a
given state, i.e.
if n vi/2 is integer or not. a single physical state with a reection
contributes two states of a multiplet in the antisymmetric representation of the gauge
group, while a state with trivial action contributes a single state of a multiplet in the
adjoint representation. by inspecting table 1 one can easily realize, that generically there
is one complex direction, which n/2 acts trivially on, while it reects the other two. by
this reasoning we nd, that the untwisted sector always contributes a vector and a chiral
multiplet in the adjoint representation of the gauge group from the trivial directions and
four chiral multiplets in the antisymmetric representation from the reected directions.
for odd n , in addition to the vector multiplet there simply appear 3 chiral multiplets
in the antisymmetric representation.

similar to the closed string case, for the twisted sectors things become more involved.
first one needs to do the same distinction concerning the chan-paton labels as for the
untwisted sector above. moreover, one has to distinguish the contributions of the var-
ious intersection points, which may be invariant under  and r or not. finally, one
must keep track of various phase factors, that appear via modular transformation and
provide additional relative signs. this needs to be taken into account, when doing any
symmetrization or antisymmetrization of chan-paton labels. since the computation of
the open string spectrum of the four-dimensional r orientifolds is similar to a z2 stan-
dard orientifold, we only nd non-chiral spectra in mostly rather small gauge groups.
remember, that standard four-dimensional zn orientifolds for n > 2 generically have
chiral spectra.

after having explained all the principles, we now come to the detailed discussion of
one example. we have chosen the z4 as it already exhibits all the generic features we
have went through while not being as complicated in technical terms as the z
6.

3 the z4 orientifold

the z4 action is given by v = (1, 1,2)/4 and up to scales for the t 6 we choose the root
lattice of su (2)6. in figure 1 we depicted the two possible choices of relative orientations
of the su (2)2 lattice with respect to the xed line of r, which is identical to one of the
coordinate axes for each t 2.

for the respective orientations of the lattice. the states invariant under r2k+1 are
obtained by exchanging a and b in (18) for the rst two su (2)2 tori, whereas they are
identical to (18) for the third t 2. by world-sheet consistency we are forced to choose
the lattices in the rst two t 2 tori as ab and in the third t 2 we are free to choose it
either a or b. thus, we get the two inequivalent models aba and abb. we display all
results rst for the aba model and state relative factors for the abb case separately.
the number of xed points in  and 3 twisted sectors is 16 in either case, but for abb
only 8 are invariant under rk. in the 2 twisted sector one has also 16 xed points,
of which one half is invariant under rk both for aba and abb. note, that the
expected relative prefactors for the terms in the complete projector in the tree channel
amplitude are

the relative factors are in perfect match with the expected ones in (19). this is also true
for the abb lattice, as the only dierence is an overall factor of 1/2, originating both
from the lattice partition functions and from the reduction of the number of invariant
xed points. this is quite a remarkable coincidence, indeed.

to cancel the tadpole of the klein bottle, we introduce d6i-branes into the back-
ground as shown in figure 2, where i = 1, . . . , 4 mod 4. the relative angles are vi and
the 61-branes are lying entirely inside the xed plane of r.

figure 2: branes on the z4 torus

as the orientifold group does not mix even and odd numbered branes, they will carry
distinct factors of the gauge group and the only elds that transform non-trivially under
both factors arise in the (6i, 6i+1) and (6i, 6i+3) open string sectors.

as we have already anticipated in section 2, putting for instance the d6-branes in the
third t 2 at an angle  = /4 relative to the x4 axes we would get both dierent kk and
w contributions and dierent intersection numbers. the transformation to tree channel
shows that for this choice of the d6-branes there is no chance to cancel tadpoles. thus,
tadpole cancellation uniquely xes the location of the d6-branes.

if we change the lattice to abb, while keeping the branes xed, we get an extra overall
factor of 2 due to dierent kk and w sums as well as a dierent intersection number
for (6i, 6i+1) strings. in both cases the projector in the tree channel is complete.

the nal contribution comes from the mobius strip amplitude, where the invariant

windings and momenta are independent of the particular choice of the lattice:

there are no extra factors whatsoever in the mobius strip amplitude when switching to
the abb lattice. summarizing, we get the following untwisted and z2 twisted tadpole
cancellation conditions for the aba model

1

8(cid:0)m2  32m + 256(cid:1) =

1

3 + 13 = 0,
4 + 24 = 0.

1 + 2
2
2 + 2

(m  16)2 = 0,

(26)

13

deriving the z2 twisted tadpole cancellation conditions one realizes that the 61,3 and 62,4
branes are charged under dierent twisted rr 5-forms. this can be seen by taking all
the volume factors appearing in the amplitude into account individually. more precisely,
the twisted sector tadpole condition receives contributions from the sixteen individual
z2 xed points. analyzing the intersection of the d6-branes with the 16 xed points
allows us to write each twisted sector tadpole condition as a sum of 6 perfect squares

2 h(1 + 3)2 + 2
2 h(2 + 4)2 + 2

1 + 2

2 + 2

3i = 0,
4i = 0.

(27)

apparently, in order to satisfy these 12 conditions we have to choose i = 0 for all
i  {1, 2, 3, 4}.

for the abb conguration the untwisted tadpole condition becomes

1

4(cid:0)m2  16m + 64(cid:1) =

1
4

(m  8)2 = 0

(28)

with unchanged conditions for the twisted sector tadpoles. thus, the z4 orientifold gives
rise to two dierent models, one with gauge group of rank 16 and the other one with
gauge group of rank 8.

the massless closed string spectrum of the aba model receives six chiral multiplets
from the untwisted sector besides the graviton and dilaton multiplets. moreover, in the
1,3 twisted sectors the 16 xed points are all invariant under r and give rise to 16 chiral
multiplets. finally, the 16 xed points of 2 need to be distinguished with respect to
their mapping under ,r and even r providing another 16 chiral multiplets.
open strings in the (6i, 6i) sector carry eight massless states, which provide a vector
multiplet in the gauge group u (8) u (8), a chiral multiplet in the adjoint representation
((64, 1)  (1, 64)) and two chiral multiplets in the(cid:0)(28, 1)  (28, 1)  (1, 28)  (1, 28)(cid:1)
representation. in the (6i, 6i+2) sector one has to take into account the extra minus signs
in the loop channel mobius strip amplitude (24), implying that compared to the (6i, 6i)
sector both the r and the 2 projection change sign. considering also the multiplicity
due to the twofold degeneracy of the ground state in this sector and an extra factor of
two from the intersections between 6i and 6i+2 branes one gets two chiral multiplets in
the ((64, 1)  (1, 64)) representation. finally the (6i, 6i+1) strings only carry a single
massless state to be counted with two orientations giving rise to one chiral multiplet in
the(cid:0)(8, 8)  (8, 8)(cid:1) representation. inspecting the massless open string spectrum reveals
that it is not only non-chiral but surprisingly ts into n = 2 multiplets. however, the d-
branes in the (6i, 6i+1) sector only preserve n = 1 supersymmetry, so that the appearance
of n = 2 multiplets is purely accidental. the complete n = 1 supersymmetric massless
open string spectrum is shown in table 3, where we have also summarized the results
for the abb model.

4 results for the z3 orientifold

in this section we make some remarks on the specialities of the other models we have ex-
plicitly computed. we show how the lattices and brane congurations look like, give the
tadpole cancellation conditions and their solutions in terms of the gauge groups. finally
we display the massless open and closed string spectra. the details of the computation
are collected in the appendix.

the z3 orientifold is very similar to the six-dimensional z3 model that has been
discussed in some detail in [17]. as was pointed out in [19] one is free to choose any of
the four possible lattices {aaa, aab, abb, bbb}. in all four cases the d6-branes
are located in the same way on all three 2-tori as shown in figure 3.

plitudes and on the other hand causes the number of intersections to be 3i, too. these
extra factors aect the multiplicities for the dierent massless open string modes. in all

note, that in the (6i, 6i+1) sector, the phases in the denition and modular properties of
the -functions lead to the symmetric representation of the gauge group.

5 results for the z6 and z6 orientifolds

for each of the two z6 orbifold groups we obtain two inequivalent models on the massless
level. as mentioned in section 2, we are forced to choose lattices ab or ba in the two
directions with n vi odd and can arbitrarily choose the lattice for the third t 2 to be
either a or b. the two lattices of a and b type are shown in figure 4.

the z2 twisted tadpole condition is similar to the one in (27) and can be satised by
choosing traceless (i)
3 matrices, leading to a u (2) u (2) gauge group. taking all twisted
sectors and intersection points into account we derive the n = 1 supersymmetric open
string massless spectrum shown in table 5. to distinguish su (2) singlets which are
charged or neutral under the u (1) we use the notation 1 and 10. the 2 and 2 are
similarly distinguished by their abelian u (1) charges.

special care needs to be taken in the 2-twisted sector of the z
6 model, as the partition
function of the kk and w states as well as the number of xed points and intersections
does depend on the factor of the gauge group. eventually, everything comes out just
right and leads to the complete projector in the tree channel. as a consequence the two
choices ab and ba in the directions of odd n vi lead to slightly dierent models. as can
be seen by direct computation, on the massless level this dierence is only an exchange
of the two gauge factors.

again the untwisted tadpole cancellation condition is unaected by the change and

reads explicitly:

we used the rst gauge factor for the theory on the odd d6i-branes. in contrast to the
other cases discussed so far, the massless spectrum of the z
6 orientifold is not invariant
under exchange of the two u (2) gauge factors.

6 conclusions

in this paper we have studied r orientifolds of type iia in four dimensions. we
found a couple of models for which the tadpole cancellation conditions could be satised,
leading to non-chiral massless spectra on the d6-branes. it would be interesting to study
the other n = 1 supersymmetric orbifolds from table 1, as well. however, for these
cases the contribution of the lattices is more involved, as they cannot be factorized as
t 6 = t 2  t 2  t 2. even knowing the basis vectors of t 6 tori with z7, z8 and z12
symmetry is not enough, one also has to orientate the lattice in such a way that also the
reection r acts crystallograhically, which may give rise to a variety of distinct models.
as we pointed out in [17] these r orientifolds might also be interesting for non-
supersymmetric generalizations. in particular, the (1)fl orientifolds of type 0b are
known to be sometimes free of tachyons leading to classically stable non-supersymmetric
string vacua [24]. however, for standard zn orientifolds with n  3 some tachyons ap-
pearing in the twisted sectors survive the  projection. the reason is, that  exchanges
the k twisted sector with the k twisted sector, so that one linear combination of both
tachyons survives. since in the r case, the twisted sectors are left invariant one may
hope that at least the closed string sector of type 0a zn orientifolds is free of tachyons.
sometimes this is indeed the case. however, it is easy to see that the tachyons now return
in the open string sectors, namely in the twisted open string sectors. thus, in contrast
to our earlier expectation type 0a r(1)fl orientifolds also generically contain open
string tachyons and do not behave better than standard type 0b (1)fl orientifolds.

a one-loop partition functions

the general strategy to compute the several one loop contributions to the massless
tadpoles is as usual: we compute the loop diagrams of the klein bottle, the annulus
and the mobius strip and convert the results via a modular s transformation sending
t 7 1/t into the tree channel, expand the integrand for large distances and extract the
coecients of the divergent terms. this gives us a condition for the number of branes and
for the action of non-trivially represented chan-paton matrices, the only one being (i)
n/2
for the zn orbifolds with even n . in general we denote the unitary action on chan-paton
labels by (i)

rk for k and rk acting on the d6i-branes respectively.

k and (i)

a.1 klein bottle

the klein bottle amplitude in the loop channel has the general form

insertion of k inside

k(n,k)  tr(n)

osc(cid:16)rk (cid:0)1 + (1)f(cid:1) e2t(l0+ l0)(cid:17)

and l(n,k)

l(n,k)

kk+w(cid:16)rk e2t(l0+ l0)(cid:17) .

k

here (n,k)
is the number of xed points of n, which are invariant under the operator
rk in the trace. except for the z
6 orbifold these numbers, as well as the entire traces
are equal for any insertion of k and even in that case only the lattice contributions
dier, so we can factorize the partition function as in (32). in all other cases we omit
k . as a shorthand for the contributions of

k , k(n) and (n)

(32)

(33)

the bosonic zero modes we use

the superscript k, writing l(n)

for all amplitude we used the convention

x(nvi,kvi) /z2

nvi = 0.

the oscillator sums lead to the generic expression

(38)

l(n,k)

k

has contributions whenever nvi  z. in contrast to the oscillator part we cannot
give any generic formula for the lattice sums, since one has to take into account which
momentum and winding states are invariant under the respective operator in the trace.
this does not only depend on the orbifold group action, as given by the vi, but also
on the orientation of the lattice with respect to the reection r. for the tree channel
amplitudes we also dene appropriate abbreviations:

k(n)

the argument of k(n)

complete projector is therefore

(v1,v2,v3) being q = exp (4l). the expected prefactor to yield the

(2 sin(nvi)).

ynvi /z

(40)

the volume factors from the modular transformation formally cancel out, the divergence
being related to a tadpole of a 7-form eld.

a.2 annulus

the open string diagrams can also be factorized into oscillator and momentum and
winding parts. for the annulus the loop channel reads

a =

(cid:17)1(cid:19) a(n,k) l(n,k,i)


and analogously to the above we dene

(41)

(42)

a(n,k)  tr(i,i+n)

osc

(cid:16)k(cid:0)1 + (1)f(cid:1) e2tl0(cid:17) ,

where the trace is to be performed over the oscillator excitations of the open strings
stretching between the i and i + n branes, with only k  {0, n/2} contributions non-
0 (cid:17)2
vanishing. concerning the chan-paton matrices, we choose tr(cid:16)(i)
= m2, leaving only
n/2(cid:17) and the number of branes, m, to be determined by the tadpole cancellation
tr(cid:16)(i)

conditions. the bosonic zero modes contribute

l(n,k,)

a

 (n,k,)

a

tr(i,i+n)

kk+w(cid:16)k e2tl0(cid:17) .

21

(43)

(n,k,)
is the number of intersections of the two types of branes on the torus, which
a
are invariant under k. the trace (43) is only dierent from 1 if the i and i + n branes
coincide in some (real) direction on the torus t 6 and k acts trivially in the complex
plane of this direction. in the z
6 orbifold there is another distinction between odd and
even i, which we have reserved the extra superscript  for. for the oscillator part we
get the generic formula

eihnvii

 y(nvi,kvi)z2


h 0

h 0

a(n,k)
(v1,v2,v3)  (1  1)

(44)
with argument q = exp (2t). the second product is empty, except if both nvi and
kvi are integers, which is also the only case, in which there are contributions to l(n,k,)
.
we have introduced factors of 2 for cancelling inappropriate factors occurring in the
theta functions by dening  = 1 if nvi  z and kvi  z + 1/2 and  = 0 otherwise.
one could have omitted these extra factors by using the notations of [14], for instance,
but this would then imply a denition of the case  = 1 via some limit of the otherwise
undened formula, which we preferred to avoid. again there is no generic expression for
the lattice sums and one needs to consider not only the type of brane as given by i, n but
also their orientation on the torus, in order to determine the normalization of momenta
can then be written in the form of (35), of course. for the

a

and winding states. l(n,k,)

tree channel oscillators we use

a

a(n,k)
(v1,v2,v3)  (1  1)

h 1/2
0 i

y(nvi,kvi) /z2

 y(nvi,kvi)z2


h 1/2

 (45)

with argument q = exp (4l). in the tree channel the annulus only contributes to the
untwisted and n/2 twisted sector, corresponding to the 7-form and a twisted 5-form
tadpole.

a.3 mobius strip

finally we need to go through the mobius strip amplitude. the loop channel expression
is

m = 

v4

(82)2 z 

0

dt

t3

rk(cid:17)1(cid:16)(i)

m 
rk(cid:17)t(cid:19) m(n,k) l(n,k,i)
,

with the oscillator

m(n,k)  tr(1,1+n)

osc

and the zero mode trace

(cid:16)rk (cid:0)1 + (1)f(cid:1) e2tl0(cid:17)

l(n,k,)

m

 (n,k,)

m

tr(i,i+n)

kk+w(cid:16)rk e2tl0(cid:17) .

22

(46)

(47)

(48)

now (n,k,)
under rk. by looking at the following chain of mappings of open strings

denotes the number of intersection points of the i and i+n branes, invariant

m

(i, i + n)

k

 (i + 2k, i + n + 2k)

r (2  i  2k, 2  i  n  2k)

 (2  i  n  2k, 2  i  2k)

(49)

one realizes that only strings that satisfy 2(k +i1)+n = 0 mod n can contribute in the
mobius strip. if n is even, the relation has two solutions k  1in/2, 1in/2+n/2
for any combination of i, n/2  z and only one for any i, n  z, if n is odd. by regarding

r1in/2 = (1i)/2(cid:16)rn/2(cid:17) (1i)/2

(50)

one nds that r1in/2 leaves the (6i, 6i+n) strings invariant just like rn/2 the
(61, 61+n) strings, which are those that start on the brane in the xed plane of r. on
these r itself acts simply like the ordinary  on strings with neumann boundary
conditions only, as the additional signs of  cancel the reection. the oscillator traces
for all other values of i are identical to the i = 1 case, but the contributions arise from
dierent n, k combinations. for the oscillator part we then get the formula

m(n,k)

(v1,v2,v3)  (1  1)

h 1/2
0 i

3

y(nvi,kvi) /z2

 y(nvi,kvi)z2


h 1/2
0 i
3 

(51)

with argument q =  exp (2t), which enforces a dierent modular transformation
property. as for the annulus, there are lattice contributions if nvi and kvi are both
integers. they dier from those of the annulus, as one needs to sum over states invariant
under r, which boils down to doubling the winding quantum numbers, except for the
z4, where they remain unchanged for the a type of lattice, while they are still doubled
for the b type. for the modular transformed mobius strip we use

m(m)

(v1,v2,v3)  (1  1)

h 1/2
0 i
3 ymvi /z

with argument q =  exp (4l).

b denitions and modular transformation formulas

in this appendix we give basic denitions and x some notation. we frequently employ
the jacobi theta function and dedekind eta function

q(n+)2/2 e2i(n+),

(cid:20) 
(cid:21) (t) = xnz

(t) = q1/24



yn=1

(1  qn),

(53)

23

setting q  e2t. the argument  is dened modulo z and in order to directly use the
product expansion

i
h 

(t) = e2i q2/21/24



yn=1(cid:16)(cid:16)1 + qn1/2+e2i(cid:17)(cid:16)1 + qn1/2e2i(cid:17)(cid:17)

(54)

one needs to choose   (1/2, 1/2].
the modular s transformation is

(cid:21)(cid:0)t1(cid:1) = t e2i(cid:20)
(cid:20) 
(cid:0)t1(cid:1) = t (t).

 (cid:21) (t) ,

h (+1)/2
/2+i (cid:0)q2(cid:1)
(+1)/2+i h /2
h (+1)/2

(55)

(56)

in order to rewrite the loop channel mobius strip amplitude in terms of the appropriate
tree level elds we use the identity



i
h +1/2
+1/2i
h +1/2

(q) = ei

for 1 <   0. for the modular transformation of lattice and momentum and winding
sums we need the poisson resummation formula

en2/t = t xnz
