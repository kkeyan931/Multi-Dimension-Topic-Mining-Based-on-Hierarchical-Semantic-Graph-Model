regime may possible description. good reasons search holographic theory. simplest idea would dene theory geometric back- ground given screen-hypersurface(s). theory contained one de- gree freedom per planck area, related kind dictionary (du- ality) space-time (bulk) physics, holographic principle would manifest. let us call type theory dual theory. idea works certain asymptotically anti-de sitter space-times. screen encoding entire bulk information timelike hypersur- face formed boundary space (sec. 3.1). according maldacenas 25 remarkable conjecture {$9905177$}, super-yang-mills theory living hypersur- face describes bulk physics completely. considering nite boundary taking limit moves spatial innity, one show theory contains one degree freedom per planck area {$9905177$}. therefore dual theory sense denition. perhaps possible nd dual theories classes space-times; certainly would important contribution understanding holography quantum gravity. general, however, dual theory approach work. theories usually think xed number degrees freedom built them; degrees freedom evolve lorentzian time. consider cosmological solutions studied sec. 3.4. area screens time-dependent. screen theory would capable creating activating degrees freedom. moreover, area decrease, seen closed universe example. screen theory would correspond destruction, de- activation, degrees freedom. eventually number would approach zero, second law thermodynamics would violated screen theory.4 (note not, course, imply violation second law bulk. rather, related creation, destruction, degrees freedom initial nal singularities universe.) suggests one general think screen theory conventional theory xed number degrees freedom. rather, one might expect theory varying number active degrees freedom. thus, properties would dierent ordinary physical theories. moreover, since screen hypersurfaces spacelike null, one expect theory live lorentzian time. 4.3 geometry entropy would like advocate radical approach. one thinking screen theory (a theory dened hypersurface space-time) all. screen theory approach cannot fundamental, presumes existence space-time background, least asymptotic structure space time. order use holographic principle full description nature, suggest turned around. loosely speaking, one constrain entropy geometry, 4we grateful andrei linde stressing point us. 26 construct geometry entropy. (strictly, number degrees freedom replace entropy here.) construction must holographic principle, form given sec. 1.1, automatically satised. thus appears two problems must overcome holographic theory found. first, one must formulate theory varying number degrees freedom. possibility may theory activate de-activate degrees freedom innite reservoir.5 extreme perhaps satisfying resolution would treat quantum degrees freedom fundamental ingredients, derived concept. hooft long advocating models sought quantum degrees freedom arise complex, eective structures (see ref. {$9905177$} references therein). would natural ndof vary models. second challenge nd prescription allows unique recon- struction space-time geometry varying number degrees free- dom (see, e.g., refs.  references therein discussion related questions). part prescription equate ndof proper area embedded (d 2)-dimensional preferred optimal screen. dicult question intrinsic geometry screen-hypersurfaces recovered. may undesirable identify discrete steps of, say, cellular automaton {$9902088$} lorentzian time. number character degrees freedom provide information matter content. therefore complete reconstruction space-time geometry inconceivable. acknowledgments indebted gerard hooft, andrei linde, lenny susskind helpful discussions, well important criticism suggestions. thank lenny susskind valuable comments draft paper.
