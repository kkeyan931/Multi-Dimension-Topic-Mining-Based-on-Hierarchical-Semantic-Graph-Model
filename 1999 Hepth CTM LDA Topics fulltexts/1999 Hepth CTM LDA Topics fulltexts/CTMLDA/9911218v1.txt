abstract

we study some aspects of dilatonic domain walls in relation to the randall-sundrum
model on noncompact internal space. we construct fully localized supergravity solu-
tions describing extreme dilatonic branes within extreme dilatonic domain walls and
the bps branes within the bps domain walls of string theories. these solutions are
valid in any region of spacetime, not just in the region close to the domain walls.

1 introduction

it was kaluza [1] who showed that the einsteins theory of four-dimensional gravity and
the maxwells theory of electromagnetism can be unied within the ve-dimensional
theory of general relativity. in his derivation of his model, kaluza avoided the question
of unobservableness of such extra fth coordinate simply by assuming that all the elds
do not depend on the extra coordinates. later, klein [2] explained the unobservableness
of and the independence of physical quantities on the extra coordinate by assuming
the extra spatial dimension to be too small to be observed. namely, if one assumes
the extra dimension to be a compact manifold, i.e. a circle in the klein case, then
all the elds can be fourier-expanded and the fourier coecients are identied as
elds in compactied lower dimensions. since mass scale of such fourier modes, called
the kaluza-klein (kk) modes, is inversely proportional to the size of compactication
manifold, if the size of the manifold becomes very small, then the extra massive kk
modes become too heavy to be observed. so, in the limit of very small compactication
manifold, one can eectively keep only zero modes of the kk spectrum, thereby leading
to the original kaluzas assumption that the physical quantities simply do not depend
on the extra coordinate.

this idea of klein has been dominantly taken within particle physics, including
the kk supergravity theories and superstring theories. however, the problem with
the kleins idea on small extra space is that it cannot explain why the extra space
has to be markedly dierent in topology and in size. one of alternative approaches
which attempt to address this problem assumes that the extra space is on the same
footing as our four-dimensional spacetime, namely the elds depend on the extra space
which is now assumed to have innite extend just like our four-dimensional spacetime
or to be not very small. however, the challenge of this approach is to explain why
the extra space has not been observed. to avoid this diculty, it was argued that
particles are trapped inside of the four-dimensional hypersurface by a potential well
[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. this idea was also proposed [5, 6, 7] in an attempt to
explain smallness of cosmological constant in our four-dimensional universe.

this old idea on noncompact extra space recently has received revived attention, af-
ter it was found out [13, 14, 15] by randall and sundrum (rs) that such approach can
also be applied to solve the hierarchy problem of particle physics. in the rs model, our
four-dimensional world is regarded as a 3-brane embedded in ve-dimensional space-
time. it is also shown [10, 14] that such model with noncompact extra space reproduces
newtons 1/r2 law of four-dimensional gravity with experimentally unobservable cor-
rection from the (extremely suppressed) contribution of the continuum of massive kk
modes.

the ansatz for the ve-dimensional spacetime metric used in the rs model is the

1

one with the warp factor, where the four-dimensional part has the conformal factor
depending on the extra spatial coordinate. such metric can also be regarded as the
metric of domain wall. namely, the spacetime metric of the rs model is that of
ve-dimensional non-dilatonic domain wall, which is supported by the cosmological
constant in ve-dimensions. in this paper, we consider the case of dilatonic domain
walls with arbitrary dilaton coupling parameter in any spacetime dimensions. (some
aspects of dilatonic generalization of the rs model are also studied, for example, in
refs.
[16, 17, 18].) we study trapping of matter near the domain wall and the kk
spectrum of the graviton in the dilatonic domain wall background. we also construct
fully localized supergravity solutions describing various extreme solitons living inside
of the dilatonic domain walls, by applying the formalism studied in ref. [19]. these
solutions are valid for any region in spacetime, not just in the region close to the domain
walls.

the paper is organized as follows.

in section 2, we discuss aspects of dilatonic
domain wall solution, especially in relation to the idea on noncompact internal space.
in section 3, we construct fully localized supergravity solutions describing extreme
dilatonic branes within the extreme dilatonic domain walls. in section 4, we construct
fully localized supergravity solutions describing the bps branes within the bps domain
walls in string theories.

2 dilatonic domain walls

in this section, we discuss supergravity solution for a general dilatonic domain wall in
d-dimensional spacetime and its role as an alternative to the conventional kk theory
with noncompact internal space.

we start by summarizing a general dilatonic p-brane solution in d spacetime di-
mensions, since we are interested in obtaining supergravity solutions describing branes
inside of the worldvolume of domain walls. the einstein-frame action for the dilatonic
p-brane with the dilaton coupling parameter ap in d spacetime dimensions is

where d is the d-dimensional einstein gravitational constant,  is the dilaton, fp+2 =
dap+1 is the eld strength of the (p+1)-form potential ap+1. the supergravity solution
to the eld equations of the einstein-frame action (1) for the extreme dilatonic p-
brane with the longitudinal coordinates x = (x1, ..., xp) and the transverse coordinates
y = (y1, ..., ydp1) located at y = 0 has the following form:

the dilatonic domain wall with the dilaton coupling parameter a in d spacetime
dimensions corresponds to the p = d2 case of the general dilatonic p-brane discussed
in the above. namely, a domain wall in d spacetime dimensions can be regarded as a
(d2)-brane, electrically charged under the (d1)-form potential ad1. by applying
a poincare dualization, one can replace the d-form eld strength fd = dad1 by the
cosmological constant . so, the action (1) with p = d  2 can be rewritten as

the einstein-frame solution to the eld equations of the action (4) for the extreme

here, the parameter q in the harmonic function h is related to the cosmological
constant  in the action (4) through

.

(7)

note, unlike the case of other type of branes, one can always remove the constant term
in the above harmonic function h for the domain wall by applying the coordinate
translation along the y-direction, and the solution can be written with dierent powers
of harmonic function through the coordinate transformations [20]. in this paper we
choose the transverse coordinate such that the solution has the standard form that
would be obtained by taking the p = d  2 limit of dilatonic p-brane solutions.

in general, matter in the d-dimensional spacetime with the following form of metric

with the warp factor w (z):

gdxdx = w (z)hdt2 + dx2

1 +    + dx2

d2i + dz2

(8)

is trapped inside of the (d 1)-dimensional sub-spacetime with the coordinates (x) =
(t, x1, ..., xd2) for a suitable form of the warp factor w (z). to see [6] this classically, we

3

consider a particle with the d-momentum p = (p 0, p i, p z) moving in this spacetime.
the killing vectors for this spacetime are /t and /xi (i = 1, ..., d  2). so, the
constants of motion for the particle are



e =  p,
pi =  p,

t!
t! = p g   
xi!
xi! = p g   



= p 0w (z),

= p iw (z).

the invariant mass m of the particle in this spacetime is dened as

m 2 = p gp  = w (z)(p 0)2 + w (z)(p i)2 + (p z)2.

(9)

(10)

therefore, the momentum p z of the particle in the direction z of the extra space is
given by

p z = qe2w 1  m 2  p2w 1,

(11)
where p = (pi). the particle is trapped within the (d 1)-dimensional spacetime, i.e.,
the motion of the particle along the z-direction is restricted inside of a nite interval
around z = 0, if the energy e of the particle is bounded above by the potential due to
gravity:

e < qm 2w (z) + p2.

(12)

one can bring the spacetime metric in eq. (5) for the dilatonic domain wall to the

form (8) by redening the transverse coordinate in the following way:

z = sgn(y)

= sgn(y)

(d  2)

2(d  1) + (d  2)
a2(d  2)2  4(d  1)

a2(d  2)2

q1(cid:20)(1 + q|y|)
q1(cid:20)(1 + q|y|)

2(d1)+(d2)

(d2)

 1(cid:21)
a2(d2)2  1(cid:21) .

4

(13)

then, the dilatonic domain wall metric takes the form (8) with the warp factor given
by

w (z) =  1 +
=  1 +

2(d  1) + (d  2)

(d  2)
a2(d  2)2

a2(d  2)2  4(d  1)

4

2(d1)+(d2)

q|z|!
q|z|!

8

a2(d2)2

.

(14)

this warp factor for the dilatonic domain wall metric monotonically increases as one
moves away from the wall and goes to innity as |z|  , if a2 > 4(d  1)/(d  2)2.
so, matter inside of d-dimensional spacetime of the dilatonic domain wall will always
be trapped within the (d  1)-dimensional sub-spacetime by gravity, even if the extra

4

space with the coordinate z can have an innite extend. this mechanism provides with
an alternative to the ordinary kk theories where the spacetime is assumed to be of
the form of the direct product md  k of the d-dimensional spacetime md and some
compact space k.

this trapping of matter due to gravitational potential well can also be seen [11]
by considering the klein-gordon equation 2 = m 2 for a massive scalar  in
the background of dilatonic domain wall (8) with the warp factor (14).
if we let
 = w (3d)/2(z)(x), then the above klein-gordon equation takes the following form
of the klein-gordon equation for a scalar (x) in (d  1)-dimensional at spacetime
with varying mass as one moves along the direction perpendicular to the domain wall:

 = (cid:20)m 2w (z) +

d  3

2

w (z)(cid:21) ,

(15)

where the prime denotes derivative with respect to z. so, if a2 > 4(d  1)/(d  2)2,
then the mass of the (d1)-dimensional scalar (x) increases as one moves away from
the domain wall, implying that the scalar  is in the potential well centered around
z = 0. when a2 < 4(d  1)/(d  2)2, the minimum of the potential well is rather
away from the wall, i.e. at |z| = [4(d  1)/(a2(d  2)2)  1]q1, which moves away
from the domain wall as the dilaton coupling parameter a approaches zero. this is
also true for the case of a particle moving in the domain wall background, discussed
in the previous paragraph. as we will discuss in the following paragraph, this critical
value a2 = 4(d  1)/(d  2)2 for the dilaton coupling parameter also corresponds to
the critical value beyond which the -function potential in the schrodinger equation
satised by the metric perturbation becomes either repulsive or attractive. namely,
when a2 > 4(d1)/(d2)2, the minimum of the potential well for a particle or massive
scalar is located at the domain wall and the -function potential in the schrodinger
equation becomes an innite barrier, but when a2 < 4(d  1)/(d  2)2, the minima of
the potential well is located away from the domain wall and the -function potential
in the schrodinger equation becomes attractive.

in the following, we study the kk spectrum of graviton in the dilatonic domain wall
background. we consider the following general metric describing the small uctuation
h(x, u) of the (d  1)-dimensional minkowski sub-spacetime of the conformally at
d-dimensional spacetime of the dilatonic domain wall:

gdxdx = (u)h( + h) dxdx + du2i ,

(16)

where |h|  1. the conformally at form of the spacetime metric (eq. (16) with
h = 0) can be achieved from the dilatonic domain wall metric in eq. (5) by applying
the following coordinate transformation:

u = sgn(y)

the (, )-component of the einstein equations (resulting from the action which also
contains the worldvolume action for the domain wall) in the transverse traceless lorentz

in terms of new eld (u) = (d2)/4(u)(u), eq. (20) takes the following form of

(23)

this kk potential expression has the similar form as that of the non-dilatonic domain
wall of ref. [14] up to the coecients. however, there are some qualitative dierences
in the kk modes depending on the signs of the coecients in the kk potential (23).
first of all, since the kk potential falls o to zero as |u|  , there is no mass gap
in the massive kk spectrum just as in the case of non-dilatonic domain wall. when
 < 1, i.e., a2 < 2d/(d  2)2, the coecient in the rst term of the kk potential
is positive and the coecient of the -function term is negative. so, in addition to a

6

single normalizable bound state zero mode (identied as the four-dimensional graviton)
due to the attractive -function potential, there is the continuum of massive kk modes
which asymptote to plane waves as |u|   (since v (u)  0 as |u|  ) and are
suppressed as the origin is approached (due to the potential barrier near u = 0). when
1 <  < 0, i.e., 2d/(d  2)2 < a2 < 4(d  1)/(d  2)2, the coecient of the rst
term in the kk potential becomes negative, whereas the coecient in the -function
term still remains negative. so, in addition to the continuum of massive modes, now
there are discrete bound states of tachyonic modes, because the rst term of the kk
potential is of the form of the negative energy potential well. note, the rst term in
the kk potential no longer provides with potential barrier near u = 0. finally, when
 > 0, i.e., a2 > 4(d  1)/(d  2)2, the coecient in the rst term is negative and
the coecient in the -function term becomes now positive. the repulsive -function
potential at the origin therefore provides with innite potential barrier at u = 0.

3 extreme dilatonic branes inside of extreme dila-

tonic domain wall

in this section, we construct fully localized supergravity solutions describing extreme
dilatonic branes within the worldvolume of extreme dilatonic domain walls. schemat-
ically, the congurations under consideration are given by the following table:

brane

here, t is the time coordinate, w = (w1, ..., wp) is the overall longitudinal coordinates,
x = (x1, ..., xdp2) is the relative transverse coordinates for the brane and y is the
overall transeverse coordinate. these notations for the coordinates will be followed in
this and the next sections.

such brane congurations are described by the theory which contains the d-dimensional

graviton ge
 (,  = 0, 1, ..., d  1), the dilaton , (p + 1)-form potential ap+1 with the
eld strength fp+2 = dap+1, which p-brane (p < d  2) couples to, and the (d  1)-
form potential ad1, whose eld strength fd = dad1 dualizes to the cosmological
constant term which supports domain wall solution. the einstein-frame action which
describes such theory has the following form:

the harmonic functions hp and h for the p-brane and the domain wall satisfy the

a general solution for the harmonic function h to the second equation in eq. (27)
has the form h = 1 + q|y|. however, by applying the coordinate translation y 
y  sgn(y)q1 along the y-direction, one can remove the constant term in h. in this
case, the harmonic functions that solve eq. (27) are given by [19]

note, these expressions for harmonic functions are valid for any values of x and y.
to bring the harmonic function h to the original form, one translates back y  y +

functions:

4 bps solitons inside of bps domain walls in string

theories

in this section, we construct fully localized supergravity solutions describing the bps
solitons inside of the bps domain walls which are obtained by compactifying intersect-
ing branes in string theories. we shall compactify various partially localized intersect-
ing bps brane solutions constructed in ref. [19] to obtain such supergravity solutions.
because the congurations considered in this section (and also those considered in the
previous section) describe branes inside of another brane and the dimensionality of the
overall transverse space is suciently small, the corresponding supergravity solutions
are completely localized. moreover, these solutions describe the eld congurations in
the region at arbitrary distance from the domain walls.

generally, the einstein-frame action for a brane in string theory has the following

form:

where ge
m n (m, n = 0, 1, ..., 9) is the einstein-frame spacetime metric,  is the ten-
dimensional dilaton and fp+2 is the eld strength of the (p + 1)-form potential ap+1.
here, the value of the dilaton coupling parameter b is -1/2 for the ns-ns 2-form
potential and (p 3)/4 for the rr (p + 1)-form potential. the following string-frame
action is obtained through the weyl rescaling transformation ge

we shall compactify some of the longitudinal and the transverse directions of the
intersecting brane congurations to obtain the congurations describing the bps soli-
tons inside of domain walls. since, generally, the spacetime metric of intersecting brane
solutions are diagonal, the kk ansatz for the string-frame metric is

(gs

(36)

where gs
 (,  = 0, 1, ..., d  1) is the string-frame metric in d spacetime dimensions
and gmn (m, n = 1, ..., 10  d) is the internal metric. the d-dimensional dilaton 
is expressed in terms of the ten-dimensional dilaton  and the internal metric gmn as
follows:

after obtaining the string-frame metric gs
 for a d-dimensional solution by using the
simple compactication ansatz (36), one can apply the weyl-scaling transformation
 = e 4
ge
 for the solution. in addition
to the metric, the dilaton and the form-potential, the compactied d-dimensional
action has additional scalars associated with the internal metric gmn, unlike the case of
dilatonic p-branes inside of dilatonic domain walls considered in the previous section.
as a consequence, the dilaton coupling parameter for p-branes in string theories are
not restricted by the constraint in eq. (26)

 to obtain the einstein-frame metric ge

ln det gmn.

(37)

supergravity solutions for branes in string theories have the following convenient
properties, which simplify the study of brane solutions in d < 10 signicantly. first,
the einstein-frame solution for the spacetime metric depends only on the spacetime
dimensions d and the dimensionality p of the brane, independently of the type of form
potential under which brane is charged. second, in the case of the rr-charged p-
branes in d < 10, expressions for the spacetime metric and the d-dimensional dilaton
are insensitive to their origin in d = 10. namely, for example, the spacetime metric
and the d-dimensional dilaton for rr 2-brane in d = 6 have the same form whether
they are obtained by compactifying one longitudinal direction and three transverse
directions of d3-brane or they are obtained by compactifying four transverse directions
of d2-brane.

the universal forms of the einstein-frame metrics for a p-brane and a domain wall

in string theories in d < 10 are as follows:

this is the  = 4 case of the spacetime metric for a general dilatonic domain

therefore, the einstein-frame spacetime metrics for the d-dimensional congurations
describing the bps branes inside of the worldvolume of the bps domain walls in string
theories have the following universal forms:

scalars originated from the internal components of the spacetime metric are dierent
for dierent types of branes and compactications.

whereas the einstein-frame spacetime metrics have the universal forms (as discussed
in the above), the expressions for string-frame spacetime metrics are dierent for dif-
ferent types of form-elds under which the branes are charged. so, in the following
subsections, we present the expressions for the string-frame spacetime metric, as well
as the dilaton, for various cases.

4.1 bps solitons within the rr domain walls

in this subsection, we write down the expressions for the string-frame metrics and the
dilatons of supergravity solutions describing various bps solitons in the worldvolume
of the domain wall charged under the rr form-potential.

first, we consider the congurations where the rr charged p-brane is inside of the
worldvolume of the rr domain walls. supergravity solutions for such congurations
are obtained by compactifying the partially localized supergravity solutions describing
two dp-branes self-intersecting over (p  2)-dimensions, dp-brane ending on d(p + 2)-
brane and dp-brane inside of d(p + 4)-brane. the string-frame metric and the dilaton
eld have the following forms:

second, the supergravity solutions describing the electric ns-ns charged p-brane
(p = 0, 1) inside of the worldvolume of the rr domain wall are obtained by compact-
ifying the partially localized supergravity solution describing the fundamental string
ending on d-branes. the string-frame metric and the dilaton have the following forms:

volume of the rr domain wall is obtained by compactifying the partially localized

in this subsection, we write down the expressions for the string-frame metrics and
the dilatons of supergravity solutions describing various bps solitons living in the
worldvolume of the domain wall magnetically charged under the ns-ns form-potential.

ns-ns domain wall are obtained by compactifying the partially localized supergravity
