abstract

in this paper, we investigate about two classes of physically distinct worldvolume
solutions describing the propagation of an arbitrary brane probe in the presence of
another arbitrary brane as the source of the supergravity background. one of these
classes concerns a relatively moving parallel conguration of two at branes, while
the other class is related to a static conguration in which one of the branes is
at and the other is curved as a cylindrical hypersurface. global symmetries of
the worldvolume theory are used to show that both types of these solutions can
be described as a set of planner orbits which are parametrized by their energy
and angular momentum (e, l) variables. the various phases of these orbits, for
diernt values of (e, l), are distinguished from the graph of an energy-dependent
function of a single variable, which is related to the eective potential between the
two branes.

1 introduction

the description of the composite systems of branes [1, 2, 3] in terms of the source and
probe (s-p) congurations has been proved to be a useful device for investigating about
the properties of the intersecting brane congurations [4, 5, 6]. as the analysis of ref.[4]
shows, describing a system of branes in this manner, one can nd a subset of the eld
constraints (the no-force conditions) that x the supergravity solution for a marginal
conguration of at intersecting or overlapping branes. moreover, by this analysis sev-
eral algebraic constraints, arising naturally as a the consistency conditions in the study
of the supergravity eld equations, get interpretations in terms of the balancing between
the various internal long-range forces. in an equivalent picture, these can be interpreted
as the balancing conditions among the forces that act between the whole brane system
and external brane probes of the various types existing within the system of branes [4].
a similar approach in systems of branes at angles reveals that the only marginal congu-
rations with at branes at (non-trivial) angles are those constructed from similar branes
with two angles in a subgroup of su(2) [7]. from the viewpoint of the supergravity
theory, these congurations preserve 1/4 of the spacetime susy [8, 9]. there exist, how-
ever, other congurations of the intersecting branes making more than two angles but still
preserve some susy fraction [8, 10]. these congurations are stable only when certain re-
lations (which embody the above su(2) relation) hold between their angles [10, 11]. such
congurations, are found in ref.[7] that, can not be made up of a set of at p-branes.
indeed, they consist of a set of curved p-branes which only asymptotically look like the
at intersecting (overlapping) branes with denite angles. this agrees with a result of
ref.[12] that the supergravity solutions for the non-orthogonal intersecting branes of the
distributed type at non su(2) angles are not realizable in terms of a set of harmonic func-
tions. however, the existence of such curved intersections raises the question for nding
the corresponding worldvolume solutions. this generally denes a dicult problem which
involves solving simultaneously the coupled set of the supergravity and the worldvolumes
eld equations. as everybody knows, even the more simplied but analogue problem for
two charged particles in a at spacetime has not an exact solution. in a limiting case,
however, the problem is simplied and can be handled using the s-p description. this
is the viewpoint that we sall follow in this paper to study a special class of the curved
congurations which we name as the mono-dimensional solutions. the organization of
the paper is as follows: the general set up of the problem together with the required no-
tations are mentioned in section 2. then in section 3, the symmetries of the worldvolume
theory and its noether currents, in connection to a class of its solutions named as the
orbits, are studied. sections 4,5,6 are devoted to a detailed analysis of the orbits in three
dierent cases of the source and probe dimensions on the basis of the conservation equa-

1

tions mentioned in section 3. the paper ends with some concluding remarks in section
7.

2 some general remarks

the basic ingredient in the analysis of a system of (s,p) branes (the source and probe
respectively) is that while the (worldvolume) geometry of the p brane is inuenced by
the elds that originate from the s brane, the former does not have a signicant reaction
eect on the geometry of the latter. classical mechanically, such a condition is satised,
if one of the two branes (the s brane) is much heavier than the other brane (the p
brane). in a s-p system of two bps (1/2 susy) branes (having both their masses and
charges in proportion to their tensions [5, 6]), thus the s brane must have a large tension
compared to the p brane. there are other occasions, however, that while the above
condition on tensions is not satised, one still can use the s-p description. one example
consists of the marginally bound bps congurations with at p-branes satisfying certain
no-force conditions [4, 5, 13]. generally, a bps brane with a small (extrinsic) curvature
in the background of another bps brane can be treated (in this same order) as a pair
of (p,s) branes. another example concerns the near to the intersection points of two
p-branes where the self-interactions on each of the branes have a negligible amplitude
compared to the mutual interactions between the two branes. in usual, a at p-brane
of the bps type is a classically stable object obeying certain no-force conditions which
prevent its collapsing due to self-gravitational forces. when the p-brane is curved, the
self-interaction forces counterbalance each other and cause the oscillations to initiate. in a
s-p description, however, we deal with a limiting situation where all the self-oscillations
of the p brane, as well as its curving eects on the s brane geometry are negligible. as a
result, the analysis for a s-p conguration with a pair of bps branes proceeds by studying
the worldvolume (dbi+wz) action of the p brane, in which the background elds have
to be replaced by the elds associated to a at (and static) s brane.
in general, the
analysis consists of three dierent branches corresponding to the relative status of the
worldvolume dimensions (ds, dp) of the (s,p) branes. in each of theses cases, however, the
analysis also depends on the type (electric/magnetic) of the participating branes. for the
purpose of this paper we restrict our study to the states with both electric (s,p) branes;
the magnetic (or mixture) states then follow from dualizing these states. the general
supergravity background for a (bps) (d  1)-brane source consists of [5, 6]

(1)

ds2 = h d/ d(h1dxdx + mndymdyn)
e = h 
a = h1d1

=0dx

2

here x and ym are parallel and transverse coordinates of the s brane, and h is a

harmonic function:

h(y) = 


1 + q/|y| d
q ln|y|

,
,

d 6= 0
d = 0

(2)

where |y|2 = ymym and q is (proportional to) the form-eld charge of the brane. all other
d := d  d, d is the spacetime
notations are those of [4], in particular: d := d  2,
dimension and  is a measure of coupling between  and a in supergravity, which is
related to d as: [5, 6]

on the other hand the worldvolume action for a (d  1)-brane probe (having equal mass
and charge in units with 16gd = 1) has the general form [5, 14]:

2(d) = 1  d d/2 d

(3)

sd = tdz ddedet1/2(gab) + tdz a(d)

(4)

where gab and a are pull-backs of the spacetime metric and the d-form potential, on
the d-volume of the probe, respectively. on occasion, when ds = dp (ds 6= dp), the last
(wz) term has a non-vanishing (vanishing) contribution to sd. this action describes
the dynamics of the embedding coordinates x m = x m () through the dependences of
, gab,a on these coordinates. in the following sections,however, we use a subset (xa) of
the spacetime coordinates (xm ) (parallel or perpendicular to the source) to parameterize
the worldvolume of the p brane and use the rest subset (ya) as the embedding coordinates
[so, (xa, ya)  (x, ym)]. the above action then reads

sd = tdz ddxl(y a, ay a)

(5)

where the form of the embedding lagrangian (l) changes depending on the relative status
of ds and dp (see below).

3 symmetries of l and the orbits
without going to the detailed expression of l in the specic cases, the at geometry of
the s brane a priori implies that this lagrangian must possess a number of obvious global
symmetries. these symmetries include the translational and rotational invariances along
the worldvolume of the s brane as well as the rotational invariance along its transverse
directions which are respectively dened as:

x = 
x = 
 x
x = 0

,

,

,

ym = 0
ym = 0
ym = mnyn

( +  = 0)

(mn + nm = 0)

(6)

(7)

(8)

3

though all of these symmetries have natural interpretations as the spacetime (bulk)
symmetries, in the worldvolume theory some of them are realized as pure internal sym-
metries changing y a(xa)s but not aecting on xa. the three cases with ds <=> dp are
common in the above symmetries, though they are dierent in the way that one denes
(xa, ya). in each of the above cases they are dened as follows:

ds = dp

ds > dp

ds < dp

:

:

:

,

x = xa
x = (xa, yi)
xa = (x, yi)

ym = ya

,

,

ym = ya
ym = (ya, yi)

(9)

here (yi) represents a subset of the coordinates parallel (perpendicular) to the s brane
which we shall take them as a part of the parameterizing (embedding) coordinates, in the
case with ds > dp (ds < dp). the corresponding noether currents for each of these cases
are then constructed using the formula [15]:

j a =

l
y a
,a

(y a  xbby a) + lxa

(10)

the conservation equations of the noether currents are useful tools in the analysis of the
classical solutions of the worldvolume theory (5) for a particular class of them depending
only on a single space or time coordinate. for the reason that becomes clear, we refer to
such solutions as the orbits of the p brane and denote by x the space or time coordinate
that parameterizes an orbit. for such a conguration, the action (5) for the worldvolume
eld theory reduces to a mechanical type action of the form

s = z dxl(y a, y a)

(11)

y a := dy a/dx, and l(y a, y a) (up to a constant factor) is the
where y a = y a(x),
same as l(y a, ay a) in which all derivatives of y a other than y a are set equal to
zero. depending on that x is a space- or time-like coordinate the resulting solution
has a dierent interpretation. when x is space-like, y a(x) describes a cylindrical static
conguration of the p brane, whose all directions except one are parallel to the s brane.
when x is time-like, y a(x) describes the path of the motion for a p brane remaining
parallel to a s brane and moving transverse to it. in the subspace transverse to all of
the xa directions, the conguration (of the p brane) dened by y a = y a(x) is projected
into a curve which looks like the orbit of a point particle moving within a spherically
symmetric potential. the adjective space- (time-)like for the orbits then signies that
the corresponding curve in the subspace of (x, ya) is space- (time-)like, meaning that
x itself is a space- (time-)like coordinate. for both classes of such mono-dimensional
solutions, the equations of motion of (11) can be more easily integrated using a set of

4

conservation laws that follow from the currents corresponding to the symmetries (6)-(8).
generically, for an orbit depending on x, a conservation low as aj a = 0 yields

dj x
dx

= 0

(12)

which identies the component j x of the current as a conserved charge along the orbit.
we will see in the following sections that these conserved charges provide the sucient
information required for integrating the equations of motion for y a(x). then we observe
that the orbits are eectively characterized by the 2-dimensional motion of a point par-
ticle in the newtonian mechanics whose dierent phases of motion are determined by an
eective potential depending on two (energy and angular momentum) parameters. the
analysis then proceeds via a set of (phase) diagrams depending only on the energy pa-
rameter, and reveals a variety of regimes (phases of the eective motion) for orbits with
various parameters. we study the three cases with ds <=> dp through separate analyses
in the next three sections.

4 the s-p system with ds = dp

in this case the 1st row of (9) denes (xa, ya) and the lagrangian l, using eqs.(1)-(4), for
a general conguration is written as

l = h1(y )[det1/2(

 + h(y )y my m)  ]

(13)

where  = +1(1) for a brane-brane (b-b)[brane-antibrane (b-a)] s-p conguration
(note that in this case the two branes see the form-elds of each other via a force de-
pending on their relative orientation; the sign of  reects this orientation). the conserved
currents in this case consist of:

t 

 =

l
y m
,

,  
y m
l
m  = xt   xt 
,  y n l
y m
,

mn = y m l
j 
y n

,

,

,

t  = 0

m  = 0

j 

mn = 0

(14)

(15)

(16)

which in correspondence to the symmetries (6)-(8) have to be identied as the energy-
momentum, longitudinal and transverse angular momentum tensors respectively. since
the conservation of m  naturally follows from that of t , only the eqs.(14) and (16)
are taken as the informative parts of the conservation laws for this analysis. going to the
mono-dimensional solutions, the lagrangian (13) becomes

l = h1[(1 + h y 2)1/2  ]

5

(17)

where  = +1(1), if x is a space- (time-)like coordinate and y 2 := y m y m. the corre-
sponding conserved charges, according to eqs.(12),(14),(16), are

e = y m l

j mn = y m l

1

 y m  l = h1
 y n  y n l
 y m

q1 + h y 2
 

(y m y n  y n y m)
= 
q1 + h y 2

(18)

(19)

for a time-like orbit ( = 1), e and j mn have obvious interpretations as the energy and
the (transverse) angular momentum tensor (of the p brane) respectively. for a space-like
orbit ( = +1), however, they have to be interpreted as the ows of the respective quan-
tities along the orbit (x) direction 2.
as in the ordinary 3d particle mechanics, one expects that the angular momentum con-
servation restricts the dimension of the orbits (hyper)planes. such a property is in fact a
result of the equation(s) obtained from eq.(19) by eliminating the velocities; that is

j mny p + j npy m + j pmy n = 0

(20)

where distinguished equations are obtained for distinct values of m, n, p = 1, ..., m with
m := ds + 2. so, the orbit y m = y m(x) lies at the common intersection of a set of
(m  1)-dimensional hyperplanes dening the orbit plane. the (maximum) number of
independent equations of the form eq.(20) thus xes the (maximum) dimension of the
orbit plane. for m > 3 one can show that this plane, just as in the newtonian particle
mechanics, is a 2-dimensional plane, provided 3

j 12j 34 + j 13j 42 + j 14j 23 = 0,

etc.

(21)

further, when (all) j mn = 0, the orbit plane degenerates to a straight line or a single
point. by rotating the ym coordinates, so that the orbit plane coincides with the y1y2-
plane, all j mns except j 12 are transformed to zero (obviously, such j mns obey eq.(21)).
using the polar coordinates (r, ) in the y1y2-plane, the conservation laws (18),(19) will
read

2it is easy to check that in both cases t 

x = e and its all other diagonal
components are equal to (l). so, for  = 1, e is the energy while for  = +1 it is a component of the
(anisotropic) pressure along the x direction.

of eq.(21) is not required.

these two equations, in principle, determine the orbit up to the integrations

x = z r

where the choice of the + () sign corresponds to an incoming (outgoing) eective radial
motion. solving eqs. (26),(27) for (r(x), (x)) then species the form of the projection
of the p brane as a 3d curve in the (x, y1, y2) subspace. however, the shape of the orbit
in the y1y2-plane can be directly determined by solving a dierential equation, obtained
from eqs.(24),(25), as

d!2
  dr

u(r)
2(r)

=

r2
l2 [f (r)  l2]

where f (r) is dened in terms of h(r) as

f (r) := r2[2e + e2h(r)]

in terms of this function, u(r) and (r) (eqs.(24),(25)) are expressed as

u(r) =

(r) =

e2r2(f (r)  l2)
(f (r) + er2)2

le

f (r) + er2

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

4.1 the eective one-dimensional motion

eq.(24) is similar to an energy conservation equation for the 1-dimensional (radial) motion
of a point particle within an external force eld derivable from the potential  1
2 u(r) and
with x identied as the time variable. except for a few examples, explicit integration
of this equation for r(x) is generally impossible. however, as in many other dynamical
systems, the qualitative behavior of the solution and its dierent phases are distinguishable
from a set of phase diagrams; i.e. the curves describing the motion in the (r, r) plane.
these curves are, in eect, the symmetrized version of the u(r) diagrams for dierent
values of the (e, l) parameters. however, a more simplied discussion of the eective

7

motion proceeds via studying the diagrams for f (r) which are dependent only on the
e parameter. the expression of eq.(30) for u(r) shows that the allowed region of the
eective radial motion are specied by the values of r satisfying the inequality

u(r)  0



f (r)  l2

(32)

within every connected region of r with this property, the eective particle moves in a
denite direction (depending on the sign in eq.(26)) under the radial force 1
2u(r), until it
reaches to an end-point of the interval, where its velocity vanishes and (provided the force
is still non-vanishing) reverses its direction. obviously, such turning points are dened
by

in addition, the positivity of the square root in in eq.(22) requires that

f (r0) = l2

,

f (r0) 6= 0

 + eh(r) > 0

(33)

(34)

by eq.(25), this result implies that the angular velocity (r) has a denite sign (depend-
ing on l), which is an indication of a monotonic angular motion around the origin. by
eqs.(2) and (29), the explicit expression for f (r) is

(ar2  b/rm4)
 (cr2 + br2 ln r)

,
,

m 6= 2
m = 2

f (r) = 


where the various parameters are dened as4:

a := 2e  e2

,

b := e2q ,

c := 2e

(35)

(36)

for each specic situation (i.e. a case with a specic m, , ), xing the energy e of the p
brane species the shape of the graph for f (r). changing l2, as the height of a horizontal
line on this graph, then according to eq.(32), species various allowed regimes of the
eective motion. studying through the various transverse dimensions (m) will reveal a
variety of regimes for the eective motion. evidently, in all cases that f (r)  0 (r  0),
one necessarily has l = 0 and in such a case any constant values of (r, ) specify a solution
of the equations of motion. such a solution, which is the same as a multi-center solution
for two parallel branes, can be formed at any arbitrary separation of the two branes
dening a marginal conguration [6, 3]. by eqs.(35),(36), such a conguration is achieved
only for e = 0, i.e. for a zero binding energy.

4.2 qualitative description of the orbits

the following qualitative descriptions are deduced from the inspection of the the graphs
of f (r) in fig.(1), which are sketched for the space-like orbits, and those for the time-like
orbits which are obtained by reversing these graphs (not shown). the parameter a in
these diagrams is related to the energy parameter e as in the eq.(36).

space-like orbits ( = +1)

for all the transverse dimensions m  3, these orbits share the common feature that,
for all values of l, they have extensions to the innite region r   and pass through
a minimum distance (r0) relative to the source. they are all symmetric around their
minimum points and make a nite angle () with respect to the x direction (see below).
all of these solitons are stable only for those combinations of (e, ) that leave a > 0.
for m = 1, which normally has l = 0, the orbit crosses the source (at r = 0) and passes
through a maximum distance (r0) and oscillates periodically along the x direction. the
stability in this case is also achieved for a > 0. the m = 2 case is distinguished by the
fact that the coordinate r possesses a natural bound r  1 so that h(r)  0 and the
transverse part of the metric remains positive. the corresponding orbits then oscillate
between r0  r  1, and are stable provided c > 0 (so that r0 < 1).

time-like orbits ( = 1)

unlike the space-like case, time-like diagrams in all of the three branches with a <=> 0
possess allowable regimes of motion. possible regimes are:

m  5 , a  0 : for all l2  0 the orbit is bound between 0  r  r0, though for

0, so that the orbits with l2 < l2

0 range between
0 two dierent regimes in: 0  r  r1 and r  r2 with the

0, the orbit is bound between 0  r  r0. larger values

a = 0 , l = 0 it extends to innity: 0  r < .
m  5 , a < 0 : there is a critical value l2
0  r < , while for l2  l2
same amounts of (e, l) are equally possible.
m = 4 , a > 0 : for each l2  l2
of l2 are not allowable.
m = 4 , a < 0 : for each l2  l2
ranges in r  r0.
m = 4 , a = 0 : for all l2 < l2
value l2 = l2
angular velocity.
m = 3 , a > 0 : for all l2 < l2
0 , the orbit is bound between r1 < r < r2. just for l2 = l2
0,
the two bounds coincide and the orbit becomes a circle with an energy dependent radius

0, the orbit is a spiral between 0 < r < . for the critical
0, it becomes a circle of arbitrary radius which is traversed with a constant

and angular velocity.
m = 3 , a  0 : for l 6= 0, the orbit ranges in r  r0, while for l = 0 it passes through
r = 0.
m = 2 , a <=> 0 : this is the analogue of the m = 3 , a > 0 case above.
m = 1 , a <=> 0 : this is the analogue of the m = 3 , a  0 case above, with the
dierence that when a > 0 the orbit never passes the origin even for l = 0.

4.3 quantitative features

4.3.1 the innite orbits

as the above description shows, (for both  = 1 cases) there are many regimes in which
the orbit extends to the innite region r  . the asymptotic behavior of such orbits
is deduced from the study of the asymptotic behaviors of u(r) and (r). for the present
purpose, we need only to the limiting values, which according to eqs.(30),(31),(35), are

u(r)  u0
(r)  0

(e+)2  1(cid:17)

m  3

(37)

(38)

where u0 = u0(e) is

u0 = 


these limiting values, according to the dierential eqs.(24),(25), correspond to straight

line asymptotic orbits, in the  = 0 planes, with a slope dr/dx = u0. this means
that, in all the cases with u0  0, the s-p system asymptotically looks like a pair of at
(d 1)-branes, with a relative rotation (boost) in one direction with an angle  (a velocity
v) satisfying

u0 = 


tan2
v2

,
,

 = +1
 = 1

(39)

consequently, the energy-dependences of  and v are determined by eq.(38). for
m = 1, this indicates that all values of e yield to a parallel static conguration of the
s&p branes at innite distances. for m  3, it gives

e +  =

accordingly, the allowed values of e for these innite orbits range as

  e  1

(m  3)

(40)

(41)

for  = +1, the bound e = 1   corresponds to an asymptotic parallel ( = 0) or
antiparallel ( = ) s-p conguration, while e =  corresponds to an asymptotic
orthogonal ( = /2) situation. for  = 1, the bound e = 1   corresponds to
an asymptotic static (v = 0) moving conguration, while e = + corresponds to an
asymptotic light-like (v = 1) motion. the values of e near these two extremes correspond
to the newtonian and relativistic limits respectively.

4.3.2 the circular orbits

among the graphs of fig.(1), regimes can be distinguished, for which the orbits have a
constant radius r = r. for each specic value of e, such an orbit (if any) is characterized
by the values of l2 that touch the extremum points of the graph for f (r), i.e.

f (r) = l0

2

,

f (r) = 0

(42)

noting to the sign of the eective force, the maximum (minimum) points of f (r) char-
acterize the stable (unstable) circular orbits. among the space-like cases with m  2,
we see that there are no circular orbits. among the time-like orbits, however, we nd a
special type of the circular orbits one for each dimension m  2. these consist of the
following cases:

m  5 , a < 0 ; unstable circular orbits:

the radius (r), angular momentum (l0), and angular velocity (0) of the orbits, by
eqs.(31),(35),(42), are found to be

it is amazing that the velocity v0 = r0 for these orbits turns to be independent of q.

m = 4 , a = 0 ; marginally stable circular orbits:

such orbits, having arbitrary radiuses, are special to the dimension m = 4 and occur for
very specic values of (e, l) which yield f (r)  l2 for all values of r. so, for such orbits
we must have

however, because of the e >  condition, only the  = 1 case (i.e. a b-a system with
e = 2) can possesses such marginally stable circular orbits. a circle of radius r in this
case is traversed with the angular velocity

despite the m  5 or m = 3 cases, the velocity on these circles does depend on q.
because of the natural bound r  1 in m = 2, for these orbits to be realized we must
have 4/eq < 1.

4.3.3 the orbits crossing the origin

amongst the various regimes, distinguishable from fig.(1), there are cases where the orbit
can approach, or pass through, the origin (r = 0). such regimes (orbits) are interesting,
since they give descriptions for branes that intersect with, and/or fall on each other. the
approach towards the origin may take place at nite or innite values of x. in the former
case, the two branes intersect or collide (depending on  = +1 or 1) and pass through
each other, while in the latter case they meet (and coincide) only asymptotically. for a
quantitative description, we consider space- and time-like orbits separately.

space-like case:

the only space-like orbit passing the origin occurs for m = 1 , a > 0. in such a case
(having naturally l = 0), we obtain a 1-dimensional periodic orbit which, several times
with a period l, intersects the x-axis and then goes through a maximum at r = r0. it is
easy to see that in this case u(r) has the form

u(r) = u0

1  r/r0
(1  r/r1)2
12

(47)

where r0 := (2 + e)/eq , r1 := ( + e)/eq (r0 > r1) and u0 is dened as in the
rst row of eq.(38). the period l of this orbit then is calculated as 5

l = 4z r0

(e)3/2[4  (1  e)(2 + e)1/2]

(48)

(note that 0 < e < 2, by a > 0). the periodicity of the orbit along the x-direction
hints that x may be a compactied coordinate, wrapped along a circle of radius l/2, in
which case the energy (stress) required for such a wrapping of the p brane around the
compact direction of the s brane is obtained by reversing the eq.(48) for e = e(l).

time-like case:

the origin crossing time-like orbits occur in each of the following situations:
(1) m  5, arbitrary e&l
2, arbitrary e
(2) m = 4, l2  l0
(3) m = 3, l = 0, , arbitrary e
(4) m = 2, l = 0, , arbitrary e
(5) m = 1 (l = 0), a(e)  0.
as was pointed above, the orbit may pass through the origin at a nite time in which
case its passage takes place several times with a denite period t ,

t = 2z r0

or it may tend to the origin during an innite fall time which is the characteristic of a

time is that the contribution to the above integral from the region r  0,

5the factor 4 in eq.(48) is related to the fact that the section curve of the the p brane y 1 = y 1(x)
can not involve a sharp turning point at y 1 = 0, but it contains two symmetric semi-cycles with their
turning points at y 1 = r0, since otherwise a -force at r = 0 would be required.

2 := e2q, 0 := l/eq. we have appended to this list a third column for angular
where l0
velocities near r = 0, so as to clarify the status of the angular motion in this vicinity.
from this list it is evident that all of the m  4 orbits have innite fall times (t  ).
however, while all m  5 orbits tend linearly (as   0) towards the origin, the m = 4
orbits approach spirally to that point (as   0). on the other hand, all m  3 orbits
tending to the origin have a nite fall time (t  0), and the corresponding motions are
in the form of periodic 1-dimensional oscillations around the origin (as   0).

5 the s-p system with ds > dp

here the second row of (9) denes (xa, ya). the lagrangian describing the mono-dimensional
solutions: y i = y i(x), y m = y m(x), with x being one of the xas, turns to be

l = hm/2[1 + ( y i)2 + h( y m)2]1/2

where the exponent m is a function of dimensions as

m := 2(ds)(dp) + dsdp/ d

(52)

(53)

with (d) dened in eq.(3). note that in eq.(52), h is a function only of y ms through
their modulus. as eq.(53) shows, m is a generally non-integer real number. however,
according to the intersection rule of the marginal brane intersections [4, 16], a pair of
(ds  1, dp  1)-branes (not necessarily a s-p conguration) sharing in a number (  1)
of their worldvolume directions constitutes a marginally stable conguration provided

combining eqs.(53),(54), one obtains

 = 2(ds)(dp) + dsdp/ d

m = dp  

(54)

(55)

showing that in such occasions m is a positive integer specifying the number of the (rota-
tion) angles between the two branes, when they are attened in all of their worldvolume
directions [4]. for an arbitrary situation, however one can see, using the relations of the
type of eq.(3), that m satises

for a marginal intersection, thus the only possibilities are m = 0, 1, 2.
the conserved quantities (charges) corresponding to the symmetries (6)-(8) consist of

by eqs.(57),(59) the velocity components in the yi-directions are conserved quantities.
owing to the lorenz invariance of the action (52) along the (x, yi) directions, one can
rotate these coordinates so as to obtain y i = 0. in such a lorenz frame, y is become
constant coordinates, which can be taken to be zero, and hence by eqs.(59),(60) one
obtains p i = j ij = 0. accordingly, the orbit y m = y m(x), y i(x) = 0 is described by
means of the two conservation laws (57),(58) now with y i = 0. just as in the case with
ds = dp, one can see that the orbit lies in a 2d plane spanned within the ym-directions.
choosing the polar coordinates (r, ) on this plane, in analogy to eqs.(22),(23), one obtains

hm/2+1(r)r2 

q1 + h(r)( r2 + r2 2)
q1 + h(r)( r2 + r2 2)

where r2 := y my m. in analogy to eqs.(24),(25), these two equations give

r2 = u(r) :=

where n := 2/(m  2). again the solutions for (r(x), (x)) are found by integrations as in
eqs.(26),(27) and the solution for r() is found directly from eq.(28). also, as eqs.(63),(64)
indicate, the orbital motion is composed of a monotonic angular motion around r = 0
and a radial motion within a range specied by the inequality (32). accordingly, the
qualitative description of the orbits, as in the past, proceeds via the study of the f (r)
diagrams sketched in figs.(2)-(6). by eq.(65), marginal a conguration of two parallel
branes in this case corresponds to the values m = 0, e = 1, l = 0.

15

5.1 an overall look on the orbits

a large variety of the regimes and phases of the eective radial motion are revealed,
when one travels through several transverse dimensions and changes the (the ranges of)
the three parameters (m, e2, l2). the corresponding diagrams for the function f (r) are
shown in figs.(2)-(6) for the case of the space-like orbits; the time-like case is covered by
reversing the same diagrams. as in the previous (ds = dp) case, all the dimensions m  5
with xed (m, e) share a common qualitative behavior. dierent behaviors appear for
m  4. some more or less novel features in this case are the appearance of the bound,
circular (stable/unstable), origin-crossing and innite orbits as well as the co-existing
phases of the bound and innite orbits in the dimensions m  1 and in both the space-
and time-like cases. a completely new behavior occurs for the case of the space-like orbits
in dimension m = 3, where f (r) possesses both a local min. and max. points. in such a
case (for suitable values of l2 ) a regime with co-existing phases of an origin-crossing and
a bound oscillatory orbits is realized. marginally stable circular orbits, like the previous
case, occur just for a particular time-like case in m = 4.

5.2 some quantitative features

5.2.1 the innite orbits

the cases with innitely extended orbits correspond to those values of (m, m, l, e, ) that
the solution to the inequality u(r)  0 includes the r   region. a variety of these
orbits (for all m 6= 2) are distinguishable among the figs.(2)-(6). it is easy to check,
as in the ds = dp case, that all such orbits also in this case exhibit a straight line-like
asymptotic behavior which is governed by the eqs.(37), where the parameter u0 is

(1  e2)/e2

(m  3)

u0 =



e = 


(67)

(68)

the allowed cases are those with u0  0. so, using eq.(39), one obtains

again, the dimension m = 1 exhibits an exceptional behavior: for m < 1 (m > 1) the
(s,p) branes are asymptotically perpendicular (parallel) to each other, while for m = 1
they make an asymptotic angle  = tan1(1/e).

16

5.2.2 the circular orbits

despite the ds = dp case, here circular orbits of both the space- and time-like natures are
allowable for all m  2. several such orbits are distinguished by the extremum points of
the graphs in figs.(2)-(6) and are classied in the table (1) below. the symbols s, u and
ms in this table refer to the stable, unstable and marginally stable orbits respectively.

m = 3

each orbit in table (1) occurs only for a specic range of e and a suitable value of
l. the radius r of a circular orbit of energy e is determined, through its corresponding
value of h, by the equation

(1  m  n)h 1m  (1  m)hm + e2(n  1)h + e2 = 0

two distinguished behaviors occur in m = 3, 4 cases. for m = 3, m < 1, and at

e = em, h = hm with

m + 1

hm = s m  1
m = (cid:18)m  1

e2

m + 1(cid:19)(m+1)/2

(m  1)(m + m2  1)

(70)

the rst and second derivatives of f (h) simultaneously vanish and a semi-stable (space-
like) circular orbit of radius r = q/(hm  1) is obtained. in the range of energy 1 < e <
em, this orbit splits into a pair of stable and unstable circles at dierent radii at the same
value of e but dierent values of l2. for m = 4, m = 1, and at values e = 1, l2 = q ,
a marginally stable (time-like) circular orbit of arbitrary radius is realized. for the same
value of e but with l2 < q, this circle is deformed into a spiral curve of the form

r() = re

(71)

where  := q  l2/l and r is any arbitrary initial radius.

17

5.2.3 the coincident (s,p) congurations

in addition to the above mentioned nite size circular orbits, there exist other limiting
cases which are characterized by circles of zero radius with a vanishing, nite or innite
angular velocity. in a time-(space-)like situation, such a solution describes a coincident
(s,p) conguration in which the p brane, in some cases, has a non-vanishing spin (torsion)
equal to (r  0). such orbits, which are the r = 0 solutions to the equations of motion,
are specied by those values of the parameters satisfying

u(r  0) = 0 , u(r  0) = 0

(72)

the solution is stable (unstable) provided u(r  0) to be negative (positive). the
expansion of u(r) near r = 0 up to a few leading terms for dierent values of (m, m),
thus gives rise to a classication of the coincident (s,p) solutions as is indicated in table
(2) below.

table (2): coincident (s,p) solutions for ds > dp

as in table (1), each of the solutions in table (2) is achieved for a suitable range or
xed values of (e, l). as the rst row in this table shows, while the m = 4 solutions carry
a nite spin or torsion ( = 0 := l/eq), all the m  5 solutions are without spin and
torsion ( = 0). on the other hand the m = 3 solution has an innite torsion ( = )
which means that one of the p brane directions is crumpled (i.e.,wrapped on a circle of
vanishing radius) around the s brane directions.

5.2.4 the origin-crossing orbits

orbits of this type occur in cases where the solution to the inequality u(r)  0 involves
the r = 0 point. generically, such an orbit is bounded between r = 0 and r = r0, where
u(r0) = 0 (through in some cases r0  ). the origin may be crossed or approached

18

by the orbit depending on that the quantity dened in eq.(50) (which is denoted by x
below to include both the space- and time-like cases) vanishes or diverges respectively.
the various origin crossing orbits of both characters, for dierent values of (m, m), are
classied in table (3) below.

table (3): origin-crossing orbits for ds > dp

6 the s-p system with ds < dp

by dening (xa, ya) as in the third row of (9), the lagrangian l describing the embedding
coordinates y a = y a(x, yi) is found to be

l = hm/2det1/2(

 + hy ay a)det1/2(ij + iy ajy a)

where m is dened as in eq.(53) with (ds, dp) interchanged, i.e.

m := 2(ds)(dp) + ds dp/ d

(73)

(74)

when the marginality condition (54) is satised, in analogy to eq.(55), m coincides to
the number of the non-zero angles for marginal intersection:

m = ds  

(75)

a major dierence between this (ds < dp) case and the previous (ds  dp) ones is that
the lagrangian (73), unlike (13),(52), contains explicit dependences on (the subset yi of)
the parameterization coordinates (x, yi) themselves, through the dependence of h on

r = q(yi)2 + (ya)2

(76)

this property (generally) prevents the possibility of existing any mono-dimensional solu-
tion, which as in the previous cases depends only on one of the coordinates (x, yi). in
particular, parallel relatively moving congurations in this case are not allowable (this is
unlike to the situation where the roles of ds and dp are interchanged !). however, other in-
teresting possibilities for solutions of the lagrangian (73) exist which are explained below.

19

(semi-)cylindrical congurations:

interesting congurations occur when a number  of the at s brane directions are parallel,
and the rest (ds  ) of them are perpendicular, to a (generally) curved p brane. this
means that (for each a) a number  of the slopes y a are vanishing, while the rest
(ds  ) of them tend to innity 6. putting these values in eq.(73), one peaks up a factor
h (ds)/2 multiplied by a constant innite factor. thus, ignoring the irrelevant innity,
the dynamics of the coordinates y a = y a(yi) in this case is governed by

l = h (dsm)/2det1/2(ij + iy ajy a)

(77)

the case of a totally cylindrical conguration happens when all of the s brane directions
are common to the p brane, and is covered by the above lagrangian for  = ds.

curved marginal intersections:

an interesting subclass of the above semi-cylindrical solutions consist of the marginal
intersections in which one of the two branes (the p brane) is not necessarily at. to
see that such solutions exist, imagine a pair of branes which are capable of forming
a at marginal solution; that is they obey the rule (54). assuming a semi-cylindrical
conguration with  cylindrical directions, thus the lagrangian l becomes

l = det1/2(ij + iy ajy a)

(78)

which, unlike eq.(77), does not contain any trace of the spacetime curvature via depen-
dence on h. the classical solutions for this lagrangian do represent (dpds)-dimensional
minimal (hyper)surfaces in a ( ds + 2)-dimensional euclidean space parametrized by
(yi, ya). these surfaces are solutions to the laplace equation in the curved space,

gy a = 0

(79)
g iggijj and gij[y ] := ij + iy ajy a is the pull-back of the euclidean
where g := 1
( ds + 2)-dimensional metric on the minimal surface. for asymptotic at boundary con-
ditions, the only solutions to this equation are at surfaces identifying ordinary (at)
orthogonally intersecting s-p systems. for non-asymptotic at surfaces or surfaces with
non-planar boundaries, however, the above equation have non-trivial solutions leading to
the curved marginal intersections. in this manner, given every such minimal surface, we
can construct a solution of the original theory (73) simply by a cylindrical extension of
the minimal surface in some of the s brane directions.

6more precisely, the slopes for perpendicular xs are in the form of -functions at the corresponding

values of these coordinates.

20

7 conclusion

in this paper, we have considered the mono-dimensional worldvolume solutions for one a
pair of interacting branes in both the space- and time-like congurations, when the other
brane is kept xed and at (called as the p and s branes, respectively). for such solutions,
the s brane, which itself has a at worldvolume geometry, causes the worldvolume of the p
brane to be curved only in one of its (space- or time-like) directions. it was observed that
such a conguration is allowed only in cases where ds  dp. this, for example, implies that
when ds < dp, parallel (s,p) congurations in a relative transverse state of motion is not
stable and the motion imposes a curvature on (at least) one of the directions of the p brane.
in all the allowed cases, however, it was shown that the p brane worldvolume solutions of
this type can be described in terms of a set of planner orbits in the subspace transverse
to the s brane, which are parametrized by their energy (e) and angular momentum (l)
variables. these two parameters x the form of the solution up to any arbitrary rotation
(translation) along the transverse (parallel) directions of the s brane. these orbits possess
dierent phases, for dierent ranges of the parameters (e, l), corresponding to phases of
an eective 2d motion. these phases are qualitatively described in terms of a set of phase
diagrames, corresponding to dierent values of (e, l), or equivalently by the intersections
of the graph of an e-dependent function f (r) and a line of the constant height l2. the
eective potential  1
2u(r) and between (s,p) and their relative angular velocity (r)
as a function of the transverse distance r are closely related to this function. though this
function has dierent expressions in the cases with similar and non-similar branes, its
dependence on (ds, dp, d) always appear through the combinations (m, m) as

m = ds + 2
m = 2(ds)(dp) + dsdp/(d  2)

(80)

one of the features that the above analysis reveals is that all m  5 cases, for the same
values of (e, l), share common qualitative behaviors, while dierent behaviors appear in
m  4 cases. these diagrams also reveal several phases of the eective motion such as:
the bounded (oscillatory), unbounded (asymptotic free) and circular (rotating) regimes
for both the space- as well as time-like congurations. it should be remarked that, al-
though in the previous sections, we have considered the cases with ds = dp and ds 6= dp
as representing the congurations with two similar and non-similar branes, one can t
also some other cases of a two brane system in the same analysis. for example, in 10d
supergravity, either of the two congurations of (ns1,d1) and (ns5,ns1) branes can be
analyzed as in the ds 6= dp category (section 5). the reason, as can be checked, is that in
both these cases the the form-eld interaction of the two branes (the wz term in eq.(5))
has a vanishing contribution to their eective action. also it should be recognized that

21

the analysis in this paper ignors the contributions of the internal gauge elda as well as
the external b-eld in the dynamics of p-branes and treats all types of branes as obeying
similar dynamics. a possible extension of this work thus may be obtained by inclusion of
the above elds in the branes dynamics similar to the one which has been used recently
in ref.[17] to handle a (d3, d5) -branes as a (s,p) system in another geometry. as we
have mentioned in the introduction, looking for the exact form of the the p-branes in
a multi-angle asymptotic at intersection is our main motivation for writing this paper.
nevertheless, the solutions we have considered can not describe congurations with more
than one angle, similar to the ones in sections 4,5. these solutions, however, are not
concerning to the marginal multi-angle intersections introduced in ref.[10, 11]. for look-
ing for m-angle congurations, in general, one has to seek for the worldvolume solutions
of the p brane which depend on m of the directions of the s brane. accordingly, one
has to solve a set of second order pdes in m dimensions which unlike the 1-dimensional
case can not be integrated using its conservation equations. a perturbative approach in
ref.[7], however, shows that solutions of the marginal type for these congurations can be
found, provided that the marginality property is appropriately dened at innitly long
distances.
