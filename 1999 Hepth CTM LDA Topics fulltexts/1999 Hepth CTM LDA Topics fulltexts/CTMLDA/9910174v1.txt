abstract: a brane universe moving in a curved higher dimensional bulk space
is considered. the motion induces a cosmological evolution on the universe brane
that is indistiguishable from a similar one induced by matter density on the brane.
the phenomenological implications of such an idea are discussed. various mirage
energy densities are found, corresponding to dilute matter driving the cosmological
expansion, many having superluminal properties |w| > 1 or violating the positive
energy condition. it is shown that energy density due to the world-volume elds is
nicely incorporated into the picture. it is also pointed out that the initial singularity
problem is naturally resolved in this context.

1. introduction

in this paper we will elaborate on some ideas related to the possibility that our
observable four-dimensional world is a three-brane embedded in ten dimensional
string theory. there has been earlier speculations [1] stating that our observable
four-dimensional universe is a domain wall embedded in a higher dimensional space.
although there is no strong motivation for this idea, it has been revived recently [2]-
[11] motivated by the notion and existence of d-branes in string theory [12], and the
fact that orientifold [13] and d-manifold [14] vaccua of string theory can be thought
of as lower-dimensional d-branes embedded in a ten-dimensional bulk. an early ex-
ample of this is the horava-witten picture for the non-perturbative heterotic e8e8
string [15], the relevance of this for gauge coupling unication upon compactication
to ve dimensions [16] and the associated picture of supersymmetry breaking [17].

an extra motivation is the will of theorists to provide with potential new physics
signals the experimental physics community. here, in particular, the new physics
can be string eects, or quantum gravitational eects in scales that well below the
four-dimensional planck scale. one can avoid typical string theory constraints by
focusing on type i (orientifold) vaccua of string theory. although this approach has
not obviously solved any major theoretical problem yet it is an interesting alternative
and its implications should be pursued.

1

a xed hyperplane of an orientifold transformation can be thought of as a bound
state of an orientifold plane and a d-brane. the orientifold plane carries no degrees of
freedom localized on it, but only some cp-odd couplings to cancel similar couplings
of the bound d-brane. when moduli are varied, the d-brane(s) can move away
from orientifold planes. in open string vaccua extra d-branes can participate in the
structure of the vaccum.

in fact a similar interpretation can be given to ordinary orbifold vaccua of the
heterotic and type ii strings 1. the xed planes of the orbifold are bound states of
an orbifold plane and an ns-brane for a z2 twist. for a zn twist there are n  1
non-coincident ns5-branes. the degrees of freedom localized on the orbifold plane
are essentially composed of the twisted sector elds of the orbifold. turning on
twisted moduli expectation values corresponds to moving the ns5-branes away from
the orbifold plane.

thus a typical (orbifold) vaccum of type i theory can be thought of as a col-
lection of at (torroidal) intresecting d-branes in a ten-dimensional at bulk space.
constraints have to be satised, notably tadpole cancellation which ensures anoma-
lly cancellation and reects charge neutrality in a compact space. in the presence
of some unbroken spacetime supersymmetry, the conguration of d-branes is sta-
ble. stability is a non-trivial requirement in the case of broken supersymmetry. it
is however known that supersymmetric (bps) d-branes have velocity dependent in-
teractions [18]. thus there is non-trivial dynamics in the case that a d-brane is
disturbed in the context of a stable conguration.

in this context, the standard model gauge bosons as well as charged matter arise
as uctuations of the d-branes. we can thus consider the universe (standard model)
to be living on a collection of coincident branes, while hidden gauge interactions can
be localized on other branes and gravity as well as other universal interactions is
living in the bulk space.

there is an approximation which is very useful in order to treat the dynamics
of the universe brane. this is the probe limit in which the inuence of the probe
brane source to the bulk elds is negligible. this has been a natural and useful tool
[19]-[21] in order to understand issues in the context of ads/cft correspondence
[22].

there has been a lot of recent work on the potential cosmological models asso-
ciated to a brane universe [23]-[36]. our approach will be slightly dierent. we can
imagine the collection of other branes to provide a gravitational background which is
felt by the universe brane treated as a probe. in this context a universe three-brane
(or higher compactied brane) can be in motion in ten-dimensional space in the
presence of a the gravitational eld of the other branes. we ignore its back reaction
to the ambient geometry. we will show that the motion in ambient space induces

1this is implicit in [41].

cosmological expansion (or contraction) on our universe simulating various kinds of
matter or a cosmological constant (ination). this is what we mean by mirage
cosmology: the cosmological expansion is not due to energy density on our universe
but somewhere else. this can be either on other branes (that can be representated
qualitatively by a black hole background) or in the bulk.

there is a dierent limit in which our universe is moving to a region of ultra-
weak bulk elds, in which case the matter density on it alone drives the cosmological
expansion, in the traditional fashion.

the holographic principle and ads/cft correspondence ideas, are providing
novel ways to treat old mechanisms. in the case of cosmological expansion, super-
symmetry is very softly broken and it is expected that the probe approximation may
be valid even in the case where the source is not hierarchically heavier than the probe
[21]. it was observed that for a d-brane moving in the background of a black d-brane
the word-volume theory has an eective speed of light which is eld dependent [21].
once the probe brane is in geodesic motion the varying speed of light is equivalent
to cosological expansion on the probe brane.

there are two possibilities to be explored in relation with the bulk geometry. the
bulk may not be compact (but there is a mass gap [37] or some way it makes low
lying higher-dimensional gravitons unobservable [6]). then, there is no bound on the
mass of d-branes. if the bulk is compact there are charge neutrality constraints that
must be satised and they constraintthe brane congurations. in simple situations
they limit the number of d-branes. a typical example is the d9-branes in type-i
string theory whose number is limited to 32.

here we will mostly focus in the non-compact case without worrying about this.
in the case where the space is compact the generalization (and limitation) of our
arguments will be straightforward. for regions which are small compared to the
sixe of the compact space the description of geodesics is accurate. when a geodesic
reaches distances comparable with the compact size we must use the form of bulk
solution which is periodic (and can be constructed as an innite periodic array of
non-compact solutions). using such a matching formula the full geodesics can be
studied. this will imply that in such a context the most probable cosmological
evolution is a bouncing one.

thus the central idea is that the universe brane is moving into the bulk back-
ground elds of other branes of the theory. the motion of the brane follows thus, a
classical geodesic in the bulk geometry. the prototype branes we are using here are
dp-branes with maximal supersymmetry. any realistic type-i groundstate can be
viewed in big region of moduli space as intersecting such branes. moreover we know
well the coupling of world-volume elds to the bulk supergravity elds.

there are two steps in the procedure:

 determine the brane motion by solving the world-volume eld equations for

3

the scalar elds determining the position of the brane in the bulk

 determine the induced metric on the brane which now becomes an implicit
function of time. this gives a cosmological evolution in the induced brane
metric. this cosmological evolution can be reinterpreted in terms of cosmolog-
ical mirage energy densities on the brane via a friedman-like equation.

 similarly one can determine the other interactions on the brane
an important observation here is that the cosmological evolution is not driven
by four-dimensional gravity on the brane. our analysis casts doubts on inationary
models as those of reference [23] where the position scalar and its potential is used to
generate ination on the brane via conventional four-dimensional gravity couplings.
we have analysed various combinations of branes and simple background eld.
they correspond to a stack of dp-branes on and out of extremality (black dp-branes)
as well as with additional constant antisymmetric tensor backgrounds. they provide
a cosmological evolution on the probe brane that can be simulated by various types of
mirage matter on the brane. most prominent is radiation-types (w=1/3) or massless
scalars (w=1).
it should be stressed however that at small scale factor size, ther
are many exotic types of mirage matter inluding w values that are outside the range
|w|  1 required by four-dimensional causality. we interpret this as an indication
that superluminal (from that four-dimensional points of view) shocks are possible
in such cosmologies. superluminal signal propagation in a brane-world context have
been recently pursued independently in [36, 38].

another peculiarity is that individual densities of mirage dilute matter can be
negative (without spoiling the overall positivity at late times). we think that this is
linked to the fact that in this type of cosmology the initial singularity is an artifact
of the low energy description.

this can be seen by studying brane motion in simple spaces like ads5s5 which
are globally non-singular. the induced cosmological evolution of a brane moving in
such a space has a typical expansion prole due to radiation and an initial singularity
(from the four-dimensional point of view). however this singularity is an artifact.
at the point of the initial singularity the universe brane joins a ollection of parallel
similar branes and there is (non-abelian) symmetry enhancement. the eective eld
theory breaks down and this gives rise to the singularity.

the next obvious question is how real matter/energy densities on the brane
aect its geodesic motion and consequently the induced cosmological evolution. this
can be studied by turning on electromagnetic energy on the brane. we nd a solution
of the moving brane with a covariantly constant electric eld. we do show that this
gives an additional eect on the cosmological evolution similar to the analoguous
problem of radiation density in four-dimensions. this indicates that the formal-
ism we present is capable of handling the most general situation possible, namely

4

cosmological evolution driven by bulk backround elds (mirage matter) as well as
world-volume energy densities (real matter).

the structure of the paper is as follows. in section 2 we develop the formalism
for d-brane geodesics in non-trivial bulk metric as well as rr form. the induced
cosmological evolution is also derived.
in section 3 we study the inuence on the
geodesics of an additional constant ns antisymmetric tensor background. in section 4
we derive the geodesic equations in the presence of an electric eld background on the
probe brane. in section 5 we study the friedman-like equations for various examples
of bulk elds. in section 6 we discuss the nature and fate of the initial (cosmological)
singularity. finally section 7 contains our conclusions and open problems.

2. brane geodesics

in this section we will consider a probe d-brane moving in a generic static, spherically
symmetric background. the brane will move in a geodesic. we assume the brane to
be light compared to the background so that we will neglect the back-reaction. the
idea here is that as the brane moves in a geodesic, the induced world-volume metric
becomes a function of time, so that from the brane residents point of view they
are living in a changing (expanding or contracting) universe.

the simplest case corresponds to a d3-brane and we will focus mostly on this
case. later we will consider dp-branes with p > 3 and p3 coordinates compactied.
the metric of a d3-brane may be parametrized as

ds2

10 = g00(r)dt2 + g(r)(d~x)2 + grr(r)dr2 + gs(r)d5

(2.1)

and we may also generically have a dilaton (r) as well as a rr background c(r) =
c0...3(r) with a self-dual eld strength. the probe brane will in general start moving
in this background along a geodesic and its dynamics is governed by the dbi action.
in the case of maximal supersymmetry it is given by

s = t3z d4eqdet( g + (2)f  b) + t3z d4 c4 + anomaly terms

(2.2)
where we have ignored the world-volume fermions. the emmbeded data are given
by

g = g

x


x


etc. due to reparametrization invariance, there is a gauge freedom which may be
xed by choosing the static gauge, x =   = 0, 1, 2, 3. a generic motion of
the probe d3-brane will have a non-trivial angular momentum in the transverse
directions. in the static gauge the relevant (bosonic) part of the brane lagrangian
reads

l = qg(r)3[|g00|  grr r2  gs(r)hij i j]  c(r)

(2.3)

(2.4)

5

where hij()dij is the line element of the unit ve-sphere. for future purposes
(generality) we will parametrize the lagrangian as

l = qa(r)  b(r) r2  d(r)hij i j  c(r)

(2.5)

with

a(r) = g3(r)|g00(r)|e2

, b(r) = g3(r)grr(r)e2

, d(r) = g3(r)gs(r)e2

(2.6)
and c(r) is the rr background. the problem is eectively one-dimensional and can
be solved by quadratures.the momenta are given by

(2.7)

(2.8)

b(r) r

pr = 

pi == 

qa(r)  b(r) r2
qa(r)  b(r) r2  d(r)hij i j

d(r)hij j

the angular momenta as well as the hamiltonian

h = e = c 

a(r)

qa(r)  b(r) r2  d(r)hij i j

are conserved. the conserved total angular momentum (so(5) quadratic casimir in
our case) is hijpipj = 2 and

hij i j =

2(a(r)  b(r) r2)
d(r)(d(r) + 2)

thus, the nal equation for the radial variable is

s d
d + 2 (a(r)  b(r) r2) =

a(r)

e + c(r)

.

in summary,

r2 =

of r. a stronger condition can be obtained from (2.11)

(2.17)

so that the universe metric is ds2 = d2 +g(r())(d~x)2. this is the standard form of
a at expanding universe. we can now derive the analogues of the four-dimensional
friedman equations by dening the scale factor as a2 = g. then,

(2.23)

as we will see in specic examples later on, this approximation is usually valid for
motion far away from the source corresponding to large (late) time of the scale factor.
moreover, going back towards what is the initial singularity, relativistic corrections
become increasingly important.

the discussion above may easily be generalized for the geodesic motion of a
probe dp-brane in the eld of a dp-brane with p > p. in this case, the dp-brane
metric is of the form

ds2

10 = g00(r)dt2 + g(r)(d~xp)2 + grr(r)dr2 + gs(r)d8p ,

(2.24)

and there exist in general a non-trivial dilaton prole  = (r) as well as a rr p + 1
from cp+1. the dp-brane probe in this background will feel only gravitational and
dilaton forces since it has no p-brane charge. its motion will then determined by the
dbi action

(2.25)

(2.26)

sp = tpz dp+1eqdet( g)

in the static gauge and for a generic motion with non-trivial angular-momentum in
the transverse directions of the dp-brane we nd that the lagrangian turns out to
be

l = qap(r)  bp(r) r2  dp(r)hij i j

where now
ap(r) = gp(r)|g00(r)|e2

, bp(r) = gp(r)grr(r)e2

, dp(r) = gp(r)gs(r)e2 .
(2.27)

proceeding as before, we nd the induced metric on the dp-brane,

ds2 = (g00 + grr r2 + gshij i j)dt2 + g(d~xp)2

(2.28)

and upon substitution becomes

e2
we can dene now the cosmic time  as

ds2 =

dt2 + g(d~xp)2

d = |g00|gp/2e

(2.29)

(2.30)

so that the universe metric is ds2 = d2 + g(r())(d~x)2. the analogues of the
p+1-dimensional friedman equations are determined by dening the scale factor as
a2 = g. as before we obtain a friedman type equation with an eective density given
by

g!2
  g 

(2.31)

e =

e2gse2  |g00|(gsgp + 2e2)

4|g00|grrgsgp

note that in the case p = p, there exist the additional wz term tpr cp+1 in the
action(2.25) which modies the equations of motion of the probe brane as well as
the induced metric. this modication is nothing than the shift e  e + c where
c = c0...p.

3. branes with constant b-elds

interesting dynamics may also arise by turning on the antisymmetric ns/ns eld
b = 1
2 bdx  dx on the macroscopic dp-brane. in particular, a constant b will
not aect the background since it enters in the eld equations via its eld strength
h = db which is zero for a constant b. however, a probe brane feels not h but the
antisymmetric eld itself through the coupling

s = tpz dp+1eqdet( g  b) + tpz dp+1 cp+1 + anomaly terms

(3.1)

where

b = b

x


x
 .

(3.2)

we will assume again that there exist a macroscopic dp-brane with a background
metric as in eq.(2.24) and a probe dp-brane with p < p. in addition to the dilaton
(r) and rr form cp+1, the dp-brane now supports a constant ns/ns two-form
in its world-volume which we take to be is b = bdxp1  dxp.
in this case there
exists an induced antisymmetric two form on the probe dp-brane and its motion is
determined by the lagrangian

l = qkp(r)  lp(r) r2  np(r)hij i j

(3.3)

where now

kp(r) = g(r)p2(g(r)2 + b2)|g00(r)|e2
np(r) = g(r)p2(g(r)2 + b2)gs(r)e2 .

, lp(r) = g(r)p2(g(r)2 + b2)grr(r)e2 ,

first integrals of the equations of motion are now

while the induced metric will still be given by eq.(2.15). proceeding as before we
nd that the friedman-like equations are

4. electric fields on the brane

let us now assume that we turn on an electric eld on the probe d3-brane. in this
case, the action for the d3-brane is given in (2.2) and for the background in (2.1)
the lagrangian takes the form

l = qa  b r2  e 2g2  c

(4.1)

where e 2 = 2eiei and ei = tai(t) in the a0 = 0 gauge and a, b are given in
(2.6). for simplicity we focus on radial motion.

the equations of motions for the electric eld turn out to be

and we nd that

ei =

(4.3)

where i is an integration constant and 2 = (2)ii. in the case r = 0, ei is
constant as it is required by ordinary maxwell equations. a rst integral is given by

r2 =

b  1 

(c + e)2(1 + 2g2)! .

(4.4)

10

using (4.4), we obtain

e 2 = 2

a2

(c + e)2(g2 + 2)2 .

the induced metric on the probe d3-brane turns out to be

ds2 = 

g2
00g5e2

(c + e)2(2 + g2)

dt2 + g(d~x)2

(4.5)

(4.6)

and by dening the cosmic time  along similar lines we obtain the following analog
of the friedman equations

a(cid:19)2
(cid:18) a

=

(c + e)2(1 + 2g2)  |g00|g3e2)

4|g00|grrg3e2

  g 

(4.7)

we note that the dominant contribution to ( a/a)2 from the electric eld is of
order e 2 as can be seen from eq.(4.5) and thus proportional to the energy density
  e 2. it should also be noted that there exist a limiting value for the electric eld
[39],[40] which is

e 2  a2g2

(4.8)

the gauge invariance of the bulk antisymmetric tensor is closely tied with that
of the world-volume gauge elds. this is in agreement with the observation that,
comparing equations (3.9) (with  = 0) and (3.6) that an electric eld on the brane
or a constant antisymmetric tensor in bulk produce similar cosmological evolution.

5. cosmology of a probe d3-brane in various backgrounds

in this section we will analyse several concrete bulk congurations and elaborate on
the induced cosmological expansion on the universe brane.

brane is black we obtain the associated black hole solution with metric

when the brane is falling towards the black-brane the universe is contacting while
if it moving outwards, it is expanding. far from the black-brane ef f  a4.
in
this regime the brane motion produces a cosmological expansion indistinguishable
with the one due to (dilute) radiation on the brane. as one goes backward in time
there is a negative energy density  a6 controlled by the angular momentum . it
corresponds to e = pe, relation characteristic of a massless scalar. although the
density is negative the overall eective density remains non-negative for 0 < a < .
at earlier times the factor  a8 dominates corresponding to dilute matter with
p = w  and w = 5/3 > 1. such a behavior is unattainable by real matter on the
brane since causality implies that |w|  1. finally, at very early times the evolution
is dominated by mirage density with w = 7/3.

more generally we can consider the d3-brane moving in the background of a
p > 3 black brane. this problem has been considered in a previous section. in this
case we obtain an eective density using (2.31) with p=3:

as is obvious from the above, that the universe brane cannot go far away from the
black-brane.
it bounces back at some nite value of the scale factor. thus this
described a closed universe where the deceleration is provides by bulk elds rather
than curvature on the brane. particularly, interesting is the case p = 5 where (5.3)

the term a2 produces an eect similar to positive curvature and slows the expan-
sion. the terms a6 simulate the density of a massless scalar w = 1. this density
increases with e and r0 while the angular momentum tends to decrease the den-
sity. moreover there is also a component with w = 7/3 in the case  = r0 = 0, the
universe expands until it eventually stops and eventually recolapses. the general
picture with recolapse is also true for all p > 3. for p = 4 we obtain the eective
indices w = 7/9, 5/9, 11/9, 7/9, 19/9. for p = 6 we obtain w = 1, 5/3, 7/3, 3, 13/3.

for small a the dominant term in the evolution is a6. for later times the scale factor
will bounce depending on parameters before a = 1.

as a conclusion for the asymptotic geometries of spherically symmetric branes,
the evolution equation for the scale factor is dierent from standard evolution due
to some kind of density on the brane. on the other it will be expected that once
the universe brane is far away from the source and the gravitational and other elds
are weak, in this regime the dominant source of cosmological expansion will be the
matter density on the brane.

near horizon of a d3-brane with a constant b-eld

the near-horizon geometry of a d3-brane with a constant b-eld is still given
by eq.(5.1). by using eq.(3.9) for p = 3, we nd that the eective density on a probe
d3-brane in the d3-brane background with a constant b-eld turns out to be

it is not dicult to see that the eect of the electric eld aects the cosmological

thus, the extra electric eld adds at late times an extra eective density  = 2 =
e 2.

this is a behavior that is expected: extra matter density on the brane, aects
the geodesics (motion) , and this in turn aects the eective expansion of the brane
universe. moreover, this gives for small elds (or large scale factors) eects that are
similar to those of a constant bulk ns antisymmetric tensor. both produce an eect
that can be interpretated as radiation in our brane universe.

6. the resolution of the initial singularity

in four dimensions standard cosmological models always carry an initial singularity.
this is the point in the past of the evolution where the scale factor a(t) goes to zero
so that all space-like sections of space-time collapse to a point. this is a general
feature and powerful theorems have established the occurrence of the initial singu-
larity for matter obeying the energy-conditions [42]. since the latter are satised
for all known forms of matter, the initial singularity seems to be unavoidable. the
basic assumption in the above is that the full description is given in terms of four-
dimensional general relativity. if one views general relativity as an eective theory
of a more fundamental theory, then the presence of the initial singularity may be re-
solved in the fundamental theory. one could argue that the singularity appears not
because the fundamental solution is singular but because the eective eld theory
used to describe, is not valid in this regime [43, 44]. in particular, as discussed for
example in [44], due to t-duality an initial singularity could really correspond to a
decompactication limit for the relevant low energy (dual) modes.

in our context, there are cases where mirage energy violates the standard
energy conditions. for example for dilute matter we have p = w  with |w|  1 for
causality. in our the previous section we have found the mirage matter had |w| > 1
in most of the cases, (as well as some components of the density being negative)
leading to the possibility of singularity-free evolution.

this can be seen in the simple example of the geodesic motion of a probe d3-

brane in the near-horizon of macroscopic d5-branes with metric

ds2 =

r

l (cid:16)dt2 + d~x2

5(cid:17) +

l

r (cid:16)dr2 + r2d3(cid:17) .

(6.1)

14

in this case, solving for r(t) with  = 0 we get

r(t)4 = l4e cosh2(cid:18)2t
l(cid:19) .

the induced metric (2.15) turns out to be

ds = 

e1/4

cosh5/2(cid:16) 2t
l(cid:17)

dt2 +

e1/4

cosh1/2(cid:16) 2t

3 .

(6.2)

(6.3)

this four-dimensional metric has a singularity for t =  (initial singularity). how-
ever, the higher dimensional geometry is regular. what becomes singular is the
embedding of the brane in the bulk. alternatively speaking, the four-dimensional
singularity is smoothed out once the solution is lifted to higher dimensions. this is a
well known method for desingularizing four-dimensional manifolds and appears here
naturally.

similarly, we may consider the motion of a probe d3-brane in ads5  s5 back-
ground. indeed we expect that for motion in this smooth manifold no real singular-
ity on the brane can be encountered. here we nd from (2.12) and for  = 0 that
0  r4 <  for e > 0. the proper time  is then given

 =

1
2l

2r4 + l4 

l
2

,

(6.4)

dened such that  = 0 for r = 0 and thus 0   < . on the other hand, solving
for the scale factor a() we nd that

()4 =

8e

l2  ( + 0)2 

l2

16! ,

where 0 is an integration constant. at  = 0 we get that

(0)4 =

8e

l2  2
0 

l2

16! ,

(6.5)

(6.6)

so that we obtain the standard singularity for |0| > l/4. this is the point that the
brane reaches r = 0 which is a coordinate singularity and otherwise a regular point
of the ads5 space. again, the embedding becomes singular there.

from the string theory picture we do understand that the initial singularity here
corresponds to the probe brane coalescing with the other branes that generate the
bulk background. the eective eld theory on the brane is singular at this point
because one has to take into account the non-abelian modes (zero length strings)
that become massless. the interpretation of the real initial singularity here is as a
breakdown of the eective low energy eld theory description.

7. conclusions and further directions

we have pointed out that if our universe is a d-brane embedded in a higher dimen-
sional bulk, then motion of the brane in nontrivial bulk backgrounds with a certain
symmetry (spherical in our case) produces a homogeneous and isotropic cosmologi-
cal evolution on the universe brane. by considering various bulk background elds
we have derived friedman-like equations. these provide cosmological evolution that
can be attributed to matter density on the universe brane, although they are due
to motion in nontrivial bulk elds. from the universe brane perspective such en-
ergy context is a mirage. the only way to tell whether the energy density driving
the evolution of the universe is in the universe itself is by direct observation with
conventional means (light for example).

it is also important to point out that we consider a situation where the spacial
sections of the universe brane are at. unlike the typical four-dimensional case
though, the eects of non-trivial spacial curvature (a a2 term in the friedman
equation) can be simulated by the brane motion. we have seen in section 5 that a
d3-brane moving the eld of parallel d5-branes produces an eect similar to having
a negative constant curvature in the spatial slice.

we should also point out here that it is also possible to consider situations where
the induced brane metric really does have positive constant curvature. that should
be produced by a bulk b eld with h  . finding the precise solution in
iia,b supergravity is an interesting problem.

when we have extra world-volume elds excited on the brane, these aect the
universe brane motion, the induced metric and thus the cosmological evolution. we
have analysed the case of electromagnetic energy (electric elds) and shown that it
aects the cosmological evolution as normal radiation would. this indicates that the
present formalism is capable of describing the most general cosmological evolution
on a universe brane. this is driven by bulk elds (that we could label bulk energy)
as well as world-volume elds (brane-energy). the cosmological evolution in this
context has the simple and appealing interpretation of brane motion in the bulk.

generically the friedman-like equations we nd contain components that can be
interpreted as dilute matter with |w| > 1 that would otherwise clash with causality in
four-dimensions. this may be an indication that the bulk can support superluminal
signal propagation from the brane point of view. moreover sometimes, some eective
density coecients can be negative (without spoiling the positivity of the overall
eective density). this violates typical four-dimensional positive energy conditions.
a friedman type cosmological evolution is equivalent to a variable speed of light
in the context of non-dynamical gravity. cosmological implications of a variable
light speed have been recently discussed in [45]. our description here can be cast
in that language [21]. in [21] it was pointed out that a natural way of inducing a
eld-dependent light velocity of brane is in the presence of a (cosmological) black

16

brane. subsequent motion of the probe brane, either falling into the black brane, or
escaping outwards (a hawking radiated brane ?) would make the velocity of light
eld dependent and thus induce cosmological evolution.

the issue of the initial singularity has a natural resolution in this context. al-
though the universe brane has a singular geometry at zero scale factor, this is due
to a singular embeding in the otherwise regular bulk space. this resolution of sin-
gularities in higher dimensions is not new but occurs naturally here. relativistic
corrections are important when one approaches the initial singularity. they invali-
date for example naive treatments of brane elds when the universe brane approaches
other branes.

there are some interesting open problems in this line of thought.

 the rst concerns the possibility of inducing and ending ination as a con-
sequence of brane motion. this is similar in spirit with [23] but the context
is dierent: here ination is not generated by four-dimensional gravity on the
brane. this will provide for a natural source of ination since the inaton is
supplied automatically once we decide that our four-dimensional universe is a
soliton-like object in a higher-dimensional theory.

 a second direction is nding bulk congurations that induce a cosmological
evolution on the brane similar to that of dust (w=0). such mirage matter might
be a component of dark matter on our universe. it is conceivable that such
mirage matter could gravitate and trace the visible (world-volume) matter
as observation suggests.

 finding brane congurations with non-zero spacial curvature is also an inter-

esting problem.
