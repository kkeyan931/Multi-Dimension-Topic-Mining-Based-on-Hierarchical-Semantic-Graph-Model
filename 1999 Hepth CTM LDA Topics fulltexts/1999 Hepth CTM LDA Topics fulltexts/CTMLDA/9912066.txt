(4) (5) then, varying eq.(4) respect g gives expression eld f terms f = , (6) together eq.(4) turns back original siegel action eq.(3). shows classical equivalence actions eqs.(3) (4). third step vary eq.(4) respect f, yields expression g terms f g = f (g + ) f . similar eq.(5), g dened g = g g , which, eq.(7) substituted, gives relationship f g f = g. (7) (8) (9) necessary point advance eq.(9) generally satised four chiral boson actions discussed paper (cf. subsects. 3.1, 4.1 5.1) although relations f g actions dierent one another. eq.(9), easy invert eq.(7) obtain f terms g f = g + (g + ) g . (10) check eq.(7) self-duality condition satised, i.e., f = 0, called mass shell ref.{$9808049$}, f g relate anti-duality 6 g = f. note ref.{$9808049$} relate dual relation distinct metric notation. see type anti-duality also appears floreanini-jackiw pasti-sorokin-tonin actions d=2 case although eqs.(7), (27) (51) quite dierent one another (cf. subsects. 3.1 5.1), srivastava action (cf. subsect. 4.1). substituting eq.(10) eq.(4), get dual version siegel action sdual = z d2x(cid:20) 1 2 gg + 1 2 gg + g(cid:21) . variation eq.(11) respect gives g = 0, whose solution g() = f (), (11) (12) arbitrary scalar eld. eq.(12) substituted eq.(11), obtain dual action exactly siegel action eq.(3) replacement . analysed above, coincide constant self-duality condition imposed. therefore, siegel action self-dual respect (x) (x) anti-dualization expressed eqs.(6) (12). 2.2 d=6 case siegel action = 6 space-time dimensions takes form  = z d6x(cid:20) 1 6 f(a)f (a) + 1 2 f (a)f (a)(cid:21) , (13) f(a) 3-form eld strength real antisymmetric tensor eld a(, = 0, 1, , 5) f(a) = + + , f(a) dened f(a) = f(a) 1 3! f (a). (14) (15) order discuss duality siegel action, introduce two 3-form elds f g, replace eq.(13) following action = z d6x(cid:20) 1 6 ff + 1 2 f f + 1 3 g (cid:16)f (cid:17)(cid:21) , (16) 7 f g act, present, independent auxiliary elds. vary eq.(16) respect g gives f = , (17) which, substituted eq.(16), yields equivalence actions eqs.(13) (16). hand, variation eq.(16) respect f leads expression g terms f g = f  1 3! . like eq.(15), dene g g = g 1 3! g , obtain, eq.(18) substituted eq.(19), relation f = g. (18) (19) (20) note generally satised four actions = 6 case although relations f g actions quite dierent one another (cf. subsects. 3.2, 4.2, 5.2). eq.(20), invert eq.(18) quite easily solve f terms g f = g +  + 1 3! . (21) verify eq.(18) self-duality condition satised, i.e., f = 0, f g relate anti-duality g = 1 3! f. relation also appears floreanini-jackiw pasti-sorokin-tonin actions = 6 case, srivastava action. substituting eq.(21) action eq.(16), obtain dual siegel action = 6 case sdual = z d6x(cid:20) 1 6 gg + 1 2 g g + ag(cid:21) . variation eq.(22) respect gives g = 0, 8 (22) (23) whose solution g(b) = 1 3!  1 3! f(b), (24) b arbitrary 2-form eld. eq.(24) substituted dual action eq.(22), get result dual action siegel action eq.(13) replacement b . consequently, siegel action self-dual = 6 dimensional space-time respect b anti-dualization given eqs.(17) (24). 3 self-duality floreanini-jackiw action 3.1 d=2 case floreanini-jackiw action = 2 dimensions form  = z d2xh01 (1)2i , (25) auxiliary elds introduced. non-manifestly lorentz covariant action, poincare invariance point view hamiltonian analyses. subsect. 2.1, introduce two independent auxiliary vector elds f g, replace eq.(25) action = z d2xhf0f1 (f1)2 + g(f )i . (26) variation action respect lagrange multiplier g gives rise result eq.(6), leads equivalence eqs.(25) (26). hand, variation eq.(26) respect f gives expression g terms f whose inversion g0 = f1, g1 = f0 + 2f1, f0 = 2g0 g1, f1 = g0. 9 (27) (28) dene f g eqs.(5) (8), respectively, discover still satisfy relation eq.(9) pointed subsect. 2.1. moreover, f g anti-dual relation g = f self-duality condition = 2 case f = 0 imposed eq.(27). substituting eq.(28) eq.(26), obtain dual floreanini-jackiw action sdual = z d2xh(g0)2 + g0g1 + gi . (29) remaining procedure subsect. 2.1. result, floreanini- jackiw action = 2 dimensional space-time self-dual respect (x) (x) anti-duality shown eqs.(6) (12). 3.2 d=6 case non-manifestly lorentz covariant formulation floreanini jackiw general- ized chiral p-forms ref.. action chiral 2-form = 6 dimensions = z d6x(cid:20) 1 2 (cid:18)f0ij(a) 1 3! 0ijklmf klm(a)(cid:19) 1 3! 0ijnpqf npq(a)(cid:21) , (30) f(a) eld strength , stated eq.(14), latin letters stand spatial indices (i, j, = 1, , 5). note auxiliary elds appear eq.(30). following, utilize simplier form eq.(30) = z d6x(cid:20) 1 12 0ijklmf0ij(a)fklm(a) 1 6 fklm(a)fklm(a)(cid:21) . (31) begin duality property action eq.(31) dualization antisymmetric tensor eld . introducing two auxiliary 3-forms f g, construct new action replace eq.(31) = z d6x(cid:20) 1 12 0ijklmf0ij fklm 1 6 fklmfklm + 1 6 g(f )(cid:21) , (32) f g treated independent elds. sake convenience calculation, rewrite eq.(32) = z d6x(cid:20) 1 12 0ijklmf0ij fklm 1 6 1 2 g0ij(f0ij ) gklm(fklm )(cid:21) . fklmfklm + + 1 6 10 (33) variation eq.(33) respect lagrange multiplier g gives eq.(17), shows equivalence eqs.(31) (33). moreover, variation eq.(33) respect f gives expression g terms f g0ij = gklm = 1 6 1 2 0ijnpqfnpq, 0npklmf0np 2f klm, f calculated f 0ij = 2g0ij + 1 6 0ijnpqgnpq, f klm = 1 2 0npklmg0np. (34) (35) dene f g eqs.(15) (19), respectively, nd still satisfy eq.(20) although eqs.(18) (34), i.e., relations f g siegel floreanini-jackiw formulations chiral 2-forms, quite dierent. addition, imposing self-duality condition = 6 case, i.e., f = 0, eq.(34), still derive anti-duality f g, g = 1 3! f. substituting eq.(35) eq.(33), obtain dual formulation floreanini-jackiw chiral 2-form = 6 case sdual = z d6x(cid:20) 1 2 g0ij g0ij + 1 12 0ijklmg0ij gklm + 1 2 ag(cid:21) . (36) following steps straightforward. variation eq.(36) respect gives g = 0, whose solution eq.(24) antisymmetric tensor eld b introduced. eq.(24), dual action eq.(36) action eq.(31), replacement b . therefore, verify floreanini-jackiw action chiral 2-form = 6 dimensions self-dual b anti- duality transform eqs.(17) (24). 4 self-duality srivastava action 11 4.1 d=2 case write linear formulation chiral bosons suggested srivastava  = z d2x(cid:20) 1 2 + ( )(cid:21) , (37) scalar eld auxiliary vector eld. action defects pointed others , synthesizes manifest lorentz covariance self-duality constraint. let us introduce two auxiliary vector elds f g, construct new action replace eq.(37) = z d2x(cid:20) 1 2 f f + (f f) + g(f )(cid:21) , (38) f g independent elds. varying eq.(38) respect g, f = , i.e., eq.(6), prove new action eq.(38) equivalent original one eq.(37). hand, varying eq.(38) respect f, get g terms f g = f ( + ), or, vice versa, f terms g f = g ( + ). (39) (40) f g dened eqs.(5) (8), respectively, satisfy relation eq.(9) although eq.(39) quite dierent eq.(7) eq.(27). however, f g longer relate anti-duality self-duality condition f = 0 imposed eq.(39). happens self-duality condition lagrange multiplier introduced linearly action eq.(37). may say anti-duality f g necessary one considers duality property actions self-duality condition directly imposed actions. substituting eq.(40) eq.(38), obtain dual version srivastava action sdual = z d2x(cid:20) 1 2 gg (g g ) + g(cid:21) . (41) 12 varying eq.(41) respect , get g = 0 solve g() = f (), (42) arbitrary scalar eld. eq.(42) substituted eq.(41), nd dual action original one eq.(37) replacement . consequently, srivastava action = 2 case self-dual generalized dualization eq.(42). word generalized means (x) coincide (x) even self-duality condition considered. 4.2 d=6 case easily generalize = 2 srivastava action = 6 case = z d6x(cid:20) 1 6 f(a)f (a) + 1 3 f (a)(cid:21) , (43) f(a) f (a) dened eqs.(14) (15), respectively, auxiliary antisymmetric tensor eld. variation action respect gives self-duality condition f (a) = 0 fact equation motion . therefore, eq.(43) indeed describes chiral 2-form eld = 6 dimensional space-time. canonical hamiltonian analysis, achieved straightforwardly following procedure shown ref.. omit it. introduce two auxiliary 3-form elds f g, construct new action replace eq.(43) = z d6x(cid:20) 1 6 ff + 1 3 f + 1 3 g(f )(cid:21) , (44) f g treated independent elds, f f 1 3! f. varying eq.(44) respect g, get f =  verify equivalence eqs.(43) (44). hand, varying eq.(44) respect f, expression g terms f g = f ( + 1 3! ), (45) 13 or, vice versa, f terms g f = g ( + 1 3! ). (46) usual, dene g = g 1 3! g obtain, using eq.(45), f = g. relation generally correct four formulations chiral 2-forms although eqs.(18), (34), (45) (56) quite dierent one another. but, similar = 2 case, f g relate anti-duality srivastava action even self-duality condition f = 0 imposed eq.(45). reason remains linearity self-duality condition action eq.(43). situation occur siegel, floreanini-jackiw pasti-sorokin-tonin actions. substituting eq.(46) eq.(44), get dual action sdual = z d6x(cid:20) 1 6 gg 1 3 g + ag(cid:21) .
