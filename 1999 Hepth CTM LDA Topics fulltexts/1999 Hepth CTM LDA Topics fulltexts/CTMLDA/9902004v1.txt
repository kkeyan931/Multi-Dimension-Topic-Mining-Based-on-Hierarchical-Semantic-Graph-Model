abstract

it is known that the noncommutativity of d-brane coordinate is responsible for describing
the higher-dimensional d-branes in terms of more fundamental ones such as d-particles
or d-instantons, while considering a noncommutative torus as a target space is conjec-
tured to be equivalent to introducing the background antisymmetric tensor eld in matrix
models. in the present paper we clarify the dual nature of both descriptions. namely the
noncommutativity of conjugate momenta of the d-brane coordinates realizes the target
space structure, whereas noncommutativity of the coordinates themselves realizes world
volume structure. we explicitly construct a boundary state for the dirichlet boundary
condition where the string boundary is adhered to the d-brane on the noncommutative
torus. there are non-trivial relations between the parameters appeared in the algebra of
the coordinates and that of the momenta.

1 introduction

recent developments in nonperturbative string theory have revealed various kinds of non-
commutative nature. one of such noncommutativity is that the space-time coordinates
of n d-branes are promoted to non-commuting n  n matrices [1]. in particular, this
description of coordinates of d-particles exhibits the noncommutative nature at the sub-
string scale [2] where conventional descriptions of space-time by the dierential geometry
cease to make sense. these facts suggest that noncommutative geometry (ncg) may play
an important role as a mathematical tool in the nonperturbative formulation of string the-
ory. the central idea of ncg is, using the equivalence of a manifold and the c -algebra
of functions dened on it, to reformulate the geometry of manifold in terms of the com-
mutative c -algebra and then to generalize the results to the case of a noncommutative
algebra. thus in the spirit of ncg, the world volumes of d-branes should realize ncg
because the coordinate functions on the world volumes of d-branes are non-commuting
matrices. in fact, the size n of the non-commuting matrices originates not from the target
space structure, but from the number of the world volumes of d-branes. henceforth we
will refer to this noncommutative nature associated to the world volumes of d-branes as
world volume noncommutativity which is characterized by the noncommutativity of the
matrices of the embedding coordinates of d-branes. especially for the classical solutions
describing d-brane with dimensions higher than the original one, say d-instanton, we need
to set the following non-trivial commutation relations for the d-instanton coordinates

[qi, qj] = if ij,

(1.1)

whereas the commuting case corresponds merely to multiple d-instantons conguration.
another kind of noncommutative nature in string theory has emerged in the context
of the toroidal compactication of matrix theory [3]. it is well known that matrix theory
compactied on a torus is obtained as supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) theory on the
dual torus [4]. however, if we consider the compactication on a torus t d for d  2,
we have an additional moduli arising from the 3-form tensor eld in the low energy 11-
dimensional supergravity. in fact, it was proposed that matrix theory compactied on
a torus with this constant background 3-form eld is described by sym theory on the
dual noncommutative torus [5]. moreover, it is shown that when compactied on t 2
with a constant neveu-schwarz 2-form eld bij, d-brane world volume theory is also
naturally described by gauge theory on the noncommutative torus and that -parameter
which characterizes the noncommutativity of the torus should be identied with bij [6].
evidences and generalizations of these proposals have been studied in many papers [7]-
[25]. in the following, we will call such noncommutative nature characterized by   bij
target space noncommutativity because it originates from the noncommutativity of the
target space torus on which the d-brane world volume is compactied.

since both noncommutative natures have been revealed as nonperturbative aspects of
string theory, it should be important from the point of view of nonperturbative formu-
lation of string theory to analyze them, in particular, to clarify their relationship. this
is the problem we address in this paper. we will show that they are in some sense dual
to each other and obey a certain simple relation by considering a boundary state which
describes a conguration of d-instantons on the (non)commutative two-torus. we will

1

only consider the bosonic string in order to make our argument as simple as possible, but
the generalization to the supersymmetric case is straightforward. in our analysis, one can
study how moduli of a d-string made of d-instantons are encoded in the noncommuta-
tivities in the original d-instanton conguration. from the point of view of d-instantons
as the fundamental degrees of freedom like [28, 29, 30, 31], it is important to interpret
the various moduli of the higher branes made of d-instantons and symmetries between
them as degrees of freedom present in the d-instanton conguration, partly done in [32].
thus our results will serve as a key ingredient to seek the constructive denition of string
theory by regarding d-instantons as the constituent.

the organization of this paper is as follows. in section 2, we present a prescription
for the compactication on the noncommutative torus t 2
 . in section 3, we construct a
boundary state corresponding to d-instantons on t 2
 and show that in this realization the
momentum operators of the d-instantons have noncommutative nature characterized
by . thus we manifest that the world volume noncommutativity and the target space
noncommutativity are dual to each other. in section 4, a conguration of d-instantons
whose coordinates are given by non-commuting matrices is studied on t 2 with the constant
bij ux. following the boundary state analysis done in [32], it is found that the world
volume and the target space noncommutativity are related through a simple equation
which is nothing but the consistency condition for a twisted bundle on t 2
 . implications
of this result are also given. section 5 is devoted to the discussions.

2 compactication on noncommutative two-torus

in this section, following the prescriptions given in [3, 4, 8], we present a formulation of
the compactication on a noncommutative two-torus.

we begin by recalling the usual compactication on t 2:

x i  r2/22, 2  z2,

pi  (2)

 exp ipi(x i + 2li) = exp ipix i

for li  2.

(2.1)

generalizing this, we dene the compactication on the noncommutative two-torus t 2

as follows. first we introduce the projective representation of z2 which is labeled by an
element  of the group h 2(z2, u(1)) = u(1) of equivalence classes of 2-cocycles dened
up to the coboundary of 1-cocycles:

u1u2 = e2iu2u1.

(2.2)

then the compactied theory is obtained by restricting to the subspace of the coordinates
xs which are invariant under the z2

 action:

i x jui = x j + 2sj
u 1
i ,

i, j = 1, 2.

(2.3)

this condition is known as the quotient condition. thus (2.3) means that

x i  r2/z2
,

2

where z2
the algebra of functions a(t 2

 ) on a noncommutative torus t 2
 .

 denotes the projective representation (2.2). note that (2.2) happens to dene

in [18], a concrete representation for each  is given by introducing a quantum plane

coordinate

then operators dened as

[i, j] = 2iij.

ui = eii,

(2.4)

(2.5)

generate the algebra a(t 2

) which is (one of) the dual algebra to a(t 2

 ) (see below):

using i and their partial derivative operators satisfying

u1 u2 = e2i u2 u1.

(2.6)

[i, j] = ij,

[i, j] = 0,

ui and x i can be expressed as

ui = eiie2ij j ,
x i = qi + ai( ui),
qi = 2isdi, d1 = 1, d2 = 2  if 1,

(2.7)

where ai is an arbitrary function of ui. for later convenience, we have taken a represen-
tation in such a way that qis are noncommutative:

[q1, q2] = ik,

k  (2s)2f.

(2.8)

in d-brane matrix models qi correspond to a classical solution to the equation of motion
for x i and ai correspond to a uctuation around qi.

then the dual lattice corresponding to t 2

 is given as the algebra of all operators
that commute with ui [5]. in [14, 18], this algebra is represented as that of the sections
on the twisted bundle of the adjoint representation of u(n) on t 2
 in the following way.
first, introduce n  n matrices u, v satisfying

uv = e2im/nv u,

(2.9)

where m is an integer. without loss of generality, we assume that n and m are relatively
prime. taking an appropriate basis, such matrices are represented as

ukl = exp(2ikm/n)kl,

vkl = k+1,l.

(2.10)

then the sections on adjoint bundles are generated by operator-valued matrices expressed
as

z1 = exp(cid:18)i

1

n  m(cid:19) v b,

z2 = exp(cid:18)i

2

n (cid:19) u b,

(2.11)

3

where b is an integer satisfying an  bm = 1 for some integer a. they indeed commute
with the uis and are also generators of the algebra of functions on a new noncommutative
torus z2

 where

 =

a() + b
m() + n

.

(2.12)

under this representation, the momentum lattice corresponding to (2.3) is nothing other
than z2

, an operator zi dened by eizi = zi satises

. in fact, for any element zi  z2

exp itr(u 1

i x juizj) = exp itr(u 1

i x jzjui) = exp itr(x jzj),

(2.13)

in the analogy of (2.1). here tr denotes the composition of the trace tr over nn matrices
and the integration over i [14]:

tr(f (z1, z2)) = z d1d2trf (z1, z2).

(2.14)

as shown in [4, 14, 18], in the context of matrix theory unitary operators ui and
scalar elds x i are represented as operators (2.7) for k 6= 0 acting on the twisted u(n)
fundamental bundle on the (non)commutative torus,

(1 + 2, 2) = 1(1, 2)(1, 2),
(1, 2 + 2) = 2(1, 2)(1, 2),

where i are transition functions

1(1, 2) = ei2u, 2(1, 2) = v,

(2.15)

(2.16)

with u, v given in (2.10) and  being a certain number determined below. they satisfy
the consistency condition

1(1, 2 + 2)2(1, 2) = 2(1 + 2, 2)1(1, 2).

(2.17)

on the other hand, covariant derivatives which appear in (2.7) satisfy the twisted bound-
ary conditions

di(1 + 2, 2) = 1(1, 2)di(1, 2)1(1, 2)1,
di(1, 2 + 2) = 2(1, 2)di(1, 2)2(1, 2)1.

combined with (2.17), this leads to the remarkable relation

1
2f

+  =

n
m

.

(2.18)

(2.19)

this equation means that the magnetic ux, the noncommutativity of the base space
torus, the rank of the gauge group and the number of the twist must be related with
each other from the requirement of the gauge theory on the noncommutative torus, since
[d1, d2] = if and  = m/n.

3 d-instantons on t 2 and t 2


in this section, we consider a boundary state together with operators acting on it corre-
sponding to a conguration of d-instantons on t 2 and t 2
 in the bosonic string theory.
then one can show that the target space noncommutativity is reected by that of the mo-
mentum operators and hence noncommutative structures in the d-instanton world volume
and the target space are dual to each other. in order to clarify the role of the noncom-
mutativities, we proceed step by step starting from the commutative case ( = 0, k = 0).

 = 0, k = 0

let us begin with dening a boundary state corresponding to d-instantons on com-

mutative torus t 2. we propose that it takes the following form:

|) = xwiz

eiiwi

|x i = 2swii1,

i  r/2z,

i = 1, 2

(3.1)

where |x i = 2swii1 denotes the dirichlet boundary state dened as

|x i = 2swii1 = e2ispiwi

|x i = 0i1.

here we dene |x i = 0i1 to be the coherent state satisfying

x i(s)|x i = 0i1 = 0,

(3.2)

(3.3)

and pi is the center of mass momentum of the string. since (3.2) labeled by wi  z are
all physically equivalent in the torus compactication, it is natural to consider the state
|) given by a superposition of these states as in (3.1). then it is easy to show that on
|) the center of mass coordinate of the string xi (conjugate to pi) becomes

and, therefore, the coordinate operator of d-instantons qi is represented as

xi|) = 2isi|),

on the other hand, on |), pj satises

qi = 2isi.

(cid:18)pj 

j

2s(cid:19) |) = 0,

since by denition,

e2ispj |x i = 2iswii1 = |x i = 2s(wi  j

i )i1,

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

since boundary state is a interaction vertex between string and d-brane, (3.4) and (3.6) are analogues
of the relations x1(x1  x2) = x2(x1  x2) and i(1 + 2)(x1  x2) = 0 satised by the local vertex
(x1  x2) for the point particles.

5

and hence

eiiwi

e2ispj |) = xwi
= xwi
= eij |) = uj|).

eii(wi+j

|x i = 2s(wi  j

i )i1

i )|x i = 2swii1

(3.8)

from (3.6), we can identify the momentum j carried by the d-instanton conguration
as

j = 

,

(3.9)

j
2s

because (3.6) represents the total momentum conservation. note that they indeed satisfy
the heisenberg algebra [qi, j] = ii
j.

comparing (3.5) and (3.9) with (2.5) and (2.7), we see that |) naturally realizes the

representation corresponding to d-instantons on t 2 with f = 0.

from (3.1)  is a dual coordinate to the winding number. this is consistent with
usual arguments in matrix theory where matrices have extra indices corresponding to the
multiple cover of s1 and the following quotient relation is put:

x i

m,n = x i

m1,n1 + 2rimn.

(3.10)

then the fourier transformation with respect to the extra indices leads to dual coordinate
 which gives the base space of the sym description.

 6= 0, k = 0

now let us turn to the string theory around d-instantons on the noncommutative
torus, namely,  6= 0. in this case, it is natural to dene a state |) of the form (3.1)
with  given by (2.4). note that |) dened as such is not the eigenstate of the abstract
operator . it is easy to nd that on |) xi is again given as

with qi given as (3.5), however, (3.6) is modied as

xi|) = qi|),

(pj 


4 jkxk 

j
2s

)|) = 0.

(3.11)

(3.12)

in order to identify j, we propose that it should satisfy heisenberg algebra with qi being
(3.5) and commute with ui according to the formulation developed in section 2. then
we nd that j is again expressed as (3.9). from (3.12), we obtain the total momentum
conservation in the following form:

(pj 


4 jkxk + j)|) = 0.

(3.13)

note that the center of mass momentum of the string seems to become pj  
4 jkxk
in (3.13). this form is an analogue of the momentum of a charged particle moving in a

6

magnetic eld. in the next section, by considering a conguration of d-instantons on t 2
with a constant 2-form eld ux bij, we will nd it quite natural to make the identication
 = b12. moreover, using (3.11), this equation can be rewritten as

(pj 


4 jkqk + j)|) = 0.

(3.14)

it states that in the case of  6= 0 the momentum operator j has an extent introduced
by the second term in (3.14) in the momentum space due to the target space noncommu-
tativity and that as a consequence the center of mass momentum of the string pi satises
the total momentum conservation in a modied form as above. it would be interesting
to examine relation between this extension in the momentum space and the target space
noncommutativity. in any case, the representation on |) with  given by (2.4) turns out
to correspond to a conguration of d-instantons on t 2
 , since qi is represented as (2.7) and
j is on the dual lattice. remarkably, on |), the momentum operators of d-instantons
do not commute with each other reecting the noncommutativity of the target space
torus:

.

(3.15)

1

[1, 2] =

(2s)2 [1, 2] =

i

22
s

moreover, for any operator w which depends on i and i, one can dene corresponding
matrix elements wminj as
w eijnj

wminj |x i = 2snji1.

eiimi

(3.16)

w |) = xnj

|x i = 2snji1 = xmi,nj

then if one imposes the quotient condition (2.3) on x i = qi + ai( ui) with qi being the
coordinate operator of d-instantons given in (3.5), it can be rewritten as the conditions
on matrix elements like

nlmk + 2sijnlmk ,
nlmk.
since qi is a diagonal matrix in this representation, these lead to

= qj
= eiik(mknk)aj

qj
nl+il mk+ik
aj

nl+il mk+ik

x j

nl+il mk+ik

= eiik(mknk)(x j

nlmk + 2sijnlmk).

(3.17)

(3.18)

under the identication  = b12 which we made above, this is nothing other than the
relation proposed in [12]. this conrms that in the present case it is natural to choose the
representation on |). thus we conclude that on t 2
 d-instanton momentum operators
have the noncommutative structure as in (3.15), and this is also the case on t 2 with the
constant 2-form eld ux.

as emphasized in the introduction, the world volume noncommutativity of d-instantons
is characterized by that of the space-time coordinates of these d-instantons, while as
shown in this section, the target space noncommutativity causes that of the momentum
operators of d-instantons. in this sense we can say that they are dual to each other.

for later convenience, it is useful to see that for  6= 0, due to the ordering ambiguity,

it is possible that |) takes a slightly dierent form from (3.1)

|) = xwiz

ei2w2

ei1w1

|x i = 2swii1,

(3.19)

7

with  given by (2.4). qi is expressed as (3.5) on this state, while (3.13) turns into

(p1 


2 x2 + 1)|) = 0,

(p2 + 2)|) = 0,

(3.20)

where i is the same as (3.9). the modied form (3.19) is formally obtained from (3.1) by
multiplying a factor exp(i 
4 x1x2), which may be interpreted as a gauge transformation
for the 2-form gauge potential under the identication of  = b12.

 = 0, k 6= 0

next let us discuss the case of k 6= 0. we rst consider such a conguration on the
commutative torus t 2. we propose that a boundary state corresponding to it is given as

|1, 2) = xwiz

eiiwi

|2s(w1, w2  f 1)i,

(3.21)

where f = k/(2s)2, and

|2s(w1, w2  f 1)i  |(x 1, x 2) = 2s(w1, w2  f 1)i.

(3.22)

in fact, it is easy to nd that

(x1 + (2s)2f p2)|1, 2) = 2is1|1, 2),

x2|1, 2) = 2is(2  if 1)|1, 2),

(3.23)

from which we read the coordinates of d-instantons qi as

q1 = 2is1,

q2 = 2is(2  if 1).

(3.24)

these imply that |1, 2) exactly provides the representation given in (2.7). note that in
(3.23) x1 does not quite coincide with q1. we regard it as a signal that for k 6= 0 each
d-instanton is spreading in size  k and that strings are attached to such an extended
object. in order to put a more physical interpretation on what happens, we analyze this
conguration by means of another method in the next section. also note that

and, therefore, we obtain

e2ispi

|1, 2) = eii|i, 2),

i = 

i
2s

.

(3.25)

(3.26)

this is again consistent with the formulation in section 2. moreover, one can generalize
(3.21) to include a index r = 1,    , n corresponding to the chan-paton index in the open
string sector in the following way:

|1, 2)r = xwiz

ei1w1+i(2+2r)w2/n|2s(w1, w2/n  f 1)i,

(3.27)

it may also suggest that for k 6= 0 a combination x1  kp2 plays a role of a new string coordinate
in which the center of mass coordinates of the string itself become noncommutative. a similar result
is also obtained in [13, 24] by considering the quantization of open strings ending on d-branes. the
noncommutativity of string coordinates already appeared in earlier works [26, 27].

8

which coincides with (3.21) for n = 1. like (3.21), |1, 2)r satises

(x1 + (2s)2f p2)|1, 2)r = 2is1|1, 2)r,

x2|1, 2)r = 2is(2  if 1)|1, 2)r,

e2ispi

|1, 2)r = eii|i, 2)r.

(3.28)

thus on |1, 2)r the coordinates of d-instantons qi are represented as n  n matrices

q1 = 2is1i,

q2 = 2is(2  if 1)i,

and i are represented as

i = 

i
2s

i,

(3.29)

(3.30)

as expected. recalling that as commented in section 2, representations like (3.29) are
given on the twisted u(n) fundamental bundle on t 2 in the context of matrix theory,
we expect that the state (3.27) in string theory has structure similar to the twisted u(n)
fundamental bundle. in fact, (3.27) satises the same twisted boundary condition as in
(2.15),

|1 + 2, 2)r = eim/n2urs|1, 2)s,
|1, 2 + 2)r = vrs|1, 2)s,

provided that

1
2f

=

n
m

,

(3.31)

(3.32)

which is just the equation obtained by setting  = 0 in (2.19). later we will discuss this
point including the case of  6= 0.

 6= 0, k 6= 0

finally let us discuss the case of  6= 0, k 6= 0. using the quantum plane coordinate
(2.4), a boundary state corresponding to a conguration with  6= 0, k 6= 0 including the
index r = 1,    , n is given as

|1, 2)r = xwiz

ei(2+2r)w2/ne1w1

|2s(w1, (1 + 2f )w2/n  f 1)i.

(3.33)

note that this state reproduces (3.27) for  = 0. little examination shows that this state
satises the following equations:

(x1 + (2s)2f p2)|1, 2)r = 2is1|1, 2)r,

x2|1, 2)r = 2is(2  if 1)|1, 2)r,

2 x2)|1, 2)r = ei(1+2f )1|1, 2)r,

e2is(p1 
ei(1+2f )2sp2|1, 2)r = ei2|1, 2)r.

from (3.34) and (3.35), on |1, 2)r the coordinates of d-instantons are given as

q1 = 2is1i,
q2 = 2is(2  if 1)i.

9

(3.34)
(3.35)

(3.36)
(3.37)

(3.38)
(3.39)

next let us identify the momenta i carried by the d-instanton conguration. as for 2,
combining (3.37) with the total momentum conservation

we obtain

(p2 + 2)|1, 2)r = 0,

2 = 

2

(1 + 2f )2s

i.

(3.40)

(3.41)

in fact, we see that (3.41) is consistent with both heisenberg algebra and formulation
in section 2 because q2 is represented as in (3.39), and (3.41) commutes with ui. as for
1, however, if we require that 1 should satisfy the heisenberg algebra with q1 given by
(3.38) and commute with ui, it must be given as
1
2s

1 = 

i.

(3.42)

compared with (3.36), this equation implies that the total momentum conservation in
the 1-direction is modied in the following form:

or

 p1 



2 x2 + (1 + 2f )1! |1, 2)r = 0,

 p1 



2 q2 + (1 + 2f )1! |1, 2)r = 0.

(3.43)

(3.44)

these equations admit of the same interpretation as in (3.13) and (3.14). note that (3.43)
agrees with the rst equation in (3.20) for f = 0. thus we have veried that |1, 2)r
indeed corresponds to the conguration in the case of  6= 0, k 6= 0.

as emphasized in (3.31), whether  = 0 or not, our state |1, 2)r in the case of k 6= 0

satises the same twisted boundary condition as in (2.15),

|1 + 2, 2)r = eim/n2urs|1, 2)s,
|1, 2 + 2)r = vrs|1, 2)s,

provided that

1
2f

+  =

n
m

,

(3.45)

(3.46)

which is just the equation obtained in (2.19). a similar equation is also obtained in [5].
it is worth noticing that a boundary state which corresponds to the twisted fundamental
bundle on the (non)commutative torus can be constructed in the context of string theory,
and that it reproduces the same condition as that required from a consistency of the
twisted bundle. although at present this correspondence is formal, it is expected that
string theory around a d-instanton conguration with  6= 0, k 6= 0 has certain structure
described by the (fundamental, or possibly adjoint) twisted bundle on the noncommutative
torus. for example, if (3.46) is satised, it is easy to show that

we see that operators zi dened in (2.11) naturally appear in the right-hand sides of both
equations. it may suggest that the statement mentioned above is indeed the case. among
others, it would be important to give a physical meaning to (3.46) in the context of string
theory. for this purpose, in the next section we consider a boundary state corresponding
to a conguration of d-instantons on t 2 with a constant bij ux and show that the
relation (3.46) is automatically satised with suitable identications.

4 d-instantons on t 2 with the 2-form field flux

in this section, we consider a conguration of d-instantons on t 2 of size 2s with the
constant 2-form eld bij ux. according to the boundary state analysis made in [32],
a conguration of d-instantons whose space-time coordinates are noncommutative can
be regarded as that of a single d-string. we closely follow this approach and clarify the
relationship between the noncommutativity of the world volume and the bij ux.

a conguration of d-instantons on t 2 we would like to consider is given by

[q1, q2] = ik 6= 0,

(4.1)

where qi are n  n matrices corresponding to the space-time coordinates of d-instantons,
entries of which are in general noncommutative operators. in compactied matrix theory,
such matrices are explicitly constructed for nite n [4]. note that the representation (2.7)
of qi given in section 2 shows that k is in proportion to the magnetic ux f as

k = (2s)2f,

[d1, d2] = if.

(4.2)

as stated in the introduction, k characterizes the noncommutative structure of the world
volume of d-instantons.

the boundary state for the conguration (4.1) is

|bi1 = trp exp(cid:18)iz 2

0

dspi(s)qi(cid:19) |x i = 0i1,

(4.3)

where pi(s) is the canonical momentum of the string in the presence of the background
2-form

pi(s) =

1
2 (gij x j  bijx j).

(4.4)

then similarly to [32], this boundary state can be expressed as the path integral

representation

|bi1 = z [dq1dq2] exp(cid:18) i

k z 2

dsq1(s)sq2(s)  iz 2

where gij is the metric of the t 2 and ni, wj are momentum number and winding number
operator, respectively. on the other hand, the boundary state |bi1 corresponding to a
conguration of a d-string on t 2 of the metric g
ij satises
the following equation:

(4.9)

comparing (4.8) with (4.9) shows that the conguration of n d-instantons corresponding
to (4.1) on t 2 with the bij background coincides with that of a d-string on t 2 with the
background

(4.10)

(4.11)

(4.12)

(4.13)

(4.14)

the last equation is exactly the same as in [32]. however, recalling that b
ij and f 
ij
are transformed to each other by the gauge transformations from the point of view of
the d-string, we are tempted to consider that there exist some gauge transformations
between 1/k and bij and interpret the identication (4.14) as a particular gauge xing.
next let us address the problem of deriving the equation like (2.19) in the d-instantons
if the u(n) gauge theory on the noncommutative

conguration under consideration.

12

tours correctly describes the n d-instantons on the torus with the bij ux as proposed
in [6, 14, 18], the consistency condition (2.19) must be automatically satised in the d-
instanton dynamics. as we have shown above, we can regard this conguration as the
d-string conguration on t 2 with the background 2f 
ij. then by
construction, the d-string have the d-instanton charge n and hence

ij + 2f

(4.15)

assuming that it winds m times around t 2,

f  =

.

(4.16)

according to the second equation in (4.13), this can be reinterpret in terms of the back-
ground of the conguration of d-instantons as

2

making the identication b12 =  exactly yields (3.46)

(4.17)

(4.18)

as expected, up to the sign which can be absorbed by the trivial redenition of the vari-
ables. since k and  denote the noncommutativities of the world volume of d-instantons
and the target space respectively, this result implies that they are closely related through
the non-trivial equation (4.17), which can be naturally understood from the point of view
of the twisted bundle on the noncommutative torus. thus we conrm the proposal made
in [6, 14, 18] that n d-instantons on the t 2 with bij ux can be described by the u(n)
twisted gauge theory on the noncommutative torus by regarding the conguration of the
d-instantons as that of a d-string in the context of the perturbative bosonic string theory.
there m is interpreted as the winding number of the resulting d-string. the same inter-
pretation is also made in [4, 13, 14, 18, 20] and seems natural for the following reason, for
example. setting  = b12 = 0 in (4.17) yields

2kn = (2s)2m,

(4.19)

which is consistent with the physical picture that each d-instanton has cell of area 2k
because of the world volume noncommutativity (4.1) and the d-string wrapped m times
over t 2 consists of n such cells.

5 conclusions and discussions

we have constructed the boundary state which realizes the ncg representations of d-
branes on noncommutative torus. from our construction the dual nature of the non-
commutativity of the world volume and that of the target space can be seen naturally.

13

also our analysis is consistent with the conjecture that the gauge theories on the world
volumes of d-branes compactied on a torus with the background 2-form eld should be
described by those on the noncommutative torus.

some remarks are in order:
we have used a particular representation of the d-brane coordinates qi

q1 = 2is1,

q2 = 2is(2  if 1).

(5.20)

there is an arbitrariness in the term proportional to f due to a gauge transformation by
an arbitrary function of j. it is an automorphism of the algebra on the noncommutative
world volume because it preserves the algebra of qis and js. thus, in the sense of ncg,
it should give (a part of) dieomorphism of the world volume. actually, a function of j
is nothing but a function of j so that it brings about a canonical transformation of qi.
this is also consistent with the discussions in [32] that the longitudinal translation of the
d-brane corresponds to a kind of gauge transformation in the dual picture.

on the other hand, as noted below (3.20), one can modify the representation of the
boundary state by a function of xi which changes the expression of momentum conser-
vation. under the identication of the parameter  with 2-form gauge potential, this
transformation eectively gives gauge transformation of bij. from the string point of
view, the gauge transformation of bij is related to the conformal transformation. in this
sense, if noncommutative structures discussed here provide the space-time uncertainties
[29, 33, 34] which are considered to reect the conformal symmetries both in the world
volume and the target space, then our result seems to be consistent with the proposal in
[34] that two conformal symmetries play dual roles. it will be interesting to consider an
interpretation of the relation (3.46) in the light of the space-time uncertainty.
