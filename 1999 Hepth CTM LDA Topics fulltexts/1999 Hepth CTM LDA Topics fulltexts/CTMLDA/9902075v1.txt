abstract

finite temperature correlation functions in integrable quantum eld theo-

ries are formulated only in terms of the usual, temperature-independent form

factors, and certain thermodynamic lling fractions which are determined

from the thermodynamic bethe ansatz. explicit expressions are given for the

one and two-point functions.

i. introduction

integrable quantum eld theories in 1 + 1 space-time dimensions are fundamentally char-

acterized by their factorizable s-matrix [1]. the s-matrix along with certain bootstrap

axioms in principle characterize the matrix elements of elds in the space of asymptotic

multi-particle states (form factors) [2,3]. finally, the correlation functions at zero temper-

ature can be characterized by innite integral representations using the form factors. the

s-matrix also governs the thermodynamics of the system through the thermodynamic bethe

ansatz (tba) [4].

for many applications, especially in condensed matter physics (see, for instance [6]),

the nite temperature correlation functions are of importance. in the matsubara imaginary

time formalism [7], nite temperature correlation functions can be viewed as correlation

functions on an innite cylindrical geometry, where the spacial coordinate  < x < 
runs along the length of the cylinder and the euclidean time lives on a circle of radius

r = 1/t , where t is the temperature. in a picture where the hamiltonian evolution is along

the circumference of the cylinder, let us call it the r-channel, the hilbert space lives on the

innite line of the coordinate x, thus the states of the hilbert space one has to sum over

in performing thermodynamic averages have the usual multi-particle description in innite

volume. deceptively simple as it may appear, this is an important observation, since it

implies that in this picture, the matrix elements of operators do not depend on r, and can

be expressed then by the usual, temperature-independent form factors. formally, one has

hoir =

1
z

tr(cid:16)erho(cid:17)

(r  channel)

(1.1)

where z is the partition function. in this paper we use the r-channel to formulate the nite

temperature correlation functions, the main goal being to use the thermodynamic bethe

ansatz to make sense of (1.1). we show that the correlation functions can be characterized

using only the usual form factors and some thermodynamic data, the so-called lling frac-

tions, which are available from the tba. we present explicit integral representations for the

one and two point correlation functions.

2

our formulation should be contrasted to the orthogonal picture, where hamiltonian evo-

lution is viewed as along the length of the cylinder (x-direction). in this l-channel, the

hilbert space is on the nite volume r, and the computation of correlation functions does

not involve the sum over thermodynamic states but rather involves the notion of the ground

state |0ri on the circle of radius r

hoir = h0r|o|0ri

(l  channel)

(1.2)

presently, the precise structure of this ground state has not been identied and moreover, in

this l-channel, matrix elements of operators may depend on r in a complicated unknown

way. there has been however some progress in this direction by smirnov. in fact, in a series

of papers [8], he studied properties of such matrix elements in a semi-classical limit.

ii. one-point functions

since the main features of the nite temperature calculation of correlation functions are

already present in the simplest case of the onepoint function of a quantum eld operator

o, let us start the discussion from the analysis of this case. throughout this paper we let
r = 1/t , where t is the temperature. to simplify the following discussion, we assume that

in the eld theory in question there is one kind of particle a of mass m. generalization to

other cases is quite easy. multi-particle states are denoted as |1,   , ni, where  is the
rapidity parameterizing the energy and momentum

e() = m ch,

k() = m sh .

our aim is to show that the previous expression can actually be organized in a way which

better reveals its physical content and which moreover provides an ecient method for its

actual computation.

in addition, we will also show that the nal form of the onepoint

functions may be regarded as a generalization of the formula obtained in the case of a free

theory, once an appropriate dictionary between the interacting and free theories has been

established. for this reason, let us initially consider the case of a free fermionic model1, i.e.

an integrable model with s-matrix s = 1. this case was originally studied in [9]. for the
following considerations, we need in particular to recall the main ndings reported in the

appendix a of [9].

a. main results in the free case

in carrying out the sum over states it is important to include -function contributions

to the form factors as follows. let a = {n    1} and b = {1    m} denote some ordered
sets of rapidities. then the form factor is expressed as a sum over all ways of breaking up

a and b into two sets:

ha|o(x, t)|bi =

xa=a1a2;b=b1b2

sa,a1sb,b1ha2|b2iha1|o(x, t)|b1iconn ,

(2.4)

where sa,a1 are s-matrix factors required to bring |ai into the order |a2,a1i, i.e. ha| =
sa,a1ha2,a1|, and similarly for |bi. the inner products ha2|b2i are most easily evaluated
by introducing free particle creation-annihilation operators |1    ni = a(1)    a(n)|0i,

1in this paper we consider only fermionic theories with s( = 0) = 1. the formal extension
to bosonic theories with s( = 0) = 1 is a simple exercise.

4

and using {a(), a()} = 2(  ); they are sums of products of -functions. the
connected piece of the form factor ha1|o(x, t)|b1iconn is dened to be the form factor
with no overlap, i.e. ha1|b1i = 0. the crossing relation is thus valid and one can dene
i0h0|o|1    m, n  i + in,   , 1  i + i1i(cid:19)
hn    1|o|1    miconn  f p(cid:18) lim

(2.5)

where f p in front of the expression means taking its nite part, i.e. terms proportional

to (1/i)p, where p is some positive power, and also terms proportional to i/j, i 6= j are
discarded in taking the limit. with this prescription the resulting expression is independent

of the way in which the above limits are taken, and it is therefore the only quantity which

has an unambiguous physical meaning. this way of taking the limit has been already used

in the literature (see [10]).

there are two eects of the -function terms coming from ha2|b2i when a 6= a1. the
rst eect is due to terms involving [(  )]2; these give rise to an overall factor which
sums up to the partition function z, and therefore cancels out from the nal result. the

other eect of the -functions is to give rise to a lling-fraction f () for integrations over

rapidity. the nal expression of the onepoint functions is then given by

ho(x, t)ir =

1

n!z d1
2   

xn=0

dn

2   nyi=1

f (i)e(i)! hn    1|o(0)|1    niconn ,

(2.6)

where here  = e()r, the connected form factor is dened in (2.5), and

f () =

1

1 + e()

.

in the following it will be convenient to introduce the functions

f() =

1

1 + e()

.

(2.7)

(2.8)

so that f = f+ and f e = f. as we will show below, the expression (2.6) for the onepoint
function is the one which generalizes to the interacting case.

5

b. interacting case. quasiparticle excitations

let us now turn to the interacting case. again, for simplicity, we assume the theory has

a spectrum given by a single particle a of mass m with an s-matrix s(). we dene

() = i log s(),

() = i

d
d

log s() .

(2.9)

the partition function at a nite temperature t and on a volume l (for l  ) is deter-
mined by means of the the thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations as follows [4,5]. in a

box of large volume l, 0 < x < l, the quantization condition of the momenta is given by

eik(i)lqj6=i s(i  j) = 1, which can be equivalently expressed as

ml shi +xj6=i

(i  j) = 2ni ,

(2.10)

where ni are integers. introducing a density of occupied states per unit volume 1() as well

as a density of levels (), in the thermodynamic limit eq. (2.10) becomes

where (f  g)() =r 



2 = e + 2  1 ,

df (  )g()/2. dening the pseudo-energy () as

1


=

1

1 + e ,

(2.11)

(2.12)

the minimization of the free-energy with respect to the densities of states leads to the integral

equation

 = er    log(1 + e) ,

and the partition function is then given by

z(l, r) = exp"mlz d

2

ch log(cid:16)1 + e()(cid:17)# .

(2.13)

(2.14)

the interesting point is that the above partition function can be interpreted as one of a

free gas of fermionic particles but with energy given by ()/r. namely, there is a oneto

one correspondence between the above expression (2.14) and a partition function computed

according to the following sum

6

z(l, r) =

1

n!z d1
2   

xn=0

dn
2 hn    1|1    ni

nyi=1

e(i) ,

(2.15)

where the scalar products of the states are computed by applying the standard free fermionic

rules. to see this, let us dene

f (r) =z d

2

ch log(cid:16)1 + e()(cid:17) ,

which admits the series expansion

where

f (r) =

(1)n+1

n

xn=0

in(r) ,

in(r) z d

2

ch en() .

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

the partition function obtained by the tba equation has the following expansion in powers

of (ml)

z(l, r) = 1 + (ml)f (r) +

(ml)2

2!

(f (r))2 +   

(ml)n

n!

(f (r))n +   

(2.19)

let us now compute the partition function by using the other expression (2.15), with a

regularization of the squares of the -functions appearing in hn    1|1    ni as for a free
fermionic theory on a suciently large volume l:

[(  )]2 

ml
2

ch() (  ) .

hence

z(l, r) = 1 + z1 + z2 +    zn +   

where for the rst terms we have

(2.20)

(2.21)

d(  ) < | > e() =

(2.24)

(2.25)

it is not dicult to carry on to higher order and to show that the series (2.15) precisely

coincides with the one of eq. (2.19), the only dierence being in the arrangement of the single

terms. for instance, collecting the terms proportional to (ml) in all zn, one simply obtains

for their sum f (r), whereas the sum of the terms proportional to (ml)n appearing in all

zn gives rise to the higher power (f (r))n.

the above remarkable fact can be interpreted as meaning that all physical properties

of the system can be extracted by the quasi-particle excitations above the tba thermal

ground state. these excitations have dressed energy ee = ()/r and dressed momenta ek():

(2.26)

ee() = ()/r ,

ek() = k() + 2(  1)() .

in this context, the rapidity  plays then the role of a variable which simply parameterizes

the dispersion relation of the quasiparticle excitations. this result was already understood

in a nonrelativistic situation by yang and yang [5] and a generalization of their result in

our relativistic context is given for convenience in appendix a.

in the light of these considerations, let us return now to the sum (2.3).

it is now

clear that if we replace e() by ee() and proceed to evaluate the sum as in the free theory

using (2.4), the partition function will properly be factored out and be canceled by the z

in the denominator, and furthermore the lling fractions will again be generated with 

now given by the tba pseudo-energy. thus, one obtains precisely the same formulae as

(2.6, 2.7). we emphasize that the connected form factor appearing in (2.6) is the usual

8

(temperature-independent) form factor. then the interpretation of eq. (2.6) is quite clear,

i.e. each multiparticle state contributes to the thermal sum with its t = 0 form factor but

each is weighted with the thermal probability of the occupation of that state, as determined

selfconsistently by the tba equations.

a non-trivial check of the above claim is readily available for the trace of the energy

momentum tensor o = t 
extracted and they depend only on the model through the function . for the rst ones we

 . the connected form-factors of this operator can be easily

have

 |iconn = 2m2 ;

h|t 
 |1, 2iconn = 4m2(1  2)ch(1  2) ,

h2, 1|t 

and inductive application of the form factor residue equations leads to

hn    1|t 

 |1    niconn = 2m2 (12)(23) ,   (n1,n) ch(1n)

+ permutations

(2.27)

(2.28)

(2.29)

where ij = i  j. for the aim of computing the thermal trace (i.e. considered as inserted
into integral expressions over i), the last expression can be taken as

hn    1|t 

 |1    niconn = 2m2 n! (12)(23) ,   (n1,n) ch(1n) .

(2.30)

finally, the vacuum expectation value of this operator is given by

 |0 > (t

(2.31)

where i are the resonance angles entering the twobody scattering amplitude of the particle

(in the more general case, one should consider the scattering amplitude of the particle with

the lightest mass). therefore we have

the n-th term of this series can be represented by the graph

9

where the dots are associated to the weights f(i), the thick lines between the dots to the
functions (i  i+1) and the dotted line which links the ending dots to ch(1n).

on the other hand, ht 

 ir can be computed directly from the tba [4] as

ht

where the functions r and  satisfy linear integral equations which can be easily solved.

in fact, dene the kernel

then, by dierentiating the integral equation (2.13) one obtains

(1 ck)r = e,

where (ckr)() r dck(, )r()/2. introducing the resolvent bl satisfying

we have

(1 + bl)(1 ck) = 1 ,

using 1 + bl =pn=0ck n, one can easily express the above in an integral series:

r = (1 + bl)e

1

1 + e e! + ...

r = e +    e

(2.35)

(2.36)

and similarly for . substituting these series into (2.34) one then nds a perfect agreement

with expression (2.32).

a model with one particle whose computation of onepoint functions can be explicitly

performed is provided by the sinh-gordon model. this is briey discussed in the next

section.

c. onepoint functions in the sinhgordon model

the sinh-gordon theory is dened by the action

(2.41)

where  is the so-called renormalized coupling constant (g) = g2

. for real values of

g the s-matrix has no poles in the physical sheet and hence there are no bound states. the

function () of this model is explicitly given by

() =

2 sin  cosh 
cosh2   cos2 

.

(2.42)

we are interested, in particular, in computing the onepoint functions of the exponential

operators of this theory, k(x) = ekg. to this aim, let us recall the general structure of the

form-factors of the sinh-gordon model, as determined in [11,12], specializing at the end to

the operators in question.

for scalar operators, the formfactors of the theory can be parameterized as follows

fn(1, . . . , n) = hn qn(x1, . . . , xn) yi<j

fmin(ij)
(xi + xj) ,

(2.43)

where xi  ei and ij = i  j. fmin() is an analytic function explicitly given by

where the last equation is particularly important for the computation at a nite temperature.

hn are normalization constants, which can be conveniently chosen as h2n+1 = h12n, h2n =

2 . in absence of additional requirements on the formfactors,

h22n2, with  (cid:16) 4 sin()
fmin(i,)(cid:17) 1

h1, h2 are two independent parameters. finally, the functions qn(x1, . . . , xn) are symmetric

polynomials in the variables xi, which are xed by the residue equations satised by the form

factors and whose total and partial degrees depend on the specic operator. in general, they

can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials (n)

k (x1, . . . , xn), dened

by the generating function

where mij(k) is an (n  1)  (n  1) matrix with entries2

mij(k) = 2ij [i  j + k] ,

(2.47)

(2.48)

and the vertical lines denote the determinant of that matrix. these polynomials depend
on an arbitrary number k and satisfy qn(k) = (1)n+1qn(k). formfactors of several

2for simplicity the dependence of qn(k) on the variables xi has been suppressed.

12

operators can be expressed in terms of the polynomials qn(k). for instance, the whole set
of ff of the elementary eld (x) are given by qn(0), with the choice h1 = 1/2, h2 = 0
whereas those of t 
 (x), are given by the even polynomials q2n(1), with the choice h1 = 0,

h2 = 2m2.

the formfactors of the exponential operators k(x) = ekg, are just given by the qn(k),

with the normalization constants xed to be h k

2 = 2[k]. since the onepoint
function of operators which are odd under the z2 symmetry    is identically zero,
the onepoint correlators at nite temperature involving the exponential elds coincide with

1 = [k], h k

those of the even combination k + k. using the prescription (2.5) one nds

the expressions for higher terms are rather complicated and are not given here. however,

one can easily check that for k = 1, the above expression coincides with the corresponding
series of the trace of the stressenergy tensor3. the plots of some of these quantities for

some values of the coupling constant are shown in figure 1. notice that if the operator k

is on resonance with the value of the coupling constant, namely if k = n, where n is an

integer, its onepoint function coincides with its vacuum matrix element only. moreover,

varying , there may be a swapping of the proles associated to the onepoint functions of

dierent k.

d. low and hightemperature limits of the onepoint functions

let us discuss in more detail the behavior of the onepoint correlators (2.6) as functions

of the temperature. first notice that if the anomalous dimension of the operator o is given
by 2o, its vacuum expectation value may be expressed as h0|o|0i  hoi0 = y m2o,
with y a pure number. hence, the series (2.6) relative to its onepoint function at nite

temperature can be cast in the scaling form

hoir
hoi0

= h(mr) ,

(2.51)

where h(mr) is a function of the scaling variable mr.

in the lowtemperature limit r  , the pseudoenergy goes as ()  mr cosh  and
therefore the n-th term of the series entering h(mr) vanishes asymptotically as en mr, so

that the leading correction is given by

h(mr)  1 + ha|o|ai



k0(mr) +   

(2.52)

where k0(x) is the usual bessel function, and |ai = |i.

3for the check of the 3particle contribution one needs the trigonometric identity [3] = 1 + [2]2.

14

on the other hand, in the hightemperature limit r  0, the onepoint correlators may

become scaling invariant functions4 i.e.

hoir 

1
r ,

(2.53)

with a powerlaw exponent  ruled by the underlying conformal field theory. this is the

case, for instance, of massive integrable models obtained as a deformation of a conformal

field theory by a strong relevant eld. under this hypothesis, the limit r  0 can be
controlled by means of a conformal perturbation theory on the cylinder. let

a = acf t + z (x)d2x ,

(2.54)

be the action of the ocritical model, where (x) is the relevant operator which gives rise to
the massive integrable theory, with   m22. the general structure of the perturbation
series for the onepoint functions is then given by

hoir =

dn ,

nxn=0

where

dn =

()n
n!

zcylh|o(0)(x1)    (xn)|iconn d2x1    d2xn ,

(2.55)

(2.56)

and xi are points on the cylinder and the connected correlation functions are calculated in

the unperturbed cft. the eld  entering eq. (2.56) is relative to the conformal operator of

lowest anomalous dimension in the theory which plays the role of the vacuum state on the

cylinder (for a unitary model, this eld is the identity operator). notice that the rst term

of the series is given by

h|o|i =(cid:18) 2

r(cid:19)2o

co ,

(2.57)

4this is not always the case, because there are theories, like the thermal ising model, with

logarithmic behavior or models, like the sinh-gordon one, which present logarithmic corrections

which may spoil the pure power law behavior given in the text.

15

and this will be dierent from zero only if the conformal structure constant co does not
vanish. in this case, the exponent  in (2.53) will coincide with the anomalous dimension of

the eld o itself,  = 2o, otherwise the exponent  will be given by  = 2oq(22),
where the integer q is the rst nonvanishing term in the series (2.55).

the above considerations open up the possibility to extract conformal data out of the

hightemperature limit of the onepoint function. this is easily checked by the analysis of

some simple models which have only one massive particle in the spectrum.

1. yanglee model

the smatrix of the perturbed yanglee model was determined in [13] to be

therefore for () we have

s() =

tanh 1

() =

.

(2.58)

(2.59)

the only ocritical primary operator of the theory coincides with the trace of the stress

energy tensor. in the conformal limit it goes to the eld with the lowest anomalous dimension

2 = 2/5 which simultaneously plays the role of the vacuum of the cylinder. hence, in
this case we expect to nd for the exponent  = 2/5. in order to extract this parameter,
by taking the logarithm of both terms in (2.53)

  log r = lim

r0hoir

(2.60)

 is easily identied by isolating the terms proportional to  log r in the series of the right
hand side. observe that, factorizing the term (t 
 )0 in eq. (2.32), the logarithm of the series

(2.32) can be expressed in terms of the usual cluster expansion

(2.62)

following the tba analysis [4], it is known that in the limit r  0, the pseudoenergy ()
tends to a plateau of value 0 = logh5+1

estimate of  is obtained by the rst term of the right hand side of (2.61)

(2.64)

which is within 5% to the actual value  = 0.4. the next correction is obtained by isolating
the term proportional to  log r in the next term of the cluster expansion (2.61), which is
equivalent to computing the quantity

(2.65)

so that the estimate of  improves to the values

  0.394365...

(2.66)

which diers from the actual value by 1%.

the main result of these computations can be summarized by saying that the exponent

 will be expressed by a series (of alternating signs, for this model) whose terms involve, in

addition to the ratio (2.62), inverse powers of  and the plateau value 0.

2. the nonunitary model m3,5

another integrable model with only one massive excitation to which we can easily apply

the above consideration is the ocritical thermal deformation of the minimal model

17

m3,5, which has been previously studied in [1517]. the smatrix of the model is given by
2(cid:17) and therefore () = 1/ cosh . in the conformal limit, the trace
s() = i tanh 1
of the stressenergy tensor tends to the conformal eld o of anomalous dimension 2 = 2/5
and this eld has a nonvanishing structure constant with the eld  of anomalous dimension

2(cid:16)  i 

2 = 1/10 which plays the role of vacuum state of the cylinder. hence we expect that the
exponent  of this theory should be equal to 2/5. by using the same arguments as above,

with the additional data

2m2
(t 
 )0

= 2 ,

0 =  log"5 + 1

2

# ,

(2.67)

for the rst estimate of the exponent  we have

1 + 5
3 + 5

2


 

= 0.393453...

(2.68)

which is within 1% of the actual value  = 0.4. in this model, the fact that the rst term of

the cluster series gives a better approximation to  seems to be related to the vanishing of

the next leading correction in the cluster expansion.

iii. two-point functions

having understood the main features of the one-point functions, the same reasoning

applies to the higher point functions. in this section we focus on the two-point functions.

we begin with the double summation over states

ho(x, t)o(0)ir =

1

z x,

ee rh|o(x, t)|ih|o(0)|i .

(3.1)

as explained in [9], for a free theory the terms in (2.4) with a1 6= a give rise to three kinds
of contributions:
(i). terms that diverge in innite volume involving [(  )]2 which can be arranged into
an overall factor of z.
(ii). terms that give rise to factors of the one-point function (hoir)2.

18

(iii). terms that modify the integration over rapidity for both the  and  states by the

same lling fraction f .

the remaining contributions are only expressed in terms of connected form-factors for which

crossing symmetry is valid. as for the one-point function, the only dierence between the

free and interacting theory is that e, k should be replaced by the tba dressed quantities

ee,ek. a further justication of this will be given below.
introduce an index  = 1 for the  particles and  = 1 for the  particles. for the 
particles the integrations r d are accompanied by f () dened in (2.7), whereas for the 
particles one has f ()e() due to the eer in (3.1). these factors can be expressed as f()
as dened in (2.8). by using the crossing symmetry, the connected form factors appearing

in (3.1) are h|o(0)|iconn = h + i, |o(0)|0i, where  + i denotes all rapidities shifted
by i. we can describe this by dening

h0|o|1    ni1n = h0|o|1  ie1,   n  ieni ,

(3.2)

where e = (  1)/2  {0, 1}. finally,
ho(x, t)o(0)ir = (hoir)2 xn =0

n! xi=1z d1

,

dn

2 

nyj=1

fj (j) exp(cid:16)j(teej + ixekj)(cid:17) (3.3)

a non-trivial check of the above expression is the kubo-martin-schwinger formula [20],

where eej,ekj = ee(j),ek(j).
which for a bosonic operator o reads

ho(x, t + r)o(0)ir = ho(0)o(x, t)ir .

(3.4)

shifting t by r in (3.3) gives the factor e. noting that fe = f, we simply relabel
the particles    in the sum. since ho(0)o(x, t)i = ho(x,t)o(0)i, then (3.4) holds
as long as

|h0|o(0)|1    ni1n|2 = |h0|o(0)|1    ni1n|2

.

(3.5)

19

the latter identity can be proven as follows. let |  iei denote |1  ie1,   , n 
ieni and h + ie| denote hn + ien ,   , 1 + ie1|. then,

|h0|o(0)|1    ni1n|2 = h0|o|  ieih + ie|o|0i .

under the transformation   , one has e  e  1. for local operators, the form

factor is invariant under a shift of all rapidities by the same constant, thus

(3.6)

(3.7)

|h0|o(0)|1    ni1n|2 = h0|o| + ieih  ie|o|0i
= h0|o|  ieih + ie|o|0i ,

where we have used crossing symmetry in the second line. the orders of rapidities in (3.7)

can be brought to the order in (3.6) using h0|o|    i, j,  i = s(i j)h0|o|    j, i,  i.
in doing this one always encounters the pair of factors s(  i)s(  i). using crossing
s() = s(i  ) and unitarity s()s() = 1, the latter factor equals 1. thus, (3.5) holds.

iv. conclusions

we have proposed explicit integral representations for the one and two-point correla-

tion functions at nite temperature involving form factors and the tba pseudo-energy-

momentum. several checks were performed, in particular we showed that for the trace of

the energy momentum tensor, our expression for the one-point function coincides precisely

with the tba result. we also checked that the kubo-martin-schwinger relation holds for

the two-point function.

we close by listing some possible applications of our formalism that deserve further

investigation. by extending our results to boundary eld theories at nite temperature,

as was done for the free case in [9], it should be possible to study the nite temperature

properties of conductivities in quantum wires with impurities. another application is to the

study of nite temperature crossovers in the vicinity of a zero temperature quantum phase

transition (for a review see [18]). finally there is the issue of spin-diusion in quantum spin

20

chains, which would require the study of the innite temperature limit of the continuum

version of a spin-spin two-point correlation function [19].

appendix a. tba dressed energy and momentum

let (nj, j) and (nj, j) be two bethe states both satisfying (2.10), where nj = nj except

for j = . subtracting the two equations one obtains

ml(cid:16)shj  shj(cid:17) =xi

(j  i)  (j  i) .

(j 6= ). since j  j we can introduce a function () and write

l(cid:16)shj  shj(cid:17)  (j)chj

.

in this thermodynamic limit, (4.1) can be written as

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

2(1 ck)() = (  )  (  ) ,

where  is the previously introduced density of levels and ck is dened in (2.35). one also

has

(  )  (  ) =z 





dck(, )(1 + e()) .

using the resolvent operator, as dened in (2.37), one has

() =z 





d

2 bl(, )(1 + e()) .

now consider the dierence in energy e between the two bethe states:

e = m ch  m ch + mz d sh

()()
1 + e()

.

substituting (4.5), and using the property bl(, )(1 + e()) = (1 + e())bl(, ), along with

(2.38) one nds

e =

1
r

(()  ()) .

the dressed momentum proceeds similarly:

p =xj

m shj  m shj =

= m sh  m sh + mz d ch

22

(4.7)

(4.8)

()()
1 + e()

.

again substituting (4.5) and using (2.38) one nds

p = ek() ek()

(4.9)

where ek is dened in (2.26).
