abstract

we apply stochastic quantization method to kostovs matrix-vector models for the

second quantization of orientable strings with chan-paton like factors, including both

open and closed strings. the fokker-planck hamiltonian deduces an orientable open-

closed string eld theory at the double scaling limit. there appears an algebraic structure

in the continuum f-p hamiltonian including a virasoro algebra and a su(r) current

algebra.

the explicit construction of non-critical string eld theories via the double scaling

limit of the matrix models [1] provides not only the basis for the non-perturbative anal-

ysis of string theories but also the clear understanding of the origin of the constraints

realized in the algebraic structure of the string eld theoretic hamiltonian [1-10]. the al-

gebraic structure in non-critical string eld theories has been investigated in this context

for orientable closed strings [2, 3, 4], non-orientable closed strings [6], orientable open-

closed strings [7, 8] and non-orientable open-closed strings[10]. for orientable 2d surfaces
with boundaries, an interesting algebraic structure, sl(r, c)  sl(r, c) chiral current al-
gebra including su(r) current algebra, has been found in a eld theoretic hamiltonian

of orientable open-closed str ings[9]. the observation indicates the relation between the

algebraic structure and a chan-paton like realization of gauge groups in open string

theories. while the so(r) current algebra has been found in the string eld theoretic

hamiltonian for non-orientable open-closed strings[10].

in this note, we construct non-critical orientable open-closed string eld theories for
0 < c  1 by applying stochastic quantization method to kostovs matrix-vector model[7,
11]. to introduce chan-paton like factors, we slightly modify kostovs model. the

continuum limit of the string eld theory is taken at the double scaling limit of this matrix-

vector model. we introduce the scale parameters on the boundaries which characterize

the scaling behaviour of the time evolution along the boundaries. we show that the string

eld theoretic hamiltonian, which is the continuum limit of the loop space fokker-planck

hamiltonian in stochastic quantization[3, 6], appears in the form of a linear combination

of three deformation generators of orientabl e strings which satisfy algebraic relations

including a virasoro algebra and a su(r) current algebra.

for orientable 2d surfaces with boundaries, the sum of triangulated surfaces is re-

constructed by the hermitian matrix-vector models[11, 12]. to introduce the orientable
open-closed string interactions for 0 < c  1, we consider kostovs matrix-vector model
with chan-paton like factors. the action is given by[7]

where the interactions of matrices, axx, take place only for |xx|  1 in the target space
z, i.e. x, x  z. namely, the relevant matrices are axx ij, which are n  n hermitian
matrices, and axx+1 ij = ax+1x ij. v a
x i and v ax i are n-dimensional complex vectors with
a chan-paton like factor a which runs from 1 to r. the partition function, z, and the

free energy, f , of this model are given by

2d surface with boundaries,   2  2#(handles)  #(boundaries). by integrating out
all the non-hermitian matrices, axx+1 ij and axx+1 ji, we obtain an eective action as a
x i and v ax i.

we denote the eective action as se(m, v, v ) [7].

we have introduced the scale parameter a

v a
x i and v ax i. at the double scaling limit, the parameter a
the stochastic time evolution of the open string end-point along the boundaries with the

x denes the time scale for

x i are dened by

< x ij( )x kl( ) > = 2 iljkxx ,

< ax i( )b

x j( ) > = 2a

x abijxx .

(4)

we will see later that the a

x-independence of the equilibrium is realized as the alge-

braic relation between the constraints in the string eld theoretic hamiltonian which is

equivalent to the integrability condition of the multi-time evoluti on of the langevin

equations.

now we dene the closed strings, x(l) = n1tr(eln 1/2mx) , and the open strings,
x (l) = n1(v aeln 1/2mxv b) . following to itos calculus, we calculate the time de-

we notice that < x(l) >=<  ab

especially, from eqs.

(5), the -independence of the equilibrium limit deduces a s-d

equation which ensures the su(r) current algebra.

we can describe a class of matrix-vector models for the central charge 0 < c  1 with

the following adjacency matrices[7].

c (c)
xx = cos(p0)(xx+1 + xx1) ,
c (o)
xx = cos(p0/2)(xx+1 + xx1) .

(7)

the case, p0 = 1/m, corresponds to the central charge, c = 1  6

m(m+1) .

the stochastic process is interpreted as the time evolution in a string eld theory. the

corresponding non-critical orientable open-closed string eld theory is dened by the f-

p hamiltonian operator. in terms of the expectation value of an observable o(, ), a

function of x(l)s and ab

x (l)s, the f-p hamiltonian operator hf p is dened by[6]

< (0), (0)|e hf p o( , )|0 >< o(( ), ( )) > .

(8)

appropriate initial conguration x(l;  = 0) and ab

in r.h.s., ( ) and ( ) denote the solutions of the langevin equations (5) with the
x (l;  = 0). in l.h.s., hf p is given
by the dierential operator in the well-known fokker-planck equation for the expectation

value of the observable o(, ) by replacing the closed ( open ) string variable x(l) (
x (l) ) to the creation operator x(l) ( ab

to the annihilation operator x(l) ( ab

x (l) ) and the dierential

x (l) ), respectively.

the continuum limit of hf p is taken by introducing a length scale   which denes
the physical length of the strings as l  l. at the double scaling limit   0, we keep
the string coupling constant, g  n22d , to be nite. the continuum stochastic time
is given by d  2+d . while we dene the scaling of the scale parameter a

in the precise sense, these commutation relations are not an algebra because the open

string creation operators ab(l) appear in the r.h.s. of (13). the algebraic structure

(13) is understood as the consistency condition for the constraints on the equilibrium

expectation value or integrable conditionof the stochastic time evolution. the her-
mitian part of the current, j ab(l) + j ba(l), generates the s-d equation which implies
the -independence of the equilibrium distribution. while the anti-hermitian part of the
current, j ab(l)j ba(l), satises su(r) current algebra. the similar algebraic structure
is also found in ref.[9] in a discretized form without continuum limit.

in conclusion, we have derived the continuum f-p hamiltonian which denes the
non-critical orientable open-closed string eld theory for 0 < c  1 by applying sqm to
kostovs matrix-vector model. the origin of the algebraic structure (13) can be traced

to the noise correlations which generate the time evolution in the langevin equation.

namely, the noise correlations realize the deformation of open and closed strings which
are equivalent to those generated by the three constraints, l(l), j ab(l) and kab(l). we
have shown that the structure to be universal representing the scale invariance in the

non-critical orientable open-closed string theories. we hope that our approach is also

usefull to the non-perturbative analysis of superstring theories such as type iia, iib and

type i theories for which matrix models are proposed [14, 15] by the large n reduction of

super yang-mills theory.
