abstract

we give arguments in the support of a relation between m-atrix theory and mal-
dacenas conjecture. m-atrix theory conjecture implies the equivalence of 11-d light-
cone supergravity and strongly-coupled (0+1)-d sym. maldacenas sugra/sym
duality conjecture implies, in the one dimensional sym case, the equivalence be-
tween strongly-coupled (0+1)-d sym and 11-d supergravity compactied on a
spatial circle in the formal seiberg-sen limit. using the classical equivalence be-
tween 11-d supergravity on a light-like circle and on a spatial circle in the formal
seiberg-sen limit, we argue that in the (0+1)-d sym case, the large-n m-atrix
theory in the supergravity regime is equivalent to sugra/sym duality.

1 introduction

m-atrix theory [1, 2] and maldacenas conjecture [3] are similar in the sense that both are
about the equivalence between m/string theories (i.e. theories in the bulk of space-time)
and brane world-volume theories. but does this similarity go beyond a mere analogy?
maldacenas conjecture relates m/string theory on a curved background to sym in the
at space, whereas m-atrix theory relates m-theory on a transverse torus to sym on
a dual torus.1 for example, consider nite-n m-atrix theory on a 3-torus. if v3 is the
volume of m-theory transverse 3-torus and rthe radius of light-like circle, then the
corresponding d=4 sym is dened on a dual 3-torus of volume v3 = (rm 3
. dual
p v3)1 also blows up in this
3-torus decompacties in the limit v3  0 , but g2
limit. in the large-n limit one has to take r  . thus we have g2
ym  1 and n  1,
and this limit is dierent from the one involved in ads5/cft4 correspondence.

these formal arguments do not, however, imply that the two conjectures are in conict
with each other, but rather suggest the following possibility. imagine two moduli spaces:
m1 of m-theory and m2 of sym (coordinates of these moduli spaces are: the dimension
d of sym, the rank n of gauge group, the type of gauge theory base space, the type of
space on which m-theory is compactied and so on). one can think of the two conjectures
as two one-to-one maps fmatrix and fmaldacena between certain regions of m1 and m2.
it is clear that if these mappings map two non-overlapping regions in m1 into two non-
overlapping regions in m2, it does not mean that they contradict each other (see figure
1). a natural question to ask is whether the domains of these two mappings intersect,
and if so, are the two mappings identical in the overlap? the motivation for writing this
paper was to answer this question.2

in this paper we will consider (0+1)-d sym case.3 one dimensional sym is simplest

1in what follows we will consider m-atrix theory in at backgrounds. m-atrix theory in curved

backgrounds is still very poorly understood [4].

2for some other discussions of m-atrix/maldacena relation, see refs. [510].
3supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics was rst studied in ref.[11].

in the sense that no compactication is involved. the purpose of this paper is to establish
a relation between large-n, uncompactied m-atrix theory in the supergravity regime and
sugra/sym duality (large-n version of maldacenas conjecture) in this one dimensional
case.

the paper is organized as follows.

in sec.2 we give a brief review m-atrix theory.
in sec.3 we discuss some aspects of sugra/sym duality and propose a new interpre-
tation of sugra/(0+1)-d sym duality.
in sec.4 we argue that m-atrix theory and
sugra/(0+1)-d sym duality are related by a classical equivalence between 11-d su-
pergravities on a light-like and a spatial circles.

2 m-atrix theory

the nite-n version of m-atrix theory conjecture [2], as claried by sen and seiberg
[12, 13], states that discrete light-cone quantization (dlcq) of m-theory (with the planck
scale mp and a transverse length scale x) compactied on a light-like circle (x  x +
r is equivalent to m -
2r) in the sector with the total longitudinal momentum p = n
theory (with the planck scale mp and a transverse length scale x) compactied on a
spatial circle (x11  x11 + 2 r) in the sector with the total kaluza-klein momentum
along the x11 direction p11 = n

r in the limit r  0 , mp   , with the xed
p = rm 2

x mp = xmp .

(2.1)

the large-n version of m-atrix theory conjecture [1] is a related statement about the
uncompactied 11-d light-cone m-theory. it is assumed that the large-n version of m-
atrix theory is the r, n   (with n/r = xed) limit of nite-n theory.

compelling arguments for the validity of nite-n m-atrix theory conjecture were given
by seiberg and sen [13, 12].4 let t be a eld theory (with a mass scale and a set of
dimensionless parameters {yi}) formulated on a at background (or on a background of
the form r1,1  m which has so(1, 1) isometry). let hdlcq
(m, r,{yi}) be the n-
body dlcq quantum mechanical hamiltonian describing the dynamics of the theory t
compactied on a light-like circle (x  x+2r) in the sector with the total longitudinal
momentum p = n
r . the dynamics of the theory t compactied on a small spatial circle
(x  x + 2 r) in the sector with n units of total momentum along the x direction is
also expected to be described by a non-relativistic n-body hamiltonian.5 we denote it
n ( m , r,{yi}). now, thinking of the light-like circle as an almost light-like circle
by hkk
and boosting it, one can show that

3 sugra/sym duality

the essence of sugra/sym duality is the following: surround a d-brane source in
supergravity by a sphere of radius . supergravity is a low energy limit of string theory
and hence, a priori, it is valid only outside of the sphere. it is claimed that if the curvature
and eective string coupling of the supergravity solution are small, supergravity is valid
also inside of the sphere. it should be noted that this idea does not give a precise recipe
for the sugra/sym correspondence. the rules of the game should be specied for a
particular supergravity background, etc. for example, in the ads/cft case, such a recipe
was given in refs.[15, 16]. in this case, the correspondence is between the uctuations of
supergravity elds on the curved ads background and sym operators. we are interested
in sugra/(0+1)-d sym duality which was discussed in ref.[17]. in the latter paper it
was argued that the motion of a d0-brane probe carrying one unit of rr-charge in the
curved near-horizon geometry of a source d0-brane of charge n  1 is dual to a process
in (0+1)-d sym with the gauge group u(n + 1) broken to u(n)  u(1) by a higgs
vev. motivated by ads/cft correspondence, one may argue that (0+1)-d sym is dual
to supergravity on a curved near-horizon d0-brane background. it seems that this is a
widely accepted point of view.6 let a be a proponent of this point of view and ba
proponent of the following interpretation (which is our interpretation): sugra/(0+1)-d
sym duality is a relation between the scattering of 11-d supergravity states in a at
background and the corresponding sym processes. the meaning of our interpretation is
best illustrated by the following discussion between a and b.

a: taking maldacenas low energy limit in the d0-brane metric, one obtains the metric
of curved near-horizon geometry of d0-brane. thus, (0+1)-d sym is dual to supergrav-
ity on the curved space. for example, consider the scattering of three d0-branes. let
the rst two of these d0-branes carry one unit of rr-charge each and the third one
carries n  1 units of rr-charge. one can think of the scattering of the rst two
d0-branes as taking place in the curved near-horizon geometry of the third d0-brane.
one should for instance use a curved-space propagator to compute scattering amplitudes.
this curved-space supergravity picture is dual to (0+1)-d sym with the gauge group
u(n + 2)  u(n)  u(1)  u(1).

6 for a discussion of ads2/sym0+1 duality see ref.[18]. we will argue that ads2/sym0+1 duality

conjecture of ref.[18] can be correct only approximately.

3

b: i agree that in the case of u(n + 2)  u(n) u(1) u(1) your curved-space picture
works. but i have problem with the other cases. suppose that the gauge group u(n) is
broken to u(n1)  u(n2)      u(nk) with ni  n. in this case i cannot talk about
scattering as taking place in a denite background since the back-reaction eects are not
negligible.
a: well, i think sugra/(0+1)-d sym duality in this case should be interpreted as a
duality between the excitations of supergravity elds on the near-horizon multi-center
d0-brane static background and sym processes. in ref.[19] the centers of multi-center
static solution were promoted to dynamical variables. by the way, an analogous point of
view, in the context of ads5/cft4 correspondence, was rst advocated in maldacenas
paper [3].
b: you forgot to mention one important point about ads5/cft4 correspondence on the
coulomb branch. sym4 has moduli space of supersymmetric vacua which is identical to
the parameter space of the general multi-center d3-brane solution. but we know that
(0+1)-d sym does not have moduli space of vacua because symmetry breaking scalar
expectation values are not frozen variables [20]. therefore, one cannot associate the pa-
rameter space of multi-center d0-brane solution with the moduli space of vacua of (0+1)-d
sym.
a: but may be instead of associating this parameter space with the moduli space of
vacua (which does not exist in susy matrix quantum mechanics), one should associate
it with the space of slow variables in a born-oppenheimer approximation. it was argued
in ref.[20] that born-oppenheimer approximation is justied in the large-n limit.
instead of trying to resolve problems inherent to the
b: i have little to say about it.
curved-space picture, i want to propose the following simple at-space picture. let
( r,  ) be a n-graviton scattering amplitude in the at 11-d supergravity com-
asu gra
pactied on a spatial circle of radius r. let asqm
be a corresponding susy quantum
mechanical amplitude. a simple recipe for the sugra/(0+1)-d sym reads

n

( r,  ) .

(3.1)

the curved-space picture is approximately correct and useful in some particular cases
like the case of broken u(n + 2)  u(n)  u(1)  u(1), but the at-space picture
is more general and contains the curved-space picture as a special case. note that by
the at space picture, i actually mean the procedure of calculating scattering amplitudes
in the supergravity on a at background and taking seiberg-sen limit in the resulting
amplitudes. in the at-space picture context, the curved-space picture emerges eectively
in some cases as a result of taking r  0 limit. the supergravity description that follows
from eq. (3.1) should be tested for its validity in each particular scattering problem.
the analysis of ref.[17] shows that supergravity description breaks down at long distances
r > n
3 lp. i think the latter inequality should be replaced by a more general one in the
case of u(n)  u(n1)      u(nk).
a:did not maldacena use the same arguments in his analysis [3]? namely, he started with
an asymptotically at d-brane metric, took a low energy limit   0 in it and obtained

1

4

an asymptotically curved metric.
b: the relation eq. (3.1) is a generalization of maldacenas idea of taking low energy limit
in the d-brane supergravity solution to the cases when there is no well-dened background
in which scattering takes place. moreover, i am emphasizing atness of supergravity
because the justication7 for taking r  0 limit in the supergravity amplitudes involves
a classical equivalence between supergravities on a light-like and a space-like circles, and
the latter equivalence requires the formulation of supergravity on a at background.

4 m-atrix theorysugra/sym duality relation

we see that in the m-atrix theory context (0+1)-d sym in the large-n limit is equivalent
to 11-d light-cone supergravity, and in the context of sugra/sym duality it is equivalent
to 11-d supergravity on a spatial circle in the formal seiberg-sen limit. assuming that m-
atrix theory and sugra/sym duality are related, this suggests that there should exist
a relation between light-cone 11-d supergravity and 11-d supergravity on a spatial circle
in the formal seiberg-sen limit (see figure 2). indeed, it was noticed in refs.[21, 22] that
the scattering potentials calculated in these two supergravities agree. it is also known
that innitely boosting the d0-brane supergravity solution is equivalent to taking a near-
horizon limit (seiberg-sen limit) [21]. the authors of refs.[6, 8] used this fact to argue
that sugra/sym duality and m-atrix theory are equivalent. their arguments can be
summarized as follows. motivated by the nite-n version of m-atrix theory, let us up-lift
the d0-brane sugra metric to 11-d and then compactify it on x. as a result, we nd
that the harmonic function h0 is replaced by h0  1. now rewrite this metric in terms
of new symbols (r, gs, etc.) that are related to the original ones (r, gs, etc.) by seiberg-
sens relations eq. (2.1). let us appropriately rescale (using seiberg-sens relations) the
resulting metric written in terms of new symbols. we nd that this rescaled metric is
precisely that of the d0-brane in the the near-horizon limit! so, we see the validity
of seiberg-sens prescription when applied to the background geometry of supergravity
associated with the dlcq of m-theory. we also see that (0+1)-d sym is equivalent to
uctuations8 of sugra elds on the curved near-horizon d0-brane background. since
we know that the latter statement is precisely that of sugra/sym duality, we seem to
have shown that sugra/sym duality follows from m-atrix theory.

there are two objections against their line of reasoning. first, the meaning of tak-
in seiberg-sens
ing seiberg-sen limit in the expression for the metric is not clear.
derivation of m-atrix theory, this limit was taken in the full m-theory and not just in
supergravity. second, the discussion of the authors of refs.[6, 8] seems to imply that
two m-theories formulated on the curved backgrounds are related via seibergs boost, but

7the discussion of this justication will be given below.
8we think these authors implicitly assumed this when they talked about the background geometry

etc.

the backgrounds they considered do not have so(1,1) isometry. but is not it the case that
in the seiberg-sens derivation of matrix theory one breaks lorentz invariance by com-
pactication on a circle? it is so, but the underlying theory is supposed to be an so(1,1)
invariant theory formulated on a background of the form r1,1  m. the backgrounds
considered in refs.[6, 8] are not so(1,1) isometric before the compactication.

we resolve the rst problem by clarifying the meaning of taking seiberg-sen limit
in supergravity expressions. its meaning is the classical equivalence of 11-d supergrav-
ities on light-like and spatial circles. the second problem is resolved by interpreting
sugra/(0+1)-d sym duality in a way dierent from what they did. we stated ear-
lier our interpretation of this duality in the one-dimensional case:
...a relation between
the scattering of supergravity states in a at background and the corresponding sym
processes.

in order to show that m-atrix theory and sugra/sym duality are related one has
to use the rectangle of relations (see figure 2) and the classical equivalence of two
supergravities. let us prove the classical equivalence of two supergravities. let us denote
n ( m , r,{yi}) classical hamiltonians of a theory compactied
by h l.c.
on light-like and spatial circles in the sectors with n units of longitudinal momentum. in
the hamiltonian formulation we associate them with the vector elds (/x+) and (/t).
the analog of eq. (2.2) in this classical case reads

n (m, r,{yi}) and h s.l.

h l.c.
n (m, r,{yi}) = lim

(4.1)

note that the statements expressed by eq. (2.2) and eq. (4.1) are very dierent. the latter
states the equivalence of two classical eld theory hamiltonians and the former states the
equivalence of two quantum mechanical n-body hamiltonians. it is the exploitation of
this dierence that enables us to relate the two conjectures. applying eq. (4.1) to 11-d
supergravity formulated in a at background, one establishes the classical equivalence

6

between the two supergravities.

it should be noted that our analysis is dierent from that of [5]. the arguments of the
authors of ref.[5] go as follows. from the expression for the 11d supergravity plane wave
solution ds2 = dx+dx + (q/r7)(dx)2 + dx2
i , one sees that x, the putative compact
null direction, is in fact spacelike for r < . thus it seems that the gravitational
eects automatically provide with the almost light-likeness of the circle which is crucial
in seibergs derivation of m-atrix theory. it is the reason why supergravity solution is
valid at short distances. as we understand, the discussion of refs.[10] seems to imply
that the dlcq quantization of m-theory in such a plane wave background cannot yield
a theory of pure d0-branes (an ordinary matrix susy quantum mechanics) because the
circle is only asymptotically null and negative momentum modes do not decouple. in our
analysis the validity of supergravity solution at short distances follows from the matrix
theory conjecture and the classical equivalence of 11-d supergravities on a light-like and
a spatial circles, and therefore, our analysis is dierent from that of ref.[5].

let us give some examples [21, 22] which illustrate eq. (4.1). the potential for
graviton-graviton scattering with no longitudinal momentum transfer in 11-d supergrav-
ity compactied on a light-like circle reads [21]

sponding expression for the graviton-graviton scattering potential in 11-d supergravity
compactied on a spatial circle reads

it would be interesting to extend these scattering potential calculations to the cases in-
volving longitudinal momentum exchange, recoil eects, etc. in view of relation eq. (4.1),
one expects agreement in these cases. note that the equivalence between two supergrav-
ities holds for arbitrary n, but in relating m-atrix theory and sugra/sym duality we
use only the equivalence for large n.10

let us conclude by summarizing our arguments. m-atrix theory conjecture implies the
equivalence of strongly coupled one dimensional sym and 11-d light-cone supergravity.

9in ref.[22] an equivalent potential was obtained from ten dimensional iia supergravity. it is easier

to obtain it directly from 11-d supergravity, starting with the membrane probe action s = r ldt =
t2r d3x(detgmn  ctx1x2  x11cx11x1x2) and performing legendre transformation l  l =
l( x11(p11))  x11p11 .

1011-d supergravity on a light-like circle at nite-n is not necessarily the same as the low energy limit
of dlcq m-theory [23] and therefore the equivalence of two supergravities at nite-n is useless for our
purposes.

8

on the other hand, sugra/sym duality implies the equivalence of one dimensional
sym and 11-d supergravity on a spatial circle in sen-seibergs limit. we showed that the
hamiltonian of 11-d supergravity on a light-like circle is equal to a limit of the hamiltonian
of 11-d supergravity on a spatial circle. in this way we argued that the large-n m-atrix
theory in the supergravity regime and sugra/(0+1)-d sym duality are equivalent.
