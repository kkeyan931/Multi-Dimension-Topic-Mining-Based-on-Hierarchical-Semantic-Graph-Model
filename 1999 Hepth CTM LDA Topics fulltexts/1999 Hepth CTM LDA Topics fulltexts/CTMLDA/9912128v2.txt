abstract

quantum gravity coupled to scalar massive matter elds is investigated
in the framework of causal perturbation theory. one-loop calculations in-
clude matter loop graviton self-energy and matter self-energy and yield
ultraviolet nite and cuto-free expressions. perturbative gauge invariance
to second order implies the usual slavnovward identities for the gravi-
ton self-energy in the loop graph sector and generates the correct quartic
graviton-matter interaction in the tree graph sector. the mass zero case is
also discussed.

introduction

in this paper we follow the quantum eld theoretical approach to gravitational
interactions coupled to scalar matter elds (see the introduction to this subject
in [1] and reference therein). this approach allows a quantization of the in-
volved elds, matter and graviton elds, and a lorentz covariant perturbative
expansion of the scattering matrix s.

calculations of matter loop diagrams in this conventional framework led to
non-renormalizable ultraviolet (uv) divergences [2]. these were later conrmed
by means of dimensional regularization and background eld method, both in
the massive [3] and in the massless [4], [5] case.

the counterterms needed to cancel the divergences are not of the type
present in the original lagrangian density. according to these ndings, quantum
gravity (qg) coupled to matter elds does not full the criterion of perturbative
renormalizability [6].

we show how it is possible to overcome these discouraging outcomes by
applying an improved perturbation scheme which has as central objects the
time-ordered products and as constructing principle causality. the s-matrix is
constructed inductively as a sum of smeared operator-valued n-point distribu-
tions avoiding uv divergences.

this idea goes back to stuckelberg, bogoliubov and shirkov and the pro-
gram (causal perturbation theory) was carried out successfully by epstein and
glaser [7] for scalar eld theories and subsequently applied to qed by scharf [8],
to non-abelian gauge theories by dutsch et al. [9] and to quantum gravity [10]
in the last years.

in addition, qg has considerable gauge properties [11], which are formulated
by means of a gauge charge that generates innitesimal gauge variations of the
fundamental free quantum elds, sec 2.3.

the present work focuses mainly on three aspects of qg coupled to massive
matter elds. brief remarks for the massless case are given for these aspects. the
rst aspect is the uv niteness of loop graphs, which include the lowest order
massive and massless scalar matter loop corrections to the graviton propagator,
sec. 3, and the matter self-energy, sec. 4. the result are uv nite and cuto-free
due to techniques of causal perturbation theory.

the second aspect consists in the investigation of the gauge properties of the
graviton self-energy, sec. 2.4. gauge invariance of the s-matrix implies some
identities between the c-number parts of the n-point distributions which yield
the gravitational slavnovward identities (swi) [12], sec. 3.3.

the third aspect of this work is also connected with gauge invariance: per-
turbative gauge invariance to second order in the tree graph sector requires
the introduction, at a purely quantum level, of a quartic matter-graviton in-
teraction exactly as prescribed by the expansion of the classical matter-gravity
lagrangian, sec. 5.

the quantization of the graviton eld, the identication of the physical sub-

3

space and the proof of s-matrix unitarity are investigated in [13], which provides
also the conventions and the notations used here. calculations involving gravi-
ton self-couplings are not considered here, see [14].

the causal scheme applied to quantum gravity coupled to photon elds leads
also to very satisfactory results with regard to the uv niteness in loop calcu-
lations and to the gauge invariance [15].

we use the unit convention:  = c = 1, greek indices , , . . . run from 0 to

3, whereas latin indices i, j, . . . run from 1 to 3.

2 quantized mattergravity system and perturba-

tive gauge invariance

2.1 inductive construction of two-point distributions in the

s-matrix expansion

in causal perturbation theory [8], [16], the ansatz for the s-matrix as a power
series in the coupling constant is central, namely s is considered as a sum of
smeared operator-valued distributions

s(g) = 1 +



xn=1

1

n!z d4x1 . . . d4xn tn(x1, . . . , xn) g(x1)  . . .  g(xn) ,

(2.1)

where the schwartz test function g  s(r4) switches the interaction and provides
a natural infrared cuto. the s-matrix maps the asymptotically incoming free
elds on the outgoing ones and it is possible to express the tns by means of
free elds without introducing interacting quantum elds.

the n-point distribution tn is a well-dened renormalized time-ordered

product expressed in terms of wick monomials of free elds :o(x1, . . . , xn):

tn(x1, . . . , xn) =xo

:o(x1, . . . , xn) : to

n (x1  xn, . . . , xn1  xn) .

(2.2)

the tn are c-number distributions. tn is constructed inductively from the rst
order t1(x), which describes the interaction among the quantum elds, and
from the lower orders tj, j = 2, . . . , n  1 by means of poincare covariance and
causality. the latter leads directly to a uv nite and cuto-free distribution
tn.

for the purpose of this paper, we outline briey the main steps in the con-
struction of t2(x, y) from a given rst order interaction. following the inductive
scheme, we rst calculate the causal operator-valued distribution

in order to obtain d2(x, y), one has to carry out all possible contractions between
the normally ordered t1 using wicks lemma, so that d2(x, y) has the following

2(x, y) =(cid:2)t1(x), t1(y)(cid:3) .

(2.3)

d2(x, y) := r

2(x, y)  a

4

structure

d2(x, y) =xo

:o(x, y) : do

2 (x  y) .

(2.4)

do
2 (xy) is a numerical distribution that depends only on the relative coordinate
x  y, because of translation invariance.
d2(x, y) contains tree (one contraction), loop (two contractions) and vac-
uum graph (three contractions) contributions. due to the presence of normal
ordering, tadpole diagrams do not show up. in this paper we do not consider
vacuum graphs. d2(x, y) is causal, i.e. supp(do
2 (z))  v +(z)  v (z), with
z := x  y.
in order to obtain t2(x, y), we have to split d2(x, y) into a retarded part,
r2(x, y), and an advanced part, a2(x, y), with respect to the coincident point
z = 0, so that supp(r2(z))  v +(z) and supp(a2(z))  v (z). this splitting,
or time-ordering, has to be carried out in the distributional sense so that the
retarded and advanced part are well-dened and uv nite.

the splitting aects only the numerical distribution do
2 (x  y) and must
be accomplished according to the correct singular order (do
2 ) which describes
roughly speaking the behaviour of do
2 (p) in the
limit p  . if  < 0, then the splitting is trivial and agrees with the standard
time-ordering. if   0, then the splitting is non-trivial and non-unique:

2 (x  y) is usually obtained in momentum space
eq. (2.5) contains a local ambiguity in the normalization: the ca,os are
undetermined nite normalization constants, which multiply terms with point
support da(4)(x  y) (da is a partial dierential operator). this freedom in
the normalization has to be restricted by physical conditions.
2(x, y) from r2(x, y) and the whole

finally, t2 is obtained by subtracting r

local normalization coming from (2.5) is called n2(x, y).

2.2 quantized matter-gravity interaction

we consider the coupling between the quantized symmetric tensor eld h (x),
the graviton, and the quantized scalar eld (x), the matter eld, in the back-
ground of a minkowski space-time.

the free scalar eld of mass m satises the kleingordon wave equation

( + m2)(x) = 0 ,

(2.6)

5

which follows from the free matter lagrangian density l(0)
the matter energy-momentum tensor reads

where  = diag(+1,1,1,1) and it fulls t 
scalar eld is accomplished through
(cid:2)(x), (y)(cid:3) = i dm(x  y) ,

where

dm(x) = d(+)

m (x) + d()

m (x) =

i

(2)3z d4p (p2  m2) sgn(p0) ei px

is the causal jordanpauli distribution of mass m.

the free graviton eld satises the wave equation

 h (x) = 0

and is quantized (see [13]) according to

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

where the b-tensor is constructed from the minkowski metric

(cid:2)h (x), h (y)(cid:3) = i b d0(x  y) ,
2(cid:16) +    (cid:17)

b :=

1

and d0(x) is the jordanpauli distribution of eq. (2.9) with m = 0.

the graviton eld interacts with the conserved energy-momentum tensor of

the matter elds. the rst order matter coupling is chosen to be

t m
1 (x) = i


2

: h(x) b t 

m (x) := i



2(cid:8) : h ,, : 

m2
2

: h :(cid:9) ,

(2.13)

where  is the coupling constant (see below for its relation to newtons constant).
to simplify the notation, the trace of the graviton eld is written as h = h

and all lorentz indices of the elds are written as superscripts whereas the
derivatives acting on the elds are written as subscripts. all indices occurring
twice are contracted by the minkowski metric  . we skip the space-time
dependence if the meaning is clear.

the presence of the b-tensor in eq. (2.13) is a consequence of the choice of

the graviton variable (see sec. 2.3).

2.3 perturbative gauge invariance

the classical gauge properties of h (x) (which are related to the general co-
variance of the metric g (x) under coordinate transformations [17], [18]) are
formulated at the quantum level by the gauge charge [10], [11]

q := zx0=const

d3x h (x),


0
x u(x) .

(2.14)

for the construction of the physical subspace and in order to prove unitarity of
the s-matrix on the physical subspace [13], the ghost eld u(x), together with
the anti-ghost eld u(x), have to be quantized as free fermionic vector elds:

u(x) = 0 , u(x) = 0 ,

whereas all other anti-commutators vanish. the gauge charge generates the
following innitesimal operator gauge variations

(cid:8)u(x), u (y)(cid:9) = i  d0(x  y) ,

(2.15)

dqu(x) :=(cid:8)q, u(x)(cid:9) = 0 ,

dqh (x) :=(cid:2)q, h (x)(cid:3) = i bu(x), ,

dq u(x) :=(cid:8)q, u(x)(cid:9) = i h (x), .

gauge invariance of the s-matrix means formally

lim
g1

dqs(g) = 0 .

(2.16)

(2.17)

this condition can be reformulated in terms on the n-point distributions tn:
using eq. (2.1), we see that the condition of perturbative gauge invariance to
n-th order

dqtn(x1, . . . , xn) = sum of divergences ,

(2.18)

implies eq. (2.17), because divergences do not contribute in the adiabatic limit
g  1 due to partial integration and gauss theorem.
using a simplied notation which keeps track of the eld type only, per-
turbative invariance to rst order in pure qg [10], namely for a coupling of
the form t h
1 : hhh : without matter elds, requires the introduction of the
ghost coupling t u
1 + t u
(x). here,
t  h+u
1/1 : uhh : + : uuu : is the so-called q-vertex.

because of t 
1/1 (x) is the matter q-vertex. the concept of q-vertex
allows us to formulate in a precise way the condition (2.18) of perturbative gauge
invariance to the n-th order:

dqtn(x1, . . . , xn) =

n

xl=1


x
l

t 
n/l(x1, . . . , xl, . . . , xn) ,

(2.20)

where t 
n/l is the renormalized time-ordered product, obtained according to the
inductive causal scheme, with one q-vertex at xl, while all other n  1 vertices
are ordinary t1-vertices.
the procedure outlined here corresponds to the expansion of the hilbert

einstein and matter lagrangian density [2], [3], [5]

coupling constant  according to the metric decomposition

g := g g =  +  h ,

(2.22)

which denes the graviton eld h in the minkowski background. then one
obtains

leh + lm =

eh + l(j)

(2.23)

from l(0)
presence of the b-tensor is made clear [13].

the rst order graviton coupling t h

1 (x) : hhh :, corresponds then to the
normally ordered product of il(1)
eh (see [11] for a derivation based merely on
the principle of perturbative operator gauge invariance) and l(2)
eh  hhhh rep-
resents the quartic graviton coupling required by perturbative gauge invariance
to second order in the tree graph sector [10].

the expansion of the matter lagrangian density reads

from the rst term one obtains (2.6) and the matter coupling of eq. (2.13)

agrees with l(2)

2.4 identities for the two-point functions from perturbative

gauge invariance to second order

from the structure of t m
1 it is evident that the two-point distribution describing
loop graphs has the form (up to non-contributing divergences for the matter self-
energy, see sec. 4.1):
t2(x, y)loops =: h(x)h (y) : i (x  y) + : (x)(y) : i (x  y) .
here, the rst term represents the matter loop graviton self-energy and the
second term the scalar matter self-energy. the c-number distributions (x 
y) and (x  y) will be explicitly calculated in sec. 3.3 and in sec. 4.2,
respectively.
perturbative gauge invariance to second order, namely eq. (2.20) with n = 2,
allows us to derive a set of identities for these numerical distributions by compar-
ing distributions attached to the same operators on both sides of eq. (2.20), [19].
we compute dqt2(x, y)loops by means of (2.16) and isolate the contributions

(2.25)

with external operator of the type : u(x)h(y) :. we obtain

dqt2(x, y)loops(cid:12)(cid:12):u(x)h(y): =: u(x),h (y) : (cid:0)b (x  y)(cid:1) .

on the other side, t 
2/1(x, y) has to be constructed with one q-vertex at x and
one normal vertex at y. from the structure of both interaction terms, it follows
that the loop contributions coming from t 

2/1(x, y) can only be of the form

(2.26)

t 
2/1(x, y) =: u(x)h (y) : t

uh(x  y) + : u(x)h (y) : tuh(x  y) , (2.27)
by performing two matter eld contractions. the second term t 
2/2(x, y) does
not contain terms with wick monomials of the type : u(x)h(y) :. applying x

to the expression above we nd

x
t 

2/1(x, y) =+ : u(x),h (y) : (cid:8)t
uh(x  y) +  
(cid:8)t
uh(x  y) +  

+ : u(x)h (y) : x

 tuh(x  y)(cid:9) +
 tuh(x  y)(cid:9) .

we compare the c-number distributions in (2.26) and in (2.28) attached to

(2.28)

the external operators

: u(x),h (y) :

and

: u(x)h (y) : .

(2.29)

therefore, we obtain two identities

0 = x

b (x  y) =(cid:8)t
uh(x  y)
(cid:8)t
 (x  y) = 0 .

 +  tuh(x  y)(cid:9) ,
 +  tuh(x  y)(cid:9) .

uh(x  y)

 to the rst identity and inserting the second one, we obtain

by applying x

(2.30)

(2.31)

this identity for the matter loop graviton self-energy tensor has been explicitly
checked and implies the gravitational slavnovward identities for the two-point
connected green function (see sec. 3.3).

gauge invariance to second order in the tree graph sector is much more
involved and requires also the full analysis of the matter-graviton interaction,
see sec. 5.

3 matter loop graviton self-energy

3.1 causal d2(x, y)-distribution

in order to construct d2(x, y), according to sec. 2.1, we rst need the contrac-
tions between eld operators. from (2.8) and (2.11), we derive them:

c(cid:8)(x)(y)(cid:9) :=(cid:2)(x)(), (y)(+)(cid:3) = i d(+)

m (x  y) ,
c(cid:8)h(x) h (y)(cid:9) :=(cid:2)h(x)(), h (y)(+)(cid:3) = i b d(+)
where () refers to the positive/negative frequency part of the corresponding
quantity.

3.2 distribution splitting and uv finiteness for the matter

loop

we turn now to the splitting of the d2-distribution of eq. (3.12). the leading
singular order is four because the polynomials are of degree four in p. but,
since these polynomials act in conguration space as derivatives, the essential
structure of the distributions is given by the scalar part. therefore, neglecting
the polynomials, the rst, the second and the third term in (3.12) has singular
order 0, 2 and 4, respectively, due to the inverse powers of p. when discussing
the normalization n2(x, y), we will realize that this was the correct choice.
as anticipated in sec. 2.1, a retarded part of d2 is obtained in momentum

space by the integral [8]:

rc(p0) =

i

p+1
0

dk0

d(k0)

(k0  i0)+1(p0  k0 + i0)

,

(3.18)

for p = (p0, 0), p0 > 0. this retarded part is the so-called central splitting
solution, because the subtraction point is the origin.

the behaviour of the rst term in (3.12) is dictated by a scalar distribution

of the form

d(k)(1) =r1 

4m2
k2 (k2  4m2) sgn(k0) =: f (k2) sgn(k0) .

(3.19)

therefore, we have to split d(k) with ( d) = 0, because d(k0)  constant for
|k0|   and k = (k0, 0)  v +. from (3.18) we obtain

(3.23)

the t2(x, y)-distribution is obtained from the retarded part r2(x, y) by sub-
tracting r
2(x, y). this subtraction aects only the numerical distributions.
therefore, subtracting

r(p0) = s1 

4m2
p2

(p2

(3.24)

from (3.23), we obtain the numerical t-distribution belonging to t2(x, y):

t(p) =

q

ds ps(s  q)
s2(1  s + i0)

=:

(p2) .

(3.27)

note that we write for simplicity the p-dependence instead of the q-dependence
of the basic integral  that remains to be calculated. therefore, the splitting of
the rst term in (3.12) and the subtraction of r(p)(1)

 yields

t(p)(1)

 = i  p (p) (p2) .

(3.28)

14

here,  := /(2) = 2/(960(2)5).

following the same steps as from eq. (3.20) to eq. (3.28), we nd for the

second term in (3.12)

t(p)(2)

 = i 

m2
p2

q(p) (p2) ,

because in d(p)(2)

 = m2  q(p) d(p)(2), the scalar part reads

d(p)(2) =

1

p2s1 

4m2
p2 (p2  4m2) sgn(p0) .

analogously, for the third term of (3.12) we obtain

t(p)(3)

 = i 

m4
p4

r(p) j(p2) ,

because in d(p)(3)

 = m4  r(p) d(p)(3), the scalar part reads

d(p)(3) =

p2 (p2  4m2) sgn(p0) ,

j(p2) :=z

(3.33)

the dierence between j(p2) and (p2) lies in the powers of s in the denomina-
tors in eqs. (3.27) and (3.33). this is a consequence of splitting these distribu-
tions according to the singular orders of the corresponding scalar distributions.
the two integrals (p2) and j(p2) have the same structure and the last can
be expressed by means of the rst. we decompose (p2) into real and imaginary
part

(p2) = pz 

q

dsps(s  q)
s2(1  s)  i p1  q (1  q) ,

(3.34)

a look at eqs. (3.35) and (3.36) enables us to isolate in the expression for jr(p2)
the terms appearing also in (3.35). the others can be easily integrated and we
obtain

jr(p2) =

2
3q

+ r(p2) =

p2
6m2 + r(p2) ,

(3.37)

the imaginary parts have always the same form as in eq. (3.34). gathering
the results in (3.28), (3.29) and (3.31) with (3.37) we can write the distribution
describing the matter loop graviton self-energy:

t2(p)gse

q(p) +

m4
p4

r(p )o (p2) +

(3.38)

m2
6p2

r(p)(cid:21) .

therefore, the 2-point operator-valued distribution t2(x, y) for the graviton self-
energy reads
t2(x, y)gse =: h(x)h (y) : t2(x  y)gse

 =: h(x)h (y) : i (x  y) ,
(3.39)

where (x y) is the graviton self-energy tensor. its fourier representation
is given by i(3.38).
we still must calculate explicitly the integral representation for (p2), (3.27).
there are three dierent regimes, depending on the value of q. for q = 1, namely
p2 = 4m2, we obtain by means of the partial decomposition (3.35):

a(p2 = 4m2) = 2z 

1

dx

1
x2 = 2 .

(3.40)

for q < 1, namely p2 > 4m2, the integration of the partial decomposition (3.35),
taking into account also the imaginary part from (3.34), yields

b(p2) = 2 +p1  q log(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

q  1  1  q

q  1 + 1  q(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)  i p1  q (1  q) .

16

(3.41)

for q > 1, namely 0 < p2 < 4m2, the integration of (3.34) gives

c(p2) = 2 + 2pq  1 (cid:18) 

2  arctan

= 2 + 2pq  1 arctan(cid:18) 1

q  1(cid:19)
q  1
q  1(cid:19) .

note that these three results are connected by

c(p2) = a(p2 = 4m2) .

(3.44)

two limits of this result will be used in the discussion of the normalization
n2 of the t2-distribution, sec. 3.4: the limit of (p2) for p2  0 and the limit
of (p2)/p2 for p2  0, too. in the rst case we have

(3.47)

summing up the whole calculation, we have found the 2-point distribu-
tion (3.39) for the graviton self-energy contribution. the corresponding ten-
sor, the structure given by (3.38) and the integral in (3.44), is uv nite and
cuto-free.

during the calculation, we never resorted to an ad-hoc regularization of the
expressions (for example dimensional regularization as in [3]). this was made
possible by using the correct starting point, namely eq. (3.18), which is, so to
say, a careful multiplication by a step-function in the time argument. if this
had been done naively, then it would have corresponded to the choice  = 1
in (3.18), when splitting the rst term of eq. (3.12), a choice which is manifestly
wrong, being  = 0.

choosing  = 1 in eq. (3.20), one obtains a uv logarithmic divergence.
for the sake of completeness, we briey report also the results in the case of
massless matter coupling, eq. (3.14), and in the case of non-minimally coupled
massless matter, eq. (3.17).

the splitting of the scalar distribution (p2) sgn(p0) requires some modi-
cations if one tries to use the splitting formula (3.18), see [9], [14]. the retarded

part is given by (i/2) log(cid:0)(p2  i p00)/m 2(cid:1), so that the m = 0 matter self-

energy tensor reads

(p)m=0

m 2 (cid:19) ,
 =  p (p) log(cid:18)p2  i0

(3.48)

where m > 0 is a scale invariance breaking normalization constant and not a
cuto.

for the non-minimally coupled case we nd analogously

(p)non-min.

this graviton self-energy tensor is traceless:  (p)non-min.
 = 0, because in this
case the graviton is coupled to a traceless matter energy-momentum tensor. the
latter corresponds to the so-called improved energy-momentum tensor [20].

in addition, it is transversal: p (p)non-min.

 = 0. this property follows from
the gauge identity (2.31), namely bp (p) = 0, see sec. 3.3, and from
its vanishing trace.

also in these two cases, we have found uv nite graviton self-energy contri-
butions without introducing counterterms or uv cuto. this is in contrast to
the calculations carried out for massless scalar matter elds coupled to qg in
the background eld method with dimensional regularization [4], [5].

18

3.3 graviton self-energy tensor and perturbative gauge in-

variance

the gauge properties of t2(x, y)gse are contained in the identity bx
y) = 0, see eq. (2.31). this identity implies the conditions

(x 

a  2b = 0 , c + e = 0 , b  2e  2f = 0 ,

(3.50)

for the coecients of the self-energy tensor. these conditions are satised by
our result of eq. (3.9) and therefore (x  y) is gauge invariant. this is
certainly the case at the level of the d2(x, y)gse-distribution, before distribu-
tion splitting.
in the causal scheme, uv niteness and gauge invariance are
established separately. the latter is not used to reach the former. the iden-
tity (2.31) implies the slavnovward identities (swi) for the 2-point connected
green function. the latter is dened as

g(p)[2]

 := b df

0 (p) (p) b df

0 (p) ,

(3.51)

where df
0 (p) = (2)2(p2  i0)1 is the scalar feynman propagator. the
two attached lines represent free graviton feynman propagators. the swi
reads [3], [12]:

p g(p)[2]

 = 0 ,

(3.52)

namely that the 2-point connected green function is transversal. in term of the
coecients a, . . . , f as in eq. (3.8) we have

a  2b = 0 , c + e = 0 ,

a
4

+ c  f = 0 .

(3.53)

these are equivalent to the conditions (3.50). this conclusion is valid also in
the massless case, eqs. (3.48) and (3.49).

in [21], the gauge invariance of the massless matter loop graviton self-energy
tensor is also investigated, but there it is not realized that the correct matter
coupling is the one in eq. (2.13), namely with the b-tensor, when one uses the
goldberg variable expansion. this deciency does not have consequences, if
the graviton is coupled to a traceless matter energy-momentum tensor as in the
non-minimal coupling case, eq. (3.16).

graph sector

(cid:16) : u(x)h (y) :(cid:2)t

has been explicitly checked by calculating also the distributions t
and tuh(x  y) with one q-vertex from eq. (2.27).

uh(x  y)

3.4 reduction of the freedom in the normalization

we turn now to the normalization of the t2-distribution of eq. (3.39). the total
singular order is four because the polynomials are of degree four in p. therefore,
we have to add normalization terms up to the singular order four.

the freedom in the normalization due to the splitting procedure is contained

in the local term n2(x, y)gse:

n2(x, y)gse =: h(x)h (y) : i n (x, y) (4)(x  y) .

(3.55)

from (2.5), we can write in momentum space this normalization as a sum of
polynomials of degree 2i  4 = 

n (p) =

n (p)(2i)

 .

2

xi=0

(3.56)

normalization terms with odd  are absent due to parity and lorentz covariance.
gauge invariance bp n (p)(2i)
 = 0, (i = 0, 1, 2) and symmetries reduce the
freedom in the normalization in such a way that the polynomials have to be of
the form

n (p)(0)

 = 0 ,

n (p)(2)

 = (cid:2)0, 0,a, a,a(cid:3) 1

p2 ,

n (p)(4)

 = (cid:2)4(b + c), 2(b + c),b, b, c(cid:3) ,

(3.57)

in the usual representation given by eq. (3.8). the constants a, b, c  r
should be xed by requiring the appropriate mass- and coupling constant-
normalizations for the corrections of order 2 to the graviton propagator. let-
ting formally g  1 in eq. (2.1), we write the order 2 corrected propagator
as

 i d(x  y)[2]

 = i b df

 i(cid:0)(x1  x2) + n (x1  x2)(cid:1)(cid:0)  i b df

in momentum space, this becomes

yields also a = 0. decisive is the compensation between the rst two terms
in (3.66) and (3.67). this is due to the presence of the term m2
r(p) in
6p2
eq. (3.38).

a remark about the splitting:

if we had split the distributions d2(p)(i)

 ,
i = 2, 3 in eq. (3.12) according to their true singular orders, namely 2 and
0 (because of the presence of the polynomials), respectively, then the term
m2
r(p) would have been missing from (3.38). working out the conse-
6p2
quences for what concerns the normalization question, eq. (3.66) would have
required the choice a = 8m2/3, whereas eq. (3.67) the choice a = 4m2/3. this
would have meant the impossibility of a consistent normalization. therefore,
the splitting, as carried out in sec. 3.2, is justied.

the origin of the above mentioned problem lies in the fact that the central
splitting solution (3.18) is not applicable in that case and one has to choose a
subtraction point dierent from the origin.

the remaining constants b and c are not xed by these requirements. the
total graviton self-energy tensor including its normalization has then the form

elements in the two-dimensional space of gauge invariant polynomials of degree
four. they can be chosen to be: z(p)(1)
 =
[4, 2, 0, 0, 1].

 = [4, 2,1, 1, 0] and z(p)(2)

analysis of the issue of normalization with the method used in [14], [15]

leads to the same conclusions.

4 matter self-energy

the 2-point distribution describing the matter self-energy graph is not interest-
ing from the point of view of its gauge properties. however, the calculation of
the corresponding distribution is carried out to show its uv niteness.

22

4.1 causal d2(x, y)-distribution and distribution splitting

the d2-distribution is here obtained by performing one matter eld contraction
and one graviton contraction (3.1). the result reads:

2

d2(x, y)mse =+ : (x),(y), : nh 2m2
(cid:0)c (+)
|  c ()
+ : (x)(y), : nh2m2
(cid:0)c (+)

+ : (x),(y) : nh 2m2
(cid:0)c (+)
|  c ()
+ : (x)(y) : nh  2m4(cid:0)c (+)
|  c ()

| (cid:1)(x  y)i =: da(x  y)o
|(cid:1)(x  y)i =: db(x  y)o
|(cid:1)(x  y)i =: dc(x  y)o
| (cid:1)(x  y)i =: dd(x  y)o(4.1)

where the c ()

... -functions are dened by

| (x) := d()
c ()
| (x) := d()
c ()

0 (x)  d()
0 (x)  x
d()

m (x) ,

m (x) .

(4.2)

these products are calculated in momentum space, see app. 2, so that the
distributions di, i = a, b, c, d read
da(p) = 2m2
8(2)4 (cid:18)1 

p4 (cid:19) p (p2  m2) sgn(p0) =  dc(p) ,

dd(p) =

m2

(4.3)

from power-counting arguments, one could expect that da behaves as p2 for large
momenta. this is not the case, because the wave equation ( + m2)d()
m (x) = 0
lowers the power of p coming from the product of contractions.
in order to
shorten the calculation, we bring d2(x, y)mse into the form

d2(x, y)mse =: (x)(y) : d2(x  y)mse + divergences ,

(4.4)

with

d2(p)mse = + p2 da(p)  i p db(p) + i p dc(p) + dd(p)

truly, this simplication can only be made for the corresponding t2-distribution,
because divergences do not contribute in the adiabatic limit g  1 of eq. (2.1).

23

therefore, one should split the four distributions di, i = a, b, c, d separately and
then recast the tis in a form similar to eq. (4.4) for the t2-distribution. the
nal result would be the same. note that in the m = 0 case, d2(x, y)mse = 0.

4.2 matter self-energy two-point distribution and freedom in

its normalization

from (4.4) with (4.11) and (4.14), we can derive the 2-point distribution for the
matter self-energy

t2(x, y)mse =: (x)(y) : i (x  y) ,

(4.16)

the obtained loop contribution is uv nite and cuto-free due to the causal
scheme.

this loop contribution was also calculated in [22] within the operator regular-
ization scheme. parts of their result agree with our expression in (4.16), whereas
dierences concern the explicit presence of parameters, of other p-dependent log-
arithms and terms which go as p4 in their expression for (p). in the causal
scheme, these latter cannot appear, because the singular order remains the same
after distribution splitting.

the retarded part in (4.9) is the boundary value of the analytic function of

considered: letting formally g  1, they are of the form

for the remaining constant c2, we cannot provide here a value. a restriction
should come from the vertex corrections (p, q) to third order in the 3-point
distribution t3(x, y, z) =: (x)(y)h (z) : (x, y, z) .

5 perturbative gauge invariance to second order in

the tree graph sector

in this section we show that the condition of perturbative gauge invariance to
second order in the tree graph sector generates a local quartic interaction of the
form  2 : hh : (4)(x  y), which agrees with the second order l(2)
m in the
expansion of the matter lagrangian density lm , eq. (2.24).

26

5.1 methodology

since r
2(x, y) is trivially gauge invariant due to its denition and to the gauge
invariance of t1(x), instead of eq. (2.20) for n = 2, we have to examine whether

dqr2(x, y) + dqn2(x, y) = x

 r

2/1(x, y) + y
+ x

 r
 n 

2/2(x, y) +
2/1(x, y) + y

 n 

2/2(x, y)

(5.1)

can be satised by a suitable choice of the free constants in the normalization
terms n2, n 
and r
constructed distributions

2/1
2/2 are the retarded distributions obtained by splitting the inductively

2/2 of the retarded parts r2, r

2/2. here, r

2/1 and n 

2/1 and r

d

2/1(x, y) :=(cid:2)t 

1/1(x), t1(y)(cid:3)

and d

2/2(x, y) :=(cid:2)t1(x), t 

1/1(y)(cid:3) .

this procedure has been described in [10] for pure qg. it turned out that
eq. (5.1) can be spoiled by terms with point support  (4)(x  y), only. n2,
n 
2/1 and n 
2/2 are by denition local terms, but there is another source of local
anomalies, namely the splitting procedure for tree graphs:
in the inductive
construction of r
1/1 can give rise to expressions of the form

2/1, the q-vertex t 

(5.2)

d
2/1(x, y) =:o(x, y) : 

x dm(x  y) .

(5.3)

:o(x, y) : is a normally ordered product of four elds, being the other two elds
in the commutator (5.2). m can also be zero, if the commutator contains two
graviton elds. the retarded part is simply

r
2/1(x, y) =:o(x, y) : 

x dret

m (x  y) ,

(5.4)

because the trivial splitting for tree graphs follows from dm = dret
m with
the correct support properties as explained in sec. 2.1. applying the derivative
x
 , which forms the divergence in x

m  dav

2/1, we get

 r

:o(x, y) : xdret

m (x  y) =:o(x, y) : (cid:2)(4)(x  y)  m2 dret
m (cid:3) .

the expression :o(x, y) : (4)(x  y) is a local anomaly. a corresponding mech-
anism works also for r
we dene by an(x

2/2) the set of all local anomalies generated

2/1 + y

2/2.
 r

 r

(5.5)

by the described mechanism.

following [10], gauge invariance is preserved if we can choose n2, n

n 

2/2 so that the condition

27

note that in qg coupled to matter dqr2 does not generate local terms with
matter elds involved, namely of the type : uh :. this is in contrast to the
much more involved pure qg case.

at this point we realize that it is not sucient to consider t m

1 only. also the
graviton and ghost rst order couplings t h
1 have to be taken into account,
because they yield also local anomalies with external operators : uh : when
splitting the commutators of (5.2).
using a simplied notation which keeps track of the structure of the coupling

1 and t u

only, gauge invariance to rst order then becomes

+(cid:2) :{u} :, : uhu :(cid:3) +(cid:2) :{u} :, : h :(cid:3) .

in the pure qg sector, which involves terms of the type : uhhh : and : uuuh :,
perturbative gauge invariance has been shown in [10].

(5.8)

5.2 explicit calculations

our task consists in the investigation of the three remaining sectors in eq. (5.8)
in which matter and graviton elds are mixed together. we denote the three
commutators in (5.8) as the graviton-, ghost-, and matter sector, respectively.

performing one contraction they lead to

d h

d u

2/1(x, y) =(cid:0) : uh

(5.9)

respectively. by considering the explicit form of t u
we nd that no local anomalies arise in the ghost sector.

1 in [10] and t  m

1/1 in (2.19),

let us compute the local anomalies in the graviton sector. from the ex-
in [10] we isolate the terms that generate local anomalies

pression for t  h+u

(5.11)

the rst two elds in the normally ordered products depend on x, whereas the
matter elds depend on y. the retarded part r h
2/1 has exactly the same form
0 . applying x
as in (5.11) with the replacement d0  dret
2/1 (5.11), we
obtain the local anomalies (local anomalies coming from y
2/2 are just the
same, therefore we get a factor two):

(5.12)

because of the -function, all elds have now the same space-time dependence.
in the matter sector, the rst term in the matter q-vertex of eq. (2.19) is
the only one that can generate local anomalies, because it carries the -index
as a derivative. then, d m

5.3 quartic normalization terms

summing up, we have found all the local anomalies arising from x
2/2
attached to normally ordered products of the type : uh :. these can be
organized in three dierent types according to their lorentz structure apart
from derivatives: type i : uh : with derivatives , , ; type ii : uh :
with derivatives , ,  and type iii : uh : with derivatives , , .
dierent lorentz types do not interfere.

according to eq. (5.6), the question is whether these local anomalies can

local divergence terms coming from x

reach such a compensation, normalization terms on the left side of (5.6) have to
be introduced in order to preserve gauge invariance.

the local anomalies of type i can be indeed written as a divergence:

2/2, eq. (5.6) restricted to the lorentz type i and ii holds.

therefore, by choosing the appropriate local divergence normalization terms
x
 n 

2/1 + y
the local anomaly of type iii, eq. (5.18) cannot be written as a divergence.
eq. (5.6) forces us to consider normalization terms n2. then, we require that
the local anomaly of type iii has to be coboundary, namely a gauge variation
of a normalization term n2:
2m2

dqn2(x, y) =

: u(x),h(x)(x)(x) : (4)(x  y) .

the only possible n2 that satises this requirement is

(5.22)

(5.23)

n2(x, y) =

i2m2

n : hh : 

1

: hh :o (4)(x  y) .

taking the factor 1
2 for the second order s-matrix expansion (2.1) into account,
the quartic interaction in (5.23), quadratic in , generated by gauge invariance
agrees exactly with the term of order 2 in the expansion of the matter la-
grangian density lm in (2.24). but in our case, this mechanism of generation
works in a purely quantum framework.
the only objection to this result is that this n2 is not a proper normaliza-
tion of a tree graph in t2, obtained starting with t h+u
1 . but it can be
considered as a normalization term of box-graphs in fourth order with external
legs : hh : constructed with two t h+u

namely, the matter q-vertex of (2.19) in the m  0 limit. performing the same
calculation as for the massive case, it turns out that the local anomalies are those
of type i only, eq. (5.16) which can be written as a divergence and therefore
compensated by proper normalization terms x
2/2 as in (5.20). from
eq. (5.6), it follows that dqn2 = 0, which is certainly satised by n2 = 0. this
agrees with the fact that even classically there are no hh couplings in the
m = 0 case: the expansion of lm written in terms of the goldberg variable
reads
