integration uctuations dierent momenta. eective action given describes eective dynamics excitations wavelenghts exceeding 1. low-energy eective action arises limit 0, nite number excitations (the zero-modes massless elds) remain relevant. course, dierent theories possess low-energy action (e.g. theories without massless particles degrees freedom, surviving low-energy approximation, low-energy eective action zero them): actions pertinent universality classes rather particular eld theory models. usual study universality classes instructive look simplest representative given class. matrix integrals, (0+0)-dimensional models simplest representatives class, also contains 2d topological sigma-models interacting 2d gravity. similarly, seiberg-witten conjecture interpreted n = 2 susy yang-mills models belong universality class, simplest representatives (0+1)-dimensional integrable systems. natural hypothesis (suggested ) interpretation low- energy eective actions terms -functions states that: - low-energy eective actions quasiclassical (whitham) -functions. - proper coordinates (the structure) moduli space vacua provided adiabatic invariants (ac = hc ~pd~q). - time-variables, associated low-energy correlators (i.e. renor- malized coupling constants) whitham times (the deformations sym- plectic structure). seiberg-witten theory provides us two kinds pieces evi- dence
