abstract

starting with the ordinary ten-dimensional supersymmetric yang-
mills theory for the gauge group u(n), we obtain a twelve-dimensional
supersymmetric gauge theory as the large n limit. the two symplec-
tic canonical coordinates parametrizing the unitary n  n matrices
for u(n) are identied with the extra coordinates in twelve dimen-
sions in the n   limit. applying further a strong/weak duality, we
get the decompactied twelve-dimensional theory. the resulting twelve-
dimensional theory has peculiar gauge symmetry which is compatible also
with supersymmetry. we also establish a corresponding new superspace
formulation with the extra coordinates. by performing a dimensional
reduction from twelve dimensions directly into three dimensions, we see
that the poisson bracket terms which are needed for identication with
supermembrane action arises naturally. this result indicates an universal
duality mechanism that the t hooft limit of an arbitrary supersymmetric
theory promotes the original supersymmetric theory in (d  1, 1) di-
mensions into a theory in (d, 2) dimensions with an additional pair of
space-time coordinates. this also indicates interesting dualities between
supermembrane theory, type iia superstring with d0 -branes, and the
recently-discovered twelve-dimensional supersymmetric theories.

1. introduction

there has been accumulating evidence that u(n) matrix theory [1] in the large n limit
[2] corresponds to the strongly coupled type iia superstring [3], and therefore to the m-
theory [4][5]. for example, we can explicitly compute the supergraviton eective potential
that agrees with the that of eleven-dimensional (11d)2 supergravity theory [6].

in the n   limit of an u(n) yang-mills (ym) theory, the commutators for
n  n matrices z and w are replaced by the poisson bracket {z, w }p  (pz)(qw ) 
(qz)(pw ) where p and q are commuting variables in the large n limit, which were
originally non-commuting variables, satisfying q, p = 2i/n. it has been also conjectured
[7] that the large n limit of u(n) ym theories with 16 supercharges are related to certain
supergravity solutions. these recent developments indicate an universal mechanism relating
a supersymmetric theory in (d  1, 1) dimensions with (d, 2) dimensions involving two
extra coordinates p and q, replacing all the non-abelian commutators by the poisson
brackets in (d, 2) dimensions. our formulation is in a sense similar to the formulation in
[8] for supermembrane action, in the sense that the poisson bracket terms are identied with
the large n limit of u(n) supersymmetric ym theory.

in this paper, we study if the mechanism as above works even in the case of 10d su-
persymmetric u(n) ym theory in the n   limit, with all the non-abelian group
commutators replaced by the poisson brackets with respect to the extra coordinates in 12d.
interestingly, we will nd that the resulting 12d theory has a peculiar gauge symmetry,
which is also consistent with 12d supersymmetry, similar to a previous formulation of 12d
supersymmetric ym theory [9]. our formulation here is similar to that in [10], in which
sp(2, ir) symmetry for the position/momentum is treated as a local symmetry embedded
in so(d, 2). however, our formulation is also dierent in the sense that we do not deal
with point particle action with bi-local elds, and sp(2, ir)
is not gauged, either. after
establishing the n   action, we perform a dimensional reduction of our 12d theory
into 3d, in order to compare the result with the supermembrane action. as desired, we see
that the resulting action agrees with the action obtained by n   limit of the d0 -brane
action in 1d [1], and therefore, it coincides with the supermembrane action in 3d.

2. canonical variables p and q and large n limit

we rst review the parametrization of u(n) n  n matrices in terms of canonical
variables p and q [11][12][1], and its eect on the commutators in the large n limit [2].

2we use 11d or d = 11 for eleven dimensions, when the signatures are not crucial. to specify the

signatures, we use (s, t) for s positive space and t negative time signatures.

any n n complex matrix z can be expanded in terms of two unitary n n matrices

u and v , satisfying

u n = i ,

v n = i ,

uv = e2i/n v u ,

u = eip ,

v = eiq

eq. (2.1) implies that the eigenvalues of p and q can be chosen to be  ,  (n 
1)/n,  (n  2)/n,

   ,  /n, 0, /n, 2/n,

   , (n  1)/n.3

in the large n limit [2], p and q become mutually commuting c -numbers, as (2.1b)
shows. moreover, the eigenvalues of p and q become continuous taking all the real values
in    p < ,    q < , behaving like a pair of coordinates for a phase space
[11][12][1]. in such a limit, the z in (2.2) becomes just an ordinary fourier expansion in
terms of p and q, which we call z(p, q):

accordingly, we have4

eq. (2.4b) implies that an u(n) commutator can become a poisson bracket in the large
n limit. note that due to the symplectic feature of these two coordinates, it is natural to
have the indenite signature (+, )
in the (p, q) space, and it is convenient to use the

coordinates (x+, x) (cid:16)(p + q)/2, (p  q)/2(cid:17).

in principle, we can apply this aspect of the large n limit for u(n)

to any ym
theory in any dimensions. for example, after appropriate rescalings by the powers of n,
the u(n) ym eld strength

3we use this convention instead of 0, /n, 2/n,

   , 2(n  1)/n in [1][5] for a later purpose of

f  a,  a, + iga, a ,

(2.5)

decompactication.

4in this paper we use the symbol like ,p to denote the derivative /p. we avoid the usage of  for

/x, because a,+a,

etc., are more compact than (cid:0)+a(cid:1)(cid:0)a(cid:1), in equations like (2.6).

3

in (d  1, 1) dimensions with the coordinates (x0, x1,    , xd1) can be promoted into the
eld strength

f  a,  a, + g (a,+a,  a,a,+)

,

(2.6)

in the (d, 2) dimensions (x0, x1,    , xd1, x+, x). the constant g in (2.5) is the usual
ym coupling constant. the last term in (2.6) is nothing else than the poisson bracket
replacing the commutator when n is nite. even though (2.6) seems rather unusual with
the last term, we will see shortly how this makes sense as a eld strength, transforming
properly under our gauge transformation. the metric of the resulting (d, 2) dimensions
() = diag. (, +, +,    , +, ) with an additional pair of space-time coordinates,
is
equivalent to the symplectic variables p and q.

the geometrical meaning of this process is clear, from the viewpoint that the two variables
p and q
can be interpreted as coordinates of particles in quantum mechanics [1]. by
adding two additional coordinates to the usual base manifold, the total space-time dimensions
become now two dimensions higher than the original one.5 as in (2.3), the range for the
new variables p, q is to be , ). this restriction of coordinates implies nothing else
than compactication on s1  s1 of the extra dimensions. in order to get decompactied
system with the extra coordinates free of such a restriction, we need to adopt additional
limiting procedure based on strong/weak duality. this can be done as follows. consider the
rescaling of the extra coordinates xd+1 and xd+2 by

yd+1 = rxd+1 ,

yd+2 = rxd+2

(r  yd+1 < r ,  r  yd+2 < r) , (2.7)

and take the limit

r   ,

g  0 with

xed.

(2.8)

eg  r2g

now the eld strength (2.6) stays formally the same, except that the derivatives , are now
with respect to the new coordinates y with the ranges   < yd+1 < ,   <

yd+2 < , and that the coupling constant g is now replaced by eg . in other words, by

taking this particular limit, we can realize the decompactication from (minkowski)10 
s1  s1
into (minkowski)12. in the next section, we apply this prescription to the usual
10d supersymmetric ym theory for the gauge group u(n), to get the decompactied 12d
theory. accordingly, all the eld strengths used from now on are understood to be in terms of
the new decompactied coordinates   < yd+1 < ,   < yd+2 < , and the rescaled

coupling constant eg , even though we use their original symbols like xd+1, xd+2 and g, in

order to simplify the notation.

5the geometrical signicance and consistency with supersymmetry will be more elucidated, when we

reformulate in superspace in a later section.

3. supersymmetric gauge theory in 12d with peculiar gauge symmetry

we rst summarize our result on our 12d supersymmetric gauge theory after the large
n limit and our decompactication limit, which is very similar to [9], but with a peculiar
gauge symmetry arising from the n   limit. as was mentioned, we need two time
directions for promoting 10d supersymmetric ym theory to 12d, due to the two symplectic
variables.

our notation is the same as the component formulation in [13], i.e., our metric is () =
diag. (, +,    , +, +, ), where we use the indices
for the 12d
coordinates, accordingly, our cliord algebra is {, } = +2, with 0129 11 12 = +1,
and 13  01    91112. we use null-vectors [9] dened by

, ,  = 0, 1, , 9, 11, 12

(n) = (0, 0,    , 0, + 12
(m) = (0, 0,    , 0, + 12

,  12
, + 12

(n) = (0, 0,    , 0, + 12
(m) = (0, 0,    , 0, + 12

, + 12
,  12

) ,

) .

(3.1)

we also use  -indices [14][15], for the two extra dimensions in 12d: v  21/2(v(11) v(12)).
it then follows that n+ = m+ = +1, n = m = 0, and therefore

nn = mm = 0 , mn = m+n+ = mn = +1 .

(3.2)

the p, p are our projection operators for the space of extra dimensions, satisfying the
ortho-normality conditions [14]:

2

n/ m/ = 1
2

p  1
pp = +p ,

+ ,

p  1
pp = +p ,

2

m/ n/ = 1

+ ,

pp = pp = 0 ,

p + p = +i ,

(3.3)

with m/  m and n/  n. the symmetry of the  -matrices are such as

(n/ )

= (n/ ) 
 







,

(m/ )

= (m/ ) 
 







,

(p) = (p) ,

(3.4)

where undotted spinorial indices , ,  = 1, 2 are for the negative chiral components, while

2 are for positive chirality.6

 ,  =
the eld content for our 12d theory is

(a, ), where  is a majorana-weyl spinor
satisfying 13 = . our total action in 12d, obtained by the prescription in the last
section, is now

(3.5)

6we follow refs. [9][14] for the dottedness of indices, which is opposite to the usual convention.

5

where our eld strength and covariant derivative are dened by

f  a,  a, + g(a,+a,  a,a,+) ,
d  , + g(a,+,  a,,+) .

(3.6)

since these quantities are understood as the large n limit, there is no hidden index like
adjoint indices in 10d, and there is no need to take the trace in (3.5). as has been mentioned
at the end of section 2, the ranges of the extra coordinates are   < x11 < ,   <
x12 < , after our decompactication limit. therefore there is no dierence about the range
of coordinates between the 10d ones and the extra ones.

the  -derivative terms in (3.6) are identied with the poisson brackets with respect to
the extra coordinates  as a reminiscent of the non-abelian commutators for the adjoint
representation of u(n) in 10d.

our supersymmetry transformation rule is similar to [16] with a slight dierence:

qa = (pn/ ) = (i n/ )
pppf = 1
q = + 1

(3.7a)

(3.7b)

where the indices i, j,  = 0, 1, , 9 are for the purely 10d coordinates. in (3.7a), we have
qa = 0 due to the property of n/ and p.

our 12d system has a peculiar gauge symmetry which is understood as the n   rem-
iniscent of the original 10d system. they are dictated with the innitesimal parameter  by

ga = +, + g(a,+,  a,,+) ,
g = g(,+,  ,,+) .

(3.8)

clearly, the terms with  are the poisson brackets with respect to our extra coordinates
, as the n   limit of the usual u(n)
and
d transform

commutators. accordingly, f

gf = g (,+f,  ,f,+)
g(d) = g[ ,+(d),

 ,(d),+ ]

,

.

(3.9)

these are nothing but the n   limit of the the u(n) commutators in gf =
g, f, g(d) = g, d for a nite n. relevantly, we can conrm the closure
of two gauge transformations (3.8) on a:

1

g, 2

ga = gd(1

,+2
,

 1

,2

,+) ,

(3.10)

6

where d contains again the poisson bracket terms, as in (3.6). from these features, there
seems to be no fundamental problem to interpret f and d as eld strength and
covariant derivatives in our peculiar 12d space-time.

our eld equations for a and  are

djf ij + 2g(,+pin/ ,) = 0 ,
m/ n/ d = 0 .

(3.11)

(3.12)

note that the index  in (3.12) eectively takes only 10d values, due to the property of
n/ and m/ .

we can also easily conrm the closure of two supersymmetries in 12d, which is similar

to [9]. our result is

q(1), q(2) =  +  +  ,

(3.13)

where 
with respective parameters ,  and :

(3.14)

  d .

(3.15)

our action (3.5) is of course invariant under these extra symmetries. as usual, the closure
on  in (3.13) holds only up to the  -eld equation (3.12).

despite of the peculiar property of our gauge symmetry, we can also conrm the bianchi

identity (bi):

df + df  + d f  0 .

(3.16)

here the covariant derivative d contains the poisson bracket term with  -derivatives.
relevantly, the following arbitrary variations for f and d are useful:

f = d(a)  d(a) ,

(d) = d() + g[ (a),+,  (a),

,+ ]

.

(3.17)

needless to say, all of these covariant derivatives contain the  -derivatives. note also that
d
satises the leibnitz rule: d(ab) = (da)b + a(db), enabling us to perform

7

partial integrations under r d12x. using this with (3.17), it is now straightforward to obtain
our eld equations (3.11) and (3.12), and also to conrm the invariance of our total action
qi = 0 under our supersymmetry (3.7). the transformation rule qa = 0 in (3.7) poses
no problem, due to the eective absence of a in our action (3.5).

even though the extra components fi and f+ are eectively absent from our action
(3.5), the system is not reduced to just an innite identical copies of supersymmetric ym
theory in 10d, or a rewriting of the latter in disguise. this is due to the non-trivial poisson
bracket terms in fij which are the non-trivial reminiscent of the non-abelian terms in the
original 10d theory.

one crucial question is whether or not our 12d theory can be lorentz covariant. even
though we still lack a lorentz invariant lagrangian yet, we emphasize as in [16][13] that all
of our eld equations can be made entirely lorentz covariant, by expressing the null-vectors

in terms of two scalars: n  ,, m  e ,, satisfying , = 0, e , = 0, (,)2 =
0, (e ,)2 = 0, , e ,

 = +1 [16][13]. from this viewpoint, our system has another non-
trivial feature, even for lorentz covariance. the possibility of a lorentz invariant lagrangian
is now under study.

4. superspace formulation in 12d

once we have understood the component formulation of our 12d system, the next natural
task is to reformulate this system in superspace. this is done mainly by studying the
geometrical signicance of supercovariant derivatives, and satisfaction of bis for supereld
strength in superspace.

our superspace coordinates are (z a) = (xa, ), where we use the superspace index
convention: a = (a,), b = (b,), , with the bosonic coordinates a, b,  = 0, 1, , 9, +,  and
the fermionic coordinates , ,  = 1, 2, , 32. as usual, our starting point is the super-gauge
covariant derivative, dened in our case by

a  da + g(aa,+d  aa,d+) ,

(4.1)

m m is the usual superspace covariant derivative, while aa,  daa 
where da  ea
aa. we regard the last two terms in (4.1) as a gauge connection term, generating the
poisson bracket terms in the supereld strength, as will be seen. note that only d instead
of  are needed for these terms. now our supereld strength fab is dened by the
commutator as

a, b} = g(fab,+d  fab,d+) ,
fab  daab)  tab

cac + g(aa,+ab,  aa,ab,+) ,

8

(4.2a)

(4.2b)

where the last poisson bracket terms are similar to the component case (2.6), as the reminis-
cent of the commutator of u(n) generators in the large n limit. from the commutator
dening fab, we see the rst signal of the geometric signicance of our formulation. even
though it may be expected in a certain sense, it is remarkable that our new supereld strength
fab satises the bis

the poisson bracket terms as in (4.1). these bis are conrmed by the jacobi identity
a, b}, c)}  0. to specify the components in (4.3), we call it (abc) -type bi.

our next task is to satisfy all the components of the bi (4.3) and (4.4). as usual in

superspace formulations, we postulate a set of constraints:

t

c = (cd)nd + (p)nc = (pcdp)nc

fbc = +(p
b|

n/ |c)  nbc .

(4.5a)

(4.5b)

(4.5c)

(4.5d)

(4.5e)

there is similarity as well as dierence between this superspace formulation and that in
[9][17] or that in [14]. first, (4.5a) is exactly the same as that in [14], in particular with the
p -term. another similarly is that the  -eld is a kind of auxiliary eld, needed for the
(c) -type bi, but it disappears from the nal supereld equations (4.7) and (4.8) below.
the dierence is that the elds  or fab are not subject to any extra constraints, such
as fabnb = 0 [9][17].

the satisfaction of bi (4.4) is rather trivial, due to the non-vanishing component of
c
in (4.5a). the conrmation of the bi (4.3) is as easy as the other 12d cases [9][17], up

t
to some points peculiar to this system. first, the () -type bi is proportional to

(in/ )(|

(i n/ )

|)  0 ,
(c) -type bi is easily shown
conrmed by 12d  -matrix algebra as in [9][13]. the
(bc) -type bi gives (4.5e). at this stage, we can
to be satised due to (4.5c), while
get the  -supereld equation as (())  {, }  0. this  -supereld
equation in turn gives the f -supereld equation by taking its spinorial derivative like

(4.6)

9

(a)( -eld equation) = 0, both in agreement with (3.11) and (3.12). in the present
notation they are

jf ij + 2g

,+ (in/ )
a = 0 .

, = 0 ,

(4.7)

(4.8)

(m/ an/ )

as has been already mentioned, even though the extra components fi and f+ are
absent in (4.7), the poisson bracket terms with extra derivatives
, in these supereld
equations dierentiate our 12d system from merely a rewriting of 10 supersymmetric theory,
or the latter just in disguise.

it is interesting that our newly-dened supereld strength fab reveals so much ge-
ometrical signicance and consistency with supersymmetry, quite parallel to conventional
superspace formulations. this already suggests much deeper physical and geometrical sig-
nicance of the incorporation of the symplectic canonical variables p, q as a part of the
space-time coordinates, forming the total space-time with two time coordinates.

5. dimensional reduction into 3d

as an important test of our 12d theory, we perform a dimensional reduction into 3d,
and see if the resulting action coincides with the n   limit of d0 -brane action in
1d [1]. this is because the the two canonical symplectic variables p, q parametrizing the
unitary n  n matrices in 1d form additional two extra coordinates, promoting it to a 3d
theory, compatible with the action (hamiltonian) [11] of supermembrane [18].

our dimensional reduction prescription is the usual one, namely we require all the elds
to be independent of the internal 9d coordinates x1, x2,
   , x9, so that the space-integrals
over these coordinates in the action become an over-all trivial factor. only in this section
we use hats on elds and on indices in 12d in order to distinguish them from those in 3d.
in this notation, our 12d lagrangian (3.5) is rewritten as

i =z d12bx (cid:20)  1

4

(bfij)2 + (bcpbibn/cdib)(cid:21) ,

(5.1)

where i, j , = 0, 1, , 9 are 10d coordinate indices. other components in bf
bfi+ are eectively absent from (5.1), due to the second and third terms in (3.5). all the

12d elds are dimensionally reduced to 3d with the coordinates (x0, x+, x) by the rules,
such as

such as

bfij =( bfij = g(x i

(5.2d)

where i, j,  = 1, , 9 in this section are for the spacial 9d, as those used in [1]. therefore
(0, i) in (5.2c) realize the cliord algebra for 10d. in (5.2),  is a 10d majorana-weyl
spinor with maximally 32 components, and  1,  2,  3 are the usual 2  2 pauli matrices,
and   ( 1i 2)/2. applying the useful relations (5.2) to the action (5.1), and integrating
over the internal 9d coordinates x1,

this lagrangian is still in terms of 10d spinor , which is to be further reduced to 16
component spinors to t the so(9) symmetry we need to compare with the result in [1].
this can be done by the so(9)  -matrix representations [1][5]:

(5.6)

our results (5.5) and (5.6) agree with the 3d result in [11] after the large n limit, up to
non-essential scaling factors such as 2.

we have thus seen that our 12d supersymmetric ym theory directly gives rise to the 3d
theory [11] corresponding to the supermembrane theory [18] after taking the large n limit
in the d0 -brane action.

6. concluding remarks

in this paper we have presented a 12d supersymmetric gauge theory, with a very pecu-
liar gauge symmetry associated with poisson bracket as a reminiscent of the commutators in
non-abelian generators in the original 10d theory. the poisson bracket arises in the t hooft
n   limit for u(n), whose p, q variables are now regarded as two extra coordinates in
the total 12d. the extra coordinates have the ranges   p < ,   q < , implying a
compactication on s1s1 within the total 12d. these extra dimensions are further decom-
pactied by the strong/weak duality by rescaling the coordinates by x11  rp, x12  rq,
and taking the limit r  , g  0 with r2g xed. subsequently, we have also stud-
ied the geometrical signicance in superspace of our supereld strength with the poisson
brackets, and found that a superspace formulation is equally possible like the conventional
supersymmetric ym theory. this superspace formulation elucidates the geometrical signif-
icance of our theory, in terms of eld strength supereld dened by commutators between
super-gauge covariant derivatives, with our peculiar gauge symmetry. we have also stud-
ied the dimensional reduction of our 12d theory into 3d, that yields the desirable poisson
brackets in 3d, corresponding to the action for supermembrane theory [18][11].

in a recent development in the duality between anti-de sitter (ads) and conformal eld
theory [19], it is conjectured that the n = 4, u(n) supersymmetric ym theory in 4d is
dual to type iib theory on (ads)5 s5 in the large n limit. it was pointed out [19] that the
group so(2, 4)so(6) in the n = 4 supersymmetric ym theory suggests a 12d realization
with two time coordinates. in our present paper, we have given a rst explicit example, in
which the direct connection between the supermembrane theory and 10d supersymmetric
ym is much more natural than before. since the n = 4 supersymmetric ym in 4d has the
10d origin which is promoted to be 12d in the large n limit, we have seen another duality
link between superstring theory [3], n = 4 supersymmetric ym in 4d, and supermembrane
theory [18] via 12d supersymmetric ym theory [9].

we have observed similarity as well as dierence between our new superspace formulation
and that in [9][17]. the most conspicuous dierence is the non-vanishing poisson bracket
terms in fab making the system non-trivial. we have also claried the geometrical sig-
nicance of our peculiar eld strength supereld in terms of superspace language. we also
stress that our present paper gives a clearer link between supersymmetric ym theory in 12d
[9][17] and m-theory [4][5].

in a usual non-supersymmetric theory, the loss of lorentz covariance makes the system
completely ambiguous, because we can always put null-vectors anywhere by hand in any
equation in the system. however, as was also stressed in [13][17], this is no longer the case
with supersymmetric theories, in which the coecients in eld equations are tightly xed

12

by supercovariance. the incorporation of symplectic variables as target coordinates makes
stronger sense in supersymmetric theories. our formulation has been also strongly motivated
by the recent development in the matrix theory approach [1] to m-theory [4][5].

in our formulation, due to the absence of supergravity, the loss of local lorentz covariance
in this connection, we mention that only global lorentz covariance plays
is not crucial.
in fact, in the
an important role in the study of non-perturbative aspects of m-theory.
conjecture by maldacena [19] about the duality between the large n limit of d = 4, n =
4 supersymmetric yang-mills and type iib superstring compactied on (ads)5  s5, the
global isometry group is so(4, 2)  so(6), being further promoted to so(10, 2) [19][20],
indicates the existence of 12d supersymmetric theory. note that the so(10, 2) symmetry is
global, and therefore the loss of local lorentz covariance in 12d supergravity/supersymmetry
formulations as in [13] is not crucial in such a formulation of m-theory [4][5].

our result also provides a new link between the f-theory [21] in 12d and the m-theory
[4] in 11d, that has not been explicitly presented before.7 our result also claries general
dualities connecting a supersymmetric ym theory in (d  1, 1) dimensions with another
supersymmetric theory formulated in (d, 2) dimensions under the large n limit. it also
gives a new connection between the conventional supersymmetry/supergravity theories in
d  11 with higher-dimensional theories, such as the 12d supergravity [14][15][13], or more
supersymmetric ym theories in d  12 [17]. in particular, the evidence for the importance
of the results in [9][17] is now rapidly mounting.

we are indebted to i. bars, s.j. gates, jr., j.h. schwarz, and w. siegel for valuable

suggestions.

7in ref. [22], an idea of deleting even the world-line for the d0brane was presented, but with no reference

to the 12d ym eld strength dened with poisson bracket in terms of extra coordinates.
