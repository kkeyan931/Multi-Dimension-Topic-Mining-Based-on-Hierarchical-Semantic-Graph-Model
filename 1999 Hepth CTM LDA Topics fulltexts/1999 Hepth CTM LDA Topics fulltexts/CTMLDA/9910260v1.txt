abstract

via t-duality, a stack of unwrapped type 0 ns5-branes is trans-
formed into a kaluza-klein monopole with an type singularity at its
center. the spectrum of twisted modes at the singularity contains
tachyonic modes. we show that, in certain parameter region, this
tachyonic spectrum is completely reproduced as modes of the bulk
tachyon eld localized on a classical ns5-brane solution. in passing,
we show how twisted modes at the singularity reproduce gauge elds
on stacks of ns5-branes.

1 introduction

ns5-branes are non-perturbative objects in string theory and, unlike the string
itself and d-branes, we cannot directly analyze them by worldsheet cft. they

attract great interest in connection with the mysterious interacting quantum
theory without gravity that they carry on their world volume[1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

the massless spectra on type iia and type iib ns5-branes were rst obtained
in [6]. in that work, it is shown that on an ns5-brane classical solution there are

zero modes of r-r elds representing a vector eld (type iib) or ones representing
a self-dual two-form eld and a scalar eld (type iia). these are not whole spectra
on ns5-branes. by an s-duality argument, we know that u(q) gauge symmetry

is realized on type iib ns5-branes. similarly, in type iia case, it is expected
that the gauge symmetry associated with the tensor multiplet is enhanced into

a non-abelian gauge symmetry. for the present, however, we do not know how
such a theory is described.

type 0a and type 0b theories also contain ns5-branes. by applying the
method of [6], we obtain the following massless spectra. on a type 0b ns5-brane
there are 4 scalar elds representing uctuations and two u(1) gauge elds. on a

type 0a ns5-brane there are four uctuation modes, one unconstrained two-form
eld and two scalar elds. if q type 0 ns5-branes coincide, in imitation of type ii
ns5-branes, we can guess the gauge symmetries to be enhanced into u(q)u(q).
for type 0a ns5-branes, of cause, this statement has just a supercial sense.

there is another way to obtain massless spectra on ns5-branes. via t-duality,
unwrapped ns5-branes are transformed into kaluza-klein monopoles[7]. so, we

can obtain massless spectra on ns5-branes as massless modes on kaluza-klein
monopoles. recently, this method is used to obtain massless spectra on sepa-
rated type 0 ns5-branes[8, 9]. in general, kaluza-klein monopoles have an type
singularities and, in addition to zero modes of bulk elds, we should take account
of twisted modes of strings at the singularities. in section 4, we show that all

cartan part of gauge elds on q coincident ns5-branes are reproduced in this
way. (for type iia and type 0a ns5-branes, we dene the cartan part as the

gauge symmetry which remains when all branes separate from each other.)

as we demonstrate later, the analysis of the twisted modes shows that tachy-

onic elds also exist on type 0 coincident ns5-branes if one transverse direction
is compactied on a suciently small circle. the purpose of this paper is to nd

1

the counterpart of these modes in the supergravity description of the ns5-branes.
if it is possible, they must be modes of the bulk tachyon eld since massless and
massive elds cannot generate tachyonic modes. in section 5, we analyze modes
of the bulk tachyon eld on a ns5-brane classical solution background and show
that the tachyonic spectrum of twisted modes is completely reproduced, at least
in a certain parameter region.

2 t-duality of ns5-branes

in this section, we briey review the t-duality between unwrapped ns5-branes
and kaluza-klein monopoles with keeping our eyes on geometry and symme-
try. first, we discuss familiar t-duality, namely, 0a/0b and iia/iib duality of
unwrapped ns5-branes in s1 compactied string theory. we will mention the
exotic iia/0b and iib/0a duality suggested in [10] at the end of this section.
the following arguments applicable to type iia, iib, 0a and 0b theories. let
us assume ns5-branes extending along x0, . . . , x5 and the x9 direction compacti-
ed on s1 with radius r. these ns5-branes are magnetically coupled to ns-ns
2-form eld bi9 (i = 6, 7, 8). because bi9 is transformed into the metric com-
ponent gi9 by t-duality, the dual to a stack of q ns5-branes is a kaluza-klein
monopole with charge q[7].

the metric of generic parallel kaluza-klein monopoles is given by[11]

ds2 = dxdx + v(xi)(dxi)2 + v1(xi)(dx9 + ai(xi)dxi)2,

(1)

where x ( = 0, . . . , 5) and xi (i = 6, 7, 8) are coordinates of the parallel direc-
tions and the transverse directions, respectively. the coordinate x9 parameterizes

the compactied direction and takes value in 0  x9 < 2er, where er is com-
pactication radius. if we denote the monopole density by mon(xi), a magnetic
potential v(xi) and an electric potential ai(xi)  g9i are obtained by solving the
following dierential equations.

8xi=6  

xi! v(xi) = 2ermon(xi),

ijkjak(xi) = iv(xi).

(2)

when the charge q concentrates at xi = 0, by setting mon(xi) = q3(xi), we
obtain

.

(3)

v(xi) = 1 + erq
2|xi|

2

the rst term on the left hand side of (3). if we introduce a radial coordinate

in a part of this manifold where |xi| is much smaller than erq, we can neglect
r =q2erq|xi| representing the geodesic distance from the point xi = 0, and the

line element d2 on unit s2, (1) is rewritten as

4

er2   dx9

q

+ a  d2!2 ,

(4)

ds2 = dxdx + dr2 +

r2

4 d2

2 +

where ai is the unit charge magnetic monopole gauge conguration on the unit s2
and ai is written as ai = (q/|xi|)ai. the metric (4) represents an orbifold r4/zq
since if the period of x9 were 0  x9 < 2erq, which is q times what it actually

is, it would represent at r4[12]. by moving to a cartesian coordinate, we can
show that the zq is subgroup of one of two su(2) factors of so(4) symmetry
of the divided r4. we will refer to the su(2) containing zq as su(2)l and to
the other as su(2)r. if q  3, su(2)l is broken to u(1) by the zq orbifolding.
let u(1)l denote this symmetry. even if q  2, su(2)l is broken to u(1)l on
the whole manifold described by the metric (1). this u(1)l symmetry represents
a shift of the x9 coordinate. on the other hand, su(2)r represents rotation of
the base r3 parameterized by xi. therefore, the isometry of the kaluza-klein
monopole solution is

where p (1, 5) represents the poincare symmetry on a 1+5-dimentional minkowski

p (1, 5)  su(2)r  u(1),

(5)

space.

the symmetry of ns5-branes in uncompactied ten-dimensional spacetime
is p (1, 5)  so(4). let su(2)1 and su(2)2 denote the two su(2) factors of
this so(4). due to compactication of one transverse direction, so(4) is broken
to so(3)  su(2). we call it su(2)d since it is the diagonal subgroup of
su(2)1  su(2)2. therefore, the symmetry of a ns5-brane conguration in s1
compactied spacetime is

p (1, 5)  su(2)d.

(6)

in the low-lying supergravity level, it is known that s1 compactied type iia the-
ory and type iib theory have the same eective action[13]. because the classical
kaluza-klein monopole solution (1) does not depend on x9, it is also a solution
of nine dimensional supergravity. therefore, by the t-duality of supergravity, we

3

can obtain a solution in nine-dimensional supergravity coupled to bi9 magneti-
cally. this solution is lifted up to ten-dimensional solution independent from x9.
it is called a smeared ns5-brane solution. the symmetry of this solution is

p (1, 5)  su(2)d  u(1)s,

(7)

where u(1)s represent a shift along x9 direction.

let us compare the symmetry of the ns5-brane conguration and the kaluza-
klein monopole conguration. the symmetry p (1, 5)su(2)d of the ns5-branes
is identied with the symmetry p (1, 5) su(2)r on the kaluza-klein monopole
side. because u(1)l and u(1)s factors in (5) and (7) are associated with the
gauge eld g9i, they are transformed by t-duality into non-geometric symmetries
associated with bi9.

finally, we will mention the exotic t-dualities. to relate type 0 theory and
type ii theory by the t-duality, we should introduce non-trivial monodromies
around s1. namely, we need monodromy (1)fr for type 0 theory and (1)fs
for type ii theory, where the operators fr and fs are the right moving world-
sheet fermion number and the spacetime fermion number, respectively[10].
in
what follows, we call a circle with monodromy (1)fs as s1
(fs) and one with
monodromy (1)fr as s1
(fr). via this duality, a stack of q unwrapped ns5-
branes is transformed into a kaluza-klein monopole with charge 2q, rather than
q[9]. the central part of the kaluza-klein monopole is described as an orbifold
r4/z2q. because of the non-trivial monodromy of the s1 cycle, the dividing z2q
is generated by (1)fs  (type ii) or (1)fr (type 0), where  is a generator of
z2q  su(2)l. in what follows, we call them z(fs )
2q (generated by (1)fs ) and
z(fr)
2q (generated by (1)fr). these duality relations between ns5-branes and
kaluza-klein monopoles are summarized in table 1.

3 tachyonic twisted modes

in this section, we give a tachyonic part of the spectrum of twisted modes of
orbifold r4/, where  is one of zn , z(fs )
n . the integer n is equal
to q or 2q depending on the type of t-duality. we need to consider only the

and z(fr)

n

ns-ns sector since other sectors does not contain tachyonic modes.

let us introduce complex coordinates za (a = 1, 2) on the divided r4, which

at the xed point of this orbifold, n  1 twisted modes appear. we label them
as k = 1, . . . , n  1 for each k, za and za satisfy the boundary conditions

za( + 2) = e2ik/n za(),

za( + 2) = e2ik/n za(),

first, we should give the energy and the u(1)l charge of ground state. u(1)l
charge is necessary when we carry out the  projection. for this purpose, we can
use the following -function regularization formulae.

where [[x]] denotes the element of z + x with the smallest absolute value. the
choice between 1/2 for [[1/2]] does not aect the arguments below. using this
formula, we obtain the vacuum energy of each twisted sector as follows.

l0 =: l0 :

(17)

the left moving part of u(1)l charge qu (1)l is dened as one satisfying the
following relations.

[qu (1)l, a] = a,
[qu (1)l, za] = za,

[qu (1)l, a] = a,
[qu (1)l, za] = za.

(18)

such an operator is given by

xm= xa=1,2 

qu (1)l =

m + k/n
regularizing this by (16), we obtain

([[k/n]] < 0).

(20)

namely, the ground state has qu (1)l = 1 depending on the signature of [[k/n]].
for the right moving part, we can get the following result by replacing k in the
result of the left moving part by k:

equ (1)l =( : equ (1)l : 1,
: equ (1)l : +1,

6

([[k/n]] > 0),
([[k/n]] < 0).

(21)

therefore, total u(1)l charge qu (1)l + equ (1)l of the ground state is always zero.

now, we should construct the fock space by exciting the ground state with
oscillators and should impose gso and  projections. the result for each case is

as follows. all results holds for a or b type theories.

type ii on r4/zq

the ground state of type ii theories is gso odd and it should be excited
by at least one fermionic oscillator. if we restrict our attention to the case
with 0 < k/n < 1/2 for simplicity, fermionic oscillators with the smallest
1/2+k/n in the right
moving part. by exciting the ground state with these oscillators, we have
four massless states for each k.

energy are a,1/2+k/n in the left moving part and ea

a,1/2+k/2|0il  eb

1/2+k/2|0ir.

(22)

therefore, there is no tachyonic mode. these massless modes correspond

to blow up moduli parameters of the singularity.

type 0 on r4/zq

in the type 0 theory, in addition to the states obtained in type ii case,

states with opposite fermion numbers are allowed. because we are focusing
on tachyonic states now, the only oscillators we can use are za
k/q in the

left moving part and eza,k/q in the right moving part. (we assume 0 <

k/n < 1/2.) by exciting both vacuums in the left and right moving part
by p oscillators, we obtain

k/q    zap

k/q|0il ezb1,k/q   ezbp ,k/q|0ir.

these states belong to

type ii on r4/z(fs )
2q

in type ii theory on r4/z(fs)
2q , we have the following spectrum. for even
k we have the same spectrum with type ii on r4/z2q and we have no
tachyonic modes. for odd k, we should take account of the dierence
between z2q and z(fs )
2q . in gs formalism, the boundary condition for the
fermion elds s is given as

s( + 2) = ()ku(k)s(),

(26)

where u(k) is a spinor representation of k  su(2)l. the nontrivial mon-
odromy causes the negative sign for odd k. this change of the boundary

condition for the gs fermions corresponds to the reversal of the gso pro-
jection in the nsr formalism. due to this change of the gso projection,
we have the same tachyonic spectrum with type 0 on r4/z2q. therefore,
the tachyonic spectrum of this theory is obtained by replacing q by 2q,
and k by 2k,where k  z + 1/2 in (23) and (25) as follows.

because of the extra factor ()k we have no ns-ns sector for odd k. for
even k, we have the same spectrum with type 0 on r4/z2q before z(fr)
2q
projection. however, these tachyonic states have (1)fr = 1 and are
projected out by z(fr)
2q projection. therefore, this conguration has no
tachyonic spectrum.

8

4 gauge elds on ns5-branes

in the r-r sector, the zero point energy contributions from bosons and fermions
always cancel and ground states always give massless modes. therefore, tachy-
onic modes do not exist. however, it is worth seeing how these twisted modes
reproduce gauge elds on coincident q ns5-branes.

before gso and  projections, ground states of the r-r sector degenerate
and belong to (2l + 2r) (2l + 2r) representation of so(4)  p (1, 5). (now we
are using light-cone formalism.) after the projections, we obtain the following
massless spectrum in each case. in what follows, we assume that 2l and 2r states
have even and odd worldsheet fermion numbers, respectively.

type iia on r4/zq

in type iia theory, gso projection operator is [(1()fl)/2][(1+()fr)/2].
therefore, we obtain massless states belonging to the vector representation
2r  2l = 4vec for each k. on the other hand, a zero-mode of the r-r
3-form eld gives one six-dimensional u(1) vector eld. putting them to-
gether, we have q u(1) gauge elds. these correspond to cartan part of
u(q) gauge eld on type iib ns5-branes.

type iib on r4/zq

in type iib theory, gso projection operator is [(1+()fl)/2][(1+()fr)/2].
therefore, we obtain massless states belongs to 2l 2l = 3l + 1 for each k.
furthermore, zero modes of the r-r 4-form eld and the r-r 2-form eld
also belong to 3l + 1. putting them together, we have q self-dual two-form
gauge elds (3l) and q scalar elds (1). this corresponds to cartan part
of gauge elds on type iia ns5-branes.

type iia on r4/z(fs )
2q

in this case, we have the following spectrum. for even k, we have the same
spectrum with type iia on r4/z2q. namely, we have one u(1) vector
elds for each k. for odd k, due to the change of the gso projection which
we mentioned in the last section, we have a mode in 2l  2r rather than
2r 2l. (the rst and second factors represent left and right moving parts
respectively.) this gives a vector eld again for each k. putting together
them and a zero modes of r-r three form eld, we have 2q u(1) vector

9

elds. these correspond to cartan part of u(q)  u(q) gauge elds on
type 0b ns5-branes.

type iib on r4/z(fs )
2q

for even k, we have same spectrum with type iib on r4/z2q. namely,
we have one self-dual two-form gauge eld and one scalar eld for each k.

for odd k, due to the opposite gso projection, we obtain elds with the
opposite chirality belonging to 2r  2r = 3r + 1. these are an anti-self-
dual two-form eld (3r) and a scalar eld (1). putting together them and
zero modes of r-r self-dual four-form eld and r-r two-form eld, we have
q unconstrained two-form elds and 2q scalar elds. these correspond to

the cartan part of massless gauge elds on type 0a ns5-branes.

type 0a on r4/zq

in type 0a theory, the gso projection operator is (1()fl+fr)/2. there-
fore, we obtain massless states belonging to 2r  2l + 2l  2r = 4vec + 4vec
for each k. putting together them and zero modes of two r-r 3-form elds,
we have 2q u(1) gauge elds. this corresponds to the cartan part of
u(q)  u(q) gauge elds on type 0b ns5-branes.

type 0b on r4/zq

in type 0b theory, the gso projection operator is (1+()fl+fr)/2. there-
fore, we obtain massless states belonging to 2l2l+2r2r = 3l+3r+1+
1 for each k. putting together them and zero modes of the unconstrained

r-r 4-form eld and two r-r 2-form elds, we have q unconstrained two-
form gauge elds (3l + 3r) and 2q scalar elds (1). this corresponds to
the cartan part of the gauge elds on type 0a ns5-branes.

type 0a on r4/z(fr)
2q

due to the change of boundary condition of the left moving fermions by
(1)fr monodromy, there is no r-r sector for odd k. for even k, we have
two u(1) vector elds from each k like type 0a on r4/z2q. however, one of
them are projected out by the z(fr)
2q projection because they have opposite
()fr quantum numbers. similarly, one of zero modes of two r-r three-
form elds is projected out. putting them together, we have q u(1) vector

10

elds. these correspond to the cartan part of u(q) gauge elds on type
iib ns5-branes.

type 0b on r4/z(fr)
2q

we have no r-r sector for odd k. for even k, we have same spectrum
with type 0b on r4/z2q before the z(fr)
2q projection. namely, we have one
unconstrained two-form gauge elds and two scalar elds for each k.
in
addition to them, we have one unconstrained two-form eld as zero mode
of unconstrained r-r four-form eld and two scalar modes as zero modes
of two r-r two-form elds. however, by the z(fr)
2q projection, half of them
are projected out. as a result, we have q self-dual two-form elds and q

scalar elds. these correspond to the cartan part of the massless gauge
elds on type iia ns5-branes.

5 tachyon modes on ns5-brane solution

in section 3, we showed that tachyonic twisted modes arose in type 0 on r4/zq
and type ii on r4/z(fs )
2q , both which are dual to type 0 ns5-branes. what
are counterparts for these tachyonic modes on the ns5-branes side? we show
that these can be reproduced as modes of the bulk tachyon elds localized on a
ns5-brane classical solution.

in order to analyze modes, we need a classical solution of supergravity. the

relevant part of supergravity action is

tachyonic modes obtained in section 3 belong to (p + 1)  (p + 1) repre-
sentation of su(2)d = su(2)l rotation symmetry.
if this is (p + 1, p + 1)
representation of su(2)1  su(2)2, the structure of the spectrum is similar to
that of modes of a scalar eld in so(4) = su(2)1  su(2)2 symmetric potential.
this seems to imply that these modes are localized in the near horizon region
|xi|  r where the eect of compactication can be neglected. however, as we
will show below, this is not true. this degeneracy of spectrum is accidental one
rather than result of some symmetry.

where 3
s is laplacian on unit s3 and 6 is laplacian along x, whose eigenvalue
gives the mass2 of the modes on the vebrane. the eigenfunction of the operator
in the second term in the bracket in the right hand side is rn and its eigenvalue
is s = n(n + 2)/r2
0, the wave function diverges at r  0 or r  .
they represent modes falling into horizon and modes living outside the throat.
if s > 1/r2
0, the wave function can propagate along the throat. the existence of
these mode are connected with the non-vanishing of hawking radiation and that

of absorption cross section for bulk eld[3, 5]. this result implies that tachyon
modes cannot be trapped in the near horizon region. so, we need to consider
modes outside it. if r0  r, the outside of the region (36) is at and modes
cannot be trapped. therefore we assume

r  r0.

(40)

in this case, the region with r  r is described by a smeared ns5-brane solu-
tion. a smeared ns5-brane solution with charge q distributed around the circle

uniformly is specied by the following ns5-brane density.

ns5(xi) =

where m is an integer in the case of s1 compactication and is a half odd integer
in the case of s1
(fr) compactication because the tachyon eld has (1)fr = 1.
via t-duality, m is transformed into wrapping number, and is identied with
k  z in (23) and (25) or k  z + 1/2 in (27) and (28). one might be afraid
that (46) cannot reproduce the twisted mode spectrum because the kaluza-klein
momentum depends on the compactication radius r while the dependence is
absent on the twisted mode side. this, however, is not the case. by rescaling of

radial coordinate

we obtain the r-independent expression

(49)

(50)

this number corresponds to the principal quantum number of a particle in the

coulomb potential and is quantized as we show below.

for the tachyon eld not to diverge at the origin and innity, the function

() should behave like the following way asymptotically.

()  l

(  ).

let us expand the function () as follows.

() =xn

(51)

(52)

then, the dierential equation (49) gives the following relation among the coef-
cients an.

[n(n + 1)  l(l + 1)] an = (n  )an1

(53)

if we put n = l, this equation gives al1 = 0 and it is consistent with the   0
behavior of (). to reproduce r   behavior in (51), only nite number of
coecients an can be non-zero. for this condition to be satised, the following
values are allowed for .

 = l + 1, l + 2, l + 3, . . . .

as a result, we obtain the mass of the mode.

(54)

(55)

if we identify  with p + 1, this result exactly reproduces the tachyonic spectrum
of the twisted modes (25) and (28)!

for xed (= p + 1), all states with l smaller than  are degenerate. there-

fore, multiplicity is

(2p + 1) + (2p  1) +    + 1 = (p + 1)  (p + 1).

(56)

this is completely same with the multiplicity (24) of the twisted modes.

6 discussion

in this paper, we restricted our attention to the tachyonic modes by the following
reason.

 the structure of spectrum of twisted modes is very simple. because many
oscillators contribute to massive states, the massive spectrum is more com-
plicated.

 on classical solution side, the identication of modes is very easy. tachyonic
modes can come from only the tachyon eld. in order to identify massive
twisted modes with modes of bulk elds, we need to analyze their quantum
numbers in more detail.

 because the tachyon eld is a scalar, it is very easy to calculate the eigen

mode on the classical solution.

15

of course, it is an interesting problem to investigate to what extent this corre-
spondence holds. especially, it is important to understand how the gauge elds
on ns5-branes are described in the context of supergravity. however, leaving
technical obstacles, it seems dicult to reproduce all gauge elds obtained as
twisted modes. according to the argument in the ads/cft correspondence,
supergravity modes corresponds only to gauge invariant operator. in fact, in [6],
only the gauge singlet part of gauge elds are obtained as modes of bulk r-r
elds. therefore, classical modes on ns5-brane solutions may be matched o
against gauge singlet twisted modes at orbifold singularity.

in section 5, we used the smeared ns5-brane metric (43) to obtain the discrete

tachyonic modes. the metric (43) is available only in the region

r  r  r
0.

(57)

therefore, analysis of tachyon modes is valid only when the support of the wave
function of the mode is in this region. in the rest of this section, let us discuss
this condition. using (48), the upper bound in (57) is rewritten as

it is known that the following equation holds for a solution of (49)

in the context of the quantum mechanics on the coulomb potential, this implies
that expectation value of the potential energy is proportional to the total energy.
so, we can use p   as a typical value of . then we obtain the following
bound.

(60)

on the other hand, on the kaluza-klein monopole side, we neglect the rst term

in (3) to obtain the orbifold metric (4). this is possible for r2  erq|xi|  er2q2.
the value r2 = |za|2 can be estimated as an expectation value of the following
operator.

(62)

(63)

this is the same as (60).

finally, let us discuss the lower bound in (57). this condition demand the

tachyon modes not to see the localization of ns5-branes.
typical value of  again, the lower bound in (57) is rewritten as

if we use p as the

k
p  1.

(64)

in [16], the relation between a kaluza-klein monopole and a localized ns5-brane
are argued and it is shown that zero modes of ns-ns two-form eld on the kaluza-

klein monopoles, which are also regarded as twisted modes at the singularity,
play an important role. however, in our analysis, we did not take account of
the interactions among twisted sectors. therefore, it is valid only when the

interaction can be neglected. this argument seems consistent with condition
(64) because, roughly speaking, the interaction between the b eld and strings

is proportional to the winding number k and the probability that a string exist
near the singularity becomes smaller when p becomes larger.
