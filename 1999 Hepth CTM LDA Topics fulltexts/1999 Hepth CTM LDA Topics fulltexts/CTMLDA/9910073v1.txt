i. introduction

the topological properties of physics system play important roles in studying some physi-

cal problem. it is well known that the gauge potential(connection) and gauge eld(curvature)

is essential to establish direct relationship between dierential geometry and topological

invariants. the decomposition theory of gauge potential provides a powerful method in

researching some topological properties.

it has been eectively used to study the topo-

logical gauge theory of dislocation and disclinations in condensed matter physics1, the ge-

ometrization of planck constant in terms of the space time defect in general relativity2,3, the

space-time dislocations in the early universe4, and the gauss-bonnet-chern theorem3,5. the

essential feature of the decomposition shows that the gauge potential have inner structure6,1.

generally, the topological characteristics of a manifold are represented by the properties of

a smooth vector eld on it , or in other words, the smooth vector elds carry the topological

information of a manifold, which inspire us to study the decomposition theory of the gauge

potential in terms of the unit vector eld on the manifold.

it is well known that the su(2) gauge theory and the second chern class has been widely

used in discussing many physical problem. such as the magnetic monopole69, the anomaly

in nonlinear -models10. especially the problems on four-manifold11,12, the instantons1315,

the merons16,17, the donsdson theory18, and so on. it urges us to study the decomposition

theory of the su(2) gauge potential and the topological properties on four-manifold.

in this paper, we will establish a general decomposition theory of the su(2) gauge

potential in terms of the unit vector ~n on the compact and oriented 4-dimensional manifold.

and by means of geometric algebra, we can describe the unit vector ~n as an element of

spin(3)19. one can show that the general decomposition formula of su(2) gauge potential

has a global property. the chern density of the principal p (, m, su(2)) will be studied by

using the decomposition formula. one shows that the su(2) chern density takes the form of

the function (cid:16)~(cid:17) . the topological structure of the su(2) chern density can be labeled

by the brouwer degrees and the hopf index. and the further research shows that there exist

2

the crucial cases of branch process in the topological density, when the jacobian d( 

x ) = 0.

we calculate out the dierent branches of the chern density by using the implicit function

theorem. it is pointed out that the topological charges will be splitted at the critical points.

this paper is arranged in ve sections. in section 2 we will study a general decomposition

theory of su(2) gauge potential on a sphere bundle. in section 3 we will study the topological

structure of the su(2) chern density by using the decomposition expression given in section

2. the bifurcation of the chern density will be studied in section 4. then there will be a

conclusion at last.

ii. the decomposition theory of su (2 ) gauge potential

in this section we will give the decomposition theory of su(2) gauge potential in terms

of the sphere bundle on a compact and oriented 4-dimensional manifold. firstly we have to

give the basic notions which are necessary for our discussions.

let v be a unit su(2) cliord vector

and

v = v aa ,

a = 1, 2, 3 ;

v av a = 1.

in which a are pauli matrixes, and the base of su(2) cliord algebra20.

the covariant derivative 1-form of v is given by

dv = dv  [a, v ]

where a is the su(2) gauge potential 1-form:

and

a = i/2aaa ,

3

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

aa = aa

dx

 = 0, 1, 2, 3.

in gauge theory, the potential 1-form undergoes the gauge transformation:

a = sas1 + dss1.

(5)

(6)

in our viewpoint6, the gauge potential 1-form a can be decomposed and has inner struc-

ture. the main feature of the decomposition theory of the gauge potential is that the gauge

potential a can be generally decomposed as

a = a + b,

(7)

where a and b are required to satisfy the gauge transformation and vector covariant trans-

formation rules, i.e.,19

and

a = sas1 + dss1,

b = sbs1.

(8)

(9)

from (8) and (9), one can show that the gauge potential a rigorously satises the gauge

transformation

a = a + b = s(a + b)s1 + dss1

let v(i) (i = 1, 2, 3) be an orthonormal basis of su(2) cliord vector with the orthogonal

relations:

i.e.

v(i)  v(j) = ij

v a
(i)v a

(j) = ij ,

where v(i)  v(j) is the cliord scalar product dened by19

v(i)  v(j) =

1
2

(v(i)v(j) + v(j)v(i)).

4

(10)

(11)

since the potential a is also a su(2) cliord vector, we have the projection formula

a = (a  v(i))v(i).

substituting this formula into (3), we obtain

dv(i) = dv(i)  (a  v(j))[v(j), v(i)],

using (10), (11) and (13), and considering that

[v(j), v(i)] = 2v(j)v(i)  2v(i)  v(j),

we can rewrite a as

a = 1/4dv(i)v(i)  1/4dv(i)v(i).

according to (7), we dene that

and

a =

1
4

dv(i)v(i),

b =

1
4

dv(i)v(i).

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

it is easy to prove that the decomposition formula above satises the requirement in(6),

even has global property and is independent from the local coordinates.

let a family {w, v, u,   } be an open cover of m and suv be the transition matrix

function which satisfy the following condition21

suu=1, s1

vu = suv, swvsvusuw = i; w  v  u 6= .

for any two open neighborhoods v and u , if v  u 6= , then

v(i)v = svuv(i)s1
vu ,

(18)

(19)

where the subscripts u and v are represent the open covers u and v correspondingly,

and we know that the gauge potential a undergoes the gauge transformation

5

av = svuaus1

vu + dsvus1
vu ,

(20)

which is the fundamental condition for the existence of the gauge potential on the principal

p (, m, su(2)). in the physics terminology svu is just the gauge transformation(6) in the

gauge theory.

in the following , for abbreviation , we shall use the notation svu = s .

according to (19), we deduce that

dv(i)vv(i)v = sdv(i)uv(i)us1 + dss1  v(i)vdss1v(i)v.

(21)

considering that a is a vector of cliord algebra,we can see that dss1 is a vector of

cliord algebra also, then there exit the following formula19

v(i)vdss1v(i)v = 3dss1.

(22)

noticing that

dv(i)v = sdv(i)us1,

from (15), and making use of (19), (21) and (22), one can easily obtain

av 

1
4

(dv(i)vv(i)v  dv(i)vv(i)v) = s[au 

1
4

(dv(i)uv(i)u  dv(i)uv(i)u)]s1.

(23)

the expression above shows that if the decomposition formula on the open neighborhood u

av =

1
4

(dv(i)vv(i)v  dv(i)vv(i)v)

holds true, the decomposition formula on the open neighborhood u

au =

1
4

(dv(i)uv(i)u  dv(i)uv(i)u)

must holds true, too. this means that the general decomposition formula (15) has a global

property and is independent from the choice of the local coordinates.

we know that the characteristic class is the fundmental topologial property, and it is

independent of the gauge potential22. so, to disscus the chern class, we can take a as

a =

1
4

du(i)u(i).

6

(24)

one can regard it as a special gauge. by use of this formula, the magnetic monopole

can be studied as in68. in this paper we want to discuss the topological properties of a

4-dimensional manifold, a decomposition formula in terms of the sphere bundle over the

manifold will be convenient.

now, let us return to discuss the decomposition theory on the sphere bundle of a compact

and oriented 4-dimensional manifold. let m be a compact and oriented 4-dimensional

manifold and p (, m, g) be a principal bundle with the structure group g = su(2). a

smooth vector eld a(a = 0, 1, 2, 3) can be found on the base manifold m. we dene a

unit vector eld on m as

na = a/||||

a = 0, 1, 2, 3 ;

(25)

|||| = qaa,

in which the superscripts a are the local orthonormal frame index.

in fact ~n is identied as a section of the sphere bundle over m (or a partial section of the

vector bundle over m)5. we see that the zeros of ~ are just the singular points of ~n . since

the global property of a manifold has close relation with zeros of a smooth vector elds on

it, this expression of the unit vector ~n is a very powerful tool in the discussion of the global

topology. it naturally guarantee the constraint

nana = 1.

we can express the unit vector ~n in terms of cliord algebra23 as

where

n = nasa,

a = 0, 1, 2, 3.

s = (i, i~),

s = (i, i~).

(26)

(27)

(28)

we know that n is just an element of spin(3) in terms of geometric algebra19. and we

can rewrite (26) as

7

nn = 1.

(29)

it is easy to see that n has three independent components. since the orthonormal basis

of su(2) cliord one-vector just have three independent components, we can express u(i)

in terms of an element of spin(3) . from gauge transformations of the orthonormal basis

given in 24, and the spinorial transformation given in 25, one can expand u(i) in terms of an

element of spin(3) as:

it is easy to prove

(i) = 2(n0)2ia + 2n0nb iba +2nina  ia.
u a

u a

(i)u a

(j) = ij.

using (30) and (24), as a result, the gauge potential a will be expressed as

a = dnn .

(30)

(31)

(32)

because n is an unit element of the sphere bundle over m , we will discuss the topological

property of the principle p (, m, su(2)) directly by using this formula.

iii. the su (2) chern density and its inner structure

it is well known that gauge potential(connection) and gauge eld(curvature) play es-

sential roles in discussing the topological properties of a manifold. for the principal

p (, m, su(2)) the su(2) chern density is a important topological characteristic. in this

section we will discuss the su(2) chern density by using the decomposition formula (32)

which we have just given in the last section.

we know that the second chern class is the fundamental characteristic of the principal

p (, m, su(2)) , it is denoted as:

c2(p ) =

1
82 t r(f  f ).

8

(33)

the curvature f is dened as

f = da  a  a.

(34)

one can show that the gauge eld f is generalized function when there exit m singular

points zi (i = 1, 2,   , m) in the unit vector eld n. let us substitute the formula (32) into

(34), then

= 0

6= 0

when x 6= zi

when x = zi

.

(35)

f 


where zi are the singular points of n. this means that the gauge eld f vanishes at the

region where n has no singular points, but at the singular points of n the gauge eld f

does not vanish. this feature we will show soon is due to the non-triviality property of the

principal p (, m, su(2)) , and is essential to study some physical problem.

the second su(2) chern class can be rewrite in terms of chern-simon22,26

c2(p ) =

1
82 d,

and

 =

1

82 t r(cid:18)a  da 

2
3

a  a  a(cid:19)

which is known as chern-simon form27.

substituting (32) into (36) and considering (29), we obtain

c2(p ) =

1
242 t r(dn  dn  dn  dn).

in detail, substituting (27) into the formula above

c2(p ) =

by substituting (25) into (39), considering

9

(36)

(37)

(38)

(39)

dna =

we have

c2(p ) =

42

2

aa   1

||||2! d (/x) d4x,

where d(/x) is the jacobian dened as

abcd d (/x) = abcd.

by means of the general green function formula

2

aa   1

||||2! = 44(cid:16)~(cid:17) ,

we have

c2(p ) = 4(cid:16)~(cid:17) d (/x) d4x.

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

(44)

suppose a(x) (a = 0, 1, 2, 3) have m isolated zeros at x = zi

 (i = 1, 2,   , m) ,

according to the   f unction theory28, (~) can be expressed by

and one then obtains

(~) =

i(~x  ~zi)
|d(/x)|~x=~zi

,

m

xi=1

c2(p ) =

m

xi=1

ii4 (x  zi) d4x,

(45)

(46)

where i is a positive integer (the hopf index of the ith zeros ) and i is the brouwer degree29:

i =

d (/x)
|d (/x) |

= sgn[d (/x)]|x=zi = 1.

(47)

the meaning of the hopf index i is that the vector eld function ~ covers the correspond-

ing region i times while ~x covers the region neighborhood of zero zi once. from above

discussion, the chern density (m) is dened as :

(m) =

m

xi=1

ii4 (x  zi) ,

10

(48)

which shows that the topological structure of chern density  is labeled by the brouwer

degrees and the hopf index. the integration of (m) on m

c2 = zm

(m)d4x =

ii

m

xi=1

(49)

is integer called chern number which is a topological invariant of m.

the result (49) suggest that the zeros points of the smooth vector ~ are essential to

the topological properties of the base manifold m. on the other hand, the density (48) can

be regarded as the density of a system of k classical point-like particles with topological

invariant charges gi = ii on the 4-dimensional manifold.

iv. the bifurcation of chern density

as being discussed before, the zeros of the smooth vector ~ play important roles in

studying the chern class of the manifold m . in this section, we will study the properties

of the zero points, in other words, the properties of the following equations solutions

0(x0, x1, x2, x3) = 0

1(x0, x1, x2, x3) = 0

2(x0, x1, x2, x3) = 0

3(x0, x1, x2, x3) = 0

.

(50)




as we knew before, if the jacobian determinant

d(


x

) =

(0, 1, 2, 3)
(x0, x1, x2, x3)

6= 0,

we will have the isolated solutions of (50). the isolated solution are called regular points.

it is easy to see that the result in section 3 is based on this condition. however, when this

condition fails, the above results will change in some way, and will lead to the branch process

of topological density and give rise to the bifurcation.

in order to show this case easily, we want to have some suppose. it is connivent to let

x0 = t, and suppose 0 = 0(t). we denote one of zero points as (t, ~zi). we know that if

d(

~
~x

)|(t,~zi) =

(1, 2, 3)
(x1, x2, x3)

|(t,~zi) = 0,

11

the jacobian d( 

x )|(t,~zi) = 0 will be obtained automatically. we will show that this case

will lead to the branch process of topological density. in this case, the equations(50) will be

rewritten as

and

0(t) = 0,

1(t, x1, x2, x3) = 0

2(t, x1, x2, x3) = 0

.

3(t, x1, x2, x3) = 0

(51)

(52)




it is well-known that when the jacobian d(

~
~x )|(t,~zi) = 0, the usual implicit function

theorem is no use. but if the jacobian

d1(

~
x

)|(t,~zi) =

(1, 2, 3)
(t, x2, x3)

|(t,~zi) 6= 0,

we can use the jacobian d1(

~
x )|(t,~zi) instead of d(

~
~x )|(t,~zi) = 0 , for the purpose of using the

implicit function theorem30. then we have an unique solution of the equations (52) in the

neighborhood of the points (t, ~zi)

t = t(x1)

xi = xi(x1)

i = 2, 3.

(53)

with t = t(x1). and we call the critical points (t, ~zi) the limit points. in the present case,

it is easy to know that

i.e.

dx1
dt

|(t,~zi) =

~
d1(
x )|(t,~zi)
~
x )|(t,~zi)

d(

= 

dt
dx1 |(t,~zi) = 0.

then we have the taylor expansion of (53) at the point (t, ~zi)

t = t + dt

dx1 |(t,~zi)(x1  z1

i ) + 1
2

d2t
(dx1)2 |(t,~zi)(x1  z1

i )2

= t + 1
2

d2t
(dx1)2 |(t,~zi)(x1  z1

i )2.

12

therefore

t  t =

1
2

d2t
(dx1)2 |(t,~zi)(x1  z1
i )2

(54)

which is a parabola in the x1  t plane. from (54), we can obtain the two solutions x1

1(t)

and x1

2(t), which give the branch solutions of the system (50). if

d2t
(dx1)2 |(t,~zi) > 0, we have

the branch solutions for t > t, otherwise, we have the branch solutions for t > t. these

two condition are related to the origin and annihilation of topological charges31. since the

chern number (49) is a topological invariant, the topological number of these two must be

opposite at the zero point, i.e.

i1i1 = i2i2.

for a limit point, it also requires the d1(

~
x )|(t,~zi) 6= 0. as to a bifurcation point32, it

must satisfy a more complement condition. this case will be discussed in the following

subsections in detail.

iv.1 the branch process at the bifurcation point.

in this subsection, we have the restrictions of the system (50) at the bifurcation point

(t, ~zi)

d(

d1(

~
~x )|(t,~zi) = 0
~
x )|(t,~zi) = 0

(55)




these will lead to an important fact that the function relationship between t and x1 is

not unique in the neighborhood of the bifurcation point (~zi, t). it is easy to see from the

equation

dx1
dt

|(t,~zi)=

~
d1(
x )|(t,~zi)
~
x )|(t,~zi)

d(

(56)

which under the restraint (55) directly shows that the direction of the integral curve of the

equation (56) is indenite at the point (~zi, t). this is why the very point (~zi, t) is called a

bifurcation point of the system (50).

13

next, we will nd a simple way to search for the dierent directions of all branch curves

at the bifurcation point. assume that the bifurcation point (~zi, t) has been found from (52)
. we know that, at the bifurcation point (~zi, t), the rank of the jacobian matrix [  ~
smaller than 3. first, we suppose the rank of the jacobian matrix [  ~

x ] is

x ] is 2 (the case of a

more smaller rank will be discussed later). suppose that the 2  2 submatrix j1( 

x ) is

j1(


x

) = 


1
x2

2
x2

1
x3

2
x3

,




(57)

and its determinant d1( 

x ) does not vanish. the implicit function theorem says that there

exist one and only one function relation

xi = f i(x1, t),

i = 2, 3

(58)

we denoted the partial derivatives as

f i
1 =

f i
x1 ;

f i

f i
11 =

2f i
x1x1 ;

f i
1t =

f i
tt =

xtxt

from (50) and (58) we have for a = 1, 2, 3

a = a(x1, f 2(x1, t), f 3(x1, t), t) = 0

which give

(65)

the dierentiation of (61) with respect to x1 gives the same expression as (63). by making

use of the gaussian elimination method to (63), (63) and (64) we can nd the second order

derivatives f i

11, f i

1t and f i

tt. the above discussion does no matter to the last component

3(~x, t). in order to nd the dierent values of dx1/dt at the bifurcation point (~zi, t), let

us investigate the taylor expansion of 3(~x, t) in the neighborhood of (~zi, t). substituting

(58) into 3(~x, t) we have the function of two variables x1 and t

f (x1, t) = 3(x1, f 2(x1, t), f 3(x1, t), t)

which according to (52) must vanish at the bifurcation point

f (z1

then taking notice of ( 67), (70), (71) and (75) the taylor expansion of f (x1, t) in the

neighborhood of the bifurcation point (~zi, t) can be expressed as

f (x1, t) =

1

a(x1  z1

i )2 + b(x1  z1

i )(t  t) +

1
2

c(t  t)2

(76)

which by (66) is the expression of 3(~x, t) in the neighborhood of (~zi, t). the expression

(76) is reasonable, which shows that at the bifurcation point (~zi, t) one of the equations

(50), 3(~x, t) = 0, is satised, i.e.

a(x1  z1

i )2 + 2b(x1  z1

i )(t  t) + c(t  t)2 = 0.

(77)

dividing (77) by (t  t)2 and taking the limit t  t as well as x1  z1

i respectively we get

a(

)2 + 2b

dx1

+ c = 0.

(78)

in the same way we have

c(

dx1 + a = 0.

(79)

the dierent directions of the branch curves at the bifurcation point are determined by (78)

or (79). it is easy to see that there are at most two dierent branches.

iv.2 the branch process at a higher degenerated point.

in the subsection 3.2, we have studied the case that the rank of the jacobian matrix [ 
x ]

of the equations (50) is 2 = 3  1. in this subsection, we consider the case that the rank of

the jacobian matrix is 1 = 3  2. let the j2(

~
x ) = 1

x1 and suppose that detj2 6= 0. with

the same reasons of obtaining (58), we can have the function relations

x3 = f 3(x1, x2, t)

.

(80)

substituting the relations (80) into the last two equations of (50), we have the following two

equations with three arguments x1, x2, t

f1(x1, x2, t) = 2(x1, x2, f 3(x1, x2, t), t) = 0

f2(x1, x2, t) = 3(x1, x2, f 3(x1, x2, t), t) = 0.

(81)




calculating the partial derivatives of the function f1 and f2 with respect to x1, x2 and t,

taking notice of (80) and using six similar expressions to (70) and (71), i.e.

fj
x1 |(~zi,t)= 0,

fj
x2 |(~zi,t)= 0,

fj
t

|(~zi,t)= 0,

j = 1, 2,

(82)

we have the following forms of taylor expressions of f1 and f2 in the neighborhood of (~zi, t)

fj(x1, x2, t)  aj1(x1  z1

i )2 + aj2(x1  z1

i )(x2  z2

i ) + aj3(x1  z1
i )

(t  t) + aj4(x2  z2

i )2 + aj5(x2  z2

i )(t  t) + aj6(t  t)2 = 0

j = 1, 2.

17

(83)

in case of aj1 6= 0, aj4 6= 0, dividing (83) by (t  t)2 and taking the limit t  t, we obtain

two quadratic equations of dx1

dt and dx2

j = 1, 2.

eliminating the variable dx1/dt, we obtain a equation of dx2/dt in the form of a determinant

where v = dx2/dt, that is a 4th order equation of dx2/dt

therefore we get dierent directions at the bifurcation point corresponding to dierent

branch curves. the number of dierent branch curves is at most four. at the end of this

section, we conclude that in our theory of topological density there exist the crucial case

of branch process. this means that a normal point-like topological charge, when moves

through the bifurcation point, may split into several point-like topological charges moving

along dierent branch curves. since the topological density is a invariant, the total charge

of the spliting topological particles must precisely equal to the topological charge of the

original particle.

since the chern density is identically conserved, the sum of the topological charges

of these splitted topological density must be equal to that of the original current at the

bifurcation point. we suppose that there exist l dierent branches. then the topological

density of chern class (m) changes in the following form

(m) =

i =

k

xi=1

k

l

xi=1

xj=1

ij

18

where

i = gi4 (x  zi) ,

ij = gij4 (x  zij) ,

(87)

1  j  l.

with the same reason, the sum of the topological charges at the bifurcation points will be

have the following form

for xed i.

gi =

gij.

l

xi=1

v. conclusion

we have explicitly constructed the gauge potential decomposition theory of su(2) gauge

theory in terms of the sphere bundle on a 4-dimensional manifold. an important observation

of the application of this theory is that the su(2) chern density takes the form of a general

function. and we nd that the chern density have the bifurcation process.

it is shown

that the topological charges are splitted under this case, and the total charges is conserved.

those features are very important in discussing the topological problems on four-manifold.

since many problems, not only in theoretical physics, but also in dierential geometry, are

associated with the su(2) gauge theory, the theory of su(2) gauge potential decomposition,

the inner structure of the su(2) chern density will provide an important and powerful

methods in those elds.
