abstract

light-front (lf) hamiltonian for qed in (1+1)-dimensions is constructed using
the boson form of this model with additional pauli-villars type ultraviolet regular-
ization. perturbation theory, generated by this lf hamiltonian, is proved to be
equivalent to usual covariant chiral perturbation theory. the obtained lf hamil-
tonian depends explicitly on chiral condensate parameters which enter in a form of
some coupling constants.

1. introduction

hamiltonian approach to quantum field theory in light-front (lf)
coordinates [1]: x = 12(x0  x3), x = {x1, x2}, with x+ playing the
role of time, is one of nonperturbative approaches which can be used in
attempts to solve strong coupling problems [2]. it has the advantage of
having simple vacuum state description, because the physical vacuum is
described on the lf as the lowest eigenstate of lf momentum operator.
p  0, and this vacuum coincides with bare perturbative one on the lf.
however the specic lf singularities at zero lf momenta (k  0),
being regularized via cuto |k|   > 0 (which breaks lorentz and
gauge symmetries), can be the cause of noncomplete equivalence be-
tween lf theory and its original formulation in lorentz coordinates.
the nonequivalence can be found even when one compares lf pertur-
bation theory with usual covariant one [3, 4]. one needs to add new
counterterms to canonical hamiltonian to restore the equivalence [3, 4].
a general method to nd these counterterms to all orders in perturba-
tion theory was described in [4]. for gauge theories and, in particular, for
qcd, in axial lf gauge, a = 0, this method gave an innite number of
possible new counterterms [4]. to avoid this diculty one needs to use
other, more complicated regularization scheme [5].

however in (1+1)-dimensional space-time one can use the bosonization
method [6, 7, 8, 9] to treat the theory analogously to scalar eld theo-
ries. these bosonic theories have essentially nonpolinomial form of the
interaction hamiltonian. we show in the present paper how the method
of paper [4] can be applied to these theories. for simplicity we use the
example of qed2. we construct lf hamiltonian for this model in boson
form using chiral perturbation theory to all orders. this hamiltonian de-
pends on fermionic condensate parameters which enter the hamiltonian
like coupling constants. these parameters must be dependent on ultravi-
olet (uv) regularization parameter which we introduce via pauli-villars
type regularization scheme.

the obtained lf hamiltonian can be applied to the calculation of
mass spectrum using chiral perturbation theory. it can be checked that
results coincide with already known ones in the 2nd order [10]. moreover,

2

one can apply this lf hamiltonian in nonperturbative calculations using
the dlcq method [11, 12].

2. the analysis of ultraviolet divergences

let us start with the boson form of qed2 [6, 7, 8, 9, 13] in lorentz

coordinates x = {x0, x1}. it can be described by lagrangian density

l =

1

8 (cid:16)  m22(cid:17)   (cos  : cos( + ) :) ,

(1)

where (x) is scalar eld originated from uv-renormalized fermion cur-
rents; the   parameter characterizes instanton vacuum [8, 10]; m =
e/ is schwinger boson mass, e is the coupling constant;  = m mec/(2),
m is fermion mass and c = 0.577216 is euler constant; normal ordering
symbol, ::, corresponds to the decomposition of the quantized eld in
creation and annihilation operators in the interaction picture, the zero

mode of the eld is excluded, r dx1(x) = 0 (thats why the action doesnt

include the term linear in ).

let us consider the structure of feynman diagrams of the perturbation
theory with respect to (w. r. t.) . the vertices with j entering lines give
the factors

where

ij+1cj(),

j  2,

cj() = ( cos ,

i sin ,

for even j
for odd j

.

propagators can be written as

(2)

(3)

(4)

(k) =

i


,

(x) = z dk eikx(k),

1

k2  m2 + i0

where dk = dk0dk1, kx = k0x0 + k1x1.

first of all we investigate whether the perturbation theory in  is uv-
nite. the interaction hamiltonian is nonpolynomial in the eld , and
one has innite number of diagrams at any nite order in . one can see

3

fig. 1: logarithmically divergent diagram excluded by normal ordering.

that all separate diagrams are nite (possible logarithmically divergent
diagrams, shown in g. 1, are excluded owing to normal ordering).

nevertheless innite sum of these diagrams in a given order in  can
diverge, and this divergence is uv, because it can be removed by uv-
regularization (as it is shown below). let us consider, for example, the
sum sln

sln =


xm=2

dlmn,

sln = snl

(5)

of diagrams dlmn shown in g. 2.

fig. 2: the diagram dlmn with l + n external and m internal lines; l and n lines are
connected to the left and right vertex, accordingly; p is the total momentum going through
the diagram.

this sum is

sln =

yj=1

where p is total momentum going through the diagram, ln is kronecker
symbol. symmetry coecients of the diagrams are taken so that the
sum of expressions sln with all transpositions of external momenta gave
the contribution to green function. we obtain

sln =

2

l!n!(1 + ln)
2il+n

= 

l!n!(1 + ln) z dx eipx 


xm=2

m!

cl+m()cn+m()il+n+2m+2z dx eipx(x)m =

 (cl+1()cn+1() ((x)  sh((x))) + cl()cn() (ch((x))  1)) ,

(7)

where the eq. (3) was taken into account. at x  0

(x)  ln

1
x2 ,

(8)

so that we get the integral over x logarithmically divergent.

let us show that, in spite of this, the sum of all diagrams sln, con-
tributing to green functions, is nite. indeed the divergent part of (7) is
proportional to

sln = 

2il+n

2l!n!(1 + ln)

(cl()cn()  cl+1()cn+1()) .

as it follows from denitions (3), the quantity (9) is

sln = 

2il+n

4l!n!(1 + ln) (cid:16)(1)l + (1)n(cid:17) .

the green function includes the sum

the divergent part of it is

(12)

as it is stated above.

uv-niteness of green functions holds to any order in  in this model.
but we must consider always only sums like (11), not separate sums
sln. as it will be explained in sect. 3, this fact makes impossible the
perturbative construction of lf hamiltonian, by the method of [4], if we
dont introduce proper regularization of all partial sums of diagrams in a
given order of perturbation theory in .

3. the perturbative construction of the hamiltonian

let us try to construct a lf hamiltonian regularized by the cuto in
lf momenta, |k|   > 0, (i. e. there are no modes with |k| <  in
the fourier decomposition of the eld ), and to generate a perturbation
theory, equivalent to the usual covariant one in the limit   0. let us
start from canonical lf hamiltonian which follows from the lagrangian
(1). the interaction part of this hamiltonian has the form:

h can
i =  (cos  : cos( + ) :) =

=  cos  (1 : cos  :) +  sin  : sin  : .

(13)

it can be shown [14, 15] that noncovariant perturbation theory, obtained
with lf hamiltonian, can be transformed into equivalent covariant per-
turbation theory via resummation of diagrams, but in this theory the
integrations over k are limited by cuto |k|  , and one should also
integrate rstly over k+, then over k. the   0 limit of such lf calcu-
lation of the diagram we call lf diagram. to construct lf hamiltonian
one has to nd all necessary counterterms to canonical lf hamiltonian
which compensate the dierences between lf and covariant diagrams.

the method of estimating these dierences that allows to nd all di-
agrams, giving nonzero dierence, is described in [4]. for its applica-
tion the requirement + < 0 is necessary, where + is the index of uv-
divergence of the diagram in k+. this requirement means that feynman
integrals are to be uv-convergent in k+. it is easy to see, that for the
considered theory this requirement is fulled.

let us describe briey the method of [4]. consider, for example, an
arbitrary 1-loop feynman diagram with external entering momenta pi
,

6

i = 1, 2, . . .. the loop momentum k is bounded by cuto conditions
|k  p pi
|  , steming from restriction on the propagator. on the
other side, analogous covariant diagram contains the integration over all
k. therefore the dierence between these diagrams can be found as the

let us estimate one of these -band integrals. we shift the variable

sum of integrals over the bands |k  p pi
k in this integral so that |k| < . then we change the scale:

| < .

k  k,

k+ 

1


k+.

(14)

that makes the integration interval independent of , while keeps lorentz
invariant products like k+k or dk+dk. propagators, corresponding to
internal lines whose momenta are outside of the -band (owing to external
momentum p, going through the line) change as follows:

i


i




2( 1

1

2(k+ + p+)(k + p)  m2 + i0 
k+ + p+)(k + p)  m2 + i0 0

1

i




2k+p

.

(15)

in the paper [4] we used denotations for the lines with momenta outside
and inside of the -band. first one was called -line and the last one,
-line. it follows from eq. (15) that every -line gives a factor of order
o() while every -line gives a factor of order o(1). therefore the integral
over the band is zero in   0 limit if at least one of -lines is present in
the diagram.
similar analysis can be made for an arbitrary many-loop feynman
diagram. the dierence between lf and covariant calculation of this
diagram can be estimated again by considering all possible congurations
of - and - lines in the diagram [4]. it was shown in the paper [4] (for
a wide class of eld theories) that each of these congurations can be
estimated in  as having the order o()(1 + o(log )) with

 = min(,   +   + ),

(16)

where the minimum is to be taken w.r.t. all subdiagrams of the dia-
gram at some conguration of - and - lines in it;  are indices of

7

uv-divergency in k of a given subdiagram;  is the index of total uv-
divergency in k of all -lines in the subdiagram;  is total power of the
 that arises, after the change k  k of loop variables k, from nu-
merators of all propagators of the diagram and from all volume elements
in the integrals over k;  is the part of the  related with only those
numerators and volume elements (used in the denition of  ) that are not
present in the considered subdiagram. let us apply this general result to
our scalar eld theory. all propagators have simple structure. only possi-
ble contribution to the  comes from the volume elements dk. because
we are interested only in the dierence of lf and covariant diagrams,
any conguration should contain at least one integration over k in the
-band. therefore,  > 0 (and   0). due to lorentz-invariant form of
diagrams in k+, k we have +   = 0. it follows from the expression
(15) for a -line propagator that the  can be counted as the number of
-lines in the subdiagram taken with the minus sign. therefore, one has
 +  > 0 (and, hence,  > 0) if at least one of -lines is present. thus,
only congurations without -lines, i. e. at  =  =  = 0, can con-
tribute to the dierence between lf and covariant diagrams. all these
congurations are connected with diagrams, shown in fig. 3, which are
equal to zero in lf perturbation theory. therefore, all dierence between
lf and covariant perturbation theory is related with the sum of these
covariant diagrams.

fig. 3: general form of diagrams giving the contribution to the dierence between lf
and covariant perturbation theories.

however the conclusion made before was based on the estimation of
the dierence between lf and covariant calculation for each separate
diagram. to estimate this dierence for innite sums of diagrams which

8

are present in our model at any given order of perturbation theory, one
must be sure that innite sums of separate estimations converge uniformly
in . but it is not so in our scheme, due to divergency of some partial
sums of diagrams (like sln that we considered above). that is why we use
in the following some additional regularization that makes these partial
sums nite.

4. the construction of lf hamiltonian
with pauli-villars type regularization

we need a lorentz invariant regularization that can be used in covari-
ant and lf calculations simultaneously. we use pauli-villars type one,
modifying the lagrangian (1) in the following way:

l =

1

8 xl=0,1

l 2
(1)l (cid:16)ll  m2
l(cid:17)   (cos  : cos( + ) :) ,

(17)

where  = 0 + 1, 0 being the original eld of the mass m0 = m, and
1 being the additional (ghost) eld with a large mass m1 playing the
role of uv cuto. only the sum of propagators of 0 and 1 elds enter
the feynman diagrams. this sum denes regularized propagator in the
form

(k) =

=

i

k2  m2
(k2  m2

i

m2
0  m2

1

1
k2  m2

1 + i0

=

0 + i0)(k2  m2

1 + i0)

.

(18)

at nite m1 the corresponding propagator (x) is nite at x = 0,
and one avoids the divergency for sums like sln. one can repeat now
all arguments of sect. 3 and conclude that the dierence between lf
and covariant perturbation theories exists only for diagrams shown in
fig. 3. and the dierence between these covariant and lf diagrams
coincides with covariant diagrams, because lf diagrams are equal to
zero. therefore this dierence does not depend on .

the counterterms which must be added to canonical lf hamiltonian
should generate all diagrams shown in fig. 3. let us denote such arbitrary

9

diagram of order n, with l external and m internal lines entering the same
vertex, by rn(i)
lm , where the index i numerates dierent these diagrams
at xed n, l, m. one can express all these diagrams in terms of only
rn(i)
0m taking into account vertex factors (2) and symmetry coecients of
diagrams:

rn(i)

rn(i)
rn(i)
rn(i)

0m rn(i)
0m rn(i)
0m rn(i)

lm = 

m is a number of vertices in the diagram rn(i)

m (1)l/2,
m (1)(l1)/2(tg),
m (1)(l+1)/2(ctg),

for even l
for odd l and even m
for odd l and m

where rn(i)
0m which are equiv-
alent to the vertex, to which the external momenta are joined in the
diagram rn(i)

lm (including this vertex).

,

(19)

the counterterm generating the sum of diagrams rn(i)

lm with all even l

is

the quantity rn(i)
energy density. summing expressions (20) for all dierent rn(i)
same rn(i)

0m is one of vacuum diagrams contributing to vacuum
lm with the

0m , and then summing over i and m, we get

h n
1 = in (1 : cos  :)xi,m

rn(i)
0m ,

(21)

because the external lines can be joined to representative of each group of
equivalent vertices (to one representative for each group), and the number
of vertices in such group is equal rn(i)
m . summing also over all n we obtain
the following form of the counterterm generating all diagrams of fig. 3
with even number of external lines:

h1 = xn

1 = c1 (1 : cos  :) ,
h n

c1 = i xi,m,n

nrn(i)
0m .

(22)

the coecient c1 depends on parameters , , m0, m1 and can become
innite in m1   limit.

10

for the odd l we can nd, that

m rn(i)

0m : sin  :

for odd m. every vertex in the diagram rn(i)
0m has the factor cos  if the
number of its legs is even, and the factor sin  if this number is odd.
the factors tg in (23) for even m, or ctg for odd m in (24), can be
produced by the action of the derivative 
 on vertex factors cos , or
sin , accordingly. summing at xed m expressions (23) and (24) for all
dierent rn(i)
0m and taking into account the factors
m , we get the sum of n terms, in each of which the derivative 
rn(i)
 acts
on its own factor, so that after summing over i and m we have

lm with the same rn(i)

h n

2 = i : sin  :



 xi,m

rn(i)
0m .

(25)

summing over all n we obtain the counterterm generating all diagrams
of fig. 3 with odd number of external lines:

h2 = xn

h n

2 = c2 : sin  :,

c2 = i



 xi,m,n

rn(i)
0m .

(26)

the coecient c2 depends on the same parameters as c1.

now we can write the corrected lf interaction hamiltonian as follows:

hi = h can

i + h1 + h2 = c1 (1 : cos  :) + c2 : sin  :
c1 =  cos  + c1, c2 =  sin  + c2.

(27)

11

the corrected lf hamiltonian generates the theory, which is perturba-
tively equivalent to covariant theory, if the coecients c1 and c2 depend
properly on the parameters  and  of the covariant theory.

let us show that the coecients c1, c2 can be written in the form of
some condensate parameters of the eld quantized at x0 = 0 in lorentz
coordinates. firstly, let us write the eq. (22) in the form

c1 = i



 xi,m,n

rn(i)
0m = i




g0,

where g0 is the density of connected vacuum green function, i. e.

g0 =

1
v

ln g0,

(28)

(29)

where the v is the space-time volume, and the g0 is vacuum green
function:

g0 = h0|t exp (isi)|0i,

with the interaction part of the action dened in the interaction picture
by the expression

(30)

(31)

si = z dx  (: cos( + ) :  cos )

in lorentz coordinates. analogously, the eq. (26) can be written in the
form

c2 = i




g0.

(32)

hence we get

c1 =  cos   i



v g0h0|tz dx i (: cos( + ) :  cos ) eisi|0i =

=  cos  + h0|t (: cos( + ) :  cos ) eisi|0i

=

=  cos  + h| (: cos( + ) :  cos ) |i = h| : cos( + ) : |i, (33)
and

c2 =  sin  + i

1

v g0h0|tz dx i ( : sin( + ) : + sin ) eisi|0i =

=  sin  + h0|t (: sin( + ) :  sin ) eisi|0i

=

=  sin  + h| (: sin( + ) :  sin ) |i = h| : sin( + ) : |i, (34)

h0|teisi|0i

h0|teisi|0i

12

where the |i is physical vacuum state. now the interaction hamiltonian
(27) can be rewritten in the form

hi =  (1 : cos  :)h| : cos( + ) : |i +

+ : sin  : h| : sin( + ) : |i.

(35)

notice that the normal ordering inside of vacuum matrix elements cor-
responds to bare (perturbative) vacuum of usual formulation in lorentz
coordinates. it follows from the bosonization procedure that these vac-
uum condensate parameters are equal (up to a constant, included in the
) to fermionic condensate parameters h i and h 5i, which require
uv-regularization [10], achieved now by introducing the cuto mass m1.
let us notice also that the formula (35) for the lf hamiltonian can be
directly obtained via the method of the limiting transition to lf hamil-
tonians starting from usual hamiltonian formulation [16]. the approxi-
mation used in [16] becomes true owing to the analysis of the dierence
between lf and covariant perturbation theories diagrams, carried out
above, so that this method also can be applied.

one can use the obtained lf hamiltonian in nonperturbative calcula-
tions of the mass spectrum, that can be done on the lf numerically by
dlcq method [11, 12], and compare the results with those obtained in
usual formulations of qed2. in these calculations the cuto in momenta
k must be removed before the removing uv cuto.
