abstract

elliptic curves for the 7-brane congurations realizing the ane lie algebras ben
(1  n  8) and been (n = 0, 1) are systematically derived from the cubic equation
for a rational elliptic surface. it is then shown that the ben 7-branes describe the
discriminant locus of the elliptic curves for ve-dimensional (5d) n = 1 en theories
compactied on a circle. this is in accordance with a recent construction of 5d
n = 1 en theories on the iib 5-brane web with 7-branes, and indicates the validity
of the d3 probe picture for 5d en theories on r4  s1. using the ben curves we
also study the compactication of 5d en theories to four dimensions.

1 introduction

in a series of papers [1]-[9] the 7-brane technology has been developed systematically in

connection with the f-theory compactication on an elliptic k3 surface. it is particularly

interesting that there exist the 7-brane congurations on which innite symmetries of the

ane lie algebras ben are realized [7, 9].

an interesting application of the 7-brane technology has been found recently by
in constructing ve-dimensional (5d) n = 1 theories on the brane web
in 5d, seiberg discovered non-trivial interacting n = 1 superconformal theories
it is quite dicult to obtain such en theories in a

with global en symmetries [11].

hanany et al.

[10].

conventional m-theory description of the brane web. in [10], however, it is shown that
introducing 7-branes in the (p, q) 5-brane web makes it possible to construct 5d n = 1
in this approach the ane property of the
theories with en symmetries on the web.

7-branes plays a crucial role.

5d n = 1 en theories are known to arise upon compactifying m-theory on a calabi-
yau threefold with a shrinking del pezzo four-cycle [12, 13]. minahan et al. obtained the

elliptic curves for the coulomb branch of 5d en theories compactied on a circle [14].

their construction of the curves is motivated by considering the local model of a singular

calabi-yau threefold where a del pezzo surface shrinks to zero size [15].

since the 7-brane congurations are described in terms of elliptic curves [16] we expect

that the curves for 5d en theories may be derived from the 7-branes if their ane property

is properly taken into account. we will nd that this is indeed the case.

in this paper, after briey reviewing the 7-branes with exceptional symmetries in

section 2, we construct elliptic curves to describe the 7-branes realizing the ane algebras

ben (1  n  8) and been (n = 0, 1) in section 3. we then show in section 4 that

our curves coincide with those obtained in [14] for 5d en theories. we also discuss the

compactication of 5d en theories down to four dimensions by reducing the curves for 5d
theories to the known seiberg-witten curves for four-dimensional (4d) n = 2 theories.

2 ane 7-branes

the congurations of iib 7-branes are described in terms of an elliptic curve

y2 = x3 + f (z)x + g(z),

(2.1)

where f and g are certain polynomials in z, and z is a complex coordinate of p1 which is

the space transverse to the 7-branes [16]. the zeroes of the discriminant

(z) = 4f (z)3 + 27g(z)2

(2.2)

determine the transverse positions of the 7-branes. the sl(2, z) invariant is dened by

j =

4f (z)3
(z)

.

(2.3)

when f is of degree  4k and g is of degree  6k, the cubic (2.1) denes a rational
elliptic surface for k = 1 and an elliptic k3 surface for k = 2. let ip,q denote a type i1

ber specied by a vanishing cycle p + q where p, q are mutually prime integers and

,  are homology cycles of a ber torus. a ber of type i1 has the a0 singularity and its

monodromy is given by sl(2, z) conjugate to

t =(cid:18) 1

0

1

1(cid:19) .

(2.4)

thus there exists generically a ber ip,q at the transverse position of a 7-brane. following

[8, 9] we will label such a 7-brane as x[p,q].

type iib (p, q) strings can end on a 7-brane x[p,q]. since (p, q) strings are obtained

from the fundamental (1, 0) strings by the sl(2, z) transformation the monodromy matrix
k[p,q] associated to x[p,q] turns out to be

k[p,q] =(cid:18) 1 + pq p2

1  pq(cid:19) .

q2

(2.5)

given a 7-brane conguration x1    xn1xn we have the total monodromy matrix k =
knkn1    k1.
it is shown in [8] that when |trk|  2 the 7-branes can collapse to
a point. classication of collapsible brane congurations is nothing but the celebrated
kodaira classication of singular bers [17]. denoting x[1,0] = a, x[1,1] = b, x[1,1] = c
we list the correspondence between the kodaira and brane classications in table 1.

following the convention of [8, 9] the monodromy matrix k[p,q] is the inverse of the usual monodromy

matrix.

table 1: kodaira classication, ade singularities and 7-branes. n  1 for in and in

the collapsible 7-branes are of physical importance since they represent the enhanced

gauge symmetries in the bulk. the string/junction congurations giving rise to the mass-

less gauge bosons are found in [4]. this is done by identifying the bps junctions with

the root vectors of the nite lie algebra which is determined by the singularity type in

table 1. it is also important to consider non-collapsible 7-brane congurations beyond
the kodaira classication. for instance dn = anbc with 0  n  3 are relevant when
we describe the seiberg-witten solution for four-dimensional n = 2 su(2) qcd with

nf = n fundamental avors in the d3 probe picture [18, 19].

extending the list in table 1 to non-collapsible congurations there appear innite

series of 7-brane congurations [8] among which we are particularly interested in the en

and een series dened by

en = an1bc2,

een = an x[2,1]c.

(2.6)

it should be noted, however, that these two series are equivalent for n  2, while
e1 = abc2 and ee1 = ax[2,1]c are not equivalent [8]. the nite lie algebras as-
sociated to en are easily identied once we see how e8,7,6 yield the root vectors of
e8,7,6. corresponding to en with n  5 we have e5 = d5, e4 = a4, e3 = a1  a2,
e2 = a1  u(1) and e1 = a1. likewise one nds ee1 = u(1) for ee1 and no symmetry for

ee0. en with n  9 do not realize the nite lie algebra.

the series (2.6) are very interesting since they admit the ane extension [7, 9]. the

ane congurations are constructed by adding a 7-brane x[3,1] to (2.6)

ben = an1bc2x[3,1],

been = an x[2,1]cx[3,1],

where ben and been are equivalent for n  2 as in the nite case. note also the equivalence

relation

ben = an1bc2x[3,1] = an1bcbc.

there now exists a bps loop junction which goes around the 7-branes. this junction is

identied with the imaginary root so that the root system associated to (2.7) turns out to

be the ane root system. thus the 7-branes (2.7) realize innite dimensional symmetries

of the ane algebras ben and been . note that the monodromy matrices for ben and been

are identical

3 elliptic curves for ane 7-branes

let us concentrate on ben with n  9, bee1 and bee0. these exceptional series of 7-

branes have an intimate relation with the del pezzo surface [10]. the correspondence is

summarized in table 2.

it is not dicult to gure out how a basis for the two-cycles

in the del pezzo is translated into a basis of the junction lattice on the corresponding

7-branes. on top of this, the be9 conguration, which contains 12 7-branes, corresponds

to the ninth del pezzo surface which is an elliptic manifold over p1 described by (2.1)

4

with

f (z) =

4xi=0

aizi,

g(z) =

bizi.

6xi=0

(3.1)

the ninth del pezzo, dubbed also 1

2 k3, has appeared in the literature on the f-theory
description of six-dimensional non-critical strings [20]-[25]. this surface is not the blow-
up of p2 at generic nine points, but the position of the ninth point is xed by the other

eight points.

starting with the be9 curve (2.1) with (3.1) we now wish to construct ben curves for
n  8 in a systematic way. for generic values of ai, bi the 7-branes are located in the nite
region on the z-plane. our basic idea to obtain ben is to remove (9n) a-branes from be9
and send them innitely far away from the rest. if we place the removed 7-branes a9n at
z = 0, they are described as the a8n singularity at z = 0 (see table 1). the appearance
of the series of a-type singularities makes the derivation of ben curves systematic. in fact,
according to the tate algorithm, the be9 curve should obey the condition

ordz(j) = (9  n),

ordz(f )  0 (mod 2),

(3.2)

where ordz() means the vanishing order of  in z. writing the discriminant as

 =

12xi=0

i(a, b)zi,

(3.3)

are located around u = 0.

we see that the condition is satised by imposing i = 0 for 0  i  8  n. then we set
z = 1/u and (x, y)  (u4x, u6y) to express the curve in such a way that the ben branes
first of all, to obtain the be8 curve requires

0 = 4a3

0 + 27b2

0 = 0

(3.4)

from which we take

here l is regarded as a scale parameter which will play an important role later. thus the

a0 = 3/l4,

b0 = 2/l6.

(3.5)

generic be8 curve reads

y2 = x3 + 

3u4
l4 +

3xi=0

a4iui! x +  2u6
l6 +

b6iui! .

5xi=0

(3.6)

5

next, the be7 curve is obtained from 0 = 0 as well as 1 = 0. the latter yields

b1 = a1/l2.

the generic be7 curve is then written as
3xi=0

y2 = x3 +

l4 +

a4iui! x + 2u6
l6 

a1
l2 u5 +

repeating this procedure we see that j = 0 for 2  j  6 vanish if and only if

thus the generic curves of type ben for n = 6, 5,   , 2 are explicitly written down by
substituting (3.7), (3.9) for bi (0  i  8  n) into (3.6).

an amusing phenomenon occurs when we require 7 = 0. we nd 7 in the factorized

form, and hence 7 = 0 yields either

two curves obtained from (3.10) and (3.11) are identied with the generic be1 and bee1
properties of ben and been branes at n = 1.
inspecting the discriminant, it is observed that the bee1 curve admits the further de-
generation, i.e. the a8 singularity at u = . we nd that putting

ben congurations. as we will see in section 4 this diagram corresponds to the renormal-
ization group ows among 5d n = 1 supersymmetric en theories.

(3.20)

3.1 massless curves

in order to see more explicitly the correspondence between the ben curves and the ben
branes we now study the degeneration of the curves. for each ben there is a maximally
collapsible sub-conguration of 7-branes [10]. correspondingly the ben curve has a de-

generation which realizes the en singularity. we describe such degeneration by adjusting

the parameters ai, bi. the curves obtained in this way will be referred to as the massless

curves. our results are then as follows:

in order to have the e8 singularity at u = 0, we must set ai = 0 (i = 4, 3, 2, 1) and

 massless be8:
bi = 0 (i = 6, 5, 4, 3, 2). then we obtain the massless be8 curve

setting ai = 0 (i = 4, 3, 2) and bi = 0 (i = 6, 5, 4, 3, 2) we obtain

setting ai = 0 (i = 4, 3, 2) and bi = 0 (i = 6, 5, 4, 3) we obtain

the existence of 5 coalescing 7-branes at u = 0 is understood by noting that be4 =

these cases do not admit further degeneration.

in this section we consider 5d n = 1 supersymmetric su(2) gauge theory with nf quark
hypermultiplets. the vector multiplet consists of a vector eld, a real scalar and a spinor,

and the hypermultiplet contains four real scalars and a spinor. nf quark hypermultiplets
are in the doublet of su(2). note that in 5d the bare gauge coupling 1/g2

0 has mass di-
mension one. when the bare quark masses vanish the global avor symmetry is so(2nf ).
there also exists a global u(1)i symmetry generated by the current j = tr(f f ) which

12

is conserved in 5d. hence the massless microscopic theory possesses the global symmetry
so(2nf )  u(1)i.

seiberg found that for nf  8 non-trivial interacting superconformal eld theories
appear in the limit g0   [11]. at these strongly-coupled xed points, surprisingly, the
global symmetry is enhanced to enf +1. moreover there exist two theories with global e1
and ee1 symmetry, respectively, for nf = 0. the ee1 theory further ows down to the
ee0 theory with no global symmetry. this class of 5d theories with exceptional global

symmetry is shown to appear when m-theory is compactied on a calabi-yau threefold

with a vanishing four-cycle realized by del pezzo surfaces [12, 13]. the correspondence

between global symmetries and del pezzo surfaces is precisely the one presented in table

2.

the brane web construction of various 5d theories has been considered in the literature

[26]-[31] though the su(2) theories with exceptional symmetries were not obtained in the

m-theory 5-brane approach.

in a recent interesting paper, however, it is found that

introducing 7-branes in the (p, q) 5-brane web makes it possible to realize exceptional

global symmetries on the web [10].

as discussed in [32, 33, 24, 27, 14, 28, 29] the coulomb branch of 5d theories on s1

is described in terms of complex curves where the dependence on the bare quark masses

enters through trigonometric functions. in particular, the curves for the en theories on
s1 have been derived explicitly in [14]. their derivation of the curves is motivated by the

analysis of the local model of a shrinking del pezzo four-cycle in a calabi-yau manifold

[15].

alent to those obtained in [14] where u is a moduli parameter of the coulomb branch. it

is straightforward to compare the curves in the massless limit. first of all, for massless

it turns out that our ben curves to describe the ane 7-brane backgrounds are equiv-

theories follow from this analysis. our derivation of the generic ben curves is simpler
since what one had to do is to generate the successive coalescence ows of the a-type
singularities at u = . in order to discuss the compactication of non-critical e-strings,
however, expressing deformation parameters ai, bi in terms of the wilson lines is useful.

this is carried out in [14] by investigating the instanton expansion of the prepotential.

we suspect that this can also be performed in a representation theoretic way as was done

for the case of nite ade symmetries on 7-branes [34].

table 3: degree of variables

4.1 compactication to four dimensions

we now wish to discuss the compactication of 5d en theories to four dimensions. for

this purpose the degree qi (= mass dimension) is assigned to y, x, u in the curves, see
table 3. then the scale parameters l and t 1 have mass dimension one. we are thus
led to identify l = 1/r5 where r5 is the radius of s1 along which the fth dimension is
curled up. this r5-dependence of the u4 and u6 terms in the curve (3.6) agrees with the
one xed in [24]. the compactication limit r5  0 can be taken directly in the massless
be8,7,6 curves. we obtain

y2 = x3 + b1u5,

where we have set a1 = /l for be6 with  being kept xed when l  . these are
in the form of the en singularities which describe the n = 2 en xed points in four
dimensions [35, 34]. this indicates that 5d e8,7,6 theories on critical compactify to 4d

critical e8,7,6 theories without adjusting any relevant parameters. in view of the 7-brane

congurations the compactication limit is taken by decoupling the brane x[3,1] from the

ben branes, leaving the en branes as the background to describe 4d theory.
the situation changes when we consider 5d en5 theories. taking the limit r5  0
of the massless curves does not work in nding 4d theories. recall that en theories have
the nf = n  1 avors. thus, upon compactication, 5d en5 theories are expected
to reduce to 4d n = 2 su(2) qcd with nf avors whose coulomb branch is described
in terms of the seiberg-witten (sw) curve [36]. to see this explicitly, we decouple c

and x[3,1]-branes simultaneously from the branes benf +1 = anf bc2x[3,1] as r5  0,

leaving the branes dnf = anf bc for 4d theory. this implies that one has to take the

scaling limit by turning on suitable mass parameters in the theory. in the following we

show how to obtain the massless sw curves for 4d theories. for this, we recall that, in

the massless case, the relevant singularity structures on the u-plane are given by d4 for

nf = 4, a3 + a0 for nf = 3, a1 + a1 for nf = 2, a0 + a0 + a0 for nf = 1 and a0 + a0

for nf = 0. these are realized by taking the scaling limit in the massive curves for 5d

theories as follows:

 be5 curve:
l   we obtain

this case is rather simple. setting ai = 0 (i = 1, 3, 4), bi = 0 (i = 4, 5, 6) and letting

y2 = x3 + a2u2x.

(4.6)

this is the d4 singularity for the massless nf = 4 theory in 4d. the original nf = 4 sw

curve is recovered via a change of variables as shown in [34].

in the massive curve, let us rst take

 be4 curve:
a4 = 

3
t 4 ,

a3 = 

2

lt 3 (cid:16)l3t a1  18(cid:17) ,

b6 =

t 6 ,

b5 = 

a3
t 2 ,

(4.7)

then we are left with a1, a2. note that a2 is a dimensionless parameter. inspecting the

curve it is observed that the desired limit is obtained if we set

a1 =


l2 ,

a2 = 

2
12

+


t l

.

(4.8)

now, letting l   yields the curve with the a3 + a0 singularity. here the scale
parameter t survives the compactication limit, and hence we identify it with the qcd
dynamical scale, t 1  3. if we now put  = 2,  = 6, t = i33 and make a shift

in x, the massless nf = 3 sw curve follows

y2 = x2(x  u)

(t l)2 .

(4.10)

letting l   yields the curve with the a1 + a1 singularity. the scale parameter t is
again converted into the qcd scale 2. if we now put  = 2,  = 6, t = 23/2 and

make a shift in x as well as in u, the massless nf = 2 sw curve follows

y2 = x2(x  u)

we let l  . the resulting curve exhibits the singularity a0 + a0 + a0. putting

(4.15)

this is the sw curve for n = 2 su(2) pure yang-mills theory.

we set a3 = 0 and (4.14), and then let l  , yielding the curve with the a0 + a0
singularity. putting now  = 2,  = 9/2, t = 1/0 we get the sw curve (4.15) as in
the previous case.

17

thus we have seen that there exists the compactiction limit of 5d n = 1 en5
theories on s1 down to 4d n = 2 su(2) qcd with nf = n  1 avors. for n  4 the
compactiction limit is taken as the scaling limit as prescribed in (4.8). the appearance
of the qcd scale n1 reects the fact that the en brane congurations for n  4 are
not collapsible. it will also be possible to derive the massive su(2) sw curves from the
massive ben curves, see ref.[22] for earlier related computations in view of 6d non-critical

strings.

5 discussions

starting with a rational elliptic surface for be9 we have constructed the the elliptic curves
corresponding to the ane 7-branes ben (1  n  8) and been (n = 0, 1). the brane

picture is quite ecient in working out these curves explicitly. we have then shown that

the curves for the ane 7-brane backgrounds describe the coulomb branch of the 5d en

theories compactied on a circle. the result indicates that the idea of the d3-brane probe
is valid for the description of 5d en theories on r4  s1; both a probe d3-brane and
background 7-branes extend over the bulk r4, and the dependence on s1 is encoded in the

anizing 7-brane x[3,1]. the bps states arise from (p, q) strings/junctions stretching

between the d3-brane and 7-branes. thus there will exist bps states with non-zero
magnetic gauge charge q 6= 0 in 5d theory on r4  s1. on the other hand, the bps
states of the 5d en theory in the bulk r5 are represented as the 5-7 strings with charges

(p, q) = (2ne, 0) where ne is the cartan charge of 5d su(2) gauge group [10]. the level k

of the kac-moody algebra realized on the ane exceptional 7-branes (2.8) is related to q

through k = q [7, 9]. therefore only the nite part of ben is relevant to the enumeration
of bps states in the bulk 5d theory. as just mentioned above, however, the 5d theory
on s1 enables to carry bps states with q 6= 0, and hence the ane property may play a
manifest role. in fact, interesting ane ben structures have already been revealed in the

context of non-critical e-strings [23, 14, 25]. it will be worth pursuing further the idea in

the framework of the 7-brane setup.

mathematically speaking, what we have investigated in this paper is the problem of

18

understanding the moduli of rational elliptic surfaces (2.1), which is a space of polynomials

f (z) =

4xi=0

aizi,

g(z) =

bizi

6xi=0

(4.16)

divided by (3.13). since the moduli space consists of various branches with dierent singu-

larity structures, it is important to consider the interrelation (degeneration-coalescence)

among the strata [37, 38]. the brane picture provides a natural description of such

degeneration-coalescence structures.

the whole construction presented in this paper may be summarized in the following

degeneration-coalescence diagram:

bee1  bee0
be8  be7  be6  be5  be4  be3  be2  be1



e8  e7  e6  (e5  e4  e3  e2  e1)


d4  (d3  d2  d1  d0)













h2  h1  h0





a7  a8



(4.17)

(4.18)

h0  h1  h2  (h4  h5  h6  h7  h8)


d4  (d5  d6  d7  d8)









e6  e7  e8





in the degeneration diagram (4.17) the be-sequence represents the 5d n = 1 en theories.
then the down arrows from the be to the e-sequence correspond to the compactication
to four dimensions. the avor number nf = n  1 is preserved along down arrows for
each n. the e-sequence as well as the d- and h- sequences are 4d n = 2 theories
with various global symmetries where the theories put in the brackets are not classied as

non-trivial xed points. corresponding to the degeneration ows (4.17), the coalescence

ows are shown in (4.18), each entry of which represents the singularity structure at the
opposite side of the base p1.

19

in order to analyze the bps spectrum of 5d en theories on r4  s1 one turns to
the study of the junction lattice on the 7-branes. for this purpose it is desired to have

a further understanding of how the junction lattice is described in terms of geometry of

rational elliptic surfaces. this amounts to analyzing the sections of the massive ben curves

based on the brane picture and its relation to the mordell-weil lattice [39]. the analysis

will also become interesting from the standpoint of the f-theory/heterotic duality in eight

dimensions.
