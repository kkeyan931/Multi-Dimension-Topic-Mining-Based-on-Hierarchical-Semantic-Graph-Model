abstract

we discuss instantons in dimensions higher than four. a generalized self-dual
or anti-self-dual instanton equation in n-dimensions can be dened in terms of a
closed (n  4) form  and it was recently employed as a topological gauge xing
condition in higher dimensional generalizations of cohomological yang-mills theory.
when  is a calibration which is naturally introduced on the manifold of special
holomony, we argue that higher dimensional instanton may be locally characterized
as a family of four dimensional instantons over a supersymmetric (n  4) cycle 
with respect to the calibration . this is an instanton conguration on the total
space of the normal bundle n () of the submanifold  and regarded as a natural
generalization of point-like instanton in four dimensions that plays a distinguished
role in a compactication of instanton moduli space.

1 introduction

instantons or (anti-)self-dual connections in four dimensions are interesting and important
objects both in mathematics and physics. in this article we discuss higher dimensional
generalization. one of motivations to consider higher dimensional instantons comes from
recent developments in string dualities and m-theory, where we obtain low energy eec-
tive (supersymmetric) gauge theories in diverse dimensions. we are also motivated by its
use in topological (or more precisely cohomological) gauge theories in higher dimensions.
we can employ higher dimensional instanton equation as a topological gauge xing con-
dition in brst quantization of topological action in eight and other dimensions [1],[2],[3].
consequently, we expect such cohomological gauge theory explores the moduli space of
higher dimensional instantons. supersymmetry plays a key role in all of these subjects.

our higher dimensional instanton equation is

  f  (f ) = 0 ,

(1)

where  is a closed (n 4) form on an n dimensional riemannian manifold. (see the next
section for details.) we will call a solution either anti-self-dual or self-dual according to the
choice of the sign in (1). we argue that, when  denes a calibration, higher dimensional
instantons are locally characterized as a family of four dimensional instantons over an
(n  4) dimensional cycle . the generalized instanton equation (1) requires that the
cycle  should be supersymmetric. (the idea of supersymmetric (susy) cycles and the
relation to the calibration  are reviewed in section 3.) more precisely, by rescaling the
transverse coordinates to , we will see that higher dimensional instantons can be reduced
to those on the total space of the normal bundle n() of the susy cycle . note that
the bre of n() is the four dimensional euclidean space r4. such a scaled instanton is
the most natural generalization of point-like (or ideal) instanton in four dimensions where
the susy cycle is just a set of points. we expect that it will play a crucial role in an
attempt at compactifying the moduli space of higher dimensional instantons [4],[5],[6].

we already know a trivial example of a family of instantons.

it is the gauge ve-
brane solution in the heterotic string theory, where four dimensional yang-mills instanton
lives in the transverse direction to the world-volume of at ve-brane [7]. this is a four
dimensional instanton trivially embedded to ten dimensional space-time and should not be
regarded as a genuine higher dimensional instanton. our proposal on higher dimensional
instantons modies it in two aspects. firstly, our supersymmetric cycle  is curved in
general and, especially, can be compact, while the world-volume of the gauge ve-brane
solution is at and non-compact. secondly and more signicantly, the moduli (or the size
and shape) of instanton in general depends on the coordinates of the base space  and
hence our solution is not a direct product of four dimensional instanton and the world
volume of the brane.

1

the connection of cohomological yang-mills theories based on the generalized instan-
ton equations to the d-branes and the calibrated geometry has been discussed in e.g.
[8],[9]. in these literatures the entire manifold (e.g. a manifold of spin(7) holonomy for
the octonionic instanton) was identied with the world volume of d-brane or a supersym-
metric cycle in ten or eleven dimensional space-time. this is very natural viewpoint to see
the fact that the cohomological yang-mills theory in eight dimensions is in fact a dimen-
sional reduction of ten-dimensional super yang-mills theory. however, we emphasize that
our viewpoint on supersymmetric cycles is rather dierent from the above story. in this
paper the supersymmetric cycle is not the entire manifold, but a calibrated submanifold
in the manifold of special holonomy on which the gauge theory is dened. the idea of
branes within branes might reconcile these two pictures [10].

2 generalized self-dual instanton equation

the instanton equation in four dimensions is the (anti-)self-dual condition on the cur-
vature two-form f , which is quite intrinsic to four dimensions. we can generalize the
(anti-)self-duality to higher dimensions in the following way. let (m, g) be an n dimen-
sional manifold with a riemannian metric g. we assume there exists a closed (n  4)
form . then the generalization in the self-dual case is

  f = (f ) ,

(2)

where  is the hodge dual operator dened by the metric. in [11] this equation was rst
appeared in the form

(3)

f  =

t f ,

1
2
with a totally anti-symmetric tensor t .
if we think of t  as components of a
four-form t , then the relation of these conditions is simply given by t = ( ). we take
the equation (2) as our denition of self-duality, since  is geometrically more natural
object as we will see in the following. a solution to the generalized self-dual equation is
necessarily a solution to the yang-mills equation, because

da  f = da(  f ) =   daf = 0 ,

(4)

where we have used d = 0 and the bianchi identity. for a conguration that satises
the generalized self-dual condition, the total action is given by a topological density;

z tr(f  f ) =z   tr(f  f ) .

(5)

a typical example of the generalized instanton equation is the equation of donaldson-
uhlenbeck-yau (duy) on a kahler manifold in six dimensions, where  is the kahler

2

two form . to reproduce the duy equation, it is appropriate to take the anti-self-dual
condition. since 3 gives the volume form up to the normalization, we have  =   .
the generalized anti-self-dual equation implies

  (f ) = (  )  f = ()  f .

hence, we have the duy equation;

  (f ) = 0 ,

or f  = 0 .

(6)

(7)

we have other examples of the g2 instanton equation in seven dimensions where  is
the associative three form and also the octonionic instanton equation in eight dimensions
where  is the cayley four form .

when one rst tries to construct an example of higher dimensional instantons on the
at euclidean space, he will soon encounter the following problem. namely it has been
argued that there are no nite action solutions to the yang-mills equation in dimensions
other than four. one of the reasonings goes as follows1; the energy-momentum tensor of
the yang-mills theory

t = tr(cid:18)ff 
 

1
4

gff (cid:19) ,

is conserved due to the equation of motion and the bianchi identity. hence we have

z dnx t(x) = 0 ,

(8)

(9)

where no surface term appears, if the action is supposed to be nite. taking trace, we
obtain

(4  n)z dnx tr (ff ) = 0 .

(10)

since the integral is nothing but the standard yang-mills action itself, we come to the
conclusion. this argument shows that the problem is closely related to the fact that the
standard yang-mills action is conformal invariant only in four dimensions. we have to
accept that we can nd no self-dual instanton with nite action on the at euclidean
space rn or its conformal compactication, the n-dimensional sphere sn. thus there are
no higher dimensional analogues of the basic (bpst) instanton on s4. point-like (ideal)
instantons are important objects in the compactication of the instanton moduli space in
four dimensions [15]. they are modeled after a superposition of bpst instantons. there-
fore, to consider a possible compactication of the moduli space of higher dimensional
instantons, it is desirable to have a substitute in higher dimensions for the bpst instan-
ton in four dimensions. to look for such an object we will try to make a local splitting of

1 this type of argument is known as the derricks theorem [12],[13],[14].

3

the total space into a four dimensional part and the remaining (n  4) dimensional one.
this splitting is motivated by the conformal invariance of the four dimensional yang-mills
action. point-like instantons can be obtained by a conformal rescaling in four dimensions.
taking this fact into account, we make use of the rescaling in the four dimensional part
in the splitting. in section 4 we will work out a possible conguration of instanton that is
stable under this scaling and nd the four dimensional self-dual instantons together with
an (n  4) dimensional supersymmetric cycle.

to elucidate the above idea of splitting, let us look at the case of ve dimensions,

where  is a one form

since

 = n = ndx .

n  (f ) = n  n  f = 0 ,

we see that the curvature f is transverse to n in the sense that

nf  = 0

(11)

(12)

(13)

futhermore, the generalized self-dual instanton equation reduces to four dimensional in-
stanton equation on the transverse subspace to the vector n. thus in ve dimensions
 denes the normal direction to the four dimensional plane where an instanton lives.
in general we have to make it clear what is the geometrical meaning of . in the above
argument the normal direction is dened at each point. on a curved manifold we would
have a curve whose cotangent vector is given by the one form  = ndx. we may think
of this curve as a world line of a superparticle. thus in higher dimensions we are naturally
led to the idea of the world volume of a super p-brane and supersymmetric cycles.

before concluding this section we would like to point out an additional issue in the
energy-momentum tensor of higher dimensional self-dual instantons. in four dimensions
both self-duality and anti-self-duality of the curvature imply the vanishing of the energy-
momentum tensor. this property allows us to consider instantons on ricci at manifolds
such as k3 surface and ale spaces without disturbing ricci-atness. they are consistent
with the einstein equation. unfortunately, this nice feature is lost in higher dimensions.
if the energy momentum vanishes, we have

gt  =

1
4

(4  n)tr (ff ) = 0 .

(14)

if n 6= 4, this means the action density must vanish and hence it gives a trivial solution.
we should examine a physical consistency of higher dimensional instanton on a ricci-at
manifold.

3 supersymmetric cycles

in this section we review the idea of supersymmetric cycles following [16] and [17]. con-
sider a world volume  of p-brane with local coordinates (a) and an embedding of  into
the superspace sm with bosonic and fermionic coordinates (x , ). when p = 1, this
is a standard framework of the green-schwarz formulation of superstring theory. we ask
what is a supersymmetric conguration that is purely bosonic. a supersymmetry trans-
formation of x() is automatically vanishing, since we have no fermionic backgrounds.
the non-trivial condition arises from the requirement of the vanishing of susy variation
of fermionic coordinates;

(15)
where  is a global susy parameter of the space-time sm. as was pointed out in [16]
we have to take into accout the kappa-symmetry of super p-brane action;

su sy  =  ,

the projection operator p is dened by

 = p+() .

p =

where

is a supercovariant vielbein and 1p+1 is the totally anti-symmetric product of space-
time gamma matrices . the induced metric on the world volume is hab = 
b g
and h is its determinant. since we are interested in purely bosonic background, we can
neglect the fermion bilinear terms in (18).

a

now a (p + 1) cycle  is supersymmetric,

if it is invariant under supersymmetry
transformation modulo -symmetry. for purely bosonic congurations this means that
the translation in fermionic direction has to be compensated by -symmetry;

we have

  im p+    ker p .

p = 0 ,

(19)

(20)

for a susy cycle . once the homology class of (p + 1) cycle is xed, the supersymmetric
cycles are volume minimizing. we can see this property as follows; for any (p + 1) cycle
, or a world volume of p-brane, we have

z

dp+1h (p)(p) =z

dp+1h (p)  0 ,

(21)

5

where the equality holds only for susy cycles. substituting the form of the projection
p, we obtain a lower bound

vol.() =z

dp+1h  z

x ()

where we have used a normalization  = 1 and

 =(cid:16) 1p+1(cid:17) dx 1      dx p+1 ,

(22)

(23)

is a (p + 1) form on the space-time. the right hand side of eq.(22) depends only on the
homology class of  and it gives the lower bound of the volume of the (p + 1) cycles with
a xed homology class. in supersymmetric eld theory a bound of this type is called bps
bound. we see the susy cycles are bps saturated states. for susy cycles that saturate
the bound the volume form vol is given by the pull-back x () of the space-time (p + 1)
form  and this means

| = vol ,

(24)

if we identify the (p + 1) cycle with its image in the space-time.

according to [18],[19],[20], a closed form that satises the inequality of the type (22)
denes a calibration on the manifold. then, a cycle with the property (24) is called
-calibrated submanifold . the geometry of susy cycles is the theory of calibrated
submanifolds in dierential geometry. the space-time (p + 1) form  dened by eq.(23)
is closed, if  is covariantly constant. thus we are led to consider the manifolds of special
holonomy such as calabi-yau, hyperkahler, g2 and spin(7) (or joyce) manifolds that
allow a covariantly constant spinor. it is known that all manifolds in this class are ricci-
at. in the following we assume  is a covariantly constant spinor, so that we may use
the (p + 1) form  to dene the generalized self-dual equation (2).

4 topology of higher dimensional instantons

let us consider the generalized self-dual equation (2) with a calibration  introduced in
the last section. the (n  4) form  is used to dene susy cycles on an n-dimensional
manifold m n of special holonomy. following the argument in section 2, we will make a
splitting of local coodinates around a point x  m n into transverse four dimensional
ones (y1,   , y4) and the remaining coordinates (z1,   , zn4). the transverse direction
may be regarded as a bre in the normal bundle n() over the (n  4) dimensional base
space  with the coordinates (z1,   , zn4). at this stage we do not assume that the
cycle  is supersymmetric. it will be derived from the generalized self-dual condition (2).
we then consider a conformal rescaling along the transverse directions. this rescaling
may be equivalent to a rescaling of the metric, which is a standard trick in topological

6

dimensional reduction [21],[22]. but here we will not assume that the manifold m n is a
direct product, which is a usual ansatz in the procedure of dimensional reduction. though
our consideration will be restricted to a neighborhood of the point x we chose, as we will
discuss later our reduction is denitely dierent from the dimensional reduction. this
partial rescaling of four dimensional bre of n() is made possible by the conformal
invariance of the yang-mills action in four dimensions.
in four dimensional case such
a rescaling produces a point-like instanton. therefore, it is expected that the partial
rescaling enables us to see an analogue of point-like instanton that is localized on the
(n  4) dimensional cycle . under the rescaling of the transverse coordinates

the scaling of the curvature is

yi  yi ,

f = 2fyy + 1fyz + fzz ,

and the yang-mills action is transformed into

z |f|2dydz =z |fyy|2dydz + 2z |fyz|2dydz + 4z |fzz|2dydz .

(25)

(26)

(27)

thus to keep the action nite in the limit   , both the components fyz and fzz
should be suppressed and we have a reduced self-dual condition

  fyy = fyy ,

(28)

in this limit. we can think of the equation (28) as the condition satised by the higher
dimensional analogue of point-like instanton that is stable under the partial rescaling. to
make the meaning of eq.(28) more transparent, we write the (n  4) form  as

the rst term is proportional to the volume form of the base space  and

 = (dz1      dzn4) + e .

(29)

(30)

e| = 0 .

by the denition of -operator the right hand side of (28) has to be proportional to the
volume form of . hence, we must have

where 4 stands for the hodge dual on the transverse four dimensional bre. since the
square of the hodge dual operator is one in four dimensions,  = 1 and we nally obtain

fyy = 4fyy ,

(31)

| = dz1      dzn4 .

7

(32)

hence,  has to be a susy (n  4) cycle with respect to the (n  4) form . moreover,
we have

fyy = 4fyy ,

(33)

the four dimensional self-dual condition in the transverse direction !

we have made a partial four dimensional rescaling to get an idea on the higher di-
mensional analogue of point like instantons. the picture we have obtained is a family of
four dimensinal instantons over a (n  4) dimensinal susy cycle. note that this is not a
direct product of the susy cycle  and self-dual instantons. the moduli (e.g. the size
and shape) of the instantons may in principle depend on the coordinates of the susy
cycle . to be mathematically more precise, the four dimensional transverse direction
should be identied with the bre in the normal bundle n() of the susy cycle . thus
what we have seen is that higher dimensional instantons can be topologically reduced to
those on the normal bundle n() over an (n  4) dimensional submanifold , which is
necessarily an -calibrated submanifold. note that the dimensions of the total space of
the normal bundle n() is the same as the original manifold m n. our gauge theory is
still dened in n-dimensions. it is not to be confused with the dimensional reduction to
the submanifold .

to illustrate the above idea let us look at an explicit example. some time ago fubini-
nicolai and fairlie-nuyts constructed an octonionic instanton [23],[24]. (see also [25].)
their solution is to be regarded as an instanton on the at eight dimensional euclidean
space r8 and its action is divergent as follows from a general argument in section 2.
however the octonionic instanton of fnfn well illustrates some of the features we have
discussed. the octonionic instanton equation is the generalized self-dual instanton equa-
tion (2) in eight dimensions with the cayley four form

 =

1
4!

cabcd ea  eb  ec  ed ,

(34)

where cabcd is dened in terms of the structure constants of the algebra of octonions and
{ea = ea
dx} is an orthonormal frame (veilbein). the four form  is self-dual ( = )
in eight dimensions and closed on a spin(7) manifold [26]. on such a manifold there is a
unique covariantly constant spinor  and  is also expressed by

c = cabcdea

eb

ec

ed

 = ( ) .

the constant fourth rank tensor cabcd satises the following identity [27] [28];

cabstc cdst = 6(c

ac
ad
b  d
b)  4c cd

ab

.

hence the linear map

c : f 7 (  f ) ,

8

(35)

(36)

(37)

on the space of two-forms 2(r8) satises

and the eigenvalues of (1/2)c are 1 and 3. we obtain the eigenspace decomposition;

(c  2e)(c + 6e) = 0 ,

(38)

since the linear map c is traceless and dim 2(r8) = 28, we have

2(r8) = e(1)  e(3) .

the octonionic instanton equation

dim e(1) = 21,

dim e(3) = 7 .

f =

1
2

cf 

means the curvature has no components in e(3).

let g be generators of spin(7). from an ansatz for the gauge eld;

we obtain the following solution to (41);

a = gf ,

a = 

2
3

1

2 + x2 gx ,

(39)

(40)

(41)

(42)

(43)

where x are euclidean coordinates of r8 and  is a parameter in integration that repre-
sents the size of the instanton. using the commutation relation of spin(7) generators,
we can compute the curvature

f =

22 + x2
(2 + x2)2 g +

x[g]x

.

then the density of the second chern class is

tr f[f] =

32 + x2
(2 + x2)3 c +

4(42 + x2)
(2 + x2)4 x[c]x .

(44)

(45)

now let us choose a set of four indices 1  m, n, p, q  8, such that the component
cm n p q is non vanishing and consider a four dimensional plane  extended to these
directions. then  is a at non-compact susy cycle, or an -calibrated plane. to
follow the previous argument, we split the coordinates x into those of the plane ,
zi (i = m, n, p, q) and the transverse coordinates y. since r8 is topologically trivial,
the normal bundle n() of the four dimensional plane  is again r8. due to the self-
duality of  the coordinate indices of the base  and the bre are interchangeable. with

9

this special combination of four indices, the density of the second chern class is reduced
to

34 + z2(42 + y2 + z2)

(2 + y2 + z2)4

tr f[m n fp q] = cm n p q

.

(46)

note that if we chose a four dimensional plane that is not calibrated, then cm n p q = 0
on the plane and we could not see such a topological density. finally the integration on
the transverse coordinates gives

z tr f[m n fp q]d4y =


2

cm n p q .

(47)

we nd that the second chern class is independent of the scale parameter  and moreover
of the coordinates zi of the susy cycle . hence the topological type of the self-dual
instantons over the susy cycle is universal. this fact suggests that, if we could take a
compact base space , there would be a chance for the total action to be nite. from
(46) we see that the shapeof the instantons does depend on the coordinates zi and the
octonionic instanton does not have a direct product structure. but the dependence of the
instanton moduli on the coordinates of the susy cycle  cannot be arbitrary. from the
result in [22] on a topological dimensional reduction of octonionic instantons, we expect
the triholomorphic condition would control such dependence. in the limit of the scaling of
the transverse coordinates y  y together with the scaling of the parameter   ,
we recover the standard action density of one instanton solution;

tr f[m n fp q] =

34

(2 + y4)4 .

(48)

thus after the rescaling of the four dimensional bre, we nd exactly a four dimensional
instanton.

5 conclusion and outlook

higher dimensional instanton equation can be used in constructing cohomological yang-
mills theories and the geometry of the moduli space may lead a new development in
mathematics. however, as was discussed in section 2, there are a few issues in a physi-
cally acceptable interpretation of these instantons as solutions in the higher dimensional
gauge theory. these are closely related to the fact that the standard yang-mills action
is conformal invariant only in four dimensions. motivated by this fact, we have paid
attention to an (n  4) dimensional submanifold  and made a scaling transformation
along the four dimensional bre of the normal bundle n(). we have shown that  has
to be sypersymmetric and reduced higher dimensional instantons to congurations on the
total space of n(). though this picture of a bration of four dimensional instantons

10

over a susy cycle gives only a local characterization of higher dimensional instantons, we
believe that this is a good starting point to discuss the moduli problem of higher dimen-
sional instantons. as we have emphasized before, this is a natural analogue of point-like
(ideal) instantons in four dimensions.

there is a nice formulation of small-size instantons in the frame-work of d-branes and
this also explains the adhm construction of four dimensional instantons [29]. it is an
interesting challenge to develop a similar formulation in terms of d-brane for a family
of instantons over a susy cycle. eventually a resolution of the issues mentioned above
might be obtained by embedding the instantons in the brane picture of string theory or
m theory.

in algebraic geometry a compactication of the instanton moduli space can be dis-
cussed as the problem of holomorphic vector bundles. it is interesting to compare the
construction discussed in this paper, which is dierential geometrical, with the idea from
algebraic geometry. the case of holomorphic vector bundles on calabi-yau three-folds or
four-folds seems to be a good example for the comparison.
