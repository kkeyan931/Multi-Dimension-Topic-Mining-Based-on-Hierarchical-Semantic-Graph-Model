operator product expansion and factorization in the

h +

3 -wznw model

j. teschner

abstract. precise descriptions are given for the operator product expansion of generic
primary elds as well as the factorization of four point functions as sum over intermediate
states. the conjecture underlying the recent derivation of the space-time current algebra
for string theory on ads3 by kutasov and seiberg is thereby veried. the roles of
microscopic and macroscopic states are further claried. the present work provides
the conformal eld theory prerequisites for a future study of factorization of amplitudes
for string theory on ads3 as well as operator product expansion in the corresponding
conformal eld theory on the boundary.

1. introduction

the h +

3 -wznw model plays an important role for the study of string theory on back-
grounds that contain an ads3-part. interest in such backgrounds was renewed by malda-
cenas conjectures [1], which predict that string theory on backgrounds with ads3 should
be equivalent to a two dimensional conformal eld theory on the boundary of ads3. one
point that makes the study of the ads3 case of maldacenas conjectures particularly in-
teresting is that the exact solvability of the h +
3 -wznw model [2][3] makes it possible to
study the ads-cft correspondence beyond the supergravity approximation [4][5]. more
precisely, it becomes possible to investigate the regime where the string coupling is small,
but where the string length may be of the same order as the curvature radius of ads3,
which is a genuinely stringy regime.

important steps in this direction were taken in the already mentioned papers [4][5] by
showing (among others) that the spectrum generating algebra for string theory on ads3
(which is identied with the chiral algebra of the corresponding cft on the boundary)
can be constructed by worldsheet methods. this was rst done by free eld methods in
[4] which is good enough for the identication of observables and their transformation
properties, as well as the study of sectors describing strings stretched along the boundary
(as discussed in [5][6]). in general one needs to consider the full interacting h +
3 -wznw
model as was done in [5], where the spectrum generating algebra was constructed in terms
of primary elds and currents of the h +
3 -wznw model. this construction was based on a
conjecture (eqn. (2.35) of [5]) on the ope of a certain h +
3 -wznw primary eld 1 with
a general primary eld. one result of the present paper will be to prove this conjecture
on the basis of the results of [3]. the crucial point is that the contributions to the ope of
two primary eld with ope coecients that contain delta-functions follow unambigously
from the smooth coecients determined in [3] via analytic continuation.

on the other hand, the author would like to take the opportunity to complete the
results of [3] in view of future applications such as to string theory on ads3. this
includes choosing a new normalization for the primary eld which is more natural from
the point of view of string theory on ads3 than the one used in [3], and describing
how the operator product expansion (ope) of two general primary elds is fully and
unambigously determined from the results in [3].

one of the main objectives of the present work however is to present a discussion of
factorization for the four point function in the h +
3 -wznw model which should provide
all ingredients needed from the h +
3 -wznw model for a future study of factorization and
ope in the spacetime cft. this includes a clarication of the roles of macroscopic and
microscopic states and their correspondence to operators. it is sometimes claimed that
state-operator correspondence breaks down in the h +
3 -wznw model. this turns out to
be rather misleading in view of the results of the present paper.
it is found that the
distinction between macroscopic and macroscopic states is in fact inessential as far as
state-operator correspondence is concerned. this will basically be a consequence of the
remarkable analyticity properties of the three point function found in [3]. the dierence
between microscopic and macroscopic states is of course essential for their appearance as
intermediate states in correlation functions.

the paper is organized as follows: section 2 summarizes results from [3], rewritten using
the new normalization of primary elds. the motivation for choosing this normalization
will be explained. besides that, the main new point of this section is a more precise
discussion of macroscopic and microscopic states.

section 3 describes how to obtain the ope in the general case from the special case
presented in section 2 via analytic continuation. it is found that the ope generically con-
tains contributions which involve delta-functions in the ope coecient. the conjecture
used in [5] is a particular case of the opes studied.

the fourth section then discusses factorization of the four point function.

it takes
the form of an integral w.r.t. the label j of the intermediate representation, where the
integrand factorizes into structure constants, two-point function and conformal blocks.

the author has chosen to defer a couple of more technical aspects to appendices in

order to facilitate access to the main results and ideas in the body of the paper.

appendix a provides some details on how to x the normalization and the relation

between the normalizations used here and in [3].

appendix b demonstrates how the contributions to ope and factorization of four point
function are determined by the current algebra symmetry. the innite-dimensionality of
the zero mode representation introduces some new features as compared to other cft.
the results of this appendix, although rather technical in nature, are of fundamental
importance for the bootstrap approach to the h +

3 -wznw model.

appendix c nally discusses the knizhnik-zamolodchikov (kz) equations that corre-

lation function of the h +

3 -wznw model satisfy.

acknowledgements the author whishes to thank d. kutasov and n.seiberg for en-
couragement to publish his observation concerning the derivation of the ope used in [5]
from the results of [3], as well as interesting remarks concerning string theory on ads3.

2. some results on the h +

3 -wznw model

the h +

3 -wznw is a conformal eld theory that may be described by the lagrangian

(1)

l = k(  + e2 ),

see [2] for more details on the lagrangian formulation of this model. the aim of the present
section is to briey summarize the picture that has emerged from [2][3][7]. details on the
relation of the normalizations used here and in [3] are given in appendix a.

2.1. canonical quantization. canonical quantization is performed by introducing
canonical momenta (, , ) for the elds (, , ) and dening the operator algebra by
canonical commutation relations. the space of states v is then dened as tensor product
of a schrodinger representation for the zero modes (0, 0, 0) on l2(h +
3 , e20d0d20)
with a representation of the non-zero modes on a fock-space f , see [3] for more details.1
states are represented by wave-functions (h)  (0, 0, 0) taking values in f . there
is a nondegenerate hermitian form on f that makes the hamiltonian symmetric, but which
is not positive denite.

the space of states v carries a representation of two (left/right) commuting isomorphic

the expressions for the generators in terms of the canonical elds contains terms pro-
portional to e20 which reect the interaction of the h +
3 -wznw model. these terms
disappear for 0  , in which case one recovers free eld representations of the sl2
current algebra. these free eld representations dier from the usual free eld represen-
tations by a dierent treatment of the zero modes: the zero mode representation space is
s(c) and the generators 0, 0 act as multiplication operators, their conjugate momenta
0, 0 as the corresponding derivatives.

as usual one has associated with the current algebras two commuting virasoro algebras

with generators ln, ln by means of the sugawara construction:

[3] to (b, bv, bv) and (b, bv, v) respectively, where b2 = k  2. moreover, the central charge k
used here is the negative of the central charge that appears there.

2.2. spectrum. the decomposition of v into irreducible representations [2] can be writ-
ten as

(4)

v 

z

c+

dj rj,

where c+ =  1
2 + ir+ and the representations rj are dened as follows: one starts
with a representation pj for the zero modes j a
0 which corresponds to a principal
series representation of sl(2, c). it may be realized e.g. on the schwartz-space s(c) of
functions on c by means of the dierential operators da
j

0 , j a

j = x2x + 2jx

(5)
together with their complex conjugates da
j on s(c). this representation of the zero
mode algebra is then extended to a representation of the full current algebra by requiring
npj = 0 = j a

npj, n > 0, and generating the space rj by acting with the generators j a

j a
n, n < 0.

2.3. microscopic vs. macroscopic states.

2.3.1. macroscopic states. it is expected that a convenient plane wave basis for v can be
constructed in terms of wave functions (j; x|h), j   1
2 + ir+, x  c, that are uniquely
characterized by the asymptotic behavior

(6)

(cid:0) 1

2 + i(cid:1)e2i0|0  x|4i2(cid:17),

together with their descendants obtained by acting with generators j a
b(j) that appears in (6) will be given later in (17).

n, j a

n. the function

the corresponding states |j; xi and their duals hj; x| are more precisely to be under-
stood as distributions on dense subspaces s  v. from the asymptotic behavior (6) one
would expect them to be delta-function normalizable, so following the terminology of [8]
one may call them macroscopic states. it indeed turns out (cf. the appendix a) that
the normalization implied by (6) is equivalent to

(7)

h 1

2  i2; x2|  1

2  i1; x1i = (2)(x2  x1)(2  1).

2.3.2. microscopic states. the wave-functions (j; x|h) are expected to possess an ana-
lytic continuation w.r.t. the variable j 2. the states |j; xi, hj; x| for j /  1
2 + ir are not
even delta-function normalizable (cf. (6)) and will be called microscopic states. the
microscopic states can still be understood as distributions on dense subspaces tj  v,
but their domains tj will be considerably smaller than those of the macroscopic states,
e.g. not include subspaces s  v like the schwartz-space. the dierence between mi-
croscopic states and macroscopic states is crucial for their possible appearance in the
spectrum: the non-appearance of microscopic states in spectral decompositions follows
from rather general arguments as e.g. summarized in [10]. however, this distinction will
turn out (cf. section 3.3.2 below) not to be relevant for the possibility of having a suitable
generalization of state-operator correspondence in the h +

3 -wznw model.

2see [9] for some discussion of the corresponding issue in liouville theory

operator product expansion and factorization in the h +
3

-wznw model

2.3.3. description of microscopic states in a spectral representation. in a spectral repre-
sentation (4) one may characterize hj, x| as follows. it is dened on the subspace tj  v
of vectors

|i =z

djz

d2x 0(j; x)|j; xi + descendants

(8)

(9)

c+

c

where 0(j; x) is analytic in a connected domain that contains the axis  1
2 + ir+ and
has the point j = j in its closure, and such that limj j 0(j; x)  0(j; x) exists. the
value of the linear form hj, x| on |i is then given by hj, x|i = 0(j; x).

2.3.4. generalization. more generally one may dene vhh to be the linear space consisting
of vectors of the form

|i =|imacr + |imicr

=z

djz

c+

c

d2x 0(j; x)|j; xi +xji

z

c

d2x0(j; x)|j; xi + descendants,

where i is some nite subset of c\ 1
2 +ir. the notation vhh (hh for hartle-hawking) is
used in analogy to the notation used in [8] for the space of microscopic states in liouville
theory.

an inner product of two microscopic states h2| and |1i can then be dened when-

ever

1. the sets i2 and i1 dened by writing h2| and |1i as in (9) are disjoint,
2. macrh2| is in the domain of |1imicr and |1imacr is in the domain of micrh2|, and

nally

3. macrh2|1imacr exists.

it is then given by

(10)

h2|1i = macrh2|1imicr + micrh2|1imacr + macrh2|1imacr

although these denitions certainly call for further generalization and renement, they
will turn out to be sucient for a consistent interpretation of microscopic intermediate
states in correlation functions.

2.4. primary elds.

2.4.1. one is interested in operators j(x|z), x, z  c having the following characteristic
ope

(11)

j a(z)j(x|w) =

1

z  w

da

j j(x|w),

j a(z)j(x|w) =

1

z  w

da

j j(x|w).

the operators j(x|z) are primary also w.r.t. the sugawara virasoro algebra with con-
formal dimensions

(12)

j = 

1

k  2

j(j + 1).

6

j. teschner

2.4.2. such operators can semiclassically be identied with the following functions of the
variables that appear in the h +

3 -lagrangian:

(13)

j(x|z) =

2j + 1

 (cid:16)(  x)(  x)e + e(cid:17)2j

.

normal ordering will not allow the quantum operators to have such a simple form. they
should however simplify for    where the interaction vanishes:

(14)

j(x|z)  : e2(j1)(z) : 2((z)  x) + b(j) : e2j(z) : |(z)  x|4j.

the operator 2(  x) makes sense when smeared over x since functions of (z) do not
require normal ordering.

2.4.3. one would expect that such operators can be constructed for any complex value
of j. operator-state correspondence
j(x|z)|0i = |j; xi

|z|4j h0|j1(x|z) = hj; x|

(15)

lim
z0

lim
z

is then to be understood in the distributional sense, i.e. when evaluated against states in
tj.

2.4.4. the asymptotic expression (14) xes a normalization for j which will be moti-
vated in the following subsection. it will be shown in appendix a that this normalization
is equivalent to the two point function

where the coecient function b(j) is explicitely given as

h 1

2 i

(x2|z2) 1

2 +i(x1|z1)i =

=|z2  z1|4(cid:16)(2)(x2  x1)(  ) + b(cid:0) 1
(1 + b2(2j + 1)(cid:1)
b(j) = (cid:0)(b)(cid:1)2j+1 2j + 1
(1  b2(2j + 1)(cid:1),



2 + i(cid:1)|x2  x1|2(2i1)( + )(cid:17),

(b) = 

(1  b2)
(1 + b2)

,

b2 =

1

k  2

.

2.4.5. there is a linear relation between the operators j(x|w) and j1(x|w):

(16)

(17)

(19)

(18)

j(x|z) = r(j)(ijj1)(x|z),

where the reection amplitude r(j) is given by

r(j) = (cid:0)(b)(cid:1)2j+1 (1 + b2(2j + 1)(cid:1)
(1  b2(2j + 1)(cid:1),

is the intertwining operator that establishes the equivalence of the sl(2, c)-

and ij
representations pj1 and pj:

(20)

(ijj1)(x|z) =

2j + 1



zc

d2x |x  x|4jj1(x|z).

the operator ij is normalized such that ij1  ij = id, which implies its unitarity for
j   1
2 +ir. this means that the map between in- and out-states created by the operator
j(x|z) according to (15) is also unitary for these values of j.

2.5. normalization. for applications to string theory on ads3 one is interested in
negative values of j since j  h acquires the interpretation of being the scaling dimension
of an operator in the cft living on the boundary. as one hopes this cft to be stable,
one should only have positive h in the spectrum.

the vertex operators in the h +

3 -wznw model can be used as ingredients for string the-
ory vertex operators that describe scattering of strings created by sources on the boundary.
for example, there is a class of vertex operators that take the form

(21)

d2z j(x|z) n(z);

j + n = 1,

vn(x) =zc

where n is a spinless worldsheet operator in the cft describing n . such vertex operators
are interpreted as describing a string state created by a pointlike source located at the
point x of the boundary [11], [5].

for this interpretation one needs that the leading behavior of the vertex operator
j(x|z) for    is proportional to 2(  x), which is in fact found from the semiclas-
sical expression (13) (cf.
loc. cit.). it is then natural to normalize the vertex operators
j(x|z) to have asymptotics (14). semiclassically this corresponds to using the elds (13).

2.6. three point function. the three point function of the vertex operators j(x|w)
normalized by (16) takes the form

(22)

hj3(x3|z3)j2(x2|z2)j1(x1|z1)i = d(j3, j2, j1)c(j3, j2, j1|x3, x2, x1) 

 |z1  z2|2(321)|z1  z3|2(213)|z2  z3|2(123).

2.6.1. structure constants d(j3, j2, j1).

(23)

d(j3, j2, j1) =

g(j1 + j2 + j3 + 1)g(j1 + j2  j3)g(j1 + j3  j2)g(j2 + j3  j1)

((b))j1j2j31 g0 g(2j1 + 1)g(2j2 + 1)g(2j3 + 1)

.

the special function g(j) is related to the -function introduced in [12] via g(j) =
bb2x(x+1+b2)1(bj) and

(24)

g0 = 22 (1 + b2)
(b2)

g(1)

the -function was in loc. cit. dened by an integral representation which converges in
the strip 0 < re(x) < q/2 and denes an analytic function there. it may alternatively
be constructed out of the barnes double gamma function[13][14] as follows:

1(s) = 2(s|b, b1)2(b + b1  s|b, b1),

log 2(s|1, 2) = lim
t0


t

xn1,n2=0

(s + n11 + n22)t.

2.6.2. the coecients c(j3, j2, j1|x3, x2, x1).

c(j3, j2, j1|x3, x2, x1) = |x1  x2|2(j1+j2j3)|x1  x3|2(j1+j3j2)|x2  x3|2(j2+j3j1)

(25)
they are clebsch-gordan coecients3 for the decomposition of the tensor product pj2pj1
of sl(2, c) principal series representations, cf. [15].

3more precisely: distributional kernel

8

j. teschner

the xi-dependence of the c(j3, j2, j1|x3, x2, x1) is uniquely xed by sl(2, c)-invariance

as long as none of j1 + j2  j3, j1 + j3  j2, j2 + j3  j1 equals n  1, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

2.7. operator product expansion. the following result [3] provides the basis for a
complete determination of the operator product expansion for any product j2j1, ji =
ji(xi, xi|zi, zi), i = 1, 2:

there is a range r for the values of j2, j1 given by the inequalities

(26)

|re(j

21)| < 1
2

j+
21 = j2 + j1 + 1,

j
21 = j2  j1.

such that the operator product expansion takes the form

j2(x2|z2)j1(x1|z1) =zc+

dj3 d21(j3) |z2  z1|21(j3) (cid:0)j21(j3)j31(cid:1)(z1)

+ descendants,

where the operator (j21(j3)j31)(z1) has been dened as

(27)

(28)

(cid:0)j21(j3)j31(cid:1)(z1) zc

d2x3 c(j3, j2, j1|x3, x2, x1)j31(x3|z1)

and the abbreviations d21(j3) = d(j3, j2, j1) and 21(j3) = j3  j2  j1 have been in-
troduced for later convenience. a more precise description of the descendant contributions
is given in appendix b.

the region (26) will turn out to be precisely the maximal region in which j1, j2 may
vary such that none of the poles of the integrand in (27) hits the contour c of integration
over j3 in the ope.

3. analytic continuation of the ope

the aim of the present section is to demonstrate that the operator product expansion

(27) admits an analytic continuation to generic complex values of j1, j2.

3.1. analytic properties of the integrand in (27).

3.1.1. reection property. it will be important to note that the integrand of the j3-
integration in (27) is symmetric under j3  j3  1. this can be seen as a consequence
of the reection relation (18) when used to express the operator j31 in terms of j3.
the integral over x3 in (28) may then be carried out by using the integral (see e.g. [16])

(29)

d2t |t|2a|1  t|2b = 

(1  x)
the resulting functional equation for (j21(j3)j31)(z1) can be written as

which can be easily veried using the functional equations g(x) = g(x  1  b2) and

which follow from the corresponding functional equations of the -function given in [12].
the relations (30) and (32) imply the symmetry of the integrand in (27) under j3 
j3  1.

3.1.2. poles of the structure constants. to obtain the meromorphic contination of the
structure constants d(j3, j2, j1) one may note that the function g(j) admits a mero-
morphic continuation to the complex j plane which may be dened by the functional
it follows that the function g(j) has poles for j = n + mb2 and
relations (32).
j = (n + 1)  (m + 1)b2, n, m = 0, 1, 2, . . . . the resulting set of poles of the structure
constants is given by

(33)

21  1  n  mb2
21  (n + 1)  (m + 1)b2

j3 =j+
j3 =j
j3 =  j

21  (n + 1)  (m + 1)b2

21 + n + (m + 1)b2
21 + n + mb2

j3 =j+
j3 =j
j3 =  j

21 + n + mb2

n, m = 0, 1, 2, . . .

3.1.3. poles of the operator j21(j3)j31. concerning the meromorphic continuation of
the operator (j21(j3)j31)(z1) one should rst note that the distribution |x|2j is mero-
morphic in j with poles at j = n  1, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . and residues

(34)

res

j=n1

|x|2j =


(n!)2 (n,n)(x) 


(n!)2 (xx)n(x),

[21]. one consequently nds poles of the ope coecients for j3 = j+

21 + n,

see e.g.
j3 = j

21  n  1.

a further series of poles arises from the integration over x3 in (28). these are related

to the poles from the distributions |x|2j by the reection j3  j3  1.

3.1.4.
it is important to note that the descendant contributions to the ope do not
introduce further poles with positions depending on j1, j2, as follows from the results in
appendix b.

alltogether one nds the following set p(j2, j1) of poles (n, m = 0, 1, 2, . . . )

it is useful to visualize the position of the poles in the complex j3-plane:

the crosses symbolize the rst poles to the left (right) of the contour c, the dashed lines
indicate the lines along which further poles follow with spacing 1 and b2.

3.2. continuing the integral over j3 in (27). when attempting to continue beyond
the region given by (26) one nds poles that hit the contour of integration c+. however,
as long as the imaginary parts of j+
21 do not vanish one may dene the analytic
continuation of (27) by deforming the contour c+. the deformed contour may always be
represented as the sum of the original contour and nitely many circles around the poles.
these latter lead to a nite sum of residue contributions to the ope. the important
case where j
21 are real can be treated by giving them a small imaginary part which is
sent to zero after having deformed the contour. the result does not depend on the sign
of the imaginary part as a consequence of the symmetry of the integrand in (27) under
j3  j3  1.

only the case j+

other cases is straightforward. for this case one nds an expression of the following form:

finally, one may observe that all terms that appear in the ope are meromorphic in j2,

j1 with set of poles s(j2, j1) given by

(39)

2j

21 = (n + 1)  (m + 1)b2.

3.3. general remarks.

3.3.1. the leading term for z2  z1 appears in the rst term of (36).
following simple form:

it takes the

(40)

j2(x2|z2)j1(x1|z1) = |z2  z1|4b2(j1+1)(j2+1) 

(cid:16)2(x2  x1)j1+j2+1(x1|z1) + terms vanishing for z2  z1(cid:17).

it is worth noting that the state 21  j2(x2|z2)j1(x1|z1)|0i will be in the
3.3.2.
domain of the microscopic state hj3  1| as dened in section 2.3.3 as long as one does
not happen to hit one of the poles (35). one then has

(41)

hj3  1|21i = lim
z3

|z|4j h0|j3(x3|z3)j2(x2|z2)j1(x1|z1)|0i,

which ilustrates how the remarkable analyticity properties of the three point function
make the distinction between macroscopic and microscopic states irrelevant for the issue
of state-operator correspondence.

3.3.3. the ope gets singular for the values of j2, j1 given in (39). this is due to the
fact that the outgoing representation becomes degenerate for these values.
in these
cases there do not exist primary elds unless j2, j1 are further restricted to satisfy the
corresponding fusion rules.

3.4. interesting special cases.

3.4.1. for the special case j2 = 1 one thereby obtains the ope of the operator that
has appeared in [5] as the basic building block for the construction of the space-time
current- and virasoro algebras. the important point is that there does not appear a
factor which depends on j1, as was conjectured in [5]. this is hereby veried on the basis
of the structure constants determined in [3].

it is interesting to observe that the ope simplies in the special case that j2 and

3.4.2.
j1 satisfy the so-called unitarity bound [17]

(42)

1 

1
2b2 < ji < 0,

i = 1, 2

and k > 3. it only involves residue terms corresponding to poles in p 
21. up to terms
containing 2(x2  x1) and derivatives thereof (contact terms) one only nds terms
containing operators j31, where j3 also satises the unitarity bound.

12

j. teschner

3.4.3. another interesting case is that of integer level k. the poles at j3  q
21, m > 0
degenerate into double poles for this case, so that they do not lead to contributions in the
ope.

4. factorization of the four point function

4.1. case with only macroscopic intermediate states. one may start with the case
that

21 = j2 + j1 + 1,
j+
43 = j4 + j3 + 1,

j
21 = j2  j1
j
43 = j4  j3.

in this case one may obtain the factorization e.g.
in the s-channel one may use the
ope (27) for the pairs of operators j4j3 and j2j1 and observe that only macroscopic
intermediate states are produced as a consequence of (43).

the resulting decomposition of the four point function can be written as (see appendix

b for some details)

(44)

hj4 . . . j1i =zc+

dj d43(j) b(j  1) d21(j) gj(j|x|z).

the function gj(j|x|z), j = (j4, . . . , j1), x = (x4, . . . , x1), z = (z4, . . . , z1) that ap-
pears in (44) will be called non-chiral block. it takes the following form:

(45)

gj(j|x|z) = |z43|2(2+143) |z42|42 |z41|2(3+241) 

 |z31|2(4123) |z|221(j) oj(j|x|z)oj(j|x|z)gj(j|x),

where the following objects have been introduced: there is rst of all the usual cross-ratio
z = z21z43
z31z42

.

the function gj(j|x) represents the summation over the zero mode subspace pj of the

representation rj and is given by the integral

(46)

gj(j|x) =zc

d2xd2x c(j4, j3, j|x4, x3, x)c(j, j2, j1|x, x2, x1)

|x  x|4j+4

.

the operators oj(j|x|z) nally are given as a formal power series in z

(47)

oj(j|x|z) =

where the d(n)
x,j (j|x) are dierential operators containing derivatives w.r.t. x4, . . . , x1 of
nite order. these operators are not known explicitly, but the construction given in
appendix b will allow to obtain some important information.

4.2. chiral factorization.

4.2.1. the integral (46) can be simplied by exploiting sl(2, c)-invariance

(48)

gj(j|x) = |x43|2(j4+j3j2j1) |x42|4j2 |x41|2(j4+j1j2j3) |x31|2(j3+j2+j1j4) gj(j|x),

where x = x21x43

x2 = x, x1 = 0 can carried out by using the integrals calculated in [16], pp. 152:

(49)

gj(j|x) =

(50)

fj(j|x)  xj1+j2jf (j1  j2  j, j4  j3  j; 2j; x).

4.2.2. the -functions in front of the second term of (49) can be absorbed by using (31).
it follows that the terms in (44) that originate from the second term in (49) are related
to the terms from the rst one by j  j  1. this allows to extend the integration over
the half-axis c+ in (44) to an integration over the full axis c =  1

4.3. properties of conformal blocks.

4.3.1. kz-equations. the 4-point functions satisfy a system of partial dierential equa-
tions that is formally similar to the knizhnik-zamolodchikov equations for the su(2)-
wznw model (cf. appendix c):

zr fj(j|x|z) =

4.3.2. x- and z-dependence of the chiral blocks. the chiral blocks are expected to be
multivalued analytic functions of the variables z4, . . . , z1 and x4, . . . , x1 on c4\{zr = zs}
c4 \ {xr = xs}. this will follow from the kz-equations (53) once the convergence of the
formal power series that represent the conformal blocks (cf. appendix c) is established.
projective invariance allows to easily obtain the singularity structure from the sin-
gularities of fj(j|x|z). these coincide with the singular points of (55), which are at
z = 0, 1, x,  and x = 0, 1, z, . the singular behavior near z = 0, 1,  is of the usual
form as e.g. expressed by the last line in (52).

interesting is also the singular behavior near x = 0, 1, z, . this can also be determined

from (55). one nds e.g.

(57)

fj(j|x|z) o(1) + o(xj1+j2j3j4
fj(j|x|z) o(1) + o(xj1+j2+j3+j4+k

21

21

) near x = 0,

) near x = z.

the exponents at the singular points x = 0, 1, z,  do not depend on j.

x,j (j|x) has only simple poles at the values j = j

4.3.3. j - and j-dependence of the non-chiral blocks. an important consequence of the
representation of the chiral/non-chiral blocks in the form (45)(52) is that it allows to
control the j- and j-dependence of these objects. it follows from the construction (cf.
appendix b) of the dierential operators that appear in the expansion (47) of the op-
erator oj(j|x|z) that d(n)
x,j (j|x) depends polynomially on j4, . . . , j1 and rationally on j.
d(n)
r,s + 1 = (r + b2s). provided
that the formal power series representation for fj(j|x|z) implied by (52),(47) actually
converges, one concludes that up to the poles at j = j
r,s introduced by the descendant
contributions one may read o the analyticity properties w.r.t. j and j from the lowest
order terms gj(j|x) or fj(j|x). in the case of gj(j|x) one nds from the expressions
(48),(49) that the set of poles in the j-dependence with positions depending on j is just
the union of the sets of poles of c(j4, j3, j|x4, x3, x) and c(j, j2, j1|x, x2, x1), which were
discussed in section 3.1.3.

r,s, 2j

4.4. comments.

4.4.1. the operators oj(j|x|z) are entirely determined by the structure of the universal
enveloping algebra u(g). in particular, they do not depend on the choice of representation
for the zero modes.

these operators may be seen as aecting the deformation of the semiclassical chiral

block fj(j|x) (cf. [7]) into the full conformal block fj(j|x|z).

equivalently one may view it in connection to the kz-equations as a kind of gen-
eralized wave operator that maps solutions z21(j)fj(j|x) of the free wave equation
(k  2)zzf (0) = p f (0) into solutions fj(j|x|z) of (55).

in the case of the h +

4.4.2.
3 -wznw-model it is not a priori clear that the four point
function posesses a holomorphic factorization of the form (51) since the representations of
the current algebra that appear in the spectral decomposition (4) do not show a holomor-
phic splitting as tensor product v j

0 which does not factorize as tensor product of seperate representations

this is related to the fact that the integrand in (51) for any single value does not contain
all contributions of an intermediate representation rj. it is only the sum of the integrand
taken at j and j  1 which represents the sum over contributions from rj.

4.4.3. the kz-equations for the four point functions can not be reduced to a system of
ordinary dierential equations as in the case of the su(2)-wznw model studied in [18].
the problem of constructing a complete (in an appropriate sense) set of solutions to the
kz-equations that can be identied with the chiral blocks is therefore rather nontrivial.
this seems to be the main open problem towards making the bootstrap approach to the
h +
3 -wznw model mathematically rigorous. what can be shown at present (cf. appendix
c) is that there exist unique solutions in the sense of formal power series in z which can
be identied with chiral blocks.

4.4.4. the information on the singularities in the x-dependence of four point functions is
relevant for string theory on ads3 for the following reason: if one tries to determine the
ope in the boundary cft that is supposed to describe the space-time physics of string
theory on ads3, one might consider e.g. the behavior of vn2(x2)vn1(x1) for x2  x1.
this should be encoded in the four point function

f (n|x)  hvn2(x4)vn1(x3)vn2(x2)vn1(x1)i,

where n = (n2, n1, n2, n1). the genus zero contribution to this four point function can
be represented as

f (n|x) =z d2z hj2(x4|)j1(x3|1)j2(x2|z)j1(x1|0)ih +

(58)

h n2() n1(1) n2(z) n1(0)in ,

where the ji, i = 1, 2 are determined by the mass-shell condition in (21), and h. . .in
represents a correlation function in the cft describing n .

equation (57) now conrms the expectation [5] that singularities of f (n|x) for x2 
x1 occur only from the part of the region of integration in (58) where z  0, which
corresponds to j2(x2|z2)n2(z2) approaching j1(x1|z1)n1(z1) on the worldsheet.

4.5. cases with microscopic intermediate states.

if j4, . . . , j1 are no longer restricted by (43) then at least one of h43|  h0|j4j3

4.5.1.
and |21i  j2j1|0iwill be microscopic.

the decomposition of the four point function as sum over non-chiral blocks in the case
of generic j4, . . . , j1 can be obtained by using the results of section 3 for the opes j4j3
and j2j1 in the generic case. it follows from the remarks in section 4.3.3 that the result
will be just the same as obtained by directly constructing the analytic continuation of the
expression (44) by the techniques of section 3.

the resulting residue contributions are well-dened and non-singular as long as the sets
21 and s43 are disjoint. this condition is equivalent to conditions

s21  p +
(1) and (2) of section 2.3.4 for the existence of the inner product h43|21i.

this shows that intermediate contributions of microscopic intermediate states are in-
deed perfectly well-dened in the generalization of the bootstrap framework that was used
in the present paper.

4.5.2. the four point function develops poles for the set of j4, . . . , j1 such that s21s43 6=
. these cases are analogous to the resonant amplitudes in liouville theory (cf. e.g.
[19]). representations like (44) or (51) for the residues at these poles can of course easily
be worked out from the results of the present paper. the integration over j disappears in
these cases. it should be possible to represent these residues more explicitly by free eld
methods.

5. appendix a: comparison of normalizations

the aim of this appendix is to show that the normalization underlying the expression
(23) for the structure constants indeed coincides with the one implied by the   -
asymtotics (14). this is furthermore compared to the normalization that was used in
[3].

5.1. comparison via leading order ope.

5.1.1. the leading order ope can on the one hand be directly obtained from the   -
asymtotics (14): for the product of two operators j2(x2|z2) and j1(x1|z1) one nds that
the   -asymtotics is given by

j2(x2|z2)j1(x1|z1) 

(59)

 2(x2  x1)|z2  z1|4b2(j1+1)(j2+1)h2(  x1) : e2(j1j22)(z) :i,

where it was assumed that ji <  1
2 . the state created by the operator on the right hand
side will be non-normalizable provided that j1 + j2 + 1 <  1
2. in that case there is an
unique microscopic operator that has asymptotic behavior equal to the term in square
brackets that appears on the right hand side of (59):

(60)

j2(x2|z2)j1(x1|z1)  2(x2  x1)|z2  z1|4b2(j1+1)(j2+1)j1+j2+1(x1|z1).

terms that are subleading for    lead to contributions in the ope that are subleading
for z2  z1.

5.1.2. this should be compared with the leading order asymptotics that follows from
the structure constants (23) by using the methods of sect. 3. if one would keep g0 and
(b) in (23) arbitrary one would nd instead of (40) the expression

(61)

j2(x2|z2)j1(x1|z1)  23 g(1)b2
g0(b)

2(x2  x1)|z2  z1|4b2(j1+1)(j2+1)j1+j2+1(x1|z1).

this means that comparison of leading order asymptotics can only x the product g0(b).

5.2. comparison via two-point function. the two-point function of the operators
j(x|z) is recovered as the limit
h 1

(x2|z2)(x|z) 1

2 +i(x1|z1)i,

(62)

2 i

lim
0

which requires a little care due to the distributional nature of these objects. the limit
of course vanishes for  6=  due to the factor g1(2 + 1).
it will be assumed that
,  > 0 in the following. there are however two further terms that behave singular for
      0: the factors |x3  x1|2(i()1) and g( + i(  )). the singular
behavior of the former can be represented by (i(  )  i)1(2)(x2  x1), (cf. (34)),
whereas the latter behaves as ( + i(  ))1 resx=0 g(x). the limit (62) is therefore
given by

(63)

|z2  z1|4(2)(x2  x1)

g(1)

g0

(1 + b2)
(b2)

lim
0

2

2 + (  )2 .

operator product expansion and factorization in the h +

19

the last factor yields 2(  ), so that one would nd the two point function to be

(64)

h 1

2 i

(x2|z2) 1

2 +i(x1|z1)i = 22 g(1)
g0

(1 + b2)
(b2)

(  )(2)(x2  x1)

requiring the prefactors in (61) and (64) to be unity uniquely determines g0 and (b) to
be as given in sect. 2.

5.3. normalization in [3]. the normalization that was underlying the nal result for
the three point function [3] may be seen to be more natural if one is interested in values of
j >  1
2 : in that case it is the second term in (14) that dominates the   -asymptotics,
so it is natural to require this term to have prefactor one. the operators dened by this
normalization will be denoted j(x|z).

the leading order ope may then, as in the previous subsection, be determined from

the   -asymptotics:

j2(x2|z2)j1(x1|z1) 

(65)

 |z2  z1|4b2(j1+1)(j2+1)|  x2|4j2|  x1|4j1 : e2(j1+j2)(z) :

 |z2  z1|4b2(j1+1)(j2+1)h|  x1|4(j1+j2) : e2(j1+j2)(z) :i + o(x2  x1)

 |z2  z1|4b2(j1+1)(j2+1)j1+j2(x1|z1) + o(x2  x1)

this is to be compared to the result that follows from the structure constants of the
operators j(x|z) by applying the method of sect.3. these structure constants were given
in formula (64) of [3]. in terms of the functions g used in the present paper one may
rewrite the result as

(66)

d(j3, j2, j1) =

g(j1 + j2 + j3 + 1)g(j1 + j2  j3)g(j1 + j3  j2)g(j2 + j3  j1)

((b))j1j2j31 g

0 g(2j1)g(2j2)g(2j3)

.

the freedom that was left over by the analysis in [3] is parametrized by (b) and g
0,
which had not been determined there.

before using the method of section 3. to determine the leading term in the ope one
needs to determine the precise form of the ope in the case that j1, j2 are in the range (26)
where only macroscopic operators appear. to this aim one needs the two-point function
following from (66). this is found to be

(67)

h 1

(x2|z2) 1

2 +i(x1|z1)i =h22b4 g(1)

g
0

i 1
42 (  )(2)(x2  x1).

requiring the prefactor in square brackets to be unity determines g
to note the factor
j2(x2|z2)j1(x1|z1) in the case that j2, j1 are in (26) a form that diers from (27):

0. it is important

20

j. teschner

the measure dj3(2j3 + 1)2 is just the plancherel-measure that appears in the harmonic
analysis on h +

3 [20],[7].

by proceeding as in sect.3 one now conrms that the leading term in the ope is given

by (65). the operators j are related to the operators j by j(x|z) = b(j)j(x|z).

6. appendix b: current algebra constraints on ope and four point

function

for both the discussion of the ope of two generic primary elds and the description
of the four-point function one needed to have some information on the nature of the
descendant contributions in ope and factorization. a more precise description of these
contributions is made possible by means of the following useful technical tool:

6.1. dual basis.

6.1.1. to begin with, one needs to introduce some notation. given any basis {vs; s  s}
for the zero mode subspace pj one may introduce an useful basis for rj as follows: let
t (n) be the set of all tuples

(69)

such that

 = ((r1, . . . , ri, . . . ), (s1, . . . , sj, . . . ), (t1, . . . , tk, . . . ))

n = n() 

xi=1

iri +

xj=1

jsj +

xk=1

ktk < 

then the set of all

(70)

j vs 

yi=1

(j +

i)ri

yj=1

(j 0

j)sj

yk=1

(j 

k)tk vs,

where   t (n), n  n and s  s forms a basis for rj.

6.1.2. the main result of this subsection is the construction of dual generators j 

u(bsl2) that are specied by

(71)

0(cid:0)jj(cid:1) = 

,

where 0 denotes projection onto the part that does not contain terms of the form (. . . )j a
n
with n > 0. these dual generators will be of the form

(72)

j = xt (n())

r(h, q) j

(j (,)

0

)(,),

where the conjugation  is dened by (j a

sgn(m()  m()), (, ) = |m()  m()|, m() = p

the casimir of the zero mode subalgebra, q = j +

n) = j a

0 j 

n and (ab) = b a , (, ) =
0 and q is

i=1(ri  ti), h = j 0
0 (j 0

0  1).

0  j 0

the crucial point about the matrix r(h, q) is the fact that it depends polynomially
r,s + 1 =

0 and rationally on the variable q, with poles at j = 2j

on the variable h = j 0
(r + b2s) when q = j(j + 1).

this result gives a convenient representation of the identity on v as

(73)

d2x jj|j; xihj; x|jj.

id =z

j. teschner

6.1.3. the rest of this subsection will be devoted to the proof of this claim. in order to
construct the j one may consider the generators j to be represented in verma modules
vj over the current algebra: the denition (71) is equivalent to validity of

(74)
for any f0  vj such that j a
nf0 = 0 and generic j. the existence of dual generators j
for generic j will then follow from the kac-kazhdan determinant formula [22]. what is
not evident is the claim on the polynomial dependence of the j on the generator h.

f0,

jjf0 = 

to control this dependence it is useful to choose as basis for the verma module the set

(75)

{ej

m,  jej

mm();   t ; m = j, j  1, . . . },

where the ej
that

m form a basis for the zero mode subspace vj,0 = {f0  vj : j a

nf0 = 0} such

(76)

j +
0 ej

m = (m  j)ej

m+1

m = (m + j)ej

m = mej

m.

one may then introduce the bilinear form (., .) by

this bilinear form is not the usual shapovalov form h., .i considered in [22], but closely
related to it:

it follows that the determinant dj
proportional to the kac-kazhdan determinant:

(ej

n) = m,n.

(80)

r,s + 1 = (r + b2s), p3(n) is the cardinality of t (n), r3(n) =pr,s1 p3(n  rs).

where 2j
the prefactor nn may be determined by considering the highest power in the central
charge k, which is produced by the product of the diagonal elements of the matrix b.
the important point here is that it turns out to be m-independent for the chosen basis,
which implies m-independence of dj
n.

6.1.4. the inverse of the matrix b therefore exists for j 6= j
r,s. the matrix elements
of this inverse will be denoted b. it will be necessary to describe their m-dependence
a bit more precisely:

let s = (, ), i = {(), () + s, . . . , ()  s}. b factorizes as

b = c  yki

(m  sj  k),

where c  = c (m, j) is a polynomial in m.

this may be seen as follows: it suces to discuss the case m() > m(), the other
case being completely analogous. one may equivalently x a value of k and ask in which
elements b a factor (m  j  k) can appear.

now one may use the following simple fact: if for a matrix mij the upper right submatrix
with lower left corner at (k  1, k) carries a common factor a, then the same will be true

operator product expansion and factorization in the h +
3

-wznw model

23

for the inverse matrix. this may be veried by e.g. using the representation of the
elements m ij of the inverse as m ij = (det m)1 m ij where m ij is the determinant of
the matrix obtained from m by erasing the ith row and jth column. the contributions
to these determinants may be associated to zig-zag paths that go in unit steps from the
right to the left in the matrix m ij and which never hit the same vertical position twice.
the matrix element m ij will carry a factor a if there exists no path that avoids the upper
right submatrix in m ij with lower left corner at (k  1, k). this is in fact the case if
i < k  j: the lower right submatrix in m ij with upper left corner (k, k) then has less
columns than rows.

it therefore suces to verify that the factor (m  j  k) appears in any matrix element

b with m() < k  m(). but this follows from the denition by observing that

jej
j

mm() = r(h, q)(j +

0 )m()m()ej

mm(),

where r(h, q) is some polynomial in the indicated variables.

6.1.5. the factorization (80) now allows to rewrite the identity on the verma module vj
as follows:

(81)

id =

=

jxm=x,
jxm=x,

jej

jej

mm()b(m, j)(cid:0)jej
mm()(cid:1)
mm()c (m, j)(cid:0)(j (,)

0

)(,)ej

mm()(cid:1)

j
,

where the summation over ,  is restricted by m  m()  j and m  m()  j. the
summations over ,  and m may be exchanged, giving a sum over m that is restricted
by the conditions just mentioned. the summation over m may then be shifted by m(),
where restricting the new sum by m  m() + m()  j is superuous since automatically
realized due to j +ej

j = 0. the result may be written as

(82)

(83)

j,

jej

id =x

jxm=

m(cid:0)ej
m(cid:1)
c (cid:0)h + m(), q(cid:1) j

which is equivalent to the desired equation (74) with dual generators j being given by

j x

 (j (,)

0

)(,)

6.2. descendant operators.

6.2.1. the descendants of the states |j; xi with xed j represent elements of the dual
t.
rj
this can be done by dening recursively

t of rj. the aim will be to associate an operator j(v|z) to each distribution v  rj

(84)

j(x|z)  j(x|z)

j(cid:0)j a

j(cid:0)jjx|z(cid:1)|0i = jj|j; xi

or

ezl1jj|j; xi = j(cid:0)jjx|z)|0i.

the transformation properties of descendants under the current algebra are given by the
commutation relations

[j a

>(w), j(v|z)] = j(cid:0)j a

>(w  z)v|z(cid:1)

[j a

<(w), j(v|z)] = j(cid:0)j a

>(w  z)v|z(cid:1).

0 x = da

j x, so that (86) includes the transformation law (11) as

(86)

one should note that j a
a special case.

6.2.2. the conformal ward identities are now a consequence of the denition (84),
commutation relations (86) and invariance of the vacuum |0i: one may express any
correlation function of descendant operators hjn (vn |zn ) . . . j1(v1|z1)i in terms of
hjn (xn |zn ) . . . j1(x1|z1)i by expressing any chosen ji(vi|zi) in terms of ji(xi|zi) with
the help of (84), moving the j a
>) to the left (resp. right) vaccuum by
using (86), and then repeating the process until only primary elds are left.

<, (resp. j a

<, j a

>, j a

in the case of the two point function of two descendant operators one needs to supple-
ment these denitions by requiring it to vanish when the levels of the descendants of the
two operators are unequal.

h j21(cid:0)jjx2|z2(cid:1)j1(cid:0)j jx1|z1(cid:1) i =

(87)

= |z21|4j1 z2n()
where the conjugation  acts as (j a

it follows from (87) that out-states are created via

6.3. descendant contributions in ope and factorization.

6.3.1. the resolution of
immediately gives an expansion for
the in-state j2(x2|z2)|j1; x1i with coecients given by the matrix elements
hj; x|jjj2(x2|z2)|j1; x1i. this is brought into correspondence with (27) by using the
j3  j3  1 symmetry of the integrand (cf. 3.1.1). one gets an expansion of the form

the identity (73)

6.3.2. the full operator product expansion is now easily obtained by applying the trans-
lation operator ez1l1 to (89) and using (85):

6.3.3.
generators j a

it is worth noting that the polynomial dependence of the j on the zero mode
0 is of course crucial for getting dierential operators of nite order in (90).
it also follows that the descendant contributions do not introduce any j2, j1-dependent

pole of the ope-coecients in addition to the poles discussed in section 3.1.

6.3.4. four point function. projective invariance determines the z-dependence of the four
point function to be of the form

(91)

hj4(x4|z4) . . . j1(x1|z1)i = |z43|2(2+143) |z42|42 |z41|2(3+241) 

 |z31|2(4123) hj4; x4|j3(x3|1)j2(x2|z)|j1; x1i,

where z is the usual cross ratio dened below (45). in order to get information on the
fj(j|x|z) is therefore suces to consider the case z4 = , z3 = 1, z2 = z, z1 = 0.

a representation of the four point function as sum over intermediate states can be ob-
tained e.g. by expanding j2(x2|z)|j1; x1i as in (89), using (73) to get a similar expansion
for the out-state hj4; x4|j3(x3|1) and nally using the inner products (7). one obtains
a representation of the for point function as sum over products of three point functions
which takes the form

hj4 . . . j1i = z

the dierential operators d(n)

j (j|x) that appear in (47) are the nally dened by

summing the dierential operators appearing in (92) over  with n() = n.

7. appendix c:knizhnik-zamolodchikov equations

the derivation of the kz-equations for the h +

3 -wznw model is very similar to the
case of wznw-models for compact groups, see e.g. [23] for a derivation that can be easily

26

j. teschner

adapted to the formalism used in appendix b. it is based on the result that the operators
satisfy the following operator dierential equation in the sense of formal power series:

(93)

d
dz

j(x|z) =

1

2(k  2) xa,b=+,0,

abj(cid:0)j a

1j b

0x|z(cid:1),

where 00 = 2, + = 1 = + are the only nonvanishing matrix elements of ab.

when inserting (93) into correlation functions and using the conformal ward identities

one nds the kz-equations (53).

7.1. solutions to kz. solutions that can be identied with s-channel conformal blocks
must be of the form :

fj(j|x|z) = z21(j)

xn=0

zn f (n)

j

(j|x)

the kz-equation (55) then implies the following set of recursion relations for the coe-
cients f (n)

(j|x):

for n = 0 one has the eigenvalue equation (p + (k  2)21)f (0)
independent solutions are fj(j|x) and fj1(j|x), cf. (50).

j

(j|x) = 0. two linearly

j

(j|x) in terms of f (m)

the equations with n > 0 are inhomogeneous dierential equations that uniquely de-
termine f (n)
(j|x), m < n up to solutions of the homogeneous
equation (21 + n + (k  2)1p )f = 0. however, the corresponding ambiguity can be
xed by observing that on the one hand solutions which can be identied with conformal
blocks have to be of the form

j

(95)

f (n)

j

(j|x) = xj1+j2j(n)

xm=0

xm f (n,m)

j

(j),

where (n) is integer as follows from (94). but on the other hand one may observe that
the exponents n of solutions to the homogeneous equation (21 + n + (k  2)1p )f = 0
at the singular point x = 0 are determined by the equation

(cid:0)n  (j1 + j2 + 1

2 )(cid:1)2 = (j + 1

2)2  (k  2)n,

so if one writes n = j1 + j2  j  l(n) one nds that (2j + 1)l(n) = (k  2)n. unless 2j + 1
is a rational multiple of k 2 one nds that l(n) is not an integer so that adding a solution
to the homogeneous equation to a solution of (94) would prevent the identication of the
solution with a conformal block.

furthermore one has to check that there always exists a solution of the required form
(j) will have to

(95). first observe that in order to satisfy (94) the coecients f (n,m)
satisfy recursion relations of the following form:
+ bmf (n,m1)

(j) = g(n,m1)

the recursion relations are solvable unless there is some m for which am = 0. but
am = (m  n)2  (2j21 + 1)(m  n) + (k  2)n, which will not vanish for any integer m
unless 2j + 1 is a rational multiple of k  2.
