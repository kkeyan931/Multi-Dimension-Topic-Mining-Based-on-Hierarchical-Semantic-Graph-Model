we show that the y

c
ab of pradisi-sagnotti-stanev are indeed integers, and we prove a conjecture of borisov-
halpern-schweigert. we indicate some of the special features which arise when the order of the modular matrix

t is odd. our arguments are general, applying to arbitrary parent rcft assuming only that t has odd order.

1. introduction

there has been considerable interest recently in analysing aspects of the open string
in terms of the parent rational conformal eld theory (rcft) on 2-dimensional surfaces
with boundaries (this strategy is called the method of open descendants)  see e.g. [16]
and references therein for samples from this work.

cardys inuential work [7] investigated the boundary conditions on a cylinder (=an-
nulus), for those rcft whose torus partition function is given by the charge-conjugation
matrix c = s2:

z( ) = xa

a 

a .

(1)

in this case, the boundary conditions and primary elds are in one-to-one correspondence,
and the annulus coecients ac
ab. in other
words, cardy discovered a new interpretation for the coecients n c
ab: they also count the
number of open string states in sector c with boundary conditions a and b.

ab are given by the chiral fusion coecients n c

specifying the theory also requires knowing the mobius strip and klein bottle coef-
cients m b
a and ka. these coecients must satisfy certain consistency conditions, and
pradisi-sagnotti-stanev [8] expressed a solution in terms of an integer-valued tensor y c
ab
(see (9) below). these numbers y c
ab also appear in the fusion coecients of z2 permutation-
orbifolds [9,10].

in this paper we nd a novel interpretation for these y c

ab (up to a sign they equal
certain fusion coecients!) which makes it manifest that they indeed are integers. a
general proof of this seems to be lacking in the literature (see the last paragraph of this
section). this also yields a positivity condition on the ka. we also use this to prove a
conjecture in [9].

our results are very general: they apply to any rcft, provided only that the order
of the modular matrix t = diag(exp[2i (ha  c
24 )]) is odd. in particular, we require that
verlindes formula for the parent rcft yields nonnegative integers, and that equations
(5) below hold. the odd-order hypothesis is vital for our interpretation, and for the
positivity result on the ka, but both the integrality of the y c
ab and the conjecture of [9]
should continue to hold when t has even order.

1

in a recent paper [11], bantay also relates the conjecture of [9] to that of [8].

in
particular, he proves the integrality of y , assuming that verlindes formula will yield
nonnegative integers for an appropriate cyclic orbifold, and assuming results from the
theory of permutation orbifolds [9]. on the one hand, his argument does not assume t has
odd order. on the other hand, his argument is built on a somewhat less solid foundation
than that of this paper: e.g. the formula for the modular matrix s for cyclic orbifolds is
read o from expressions for the orbifold characters, but that technique works only when
those characters are linearly independent, which for general rcft is false. more precisely,
the formula (2a) below uniquely species the coecients sab only if the characters chb( )
are linearly independent, and yet e.g. cha( ) = cha( ). reference [9] includes cartan angles
(corresponding to commuting spin one currents) in their characters, but there seems to
be no reason why these should be sucient to guarantee linear independence for arbitrary
rcft. it thus appears that the formulas [9,10] for the modular matrix s in permutation
orbifolds is conjectural.

2. background material

the characters a( ) of an rcft carry a representation of sl2(z) [12]:

a(1/ ) = xb
a( + 1) = xb

sab b( )

tab b( )

(2a)

(2b)

the subscripts a, b label the (nitely many) primary elds. the matrices s and t are
unitary and symmetric, and t is diagonal with entries exp[2i (ha  c
24 )] where ha are the
conformal weights and c is the central charge. t has nite order [13]: i.e. t n = i for some
n . the matrix c = s2 is the order-2 permutation matrix called charge-conjugation; well
write a for ca.

there are two choices of 2  2 matrices corresponding to the fractional linear trans-
formation  7 1/ of (2a); well adopt the more common choice in rcft, namely
(cid:18) 0 1
0 (cid:19). for this choice, (st )3 = (t s)3 = c.

the fusion coecients n c

ab can be expressed using verlindes formula:

where 0 denotes the vacuum.

we will need two lesser known properties of rcft. both hold for any rcft. the

z(a, 0) is bantays frobenius-schur indicator: z(a, 0) = 0 if a 6= a, and z(a, 0) = 1
depending on whether a is real or pseudo-real.
the other property is the galois symmetry [15]. the entries of s will lie in some
cyclotomic extension of q  that just means each sab can be written as a polynomial
pab(n), with rational coecients, evaluated at some root of unity n := exp[2i/n]. by
the galois group of this cyclotomic extension, we mean the integers mod n which are
n acts
coprime to n  we write this z

12 = {1, 5, 7, 11}. any such   z
n ) = cos(2 a

the point [15] is that to any   z

n . for example, z 

(sab) = (a) sa,b = (b) sa,b

(6a)

see 4 for some examples. dene the signed permutation matrix g by (g)ab = (a) b,a.
then (6a) can be written as
(6b)

 s = gs = sg1

.



these orthogonal matrices g in fact constitute a representation of the multiplicative group
z

n , i.e. g gm = gm = gm g.

this galois symmetry should be regarded as a generalisation of charge-conjugation.
in particular,  = 1 corresponds to the rather familiar galois automorphism 1 = 
(complex conjugation), and 1(a) = +1, 1a = a, and g1 = c. the commuting of the
g then implies (a) = (a) and (a) = (a).

next, turn to the open string amplitudes. the case we will consider here is the best-

understood one: where the torus partition function is given by (1).

there are two channels (transverse and direct) for the annulus, klein bottle and
mobius strip, corresponding to the two dierent choices of time (horizontal and verti-
cal). the two channels give identical amplitudes, provided the modular transformation
relating the natural modular parameters in the two channels is taken into consideration.
this modular transformation is s, for both the annulus and klein bottle, but is

p := t s t 2 s t

(7)

for the mobius strip. by t  here we mean the diagonal matrix with entries exp[i (ha 
24 )]. note that p is unitary and symmetric and p 2 = c, hence p  = cp = p c.

the direct channel amplitude for the annulus is the open string partition function:

it is conjectured in [8] that the y c

there does not appear to be a proof of this, at least not in full generality (see the last
paragraph of 1), although [16] show that y b
a0 = z(a, b) and hence those particular numbers
are necessarily integers by (5a). in the next section we demonstrate the integrality of all
y c

there is no unique solution to the various constraints: e.g. [16] shows that provided
simple-currents are present, there will be others. we will consider here only the standard
klein bottle of [8], given above.

3. the open string when n is odd

this section is the heart of the paper.
for the remainder of this paper, assume the order n of t is odd. this assumption
can be rephrased as follows. write t(r) for the exponent of 2 that appears in the prime
decomposition of the rational number r: e.g. t(3.7) = 1. then n odd means that each
t(ha)  0, as well as t(c)  3.
examples of odd n occur for instance in the wzw theories su (m ) level k when both
m is odd and k is even. another large class of examples are holomorphic orbifolds (with
or without discrete torsion) by a nite group g with odd order.

the main result of this paper is the following new expression for y c
ab:

n . so up to a sign, y c

ab is a fusion coecient! similarly, we obtain the curious

p = s s g2 s =  1

(10b)

where s = diag(s(a)) and the matrix g2 is as in (6b). we will prove equations (10) in the
nal section. but rst lets explore some of their consequences.

the y c

since the s and ss in (10a) are signs, and fusion coecients are nonnegative integers,
ab will necessarily be integers.
recall the observation [16] that y b

a0 = z(a, b). then (5) become [17] the unobvious

(12a)

(12b)

putting b = 0 in (11) gives a curious fact [17]: the fusion product of  1

consists of all self-conjugate elds, each appearing with multiplicity 1!

the mobius strip and klein bottle coecients become

(b)  1

a =  1
k a = n a

0,0

(12b) is the interesting one: most curiously, it is never negative! in particular, it is now a
consequence of (11) that

k a = (cid:26) 1

if a = a
0 otherwise

(12c)

this positivity is related to an observation made in [17]: when n is odd, there are
no pseudo-real primary elds. the signs a of the coecients k a play a role in the open
string theory [1,2], and when n is odd we see they all equal +1.

as a nal result, let us prove a conjecture made in [9]. in their equation (4.38), they

nd that the combination

(13)

should equal a fusion coecient in a z2 cyclic-orbifold theory. they conjecture that for
any rcft, and any choice of signs, (13) should be a nonnegative integer.

first, note that the rst term (dropping the factor 1

2 ) is

where we use equation (18) of [15]. in order to prove the conjecture of [9], we must show
both that (14a) and (14b) are congruent mod 2, and that the absolute value of (14b) is
bounded above by (14a). their congruence mod 2 follows immediately from (11a), and
the desired inequality follows from (11b) and the triangle inequality applied to (14b).

thus, provided the order of t is odd, we have proven the conjecture of [9] that (13)

is always a nonnegative integer.

the assumption that the order n of t is odd, is vital for the interpretation involving

it would be very interesting to nd interpretations `a la (10) for the other integral
 nag of the fusion ring. this should involve the twisted

4. examples

in this section we work out the relevant quantities for two wzw examples. the
wzw model for su (m ) level k has primaries most conveniently denoted by m -tuples of
nonnegative integers which sum to k.

consider rst the wzw model for su (3) at level 2. there are 6 primaries: (2,0,0) (the
vacuum 0), (0,2,0) and (0,0,2) (the two nontrivial simple-currents), and (1,1,0), (1,0,1)
and (0,1,1). the matrix t is diag(2, 8, 8, 2, 2, 7) where  = exp[2i/15], so its order
is n = 15. the matrix s here equals

for our other example, consider su (3) at level 4. there are 15 primaries, and the
vacuum is 0 = (4, 0, 0). the matrix t has order n = 21. the sign s(0) is +1, while
 1

(0) = +1 and  1

as can be veried explicitly by [18].

we conclude this paper with the derivation of equations (10). this is similar to some

th := g 1
the galois automorphism 2. the integral matrix c is unchanged, and t , being a diagonal
matrix with roots of 1 down the diagonal, gets sent to t 2. using (6b), we get
