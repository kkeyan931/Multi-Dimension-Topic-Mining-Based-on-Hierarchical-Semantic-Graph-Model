abstract

in the framework of a gauge invariant continuous and non-perturbative regular-
ization scheme based on the smearing of point like interactions by means of cuto
functions, we show that the axial anomaly, though cuto independent, depends on
the shape of the cuto functions. the standard value for the strength of the axial
anomaly is recovered if we assume that the regularized gauge invariant axial current is
in addition local.

1 introduction

since its discovery fty years ago [1], and its recognition as an intrinsic feature of the regu-
larization of gauge theories in qft [2, 3], the multiple properties of the axial anomaly were
extensively studied. as we know, if a subtracting regularization scheme is used in perturba-
tion theory, like for example the pauli-villars regularization [4], the axial anomaly is nite at
the one loop order, and its value is determined only once one has decided which symmetry
must be preserved. this is due to the fact that the integral associated to the triangular
feynman diagram is linear divergent, and hence its nite part becomes ambiguous because
it depends of the shift of the loop momentum integration variable [3]. it is in this sense
that jackiw [5] emphasized recently that the axial anomaly is an example which shows that
radiative corrections can be nite, but undetermined in qft. we show in the framework
of qed that the undetermined nature of the axial anomaly gets stronger, if we use a con-
tinuous and non-perturbative gauge invariant regularization based of the smearing of point
like interactions by means of cuto functions [6]. it comes out that at one loop order the
form of the axial anomaly is the standard one, but its strength depends on the shape of the
cuto functions if strict locality for the regularized axial current is not assumed. in order
to derive this result we calculate directly the greens function hj 
5 (q)a(k1)a(k2)i relative
to the transition amplitude of the axial current j 
5 (q) to two photons in momentum space
starting from the regularized equations of motion of qed.

2 the divergence of the axial current

first of all we recall briey the main features of the non-perturbative regularization scheme
under consideration [6]. the regularized action is

s(, , a) = z dk (k)(cid:16)2

1(k)k/  m(cid:17) (k)  ez dpd p (p)a(p  p)(p, p)(p)

xn=0

(ie)(n+2)

(n+2)! z dkdpd p (p)kn+2(k, p, p)(p) + sgauge,

(2.1)

where we have used the notation dp for dp/(2)4. the fermionic part of the action is the
sum of three terms and is regularized in a gauge invariant manner with the help of the cuto
functions i(k)  i(k2/2) whose asymptotic forms are

lim


i(k, ) = 1.

(2.2)

apart from the fact that in euclidian space the uv cuto functions must be positive and
rapid decreasing functions of the squared momenta their form is quite arbitrary. the rst
term which is the free electron kinetic term, gives the expression of the regularized free

1

electron propagator. the second term can be deduced from the standard non-regularized
electron photon interaction if we substitute the bare vertex  by
(pp)2 (cid:16)2

(p, p) = 3(p  p)h2(p)2(p)(p  p) + (pp)

(2.3)

1(p)p/  2

1(p)p/(cid:17)i .

by construction (p, p) contains a transverse part relative to the momentum p  p, which
is proportional to (p  p), where

the third term is dened by the kernel

(q) =   q/ q
q2 .

kn+2(k, p, p) = fn+2(p  k, k  p)2

1(k)k/ + i(n + 2)z dq 3(q)a(q)(q)

fn+1(p  k, k  q  p)2(k)2(k  q)

fn+1(p, q) = iz dr 3(r) r

r2 (fn(p  r, q)  fn(p, q  r)) a(r),

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

with f0(p, q) = ((2)4)2 (p)(q). this term which describes an innite set of interactions
between two electrons and any number of photons (at least two), ensures that the vertices
of each n-photons amplitude are automatically constructed with the matrices (2.4) and
hence are transverse relative to the external photon momenta. finally sgauge is the sum of
the standard non-regularized photon kinetic term, of the gauge xing terms, and of a new
interaction which is quadratic in the photon elds. the new term which is proportional to the
ne structure constant  plays the role of a counterterm for the polarization operator which
shows a quadratic divergence in its transverse part in this regularization scheme. moreover
this term which is needed to x the value of the photon mass is non-renormalized by higher
order radiative corrections and can be absorbed in the photon propagator [6].

now we are able to calculate the divergence of the axial current. from the regularized
equation of motion hs(, , a)/ (p) + (p)i = 0 which is deduced from the translational
invariance of the regularized partition function of qed in presence of the external sources
,  and j for the electron and photon elds, we rst deduce the vacuum expectation
value of the electron eld in presence of the external sources. then, the derivation of this
latter expression with respect to the external sources, allows to express the greens function
hj 
5 (q)a(k1)a(k2)i as

where d(p) is the photon propagator. here we must stress that this result was obtained in
two steps. the rst term of (2.7), gives an expression similar to (2.8), but with the matrices
(k1) and (k2) replaced respectively by their non transverse counterparts (p+k1, p) and
(p + k1, p  q) 1. it is only when we take into account the second term of (2.7) that the non
transverse part of the vertices associated to the external photons lines cancel algebraically
after some judicious shift of integration variable. we dene the 1pi function 
associated
to the greens function (2.8) as

(k1, k2).

(2.9)

in the same way we dene also the 1pi function 
a(k1)a(k2)i, where j5(q) is the fourier transform of the pseudoscalar density 5. owing
to the transversality property of the matrices (2.4), we see directly by inspection, that the
amplitude 

(2.9) is transverse with regard to the external photons lines, i.e.

(2.10)

notice that due to the gauge invariant regularization used, the structure of the 1pi function
(2.9) which is represented by the triangular diagram of fig. 1 can also be deduced in a
straightforward manner, if we impose from the beginning the conditions (2.10).

1this expression converges formally to the standard non regularized triangle amplitude when the cuto

tends to innity.

is the axial current conserved as well? if we contract the two members of the relation

now some remarks have to be made. 1) from the property (2.2) we obtain the standard
linearly divergent piece of the amplitude (k1 + k2)
[7] which induces the axial anomaly if
we formally interchange the limit with the integral symbol. 2) the pseudotensorial structure
of the rst term of (2.13) implies that the two regularized integrals on the right-hand side
of (2.13) do not vanish only because the product of the cuto functions is a function of
both the external momenta k1 and k2. 3) the rst term on the right hand-side of (2.13) is
independent of m because its derivative with respect to m is nite and zero. 4) the rst term
on the right hand-side of (2.13) vanishes as k1 = 0 or k2 = 0. therefore, if we parametrize
respectively the shape of the uv cuto functions 1(k)  (ak2/2) and 2(k)  (bk2/2)
by two real numbers a and b, it follows from dimensional analysis and from the requirement
of lorentz invariance that the right-hand side of (2.13) is given by

(k1 + k2)

5

(k1, k2) = i e2

22 c(a, b)k1k2 + 2m

5 (k1, k2),

(2.15)

where c(a, b) is a dimensionless and nite real function. moreover if we rescale the parameters
a and b respectively by as and bs, where s is a real constant, it is easy to see from (2.13),
(2.14) and (2.15) that c(as, bs) = c(a, b). this implies that we can write

c(a, b)  c(x),

(2.16)

x being the ratio b/a. the fact that the function c(a, b) is an homogeneous function of zeroth
order with respect to the real variables a and b, shows that the strength of the axial anomaly
(2.15) which is due to the regularization of an evanescent operator is sensitive to the relative
shape of the cuto functions, but is independent of the rescaling of the cuto . next we
show that this is indeed the case.

we choose for example the following cuto functions

1(p) = ea

p2
2 ,

2(p) = eb

p2
2 ,

(2.17)

whose shape is parametrized by the real positive numbers a and b. in addition the signature
of the euclidian metric is taken as (1.  1.  1.  1). if we suppose that

b

a > 3

2

(2.18)

then the function d(p) can be substituted by 1/(p2  m2) without changing the result of the
integration since the product of the cuto functions is proportional to exp(p2(4b  6a)/2)
in the integral on the right hand-side of (2.13). in this case we can perform an analytical
calculation 2, and we obtain for the function (2.16),

2 the integrals necessary to the calculation are listed in the appendix of [6].

c(x) = x2
4x6.

(2.19)

5

the point of discontinuity of the function (2.19) reects the fact that the integral on the
right hand-side of (2.13) is not regularized in the limit of exact vanishing electron mass when
the value of the ratio x is 3/2.

since the rst piece on the right hand-side of (2.13) is regularized for all positives values
of a and b and since the function c(a, b) is independent of m, it is worth to notice that, even
though the result (2.19) was derived under the condition (2.18), this result holds for any
positive values of x. it follows from (2.19) that the strength of the axial anomaly is not xed
if the relative shape of the cuto functions is not constrained. we recover the standard one
loop value e2/(2)2 for the coupling constant of the axial anomaly when the function (2.19)
veries

c(x) = 1,

(2.20)

i.e. when the ratio x of the shapes of the cuto functions is constrained by the condition
x = 4
3.

is the result (2.15) specic to the regularization used? can we understand the physical
meaning of the condition (2.20)? in order to answer these questions we study the structure
of the regularized axial current.

if it is not regularized, the remaining part of i 
contains two kinds of uv divergences.
the rst divergence is linear and comes from the term containing the function g(p, k1, k2).
this divergence is reduced to the sum of a logarithmtic one, which is proportional to the
asymptotic form (k1  k2) r dp /p4, and of a constant which depends on the shape of
the cuto functions. the second divergence which comes from the expression in the brackets
is purely logarithmtic, and is induced by the asymptotic forms (k1  k2) r dp p2/p6 and
k1 r dp pp/p6 + k2 r dp pp/p6. because the two kind of divergences cancel
each other in the regularized form (3.4), it follows that the term i 
is indeed nite. finally
when the cuto functions (2.17) obey the condition (2.18) we get the analytical expression
for the complete amplitude

5

now we show that the expression of the amplitude (3.6) is quite general, in the sense that
its form is unchanged when the value of the factor c(a, b) is not constrained by the condition
(2.18).

from the property g(p, k1, k2) = g(p, k2, k1), it follows that the nite cuto dependent
part of the integral  r dp g(p, k1, k2)p is proportional to (k1  k2). then, if we
compare the divergence of the axial current obtained from (3.6) with the general expression
(2.15), we conclude that the factor c(a, b) which enters in a1 (3.8) and a2 (3.9) is just the
factor c(a, b) entering in (2.15). finally the requirement of gauge invariance implies that the
factor c(a, b) which enters in a4 (3.11) and a5 (3.12), is again the general factor c(a, b) of
(2.15). we can notice that the factors a4 and a5, are similar to the nite factors obtained
by rosenberg [8] with dimensional arguments, if and only if the value of the factor c(a, b) is
one (2.20). in this case, the axial anomaly (2.15) has the standard numerical value and the
contribution (3.3) of i 
vanishes formally as the cuto
goes to innity and is thus due to the contribution of an evanescent operator, the fact that
the axial anomaly can be undetermined is directly related to the non uniform convergence
of the regularized integrals, as we will now see.

vanishes. since the integral i

4 discussion

in perturbation theory the amplitudes are in general regularized through the regulariza-
tion of individual feynman diagrams. if we dene the standard non regularized amplitude

(p, k1, k2), we know from [3] that the dierence of two non regularized
triangle graphs, which dier only from a shift of integration variable, is given by

the term on the right-hand side arises from a surface term when the remaining integral is
evaluated symmetrically. this term which induced the anomaly is undetermined because it
contains the arbitrary real constants a and b. thus if we regularize the amplitude 
by
subtracting the divergence [9] from its integrand, the undetermined contribution to the nite
part reected by (4.1), is suppressed if we impose a symmetry condition like for instance
gauge invariance. since, due to dimensional arguments the ai for i  3 are nite [8], this
method is equivalent to x uniquely, by the requirement of gauge invariance, the nite part
of a1 and a2 [8] without any kind of regularization. the net result is that one obtains the
standard numerical value for the axial anomaly. as we have seen, the conclusion is dierent
when we start with regularized amplitudes by means of cuto functions.

5

the reason is the following. suppose that we regularize the standard triangle graph by
hand by substituting the free electron propagator s(p) by s(p)(p), where (p) is a cuto
function of the kind (2.17) 5. then the regularized amplitude

5reg(k1, k2)  z dp a


5

(p, k1, k2, )

(4.2)

2 and 1/k2

is nite, non gauge invariant and given by (3.6) if we suppress respectively the term pro-
portional to 1/k2
1 in (3.11) and (3.12). it follows that the regularized form of the
left-hand side of (4.1) is now zero because the two integrals are invariant under a change
of variable. since lim a
(p, k1, k2), the discrepancy between the
two results for the left hand-side of (4.1) is a consequence of the non uniform convergence
of the regularized integrals. in this case the fact that the triangle graph is undetermined is
not due to the shift of integration variable, but to the arbitrary choice which we can make
for the cuto functions. is the strength of the axial anomaly xed by gauge invariance in a
regularization based on the introduction of cuto functions in momentum space?

(p, k1, k2, ) = a

5

5

the structure of the 1pi function 

(3.6) associated to the regularized triangular
diagram is general and is independent of the regularization scheme. the conditions which
are necessary for the gauge invariance of the regularized amplitude (3.6) are [8]

5

a1(k1, k2) = k1k2a3(k1, k2) + k2
a2(k1, k2) = k1k2a6(k1, k2) + k2

2a4(k1, k2)
1a5(k1, k2).

(4.3)

it follows that there are two possibilities in order to regularize the triangular diagram in a
gauge invariant manner.

1) only the factors a1 and a2 which enter the conditions (4.3) are functions of the
parameters which dene the shapes of the cuto functions. this is the case in perturbation
theory, where each diagram is regularized independently by multiplying the free propagators

5such a method was used in order to regularize the divergence of the axial current in [11] in a non gauge

invariant manner.

9

or the free vertices by suited cuto functions. then the conditions (4.3) of gauge invariance
impose that these parameters must verify a relation similar to (2.20). if the overall cuto
function which regularized the analogue of the integrals (3.4,2.14) depends on more than
one parameter, then the equation (2.20) can have a solution. the strength of the axial
anomaly is then xed to its standard value by the requirement of gauge invariance. in this
case it is worth to notice that in general only the triangle graph is regularized in a gauge
invariant manner, but not the other diagrams. 2) by adding an evanescent operator we
allow the factors a3, a6, or the factors a4, a5 to depend also on the parameters of the
cuto functions. in this case the requirement of gauge invariance (4.3) xes the structure
of the former factors in terms of the parameters of the cuto functions, but does not imply
any supplementary constraints for these parameters. as a result the strength of the axial
anomaly stays undetermined.

it is just the second possibility which is realized when we use a gauge invariant non-
perturbative regularization scheme based on the smearing of the point like interaction by
the introduction of cuto functions. in this case the relations (4.3) are fullled at the onset
without any supplementary constraints for the parameters of the cuto functions, because
now a4 (3.11) and a5 (3.12) contain a term which is proportional to (1  c(a, b)). these
terms are induced by the regularization which is used and arise from the contributions (3.3)
to the regularized amplitude 
(3.1) of the integrals (3.2) which vanish formally when
the cuto tends to innity. the contributions (3.3) of the evanescent operators (3.2) to the
regularized axial current dened by (2.9) can be expressed in operator language in terms of
the dual f   f/2 as

2 =  e2

42 (1  c(a, b)) (f  

2 a).

(4.4)

this current is conserved, explicitly gauge dependent and non local. in addition to gauge
invariance, if we impose that the regularized axial current j 
5 must be local, the function
(2.16) must verify the constraint (2.20). therefore the strength of the axial anomaly is xed
uniquely to its standard value if the regularized axial current is gauge invariant and strictly
local.

can we understand the result (2.15,3.6) by comparison with other gauge invariant regu-

larization scheme?

if we exclude dimensional regularization which is in some sense too formal and not
adapted to feynman diagrams containing the 5 matrix, we rst study the connection with
pauli-villars regularization. in this scheme the regularized fermions loops are obtained by
integration over massive regulator elds of negative norm. then, as we know, the axial
anomaly is given by [7]

(4.5)

we obtain the same result if we replace the non-regularized amplitudes (k1 + k2)
on
the right-hand side of (4.5) by their regularized form (2.15). in this case the standard value
of the axial anomaly is just given by the dierence between the amplitudes (2.15) of the
triangle graph relative to a massless electron and that of an electron with innite mass.

in lattice regularization the known result for the axial anomaly of qed is recovered if the
regularized gauge invariant action converges formally to the standard one when the lattice
spacing tends to zero and locality is assumed [10]. in fact, under these general conditions
the lattice chiral ward-takahashi identity can be taylor subtracted at zero momentum,
and then in the continuous limit the taylor subtracted lattice feynman integrals which
enter this identity are nite. this implies that the continuous limit of the taylor subtracted
lattice chiral ward-takahashi identity converges uniformly to the standard anomalous ward-
takahashi identity. notice that like in the scheme of pauli-villars, the regularization of
the continuous limit of the lattice regularization of the chiral ward-takahashi identity is
performed by subtracting the potentially divergent terms in the integrand of the lattice
feynman integrals.

5 conclusion and summary

we have shown that in a non-perturbative gauge invariant regularization scheme of qed,
where the divergences are regularized through the smearing of the point like interactions, the
divergence of the axial current can be deduced from the regularized equations of motions.
it follows that at the one loop level, the anomalous ward-takahashi identity thus obtained
is nite but depends on the shape of the cuto functions. since the latter relation is nite
one is not free to make any subtraction, if one assumes that the relevant coupling constants
which describe qed are only the charge and electron mass. this in turn implies that if a
continuous non-perturbative regularization is only restricted to preserve gauge invariance,
the axial anomaly is in general sensitive to the form of the cuto functions. like in lattice
regularization the strength of the axial anomaly is xed uniquely to its standard value if in
addition to gauge invariance strict locality is assumed for the regularized axial current. in
this case the parameters which dene the shapes of the cuto functions are constrained to
verify the strong relation (2.20). for instance, if all the cuto functions which enter in the
regularized action of qed are identical, the standard value for the axial anomaly cannot be
recovered. this feature is not seen in physical perturbative regularization schemes, even in
the continuous limit of lattice regularization, which is also perturbative, because in all these

11

methods the uv divergences are subtracted o.

in conclusion the axial anomaly in qed is only determined in a non-perturbative regu-
larization scheme if both gauge invariance and locality of the free axial current are preserved.
if locality is not assumed for this current, the strength of the axial anomaly is nite and does
not depend on the rescaling of the cuto, but depends on the shape of the cuto functions.
