abstract

we check some consistency conditions for the d9-d9 system in type i string theory.
the gravitational anomaly and gauge anomaly for so(n)  so(m) gauge symmetry are
shown to be cancelled when n  m = 32. in addition, we nd that a string theory with
u sp(n)  u sp(m) gauge symmetry also satises the anomaly cancellation conditions.
after tachyon condensation, the theory reduces to a tachyon-free u sp(32) string theory,
though there is no spacetime supersymmetry.

1 introduction

to this time, most research on d-branes in string theory has been carried out in supersymmet-

ric congurations. the bps property of branes protects the system from quantum corrections

and provides a nice perspective to go beyond perturbation in the weakly coupled regime. in

particular, the stability of the bps d-branes is one of the key properties in testing various

dualities in string theories and supersymmetric gauge theories.

however, fortunately or unfortunately, the real world is not supersymmetric, at least in the

low energy scale, and we should engage ourselves in the study of non-supersymmetric theories

sooner or later. even if one postpones consideration of the phenomenological aspects, there

are various interesting features in the non-bps congurations of branes, as should be the case,

since most of the states in string theory are non-bps.

recently, the research on the non-bps congurations of d-branes in string theory has

entered a new stage. it was discussed in refs. [1] and [2] that d-branes can be constructed as

bound states of brane-anti-brane systems and several new non-bps d-branes were found using

this construction. in this paper, we mainly consider the d9-d9 system in type i string theory.

as shown in ref. [2], lower dimensional d-branes in type i string theory can be constructed by

arranging non-trivial chan-paton bundles for the d9- and/or d9-branes. this construction

leads to an interpretation in k-theory and it has been shown that the possible d-branes in

type i string theory can be classied by ko-groups. [2]

we will check some consistency conditions for the d9-d9 system in this paper. the
gauge group of the d9-d9 system is so(n)  so(m), which is potentially anomalous. the
gravitational and mixed anomalies may also arise in this system. we will show that these
anomalies are all cancelled when n  m = 32. interestingly, there is another solution of the
anomaly cancellation conditions, which suggests the existence of a consistent d9-d9 system
with usp(n)  usp(m) gauge symmetry. after tachyon condensation, the theory reduces to
a tachyon-free usp(32) string theory, though there is no spacetime supersymmetry.

this paper is organized as follows. in 2 we analyze the eective eld theory of the d9-
d9 system. we guess the contents of massless fermions in the theory and check that the

gravitational and gauge anomalies as well as the mixed anomalies are all cancelled by the
green-schwarz mechanism. in 3, we make systematic analyses in perturbative string theory
and give some results that are consistent with the analyses given in 2. in 4, we investigate
the general formulation of the d9-d9 system and check the anomaly cancellations in stringy

1

calculations. in 5, we discuss some properties of the usp(32) string theory.

2 analyses in the eective eld theory

2.1 green-schwarz mechanism in the type i d9-d9 system

in this subsection, we determine the massless fermions in the type i d9-d9 system, imposing

the green-schwarz anomaly cancellation conditions. related analyses in the type iib d9-d9

system are given in ref. [3].

let us briey review the green-schwarz anomaly cancellation conditions in type i string
theory.[4] we consider the case in which the gauge group is so(n). the gaugino belongs to the

adjoint representation of the gauge group and contributes to the anomaly. the gravitational

anomaly cancellation requires

496 =

2

n(n  1),

(2.1)

where the right-hand side is the dimension of the adjoint representation of so(n). equation

(2.1) implies the well-known result n = 32. then the rest of the anomaly is proportional to

(tr r2)3,

1
32

tr f 2(4 tr r4 + 5(tr r2)2)

(2.2)

where f is the eld strength 2-form of so(n) and r is the curvature 2-form. one of the

important identities for the gauge anomaly cancellation is

tr f 6 = (n  32) tr f 6 + 15 tr f 2 tr f 4.

(2.3)

here we denote traces in the adjoint representation of so(n) by the symbol tr, while traces

in the fundamental representation are denoted tr. in order to cancel the gauge anomaly, the
coecient of tr f 6 on the right-hand side of (2.3) must vanish. this condition is also satised
when n = 32. then all of the terms in (2.2) are cancelled by the counterterm

 =z bx8 (cid:18)2

3

+ (cid:19)z (3l  3y )x7,

(2.4)

where b is the 2-form eld and  is an adjustable parameter. the quantity x8 is given as

x8 = tr f 4

(2.5)

we mainly follow the description in 13.5 of ref. [5].

and 3l, 3y and x7 are dened by

tr r2 = d3l,

tr f 2 = d3y ,

x8 = dx7,

modulo exact forms. the counterterm (2.4) induces an anomaly of the form

which exactly cancels the anomaly (2.2).

i12  (tr r2  tr f 2)x8,

(2.6)

(2.7)

now, consider type i string theory with n d9-branes and m d9-branes. the gauge group
is so(n) so(m). the ordinary type i string theory corresponds to the case in which n = 32
and m = 0. since several observations suggest that we can create or annihilate dp-dp pairs

without changing the physical context,[1, 2] it is natural to assume that the coecients of the
anomalies only depend on n  m. then the condition corresponding to (2.1) becomes

(2.9)

which implies n  m = 32. equation (2.9) suggests that the 9-9 fermions  and the 9-9
fermions e are positive chirality spinors, which belong to the adjoint representation of so(n)

and the second rank symmetric tensor representation of so(m), respectively, while the 9-9 or

9-9 fermions  are negative chirality spinors, which belong to the bifundamental representation
of so(n)  so(m) (table 1).

let us show that all the anomalies are cancelled when we choose these fermions. we denote

(2.15)

where we label traces in the representations of so(n) and so(m) by the subscripts 1 and

2, respectively. we denote traces in the adjoint representation of so(n) by tr1, while tr2
represents the traces in the second rank symmetric tensor representation of so(m). traces in

the fundamental representations of so(n) and so(m) are denoted tri (i = 1, 2). collecting

all the contributions of the fermions , e and , the term tr f 6 in (2.2) is replaced by

1 + tr2 f 6

tr f 6  tr1 f 6
(cid:18)6

2(cid:19) (tr1 f 2

2 ),

2

(2.16)

where the rst two terms in (2.16) are the contributions of the 9-9 fermion  and the 9-

9 fermion e, while the other terms are the contributions of the 9-9 fermion . using the
1 and tr2 f 6
identities (2.10) and (2.11), it is easy to check that the coecients of tr1 f 6
2 in
(2.16) vanish if and only if n  m = 32. similarly, tr f 4 and tr f 2 in (2.2) are replaced by

1 + tr2 f 4

2  m tr1 f 4

1  n tr2 f 4

2 ,

1 + tr2 f 2

2  m tr1 f 2

1  n tr2 f 2

then, using the identities (2.10)(2.15), the anomaly (2.2) can be written as

this anomaly can be cancelled by the counterterm

h = db + 3l  3y1 + 3y2.

(2.22)

2.2 coupling to the tachyon elds

there are tachyon elds in the d9-d9 system. after tachyon condensation, the d9-d9 brane

pairs are expected to vanish, and the eld content of the theory turns out to be the same as

4

that of type i so(32) string theory. let us show that the fermion contents given in table 1

are also suitable to explain the brane-anti-brane pair annihilation.

the tachyon elds tij belong to the bifundamental representation of so(n) so(m). we
denote i, j = 1,   , n as the vector indices of so(n) and i, j = 1,   , m as the vector indices
of so(m). the following yukawa interactions are consistent with the symmetry:

where  = t 0.

the tachyon vev is of the form

(tij) =

 32  m 

up to gauge symmetry.

it is plausible to assume that the symbols  in (2.24) are all non-
zero, although we do not know the precise form of the tachyon potential. then, the yukawa
terms (2.23) will induce mass terms for , e and ij (i > 32 or j > 32). the number of the
components of e and ij (i > 32 or j > 32) are 1
2 m(m1) + 32m, respectively,
and the sum is just enough to be paired with , which has mn = m2 + 32m components. as
a result, the massless components of the fermions after the tachyon condensation are ij
(i, j = 1,   , 32), which belong to the adjoint representation of the unbroken so(32) gauge
group, as expected.

3 analyses in string theory

3.1 physical states in the type i d9-d9 system

the d9-brane is a 9-brane with 1 units of r-r charge. it can be obtained by ipping the
sign of the r-r charge of a d9-brane. using this fact, we can compute the vacuum amplitudes

in the d9-d9 system, from which the physical spectrum can be extracted, as discussed in

ref. [1]. as a preliminary step, let us rst collect here the one-loop vacuum amplitudes for

the 9-9 strings.

[6] there are the contributions from the ns sector and the ramond sector,

5

which are denoted as z ns and z r. we decompose these terms into the contributions of ns-

ns exchange and r-r exchange in the closed string channel, denoted zns ns and zr r. we
also label the contributions from the cylinder diagram and the mobius strip diagram for the
amplitudes with superscripts as z (c2) and z (m2):

equation (3.27) is the contribution of the so(m) gauge elds, and (3.28) is the contribution

of the massless fermions. equation (3.28) suggests that the fermions belong to a second rank

symmetric tensor representation of the gauge group so(m), as discussed in the last section.

to conrm this observation in a more systematic way, note that we have taken an opposite
r r  z r (m2)
 projection in the ramond sector, which corresponds to the sign ip z r (m2)
the action of  on the massless fermions is

(3.29)

where ij = ij for so(m) theory and ij = ijij for usp(m) theory. for the ramond sector of
the 9-9 string, we take the states with  = 1 as the physical states, and thus (3.29) implies
(3.30)

e = et .

the one-loop vacuum amplitudes for 9-9 and 9-9 strings are obtained by replacing n2 with

2nm in the cylinder diagrams and ipping the sign of the contributions of the r-r exchange

between the d9-brane and d9-brane boundary states. then we have

(3.31)

(3.32)

from (3.31), we conclude that there are mn tachyon elds in the open string channel.

equation (3.32) is the contribution of mn massless fermions. it may be useful to write down
the physical state conditions for 9-9 and 9-9 strings, as given in ref. [1]. the sign ip z (c2)

z (c2)
r r means that we have taken an opposite gso projection for 9-9 and 9-9 strings, i.e.,
(1)f = 1. since we have

2 = (1)f ,

(3.33)

in the ns sector, we should take the states with  = i as physical states in the ns sector.
we choose the convention  = i in the following. since the action of  on the ns ground

state is given by

| 0; ij ins = i (9)jj  | 0; j i ins (1

9 )ii,

(3.34)

where i, i = 1,   , n are d9-brane chan-paton indices and j, j  = 1,   , m are d9-brane
in the present case, since the gauge group is the so group, we have
chan-paton indices.

(9)ii = ii and (9)jj  = jj . the tachyon eld created by the 9-9 and 9-9 strings are
combined as

t = 

tij

tij

! ,

(3.35)

which is an (n + m) (n + m) hermitian matrix. imposing the physical state condition  = i,
we have

where

t t = 1t ,

 =  9

9 ! ,

(3.36)

(3.37)

leaving nm components as the physical tachyon.

8

for the ramond sector ground states, the operator (1)f is equivalent to the chirality
operator . thus, if we take an opposite gso projection for 9-9 and 9-9 strings, the chirality

of the fermions created by these string is opposite to the chirality of 9-9 and 9-9 fermions.

this result is consistent with the anomaly cancellation conditions discussed in the previous

section.

3.2 the r-r tadpole cancellation in the type i d9-d9 system

the r-r tadpole cancellation is one of the most important constraints in a consistent string
theory. in the d9-d9 system, the r-r tadpole cancellation requires the condition n m = 32,
which we encountered in the previous section, (2.9). though this condition can be easily
understood by counting the r-r charges of d9-branes, d9-branes and an o9-plane, it would

be instructive to demonstrate the explicit calculation in our framework.

the divergences due to the r-r tadpole can be extracted by the modular transformation

in one-loop vacuum amplitudes zr r. using the identities

(it) = t1/2(i/t),

z 

 (it) = z 

(i/t),

and dening s = /t for the cylinder and s = /4t for the mobius strip, we have

3.3 the u sp(n)  u sp(m) theory
the analyses in 2 can also be applied to the case in which the gauge group is the symplec-
tic group. the 9-9 strings will create elds in the adjoint representation of usp(n), which

is equivalent to the second rank symmetric tensor representation. then, we can guess the

fermions of the theory as in table 3.

the condition corresponding to (2.9) is satised if mn = 32. in addition, if we interchange
n and m, the identities (2.10)(2.15) are also satised for the usp(n) usp(m) gauge theory,
and all the anomalies are cancelled in the manner as discussed in 2.1.

the interpretation in string theory is as follows. we ll the spacetime with n d9-branes and
m d9-branes, and we take the sp-type  projection. it is easy to repeat the analyses of 3.1
and 3.2. for example, taking into account that  in (3.29) is ij, the condition corresponding

to (3.30) is now

(3.44)

implying that the 9-9 fermions eij  jikek

is again cancelled when m  n = 32.

we can also derive this result by counting r-r charges. the sp-type  projection can
be understood as an eect of an o9+-plane lling the spacetime. in ordinary type i string
theory, there is an o9-plane, which induces the so-type  projection, and 32 d9-branes are

needed to cancel the r-r 10-form charge. in the sp-type theory, however, since the sign of
the r-r charge of the o9+-plane is opposite to that of the o9-plane, we need 32 d9-branes.

therefore, in the system with n d9-branes and m d9-branes, we must impose the condition
m  n = 32 to cancel the r-r charge.

4 general formulation of the d9-d9 system

4.1 generalization to arbitrary amplitudes

adding d9-d9 pairs in type i or type iib string theory can be understood as adding additional

open strings in the theory. we have observed from the vacuum amplitudes that the 9-9 and

9-9 strings have the opposite gso projection, and the ramond sector of the 9-9 strings have

the opposite  projection as the ordinary 9-9 strings. this observation should be conrmed

in arbitrary amplitudes, as required by the unitarity of the s-matrix.

when we compute the amplitudes in superstring theory, we must sum over spin structures

of the world-sheet. the spin structures are characterized by the boundary conditions for the

world-sheet fermions. when we move the fermions around a non-trivial cycle of the world-

sheet, the sign of the fermions can be ipped. we represent the sign ip by including a cut

in the world-sheet. the cut may end at a boundary of the world-sheet or a position where

a ramond vertex operator is inserted. there are holomorphic and anti-holomorphic sectors,

and the spin structures are chosen for each sector. if the world-sheet has no boundary, the

spin structures for the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic sectors are chosen independently.

however, if the world-sheet has boundaries, holomorphic sectors and anti-holomorphic sectors

are related at the boundaries by the open string boundary conditions. accordingly, if the cuts

end at the boundary in the holomorphic sector, the same holds in the anti-holomorphic sector.

we refer to the boundary, at which odd numbers of cuts end, as an r-r boundary.
in
3, we have assigned an extra minus sign for each r-r boundary with d9-brane chan-paton
indices in the vacuum amplitudes. this prescription can be easily generalized to the case with

arbitrary numbers of boundaries without open string vertex operators. however, a problem

may arise when there are 9-9 or 9-9 string vertex operators at a boundary of the world-sheet.

in this case, the boundary is broken into pieces with d9-brane and d9-brane chan-paton

11

indices, and it is ambiguous which sign should be assigned. in order to resolve this problem,

we propose that an extra minus sign should be assigned for each endpoint of the cut at the

boundary with d9-brane chan-paton indices. the position of the cuts can be continuously

moved without changing any physical quantities, and hence we must show that the amplitudes

are not changed when we move the cut ending at the boundary across the 9-9 or 9-9 string

vertex operators (fig. 1).

fig.1: the solid and dashed boundaries are equipped with d9 and d9-brane chan-paton
indices, respectively. we assign an extra minus sign for each endpoint of the cut at the
d9-brane boundary.

before solving this problem, let us conrm that the 9-9 and 9-9 strings have the opposite

gso projection. in the open string channel, making a cut parallel to the spatial direction of
the open string corresponds to the insertion of the operator (1)f in the operator formalism.
if the open string is a 9-9 or 9-9 string, one of the endpoints of the cut is at the d9-boundary,
and thus we should assign an extra 1 factor. therefore, in our prescription, making a cut
parallel to the spatial direction of the 9-9 or 9-9 string corresponds to the insertion of (1)f
in the operator formalism, as desired (fig. 2).

then, if the 9-9 string vertex operator in the gure is projected to satisfy the physical condition
(1)f = 1, the amplitude is equivalent to the right-hand side of fig. 1. this is the desired
result in order for the amplitudes to be invariant under continuous deformations of the cut in

the world-sheet.

next we wish to reconrm that the ramond sector of the 9-9 string has the opposite 

projection. the open string vertex operator in the ramond sector creates a cut in the world-
sheet of either the holomorphic or anti-holomorphic sector. let us consider the case in which
the vertex operator vr creates a cut in the holomorphic sector. then vr will create a cut
in the anti-holomorphic sector. in order to connect the cut consistently, it should end at the
boundary, and hence we need an extra 1 factor (fig. 4). summing up these terms, we have
the projection  = 1, as desired.

note that the cut created by the ramond sector vertex operator could be taken in the

anti-holomorphic sector. then the sign of the amplitude will be ipped. but this is not a

problem, since the overall sign of the amplitude is unphysical.

4.2 anomaly cancellations in string theory

to conrm our prescription, let us show that the gauge anomaly is cancelled in the d9-d9

system. there are three types of diagrams that contribute to the anomaly, [7, 5] planer,

non-orientable, and non-planer orientable diagrams, as depicted in figs. 57.

if necessary, we deform the cut so that it does not lie along the boundary of the world-sheet.

fig.5: planer.

fig.6: non-orientable.

fig.7: non-planer.

we consider these diagrams as open string one-loop diagrams. then, only the ramond
sector of the open strings with the (1)f insertion will contribute to the anomaly, since the
parity-conserving terms are not anomalous. as explained in refs. [7] and [5], the non-planer

diagrams are not divergent and do not contribute to the anomaly. hence we consider the sum

of the contribution from the planer and non-orientable diagrams. let us consider the case

that all the external gauge elds are created by 9-9 strings. the case with 9-9 gauge elds
can be treated similarly. the (1)f insertion will create a cut in the world-sheet, and hence
we need an extra 1 factor for each d9-brane boundary in the planer diagrams. thus the
contributions from the planer diagrams are proportional to n  m, where n and m are the
numbers of d9 and d9-branes, respectively. the explicit calculations are exactly the same as

those given in ref. [7], except for this factor. the result is

where g is a non-vanishing factor, for which we do not need detailed structure, and l is given

a = ( n  m + 32 l ) g,

(4.1)

as

l =

+1,
0,
1,

usp(n),

u(n),
so(n).

(4.2)

as a result, the anomaly is cancelled when n  m = 32 l; namely, n = m for the type iib
d9-d9 system, n m = 32 for the type i d9-d9 system, and m n = 32 for the d9-d9 system
of usp-type theory.

5 discussion of the u sp(32) theory

as the d9-d9 pairs are expected to vanish after the tachyon condensation, it is interesting to

examine the case with m = 32 and n = 0, which is the tachyon-free case. this theory contains

closed strings and open strings with usp(32) chan-paton indices. the formulation is almost

14

the same as that of the type i so(32) string theory, except we take the opposite  projection

for the ramond sector of the open strings, and accordingly, we associate an extra minus sign

for each r-r boundary of the world-sheet in calculating the amplitudes.

unlike the type i so(32) theory, the usp(32) theory does not have a spacetime super-

symmetry, since the fermion , created by the open strings, belongs to the second rank anti-

symmetric tensor representation of usp(32) and cannot be a supersymmetric partner of the

usp(32) gauge eld. therefore, there is no reason for the vacuum energy to be cancelled.

indeed, there is a divergence in the vacuum amplitude due to the ns-ns tadpole, that needs

to be cancelled by the fischler-susskind mechanism.[8] this induces the cosmological constant

term g e in the eective action.

the k-theory analyses given in ref. [2] suggest that there are d1, 3, 4, 5, 9-branes in this

theory (table 5).

the analyses in ref. [9] show that d1-branes and d5-branes have sp and so-type chan-

paton indices, respectively. we can also understand this fact using the isomorphism of k-
theory groups ksp(rn)  ko(rn4). suppose that we wish to construct lower dimensional
d-branes in the d5-d5 system, as given in refs. [1] and [2].
in order to obtain the same
d-branes as in table 5, the suitable k-group for the d5-d5 system is ko(rk), rather than
ksp(rk) (table 6).

thus, we conclude that the chan-paton indices for d5-branes are of the so-type. a similar

argument for d1-branes shows that d1-branes have sp-type chan-paton indices.

the analysis of the spectrum of open strings ending on the d1-branes is similar to the

ordinary type i d-strings, which is given in ref. [10]. consider n d1-branes lying along the
x0, x9 direction in the usp(32) string theory. note that n should be even, since the gauge

group on the d1-branes is usp(n).

1-1 strings in the ns sector create an usp(n) gauge eld a (which can be gauged away)
and eight massless scalar elds x i (i = 1,   , 8), which belong to the second rank anti-
symmetric tensor representation of the gauge group. world-sheet massless fermions created
by the 1-1 strings in the ramond sector are sa
 (a, a = 1,   , 8). the subscripts + and
 represent the chirality of the world-sheet lorentz group so(1, 1), and the superscripts a and
a are indices of the 8s and 8c spinor representations of the transverse spacetime lorentz group
so(8). sa
+ is a right-moving fermion that belongs to the adjoint representation of usp(n),
while s a
 is a left-moving fermion that belongs to the second rank anti-symmetric tensor
representation of the gauge group. 1-9 and 9-1 strings will create a left moving fermion i
(i = 1,   , 32), which belongs to the fundamental representation of usp(n). the superscript
i comes from the chan-paton indices associated with 32 d9-branes.

to investigate the detailed structure of this theory.
