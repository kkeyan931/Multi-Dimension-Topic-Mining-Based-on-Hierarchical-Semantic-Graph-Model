we give a general decomposition of su (n ) connection and derive a generalized skyrme-faddeev
action as the eective action of su (n ) qcd in the low energy limit. the result is obtained by
separating the topological degrees which describes the non-abelian monopoles from the dynamical
degree of gauge potential, and integrating all the dynamical degrees of su (n ) qcd.

i. introduction

an open question in qcd is to identify the quark connement mechanism and understand how it works. the
monopole condensation is regarded as a possible explanation for the connement of color through the dual meissner
eect [1,2]. to realize the dual scenario of the connement, t hooft proposed an abelian projection where the
gauge group is broken by a suitable gauge condition to its maximal abelian subgroup [2]. since the topology of
the su (n ) and that of its maximal abelian subgroup u (1)n 1 are dierent, any such gauge is singular, meaning
that a gauge group element which transforms a generic su (n ) connection onto the gauge xing surface is not
regular everywhere in space-time. the singularities may form worldline that are usually interpreted as worldlines of
magnetic monopoles. as a result the original yang-mills theory turns into electrodynamics with magnetic monopoles.
recent numerical simulations show that the monopole degrees of freedom in the abelian projection can indeed form
a condensation responsible for the connement [3]. however, there still has no satisfactory proof how the desired
monopole condensation could take place in qcd.

recently, there are lots of work [4,5] done for searching the mechanism of connement in yang-mills theory. one
hopes to nd the connement mechanism based on the rst principle. y. m. cho et al [4] provide a possible theoretical
mechanism of the monopole condensation in su (2) qcd. through utilizing the parametrization of the su (2) gauge
potential and choosing proper gauge, they showed that the monopole potential acquires a mass through the quantum
correction after integrating out all the dynamical degrees of the non-abelian potential.

in this paper, from the similar consideration as that of cho et al, we obtain the eective theory of su (n ) qcd
based on the rst principles. it is found that there exists mass gaps in the infra-red limit of su (n ) qcd corresponding
to dierent abelian projection parts of su (n ) connection. our result gives a connection between the generalized
non-linear model of skyrme-faddeev type and su (n ) qcd in the low energy limit. we also shows this eective
theory may have special feature at large n limit and may relate to the properties of d-brane. in order to achieve
the goal desired, we also give a general decomposition of su (n ) connection in terms of n  1 orthonormal vectors
dened by conjugating the cartan matrices by a generic su (n ) element. the su (n ) connection we give corresponds
to cho connection and faddeev-niemi connection under dierent condition.

this paper is arranged as follows. in section 2, we give the general decomposition of su (n ) connection. in section
3, the eective theory of su (n ) qcd is given. at last, from the viewpoint of background eld, we give a eective
lagrangian of skyrme-faddeev type at section 4.

ii. decomposition of su (n ) gauge potential

let m be a n-dimensional riemannian manifolds and p (, m, g) be a principal bundle with the structure group
g = su (n ). a smooth vector eld a (a = 1, 2, ..., n 2  1) can be found on the base manifold m (a section of a

vector bundle over m). the covariant derivative 1-form of a is

where aa is the connection 1-form

the curvature 2-form is dened as

da = da + f abcabc

aa = aa

dx.

the dening representation of the su (n ) lie algebra consists of n 2  1 matrices t a which satisfy

f a =

where f abc are completely antisymmetric and dabc are completely symmetric. in terms of t a, the vector eld a can
be represented as matrix form

and its covariant derivative as

 = at a

d = d  ig[a, ]

(5)

(6)

conjugating the cartan matrices hi (i = 1, 2, ..., n  1) by a generic element g  su (n ), we dene n  1 vectors

mi = ma

i t a = ghig1

which are othornormal to each other

t r(mimj) = ma

in this way, mi make up an over determined set of coordinates on the orbit su (n )/u (1)n 1. the covariant derivative

on 4-dimensional manifold, by choosing a complete basis of subspace of su(n ) lie algebra which is orthogonal to the
subspace make up by mi, the covariant part of the gauge potential (11) can be expressed as

 f abcdmb

i = ijf abcmb

and denote the non-covariant part of (11) as

serve as electric potential and c serve as magnetic potential. under the innitesimal gauge transformation

which means the lie product of x is belong to the subspace made up by mi. this condition is satised intrinsically
at su (2) gauge theory. the further analysis of this assumption will be showed in the forth coming paper.

in order to get the eective action expressed solely by the topological elds mi, we need to integrate out all the

dynamical degrees. consider the generating function for (26)

w [ji, j a

 exp[iz (

(29)

to integrate out all the dynamical degrees we need to choose a proper gauge to leave mi as a background. the
techniques we use here are similar to that were used by y. m.. cho et al [4].

firstly, we x mi as a background such that under the innitesimal gauge transformation

ma

i = 0,

to remove the quartic term of x a

take the trivial classical congurations a

in one loop approximation, by making use of the dimensional regulation, we can calculate the determinants and those

this restricted qcd action contains only the abelian projection which nevertheless has the full non-abelian gauge

where  and  are the renormalized coupling constants. this is nothing but a generalized skyrme-faddeev lagrangian
to su (n ). one can nd it is much complex than the case of su (2) qcd. we have obtained the eective action of
su (n ) qcd from the rst principles.

iv. skyrme-faddeev-like effective lagrangian of su (n ) qcd

actually, in the above procedure, we have integrated out x a

 and a separately in two steps to emphasize the
importance of the restricted theory qcd [6]. but certainly we could integrate out them simultaneously in one step
to obtain the desired eective action. for example, such a gauge

f a = aima

i + dx a

 + c a

  f a = 0

(49)

is a kind of suitable choice. in this case, the nal result is basically similar. furthermore, to study our problem
conveniently, seeking a suitable gauge is very meaningful as will be shown in the following.

in our decomposition, one could regard c a

 either as a covariant multiplet or simply as a xed background. the

rst point of view provides an active type by (48), but the second point of view gives the following passive type.

fix the gauge with the condition

f a = d(aima

i  c a

)  f a = 0

which d is dened only by c a

. the lagrangian of ghost is

lgf = 

1
2

[(a)2 + ( dx a

so with () the generating function is

w [j, j a

(50)

where c and c are ghost elds. in one loop approximation, the x a
functional determinations (with  = 1)

 and the ghost elds integrations give the following

after renormalization the nal eective lagrangian can be written as

which is similar to the lagrangian faddeev and niemi expect [7]. this is just the skyrme-faddeev-like lagrangian
which allows the topological knot solutions. our solutions shows there exist connection between the generalized
non-linear sigma model of skyrme-faddeev type and su (n ) qcd.

in the above discussion, we construct the eective theory for su (n ) qcd. our analysis shows, just like su (2)
qcd, there exist the mass gaps corresponding to mi in the infra-red limit of qcd based on the rst principles. the
monopole condensation can serve as the physical mechanism for the connement of color in su (n ) qcd. however,
one can nd the mass gotten for dierent mi are the same. the reason is that we choose only one gauge condition
(43) for all mi. alternatively, one can choose n gauge condition for every mj = n such as

2j = ajna + f abc2mb
f a

i mc

i  f2 = 0

then n dierent mass j are obtained and the mass term of the eective lagrangian becomes



2
j

(ma

j )2.

(56)

(57)

when calculating the yang-mills lagrangian, we assume (28) to remove a cross term. this assumption may be
superuous and do not aect the eective lagrangian we obtain too much for it involves only the covariant parts of
the gauge potential.

the result gotten in section 3 is not the same as that gotten in section 4. the reason is the dierent choices of gauge
condition. we notice an important feature of the former is that when n  , some special terms of the lagrangian
(48) manifest their importances and the others can be ignored

we still dont know what problem it will cause. but we think it is crucial at the large n cases, and may relate to some
properties of d-brane. and we believe the last term in above lagrangian will give rise to many interesting physical
eects.
