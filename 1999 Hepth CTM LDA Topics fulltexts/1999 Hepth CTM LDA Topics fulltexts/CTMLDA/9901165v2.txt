abstract

based on a generalization of the stochastic quantization scheme recently a modied faddeev-
popov path integral density for the quantization of yang-mills theory was derived, the mod-
ication consisting in the presence of specic f inite contributions of the pure gauge degrees
of freedom. due to the gribov problem the gauge xing can be dened only locally and the
whole space of gauge potentials has to be partitioned into patches. we propose a global path
integral density for the yang-mills theory by summing over all patches, which can be proven to
be manifestly independent of the specic local choices of patches and gauge xing conditions,
respectively. in addition to the formulation on the whole space of gauge potentials we discuss the
corresponding global path integral on the gauge orbit space relating it to the original parisi-wu
stochastic quantization scheme and to a proposal of stora, respectively.

the faddeev-popov [1] path integral procedure constitutes one of the most popular

quantization methods for yang-mills theory and is widely used in elementary particle

physics. it is, however, well known that at a non perturbative level due to the gribov

ambiguity [2] a unique gauge xing in the full space of gauge elds is not possible so that

the faddeev-popov path integral procedure is dened only locally in eld space.

several attempts were presented to generalize the above approach in order to establish

global integral representations. we especially point out the construction of a regularized

feynmankac functional integral by [3], the use of equivariant cohomological techniques

by [4] and the method of implementing brst invariance globally by [5].

it is our aim to present a quite dierent argumentation based on a recently introduced

generalization [6, 7] of the stochastic quantization scheme [8, 9, 10].

let p (m, g) be a principal ber bundle with compact structure group g over the
compact euclidean space time m. let a denote the space of all irreducible connections
on p and let g denote the gauge group, which is given by all vertical automorphisms on
p reduced by the centre of g. then g acts freely on a and denes a principal g-bration
a  a/g =: m over the paracompact [11] space m of all inequivalent gauge potentials
with projection . due to the gribov ambiguity the principal g-bundle a  m is not
globally trivializable.

from [11] it follows that there exists a locally nite open cover u = {u} of m

together with a set of background gauge elds {a()

 = {b  1(u)|d

(b  a()

with respect to a()

the original eld space a we consider the family of trivial principal g-bundles   g 
, which are locally isomorphic to the bundle a  m, where the isomorphisms are
provided by the maps

with b  , g  g and bg denoting the gauge transformation of b by g.

using this mathematical setting we start with the parisiwu approach for the stochas-

tic quantization of the yangmills theory in terms of the langevin equation

da =

ds + dw.

(3)

here s denotes the yangmills action without gauge symmetry breaking terms and with-

out accompanying ghost eld terms, s denotes the extra time coordinate with respect to

which the stochastic process is evolving, dw is the increment of a wiener process.

making use of the ito stochastic calculus we locally transform the langevin equation

tangent vector in tgg back to the identity idg on g, prg is the projector  g  g. we
recall furthermore that a admits a natural metric which gives rise to an induced metric

the fokkerplanck equation associated to (4) can easily be deduced and its (non-

normalized) equilibrium distribution is obtained as [7]

 estot

 ,  =qdet g.

(7)

3

it is the basic idea of the stochastic quantization scheme to interpret an equilibrium

limit of a fokkerplanck distribution as euclidean path integral measure. although our

result implies unconventional f inite contributions along the gauge group (arising from

the pr

gsg term) it is equivalent to the usual faddeevpopov prescription for yang

mills theory. this follows from the fact that for expectation values of gauge invariant

observables these contributions along the gauge group are exactly canceled out due to

the normalization of the path integral, see below. we stress once more that due to the

gribov ambiguity the usual faddeevpopov approach as well as -presently- our modied

version are valid only locally in eld space.

in order to compare expectation values on dierent patches we consider the dieo-

morphism in the overlap of two patches

12 : (11(u2))g  (21(u1))g
here 2 : 1(u2)  g is uniquely dened (see [7]) by a2 (a)1  2. to the density
 there is associated a corresponding twisted top form on g (see e.g. [12]) which for
simplicity we denote by the same symbol. using for convenience a matrix representation

12(b, g) := (b2 (b)1

, g). (8)

of g [7] we straightforwardly verify that


12 2 = 1 .

(9)

this immediately implies that in overlap regions the expectation values of gauge invariant
observables f  c (a) are equal when evaluated in dierent patches

suppose now that we consider a dierent locally nite cover {u 

a new set of background gauge elds {a()
as well as new maps 

, densities

and another partition of unity


 are given. applying the above integration formula in overlap regions we can prove

furthermore that

finally we propose the denition of the global expectation value of a gauge invariant
observable f  c (a) by summing over all the partitions  such that

hfi = p rg

(12)

(for a preliminary presentation of this result see [13]). due to (9) it is trivial to prove
that the global expectation value hfi is independent of the specic choice of the locally
nite cover {u}, of the choice of the background gauge elds {a()
0 } and of the choice
of the partition of unity , respectively.

as already indicated in [7] these structures can equally be translated into the original
eld space a. with the help of the partition of unity the locally dened densities  as
well as estot
 can be pieced together to give a globally well dened twisted top form 
on a

(13)

(14)

the global expectation value (12) then reads

 :=x

1 



( estot

 ).

hfi = ra  f
ra 

which due to the discussion from above is independent of all the particular local choices.

in addition to the global expressions (12) and (14) for the path integral in the whole

space of connections the stochastic quantization scheme also oers the possibility of
deriving the corresponding formulation on the gauge orbit space m: we consider the
projections of either the original parisiwu langevin equation (3) or of the modied

equation (4) onto the gauge invariant subspaces  described by the coordinate b; in

both cases we obtain (see [7])

db ="(g1

(15)

notice that in local coordinates (g1
 ) is the pullback of the restriction on u of
the inverse of a globally dened metric on the gauge orbit space m induced by the
natural metric on a. since the locally dened equations (15) are transforming covariantly

5

under the local dieomorphisms issued by the coordinate transformations, using [14] it
is straightforward to check that their further projections onto m are yielding a globally
dened stochastic process.

in direct analogy to our derivation of the local fokkerplanck densities (7) we obtain

that the fokkerplanck equation associated to the projected langevin equations (15) has

an equilibrium distribution given by just the gauge invariant part of the densities (7)

det f (det a()

)1/2 e

s.

(16)

by using (9) we can prove explicitly that their projections onto m on overlapping sets
of u agree giving rise to a globally well dened top form  on m. furthermore we can
show that the above expectation values (12) and (14) of gauge invariant observables f
can identically be rewritten as corresponding integrals over the gauge orbit space m with
respect to 

we note that this last expression shows agreement with the formulation proposed by
stora [4] upon identication of  with the ruelle-sullivan form [15]. whereas in [4],
however, this denition of expectation values on m appeared as the starting point for a
global formulation of yang-mills theory in the whole space of gauge potentials it appears

now as our nal result.

we directly aimed at the derivation of a global path integral formulation in the whole

space of gauge potentials within the stochastic quantization approach; we recall that
we rst derived a path integral in terms of the local probability density  estot

 which

assured gaussian decrease along the gauge xing surface as well as along the gauge orbits.
the inherent interrelation of the eld variables on   g subsequently led to simple
relations of the local densities in the overlap regions and eventually to the global path

integral formulations (12) and (14) on the whole eld space, as well as to (17) on the

gauge orbit space, respectively.

it is remarkable that the projections onto the local gauge xing surfaces  of in spe-

cic the original parisiwu stochastic process induce a globally dened stochastic process

on the gauge orbit space yielding the construction of the globally dened path integral
density . in our opinion this relationship of the globally dened parisiwu langevin

equation on the whole eld space to the globally dened path integral density on the

gauge orbit space closes nicely one of the left open issues of the original paper [8].

we are aware that in a mathematically strict sense our results are rather formal due

to the infrared and ultraviolet innities inherent in the path integral; it seems challenging

to investigate the applicability of a previously developed stochastic regularization scheme

[16] within our generalized approach.
