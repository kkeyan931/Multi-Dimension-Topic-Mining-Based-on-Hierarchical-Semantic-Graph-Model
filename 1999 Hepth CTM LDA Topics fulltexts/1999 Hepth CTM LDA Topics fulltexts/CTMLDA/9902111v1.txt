1 introduction

this paper is about the metric on the moduli space of (2, 1)-monopoles. this metric is
calculated and examined. a (2, 1)-monopole is a solution of the su(3) bogomolny equation

di = bi,

(1.1)

where di is the adjoint representation su(3) covariant derivative and bi is a nonabelian
magnetic eld which is the hodge dual of the su(3) eld strength. the higgs eld  is
a scalar eld transforming under the adjoint representation of su(3). the higgs eld at
innity is required to lie in the gauge orbit of

 ,

where s1 + s2 + s3 = 0 and, by convention, s1 < s2 < s3. this condition on  gives a map
from the large sphere at innity into the quotient space

orbitsu(3) = su(3)/u(1)2.

(1.3)

since 2(su(3)/u(1)2) = z2 the moduli space of monopoles is divided into sectors labelled
by two topological charges, k1 and k2, and a monopole with these charges is called a (k1, k2)-
monopole. these charges appear in the asymptotic expansion of . for large r = |x|, 
lies in the gauge orbit of

(k1, 0)-monopoles are embeddings of k1-monopoles; su(2) monopoles with topological
charge k1. the embedding is essentially the trivial embedding of su(2) into the upperleft
2  2 block of su(3) [2]. the mass of a (k1, 0)-monopole is 4mk1 where

in the same way, (0, k2)-monopoles are k2-monopoles with the su(2) embedded into the
bottomright 2  2 block of su(3). the mass of a (0, k2)-monopole is 4mk2 where

m = s2  s1.

(1.5)

m = s3  s2.

(1.6)

in this way there are two dierent types of su(3) monopoles, one type corresponding
to each u(1). a (k1, 0)-monopole or a (0, k2)-monopole is made up of only one type
of monopole and behaves like the corresponding su(2) monopole. a (k1, k2)-monopole
has mass 4(k1m + k2m). it is not unreasonable to think of a (2, 1)-monopole as being
composed of two monopoles of one type and one of another.

bps monopoles interact in dierent ways depending on whether they are of the same
type or of dierent types. the metric on the moduli space of two su(3) monopoles of
dierent type, the (1, 1)-monopole, is the taub-nut metric [8, 14, 31]. this metric can be
derived from physical arguments since it is the kinetic lagrangian for the electromagnetic
and scalar interactions of point dyons. the metric for a (2, 0)-monopole, that is an su(3)
monopole with two monopoles of the same type, is the atiyah-hitchin metric. this is
the metric on the moduli space of a 2-monopole. when the monopoles are far apart the
metric is exponentially close to a taub-nut metric which can be interpreted as the kinetic
lagrangian for point dyons. when the monopoles are not far apart, their interactions can
not be understood in this way. the metric on the moduli space of (2, 1)-monopoles mixes
these interaction types.

in this paper the metric on the moduli space of (2, 1)-monopoles is calculated from
nahm data. nahm data are solutions to nonlinear matrix equations in a single variable
s  (s1, s3]. the moduli space of (2, 1) nahm data is dieomorphic to the moduli space of
(2, 1)-monopoles. the calculation done in this paper is of the metric on the moduli space
of (2, 1) nahm data. this is assumed to be equivalent to calculating the metric on the
monopole moduli space. we will refer to this moduli space as m(2,1).
the calculation is complicated and the resulting metric is not transparent. nonetheless
it is possible to examine geodesic submanifolds of the moduli space. by examining how the
monopoles behave in these submanifolds it is possible to infer properties of the monopole
interactions. this is explained in section 5.2.

during the calculation of the metric itself it is useful to consider some aspects of the cor-
responding physical picture. the metric on the moduli space is the kinetic lagrangian for
three interacting monopoles of two dierent types. it is possible to distinguish monopoles
of dierent types and it is also possible to think of the two dierent monopole types sep-
arately. as explained below, each type corresponds to separate, though interdependent,
parts of the nahm data. there is a (2, ) part of the nahm data with s  (s1, s2] and a
( , 1) part with s  [s2, s3]. it is possible to think of these parts of the nahm data as corre-
sponding to dierent part of the (2, 1)-monopole, a ( , 1)-monopole and a (2, )-monopole.
the ( , 1) nahm data are very simple; they consist of coordinates for the ( , 1)-monopole.
the conditions on the nahm data include a matching condition at s = s2. because of this
matching condition, the precise form of the (2, ) nahm data depends on the ( , 1) nahm
data. this means the precise shape of the (2, )-monopole depends on the position of
the ( , 1)-monopole. in fact, the further away the ( , 1)-monopole is, the more the (2, )-
monopole resembles a (2, 0)-monopole.

what is remarkable is that up to group transformations, each (2, )-monopole congura-
tion corresponds to an ellipsoid of ( , 1)-monopole positions. in other words, the matching
condition and gauge structure of the nahm data is such that for a given class of gauge
equivalent (2, ) nahm data there is an ellipsoid of ( , 1) nahm data. however, though
each (2, )-monopole on this ellipsoid is equivalent, the corresponding (2, 1)-monopoles are
all dierent since the ( , 1)-monopole is in a dierent position in each. this dierence
disappears in the limit where the ( , 1)-monopole mass, m, is zero. if m = 0 the stabiliser
of the asymptotic higgs eld (1.2) is su(2)u(1). this is the case of nonabelian residual

3

symmetry. this picture of nonabelian residual symmetry as a massless limit of the abelian
residual symmetry is due to lee, weinberg and yi [32].

in the massless case, there is only one topological charge; there is also a holomorphic
charge which is preserved because of the complex structure. the holomorphic charge
counts the number of massless monopoles. we will distinguish between holomorphic and
topological charges by putting holomorphic charges in square brackets; in this notation the
m = 0 limit of a (2, 1)-monopole is a (2, [1])-monopole. in this space of (2, [1])-monopoles
repositioning the notional ( , 1)-monopole position is an isometry. in fact, this repositioning
combined with the phase of the ( , 1)-monopole constitutes an su(2) isometric action on
the (2, [1])-monopole moduli space.

the metric on this moduli space is calculated by dancer in [9]. it is a twelve-dimensional
moduli space. these twelve dimensions can be interpreted as four dimensions parameter-
ising the overall centre of mass and position of the monopole, three dimensions for the
su(2) isometry, three for the so(3) orientation and nally two dimensions usually called
the separation and cloud parameters. these last two parameters describe the separation of
the two massive monopoles and the distance from these to the ellipsoid of notional massless
monopole positions. this ellipsoid is often called the cloud.

the (2, 1) metric can be calculated in two parts. the rst part is due to the (2, )-
monopole. this metric includes the eects of the ( , 1)-monopole on the (2, )-monopole
but does not include the ( , 1)-monopole itself. the second part of the metric is due to
the ( , 1)-monopole. this is described in section 2. first the nahm data are introduced
along with the groups acting on them. gauge-invariant coordinates on m(2,1) are then
dened from the nahm data and a set of one-forms dened from the exterior derivatives
of these coordinates. tangent vectors dual to these one-forms are calculated and the
metric expressed in terms of the tangent vectors. the calculation of the explicit metric is
presented in section 3. in section 4.1 another way of calculating the metric is discussed
which implements the physical description given above in a very clear way. in this section
the hyperkahler quotient construction is used to construct the metric on m(2,1) from the
direct product of the (2, [1])-monopole and 1-monopole metrics.
section 4 contains a detailed discussion of the hyperkahler quotient construction in
the context of the (2, 1) metric. in section 5 we derive certain properties of the moduli
space using rational maps. as mentioned above, section 5 also contains an investigation of
the geodesic submanifolds of m(2,1) which correspond to sets of monopole congurations
with extra symmetry. two asymptotic limits of the metric are calculated in section 6;
in section 6.1 the asymptotic expression is calculated for large ( , 1)-monopole separation
and in section 6.2 the point dyon metric is discussed. section 7 contains concluding
remarks. we explain that we were motivated by two possible applications; hanany-witten
theory and the calculation of the approximate metric for the su(2) three-monopole with
two monopoles close together and one far away. it is also noted that there is an obvious
variation on previous calculations, the ([1], 2, [1])-monopole metric for su(4) monopoles.
this metric is calculated in section 8.

1.1 notation and conventions

the calculations involve the use of dierent indices running over dierent ranges. the
following conventions are used. latin indices i, j and k run from one to three. greek
indices run from zero to three or, in the case of , from one to four. latin indices a, b and
c are used for all other ranges, often one to eight or one to seven.

we use two conventions for the generators of su(2). the pauli matrices are written
i and satisfy ij = ij12 + iijkk, with 12 the 2  2 unit matrix and 3 = diag(1,1).
for simplicity of notation, we also use the basis ei =  i
2 i and the inner product h , i =
2trace ( , ). this gives hei, eji = ij and [ei, ej] = ijkek.

2 the moduli space of nahm data

2.1 the nahm data

nahm data are quite complicated to describe. the nahm data are matrix functions of
a single variable over the nite interval dened by the eigenvalues of the asymptotic higgs
eld. su(3) nahm data correspond to the asymptotic higgs eld  in (1.2) and so the
interval is (s1, s3]. the interval is subdivided by the intermediate eigenvalues. in our case
the interval is subdivided by s2 into (s1, s2] and [s2, s3]. each subinterval corresponds to
a dierent monopole type and the dimension of the associated matrix functions is equal
to the charge of that type of monopole. there are boundary conditions at the end points
of the interval and matching conditions between matrices at boundaries between dierent
subintervals. in each subinterval the nahm data satisfy the nahm equations. from the
nahm data the corresponding monopole elds may be constructed [36].

the (2, 1) nahm data are a quadruple (t0,t1,t2,t3). each t is a function of s 
(s1, s3]. for the lefthand interval, s  (s1, s2], t = t a 2  2 skewhermitian matrix
function satisfying the nahm equation. for the righthand interval, s  [s2, s3], t = t is a
1 1 skewhermitian matrix, in other words it is an imaginary number. in the construction
of monopole elds from nahm data, the (2, ) elds are derived from the s  (s1, s2] nahm
data and the ( , 1) elds from the s  [s2, s3] nahm data. the reason that the lefthand
nahm data are 2  2 and the righthand nahm data are 1  1 is that this is (2, 1) nahm
data. it can be represented by the diagram

the nahm equations are

(2.2)

where (i j k) is a cyclic permutation of (1 2 3). for the (2, 1) nahm data this means the
lefthand nahm data satisfy

dti
ds

+ [t0, ti] = [tj, tk].

(2.3)

on the righthand nahm data the nahm equations mean the ti are constants. the bound-
ary conditions require ti to have simple poles at s = s1 whose matrix residues form an
irreducible representation of su(2). finally t is called continuous if

t(s2) = (t(s2))2,2.

(2.4)

ti are required to be continuous. t0 is not required to be continuous.
in this paper we use the nahm data to calculate the metric on the moduli space of
monopoles. we do this by assuming that the moduli space of monopoles and the moduli
space of nahm data are isometric; in fact this isometry has only been proven to exist for
su(2) [37]. the l2 metric on the nahm data is

where

and (i, j, k) are quaternions.

2.2 the nahm construction

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

in order to construct monopole elds from nahm data the adhmn equation must be

solved. this is the ordinary dierential equation

[12k

xjj + ixj

tj  j)]v = 0.

(2.8)

for s  (s1, s2], k = 2 and v = v (s; x1, x2, x3), a complex 4-vector. (x1, x2, x3) is the
point in space at which the eld is being constructed. for s  [s2, s3], k = 1 and v =
v(s; x1, x2, x3), a complex 2-vector. v is required to be continuous in the sense that the

6

three and four components of v (s2; x1, x2, x3) are required to be equal to v(s2; x1, x2, x3).
there is a three-dimensional space of these v and an orthonormal basis is chosen with
respect to the inner product

(v1,v2) =z s2
if v1, v2, v3 is such a basis the higgs eld is

(2.9)

(2.10)

with similar expressions for the gauge elds.

in unpublished work done in collaboration with paul m. sutclie this construction has
been performed for (2, 1)-monopoles using the numerical scheme of [23]. it is observed that
generally there appear to be three monopoles and that the ( , 1)-monopole energy peak
becomes lower and closer to the (2, )-monopole centre of mass as m is made smaller.

2.3 group actions on the nahm data

another important aspect of the nahm data is the group action. it is also hard to

describe succinctly. generally

t0
ti

7 gt0g1 
7 gtig1

dg
ds g1,

(2.11)

denes an action on the nahm data. on the lefthand interval g is a u(2) matrix function
g, on the righthand interval it is a u(1) function g. let us dene

g0, = {g  c ([s1, s2], u(2)) : g(s1) = 12},

and

g,0 = {g  c ([s2, s3], u(1)) : g(s3) = 1}.

g is called a gauge transformation if g  g0,0,0 where

g0,0,0 =(cid:26)g = (g, g) : g  g0,, g  g,0, g(s2) =(cid:18) 1

0 g(s2) (cid:19)(cid:27) .

0

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

it should be noted that the gauge transformation satises a strong condition at s = s2. as
well as requiring continuity (g(s2))2,2 = g(s2) the condition also xes the other entries of
g(s2).

this action is called a gauge action because monopoles constructed from gauge equiv-
alent nahm data are gauge equivalent. the space of nahm data is only dieomorphic to
the monopole moduli space once the gauge action has been factored out. this factored
space is called the moduli space of nahm data.

7

the reason for writing the gauge group g0,0,0 with three superscripted zeros is that there
are three boundary and junction conditions beyond the continuity condition (g(s2))2,2 =
g(s2). the rst zero refers to the g(s1) being the identity, the second zero to the strong
condition at s = s2:

g(s2) =(cid:18) 1

0 g(s2) (cid:19) ,

0

(2.15)

and the third zero to g(s3) being the identity. for similar groups in which the second
or third condition is relaxed, the corresponding zero is replaced by a star. these groups
are important because group transformations which do not satisfy these two conditions
nonetheless map nahm data to nahm data and are used frequently in the calculation of
the metric. they are used to derive all the nahm data from a specic ansatz solution and
the group parameters are used as coordinates on the moduli space. thus, the groups we
will need are

and

where

g0,,0 =(cid:8)g = (g, g) : g  g0,, g  g,0, (g(s2))2,2 = g(s2)(cid:9)
g0,, =(cid:8)g = (g, g) : g  g0,, g  g,, (g(s2))2,2 = g(s2)(cid:9) ,

g, = {g  c ([s2, s3], u(1))}.

we will also use

g0,0 = {g  c ([s1, s2], u(2)) : g(s1) = 12, g(s2) = 12}.

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

the group g,0,0, in which the rst condition is relaxed, is used later in this section when
dening the rotational so(3) action.
in the (2, [1]) case considered by dancer the asymptotic higgs eld has two equal

eigenvalues, this means

 = i

(2.20)

which has little group u(2). the (2, [1]) case has minimal symmetry breaking; su(3) is
broken to u(2). since m = 0, the nahm data may be represented as

2




s1

1

s2

(2.21)

the gauge action on this nahm data is given by g0,0 and the unbroken u(2) is g0,/g0,0.
in the (2, [1]) moduli space this u(2) is an isometry. there is a similar u(2) action when
m is not zero. however, it is not an isometry. this u(2) action is g0,,/g0,0,0. the u(2)

8

isometry found in the (2, [1]) case has split into two parts. there is an s3 part at s = s2
which may be written as the coset g0,,0/g0,0,0 and a u(1) which may be written as the
coset g0,0,/g0,0,0.
it is useful to discuss the physical meaning of the group transformations. the ( , 1)-
monopole has a well dened position given by

r = i(t1, t2, t3).

(2.22)

this is xed under the maximal torus of the u(2)= g0,,/g0,0,0 action consisting of group
elements which are diagonal at s = s2. the action of this maximal torus is isometric.
the orbit of r under the u(2) action is an ellipsoid; this will be clear when we write
down solutions of the nahm equations in section 2.5. this ellipsoid corresponds to the
coset u(2)/u(1)2. thus the group action consists of an isometric maximal torus and a
nonisometric coset which moves the ( , 1)-monopole around on an ellipsoid.

there is also an so(3) action which rotates the whole monopole in space. the nahm
data are acted on by rotating (t1,t2,t3) as a three-vector. precisely, if a  g,0,0 and
a(s1) maps to the so(3) matrix (aij), this action is dened by

da

ti  a(xj

ti  xj

da

,

where (a(s2))2,2 = a(s2). thus, the so(3) action rotates the (t1,t2,t3) without disturbing
the matrix residues at s = s1.
finally there is a translational r3 action on the nahm data. it is given on the nahm

data by

ti
ti

7 ti + ii12,
7 ti + ii.

(2.24)

this action is an isometry and corresponds to a translation in space of the whole monopole.

2.4 the centre of mass

the overall motion of a monopole is free and the (2,1) moduli space decomposes as

figure 1: an illustration of the denition of the various separation vectors.

where the r3 and r correspond to the overall position and overall phase. m0
(2,1) is called
the centred moduli space and contains the nontrivial structure of m(2,1). calculating the
metric on m0
(2,1) is the main business of this paper and this calculation is simplied by
the observation that the traces of the t can be set to zero. this is explained later in this
section.

it is easy to see from the nahm equations (2.3) that the traces of the ti are constant.
this is something they have in common with the righthand data; ti are also constant. a
gauge can be chosen so that both trace t0 and t0 are constants. this does not dene a
specic gauge or specic constants: neither constant is gauge invariant. the invariant com-
bination is mtrace t0 + mt0 and this combination plays a signicant role in the calculation
done in this section.

the metric can now be rewritten in terms of traceless data and the traces themselves:
the nahm data t are replaced by t + ir12 where t is now traceless. dening r as
above, (2.22), and r0 = it0, the metric (2.5) becomes
drdr z s2

trace dtdtds.

(2.26)

ds2 = 2mx

drdr + mx

s1 x

furthermore, the action of the translation action and the fact that the ( , 1)-monopole
position is r suggests that the centre of mass of the (2, )-monopole is positioned at r.
this is illustrated in figure 1, along with the relative position vector

this implies that the centre of mass is given by

i = ri  ri.

2mri + mri

2m + m

ds2

centre = (2m + m)d(cid:18)2mr + mr

2m + m (cid:19) d(cid:18)2mr + mr
2m + m (cid:19) .

(2.30)

thus the metric separates into two terms, one of which is at. in section 3 the metric on
the term which is not at is calculated. the i satisfy the same continuity conditions with
respect to the traceless nahm data as ri do with respect to the general nahm data. this
means that the metric we want is the metric on the space of traceless nahm data.

thus, in section 3 the metric is calculated on the space of nahm data with traceless
ti and t0 and with the mass m replaced by the reduced mass 2mm/(2m + m) as in
(2.29). for simplicity, rather than changing to the reduced mass, we will continue to use
m = s3  s2 and to denote the space by m0
(2,1). in fact, it is demonstrated above that in
the metric on m0
where it is xed using a hyperkahler quotient.

the xing of the centre of mass is discussed from a dierent perspective in section 4

(2,1) the mass m must be replaced by the reduced mass.

2.5 solving the nahm equations

the nahm equations on the lefthand interval are easy to solve. the ansatz

t0(s) = 0,
ti(s) = 

i
2

fi(s)i = fi(s)ei,

reduces them to the well-known euler-poinsot equations

d
ds

fi(s) = fj(s)fk(s),

(2.31)

(2.32)

where (i j k) is an cyclic permutation of (1 2 3). assuming [f1(s)]2  [f2(s)]2  [f3(s)]2
the solutions are the euler top functions

f1(s) = 

f2(s) = 

f3(s) = 

,

,

d cnkd(s  s1)
snkd(s  s1)
d dnkd(s  s1)
snkd(s  s1)
.

d

snkd(s  s1)

(2.33)

these solutions have a pole of the correct form at s = s1. k is the elliptic parameter and
0  k  1. in order for the nahm data to be nonsingular inside the interval (s1, s2] we
must have d < 2k(k)/m, where k(k) is the usual complete elliptic integral of the rst
kind. thus, the ansatz yields a two-parameter space of solutions. the nahm data ti on
the righthand interval are determined by the continuity condition (2.4) at s = s2.

11

of course, not all nahm data are produced by this ansatz. however, all the required
nahm data can be produced by acting on this two-parameter ansatz space with the group
actions described in section 2.3 and below. in other words, d and k label group orbits and
the complete orbit of the ansatz space is the whole manifold. the orbits are not identical,
however, and the ansatz space is not a manifold.

there are two group actions on the nahm data. first there is the so(3) rotation
action given in (2.23). on uncentred nahm data, we also have an action of g0,,/g0,0,0 =
(u(2)  u(1)) /u(1). one eect of centring the nahm data by the procedure of section
2.4 is that the group action must have unit determinant. thus the correct group action on
the centred nahm data is so(3)s (g0,,/g0,0,0) = so(3)  su(2). after a general such
transformation, the nahm data can be put in the form

(t0, ti) =  g

this is an eight-dimensional space of nahm data. this eight-dimensional space is assumed
to be isometric to the relative moduli space of (2, 1)-monopoles. we use m0
(2,1) to denote
both of these moduli spaces.

2.6 coordinates and one-forms

eight coordinates on m0

(2,1) are now required. in order to dene such coordinates, an
explicit representation of the group action at s = s2 in terms of euler angles is needed.
this is given by

g(s2) =  cos 

sin 

2 e i
2e i

2 (+)  sin 
2e
cos 
2 e

2 ()

i

i

2 ()

2 (+) ! .

(2.35)

since the group action on the nahm data is an adjoint action, it descends from su(2) to
so(3) action under the usual homomorphism

in terms of the euler angles the matrix e is

g(s2) 7 eij =

1

the nahm data are acted on by both this group action and the rotation action dened in
(2.23). after acting with general elements of these groups the traceless nahm data are

t1(s) = xi,j

t2(s) = xi,j
t3(s) = xi,j

five of the coordinates introduced by dancer on the (2,[1]) moduli space can be imme-

diately adopted as coordinates on m0

(2,1).

1 = ht1, t1i  ht2, t2i,
2 = ht1, t1i  ht3, t3i,
3 = ht1, t2i,
4 = ht1, t3i,
5 = ht2, t3i.

(2.39)

these coordinates are invariant under the gauge and group actions and independent of
s. 3, 4 and 5 are coordinates for the rotational action. in the (2, [1]) moduli space
combinations of 1 and 2 are the separation and cloud parameters. they play a similar
role here except that the cloud parameter in the m = 0 case becomes a genuine separation
parameter when m is not zero. it then corresponds to the separation of the ( , 1)-monopole
from the centre of the (2, )-monopole. the last three coordinates used in [9] are

cos 6 = ht3, e3i
kt3k

,

cos 7 = h[t3, t2], [e3, t3]i
k[t3, t2]kk[e3, t3]k

sin 

8 = ht3, e2i
k[t3, e3]k

,

,

(2.40)

(2.41)

where in each case the righthand side is evaluated at s = s2.

two of these coordinates, 6 and 7, are gauge-invariant, that is, invariant under a
general element of g0,0,0. if a = 13 they correspond to the  and  euler angles which
determine the position of the ( , 1)-monopole on the ellipsoid. thus they parameterise an
s2 surface acted on by su(2).

the third coordinate, 

8, is not gauge invariant. the diagonal u(1) subgroup of the
su(2) action corresponds to the relative phase of the two monopoles. the overall phase
of the (2, )-monopole is given by 
, 1, , . . .)-

8. the expression for the phase of a (. . . ,

monopole in the moduli space of (1, 1, . . . , 1)-monopoles is ir t0ds [35]. consequently we

try the combination

t0ds.

(2.42)

this is a well-dened coordinate: direct calculation shows that it is gauge-invariant. it has
a clear physical interpretation; the two terms are the phases of the (2, )-monopole and the

8 = 

8 + iz s3

s2

13

( , 1)-monopole in that order. this shows that the relative phase of the ( , 1)-monopole and
the (2, )-monopole is changed by a group action but not by a gauge action. furthermore,
the normalisation of 8 is correct because it is identied modulo 2 under the group action
g0,0,/g0,0,0.
[9] in the m  0 limit. this is a smooth limit.

it should be noted that the coordinates above reduce to the coordinates used by dancer

2.7 one-forms and tangent vectors

now that we have a full set of coordinates for m0

(2,1) we can compute the metric. to
do this a basis of one-forms is derived by taking the exterior derivatives of the coordinates:
a, a = 1 . . . 8. a basis of tangent vectors orthogonal to these one-forms is then found and
their inner product calculated. this gives a local expression for the metric.

thus, it is now important to dene a basis of physically motivated and computationally
convenient one-forms and express the metric in terms of these. one-forms corresponding
to 1 to 5 are dened as a = da for a = 1 . . . 5. to deal with the su(2) group action
we start by considering the set of left-invariant one-forms. these are

6 = cos 
7 =  sin 
8 = d


8 + cos 6d7.

8d6 + sin 

8 sin 6d7,

8d6 + cos 

8 sin 6d7,

(2.43)

to perform the explicit calculation of the metric, matters are simplied greatly if we use
the u(1) isometry to work at innitesimal 
it may be assumed that for all explicit
8.
calculations, we are working in this limit in which, neglecting innitesimal terms, these
expressions become

6 = d6,
7 = sin 6d7,

8 = d

8 + cos 6d7.

the reason 
8 appears with a prime is that we will have cause to modify it when we come
calculate the metric. we reserve the symbols a for a = 1 . . . 8 for the one-forms used in
the calculation.

8 is well-dened. although 8 = 


t0ds
alone is the well-dened coordinate, d
t0ds) are both well-dened
one-forms. they each give gauge-invariant results when contracted with tangent vectors.
the tangent vectors are discussed in the remainder of this section and the gauge invariance
t0ds). in the case
8 + cos 6d7 gauge invariance follows from the fact it is the one-form used in the

of the contraction can be seen by direct calculation in the case of d(ir s3

the next problem is that of nding the tangent vectors to a point in m(2,1). in the
nahm description these tangent vectors are quadruples (y0,y1,y2,y3) where each y is
a 2  2 skewhermitian matrix function, y, on the lefthand interval and an imaginary
function, y, on the righthand interval. in other words, y(s)  u(2) and y(s)  u(1).
in order for these vectors to be tangent to m(2,1), yi must satisfy the linearisation of the
conditions satised by ti. this means they satisfy the linearised nahm equations. on the
lefthand interval the linearised nahm equations are

dy1
ds
dy2
ds
dy3
ds

+ [y0, t1] + [t0, y1] = [t2, y3] + [y2, t3],

(2.44)

+ [y0, t2] + [t0, y2] = [t3, y1] + [y3, t1],

+ [y0, t3] + [t0, y3] = [t1, y2] + [y1, t2].

on the righthand interval the linearised nahm equations require yi to be constant. to
preserve the tracelessness of the lefthand nahm data trace yi must be set to zero; this is
consistent since (2.44) implies that trace yi are constant. furthermore, the yi must be
continuous. this means we have yi = (yi(s2))2,2. since the points of m(2,1) correspond to
gauge-equivalent sets of nahm data, the tangent vectors must also be orthogonal to the
gauge transformations. the inner product on the tangent space is given by

(x ,z) = z s2

s1 x

trace xzds z s3

s2 x

xzds,

(2.45)

where x and z are two tangent vectors composed of the quadruples (x0,x1,x2,x3) and
(z0,z1,z2,z3). the metric is derived from this inner product and it is with respect to
this inner product that the tangent vectors and the gauge transformations are required to
be orthogonal. an innitesimal gauge transformation has the form

(cid:18)d

ds

+ [t0, ], [t1, ], [t2, ], [t3, ](cid:19) ,

(2.46)

on the lefthand interval.  is a u(2) function which is zero at s = s1 and proportional to
diag(0, 1) at s = s2. on the righthand interval the innitesimal transformation has the
form

(2.47)

where  and  satisfy the continuity condition (s2) = ((s2))2,2. the orthogonality
conditions derived from this transformation are

(2.48)

and y0 must be continuous:

y0 = (y0(s2))2,2 .

(2.49)
it is noteworthy that gauge orthogonality imposes similar conditions on y0 as those already
imposed on yi by the linearised nahm equations. this is related to the hyperkahlerity of
m(2,1).
it is useful that the conditions above are similar to those found by dancer [9]. the
conditions on the y are precisely the same. the additional conditions do not impose
additional constraints; they dictate the values of y corresponding to given y. this means
the tangent vectors at the point where (t0, t1, t2, t3) is (0, f1(s)e1, f2(s)e2, f3(s)e3) are
known; they follow from those presented in [9]. for the sake of completeness, these are
reproduced here. y(s) are elements of the lie algebra of su(2) and so can be represented
i=1 yi(s)ei. representing the index i as a vector index the solutions of the

linearised nahm equation are

by y(s) = p3
y0(s) =

the tangent vectors transform in a simple fashion under the so(3) and su(2) group
actions. tangent vectors at the general point in m0

(2,1) given by (2.34) are

{y0,yi} = {gy0g1, gaijyjg1}.

(2.53)

there are eight independent tangent vectors at every point of m0
coordinates a on m0

(2,1), a basis of eight tangent vectors given in components as y a

(2,1). given a set of eight
 can

)  a(t)

a.

(2.54)

this method is then used to construct tangent vectors orthonormal to the one-forms.

16

2.7.1 the dual bases of one-forms and tangent vectors

in order to calculate the metric we need a basis of one-forms and a basis of tangent
vectors such that the two bases are dual in the sense of (2.54). we wish to replace the
one-form 
8 with a one-form which is derived from the well-dened angle 8 rather then

8. however, if we proceed in the straightforward manner using the basis of one-forms
derived from the coordinates a for a = 1 . . . 7 and



8 + d(cid:18)iz s3

s2

t0ds(cid:19) = d8 + cos 6d7,

(2.55)

we create unnecessary computational diculties because the expressions for the tangent
vectors which result are both very complicated and very dierent from those used by
dancer to calculate the (2, [1]) metric. instead, we apply the orthonormalisation procedure
as follows. we begin by dening the eight tangent vectors used by dancer [9] in the
calculation of the (2, [1]) metric. these are y a for a = 1 . . . 8 which are dual to a for
a = 1 . . . 7 and to 
(2.56)

8. thus

a(y b) = b
a,

for a = 1 . . . 7 and b = 1 . . . 8 and

8(y b) = b

8,

(2.57)

for b = 1 . . . 8. as these are the (2, [1]) tangent vectors, the orthonormalisation depends on
y a and not on ya.

we must now introduce 8 which is the modied form of 
8.

if we proceed in the

straightforward manner illustrated in (2.55) and we use

d(cid:18)iz s3

s2

t0ds(cid:19) (y a) = imya

0 ,

(2.58)

we see that the one-form (2.55) is not dual to the convenient set of tangent vectors. instead
we dene

7

8 = d8 + cos 6d7  im

ya
0a.

(2.59)

xa=1

with this new eighth one-form 8(y a) is zero for a = 1 . . . 7. clearly, the conditions
a(y b) = b
a for a, b = 1 . . . 7 are unaected. also, 8 is a good one-form as it involves only
the exterior derivatives of well-dened coordinates. it only remains to look at the action
of 8 on y 8. this is

(2.60)

8(y 8) = ,

where

thus the basis of dual tangent vectors is given by y a where

 = 1 + imy8
0 .

y a = y a,

17

(2.61)

(2.62)

for a = 1 . . . 7 and

y 8 =

1
y 8.

what this means is that 8 is proportional to 

8 = d

8 + cos 6d7, in fact,

8 = 

8 = (d

8 + cos 6d7).

(2.63)

(2.64)

an explicit expression for  is given later. note that, apart from this change to the eighth
one-form and eighth tangent vector, the one-forms and tangent vectors are precisely those
used in the construction of the (2, [1]) metric [9, 26]. the eight tangent vectors can be
written out in terms of the coordinates m and n above but it would be tedious to give
these expressions here.

in summary, the one-form 

8 is well-dened but is not identied modulo 2 under the
group action and cannot therefore be written in terms of euler angles. we have constructed
a one-form 8 in terms of well-dened coordinates which turns out to be simply a rescaling
of 
8.

2.8 the metric

the tangent vectors are uniquely determined by the orthonormalisation procedure in
section 2.7 and we can now construct the metric on m0
(2,1) in terms of the inner products
of these tangent vectors. the contribution to the metric from the lefthand nahm data is
given by the formula, found in [9],

ds2

(2, ) = z s2

xa,b=1x

(2.65)

(2.66)

the explicit expression for the metric is given in the next section.

3 the explicit metric

in m0

to calculate the explicit metric it is convenient to follow the version of the m = 0 metric
calculation given in [26].
(2,[1]) the su(2) group action and the so(3) rotational
action are both isometric. this allows the metric to be calculated at one point on the
su(2)so(3) orbit; there is a two-parameter space of such orbits. for the (2, 1) metric,
the isometric actions on m0
(2,1) are the u(1) action of g0,0,/g0,0,0 and the so(3) rotational
action. the righthand nahm data, corresponding to a ( , 1)-monopole at r, break the su(2)
group isometry to a u(1) isometry. this means that the relative metric must be calculated

18

on the whole four-dimensional space of so(3)u(1) orbits. this space is parameterised
by two relative separations and two euler angles giving the relative orientation of the
monopoles. the isometry is used to calculate the metric for an innitesimal so(3)u(1)
action which will give the metric on the whole of m0
working at a point innitesimally close to the identity on the so(3)u(1) orbit means
that the coordinates 6, 7 and 
8 are equal to the euler angles ,  and  respectively,
up to innitesimal terms in the so(3) action. however when the derivative of one of these
coordinates is taken, these extra terms will in general contribute non-trivial couplings of
the so(3) one-forms to d, d and d. this is shown explicitly in (3.4). of course the
gauge-dependent quantities 
8 and  do not appear in the metric, although, as discussed
in section 2.7, their exterior derivatives are well-dened one-forms on the moduli space
and do appear in the metric.

(2,1).

3.1 the contribution from the lefthand nahm data

the notation used in [9, 26] is adopted here. much of the calculation involves evaluating
the elliptic functions fi(s) at s = s2 so in the rest of the paper, if there is no explicit
argument given, it is assumed that the value at s = s2 is used, that is fi = fi(s2). the
same notation is used for the elliptic integrals (2.52) so g1 is used to mean g1(s2) and
g2 to mean g2(s2). of course these integrals are still incomplete elliptic integrals even
though they are integrals over the whole of (s1, s2]. it is also convenient to introduce the
combinations

p1 = g1 +

3.2 the contribution from the righthand nahm data

next, let us turn to the contributions to the metric from the righthand nahm data.
inevitably these have rather long expressions as it is this part of the metric which breaks
the isometry from su(2) to u(1). in the limit of large separation where the su(2) isometry
is restored, these expressions simplify. the contribution from t1, t2 and t3 is

(3.16)

must be added.

in the m  0 limit  = 1 and {i} become a basis of body-xed one-forms for the
isometric su(2) action on m(2,[1]). bearing this in mind it is easy to see that ds2
(2,1) reduces
to ds2
(2,[1]) when m = 0. some of the properties of the metric are examined in section 5.
the asymptotic metric which results when the ( , 1)-monopole is a great distance from the
(2, )-monopole is calculated in section 6.1.

4 the hyperkahler quotient construction and m(2,1)

the quotient of a hyperkahler manifold by a group action is not hyperkahler. in the
hyperkahler quotient construction [20] the moment map is used to restrict the manifold

22

to a level set whose quotient is hyperkahler . in short, if there is a free isometric group
action of a compact group g on a hyperkahler manifold m which preserves the complex
structures there is a triplet of moment maps

.
i : m 7 g

(4.1)

the contraction of the moment map i with an element  of g is a function on m. the
exterior derivative of this function is identical to the contraction of the kahler form i
with the killing vector eld corresponding to . the manifold

n = 1(c)/g

(4.2)

is a hyperkahler manifold provided c1 c2 and c3 are central elements of g

.

the nahm equations appear naturally in the hyperkahler quotient construction because
they are moment maps for the gauge action. the moduli space of nahm data is the
hyperkahler quotient of the space of general matrix functions with the correct boundary
conditions by the gauge group [19]. this was exploited by murray in his calculation of the
(1, 1, . . . , 1) metric [35].

in this section we are concerned with u(1) actions. this means the moment map will

be a map

 : m 7 r3,

(4.3)

and the manifold n will have four fewer dimensions than m.
the purpose of this section is to use the hyperkahler quotient construction to construct
m(2,1) and to derive some of its properties. three u(1) actions are introduced below.
starting from a sixteen-dimensional manifold, described below, the uncentred (2, 1) moduli
space will be obtained by a u(1) hyperkahler quotient. the centre of mass will then be
xed by a further u(1) hyperkahler quotient, leaving an eight-dimensional space. the
nal u(1) quotient will x the position of the ( , 1)-monopole, leaving a four-dimensional
space. if it is xed at the origin, this space is the atiyah-hitchin manifold. physically, this
corresponds to taking the limit of large ( , 1)-monopole mass.

the u(1) actions are subgroups of the torus group whose elements are represented by

s  s1
s2  s1

g = exp(cid:20)i
112  i
g = exp(cid:26)i(1 + 2) + i

s  s1
s2  s1
s  s2
s3  s2

23(cid:21),
[3  (1 + 2)](cid:27).

(4.4)

roughly speaking this u(1)3 contains a gauge u(1), the u(1) of overall phase and a u(1)
of relative phase. the gauge u(1) has 1 = 2 and 3 = 0.

we want to examine these u(1) actions on the moduli spaces. coordinates on the orbit

of the group are given by

1 = iz s2

s1

trace t0ds,

23

(4.5)

trace (t03)ds,

2 = iz s2
3 = iz s3

s1

t0ds

s2

and these transform as

1  1 + 21,
2  2 + 22,
3  3 + 3  1  2.

in order to specify a u(1) subgroup of this u(1)3 we write for example

1 = ,
2 = ,
3  (1 + 2) = 

(4.6)

(4.7)

and then specify a rp2 vector (, , ). the gauge transformation is given by (1, 1,2).
let us write s(, , ) for the u(1) specied by (, , ). the moment map for s(, , )
is a map
(4.8)

(, , ) : m  r3,

and is

i(t ; , , ) = trace ti  trace (ti3) + ti.

(4.9)

of course, the moment map only serves to dene the level set. to calculate the hy-
perkahler manifold the level set must be quotiented by the u(1) action. the quotient by
s(, , ) is performed, in eect, by introducing a group action xing condition of the form
(4.10)

a1 + b2 + c3 = 0.

this xing condition must be invariant under group transformations whose killing vectors
are orthogonal to the s(, , ) killing vector y(, , ) which is

this complements the moment map conditions.

4.1 hyperkahler quotient construction of m(2,1)

the moment map of the gauge action on m(2,1) is

i(t ; 1, 1,2) = trace ti  trace (ti3)  2ti.

(4.17)

and so the level set of the gauge transformation moment map 1(0; 1, 1,2) satises
the xing condition ti = (ti(s2))2,2. what this means is that the moduli space m(2,1) is
the hyperkahler quotient of the space of unmatched nahm data by this part of the gauge
transformation. in this section we use this hyperkahler quotient to attach a ( , 1)-monopole
to a (2, )-monopole. this gives an alternative derivation of the metric on m(2,1).
we have seen how the lefthand nahm data is the same whether or not m = 0 and
that in this sense the space of (2, [1])-monopoles can be interpreted as the space of (2, )-
monopoles. we now consider the sixteen-dimensional manifold which will form the starting
point for our series of u(1) hyperkahler quotients. this is the direct product of the space
of uncentred (2, [1])-monopoles, with the moduli space of a 1-monopole. the moduli space
of a 1-monopole is r3  s1. this describes the position and phase of the monopole.
the nahm data for this product is identical to the nahm data for the space of su(5)
(2, [1], [0], 1)-monopoles depicted below

2




s1

s2

s3

(4.18)

where, as before, m = s2  s1 and m = s3  s2. there is a gap between the lefthand
and righthand nahm data to represent their independence from each other. in the su(5)
analogue, the gap represents the ( , , [0], ) part of the charge.

the (2, [1], , )-monopoles do not interact with the ( , , , 1)-monopole and the sixteen
dimensions of the moduli space of these monopoles separates into twelve moduli parame-
terising the space of uncentred (2, [1])-monopoles and four parameterising the position and

25

phase of the 1-monopole. the nahm data (t0, t1, t2, t3) at s = s2 are u(2)-valued and the
nahm data (t0, t1, t2, t3) on the interval [s2, s3] are a quadruplet of complex numbers. the
metric on this space is

ds2 = ds2

(2,[1]) + mdr2 + mdr2
0,

where r is the position of the 1-monopole given by r = it and r0 = i
now performed. the three moment map equations are

the hyperkahler quotient of the sixteen-dimensional metric (4.19) by s(1, 1,2) is

ti = (ti(s2))2,2.

(4.20)

these are precisely what is required; they identied the position of the ( , 1)-monopole
with a point on the nonabelian cloud of the (2, [1])-monopole. what we are left with is
the a calculation of the (2, 1)-metric without including the interaction of the phases of the
(2, )-monopole and ( , 1)-monopole.

to complete the hyperkahler quotient construction, we must project the tangent vectors
to be orthogonal to the tangent vector which generates the u(1) action. this amounts to
removing from the metric the one-form which is preserved by the u(1) action which is
achieved by setting

1
m

(1 + 2) 

2
m

3 = 0.

(4.21)

the rst two terms above combine into the one-form corresponding to change of phase of
the nonabelian cloud of the (2, [1]) monopole. the third term is the phase of the ( , 1)-
monopole. thus the u(1)-xing condition (4.21) has a physical interpretation; it can be
thought of as matching the phase angle of the cloud in the dancer monopole with the
phase angle of the ( , 1)-monopole. imposing this condition on the metric is equivalent
to requiring that any tangent vector in the metric is orthogonal to the killing vector
y(1, 1,2). performing the hyperkahler quotient explicitly yields the metric (3.15).

4.2 fixing the centre of mass using a hyperkahler quotient

in this section we consider the torus action on the uncentred moduli space m(2,1)
derived above. the nahm data are matched but not centred and so the moment map (4.9)
is

therefore the centre of mass is xed by a u(1) action with

i(t ; , , ) = (  )trace ti + ( + 2)ti.

requiring that this action is orthogonal to s(1, 1,2) implies

( + )

26

(4.22)

(4.23)

(4.24)

and hence the moment map is given by (, , ) = (m, 0, m). this means that the overall
phase is set to zero, that is (a, b, c)=(1, 0, 1). this denes m0
(2,1) as a hyperkahler
quotient of m(2,1). it also demonstrates that the overall phase is 1 + 3.
equally well, the torus action could have been used to x the traces of the lefthand
nahm data. the moment map is i(t )  traceti if  + 2 = 0. thus, the u(1) action
which sets trace ti = 0 and is orthogonal to gauge transformations is given by

(, , ) =(cid:18)

2m + m

m

, 1,2(cid:19) .

(4.25)

the xing condition in this case is given by (a, b, c) = ((2m + m)/m, 1,2m/m). this
seems at rst sight to be unusual; the group action xing condition is claried by writing
it as

2m + m



m

(1 + 3) + (2 + 3) = 0.

(4.26)

we see that the xing condition is the sum of two gauge-invariant pieces. the rst is
the total phase of the (2, 1)-monopole system and the second is the relative phases of the
(2, )-monopole and the ( , 1)-monopole.

the residual u(1), orthogonal both to the gauge u(1) and s((2m + m)/m, 1,2),
is s(0, m, m). by (4.15) a coordinate on this u(1) is 2 + 3. this coordinate is the
coordinate 8 adopted earlier. this can be veried by calculating 2 explicitly in terms of
the group action parameters.

in fact, any point along the line joining trace ti and ti can be xed. however, all these
manifolds are isometric up to a change in the ( , 1)-monopole mass. the proof of this is
essentially the same as the demonstration in section 2.4 that the m0
(2,1) metric can be
calculated from traceless nahm data.

4.3 a hyperkahler quotient of m0

(2,1)

in [9] the hyperkahler quotient construction is used to construct a one-parameter
family of four-dimensional hyperkahler manifolds from the moduli space m(2,[1]). in [22]
it was noted that these manifolds can be thought of as an innite mass limit in which the
( , 1)-monopole in m(2,1) becomes xed in position. this is because the moment map xes
the ( , 1)-monopole degrees of freedom. in this section a similar hyperkahler quotient is
performed on m(2,1).
it is found that the resulting four-dimensional manifolds are the
same as those derived from m(2,[1]).
tient of m0

(2,1) has an isometric action of u(1) given by s(1, 1, 2m/m) the hyperkahler quo-

(2,1) results in a four-dimensional hyperkahler manifold

m0

m4(y; m) = 

1(y, 1, 1, 2m/m)/u(1),

(4.27)

where y  r3. the mass of the ( , 1)-monopole is a parameter for the moduli space m0
and so it might be expected that it also parameterises m4(y; m). for convenience this

(2,1)

27

possible dependence on m has been denoted explicitly. in fact, one of the results of this
section is that m4(y; m) is actually independent of m.
the space of (2, [1])-monopoles is the m  0 limit of the space of (2, 1)-monopoles and
so in our notation the hyperkahler manifolds constructed in [9] are denoted m4(y; 0). in
fact m0
(2,[1]) has a triholomorphic action of su(2) and any u(1) subgroup of su(2) can be
used to perform the hyperkahler quotient. this seems to give a larger class of quotient
spaces than there are for the (2, 1) case. however, this is not the so because every u(1)
subgroup results in the same quotient space.

although y is an r3 vector there is only a one-dimensional space of m4(y; m) for given
m. this is because the action of so(3) on m0
(2,1) maps the space m4(y; m) isometrically
to the space m4(ry; m) where r  so(3). this means the three-parameter dependence
of m4(y; m) on y reduces to a one-parameter dependence on |y|.
(2,1) is

since the moment map for the g0,0,/g0,0,0 action on m0

i(t )  ti

(4.28)

the moment map xes the position of the ( , 1)-monopole, just as in the minimal symmetry
breaking case.

the spaces m4(y; m) have an so(2) isometry corresponding to the so(2) subgroup
of so(3) which xes the vector y. if y = 0 the whole so(3) acts as an isometry. since
we have an expression for the metric on m(2,1), it is possible to explicitly perform the
quotient and derive the manifold m4(0; m). the constraint y = 0 implies the ti are all
1(0).

now, to derive m4(0; m) itself the u(1) action must be quotiented out. this action
(4.32)
and the u(1) is quotiented out by discarding the (d  kk1/e)2 term in (4.30). the
resulting metric is,

   + 0,

which is the atiyah-hitchin metric up to a scale of a quarter.

in [9], it was shown that when y = 0 and m = 0 the hyperkahler quotient gives the
double cover of the atiyah-hitchin manifold. from the above we see that the metric on
m4(0; m) is independent of m and m4(0; m) is the double cover of the atiyah-hitchin
manifold for all values of m. this is not surprising as m4(0; m) is a four-dimensional
hyperkahler manifold with an isometric so(3) action and there is only a small number of
manifolds with these properties. furthermore m4(0; m) is the double cover of the atiyah-
hitchin manifold when m = 0 and so if m is varied the only possible variation of the metric
is by an overall scaling. this point has also been made in [30].

the manifold 

1(0) is a u(1) bundle over the double cover of the atiyah-hitchin man-
ifold. the metric on 
(2,1) denes a u(1) connection
on the bundle. the pullback of the curvature of the u(1) connection to the double cover
of the atiyah-hitchin manifold is a closed two-form. in [11], this two-form was shown to
be so(3) invariant and anti-self-dual. it goes to minus itself under the transformation

1(0) induced from the metric on m0

(1, 2, 3)  (1, 2, 3).

(4.34)

thus it is the well known sen form [16, 38]. this can be seen directly from (4.30) since
the connection is a = h1 with h = kk/e . the resulting curvature f = da is

f = hd1 +

dk  1,

(4.35)

dh
dk

and this is the sen form.

it does not seem possible to perform the hyperkahler quotient tractably for y 6= 0.
however, it can be shown that the resulting manifold does not depend on m. from the
nahm construction the only m dependence in the metric arises from the terms

xz,

mx

(4.36)

in the inner product (2.45) of tangent vectors x and z. since the moment map xes ti this
1(y), given by x = (x, x) have xi = 0. performing
means that tangent vectors on 
1(y) to give m4(y; m) amounts to projecting tangent vectors
the u(1) quotient on 
so that they are orthogonal to the tangent vector that generates this u(1) action. the
tangent vector which generates this action has x0 as its only nonzero component. this
means the orthogonal projection sets the x0 component of that tangent vector to zero.
thus there is no m dependence in m4(y; m). this supports the conjecture that there is
only a one-parameter family of hyperkahler deformations of the atiyah-hitchin manifold.

5 some properties of m(2,1)

in this section we investigate some of the properties of the (2, 1) metric. in section 5.1
the rational map description of the moduli space is used to derive the topology of m(2,1)
and of m0
(2,1). in section 5.2 the metric on the geodesic submanifold of axially symmetric
(2, 1)-monopoles is derived. by examining the behaviour of the monopoles on this geodesic
submanifold it is possible to infer something of (2, 1)-monopole dynamics.

5.1 rational maps

in this section the rational map description of m(2,1) is discussed. the space m(2,1)
is dieomorphic to the space of based rational maps from c to the space of total ags in
c3, denoted f c3. a total ag inside an n-dimensional vector space vn is a series of vector
subspaces 0  v1  v2  . . .  vn1  vn where vi has dimension i. thus, an element
of f c3 is a pair consisting of a complex plane and a complex line lying in that plane. a
rational map from c to f c3 consists of a holomorphic map from c to a line in c3 and
another holomorphic map from c to the plane in c3 containing the aforementioned line.
these maps are not independent since the image line of a point in c must lie in the image
plane. however, each of the maps has a separate degree, these degrees are the topological
charges of the corresponding su(3) monopole.

this dieomorphism was originally described as a dieomorphism between the rational
map space and the moduli space of nahm data [24]. a more recent and more direct
description of the dieomorphism uses the hitchin equation to construct the rational map
directly from the monopole eld [28].

the hitchin equation is a scattering equation along a xed oriented line v in r3,

(dv  i)u = 0.

(5.1)

dv is the covariant derivative in the v direction. if we choose v to be in the x3 direction
then there is a complex plane of lines parameterised by z = x1 +ix2  c. the rational map
is obtained by considering the solutions of the hitchin equation (5.1) along these lines.
the hitchin equation has three independent solutions. the asymptotic behaviour of 
is known and substituting from (1.4) shows there is a spanning set of solutions u1, u2 and
u3 with the behaviour

lim
x3

u1(x3; z)xk1/2

3

es1x3 = e1,

lim
x3

u2(x3; z)x(k1k2)/2

es2x3 = e2,

lim
x3

u3(x3; z)xk2/2

3

es3x3 = e3,

(5.2)

where the ei are the unit eigenvectors of

lim
x3

.

thus the x3   asymptotic hitchin equation nominates three particular solutions
distinguished by their rate of growth or decay. the x3   asymptotic hitchin equation

30

also distinguishes three solutions. these are used to construct the ag.
in the three-
dimensional space of solutions there is a one-dimensional subspace generated by the solution
which decays at the fastest rate as x3   and a two-dimensional subspace spanned
by this solution and the next fastest decaying solution. these subspaces can be written
as linear combinations of the u1, u2 and u3 and the linear coecients dene a total ag
in c3, that is, an element of f c3. the ag depends on z and the bogomolny equations
then imply that this ag varies holomorphically in z. the monopole charge determines the
degree of the map. the monopole boundary conditions for large z show that the map is
based. this means that as z   the map approaches a xed element in f c3.
thus we are interested in based rational maps of degree (2, 1). it is not dicult to
write down the most general map of this type. rather than describing the plane by a pair
of holomorphic lines spanning it we describe it by specifying a line in the plane and a line
perpendicular to it. this perpendicular line is antiholomorphic. thus, the general degree
(2, 1) based rational map is

if af  be = 0 then it follows from the orthogonality condition that the map is not
genuinely of degree (2, 1): either e1 is not a genuine degree two map because z = b/a is
a root of z2 + cz + d as well as of az + b and ez + f , or e2 is degree zero because  =  = 0.
this means af  be 6= 0 and orthogonality determines ,  and  in terms of a, b, c, d, e
and f . in other words, e2 is determined from e1. this means the space of degree (2, 1)
rational maps is isomorphic to (a, b, c, d, e, f )  c6 with the constraint af  be 6= 0. this
is gl(2, c) c2. thus, the moduli space is topologically equivalent to gl(2, c) c2 or,
equivalently, u(2)r8.

the manifold m(2,1) has the product form

m(2,1) = r3

(5.4)

m0
(2,1) is the relative moduli space obtained by quotienting out the centre of mass action,
r3  r. using (5.1) it is possible to determine the eect of translations and gauge
transforms on the map. a translation in the (x1, x2) plane by w  c acts as

e1(z)  e1(z  w),
e2(z)  e2(z  w).

(5.5)

this action can be used to set c = 0.

a translation in the x3 direction by  and a gauge transform g = e has the following

the transformation on e2 is determined by the transformation on e1. the gauge transfor-
mation g changes the overall phase of the monopole. notice that  is an angle only when
m/m is rational. under this transformation

af  be  e(2m +m)(+i)(af  be),

(5.7)

and so af  be can be set to one. setting c to zero and af  be to one xes the centre of
mass and overall phase, allowing us to conclude m0

phase is periodic and the z quotient reduces to a z2 quotient. here m(2,[1]) is the double
cover of what is denoted m 8 in [9]. the rational map description of m(2,[1]) is given by
maps from c to cp2 whose images do not lie in a cp1. this means the rational map
is given by e1. e1 does not lie in a cp1 if af  be 6= 0 and so this constraint applies
for (2, [1]) as well as for (2, 1). in case of (2, 1) we have e2 in addition to e1 but e2 is
determined by e1.

5.2 geodesic submanifolds

the analysis of geodesics on monopole moduli spaces is a formidable task. however, the
existence of tractable geodesic submanifolds allows one to partially deduce their behaviour.
in this section we locate the geodesic submanifold of axially symmetric (2, 1)-monopoles
since the metric on m0
(2,1) is now known we can nd the induced metric on the submanifold
and use this to study the behaviour of axially symmetric monopoles.

32

the xed point set of a isometric action on a riemannian manifold is a totally geodesic
submanifold, the geodesics on the submanifold are also geodesics on the manifold itself.
this is what allows us to study (2, 1) geodesic behaviour using symmetry.

there is an isometric so(3) action on m0
(2,1) so the xed point set of any subgroup
of so(3) will be a geodesic submanifold of m0
(2,1) consisting of monopoles invariant under
the subgroup. a compensating u(1) transform in g0,0,/g0,0,0 may be needed to keep the
monopole invariant. this action is also isometric and if the combined transformations are
a subgroup of so(3)u(1) then the xed point set will still be a geodesic submanifold.
the so(3) and u(1) actions are dened on the the nahm data. symmetric nahm data
are not be strictly invariant under the relevant group action, it will generally change by
a gauge transformation. to be precise about this we need to check that the coordinates
that describe a point on m0
(2,1) are invariant under the group action. such points, if any,
then comprise the geodesic submanifold. given a subgroup of so(3), we look for nahm
data such that the eight coordinates: a, a = 1 . . . 8 of section 2.6 are invariant under a
combined subgroup of so(3)u(1). this will dene a geodesic submanifold.

5.2.1 spherical symmetry

the only lefthand nahm data ti invariant under the so(3) action, (2.23), has the form

ti = 

1

(s  s1)

ei,

that is d = k = 0. from (3.11) the ( , 1)-monopole will be positioned at

 iti =

1
2

(0 , 0 ,1/m)i.

(5.10)

(5.11)

however, spherically symmetric nahm data must have ti = 0. this means there is no spher-
ically symmetric (2, 1)-monopole. in the m  0 limit, a spherically symmetric monopole
appears. of course this has been known for some time [3].

5.2.2 axial symmetry

monopoles which are axially symmetric about the x3-axis can be obtained by requiring
f1(s) = f2(s) in the ansatz (2.31). we must also require t1 = t2 = 0. this is achieved if
k = 1 and  is set to zero or  in (3.11). setting k = 1 in the euler top functions gives

f1(s) = f2(s) = dcosech (d(s  s1)) ,
f3(s) = dcoth (d(s  s1)) ,

(5.12)

where for convenience we have set m = s2  s1 = 1. the ( , 1)-monopole is positioned at
(0, 0,  1
2 d coth d) with the sign depending on whether  is zero or . this is very similar
to the axially symmetric nahm data constructed in [9]. the (2, [1]) nahm data are axially
symmetric if the action in (2.23) with g(s1) = ei3/2 is combined with an action g  g0,

33

that has g(s2) = ei3/2. this means a transformation of this form will leave 1 to 7
unchanged since these are coordinates when m = 0. requiring the relative phase (2.42)
to be unchanged determines what the compensating g0,0,/g0,0,0 transformation must be.
in fact it is easy to see by inspection that 8 will be invariant if t0 is unchanged by the
combined transformation. this implies that g(s3) = ei/2 since (g(s2))2,2 = ei/2. thus
the (2, 1) nahm data are invariant under a combined transform of (2.23) and g0,0, with
g(s1) = ei3/2 and g(s3) = ei/2. the combined transform is thus a diagonal u(1)
subgroup of so(3)u(1) and the nahm data are xed under this action. d can take any
positive value.
these nahm data can be interpreted in terms of monopole congurations. the ( , 1)-
monopole position is iti. we will assume that the energy density of the (2, )-monopole
conguration does not change signicantly with changes of m, the mass of the ( , 1)-
monopole. this means we assume the conguration is similar to the corresponding cong-
uration of (2, [1])-monopoles and so we follow [13] and interpret d as the separation of the
(2, )-monopoles (in the asymptotic metric calculations of section 6.2, d is used with suc-
cess as a separation parameter). we also assume k = 0 represents toroidal (2, )-monopoles
[13]. for large d these nahm data represent two (1, )-monopoles separated along the
x3-axis with approximate positions (0, 0,  1
2 d). since the ( , 1)-monopole is positioned at
(0, 0, 1
2d coth d) it is close to one of the (1, )-monopoles. when it is
very close the conguration should look like a spherically symmetric (1, 1)-monopole well
separated from a (1, )-monopole.

2d coth d) or (0, 0, 1

these nahm data remain axially symmetric if acted on by the u(1) group g0,0,/g0,0,0
whose action commutes with the so(3) action. thus there is a two-parameter family of
axially symmetric monopoles, it is the u(1) orbit of the one-dimensional family parame-
terised by d  [0,). this family we call the hyperbolic region because its nahm data
are hyperbolic. the induced metric on the hyperbolic region is easily obtained from (3.15)
by substituting the constraints above:

ds2 = 1(d)dd2 +

where 1 and 1 are given by

the hyperbolic region is only part of the geodesic submanifold of axially symmetric

nahm data. there is also a trigonometric region in which

f1(s) = f2(s) = dcosec (d(s  s1)) ,
f3(s) = d cot (d(s  s1)) .

34

(5.15)

by an argument which is identical to the above, these nahm data are invariant under the
diagonal subgroup of so(3)u(1). they correspond to k = 0 euler top functions, however
if k is set to zero in (2.33) the nahm data which result are axially symmetric about the
x1-axis. the solutions (5.15) correspond to a dierent ordering of the f1, f2 and f3 and may
be obtained from the ansatz space by rotation. for t1 = t2 = 0,  is again zero or  and
the position of the ( , 1)-monopole is given by (0, 0, 1
2d cot d). this is the trigonometric
region. d  [0, ) and the two regions are joined at d = 0 where the nahm data are
rational and k is not determined.
in the trigonometric region the (2, )-monopoles are coincident and toroidal in shape.
the trigonometric nahm data also remain axially symmetric if acted on by the u(1) factor
g0,0,/g0,0,0. the metric on the trigonometric region is

the two regions t together smoothly at d = 0 and together form a geodesic sub-
manifold of m0
(2,1). in the hyperbolic region, 1 continually decreases as d increases and
approaches 1/2 as d  . thus the hyperbolic region asymptotes to a cylinder of radius
1/(2 + m) as d  . in the trigonometric region, 2 continually increases as d increases
with 2   as d  . thus the trigonometric region asymptotes to a cylinder of radius
1/m as d  . the whole submanifold can be pictured as a surface which asymptotes
at either end to cylinders of radii 1/(2 + m) and 1/m respectively. in the m = 0 limit it
asymptotes to a cone at one end; this was studied in [12]. the surfaces for diering values
of m are depicted in figure 2.

since there is a u(1) isometry the geodesics are easy to analyse. the charge

2 

1 + m

,

q =

(5.18)

is conserved. here  = d/d where  is a parameter along the geodesic and we denote
by  either 1 or 2 depending on which region the geodesic is in. since the centre of
mass and the phase of the (2, )-monopole are xed, q is the total electric charge of the
( , 1)-monopole.
the following scattering process occurs. starting near the boundary in the trigono-
metric region, that is the upper part of the surfaces in figure 2, d is close to . the
(2, )-monopole is at the origin and its elds look like those of the axially symmetric em-
bedded su(2) two-monopole. the ( , 1)-monopole is approaching the (2, )-monopole from

decreasing it is possible that the geodesic will only travel a certain distance downwards
before returning upwards again. we can rewrite (5.13) and (5.16) in the form

for some x0. holding e xed and increasing q decrease x0, the point where the geodesic
returns.
if the electric charge q = 0, then the geodesic never returns; x keeps increasing and the
( , 1)-monopole passes through the (2, )-monopole conguration and on to the negative
x3-axis. the geodesic passes from the trigonometric region into the hyperbolic region and
the toroidal (2, )-monopole breaks apart: as d   the ( , 1)-monopole is approximately
positioned at (0, 0,d/2) and the (2, )-monopole conguration becomes particle-like with
the (1, )-monopoles positioned at approximately (0, 0,d/2). the ( , 1)-monopole is
asymptotically coincident with one of the (2, )-monopoles giving one spherically symmetric
(1, 1)-monopole and one (1, )-monopole.

36

it is instructive to compare of the q = 0 geodesic with the corresponding geodesic in
the m0
(2,[1]). in that case m = 0 and the ( , 1)-monopole is replaced by a cloud. starting in
the hyperbolic region the geodesic describes two widely separated monopoles approaching
each other along the x3-axis. the cloud size is minimal. the monopole instantaneously
forms the spherically symmetric (2, [1])-monopole and then the monopole deforms to a
toroidal shape as it approaches the su(2) embedded solution. as it does so the cloud size
continually increases. this is consistent with the m 6= 0 discussion if one adopts the view
that the cloud size is a measure of the distance of the notional massless monopole position
from the position of the massive monopoles. when the ( , 1)-monopole is coincident with
one of the (2, )-monopoles there is no cloud. the cloud appears only when the ( , 1)-
monopole is well separated from both of the (2, )-monopoles.

it is also instructive to compare the behaviour of (1, 1)-monopoles with the behaviour of
axially symmetric (2, 1)-monopoles. in the axially symmetric submanifold a geodesic with
nonzero q may return, thus the electric charge gives a repulsive interaction between the
two dierent types of monopoles. for large q the ( , 1)-monopole approaches the toroidal
(2, )-monopole conguration but the monopoles slow down and generically they stop and
separate again. this behaviour agrees with that found in [8] in the dynamics of (1, 1)-
monopoles. there, the geodesics were found to be hyperbolae; no bound geodesics exist.
the relative electric charge of the two dierent types of monopoles has a repulsive eect.
this leads us to conclude that the interaction of the two dierent types of monopoles is
generally repulsive.

6 asymptotic metrics

in this section we derive two asymptotic expressions for the metric. in section 6.1, we
consider the approximate simplication which occurs when the ( , 1)-monopole separation
is large. this is useful because the general behaviour of the geodesics is very compli-
cated. however, if the monopoles of dierent type are repulsive the generic geodesic will
correspond asymptotically to a ( , 1)-monopole well separated from the (2, )-monopole con-
guration. here the interaction is easy to understand; the (2, )-monopoles will interact like
su(2) monopoles but with a slight modication because of the distant ( , 1)-monopole. this
( , 1)-monopole interacts with the (2, )-monopole in a taub-nut like manner. indeed, for
large separations of the ( , 1)-monopole and the (2, )-monopole the metric approximately
simplies to a direct product of the atiyah-hitchin metric and the taub-nut metric. the
corrections to this simplication are algebraic in the ( , 1)-monopole separation distance.
the asymptotic form of the metric which corresponds to large separation of the two
(1, )-monopoles can be calculated by approximating the monopoles by point dyons using
the methods of [34, 15, 33]. it has also been calculated by bielawski [5] using nahm data.
as with the taub-nut approximation to the atiyah-hitchin metric, the point dyon metric
has only exponentially small corrections. at rst glance it seems hard to imagine how the
point dyon metric could be calculated as an approximation to the (2, 1) metric as presented
above and so in section 6.2 we have calculated the radial terms of the point dyon metric

37

from the d1 and d2 terms of the (2, 1) metric.

6.1 large ( , 1)-monopole separation

in this section the ( , 1)-monopole separation is take to be large and the resulting
approximate simplication to the metric is derived. the calculation is a generalisation of
the (2, [1]) calculation in [26] where it is shown that if the cloud size is large the m0
(2,[1])
metric is approximately the direct product of the atiyah-hitchin metric and the at r4
metric.

the ( , 1)-monopole separation is large if the fi are and so dm must be close to 2k.

to leading order in 2k  dm, f1 = 2r and f2 = f3 = 2r where

2r 

d

2k  dm

.

(6.1)

this formula allows us to write d1 and d2 in terms of dk and dr. the incomplete elliptic
integrals g1 and g2 can be approximated by complete integrals giving

g1 
g2 

2

d3k2k2 (e  k2k)
2
d3k2 (k  e).

(6.2)

furthermore, since r is large x is large and p1  g1, p2  g2 and p3  g1 + g2 and so
  1 + mr. using these formula working out the approximate metric is just a matter of
lengthy calculation and substitution. the approximate metric is

b2

(6.3)

where the a2, b2 and c2 are the atiyah-hitchin functions dened above (4.31) and the i
are

1 = d + sin 1  cos 2,
2 = sin d + cos  cos 1 + cos  sin 2  sin 3,
3 = d + cos d  sin  cos 1  sin  sin 2  cos 3.

(6.4)

the i thus contain invariant one-forms for both the su(2) group action and the induced
rotational action.

this is a satisfying result. the metric splits into two parts. one part describes the
interaction of the (2, )-monopole. it interacts as if it was a 2-monopole. the other part
describes the interaction of the ( , 1)-monopole with the (2, )-monopole. it is just a taub-
nut metric and describes the point dyon interaction of two distinct monopoles. it should
be emphasised that there are order r2 corrections to this approximate metric.

6.2 the point dyon metric

it was pointed out by atiyah and hitchin [1] that for large separation of the two
monopoles their metric is approximated with exponential accuracy by a singular taub-
nut metric.
it was subsequently demonstrated [34] that this asymptotic metric could
also have been derived by examining the interactions of point sources of the elds. this
point dyon method was generalised to su(2) multimonopoles [15] and in [33] to larger
groups. although [33] is mostly concerned with (1,1,. . . ,1)-monopoles, it describes what
the point dyon metric is for any monopole. the point dyon metrics are discussed in a
rigorous way by bielawski [4, 5].

the radial part of this dyonic metric is

where r is the distance of each of the (1, )-monopoles from the origin, r is the distance
of the ( , 1)-monopole from the origin and r1 and r2 are the distances of each of the (1, )-
monopoles from the ( , 1)-monopole. r is large.
in this section we derive this metric
from the d1 and d2 terms of the (2, 1) metric to exponential accuracy in r. to do this
we choose a specic conguration and only allow r and r to vary. this conguration is
illustrated in figure 3. in this conguration

r1 = r  r,
r2 = r + r.

(6.6)

we have chosen a region where r is bigger than r and the three monopoles are collinear.
this is a convenient choice, however, the point dyon metric does not rely on r being large
[5].

the separations r and r must be related to quantities appearing in the metric. this

is easy for r since it is well dened in the full metric, it is

common sense, comparison with the atiyah-hitchin case and the numerical calculations
of dancer and leese [13] all suggest that, up to exponential corrections,

r =

(6.7)

39

(6.8)

that this suggestion is correct is demonstrated by the success of the calculation. if r is
large d is large. since dm < 2k this implies 2k is large. for large k

k  log 4/k

(6.9)

and so k is exponentially small [6, eq.600.05]. the rest of this section is concerned with
approximating the metric to leading order in k.

in order to evaluate the two integrals g1 and g2 we must evaluate the incomplete elliptic
integral of the second kind, e(u; k), for u = dm. it follows from the quasiperiodicity of
e(u; k), [6, eqs.113.02 & 903.01], that to leading order in k

e(dm; k)  2  snkdm

now g1 can be evaluated. in glaishers notation, see for example [6, eq.120.02],

and the jacobi functions at u = dm can be re-expressed in terms of f1, f2 and f3. these
in turn can be written in terms of r and r and it can seen that

g2 can be calculated in a similar way and in fact

7 discussion

we began this calculation with two main motivations. first, an explicit expression
for the (2, 1) metric will be useful in the context of hanany-witten theory [18]; a (2, 1)-
monopole corresponds to the hanany-witten brane conguration illustrated in figure 4.
secondly, it would also interesting if the (2, 1) metric or the (1, 2, 1) metric could be used
to conjecture an approximate form for the metric of an su(2) 3-monopole when two of the
monopoles are close together and the other is far away.

if in a su(2) 3-monopole two of the monopoles are close together and one is far away
then the distant monopole has a well dened position and the two monopoles which are
close together have a well dened centre of mass. this situation is not unlike that consid-
ered above. figure 5 illustrates this likeness within the hanany-witten notation. in this
notation monopoles are replaced by threebranes which end on vebranes. there are n
vebranes for an su(n) monopole. the three dimensions of space are the codimensions
in the vebrane of the ends of the threebrane.

there are two types of interaction between the threebranes. there is a short range
force acting between the whole length of vertically aligned threebranes and a long range

force acting on the ends of the threebranes through the vebranes.
in figure 5(a) the
(2, )-threebranes interact through both types of force, the ( , 1)-threebrane interacts with
the (2, )-threebranes only through the vebrane upon which they both end.
in figure
5(b) there are two threebranes close together and one far away. to an exponential approx-
imation the far away threebrane only interacts with the other threebranes through the two
vebranes upon which they all end. because of this it might be expected that the moduli
space of 3-monopoles with two monopoles close together and one far away is exponentially
well approximated by the (2, 1) metric.

in the 3-monopole the threebranes end on the vebranes from the same side and they
all end on two dierent vebranes. in the (2, 1)-monopole the (2, )-threebranes end on
one side of a vebrane and the ( , 1)-threebrane on the other. this implies that for the
approximation to work a sign and a factor of two must be changed in the (2, 1) metric.
in the point dyon metric calculation of section 6.2 the correct change of sign results if
dm is greater than 2k, rather than less than it. the factor of two would be corrected
if, instead of the (2, 1) metric, the (1, 2, 1) metric was used with the (1,
, )-monopole
constrained to be coincident with the ( , , 1)-monopole as illustrated in figure 5(c). the
construction of the (1, 2, 1) metric is discussed below. this picture is very vague, a more
precise understanding of the relationship between asymptotic su(2) metrics and su(n)
metrics would require the more sophisticated methods found in [4, 5].

we were also motivated to calculate the (2, 1) metric by [7]. among the calculations
in this paper is an attempt to calculate the (2, 1) metric using the legendre transform
construction [20, 27]. the constraint equations arising in the legendre transform prove in-
tractable but the formulation itself is of great interest. even without solving the constraint
equation chalmers is able to study some features of the (2, 1) metric, for example, he is
able to extract the point dyon metric. we hope our work will prove useful in investigating
the legendre transform construction of the (2, 1) metric.

an interesting aspect of our calculation is the compelling form of the relative phase

42

coordinate (2.42).
it is the gauge invariant combination of the phase coordinates for
the (2, )-monopole and the ( , 1)-monopole. in section 4.1 this phase coordinate arises
naturally when we use the hyperkahler quotient construction to construct the (2, 1) metric
by attaching a 1-monopole to a (2, [1])-monopole. this use of the hyperkahler construction
provides a simple method for constructing monopoles with no more than two monopoles
of any type. in order to complete the tool box for such constructions we have calculated
the ([1], 2, [1]) metric in section 8. from this the (1, 2, 1) metric could be calculated by
choosing two suitable u(1) actions. as another example, three u(1) actions could be used
to construct the (2, 1, 2, 1) metric by attaching a 1-monopole between the (2, [1]) metric
and the ([1], 2, 1) metric. these methods could also be used to calculated moduli space of
monopoles with other gauge groups like so(5). calculating the (2, 2) metric by attaching
the (2, [1]) metric to the ([1], 2) metric should not be too dicult either, it would simply
require a larger action with which to perform the hyperkahler quotient.

the analysis of section 5.2 suggests it is unlikely that there are bound geodesics on
(2,1). an investigation of the quantum mechanics on m0
m0
(2,1) would be interesting but
very dicult. the classical behaviour suggests the absence of bound states. in addition
s-duality predicts the absence of a sen form on this space because the form would be dual
to w-bosons that are not seen at low energies [14, 33].

8 a space of su(4) monopoles

in this section, the metric on a space of ([1], 2, [1])-monopoles is calculated. the bound-
ary condition breaks the symmetry from su(4) to su(2)u(1)su(2). the asymptotic
higgs eld lies in the gauge orbit of

where s2 = s1 and for convenience we choose s1 = 2. roughly speaking a ([1], 2, [1])-
monopole is composed of two massive monopoles and two massless monopoles. the two
massive monopoles are of the same type and are of dierent type to the two massless
monopoles. these massless monopoles are of dierent type to each other. the relative
moduli space m([1],2,[1]) is twelve dimensional, these twelve correspond to the separation of
the massive monopoles, their so(3) orientation in space, two sets of three su(2) parameters
corresponding to the unbroken gauge group and nally, two cloud parameters. in a (1, 2, 1)-
monopole the (1, , )-monopole does not interact with the ( , , 1)-monopole except in so far
as each of them aects the ( , 2, )-monopole. since the two clouds in the ([1], 2, [1]) case
correspond to a massless (1, , )-monopole and a massless ( ,
, 1)-monopole they should
interact in a relatively simple manner.

in the limit when one of the clouds is at innity m([1],2,[1]) reduces to m(2,[1]) with an
additional innite term. if both clouds are at innity it reduces to atiyah-hitchin but with

43

two innite terms. a restriction which amount to identifying the two clouds reduces the
metric to the one considered in [30].

the general features of this su(4) metric were discussed in [22]. the family of hy-
perkahler four-manifolds which are the hyperkahler quotients of m([1],2,[1]) were discussed
in [10, 22]. along with the previous calculation, the ease with which the monopole metric
is found once the nahm equations are solved shows that the monopole metric problem for
larger groups is not any more dicult than the problem when the group is su(2). it is
clear that if the nahm equations could be solved for k k matrices giving an expression for
the k-monopole metric, then for larger groups the calculation of the metric just requires
patching together solutions from dierent intervals in the manner described here.

the ([1], 2, [1]) nahm data are 2  2 skewhermitian matrix functions of s  [2, 2].
they satisfy the nahm equation and are analytic over the entire closed region. they are
represented by the diagram

the gauge action is g0,0. there are two su(2) actions, one given by g0,/g0,0 and the
other by g,0/g0,0. there is also a translational action like the one discussed above and a
rotational action given by

t0  t0,
ti  xj

rijtj.

(8.3)

(8.4)

the centre of mass and the u(1) action given by exp(if (s)12) are xed in the same way
as before. this means that the nahm data are traceless.

as before, the nahm equations are reduced by the ansatz

t0(s) = 0,
ti(s) = fi(s)ei

(8.5)

to the euler-poinsot top equations. the solutions are euler top functions but with weaker
boundary conditions:

(8.6)

f1(s) = 

f2(s) = 

f3(s) =

with 0 k  1,  >2 and d( + 2) < 2k(k). the extra parameter  reects the analyticity
of the nahm data at s = 2. all signs are negative or exactly two signs are positive. more
solutions are given by sending s to s and changing the signs of fi.
using these solutions to the nahm equations, it is a simple exercise to nd the metric
on m([1],2,[1]). the metric depends on d, k and  and three sets of su(2) coordinates.
each of the su(2)s acts isometrically so it is only necessary to calculate the metric in the
neighbourhood of the identity of the su(2)s. the su(2) actions are then used to nd
the metric at a general point. the method is a duplicate of that used in [9, 26] and the
interested reader is referred to these papers.

coordinates on the quotient space m([1],2,[1])/(so(3)su(2)su(2)) are provided by
(8.7)

1 = k2d2,
2 = d2,

6 = xi

[f 2
i (2)  f 2

i (2)].

the remaining nine coordinates on m([1],2,[1]) are given by su(2) matrices corresponding
to rotations r  so(3) and group actions given by g(2)  su(2) for g0,/g0,0 and
g(2)  su(2) for g,0/g0,0. the metric is written in terms of left-invariant one-forms
given by

ii = rdr,

ii = g(2)dg(2),

ii = g(2)dg(2).

(8.8)

where it should be noted that  and  are dierent symbols. because the su(2) actions
are isometric the coecients of the metric depend only on d, k and  . in order to express
the metric it is useful to dene the following functions of d, k and  ;

g1(k, d,  ) = z 2
a(k, d,  ) = f1(2)f2(2)f3(2) , b(k, d,  ) = f1(2)f2(2)f3(2) ,

the sp(4) condition [30] can be imposed: f1(2) = f1(2), f2(2) = f2(2) and
f3(2) = f3(2), along with the identications 1 = 1, 2 = 2, 3 = 3 . this reduces
(8.12) to the metric found in [30]. alternatively the limit a   or b   can be taken
and it can be shown that this reduces the ([1], 2, [1]) metric to the (2, [1]) metric discussed
in [9, 26] along with an innite term corresponding to the moment of inertia of the cloud
at innity. if a   and b   the metric reduces to the atiyah-hitchin metric along
with innite terms corresponding to the inertia of both clouds at innity.
there is a three-dimensional geodesic submanifold of m([1],2,[1]) obtained by imposing
d2 symmetry on the monopoles. this was denoted  in [22] and is described there. it
is the ([1], 2, [1]) analogue of the y space of dancer and leese [12]. imposing spherical
symmetry on  reduces to one-dimensional submanifolds whose nahm data are

f1(s) = f2(s) = f3(s) = 

1

s + 

(8.13)

where  > 2 or  < 2. using the expression for the metric we can determine the geodesics
if  > 2 and initially decreasing then it continues to
in this one-dimensional example.

approach  =2 without ever reaching there. this corresponds to one of the clouds increasing
to arbitrarily large radius with the other cloud remains small. the massive monopoles are
at the origin. if  > 2 and initially increasing then it reaches  =  in nite time and
then, since  =  and  =  are equivalent by (8.13),  increases from  to approach
2. if  is initially close to two this represents a process where one cloud is initially large
and decreasing. it reaches its minimum size and then the other cloud continually increases
from its minimum size to arbitrarily large radius.
