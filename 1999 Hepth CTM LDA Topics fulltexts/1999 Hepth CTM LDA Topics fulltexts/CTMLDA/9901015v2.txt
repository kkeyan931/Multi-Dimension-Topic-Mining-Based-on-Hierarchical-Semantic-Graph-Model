abstract. we establish the schlieder and the borchers property for thermal eld theories. in addition, we
provide some information on the commutation and localization properties of projection operators.

1. introduction

recently the author has explored the general structure of thermal eld theories in some
detail. here we would like to ll in a gap which concerns two basic results, namely the
borchers and the schlieder property. both results will look familiar to the experts and
even the proofs which we will present here are more or less standard (see e.g. [da] for a
convenient collection of the corresponding results in the vacuum sector). however, a close
inspection shows that the fundamental dierences between thermal and vacuum qft are
clearly reected in slightly dierent assumptions and consequences. for completeness we
add a list of properties (due to florig and summers [fs]) which are all equivalent to the
schlieder property.

in the algebraic formulation (as described in the monograph by haag [h]) a qft is

casted into an inclusion preserving map

o  a(o)

(1)

which assigns to any open bounded region o in minkowski space ir4 a unital c-algebra
a(o). the hermitian elements of the abstract c-algebra a(o) are interpreted as the
observables which can be measured at times and locations in o. the physical states are
described by positive, linear and normalized functionals. by the gns-construction, any
state  on a gives rise to a hilbert space h and a representation  together with a
cyclic vector , such that

(a) =(cid:0) , (a)(cid:1)

a  a = [oir4

c 

a(o)

.

(2)

the representation  automatically determines the values of certain macroscopic observ-
ables in all states, which are normal w.r.t.  (these are exactly those states which can



a linear functional on a is said to be normal relative to , if it is continuous with respect to the ultra-weak

topology determined by . since normal states dier only locally from , various global physical situations will

manifest themselves in unitarily inequivalent gns-representations.

be specied by density matrices   b(h),  > 0, tr  = 1). thus a state is specied
macroscopically by a representation and microscopically by a density matrix.

the relevant states describing thermal equilibrium, the so-called kms-states, will soon
be distinguished within the set of all time-invariant normalized, positive linear functionals
of a by their stability properties with respect to time-like translations. since the associated
gns-representations will allow a unitary implementation of the time-evolution, we will take
advantage of it and formulate our problems in the better developed hilbert space setting.
but before we do so, we should mention that the net o  a(o) satieses a number of
properties which do not depend on the representation:

i.) the net o  a(o) is isotonous, i.e., there exists a unital embedding

a(o1)  a(o2)

if o1  o2.

(3)

this property, called isotony, allows us to consider the quasi-local algebra a which is de-
ned in (2) as the c-inductive limit of the local algebras. the elements of a are called
quasi-local observables; they can be approximated in norm topology by strictly local ele-
ments; the total energy, total charge, etc., are considered as unobservable; these quantities
refer to innitely extended regions and can not be controlled by local measurements.

ii.) observables localized in space-like separated space-time regions commute:

a(o1)  ac(o2)

if o1  o
2.

(4)

here o denotes the space-like complement of o and ac(o) denotes the set of operators
in a which commute with all operators in a(o).

iii.) the space-time symmetry of minkowski space manifests itself in the existence of a
representation

: (, x) 7 ,x  aut(a),

(, x)  p 
+,

(5)

of the (orthochronous) poincare group p 
translations x act geometrically:

+. lorentz-transformations  and space-time

,x(cid:0)a(o)(cid:1) = a(o + x)

(, x)  p 
+.

(6)

for the present letter we may restrict our list of assumptions to include only the (strongly
continuous) one-parameter sub-group of time-translations  : ir  aut(a). of course, it
acts geometrically, i.e.,

here e is a unit vector denoting the time direction with respect to a given lorentz-frame.

t(cid:0)a(o)(cid:1) = a(o + te)

t  ir.

remark. let h  l1(ir, dt) such that the fourier-transform h of h has compact support.
if the group of automorphisms  : ir  aut(a) is strongly continuous, then the bochner
integral

ah =z dt h(x)t(a),

a  a,

(8)

exists in a and denes an entire analytic element for the time-translations. recall that
b  a is called an analytic element for the group  , if there exists a complex neighborhood
n  ic and a function g: n  a such that

g(t) = t(b);

a)

b)

a will denote the set of analytic elements.

z 7 (cid:0)g(z)(cid:1) is analytic for all states  over a.

we now turn to thermal equilibrium states. kubo [k] and subsequently martin and
schwinger [ms] found out that the greens functions of nite-volume gibbs-states satisfy
an auxiliary boundary condition in the complex plane with respect to the time-evolution.
the crucial step was to recognize that the so-called kms-condition not only character-
izes the nite-volume gibbs-states but remains valid in the thermodynamic limit [hhw].
nowadays, the kms-condition is accepted as the appropriate criterion for equilibrium of
nite and innite systems. but only recently, buchholz and junglas have shown that a
large class of relativistic models admits kms-states [bj].

denition. a state  over a is called a (, )-kms-state for some   ir  {}, if

for all a, b in a norm dense,  -invariant -subalgebra of a .

(cid:0)ai(b)(cid:1) = (ba)

(9)

the gns-representation (, h, ) of the net o  a(o) associated with a kms-

state  assigns to any o  ir4 a von neumann algebra

r(o) = (cid:0)a(o)(cid:1)

.

(10)

r := (a) possesses a cyclic (due to the gns-construction) and separating (due to the
kms-condition) vector, namely . the general analysis of kms-states (see e.g. [br])
extends a number of results well known in classical ergodic theory to the non-commutative
case. for instance, the set of kms-states for any xed  > 0 is a weak-* compact,
convex set. an arbitrary kms-state can be represented in a unique manner as a convex
superposition of extremal kms-states.

it is an advantage of the abstract approach that equilibrium states can be distinguished
within the set of all (physical) states from rst principles: in a number of pioneering articles
it has been demonstrated that the extremal kms-states of an innitely extended medium



a kms-state is called extremal, if it can not be decomposed into other kms-states.

4

christian d. j akel

change continuously as the hamiltonian is perturbed slightly. in fact, this condition char-
acterizes the extremal kms-states. they are precisely those states which are distinguished
among (possible other) stationary states by the fact that they turn continuously into the
unperturbed states as a certain family of perturbations tends to zero [hkt-p][ht-p]. this
condition may also be interpreted as the condition for adiabatic invariance [nt]: extremal
kms-states return to their original form at the end of a procedure in which the dynam-
ical law is changed by a local perturbation which is slowly switched on and, as t  
slowly switched o again. a second important characteristic of kms-states is their passiv-
ity [pw], which is the requirement that the energy of the system at time t can only have
increased if the hamiltonian depends on the time and has returned to its initial form at
time t. this condition is just the second law of thermodynamics; it xes the sign of  and
means that no energy can be removed from a kms-state having  > 0, just as a periodic
process can extract no energy from the ground state.

although the representation independent aspects of the map o  a(o) clearly de-
serve attention, we will now specify our results and assumptions in the more restrictive
hilbert space framework. to be precise, in the remainder of this letter we will consider a
tft, specied by a von neumann algebra r with a cyclic and separating vector  and
a net of subalgebras

o  r(o)

(11)

subject to the following conditions:

i.)

the subalgebras associated with space-like separated space-time regions com-
mute, i.e.,

r(o1)  r(o2)

if

o1  o
2.

(12)

note that r(o) denotes the commutant of r(o) in b(h), an algebra that
includes both r
the time-evolution is unitarily implemented by the modular group t 7 it (see
e.g. [br]) associated with the pair (r, ), i.e.,

 and r(o) as subalgebras.

ii.)

 = eh

and it/r(o)it/ = r(o + te)

t  ir.

(13)

here h denotes the generator of the time-evolution and e is the unit vector
denoting the time direction w.r.t. the distinguished rest frame.

iii.) h is separable and  is the unique  up to a phase  time-invariant vector

in h.



it seems that the abstract operator algebraic formulation is inevitable for the describtion of non-equilibrium

situations in which also the macroscopic observables (e.g. the specic heat, the mean magnetization, etc.) will

change in the course of time.

iv.)  is cyclic for r(o), where o is any open subset of ir4; i.e.,

r(o) = h.

(14)

 shares the reeh-schlieder property (14) with the following dense set of
vectors:

d = { = (a)  h : a, a1  a }  r.

(15)

we will show that under these assumptions the following statements are valid:

i.)

ii.)

(schlieder property). given two open space-time regions o, o and some  > 0
such that

o + te  o for

|t| < ,

(16)
the schlieder property holds for the algebras r(o) and r( o). (recall that
a pair of von neumann algebras m and n satises the schlieder property i
0 6= m  m and 0 6= n  n implies that m n 6= 0.)
(borchers property; also called property b). given a non-zero projection opera-
tor e  r(o), where o  ir4 is bounded, there exists a partial isometry v in
the von neumann algebra r( o), corresponding to a slightly larger region o,
such that v v = l1 and v v  = e. one writes

e  l1mod r ( o)

(17)

recall that a factor m is called type iii, if e  l1mod m for all self-adjoint
projections e  m. thus r(o) is almost a factor of type iii.

remark. if the pair (a,  ) is asymptotically abelian in time, i.e.,

lim

t(cid:13)(cid:13)[a, t(b)](cid:13)(cid:13) = 0

a, b  a

(18)

and  is an extremal kms state, then  is the unique  up to a phase  time-
invariant vector in h. the reeh-schlieder property iv.) can be derived from the rela-
tivistic kms-condition [bb] provided the net o  r(o) satises additivity [ja]. jun-
glas [ju] has shown that the reeh-schlieder property of  also follows from the standard
kms-condition, if  is locally normal w.r.t. the vacuum representation. note that we
do not require that there exists a group of unitary operators in b(h) which implements
space-like translations, since spatial translation invariance may be spontaneously broken
in a kms-state.



the net or (o) is called additive if ioi=oir (oi)=r (o).

2. two basic properties of tfts

we start with the analogon of a result of borchers (see [bo]).

lemma 2.1. let e  r, kek = 1 and let f = f  = f 2  b(h) be a projection
operator such that

then f e = 0 implies f eith e = 0 for all t  ir.

(cid:2)eith f eith , e(cid:3) = 0

|t| < .

(19)

proof. it is sucient to show that

(cid:0) , eith f eith e(cid:1) = 0

t  ir,

(20)

for the dense set of vectors ,   d introduced in (15). by denition, the vectors in

d are entire analytic for the energy, i.e., d  d(cid:0)ezh(cid:1) for all z  ic. due to the

kms-relation,

0    /2.

thus the function

r  d(cid:0)eh(cid:1)

(21)

(22)

(23)

is analytic in the strip 0 < z < /2, while the function

z 7(cid:0)eizh  , f eizh e(cid:1)
z 7(cid:0)eizh e , f eizh (cid:1)

is analytic in the strip /2 < z < 0. both functions are bounded and analytic and have
continuous boundary values for z  0 and z  0, respectively. now (19) implies

lim

z0(cid:0)eizh  , f eizh e(cid:1) = lim

z0(cid:0)eizh e , f eizh (cid:1)

|t| < .

(24)

using the edge-of-the-wedge theorem [sw] one concludes that there exists a function

fe,f : g  ic

(25)

which is analytic on the doubly cut strip

g = {z  ic : /2 < z < /2} \ {z  ic : z = 0, |z|  }

(26)

and satises

fe,f (z) =((cid:0)eizh  , f eizh e(cid:1)
(cid:0)eizh e , f eizh (cid:1)

) for ( 0 < z < /2,

/2 < z < 0.)

(27)

two algebraic pproperties of thermal quantum field theories

continuity and f e = 0 imply fe,f (0) = 0. according to lagranges theorem fe,f (z)
vanishes identically if 0 is a zero of innite order. this follows from the original arguments
of borchers: put

t(i)

:=

j

i  in,

j = {1, . . . , n}.

(28)

now set

and

f

where

1 ) . . . f (t(i)

(z) :=(cid:0)eizh  , f (t(i)

for

0  z  /2

(29)

for  /2  z  0,

(30)

(31)

both functions are analytic in the interior of their domains and bounded and continuous

at the boundary. since (cid:12)(cid:12)t(i)

j (cid:12)(cid:12)  /2 for all i  in and j = {1, . . . , n} implies that

1 ) . . . f (t(i)

|z| < /2,

(cid:2)e , eith f (t(i)

n )eith(cid:3) = 0

the boundary values for z  0 resp. z  0 coincide for |z| < /2. applying the
edge-of-the-wedge theorem [sw] one concludes that f + and f  are the restrictions to
the upper (resp. lower) half of the doubly cut strip g/2 of a function

boundary values for z  g/2. since  and  are elements of d (see (15)), there exist
two operators a, b  (a ) such that  = a and  = b. applying the maximum

here we used kk = 1, kek = 1, kf k = 1 and keish k = 1 for all s  ir. in the last
line we made use of the modular conjugation j associated with the pair (r, ) (see e.g.
[br]). by assumption f e = 0, hence

ft(i)

we conclude that inside the circle |z| < /2 each of the functions ft(i)

as a consequence of assumption iii.)  is mixing and therefore the next lemma is

more or less obvious.

lemma 2.2. let e, f  b(h) be two projection operators and assume that

if e 6= 0, it follows that f  = 0.

(43)



we add a result whose analogon in the vacuum sector is due to schlieder [sch, p. 220].

corollary 2.3. let e  r be a nonzero projection and   h an arbitrary nonzero
vector. it follows that the set of points

{t  ir : eeith  6= 0}

is dense in ir.

proof. for t  ir xed, the set of vectors

ht := {  h : eeih t = 0}

is a closed subspace of h. we set

h],[ := \<t<

ht.

(44)

(45)

(46)

by construction, h],[ is the intersection of closed subspaces and therefore h],[
itself is a closed subspace of h. let p denote the projection onto h],[. clearly,

eeith p = 0

t  ir.

(47)

now 0 6= e  r implies e 6= 0. therefore lemma 2.2 implies p  = 0. since
eih teeih t  r for all t  ir, we conclude that

eih teeith dp = 0

christian d. j akel

let p denote the projection onto the closed linear subspace r

h],[. clearly,

eeith p = 0

t  ir.

(49)

but by denition p is the maximal projection such that eeih tp = 0 holds for all t  ir.
it follows that p  p . on the other hand

h],[  r

h],[

(50)

implies p  p , thus p = p . we conclude that p  r. since  is separable for r,
p  = 0 implies p = 0. it follows that for any vector   h there exists some t  ir
such that

eeith  6= 0.

(51)

now consider the projection p onto the one-dimensional subspace ic   and assume there
exists some  > 0 such that

eeith p = 0

|t  s| < 

(52)

with s  ir xed. set p(s) = eish peish . then p(s) = p(s)2 = p(s) is a

eeith p(s) = 0

eeith p = 0

t  ir,

(53)

in contradiction to (51). thus the set {t  ir : eeith  6= 0} does not contain any open

intervall. consequently, it is dense in ir.

theorem 2.4.

(schlieder property). let o and o denote two open (not necessarily

(55)

it follows that 0 6= a  r(o) and 0 6= b  r( o) implies ab 6= 0.

proof. let a  r(o) and b  r( o). we have to show that ab = 0 implies a = 0
or b = 0. from ab = 0 we infer that both a and b can not be unitary. it follows that
one of the expressions aa or aa is unequal to l1. the same is true for bb or bb.
without loss of generality we assume that aa 6= l1 and bb 6= l1. with aa also the
spectral projections of aa belong to r(o) and with bb also the spectral projections
of bb belong to r( o). thus

aabb = 0

(56)

two algebraic pproperties of thermal quantum field theories

11

implies f e = 0 for all spectral projections e  r(o), f  r( o) from the spectral
resolution of aa and bb, respectively. by locality,

lemma 2.1 implies

(cid:2)eith f eith , e(cid:3) = 0

|t| < .

f eith e = 0

t  ir,

(57)

(58)

and from lemma 2.2 it follows that e = 0 or f  = 0. finally,  is separating for
both r(o) and r( o). thus e = 0 or f = 0.


remark. the schlieder property implies that r(o) is almost a factor, namely

r(o)  r( o) = ic  l1.

this can be seen as follows: assume

r(o)  r( o) 6= ic  l1.

(59)

(60)

it follows that there exists a non-trivial projection p such that both

p  r(o)  r( o)

and

( l1  p )  r(o)  r( o).

(61)

set a = p and b = ( l1  p ). the schlieder property implies p = 0 or l1  p = 0, in
contradiction to the assumption that p is a non-trivial projection.

the schlieder property is a rst step towards the statistical independence of r(o)
and r( o). in fact, several precise conditions for statistical independence have been
proposed; an overview can be found in [s]. florig and summers have collected a list of
properties which are equivalent to the schlieder property [fs]:

corollary 2.5. (florig and summers). assume that h is separable. let o, o denote a
pair of space-time regions such that the closure of the open region o is contained in the
interior of o. it follows that

(i)

r(o) and r( o) are c-independent, i.e., for every state 1 on r(o) and ev-
ery state 2 on r( o) there exists a state  on r such that |r (o) = 1 and
|r ( o) = 2.

(ii) r(o) and r( o) are w -independent, i.e., for every normal state 1 on r(o)
and every normal state 2 on r( o) there exists a normal state  on r such that
|r (o) = 1 and |r ( o) = 2.

(iii) for any nonzero vectors ,   h, there exist a  r(o) and b  r( o) such

that a = b 6= 0.

12

christian d. j akel

(iv) the ordered pair (cid:0)r(o), r( o)(cid:1) is strictly local; i.e., for any nonzero projection
 there exists a state  (cid:0)r(o)  r( o)(cid:1)

e  r(o) and any state   r( o)
such that (e) = 1 and |r ( o) = .
for any nontrivial projections e  r(o), f  r( o) and ,   [0, 1] there exists
a state  on b(h) such that (e) =  and (f ) = .

(v)

(vi) r(o) and r( o) are statistically independent in the sense of haag and kastler;
i.e., for every state 1 on r(o) and every state 2 on r( o) there exists a state
 on r such that

(ab) = 1(a)2(b)

(62)

for all a  r(o) and all b  r( o).

(vii) kabk = kak kbk for all a  r(o) and all b  r( o).
(viii) the von neumann algebras r(o) and r( o) are algebraically independent; i.e.,
given two arbitrary sets {ai
: i = 1, . . . , m} and {bj : j = 1, . . . , n} of linear
independent elements of r(o) and r( o), respectively, the collection {aibj : i =
1, . . . , m; j = 1, . . . , n} is linearly independent in r(o)  r( o).

(ix) the map :(cid:0)r(o), r( o)(cid:1)  r(o)  r( o) dened by

(ab) = a  b,

a  r(o), b  r( o),

(63)

is an isomorphism continuous in the minimal c-cross norm on the algebraic tensor
product r(o)  r( o) and can therefore be continuously extended to a surjective
homomorphism : r(o)  r( o)  r(o)  r( o).

remark. if r(o) is a factor of type iii acting on a separable hilbert space, then corol-
lary 2.5 remains valid, if we replace r( o) by r(o). it is remarkable that for such
a pair all normal partial states have normal extensions, none of which is allowed to be a
product state, and also all partial states have extensions to product states, none of which
can be normal.

theorem 2.6. (borchers property). let o and o denote two open and bounded space-
time regions such that

o + te  o

|t| < ,

 > 0.

(64)

given a nonzero projection e  r(o), there exists a partial isometry v  r( o) such
that v v = l1 and v v  = e.

proof. once the schlieder property is proven for r(o) and r( o), the borchers property
follows by standard arguments (see [bo] [da] for the corresponding result in the vacuum

two algebraic pproperties of thermal quantum field theories

sector). we present them here for the sake of completeness only. by assumption the space-
like complement o of o is not empty. thus any vector   d is cyclic for r( o) 
r( o). we show that e is separating for r( o): choose a region o such that

o  o  o

(65)

and consider some b  r( o) such that be = 0. locality implies that bec = 0 for
any c  r(o). by the reeh-schlieder property the set {c : c  r(o)} is dense
in h and therefore be = 0. now the schlieder property for r(o) and r( o) implies
b = 0, since by assumption e 6= 0. we conclude that e is separating for r( o). hence,
the normal state

is faithful on r( o) and there exists a vector   h cyclic for r( o) such that

b 7 (e , be)

(e , be) = ( , b)

b  r( o).

it follows that v : h  h, given by

v b = be

b  r( o),

(66)

(67)

(68)

denes an isometry. both  and  are cyclic for r( o), thus v is densely dened and
its range spans eh. moreover,

cv b = cbe = v cb

c  r( o).

(69)

thus v commutes with all c  r( o) on the dense set {b : b  r( o)}  h and
therefore v  r( o).


remark. the borchers property has interesting consequences for the actual preparation
of states: given an arbitrary state  on r(o)  r( o), we set

v (c) := (v cv )

c  r(o)  r( o).

then

moreover,

v (e) = (v v v v ) = l1

and

v ( l1  e) = 0.

v (b) = (v bv ) = (b)

b  r( o).

(70)

(71)

(72)

this demonstrates that the borchers property allows us to prepare a state v which
satises the properties (71) and (72) by a strictly local operation. we emphasize that
the state given remains completely unchanged in the spatial complement of o. this is a
remarkable dierence to the usual collapse of the wave-function type of preparation.
