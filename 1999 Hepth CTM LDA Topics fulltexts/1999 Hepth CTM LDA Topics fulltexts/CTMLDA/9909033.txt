systems possessing symmetries presence among de- grees freedom redundant gauge variant variables required manifest realisation gauge invariance principle, possibly also symmetries spacetime covariance. consequently, actual physical conguration space systems typically quite intri- cate, whose non trivial topology heart fundamental non perturbative phenomena responsible rich physics implied theories. actual physical conguration space, parametrised initial degrees free- dom modded set local (large small) gauge transformations, corresponds set gauge orbits conguration space initial degrees freedom. usually quantisa- tion systems implements rst gauge xing procedure one kind another, principle select among initial degrees freedom single representative one gauge orbits accessible system throughout dynamical time evolution, thereby dening admissible gauge xing procedure. however, gauge xing procedures meet requirement, said plagued gribov ambiguity. fact, two types gribov ambiguities ought distinguised. rst type gribov problem, local gribov problem, arises gauge xing procedure selects one representative gauge orbit, important point however total number representatives must summed also accounting oriented integration measure induced physical conguration space gauge orbits local integration measure initial conguration space. second type possible gribov problem, global gribov problem, arises gauge orbits system selected gauge xing procedure. clearly, admissible gauge xing procedure one suer neither local global gribov problems. spite importance issue, especially comes non perturbative phenomena, global gribov problem usually specically considered literature, though possibility often arises. local gribov problem hand, arises typically so-called faddeev reduced phase space approach example developed towards quantisation gauge invariant system1, even simplest cases. original example gribov problem could type, accounting oriented integration

gauge slice selected gauge orbits alternating signature determined oriented integration measure space gauge orbits. recently, specic issue addressed conclusion contradistinction gribovs suggestion, within context solvable u(1) gauge invariant quantum mechanical model inspired essentially dimensional reduction ordinary yang-mills theories 0+1 dimensions. besides faddeev reduced phase space approach, also exists bfv-brst in- variant extended phase space formulation gauge invariant systems, eect also imports 1note non vanishing faddeev-popov determinant establishes absence local gribov problem necessarily global one, innitesimal gauge transformations necessarily nite (small even large) ones. thus, non vanishing faddeev-popov determinant necessarily dene admissible gauge xing procedure sense considered above, contrary common usage word literature. 1 issues gauge xing procedure ensuing possible gribov problems. even though questions arise another disguise, nevertheless need addressed specically within context well, even simplest examples2. issue gribov problems thus needs considered case case basis, physical system studied, also gauge xing procedure may contemplated given system. moreover, gribov problem issue also much dependent choice boundary conditions implemented given dynamical problem. hence, procedure resolving gribov ambiguities general, appear, formulated. however, issues arise specically apparent necessity gauge xing gauge invariant systems. gauge xing could avoided altogether, gribov problems would arise, issue would longer need addressed. indeed, recent proposal physical projector within diracs original approach quantisation constrained systems precisely achieves correct integration space gauge orbits system, orbits eectively included

level. 2 course, x = r cos , = r sin . (3) here, x(t), y(t) z(t) cartesian coordinates, (t) gauge variableessentially time component u(1) gauge connection dimensional reduction 0+1 dimensions, g gauge coupling constant. henceforth, also choose work harmonic potential term, v (r) = 2 r2 . (4) 1 2 clear model possesses u(1) gauve invariance whereby (x(t), y(t)) coordinates rotated arbitrary time dependent angle (t) two dimensional plane dene, time variables z(t) (t) shifted quantity proportional either (t) (t). hence, invariance system best expressed polar parametrisation, namely, r(t) = r(t) , (t) = + (t) , z(t) = z(t) + (t) , (t) = (t) + 1 g 1 g (t) . (5) property system already raises issue choice boundary conditions imposed degrees freedom. since later interested computing quantum evolution operator model gauge invariant states, boundary conditions need specied two distinct moments time ti tf , tf > ti. however, degrees freedom (x, y, z; ) need values specied values matter physical status. fact, two distinct physical interpretations degrees freedom (x, y, z) possible, among two combinations manifestly gauge invariant, namely, third gauge variant combination may chosen example, r(t) , (t) = (t) gz(t) , (t) = (t) + gz(t) . (6) (7) particular, note gauge invariant combinations r show gauge orbits space (x, y, z) nothing else helicoidal curves constant radius r, whose symmetry axis parallel z axis, whose slope w.r.t. (x, y) plane set coupling g. consequently, given conguration (r(t), (t), z(t)), nite unique gauge transformation parameter function (t) may always found times z(t) = 0, namely (t) = gz(t), also (t) = (t). hence, one possible physical interpretation degrees freedom system consider actual conguration space entire set helicoidal curves thus parametrised variables 0 r < + 0 < 2, one-to-one correspondence points (r, , z = 0) possible values 0 r < + 0 < 2. point view taken ref. regards nature conguration space system. associated specic choice admissible gauge xing eected constraint z(t) = 0, leaves room non trivial gauge transformations, appropriate choice boundary conditions thus, r(ti) = ri , (ti) = , z(ti) = 0 ; r(tf ) = rf , (tf ) = f , z(tf ) = 0 , (8) particular (ti,f ) = i,f . note consistency boundary conditions requires gauge transformation parameter (t) vanish end points, i.e. (ti,f ) = 0. however, situation suggests another possibility, physical interpretation degrees freedom rather consider actual conguration space system 3 indeed set coordinates (x, y, z) three dimensional euclidean space, two sets physical quantity computed choice boundary conditions depend triplet values (cid:16)r(ti,f ), (ti,f ), z(ti,f )(cid:17) set specic boundary values (cid:16)ri,f , i,f , zi,f(cid:17), knowing quantities (cid:16)ri,f , i,f = i,f gzi,f(cid:17). second interpretation, one decouples say gauge transformations system parameter functions (t) vanish endpoints time ti,f (a distinction which, within interpretation, consistent given boundary conditions), continuous fashion. latter transformations may used transform boundary conditions z(t) would vanish end points ti,f . however, since solely interested propagator physical states, latter quantity may depend gauge invariant combinations ri,f i,f boundary values trajectories. words, physical propagator takes values already actual conguration space gauge orbits rst interpretation degrees freedom model. hence, far calculation physical propagator concerned, action gauge transformations (ti,f ) 6= 0 already accounted dependency variables i,f , rather i,f zi,f separately. thus given second point view, gauge equivalence classes physical trajectories characterized xed end points = ti,f , points (x(t), y(t), z(t)) associated instants distinct ti,f gauge transformed one another arbitrary parameter functions (t) (ti,f ) = 0. except sect.4 specic gauge xing z(t) = 0 used outset, shall thus consider following choice boundary conditions r(ti) = ri , (ti) = , z(ti) = zi ; r(tf ) = rf , (tf ) = f , z(tf ) = zf , (9) second interpretation degrees freedom (x, y, z) associated. indeed, structure hamiltonian gauge invariance model becomes much similar parametrised relativistic scalar particle, results established latter case may readily borrowed calculation physical propagator present system, discussion gribov problems context bfv-brst invariant quantisation. let us consider hamiltonian formulation system polar representation. conjugate momenta simply, appears usual primary constraint pr = r , p = r2h gi , pz = z , canonical hamiltonian also reads, p = 0 . h0 = 1 2 p2 r + 1 2 1 r2 p2 + 1 2 p2 z + 1 2 2r2 +  . (10) (11) (12) consistent time evolution primary contraint p = 0 requires one secondary constraint pz + gp = 0 , (13) together primary constraint p = 0 forms system rst-class constraints, whose poisson bracket equivalently, whole hamiltonian formulation may simply specied {p, pz + gp} = 0 . (14) associated rst-order lagrangian l1 = rpr + p+ zpz + p 1 2 p2 r 1 2 1 r2 p2 1 2 p2 z 1 2 2r2 1p2  , (15) 4 1,2(t) lagrange multipliers two rst-class constraints. however, following redenitions lagrange multipliers lead rst-order lagrangian 1 = , 2 = 2 + , l2 = rpr + p + zpz 1 2 p2 r 1 2 1 r2 p2 1 2 p2 z 1 2 2r2  . (16) (17) reduction hamiltonian formulation consistent gauge in- variances generated rst-class constraints p = pz + gp demonstrated ref., thereby leading so-called fundamental hamiltonian formulation present model. indeed, rst-class constraint p = 0 direct consequence auxilia- ry character degree freedom (t) fact turns simply lagrange multiplier second rst-class constraint = 0, generator u(1) gauge symmetry hamiltonian formulation. thus, (t) actually genuine dynamical degree freedom system. using fundamental hamiltonian formulation, fact made explicit, using rst-order lagrangian (15) would introduce new gauge symmetry generated p whose sole purpose lead arbitrary time dependent shifts variable (t), articially considered genuine dynamical degree freedom, hand two lagrange multipliers 1,2 introduced3. let us note point similar discussion applies original lagrangian formulation model terms cartesian coordinate parametrisation. case, rst-order lagrangian associated fundamental hamiltonian formulation simply reads, l3 = xpx + ypy + zpz 1 2 p2 x 1 2 p2 1 2 p2 z 1 2 2(cid:16)x2 + y2(cid:17)  . (18) however, nature u(1) gauge invariance system, polar parametri- sation far convenient cartesian one, considerations based former. fundamental hamiltonian description, model thus possesses three pairs ca- nonically conjugate phase space coordinates, (r, pr), (, p) (z, pz), subject rst-class constraint = pz + gp = 0 lagrange multiplier , whose dynamics generated rst-class hamiltonian h = 1 2 p2 r + 1 2 1 r2 p2 + 1 2 p2 z + 1 2 2r2 , {h, } = 0 . (19) particular, constraint generator u(1) gauge symmetry phase space symplectic structure dened poisson brackets. innitesimal transformations may exponentiated nite ones, given r = r , p r = pr ; = + , p = p ; z = z + 1 g , p z = pz ; = + 1 g , (20) (t) arbitrary time dependent function parametrising hamiltonian u(1) gauge trans- formations, subject boundary conditions (ti,f ) = 0 either choices boundary conditions (8) (9) applies. 3were one view lagrange multipliers 1,2 genuine degrees freedom, rst-class constraints associated lagrange multipliers would ensue, generating turn new hamiltonian gauge symmetries similar associated described. thus, dynamical status dierent 1,2, genuine dynamical content model indeed solely represented dynamical evolution degrees freedom (r, , z) constraint = pz + gp, namely fundamental hamiltonian formulation system, fact applies gauge invariant systems. 5 since gauge transformations lagrange multiplier independent phase space degrees freedom, general notion teichmuller space, namely set gauge orbits space lagrange multipliers associated rst-class constraints, applies present instance. given boundary conditions (ti,f ) = 0, clear following quantity, = z tf ti dt (t) , (21) dene gauge invariant quantity space lagrange multiplier functions (t). hence, coordinate parametrising teichmuller space system, present case identied entire real line. moreover, quite clear gauge xing space lagrange multiplier functions (t) induces gauge xing entire system phase space formulation, since must (ti,f ) = 0. matter fact, may easily shown admissible gauge xing space (t), thus associated single covering teichmuller space values obtained accounting oriented integration measure teichmuller space, induces admissible gauge xing entire system itself. thus example, choice gauge xing space (t) following set functions selected, (t; ) = tf ti , (22) free parameter taking possible real values once, automatically induces admissible gauge xing system itself. hence, present model, gauge xing may considered terms dynamical degrees freedom (x, y, z), shown choice z(t) = 0 example, may also eected gauge xing space lagrange multiplier functions (t). note also characterization dierent gauge xing procedures possible ensuing gribov problems strongly dependent choice boundary conditions considered study time evolution system congurations. polar parametrisation, hamiltonian equations motion are4 r = pr , pr = p2 r3 2 r ; = p r2 + g , p = 0 ; z = pz + , pz = 0 , (23) subject rst-class constraint = pz + gp = 0. note due global symmetries model decoupled rotations (x, y) plane translations along z axis, angular momentum p linear momentum pz separately conserved quantities time evolution, p(t) = l pz(t) = p. however, gauge invariance constraint = 0 dening physical congurations, generates time dependent translations z coupled time dependent rotations (x, y), brings relation two conserved quantities, p + gl = 0. given choice boundary conditions (9), construction general solution equations motion proceeds follows. first, values rotational energy5 er angular momentum l must determined that6, tf ti = z rf ri du 1 , l = r2her v (u) l2 2u2i f g2(tf ti) +r tf ti , (24) dt r2(t) 4incidentally, (17) (18), hamiltonian reduction whereby conjugate phase space coordinates, pr, p pz rst case, px, py pz second, solved hamiltonian equations motion, leads back precisely original lagrangian formulations (1) (2) model. 5the total energy e system given e = er + p2/2. 6with choice harmonic potential v (r) = 2r2/2, conditions may solved explicitely, ensuing expressions informative, thus given. 6 solution r(t) implicitely dened integral, ti = z r(t) ri du 1 r2her v (u) l2 2u2i .

(26) ti view gauge transformation lagrange multiplier (20), note func- tion (t) appearing solutions parametrises gauge freedom, i.e. gauge redundancy, general solutions equations motion original euler-lagrange equations asso- ciated lagrangian (2). particular, gauge invariant combination (t) = (t) gz(t), given (t) =  + lz ti dt (cid:18) 1 r2(t) + g2(cid:19) , (27) indeed independent lagrange multiplier function (t). however, consistency construction solution, choice lagrange mul- tiplier (t) must associated teichmuller parameter takes value, = z tf ti dt (t) = (zf zi) + gl(tf ti) . (28) hence, gauge xing procedure implemented teichmuller parameter values lagrange multipliers (t) thereby eectively selected include specic value required choice boundary conditions, set gauge orbits system retained gauge xing include specic one solves equations motion choice boundary conditions. clearly, admissible gauge xing, situation never arise since possible values included once. simple remark thus illustrates, classical level already, non admissible gauge xing procedure, thus suering either local global gribov problem, excludes retained congurations system includes large multiplicity certain subsets physically perfectly acceptable thus remain accessible system throughout dynamical evolution single multiplicity gauge orbits. set teichmuller parameter values selected admissible gauge xing choice z(t) = 0 discussed detail sect.4. generally, one-parameter sets functions (t) associated values teichmuller parameter may obtained gauge xing procedure leading equation form = f () , (29) f () given function. indeed, solution (t; f ) condition determined terms single integration constant, later convenience choose value taken (t; f ) = tf , namely f = (tf ; f ). correspondingly, value f runs ti dt(t; f ) takes values certain +, teichmuller parameter (f ) = r tf 7 domain d certain covering domain directly depend function f () (29). within framework, admissible gauge xing related function f () domain d entire real line covering values obtained once. since respective teichmuller spaces identical, let us consider specic examples discussed case parametrised relativistic scalar particle refs.. choice f () = + b , (30) implies, b b , (f ) = b (31) b 1 (cid:18)f + (tf ti) , a(cid:19) ea(ttf ) a(cid:19)(cid:16)1 ea(tf ti)(cid:17) (t; f ) = (cid:18)f + clearly thus denes admissible choice gauge xing, since f varies + corresponding domain d indeed entire real line value obtained once, irrespectively values arbitrary parameters b dening function f (). particular, simplest choice admissible gauge xing obtained f () = 0, thereby leading set lagrange multiplier functions (t) mentioned (22) (f ) = f (tf ti). choice quadratic function f () however, associated non admissible gauge xing. indeed, even though real values teichmuller parameter obtained, obtained twice f runs +, opposite orientations. hence eectively, actual covering teichmuller space implied choice f () vanishes, establishing non admissibility gauge xing, thus possesses global gribov problem, gauge orbit eectively retained. nevertheless, coecient quadratic term f () vanishes, previous class admissible gauge xings recovered. example borrowed ref. shall mention f () = a3 , > 0 . (32) correspondingly, one nds (t; f ) = f f (t tf ) q1 + 2a2 , (f ) = 1 af hq1 + 2a2 f (tf ti) 1i . (33) consequently, non vanishing positive values parameter a, choice leads non admissible gauge xing system. indeed, f runs +, associated domain teichmuller space reduces nite interval d =  single covering. words, even though suer local gribov problem, gauge xing non admissible since suers global one. nevertheless, limit parameter vanishes, admissible gauge xing implied f () = 0 indeed recovered. incidentally, note even already classical level, simple examples illustrate general fact gauge invariant physics described gauge invariant systems independent gauge xing procedure subjected, contrary seems generally believed true. gauge invariance physical quantities gauge invariant systems; also imperative actual space gauge orbits system properly accounted description based gauge xing procedure. achieved admissible gauge xing, even though gauge xing procedure, including suering local global gribov problems, always leads gauge invariant results physical observables. 8 3 dirac quantisation diracs quantisation model simply consists canonical quantisation previous hamiltonian formulation system, constraint gauge invariance = 0 imposed operatorial level order dene physical, i.e. gauge invariant states. convenience, choose work polar parametrisation (r, , z) degrees freedom system, thus requires construction representations associated heisenberg algebra curvilinear coordinates parametrising three dimensional euclidean space dened cartesian coordinates (x, y, z). moreover, given intent computing propagator physical states, shall consider outset conguration space representation canonical commutation relations polar coordinates. purpose, rely recent classication representations heisen- berg algebra arbitrary coordinate systems set arbitrary manifolds. present instance, since euclidean space (x, y, z) simply connected, trivial representation heisenberg algebra exists, dierential operator representation conjugate momenta operators pr, p pz determined metric structure conguration space, expressed polar coordinates ds2 = dr2 + r2d2 + dz2 . (34) consequently, conguration space wave function inner product dened integra- tion measure z + 0 dr r z 2 0 z + dz , (35) (36) conjugate momenta operators represented dierential operators, pr : rr ih r ; p : ih ; pz : ihz , coordinate operators r, z course represented conguration space wave functions simple multiplication associated eigenvalues r, z. yet specify choice quantum hamiltonian system, corres- pondence classical rst-class hamiltonian h (19). however, canonical choice corresponding usual scalar laplacian dierential operator, dened by h = 1 2 1 r pr r pr 1 r + 1 2 1 r2 p2 + 1 2 p2 z + 1 2 2r2 , (37) which, terms representation conjugate momenta operators, also reads, h : h2 2 (cid:20)2 r + 1 r r + 1 r2 2 + 2 z(cid:21) + 2r2 . 1 2 finally, gauge generator operator = pz + g p thus also represented : ih (z + g) . (38) (39) particular, denition, conguration space wave functions gauge invariant states annihilated latter dierential operator. let us rst consider diagonalisation rst-class hamiltonian h, whose set eigenstates thus denes basis full space quantum states system, specic linear subspace gauge invariant physical states annihilated gauge generator . manner classical level, since h, p pz commuting 9 operators, common diagonalisation three operators may found, thereby also diagonalising gauge generator . thus, basis physical states system dened specic subset diagonalising basis states whose eigenvalue vanishes identically. considerations mind, resolution schrodinger equation h2 2 (cid:20)2 r + 1 r r + n 1 r2 2 + 2 z(cid:21) + 1 2 2r2o(r, , z) = e(r, , z) , straightforward enough. eigenvalue spectrum given (40) (41) em,,p = 1 2 p2 + hh2m + || + 1i , < p < +, = 0, 1, 2, . . . = 0,1,2, . . ., corresponding eigenstate conguration space wave functions m,,p(r, , z) =< r, , z|m, , p >= 2h(cid:19)1/2 (cid:18) m!

(53) since rst-class hamiltonian commutes gauge generator, physical state retains quality time evolution generated evolution operator system given time-ordered expression u (tf , ti) = e ti hr tf dt  , (54) (t) stands arbitrary choice lagrange multiplier. nevertheless, fact allow direct evaluation conguration space matrix elements evolution operator physical states would contribute intermediate states, since conguration space eigenstates |r, , z > dene gauge invariant states. hence, appears order evaluate conguration space propagator system restricted gauge invariant states only, one needs rst implement gauge xing procedure contributions gauge variant variables removed, retaining physical states. calculation physical state propagator gauge xing purpose next two sections, showing sect.6 goal may readily reached using physical projector simply within diracs quantisation system require gauge xing whatsoever. 4 reduced phase space quantisation section, consider faddeevs reduced phase space formulation model given gauge xing condition z(t) = 0, choice boundary conditions (8) thus applies. discussed previously, know choice gauge xing admissible7. hence, canonical quantisation corresponding hamiltonian formulation allow 7other reduced phase space gauge xings, z(t) x(t) = 0 xed postive parameter, discussed ref.. 11 calculation physical propagator system, gauge orbits model contribute once. together rst-class generator = pz +gp u(1) gauge symmetry, gauge xing condition = z = 0 , (55) dene set second-class constraints, whose faddeev-popov determinant vanish, {, } = 1 .
