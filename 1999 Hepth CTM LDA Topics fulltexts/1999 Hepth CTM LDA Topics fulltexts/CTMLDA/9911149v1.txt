abstract

we study the spectrum of su (2)  so(2) matrix supersymmetric quantum me-
chanics. we use angular coordinates that allow us to nd an explicit solution of the
gauss law constrains and single out the quantum number n (the lorentz angular mo-
mentum). energy levels are four-fold degenerate with respect to n and are labeled by
nq, the largest n in a quartet. the schrodinger equation is reduced to two dierent
systems of two-dimensional partial dierential equations. the choice of a system is
governed by nq. we present the asymptotic solutions for the systems deriving thereby
the asymptotic formula for the spectrum. odd nq are forbidden, for even nq the spec-
trum has a continuous part as well as a discrete one, meanwhile for half-integer nq
the spectrum is purely discrete. taking half-integer nq one can cure the model from
instability caused by the presence of continuous spectrum.

1 introduction

supersymmetric quantum mechanics describing an so(d) invariant interaction of d su(n)-
matrices has attracted a lot of attention in the last two decades.

the original interest to this model was caused by its description of 1 + 0 reduction of
1 + d dimensional supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory. a reduction of non-supersymmetric
d = 3 yang-mills theory to a mechanical model was considered in the pioneering papers [1].
it was noticed that already for the simplest case of su(2) gauge group one gets a rather
complicated mechanical system with 9 degrees of freedom [2]. this mechanical system was
investigated only within the special ansatze. within one of them the model is reduced to
a model with two degrees of freedom which is still rather non-trivial and exhibits a chaotic
behaviour [1, 3] in the classical case . later on, this model 1 has been investigated in the
quantum case.
it was also proved that this system has a discrete spectrum [4, 5]. this
spectrum possesses a very interesting property  it is in some sense a direct product of two
harmonic oscillators [6]. the possible applications for realistic models see [7].

in the end of 80-th the interest to the matrix quantum mechanics was inspired by an
observation that it describes a regularised membrane theory in d + 2 space-time dimensions
[8, 9, 10, 11]. the membrane theory was supposed to be reached in the limit of large n. since
the membranes were considered within the 11 dimensional supergravity the supersymmetric
version of su(n)so(9) quantum mechanics has to be examined. in contrast to the bosonic
matrix models where the spectrum is purely discrete, in supermembrane matrix models a
continuous spectrum, lling the positive half of the real line was detected [11]. this fact was
considered as a manifestation of the instability of the supermembrane against deformations
into stringlike congurations.

let us also note that more early, in the beginning of the 80s supersymmetric quantum
mechanics (sqm) was proposed as a model for better understanding of supersymmetry
breaking [12]. in this context sqm was considered in [13, 14, 15]. this model is essentially
simpler as compare to the membrane super quantum mechanics, since its bosonic part has
only one degree of freedom.

a renovation of interest to a supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics in the last three
years was motivated by its relation to a description of the dynamics of d-0 branes in su-
perstring theory [16, 17]. moreover, this model in the large n limit pretends to the role of
m-theory [18]. this conjecture has stipulated the recent study of su(n) so(d) supersym-
metric quantum mechanics [19]-[21]. within m-theory there is a very important question of
the existence of normalized eigenfunctions with zero energy, since the zero modes represent
the graviton multiplet of eleven dimensional supergravity. this problem has attracted atten-
tion since the rst paper where the model was introduced. one expected that su(n)so(d)
supersymmetric quantum mechanics has one normalized zero-mode for d = 9, and has none
for d = 2, 3, 5 (only in these dimensions a supersymmetric model can be formulated) [19]-[33].
in this
context the su(2) quantum mechanics was investigated in [19, 20, 21]. the case of arbitrary
n was considered in [27, 28, 30] and n = 3 was considered in [33]. to investigate the zero-

the case of large n is rather involved. the simplest case is the su(2) one.

1nowadays, the supersymmetric version of this model is known as a toy model and it is often considered

to check and clarify new methods.

2

mode problem the born-oppenheimer approximation was applied [19, 20, 21]. this method
allows to nd asymptotic behaviour near innity. therefore, if one does not expect any
singularities at a nite region, one can deduce an existence/nonexistence of normalized zero-
mode from asymptotic behaviour. an eective tool to study the zero-mode problem is an
investigation of a system of rst order dierential equations caused by the supersymmetry
of a desired zero mode. the born-oppenheimer approximation is also applicable to the
study of the rst order dierential equations. recently the authors of [32] have performed an
investigation of zero-mode problem using the rst order dierential equation. the asymptotic
behaviour found in [32] supports a common belief about the existence of normalized zero-
mode in d = 9 and nonexistence in other dimensions.

let us make few comments about chaotic behaviour of matrix models. about classical
dynamics of two-dimensional model [1] see [34, 35]. classical dynamics in bosonic membrane
matrix model was investigated and a chaotic behaviour was demonstrated. later on, in
su(2)  so(2) matrix model a classical chaos-order transition was found [36, 37]. for the
lorentz momentum n small enough (even for small coupling constant) the system exhibits a
chaotic behaviour, for n large enough the system is regular. up to now the question of similar
transition in quantum case remains open. -corrections to the yang-mills approximation
of d-particle dynamics were studied in [38] where a stabilization of the classical trajectories
was shown.

the main task of this paper is to nd the whole spectrum of su(2)so(2) supersymmet-
ric matrix quantum mechanics. in the previous investigations of this model the following
particular results about the spectrum were obtained. continuous spectrum was observed
[11] and the nonexistence of normalized zero mode has been proved [23]. the character of
spectrum plays an important role in stability/instability of the system. let us remind that
according to the commonly accepted opinion this model is unstable. the potential instability
of (super) matrix quantum mechanics is evident from classical consideration. namely, the
potential of matrix models has valleys through which a part of coordinates can escape to in-
nity without increasing the energy. for the bosonic case the classical instability is cured by
quantum uctuations due to which the at directions become closed by conned potentials,
so that nite energy wave functions fall o rapidly and spectrum is purely discrete [6, 4],
that provides stability. the lost of stability in supersimmetric case is caused by additional
contributions to the potential coming from the fermionic degrees of freedom which cancel
the bosonic ones. as a result of this cancellation wave functions are no more conned and
the spectrum becomes continuous [11]. this cancellation takes place on special states, that
means a coexistence of the continuous spectrum and the discrete one. to specify states for
which a cancellation/non cancellation takes place it is convenient to arrange the states into
quartets enumerated by a number nq. upon quantization nq can be integer or half-integer.
our analysis of su(2)  so(2) supersymmetric quantum mechanics shows that there is a
cancellation in the sector with even nq and there is no cancellation for half-integer nq (states
with odd nq are forbidden). as a result, there is only a discrete spectrum in the half-integer
nq sector and the model is stable. the lowest energy in this sector is positive, that means
the supersymmetry is broken in this sector.

our main tool in the detailed study of the spectral problem of su(2) so(2) supersym-
metric quantum mechanics is the proper coordinates, four angles 1 ,2, ,  and two radii

3

f and g. these coordinates have been already used in [36]. in these coordinates we will nd
an explicit solution to the gauss law constrains and single out quantum number n. due to
this parametrisation the spectral problem for a supersymmetric version of the model with 6
degrees of freedom will be reduced to a pair of systems of partial dierential equations in f
and g. the choice of a system is dictated by the value of nq. for half-integer nq we have
just one equation on one function of f and g. for even nq we have three equations on three
functions of f and g.

we present asymptotic solutions of these two systems deriving thereby the asymptotic
formula for the spectrum. for half-integer nq we deal with dierential operator corresponding
to standard potential problem in quantum mechanics and character of the spectrum can be
understood from the form of potential. since we have a conning potential the spectrum is
discrete. we present an asymptotic solution of the schrodinger equation and corresponding
formula for the spectrum. for even nq we have a matrix second order dierential operator.
just for this system a vanishing of the bosonic conning potential takes place on special
states and the matrix dierential operator has the continuous spectrum. to get it we nd
the asymptotic solution of the system of three equations. besides the continuous spectrum
this operator possesses the discrete spectrum. states with integer (half-integer) n belong to
the stable sector if they satisfy the constraint qn = 0 ( qn = 0).

the paper is organised as follows.

in section 2 we explore the algebraic structure of
su(2)  so(2) supersymmetric quantum mechanics in context of energy level degeneracy.
in section 3 we specify the angular su(2)  so(2) parametrization. a special attention
is spared to generalized periodicity.
in section 4 we solve the constrains in the angular
parametrization and present the spectral problem as two sets of two-dimensional partial
dierential equations. in section 5 the spectrum of corresponding dierential operators is
examined. we present asymptotic solutions of the schrodinger equation and corresponding
formula for the spectrum.

2 algebraic structure of su (2)so(2) supersymmetric

quantum mechanics

2.1 the hamiltonian and superalgebra

we consider the system described by the hamiltonian

h = hb + hf ,

hb =

and constrained by the gauss law ja|i = 0. a

the hamiltonian (1) is invariant under su(2) rotations and redundant lorentz rotation
generated by

ja = la + sa,

n = nb + nf ,

la = abcb

nb = a

respectively. the commutation relations for the currents read:

there are two supercharges:

[ja, n] = 0.

hja, jbi = iabcjc,

q =

(7)

and

nq, qo = h.

the supercharges commute with the hamiltonian up to the generator of su(2) rotations
vanishing on the physical states.

the remaining commutators with q and q are the following:

q2 = 0,

q2 = 0,

[q, ja] = h q, jai = 0,
[n, q] =

hn, qi =

[n, h] = 0.

note, that the algebra (8)-(9) is not aected by a shift of n by a constant. as compare with
[32] our n is shifted on 1/4.

2.2 energy level degeneration

2.2.1 the algebra

on the physical states (ja|i = 0) there are three operators commuting with h: q, q and
n. this provides the degeneration of energy levels. in this section we discuss the irreducible
representations ve of the algebra (8) - (9) for a non-zero energy e.

lemma. let |i  ve with e 6= 0 be an eigenvector of h and n, then q|i = 0 or

q|i = 0.

5

proof. suppose that q|i 6= 0 and q|i 6= 0 then one has two additional eigenvectors

of n with the same energy:

n(q|i) = (n 
n( q|i) = (n +

1
2
1
2

)(q|i),
)( q|i).

one can check, that the operator

k = hn +

[q, q]

1
4

is one more casimir of the algebra (8) - (9). by a simple calculation one nds:

qq|i = e(n 

1
4

)|i +

1
2

q q|i,

k|i = e(n +
k(q|i) = e(n 
k( q|i) = e(n +

1

)|i 
2
)(q|i),
)( q|i).

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

for ve to be irreducible the value of the casimir on |i should be equal to its value on q|i
and q|i. from equations (12)-(14) we see that this requires 2

q|i = 0

or

q|i = 0.

since q and q act as raising and lowering operators (eqs.(10), (11)) one can introduce a

label: ve,n where n is the value of n on the vector |i  ker q.

such that

and

so, we nd that ve,n is a vector space spanned by two eigenvectors of n: |1i and |2i

q|1i = 0 = q|2i

n|1i = n|1i, n|2i = (n 

1
2

)|2i.

2.2.2 discrete symmetry

in addition to the algebra (8) - (9) the hamiltonian (1) admits one more symmetry. the
bosonic part of the hamiltonian is invariant under the discrete transformation

1  2.
2remind that if q|i = 0 then |i = q|i with |i = 1

e

q|i.

(15)

6

to extend this symmetry for the supersymmetric case we put:

   
  .

(16)
(17)

the invariance of the hamiltonian and of the commutation relations gives the following
restrictions on , :

one more restriction:

 2 = 2 = i,
 = 1.

 = i

(18)
(19)

comes from imposing the condition for transformation law of supercharges q, q to be ho-
mogeneous.

the system of equations for  and  has a solution (up to an overall sign):

 = ei 
4 ,

 = ei 
4 .

denote the operator generating this symmetry by p , then we have

[p, h] = 0,

[p, j] = 0,

p q   qp = 0, p q  qp = 0,

{p, n} = 3
p 2 = 1.

2p,

(20)

(21)

note, that p acts on the spinor monomials without permutations of spinor factors, be-
cause these permutations are incompatible with the invariance of the anticommutation rela-
tions (2).

figure 1: states in a quartet nq = n

as p ve,n = ve,2n (action of p -operator on the states will be specied below) the irre-
ducible representations of the enlarged algebra (8)-(9)+(20)-(21) are direct sums: ve,nq =
ve,n + ve,2n, where nq is the maximal number of n and 2  n. to avoid doublecounting
one has to restrict the range for n as to exclude n < n + 2 which gives n > 1. in the
exceptional case n = 1: ve,1 = ve,1+2, i.e. for n = 1 one has a two-dimensional instead of
a four-dimensional irreducible representation. the further specication of the range will be
given below.

7

2.3 action of p -operator on the states

a general wave function is a vector of the eight-dimensional fermionic fock space based on
the fermionic vacuum |0i: a|0i = 0. it is useful to arrange the fermionic states according
to their parity as follows:

|i = (cid:16)0 + 1 2 3 + 2 3 1 + 3 1 2 + 0 1 2 3 + 1 1 + 2 2 + 3 3(cid:17)|0i,

where 0, a, 0 and a are some functions of ~1, ~2. the fock space can also be created
by operators a acting on the dual vacuum

(22)

|0) = 1 2 3|0i.

to dene the action of p on |i one has to specify the action of p on the vacuum |0i

(or on |0)). the unique choice that gives non-degenerate p is:

where  is some numerical factor to be xed by the constraint p 2 = 1.

p|0i = |0),

(23)

it is instructive to represent |i as a column of -s with the ordering dictated by eq.(22).

within this notation one can write:

p 2|i = p 2

= p

the constraint p 2 = 1 results in 23 = 1 and gives, according to our choice of  3:

in a matrix form the action of the operator p on the fermionic degrees of freedom can

be represented as follows

check that for these  and  p is correctly dened i.e. it does not depend on the choice of the cyclic vector,
|0i or |0), in the fermionic fock space.

2.4 gauss law and n|i = n|i in components

the gauss law

xes the su(2) transformation properties of the component wave functions a, a. these
are given by:

ja|i = 0

the spin operator ~s acts on fermionic fock states and its action can be easily calculated to
give

la|i = sa|i.

[la, 0] = 0,
[la, b] = iabcc,
[la, 0] = 0,
[la, b] = iabc c.

hence, we conclude that: 1) 0 and 0 are su(2) singlets, 2) ~ = (1, 2, 3) and
( 1, 2, 3) are su(2) triplets. one can check that

~l20 = ~l2 0 = 0,

[~l2, ~] = 2 ~,

[~l2, ~] = 2~

(26)

~ =

as it must be for the scalar and vector representation. the explicit solution of (26) will be
given below after the parametrisation of the conguration space ( ~1, ~2) will be specied.

in the following we shall exploit the eigenstates of n. it is instructive to separate the

fermion number operator nf . let: n|i = n|i then nb|i = (n  nf )|i gives

(27)

nb0 = n0,
nb ~ = (n  1) ~,
nb 0 = (n

2.5 shrodinger equation in components

the fermionic fock space decomposition (22) for |i provides a matrix representation for
shrodinger equation h|i = e|i. taking |i as a column (see (24)) one deduces h in a
block-diagonal form:

where

on physical states (~j|i = 0) the component equations for su(2) triplet ~ (

 i 30 + hb3 = e3.

(30)

let us apply l1 to (30):

then by using the commutation relations (26) and [la, b] = iabcc one gets the third
shrodinger equation

il1( 30) + l1(hb3) = el13,

and so on.

i 20 + hb2 = e2

therefore, we are left with two sets of equations:

( hb0 + i(~ ~) = e0
hb3  i 30 = e3

hb 0  i(~~) = e 0
3 + i3 0 = e 3

the range for the new coordinates is 0  1, 2 < 2,  <  < 0, 0   < /2, f, g > 0
the su(2) angular variables 1, , 2 are similar to the euler angles. the su(2) adjoins
i can be viewed as the r3 vectors ~i. denote ~ex, ~ey, ~ez the unit vectors of the xed coordinate
system. ~en = ~ez  (~1  ~2) is a vector along the knot-line (the line of intersection of the
(~1, ~2) and (x, y) planes). the rst rotation on 2, around the z-axis matches ~en with ~x.
after this rotation the vector ~e3 = ~1  ~2 falls into the (y, z) plane, with (~e3)y < 0. the
second rotation around the x-axis in clockwise direction on the angle , matches ~e3 with ~z
that gives  <  < 0. these two rotations place the pair ~1, ~2 into the (x, y) plane and
6 (~1, ~2) <  ( (~e3)z is positive).
to x the third angle 1, let us take a pair (~1, ~2) in (x, y) plane with |~1| = r1 , |~2| = r2
and 6 (~1, ~2) =  and examine its orbit under the action of the rotations around the z-axis.
this orbit is the set {(r1 cos , r1 sin ), (r2 cos( + ), r2 sin( + )} with 0   < 2. we call
a pair (~1, ~2) as so(2)-orthogonal if

1
12

1 + 1

22

2 = 0,

(35)

i = (~i)x, 2

i = (~i)y. the so(2)-orthogonality condition for the points of the orbit

here 1
reads:

tan 2 = 

r2
2 sin 2

r2
1 + r2

2 cos 2

.

hence, at any orbit there are four so(2)-orthogonal pairs (~1, ~2). one of these pairs has ~1
lying in the fourth quadrant i.e. 1
1  0. this pair we call the special one. for any
pair (~1, ~2) we dene 1 as the angle of rotations around the ~z-axis that matches (~1, ~2),
with the special pair. the range for 1 is obviously 0  1 < 2.

1 > 0, 2

figure 3: su(2) and so(2)

to parametrise the special pair (~1, ~2) note that the numbers a
1, 2

i form also a pair of
2}, so that arg u2 =
2 . the remaining coordinates {f, g, } are dened to be the polar coordinates for

so(2) (lorentz) orthogonal vectors: u1 = {1
arg u1 + 
u1 and u2:

1, 1

1 = f cos 
2 = f sin

2 = g cos .

(36)

as the pair is the special one the ranges for {f, g, } are 0   < /2 and f, g > 0.
to summarize, we have proved that by the su(2) rotation dened by the euler-like
angles 1, 2 and  any pair (~1, ~2) is matched with the special pair which is parametrised
by f, g, . the special case of an angular momentum parametrisation was proposed in [7].

3.2 generalized periodicity

to extend the ranges for the angular variables i up to r1 axis we employ the usual 2
periodicity conditions for i. as to the  angle with 0   < /2 the situation is more
subtle.
2 , 1) (2
and  are irrelevant for the subsequent discussion). by means of (33) this set parametrise
the pair

let us take a point with so(2) angle coordinate outside the range: (f, g,  + 

1,2 = u +(1)1,2u(1), u(1) = e

i
2 13

where

1 = 1f sin  + 2g cos ,
2 = 1f cos   2g sin .

(37)

the pair (~1, ~2) is so(2)-orthogonal but not special. what are the true coordinates for
1,2?

in complex notation (29) these read:

 =   e

i

(f, g,  +

2

(38)

below we shall call (38) the generalized periodicity condition in .

3.3

p symmetry in su (2)  so(2) parametrisation

on bosonic degrees of freedom p operator acts as ~1  ~2. here we describe this action
in terms of the new coordinates. let us denote ~1 = ~2, ~2 = ~1, then p ~i = ~i. we also
shall indicate by primes all the objects referred to the pair (~1, ~2).

by denition one has ~e 3 = ~e3 and ~e n = ~en hence, 2 =  + 2. after 2 rotation
~e 3 lies in the (x, y) plane with (~e 3)z = (~e3)z and (~e 3)y = (~e3)y. this yields:  =   .
let us compare the results of two rst rotations for both the pairs (~1, ~2) and (~1, ~2)
that lie in (x, y) plane (we still denote the resulting pairs as (~1, ~2), (~1, ~2) ). by means
of a simple algebra one nds that for 2 and  given above:

i.e. (~1, ~2) and (~1, ~2), diers by the rotation on  around the y-axis. thus on the (x, y)
plane one has:

1 = 1

2 = 1

1 = 2

one can rewrite these relations in polar coordinates (we use complex notation):

if

~1 = r1ei,
then ~ 1 = r2ei(),

~2 = r2ei
~ 2 = r1ei().

(40)
(41)

let 1 be the angle that matches (~1, ~2) with the special pair (r1ei(+1), r2ei(+1)). the

pair (r2ei(+1), r1ei(+1)) is also a special one and

(r2ei(+1), r1ei(+1)) = ei(1+)(r2ei(), r1ei())

13

that yields 1 = 1   = 1 +  due to periodicity in 1. the f, g and  are easily
found to be: f = f , g = g and  = /2  .

4 shrodinger equation in su (2)so(2) parametrisation

4.1 n = n and gauss law  an explicit solution
the su(2) so(2) variables provide the explicit solution for wave function |i dependence
on angular variables.

for nb one deduces

nb = i




,

i.e. nb eigenfunctions are the plane waves eik. applying periodicity condition (38) four
times we nd that wave functions components have to be 2 periodic so k must be an integer.
thus, from eqs.(27) it follows that n can be integer or half-integer and

0
~
0
~0







for integer n : n 

for half-integer n : n 

.

(43)

in the following we shall concentrate on the case of integer n, the half-integer case will be
sometimes discussed for the sake of completeness.

the components of su(2) generators la depend only on euler angles:

these expressions coincide with the usual euler angles parametrisation for so(3) generators
[39] up to some modication of variables.

for 0 ( 0) eq.(26) shows that 0 does not depend on (1, 2, ) and has the form:

for integer n :

for half-integer n :

0 = einf0(f, g)
0 = ei(n 3

2 ) f0(f, g).

(48)

from (46) one nds 3 ( 3) to depend only on  and 1. thus, taking 3(f, g, , , 1) =

p f (f, g, )(, 1) from (47) one has:

the solutions of (49) are spherical functions y1,m with m = 0, +1,1. taking for y1,m the
explicit expressions we get:

for integer n :

for half-integer n :

3 = ei(n1)(cid:16)f 0 cos  + f + sin ei1 + f  sin ei1(cid:17) ,
3 = ei(n1/2) (cid:16) f 0 cos  + f + sin ei1 + f  sin ei1(cid:17)

(50)

(51)

(52)

where the harmonics f 0, f +, f  are functions of f and g only.

we list the remaining components of ~ (

~) which are restored by acting of la on 3 ( 3).

it is useful to slightly modify the basis by passing to the eigenvectors of l3 (s3):

|i = (0 + ( 1 + i 2) 3 + +( 1  i 2) 3 + 3 1 2

+ 0 + ( 1 + i 2) + +( 1  i 2) + 3 3)|0i.

(53)

in this basis  are achieved by using the raising and lowering operators l = l1  il2 as

 = 

i

l3,

+ = 

i

similarly for the tildes. finally, we have
for integer n:

ei(n1)ei2 (cid:16)f 0 sin   f +(cos  + 1)ei1  f (cos   1)ei1(cid:17) ,
ei(n1)ei2 (cid:16)f 0 sin   f +(cos   1)ei1  f (cos  + 1)ei1(cid:17) ,

further restrictions and symmetry properties of f -s come from the generalized -pe-

riodicity (38). we shall examine the case of integer n, half-integer case is similar.

15

applying (38) twice we obtain restrictions dependent on n:

even n,

n = 2k  f 0 = 0,
odd n  f0 = f + = f  = 0.

applying (38) once we get that only the following functions f are consistence with the

general periodicity:

n = 4k :

n = 4k + 2 :

f 0 = 0
f0(f, g) = f0(g, f )
f +(f, g) = f +(g, f )
f (f, g) = f (g, f ),
f 0 = 0
f0(f, g) = f0(g, f )
f +(f, g) = f +(g, f )
f (f, g) = f (g, f ),

n = 4k + 1 :

f0 = f + = f  = 0
f 0(f, g) = f 0(g, f ),

n = 4k + 3 :

f0 = f + = f  = 0
f 0(f, g) = f 0(g, f ).

4.2 hamiltonian

(59)

(60)

(61)

(62)

we deduce the explicit expression for hb in new variables as follows. at rst, we calculate
the metric tensor g: abijda
j = gdxdx with ~x = (f, g, , 1, 2, ). at second,
we obtain the hamiltonian as the laplace-beltrami operator for the metric g plus the
potential term

f and 

note that there are terms with the rst order derivatives

g collected in d.
although the coecients for these terms are functions of f , g only, these terms are absent in
the usual quantization of the two-dimensional toy model [1], as in the pure bosonic case as in
the fermionic one4. these rst order derivatives in couple with the zoo of angular dependent
terms in (63) radically modify the potential.



4.3 shrodinger equation for harmonics

now we substitute the harmonic expansion for the wave function n into the system (31)
with the explicit hamiltonian hb given in (63). the result is:

remind, that for any e 6= 0 eigenfunctions are combined into the quartets ve,nq with
quantum numbers nq, nq  1/2,nq + 2,nq + 3/2. to examine the spectrum it is sucient
to search for any one of these four functions constrained by the additional constraints coming
from supercharges q and q. next we search for dierential equations for these constraints.

for even n :

expressed solely in terms of f  and f0. hence, for

now we are in position to examine the restrictions on ve,nq coming from qn = 0 and
qn = 0. as it was shown above n can be integer or half-integer. we start with the case of

integer nq. (we omit the subindex q below). the content of ven is the following: n, n 1
with qn = 0 and qn+2 = 0. both n and n + 2 have the same parity
n+2 and 
so according to (80) odd n are forbidden. for n even the constraint qn = 0 results in pde
(81). we shall examine this case in sec. 5.4.
next we turn to a half-integer n = n + 1

and
n+1 with qn = 0, qn+1 = 0. this time one of two numbers either n or n + 1 will
be odd. let, for instance, n to be odd. as follows from (79) qn = 0 and the only equation
to be solved is the shrodinger equation (64). it will be examined in the next section.

by using the born-oppenheimer method in the region f  g, as it is adopted in current lit-
erature. this procedure yields an approximate formulae for the spectrum and wave function.
note, that in the current variables kk is proportional to r f 0f 0jdf dg.

to eliminate the rst derivatives term d we search for the wave function in the form

f 0 =

we start with introducing an extra parameter a as follows: f  f /a2 and g  ag and
expanding over the powers of a. separating the variables as 0 = m(g|f )k(f ) we get the
leading term as

5.4 even nq and continuous spectrum
here we apply the born-oppenheimer method in the region f  g to the system (65) -
(67). our aim is to employ the toy-model-like ansatz for the wave function and justify the
appearance of the continuous spectrum [11].

for f  g the leading part in the system (65) - (67) reads

f0 = ef +

f0 = ef 

taking f  = f + we nd that (86) and (87) coincide. the reduced system reads:

( + d)f + +

(88)

(89)

it is obvious that (88) and (89) will coincide as well if one put f + = 12

f0.

in the asymptotic region the rescaling yields d  1/(4g2) and we are left with the

equation

has normalisable solutions for m =

(m + 1/2), where 1/2 is very important (not 1 !).

the next step is to solve the equation


f 2 + o( 1/f 2)) = e.

(

we conrm that for m = 0 the linear term from the energy m is fully cancelled by the

linear potential

thus producing the continuous spectrum.

6 discussion and conclusion

the results obtained in section 5 are collected in the table presented in fig.3. states from
the quartets are situated along the horizontal lines. eigenvalues of n for the states in a
quartet nq are nq, nq  1/2 and nq + 2,ng + 3/2. each item of the quartet can be obtained
from any other one by the action of supercharges or the permutation operator p . our results
show that odd nq are forbidden, for even nq the spectrum has a continuous part as well as
a discrete one, meanwhile for half-integer nq the spectrum is purely discrete.

table 3 demonstrates that there is a possibility to put a superselection rule to exclude
the presence of the continuous spectrum. namely, taking any state from quartet with half-
integer nq one gets with guarantee the state of discrete spectrum. one can also specify the
purely discrete sector by using the supercharges, i.e. the states with integer n satisfy the
constraint qn = 0, meanwhile states with half-integer n satisfy qn = 0.

besides the continuous spectrum su(2)  so(2) matrix supersymmetric quantum me-
chanics possesses one more distinguish feature as compared with the bosonic counterpart.
this concerns the behaviour of the wave functions in half-integer nq sector, where spectrum
is purely discrete. the expression (84) for the wave function illuminates this dierence. it
is not a dicult task to realize that in the pure bosonic case the maximum of the wave
function appears at the minimum of the classical potential (f g)2, i.e. at the bottom of the
valley f = 0 as it should be by the semiclassical reasons. for the supersymmetric case the
picture is quite dierent, the classical equilibrium line have nothing to do with the maximum
of the wave function (84), this time the wave function tends to zero as f  0. the origin
of this transformation is the reecting wall like 1
f 2 created by the activation of the su(2)
angular degrees of freedom for the triplet (l = 1) solution.

let us note that we have obtained only the asymptotic formula for spectrum. numeric
it
investigations (see [40] and references therein) allow to trust the asymptotic formula.
would be interesting to perform numerical calculations also in our case. it would be also
interesting to study -corrections [38] to the spectrum.

it was argued [36] that the holographic feature of the matrix theory can be related with
the repulsive feature of energy eigenvalues in the quantum chaotic system. relation between
chaos and holography has been discussed recently in [41]. quantum chaos in supersymmetric
matrix quantum mechanics will be a subject of future investigationss.
