abstract

the recently introduced quantum antibracket is further generalized allowing for the
dening odd operator q to be arbitrary. we give exact formulas for higher quantum
antibrackets of arbitrary orders and their generalized jacobi identities. their appli-
cations to bv-quantization and bfv-brst quantization are then reviewed including
some new aspects.

introduction

in [1] we introduced new quantum objects called quantum antibrackets, which are operator
mappings from classical antibrackets exactly like commutators are mappings from poisson
brackets. classical antibrackets were introduced in [2, 3] and have mainly been used in
the lagrangian bv-quantization of gauge theories [3]. apart from providing an operator
version of the bv-quantization [1], the quantum antibrackets have been used to give a
new kind of quantum master equation for generalized quantum maurer-cartan equations
for arbitrary open groups [4]. remarkably enough the quantum antibrackets used in these
master equations were generalized ones, which neither satisfy the jacobi identities nor
leibniz rule. for such brackets one has to use a hierarchy of higher quantum antibrackets
dened in a denite way. in their rst form they were introduced already in [1] which is
valid for the restricted case when all operators commute. a more general form valid for
operators in arbitrary involutions were given in [4]. (in [5] it was also shown that all these
results have, at the classical level, a dual version in terms of new types of generalized
poisson brackets.)
in [6] the quantum antibrackets were generalized to sp(2)-brackets
dened in analogy to the sp(2)-antibrackets used in the sp(2)-version of bv-quantization
[7, 8, 9] and most of the above results were then generalized.

here we review these results with some natural further developments. we start from
the most general quantum antibracket as dened in [1] and give then systematically all
their main properties. finally we review the applications considered so far. the quantum
antibrackets and their exact properties are given in sections 2 and 3, and the main part
of the presented results are new. in section 4 we consider then the restriction to ordinary
quantum antibrackets which satisfy all properties as required by the conventional classical
antibrackets.
in sections 5 and 6 we review the applications to bv-quantization and
bfv-brst quantization respectively including some new aspects. finally, in section 7
we give some remarks on the corresponding properties and applications of quantum sp(2)-
antibrackets.

2 general quantum antibrackets

the general quantum antibracket is dened by the expression [1]

(f, g)q 

1

2 (cid:16)[f, [q, g]]  [g, [q, f ]](1)(f +1)(g +1)(cid:17) ,

(2.1)

where f and g are any operators with grassmann parities (f )  f and (g)  g
respectively. q is an odd operator, (q) = 1. the commutators on the right-hand side is
the graded commutator dened by

[f, g]  f g  gf (1)f g ,

f, g.

(2.2)

the quantum antibracket (2.1) satises the properties:

1) grassmann parity

((f, g)q) = f + g + 1.

(2.3)

1

2) symmetry

3) linearity

(f, g)q = (g, f )q(1)(f +1)(g +1).

(f + g, h)q = (f, h)q + (g, h)q,

(for f = g).

4) if one entry is an odd/even parameter  we have

(f, )q = 0 for any operator f.

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

all these properties agree exactly with the corresponding properties of the classical an-
tibracket (f, g) for functions f and g. however, the classical antibracket satises in addition

5) the jacobi identities

6) and leibniz rule

(f, (g, h))(1)(f +1)(h+1) + cycle(f, g, h)  0,

(f g, h)  f (g, h)  (f, h)g(1)g (h+1) = 0.

(2.7)

(2.8)

these properties are not satised by the quantum antibracket (2.1) in its general form.
instead we have

(f, (g, h)q)q(1)(f +1)(h+1) + cycle(f, g, h) =

=

1
6

(1)f +g+h(cid:26)(cid:18)[f, [g, [h, q2]]] +

1
2

[[f, [g, [h, q]]], q](cid:19) (1)f h+

+ (cid:18)[f, [h, [g, q2]]] +

1
2

[[f, [h, [g, q]]], q](cid:19) (1)h(f +g)(cid:27) + cycle(f, g, h),

and

(f g, h)q  f (g, h)q  (f, h)qg(1)g (h+1) =

=

1

2 (cid:16)[f, h][g, q](1)h(g+1) + [f, q][g, h](1)g(cid:17) .

(2.9)

(2.10)

in our previous treatments we have only considered nilpotent q-operators which is a
natural restriction from the point of view of bv-quantization. here we leave q unrestricted
in the general treatment. one may then notice that any odd operator q satises the
algebra

[q, q] = 2q2,

[q2, q2] = [q2, q] = 0,

(2.11)

which directly follows from the denition (2.2). in terms of the quantum antibracket (2.1)
q satises the algebra

(q, q)q = (q2, q2)q = (q2, q)q = 0.

notice also the relation

(f, q)q =

3
2

[f, q2],

f.

2

(2.12)

(2.13)

a nonzero q2 complicates some formulas. for instance, instead of (20) in [1] we have here

[q, (f, g)q] = ([q, f ], g)q + (f, [q, g])q(1)f +1 

(1)f (cid:16)[f, [g, q2]] + [g, [f, q2]](1)f g(cid:17) = [[q, f ], [q, g]] 



1
2

(1)f (cid:16)[f, [g, q2]] + [g, [f, q2]](1)f g(cid:17) .

(2.14)

in our derivation of the generalized jacobi identities (2.9) we have used the relation

(f, (g, h)q)q = [[f, q], (g, h)q]] +

1
2

[q, [f, (g, h)q]](1)f ,

(2.15)

which directly follows from the denition (2.1) (further details are given below).

3 hierarchy of general higher order antibrackets and

generalized jacobi identities.

although the quantum antibracket (2.1) in its general form does not satisfy the jacobi
identities and leibniz rule, we may provide for a systematic description of its algebraic
properties in terms of higher order quantum antibrackets.

in [1, 4] it was shown that higher order quantum antibrackets in terms of operators
in involution may be dened in terms of a generating operator and that the generating
operator determine the jacobi identities. this construction may in fact be generalized
to such an extent that it allows us to dene general higher order quantum antibrackets
in terms of arbitrary operators. for the general case we need then the following two
generating operators (in refs.[1, 4] q was considered to be nilpotent, q2 = 0.)

q()  eaqea, q2()  eaq2ea,

where a is an even operator dened by

a = faa,

(3.1)

(3.2)

where fa, a = 1, 2, . . ., are arbitrary operators with grassmann parities a  (fa) and
where a are parameters with grassmann parities (a) = a. (in [1] {fa} was a set of
commuting operators.) we have the equalities

q() =



xn=0

qn, q2() =

q2
n,



xn=0

(3.3)

where

q0  q, qn 

[   [[q, a],    , a]n for n  1,

1
n!
1
n!

q2

0  q2, q2

n 

[   [[q2, a],    , a]n for n  1,

(3.4)

where the last index n indicates that the expression involves n commutators. we dene
the general higher order quantum antibrackets by (cf [1])

(fa1, . . . , fan)q   q()

(fa1, . . . , fan)q =

[   [[q, fa1 ],    , fan],

(3.6)

where the sum is over all possible orders of a1, . . . , an (n! terms) with appropriate sign
factors obtained from the corresponding reordering of the monomial a1    an (this follows
from the last equality in (3.5)). the higher antibrackets satisfy the properties

(. . . , fa, fb, . . .)q = (1)(a+1)(b+1)(. . . , fb, fa, . . .)q,
((fa1 , fa2, . . . , fan)q) = a1 +    + an + 1.

to the lowest orders we get explicitly

n = 2 :

(fa, fb)q =

n = 3 :

(fa, fb, fc)q =

1

2 (cid:16)[fa, [q, fb]]  [fb, [q, fa]](1)(a+1)(b+1)(cid:17) ,

(1)(a+1)(c+1) ([[[q, fa], fb], fc](1)ac+

1
6

+[[[q, fc], fb], fa](1)b(a+c) + cycle(a, b, c)(cid:17) ,

where the expression for n = 2 is exactly the antibracket (2.1). for nilpotent q and
commuting operators fak (3.6) reduces to the higher quantum antibrackets in [1] (eq.(33)).
if furthermore fak are functions of some coordinates and q a nilpotent dierential operator
then (3.6) on unity yields the classical higher antibrackets considered in [10].

the higher order quantum antibrackets may also be expressed recursively in terms of

the next lower ones. the precise relations may be obtained from the recursion relation

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

this inserted into (3.5) yields

(fa1, . . . , fan)q =

qn =

to the lowest order we have explicitly (this expression was also given in [4])

(fa, fb, fc)q =

(1)(a+1)(c+1)(cid:16)[fa, (fb, fc)q](1)b+a(c+1) + cycle(a, b, c)(cid:17) .

(3.12)

in order to derive generalized jacobi identities we notice rst that the denition (2.1)

of the antibracket yields the relation (cf (2.15))

(fak , (fa1, . . . , fak1, fak+1, . . . , fan)q)q = [[fak , q], (fa1 , . . . , fak1, fak+1, . . . , fan)q] +

+

1

[q, [fak , (fa1 , . . . , fak1, fak+1, . . . , fan)q](1)ak .

(3.13)

this combined with the recursion relation (3.10) implies then

n

(fak , (fa1, . . . , fak1, fak+1, . . . , fan)q)q(1)dk,n =

[[fk, q], (fa1 , . . . , fak1, fak+1, . . . , fan)q](1)dk,n

(3.14)

the rst sum on the right-hand side may be expressed in terms of higher antibrackets by
means of the identities (cf [1])

(3.21)

which may be rewritten as (2.9).

4 ordinary quantum antibrackets

it is natural to impose a restriction such that the quantum antibrackets satisfy the ja-
cobi identities (2.7) and leibniz rule (2.8). such antibrackets we call ordinary quantum
antibrackets. this requires of course that all higher order quantum antibrackets vanish
(from n = 3). the precise conditions are best extracted from the explicit expressions (2.9)
and (2.10). from (2.10) we nd that the quantum antibracket (2.1) satises leibniz rule
(2.8), i.e.

(f g, h)q  f (g, h)q  (f, h)qg(1)g (h+1) = 0,

(4.1)

6

for two classes of operators: the class of commuting operators or the class of operators
commuting with q. since the antibracket is zero in the latter case we consider only
maximal sets of commuting operators denoted m from now on.

the jacobi identities (2.7) are satised provided the operator q satises the condition

[f, [g, [h, q2]]] +

1
2

[[f, [g, [h, q]]], q] = 0,

f, g, h  m.

(4.2)

(this condition is trivially satised for the class of operators commuting with q.) first
we notice that for the class of commuting operators, m, the quantum antibracket (2.1)
reduces to

(f, g)q = [f, [q, g]] = [[f, q], g],

f, g  m.

(4.3)

in order to use this expression repeatedly like in the jacobi identities, we must require

(f, g)q  m,

f, g  m,

which is equivalent to

[f, [g, [h, q]]] = 0,

f, g, h  m.

however, this together with (4.2) requires then

[f, [g, [h, q2]]] = 0,

f, g, h  m.

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

thus, ordinary nontrivial quantum antibrackets are dened for a class of commuting op-
erators m. it is naturally dened by (4.3) where q must satisfy the conditions (4.5) and
(4.6).

in order to give explicit solutions we consider like in [1, 5] a supersymmetric manifold
}, a = 1, . . . , n,
a) = a + 1. their canonical

of dimension (2n, 2n) spanned by the canonical coordinates {xa, x
with grassmann parities a  (xa) = (pa) and (x
commutation relations have the nonzero part

a) = (p

a, pa, pa

[xa, pb] = iha
b ,

[x

a, pb

] = ihb
a.

(4.7)

let now the class of commuting operators m be all functions of xa and x
q-operator satises then the conditions (4.5) and (4.6):

a. the following

q = papa

(1)a .

in terms of this q the quantum antibracket (2.1) becomes

(ih)2(f, g)q = f


 a a

 g  g


 a a

 f (1)(f +1)(g+1),

(4.8)

(4.9)

which exactly agrees with the standard classical antibracket in which xa and x
a are elds
and antields [3]. the q-operator (4.8) is nilpotent (q2 = 0). however, the q-operator is
not uniquely determined by the quantum antibracket. in fact, the quantum antibracket
(4.9) is also obtained from the q-operator

q = papa

(1)a + ihf a(x, x)pa(1)a + ihf 

a (x, x)pa

(1)a+1  (ih)2g(x, x)

7

(4.10)

for any functions f a, f 
a. (the normalization
chosen in (4.10) is appropriate for applications to bv-quantization.) the q-operator
(4.10) is in general not nilpotent.

a and g of the commuting operators xa and x

in terms of general coordinates x a, a = 1, . . . , 2n, the solution of the condition (4.5)

is

q = 

1
2

eab(x)pbpa(1)b + ihf a(x)pa(1)a  (ih)2g(x),

(4.11)

where pa ((pa) = (x a)  a) is the conjugate momentum operator to x a ([x a, pb] =
iha
in order to also satisfy condition (4.6), q2 must be at most quadratic in the
conjugate momenta. this requires

b).

eaddebc (1)(a+1)(c +1) + cycle(a, b, c) = 0.

(4.12)

the q-operator (4.11) inserted into (2.1) for the class of operators which are functions of
x a yields the quantum antibracket

(ih)2(f, g)q = f


 a eabb g,

f, g  m,

(4.13)

where a  /x a. one may easily check that the jacobi identities of (4.13) requires
(4.12) (cf [11]). the operator (4.11) is like (4.10) in general not nilpotent. (in fact, (4.10)
is (4.11) in darboux coordinates xa and x
a.) notice that if q has terms involving third or
higher powers of pa then even the general condition (4.2) does not allow for any solutions
since the rst term in (4.2) involves rst order derivatives of f, g, h while the second term
involves second derivatives.

5 operator version of bv-quantization

the lagrangian bv-quantization of general gauge theories is formulated within the path
integral formulation. the classical antibrackets play a crucial role in this formulation.
here we show that the quantum antibrackets provide for the appropriate algebraic tools
in a corresponding operator formulation.
in this
construction it is the ordinary quantum antibrackets that provide for the relevant frame-
work. we have therefore to restrict ourselves to a maximal commuting set of operators.
this is just a polarization into elds and their momenta. the eld operators are then the
maximal set to be chosen. the crucial ingredient in the bv-quantization is the quantum
master equation

(these results were given in [1, 6].)

e

i

h w = 0,

(5.1)

where  is an odd, second order dierential operator. w is the master action. within
the operator formulation (5.1) is replaced by

where q is the odd operator that enters the denition of the quantum antibracket. the
bv-formulation requires q to be

q|wi = 0,

(5.2)

1. maximally quadratic in the momenta

8

2. nilpotent (q2 = 0)

3. hermitian

4. reduce to the dierential operator  in the schrodinger picture which should have

no h-dependence.

the rst and last condition requires q to be of the form (4.10) or (4.11) with h-independent
functions. starting from the general q-operator (4.11) we nd then the general hermitian,
nilpotent solution

q  

1
2

1/2paeabpb1/2(1)b  (ih)2g(x),

(5.3)

where (x) is the volume density operator. q is hermitian if , x a, g and eab are
hermitian, and p 

a = (1)apa. the h-dependence in q is chosen such that

hx|q|wi = (ih)2hx|wi,

where

 = 0 + g(x), 0 

1
2

1a  eabb(1)a,

(5.4)

(5.5)

where in turn x a now are classical elds. notice that pa = ih1/2a  1/2(1)a
since the eigenstates |xi are normalized according to

z |xi(x)dxhx| = 1.

(5.6)

the most general -operator considered so far is 0 [11]. we do not know to what extent
a nonzero g(x) may be used. notice that the nilpotence of  requires 0 to be nilpotent
and g to satisfy

0g = 0, 0

1
2

(1)a1(cid:16)aeab(cid:17)  g

the equivalence between (5.1) and (5.2) follows if we choose


 a eab = 0.

(5.7)

hx|wi = exp {

i
h

w(x)}  |wi = exp {

i
h

w(x)}1/2|0ip .

(5.8)

notice the normalization hx|1/2|0ip = 1.

the partition function z, i.e. the path integral of the gauge xed action, is given by
z = hx |wi, where |wi is the master state and |x i a gauge xing state both satisfying
the quantum master equation (5.2). |wi and |x i have the general form

|wi = exp(cid:26) i

h

w(x)(cid:27)1/2|0ip ,

|x i = exp(cid:26)

i
h

x (x, )(cid:27)1/2|0ip ,

(5.9)

where  are lagrange multipliers and  their conjugate momenta. the vacuum state
|0ip  = |0ip  |0i satises pa|0ip  = |0ip  = 0. by means of the extended eigenstates
|x, i satisfying the completeness relations

z |x, i(x)dxdhx, | = 1,

9

(5.10)

and hx, |1/2|0ip, = 1, the partition function z = hx |wi becomes explicitly

z = hx |wi = z (x)dxd exp(cid:26) i

h(cid:20)w(x) + x (x, )(cid:21)(cid:27)

(5.11)

where w and x in the path integral denotes the master action and gauge xing ac-
tions, hx, |w(x)1/2|0ip, and hx, |x (x, )1/2|0ip, respectively, which both satisfy
the quantum master equation (5.1). this agrees with the results in [11, 9]. the path
integral (5.11) is invariant under the anticanonical transformation

x a = (x a, w + x ),

(5.12)

where  is an odd constant. it is also invariant under changes of the gauge xing function x
in accordance with the general invariance of the quantum master equation. innitesimally
we have invariance under

x = (x , f )  ihf,

where f is an odd function.

in order to illustrate the above generalized bv-quantization we give a detailed explicit
treatment in terms of the darboux coordinates xa and x
a [1]. in the bv-quantization they
are viewed as elds and antields. the nilpotent and hermitian q-operator in conventional
bv-quantization is given by (4.8). notice the relation

where

(5.17)

the path integral of the gauge xed action, z, is given by z = h|si, where |si is
the master state (5.17) and |i a gauge xing state also satisfying the quantum master
equation (5.16). i.e. q|i = 0. in the standard case we have explicitly

where the operators have the hermiticity properties

|i = expnh2[q, (x)]o |0ipx ,

and where the vacuum states satisfy

pa|0ipp = pa

|0ipp = 0,

pa|0ipx = x

a|0ipx = 0, q|0ipp = q|0ipx = 0.

(5.20)

note that s(x, x) and (x) belong to the class of commuting operators. note also that
|i satises

z = h|si = pxh0| exp {h2[q, (x)]} exp {ih1s(x, x)}|0ipp =

a  a(x)),

where the last equality is obtained by inserting the completeness relations3

z |x, xidxdxhx, x| = z |x, pidxdphx, p| = 1,

(5.22)

(5.23)

and the properties

(5.24)

where n+ (n) is the number of bosons (fermions) among the xa operators. eq.(5.22)

operator  follows from

z = h|z 1

d exp {h2[q, ]}h2[q, ] exp {h2[q, ]}|si = 0, (5.25)

since |si and |i satisfy the master equation (5.16).

6 quantum antibrackets within general bfv-brst quan-

tization

within the hamiltonian formulation of general gauge theories there are rst class con-
straints a = 0 where a by denition are variables in arbitrary involution with respect to
the poisson bracket on the considered symplectic manifold, i.e.

{a, b} = u c

ab c,

(6.1)

where the structure coecients u c
ab may be arbitrary functions. in [13] it was shown that
the algebra (6.1) on a ghost extended manifold always may be embedded in one single
real, odd function , the bfv-brst charge, in such a way that {, } = 0 in terms
of the extended poisson bracket. the corresponding quantum theory is consistent if the
corresponding odd, hermitian operator  is nilpotent, i.e. 2 = 0. for a nite number of

3note that for odd n the states in (5.23), (5.24) do not have a denite grassmann parity [12].

11

degrees of freedom such a solution always exists and is of the form [14] (n is the rank of
the theory and a are the hermitian constraint operators)

fying

(ca) = ca, p 

a = (1)apa.

the grassmann parities are

a  (a),

(ca) = (pa) = a + 1.

(6.4)

(6.5)

the operators bib1
a1ai+1 in (6.3), whose explicit form we do not give here, contain the
original operators and are such that  is hermitian and nilpotent. (in (6.3) the ghost
operators are weyl ordered which means that i are all hermitian.) if the ghosts ca are
assigned ghost number one and pa ghost number minus one,  in (6.2) has ghost number
one. notice the relation

[g, ] = ih, g  

1
2

(paca  capa(1)a ) ,

(6.6)

where g is the ghost charge.

the brst charge (6.2)-(6.3) is the brst charge in the minimal sector. in order to
construct gauge xed theories in the most general way we need to extend the manifold
further with lagrange multipliers and antighosts. the complete brst charge q, which
also is hermitian and nilpotent, contains  and additional terms involving the lagrange
multipliers and antighosts [14]. the gauge xing is then performed by means of an odd
operator  such that the eective gauge xed hamiltonian contains the operator [q, ]. 
seems always possible to be chosen to be nilpotent in such a way that it may be identied
with a cobrst charge [16].

6.1 equations of motion in terms of antibrackets

the equations of motion in a gauge xed theory is determined by an eective hamiltonian
operator of the form h = h + (ih)1[q, ] where h commutes with q. now any gauge
theory may be expressed in terms of an equivalent reparametrization invariant theory in
which the hamiltonian is of the form h = (ih)1[q, ] where the new q contains a term
with a new ghost multiplying the constraint variable p0 + h, where p0 is the conjugate
momentum to time, and where the new gauge xing fermion  has a corresponding new
gauge xing term. the eective equations of motion becomes then

a = (ih)1[a, h] = (ih)2[a, [q, ]] = (ih)2(a, )q  (ih)2 1
2

[q, [, a]],

(6.7)

12

where the quantum antibracket is the general one dened by (2.1). the last equality
implies

h|(cid:18)(ih)2 a  (a, )q(cid:19)|i = 0,

(6.8)

where |i, |i are physical states annihilated by q. the equation of motion (6.7) may also
be expressed entirely in terms of antibrackets if we make use of the symmetric combination
of both q- and -antibrackets. we have the relation

(ih)2 a = [a, [q, ]] =

2

3(cid:18)(a, )q + (a, q)(cid:19).

(6.9)

6.2 quantum master equation for generalized maurer-cartan equations.

in [4] we proposed a quantum master equation for generalized maurer-cartan equations of
operators in arbitrary involutions. such operators are encoded in the hermitian, nilpotent
bfv-brst charge operator, which in the minimal sector is given by  in (6.2)-(6.3).
finite group transformations on operators are determined by the lie equations

a()


a a()


a (ih)1[a(), ya()] = 0,

(6.10)

where a is a derivative with respect to the parameter a, (a) = a. (a may also be
viewed as a new set of commuting operators.) on states the corresponding lie equations
are

ha()|



da ha()|(cid:18) 

a (ih)1ya()(cid:19) = 0.

(6.11)

the operator ya in both these relations depends on a and must satisfy the integrability
conditions


b yb


a (1)ab = (ih)1[ya, yb],

ya

(6.12)

which in turn are integrable without further conditions. in order for the lie equations
(6.10) to be connected to the integration of the quantum involution encoded in , ya()
has to be of the form

ya() = b

a,(6.13)

a()b(1)a+b + {possible ghost dependent terms}, b

a(0) = b

where b
a() are operators in general. one may note that in a ghost independent scheme
the generators of the nite transformations are a. however, within our brst framework,
[, pa] = a + {ghost dependent terms}, are the appropriate generators which motivates the
form (6.13). here we take one step further and dene ya to be of the general form

ya() = (ih)1[, a()],

(a) = a + 1,

(6.14)

where ya has ghost number zero and a ghost number minus one. this form implies
that [ya(), ] = 0, so that if [a(0), ] = 0 then [a(), ] = 0, i.e. a brst invariant
operator remains brst invariant when transformed according to (6.10). equations (6.13)
and (6.14) together with (6.2) and (6.3) imply that a in (6.14) must be of the form

a() = b

a()pb + {possible ghost dependent terms},

a(0) = b
b
a.

(6.15)

13

one may note that the lie equations (6.10) also may be dened in terms antibrackets.
from (6.7) we have

a()



a (ih)2(a, )  (ih)2 1
2

[[a, ], ](1) = 0,

(6.16)

where we have introduced the general quantum antibracket dened in accordance with
(2.1). the integrability condition (6.12) for ya leads by means of (6.14) to the following
equivalent equation for a


b b


a (1)ab = (ih)2(a, b) 

a

1
2

(ih)1[ab, ],

(6.17)

which also involves the -antibracket in (6.16). due to the form (6.15) of a, eq.(6.17)
are generalized maurer-cartan equations for b
a(). the integrability conditions of (6.17)
lead to equivalent rst order equations for ab and so on. thus, ya is replaced by a whole
set of operators, and the integrability conditions (6.12) for ya are replaced by a whole set
of integrability conditions.

in [4] we proposed that all these integrability conditions are embedded in one single

quantum master equation given by

(s, s) = ih[, s],

where  is an extended nilpotent bfv-brst charge given by

   + aa(1)a, 2 = 0,

[a, b] = iha
b ,

(6.18)

(6.19)

where in turn a are conjugate momenta to a, now turned into operators, and a, (a) =
a + 1, are new ghost variables to be treated as parameters. the operator s(, ) in the
master equation (6.18) is an even operator dened by

s(, )  g + aa() +

xk=1

a2k1 a2k+1,

(6.20)

where g is the ghost charge operator in (6.6). (in [4] we made another choice for n.) the
operators a1an() in (6.20) satisfy the properties

(a1an) = a1 + . . . + an + n,

[g, a1an] = niha1an.

(6.21)

the last relation implies that a1an has ghost number minus n.
if we assign ghost
number one to a then  has ghost number one and s has ghost number zero. our main
conjecture is that the operators a1an() in (6.20) may be identied with a, ab in
(6.17) and all the s in their integrability conditions in a particular manner.

the antibracket (s, s) in (6.18) is the quantum antibracket dened by (2.1) with q

replaced by . thus, we have

(s, s)  [[s, ], s].

(6.22)

14

by means of this relation it is easily seen that the consistency of (6.18) requires [, s] to
be nilpotent. we have

[, (s, s)] = 0  [, s]2 = 0.

(6.23)

the explicit form of [s, ] is to the lowest orders in a

[s, ] = ih + a[a, ] + baa

(6.24)

to zeroth and rst order in a the master equation (6.18) is satised identically. however,
to second order in a it yields exactly (6.17). at third order in a it yields

abc(1)ac +

8 n(ih)1[ab, c](1)ac + cycle(a, b, c)o ,

(6.25)

where we have introduced the higher quantum antibracket of order 3 dened by (3.6) and
explicitly given by (3.9) with q replaced by .

comparing equation (6.25) and the integrability conditions of (6.17) we nd exact
agreement. we have also checked that the consistency condition (6.23) yields exactly
(6.12) to second order in a, which is consistent with (6.17) as it should. similarly we
have checked that (6.23) to third order in a yields a condition which is consistent with
(6.25), exactly like (6.12) is consistent with (6.17).

the master equation (6.18) yields at higher orders in a equations involving still higher
quantum -antibrackets dened by (3.6) and operators abc... with still more indices. we
conjecture that these equations agree exactly with the integrability conditions of (6.25).
for a rank-n theory we expect that there exists a solution of the form (6.20) to the master
equation (6.18), which terminates just at the maximal order n . in the appendix we treat
quasigroup rst rank theories in detail.

we end this subsection with some transformation formulas of the master equation

(6.18) [6]. let us dene the transformed operators s() and () by

s()  e

i

h f se i

h f , ()  e

i

h f e i

h f ,

(6.26)

where  is a parameter and f an arbitrary even operator. if s and  satisfy the master
equation (6.18) then s() and () satisfy the transformed master equation

if f in (6.26) is restricted to satisfy the master equation (6.18), i.e.

(s(), s())() = ih[(), s()].

then () in (6.26) reduces to

(f, f ) = ih[, f ],

() =  + (ih)1[, f ](1  e).

15

(6.27)

(6.28)

(6.29)

(notice that (6.28) implies () + () = 0.) for f = s we have in particular that s
satises the master equation (6.18) with  replaced by () in (6.29) where f is replaced
by s.

there are also transformations on s leaving  unaected for which the master equation

(6.18) is invariant. the natural automorphism of (6.18) is

s  s  exp(cid:26)(ih)2[, ](cid:27)s exp(cid:26)(ih)2[, ](cid:27),

(6.30)

where  is an arbitrary odd operator. it is easily seen that s also satises the master
equation (6.18). for innitesimal transformations we have

s = (ih)2[s, [, ]],
21s  (21  12)s = (ih)2[s, [, 21]],
21 = (ih)2(2, 1).

(6.31)

analogously to the equivalent forms of the general equations of motion in (6.7) and (6.9)
we have also

s = (ih)2(cid:18)(s, ) 
= (ih)2 2

3(cid:18)(s, ) + (s, )(cid:19).

1
2

[, [, s]](cid:19) =

(6.32)

if the transformation (6.30) connects any solutions of the master equation (6.18) then

the general solution is

s = exp(cid:26)(ih)2[, ](cid:27)g exp(cid:26)(ih)2[, ](cid:27),

(6.33)

where  depends on all variables including a and a but not on a.  is only required
to have total ghost number minus one since s has total ghost number zero. the explicit
form (6.20) of s is then reproduced. notice that s = g is a trivial solution of the master
equation (6.18).

we would also like to mention that there is a possibility to extend the formalism to
-dependent states and operators which satisfy the lie equations (6.10)-(6.11) with the
-dependent connections ya(, )  (ih)1[, a(, )] where a(, ) is determined by
the equation


a (ih)1[s, ya] = 0.

s

these -extended states, | ai, and operators, a, satisfy the equations

s| ai = ihgh(|ai)| ai,

[s, a] = ihgh(a) a,

where |ai = | ai(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

and a = a(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=0

. the details will be given elsewhere.

7 generalization to the sp(2)-case

there is an sp(2)-extended version of bv-quantization [7, 8] which in its most general form
is called triplectic quantization [9]. in this formalism there are two generalized antibrackets
which are called sp(2)-antibrackets. also these brackets may be mapped on operators.
the quantum sp(2)-antibrackets are dened by [1, 6] (a, b, c, . . . = 1, 2, are sp(2)-indices
which are raised (and lowered) by the sp(2) metric ab (ab))

(f, g)a

q 

1

2(cid:16)[f, [qa, g]]  [g, [qa, f ]](1)(f +1)(g +1)(cid:17) ,

(7.1)

where qa are two odd operators. the corresponding classical antibrackets satisfy the
properties (2.3)-(2.8) except that the jacobi identities are valid for symmetrized sp(2)-
indices. the quantum sp(2)-antibrackets (7.1) satisfy (2.3)-(2.6). however, instead of the
jacobi identities we have

(f, (g, h){a

q )b}

q (1)(f +1)(h+1) + cycle(f, g, h) =

=

1
6

(1)f +g+h(cid:26)(cid:18)[f, [g, [h, [qa, qb]]]] +

1
2

[[f, [g, [h, q{a]]], qb}](cid:19) (1)f h+

+ (cid:18)[f, [h, [g, [qa, qb]]]] +

1
2

[[f, [h, [g, q{a]]], qb}](cid:19) (1)h(f +g)(cid:27) + cycle(f, g, h),

(7.2)

and instead of leibniz rule we have

(f g, h)a

q  f (g, h)a

q  (f, h)a

qg(1)g (h+1) =

1

=

2(cid:16)[f, h][g, qa](1)h(g+1) + [f, qa][g, h](1)g(cid:17) .

the relation (2.13) generalizes e.g. to

(f, q{a)b} =

[f, [qa, qb]].

3
2

(7.3)

(7.4)

higher order quantum sp(2)-antibrackets are dened by (3.5) with q replaced by qa. the
properties (3.6)-(3.12) are then valid by the same replacement. the relations (3.13)-(3.14)
are valid with two sp(2)-indices. to obtain the generalized jacobi identities we need the
corresponding identities to (3.15). however, since they involve the trivial equalities

[eaqaea, eaqbea]  ea[qa, qb]ea = 0,

(7.5)

which are symmetric in the sp(2)-indices, the generalized jacobi identities corresponding
to (3.20) will also be symmetric in the sp(2)-indices. corresponding to the treatment
in section 4 we may also dene ordinary quantum sp(2)-antibrackets by a restriction to
a maximal set of commuting operators.
if these operators are functions of commuting
coordinate operators then qa and [qa, qb] must be maximally quadratic in the momenta
in order for the sp(2)-antibrackets to strictly satisfy the jacobi identities and leibniz
rule.

in the considered applications of the quantum sp(2)-antibrackets (7.1) to the sp(2)-
version of the bv-quantization and to the sp(2)-version of bfv-brst quantization the
two odd operators qa were required to satisfy [6]

q{aqb}  qaqb + qbqa  [qa, qb] = 0.

(7.6)

17

the appearance of two nilpotent dening operators is natural since the sp(2)-versions are
directly related to the so called brst-antibrst quantization [17]. in the sp(2)-version
of bv-quantization we have to consider commuting operators which are functions of a
maximal commuting set of coordinate operators. the operators qa are then maximally
quadratic in the momenta so that the quantum sp(2)-antibrackets are ordinary ones. in
the schrodinger representation qa are then equal to the two nilpotent dierential opera-
tors, a, exactly like q was represented by  in section 5. the quantum master equations
are here

qa|wi = 0,

a = 1, 2.

(7.7)

in [6] this formalism was shown to provide for an operator version of the sp(2)-extended
bv-quantization corresponding to the what we had in section 5 for the ordinary bv-
quantization. for instance, the master equations and the gauge xed partition function in
triplectic quantization were shown to follow from (7.7) in analogy to what we had in sec-
tion 5. the quantum master equations for generalized quantum maurer-cartan equations
for arbitrary open groups given in section 6 were also shown to be possible to formulate
in terms of the sp(2)-brackets (7.1) in [6].
