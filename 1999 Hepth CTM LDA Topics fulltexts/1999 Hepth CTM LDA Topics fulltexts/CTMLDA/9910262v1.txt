abstract

we study the thermodynamic behavior of branched polymers. we rst study random
walks in order to clarify the thermodynamic relation between the canonical ensem-
ble and the grand canonical ensemble. we then show that correlation functions for
branched polymers are given by those for 3 theory with a single mass insertion, not
those for the 3 theory themselves. in particular, the two-point function behaves as
1/p4, not as 1/p2, in the scaling region. this behavior is consistent with the fact that
the hausdor dimension of the branched polymer is four.

1 introduction

branched polymers are the simplest generalization of the random walk and have been stud-
ied extensively[1][2].
it is of great importance not only in statistical physics but also in
particle physics, in particular, for understanding the critical behavior of random surfaces
and quantum gravity[3][4][5]. our recent interest in branched polymers arose in our attempt
to formulate superstring theory nonperturbatively.
in the paper [6], we have studied the
dynamics of the type iib matrix model in such a framework ([7] and see [8] for review).
in our matrix model approach, the eigenvalues of matrices are interpreted as space-time
coordinates. in these investigations, we nd the system of branched polymers in a simple
approximation. although it is far from the at four dimensional manifold, branched poly-
mers share the same (fractal) dimensionality four with our space-time. it might be the rst
indication that superstring can explain the dimensionality of our space-time.

in this paper, we comment on a eld theoretic description of branched polymers. it is
well-known that a system of random walks is described by a free scalar eld theory if there
is no eect of self-avoidance. similarly it is widely believed that the system of branched
polymers is described by a scalar eld theory with a three-point coupling, that is, 3 scalar
eld theory. we will, however, show that it is not so by treating the universal part of the
partition function carefully. the system of branched polymers without self-avoidance can
be exactly solvable by introducing the grand canonical ensemble and using the so called
schwinger-dyson technique. in order to extract the correct large n limit (n is the system
size) or the thermodynamic limit, we have to check that the grand canonical ensemble is
dominated by the larger size system. in other words, we have to extract the universal part.
our claim is that we need a single mass insertion in each m-point correlation function
of the 3 scalar eld theory in order to describe m-point correlation functions in branched
polymers. mass insertion here means a change of a propagator in each m-point function
from an ordinary one, 1/p2, to 1/p4. in particular, the two-point function behaves as 1/p4,
not 1/p2. let us count the number of points which lie within distance r from a xed point
in d(> 4) dimensions. in the random walk, it can be estimated as r2 by using the two-point
function. we obtain r4 for branched polymers by using the 1/p4 type propagator. so our
nding are consistent with the claim that branched polymers are four dimensional fractals. a
multi-point correlation function is given by a sum of graphs of the corresponding correlation
function for 3 scalar eld theory at tree level with a single mass insertion in each graph.

our main results were announced in [10]. in this paper we would like to give a fuller
account of our results by providing more detailed derivations and explanations. the organi-
zation of this paper is the following. in section 2, we review random walks in order to clarify
the relation between the canonical and grand canonical ensemble. in section 3, we investigate
branched polymers. first we dene a canonical ensemble for a system of branched polymers
(sec. 3.1) and then introduce grand canonical ensembles (sec. 3.2). we emphasize that the
denition of a grand canonical ensemble is not unique.
in sec. 3.3, we solve schwinger-
dyson equations for the conventional grand canonical ensemble and obtain the results which
correspond to the correlation functions of a scalar 3 theory. in sec. 3.4, we consider the
thermodynamic limit of the correlation functions and obtain the correct universal behavior
of them. in section 4, we give a physical interpretation why the propagator behaves 1/p4
in branched polymers. section 5 is devoted to conclusions and discussions. we have two

1

appendices a and b which derive the partition function and the two point function in the
canonical ensemble of branched polymers.

2 random walks

in this section, we give a brief introduction to random walks in order to clarify the thermo-
dynamic relation between the canonical and grand canonical ensemble.
the canonical partition function with the system size n is given by

zn = z

yi=1

ddyi

n 1

yi=1

f (yi  yi+1) = v ( f (0))n 1

(2.1)

where v is the total volume of the system, and f (x) is a function assigned to each bond and
damps suciently fast at long distance compared to the typical length scale a0. f (p) is its
fourier transform:

f(p) = z ddx eipxf (x).

for example, we can take f (x) = exp((x/a0)2/2).

(2.9)

(2.10)

the scaling region is between the ultraviolet cuto scale a0 and the infrared scale of the
system extent, which is given by  = a0n 1/2.

the two-point correlation function is also calculated in the grand canonical ensemble. a

conventional grand canonical partition function is given as

z0 =



xn =1

n
0 zn =

v c0
c  0

(2.11)

where 0 is fugacity and c = ( f(0))1. for later convenience, we rst dene an unnormalized
two-point function by

and agrees with the result in the canonical ensemble calculation. this result gives the
correlation length  = a0n 1/2, which indicates the hausdor dimension of random walk
dh = 2.

here we give two dierent denitions of hausdor dimensions. the rst one is dened in
terms of the relation between the system size n and the extent of the system. the infrared
behavior of the above two-point function shows that the correlation damps rapidly over the
length scale  = a0n 1/2. since the extent of the system l   is proportional to n 1/2, the
hausdor dimension is given by d(1)

h = 2 where d(1)

h is denes as

l = a0n 1/d(1)
h .

(2.15)

the second denition is to use the behavior of the correlation function at much shorter
in d-dimensional coordinate space, the density

length scale than the system size l = .
correlation behaves as

g(2)(x) 

exp(m|x|)

|x|d2

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

where m = 1/. if |x|  1/m, the mass term can be neglected and g(2)(x)  1
|x|d2 . the
total number of points within a ball of radius r (r  l) around a certain point is evaluated
as

n(r) = z r

ddxg(2)(x)  (cid:18) r
a0(cid:19)

2

and gives the hausdor dimension d(2)

h = 2. here the denition of d(2)
n(r) = (cid:18) r
a0(cid:19)

d(2)

.

h

h is

the second denition of the hausdor dimension is determined only through the behavior
of correlation functions in the scaling region a0  x   and has nothing to do with
the behaviors near the infrared cuto. hence, it is a more appropriate denition than the
rst one from the thermodynamic viewpoint. of course, it is quite natural that we should
obtain the same dimension dh from the both denitions since the extent of the system is
approximately evaluated at the length l where n(l) = n.

finally in this section, we comment on generalized types of grand canonical ensembles.
since the motivation of introducing grand canonical ensembles is to reproduce the same
thermodynamic quantities as those in the canonical one, we may assign dierent weights in
summing over dierent n. we dene generalized grand canonical ensembles by

z0,l =

g(2)

0,l(p) =





xn =1
xn =1

n l n

0 zn ,

n l n
0

g(2)

n (p),

(2.19)

where 0 is fugacity. the criterion for a good grand canonical ensemble is such that we can
take the correct thermodynamic limit, or, in other words, we can correctly take the universal
part in the sum over n. that is, the correlation functions in the grand canonical ensemble

4

at the critical value of fugacity should reproduce those in the canonical ensemble for large
n:

lim
n

g(2)
n = lim

00,c

g(2)
0,l.

(2.20)

this criterion does hold if the grand canonical ensemble is dominated by large n systems.
if the above criterion is satised for some value of l, it does hold for larger values of l. in
the case of random walks, it already holds for the conventional grand canonical ensemble of
l = 0 and we do not need to introduce the generalized ensembles of l > 0.

from eqs.(2.11), (2.12), the generalized partition functions and the correlation functions

are given by

z0,



0!l
z0,l =  0
0!l
0,l(p) =  0
g(2)



g(2)
0 .

(2.21)

we are interested in the behaviors near the critical point   0 (n  ) and in the scaling
region where 1/(c  0) > 1/(c  h(p)0)  1/c. in this region, they become

z0,l

since hni = z0,l+1/z0,l = c(l + 1)/ for the generalized grand canonical ensembles of l,
the normalized correlation functions become

which agrees with the previous result (2.14) of l = 0.

3 branched polymer dynamics

3.1 canonical ensemble

branched polymers are a statistical system of n points connected by n  1 bonds whose
lengths are of order a0. the canonical partition function is dened as

zn =

1

n! xg:tree graphz

n

yi=1

ddyi y(ij):bonf of g

f (yi  yj),

(3.1)

where f (x) is a function assigned to each bond in each graph, and it damps suciently fast
at long distances compared to the typical length scale a0. the presence of the factor 1/n!
is due to the fact that the n points are regarded identical.

5

we can calculate a partition function for each n, by counting the number of all possible

tree graphs:

f (0)v,

3 f (0)2v,

16 f (0)3v,

z2 =

z1 = v,
1
2!
1
3!
1
4!

z3 =

z4 =
...
zn =

1
n!
where f (p) is a fourier transform of f (x);

n n 2 f (0)n 1v,

f(p) = z ddx eipxf (x),

(3.2)

(3.3)

and v is the total volume of the system. a derivation of the general form (3.2) is given in
the appendix a.

we dene an (unnormalized) m-point correlation function of density operators as

g(m)
n (x1,   , xm)

= zn < (x1)    (xm) >n
=

n! xg:tree graphz

yi=1

1

n

ddyi y(ij):bond of g

f (yi  yj) (x1)    (xm),

(3.4)

where the density operator is dened by

(x) =

n

xi=1

(d)(x  yi).

(3.5)

due to the translational invariance, one point function is proportional to the partition func-
tion;

g(1)

n =

n
v

zn .

(3.6)

the one-point function is nothing but the partition function with one marked point.

3.2 grand canonical ensemble

we then dene partition functions and m-point correlation functions in the generalized grand
canonical ensembles as in section 2:

z0,l =

g(m)
0,l(x1,   , xm) =





xn =1
xn =1

6

n l n

0 zn ,

n l n

0 g(m)

n (x1,   , xm).

(3.7)

(3.8)

0 is the fugacity.

the criterion for a good grand canonical ensemble is such that we can take the correct
thermodynamic limit in the following sense. the correlation functions in the grand canonical
ensemble at the critical value of fugacity should reproduce those in the canonical ensemble
for large n:

(3.9)

(3.10)

lim
n

g(m)
n = lim

00,c

g(m)
0,l,

where we have dened normalized correlation functions as

g(m)
n =

g(m)
n
zn

, g(m)

0,l =

g(m)
0,l
z0,l

.

in the case of random walks, we have conrmed that it does hold for any nonnegative value
of l but we need to check it in the case of branched polymers. to satisfy this criterion,
the grand canonical ensembles with n-dependent weights should be dominated by large n
systems. this is not assured only by taking the fugacity near the critical value. this is
because, if g(m)
n behaves as (0,c)n n  for large n and l +  < 1, the summation over
n is dominated by small n system, not by the large n  c/ even near the critical
point. on the other hand, if we take a suciently large l, we can obtain the correct large n
correlation functions in the grand canonical ensembles, which are, of course, independent of
l.

we illustrate the above mentioned criterion by taking the partition function as an exam-

ple. since the canonical ensemble partition function (3.2) behaves at large n as

zn 

n 5/2
2en

f (0)n 1v,

(3.11)

the grand canonical ensemble is approximated by

z0,l 



where

v

0

n l5/2 (/c)n

dn n l5/2 en /c,

(3.12)

 = f (0)0,
c = e1,
 = c  .

(3.13)

if we take l suciently large, the integrand in eq. (3.12) has a peak at n  c/ and we
can make n large by letting  approach c. on the other hand, if l is not suciently large, a
non-universal small n behavior dominates the summation and we cannot obtain the correct
answer of the large n limit by a grand canonical ensemble.

7

3.3 schwinger-dyson eq.

in this subsection, we recapitulate the arguments that the correlation functions for branched
polymers in the conventional grand canonical ensemble are given by massless 3 theory.
lets consider the following correlation functions g(m)
0,l=0, which are suitable for
schwinger-dyson analysis:

0 = g(m)

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

g(m)
0 (x1,   , xm) =



xn =1

0 g(m)
n

n (x1,   , xm)

we write a fourier transform of g(m)

0 (x1,   , xm) as g(m)

0 (p1,   , pm1):

0 (p1,   , pm1)

0 (x1,   , xm).

follows.

(3.21)

next, we consider the 2-point function g(2)

0 (p). when we pick up any two points on a
tree graph, we can x the path connecting these two points. thus, as can be seen from gure
3, 2-point function is calculated to be

(3.23)

here c is a positive constant of order one. recall that f (x) damps rapidly out of the region
0 < x < a0.

near the critical point, b  bc = 1, the 2-point correlation function behaves as

g(2)

0 (p) =

f (0)

h(p) + bh(p)

h(p) + n 1/2 .

0 is made out of 1-point function g(1)

0 , which is written by a

here we used eq. (3.19). thus, the correlation length is  = a0n 1/4, which shows the rst
denition of the hausdor dimension dened in (2.15) to be d(1)
h = 4. let us consider the
following region:

or in momentum space

a0  x <  = a0n 1/4

1


= n 1/4/a0 < p  1/a0.

(3.25)

(3.26)

a0 gives an ultraviolet cut-o whereas  gives an infrared cut-o length over which correlation
functions damp rapidly. in the above scaling region of (3.26), the correlation function behaves
as an ordinary massless eld g(2)
0 (p)  1/p2 and gives the second denition of the hausdor
dimension of (2.18), d(2)
h determined
from the relation of the system size n and the extent of the system. in the next section, we
show that the above behavior of the correlation function in the scaling region is not correct
and hence gives the incorrect hausdor dimension d(2)
h .

h = 2. this is dierent from the hausdor dimension d(1)

finally, we consider m > 2 point correlation functions. as in the case of the two-point
function, when m points are xed on each tree graph, we can uniquely x the path connecting
these points. therefore, an m-point function g(m)
is represented as a summation over all
0
tree diagrams with m xed points in which g(2)

g(3)

0 (p, q) = ( g(1)

0 )2 g(2)

0 (p) appear as propagators. for example,
0 (p) g(2)

0 (q) g(2)

0 (p + q).

(3.27)

in general, we obtain the following result for m-point correlation functions;

g(m)
0  correlation functions of massless 3 theory at tree level.

(3.28)

in the next subsection, we consider generalized grand canonical ensembles with larger l and
we point out that the results (3.28) do not correspond to the correct thermodynamic limit.

3.4 correlation functions in thermodynamic limit

let us consider the generalized m-point correlation functions with l  1. from the denition
(3.8), they can be obtained by applying l-th derivative to the l = 0 case:

g(m)
0,l(p1,   , pm1) = (0

here we have used hni = z0,l+1/z0,l = (2l 3)/(1 b)2 for the generalized grand canonical
ensembles of l. their p-dependences are all the same except l = 0 case. the l = 0 case, which
can be obtained directly from the schwinger-dyson equation, does not reproduce the correct
thermodynamic result.
instead, we should consider a good grand canonical correlation
function with l  1, otherwise a non-universal small n behavior aects the summation
and we cannot obtain the universal result.
in the appendix b, we estimate the large n
asymptotic behavior of the two-point function by the saddle point method. such an explicit
analytical result is completely consistent with the analysis here.

the behavior of g(2)

0,l1(p)  1/p4 gives (the second denition of ) the hausdor dimension
h = 4, which is now consistent with (the rst denition of) the hausdor dimension

(2.18) d(2)

discussed in the previous subsection. an argument expected from the gure 3 is that the
eect of branching could be absorbed by renormalizing the mass. if so, the propagator would
behave as that of random walks with a renormalized mass and we might obtain the identical
result with the l = 0 case. we discuss in the next section why this argument is not correct.

similarly, 3-point functions become

g(3)
0,l=0(p, q)  g(p)g(q)g(p + q),
g(3)
0,l1(p, q)  g(p)g(q)g(p + q) + g(p)g(q)g(p + q) + g(p)g(q)g(p + q),

(3.36)

where

g(p) =

g(p) =

1
1  bh(p) 
p2 ,
(1  bh(p))2 

1

1
p4 .

(3.37)

the behaviors do not change above l = 1. only one propagator in a graph is replaced by
g(p). this is because the derivative 
b dominantly act on the factor 1/(1  b) rather than
on 1/(1  bh(p)), as in the case of 2-point functions. here again, we might be tempted to
argue that the only eect of branching is mass renormalization and to give rise to a three
point vertex. if so, we might conclude that the 3-point function behaves as the result of
l = 0 case. as we discuss in detail in the next section, this argument is not correct in the
thermodynamic limit and we should only retain l  1 cases. hence correlation functions
for branched polymers are expressed in terms of 3 theory at tree level with a single mass
insertion.

for m-point functions (m > 3), we can obtain the same result.

g(m)
0,l=0  correlation functions for 3 theory at tree level
g(m)
0,l1  correlation functions for 3 theory at tree level with a mass insertion.

(3.38)

the universal correlation functions with l  1 represent the correct correlation functions in
the thermodynamic limit.
as a consistency check, the following relation between an (m+1)-point function and an

m-point function must hold:

g(m+1)
0,l1(p1,   , pm1, pm = 0) = n g(m)

0,l1(p1,   , pm1).

(3.39)

it actually holds because in the l.h.s. of eq. (3.39), the special class of diagrams dominate
in which the m-th end point is attached to a propagator g(p). it is due to the inequality
g(p = 0)g(p)  g(p)g(p = 0). therefore, it is equal to the r.h.s. of eq. (3.39).

4 physical interpretation by a single mother universe

in this section, we give a physical interpretation why the propagator behaves as 1/p4 instead
of 1/p2. as we can see from the gure 3, the eect of branching seems to be absorbed by

12

renormalizing the mass and we might conclude that the two-point function behaves as that
of random walks. if this is the case, the propagator should be given by an ordinary massive
scalar particle with a renormalized mass (a0n 1/4)1, instead of (a0n 1/2)1. similarly, higher
point correlation functions should be given by tree graphs of 3 eld theory. as we saw in
the previous section, these are not the correct behaviors of correlations. in this section, we
give a physical interpretation why the propagator behaves as 1/p4 instead of a conventional
behavior 1/p2 and why the higher point correlation functions behave as 3 theory with a
single mass insertion.

let us consider the two-point function as an example. two-point function g(2)

=0(p) was

dened by a sum of two-point functions in the canonical ensemble (eq.(3.14)):

g(2)

0 (p) =



xn =1

n
0

g(2)

n (p).

(4.1)

on the other hand, from the equation (3.22), it is written as a sum of all contributions over
s where s is the length between the two points in concern. each term g(1)
0 represents a
gray blob in gure 3. when we x the total number of the system n, the n points are
distributed among (s + 1) blobs. we will show here that the most dominant contributions to
the correlation functions are those that most of n points are concentrated on only a single
blob. we call this blob the mother universe. in the branched polymer, there is only one
mother universe and the other universes (blobs) contain much fewer points than the mother
universe.

to show this, we rst note that the 1-point function (blob) is expanded as

where un is given at large n as

g(1)

0 =

n
0 un



xn=1

un = g(1)

n 

n3/2 f (0)n1en

2

.

(4.2)

(4.3)

by using this expansion and eq.(3.22), we obtain the two-point function for xed n as

g(2)

n (p) =



xs=0



f (p)s
xn0=1  




xns=1

un0    unsn,n0+ns
 .

(4.4)

each contribution in the bracket comes from a graph in which the rst blob contains n0
points, the second n1 points, and so on. using (4.3), the term in the bracket becomes

2!s+1
  1

f (0)n s1en





xn0=1  

xns=1

n3/2
0

n3/2
1

   n3/2

s

n,n0+ns.

(4.5)

in the case of s = 1, the summation

n 1

xn=1

n3/2(n  n)3/2.

13

(4.6)

is dominated by terms of n  0 and n  n. for the general case with the exponent ,

n 1

xn=1

n(n  n),

(4.7)

the sum is dominated at the boundaries for  < 1 and asymmetry arises between two
blobs. on the contrary, for  > 1, n points are distributed equally and neither blob is
special. this argument can be generalized to s > 1. to conclude, most of n points belong to
a single blob along the propagator. we then have to divide the propagator with length s at
the mother universe. since the other blobs contain only a nite number of points, the eect
of branching other than dividing the propagator into two pieces is simply to renormalize the
mass of propagator. hence, the propagator behaves as a product of two ordinary ones with
a renormalized mass;

.

(4.8)

n (p)   
g(2)

p2 + m2!2

we can also apply a similar argument for the higher-point functions.

if the eect of
branching is only to renormalize the mass term, the higher-point correlation functions will be
represented by diagrams of 3 theory with propagators 1/(p2 + m2), which is not the correct
thermodynamic behavior of the correlation functions as we saw in the previous section.
similar to the case of 2-point functions above, we can argue that there is only one mother
universe in which most of the n points reside. since only a single blob contains an innitely
many points, we have to divide one of the propagators at the mother universe and this
propagator behaves as 1/(p2 +m2)2. this mother universe corresponds to the mass insertion.
the other blobs contain a nite number of points and the eect of branching can be absorbed
into mass renormalization. this is the physical reason why the higher point correlation
functions are represented by tree diagrams of 3 eld theory with a single mass insertion.

the above statement that there is only one mother universe in the branched polymer is
explained dierently as follows. let us consider again the original branched polymer systems
with n points and n  1 bonds. by counting the number of ways in which we can divide a
branched polymer into two parts by cutting a bond, we obtain a relation

(n  1)zn /v = f(0)

n 1

xn =1

[n zn /v ]

[(n  n )z(n n )/v ].

(4.9)

the factor (n  1) in the l.h.s. is interpreted as the number of bonds we can cut to divide
the whole into two parts. the factors n  and (n  n ) in the r.h.s. are interpreted as the
number of points to which the bond connecting the two parts is attached. since zn behaves
as in eq.(3.11) at large n,

nzn /v  f (0)

n (1)

xn =n 

[n zn /v ]

[(n  n )z(n n )/v ],

(4.10)

which means the summation in the r.h.s. of eq.(4.9) is dominated by terms of n   0 or
n   n. this formula can be interpreted as follows. if we divide any graph into two parts
by cutting some bond, we nd only nite points in one of them and most of them belong

14

to the other. the mother universe belongs to the larger part. consider the 2-point function
as an example. by dividing the graph of gure 3 into two parts at some bond, we nd that
most points are dominantly distributed on only one of them.

we can apply the same procedure to the dominant part with innite points. after
repeating it several times to divide the total graph into several pieces, we nd that only a
single part consists of innitely many points and the others consist of nite points. we can
nd out which blob in gure 3 is the mother universe when, after the several repetitions, the
dominant part with innite points is detached from the path in gure 3. we can also apply
the same argument to the higher-point functions. here we point out the dierence of the
argument given here and that for random surfaces[9]. although a similar inequality appears
for random surfaces, the factor n is absent on the l.h.s. of the inequality (4.10) in that
case.

5 conclusion and discussion

in this paper we have shown that the correlation functions for branched polymers are given
by those for 3 theory at tree level with a single mass insertion if we correctly take the
thermodynamic limit. it is not given by those for 3 theory at tree level themselves. we have
interpreted the single mass insertion as the presence of a single mother universe in branched
polymers.

we have reviewed random walks in order to clarify the relation between the canonical
and grand canonical ensemble. we have introduced generalized grand canonical ensembles
which assign dierent weights for dierent system sizes. we have emphasized that a good
grand canonical ensemble is such that the ensemble average should be dominated by the
systems of large size. in branched polymers, this criterion is not satised in the conventional
grand canonical ensemble. nevertheless we can consider good grand canonical ensembles
in branched polymers. our conclusion follows as the universal prediction of good grand
canonical ensembles. it represents the correct scaling behavior of the correlation functions
in canonical ensembles of large system size n.

appendix a

in this appendix, we derive the canonical ensemble partition function (3.2) from the schwinger-

(a.4)

in this appendix, we derive the two-point correlation function in the canonical ensemble for

(b.1)

this integration can be estimated for large n by the saddle point approximation. since
bn ebn = en (blog b), the saddle point is at b = 1. the steepest descent direction is along the
imaginary direction. we change the variable from b to t around the saddle point as

b  log b = 1

the new parameter t is written in terms of b by

solving this, we obtain

t = i(1  b)(1 +

the correlation function for branched polymers behaves very dierently from the case of

this result for canonical ensemble is completely consistent with the result of the grand
