1. introduction.

strings and point particles are intimately connected. the most direct relation
appears in the infrared limit, where the string tension t blows up and only
the massless string modes (i.e. particles) survive with their characteristic dy-
namics: gauge theory and gravity, with or without supersymmetry, emerge at
leading order in 1/t as their eective spacetime description.

the ve 10d superstring theories, together with 11d supergravity, are con-
nected within the framework of m theory. yet, besides the (inconsistent)
bosonic string, there exists still another kind of string theory, namely those
possessing two worldsheet supersymmetries and being critical in 2+2 dimen-
sions. the understanding of these so-called n=2 strings and their spacetime
dynamics was critically enhanced by the work of ooguri and vafa [1]. they
discovered that the single massless scalar mode present in such strings again
encodes yang-mills or gravity, but with a self-duality restriction rather than a
supersymmetric extension!

over the last ten years, further progress has been made in these matters,
leading to fascinating interrelations between the mathematical structures and
the physical aspects of this strange kind of strings.

2. n=2 strings  quantization.

from the worldsheet point of view, critical n=2 strings in at kleinian space
r2,2 are a theory of n=2 supergravity (h, , a) on a 1+1 dimensional riemann
surface (with punctures and possibly boundaries), coupled to two chiral n=2
massless matter multiplets (x, ). the latters components are complex scalars
(the four string coordinates) and so(1, 1) dirac spinors (their four nsr part-
ners). the brink-schwarz worldsheet action [2] enjoys n=2 super coordinate
and weyl invariance on the worldsheet, as well as global u(1, 1) target space-
time symmetry. hence, as a gauge theory, it represents a constraint system.
as is well known, those constraints are in fact needed to get rid of the negative
norm fock states inevitable in any relativistic theory with spin one and higher.
physical states are required to obey (constraints)|physi = 0, and exactly for
d=2+2 this condition forecloses negative norm states and decouples all zero
norm states, yielding hphys|physi  0.
the most appropriate technique to covariantly quantize gauge theories makes
use of the cohomology of the brst operator q, which acts on a ghost-extended
fock space of string states. in this way, one nds that the spectrum of phys-
ical states is completely devoid of the excited (massive) states which are the
hallmark of strings. merely a single massless scalar state |ki at the lowest

1

+  h 2

 with h 2

mass level, k2=0 (no tachyons either), appears, which in the open string case
is dressed with chan-paton labels: |k, ai. in particular, there is no room for
spacetime fermions or supersymmetry. thus, n=2 strings seem to be identical
to their eective spacetime eld theories, which contain a u(1, 1) scalar eld,
named (x) in the closed-string case and (x) (lie algebra valued) in the
open-string case [1].
naively, one would expect a string theory in r2,2 to possess global so(2, 2)
lorentz symmetry. however, the necessity to introduce a complex structure
(r2,2  c1,1) reduces the invariance,
spin(2, 2) = su(1, 1)  su(1, 1)  u(1)  su(1, 1)  u(1, 1)
, (1)
making it natural to use a complex index notation, (x) = (xa, xa) with a 
{1, 2}. the moduli space of complex structures is the two-sheeted hyperboloid
h 2 = h 2
  su(1, 1)/u(1). it can be completed to cp 1 by
sewing the two sheets together along a circle, cp 1 = h 2
interestingly, the angle  of this s1 can be interpreted as the maxwell in-
stanton angle appearing as one of two string coupling constants. more pre-
cisely, the perturbative expansion in worldsheet topologies gives string cong-
urations with u(1) (maxwell) bundles of chern number (instanton number)
m := 1
2  f (with f =da locally) a weight factor of eim . in addition, the an-
gle  characterizes a real polarization or cotangent structure, t r2,2  r2 r2,
.
which denes a pair of null planes. in this context, it proves convenient to em-
ploy a real sl(2, r) spinor index notation, (x) = (x
) with   {+,}, and
.
 = vw.
. the spinor v,
each null vector factorizes into two real spinors, u
which (modulo scale) determines the null planes, now happens to encode not
only the instanton angle  in its phase but also the other (open) string cou-
pling g  r+, weighing the euler number of the worldsheet, in its modulus [3]:

2(cid:19) .

therefore, the space of string couplings is that of nonzero real sl(2, r) spinors,
and xing their values amounts to breaking the global lorentz invariance of
r2,2 in a way dierent from (1),

spin(2, 2) = sl(2, r)  sl(2, r)  r  sl(2, r)

,

where r here stands for the stability group of the spinor v,

in place of the euler number i shall use the spin variable

j = 2nc + no 4 + 4(#handles) + 2(#boundaries) + 2(#crosscaps)  z (5)
for worldsheets of a given topology, with nc closed and no open string legs.
while the open string coupling g as a gauge coupling is dimensionless in 2+2
dimensions, the closed string coupling , being a gravitational coupling, carries
dimension [] = cm. their relation is  = g2/t where t is the string
tension. since i argue that the string couplings (g, ei) can be changed at will
by global so(2, 2) transformations not preserving v, it is admissible to rotate
them to (g, ei)=(1, 1) by a convenient choice of lorentz frame, and i will do
so for most of this talk. in this fashion, only the highest weights of sl(2, r)
representations occur.

3. n=2 strings  interactions.

so far, i have extracted from n=2 string theory a scalar eld ( or )
with a massless dispersion. to nd its dynamics, one must compute its self-
interaction, which is determined perturbatively by the string scattering ampli-
tudes. the rst-quantized string path integral for the (nc, no)-point function
a(nc,no) includes a sum over worldsheet topologies (j, m), weighted with ap-
propriate powers in the string couplings (g, ei):

a(nc,no)(g, ) = xj 2nc+no4

gj

+jxm =j(cid:0) 2j

j+m(cid:1) sinj m 

2 cosj+m 

2 a(nc,no)

j,m

(6)

where the instanton sum has a nite range because bundles with |m|>j do not
contribute. all length dimensions (i.e. powers of t ) have been absorbed into
the partial amplitudes a(nc,no)
j,m , which are integrals over the metric, gravitini,
and maxwell moduli spaces. the integrands may be obtained as correlation
functions of vertex operators in the n=(2, 2) superconformal eld theory on
the worldsheet surface of xed shape (moduli) and topology.

in momentum space and for the frame (g, )=(1, 0),

with n := nc+no, and a(nc,no)
should be identied as the contribution of a
class of feynman diagrams (belonging to spin j) to the amputated scalar eld
n-point function (in this frame). a tree has j < 2nc+no, and one loop means

legs carry chan-paton labels a, b, . . ., which appear in the killing form kab
and the structure constants f abc of the gauge group. beyond n=3, mixed
open/closed tree amplitudes are expected to vanish as well, a fact that has so
far been shown only for hcccoi and hcoooi [5].

since  is lie-algebra valued, a trace is understood where it appears. appar-
ently, four fundamental cubic vertices occur. those and the massless propaga-
tors must be used in feynman diagrams to evaluate higher n-point functions.
the mismatch of the eld theory result with the corresponding string ampli-
tude is then cured by adding higher fundamental vertices to the spacetime
action. the latter will make new contributions to even higher n-point func-
tions, so that an iterative process is started. for the case at hand, however, it
turns out that beyond n=3 all tree-level n-point functions based on the four
cubic vertices just vanish! non-trivial kinematical identities in 2+2 dimen-
sions ensure that the dierent scattering channels conspire and combine to
zero. hence, no further vertices need to be added to the spacetime action in
order to reproduce the complete tree-level string scattering.

if one chooses to have the couplings in front of the interaction terms, a com-
parison of lint with the kinetic terms tr 1
2(cid:3) reveals that the
scalars carry non-canonical length dimensions [] = cm0 and [] = cm1 which
necessitates dimensionful constants (t and t 2) in front of the action. in total,
the (tree-level) spacetime lagrangian reads [4]

2(cid:3) and  1

and displays a dimensional hierarchy: to leading order (t 2) in the string
tension, there is only the basic closed-string vertex; to order t the open-string
sector joins; and to order t 2  t 0 the unusual eight-derivative vertex comes
in. in the t limit of the n=2 string, the o(t ) and o(1) terms are seen as
stringy corrections to the  dynamics. freezing the  dynamics, however,
open strings () in the  background are dominant. in view of the absence of
massive string excitations, it is quite peculiar to observe a dependence on the
string tension for the eective eld theory. obviously, one must distinguish
between the full spacetime eld theory and its eld theory limit.

5

since  d4xl4 is a tree-level eective action, its non-renormalizability need
not concern us. one can, however, improve on this drawback by using as
alternative lagrangian [6]

l

4 = trne(cid:3) + g
+ ne(cid:3) + 

2 e [d, d] + e dd  ddo
2 e dd  dd +  

2 e dddd  ddddo (11)
where lagrange multiplier elds e and e with [e] = cm2 and [e] = cm3

have been introduced to absorb the dimensionful constants. based on the
phenomenon of ghost pictures in string theory, there is a certain rationale
for enlarging the number of elds (even to innity), although such elds do

respectively. the lagrangian (11) yields the same equations of motion (plus
two more) as the original one (10). yet, it is not only renormalizable but even

not represent new degrees of freedom. alternatively in eld theory, e and
e may be interpreted as the other helicity state of the gluon and graviton,
one-loop exact since powers of  go with inverse powers ofe or e. nevertheless,

the o-shell structure of these actions is incomplete unless a comparison with
string amplitudes is made at the loop level.

the tree-level string amplitudes only tell us the eld equations of motion,

(15)

the - coupling has disappeared from the  equation as a string correction,
so that this set of equations is not lagrangian. hence, an action principle for
the spacetime dynamics requires the string extension of eqs. (14) and (15).

5. self-duality interpretation.
the equations of motion (14) and (15) are known to mathematicians and in-
tegrable systems experts as the curved leznov equation [7] and the second
plebanski equation [8], respectively. they describe self-dual yang-mills cou-
pled to self-dual gravity in 2+2 dimensional spacetime, in a particular gauge.
let me demonstrate this connection, rst in the at limit 0.

6

any two-form eld strength f = da + aa decomposes into its self-dual and
anti-self-dual part, f = f(0,1) + f(1,0). the vanishing of f(1,0) is equivalent to
the three component equations

full agreement with the string eective eld theory has been reached for t.
what about the stringy corrections in (13) to plebanskis second equa-
tion (15)? do they have a covariant interpretation in the self-dual framework?
indeed, it is not hard to see that the last two terms in (13) are proportional to

1

t  f  f

and

  r  r or   c  c ,

(29)

respectively. yet, since two derivatives are needed to move from plebanskis to
the self-duality equation, the modication of the latter should schematically
look like

r(1,0)   dd (a f  f + b r  r)

(30)

but i dont know how to write out these derivatives. let me close this part
by remarking that other formulations of self-dual yang-mills plus gravity can
be reached from n=2 strings. had i chosen to average over the cotangent
structures () in (6) rather than taken =0, scalar eld dynamics governed
by yangs [9] and plebanskis rst equation [8] would have emerged. these
equations again describe self-dual yang-mills and self-dual gravity, albeit in a
dierent gauge.

8

6. innite symmetry from pictures.

self-dual eld theories are integrable. it is therefore natural to search for a
corresponding integrable structure in n=2 strings. let me concentrate briey
on the closed-string sector, i.e. self-dual gravity as parametrized by plebanskis
second equation.

it is known that self-dual gravity possesses an innity class of non-local sym-
metries, which form a subgroup of the loop group

lsdi c(m) = c (s1, sdi c(m))

(31)

of area-preserving dieomorphisms of the spacetime manifold m. they may be
used to generate new solutions of plebanskis equation from old ones. general
symmetries  of eq. (15) satisfy

 (cid:3)  +  dd  dd  = 0

(32)

and correspond to shifts in the moduli parametrizing the solution space.

an innite hierarchy of commuting symmetry ows is generated by the max-
imal abelian subalgebra c2  c[] of (31), with generators {n
a}. it is used
to parametrize the solution space to plebanskis equation by coordinates t =
a xa). starting from the obvious
n) = (ta
(ta
symmetry under spacetime translation, one can recursively solve the equations
of the hierarchy and recover the dependence on the moduli. these non-local
abelian symmetries are best described in momentum space, where their lin-
earization takes the form [10]

1, ...), where (ta

0) = (xa, a

n(k) = ka h(k)n (k)

,

n = 0, 1, 2, . . .

,

a = 1, 2 ,

(33)

with kk = 0 and the momentum phase

h(k) = k1/k2 = k2/k1 = (h(k)1)

.

(34)

it is possible to recover such symmetries from rst-quantized string theory.
however, in our single-string fock space symmetries can only act linearly,

 |physi = |i + a|physi

.

(35)

to search for global symmetries which are unbroken (|i=0) in the given back-
ground, the proper tool is the cohomology of the brst operator. more pre-
cisely, all conserved charges reside in the brst cohomology at k = 0 and at

9

ghost number gh = ghphys1. this task has been solved [10, 11] for the closed
n=2 string, with the nding of an innity of commuting symmetry charges
a, constructed from the so-called ground ring. these charges are labeled by
m  {j, . . . , j}
(36)

2, . . .} , m  {j, . . . , j} ,

2, 1, 3

a  {1, 2} ,
and act on physical states as follows,

j, j  {0, 1

j,m;j, m |phys, ki = ka h(k)(jm)(j m) |phys, ki
aa

(37)

where |phys, ki represents the same physical state as |phys, ki. comparison
with (33) yields an obvious match! moreover, it is quite satisfying to realize [10]
that the ward identites based on these symmetries are strong enough to enforce

ki  kj + ki  kj = 0

 i, j

(38)

for non-zero tree amplitudes. this condition kills all trees beyond the three-
point function, in accordance with the explicit computations.

here, i would like to digress briey to explain the picture phenomenon [12]
as the origin of the newfound string symmetries. in the brst framework for
local worldsheet supersymmetry, one introduces rst-order commuting ghosts
 and anti-ghosts , whose fourier modes obey

[r , s] = r+s,0

for

r, s  z+ 1

2

in the ramond sector

.

(39)

the separation of the ghost and anti-ghost modes into creation and anni-
hilation operators denes a ghost vacuum. there is a freedom of choice,
parametrized by an integer , in

r|i = 0 for

r  1

2

and

r|i = 0 for

r  1

2+ .

(40)

due to the commuting nature of the (, ) ghosts, dierent vacua |i (and the
fock spaces built over them) are formally connected only through the action
of distributions like (r) in ghost/antighost modes or by extending the fock
space via bosonization [12, 13]. for example, one may check that

|1i = ( 1

2

)|0i

and

|0i = ( 1

2

)|1i

.

(41)

hence, dierent pictures are isomorphic but not identical. at this stage, one
may wonder if this picture degeneracy is relevant at all. why not just choose
one of these pictures for good, say the one with the canonical value =  1?

10

it was recently discovered [11], however, that the brst cohomology for k=0
depends on the picture number! 1 therefore, ghost pictures, being conjugate
to the higher time coordinates in the moduli space of self-dual metrics, have
a physical signicance.

7. beyond tree level.

in the absence of a lorentz covariant action, there is no obvious recipe how
to covariantly quantize 2+2 dimensional self-dual eld theories. of course,
one may naively take plebanskis, leznovs, yangs or other actions o-shell,
but the result is expected to depend on the chosen gauge. yet, at one loop
there seems to be agreement [6]. more explicitly for self-dual yang-mills, the

(43)

the fact that this amplitude has only two-particle poles and no cuts in the
complex momentum plane is remarkable but consistent with the vanishing of
the tree-level graphs. it is also infrared nite (the n=3 result is not). fur-
thermore, after wick rotating from 2+2 to 3+1 dimensions, (43) is also the
leading-color qcd result for this so-called maximally helicity violating con-
guration (i.e. a legs only)! this has led to the conjecture that all such
(mhv) amplitudes in qcd are (to leading color) given by the self-dual sector
alone. at tree-level, such a statement is empty since the only non-vanishing
amplitudes (n=3) cannot be continued to minkowski space. the obvious kine-
matical dierence is that the presence of null planes in r2,2 allows a massless
particle to decay into two, which in r3,1 is possible only in the collinear limit.

n=2 strings should provide a natural o-shell extension of (gauge-xed) self-
dual eld theories, since critical string theories are per construction quantum
consistent. as i have demonstrated, n=2 strings classically agree (at t)
with those gauge-xed eld theories. however, this does not mean that they

produce the same loop amplitudes. like for higher tree-level n-point func-
tions, one must compare the one-loop diagrams from the cubic action (10)
or (11) with the corresponding one-loop string amplitude and interpret the
dierence, if any, as a further correction to the (classical) eective spacetime
action. this is the reason for the one loop entries in my table of amplitudes.
unfortunately, only three-string scattering has been evaluated at one loop and
found to be infrared divergent [16], just like the one-loop three-point functions
for leznovs or plebanskis second prepotential. clearly, the crucial test is
the computation of an n=2 string one-loop four-point amplitude, which may
(after wick rotation) be compared directly with (43). this rather technical
task is under way, with indications that the result may be infrared nite. if
agreement between self-dual eld theories and n=2 strings is found also at
the quantum level, the latter can be employed to calculate entirely left-handed
multi-gluon scattering in qcd (and analogous multi-graviton scattering in
four dimensions).

the frontier should be pushed back in two (related) directions. first, we need
more explicit string loop results, perhaps with the help of ward identities
associated to the innite set of symmetries. second, more general spacetime
(plus gauge eld) backgrounds ought to be investigated. more concretely,
compactications, the spectrum and charges of d-branes, possible dualities,
and constant antisymmetric tensor backgrounds are waiting to be worked out.
