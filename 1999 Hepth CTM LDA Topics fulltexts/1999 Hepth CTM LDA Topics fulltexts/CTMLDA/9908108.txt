(2) question immediately arises whether b eld interpreted sort connection. point investigated teitelboim et al , found one could regard 2-form parallel transport loops (e.g. closed strings), provided transformation abelian, (1). nonabelian b look elsewhere. freedman townsend  proposed lagrangian nonabelian b. cast rst-order formulation non-linear model, elds appear dual lagrange multiplier giving connecton con- straint, thus l = tr aa + tr bf , (3) b = 1 2 b (hodge) dual b, tr denotes trace nonabelian indices. action invariant trans- formation b = d, (4) = iga covariant derivative respect a, transform. similar lagrangian appears loop space formulation yangmills theory nonlinear model : l = tr aa + tr bf , (5) 1 logarithmic derivative holonomy gauge poten- tial a, f covariant curl a. exact analogy freedmantownsend lagrangian (3). although loop variables thought connection, yangmills gauge transformation (which transforms potential usual way), invariant. moreover, invariance l gauge transformation demands b eld transforms b = d, (6) = iga loop covariant derivative corresponding a. exactly freedmantownsend transformation (4). time, conrms result  nonabelian b behave like connection, even loop space. paper shall present geometric framework b(x) eld regarded gauge potential cohomological freedom intimately related existence connection a. go explore mathematical consequences construction may useful physical applications. 2 flat connections twisted de rham complex ease presentation, section shall use almost exclusively index-free notation dierential forms. connection mean one zero curvature. means shall include general case base space x (e.g. spacetime) need simply connected, case connection may non- trivial holonomy. fact, well known gauge equivalent classes connections 11 correspondence conjugacy classes irreducible representations 1(x) gauge group g . denote exterior covariant derivative curvature con- nection da fa respectively, form d2 = da(da) = da(d + ) 2 = d(d + ) + (d + ) = (da + a) = fa . (7) hence at, d2 = 0. means exterior covariant derivative actually used dierential dierential complex, direct contrast general yangmills case. recall associated principal g bundle x, con- nection a, vector bundle e (with bre lie algebra g). consider space p(x, e) p-forms values e, denition space global sections vector bundle (pt x) e, tensor product p-th exterior power cotangent bundle x vector bundle e. locally open set u x p-form given = x ei, (8) p-forms u ei sections e u, tensor product algebra c functions u. case vector bundle e, extend usual de rham complex (x, d) x complex (x, e, da) using connection a. atness guaran- tees existence locally constant sections e1 u (n=rank e) daei u = 0. dene exterior derivative da form u , . . . , dn da(x e ei u ) = x(di) ei u (9) open set u. since sections ei u locally constant, read- ily seen da agrees overlaps hence globally dened . moreover, d2 = 0. therefore makes sense dene cohomology groups h a(x, e) da-closed forms modulo da-exact forms usual way. easy see e trivial bundle rank n trivial connec- tion, h trivial(x, e) n copies usual de rham groups h (x) (see  p.83 proposition 7.4). generally recognized cohomology group elements correspond physically interesting quantities . think b eld 2-from representative element h 2, transformation nothing cohomological freedom exact 2-form: b = da 3 (10) 1-form, words, transformation (4). therefore gauge freedom usual yangmills type. moreover, (10) reduces (1) abelian case, need therefore interpreted gauge (in electromagnetism sense) transformation. addition, 3-form dab discussed  curvature b. emphasized  (see p.80 example 7.1) obvious def- inition (9), cohomological groups depend general particular trivialization chosen e. means that, think connec- tion principal bundle (as gauge case), gauge equivalent may give rise dierent bs. makes perfect sense theory hand, term tr a2 (3) makes immediately obvious lagrangian l gauge invariant. whereas b transforms (4), must remain invariant. observations apply loop space formulation yangmills theory. since phase factor yangmills gauge invariant, loop space connection also gauge invariant. course lagrangian (5). hand, freedom transforming loop connection a, would mean changing phase factor physically measurable quantity. twisted de rham cohomology groups h a(x, e) topological in- variants dened whenever connection vector bundle e. connection appears many contexts may physically interesting, notably integrable systems. surpris- ing: connection ensures integrability lifts. following results easy consequences denitions may prove useful studying invariances systems. analogy usual euler characteristic manifold, make following denition1. denition euler characteristic twisted de rham complex 1applying noncommutative geometry methods foliation induced connection a, one study -invariant (related global anomalies) sensitive euler characteristic dened less sensitive de rham cohomology groups: depends gauge equivalence class a. reported elsewhere . 4 (x, e, da) dened (x, e) = x (1)i dim(h a(x, e)).
