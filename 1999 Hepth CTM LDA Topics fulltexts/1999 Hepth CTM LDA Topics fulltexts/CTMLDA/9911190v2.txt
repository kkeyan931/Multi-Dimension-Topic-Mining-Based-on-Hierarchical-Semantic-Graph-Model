abstract

we study supersymmetric orientifolds where the world-sheet parity transformation is com-

bined with a conjugation of some compact complex coordinates. we investigate their

t-duality relation to standard orientifolds and discuss the origin of continuous and dis-

crete moduli. in contrast to standard orientifolds, the antisymmetric tensor describes a

continuous deformation, while the o-diagonal part of the metric is frozen to quantized val-

ues and is responsible for the rank reduction of the gauge group. we also give a geometrical

interpretation of some recently constructed six-dimensional permutational orientifolds.

1. introduction

since the early work of bianchi, pradisi and sagnotti [1], it is known that type i

string vacua involve both continuous and discrete moduli. thus, in the case of ordinary

orientifolds based on the world-sheet parity  [2], discrete internal backgrounds for the ns-

ns two-form, bab, are still allowed, although the corresponding (continuous) deformations

are projected out. a background b-eld generically leads to a rank reduction for the gauge

group, while, in the case of orbifold compactications, extra multiplicities appear in some

open string sectors [3].

in a recent paper [4] a new class of six-dimensional orientifolds of the type iib string

has been studied. they involve the combined action of the world-sheet parity  with a
conjugation [5] r of the internal complex coordinates and a geometric zn action. the new
feature arising in these orientifolds is that the klein bottle amplitude receives contributions

from all zn twisted sectors. after an s transformation to the transverse tree-channel, these

lead to new tadpoles whose cancellation requires (dierent types of) d7-branes intersecting

at non-trivial (quantized) angles. then, strings stretched between dierent d7-branes give

rise to new twisted open sectors crucially involved in tadpole cancellations. the resulting
models have n = (1, 0) space-time supersymmetry in d = 6 and are characterized by
chan-paton groups of reduced rank. while for the standard  projection this phenomenon

may be related to the presence of a quantized background for the ns-ns antisymmetric

tensor (both in toroidal [1] and in orbifold [3] compactications), a similar understanding
is missing for the r orientifolds of [4]. finding an appropriate description of the observed
rank reduction is the main motivation of the present letter.

as a simple example, in section 2 we study r orientifolds of type iia on a two-
torus and using t-duality we gain an understanding of the mechanism responsible for the

rank reduction.

in section 3 we study tadpole cancellation for this model, derive the

quantization rules for geometric moduli and show that they are consistent with the results
obtained in [4]. finally, in section 4 we study the six dimensional z2 r orientifold
and using t-duality give an alternative geometric interpretation of the extra multiplicities

present in the neuman-dirichlet open-string sector.

2. t-duality and r orientifolds

let us consider the type iib string on a torus t 2 with complex coordinate z = x2+ix1.

without loss of generality, one can choose the basis

e
1 = ir ,

e
2 = b + ia ,

in terms of which the complex and kahler structures are

u  = u 

1 + iu 

2 =

e
2
e
1

=

a
r

+ i

b
r

,

t  = t 

1 + it 

2 = b + iv  = b + ibr ,

(2.1)

(2.2)

where we have also turned on an internal background b-eld. it is well known that modding

2, t 
out by the world-sheet parity transformation , the three geometric moduli u 
2
survive the projection whereas, up to the identication b  b + z, the antisymmetric
tensor is frozen to the two possible values b = 0 and b = 1

1, u 

2 [1].

a t-duality along the x1 direction leads to the orientifold

type iia on t 2

r

,

(2.3)

where now the  projection is combined with the operation r : z  z. moreover, the
complex and kahler structures are interchanged, so that for the dual torus t 2

u = u1 + iu2 =

e2
e1

= b + ib/r

i/r

,

t = t1 + it2 = b + iv =

a
r

+ i

b
r

.

(2.4)

therefore, in the orientifold (2.3) the b-eld is a continuous parameter while the geometric
modulus u1 is frozen. the quantization condition 2u1  z expresses the fact that for all
other values of u1, the action of r on t 2 is not crystallographic. moreover, under t-
duality the periodicity b  b + z is mapped to the invariance of the complex structure
under integer sl(2; z) shifts.

in conclusion, from t-duality we learn that for 2u1  2z + 1 the rank of the gauge
group is halved. in the next section, for the orientifold (2.3) we discuss tadpole cancellation

in detail and conrm the above expectations suggested by t-duality.

2

3. tadpole cancellation for r orientifolds

let us therefore consider the compactication on a generic two-torus t 2, whose com-

plex (u = u1 + iu2) and kahler (t = t1 + it2) structures are related to the metric and
antisymmetric tensor by

g =

t2

u2 (cid:18) 1

u1

u1

|u|2(cid:19) ,

b = t1(cid:18) 0 1

0 (cid:19) .

1

(3.1)

the left and right momenta corresponding to the complex coordinates (z , z) on the t 2

are

pl =

pr =

1

u2t2 (cid:2)u m1  m2  t (n1 + u n2)(cid:3) ,
u2t2 (cid:2)u m1  m2  t (n1 + u n2)(cid:3) ,

1

(3.2)

where ma and nb denote the kk momenta and winding numbers. for generic values
of the u and t moduli, the type iib string is no more left-right symmetric. however,

one can impose the invariance under  and nd constraints on the allowed values of the

moduli. in particular, in the conventional type i string, obtained projecting the parent

iib with respect to the simple world-sheet parity [2], the real slice of the kahler structure
(the b-eld) can only take discrete values (2t1  z) [1]. this is consistent with the fact
that the excitations of the ns-ns two-form are no longer part of the physical spectrum

of the projected theory. moreover, the presence of a quantized ux for the b-eld implies
the reduction of the total size of the chan-paton gauge group by a factor 2r/2, with

r = rank(bab), and a continuous interpolation (via wilson lines) between orthogonal and
symplectic gauge groups [1].

actually, one can consider more general projections and dress the world-sheet parity

 with other type ii symmetries as, for instance, coordinate reections (t-dualities) in the

compact directions. for the two-dimensional torus there exist two additional possibilities,
namely the inversion of both coordinates, i : z  z, or of a single coordinate

r : z  z .

(3.3)

it is not dicult to see that i does not present any substantial dierence compared to
the standard  projection. in both cases, only the imaginary slice of the kahler structure

survives, while the resulting type i models correspond to compactications on t-dual tori

(with d7 and d9-branes, respectively).

3

however, new interesting features arise when the world-sheet parity is dressed with

the conjugation (3.3). a simple analysis of the massless spectrum reveals that the internal

components of the ns-ns antisymmetric tensor

now survive the r projection, while the mixed components of the internal metric

do not. therefore, in this case one expects that the antisymmetric tensor is a continuous

modulus of the projected theory, while some conditions have to be satised by the mixed

components of the metric. indeed, it is not hard to see that requiring invariance of the

parent theory under

results in a quantization condition for the real slice of the complex structure

r :

pl = p
r

2u1  z ,

(3.6)

(3.7)

in analogy with the standard case.

once the r symmetry of the parent closed string is restored, one can proceed as in
[2] to construct the open descendants. starting as usual from the klein bottle amplitude

k = 1

2 tr(cid:16)rpgso e2t(l0+ l0)(cid:17)

(3.8)

one realizes that it receives contributions from the lattice states satisfying pl = pr, which
are xed under r. the resulting amplitude in the direct loop-channel is

k = 1

e t

u2 t2

|m2+ t n1|2

,

(3.9)

and after an s transformation to the transverse channel leads to the amplitude

k =

in (3.10) we have written the contribution of the world-sheet fermions

(3.11)

in terms of level-one so(8) characters, and we have omitted the contributions of the

transverse bosonic coordinates and the integration measure.

the annulus amplitude can be computed in two ways. the rst, as in [4], is to place

d8-branes at x1 = 0 extending in the x2 direction and compute the direct-channel ampli-
tude taking care exactly of the kk and winding states in the x2 and x1 directions. the
other, followed here, is to start from the transverse channel, that involves only the sectors
of the parent theory that are combined with their conjugates. for the r projection,
these states are selected imposing pl = pr. given the quantization condition (3.7) on
the u1 eld, there are further restrictions on these allowed states:

2u1m1 , 2u1n2  2z .

(3.12)

as usual, these constraints are imposed inserting in the transverse tree-channel annulus

amplitude suitable projectors

involves signs 1,2 as in [1], that enforce a proper normalization of the u1 projector.
extracting the contributions of k, a and m to the massless tadpoles, one nds the
consistency condition

x1,2=0,1

1,2 = 2 ,

5

(3.16)

and, as a result, the total size of the chan-paton gauge group is reduced by a factor 2a

n = 25a .

(3.17)

thus, the gauge group is so(25a) or usp(25a) depending on the sign of 0,0 in

(3.18)

for u1  z its rank is not reduced, while for u1  z + 1
2 it is halved. also in this
case wilson lines connect continuously orthogonal and symplectic groups passing through

unitary ones.

we can now turn to analyze more complicated cases.

in [4], six-dimensional r
orientifolds with n = (1, 0) space-time supersymmetry were studied. in particular, the
orientifolds

type iib on t 2  t 2

{r, zn}

(3.19)

with n = 3, 4, 6 were considered. in order to dene perturbatively consistent orientifolds,

the lattices had to allow a crystallographic action of the zn orbifold group and had also
to be oriented in specic ways relative to the mirror plane of r. the massless spectra of
the orientifolds (3.19) had the generic feature of rank reductions of the gauge groups by

powers of two. for instance, for the z3 model a natural choice was the lattice a depicted

in fig. 1, both in the (67) and (89) planes.

one can see that the background involves a quantized value u1  z+ 1
2 of the real component
of the complex structure. one thus expects a rank reduction of the gauge group by a
factor of two for each t 2, indeed consistent with the so(8) gauge group derived in [4] for

this model. for the tadpole cancellation condition and the computation of the massless

spectrum, it is important to know how the z3 xed points transform under the reection
r. for the lattice in fig. 1 one of the nine xed points is invariant while the remaining
eight are interchanged.

rotating the lattice by an angle  = /6 results in the unit cell b of fig. 2. by an

note, that for the lattice b all three z3 xed points of a single t 2 are invariant under
r. thus, besides the t 4 torus aa there exist two more inequivalent choices, namely ab
and bb. going through the computation eventually leads to the anomaly-free massless

spectra shown in table 1. particularly interesting is the bb model since it corresponds to

a dual heterotic string with a frozen dilaton. notice, that all these spectra (aa, ab, bb)

have already appeared in the study of open descendants of six-dimensional gepner models

7

[6]. moreover, the ab case was recently obtained in a study of asymmetric orientifolds

[7]. in the gepner construction, the various choices of elementary cells correspond to dif-

ferent modular invariant combinations of characters for the parent closed theory. a better

understanding of this correspondence could shed some light on the d-brane interpretation

of orientifolds of gepner models [8,6,9].

in analogy with the previous case, one would thus expect that the rank of the gauge group

is halved for this model. since z4 contains a z2 subgroup, tadpole cancellation requires

the introduction of two unrelated types of d7-branes and the unreduced rank of the gauge
group is 32. consistently, the z4 orientifold was found to have the gauge group u(8)u(8)
of rank 16.

finally, for the z6 orientifold the only consistent choice of the lattices was the z3 ab
conguration leading to a reduction of the gauge group by a factor of four. this is nicely
conrmed by the resulting gauge group u(4)  u(4) found in [4].

four dimensional orientifolds with n = 1 supersymmetry discussed in the forthcoming

paper [10] display gauge groups that precisely reect the quantization rules for u1.

4. the z2 r orientifolds

as we anticipated in section 2, toroidal  orientifolds are related by t-duality to
toroidal r ones, where kahler and complex structures are interchanged. however, for
orientifolds of toroidal orbifolds the situation is a bit more involved, as under t-duality,
(zl, zr)  (zl, zr), in general the left-right symmetric zn action is mapped to a left-right
asymmetric zn

(zl, zr)  (e

2i

n zl, e 2i

n zr) .

(4.1)

thus, in general t-duality relates symmetric with asymmetric orientifolds, but for the z2
orbifold the action (4.1) remains left-right symmetric. in this particular case t-duality

identies

with

as a result, the two independent values of the quantized b-eld for the t 2 factors in (4.2)

are mapped to the corresponding a and b tori in figs. 3 and 4. for instance, the 
orientifold with vanishing b-eld corresponds to the r orientifold on the aa torus, as
indeed can be conrmed by a direct computation.

9

turning on a b-eld, or equivalently rotating the cells, leads to the expected rank

reduction of the gauge group and introduces multiplicities in the neuman-dirichlet sector,

that are crucial for the cancellation of the anomalies by a generalized green-schwarz

mechanism [11]. in [3], these multiplicities had been related to the (modied) structure

of the xed points in the presence of a non-vanishing b-ux, and indeed the xed points
of the z2 orbifold ll multiplets of dimension 2r/2. thus, a d5-brane in the presence of
a rank r bab corresponds to 2r/2 (equivalent) copies, each sitting at a xed point in the
multiplet, while the multiplicity 2r/2 in the 95 sector reects the number of equivalent

ways of building an n d string.

an alternative geometric description can now be given in the context of r orien-
tifolds. under t-duality, the d9 and d5 branes are mapped to d7-branes stretching along

the horizontal and vertical directions in figs. 3 and 4, respectively. in the a torus the
intersection number of these two d7-branes is one while it is two for the b torus1. thus,
in the r orientifolds, the extra multiplicities in the 95 sector translate into the intersec-
tion numbers of the corresponding d7-branes: one for the aa lattice (corresponding to

r = 0), two for the ab lattice (corresponding to r = 2) and nally four for the bb lattice

(corresponding to r = 4).
