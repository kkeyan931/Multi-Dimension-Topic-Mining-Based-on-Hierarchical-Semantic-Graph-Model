abstract

we present evidences that there is a 4d model satisfying the condi-
tions of renormalizability and dieomorphism invariance simultaneously
at 2-loop level. the traceless mode is treated perturbatively, while the
conformal mode can be managed exactly. the two conditions constrain
the theory strongly, and will determine the measure of gravitational eld
uniquely. quantum corrections of the cosmological constant are computed
up in part to 3-loop diagrams. how to remove the negative-metric states is
also discussed from the viewpoint of dieomorphism invariance in analogy
of the r gauge in the spontaneously broken gauge theory. the model
may be a candidate for the continuum version of 4d simplicial quantum
geometry realized in recent numerical simulations.

1 introduction

for a long time, many authors have been longing to construct a well-dened
4d quantum theory of gravity [1][16]. the renormalizability is a big problem
we must overcome. besides this we have to make a theory to be dieomorphism
invariant. furthermore, there are physical problems like the unitarity, or how
to dene the s-matrix in a fully uctuating geometry. as a rst step it should
be claried whether there is a model satisfying two fundamental conditions of
renormalizability and dieomorphism invariance simultaneously.
in this paper
we give evidences that the model proposed in the previous paper [16] just satises
the two conditions. the problem of the s-matrix and the unitarity in our model
is also discussed from the viewpoint of dieomorphism invariance at the end of
the paper.

on the other hand, there is a development in dynamical triangulation ap-
proach [17, 18, 19] to 4 dimensional manifold [20, 21]. recent numerical simu-
lations suggest that 4d simplicial quantum geometry with u(1) gauge elds is
likely to have a higher order phase transition than 1-st order [21]. naively, if
there is a continuum limit of 4d simplicial quantum geometry, it will satisfy the
conditions of renormalizability and dieomorphism invariance.

the dieomorphism invariant quantum theory is formally dened by the func-

tional integration over the metric as follows:

z = z [g1dg]g[df ]g

vol(di.)

exp[i(f, g)] ,

(1.1)

where f is a matter eld 2 and i is a invariant action. the measure of the metric
is dened by the norm

< g, g >g= z ddxggg(gg + ugg) ,

(1.2)

where u > 1/d by positive deniteness of the norm.
before the middle of 80s, the pertubation theory had been naively dened
by replacing the covariant measure with the measure dened on the background-
meric g as [g1dg]g[df ]g. this replacement, however, breaks background-metric
independence, or dieomorphism invariance which is nothing but the innitesi-
mal version of that. the renormalizability is also related to the problem of the
measure. this problem was not able to be overcome even by going to supergrav-
ity. it has then been believed that superstring theory [22] is a unique candidate
for the background-metric independent quantum theory of gravity [23].

at the end of 80s new approach has come out. the theory was formulated
in the way to preserve background-metric independence even after the measure
is re-expressed by one dened on the background-metric. 2d quantum gravity

was solved exactly by knizhnik, polyakov and zamolodchikov (kpz) [24] and
david, distler and kawai (ddk) [25] in this way, and then several 2d models,
dilaton gravity [26, 27, 28], r2-gravity [29] were studied. the idea can apply to
even dimensional quantum gravity, which is that to make the theory background-
metric independent we must add an action s as [16, 26]

z = z [d]g[ehdeh]g[df ]g

vol(di.)

exp[s(, g)  i(f, g)] .

(1.3)

the metric is now decomposed as g = e2g and g = (geh), where tr(h) =
0, adopted by kawai, kitazawa and ninomiya [30] and by the author [16]. the
measures of the metric elds are dened on the background-metric by the norms

< ,  >g= z ddxqg()2 ,
< h, h >g= z ddxqg tr(eheh)2 .

(1.4)

(1.5)

the action s is a contribution induced from the measures, and it is related to
the conformal anomaly. note that, usually an anomaly means that a classical
symmetry breaks down at quantum level, but now the anomalous contribution s
is rather needed to ensure dieomorphism invariance at quantum level.

the action s must satisfy the wess-zumino condition [31] to realize background-

metric independence, or z(e2 geb) = z(g), refered to the bmi condition in the
following, where  and b
 satisfying tr(b) = 0 are local functions. since the mea-
sure [ehdeh]g itself is invariant under the change eh  ebeh, the bmi condition
for the traceless mode stands for that g and h always appear in the combination
g = geh in the theory [16]. it is rather trivial condition, but it means that, when
we calculate s, we can guess the h-dependence if we can know the g dependence
of s.

besides being background-metric independent, namely, invariant under gen-

eral coordinate transformations

d

 +  ,

g = g  + g

(1.6)

the theory (1.3) should be renormalizable also. in 4 dimensions s is a 4-th order
one. in this paper we assert that the measure of 4d gravitational eld, including
s and 4-th order invariant action [5][12], will be uniquely determined by the two
conditions and then the integrability condition discussed by riegert, fradkin and
tseytlin [32] will be satised. here we emphasis that 4-th order terms are just
required by dieomorphism invariance, but are by no means introduced by hand
only for renormalizability as in the previous works [6][12].

2

this paper is organized as follows. in the next section, as a exercise before
going to 4d model, we briey review 2d quantum gravity from the viewpoint of
dieomorphism invariance. the kpz/ddk formula [24, 25] on sphere topology
is computed using dimensional regularization. in this model many fundamental
thoughts are included. in section 3 we study 4d model proposed in the previous
paper [16], which is slightly modied here. in 4 dimensions the traceless mode
as well as the conformal mode become dynamical. the perturbation theory is
applied to the traceless mode, where a dimensionless coupling constant t is intro-
duced, while the conformal mode can be managed exactly [30, 16]. the model
studied by antoniadis, mazur and mottola [13, 14, 15] as a full eective the-
ory of quantum gravity essentially corresponds to our model at the limit t  0.
in this section we present evidences that our model is renormalizable and dif-
feomorphism invariant, especially satises the integrability conditions discussed
in [32], up to order t2, or two-loop order for vacuum polarization of the traceless
mode. the higher-order renormalizability is also discussed from the viewpoint
of dieomorphism invariance. at the end of this section we compute quantum
corrections of the cosmological constant up to order t2, to which diagrams up to
3-loops contribute. the computation is quite analogous to 2d quantum gravity
though the equation to determine the conformal charge of the cosmological con-
stant becomes a biquadratic one at this order. it can be solved perturbatively.
we nally estimate the strength of the coupling t using the results of recent nu-
merical simulations [21]. the section 4 is devoted to conclusions and discussions.
at the end of this section we discuss how to dene the s-matrix and how to
remove the negative-metric states in the 4-th order theory required by dieomor-
phism invariance. then the role of the term  f in the wess-zumino action is
emphasized in analogy of the r gauge in the spontaneously broken gauge theory.

2 review of two dimensional model

in this section we re-investigate 2d quantum gravity with n massless scalar
elds x [24, 25]. since we want to extent arguments to 4 dimensions, we do not
here use conformal eld theories. the wess-zumino action s in 2 dimensions,
what is called the liouville action, is given by integrating 2d conformal anomaly
as

s(, g) =

=

a

a

gr

4 z d2xz 
4 z d2xqg(g + r) .

0

here the wess-zumino condition is dened by the equation

s(, g) = s(, g) + s(  , e2 g) .

3

(2.1)

(2.2)

one can easily prove that s satises the equation above by dividing the integral
region [0, ] into [0, ] and [, ].

the coecient a is determined by requiring dieomorphism invariance. let
us apply the general coordinate transformation (1.6) and x = x, to the
expression (1.3). the action i is invariant such that i(x, g) = 0, but s is not
and we get the following expression:

s(, g) =

a

8 z d2xqg  r .

(2.3)

this is easily proved by decomposing the general coordinate transformation into
two parts as  =  +  and noting that s is invariant under , where  is the
transformation law in which  transforms as if it were a scalar eld on the metric
g such that g = g +g  and  = , while  is the conformal
change of the metric g and the local shift of  dened by  g = 2g and
 =  with

 = 

1
2

 .

(2.4)

(2.5)

since  is innitesimal, the r.h.s. of (2.3) can be expressed as s(, g) using (2.4).
thus (2.3) is nothing but the wess-zumino condition (2.2) with the innitesimal
value (2.4).

on the other hand the measures themself are not invariant, which conformally
[d](1+2)g[ehdeh](1+2)g[dx](1+2)g, where  is given by
change in the forms:
(2.4). we rst evaluate the measure of traceless mode. let us take the gauge-
xing condition ( p 

1 g) = g = 0 as usual. then we obtain
[ehdeh]g
vol(di.)

= [ehdeh]g det p 
1

p1( p 

1 g) ,

[d ](det p

as is well-known, in two dimensions, the r.h.s. can be further written in the
form [34]

p1)

2 ,

(2.6)

where [d ] = [ehdeh]g det p 
1 g) stands for the integration over the te-
ichmuller parameter. note that this rewriting is equivalent to taking the gauge
3 up to the zero mode and hence the gauge-xing term
condition h = b
bh  1
2bb, where b ia a symmetric traceless eld. then the ghost
action is given by bh|=c, which is the well-known bc-ghost system, where
b is the anti-ghost related to b and c is the reparametrization ghost. using
the well-known conformal property of the operator p1 [34], we obtain

[ehdeh](1+2)g = [ehdeh]g(cid:18)1 +

26

48 z d2xqg  r(cid:19) .

(2.7)

3if instead one chooses the ghost determinant as det p 
1

p1, one must treat the traceless mode

as a quantum eld [4, 30].

4

the measure of  is easily evaluated by using the bilinear term of the action
i = s + i as a regulator, which is that of a scalar eld. combined the results for
the traceless mode (2.7) and n + 1 scalar elds, we obtain

[dx](1+2)g[d](1+2)g[ehdeh](1+2)g exp(i)
= (1  u())[dx]g[d]g[ehdeh]g exp(i) ,

(2.8)

(2.9)

where

u() = 

25  n
48 z d2xqg  r .

thus the variation of the partition function (1.3) w.r.t. the general coordinate
transformation becomes

z = 6a + 25  n

48

(cid:28)z d2xqg  r(cid:29) .

therefore the dieomorphism invariance requires [25]

a =

1
6

(25  n) .

(2.10)

(2.11)

the lower dimensional operator in general receives a non-trivial quantum

correction. the cosmological constant operator r e, for instance, recieves the

quantum correction as

 = dim[] = 2 +  ,

(2.12)

where  is the anomalous dimension. in the following we consider the perturba-
n! n, and calculate  using

dimensional regularization [13, 15].

tion theory on  in the at background as e = p n
the combined action in d = 2  2 dimensions is

1

i =

4 z ddxqg(cid:20)a(cid:16)g + r(cid:17) + e + gxx(cid:21) ,

(2.13)

where the bc-ghost is omitted. the conformal mode  and the constant  are
now dimensionless, while the eld x has the dimension , where  is an ar-
bitrary mass scale. the strategy to compute the anomalous dimension using
dimensional regularization is as follows. consider that the coecient a in front
of the wess-zumino action is a bare coupling with dimension 2. we carry out
renormalization procedure with a unknown and compute the anomalous dimen-
sion. after regularization we take   0 and substitute the value of a required
by dieomorphism invariance into regularized quantities.
let us evaluate loop diagrams in the at background. we can easily see that
simple poles come only from the one-loop diagram in fig. 1. the sum of the
two-loop diagram (a) and the associated diagram (b) with one-loop counterterm
insertion shown in fig. 2 yields double poles proportional to 4. the higher-loop
diagrams do not also yield simple poles.

the contribution of one-loop counterterm is also depicted.

this value is exact to all orders of the perturbation. thus we obtain the quadratic

(2.16)

where we choose the solution such that   2 at the classical limit a  .
we now re-explain dieomorphism invariance in the context of dimensional
regularization. in the curved background we obtain the one-loop exact countert-

(2.17)

from dus argument [33], the variation of this counterterm w.r.t. the general
coordinate transformation, which is now converted into the conformal change of
the background-metric  g = 2g, gives the conformal anomaly u() (2.9)

6

because the conformal change of scalar curvature in d = 2  2 dimensions is
given by the identity

qg r = 2qg r =  qg r .

(2.18)

thus we obtain the value (2.11) as explained before. substituting the value into
the expression (2.16), we obtain the well-known kpz/ddk formula [24, 25] on
sphere topology.

3 four dimensional model

in this section we study a slightly modied version of the model proposed
in 4 dimensions the wess-zumino action becomes 4-th order one

in ref. [16].

(3.4)

which satises 4 = e4 4. thus, in order to ensure dieomorphism invariance
in 4 dimension the theory must be 4-th order one for gravity sector, and only in
that case the theory will be renormalizable also.

let us apply the general coordinate transformation (1.6) to the theory (1.3)

in 4 dimensions. the wess-zumino action then changes by

s(, g) =

as in two dimensions this is nothing but the wess-zumino condition (2.2) for the

(3.6)

the measure is also not invariant under the transformation, which conformally
changes in the form [d](1+2)g[ehdeh](1+2)g[df ](1+2)g with (3.6). the coe-
cients a, b and c are determined by imposing the condition of dieomorphism
invariance such that the -dependence from the action and one from the mea-
sures cancel out.

the regulator to evaluate the measures is now the combined action i = s + i,
which includes unknown constants a, b and c. if the -dependence of the deformed
mesure has the anomaly form (1  u())[d]g[ehdeh]g[df ]g with

where the coecients a, b and c are in general functions of a, b and c, the bmi
condition u + s = 0 is now written by the equation

a(a, b, c) = a ,

b(a, b, c) = b ,

c(a, b, c) = c .

(3.8)

to be able to impose the bmi condition it is necessary that the -dependence
of the measure is indeed expressed in the form above.
it forces matter elds
to be coupled with gravity conformally. as for gravity sector we must consider
the 4-th order invariant action whose form is restricted by the conditions of
renormalizability and dieomorphism invariance discussed below.

we consider the following invariant action including 4-th order terms 4:

i(a, g) = i4th + ile ,

where

i4th =

ile =

1

t2 f + dr2(cid:19) ,

(4)2 z d4xg(cid:18) 1
(4)2 z d4xg(m2r + ) + ia(a, g) .

1

(3.9)

(3.10)

(3.11)

i4th is the 4-th order part which could be regarded as a part of the measure. ile
is a usual 2-nd order action which describe low-energy physics. m2 is the inverse
of gravitational constant and  is the cosmological constant. in this section we
consider u(1) gauge elds, for example. ia is the action of na gauge elds.

we here introduced a dimensionless self-coupling constant t only for the trace-

less mode in the way [30, 16]

g = (geth) = g(cid:18)

(3.12)

as

where  = g. the bmi condition (3.8) is solved in the perturbation of t.

in the following we consider the model with [16]

d =

1
36

(2a + 2b + 3c) .

(3.14)

this condition means that the self-interaction terms of conformal mode in the 4-
th order part of the combined action i cancel out. this model is quite analogous
in this paper we assert that
to 2d quantum gravity discussed in section 2.
only in this case the theory becomes renormalizable and dieomorphism invariant
simultaneously in the perturbation of the traceless mode, where the coecients a,
b and c are determined uniquely by dieomorphism invariance.

3.1 renormalization

using dimensional regularization we regularize the model i = s + i with
(3.14) as a theory on the metric g. the plan of this and following subsections is
as follows. here we assume the renormalizability of our model and derive general
formulae on renormalization and dieomorphism invariance.
in the following
subsections, we will see that any inconsistency does not appear in our model at
least up to order t2. then the condition (3.14) plays a crucial role.

in this paper we consider m2 = 0 case, for simplicity. then the bare combined

action becomes

i =

(2a + 2b + 3c) r2 + e(cid:21) + ia(a, g) , (3.15)
where d = 42. a, b and c are considered as bare couplings with dimensions 2
and t is the bare coupling with dimension . for the later use we introduce the
dimensionless bare quantities, a, b, c and t dened by the relations a = a2,
b = b2, c = c2 and t = t, respectively. we here set the dimension of
conformal mode vanishing, while the traceless mode has dimension .

the renormalizations of quantum elds and couplings are dened by the fol-

lowing relations:

 = z 1/2

 r ,

9

h

 = z 1/2

h h
r

(3.16)

and

a = zaar ,

b = zbbr ,

c = zccr ,

t = zttr .

(3.17)

since the quantum traceless mode must be gauge-xed to carry out calculations,
we here introduce more well variable, or the background eld [35] for the traceless
mode dened by

g = (eth) ,

(3.18)

where h
dened by the relation [35]

 = 0. the renormalization of the background traceless mode is also

h

 = z 1/2

h 
r  .

(3.19)

on the other hand, since the dynamics of gravitational elds is ruled by the
4-th order derivative theory and matter elds are coupled to gravitational elds
conformally, the counterterms for the background eld become the 4-th order
ones

(3.25)

where tr is the dimensionless renormalized coupling. the coecients fn, gn, ln
and so on are in general functions of the dimensionless renormalized couplings
ar, br and cr.

the counterterms if and ig are conformally invariant at d = 4, espe-
cially ig becomes topological one, which is just an analog of the counterterm
(2.17) in 2 dimensions. in d = 4  2 dimensions the square of the weyl tensor
and the euler density satisfy the following identities [33]:

qgr fr = 2qgr(cid:18) fr +
qgr gr = 2qgr gr .

2
3

 rr(cid:19) ,

10

(3.26)

(3.27)

on the other hand the counterterm ir2 is not conformally invariant at d = 4
because r2 satises the identity

qgr r2 = 12qgr  r .

(3.28)

this counterterm is related to the renormalizations of the couplings a, b and c
and also the integrability condition of the wess-zumino action discussed in [32],
which is discussed in detail in section 3.3.

the renormalization of the background traceless mode is now dened by the

relation

1
t2

f =

r

fr  pf fr .

so we obtain the renormalization factor of the coupling

and the relation

(zt)2 = 1  pf t2

(3.29)

(3.30)

(3.31)

therefore the background-metric is not renormalized, and hence gr = g.

dieomorphism invariance now implies that the regularized eective action
composed of 1pi diagrams reg = ir + wreg satises the equation reg = 0, or
(3.32)

wreg(gr) =

r rr(cid:19) + br gr + cr r rr(cid:21) ,

where  is innitesimal value (3.6). the general coordinate transformation is now
converted into the conformal change  gr = 2gr. the r.h.s. of the equation
(3.32) comes from the variation of the action ir, while the l.h.s. corresponds
to the anomalous contributions from the measures u(). this equation will
determines the coecients ar, br and cr uniquely.

3.2 some results on renormalization factors

we here present some results on the renormalization factors discussed in the
previous subsection. let us rst compute the coecients f0, g0 and l0 in the
counterterms. they were already calculated in refs. [14, 16] by studying the case
t  0 in the curved background 5. the interaction terms among quantum elds
then vanish and the kinetic terms reduces to conformal invariant ones due to the
condition (3.14) such that

the coecients f0 and g0 are given by the values

l0 = 0 .

f0 =

the diagram (b) in fig. 3 is rather simple. the two terms in the vertex

int shown in (3.40) produce logarithmic divergences. the other terms including
derivatives of h give vanishing contributions. hence we obtain the following
divergence:

therefore the uv divergences as well as the ir divergences just cancel out in the
sum of (3.46) and (3.47) and we obtain

zbz = 1

(3.48)

at order t2
r.

this result is related to the counterterm ir2. since g r2 produces the

kinetic term 2 when the background eld of conformal mode g = e2 is
considered, the background-metric independence for the conformal mode implies
the relation of the renormalization factors zaz = zbz = zcz, where z is the
renormalization factor of the background conformal mode. since the background-
metric is not renormalized such that z = 1, we obtain the equations

z = 1 ,

za = zb = zc .

so the result (3.48) leads to

za = zb = zc = 1

r in pr2 (3.25) vanishes such that

(3.51)

here l1 = 0 is rather trivial because only the one-loop diagrams contribute to
order t2
r, which is a consequence that the cube and quartic self-interactions of
 are dropped by the condition (3.14). the result (3.51) is a evidence that the
action s satisfying the integrability condition [32] exists at tr 6= 0, which is
discussed further in detail in the next subsection.
r implies that the sum of the vertex diagrams
(a) to (b) shown in fig. 5 give nite contributions. it is likely to be so as in the
self-energy diagrams. but, the direct calculations will be quite tedious and we
will need a software to take contractions of tensor indices.

3.3 dieomorphism invariance at two-loop

in this subsection we discuss the condition of dieomorphism invariance (3.32)
at two-loop level. to make clear the origin of the interactions we divide the
combined lagrangian into three parts as follows:

f + la(a, g) ,

1
lc = 2b 4 +
t2
lcs = a f  + b g ,
 r +
ln c =

b

36

(2a + 2b + 3c) r2 .

(3.52)

(3.53)

(3.54)

here lc is the conformally invariant one. the expansion of lcs produces the
conformally invariant vertices linear to . on the other hand the last one ln c
yields non-conformally invariant vertices.
in the following arguments we omit tensor indices for simplicity. the weyl
tensor is then described as c and c 2 = f , where the subscript r can be dropped
because of gr = g. the euler density is also written as g = b2.

first we discuss the one-loop case [33]. at this order only the conformally
invariant lagrangian lc contributes to the eective action. from dimensional

15

analysis, the one-loop eective action should have the following form [36]:

w (1) =

t2
r
2



hrk4(cid:18) k2
2(cid:19)(cid:18)v
+ v(cid:19)hr + o()
f  c log(/2) c(cid:19) + v
f
g  b log(/2) b(cid:19) + v

 vf(cid:18)1
+vg(cid:18)1





f

g + o() ,

g

(3.55)

where v and v are symbolical coecients, while vf and vg and they with prime
represent true ones related to the conformally invariant counterterms if and
ig, respectively. the ir cuto mass is canceled out. going to the second line,
2! 2 log2 k2 +    is used. the coecients vf and vg have
(k2) = 1   log k2 + 1
already computed as vf = f0 and vg = g0 in (3.34). hence the counterterm reads

w (1) = 

f0


f 

g0


g

(3.56)

and the regularized eective action is described as

w (1)

reg = w (1) + w (1)

= f0 c log(/2) c  g0 b log(/2) b + v

f

f + v
g

g . (3.57)

the anomalous contribution is given by the variation of regularized eective

action with respect to the conformal change  g = 2g as

w (1)

reg = a0a + b0a

(3.58)

with

b0 = 2g0 ,

a0 = 2f0 ,

(3.59)
where a = ( f + (2/3)  r) and a =  g. to derive this expression we use the
following variational formulae:
 f = 2a ,
 g = 2a ,

( c log( ) c) = 2a + o() ,
( b log( ) b) = 2a + o() .

(3.60)
(3.61)

here note that, using the formulae, we obtain the equation w (1) = 0 7 such
reg = w (1) as used in section 2. thus, from the equation (3.32), we
that w (1)
obtain the values of ar and br at tr = 0 as a0 and b0, respectively.

the terms related to the non-conformally invariant counterterm ir2 in the
regularized eective action in general have the forms r log( /2) r and r2. the
term r log( /2) r breaks the condition of dieomorphism invariance (3.32)
7precisely w (1) = o(), which reects that the conformal invariance of lc violates by o()

in d dimensions.

16

and therefore it must vanish. it is now equivalent to the vanishing of l0 (3.33).
this means that in order for the theory to be dieomorphism invariant, the parts
of the action contributing to the one-loop eective action w (1) should be confor-
mally invariant. it is now ensured by the condition (3.14) for the gravitational
elds. matter elds must be conformally coupled to gravity. inversely, only in
this case the theory will become dieomorphism invariant. since the variation of
the term r2 is proportional to  r (3.28), this term determines the value of cr.
at the one-loop case, however, the conformal invariance is exact and hence such
a non-conformally invariant term vanishes. so the value of cr at tr = 0 vanishes.
r for zh). at this
order the non-conformally invariant terms in the action contribute to it. the
eective action of order t2

let us analyse the eective action of order t2

r is divided into three groups as

r (, or order t4

w (2) = w (2loop) + w (counter) + w (1loop) ,

(3.62)

where w (2loop) stands for contributions of two-loop diagrams, which are derived
from the conformally invariant lagrangian lc. the contribution from associated
diagrams with the one-loop counterterm insertion is represented by w (counter).
furthermore there are contributions of order t2
r, but one-loop diagrams described
by w (1loop), which include the vertices derived from lcs and ln c.
dimensional analysis, w (2loop) has the following form:

since two-loop diagrams have two internal-momentum integrals, from simple

w (2loop) =

(3.63)

here the dependences of the momentum and the ir cuto mass, (k2)2, (k22)
and (2)2 in each terms are the features of two-loop diagrams. on the other
hand, since the associated counterterm insertion diagrams are one-loop ones,
w (counter) should have the following forms:

w (counter) =

t4
r

hr(cid:18)

f0

+ d(cid:19) +(cid:18) 2

2(cid:19)(cid:18)e



+ e(cid:19)(cid:21)hr .

(3.64)

since the contributions of two-loop diagrams come from the conformally in-
variant lagrangian lc, the related two-loop counterterms becomes the confor-
mally invariant ones. the conditions of renormalizability and ir niteness give
constraints on the coecients. from the condition that the non-local divergence
 log k2
1
2 cancels in the sum of w (2loop) and w (counter), we obtain the constraint

17

2x  y + f0d = 0. the cancellation of the ir divergences gives the constraints
y = z = e = 0 and y + 2z  f0e = 0. hence we obtain the following expression:

the dieomorphism invariance (3.32) requires that w (2)

reg is proportional to
the anomaly forms a and a. this implies that the nite term including the
square of logarithm should vanish such that

xf = xg = 0 ,

(3.66)

h

which is equivalent to the vanishing of double pole in the two loop counterterm,
namely, the renormalization factor of the background traceless mode zh does not
have double poles of order t4
r. on the other hand, using the relation between the
renormalization factors ztz 1/2
= 1 (3.31) and the niteness of the -function,
one can easily prove that zh does not have double poles of order t4
8. thus the re-
r
lation ztz 1/2
= 1 guarantees that we can impose the condition of dieomorphism
invariance at two-loop level.

furthermore, the relation zt = z 1/2

implies that the diagrams with coun-
terterm insertions at vertices and at propagators cancel out each other and
hence w (counter) vanishes 9. the constraint on the ir divergences now becomes

the requirement of dieomorphism invariance is now equivalent to that the
non-local term r log( /2) r vanishes, or l
1 = 0. it is indirectly veried by
computing the self-energy diagrams of the conformal mode to order t2
r in sub-
section 3.2. from the viewpoint of the vacuum polarization of h, this implies
that the divergences contributing to l
1 in the one-loop diagrams which include
the vertices coming from the non-conformally invariant lagrangian ln c cancel
out. as discussed at the end of this subsection it is consistent with the result in
[16].

furthermore the non-local term  2 log( /2) which changes the form of
the wess-zumino action does not appear in the regularized eective action at
order t2
r. the background-metric independence for the conformal mode implies
that the vanishing of this term is equivalent to the vanishing of the non-local
term r log(/2) r.

the anomalous contribution at two-loop level is now given by

w (2)

reg = t2

r(cid:16)a1a + b1a + c1  r(cid:17)

(3.72)

19

with

a1 = 2f 

1 ,

b1 = 2g

1 ,

c1 = 12ul .

(3.73)

combining the one-loop results, the equation (3.32) is now solved as

ar = a0 + a1t2
br = b0 + b1t2
cr = c1t2

r +    ,
r +    ,

r +    .

(3.74)

the coecients a1, b1 and c1 are generally functions of the couplings ar and br,
while a0 and b0 are given by the constants. hence the bmi condition can be
solved perturbatively.

at higher order the conditions of dieomorphism invariance are expressed as
the vanishings of the non-local terms c logn(/2) c (n  2), b logn(/2) b
(n  2) and r logn(/2) r (n  1). each terms with n  2 are likely to
vanish to all orders as in gauge theories, which will be ensured by the relation
(3.31). the non-trivial condition is the vanishing of the term r log(/2) r.
this condition will be realized when we substitute the values ar, br and cr (3.74)
into the expression of the regularized eective action.

this seems a trick of dimensional regularization. if there is a regularization
dened exactly in 4 dimensions like the pauli-villars method, one will be able to
compute the eective action substituting the values of the constants an, bn and
cn required order by order into the bare action at the begining. then such a trick
will not be necessary, and we expect that all divergences will be renormalized
to the coupling t and matter elds and other dimensional constants, and the
wess-zumino action will not change the form.

the diculty to prove the renormalizability of our model originates the fact
that to preserve dieomorphism invariance the wess-zumino action should not
change the form, while the symmetry to preserve the form of the wess-zumino
action will be nothing but dieomorphism invariance itself. so what we can do
seems to be merely to check self-consistencies of the theory.
in this paper we
showed that our model can preserve dieomorphism invariance self-consistently
at n = 0 and 1 of order t2n. since the the extension to n  2 will be unique
due to the background-metric independence for the traceless mode, it is expected
that our model will preserve dieomorphism invariance at all orders.

we here comment on the works by kawai, kitazawa and ninomiya [30]. while
we apply the dimensional regularization to the theory i = s + i (1.3) dened
on the metric g, it seems that, as far as using dimensional regularization, one
could apply it to the theory (1.1) dened on the metric g with great care to the
conformal mode dependence as discussed by them. the dierence between two
methods is unclear at present. but, it seems that the two methods might be
same at   0, at least up to order t2
r because in this order the divergences of
the self-energy diagrams of the conformal mode cancel out for arbitrary values

20

of ar, br and cr. the detailed analysis on this matter seems important to prove
renormalizability at all orders.

to determine the values a1, b1 and c1 it seems that we have to carry out
full two-loop calculations. on the other hand, there is a naive argument that
the regulator of the measure is given by the bilinear term of quantum elds in
the combined lagranigan l = 1
, a). then,
using the special property of 4-th order operators, we obtain the annomalous
contribution formally expressed in the form [16]

2tk + o(3), where t = (, h

 2t r(cid:16)ek(cid:17) ,

(3.75)

where  is a cut-o. it is essentially a one-loop contribution, and hence deter-
mines the values of wf and wg. the proof in [16] on the wess-zumino condition
for 4-th order operators now means that l
1 = wl = 0, which is consistent with
what we mentioned above. here it is worth to comment on the previous work.
in the proof in section 3 in [16], it was assumed that the action s satisfying the
integrability condition [32] exists. therefore the proof means that, if being, the
variation of the part of the wess-zumino action s related to one-loop diagrams
is given by the quantity (3.75). applying the proof to our model, the existence
at t = 0 is guaranteed by the condition (3.14), but not at t 6= 0. however, since
the g dependence of s is determined by the background-metric independence
for the conformal mode, the h dependence of s is uniquely determined by the
background-metric independence for the traceless mode as mentioned in the in-
troduction. thus the existence of s, or wl = 0 at order t2 is guaranteed in our
model.

we here conjecture that only the one-loop diagrams contribute to wreg and
one obtains a1 = 2wf and b1 = 2wg because the quantity (3.75) is the most simple
expression giving the wess-zumino action at all orders. using the generalized
schwinger-dewitt technique [12] as in [16], we obtain 11

11in the previous paper we used the gauge-xing condition mixed the conformal mode and
the traceless mode. but, it is wrong because we do not introduce the coupling t for the
conformal mode. to ensure the gauge-independence we here use the feynman-type gauge,
and the coecients a and b are re-calculated. now the o-diagonal term in the operator k
becomes the 4-th order, but it can be managed in the perturbation by reducing the expression
of t r log k to the formula given in ref. [12] by using the identity like, for example,  v =

there is no counterterm insertion diagarms because all subdiagrams, namely,
the sum of (a) and (b) in fig. 3, the sum of (a) and (b) in fig. 8, and also (c)
itself in fig. 8, give nite contributions. furthermore the diagrams (a) and (b)
in fig. 9 each give nite contributions. the niteness of the sum of the diagrams
(a) and (b) in fig. 8 and of (c) in fig. 8 are evidences of renormalizability also.

let us compare our model with the dynamical triangulation approach to 4d
quantum gravity. in this approach there is no ambiguity in the choice of the mea-
sure contrary to the regges calculus. furthermore, although this lattice model
has the parameters coressponding to the gravitational constant and the cosmo-
logical constant, there is no dimensionless coupling tr unlike usual lattice gauge
theories. this indicate that, in continuum theory, the measure of gravitational
eld including 4-th order parts may be determined uniquely. here we estimate the
strength of the coupling constant tr realized in recent numerical simulations [21],
which suggest that  is imaginary for na = 0, but  becomes real for na  1.
recall that b0 is slightly greater than 4 for small value of na. so 0 is close
to 8. therefore the 3- and 4-terms and also the third terms proportional to

24

2 in the parentheses of (3.81) are estimated as the value of the order o(1)  t2
r,
while the second term in the parentheses which comes from the sum of the two-
loop diagrams (a) and (b) in fig. 6 is more than 10 times greater than them. if
|b1|  |b0| is assumed 12, the rst term in the parentheses is also small enough. so
we here neglect the terms of order t2
r except the second ones. then the equation
reduces to the quadratic one and we obtain the following discriminant:

j = b0

r  4 .

(3.83)

the results of the simulations [21] is now described as j < 0 for na = 0, but
j > 4 for na  1. there is a solution of the inequality, and we obtain the value
of the coupling constant: 0.018 < t2
r < 0.028. the corrections from the terms
neglected, mainly b1, are at most 0.005 under the assumption. the expression
(3.82) is valid in this region.

4 conclusions and discussions

in this paper we studied the problems of renormalizability and dieomorphism
invariance in 4d quantum theory of gravity. we considered the perturbation the-
ory for the traceless, where the dimensionless coupling constant t was introduced,
while the conformal mode was managed exactly. we found out evidences that
there is a model satisfying two conditions of renormalizability and dieomorphism
invariance simultaneously, and it will be uniquely determined to be the model
(3.9) with (3.14) if we do not introduce 4-th order elds except metric elds.
especially the vanishing of l1 and l
1 in (3.25), which has been required by the
integrability condition discussed by riegert, fradkin and tseytlin [32], gives a
breakthrough to two-loop renormalizability of 4d quantum gravity.

our conclusion seems plausible from the viewpoint of 4d simplicial quan-
tum geometry because dynamical triangulation chooses a measure uniquely, and
therefore the measure of the corresponding continuum theory may be determined
uniquely. we expect that it may be given by the 4-th order parts of our model.
the 4-th order model in 4 dimensions is quite similar to the 2-nd order model
in two dimensions. we can rather easily compute the quantum corrections of
cosmological constant up to order t2
r as in the case of 2d quantum gravity and we
obtain the biquadratic equation (3.78) with (3.81). quantum corrections of the
einstein-hilbert term are also quite important, which are remained in the future
problems.

polarizations.

so far we forcused only on the two fundamental conditions of renormalizability
and dieomorphism invariance. theories satisfying such two conditions might be
called quantum geometry rather than quantum gravity. to discuss quantum
gravity which will describe our universe we need to dene the s-matrix.

and evapolation. arrow lines denotes matter elds.
wavy lines are gravitational elds in the low-energy
asymptotic region. in re ball region, the 4-th order
terms are turned on.

recall, as computed in section 3.4, the cosmological constant receives non-
trivial quantum corrections because the propagators of gravitational modes are
proportional to 1/k4 and tadpole-type diagrams have logarithmic divergences.
this is a dierence between 4-th order theories and theories merely adding 2-nd
order negative-metric states. one can dene dieomorphism invariant correlation
functions in such a fully uctuating geometry. however, when one attempts to
dene the s-matrix, one reaches the problem how to dene asymptotic states
for gravitational modes. since the states are always dressed by the conformal
mode when the 4-th order kinetic term of the conformal mode exists, it seems
that one has to consider an unusual interaction picture that the 4-th order parts
are turned o in the asymptotic region, like a picture of quantum black hole
where the asymptotically at region exist (fig. 12) [38]. in this picture negative-
metric states in the 4-th order terms required by dieomorphism invariance do
not appear in the low-energy asymptotic region because there gravity is ruled by
the einstein-hilbert term. hence the negative-metric state is unstable and seems
conned in the internal high-energy region where the 4-th order terms are turned
on [39].

more directly, as a consequence of background-metric independence, or dieo-
morphism invariance, the presence of the term  f in the action implies that we
can remove the weyl term f by shifting the conformal mode by a constant. thus,
though in this gauge the theory becomes unrenormalizable, we can remove the
negative-metric state for the traceless mode. this situation somewhat recall us

26

the argument of r gauge in the spontaneously broken gauge theory [40].

let us compute the degrees of freedom in this case. now we must treat the
r2 term. then the anti-ghost related to b in (3.42) is absent. hence the
ghost action becomes ch|=c = ch|=c + (c  c), where c
is the anti-ghost related to b and c is the ghost of dieomorphism invariance.
the ghost determinant is now given by det1/2() det m gh
is
the usual ghost operator of dieomorphism invariance dened in [16]. note that
det() = det()|a scalar (see, for instance, [12]) so that the number of the
ghost degrees of freedom is 4 + 4 + 1 = 9. hence the total degrees of freedom
becomes 21+99 = 2. thus the negative-metric state related to the conformal
mode is also removed by ghosts. we expect that in general case the anti-ghosts
related to b may remove the negative-metric states for the traceless mode.
