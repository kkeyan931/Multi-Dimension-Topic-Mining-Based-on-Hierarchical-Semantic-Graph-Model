abstract

in this note we describe the most general coupling of abelian vector and tensor
multiplets to six-dimensional (1, 0) supergravity. as was recently pointed out, it is
of interest to consider more general chern-simons couplings to abelian vectors of
the type h r = dbr  1/2 crabaadab, with cr matrices that may not be simultane-
ously diagonalized. we show that these couplings can be related to green-schwarz
r f af b, and how the complete local lagrangian, that embod-
terms of the form brcab
ies factorized gauge and supersymmetry anomalies (to be disposed of by fermion
loops) is uniquely determined by wess-zumino consistency conditions, aside from
an arbitrary quartic coupling for the gauginos.

vector multiplets coupled to variable numbers of tensor multiplets in six-dimensional

(1, 0) supergravity arise naturally in perturbative type-i vacua [1], and are related by

duality to non-perturbative heterotic and m-theory vacua. the low-energy eld equations

of these (1, 0) models have revealed the explicit realization of a peculiar aspect of the

physics of branes: singularities in the gauge couplings appear for particular values of the

scalars in the tensor multiplets [2], and can be ascribed to phase transitions [3] in which

a string becomes tensionless [4].

in these models, that arise as parameter-space orbifolds (orientifolds) [5] of k3 re-

ductions of the type-iib string, several antisymmetric tensors take part in a generalized

green-schwarz mechanism [6, 2], and the resulting residual anomaly polynomial has the

form

cr
x cs

y rs trxf 2 tryf 2

,

where the f s denote collectively the riemann curvature and the yang-mills eld strengths,

the cs are a collection of constants (x and y run over the various semi-simple lie factors in

the gauge group and over the lorentz group) and  is the minkowski metric for so(1, n),

with n the number of tensor multiplets. taking into account only the gauge part of the

anomaly polynomial, the corresponding green-schwarz term,

br cx

r trxf 2

,

contains two derivatives, and thus belongs to the low-energy eective action. conse-

quently, the lagrangian has a classical gauge anomaly, that the wess-zumino condi-

tions [7] relate to a classical supersymmetry anomaly [8]. this model is thus rather

dierent from the other supergravities, since it is naturally determined by wess-zumino

conditions, rather than by the usual requirement of local supersymmetry. as a conse-

quence, the supersymmetry algebra contains a two-cocycle, and the resulting lagrangian

is determined up to an arbitrary term proportional to the square of a bilinear in the

gauginos [9]. moreover, as was shown in [10], the divergence of the energy-momentum

tensor is non-vanishing, as is properly the case for a theory that has gauge anomalies

but no gravitational anomalies, that could be accounted for introducing higher-derivative

couplings.

one can actually consider a slight modication of these couplings, resulting from the

inclusion in the low-energy lagrangian of green-schwarz terms non-diagonal in a set

of u(1) gauge groups. a direct indication of how this can work is provided by a recent

paper of cremmer, julia, lu and pope [11] where, in the search of the highest-dimensional

origin of various three-dimensional scalar sigma models, it is shown that the oxidation

endpoint of three-dimensional supergravity with scalars in f4 sigma models is (1, 0)

six-dimensional supergravity coupled to two tensor multiplets and two abelian vector

multiplets, with chern-simons couplings in a non-diagonal form. the model obtained in

this way actually motivates the study of more general green-schwarz couplings to abelian

vectors of the form

br cab

r f a f b

,

where the indices a, b run over various u(1) gauge groups, and the matrices cr, symmetric

under the interchange of a and b, may not be simultaneously diagonalized. in this paper we

describe this setting in detail, constructing the general coupling of (1, 0) six-dimensional

supergravity to n tensor multiplets and abelian vector multiplets, and then pointing out

the connection with the particular case considered in [11].

the n scalars in the tensor multiplets parameterize the coset space so(1, n)/so(n),

and are described by the so(1, n) matrix [12]

v =   vr

xm

r ! .

all spinors are symplectic majorana-weyl, the tensorinos m (m = 1, . . . , n) being right-

handed and the gravitino  and the gauginos  being left-handed (we follow the notations

of ref. [9]). the tensor elds br

 are valued in the fundamental representation of so(1, n),

and their eld strengths include generalized chern-simons 3-forms of the vector elds [11]

according to

,

where the crab are constants that determine the gauge part of the residual anomaly poly-

nomial

in the complete theory, the anomaly induced by this term would cancel against the contri-

bution of fermion loops, while the irreducible part of the anomaly polynomial is directly

absent in consistent models [13, 2]. gauge invariance of h r requires that

br =

.

the tensor elds satisfy (anti)self-duality conditions, conveniently summarized as [8]

grsh s =

,

where grs = vrvs + xm

r xm
s .

the construction of the model follows directly the method of ref. [9], where the com-

plete eld equations for the case of arbitrary numbers of tensor and non-abelian vector

multiplets were obtained requiring the closure of wess-zumino consistency conditions,

extending the results of [8] to all orders in the fermi elds (the coupling of (1, 0) super-

gravity to n tensor multiplets was originally studied by romans [12] to lowest order in

the fermi elds, while nishino and sezgin originally considered the coupling of a single

tensor multiplet to vector and hyper-multiplets to all orders in the fermi elds [14], and

later included some higher-order fermionic couplings in the model with tensor, vector and

hyper-multiplets [15]). the completion to all orders in the fermi elds of the equations of

motion is obtained requiring the closure of the commutator of two supersymmetry trans-

formations on the fermionic eld equations. all the equations may be derived from the

lagrangian

summarizing, the complete theory would contain additional non-local couplings induced

by fermion loops, whose variation would cancel the anomalous contribution of the con-

tact terms. thus, the low-energy couplings that we are displaying are properly neither

gauge-invariant nor supersymmetric. however, gauge and supersymmetry anomalies are

related by wess-zumino consistency conditions, and this grants the coherence of the con-

struction. the presence of the arbitrary parameter  reects the freedom of adding to the

anomaly the variation of a local functional, consistently with all wess-zumino conditions.

this anomalous behavior of the low-energy lagrangian is related to another remarkable

property of these models [9]: aside from local symmetry transformations and the equa-

tion of motion, the commutator of two supersymmetry transformations on the gauginos

generates the two-cocycle

dierent from zero for any value of . in six dimensions wess-zumino conditions close

only on the eld equations of the gauginos, and this two-cocycle makes these conditions

close for any value of . in the case of a single vector multiplet, in which the term of the

5

lagrangian proportional to 4 disappears, the two-cocycle is still present, although it is

of course independent of .

actually, due to the properties of (anti)self-dual tensors, the h 2 term in the lagrangian

vanishes identically. nevertheless, the equations of motion obtained varying l are the
ones that result from the supersymmetry algebra when the (anti)self duality conditions

are imposed. it is possible to apply the construction of pasti, sorokin and tonin (pst)

[16] in this case, following the results of ref.

[17], where this construction was applied

to the case of (anti)self-dual tensors coupled to non-abelian vector multiplets in (1, 0)

six-dimensional supergravity. since the theory describes a single self-dual 2-form

the complete lagrangian is obtained by the addition of the term

where  is an auxiliary scalar eld [16, 18] and h  = h  h. then, once the transfor-
mation law of the gravitino is properly modied, the supersymmetry algebra generates

the additional pst gauge invariances needed in order to cancel the additional degrees of

freedom [18]. the eld equations obtained from the complete lagrangian reduce to those

obtained from the lagrangian without the pst term, once these gauge invariances are

xed [16]. alternative ways of obtaining a lagrangian formulation for self-dual tensors

can be found in the literature. while in general these involve innite auxiliary elds [19],

kavalov and mkrtchyan [20] had obtained long ago a complete action for pure d=6 (1,0)

supergravity in terms of a single tensor auxiliary eld. their work may be connected to

the result of ref. [18] via an ansatz relating their tensor to the pst scalar.

as supersymmetry does not constrain the values of the coecients cr, we have obtained

a class of models whose anomaly polynomials can contain odd powers of the individual

eld strengths f a. it is interesting to compare these results with ref. [11]. although for

6

generic values of the cs the so(1, n) global symmetry is broken, the authors of ref. [11]

consider the amusing case of n = 2 with two abelian vector multiplets transforming in the

spinorial representation of so(1, 2). identifying this group with the one that transforms

the tensor elds, one obtains an so(1, 2)-invariant lagrangian if cr = 0r. in particular

the results of [11] correspond to the majorana representation of so(1, 2):

0 = 2

,

1 = i1

,

2 = i3

,

and for this choice the anomaly polynomial vanishes identically.

the transition to tensionless strings corresponds to values of the scalar elds for which

the gauge coupling vanishes [4]. in our lagrangian, this would correspond to the vanishing

of some eigenvalues of the matrix vrcrab. in the case of ref.

two-dimensional hyperboloid, described by the equation v2
2 = 1, and one can
show that the eigenvalues of the matrix vrcrab are both positive for v0  1 and both
negative for v0  1, and thus the transition is not reached.
