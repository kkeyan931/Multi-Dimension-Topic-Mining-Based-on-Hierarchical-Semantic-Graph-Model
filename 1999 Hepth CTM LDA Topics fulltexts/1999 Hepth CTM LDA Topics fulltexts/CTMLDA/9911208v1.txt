two-dimensional yang-mills theory: perturbative and instanton
contributions, and its relation to qcd in higher dimensions

two dierent scenarios (light-front and equal-time) are possible for yang-mills theories in two dimensions.
the exact qq-potential can be derived in perturbation theory starting from the light-front vacuum, but requires
essential instanton contributions in the equal-time formulation. in higher dimensions no exact result is available
and, paradoxically, only the latter formulation (equal-time) is acceptable, at least in a perturbative context.

1. introduction

the non-perturbative structure of non-abelian
quantum gauge theories is still a challenging topic
in spite of a large amount of eorts in the recent
literature. whereas perturbation theory provides
a well-established frame to describe the weak-
coupling regime, quantitative predictions for the
strong-coupling behaviour are extremely hard to
be obtained. though some non-perturbative fea-
tures are thought to be transparent, a consistent
framework in the continuum is still lacking.

such problems have often been tackled in the
simplied context of two-dimensional gauge theo-
ries (y m t2), taking advantage of the lattice solu-
tions [1]. as far as the continuum is concerned, in
two dimensions the theory looks seemingly triv-
ial when quantized in the light-cone gauge (lcg)
a  a0a12
= 0 . as a matter of fact, in the ab-
sence of dynamical fermions, it looks indeed free,
being described by a lagrangian quadratic in the
elds.

still topological degrees of freedom occur if the
theory is put on a (partially or totally) compact
manifold, whereas the simpler behavior on the
plane enforced by the lcg condition entails a
severe worsening in its infrared structure. these
features are related aspects of the same basic is-
sue: even in two dimensions (d = 2) the the-

plenary session talk at the meeting constrained dynam-
ics and quantum gravity 99, villasimius (sardinia-italy)
september 13-17, 1999.

ory contains non trivial dynamics, as immediately
suggested by other gauge choices as well as by
perturbative calculations of gauge invariant quan-
tities, typically of wilson loops[2]. we can say
that, in lcg, dynamics gets hidden in the very
singular nature of correlators at large distances
(ir singularities).

in order to fully appreciate this point and the
controversial aspects related to it, it is useful to
review briey the t hoofts model for qcd2
at large n , n being the number of colours [3].
in lcg no self-interaction occurs for the gauge
elds; in the large-n limit planar diagrams dom-
inate and the q q interaction is mediated by the
exchange

i
2|x| (x+),

d(x) = 
which looks instantaneous if x+ is considered a
time variable. eq.(1) is the fourier transform of
the quantity

k2


,

(2)

d(k) =
the singularity at k = 0 being interpreted as
a cauchy principal value. such an expression in
turn can be derived by quantizing the theory on
the light-front (at equal x+), a+ behaving like a
constraint [4,2].

the full set of planar diagrams can easily be
summed,
leading to a beautiful pattern of q q-
bound states with squared masses lying on rising
regge trajectories. this was the rst evidence,

2

to our knowledge, of a stringy nature of qcd in
its conning regime, reconciling dual models with
a partonic eld theory.

after this pioneering investigation, many in-
teresting papers followed t hoofts approach,
blooming into the more recent achievements of
qcd2.

still, if the theory within the same gauge choice
is canonically quantized at equal times, a dierent
expression is obtained for the exchange in eq.(1)

dc(k) =
can now be interpreted as a causal feynman prop-
agator [2].

(4)

this expression, rst proposed by wu [5], is
nothing but the restriction at d = 2 of the
prescription for the lcg vector propagator in
four dimensions suggested by mandelstam [6] and
leibbrandt [7] (ml), and derived in ref.[8] by
equal-time canonical quantization of the theory.
in dimensions higher than two, where physi-
cal degrees of freedom are switched on (trans-
verse gluons), this causal prescription is the
only acceptable one; indeed causality is manda-
tory in order to get correct analyticity proper-
ties, which in turn are the basis of any consistent
renormalization program[9].
it has been shown
in perturbative calculations [10] that agreement
with feynman gauge results can only be obtained
if a causal propagator is used in lcg.

this causal behaviour is induced by the prop-
agation of unphysical degrees of freedom (prob-
ability ghosts), which can be expunged from
the physical hilbert space, but still contribute
in intermediate lines as timelike photons do in
the qed gupta-bleuler quantization. the pres-
ence of those ghosts will have far-reaching conse-
quences in our subsequent considerations.

when eq.(4) is used in summing the very same
set of planar diagrams considered by t hooft, no
rising regge trajectories are found in the spec-
trum of the q q-system. the bound-state integral

equation looks dicult to be solved; early ap-
proximate treatments [11,12] as well as a more
detailed recent study [13] indicate the presence of
a massless solution, with a fairly obscure inter-
pretation, at least in this context. connement
seems lost.

then, how can it be that the causal way to treat
the infrared (ir) singularities, which is manda-
tory in higher dimensions, leads to a disastrous
result when adopted at d = 2 ? in order to get
an answer we turn to an investigation concerning
the q q-potential.

2. the wilson loop

a very convenient gauge invariant way of look-
ing at the q q-potential is by rst considering a
rectangular wilson loop  with sides parallel to
a spatial direction and to the time direction

dxa(x)(cid:19)(cid:21)|0i,(5)
w =
the symbols t and p denoting temporal ordering
of operators and colour ordering, respectively.

the contour  can be parametrized as

1 (s) = (st, l) ,
2 (s) = (t,sl) ,
3 (s) = (st,l) ,
4 (s) = (t, sl) ,

1  s  1, (6)
describing a (counterclockwise-oriented) rectan-
gle centered at the origin of the plane (x1, x0),
with sides of length (2l, 2t ), respectively.

it is well known that the wilson loop we have
hitherto introduced can be thought to describe
the interaction of a couple of static q q at the dis-
tance 2l from each other. if we denote by
m(y, x; ) = q(y)e[]q(x)
the mesonic string operator, e[] representing
the gluon phase factor along the path  connect-
ing the couple, we can consider the overlap be-
tween the states qq at the times t = t and
t = t , that is the amplitude
m (l, t ) = h0|m(2l, t )m(2l,t )|0i.
(8)
if we insert a complete set of eigenstates |ni
which diagonalizes the hamiltonian of the system

(7)

qq at the distance 2l with eigenvalues en(l), we
easily obtain
m (l, t ) =xn
we can turn to the euclidean formulation replac-
ing t with it . if we denote by e0(l) the ground
state energy of the system, we get

|h0|m(2l, 0)|ni|2 exp(2ient ).(9)

m (l, t ) = exp(2e0t )
z 

de (l,e) exp[2t (e  e0)].

e0

(10)

unitarity requires the spectral density (l,e) to
be a non-negative measure (see eq.(9)). then
m (l, t ) is positive and the coecient of the ex-
ponential factor exp(2e0t ) is a non-increasing
function of t .

in the limit t   one can show [14] that
the wilson loop w is related to m (l, t ) by a
threshold factor

w  exp(4mt ) m (l, t ),
m being the static quark mass. in this way we
can dene the q q-potential

(11)

v(l) = e0(l)  2m.

if the theory connes, v(l) is an increasing func-
tion of the distance l; if at large distances the
increase is linear in l, namely

v(l)  2l,

we obtain an area-law behaviour for the leading
exponent, characterized by a string tension .

for d > 2 perturbation theory is unreliable in
computing the true spectrum of the q q-system.
however, when combined with unitarity, it puts
an intriguing constraint on the q q-potential. to
realize this point, let us consider the formal ex-
pansion
v(l) = g2 v1(l) + g4 v2(l) +  ,
g being the qcd coupling constant. when in-
serted in the expression exp[2v(l)t ], it gives
exp[2tv] = 1  2t(cid:2)g2 v1 + g4 v2 + (cid:3)
+2t 2(cid:2)g4 v 2

1 + (cid:3) +  .

(12)

(13)

at o(g4), the coecient of the leading term at
large t should be half the square of the term at
o(g2). this constraint has often been used as a
check of (perturbative) gauge invariance [4].
therefore, if we denote by cf (a) the quadratic
casimir expression for the fundamental (adjoint)
representation of su (n ) and remember that v1
is proportional to cf , at o(g4) the term with
the coecient cf ca should be subleading in
the large-t limit with respect to the abelian-like
term, which is proportional to c2
f .

such a calculation at o(g4) for the loop w has
been performed using feynman gauge in ref.[15],
with the number of space-time dimensions larger
than two (d > 2). the parameter d acts also as
a (gauge invariant) dimensional regulator.

the result depends on the area a = l t and on
t . the o(g2)-term
the dimensionless ratio  = l
is obviously proportional to cf ; at o(g4) we nd
that the non-abelian term is indeed subleading

t 2 v na  cf caa2 t 42d,
as expected.

(14)

therefore agreement with exponentiation holds
and the validity of previous perturbative tests of
gauge invariance in higher dimensions (see ref.[4])
is vindicated. this rather simple way of realizing
the exponentiation at d > 2 might have a deeper
justication as well as far-reaching consequences.
the limit of our result when d  2 is nite
and depends only on a, as expected on the basis
of the invariance of the theory in two dimensions
under area-preserving dieomorphisms. however
the non-abelian term is no longer subleading in
the limit t  , as it is clear from eq.(14); we
get instead [15]

).

2t 2 v na = cf ca a2
we conclude that the limits t   and d  2
this result is conrmed by a calculation of w
performed in lcg with the ml prescription for
the vector propagator [16,17]. at odds with feyn-
man gauge where the vector propagator is not a
tempered distribution at d = 2, in lcg the cal-
culation can also be performed directly in two

4

space-time dimensions. the result one obtains
does not coincide with eq.(15). one gets instead

2t 2 v na = cf ca a2

48

.

(16)

the extra term in eq.(15) originates from the
self-energy correction to the vector propagator.
in spite of the fact that the triple vector ver-
tex vanishes in two dimensions in lcg, the self-
energy correction does not. what happens is that
the vanishing of triple vertices when d  2 is
exactly compensated by the loop integration sin-
gularity at d = 2 leading, eventually, to a -
nite result. we would like to stress that this
anomaly-like contribution is not a pathology of
lcg; precisely it is needed to get agreement with
the feynman gauge result.

perturbation theory is discontinuous at d = 2.
we conclude that the perturbative result, no
matter the gauge one adopts, conicts with uni-
tarity in two dimensions. we recall that any
acceptable gauge (including the causal formula-
tion of lcg!) entails the presence of (probabil-
ity) ghosts at d > 2 (see ref.[4]). at d = 2 in
lcg these ghosts are the only surviving degrees
of freedom in perturbative ymt [2]; therefore a
possible violation of unitary is hardly surprising,
although the reason why ghosts are so dangerous
precisely in two dimensions is not yet fully clear.
taking advantage of the invariance under area-
preserving dieomorphisms in dimensions d =
2, staudacher and krauth [18] were able to re-
sum the perturbative series at all orders in the
coupling constant g in lcg within the causal
formulation, thereby generalizing our o(g4) re-
sult (eq.(16)).
in the euclidean formulation,
which is possible as the causal propagator can
be wick-rotated, and with a particular choice of
the contour (a circumference), they show that the
colour factors decouple from geometry and can be
summed by the simple matrix integral

(17)

where, for u (n ), df denotes the at integration
measure on the space of constant hermitian n 

n matrices and w(0) = 1. they get
n1(cid:16) g2a

this result can be easily generalized to a loop

from eq.(18) one immediately realizes that, for
even values of n , the result is no longer positive
in the large-t limit. moreover in the t hoofts
limit n   with g2n = 2g2 xed, the string
tension vanishes and eq.(18) becomes

connement is lost.
this explains the failure of the wus approach
in getting a bound state spectrum lying on ris-
ing regge trajectories in the large-n limit. the
planar approximation is inadequate when the q q-
interaction is described in a causal way.

however in lcg the theory can also be quan-
tized on the light-front (at equal x+); with such
a choice, in pure ymt and just in two dimen-
sions, no dynamical degrees of freedom occur as
the non vanishing component of the vector eld
does not propagate, but rather gives rise to an in-
stantaneous (in x+) coulomb-like interaction (see
eq.(1)). there are no problems with causality and
renormalization is no longer a concern.

if the wilson loop w is perturbatively com-
puted using expression (1), only planar diagrams
contribute for any value of n , thanks to the in-
stantaneous nature of such an exchange; the per-
turbative series can be easily resummed, leading
to the result (for imaginary time)

w(a) = exph

to be compared with eq.(18).

(21)

not only is this result in complete agreement
with the exponentiation required by unitarity; it
also exhibits, in the t hoofts limit n   with

g2n = 2g2 xed, connement with a nite string
tension  = g2
2 .

this explains the success of t hoofts approach
in computing the spectrum of the q q bound
states.

the deep reason of this good behaviour lies in
the absence of ghosts in this formulation; how-
ever we should stress again that it cannot be de-
rived in a smooth way from any acceptable gauge
choice in higher dimensions (d > 2). moreover
the connement exhibited at this stage is, in a
sense, trivial, since it occurs also in the abelian
case u (1), namely qed2.

we end up with two basically dierent results
for the same model and with the same gauge
choice (lcg), according to the dierent ways in
which ir singularities are regularized. moreover
we are confronted with the following paradox: the
prescription which is mandatory in dimensions
d > 2 is the one which fails at d = 2. what
is the meaning (if any) of eq.(18)?

3. the geometrical approach

in order to understand this point, it is worth-
while to study the problem on a compact two-
dimensional manifold; possible ir singularities
will be automatically regularized in a gauge in-
variant way. for simplicity, we choose the sphere
s2. we also consider the slightly simpler case
of the group u (n ) (the generalization to su (n )
is straightforward) [19]. on s2 we consider a
smooth non self-intersecting closed contour and a
loop winding around it a number n of times. we
call a the total area of the sphere, which eventu-
ally will be sent to , whereas a will be the area
inside the loop we keep nite in this limit.
our starting point is the well-known heat-
kernel expressions [1] of a non self-intersecting
wilson loop for a pure u (n ) ymt on a sphere
s2 with area a

the character of the group element u in the r (s)

sorbing suitable factors independent of n and of

ting wn(a, 0) = 1.

using the well-known formula for the characters
in terms of the set mi and taking symmetry into
account.

from eq.(23) it is possible to derive, for n = 1
and in the large-a decompactication limit, pre-
cisely the expression in eq.(21) we obtained by re-
summing the perturbative series in the t hoofts
approach [20]. this is a remarkable result as it
has now been derived in a purely geometrical way
without even xing a gauge.

actually, in the decompactication limit a 
 at xed a, from eq.(23) one can derive the
following expression for any value of n and n [21]

we notice that when n > 1 the simple abelian-
like exponentiation is lost.
in other words the
theory starts feeling its non-abelian nature as the
appearance of dierent string tensions makes
clear. the winding number n probes its colour
content. the related light-front vacuum, al-
though simpler than the one in the equal-time
quantization, cannot be considered trivial any
longer. the above result does not seem related
to any simple-minded reduction u (n )  u (1)n ,
as suggested by the abelianization of the theory
in axial gauges.

eq.(25) exhibits an interesting symmetry be-

tween n and n. more precisely, we have that
wn(a; n ) = wn ( a; n),

(26)

a =

n
n a ,

a relation that is far from being trivial, involving
an unexpected interplay between the geometrical
and the algebraic structure of the theory [21].

looking at eq.(26), the abelian-like exponen-
tiation for u (n ) when n = 1 appears to be re-
lated to the u (1) loop with n windings, the gen-
uine triviality of maxwell theory providing the
expected behaviour for the string tension. more-
over we notice the intriguing feature that the
large-n limit (with n xed) is equivalent to the
limit in which an innite number of windings is
considered with vanishing rescaled loop area. al-
ternatively, this rescaling could be thought to af-
fect the coupling constant g2  n

we remark that this large-n result reproduces
the resummation of the perturbative series (for

theory. this is not a coincidence, rather it pro-
vides a clue to understand its deep meaning.

we go back to the exact expressions we have
found on the sphere for the wilson loop (eq.23).
as rst noted by witten [23], it is possible to
represent wn(a,a) (and consequently z(a)) as
a sum over instable instantons, where each instan-
ton contribution is associated to a nite, but not
trivial, perturbative expansion. the easiest way
to see it, is to perform a poisson resummation

calculation.therefore in the following we single
out the zero-instanton contribution (fq = 0) in
eqs.(30) to the wilson loop, obviously normalized
to the zero instanton partition function [25].

at this point we remark that, in the decom-
pactication limit a  , a xed, the quantity
in the equation above exactly coincides, for any
value of n , with eq.(19), which was derived fol-
lowing completely dierent considerations. we
recall indeed that eq.(19) was obtained by a full
resummation of the perturbative expansion of the
wilson loop in terms of causal yang-mills propa-
gators in lcg. its meaning is elucidated by not-
ing that it just represents the zero-instanton con-
tribution to the wilson loop, a genuinely pertur-
bative quantity [25].

8

in turn it also coincides with the expression of
the exact result in the large-n limit, keeping xed
the value of n2a (eq.(28)). this feature can be
understood if we remember that instantons have
a nite size; therefore small loops are essentially
blind to them [21].

eqs.(41,43) are the deep root of eq.(17). they
explicitly show that considering the zero instan-
ton sector amounts to integrating over the group
algebra. eq.(17) is then recovered after decom-
pactication (a  ).

the correspondence between zero-instanton
sector and group algebra is
fairly general.
another example is provided by a wilson loop
calculation for
the adjoint representation of

the zero-instanton contribution is again ob-

the variables, express the vandermonde determi-
nants in terms of hermite polynomials and then
expand them using the completely antisymmet-
ric tensor. we integrate over z3, , zn taking
orthogonality into account. we are left with the

5. conclusions

we conclude that,

in the equal-time formu-
lation at d = 2, the area-law exponentiation
(eq.(21)) follows, after decompactication, only
by resumming all instanton sectors, a procedure
which changes completely the zero sector be-
haviour and, in particular, the value of the string
tension.

in the equal-time scenario instantons are re-
sponsible of the restoration of unitarity, which
was threatened by the presence of ghosts.

in the light of these considerations, there is no
contradiction between the use of the causal pre-
scription in the light-cone propagator and the ex-
ponentiation of eq.(21); this prescription is cor-
rect but the ensuing perturbative calculation can
only provide us with the expression for w (0).
we nd quite remarkable that both quantities
in eqs.(18) and (21) are (dierent) analytic func-
tions of g2. this is hardly surprising for eq.(18),
but not for eq.(21), if it is thought as a sum over
instanton contributions. its analytic behaviour is
at the root of the possibility of obtaining it by re-
summing a perturbative series in the light-front
approach.

the result above corroborates a long-standing
belief, namely that the light-front vacuum has a
much simpler structure than the one in equal-time
quantization.
in two dimensions such a conjec-
ture receives a precise quantitative support.

on the other hand the full poisson resumma-
tion of non-analytic quantities (the instanton con-
tributions) has to produce the analytic expression
one expects for the wilson loop in the heat kernel
representation. the zero-instanton sector instead
is analytic on its own and, we have shown, can be
obtained by integrating over the group algebra.

we should perhaps conclude with a comment
concerning higher dimensional cases, in particular
d = 4.

we believe that most of our results are typical
of the two-dimensional case. perturbation the-
ory at d = 2 +  is discontinuous in the limit
  0; on the other hand the invariance un-
der area-preserving dieomorphism is lost when
d > 2.
in a perturbative picture the presence
of massless transverse degrees of freedom (the

10

gluons) forces a causal behaviour upon the rel-
evant green functions, whereas in the soft (ir)
limit they get mixed with the vacuum. the light-
front vacuum, which also in two dimensions is far
from being trivial, in higher dimensions is likely
to be simpler only as far as topological degrees
of freedom are concerned. of course there is no
reason why it should coincide with the physical
vacuum since, after connement, the spectrum is
likely to contain only massive excitations. more-
over, to be realistic, matter should be intro-
duced, both in the fundamental and in the ad-
joint representation. although many papers have
appeared to this regard in the recent literature,
we feel that further work is still needed to reach
a satisfactory understanding.
