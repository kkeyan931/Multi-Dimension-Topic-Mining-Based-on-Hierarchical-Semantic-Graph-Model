abstract

we propose a new spontaneous supersymmetry breaking mechanism, in which extra com-
pact dimensions play an important role. to illustrate our mechanism, we study a simple
model consisting of two chiral superelds, where one spatial dimension is compactied
on a circle s1. it is shown that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken irrespective of
the radius of the circle, and also that the translational invariance for the s1-direction
and a global symmetry are spontaneously broken when the radius becomes larger than
a critical radius. these results are expected to be general features of our mechanism.
we further discuss that our mechanism may be observed as the oraifeartaigh type of
supersymmetry breaking at low energies.

1 introduction

recently, a very challenging possibility of large-scale compactication has been pointed

out in ref.[1]. the authors have discussed consequences of extra large-scale dimensions

and have proposed phenomenologically interesting scenarios. so, an extremely exciting

situation will be that not only extra dimensions but also supersymmetry might be observed

in the near future. if the scale of extra dimensions is not far from that of supersymmetry

breaking, it will be natural to think that supersymmetry breaking and compactication

of extra dimensions may have a common dynamical origin.

the purpose of this paper is to propose a new spontaneous supersymmetry breaking

mechanism by compactication. let us rst present a key idea of our mechanism below.
suppose that an (eective) potential v (ai) for scalar elds ai vanishes at some values ai
of ai, i.e.

one might then conclude that supersymmetry would be unbroken because of the vanishing

= 0.

(1)

v (ai)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ai= ai

vacuum energy. however, it is not always true. this is an essential point in our mecha-

nism. our spontaneous supersymmetry breaking mechanism will be a realization of the

following simple idea: if there exist some mechanisms to force vacuum expectation values
of aj for some j not to take the values aj, then the vanishing vacuum energy solution ai
in eq.(1) will not be realized as a supersymmetric vacuum . a simple mechanism to force

vacuum expectation values not to take nonzero constants has been proposed in ref.[3].

we shall apply this mechanism for supersymmetric eld theories to break supersymmetry

spontaneously.

in the next section, to illustrate our mechanism, we shall study a 3+1-dimensional
wess-zumino type model in which one spatial dimension is compactied on a circle s1

and show that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken. in sect.3, it is shown that the
translational invariance for the s1-direction and a global symmetry are spontaneously

broken when the radius of the circle becomes larger than a critical radius. in sect.4, our

mechanism is contrasted with the oraifeartaigh mechanism [4]. some comments are

given in the last section.

an interesting example of such mechanism has been found in a special class of supersymmetric models
[2], in which would-be supersymmetric vacuum congurations have been removed from quantum moduli
spaces due to quantum deformed constraints.

2 a model

to illustrate our spontaneous supersymmetry breaking mechanism, let us consider a 3+1-

dimensional wess-zumino type model consisting of two chiral superelds 0 and 1. the

superpotential we take is

w (0, 1) = g0  2
g2 

1
2

(1)2! ,

(2)

where the parameters g and  are chosen to be real and positive for simplicity. this

model has a global z2 symmetry

0  +0,
1  1.

(3)

it turns out that this global symmetry plays an important role in this model. the scalar

potential is given by

where a0 and a1 denote the lowest scalar components of 0 and 1, respectively, and

v (a0, a1) = |f0|2 + |f1|2,

(4)

f0 =   w (a0, a1)
f1 =   w (a0, a1)

since the scalar potential v (a0, a1) would vanish at a0 = 0 and a1 = 
g , supersym-
metry might be unbroken, while the z2 symmetry be broken, spontaneously. this is,

however, a hasty conclusion, as we will see below.

let us suppose that one of the space coordinates, say, y  x3 is compactied on a circle
s1 whose radius is r. since s1 is multiply-connected and the action has the z2 symmetry

(3), we can impose the following nontrivial boundary conditions associated with the z2

symmetry:

0(x, y + 2r) = +0(x, y),
1(x, y + 2r) = 1(x, y),

(6)

where x denote the coordinates of the uncompactied 2+1 -dimensional minkowski space-

time. it should be stressed that the boundary conditions (6) are consistent with super-

symmetry and that the action is still single-valued thanks to the z2 symmetry (3). an

2

important consequence of the nontrivial boundary conditions (6) is that any vacuum ex-
pectation value of 1(x, y) (or a1(x, y)) cannot be a (y-independent) nonzero constant.

it immediately follows that (would-be) supersymmetric vacuum congurations a0 = 0
and a1 = 
be invariant , the vacuum expectation value of a1(x, y) has to vanish, i.e.

should be ruled out. if we assume that the vacuum would translationally

2

replacing a0 and a1 by their vacuum expectation values in v (a0, a1), we nd

ha1(x, y)i = 0.

v (ha0i,ha1i = 0) =

> 0,

(7)

(8)

which implies that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken, as expected. in this model,

there is a at direction in vacuum congurations since the potential (8) is independent of
ha0i.

another way to see the supersymmetry breaking more explicitly may be to expand

the component elds in the fourier-series according to the boundary conditions (6).

into two parts as

and (2l1)
r(cid:17)2
, (cid:16) n
, respectively, where m = gha0i. here we would
like to make several comments on the mass spectrum. the rst comment is that the

this assumption is true only when the radius of the circle is smaller than a critical radius r = 1

supersymmetry breaking scale is found, from the mass splitting, to be of the order of .

the second comment is that the mass spectrum satises the following relations [5]:

the third comment is that the fermionic mode (0)
0

is massless and corresponds to the

nambu-goldstone fermion associated with the spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. the
bosonic partner a(0)
0

is also massless but its origin is quite dierent. a part of it will

correspond to the nambu-goldstone boson associated with the spontaneous breaking of
a u(1)r symmetry (with ha0i 6= 0). the masslessness of a(0)
is also guaranteed by the
existence of a at direction of ha0i (at least at the tree level). the last comment is that
choosing ha0i = 0 we nd that some of the bosonic modes a(2l1)
might have negative
squared masses for r > r = 1
2 . this observation suggests that the conguration (7)
may become unstable for r > r and that a phase transition can occur at r = r. this

is the subject of the next section.

3 spontaneous breakdown of translational invari-

ance

in the previous section, we have assumed the translational invariance would be unbroken.
it turns out that this assumption is not true for r > r, as suggested in the previous

section. we shall here discuss spontaneous breakdown of the translational invariance
for the s1-direction. to this end, we should take account of kinetic terms as well as

potential terms since the vacuum conguration might be coordinate-dependent. the

vacuum conguration will then be obtained by solving a minimization problem of the
functional k

e[a0, a1; r] = z 2r

kthe e[a0, a1] may be thought of as a potential in a viewpoint of the 2+1-dimensional minkowski

spacetime.

a0(y + 2r) = +a0(y),
a1(y + 2r) = a1(y).

4

in the following, we ignore the x dependence since we are interested in the vacuum

conguration, for which the translational invariance of the 2+1-dimensional minkowski

spacetime is assumed to be unbroken. we rst note that the vacuum conguration for

a0(y) and a1(y) should satisfy the following eld equations:

0 =

0 =

e[a0, a1; r]

a0(y)

e[a0, a1; r]

a1(y)

dy2  2a1(y)
+g2(cid:18)|a0(y)|2 +

1

2|a1(y)|2(cid:19) a1(y).

(14)

if the translational invariance for the s1-direction would be unbroken, the vacuum ex-

pectation value of a1 has to vanish due to the boundary conditions (13) and then the
functional e[a0, a1; r] becomes

e[a0 = const, a1 = 0; r] =

2r4

g2

.

(15)

using the eld equations (14) to eliminate the kinetic terms in eq.(12), we may nd

e[a0, a1; r](cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) e

g2 z 2r

dy( g2
 e[a0 = const, a1 = 0; r].

4 |a1|4 + g2|a0a1|2)

(16)

we have thus arrived at an important conclusion: if there would appear nontrivial solu-
tions (a1 6= 0) to the eld equations (14), then a1 = 0 is no longer a vacuum conguration
and the translational invariance for the s1-direction would then be broken spontaneously

(with the z2 symmetry breaking) since nonvanishing a1(y) inevitably has the y depen-

dence to be consistent with the boundary conditions (13). we should again emphasize
that (would-be) y-independent solutions a0 = 0 and a1 = 
consistent with eqs.(13). it turns out that for r  r = 1
2 there exists only the trivial
solution (a0 = const. and a1 = 0) to eqs.(14), while for r > r there will appear many

to eqs.(14) are not

2
g

other (nontrivial) solutions. this result may be seen by noting that a vacuum congura-
tion with a1 6= 0 can be realized only when a0 = 0 and ima1 = 0, and then by solving
eqs.(14) with the boundary conditions (13). the vacuum conguration for a0 and a1,
which minimizes e[a0, a1; r], has nally been found to be [6]

ha0(x, y)i = ( arbitrary constant
ha1(x, y)i = ( 0

(17)

with  = 1+k2 . here, sn(u, k) is the jacobi elliptic function whose period is 4k(k),
where k(k) denotes the complete elliptic function of the rst kind. the parameter k
(0  k < 1) and the radius r should be related through the equation

r =

k(k)


.

(18)

note that as k runs from zero to one the right hand side of eq.(18) increases monotonically
from r = 1
2 to innity. as expected in the previous section, a phase transition occurs
at r = r and the translational invariance for the s1-direction is spontaneously broken
for r > r.

we would like to comment on the normal modes of oscillation about the vacuum
conguration for r > r. in the previous section, we have observed that some of fourier
modes might have negative squared masses for r > r. this is merely due to the fact that
we have not taken the true vacuum conguration for r > r. in fact, we can show that

all squared masses are positive semi-denite, as they should be, if the elds are correctly

expanded in the normal modes of oscillation about the true vacuum conguration (17)
. we may then nd three massless modes (in a sense of real degrees of freedom): one

is bosonic and two are fermionic. the massless fermionic (bosonic) modes correspond to

the nambu-goldstone modes associated with spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetry
(the translational invariance for the s1-direction).

4 oraifeartaigh mechanism vs. ours

in this section, we would like to point out that our mechanism may be observed as the

oraifeartaigh type of supersymmetry breaking at low energies, even though we will also

point out several dierences between the oraifeartaigh mechanism and ours.

we shall rst summarize general settings to construct supersymmetric models based on
our mechanism. let ai be a (would-be) supersymmetric vacuum conguration satisfying
v ( ai) = 0 or w ( ai)
= 0 for all j. suppose that some of space dimensions are compactied
on a manifold which should be translationally invariant and be multiply-connected, like
s1. we then impose nontrivial boundary conditions on superelds, which have to be

aj

consistent with global symmetries of the theory. the crucial point is that the boundary

we have not, however, found any simple relations between bosonic and fermionic masses, such as
eqs.(11), though we can formally prove the vanishing of the supertrace strm2 in the whole space of the
spectrum.

6

conditions have to be chosen to prevent some of vacuum expectation values of ai from
taking the values ai. it turns out [6] that at least two chiral superelds are required for
our mechanism to work in wess-zumino type models and that the model presented in

sect. 2 is the minimum one. this may be contrasted with the oraifeartaigh mechanism,

in which at least three chiral superelds are required. in the oraifeartaigh mechanism,

superpotentials w (ai) should be chosen such that there are no consistent solutions to the

equations

w (ai)

aj

= 0

for all j.

(19)

on the other hand, in our mechanism superpotentials will be chosen to have (would-be)

solutions to eqs.(19) but to have no solutions if we further impose boundary conditions

on ai, which have to be inconsistent with eqs.(19).

in this point, our mechanism is

apparently dierent from the oraifeartaigh one.

let us next discuss a resemblance between the two mechanisms. to make our dis-
, a(2l1)

cussions simple, we will consider the model studied in sect.2 again. let w (a(2n)

)

0

1

be the superpotential for the fourier modes given in eq.(9). since the mode expansions

(9) have been done in a consistent way with the boundary conditions (13), we may not
need to take care of boundary conditions any more, as long as the fourier modes a(2n)
and a(2l1)

are considered. then, supersymmetry breaking might be observed by showing

that the equations

for all m and k

(20)

have no consistent solutions. in this sense, our mechanism might be thought of as a kind

of the oraifeartaigh one, though the model consists of innitely many (kaluza-klein)

modes. to see the resemblance between two mechanisms more explicitly, let us look at the

model from a low energy point of view. to this end, we shall restrict our considerations to
the light ve bosonic modes, a(0)
, and simply put other heavy modes
to be zero. we may then nd the equations (20) for a(0)

and a(1)

respectively.

it is easy to see that these equations have no consistent solutions. this

observation suggests that our mechanism may be observed as the oraifeartaigh type of

supersymmetry breaking at low energies.

5 comments

we have studied a simple 3+1-dimensional supersymmetric model, in which one spa-

tial dimension is compactied on a circle, to illustrate our spontaneous supersymmetry

breaking mechanism. it has been shown that supersymmetry is spontaneously broken for
r > 0 and also that the translational invariance for the s1-direction with the global z2
symmetry is spontaneously broken for r > r. these results will not be specic to this

model but are expected to be general features of our mechanism.

we should make a comment on the scherk-schwarz mechanism [7]. one might impose

nontrivial boundary conditions associated with a u(1)r symmetry. then, bosonic com-

ponents of superelds may satisfy dierent boundary conditions from fermionic ones. a

crucial dierence between the scherk-schwarz mechanism and ours is that the breaking `a

la scherk-schwarz is explicit rather than spontaneous at the level of global supersymme-

try. another dierence is that the scherk-schwarz mechanism will work for any choice of

superpotentials, just like supersymmetry breaking at nite temperature, while our mech-

anism will not.

the nal comment is as follows: an interesting supersymmetry breaking mechanism by

compactication has been proposed by dvali and shifman [8], who have called it dynam-

ical compactication. the authors have suggested the idea that our universe could spon-

taneously be generated in the form of a four-dimensional topological or non-topological

stable defect in higher-dimensional spacetime and that the low-energy observers trapped

in the core of the defect would not detect supersymmetry, although the vacuum of the

original higher-dimensional theory is fully supersymmetric. what we would like to point

out is that the supersymmetric model presented in sect.2 may be thought of as an explicit
realization of dynamical compactication in the limit of r   (k  1). in this limit,
the vacuum expectation value of ha1(x, y)i becomes
tanh  
2

(y  y0)! .

(22)

this is a single kink solution, which is just one of the topologically stable defects discussed

2
g

=

ha1(x, y)i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=

8

in the paper [8]. a key dierence from the dvali-shifman approach is that the topologically

stable solution (22) has been chosen as the vacuum conguration in our model (but not

chosen by hand). this could be an advantage of our approach.

we hope that our mechanism might shed new light on supersymmetry breaking. it

would be of great importance to construct phenomenologically realistic supersymmetric

models based on our approach.
