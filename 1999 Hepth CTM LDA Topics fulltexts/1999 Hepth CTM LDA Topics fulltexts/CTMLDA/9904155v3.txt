abstract

we discuss the possibility of the extension of the duality between
the webs of heterotic string and the type iia string to calabi-yau
three-folds with another k3 ber by comparing the dual polyhedron
of calabi-yau three-folds given by candelas, perevalov and rajesh.

1 introduction

some calabi-yau three-folds(=cy 3-folds) with base, cip1(1, s) and ber,
k3= cip3(u1, u2, u3, u4)[d] are represented in hypersurface in weighted pro-
jective 4-space, cip4.

cy3fold = cip4(u1, su1, (s + 1)u2, (s + 1)u3, (s + 1)u4))[(s + 1)d],

(1)

i=1 ui.

with d = p4
the type iia string on cy3-folds which have k3 ber and t2 ber with
at least one section is dual to the heterotic string on k3  t2 as pointed
out in [1, 2]. much research has been explored on cy3-folds with s = 1 and
u1=1 cases and f0 based case [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7]. s = 1 and u1=1 cases
are given by the extremal transitions or by the conifold transitions from f0
based cy3-folds [5, 6, 7].

thus far, cy3-folds which have been studied are constructed by using
dual polyhedra. some of them may be related to the hypersurface repre-
sentations of eq. (1) with s  2. however, identication between them has
some ambiguities and is complicated [9, 10, 11, 12]. therefore, the relation
between these results and the duality between the type iia string on cy3-
folds with s  2 to heterotic string on k3  t2 is not clear yet. there have
been three types of web sequences of heterotic - type iia string duality from
the terminal cy3-fold in a series [4, 5, 6].

(iii) in [6] may be the subset of (i) in [7], though the properties of dual
polyhedron are slightly dierent 1. (i) means the modied (i) in [5] with
extra tensor multiplets.

1 the dierence between dual polyhedron of (i) and (iii) is as follows [5, 6, 7]. the
dual polyhedra of case (i) have the modied dual polyhedra of k3 ber. for the case
(iii) in a series, the dual polyhedron of k3 ber is not modied. the highest point in the
additional points is represented by the weights of the k3 ber of the terminal a series in
this base. one point such as (0, , , ) is also represented by the part of the weight of the
terminal k3 ber. the following element in sl(4,z) can transform these polyhedra into
the dual polyhedron given by the ref. of [6].

side, the non-abelian instanton numbers should be modied as follows [4, 7]:

is the number of the tensor multiplets in d=6 n=1 compactication 6.

2  nt = 12  nt

1 = 12, k2 = k0

the puzzles which we would like to consider are as follows:

i: why (iii) and (iv) have the same hodge numbers for a series ? do (iv)
satisfy the duality ? though k3 bers of cy3-folds in (iv) are dierent from
those in (iii), is there any gauge enhancement for (iv) ?

ii: is it possible to obtain b or c versions of (iii) which satisfy the duality
by means of conifold transitions ? already, the method to construct dual
polyhedron was given by [6, 7] about this question. they pointed out that
their hodge numbers are obtained by shrinking of tensor multiplets [7].

iii: is it possible to obtain b or c versions of (iv) which satisfy the duality

by means of conifold transitions ?

iv: do the hodge numbers in b or c series of (iii) coincide with those

of (iv)?

v: are there any hypersurface representing cy3-folds with s  2 which

satisfy the duality from n0  4 ?

in section 2, we investigate prob. i. we also discuss prob. iii by using

the results of [4] and [7] in section 3.

4similarly to a, for b and c, the modications may follow

b-chain : k1 + m1 = k0
c-chain : k1 + m1a + m1b = k0
which we will discuss in this article.

1 + m0

1 = 12, k2 + m2 = 12  nt ,

1 + m0

1a + m0

1b = 12, k2 + m2a + m2b = 12  nt ,

5 29 is the dual coxetor number of e8one [4, 7]. the subtraction of one means the
freedom of xing the place where a tensor multiplet is created. the dual coxetor number
of e7one = 17 works for b-chain case when a tensor multiplet is created and that of
e6one =11 for the c-chain case [4, 7].

6in d=4 and n=2 case, these tensor multiplets become vector multiplets.

2 the duality in k3 bered calabi-yau 3-fold

we treat the extension from a-chain n0 = 2 terminal case. cy3 =
cip4(1, s, (s + 1)(1, 4, 6))[12(s + 1)] with k3 = cip3(1, 1, 4, 6)[12] ber have
the same hodge numbers as those examples given by [6, 8]. to see why
they coincide, we compare dual polyhedron of cy 3-folds. they are not
sl(4,z) equivalent. we represent them in the base where one of vertices
of dual polyhedron in the bottom denotes the part of its weight for the hy-
(s, s  1, 4(s + 1), 6(s + 1)) in this
persurface representation. it is
case. the base manifold under the elliptic bration is f2 for s = 1 case.
fi denotes hirzebruch surface. the dual polyhedron of fi has three ver-
tices : {~v1, ~v2, ~v1  i~v2}. an example of integral points in the dual polyhe-
dron of fi is given by {~v1 = (1, 0), (0, 1), ~v2 = (0, 1), (0, 0), (1, i)}.

the hodge numbers and the dualities in case (iii) are derived by investi-
gating the extremal transition of the dual polyhedron of f0 based cy3-fold
in [6].

by using dual polyhedra, we can nd a brations and base manifolds in
some cases [5, 7, 11, 12]. the upper sux in  denotes the dimension of the
lattice of a polyhedron. {(x1, x2, x3, x4)}  4 forms the dual polyhedron of
cy3-fold. {(x1, x2)}  2  4 represents the dual polyhedron of the base
under the elliptic bration of cy3-folds. in this paper, they are the blown
up hirzebruch surfaces. {(x2, x3, x4)} |x1=0  3  4 represents the
dual polyhedron of k3 ber of cy3-fold. {(x3, x4)} |x1=x2=0  2  4
are the dual polyhedron of common elliptic ber of cy3-folds and k3ber.
however, this is not a sucient condition of having elliptic bration. the
result of brations in cy3-folds is given in table 1.

in s  2 case, the additional integral points to f2 are {(i, i  1) with
2  i  s, (1, 1)} within the base. thus, for s  2 case, the base
manifolds remain blown up f2 since s+1
s  2. we can see the hodge number
of the base under the elliptic bration and nt from dual polyhedron, nt +1 =
h1,1(f2 blown up) = d1  2d0 = s + 2 (s  2), where di is the number of
i-dimensional cones [13]. nt coincides with case (iii) [6]. on the other side,
k3 brations of case (iii) change so that the base manifolds under elliptic
brations also alter to fi blown up (i  2) with including f0 and f2. in any

case, the bases under elliptic brations in case (iv) are birationally equivalent
to those in case (iii), which leads to the following identication. (iii) and (iv)
are connected by the extremal transitions within each sequences. nt = 0
cases are deformed to each other by the change of base manifolds, i.e., f0 
f2 by using a non-polynomial freedom of deformation [6, 14]. both cy
3-folds with nt = 0 are the same manifold with double k3 brations [14].

s=i,nt =i  nt =i, where  denotes dual polyhedron of case (iv) and 
denotes those of case (iii) [6]. the cy 3-folds constructed by [6] and those
with s are the same manifolds with double k3 brations 7. each cy 3-fold
with nt = i can be represented as a k3 bration in two inequivalent ways
as table 1.

7they are represented by the same dual polyhedra in [7].

the cy3-fold with s = 1 is the terminal case of a-chains with n0 = 2 in
the duality web [4]. if duality exists, then their hodge numbers must satisfy
the following conditions which comes from d=6 and d=4 theories as the
anomaly cancellation [1, 5, 6].

for cy3-folds side, g1 and g2 symmetries are due to the quotient sin-

of g1 (or g2) charged hyper multiplet elds, which is summarized in table

multiplets of g2 vanishes. we can see this by substituting n = n0 for
g0

2 = g2 case and n = nt for g2 = g2 for a series [6, 7].
8 this may imply heterotic - heterotic string duality.
9 we compared some superpotentials of type iib side in case (iii) and those in case (iv)
and examined the possibility to derive the terminal gauge symmetry by the method of [15].
we will give dual polyhedra of case (iv) in the next paper to report about superpotentials
more precisely.

10 they are perturbative gauge symmetries for case (iii) and may be non-perturbative

ones for case (iv) as nt = 0 case [14].

in this article, we have studied the property of cy3-folds with s  2 case
from a series. they are the same cy 3-folds as those constructed in [6],
which have double k3 brations.

table 5: the duality of (iv) about k3=cip3(1,1,2,4)[10] berd cy3-fold

for the puzzle iii, the conclusion is that the hypersurface representations
with s  2 cases from b series and c series in n0 = 2 satisfy the duality
of terminal b and c series with extra tensor multiplets 11. for example, b
and c series in s=2, their hodge numbers can be interpreted as those with
shrinking of two instantons from n0 = 2 case as the ref. of [7]. s  3 cases
are also explained by shrinking nt instantons from the terminal case with
the same g2 symmetry.

2= g2 terminal in (i) +h1,1 |g2= g2 terminal in (iv),
: h2,1 = 17h1,1, c series : h2,1 = 11h1,1.

(7)

this situation is quite similar to that of a series. they are interpreted as
the dualities obtained by unhiggsing of u(1) and u(1)2 from (iv) in a series.
for puzzle iv, candelas, perevalov and rajesh seemed to construct b and
c versions of (iii) and derived the hodge numbers already, though they do
not write them explicitly [7]. according to the description, hodge numbers
of them are the same as table 5 and table 7.

for the puzzle v, we examine k3 berd cy3-folds whose s=1 case is the

terminal case in the a-chains with n0 = 4. their k3 ber is

11 for b and c sequences, the modication of eq.

(6) is necessary. the change in
the hodge numbers, h2,1 according to the change of the terminal group is not only the
dierence of dim. g0
2 ( or dim. g2) [4, 7]. thus we compare the hodge numbers of
cy3-folds which have the same terminal gauge symmetry.

table 7: the duality of (iv) about k3=cip3(1,1,2,2)[6] berd cy3-fold

k3=cip3(1,2,6,9)[18]. the dual polyhedron of s = 2 case has following addi-
tional points (2, 6, 18, 27), (1, 3, 10, 15) and (1, 3, 9, 14),
which imply nt =1. h1,1 |s=2 h0
1,1 |s=1= 3. the terminal group should
change from d4 to g2 with rank 6. we can not nd g2 which satises the
extension of eq. (6). it seems that it needs another idea to see the duality
in this case.
we gratefully acknowledge fruitful conversations
