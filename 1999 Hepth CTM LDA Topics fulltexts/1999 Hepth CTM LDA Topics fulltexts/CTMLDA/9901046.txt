(, )2 (respectively, (, )1). 2 proof direct consequence compatibility antibrackets. follows proposition algebra marked functions rst (the second) antibracket closed respect second (respectively, rst) bracket. let 1i (respectively, 2) (locally) minimal set basis marked functions second (respectively, rst) antibracket. example, 1i transversal coordinates symplectic leaves second antibracket. conditions imposed compatible antibrackets naturally translate language marked functions. particular, rank assumption imposed antibrackets implies n independent marked functions antibracket; nondegeneracy condition implies functions 1i 2 independent. recalling assumption foliations ia : brations, see 1i (2) actually constitute local coordinate system n1 (respectively, n2). therefore, natural regard na manifold marked functions respective antibracket. position study noncommutative antibrackets. avoid technical complications, begin following instructive example. 2.1 instructive example simplicity, assume basis marked functions 1i 2 grassmann-odd. assumed foliations symplectic leaves antibrackets brations, exist base manifolds n1 n2, assume connected. since basis marked functions grassmann-odd, n1 n2 odd superspaces. algebra cn1 (cn2) actually grassmann algebra generated 1i (respectively, 2). follows proposition 2.1 rst antibracket determines skew-symmetric mapping ( , )1 : cn1 cn1 cn1 satisfying jacobi identity. fact, antibracket makes cn1 con- sidered linear space lie superalgebra, antibracket supercommutator; here, even element grassmann algebra cn1 considered odd element lie superalgebra, vice versa. however, discuss detail con- centrate instead quotient lie algebra.1 explicitly write antibracket cn1 (1i, 1j)1 = c k ij1k + . . . , (2.2) dots mean higher-order terms . follows skew-symmetry antibracket c k ji. moreover, rst order jacobi identity antibracket implies ij = c k c ij c n mj = 0 , mk + c jkc n mi + c ki c n (2.3) jacobi identity lie algebra whose structure constants c k ij. explicitly construct lie algebra. end, consider vector elds 1while letter preparation, received paper {$9811252$}, antibracket grassmann algebra corresponding given lie algebra considered slightly dierent context. li = (1i, )1 , (2.4) 3 form n -dimensional lie algebra modulo vector elds vanishing 1i = 0,  = c k ijlk + . . . . (2.5) proceeding similarly algebra cn2 marked functions rst antibracket, arrive vector elds satisfying r = (2, )2 , (2, 2)2 = c 2 + . . . . (2.6) (2.7) fact, li well r restricted submanifold l determined equations 1i = 0 , 2 = 0. allows us consider vector elds dened l. consequence rank conditions, li form basis l, r. also satisfy relations  = c k ijlk ,  = c r . follows compatibility antibrackets  = 0 . (2.8) (2.9) relations (2.8) (2.9) precisely left- right-invariant vector elds lie group corresponding lie algebra determined structure constants c k ij. thus conclude l dieomorphic g . 2.2 general construction turn general situation, allow basis marked functions arbitrary grassmann parities. mentioned above, identify marked functions rst (the second) antibracket functions n2 (respectively, n1). proposition 2.1 tells us antibracket ( , )1 (respectively, ( , )2) induces antibracket n1 (on n2), therefore na , = 1, 2, become odd poisson manifolds. let p1 n1 point antibracket (, )1 vanishes,2 i.e., (, )1|p1 = 0 , cn1. point evidently symplectic leaf antibracket (, )1 considered antibracket n1. let 1i coordinates neighborhood up1 n1 p1 1i = 0 p1.

(2, 2)2 = c (2)2 . (2.11) 4 structure constants c (0) also give rise lie algebra, denote g2. thus, associated pair lie algebras g1 g2 pair compatible antibrackets. note lie algebras g1 g2 dimensions. = c vanishing points pa na correspond submanifold l determined equations 1i = 2 = 0, 1i 2 considered functions m. dierent words, l = 1 2 p2. functions well-dened neighborhood ul l m. indeed, functions 1 2 up2, evidently neighborhood containing l. thus vector elds upa; choose ul = 1 1 p1 1 1 up1 1 li = (1i, )1 , r = (2, )2 . (2.12) dened entire neighborhood ul. observe vector elds restrict l. indeed, follows eqs. (2.10)(2.11) (li1j)|l = (r2)|l = 0 , li2 = r1j = 0 , (2.13) precisely conditions li r restrict l. next, consider l submanifold m1 = 1 1 p1 m. proposition 2.2 l lagrangian submanifold m1. particular, l n -dimensional. consider functions 1i vector elds li dened m1. proof proposition follows immediately relations (2.10) fact 1i independent functions m1. since m1 odd symplectic (i.e., antibracket ( , )1 nondegenerate m1) see li linearly independent l, therefore form basis l. treat vector elds r similarly, gives us another set globally dened vector elds l. summarize, theorem 2.3 l endowed globally dened vector elds li r satisfy  = c k ij(0)lk ,  = c (0)r ,  = 0 , (2.14) therefore, l dieomorphic lie (super) group g. corollary theorem, observe lie algebras g1 g2 isomorphic. finally, note case considered previous subsection, one zero p1 (p2) rst (the second) antibracket n1 (respectively, n2). thus, one submanifold l = 1 2 lie group associated antibrackets uniquely determined. 1 1 general case, however, families za na vanishing points hence family super lie groups. raises question whether dierent points za actually correspond dierent lie groups. address question here, however, turn instead converse problem constructing triplectic antibrackets corresponding given lie group. 5 3 inverse construction considerations provide us construction triplectic antibrackets dupli- cated odd cotangent bundle lie group. let g lie group g bundle g trivial. exist two natural ways identify g g view g lie coalgebra right-invariant 1-forms. corresponding lie coalgebra. well known cotangent g; rst one lie coalgebra left-invariant 1-forms g second view g since g canonical symplectic structure, also equip g g symplectic structure hence poisson bracket. thus canonical poisson brackets g g l g. g g r, subscripts r l indicating way identify g g recall changing parity bres, associate supermanifold every vector bundle. present case associate g supermanifold g (with denoting parity reversing functor), canonical antibracket (the one corresponding canonical odd-symplectic structure). thus g g r) also endowed natural antibracket. let xa local coordinate system g li = la xa basis gl considered left-invariant vector elds. let also 1i coordinates g l corresponding basis dual li. canonical antibrackets g g l (respectively, g g l (1i, xa)1 = la , (1i, 1j)1 = c k ij1k , (3.1) antibrackets vanishing.3 introduced structure constants via  = c k ijlk. way, also obtain explicit form canonical antibracket g g r. take direct sum bundles, = (g g l ) (g g r). equipped canonical triplectic antibrackets. proposition 3.1 canonical antibrackets g g r naturally induce pair compatible antibrackets = (g g r). antibrackets compatible, jointly nondegenerate satisfy rank condition formulated section 2.2. thus, every lie (super)group admits canonical triplectic bundle. l g g l ) (g g l , denote ( , )1, trivial (vanishing) antibracket g r; consider canonical antibrackets r. thus obtain r. second antibracket ( , )2 l g indeed, identify g g g g product antibracket ( , )1 product g g g g r constructed similarly. l g l g noted contrast group case, exist, general, natural triplectic bundle arbitrary manifold l. fact, construction triplectic bundle essentially requires base l parallelizable . fact may viewed serious limitation triplectic quantization present form. indeed, triplectic antibrackets cannot 3a similar construction case ordinary poisson bracket g g well known. generalization case antibracket considered  6 constructed (even formally) covariant way model whose target space non-at manifold. curved manifold, triplectic structure would dened locally would depend choice coordinates. contrast standard bv quantization , canonical antibracket exists odd cotangent bundle eld space. remarkable feature construction repeated standard (non- particular, exist pair compatible poisson brackets = r) every lie group. moreover, exists direct analogue theorem 2.3 super) geometry. (g g l ) (g g pair appropriately degenerate compatible poisson brackets. 4 conclusions shown triplectic structure (consisting pair appropriately degenerate compatible antibrackets) induces structure lie group intersection certain symplec- tic leaves antibrackets. interest pairs degenerate antibrackets originates triplectic quantization general gauge theories. triplectic scheme, however, one needs mutually commutative antibrackets, therefore group abelian, appears strong geometrical constraint applicability triplectic quantization. approach lie group structures somewhat reminiscent well-known fact one naturally associate lie algebra every symplectic leaf poisson bracket . triplectic geometry, lie algebra also corresponding lie group associated zero-rank symplectic leaf antibracket induced algebra marked functions. important point construction direct analogue ordinary (non-super) dierential geometry based standard poisson bracket. considered geometric structures induced intersection symplectic leaves compatible antibrackets. half full triplectic geometry. part concentrated manifold marked functions antibrackets; corresponding geometry studied case mutually commutative antibrackets . also interesting generalize case non-commutative antibrackets. another interesting aspect triplectic geometry related additional structure, odd vector elds v originating one-form f  compatible an- tibrackets. particular, f gives rise kahler structure manifold marked functions provided appropriate nondegeneracy conditions satised f. also endows l even poisson bracket. case considered paper, checked f determines left-right-invariant poisson bracket l. seems probable present construction generalized include poissonlie group structures. grateful a. m. semikhatov attention work fruitful acknowledgements discussions suggestions. also wish thank i. a. batalin, m. a. soloviev, i. v. tyutin especially, o. m. khudaverdian i. yu. tipunin illuminating discussions. work supported part rfbr grant 98-01-01155 intas-rfbr grant 95-0829. 7
