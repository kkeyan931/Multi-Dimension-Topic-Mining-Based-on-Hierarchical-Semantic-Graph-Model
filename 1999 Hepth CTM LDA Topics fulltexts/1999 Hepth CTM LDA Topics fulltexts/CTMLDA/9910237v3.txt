abstract

we show in a precise group theoretical fashion how the generating solution of
regular bps black holes of n = 8 supergravity, which is known to be a solution also
of a simpler n = 2 st u model truncation, can be characterized as nsns or rr
charged according to the way the corresponding st u model is embedded in the
original n = 8 theory. of particular interest is the class of embeddings which yield
regular bps black hole solutions carrying only rr charge and whose microscopic
description can possibly be given in terms of bound states of dbranes only. the
microscopic interpretation of the bosonic elds in this class of st u models relies
on the solvable lie algebra (sla) method. in the present article we improve this
mathematical technique in order to provide two distinct descriptions for type iia
and type iib theories and an algebraic characterization of s  t dual embeddings
within the n = 8, d = 4 theory. this analysis will be applied to the particular
example of a four parameter (dilatonic) solution of which both the full macroscopic
and microscopic descriptions will be worked out.

1 introduction

after the discovery of dbranes [1], there have been successful microscopic computations
of the entropy of some extremal and nonextremal black hole congurations which re-
produced, at the microscopic level, the expected beckensteinhawking behavior [2]-[6].
however, despite these encouraging results, an open problem, nowadays, is still to nd
a general recipe to give this correspondence based on rst principles other than specic
computations. actually, while gravity seems to describe the quantum properties of all
black holes in a unied but incomplete way, string theory seems to give nice answers but
loosing the unied character of the properties of dierent black holes. it would be nec-
essary to nd a microscopic but still unied way of describing black hole physics in the
context of string theory. in the last two years there have been in fact various attempts,
especially within the ads/cf t correspondence [7], to give an answer to this question
relying on some unifying principles but a denite answer has not been found, yet. for
recent progress in this direction see for example [8]-[14].

a complementary strategy, which could be helpful in this respect, is to take advantage
of the uduality properties of bps black holes (like for instance the invariance of the
entropy under uduality transformations) and use them to infer the common underlined
structure of very dierent black holes sharing the same entropy. in particular, if one is able
to give a precise correspondence between at least one macroscopic solution (ultimately
the 5 parameters generating one) and its microscopic description, and is really able to
act on it via duality transformations in a precise and explicit way, one could derive the
microscopic stringy description of any macroscopic solution. even of those solutions (as
the pure nsns ones) for which a microscopic entropy counting has not been achieved,
yet. the possibility of having a control, both at macroscopic and microscopic level, on all
regular black holes with a given entropy could shed further light on the very conceptual
basis of the microscopic entropy within string theory. this is the spirit this paper relies
on.

some time ago it has been shown that the generating solution of regular n = 8 black
holes can be characterized as a solution within the st u model [15]. such a model is
a n = 2 truncation of the n = 8 original theory [16]. any regular bps black hole
solution within this latter model preserving 1/8 of the original supersymmetries (as any
other regular bps black hole solution should be:
indeed the 1/2 and 1/4 solutions of
n = 8, d = 4 supergravity have vanishing entropy, [17]) is, modulo uduality trans-
formations, a 1/2 bps soliton of the n = 2 theory. this important result enables one
to concentrate on the rather simple structure of the st u model, then generating more

1

general (and complicated) solutions by uduality transformations. without specication
of the proper embedding in the mother n = 8 theory these st u model solutions can
be nsns, rr or of a mixed nature. this distinction, from the 4 dimensional point of
view, relies on the identication of the relevant (dimensionally reduced) 10 dimensional
elds which enter dynamically in the solution. of particular interest will be the solutions
which carry only charge with respect to vector potentials deriving from the dimensional
reduction of 10 dimensional rr forms. in principle these bps black holes can be de-
scribed microscopically by means of a suitable system of dbranes compactied on an
internal manifold (in the weak coupling limit). the choice of a particular point in the
moduli space of the theory dening the values of the scalar elds of the solution at ra-
dial innity, although uninuential as far as the macroscopic properties of the black hole
are concerned (nohair theorem), determines the particular dbrane conguration cor-
responding to the given solution in the opposite regime of the string coupling constant.
we shall consider in what follows two main embeddings of the st u model in the n = 8
theory: one in which the vector elds have a 10dimensional interpretation in terms of
nsns elds as opposed to the other in which the vector elds have a rr origin. these
two categories of embeddings are equivalence classes with respect to the action of s  t
duality (to be dened more rigorously in the sequel and in particular in the appendix).
within the equivalence class of the rr charged solutions, two particular representative
embeddings will be considered: one in which the six real scalars of the st u model (three
dilatons and three axions) come only from the compactied components of the metric
(gij) and an other in which the three axions derive from compactied components of the
antisymmetric tensor in 10 dimensions (bij). as we shall see, the two embeddings are
related by t duality along three orthogonal directions of the internal torus. the former
will be described in the framework of type iib theory and the latter in the framework of
type iia theory. black hole solutions in the above type iib embedding could be possibly
interpreted microscopically in terms of a system of d3 branes at angles, while those in
the type iia embedding may be interpreted in terms of d0 and d4branes with magnetic
uxes on the world volume of the latter (since the elds bij are coupled to the d4 branes
in a gauge invariant combination with the ux density fij). the embeddings of the st u
model within the n = 8 theory and the consequent interpretation of its elds (scalar
and vector) in terms of dimensionally reduced 10 dimensional elds are achieved using
the powerful tool of solvable lie algebras (sla). this technique will be briey reviewed
at the beginning of section 2.
in the subsections 2.1 and 2.2 the embeddings yielding
nsns and rr charged black holes will be dened, together with the action of s  t
duality on the elds in the sla framework. the mathematical details will be postponed

2

to the appendix. in section 3 we shall consider, as an explicit example, a four parameters
solution of the st u model, which can be easily characterized, at the microscopic level,
in terms of a bound state of d4 and d0 branes. the relation between macroscopic and
microscopic parameters will be particularly simple and immediate.

2 the microscopic nature of the st u model

the 10 dimensional interpretation of the elds characterizing a solution depends on the
embedding of the st u model inside the n = 8 theory. an ecient technique for a
detailed study of these embeddings is based on the socalled solvable lie algebra (sla)
approach. in the following we summarize the main features of this formalism while we
refer to [18] for a complete review on the subject.

the solvable lie algebra technique consists in dening a one to one correspondence
between the scalar elds spanning a riemannian homogeneous (symmetric) scalar man-
ifold of the form m = g/h (g being a noncompact semisimple lie group and h its
maximal compact subgroup) and the generators of the solvable subalgebra solv of the
isometry algebra g dened by the well known iwasawa decomposition:

g = h  solv

(2.1)

where h is the compact algebra generating h. a lie algebra gs is solvable if for some
integer n  1, its nth order derived algebra vanishes:

d(n)gs = 0
dg(1)

s  [gs, gs]

where

; d(k+1)gs  [d(k)gs,d(k)gs]

since the 70dimensional scalar manifold mscal of n = 8 supergravity has the above
coset structure with g = e7(7) and h = su(8), it can be globally described as the group
manifold generated by a solvable lie algebra solv7, whose parameters are the scalar elds
i:

solv7 = {ti}

i  ti

i = 1, . . . , 70

indeed the solvable group generated by solv7 acts transitively on mscal. considering the
n = 8, d = 4 theory as the dimensional reduction on a torus t 6 of type iia or iib super-
gravity theories in d = 10, the solvable characterization of the nsns and rr scalars in
the four dimensional theory was worked out in [19, 20] 2 and is achieved by decomposing
2in those papers the correspondence generatorsscalars referred just to one of the two maximal theories.
in the present paper we wish to give a precise geometrical characterization of the bosonic elds of the
two theories and to nd the relation between them.

the solvable algebra solv7 with respect to the solvable algebra solvt +solvs, where solvt
generates the moduli space of the torus mt = so(6, 6)/so(6)  so(6) (t = so(6, 6)
being the classical t duality group), and solvs generates the two dimensional manifold
sl(2, ir)/so(2) spanned by the dilaton  and the axion b (s = sl(2, ir) being the
sduality group of the classical theory). since in the formalism outlined above solvt is
naturally parameterized by the moduli scalars gij, bij (i, j denoting the directions inside
the torus), and solvs by  and b, the complement of solvt + solvs inside solv7 is a
32dimensional subspace of nilpotent generators parameterized by the 32 rr scalars 3.
the general structure of the solvable algebra dened by the decomposition (2.1) is the
direct sum of a subspace of the cartan subalgebra csa and the nilpotent space spanned
by the shift operators corresponding to roots whose restriction to this cartan subspace is
positive:

solv = ck  x+{e}

(2.2)

ck is the noncompact part of the csa and + is the space of those roots which are
positive (non vanishing) with respect to ck.

in the case of the n = 8 theory in d = 4, solv is generated by the generators of the
whole cartan subalgebra of e7(7) (which denotes the algebra generating the group e7(7),
whose cartan generators are noncompact) and all the shift operators corresponding to
the positive roots of the same algebra. the cartan generators corresponding to an or-
thonormal basis, correspond to the radii of the internal torus gii plus the dilaton  (i.e.
they are parametrized in the solvable algebra by ln(gii)/2 and ); the shift operators
corresponding to the positive roots of solvt are parametrized by the remaining t 6 mod-
uli; nally, the shift operators corresponding to the positive spinorial roots of solvt are
naturally parameterized by the rr scalars. the precise correspondence between the
positive roots of e7(7) and type iia and type iib elds is summarized in the appendix.
although this correspondence is xed by the geometry, in what follows we shall dene
algebraically two dierent classes of embeddings of the st u model within the n = 8
theory which describe nsns or rr charged solutions respectively. the embeddings
within each class are related by an s  t transformation which preserves, as a general
property, the nsns and rr nature of the elds. this transformation is implemented
on the scalar and vector elds through the action of the automorphisms (aut(s  t )) of
the st duality group sl(2, ir)so(6, 6) on the corresponding generators and weights,
3depending on whether the 32 representation of so(6, 6) has positive or negative chirality (i.e. 32+
and 32, described within two dierent constructions of the e7(7) algebra), the corresponding theory will
be type iia or type iib, as we shall see.

4

respectively. as far as the action on the generators is concerned, the inner automorphisms
will amount to a rotation of the cartan generators (separately acting on the radii and
the dilaton) and a redenition of the nsns scalars gij (i 6= j) and bij and of the rr
elds within the 32+ or 32 (type iia or type iib respectively). the action of the outer
automorphisms of d6 (the dynkin diagram of so(6, 6)) diers from the one described
above in the fact that it exchanges the 32+ with the 32 weights of so(6, 6) and thus
the type iia theory with type iib theory. this is consistent with the characterization of
t duality along a compact direction which we shall give in the sequel.

let us now recall the main concepts on how to dene the embedding of the st u model
from the reduction of the central charge matrix zab of the n = 8 theory to its skew
diagonal form, zn . the latter procedure is a su(8) gauge xing which can be dened by
setting all o diagonal entries of zab to zero, except the skewdiagonal ones, by means
of a suitable 48parameter su(8) transformation. the result is the central charge in its
normal form:

zn =



z1  0

0
0
0

z2 
0
0

0
0

0
0
z3  0

0

z4 



,

 = 

1

0

1 0 

(2.3)

this gauge xing corresponds to a 48parameter uduality transformation on the 56
quantized charges ~q = (p, q) and 54 scalar elds in the expression of the central charge
(16 of the 70 scalars are already absent in the expression of the central charge since
they belong to the centralizer of the normal form, see below) such that the four skew
eigenvalues of the central charge will depend nally only on 8 quantized magnetic and
electric charges ~qn = (pn , qn ) (the normal form for the quantized charges) and on 6
scalar elds which dene the vector and the scalar content of the st u model describing
the generating solution. the scalar manifold of this n = 2 truncation is:

mst u = " sl(2, ir)
so(2) #3

(2.4)

the centralizer of ~qn , which is dened as the maximal subgroup gc of e7(7) such that
gc  ~qn = ~qn , is so(4, 4) while the centralizer hc of zn is so(4)2, maximal compact
subgroup of gc. on the other hand the normalizer gn of ~qn , which is dened as the
subgroup of e7(7) that commutes with the centralizer, [gn , gc] = 0, is the isometry
group of mst u , [sl(2, ir)]3, while its isotropy group [so(2)]3 is the normalizer hn of
zn . given the central charge in its normal form, gn and gc are then xed within e7(7)

5

and therefore also the embedding of the nal st u model, mst u being given by gn /hn .
the scalar content of the latter model, in terms of the n = 8 scalars, is dened by
embedding solv(mst u ) into solv7, ~qn dene the quantized charges of the model, while
as usual the real and imaginary parts of the skew eigenvalues zk of the central charge
dene the physical dressed electric and magnetic charges of the interacting n = 2 model.
the above dened procedure of reduction of the central charge to its normal form,
when applied to zab in dierent bases, yields skew eigenvalues depending on the scalar
and charge content of st u models embedded dierently inside the original theory (the
algebras gn and gc  e7(7), generating gn and gc, would in general depend on the
original basis of zab). as we are going to explain in the following subsections there are
essentially two physically dierent classes dened by this embedding.

2.1 the nsns st u model

let us consider the central charge matrix in a basis z a b in which the index a of the 8 of
su(8) splits in the following way: a = (a = 1, . . . , 4; a = 1 . . . , 4), where a and a index
the (4, 1) and (1, 4) in the decomposition of the 8 with respect to su(4)  su(4) =
su(8) so(6, 6) (this is the basis considered by cvetic and hull in dening their nsns
5parameter solution, [21]). the group su(4) su(4) is the maximal compact subgroup
of the classical t duality group and decomposing with respect to it the 28 of su(8) will
dene which of the entries of z a b correspond to rr and which to nsns vectors (the
former will transform in the spinorial of su(4)2  so(6)2):

28  (6, 1) + (1, 6) + (4, 4)

(2.5)

the (6, 1) + (1, 6) part consists of the two diagonal blocks zab and zab and dene the
12 nsns (complex) charges, while the spinorial (4, 4) correspond to the odiagonal
block zaa and dene the 16 (complex) rr charges. the skewdiagonal elements which
will dene znn s correspond then to nsns charges (z12, z34, z12, z34) and therefore
the corresponding st u model will contain 4 nsns vector elds. let us work out the
embedding of gn and gc within e7(7). let the simple roots of e7(7)
4 be n whose
expression with respect to an orthonormal basis n is the following:

1 = 1  2 ; 2 = 2  3 ; 3 = 3  4

4 let us recall that the dynkin diagram of e7(7) is constructed by adding to the d6 dynkin diagram
7 of one of the spinorial representations
7(7) the algebra obtained by
7 to 6. as previously anticipated the scalars of type iia or type iib theories parameterize

consisting of the simple roots (i)i=1,...,6 the highest weight 
32 of so(12). we call e +
attaching 
respectively solv(e +

7(7) the algebra obtained by attaching +

7 to 5; e 

7(7)) or solv(e 

7(7)).

2
7 = 
2

(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5  6) +

2

7

(2.6)

in the sla formalism, we may parameterize the orthonormal basis of the cartan subal-
gebra {(hi)i=1,...,6, h7} by means of the 6 radii of the torus (gjj)j=4,...,9 and the dilaton
(a.1). the group hc = so(4)2  so(6)2  so(6, 6) consists of four
 as in eqs.
su(2) factors acting separately on the blocks (1, 2), (3, 4), (12), (34) of the central
charge matrix. the centralizer at the level of quantized charges gc on the other hand
is the group so(4, 4) regularly embedded in so(6, 6). if the latter is described by the
simple roots 1, . . . , 6, a simple choice, modulo s  t duality transformations, for the
dynkin diagram of gc would be 3, 4, 5, 6. the solvable subalgebra of gc consists of
only nsns generators. the algebra gn , being characterized as the largest subalgebra of
solv7 which commutes with gc, is immediately dened, modulo isomorphisms, to be the
[sl(2, ir)]3 algebra corresponding to the roots 1 = 27, 2 = 1  2 and 3 = 1 + 2.

the scalar manifold of the corresponding st u model has the form:

mst u =

gn
hn

=

su(1, 1)

u(1)

(1) 

so(2, 2)

so(2)  so(2)

(2, 3)

(2.7)

the reason why the above expression has been written in a factorized form is to stress the
dierent meaning of the two factors from the string point of view: the group su(1, 1)(1)
represents the classical sduality group of the theory and the corresponding factor of the
manifold is parameterized by the dilaton  and the axion b. in the same way it can be
shown that the second factor is parameterized by the scalars g44 , g55 , g45 and b45 and
its isometry group acts as a classical t duality, i.e.
its restriction to the integers is the
perturbative t duality of string theory. this nonsymmetric version of the st u model
is the same as the one obtained as a consistent truncation of the toroidally compactied
heterotic theory and therefore describes the generating solution also for this theory (the
string interpretation of the 4 scalars spanning the second factor in mst u is in general non
generalizable to the heterotic theory). therefore its corresponding microscopic structure
should be given in terms of ns states (fundamental string and ns5brane states).

2.2 the rr st u model

let us start with the central charge matrix zab obtained from z a b through an orthogonal
conjugation, such that the new index a of the 8 of su(8) assumes the values a =
1, 1, 2, 2, . . . , 4, 4, the unprimed and primed indices spanning the 4 of the two su(4)
subgroups previously dened. let us now consider the decomposition of su(8) with

7

respect to its subgroup u(1)  su(2)  su(6) (which is the decomposition suggested
by the killing spinor analysis of the 1/8 bps black holes) such that the 8 decomposes
into a (1, 2, 1) labeled by i = 4, 4 and a (1, 1, 6) labeled by ei = 1, 1, . . . , 3, 3. the 28
decomposes with respect to u(1)  su(2)  su(6) in the following way:

28  (1, 1, 1) + (1, 1, 15) + (1, 2, 6)

(2.8)

where the singlet represents the diagonal block zij, the (1, 1, 15) the diagonal block

zei,ej and the (1, 2, 6) is spanned by the o diagonal entries zi,ej. the skewdiagonal

entries which survive the gauge xing procedure dened above and thus entering the
new normal form of the central charge znrr are now z1 = z1,1,z2 = z2,2,z3 = z3,3
and z4 = z4,4, which are rr charges.
it is however interesting to notice that these
four (complex) charges are part of the set of 10 rr (complex) charges entering the
diagonal blocks (1, 1, 1) + (1, 1, 15). these charges can be immediately worked out by
counting the entries with mixed primed and unprimed indices (zab) contained in these
two blocks or, in a group theoretical fashion, by decomposing the (1, 1, 1) + (1, 1, 15)
in (2.8) and the (4, 4) in (2.5) with respect to a common subgroup u(1)  su(3) 
su(3) = [u(1)  su(6)][su(4)  su(4)]. both the decompositions contain a common
representation (1, 1, 1) + (1, 3, 3) describing 10 rr central charges. the 3 and 3 are
spanned by the values 1, 2, 3 and 1, 2, 3 of the indices a and a of the 4 and 4 respectively.
these charges correspond to the 1 + 9 vectors of an n = 2 truncation of the n = 8
theory with scalar manifold su(3, 3)/u(3)  su(3). a truncation of this theory yields
the st u model dened by the new su(8) gauge xing which brings the central charge
zab to the normal form znrr. the 4 complex charges in znrr will depend on all the
8 rr quantized magnetic and electric charges ~qnrr and the 6 scalar elds of the new
st u model. therefore, dierently to the previous dened class, in this case all gauge
elds (and hence the corresponding charges) come from rr 10 dimensional forms. the
centralizer so(4, 4) of ~qnrr is now no more contained inside so(6, 6) and therefore its
solvable algebra contains rr generators as well. as a common feature of the truncations
belonging to this class, the scalars entering each quaternionic multiplet split into 2 nsns
and 2 rr. indeed the centralizer so(4, 4) is now the isometry group of the manifold
so(4, 4)/so(4) so(4) describing 16 hyperscalars and therefore its solvable algebra has
8 rr and 8 nsns generators 5.

in order to specify a particular truncation within the class one should dene the

5notice that any solution within a calabiyau compactication of type ii string lies in this class.
indeed all the vector elds surviving the compactication come from rr forms, both for type iia and
type iib theories.

8

simple roots of so(4, 4) and of the isometry group [sl(2, ir)]3 of the st u model, which
in turn determines solv(mst u) and thus the scalar content of the model. an interesting
possibility is the one where the system of simple roots for so(4, 4) is chosen to be:

1 = 1 + 2 ; 3 = 3 + 4 ; 4 = 5 + 6
2 = 7

(2.9)

here the root 1 = 27 = p4

i=1 i + 2 belongs to the so(4, 4) root space.

in the
solvable language, since the cartan generator and the shift operator corresponding to
this root are parameterized by  and b respectively, these two scalars are now part
of a hypermultiplet, known as the universal sector. the isometry group of the st u
model which commutes with the above dened so(4, 4) centralizer is generated by a
[sl(2, ir)]3 algebra which is regularly embedded in the isometry group gl(6, ir) of the
classical moduli space of t 6 and dened by the following roots:

1 = 1  2 ; 2 = 3  4 ; 3 = 5  6

(2.10)

the scalar manifold of this st u model is now symmetric among s, t, u since it is con-
tained in the moduli space of t 6 (its scalars are all nsns but there is no  and b):

mst u =

gn
hn

=

su(1, 1)

u(1)

(1) 

su(1, 1)

u(1)

(2) 

su(1, 1)

u(1)

(3)

(2.11)

from table 2 we can read out the scalar content of this model: g45 , g67 , g8 9 and 3 radii
(the latter being cartan generators). the interesting feature of the above embedding
is that all the excited scalar elds come from the metric tensor g rather than from the
kalbramond eld b (on the contrary, and this is a common feature of all embeddings
falling in this class, all charges are rr). suppose we are working in the framework of
type iib theory, then this particular embedding could possibly be described in the weak
string coupling regime by a system of d3branes at angles.

let us denote the compact directions of the torus are x4,5,6,7,8,9 and the noncompact
spacetime coordinates are x0,1,2,3. it is interesting to consider an other embedding which
is obtained from the one above by acting on it by means of a t duality along the directions
x5, x7, x9 of the internal torus. in the sla language this operation is characterized by
three transformations 1, 2, 3 in aut(s  t ) (see the appendix) obtained by multiplying
the outer automorphism of d6 (5  6) with suitable weyl transformations on d6. the
automorphisms i act on the cartan subalgebra by sending h2,4,6  h2,4,6 and therefore
the corresponding elds transform in the following way: gkk  g1
kk , (k = 5, 7, 9). the

9

action of the automorphism  = 123 on the shift operators e, and therefore on the
corresponding axions, can be deduced from the general property  (e) = e ():

 (1  2) = 1 + 2
 (3  4) = 3 + 4
 (5  6) = 5 + 6

which implies on the corresponding axions (see appendix):

 :

g45  b45
g67  b67
g89  b89

(2.12)

a t -duality along an odd number of internal directions, which in our characterization
amounts to inverting the sign to an odd number of i, maps 32 into 32+ (see the ap-
pendix) that is type iib theory into type iia and this is consistent with known properties
of t duality. this new embedding sl(2, ir)3  su(3, 3)  e +
7(7) obtained by acting with
the tduality  in on the embedding of sl(2, ir)3 in e7(7) dened by eqs. (2.10) and
(2.11) is a type iia embedding in which the axions come only from internal components
of the antisymmetric tensor bij. it is natural to interpret black hole solutions within this
embedding, for instance, in terms of systems of d0 and d4 branes with magnetic ux
on the world volume of the latter, as anticipated in the introduction. the mathematical
details associated with the two rr embeddings described above (i.e. the one in type
iib and the t dual in type iia theory) will be dealt with in the appendix . these two
embeddings provide a convenient framework in which to look for the generating solution
and to give it a suitable dbrane interpretation in which a microscopic entropy count-
ing is aordable. in the next section we shall x on the type iia rr embedding and
consider, just as an example, a known four parameter solution, which is a pure dilatonic
one, and work out both its macroscopic and microscopic description, consistently with
the 10dimensional interpretation of its scalar and vector elds given in the appendix.

3 example: a pure rr solution and its microscopic description

let us now consider a specic example, namely a four parameter solution within the st u
model. from the macroscopic point of view this solution is analogous to the one described
in [22]. other macroscopic solutions of the st u model have been obtained, for instance,
in [23, 24, 25, 26].

let us very briey remind the structure of the st u model while a complete treatment
has been carried out in [25, 26]. the st u model is characterized by a n = 2 supergravity

10

theory coupled to 3 vector multiplets whose scalars spans the manifold mst u , eq.(2.4).
the total number of scalar elds in the game is 6 (zi = ai + ibi , i = 1, 2, 3) while the
number of charges (p, q) is 8 (4 electric and 4 magnetic). in the framework of the st u
model, the local realization on moduli space mst u of the n = 2 supersymmetry algebra
central charge z and of the 3 matter central charges z i associated with the 3 matter
vector elds are related to the n = 8 central charge eigenvalues in the following way:

z = i z4

, z i = hij

jz = ipi

z 

(3.1)

where ipi
 = 2bi(r) is the vielbein transforming rigid indices  (the one characterizing the
eigenvalues of the n = 8 central charge in its normal form, eq.(2.3)) to curved indices i
(see [25], section 3, for details).

the killing spinor equations characterizing the bps black hole solution translate into
rst order dierential equations for the relevant bosonic elds once suitable ansatze are
adopted. as a standard procedure, the vanishing of the gravitino transformation rule
along killing spinor directions implies a condition for the metric while the vanishing of the
dilatino transformation rules translates into equations for the scalar elds. the ansatze
for the metric g and the complex scalars zi are the following:

ds2 = e2u (r)dt2  e2u (r)d~x2
zi  zi(r)

(cid:16)r2 = ~x2(cid:17)

(3.2)

after some algebra one can see that the structure of the rst order bps equations turns
out to be the following:

dzi
dr
du
dr

= 2  eu (r)
=   eu (r)

r2 ! hij
r2 !|z(z, z, p, q)|

j|z(z, z, p, q)|

(3.3)

which is a system of rst order dierential equations. working out the underlined geo-
metric structure of the st u model, the above system of equations can be made explicit
in terms of the scalar elds and the quantized charges (p, q) characterizing the model.
this has been explicitly achieved in [25, 26] (where the same conventions and notations
has been used), see in particular the appendices for explicit formul.

in this section we shall focus a particular (4parameter) regular solution for which
the microscopic description turns out to be particularly nice. on this solution the central
charge eigenvalues z, z4 are pure imaginary. this condition xes not only the [so(2)]3

11

symmetry of the model but also the overall phase  of the four central charge eigenvalues
( = 0 mod 2), yielding just four independent invariants |z|,|z4|.

since the central charge z4 is set to be imaginary (i.e. z real), the system of eqs.

(3.3) may be rewritten in the simpler form:

dzi
dr
du
dr

jz(z, z, p, q) =  eu (r)

r2 ! z i(z, z, p, q)

=   eu (r)
=   eu (r)

r2 ! hij
r2 ! z(z, z, p, q)

(3.4)

it is possible moreover to show that the reality of z is consistent with the regularity of

the solution provided we set p0 = 0. the conditions z = z  (and therefore z i = z i,
see eq.(3.1)) imply that the three axions are doublexed: a1,2,3(r)  af
1,2,3. they require
also that three electric quantized charges vanish, namely: q1 = q2 = q3 = 0.

hence the quantized charges left are (q0, p1, p2, p3) and the system of rst order dier-
ential equations our solution has to fulll reduces considerably. indeed the equations for
the dilatons and for u decouple from the axions and may be solved independently:

db1

(p1b2b3  p2b1b3 + p3b1b2 + q0)

(p1b2b3 + p2b1b3 + p3b1b2 + q0)

(3.5)

the 3 equations for the axions and the one on the reality of the central charge give the 4
rindependent relations our solution should fulll:

= 0 =  (a1 b2 + a2 b1) p3 + (a1 b3  a3 b1) p2 + (a2 b3  a3 b2) p1

im z = 0 = (a3 b2 + a2 b3) p1 + (a3 b1 + a1 b3) p2 + (a2 b1 + a1 b2) p3

(3.6)

the xed values for the scalar elds (namely the values the scalars get at the horizon,
[27]) are:

1 = s q0p1

bf ix

p2p3 , bf ix

2 = s q0p2

p1p3 , bf ix

3 = s q0p3

introducing four harmonic functions as follows:

h(r) = a + k/r ( = 0, 1, 2, 3)

k0 = 2 q0

ki = 2 pi

(3.7)

(3.8)

it is easy to see that the following ansatzefor the bi and the scalar function u:

satises both the rst and second order dierential equations. choosing the metric to
be asymptotically at and standard values for the dilatons at innity, the four constants
a are set to be all equal to 1. the solution, consisting of the three bi, the doublexed
ai and u is expressed in terms of 4 independent charges (and four harmonic functions):
q0, p1, p2, p3. according to the ansatze (3.2) the metric has the following form:

(3.9)

ds2 = (h0h1h2h3)1/2 dt2  (h0h1h2h3)1/2 d~x2

and the macroscopic entropy, according to beckensteinhawking formula, reads:

smacro = 2 qq0p1p2p3

(3.10)

(3.11)

as far as the vector elds are concerned, their form in terms of the harmonic functions
introduced above is analogous to the one in the solution of [22] and we shall not give
it here. let us now move to the microscopic description of the above solution. this
will be easily obtained starting from the explicit expression of the n = 8 central charge
eigenvalues. comparing eq.s (3.3) and (3.5) one can see that the central charge eigenvalues
at spatial innity, when written in terms of the quantized charges, reads (in rigid indices):

z1 =

z2 =

z3 =

z4 =

(q0  p2  p3 + p1)
(q0 + p2  p3  p1)
(q0  p2 + p3  p1)
(q0 + p2 + p3 + p1)

(3.12)

according to the previous discussion, if the st u model is embedded in the full n = 8
theory as discussed in subsection 2.2, the microscopic description of the above solution can

13

be given in terms of the intersection of four bunches of parallel dbranes. in particular,
if we consider the type iia embedding dened in the same subsection, the central charge
z4 (which represents the n = 2 graviphoton dressed charge) and the matter charges
z ( = 1, 2, 3) are related to the gauge elds coming from the 10 dimensional rr
3form am n p (and its hodge dual) coupled to d2 (and d4)branes and from the rr
1form am (and its hodge dual) coupled to d0 (and d6)branes. our solution is hence
described, at the microscopic level, as a 1/8 supersymmetry preserving intersection of 4
bunches of these dbranes. the fact that each of the central charge eigenvalues is real or
pure imaginary (in our case they are all pure imaginary) implies that the solution is pure
electric, that is it is not made of electromagnetic dual objects.

let us be more precise and try to deduce the microscopic interpretation of our solution
from the algebraic framework consistently built in [15],[25] and in the present paper
(see the appendix). in appendix a of [25] the sp(8, ir) representation of the sl(2, ir)3
generators that we have been using for our study of the st u model is given. in particular,
the cartan generators have the form:

h1 =

h2 =

h3 =

1
2
1
2
1
2

diag (1,1, 1,1,1, 1,1, 1)
diag (1,1, 1, 1,1,1, 1, 1)
diag (1,1,1, 1,1, 1, 1,1)

(3.13)

if we interpret these cartan generators as corresponding (in the type iia framework) to
the roots 1 + 2, 3 + 4 and 5 + 6, so that we can interpret their diagonal values as the
scalar product of these roots with 8 weights w ()+
, the only set of weights on which all
the three generators are non singular as in (3.13) 6 is:

{w (1)+

, w (6)+

, w (7)+

, w (16)+

, w (29)+

, w (34)+

, w (35)+

, w (44)+

}

(3.14)

a possible correspondence is:

h3+4

h1+2

h1 = 1

h2 =

h3 = 1

6which is a general feature of the sp(8)d representation of sl(2, ir)3.

(3.15)

since our solution is charged only with respect to {q0, p1, p2, p3} from table 3 we may
read o the corresponding rr elds: a, a6789, a4589, a4567. the conguration of
microscopic objects coupled with these forms consists in 3 bunches of orthogonal d4
branes (n1 , n2 , n3, respectively) wrapped on the internal torus t 6 with n0 d0branes on
top of them. the d4branes are positioned in the following way: the above conguration

directions labeled with  are neumann while those labeled with  are dirichlet.
is 1/8 supersymmetric and adding any number of d0 branes the number of preserved
supersymmetries does not change, [28]. the previous analysis about the microscopic
interpretation of the vector elds suggests a precise relation between {q0, p1, p2, p3} and
{n0, n1, n2, n3} in the order. this relation can be easily derived by writing the expression
of the e7(7) quartic invariant, j4, as in [29]:

j4 = (|z1| + |z2| + |z3| + |z4|) (|z1|  |z2|  |z3| + |z4|) (|z1| + |z2|  |z3| + |z4|)
(3.16)

(|z1|  |z2| + |z3| + |z4|) + 8|z1||z2||z3||z4| (cos   1)
where, as well known, the entropy of the solution is s = j4.
in the case at hand
 = 0 mod 2 and the last term in the above equation drops out (according to the fact
that it is a four, rather than a ve parameters solution). the above expression reduces
to:

j4 = s0s1s2s3

(3.17)

where, using relations (3.12), it follows:

s0  (|z1| + |z2| + |z3| + |z4|) = 2q0
s1  (|z1|  |z2|  |z3| + |z4|) = 2p1
s2  (|z1| + |z2|  |z3| + |z4|) = 2p2
s3  (|z1|  |z2| + |z3| + |z4|) = 2p3

(3.18)

as noticed in [29], the charge vector basis we have chosen turns out to be the suitable
one for the microscopic identication, as for reading o the values of the integers n from

15

the relations (3.12). first notice that the 4 dimensional charge of a wrapped dpbrane is

qp = pvp/v6 where p = 2(2)3p is the normalized dpbrane charge density

in ten dimensions. provided the asymptotic values of the dilatons, which parameterize
the radii of the compactifying torus and which has been taken to be unitary, it turns
out that, in units where  = 1, the four dimensional quanta of charge for any kind of
(wrapped) dpbrane is equal to 2. on the contrary, our quantized charges (p, q) are
integer valued. the entropy formula (3.11) is reproduced microscopically by the above d
branes conguration, table 1, if we have precisely n0 = q0 , n1 = p1 , n2 = p2 , n3 = p3,
consistently with the result of our previous geometrical analysis. indeed the microscopic
entropy counting for this conguration has been performed in [30] and gives:

smicro = 2qn0n1n2n3

(3.19)

which exactly matches expression (3.11). from the conguration in table 1 one can
obtain, by various dualities, other four parameters solutions. for instance, t dualizing
on the whole t 6, one obtains a conguration made of n0 d6branes and 3 bunches of
(n1, n2, n3) d2branes localized in the planes (x4, x5), (x6, x7), (x8, x9) respectively.

4 discussion

the main aim of the present article was to dene in a precise mathematical fashion a
connection between the macroscopic analysis of 1/8 bps black hole solutions of n =
8, d = 4 supergravity carried out in [15, 17, 25, 26] and the microscopic description of
the subclass of these solutions carrying rr charge in terms of dbranes. to this end it
was necessary to single out in the uduality orbit of 1/8 bps black holes those charged
with respect to rr vector elds, once the n = 8 theory is interpreted as the lowenergy
limit of type ii superstring on t 6. the rst step in this direction was to describe group
theoretically the embedding of a class of st u models yielding the generating solution of
rr charged 1/8 bps black holes within the d = 4 maximal supergravity. to achieve this
we used the sla techniques developed in [19, 20] in order to characterize geometrically
the rr and the nsns ten dimensional origin of the elds in the n = 8, d = 4 theory.
we improved them in order to give, in this group theoretical framework, also two distinct
descriptions of the n = 8, d = 4 theory as deriving from type iia or type iib theories
in ten dimensions. a sla characterization of the eect of t duality transformations
on compact directions is also formulated in terms of the action of automorphisms of the
s  t duality group sl(2, ir)  so(6, 6) on the sla generating the scalar manifold of
the theory. besides characterizing the class of embeddings of the st u model describing

16

rr charged generating solutions, we dened a udual class of st u models describing
nsns charged solutions in the same mathematical fashion and the uduality relation
between the two classes of st u models can be inferred from their embedding in the larger
n = 8 theory (this transformation is in the automorphism group of u = e7(7) but not in
aut(s  t ) = aut(sl(2, ir)  so(6, 6)), since it does not preserve the rr and nsns
identities of the elds, while the models within each class are related by transformations
in aut(s  t ) ).

eventually we focused on two particular representatives of the rr class of st u
models and interpreted their elds in terms of ten dimensional type iia or type iib elds.
as an example a particular 4parameter solution of this model was considered and a
microscopic interpretation of it was given in terms dbranes (a conguration of d4 and
d0branes, in the framework of type iia theory).

the utility of the mathematical apparatus constructed in the present article (whose
details can be found in the appendix) is more general. indeed it allows to characterize
the bosonic sector of whatever model embedded in the n = 8, d = 4 theory in terms
of dimensionally reduced elds of type iia or iib theories, and therefore to interpret
microscopically (when it is possible) its solutions. moreover, a precise prescription is
given as to how to act on a particular truncation of the n = 8, d = 4 theory by means
of s  t duality (at the classical level). this method can be easily extended to describe
also uduality transformations, by considering the action of the whole aut(e7(7)) on the
model.

within the two t dual rr embeddings of the stu model discussed in subsection 2.2
it would be interesting to nd the generating solution in a form which is easily interpreted
in terms of bound states of dbranes, recovering as an example the two t dual micro-
scopic congurations described in [31]. one of these congurations consists of a system of
d4 and d0branes in type iia theory analogous to the one represented in table 1 but with
a magnetic ux switched on the world volume of one bunch of parallel d4 branes (which
would imply additional eective d2 and d0 charges,[32]). as already pointed out in the
introduction, this ux would correspond in the solution to the presence of nontrivial ax-
ions coming from the antisymmetric tensor (which would contribute to a non vanishing
real part of the central charges). an embedding where to look for this solution is the type
iia embedding described in subsection 2.2. the type iib conguration described in [31]
consists of 4 sets of d3 branes at angles and is obtained from the one described above
by a t duality along the internal directions x5,7,9 (these angles being related to the ux
in the dual conguration and consistent with the supersymmetry requirement,[28]). the
corresponding solution has to be looked for in the type iib embedding of section 2.2. in

17

the limits in which the magnetic ux is sent to zero or the system of d3 branes is set
to be orthogonal [33], one recovers the four parameter solution described in the previous
section (or its t dual).

once a generating solution is given then one can nd any other regular bps black
hole via uduality transformations. the importance of nding both a macroscopic and
miscoscopic description of the generating solution relies in the fact that it would allow to
have a precise control on both the macroscopic and microscopic structures of all regular
stringy black holes related by uduality transformations, and hence sharing the same
entropy. starting from a conguration for which a microscopic entropy counting is known
(as for instance pure dbranes congurations) one can then have an entropy prediction
and a description, both at macroscopic and microscopic levels, of those congurations for
which a microscopic entropy counting is out of present reach (as for example pure nsns
state congurations). this could help in revealing the underlined common properties of
very dierent black holes sharing the same entropy and hence giving some insights into
the basic properties of stringy oriented microscopic entropy counting.

although there exist in the literature some 5 parameter generating solutions, [34, 35,
26], the interpretation, at the microscopic level, of the parameters entering these solutions
is quite dicult, especially as far as the fth one is concerned. hence a simple and clear
description of the generating solution, both at macroscopic and microscopic level, is still
missing. the completion of this program is left to a future work.

a appendix: sla description of n = 8, d = 4 from type iia

and type iib theories and s, tdualities

sla of e7(7) and the scalar elds:
as already stated in section 2, in the sla representation of a theory, the scalar elds
are parameters of the solvable lie algebra generating the scalar manifold (in most super-
gravities at the classical level the scalar manifold can be described as a solvable group

18

manifold). the n = 8 theory in four dimensions can be interpreted as the low energy
limit of type iia or type iib theories on t 6. depending on the two interpretations we
shall give two dierent sla descriptions of the scalar manifold which is consistent with
the geometric characterization of t duality to be given in the sequel.

as anticipated in subsection 2.1 one may construct the e7(7) algebra in two ways,
depending on whether the d6 dynkin diagram consisting of the roots (i)i=1,...,6 in (2.6)
is extended by attaching the highest weight of the 32+ of so(6, 6) (+
7 ) to 5 or the
highest weight of the 32 (7 ) to 6. thus we obtain two e7(7) isomorphic algebras,
namely e7(7). as previously stated we parameterize with the scalars of the n = 8 theory
deriving from a dimensional reduction of type iia of type iib theory the sla of e +
7(7) and
e7(7) respectively.

the sla is generated by the noncompact cartan generators (in this case the whole
cartan subalgebra contributes to the sla) and the shift operators corresponding to roots
with positive restriction on the noncompact cartan generators.7 as far as the common
nsns sector is concerned, a suitable basis of noncompact cartan generators will be
parametrized by the radii of the torus and by the ten dimensional dilaton:

+ h27

6xi=1 ihi+ 72
5xi=1 ihi+ 72  6h6+ 72

+ h27

ck(iib) =

ck(iia) =

i =

1
2

ln(gi+3 i+3)

(a.1)

since this basis is not orthonormal, the overall coecient of h27 is the four dimensional
dilaton:

4 =  

1
2

6xi=1

i

(a.2)

the strange nonorthonormal basis in (a.1) is dened by the decomposition of the u
duality group in d dimensions with respect to the uduality group in d + 1 dimensions
for maximal supergravities [19]:

er+1(r+1)  o(1, 1)r + er(r) (r = 10  d)

(a.3)

7the criterion of positivity is dened for instance by xing an orthonormal basis of noncompact
cartan generators with a certain order and ordering the restrictions of the roots to this basis in a
lexicographic way: e.g. with respect to the system h1, h2 the root 1  2 is positive while with respect
to h2, h1 the root 2  1 is positive.

19

where er(r) is obtained by deleting the extreme root in the dynkin diagram of er+1(r+1) (on
the branch of 1, 2, . . .) and substituting it with the cartan generator o(1, 1)r orthogonal
to the rest of the dynkin diagram. these o(1, 1)r dene the basis in (a.1) and are
naturally parametrized by 7r.

as far as the the remaining nsns elds are concerned they parameterize the pos-
itive roots of sl(2, ir)  so(6, 6). according to the denition of the ordering relation
among the roots with respect to the orthonormal basis (hi), which determines the roots
contributing to the sla, one can have dierent equivalent slas, usually related by au-
tomorphisms of d6. it is natural to associate always the elds gij (i 6= j) with the roots
(i  j) and bij with the roots (i + j), since in the representation 12 of so(6, 6) in
which the generators have the form:

(m) 

  

 = 
 = diag(+ + + + + +     )
hi = mii+6



(a.4)

the shift operators corresponding to the former roots have a symmetric 6 6 odiagonal
block, while those corresponding to the latter roots have an antisymmetric odiagonal
block. using a lexicographic ordering with respect to the basis (hi) the roots contributing
to the sla and the corresponding scalar elds are listed in table 2.

finally the rr elds, as already pointed out, parameterize the shift operators corre-

sponding to the roots which are weights of the 32 of so(6, 6). these roots are:

32 :  = 

(1  2  3  4  5  6) +

(even number of + signs within brackets)

(a.5)

indeed the chirality operator  is easily computed in terms of the product of the cartan
generators (hi)i=1,...,6 in the spinorial representation ((s(hi))i=1,...,6):

{, } = 2

s(hi)  i, i+6 , (i, 1, . . . , 6)

 = 12    12 = s(h1)s(h2)    s(h6)

(a.6)

it is easy to check that  is positive on the + and negative on the . a precise
correspondence between the spinorial roots and scalar elds from type iia and type iib
theories is again given in table 2.

s, tduality:
we characterize the eect (at the classical level) of s and t duality on a theory, as far
as the scalar elds are concerned, as the action of transformations in aut(s  t ) on the
sla generating the scalar manifold. automorphisms of a semisimple lie algebra g are
isomorphisms of the algebra on itself and can be inner if their action can be expressed as a
conjugation of the algebra by means of a group element generated by the algebra itself, or
outer if they do not admit such a representation. it can be shown that the automorphism
group of g is isomorphic to the automorphism group of its root space and thus is a nite
group. the inner automorphisms are isomorphic to the group of weyl transformations
and the outer ones can be reduced to the symmetries of the dynkin diagram of g (modulo
weyl transformations). the action of an automorphism  on generators of g in the cartan
basis can be characterized in the following way:

 (h) = h () ;  (e) = e ()

, 

roots

(a.7)

in the case in which g = sl(2, ir)  so(6, 6) the outer automorphisms can be derived
(modulo weyl transformations) to the only symmetry transformation of d6, i.e. 5  6,
or equivalently 6  6. it can be shown in particular that transformations on the root
space amounting to a change of sign of an odd number of i are outer automorphisms.
since the automorphisms preserve algebraic structures, they will map solvable subalgebras
into solvable subalgebras. of course we do not expect automorphisms of s  t to be
automorphisms of e7(7) since the dynkin diagram of the latter does not have symmetries.
indeed it is easy to check that outer automorphisms of so(6, 6) map e7(7) into e7(7) (this
derives from the fact that changing sign to an odd number of i maps  into ).

we characterize algebraically a tduality transformation along a compact direction xk
(k = 4, . . . , 9) as the action of the outer automorphism k3  k3, and an sduality
transformation as the automorphism 7  7

let us consider as an example a t duality transformation along the direction x9 and
rst its eects on g99 (6) and the dilaton  starting from type iib elds. according to
the geometrical prescription given above:

(cid:18) 

6

2 (cid:19) h27  6h6 =   

6

2 ! h27  6h6

6 = 6  g99 = 1/g99
 =   6 =  
ln(g99)

1
2

(a.8)

where the primed elds are the corresponding type iia elds and the last equation is the

21

known transformation rule for the dilaton under t duality along a compact direction (in
the units  = 1). as far as the other elds are concerned, the action of this automorphism
is to map the roots 5  6 into 5  6 and thus the corresponding elds gi9  bi9 and
bi9  gi9:

gi9ei9 + bi9ei+9 = gi9ei+(9) + bi9ei(9) =

bi9ei+(9) + gi9ei(9)

(a.9)

the transformation on the rr elds, applying a similar rationale, can be read o table
2.

vector elds:

as far as the vector elds are concerned, we refer to the conventions of [15] in which the
8 of e7(7) was described in terms of 56 weights w ()
corresponding representation sp(56)d
( = 1, . . . , 56) , whose dierence from the highest weight w (51) are suitable combinations
of the simple roots with positive integer coecients (the rst 28 weights correspond to
magnetic charges, the last 28 to electric charges). in the conventions introduced in this
paper, depending on whether we consider e7(7) (type iia/iib) we have two set of weights
w (). these weights provide a suitable basis also for the two representations 28 and
28 in which the 56 decomposes with respect to su(8): the 28 is generated by w ()
with  = 1, . . . , 28 and the 28 by w (+28) = w (). we talk about representation 56
when we consider the quantized charges (p, q) and of representation 28 + 28 referring
to the dressed charges to be dened below. the weights w () can be naturally put in
correspondence with the vector elds obtained from the dimensional reduction of the
type iia or iib theory respectively. both the rst 28 magnetic charges and the last 28
electric charges decompose into a rst set of 16 rr charges (which contribute to a 32 of
so(6, 6)) and a second set of 12 nsns charges. representing these weights (as well as the
roots for the scalar elds in table 2) in the basis of (i)i=1,...,7 the correspondence weights 
vectors (or roots  scalars) becomes natural and consistent with our characterization of
s  t duality. indeed, as far as the rr elds are concerned, the natural correspondence
is between the inner indices of the dimensionally reduced form (which gives rise either
to a scalar or to a vector) and the number and positions of the + signs multiplying
the (i)i=1,...,6 in the corresponding weight.9
in tables 2 and 3 this correspondence has
been nailed down for a particular s  t duality gauge (so that the elds (weights) of
iib and iia are related by a t duality along the compact direction x9 (automorphism

8by sp(56)d we denote the 56 symplectic representation of e7(7) in which the cartan generators are

diagonal.

9for example the vector aijkl corresponds to the weight (1/2)(.. +i .. +j .. +k .. +l ..).

22

6  6)), making it possible to infer the transformation rules of the elds under a
generic s  t transformation.

we would like ultimately to be able to use table 3 in order to infer which kind of
dbrane charges characterize a particular solution and from it infer the particular super-
symmetric brane conguration which reproduces it (just as we have done for the relatively
simple example of the four parameter solution). table 3 has to be applied to the vector
in the 28 + 28 of su(8) consisting of the following dressed charges (i.e. the charges of the
branes coupled to the moduli of the internal torus 10, which are the eective microscopic
physical charges one could measure):

y()! = ilt()c  p
  x()
q!

(a.10)

where we have used the notation of [25]11:  is the point of the moduli space at radial
innity, il() is the coset representative of the scalar manifold (solvable group element)
in its sp(56)d representation, c is the symplectic invariant matrix and (p, q) are the
usual quantized charges (,  = 1, . . . , 28). the components of the vector (x(), y())
(expressed in the basis of the w ()) have to be interpreted in terms of the charges cor-
responding to the ten dimensional elds by applying table 3. in the example of the four
parameter solution the microscopic interpretation of eective dbrane charges was given
directly to the quantized charges {q0, p1, p2, p3} through the identication (3.15) since
the solution was dilatonic and the torus square (bi = 1). if axions were switched on
the correspondence between dressed and quantized charges would be less trivial (since
the coset representative would not be diagonal) and table 3 could give the microscopic
interpretation of the dressed charges only.

in the literature the vector of dressed charges (x(), y()) is also written in the fol-

lowing equivalent complex form:

xij() + iyij() = 

1

2(cid:16)ab(cid:17)ij

zab

(a.11)

is an so(8) rotation and the antisymmetric couple of indices (ij) run in

where (cid:16)ab(cid:17)ij

the 28 of so(8).

10in the general case also to the rr scalars.
11if the vector on the right hand side of (a.10) was projected on the young basis of the 28 + 28 of

su (8) we would have obtained on the left hand side the central charge vector (z ab, z ab) [15].
