abstract

one of the key properties of dirac operators is the possibility of a degeneracy of zero
modes. for the abelian dirac operator in three dimensions the question whether such
multiple zero modes may exist has remained unanswered until now. here we prove that
the feature of zero mode degeneracy indeed occurs for the abelian dirac operator in
three dimensions, by explicitly constructing a class of dirac operators together with their
multiple zero modes. further, we discuss some implications of our results, especially a
possible relation to the topological feature of hopf maps.

1 introduction

fermionic zero modes of the dirac operator da = (  ia) are of importance in
many places in quantum eld theory and mathematical physics [1, 2, 3]. they are the
ingredients for the computation of the index of the dirac operator and play a key role
in understanding anomalies. in abelian gauge theories, which is what we are concerned
with here, they aect crucially the behaviour of the fermion determinant det(da) in
quantum electrodynamics. the nature of the qed functional integral depends strongly
on the degeneracy of the bound zero modes.

in three dimensions  which is the case which we want to study here  the rst
examples of such zero energy fermion bound states have been obtained only in 1986 [4],
and some further results have been found recently [5]. in both articles no degeneracy of
these zero modes has been observed, because, by their very methods, the authors of [4]
and of [5] could only construct one zero mode per gauge eld. hence, the question of a
possible degeneracy of zero energy bound states of the abelian dirac operator in three
dimensions has remained completely unanswered up to now.

it should be emphasized here that the problem of the existence and degeneracy of zero
modes of the abelian dirac operator in three dimensions, in addition to being interesting
in its own right, has some deep physical implications. the authors of [4] were mainly
interested in these zero modes because in an accompanying paper [6] it was proven that
one-electron atoms with suciently high nuclear charge in an external magnetic eld are
unstable if such zero modes of the dirac operator exist.

further, there is an intimate connection between the existence and number of zero
modes of the dirac operator for strong magnetic elds on the one hand, and the non-
perturbative behaviour of the three dimensional fermionic determinant (for massive
fermions) in strong external magnetic elds on the other hand. the behaviour of this de-
terminant, in turn, is related to the paramagnetism of charged fermions, see [7, 8]. so, a
thorough understanding of the zero modes of the dirac operator is of utmost importance
for the understanding of some deep physical problems as well.

in addition, it is speculated in [8] that the existence and degeneracy of zero modes
for qed3 may have a topological origin as it does in qed2 [9][13]  cf. [8] for details
and an account of the situation for qed2,3,4.

it is the purpose of this letter to address the question of a possible degeneracy of zero
energy bound states of the abelian dirac operator in three dimensions. we shall prove
that the phenomenon of a degeneracy of zero modes does indeed occur, by constructing
a special class of gauge elds that lead to an arbitrary number of square-integrable zero
modes of the corresponding dirac operators. in addition, we shall discuss how our results
are related to some rigorous bounds on the number of zero modes, and we shall indicate
a possible relation of our results to some underlying topological properties of the special
class of gauge elds that we provide.

2 construction of the zero modes

we are interested in solutions of the three-dimensional, abelian dirac equation (the pauli
equation)

 iii(x) = ai(x)i(x).

(1)

here ~x = (x1, x2, x3)t, i, j, k = 1 . . . 3,  is a two-component, square-integrable spinor on
r3, i are the pauli matrices and ai is an abelian gauge eld. the authors of [4] observed
that a solution to this equation could be obtained from a solution to the simpler equation

 i~~ = h

(2)

for some scalar function h(x). in this case the corresponding gauge eld that obeys the
dirac equation (1) together with the spinor (2) is given by

ai = h

i


.

in addition, they gave the following explicit example

 = (1 + r2) 3

2 (1 + i~x~)0

where 0 is the constant unit spinor 0 = (1, 0)t. the spinor (4) obeys

 i~~ =

3

1 + r2 

and is, therefore, a zero mode for the gauge eld

~a =

3

1 + r2

~

(1 + r2)2

the magnetic eld ~b = ~  ~a for the gauge eld (6) reads

~b =

2x2x3 + 2x1

now assume that a function  exists such that

(ijj)(1 + i~x~)0 = 0

(3)

(4)

(6)

(7)

(8)

then n, n  z (where  is the zero mode (4)), are additional formal zero modes for
the same gauge eld (6). condition (8) implies

det(i~~) =

xi=1

,i,i = 0,

(9)

therefore,  necessarily must be complex. indeed, such a function  fullling (8) exists,

(11)

as may be checked easily. here we expressed  by its modulus s and phase  for later
convenience. for the formal zero modes n we observe the following two points. firstly,
n has to be integer, because only integer powers of  lead to a single-valued spinor n.
secondly, n is singular for all n  z \ {0}, because  is singular along the circle
{~x  r3 \ x3 = 0 , x2
2 = 1} and zero along the x3 axis. therefore, the formal zero
modes n, with  given in (4), are not acceptable. however, we shall nd some zero
modes, dierent from (4), where multiplication with n will lead to acceptable new zero
modes for some n 6= 0. for this purpose, let us rst review some more results of [4]. the
authors of [4] observed that, in addition to their simplest solution (4), they could nd
similar solutions to eq. (2) with higher angular momentum. using instead of the constant
spinor 0 = (1, 0)t the spinor

1 + x2

l,m = 


ql + m + 1/2 yl,m1/2
ql  m + 1/2 yl,m+1/2




(12)

(where m  [l  1/2 , l + 1/2] and y are spherical harmonics), they found the solutions

l,m = rl(1 + r2)l 3
~al,m = (2l + 3)(1 + r2)1 
l,m~l,m

.

(13)

(14)

specically, for maximal magnetic quantum number m = l + 1/2, these solutions read

l := l,l+1/2 =

~a(l) =

(16)

(17)

(where we have omitted an irrelevant constant factor in (15)). hence, l is proportional
to the simplest zero mode (4) and is, therefore, still an eigenvector of the matrix ijj

3

with eigenvalue zero. further, the zero mode l may be rewritten as (again, we ignore
irrelevant constant factors)

l = eil

sl

(1 + s2)l/2 (1 + r2)3/2(1 + i~x~)0

(18)

where we introduced polar coordinates (x1, x2, x3)  (r, , ), s is the modulus (11), and

yl,l = eil sinl  = eil (r2  x2
rl

3)l/2

= eil (1 + r2)l

rl

sl

(1 + s2)l/2 .

from expression (18) for l it follows easily that the spinors

n,l = nl = ei(ln)

sln

(1 + s2)l/2  , n = 0, . . . l

(19)

(20)

(where  is the spinor (4) and  is the phase (11)), are non-singular, square-integrable
zero modes for the same gauge eld ~a(l) and, therefore, the dirac operator with gauge
eld ~a(l) given by (16) has l + 1 square-integrable zero modes.

3 discussion

we explicitly constructed the gauge elds ~a(l), (16), and showed that the corresponding
dirac operator has l + 1 non-singular, square-integrable zero energy bound states (20).
hence we proved by explicit construction that the phenomenon of zero mode degeneracy
does occur for the abelian dirac operator in three dimensions, which has been unknown
until now.

before closing, we want to further comment on some points. firstly, the magnetic
elds (17) for higher l are just multiples of the simplest magnetic eld (7). therefore, the
number of zero modes nl for strong magnetic elds (i.e. large l) behaves like

nl = l + 1  cz d3x| ~b(l)|

(21)

(it holds that lim|~x| | ~b(l)|  r4, therefore the integral in (21) exists), i.e., nl grows
linearly with the strength of the magnetic eld (here c is some constant). this is well
within the rigorous upper bound on the possible growth of the number of zero modes

n  c z d3x| ~b|3/2

(22)

that was rst stated in [4] and later derived in [8] (here c is a constant).

secondly, there is in fact a relation between our magnetic elds (17) and the topo-
logical feature of hopf maps. hopf maps are maps s3  s2, and they fall into distinct
homotopy classes that are labelled by the integers (the hopf index). hopf maps may be
represented by complex functions  : r3  c provided that (|~x| = ) = 0 = const.

4

here the coordinates in r3 and c are interpreted as stereographic coordinates of the s3
and s2, respectively. further, a magnetic eld ~b (the hopf curvature) is related to each
hopf map, where ~b is tangent to the closed curves  = const, see [14][17] for details.

the observation which we want to make here is that the function  in (10) is just
the simplest standard hopf map with hopf index 1, and the magnetic eld (7) is related
to the corresponding hopf curvature of . more precisely, after the addition of a xed
prescribed background magnetic eld, the magnetic eld (7) is precisely equal to the hopf
curvature of the simplest hopf map  (see [17]). further, as the higher ~b(l) are related
to the simplest ~b by integer coecients, (17), they are related to the hopf curvatures of
higher hopf maps in the same way (i.e., they are equal to higher hopf curvatures after
the addition of the same xed background magnetic eld). the corresponding hopf index
hl may be expressed by the number of zero modes nl as

hl = ((nl + 1)/2)2

(23)

(when the conventions of [17] for the hopf curvature are used). eq. (23) will be proved
and discussed in more detail elsewhere, [18]. as l is related to the angular momentum,
(13), this indicates an interesting connection between angular momentum, the number of
zero modes and the hopf index.

the above observation leads, of course, to the question whether the topological feature
of hopf maps is related to the existence and degeneracy of zero modes in the general case.
this question will be investigated further in future publications. here we just want to
mention that there exist more zero modes that are proportional the simplest zero mode (4)
up to a scalar function, see e.g. [17]. for these zero modes it remains true that additional
formal zero modes of the same dirac operator may be constructed by multiplication with
the complex function , as we did above. in addition, the number of square-integrable
zero modes remains related to the hopf index of the corresponding magnetic eld (when
interpreted as a hopf curvature) as in (23), [18].

anyhow, we think that our results will be relevant for some future developments in
mathematical physics, as well as for the understanding of non-perturbative aspects of
quantum electrodynamics, especially in three dimensions.
