abstract pure spinor formalism and non-integrable exponential factors are used for con-
structing the conformal-invariant wave equation and lagrangian density for massive fermion.
it is proved that canonical dirac lagrangian for massive fermion is invariant under induced
projective conformal transformations.

i. introduction

it was proved in 1910 by bateman and cunningham[1] that the maxwell equations of
electromagnetic eld are invariant under conformal transformations in ordinary spacetime.
in 1928 paul dirac discovered the relativistic-invariant wave equation of electron. and af-
ter several years in 1936 he studied the possibility of getting a wave equation in conformal
space corresponding to ordinary wave equation for electron.[2] in this paper we re-examine
the above problem by means of cartans[3] pure spinor formalism. one knows that conformal
transformations in ordinary spacetime can be realized as a group of linear so(2, 4) rotation
transformations in a six-dimensional pseudo-euclidean space r(2,4). the spinor representa-
tion in r(2,4) exists because the cliord algebra exists. thus we obtain eight spin- 1
2 states
rather than the four obtained from the usual dirac equation. the physical four-dimensional
spacetime manifold is a hypersphere or a null-cone in an abstract r(2,4). according to
dirac,[2] only the values of the functions expressed on the four-dimensional hypersphere
represent physical entities. and we conjecture that only pure spinors associated with the
given isotropic two-plane in r(2,4) and the null-geodesic in four-dimensional spacetime have
physical signicance. using the conformal-invariant purity-constraint, we can write the la-
grangian for fermion in the same form as that for boson, which is unchanged under conformal
rescaling. the mass of fermion was introduced by the method of introducing the non-integrable
exponential factor in the fermion. one can realize that the mass term has a close relation
with triality in the fermion. we can prove that the usual canonical lagrangian for massive
fermion is invariant under induced projective conformal transformations. finally we give the
explicit form of these transformations and the associated noethers conserved currents.

ii. conformal group

conformal transformations c(1, 3) are those (nonlinear) transformations of the points of

(compactied) minkowski space x  x = x(x) which satisfy the set of equations

where |  x
x| is the jacobian of the transformations. it is the group of transformations which
leaves the equation of line element d s2 = 0 invariant. conformal mappings include the

which are a four-parameter set since the choice of origin is arbitrary. a special conformal
transformation is an inversion, followed by a spacetime translation followed by an inversion

these conformal transformations can be realized as a group of linear transformations in a six-
dimensional pseudo-euclidean space r(2,4). a clue to this is obtained by noticing that the lie
algebra of c(1, 3) is isomorphic to that of the group so(2, 4). introducing pseudo-euclidean
coordinates ya (indices a, b, = (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) = (, 5, 6)). the dierential operators mab
representing the generators of the so(2, 4) are

mab = i(cid:16)ya

ya(cid:17).

(4)

we shall now realize the conformal compactication m c

4 of the minkowski space m4 =
r(1,3) as a four-dimensional submanifold (with boundary) of r(2,4). consider the con c
dened as the set of points in r(2,4) satisfying

abyayb = 0 ,

(5)
where ab = diag (+1,1,1,1,1, +1) is a pseudo-euclidean metric. elements of m c
(i.e., equivalence classes of points of c) can be divided into two disjoint subsets.
let m = {y  c, y5 + y6 6= 0}. we shall identify m with the minkowski space m4 and the
4 representation points at innity. let

4 with y5 + y6 = 0 as the boundary of m c

subset of m c
us introduce the special coordinates on m

x =

y5 + y6 .

(6)

then the generators (which act on the hyperquadric c) of the conformal group c(1, 3) can
be dened as

strictly speaking it is a restricted conformal group, that is, the subgroup of mappings con-
nected with the identity map. this does not include the actual inversion mapping but does
include their products with space reections (special conformal transformation). the inversion
x  x = x(x x )1 in m c
to introduce spinors into our conformal space, we factorize the fundamental quadratic
form yaabyb that denes the space r(2,4). the spinor representation in r(2,4) exists because
the cliord algebra exists. the cliord algebra associated with so(2, 4) consists of six 8  8
matrices a which satisfy

the matrices l

dierent rotations in the ab plane. the group thus has two pieces s = (1 + i abl

c1(1, 3) and s+ = (1 + i abl+
ab)  c2(1, 3). they are topologically disjunct (disjoint), and
there is no continuous path from one piece to the other. on the analogy of eq. (7) the above

so we can dene two types of four-parameter complex semi-spinors  and  besides two

(20)

where  = y5 + y6. so the volume element g (d4 x) = 4(d4 x) is the conformal scalar of

degree four. for simplicity we consider here the case with a conformal at metric only.

a physical theory will be called conformally invariant if it is possible to attach conformal
weights (or degree) to all the quantities appearing in the theory in such a way that all eld
equations are preserved under conformal rescaling. in physics we consider functions of position
that can represent physical entities, such as eld quantities or wave functions. they are, of
course, only the functions of position in the conformal minkowski spacetime m c
4 .[2] in the next
section we will introduce conformal spinors of degree n = 1, i.e.,  = (y5 + y6)n(x) and
 = (y5 + y6)n(x). where the physical entities (x) and (x) are only functions of x.

iii. pure spinor

spinors were rst used under such a name by physicists in the eld of quantum mechan-
ics.
in most of their general mathematical forms, spinors were discovered in 1913 by elie
cartan.[4] for a long time, the interest of physicists in spinors was restricted to three- and

no. 4

pure spinor formalism for conformal fermion and conserved currents485

four-dimensional spaces (euclidean and minkowski). spinors associated with them have two
or four components. recent work on fundamental interactions and their unication makes
essential use of geometries of more than four dimensions. for this reason, spinor structure in
higher dimensions and, in particular, elie cartans pure (or simple) spinors, now have more
chance to relate to physics[5,6] than they had at the time of the appearance of e. cartans
lectures.[3]

we start by schematically reminding some of the main denitions and properties of pure
spinors[3,5,6] associated with a space v of dimensions d = 6 with scalar product g. let
cl(g) represent the cliord algebra associated with v , then a spinor is dened as an eight-
dimensional vector of the complex spinor space s where cl(g) admits a faithful and irreducible
representation.
if 1, 2, , 6 represent an orthonormal basis of v , their elements a
(a = 1, 2, , 6) may be thought as generators of cl(g) with the property

(21)
let   s be a complex eight-dimensional spinor and y  v be a vector (it may be thought
of the form y = yaa) satisfying the equation

ab + ba = 2ab .

(22)
then for  6= 0, the fundamental quadratic form of v is g(y, y) = 0. therefore we may dene
m (),

y =yaa = 0 .

m () = {y  v | yaa = 0} ,

(23)

it is easily seen that m () is

as the subspace of v associated with (the direction of) .
totally null, since from y, z  m () follows g(y, z) = 0. we have now:

denition a spinor  is said to be pure (simple) if m () is a maximal and totally null

subspace of v .

in our case v is real six-dimensional, the corresponding pure spinor then denes a 2-plane

which must be isotropic (i.e., totally null). there is cartans general theorem:[3]

theorem any isotropic -plane can be dened in terms of a pure spinor. the set of pure

spinors is left invariant by rotations and reversals.

there are two types of pure spinors, they can be rewritten in the following dierent but

equivalent forms (n  will be dened in eq. (27))

ax2(cid:17)0 = exph x

we can verify that the eigenspinors of casimir operators (19) are pure! we see that the
above representations of pure spinors in terms of components are given for a particular choice
of origin and coordinates. to avoid introducing singularities in the coordinate system, it is
convenient to use the rst forms of the above pure spinors. in the next section we will use these
forms. the second forms are useful for observer at innity, here 0 = ax i [(1  5)/2]l0
and 0 = ax i [(1 + 5)/2]r0. in the third forms l01 +(x/ax2) i [(1 + 5)/2]02 = l0.
the ya in the last abstract forms takes the value only on the spacetime hypersphere, and it
is not dependent upon the arbitrary choice of origin and coordinates. we can verify that

 = rr = r = r =  = 0 .

for the study of our pure spinors it is useful to construct a null basis. let

 = ll = l = l =  = 0 ,
(cid:17)i(cid:16) 1  5
n (a) h1  ax i (cid:16) 1  5
are idempotent projective operators. they can be considered as generalization of ordinary
(1  5)/2 and (1 + 5)/2. we can prove that

(cid:17) = exphax i (cid:16) 1  5

(cid:17)i(cid:16) 1  5

n (a)n (a) = n (a) ,

ax2(cid:17)n (a) = n (a) ,

n +(cid:16) 1
ax2(cid:17)n +(cid:16) 1
n (a)n +(cid:16) 1

ax2(cid:17) = n +(cid:16) 1
ax2(cid:17) ,
ax2(cid:17) = n +(cid:16) 1
ax2(cid:17) .

thus they constitute the algebra of primitive spinorial idempotents and completely determine
the structure of the cliord algebra and the null basis of the pure spinors.

in fact the pure spinors

are the null twistors (in four-dimensional spacetime) which were studied early by penrose.[7]
they can be considered as generalization of conventional l0 = [(1  5)/2](x) and r0 =
[(1 + 5)/2](x). the geometry of these spinors is clearest in the terms of projective twistor
space. considering  to be xed and solving for real solutions x  m of equation  =
n (a)l0, it turns out that a solution exists only if  = 0. these solutions x( ) (for xed
) in real minkowski space m constitute a null straight line (null geodesics with parameter
 ), and every null straight line in minkowski space arises in this way. so a point in minkowski
space is said to be incident with the null twistor. this is the so-called standard at-space
twistor correspondence.

by

the induced transformations of l0  l0 = s

we see, our pure spinors (24) and (25) admit a unique decomposition of null twistors, each
of them denes an isotropic two-plane in six-dimensional space v and a null geodesic (with
parameter  ) in physical four-dimensional spacetime. in other words, for every pure spinor
there are two undetermined parameters in v space, i.e.,  = y5 + y6 and  .

the most important is although s 6= s+ in eq. (13), but after projection we get s

where  = (  ). the operators of the rst set act on l0 and r0 while operators of
the second set act on 0 and 0. two sets of the above operators satisfy the same commutation
relations of conformal lie algebra.

thus, our theory predicts the existence of two kinds of left-handed fermions (l0 and 0)
and two kinds of right-handed fermions (r0 and 0). they have dierent intrinsic energy-
momentum. for observer at innity, k 
 and k will play a role of the energy-momentum. it
is easy to see if we replace coordinate x by z = x/x2. incidentally, one can consider this
as a coordinate change rather than a point transformation.

iv. conformal-invariant dynamical system

a well-known characteristic of weak interactions is that they violate parity conservation to
a maximal degree by virtue of the va coupling. that is, only the left-handed components of
leptons are coupled in the charge-changing sector; the right-handed components play a rather
passive role  to provide mass. similarly, hadronic weak interactions can be accounted for
by assuming that quarks have the same kind of weak couplings. thus, the elementary entities
are states of denite chirality, which have zero bare mass. an eigenstate of nite mass is a
superposition of left- and right-handed states with equal weights. this is a very important
fact theoretically, because it is the basis for our theoretical understanding of why quarks and
leptons are very light compared with the mass scale of grand unication or the planck mass.
the unied gauge theory of electroweak interaction based on a gauge group su(2) u(1),
which mixes dierent massless chiral states. we see that in the standard weinbergsalam
model, the left-handed and right-handed fermions are treated on dierent levels. all left-
handed components are supposed to form su(2) doublets while the right-handed components
are su(2) singlets. this means that from mathematical point of view the left-handed fermion
and the right-handed fermion are completely dierent quantities and have dierent trans-
formation properties. we will extend this idea to the case with conformal transformations.
in our opinion, there is no reason not to require that under conformal transformations
the left-handed and right-handed fermions transform in dierent ways! we can
easily visualize this situation by the example of two dierent kinds of screws. when we screw
both, the clockwise (right-handed) and counterclockwise(left-handed) screws, in the same ro-
tation direction, we can observe that if the former is screwed (translated) in, the latter will
be screwed (translated) out.

vol. 31

generally, the concepts of ordinary left-handed fermion l0  [(1  5)/2] and right-
handed fermion r0  [(1 + 5)/2] are not conformal-invariant. for this, the pure spinors (or
the null-twistors) can be introduced for generalization of conventional l0 and r0.

as mentioned in the previous section, in a special coordinate system, the pure spinors 
and  take the form of eqs (24) and (25) or eq. (29). after the redenition of l0 and r0
they can be rewritten in the following null twistor form

the additional exponential exp[ir ea d x] is familiar to us in the theory of the non-integrable

phase factor. the connection between non-integrability of phase and the electromagnetic eld
given in this section is not new, which is essentially just weyls principle of gauge invariance
in its modern form.[8] it is also contained in the work of ivanenko and fock,[9] who considered
a more general kind of non-integrability based on a general theory of parallel displacement of
half-vectors. the non-integrable phases for the wavefunctions were also discussed by dirac[10]
in 1931, where the problem of monopole was studied. c.n. yang[11] reformulated the concept of
a gauge eld in an integral formalism. according to weyl and yang, the eect of a potential
a is to introduce a non-integrable phase in the wavefunction  of potential-free particle.
incidentally, following dirac[2] we assume that electromagnetic potential a is a conformal
vector of degree 1.
the exponential exp{ax i [(1  5)/2]} = {1  ax i [(1  5)/2]} rst appeared
in the redened wavefunction of electron in the work of dirac,[2] where the wave equation in
conformal space was studied. this exponential was also used in the denition of null twistor
by penrose[7] and in ref. [12].

the exponential exp [i mr h 

 must mix
dierent chiral states l0 and r0. one knows that a charged particle must be massive. thus
in our model the mass m was introduced in the similar way as the charge e. we give some

kr0 = l0 and kl0 = r0. we thus see that there is a curious additional symmetry
referred to as a principle of triality[3,5,7] with three types of objects: complex vector k,
semi-spinors r0 and l0. the most important for us is that if 0 = r0 + l0 satises massless

the simplest rst order conformally invariant wave equation in six-dimensional space is
i aa = w  i (  i ea + i mh 
i aa = w + i (  i ea + i mh +

here w  = [(y5 + y6)3/aa ]n (a) exp (i mh ) and degree n = 2. we realize that

the last form of the above equation is equivalent to the usual dirac equation for electron in
four-dimensional spacetime, and its conformal invariance is by no means apparent, but due to

pure spinor formalism for conformal fermion and conserved currents489

its equivalence to the rst form, it of course must also have this invariant property.

sometimes it is prefer to use the lagrangian formalism as a starting point in constructing
various quantum eld theories. the point of lagrangian formalism is that it makes it easy to
satisfy conformal invariance and especially to obtain noethers conserved currents.

one knows that the equations of motion follow from a principle of least action. the action

i =z lg(d4 x)

(41)

must be unchanged under conformal rescaling.
in other words the action must be a
conformal scalar of degree zero, i.e., it must be independent of  = (y5 + y6). since

g (d4 x) = 4(d4 x) is conformal scalar of degree 4, the lagrangian density l( , ) must
be a conformal scalar of degree 4. for this, physical elds must be the conformal elds of
degree n = 1.

the simplest or most economical conformal-invariant lagrangian for fermion in pure

spinors form is (here we take a = 0 for simplicity)

in general cases the induced projective transformations of r0 and l0 are very complicated,

so for simplicity we will consider another special choice of h  here. let  = r0 + l0, and



h  =z (cid:16)

we want to point out that h +

h  does not change the canonical diracs lagrangian density (42) for massive fermion. the

finally we come to the conclusion that the usual canonical action of massive fermion is

invariant under (above) induced transformations of conformal group.

there are four conserved noethers currents associated with the above induced confor-
