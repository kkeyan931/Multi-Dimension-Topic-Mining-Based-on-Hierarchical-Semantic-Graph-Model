(1) (2) note, (p + 1) (p + 1) matrix assumed invertible. let us show conguration d-instantons equivalent dp-brane. order show two dierent congurations d-branes equivalent, one prove open string theory corresponding congurations equivalent. quick way see equivalence look boundary states. boundary state |bi corresponding conguration eq.(1) written follows: |bi = trpeir 2 0 dpi p |bi1. (3) pi() variable conjugate string coordinate xi() equal 1 2 xi |bi1 denotes boundary state d-instanton usual background. origin satises xi()|bi1 = 0. |bi1 includes also ghost part relevant discussion here. factor front |bi1 analogue wilson loop corresponds background eq.(1). eq.(3) rewritten using path integral |bi = z e 2 r dp ip jij ir dpip |bi1, (4) ij = (1)ij. straightforward perform path integral eq.(4). using fock space representation |bi1, path integral gaussian. determinant factor regularized usual way {$9711162$}, one show |bi coincides boundary state dp-brane u(1) gauge eld strength fij = ij worldvolume. knowing path integration gaussian, easy conrm fact. indeed, one show following identity holds: 0 = z  p i() e 2 r dp ip jij ir dpip |bi1 = |bi. (5) 2construction dp-branes d(p 2r)-branes done torus {$9510135$}. things discussed partially generalized space compactied torus {$9711162$}. 3 therefore |bi coincide exp|bip normalization. |bip denotes boundary state dp-brane satisfying pi()|bip = 0. hence |bi equivalent boundary state dp-brane u(1) gauge eld strength fij = ij worldvolume. analysis using path integral expression eq.(4), overall normal- ization boundary state ambiguous. actually one prove equivalence including normalization showing open string theory corresponding conguration eq.(1) equivalent one corresponding dp-brane. refer {$9711162$} details. easy supersymmetrize arguments. nsr formalism boundary state d-instanton written sum four states |b; i1,i = n s, r indicates sector belongs xm ()|b; i1,i = 0, (m () ())|b; i1,i = 0. supersymmetric generalization eq.(4) given |b; i1,i |b; ii = z e 1 2 r d(ip ip j+ij)ij r d(ipip iii)|b; i1,i , (6) (7) 2(m () ()). show following arguments () = 1 boundary state coincides boundary state dp-brane normalization. also possible prove equivalence open string theories {$9711162$}. since arguments section essentially variables xi, (i = 1, , p + 1) worldsheet, quite straightforward apply arguments prove dp-brane expressed conguration innitely many d(p2r)-branes. also easy generalize argument case n dp-branes. case consider block diagonal background x = p , (8) n n identity matrix element u(n) lie algebra. expression boundary state eq.(4) modied |bi = z trpe 2 r dp ip jij ir dpip |bi1, (9) trp means trace path-ordered product respect u(n) indices. easy see conguration corresponds n dp-branes following arguments above. 4 3 worldvolume theory previous section, explained open string theory corresponding conguration d-instantons eq.(1) equivalent one dp-brane f = . means worldvolume theory one dp-brane also described worldvolume theory d-instantons. section, investigate worldvol- ume theory two dierent points view, i.e. either worldvolume theory one dp-brane d-instantons. call dp-brane picture d-instanton picture respectively. show two related other. argument section done bosonic string case simplicity. superstring case, similar results derived starting expression eq.(7). argument section applied study worldvolume theory dp-branes regarding worldvolume theory innitely many d(p 2r)- branes 2r < p + 1. also straightforward deal case number dp-brane one. comment generalizations end section. 3.1 dp-brane picture let us start following expression boundary state dp-brane: |bi = z e 2 r dp ip jij ir dpip |bi1. (10) corresponds dp-brane longitudinal xi (i = 1, , p + 1) directions u(1) gauge eld strength f = . worldvolume theory dp-brane consists gauge eld ai scalar elds (m = p + 2, , d). correspond shape worldvolume expressed equation xm = (x1, , xp+1). considering eld congurations static gauge, coordinates worldvolume taken x1, , xp+1. boundary state corresponding conguration ai, easily guessed |bi = z  exp|bi1. (11) indeed coincides eq.(10) f = , = 0. small deformations ai, background f = , = 0, expect boundary state |bi eq.(10) modied vertex operator (1 + iz d(ai(x)xi (x)pm ))z e 2 r dp ip jij ir dpip |bi1, (12) consistent eq.(11). moreover since xm ()|bi1 = 0, boundary state exactly describes emission closed string worldvolume xm = 5 (x1, , xp+1). contribution gauge eld form wilson loop. state brs invariant ai, satisfying equations motion. qb|bi = 0 implies path integral measure invariant reparametrization (). imposing condition, one may able deduce equations motion calculations similar {$9711162$}. thus picture, worldvolume theory u(1) gauge theory scalars . note, always assume pauli-villars regularization worldsheet taken noncommutativity regularization discussed {$9510135$} occur. 3.2 d-instanton picture let us consider worldvolume theory worldvolume theory d-instantons. boundary state eq.(10) corresponds conguration eq.(1) d-instantons. general conguration d-instantons described x = ( p ) (m = 1, , d), (13) one assumes operators p (i = 1, , p) generate possible operators acting chan-paton indices d-instantons. dening functions , need specify ordering operators p i, given shortly. form boundary state corresponding conguration eq.(13)? natural guess |bi = z e 2 r dp ip jij ir dpm (p )|bi1. (14) small deformations background eq.(1), expect boundary state eq.(10) modied z (1 iz dm (p )pm )e 2 r dp ip jij ir dpip |bi1. (15) since vertex operators corresponding transverse deformations (m = p + 2, , d) coincides eq.(12), expect transverse appear way eq.(11). eq.(14) unique choice satisfying condition d-dimensional rotational invariance. boundary state eq.(14) describes emission closed string hypersurface x = (p ). therefore elds (p ) correspond shape d-branes p play role coordinates p-brane. order consistent path integral form eq.(14), ordering eq.(13) chosen weyl-ordering{$9711162$}. explicit, c-number function f (p ), let us dene weyl-ordered function f ( p ) f ( p ) = z dp+1keiki p f (k), (16) 6 f (k) = z dp+1p (2)p+1 eikip f (p ). (17) ( p ) right hand side eq.(13) understood weyl- ordered function corresponding c-number function (p ) eq.(14). action physical quantities worldvolume theory d-instantons written trace function weyl-ordered operators eq.(16). however convenient us rewrite everything terms c-number functions (p ) eq.(17). using following formula{$9711162$}: r(f1( p )f2( p ) fn( p )) = z dp+1p (2)(p+1)/2q|det| -product dened f1(p ) f2(p ) fn(p ). (18) f (p ) g(p ) = e 2 ij j f (p + )g(p + )|==0. (19) hence, trace function weyl-ordered operators rewritten terms corresponding c-number functions replacing product operators -product corresponding c-number functions trace integral. thus one regards worldvolume theory theory d-instantons, de- scription noncommutative. p considered coordinates p-brane noncommutative -product reecting commuta- tion relation eq.(2). let us discuss kind theory noncommutative eld theory is. lagrangian worldvolume theory d-instantons written terms commutators matrices ( p ). since started back- ground eq.(1), let us express (i = 1, , p + 1) form background uctuations around it: (20) c-number expression corresponding commutators i( p ) easily calcu- lated i( p ) = p + ijaj( p ).  iij i(f )ij, (21) (22) fij = iaj(p ) jai(p ) iai aj(p ) + iaj ai(p ). fij considered eld strength noncommutative yang-mills eld ai. i( p ) essentially corresponds covariant derivative + ia. thus commutators elds give covariant derivative elds. commutators interpreted gauge covariant commutators noncommutative yang- mills theory. since lagrangian written terms commutators, noncommutative theory considered noncommutative yang-mills theory {$9711162$}. gauge invariance theory stems transformation ( p ) = i. (23) 7 theory d-instantons u() transformation theory invariant. c-number formulation transformation corresponds coordinate transformation p = ijj(p ). (24) coordinate transformation preserves = 1. one regards symplectic form, transformations canonical transformations. invariance canonical transformation discussed next subsection. 3.3 relation two pictures previous subsections obtain two points view worldvolume theory. since supposed describe thing, correspondence two. dp-brane picture, worldvolume elds gauge eld ai (i = 1, , p + 1) scalars (m = p + 2, , d), coordinates worldvolume taken xi (i = 1, , p + 1). hand, worldvolume elds d-instanton picture (p ) (m = 1, , d) p coordinates worldvolume. noticed previous section, elds (m = p + 2, , d) common correspond other. therefore nd elds ai related. let us rst consider small deformations ai, background eq.(1). eq.(12), one see ai changes boundary state |bi = iz z dai(p )p ie 2 r dp ip jij ir dpip |bi1, compared variation corresponding eq.(15): |bi = iz z di(p )pie 2 r dp ip jij ir dpip |bi1. (25) (26) relation two variations derived following identity 0 = z  p i() e 2 r dp ip j ij ir dpip |bi1 = z e 2 r dp ip jij ir dpip |bi1, (27) implies |bi eqs.(25)(26) coincide ai = ijj. relation given {$9711162$}. order see relation two pictures nite deformations, convenient way consider description involving elds ai (m = 1, , d). eqs.(11)(14), boundary state involving elds |bi = z eir dai(p )p iir dpm (p )|bi1. (28) 8 however two many elds description symmetry reduce number them. boundary state eq.(28) invariant gauge transformation ai = i. moreover, dp-brane picture, considering ai means considering theory gauge xing reparametrization invariance. therefore theory reparametrization invariance. indeed argue boundary state eq.(28) invariant following transformation ai(p ) = j(p )fji(p ), (p ) = i(p )im (p ), (29) variation proportional sum equations motion p i. transformation coincides coordinate transformation eld-dependent gauge transformation ai(p ) = j jai ijaj + i(jaj). (30) since boundary state eq.(28) gauge invariant, reparametrization invariant. therefore description involving ai (m = 1, , d) invariant reparametrization worldvolume. dp-brane picture obviously corre- sponds static gauge. hand, one see eq.(14) d-instanton picture apparently corresponds gauge fij = ij. sure gauge taken arbitrary conguration gauge eld f , least thinking uctuation background f = perturbatively, seems right. gauge x whole reparametrization invariance worldvolume. residual invariance consists coordinate transformation preserving ij, i.e. canonical transformation. saw invariance c-number counterpart u() invariance previous subsection. since dierence gauge choice, give explicit relation static gauge variables ai(x), st (x) (m = p + 2, , d) variables nc(p ) (m = 1, , d) 3 noncommutative description least classically, i.e. small ,: nc(p ) = st (1 nc(p ), , p+1 nc (p )) (m = p + 2, , d), ij = fkl(1 nc(p ), , p+1 nc (p )) k nc p l nc p j . (31) (32) eq.(32) rewritten terms noncommutative yang-mills eld ai using eq.(20) (1)ij = (m f (p + a)m)ij , j = j + ikjak(p ). (33) (34) 3here subscript st nc distinguishing dierent gauges. 9 gives explicit relation commutative gauge eld ai(x) noncommu- tative gauge eld ai(p ). let us comment two generalizations results section. first one consider one dp-branes. starting background eq.(8), follow arguments n = 1 case. time elds ai adjoint representation u(n). put trp front right hand sides eqs.(10),(11),(14),(28) follow arguments n = 1 case. reparametrization invariance boundary state case derived follows. path-ordered trace version eq.(28) rewritten introducing fermions fundamental representation u(n) |bi = z  exp|bi1. (35) ta generators u(n) fundamental representation. form, see boundary state invariant transformation ai(p ) = j(p )fji(p ), (p ) = i(p )dim (p ), (36) variation proportional equations motion p i, . trans- formation equivalent coordinate transformation eld-dependent gauge transformation. moreover argue boundary state invariant ai(p ) = j(p )tafji(p ), (p ) = i(p )taim (p ), (37) variation proportional lim ta() (equations motion)(). transformation considered nonabelian generalization coordinate transformation eld-dependent gauge transformation. fixing invariance taking static gauge f = get commutative noncommutative descriptions respectively. secondly also possible study worldvolume theory dp-branes regarding worldvolume theory innitely many d(p 2r)-branes. obtain descrip- tion coordinates worldvolume become noncommutative. 4 discussions note, shown dp-branes constant eld strength fij represented conguration innitely many d(p 2r)-branes. worldvolume theory dp-branes analysed regarding worldvolume theory d(p 2r)-branes obtain noncommutative description worldvolume 10 theory. system studied gauge equivalent one studied {$9510135$}. paper, d-branes constant bij background considered authors get commutative noncommutative descriptions worldvolume theory depending regularization. moreover propose descriptions continuously varying connect commutative noncommutative descriptions. actually realize descriptions also formalism considering system constant bij background {$9610043$}. therefore suspect noncommutative description equivalent choice {$9510135$}. since explicit relation commutative noncommutative descriptions valid small , may interesting compare relation theirs. comment one crucial dierence. {$9510135$}, gauge transformations commutative noncommutative descriptions related relation obtained gauge invariance non- commutative theory residual reparametrization invariance related commutative gauge invariance. therefore relation obtained eq.(32) gauge invariant quantities. since example relation commutative noncommutative theory, may generalized used studying non- commutative theories. one example noncommutative geometric formulation open string eld theory{$9510135$}. think relation studied note may relevant revealing symmetries hidden string eld theory. hope come back problem future. acknowledgements would like thank organizers workshop wonderful workshop. grateful h. aoki, s. iso, h. kawai, y. kitazawa t. tada collaborations k. okuyama discussions. work supported grant-in-aid scientic research ministry education, science culture japan.
