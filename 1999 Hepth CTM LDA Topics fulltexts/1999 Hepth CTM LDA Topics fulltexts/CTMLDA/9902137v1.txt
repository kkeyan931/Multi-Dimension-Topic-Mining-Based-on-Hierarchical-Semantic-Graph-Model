abstract

the requirement that the action be stationary for solutions of the
dirac equations in anti-de sitter space with a denite asymptotic be-
haviour is shown to x the boundary term (with its coecient) that
must be added to the standard dirac action in the ads/cft corre-
spondence for spinor elds.

1 introduction

the stationary phase method enables one to give an asymptotic ex-
pansion for the path integral

z = z [d] exp

(1.1)

of a quantum system in the classical limit h  0. one nds to leading
order (and dropping the prefactors)

(1.2)

where scl is the value of the action functional s[] evaluated on the
classical history, i.e., on the solution of the classical equations of mo-
tion

s
i = 0
fullling the given boundary conditions.

(1.3)

it is quite crucial in order for (1.2) to be correct that the action
s[] be indeed stationary on the classical path. this rather trivial
observation has far-reaching consequences on spaces with boundaries
since it enables one to discriminate among the boundary terms that
may be added to the action. the point is that if a given choice of the
action s[] fullls s = 0 on the classical histories, it is in general

not true that (s + b) = 0 where b = r jddx is a surface
term, since one may have b 6= 0. this criterion xes for instance
the form of the conserved charges in gauge theories. it was used in
particular in [1] to establish that the action for einstein gravity must
be supplemented by the time-integral of the adm mass at innity in
the case of asymptotically at spaces.

the purpose of this paper is to show that the same criterion xes
the form of the boundary term that must be added to the standard
dirac action [2] in the ads/cft correspondence [3, 4, 5]. besides
its intrinsic interest, this problem illustrates quite well the general
fact that the action is much more than just a mere mnemonic device
whose only purpose is to concisely summarize the equations of motion.
although all lagrangians l that dier by a local divergence j have
identical euler-lagrange derivatives, it is only for a special subclass of
these lagrangians that the euler-lagrange equations are equivalent

2

to the statement that the action s = r ddxl is stationary in the class
of histories entering the variational principle (i.e., r ddxl is equal to

zero and not a non-vanishing boundary term).

we refer to the literature for background information on the ads/cft

correspondence (see [6] for a recent review) and shall discuss here only
the problem of boundary terms1.

2 dirac equations on adsd+1

we follow [2] and consider free spinor elds of mass m on (euclidean)
adsd+1. we take poincare coordinates x = (x0, xi) = (x0, x) (i =
1, . . . , d) such that adsd+1 is the domain x0 > 0 with metric

ds2 = g dxdx = (x0)2(dx0dx0 + ds2).

(2.1)

in (2.1), the d-dimensional ds2 is the at metric

in the local lorentz frame

ds2 = dx  dx.

 = (x0)1a
ea



the dirac operator 6d is given by [2]

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

where the matrices a = (0, i) = (0, ) are the at space gamma-
matrices and where the notation  = (0, i) = (0,) is used.

the dirac equations read

(6d  m) = 0
(6d  m) = 0

(2.5)

for  and

(2.6)
for the conjugate spinor . without loss of generality, we assume m
to be positive.

1the actual talk given in tbilissi did not deal with the subject covered in this paper
but with the ads central charge c = 3l/2g that arises in the asymptotic conformal algebra
of (2 + 1)-ads gravity.

3

the equations of motion can be solved near the boundary x0 = 0
by the standard frobenius procedure. one tries solutions of the form
n=0 cn(x)(x0)n where cn(x) are x0-independent spinors. for

this series to solve the equations,  must be given by

(x0) p

 =

d
2  m

(2.7)

and the rst coecient c0(x) should be annihilated by i  0 or i + 0
depending on which value of  is taken. there are thus two types of
solutions near x0 = 0. solutions of the rst type are annihilated by
the matrix i + 0 to leading order and behave asymptotically as

(x) = (x0)

m0(x) + o(cid:16)(x0)

d
2

m(cid:17)

(2.8)

(x0  0) where 0(x) is an eigenvector of 0 for the eigenvalue 1
but is otherwise arbitrary,

00(x) = 0(x).

(2.9)

solutions of the second type start with higher powers of x0 and are
annihilated by i  0 to leading order. they behave asymptotically
as
(2.10)
(x0  0) where now 0(x) is an arbitrary eigenvector of 0 for the
eigenvalue +1,
(2.11)

2 +m0(x) + o(cid:16)(x0)

00(x) = 0(x).

similarly, one nds for the conjugate spinors

+(x) = 0(x)(x0)

0(x)0 = 0(x)

and

(x) = 0(x)(x0)
0(x)0 =  0(x).

one may construct recursively the next terms in the solutions by
using the dirac equations. in order to formulate the boundary con-

ditions below, we note that up to terms of order o((x0)

where p is the biggest integer such that p  2m and where n and
n are denite dierential operators in d dimensions which can be
computed from the dirac equations (e.g., 1    ) and whose
explicit form will not be needed in the sequel2.
the general solution near x0 = 0 is obtained by superposition
of (x) and +(x). it is determined by the boundary data 0(x)
and 0(x), which may be taken independently at this stage. the
leading order of the solution is determined by 0(x), which fullls
(i + 0)0(x) = 0. the other boundary datum 0(x) is (non triv-
ially) relevant at lower orders. thus, to leading order, the general
solution of the dirac equation near x0 = 0 belongs to the eigenspace
of 0 with eigenvalue 1. the next order belongs to the eigenspace
with eigenvalue +1. this peeling o property of dirac elds is rem-
iniscent of what happens for rarita-schwinger elds [8].

if one demands that the solution be well-behaved in the volume of
anti-de sitter space adsd+1 up to x0 =  (which consists of a single
boundary point since the metric along x vanishes in the limit x0  
[5, 6]3), one nds that 0(x) and 0(x) cannot be taken independently.
rather, they must be related as

where 0(k) and 0(k) are the respective fourier transforms of 0(x)
and 0(x), and where k = k2. one must similarly impose

0(k) = i 0(k)

2one may actually need (log x0) (x0)

2 +m-terms when m is a half-integer but we will
not write explicitly these terms - also determined by the rst terms in the expansion -
when they are needed. the formulas (2.18) and (2.19) below assume m 6= a half-integer.
3this point is the compactication point at innity of x0 = 0 [5]. we shall assume that
the data 0(x) and 0(x) can be fourier-transformed in x (e.g., are of compact support)
and so vanish for |x|  . for regularity, the solution must then vanish for x0  .

these relations follow from the work of [2, 7], where the general
solution that vanishes for x0   is explicitly constructed. one nds

where the dots denote positive integer powers of (z)2, one can verify
that the solutions behave as indicated above for x0  0, and that
0(x) and 0(x) are related to 0(x) and 0(x) as written in (2.18)
and (2.19). the leading term in (x) comes from the rst term in
the expansion of b(k); the leading term in +(x) comes from the
second term in the expansion of a(k) (coecient of (x0)m

2 ).

it follows that the general solution of the dirac equations in the
whole of ads is determined by a single spinor eld annihilated by 1+0
on the boundary [2, 9]. half of the boundary data are expressed in

6

terms of the other half if the solution is to be a solution everywhere.
it should be stressed, however, that (2.18) and (2.19) are on-shell
relations valid for solutions of the classical equations of motion but not
for all competing histories considered in the variational principle. in
fact, one can easily construct o-shell congurations which are regular
in the whole of adsd+1 and which involve independent  and + in
the vicinity of x0 = 0.

3 variational principle

because the dirac equations contain only rst order derivatives, one
cannot x simultaneously all the components of  and  at x0 =
0. this would be like xing both qs and ps at the boundary, and
this is not permissible. rather, one can only x a complete set of
commuting variables, e.g.
the qs or the ps. for the ads/cft
correspondence, it is appropriate to x the components 0 and 0,
which are the sources for the green functions in d dimensions [2] and
to leave 0(x) and 0(x) free to vary. we shall thus consider in the
variational principle all congurations which take the form

(x) = (x) + +(x),
(x) = +(x) + (x)

(3.1)

(3.2)
where (x) and +(x) behave asymptotically (x0  0) as in (2.16)
and (2.17) with given 0(x) and 0(x), while +(x) and (x) behave
asymptotically as (2.10) and (2.14) with coecients 0(x) and 0(x)
2 +m(cid:17) terms in (x) and (x) are
that are free to vary. the o(cid:16)(x0)
of course also allowed to vary and need not be such that the histories
(x) and (x) are solutions of the dirac equations.

d

so, one does not (and cannot) impose any relationship between
0(x) and 0(x) or 0(x) and 0(x) in the variational principle. the
relations (2.18) and (2.19) emerge on-shell.
if one varies the standard dirac action

sd = zads

dd+1xg h 1

2

(6d  6d )  mi

(3.3)

with respect to  and  in the class of eld congurations just dened,
one nds, keeping all surface terms,

sd = b + terms that vanish when the dirac equations hold (3.4)

7

where b is given by

1

b = 

2 z ddx[ 0(x)0(x) +  0(x)0(x)]

(3.5)
(recall that (d+1)g = (x0)d1). this term is itself the variation of
a surface term at innity,

b = c

with

c =

1

2 z ddx[ 0(x)0(x) + 0(x)0(x)]

(3.6)

(3.7)

since  0(x) = 0 and 0(x) = 0.

because b 6= 0, the action sd is not stationary on the dirac
solutions in the class of competing histories dened by the boundary
conditions that 0 and 0 are xed while 0 and 0 are free to vary.
however, the improved action obtained by adding c to sd,

s = sd + c

(3.8)

is such that s = 0 on-shell. it is therefore s (and not sd) that must
be used in the ads/cft correspondence.

three comments are in order:
1. since 0(x) and 0(x) are xed, one may add any function of
these variables to s without changing the property that s = 0.
such terms correspond to phase transformations. however,
if one requires that the surface term (i) is local; (ii) does not
contain derivatives (because the bulk part is rst-order); and
(iii) preserves the ads symmetry, then, (3.7) appears to be the
only choice ( 00 = 0). note in particular that the coecient of
c in (3.7) is completely determined.

2. up to terms which give delta-function contact terms in the cor-
relators and which are thus unimportant [10] (even though they
may contain powers of  that blow up as   0), one may rewrite
the surface term (3.7) as

c = lim
0

1

2 zm

ddxq(d)g 

(3.9)

where m is a d-dimensional surface that approaches the bound-
ary of adsd+1 as  goes to zero, and where (d)g is the determi-
nant of the induced metric on m. this agrees with [2].

8

3. the kinetic term in the action (with x0 being the time) shows
that 0(x) and 0(x) (respectively, 0(x) and 0(x)) form canon-
ically conjugate pairs. so, one is indeed xing the qs and leaving
the ps free to vary at the boundary.

4 correlation functions

we can now compute the correlation functions, following closely [2,
7]. to that end, one needs the value scl of the classical action. as
stressed in [2], the standard dirac action vanishes on-shell and the
whole contribution comes from the surface term. replacing in c the
spinors 0(x) and 0(x) by their on-shell values given by (2.18) and
(2.19) yields

scl =

|x  y|d+2m+1

(4.2)

(4.3)

as shown in [2, 7] and in agreement with the cft on the boundary.

5 conclusions

in this paper, we have shown that the surface term needed in the
ads/cft correspondence for spinor elds can be understood from
the requirement that the variational principle has a solution in the
relevant class of eld histories. this class of eld histories is charac-
terized by the boundary data at x0 = 0: one xes the components of

9

the spinor elds that are annihilated by i + 0 but not the compo-
nents with opposite chirality. these components come with a higher
power of x0 but play a non trivial role because they do contribute to
the boundary terms. they are unrelated o-shell to the prescribed
components of  and are free to vary in the variational principle, al-
though they become functions of these prescribed components when
the dirac equations hold everywhere.
note added: a dierent (but equivalent) justication of the boundary
term has been given recently in [11]. it is based on the hamiltonian
formalism with x0 viewed as the evolution parameter. it is equivalent
to the requirement that the classical path be a true stationary point,
since this imposes the form p q (rather than  pq, say) to the kinetic
term in the hamiltonian action in the coordinate representation where
the qs are given at the boundary [12]. i am grateful to kostas sfetsos
for pointing out reference [11] to me.
