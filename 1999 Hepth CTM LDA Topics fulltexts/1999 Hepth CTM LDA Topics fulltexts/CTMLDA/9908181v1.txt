abstract

we study spin one particles interacting through a chern-simons eld. in the
born approximation, we calculate the two body scattering amplitude consid-
ering three possible ways to introduce the interaction: (a) a proca like model
minimally coupled to a chern-simons eld, (b) the model obtained from (a)
by replacing the procas mass by a chern-simons term and (c) a complex
maxwell-chern-simons model minimally coupled to a chern-simons eld. in
the low energy regime the results show similarities with the aharonov-bohm
scattering for spin 1/2 particles. we discuss the one loop renormalization
program for the procas model. in spite of the bad ultraviolet behavior of
the matter eld propagator, we show that, up to one loop the model is power
counting renormalizable thanks to the ward identities satised by the inter-
action vertices.

i. introduction

in the recent years much work has been devoted to the study of the properties of the
chern-simons (cs) eld [1]. this was motivated not only by its potential applications
to condensed matter physics but also because these studies have unveiled some new and
interesting aspects of the dynamics of relativistic quantum physics.
in particular, it has
been noticed that in some circumstances the cs eld plays a stabilizing role providing
theories with improved ultraviolet behavior [2]. however, most of these investigations have
been restricted to the cases of spinless and spin 1/2 particles. the reasons behind this
fact are the notorious diculties found in the conventional treatment for higher spin elds
in four dimensions. the troublesome aspects include noncausal propagation and lack of
renormalizability. it is certainly worthwhile to study the interaction of a cs and spin one
matter elds so that the origin of the diculties could be better understood and perhaps
new and safer routes could be found. with this in mind, we would like to present here the
results of some investigations concerning the dynamics of spin one elds interacting through
a cs term.

as a rst observation, we note that a free, spin one particle of mass m can be described

alternatively by the proca lagrangian,

where f =   , or by the maxwell-chern-simons (mcs) lagrangian,

lm cs =

[ + ()].

(2)

whereas the rst formulation encompasses both modes of spin 1, the latter, eq. (2),
represents only a single mode of spin m/|m|. the two formulations are not entirely inequiv-
alent, however. the model (2) is equivalent to the self-dual model, [3,4], and this last model
is like a square root of the procas, [5]. nevertheless, such equivalence does not in general
persists whenever the models are coupled to other dynamical elds [6]. in this investigation
we will study the two body scattering amplitude for the cases of minimal coupling of (1)
to a cs eld and when in (1) the proca mass m 2 is replaced by a complex cs term.
we will also consider the case of minimal coupling of (2) to a cs eld. analogously to the
scattering of lower spin particles we will expect to nd similarities with the aharonov-bohm
(ab) scattering [7]. we may recall that for spinless particles the born approximation found
in the perturbative method only agrees with the expansion of the exact result if a contact in-
teraction, simulated in the eld theory approach by a quartic ()2 interaction, is included
from the beginning [8, 9]. it is also known that in the spin 1/2 case no new interaction is
needed, the role of the quartic interaction being played by the magnetic pauli term [10].

we will pursue the investigation of the spin eects on the perturbative ab scattering by
considering spin one particles. previous work in this direction started either with a complex
proca eld minimally coupled to the electromagnetic eld [11] or with a linearized yang mills
equation [12]. in both approaches the ab scattering was discussed from a rst quantized
viewpoint. here we consider the problem from the perspective of the theory of quantum
elds, i. e., as the low energy limit of a fully quantized relativistic theory of spin one particles
interacting through a cs eld. one advantage of such procedure is that it incorporates some
purely quantum eld eects, as vacuum polarization and anomalous magnetic momentum.
for the proca model minimally coupled to a cs eld we will discuss the one loop renor-
malization program and calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of the matter eld. as
we will show, thanks to the ward identities satised by the basic interaction vertices, up
to one loop the model is renormalizable, in spite of the bad behavior of the propagator
of the matter eld. the mcs model, on the other hand, turns out to be power counting
renormalizable to all orders of perturbation.

our work is organized as follows. in section ii we present the polarization vectors and
feynman rules for the models mentioned above. there, we also study the born approxi-
mation for the two body scattering amplitudes. in section iii we discuss in detail the one
loop renormalization parts for the proca model and also determine the anomalous magnetic
moment. a discussion of our results is presented in section iv. the paper contains also an
appendix with details of the calculations.

ii. polarization vectors and feynman rules

as a preliminary step toward our study of the ab scattering of two spin one particles,
let us examine some of the kinematic aspects of the asymptotic theories. first of all, being a

2

transversal eld,  = 0, the proca eld described by (1) can be expanded in plane waves
as

 =

1

2 z d2p

2wp

x=1


[aeipx + beipx],

(3)

where wp = ~p2 + m 2 and the polarization vectors satisfy the transversality condition
p

 = 0. a convenient choice is

1 = (0, ij pj

|~p|

)

2 = (|~p|

m

,

wp

).

pi
|~p|

(4)

the creation operators a and b allow us to construct the fock space of the asymptotic
states. in this space, we found that the spin part of the angular momentum operator

j = z d2x ijxi : t 0j : ,

where t  = f 

 f  + f 

 f   glp , is given by

js = iz d2p

2wp

x,=1

(p)j

(p) [a(p)a(p) + b(p)b(p)].

in the particles rest frame we can see that

| p = 0, s = 1 >=

are eigenstates of (6).

as discussed in [13], in the case of the mcs model, eq. (2) one has just one polarization

which can be taken as

(k) = (0(k), i(k)) ,

(8)

where 0(k) =
polarization vector in the particles rest frame.

and i(k) = i(0) +

|m|(wp+|m|)ki with (0) = 12 (cid:16)0, 1, i m

|m|(cid:17) being the

minimally coupling the proca eld to a cs eld, a, leads us to the lagrangian

where g = d d and d = iea. the feynman rules associated to the above
lagrangian are depicted in fig. 1. in the landau gauge (  ), the analytic expressions
accompanying these rules are:

(14)

(15)

(16)

the expressions (14) and (15) are typical of gauge theories being similar to the ones
found in scalar qed. these properties will be helpful to discuss the ultraviolet behavior of
the green functions.

to make contact with the aharonov-bohm scattering, let us study the low energy ap-
proximation for the scattering of two vector particles. we assume that in the center of
mass frame the incoming particles have momenta p1 = (wp, ~p) and p2 = (wp,~p) and spins
s1 and s2, respectively. we will then denote the momenta and spins of the outgoing par-
ticles by p3 = (wp, ~p ), p4 = (wp,~p ) and s3, s4. the energy of the incoming particle
is wp = m2 + ~p2, the spins si can either take the values 1 and |~p| = |~p |. the tree
approximation for this process is

mf i = h(p3, s3)

1

+(p3  p4, s3  s4) ,

(p1, p3)(p1, s1)i d(q)h(p4, s4)

1

where q = p1  p3 and

(p, s) =


1 (p) + is

2 (p)

2

,

(p2, p4)(p2, s2)i

(17)

(18)

1 (p) and 

with 
2 (p) as in (4), are circularly polarized vectors. from the above expressions
we can verify that the scattering amplitude vanishes unless spin is conserved, i.e., s1 = s3
and s2 = s4 or s1 = s4 and s2 = s3.

after expanding in powers of |~p|/m, we get, in leading order,

mf i(s, ~p, ~p) =

4ie2|m|



is

2

e

[s + 2i cot()] ,

(19)

4

where  is the scattering angle and s = s1 + s2 is the total spin of the incoming particles.
similarly to the spin 1/2 case, the origin of the constant term in eq.
(19) is a pauli
interaction between each vector particle and the magnetic eld produced by the other. in
the anti-parallel case these eects cancel each other.

let us now consider a model in which the mass of the vector particles has a topological
origin. in such situation, one should use the polarization vector given in eq. (8). one can
then envisage two possibilities to introduce the coupling to the cs eld. one could use (9)
but with the proca mass replaced by a topological one, i.e.,

m 2 

m
2

 +

m
2

()

(20)

or just consider the mcs eld described by (2) minimally coupled to a cs eld. had we
employed a topological mass instead of the procas, the feynman rules would be the same
unless for the propagator for the matter eld which would become



m cs =

i

p2  m 2 + i "g 

pp

p2 + im p

p2# .

(21)

as this propagator has a better ultraviolet behavior than (11), the corresponding theory will
be in principle renormalizable.

using this propagator we found a scattering amplitude,

4ie2|m|



[s + 2i cot()] ,

(22)

which diers from (19) just by a phase factor. in the case of minimal coupling we get a
result which contains an additional numerical factor, 1/4 , in the front of (22). the two
possible couplings give dierent cross sections and, at the present, there is no way to select
a preferred one. besides that, radiative correction should produce diverse cross sections
even in the cases associated to (19) and (22) where the corresponding lagrangians dier
only by the mass terms. this is apparent from an inspection of the asymptotic behavior
of the matter eld vector propagators. in the case of the lagrangian with a proca mass,
the longitudinal term in the propagator spoils renormalizability. however, a more careful
analysis, to be done in the next section, shows that the degree of supercial divergence is
actually lowered. taking into consideration this fact we conclude that the eective degree
of divergence for a generic one loop graph  is

d() = 3  na 

1
2

n ,

(23)

where na and n are the number of external lines belonging to the cs and to the matter
vector eld. in spite of the improved behavior, as established by (23), the model still suers
from renormalization problems due to the divergence of graphs with n equal to four and
six. if the corresponding counterterms are added to (9) then the relations (14-16) will not
be able to guarantee renormalizability even at one loop. actually, higher order loops will
contain nonrenormalizable divergences. the model is renormalizable only up to one loop.
of course these comments do not apply if the mass has a topological origin.

5

iii. one loop renormalization

as we will show now, the one loop contributions to the amplitudes for the theory dened
by eq. (9) have an eective degree of divergence as given in (23). by power counting, any
one loop graph with ncs and n internal cs and matter eld lines, and containing v1 and
v2 trilinear and quadrilinear vertices has the degree of supercial divergence given by

where we used

d() = 3  ncs + v1 = 3 

n
2

+ v1,

ncs + n = v1 + v2,
2n + n = 2v1 + 2v2,
2ncs + ncs = v1 + 2v2.

(24)

(25)
(26)
(27)

formula (23) follows now from the following observations:

1. (14) and (15) imply that the sum of graphs with ncs external cs lines will contain
cs power of the external momenta and therefore in such sum the degree of divergence

the n th
is eectively reduced by ncs.

2. besides that, due to (16) the contraction of the longitudinal part of the matter eld
propagator with the vertex 1 produces a result whose degree in the loop momentum is
reduced by v1.

after establishing (23) we shall now examine each case of divergence, i. e. with d()  0,
as specied by (23). notice that logarithmically divergent parts are odd in the integration
variables and therefore vanish under symmetric integration. this implies that, up to one
loop, the six point vertex function of the matter eld and the four point function with
external lines associated to two cs eld and two matter elds do not generate counterterms.
however the radiative corrections to the two and to the four point vertex function of the
matter eld, the vacuum polarization and the trilinear vertex all have d() > 0. we shall
examine separately each one of them. we will employ dimensional regularization which, for
the cases under consideration, already acts as a renormalization. let us begin by the self-
energy contributions which in one loop correspond to the graphs shown in fig. 2. symmetric
integration show immediately that the contributions of the graphs 2(b) and 2(c) vanish. the
amplitude associated to 2(a) is (details of this calculation are presented in the appendix)

(p) = z

d3k
(2)3 

1

(p, p + k) (p + k) 

1

(p + k, p)d(k).

(28)

although the degree of divergence indicates a quartic divergence, because of eq. (16),

the above expression diverges only quadratically. we obtain

(p) =

e2
8

f (p)p ,

where (from now on we assume m to be positive)

f (p) =

(3m 2 + p2)

2mp2

"(m 2 + p2)

2mp2

(m 2  p2)2 log  m + p2

m  p2!# .

6

(29)

(30)

although nite the above expression does not vanish at p2 = m 2. to secure that the physical
mass is m one still have to proceed a nite renormalization. thus we dene a renormalized
amplitude by


r (p) = (p)  mp
fr(p)p ,

=

e2

"3m 2  p2 

(m 2  p2)(3m 2 + p2)

2mp2

log  m + p2

m  p2!# .

where m = e2m

2 and
(m 2  p2)

2mp2

fr(p) =

in this situation we obtain the renormalized propagator,



r =

i

p2  m 2  (p2) "g  1 

where

(p2)

p2 ! pp

m 2  i(p)p# ,

(p2) =

r(p)
(p2  m 2)

and

(p) =

fr(p)

(p2  m 2)

.

one sees that the needed counterterm corresponds to a cs term for the matter eld.

let us now focus our attention on the vacuum polarization contributions to the cs eld

two point function. the associated graphs have been drawn in fig. 3. we have

(40)

implying that the eective low momentum lagrangian contains a maxwell term, analogously
to what happens in the spin 1/2 case.

the lowest order contributions to the trilinear vertex come from the rst three graphs

shown in fig. 4. the corresponding analytic expressions are respectively

great simplication occurs. indeed, performing the calculations on the matter elds mass

we are now in a position to calculate the vector meson anomalous magnetic moment.
usually this done by coupling the matter eld to an external electromagnetic eld. besides
that, to disentangle the various contributions, here it is also convenient to do the calculations

8

in a particular frame where ~p + ~p  = 0, the breit frame. it is then found that the magnetic
moment is given by [14]

where

 = lim

2m

ij

qj
q2 i(~p,~p) ,

i(~p,~p) = (~p, s)i(~p,~p)(~p, s) ,

(48)

(49)

and the limit prescription singles out the term proportional to ~q. in the tree approximation
we get

 =

e
2m

gs = 

e
2m

,

(50)

where s = 1 is the spin. the above result means that the gyromagnetic factor is g = 1.
the gyromagnetic factor may be changed (sometimes g = 2 is desirable [15]) if the magnetic
term [16]

lmag = ie(a  a)

(51)

is added to (9).
in such case, it is easy to check that the magnetic moment for a spin
one particle becomes e(1 + )/(2m). nevertheless, as the new vertex (51) does not obey
eq. (16) the ultraviolet behavior of the green functions is denitely wrecked. thus, if one
insists in having g = 2 another approach becomes mandatory. for this reason we shall not
anymore consider the possibility of adding (51). after these remarks let us proceed toward
the computation of the anomalous magnetic moment. from the expressions for the three
graphs given above we have

ac(~p,~p) = (~p, s)i
i

a+b+c(~p, s) =

3e3

(52)

we still have to add the contributions of the graphs 4(d) and 4(e) which corresponds to

the analytic expressions

(57)

(58)

(59)

it should be noticed that the graphs with self energy corrections contribute signicantly to
the nal result. this is similar to what happens for the case of spin 1/2 particles in the
coulomb gauge and results from the fact that in both cases the interaction with the cs eld
modies the free propagators in an essential way. in our case, as can be seen from (29) a
cs term is produced.

it is also worthwhile to remark that, as in the spin 1/2 case, the anomalous magnetic

moment has the same sign for both spin up and spin down situations [10].

iv. discussion

the calculation of the radiative corrections to the propagators and vertices done in
the previous section allow us to incorporate vacuum polarization and anomalous magnetic
moment eects in the two body scattering amplitudes computed earlier. in fact, in the low
energy regime we get

for the contributions from the vertex corrections indicated in fig. 5a. the result for fig. 5b
is obtained from the above expressions by exchanging s3 and s4. for the vacuum polarization
diagram, fig. 5c, we found the result

[(1 + s2s4) cos   i(s2 + s4) sin ].

(64)

the next diagram, fig. 5d, does not contribute at leading order of |~p|/m. to complete
the one loop calculation it is still necessary to compute the contributions of the triangle (fig.
5e and 5f) and box (fig. 5g and 5h) diagrams. these graphs present a logarithmic ultraviolet
divergence (by lorentz covariance the would be linear divergence does not appear). besides
that they are so much intricate that even using dimensional regularization and employing
an algebraic computer program the integrals did not turned out to be feasible.

to summarize, in this work we have studied some properties of spin one particles inter-
acting through a cs eld. as argued in the introduction, this is a complex system but we
found some simplications which allowed us to study its behavior up to the one loop level.
we have indicated other possible scheme as the use of the complex mcs model minimally
coupled to a cs term. although this model is power counting renormalizable, the algebraic
structure is very much cumbersome that no practical results are possible even at the one
loop level. in such situation the scheme adopted by us seems to be the most useful although
not being easily generalizable to higher orders.

the computation of the remaining parametric integration is straightforward and produces
the result (30).

let us now turn to the polarization tensor. from (35) and (36) and proceeding analo-

gously to what we have done before we arrive at

+ [3m 2(pk + kp  6gkp)] + [m 2(4m 2g + pp  3p2g)] .

(a6)

employing again feynmans formula (a1), translating the integration variable,k  k  px
and deleting the terms odd in k, results

dxz
where, as before, a2 = m 2  p2x(1  x) and

m 2 z 1

+ [2kpkp + 2pkkp  2g(kp)2] .
with the help of dimensional regularization this becomes

the parametric integration can be done exactly producing the result (37).
