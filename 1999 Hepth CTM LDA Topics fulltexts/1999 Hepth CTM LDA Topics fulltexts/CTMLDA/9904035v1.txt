abstract

we propose a eld theory argument, which rests on the non-renormalization of
the two point function of the energy-momentum tensor, why the ratio between the
entropies of strongly coupled and weakly coupled n = 4 is of order one.

the maldacena conjecture [1] and the entropy of near-extremal d3-branes [2] imply

that the ratio between the entropies, at xed temperature, of strongly coupled and weakly
coupled n = 4 is 3/4. in n = 4, unlike 2d cft, the entropy is not protected thus it
is not surprising that the ratio is not 1. it is surprising, however, that the ratio is not a
function of the t hooft coupling,  = g2

y m n, which vanishes when   .

the reason is the following perturbative argument.1 at nite temperature, t , the
expectation value of the elds is h2i = t 2. as a result the potential term in sym, which
y m [i, j]2, induces a mass, m2  t 2, for a generic eld. at small
has the form v  g2
t hooft coupling the induced masses are much smaller then the temperature so to a
good approximation the contribution to the entropy is of n 2 massless elds with a small
correction which reduces the entropy.2 at large t hooft coupling the induced masses
are much larger then the temperature. therefore, the contribution to the entropy from
a generic eld (not in the cartan subalgebra of su(n)) is suppressed at the strongly
coupled region.

since the argument above rests on perturbation theory it cannot be trusted all the

way to the strongly coupled region and hence, strictly speaking, there is no contradiction
with the maldacena conjecture. still, it is fair to say that it is somewhat disturbing that

1though this argument is widely known we did not nd it in the literature. a closely related discussion

can be found in [3, 4].

the only eld theory argument available (as far as we know) leads to that conclusion.
especially, when a similar argument for sym in 1 + 1 dimensions [3, 4] leads to results

that t so nicely into the maldacena conjecture for d1-branes [6, 7, 8].

the purpose of this short note is to put forward a eld theory argument, which does

not rest on the ads/cft correspondence, that implies that the entropy at large coupling
is of the order of the entropy at weak coupling. the argument rests on the n = 4
non-renormalization theorem for the energy-momentum tensor two point function and
therefore it cannot be generalised to two dimensional sym which is a non-conformal
theory and hence the r-symmetry cannot protect the two-point function.

we study sym in a box whose volume is lza with a = lxly and we take the limit
lx, ly  lz. consider the transformation x3  x3(1  ) with   1. the variation of
the action under this transformation is

s = z d3xz lz

0

dx3t33.

(1)

therefore, the variation of the expectation value of t00 is

ht00(0)i = z d(e(s+s)  es)t00(0) = z d3xz lz

0

dx3ht00(0)t33(x)i,

(2)

where d represents integration with respect to all elds. to calculate the integral we need
to know the energy-momentum tensor two point function. on r4 non-renormalization
theorem protects the energy-momentum tensor two point function. thus on r4 we can
use the free sym result

ht (0)t (x)i =

n 2
x8 ,

(3)

where we have suppressed numerical factors of order one and the lorentz indices (for
details see [9]).

however, what we need is not the two-point function in r4 but rather in r3  s1. in
two dimensions the conformal transformation group contains the transformation from r2
to r  s1. therefore, the two-points function in r  s1 are determined by the two-points
function in r2 and the dimensions of the operators. this is an important ingredient in
cardys proof that the asymptotic growth of the number of state of a 2d cft depends
only on the central charge and not on the details of the cft [10, 11]. in four dimensions,
however, the conformal transformations do not contain the transformation from r4 to
r3  s1. thus, we do not know the exact form of the energy-momentum two point
function for strongly coupled sym on r3  s1.3

3for weakly coupled theories one can nd directly on r3  s 1 the mode expansion of the relevant

elds. so there is no need to start with the two-points function on r4.

what we do know is that at distances smaller then lz the boundary condition is
irrelevant and so eq.(3) is a good approximation at short distances. therefore, for a given
point on s1 we can calculate the contribution to ht00(x3)i from the region |x3 x
3| < lz.
the integral divergent at short distances. the regularized result is ht00(0)i  n 2
.

integrating over the volume we nd the variation of the ground state energy, which yields
after integration with respect to lz = lz, the ground state energy

it is important to emphasis that we have assumed in the calculation of ht00i that the
integration over the whole region does not contain cancellations between the region where
eq.(3) is a good approximation and the region where it is not. such cancellations can,
in principle, reduce the ground state energy in a signicant way to yield e0 which is
suppressed at large coupling. therefore, our argument is not a proof but rather a strong
indication that the entropies ratio is of order one. in other words, we estimate the casimir

energy, which is a boundary condition eect, using an approximation which is not sensitive
to the details of the boundary condition but only to the distance between the boundaries.

eq.(4) implies that the partition function at low temperature (compared to lz) is,

z  exp n 2a
z ! .

4 to end up
now we can use the standard argument of switching the roles of  and lz
with the partition function of strongly coupled sym at high temperature (compared to

the size of the box)

z  exp(n 2v t 3),

(6)

which agrees, up to a numerical factor in the exponent, with the partition function of

weakly coupled sym.
