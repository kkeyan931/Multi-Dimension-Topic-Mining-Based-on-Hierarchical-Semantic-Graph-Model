abstract

the winding number transition in the mottola-wipf model with and without

skyrme term is examined. for the model with skyrme term the number of

discrete modes of the uctuation operator around sphaleron is shown to be

dependent on the value of 2. following gorokhov and blatter we derive a

sucient condition for the sharp rst-order transition, which indicates that

rst-order transition occurs when 0 < 2 < 0.0399 and 2.148 < 2. in the

intermediate region of 2 the winding number transition is conjectured to

be smooth second order. for the model without skyrme term the winding

number transition is always rst order regardless of the value of parameter.

i. introduction

quantum tunneling is one of the most fascinating phenomenon arised due to pure quan-

tum eect and has profound physical implications in many fundamental phenomena in var-

ious branches of physics. after langer [1] and coleman [2] opened a door of the computa-

tional methodology for the investigation of the tunneling using a classical euclidean solution

called instanton or bounce, its generlization to the nite temperature tunneling or thermal

activation is one of the long-standing subject in this eld. it is well-known that as tem-

perature increases from zero temperature the pure quantum tunneling at low temperature

is gradually changed to the thermal activation at high temperature via thermally assisted

tunneling region. this means there is a phase transition between sphaleron [3]-dominated

high temperature regime and the instanton-dominated low temperature regime. this phase

transition was explored within quantum mechanical models by aeck [4] and cosmological

models by linde [5] about two decades ago. both of them argued that there exist periodic

solutions [6] which govern the tunneling at intermediate temperature regime and interpolate

smoothly between vacuum instanton and sphaleron. using a terminology of the statistical

mechanics this phenomenon can be referred to second-order transition.

chudnovsky [7], however, showed that this argument is not generic and the sharp rst-

order transition can occur in real nature. conjecturing action-vs-temperature graph from

period-vs-energy gure, he also classied several possible types of the transition. recently,

his idea is realized at the spin tunneling system [8] in condensed matter physics.

subsequently, gorokhov and blatter [9] extended chudnovskys idea and derived a suf-

cient condition for the rst-order transition using only small uctuation around sphaleron.

although they derived the criterion to apply it to the some elds of the condensed matter

physics [9,10], its application to the covariant eld theories is straightforward. in fact, this

criterion is applied to the four-dimensional scalar eld theory with a asymmetric double

well potential and the lower and upper bounds of the critical value of symmetry breaking

parameter is calculated [11]. recently, same criterion with that of gorokhov and blatter is

2

derived again through completely dierent point of view by counting carefully the number

of negative modes for the full hessian of periodic solution near sphaleron [12].

in this paper we will examine the winding number transition of the mottola-wipf(mw)

model [13] with and without skyrme term [14] and clarify the type of the transition in the

full range of parameter space. since the method of ref. [12] for the study of winding number

transition needs a periodic instanton solution which is very complicated [15] in this model,

we will follow the procedure of ref. [9].

mw model, non-linear o(3) model with a soft breaking term, is usually adopted as a

toy model for the study of the sphaleron transition of electroweak theories [16]. although

localized vacuum instanton does not exist in this model, the analytical expression of the

sphaleron solution was derived by paralleling mantons original argument in ref. [13].

in order to make a modied model which supports a localized vacuum instanton as well

as sphaleron piette et al [17] added a skyrme term to this model. in this modied model

whose action and constraint are

s =

1

g2 z d dx"1

2

aa + 2(1 + 3) +


8

#
ab
ab

(1.1)

aa = 1,

a = 1, 2, 3 ,  = , x

where ab

 = ab  ab, sphaleron is identical to that of mw model whose action
is eq.(1.1) with  = 0 and localized instanton can be obtained numerically. winding number

transition between instanton-dominated and sphaleron-dominated regimes in this model are

discussed at particulur value of parameter, 2 = 0.001, in ref. [18]. in this paper we will

discuss the winding number transition in the full range of parameter space.

the paper is organized as follows. in sec.ii we will briey review gorokhov and blatters

procedure in covariant scalar eld theory. in sec.iii we will expand the eld equation of

mottola-wipf-skyrme(mws) model around sphaleron solution by introducing the uctua-

tion elds u and v. the spectra of the spatial uctuation operators hu and hv are discussed

at sec.iv. in sec.v following gorokhov and blatter we will examine the winding number

transition in mws model. it will be shown that the type of transition is either rst-order

3

or second-order depending on the value of 2. in sec.vi the winding number transition

in mw model will be discussed. it will be shown that the type of transition in this model

is always rst order regardless of value of parameter. in sec.vii a brief conclusion will be

given.

ii. criterion for sharp first-order transition

in this section we will review the procedure of ref. [9] briey in the covariant eld theory.

the euclidean action we will consider is

where eld equation is

s = z dx(cid:20) 1

2

 + v ()(cid:21)

 = v ().

(2.1)

(2.2)

although we do not need a specic form of v (), we assume eld equation allows periodic

instanton and sphaleron congurations. since sphaleron sph is static conguration, its

equation of motion reads

2sph
x2 = v (sph).

(2.3)

now, we consider a small uctuation (x,  ) around sphaleron solution. if one uses taylor

expansion in potential, it is easy to show (x,  ) satises upto the order of 3

l(x,  ) = h(x,  ) + g2[] + g3[]

(2.4)

where l = 2

 2 , h =  2

x2 + v (sph), g2[] = 1

2v (sph)2, and g3[] = 1

6 v (sph)3. the

main idea of ref. [9] is to compare the frequency of (x,  ) with that of sphaleron by solving

eq.(2.4) perturbatively, which yields a sucient condition for the rst-order transition.

to lowest order in perturbation we use ansatz

(x,  ) = au0(x) cos sph.

(2.5)

4

here, a is a small parameter, which is associated with small amplitude of periodic solution

whose center is sph at quantum mechanical model. substituting eq.(2.5) into eq.(2.4) while

neglecting terms of order higher than a2 one obtains

hu0(x) = l(sph)u0(x)

(2.6)

where l() = 2. since spatial operator h has only one negative mode and l(sph) <
0, u0(x) and l(sph) are nothing but the ground state eigenfunction and eigenvalue of h,

respectively. this fact allows one to calculate sph by solving the spectrum of h.

to next order perturbation we use

(x,  ) = au0(x) cos  + a21(x,  )

(2.7)

where  is the correction to the frequency sph. inserting eq.(2.7) into eq.(2.4) it is easy to

obtain

where

1 = (l  h)11

1 =

1
a

[l(sph)  l()] u0(x) cos  + g2[u0] cos2 .

(2.8)

(2.9)

since l  h has zero mode | u0(x) cos  >, we can escape innity in eq.(2.8) if and only
if a condition < u0(x) cos  | 1 >= 0 holds. this condition requires no shift in the
frequency  = sph, which means that next order perturbation must be performed to nd

frequency shift. before we go to the next order, it is in order to compute 1 explicitly. it is

straightforwardly achieved from eq.(2.8):

where

1(x,  ) = g1(x) + g2(x) cos 2sph

g1(x) = 
g2(x) =

h1g2[u0]

[h  l(2sph)]1g2[u0].

(2.10)

(2.11)

next order perturbation can be done by using

(x,  ) = au0(x) cos  + a21(x,  ) + a32(x,  ).

(2.12)

substituting eq.(2.12) into eq.(2.4) and neglecting terms of order a4 and higher, one gets

2(x,  ) = a3(l  h)1h(0)

2 cos  + (2)

(2.17)

before we derive a sucient condition for the sharp transition, it may be in order to

comment on the two kinds of eld theoretical tunneling models. one kind(case i) consists

of models which support localized vacuum instanton and sphaleron. the usual quantum

6

mechanical model and mws model plunge into this case. another kind(case ii) consists of

models which does not support localized vacuum instanton. the mw model and electroweak

theory are categorized in this case. the prototypes of action-vs-period picture for the rst-

order transition between quantum and thermal regimes in these cases are shown at fig. 1.

in both cases the rst-order transition occurs when  > sph, which results in

< u0 | f [u0] > > 0.

(2.18)

we will use this criterion to determine the types of transition in the full range of parameter

space in mws and mw models.

iii. fluctuation around sphaleron in mws model

the eld equation of mws model whose action is given at eq.(1.1) is easily derived by

introducing and subsequently removing a lagrange multiplier:

(ab  ab)hb + (bc

c)i = 2(a3  a3).

(3.1)

since skyrme term does not contribute to eld equation for static sphaleron [17], sphaleron

is same with that of mw model which is derived at ref. [13]:

where

sph = (sin sph, 0, cos sph)

sph = 2 sin1(sechx).

now, we introduce small uctuation elds u and v around sphaleron such as

 =

1

1 + u2

(sin(sph + v), u, cos(sph + v)) .

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

the expansion of eld equation (3.1) in terms of u and v is very tedious, but straightforward:

here, prime and dot mean dierentiation with respect to x and  respectively, and hu and

hv are

hu =

1

1 + 42sech2x "
2
x2 + 2(1  2sech2x).

hv = 

2

x2 + 2(1  6sech2x)#

(3.7)

it is interesting that skyrme term contributes only modication of hu, not hv. apart

from denominator in hu the eigenvalue equations of hu and hv are usual poschl-teller type

which can be solved completely [19]. the denominator in hu modies the spectrum which

will be discussed in next section.

iv. spectra of hu and hv

consider an eigenvalue equation of the usual poschl-teller type potential:

"

d2

dx2 + v (x)# n(x) = nn(x)

(4.1)

where

8

v (x) = 2 

v0

cosh2 x

.

(4.2)

it is well-known that eq.(4.1) has both nite discrete modes, whose number is dependent

on

s =

1

2 
1 +s1 +

4v0

2 
 ,

(4.3)

and continuum states. the spectrum and eigenfunctions are summarized as follows [19];

(1) discrete modes

n = 2[1  (s  n)2]

n!vuut
n(x) = r 

(1 + 2s  n)

(1 + s  n)(s  n)

 2f1(n, 1 + 2s  n; s  n + 1;

1
2

(1  tanh x))

(n = 0, 1,   , nmax < s)

(4.4)

2ns coshns x

(2) continuum modes

k = 2 + k2

k(x) =

 )

(1  tanh x)).

 2f1(s + 1,s; 1 

;

here, (a) and 2f1(a, b; c; z) are usual gamma and hypergeometric functions. since eigen-

value equation for hv, hvn(x) = v

nn(x), is exactly poschl-teller type equation, it is very

easy to nd its spectrum and eigenfunctions, which is summarized at table i.

now, let us consider eigenvalue equation of hu;

hun(x) = u

nn(x).

(4.6)

after rearranging eq.(4.6) one can show that it is possible to make it as usual poschl-teller

type provided the following explicit u

n-dependence of s is allowed ;

s =

1

2 (cid:20)q25 + 16u

n  1(cid:21) .

9

(4.7)

after eliminating u

n by using eq.(4.4) and (4.7) one can arrive at conclusion that dierent

s-value is assigned to each discrete mode,

sn =

(8n2  1) +q6424  16(n2 + n  7)2 + 25

2(1 + 42)

.

(4.8)

now, we can solve eq.(4.8) for non-negative integer n under requirements s > 0 and

s > n, which results in a fact that the number of discrete modes is dependent on 2. for
example, there are three discrete modes(n = 0, 1, 2) for 0 < 2  3/2. and, one more
discrete mode appears for 3/2 < 2  7/2. generally, there are n discrete modes for
(n1)2+(n1)6
. parameter-dependence of discrete spectrum is explicitly

4

< 2  n2+n6

4

shown at fig.2. it is worthwhile noting that n = 0 is negative mode and n = 1 is zero mode

which indicates that u is uctuation eld around unstable conguration.

the continuum spectrum of hu is more simple. if one follows the same procedure, it is

easy to show that continuum spectrum and correspondent eigenfunctions are exactly same

with those of eq.(4.5) provided s is replaced by

sk = 1 +q25 + 16(2 + k2)

2

.

(4.9)

table ii shows a complete spectrum of hu for 0 < 2 < 3/2.

v. criterion for first-order transition in mws model

in this section we will derive the criterion for the rst-order transition in mws model

by following gorokhov and blatter. to do a lowest order perturbation we choose a ansatz

cos sph

(5.1)

u

v







= a


u0(x)

v0(x)




where a is discussed at the below of eq.(2.5). inserting eq.(5.1) into eq.(3.5) and neglecting

terms of order higher than a2 we obtain

h


u0(x)

v0(x)




= l(sph)


u0(x)

v0(x)




10

(5.2)

where l() = 2. based on the analysis of sec. iv, it is easy to show that h has only

one negative mode whose eigenvalue and eigenfunction are u

,

0  1) and 


respectively. here, s0 is obtained from eq.(4.8) by letting n = 0;

0 = 2(s2

0(x)

0

s0 = q1 + 4(1 + 42)(6 + 42)  1

2(1 + 42)

.

hence, the lowest perturbation shows

0  1

sph = qs2
u0(x) = 0(x) = 2s0vuut

v0(x) = 0.

(1 + 2s0)

(s0)(1 + s0)

coshs0 x

now, let us start the next order perturbation by substituting




u(x,  )

v(x,  )




= 


au0(x) cos  + a2u1(x,  )

a2v1(x,  )




(5.3)

(5.4)

(5.5)

into eq.(3.5). as commented in sec.ii,  is the correction to the frequency sph. neglecting

higher order terms one arrives at the following equation:

u1(x,  )

v1(x,  )







= (l  h)1 ~1

where

~1 =

1
a

[l(sph)  l()]


u0(x) cos 

0




+


0

h1(x,  )

.




here, h1(x,  ) is

h1(x,  ) = 22s0 3(1 + 2s0)
(s0)(1 + s0)

sinh x

cosh2s0+2 x

h(4s0 + 1) cos2  + 22(sin2  + s0)i .

using same argument given at sec.ii, we need a condition

(5.6)

(5.7)

(5.8)

u0 cos 

0

~1 >= 0

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(5.9)

to escape an innity arised due to inversion of l  h. the condition (5.9) is automati-
cally satised if  = sph, which means there is no frequency shift in the present order of

perturbation.

before we go to next order, let us compute u1(x,  ) and v1(x,  ) explicitly. this is

achieved by direct calculation, which needs a tedious, but straightforward procedure:

(5.10)

(5.11)

(5.12)

(5.13)

u1(x,  ) = 0

v1(x,  ) = gv,1(x) + gv,2(x) cos 2sph

where

gv,1(x) = 22s0 3(1 + 2s0)

now, let us perform next order perturbation with




u(x,  )

v(x,  )




= 


au0(x) cos  + a3u2(x,  )

a2v1(x,  ) + a3v2(x,  )

.




after inserting eq.(5.12) into eq.(3.5) we obtain

u2(x,  )

v2(x,  )







= (l  h)1~2.

here, we do not need full explicit form of ~2 for the derivation of criterion for sharp

winding number transition. the only one we need is upper element in eq.(5.13), which is

u2(x,  ) = (l  hu)1u

2

(5.14)

where

u

1 + 42sech2x

[gu,1(x) cos  + gu,2(x) cos 3 ] .

(5.15)

in eq.(5.15) the explicit form of gu,2(x) is not needed also for the derivation of criterion.

the only one we need is gu,1(x) which is

gu,1(x) = 2s0  (1 + 2s0)

(s0)(1 + s0)!

(5.17)

in order to change eq.(5.17) to a more convenient form, we have to compute gv,1(x) and

gv,2(x) explicitly which is performed in appendix, where the following integral representa-

tions are obtained:

fig. 3 shows the result of numerical calculation of l()  l(sph) with respect to 2.
from fig. 3 we can conclude that mws model exhibits sharp rst order winding number

transition when 0 < 2 < 0.0399 and 2.148 < 2. ref. [18] shows rst order transition

when 2 = 0.001, which is in agreement with our conclusion. although gorokhov and

blatters method cannot determine the type of transition for 0.0399 < 2 < 2.148, it is

easily conjectured using 2s0/ssph which is shown in fig. 4, where s0 and ssph are vacuum

instanton and sphaleron actions, respectively. fig. 4 indicates that 2s0/ssph < 1 when

0 < 2 < 0.006 and 2.52 < 2, and 2s0/ssph > 1 when 0.006 < 2 < 2.52. hence, mws

model exhibits strong rst-order transition when 0 < 2 < 0.006 and 2.52 < 2, and

14

weak rst-order transition when 0.006 < 2 < 0.0399 and 2.148 < 2 < 2.52 as shown

in fig. 5. from this fact we can conjecture that smooth second order transition occurs at

intermediate region of 2.

vi. winding number transition in mw model

in this section we will discuss the winding number transition in mw model by taking

  0 limit in eq.(5.19). using integral formula [20]

transition in the full range of parameter space. this is in agreement with result of ref. [15].

vii. conclusion

in this paper we examine the winding number transition of the mw model with and

without skyrem term. for mws model we expand the eld equation around sphaleron

solution, which yields the explicit form of the uctuation operator. the spatial uctuation

operator is proven to be a kind of modied poschl-teller type and its number of discrete

modes is dependent on the value of 2. the increment of 2 gives rise to the increase of

the number of discrete modes, and eventually the innite number of discrete modes arises

as 2 approaches innity.

following gorokhov and blatter we derive the sucient condition for the sharp rst-order

transition in this model, which indicates that rst-order transition occurs when 0 < 2 <

0.0399 and 2.148 < 2. computing 2s0/ssph, we conjecture that the smooth second-order

transition occurs in the intermediate region of 2.

for mw model the criterion for the sharp transition can be easily derived by taking a

  0 limit to that of mws model.
rst-order winding number transition regardless of the value of parameter.

it is shown that the mw model always exhibits a

mw model is frequently used as a toy model of sphaleron transition for the electroweak

theory, and hence for the investigation of the baryon number violating processes. recent

study [21], however, on the sphaleron transition of su(2)-higgs theory [22] has shown that

smooth second-order sphaleron transition occurs when 6.665 < mh/mw < 12.03 although

rst-order transition occurs when mh /mw < 6.665. hence, mw model cannot play an

important role as a toy model for the study of sphaleron transition of electroweak theory

when higgs are very massive than w particle. this means we need another toy model

16

which exhibits a rst-order and second-order sphaleron transition depending on the values

of parameters involved in the model. based on our study on the relation of number of

negative modes and bifurcation point analyzed in ref. [12], we have an opinion that this

may be achieved by endowing a nontrivial topology to the space coordinate. this will be

discussed elsewhere.
