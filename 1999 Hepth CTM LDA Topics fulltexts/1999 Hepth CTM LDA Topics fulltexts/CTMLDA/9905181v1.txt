abstract

motivated by recent progress on the correspondence between string theory on anti-de
sitter space and conformal eld theory, we provide an explicit construction of an innite
dimensional class of superconformal algebras on the boundary of ads3. these space-time
algebras are n extended superconformal algebras of the kind obtainable by hamiltonian
reduction of ane sl(2|n/2) current superalgebras for n even, and are induced by
the same current superalgebras residing on the world sheet. thus, such an extended
superconformal algebra is generated by n supercurrents and an sl(n/2) current algebra
in addition to a u(1) current algebra. the results are obtained within the framework of
free eld realizations.

1 introduction

recently, maldacena proposed a duality between type iib string theory and (super-)
conformal eld theory (cft) on the boundary of anti-de sitter space (ads) [1], further
elaborated on in refs.
[2, 3]. this remarkable conjecture has induced a tremendous
activity in theoretical high energy physics. in the cases involving ads3, see e.g. refs.
[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], the corresponding space-time cft is two-dimensional and thus possesses
many well known properties.

the boundary of ads3 enjoys conformal symmetry, as recognized by brown and
henneaux [10]. in the work [6], giveon et al have constructed explicitly the generators
of the space-time conformal algebra from the string theory on ads3. the construction
starts from the world sheet sl(2) current algebra. in terms of the wakimoto free eld
realization [11] of that, they have provided a general expression for the virasoro generators
and computed the central charge.

in ref. [12] ito has succeeded in constructing superconformal algebras on the bound-
ary of ads3 and again the construction starts from a world sheet current algebra. how-
ever, in order to obtain an extended conformal symmetry in space-time one needs to
consider higher world sheet current (super-)algebras than sl(2). thus, ito has found
that the appropriate lie superalgebras leading to n = 1, 2 and 4 superconformal alge-
bras are osp(1|2), sl(2|1) and sl(2|2), respectively. the explicit constructions are based
on generalized wakimoto free eld realizations of the associated ane current superal-
gebras [13, 14, 15]. a related approach to construct n = 1, 2 and 4 superconformal
algebras is discussed in [16] in which also one- and two-point functions and some unitary
representations are considered. in ref.
[17] space-time n = 3 superconformal theories
are studied.

the objective of the present paper is to take a rst step in the direction of classifying
the superconformal algebras that may be induced by string theory on ads3, thus gen-
eralizing the work by ito [12]. a main property of an appropriate world sheet current
(super-)algebra is that the bosonic part may be decomposed as g = sl(2)  g. this is
necessary as we want the free elds in the wakimoto realization of the embedded sl(2)
to be considered as coordinates on ads3. as discussed in ref. [6], a purely bosonic world
sheet algebra with such a decomposition leads immediately to an ane lie algebra on the
boundary of ads3. the present paper is devoted to discussing the class of superconformal
algebras that may be constructed starting from ane sl(2|n/2) current superalgebras
having as bosonic part sl(2)  sl(n/2)  u(1). by construction, n is even. it is an
interesting observation that the resulting algebras are equivalent to the ones obtained
by hamiltonian reduction of the same ane current superalgebras, see e.g. [18]. indeed,
for n  4 the superconformal algebra is generated by n supercurrents and an sl(n/2)
current algebra in addition to a u(1) current algebra. for n = 2, the sl(n/2) and
u(1) current algebras collapse to a single u(1) current algebra. this conventional n = 2
superconformal algebra has already been obtained by ito, though his construction of the
n = 2 and n = 4 algebras relies on slightly dierent free eld realizations of the world
sheet current superalgebras than the ones employed in the present paper, thus producing
slightly dierent realizations of the superconformal algebras.

a complete classication along the lines indicated is reached when the superconformal

1

algebras induced by any world sheet current superalgebra with sl(2) g decomposable
bosonic part have been constructed. we anticipate that the techniques employed in the
present paper may be enhanced to cover the general case and hope to come back elsewhere
with a discussion on this generalization.

as pointed out in ref.

[6], brst invariance of the construction of the space-time
conformal algebra is equivalent to requiring the virasoro generators to be primary elds
of weight one with respect to the world sheet energy-momentum tensor. this carries
over to the superconformal case, and we shall verify that the generators of our explicitly
constructed superconformal algebras meet the requirement of being primary of weight
one with respect to the world sheet current superalgebra sugawara tensor.

the algebras constructed in ref.

[16] are simpler than the ones by ito as they are
based on smaller lie superalgebras. for example, the n = 4 superconformal algebra is
constructed from an sl(2|1) lie superalgebra. however, the central charges are essentially
xed, and the algebras are not ensured to be brst invariant.
the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we review the
construction of the virasoro algebra and the immediate extension to an ane lie algebra
[6].

in section 3 we introduce our notation for lie superalgebras and their associated
current superalgebras, and review the free eld realizations of the latter obtained in ref.
[15].

in section 4 we provide our explicit construction of the superconformal algebras and

verify their brst invariance.

section 5 contains concluding remarks, whereas particulars on the lie superalgebra

sl(2|m) are deferred to appendix a.

2 virasoro algebra

the standard wakimoto free eld realization of the ane sl(2) current algebra with
level k [11] is

e = 

h = 2 + k + 2
f = 2 + k + 2 + k

(1)

here and throughout the paper, normal ordering is implicit. the operator product ex-
pansions (opes) of the ghost elds ,  and the bosonic scalar eld  are

(z)(w) =

1

z  w

,

(z)(w) = 2 ln(z  w)

(2)

where regular terms have been omitted.
sl(2) current algebra with level k induces the virasoro algebra

in ref.

[6] it is shown that the world sheet

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m +

c
12

(n3  n)n+m,0

on the boundary of ads3. the generators are given by

ln = i dz
ln = a+(n)n+1e + a3(n)nh + a(n)n1f

2iln(z)

with constants1

a+(n) =

a(n) =

the central charge is found to be

brst invariance requires ln to be conformal primary of weight 1 with respect to the

world sheet virasoro generator

t =  +

(8)

this property is readily veried.

the virasoro algebra is immediately extended to an ane lie algebra if the world
sheet ane sl(2) current algebra is replaced by an ane g = sl(2)g current algebra,
where g is a lie group. indeed, let ja denote the currents of the ane g current algebra
with central extension k, and dene the generators

ia,n = i dz

2i

n(z)ja(z)

(9)

(10)

from the dening ope

ja(z)jb(w) =

a,bk

(z  w)2 +

where a,b and fa,b
of the underlying lie algebra g, one nds

c are the cartan-killing form and the structure constants, respectively,

[ln, ib,m] = mib,n+m
[ia,n, ib,m] = fa,b

cic,n+m + npka,bn+m,0

(11)

summation over properly repeated indices is implicit. the central extension kp of the
space-time ane lie algebra generated by {ia,n} is seen to be the one, k, of the world
sheet g current algebra multiplied by the winding number p of the embedded sl(2)
subalgebra. as the currents ja are spin one primary elds, the construction is readily
seen to be brst invariant due to the decomposition sl(2)  g.

1note that the conventions used here dier slightly from the ones used in ref.

[6], which is also

reected in a sign discrepancy in the central charge (6).

3.1 lie superalgebra

let g0 and g1 denote the even and odd parts, respectively, of the lie superalgebra g
[19] and references therein.  = 0  1 is the set of roots 
of rank r, see ref.
of g where 0 (1) is the set of even (odd) roots. the set of positive roots  > 0
is + = 0
+. a choice of simple roots is written {i}i=1,...,r. a distinguished
representation is characterized by exactly one simple root being odd. related to the
triangular decomposition

(12)
the raising and lowering operators are denoted e, j  g+ and f, j  g, respec-

most lie superalgebras with even subalgebra g0 = sl(2)  g have the property that
the embedding of sl(2) in g carried by g1 is a spin 1/2 representation2. this means that
the space of odd roots may be divided into two parts
1 = 1  1+

(25)

sl(2) is the positive root associated to the embedded sl(2). in particular, the division
(23) is present in the case of our main interest, namely the lie superalgebra sl(2|m)
which is considered in section 4 and further in appendix a.

2this is true for all basic lie superalgebras with even subalgebra g

where the embedding is a spin 1 representation, see e.g. [18].

3.2 free field realization

associated to a lie superalgebra is an ane lie superalgebra characterized by the central

we use the same notation j, e, f, h for the currents as for the algebra generators. hope-
fully, this will not lead to misunderstandings. the associated sugawara construction

4 superconformal algebra

in this section we shall construct the superconformal algebra in space-time that may be
induced by the ane sl(2|n/2) current superalgebra on the world sheet. for simplicity,
we consider the underlying lie superalgebra sl(2|n/2) in the distinguished representation,
see appendix a. let us introduce the abbreviations  = 1, e1 = e1 etc for the objects
related to the embedded sl(2). hopefully, no misunderstandings will arise, as we are also
using  to represent a general bosonic ghost eld argument in the polynomials v and p ,
though in general we will leave out the arguments.

using the explicit polynomials

v 1
1 (, c) = 1
v 1
1 (, c) = 2
v 1
1(, c) = 2

it is straightforward to verify that the virasoro algebra (3) is generated by

ln = i dz
ln = a+(n)n+1e1 + a3(n)nh1 + a(n)n1f1

2iln(z)

and has central charge

c = 6k

(45)

(46)

p1 is the winding number (7) for the ghost eld 1 = , and k
of the embedded sl(2) or the level in the direction 1.

1 = 1,1k is the level

as a preparation for constructing the algebra generators, let us introduce the gener-

ators

here and in the following summations over repeated indices are implicit. summations over
root indices are meant to be over all positive roots if not otherwise indicated. actually,
this restriction is not necessary as the triangular coordinates are dened for positive
roots only, i.e.  exists only for  > 0. now, due to the structure of the root space (see
appendix a) we immediately obtain

[ln, j,0] = 0 for   0 \ {1}

likewise, it follows that

[ln, j,0] =

[ln, j+,0] =

2

2

(n  1)n ((n + 1)j,n  nj+,n+1)
(n + 1)n1 (nj,n1  (n  1)j+,n)

(49)

(50)

the idea is to use the right hand sides in the construction of the supercurrents. to this
end let us consider the general setting where a primary eld  of weight h

[ln, m+] = ((h  1)n  m  ) n+m+

may be obtained as a commutator of the form

(cid:20)lm,i b(cid:21) = b(m; ; h)m+

(51)

(52)

 is a possible non-integer shift in the modes, whereas b is some function. from the
jacobi identities this function satises the recursion relation

(n  m)b(n + m) = ((h  1)n  m  )b(m)  ((h  1)m  n  )b(n)

(53)

allowing the simple solution

b(n) = b0 + b1n ,

(1  h)b0 = b1

(54)

this is precisely of the form we have encountered in (50). since we want to construct
supercurrents of weight 3/2 we should choose  =  1

2 , and we dene the generators

g,n+1/2 = i dz
g,n+1/2 = (n + 1)nj  nn+1j+

2ig,n+1/2(z)

9

(55)

of course, it still remains to verify that the supercurrents g are indeed primary:

[ln, g,m+1/2] = (cid:18)1

2

n  m 

1

2(cid:19) g,n+m+1/2

(56)

however, that follows immediately from the simple computation of the ope lng,m+1/2,
and we have thus constructed half of the supercurrents. note that both commutators in
(50) lead to the same supercurrent as we have

g,n+1/2 = 


2
n1 [ln, j,0]

2
n+2 [ln+1, j+,0]

(57)

this means that g may be represented as a commutator for all integer modes n.

let us now turn to the construction of the supercurrents g. for a =   1

follows from (48) that a situation like (57) occurs provided

 it

+ = v 1
v 1



(58)

this important relation is proven in appendix a where also some identities involving
v 1
 are derived. we are led to dene the supercurrents g by
g,n1/2 = i dz
g,n1/2 = (n  1)nj + nn1j+

2ig,n1/2(z)

1(cid:17) v 1

(59)

where

as indicated in (59), one may show that the upper root index  is always an (positive)
odd root. the analogue to (57) reads


1 = 2v

(60)

g,n1/2 = 


2
n+1 [ln, j,0]

2
n2 [ln1, j+,0]

(61)

as in the case of the supercurrents g, there is a free overall scaling. however, in order
to produce the conventional prefactor of plus one multiplying the virasoro generator in
the anti-commutator ng, go (see (73)), the relative factor is xed.

before proving that g is a primary eld of weight 3/2

n  m +

2(cid:19) g,n+m1/2

(62)

let us observe the following property of the construction. consider the jacobi identity

[j,0, [ln, j,0]] + [ln, [j,0, j,0]] = [j,0, [ln, j,0]] = 0

(63)

where   0 \ {1} is any even (positive or negative) root dierent from 1. from
the construction of g and g it follows that3

g,n+1/2 = hj,0, g,n+1/2i
g,n1/2 = hj,0, g,n1/2i

for     0 \ {1}
for     0 \ {1}

here we have used that

f,



= f,



= 1 for     0 \ {1}

(64)

(65)

besides providing information on the underlying algebraic structure of our construc-
tion, the translational property (64) may be used to reduce considerations for general
supercurrents to similar ones for the supercurrents g2,n+1/2 and in particular g2,n1/2.
2 is the only fermionic simple root, see appendix a. thus, as a rst application we shall
prove that g is primary. from the jacobi identities we nd

[ln, g,m1/2] = [j2,0, [ln, g2,m1/2]]

leaving us with the task of proving that g2 is primary. to that end we work out

v 1
2 = 2

1 =

(66)

(67)

where c and c are the fermionic ghost elds associated to the odd roots 2 and 1 + 2,
respectively, and the supercurrent becomes

this concludes the proof of (62) that g is primary of weight 3/2.

3subtleties for n = 1,2 are immediately resolved by the alternative commutator representations

(57) and (61).

4.1 closure of algebra

here we shall discuss the closure of the superconformal algebra by rst studying the
anti-commutator of two supercurrents. it is readily seen that

whereas it follows from the translational property and the jacobi identities that

ng,n+1/2, g,m+1/2o = 0

ng,n1/2, g,m1/2o = 0

(71)

(72)

a rather cumbersome but essentially straightforward computation reveals that

ng,n+1/2, g,m1/2o = ,ln+m+(nm+1)k,,n+m+
where the current k is dened by

1

cn(n+1)n+m,0,

(74)

there are several ways of representing k,,n of which the following two turn out to
be useful

in particular, they may be used in a straightforward verication that the current k is
primary of weight 1:

before discussing the commutator of k with a supercurrent, let us note the transla-

[ln, k,,m] = mk,,n+m

(76)

tional property

[j,0, k,,n] = k+,,n + k,(),n ,

  0 \ {1}

(77)

here we have used (49) and the translational properties of g and g. the notation
implies that either term on the right hand side vanishes identically if  +  / 1 or
   / 1, respectively.

we want to compute the commutators

[k,,n, g,m+1/2] ,

[k,,n, g,m1/2]

(78)

k,,n =

(75)

n+1 (cid:16)ng,n+1/2, g,1/2o  ,ln(cid:17)
n1 (cid:16)ng,1/2, g,n1/2o  ,ln(cid:17)

using concatenations of the jacobi identities, the primary properties (56), (62) and (76),
and the translational properties (64) and (77), one may reduce the problem to one of
computing

hk,,0, g2,1/2i = 
1
2

hk,,0, g2,1/2i =

,g2,1/2 + ,2g,1/2

1
2
,g2,1/2  ,2g,1/2

inserting these results in the concatenations leads to

hk,,n, g,m+1/2i = 
1
hk,,n, g,m1/2i =
2

1
2
,g,n+m1/2  ,g,n+m1/2
based on these it is not dicult to work out the commutator of two k currents:

,g,n+m+1/2 + ,g,n+m+1/2

this completes in principle the derivation of the superconformal algebra as closure is
ensured by (71), (72), (73), (80) and (81) (in addition to (3), (45) and the primary
properties (56), (62) and (76)). nevertheless, we would like to add a few comments on
the algebraic structure generated by the k currents.

the number of k currents is

|1

+ |2 = n 2/4 = dim(sl(2|n/2)) + 1

and in order to show that this reects the structure

sl(2|n/2)  u(1)

(82)

(83)

let us introduce the following notation. from appendix a we know that any root  
1
+ may be represented as 2  u for some u = 1, ..., n/2, so abbreviate k by

ku,v,n = k2u,(2v),n

note also that v  u > 0 for u > v. dene now
ei,n = ki+1,i,n
hi,n = ki+1,i+1,n  ki,i,n
fi,n = ki,i+1,n

(84)

(85)

where i = 1, ..., n/2  1 by construction. one may then show that these correspond to
the chevalley generators of an ane sl(n/2) lie algebra with level

k
sl(n/2) =

1
6

c

13

(86)

in general, the currents ku,v,n correspond to raising operators for u > v, and to lowering
operators for u < v.

furthermore, the generator

un =

n/2

xu=1

ku,u,n

(87)

is seen to commute with all ladder operators ku,v6=u,n and with the cartan generators
hi, and to satisfy

(88)

(89)

[un, um] =

cnn+m,0n(1  n/4)

1
12

thus, u generates a u(1) current algebra with level

ku (1) =

1
12

cn(1  n/4)

this concludes the verication of the decomposition (83) of the bosonic part of the
superconformal algebra.

finally, let us note that

hun, g,m+1/2i = (1  n/4)g,n+m+1/2
hun, g,m1/2i = (1  n/4)g,n+m1/2

(90)

showing that precisely for n = 4 the u(1) current also commutes with the supercurrents.

4.2 brst invariance

as pointed out in ref. [6], brst invariance of the construction of the space-time confor-
mal algebra from a world sheet sl(2) current algebra requires the virasoro generators to
be primary elds of weight one with respect to the world sheet energy-momentum tensor.
this carries over to the superconformal case, where the requirement is that all currents
(the virasoro generators l, the supercurrents g and g, and the ane lie algebra genera-
tors k) are primary of weight one with respect to the sugawara energy-momentum tensor
of the world sheet sl(2|n/2) current superalgebra. a naive inspection immediately tells
that all four types of currents have weight one, so all we need to verify is that they are
primary. this amounts to verifying that third and higher order poles in the opes with
the sugawara tensor t all vanish. from the free eld realization of t it follows that no
higher order poles than third order appears. using that the ane currents j are primary
elds, the brst invariance of the supercurrents g is readily conrmed as v 1
 = 0. the
brst invariance of the virasoro generators l follows from (44), whereas the invariance
of the supercurrents g amounts to verifying

0 = n(n  1)n1v 1

 + n(n  1)n2v 1

 n(n  1)v 1

the three lines vanish separately due to (58), (44) and (108), respectively. likewise,
brst invariance of the ane lie algebra generators k amounts to verifying

5 conclusion

we have provided an explicit construction of space-time n extended superconformal alge-
bras on the boundary of ads3. the algebras are induced by free eld realizations of ane
sl(2|n/2) current superalgebras on the world sheet, where n is even, thus generalizing
recent work by ito on n = 1, 2 and 4 superconformal algebras [12]. the result oers
new (and stringy) representations of superconformal algebras which are linear in the
currents. this suggests that they may be useful when discussing representation theoret-
ical questions, and in the computation of correlation functions. many other applications
may be envisaged.

several classes of lie supergroups enjoy decompositions of the bosonic part g =
sl(2) g as in the case of sl(2|n/2). based on their associated current superalgebras,
we anticipate that other classes of superconformal algebras may be constructed along the
lines employed in the present paper. this is currently being investigated.

this fact is used in deriving (49). however, root strings from  to 1 do exist. they
are of the form

  + ... + (2  u) + 1 = 1
 + ... + (1  u) = 1

where root strings from + are obtained by inserting an additional 1:

 + + ... + 1 + ... + (2  u) + 1 = 1
+ + ... + (2  u) + 1 + 1 = 1
+ + ... + 1 + ... + (1  u) = 1
+ + ... + (1  u) + 1 = 1

and compare the two polynomials in order to derive the relation (58). this we do by
considering 1
+. there are two cases, as such
terms involve either c1u or c2u for some u, and we will discuss them separately. in
the rst case the relevant root strings are the lower one in (100) and the two lower ones
in (101). their dierences are characterized by the structure constants

(n+1)! (c)n+1 in v 1

now, each time the situation (103) occurs in 1

a similar analysis of the terms involving c2u leads to the characterizations

contributes with a factor 2, the terms involving c2u also agree with the relation (58),
which thus is proven.

and 0 otherwise. particularly useful are the following relations
