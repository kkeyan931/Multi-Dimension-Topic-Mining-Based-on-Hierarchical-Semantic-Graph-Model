abstract

we argue that yang-mills theory on noncommutative torus, expressed in the four-

rier modes, is described by a gauge theory in a usual commutative space, the gauge

group being a generalization of the area preserving dieomorphisms to the noncom-

mutative case. in this way, performing the loop calculations in this gauge theory in

the continuum limit, we show that this theory is renormalizable, and discuss the uv

and ir limits. the moduli space of the vacua of the noncommutative super yang-mills

theories in 2+1 dimensions is discussed.

1 introduction

it has been pointed out by a. connes, m. douglas and a. schwarz (cds) [1] that the

supersymmetric yang-mills theory (sym) on noncommutative torus (nct), is naturally

related to compactication of matrix theory with a constant c3 eld. since the eleven
dimensional three-form ux is related to the nsns two-form ux in string theory, cdss

conjecture means that the dynamics of d-branes in a b-eld background is described by

gauge theory on a noncommutative torus, where the b-eld gives the deformation parameter

of the torus, in the zero volume limit [2,3,4,5,6,7,8].

the noncommutative torus (nct) is a basically at and compact space in which the

coordinates do not commute:

[xi, xj] =

ij
2i

.

(1.1)

in this paper we mostly consider the two-torus and hence in our case the nct is described

by only one parameter  which is called deformation parameter of the torus [9].

it was rst explicitly shown in [4], completed and generalized in [7,10], that the above

commutation relation naturally appears for the components of open strings attached to

d-brane in the b-eld background. further study on these open string dynamics and quan-

tizing them revealed that their low energy dynamics is governed by the noncommutative

supersymmetric yang-mills (ncsym) theory dened on the nct [2,11].

since ncsym describes the low energy interactions of open strings at which it is decou-

pled from string theory dynamics and some special limits of m-theory, it is believed that

ncsym should be a well-dened quantum theory [1,11,12]. but, as pointed out in many

papers e.g.

[1,2,13,14], ncsym is a non-local eld theory, where the non-locality scale is

identied with the deformation parameter of the torus which is a dimensionless parameter

and hence this non-locality is expected to remain at all energies; and the question of renor-

malizability, renormalization ow and existence of xed points of the non-local eld theories

has not been answered yet. existence of a uv xed point, in which the theory is scale

invariant, is one of the elements that make a usual eld theory, e.g. a gauge theory, work.

using this xed point, we are able to dene the theory in the continuum limit, but in the

ncsym, since it is a non-local eld theory, the concept of renormalization and xed points

should be understood and studied in some other sense.

in this paper, rst we briey review the algebraic structure of nct and the gauge

bundles dened on it, and discuss the morita equivalence between sections of these bundles

on dierent tori. this equivalence enables us to map a u(n) ncsym with magnetic ux

m to a u(1) ncsym. so, having studied the u(1) ncsym, we can discuss the u(n) case

2

on the same footing.

in section 3, by using the fourrier transformation on the nct, we map the u(1) ncsym

to a conventional commutative gauge theory, with a gauge group which is a generalization
of the area-preserving dieomorphisms of the two-torus, sdi(t 2), to the noncommutative
case. we extensively study the propagators and vertices of this gauge theory.

in section 4, performing the explicit loop calculations we show that, the related diver-

gences are like a usual gauge theory, in which the quadratic casimir of the group, c2(g), is
2.

in section 5, we argue that ncym in uv and ir limits behaves as in a usual gauge

theories. in other words, although ncym is a non-local theory, the theory is renormalizable

and it admits a uv xed point. we also briey discuss the moduli space of vacua and

r-symmetries of ncsym, as a theory with 16 real super-charges.

finally in section 6, we will summarize our results and discuss some open and unanswered

issues on this problem.

2 noncommutative yang-mills theory, a review

in order to build the ym theory on a noncommutative torus, we briey review the necessary

ingredients from noncommutative geometry. for an extensive reference, we refer the reader

to connes book [9].

gauge bundles on noncommutative torus
noncommutative geometry begins by making a dual map from a manifold to the c -algebra
of its functions. in the case of noncommutative two-torus, the related c -algebra can be
generated by the fourrier modes: ui = e2ixi

, i = 1, 2, where

u1u2 = e2iu2u1.

(2.1)

or equivalently

[x1, x2] = 

2i . the same algebra can also be generated by the star product

among these functions:

(f  g)(x) = exp(iij 
xi


yj )f (x)g(y)|y=x.

(2.2)

in the above denitions  is the deformation parameter of the nct. we also need a set of

derivatives i, which satisfy

[i, j] = 0

,

[i, xj] = j
i .

(2.3)

3

gauge bundles, are dened as modules over the c -algebra of functions and can be realized
with the connection, i, satisfying:

i(ca) = (ic)a + cia,

(2.4)

where c  c  , a projective (right)-module over c . according to (2.4) the gauge connec-
tion commutes with all of the functions in c  and hence it is not a function of noncommu-
tative xi, but there is a combination of xi, j [8],

xi = xi +

i
2

ijj,

(2.5)

which do commute with xi and the gauge bundles and the related gauge transformations
should be a function of xi:

and the gauge elds x, can be expanded by fourrier modes ui = e2ixi

;

i = i + iai(x),

u1 u2 = e2i u2 u1.

(2.6)

(2.7)

although up to here, we have discussed only the u(1) bundles, the u(n) generalization is

trivially possible, by simply letting a take values in the corresponding lie-algebra.

it is interesting to construct the parallel string theoretic description of the mathematics

we have built here. according to witten [15], the zero modes of the open strings attached

to a d-brane form a gauge multiplet of the u(1) theory living on the brane, and these gauge

elds are functions of the center of mass coordinates of the corresponding open strings. in

the presence of a non-zero b-eld background, in spite of the noncommutative coordinates,

this is still valid. to see this let us consider the mode expansion of such open strings [7,10,11]

x i = xi + pi  bi

jpj + oscil. i, j = 1, 2,

(2.8)

where pi are the related momentums and xi are an arbitrary point on the tours. quantizing
these open strings, we nd:

[pi, pj] = 0 ,

[pi, xj] = ij

i

,

[xi, xj] = ibij.

(2.9)

in the above algebra pi can be represented by ii. the center of mass coordinates of
these open strings which form the corresponding gauge multiplet is xi (2.5).

following t hooft, we can construct the non-abelian u(n) gauge bundles with a non-

zero magnetic ux m 2. consider u(n) matrices:

v1v2 = e2i m

n v2v1.

(2.10)

2we assume m, n that are relatively prime.

4

the generalization of ui, the fourrier expansion basis, to this case can be obtained by zi:

z1 = e

2i
n

x1

v k
2

, z2 = e

2i

n +m 

x2

v k

1

,

where k is an integer satisfying n l  m k = 1, l  z. one can easily check that

z1z2 = e2iz2z1 ,  =

k + l
n + m 

.

along the lines of [8], we can build the gauge connection through zi:

exp0

1 = e1v1z m

2

, exp0

2 = e2e2i m

n x1

v2z m
1 ,

and

i = 0

i + iai(z).

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

the most important feature of the above gauge bundle construction is the morita equivalence,

which is a mathematical equivalence between the bundles on the dierent noncommutative
tori. comparing (2.11) and (2.1), we see that both ui and zi generate the same type of
algebra; the corresponding deformation parameters are related by an sl(2,z) transformation,
(2.12). hence, we can identify the non-abelian gauge eld a, with an abelian one, a, which
lives on another nct dened by . this equivalence between the gauge bundles on dierent
noncommutative tori, is called morita equivalence.

in writing the explicit form of the ncsym, we prefer to use the algebra of functions

dened by star product, (2.2). according to cds [1], the noncommutative u(1) gauge

connection can be built by

with

i = i + i{ai,

}m.b.

{f, g}m.b.(x) = (f  g)(x)  (g  f )(x)

= 2if (x) sin (iij


i


j)g(y)|y=x.

the curvature is

(2.15)

(2.16)

f = [, ] = [a] + i{a, a}m.b.  = 0, 1, 2.

(2.17)

then u(1) ncym (on r  t 2

 ) is given by

s =

1
g2
y m

z d3x f f .

(2.18)

5

the above action enjoys the gauge invariance:

a  a +  + i{, a}m.b.

(2.19)

we can also supersymmetrize this action by adding the correct fermionic and scalar degrees

of freedom [5,16]. the maximally supersymmetric action which has 16 real super-charges is

of the form:

s = 1
g2

y m r d3x ff   2g2

y m (x a)(x a) + 2g4

y m ({x a, x b}m.b.)2

(2.20)

2i

 + 1

4 gy m a

.{xa, }m.b.,

where ,  = 0, 1, 2, a, b = 3, ..., 9 and

x a = x a + {a, x a}m.b.,

i = i + {ai, }m.b..

the above action is a d = 10, n = 1 non-abelian yang-mills theory, dimensionally reduced

to 2+1, with the group commutators substituted for the moyal bracket.

it is worth noting that, to our knowledge, there are few theories which admit the max-

imally supersymmetric extension, i.e. 16 real super-charges. among these theories, those

with at most two derivatives are all dimensional reductions of ten dimensional sym [17].

the other example of these theories are born-infeld actions. despite lack of lorentz invari-

ance and higher derivative terms, ncsym theories have a supersymmetric extension, and

this property supports the renormalizability of these theories. even these theories, like the

sym theories, satisfy the non-renormalization theorem, i.e. they are nite.

for the rational  case, as we discussed earlier, the ncsym, by means of morita equiva-

lence, is mapped to a conventional u(n) sym theory with a magnetic ux, which we know

is renormalizable. for the general real , we will show that by mapping the theory to the

momentum space, we can analyze and study it in the conventional perturbative gauge theory

language.

3 ncsym in the momentum space

although ncsym has been argued to be a non-local eld theory [2,12,13] with the non-

locality scale remaining at all scales, we want to build another formulation of the theory

6

in which the theory looks like a usual gauge theory. remembering (2.3) or string theoretic

version of it (2.9), one observes that expressing the ncym in the i or momentum basis,
or equivalently in the fourrier modes, formally removes the higher derivative terms already

present in the moyal bracket.

to see this explicitly, let us consider the fourrier expansion of the gauge eld a(x) [5],

a(x) = xk

a(~k)l~k,

(3.1)

where ~k is a vector on the dual commutative torus, dened in the usual manner, i.e. assume
that  is set to zero and dualize the torus, and l~k are the expansion basis,

l~k = eiki xi

.

(3.2)

in order to analyze the ncym theory rst we study the algebra dened by l~k

[l ~m, l~n] = {l ~m, l~n}m.b. = 2i sin ( ~m  ~n)l ~m+~n,

(3.3)

with ~m  ~n = ijminj.

for the rational  case, e.g.  = 1

n , by choosing the proper normalization for l ~m, the

above algebra is

[l ~m, l~n] = 2i

n


sin (


n

~m  ~n)l ~m+~n.

(3.4)

in the large n limit (3.4) is nothing but, the area-preserving dieomorphism algebra of a usual
torus, sdi(t 2), which is identied with su() [16]. this is a rather simple justication of
the matrix model m2-brane dynamics correspondence [18]. for the general rational , one
can check that for  = q
n , (3.4) again holds but mi, ni are dened mod qn and it represents a
subgroup of su() [1,16]. in the irrational  case, however the situation is a little dierent,

in this case (3.3) can not be mapped to any subgroup of su().

indeed (3.3) can be thought as the generalization of sdi(t 2) to the nct, sdi(t 2

 ).
in the usual geometric language, sdi(t 2) is the set of the dieomorphisms keeping the
kahler structure of the torus unchanged,  = iv , v the volume of the torus. in a more

general case we know that the kahler structure can have a real part:  = iv + b, and as

recently discussed [4,7,8,11,12,19], at least in the zero volume limit, b which in the string

theory language is the background b-eld ux, identied with the deformation parameter

of the torus, . one can show that under the transformations generated by (3.3) algebra 

is invariant. this fact supports arguments of [7,8] about the u-duality group of string and

brane theory with a non-zero b-eld. furthermore, (3.3) for the irrational  can be treated

7

as the area-preserving dieomorphism algebra of the nct, sdi(t
the gauge theory action
now, we imply (3.1) in writing the action (2.18) in momentum space in terms of l~k and
fourrier modes. here we perform calculations with the non-supersymmetric action, its gen-

2).

eralization to the supersymmetric case, obtained from (2.20), is like the usual gauge theories,

thus we only quote the results.

plugging (3.1) into the (2.17), we have

f = x~k

ik[a](k)l~k + 2i x~m,~n

sin( ~m  ~n)a(m)a(n)l ~m+~n

(3.5)

and hence the action of the u(1) ncym, (2.18), in fourrier modes is:

s = 1
g2

y m p~k(k[a](k))(k[a](k))+

2p ~m,~n,~k k[a](k) sin( ~m  ~n)a(m)a(n)( ~m + ~n + ~k)+

(3.6)

4p ~m,~n,~k,~l sin( ~m  ~n) sin(~k  ~l)a(m)a(n)a(k)a(l)( ~m + ~n + ~k + ~l).

in writing the above action we have implied the reality condition of the elds, a(k) =
a
(k). the above action is of the form of the usual gauge theories in which group indices
are identied with the momentum, the structure constants f ~m,~n,~k are

f ~m,~n,~k = 2 sin( ~m  ~n)( ~m + ~n + ~k)

(3.7)

as we see the momentum conservation condition is automatically taken into account by the

above structure constants. the important feature of this gauge theory is gauge invariance,

(2.19), which enables us to handle the problem of renormalizability without caring about

the non-locality of the theory.

noting the (3.7) and the action (3.6), we see that in this gauge theory our momentum
dependent coupling is sin( ~m ~n), which is smaller than one, hence we hope that the usual

perturbative eld theory methods, despite the momentum dependence of the couplings, work

here.

another point to mention here is the broken lorentz invariance of (2+1) dimensional

space. as it is seen from the action the couplings are a function of the spatial momentum

only, which explicitly breaks the lorentz invariance. the gauge xing condition removes the

subtleties related to the lack of lorentz invariance. we will show later that, this lorentz

non-invariance due to the special form of the interactions will not destroy our perturbative

8

calculations and is consistent with the gauge invariance at least, at one loop. moreover we

can nd a ward identity for this gauge theory.

before going to the details of loop calculations, let us study the structure of the algebra

dened by (3.3) and the related gauge theory, ncym:

a) all the l ~m with parallel ~m are commuting.
b) the only generator which commutes with all the others is l~0, so rank of the group is

one and the related cartaan sub-algebra is u(1).

c) in the usual non-abelian gauge theories, the gauge particles are charged under the

cartan sub-algebra, in our case since the cartan is u(1), the gauge particles are dipoles

under the sub-algebra [19], and the corresponding dipole moments are proportional to their

momentum but always normal to it and parallel dipoles are non-interacting.

d) because the momentum is conserved in each vertex, here we have the dipole moment

conservation.

e) from the string theory point of view [19], these dipoles are lowest modes of the strings

attached to a d2-brane in a b-eld background.

f) the high energy dipole-dipole scattering is suppressed by the moyal bracket structure.

perturbative tools

to do the calculations we need to read o the propagators and interaction vertices from the

action (3.6). for further details we refer the reader to [20].

9

4 loop calculations and renormalization

in this section, in order to discuss the renormalizability, -function behaviour of the theory

and its uv and ir limits, we explicitly calculate the one loop diagrams of the ncym. for

simplicity, we take the continuum limit and instead of summation we use integrals. the

theory is supposed to have a well-dened continuum limit [13].

loop calculations

1) the dipoles self energy part:

it gets contributions from four diagrams, dipole-loop, dipoles tadpole-loop, ghost-loop and

the counter-term [20].

1-1) dipole-loop:

(k) =

1

2 z

d3q
(2)3

1

q2(q + k)2

a(2 sin(~k  ~q))2,

(4.1)

with

a = (q2 + (q + k)2 + 4k2)g + 6qq + 3(qk + q k)  3kk.

(4.2)

it is worth noting that, in the case of ncym theories, unlike the usual loop calculations,

since the theory is not lorentz invariant, we can not use the wick rotation method. to

perform the loop integrals, since there is no q0 dependence in the vertex functions, rst we
integrate over the q0 component by taking the residue of q0 poles. the remaining integrals
are of the form:

(k) =

4

2 z qdqd
(2)3 [

a|q0=|q|

(k2 + 2kq cos )



a|q0=|q|

(k2  2kq cos )

] sin(kq sin )2,

(4.3)

before performing the integration over , we note that

sin2(kq sin ) =

1
2



1
2

cos(2kq sin ).

the cosine part can be expanded in terms of bessel functions [21]. it is a straightforward,

but messy calculation to show that all the terms containing bessel functions are nite, and
the only divergent part comes from the 1
2 term of the sine squared. so, to nd the divergent
part of the integral it is enough to substitute the sine squared in (4.1) for 1
in other
2.
words, the divergent part of (4.1) has exactly the form of the usual su(n) ym theory with
c2(g) = 4  1
2. furthermore, the divergent part of (4.1) is lorentz invariant and can be
calculated by wick rotation.

1-2) dipole tadpole- and ghost- loops:

using the method explained earlier, i.e. integrating on q0 component and expanding the sine

10

squared in terms of bessel functions, one can show that the divergent part of these diagrams,
like the dipole-loop case gets contributions only from putting the sine squared equal to 1
2 ,
which again restores the lorentz invariance of the theory.

so altogether the dipole self energy part, is renormalized like a usual local gauge theory,

with c2(g) = 2. the other important result is that although the interactions introduced by
ncym theory are not lorentz invariant, the lorentz invariance remains in the propagators

at one loop.

2) ghost self energy part:

there are only two diagrams contributing here, the ghost-dipole loop and the counter-term.

the integrals appearing in ghost-dipole loop, is similar to the ghost-loop contributions dis-

cussed above, hence our argument holds true and the divergent part is obtained from the

usual su(n) gauge theory with c2(g) = 2.

the other important result we obtain here is a generalized ward identity,

k = 0.

3) dipole-ghost vertex:

there are three diagrams contributing here, the diagram with two-ghosts in the loop, the

diagram with one ghost in the loop and the counter-term. performing calculations by the

method explained above, after a long but straight-forward calculus, we again nd that the

divergent part of the loops is described by usual gauge theory result with c2(g) = 2.

for the three and four dipole vertices the same results are obtained. we see from explicit

loop calculations that the divergent part of the ncym theory at one loop, is governed by

the divergent part of the loops of a usual gauge theory. hence the divergent parts behave

like a local eld theory. however there are nite contributions at one loop level which are

non-local. these terms also break the lorentz invariance. appearance of such terms

suggests the possibility of non-local divergent terms at higher loops [12]. but, according to

our calculations [22], due to the bessel functions, the contribution of the non-local terms at

two loop are again suppressed.

we should remind here that, in all of the calculations we have assumed that the structure

constant, 2 sin( ~m  ~n), is non-zero. so, although our result is  independent, the above
arguments are not valid for  = 0 case 3.

3 in the rational  case always one can nd a basis on the torus under which the structure constant is

zero.

11

5 uv and ir behaviour of noncommutative gauge

theories

by explicit loop calculations, it was shown in previous section that the ncym theory is

renormalizable. here we want to discuss the uv and ir limits in more detail. since we

consider the theory on a torus, however in the large volume limit, p, the momentum, is

discrete and we need not to address the p  0 behaviour.

according to our results, although the theory is non-local and hence the usual renormal-

ization group arguments are not valid, the -function of ncym is negative, it is asymptot-

ically free. moreover in the large volume limit, the uv disentangles from the ir [13].

in the uv limit, besides the formal arguments of [13] our explicit calculations show that,

we deal with a non-local theory. in uv, although the theory is not scale invariant, it admits

a xed point.

the supersymmetric case, ncsym, is realized by the d2-brane in a b-eld background
[2,11] which in the   0, the low energy dynamics, like the usual d-brane arguments,
decouples from bulk. so the collective coordinates of the d2-brane, which are living in a

commuting space, form a single vector multiplet. the 7 scalars correspond to 7 transverse

direction of the brane. the dual of the vector multiplet, which is a scalar corresponds to

the position of the brane in the eleventh dimension [23]. hence the moduli space of the
u(1) ncsym theory is r7  s1. the coupling of this (2+1) dimensional gauge theory is
given by the circumference of the s1 factor. besides the transverse coordinates, since we are
interested in the gauge theories on nct, there are moduli coming from the compact space

and noncommutative structure of the tours.

in the string theory limit, these moduli are

those the t-duality group acting on them

mc =

sl(2)n
so(2)



sl(2)c
so(2)

.

(5.1)

the sl(2)n acts on the deformation parameter of the torus and the other on the corre-
sponding radii. considering the contribution from the at space we have

at strong coupling the s1 factor combines with sl(2)c and hence [8]

m = mc  r7  s1

m =

sl(2)n
so(2)



sl(3)c

 r7.

6 concluding remarks

in this paper, we have studied the sym on the nct more extensively. the ncsym is

described by the usual gauge theory action, with the commutators substituted for the moyal

bracket. as discussed in [2,11], the ncsym describes the low energy dynamics of d2-brane
wrapped on t 2 in a b-eld background, and in   0 it decouples from the bulk. studying
the nct, we argued that by means of morita equivalence we can map the u(n) ncsym

with a magnetic ux m to a u(1) ncsym theory, hence we only considered the u(1) case

in our later arguments.

using fourrier mode expansion, we wrote the moyal bracket algebra in terms of fourrier

basis, (3.3). the key idea, is the existence of commutative derivatives, could be dened on

the nct. hence one expects by going to the momentum space, the ncym translate to a

commutative gauge theory. we argued that the gauge group is the generalization of the
area-preserving dieomorphisms of the torus to the nct, sdif f (t 2
 ). as discussed, this
gauge group do not change the kahler structure of the nct. writing the ncym action

in the fourrier modes, we showed that it is like a usual gauge theory, with the structure

constants given by (3.7). the group indices are identied with the momentum.

we showed that the cartan sub-algebra in our case is u(1), and hence justied the string

theoretic arguments of [19]. the other gauge particles are dipoles under this u(1) part.

having the action, we worked out the loop calculations, and found out that

i) although the ncym is not a local gauge theory in the usual sense and the interactions

introduced in it are not lorentz invariant, the divergent parts of the propagator loops are

lorentz invariant and the divergent part of the interaction vertices have the same structure

of the classical ones. this enables us to make the statements we already know about the

usual gauge theories, for the ncym too. the divergent parts of the loops are given by the

usual theory results with the quadratic casimir equal to 2. moreover we can have generalized

ward identities here.

ii) the non-locality in the theory, is not removed in the loops, but since the theory is

renormalizable, it has the same non-local structure in all higher loops and high energies. in

other words the structure constants of the theory are not renormalized, like the usual gauge

theories. the contribution of the non-local terms to the dipoles self energy are nite and

also suppressed at high energies so that, they will not give further contributions at higher

loops [22].

iii) since the loop corrections are similar to the usual su(n) gauge theories, the ncym

theories are asymptotically at and in spite of non-locality, the theory has got a uv xed

13

point.

iv) ncym are among the few gauge theories which admit the maximally super extension.

as argued here, these theories are exact. the moduli space structure of these theories,
compared with the usual (2+1) n = 8 sym, have an extra sl(2) factor acting on the

noncommutative structure of the torus. since this extra factor changes the deformation

parameter , the structure constants of the theory are also changed, but its behaviour is not

altered.

the possible singular structure of the moduli space, is an open question we will postpone

it to a future work.
