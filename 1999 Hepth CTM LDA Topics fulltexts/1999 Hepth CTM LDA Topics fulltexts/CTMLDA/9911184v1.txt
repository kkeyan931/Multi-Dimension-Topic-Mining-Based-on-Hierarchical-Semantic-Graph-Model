abstract

we investigate yang-mills instantons on a 7-dimensional manifold of g2 holon-
omy. by proposing a spherically symmetric ansatz for the yang-mills connection,
we have ordinary dierential equations as the reduced instanton equation, and give
some explicit and numerical solutions.

1 introduction

recent progress in string duality has stimulated a great deal of interest in yang-mills in-
stantons on higher dimensional manifolds of special holonomy.1, 2 the higher dimensional
yang-mills instanton equations on such manifolds have been given in several papers.36 it
is known that some yang-mills instantons on the manifolds can be extended to solitonic
solutions of the low energy eective theory of the heterotic string7, 8 preserving 1
16 or 2
of the 10-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetry.

16

the manifolds of special holonomy admit covariantly constant spinors and dene the
supersymmetric cycles (calibrated submanifolds).6 solitons and instantons of superstring
theory or m-theory can be considered to be wrapping branes around a supersymmetric
cycle.9, 10, 11 the manifolds also play an important role in generalizations of the donaldson-
floer-witten theory to higher dimensions.12, 13 baulieu et al12 found a topological action
on a 8-dimensional manifold of spin(7) holonomy; their covariant gauge xing conditions
lead to yang-mills instanton equations on the manifold. compared with the 4-dimensional
case, there are a few explicit yang-mills instantons on 7- and 8-dimensional manifolds
of g2 and spin(7) holonomy.7, 8, 14 recently yang-mills instantons on a 8-dimensional
manifold of spin(7) holonomy have been examined in detail.15

in this paper we investigate yang-mills instantons on a 7-dimensional manifold of g2
holonomy. our paper is organized as follows: in section 2 and section 3 we briey review
the octonionic algebra and the explicit metric of a manifold of g2 holonomy given by

gibbons et al;16 in section 4 we express yang-mills instantons on 7-dimensional manifolds
of g2 holonomy; in section 5, under a spherically symmetric ansatz, we solve the yang-
mills instanton equations on the manifold described in section 3, and present some new
explicit solutions obtained from the riccati equation and numerical solutions.

2 octonionic algebra

in this section we briey review the octonionic algebra following the papers.8, 14, 17 the
exceptional lie group g2 which is a subgroup of spin(7) is the automorphism group of
the octonionic algebra. the generators of spin(7) are given by

ab =

1
2

(ab  ba),

where a(a = 1,   , 7) are 7-dimensional  matrices dened by

{a, b} = 2ab.

the generators of the octonionic algebra {1, ea}, (a = 1,   , 7) obey the relations

where cabc is totally antisymmetric tensor with non zero components

ea  eb = ab1 + cabcec,

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

c123 = c516 = c624 = c435 = c471 = c673 = c572 = +1.

(2.4)

if the dual tensor cabcd is dened by

the following relations are satised

by the use of the tensor cabcd, one can decompose the 21-dimensional lie algebra of
spin(7) into the direct sum of the 14-dimensional lie algebra of g2 and the 7-dimensional
cd onto the lie algebra of g2 and the
orthogonal subspace p. indeed, the projector p1

3 explicit metric on 7-dimensional manifold of g2

holonomy

in this section we describe the explicit metric on a 7-dimensional manifold of g2 holonomy.
it has been rst given as a metric on the r4 bundle over s3 by solving the einstein
equation:16

ds2 = 2dr2 + 2(i  ai)2 + 2ii,

(3.1)

where i = 1, 2, 3 and , ,  are functions solely of the radial coordinate r. the symbols
i denote the left invariant 1-forms on the s3 base manifold and the symbols i denote
the left invariant 1-forms on the ber r4. they satisfy
1

ijkj  k,

di =

ijkj  k.

di = 
2i and the explicit forms of the functions

(3.2)

then su(2) connection ai is given by ai = 1
are

r(cid:17)3(cid:19)1

where a is an arbitrary constant.

12

(3.3)

we can also construct the metric (3.1) by solving the rst order equation for the spin

connection,18, 19

under the spherically symmetric ansatz (3.1), the orthonormal basis is

ab =

e7 = dr,

e

i = (i  ai)

where i = 1, 2, 3 = 4, 5, 6, and the spin connection ab is obtained by the equations

4 yang-mills instanton on 7-dimensional manifold of

g2 holonomy

here we dene a yang-mills instanton equation on the 7-dimensional manifold of g2
holonomy in terms of a special closed 3-form ,3, 6

using the antisymmetric tensor cabc, the 3-form  can be written as

  f = f.

and then eq. (4.1) becomes

 =

1
3!

cabcea  eb  ec,

fab =

2

cab

cdfcd.

the seven components of eq. (4.3) are as follows:

f71 = f26 + f53, f72 = f61 + f34, f73 = f42 + f15,
f74 = f23 + f65, f75 = f46 + f31, f76 = f12 + f54,
f63 = f25 + f14.

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

the curvatures (4.3) provide the solutions of the yang-mills equation on the manifold,
daf ab = 0, as a consequence of the bianchi identity. we shall call solutions of (4.3)
yang-mills instantons. the yang-mills instantons can be embedded into supersymmetric
theories as solutions to the equation of motion. it is known that there is a spinor  on
the manifold of g2 holonomy which satises the conditions:

 = 0, gab = 0,

(4.5)
where  denotes the covariant derivative of the levi-civita connection on the manifold.3, 19
then, one can use the covariantly constant spinor as a global supersymmetric parameter
dened on the manifold. the supersymmetric transformation of a spinor eld , a super
partner of yang-mills connection,

(4.6)

is zero according to the eqs. (4.3) and (4.5). so the yang-mills instanton becomes a
supersymmetric solution preserving the spinor .

note that the spin connection leads to a g2 yang-mills connection:

a =

1
3

gabab.

(4.7)

using (3.4) and the symmetry between the rst and second pair of indices of the riemann
curvature rabcd, we can see that the curvature of a satises the yang-mills instanton
equation (4.3).7

5 ansatz for g2 yang-mills connection

now we construct yang-mills instantons on the 7-dimensional manifold of g2 holonomy
described in section 3. referring to the spin connection (3.6)-(3.10), we propose a spher-
ically symmetric ansatz for the g2 yang-mills connection a = 1

3 gabaab:

a7i = 2aei,

a7i = (b  c)e
aij = ijkaek,
aij = ijk(dek + be
aij = ijk(dek + ce

(5.1)

(5.2)

(5.5)

where a, b, c, d are the functions of the radial coordinate r. we can see that the above
connection satises

aij =

klakl

(5.6)

and so does their curvature, i.e., they are just projected onto the lie algebra of g2. note
that the indices denote those of the lie algebra of g2, not of the dierential forms. this
connection reproduces eq. (4.7) by putting

the rst one is nothing but the connection (4.7), while the second one is a new solution.
although their dierence is only the signature of a, these two solutions lead to dierent
curvatures.

in cases (ii) and (iii), a is zero from (5.17) so that the yang-mills instanton equation

(4.3) gives two nonlinear ordinary dierential equations for b and d:

where we have used eqs. (3.11) and (3.3). let us introduce new variables x and y ,

and a new parameter s = ln( r

b =

x + 1

r

, d =

y  3

= 2(x + 1)y .

(5.23)

(5.24)

(5.25)

in case (ii), the eq. (5.25) is trivial as y = 0 (d =  1

2 ) and eq. (5.24) becomes the

riccati equation:

dx
ds

=

1  92

2

(x + 1) + 3 + (x + 1)2.

(5.26)

we can nd a general solution of eq. (5.26):

x = 3  1 +

1
( 1
2 + c
r2 )

,

(5.27)

where c is an arbitrary integration constant. taking the limit c  , we have a special
solution x = 3  1. for the explicit solution (5.27) the nonzero components of the
yang-mills connection and the curvature are {aij, aij = aij} and {fij, fij = fij}. in this
case the curvature becomes

(5.31)

it is known that there are no yang-mills instantons with nite action on the n-
dimensional at space (or sphere) unless n = 4.6 unfortunately, the action for our solution
diverges too. however the second chern class evaluated on the ber r4 has a nite value:

where t r refers to the adjoint representation of su(2) and volsu (2) is the volume of su(2).
note that the value comes from the innite surface according to 1
 = 0 at r = a. the
meaning of the nite second chern class remains an open problem here.

now we proceed to case (iii). we rst note that the two points on the (x, y )-plane, l =

(1,3), m = (1,3), are xed points, i.e., the stationary solutions of eqs. (5.24)

and (5.25). we calculate other solutions numerically and show the ows of appropriate
numerical solutions in figure 1.

(5.34)

note that the external eld  coming from the background metric is included in the
equations. if we consider the asymptotic region (large radial coordinate region), we can
regard eqs. (5.33) and (5.34) as gradient ow equations since  approaches a constant.
then two xed points, o = (0, 0), n = (2, 0), appear, adding to the points l and m
described above. by evaluating the 2  2 hessian matrix h

hij =

2w1

x ix j

(x 1 = x, x 2 = y )

(5.35)

at the four xed points, we can see that o is a stable point and l, m, n are saddle points
(the morse index is 1). this analysis provides a qualitative explanation for the behavior
of the ows in figure 1.
