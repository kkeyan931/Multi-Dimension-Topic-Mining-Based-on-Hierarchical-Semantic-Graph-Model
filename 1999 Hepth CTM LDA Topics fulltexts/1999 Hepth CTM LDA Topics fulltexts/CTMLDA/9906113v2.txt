lame instantons

we perform a precise analytic test of the instanton approximation by comparing the exact band
spectrum of the periodic lame potential to the tight-binding, instanton and wkb approximations.
the instanton result gives the correct leading behavior in the semiclassical limit, while the tight-

binding approximation does even better. wkb is o by an overall factor of pe/.

periodic quantum systems arise in many areas of physics, from crystal structures in solid state physics, to optical
lattices in amo physics, to solitons in polymer physics, and to the vacuum structure of qcd. an important general
feature of these systems is the phenomenon of quantum tunneling that broadens discrete energy spectra into bands.
various semiclassical techniques have been developed to analyze the spectra of such systems: the tight-binding,
wkb, and instanton approximations. in quantum eld theory, the instanton approach provides important insights
into symmetry breaking and the qcd vacuum [1]. in this paper we compare these approximations for an exactly
solvable periodic system  the lame model  with particular emphasis on the instanton approximation for the width
of the lowest energy band. two well-studied quantum mechanical instanton models [24] are the double-well, v () =
1

g (1  cos(g)). the lame model, v () = 1

2g sn2(g |), provides

2 2(1  g)2, and the sine-gordon, v () = 1

a new example, and has the advantage that it can be solved exactly without the instanton approximation, while the
instanton calculation can also be done analytically. we nd that there is a dierence between the semiclassical and
tight-binding limits, limits that are often regarded as synonymous. we also highlight a new connection between the
non-perturbative instanton approach and the algebraic approach to spectra [5,6].

consider the schrodinger-like lame equation

d2
d2 () + j (j + 1) sn2(|)() = e()



(1)

where j = 1, 2, 3, . . . is an integer, sn(|) is one of the jacobi elliptic functions, and 0    1 is the elliptic parameter.
this equation is known to be exactly solvable in terms of theta functions, and is known to have a spectrum of j bound
bands [7]. the function sn2(|) is periodic, with period 2k(), where k() = r /2
d/p1   sin2  is the elliptic
quarter period. for small  (say  < 0.2), sn2(|) looks to the eye like sin2(). for large  (say  > 0.9), sn2(|)
looks like a sequence of periodically displaced poschl-teller sech2() potentials (see fig. 1), displaced with a period
that diverges logarithmically, 2k()  log( 16

1 ), as   1.

fig. 1. the function sn2(|), with  = 0.999, as a function of . the period is 2k(0.999) = 9.68.

while the lame equation is exactly solvable for any j and , explicit expressions for the wavefunctions and energies
are cumbersome for j  2 [7]. a dramatic simplication is that the band-edge energies of (1) are given by the 2j + 1
eigenvalues of the nite dimensional matrix j 2
y , where jx and jy are su(2) generators in a spin j representation
[5,8]. thus we can evaluate the width e of the lowest band as the dierence between the two smallest eigenvalues
y . for example, for j = 1, e exact = 1 ; for j = 2, e exact = 1  + 22   + 1; and for
of the matrix j 2
j = 3, e exact = 3(1  ) + 21   + 42  24   + 2. we will be interested later in large values of j, in which
case such explicit expressions, as functions of , become more dicult to derive. instead, we have shown algebraically
that for any j, the exact energy splitting of the lowest band, as   1, is

as   1 the period becomes innite, which suppresses tunneling, and we therefore expect this to be relevant for
the tight-binding and semiclassical approximations. note that the band-width (2) vanishes as   1, and vanishes
more rapidly for larger values of j. we now compare this exact result (2) with the tight-binding, instanton and wkb
approximations.

in the tight-binding approximation of solid state physics [9] the separation l between neighboring wells becomes

large and we treat the potential as a sum of periodically displaced atomic potential wells: v () = pn u (  nl).

in the lame case, this physical approximation is explicitly realized by the remarkable mathematical identity [10]:

 sn2(|) =

e()

as expected, each atomic well has the form of a poschl-teller well (but the rescaling factor
is non-obvious).
including the j(j + 1) factor from (1), each atomic well has j discrete bound states, and the eect of the periodic sum
is to broaden these states into the j bound bands of the lame potential. for the lowest band we use the ground state
2k  ) of the atomic well. the width of this band can be calculated using standard solid

where in the second line we have kept dominant terms as   1, and used the fact that exp[k()/k()]

2 (1  ) + . . .). this result (4) agrees precisely with the exact result (2) to this order in 1  . therefore, for
any j, the tight-binding approximation is good as   1; i.e. as the separation between atomic wells becomes large.
we now turn to an instanton evaluation of the width of the lowest band, expected to be good in the semiclassical
limit in which tunneling eects are small. naively, one might expect that this is also just the   1 limit in which the
wells become innitely separated, but it is actually more interesting than this. to make contact with the standard
instanton approach [24] we dene

where g is some coupling (which we will relate to j and  below), and we have chosen units so that the perturbative
mass in a given well is 1. the width of the lowest band can be found by considering the euclidean path integral
connecting two neighboring classical minima of the potential; here  = 0 and  = 2k/g for example. rescaling the
eld variable to  = g,

thus the semiclassical limit is hg  1, or 1
2 h  vpeak : the ground state in each well is far below the barrier height.
there is a standard technique for computing the instanton approximation for the width of the lowest band [24]. in
the semiclassical limit, the euclidean path integral is dominated by instanton solutions to the euclidean equations

here the integration constant has been chosen so that the instanton is centered at t = 0, and sn1 means the inverse
function (a standard function in mathematica). this instanton interpolates between  = 0 at t = , and  = 2k()
at t = +, as shown in fig. 2. the corresponding euclidean action is

the leading exponential factor in the instanton expression for the band width is exp[s0/(hg)]. but there is also a
dt2 +v (inst(t)). this prefactor is physically

prefactor that is related to the determinant of the uctuation operator  d2
signicant, as it encapsulates the collective coordinate eects of uctuations about the instantons. here,

v (inst(t)) = (1  )(cid:20)  tanh4(t) + 2(1  ) tanh2(t)  1

which is plotted in fig. 3. we see that v (inst(t)) is highly localized in the vicinity of the instanton, and tends to 1
(the square of the mass) as t  , as expected.

coleman has given a very simple method [2] for evaluating the uctuation determinant (with zero mode removed),

resulting in the formula (for a periodic potential)

where the constant c is simply determined by the asymptotic behavior of the zero mode:

inst(t)  c e|t| as |t|  .
here, the zero mode is inst(t) = sech(t)/q1   tanh2(t)  21 e|t|. thus we obtain the lame instanton result

to relate this to the eigenvalues e of the lame equation (1), we compare (1) with the schrodinger equation,  h2

as a function of j this diers from the exact and tight-binding expressions (2) and (4), even in the large period limit
  1. however, from (6) and (12), the semiclassical limit hg  1 means j(j + 1)  1. so, to compare the instanton

formula (13) with the results (2) and (4) it is not enough to take   1; we also need to take j to be large. physically,
it is not enough to take far-separated wells; they must also be deep wells. for large j and  near 1,

which agrees perfectly with the large j limit (using stirlings formula) of the exact result (2).

as another test of our instanton formula (13) we can x  to any value (not necessarily near 1) and take j large
(in order to be in the semiclassical regime), and compare to the band-width obtained numerically from the two
lowest eigenvalues of the matrix j 2
y . the results are shown in fig. 4, showing 10% agreement for j  10. in
terms of the algebraic spectral program [5,6], we nd that non-perturbative instantons play an interesting role in the
semiclassical limit via eigenvalue dierences for nite dimensional, but very large matrices. as a nal calculation,
we have computed the wkb approximation for the energy splitting, and we nd that in the semiclassical limit
ewkb = 2h
 einst, conrming that wkb gets the correct leading exponential
but the wkb prefactor normalization is incorrect [12].

to conclude, the instanton approximation gives the correct leading semiclassical result for the lowest band-width.
but the lame model (1) has two independent parameters,  and j, that allow us to probe separately the far-separated-
well and deep-well limits respectively. the tight-binding approximation (something of a misnomer) is good for large
period, for any well-depth; while the instanton approximation requires deep wells for a given period so that the
combination j(j + 1) is large. it would be interesting to study instanton - anti-instanton interactions and correlation
functions in the lame system, and to compare to lattice simulations in the spirit of [13]. also, lame solitons with
spatial prole of the form (7) will arise in the corresponding 1 + 1 dimensional model.
