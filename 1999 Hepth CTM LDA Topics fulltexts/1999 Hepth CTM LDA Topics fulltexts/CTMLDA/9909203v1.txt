abstract

we construct the complete and explicit non-linear kaluza-klein ansatz for deriving
the bosonic sector of n = 4 su (2)  u (1) gauged ve-dimensional supergravity from the
reduction of type iib supergravity on s5. this provides the rst complete example of such
an s5 reduction that includes non-abelian gauge elds, and it allows any bosonic solution

of the ve-dimensional n = 4 gauged theory to be embedded in d = 10.

introduction

recently, a new duality was conjectered, which relates supergravities in anti-de sitter back-

grounds to superconformal eld theories on their boundaries [1, 2, 3]. since the anti-de sitter

backgrounds arise as solutions of lower-dimensional gauged supergravities, the conjectured

ads/cft correspondence has led to a revival of interest in deriving these supergravities

by kaluza-klein reduction from the fundamental string theories and m-theory in d = 10

and d = 11.

it has long been believed that many gauged supergravities arise from the kaluza-klein

reduction of eleven-dimensional supergravity or the type iia and iib supergravities on

certain spherical internal spaces. at the linearised level, it is well established that the

spectra of the massless supermultiplets in the maximal gauged supergravities in d = 4 and

d = 7 coincide with those coming from appropriate truncations of the s4 and s7 reductions

of d = 11 supergravity [4, 5]. likewise, the spectrum of maximal gauged supergravity in
d = 5 is known to arise from a truncation of the s5 reduction from type iib supergravity

[6, 7].

although these linearised results are rather easily established, it is much harder to de-

termine whether the truncations to the massless supermultiplets are consistent as the full

non-linear level. the key point of concern here is that once the non-linear interactions

are included, the possibility exists that in a full untruncated reduction, source terms built

purely from the elds of the massless multiplet might arise in the eld equations for the

lower-dimensional massive multiplets, making it inconsistent to set the massive elds to

zero.

indeed, it is not hard to establish that in a sphere reduction of a generic higher-

dimensional theory, there will denitely be such couplings, making a consistent truncation

to the massless sector impossible. thus if the sphere reductions (with truncation to the

massless supermultiplet) in supergravities are to be consistent, it must be because of re-

markable special properties of these particular theories. general arguments suggesting that

reductions to the supergravity multiplet should always be consistent were constructed in

[8].

early indications of such properties were found for the s7 reduction of d = 11 super-

gravity in [9]. subsequently, a complete demonstration of the consistency in this case was

presented in [10], although the construction was rather implicit. recently, a somewhat less
implicit construction was presented for the easier case of the reduction ansatz for the s4

reduction of d = 11 supergravity, to give the maximal gauged supergravity in d = 7 [12].
no analogous results have been obtained for the s5 reduction of type iib supergravity,

1

however, and so for now the consistency of this reduction remains conjectural.

although one would certainly like to know the complete reduction ansatze in all cases,

for many purposes it is in practice more useful to have a fully explicit ansatz for a restricted

subset of the elds of the entire maximal massless multiplet. for example, the known

charged anti-de sitter black hole solutions of gauged supergravities make use only of gauge

elds in the maximal abelian subgroup of the full gauge group. thus, for example, if

one is interested in oxidising these solutions back to the higher dimension of the original

parent supergravity, it would be sucient to have a consistent kaluza-klein reduction

ansatz for the abelian truncation of the full gauged theory. kaluza-klein ansatze of this
sort were constructed in [11], for the s7 and s4 reductions of d = 11 supergravity, and
the s5 reduction of type iib supergravity.
in all cases fully non-linear bosonic ansatze
were obtained. in the case of the s5 reduction, the ansatz was fully consistent, while in

the reductions from d = 11, the ansatze were fully consistent within limited subspaces of

solutions, including the charged ads black holes.

another way of making the reductions more managable, while maintaining full consis-

tency, is to truncate from the maximal supermultiplet to a smaller supergravity multiplet.
by doing this, the full non-linear ansatz for the s4 reduction from d = 11 to n = 1 su (2)-

gauged supergravity in d = 7 was obtained in [13]. although in principle subsumed by the

n = 2 results in [12], in practice the full explicitness of the n = 1 results makes them more

transparent and usable in those cases where the n = 1 truncation is sucient.

in a similar vein, the bosonic sector of the full n = 2 su (2)-gauged supergravity in
d = 6 was recently obtained, as an explicit consistent (local) s4 reduction of the massive

type iia theory [14]. a distinction in this case is that there is no gauged supergravity in

d = 6 with the maximal (n = 4) supersymmetry that can occur in ungauged theories, and

so the construction in [14] yields the largest gauged pure supergravity that exists in d = 6.

as far as the ve-dimensional gauged supergravities are concerned, no non-linear reduc-

tion ansatze other than the u (1)3 maximal abelian case in [11] have been obtained until
recently. studying the states on the coulomb branch of n = 4 super yang-mills theory
from the viewpoint of ve-dimensional gauged supergravity [15] provides further indications

of consistent truncations from type iib supergravity. for example, in [16] non-linear reduc-

tion ansatze involving larger numbers of the scalar elds of the maximal d = 4, 5 and 7

theories were presented, although without the inclusion of gauge elds.

in this paper, we shall construct the complete and explicit non-linear kaluza-klein
reduction ansatze for the bosonic sector of n = 4, su (2)  u (1) gauged supergravity in

2

d = 5, obtained from the s5 reduction of type iib supergravity. the n = 4 gauged theory

in d = 5 was constructed by l. romans [17]; hereafter, we shall refer to this model as

the romans theory. our ansatz allows us to re-interpret any bosonic solution of the ve-

dimensional n = 4 theory back in d = 10. the ansatz provides the rst example of a fully
consistent non-linear kaluza klein reduction of type iib supergravity on s5 that includes

non-abelian gauge elds.

a new feature of this s5 reduction, which has not been encountered in previous explicit

constructions [13, 14], is the presence of higher-rank gauge potentials that transform non-

trivially under the gauge group. specically, there are two 2-form potentials in the d = 5

theory, which form a charged doublet under the u (1) factor of the gauge group.

the paper is organised as follows.

in section 2, we establish our notation and con-

ventions, giving lagrangians and equations of motion for type iib supergravity and the
d = 5, n = 4 su (2)  u (1) gauged supergravity. in section 3, we obtain the reduction
ansatze, and discuss some of the interesting features. after the conclusion, in section 4, we

include an appendix giving results for the ricci tensor of the metric reduction ansatz.

2 d = 10 iib supergravity and romans theory in d = 5

the bosonic sector of ten dimensional type iib supergravity comprises the metric, a self-

dual 5-form eld strength, a scalar, an axion, an r-r 3-form and an ns-ns 3-form eld

strength. there is no simple covariant lagrangian for type iib supergravity, on account of

the self-duality constraint for the 5-form. however, one can write a lagrangian in which the

5-form is unconstrained, which must then be accompanied by a self-duality condition which

is imposed by hand at the level of the equations of motion [18]. this type iib lagrangian

turning now to the n = 4 gauged supergravity in d = 5 [17], it has a bosonic sector

comprising the metric, a scalar, the su (2) yang-mills potentials ai

 which transform as a charged doublet under the u (1).

(11)

the operator d dened in this equation is the u (1) gauge-covariant exterior derivative. note

that the complex eld a(2) satises a rst-order equation of motion, of the kind referred to

as odd-dimensional self-duality in [20].

as discussed in [17], there are three inequivalent theories, corresponding to dierent
choices for the gauge coul,ings in (7): n = 40 in which g2 = 0; n = 4+ in which g2 = 2g1
and n = 4 in which g2 = 2g1 (see also [21]). the n = 4+ theory is obtained by

truncating the gauged so(6), n = 8 supergravity theory in ve-dimensions, while the
n = 40 and n = 4 theories arise as truncations of non-compact n = 8 supergravities.
the equations of motion (10) are precisely those of the n = 4+ theory. from the lagrangian

of the romans theory one might conclude that it is not possible to set the u (1) coupling

constant g1 to be zero. however, as was pointed out in [22], after appropriate rescalings the

limit can be taken.

in the next section, we shall construct the ansatze that give this theory by reducing

type iib supergravity on a 5-sphere.

3 reduction ansatze on the ve-sphere

to construct the reduction ansatze, we follow a procedure similar to that used in [13, 14].
we take as our starting point the u (1)3 abelian truncation obtained in [11], which involved

two independent scalar elds. one can perform a consistent truncation of this, in which two

of the three u (1) potentials are set equal, and at the same time one of the scalar degrees

of freedom in eliminated. after doing so, the metric on the internal 5-sphere takes the

following form

d2

5 = x  d2 + x 2 s2(d  gb(1))2

4 x1 c2(cid:16)d2 + sin2  d2 + (d + cos  d

(12)

(13)

(14)

at x = 1, in the absence of the u (1) gauge elds, the metric (12) describes a unit 5-sphere.

(the gauge eld a(1) appearing in (12) is the one that comes from setting two of the original

u (1) gauge elds in [11] equal.)

we can now make a non-abelian generalisation of the the 5-sphere metric ansatz, by in-
troducing the three left-invariant 1-forms i on the 3-sphere, which satisfy di =  1
2 ijk j
k. these can be written in terms of the euler angles as 1 + i 2 = ei (d + i sin  d),

3 = d + cos  d. thus we are naturally led to generalise (12) to

(15)

the abelian limit (12) is recovered by setting the i = 1 and i = 2 components of the su (2)

gauge potentials to zero.

by proceeding along these lines, we are eventually led to the following ansatze for the
ten-dimensional metric, the 5-form eld strength h(5)  g(5) +  g(5), and the two 2-form
potentials:

(2) in the type iib theory. the ten-dimensional dilaton and the axion are

dimensional spacetime metric ds2

constants, which without loss of generality we have set to zero. the su (2) yang-mills eld

all the elds x, a

are taken to depend only on the coordinates of the ve-dimensional spacetime.1 note also
1note that the metric reduction ansatz in (16) has a fairly simply form, and ts in with the general pattern

(1). it should be emphasised that

of kaluza-klein metric ansatze, such as have been seen in many previous examples. (see [23, 24, 25] for some

earlier examples, and [26, 11, 13, 14] for some more recent ones.) it is the determination of the reduction

ansatze for the eld strengths that is the more dicult part of the problem, and since the consistency of the

reduction depends crucially on conspiracies between the eld strength and metric contributions, it is only

when the full ansatz is known that the consistency can be established.

6

that since the two 2-form potentials of the 5-dimensional supergravity are charged under
the u (1) factor in the su (2) u (1) gauge group, these elds appear in the reduction ansatz
with the appropriate  dependence for charged u (1) harmonics.

the ten-dimensional hodge dual of g(5) turns out to be

where   d  gb(1), and 3  h1  h2  h3.

we must now verify that the ansatze (16) do indeed yield a consistent reduction of the

type iib theory to the n = 4 gauged supergravity in d = 5. let us begin by noting that
the bianchi identity for h(5), and the eld equations for the ns-ns and r-r 3-forms of the

type iib theory become, in the complex notation,

d h(5) = i
2

f (3)  f(3) ,

d f(3) = i h(5)  f(3) .

(18)

we now nd that the bianchi identity for h(5) gives rise to the following ve-dimensional

equations:

(2)  g(2),

(19)

these are precisely equations of motion of the romans theory.

plugging the ansatze (16) into the equation of motion for f(3) in (18) gives rise to the

ve-dimensional rst-order equation for a(2) in (10), and also the second-order equation

d(x 2 f(3)) = g2 x2 a(2) ,

(20)

where the u (1) gauge-covariant exterior derivative d is as dened in (11). this second

order equation of motion is in fact implied by the rst order equation.

with our ansatze, the ten-dimensional equations of motion for the dilaton and axion are

automatically satised. the nal step is to substitute the ansatze into the ten-dimensional

einstein equation (2). there are ten independent types of components of the ricci tensor,

of which eight are non-vanishing, and are given in the appendix.

(the components of

7

the einstein equation (2) associated with the two vanishing ones, r56 and r5i, just give
identities 0 = 0.) the r5 and r5i components simply yield identities of the type z = z in
(2), while r6 gives an equation of motion for the u (1) eld strength g(2) which coincides
with (10). the r55, r66 and rij components reproduce the scalar equation of motion in
(10). finally, the r components yield the ve-dimensional einstein equations, while r
give the equations of motion for the su (2) gauge eld strengths. thus the full consistency

of the reduction ansatz (16) is established.

4 conclusion

in this paper, we have constructed the explicit and complete all-orders ansatz for obtaining
the bosonic sector of su (2)  u (1) gauged n = 4 supergravity in d = 5, by kaluza-klein
reduction on s5 from type iib supergravity. this is the largest supersymmetric s5 reduction

that has been constructed. this is a particularly signicant case from the point of view

of the ads/cft correspondence, since the d = 5 gauged supergravities coming from type

iib have ads5 solutions whose boundary cfts are four-dimensional. in this embedding,

we showed that the ten-dimensional moduli, parameterised by the dilaton and the axion,

are xed.

our results for this consistent n = 4 reduction lend further credence to the conjecture

that the so(6) gauged n = 8 supergravity in d = 5 should also arise as a consistent
s5 reduction. the n = 8 reduction can be expected to be extremely complicated, and

so our simpler n = 4 truncation could prove to be very useful in circumstances where

only the n = 4 subset of elds are excited. for example, our reduction ansatz allows any

bosonic solution of the n = 4 gauged theory in ve dimensions to be oxidised back to an

exact solution in type iib supergravity. from the standpoint of the ads/cft conjecture,

the fact that there is a consistent reduction ansatz means that the contributions of the

ve-dimensional elds in massive supergravity multiplets can be ignored when computing

correlation functions in the conformal eld theory on the boundary.
