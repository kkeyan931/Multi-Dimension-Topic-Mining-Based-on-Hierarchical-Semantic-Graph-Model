abstract: we deal with the problem of dieomorphism anomaly in theories with
branes. in particular we thoroughly analyze the problem of the residual chiral anomaly
of a vebrane immersed in mtheory, paying attention to its global formulation in the
vebrane worldvolume. we conclude that the anomaly can be canceled by a local coun-
terterm in the vebrane worldvolume.

this article deals with the problem of dieomorphism anomalies in theories with branes.
with respect to the traditional anomaly analysis in eld or superstring theories without
branes, the presence of branes introduces new questions. macroscopic branes in superstring
or mtheory are represented, from a geometrical point of view, by submanifold embedded
in the 10 or 11 dimensional ambient manifold. on the brane worldvolumes there live
elds that represent the dynamical degrees of freedom of the brane. simultaneously the
brane interacts with the ambient theory. let us suppose that the latter is anomaly free
and that the fermionic degrees of freedom on the brane are chiral. then the overall theory
of the brane embedded in the ambient theory might contain chiral anomalies which break
the invariance under those dieomorphisms that map the brane worldvolume to itself.
anomaly contributions may be of three types: there may be anomalies of the brane theory
in isolation, anomalies due to the embedding, i.e. anomalies due to pulledback metrics or
connections from the ambient manifold, and nally inow anomalies, i.e. anomalies due to
the interaction of the brane with the ambient theory. all these types contain contributions
from the tangent bundle of the worldvolume w of the embedded brane, but the last
two types of anomalies contain also normal bundle contributions. they come in fact from
characteristic classes of the ambient tangent bundle t m , where m is the ambient space
time; the wellknown decomposition t m |w = t w  n holds, n being the bundle normal
to the brane and the characteristic classes of t m will split accordingly. the purely t w

1

part of the anomaly can be thought of as due to dieomorphisms that map w  w . on
the other hand, the n part of the anomaly can be thought of as due to dieomorphisms that
leave w pointwise xed and can be interpreted as gauge transformations of n . these two
cases have an easy geometrical interpretation. they are essentially the two cases considered
so far in the literature. however they do not represent the most general situation. apart
from this, in all the examples considered so far, only local expressions of the relevant
anomalies have been used. reality is more complicated than this. we need to rene the
analysis in at least two directions.

to start with there are other dieomorphisms of m , which map w to w but are
not comprised in the two subgroups mentioned above. we remark that if we apply a
dieomorphism that maps w to w , in general the normal bundle is deformed and not
mapped to itself. we will argue later on that one must consider only dieomorphisms
which map n (globally) to itself. even with this simplication the relevant anomalies
cannot be thought of and treated as usual gauge anomalies. one has to rely on a more
general formalism which involves both dieomorphisms and gauge transformations on the
same footing. this can be done by considering general automorphisms of the relevant
principal bundle (rather than vertical automorphisms, i.e. ordinary gauge transformations,
alone).

in addition we will need formulas for anomalies expressed as basic forms in the space
time manifold m . the only way to achieve this is by introducing a background connection,
i.e. a spectator connection which is not transformed under the relevant transformations.
formulas for anomalies with a background connection can be found in the literature, [2, 3].
introducing a background connection is allowed for the following reason. let us consider a
principal ber bundle p (m, g) and a given connection a. any automorphism   autp
maps p to p but rotates it, i.e. p  p , and maps any connection a to a. however
a is a connection both in the original bundle and in the transformed one. therefore it
is consistent to keep one connection a0 xed, while rotating the bundle and all the other
connections. the background connection a0 allows us to write down local expressions for
anomalies. this is of course not in contradiction with the usual local expressions of the
same anomalies, which can be recovered by simply setting (locally) a0 = 0. as we shall
see, the framework considered in the paper needs in fact further qualications with respect
to the ordinary gauge theories setting just described.

as far as anomalies are concerned, however, one does not expect any signicant com-
plication from this more general treatment whenever anomaly cancellation takes place at
the level of characteristic classes (apart, of course, for the necessity to specify an appropri-
ate geometrical setup). for in this case anomalies are canceled at the source, so to speak,
and there is nothing left on which an anomalous behaviour can build up. however the
situation is dierent when a residual anomaly is canceled by means of a mechanism a la
greenschwarz.
in the latter case there is a physical input (the existence of a suitable
local eld) that does not follow simply from the automatisms of the descent equations.

in this regard there is a gap in the analysis carried out so far in the literature on
the subject. in [8] we have shown how to implement the anomaly cancellation mechanism
with background connection in the original greenschwarz case. in this paper we wish to

2

extend the analysis to theories with branes. actually we will concentrate on the case of
the m5brane anomaly, which alone contains all the above complications: it is a normal
bundle anomaly which can only be canceled via a greenschwarz mechanism, [4, 5, 6, 7, 10]
and [9] (analogous problems arise in other cases, [11, 12, 13], which will not be discussed
here but can be treated along the same lines).

let us summarize the m5brane problem. the geometric setting for this problem, [4],
is specied by the 11d manifold x of mtheory and by the 6d manifold w , representing
the worldvolume of the 5brane embedded in it.
in addition we have the wellknown
decomposition t x|w = t x  n , n being the bundle normal to the brane worldvolume,
whose structure group is so(5). in isolation, both theories on x and on w are anomaly
free. but, due to the embedding of w in x and to the physical coupling of the 5brane (see
eq.(1.1) below), one gets both induced and inow anomalies on w . these contributions to
the anomaly do not cancel completely: the residual anomaly is generated via the descent
equations by the 8form 1
24 p2(n ), where p2(n ) represents the second pontryagin class of
the normal bundle. now, the brane is magnetically coupled to mtheory via

df4 = w

(1.1)

where w is a representative of the poincare dual of w , and f4 is the 4form eld strength
of 11d supergravity. we showed in [7] that, due to (1.1), w = y , i.e. w is the boundary
of some 7manifold y . this implies that the normal bundle n is a direct sum, l  n , of
a trivial line bundle l and a vector bundle n  whose structure group is reduced to so(4).
it follows that the second pontryagin class of n becomes:

p2(n ) = p2(n ) = e(n )2  e2

(1.2)

where e is the euler class of the normal bundle. therefore the anomaly we have to do with
is generated via the descent equations by e. this is, roughly speaking, a summary of the
m5brane anomaly problem. we will clarify, in the course of the paper, various aspects
of this problem. but we would like to emphasize from the start the aspect of locality.
throughout the paper the form w in (1.1) is taken to be the diracdelta 5form. this
allows one to work within a local eld theory framework (with a topological defect). since
the residual anomaly has a local expression on the brane worldvolume, one has to require
that it be canceled by a local counterterm. from this point of view, however, the existing
literature does not oer a satisfactory solution. this is the main problem we want to cope
with.

in the present paper we intend to ll in the gaps described above. we propose a local
counterterm to cancel the residual m5brane anomaly. this mechanism is tailored to take
into account eq.(1.1). it is worth insisting that this equation, which expresses the magnetic
coupling of the 5brane to mtheory, requires the normal bundle splitting n = l  n :
this must be reected both in the form of the anomaly and of the counterterm. we will
see that this splitting is essential for the anomaly cancellation.

while meeting the above requirements, we make a point of using basic expressions
both for the anomaly and the counterterm and properly take into account the problems
connected with dieomorphisms in the presence of a normal bundle.

3

the paper is organized as follows. the next section is preliminary to the anomaly
analysis. since a crucial role in our problem is played by the reduction from so(5) bundles
and connections to so(4) ones, we devote a few pages to deriving a workable formalism
to deal with reducible connections.
in particular we nd for them an explicit formula,
(2.3), in terms of a unimodular section v which denes the corresponding reduction. next
we show that for reducible connections the form which represents the second pontryagin
class factorizes into the square of a pfaan.
in section 3 we set out to calculate the
expression of the anomaly corresponding to such a factorized class, and succeed in nding
an expression for it which is globally dened on the worldvolume of the 5brane. finally
in section 4 we introduce the local and globally dened counterterm which cancels such an
anomaly. we discuss the meaning of the counterterm and of the eld variables v introduced
to parametrize the various reductions.

2. reducible connections, pfaans and anomalies

our purpose in this section is to nd a basic expression of the residual anomaly of the
m5brane, taking into account the two complications mentioned in the introduction.

2.1 the geometric setting

the rst task is to specify what subgroup of the dieomorphisms of x is to be considered.
it would seem natural to consider dieomorphisms of x which map w to itself. however
we notice that, while t w is mapped to itself by any dieomorphism of this kind, the same
if  is any such dieomorphism, n and n are in
is not true for the normal bundle:
general dierent subbundles of t x. now, while a generic connection a in n is mapped
to a connection a in n , this is not true anymore for a background connection a0.
recalling the above remarks on background connections we point out that, if a0 is a
xed connection of n , it cannot in general be a connection in n . if we want a basic
expression of the anomaly, we have to come to terms with this fact. therefore we restrict
the subgroup of allowed dieomorphisms to those that leave n globally invariant and
denote it as dif f (x, n ). this implies that n has some physical signicance. in fact the
m5brane spectrum contains ve scalar elds, which span the normal directions to the
5brane. a symmetry transformation permitted by physics can only transform each one of
ve elds into a combination of them, but will not be allowed to switch on new directions.
this is exactly what the global invariance of n means.

the subgroup dif f (x, n ) can also be seen more usefully as autp , the group of
automorphisms of the principal ber bundle p with structure group so(5), associated to
the normal bundle n .
in this paper we will consider only the innitesimal version, its
lie algebra autp . the anomaly of the m5brane is the anomaly with respect to the
transformations z, which are the vector elds in autp . the next thing to consider is the
splitting n = l  n . this is an inevitable consequence of (1.1), see [7], and induces
the reduction of the structure group from so(5) to so(4). there is a manifold of such
splittings and one can take two attitudes: either one assumes there is a privileged one and
then further limit dif f (x, n ) to those dieomorphisms that preserve such a splitting, or

4

else one takes all of them into account. we will resume later on this discussion. for the
time being we treat the problem in complete generality: rst of all, we classify all possible
reductions of so(5) to so(4); then we notice that a dieomorphism of dif f (x, n ) maps
a reduced bundle into another reduced bundle, on the other hand the transform of a non
reducible connection in the rst bundle is not a connection in the transformed one; so it
makes sense to consider in p2(n ) only reducible connections. therefore we write down a
general formula for reducible connections and show that p2(n ) decomposes into the square
of a pfaan; nally we derive a basic formula for the anomaly. in the next section, we
show that it is possible to cancel it with a local counterterm in w .

2.2 the role of gamma matrices

a relevant role in the following is played by gamma matrices and by the relation between
the fundamental representation of sp(2) and the representation 4 of so(5). we devote the
present subsection to these pedagogical topics.

gamma matrices for spin(5) = so(5) are dened as follows: take euclidean gamma

matrices in 4d, 1, . . . , 4 and dene 5 = 1234. then a with a = 1, . . . , 5 satisfy

they form a 4  4 matrix representation of the cliord algebra of r5. we have 2

a = 1 and

{a, b} = 2ab

tr(abcde) = 4abcde

with 12345 = 1. the quadratic combinations

ab =

1
4

[a, b]

satisfy

[ab, cd] = acbd + adbc  bdac + bcad

[ab, c] = bca  acb

therefore they are the generators of the representation 4 of so(5). the latter can be
identied with the fundamental representation of sp(2) via the lie-algebra isomorphism
so(5)  sp(2). consider now the adjoint representation

the associated lie algebra isomorphism

ad : spin(5)  so(5)

is given on the basis elements ij = 1

4 [i, j] (i < j) by

ad : spin(5)  so(5)

(2.1)

ij  ei  ej

5

notice that so(5) acts on vectors of r5, in the usual way

(ei  ej)ek = eijk  ejik

and so ei  ej can be identied with the 5  5 matrix (eij)lm = iljm  imlj. therefore
the corresponding representations can be implemented at the level of spin(5) on  =
span(i)  mat(4) as follows ij  k = [ij, k]. therefore for any vector va, a = 1, . . . , 5,
it is convenient to dene v = vaa, i.e. va = 1

4 tr(av).

2.3 reducible connections

our purpose in this subsection is to justify formula (2.3) for reducible connections. on
rst reading one can jump directly to that formula and to the next subsection.

consider the principal bundle p  w associated to the normal bundle n and a
reduction r  w with structure group so(4) with associated bundles n  and ber r4.
any reduction j : r  p corresponds to a section  : w  e of the bundle e associated
to p with ber so(5)
so(4) = s4. to make this identication precise
consider the vector e = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1)  r5 and let j : so(4)  so(5) be given by

so(4) . we will identify so(5)

j(h) = h 0
0 1!

then so(4)e = e and we map [g]  so(5)
so(4) to ge  s4. once this identication is made it is
easy to identify e with the unit sphere subbundle s(n ) of the normal bundle n . to the
section  : w  s(n ) we can associate as usually a unimodular map v : p  r5, such that
v(pg) = g1v(p). in fact any point p  p (i.e. a basis p = (x1, . . . , , x5) of n(p)) denes

a map bp : r5  n(p)m via bp(w) =p5

splitting n = lv  n 

v, where n 

i=1 xiwi. now dene a function v(p) bp1((p)).

v has structure group so(4).

notice that v determines a line bundle lv within the normal bundle n and thus a

let now a be a connection in p . by denition dav is a tensorial 1-form on p with
values in r5. consider the 1-form  = v  dav on p . given the canonical basis ei of r5

we can decompose v as v =p5
5xi,j=1

v  dav 

i=1 viei, and

vi(dav)j[ei  ej] =

5xi,j=1

vi(dav)jeij.

we have the following properties

  takes values in so(5).

  vanishes on vertical vectors.

 for g  g, p  p, x  tpp we have ((rg)x)pg = adg1 (x)p.

therefore   1(w, adp ). we can therefore consider the connection on p

b = a   = a  v  dav

6

assume now that hv, vi = 1. then

dbv = dv  (a  v  dav)v = dv  av + (v  dav)v = dv  av  dav = 0

in fact

[vidavjvk(eij)ek]m = vidavjvk[eij]ml(ek)l =

= vmdavjvj  vkdavmvk = (hdav, viv  hv, vidav)m = dav

because hdav, vi = 0 if we assume that hv, vi = 1. the equation dbv = 0, means that v
is parallel with respect to b, i.e. b is a reducible connection (in p ), with reduced group
so(4) (see [1], vol.1, proposition 7.4 of chapter 2). b is therefore a connection reducible
to the subbundle determined by v. we will make now the assumption that the bundle p

to hold it is enough that both w and x have a spin-structure. now every connection a

has a double covering ep  w with structure group spin(5). in order for this assumption
on ep induces a connection, whih we call again a on p via the isomorphism 2.1. the above
argument generalizes to ep .
if, however, one works in ep with the spin connection and use the identications de-

scribed above, one must be aware that many familiar conventions change.
in the next
subsection we collect a set of useful formulas and results by making use of this formalism.

2.4 some explicit formulae and the pfaan

for simplicity, let us speak about a principal ber bundle p with structure group so(5),
a connection a in it and a map v from w to r5. we start with

fa = da

[v, ]  va = a

[a, ]

a = da = da 

fa =

[f, ]

and so on. notice that we have

and so

setting

p2(n ) =

1

(2)44!

5xa=1

tr(af f )tr(af f ),

f = f abab

(2.2)

and  = abab, we get

a = tr(af f ) = abcdef bcf de

a = 2a

bb

we will often use the following obvious vanishing argument. write

abcdeva

1 vb

2vc

3vd

4 ve

5  tr(v1v2v3v4v5)

where vi, i = 1, . . . , 5 are vectors in r5. if they are all orthogonal to the same vector v in
then the above expression vanishes.

the reducible connection b in p becomes in ep

bv = a 

[v, dav]

1
2

(2.3)

very often we will drop the label v in bv. whenever this happens it is understood that
we refer to the reduction represented by the v in question. we will not insist either on the

distinction between p and ep . it is easy to directly verify that

dbv v  dbv = 0

(2.4)

where use has been made of hv, davi = 0. as a consequence of (2.3) we have:

fb = fa +

1
4

[v, [fa, v]] 

1
4

[dav, dav]

from (2.4) we also deduce that [fb, v] = 0. this in turn implies that fb  v, i.e.
f ab
b va = 0 = f ab

b vb.

another useful result is the following: if z  autp is vertical, then, from (2.3), b(z) =

a(z).

let us consider next the eect of a generic z  autp on v. we have

lz v =

1
2

[iz b, v]

(2.5)

since [iz fb, v] = 0. any transformation v of this kind maps a reducible connection b into
a new reducible connection b + lz b. in fact

db+lz b(v + lzv) = 0

up to innitesimals of higher order. notice that z maps n to n , but deforms n 
maps it to n 

v, for it

v+v.

any reduction r of p determines a factorization of p2(n ) into the square of p f (a, v) =
tr(vfb fb). in fact, given a reduction determined by a vector v, it makes sense to consider

8

in p2(n ) only the relevant reducible connections. therefore in (2.2) we must replace
everywhere a with b  bv. but since, as we have noticed, fb  v, only the component of
a parallel to v will contribute in the expression of p2(n ) due to the vanishing argument.
therefore we can write

1
24

p2(n )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)v

= 2(cid:16)p f (a, v)(cid:17)2

,

p f (a, v) = tr(vfb fb),

 = (24)1(2)2 (2.6)

with obvious meaning of the subscript v. the number of independent degrees of freedom
in v is 4, the same as the dierence between the so(5) gauge variables and the so(4)
ones. what happens is clear: when considering reducible connections we trade the gauge
parameters lost in the reduction process with the free parameters in v.

notice that in p f (a, v), the pfaan corresponding to n 

v, only terms linear in v and

with an even number of dav survive (compare with [9]).

3. expression of the anomaly

our aim is to deduce the anomaly from the usual descent equations, starting from the pfaf-
an p f (a, v) introduced above while introducing a background connection. the derivation
is far from straightforward. so before we deal with it, let us work out a simpler wellknown
example and use it as a guide.

let us consider a generic connection a in a principal bundle p with base m , together
with a background connection a0. let i denote the unit interval over which a parameter
t is dened. then we can think of the interpolating connection at = a0 + t(a  a0) as a
connection on p  i and denote it a (from now on hatted symbols will indicate quantities
relevant to p  i). its curvature will be

f = fat  (a  a0)dt

correspondingly, if d denotes the exterior derivative in m , d will be the exterior derivative
on m  i. we can easily derive the chernsimons formula:

dzi

q( f ) =zi

dq( f )  q(ft)|1

0 = q(f ) + q(f0)

where q is any symmetric adinvariant polynomial1. so the chernsimons term can be
written

wq(a, a0) = zi

q( f )

we would like now to express in a similar way the corresponding anomaly. consider the
derivative in the space of connections on p  i along the vector t, with  = lza 
1(m, adp ), for any z  autp . then  f = d at = tdat   dt, and

zi

q( f) =zi

nq( f , f ) =zi

nq( d at, f) =zi

n dq(t, f) =

1q has n entries, but here and in the following we adopt the convention that whenever several entries

coincide, we write down only one of them, say q(f, . . . , f )  q(f ).

9

dzi

nq(t, f )  nq(, f ) = d(cid:18)n(1  n)zi

dt tq(, a  a0, fat )(cid:19)  nq(, f )

the last term drops for dimensional reasons (if dim m  2n  2) and the term in brackets
gives the wellknown expression of the anomaly.

let us return now to our original problem on the 5brane world volume w . for a
consistent construction we have to introduce both a reducible reference connection a0 and
a corresponding reference reduction v0. so we can dene p f (a0, v0) = tr(v0fb0 fb0 ). now
we introduce the interpolating connection at = ta + (1  t)a0 and a path of unit vectors vt
that interpolates between v0 and v1 = v. there are of course many dierent paths from v0
to v. all we say in this and the following section does not depend on what path we choose.
however this issue will become important in the nal section, in which we will need the
path to depend only on the initial and nal vectors. to satisfy this requirement we select
one single path from v0 to v = v1: since v0 and v lie both on a sphere s4 embedded in r5,
we will choose the geodesic (with respect to the embedded metric) passing through v0 and
v 2. this is a canonical choice of a path between v0 and v.

now we set

we have, of course,

bvt  bt = at 

1
2

[vt, dat vt]

dbt vt = 0

now let us consider the family rt of reductions of p , determined by vt. then we have
a bundle r  w  i. the path bt, just introduced, can be viewed as a connection b on
r. we can then repeat the above procedure. for simplicity, from now on we write our
pfaan in a more standard way:

q(a, b, c)  tr(abc)

(the constant  has been introduced in (2.6)). the polynomial q is indeed symmetric and
adinvariant.

let a  at = a0 + t(a  a0) on p  i and b = bt  1

2 [vt, vt]dt = at  1

2 [vt, d avt].

4 [[vt, vt], vt](cid:1) dt = 0 (using the gamma matrix algebra) and
f b = fbt (cid:18) bt +

dbt ([vt, vt])(cid:19) dt

1
2

then d bvt = dbtvt +(cid:0) vt + 1

f b = 0, where

d b

correspondingly we have

dzi

q(vt, f b, f b) =zi

dq(vt, f b, f b) q(vt, fbt , fbt )|1

0 = q(v1, fb , fb)+q(v0, fb0 , fb0 )

so the chernsimons term we were looking for is

wq(v, v0, b, b0) = zi

q(vt, f b, f b)

(3.1)

2this prescription is not unique whenever v1 = v0. however, except when both v0 and v1 are constant

sections, a case we can easily exclude, the ambiguity can be resolved by continuity.

10

we would like now to express in a similar way the anomaly. consider the derivative in
the space of connections on r along the vector t, with  = lz a  1(w, adp ) and along
v = lzv. then

where

 b  (bt 

[vt, vt]dt) = g()

g() = t( +

 f b = d b

we have

q(vt, f b, f b) =zi

q(vt, f b, f b) + 2zi

g(), f b) = 2zi

q(vt,  f b, f b)

dq(vt, g(), fb)

q(vt, g(), f b)(cid:19)  2q(v1, g1(), fb)

(3.3)

having used dbt vt = 0 dierentiated with respect to t. now it is easy to prove that any
quantity

c = c +

[v, [c, v]],

c = c abab

is such that [ c, v] = 0, i.e. c  v. therefore, using (2.5) applied to vt and using the
adinvariance of the polynomial q, it is easy to see that (3.3) vanishes.

now we recall that

v = lz v,

v0 = 0

(3.4)

and notice that g1() = lzb. therefore we can write

zi

q(vt, f b, f b) = 2d(cid:18)zi

q(vt, g(), f b)  q(v, iz b, fb)(cid:19)

 iz q(v, fb , fb)

2  iz q(v, fb , fb)

a1

2 corresponds to the familiar 2d anomaly. the expression of a1

2 is as follows

a1

2 = 2(cid:16)z dtq(vt, lz bt, bt +
z dtq(vt, [lz vt, vt], fbt ) z dtq(vt, [vt,  vt], fbt )

[vt, [ bt, vt]]) + q(v, iz b, fb)(cid:17)

the last term vanishes since [fbt , vt] = 0.

now let us extract the full anomaly. the chernsimons term is

where q(fb) = q(v, fb , fb), q(fb0) = q(v0, fb0 , fb0 ), and

wtot(v, v0, b, b0) = wq(v, v0, b, b0)(cid:16)q(fb) + q(fb0)(cid:17)
wq(v, v0, b, b0) = 2z dtq(vt, bt +

[vt, [ bt, vt]], fbt )

with standard steps we obtain

wtot = iz (q(fb)q(fb))  dha1

2 (q(fb) + q(fb0)) + wq(v, v0, b, b0)iz q(fb)i

the rst term on the rhs vanishes for dimensional reasons. the term in square bracket
is the anomaly. therefore

anomv = a1

2(q(fb) + q(fb0 )) + wq(v, v0, b, b0)iz q(fb)

(3.7)

the label v is in order to stress that this expression depends on the particular reduction v
we have chosen.

4. the m5brane anomaly cancellation

before we embark in the discussion of anomaly cancellation, let us summarize what we have
done and clarify the role of the background connection a0 in this context. the anomaly
just obtained is the residual m5brane anomaly generated via the descent equations from
the 8form p2(n ), i.e. the second pontryagin class of the normal bundle. for reducible
connections p2(n ) splits into the square of a pfaan. any such splitting can be thought
to correspond to a section v. therefore we can write

n = lv  n 
v

(4.1)

at this point we remark that, if in p2(n ) we consider a connection reducible to so(4) (i.e.
the connection bv introduced above), the second pontryagin class of n becomes:

p2(n ) = p2(n 

v) = e(n 

v)2 = 24 q(v, fb , fb)2

(4.2)

where e represents the euler class. therefore the anomaly we have to cancel is generated
by q(v, fb , fb) and given by (3.7).

it is thanks to the factorization (4.2) that in the previous section we were able to
derive eq.(3.7) for the anomaly, and in this section we are able to cancel it via a suitable
counterterm. at this point however, as partially anticipated in the previous section, we
can take two dierent attitudes.

the rst attitude is based on the idea that one has to restrict the subgroup of rel-
evant dieomorphisms of x to those which, not only map w  w and n  n , but
also preserve the splitting n = lv  n 
in particular preserve v. let us call this

v, i.e.

12

subgroup dif fv(x, n ). now we can safely pick a background connection a0 in n 
it
v:
will remain a connection in any transformed n 
v, as long as the dieomorphisms considered
are those of dif fv(x, n ). they correspond to the automorphisms of a principal ber
bundle p  whose structure group is so(4). with this understanding the anomaly is given
by (3.7) with xed v. this attitude assumes that v has some physical meaning. we recall
that lv represents the direction normal to w which is tangent to y , the manifold which
bounds w . this means therefore that y , or at least a collar which represents the part
of y nearest to w , retains some physical information too. in other words, it would seem
that physical information about the 5brane is not stored only in w but also on y . this
sounds curiously similar to what has been proposed in a dierent context in [14], where
two dierent manifolds terminating on the same spacetime manifold carry dierent phys-
ical information. we shall call this scheme the restricted scheme. this is essentially the
scheme adopted in [7, 8]. another context in which this scheme applies is to describe the
compactication of m theory on a circle s1 along a direction transverse to the 5brane.
in this case the latter becomes the ns 5brane of type iia theory. as pointed out in [4],
the normal bundle to the 5brane then splits into the direct sum of a vector bundle with
structure group so(4) and a trivial line bundle, which actually coincides with the tangent
bundle of the compactication circle. although the construction is not exactly the same as
above, the nal setup is. therefore we can choose a section of the trivial line bundle, say
v, and redo everything without changing a single word. in this case the physical nature of
v is immediately visible.

the second attitude, or general scheme, assumes instead that, although the splitting
n = lv  n 
v has of course a physical meaning, since it represents, via (1.1), the magnetic
coupling of the 5brane to m theory, there is no privileged reductions. therefore we
have to consider all possible vs and integrate over them in the relevant path integral (see
below for further comments on this point). in this case the gauge transformations are all
z  autp , where p is the principal ber bundle with structure group so(5) associated
to n . the intermediate steps in the derivation of the anomaly make sense since we have
seen that a transformation by any z  autp maps a reduction to another reduction and a
reducible connection into another reducible connection. there is no problem either with the
background connection a0 and the background vector v0, which remain xed throughout.
finally the anomaly is again given by (3.7).

4.1 the counterterm

the basis for anomaly cancellation is that e be cohomologically trivial, i.e.

q(v, fb , fb) = dv|w

(4.3)

where v is some 3form eld in the theory. we will discuss in the following subsection
how to relate v to the theory. for the time being let us suppose that it exists and is local.

consistently with (4.3) we set

q(v0, f0, f0) = dv0

(4.4)

13

we have

2  iz q(fb)(cid:17)i

 (v + v0 ) (cid:16)da1

sv =zwhlz v  wq(v, v0, b, b0) + lzv  v0
=zwhiz q(fb)(cid:16)wq(v, v0, b, b0) + v0(cid:17)  iz v  d(cid:16)wq(v, v0, b, b0) + v0(cid:17)
=zwhiz q(fb)wq(v, v0, b, b0)  iz (q(fb)  v)
=zwhiz q(fb)wq(v, v0, b, b0)  (q(fb) + q(fb0 ))a1
2i

+ (v + v0 )  iz q(fb)  (q(fb) + q(fb0))a1

 (q(fb) + q(fb0 ))a1

2i

2i

where v0 need not be a local eld, it may be a purely dierentialgeometric 3form.
moreover, consistently with our denitions and with a0 = 0, we set

v = lzv,

v0 = 0

(4.5)

as we said above, the anomaly we have to cancel is given by (3.7). our proposed

counterterm to cancel it is

sv =zw(cid:16)(v + v0)  wq(v, v0, b, b0) + v  v0(cid:17)

(4.6)

where we have used iz [v  q(fb, fb)] = 0 for dimensional reasons. therefore adding the
counterterm s to the action cancels the residual m5brane anomaly.

the anomaly cancellation works in both restricted and general schemes.

4.2 the nature of v

the previous cancellation mechanism is based on the existence in the mtheory with a
5brane of a 3form eld with the transformation property (1.1). in such a theory there
are several 3forms. from 11 dimensional supergravity we have the 3form c3. on the
5brane we have a 2form b2, by means of which in the interacting theory we can form the
combination h3 = db2  c3. but neither c3 nor h3 can be identied with v, even though
the transformation property would be the right one (4.5): we know that in the absence of
the 5brane we have dc3 = f4, while, when the 5brane is present, f4 is modied in such
a way that (1.1) holds; therefore c3 does not contain any information concerning e.

from this discussion it is evident that v must be constructed out of f4. let us gener-
alize the construction presented in [7]. the section v, which determines the decomposition
n = lv  n 
xi .
in fact v is a section of a line bundle which lies in n and therefore in t x 3. in the following
we will need the equation

v, can be seen as a vector eld on the 11 dimensional space x: v =pi vi 

3we recall that v is a vector eld in x, while v represents a set of scalar elds in w

iv(l)|w = 1

(4.7)

14

where  denotes the thom form on l. to show (4.7), notice that for a generic vector
eld v with nonzero components only along l, iv(l)|w is a nonvanishing function on
w , therefore a suitable rescaling is enough to produce the desired result. whichever the
choice, we remark that what we have achieved so far is the denition of v only on w ;
outside w we can dene it in an arbitrary way.

now, assuming the triviality of q(v, fb , fb), eq.(1.1), given v, is equivalent to the

existence of a local 3form v that solves the equation

in fact using lv = div + ivd we have

lvf4|w = dv

(divf4 + ivdf4)|w = d  ivw |w = dw (v  ivf4|w )

we recall from [7] that w = (n 
with the euler form e of n 

v. then we get

v)(lv) and the thom form (n 

v) can be interchanged

so, nally,

ivw |w = (n 

v) = q(v, fb , fb)

v)(cid:12)(cid:12)w = e(n 

q(v, fb , fb) = dv|w ,

v = v  ivf4

this v satises all the requirements. the form v is left undetermined by our analysis.

4.3 the fate of v

it remains for us to discuss the implications that come for a theory from the presence of
v. in the general scheme, in fact, we have still to explain how we deal with v from a eld
theoretic point of view: what kind of eld is v and what is the path integral treatment of
it beyond the anomaly problem, where v is a spectator?

we summarize what has been said so far: the possible magnetic couplings of the 5
brane inside the mtheory are spanned by the v sections. each v represents a reduction
from the structure group of the normal bundle of w from so(5) to so(4). in view of
this physical input (i.e. the magnetic coupling) it only makes sense to consider reducible
connections, i.e. connections valued in the lie algebra so(5), which, when restricted to the
reduced bundle, are connections valued in the lie subalgebra so(4). given a connection a
in the principal ber bundle p with gauge group so(5), and a section v of the associated
bundle with ber so(5)
so(4) , we can construct a reducible connection bv via (2.3). therefore
the relevant theory is obtained starting from the theory in the eleven dimensional manifold
x coupled to the 5brane with worldvolume w , considering the splitting of the spin
connection of x on w into a tangential and normal part (the latter is exactly a) and
then replacing a everywhere with bv. here we have to be careful about possible jacobian
factors. the measure over a in the path integral is provided by the theory. as for the
measure over v, it is very natural to adopt the measure of the gauge transformations that
map v to a xed section v0 (we have already remarked that, in the process of reducing
the structure group, we trade such gauge transformations for the vs). now, surprisingly

15

enough, the jacobian for the passage from a to bv at xed v is a constant. therefore we
can use, as path integral measure for the theory formulated in terms of bv, the product of
the measure of a and the measure of v.

after dening the relevant path integral measures, let us turn to the action. now
comes the crucial point: as remarked above, although the action is now expressed in terms of
reducible connections, the gauge symmetry group is still so(5) (not simply so(4)), because
an autp transformation (with structure group so(5)) maps a reducible connections into
reducible connections while keeping the the background connection unchanged  we stress
that this is true in the present case, but is not true in general. this is reected in the fact
that we have considered anomalies of autp , not anomalies of the gauge transformations
with group so(4).

next, while computing anomalies, both a and v are spectators. we have seen that
a suitable choice of the counterterm (depending on a and v) allows us to free the theory
from anomalies. the question is now: what do we do next with bv and v? in particular,
what is the fate of v?

if we go on with the path integral quantization, after taking care of the fermions
determinants, it is necessary to x the gauge. a simple way (not necessarily the best one)
to do it is the following. the innitesimal gauge parameters 4 split into the direct sums of
gauge transformations that leave v invariant and the ones that modify v. we can x the
gauge by rst choosing one xed v, say v0, and then xing the remaining so(4) (or, better,
autp  with structure group so(4)) gauge invariance in the ordinary faddeevpopov way5.
in this way we have closed the circle. what was originally a set of gauge degrees
of freedom (i.e., v) have met their fate, that is they have been gaugexed and have
disappeared from the game (except for the remnant v0).

to conclude, it is worth emphasizing the roots of the successful cancellation of the
m5brane anomaly, which originates from the fundamental role played by eq.
(1.1).
this equation entails the normal bundle splitting, which, in turn, implies that the second
pontryagin class of the normal bundle is factorizable as the square of the pfaan. it is
only thanks to such occurrence that we can write down the local counterterm (4.6).

4.4 one nal comment

our approach in this paper is partially onshell. in fact we suppose throughout that (1.1)
it would be interesting to know whether one can extend it to an oshell
be satised.
treatment.
in [15] a local action for the m5brane was proposed that overcomes the
traditional diculty connected with the kinetic term of the selfdual two form of the m
5brane. this is done by introducing additional elds and gauge symmetries so that the
additional degrees of freedom turn out to be pure gauge and the gauge freedom implies
the sought for equations of motion. in [16] this scheme was extended by embedding the
m5brane action into the full action of 11 dimensional supergravity.

4for global gauge transformations it is perhaps necessary to deal with this problem more carefully.
5it would seem that in this way we return to the restricted scheme. this is not so, because we rst make
sure that anomaly are canceled so that the full gauge symmetry is restored, and only afterwards do we x
the gauge.

16

we do not know whether one can deal with the anomaly problem in such more general
framework. however it is interesting to point out some similarities. one of the additional
elds introduced in [16] is an eleven dimensional vector eld u, a section of t x. in the
presence of the 5brane u, restricted to w , splits naturally into two components, one in
the tangent bundle to w and another in the normal bundle. it is natural to identify the
latter components with the section v which is responsible for the reduction of the structure
group of the normal bundle. said otherwise, we can immerse v in the formalism of [16]
by assimilating it to the additional u eld. the latter is then dealt with as a pure gauge
degree of freedom.
