abstract

we consider black strings in ve dimensions and their description as a (4, 0)

cft. the cft moduli space is described explicitly, including its subtle global

structure. bps conditions and global symmetries determine the spectrum of

charged excitations, leading to an entropy formula for near-extreme black holes

in four dimensions with arbitrary charge vector. in the bps limit, this formula

reduces to the quartic e7(7) invariant. the prospects for a description of the

(4, 0) theory as a solvable cft are explored.

1 introduction and summary

the description of black holes as states in certain unitary conformal eld theories

remains one of the highlights of recent progress in string theory (for reviews see

e.g. [1, 2, 3]). the canonical setting for the discussion is the 1+1 dimensional theory

obtained from bound states of d1-branes and d5-branes, with the d5 dimensions

transverse to the d1 wrapped on a small four-manifold t 4 or k3 [4]. this theory
has n = (4, 4) supersymmetry and describes black strings in six dimensions; which
compactify to black holes in ve dimensions. it is clearly of interest to understand

a broader class of theories which are similarly relevant for black holes. the next
simplest example is a conformal eld theory with n = (4, 0) supersymmetry that
describes black strings in ve dimensions, or black holes in four dimensions. this

theory is the subject of the present investigation, which may be considered a sequel

to our previous work on the d1-d5 system [5]; however, we will see that the (4, 0)

theory involves several interesting complications not present in the (4, 4) case.

in the ads/cft correspondence [6] the (4, 4) theory is interpreted as string theory
on ads3s3m [7, 8, 9], where m = t 4 or m = k3. the corresponding interpreta-
tion of the (4, 0) theory involves string theory on the orbifold ads3s3/zzn m [10];
or m-theory on ads3 s2 x [11], where x is some calabi-yau three-fold, for which
we exclusively take x = t 6. the geometries underlying the (4, 4) and (4, 0) theories

are therefore quite similar; however, the (4, 0) theory is more challenging. first of all,

the supersymmetry is reduced; so many properties of the theory are no longer con-

strained by general principles. more profoundly, the electric/magnetic duality, special

to four dimensions, gives rise to new structures that require special considerations.

these interesting structures represent novel elements that have not previously been

analyzed in detail.

there are several specic brane congurations that serve as explicit examples of

backgrounds, analogous to d1/d5 for the (4, 4) theory. one has three m5-branes

intersecting over a common line [12, 13]; another is a type iib conguration with a

fundamental string, a ns5-brane, and a kk-monopole [14, 15]. these backgrounds

are introduced in the beginning of section 3 along with more general families, de-

pending on up to 9 background charges. we use all of these examples repeatedly

1

throughout the paper.

the maximally supersymmetric vacuum in ve dimensions depends on 42 moduli,

parametrizing the coset e6(6)/usp(8) [16]. the backgrounds we consider break some

of the supersymmetry, as discussed above, and also restrict the moduli space by

xing the values of some of the moduli in terms of the background charge vector. in

section 3.4 we discuss this mechanism in detail, giving the xed values of the moduli

explicitly, and enumerating the moduli that remain undetermined. there are 28 such
free moduli, parametrizing the coset f4(4)/su(2)  usp(6) [17, 10].

this discussion determines the local geometry of the moduli space of the cfts,

but the global structure requires more care [18, 5]. in the (4, 4) theory the essential

subtlety is captured by a subspace of moduli space which is locally isomorphic to the

coset sl(2, ir)/u(1), which can be parametrized by the complex iib string coupling.

in this subspace the global identications are described by the group 0(n = q1q5),

acting on the moduli space from the left [5]. these identications form a genuine

subgroup of the sl(2, zz) identications under iib s-duality. in section 3.6, we de-

velop the corresponding description for the (4, 0) theory. we nd that the essential

structure of moduli space is captured by the ve dimensional coset sl(3, ir)/so(3).

again, the global identications are a genuine subgroup of the nave expectation

sl(3, zz). other features of the moduli space are also described explicitly in terms of

the sl(3, ir)/so(3) subspace of moduli space.

a key feature of our discussion is the scaling limit introduced in section 2.

in

this limit the (4, 0) theory decouples from the ambient environment [19]. an im-

portant distinction arises between the branes that are interpreted as sources of the

background, and those that are charged excitations. the spectrum of the charged

excitations is one of our main interests; it is the topic of section 4. we nd a total

of 27 charges. a part of their spectrum is similar to that of perturbative wind-

ing/momentum charges on three independent four-tori; altogether this sector de-

scribes 24 charges. the remaining 3 charges are the electric duals of the three

magnetically charged branes that are the sources of the background. these 3

charges are special to the (4, 0) theory, and their spectrum is more complicated. we

nd their conformal weights using a combination of bps algebra and global symme-

tries. the results are then used in section 4.3 to compute the entropy of a large class

2

of near-extremal black holes, depending on an arbitrary charge vector in addition to

independent mass and angular momentum parameters. the corresponding classical

black holes have not yet been constructed in general, and their area is not known.

however, our formula for the entropy reduces in the bps-limit to the quartic invariant

of e7(7), as it should. this result provides a fairly intricate test of our microscopic

description.

one of the goals of the present investigation is to learn more about the full cft

underlying the system. it is known that the (4, 4) theory is described in a region of

moduli space by a solvable cft, namely a sigma-model with a symmetric product

orbifold as target space [4]. the (4, 0) theory is understood in signicantly less detail.

for example, it is not known whether there is an underlying solvable cft and, if

so, in what region of moduli space it would be applicable. in the bps limit many

properties are constrained from general principles and a formula has been proposed

for the spectrum [20]; however, many features remain mysterious. we nd several

new facts about the theory which may be helpful in identifying a solvable limit. in

section 5 we explore the possibility of a description in terms of a relatively modest

variation on the symmetric product idea. our results are consistent with this working

assumption; however, we have not succeeded in determining the precise theory.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we describe the scaling limit dening

a theory decoupled from gravity. this leads to the fundamental distinction between

branes that are considered part of the background, and those that are excitations. the

following sections 3 and 4 describe properties of the background and the excitations,

respectively. each of these sections has a fairly large number of subsections, focussing

on specic features. in section 5, we discuss our attempts towards a description of

the (4, 0) theory as a solvable cft. finally, appendix a contains the computation

of the basic spectrum of excitations.

2 the scaling limit

we consider four dimensional vacua with maximal supersymmetry; in other words m-

theory on t 7. this theory has 56 u(1) charges: 21 from wrapped m5-branes, 21 from

wrapped m2-branes, 7 kk-momenta, and 7 kk-monopoles. the m2/m5 branes and

3

the kk-momenta/kk-monopoles form dual pairs under electric/magnetic duality in

four dimensions.

we are interested in a scaling limit where a theory without gravity decouples form

the bulk. the limit is most conveniently introduced on a rectangular torus where it

can be dened as [21]:

lp  0 with r1,   , r6  lp r7  1 .

(1)

the undemocratic treatment of the toroidal radii introduces a hierarchy among the

u(1) charges which is of central importance for our considerations. this is seen by

inspecting the masses of isolated objects that carry each of the 56 u(1) charges3:

(5)

in the scaling limit the most massive excitations have mass of order l3

p ; they are
the kk monopoles with kk direction along the large dimension r7. the m2- and

m5-branes wrapping r7, and the kk-monopole not wrapping r7 have masses of
order l2

p ; there are 6 + 15 + 6 = 27 such excitations. the m2-branes and m5-
branes not wrapping r7 and the kk momentum along any direction except r7 have
masses of order l1

p ; there are also 6 + 15 + 6 = 27 of these  as there must be, by

electric/magnetic duality. finally, the kk momentum along r7 has nite mass.

it is sometimes useful to consider the eective ve-dimensional theory which cor-

responds to avoiding compactication along the large dimension r7 altogether. in
this theory the superheavy kk monopoles (with m  l3
p ) do not exist; this is one
of the reasons that we do not consider these objects in this work. the excitations

with mass of order l2

p correspond to strings, particles, and waves in the
eective ve-dimensional theory. they transform under the ve-dimensional duality

p , l1

p , and l0

group e6(6) as 27, 27, and 1. the reason that the hierarchy is fundamental for our

considerations is that the objects enter very dierently in the microscopic descrip-

tion: the excitations with mass of order l2

p are interpreted as background
elds, charged excitations in the background theory, and neutral chiral excitations.

p , l1

p , and l0

section 3 is devoted to a discussion of the background, and section 4 considers the

remaining u(1) charges, as excitations of the theory governing the background.

the discussion above was for rectangular tori. a more general set of moduli can be

restored without further complications, as long as the eective ve-dimensional nature

of the conguration is respected. this allows for 21 components of a general metric
gij (i, j,   = 1,   6), 20 components of the three-form eld cijk (i, j,   = 1,   6),
and the pseudo-scalar e123456.
(eijklm n is obtained as the potential dual of the
3-form eld cjkl.) these 42 scalars parametrize the coset space e6(6)/usp(8), as

expected in a maximally supersymmetric vacuum in ve dimensions.

3 the background

the background is chosen such that it preserves precisely 1/8 of susy. this condition

ensures that the eective theory after decoupling is a conformal eld theory (cft)

in 1 + 1 dimensions, and also that excitations of the background correspond at strong

coupling to regular black holes in 3 + 1 dimensions. duality of supergravity ensures

that all backgrounds preserving 1/8 susy are classically equivalent; in fact, they all
correspond to the near-horizon geometry ads3s2t 6. that this classical symmetry
generalizes to the full quantum description is part of the conjecture embodied in m-

theory.

3.1 the canonical backgrounds

in explicit computations it is useful to choose a specic background. one example is

three m5-branes that intersect over a string, with the string aligned along the large

dimension (of length r7) [12, 13]:

an advantage of this representation is that it exhibits many symmetries of the situa-

tion explicitly. for example, a triality of the three background objects is immediately

apparent. this background will be our main example.

another example is a type iib string conguration with a kk-monopole, an ns5

brane, and a perturbative string f 1. it is [14, 15]:

where the  denotes the taub-nut direction of the kk-monopole. an advantage of
this representation is its close relation to the d1/d5 system. (the f 1/ns5 in the

background becomes d1/d5 after type iib s-duality.) moreover, it is purely ns; so

one may consider worldsheet string theory in this background [10]. note that in the

type iib representation it is r6 which is large.

the two examples given above are related by the duality chain:

(6)

results obtained in one representation can be translated to the other using this se-

quence of transformations.

3.2 more general backgrounds

it is often important to consider more general backgrounds. the most general case

with all 27 background branes turned on is unfortunately quite complicated. in this

section we introduce an intermediate situation where one can turn on 9 dierent back-

ground branes, while still keeping things explicit. the construction will be exploited

repeatedly in the sequel.

6

the idea is that e6(6) has a maximal subgroup sl(3)sl(3)sl(3), with the 27
decomposing as (3, 3, 1) + (1, 3, 3) + (3, 1, 3). these three sets of background charges

can be thought of as matrices:

as well as:

in these formulae the zij are the integer number of m2-branes wrapping the corre-

sponding cycles; the pi are kk-monopoles wrapping the compact space, with i the

monopole circle; and the qij are m5-branes with the indices reering to the dual cycle
on the t 7. the e6 cubic invariant specializes to the sum of the determinants of these

three matrices.

the charge matrices (7-9) are related by discrete symmetries. first, the exchange

of even and odd subspaces interchanges qo and qe; and takes q5  qt

(10)

(11)

taken together, these tranformations generate a triality map between any two sets of

nine charges above.

under the decomposition e6(6)  sl(3)3, the maximal compact subgroup decom-
poses as usp(8)  so(3)3. a conveniently described subspace of moduli space is
therefore [sl(3)/so(3)]3. in the present construction we focus on these 15 moduli,

7

and turn the remaining ones o. this restriction is such that explicit computations

remain possible, with results that are representative of the general case with 42 mod-

uli.

two of the three sl(3)/so(3) cosets are the unit volume metrics g2i,2j and
g2i1,2j1 on the three-subtori of even and odd cycles. these metrics are conve-
niently written using vielbeins as g = et  e, for which we choose an sl(3)/so(3)
coset representative of the form e = a n, where a is diagonal with unit determinant
and n is upper triangular with unit diagonal. henceforth we will drop the hats,

remembering that the metrics are of unit normalization. the last sl(3)/so(3) sub-

space is parametrized by the volumes v135, v246 and constant three-form elds c135,
c246 on the even and odd subtori, as well as the six-form modulus e123456. the viel-
bein parametrization is also convenient for describing this part of the moduli space,

for which we may write:

e5 = (v246/v135)1/6

the discrete symmetries also act simply on the moduli. the exchange of odd

and even cycles interchanges go and ge; and transforms g5 as g5  g1

3.3 the mass of the background

the mass formula for a general background is some e6(6) invariant combination of the

charges which is necessarily quite complicated. however, in the various special cases

considered in sections (3.1-3.2) the details can be carried out explicitly. the most

general mass formula follows in principle, by acting on the charges and the moduli

with dualities.

we rst consider the canonical m5-brane background. on a rectangular torus

the mass of is simply m = q12 + q34 + q56, the sum of the constituent masses;

but in general the mass depends nontrivially on the moduli. in fact, it is a general

8

phenomenon that, in the presence of any conguration of branes, the parity-odd

moduli induce additional charges that are not navely present. for a general four-

dimensional conguration this eect can be taken into account by the shifts [22]:

(16)

where i, j,   = 1,   , 7, and we use the notation qijklm  1
2ijklm n oqn o. we
are interested in the special case where the background is three intersecting m5-branes

and, as explained in the end of section 2, the moduli are restricted so that the large

dimension r7 does not mix with the others. after these specializations the shifts in

the charges simplify dramatically, especially because there are no kk-monopoles in

the background. the only nontrivial induced charges are:

z i7 =

1
3!

cjklqijkl7 .

(17)

the mass of the background m5-branes in a vacuum with general moduli can be

derived by considering the eect of these induced charges, and further take a gen-

eral o-diagonal metric into account. after computations similar to those given in

appendix a we nd:

where:

m 2 = q2

12 + q2

56 + (

x 2 = q2

+q2

56(q2

34 + ( z37)2 + ( z47)2) + 2q12q34q56m .

(18)

(19)

these expressions give a quartic equation for the mass which cannot in general be

further simplied. as they stand, (18-19) presume diagonal metric on the compact

torus; however, they can be covariantized to take o-diagonal metrics into account.

9

we can also construct the mass formula for the more general background discussed

in section (3.2). in this case invariants under duality are constructed in matrix form,

simply remembering which sl(3)s act on the left and right. for the background

charges, we have for the half-bps contribution to the mass squared:

m 2

#2
0 = " r7(v135v246)2/3

eg5i + trhq5g1

l6

5g1

e i(cid:17) ,

(20)

which gives the sum of squares of the background charges with their appropriate

dependence on moduli. this expression is covariant under motions in moduli space.

also note that the three terms are permuted by interchange of odd and even cycles,

and by the sequence of dualities (10).

3.4 fixed scalars

the background branes are situated in a vacuum described by 42 scalar moduli,

parametrizing the coset e6(6)/usp(8). however, in the decoupling limit the value of

some of these scalars are determined in terms of the background charges; these are

the xed scalars. the remaining moduli, which remain undetermined, will be referred

to as free moduli.

the xed scalars can be characterized in general using the n = 2 supersymmetry

of the eective d = 5 theory. the general rule is that the scalars in the hyper-

multiplets remain free moduli in the near-horizon theory, while the scalars in the

vector-multiplets acquire a mass and become xed scalars [23]. in the toroidal com-

pactication considered here there are 14 vector-multiplets and 7 hyper-multiplets.

the vector-multiplets each have a single scalar and the hyper-multiplets each have

four scalars; so this gives 14 xed scalars and 28 free moduli. the free moduli
parametrize the coset f4(4)/su(2)  usp(6) [17, 10].

the physical distinction between xed scalars and free moduli is exhibited clearly

by minimizing the mass of the background over the full moduli space. the scalars

determined this way are the xed scalars; those that remain arbitrary are the free

moduli.

10

the m5 background: to see explicitly how this works, consider the m5-brane

background. in the simple case of a rectangular torus with vanishing c-elds, the

mass is:

m =

=

r7
l6
p
r7(v12v34v56)2/3

)1/3q12! ,

where (2)2vij is the volume of the 2-torus spanning the (ij) cycle and, as before, and

qij is the number of m5-branes wrapping the corresponding dual cycle. the coecient

of the second equation is invariant under the dualitites of the eective d = 5 theory,

and so should not be varied. the expression in the large bracket depends only on the

two independent ratios v12/v34 and v34/v56. minimizing over these gives:

v12
v34
v34
v56

=

q12
q34
q34
q56

,

.

(22)

(23)

a more symmetric form of the conditions is obtained by noting that the product of

the equations gives v12/v56 = q12/q56. it is simple to verify these values for the xed

scalars by writing the explicit solutions using the harmonic function rule, and taking

the near horizon limit.

we now summarize the results for more general moduli. first consider the met-

ric, in the language of complex manifolds. the background m5-branes determine

a holomorphic structure on the six-torus, pairing the indices (12), (34), and (56).

the components of the kahler metric g are the scalars in vector-multiplets, and

therefore xed scalars. an exception is the overall volume v = detg which is a
free modulus. (it forms a hypermultiplet together with the free modulus e123456 and
two components of the three-form eld.) the complex structure g + h.c. forms 3

hyper-multiplets which give 12 free moduli. altogether the 21 metric components

therefore give 8 xed scalars and 13 free moduli.

next, consider the three-form eld. expanding the mass determined through (18)

for small zi gives:

m =

2

~z

.

1
4q

11

(24)

this shows that the mass has a local minimum when the induced m2 brane charge
zi = 0. it is clear from (17) that there are only 6 linear combinations of cijk that
induce non-trivial m2-brane charge; this gives 6 xed scalar conditions, made explicit

as follows. divide the indices into three sets in accordance with the holomorphic

structure, i.e. (12), (34), (56). there are 8 components of cijk that have one index

in each set; all these are free moduli. the remaining 12 components each have two

indices within one of the sets, and the remaining index in a dierent set, e.g. c125.
the 6 elds of this kind that are selfdual on the t 4 transverse to the unpaired index

are xed scalars, their anti-selfdual partners are free moduli. for example, c125 +c345
is a xed scalar, but c125  c345 is a free modulus.

in summary, the 14 xed scalars are 8 components of the metric and 6 components

of the three-form eld; and the 28 free moduli are 13 components of the metric, 14
components of the three-form, and the 1 pseudoscalar e123456.

another way of stating the xed scalar conditions is that the three physical charges

are identical:

q12 = q34 = q56  q =

r11
l6
p

v

2

3 (q12q34q56)

1

3 ,

(25)

where the volume v = v12v34v56. the mass of the background at the xed scalar

point is mx = 3q.

the type iib background: the distinction between xed scalars and free mod-

uli is in some ways simpler in the type iib f1/ns5/kk-monopole background, so we

sketch the results in this case too. on a rectangular torus simple minimization, as

above, gives two obvious xed scalars:

r2
5 =
v4
g2
s

=

q5
qk
q1
q5

,

,

(26)

(27)

where r5 the radius of the kk-monopole direction in string units, v4 is the volume
of the internal t 4 also in string units, and gs is the string coupling constant. these

xed scalar conditions agree with the result of simply reading o the near-horizon

values of the explicit metric, written using the harmonic function rule.

more generally, consider the 26 ns scalars e6 and gij + bij (with i, j = 1,   5).
of these, 20 are free moduli, namely gij + bij with i = 1,   , 4 and j = 1,   , 5;

12

these parametrize the coset so(4, 5)/so(4)  so(5). the remaining 6 ns-moduli
are xed scalars. on a rectangular torus this was shown explicitly for g55 and e6
above, and for gi5  bi5 in [10].

the 16 rr scalars can be represented as a formal sum of forms  + c (2) + a. the

anti-selfdual part of this form are 8 xed scalars, and the selfdual part gives 8 free
3! ijklajkl
moduli. in components, the xed scalars are cij and   a1234 and ci5  1
with i, j    = 1,   , 4; and the free rr-moduli are given by similar expressions, but
with relative signs ipped.

5

altogether there are 6 + 8 = 14 xed scalars and 20 + 8 = 28 free moduli, as there

should be.

more general backgrounds: as a nal example of the determination of xed

scalars, we consider the more general backgrounds discussed in section (3.2). for a

given choice of 9 charges there are two sets of moduli that are relevant; for example,

for the pure m5 congurations represented by the matrix q5, both the odd and the

even metric couple, for a total of 10 moduli; or for the backgrounds involving qo, one

needs go and g5.

the xed scalars are determined by extremizing the mass formula for the back-

ground. in the present case there are no parity-odd moduli so the induced charges

(17) vanish. the mass formula becomes:

m 2 = m 2

0 + 2x ,

where m 2

0 was given in (20) and:

x 2 = (cid:16)tr[q5g1
o qt

5g1

e ](cid:17)2

 tr[(q5g1

o qt

5g1

e )2] + 2det(q5)m .

(28)

(29)

the determinant of q5 does not depend on the moduli, and both m 2

0 and x 2 depend
e . the mass m therefore depends only
on y , as far as its dependence on moduli is concerned. now, one can check that the

only on the combination y = q5g1

o qt

5g1

trace of any power of the quantity tr[y n] is extremized by:

go = qt

5g1
e

q5

,

q5 = q5/det[q5]1/3 .

(30)

it follows that, whatever the exact expression for the mass in terms of y , its extremum

is (30). this shows that, of the two sl(3)/so(3) cosets that are active in the 9

13

charge background, the xed scalar equations determine one in terms of the other.

in the subspace of moduli space considered here there are thus ve free moduli, and

we are able to nd the relation to the other ve active moduli explicitly.

3.5

instability under fragmentation

as discussed in section 3.3, the mass depends nonlinearly on the charges at generic

points in moduli space. the background is only unstable under fragmentation when

its mass is equal to the sum of its constituent masses so this eect is sucient to sta-

bilize the conguration. the surface of instability is therefore some lower-dimensional

surface in moduli space [24].

the m5-background: to characterize this surface explicitly, consider (24) for the

mass due to induced charges. in the ground state of the background the xed scalar
conditions tune these charges to zero, e.g z 1 = c 134q34 + c 156q56 = 0. however, the
ratio of charges q34/q56 is generally dierent for each of the fragments in the nal

state, so the decay products are heavier than they would be for vanishing three-form

eld. this is the eect that stabilizes the background conguration at generic points

in moduli space.

in order for fragmentation to be allowed, there are 6 conditions

of this sort on the three-form eld, and 6 additional conditions that arise similarly

from the xed scalar equations for the o-diagonal metric. more precisely there are

three hyper-multiplets (with four scalars apiece) that each protect against emission

of two kinds of charges, but not the third. if any two of the hyper-multiplets vanish

the conguration is unstable. the surface of instability is therefore a codimension 8

subspace of moduli space.

it follows from this reasoning that the background is unstable everywhere in moduli

space, when all the decay products have the same ratios of charges as the initial state.

we avoid this degenerate possibility throughout this work, by assuming that the three

background charges are mutually prime.

the type iib background:

it is simpler to characterize the surface of instability

in the canonical type iib conguration f1/ns5/kk-monopole. here it is manifest

that there is a linearly realized so(5, 4) symmetry acting on the 20 free ns-moduli

14

gij + bij (with i = 1,   , 5, j = 1,   , 4). these moduli do not aect the linear
dependence of the mass formula on the charges, so turning on these moduli does not

prevent fragmentation. the rr-moduli are quite dierent: they enter nonlinearly

in the way discussed explicitly above for the canonical m5-brane conguration. one

component of the co-dimension 8 surface of instability is therefore precisely the surface

where the 8 free rr-moduli vanish. it is parametrized by the 20 free ns-moduli.

3.6 the global structure of moduli space

the 28 free moduli parametrize a moduli space which is locally the non-compact
coset f4(4)/su(2)  usp(6) . the purpose of this subsection is to discuss the global
structure of this space. naively, one might expect to be able to quotient by f4(4)(zz)

but, as explained in [18, 5] for the d1-d5 case, this group is too large  it does not

leave the set of background masses invariant.

an explicit prescription of the identications for the d1-d5 system was given in [5].
there, the local structure of the moduli space is so(5, 4)/so(5)  so(4). it is suf-
cient to consider a representative sl(2, zz)  sl(2, zz) subgroup of the so(5, 4, zz)
duality group. under this subgroup, a given pair of d1-d5 charges (q1, q5) can be

mapped to a canonical background (n = q1q5, 1). the global identications of the

moduli space are those that preserve the charge vector of the canonical background.

this subgroup of so(5, 4; zz) is generated by a particular diagonal 0(n) subgroup of
sl(2, zz) sl(2, zz), together with conjugations by elements of the t-duality group.
the interesting part of the structure can be projected onto the sl(2, ir)/so(2) sub-

space of the moduli space acted on by one of the sl(2, zz)s; the fundamental domain
projected onto this subspace is then 0(n)\sl(2, ir)/so(2). the moduli space has a
cusp for each factorization of n into one-brane and ve-brane charges q1, q5 = n/q1,

where there is a weakly-coupled (large target space) sigma model description of the

dynamics. the singular locus, where the d1-d5 bound state can fragment into its

constituents, is a codimension four subspace of the moduli space where the sigma

model description breaks down (even at large volume) due to singularities in its tar-

get space. under the projection, the singular loci consist of geodesics running between

conjugate cusps for d1-d5 charges (q, n/q) and (n/q, q).

one can employ the same strategy in the present context; now the sl(3, zz)3

15

subgroup of e6(6)(zz) duality is representative. many features carry through. first of

all, consider a vebrane charge matrix (9):

q5 = 


q12

0

0

0

q34

0

0

0

q56




.

(31)

this can be mapped to a canonical background q5 = diag[n = q12q34q56, 1, 1] via
the sl(3, zz)  sl(3, zz) transformation q5  glq5gt

r, with:

gl = 

gr =

caq34

a






,

,

(32)

where the coecients satisfy:

adq56 + bcq34 = adq34q56 + bcq12 = 1 .

(33)

for the existence and uniqueness of this transformation for any (q12, q34, q56) with

q12q34q56 = n, we require that the prime decomposition of n contain any given prime

no more than once. without loss of generality, one can set e.g. a = b = a = b = 1.

the canonical charge matrix is preserved by further transformations generated by a

copy of 0(n):

gl = 

gr =

(34)

together with the sl(2, zz) that acts in the lower right corner. the xed scalar

conditions identify the moduli subspaces acted on by the left and right sl(3, zz)

duality subgroups; the identications of this ve-dimensional space under the action

of g is representative of the global structure of the moduli space, just as in the d1-d5

16

case. the full residual duality group hn  f4(4)(zz) is generated (in the iib frame
where the background charges are purely ns) by the subgroup of sl(3, zz) analogous

to the above, together with t-duality transformations so(5, 4; zz).

the singular locus in this subspace are the diagonal matrices in sl(3, ir)/so(3),

since then there is no projection of any given vebrane charge onto the worldvolume
of another. from the a  n decomposition, one sees that this is a two-dimensional
geodesic submanifold of the ve-dimensional homogeneous space. there will be such

a submanifold for any unordered triple of vebrane charges (q12, q34, q56), which gets

mapped to a unique geodesic submanifold under the transformation (32) to the canon-

ical background. the generic point on the boundary boundary of sl(3, ir)/so(3)

is reached when a = diag[1, 2, 3] (with 123 = 1) has one of its eigenvalues
degenerate, say 1  . clearly this can happen to any one of the three i, with
the possibilities permuted by the action of the weyl group in sl(3); this is why

the singular loci correspond to unordered triples of constituent charges, since each of

these degenerations belongs to the same geodesic submanifold but dierent orderings

of the qi.

the singular loci corresponding to dierent unordered triples (q12, q34, q56) do not

intersect, by the same argument given in [5] for the d1-d5 system. take the back-

ground charges to be those of f1/ns5/kk-monopoles in the type iib description.

in this case, the singular locus corresponds to vanishing of all rr moduli, and is

left invariant only by t-duality transformations so(5, 4; zz). assume that there is a

nontrivial intersection, in the canonical background, of the codimension eight singu-

lar subspaces corresponding to two dierent unordered triples of background charges.

pull a point on the intersection back to the original background by the maps specied

by one of the two charge sets. the resulting point is parametrized only by ns moduli;

but the charges (q12, q34, q56) and (q12, q34, q56) cannot be related by t-duality, so we
conclude that the singular loci corresponding to dierent unordered triples of charges

are disjoint.

17

4 the charged excitations

in any background preserving 1/8 of susy there is a rich variety of charged excita-

tions, as discussed in section 2. the exploration of this spectrum is one way to learn

about the structure of the theory governing the background.

4.1

introduction to the spectrum of charges

one of the most basic properties of the charged excitations is their spectrum, i.e.

the energy as a function of the charge vector. in this section we present heuristic

arguments that motivate the spectrum in the case of a rectangular torus; a more

precise computation is given in appendix a.

consider the type iib f1/ns5/kk-monopole background and include momentum

along the fundamental string. the mass of this system is simply the sum of constituent

masses:

m = qk + q5 + | ~q1 + ~ptot| .

(35)

in this formula we have exploited the rotational invariance of the ns5/kk-monopole
world-volume to allow a general direction of the vector ~q1 + ~ptot. in the scaling limit
the component of this vector along the large dimension r6 is dominant; it corre-

sponds to the background fundamental string with charge q1, and a neutral chiral
excitation. we denote the remaining four components ~wf 1 + ~p ; these correspond to
charged excitations. after expansion, the energy of the charged excitations becomes:

e =

1

2q1

( ~wf 1 + ~p )2 .

(36)

an important qualitative consequence of this result is that the charged excitations

have nite energy in the environment created by the background, even though their

masses in at ambient space diverge in the scaling limit. it is shown in appendix a

that the expression (36) remains valid for general orientations of the charge vectors
~wf 1, ~p .

the duality st1234s leaves the background invariant, except for the interchange
of two charges q1  q5. thus (36) implies that the theory has excitations with the
spectrum:

e =

1

2q5

( ~wd1 + ~wd3)2 ,

18

(37)

where ~wd1 is the charge vector of d1-branes wrapping 1234; and the ~wd3 denote
three-branes wrapped within 1234, with the vector index being the direction that is

not wrapped. the further duality t15 similarly leads to the spectrum:

e =

1

2qk

( ~wd + ~w d)2 ,

where the charge vectors are:

~wd = (d15, d3125, d3135, d3145) ,
~w d = (d512345, d3345, d3245, d3235) .

(38)

(39)

(40)

recall from section 2 that the total number of u(1) charges is 27. the formulae

above gives the energy of 24 of these. the remaining three charges are more compli-

cated, because they are the electric-magnetic duals of the charges that appear in the

background. the spectrum of these special charges:

espec =

1

2(q1 + q5 + qk)

(f5 + p5 + n12345)2 ,

(41)

is derived in appendix a. it is also shown that the energy of a conguration with

general charge vector is the sum of the special cases considered above. the nal result

for the energy of excitations with general charge vector therefore becomes:

e =

1

2q1

( ~wf 1 + ~p )2 +

1

2q5

( ~wd1 + ~wd3)2 +

1

2qk

( ~wd + ~w d)2

+

1

2(q1 + q5 + qk)

(f5 + p5 + n12345)2 .

(42)

microscopic units: so far we have used physical units where the charge is identical

to the mass of an isolated brane and is denoted by a capital letter. the microscopic

units instead count the number of branes and are denoted by lower-case letters. in

these units the energy (42) becomes:

r6e =

+

6q1q5qk

(f5q5 + p5qk + n12345q1)2 ,

(43)

where, in each of the rst terms, a sum over the index i is implied after taking the

square. the last term (containing the special u(1) charges) was rewritten using the

19

xed scalar equations (26-27). the ri are radii of the compact dimensions in string

units (i.e. ri = ri/ls where ls = ), v4  r1r2r3r4, and ei = 1

v4

(1, r1r2, r1r3, r1r4).

it is important to note that the scale of the energy is set by the radius of the large

dimension r6.

the m5-background:

it is straightforward to nd the corresponding formulae for

the three m5-branes intersecting over a line, e.g. using the duality (6). the result is:

e =

2q56 h(z13 + z24)2 + (z14 + z32)2 + (p5 + q67)2 + (p6 + q57)2i

1

2q12 h(z35 + z46)2 + (z36 + z54)2 + (p1 + q27)2 + (p2 + q17)2i
2q34 h(z15 + z26)2 + (z16 + z25)2 + (p3 + q47)2 + (p4 + q37)2i

1

1

+

+

+

1

2(q12 + q34 + q56)

(z12 + z34 + z56)2 ,

(44)

where zij are the charges of the m2-branes wrapping the (ij) cycle, pi is the momen-

tum along ri, and qij denote ve-branes transverse to the (ij) cycle. the intersecting

m5 background makes the systematics of the energy formula clearer: the 3 special

u(1) charges are the m2-branes that are electric duals of the magnetic back-

ground m5s. the 8 u(1) charges that are weighted by a given background m5

(q12, q34, or q56) are the m2s that do not share an index with the background m5;

and kk-excitations and light m5s that do. these statements translate into simple

geometric relations.

4.2 currents and lattices

the purpose of this section is to take a rst step towards an interpretation of the

charged spectrum (43). the working assumption is that the spectrum arises as the

0-modes of ane currents in the underlying conformal eld theory. the ads/cft

correspondence [6], as implemented for ads3 in [25, 26, 27], shows that this is the

correct interpretation for the perturbative currents; non-perturbative dualities then

suggest that all currents arise in this way.

consider the rst three terms of (43). these terms have the structure of 12 u(1)

currents in the right-moving sector, 4 currents at each level q1, q5, and qk. modular

20

invariance of the cft then requires a matching set of 12 left-moving currents with

spectrum:

r6el =

1
2q5

(wd1

i

ri
v4  ~wd3

v4
ri )2 +

1
2qk

(wd

i eiwi

d/ei)2 . (45)

taken together, the right- and left-moving currents form a simple lattice of signature

(12, 12). the right-moving currents are invariant under the duality t1234; the left-

moving ones change sign. it is important to note that these results are reliable only

in the semiclassical regime: there is no supersymmetry in the left-moving sector, so

the formula (45) can not be interpreted as a bps formula. it can therefore receive

corrections; in particular, the levels may receive contributions at the subleading order

in the background charge.

next, we turn attention to the three special charges, appearing in the last line
of (43). an important constraint on these is that the cft has a global su(2) 
usp(6) symmetry [28]. the full set of charges transforms in the 27 of usp(8) which
decomposes as (2, 6) (1, 14) (1, 1) under su(2) usp(6) . the global su(2) acts
on the supersymmetries, so the (2, 6) is identied with the 12 right-moving charges.

more generally, the energy formula (43) is the extremality condition on the right-

moving charges. this identies a specic linear combination of the special charges as

right-moving; and we further note that this combination is the singlet (1, 1) under
su(2) usp(6). at this point we have yet to account for the 12 left-moving currents
with spectrum given in (45), and two linear combinations of the special charges.
these must transform as (1, 14) under the su(2)  usp(6) global symmetry and
this property determines the spectrum of the special charges as:

r6espec

l =

1

2q1q5qk

(f5q5  p5qk)2 +

1

6q1q5qk

(f5q5 + p5qk  2n12345q1)2 .

(46)

the rst term in this equation is the dual of the rst term in (45), after the xed

scalar condition (26) is taken into account. this expresses the perturbative so(5, 4)

duality. the second term is determined as the linear combination of charges that are

orthogonal both to the perturbative charges in the rst term, and the usp(6) singlet;

it must be normalized as the other elements in the 14 of usp(6). as a further check

on (46), note that the total left moving weight is symmetric under triality of the

charges, an obvious symmetry in the m-representation.

21

in addition to the 27 u(1) charges there is the bulk angular momentum of the dual

black hole in ve dimensions. this charge is interpreted in the cft as a component

of the su(2) r-charge, with normalization xed by the supersymmetry algebra [29,

30, 20]. the total spectrum of the special right-moving charges therefore becomes:

r6espec

r =

1

2q1q5qk

j 2 +

1

6q1q5qk

(f5q5 + p5qk + n12345q1)2 .

(47)

there is an obvious similarity between (46) and (47). this suggests that the special

currents are incorporated into the (12, 12) lattice found previously so, altogether, the

currents form a (14, 14) lattice.

there are two peculiar features of the spectrum of excitations (47) carrying the

special charge: first of all, the normalization diers by a factor of two relative to the

other currents (in particular the last term in (46)); secondly, although this special

charge appears in the right-moving energy, it is associated to the graviphoton tower
of supergravity on ads3s2, which has the opposite chirality (it is left-moving)4 [28,
31]. nevertheless, these results are dictated by bps algebra and global symmetries.

4.3 black hole entropy

the excitations that we consider correspond at strong coupling to regular black holes.

it is known that the microscopic (statistical) entropy of these black holes agrees with

the bekenstein-hawking area formula, when only the scalar charge (momentum) is

excited. it is interesting to generalize this agreement to the case where the additional

u(1) charges are included as well. we carry out the computation in the type iib

background, on a rectangular torus. some elements of the more general computation

are discussed in appendix 4.5, and others are given in [5].

conformal field theory: for a general background the central charge of the

underlying cft is proportional to the unique cubic invariant of e6(6) that can be

formed from the charge vectors in the fundamental representation 27. for the present

purposes it is sucient to consider the canonical f1/ns5/kk-monopole background;

then the central charge is simply c = 6q1q5qk.

4the latter fact appears to violate the rule of thumb that the singleton sector can be obtained

by extending the range of the mode index in the kk tower.

22

the operators of the theory have left and right conformal weights hl,r = 1

2 ( p6)
where  is the total energy. in a sector with a specied u(1) charge vector the typical

vertex operator can be written:

vtot = virr vu(1) ,

(48)

where vu(1) carries the required u(1) charge and virr is neutral, but otherwise arbi-

trary. this shows how a part of the conformal weight is expended on exciting the u(1)

charges. the unspecied neutral excitations provide the microscopic degeneracy. the

corresponding irreducible conformal weights are:

(52)

(53)

the area formula: the entropy formula should be compared with the entropy

that follows from the area of the corresponding macroscopic black holes. however,

the classical solutions needed are dicult to construct, and the task has not been

completed. the dicult features are those related to the special charges, i.e. the

magnetic duals of the background charges.

in the nonrotating case, a generating

solution has been constructed which in principle contains the required data [32].

however, it is given in a form which makes the area formula hard to disentangle;

for discussion and further references see [33]. in view of these problems we restrict

ourselves to the bps-limit hirr

r = j = 0 where the black hole entropy is known on

general grounds. it is [34]:

where j4 is the quartic invariant of e7(7):

s = qj4 ,

(54)

 j4 = xijyjkxklyli 
the invariant is written in the so(8) formalism where the central charges can be

immediately identied with wrapped branes [35]. in m-theory notation the map is
xab = zab, xa8 = pa, yab = qab, ya8 = pa where the indices a, b,   = 1,   , 7. after
specializing to the background with three m5s intersecting over a line, with further

u(1) charges turned on, this becomes5:

j4 = 4q12q34q56p7

+4q34q56hq57p6 + q67p5 + z13z24 + z14z23i

+2q12z12q34z34 + 2q12z12q56z56 + 2q56z56q34z34 .

(56)

the area formula (54), with the reduced quartic invariant (56), is identical to the

microscopic expression (52) after dualities. this agreement gives some condence

that the conformal weights have been correctly identied also in the non-bps case.

5the signs are not strictly in accord with (55). the convention in this paper is to assign brane

(vs. anti-brane) numbers so that a maximal number of terms contribute positively to the entropy;

this simplies dualities.

24

4.4 parity-odd moduli

the discussion of the spectrum of charged excitations so far assumed a choice of mod-

uli corresponding to a rectangular torus. it is straightforward to generalize and take

into account o-diagonal metric components on the compact space: simply contract

indices using the general metric, subject to the xed scalar conditions.

the parity-odd moduli are more interesting. they induce shifts in the u(1)

charges that can be computed using the general rules given in (13-16). after specializ-

ing to the moduli that respect the eective ve-dimensional structure these formulae

show that the background charges and the charged excitations do not mix. the

charged excitations shift via:

the shifts in the background charges are compensated by changes in the xed scalars.

the net result is therefore that the spectrum of the charged excitations is modied

by the parity-odd moduli through the shifts (57-59) of the u(1) charges, but with

the background charges unmodied. this rule provides rather detailed information

about the structure of the spacetime cft.

4.5 general moduli and the charged excitations

the moduli dependence of the excitations can be investigated in more detail using

the setup introduced in section 3.2. the discussion of the background given there is

extended to the excitations by introducing the matrix expressions:

it is convenient to discuss the excitations of the type iib background. begin with

the background consisting of z17, q15, and p5. after m-reduction along r1 and t-

dualization to iib along r3, this becomes the canonical f1/ns5/kk-monopole back-

ground. we denote the circle dual to the m-theory 13 two-torus by rb, so that the
t 4 has cycles b246. then we can relabel the corresponding charge matrices as:

it is straightforward to nd the map of the moduli as well.

as we have seen, the structure of the spectrum of excitations is that of wind-

ing/momentum charges on a triplet of independent t 4s; in addition, there are three

special charges. in the matrices above the zt

2 is, entry by entry, the winding dual to

the momentum excitation ze, for three of the four cycles on the triplet of t 4s; and:

has the remaining three momentum-winding pairs (the pairing is under reection

across the diagonal), as well as the three special charges on the diagonal. the triality

of the three t 4s acts by:

ze  ze

z2  z21

zo  zo1 ,

(67)

where  is a permutation matrix. the fact that this operation permutes the special

charges as well suggests that each of the three special charges should be associated

with a particular t 4.

specializing this expression to rectangular tori and exploiting the xed scalar condi-

tions, we recover appropriate denominators in the mass formula. for generic moduli

there is not a meaningful concept of levels, i.e. integer denominaters in the mass

formula. however, it follows from the discussion in section 3.6 that other special-

izations of the moduli, corresponding to sl(3, zz) transforms of the rectangular tori,

likewise give simple denominators. that this also works out in the present formulae

is a consequence of covariance under duality transformations.

the cross-terms in the mass formula come from 1/4-bps and higher contributions

and are independent of the moduli. they are determined as the expressions involving

charges that transform in compatible ways and reduce appropriately in the special

case of rectangular tori. the result:

we can write, for example:

5 is there an exactly solvable cft in the moduli

space?

in the ads/cft correspondence, it is extremely useful to nd a point in the moduli

space where the cft is amenable to perturbative treatment, or even better, exactly

27

solvable. for instance, invariants on the moduli space, such as the bps spectrum

and its degeneracy, quantum corrections to current algebra anomalies, etc., can be

worked out explicitly. thus one may ask whether the three-charge brane background

we have been discussing admits an exactly solvable cft in the moduli space.

let us recall the structure of the symmetric product orbifold cft that appears in

the moduli space of the two-charge (e.g. d1-d5) brane background, given its remark-

able similarity to the present problem. for t 4, the cft in question is a sigma model
on symn (t 4)  ( t 4  ir  s3), with n = q1q5; it describes a region in the moduli
space that is naturally associated to background brane charges (q1, q5) = (n, 1). the

other factors in the target space represent the zero modes of the diagonal u(1) in the
u(q1) u(q5) gauge theory on the d1- and d5-branes; the ir s3 part, representing
motion transverse to the t 4, decouples and may be ignored in this instance. the
cft moduli space is hn\so(5, 4)/so(5)  so(4), with hn the discrete subgroup
of so(5, 4; zz) that preserves the background charge vector [18, 5]. bps consider-

ations [5] and an analysis of the gravitational eective eld theory [27] show the

existence of a u(1)8
r current algebra; half of these come from the diagonal
of the symmetric orbifold, half from the extra t 4. these currents are a part of the

l  u(1)8

singleton sector of the cft. moduli deformations aect the cft in two ways: first,

they act as deformations of the t 4 components of the symmetric product orbifold

(sixteen of the moduli are the metric and b-eld of the individual t 4s, and four are

zz2 twist operators); roughly speaking, the various twisted sectors realize supergravity
in the bulk of ads3  s3. secondly, the moduli act in the global, singleton sector
via current-current interactions which deform the metric on the u(1)16 charge lattice.

the spectrum of u(1) charged excitations in the symmetric orbifold, as well as other

considerations, is sucient to identify the symmetric orbifold locus in a corner of the

moduli space that corresponds to canonical background charges (n, 1) [5]. deforma-

tions away from this locus are a linear combination of the moduli of the symmetric

product, and the current-current interactions.

the addition of kk monopoles to the background leads to a remarkably parallel

structure to the moduli space, as we have seen. it is therefore tempting to speculate

that there is again an exactly solvable point in the moduli space in the region corre-

sponding to the canonical background charges (n, 1, 1). the near-horizon geometry

28

of one kk monopole is the same as at space; in particular, it does not deform the

angular s3 of the space transverse to the onebrane-vebrane system. this leads one

to suppose that the symmetric orbifold structure survives more or less intact.

the moduli space is now hn\f4(4)/su(2)  usp(6). in addition to the twenty
moduli of the d1-d5 system, there are eight additional moduli; four of these come

from the enlargement of the t-duality group from so(4, 4) to so(5, 4) (mixing the

bered circle of the kk monopole with the four-torus), and four more are rr moduli6.
the spacetime cft has twelve right-moving currents in the (2,6) of su(2)usp(6),
and fourteen left-moving currents in the (1, 14). in the iib description, these currents

naturally fall into three sets of u(1)4

l  u(1)4
currents on the left. one of these sets of u(1)4

r, together with two additional special
l  u(1)4
r corresponds to perturbative
string momentum and winding (36), and is naturally associated with the one-brane

background; another set (37) consists of d1- and d3-branes, and is naturally asso-

ciated with the vebrane background [27, 5] and the third set (38) is associated to

the kk monopole background. we propose to again identify the rst set of currents
with the translation currents on the diagonal t 4 of the symmetric product symn (t 4),

while the other two sets are tentatively identied with two extra four-tori, denoted
t 4 and t 4 (two (4,0) hypermultiplets are the minimal additional eld content needed

to realize these currents).

fivebrane anomalies [36, 37] have terms linear and cubic in the brane charges.

since there is no constant term, the contribution to the anomaly in the su(2) r-
current coming from the extra t 4 t 4 hypermultiplets must be cancelled; the simplest
possibility is to add vectormultiplets, which might be thought of again as representing
zero-modes of the bound state in the ir  s3 throat transverse to the four-torus.

one important problem is to realize the structure of the moduli space in this
framework. the 28 moduli of f4(4)/su(2)  usp(6) transform as a (2, 14) under
su(2)  usp(6). they again appear in two ways: as moduli of the symmetric
product orbifold, and as current-current interactions. the t-duality group so(5, 4)
l 
r translation currents on each individual four-torus with the j3 component of

is manifestly realized in the symmetric orbifold, when we supplement the u(1)4

u(1)4

6when the background charges are entirely ns.

29

the left-moving su(2) r-symmetry 7. the four zz2 twist moduli that preserve the
n = (4, 4) supersymmetry of the symmetric product may be supplemented with four
more such moduli that only preserve n = (4, 0) supersymmetry. these moduli were
identied in [5] by matching quantum numbers in the symmetric orbifold to those

of the supergravity spectrum. one also needs to represent the eect of the moduli

on the charged spectrum of the singleton sector. the marginal deformations of a
set of u(1) currents are always of the form so(p, q)/so(p)  so(q); therefore, the
f4(4)/su(2)usp(6) local geometry of the moduli space must, as far as the singleton
sector is concerned, embed in such a structure. indeed, f4(4) embeds in so(12, 14)
via the 26, while su(2)  usp(6) embeds in so(12) via the (2, 6) and in so(14)
via the (1, 14). note that (2, 6)  (1, 14)  (2, 14); there is a unique projection of
the current bilinears onto the appropriate subspace of so(12, 14).

clearly t 4

diag  t 4  t 4 realizes an so(12, 12) structure; but one must identify
two more left-moving currents to ll out the 14 of usp(6). from (45), one current

is (momentum/winding) of perturbative strings on the kk monopole circle. the

so(5, 4) t-duality group mixes this current with the analogous ones on t 4. under

t-duality, one has the decomposition:

f4(4)  so(5, 4) 
26

9 + 16 + 1

so(5)  so(4)

[(5; 1, 1) + (1; 2, 2)] +

[(4; 1, 2) + (4; 2, 1)] + (1; 1, 1) .

the natural realization of so(5, 4) on the global modes of the candidate cft mixes

the diagonal t 4 translation currents with the overall j 3

l of the symmetric product;
this accounts for the rst line in the last column. the second pair of representations in
brackets consists of the translation currents of t 4 t 4; the remaining singlet must be
made from some left-moving current, since it is the last element of the 14. note that
the t-duality so(5, 4) naturally embeds in the so(8, 8) t-duality group of t 4  t 4
via the spinor representation (i.e. the sixteen translation currents transform as the

vector of so(8, 8) and the spinor of so(5, 4)). this is precisely the way in which d-

brane charges transform under t-duality. the so(5, 4) structure is thus manifestly

realized in the candidate cft.

7indeed, it is precisely this quantum number that is aected by the asymmetric orbifold which

introduces kk monopole charge in pertubative string descriptions [38, 15, 10].

30

modular invariance suggests completion of the signature (12,14) lattice transform-

ing under f4(4), to a (14,14) lattice as explained in section 4.2; the extra charges are

the special bps charge (38), and the su(2)r r-charge. the latter is natural, since
it contains the right-moving partner of j 3

l, the current of translations on the kk
monopole circle. a puzzling feature of the spectrum derived in section 4.2 is the

dierence in left- and right-moving levels, which is an invariant on the moduli space.

the contribution of the charges to this dierence is:

(73)

matching this structure places strong constraints on the spacetime cft, and in par-

ticular the currents that remain to be identied in the proposed candidate  the

current that couples to the special bps charge on the right, and the last member of

the 14 on the left.

in the (4, 4) theory  the d1/d5-system  the bps states of the symmetric product
orbifold match those of the kk towers of the eective 6d supergravity on ads3  s3
[39, 28, 31]. the su(2) r-symmetry current algebra quantum numbers label the
spherical harmonics on s3. the 5d supergravity on ads3  s2 that results when kk
monopoles are added to the background is simply the truncation of this spectrum to

j 3
l=0, in the sector with vanishing momentum along the kk ber circle. deformation
in the moduli space away from the (n, 1, 1) corner will squash the s3, so that

by the time one is in a region with a valid low-energy supergravity interpretation,

the states carrying momentum j 3

l on the monopole circle will be much heavier that
those with j 3
l = 0. note that the squashing of the three-sphere will act as well on
the two vectormultiplets describing the ir  s3 throat transverse to the four-torus
parametrized by the hypermultiplets, suggesting that the last element of the left-

moving 14 should also involve the bosonic su(2) wzw currents.

there are other requirements on the spacetime cft. one can analyze the f1-ns5-

kk monopole background in global coordinates on ads3 [10], using the perturbative
string techniques of [25] 8. at least a subset of the bps spectrum should be realized in
8note that this approach describes the background only on singular loci, and for qk > 1, a rather

31

this framework [18]. in [10], bps states carrying the quantum numbers of perturbative

strings with winding and momentum on the kk monopole circle (parametrized by
x5) were identied; these have dimension hr = jr = j3
level nosc = p5w5, and thus their degeneracy is exponential in p5w5.

r and carry oscillator excitation

thus far, we have not been able to nd a suitable modication of the candidate
symn (t 4) ( t 4  ir s3) ( t 4  ir s3) cft meeting all the above requirements.
the crucial missing ingredient is an identication of the proper linear combination of

the many available currents which realizes the structure of the special charges p5,
w5 and n12345.

comments on k3: finally, we should remark on the dierences between com-

pactication on t 4 and k3. for d1-d5 bound states on k3, there was rather little
dierence; the extra t 4 was simply replaced by an extra factor in the symmetric

product, and the duality group was still sucient to place all brane charges (q1, q5)

with the same product n = q1q5 within the same moduli space. the addition of kk

monopoles to the mix yields a dierence; the duality group is no longer sucient to

map all brane charges to (n, 1, 1)  there is no duality that mixes the kk monopole

charge with the other two, as there is in a t 4 compactication. this is reected in the

presence of a linear term qk(q1q5 + 2) in the anomaly of the r-current. a consequence

is that one expects to have the possibility of an exactly solvable point in the moduli

space only for qk = 1.

the 5d supergravity on ads3  s2  (s1  k3) inherits 22 vectors from tensor
multiplets of iib on k3, two from each of the two gravitino multiplets, and one

additional vector (the graviphoton) from the supergravity multiplet [40]. the moduli
space is locally so(21, 4)/so(21)so(4), with the charges transforming as (1, 21)
(2, 2)  2(1, 1) under so(4)  so(21). the rst two consist of the (4,20) lattice of
d1/d3/d5-branes wrapping the monopole circle and cycles of k3, together with

one linear combination of the special charges; one singlet is the other combination

of special charges coupling to a left-moving current; and the remaining singlet is

the special bps charge dual to the brane background, which couples to a right-

dierent subspace of the moduli space; hence one can only safely compare invariant quantities such

as bps spectra.

32

moving current. adding the r-current, the lattice has signature (6, 22). the four

multiplets of charges each have components in common with the toroidal case; so

global symmetries, and the discussion of the latter case in this paper, combine to

ensure that all the charges are associated to currents.

a derivation of a bps mass formula

the computation in this appendix follows [22]; see also the appendix of [5].

the supersymmetry algebra in m-theory leads to the eigenvalue equation for the

central charges:

2cm n z m n +
the central charges zm n and qm n p qr  1

charges; the pm are the momenta, in particular p0 is the mass m that we want to

(74)

compute. the spinorial eigenvector of the preserved supersymmetry is denoted , and

the metric is mostly plus.

we choose the background as the three m5-branes intersecting over a line, and

want to consider any conguration of u(1) charges. writing out the eigenvalue equa-

tion in terms of individual charges yields an expression that is lengthy and not illu-

minating. motivated by the qualitative considerations in the main text, the charges

can be divided into various groups:

level

z35, z46, z36, z45 p1, p2 q17, q27

z13, z24, z14, z23 p5, p6 q57, q67

q12 + q34 + q56

z12, z34, z56

33

we consider rst the terms that correspond to the third line in the table, that is a

single background m5 and 8 specic u(1) charges. the eigenvalue equation becomes:

3 = q56012347 +h05p5 + 06p6 + 012346q57 + 012345q67i

+h013z13 + 024z24 + 013z14 + 013z23i ,

(75)

which is understood as an operator equation acting on the spinor . the three terms

on the right hand side are mutually anti-commuting, so the square of the equation

becomes:

2
3 = q2

56 +h05p5 + 06p6 + 012346q57 + 012345q67i2
+h013z13 + 024z24 + 013z14 + 013z23i2

= q2

56 + (p5 + q67)2 + (p6 + q57)2

+(z13 + z24)2 + (z14 + z32)2 .

(76)

(77)

in the computation leading to the second expression we took 1234 = 1, thus removing

all operators. we can therefore take an ordinary square root, and then expand the

result according to the hierarchy between the charges. this gives:

3  q56 +

1

2q56 h(p5 + z67)2 + (p6 + z57)2
+ (z13 + z24)2 + (z14 + z32)2i .

(78)

an analogous computation can be carried out for the charges in the rst and second

line of the table, yielding eigenvalues 1 and 2, respectively, after imposing the
conditions 3456 = 1 and 1256 = 12343456 = 1. now note that the terms arising
from any of the rst three lines of the table commute with those coming from the

others, in particular 1234, 3456, and 1256 mutually commute. therefore the involved

matrices are simultaneously diagonalisable or, in other words, the full result is simply

the sum of three terms of the form (78).

at this point we need to include also the three special u(1) charges that appear

in the fourth line of the table. let us consider these together with the background,

without other u(1) charges present. the eigenvalue problem becomes9:

 = q12034567  q34012567 + q56012347 + z12012  z34034 + z56056 .

9the signs of q34 and z34 have been ipped relative to (74) so that the background charges can

(79)

be taken positive. below q37 and q47 will be similarly ipped.

34

the rst three and the last three terms commute between themselves, but these two

groups anticommute with each other. the square therefore gives:

2 = (q12 + q34 + q56)2 + (z12 + z34 + z56)2 ,

(80)

for 1234 = 3456 = 1256 = 1. this is an exact expression for the mass, when only
the background and the three special u(1) charges are turned on. in the scaling limit

it becomes:

  q12 + q34 + q56 +

(z12 + z34 + z56)2
2(q56 + q12 + q34)

.

(81)

the transformations that diagonalize the eigenvalue problems for 1,2,3 commute

with each other, as remarked above, but they do not in general have a simple relation

to the eigenvalue problem for . however, to the order we compute the eigenvectors of

the undisturbed background solve all the eigenvalue problems considered; and this is

sucient to guarantee that the various partial results can be added without inducing

further crossterms. the nal result for the mass is therefore:

m  q12 + q34 + q56

2q12 h(p1 + q27)2 + (p2 + q17)2 + (z35 + z46)2 + (z36 + z54)2i

2q56 h(p5 + q67)2 + (p6 + q57)2 + (z13 + z24)2 + (z14 + z32)2i

+

+

+

+

(z12 + z34 + z56)2
2(q12 + q34 + q56)

.

(82)

this is the formula needed in the main text.

in the considerations relating to black hole entropy we need a couple of rene-

ments. first, it is customary to include the scalar charge, i.e. the momentum p7 along

the r7 direction. the resulting term in the eigenvalue equation commutes with all

the background terms and anticommuetes with all the terms from the u(1) charges.
additionally, the p7 is small in the scaling limit, of order l0

p, so cross-terms between
the scalar charge and the u(1) charges are negligible. these facts are sucient to

ensure that p7 can be included in (82) by simple addition.

next, we want to derive the conformal weight of the left-movers. roughly, this
amounts to the substitution   7, ipping the eigenvalue of the momentum;

35

alternatively one might ip the ve-brane numbers by taking the opposite quantum

numbers for 1234, 3456, and 1256. either way there is a problem, because the

eigenvalues of the -matrices are not independent. the physical origin of the problem

is that the present theory is chiral, with (4, 0) supersymmetry. the conformal weight

of the left-movers is therefore not given by supersymmetry alone. this contrasts with
the treatment of the d1  d5 system in [5], where the (4, 4) supersymmetry was
exploited to deduce both the right-moving and the left-moving weights. in the main

text we nd the left-moving weights using global symmetries.
