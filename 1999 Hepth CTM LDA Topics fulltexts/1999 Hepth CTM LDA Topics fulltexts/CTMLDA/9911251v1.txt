abstract

the non-commutative geometry is revisited from the perspective of a generalized d p-brane.
in particular, we analyze the open bosonic string world-sheet description and show that an
eective non-commutative description on a d p-brane corresponds to a re-normalized world-
volume. the world-volume correlators are analyzed to make a note on the non-commutative
geometry. it is argued that the u (1) gauge symmetry can be viewed in a homomorphic image
space for the non-commutative space of coordinates with an so(p) symmetry. in the large b-
eld limit, the non-commutativity reduces to that among the zero modes and the world-volume
description is precisely in agreement with the holographic principle.

introduction

dirichlet (d) p-branes are non-perturbative [1] topological defects seen in string theory. they

have been studied extensively to explore the non-perturbative domain [2, 3, 4] using mathe-

matical tools familiar in string theory. among various aspects of a generalized d p-brane, the

non-commutative geometry [5, 6] on its world-volume has signicantly played a role to enhance

our understanding of the gauge theory. in a recent analysis [7], a precise relation between the

non-commutative and commutative gauge symmetries on a d p-brane world-volume has been

established.

the idea of non-commutativity is quite natural in the theory of open strings. for in-

stance, its world-sheet boundary is an one-dimensional ordered space which is evident from its

vertex operators insertion. in fact, under a rotation of the world-sheet, the vertex operators

retain the cyclic symmetry and implies a non-commutative geometry there. in the context of

open string eld theory, the non-commutative geometry has also been addressed [8]. since the

dynamical aspect of a d p-brane has its origin in open string physics, interestingly, the longi-

tudinal collective coordinates for a generalized d p-brane also become non-commutative. this

implies that the world-volume geometry can be analyzed perturbatively as a deformation to the

commutative one. the (convergent) series expansion has been shown to be identical with the

moyal product following a boundary conformal eld theory technique [9]. in the recent past,

non-commutative geometry in the realm of a d p-brane have been explored in great details by

various authors [10]-[21]. further investigation in this direction is believed to provide a concep-

tual understanding of the d-brane geometry and may enlighten a formulation for the quantum

gravity.

in this article, we focus on the non-commutative description on a world-volume of a

generalized d p-brane with an emphasis on the zero modes. we consider the re-normalized

world-volume to bring a note on the eective non-commutativity as seen in a physical process,

such as scattering phenomena. we study the world-volume correlators for the renormalized d p-

brane to comment on the non-commutative and commutative symmetries. by diagonalizing the

world-volume into two dimensional block diagonal forms, we discuss the possible geometry on

a rotated d p-brane. finally, the large b limit is analyzed and the holographic correspondence

is argued to relate the non-commutative and commutative geometries. in this limit, the world-

volume becomes non-local due to the zero modes and the landau level for the d-particles can

be seen to be degenerate.

we plan to present the article as follows.

in section 2.1, we briey discuss the d p-

brane dynamics in the open string channel to obtain the boundary conditions. in sec. 2.2, we

present the non-commutative aspect of a d p-brane. the re-normalization of the world-volume

is performed in sec. 2.3. subsequently in sec. 3.1, we obtain the world-volume correlators for a

generalized d p-brane. sec. 3.2, deals with the world-volume rotational symmetry so(p) for a

d p-brane and the role of zero modes are discussed. the large b-eld limit is discussed in sec.

3.3. and we conclude the article with discussions in sec. 4.

2 open string analysis

2.1 generalized d-brane description

let us begin with the open bosonic string dynamics [22, 23] in presence of closed string back-
ground elds: metric g , kalb-ramond (kr) eld b ( = 0, 1, . . . 25) and a constant dilaton.
in a world-sheet conformal gauge, the open string action can be given by

s =

1

4 zh g ax ax   ab b ax bx  i + z 

a x  ,

(1)

where the second integral denotes the u (1) gauge (eld: a) interaction at the boundary, .

now consider an arbitrary d p-brane2 with p-spatial coordinates describing its world-

volume in the open string theory (1). the background elds can be seen to induce metric h

and the antisymmetric b-eld on the world-volume of the d p-brane. in a gauge, h0i = 1 and

b0i = 0 for (i = 1, 2, . . . p), they can be given by

hij = g ix jx 

and bij = b ix jx  ,

(2)

the gauge choice allows an independent treatment of the time component (x 0) from the re-
maining spatial ones. on the boundary, it satises the neumann condition nx 0 = 0, where n
denotes the normal coordinate. the b-eld is a (p  p)-matrix of rank r = p/2 and is magnetic

due to the gauge choice. in fact, the b-eld can not be gauged away in presence of a d p-brane

and the gauge invariance can be maintained in combination with the u (1) gauge eld in the
theory. since a d p-brane is dened with dirichlet boundary conditions, x  = 0, along the

transverse directions ( = (p + 1), . . . 25), the eective dynamics (1) turns out to be the one on

2for deniteness, consider an even p case in type iia string theory. the odd p case can as well be discussed

for the euclidean world-volume geometry where it is even dimensional.

2

its world-volume. then the induce world-volume elds (2) can be identied with the longitudi-
nal components (hij = gij and bij = bij) of the background elds. also, the gauge eld on the
world-volume can be identied with the longitudinal components of the u (1) eld.

the general nature of the world-volume elds is very dicult to treat and one needs to

adopt an approximation. we consider geodesic expansions for the elds (hij, bij and ai) around

their zero modes and they can be given by

1
2

fij x j + o(f ) ,

ai(x) = 
gij(x) = ij +  gij x  + o(2 g)
bij(x) = eij +  bij x  + o(2 b) .

and

(3)

for slowly varying world-volume elds, the derivative corrections (3) can be ignored and the

eective action (1) for the world-volume dynamics (with a diagonal metric) becomes

s 

1

4 (cid:20) z

hijax iax j + (b + 2 f )ijz 

x i x j (cid:21) .

(4)

the eld strength (b + 2f ) is a gauge invariant combination and thus the gauge eld can
be absorbed in the b-eld ( b = 2b). since a d p-brane carries charges (qp) coupled to the
ramond-ramond (rr) forms cp+1, the wess-zumino (wz) action for a generalized d p-brane

can be symbolically given by

sw z = qp z dtdp e

b  c .

(5)

now the neumann boundary conditions for a d p-brane are derived from the eective action

(4). they are modied due to the b-eld and can be expressed as

hij nx j + bij tx j = 0 ,

(6)

where t denotes the tangential coordinate.

2.2 non-commutativity on the world-volume

in this section, we present the canonical analysis to obtain the non-commutativity among the

d p-brane collective coordinates. consider the topology of the world-sheet as i[0,]  r (an
innite strip of width 0    ). then the space-like parameter, , runs along the length of

the string and  can be considered as time-like. the momenta conjugate to the coordinates can

be given by

pi = hij tx j + bij nx j

(7)

3

in presence of b-eld, the momenta (7) receive correction and is known to be responsible for

the non-commutative description on the d p-brane world-volume. the commutation relation

between the conjugate coordinates at the boundary can be derived (6) from that in the bulk

among the canonical variables with an invertible b-eld. in general, the commutators on the

boundary ( = 0 and ) are subtle to dene. in a time ( ) ordered space, the commutators can

be expressed as

and

hx i
l( ) , x j
hx i
r( ) , x j

l( )i = i(cid:16) 2ij
r( )i = i(cid:16) 2ij

s  ij
s + ij

a (cid:17) e(   )
a(cid:17) e(   ) ,

(8)

l = x i(, 0) and x i

where x i
r = x i(, ) are the open string operators dened, respectively,
in the left and right ends of the open string x i(, ) on the d p-brane world-volume. under

the reversal of the prametrization,     , the corresponding non-zero modes in the fourier

expansion for the operators (xl  xr) can be seen to remain invariant. the right hand sides (8)
for the commutators are c-numbers and contain a symmetric (i  j) ij
s and an antisymmetric
a

ij matrix parameters. explicitly, they can be expressed as

ij

s = (cid:18) h

h + b



h

h  b(cid:19)ij

and

ij

a = (cid:18) 1

h + b

b

1

h  b(cid:19)ij

.

(9)

the left and the right ends of the open string are separated by a geodesic of string

length and are out side each other light cone. this in turn implies that no physical eect can

be propagated between the left and right space-like modules (al and ar). the commutators

between them become

hx i
l( ) , x j

r( )i = 0 .

(10)

the expression for the commutators (8) involve a discrete value function e(y) which

takes +1 or 1, respectively for positive and negative y. in a general description, e(y) ensures

the ordering in the phase space. a close observation on the non-commutativity (8) indicates
that the diagonal elements, ij
s , are ordered in time,  , where as the o-diagonal elements ij
a
can be ordered with respect to the space-like coordinates x i( ). to avoid the naive ambiguity
(if any), while dening the commutators (8) at equal time ( =  ), one can alternately dene
the operators, x i( ), with a time ordering,  >  , such that |   | is innitesimally small

. as a result, the non-commutativity in the space-like directions, i 6= j, can be interpreted
intuitively as a time ordered space. then the commutators (8) in the left and right modules3

3henceforth, we drop the index l and r, since the left module is a commutant of the right module and

vice-versa. physics is identical in both the modules except for a signature (8).

can be expressed,

hx i( ) , x j( )i = t hx i( )x j ( 

)  x i( )x j( 

+)i .

(11)

since the world-volume dynamics involves open string modules, it describes a phase space

for a d p-brane. the algebra a of functions (in left and right modules) are generated by the
operators u i = exp(ix i) and satisfy the c  algebra4 with multiplication of functions on the

non-commutative space. it can be given by

u i  u j  u i  u j = ei (2ij

s ij

a)u i  u j .

(12)

2.3 eective non-commutativity: a renormalized d-brane

in this section, we discuss the eective non-commutativity as seen in a physical process such as

in the scattering phenomena. for simplicity, consider the tachyon emission vertices vn(kn, n) =

exp [ikn  x(n] for (n = 1, 2 . . . l) inserted on the boundary. the scattering amplitude can be

obtained by taking the expectation value for the time ordered (1 > 2 > . . . > l) vertices:

l

yn=1

s kinkjn  ij

= exp

vnes ,a

i xn>nh2ij

d
using momentum conservation, pn kn = 0, it can be checked that the symmetric part ij

s in
the phase factor (13) does not contribute substantially. thus the eective non-commutative
parameter is due to the antisymmetric matrix elements ij
a which in turn implies the presence
of b-eld. then the eective phase responsible for the world-volume non-commutativity reduces

akinkjni e(n  n)
d

vnea=0

l

yn=1

.

(13)

to

exp
2i xn>n

ij

akinkjne(n  n)
 .

(14)

this expression implies that the non-commutativity on the world-volume is solely due to the

broken phase of cyclic symmetry in the time ordered space. this in turn implies that the
antisymmetric parameter, ij

a, plays a vital role for the non-commutative description on the

world-volume.

the illustration (14) shows that the world-volume elds should be re-dened to absorb

the symmetric matrix elements, ij
s . in fact, the diagonal matrix elements are associated with
a short distance divergence [24, 25, 17], which can be seen while dening the correlators in

4e.g. u i(x)  u j (x) = exp(iij

a yizj ) u i(x + y)u j (x + z)|y=0=z. the -product is associative and leads

to moyal bracket description.

5

sec. 3.1. the divergence can be regulated by introducing a cut-o. this in turn implies that

the world-volume should be properly re-normalized to absorb the symmetric matrix elements
completely. if x i denote the renormalized coordinates

x i( ) = x i( ) +  x i( ) ,

(15)

then  x i contain the divergence and can be regulated by introducing a cut-o. the coecient

of the divergence piece (15) is symmetric in (i  j) and can be intuitively obtained from ref.[17]

 x  (s + s ) k  [divergence] ,

(16)

where the extrinsic curvature k can be obtained by considering the lie derivative on the induced
elds (h, b). the additional symmetric elements, ij

s , can be expressed as

ij

s  =   b

h + b

b

h  b!ij



.

(17)

as a result (15), the world-volume elds (2) become renormalized i.e. hh and b b.5 then

the commutators (8) in terms of the renormalized coordinates in the time ordered space become

h x i( ) , x j( )i = iij

a e(   ) .

(18)

since the short distance divergence is renormalized, one can also, alternately, re-write the com-
mutators (18) at equal time ( =  ) where ordering is implicit among the space-like coordinates
x i( ). for the renormalized coordinates, the commutators takes the form:

h x i( ) , x j( )i = iij

a .

(19)

on the other hand, the boundary interaction (4) naively seems to be invariant under

an innitesimal u (1) gauge transformation ai = i. however, the gauge eld ai(x) itself

possesses a dependence on the non-commuting coordinates. thus a proper treatment of the

gauge eld is necessary to account for the string coordinates. in fact, such an approximation

(geodesic expansion around its zero modes) has already been taken into account (4) for slowly

varying b-eld. as a result the u (1) gauge sector is constrained by the collective coordinates
ai   1
bij x j. this in turn implies that the gauge transformation can be viewed as a re-
2
parameterization invariance

 ai =

bij  x j + o(b).

(20)

5the detail of the computation for the re-normalization can be obtained from ref.[17]) by a suitable conformal

transformation.

3 geometry and zero modes

3.1 world-volume correlators

now let us study correlation function dened with the operators, x i( ) in the left and right
modules on the d p-brane world-volume. they dene the neumann propagator, gij(,  ) =
hx i( )x j ( )i, on the world-volume which is a (p  p)-matrix valued. the propagators satisfy

the boundary condition (6)

hij ngjk + i bij tgjk = 0 .

(22)

the explicit expression for the propagator gij(,  ) on the world-volume can also be obtained by

a conformal transformation from our earlier work [17]. the boundary value propagator denes

the world-volume correlators and can be given by

gij(,  ) = 2 ij

s ln |   | 

i
2

ij

a e(   ) .

(23)

as discussed in section 2.2, the limit    can be considered with a time ordering  >   and
when |   | is kept innitesimally small. then the propagator in the limit, 0, becomes

gij(,  ) = 2 ij

s ln  

i
2

ij

a .

(24)

it shows that in presence of b-eld,6 a nite contribution is associated with the o-diagonal
matrix elements, ij
a, which is antisymmetric. for  =   in eq.(23), the the symmetric ele-
ments, ij
s , are associated with a logarithmic divergence and the antisymmetric elements are
accompanied with a discrete value function e() which is not well dened there. then, a priori,

the pauli-villars regularization does not seem to be appropriate in presence of b-eld. however
in the limit,    , the propagator (23) is well behaved which essentially denes the point-

splitting regularization. as a result, dierent operators (i 6= j) are not allowed at the same
time ( 6=  ).

it is necessarily due the antisymmetric property of b-eld which denes the

point-splitting scheme.

6if b = 0, the propagators (23) are well dened and can be seen to contain a logarithmic divergence ln . as a
standard practice, the loop divergences contained in hx i( )x i( )i can be regulated by pauli-villars regularization
scheme. in this approach, one renormalizes the world-volume elds (15) at the expense of the vertex operators.
then every element in the propagator precisely corresponds to that of a d-particle.

7

once we obtain the necessary re-normalization for the d p-brane world-volume (16), the

symmetric elements can be gauged away in a physical process (14). then the re-normalized

propagator can be seen to be constant (anti-symmetric) matrix and re-written as

gij(,  ) = 

i
2

ij

a e(   ) ,

(25)

in principle, the renormalized d p-brane dynamics [17] receive -corrections (due to the curva-
tures) associated with the antisymmetric matrix elements ij
a. the higher order terms associated
with  can be argued for the corrections to the commutative geometry. this in turn implies
that the  corrections (accompanied with the antisymmetric property) correspond to the de-

formation of the yang-mills theory on the world-volume and lead to an associative algebra in

the left and right modules. the simple analysis explains two dierent geometrical aspects for a

generalized d p-brane which is in agreement with the recent analysis [7].

3.2 so(p) symmetry: homomorphic image space

in general, a rotation among the spatial coordinates changes the topology leading to equiv-

alent geometries. for instance, under a rotation, a (diagonal) metric and an anti-symmetric

two-form eld can be transformed to anisotropic geometry in presence of a new metric and van-

ishing two-form eld. as a result, the non-commutative geometry can be viewed, alternately,

with a non-local description on the (rotated) d p-brane world-volume. in other words, a re-

normalization, in the context, leads to a world-volume re-denition and can be seen as a rotation

among the (spatial) collective coordinates dening the d p-brane.

in fact the constant matrix coecients in the regulated propagator (25) correspond to

a rotation in the cartan sub-algebra. then the world-volume can be described in terms of p/2

independent blocks. the metric and the b-eld can be expressed as

hij = p/2

r=1(cid:18) hr

0

0

hr(cid:19)

and bij = p/2

r=1(cid:18) 0

br

br

0 (cid:19) .

(26)

now consider the zero modes on the world-volume, xi = x i  i, which can be seen

to play an important role in presence of b-eld. these (constant) modes are characterized by

a group of translations on the world-volume and is responsible for the inhomogeneous space.

on the other hand, the non-zero modes are described by a group of rotation, so(p), for a d

p-brane. under an inhomogeneous transformation

x i  rijxj + xi ,

(27)

8

where rij denotes the rotation matrix [17] and can be written in the (2 2)-block diagonal form:

rij = p/2

r=1(cid:18) r

s + r
s 
2i r
a s

2i r
a
r + r

s (cid:19) .

(28)

it is little tricky to dene the corresponding rotation angles, r, as the metric is not at. finally,

the angle for each (2  2)-block can be written as

r = sin1 (2i r

a) ,

= cos1 (r

s + r

s ) .

(29)

now the world-volume geometry can be analyzed from that of a real plane.7 the new coordi-

nates, x( ) = x + , describe a two dimensional phase space and can be given by

+ = 1 sin  + 2 cos 
 = 1 cos   2 sin  .

(30)

since the rotation angle, , is not xed, it gives rise to a non-local description on the d p-brane

world-volume.

in the new frame, the boundary condition (6) turns out to be

d( ) = 0 ,

where

d = (h n  ib t) .

(31)

the resultant directions () intertwine the neumann and dirichlet conditions [17]. the nature
of the dierential, d, is determined by b-eld.

for a re-normalized d p-brane world-volume, the commutator (19) in the new frame can

be given by

h x r
( ) , x r

+( )i = i r

a .

(32)

since the presence of zero modes make the world-volume an inhomogeneous space, the translation

group does not commute with the rotation so(p). then the commutator (32) can be expressed

in terms of the zero and non-zero modes of the un-twisted world-volume :

h x , x+i = hx1 , x2i +hx1 , 2i +h1 , x2i +h1 , 2i .

(33)

all four of the commutators (33) contribute (independently) towards the non-commutativity on

the world-volume. under a homomorphic transformation, the zero modes can be modded out to

7henceforth, we omit the index r unless it is required.

9

obtain a homogeneous description on a d p-brane. as a result, the homomorphic image space is

commutative among the zero and non-zero modes though the world-volume retains the ordering

(independently) among the zero and non-zero mode sectors. then the commutator (32) can be

given by

the analysis shows that the non-commutative symmetry can be mapped onto a commutative

hx , x+i + h , +i = i a .

(34)

one under a homomorphic transformation. thus the u (1) sector of the world-volume describes

the homomorphic image space for the non-commutative space which is described by the so(p)

rotation group.

in this frame, the constant re-normalized matrix propagator (25) turns out to be diagonal

and satises

d gd(,  ) = 0 .

explicit expression for the propagator can be given by

gd(,  ) = (cid:18) 1

2 a

0

0

2 a(cid:19) e(   ) .

 1

(35)

(36)

the diagonal form of the re-normalized propagator further conrms (following the discussions in
sec.2.3) the commutative aspect of a rotated d p-brane world-volume. in the limit    , the

propagator (36) contributes a nite constant (with antisymmetric property). this in turn, can

be seen to introduce a constant shift on the world-volume elds leading to quantum description

on a d p-brane world-volume.

3.3 strong magnetic eld: zero modes non-commutativity

consider a limiting case for the b-eld, i.e. strong b-eld or large b limit (b >> 1). as discussed

in the current literatures [7, 20, 21], the limit can be seen to shed light on the non-commutative

aspect of a d p-brane as the analysis becomes simpler there. in the limit, the leading term from

the wz-action (5) becomes that for a large density () of d-particles. the leading wz-term in

the limit becomes

sd0

w z  q0  z dt c1 ,

1

2 z dp bp .

where

 =

(37)

this is the idea of branes within higher branes [26]. it can be seen as the building block for the

m-theory description of matrix model [3] as well as type iib matrix theory [4].

10

for large b, (the induced metric |h| << 1), the leading order description on the world-

volume turns out to be topological.

in the limit, the world-volume is in agreement with the

holographic principle. as a result, the closed string dynamics in the bulk can be reproduced

in terms of the open string dynamics at its boundary. this suggests that the world-volume

non-commutative geometry can be considered equivalent to the closed string (commutative)
geometry in the bulk.8 this in turn implies that the non-commutative yang-mills dynamics on

the d p-brane world-volume should be equivalent to the commutative dynamics in the closed

string sector.

in the limit, the boundary conditions (6) becomes

tx i = 0 .

(38)

it shows that the string modes, x i, are identied with the zero modes, xi, in the large b limit.

the expression (38) corresponds to the dirichlet condition for d-particles on a d p-brane world-

volume. this in turn implies that the d p-brane world-volume becomes spatially non-localized

and represents a high density of d-particles. in addition, the world-volume non-commutativity
(8) can be seen only among the zero modes, xi, independently in the left and right modules.

here, the non-commutative parameter ij

a = (1/b)ij and the equal-time commutator
(19) reduces to that among the zero modes of the collective coordinates (x i, ai). it takes the
form:

hxi , xji = i (1/b)ij ,
hxi , aji = 

hij .

i
2

(39)

it shows that the collective coordinates in the gauge sector becomes the canonical momenta to

the conjugate coordinates or vice-versa in presence of a b-eld. in general, non-commutative

description (8) holds good for any value of b-eld though in the limit, a clear picture of d-

particles described by the zero modes emerge out leaving the feebly coupled d p-brane.

in the new frame discussed section 3.2, the picture can be easily identied with the

motion of a large number (37) of d-particles in an uniform and strong magnetic eld (b-eld).

since the d-particles are described only by the zero modes, the wave function representing
its ground state,  = exp (i k x) for the momentum k = 1 bx+, is associated with an
8in fact, the closed string channel is t-dual to the open string channel. in closed string sector, the left and
right modules overlaps due to the periodicity in its boundary value and the non-commutative description (18)
cancels against each other.

11

additional phase due to the non-commutative description, [x, x+] = ib1. it can be given
by

 |(strong b) = e i



b x   |(b=0) .

(40)

since the world-volume is a compact space, the single-value condition on the wave-function can

be imposed by introducing a periodicity in one of the spatial coordinate (x). then its conjugate

momentum becomes (dirac) quantized: k = 2n for an integer n and the phase factor (40)

reduces to: exp(2in x). since the landau levels are independent of the momentum, k, the

d-particle wave function degenerates in presence of a strong magnetic eld leading to a non-

local description. though there are some subtleties due to the boundary value of the coordinate

eld, the illustration shows that the non-commutative description leads to non-localization of

d-particles on the d p-brane world-volume. then the non-commutative yang-mills symmetry

on the world-volume may be better understood from the study of a simple physical model for

the d-particles.

4 discussions

to summarize, we have shown that a re-normalization of the generalized d p-brane is essential

to account for a precise non-commutative geometry on its world-volume. we learned that the

b-eld is essential, due to its antisymmetric property, for the non-commutative aspect of a d

p-brane. due to the subtleties in dening the non-commutativity, we have considered a time

ordering among the operators as an alternative to the non-commutative description. the world-

volume geometry is analyzed with respect to the so(p) rotational symmetry group. the zero

modes were seen to introduce the non-commutative feature between the group of translations and

the rotation. a homomorphic map from the non-commutative space was argued for the abelian

gauge symmetry. large b limit was analyzed and the zero modes non-commutativity on the d

p-brane world-volume were discussed. in the large b limit, the correspondence between the non-

commutative and commutative symmetries can be obtained by implementing the holographic

idea. the existence of such a holographic connection between dierent geometries may enhance

our understanding of quantum gravity.

in the actual computations, though the world-volume elds are slowly varying, the non-
commutative parameter matrix ij
a is assumed to be a constant for simplicity. in principle, ij
a
is not xed. it would imply that the deformation parameter should be expanded (a convergent

series) around its zero mode. however such a generalization is out of reach in the present context.
