a torsion term, can be interpreted as electric-magnetic duality for some of their solitonic
solutions. actually buschers duality transformation interchanges the topological and
noether charges.

1 introduction

the duality symmetry in high energy physics has attracted considerable attention in recent
years. on the one hand t-duality symmetry in string theory and -models inter-relates the
theories with dierent geometries and shows their equivalence which leads to classication
of string solutions and helps to know more about the vacuum states. on the other hand,
the electric-magnetic duality in 4-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories inter-relates the
asymptotic behaviour of strongly coupled electric theories with weakly coupled magnetic the-
ories. indeed this gives a new insight into the long standing quark connement hypothesis,
higgs mechanism and mathematical physics. of course, there are enough works connecting
these two dual symmetries (for a review refer to [1]) such that one can deduce the electric-
magnetic dualiy from t-duality. in all these works the relation between these two symmetries
has been studied by considering the eective action of string theory and the corresponding
equations of motions (the equations of motions follow from vanishing of -model -functions ),
specially for the solitonic solutions (for more details see [2]). therefore, all these investigations
have quantum nature (rst quantization), irrespective of the order of perturbation. hence it
is the main object of this article to investigate this connection classicaly, without using -
functions. we hope that this will help us to understand deeply the relation between these two
dualities. to achieve this goal we investigate the -model with kaluza-klein metric. of course
the motion of string over kaluza-klein space has already been studied [3], using nambu-goto
action for the string. here we consider the -model action and assume that the world surface
has an intrinsic, but not an embeded, metric. this assumption is made for compatibility of
some special solitonic solutions which we are going to study below. comparing the dual model
with the original one, it has been shown that for these special solitonic solutions, t-duality can
be interpreted as the electric-magnetic duality in both models with or without torsion terms.
the structure of the article is as follows. in order the article to be self-contained and also to
introduce the notations, rst we give a brief review of abelian duality in section 2. then in
subsection 3.1 we consider the -model with kaluza-klein metric without torsion term and
its equations of motion. we show that for some special solitonic solutions, these equations
can reduce to geodesic equation of a charged particle. further information about these solu-
tions follow by studying the hamiltonian of the reduced system and also by investigating the
noether and topological currents of this -model. in subsection 3.2 we obtain its dual model
and study further the topological and noether currents of the dual model. it has been shown
that the t-duality is the same as the electric-magnetic duality. in subsection 4.1 we consider
a -model with kaluza-klein metric with torsion term (kalb-ramond term), where we have
used the non-local gauge potential of reference [4]. here also by investigating the equations of
motion and the hamiltonian in the case of some solitonic ansatz, we show that these solutions
can be interpreted as a system describing the motion of dyon in a curved background eld.
the electric and magnetic charges of dyon have been calculated in 4.2. its dual model has
been studied and nally it has been shown that the t-duality interchanges the electric and
magnetic charge of dyon. the paper is ended with a brief conclusion.

2 abelian duality

in this section we briey review the buschers formulation of abelian duality (for more details
see [5,6]). consider the following two dimensional -model over d-dimensional target manifold
m with coordinate {x a}; a = 0, 1, ..., d  1 :

s = 

1

4 z d2[hhgabx ax b + babx ax b],

(1)

where  = ( 0,  1) are coordinates of the world sheet and h is its metric, while gab and
bab are metric and torsion-potential of target manifold m, respectively. the constant  has
dimension of length two. if u(1) isometry exists, then in the adapted coordinate, isometry
appears as the translation symmetry along the isometry coordinate. denoting the isometry
coordinate by y such that x a = {y, x} where  = 1, ..., d  1 , the action (1) takes the
following form:

s = 

1

4 z d2[

hh(g00yy + 2g0yx + gxx)

+ (2b0yx + bxx)].

(2)

in order to obtain the dual model we make this isometry local by gauging it (i.e. replacing the
derivatives of isometry by covariant derivative) so that with the help of lagrange multiplier,
this gauge eld is constrained to at one. then by simply integrating over the gauge eld,
having gauged away the isometry coordinate, we are led to the following dual model:

s = 

1

4 z d2[hh( g00 + 2 g0x + gxx)

+ (2 b0x + bxx)],

(3)

where

g00 = 1/g00

,

g0 = b0/g00

,

g = g 

g0g0  b0b0

g00
g0b0  g0b0

g00

b0 = g0/g00

,

b = b 

.

(4)

from above relations we see that the dual model possesses u(1) isometry too. equations (1)
and (3) have the same physical results, even though the target manifold of given -model and
its dual dier geometrically. notice that these transformations can be obtained throught the
following canonical transformation [6,7]:

py = 1

,

p = 1y.

(5)

from now on we will work in conformal gauge with h00 = 1 and h11 = 1, so that the above
canonical transformation becomes equivalent to the following nonlocal map [6,7]:

y =  b0x + 

( g00 + g0x).

3 -model with kaluza-klein metric (pole solution)

3.1 the model

in this section we consider a -model with metric of target manifold m as kaluza-klein metric
with u(1) isometry. hence for its metric we have [8]:

ds2 = gabdx adx b = gdxdx + r2(dy +

ka
r

dx)2.

(7)

here xa = {y, x}, a = 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 , and  = 0, 1, 2, 3. the metric given by (7) can also be
written as:

(8)

gab =   g + k2aa kra

kra

! .

r2

here we have considered the abelian kaluza-klein theory with a as an electromagnetic gauge
eld, while x and g are the coordinates and metric of four dimensional space-time respec-
tively. the constant k is introduced in order that ka becomes dimensionless. also we have
taken the extra fth dimension as a circle with radius r and an angular variable as its coor-
dinate. in the denition of kaluza-klein metric given in (7) all terms of the ve dimensional
world-line are dimensionally consistent. notice that the gauge eld a and the metric g
are independent of y, hence the fth coordinate is the isometry one. indeed the kaluza-klein
metric (7) is the metric of a u(1) principal bundle. actually, in this section we have taken the
target manifold of the -model as a u(1) principal bundle. according to the formula (1), the
action of this model in a conformal gauge with vanishing torsion can be written as:

its variation leads to the following euler-lagrange equation:

s = 

1

4 z d2gabx ax b.

(gabx b) 

1
2

agbcx bx c = 0.

as gab is independent of the fth coordinate y, therefore a = 5 case leads to:

a = 0,

a = g5bx b.

(9)

(10)

(11)

this is the same as the conservation law due to isometry, and if we use the explicit form of
kaluza-klein metric (8), this relation can be interpreted as a continuity relation. as we will
see below, it can be obtained via noether theorem. using the explicit form of the kaluza-klein
metric (8), the equation of motion (10) for a =  components can be written as:

(gx) 

1
2

gxx =

k
r

afx,

(12)

where f = a  a is the electromagnetic eld intensity. this is the equation of a two
dimensional -model in the presence of an electromagnetic eld. let us consider the following
solitonic solution for the equation (10):

y = m + ,

x = x( ),

(13)

4

with the coordinate  = ( 0,  1) of the world sheet as  = (,), where 0    2;
 appears for dimensional consistency (we are working in natural system of units); m is an
arbitrary integer and  is a constant. this ansatz has also been proposed in reference [9], but
there are some important points which deserve much attention. here we are going to deal with
-model, hence h is an intrinsic metric and it diers drastically from the metric induced
via embedding of two dimensional world sheet into target manifold m. therefore, contrary to
reference [9], there is no contradiction with the choice of h as a conformal metric. now, by
using the ansatz (13) in equations (12) and (11), we get:

a = kra x + r2 = const,

d
d

(g x) 

1
2

g x x =

k
r

a f x.

a =

mr2


(14)

(15)

this is the same as the geodesic equation of a charged point particle in the curved space-
time with metric g, within the presence of an electromagnetic eld a. now, if we assume
that a is the gauge eld of a monopole located at the origin (consistent with the fact that
monopole is a solitonic solution of ve dimensional einstein equation [10]), then equation (15)
can be interpreted as the equation of motion of a point charged particle in a given curved
space-time within the presense of a magnetic monopole. in order to make the subject more
clear, we investigate the hamiltonian of the system. hence we write action (9) in terms of the
space-time metric and gauge eld as:

s = 

1

4 z d2[r2yy + 2krayx + (g + k2aa)xx].

using the ansatz (13), we get the following form for the momentum density:

 =

1

2

[(g + k2aa) x + kra],

5 =

a
2

.

(16)

(17)

also, substituting the ansatz (13) in the action (16) we get the following action of a point
particle by integrating over 1:

s = 

1

2 z d [

m2r2
  r22  2kra x  (g + k2aa) x x].

hence, we have

x = g(p 

kar

a),

where p is the momentum of soliton. finally, for the hamiltonian of the system we get:


2

h =

g(p  qea)(p  qea) + (

m2r2
2

+

q2
2k2 

e

qer

k

),

where qe, the charge of soliton, is dened as:

qe =

kar

.

5

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

it is clear from the formula (20) that the hamiltonian of the system depends on the integer m.
also, from equations (15) and (20) we see that the mass of the soliton is m = 1
 . on the other
hand, this hamiltonain is bounded from below by |qe|, which is one of the characters of the
solitonic solution. moreover, as expected from the kaluza-klein theory, the fth momentum
p5 is proportional to the charge of soliton:

p5 = z 2

0

5d =

a


,

k
r

p5.

qe =

(22)

therefore, charge quantization follows from the quantization of the fth momentum as com-
pactness of the fth coordinate:

p5 =

n
r

,

k
r2 n,

qe =

(23)

where n is an integer number. before proceeding with the investigation of the dual model
we derive the topological and noether currents of the model itself.
in order to obtain the
topological charge we consider the following topological current:

hence, the topological charge is dened as:

j
top =

r2
k

y.

qtop = z 2

0

j 0
topd 1 =

2mr2
k

.

(24)

(25)

this is similar to the magnetic charge of the monopole. to see this, we consider the chern
number of u(1) principal bundle:

g = zc

da st

r2

k z dy = qtop.

(26)

note that in using the stokes theorem we have assumed that a approaches an exact form
in the boundary of region of surface integration. now, using the relations (23) and (25), we
obtain the well-known diracs quantization:

qe.qtop = 2mn.

(27)

in order to obtain noether current we investigate the symmetry of the action (16). we have
already seen that this action has an isometry symmetry, and it is invariant under the trans-
formation y  y +  in the adapted coordinate. therefore, according to noether theorem we
obtain the following conserved current:

j  = 0,

j  =

k
r

[krax + r2y]

(28)

which is the same as relation (11). we can obtain the charge qe by integrating over j 0.

6

3.2 dual model

using the transformation (4) we obtain the dual model.
in writing these transformation
relations one should be careful. for example, the metric gab and torsion potential bab
have chosen to be dimensionless in section two, while some terms in the action (16) have
the dimension of length. hence, we must take into account the coecient 1
 for the sake of
dimensional consistency. also, note that in relation (16) isometry is in the fth dimension,
hence in relation (2) the index 0 plays the role of 5 in relation (16). after taking into account
all these facts, the coecients gab and bab of dual model can be written as:

g55 =


r2 ,

b5 =

k
r

a,

g5 = 0,

g = g/,

b = 0.

(29)

using these data we get the following action for the dual model:

s = 

1

4 z d2[


r2  +

1


gxx + 2 k
r

ax].

(30)

before proceeding to discuss this action and the results which follow from it, it would be
most convenient to compare it with the action (16). indeed the two actions describe the same
physical system but their geometries dier drastically from each other. if we use the method
of path-space used in [11] for describing the dynamics of a system consisting of a charged point
particle and a magnetic monopole, the antisymmetric term in action (30) can be interpreted as
the interaction of a two-dimesional eld with the magnetic monopole. indeed, using the stokes
theorem, this term can be obtained from the following wess-zumino term (in path-space):

k
16r

 zb

fxxd3,

where b is a three dimensional manifold with world surface as its boundary. therefore, the
antisymmetric wess-zumino term in the action (30) can have physical interpretation. let us
see what kind of a system can be described by the action (30), if we use the solitonic solution
which is discussed in the previous section. to make the subject more clear, let us consider the
following ansatz:

 = m + ,

(31)
where, similar to the relation (13), m is an integer and  is a constant. by substituting the
relations (13) and (31) in equation (6) and using the relation (29), we obtain the following
relation between ( m, ) and (m, ) :

x = x( ),

hence,  can be written as:

m =

a

,

 =

r2m


.

 =

r
k

qe +

k

2

qtop.

7

(32)

now we investigate the topological and noether currents. as we have described in the previous
section and as it is clear from the form of the action (30), we see that the action has a u(1)
isometry. hence the action (30) is invariant under the transformation    +  . thus, the
noetherian current follows from this symmetry:

hence, the noetherian charge of solitonic solution (31) is equal to

j =


r2  + 

 k
r

ax.

qn = z 2

0

j0d1 =

k
r2 qtop.

on the other hand, the topological current of the system (30) can be written as:

therefore, for the topological charge we get

j
top =

r

2

.

qtop =

r2
k

qe.

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

comparing the relations (34) and (36) we see that the buschers or dual transformation in-
terchanges the electric and magnetic charges. hence for solitonic solutions of kind (13) or
(31), t-duality transformation interchanges the noether charge following from the equation
of motion with the topological charge associated to the bianchi identity; that is it acts as
electric-magnetic transformation. also, note that from equations (34) and (36) we get:

qn . qtop = qe.qtop

(37)

4 -model with kaluza-klein metric with torsion term

(dyonic solution)

4.1 the model

in this section we consider again the -model with kaluza-klein metric with an extra anti-
symmetric term of the form:

s = 

1

4 z d2[r2yy + 2krayx + (g + k2aa)xx

(38)
where a and a are non-local gauge potentials [4]. as a result, the electromagnetic intensity
eld and its dual can be written in terms of these potentials:

+ 2kr ayx],

f = a  a,
f =  a   a,

8

(39)

where f = 1
2f . it has already been shown in reference [4] that the non-locality of
potentials a, a aects neither the equation of motion nor f and its dual f. in the action
(38), the metric g and potentials a, a are assumed to be independent of y. of course, this
assumption is compatible with the non-locality of potentials. similar to the previous section,
y is the coordinate of isometry. in general, variation of the action (1) leads to the following
equations of motion:

[(gab + bab)x b] 

1
2

a(gbc + bbc)x bx c = 0.

(40)

again, since gab and bab of the action (38) are independent from the coordinate y, we get
the following equation for a = 5:

d = 0,

d = r2y + krax + kr ax,

(41)

whereas the a =  component of equation (40) takes the form:

(gx) 

1
2

gxx =

+

k
r
k2
2

dfx + kr fyx

(a f + 2 af)xx.

now, similar to the previous section, we consider the following solitonic ansatz:

y = m,

x = x( ).

in this case, the equation of motion reduces to:

and

d = kra x = const,

d
d

(g x) 

1
2

g x x = (

kd
r

f +

mkr


f) x,

(42)

(43)

(44)

which can be interpreted as equation of motion of dyon in a space-time with metric g in the
presence of electromagnetic eld f. similar to the previous section, to see how the solitonic
solution can appear as dyon, we consider the hamiltonian of the system:


2

h =

a) +
where the electric and magnetic charges of dyon are dened as:

a)(p  qea  qm

g(p  qea  qm


2k2 (qe

2 + qm

2),

(45)

qe =

kdr

,

qm =

krm



.

(46)

it is clear from the equation of motion (44) that the dyon has the mass m = 1
 . it is also
obvious from the hamiltonian (45) that the solitonic solution saturates the bogomolnyi limit:

we can dene the fth momentum using the relation (38) and analogous to the previous section,
we can obtain a relation between fth momentum and electric charge of dyon. now we proceed
to investigate the solitonic solution in dual model and give its physical interpretation.

2 + qm

(47)

4.2 dual model

in order to obtain the dual model we use again the buschers transformation (4); the coecients
of the metric and the torsion terms are chosen to be dimensionally consistent. hence, we have:

g55 =


r2 ,

g5 =

k
r

a,

g = (g + k2 a a)/,

b = 
therefore, the action of the dual model can be written as:

b5 =

k
ra,

k2


(a a  a a).

(48)

(49)

s = 

1

4 z d2[


r2  +

2k
r

ax +
k2


ax 

+

2k
r

1


(g + k2 a a)xx

(a a  a a)xx].

the equation of motion is same as (40) provided that we replace the isometry coordinate y,
the metric gab and torsion bab by the dual isometry coordinate , dual metric gab and dual
torsion bab, respectively. thus, for the following solitonic solution similar to (43):

 = m,

x = x( ),

(50)

where m is an integer, the equations of motion become:

d =

k
r

a x = const,

d
d

(g x) 

1
2

g x x = (kr d f +

mk

r

f) x.

(51)

these equations indicate that even the solitonic solution of the dual model has a dyonic
behaviour. to nd the exact value of the electric and magnetic charge, and in order to further
investigate the behaviour of solitons, we consider the hamiltonian of the system:


2

h =

a) +
with the electric charge qe and the magnetic charge qm of dyon as:

a)(p  qea  qm

g(p  qea  qm


2k2 ( q2

e + q2

m ),

qe =

k m
r

,

qm =

kr d

.

(52)

(53)

again, from the dual hamiltonian (52), it is clear that the solitonic solution (50) saturates
bogomolnyi limit:

e  q q2

e + q2
m .

10

(54)

now in order to get the relation between the model and its dual, we compare the equations (44)
and (45) with their duals (51) and (52). we see that duality transformation (48) is equivalent
with the following one:

a  a,

r 


r

or consequently:

m  m,

qe  qm ,

qm  qe .

(55)

(56)

now, using the relation (6) for the solitonic solutions (50) and (43), we get the following
relations between the charges:

qm = qm ,

qe = qe .

(57)

hence, duality transformation is the same as qe  qm , that is the electric-magnetic duality
transformation.

5 conclusion

we saw that the torsionless -model with kaluza-klein metric for some special solitonic ansatz
reduced to a system which described the motion of a charged particle in a given curved back-
ground manifold, where for a strong coupling (t = 1
 .
also, by investigating its dual model we have shown that usual abelian dual transformation
interchanges the noether charge obtained from the equation of motion with topological charge
associated to the bianchi identity. we also obtained these results for the -model with torsion
term using the non-local gauge potential. again it has been shown that for some solitonic
ansatz this model reduced to a system describing the motion of a dyon in a given curved
background manifold, where similary for the mass of dyon we have m = 1
 . finally, we saw
that the abelian duality leads to the interchange of electric and magnetic charge of dyon. in
other words, for this special ansatz, t-duality can be interpreted as electric-magnetic duality.
