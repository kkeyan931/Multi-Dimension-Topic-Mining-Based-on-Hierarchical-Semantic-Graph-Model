abstract

we show that there exists a consistent truncation of 11 dimensional
supergravity to the massless elds of 7 dimensional gauged supergrav-
ity. we nd the complete expressions for the nonlinear embedding of
the 7 dimensional elds into the 11 dimensional elds, and check them
by reproducing the d=7 susy transformation laws from the d=11 laws.
in particular we determine explicitly the matrix u which connects the
killing spinors to the gravitinos in the kk ansatz, and the dependence of
the 4-index eld strength on the scalars. this is the rst time a complete
nonlinear kk reduction on a nontrivial compact space has been explic-
itly given. we need a rst order formulation for the 3 index tensor eld
a in d=11 to reproduce the 7 dimensional result. the concept of
self-duality in odd dimensions is thus shown to originate from rst order
formalism in higher dimensions. for the ads-cft correspondence, our
results imply that one can use 7d gauged supergravity (without further
massive modes) to compute certain correlators in the d=6 (0,2) cft at
leading order in n. this eliminates an ambiguity in the formulation of
the correspondence.

the question whether in general a consistent kaluza-klein (kk) truncation exists
at the nonlinear level is an old but still unresolved problem (except for tori).
in
supergravity (sugra), the truncation of d=11 sugra on ads4  s7 to maximal d =
4 gauged sugra was intensively studied 15 years ago [1], culminating in a series of
papers by de wit and nicolai [2] who proposed nonlinear ansatze and checked their
validity in many sectors. the interest in those days was to nd realistic 4 dimensional
models from spontaneous compactication of maximal 11 dimensional sugra. recent
developments in the ads-cft correspondence [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] have renewed interest
in ads compactications to 5 and 7 dimensions. a crucial question is whether the

ads5s5 and ads7s4 compactications allow consistent truncations to the massless
sector, because if there does not exist a consistent truncation, massive elds have to
be considered for computations of correlators in the corresponding cft [5].

in this article we analyze the kk reduction of d=11 sugra on ads7  s4. this will
allow us to go further than the work on ads4  s7. in ref.
[2] d=11 sugra was rst
reformulated in a form with a local-tangent space su(8) instead of the usual so(1,10),
and then the consistency of the kk truncation on ads4  s7 was studied as far as
the bosonic and fermionic transformation rules are concerned. in our case, we choose
not to go through the intermediate step of nding a formulation of 11d sugra with a
corresponding local so(5) invariance, hence we will directly work with the d=11 sugra
as it is usually formulated.

one of the reasons to study the ads7  s4 case is that we would like to understand
the origin of the mysterious self-duality in odd dimensions [8] which appears in various
supergravities in odd dimensions. to obtain the action for selfdual tensors one begins
with the antisymmetric tensor from d=11 whose action is quadratic in derivatives,
and introduces an extra auxiliary antisymmetric tensor eld in the lower dimension by
hand, rotates both tensors, factorizes the second order eld equations into two eld
equations linear in derivatives, and drops one of the factors. the end product is an
action of the form f a + a2 [8] which is dual to chern-simons theory for the abelian
case [9] but not for the nonabelian case [10]. in sugra the nonabelian version appears.
in this letter we present our main results leaving the details of the calculations for a
future publication [11].

maximal (n=4) sugra in 7 dimensions has a 3 index tensor s,a (a=1,5) with
a self-dual action. because in the linearized kk reduction one needs to introduce an
auxiliary eld b  b to construct this action [12], we will start from a rst
order formulation for a in d=11, and deduce self-duality. the 11 dimensional
lagrangian we start from and its supersymmetry transformations rules are given in
the table i, where , , ... = 0, 10 are curved vector indices and m,n,...=0,10 are at
vector indices. the action is invariant under the susy laws for any value of the real
constants a and b. we will x them later by the requirement of consistent truncation.

the action in table i contains a new rst-order formulation as far as the 3-index
tensor eld a is concerned. there exists also a rst order formulation of d=11
sugra with an independent spin connection  [14]. initially we tried to deduce the d=7
selfduality from this eld , but this did not work [11]. instead we will work with a
second order formalism for the spin connection.

at this point we have come in 7 dimensions as far as others in 4 dimensions. how-
ever, we have been able to nd the solution for u. first of all, we have been able to
show that (11) follows from (13), so that (13) is the crucial equation. the solution of
(13) reads

next we turn to the ansatz for f. at the linearized level it contains the
uctuations in g and g , and uctuations in a [12]. at the nonlinear level,
an ansatz for f containing only the uctuations in g and yielding the correct
chern-simons actions in d=7 was given in [17, 18]. we now present the complete
expression for f; it contains the results of [12] and [17, 18], and satises the
bianchi identities.

the action of 1/ x in (15) and (16) is understood as follows: expand t /(y  t  y ) in
spherical harmonics and then act with 1/ x on each term; here t = tabab.
to combine the linearized ansatz of [12] with the form for f obtained in [17, 18]
we have added 2 independent closed forms (i.e., expressions satisfying the bianchi
identities). we note that these are the only two modications to the ansatz for f in
[17, 18] which do not change the chern-simons terms for bab
 . any other modication
will generate mixed terms of the chern-simons type, involving both bab
and the
scalars or the antisymmetric tensor, terms which are not present in the 7d action.



the precise expression of the 4-form added in the f sector is highly constrained.
it must reproduce the linearized term in [12], and it must yield the correct scalar
potential in d=7 after integrating over the compact space. in order to perform this
integral to which both the einstein action and the kinetic action of the 3-index photon
contribute, we start with the metric in the internal space and its inverse:

where c a
mations of the background metric as describing an ellipsoid with the conformal factor
4/5, whose axes at a specic point y in the d=7 space time are determined by the
eigenvalues of t 1
ab. when setting the gauge elds to zero and disregarding the terms
with d=7 space time derivatives, the integral over the compact space of the einstein
action is already of the desired form, namely a linear combination of t 2 and t r(t 2).
on the other hand, the integrated kinetic action of the 3 index photon has the form

4 qdet g (x)(yeyf t ef )2(1 + s), where (3/2)qdet g (x)s is the extra

r d4x9
term we need to add in f besides its background value. this function should be of
degree zero in t ; it depends only on the scalar uctuations in (1)a
i, and, moreover,
the d=7 scalar potential restricts its expression to t /(y t y )5. the proportionality
constant is xed by the requirement that in the limit of small uctuations s is equal
to h
. one obtains then (15). the nal check on (15) is that we recover upon
integration the d=7 scalar potential.

the ansatz for the independent uctuations a and the auxiliary eld e1/2b

is found by matching the last term in  in (ii.6) (the term with s,a):

at this moment all the ansatze are xed, and we can verify the remaining terms in
the 7d susy transformation rules (ii.4,ii.6,ii.7). this provides a number of independent
nontrivial checks on all our ansatze. the calculations involved in these checks will be
publised elsewhere [11]. they involve heavy use of the formalism of spherical harmonics
[19].

finally, let us comment on applications to the ads-cft correspondence. the fact
that there exists a consistent truncation means that we can use the 7 dimensional
gauged sugra action for calculations of correlators of the operators in the 6d (0,2) cft
which correspond to the gauged supergravity elds, at leading order in n. indeed,
consistency of the truncation means that there are no linear couplings of massive
elds to the gauged sugra, and so in the tree diagrams of gauged sugra the massive
elds will not appear. in [20], a computation of correlators of chiral primary operators
in the cft was performed, following the work for the ads5  s5 case in [21] (for
other calculations of 3- and 4-point functions see [6, 7]) . to nd the correct cft
behaviour, a nonlinear redenition of the scalar elds was also needed, which did
result in a consistent truncation of the scalar modes to the massless ones. the nonlinear
redenition in d = 7 is equivalent to our nonlinear embedding in d = 11 for the massless
modes, but note that the results of [20] are only up to quadratic order (and only for the
scalars) whereas we do nd a fully consistent truncation to all massless modes. with
our results one can extend the calculations of cft correlators to the other massless
(sugra) bosonic sectors and to the fermionic sector.

we expect that we can also nd a consistent truncation in the ads5  s5 case, in
which the same comments apply to the correspondence between ads5  s5 and n=4
d=4 sym. (again, a consistent truncation of the scalar modes to the massless ones
was implicitly obtained in [21], by imposing the correct cft behaviour). perhaps our
methods can also be used to complete the explicit expression for the truncation on
ads4  s7.
