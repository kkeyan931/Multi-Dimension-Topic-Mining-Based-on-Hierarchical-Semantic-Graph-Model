spectrum of su (2) yang-mills quantum mechanics
with high precision is given and applied to obtain the
energies of the groundstate and the rst few excited
states.

the so-called yang-mills mechanics originates
from yang-mills eld theory under the supposi-
tion of the spatial homogeneity of the gauge elds.
since its introduction twenty years ago [1] this
model has been studied extensively from dierent
points of view [2] - [15]. the model is known to ex-
hibit stochastical behaviour at the classical level.
in particular it has been shown for a simplied two-
dimensional version of the model that it is nonin-
tegrable [3]. how this reects itself on the corre-
sponding quantum mechanical problem is still un-
der investigation [4] - [6] , [11], [12]. furthermore it
oers the possibility to develop methods generaliz-
able to the study of the corresponding non-abelian
gauge eld theory. with this point of view yang-
mills quantum mechanics has been investigated in
the small volume approximation [5], in the small
coupling limit on the lattice using the semiclassi-
cal approximation [9], and to estimate the glueball
spectrum [14]. furthermore the question of the ex-
istence of normalizable zero-energy wave functions
in supersymmetric matrix models [16] as general-
izations of yang-mills mechanics is under intensive
investigation (see e.g. [17] and references therein).
in the present work we would like to investigate
the groundstate and the rst few excited states of
su (2) yang-mills quantum mechanics using the
variational approach. the quantum treatment of
such models is confronted with the diculties due
to the existence of the non-abelian gauss law con-
straints and the presence of the unphysical degrees

of freedom. in [13] it has been shown that classical
su (2) yang-mills mechanics, after the elimination
of all unphysical degrees of freedom, reduces to the
equivalent unconstrained system described by the
hamiltonian

this hamiltonian is dened on the phase space
spanned by the three canonical pairs xi, pi and
the three so(3) left-invariant killing vectors i
satisfying the poisson bracket relations {i, j} =
ijkk . each of the three conguration space
variables xi is dened on the positive half line. the
hamiltonian (1) has been obtained by writing the
spatially homogeneous su (2) gauge elds aa
i (t) in
the so-called polar representation [18]

aai (q, q) = oak (q) qki ,

with the orthogonal 3  3 matrix o parametrized
by the three angles q and the positive denite 3 3
symmetric matrix q. the three angles q are pure
gauge degress of freedom, which do not enter the
hamiltonian while their conjugated momenta are
vanishing according to the gauss law constraints.
the variables xi appearing in the hamiltonian (1)
are the eigenvalues of the positive denite symmet-
ric matrix q

q = rt ()d(x1, x2, x3)r() .

the angles  in the orthogonal matrix r() and
their canonical momenta are combined in the
killing vectors k . we emphasize that by de-
nition of the polar decomposition the diagonal el-
ements xi are positive denite which has impor-
tant consequences on the quantum level, as will be
shown below.

the transition to the corresponding quantum
hamiltonian is free of operator ordering ambigu-
ities. the operators ji = rijj corresponding to
the right-invariant so(3) killing vectors commute
with the hamilton operator.
its eigenstates can
therefore be classied according to the quantum
numbers j and m as eigenvalues of the total spin
~j 2 and its projection j3. we shall consider here
only the spin zero sector, ~j 2 = ~2 = 0, for which
the schrodinger eigenvalue problem reduces to

for the hermiticity of the hamiltonian h0 dened
in (2) the wave functions have to satisfy the bound-

the potential in (2) has three at valleys of zero
energy, x1 = x2 = 0 and x3 arbitrary, and the two
others obtained from this by cyclic permutation.
close to the bottom of the valleys the potential is
that of a harmonic oscillator with a width narrow-
ing down for larger values of x3.

one of the main results known for such a prob-
lem is that it has been proven to have a discrete
spectrum due to quantum uctuations [4] [5], al-
though the classical problem allows for scattering
trajectories. based on the well-known operator in-
equality 1

nonseparable solutions which have an energy below
(6).

to obtain an upper bound e for the groundstate
energy e0 of the hamiltonian the most powerful
tool is the rayleigh-ritz variational technique [21],
based on the minimization of energy functional

e[] := (cid:10)|h0|(cid:11)
(cid:10)|(cid:11)

.

(7)

guided by the harmonic oscillator form of the val-
leys of the potential in (2) close to there bottom
a simple rst choice for a trial function compat-
ible with the boundary conditions (3) and (4) is
to use the lowest state of three harmonic quantum
oscilators on the positive half line

it follows that

h  .

(5)

since the hamiltonian h 
is known [4] to have
a discret spectrum, this is true also for h0. an
important open question is at which energy the
groundstate is. the well-known nonnormalizable
zero energy solution e=0 := a exp[gx1x2x3]
[19], [20], does not satisfy the necessary bound-
ary condition (3). the knowledge of the ground-
state energy of h  in inequality (5) would provide
a lower bound for the groundstate energy of h0.
due to the additive structure of the potential term
in h  one can make a separable ansatz for the solu-
tion of the corresponding eigenvalue problem. the
energy of the lowest such separable h  eigenstate
satisfying the above boundary conditions (3) and
(4) is

sep = 6|0|(3g/2)2/3 = 9.1924 g2/3 ,
e 

(6)

where 0 = 2.3381 is the rst zero of the airy
function. we shall see in this letter that there exist

lead to the isotropic optimal choice

 := 1 = 2 = 3 = 31/3g2/3 .

(9)

as a rst upper bound for the groundstate energy
of the hamiltonian we therefore nd

e0  e[000] =

31/3g2/3 = 4.8676 g2/3.

this upper bound is in agreement with the lower
bound of the energy functional for separable func-
tions

(10)

obtained from the operator inequality (5) and the
lower bound (6) for separable solutions of h .

in order to improve the upper bound for the
groundstate energy of the hamiltonian h0 we ex-
tend the space of trial functions (8) and consider
the fock space of the orthonormal set of the prod-
ucts

with the frequency xed by (9). furthermore the
variational procedure becomes much more eec-
tive, if the space of trial functions is decomposed
into the irreducible representations of the residual
discrete symmetries of the hamiltonian (2). it is
invariant under arbitrary permutations of any two
of the variables pijxi = xj pij , pij pi = pjpij and
under time reections t xi = xit, t pi = pit ,

[h0, pij ] = 0,

[h0, t ] = 0 .

we shall represent these by the permutation oper-
ator p12, the cyclic permutation operator p123 and
the time reection operator t , whose action on the
states is

p123(x1, x2, x3) = (x2, x3, x1) ,
p12(x1, x2, x3) = (x2, x1, x3) ,
t (x1, x2, x3) = (x1, x2, x3) ,

and decompose the fock space spanned by the
functions (11) into the irreducible representations
of the permutation group s3 and time reection t .
for given (n1, n2, n3) we dene

we therefore have the following irreducible repre-
sentations. the singlet states (0)+, the axial
singlet states (0), the doublets ((+1)+; (1)+)
and the axial doublets ((+1); (1)). since
the partner states of the doublets transform into
each other under the symmetry operations p12 or
t , the corresponding values of the energy func-
tional are equal.

due to this decomposition of the fock space
into the irreducible sectors, the variational ap-
proach allows us to give upper bounds for states
in each sector. the values of the energy functional
for the states in each irreducible sector with the

doublet states.

in order to improve the upper bounds for each
irreducible sector, we truncate the fock space at
a certain number of knots of the wave functions
and search for the corresponding states in the
truncated space with the lowest value of the en-
ergy functional. we achieve this by diagonalizing
the corresponding truncated hamiltonian htrunk
to nd its eigenvalues and eigenstates. due to the
orthogonality of the truncated space to the remain-
ing part of fock space the value of the energy func-
tional (7) for the eigenvectors of htrunk coincides
with the htrunk eigenvalues.

including all states in the singlet sector with up
to 5 knots we nd rapid convergence to the follow-
ing energy expectation values for the three lowest
states s1, s2, s3

e[s1] = 4.8067 g2/3 (4.8070 g2/3),
e[s2] = 8.2515 g2/3 (8.2639 g2/3),
e[s3] = 9.5735 g2/3 (9.6298 g2/3),

(13)

where the number in brackets show the corre-
sponding result for 4 knots. the lowest state s1 is
very close to the state (0)+

s1 = 0.994562 (0)+
000 + 0.0252533 (0)+
0.0216617 (0)+

have been obtained. including all states in the ax-
ial singlet sector with up to 8(7) knots we nd the
following energy expectation values for the three
lowest states a1, a2, a3

e[a1] = 13.2235 g2/3 (13.2275 g2/3),
e[a2] = 16.6652 g2/3 (16.7333 g2/3),
e[a3] = 19.1470 g2/3 (19.3028 g2/3).

(16)

finally taking into account all states in the axial
doublet sector with up to 8(7) knots we nd the
following energy expectation values for the three
lowest states c(1)

] = 19.9019 g2/3 (19.9914 g2/3),

(17)

we therefore obtain rather good estimates for the
energies of the lowest states in the spin-0 sector.
extending to higher and higher numbers of knots
in each sector we should be able to obtain the low
energy spectrum in the spin-zero sector to high
numerical accuracy.

in summary comparing our results for the rst
few states in all sectors, we nd that the low-
est state appears in the singlet sector with en-
ergy 4.8067 g2/3 with expected accuracy up to
three digits after the dot. for comparison we re-
mark that due to our boundary condition (3) all
our spin-0 states correspond to the 0 sector in
the work of [10] where a dierent gauge invariant
representation of yang-mills mechanics has been
used. their state of lowest energy in this sector
is 9.52 g2/3. furthermore in [14], using an anal-
ogy of su (n ) yang-mills quntum mechanics in the
large n limit to membrane theory, obtain the en-
ergy values 6.4690 g2/3 and 19.8253 g2/3 for the
groundstate and the rst excited state.

finally we remark that an analogous calcula-
tion shows that also the groundstate energy of the
hamiltonian h  in eq. (5) is lower than the value
e 

sep of (6) for the lowest separable solution.
