abstract

we obtain a generally covariant conservation law of energy momen-

tum for gravitational anyons by the general displacement transform.

the energy- momentum currents have also superpotentials and are

therefore identically conserved. it is shown that for desers solu-

tion and clements solution, the energy vanishes. the reasonable-

ness of the denition of energy-momentum may be conrmed by

the solution for pure einstein gravity which is a limit of vanishing

chern-simons coupling of gravitational anyons.

i.introduction

2

gravity in 1+2 dimensional spacetime has been a popular subject of discussion from a decade

ago[1]-[6]. though some of the models are toy models, the studies may shed light on the un-

derstanding of not only quasi-(1+2) dimensional physics (e.g. qhe and high tc), but also the

realistic 1+3 dimensional gravity. in any gauge theory in odd dimensions, there exists a special

term, i.e. the chern-simons term, which can be incorporated into the model lagrangian. the

concept of gravitational anyons is a simple non-abelian generalization of the u(1) chern-simons

theory to non-compact gauge group[1][2]. using his sloution to the linearized eld equations,

deser studied the mass and spin of the gravitational anyons[4]. the conclusion states that the

gravitational and inertial quantities are not equal to each other in general and thus the equiv-

alence principle is violated. hence, there exist much dierence between gravitational anyons

and 1+3 einstein gravity.

it seems to us that in order to understand the dierence, we should have a well-dened

denition of gravitational conservative quantities, or in other words, we should have generally

covariant conservation laws. in our previous work[7], we have obtained a generally covariant

conservation law of angular-momentum for gravitational anyons. as suggested in[7], the present

paper is to study the generally covariant conservation law of energy-momentum in the approach

proposed in[8]. the paper is arranged as follows. in section ii, we give a general description

of the scheme for establishing generally covariant conservation laws in general relativity.

in

section iii, we use the general displacement transform and the scheme to obtain a generally

covariant conservation law of energy-momentum.

in this section, we will use a rst order

lagrangian instead of the original one which is in second order. in section iv, we calculate

the total energy-momentum for desers, cleements solutions, and a solution in the vanishing

chern-simons coupling limit. the last section is devoted to some remarks and discussions.

ii. general scheme for conservation laws in general rel-
ativity

as in 1+3 einstein gravity, conservation laws are also the consequence of the invariance of the

action corresponding to some transforms. in order to study the covariant energy-momentum

of more complicated systems, it is benifecial to discuss conservation laws by noether theorem

in general. suppose that the spacetime is of dimension d = 1 + d and the lagrangian is in the

rst order formalism, i.e.

where a denotes the generic elds. if the action is invariant under the innitesimal transforms

i = zg l(a, a)ddx

(1)

x = x + x

a(x) = a(x) + a(x)

(it is not required that a

|g = 0), then following relation holds[8]- [10].

where

(lx +

l
a

0a) + [l]a0a = 0

[l]a =

l
a  

l
a

and 0a is the lie variation of a

0a = a(x)  a(x) = a(x)  ax

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

if l is the total lagrangian of the system, the eld equations of a is just [l]a = 0. hence

from eq.(3), we can obtain the conservation equation corresponding to transform eq.(2)

(lx +

l
a

0a) = 0

(6)

it is important to recognize that if l is not the total lagrangian , e.g. the gravitational part
lg, then so long as the action of lg remains invariant under transform eq.(2), eq.(3) is still
valid yet eq.(6) is no longer admissible because of [lg]a 6= 0.

suppose that a denotes the riemann tensors a

 and riemann scalars a (for gravitational

energy-momentum, anyons

4

, the lagrangian multiplier a

 and the

, so(1,2) connection a

anyons, they are dreibein ea
matter eld a). eq.(3) reads (suppose that lg does not contain a)
 = 0

0a

0a

(lgx +

lg

 ) + [lg]a



under transforms eq.(2), the lie variations are

0a

 = x

,a

  a

,x

where the dot , denotes partial derivative. so eq.(7) reads

[lgx 

lg
a


(x

,a

 + a

,x)]  [lg]a



(x

,a

 + a

,x) = 0

comparing the coecients of x, x

, and x

,, we may obtain an identity

([lg]a



a
 ) = [lg]a



a
,

then eq.(9) can be written as

[lgx 

lg
a


(x

,a

 + a

,x)  [lg]a



a
 x] = 0

or

[(lg
 
by denition, we introduce

lg

a

,] = 0

i 
 = (lg

 

a
,  [lg]a



a
 )

lg
a

lg

,

z

then eq.(12) gives

( i 

 x + z 

 x

,) = 0

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

so by comparing the coecients of x, x

, and x

,, we have the following from eq.(15)

 i 

 = 0

 =  z 
i 



 =  z 
z 



(16)

(17)

eq.(16)-(17) are fundamental to the establishing of conservation law of energy-momentum.

iii. conservation law of energy-momentum for gravita-
tional anyons

3.1. general displacement transform

in 1+3 einstein gravity, a generally covariant conservation law of energy-momentum was

obtained by means of whant we usually call the general displacement transform[8]

x = e

a a

(a = const.)

it really represents an innitesiaml displacement while

x = b = const.

(18)

(19)

does not because x can be any coordinates. for instance, it can be spherical coordinates,

in which case, the resulting conservation law, if exists, should be that of angular-momentum

other than energy-momentum. using the invariance of the action with respect to eq.(18) and

einstein equations , the following general covariant conservation law of energy-momentum is

obtained

(t 

a + t

a) = 0

and it was shown that there exist superpotentials v

a + t

a = v

(20)

(21)

(22)

this denition of energy-momentum has the following main propertities:

1). it is a covariant denition with respect to general coordinate transforms. but the energy-

momentum tensor is not covariant under local lorentz transforms, this is reasonable because

of the equivalence principle.

2). for closed system, the total energy-momentum does not depend on the choice of riemann

coordinates and transforms in the covariant way

p 

a = la

bpb

(23)

energy-momentum, anyons

under local lorentz transform a

b which is constant la

b at spatial innity.

3). for a closed system with static mass center, the total energy-momentum is pa = (m c, 0, 0, 0).

4). for a rather concentrated matter system, the gravitational energy radiation is[11]

e
t



=

g
45c5 (


d)2

5). for bondis plane wave, the energy current is[11]

t
0 = (

1
4

2,

1
4

2, 0, 0)

(24)

(25)

6). for the solution of gravitational solitons, we can obtain nite energy while the landau-

lifshitz denition leads to innite energy [12].

7). in ashtekars complex formalism of general relativity, the energy-momentum and angular-

momentum constitute a 3-poincare algebra and the energy coincides with the adm energy[10].

with these foundations, we next use 1+2 dimensional transform eq.(18) to obtain conservative

energy-momentum for gravitational anyons.

3.2 the energy-momentum for gravitational anyons

we take the lagrangian for gravitational anyons to be in the rst order (a

using eq.(30), eq.(31) can be rewritten as

these equations are the same as those given in[13].

the pure einstein case is restored by setting    and lm = 0. in this limit, we have

thus the iso(1, 2) algebra can be restored.

which is the same as in[16].

v. discussions

as an end, we make some discussions. first, general covariance is a fundamental demand

for conservation laws in general relativity. our denition eq.(39) (40) of energy-momentum

is coordinate independent. as the denition of angular-momentum[7], under local so(1,2)
transform ea  a
worth while noting that for desers solution, the source stress-energy tensor of which is given

b = const., we have p a  la

bp b. second, it is

b(x)eb, where a

b| = la

energy-momentum, anyons

11

a priori(the energy-momentum vanishes while desers gravitational mass vanishes only when

m +  = 0). this is quite dierent from the solution eq.(57) in the limit   . the reason
is that, though the form of eq.(51) agrees with eq.(57), the fall-o is substantially dierent.

remember that in desers solution, the metric is linearized g =  + h, which is a good

approximation on condition that | h | 1. yet in desers solution, hij = ij and   ln r,
so h does not satisfy the contion. we expect a solution with the same t  as desers while

without the diculty.
