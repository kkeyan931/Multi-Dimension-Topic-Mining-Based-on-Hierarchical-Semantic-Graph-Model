abstract

we investigate the stability of the hidden sector gaugino condensate in
a sl(2,z)-invariant supergravity model inspired by the e8e8 heterotic
string, using the eective chiral supereld formalism. we calculate the
planck-suppressed corrections to the truncated approximation for the
condensate value and the scalar potential. a transition to a phase with
zero condensate occurs near special points in moduli space and at large
compactication radius. we discuss the implications for the t-modulus
dependence of supersymmetry-breaking.

dynamical supersymmetry-breaking via gaugino condensation [1] in a hidden sec-
tor is a major component of realistic supergravity unied theories. in heterotic
string theory with gauge group e8e8, the second e8 factor provides a suitable
hidden sector [2] with one or more conning gauge groups (depending on the de-
tails of symmetry-breaking). assuming weak coupling at unication, the gauge
coupling will become strong at an energy scale1   e1/2bg2
x , where gx is the
unied gauge coupling and b is the one-loop beta function coecient dened so
that (g) = bg3 + . . . . the vacuum expectation value of the gaugino bilinear
htri switches on with a value of the order of 3, breaking local supersymme-
try. supersymmetry-breaking is mediated by the dilaton and moduli superelds
s, ti
in the four-dimensional supergravity eective theory: the auxiliary elds
f s and f ti take values of the order of hi, the at scalar potential for s and
ti is lifted and supersymmetry is broken softly in the visible sector [3, 4].
it has has usually been assumed that the condensate is well described by the
globally supersymmetric gauge theory, since the connement scale is well below
mp . in the limit of global supersymmetry mp  , the condensate does not
break supersymmetry [5, 6]: its value is determined in the eective superpotential
approach [5], where the gaugino bilinear is the lowest component of the composite
chiral supereld u = trw w, by setting the auxiliary eld fu = ( wnp/ u )
to zero, where wnp is the nonperturbative superpotential generated by the gauge

dynamics. the connection with supergravity models is via the value of the gauge
coupling at unication, which is determined by the vacuum expectation values of
the dilaton and moduli. the same condensate value follows from minimising the
scalar potential in supergravity if higher-order terms in u are neglected [7, 8]:
we call this the truncated approximation. the resulting condensate value is
substituted back into the nonperturbative superpotential, which is then a function
of the dilaton and moduli only and serves as an eective source of supersymmetry-
breaking [7, 9, 10].

if the supergravity corrections to the truncated approximation are signicant,
there will be eects on supersymmetry-breaking, the stabilization of the dilaton
and moduli, and inationary models which use gaugino condensation to provide a
positive potential [11, 12]. the size of deviations from the truncated approxima-
tion can be found by minimising the supergravity scalar potential as a function
of u. lalak et al. [13] used a similar approach to take into account the backreac-
tion of other elds on the condensate. our analysis diers from theirs, since we
assume a dierent mechanism for stabilizing the dilaton, we set all superpotential
terms which do not depend on the condensate to zero, and we will be interested
mainly in the eects on the compactication moduli of string theory, rather than
the dilaton.

the vacuum expectation value (vev) of the gaugino bilinear is determined
by the scalar component of u at the stationary point of the eective action
(u, s, ti) as dened by burgess et al. [14], where u is treated as a classical eld
which represents the expectation value of the composite operator tr(w w ). in
the simplest case of a single conning gauge group with no matter, the condensate
is formally described by the eld u  u /s3
0, where u = htrw wi and w  is
the gauge eld strength chiral supereld. s0, the chiral compensator supereld,
is introduced to simplify the formulation of supergravity coupled to matter [15]
in the superconformal tensor calculus2. the gaugino bilinear htri is then
the lowest component of u ( =  = 0).
the eective action (u, s, ti) is constructed as a supergravity action, with
a superpotential and kahler potential for the condensate which can be found
by considering the symmetries of the underlying theory and the corresponding
anomalies [5, 14]. in the case of a single overall modulus, t1 = t2 = t3  t , the
superpotential is

wnp(u, s, t ) =

(1)

where fgk(s, t ) is the gauge kinetic function, equal to s at tree level, which
depends on the modulus t through string loop threshold corrections [16], and c
is a constant which will be discussed shortly. the superpotential can be written
as

wnp(u, s, t ) =

where (s)  e3s/2b and h(t ) is a function with appropriate transformation prop-
erties under the target-space duality group sl(2,z) [17, 18]. the condensation
scale c is dened by (3) as

c = es/2b1/3(ch(t ))1/3.

changing the constant c is equivalent to changing the unied gauge coupling
or the beta-function; the value of c could be determined, if fgk is known, by
comparing the resulting condensation scale with the vev of tr(w w) derived
from instanton calculations in global susy [19](compare [17]).

the kahler potential was determined in [14] as

is the perturbative string tree-level kahler potential, and  is an real constant
of order 1; we will show that the value of  does not aect our results. the
expression (5) also holds at one loop if the green-schwarz anomaly cancellation
coecients gs are neglected: we set gs = 0 for simplicity. the expression (5)
can be generalised to include stringy nonperturbative eects [20] which have been
invoked in order to stabilise the dilaton [21]: we replace (5) by

k = p (y)  3 ln(t + t ).

where p (y) is a real function of y  (s + s). the dilaton dynamics enter only
through the auxiliary eld f s, so we do not need to specify the form of p (y);
however, we require p (y) > 0 for the kinetic term for the dilaton to have the
right sign.

note that k becomes ill-dened for (9/)e k/3(u u )1/3  1.

it is not sur-
prising that the eective action for u breaks down in this limit, since it means
that the condensate forms at the string scale and the gauge group is strongly-
coupled at unication. this limitation has implications for the behaviour of the
condensate at large re(t ), which will be discussed later.

the supergravity action is invariant under target-space sl(2,z) transforma-
tions [22, 23] if the superpotential transforms as a modular form3 of weight 3.
the modulus t transforms as

t 

at  ib
ict + d

where a, b, c, d are integers satisfying ad  bc = 1. then u must transform as

u  u (ict + d)3u,

(6)

(7)

where u is a (eld-independent) phase factor; also, the function h(t ) transforms
as h(t )   1
u (ict + d)3h(t ). the u-dependent part of the kahler potential is

then modular invariant. in order to avoid singularities inside the fundamental
domain of sl(2,z), h(t ) must be of the form

h(t ) = 6(t )/h

(8)

where (t ) is the dedekind eta function and h is a constant or a modular
invariant function of t without singularities [10].

the part of (u, s, t ) relevant to nding the value of the condensate is the

scalar potential, which is given as usual by

v = eg(gi(g1)i

where i and j range over the scalar components of u, s and t , gi  g/i,

and we have absorbed a factor of (9/)3/2 into the constant c. the only depen-
dence on  of the potential (9) is in the overall scale, which has no eect on the
existence or stability of minima, so we set 9/ = 1 from now on.

note that the potential depends on the phase of z only through the rst term
if we hold |z| xed and vary the phase, a minimum can
inside the brackets.
only occur when the argument of the logarithm (c(s)h(t )e k/3z3) is real and
positive. the condensate phase arg(z) is then aligned with arg(h(t )1/3) [17],
assuming that c and (s) are real. the dependence of the potential on |z| is then
determined by two real parameters, |c(s)h(t )|e k/2 and c2.
the truncated approximation follows from minimising (9) in the rigid super-
symmetry limit where mp  , (s)  , z  0 and c2 is held constant. the
rst term inside the bracket completely dominates the dependence on z and there
is a zero-value minimum with unbroken supersymmetry satisfying w/u = 0

|ztr| = 103.

returning to local supersymmetry, when c2|z|2 is non-zero, z = ztr is not
a minimum of the scalar potential and we cannot invoke the condition that the
hidden sector gauge dynamics preserve supersymmetry. for small c2|z|2, the
truncated value is a good approximation; however, we would like to nd the
size of corrections, and to investigate the behaviour of the potential when the
truncated approximation fails.

figure 1 shows the eect on the potential as a function on |z| of varying c2
while keeping |ztr| xed. for 3 < c2 < 0 there is an absolute minimum with |z|
near the truncated value and negative vacuum energy. for c2 small and positive
there is a local minimum at |z| near |ztr| and the vacuum energy is positive; as
c2 increases the minimum becomes shallower and moves towards smaller values
of |z|; nally the minimum merges with a point of inection and the condensate
value goes discontinuously to zero, as in a rst-order phase transition4.
the stationary point condition for the potential (9) is a transcendental equa-
tion in z, so we use a series expansion for z near the truncated value and also
search for stationary points numerically. to model the behaviour of the potential
we write it as

we also found the condensate value |z|min at the minimum of the full potential
(13) numerically, as a function of x. for all values of |ztr| < 2  102, the phase
transition at which |z|min goes to zero occurs for x between 1.968 and 1.972.
for larger |ztr|, the transition occurs at slightly smaller values of x, indicating a
dependence on higher-order terms in |ztr|: for example, at ztr = 0.2 the transition
occurs for 1.872 < x < 1.876. figure 2 shows the value of |z|/|ztr| at the minimum
for the full potential and for the series expansion (14), as a function of x. we
take |ztr| = 103; however, the results are very similar for all values of |ztr| below
about 0.3. both curves deviate signicantly from 1, and the series expansion is a
good approximation to the true minimum for x < 0.7. while the series expansion
gives a qualitative picture of the behaviour of |z| near the phase transition, the
value of x where the transition occurs is about twice that predicted by (16). this
is not surprising, since z is large here and the series expansion is less accurate.
figure 3 shows the value of the potential at its minimum and at the truncated
value of z, and the minimum value of the series expansion, as a function of x.
again, there is a signicant deviation from the truncated result for x > few0.1.

series expansion, respectively.

we now discuss in what physical situations the corrections to the truncated
approximation may be signicant. in order to generate phenomenologially rea-
sonable supersymmetry breaking in the visible sector, we require the gravitino
mass m3/2 to be at the tev scale (see for example [3]); for a single condensate it
is given by m3/2  b
6|z|3, which implies a vev of |z|0 = few 105 for the physical
values taken by the dilaton and moduli today. the parameter x = c2|ztr|2 should
be at least o(0.1) for corrections to the truncated approximation to be appre-
ciable, so unless one of the terms in c2 is of order 109 or larger the truncated
approximation is not in any danger today.

the rst term in (10) can become large only if the ratio p (y)2/p (y) does
(note that  / is a constant of order 10). it is unlikely that the function p (y),
which describes stringy non-perturbative eects on the dilaton, will give rise to
singularities or very large numbers; also, since p (y) must be positive, p  cannot
be very small without ne-tuning. the only limit in which the dilaton-dependence
causes the truncated approximation to break down is at strong coupling (s  0),
where the eective action (u, s, ti) is anyway not valid.
the second term involving h(t )/h(t ), where h(t ) is given by (8), may be-
come large if h(t ) is zero or singular for any value of t in the fundamental do-
main; in addition, the eta function decays exponentially with t at re(t )  ,
which leads to a divergence at large re(t )5. nothing can be said within the

5this behaviour can be understood in terms of string states charged under the gauge group
which become light (mass  mp ) at certain values of t [10]. at large re(t ) the extra
dimensions decompactify and an innite number of kaluza-klein states become light, producing
a linear divergence in the gauge kinetic function. at poles or zeros of h a nite number of
states become light, leading to a logarithmic divergence in fgk.

figure 3: vtr and vmin are the value of the potential at |ztr| and at |z|min, respec-

(|ztr| = 103).

eective theory about the limit of large re(t ) or the singularities of h(t ), since
the condensation scale c diverges at these points. however, at zeros of h(t ),
fgk becomes large and positive and the condensation scale goes to zero, so the
eective action can be used to describe the condensate at these points.

consider the ansatz for the t -dependence of the superpotential (2,8) involving

the absolute modular invariant j(t ) [10], where h(t ) takes the form

h(t ) = (j  1)m/2j n/3p(j)

(18)

where m, n are positive integers or zero and p(j) is a polynomial in j. this form
for h has no singularity in the fundamental domain, but may have zeros at the
xed point values t =  = ei/6 and t = 1, since j  (t  )3 near t =  and
j  (t  1)2 near t = 1.
as t approaches a zero of h(t ) (we consider t =  for deniteness), |ztr|
vanishes with |t  |n/3 and c2 diverges with |t  |2. the potential in the
truncated approximation vtr = (b/6)2|ztr|6c2 varies smoothly as t  ; in the
case n = 1, the potential tends to a non-zero value, even though the condensate
vanishes at t =  and supersymmetry is unbroken. this puzzle is resolved by
looking at the stabilization of the condensate explicitly: as t  , the parameter
x diverges as x  |t  |2n/32, so for 1  n < 3 the truncated approximation
breaks down and |z|min goes to zero abruptly at some nite, small value of |t |.
the scalar potential as a function of t develops a hole around t = , inside
which the condensate and scalar potential vanish and supersymmetry is restored.
if t were to fall into such a region, since z = 0 is always a stationary point of the
eective action, a non-zero condensate would not immediately be restored if t

8

then rolled out to a value where (16) held: the universe would have to tunnel
back to a supersymmetry-breaking vacuum.

we also consider varying t away from its present-day value in a perturbative
heterotic string vacuum with s  2 and t0 = o(1), to nd the eect of our treat-
ment of the condensate on the (cosmological) evolution of the moduli if re(t )
becomes large. as was argued above, the present-day value of the condensate
should be |z|0  2  105 in planck units. in the case where h(t ) = 6(t ), ztr
varies as 2(t ): for re(t ) > 3 this is well approximated by 2(t ) = et /6,
while the relevant part of c2 is given by c2  2(t + t )/12  1.64 re(t ). the
eective theory breaks down when |ztr| approaches 1, which occurs when t  21;
however, a non-zero condensate is only stable for 1.64 t et /3(2  105)2 < 1 (see
eqn. 16), which implies that t < 1719 (depending on the exact values of |ztr|0
and (t0)). at the phase transition where the condensate collapses, c2  30 so
|ztr|  0.18, which is consistent with using the eective action.
this analysis can also be applied to models of cosmological ination which use
the t modulus to provide a positive vacuum energy [11, 12]. in the region of the
complex t plane where ination occurs, v  |ztr|6c2 should be of order 10104
to produce the correct amplitude of cmb uctuations at large angular scales [12].
typically, this can be achieved for t = o(1) and c2 = o(10), implying that |ztr|
is of order 102 and x  103: the condensate scale here is much larger than
that required to give realistic susy-breaking. repeating the previous analysis,
we nd that the eective theory becomes invalid at re(t )  9 and a non-zero
condensate ceases to be stable for re(t ) between 6.5 and 7.
one might hope to nd a form of t -dependent superpotential (8) involving
j(t ) (18) which allows t to take large values while keeping modular invariance
of the eective action, since it has been suggested that a realistic vacuum of the
strongly-coupled heterotic string [26] may have re(t ) of order 25 [27]. unfortu-
nately the rst term in the large t expansion of j(t ) increases as e2t , so the
exponential growth of ztr  h 1/32 at large re(t ) is likely to be faster than for
constant h, and there is little prospect of stabilizing either the condensate or t
with this ansatz.

in conclusion, we studied the stability of a non-zero gaugino condensate in an
eective supergravity model motivated from compactications of heterotic string
theory with duality group sl(2,z). we dened a parameter x which determines
the deviation of the value of the condensate from its value in global supersym-
metry. using a series expansion for the eective potential, the corrections to the
truncated approximation at small x were obtained to second order in (c/mp )2
for the value of the condensate, and to rst order in (c/mp )2 for the vacuum
energy as a function of the dilaton and t modulus. numerical minimisation of
the eective potential conrms the series expansion results at small x, and reveals
a phase transition at large x where the condensate vanishes discontinuously. this
appears to be caused by the backreaction of the dilaton and t modulus on the
hidden sector gauge dynamics. there are implications for the t -dependence of
hidden sector supersymmetry-breaking : the auxiliary eld f t and the scalar
potential receive large corrections or go to zero abruptly near special points in
moduli space and at large re(t ). in particular, t is not stabilized against arbi-
trarily large uctuations.

9

it would be interesting to nd the eect of non-zero green-schwarz anomaly
cancellation coecients on the s- and t - dependence of the scalar potential,
and also to analyse the stability of the condensate in the linear supermultiplet
formalism [28]. if the potential for t is very at near the minimum, it may be
worth investigating the eect of including planck-suppressed corrections on the
t -dependent yukawa couplings and soft supersymmetry-breaking terms, partic-
ularly if cp-violating phases depend strongly on the vev of t [29].
