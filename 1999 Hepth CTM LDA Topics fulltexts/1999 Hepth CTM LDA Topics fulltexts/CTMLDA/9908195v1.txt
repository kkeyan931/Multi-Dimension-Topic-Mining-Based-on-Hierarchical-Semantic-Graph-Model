abstract. in these notes, the transverse () lattice approach is presented as a means
to control the k+  0 divergences in light-front qcd. technical diculties of both the
canonical compact formulation as well as the non-compact formulation of the  lattice
motivate the color-dielectric formulation, where the link elds are linearized.

introduction

the main subject of these notes are diculties associated with the formulation
of gauge eld theories on a transverse () lattice using light-front (lf) quantiza-
tion. because of these diculties, the reader may wonder about the advantages of
this approach  particularly given the successes of euclidean lattice gauge theory
(lgt). the primary motivations for formulating qcd in this framework is that
lf quantization is the most physical approach towards a microscopic description of
the parton distributions measured in deep-inelastic scattering as well as many other
hard processes. 1 it is important to emphasize this fact in this brief introduction
since it explains why lf quantization of qcd and the  lattice should be inves-
tigated as a possible alternative to euclidean and hamiltonian lgt formulations
 despite the diculties that will be discussed in the remainder of these notes.

why lf gauge?

although the choice of quantization hyperplane and the choice of gauge are in
principle independent issues, the so-called lf gauge (a+ = 0) turns out to be
highly preferable for the canonical formulation of lfqcd. the main reason is that

~a = (+  iga+) ~a (  iga) ~a,

the term multiplying the time derivative of ~a (i.e. +
therefore, the canonical momenta

~a) contains also a = a+.

(i.e.
avoid having to deal with a system that has to satisfy nonlinear constraints 2 one
normally selects a+ = 0 gauge before quantizing in lf coordinates.

however, this choice of gauge is not entirely free of problems. to illustrate this

fact, let us start from the euler-lagrange equation for a in qed 3

(the lf analog to the poisson equation), which is also a constraint equation. it
is convenient to eliminate a, using the solution to eq.(3), i.e. a(x, ~x) =

the origin of this problem lies in the fact that setting a+ = 0 does not completely
x the gauge freedom. an x independent gauge transformation a  uau 
guu , with u = u(~x),leaves a+ = 0 unchanged and eq. (5) is just the gau
law constraint associated with this residual gauge symmetry4. as long as ~x is

states ( number of ~x!), which is again dicult to deal with. this is one of the
motivations for discretizing the  space direction in the context of lf quantization.

the transverse lattice

the basic idea behind the  lattice [2] is to work in two continuous (x0 and x3 or
x+ and x) space time directions and two discrete [~x  (x1, x2)] space directions,
i.e. space-time consists of a 2-dimensional array of 2-dimensional sheets. 5 the
motivation for working with such a hybrid formulation is that the discretized 
directions provide a the possibility to introduce a gauge invariant cuto, while the

2) eq. (2) is a constraint equation since it involves no time-derivative.
3) since the problem that we are going to discuss occurs already in qed, we will discuss it there
because of the simpler algebra.
4) fixing the remaining gauge freedom requires dealing with explicit zero-mode degrees of freedom
and it is still not completely understood how to do this!
5) in the closely related hamiltonian lgt space-time consists of a 3-dim. array of 1-dim. lines.

continuous longitudinal directions allow to maintain manifest longitudinal boost
invariance (which is one of the advantages of the lf formulation).

the natural way to introduce gauge elds within this framework seems to be to
work with compact link-elds u  su(nc) in the discretized  directions (as is
done in conventional lgt) and with non-compact gauge elds a in the continuous
longitudinal directions. it should be emphasized that both the us as well as the
a (which are dened on the links and sites of the  lattice respectively), are
functions of two discrete and two continuous variables, i.e. one can think of the 
lattice action as consisting of many 1+1 dim. gauge theories coupled together.
the trouble with this formulation is the nonlinear u  su(nc) constraint on
the link elds. the reason that this constraint is more dicult to handle on the
 lattice than in euclidean or hamiltonian lgt is due to the fact that the us
are still two dimensional elds (and not just variables, as in euclidean lgt, or
quantum mechanical rotors, as in hamiltonian lgt). despite several attempts in
this direction [3], nobody has been able to construct a fock space basis out of these
nonlinear  model degrees of freedom which still allows one to evaluate matrix
elements of the lf hamiltonian.

two possibilities to avoid the problems associated with the su(n)-constraint
have been pursued: the rst is to work with non-compact gauge elds also in
the  direction and the other is to keep compact elds, but to relax the su(n)
constraint and linearize the degrees of freedom.

non-compact formulation of the  lattice

again, we illustrate the main diculties in the context of qed. in order to satisfy

the u(1) constraint, one starts with the ansatz u = exp (iea), yielding
j+(y, ~n) + p plaq,

presence of soliton-like gauge elds with a(x = +)  a(x = ) = ke,
where k is an integer! the physics behind this result becomes clear by noting
that exp (iea) acts like such a soliton operator: from the canonical commutation

(9)

therefore the gau law constraint is satised if transversely separated charges
are separated by a string of exponentials  just as one would have expected from
gauge invariance  and the good news is that the infrared divergences cancel if
states are constructed in a gauge invariant way.

it is instructive to examine in detail how the k+  0 divergences cancel in
qed2+1. in 2+1 dimensions, there is only one  direction and therefore purely 
plaquette terms are absent. as a result, the whole dynamics of a is described by
its coupling to a and pure gauge, coupled to external sources, becomes exactly
solvable in the non-compact formulation.

the rest frame energy of an external source j+ in qed2+1 on a  lattice is given

by hrf = v+p  + hrecoil, where v+ is the velocity of the source and

at rst this result (i.e. perfect cancellation of the ir singularity in perturbation
theory) seems to contradict the general discussion of the non-compact formulation

6) this is not surprising since qed2+1 connes.

of gauge theories above, where it is shown that transversely separated charges need
to be connected by a gauge string in order to cancel the ir divergences.

however, this apparent contradiction is resolved by the simple observation the 
lattice hamiltonian for non-compact qed2+1 coupled to external sources is, tech-
nically speaking, just a bunch of coupled shifted harmonic oscillators (the hamilto-
nian is gaussian!). this has two important consequences: first of all, for a shifted
harmonic oscillators, the exact ground state energy is obtained already in 2nd order
perturbation theory. therefore, the calculated ground state energy (18) is the exact
one. secondly, in the language of fock space operators, the eigenstate of a shifted
harmonic oscillator are coherent states, i.e. exponentials of raising operators.

keeping these facts in mind, everything ts together: the coherent states, which
are the eigenstates of the the  lattice in the presence of the external source,
accomplish the same eect as the exponentials of link elds, namely the act as
soliton like operators which are necessary to cancel the small q+ divergence of
the instantaneous self-interaction. furthermore, the fact that we are dealing only
with shifted harmonic oscillators in qed2+1 also guarantees that we observed this
cancellation already in perturbation theory  even though we did not construct
these coherent states explicitly.

however, the bad news is that it is dicult to construct a fock space basis
7 furthermore, when one cannot
containing exponentials of the gauge elds.
solve the problem exactly, it is very dicult to achieve this cancellation of ir
singularities  unless one works with a basis of gauge invariant states, which
is very hard in the non-compact formulation. as usual, in qcd, the situation
is worse because the gauge elds themselves carry color-charge. furthermore, if
one tries to maintain gauge invariance then the ansatz u = exp (iga) leads to
g2  exp(iga) exp(iga) = aa + higher orders and these higher
order terms make it again very dicult to quantize the theory. for these reasons,
the non-compact formulation of the  lattice has been abandoned.

color-dielectric formulation of the  lattice

naively, one might think that one possibility to introduce u  su(n) elds
would be to work with linearized general complex matrix elds and to add a po-
tential vef f (u) that has a minimum for u  su(n) (e.g. mexican hat type
potential). however, in the fock expansion (an essential ingredient in the lf
hamiltonian formulation), the elds are usually expanded around the origin (or
some other xed value). expanding around the origin makes no sense for a mex-
ican hat shaped potential since the origin corresponds to the false vacuum. on
the other hand, expanding around any point along the minimum breaks the mani-
fest global gauge symmetry. therefore, this idea of adding a (lagrange multiplier)
eective self interaction to enforce the constraint must be abandoned as well.

7) even in qed2+1, the exact solution contains exponentials of a and thus leads to non-
normalizable states.

a solution out of this dilemma is to work with blocked (smeared, averaged)
degrees of freedom m, which are obtained from the original u  su(n) by
averaging us or strings of us over some nite volume, e.g. by dening m =
pav u [5]. the advantage of this procedure is that the smeared ms are no longer
subject to the strict su(n) constraint.
for the ms contains an eective interaction dened by integrating out the us

the blocked theory is still equivalent to the original theory, provided the action

(20)

exp [vef f (m)] = z du m xav

u! exp [scanonical(u)] .

the catch in the whole procedure is that vef f (m) as dened through eq. (20) can
be innitely complicated and for its exact determination one would have to perform
a path integral. however, for approximate calculations, one can always make an
ansatz for vef f (m) and there exist various options to determine the parameters
appearing in this ansatz. note that a direct use of eq. (20) to calculate vef f (m)
within the lf framework does not seem to be possible: in order to evaluate the r.h.s.
of eq. (20) one needs to work with link-elds u  su(n) and the diculties in
doing this were the main motivation to introduce the color-dielectric formulation in
the rst place. in the euclidean, calculating vef f seems to be more straightforward,
but for using it on the  lattice, the issue arises of translating vef f from the
euclidean to the lf. 8 an alternative procedure, based on covariance requirements,
appears to be very promising. due to lack of space, the reader is referred to refs.
[7,5], where the procedure has been discussed in detail.
