abstract

the free energy of a multi-component scalar eld theory is considered as a functional w [g, j] of the free
correlation function g and an external current j. it obeys non-linear functional dierential equations
which are turned into recursion relations for the connected greens functions in a loop expansion. these
relations amount to a simple proof that w [g, j] generates only connected graphs and can be used to nd
all such graphs with their combinatoric weights.
a legendre transformation with respect to the external current converts the functional dierential equa-
tions for the free energy into those for the eective energy [g, ], which is considered as a functional
of the free correlation function g and the eld expectation . these equations are turned into recursion
relations for the one-particle irreducible greens functions. these relations amount to a simple proof that
[g, j] generates only one-particle irreducible graphs and can be used to nd all such graphs with their
combinatoric weights.
the techniques used also allow for a systematic investigation into resummations of classes of graphs. ex-
amples are given for resumming one-loop and multi-loop tadpoles, both through all orders of perturbation
theory.
since the functional dierential equations derived are non-perturbative, they constitute also a convenient
starting point for other expansions than those in numbers of loops or powers of coupling constants.
we work with general interactions through four powers in the eld.

i. introduction

the free energy of a statistical or quantum eld theory may be viewed as a functional of the free correlation
functions. it obeys functional dierential equations which may be converted into recursion relations for the connected
vacuum graphs of the theory. subsequently, functional derivatives of w with respect to the free propagators or
their inverses can be taken to generate the feynman diagrams of all connected greens functions. this program was
developed a long time ago by kleinert [1,2], but used only recently for a systematic generation of all feynman diagrams
of a multi-component 4- and 2a-theory [3], and of qed [4]. for 4 theory, only the symmetric case was treated.
however, both in statistical physics and particle theory, this symmetry is often broken. for this reason we generalize
the symmetric treatment of [3], and allow for interactions of all powers of the eld through four. we introduce an
external source j to be able to generate also greens functions with odd numbers of external legs as derivatives of w .
in contrast to [3], this also enables us to generate connected feynman diagrams for the n-point functions through l
loops without having to generate any diagrams with more than l loops rst. as a byproduct, we get an alternative
proof to the one found in [1,2] that w generates only connected greens functions.

we then legendre transform the functional dierential equations for w [g, j] into ones for the eective energy (or
eective action in quantum theory) [g, ] and derive from these recursion relations for the one-particle irreducible

1

(1pi) feynman diagrams representing the proper vertices of the theory. no graphs beyond l loops have to be
considered to generate proper n-point vertices through l loops. as a byproduct, we get an alternative proof that
[g, ] generates only 1pi greens functions, similar to the one found in [1,2].

by using g as a functional argument, and, to the extent possible, derivatives with respect to g instead of j or ,
we keep the identities for w and  and the recursion relations for the connected and 1pi greens functions simple. in
contrast to [3], we do not use the technique of cutting free correlation functions, but always amputate them. as
in [3], the graphical operations necessary to solve the recursion relations can be implemented on a computer for an
ecient generation of higher order graphs.

formally, we consider all our calculations for a statistical theory in d euclidean dimensions, but with trivial changes
of factors i, all results are valid as well for a quantum eld theory in minkowski space and for quantum mechanics.
in this work, where we often deal with more than one interaction term, our ordering principle is always the number
of loops and not powers of coupling constants.

the structure of the paper is as follows:
in section ii we repeat the steps that led to a functional identity for w [g] and a recursion relation for its perturbative
coecients in [13]. this gives us the opportunity to specify our slightly dierent conventions. going beyond the
considerations in [3], we treat part of the quadratic term as a perturbation. this can be used to cancel one-loop
tadpole corrections which drastically reduces the number of vacuum graphs for the free energy, as utilized before in
[5,6].

in section iii we treat the asymmetric case for the free energy w [g, j]. we derive identities for w [g, j] and

recursion relations for the feynman diagrams representing the connected greens functions.

in section iv we translate the identities for w [g, j] into identities for the eective energy [g, ] and subsequently
derive recursion relations for the one-particle irreducible (1pi) feynman diagrams representing the proper vertices of
the theory. we nally present how part of the quadratic term can be treated as a perturbation to cancel all tadpole
corrections to propagators in graphs needed for the proper vertices with one or more external legs, thereby drastically
reducing the number of diagrams.

section v contains a summary of our results and an outlook.

ii. symmetric case

a. denitions

consider a scalar eld  with n components in d euclidean dimensions whose thermal uctuations are controlled

by the energy functional

e[, g, , l] =

1

2z12(cid:0)g1

12 + 12(cid:1) 12 +

1

24z1234

l12341234,

(1)

where l1234 is a self-coupling and where we keep the option open to treat a part 12 of the quadratic term in e as a

perturbation. the numerical indices of r , g1,  and l are meant as a short-hand and represent spatial as well as

tensorial arguments,

1  {x1, 1}, z1

x1 z ddx1, 1  1 (x1),

g1

12  g1

12 (x1, x2), 12  12(x1, x2), l1234  l1234 (x1, x2, x3, x4).

for example, in standard 4 theory we would have

g1

12 (x1, x2) = 12 (x1  x2)(cid:0)1  2 + m2(cid:1) ,

12 (x1, x2) = m212 (x1  x2),

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

l1234 (x1, x2, x3, x4) =

1
3

(12 34 + 13 24 + 14 23 )(x1  x2)(x1  x3)(x1  x4),

(6)

where m2 could represent a modication of m2 that we want to treat perturbatively.

using natural units, where the boltzmann constant kb times the temperature t equals unity, the partition function

z and the negative free energy w are given by a functional integral over the boltzmann weight exp(e[]),

z[g, , l] = exp(w [g, , l]) =z d exp(e[, g, , l]).

(7)

b. identity for wi

regarding w as a functional of the kernel g1, we can derive a functional dierential equation for w . our starting

point is the identity

z d


1

{2 exp(e[, g, , l])} = 0,

(8)

which follows from functional partial integration and the vanishing of the exponential at innite elds.

carrying out the 1-derivative, replacing appearances of i with appropriate derivatives with respect to g1 and
nally using the results of appendix a to translate all such derivatives into derivatives with respect to g yields an
identity for w ,

note that a derivative with respect to g graphically means removing (amputating) a line from a feynman graph
(for details see [3] and appendix a). this will be important when we represent wi as a sum of feynman graphs in
the next section. for example, the operation on wi on the left hand side of (18) multiplies each graph in wi by the
number of its lines.

table iii. remaining diagrams with their weights through six loops with a one-loop adjusted two-point insertion.

in table iii we list the diagrams with their weights through six loops that are left after adjusting the two-point
insertion according to (39). through four and ve loops this adjustment has been used in [5] and [6], respectively, to
simplify the renormalization of the vacuum energy in 4 theory, which is used for the computation of some universal
critical amplitude ratios [7].

as an alternative to explicitly constructing the graphs in table ii by recursion relations, we could replace the

propagator in the graphs of table i according to

g1  g1 + ,

g  (g1 + )1 = g(1 + g)1 = g + gg + ggg + . . .

i.e.

with

diagrammatically, this amounts to replacing

and adding up the resulting graphs through the appropriate loop order. the result is again the graphs in table iii
with the same weights.

iii. general case

a. denitions

now let us generalize our treatment to the case with general interactions through four powers in the eld,

e[, c, j, g, k, l] = c +z1

2z12

l12341234,

(47)

where g1
background eld , i.e.

12 , k123, l1234 are symmetric in their indices. e.g., for a z2-symmetric single-component 4 theory with

e[] =z1h 1

2 ( + )2 + 1

2 m2( + )2 + 1

24 ( + )4 + ci1

,

we would have

c =z1h 1

2 ()2 + 1

2 m22 + 1

24 4 + ci1

,

j1 = 21 + m21 + 1

g1

12 = 12(cid:0)1  2 + m2 + 1

2 12(cid:1) ,

k123 = 12131,

the partition function z and the negative free energy w are given by

l1234 = 121314.

z[c, j, g, k, l] = exp(w [c, j, g, k, l]) =z d exp(e[, c, j, g, k, l]).

(48)

(49)

(50)

(51)

(52)

(53)

(54)

the energy is now regarded as a function of c and a functional of , j, g, k, l. we will mainly be interested in

its dependence on , j, g.

b. identities for wi

we continue with deriving identities similar to (9). we now have the possibility to represent each occurrence of the
eld  by a derivative with respect to j. we keep the number of these derivatives at a minimum and use as much as
possible derivatives with respect to g to keep the identities and the recursion relations derived from them as simple
as possible.

the identities we need are

c. change of variables

instead of representing (64)-(66) graphically, let us rst perform a change of variables that reduces the amount of
work needed for solving the recursion relations to be derived. since j is always connected to a free propagator g, we
can as well dene a modied current

j1 =z2

g12j2

which already incorporates this propagator. then (64) can be rewritten as

w0[c, j , g] = c +

1

2z12

g1
12

j1 j2 

1

2z1

(ln g1)11.

(67)

(68)

performing this change of variables introduces into the w identities double derivatives with respect to j which we
would like to avoid in favor of derivatives with respect to free correlation function g. this can be achieved with the
result

and a recursion relation which we write down only for n = 0, since for n > 0 the simpler relation (89) can be used:

from (77) follow again equations leading with (79) to (85)-(88), but also

eq. (92) is valid for l > 2.

note that in (92)but not in (89)the right hand side involves graphs with more legsnamely one morethan the
left hand side. this implies that for the generation of vacuum graphs, we have to consider also one-point functions.
for all others it is enough to consider only diagrams with equal or less numbers of legs. note further that if all
lower loop orders contain only connected graphs, then the recursion relations generate only connected graphs. this
establishes by induction that w generates only connected graphs, as shown before in [1,2].

as an example, we compute w (3,0) in appendix c. combining (83), (91) and the result (c13) of appendix c, we

get w at j = 0 in the three-loop approximation,

w [j = 0] = s +

at this low loop order, it is still relatively easy to check that the weights come out the same when using the com-
binatorial prescriptions that come with the usual feynman rules. i have written a computer code implementing the
recursion relations for the connected graphs. if we restrict ourselves to the symmetric case, it reproduces the graphs
and multiplicities (trivially related to the weights, see [3]) of tables i through iii in [3] and also all relevant entries in
tables v through vii there.

except for the vacuum diagrams, we still have to use (81) to convert the graphs representing w into connected
to the connected four-point function

greens functions. for example, to compute the zero-loop contribution g(c)(0,4)
we combine (81) and (86) to get

that is, each diagram with n external currents is multiplied by n!, supplied by external arguments replacing the js
and then splits into crossed graphs related by exchanging external arguments. the external legs represent free
correlation functions g.

iv. effective energy

often in eld theory, one is interested rather in the eective energy or eective action  than the free energy w

and rather in the 1pi feynman diagrams than the connected ones.

therefore, we translate in the following the identities for w into identities for  and derive recursion relations for

the 1pi feynman diagrams representing the proper vertices.

a. relations between w and 

since the physical situation in which we are interested does not necessarily correspond to j = 0, let us for the
purpose of performing a legendre transform introduce an additional source j into the denition of the partition
function z and the negative free energy w ,

z[ j, c, j, g, k, l] = exp(w [ j, c, j, g, k, l]) =z d exp(cid:18)e[, c, j, g, k, l] +z1

j11(cid:19) .

note that we trivially have the relations

and

z[ j, c, j, g, k, l] = z[c, j  j, g, k, l]

w [ j, c, j, g, k, l] = w [c, j  j, g, k, l]

between the quantities dened in (54) and those in (95). with (64) follows then that

w0[ j, c, j, g]  w [ j, c, j, g, k, l]|k,l=0 = w [c, j  j, g, k, l]|k,l=0 = w0[c, j  j, g]

= c +

dene the eective energy  by the legendre transform

[, c, j, g, k, l] = w [ j, c, j, g, k, l] +z1

j11,

where the new variable  is dened by

which implicitly denes j as functional of . as usual we have

1 =(cid:18) w

 j1(cid:19)c,j,g,k,l

,

= j1.

(101)

notice that as intended by introducing the extra source term and performing the legendre transform with respect to
j instead of j, we do not have to set j = 0 but only j = 0 to have a proper eective energy giving us the equation
of state (or the equation of motion if we consider an eective action) through its stationary points.

17

in the following, we assume c, j, k, l to be xed and do not treat them as variables. let us use the notation

(cid:18) 2f
x1x2(cid:19)(y1y2)

(cid:18) 

x1(cid:19)y1(cid:18) 

x2(cid:19)y2

f.

(102)

for deriving identities for  we rst need some relations between the functional derivatives of w and . with (100)

and (101) we get

p12 (cid:18) 2w

for  = 0, p is the usual propagator. it will turn out useful to reexpress p12 as

=

eq. (143) is valid for l > 2.

note that in (143)but not in (139)the right hand side involves graphs with more legsnamely one morethan
the left hand side. this implies that for the generation of vacuum graphs, we have to consider also one-point functions.
for all others it is enough to consider only diagrams with equal or less numbers of legs. note further that if all lower
loop orders contain only 1pi graphs then the recursion relations also generate only 1pi graphs. this establishes by
induction that  generates only 1pi graphs, as shown before in [1,2].

as an example, we compute (3,0) in appendix d. combining (135), (142) and the result (d3) of appendix d, we

get the eective energy  at  = 0 in the three-loop approximation,

where propagator and vertices may contain a background-eld dependence as given e.g. by (49) through (53). the
corresponding eective potential v in this model is then given by [ = 0, c, j, g, k, l] = v (), where  is the
volume of d-dimensional space. that is, it can be computed from vacuum graphs with constant background eld .
note that the right hand side of (144) is the right hand side of (93) with the one-particle reducible graphs omitted.

except for the vacuum diagrams, we still have to use (134) to convert the graphs representing  into proper vertices.

greens functions, the external legs carry only the external arguments and do not represent free correlation functions

d. graphs for renormalization

for the purpose of perturbatively renormalizing standard 4 theory, we need the 1pi feynman diagrams representing
(l,0), (l,2) and (l,4) for the case j = k = 0. all (l,n) with odd n are then identically zero. the recursion relation
for vacuum graphs with l > 2 results from writing (143) for j = k = 0 and then making use of (78) with n1 = n3 = 0,

for n = 2 and n = 4 we rewrite (139) with j = k = 0. for (l,2) we get for l > 1

since now we have written down only the recursion relations without starting with the identities for i again, we
use for the low-order terms not covered by (147)-(149) just the results (135), (137), (138), (142) of section iv c with
j = k = 0,

it is now easy to use (147)-(149) to obtain e.g. (compare to the 1pi graphs in the tables in [3]; for the vacuum

graphs, compare also with table i in this work)

in this way, all the graphs needed for the renormalization of 4 theory can be obtained (for a ve-loop treatment see
[8,9]). there is no need to go beyond l loop order to determine all 1pi zero-, two- and four-point graphs through l
loops. i have written a computer code implementing the recursion relations for the 1pi graphs. if we restrict ourselves
to the symmetric case, it reproduces the 1pi graphs and their multiplicities (trivially related to the weights, see [3])
of tables i through iii in [3] and also all relevant entries in tables v through vii there.

here we discuss the absorption of tadpoles, i.e. -independent subdiagrams of the form

e. absorption of tadpoles

into the propagator for diagrams representing the proper vertices (l,n) with n > 0 in the theory. for standard 4
theory, this amounts to an absorption of momentum-independent propagator corrections into the mass. this drasti-
cally reduces the amount of remaining diagrams and therefore simplies the bookkeeping for higher-loop calculations
[10].

for l > 1, all tadpole corrections to propagators in 1pi n-point functions with n > 0 will be canceled. this drastically
reduces the number of diagrams to be considered at higher loop orders. notice that with (122), the insertions (170)
and (171) can be summarized by writing

12 = 

,

(172)

i.e. by inserting the full propagator into a one-loop tadpole [compare to (103) and the comment following it]. it turns
out that this cancellation is also true for

but not for

i.e. not for the vacuum graphs with their proper weights. a simple diagrammatical explanation for this failure is that
the combinatorics do not work out since as a matter of principle it is undened which part of a vacuum diagram with
a cutvertex (a vertex which connects two otherwise unconnected parts of a diagram) is the tadpole and which part
is the rest of the diagram. a reection of this problem was already encountered in section ii d, where the two-loop
diagram (42) survived our one-loop resummation.

let us emphasize that the values (170) and (171) for the two-point insertions have to be used after evaluating the

recursion relations.

let us now establish the connection between our resummation above and the one used in [10]. in that work, a
distinction is established between -independent subdiagrams of the form (157), called snail diagrams there, and
-independent subdiagrams of the forms

called tadpole diagrams there. ref. [10] uses the usual schwinger-dyson equations to adjust the triple coupling
and mass such that there are no more graphs of the n-point functions with n > 1 to consider for the eective action
(equivalent to the eective energy in our treatment) that contain any snail or tadpole subdiagrams.

one notices that graphs of the form (175) are absent altogether in our treatment of the eective energy, which
contains only truly 1pi diagrams in contrast to a weaker denition of one-particle irreducibility used in [10], which
allows also for -independent subdiagrams of the form (175). this absence can be traced to the fact that we work
with a general background eld  in (48). for the computation of scattering processes,  has to be adjusted to the
radiatively corrected vacuum expectation value v of , i.e. the true minimum of the eective potential, whose shift from
the tree-level value v0 can perturbatively be computed as a sum v = v0 + corrections. if we expanded v subsequently
in our graphs, the corrections would lead to exactly the diagrams containing tadpole diagrams as subdiagrams
used as a starting point in [10]. in other words, the formalism we use already takes care of the resummation of all
tadpoles (175) in the eective action, so that the triple coupling and the mass experience an appropriate correction
when computing the corrections to v0 and setting  = v. this has nothing to do with our recursion relations, but
could have been used by the authors of [10] from the start as well.

for the other class of subdiagrams, the snail diagrams (157), our result (172) agrees with the result of [10] that
the sum of all such subdiagrams amounts to a full propagator in a one-loop snail diagram and that therefore an
appropriate split of the mass term in standard 4 theory will achieve a cancellation of all such snail diagrams.

v. discussion

in this work we have derived ecient recursion relations to generate connected and 1pi feynman diagrams for 4
theory both with and without    symmetry. although we used also external sources j and eld expectations
 as functional variables, we were able to keep the recursion relations simple by using as much as possible the free
propagator g as a functional variable.

taking w as functional of both g and j and  as functional of both g and  allowed us to combine the advantages
of both the current approach and the kernel approach [3]: by considering diagrams with arguments j and 
on the external legs we avoided having to deal with crossed diagrams which are related by exchanging external
arguments on their legs. this helps keep the number of diagrams at intermediate steps low. only when we nally
want to convert the coecient functions of w and  (in an expansion in powers of j and , respectively) into greens
functions as in (94) or (146) do we have to consider crossed diagrams.

the applications of the recursion relations lie potentially in both statistical and particle physics. together with a
powerful numeric integration method, the relations could be used to push the computation of critical exponents in
three dimensions to higher loop orders, see e.g. [9,11,12].

similar recursion relations can be set up for theories with other eld contents as well. they are a convenient starting
point for the investigation of resummations of classes of feynman diagrams. simple one-loop and multi-loop tadpole
resummation examples were given in sections ii d and iv e, respectively. since the identities from which the recursion
relations are derived are non-perturbative, they might also be useful for other expansions than the ones organized by
the number of loops or powers of coupling constants. another eld for future investigations is the systematic solution
of recursion relations for legendre transforms of higher order than the eective energy [1,2,13]. also, the exploitation
of derivatives with respect to tensors representing interactions as in [4] seems promising to further simplify identities
and recursion relations.

when considering symmetric tensors g and g1, we have to dene what we mean by derivatives with respect to
them. while (a2), (a4) and (a6) obviously need appropriate symmetrizations, we would like to keep (a1), (a5) and
(a7) untouched.

let us for the following considerations keep h unconstrained and dene g to be its symmetric part,

g12 

1
2

(h12 + h21) .

dene the derivative with respect to g by



g12



so that with (a1) immediately follows

1

2(cid:18) 

h12

+



h21(cid:19) ,

(cid:20) 

g12

,



g34(cid:21) = 0.

(a8)

(a9)

(a10)

then, if /g12 acts on a functional that depends on h only through g, it acts exactly to remove an appearance of
g in a symmetric way,

g12
g34

=

1

4(cid:18) 

h34

+



h43(cid:19) (h12 + h21) =

1
2

(1324 + 1423) .

(a11)

we also need derivatives with respect to g1, which is also symmetric in its indices. since in general the symmetrized
version of h 1 is not identical to g1, it turns out to be inconvenient to dene derivatives with respect to g1 by
just replacing g and h by g1 and h 1 in (a9), respectively. dene instead



g1
12

 z34

g13g24



g34

,

29

(a12)

which trivially implies

using (a10) and (a11) it is easy to check that



g12

g1

13 g1

and therefore

we get

=

and therefore, repeating the steps that lead to (a16) with the roles of g and g1 exchanged,

g12
g1
34

= 

1
2

(g13g24 + g14g23) .

(a18)

the upshot of these considerations is that we can work with symmetric g and g1 in the rst place if we use the

equations (a10) and (a12)-(a14), as well as the symmetrized relations (a11) and (a16)-(a18).

appendix b: elimination of (2wi / j1 j2)g

in the course of changing variables from j to j in section iii c, double derivatives with respect to j appear.
however, we want to replace this kind of terms with derivatives with respect to g to keep the resulting recursion
relations as simple as possible.

from the denition (54) of z and w we have
