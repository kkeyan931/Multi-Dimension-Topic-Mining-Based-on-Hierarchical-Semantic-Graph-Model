abstract

supersymmetric -models obtained by constraining linear supersymmetric eld theo-

ries are ill dened. well dened subsectors parametrising kahler manifolds exist but

are not believed to arise directly from constrained linear ones. a counterexample is

oered using improved understanding of membranes in superstring theories leading

to crucial central terms modifying the algebra of supercharge densities.

massless goldstone bosons arise from components of global symmetries which are

spontaneously broken. there is no extra symmetry for goldstone bosons in super-

symmetr instead the supersymmetry forces complexication of scalars. this leads

to an increased number of massless excitations in general, with complete doubling

of the original number in some cases. the special cases when the coset space man-

ifold, g/h, of the original goldstone bosons is kahler might be expected to be an

exception in view of the seminal work of zumino [1]. this does indeed conrm that a

non-linear supersymmetry model can be established without any increase in the num-

ber of goldstone bosons. however the theorem frequently attributed to lerche and

shore, following early work by ong [2], appears to prove that such models can never

result from constraining linear supersymmetric ones. the formal proofs in lerche

[3], and in kotche and shore [4], reveal a striking similarity to the work of witten

[5], in which the impossibility of partially breaking extended global supersymmetries

(n > 1) to lower values was proposed. indeed it was this similarity which prompted

the current work. once bagger and wess [6], and subsequently hughes, liu and

polchinski [7] had produced (nonlinear) counter examples to the witten analysis it

seemed likely that the lerche and shore proofs would also fail, the key contribution

could be argued to be that of hughes and polchinski [8], which revealed that the

original anticommutator algebra for supersymmetric charges had to be generalised to

include a central term at the underlying current density level. they attributed this

revision to the more modern viewpoint that supermembranes are just as fundamental

as elementary particles in string theory.

this reinterpretation is the current starting point. the generalisation of

nqa, qb o = 2() ab

(1)

to local form is

1

a(x)j

t (cid:16)j

b (y)(cid:17) = 2 ()  t 

 4(x  y)ab + 2 ()  cab4(x  y),

(2)

where schwinger terms which are irrelevant to this analysis are ignored [8]. the

key feature is provided by the central terms cab which give innities of unclear

covariance on integration over xed volume. possibly this was why this was previously

overlooked. one might wonder if equation (2) could be restricted by the fact that

the hughes and polchinski treatment was in two dimensions. but they appear to be

taking advantage of the fact that t  is not the unique conserved symmetric tensor

since t  + c is also conserved. this does not depend on being in two or fewer

dimensions.

it seems that this is one of those situations where the symmetry of

the hamiltonian is larger than the symmetry of the s-matrix. at any rate equation

(2) is clearly nite and lorentz invariant. from it follow the usual consequences

of degenerate multiplets for unbroken supersymmetries and goldstone fermions for

those that are broken. in momentum space, with cab diagonal and < t  >= ,

we have

q < j

a(q)j

a  >= 2 ()  ( + caa) + 0(q)

(3)

where there is no sum over a. for those a such that  + caa 6= 0, equation (3)
implies a 1/ 6 q singularity in the two current correlations, j 
a couples the vacuum
to a massless fermion with coupling strength [2( + caa)]1/2.

it also follows that

 + caa  0. it should now be obvious how to evade the extra unwanted goldstone
bosons, in the case where the underlying coset manifold is indeed kahler. the classical

analyses of coleman, wess and zumino [9], and callan, coleman, wess and zumino

[10] were extended in the case of non-linearly realised supersymmetry by volkov and

akulov [11]. this paper follows the elegant treatment of itoh, kugo and kunitoma

[12] based upon the very complete generalisations of the classical analyses by bando,

kuramoto, maskawa and uehara [13], and the same authors in [14] and [15]. finally,

2

we bring attention to the further clarications made by volkov [16] and so elegantly

presented by ogievetsky [17].

the crucial point of extending the underlying algebra of supercharge current den-

sities by central terms, has to be combined not merely with a kahler g/h, but that

manifold has to be re-expressed as a quotient space of the complexied g (usually

called gc ) by a maximially extended complex extension of h (usually called h). in

this treatment this will appear as an explicit mapping manifesting the homeomor-

phism between g/h and gc/ h.

a concrete example is oered in the form of the simplest possible case of g/h =

su2/u1, usually called the complex projective space cp 2, although it is a straight-

forward task to extend to all similar (i.e. kahler) but more complicated cases. the

starting point is a recent, interesting but incomplete, attempt to generalise the ideas

of chiral perturbation theory to the supersymmetric level by barnes, ross and sim-

mons [18]. it is instructive to see how the ambiguities arise in this chiral su2  su2
based model and we adapt the notation of the original only slightly. the original

(unconstrained) supersymmetric action is constructed from four (complex) chiral su-

perelds. in components, with

ym = xm + im ,

these have the form

(x,  ) = (y) + 2(y) + 2f(y),
3(x, , ) = 3(y) + 23(y) + 2f(y),
a(x, , ) = a(y) + 2a(y) + 2fa(y),

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

where m = (1,  a), and the  a are the pauli matrices (a = 1, 2, 3). the chiral
superelds a(a = 1, 2), and 3 transform as a triplet under su2, where the third

direction is that of the intended spontaneous breaking, and  is a singlet.

it has

3

previously been noted by barnes, generowicz and grimshare [19] that the chiral

su2 generated by the rst two components of the axial generators together with the

third component of the vector generators leads indeed to a kahler manifold of the

type su2/u1. this is embedded in the chiral su2su2

su2

structure exactly so as to give

the a pseudoscalar nature in their real parts, and correspondingly  and 3 scalar

nature. the most general supersymmetric action is then written as

i = z d8z(  + 33 + aa) +z d6sw +z d6sw ,

(8)

where the superpotential w is a functional of chiral superelds only. combining the

3 and a elds into the matrix

m = 3 3 + a a,

(9)

where the chiral 5 factors are now suppressed, reveals that, under chiral su2  su2,
m transforms as

and taking

m  lmr,

w = k(det m + f 2

),

(10)

(11)

where k is a constant, ensures that the model reduces to the usual bosonic chiral

model below the supersymmetry breaking scale provided that f is required to be real.
notice that 2 of reference [18] now appears in the guise of (3)2. the advantage
of this change of notation will become clear later. this starting action now yields the

potential

the minimum of this potential is clearly v = 0 which may be achieved by giving the

elds the following su2  su2 breaking vacuum expectation values (vevs)

< 3 >= f < a >= 0 =<  > .

(13)

v = f f + fa fa + f f
= 4k2 (33 + aa)
+k2[f 2
3  aa][f 2

  2

  2

3  a a].

(12)

importantly no auxiliary eld acquires a vev with these assignments so super-

symmetry is manifestly not broken in this model. the formal limit k   leaves the
action

i = z d8z(3 3 + a a +  ),

with the superelds subject to the constraint

2

3 + aa = f 2
,

(14)

(15)

with the consequence that the supereld  takes no part in the interactions and

can be ignored as spectator eld. eliminating 3, 3 and f3 by substituting the

constraints into the kinetic part of the lagrangian to obtain the leading term in

the low momentum expansion (each fermion is considered to have associated with

it a factor of the square root of the momentum scale) gives exactly the non-linear

(zumino) lagrangian as reported in reference [18]. as stated there, the interaction

terms involving pseudo-goldstone bosons and, or, the fermionic superpartners are not

uniquely specied. however, the structure of the non-linear lagrangian describing

the goldston pions alone (when the scalar elds are taken to be real, and the fermions

supressed), is quite independent of the structure in which it is is now embedded. this

applies also to the kahler subset of elds, but in the previous conventional wisdom

this subsector alone was prohibited from arising in this manner by the theorem of

lerche and shore. finally, it is necessary to express the manifold in the gc/ h complex

form. the key is to introduce the projection operator  with the properties 2 = 

and  =  which is made possible because of the change in the underlying algebra

of supercharge densities with the central terms. this can be taken, in this notation,

to be

and it is trivial to conrm that the property

picks out  + and  3 as the four members of the complex subgroup. (there is a two

way alternative choice at this point, but this has become standard.) with this in

mind rewriting m as

m = 3 3 +

so that, now leaving out the f 2

 terms,

i = z d8z(3 3 +

in the formal limit as k  , the action becomes

as the constraints are satised by the supereld conditions

3 = 0 and  = 0.

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

(22)

the supereld  can again be ignored as a non-interacting spectator. notice that the

single complex supereld  is all that remains in the action, and it is not constrained.

to describe the coset space of the chiral sphere [19], the real part of a is written

as m a, and so

l = exp(i

()

ma a

 ) ,

where () is any arbitrary function of

 = [mam a]1/2,

(23)

(24)

divided by the pion decay constant f, and where the chiral 5 dependence is again

suppressed. the arbitrariness may be viewed as the freedom to change coordinate

systems on the surface of the sphere, or to redene the eld variables describing the

pions. now this can alternatively be written in the form [12]

l = exp i 

2 ! exp i +

2 ! exp v  3
2 ! ,

(25)

using the complex subgroup h. moreover the expression

exp i 
2 !

gives the explicit mapping of the homeomorphism between g/h and gc/ h. in the

general coordinate system

and it is known from reference [12] that the kahler potential is given by

k = lndet(exp  i +

2 ! exp i 

2 !) ,

(26)

(27)

where the notation indicates that the determinant is to be taken in the top left hand

corner of the matrix in this representation. this reveals at once that

k = ln(cid:20)1 +



2 (cid:21) = ln"sec2  

2!# = v

(28)

which is the desired result. note that, although the general coordinate notation is

most convenient in this context, reliance is placed on the results of reference [12].

the kahler nature of the potential is demonstrated by diagonalizing the metric in

stereographic coordinates, z and z, and revealing the holomorphic nature of the trans-

formations in the usual manner.

although this demonstration that kahler potentials can arise from constrained

linear supersymmetric schemes has used only cp 2, there seems no reason whatsoever

why this can not be generalised directly to larger kahler manifolds  in particular to

cp n.
