abstract

in this paper the gulers formalism for the systems with nite de-
grees of freedom is applied to the eld theories with constraints. the
integrability conditions are investigated and the path integral quantiza-
tion is performed using the action given by hamilton-jacobi formula-
tion. the procas model is investigated in details.

1 introduction

the most common method for investigating the hamiltonian treatment of con-
straints was initiated by dirac[1]. the main feature of his method is to con-
sider primary constraints rst.all constraints are obtained using consistency
conditions. hence , equations of motion are obtained in terms of arbitrary
parameters.

the starting point of the gulers method[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8] is the vari-
ational principle. the hamiltonian treatment of constrained systems leads us
to total dierential equations in many variables.the equations are integrable
if the corresponding system of partial dierential equations is a jacobi system.
recently guler has presented a treatment of classical elds as constrained
systems[9]. then hamiltonian-jacobi quantization of the nite dimensional
system with constraints was investigated in [10]. the purpose of this paper

is to generalize the gulers formalism for the system with nite degrees of
freedom in order to include the eld theories with constraints also.

the plan of this paper is the following: in sec.2 the gulers formalism
for the theories of elds with constraints is presented and the integrability
conditions are investigated.
in sec.3 the quantization of procas model is
analyzed. in sec.4 we present our conclusions.

2 g ulers formalism for the eld theories with

constraints

we generalize gulers for the nite dimensions with constraints([10]) in order
to describe the eld theories with constraints. let suppose that the local eld
theories are described by the lagrangean

l(i,

i
x

), i = 1,    , n

(1)

the canonical formulation gives the set of hamiltonian-jacobi partial-

dierential equation as

h



(, ,

s


,

s


where

) = 0, ,  = 0, n  r + 1,    , n, a = 1,    , n  r,

(2)

h



 = h(, a, a) + 

(3)

and h0 is the canonical hamiltonian. the equations of motion are obtained as
total dierential equations in many variables as follows

da =



h

a

d, da = 



h

a

d, d = 



h



d,  = 1,    , r

(4)

dz = (h + a



h

a

)d

where z = s(, a).the set of equations(4,5) is integrable if

dh



0 = 0, dh



 = 0,  = 1,    r

(5)

(6)

if conditions(6) are not satised identically , one consider them as a new
constraints and again tests the consistency conditions. thus repeating this
procedure one may obtain a set of conditions.

2.1

integrability conditions

if eqs.(4) are integrable , then the solutions of eqs.(5) are obtained by quadra-
ture.hence, the investigation of the integrability condition of eqs.(4) is suf-
cient. as was discussed in[2] equations of motion of a singular system are
total dierential equations. as it is well known, to any set of total dierential
equations

dxi = bi(t, xj)dt, i, j = 1,    , n, ,  = 0, 1    , p < n

(7)

there are corresponding set of partial dierential equations in the form

bi

f
xi

= 0

now we may investigate the integrability conditions of the equations (4).

to achieve this aim we dene the linear operators x as

xf = bi

f
xi

for the eld theory we will dene the linear operators x as

xf (, a, a) = [f, h

suppose that (11) is satised. then

(12)

we get after using jacobis identity

(x, x)f = [f, [h

]]

from(11) and (13) we conclude that

(x, x) = 0

(13)

(14)

conversely , if the system is complete , then(14) is satised for any  and 
and we get

[h

2.2 quantization of eld theories with constraints

in this section we will investigate the quantization of the elds with constraints
using gulers formalism.

let suppose that for a eld with constraints we found all independent
 using the calculus of variations[2],[4],[6].at this stage we can

hamiltonians h
use diracs procedure of quatization[1]. we have



h



 = 0,  = 0, n  r + 1,    , n

where  is the wave function. the consistency conditions are

[h



, h



] = 0, ,  = 1,    r

where [, ] is the commutator. if the hamiltonians h



 satises

[h



, h



] = c 

 h





then we have a theory with a rst class constraints.

in the case when the hamiltonians h



 satises

[h



, h



] = c

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

with c not depending on i and i, from(17) we arise naturally at diracs
brackets and the canonical quatization will be performed taking diracs brack-
ets into commutators.



on the other hand gulers formalism give us an action when all hamilto-
nians h
 are in involution. because in gulers formalism we work from the
beginning in the extended space we suppose that variables  depend of  .here
 is canonical conjugate with p0.

if we are able , for a given system with constraints, to nd the independent
hamiltonians h
 in involution then we can perform the quantization of this
system using path integral quantization method with the action given by(5).
after some calculations we found that the action z has the following form



z = z (h + a



h

a

) d

where  = d
d .

the procas model is described by the lagrangian

l =

(20)

(21)

the form of the hamiltonian in gulers formalism is:



0 = p0 +z " 2

where

m2

2 (cid:16)a2

0 + a2

i(cid:17)2

the systems possess rst primary constraint

2 = ii + m2a0

imposing

we get another constraint

h



1 = 0

dh



0 = 0

h2 = ii + m2a0

 a02# d3x

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

then in the gulers formalism we have three hamiltonians. the hamilto-

nian h2 is not yet in the form (3). because

[h



1, h2] = m2 (x  y)

(27)

the hamiltonians are not in involution. at this stage we can investigate the
canonical quantization method using diracs formalism. from (27) we conclude
that the system have two second class constraints in diracs classication and
for canonical quantization we need diracs brackets

{f, g}d.b. = {f, g}  {f, h



2}c 21{h



1, g}  {f, h



1}c 12{h



2, g}

(28)

where

{, } are the poisson-brackets and the matrix c  is the inverse of the matrix

c = (cid:18)

0

m2(x  y)

m2(x  y)

0

(cid:19)

(29)

on the other hand in the gulers formalism we have an action which is
well dened when the hamiltonians are in involution. in our case we found the
hamiltonians 

2 in involution in the following form

1,

0,











1 + m2 = 0 + 1
1 = h

2 = h2 +  =  + 2

0 = p0 + h (1) + h (2) = p0 + 0






where

h (1) = z d3x(cid:20)(cid:16)iai(cid:17) m2 



m2 (cid:16)ii + m2a0(cid:17)(cid:21)

and ,  are the extra elds satisfying {, } = 1 all the following commuta-
tions become zero.

the action z has the following form

dz = [0+z (2

or

i

(34)

z = z d d3x{[0 +z (2
here a0 = da0
d and  = d
d .

for a system with r rst class-constraints  the path integral representa-

tion is given as[11]



< 

| exp[i(t



 t) h0] |  >= z y d(, )exp[i{z +



dt(   h0)}]
(35)

where the measure of integration is given as

d(, ) = det | {, } | y ()()y dd

and  are r- gauge constraints.

(36)

we found after some calculations that the action(34) give us the same result
as(35) for the procas model when  = t but using dierent gauge conditions.

4 concluding remarks

guler has initiated a new formalism for quantization of systems with con-
straints [2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8]. in this paper we have generalized the gulers
formalism for the system with nite degrees of freedom[10] to the eld theo-
ries with constraints.our formalism is completely dierent from the formalism
presented in[9].

an interesting case appears when a theory has secondary constraints and
the constraints are of second class in the diracs classication. we found
that for the system with second class constraints the diracs brackets arise
naturally in the process of quantization for eld with constraints in the gulers
formalism. the diracs brackets are dened on the extended space.

when the system with constraints has only primary constraints in invo-
lution gulers formalism give us exactly the action which has the same ex-
pression as obtained in the path integral quantization after performing all
calculations.in this case, in the gulers formalism we do not need any gauge

conditions. if the system has secondary constraints or second class constraints
this result is not valid because the hamitonians are not in involution.to obtain
the system in involution we need to extend the system. because in the gulers
formalism we have the freedom to choose the dependence of gauge variables 
we will choose  = ( ). in this case the action of gulers formalism gives
the same results as path integral formulation for the system with constraints.
for the procas model we extend the system and we found three hamilto-
nians in involution. the path integral quantization was performed with an
action given by gulers formalism and the results are in agreement with those
obtained by other methods.
