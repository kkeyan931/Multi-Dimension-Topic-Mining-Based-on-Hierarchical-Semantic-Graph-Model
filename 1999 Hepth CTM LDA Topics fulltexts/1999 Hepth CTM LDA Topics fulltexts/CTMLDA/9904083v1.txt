abstract

it is shown that the eective theory of d-particles has conformal
symmetry with eld-dependent parameters. this is a consequence
of the supersymmetry. the string coupling constant is not trans-
formed in contrast with the recent proposal of generalized conformal
symmtery by jevicki et al.[5][6] this conformal symmetry can also be
generalized to other dp-brane systems.

1 introduction

duality between string theory in anti-de sitter (ads) background space-
time and conformal eld theory was conjectured in [1]. this correspondence
was further elaborated in [2]. especially near-horizon geometry of nearly
coincident d3-branes[3] is ads5(s5) and its isometry is the conformal sym-
metry. on the other hand four-dimensional n = 4 supersymmetric yang-
mills (sym) theory is conformally invariant. it was shown in [4] that there
is a correspondence between the conformal symmetries on both sides.

near-horizon geometry of other dp-branes is not ads space-time and
this conjecture does not simply apply. the corresponding sym theory is not
apparently conformally invariant because the coupling constant is dimen-
sionful. recently, however, it was pointed out by jevicki et al[5][6] that the
near-horizon geometry of dp-branes can also be interpreted as conformally
invariant, if one varies the string coupling constant together with other back-
grounds. then they claimed that by regarding the coupling constant of sym
theory as a background eld and transforming this background appropriately
with other elds, they can also make sym theory confomally invariant. they
also argued that the 2 conformal transformations on the sym and supergrav-
ity sides are related by some coordinate transformations.[6]

we will not adopt this proposal to regard the coupling constant as a
background, because a coordinate-dependent coupling constant breaks the
special conformal symmetry as well as supersymmetry (susy). (see sec 4.)
the coupling constant must be kept constant. in this paper we will specialize
to the d-particle system and show that this system has conformal symmetry.
for this purpose we will use the susy transformation to induce a variation
of the functional measure which is equivalent to eectively changing the cou-
pling constant. additional brs transformation needs to be also performed.
the ordinary conformal transformation combined with the susy and brs
transformation yields the desired, complete conformal transformation.

in sec 2 we will show that by introducing an auxiliarly eld the susy
transformation can be extended to an o-shell-closed symmetry, with respect
to whose generator the d-particle action can be rewritten as an exact form.
this is the t-dual version of the nil-potent symmetry studied in [7]. in sec
3 this symmetry is used to eectively change the string coupling constant
in the action by transformation of the eld variables. the parameter of the
transformation is chosen to be eld-dependent and non-local.
in order to
cancel the variations of the gauge-xing and ghost action brs transforma-

2

tion with a eld-dependent parameter needs to be also performed. in sec 4
these results are used to show that d-particle eective theory has conformal
symmetry. discussions will be given in sec 5.

we could achieve the goal of this paper by working directly with trans-
formation (3). it is, however, more instructive to relate it to the nil-potent
transformation of [7]. let us introduce an auxiliarly seven-vector ~h by adding
~e by the equa-
tions of motion. the transformation rule of ~ is modied to ~ =  ~h.  ~h is
dened to be ([x 9, ~] + id~). now the square of this new transformation
turns out to be equivalent to a time translation up to a gauge transforma-
[q2, ~] = it~ + [x 9 + a0, ~], etc.1 here q is the generator of this

this action is the t-dual version of the cohomological action for d-instantons
considered in [7].

to quantize this model we will choose the background eld gauge. we
will decompose x i into a background eld bi and a quantum uctuation y i

x i = bi + y i

and choose a gauge function[6]

g = ta0 + i[bi, y i].

the gauge xing and ghost actions are given by

3 transformation with a eld-dependent pa-

rameter

because of the q-exact nature of action (4) the string coupling constant
g in (4) can be eectively changed by a q transformation of elds without
varying g explicitly. the variation g may even be a function of t. we will
carry out this program in two steps.

we rst perform a q transformation

qx a = ia,
qa0 = i,
q~ =  ~h,
qc = 0,

qx 9 = i,
qa = i([x 9, x a] + idx a),

q = dx 9,

g is brs exact and does not contribute to the path integral, the eect of the
transformation (10) is just to change g to g + g(t) in stot.

secondly, to cancel the variations (12) and (13) we perform the brs

transformation (9) with the parameter

 = z dttrn(cid:16)t  i[ba, a]  i[b9, ](cid:17) co .

(15)

while the total action is invariant, the functional measure changes as in (14).
it can be checked that this change cancels out (12) and (13) exactly.

to summarize, the combination

 = q + b

(16)

has the same eect as changing g into g + g(t). it is important to notice
that this innitesimal transformation cannot be repeated to generate a non-
constant g(t), because q symmetry is broken if g is not a constant.

4 conformal symmetry

(17)

(18)

(19)

it was claimed in [6] that dp-brane action has conformal symmetry pro-
vided one regards g as a background eld g(x) and makes it transformed

6

appropriately together with other elds. they called this symmetry a gen-
eralized conformal one.

the conformal group is generated by translation, dilatation and special
conformal transformation (sct). we will specialize to the d-particle case.
these 3 transformations on t are dened by

t = a (translation),
t = at
(dilatation),
t = at2

(sct).

(20)

(21)

(22)

here a is an innitesimal parameter. a eld f (t) of a scale dimension w is
then transformed as

nf (t) = a(nwtn1 + tnt)f (t)

(23)

for translation (n = 0), dilatation (n = 1) and sct (n = 2).

actions s and scoh are invariant under these transformations only if the

string coupling constant g is also transformed like

ng = 3antn1g.

(24)

2, 2 for x i, a0,  and ~h,
the scale dimensions w of the elds are 1, 1, 3
respectively. because (24) for sct (n = 2) depends on t explicitly, the
authors of [5] [6] proposed to regard g itself as a function of the coordinate
t and assumed a transformation rule

ng(t) = a(3ntn1 + tnt)g(t).

(25)

as for sgf and sgh these are not invariant under sct even if c and c
are assigned scale dimensions 0 and 1. by using the formalism of [10]
the authors of [6] then showed that the variations of these actions can be
cancelled by a non-local brs transformation (9) with  = n.3

n = n(n  1)iaz dttr ca0

(26)

we do not adopt their proporsal to regard g as a t-dependent background

eld g(t) because of the following reasons.

 once g is promoted to a function of t, then action (1) is no longer
invariant under sct because the integration by parts is used in the
proof of invariance. after a simple calculation we indeed obtain

2s = az dt

1

g(t)

ttr(x i)2.

(27)

3here n = 2 for sct. an index n is introduced for later convenience.

7

 if g is a function of t, s is not invariant under susy transformation
(2) due to the same reason as above. this symmetry is important and
cannot be abandoned.

for these reasons we will leave g a constant and will not change it. in
the previous sections we showed that the same eect as changing g can be
accomplished by transforming the eld variables. by combining (16) and the
brs transformation (9) with the parameter (26), we obtain the 3 conformal
transformations (n = 0, 1, 2),
nx i = a(ntn1 + tnt)x i  in t i  (n + n)[c, x i],
na0 = a(ntn1 + tnt)a0 + in t  + i(n + n)dc,
na = a(cid:18)3
n~ = a(cid:18)3
n = a(cid:18)3
nc = atntc  (n + n)c 2,
n c = a(2ntn1 + tnt) c + (n + n)
here the rst 2 lines are simplied by using . n and n are (17) and (18),
respectively, with g replaced by ng (24).

in the rest of this section we will compute the expectation value hnx ii,
which will become a symmetry transformation nbi of the eective action
[bi]. this may be performed in perturbative expansions in g. because n
(17) and n (18) are of order o(g1), it turns out that in order to obtain
o(gm) result we have to perform (m + 1)-loop calculation. here we will
present only the result of one-loop calculation ( o(g0)). the result and
details of two-loop calculation will be reported in a forthcoming paper [12].
the background eld bi(t) is diagonal and linear in t. we found up to

5 discussion

we found that the low-energy eective theory of d-particles is invariant
under conformal transformation (28). the transformation rule is obtained ex-
plicitly, although the parameters depend on the eld variables in a non-local
way. here we stress the point that g is not changed under the transformation.
we also found that the scale dimension of x i changed from 1 to  1
2 due to
quantum eects.

because the actions of dp-branes are related by t-dual transformation
[11], the procedure adopted in this paper is easily generalized to all dp-
branes. it can be veried that all dp-brane theories have similar conformal
symmetry. this conformal symmetry will put strong constraints on the cor-
relation functions. some lower-point functions may be obtained by solving
conformal ward-takahashi identities.[10] action (1) also denes the matrix
theory [9]. study of the conformal w-t identities may also shed some light
on the understanding of m theory.

another important issue is the ads/cft correspondence. because the
near-horizon geometry of dp-branes (p 6= 3) is not an ads space-time and
the conformal group is not its isometry, this correspondence does not simply
apply. because dp-brane system has turned out to have conformal symmetry,
however, it is expected that its near-horizon geometry may also have the
corresponding conformal symmetry. if such a symmetry is found, dp-brane
eective theory may also be interpreted as a boundary conformal eld theory
in the classical background of the dp-branes. it will play an important role in

9

determining the eective action for the radial distance of a probe dp-brane
in the background eld of n coincident dp-branes placed at the origin.[1]
the non-local nature of transformation (31), however, makes the problem
dicult and the realization of such symmetry on the supergravity side is not
yet clear. the calculation of hnx ii to higher orders may elucidate this
point. the result will be reported elsewhere[12].

finally, generalization of the present analysis to the superconformal trans-
formation will be straightforward and may be useful in putting further con-
straints on the dp-brane dynamics.
