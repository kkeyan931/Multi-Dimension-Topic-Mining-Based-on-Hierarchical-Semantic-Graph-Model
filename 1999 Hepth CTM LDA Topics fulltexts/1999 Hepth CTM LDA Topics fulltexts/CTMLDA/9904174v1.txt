abstract

a static, spherically symmetric and purely magnetic solution of the einstein-yang-
mills-dilaton theory, found previously by numerical integration is shown to obey
a system of rst order bogomolnyi equations. as common for such equations,
there is a tight relation to supersymmetry, in the present case to the n=4 gauged
su(2)su(2) supergravity of freedman and schwarz. specically, the dilaton po-
tential of the latter can be avoided by choosing one of the two gauge coupling
constants to be imaginary. it is argued that this corresponds to a hitherto unknown
n=4 gauged su(2)su(1,1) supergravity in four euclidean dimensions leading to
bogomolnyi equations with asymptotically at solutions.

introduction. supergravity backgrounds play an important role in the anal-
ysis of string theory. besides genuine fully supersymmetric string vacua, also
particle like solutions with partial supersymmetry (p-branes, monopoles etc.
[6]) are presently obtaining much consideration, in particular in view of their
role in verifying various duality conjectures [8]. however, apart from stringy
monopoles and the related solutions [6] obtained via the heterotic ve-brane
construction [11], most of the literature is devoted to solutions with abelian
gauge elds. this is easily understood, since such congurations can be ob-
tained straightforwardly from the known solutions of the einstein-maxwell
system. on the other hand, it is to be expected that also congurations with
non-abelian gauge elds will eventually play an important role. in addition,
gauged supergravity models have recently regained considerable interest in
view of the ads/cft correspondence [10], which also suggests studying clas-
sical solutions of supergravities with non-abelian gauge elds.

the incompleteness of the abelian picture can be observed already in the (non-
supersymmetric) einstein-yang-mills (eym) theory. a number of interesting
results have been obtained after the discovery in this theory of particle-like
solutions by bartnik and mckinnon [1] (see [12] for a recent review). in view
of the complexity of the eld equations even in the case of static, spherically
symmetric solutions, our knowledge is largely based on numerical analysis.
nevertheless many interesting and partly surprising results are available as
well on globally regular solutions as on black holes with non-abelian hair. in
particular they show that a number of the standard electrovacuum theorems
do not apply in the non-abelian domain:

symmetric solutions.

 the birkho theorem is not valid, i.e. there are time-dependent spherically
 there exist globally regular, asymptotically at static solutions.
 static black holes are not uniquely specied by their mass and their gauge
 static black holes are not necessarily spherically symmetric  israels theo-
 non-rotating stationary black holes are not necessarily static  the abelian

charges  the no hair conjecture is violated.

rems do not apply.

staticity conjecture does not apply.

in view of these results it becomes clear that experience gained in the abelian
domain is not universal, and the non-abelian sector therefore should also be
studied.

we consider in this paper certain particle-like solutions of the coupled einstein-
yang-mills-dilaton (eymd) system. these solutions were obtained numeri-
cally some time ago [9,5,2]. they are static, spherically symmetric, globally
regular, asymptotically at and neutral  with the purely magnetic yang-mills
(ym) eld strength decaying as 1/r3 for r  . in view of their instability

2

and owing to some topological considerations these solutions may be justly
considered as a kind of gravitational sphalerons [12]. there is an innite dis-
crete family of such solutions labeled by the node number n of the gauge eld
amplitude. let us call these solutions eymd solitons. a very special role is
played by the lowest non-trivial  the n = 1  solution. its parameters show
some surprising regularities absent for all the higher (n > 1) solutions, leading
to the hope [9] to nd this solution by analytical methods. one may speculate
that the eld equations in this special case have some hidden symmetry. in
fact, we shall argue in the following that this hidden symmetry is supersymme-
try, although the corresponding supergravity is not the naively expected one
related to heterotic string theory, for which the gauge eld has to be self-dual
in order to have partial supersymmetry [11].

in the recent work [3,4] non-abelian partially supersymmetric solutions were
obtained within the n=4 su(2)su(2) gauged supergravity theory, also known
as freedmanschwarz (fs) model [7]. in the bosonic sector this theory con-
tains the gravitational eld, two non-abelian gauge elds a(1)a
 with
two independent gauge coupling constants g1 and g2, an axion and a dilaton.
one can consistently truncate this theory by requiring that a(2)a
 = 0, while
a(1)a
is purely magnetic, in which case the axion can be set to zero too. as
a result, the bosonic part of the action reduces to the action of the eymd
theory plus a potential term for the dilaton:

(1)

the procedure to nd the solutions applied in [3,4] was to derive the bo-
gomolnyi equations for partially supersymmetric congurations. the corre-
sponding solutions are globally regular (and globally hyperbolic), but not
asymptotically at  due to the presence of the dilaton potential (1).

our strategy to obtain the bogomolnyi equation in the eymd theory is to
supersymmetrize the latter by deriving it from the fs model, which will
allow us to apply the same techniques as in the fs case. accordingly, we need
to get rid of the potential term in eq.(1), and we do this by considering the
fs model for imaginary values of the gauge coupling constant g2:

g2 = i|g2|.

(2)

for |g2| = g1 the potential vanishes, and we recover the eymd theory. the
main point is that, apart from the correct eymd lagrangian, we obtain in
this way, at least formally, also the rules for computing fermionic supersym-
metry variations. setting the latter to zero gives us the equations for the
supersymmetry killing spinors, whose consistency conditions can be formu-
lated as a set of rst order equations for the background elds, and these are

3

compatible with the second order eld equations. the n = 1 eymd soliton
fulls these bogomolnyi equations and possesses two unbroken supersymme-
tries thus showing that our formal procedure makes sense, although to our
disappointment we are still not able to write down the solution in a simple
analytical form.

as a result, we add one more member to the (small) family of known super-
symmetric solutions for gravitating non-abelian gauge elds. as is usual in
this family, the new solution exhibits some surprising features. first, it is quite
bizarre that such a solution arises in a theory without a dilaton potential, the
latter being generically present in all gauged supergravity models. besides,
one can wonder as to whether the solution is supersymmetric at all, since the
imaginary trick employed to obtain it is a rather formal operation. on top
of all, a certain puzzle arises, for if the solution is supersymmetric then one
needs to reconcile this with the fact that it is unstable. the answer to all these
questions we shall oer is that there is in fact a new n=4 gauged supergrav-
ity with gauge group su(2)su(1,1) and vanishing dilaton potential in a 4d
euclidean space.

which is given by eq.(6), while eq.(7) is a consequence of these equations. we
note that the dilatational symmetry (11) now reduces simply to the invariance
under    + , which is due to the autonomy of eqs.(14,15).

existence of an innite sequence of asymptotically at and globally regular

solutions; we call them eymd solitons. they exist in the whole interval
  (,) corresponding to r = e  [0,) and are parameterized by
an integer n = 1, 2, . . . , the number of zeros of the ym-potential w. regular
solutions of eqs.(14-16) have to tend to xed points of these equations for
  . the relevant xed point for solutions with a regular origin is given
by w = 1, w = 0,      = +,  = 1. actually we may use the
symmetry w  w to select w = 1 at r = 0. on the other hand the asymp-
totic behaviour at innity is determined by the xed point w = 1, w = 0,
 = ,  = 1. in both limits one has  = 1.
since these are hyperbolic xed points some further relations between the
otherwise independent functions w and  are required  they have to stay
on the stable manifold of these xed points. near the origin,   , this
implies

w = 1  b e2 + o(e4 ),

     =  + 0 + 2b2e2 + o(e4 ), (17)

with some arbitrary parameters b and 0; one can use the dilatational invari-
ance to set 0 = 0. at innity,   +, one gets

w = (cid:16)1  c e(cid:17) + o(e2 ),

 =  +   me + o(e2 ), (18)

with arbitrary c, , and m. the dilaton charge m in our case coincides with
the adm mass. from the local point of view all the parameters b, , c, and
m are arbitrary, but for globally regular solutions they are xed completely
specifying the node number n.

in general the numerically determined parameters of the globally regular so-
lutions show no particular regularities apart from the n = 1 solution [9]. with

as already pointed out in the introduction, this suggests that there is some
hidden symmetry in the system, for which the n = 1 solution (see fig.1) plays
a special role.

here   i are spinor parameters of the supersymmetry transformations,

su(2)su(2).
thus a bosonic conguration is invariant under supersymmetry transforma-
tions if one can nd non-trivial s such that   =   = 0. setting the
left-hand sides of (22) and (23) to zero, the invariance condition becomes
a system of linear equations for the s. these equations are called super-
symmetry constraints and their solutions are supersymmetry killing spinors.
generically the constraint equations are inconsistent. however, one can ana-
lyze the consistency conditions under which non-trivial solutions for the s
exist. these conditions can be given in the form of a set of nonlinear rst order
dierential equations for the underlying bosonic conguration  usually called
bogomolnyi equations. due to supersymmetry they are automatically com-
patible with the second order equations of motion following from the action
(21).

the supersymmetry constraints in the model (21)(24) were analyzed in [3,4].
it was found that if the boson elds are chosen according to eqs.(4,5) then
non-trivial solutions of the consistency conditions exist, provided that the sec-
ond gauge coupling constant q vanishes. these bogomolnyi equations turned
out to be integrable in closed form. their solution describes a geodesically
complete and globally hyperbolic spacetime with a bps monopole type ym
eld (which is somewhat mysterious since there is no higgs eld) and four
independent supersymmetry killing spinors. however, due to the dilaton po-
tential in (21), this solution is not asymptotically at.

in order to get rid of the potential in the action (21), let us consider the
replacement

q  is

(25)

with real s. obviously, for s = 1 the potential vanishes  the situation we
are aiming at. at the same time, setting in (22) and (23) q = is gives us
non-trivial supersymmetry variations for the fermions. it remains unclear for
the time being whether such an analytic continuation of the supersymmetry
transformations is a legitimate procedure, and whether the resulting transfor-
mations indeed belong to a supersymmetry algebra. however, we temporarily
ignore the problem and go on setting the resulting variations   and   to
zero in order to obtain the supersymmetry constraints. the analysis of the lat-
ter proceeds essentially along the same lines as in the case for real q [4]. one
nds that in the static, spherically symmetric, purely magnetic case, when
the boson elds are chosen according to (4) and (5), the supersymmetry con-
straints with q = is can be made consistent for any real s. the corresponding
consistency conditions are given by the relations

8

d22  2(b  1)2 = d2w2  2s2,
(b + 1)2  a2 = (s  c)2,
(a + b + 1)(d + 2(b  1)) + (s  c)(2s  dw) = 0.

(26)

here the following abbreviations are introduced:

a = 22 e( + 1), b = 2e2(w2  1), c = 4e2w, d = 4e. (27)

under these conditions and for s 6= 0 there exist two independent supersym-
metry killing spinors. for s = 0 the number of supersymmetries doubles,
and eqs.(26) reduce to the bogomolnyi equations studied in [3,4]. with some
labour one can verify that for any s equations (26) are compatible with the
second order eld equations for the action (21). for s 6= 0 one may without
loss of generality assume that s > 0. one can also choose the upper sign in
(26), since the other option is recovered by replacing w  w.
we are interested in the case where s = 1, since then the dilaton potential
vanishes and the theory (21) reduces to our eymd model (3). the supersym-
metry constraints (26) in this case can be expressed in the form

22 = w2 + 1 + e2(w2  1)2,
 =  + (b + 1)
w = 22( + 2) + w2 + 1

w (b  1)

(28)

(29)

(30)

with b from (27). one can verify that these bogomolnyi equations are com-
patible with eqs.(14)(16). studying the power-series solutions to these equa-
tions in the vicinity of the origin and at innity, one immediately recovers the
relations in (19). as a result, all hidden symmetries are now identied and the
last remaining question is whether we can actually solve equations (28)(30).

the bogomolnyi equations. eqs.(28)(30) look rather complicated. how-
ever, remarkable simplications are possible. with the help of eq.(28)  on
the right hand sides of eqs.(29) and (30) can be expressed in terms of 2 and
w2, such that the equations assume the form

,

(31)

where qk() and rk() are k-th order polynomials in  with coecients de-
pending on w. surprisingly, each pair of polynomials in the ratios in (31) turns
out to have a common root thus leading to some cancellations. next, one ex-
presses  in (31) in terms of w2 and 2 and their derivatives, and after this 

9

can be expressed in terms of a new function u via  = (u + w)/2. as a result,
eqs.(28)(30) reduce to

where  and  are now functions of . we note that  =  +  and  is
expressed via u and w by comparing eqs.(28) and (32).

this ode can be transformed to an abel equation of the rst kind, but
unfortunately not of a soluble type. the boundary conditions (17) and (18)
imply that as w varies from one (the origin) to minus one (innity), u(w)
increases from u(1) = 1 to u(1) = 3.

it is worth noting in this connection that   1/ is a symmetry of the
line element (35). we note also that (39) is an abel equation of the rst
kind, but unfortunately again not of any soluble type. for the regular soliton

where the value of the free parameter c should be suitably chosen: c = creg.
comparing (42) with the expansion in eq.(18) one nds creg = 22 (1 
4e2/m 2)  31.15. the numerical analysis conrms that the global solution
w() in the interval   [0,) with such asymptotics exists. this solution is
related to the one for w(r) shown in fig.1 via a nite (position dependent)
rescaling of the argument.

in the generic case the asymptotic solution for large  is given by (42) with
c 6= creg, while the generic regular solution near  = 0 is obtained from (42)
by applying the symmetry transformation (40):

w = 1  22 + 22  223 + 24  b5 + . . . ,

(43)

where b is another free parameter. such solutions lead to a singular four-
geometry.

note that the emergence of the strange prime numbers in the expansion at
the origin in (41) makes it appear unlikely that the analytical solution can be
represented as w() in a simple closed form. the same problem arises if one
tries to look for the solution as w(r), or w(u), etc. the strange prime numbers
appear in general also in the higher order terms in the expansion at innity

in (42). however, for one particular choice, c = 22, all of them cancel, and

one obtains the simple solution

w =

.

(44)

notice that this is invariant under (40). unfortunately, apart from the fact

11

that this is not the solution we are looking for, this solution is unacceptable,
since it leads to e2  0.
to recapitulate, assuming that we nd the solution w  w() of the rst
order bogomolnyi equation (39) with the asymptotic behaviour (41,42), the
full conguration is reconstructed as follows. one computes

u() =

2(1 + w)2 + (1  w)2

(47)

vanishes at the origin. the spacetime metric is given by eq.(35) whereas the
gauge eld is obtained from eq.(5). there are two supersymmetry killing
spinors for this conguration. the solution describes a localized globally reg-
ular object  a supersymmetric gravitational sphaleron. by numerical inte-
gration one nds its mass to be

m  1.4657 ,

(48)

while the value of the dilaton at innity   0.9322.
concluding remarks. employing a simple imaginary trick we were able to
modify the bogomolnyi equations of [3] to cover the case of the eymd theory,
which has no dilaton potential. the deeper reason why this trick works is the
existence of a hitherto unknown euclidean version of the fs model with gauge
group su(2)su(1,1), whose special truncation coincides with the static and
purely magnetic sector of the eymd theory. the details of this new fs model
will be given in a forthcoming publication [13]. in particular it will be shown
that this new n=4 supergravity can be embedded into the standard n=1
supergravity in ten dimensions using the su(2)su(1,1) group manifold as an
internal space. taking the negative of the killing metric of the su(1,1) factor
for the embedding, the contributions to the dilaton potential arising from the
two factors cancel out, while the metric of the 4-space becomes euclidean.

12

when the su(1,1) gauge eld of the new supergravity theory is truncated,
while the su(2) one is purely magnetic and the whole conguration is as-
sumed to be independent of the euclidean time, the bosonic eld equations
reduce to those of the eymd theory in the static and purely magnetic case. at
the same time the fermionic supersymmetry transformations exactly coincide
with those obtained above via the imaginary trick. as a result, the described
above solution of the eymd theory can be viewed as a solution of the new
supergravity model, within which it becomes truly supersymmetric. we note
that there is no paradox with the instability of the solution, since the instabil-
ity occurs within the lorenzian eymd theory, which is not supersymmetric
apart from its static and purely magnetic sector.
