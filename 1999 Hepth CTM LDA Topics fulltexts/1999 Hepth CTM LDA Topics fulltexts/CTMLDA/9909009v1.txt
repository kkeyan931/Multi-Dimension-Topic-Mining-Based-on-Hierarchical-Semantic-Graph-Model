abstract

the quantization of general relativity invariant with respect to time-reparametrizations is
considered. we construct the faddeev-popov generating functional for the unitary perturbation
theory in terms of invariants of the kinemetric group of dieomorphisms of a frame of reference
as a set of einsteins observers with the equivalent hamiltonian description (t = t(t), xi =
xi(t, x1, x2, x3)). the algebra of the kinemetric group has other dimensions than the constraint
algebra in the conventional dirac-faddeev-popov (dfp) approach to quantization.

to restore the reparametrization invariance broken in the dfp approach, the invariant dynamic
evolution parameter is introduced as the zero fourier harmonic of the space metric determinant.
the unconstrained version of the reparametrization invariant gr is obtained. we research the
innite space-time limit of the faddeev-popov generating functional in the theory and discuss
physical consequences of the considered quantization.

introduction

quantization of general relativity (gr) on the level of the unitary [1] perturbation theory [2] was
made by faddeev and popov [3, 4] and by dewitt [5] in accordance with the general hamiltonian
theory for constrained systems formulated by dirac [2, 6] and developed later by many authors (see
e.g. monographs [7, 8, 9]). however, the construction of the unitary s-matrix in an innite space-
time is not enough to answer the questions: what is quantum gravity? and what is quantum
universe with a nite measurable time of its existence and a nite volume of its space? actual
problems of the unication of elementary particle physics with general relativity, cosmology of the
early universe, in particular, the description of quantum processes at the beginning of the universe
require the generalization of these results [4, 5] for a nite space-time.

in the present paper we try to generalize the faddeev-popov-dewitt construction of the unitary
s-matrix for a nite space-time and to answer the above mentioned questions about the quantum
version of gr.

a main problem of generalization of this type is the invariance of gr with respect to the group
of general coordinate transformations. this group includes the kinemetric group of dieomorphisms
of a frame of reference as a set of einsteins observers with the equivalent hamiltonian description of
gr [10]. any hamiltonian description of gr (classical or quantum) should be invariant with respect
to transformations of this dieomorphism group including reparametrizations of the coordinate time.
therefore, the coordinate time should be excluded from the reparametrization invariant hamilto-
nian dynamics. recall, that just the coordinate time is considered as the time of evolution in both
the faddeeev-popov-dewitt unitary s-matrix and the dirac hamiltonian approach to gr [2, 6, 4].
one of constructive ideas for restoration of the reparametrization-invariance of the hamiltonian
dynamics in gr is the introduction of the internal evolution parameter as one of dynamic variables
of the extendend phase space [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. in the present paper, this idea is used
to construct the reparametrization-invariant generalization of the faddeeev-popov-dewitt unitary s-
matrix in gr. we full the invariant hamiltonian quantizing gr with a dynamic evolution parameter
identied with the zero-fourier harmonic of the space-metric determinant [16, 17].

this quantization is considered in the context of the dirac perturbation theory [2] in its simplest

version, without nontrivial topology, black holes, and surface terms in the einstein-hilbert action.

the contents of the paper are the following.

in section 2, we recall the conventional dirac-
faddeev-popov quantization and present the invariant hamiltonian approach to gr corresponding
to the dieomorphism group of the hamiltonian description. section 3 is devoted to the formulation
of the dirac perturbation theory in gr with the invariant description of classical dynamics, in the
reduced phase space, and of the measurable interval. in section 4, we consider the global sector of
the invariant dynamics and dene two dierent standards of measurement of the invariant intervals:
the absolute standard for an einstein observer and the relative standard for a weyl observer who can
measure only a ratio of the lengths of two intervals and who treats gr as a scalar version of the weyl
conformal-invariant theory [17, 19]. section 5 is devoted to the construction of quantum physical states
of the dirac perturbation theory [2]. in section 6, we construct s-matrix for quantum universe and
research the conditions of validity of the conventional quantum eld theory in the innite space-time
limit.

2.1. the dirac-faddeev-popov quantization

to state the problem considered in the present paper, we recall the dirac-faddeev-popov (dfp)
quantized general relativity [2, 3, 4, 20] which is given by the einstein-hilbert action

w gr(g|) =z d4x[g

and by a measurable interval

the hamiltonian description of gr is fullled in the frame of reference with the dirac-adm 3 + 1
parametrization of the metric components [21]

(ds)2

e = g dxdx = n 2dt2  (3)gij dxi dxj

( dxi = dxi + n idt),

and it is given by the rst-order representation of the initial action (1)

according to the dirac general hamiltonian theory [2, 6], the time components of the metric nq, n i
are considered as the lagrange multipliers, and six space components qij, as dynamic variables. four
local einstein equations for the time components of metric

0 := h = 0;

i := pi = 0.

(10)

are treated as the rst class constraints which remove four variables from the extended phase space.
these four constraints should be supplemented by four local gauges which remove their canonical
partners. dirac [2] imposed the gauge constraints

0 :=  := qijij = 0,

k := l(q1/3qlk) = 0

(11)

to express the initial action in terms of two independent dynamic variables of the metric.

the algebra of commutation relations of all constraints forms the faddeev-popov (fp) determi-

nant [3, 4] which restores the unitarity of s-matrix in quantum theory.

are the space and time parts of the fp determinant. this functional and its gauge-equivalent versions
are the foundation of the quantum eld theory approach to general relativity in the framework of
the perturbation theory formulated in the innite space-time limit.

2.2. dieomorphism group of the hamiltonian description

to extract any physical information from relativistic systems, one should point out a frame of refer-
ence [10]. the latter means to answer the questions: which quantities can an observer measure? how
do these quantities connect with the metric components? how do results of measurements depend on
a state of motion of an observer? the simplest example is the description of the energy spectrum of
a relativistic particle in special relativity (sr) with the poincare group of symmetry. there are two
distinguished frames of the hamiltonian description: the rest frame of an observer, and the comoving
frame. in both the cases, to solve the physical problem and to obtain the spectrum, it is sucient to
restrict sr by only the subgroup of the poincare group which exludes the pure lorentz transforma-
tions. the latter are needed to answer the last question: how does the spectrum in the rest frame
connect with the one in the comoving frame?

the main assertion of the present paper is the following: for the hamiltonian description of gr
in a denite frame of reference, it is sucient to restrict gr by the group of dieomorphisms of this
frame.

recall that the hamiltonian formulation (5) is based on the possibility to introduce a set of
the three-dimensional space-like hyperspaces (4) numerated by the time-like coordinate in the four-
dimensional manifold of the world events. this set can be dened within transformations of a kine-
metric subgroup of the group of general coordinate transformations (3) [10, 16, 17, 18]

t  t = t(t);

xi  x

i = x

i(t, x1, x2, x3),

(19)

which includes one global function (the time reparametrizations t(t)) and three local ones (x
i(t, x)).
this is the group of dieomorphisms of a set of einsteins observers with the equivalent hamiltonian

4

dynamics
(5). this continuum of observers with the dieomorphism group (19) is called the
kinemetric frame of reference [10]. action (5) can be written in terms of the dieomorphism invariants

w e(g|) =

t2zt1

dtz d3x[ijdtqij  nqh],

including invariant dierentials

dtdtqij = dt[ qij + qikkn j + qjkkn i  2qijkn k].

(20)

(21)

the dimensions of dieomorphism group (19) do not coincide with the dimensions of the dirac-
faddeev-popov (dfp) algebra of constraints.

it is easy to see that, in the case of a nite time interval (t1 < t < t2), the dfp generating
functional (15) breaks the invariance with respect to the global reparametrization of the coordinate
time (19).

on the other hand, a local transformation of the coordinate time t = t(t, x) goes beyond the

scope of this group (19).

thus, the generating functional

(15) takes into account the symmetry which is absent in the

dieomorphism group (19) and it breaks the symmetry contained in this group.

below we show that three gauges (11) k = 0 are sucient to remove all local ambiguities from
the hamiltonian dynamics, so that the fourth local gauge can contradict the hamiltonian equations
of motion. only the space integral from the equation for the lapse-function could be considered as the
standard rst class constraint (accompanied by the second class one, i.e. gauge) in agreement with
the dieomorphism group of the hamiltonian description (19).

2.3. the invariant hamiltonian scheme

to restore the time-reparametrization invariance, we introduce the internal evolution parameter as the
zero fourier harmonic 0(t) of the space metric determinant logarithm [16]. this evolution parameter
can be extracted by the conformal-type transformation of the metric

g(t, x) = (

0(t)



)2g(t, x).

(22)

the local part of momentum of the space metric determinant  and its motion equation equivalent k

(t, x) := qij ij,

k(t, x) :=

qijdt qij

nq

=

dt log q

nq

are given in the class of functions with the non-zero fourier harmonics, so that

z d3x(t, x) = 0,

z d3xk(t, x) = 0.

(23)

(24)

using the transformational properties of the curvature r(g) with respect to the transformation (22)
it is easy to obtain the action (1) in the form

w e(g|) = w e(g|0) 

t2zt1

dt0

d

( 0v )

(v =z d3x n 1

),

(25)

with the same number of variables. the hamiltonian form of this action is

w e(q|) =

t2zt1

dt z d3x[ij qij  nq h  n i pi]  0p0 +

p 2
0

4v! ,

(26)

where the densities of the local excitations pi and h repeat the conventional einstein ones (8) and (7)
where the planck constant  is replaced by the internal evolution parameter 0 and q,  are replaced
by q, 

p = p(q,   q, );

h = h(q,   q, ;   0).

(27)

we shall consider action (26) as one of the kinemetric invariant versions of the hamiltonian dynam-
ics with the global variables which allow us to extract the time-reparamerization invariant physical
consequences in accordance with the dieomorphism group (19).

2.4. unconstrained form of gr

the unconstrained form of gr is obtained by explicit resolving the constraints. the space constraints

w e
n k = 0  pk = 0

(28)

and the dieomorphism group (19) allow us to remove from the extended phase space three local
components of the graviton eld by xing the gauge (11)

k = i(q1/3 qik) = 0.

(29)

constraints (28), and (29) can be explicitly solved by the decomposition of momenta ij into the
transverse part t

ij and longitudinal components fk

ij = t

ij + q1/3[ifj + jfi 

2
3

qij qlklfk]

( i[q1/3 t

ij] = 0 ).

(30)

substitution of this decomposition into constraint (28) leads to the equation for the longitudinal
component fk

pi(, q) = pi(, q) 

i fk = 0  bk

i fk =

pi(t , q)

in the class of local functions with the non-zero fourier harmonics where the reverse operator (b1)i

as the functional of all other variables. it is the generator of evolution with respect to the dynamic
evolution parameter 0. thus, the global part of equation (32) removes the global momentum p0, in

this factor represents the lagrange multiplier. the generator of the dynamic evolution (33)

nq(t, x) = [q h(t, x)]1(t).
h r = 2v h = 2z d3xq h(t, x)

(35)

(36)

does not depend on this factor (t).

in accordance with the dieomorphism group (19), we consider as constraint only equation (33)

which is the equation for the lagrange multiplier (t).

the global constraint (33) has two solutions which correspond to two reduced systems with the

actions

following to dirac [6], we call the sector of the reduced phase space described by action (37) the
dirac observables. these variables are kinemetric invariants by the construction. the equations of

solutions of equations (38), (39) determine the dependence of the dirac observables with on the
dynamic evolution parameter .

the main problem is to construct the time-reparametrization invariant faddeev- popov generating

functional for the unitary perturbation theory.

3. the invariant version of the dirac perturbation theory

the reparametrization-invariant version of the perturbation theory begins from the nonperturbative
background metric with the homogeneous part of the space metric (22) (which gives the dynamic
evolution parameter) and the global component of the lapse function n0 (35) which denes the
reparametrization-invariant conformal time

nq = n0 n;

dt = n0(t)dt

(dt  = n 

0dt = dt ).

(40)

7

for the local part of metric, we use the version of the dirac perturbation theory [2]

q1/3 qij = ij + ht
ij;

q1/3 = 1 + 4z + ...;

n = 1 +  + ....

(41)

asymptotic states will be considered in the neglect of interactions, in accordance with the standard
suppositions of quantum eld theory.

in the lowest order of this theory equation (34) determines z = (log q)/12

22
3



z = h0  0

( 0 = r d3x h0

v0

;

v0 =z d3x ) .

(42)

a solution of this equation recalls the fp gauge [4] where the internal evolution parameter is changed
by  and instead of the massive matter we have the non-zero fourier harmonic part of the hamiltonian
for two transverse and trace-less gravitons

h0 :=

6
2 (t )2

ij +

2
24

(k(ht )ij)2 := 2 hk + 2 hr.

(43)

the solutions of equation (42) is usually treated as the newton interaction of particles, i.e. of the
transverse and trace-less gravitons ht
ij which form the asymptotical physical states, similar to photons
in qed. these transverse gravitons ht
[18] in context of the invariant
hamiltonian quantization. the trace component of the graviton momentum qij ij = pz/12 disappears
from the kinetic part of the hamiltonian (43) hk as a result of the solution of the space constraints.
nevertheless, the momentum pz is not equal to zero as it follows from the equations of the initial
extended system for pz

ij are considered in paper

and for n k = n k/n0

22(z  k nk) = pz

(z =

z
t

= 0z),

22
3



(kz   nk) = p t

k := (t )ijk(ht )ij,

(44)

(45)

in contrast with the dirac gauge [2]. the perturbation part of the lapse function  is determined from
the motion equation of the reduced system for z unambiguously

 =

22
3

z1
0

.

(46)

one can see that the range of applicability of the dirac perturbation theory (41) is the region where
derivatives are far less than the internal evolution parameter f /f << 2.

in the opposite limit 0  0, we got the local version of the model of an anisotropic universe

considered by misner [22].

4. measurable quantities

4.1. geometry

the dynamic sector of the unconstrained gr restricted by the dirac observables (37), (38), (39) is
not sucient to determine evolution of the einstein invariant interval

(dse)2 = (




)2 q1/6(dsc)2,

8

(47)

here dsc is the conformal invariant interval

(dsc)2 = q1/3[dt 2 n 2  qij dxi dxj];

( dxj = dxj + n jdt )

(48)

which does not depend on the global variable . these intervals characterize the measurable geometry
of the space-time and contain the shift vector n k and invariant time parameter (40). the latter is
well-known in the classical friedmann cosmology [14, 17] as the conformal time connected with the
world friedmann time by the relation

dtf =

(t )



dt.

(49)

measurable geometrical quantities go out from the set of the dirac observables, and can be deter-
mined by invariant equations of the initial extended system for the global variables p0,  and the local
ones jl which are omitted by the reduced action (37). in particular, the evolution of the universe is
not also included in the dynamic sector of the dirac observables.

4.2. evolution of a universe

the evolution of a universe is the dependence of the measurable time (40) on the internal evolution
parameter given by the equation of the extended system

(51)

is well-known as the friedmann-hubble law in the friedmann-robertson-walker cosmology.
it is
natural to call the hamiltonian h the measurable one, as it determines the evolution of the dirac
observables with respect to the measurable time t

4.3. standards of measurement

as it was shown in papers [16, 17], gr with the einstein-hibert action can be also treated as the
scalar version of the weyl conformal theory [19] with the scalar eld w considered as the measure of
a change of the length of a vector in its parallel transport. in this case the role of the metric scale eld
g = q1/12 in gr is played by the lichnerowich [23, 11] conformal invariant variable c = wq1/12
of the scalar eld. dynamics of both the einstein gr and the weyl theory is the same (including
the matter sector where the scalar eld forms masses of fermion and boson elds), but not standards
of measurement. an einstein observer measures the absolute lengths (ds)e, while a weyl observer
can measure only the ratio of lengths of two vectors (ds)w = (ds1)e/(ds2)e = (ds1)c/(ds2)c which is
conformal-invariant. thus, a classical state of the universe in gr (with the einstein-hilbert action)
is determined both by the dynamic sector of the dirac observables in the reduced phase space and
the geometrical sector of measurables; the latter are determined not only by invariant dynamics of
the einstein-hilbert action , but also by standards of measurements.

the same gr dynamics corresponds to dierent cosmological pictures for dierent observers:
an einstein observer, who supposes that he measures an absolute interval, obtains the friedmann-
robertson-walker (frw) cosmology where the red shift is treated as expansion of the universe; a weyl
observer, who supposes that he measures a relative interval dc, obtains the hoyle-narlikar cosmology
[24]. the red shift and the hubble law in the hoyle-narlikar cosmology [24]

equation (56) gives the relation between the present-day value of the scalar eld and cosmological

observations (the density of matter and the hubble parameter)

(t ) = p(t )

.

note that the present-day observational data [27] on the matter density

(58)

planck mass)

0(t0) = 1/2

0

.

(59)

both the standards of measurement of the present day value of 0 in observational cosmology give
the value of the planck mass (59). nevertheless, only for the relative standard of a weyl observer,
local measurements of the invariant interval do not depend on the parameters of global evolution of
the universe.

5. measurable quantum universe

(61)

as we have seen above, the description of both the dirac dynamics (in the reduced phase space) and
the measurable geometry, i.e. the invariant interval

is the measurable hamiltonian of free gravitons. this action includes the world time interval

the dependence of the world time on the internal evolution parameter  is treated as evolution
of a classical universe. quantization of the extended constrained system with the free gravitons
(63) was performed in paper [18] where the holomorphic variables of particles (a+, a) were dened
as variables which diagonalize the measurable hamiltonian (64), and quasiparticles (b+, b), as
variables which diagonalize the classical and quantum equations of motion and lead to the equivalent
oscillator-like system with the set of conserved quantum numbers. for the latter system there is
the canonical transformation [25, 26, 18] of the extended system (63) to a new set of variables

so that the new internal evolution parameter  coincides, in the equation of motion for the new
momentum , with the invariant time measured by a weyl observer in the comoving frame of references

the rst term corresponds to the rigid state equation (in accordance with the classication of the
standard cosmology) and it leads to the kasner anisotropic stage t()  2 (described by the
misner wave function [22]). from the point of view of elds of matter for which  forms masses,
the negative solution 2(t) < 0 (anti-universe) is not stable, in this stage. the second term of the
squeezed vacuum density (68) leads to the stage with the ination of the scale  with respect to the
time measured by a weyl observer

it is the stage of intensive creation of measurable particles. after the ination, the hubble parameter
goes to zero, and gravitons convert into photon-like oscillator excitations with the conserved number
of particles.

at the present-day stage, we can describe in- and out -states in terms of the measurable time t
and the hamiltonian h0 (64) where  is changed by , in agreement with the data of the observational
cosmology (t0) =  discussed above.

it is natural to suppose that eout is a tremendous energy in comparison with possible deviations of
the free hamiltonian in the laboratory processes

innite volume limit of quantum gravity

we consider the innite volume limit of the s-matrix element in terms of the measurable time t for
the present-day stage t = t0 taking into account only the contribution of the universe + = 1,  = 0

(71)

one can express this matrix element in terms of the time measured by an observer of an out-state
with the tremendous number of particles in the universe using equation (69) and the approximation
(70).

in the innite volume limit, we get

d[h r

i ] = dt [ f hi + o(1/v0) + o(1/eout)]

(72)

12

where hi is the hamiltonian of interaction in gr, and

f =s eout

eout +  h0

(73)

is the multiplier which plays the role of a form factor for physical processes observed at the laboratory
conditions when the cosmic energy eout is much greater than the deviation of the free energy

 h0 = h0  eout;

(74)

due to creation and annihilation of real and virtual particles in the laboratory experiments. the
measurable time of the laboratory experiments t2  t1 is much smaller than the age of the universe
t0, but it is much greater than the reverse laboratory energy , so that the limit

is valid. we can get the conventional quantum eld theory representation of matrix element (71)

if we neglect the form factor (73) which removes a set of ultraviolet divergences. this matrix element
corresponds to the fp functional integral

where w e[q|] is the initial action (1) in terms of the conformal-invariant time t for n = 1 (40).
the main dierence of the obtained generating functional from the faddeev-popov-dewitt one
[4, 5] is the absence of the fourth gauge which xes the determinant of the space metric [4] or its
momentum [2]. in both the cases, these gauges contradict the motion equations for these variables,
as we have seen above, in the context of the dirac perturbation theory [2].

the result (76) could be predicted from the very beginning, the problem was to show the range of
validity of the conventional quantum eld perturbation theory [3, 4] and its possibilities for solution
of problems of the early universe.

the relativistic covariance of the considered scheme of quantization can be proved in the innite
space-time on the level of algebra of commutation relations of the generators of the poincare symmetry
in perturbation theory by analogy with qed [28].

from the point of view of the quantum eld theory limit, the conformal variables and measurable
quantities, including the conformal time, are favorable, and the einstein general relativity looks
like a scalar version of the weyl conformal invariant theory, where the weyl scalar eld forms both
the planck mass (in agreement with the present-day astrophysical data) and masses of elementary
particles [17] (in agreement with the principle of equivalence).

in the weyl theory, the higgs mechanism of the formation of particle masses becomes superuous
and, moreover, it contradicts the equivalence principle, as, in this case, the planck mass and masses
of particles are formed by dierent scalar elds.

in the conformal theory [16, 17], we got the -version of the standard model [19] without higgs
particles, and with the prescription (73) to be free from the ultra-violet divergences for the precision
calculations.

7. conclusion

we have obtained the generalization of the unitary s-matrix in general relativity [5, 4, 20] for
a nite space-time in agreement with the group of invariance of the hamiltonian dynamics in gr.
this group contains reparametrizations of the coordinate time (t) and gauge transformations with
three local parameters. we have shown that the solution of one global constraint (with respect to
the zero fourier harmonic of the space metric determinant 0) and three local constraints remove all
ambiguities from the perturbation theory for transverse gravitons, so that the fourth gauge [2, 4] for
xation of the space metric determinant is superuous and can contradict equations of motion.

as a result of the solution of these constraints, we got the unconstrained version of gr which
describes the dynamics of the dirac observables in the reduced phase space with the dynamic
evolution parameter. besides the unconsrained dynamics, the extended hamiltonian gr contains the
geometry of measurable quantities (which depend on all components of metric including those which
cannot be dened by complete set of equations in the sector of the dirac observables).

the geometric sector of measurable intervals is a specic feature of gr which strongly distin-
guishes it from classical unconstrained systems where the dynamic evolution parameter coincides with
the measurable time.

in particular, the evolution of the universe is the evolution of the dirac sector of observables
(together with their dynamic evolution parameter) with respect to the measurable interval (including
the invariant proper time), and this measurable evolution goes beyond the scope of the sector of
the dirac observables. this fact is the main diculty for the standard quantization.

to emphasize the autonomy of the measurable geometrical sector in gr, we pointed out two
dierent standards of measurement (relative and absolute) which correspond to two theories with
the same dynamics: gr and the scalar version of the weyl geometry of similarity (with a scalar
eld as the measure of a change of the length of a vector in its parallel transport). in terms of the
conformal invariant variables, actions of both these theories coincide, but the measurable intervals are
dierent. an einstein observer (who measures lengths by the absolute standard) sees the friedmann-
robertson-walker evolution of a universe, while a weyl observer (who treats the determinant of the
three-dimensional metric multiplied by the planck constant as a measure of a change of the length of
a vector in its parallel transport) sees the hoyle-narlikar evolution.

we have considered the phenomenon of quantum universe mainly with a view to its measurement

describing the methods of measurement and dening the standards on which they depend [29].

the phenomenon of quantum universe can be described by two measurable quantities: the time
in the comoving frame, and the red shift of spectral lines of the cosmic object atoms in terms of the
dynamic evolution parameter (i.e. the scale factor). both these quantities determine the background
metric of the considered perturbation theory for the unconstrained gr and measurable density.

now, we can dene the quantum universe as the universe lled by free quantum elds in the
space-time with the considered background metric and standard of the measurement of the invari-
ant time intervals. the evolution of the quantum universe is expressed in terms of the measurable
time by canonical transformations which convert the dynamic evolution parameter into the measur-
able time and the variables of particles (diagonalizing the measurable density) into the quasiparticles
(diagonalizing equations of motion) with the squeezed vacuum.

the quantum gravity is the theory of s-matrix between the states of the quantum universe.
the innite space-time limit of this s-matrix leads to the standard quantum eld theory s-matrix
provided the measurable time is the conformal time of a weyl observer and general relativity is the
scalar version of the weyl conformal invariant theory with the set of prediction, including

the hoyle-narlikar version of observational cosmology, where the physical reason of red-shift is

changing masses of elementary particles in the process of evolution of the universe,

14

the cosmic mechanism of the formation of both the masses of elementary particles and the planck

mass by the weyl scalar eld (which does not contradict the present-day astrophysical data),

the squeezed vacuum ination from nothing at the beginning of the universe,
and the negative result of cern experiment on the search of higgs particles.
