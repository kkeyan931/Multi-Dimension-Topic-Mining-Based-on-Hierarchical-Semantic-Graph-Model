abstract

the soliton time-delays and the semiclassical limit for soliton s-matrices are calculated
for non-simply laced ane toda field theories. the phase shift is written as a sum over
bilinears on the soliton conserved charges. the results apply to any two solitons of any ane
toda field theory. as a by-product, a general expression for the number of bound states
and the values of the coupling in which the s-matrix can be diagonal are obtained. in order
to arrive at these results, a vertex operator is constructed, in the principal gradation, for
non-simply laced ane lie algebras, extending the previous constructions for simply laced
and twisted ane lie algebras.

introduction.

in 1+1 dimensions, a well known class of integrable theories are the ane toda field theories

(atfts). for each ane lie algebra bg, we can associate an atft. for simplicity, it will be

considered just the untwisted algebras2. if the coupling  is imaginary, there exist degenerate
vacua and solitons interpolating these vacua. an n -soliton solution can be written as [1]

ej  =

< j|g(t)|j >
< 0|g(t)|0 >mj

with

g(t) =

nyk=1

eqi(k)wi(k)bf i(k)() ,

wi(k)(x, t) = ei(k) cosh k(xvkt) ,
ki(k) cosh k ,

qi(k) = eik ex0

where k is the rapidity of the kth soliton, x0
k its position at t = 0, k is a phase and i(k)is the
mass particle of species i(k). let g be the underlying lie algebra. for each dot of the dynkin
diagram of g, it can be associated a soliton species. each species may have various dierent

species with two topological charges: the well known soliton and anti-soliton solutions. the mass
for each species is[1]

where 0 is the negative of the hightest root. written in this form, it becomes clear that <
j|g(t)|j > are the  -functions which appear in the hirota method, used in[7]-[9].
quite a lot of work has been done in order to obtain the s-matrix for the particles[18]-[17]
and for the solitons[18]-[22] of atft. as usual, the proposed s-matrix must be constructed in
agreement with the s-matrix axioms. however, in order to conrm that the proposed s-matrix is
associated to a given theory, one must check if it has the correct semiclassical limit.

it was proven for simply laced[2][3] and for twisted[4] ane lie algebras, that the highest

non-vanishing power of bf i() has a vertex operator construction. from this construction, it

was shown[5] that given any soliton, after having collisions with other solitons, it regains its
original shape, as expected by a soliton solution, and the only eect being a time-delay which was
calculated. from the time-delay, it was obtained[5] the semiclassical limit for the transmission
amplitude of the simply laced soliton s-matrix.

in the present paper, these results are extended for the remaining case of non-simply laced
ane lie algebras obtaining a semiclassical expression which holds for any ane lie algebra.
in section 2, after a brief review, it is shown that also for the
the paper is divided as follows:

non-simply laced case the last non-vanishing power of bf i() has a vertex construction. then, the

asymptotic behavior of the solitons is analyzed in section 3 and the time-delay resulting from the
collision of two or more solitons is calculated in section 4. from the time-delay is calculated, in
section 5, the semiclassical limit of the soliton s-matrix which holds for any atft. the phase shift
is written in terms of the soliton conserved charges. in section 6 is obtained a general expression
for the number of bound states in the direct and cross channel of the s-matrix and the values of
the coupling in which the s-matrix can be purely elastic. our conclusions are stated in section 7.

2 vertex operator construction for non-simply laced ane

lie algebras.

in order to deal with soliton solitons in atft, it is convenient to consider an alternative basis for

an ane lie algebrabg (for simplicity, let us considerbg untwisted) with generators bem , m being
an exponent ofbg(i.e m = mh +  where  are exponents of g and m  z) , bf i

level x. using the conventions of [1]-[5], they satisfy the commutation relations

n , n  z and the

the generators which ad-diagonalize the principal heisenberg subalgebra are

m+n .

let us now prove that also for non-simply laced ane lie algebras, the highest non-vanishing

power of bf i(z) admits a vertex operator construction. as is well known [6], all non-simply laced

lie algebras can be obtained from a simply-laced lie algebra g as a xed subalgebra g under
an outer automorphism  of g. the dynkin diagram of g , (g ), is obtained by identifying the
vertices on each separate orbit of  . the set of vertices in the orbit containing the vertex i will
be denoted by < i > and pi stands for the number of vertices. denoting by i and i, the simple
roots and fundamental weights of g, the g simple roots are[23]

and the g fundamental coweights

have the correct inner products with the simple roots. from (15), it follows that

(15)

(16)

(17)

turning to the ane lie algebras, one can once obtain all the non-simply laced bg as xed
subalgebras of simply-lacedbg by an outer automorphism b . one can note that the exponents of
bg are a subset of the exponents ofbg and it was proven[2] that for this subset of exponents,

(18)

it was also shown that

b (bem ) = bem .
n ) = bf  (i)
b (bf i
therefore, the generators ofbg which belong to the xed subalgebrabg are
bem
if m is an exponent of bg
:=pi<i> bf i

from (18), (19) and (10) it follows that

bf <i>

(20)

 (i)  q([m ]) = i  q([m ]) .

using this relation, (15) and the fact that all the roots in the orbit < i > the have same color, it
follows that for the generators (20),

m+n .

hbem ,bf <i>

n i = <i>  q([m ])bf <i>
bf <i>(z) := xi<i>bf i(z)

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

(26)

(27)

then,

where

m (j) = ... .

it follows that in the <j> representation,

as it has been explained in [4], under a folding procedure, the inequivalent fundamental repre-

hbem , bf <i>(z)i = <i>  q([m ])zmbf <i>(z) .

are inbg and
for bem  bg .
sentations ofbg with highest weights j ,  (j) ,  2(j) , ... become identied as a single fundamen-
tal representation of bg whose highest weight is denoted by <j> and with level m<j> = mj =
recall that as bg is simply laced, in the bg representation with highest weight j, the highest
non-vanishing power of bf i(z) has the vertex operator construction (11). this remains true in the
<j> representation ofbg as does (f i(z))m<j>+1 = 0. since[2]
hbf i(z),bf  (i)(z)i = 0 ,
(cid:16)bf <i>(z)(cid:17)pim<j>+1
bv <i>(z)  (cid:16)bf <i>(z)(cid:17)pim<j>
= yi<i>
bv <i>(z) = (b<i>)mj e2iv
 = exp xm>0
b<i> = y0p<qpi

but each factor in the above product can be written as a vertex operator. performing the normal
ordering (13), using (16) and (17), it follows that

(cid:16)bf i(z)(cid:17)m<j>

= 0 ,

see that this indeed happens. for the cases in which  is of order two and m is not a degenerate

the sum in (28) runs over the positive exponents ofbg. however, in order for the vertex operator
to make sense in the non-simply laced algebra bg , the sum must be over its exponents. let us
exponent,b (bem ) = bem [2], and therefore

i  q([m ]) =  (i)  q([m ]) .

this implies that v
obtained by explicit computation for the order three automorphism of d(1)
exponents of d(1)

<i>.q([m ]) will vanish if bem does not belong to bg . the same result can be

4 and for the degenerate
2n , by using the fact that i  q([m ]) are proportional to the components of the

(30)

4

eigenvectors of the cartan matrix, which are well known. therefore, the above vertex operator

exponents.

with the above result, we conclude that for any ane lie algebra, in a level mj representation,

construction makes sense in the non-simply laced algebra bg , since the sum is restricted to its
the highest non-vanishing power of bf i(z) has a vertex operator given by (27), with pi = 1 and

using the denition (26), it is straightforward to check that, in the <j> representation,

bi = 1 for the simply laced and twisted algebras.

hbem ,bv <i>(z)i = m<j>v

<i>  q([m ])zmbv <i>(z) .

(31)

and the vertex operator (27) indeed satises this commutation relation. it is interesting to note

that bem /m<j> and bv <i>(z) satisfy the same commutation relation as bem and bf <i>(z) satisfy
for the dual algebra (bg )v.

using (6), the normal ordering of two vertex operators can be performed, in the <j> repre-

sentation, which gives

where

bv <i>(zi)bv <k>(zk) = x<i><k>(zi, zk)m<j> : bv <i>(zi)bv <k>(zk) :

x<i><k>(zi, zk) = exp xn >0

(33)

similarly to the simply laced case[2], (33) can be also written as

x<i><k>(zi, zk) =

hyp=1(cid:18)1  p zk

zi(cid:19)p(cid:0)v

<i>(cid:1)v

.

(34)

where  = exp(2i/h). moreover, from the commutation relation (24) we nd that

y <i>

bf <k>(zk)y <i>

 (zi) = y <i>

+ (zi)x 1/pk

<i><k>(zi, zk)
<k><i>(zk, zi)

which will be very useful in the next sections. using the fact that

 (zi)bf <k>(zk)x 1/pk
hxp=1

pv

k = 0

(35)

(36)

and

ppk = h (k + r(g)) ,

hxp=1

we nd that x<i><k>has the symmetry property

x<i><k>(zi, zk)1/pk = x<k><i>(zk, zi)1/pk

it is very important to note that all results in this section hold also for simply laced algebras,
just remembering that for these algebras the coroots (coweights) coincide with the roots(weights)
and that the pis are one. for notational simplicity, from now on the brackets < ... > will no
longer be used.

3 asymptotic behavior of soliton solutions.

having obtained the vertex operator, the asymptotic behavior of the soliton solutions (1) can be
checked. in order that the one-soliton solution be able to be put at rest, the variable zk must take
the form[1]

(37)
where k is the rapidity of the kth soliton and c(k) is the color associated to the k dot of the
dinkin diagram. then, xik can be expressed as a function of ik  i  k:

zk = iek ei (1+c(k))

2h

xik(ik) =

hyp=1(cid:16)eik  e

i

2h (4p+c(i)c(k))(cid:17)pv

now, since bem|j >= 0 for m > 0, the expectation value for the vertex operator is
then, the one-soliton solution created by the group element3 g(t) = exp(aibf i()), ai  qiwi,

< j|bv i(z)|j >= bmj

i e2iv

will take the form

i j (ai)mj pi

i j .

i e2iv

(38)

ej  =

1 +  + bmj

(39)

,

[1 +  + bi (ai)pi ]mj

where the dots indicate intermediate powers of ai. these intermediate powers, whose coecients
we have not calculated, do not aect the asymptotic limits x  + or x  , which are
equivalent to ai   or ai  0, respectively. thus:

ej  =(cid:26) e2ij v

i

x  
x  

in particular, this shows that, asymptotically,  does approach one of the degenerate vacua. we

can also conclude that the topological charge for the soliton created by bf i() will satisfy

2i

i + r(gv

qtop  (+)  () =

 (cid:0)v

 )(cid:1) .

using the normal ordering (32), we obtain that the two-soliton solution created by g(t) = exp aibf i(zi)

with the asymptotic limits exp [2i(v

solution interpolates degenerate vacua, and the with topological charge satisfying

this argument is readily extended to more solitons.

4 soliton time-delays for non-simply laced atft.

in [5], the time-delay or lateral displacement of the soliton trajectories arising from collisions
has been obtained for simply laced atft. now, we are in position to extend this result to the
non-simply laced atft.

3 no sum is assumed for the repeated indices.

6

consider a solution (1) with two solitons created by the group element

g(t) = eai(2)(2)bf i(2)(2)eai(1)(1)bf i(1)(1)

where we consider that 1 > 2. in order to obtain the time-delay, we shall be tracking each soliton
in time. by tracking a soliton i we mean remain in its vicinity, which is near x = x0
i + vit.
following this tracking procedure for soliton 1, which is described in detail in section 4 of [5], and
using (35), (36) , it follows that in the past t  , in the vicinity of soliton 1,

(40)

(41)

(42)

ej  

< j|eai(1)bf i(1)(1)|j >
< 0|eai(1)bf i(1)(1)|0 >mj

which corresponds to a one-soliton solution of species i(1), velocity v1, initial position x0
phase 1. on the other hand, in the future t  , in the vicinity of soliton 1,

1 and

ej   e2iv

i(2) j < j|ex
< 0|ex

1/pi(1)

1/pi(1)
i(1)i(2)

i(1)i(2) (12)ai(1)bf i(1)(1)|j >
(12)ai(1)bf i(1)(1)|0 >mj

again, we recognize once more a single soliton of species i(1), velocity v1 and phase 1. however,
the factor x
1 (see
(4)). the eect is

1/pi(1)
i(1)i(2), which is real and positive, changes the modulus of ai(1) and hence x0

i(1) cosh(cid:0)x  x0

1  v1t(cid:1) +

1

pi(1)

ln xi(1)i(1)(12) .

(43)

so, soliton 1 regains its original shape after the collision, and the only eect of the collision is
that solution (41) diers from (42) by a translation in space-time. more precisely, the lateral
displacement of soliton 1, due to its collision with soliton 2, 12x, satises

e112x = 

mi(1)

pi(1)i(1)

ln xi(1)i(2)(12) = 

2h
|2|

ln xi(1)i(2)(12) ,

(44)

where e1 = mi(1) cosh 1 is the energy of soliton 1 and (15) has been used as well as the mass
formula (5). the time delay 12t of soliton 1 with momentum p1, is obtained from

following [5], one can repeat the procedure by tracking the slower soliton 2, from which it

p112t = e112x .

follows that

e221x =

2h
|2|

ln xi(1)i(2)(12) = e112x ,

(45)

as expected, where 21x is the lateral displacement of soliton 2 due to its collision with soliton 1.
therefore, we can combine both results as

piikt = sign(i  k)

ln xik(ik) .

2h
|2|

(46)

it is not dicult to extend this procedure from the collision of two solitons to the collision of

any number of solitons. like [5], it results for the mthsoliton that

emmx =

ln xi(m)i(k)(mk)  xvk<vm

where mx is the total spatial displacement for the mth soliton. the left summation are the the
contributions form the solitons faster than m and the right summation are the contributions from
the slower solitons.

5 semiclassical limit for the soliton s-matrix.

in 1+1 dimensions, the leading term, in semiclassical approximation, of the 2-states transmission
s-matrix elements, can be obtained from the time-delays, as was shown in [24]. they proved that
for a collision of states  and  with total energy e in the centre of momentum frame, that the
transmission s-matrix element has the form

with

s = exp(cid:18) i

rewriting this derivative in terms of the relative rapidity,   |  | yields

consider the collision of two solitons of species i and k with respective topological charges

a and b. putting (46) in the last equation, one gets

ia,kb() = ia,kb(0) +

(48)

note that since the time-delay does not depend on the soliton topological charges, then only the
integration constant ia,kb(0) may depend on them.

conserved charges of atfts.
indeed, as pointed out in [11][27], the phase shift of any purely
elastic exact s-matrix for an integrable theory could be written as a sum over bilinears on the
conserved charges. in the next section, the values of the coupling in which the soliton s-matrix
can be purely elastic are obtained. so for these values of the coupling, one could expect that an
expression like this for the phase shift to be exact, with p n
i being the quantum conserved charges
and doing the substitution (59), given in the next section. for example, for sine-gordon, the
integral representation of exact phase shift of the soliton-soliton transmission amplitude[18] is

(52) (or (56) ), with the rst term of the series expansion of the cotangent given the semiclassical
term. from this expression of the phase shift one gets for free the sine gordon soliton quantum
charges.

it is interesting to note that the atft particle s-matrix, which is purely elastic for any value
of coupling, has a phase shift [17] similar to (56) but with the conserved charges being proportional
to the right eingenvector y()
. therefore, for the values of the coupling in which the

from the above expression for the phase shift, it follows that

ia,kb(0) + ia,kb(0)  ia,kb()  ia,kb() =

v

42
|2|

i (cid:16)v
 nik(2)h

k + v

k(cid:17)

(58)

where kb means the antisoliton of the soliton of species k and topological charge b. following
the super-levinson theorem [24], the largest integer smaller than nik(2) gives the number of
bound states in both, the direct and the cross channels. note that for sine-gordon (g = a(1)
)
1 = 1/2 and we recover the well known result7 that the number of bound states is the largest
1
integer smaller than n11 = 4/h|2|, in the semiclassical approximation. in order to obtain the
exact result, one should replace[28] h|2|/4 by  given in (57). in view of the arguments in [30],
one would expect that a similar substitution

h|2|
4   

4 (cid:20) h
h|2|

hv 

4 (cid:21)1
h|2|

,

(59)

in (58) would give the exact number of bound states.

these bound states should correspond to poles in the exact s-matrix associated not just to
breathers but also for the fusing of soliton solutions, which appear as poles of xik() [5] and
are governed by doreys fusing rule[13]. some of the bound states were analysed[21] for some
particular algebras and particular colliding soliton species.

by direct inspection, one can conclude that

v

k

= v

k + r(g ) .

(60)

this result is due to the fact that[3]

v

k

= 0(v
k )

where 0 is the very special element of the weyl group of gv
the positive weyl chamber into its negative. note that if we consider

 , which is the longest one and maps

h|2| =

4
n

,

(61)

where n is a natural number then, as a consequence of (60), nik are natural numbers for any i
and k (and if h|2| > 4, 0 > nik > 1, all bound states become unbound). these are exactly the
values of the coupling in which the soliton s-matrix for sine-gordon becomes purely elastic[29].
now we shall show that same is true for the other atfts.

7 the fact that we are adopting the convention 

2

i = 2 for the longest simple roots results that our expression

dier by a factor 1/2 from the standard expression.

in two dimensions, a two-states s-matrix must satisfy the unitarity and crossing relations

s

(i  ) = s

 ,

equivalently, one can combine both relations and obtain

(62)

(63)

(64)

s

(i + ) =(cid:2)s1()(cid:3)



in the semiclassical approximation, it is more convenient to use the crossing relation involving the
analytic continuation    + i rather than   i  , since the semiclassical approximation
breaks down on the imaginary axis, as was pointed out by coleman[31].

considering that the s-matrix is purely elastic, conditions (62) and (64) become

s()s () = 1 ,
s(i + ) = s1

 () ,

(65)

(66)

where s()  s
the semiclassical expression (47), it follows that

 (). taking  = 0 in the rst relation, it gives that s(0) = 1. then, using

(0) = nh

(67)

where n must be an integer number.

let us see the constraint the crossing relation imposes on the phase shift of atft. before
k . then, it follows from

doing this, recall the fact that[15] ck = (1)hck and[13] x()
the denition of x(n )

= (1)+1x()

, that

k

k

this relation implies that

x(n )

then, the crossing condition (66) results that

ia,kb( + i) = ia,kb(0) 

v
i  v

ia,kb(0) = ia,kb(0) +

42
|2|

v

i (cid:16)v

k + v

k(cid:17)

(mod2h)

(68)

using (60) and the fact that ia,kb(0) and ia,kb(0) must satisfy (67), it implies that the above
equation can only be consistent if the coupling satisfy the condition (61). therefore, only for these
values of the coupling the unitarity and crossing relations for purely elastic s-matrix can be fullled.
so, the s-matrix can only be purely elastic for these values but it doesnt imply that it will be
purely elastic for all these values. oncemore, this result holds at the semiclassical approximation
and in order to obtain the exact result probably one should perform a substitution like (59).
comparing relation (68) with the super-levinson relation (58) implies that ia,kb()+ia,kb() =
0 mod(2h). it would be interesting if one could calculate the constants ia,kb(0), which gives the
number of bound states in the direct channel[24].

7 conclusions.

in this paper, we have extended our vertex operator construction for non-simply laced ane lie
algebras from which we obtained the time-delay resulting from the collision of two (or more)

11

solitons. from the time-delay, we obtained the semiclassical limit for the transmission amplitude
of the two solitons s-matrix which holds for any atft. the semiclassical phase shift appeared
as a sum over bilinears on the soliton conserved charges. using the super-levison theorem, an
universal expression for the number of bound states in the direct and cross channels of the s-
matrix was obtained. we also obtained the values of the coupling in which the s-matrix can be
purely elastic. for these values, one could expect that the form of the exact phase shift would be
like (56), with p i

n being the quantum soliton conserved charges.
