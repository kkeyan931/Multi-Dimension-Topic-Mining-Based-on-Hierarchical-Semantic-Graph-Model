using a one-loop approximation for the eective potential in the higgs
model of electrodynamics for a charged scalar eld, we argue for the exis-
tence of a triple point for the renormalized (running) values of the seln-
teraction  and the charge g given by (run, g2) = (
3 2) 
(11, 17). considering the beta-function as a typical quantity we esti-
mate that the one-loop approximation is valid with accuracy of deviations
<
not more than 30% in the region of the parameters: 0.2
 1.35.
the phase diagram given in the present paper corresponds to the above-
mentioned region of , . under the point of view that the higgs particle
is a monopole with a magnetic charge g, the obtained electric ne struc-
ture constant turns out to be crit  0.185 by the dirac relation. this
value is very close to the lat
crit  0.20 which in a u (1) lattice gauge theory
corresponds to the phase transition between the coulomb and conne-
ment phases. such a result is very encouraging for the idea of an approx-
imate universality (regularization independence) of gauge couplings at
the phase transition point. this idea was suggested by the authors in
their earlier papers.

introduction

the standard model (sm) describes well all experimental results known to-
day. most eorts to explain the sm are devoted to grand unication theories
(guts). the supersymmetric extension of the sm consists of taking the sm
and adding the corresponding supersymmetric partners [1]. the precision of
the lep data allows us to extrapolate three running constants i() of the sm
(i=1,2,3 for u(1), su(2), su(3) groups) to high energies with small errors and
we are able to perform the consistency checks of guts.

in the sm based on the group

sm g = su (3)c  su (2)l  u (1)y

the usual denitions of the coupling constants are used:

1 =

5
3



cos2 ms

, 2 =



sin2 ms

, 3  s =

g2
s
4

,

(1)

(2)

where  and s are the electromagnetic and strong ne structure constants,
respectively. all of these couplings, as well as the weak angle, are dened here
in the modied minimal subtraction scheme (m s) (see reviews of particle
physics). using experimentally given parameters and the renormalization group
equations (rge), it is possible to extrapolate the experimental values of three
inverse running constants 1

() to the planck scale:

i

p l = 1.22  1019 gev.

(3)

the comparison of the evolutions of the inverses of the running coupling con-
stants in the minimal standard model (msm) (with one higgs doublet) and in
the minimal supersymmetric standard model (mssm) (with two higgs dou-
blets) shows the possibility of the existence of the grand unication point at
gut  1016 gev only in the case of the mssm (see ref.[2]). but the absence
of supersymmetric particle production at current accelerators and additional
constraints arising from limits on the contributions of virtual supersymmetric
particle exchange in a variety of the sm processes indicate that at present there
are no unambiguous experimental results requiring the existence of supersym-
metry.

scenarios based on the anti-grand unication theory (agut) was devel-
oped in refs.[3]-[14] as a realistic alternative to susy guts (see ref.[13]).
agut suggests the following assumption: supersymmetry does not exist up
to the planck scale. there is no new physics (new particles, superpartners)
up to around an order of magnitude under this scale, and the renormalization
group extrapolation of experimentally determined couplings to the planck scale
is contingent to not encountering new particles.

1

agut suggests that at the planck scale p l, considered as a fundamental
scale, there exists the more fundamental gauge group g, containing ngen copies
of the standard model group sm g:

g = sm g1  sm g2  . . .  sm gngen  (sm g)ngen ,

(4)

where the integer ngen designates the number of quark and lepton generations.

smg by denition is the following factor group:

sm g = s(u (2)  u (3)) =

u (1)  su (2)  su (3)

{(2, 122, ei2/3133)n|n  z}

.

(5)

if ngen = 3, then the fundamental gauge group g is:

g = (sm g)3 = sm g1  sm g2  sm g3,

or the generalized g:

g = (sm g)3  u (1)f

(6)

(7)

which follows from the tting of fermion masses (see ref.[11]). the group g =
(sm g)3  u (1)f is a maximal gauge transforming (nontrivially) the 45 weyl
fermions of the sm (which it extends) without unifying any of the irreducible
representations of the group of the latter. anomalies are absent in this theory.
the agut approach was used in conjunction with the multiple point prin-
ciple (mpp) proposed several years ago by d.l.bennett and h.b.nielsen [7]-[9].
another name for the same principle is the maximally degenerate vacuum
principle (mdvp). according to this principle, nature seeks a special point 
the multiple critical point (mcp)  where the group g undergoes spontaneous
breakdown to the diagonal subgroup:

g  gdiag.subgr. = {g, g, g k g  sm g}

(8)

which is identied with the usual (low-energy) group smg.

the idea of the mpp has its origin in the lattice investigations of gauge theo-
ries. in particular, monte carlo simulations on the lattice of u(1), su(2) and
su(3) gauge theories indicate the existence of a triple point. using theoreti-
cal corrections to the monte carlo results on the lattice, it is possible to make
slightly more accurate predictions of agut for the sm ne-structure constants.
the mpp assumes that the sm gauge couplings do not unify and predicts the
following values of the ne structure constants at the planck scale in terms of
the phase transition (critical) couplings taken from the lattice gauge theories:

for i = 2, 3 and

i(p l) =

i

for u(1).

this means that at the planck scale the ne structure constants y  3

5 1,
2 and 3, as chosen by nature, are just the ones corresponding to the multiple
critical point (mcp) which is a point where all action parameter (coupling)
values meet in the phase diagram of the regularized yang-mills (sm g)3  gauge
theory. nature chooses coupling constant values such that a number of vacuum
states have the same energy density. then all (or just many) numbers of phases
convene at the mcp and dierent vacua are degenerate.

the extrapolation of the experimental values of the inverses 1

y,2,3() to the
planck scale p l by the renormalization group formulae (under the assumption
of a desert in doing the extrapolation with one higgs doublet) leads to the
following result:

y (p l) = 55.5; 1
1

2 (p l) = 49.5; 1

3 (p l) = 54.

(11)

using the agut prediction given by eq.(10) and the rst value of eq.(11) we
have the following agut estimation for the u(1) ne structure constant at the
phase transition point:

1

crit  9.

(12)

previously we have also speculated and made supportive calculations [12]-
[14] that the dependence of the cut-o procedure is rather small: phase tran-
sition coupling constants would not dier very much using one or the other
regularization. so we hope that there exists what one might call an approxi-
mate universality.

for the second-order phase transitions the exact universality would be ex-
pected, but for the rst-order phase transitions, which we really hope for in
the mentioned works, such an exact universality would be quite unexpected.
however, we still believe that an approximate one really exists.
indeed, the
main purpose of the present article is to calculate the phase transition cou-
plings and to conrm this desired approximate universality. the point is
that the cut-o considered in the previous works for mpp coupling calculations
was connected with the existence of artifact monopoles in the theory: there are
artifact monopoles in the lattice gauge theory and also in the wilson loop action
model which we proposed [12].

the idea now is: instead of using the cut-o, we introduce physically existing
monopoles as fundamental elds into the theory. then one may not use the cut-
o, but can rather think of any cut-o, although essentially it should no longer
matter. in other words, we consider a theory with monopoles and look for a,
or rather several, phase transitions connected with the monopoles forming a
condensate in the vacuum. writing such a monopole theory in the dual eld
formulation, we deal with the usual higgs model.

below, using the zwanziger formalism [15][17] for the dual abelian gauge
theory describing the system with two (dual and non-dual) gauge elds and
both magnetic and electric charges (see section 3), we conrm in section 6 a

3

rather simple expression for the eective potential in the one-loop approximation
which was obtained for the higgsed scalar electrodynamics in ref.[18] (see also
ref.[19]), and investigate the phase structure of the higgs model. but now the
higgs scalar eld is identied with the monopole eld having magnetic charge
g. this means that the electric charge e is connected to the formal charge g of
this higgs eld via the dirac relation:

eg = 2,

then we can dene the electric and magnetic ne structure constants:

 = e2/4 = /g2,

 = g2/4 = /e2.

(13)

(14)

in section 5 we investigate the renormalization group equations for  and  in
the case of the existence of both charges and conrm the dirac relation for all
renormalized eective coupling constants. thus, for the arbitrary scale we have
the following relation:

  =

1
4

(15)

which is used in section 7 for the calculation of the critical (phase transition)
ne structure constants.

it seems that the region of parameters  and  near the phase transition
point (crit  0.2 and crit  1.25) obtained in the lattice investigations [21]-
[23] of the u(1) gauge theory allows us to consider the perturbation theory
in both electric and magnetic sectors with accuracy of deviations < 30% (see
section 5).

in the present paper we aim to give the explanation of lattice results and,
what is more important, to show that the rst-order phase transition arises in
the higgsed monopole model already on the level of the improved one-loop
approximation (see section 7), which describes the phase transition found on the
lattice with acceptable accuracy. thus, if the lattice phase transition coupling
roughly coincides with our colemanweinberg model it cannot depend much on
lattice details. as it will be shown below, such a perturbation theory reproduces
the lattice result. thus we get the suggested approximate universality even
for rst-order phase transitions.

2 phase transition coupling in lattice u(1) gauge

theory (compact qed)

as was mentioned in section 1, the idea of the mpp is based on the lattice
investigations of gauge theories. in particular, monte carlo simulations of the
u(1) gauge theory described by the following lattice action:

[ cos () +  cos 2()]

(16)

s =x

4

(here () is the plaquette variable) indicate the existence of the triple point
[21]-[23] on the phase diagram shown in fig.1. from this triple point emanate
three phase borders: the phase border 1 separates the totally conning phase
from the phase where only the discrete subgroup z2 is conned; the phase
border 2 separates the latter phase from the totally coulomb-like phase; and
the phase border 3 separates the totally conning and totally coulomb-like
phases.

in the speculative ideas which were proposed to provide a mechanism for
the mpp degeneracy of vacua in nature, one typically gets the prediction that
the phase transition is rst order [7]-[9] - for instance, if the world is in a state
analogous to a microcanonical ensemble leading to a mixture of phases.

in the higgs monopole model considered in this paper you nd a priori
formally rst-order transitions, but it is possible to give some estimates showing
that this may not always be expected to be true at the end. we shall leave this
problem for the next paper.

in search for a lattice formulation of qed with a second order phase transi-
tion, the simple wilson action was generalized to eq.(16) by including a double
charge term with coupling  [20] in the expectation that the phase transition
would be driven towards second-order at suciently small negative values of .
the recent lattice simulations of compact qed [23]-[31] have still not suc-
ceeded in agreement when they clarify the order of the phase transition near
 = 1. however, simulations on the hyper-torus, up to  = - 0.4, revealed the
reappearance of a double peak on large enough lattices [28]. in addition, for
 between + 0.2 and - 0.4 the critical exponent  has been found to decrease
towards 1
4 (which corresponds to the rst-order phase transition [30]) with in-
creasing lattice size for toroidal as well for spherical geometry. in some cases
stabilization of the latent heat has been observed. now we have rather strong
indications that, at least in the region up to  = - 0.4, the phase transition is
of rst order.

fig.1 represents this situation showing, the tricritical point at some negative
value of the parameter . of course, it remains desirable to check this result on
still larger lattices.

in ref.[21] the behaviour of the eective ne structure constant () (here
 = 1/e2
0, and e0 is the bare electric charge) were investigated in the vicinity
of the phase transition point for the case  = 0, and the following values of the
ne structure constants at the phase transition point was obtained:

lat

crit  0.20,

lat

crit  1.25,

at

crit  1.011.

(17)

considering the villain lattice action which corresponds to the extended
wilson action (16) with    0.22, the authors of ref.[23] revised the values
of the renormalized electrical coupling  obtained in ref.[21] and presented :

lat  0.1836,

lat  1.36 in the vicinity of the phase transition point. (18)

5

the compact lattice qed is essentially related to the monopoles. the phase
transition coulomb - connement is known to be associated with the con-
densation of magnetic monopoles [23],[29],[32]-[34]. monopole vacuum loops
renormalize the ne structure constant  by an amount proportional to the
susceptibility of the monopole gas [34]. the enhancement factor of this renor-
malization was estimated in ref.[12]:

k =

crit(monte carlo)

crit(theory without monopoles)

 1.66.

(19)

the power law scaling behaviour of the monopole mass and condensate was
observed in ref.[23]. using their results we have extracted the ratio of the
monopole mass to the monopole condensate  =< 0||0 > ( is a monopole
eld) in the connement phase, a little bit away from the phase transition point
(but near to it):

m


 2.4.

(20)

by this little bit away we allude to the fact that m/ varies rather little except
for  being shorter than   0.04 away from crit. that is, the ratio (20)
takes place in the slowly varying region when approaching the phase transition.
in the lattice gauge theory monopoles are not physical objects: they are

lattice artifacts driven to innite mass in the continuum limit.

also in ref.[12], instead of the lattice hypercubic regularization, we have
considered rather new regularization using non-local wilson loop action in the
approximation of circular loops of radii r  a. it was shown that the critical
ne structure constant is rather independent of the regularization method. its
value is given by the following expression:

crit  0.204,

(21)

in correspondence with the monte carlo simulation result (17),(18) on the lat-
tice. such a phase transition coupling universality is needed too much for the
ne structure constant predictions claimed from the mpp. but independently
of the multiple point model, the approximate universality (if it takes place)
is an important phenomenon for the phase transition in any gauge eld theory.

3 the zwanziger formalism for the abelian gauge

theory with electric and magnetic charges

in the lattice gauge theories and in the nonlocal wilson loop model mentioned
in section 2, monopoles are artifacts of the regularization. let us assume
now a physically existing fundamental regulator. the new idea is to consider
monopoles as fundamental elds. with the aim of conrming the universality of
the critical couplings in this case, we have investigated for a phase transition the

6

quantum eld theory with electric and magnetic charges considering monopoles
as higgs scalar particles.

a version of the local eld theory of electrically and magnetically charged
particles is represented by zwanziger formalism [15],[16] (see also [17]) which
considers two potentials a(x) and b(x) describing one physical photon with
two physical degrees of freedom. now and below we call this theory qemd
(quantum electromagnetodynamics).

in qemd the total eld system of the gauge, electrically () and magnet-
ically () charged elds is described by the partition function which has the
following form in euclidean space:

where

z =z [da][db][d][d ][d][d ]es

s = szw(a, b) + sgf + se + sm.

(22)

(23)

the zwanziger action szw(a, b) is given by:

the actions se and sm:

describe, respectively, the electrically and magnetically charged matter elds,
and sgf is the gauge-xing action.

at the same time we present the generating functional with external sources

the complex scalar eld:

now we have a number of possibilities to describe electrically charged elds
(below we give the lagrangian expressions in minkowski space). they can be:

a) fermions (electrons) described by the dirac lagrangian:

le = l(f )

e = (id  e),

4 dual symmetry

duality is a symmetry appearing in free electromagnetism as invariance of the
free (static) maxwell equations:

  ~b = 0,

  ~e = 0,

  ~e = 0,

  ~b = 0,

under the interchange of electric and magnetic elds:

letting

~e  ~b,

~b  ~e.

f =   a = (  b),

f  =   b = (  a),

9

(42)

(43)

(44)

(45)

(46)

it is easy to see that the following equations:

with the bianchi identity:

f = 0

f 

 = 0,

(47)

(48)

equivalent to eqs.(42), (43) are invariant under the hodge star operation on the
eld tensor:

f 

 =

f

(49)

1
2

(here f  = f ).

this hodge star duality applied to the free zwanziger lagrangian (24) leads

to its invariance under the following duality transformations:

f  f ,

(  a)  (  b),

(  a)  (  b).

(50)

introducing the interacting maxwell equations:

f = je
,

f 

 = jm
 ,

with the local conservation laws for electric and magnetic charge:

je,m

 = 0,

(51)

(52)

(53)

we immediately see the invariance of these equations under the exchange of the
electric and magnetic elds (hodge star duality) provided that at the same time
the electric and magnetic charges and currents (and masses of the electrically
and magnetically charged particles if they are dierent) are also interchanged:

e  g,

je
  jm


(54)

(and e  m). we shall consider this symmetry as the generalized duality.

the quantum eld theory with electric ei and magnetic gi charges is self-
consistent if both charges are quantized according to the famous dirac relation
[38]:

eigj = 2nij

(55)

when nij is an integer. considering nij = 1 in eq.(55) we obtain the dirac
quantization condition (13) in terms of the elementary electric and magnetic
charges.

if the fundamental electric charge e is so small that it corresponds to the
perturbative electric theory, then magnetic charges are large and correspond to
the strongly interacting magnetic theory, and vice versa. but below we consider
some small region of e, g values (we hope that it exists) which allows us to
employ the perturbation theory in both the electric and magnetic sectors.

10

when nontrivial dyons  particles with both electric and magnetic charges
simultaneously  are present, then the analogue of the dirac relation becomes
a bit more complicated and it then reads:

eigj  ejgi = 2nij

(56)

which is duality invariant (see for example the review [39] and the references
there).

the relation (56) has the name of the diracschwingerzwanziger [15],[38],[40]

quantization condition. but the dyon theory is not exploited in this paper.

now we are ready to calculate the eective potential. but rst we prefer
to consider the dirac relation and the renormalization group equations for the
renormalized electric and magnetic ne structure constants.

5 renormalization group equations for the elec-
tric and magnetic fine structure constants.
the dirac relation

it is well known that in the absence of monopoles, the gell-mannlow equation
has the following form:

where

d(log (p))

dt

= ((p))

t = log(p2/m 2),

(57)

(58)

p is a 4-momentum and  = e2/4.

the gell-mannlow function () depends on the lagrangian describing
theory. as the was rst shown in refs.[35], at suciently small charge ( < 1)
the function is given by series over /4:

() = 2(


4

) + 4(

2
)


4

+ ...

(59)

the rst two terms of this series were calculated in a qed long time ago in
refs.[35],[36]. the following result was obtained in the framework of the per-
turbation theory (in the one- and two-loop approximations):

a)

and

b)

2 =

4
3

2 =

1
3

and 4 = 4  for fermion (electron) loops

(60)

and 4 = 1  for scalar particle loops.

(61)

11

this result means that for both cases a) and b) the -function can be represented
by the following series arising from eq.(59):

() = 2(


4

)(1 + 3


4

+ ...)

(62)

and we are able to exploit the one-loop approximation (given by the rst term
of eqs.(59) and (62)) up to   1 (with accuracy  25% for the   1).

it is necessary to comment that three- and higher loop approximations de-
pend on the renormalization scheme. we do not discuss this problem in the
present paper.

the dirac relation and the renormalization group equations (rge) for the
electric and magnetic ne structure constants  and  were investigated in detail
by the authors in the recent paper [37] where the same zwanziger formalism was
developed for qemd. the following result was obtained:

d log (p)

dt

= 

d log (p)

dt

= (e)()  (m)().

(63)

it is easy to see that these rg-equations are in accordance with the dirac
relation (15) and with the generalized duality considered in section 4.

in eq.(63) the functions (e)() and (m)() are described by the contri-
butions of the electrically and magnetically charged particle loops, respectively.
their analytical expressions coincide with the usual well-known functions of
qed given by eq.(59), at least on the level of the two-loop approximation.

it is necessary to give some explanations how the result (63) was obtained.
j.schwinger had shown [40] that the dirac relation (13) is valid not only for

the bare e0 and g0, but also for the renormalized eective charges e and g:

eg = e0g0 = 2.

eq.(64) conrms the equality:

d log (p)

dt

= 

d log (p)

dt

(64)

(65)

and means that the dirac relation is valid for all scales, e.g. for all t in rge
(63).

if the derivative d log (p)/dt in qemd is also only a function of the eective
ne structure constants as in the gell-mannlow theory then we can write, in
general, the following rge:

d log (p)

dt

d log (p)

dt

= 1() + 2() + c,

= 1() + 2() + c.

12

(66)

(67)

in eqs.(66),(67) the terms containing the product   are absent due to the dirac
relation (15). applying to eqs.(66),(67) the duality symmetry (the invariance
under the interchange   ) and using eq.(65) (which is the consequence of
the dirac relation) it is not dicult to establish the following relations:

1() = 2() =  1() = 2(),

c = c = 0.

(68)

this result conrms the validity of rge (63) with the function (m)() given
by the same analytical expressions as the (e)function in .

from eqs.(59) and (62) we see that it is possible to consider the perturbation
theory for (e)() and (m)() simultaneously if both  and  are suciently
small. then the functions (e,m) are given by the usual series similar to (59)
and calculated in qed. if we are limited by the two-loop approximation, we
have the following equations (63) for the cases a) and b):

d log (p)

dt

= 

d log (p)

dt

= 2

  

4

(1 + 3

 + 

4

+ ....).

(69)

it is not dicult to see that two rst terms of this series (one-loop and two-
loop contributions) coincide with previous results of the perturbative qed, but
we have the dierence on the level of higher-order approximations when the
monopole (electric particle) loops begin to play a role in the electric (monopole)
loops.

according to eq.(69) the one-loop approximation works with an accuracy of

deviations < 30% if both  and  obey the following requirement:

0.25 < ,  < 1.

(70)

for the compact (lattice) qed eqs.(17) and (18) demonstrate that  and  ,
considering in the vicinity of the phase transition point, almost coincide with
the borders of the requirement (70) given by the perturbation theory for 
functions. we can expect that these phase transition couplings may be de-
scribed by the one-loop approximation with accuracy not worse than (30  50)%
although, strictly speaking, we do not know the exact behaviour of the asymp-
totic series (59) or (69).

6 the colemanweinberg eective potential for
the higgs model with electric and magnetic
charged scalar fields

the eective potential in the higgs model of electrodynamics for a charged
scalar eld was calculated in the one-loop approximation for the rst time by

13

the authors of ref.[18]. the general methods of the calculation of the eective
potential are given in ref.[19]. using these methods we have constructed the ef-
fective potential (also in the one-loop approximation) for the theory with electric
and magnetic charges. such a qemd is described by the partition function (22)
with the action s containing the zwanziger action (24), gauge xing action (41)
and the actions (26) for matter elds. monopoles are considered in this theory
as higgs scalar particles and the corresponding lagrangian is given by eq.(29).
electrically charged elds can be described by the lagrangians (33)-(35).

let us consider now the shifts:

(x) = b + (x),

 = b + (x)

(71)

with b and b as background elds and calculate the following expression for
the partition function in the one-loop approximation:

z =z [da][db][d ][d ][d ][d ] 

exp{s(a, b, b + , b + )z d4x[

s()
(x)
= exp{f [b, b, g2, e2, 2

|=b

(x)+

s()
(x)

|=b

(x)]}

m, 2

e, m, e]}.

(72)

using the representation (32) and writing a similar one for the complex

scalar eld :

 =  + i,

we obtain the eective potential:

vef f = f [b, b, g2, e2, 2

m, 2

e, m, e]

given by the function f of eq.(72) for the constant background elds:

b = b = const,

b = b = const.

(73)

(74)

(75)

lagrangians considered in section 3 indicate that the interaction between the
electric charges and monopoles appears in the vacuum diagrams only on the
level of the two-loop approximation and in higher orders of the perturbative
corrections to the classical potential.

thus, in the one-loop approximation we have:

vef f = v (m)

ef f + v (e)
ef f .

(76)

the potential v (e)
ef f following from the lagrangian (35) was calculated in the one-
loop approximation by authors of ref.[18]. the same expression takes place for

14

v (m)
ef f . using from now the designations:  = m,  = m  we can present the
following expression for v (m)

ef f [18],[19]:

v (m)
ef f =

where m is the cut-o scale.

the same expression (77), but with  = e,  = e and with b instead of

b takes place for the v (e)
ef f .

the eective potential (74) has several minima. their position depends on

e2, g2, 2

(e,m) and (e,m).

it is easy to see that the rst local minimum occurs at b = 0 and b = 0
and corresponds to the so-called symmetric phase which is the coulomb-like
phase in our description.

there exists only one vacuum b = 0 for the lagrangians (33) and (34) if we
describe the electric sector by the cases a) and b). but in all cases our model is
interested in the phase transition from the coulomb-like phase b = b = 0
to the connement phase b = 0, b 6= 0. thus, in our investigation we have
to use:

v (e)
ef f = 0

and vef f = v (m)
ef f .

(78)

let us consider now the second local minimum at b = 0. we have the
phase transition from the coulomb-like phase to the connement phase if the
second local minimum at b = 0 is degenerate with the rst local minimum
at 0 = 0 (see solid curve in fig.2).

to use this one-loop approximation for the eective potential calculation in
the parameter combinations giving degenerate minima  as we want  really
means that for the case when there is a compensation between the classical
(bare) and the one-loop terms, the latter are of the same order as the rst ones,
and then the loop expansion is a priori not reliable. but it could of course still
be hoped that the accuracy of one-loop corrections would be suciently good
even in the case of the cancellation. what we are looking for is not to know the
sign of the eective potential exactly in a region where we are close to the shift
of the sign, but rather to know when one eective potential goes below zero as
a function of the gauge coupling, say. the latter could have a better chance of
being to sucient accuracy calculable.

7 calculation of the critical coupling in the

the eective potential is given by the following expression equivalent to eq.(77):

(81)

the conditions for the degenerate vacua are given by the following equations:

(84)

it is easy to obtain the solution of eqs.(82) and (83) assuming that the last
term in eq.(79) is small. neglecting the third term in eq.(79) we obtain:

vef f

and eq.(82) gives us the following relation:

in the following calculations we replace the bare constants  and  by run
and run assuming that only renormalized constants have a sense in the eld
theory considered (it is natural to think that they will appear in higher orders

16

of perturbative corrections). from now we have not only the one-loop approxi-
mation.

using eqs.(80), (81) and (86) we obtain:

(91)

gives us a triple point a at the phase diagram shown in fig.3. three phases
 coulomb and two conning ones  are present in this diagram. the phase
border 1 separates the phases (conf inement)1 and (conf inement)2. here we
have:

vef f (0) = 0 , v (0) = 0

and

v (0) < 0

 for the (conf inement)1 phase.

and

vef f (2

0) < 0 , v (2

0) = 0

and

v (2

0) > 0

 for the (conf inement)2 phase.

the phase transition border 1 in fig.3 corresponds to something similar
to the case presented in fig.2 by the dashed curve, where we have two minima
at  = 1 and  = 2:

vef f (2
ef f (2

1) = vef f (2
ef f (2

1) = v 

2),
2) = 0.

v 

(92)

(93)

the curve 1 in fig.3 is calculated in the vicinity of the triple point a by
means of eqs.(92) and (93) and is described by the following expression:

g4 =

(94)

the phase border 2 in fig.3 separates the (conf inement)2 and coulomb-like
phases. this border is given by the following equations:

vef f (2

1,2) = 0;

ef f (2
v 

1,2) = 0

(95)

17

which coincide with eqs.(82) and (83), but now in the region of numerically
smaller and still negative run we have more than two minima (see dashed
curve in fig.2). at rst, we had two minima at  = 0 and  = 0. now we
have three minima, but the previous 0minimum has transformed analytically
into a maximum.

the curve 3 in fig.3 given by eq.(89) corresponds to the border between

the (conf inement)1 and coulomb-like phases.

the solution of eqs.(82), (83) and (91) gives us the intersection of the curves
(89) and (94) which determines the position of a triple point. this point a in
fig.3 is given by

the last result follows from eq.(89) and corresponds to the following triple point
value of the magnetic ne structure constant:

(a)  1.35.

(98)

then the dirac relation (15) allows us to calculate the value of the triple point
electric ne structure constant:

(a) =



(g(a))2 =

 0.185,

(99)

in agreement with the monte carlo lattice results (17),(18) and with the wilson
loop action model given by eq.(21). here we are successful in the conrmation
of the critical coupling approximate universality.

notice that from eq.(86) we have |run| > |0|. the estimation of their

ratio at the triple point a gives:

|run|
|0|

{at the triple point a} s (a)

run
2

 2.35.

(100)

this value coincides with the lattice result (20) with high accuracy. taking
into account that our higgsed monopole model gives the rst-order phase tran-
sition, it is a small wonder that we got the result corresponding to the lattice
connement phase. at least, it is necessary to think about such coincidences.

eq.(100) shows that the mass of the monopole is large compared to the 0
scale at which our calculation leading to the result (99) is presumably correct.
so there are no rg running due to monopoles between the 0scale and the
infra-red limit. in consequence, the infra-red limit coupling should not be rg
corrected by monopole contributions and will just be our value (99).

18

let us consider now if the assumption that the third term in eq.(79) is

negligibly small is selfconsistent with our calculations.

we have the following expression equivalent to eq.(79):

vef f =

}.

(101)
the largest value of 2 is 2  m 2, which allows us to estimate the value of the
third term in the brackets of eq.(101) in the vicinity of the second minimum
when b = 0. using the designation:

v (3)
ef f (2) =

4
642 log

(2 + 32)(2 + 2)

m 4

(102)

we can consider the ratio

r = v (3)

(103)

then eq.(86) gives us:

r =

run
642 log

(2 + 32

0)(2 + 2
0)
m 4

<

run
642 log 5.

at the triple point a the value of r is determined by eq.(96):

r(a) < 0.018 log 5  0.03.

(104)

(105)

really, we have r << 1. this result conrms the negligibility of the third term
in eq.(79) for vef f near the second minimum shown in fig.2.

the values (99) and (98) obtained in our higgsed monopole model for the
triple point electric and magnetic ne structure constants correspond to the
one-loop approximation for the eective potential and can be improved by the
consideration of the higher-loop corrections. however, this result is close to
the borders of the perturbation theory requirement (70). the phase diagram
shown in fig.3 resembles the region (70) having slight deviations. if one adds
electrically charged particles then the corrections from their contributions are
to be taken into account. but on the level of the one-loop approximation we
have only monopoles. we think that in all cases our results are guaranteed with
accuracy less than 50%. however, it seems that the idea of the approximate
universality of the critical coupling constants is conrmed.

8 conclusions

we have used the colemanweinberg eective potential for the higgs model
with the higgs eld  conceived as a monopole scalar eld to enumerate a

19

phase diagram suggesting that in addition to the phase with <  >= 0 (i.e.
the coulomb phase) we have two dierent phases with <  >6= 0 meaning, two
dierent connement phases (conf inement)1 and (conf inement)2. these three
phases meet at a triple point and we calculated what we called the eective or
running run and g2 couplings at this triple point a:

(107)

(108)

it is noticed that these triple point ne structure constant values coincide
rather well with the values of the ne structure constant at the phase transition
point for a u(1) lattice gauge theory (see eqs.(17) and (18)). but for the values
(107) and (108) giving the perturbative region of parameters:

0.2 < ,  < 1.35

(109)

we cannot guarantee the accuracy of deviations better than 30%, as follows from
the estimation of the two-loop contributions (section 5).

hereby we see a strong argument for our previously hoped-for principle of
approximate universality for the rst-order phase transitions: the ne struc-
ture constant (in the continuum) is at the/a multiple point approximately the
same one, independent of various parameters of the (lattice e.g.) regularization.
this is indeed rst suggested by the agreement of the above-obtained value
(a) = 0.185 with the phase-border value in the various dierent regularizations.
secondly we could also argue:

(all) various dierent regularizations for u(1) electrodynamics which usually
should have artifact monopoles could, in the philosophy of going back and forth
between continuum and, say, lattice regularization, be described by the higgs
model with  interpreted as a monopole scalar eld.

since we showed that we could calculate the triple point in this continuum
theory all the various regularizations in which artifact monopoles are presumed
connected with the phase transitions must have approximately the same con-
tinuum parameters at the triple point.

all dierent versions of u(1) lattice gauge theories have normally artifact
monopoles.
if they are approximated by a continuum eld model it should
be the higgs model interpreted as in the present article and our triple point
(a)  0.185 would be the coupling at the triple point of whatever u(1) lattice

20

gauge theory. this is our previously suggested approximate universality which
is quite necessary for the agut and mpp predictions. to the point, the result
(107) obtained in our higgsed monopole model gives:

1

crit  5.4

(110)

which is comparable (in the framework of our accuracy) with agut-mpp pre-
diction (12). the details of this problem are discussed in refs.[7]-[9].

we have a hope that the two-loop approximation corrections to the coleman
weinberg eective potential will lead to much better accuracy in the calculation
of the phase transition couplings, but this is an aim of our next papers.
