abstract

we nd the seiberg-witten geometry for four dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric e6
gauge theories with massless fundamental hypermultiplets, by geometrically embedding
them in type ii string theories compactied on calabi-yau threefolds. the resulting
geometry completely agrees with that of recent works, which are based on the technique
of n = 1 conning phase superpotentials. we also derive the seiberg-witten geometry
for e7 gauge theories with massive fundamental hypermultiplets.

1 introduction

in the past few years, there has been much development in our understanding of non-

perturbative properties of supersymmetric gauge theories and superstring theories. on

one hand, it has been found that exact results for the coulomb branch of n = 2 gauge

theories in four dimensions can be obtained by considering auxiliary riemann surfaces

[1]. on the other hand, it has been also recognized that d-branes play the role of solitonic

objects, and realize enhanced gauge symmetries especially in type ii string theories com-

pactied on singular manifolds [2]. it would be tempting to put these together, namely to

embed n = 2 gauge theories in string theories and conjecture that the riemann surfaces

on eld theory side originate from compactifying manifolds on string theory side.

calabi-yau threefold compactication of type ii string theories indeed provides a sys-

tematic way of nding exact solutions of four dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric gauge

theories [3, 4, 5]. however, a low energy eective theory of type ii string theories contains

not only gauge theory degrees of freedom, but also a gravity multiplet. in calabi-yau

compactication approach, the gauge theory elds propagate near the singularities of the

calabi-yau, as contrasted to the gravity multiplet which propagates on the entire calabi-

yau space. we can therefore decouple gravity eects and consider pure gauge theories by

focusing on the vicinity of the calabi-yau singularities.

if we construct a gauge theory from type iia string theory, the coulomb branch of

the gauge theory is identied with the kahler moduli of the compactifying calabi-yau.

in type iia theory, the kahler moduli receive quantum corrections due to worldsheet

instanton eects. so, one-loop and non-perturbative corrections to the coulomb branch

are not computable from type iia perspective. this defect can be remedied by mapping

the kahler moduli of the type iia calabi-yau to the complex moduli of the mirror calabi-

yau compactifying type iib theory. since the complex moduli of the type iib calabi-yau

is free from quantum corrections, the exact metric on the coulomb branch can be obtained

from classical type iib calabi-yau geometry.

in this article, we concentrate on e6 and e7 gauge theories with fundamental matter.

for the e6 case, the seiberg-witten geometry with massless fundamental hypermultiplets

is derived from the mirror symmetry between type iia and type iib string theories. the

resulting geometry coincides with that obtained in [6]. for the e7 case, we apply various

1

decoupling limits to the gauge theory, to obtain the geometry with massive fundamental

hypermultiplets. the result is again consistent with [7], which have presented the ge-

ometry with a massless half hypermultiplet. in both cases, the seiberg-witten geometry

has the form of an ale bration over 2-sphere, with the bration data being slightly

complicated due to the existence of extra matter. the appearance of ale bration is not

specic to the present e6 and e7 cases. in general, the vector moduli information of an

n = 2 gauge theory is expected to be more naturally encoded in an ale bration over

2-sphere, than in a one complex dimensional space [8]. n = 2 eld theories with other

exceptional and some so(n) gauge groups are discussed in [7, 9].

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2, we derive the seiberg-witten geometry

for e6 gauge theories with massless fundamental matter, by geometrically realizing them

on calabi-yau singularities. in section 3, the seiberg-witten geometry is presented for

e7 gauge theories with massive fundamental matter. as a by-product, we will also nd

the geometry for so(12) gauge theories with massive fundamentals and spinors. the last

section is devoted to discussion and conclusions.

2 geometric construction of e6 gauge theories

in this section, we will investigate a mirror pair of type iia and type iib string theories

compactied on calabi-yau threefolds. type iia string theory has an advantage that

gauge groups and matter representations are easily identied. however, the seiberg-

witten geometry can be directly obtained from the calabi-yau compactifying type iib

string theory. these are why we deal with both type iia and type iib string theories, not

only with one of them. throughout this section, toric geometry will play a crucial role.

for details of toric geometry and its application to mirror symmetry, the reader should

consult references [10, 11, 12, 13], where sections 9 and 10 of greenes review [13] contain

a basic introduction.

we consider rst type iia string theory compactied on a calabi-yau threefold x,

which is a k3 bration over p1 surface. furthermore, we assume that the k3 ber itself

is an elliptic bration over p1. therefore the calabi-yau x can also be regarded as an

elliptic bration over the hirzebruch surface fn, where the integer n determines how p1 is

bered over p1 in fn. type iia string theory on x in this particular class is conjectured

2

to be dual to e8  e8 heterotic string theory on k3  t 2, with no wilson line turned on
t 2 [14, 15]. it is then possible to consistently take a large volume limit of t 2, and lift

the duality to the six dimensional one. this heterotic dual description in six dimensions

strongly suggests that the gauge symmetries and matter representations we will determine

in the following are correct [16].

in order for the gauge theory resulting from this compactication of type iia string

theory to possess e6 gauge symmetry, the k3 ber has to develop an e6 type singularity.

this requirement is equivalent to that the elliptic ber degenerates as one approaches some

point on the p1 base of the k3 ber, with the degeneration being of e6 type. such a
singular calabi-yau x can be embedded in a wp2

1,2,3 bundle over fn. let (x, y, z), (s, t),
1,2,3, the p1 ber of fn, and the p1

and (u, v) be the homogeneous coordinates on wp2

base of fn, respectively. the weights of them are as follows:

x

1 0 0 0 0,
0 1 1 0 0,
2n + 4 3n + 6 0 n 0 1 1.

s

y

(2.1)

then, x is written as the hypersurface equation [16]

y2 = x3 + f (s, t; u, v)xz4 + g(s, t; u, v)z6,

(2.2)

where

f (s, t; u, v) =

i

xi=3

sit8if8+n(4i)(u, v),

g(s, t; u, v) =

sjt12jg12+n(6j)(u, v).

(2.3)

j

xj=4

in (2.3), f8+n(4i) and g12+n(6j) are homogeneous polynomials of degrees specied by

their subscripts. the indices i and j denote the largest values of i and j such that all the

degrees appearing in (2.3) are not negative. the fact that f (s, t; u, v) and g(s, t; u, v) are
divisible by s3 and t4 guarantees that the k3 ber has an e6 singularity, provided that
the polynomials f8+n(4i) and g12+n(6j) have generic coecients.

there are a few comments on the type iia calabi-yau x given by (2.2) with (2.3).

first, there may exist some singularities other than the e6 singularity in which we are

now interested, when the polynomials f8+n(4i) and g12+n(6j) have some special forms.

if this occurs, some extra gauge theories will arise from the other singularities. we have

then to decouple somehow the extra gauge theories from our e6 gauge theory. we will

3

argue this subtlety later in this section. second, in addition to the e6 vector multiplet,

the calabi-yau x automatically incorporates nf  n + 6 hypermultiplets in fundamental

representation [16]. the hypermultiplets are localized at nf extra singularities on the
p1 base of fn, i.e., the points where the e6 singularity of the k3 ber becomes worse

[16, 17, 18]. hereafter, we will assume 6  n < 2 to ensure that the gauge theory

is asymptotically free, and nf  0. the lower bound n  6 is also required from the

restriction that the e6 gauge group must not be enhanced to larger gauge groups. the

upper bound n < 2 has another geometrical meaning, as we will see later.

one can resolve the e6 singularity of the k3 ber by blowing up the ambient space,

the wp2

1,2,3 bundle, at the locus {x = y = s = 0}. the smooth calabi-yau x obtained
by the resolution admits a toric description, which is given by a polyhedron  whose

vertices consist of the following vectors [19, 16],

v0 = (0, 0, 0, 0),
v1 = (1, 0, 0, 0),
v2 = (0, 1, 0, 0),
v3 = (2, 3, 0, 0),
v4 = (0, 0, 1, 0),
v5 = (4, 6, 1, 0),
v6 = (0, 0, 0, 1),
v7 = (2n  4, 3n  6, n, 1),
v8 = (2, 3, 1, 0),
v9 = (3, 5, 2, 0),
v10 = (4, 6, 3, 0),
v11 = (3, 4, 2, 0),
v12 = (2, 2, 1, 0),
v13 = (2, 3, 2, 0).

(2.4)

as is well known in toric geometry, each vertex vi in (2.4) is associated with a divisor di
in x. the three vertices v1, v2, and v3 describe the divisors in the wp2

1,2,3 ber, {x =
0}, {y = 0}, and {z = 0} restricted on x. similarly, v4, v5, v6, and v7 are identied with

the divisors in the fn base in x, {s = 0}, {t = 0}, {u = 0}, and {v = 0}. the six vertices

v8,    , v13 represent the six exceptional divisors arising from the resolution (as we will see

below, their restriction on the k3 ber constitute six p1 surfaces, whose intersection form

is nothing but the e6 cartan matrix). finally, notice that the polyhedron  contains

only one vector v0 as its interior point.

in general, for the hypersurface dened by a

polyhedron to be calabi-yau, it is necessary that the polyhedron has a unique interior

4

point [11]. the unique interior point corresponds to the canonical divisor of the ambient

toric variety.

our next task is to present type iib calabi-yau x, which is the mirror partner of x.

the calabi-yau x takes the form of hypersurface equation

aiyi = 0,

13

xi=0

(2.5)

where the complex numbers ai parametrize the complex deformation moduli of x. the
complex variables yi are not independent of each other but obey the constraints

(2.6)

where l(a) are fourteen dimensional vectors such that the following linear relations hold:

l(a)
i (vi, 1) = 0.

13

xi=0

(2.7)

here, (vi, 1) denotes the ve dimensional vector made by adding the fth component 1
to the vector vi. in the present case, the number of independent l(a)s is nine, hence the
index a runs from 1 to 9 in (2.6) and (2.7). the explicit form of l(a) is given by

note that the weights of the wp2

1,2,3 bundle (2.1) appears in the 3  7 entries l(a)

i



(2.8)

(a =

1, 2, 3; i = 1,    , 7). moreover, in (2.8) the e6 cartan matrix has emerged as the 66 com-
ponents l(a)
(a = 4,    , 9; i = 8,    , 13). in general, each linear relation l(a) corresponds

i

5

to a curve class c a in x. it is also well known that the component l(a)
is proportional
in the present analysis, l(4),    , l(9) are identied
to the intersection number c a  di.
with the six blown up 2-spheres in the k3 ber, 1 and d8,    , d13 correspond to the six

i

exceptional divisors in x. if we restrict these exceptional divisors on the k3 ber of x,

they become identical to the six blown up 2-spheres. therefore, the appearance of the

e6 cartan matrix ensures that the six exceptional p1s in the k3 ber lead to e6 gauge

symmetry.

let us now turn to examining the type iib hypersurface (2.5). because of the relation
i=0 l(a)
p13

i = 0 following from (2.7), both of the equations (2.5) and (2.6) are invariant
under the rescaling yi  yi,   c. it is thus allowed to scale yis and put one of them

to unity. we take here y10 = 1. then, the constraints (2.6) can be solved by the four

independent variables x1  y9, x2  y11, x3  y13, and   y6, that is, all other yis can

be represented by some powers of x1, x2, x3, and . the type iib mirror manifold (2.5) is

thus rewritten in terms of x1, x2, x3, and  as

we require b, c, a8,    , a13 to depend on m0 so that wi (i = 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12) are xed at

some constants in the limit m0  . we can make all terms in the third and fourth line

of (2.11) vanish in the limit m0  , by demanding that b, c, and a12 depend on m0 in

the following way:

b = m0d2 + d3 + o(cid:18) 1

where d2, d3, and d4 are arbitrary constants independent of m0. note that w2 = d2 +

o(1/m0), as one can see from the rst equation in (2.13). surprisingly, all the coecients

entering in the r.h.s. of (2.12) are kept nite in the limit m0  , as far as (2.13) and

(2.14) are satised. hence, while the second term in the r.h.s. of (2.11) gives rise to a
12 disappear

non-vanishing contribution, the two terms proportional to 1/m3

6 and 1/m5

in the limit m3, m5  .

eventually, we end up with the seiberg-witten geometry for the e6 gauge theory of

the form

(2.17)

the expression (2.17), which controls the ale bration data for the theories with funda-

mental matter, was derived from (2.12), (2.13), and (2.14). the resultant manifold (2.15)

with (2.16) and (2.17) completely agrees with that obtained in [6], which has been derived

from the technique of n = 1 conning phase superpotentials [20, 21, 22].

before closing this section, it is instructive to explain here why we had to take the

limit m0, m3, m5  , to obtain the correct answer. as pointed out above, we must pay

attention to the vicinity of the e6 singularity of the type iia k3 ber, in order to ap-

propriately ignore the eects from some other gauge theories. since the e6 singularity is

located at the locus {x = y = s = 0} in x, the divisors {z = 0} and {t = 0} which corre-

spond to the vertices v3 and v5 in (2.4) are distant from the singularity. on the contrary,

all other divisors in the k3 ber (which are given by the vertices v1, v2, v4, v8,    , v13)

intersect at least one of the exceptional divisors appearing from the singularity. thus,

we may eliminate the vertices v3 and v5 from (2.4), to forget about other gauge theo-

ries, without aecting the e6 gauge theory localized at the e6 singularity. in the present
mirror map, the divisors v3 and v5 in x are mapped to the monomials a3y3 = 1

figure 1: decompactication of wp2

1,2,3 bundle over p1.

m3, m5   can be interpreted as extracting the gauge theory data encoded in the e6

singularity, and ignoring the region far from the singularity.

in toric geometry language, removing the two vertices v3 and v5 amounts to decom-

pactifying the k3 ber of x. indeed, as we depict in figure 1, the wp2

1,2,3 bundle over
p1 which is described by v1,    , v5, is decompactied into c3 which is described by v1, v2,
and v4. 2 since the k3 ber is holomorphically embedded in the wp2

1,2,3 bundle, the k3
is also decompactied in this process. the divisors {z = 0} and {t = 0} are sent far away

from the e6 singularity. the precise meaning of the terminology decompactication

used here is that the volumes of the ber and the base of the elliptic k3 surface become

relatively large compared to those of the exceptional p1s. under this condition, while the

masses of the w bosons corresponding to d2-branes wrapped on the exceptional p1s

are kept nite, we can decouple the undesirable elds coming from d2-branes wrapped

on the ber and the base of the elliptic k3 surface.

however, innitely enlarging the k3 is not enough for gravity and stringy eects to

be properly decoupled. in order to completely switch o gravity and stringy eects, we

must take the point particle limit ls  0, where ls is the string length. because gauge

elds live on six dimensional space (four dimensional at space times the p1 base of fn),

2 we examined here only the toric data for the wp2

3 bundle over p1, not for the entire toric
variety, the wp2
3 bundle over fn. however, it is straightforward to check that the entire toric variety
is actually decompactied into a c3 bundle over p1, if the asymptotic freedom condition n < 2 holds.

3 n = 2 e7 gauge theories with fundamentals

in this section we consider four dimensional n = 2 supersymmetric e7 gauge theories with

massive fundamental hypermultiplets. since the fundamental representation (56) of e7

is pseudo-real, we can consider the case that these matter belong to half hypermultiplets.

as in the previous section, we can obtain the seiberg-witten geometries for these theories

using the toric data for e7 [16]. the point particle limit for this case is rather trivial than
the e6 case. the result with 2nf half hypermultiplets (nf  1

2 z) are

the geometry for nf = 1/2 case has been obtained in [7]. the deformation parameters

wi are written in terms of the casimirs invariants constructed from an n = 1 adjoint

chiral multiplet , and the explicit relation between them is given in [23]. note that in

[23] the polynomial of the weierstrass form

we7(x, y, z; w) = y2 + x3 + (z3 + w8z + w12)x + w2z4 + w6z3 + w10z2 + w14z + w18 (3.3)

if we consider the massive hypermultiplet, only the polynomial of degree twelve x 56

e7 (x, y, z; w, m) for the massive

should be modied in (3.1). below we will determine x 56

case. by giving appropriate vevs to the moduli, the geometry (3.1) should reduce to
the one describing e6 or so(12) gauge theory as in [24]. 4

first, we consider the reduction to the e6 gauge theory by removing the simple root 6.

for the notation for roots and weights we follow [25] and [24]. according to [24], by tuning
the higgs vector as ai = (m +a1, 2m +a2, 3m +a3, 5
2m +a6)
and taking the limit m  , we should obtain the e6 singularity. indeed by explicit

2m +a4, 2m +a5, 3

2m, 3

calculations, we nd that

we7(x, y, z; w) = (2m)6 we6(x, y , z; w(ai)) + o(m 5),

(3.6)

where

x = 4m 2x,

y = 8m 3y ,

z = 4mz

(3.7)

and we6 is given in (2.16). the fundamental representation 56 of e7 is decomposed into
the representation of e6  u(1) as

,

(3.8)

where the subscript denotes the u(1) charge 6  i. thus if we take m =  1
2 m + m, we
should obtain the seiberg-witten geometry for the e6 theory with fundamental matter

in the limit m  . this means that

x 56

e7 (x, y, z; w, m) = cm 6x 27

e6 (x, y , z; w, m) + o(m 5),

(3.9)

where x 27

e6 is proposed in [6] as

x 27

e6 (x, y, z; w, m) = m6+2w2m48m3z+(w2

212x)m2 +4mw54w2x8(z2 iy+w6/2),
(3.10)

and c is a constant.

next we consider the gauge symmetry breaking which yields the so(12) gauge theory
with spinors, by giving the vev ai = (2m, 3m + a5, 4m + a4, 3m + a3, 2m + a2, m +

4su (7) gauge theory can also be obtained in this way. but we will not consider this case because

actual computation is very dicult.

in terms of which the polynomial we7 describing the e7 singularity is represented as

wd6(x, y, z; w) = y2 + zx2 + z5 + v2z4 + v4z3 + v6z2 + +v8z + v10 + 2ixpf,

(3.13)

where b1 = a1, b2 = a2  a1, b3 = a3  a2, b4 = a4  a3, b5 = a5 + a6  a4

and b6 = a6  a5. the fundamental representation 56 of e7 is decomposed into the

representation of so(12)  u(1) as

56 = 320  101  101,

(3.15)

where the subscript denotes the u(1) charge 1  i. the indices of spinor representa-

tion 32 and fundamental representation 10 are eight and two, respectively. thus the

terms proportional to m l(5  l  12) in x 56

e7 must be absent after taking the coordi-
3) dened in (3.11). note that there is no need to shift the mass to make
the spinor matter survive. although this and the condition (3.9) impose very strong

nates (x

restrictions on the polynomial x 56

e7 (x, y, z; w, m), we can nd a unique solution. in the

(3.16)

and c = 1. note that if we take m = 0, x 56

e7 becomes a factorized form and agrees
with the massless case obtained from calabi-yau construction. in the semi-classical limit

e7  0, the low energy theory has singularities associated with massless squarks [6]
when

0 = m (m; wi)  det5656(m1  cl) = m56 + 432w2m54 +    .

(3.17)

in fact, the hypersurface dened by the intersection of x 56

e7 (x1, x2, x3; w, m) = 0 and
we7(x1, x2, x3; w) = 0 in c3 parametrized by (x1, x2, x3) becomes singular when wis
satisfy m = 0. this means that in the limit e7  0 the seiberg-witten geometry
becomes singular when m = 0. this fact can be regarded as a non-trivial check of the

validity of (3.16). it is straightforward to generalize (3.1) to the theory with fundamental

hypermultiplets with dierent masses.

we can also nd the seiberg-witten geometry for n = 2 so(12) gauge theory with

spinor matter from (3.16) and (3.11). indeed we obtain

x 56

e7 (x1, x2, x3; w; m) = m 4x 32

d6(x, y , z; v; m) + o(m 3),

(3.18)

where

(3.19)

taking m = m + m, which corresponds to the reduction to the so(12) gauge theory

with fundamental matter, we also obtain

x 56

e7 (x1, x2, x3; w; m) = 4m 10(m2  z) + o(m 9).

(3.20)

note that in the massless case, the polynomial x 32

d6 is factorized and agrees with that
obtained in [9]. it seems that the polynomials (3.16) and (3.19) cannot be derived from

conning phase superpotential technique because they have the term of odd degrees in

m.

4 discussion and conclusions

in this article, we have studied n = 2 supersymmetric e6 and e7 gauge theories with

fundamental matter. for the e7 theory, we have taken various decoupling limits such

that the e7 theory ows to the theories with smaller gauge groups, the exact solutions of

which have been already known. as a result, the e7 geometry proposed in section 3 was

shown to reduce exactly to the geometries expected from earlier works. this observation

serves as a non-trivial check of the validity of the original e7 geometry. furthermore, by

breaking the group e7 appropriately, we have also found the seiberg-witten geometry for

so(12) gauge theories with massive fundamentals and spinors.

we have analyzed the e6 gauge theories, by realizing them as decoupled theories

geometrically contained in type iia string theory compactied on singular calabi-yau

threefolds. although the seiberg-witten geometry for this theory has been already con-

structed from eld theoretical technique, it is meaningful to ascertain whether or not the

same geometry can be reproduced from local structure of calabi-yau manifolds. remark-

ably, we have found a complete agreement in the case of massless fundamental matter.

one of the disadvantages in using calabi-yau manifolds to determine the geometry

is that the masses for matter multiplets cannot be easily incorporated. as mentioned in

section 2, the matter multiplets are constrained on the extra singularities on the p1 base

of calabi-yau manifolds. in order to predict how the hypermultiplet masses modify the

seiberg-witten geometry from geometrical point of view, we presumably need to blow

up the calabi-yau at the extra singularities. at rst sight, however, it seems extremely

dicult to account for the intricate mass dependence such as (3.10), (3.16), and (3.19).

calabi-yau construction of gauge theories has another disadvantage that we cannot

realize gauge groups with arbitrarily large ranks. to overcome this diculty, we require

a more powerful framework, geometric engineering [3], which embeds gauge theories in

non-compact calabi-yau threefolds instead of compact ones. geometric engineering is

15

presumably the most systematic and general approach to the problem of nding seiberg-

witten geometries, even though there are several other methods which make use of branes,

such as brane probe and mqcd. it is probable that understanding full geometrical fea-

tures of string theories will enable us to investigate n = 2 supersymmetric theories with

arbitrary gauge groups and matter representations.
