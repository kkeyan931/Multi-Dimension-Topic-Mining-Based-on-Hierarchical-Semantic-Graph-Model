abstract

we present new analytic and numerical results for self-gravitating su(2)-
higgs magnetic monopoles approaching the black hole threshold. our investi-
gation extends to large higgs self-coupling, , a regime heretofore unexplored.
when  is small, the critical solution where a horizon rst appears is extremal
reissner-nordstrom outside the horizon but has a nonsingular interior. when
 is large, the critical solution is an extremal black hole with non-abelian hair
and a mass less than the extremal reissner-nordstrom value. the transition
between these two regimes is reminiscent of a rst-order phase transition. we
analyze in detail the approach to these critical solutions as the higgs expec-
tation value is varied, and compare this analysis with the numerical results.

i. introduction

the physics of a nonsingular spacetime is qualitatively distinct from a that of a space-
time exhibiting a black hole. however, families of spacetimes exist that may be viewed as
interpolating between the two. these spacetimes are nonsingular and have no horizons;
nevertheless, they have a region whose metric can be made arbitrarily close to that of the
exterior region of a black hole. in the limiting case, the inner boundary of this region takes
on the characteristics of an extremal horizon, even though no curvature singularity develops
in the interior. by studying such solutions, one may gain further insight into the properties
of black holes.

one approach to the construction of such almost black holes begins with a sponta-
neously broken yang-mills theory that has magnetic monopole solutions. for small higgs
expectation values, these monopole solutions persist when gravitational eects are included.
however, as the higgs expectation value is increased toward a critical value on the order of
the planck mass, the monopole solutions begin to approximate black holes with nite mass
and nonzero horizon radius.

such gravitating monopoles, as well as the related magnetically charged black holes with
hair, have been studied previously [15]. for a review article and recent work in related
subjects, see [6]. in this paper we investigate these solutions in more detail, concentrating on
some aspects that were not previously noted. most notably, we nd that two distinct types
of behavior, with qualitatively dierent extremal black hole limits, can occur. our focus
here is on the detailed properties of these solutions and their behavior as they approach the
black hole limit. we describe elsewhere [7] how these solutions can be used as approximate
black holes that provide insight into the transition from a nonsingular spacetime to one with
horizons.

we work in the context of an su(2) gauge theory that is spontaneously broken to u(1)
by a triplet higgs eld  with vacuum expectation value hi = v. the elementary particle
spectrum of this theory contains a pair of vector mesons w  that carry u(1) electric charge
and have mass ev (where e is the gauge coupling), as well as a massless photon and a
massive electrically neutral higgs particle. in at space the classical eld equations have
a spherically symmetric monopole solution with u(1) magnetic charge 4/e and a mass of
order 4v/e. this has a central core region, of radius rcore  1/mw , in which there are
nontrivial matter elds. beyond this radius is a coulomb region in which the massive
elds fall o exponentially fast, leaving only a long-range coulomb magnetic eld.

in studying the behavior of these solutions in the presence of gravity, we assume spherical

symmetry, and so can write the metric in the form

ds2 = b(r)dt2  a(r)dr2  r2(d2 + sin2 d2) .

it is often convenient to rewrite a in terms of a mass function m(r) dened by

with m()  m. for a conguration to be nonsingular at the origin, a(0) = 1 and
m(0) = 0. a horizon occurs when 1/a has a zero or, equivalently, when m(r)/r = 1/2g.

a benchmark with which to compare our results is provided by the reissner-nordstrom

if m > qq2/4g, this describes a black hole solution with a charge (either magnetic or
m < qq2/4g, there is no horizon separating the curvature singularity at r = 0 from
regimes, m = qq2/4g, gives the extremal reissner-nordstrom black hole. for q = 4/e,

when v  mpl the gravitational eects on the monopole are relatively small. the metric
at large distances approaches the reissner-nordstrom form, with qq2/4g  m. there is
r < rcore. one nds that 1/a = 1 at the origin, decreases to a minimum at a radius of

no singularity, because the actual metric deviates from the reissner-nordstrom form when

order rcore, and then increases monotonically. as v is increased, the core shrinks and the
minimum of 1/a moves inward and becomes deeper. in most cases, this continues until 1/a
develops a double zero, corresponding to an extremal horizon, when v = vcr. a slightly
dierent behavior is found for very small higgs self-coupling [3]. in this case, the solution
varies continuously as v is increased up to a value vmax. although the minimum value of
1/a is still nonzero at this point, static solutions do not exist for higher values of v. instead,
these solutions join smoothly on to a second branch of solutions for which (1/a)min decreases
as v is decreased from vmax to a critical value vcr, where the extremal horizon develops.

for small values of the higgs mass, the extremal horizon of the critical solution occurs at
the reissner-nordstrom radius r0, in the exterior coulomb region of the monopole solution.
the matter elds take on their vacuum value everywhere outside the horizon and the exterior
metric is exactly that of an extremal reissner-nordstrom black hole. when the higgs to
vector mass ratio is greater than about 12, a regime not explored in depth in previous studies,
the behavior is rather dierent. the horizon in the monopole core at a radius r < r0 that
decreases with increasing higgs mass.
in this case there are nontrivial matter elds, or
hair, outside the horizon. the transition between the two regimes is not smooth, but
instead is reminiscent of a rst order transition.

the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. in sec. ii we outline the general
formalism and dene our conventions.
in sec. iii we use numerical methods to obtain
monopole solutions to the eld equations. we describe in detail their behavior as v is
increased towards its critical value. the critical solutions that are the limits of these families
of monopole solutions are characterized by the presence of extremal horizons. in sec. iv,
we use analytic methods to study the properties of these critical solutions, focusing on the
behavior near the horizon. we show that the problem of nding a solution with an extremal
horizon can be formulated as a pair of boundary value problems, one for the region 0 < r < r
and one for r < r < , that must be solved simultaneously. the conditions for a solution
to these places strong constraints on the behavior of the elds near the horizon. these
constraints allow only two types of behavior, one associated with a core region horizon, the
other with a coulomb region horizon, which we examine in detail in sec. v. in sec. vi we
compare these analytic predictions with our numerical results. section vii contains some
concluding remarks. the appendix contains details of the numerical investigation of the
transition region between the two types of critical solutions.

ii. general formalism

we consider an su(2) gauge theory with a triplet higgs eld a whose self-interactions

are governed by the scalar eld potential

v () =



2 (cid:16)aa  v2(cid:17)2

.

(2.1)

in at spacetime, this theory has nonsingular monopole solutions, with magnetic charge
4/e, that are described by the spherically symmetric ansatz

a = vrah(r)
aia = iak rk 1  u(r)
a0a = 0 .

er

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

while it is clear that vh(r) is the magnitude of the higgs eld, the meaning of u(r) is some-
what obscured by this radial gauge ansatz. by applying a singular gauge transformation
that makes the direction of the higgs eld uniform, one nds that u(r)/er is equal to the
magnitude of the massive vector eld, and so it, like 1  h(r), should be expected to vanish
exponentially fast outside the monopole core.

the generalization of this ansatz to curved spacetime is straightforward. since we are
considering only static spherically symmetric solutions, we can take the metric to be of the
form of eq. (1.1). the matter part of the action is

smatter = 4z dt dr r2ab"k(u, h)

one may view u(u, h) as a position-dependent potential. it has several stationary points,

which we enumerate here for later reference:

1. u = 0, h = 1. this is a local minimum of u for r > 1/ev.
2. u = u(r), h = h(r), or u = u(r), h = h(r), where

u = s (1  e2v2r2)
h = s   e2/(evr)2

(2.6)

(2.7)

these are real only for r lying between 1/ev and 1/ v. in that range it is a minimum
of u if /e2 > 1, but a saddle point if /e2 < 1. if /e2 = 1, this solution is replaced
by a degenerate set of local minima, with h2 + u2 = 1, that exist only for evr = 1.

3. u = h = 0. this is never a local minimum of u.

4. u = 1, h = 0. this is a local minimum of u for r < 1/ v.

we will see that these stationary points are key to understanding the local existence of
extremal horizons in monopole systems.

note that, up to a rescaling of distances, the solutions of these equations depend only on
the dimensionless parameters1 a = 8gv2 and b = /e2 = (mh /2mw )2.

1these parameters are related to those in ref. [1] by  = a, in ref. [2] by  = 2b and  = a, and

in ref. [3] by  = pa/2 and  = 2b.

integration of eq. (2.10) gives b(r) in terms of the remaining functions. with the
boundary condition a()b() = 1, corresponding to the conventional normalization of t,
we have

b(r) =

exp(cid:20)16gz

dr rk(cid:21) .

(2.12)

using this result to eliminate b(r) from the remaining eld equations leaves one rst-order
and two second-order equations to be solved. a solution of these is determined by ve
boundary conditions. requiring that the elds be nonsingular at the origin gives three of
these, u(0) = 1, h(0) = 0, and a(0) = 1. two more, u() = 0 and h() = 1, follow from
the niteness of the energy. additional boundary conditions arise when a horizon is present.
while these are not relevant for our numerical solutions, which are all regular monopoles,
they play an important role in our analysis of the extremal black hole congurations that
are the limiting points of sequences of monopole solutions.

iii. monopole solutions

a. the method

in our search for regular solutions and their approach to criticality, let us identify an en-
ergy functional on the space of static congurations. following van nieuwenhuizen, wilkin-
son, and perry [8], one can write down an action which is a functional of just u(r) and h(r) by
not only eliminating ab using eq. (2.10), but also eliminating a by integrating eq. (2.11)
subject to the boundary condition a(0) = 1. the complete action (i.e., gravitational plus
matter) then becomes

s = z dt e
e = 4z

+ r2ab"k(u, h)

(3.1)

+ u(u, h)#) .

with ab and a understood to be implicit functionals of u(r) and h(r). congurations
that extremize this action are solutions to eqs. (2.8)-(2.11), with the energy e being equal
to the mass m = m() [8]. this energy functional is not bounded from below, even when
satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions, unless the 1/a(r) that corresponds to a given
matter eld conguration {u(r), h(r)} is everywhere greater than zero. this restriction is
not serious for our purposes, since we are only interested in static regular monopole solutions
and their approach to criticality; all such solutions satisfy the condition that 1/a(r) > 0
everywhere.

thus, we nd regular solutions to the eld equations by seeking extrema of this energy
functional that satisfy the boundary conditions at r = 0 and r = . this is equivalent to

solving e/u = e/h = 0. we do this numerically by solving the alternative system of
equations

for an appropriate damping factor  and taking the nal steady state solution as the result.
this approach is analogous to having a massive particle roll on a manifold determined by
e while the particles motion is viscously damped, eventually coming to rest at some local
minimum of the energy.

the discretization used to numerically implement this algorithm places a limit on how
close we can approach the critical solutions in which the extremal horizon has actually
formed. the errors in the elds are proportional to the square of the spatial step size. as
a result is that we can only obtain solutions in which the minimum value of 1/a is at least
o[(r)2].

one should contrast our relaxation method with the algorithms used in previous analyses
[13] that employ shooting from the origin. in these, a choice is made for the values of the
elds and their rst spatial derivatives at the origin, and the equations of motion are then
used to integrate out towards innity. the initial choice is then adjusted to ensure that the
boundary conditions at innity are satised. with this approach, diculties appear with
large b because of the extreme sensitivity at the origin to small perturbations. no such
problem exists with relaxation, and as a result we have been able to obtain solutions for
large b. however, although solutions that are unstable under perturbations may be found
by shooting, such solutions cannot be obtained by our relaxation method.

in particular, previous work [3] has shown that for b < 0.1 monopole solutions exist for

a range of values of a that are greater than the value acr of the critical solution. moreover,
for each value of a in this range there are two solutions, with the one having the smaller
value of (1/a)min being unstable [9,10]. hence, for this range of b our methods cannot nd
the critical limit of the regular monopole solutions.

b. approach to criticality: lowb case

we investigate the approach to criticality by studying the nature of the monopole so-
lutions as a = 8gv2 is increased with the higgs self-coupling held xed. two distinct
behaviors are seen, depending on the size of b = /e2. we will describe the low-b behavior
in detail in this subsection, and the high-b behavior in the next. figure 1 illustrates the
behavior for b = 1.0, a typical low-b case. as a increases and gravitational eects become
stronger, 1/a(r) begins to dip down until at a = acr it develops a double zero, corresponding
to an extremal horizon, at r = r0, the horizon radius of the extremal reissner-nordstrom
solution. at the same time, the matter elds u(r) and h(r) are pulled inward. at a = acr,
the variation of these elds occurs entirely within the horizon. only the abelian coulomb

magnetic eld survives outside the horizon, while the metric for r  r0 is precisely that of
the extremal reissner-nordstrom black hole.

all of this reproduces results found in earlier work [14]. some features that were not
previously stressed are revealed when we examine b(r). coming in from large r, b decreases
with 1/a until the latter reaches its minimum. b then continues to decrease, although at a
much smaller rate. for very small b this decrease continues all the way in to r = 0, while
for somewhat larger values of b there is a minimum in b at a nite r < r0. the situation
for the critical solution is somewhat ambiguous. if we adopt the conventional normalization
b() = 1, then b(r) vanishes identically inside the horizon. if instead we set b(0) = 1,
then b is nite and varying inside the horizon and innite outside the horizon, with a
minimum either at r = 0 or at some nite radius, depending on the value of b. in neither
case is the minimum a zero of b.
closely related to this is the behavior of ab. when a is small, this is very nearly
constant, with a value close to unity. as a is increased, ab develops a step-like behavior
until, at criticality, it is precisely a step function centered at the horizon. this is in sharp
contrast with the schwarzschild and reissner-nordstrom solutions, where ab = 1 every-
where. to show how this behavior becomes more pronounced as the solution approaches
criticality, in figure 2 we plot the value of ab at the origin as a function of (1/a)min for
b = 16. note that there is a power law relationship between the two. similar curves, but
with dierent powers, are found throughout the low-b regime.

as a nal illustration of the behavior of the low-b solutions near criticality, in fig. 3 we
plot u for several near-critical solutions. however, rather than using the variable r, we have
plotted u as a function of the proper length

we see that, for suciently large l, u(l) is close to a decaying exponential, and that this
behavior does not signicantly change as one crosses the minimum of 1/a; similar behavior
is seen with 1  h.

c. approach to criticality: highb case

the scenario when b is large diers signicantly from that for small b; we illustrate this
in fig. 4 for the case of b = 100. so long as a is not too near its critical value, the qualitative
evolution of the metric functions and eld variables is similar to that in the previous case:
1/a(r) dips down in a region r  r0, the value of b(r) decreases in a region near the origin,
and the elds u, h are drawn into the core of the system.
near criticality, a dierent behavior emerges. the evolution of 1/a(r) as the solution
approaches criticality is depicted in fig. 4a and, in more detail, in fig. 5. although initially
similar to that the for the low-b case, the decrease of the minimum at r  r0 ceases before
it actually reaches zero. as this occurs, a second minimum at a radius r < r0 rapidly
drops down and forms a double zero, corresponding to an extremal horizon, at r = r < r0.
figure 4b (and, in more detail, fig. 6) shows the function b(r) as a approaches its critical
value. in contrast to the small-b case, in the critical limit the minimum of b is a zero located
at the horizon, r = r.
the evolution of ab is shown in fig. 4c. the behavior is similar to that for the small-
b case until the outer minimum of 1/a stops decreasing and the inner minimum begins to

appear. until this point, there is a power-law relationship between ab|r=0 and (1/a)min
similar to that for the small-b case, with most of the variation in ab occurring at r  r0.
once the inner minimum begins to appear, the decrease in ab|r=0 slows down, so that
even for the critical solution ab|r=0 6= 0.

figure 4d depicts the matter elds u(r) and h(r) for a series of values of a at xed
large b. their behavior is analogous to that for small b except that the elds are never
completely drawn into the region r < r0; the degree to which they are drawn into this
region is dictated by the value of 1/a at the outer minimum at criticality. the smaller that
minimum value of 1/a, the more contained the matter elds are. since they have nontrivial
elds outside the horizon the critical solutions for large b are examples of extremal black
holes with non-abelian hair.

the qualitative picture diers somewhat when b > 400, in that the 1/a always has only

a single minimum. one may think of the sequence of monopole solutions here as largeb
solutions in which the inner minimum of 1/a drops out suciently early that no double
minimum solutions exist. to illustrate this, in fig. 7 we show the approach to criticality for
b = 1000.

d. behavior of the critical solutions

the critical solutions themselves are not accessible through our numerical method. nev-
ertheless, we can obtain good approximations to these by following sequences of regular
monopole solutions. here we briey summarize how some of the properties inferred from
these numerical solutions vary with b.

as we have already noted, the critical solutions for small b have horizons at the reissner-
nordstrom radius r0, while for large b the horizon occurs at a value r < r0 (see fig. 8).
there is a discontinuity in passing from the low-b to the high-b regime: the critical solution
does not continuously vary from one type to the other, but instead undergoes something
like a rst-order transition. for a value of b just below the transition, an inner minimum
appears2 at a radius r < r0, while 1/a has a double zero at r0. as b increases, the inner
minimum rapidly descends and at the transition 1/a has two degenerate minima, one at
r < r0 and the other at r0. as b increases further the outer minimum moves upward, while
the inner minimum at r remains at zero. eventually the outer minimum vanishes, and the
only minimum in 1/a is associated with the horizon at r. this radius r asymptotes to
zero as b  . as b is increased, the critical black hole solution approaches that found in
the literature in the innite b limit [3,5].

2this inner minimum in low-b monopole solutions only appears for b very close to the transition
point and when a is very near acr.

fig. 10. critical values for a  1 as function of b. the inset shows in detail the transition
region between low-b and high-b behavior, with the open circle indicating the apparent transition
point at b = 40. note that at this point a = 1.4187 < 1.5, the latter value indicated by the dotted
line. the dashed line is an extension of the high-b type critical solutions to smaller b. for the
solutions represented by this dashed line, the elds are well-behaved inside the horizon, but are
not asymptotically at at spatial innity.

the mass of the critical solution can be inferred from the long-range behavior of 1/a. in
fig. 9 we plot this mass as a function of b. as expected, the mass of the low-b solutions is
just that of an extremal reissner-nordstrom black hole. however, in the high-b regime the
mass of the critical solution is less than the extremal reissner-nordstrom value m0. the
mass decreases with increasing b, and appears to have an asymptotic value of about 0.990.
note that there is no discontinuity in the mass in going from the low-b to the high-b regime.
finally, fig. 10 shows acr as a function of b. the critical value acr is always of order unity
and is a monotonically decreasing function of b. this can be understood by recalling that
the mass of the at space monopole increases (by a factor of 1.8) as the ratio of the higgs
mass to the vector mass varies varies from zero to innity. stated dierently, the value of
v needed to achieve a given mass decreases with increasing higgs mass, making it plausible
that the critical v should decrease in a similar fashion.

for large b there appears to be a power-law relationship between b and acr  1. that
acr  1 as b   is consistent with observations made in past investigations [35]. the
literature also [3] indicates that the curve should asymptote to acr  3.94 as b  0. the kink
in the data at b  40 is real and reects the transition between the small and large b regimes.
note that acr < 1.5 at this transition point; this fact will be of importance later. the dashed
curve in the inset of fig. 10 shows an extension of the high-b type critical solutions into the

15

low-b regime. the corresponding solutions are well behaved inside the horizon, but are not
asymptotically at at spatial innity; see the appendix for more details.

iv. analytic constraints from extremal horizons

we would now like to use analytic methods to gain some deeper understanding of our
numerical results. we begin by focusing on the critical solutions with extremal horizons,
but regular at the origin, that are the limits of the gravitating monopole solutions. in this
section we will obtain a set of conditions at the extremal horizon that are necessary, although
not sucient, for the existence of such solutions. these turn out to allow two distinct types
of limiting solutions. we discuss both of these, as well as the nearby nearby nonsingular
solutions, in more detail in the next section. our analysis of the behavior of the elds near
the horizon complements and extends earlier treatments [4,11].

because a simultaneous zero of both 1/a and its rst derivative is a singular point of the
dierential eqs. (2.8) and (2.9), the critical solutions are nonanalytic at the horizon radius
r. ordinarily, physical considerations would constrain the allowable singularities at such
a point. however, we are not actually requiring that the solution be physically acceptable,
but only that it be the limiting point of a family of physically acceptable solutions. keeping
this in mind, it seems reasonable to impose the following set of requirements:

1. we assume that the functions u, h, 1/a, and b are all nite and continuous at r.

2. since r is a singular coordinate at the horizon, we should not assume that the deriva-
tives of these functions with respect to r are continuous, or even nite, at r. instead,
we require only that d(1/a)/dr vanishes at the horizon and that du/dr and dh/dr
diverge less rapidly than a1/2 does.

3. we assume that the leading singularities of these quantities near the horizon can be
approximated by (not necessarily integer) powers of |r  r|, although we allow for the
possibility that both the power and the coecient of the leading term may be dierent
on opposite sides of the horizon.

given these assumptions, eqs. (2.8) and (2.9) imply that the matter elds at the horizon,
which we denote by u and h, must lie at one of the stationary points of u that were
enumerated in sec. ii. once these are specied, r is determined by eq. (2.11), which reduces
to

0 = 1  8gr2

u(r) .

(4.1)

the monopole solutions without horizons were solutions to a boundary value problem
with conditions imposed at r = 0 and r = . the existence of the extremal horizon imposes
three more conditions (on the values of u, h, and 1/a at r = r) and thus leads to a pair of
boundary value problems, one for the interval 0  r  r and one for r  r < , that must
be solved simultaneously. the interior problem has three boundary conditions at the origin

16

and three at the horizon, for a total of six, while the exterior has two at spatial innity and
three at the horizon, giving ve in all.

a standard approach to such problems is to look for a family of solutions obeying the
if these can be shown to depend on n adjustable
conditions at one of the boundaries.
parameters, integration of these solutions will (assuming no singularities intervene) give an
n-parameter family of solutions in the neighborhood of the other boundary. generically,
a necessary, although not sucient, condition for a solution is that n be greater than or
equal to the number of conditions imposed at the second boundary. thus, at rst thought
it would seem that, given a suitable set of values for u, h, and r, we would need a two-
parameter family of solutions as r  r  0+ to solve the exterior boundary value problem
and a three-parameter family for r  r  0 to solve the interior problem. however, we do
not expect to nd extremal solutions for arbitrary values of parameters. instead, for xed
b we must adjust v (or, equivalently, a) to its critical value. we may therefore view v as an
extra adjustable parameter, and need only require the existence of two-parameter families
of solutions on both sides of the horizon. the nonanalyticity at the horizon allows us to
choose the parameters on the two sides independently.

there are several caveats. first, the presence of the appropriate number of adjustable
parameters at the horizon does not guarantee the existence of a solution. global consider-
ations that are beyond the scope of this analysis may make it impossible to satisfy all of
the boundary conditions. second, it may, and in some cases does, happen that the leading
behavior near the horizon is xed and that the adjustable parameters appear only in sub-
dominant terms. finally, if the values of u and h at the horizon are the same as at the origin
(innity), the interior (exterior) boundary value problem for the matter elds has a trivial
solution, and so it is not necessary to have any adjustable parameters.

equation (2.11) and the equations obtained by substitution of eq. (2.10) into eqs. (2.8)
and (2.9) form a set of three equations for the functions u, h, and 1/a. in the notation we

here primes denote derivatives with respect to x, while the ellipses represent terms, of higher

we are assuming that the leading behavior of the various functions can be approximated

by powers of x. it is then fairly easy to show3 that

(4.11)

we now turn to the behavior of  as x  0. we see that  must vanish at least as fast
as |x|1/2, since otherwise the nonlinear term on the left-hand side of the equation dominates
and there is no solution. hence, we may write

3assume that 1/a  |x|. if  > 2, eq. (4.7) is dominated by the two terms not involving 1/a,
and one nds that   |x|1/2. this in turn implies that eq. (4.6) is dominated by a single term,
the rst one on the right hand side, and hence has no solution. if instead  < 2, the two terms
involving 1/a dominate eq. (4.7), again implying that   |x|1/2. equation (4.6) is now dominated
by the three terms on the left hand side. because the last two of these cancel, there is again no
solution.

(4.13)

where  is equal to plus or minus unity according to whether x is negative or positive (i.e.,
for the interior and exterior problems, respectively). a solution is possible only if 1/2 is
proportional to one of the eigenvectors of m. let us denote this eigenvector by k and the
orthogonal eigenvector by , with analogous conventions for the eigenvalues. we thus have

with p obeying

1/2 = pk

4

p2(cid:21) = kp .

in addition, substitution of our expansion for  into eq. (4.10) yields

k(cid:20)1  


4

p2(cid:21) = f + kp2 .

(4.14)

(4.15)

(4.16)

these equations can be used to nd k as a function of p2, and the result then substituted

back into eq. (4.15). for the interior solution ( = 1), this leads to the result that

p2

and

or

p2

(4.17)

kint =

(4.18)

since k must be positive, we require that f > 0. the requirement that p be real then implies
that nonzero solutions for p exist only if k  f/4; for the solution with the lower choice
of sign, there is the additional requirement that k not lie between 0 and 3f/4.

although eqs. (4.15) and (4.16) allow a nontrivial solution for p2 in the exterior region,

other constraints, described below, require that

and hence that

p2

kext = f .

(4.20)

having determined 1/2, we can now turn to the remaining terms in eq. (4.12). extract-
ing the coecients of the integral powers of x in eq. (4.10) yields a series of inhomogeneous
linear equations that determine the n; the rst of these is4

(2k  m)1  kp2 

2 h2(cid:16)t

k1(cid:17) k + 1i =  .

(4.21)

in a similar fashion, the nonanalytic o(|x|j ) terms give a linear equation for j . how-
ever, because the inhomogeneous term in eq. (4.10) is analytic and cannot contribute, the
resulting equation is homogeneous. a solution of this equation is possible only if j
is
proportional to one of the a and if j is a root of

0 = k(cid:20)( + 1) 
0 = k(cid:20)( + 1)

p2(cid:21)  k ,
p2(cid:21)   ,

1/2  k

(4.22)

note that both equations take the same form in the p2 = 0 case, where the two a are on the
same footing. because the equation is homogeneous, j is determined only up to an overall
multiplicative constant.
in order that the solution near the horizon have two adjustable
constants, there must be two independent nonanalytic terms with powers greater than 1/2.
thus, the pair of equations corresponding to the two a must, between them, have two roots
greater than 1/2.

for p = 0, the coecient of  in eq. (4.22) is positive, implying that at least one  must
be negative for each a. in order to have two roots positive and greater than 1/2, we must
require that both eigenvalues satisfy

a >

3f
4

> 0 ,

p = 0 .

(4.23)

for p 6= 0, the form of eq. (4.22) depends on whether we are considering the mode
proportional to k or the one proportional to . in either case, it is most convenient to
proceed by using eq. (4.15) to eliminate a. for  = 1 the coecient of  is positive, so
at least one root is negative for each mode. detailed examination of the equation for the k
mode then shows that it has no roots greater than 1/2; since the equation for the  mode
can have at most one such, we must set p = 0 in the exterior region. for  = 1 (i.e., the
interior region), the equation for the k mode has one and only root greater than 1/2 for

4the coecient of 1 on the left hand side of this equation vanishes for certain choices of pa-
rameters, leaving 1 undetermined. a similar phenomenon can also happen in the equations for
the other n. these parameter choices correspond to points where the power j of one of the
nonanalytic terms goes through an integer value.

20

all values of k consistent with the reality of p. the equation for the other mode can be
rewritten as

0 = (cid:18)

(cid:19) .

(4.24)

for this to have a solution with  > 1/2, either k <  or k < 0; since we will see that at
most one of the a can be negative, the second alternative implies the rst. combining this
with the previous conditions on the a, we see that a p 6= 0 solution exists in the interior
region if

 > k > 

f
4

,

p 6= 0 .

(4.25)

equations (4.23) and (4.25), together with the condition f > 0, are the fundamental
conditions that must be satised at the extremal horizon. to explore the various possibilities,
we must apply these in turn to the stationary points of u that were enumerated in sec. ii.
the last two cases can be immediately eliminated: case 3 is excluded because both a < 0,
thus ruling out the possibility of a p = 0 exterior solution, while case 4 has f < 0. this
leaves cases 1 and 2. the former, u = 0 and h = 1, corresponds to an extremal horizon
in the coulomb region while the latter, u = u and h = h, gives a horizon in the monopole
core.5 we will study these in detail in the next section.

v. behavior near coulomb and core region extremal

horizons

in sec. iv we showed that there are only two possibilities for the values of the elds at
the extremal horizon. although the local analysis that we used cannot tell whether these
are consistent with the existence of a global solution, our numerical results show that both
types of solution actually occur. in this section we examine these more closely. we also
consider the nonsingular near-critical solutions in which 1/a has a related minimum.

a. coulomb region horizons

the rst possibility, u = 0, h = 1, corresponds to a horizon in the coulomb region
outside the monopole core. equation (4.1) implies that r = r0, the extremal reissner-
nordstrom value, so  = f = 1. the matrix m is diagonal, with eigenvalues

1 = m11 = (evr0)2  1 =

a
2  1

5since it seems unlikely that the minimum energy solutions will have either u or h change sign,
we assume that the elds are positive at the horizon. there can, however, be excited monopoles
in which u(r) goes through a zero; see, e.g., ref. [3].

21

2 = m22 = 4v2r2

0 = 2ba .

(5.1)

a solution outside the horizon is given by the extremal reissner-nordstrom metric, with
u = 0 and h = 1 for all r > r0. we assume that this is the only exterior solution satisfying
the boundary conditions, and concentrate on the interior solution.

there are several possibilities for the behavior of elds just inside the horizon:

type i: the singularity in the matter elds is less singular than x1/2 (i.e., p = 0). equa-
tion (4.18) implies that k = 1, so near the horizon

u = cu|x|u + ux +   
h = 1  ch|x|h  hx +   
1
= x2 +   
a

(5.2)

where the ellipses represent terms that are determined by the terms shown explicitly. here u
and h denote constants whose values are xed by eq. (4.21). cu and ch are not determined
locally, but must instead be adjusted so the boundary conditions at the origin are satised.
the exponents u and h are solutions of eq. (4.22) and, depending on the values of a and
b, may or may not be greater than unity. the requirement that these exponents both be
greater than 1/2 leads to eq. (4.23), which implies that

a > max (cid:20) 7

2

,

3

8b(cid:21) .

(5.3)

type ii: matter elds with |x|1/2 singularities. there are two possibilities here, depending
on which eld has the singularity. in the rst (type iia),

u = p|x|1/2 + cu|x|u + ux +   
h = 1  ch|x|h  hx +   
1
= kx2 +   
a

while in the second (type iib),

u = cu|x|u + ux +   
h = 1  pa|x|1/2  ch|x|h  hx +   
1
= kx2 +   
a

(5.5)

(5.6)

(5.7)

with k equal to the lesser of the two eigenvalues in eq. (5.1). if 2 < a < 7/2, the upper
sign must be used in eq. (5.7). for type iia solutions eq. (4.25) requires that either

or

2

and b <

1

the corresponding requirement for type iib is that

a >

2

1  4b

> 2

and b <

1
4

.

(5.8)

(5.9)

(5.10)

at the boundary between the iia and iib regimes, a = 2/(1  4b), both u and h are equal
to 1/2 and the two types of solutions merge. note that none of these solutions is possible
if a < 3/2; this point will be important when we compare this analysis to the numerical
results.

the most important dierence between the type i and the type ii solutions is in the

behavior of the quantity ab. if p 6= 0, one of the matter elds varies as |x|1/2 near the
horizon. as a result, the integral in the exponent in eq. (2.12) diverges for any r < r0,
and ab becomes a step function centered at the horizon. horowitz and ross [12] have
shown that a particle in geodesic motion across a horizon feels a tidal force proportional to
the logarithmic derivative of ab, and have used the term naked black holes to describe
certain near-extremal black holes solutions for which this quantity is large. not only do our
coulomb region extremal solutions t in this category, but so do the nearby nonsingular
solutions.

b. horizons in the monopole core

the second possibility allowed by the analysis of sec. iv is that u = u(r) and
h = h(r), with u and h given by eqs. (2.6) and (2.7). this corresponds to a horizon
in the monopole core region. unlike the case of a coulomb region horizon, there must be a
nontrivial exterior solution, thus giving an extremal black hole with higgs and gauge boson
hair. because our numerical results show solutions of this type only for relatively large val-
ues of b, we will nd it convenient to use large-b expansions to simplify some of the algebra
below.

substituting the expressions for u and h into the potential u gives
(evr)2h1 + 2b(evr)2  b(evr)4i .

8gr2u =

a

2(b  1)

(5.11)

equation (4.1) requires that this be equal to unity at the horizon. by making use of the
fact that (evr)2 = a/2, this constraint can be rewritten as

23

b =

4(1  )

a2  4a + 4

.

(5.12)

the roots of this equation determine a in terms of b and . for large b, the b-dependence is
negligible, and

a = 2h1 
obeyed by u and h, it can be written as

1  1i + o(1/b) .

in contrast with the previous case, the matrix m is not diagonal. using the equations

(5.15)

(5.16)

the exterior solution must be of the p = 0 type, implying that these eigenvalues must

obey eq. (4.23). this requires that they both be greater than 3f/4, where

2

a + o(1/b) .

(5.18)

we also obtain the requirement b > 1, since otherwise m has a negative eigenvalue. since
a and  are also related by eq. (5.13), we can obtain a constraint that depends only on .
to satisfy both eqs. (5.13) and (5.18), we must take the upper sign in eq. (5.13). we can
then combine the two conditions to obtain

62 

41
15

  4 + o(1/b) > 0

24

(5.19)

which implies that  > 1.06 + o(1/b). note in particular that  = 1 (i.e., r = r0) is not
possible for any value of b.

once this condition is satised, there are no further constraints imposed by local analysis
at the horizon. in particular, the interior solution can be either of the p = 0 or the p 6= 0
type. because m is not diagonal, as it was in the coulomb case, the same irrational powers
appear in both u and h. thus, if p = 0, the elds near the horizon behave as

may be either greater or less than unity, depending on the values of a and b. the constants

a are determined by the eigenvectors a. the values of u and h are xed and are
the same on both sides of the horizon, while c1 and c2 can be varied independently inside
and outside the horizon so that the boundary conditions can be satised both at the origin
and at spatial innity.

if instead p 6= 0, the elds outside the horizon are as in eq. (5.20), but inside the horizon

we have assumed that 2 < 1; if the opposite were the case, the |x|1/2 terms would involve
qu

solutions. as before, the values of u and h are determined, although they are no longer
the same as in the external solution.

vi. comparison with numerical results

let us now see how well these analytic results agree with our numerical results. we
begin with the low-b regime, where the nonsingular monopole solutions tend toward a critical
solution with a coulomb region horizon at the reissner-nordstrom value r = r0. throughout
this regime, the critical solutions we nd appear to be the more singular type ii solutions
rather than the type i solutions of eq. (5.2). this is consistent with our nding (see
fig. 10) that the values of acr are always less than the lower bound for type i solutions
given in eq. (5.3).

given the values for acr as a function of b, eqs. (5.8) and (5.10) predict that there should
be a transition at b  0.1 between the type iia regime, where u  |x|1/2 and the type iib
regime, where 1  h has the |x|1/2 singularity. at b = 0.1, the lowest b for which we have a
sequence of stable congurations that approaches a critical black hole solution, we nd that
the powers of u and 1 h are both close to 1/2, as predicted for this transition. it is curious

25

to note that this is close to the value of b below which (1/a)min can be a double-valued
function a.

examining the coulomb-type black hole solutions in more detail, we nd, for b < 20,
that as r approaches r0 from below, the values of d2(a1)/dx2 and u2/x tend toward the
values of k and p predicted by eqs. (5.6) and (5.7) with the upper choice of sign.

we observed in sec. iiib that the matter elds displayed exponential fallos when written
as functions of the proper length l(r) for low-b type solutions. to understand this, we note
that the eld equation for u, eq. (2.8), can be written as

d2u

dl2 +"d(a1/2)

dr

+

8grk

a # du

dl

=

u(u2  1)

r2

+ e2v2uh2 .

(6.1)

our analytic results indicate that the quantity in square brackets is of order unity as x  0
for the interior portion of the extremal solution. this suggests that this quantity should be
a relatively slowly varying function for large l and hence that the fallo of u should behave
as a decaying exponential with a slowly-varying decay constant. as we saw in fig. 3, this is
indeed the case both for the critical and the near-critical solutions. a similar analysis can
be applied to 1  h.

from this point of view, the vanishing of u and 1  h at the extremal horizon is a
simple consequence of the fact that l(r0) = . this analysis also tells us how these elds
should behave as the critical solution is approached. we concentrate here on u, and restrict
ourselves to the range of b where u  |x|1/2 in the critical solution. near r, the minimum of
1/a, we can write6

1
a  c2

1(r  r)2 + 2 .

substituting this into eq. (3.3), we nd that

l  l(r)  c1

1

ln(1/) .

writing u as a decreasing exponential, u  u0 exp(c2l), we then have

u(r)  u0(1/a)q

min

(6.2)

(6.3)

(6.4)

with q = c2/2c1. this analysis does not give predictions for c1 and c2. however, we can get an
indication of what to expect for q by recalling that for the critical ( = 0) case u  (1/a)1/4
as the horizon is approached from the inside. if the above expressions were exact and c1 and
c2 were truly constant and independent of , this would imply that q = 1/4. turning to

6note that c2
1 cannot be the same as the coecient k that appears in the critical solution, since the
second derivative of 1/a has a discontinuity at the horizon of the critical solution, but is continuous
when  6= 0.

26

our numerical results, we do indeed see a power law behavior for u, with q ranging between
0.23 and 0.28.
a similar analysis can be applied to the jump in ab near the minimum of 1/a. for the
parameter ranges where we nd extremal solutions with p 6= 0, this predicts that ab r=0
assuming a normalization of ab r= = 1. not only does this account
varies as (1/a)p2/4
for the power law behavior noted in sec. iiib, but the predictions for the power are borne
out by the data within the numerical accuracy, where the power p2/4 ranges from about 0.7
to unity.

min

near b = 20, acr equals 3/2, the lower bound allowed by the analysis of the previous
section for coulomb-type solution. nevertheless, the qualitative nature of the approach to
criticality does not change as b increases past this value and as acr becomes smaller than 3/2.
indeed, the transition to core-type horizons does not appear to occur until about b = 40,
where acr = 1.4187. it does not seem as if this discrepancy can be attributed simply to
numerical errors. we nd that changing numerical parameters or modifying details of the
algorithm gives a variation in the value of acr at the transition that is at most of order 0.01.
for more details of the numerical aspect of this issue, see the appendix.

the resolution of this puzzle seems to lie beyond the precision of our numerical simula-
tions. several possibilities suggest themselves. first, there may be a sharp change in the
approach to criticality that is only seen when one reaches solutions for which (1/a)min is
less than the limits set by our spatial step size, in such a way that our extrapolation to the
critical limit is incorrect. it could be that the decrease in the minimum of 1/a suddenly
slows, and that it only reaches zero at acr > 3/2, or it could be that a new family of solutions
intervenes. alternatively, it may be that acr is correctly extrapolated, but that the critical
solution violates one or more of the assumptions that we enumerated at the beginning of
sec. iv. for example, the critical solution might have discontinuities in the matter elds at
the horizon; because this would occur at a zero in 1/a, it would not necessarily lead to a
divergent energy.

we turn now to the high-b regime, where the critical solution has an extremal horizon
in the core region, with u = u(r), h = h(r). the numerical solutions all have p = 0
for both the internal and external solutions, with the matter elds varying less rapidly than
|x|1/2 near the horizon. moreover, for the entire region where we observe this type of black
hole solution, the leading behavior of u  u and h  h at the horizon appears to be linear
in x, with the nonanalytic terms being subdominant. the relations between a, u, h and
r are all in agreement with our analytic results.

examining the solutions in more detail, we nd that in most of the interior portion of
the critical and near-critical solutions both u(r) and h(r) closely track u(r) and h(r). this is
easily understood by recalling the form of the matter action, eq. (2.5). once 1/a has become
small, the gradient terms in the action are much less important than the position-dependent
potential u. as a result, the elds that minimize the action should point-by-point be close
to the minimum of u, namely u(r) and h(r).

it may be at rst surprising that a second minimum in 1/a exists at r  r0 outside the
true horizon. to explain this, consider the behavior of the metric outside the monopole core.

27

if the matter elds u and h are negligibly small for r > rcore, then in this coulomb region
the mass function for a conguration with magnetic charge 4/e can be approximated by

this gives a local maximum of m(r)/r, corresponding to a local minimum of 1/a, at

with the value of 1/a at this minimum being 1  (m/m0)2. this minimum will occur,
regardless of whether or not there is a horizon at a smaller value of r, as long as rmin > rcore.
it is absent in our solutions for very large b because for those solutions a, and thus v, are
small enough that the core extends beyond r0.

vii. concluding remarks

we have used both analytic and numerical methods to study self-gravitating yang-mills-
higgs magnetic monopoles for a range of parameters, with an emphasis on their approach to
the black hole threshold as the higgs expectation value tends toward its critical value. we
nd two quite distinct behaviors. in the low-b regime, with weak higgs self-coupling, the
critical solution is identical to the extremal reissner-nordstrom solution outside the horizon.
inside the horizon, the matter elds are smooth and nonsingular, as is 1/a. however, because
of the step function behavior of ab at the horizon, b = gtt vanishes identically in the
interior. the associated singularity at the horizon means that an observer falling freely into
a critical or near-critical monopole will experience the strong tidal forces characteristic of a
horowitz-ross naked black hole.

one might speculate that these singularities were inextricably associated with the tran-
sition from a nonsingular monopole to a black hole spacetime and were independent of the
details of the higgs potential. however, our solutions in the large-b regime show that this is
not the case. for these, the critical solution has nontrivial matter elds outside the horizon,
and thus is an extremal black hole with hair. although the metric functions are still non-
analytic at the horizon, their singularities are much weaker and do not lead to large tidal
forces.

the transition between these two regimes is itself quite interesting, and is in many
ways reminiscent of a rst-order transition. for a range of values of b on both sides of
the transition point, 1/a for the critical solution has two distinct minima. for values of b
below the transition, 1/a is positive at the inner minimum and has a double zero at the
outer minimum at r = r0. the inner minimum moves downward with increasing b until, at
the transition point, there are two distinct but degenerate minima, with 1/a vanishing at
both. as b is increased further, the outer minimum moves upward while the inner minimum
remains a zero of 1/a. while this implies a discontinuity in the horizon area, the mass of
the black hole is continuous. in terms of black hole thermodynamics, this corresponds to

28

a discontinuity in the entropy but (because these are zero temperature black holes) a free
energy that is a continuous function of b.

our focus in this paper has been on the behavior of the monopole solutions as the higgs
expectation value is increased to its critical value. it seems natural to ask how these solu-
tions evolve if v is increased still further. actually, there is a bifurcation at this point. if one
requires that the solutions remain well-behaved at spatial innity, the solutions with v > vcr
are black hole solutions with singularities at r = 0. in the low-b regime, these are simply
nonextremal reissner-nordstrom black holes, of varying mass, with no dependence on either
a or b. (there are also magnetically-charged black holes with hair in this regime; however,
they are not continuously connected to our critical solutions.) in the high-b regime, the
counting of boundary conditions suggests that, for given values of a and b, the continuation
of the external solution is a one-parameter family of black holes with hair. alternatively,
one can require that the elds remain nonsingular at r = 0 and continue the interior solu-
tion. because there are three boundary conditions at the origin, compared to the two at
spatial innity, this gives solutions with nonsingular interiors bounded by horizons that are
uniquely determined by specifying a and b. the behavior of the metric near the horizon is
similar to that found when de sitter spacetime is written in static coordinates, suggesting
a cosmological interpretation for these solutions. we suspect that, possibly with a suitably
modied higgs potential, these may give rise to topological ination [13,14].

finally, having studied these self-gravitating monopoles and obtained an understanding
of their approach to criticality, we can use these solutions as tools for investigating the
transition from a nonsingular spacetime to one containing blackhole horizons. we will
describe this elsewhere.

appendix a: numerical discussion of transition regime

in section vi we noted that a discrepancy appears between the analytic argument that
low-b type critical solutions can only exist when acr > 1.5 and the numerical observation
that this type of critical solution persists when acr < 1.5. we discuss here the details of our
investigation that lead us to believe that this discrepancy is not a numerical artifact.

recall that the transition between the high and low-b type critical solutions is reminiscent
of a rst-order phase transition. the metric function 1/a(r) for a regular monopole solution
near criticality with b near the transition value possesses two minima, one near the extremal
reissner-nordstrom radius, r0, the other in the core of the monopole, r < r0. as a is
increased (for a xed b), one of these minima becomes a horizon, and a critical solution is
attained. if 1/a at the inner minimum becomes zero rst, then we have a high-b type critical
solution; when 1/a for the outer minimum touches down rst, we have low-b type solution.
let us examine each of these minima separately for regular solutions near criticality in this
transition region.

1. the core minimum

the inner minimum for the types of solutions under consideration varies rapidly with
both a and b, so one can identify very precisely when such a minimum becomes a horizon.
moreover, the eld variables and their derivatives are well-behaved near this radius, and the
numerical solutions here are robust and insensitive to variations in the numerical algorithm.
dierent numerical implementations of the eld equations leads to dierences in acr of a few
parts in 104 for a high-b type critical solution.

the numerical and analytic results could be reconciled if (1) the high-b type solutions
persisted down to lower b into a region where acr > 1.5 and (2) the identication of the
outer minimum as a zero of 1/a for the critical solutions in this region was a result of
numerical error. we can address the rst issue by using a trick.
in sec. iv we learned
that critical solutions solve separate interior and exterior boundary value problems. hence,
we can determine acr as a function of b for the high-b type solutions by just solving the
eld equations from the origin to the horizon, ignoring the exterior region from the horizon
out to spatial innity. by using an algorithm similar to that described in sec. iii, we nd
the family of critical solutions represented by the dashed line in the inset of figure 10.
these solutions have high-b type horizons but are not asymptotically at at spatial innity;
however, if there were an asymptotically at critical solution with the same value of b, it
would have the same acr as these solutions. this dashed line crosses acr = 1.5 when b = 25.6.
thus to be consistent with the analytic results, the transition value between low and high-b
critical solutions must occur for b < 25.6 (rather that at the value of b = 40 indicated by
our numerical results). again, this result appears to be numerically robust to a few parts in
104.

30

2. the coulomb minimum

according to the previous discussion, the ability to reconcile numerical and analytic
results now depends on the sensitivity of the outer minimum, the one near r0, to numerical
error. from the inset in figure 10, we see that in order for btr < 25.6, our values for acr for
the low-b type critical solutions must be in error (too low) by approximately 0.04. a priori,
such an error is certainly plausible. at this minimum, the solutions near criticality vary
sluggishly with a and b. the spatial derivatives of eld variables are large at this radius,
and indeed are expected to be singular if the outer minimum becomes a horizon. it is here
that we are most susceptible to numerical errors.

as we discussed in sec. iii, discretized versions of eqs. (2.8)(2.11) are implemented
in our numerical algorithm to identify static monopole solutions.
in order to probe the
robustness of the algorithm and the condence with which we can treat these solutions,
dierent implementations of the discretization were examined and compared. in particular,
we focus on eqs. (2.8) and (2.9). first, we used the straightforward expansion of these
equations.

though these two systems of equations are equivalent in the continuum limit, their dis-
cretized forms which appear in the numerical implementation suer a o[(r)2] dierence.
figure 11 shows the (1/a)min as a function of a for solutions near criticality using the
two dierent equation sets eq. (a1) and (a2) at b = 16 and b = 35. the curves in fig. 11
do not extend into the region where (1/a)min <
 1.0  106 since this is o[(r)2] and our
solutions break down. (for these calculations we used r = 5  104.) indeed we nd
no stable solutions at all in this regime; however, we expect this eect is an artifact of
the discretization. what happens for this very small (1/a)min is beyond the ability of our
resources to probe.

nevertheless, the extrapolated dierence in acr between the two numerical implemen-
tations were on the order 0.001. other similar variations in the numerical algorithm were
tried, and analogous results are found. moreover, varying the spatial discretization size also
yielded dierences in acr on the order 0.001. thus, numerical error does not seem to provide
the acr  0.04 needed to account for the discrepancy between the numerical observations
and the analytic results. to illustrate the scope of the discrepancy needed, the dierence be-
tween the two curves needs to be approximately eight times the total range of the horizontal
axis shown in fig. 11.

finally, there is no apparent qualitative change between solutions whose critical acr is
greater than or less than 1.5, as seen in fig. 11. the approach of (1/a)min to zero is a much
slower function of a as b increases, but there is no sharp change at acr = 1.5.
