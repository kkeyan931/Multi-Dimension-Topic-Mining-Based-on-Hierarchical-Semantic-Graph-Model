abstract

on manifolds with non-trivial killing tensors admitting a square root of the killing-
yano type one can construct non-standard dirac operators which dier from, but
commute with, the standard dirac operator. we relate the index problem for the non-
standard dirac operator to that of the standard dirac operator. this necessitates
a study of manifolds with torsion and boundary and we summarize recent results
obtained for such manifolds.

1

on manifolds like the four-dimensional kerr-newman and taub-nut manifolds, the geodesic
equations are integrable because of the existence of a symmetric second-rank killing tensor
k  [1], allowing the construction of a constant of motion

the killing tensor condition

k =

1
2

k pp .

k(;) = 0

(1)

(2)

is actually equivalent with the conservation of k, i.e. k commutes with the worldline hamilto-
nian

in the sense of poisson brackets:

h =

1
2

gpp

{k, h} = 0 .

related to this, the klein-gordon equation with minimal electromagnetic coupling on these
background spaces is soluble by separation of variables [2]. making use of the observation of
penrose and floyd that such killing tensors can have a square root of killing-yano-type [3, 4]:

with the properties

k = ff 

 ,

f = f ,

f; + f; = 0 ,

carter and mclenaghan showed the existence of a dirac-type linear dierential operator which
commutes with the standard dirac operator [5]. such non-standard dirac operators take the
form

df  5 (cid:18)f 

 d 

1
3!

h(cid:19) ,

where (in contrast to the more familiar dirac operators associated to covariantly constant com-
plex structures) the second term is nonzero,

h = f[;] = f; .

(8)

the square brackets in the middle expression denote complete anti-symmetrization with unit
weight; the last equality is obtained straightforwardly from the killing-yano conditions (6). in
this letter we discuss the zero mode spectrum of such dirac operators (see [6, 7] for a systematic
classication of manifolds admitting solutions to (6)).

the covariant derivative d includes the standard spin-connection term:

d =  

1
2

 ab

 ab ,

(9)

with the ab the usual dirac representation of the generators of the lorentz group on spinors.
in the following we frequently use the representation of vectors and tensors in local lorentz
components, obtained by contraction with a vielbein e a

 or the inverse vielbein e 

a , e.g.

f a
 = f 

 e a
 ,

cabc = e 

a e 

b e 

c h .

(10)

2

in this notation one can write the dirac operator (7) as

df = 5a (cid:18)f 

a d 

1
3!

bccabc(cid:19) .

the standard dirac operator (without torsion) is

then the killing-yano properties of f 

a guarantee the commutation relation

d = iae 

a d ;

[df , d] = 0 .

(11)

(12)

(13)

thus, the standard and non-standard dirac operators can be diagonalized simultaneously, which
is at the root of chandrasekhars observation that the dirac equation in the kerr-newman
solution is separable [8]. we stress that although one often formulates the commutation rela-
tion (13) in terms of poisson brackets (for example, in classical studies of spinning particles),
when examining index problems it is essential that one considers quantum commutators.

in even-dimensional spaces one can dene the index of a dirac operator as the dierence in the
number of linearly independent zero modes with eigenvalue +1 and 1 under 5:

index (d) = n0

+  n0
 .

(14)

the index is useful as a tool to investigate topological properties of the base-space, as well as in
computing anomalies in quantum eld theory; for a review see e.g. [9, 10]. eq.(13) now leads to
a simple but remarkable result for the index of the non-standard dirac operator df , to wit the
theorem:

index (df ) = index (d) .

(15)

below we sketch the proof of this theorem and discuss some of its possible implications.

let |, i denote an orthonormal basis of simultaneous eigenvectors of the standard and

non-standard dirac operators:

d |, i =  |, i ,

df |, i =  |, i .

(16)

now as 5 anti-commutes with each of the dirac operators, all non-zero eigenvalues occur in
pairs of opposite signs:

and similarly for df . projecting the states of xed eigenvalue onto the eigenstates of 5:

d5 |, i =  5d |, i =  5 |, i ,

one obtains the equivalent results

|, ;i 

1
2

(1  5) |, i ,

5 |, ;i =  |, ;i ,
d |, ;i =  |, ;i ,

df |, ;i =  |, ;i .

(17)

(18)

(19)

on the other hand, for the zero-modes a mismatch between positive and negative chirality states
may occur. note however, that even in the kernel of the dirac operator d the pairing of chirality
eigenstates holds for those vectors which are non-zero modes of df :

df |0, ;i =  |0, ;i .

(20)

therefore the only states in the kernel of d which can contribute to the index index(d) are the
simultaneous zero modes of d and df , i.e. the states |0, 0;i. denoting the number of positive,
resp. negative, chirality double-zero modes by n(0,0)
 , the index of the standard dirac operator is

index (d) = n(0,0)

+  n(0,0)



.

(21)

now the symmetry of the algebra of (anti-)commutation relations of d, df and 5 under inter-
change of d and df implies, that again only the simultaneous zero-modes of df and d contribute
to the index of the non-standard dirac operator df ; hence

index (df ) = n(0,0)

+  n(0,0)

 = index (d) .

(22)

this is the result we set out to prove.

we now comment on some interesting consequences of this theorem. it is well-known [9, 10] that
the index of a dirac operator can be computed using path-integral methods, being identical to
the witten index of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model for a spinning particle with
supercharge

q = e 

a a .

(23)

here a is the anti-commuting spin variable of the particle, forming a d = 1 supermultiplet with
the base-space co-ordinates x [11, 12], and  is the covariant momentum of the particle, which
is related to the canonical momentum p by

 = p +

i
2

abab .

(24)

the existence of a killing-yano tensor and a non-standard dirac operator on the base-manifold
now manifests itself as a new non-standard supersymmetry [13] with supercharge

qf = f 

a a +

i
3!

cabcabc .

the main algebraic properties of the supercharges under dirac-poisson brackets are

{q, q} = 2ih ,

{qf , q} = 0 ,

{qf , qf} = 2ik ,

(25)

(26)

where k now represents the supersymmetric extension of the killing constant (2); for example, in
the case of kerr-newman space-time it is the supersymmetric extension of carters constant [13].
let us again stress that for the study of the index, where one is interested in the spectrum of
states, one must consider the quantization of the spinning particle model. this problem is taken
up in detail in [14]

4

one may expect that the equality of the indices of the standard and non-standard dirac
operators now translates to the equality of the witten index for the standard and non-standard
supersymmetry. however, this translation involves some subtleties, which we briey discuss here.
first, let us recall that the witten index is dened as the dierence between the number of odd
and even fermion number zero modes of the hamiltonian of a supersymmetric theory, which may
be computed in regularized form as [9, 10]

indexw = lim
0

tr(cid:16)(1)f eh(cid:17) .

(27)

here h is the hamiltonian, obtained as the square of the standard supercharge. the formula
in (27) makes only denite sense once one understands what is meant by the symbol tr. of
course one should really view this as a sum over the spectrum of the regulator however, even
then three distinct cases can occur [15]. (i) the spectrum is discrete, in which case all states
save for the zero modes cancel pairwise and the index is some -independent integer counting
the disparity between positive and negative chirality zero modes. (ii) the spectrum includes a
continuum separated from the (discrete) zero mode sector by a gap. then, so long as one can
show that the densities of positive and negative non-zero modes are equal, the result is again an
integer independent of . (iii) the spectrum includes a continuum not separated from zero in
which case the index is no longer guaranteed to be integer nor -independent. for the case we
are interested in, namely the chiral gravitational anomaly on manifolds with boundary, atiyah,
patodi and singer [16] have shown how to impose boundary conditions for spinors which ensure
a well-posed index problem (case (i) in fact). essentially their non-local boundary conditions
stipulate the spectrum of the bulk modes in terms of the discrete spectrum of the compact
boundary manifold (see [14, 16, 17, 18, 19] for further details).

similarly, a quantity for the non-standard supersymmetry can be obtained by dening the

regularized expression

indexf = lim
0

tr(cid:16)(1)f ek(cid:17) .

(28)

the equality of the indices then is equivalent to the statement that taking the limit   0 these
two expressions are equal:
(29)

indexf = indexw .

comparison of the two expressions shows, that indexf actually is to be interpreted as the witten
index of a theory in which k is the hamiltonian. the relation between the theories of which h,
resp. k are the hamiltonians was investigated in detail in [20]. here we recall in particular two
results of that paper:

1. if k is a killing-carter constant of motion with respect to the hamiltonian h, then h is

a constant of motion in the theory with hamiltonian k.
corollary: if k is a symmetric killing tensor on a manifold with metric g, then g is a
symmetric killing tensor on a manifold with metric k. following [20] we call this recip-
rocal relation between manifolds with metrics and killing tensors interchanged a killing
duality.

2. the correspondence can be extended to supercharges in the following way: if qf is a non-
standard killing-yano supercharge in a theory with standard supercharge q and hamilto-
nian h, then q is a killing-yano supercharge in a dual theory with supercharge qf and

5

hamiltonian k; but if h and k are dierent then at least one of the manifolds is endowed
with torsion. this is because of the inclusion of the totally anti-symmetric tensor cabc in
the supercharge qf , as well as in the corresponding non-standard dirac operator df .

in order to implement the denition (28) and prove the equality (29) it is therefore necessary
to study index theorems on manifolds with torsion. furthermore, typically the manifolds in
question (e.g. taubnut and kerrnewman) have a boundary. index theorems on manifolds
with boundary are the subject of the atiyahpatodisinger (aps) index theorem. the extension
of their work to include torsion has recently been given in [14]. this is a rather intricate subject.
in particular, if one wishes to regard the dirac operators d and df as operators on independent
manifolds then one has to carefully study the hilbert spaces in which they act. these and other
detailed issues have been handled in depth in [14] so here we simply provide a summary of the
most important results.

on manifolds with boundary the index splits into three terms. the rst is the bulk contribution
which can be obtained by a heat kernel, paulivillars or supersymmetric path integral approach.
this term has been independently computed by several groups [21, 22, 14] and the result is

index(bulk) =

1

24.82 zm hr(e)mn  r(e)nm 

1
2

f (a)  f (a)  2 g dki .

(30)

here f (a) is the abelian eld strength of the one form obtained by dualising the totally anti-
symmetric part of the torsion (remember that the dirac operator couples only to the trace and
totally antisymmetric parts of the contortion tensor). the vector k is given by

k = (cid:16)dd +

1
4

aa +

1
2

r(cid:17) a

.

(31)

the second term required for the index is a boundary correction term given by the aps 
invariant. the idea is quite simple, when the manifold is of product form near the boundary
(i.e. a cylinder with the boundary manifold as cross section) the solutions of the dirac equation
can be derived directly from the solutions of the boundary dirac operator. therefore aps have
proven that the additional correction can be constructed directly from the eigenvalues of the
boundary dirac operator

index(boundary) = 

1
2(cid:16)(0) + h(cid:17) ,

(32)

where h denotes the number of zero modes of the boundary dirac operator and the  invariant
is given by

(s) = x{l6=0}

sign(l)
|l|s

(33)

with the sum running over the set of all non-vanishing eigenvalues {l 6= 0} of the boundary dirac
operator. observe that (0) essentially counts the disparity between the number of positive
and negative boundary eigenvalues. typically (0) must be computed on a case by case basis,
however for boundary manifolds given by a squashed s3 this computation has been performed
some time ago by hitchin [23]. the generalization of this computation to the torsion-full case
may again be found in [14].

6

of course, one is not always so lucky enough to have a manifold approaching a cylinder near the
boundary so that in the most general case a third correction is necessary. in the torsion-free case
this correction was found by gilkey [24] and amounts to the boundary integral over the dierence
between the chernsimons form of the product manifold obtained by extending the boundary
three-manifold to a cylinder and the chernsimons form of the actual four-manifold in question.
in the torsion-full case, in [14] it is shown how to extract a generalized chernsimons from the
integrand of (30). denoting quantities computed on the product manifold by the sharp symbol,
the generalized chernsimons correction to the index is given by

1

index(cs correction) =

24.82 zm hc (a)  2 k  c(a) + 2 ki .
note that k denotes the three form obtain by dualising the vector k in (31).
finally, it is enlightening to see all these corrections computed in an explicit example. the case
of taubnut and its torsion-full dual have been analysed in [14]. for the taubnut manifold
with metric

(34)

ds2 =

r + 2m

r

hdr2 + r2 d2 + r2 sin2  d2i +

4rm2

r + 2m hd + cos  di2

,

(35)

the bulk contribution was calculated to be 1/12 by hawking [25]. there is no clash with the
expectation of integer counting of zero modes by the index since the boundary corrections of aps
(as computed by hitchin) and gilkey were shown to exactly cancel the bulk term [18, 26, 27]
so that the nal result for the index of the taubnut manifold is exactly zero. therefore, we
would expect, from the considerations above, also a vanishing result for the index of the dual
manifold with metric given by

ds2

f =

r + 2m

r

hdr2 +

m2r2
(r + m)2 (cid:16)d2 + sin2  d2(cid:17)i +

4rm2

r + 2m(cid:16)d + cos  d(cid:17)2

(36)

the anticommutativity of the dirac operators d and df holds when the dual manifold has
antisymmetric torsion given by

t = 

4r2m2 sin 
(r + m)2 d  d  d .

(37)

in fact the results for the three contributions (30), (32) and (34) to the index of the dual dirac
operator df are given by each of the following three lines respectively [14]

indexdf =

r8
b + 12r7

b m + 86r6

b m2 + 340r5

b m3 + 753r4

note that the vanishing result holds for any positive radius to the boundary rb and this is a very
strong test of the formalism presented. let us conclude by remarking that in theories with local
supersymmetry, torsion is inevitably present. furthermore boundary physics in these theories
has become increasingly important [28], a fact which highlights the interest of our work.

acknowledgement for two of us (j.w.v.h. and a.w.) this work is part of the research pro-
gramme of the foundation for fundamental research of matter (fom).
