construction of a novel superstring in four dimensions

physics department, utkal university, bhubaneswar-751004, india.

b. b. deo

a string in four dimensions is constructed by supplementing it with forty four majorana fermions.
the central charge is 26. the fermions are grouped in such a way that the resulting action is
supersymmetric. the super-virasoro algebra is constructed and closed by the use of jacobi identity.
the tachyonic ground state decouples from the physical states. gso projections are necessary for
proving modular invariance and space-time supersymmetry is shown to exist for modes of zero mass.
the symmetry group of the model desends to the low energy group su (3)  su (2)  u (1)  u (1).

i. introduction

string theory was invented [1] as a sequel to dual resonance models [2] to explain the properties of strongly interacting
particles in four dimensions. assuming the string to live in a background gravitational eld and demanding weyl
invariance, the einstein equations of general relativity could be deduced. it was believed that about these classical
solutions one can expand and nd the quantum corrections. but diculties arose at the quantum level. eventhough
the strong interaction amplitude obeyed crossing, it was no longer unitary. there were anomalies and ghosts. due
to these compelling reasons it was necessary for the open string to live in 26 dimensions [3,16]. at present the most
successful theory is the ten dimensional superstring on a calabi-yau manifold or an orbifold. however, in order to
realise the programme of string unication of all the four particle interaction, one must eventually arrive at a theory
in four at space-time dimensions, with n=1 supersymmetry and chiral matter elds. this paper is an attempt in
that direction.

a lot of research has been done in the construction of four dimensional strings [4] specially in the latter half of the
eighties. antoniadis et al [5] have considered a four dimensional superstring supplemented by eighteen real fermions
in trilinear coupling. the central charge of the construction is 15. chang and kumar [6] have considered thirring
fermions, but again with the central charge at 15. kawai et al [7] have considered four dimensional model in a dierent
context than the model proposed here. none of these makes contact with a standard like model.

in section ii, we give the details of the supersymmetric model. section iii gives the usual quantization and super-
virasoro algebra is deduced in the section iv. bosonic states are constructed in section v. fadeev- popov ghosts are
introduced and the brst charge is explicitly constucted in section vi. ramond states are constructed in section vii.
in section viii the mass spectrum of the model and the necessary gso projections to eliminate the half integral spin
states are introduced. in section ix, we show that these projections are necessary to prove the modular invariance of
the model. space-time supersymmetry is shown to exist for the zero mass modes in sction x. in section xi we show
how the chain so(44)  so(11)  so(6)  so(5)  su (3)  su (2)  u (1)  u (1) is possible in this model.
as a guide to elucidate the model.

the literature on string theory is very vast and exist in most text books on the subject. the references serve only

ii. the model

the model essentially consists of 26 vector bosons of an open (closed) string in which there are the four bosonic
coordinates of four dimensions and there are fortyfour majorana fermions representing the remaining 22 bosonic
coordinates [8]. we divide them into four groups . they are labelled by  = 0, 1, 2, 3 and each group contains 11
fermions. these 11 fermions are again divided into two groups, one containing six and the other ve. for convenience,
in one group we have j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and in the other, k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

the string action is

s = 

 are the two dimensional dirac matrices

and obey

i 0 (cid:19) ,

1 =(cid:18) 0 i
i 0(cid:19)

{, } = 2 .

(2)

(3)

string co-ordinates x  are scalars in (,  ) space and vectors in target space. similarly ,j are spinors in (,  ) space
and vectors in target space.

in general we follow the notations and conventions of reference [9] whenever omitted by us. x (,  ) are the string

coordinates. the s are the odd indexed and s the even indexed majorana fermions decomposed in the basis

 =(cid:18) 

+ (cid:19) , and  =(cid:18) 

+ (cid:19) .

the nonvanishing commutation and anticommutations are

[ x (,  ), x  (,  )] = i (  )

{

a(,  ), 

b (,  )} =   ab (  )

{

a(,  ), 

b (,  )} =   ab (  )

the action is invariant under innitesimal transformations

to proceed further we note that in equation (8) and (14) we could have taken i instead of +i. we now introduce
a phase factor  to replace i in these equation.  depends on the number n of s (or its quantar), in a given
individual term. explicitly  = (1)1/4n(n1)+ 1
2 .  = i if n = 1 reproducing i in the above equations. but
2
 = 1 if n = 0 where two s have been contracted away and 2
one now readily calculates the algebra

 = 1 if n = 2.

{j+(), j+()}= (  )t++()
{j(), j()}= (  )t()
{j+(), j()}= 0

(20)

the time like components of x  are eliminated by the use of virasoro constraints t++ = t = 0. in view of

equation (20), we postuate that

0 = j+ = j = t++ = t

(21)

j+ is a sum of a real and imaginary term, the real term, is further, a sum of six mutually independent ,j s and
the imaginary term, the ve mutually independent ,k s. it will be shown in section v, that j+ = 0 constraint
excludes all the eleven time like components of s and s from the physical space.

as usual the theory is quantized (

o = p), with

a(m) and b(r) are normal ordering anomalies. taking the vacuum expectation value in the fock ground state |0, 0i
with four momentum p = 0 of the commutator [l1, l1] and [l2, l2], it is easily found that

the central charge c = 26. this is what is expected. each bosonic coordinate contribute 1 and each fermionic ones
contribute 1/2, so that the total central charge is +26.

for closed strings there will be another set of tilded generators satisfying the same algebra.

or b0,1

the resulting states in the second terms of equations (50), (51), (52) are dierent from the rst terms. so we
concentrate our attention for the vanishing of the rst term only. to satisfy equation (50), as usual the time like
component 0
m is excluded from . as a result the second terms of equation (51) and (52) contain only transverse
osillators. b0,1
are all independent anahilation operators for r > 0 and there is no relation
between them. therefore  should not contain any of the eleven time like components bj
r s, for, otherwise the
equality to zero in equations (51) and (52) cannot be achieved. thus the vanishing of the energy-momentym tensor
and the current excludes all the time like components from the physical space. no negative norm state will show up
in the physical spectrum and at the same time preserve so(6)  so(5) internal symmetry.
let us make a more detailed investigation to ensure that there are no negative norm physical states. we shall do
this by constructing the zero norm states or the null physical states. due to gso condition, which we shall study
later, the physical states will be obtained by operation of the product of even number of gs. so the lowest state
above the tachyonic state is

rs or bk

but g1/2g1/2 = 1

2{g1/2, g1/2} = l1. without loss of generality, the state is

| i = l1 | 1i + g1/2g1/2 | 2i

| i = l1 | i

(53)

this state to be physical, it must satisfy (l0  1) | i = 0 which is true if l0 | i = 0. the norm h | i = h  |
l1l1 | i = 2h  | l0 | i = 0. let us consider the next higher mass state

| i = l2 | 1i + l2

it can be shown that g3/2g1/2 | i = (1l2
evaluating (cid:2)l1, g3/2g1/2(cid:3) | i and (cid:2)l2, g3/2g1/2(cid:3) | i. g4
the next excited state as
| i =(cid:0)l2 + l2

1(cid:1) | i

(54)

the condition (l0  1) | i = 0 is satised if (l0 + 1) | i = 0. further the physical state condition l1 | i = 0 gives
the value of  = 3/2. the norm is easily obtained as

h | i =

1
2

(c  26)

(55)

this is negative for c < 26 and vanishes for c = 26. so the critical cenbtral charge is 26. it is easily checked that
l2 | i also vanishes for c = 26.

to nd the role of b and b modes, let us calculate the norm of the following state with p2 = 2

2{g3/2, g1/2} | i = 0 and so on satisng all the physical state conditions.

noting that l(b)

1 | 0, pi = l(b

4 (jj ) = 6 and 1

and third terms are 1
11 + 6 + 5 = 0
since l1 = g2
that g3/2 | i = 0. further l2 | i = 1

for obtaining a zero central charge so that the anomalies cancel out and natural ghosts are isolated, faddeev-popov

(fp) ghosts [12] are introduced. the fp ghost action is

where the ghost elds b and c satisfy the anticommutator relations

sf p =

the central charge is 26 and cancels the normal ordder a(m) and b(r) of the l and g generators. noting that

[lg

(68)

it is possible to construct an equation for the generator for the current of the ghost sector,

(71)

n takes only integral values whereas r is half integral. bn+r is therefore outside the ghost sector. it has a conformal
dimension of 5/2 so that ggh

r has the correct conformal dimension 3/2. the commutator

is easily evaluated demanding that equation (70) be satised. from jacobi identity (65)

thus from the usual conformal eld theory we have obtained the algebra of a superconformal eld theory. this is the

(84)

the ramond sector virasoro algebra is the same as the ns-sector with the replacement of gs by fs. it is necessary
to dene lo suitably to keep the anomaly equations the same [9].

in this ramond sector, a physical state | i should satisfy

fn | i = ln | i = 0 for n > 0

(85)

the normal order anomaly constant in the anticommutables of the ramond current generators has to be evaluated
0 = l0. using commutation

with care, beacuse the denation of f0 does not have a normal ordering ambiguity. so f 2
relation (43) with g replaced by f and the jacobi identity we get

(86)

(87)

(88)

the construction of null physical states becomes much simpler beacuse all fm terms can be assigned to lm
terms by the commution ration fm = 2[f0, lm]/m and f0 has eigen values which are roots of eigen values of l0
acting on the generic states or states constructed out of the quadratic states. thus the zero mass null physical state
with l0 | i = f 2

0 | i = 0 is simply

| i = l1 | i

(89)

with l1 | i = f1 | i = 0. the next excited state with (l0 + 1 i) becomes the same as in the bosonic sector.

it is easy to check that all physical state conditions

f2 | i = [l2, f0] | i = 0. for c = 26, there are no negative norm states in the ramond sector as well.

from equation (67) and (86), the ghost current anomaly constant is bg(r) =  26

of equation(87). the total current anomalies in both the sectors vanish.

viii. the mass spectrum

the ghosts are not coupled to the physical states. therefore the latter must be of the form (up to null state) [15].

|{n} pim denotes the occupation numbers and momentum of the physical matter states. the operator c1 lowers the
energy of the state by one unit and is necessary for brst invariance. the ghost excitation is responsible for lowering
the ground state energy which produces the tachyon.

|{n} pim  c1|0ig

(95)

therefore, the mass shell condition is

where

(96)

(97)

(98)

(99)

due to the presence of ramond and neveu-schwartz sectors with periodic and anti-periodic boundary conditions,
we can eect a gso projection [16] on the mass spectrum on the nsr model [17]. here the projection should refer
to the unprimed and primed quantas separately. the desired projection is

where f =p br  br; f  =p b

for closed strings we have a similar separation as in eq. (95), namely the left-handed states will be in the form

the mass spectrum can be written as

ix. modular invariance

(101)

(102)

the gso projection is necessary for the modular invariance of the theory. we follow the notation of seiberg and

witten [18]. following kaku [17], the spin structure (,  ) for a single fermion is given by
(1 + q2n1) =s 3( )

(,  ) = q1/24 t r q2pn

n nn = q1/24

( )

,



yn=1

(103)

where s will be the jacobi theta functions (,  ) [18], q = ei and ( )(2) = 1/3
functions of seiberg and witten for the twenty four unprimed oscillators are

( ). the path integral

this is normalised to one.

a((),  ) = (3( )/( ))12 ,

a((+),  ) = a((),



1 + 

) = (2( )/( ))12 ,

a((+),  ) = a(+,

1


) = (4( )/( ))12 ,

a((++). ) = 0 .

it is easily checked that the sum

a( ) = (3( )/( ))12  (2( )/( ))12  (4( )/( ))12

(104)

(105)

(106)

(107)

(108)

is modular invariant, using the properties of the theta functions given in [18].
if we prescribe a normalization 1 = 11/2 = e2i, then

for the twenty primed oscillators it is not so straightforward because of the ambiguity of fractional powers of unity.

a((),  ) = (( )/( ))10 ,
a((+),  ) = ei(2( )/( ))10 ,
a((+),  ) = ei(4( )/( ))10 ,

a((++),  ) = 0 .

4 ( ))/10( ) is also modular invariant upto the factor of cube root and
the sum (10
fractional roots of unity. the sum of the modulii is, of course, modular invariant. it is easy to construct the modular
invariant partition function for the two physical bosons, namely

(113)
in four dimensions [20]. for normal ordering constant is 1 in q2(l01) , 2/12 comes from the bosons and 44/24
comes from the fermions adding to 1 for both ns and r sectors.

x. space-time supersymmetry

let us construct the vector state of zero mass as


1|0ie(p) .

the condition p2 = 0 and l1|i = 0 gives the equation of motion and lorentz condition,

the ramond fermion give a state

p2e = 0

and pe = 0

d
1|0i(p) .

(114)

(115)

(116)

(p) is a dirac spinor of zero mass,  are the usual dirac gamma matrices. the condition f1|i = 0 gives the dirac
equation

  p (p) = 0 .

(117)

the bosonic degrees of freedom match the fermionic degrees of freedom.

for closed strings a similar analysis can be made with 

d
1|0i following the details
given by g.s.o., we get a massless antisymmetric tensor , massless scalar and a massless symmetric tensor (spin 2)
adding upto 4 degrees of freedom. the fermionic sector contains a massless spin 3/2 and a massless 1/2 adding upto
a total of four degrees of freedom as has been shown by g.s.o. for the four dimensional case.

xi. approach to standard model

the main motivation of constructing this theory is to see if the internal symmetry group makes contact with the
standard model which explains all experimental data upto date with a high degree of accuracy. the internal symmetry
of the group was so(44). we have divided them into four so(11)s and further subdivided to so(6) and so(5).
according to slansky [21] we can have the breaking

where

so(11)  so(6)  so(5)  gst

gst = suc(3)  sul(2)  uy (1)  u (1) .

(118)

(119)

this has the content of the standard model with an additional gauge boson. the 15 gauge elds of so(6) and 10
gauge elds of so(5) are contained in the states h 
 = 0) with the structure

kk (p) which are massless (p2

kk = 0, p a
there are also the massless ramond spinors d,j

from the condition f1|i = 0 we have ph  = ph  = ph  = ph  = 0. there are many vectors and scalars.
the vectors are like pa
jj = 0 and
a
kk = 0. the (i, j) and (k, k) antisymmetric parts are the 15 and 10 of so(6) and so(5) respectively.
k, ve in number. so in the
product space there are 30 chiral spinors which exactly correspond to the 15 chiral fermions and 15 chiral antifermions
in one generation of the standard model. the particles, er, ur, dr, (, e)l and (u, d)l and their antiparticles can be
assigned the usual quantum numbers under gst. the gst with fteen fermions is exactly space-time super-symmetric
has been proven in reference [22] recently.

with the help of the diagonal su (3) gallmann matrices 8 and 3 and isospin i3, one can construct a matrix

4 (38  3) which has three eigen values for the rst four sets and zero eigen values for the

operator qc = i3 + 1
courless leptons.

it is of interest to note that higgs boson is classically tachyonic. we cannot show that there are three generations
of fermions. perhaps it is related to the number of ways the 30 chiral fermions can be placed under gst. there are
many aspects which are not clear to us, but we have made out a case to study this model further to relate gravity
and standard model through string theory with a unique vacuum.

we have proted from discussions with dr. j. maharana and dr. s. mahapatra. the library, computer and other

facilities extended by institute of physics, bhubaneswar is thankfully acknowledged.
