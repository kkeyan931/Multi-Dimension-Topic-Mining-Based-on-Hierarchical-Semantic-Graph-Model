1 introduction:

gravity is the most time honored force.
it is an extremely beautiful and
successful theory. unfotunatly any try to quantize the gravitation theory of
einstein were unsuccessful. the reason is that the divergences encountered
are out of control in perturbation theory and non removable. conceptu-
ally,the appearance of such gravitational anomalies is quite drastic because
it signals the incompatibility of general relativity with the quantization pro-
cedure.

based on einsteins idea,moat built a new theory of gravity but with
the antisymmetric part of the metric taken as a part of the gravitation it-
self.this theory was called nonsymmetric gravitation theory (ngt) [1]-[8].
although the ngt classical tests are successful,one needs to quantize the the-
ory in order to have a consistent physical interpretation at the plank scale
and the unication program with the other fundamental interactions will be
successfully described. in fact,the quantum version (qngt)[9] of ngt was
purposed in the framework of the canonical operator formalism. it turn out
that the theory contains a larger symmetry [10]-[14] which let us hope to
the possibility solving the outstanding problem of the renormalizability of
quantum gravity.

on the other hand,the brst symmetry of yang mills has been gauged
[16] ,[17] via the introdctions of an external eld and a scalar ghost eld
invariant under the resulting local symmetry is associated with the gauge
parameter.

the isomorphism between the local and global algebras has been shown

and has permitted the anomaly [5],[17].

the purpose of this paper is to study the gauged qngt brst sym-
metry. in section 2,we construct the qngt local brst operator and the
corresponding invariant action. finally in section 3,we draw our conclusions.

2 gauged qngt brst symmetry:

the starting point of the construction of a local brst operator qloc corre-
sponding to gl (4, r)dieomorphism symmetry is the dilatation of ghosts
by a scale factor  (x) which depends upon the dieomorphism and plays
the role of a scalar ghost associated with the gauge parameter of the re-
sulting local symmetry . redenitions of elds in such a way as to render
their transformations under qloc linear in  (x) play a crucial role . in order
to perform this construction let ab = ab
dx be the spin
connection and vierbein respectively. we reminid the reader that the ngt
spinc onnection ab satises the relation [7]-[9]

 dx and ea = ea

where the notion  means hyperbolic complex conjugate

eab = ba

the corresponding eld strengths

and

rab = dab + accb

satisfy the bianchi identities:

dr = 0

respectively where d = d  + [,]is the covariant derivative and d =

dx.

subtraction of forms by and ab is the 0-form ghost eld corresponding to
the gl (4, r)symmetry verifying the property:

al these ghosts have the same ghost number +1.it is important to mention
that the property q2 = 0 guarantees the closure of the algebra. here

the brst operator q can be reviewed rst as dening a global symmetry.

dent parameter. because of the nilpotency of the q operator,  satises:

(2.9)

[1, 2] = 0

(2.10)

the transformation (2.9)can be made local by assuming that  is a function
of the coordinates x. then,the local transformation will take the form:

loc
(x) =  (x) q + 

(2.11)

where the local term  must be determined in such a way that the local
transformations (2.11) closure. to obtain the closure property,one turns
eq.(2.5) into a dierential algebra

loc
(x)  qloc
 (x)   (x)

where  (x) is a 0-form commuting scalar ghost associated with  (x),and
has a ghost number 0. to construct the local brst operator qloc,one dilates
the faddeev-popov ghosts    and ab  ab such that:

qloc () =   ()

qloc(cid:16)ab(cid:17) = l(cid:16)ab(cid:17)  2a

ccb

(2.13)

and then introduces an external gauge eld  = dx with a ghost number
-1. its corresponding eld strength  = d satises the identity:

one may set:

where

d = 0

e = ede

e =  +  + 

(2.12)

(2.14)

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

ed = d + qloc

e = exp () 

using the method of ref.[17],the horizontality condition can be written

as:

identication of the left-hand side (lhs)and right hand side (rhs)with re-
spect to the ghost number and the degree of forms leads to:

and

qloc = d + l

(2.19)

then by using (2.6),one nds:

qloc = l

(2.21)

(2.22)

where the new elds beaand babcorrespond to the local algebra. now,the

crucial step of this construction is the redenition of elds in such a way
as to make their transformations under qloc linear in . the convenient
redenitions are:

obtained from eqs.(2.22)have been used. the two sets of eqs.(2.21)and
(2.25)constitute the local brst algebra. notice that,by construction,this
algebra is isomorphic with that of the global algebra,thus the nilpotency is
automatically guaranteed:

q2

loc = 0

(2.28)

moreover ,if one sets  = 0 and  = 1,qloc reduces to q. the usefulness of
this construction consists of the derivation of the local action and current.
in fact,as it is shown in ref [9],the qngt action sqn gt =sqn gt (ea

notice that,being a total derivative,the last term has no eect on the
computation of the local (gauged) noether current . it comes from the 
derivative term in sgqn gt and it is conserved independently of the other
terms of j 

qn gt .

3 conclusions:

throughout this work,we have constructed a gauged brst current operator
and the corresponding invariant action. we have shown that this construc-
tion permits the computation of the noether current by a simple calcula-
tion of a derivative and that the local and global algebras are isomorphic.
thus,every thing is shown as anomalies can be used modulo the redenitions
of the elds.
