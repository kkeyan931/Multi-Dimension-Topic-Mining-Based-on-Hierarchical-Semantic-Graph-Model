abstract

if the fth dimension is one-dimensional connected manifold, up to dieo-
morphic, the only possible space-time will be m 4  r1, m 4  r1/z2, m 4  s1
and m 4  s1/z2. and there exist two possibilities on cosmology constant: the
cosmology constant is constant along the fth dimension, and the cosmology
constant is sectional constant along the fth dimension. we construct the gen-
eral models with parallel 3-branes on those kinds of the space-time and with
constant/sectional constant cosmology constant, and point out that for com-
pact fth dimension, the sum of the brane tensions is zero, for non-compact fth
dimension, the sum of the brane tensions is positive. we assume the observable
brane which includes our world should have positive tension, and obtain that
in those general scenarios, the 5-dimensional gut scale on each brane can be
indentied as the 5-dimensional planck scale, but, the 4-dimensional planck
scale is generated from the low 4-dimensional gut scale exponentially in our
world. we also give some simple models to show explicitly how to solve the
gauge hierarchy problem.

1 introduction

experiments at lep and tevatron have given the strong support to the standard
model su(3)c su(2)l u(1). however, the standard model has some unattractive
features which may imply the new physics. one of these problems is that the gauge
forces and the gravitational force are not unied. another is the gauge hierarchy
problem between the weak scale and the 4-dimensional planck scale. previously, two
solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem have been proposed: one is the idea of the
technicolor and compositeness which lacks calculability, and the other is the idea of
supersymmetry.

more than one year ago, it was suggested that the large compactied extra
dimensions may also be the solution to the gauge hierarchy problem [1]. furthermore,
about half year ago, randall and sundrum [2] proposed another scenario that the
extra dimension is an orbifold, and the size of the extra dimension is not large but the
4-dimensional mass scale in the standard model is suppressed by an exponential factor
from 5-dimensional mass scale. in addition, they suggested that the fth dimension
might be innity [3], and there may exist only one brane with positive tension at
the origin, but, there exists the gauge hierarchy problem. the remarkable aspect
of the second scenario is that it gives rise to a localized graviton eld. combining
those results, lykken and randall obtained the following physical picture [4]: the
graviton is localized on planck brane, we live on a brane separated from the planck
brane about 30 planck lengths along the fth dimension. on our brane, the mass
scale in the standard model is suppressed exponentially, which gives the low energy
scale. we generalized those scenarios and obtained the scenario with the following
property [18]: the 4-dimensional planck scale is generated from the low 5-dimensional
planck scale by an exponential hierarchy, and the mass scale in the standard model,
which is contained in the observable brane, is not rescaled. in short, recently, this
kind of compactication or similar idea has attracted a lot of attentions [5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31].
by the way, supergravity domain walls was discussed previously in the 4-dimensional
space-time [32].

in the later model building, there exist several approachs: (i) the 3-branes are
parallel along the fth dimension and the observable brane is one of those branes: oda
constructed the model with space-time m 4  s1 where m 4 is the four-dimensional
minkowski space, and cosmology constant is constant on s1 [12]. however, his solu-
tion is not general. h. hatanaka, m. sakamoto, m. tachibana, and k. takenaga con-
structed the model with space-time m 4 s1 and cosmology constant is sectional con-
stant [30]. and we constructed the model with only parallel positive tension 3-branes
on m 4  r1 and m 4  r1/z2 [19]. (ii) the observable sector or our world live in the
brane intersections/junctions
[6, 27, 28]. (iii) many brane intersections/junctions,
which might be thought to be the combination of the approach (i) and (ii) [20, 31]. in
this paper, we classify the models of the rst approach, or in other words, we classify
5-dimensional spce-time with parallel 3-branes. from dierential topology/manifold,
up to dieomorphic, there is only one connected non-compact one-dimensional man-

1

ifold: r1, there is only one connected non-compact one-dimensional manifold with
boundary: h1 or r1/z2 ( the equivalence class is y  y ), there is only one con-
nected compact one-dimensional manifold s1, and there is only one connected com-
pact one-dimensional manifold with boundary s1/z2 or i. therefore, the space-time
we consider are m 4  r1, m 4  r1/z2, m 4  s1, m 4  s1/z2. furthermore, there
are two possibilities for the cosmology constant: the cosmology constant is constant
along the fth dimension, and the cosmology constant is sectional constant along the
fth dimension.

before our discussion, we would like to explain our assumption and notation
which are similar to those in [18, 19]. we assume that all the gauge forces are unied
on each 3-brane if there exist gauge forces. the 5-dimensional gut scale on i-th
3-brane m5(i)
gu t and the 5-dimensional planck scale mx are dened as the gut
scale and planck scale in the 5-dimensional fundamental metric, respectively. the 4-
dimensional gut scale on i-th 3-brane m (i)
gu t and the 4-dimenisonal planck scale mpl
are dened as the gut scale and planck scale in the 4-dimensional minkowski metric
(). in order to avoid the gauge hierarchy problem between the weak scale and the
4-dimensional gut scale mgu t on the observable brane which includes our world,
we assume the low energy unication 2. the key ansatz is that the 5-dimensional
gut scale on each brane is equal to the 5-dimensional planck scale.
in addition,
as we know, an object with negative tension can not be stable, although we might
not need to worry about it if the anti-brane is orientable, so, we consider the model
with positive tension 3-branes and negative tension 3-branes. moreover, because the
brane with negative brane tension is an anti-gravity world [16], we assume that the
observable brane which includes our world has positive tension. by the way, there are
positive energy objects, namely d-branes and ns-branes, that are well understood
and on which gauge elds and matter elds can be localized so that the standard
model elds can be placed there.

in this paper, we construct the general models with parallel 3-branes on m 4 
r1, m 4  r1/z2, m 4  s1, and m 4  s1/z2. in general, if the space-time is compact,
the sum of the brane tensions is zero, if the space-time is non-compact, the sum of
the brane tensions is positive if one requires that the four-dimensional planck scale
is nite. in addition, if the cosmology constant is constant along the fth dimension,
we can dene the index of the model: the sum of the brane tensions divided by
6km 3
x where k is dened in the following section. if the space-time is m 4  r1, the
index is +1, if space-time is m 4  r1/z2, the index is + 1
2, and if the fth dimension
is compact, the index is 0. generally speaking, the cosmology constant might be
sectional constant along the fth dimension. moreover, for any point in m 4  r1,
m 4  r1/z2, m 4  s1 and m 4  s1/z2, which is not belong to any brane and
2we will not explain why mgu t can be at low energy scale here, but, it is possible if one
considers additional particles which change the rge running. of course, proton decay might be
the problem, but we do not disscuss this here. moreover, using extra dimensions, low-scale gauge
coupling unication can occur due to power-law running induced by the presence of kaluza-klein
states [21, 33], and proton-decay constraints might be satised in this framework.

the section where the cosmology constant is zero, there is a neighborhood which is
dieomorphic to ( or a slice of ) ads5 space.
it seems to us the gauge hierarchy
problem can be solved easily in these scenarios. assume we had l + m + 1 brane
with position yl < yl+1 < ... < ym1 < ym, (y), which is dened in the following
sections, will have minimal value at the brane with positive tension. without loss of
generality, we assume (yj) is minimal. if (yi)  (yj) is not small for all i 6= j,
then, m 2
x will be proportional to e2(yj ). and if the observable brane is at
y = yio, then the 4-dimensional gut scale in our world will be proportional to
mpl  e((yio )(yj )) under some conditions, if (yio)  (yj) = 34.5 and 30, we will
push the four-dimensional gut scale in our world to the tev and 105 gev range,
respectively. the 4-dimensional gut scale on j  th brane is the highest, but, it
does not mean the j  th brane has larger brane tension. furthermore, if (yj) > 0 3
and the j  th brane is the observable brane, we can also solve the gauge hierarchy
problem, but, the 5-dimensional planck scale will be very large.
in short, the 5-
dimensional gut scale on each brane can be indentied as the 5-dimensional planck
scale, but, the 4-dimensional planck scale is generated from the low 4-dimensional
gut scale exponentially in our world.

we also give some simple models to show how to solve the gauge hierarchy

problem.

this paper is organized as this way, in section 2, we discuss the general models
with constant cosmology constant for the space-time m 4  r1, m 4  r1/z2, m 4  s1
and m 4  s1/z2. in section 3, we discuss the general models with sectional constant
cosmology constant for the space-time m 4r1, m 4r1/z2, m 4s1 and m 4s1/z2.
the conclusion is given in section 4.

2 general model with constant cosmology con-

stant

first, we would like to consider the cosmology constant is constant along the fth
dimension, the space-time m 4  r1, m 4  r1/z2, m 4  s1 and m 4  s1/z2 will
be discussed in the subsection 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, respectively. by the way, generally
speaking, for any point in m 4  r1, m 4  r1/z2, m 4  s1 and m 4  s1/z2, which
is not belong to any brane, there is a neighborhood which is dieomorphic to ( or a
slice of ) ads5 space.

2.1 space-time m 4  r1
in this subsection, we would like to consider the fth dimension is r1. assume we
have m parallel 3-branes, and their fth coordinates are:  < y1 < ... < ym1 <

3 in this paper, we just consider (yj) > 0 with no consant term in (y), i. e. c = 0.

ym < +. the 5-dimensional metric in these branes are:

g(i)
(x)  g(x, y = yi) ,

where gab is the ve-dimensional metric, and a, b = , y 4.

the classical lagrangian is given by:

s = sgravity + sb ,

sgravity = z d4x dy g{ +

sb =

xi=1z d4xqg(i){li  vi} ,

(1)

(3)

(4)

where mx is the 5-dimensional planck scale,  is the cosmology constant, and vi
where i = 1, ..., m is the brane tension.

the 5-dimensional einstein equation for the above action is:

gabr(cid:19) =

(5)

assuming that there exists a solution that respects 4-dimensional poincare invariance
in the x-directions, one obtains the 5-dimensional metric:

ds2 = e2(y)dxdx + dy2 .

with this metric, the einstein equation reduces to:

now, we consider the general solutions. for m is odd, assuming that m = 2n+1

where n  0, we obtain:

(y)a =

2n+1

xi=1

(1)i+1k|y  yi| + c ,

(9)

4 we assume that g5 = 0 here. in addition, if the fth dimesnion has z2 symmetry, i. e., the

lagrangian is invariant under the transformation y  y, then, g5 = 0.

(y)b =

2n+1

(1)ik|y  yi| + c .

xi=1

for m is even, assuming that m = 2n where n  1, we obtain:

(y)c =

(1)i+1k|y  yi|  ky + c ,

(y)d =

(1)ik|y  yi| + ky + c .

2n

and one can easily obtain the cosmology constant:

i = 6km 3
x .

for solution a and c, the bane tensions are:

vi = (1)i+16km 3
x ,
and for solution b and d, the brane tensions are:

vi = (1)i6km 3
x .

for the cosmology constant is constant along the fth dimension, we can dene
the index of these kinds of models: the sum of brane tensions divided by 6km 3
x.
therefore, solution a has index +1, solution b has index 1, the solution c and
d have index 0. if one required that the 4-dimensional planck scale is nite, only
solution a is reasonable. therefore, we obtain the ve-dimensional metric:

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16)

(17)

ds2 = e2p2n+1

i=1 (1)i+1k|yyi|2cdxdx + dy2 .

and the corresponding four-dimensional planck scale is:

m 2

pl =

m 3

x  2n+1
xi=1

(1)i+1e2(yi)! .

in addition, the four-dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m (i)

gu t is related to

the ve-dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m5(i)

gu t :

m (i)

gu t = m5(i)

gu t e(yi) .

(18)

our general assumption is that m5(i)

gu t  mx, for i = 1, ..., 2n + 1.

this solution can be generalized to the solution with z2 symmetry: one just

requires that, yn+1 = 0, yi = y2n+2i for 1  i  n.

now, we would like to give two simple examples.

(20)

(22)

of the brane tension divided by 6m 3

(i) three brane case: their positions are y1, y2, y3, respectively, and the values
x are: k, k, k, respectively. therefore, we obtain:
(1)i+1k|y  yi| + c ,
xi=1

(y) =

(19)

3

(y1) = k(y3  y2) + c , (y2) = k(y3  y1) + c ,

(21)
without loss of generality, we assume y2  y1 < y3  y2. the four-dimensional

(y3) = k(y2  y1) + c .

planck scale are

m 2

pl =

m 3
x
k

e2(y3)(cid:16)e2((y1)(y3))  e2((y2)(y3)) + 1(cid:17) .

if the brane with position y1 is the observable brane which includes our world,
we can solve the gauge hierarchy problem. assuming that e2((y1)(y3)) << 1, and
mx = k, we obtain:

m (1)

gu t = mplek(y3+y12y2) .

(23)
so, we can push the gut scale in our world to tev scale and 105 gev scale range if
k(y3 + y1  2y2) = 34.5 and 30, respectively. and the value of (y3) = k(y2  y1) + c
determines the relation between mpl and mx.
if the brane with position y3 is the observable brane which includes our
world, we can solve the gauge hierarchy problem, too. assuming that mpl = k
and e2((y1)(y3)) << 1, we obtain:

m (3)

gu t = mple 1

3 k(y2y1) 1

3 c ,

(24)

with k(y2y1)+c = 103.5 and 90, we can have gut scale in our world at tev scale and
105 gev scale, respectively. obviously, in this case, because of the exponential factor,
the ve dimensional planck scale is very high, 1048 gev and 1044 gev, respectively.
(ii) five brane case with z2 symmetry: their positions are: y1 = y5, y2 =
y4, y3 = 0, y4, y5, respectively, and the values of the brane tensions divided by 6m 3
are: k, k, k, k, k, respectively. therefore, we obtain:

(y) = k|y| +

xi=4

(1)i+1k(|y  yi| + |y + yi|) + c ,

(y1) = (y5) = ky5 + c ,

(y2) = (y4) = 2ky5  ky4 + c ,

(y3) = 2k(y5  y4) + c .

(25)

(26)

(27)

(28)

without loss of generality, we assume that, y5 > 2y4. the four-dimensional

planck scale are:

m 2

pl =

x
k

e2ky52c(cid:16)2  2e2k(y5y4) + e2k(y52y4)(cid:17) .

(29)

6

if the brane with position y3 is the observable brane, the gauge hierarchy
problem can also be solved. assuming that e2k(y52y4) << 1, and mx = k, we
obtain:

gu t = mplek(y52y4) .

(30)
so, the gut scale in our world will be pushed to tev scale and 105 gev scale range
if k(y5  2y4) = 34.5 and 30, respectively. and the value of ky5 + c determines the
relation between mpl and mx.
if the brane with position y1 is the observable brane, one can also solve the
gauge hierarchy problem. assuming that mpl = k and e2k(y52y4) << 1, one obtains:

m (3)

m (1)

gu t = mple 1

3 ky5 1

3 c ,

(31)

with ky5 + c = 103.5 and 90, one obtains that the gut scale in our world is at tev
scale and 105 gev scale, respectively. the ve-dimensional planck scale is 1048 gev
and 1044 gev, respectively.

2.2 space-time m 4  r1/z2
now, we consider the space-time is m 4  r1/z2. the solution in subsection 2.1 can
also be generalized to this case in which the fth dimension is r1/z2. if the solution
in last subsection has z2 symmetry, we just introduce equivalence classes: y  y and
i th brane  (2n + 2 i) th brane. in fact, the only dierence from above r1 case
is that the fth dimension is h1 or r1/z2, i.e., 0  y < +, so, the integration of
dy is from 0 to . the trick point is the tension of brane at origin. we would like to
explain the technical detail as this way: the brane at origin which is (n + 1)-th brane
x, we split it into two branes with equal tension (1)n3km 3
with tension (1)n6km 3
x,
and the positions y =  and y = +, respectively. in the limit,   0, we obtain the
original case. therefore, d(y)
dy is zero at y = 0. and the brane tension vn+1 is half
of the original value, i. e., vn+1 = (1)n3km 3
x after module equivalence classes. in
general, using this method, we obtain d(y)
is zero at boundary. and in this case, the
dy
index is 1
2. in short, the result is similar to that in last subsection with z2 symmetry.

for n is odd, we obtain:

(y) =

2n+1

xi=n+2

(1)i+1k|y  yi| + c ,

and for n is even, we obtain:

2n+1

(1)i+1k|y  yi| + c ,

(y) = k|y| +

xi=n+2

where

c = c +

n

xi=1

(1)i+1ky2n+2i .

7

(32)

(33)

(34)

because c is just a constant, we will write it as c in the following part. similar
convention will be used in the following subsections.

for the simplicity, we just renumber above subscript i where i = n+1, ..., 2n+1
as i  (n + 1). so, we have n + 1 parallel 3-branes, with position y0 = 0 < y1 < ... <
yn1 < yn < +. the (y) can be written as:
xi=1

(1)i+nk|y  yi| + c .

(1 + (1)n)k|y| +

(y) =

one can easily obtain the cosmology constant

 = 6km 3
x ,

and the bane tensions are:

x , vi = (1)i+n6km 3
x .
and the corresponding 4-dimensional planck scale is:

v0 = (1)n3km 3

m 2

pl =

(1)i+ne2(yi)! .

(41)

m (i)

gu t = m5(i)

gu t e(yi) .

(39)

now, we discuss the example, for three brane case, it is equivalent to above
5-brane case, so, we donot rediscuss it here. we discuss four 3-brane case: their
positions are y0, y1, y2, y3, respectively, and the values of the brane tensions divided
by 6m 3

2 k, k, k, k, respectively. therefore, we obtain:

x are:  1

(y) =

3

xi=1

(1)i+1k|y  yi| + c ,

(y0) = k(y3 + y1  y2) + c , (y1) = k(y3  y2) + c ,

(y2) = k(y3  y1) + c , (y3) = k(y2  y1) + c .

(42)
without loss of generality, we assume y2  y1 > y3  y2. the four-dimensional

planck scale are

pl =

e2k(y3y2)2c(cid:18)

2

e2ky1 + 1  e2k(y2y1) + e2k(2y2y1y3)(cid:19) .

(43)

if the brane with position y3 is the observable brane, we can solve the gauge

hierarchy problem. assuming that e2k(2y2y1y3) << 1, and mx = k, we obtain:

m (3)

gu t = mplek(2y2y1y3) .

(44)

8

so, we can push the gut scale in our world to tev scale and 105 gev scale range if
k(2y2  y1  y3) = 34.5 and 30, respectively. and the value of (y1) = k(y3  y2) + c
determines the relation between mpl and mx.
if the brane with position y1 is the observable brane, we can solve the gauge
hierarchy problem, too. assuming that mpl = k and e2k(2y2y1y3) << 1, we obtain:

m (1)

gu t = mple 1

3 k(y3y2) 1

3 c ,

(45)

with k(y3  y2) + c = 103.5 and 90, we can have gut scale in our world at tev scale
and 105 gev scale, respectively. the ve dimensional planck scale is 1048 gev and
1044 gev, respectively.

2.3 space-time m 4  s1
now, we consider the fth dimension is s1. because the adjacent two branes will have
opposite brane tensions, i. e., one has positive tension, and the other one has negative
tension, we will have even number of branes and the index is 0. let us assume that
we have 2n brane, and their position are 0  y1 < y2 < ... < y2n1 < y2n < 2,
where  is the radius of the fth dimension. the lagrangian, einstein equation, and
the dierential equations of (y) are similar to those in subsection 2.1 except we must
have even number of branes, and 0  y  2, and (0) = (2).

if y1 = 0, then, the solutions of (y) are

(y)a =

2n

xi=2

(1)i+1k|y  yi| + c ,

(y)b =

2n

xi=2

(1)ik|y  yi| + c .

if y1 6= 0, then, the solutions are:
xi=1

(y)c =

2n

(1)i+1k|y  yi|  ky + c ,

(y)d =

2n

xi=1

(1)ik|y  yi| + ky + c .

and one can easily obtain the cosmology constant

for solution a and c, the bane tensions are:

i = 6km 3
x .

vi = (1)i+16km 3
x ,

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

(51)

and for solution b and d, the brane tensions are:
vi = (1)i6km 3
x .

(52)

the constraint is (0) = (2r). so, we obtain the constraint equations on

solutions a, b, c, d, respectively:

in addition, the four-dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m (i)

gu t is related to

the ve-dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m5(i)

gu t :

where f = a, b, c, d.

m (i)

gu t = m5(i)

gu t e(yi)f ,

(59)

in addition, we can consider the fth dimension with z2 symmetry. the z2
symmetry is dened by the transformation of y  2  y, and the metric and
lagrangian is invariant under this transformation. with z2 symmetry, we must have
a brane at position 0, and a brane at position . therefore, only solution (a) and
(b) are possible. so, y1 = 0, yn+1 = , yi = 2  y2n+2i for i = 2, ..., n.
let us give an explicit model. we discuss four 3-brane case: their positions
are: y1 = 0, y2, y3, y4, respectively, and the values of the brane tensions divided by
6m 3

x are: k, k, k, k, respectively. therefore, we obtain:
(1)i+1k|y  yi| + c ,

(y) =

xi=2

(60)

so, the constraint equation is:

and one can easily obtain:

y3 = y2 + y4   .

(y1) = k + c , (y2) = k(  y2) + c ,

(61)

(62)

(y3) = k(y4  y2) + c , (y4) = k(y4  ) + c .

(63)
without loss of generality, we assume y4  y2 < . the four-dimensional

planck scale are

m 2

pl =

m 3
x
k

e2k2c(cid:16)1  e2ky2 + e2k(y4+y2)  e2k(2y4)(cid:17) .

(64)

if the brane with position y3 is the observable brane, we can solve the gauge
hierarchy problem. assuming that e2k(y4+y2) << 1 and e2ky2 << 1, and mx = k,
we obtain:

m (3)

gu t = mplek(y4+y2) .

(65)

so, we can push the gut scale in our world to tev scale and 105 gev scale range
if k(  y4 + y2) = 34.5 and 30, respectively. and the value of k  c determines
the relation between mpl and mx.

2.4 space-time m 4  s1/z2
now, we would like to consider the space-time is m 4  s1/z2. the solution with
z2 symmetry in subsection 2.3 can be generalized to this case. for the solution
with z2 symmetry in 2.3, we introduce the equivalence classes: y  2  y, and
i  th brane  (2n + 2  i)  th brane. moduling the equivalence classes, we obtain
the model on m 4  s1/z2 with n + 1 brane. using our splitting boundary branes
method as before, we obtain the tensions of the boundary branes will be half of the
original values. so, the index in this case is zero, too, which is the only constraints
in this kind of model. in short, after module equivalence classes, we will have n + 1
brane with position y0 = 0 < y1 < ... < yn1 < yn = .

the general solutions of (y) are

(y) = sign(v0) n1
xi=1

(1)ik|y  yi| +

(1 + (1)n+1)ky! + c ,

where sign(vi) = |vi|/vi, for i = 1, ..., n.

gu t is related to the

gu t = m5(i)

gu t e(yi) .

(68)

here, we will give two simple examples.
(i) although the three brane case is equivalent to above four 3-brane case with
z2 symmetry module the equivalence classes. here, we also discuss three 3-brane case,
for its simplicity and phenomenology interesting. assuming we have three brane with
positions: y0 = 0, y1, y2 = , respectively, and the values of the brane tension
divided by 6m 3

2k, respectively, we obtain:

x: 1

2k, k, 1

(y) = k|y  y1| + c ,

(y0) = ky1 + c , (y1) = c ,

(y2) = k(  y1) + c .

without loss of generality, we assume  < 2y1. the four-dimensional planck

scale are

pl =

2k

e2ky12c(cid:16)1  2e2ky1 + e2k(2y1)(cid:17) .

if the brane with position y2 is the observable brane, we can solve the gauge

hierarchy problem. assuming that e2k(2y1) << 1, and mx = 2k, we obtain:

m (2)

gu t = mplek(2y1) .

(73)

so, we can push the gut scale in our world to tev scale and 105 gev scale range
if k(2y1  ) = 34.5 and 30, respectively. and the value of ky1  c determines the
relation between mpl and mx.
(ii) we discuss four 3-brane case: their positions are: y0 = 0, y1, y2, y3 = ,
2k, k, k,

respectively, and the values of the brane tension divided by 6m 3
 1
2 k, respectively. therefore, we obtain:

(y0) = k(y2  y1) + c , (y1) = ky2 + c ,

without loss of generality, we assume 2y1 < y2. the four-dimensional planck

if the brane with position y0 is the observable brane, we can solve the gauge
hierarchy problem. assuming that e2k(y22y1) << 1, e2k(y2) << 1, and mx = k,
we obtain:

m (0)

gu t = mplek(y22y1) .

(78)

so, the gut scale in our world will be pushed to tev scale and 105 gev scale range
if k(y22y1) = 34.5 and 30, respectively. and the value of (y2) = ky1 + c determines
the relation between mpl and mx.
if the brane with position y2 is the observable brane, one can also solve the
gauge hierarchy problem. assuming that mpl = k and e2k(y22y1) << 1, e2k(y2) <<
1 , one obtains:

m (2)

gu t = mple 1

3 ky1 1

(79)

with ky1 + c = 103.5 and 90, one will have the gut scale in our world at tev scale
and 105 gev scale range, respectively. the ve-dimensional planck scale is 1048 gev
and 1044 gev, respectively.

3 general model with sectional constant cosmol-

ogy constant

now, we consider the cosmology constant is not constant along the fth dimesnion,
although it is constant between any two adjacent branes, and between +/  
and the brane with maximum/minimum fth dimension coordinate. the space-time
m 4  r1, m 4  r1/z2, m 4  s1 and m 4  s1/z2 will be discussed in the subsection
3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, respectively. in addition, we assume that i,i+1 6= 0 in the discussion
of the explicit models, where i,i+1 is dened in the following subsections.

3.1 space-time m 4  r1
first, we consider the fth dimension is r1. assuming we have l + m + 1 parallel
3-branes, and their fth coordinastes are:  < yl < yl+1 < ... < y1 < y0 < y1 <
... < ym1 < ym < +. the 5-dimensional metric in these branes are:

g(i)
(x)  g(x, y = yi) ,

where gab is the ve-dimensional metric, and a, b = , y.

the classical lagrangian is given by:

s = sgravity + sb ,

sgravity = z d4x dy g{(y) +

(80)

(81)

(82)

sb =

m

xi=lz d4xqg(i){li  vi} ,

(83)

where mx is the 5-dimensional planck scale, (y) is the cosmology constant, and vi
where i = l, ..., m is the brane tension. the (y) is dened as the following:

m

(y) =

xi=1
i ((y  yi1)  (y  yi)) + +(y  ym)
xi=l+1

i ((y + yi)  (y + yi1)) + (y + yl) ,

+

0

(84)

where (x) = 1 for x  0 and (x) = 0 for x < 0. from advanced calculus, we know
that (y) is piece-wise continuous or sectionally continuous, exactly speaking, (y)
is sectional constant.

the 5-dimensional einstein equation for the above action is:

g(cid:18)rab

m 3
x
m

gabr(cid:19) = 
xi=l

[(y)g gab +
viqg(i) g(i)
m 

 

n (y  yi)] .

(85)

assuming that there exists a solution that respects 4-dimensional poincare invariance
in the x-directions, one obtains the 5-dimensional metric:

ds2 = e2(y)dxdx + dy2 .

with this metric, the einstein equation reduces to:

2 = (y)
6m 3
x

,  =

m

xi=l

vi
3m 3
x

(y  yi) .

so,  is also sectionally continuous or sectional constant.

the general solution to above dierential equations is:

(y) =

m

xi=l

ki|y  yi| + kcy + c ,

(86)

(87)

(88)

where kc and c are constants, and ki 6= 0 for i = l, ..., m. the relations between the
ki and vi, and the relations between the ki and i are:

vi = 6kim 3

i = 6m 3

x(

xj=l

kj + kc)2 .

(91)

therefore, the cosmology constant is negative except the section between the two
branes where the cosmology constant is zero, then, for any point in m 4  r1, which
is not belong to any brane and that kinds of sections, there is a neighborhood which
is dieomorphic to ( or a slice of ) ads5 space, similarly, this statement is correct
for the space-time m 4  r1/z2, m 4  s1 and m 4  s1/z2. moreover, the cosmology
constant and brane tensions should satisfy above equations. in order to obtain nite
4-dimensional planck scale, we obtain the constraints: pm
j=l kj > |kc|. so, the sum

of brane tension is positive.

the general bulk metric is:

ds2 = e2pm

i=l

ki|yyi|2kcy2cdxdx + dy2 .

and the corresponding 4-dimensional planck scale is:

where

t,l =

if i,i+1 6= 0, then

and if i,i+1 = 0, then

where

ti,i+1 =

2i,i+1 (cid:16)e2(yi+1)  e2(yi)(cid:17) ,
ti,i+1 = (yi+1  yi)e2(yi) ,

(92)

(93)

(94)

(95)

(96)

(97)

(98)

by the way, one can easily prove that ti,i+1 is positive, which makes sure that the
4-dimensional planck scale is positive.

in addition, the four-dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m (i)

gu t is related to

the ve-dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m5(i)

gu t :

m (i)

gu t = m5(i)

gu t e(yi) .

(99)

in this paper, we assume that m5(i)

gu t  mx, for i = l, ..., m.

15

now, in general, we would like to explain how to solve the gauge hierarchy
problem. using fact that t,l > 0, tm,+ > 0, ti,i+1 > 0 where i = l, ..., m  1,
and noticing that pm
j=l kj > |kc|, we can prove that if (yj) is the minimal value of
(yi) for all i, then the j  th brane will have positive tension. if e2((yi)(yj )) << 1
for all i 6= j, then, one obtain:

m 2

pl =

m 3
x
mc

e2(yj ) ,

(100)

where mc is a function of kc and ki for all i. and assume the observable brane is at
y = yio and mx = mc, we obtain:

m (io)

gu t = mple((yio )(yj )) .

(101)

so, if (yio)(yj) = 34.5 and 30, we will push the four-dimensional gut scale in our
world to the tev and 105 gev range, respectively. of course, the 4-dimensional gut
scale on j  th brane is the highest, but, the j  th brane does not need to have larger
brane tension. furthermore, if (yj) > 0, and if the j  th brane is the observable
brane, we can also solve the gauge hierarchy problem. assume that mpl = mc, we
obtain:

m (j)

gu t = mple 1

(102)
with (yj) = 103.5 and 90, we can have gut scale in our world at tev scale and 105
gev scale, respectively. obviously, in this case, because of the exponential factor,
the ve-dimensional planck scale is very high, 1048 gev and 1044 gev, respectively.
these solutions can be generalized to the solution with z2 symmetry. because
of z2 symmetry, kc = 0. there are two kinds of such models, one is the odd number
of the branes, the other is the even number of the branes. for the rst one, one just
requires that ki = ki, yi = yi, and m = l. for the second case, one just requires
that ki = ki, yi = yi, m = l, and k0 = 0 (no number 0 brane).

now, we discuss three examples:
(i) first, we consider one brane with position y0 and the value of the brane

3 (yj ) ,

tension divided by 6m 3

x is k0. therefore, we obtain:

obviously, we need to require that k0 > |kc|. one can easily obtain that:

(y) = k0|y  y0| + kcy + c .

(y0) = kcy0 + c .

the four-dimensional planck scale are

3 c ,

16

with kcy0 + c = 103.5 and 90, the gut scale in our world will be pushed to tev scale
and 105 gev scale range, respectively. the ve-dimensional planck scale is 1048 gev
and 1044 gev, respectively. by the way, if kc = 0, the constant c is the key factor,
which is often thought physical irrelevant. the model with kc = c = 0 was discussed
in [3] .

in addition, we can obtain the exact relation between mpl and m (0)

gu t :

mpl = m (0)

mxk0
k2
0  k2

c

.

(107)

gu tvuut

0  k2

in order to solve the gauge hierarchy problem, in general, we might require that mx
is very large compare to k0 and kc, or k2

c is very smalll.

(ii) two brane cases: their positions are y0, y1, respectively, and the values of

the brane tension divided by 6m 3

x are: k0, k1, respectively. therefore, we obtain:

(y) = k0|y  y0| + k1|y  y1| + kcy + c ,

the constrint is k0 + k1 > |kc|. one can easily obtain:

(y0) = k1(y1  y0) + kcy0 + c ,
(y1) = k0(y1  y0) + kcy1 + c .

the four-dimensional planck scale are

(110)

(111)

if k0 > 0, k1 > 0, without loss of generality,assuming that (y0) < (y1) and

e2((y1)(y0)) << 1, we obtain

m 2

pl = m 3

k0

k2

0  (k1  kc)2 e2(y0) .

(112)

if the brane with position y1 is the observable brane, assuming mx = k2
obtain:

0(k1kc)2

, we

k0

m (1)

gu t = mple((y1)(y0)) .

(113)
so, we can push the gut scale in our world to tev scale and 105 gev scale range if
(k0  k1 + kc)(y1  y0) = 34.5 and 30, respectively. and the value of (y0) determines
the relation between mpl and mx. explicit example: k0 = k1 = kc > 0, kc(y1  y0) =
34.5 and 30, which is not discussed in [19]. from this explicit example, we conclude
that kc is also an important factor to solve the gauge hierarchy problem.

if the brane with position y0 is the observable brane, we can solve the gauge
and

hierarchy problem only when (y0) > 0. assuming that mpl = k2
e2((y1)(y0)) << 1, we obtain:

0(k1kc)2

k0

m (0)

gu t = mple 1

3 (y0) ,

(114)

17

with (y0) = 103.5 and 90, we can have gut scale in our world at tev scale and
105 gev scale, respectively. the ve-dimensional planck scale is 1048 gev and 1044
gev, respectively.

if k0 > 0, k1 < 0, the solution to the gauge hierarchy problem is similar to that

in just above paragraph.

(iii) three brane case: their positions are y1, y2, y3, respectively, and the
x are: k1, k2, k3, respectively. and the

values of the brane tension divided by 6m 3
constraint is k1 + k2 + k3 > |kc|. therefore, we obtain:

(y) =

3

xi=1

ki|y  yi| + kcy + c ,

(y1) = k2(y2  y1) + k3(y3  y1) + kcy1 + c ,
(y2) = k1(y2  y1) + k3(y3  y2) + kcy2 + c ,
(y3) = k1(y3  y1) + k2(y3  y2) + kcy3 + c .

the four-dimensional planck scale are

(119)

if there exist at least two brane which have positive tensions. without loss of
generality, assuming the brane with position y1 has positive tension, (y1) < (y2),
and (y1) < (y3). if e2((y2)(y1)) << 1 and e2((y3)(y1)) << 1, we obtain

m 2

pl = m 3

x

k2

1  (k2 + k3  kc)2 e2(y1) .

(120)

if the brane with position yj where j = 2, 3 is the observable brane, and assuming
mx = k2

, we obtain:

1(k2+k3kc)2

k1

m (j)

gu t = mple((yj )(y1)) .

(121)

so, the gut scale in our world will be at tev scale and 105 gev scale range if
(yj)  (y1) = 34.5 and 30, respectively. and the value of (y1) determines the
relation between mpl and mx. for an explicit example, y1 = y3, y2 = 0, and
k1 = k3 = kc, k2 =  1

2 kc.

(y1) =

2

kcy3 + c , (y2) = 2kcy3 + c ,

(122)

(y3) =

kcy3 + c .

if mx = 3

4 kc and the brane with position y3 is the observable brane, we obtain

so, one can easily solve the gauge hierarchy problem.

m (3)

gu t = mple3kcy3 .

(123)

(124)

if the brane with position y1 is the observable brane, we can solve the gauge
and

hierarchy problem only if (y1) > 0. assuming that mpl = k2
e2((yj )(y1)) << 1 where j = 2, 3, we obtain:

1(k2+k3kc)2

k1

m (1)

gu t = mple 1

3 (y1) ,

(125)

if (y1) = 103.5 and 90, the gut scale in our world will be about tev and 105
gev, respectively. the ve-dimensional planck scale is 1048 gev and 1044 gev,
respectively.

for just one brane with positive tension case, the ressult is similar to that in

just above paragraph.

3.2 space-time m 4  r1/z2
now, we consider the space-time is m 4  r1/z2. similar to the section 2, the so-
lution with z2 symmetry and odd number of 3-branes in subsection 3.1 can also be
generalized to the case in which the fth dimension is r1/z2. one just introduces the
equivalence classes: y  y and i  th brane  (i)  th brane, and then, modules
the equivalence classes. noticing that the brane tension v0 is half of the original value,
i. e., v0 = 3k0m 3
x, we obtain the sum of brane tensions is positive, too. in short, the
results are similar to that in above subsection except that the range of y is from 0 to
+. and we will have m+1 brane with positions y0 = 0 < y1 < y2 < ... < ym < +.

j=1 kj, we obtain the the general solution to (y) is:

assuming that kt = pm

(y) =

m

xi=0

ki|y  yi| + kt y + c .

and the corresponding 4-dimensional planck scale is:

m 2

(126)

(127)

(128)

(129)

and if i,i+1 = 0, then

i,i+1 =

(130)

(131)

(132)

by the way, one can easily prove that ti,i+1 is positive, which makes sure that the
4-dimensional planck scale is positive.

in addition, the four-dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m (i)

gu t is related to

the ve-dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m5(i)

gu t :

m (i)

gu t = m5(i)

gu t e(yi) .

(133)

now, we discuss the example, for two brane case, it is equivalent to above
3-brane case with z2 symmetry, so, we donot discuss it here. we discuss three 3-
brane case: their positions are: y0 = 0, y1, y2, respectively, and the values of the
1
brane tensions divided by 6m 3
2 k0, k1, k2, respectively. therefore, noticing
kt = k1 + k2, we obtain:

x are:

(y) =

ki|y  yi| + (k1 + k2)y + c ,

(y0) = k1y1 + k2y2 + c ,

(y1) = k0y1 + k2(y2  y1) + (k1 + k2)y1 + c ,

if there exists at least two branes which have positive tensions. without loss
of generality, assuming the brane with position y0 has positive tension, (y0) < (y1),
and (y0) < (y2). if e2((y1)(y0)) << 1 and e2((y2)(y0)) << 1, we obtain

(139)

if the brane with position yj where j = 1, 2 is the observable brane, we can solve the
gauge hierarchy problem. assuming mx = 2k0, we obtain:

m (j)

gu t = mple((yj )(y0)) .

(140)

20

so, we can push the gut scale in our world to tev scale and 105 gev scale range
if (yj)  (y0) = 34.5 and 30, respectively. and the value of (y0) determines the
relation between mpl and mx.
if the brane with position y0 is the observable brane, the gauge hierarchy prob-
lem can be solved only if (y0) > 0. assuming that mpl = 2k0 and e2((yj )(y0)) << 1
where j = 1, 2, we obtain:

m (0)

gu t = mple 1

3 (y0) ,

(141)

with (y0) = 103.5 and 90, we can have gut scale in our world at tev scale and
105 gev scale, respectively. the ve-dimensional planck scale is 1048 gev and 1044
gev, respectively.

for just one brane with positive tension case, the discussion is similar to that

in just above paragraph.

3.3 space-time m 4  s1
now we consider the fth dimension is s1, i. e., the space-time is m 4  s1. assuming
we have l + m + 1 parallel 3-branes, and their fth coordinastes are:   yl <
yl+1 < ... < y1 < y0 < y1 < ... < ym1 < ym < . the lagrangian, the einstein
equation and the dierential equations of (y) are the same as that in subsection 3.1,
except we require that: |y|  , () = (), and the dention of (y). the
(y) is dened as the following:

(y) =

m

i ((y  yi1)  (y  yi)) + ((y  ym)

xi=l+1
+(y + yl)) .

the general solution to the dierential equations of (y) is:

(y) =

m

xi=l

ki|y  yi| + kcy + c .

(142)

(143)

the relations between the ki and vi, and the relations between the ki and i

are:

(144)

(145)

(146)

i = 6m 3
x(

kj  kc)2 ,

vi = 6kim 3

x ,
i1

xj=i

kj

d(y)

dy is a piece-wise continuous function or sectionally continuous function for
it has nite jumps because of nite branes, and the jump is 2ki when it pass the i th
brane. in fact, d(y)
dy is sectional constant. in addition, if starting a point not belong
to any brane, we wind around the circle one times, the sum of jump is 2pm
i=l ki

21

which is equal to zero for d(y)
the brane tensions should be zero, or

dy is sectional constant. therefore, we obtain the sum of

m

xj=l

kj = 0 .

in addition, from () = (), we obtain:

m

xj=l

kjyj = kc .

and the corresponding 4-dimensional planck scale is:

m 2

pl = m 3

 ,

tm,l = 

1

2kc (cid:16)e2(yl)  e2(ym)(cid:17) ,

tm,l = (2 + yl  ym) e2(yl) ,

where if kc 6= 0, then

and if kc = 0, then

if i,i+1 6= 0, then

and if i,i+1 = 0, then

where

ti,i+1 =

1

2i,i+1 (cid:16)e2(yi+1)  e2(yi)(cid:17) ,

ti,i+1 = (yi+1  yi)e2(yi) ,

i,i+1 =

kj  kc .

(147)

(148)

(149)

(150)

(151)

(152)

(153)

(154)

as before, one can easily prove that ti,i+1 is positive, which makes sure that the
4-dimensional planck scale is positive.

in addition, the four-dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m (i)

gu t is related to

the ve-dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m5(i)

gu t :

m (i)

gu t = m5(i)

gu t e(yi) .

(155)

this solution can be generalized to the solution with z2 symmetry. there
are four kinds of such models, two kinds of such models have odd number of branes,
the other two have even number of branes. for the odd number of branes: (i) one

22

requires that: ki = ki, yi = yi, m = l and kc = 0. (ii) one requires that: ki = ki,
yi = yi for 1  i  m, l = m + 1, k0 = 0 (no number 0 brane), yl =  and
kc = kl. for the even number of branes; (i) one requires that ki = ki, yi = yi,
m = l, k0 = 0 (no number 0 brane) and kc = 0.
(ii) ki = ki, yi = yi, for
1  i  m, l = m + 1, k0 6= 0, yl =  and kc = kl.

let us discuss two simple models.
(i) three brane case: their positions are y1, y2, y3, respectively, and the values
x are: k1, (k1 + k3), k3, respectively, where

of the brane tensions divided by 6m 3
k1 > 0, k3 > 0. therefore, we obtain:

(y) = k1|y  y1|  (k1 + k3)|y  y2| + k3|y  y3| + kcy + c .

the constraint equation is

and

k1y1  (k1 + k3)y2 + k3y3 = kc .

(y1) = kc( + y1) + c ,

(156)

(157)

(158)

(159)

(160)

(y2) = 2k1(y2  y1) + kc( + y2) + c ,

(y3) = kc(y3  ) + c .

without loss of generality, we assume kc > 0, and then, obtain (y3) < (y1) < (y2).

the four-dimensional planck scale are

m 2

pl = m 3

k3

(2k3  kc)kc

e2kc(y3)2c .

(161)

(162)

because of the constraint equation, 2k3  kc > 0. if the brane with position y1 is
the observable brane, we can solve the gauge hierarchy problem. assuming mx =
(2k3kc)kc

, we obtain:

k3

m (1)

gu t = mplekc(2+y1y3) .

(163)
so, we can push the gut scale in our world to tev scale and 105 gev scale range if
kc(2 + y1  y3) = 34.5 and 30, respectively. and the value of (y3) determines the
relation between mpl and mx.
if the brane with position y3 is the observable brane, we can solve the gauge hi-

erarchy problem only if (y3) > 0. assuming that mpl = (2k3kc)kc
1, we obtain:

k3

and e2((y1)(y3)) <<

m (3)

gu t = mple 1

3 (y3) ,

(164)

23

with (y3) = 103.5 and 90, we can have gut scale in our world at tev scale and
105 gev scale, respectively. the ve-dimensional planck scale is 1048 gev and 1044
gev, respectively.

(ii) four brane with z2 symmetry case. the branes positions are y2 = ,
y1 = y1, y0 = 0, y1, respectively, and the values of the brane tension divided
by 6m 3
x are: 2k2, (k0 + k2), 2k0, (k0 + k2), respectively, where k0 > 0, k2 > 0.
therefore, we obtain:

(y) = (k2 + k0)(|y  y1| + |y + y1|) + 2k0|y| + c ,

then,

(y2) = 2k2 + c , (y0) = 2(k2 + k0)y1 + c ,

(y1) = (y1) = 2k2y1 + c .

the four-dimensional planck scale are

(166)

(167)

(168)

without loss of generality, we assume that k0 > 0, and (y2) < (y0) or k2(k2 +
k0)y1 > 0. if the brane with position y0 is the observable brane, the gauge hierarchy
problem can also be solved. assuming that e2((y0)(y2)) << 1, and mx = 2k2,
one obtains:

(169)
so, one can push the gut scale in our world to tev scale and 105 gev scale range
if (y0)  (y2) = 2(k2  (k2 + k0)y1) = 34.5 and 30, respectively. and the value
of (y2) determines the relation between mpl and mx.

gu t = mple((y0)(y2)) .

m (0)

3.4 space-time m 4  s1/z2
the solution with z2 symmetry in the last subsection can also be generalized to the
case in which the fth dimension is s1/z2. one just requires that ki = ki, yi = yi,
for 1  i  m, l = m + 1, yl = , and kc = kl, then introduces the equivalence
classes: y  y and i  th brane  (i)  th brane for i = 1, ..., m. after module
the eqivalence classes, we obtain the models on m 4  s1/z2. we renumber l  th
brane as (m + 1)  th brane, so, ym+1 = . using splitting brane method, we
obtain the brane tension v0 and vm+1 is half of the original value, i. e., v0 = 3k0m 3
x,
vm+1 = 3km+1m 3
x. of course, the sum of the brane tensions is zero, too. and we will
have m + 2 branes with position y0 = 0 < y1 < ... < ym < ym+1 = . by the way,

k0 + km+1 + 2pm

the solution of (y) is:

i=1 ki = 0.

(y) = k0|y| +

m

xi=1

ki(|y  yi| + |y + yi|) + c .

(170)

24

and we can rewrite it as

(y) =

m

xi=1

ki|y  yi| + kt y + c ,

where kt = 1

2(k0  km+1).

and the corresponding 4-dimensional planck scale is:

where if i,i+1 6= 0, then

ti,i+1 =

and if i,i+1 = 0, then

4-dimensional planck scale is positive.

in addition, the four-dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m (i)

gu t is related to

the ve-dimensional gut scale on i-th brane m5(i)

gu t :

m (i)

gu t = m5(i)

gu t e(yi) .

(176)

now, we discuss the simple example. the three brane case is equivalent to
above four 3-brane case with z2 symmetry module the equivalence classes. so, we
will not discuss three 3-brane case, here. we discuss four 3-brane case: their positions
are y0 = 0, y1, y2, y3 = , respectively, and the values of the brane tension divided
by 6m 3
2(k1  k2 + kt ), respectively, where
k1 > 0, k2 > 0. therefore, we obtain:

2(k1 + k2 + kt ), k1, k2,  1

x are:

1

(y) = kt y + k1|y  y1|  k2|y  y2| + c ,

(y0) = k1y1  k2y2 + c ,

(y1) = k2(y2  y1) + kt y1 + c ,
(y2) = k1(y2  y1) + kt y2 + c ,

(y3) = (k1  k2 + kt )  (k1y1  k2y2) + c .

without loss of generality, we assume that kt > 0 and k2 + kt > k1. then, the
brane at y0 has positive tension and (y0) < (y1). assuming e2((yj )(y0)) << 1 for
j = 1, 2, 3, and mx = 2(k2 + kt  k1), if the brane with position y1 is the observable
brane, we can solve the gauge hierarchy problem:

m (1)

gu t = mple(k2k1+kt )y1 .

(183)

so, we can push the gut scale in our world to tev scale and 105 gev scale range if
(k2  k1 + kt )y1 = 34.5 and 30, respectively. and the value of (y0) determines the
relation between mpl and mx.
if the brane with position y0 is the observable brane, one can solve the gauge
hierarchy problem only if (y0) > 0, i. e., k1y1 > k2y2. assuming that mpl =
2(k2 + kt  k1) and e2(k2k1+kt )y1 << 1, one obtains:
3 (y0) ,

gu t = mple 1

m (0)

(184)

with (y0) = 103.5 and 90, one can push the gut scale in our world to tev scale
and 105 gev scale range, respectively. the ve-dimensional planck scale is 1048 gev
and 1044 gev, respectively.

4 conclusion

if the fth dimension is one-dimensional connected manifold, up to dieomorphic, the
only possible space-time will be m 4  r1, m 4  r1/z2, m 4  s1 and m 4  s1/z2.
and there exist two possibilities on cosmology constant: the cosmology constant is
constant along the fth dimension, and the cosmology constant is sectional constant
along the fth dimension. for any point in m 4  r1, m 4  r1/z2, m 4  s1 and
m 4  s1/z2, which is not belong to any brane and the section where the cosmology
constant is zero, there is a neighborhood which is dieomorphic to ( or a slice of )
ads5 space. we construct the general models with parallel 3-branes on those kinds of
the space-time and with constant/sectional constant cosmology constant, and point
out that for compact fth dimension, the sum of the brane tensions is zero, for non-
compact fth dimension, the sum of the brane tensions is positive. we assume the
observable brane which includes our world should have positive tension, and conclude
that in those general scenarios, the 5-dimensional gut scale on each brane can be
indentied as the 5-dimensional planck scale, but, the 4-dimensional planck scale is
generated from the low 4-dimensional gut scale exponentially in our world. we also
give some simple models to show explicitly how to solve the gauge hierarchy problem.
