(3.7) (3.8) taking account (3.6), (3.7) value u0 (3.8) return (3.2) compute total energy quark-antiquark conguration eq q = dy e/2 2u0 2 z 1 211/2u0 q z 1 dy 1 log (yu0/) y2 y4 1 y4 1 y2 . (3.9) (3.10) since uv cuto energy << u0 approach log (yu0/) = log + log u0/ logl0/l used relation (3.8) l0 = r2 l << l0. therefore found leading contribution energy (1/4)2 uv cuto distance 03/2 eq q = 27q1/2 (1/4)2 1 l log (l0/l) z 1 dy y2 y4 1 .

(4.8) therefore, found eective coupling heavy monopole antimonopole zero-charge type shows inverse log dependence 1 g2 1 log (l0/l) (4.9) compared 1 g2 e dirac condition (3.13). hence electric magnetic coupling constants verify ge(l)gm(l) = 1 (4.10) destroyed running coupling constant. 5 conclusion acknowledgments dual gravity description non-supersymmetric gauge theories used paper check dirac relation electric magnetic charges rg invariant (at least logarithmic approximation). seems necessary 8 element self-consistency theory. also shown theory running coupling constant rather proportional exp(/2) exp() one could expect. fact square logarithm exp() crucial obtain correct renormalization magnetic coupling constant. answer question coupling constant square root might expect naively seems open important question. nice nd running coupling constant theory using approaches, example studying instanton eects plan return issue future. grateful a. tseytlin m. gaberdiel useful conversations. work g.l. supported spanish fpu programme grant fp9717442117.
