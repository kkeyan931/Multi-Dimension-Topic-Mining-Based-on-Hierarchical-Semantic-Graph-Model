abstract

recently proposed new gauge invariant formulation of the chern-simons gauge theory is con-
sidered in detail. this formulation is consistent with the gauge xed formulation. furthermore
it is found that the canonical (noether) poincare generators are not gauge invariant even on
the constraints surface and do not satisfy the poincare algebra contrast to usual case. it is
the improved generators, constructed from the symmetric energy-momentum tensor, which are
(manifestly) gauge invariant and obey the quantum as well as classical poincare algebra. the
physical states are constructed and it is found in the schrodinger picture that unusual gauge
invariant longitudinal mode of the gauge eld is crucial for constructing the physical wave-
functional which is genuine to (pure) chern-simons theory. in matching to the gauge xed
formulation, we consider three typical gauges, coulomb, axial and weyl gauges as explicit ex-
amples. furthermore, recent several confusions about the eect of diracs dressing function and
the gauge xings are claried. the analysis according to old gauge independent formulation
a la dirac is summarized in an appendix.

i. introduction

in general, there are two approaches in quantum eld theory: the gauge invariant formula-
tion (gif) and the gauge xed formulation (gff). the latter is the conventional one, where
one chooses a gauge. in the former what we are interested in this paper on the other hand, one
does not x the gauge but works with gauge invariant quantities. there are several methods
which achieve this former approach depending on what one chooses the gauge invariant vari-
ables [1, 2, 3, 4] and his interests. in this paper, we consider the formalism a la dirac [5] which
provides one of the simplest formulation and whose validity is independent on the space-time
dimensions and the treating models in principle.

the idea of the diracs gauge invariant formalism is to describe all physical eect by the
manifestly gauge invariant variables, called physical variables by introducing diracs dressing
function ck(x, y): the physical variables are dened as the quantities which commute with
all rst-class constraints within the hamiltonian formulation, which are believed to be directly
measurable ones, such that the gauge xing condition needs not be introduced . if this procedure
is succeeded, the model is said to be gauge invariant within that formulation; usually this was
trivial thing at classical level but non-trivial at quantum level even for the gauge theories which
have the gauge invariance of lagrangian (density) [5].

recently this gauge invariant method using the diracs gauge invariant variables has been
of considerable interest in the pertubative analysis of qed and qcd, especially in relation
to the infrared divergence and quark connement problems [6]. however as for the formalism
itself, it is not clear how the results in gif can be matched to gff even though this matching
has been considered in several recent analyzes [7].

furthermore, a similar gauge independent hamiltonian analysis [8] a la dirac [5, 9] has been
recently considered for the chern-simons (cs) gauge theory with matter elds [10]. actually
after the cs gauge theory was invented, there arose several debates about the gauge dependence
of the spin and statistics transmutation phenomena for the charged matter elds, since the
analysis was carried out with specic gauge xing [10, 11, 12]. so, with the formulation without
gauge xing, one can expect to resolve this debate since one is not conned to a specic
gauge. but the result of the recent gauge independent analysis for this problem in ref. [8] was
questionable since there was no room for spin transmutation. this was in sharp contrast to the
well-known spin transmutation of gff [10, 11, 12].

this paper is devoted to a detailed study of our new gauge invariant hamiltonian formu-
lation that has been recently suggested as a resolution of these problems [13]. in sec. ii, we
introduce a physically plausible assumption for the poincare transformation of the diracs gauge
invariant elds that these elds transform conventionally to the space and time transforma-
tion. as a result we nd a new set of equations for dirac dressing function ck(x, y). however,

2

these elds do not transform conventionally under the spatial rotation and lorentz boost. in
sec. iii, we consider quantization. it is found that the gauge invariant eld operators satisfy
the graded commutation (exchange) relations depending on the dressing, and physical states
are constructed as the products of the gauge invariant eld operators with the gauge invariant
vacuum state algebraically. this is compared to the physical wavefunctional in the schrodinger
picture and it is found, as a genuine eect of the (pure) cs theory, that the gauge invariant
but longitudinal mode of the gauge eld ai is important as well as the usual gauge varying
longitudinal mode which carries full gauge transformation property of ai. moreover, it is shown
that the improved generators, constructed from the symmetric (belinfante) energy-momentum
tensor [14], which are (manifestly) gauge invariant, obey the poincare algebra. but we show
that canonical (noether) poincare generators are not gauge invariant even on the constraints
surface and do not satisfy the poincare algebra. these results are valid even at the quantum
level as well as as the classical ones. the inequivalence of the improved and canonical genera-
tors is essentially due to the cs term, and is important for genuine spin transmutation in the
relativistic cs gauge theory. furthermore the fact that only the symmetric energy-momentum
tensor, not the canonical one, is meaningful is consistent with einsteins theory of gravity. in
sec. iv, we provide and explain our recently proposed method which matches gif to gff con-
sistently. the coulomb, axial and weyl gauges are considered as explicit examples. moreover
we clarify several confusions which result from the misunderstanding the gauge xing kernel
and the dressing function. sec. v is devoted to the discussion and summary. as discussion,
we have considered the manifestly gauge invariant action and its possible generalization which
is connected to the known equivalence of the self-dual and maxwell-cs theories. in appendix
a, we consider the old dirac formalism for the determination of the extended poincare gener-
ators and we nd that this formulation is valid only when one neglects the singular boundary
terms. in appendix b, we derive the physical wavefunction of the maxwell-cs theory in the
schrodinger picture in our context and with emphasis on the dierence to the (pure) cs theory.
in appendix c, we present the proof of the master formula for the matching of gif and gff.

ii. new gauge invariant formulation

a. diracs gauge invariant variables

our model is the abelian cs gauge theory with massive relativistic complex scalars [8, 10]

which is described by the lagrangian density

l =


2

aa + (d)(d)  m2,

(1)

where 012 = 1, g=diag(1,1,1), and d =  + ia. this lagrangian density is invariant
up to the total divergence under the gauge transformations (x)  exp[i(x)](x), a(x) 

3

a(x) + (x), where  is a well-behaved function such that  = 0. as a reection
of this symmetry, there are the rst-class constraints

t0  0  0,
t  j0  b  0,

(2)

(3)

which are the primary and secondary constraints, respectively, and there is also a second class-
class constraints ti  i  
2 ijaj  0 (i = 1, 2), which results from the symplectic structure of
(1) in the diracs canonical formalism. here, j0 is the time component of the conserved matter
current j = i[(d) d] and b = ijiaj is the magnetic eld. but all of them are not
crucial in the development of our formulation: it is found that only the secondary constraints
t  0 is the non-trivial one. actually, the faddeev-jackiw (fj) (or symplectic) bracket method
does the work properly and in this method the basic (equal time) poisson brackets (called fj
or symplectic) brackets [15]) become

1


ij2(x  y),

{ai(x), aj(y)} =
{(x), (y)} = {(x), (y)} = 2(x  y),
others vanish

(4)

with  = (d0),  = d0, and there remains only the (gauss law) constraint t (x)  0: in
this fj method, the primary constraints of the dirac bracket method, t0  0, ti  0, need
not be introduced.

now in order to develop the manifestly gauge invariant hamiltonian formulation we intro-

duce the following variables

(x)  (x)exp (iw (x)) ,
(x)  (x)exp (iw (x)) ,
a(x)  a(x)  w (x),

and their complex conjugates with

w (x) = z d2z ck(x, z)ak(z).

(5)

(6)

these variables are manifestly gauge invariant, i.e., {t (x),f(y)} = 0, f = (ai, , ) in the
hamiltonian formulation3 if the dirac dressing function ck(x, z) satises

3in order to include a0 also in this category, one could introduce r d2x (0)0 as a temporal-gauge trans-
formation with {a0(x), 0(y)} = 2(x  y) in addition to (4).

z ck(x, z) = 2(x  z).
k

(7)

4

here, we note that there are innitely many solutions of ck(x, z) which satisfy (7) and the gauge
invariance of the variables in (5) should be understood on each solution hyper-surface but not
on the entire solution space: this will be discussed in detail in sec. iv.
moreover, we note that the decomposition of the base gauge elds as

is not always the same as the usual decomposition to the transverse and longitudinal components

ai(x) = ai(x) + iw (x)

(8)

ai(x) = at

i (x) + al

i (x)

(9)

with   at = 0 and   al = 0: although (ai, iw ) is similar to (at
i ) in that the rst
parts do not gauge transform and only the second parts gauge transform, ai does not always
satisfy the divergence-free condition:

i , al

iai(x) = iai(x) +z d2z 2

xck(x  z)ak(z)

6= 0.

(10)

[the transformation between these two decomposition method will be discussed in detail in sec.
iii. b; it will be shown also that ai satises more generalized condition, and this generalized
condition reduces to the divergence-free condition for a particular form of ck(x z) in sec. iv.]
on the other hand, in the usual decomposition (9), the gauge invariant variables (5) for the
matter elds are found to be

(x) = (x)exphi1
(x) = (x)exphi1
i al

i (x)i ,
i al
i (x)i

(11)

when the zero-mode of the operator ii = 2 is unimportant such that 22 = 1 [1
i2 and 2 is dened as the ordered equation 22 = 1]4 in the coulomb gauge.

i 

b. poincare transformation of gauge invariant elds

in order to give some physical meaning to the gauge invariant elds (5), the transforma-
tion properties under the poincare generators should be dened. to this end, let us consider

4recently the replacement (x)  (x)ei1

i (x), which is the same as what one uses when he wants
to remove the gauge dependent al
i part in the rst order form of the lagrangian, has been understood as a
darboux transformation in the context of the hamiltonian reduction [15] : although they didnt use  explicitly,
their renamed eld  in the right-hand side is nothing but  in our formulation.

invariant elds and di  i + iai:

p 0

s = z d2xh||2 + |di |2 + m2| |2i ,
s = z d2xhdi  + (di )i ,
s = z d2x ijxihdj  + (dj )i ,

m 0i

s = x0p i

s z d2x xih||2 + |dj |2 + m2| |2i .

these are improved generators following the terminology of callan et al. [16] constructed from
the symmetric (belinfante) energy-momentum tensor t 

[14] :

where  = d0  = (0 + ia0)  and i = r d3xl. though the gauge invariance of p 
(12) is manifest (at least classically), there can be added additional term   r d2x [u(x)t (x)+

u0(x)t0(x)], which is proportional to the (rst-class) constraints, to generate the correct poincare
transformations for the undressed base elds  and a [9]. however, we note that as far as we
are interested in the dynamics of the physically relevant variables of (5), we do not need this
additional term  in the poincare generators of (12) [8, 9] since  has the vanishing poisson
bracket with the gauge invariant variables f. (see appendix a for the xing the constraints
term  from the transformation properties of the undressed base elds a la dirac.) then, the
generators in (12) should generate the correct transformation for the f; but this will depend
on how the variables f are dened.
in the followings, we will dene the gauge invariant canonical elds f = (ai, , ), which
appear in the poincare generators, as what involving a particle-like object and investigate what
information can be obtained from this denition.

1. space and time translations

first of all, we consider the spatial translation generated by

{ (x), p j

s } = j(x)eiw (x) + i(x)eiw (x)z d2z ck(x, z)i

zak(z)

6

= j (x)  i (x)z d2zhj

zck(x, z) + j

xck(x, z)i ak(z).

dropped the terms r d2z i

z(cid:16)ck(x, z)ak(z)(cid:17) andr d2z k

from the second to third lines, the integration by parts has been performed and we have
z (ck(x, z)aj(z)) , which vanish for su-
ciently rapidly decreasing integrand. this seems to show the translational anomaly due to the
second term. ( following the terminology of hagen et al. [10, 11, 12], anomaly means an un-
conventional contribution whose origin is at the classical level.) however, this anomaly should
not appear in order that  responds conventionally to translations, i.e., { (x), p j
s } = j (x)
like as the particle-like object which is described by the local elds: the usual local elds have
no translational anomaly, even though they have additional terms in the rotation because of
their spin or other properties.5 from this property, we obtain the condition that ck(x, z) be
translation invariant

i.e.,

i
zck(x, z) = i

xck(x, z),

ck(x, z) = ck(x  z).

(13)

(14)

this results would be also easily anticipated ones if the base elds  and ai are translationally
invariant as well. but this is not always necessary to derive (14). actually in this case the base
elds are not translationally invariant under the generators of (12)6,

{(x), p j
{ai(x), p j
{a0(x), p j

s} = dj(x),
1
s } = ij

s } = 0,

j0(x)  f j

i(x),

but the translationally non-invariant terms cancel each others in the gauge invariant combina-
tion (5). furthermore, the condition (13) or (14) also guarantees the correct spatial translation

 x (

 = 

5similar assumption has been recently considered independently in a dierent context by bagan et al. [17]
6these unconventional coordinate transformations on elds can be understood as the gauge-covariant
coordinate transformation [18, 19] f a  lf a  (f a) = f f, f   lf   if a = f ( +
ia) under the coordinate transformation f x = f (x) [f =constant for space-time translation, f  =
) for the space rotation and lorentz boost], where lf denotes the lie derivative; the

discrepancies about a0 transformation can be traced back to the (strong) implementation of the constraint
0  0 which is the gauge transformation generator of a0. by recovering 0 in the poincare generator complete
equivalence will be obtained. these results are consistent with the fact that, by introducing the (rst-class)
constraints terms additionally into the poincare generator, one can obtain the correct coordinate transformations
as is shown in appendix a: the additional constraints terms compensate the gauge transformation part with
gauge function f a in the gauge-covariant coordinate transformation f and the correct transformations
f a = lf a, f  = lf  are obtained. we thank prof. r. jackiw for suggesting this way of understanding.

law for all other gauge invariant elds in f 7:

{f(x), p j

s} = jf(x), f = (ai, , ).

similarly, by considering the time translation

{ (x), p 0

s } = 0(x)eiw (x) + i(x)eiw (x)z d2z ck(x  z)0

z ak(z)

= 0 (x)  i (x)z d2z 0 (ck(x  z)) ak(z)
z (ck(x  z)a0(z)) van-
we obtain the correct time translation if the boundary integral r d2z k
ishes and ck(x  z) be time independent. this property is also satised for all other gauge
invariant elds and the results read in a compact form

contrast to this, the transformation for the base elds are not correctly generated, i.e.,

{f(x), p 0

s } = 0f(x).

{(x), p 0
{ai(x), p 0
{a0(x), p 0

s } = d0(x),
1
s } = ij

s } = 0.

jj(x) = f 0

i(x),

2. space rotations and lorentz boost

for the space rotation and lorentz boost, contrast to the translations, the anomalies are
present even in the transformation for f  since in that case they represent the spin or other
properties of f. the brackets with the rotation generator are expressed as

{ (x), m 12

s } = ijxi(j + iaj)(x)eiw (x) + i(x)eiw (x)z d2z ck(x  z)zk 1



j0(z)

= ijxij (x)  i12(x) (x),

{ai(x), m 12

s } = jkxjkai(x)  ijaj(x)  x

= jkxjkai(x)  ijaj(x) + i12(x),

i z d2z ck(x  z)hjlzjl

zak(z)  kjaj(z)i

and the brackets with the lorentz boost are

{ (x), m 0j

s } = (x0j  xj0)(x)eiw (x)

+ i(x)eiw (x)z d2z ck(x  z)h(z0j

z  zj0)ak(z) + kja0(z)i

7correct transformation for a0 also can be obtained by reviving the 0 term in the poincare generators

similar to what was noted in the footnote 3. see appendix a for detail.

 x

= x0jai(x)  xj0ai(x)  ija0 + i0j(x)(x);

z  zj0)ak(z) + kja0(z)i

or in the compact form these are expressed as follows

s } = xf(x)  xf(x) + 
{f(x), m 
(x) = i(x) (x),


 (x) = i(x) (x),

for the space rotation and lorentz transformations, respectively, which show the incorrect
transformation for the gauge varying base elds; we must supplement the constraint term  in
order to give the correct transformation even for the gauge varying base elds as well as the
gauge invariant elds f. the anomalous term 
 for the transformation of f in (15) is
gauge invariant because it is expressed only with the f. at rst, it seems odd that the gauge

9

invariant variables do have the anomaly, but as will be clear in later section, these variables are
nothing but the hagens rotational anomaly term and other gauge restoring terms in gff. this
will be treated in sec. iv. but here, it will be interesting to note that a can be re-expressed
completely by the matter currents as

ai(x) = ai(x) z d2z x

= ai(x) z d2z ck(x  z) (fki(z)  kai(z))

(16)

(17)

: the third lines in (16) and (17) are just the results of integration by parts without recourse
to the particular properties of cs theory; in the last steps we used the constraint t  0 and
the euler-lagrange equation of (1), f 0k =  1
 kjj j , respectively, which are genuine to the cs
theory. it is remarkable that the expressions (16) and (17) in terms of j , which solves the
constraint and equation of motion, were obtained without solving the dierential equations but
from the simple algebraic manipulation by imposing the constraint and equation of motion.
moreover, the anomalous terms are, then, expressed as

12 =

1

 z d2z (xk  zk)ck(x  z)j0(z)
 z d2z (xi  zi)ck(x  z)kjj j(z).

(18)

these solutions are similar to the coulomb gauge solution [10] and hence imply the similarity
of gif to gff with the coulomb gauge in particular.8 (this will be discussed again in sec. iv.
a in a dierent context.) however it should be noted that the lorentz anomaly does not occur
in the transformation of the current j , even though a, which is expressed by j  as given
above, does have the anomaly: this will be connected to the fact that the anomaly depends
on the dressing ck(x  z) but j  is already gauge invariant without recourse to that dressing.

8this has the same origin to what has been observed in a dierent context in ref. [15]

iii. quantization

here, we note that the quantum commutation relations in (19) are not gauge independent
because the involved eld operators ai
op, op, ... etc. are gauge varying ones. so, we rst
consider the commutation (or exchange) relations for the gauge invariant variables f 
op which
are more basic objects in our formulation.

a. operator exchange relations

at the classical level, the basic brackets between the gauge invariant canonical elds f 

become as follows

range commutes: only for the non-abelian case, the path-ordering is needed9. these results
look like the graded commutation relations of the anyon eld [21] but it is found that this is
not the case always [10, 22] . this will be treated in the sec. v in detail.

9 if we consider the situation where are the crossings of the contours in the line integral representation of

w (x), the path-ordering is required [20]; see also footnote 21 in this paper for this problem.

b. physical states : algebraic construction

there is well-known way to construct the physical states: if the vacuum state |0i is a physical
state which satises (20), the state o(aiop, op, 
op) |0i, which is the power series function o,
is also a physical state [ this is because to |0i = ([t,o] + ot ) |0i = [t,o]|0i = 0 is satised
if o is gauge-invariant]. as a simplest case, let us consider the state

op(x) |0i .

(28)

then, it is found that this state has one unit charge at the operator position x of the operator
in addition to the vacuum charge

j0(y) op(x) |0i = n[j0(y), op(x)] + op(x)j0(y)o|0i

= h(x  y) + j0(y)i op(x) |0i ,

where we have used the commutation relation [j0(y), op(x)] = 2(x  y) op(x) and j0(y) is
the charge density of the vacuum at the position y. the state (28) has also the gauge eld
cloud around the position x of op(x) as

ai

op(y) op(x) |0i = n[ai
= " h

bop(y) op(x) |0i = ijy
= " h

op(y), op(x)] + op(x)ai
op(y)o|0i

i (cid:16)aj
2(x  y) + b(y)# op(x) |0i ,

op(y) op(x)(cid:17) |0i



(29)

(30)

where ai(y), b(y) are the elds of the vacuum at the point y and we have used the commutation
op(x)ikck(x  y) in (29): the state op(x) |0i has the gauge
op(y), op(x)] = h
relation, [ai

varying vector eld ai(y) = h
 ikck(x  y), as well as the gauge invariant point magnetic eld
 2(y x). this is understood as that the op(x) creates one charged particle
b(y)(= ijiaj) = h
at the position x together with the vector eld ai(y) and the point magnetic uxr d2y b(y) = h
 .
therefore, let us call op the charge-ux composite (cfc) operator. on the other hand, op(x)
creates one charged particle at x without gauge eld cloud, and eiwop(x) creates the point
magnetic ux at x without charge. [this situation is in contrast to the qed case where op(x)
creates the gauge invariant (physical) electron together with only the gauge invariant electric
eld [5, 6].] similarly, 
op annihilates one cfc operator and let us call it the anti-cfc one.
now, n cfc state becomes

is expressed as pm

with the c-number coecient ca. furthermore, more general state with n cfc and m anti-cfc
ops are placed to the right-
hand side of ops. in the case of (31), the cfc operators can be re-arranged as a factorized
form

in an appropriate order of ops and the rst exponential factor will show the multi-valuedness
under the exchanging any two cfcs if (xi  xi+1) does not vanish.

let me now consider nally the state ai

op(x) |0i . then, it is easy to see that this state does

not carry the charge nor magnetic ux in addition to the vacuum charge

j0(y)ai
b(y)ai

op(x) |0i = j0(y)ai
op(x) |0i = b(y)ai

op(x) |0i = (ih

with the c-number coecient ccba. here, we note that there seems to be no general reason
to omit the purely gauge eld ak
op part in this construction. however, that part is physically
doubtful because it can imply the independent gauge eld dynamics contrast to the nature
of the cs gauge eld. moreover, the representation of the physical states are not unique:
it depends on what gauge invariant operators are fundamental and the physical states with
dierent representations are not equivalent in general. as a more explicit approach, which
xes these problems and shows the more detailed form of the states, we consider the functional
schrodinger picture approach.

c. physical wavefunctional in schrondinger picture

in the previous section b, we have considered a general algebraic construction for the

especially in the schrodinger picture [23].

physe. in this section, we consider a more explicit way to construct them,

physical states (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

14

to go to the schrodinger picture, we must choose a representation for the eld commutation
relation (19). instead of taking the rotationally non-symmetric representations, which take one
(spatial) component of ai as the conjugate momenta of the other component [20], we take the
rotationally symmetric representation which shows the contents of the gauge invariant operators
more explicitly, as in the previous section b.

to this end, we note that ai can be expressed as

(33)
which solves the equation ijiaj = ijiaj = b with a gauge invariant scalar eld . the eld
 is determined as

j b + i

ai = ij1

by considering the divergence (10)

(x) = 2hiai(x) + 2w (x)i

(34)

iai(x) = iai(x) + 2w (x)

= 2(x).

using the expressions of (33) and (34), the base eld ai of (8) can be re-arranged as follows
ai = ij1
j b + i( + w ), where the rst term corresponds to the transverse component at
i ,
i of (9)10; but when the
and the second term corresponds to the longitudinal component al
zero-mode can be neglected, one nds that the combined quantity  + w  becomes the usual
form of the longitudinal mode which appears in (11):

 + w = 2iai  22w + w

= i2ai  w + w
= 1
= 1

i ai
i al
i .

(35)

now, let us consider a representation for the schrodinger picture. to this end, we rst
note that w (x) is the (unique) canonical conjugate of b while  is completely decoupled in
the canonical conjugate sector of b, and furthermore  can not be simultaneously diagonalized
with w from the commutation relations [we omit the subscript op hereafter]:

[w (x, b(y)] =

ih

[(x), b(y)] = 0,
ih

[w (x), (y)] =

2(x  y),

 2hiky

i ck(x  y)  2(x  y)i

6= 0.

10here, one nds that all the longitudinal parts are not participated in the gauge transformation but only

iw does the work

15

hence, for the representation with diagonalized w (x), b(y) will acts as a (functional) operators

b(y) |i 

h
i



w (y)

(w )

(36)

for any state functional (w ). this is a usual step that can be performed, although the detail
form of conjugate moment b is dierent from, theory to theories when ais commute with
themselves [see appendix b for the analysis about this usual case in our context], where  has
no important role in the construction of . now, here one meets an unusual situation where
the naive expectation (36) is not valid and  is crucial as well as w in the construction of  :
this results from the fact that neither w (x) nor (y) can be taken as an diagonalized base in
the scrodinger picture because of the commutation relations

[w (x), w (y)] =

[(x), (y)] = 

(x  y),

ih

ih
 2kk(x  y) +

ih


(x  y),

which all are non-vanishing in general.11 but the combination w = w +  results a vanishing
commutation relation [w (x), w (y)] = 0 for all eld points x and y [20] and hence w can be a
diagonalized base for a representation of the schrodinger picture but not w alone: hence, the
correct representation is

b(y) |i 

h
i



w (y)

(w )

instead of (36). in this representation, it is easy to see that the physical wavefunctional phys
(20), which satises the gauss law constraint, is any functional made of   eiw and 

eiw [: j0 : ih(  )]12



[b(x) : j0(x) :] phys = " h

11 for the coincident points x = y, one can make them vanish within a regularization prescription [24].
but, the general multi-particle states with the distinguishable positions can not be diagonalized with respect to
neither w nor .

equivalence.

; when the zero-mode is neglizable, , 
are nothing but the usual ones in (11) from the
relation (35). but our setting is more general than the usual one: in particular, in a polynomial
representation, it reads

and there is no factor of the purely gauge eld, in this case ij1
j b instead of ai. this
corresponds to a dierent representation from (32) and so this wavefunctional is not equivalent
to (32) in general: actually, there is a slight dierence in the purely gauge eld part compared
to (32). for two particles sector, for example it becomes

phys = (x)(y)

= ei(x)ei(y)e[w (x),(y)]+ 1

2 [(x),w (x)]+ 1

2 [(y),w (y)] (x) (y).

(38)

by separating ei and  parts: in the functional schrodinger approach, the full ak
op part, which
has the momenta b as well as , is not allowed in the form of (32) but only  part is allowed
and contributes to the physical states in the representation of (32), in a specic from as (38).
finally, we note that the time-independent functional schrodinger equation becomes

d. poincare algebra

17

as an important criterion of the consistency of the model, let us consider the poincare
algebra. in general, the quantum algebra can have some anomaly term compared to the classical
one [24] . but it is found that this is not the case in our model: classical algebra and quantum
algebra are the same with appropriate choice of ordering and prescription. to see this, we rst
note, after some calculation, that one can obtain the relation which is the most non-trivial one
in the dirac-schwinger conditions as follows,

ht 00
s (x), t 00

s (y)i = (cid:16)t 0i

s (x) + t 0i

s (y)(cid:17) i

x2(x  y).

using this condition, it is straightforward to nd the following quantum poincare algebra

[p 
[p 
[m 

s , p 
s , m 
s , m 

s ] = 0,
s ] = ih(p   p ),
s ] = ih(cid:16)m   m  + m   m (cid:17)

(39)

as well as the classical one. here, we have considered symmetric ordering for the quantum
generators in (39) and used the condition of nite matrix elements of the poincare generators.
on the other hand, there are canonical (noether) poincare generators which are usually
identical to the improved ones (12) on the constraint surface when one drops the boundary
terms. but this is not trivial matter in lower dimensions like as in (2+1)-dimensions since in
that case the boundary term should be treated more carefully [26] . moreover, in the chern-
simons theory the situation is more serious: the gauge varying bulk terms also appear in
the canonical generators contrast to the improved ones. let us describe this in detail. the
(classical) canonical poincare generators are dened as

p

c = z d2x t 0
c = z d2x hxt 0

here, we have also used the symmetric ordering for the quantum poincare generators and used
the prescription i2(0)  0 in order to remove the undesirable innities which arise from the
non-commuting ai at the same points; with these choices the quantum algebras are the same
as the classical ones.

in conclusion, it is the improved generators (12), constructed from the symmetric energy-
momentum tensor, which are (manifestly) gauge invariant and obey the quantum as well as

19

classical poincare algebra. hence these improved generators have a unique meaning consistently
with einsteins theory of gravity13; this will lead to the uniqueness of the anomalous spin of
the relativistic matter, which comes only from m 12
s . (detailed discussion will be presented in
sec. iv.)

iv. matching of gif and gff

so far, we have considered the manifestly gauge invariant formulation by introducing the
dirac dressing function. now, the interesting question is how the gauge invariant results are
matched to gauge xed results. actually, there have been some confusions about this issue
[5, 6, 7]. this will be claried in the subsection d and now we start by describing the correct
matching to gff which has been presented recently [13].

in order to perform the matching, we need two things. one is the formula, called master

formula

{la, lb}  {la, lb}d.

(41)

[the proof is presented in the appendix c and only the interpretation of the result is in
order here.] here la is any gauge invariant quantity, where the bracket with the rst-class
constraint t of (3) vanishes, {la, t}  0. the left-hand side of the formula (41) is the basic
bracket of las. the right-hand side of (41) is the dirac bracket with gauge xing function
 = 0, det|{, t}| 6= 0. moreover, in the latter case, since  = 0 can be strongly implemented,
la can be replaced by la| that represents the projection of la onto the surface  = 0. the left-
hand side is gauge independent by construction since las and the the basic bracket algebra
(4) are introduced gauge independently. on the other hand, the dirac bracket [9] depends
explicitly on the chosen gauge  in general. but there is one exceptional case, i.e., when
the dirac bracket is considered for the gauge invariant variables. our master formula (41)
explicitly show this exceptional case: the dirac bracket for the gauge invariant variables la
or their projection la| on the surface  = 0 are still gauge invariant and equal to the basic
bracket for the corresponding variables14.

13there may be other dierently improved generators depending on what gravity theory is chosen like as
in ref.
[16]. but we do not consider this possibility in this paper. moreover, the preferred property of the
symmetric energy-momentum tensor compared to canonical one by the gauge invariance was examined also by
deser and macarthy [27]. but they missed the important role of the gauge invariance, which is genuine for the
cs gauge theory, on the integrated quantities, poincare generators.

14 for the rst-class constraint t , it was known in ref. [28]; this formula was implicitly included also in the
recently developed batalin-fradkin-tyutin formalism [29]. but, the formula (41) is valid even for the second-
class constraint t and this fact has done an important role in the diracs canonical analysis of the boundary
cs theory consistently to the symplectic reduction method [30].

20

another important thing for the matching is to know how the dening equation (7) for
ck(x  y) is modied in gff. by considering  (or a) in a specic gauge and the residual
gauge transformation of  and a, one can nd modied (but still make  be gauge invariant)
equation for ck(x y). here we will consider the following three typical cases with the resultant
modied equations of ck(x  y):

a) coulomb gauge (iai  0) : z d2z cj(x  z)aj(z) = 0,
b) axial gauge (a1  0) : 2
c) weyl gauge (a0  0) : j

z c2(x  z) = 2(x  z),
zcj(x  z) = 2(x  z).

(42)

these results are generally valid for any other gauge theories when they are formulated by our
gauge invariant formulation. note that these results are dierent from recent claims of ref. [6]
except in the case of coulomb gauge15. moreover, the weyl gauge does not modify the equation
for ck from (7). then, using these relations and (41), we can consider the gauge xed results
directly from gif. however, as can be observed in these examples, gauge xings restrict the
solution space in general. therefore, all the variables which appear in (15) are gauge invariant
for each solution hyper-surface which is selected by gauge xing, but their functional form may
be dierent depending on the chosen gauges. let us derive the results of (42) in detail and the
matching to gff using them.

a. coulomb gauge (iai  0)

it is important to note that in this gauge, there is no residual gauge symmetry:

if we
consider the gauge transformation, i.e., ai  ai + i,  should satisfy the laplace equation
2(x) = 0 over all space-times and so this equation has only one trivial solution (x) = 0. on
the other hand, since the gauge transformation of  is dened as what makes di = i + iai as
a covariant derivative when acted upon ,  does not transform (modular unimportant global
phase transformation), either. hence, it is found that the additional factor w , which cancels
the gauge transformations of ai and , is unnecessary or it can be made to be zero simply, i.e.,

w (x) = z d2z cj(x, z)aj(z) = 0.

(43)

in this case, the gauge invariant variables in (5) and the corresponding base elds are equivalent,
i.e., a = a,  = ,  =  and thus the solution of a in this gauge can be directly read from
[6, 7] considered r d2z cj(x  z)aj (z) = 0 even b) and c) cases. but then, the
manifestly gauge invariant elds in (5) are not gauge invariant under the residual gauge symmetries  
ei, a  a +  with x1 and x0 independent  for b) and c), respectively.

using these results, one nds that the basic brackets dened in (21) are the usual dirac brackets
in the coulomb gauge

{ai(x),aj(y)}d(coulomb)  {ai(x), aj(y)}d(coulomb) = 0,
{ (x), (y)}d(coulomb)  {(x), (y)}d(coulomb) = 0,
{ai(x), (y)}d(coulomb)  {ai(x), (y)}d(coulomb) = 

i

2

ik

(x  z)k
|x  z|2 (y).

furthermore, these two results imply that the gauge invariant operator op satises the boson
commutation relation, [ op(x), op(y)] = 0 in this case instead of the generic graded commu-
tation relations (26). here, we note the special importance of the coulomb gauge in that the
original elds , , a themselves are already gauge invariant elds because of the result (43)
and hence they already have the full anomaly structures of (15). furthermore, this gauge is the
simplest one to obtain the anomalous spin of the original matter eld  as 12 of (48) since this
does not have other gauge restoring terms as in the rotationally non-symmetric gauge. this is
made clear by noting the relation of (40)

11, 12] (unconventional) and 0 (conventional) in m 12
s , respectively: because of the gauge
independence of the surface terms, only the calculation in one simple gauge, e.g., coulomb gauge
is sucient17 to get this general result and in that case one obtains explicitly the boundary
integrals as follows

17explicit manipulations of the gauge independence of the unconventional term have been established only
for some limited class of gauges [10, 11, 12]. but these results will be generalized to the case of general gauges
due to the gauge invariance of the term.

24

c

from which the anomalous spin q
2 of (48) for the base matter eld, which is dened as the
surface term m 12
for the base matter eld is readily seen to follow for general gauges:
the commutation relation [q, (x)] = (x) which is a basic ingredient in the derivation, is
gauge independent relation because it expresses the gauge independent fact that  carries the
unit charge18. on the other hand, the second term of m 12
c , which vanishes only in the coulomb
gauge19, gives the gauge restoring contribution to the rotation transformation for the matter
eld for the general gauges; actually, this is the case for the rotation non-invariant gauge since
the coulomb gauge only is the rotation invariant  one20. finally, we note that the anomalous
spin, which comes only from m 12
s , has a unique meaning because of the uniqueness of the
improved generators in that they are gauge invariant on the constraints surface and obey the
poincare algebra though this is not the case for the canonical ones.

furthermore, this uniqueness of anomalous spin is in contrast to the anomalous statistics,
which has only articial meaning in this case [22]. this is because we can obtain in any eld
theories any arbitrary statistics by constructing gauge invariant exotic operators of the form
of semeno and its several variations [10]. in this sense the relativistic cs gauge theory does
not respect the spin-statistics relation [21] in agreement with hagens result [10, 22]. here, we
would like to comment that the situation of non-relativistic cs gauge theory is not better than
the relativistic case. this is because even though the anomalous statistics is uniquely dened
by removing the gauge eld (in this case the gauge eld is pure gauge due to point nature of
the sources in non-relativistic quantum eld theory) the anomalous spin has no unique meaning
[10, 11]: the anomalous spin can be removed by redening the angular momentum generator
without distorting the poincare algebra.

b. axial gauge (a1  0)

in this gauge, the residual gauge symmetry is ai  ai = i, 1 = 0 which preserves the
chosen gauge a1  0. under this transformation, the matter eld  is gauge invariant when
the dressing satises the equation

and by comparing to the original equation (7) one obtains furthermore another equation

2
z c2(x  z) = 2(x  z),

(50)

(51)

18this can be explicitly checked by considering the general gauges r d2z k(x, z)a(z)  0 with a kernel

k(x, z) as will be discussed in subsection d in a dierent context.

19the other factor zlal will not be zero for all space region.
20these gauge should be translation invariant also such that the each gauge is dened over all space.

1
z c1(x  z) = 0.

25

now, let us consider the several solutions of the equations (50) and (51). first the simplest
solution is [5]

c1(x  z) = 0,
c2(x  z) = (x1  z1)(x2  z2)

(52)

with the step function (x)

this gives for w a line integral21

(x) = ( 0 (x < 0)

1 (x > 0)

.

w (x) = z x2



dz2 a2(x1, z2).

in this case, op(x) carries the vector potential at the position y, a1(y) =  h
 (x1  y1)(x2 
y2), a2(y) = 0, which is orthogonal to and non-vanishing only along the integration path; this
can be considered as a shrink of the space where the gauge eld lives for the coulomb gauge
into one-dimensional (straight) lineal space. moreover, since this solution (52) corresponds to
a dierent solution hyper-surface to the coulomb gauge and therefore, its related anomalous
terms in (15) have dierent functional form to (48) even though they are gauge invariant on
their own hyper-surfaces:

01(x) = 0,

02(x) =

12(x) =

dy2 j1(x1, y2),

dy2 j0(x1, y2).

here, we have used the formula (18).

furthermore, one nds that the two characteristic functions of (22) and (23) become as

follows

(x  y) = 0,
11(x  y) = x
12(x  y) = 21(x  y) = 2(x  y),
22(x  y) = 0,

1 (x1  y1),

21here, we are considering the line-integral representation of w in the context of gauge xing which is well-
dened over all space, the crossings in the contour of the integral is not considered. hence, in our case, there
is no path-ordering even when we consider the quantum theory contrast to the case of [20].

(53)

26

and thus the basic brackets of (21), which are found to be the dirac bracket in the axial gauge
a1  0, become as follows

1


x
1 (x1  y1),
{a1(x),a1(y)}d(axial) = 
{ (x), (y)}d(axial) = 2(x  y),
{a1(x), (y)}d(axial) =

(54)

however, it is not straightforward to obtain the dirac bracket for the base elds  and ai
themselves . moreover, for more general solution

c1(x  z) = g(x2  z2),
c2(x  z) = (x1  z1)(x2  z2) + f (x1  z1)

(55)

tively, and the gauge invariant variables (54) are not changed except a1(x) = r d2z [z

with the functions f and g which have the dependence only along the 1 and 2 directions, respec-
1 f (x1

11(x  y) = x
12(x  y) = 21(x  y) = 2(x  y).
it is interesting to note that ij(x  y) is the same as (53) if f (x1  y1) is an anti-symmetric
function, i.e., f (x1 y1) = f (y1 x1). moreover, we note that (x y) is not zero in general
and hence the commutation relations of s are not the bosonic ones and we have additional
contribution in the commutation relation involving ai(x) according to (26).

c. weyl gauge (a0  0)

in this case, the residual symmetry is the time-independent gauge transformation a 
a + ii, with the time-independent gauge function . however, because of the form of
dirac dressing as (6) which is spatially non-local but temporally local, the gauge transformation
of the ,a elds (5) is formally the same as that of gauge unxed case and this gives the same
equation for the dressing as (7).

d. clarication of previous confusions

up to now, there have been several confusions about the gauge xing (kernel-) function

k(x, z) in the gauge condition

z d2z k(x, z)a(z) = 0

z d2x ci(y  x)ai(x) = 0,

(56)

(57)

and the dirac dressing function ck(x z) which satises (7) [5, 6, 7]. the main source of these
confusions is the identity [36, 5]

where the function ci(y  x) rapidly decreases in the asymptotic region so that a boundary
integral r d2x i
x [ci(y  x)w (x)] can be neglected. the identity (57) looks similar to (56),
but there is an important dierence. in (56), a denotes the gauge varying eld and hence
(56) restricts the gauge symmetry of a, while ai in (57) is gauge invariant by denition and
hence (57) does not restrict the gauge symmetry; the identity might be involved with some
other symmetries if there are. actually, it is found that a new symmetry has been introduced
implicitly with the introduction of ci(y  x) [5]22

ck(x  z)  c

k(x  z) = ck(x  z) + kjz

(58)
22it is interesting to compare this symmetry to the brst symmetry [31]. these two symmetries seem to be
an extremely dierent ones; since one (brst symmetry) is about gff and the other (ck-symmetry) is about
gif. but they are rather very close in that the fundamental variables (f in the former and (a, , ) in the
latter ) are not gauge transformed: in the former case, the variable f are not gauge transformed by denition;
in the latter case, the variables (a, , ) are not allowed to be gauge transformed because of the introduction
of a complete gauge xing term.

j b(x  z)

28

because the transformed quantity c
k(x  z) also satises the dening equation (7) for the well-
behaved function b(x  z) with   b = 0. however, this transformation is not trivial one
because it makes w transform as follows

w (x)  w (x) +z d2z b(x  z)b(z)

(59)

j hkjb(x  z)ak(z)i for rapidly decreasing function
by neglecting the boundary term r d2z z
b(x  z). hence one nds a strange situation that the gauge invariant variables f  transform
as follows

(x)  (x) = ei(x) (x),
a(x)  a

(x) = a(x)  x

(x),

(60)

which looks like as a gauge transformation with a transformation function (x) = r d2z b(x
z)b(z)   1
 r d2z b(x  z)j0(z). but the existence of the relation (58), (59), (60) saves this
situation. let us consider the transformation of the condition (58), (59), (60):

0 = z d2x ci(y  x)ai(x)  0 = z d2x ci

(y  x)ai(x)

= z d2x ci(y  x)ai(x)  2z d2x b(y  x)b(z)
 

 z d2x b(y  x)j0(x)

2

where we have neglected the boundary terms in the third line for the rapidly decreasing functions
ci(y  x) and b(y  x). then, one can nd that b(y  x) = 0 is the only solution for b(y  x)
which retains the condition (57) when x is located at the source points where j0(x) does
not vanishes.
it is interesting to note that the identity (57) corresponds to the divergence-
free condition   at = 0 for the gauge invariant transverse component at in (9): as the
divergence-free condition denes at , the condition (57) can be also considered as a dening
equation for ai. on the other hand, it is easy to see that only for the coulomb gauge, the
identity (57) is reduced to the divergence-free condition which is consistent to the fact of the
equivalence of ai and ai in this gauge.

there is one more interesting eect of the condition (57). to see this, let us consider the

condition (57) with ai expressed by the solution of (16)

0 = z d2x ci(y  x)ai(x)

= z d2z b(z)z d2x kici(y  x)ck(z  x).

(61)

in general, the function ck(z  x) is sum of the parity even and odd parts. however, if one
restricts only one part, i.e., ci(y x) = ci(x y) for the parity even or odd parts, respectively,

29

(61) becomes

and one nds nally

0 = z d2z b(z)(z  y)
 z d2z j0(z)(z  y)

 

1

(z  y)  0

when z or y is the position of the sources.
[here, the former and latter coordinates z and y,
respectively have no absolute meaning because of the symmetry (24). moreover, in this case
the coordinates in the function b(y  x) are also equal footing because of the symmetry of (58)
which should be preserved by b(y  x) (actually with opposite parity).] this result provides
an simple interpretation of the result (49) for the solution (47) which has odd parity. on the
other hand, the fact of  = 0 in (53) even for the solution (52) which doesnt have the denite
parity is the result of the particular form of (52): for more general solution (55), non-vanishing
 is expected.23

now, nally we note that there is an identity for ak-eld as a dual to (57). to this end, let

us assume that we can write a as

a(x) = a(x)  x

z d2z kk(x  z)ak(x)

with

then, it is easy to show that ak in (62) satises24

zkk(x  z) = 2(x  z).
k

z d2z kk(x  z)ak(z) = 0

(62)

(63)

(64)

when kk(xz) is rapidly decreasing asymptotically such that the boundary termr d2x i
x(ki(y
x)r d2z kk(x z)ak(z)) can be neglected. however, we note that there is no direct connection
between the gauge-xing kernel kk(x  z) and the dressing function ck(x  z) but only the
condition, r d2x i
x (ki(y  x)w (x)) = 0 such that we obtain the gauge condition (64) consis-
tently. [this can be easily obtained by expressing a in the right-hand side of (62) in terms of
a using (5) and comparing the left and right- hand sides.]

23 = 0 is retained under (58) only for the case where b(x  y) = b(y  x), r d2z z
j [b(x  z)cj (y  z) 
b(y  z)cj (x  z)] = 0 are satised; actually these are the condition for the invariance of  and  in general.
24note that ak does not gauge transform by the denition of (62): (64) is just an identity for the completely
gauge xed quantity ak. in this sense (64) is not the gauge xing condition which restricts the gauge variations:
if we consider (64) as a gauge xing, the representation of ki as (63) is possible only for the coulomb gauge as
we have studied in sec. a. (see [32] for comparison)

v. discussion and summary

a. gauge invariance in action

in this paper, we have studied the manifestly gauge invariant hamiltonian formulation
where the energy momentum tensors are gauge invariant. but this does not imply the gauge
invariance of the action25in general: the non-abelian cs gauge theory is an example [34, 35].
hence, if we might nd a representation corresponding to (5) in the non-abelian cs theory, it
will be a problem to get the manifestly gauge invariant action from the original action in terms
of the manifestly gauge invariant elds. however, in our case of abelian theory, there will be
no general obstacle to do this. actually it is found that this is the case: when the gauge eld
a in the cs term of the original action (1) is replaced by the gauge invariant elds a, it
reads

; for the well-localized elds one nds the equivalence of the original cs action of the base
elds to the cs action of gauge invariant eld a. furthermore, since the matter parts can be
made to be manifestly gauge invariant trivially, the total action integral is invariant manifestly.
actually, in this derivation the coecient  does not have any role and actually this fact has
been considered as the signal of the no-quantization of  in a slightly dierent context [34].
according to this interpretation, it is expected that the complete transformation of the original
action into the action which is expressed by the manifestly gauge invariant elds in the non-
abelian cs theory, if it does exist, at least up to the total derivative terms, is not trivial matter
depending on the coecient . if the interpretation is a correct one, we suspect that

[h  i denotes trace] up to the total derivatives term, where  is an integer number which is
involved to the winding number for the homotopically non-trivial, large gauge transformations
of a non-abelian gauge group whose 3 is z: only in this form, it is consistent with the

aaa(cid:29) ,

25gauge invariance of lagrangian (density) is a requirement which is stronger than that of action integral.
appreciation of this subtlety becomes necessary recently, in discussions of the radiatively induced lorentz and
cpt violating cs term in qed [33].

31

well-known quantization of  [35]. but, it is unclear whether the manifestly gauge invariant
variables corresponding to (5) for all gauge transformation, i.e., large as well as small gauge
transformations, exist or not.

b. kinetic mass term and dual connection to maxwell-cs theory

1

in our original theory (1) there is u(1) gauge symmetry and so the kinetic mass term
2 2aa, which breaks the symmetry manifestly, can not be introduced in this context. how-
ever, in contrast, within the gauge invariant elds context, the mass like term

1
2

2aa

(65)

can not be discarded generally [36, 37]. to see what this term implies, let us re-express this
term as follows, using the formulas in the third steps in (16) and (17) which are valid model
independently

aa(x) = z d2zz d2y ck(x  z)cl(x  y)hfk0(z)f l0(y) + fki(z)f li(y)i

= z d2zz d2y c(x  z)c(x  y)f(z)f (y)

(66)

with c0(x  z)  0, without using the equations of motion. the resulted expression is similar
to the maxwells kinetic term, but in a more generalized form, which is absent in the original
theory (1). so, in order to introduce the mass term (65), we must also consider an extension
from the (pure) cs gauge theory (1). on the other hand, since the result (66) was obtained
without using the equation of motion, i.e., model independently, the extended theory need not
have exactly the same form as the nal form of (66): these two theories may be related only
after using the equations of motion or the constraints. the most natural candidate for the
extended theory will be, of course, the maxwell-cs (mcs) theory which has the maxwell term
in addition to the cs theory (1) [35, 34]:

(67)

the theory has the equations of motion, f  + 
2 f = j . for our purpose, let us consider
the special type of dressing (44) and then the gauge invariant elds (5) become [here, we start
from the model independent formulas in (16) and (17)]

duced the convection current, j i  j i  0fi0 whose divergence is generated only from the
cs part:   j =  b ; the covariant form j   j   0f0 is also available from j 0 = j 0.
then, by using (68) and (69), one can express the mass term (66) in terms of f as follows
[we neglect the boundary term in the same ways as (68) and (69)]

the nal form of the right-hand side looks like the maxwell term of (67), but it is still dierent
by the non-local expression through -functions. moreover, because of the explicit appearance
of the function  which is absent in the lagrangian (67), this term has no counter parts in (67).
in order to resolve these problems, let us consider a instead of a:
a0(x) = z d2z x(x  z)(cid:18)b +
j 0(cid:19) (x) +z d2z z
ai(x) = z d2z x(x  z)(cid:18)ijfj0 +

(72)

hence, by combining (71) and (72) together, the mass term (65) corresponds to the maxwell
term in the mcs when we neglect both j  and j -dependent terms and the singular boundary
terms. on the other hand, we note that the neglected j  and j -dependent terms and the
singular boundary terms are order of 1
 with respect to the rst terms in (71) and (72). hence,
it is found that the so-called self-dual action [38, 34] with respect to the gauge invariant elds

corresponds to the mcs theory (or topologically massive gauge theory [35] ) without dynamical
matter parts when we neglect the o( 1

; the result is similar to the previous work [34, 39] in that the sd and mcs theory are equivalent
only when we neglect the dynamical matters26, though equivalent even with the external cur-
rents; but the discrepancy of the order of o( 1
 ), which looks like a pertubative correction in the
path-integral approach of a model [40], is not understood. moreover, we have considered the
special case of (44) in the proof and it is unclear whether the similar equivalence can be proved
in more general cases or not; this special case of (44) which is involved with the coulomb gauge
in gff, might be connected to the results of the phase space path-integral approach of ref. [39],
where the coulomb gauge was crucial for the equivalence of lagrangians, but complete connec-
tion is not known27. finally, we note that our method provides a new framework for nding
the corresponding dual theory compared to the previously known methods [34, 39, 41, 42].

26it is not understood why the two dierent types of currents are involved in sd and mcs sides each other.
27in the conguration space analysis, in contrast, the lorentz gauge is crucial for the equivalence [34, 35]; in

this case, the lorentz gauge in the self-dual frame is nothing but the bianchi identity in the mcs frame.

in summary of this paper, we have considered a new gif consistent with gff. our formal-
ism is new in the following three points. (a) we introduced the assumption that there be no
translation transformation anomaly for gauge invariant variables f. from this assumption,
we obtained several new conditions for the dressing function ck(x, z), which are crucial in our
development. (b) we introduced the master formula (41), which allowed matching to the gauge
xed system. (c) we found the manner how the equation of the dressing function ck(x, z) are
modied after gauge xing. using this formulation, we have obtained a novel gif, which is
consistent with the conventional gff: the former formulation provides exactly the rotational
anomaly of the latter. hence, in our formulation there is no inconsistency, as in the previous
gauge independent formulation of ref. [8]. as a byproduct, we explicitly found that the anoma-
lous spin of the charged matter has a unique meaning. this is due to the uniqueness of the
poincare generators when constructed from the symmetric energy-momentum tensor because
it is the improved generator which are (manifestly) gauge invariant and obey the quantum as
well as classical poincare algebra, but this is not the case for the canonical poincare generators.
moreover, we have constructed the physical states in the algebraic construction and also in the
schrodinger picture. in the latter method, we found that the gauge invariant scalar eld 
of the longitudinal mode of ai is crucial for constructing the physical wavefunctional which is
a genuine eect of (pure) cs theory. the existing confusion about the gauge condition and
dressing function have been claried.

we would like to conclude with two additional comments. first, in our formulation, there
is no gauge non-invariance problem of poincare generators on the physical states. this is
essentially due to absence of additional terms proportional to constraints in the generators of
(12), in contrast to the old formulation of dirac [5]. second, the master formula (41), which
guarantees the classical poincare covariance of our cs gauge theory in all gauges, also works in
all other gauge theories. hence as far as the gauge dependent operator ordering problem does
not occur, the quantum poincare covariance for one gauge guarantees also the covariance for
all other gauges. the gauge independent proof of quantum covariance has been an old issue
in quantum eld theory, and now it is reduced to the solvability of the problem of the gauge
dependent operator ordering.

appendix a. diracs extended poincare generators

in this appendix, we will consider the extension of the generators (12) by including the
constraints terms and we will show that the correct transformation law can be obtained for the
undressed base elds f = (a, , ) as well as the gauge invariant elds f = (a, , ).
this method has been widely used after the formulation by dirac [8, 9, 28] and has been
considered as what having a general validity. but in this appendix we will show that this is
valid only when we neglect the singular boundary terms [36].

to this end, let us consider the extended generators by the rst-class constraints t  0 and
t0  0 [here, we included the constraint t0  0 in order to give the correct transformation to
a0 also] [5, 9]

p 0

s(e) = z d2x h||2 + |di|2 + m2||2 + v0

(73)

and consider the transformation property of the undressed base elds a, , ; the transfor-
mation for the gauge invariant elds are the same as in sec. ii.

firstly, for the time translational generator p 0

s(e), this produces the following transformation

0(x),
1


{a0(x), p 0
{ai(x), p 0
{(x), p 0
{(x), p 0

s(e)}  v0
s(e)}  ij
(x) + iv0(x),
s(e)}  
s(e)}  (x)  iv0(x)

jj(x) + iv0(x),

such that p 0
if the coecients are

s(e) can be made to produce the correct transformation {f(x), p 0

s(e)}  0f(x),

jj  0ai,

note that these solutions are consistent with the classical equation of motion f 0k = 1

 kjj j
which can be reproduced by combining the second and the third equations in (74) and the fact
of  = (d0).

secondly, for the space translation generators p i

s(e), this produces the transformations

{a0(x), p j
{ai(x), p j
{(x), p j
{(x), p j

0(x),
1


j0(x) + ivj(x),

s(e)}  vj
s(e)}  ij
s(e)}  h(j + iaj) + ivji (x),
s(e)}  h(j  iaj)  ivji (x)

such that p j
if the coecients are

s(e) can be made to produce the desired transformation {f(x), p j

s(e)}  jf(x)

vi
0  ia0,
ivj  ij
vj  aj.

1


j0 + jai,

note that these solutions are also consistent with the constraint b = 1

j0.

thirdly, for the space-rotation generator m 12

s(e), this produces the transformations

1


{a0(x), m 12
{ai(x), m 12
{(x), m 12
{(x), m 12

j0(x)  iu(x) +z d2z z

s(e)}  u0(x),
s(e)}  xi
s(e)}  hijxi(j + iaj) + iui (x),
s(e)}  hijxi(j  iaj)  iui (x)

i (cid:16)u(z)2x  z)(cid:17) ,

and because of the singular boundary term for {ai(x), m 12
transformation

s(e)}, it is impossible to get the desired

{f(x), m 12

s(e)} = (x12  x21)f(x) + 12

f(x),

for all base elds f unless we exclude the boundary positions in the eld point x. in the case
when  (or ) has no anomalous transformation, the coecients are found to be

u0  ijxija0, u  ijxiaj

(75)

with the transformations

{a0(x), m 12

s(e)}  jkxjka0(x),

37

{ai(x), m 12
{(x), m 12
{(x), m 12

s(e)}  jkxjkai(x)  ikak(x) +z d2z z
s(e)}  jkxjk(x),
s(e)}  jkxjk(x).

i (cid:16)jkzjak(z)2(x  z)(cid:17) ,

it seems that there is no other solution which is better than (75).
additional boundary term is related to the anomaly for the gauge invariant elds f.

finally, to consider the transformations generated by the lorentz-boost generators m 0i

it is not clear how this

s(e),

it is more convenient to re-express m 0i

s(e) in (73) as

m 0i

s(e) = x0p i

s(e) z d2x hxi(cid:16)||2 + |dj|2 + m2||2(cid:17) + u

i
0 t0 + u

and this produces the transformations

{a0(x), m 0j
{ai(x), m 0j

s(e)}  (x0j  xj0)ai(x)  ija0(x) + i(xja0 + u

similar to the rotation transformation, there is a solution for the coecients

which produce the desired transformations

{f(x), m 0j
for the matter eld f as follows

s(e)} = (x0j  xj0)f(x) + 0j

f(x),

{a0(x), m 0j
{ai(x), m 0j
{(x), m 0j
{(x), m 0j

s(e)}  (x0j  xj0)ai(x)  ija0(x) +z d2z z
s(e)}  (x0j  xj0)(x),
s(e)}  (x0j  xj0)(x).

in conclusion, the diracs idea, which introduces the extended poincare generator as a
correct generator without choosing the gauge condition, can be applied in the cs theory only
when we neglect the singular boundary terms. this will be the rst example of this phenomena
as far as we know.

appendix b

in this appendix, we explain the usual case where w (x) itself can be diagonalized and the

physical states can be constructed without recourse to  eld.

our considering model is the maxwell-cs theory [the action will be described in (67)] and

they produce the gauss law constraint

(cid:16)iei + b : j 0 :(cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

physe = 0

(76)

where ei = f i0. the non-vanishing commutation relations are [ai(x), ej(y)] = ihij2(x  y)
and so, one can consider the representation where ai is diagonalized:



h
i

ei(x) |i 
ai(x) |i  ai(x)(a).

ai(x)

(a),

(77)

then, together with the representation for the matter parts (37), the representation (77) make
the gauss law (76) become a dierential equation

" h

i

i



ai(x)

+ b(x)  h(x)



(x)

+ h(x)



(x)# phys = 0.

(78)

on the other hand, since the rst part becomes

i



ai(x)

from the relation

ai(x)!
i   aj(y)

= z d2y "x
= 

w (x)

1
i





aj(y)

+ x

ai(x)!
i   w (y)



w (y)#

x

x

i   aj(y)
i   w (y)

ai(x)! = x
ai(x)! = x

j 2(x  y) + y

j 2(x  y) = 0,

i ci(y  x) = 2(y  x)

(78) becomes, nally

"

h
i



w (x)

+ b(x)  h(x)



(x)

+ h(x)



(x)# phys = 0.

then, it is easy to see that the solution of (79) is the form of [35]

phys(b, w, , ) = eir d2

x b(x)w (x)(b)( , ),

39

(79)

(80)

when (b) and ( , ) are any functionals of b and ,  respectively. because of the rst
exponential factor, the physical wavefunctional are not gauge invariant and actually the factor
produces the 1  cocyle for the mcs theory. furthermore, we note that  eld commutes with
w and iei, the  part of phys is not determined in any way and only has a redundant
role. finally, we note that this model has a well dened weak coupling limit   0, i.e, the
three-dimensional qed limit and the wavefunctional is found to be

phys(b, w, , ) = (b)( , )

from (80); however, the strong coupling limit   , i.e., pure cs limit is not well-dened.

appendix c. proof of master formula

in this appendix, we present the proof of the master formula (41). there are two class of
the constraints system largely: the rst-class constraint system and the second-class constraint
one. in the former, one choose the gauge conditions to remove the redundancies which makes
the quantum theory is well-dened; in the latter one does not introduce additional (gauge)
conditions since the quantum theory is well-dened (at least formally) without it. these two
systems are closely related but the exact equivalence is generally unclear. so, for the denite-
ness, we will consider these two cases separately.

first, let us consider the former case, i.e., the case when there is a rst-class constraints
systems t  0 and corresponding gauge condition   0: {t, t}  t  0,{t, } 6 0. [here,
it does not matter what the bracket algebra for  itself {, } is.] then, the poisson bracket
matrices   {, } (1  t  0, 2    0) becomes

 =   a b

c d ! ,

where a = {t, t}  0, b = {t, } 6 0, c = {, t} 6 0, and d = {, }

with non-vanishing determinant: det = ad  bc  bc. [here, we are considering only
the discrete indices for convenience. generalization to the continuous indices will be straight-
forward.] then, the inverse of  becomes

1 =

det   d b
a !
bc   d b
0 ! .

c

c

1

1

 

here, the fact of 1
22  0 is crucial in the proof. then, the dirac bracket [9] for the gauge
invariant la, which has a vanishing poisson bracket with respect to the rst-class constraints,

40

i.e., {la, t}  0 is found to be

{la, lb}d  {la, lb}  {la, }1
 {la, lb}  {la, 2}1
 {la, lb},

{, lb}
22 {2, lb}

where we have used the conditions {la, t}  0 and 1
22  0 in the second and third lines,
respectively. this proof can be generalized to the case of several rst-class constraints and
corresponding gauge conditions; even with the (partial) gauge conditions which are involved
only for a part of the rst-class constraints, this proof is applied for the partially gauge invariant
variables which commute only with those parts of the rst-class constraints. this proves the
master formula (41) for the former case.

secondly, let us consider the later case, i.e., the case when there is only one second-class
constraint   0:   {, } 6= 0. then, the dirac bracket for the quantity la, which
commutes with the second-class constraint , i.e., {la, }  0 is found to be

{la, lb}d = {la, lb}  {la, }1

22 {, lb}

 {la, lb},

where we have used the fact of {la, }  0. this proof can be generalized to the case of
several second-class constraints together with the rst-class constraints which do not have the
involved gauge conditions when la commutes with the second-class constraints. this latter
case is rather unusual case compared to the former case [28] and has been studied only recently
in the cs theories with boundary [30].
