(6) corresponding scalar potential describes spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking non-zero gaugino condensate . eective superpotential, however, adequate studying domain walls sqcd. seen follows. first, superpotential (6) respect zn discrete symmetry . this, particular, implies use (6) cannot justied describing domain walls interpolating dierent chirally asymmetric vacua model . thus, superpotential (6) adequate describing given chirally asymmetric vacuum. fact, stands (6), description appropriate vacuum k = 0. related strong cp violation. let us notice cp violation sqcd since cp odd angle always canceled chiral transformations massless gluino elds. let us go back eective lagrangian see property realized there. mentioned above, lowest component chiral supereld gluino bilinear hi. highest component supereld formed composite glueballs: hgg + ig gi. usual, latter elds auxiliary components chiral supereld s, and, therefore, appear on-shell scalar potential model7. thus, eective scalar potential model function gluino bilinear only. let us suppose would like deal vacuum state model nonzero value imaginary phase gluino condensate. vacuum im(hik) = n3 sin 2k n ! 6= 0 . (7) imaginary part gluino bilinear cp odd quantity. non-zero vacuum value quantity signals strong cp violation eective potential. cp odd phase cannot rotated away massless fermions eective lagrangian. thus, scalar potential written terms gluino bilinear only, cannot simultaneously describe n dierent vacua yet preserve strong cp invariance model. must therefore generalize eective superpotential (6) including additional elds resulting eective superpotential respects zn discrete symmetry, also consistent absence strong cp violation. done introducing glueball order parameter elds eective lagrangian. thus, 7these auxiliary elds appear eective lagrangian higher superderivatives present corresponding kahler potential. case f-terms become dynamical elds. however, including elds dynamical degrees freedom accompanied problems positive deniteness corresponding scalar potential (for details see ), and, therefore, assumed kahler potential contain superderivatives. expected case large n limit 7 observable eects cp odd phase gluino condensate compensated also restore discrete zn symmetry. another cp odd quantity, non-zero vacuum value eld g eg. moreover, zn symmetric eective superpotential recently proposed . superpotential involves two chiral superelds x , before, whereas x new supereld whose lowest component related (in rather complicated way) gluon bilinears hggi hgegi . corresponding scalar potential contains gluino bilinear via lowest component chiral supereld, also glueballs via lowest component x supereld. indeed, lowest component x mass-shell related highest component s, i.e., gluonic operators discussed above. likewise, f-component x related lowest component s, i.e., gluino bilinear. explicit relations elds governed unknown kahler potential on-shell formulation model. however, one think x supereld introduces necessary order parameters description restores zn symmetry superpotential (6). eective superpotential x superelds given : wef f = ns"ln n3 ! + 1 x + cnenn x# . (8) 1 n xn coecients cn o(1) large n limit, satisfy following constraints8: pn cn = 0, andpn ncn = 1. additional (compared (6)) terms (8) containing x supereld restore discrete zn symmetry well cp invariance eective action 9. particular, zn transformations read: exp(2il/n), x x 2il/n, l integer. thus, superpotential (8) describes n chirally asymmetric vacua sqcd10. vacua given (s,x ) = (sk,xk), sk = n3 exp(xk), xk = 2ik/n, k = 0, 1, ..., n 1. would like point eective superpotential (8) regarded veneziano-yankielowicz superpotential (6) parameter 3 promoted x dependent chiral supereld 3(x ) : 3(x ) 3 exp x + 1 cnenn x! . (9) n xn 8the coecients cn uniquely determined within eective lagrangian approach, principle xed via instanton calculus. so, reasonable expect sum integer n (8) contain either non-negative non-positive values (albeit cannot seen solely grounds eective lagrangian arguments). without loss generality assume n 0 (8). 9the corresponding eective action zn symmetric long kahler potential depends x x via zn symmetric combinations, x + x , enn x , enn x 10 note corresponding on-shell scalar potential ambiguities related dierent branches logarithmic function canceled well. , on. 8 dynamics x eld denes phase 3(x ) (or, equivalently, phase gaugino condensate) accordance (2), superpotential (8) rewritten following useful form: wef f = ns"ln n3(x ) ! + 1# . following notation prove convenient subsequent discussions. let eective superpotential (8) written x nex . wef f = ns"ln 3f (x) ! + 1# . f (x) given f (x) = x exp following properties: 1 n xn0 cn(cid:18)x n(cid:19)nn , f (xk) = 0 , f (xk) = xk n exp(2ik/n) . note f (x) rewritten polynomial: f (x) = n xn0 dn nn + 1(cid:18)x n(cid:19)nn +1 , (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) sum non-negative integers, coecients dn 1 related cns and, result, satisfy following constraints: xn0 dn = 0 , xn0 particular, d0 = exp(c0/n) = 1 + o(1/n). dicult see superpotential (12) zn discrete symmetry (with transformations exp(2il/n), x x exp(2il/n)), corresponding vacua given nn + 1 (16) dn = 1 . = sk = xk3 , x = xk , k = 0, 1, . . . , n 1 . (17) thus, superpotential (12) used describe large n bps domain walls inter- polating two dierent chirally asymmetric vacua (s, x) = (sk, xk) (s, x) = (sk, xk) k = k + 1. since eective superpotential (12) truncation full eective lagrangian (which unlike (12) contains innite number elds), important understand applicability limits approach. let center domain wall so- lution (which depends z coordinate independent x, coordinates) 9 located point z = z0. then, eective lagrangian approach applicable study domain wall distances |z z0| 1 n , (18) stands width wall vanishing large n limit. key simplication allows us explicitly construct bps domain walls large n sqcd. d. bps domain walls n = 1 theories turn nding bps domain walls large n sqcd, subsection would like review useful details concerning generic properties domain walls n = 1 supersymmetric theories. consider n = 1 supersymmetric theory one chiral supereld x. let us assume corresponding kahler potential contain superderivatives. reason- able assumption eective theory large n limit since higher derivative terms expected suppressed powers 1/n. let w(x) superpotential theory f-atness condition wx = 0 discrete set non-degenerate solutions x = xa, = 1, . . . , n. theory expect presence domain walls separating inequivalent vacua x = xa x = xb, 6= b. let z spatial coordinate transverse wall. asymptotically x(z) xa z , x(z) xb z +. domain walls may may bps saturated. problem nding bps domain walls four dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric theories really two dimensional problem coordinates x, along wall play role discussion. thus, problem eectively reduces nding bps solitons two dimensional massive n = 2 quantum eld theories . corresponding bps equation lowest component x supereld takes following form: zx (z) = eif x, fx denotes f-component x supereld, constant phase (whose precise value given moment). kahler potential contains superderivatives, f x related derivative superpotential via following equation motion: x = wx, g g(x, x ) kahler metric dened kahler potential gf k g = kxx . combining bps equation equation motion f x one nds: gzx = exp(i)wx . let us turn calculation surface energy density domain wall satises relation. general supersymmetric theory one chiral supereld superderivatives kahler potential energy time-independent conguration given eab = 1 2z + dz(cid:16)g|zx|2 + v(cid:17) , (19) v = g1|wx|2 scalar potential theory. note eab rewritten follows: 10 eab = 1 2z + dzg1 |gzx exp(i)wx|2 + (exp(i)(wb wa)) , (20) exp(i) arbitrary constant phase. note eab independent . choice = ba obtain bound eab |wb wa| bps bound. exp(iba) = wb wa |wb wa| . (21) bps solutions (for eab = |wbwa|) satisfy following equation: (22) subject boundary conditions x(z) xa,b z . going back domain walls four dimensions, exact bps equation (22), tension domain wall given gzx = exp(iba)wx tab = 1 82|wa wb| . (23) typically, one know exact form kahler metric g. however, case single supereld x considering one still make certain statements corresponding soliton solutions. thus, let x function new coordinate z satises following equation (24) boundary conditions x(z) xa,b z . suppose able nd corresponding solution x(z). next, consider following change variables: z x = exp(iba)wx z z(z) = g(x(z), x (z)) , (25) x(z) corresponding solution. note express x function z, x(z) satisfy original bps equation (22) corresponding boundary conditions. change variables (25) simply dieomorphism one-to-one long kahler metric g non-singular. throughout paper assume corresponding kahler metric g indeed non-singular. moreover, always work coordinate system parametrized z, drop prime sake simplicity corresponding expressions. (this eectively equivalent case g = 1.) note long kahler metric g non-singular, solution (24) (with appropriate boundary conditions) implies corresponding solution (22) exists. moreover, solution bps saturated. next section see problem nding bps domain walls large n sqcd reduced nding bps solitons called landau-ginzburg model. solitons landau-ginsburg theories studied detail . many models integrable. general conditions existence bps solutions rst formulated , exhaustive studies related issues performed. superpotential landau-ginsburg model (in notations) given n distinct vacua model x = xk = exp(2ik/n), k = 0, . . . , n 1. solitons interpolating vacua xk xk bps saturated .

(28) go further, notice description valid pair adjacent vacua, priori approximations made (28) cannot justied pair vacua |k k| n. let us turn kahler potential describing transitions pair nearest- neighboring vacua. generically, kahler potential function entire tower sqcd composite elds superderivatives. reasonable expect, however, large n limit superderivative terms suppressed extra powers 1/n. thus, assume following form kahler potential k = k(i, , x, x ). here, denote elds generically present theory, appear large n eective superpotential (28) describing nearest-neighboring transitions. notice set elds includes supereld well (in accordance (27) one 12 dened l n ). normalizing elds large n limit scale n (just case x). this, particular, implies corresponding components kahler metric (at most) order 1 large n limit. using kahler potential superpotential (28) one write equations motion bps equations. let us start equations motion rst. simplicity presentation write part system equations motion relevant purposes here. must make sure, however, eventually equations motion satised. since superderivatives k, one write following equations motion leading order 1/n: (gi j gi gxx f j ) + (gix x ) 0 , x 0 , f wx , j + gix f f x + gx j (29) sign denotes equality leading order large n expansion. going argue elds irrelevant description domain walls interpolating adjacent vacua. words, argue domain walls neighboring vacua described supereld x alone. see comes let us recall discrete zn symmetry spontaneously broken theory. thus, domain walls separating adjacent vacua. question dealing whether walls bps saturated not. words, always exist wall conguration would satisfy equations motion. however, conguration might might satisfy corresponding bps equations. let us start equations motion dened (29). given boundary conditions () = 0 x() = 0, also taking account non-singularity kahler metric, one rewrite rst equation (29) follows: gi j j + gix x 0 . (30) making transition one vacuum state neighboring one along solution, relative change elds x order 1/n. therefore looking solutions form = i0 + i, i0 (which, non-vanishing, scale n) denote constants set coordinate dependence elds nearest-neighbor transitions. instance, already mentioned, eld enters equations via l = n(1 /n). likewise, large n behavior x supereld set expression x = n(1 /n), real imaginary parts order 1. given relations coecients kahler metric, also varying amount proportional 1/n, written following form: gi j|solution = cij + gix |solution = ci + n n , , n! , n! , (31) cij ci constants (at most) order 1. substituting relations (30) taking account boundary conditions x supereld well 13 elds, i() = 0, one nds (30) admits solutions trivial one: = 0 provided gix |solution o(/n), is, ci 0. note since domain walls must exists (regardless whether bps saturated not), last condition kahler potential must satised. hand, show moment, condition satised, corresponding walls saturate bps bound. next, solve , equivalently x, one use rest equations (29). let us turn second equation (29). shown o-diagonal components metric gix subleading order solution. thus, leading order f j|solution 0. large n expansion second equation (29) turns relation gi consider trivial solution fi 0. precisely solution would like consider purpose nding bps domain walls. indeed, solution implies set bps equations i, namely, fi automatically satised (recall 0 result rst equation (29)). finally, let us discuss third equation (29). given results rst equation j one nds leading order: gxx f x wx . let us turn corresponding bps equation. accordance discussions presented nontrivial bps equation x, zx (z) = exp(ik+1,k)f x, phase k+1,k dened previous section. next step, one use equation motion (32) derive: (32) (33) gxx zx exp(ik+1,k)wx . below, assume corresponding kahler metric gxx non-singular. then, reviewed previous section, absorb kahler metric redenition z. (more precisely, absorb gxx /2 dimensionless.) fact, large n limit procedure equivalent absorption nite constant redenition variable z, or, equivalently, redenition width domain wall nite number. corresponding bps equation reads: introduced inverse width zx exp(ik+1,k)f (x) , = d1 = n . (34) (35) boundary conditions x(z) given by: x() = xk, x(+) = xk+1. reduce formally system described superpotential thus, system bps equations equations motion particular case amended eld dening condition w n3f (x) (36) = 3f (x) (1 + o(1/n 2)) . addition, values elds (including ) solution vanish leading order 1/n expansion. relations supposed satised particular bps solution dealing with. following subsections discuss solution bps equation (34) present explicit form corresponding bps domain wall. 14 a. simple example solving bps equation (34) general form f (x), subsec- tion, illustrative purposes, consider simple example take values numerical coecients dn follows: d0 = d1 = 1 + 1/n, dn (n > 1) coecients o(1/n). leading order 1/n one nds: f (x) d0(cid:16)x (37) n n + 1(cid:18)x n(cid:19)n +1(cid:17) . note eective superpotential (36) case reduces model discussed previous section. next, let us solve bps equation (34) large n limit f (x) given (37). (in subsection closely follow corresponding discussion .) let x = xky . rewrite (34) terms : nzy exp(i/n)h1 ni . boundary conditions read: (z ) = 1 , (z +) = exp(2i/n) . (38) (39) thus, large n limit arg(y ) changes small amount, namely, 0 2/n. convenient parametrize follows: = (1 /n) exp(i( + )/n) . real. boundary conditions read: (z ) = 0 , (z ) = . (38) becomes system following rst order dierential equations: z =  , z = exp() sin() . (40) (41) (42) (43) taking large n limit keeping leading terms. particular, taken account (1 /n)n exp() n . system dierential equations integrated. note equations explicitly contain z. implies (z) (z) give solution appropriate boundary conditions, (z z0) (z z0) constant z0.
