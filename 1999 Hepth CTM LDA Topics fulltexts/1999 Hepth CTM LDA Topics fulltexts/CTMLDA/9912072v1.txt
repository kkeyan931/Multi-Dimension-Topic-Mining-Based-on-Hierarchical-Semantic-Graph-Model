abstract

we study the perturbative dynamics of noncommutative eld theories on rd, and nd an
intriguing mixing of the uv and the ir. high energies of virtual particles in loops produce

non-analyticity at low momentum. consequently, the low energy eective action is singular

at zero momentum even when the original noncommutative eld theory is massive. some of

the nonplanar diagrams of these theories are divergent, but we interpret these divergences

as ir divergences and deal with them accordingly. we explain how this uv/ir mixing

arises from the underlying noncommutativity. this phenomenon is reminiscent of the

channel duality of the double twist diagram in open string theory.

1. introduction

in this note we follow [1-12] and analyze quantum eld theory on a noncommutative
space. for simplicity we focus on the case of the noncommutative rd and in most of the
note we discuss only scalar eld theories (we will briey mention gauge theories in the last

section). although noncommutative gauge theories appear in string theory [13] (see [14]

and references therein for recent developments), through most of the paper our discussion

will be eld theoretic.

the underlying rd is labeled by d noncommuting coordinates satisfying

[x, x] = i .

(1.1)

here  is real and antisymmetric. by a choice of coordinates  can be brought to the

form

0
1

1
0

. . .



 .

(1.2)

(1.3)

thus a  matrix of rank r describes a spacetime with r
and d  r coordinates that commute with all others.

2 pairs of noncommuting coordinates

the algebra of functions on noncommutative rd can be viewed as an algebra of
ordinary functions on the usual rd with the product deformed to the noncommutative,
associative star product, dened by

(cid:0)1  2(cid:1)(x) = e

i

2  y

z

 1(y)2(z)|y=z=x .

thus, we will study theories whose elds are functions on ordinary rd, with actions of
the usual form s = r ddxl[], except that the elds in l are multiplied using the star

product.

in section 2 we take a rst look at the perturbation theory of noncommutative scalar

eld theories. after deriving the feynman rules, we review the results of filk [1], who

showed that planar diagrams in noncommutative eld theories are essentially the same as

those in the corresponding commutative theory.

section 3 is devoted to a detailed analysis of one loop diagrams and especially to
nonplanar one loop diagrams in 3 in six dimensions and 4 in four dimensions. these

diagrams are uv nite but exhibit interesting ir singularities. in particular, even though

the theory we start with is massive, its correlation functions exhibit singularities at zero

momenta!

1

this nontrivial mixture between uv and ir phenomena is perhaps the most surprising

result of this paper. it is tempting to speculate that such mixing of scales could be relevant

to various hierarchy problems like the problem of the cosmological constant.

in section 4 we point out that the ir singularities of section 3 are quite similar to the

appearance of closed string poles in the double twist diagram in open string theory. it is

surprising that a eld theory exhibits such a stringy phenomenon.

in section 5 we explore higher order feynman diagrams and some of their properties.
we also consider the limit of maximal noncommutativity,   . in this limit the theory
is dominated by planar graphs and appears to be stringy.

in section 6 we explain how the noncommutativity of spacetime leads to the surprising

ir phenomena discussed in earlier sections. section 7 is the beginning of an investigation

into the properties of noncommutative gauge theories.

in an appendix we present the

expression for the feynman integral corresponding to an arbitrary graph in a noncommu-

tative theory, written in terms of schwinger parameters.

2. first look at perturbation theory

2.1. feynman rules

for any noncommutative theory, the quadratic part of the action is the same as in the

commutative theory, since

z ddx   =z ddx
z ddx   =z ddx

(2.1)

(we have dropped total derivatives assuming suitable boundary conditions on ). therefore

propagators take their usual form, as in commutative theories.

the interactions are modied. we consider a polynomial interaction (perhaps with

derivatives)

angn2n,

lxn=3

(2.2)

where the powers of the coupling constant g are introduced for convenience, the coecients

an are arbitrary numbers, and the products of  are star products. in momentum space

2

the interaction vertex of n has an additional phase factor relative to the commutative

theory

v (k1, k2..., kn) = e i

kikj ,

where ki is the momentum owing into the vertex through the ith  and

2pi<j

ki  kj  ki kj .

(2.3)

(2.4)

this is the only modication to the feynman rules.

v is not invariant under arbitrary permutations of ki and so one must keep track of
the order in which lines emanate from vertices in a feynman diagram. (using momentum
conservation, it is easy to see that v (k1,    , kn) is invariant under cyclic permutations of
ki.) one way to keep track of the order of the lines is to view  as an n  n matrix
and to use double line notation in the feynman diagrams. in the noncommutative theory

this is useful even when n = 1. contractions which yield distinct diagrams in double line

notation are associated with dierent contributions from the noncommutative phases.

one may associate a genus with every diagram. specically, the genus of a diagram

is the minimum genus of a surface upon which the diagram may be drawn without any

intersections. in the large n expansion, graphs are organized according to their genus. we

will nd it convenient to use the same organization even for n = 1. in the next subsection

we will study the genus zero, planar diagrams.

2.2. planar graphs

in a planar graph it is always possible to regard momentum as an additional index

owing along the double lines. that is, given an l loop planar graph, the momenta
of all lines in the graph may be written in terms of momenta l1,    , ll+1 that ow
unchanged along an index line (see fig. 1) of the graph. like fundamental u (n ) matrix

indices, the index line momenta along adjacent edges of a given propagator ow in opposite

directions. therefore, the momentum through any propagator (or external line) in the
graph is given by li  lj, where li and lj are the index line momenta that ow along the
adjacent edges of the propagator. since index line momenta are always conserved, this

construction automatically implements momentum conservation at vertices. note that

such a construction is not possible in nonplanar graphs.

for any vertex of the graph, let the momenta entering the vertex through the n
propagators be k1, k2,    , kn, in cyclic order. then k1 = li1  li2 , k2 = li2  li3,    , kn =

3

lin  li1 , in terms of which (pi<j ki  kj) = li1  li2 + li2  li3 +    + lin  li1 . thus the

phase factor at any interaction point may be expressed as the product of n terms, one for

each incoming propagator,

v =

nyj=1

e i

2 (lij lij+1 ).

l1

l2

l2

v2

fig. 1: a planar graph in double line notation. the phase associated with,
say, the middle propagator is l2  l3 from the vertex v1 and -l2  l3 from the
vertex v2, adding to zero.

we see that the phase associated with any internal propagator is equal and opposite

at its two end vertices, and so cancels. we conclude that the phase factor associated with

the planar diagram is

v (p1, p2..., pn) = e i

pipj ,

(2.6)

2pi<j

where the sum is taken over all external momenta (in the original variables) in the correct

cyclic order. this result is originally due to [1] and this derivation follows [10]. we note

that this phase factor is exactly the one found in [14] by computing disk amplitudes in

string theory.

it is important that this phase factor is independent of the details of the internal

structure of the graph. thus, the contribution of a planar graph to the noncommuta-

tive eective action is precisely the contribution of the same graph in the  = 0 theory

multiplied by v (p1, p2, ..., pn). such a  dependent phase factor is present in all interac-
tion terms in the bare lagrangian and in all tree graphs computed either with the bare

lagrangian or with the eective lagrangian computed with planar graphs.

at  = 0, divergent terms in the eective action are products of local elds.

v (p1, p2, ..., pn) modies these to the star product of local elds. divergences (due to

4

planar graphs) in the eective action at  6= 0 may therefore be absorbed into redeni-
tions of bare parameters, if and only if the  = 0 theory is renormalizable.

we stress that this renormalization procedure is not obtained by adding local coun-

terterms. the added counterterms are of the same form as the original terms in the

lagrangian but they are not local.

2.3. nonplanar graphs

nonplanar diagrams have propagators that cross over each other, or over external

lines as in fig 2.

kj

k i

fig. 2: two lines crossing in a nonplanar graph.

if, instead of crossing, the two lines in fig. 2 had met at a (4 point) vertex, the graph
would have had an additional phase factor of e i
2 (kjkikjkikikj +kjki) = eikjki
but would then have been planar (as far as this crossing was concerned). therefore, any

nonplanar graph will have an extra phase

e+ikjki

(2.7)

for each crossing of momenta ki and kj in addition to the phase associated with the ordering
of external momenta. the complete phase for a general graph may be written [1]

v (p1, p2, ..., pn) ei(cid:0) 1

2pi,j

cij kikj(cid:1),

(2.8)

where v is as in (2.6), and cij, the intersection matrix, counts the number of times the
ith (internal or external) line crosses over the jth line. crossings are counted as positive if

ki crosses kj with kj moving to the left.

the matrix cij corresponding to a given graph is not unique, since dierent ways
of drawing the graph will lead to dierent intersections (see fig. 3). however, all of

fig. 3: the overlaps in a nonplanar feynman diagram can be chosen in
several dierent ways.

these yield identical feynman integrands; the ambiguity corresponds to the fact that the

internal momenta ki of the graph are not all independent but are constrained by momentum

conservation at each vertex.

as the  dependence of nonplanar graphs does not factor out of the integral, nonpla-
nar graphs at  6= 0 behave very dierently from their  = 0 counterparts. for instance,
as we will see in section 3, all nonplanar one loop diagrams are nite. the improved

convergence of nonplanar graphs is a result of the damping eects of rapid oscillations of

internal momentum dependent phase factors in the integrand. since each nonplanarity

in a feynman diagram results in a new internal momentum dependent phase factor in

the feynman integrand, one is tempted to guess that every nonplanar graph is conver-

gent. more precisely, one might conjecture that, with the exception of divergent planar

subgraphs, there are no new divergences associated with nonplanar graphs. this would

imply that, after the planar graphs have been renormalized, no further renormalization is

needed.

in fact, it turns out that nonplanar graphs (with no divergent planar subgraphs) are

not all nite in theories with quadratic or higher divergences (including all scalar theo-

ries), as we will see in section 5. this would appear to threaten renormalizability of these

theories, since the nonplanar counterterms that cancelled these divergences would be com-

plicated functions of  and external momenta, and have a very nonlocal and complicated

form in position space. at higher orders such counterterms would generate new divergences

of increasingly complicated form. it seems unlikely that this process would terminate with

a nite number of terms written in terms of star products. however, we will interpret

these divergences as ir rather than uv divergences and will suggest a procedure to deal

with them without introducing counterterms.

3. one loop in scalar eld theory

in this section we explicitly compute several one loop nonplanar graphs in 4 theory in
four dimensions and 3 theory in six dimensions. we nd that one loop nonplanar graphs in

noncommutative eld theories are convergent at generic values of external momenta. this
is a consequence of the rapid oscillations of the phase factor eipk where p is an external
momentum and k is the loop momentum. as this phase factor is zero when p vanishes
(i.e. when either  or pnc, the projection of p onto the noncommutative subspace, vanishes),
the nonplanar graph is singular at small |p|. indeed, the eective cuto for a one
loop graph in momentum space is
where p is some combination of the external

1p2

 p

momenta in the process. therefore turning on  replaces the uv divergence with singular

ir behavior. this eect has interesting dynamical consequences for noncommutative eld

theories, some of which are explored below.

3.1. quadratic eective action in 4 theory in d = 4

3.3. validity of the 1-loop approximation

although nonplanar contributions to (3.12) and (3.15) are subleading in g2, they

in particular, the nonplanar term

since the singular dependence of (2)

of (2) on  at  = 0, the leading singularity in (2)
theory is g2n 1

nonplanar on p p replaces the divergent dependence
nonplanar at nth order in perturbation
(we will study n = 2 in section 5). these higher order

(3.16)

the p dependence can be trusted at low momentum except for nonperturbatively small

values of p.

3.4. stability of the perturbative vacuum: with and without fermions

both (3.12) and (3.15) take the form

(3.17)

10

. the constant h is positive for the 4 theory in d = 4, but negative for the 3 theory in

d = 6, leading to a qualitative dierence between the dynamics of the two examples.

when h is positive, the coecient of |(p)|2 in (3.17) is positive for all p. the nonpla-
nar one loop contribution to (3.17) modies the  propagator at small momenta, inducing

long range interactions (see the next subsection).

when h is negative, the coecient of |(p)|2 in (3.17) is negative for momenta so
small that (p2 + m 2)p  p < o(g2). in order to minimize the eective action, (p) attains
in other words, the perturbative
a vacuum expectation value, at these low momenta.

vacuum is unstable.

since the perturbative vacuum for 3 theory is unstable anyway, the observation of

the previous paragraph may not seem too dramatic. however, a similar eect occurs in a
suitably modied 4 theory in four dimensions. recall that the term hg2
pp in (3.17) results
from the quadratic divergence of the nonplanar diagram of the commutative theory. the

sign of the infrared pole is therefore correlated with the sign of the mass renormalization

(due to nonplanar graphs) of this theory.

now adding suciently many (or suciently strongly) yukawa coupled fermions to the
4 theory changes the sign of the mass renormalization. (recall that a model with a single

complex scalar and a single chiral fermion with yukawa coupling g is supersymmetric, has

no quadratic divergences, and therefore h = 0.) thus, in such a theory the sign of the
p  p leads to an instability and the low energy theory has to be analyzed carefully. we
will return to this problem below.

3.5. poles in the propagator

the propagator derived from (3.17) has two poles. the rst is the continuation to

weak coupling of the zero coupling pole at p2 + m2 = 0, and occurs at

p2 + m2 = o(g2).

(3.18)

it corresponds to the fundamental  quanta. the second is absent at zero coupling and

occurs at

p  p = 

g2h
c + m2 + o(g4),
p2

(3.19)

where pc is the restriction of p to the commutative subspace (pc = 0 if  is of maximal

rank).

11

the second pole (3.19) formally signals the presence of a new particle (we will qualify
this below), whose mass goes to zero as g2 is taken to zero. this is true even though the

theory is massive, with mass m. in fact, m plays no signicant role in the new pole.

the appearance of the second pole in the  propagator might make one wonder if

the nonlocality of the tree level noncommutative action was a consequence of a massless

particle having been integrated out. we do not believe this is the case. integrating out a

massless particle produces a nonlocal lagrangian that is nonanalytic in momenta around

p = 0, while the noncommutative action is completely analytic in momenta at all p. indeed,

the low momentum singularity in the eective action results from integrating out very high

(rather than very low) momenta. the light mode in the propagator is a consequence of

very high energy dynamics!

in euclidean space, in the limit g20, both poles in the propagator occur at imaginary
values of momenta (in the case h > 0). in lorentzian signature, we have to choose 0i = 0.
then p2 + m2 = 0 can be satised with real momenta, but p  p = 0 cannot (except for
the trivial solution pnc = 0). thus the second pole corresponds to a lagrange multiplier,
rather than a propagating particle.

at small nite values of g2, p  p =  g2h

c+m2 can be satised by real momenta in
p2
euclidean space if and only if h is negative. a pole at real values of euclidean momenta

corresponds to a tachyonic instability of the vacuum, in accord with the discussion of the

previous subsection. as discussed there, the sign of h depends on the details of the theory.

the pole in the propagator at small values of p has dramatic consequences. in position

space it leads to long range correlations. normally correlation functions decay exponen-

tially, with the decay constant given by the mass m. in the noncommutative theory, with

 of maximum rank, they decay algebraically for small g, and the small g corrections lead

to exponential decay, but with decay constant of order g. we should stress that all this

is only for positive h. otherwise, the theory is tachyonic and suers from the instability

discussed above.

sef f () =z d4x

z()

(cid:0)()2 + m2()2(cid:1) +

that it is possible to choose the functions z(), m() and g2() in such a way that

a) correlation functions computed with this lagrangian have a limit as .
b) correlation functions computed at nite  dier from their limiting values by terms

of order 1

 for all values of momenta.

property b) is manifestly untrue of the noncommutative scalar theories under consid-

eration. while it is presumably possible to choose z(), m() and g2() in such a way
that the  limit of all correlation functions exists, the various correlation functions (at
various values of momenta) do not converge uniformly to their limiting values. as we have

seen above, the two point function computed using (3.20) at any nite value of  diers
signicantly from its  value for small enough momentum pnc (for p  p2  1). in
particular, as we have noted previously, the limit pnc0 does not commute with the limit
.

we attempt to nd a substitute for (3.20) which correctly captures the leading small
momentum singularity in hi at nite . to this end we introduce a new degree of freedom
into the wilsonian action, that reproduces the important low energy eects arising from
integrating out the modes between  and . the new degree of freedom should give a
contribution to the  two point function that is small for pp2  1 and is approximately
pp for p  p2  1. this is achieved by introducing a new eld  into the modied
wilsonian action

3.7. logarithms

so far the eects we have been discussing arose from what started as quadratic diver-
pp , in the noncommutative
theory, which we interpreted as the  pole in the wilsonian action. logarithmic diver-

gences in the commutative theory. these turned into poles,

1

gences are more common than quadratic divergences. they occur even when the quadratic

divergences are absent as is the case in supersymmetric theories or in gauge theories. they

also occur in the scalar theories which we have been discussing.

the logarithmic uv divergences in the nonplanar graphs of the commutative theory
turn into terms of the form ln p  p, which are nonanalytic around p = 0. rather than a
pole,

pp , we now have a cut, ln p  p, which is also an ir singularity.
unfortunately, we do not fully understand the implications of the logarithmic singu-

1

larity in (3.12). consider the wilsonian eective action at small . the dynamics of 

freezes out at these energies (as  is massive), and so  is eectively classical.  is a free

light quantum eld (its four derivative kinetic term is negligible at low energies). the low

energy wilsonian eective action should correctly reproduce the low energy correlation

functions of . the eective action (3.21) (which is expected to be correct for large )

cannot accurately approximate the small  eective action, because correlation functions

computed using (3.21) at small  correctly reproduce the pole but do not reproduce the

logarithm. the correct small  eective action must contain new dynamics, absent in

(3.21). we see two possibilities for the missing dynamics:

a) the classical eld  can couple to two massless particles, resulting in a cut in its two

point function.

b) the classical eld  can couple to a low energy conformal eld theory, with operators
of dimensions of order g2; the logarithm represents the rst term in the expansion of

(cid:0)p  pm2(cid:1)cg2+...

.

clearly, these logarithms need better understanding. we should point out, however, that

regardless of the details, just like the poles, they demonstrate an ir singularity due to a

uv phenomenon!

3.8. vertex corrections

we end this section with a brief look at the contribution of one loop nonplanar graphs

to vertex corrections. the graphs we will compute are logarithmically divergent in the
commutative theory, and so will depend logarithmically on pi  pj, where pi and pj are

14

external momenta. since we are primarily interested in low momentum singularities, we

will ignore all terms regular in pi at pi = 0. in particular, external momentum dependent

phase factors that factor out of the integral will be ignored.

noncommutative 3 in six dimensions

eight graphs contribute to the one loop vertex correction in 3 theory in six dimen-

sions. two of these are planar, (e.g. the rst graph in fig. 6), and dier in the cyclic

ordering of external lines. the remaining six graphs are nonplanar (e.g. the second graph

in fig. 6), and dier in the choice of the external line that cuts an internal line (3 choices),

as well as the cyclic ordering of external lines, given this choice (2 choices). graphs that

dier only in the cyclic ordering of external lines dier only by an external momentum

dependent phase factor. for small external momenta, these phases are unimportant, so

the one loop vertex correction receives four distinct contributions, each with symmetry

for both 4 and 3 theories, each nonplanar graph has an eective cuto 1/p  p where
p is the combination of external momenta which crosses the loop.

4. a stringy analogue

consider the nonplanar one loop mass correction diagram for 3 theory, shown in

fig. 5. this diagram may be redrawn in double line notation, as in fig. 8. of course, in

the noncommutative eld theory, fig. 8 represents a particle running in the loop and the

double line has no thickness.

consider, however, the 1-loop open string diagram (called the double twist diagram)

that may also be drawn as in fig. 8. in string perturbation theory we integrate over the

moduli of the diagrams. the region of moduli space that corresponds to high energies in

the open string loop describes also the tree level exchange of a closed string state as in fig.

9. it leads to a singularity proportional to

1

pg p

, (g is the closed string metric). uv in

the open string channel corresponds to ir in the closed string channel.

16

fig. 8:
double line notation.

the nonplanar mass correction graph for 3 theory redrawn in

fig. 9: the double twist diagram in the closed string channel.

this matches exactly with the behavior of the eld theory diagram of fig. 8, if we

identify the closed string metric as being proportional to 2
 . in fact this identication
is very natural. in [14], it was emphasized that the analysis of d-branes in the presence of

a b eld involves two metrics that are related to each other. the noncommutative gauge

theory propagating on the brane sees the open string metric. the closed string metric

governs the propagation of closed string states in the bulk. when the open string metric

is the identity (as in our paper), the closed string metric reduces (in the decoupling limit)
to 2
 !

this close analogy between a one loop eect in a rather ordinary looking (though

nonlocal) eld theory and an open string theory is quite surprising, and is not completely

understood. it is an indication of the stringy behavior of noncommutative eld theories.

other hints of the stringy nature of noncommutative theories are the t-duality symme-

try of noncommutative gauge theories on tori, and the dominance of planar graphs in a

perturbative expansion at high momentum. we will elaborate on these in section 7.

5. higher order diagrams

in this section we examine the eects of noncommutativity in higher order nonpla-

nar diagrams. in subsection 5.1 we nd examples of nonplanar diagrams (in scalar eld

17

theories) that diverge, and interpret these as ir divergences. in subsection 5.2 we illus-

trate various other eects of noncommutativity at higher orders in a two loop example.

in subsection 5.3 we present the expression for the feynman integral of an arbitrary non-

commutative diagram in the schwinger parameter representation, and comment on the

structural features of this formula. finally in subsection 5.4, we point out the stringy
nature of maximally noncommutative theories obtained by taking   .

 is not maximal). as   , i(g) diverges for n  [r/2]. this divergence occurs at
small knc, and high qi in the loops of fig. 10. it is a combination of uv and ir divergence.
the presence of an ir divergence in a massive theory is surprising, but is in accord with
the other ir phenomena we have seen earlier.

if we rst integrate over k, the divergence in i(g) appears like a uv divergence in
the integrals over qi. if, however, we rst integrate over qi, the divergence appears like
an ir divergence in the integral over k. we prefer the latter interpretation, and propose
to deal with the divergence in i(g) in a fashion similar to the standard treatment of ir
divergences.

we postpone the integral over k and rst sum over n to shift the location of the pole
in the propagator to be outside the integration region. more specically, summing the

innite series of increasingly divergent graphs of fig. 10 for all n as in fig 12, (and also

including planar one loop mass corrections) yields

this procedure cannot be used in theories with negative h because the dangerous
pole in the propagator is shifted to become tachyonic. then, the proper procedure is to

compute the low energy eective action of the  eld and to nd its minimum. we will

not attempt to perform such a calculation here.

we suggest that uv divergences occur only in planar graphs and all other divergences
can be treated as ir divergences, yielding nite, physically sensible answers. we have not

proved this assertion. it will be very interesting to have an explicit proof of this fact.

5.2. other eects at two loops

in this subsection we examine all two loop graphs that contribute to the self mass of
(for simplicity) 3 theory in six dimensions. this will illustrate further eect of noncom-

mutativity present in higher order graphs.

noncommutative 3 theory in six dimensions has two classes of mass correction graphs
at two loops, corresponding to the two graphs in the ordinary 3 theory shown in fig. 13.

b)

fig. 13: the two loop contributions to the self mass of commutative 3
theory in six dimensions.

diagrams in the rst class reduce to the graph of fig. 13a at  = 0. these diagrams

are members of an innite set of graphs that correct the propagators in the graphs of fig.

5, as in the previous subsection. the analysis of these graphs parallels that given in the
previous section for the 4 theory.

fig. 14: representatives of the three categories of graphs in noncommuta-
tive 3 theory that reduce to the diagram of fig. 13b at  = 0.

the diagrams that reduce to the graph of fig. 13b at  = 0 fall into three categories,

representatives of which are shown in fig. 14. fig. 14a shows the single planar graph.
the corresponding feynman integral does not depend on , and evaluates to 1

8 times the
result for the graph of fig. 13b in the commutative theory. as in the commutative theory,

this graph contains overlapping divergences. these are dealt with in the usual way, by

combining it with the counterterm graphs of fig. 15a and fig. 15b, whose contributions
are also suppressed by a factor 1

8 relative to the commutative theory. thus, as in the
commutative theory, the graphs of figs. 14a, 15a and 15b combine to give a result whose

divergence may be cancelled by counterterms.

fig. 15: one loop mass correction graphs with one loop vertex correction
counterterms.

fig. 14b represents a set of three nonplanar graphs, each of which is nonplanar only

because an external line overlaps with an internal line. two of these graphs contain di-

vergent planar vertex correction subgraphs and should respectively be combined with the

one loop graphs containing counterterms shown in figs. 15c and 15d. once their subdia-

grams have been renormalized, these diagrams, as well as the third diagram in this set, are
nite, eectively cut o by ef f = 1
pp . at large ef f , these graphs are all proportional
to g42
ef f ln(ef f ), providing a logarithmic correction to the leading singularity in (3.15).
the proportionality of these diagrams to 2
ef f ) is a consequence
of the fact that fewer counterterms are added in the noncommutative theory than in the

ef f ln(ef f ) (rather than 2

commutative theory.

the four remaining two loop mass correction graphs, which include the diagram of

fig. 14c, are nonplanar due to the crossing of internal lines. as we will show in the
next subsection, these graphs are nite, eectively cuto by 1/ where  is the largest
eigenvalue of  . in contrast to the nonplanar one loop graphs and the graphs considered
in the previous paragraph, these diagrams are nonsingular at low momenta, since the

eective cuto is independent of external momenta. this is a consequence of the fact that

the noncommutative phase factor responsible for removing the divergence depends only on

internal momenta, which are integrated over.

5.3. general higher order graphs

in the appendix, we express the feynman integral for an arbitrary graph (g) in terms

of an integral over schwinger parameters. up to overall constants, the result (part of which

has been independently reported in [11]) is

1

pg(, a)) 1

epi

(5.6)
here p , s, and a are homogeneous polynomials in {i, }, described in terms of graph
theoretic properties of g in the appendix, the phase v (pi ) is as in (2.6), and a are the
eigenvalues of .

21

four terms in this expression involve the noncommutativity parameter :

1) the rst factor v (pi ) is the overall phase, present for any graph. it depends on the

cyclic order of the external momenta p. this is the sole eect of non-commutativity

for planar graphs.

2) the denominator pg is a homogeneous polynomial in {i, } (independent of external
momenta) of degree l, where l is the number of loops in g. divergences of a graph
are associated with regions of parameter space where pg  0. crossing internal
lines of g give rise to  dependent terms in p , and these reduce the rate at which

p becomes small when the s are scaled to zero. more precisely, the degree of pg
as a function of  is 2h, where h is the genus of g (with external lines removed),

so a graph with supercial degree of divergence  at  = 0 will essentially have a
supercial degree of divergence   2hr for  of rank r. thus, crossing internal lines
(assume for simplicity
regulate the divergences with an eective cuto of order

1


that  has maximal rank and all its entries are of the same order of magnitude), as

for the graph of fig. 14c. in particular, this eective uv cuto depends only on 

and not on the momenta.

(sij /pg) pj

3) the exponential factor exp(pi

 ) acts to reduce divergences when an
external momentum p crosses an internal line. if the momenta associated with some
subgraph gq of g crossed by p are scaled by , then the exponential scales as exp(p
p/). thus the exponential cuts o possible divergences associated with gq, with an
pp , as we have seen for the one loop graphs of section 3. as there,
eective cuto
this cuto depends both on  and on the momenta and becomes large as p  p  0,
resulting in the singular ir behavior we have seen previously.

1

4) the nal exponential factor in (5.6) is a phase in the integrand which depends on the

schwinger parameters. this modies the behavior of nite graphs, but does not seem

to aect the convergence of the graph.

using these expressions, it is possible to demonstrate the convergence (at  6= 0) of the
feynman integral associated with g, if g has no divergent planar subgraphs and (gi)  0,
for all subgraphs gi of g, where  denotes the degree of divergence of a graph.

as we have remarked above, the issue of renormalizability of scalar noncommutative

eld theories is quite subtle. some nonplanar graphs are divergent, but we have suggested

that the divergence should be viewed as an ir divergence and should be handled appro-

priately. therefore, we think it will be quite interesting to prove the renormalizability of

these theories to all orders.

22

5.4. maximal noncommutativity

it is interesting to consider the limit in which we take the noncommutativity parameter

 to innity. in this limit the theory is maximally noncommutative. equivalently, we can

hold  xed and scale all the momenta (and masses) to innity. if the theory had been

an ordinary eld theory, and it had not had any mass parameters, this would have been

the short distance limit.

from (5.6) it may be seen that in this limit the amplitudes (at generic values of

external momenta) are dominated by the planar graphs. for nonplanar graphs in which
internal lines cross, the polynomial pg blows up as   . for nonplanar graphs in which
external lines cross internal lines, the factor sij /pg behaves like a positive power of , so
the exponential tends to zero as    (for generical external momenta). only planar
graphs, which have no  dependence apart from the overall phase, survive the   
limit.

this observation is extremely interesting. the maximally noncommutative theory,
which is obtained in the limit    is given by the planar diagrams only. if  is an
n  n matrix the theory in this limit is independent of n . in particular, it is the same
as the large n theory. we therefore conclude that in the high momentum or maximal

noncommutativity limit, the diagrams become planar and the theory appears to be stringy.

in section 4 we pointed out the close similarity between the singular ir eects in the

nonplanar one loop diagram here and in open string theory. the t-duality of noncom-

mutative yang-mills theories on a torus is yet another indication of the stringy nature of

noncommutative eld theories. finally, in the large  limit the theory becomes a string

theory. we nd it intriguing that these eld theories exhibit so many stringy phenomena.

6. origin of uv/ir mixing

in this section we will give some intuitive explanations for why the noncommutativity

of spacetime leads to the surprising mixture of uv and ir. roughly, very small pulses

instantaneously spread out very far upon interacting. in this manner very high energy

processes have important long distance consequences.

since |k(z1, z2, z)| is a constant independent of z1, z2, z, the star product appears to be
innitely nonlocal. however, the oscillations in the phase of k suppress parts of the

integration region. we now make this statement more precise.

consider for simplicity the case d = 2 with coordinates [x, y] = i. let 1 be a
function which has widths of order x1 and y1 in the x and y directions, and assume
that it varies slowly over its domain of support. then, the integral over x1 in (6.1) is
proportional to

z dx11(x1, y1)eix1(y2y)/.

it is suppressed by phase oscillations if

(6.3)

(6.4)

about y.

x1|y2  y|/  1.

we conclude that (1  2)(x, y) samples 2 in a width y2  

1x

in a similar way we arrive at the estimates

y21x  ,

y12x  ,

x21y  ,

x12y  ,

(6.5)

where ai is the width of a in the i direction and ai is an estimate of the nonlocal width
of the ath function sampled by the star product in the ith direction. this is illustrated for

gaussian wave packets in fig. 16.

for the important special case 1 = 2 = , where  is smooth and of width x, y,

the widths x and y of    are given by

x  max(x,


y

), y  max(y,


y

).

(6.6)

thus if  is nonzero over a very small region of size   ,    is nonzero over a much

larger region of size 

 . this nonlocality has important consequences for the dynamics.

6.2. consequences for dynamics

consider, for example, noncommutative 3 theory (3.13). classically, (x) obeys the

equation

(cid:0)2  m2(cid:1) (x) =

g
2

(  ) (x).

(6.7)

given a solution 0(x) to the free equation of motion, the corresponding solution to (6.7)
is given perturbatively by

(x) = 0(x) 

g

2z ddyg(x  y) (0  0) (y) + ...

(6.8)

where g(x) is the appropriate greens function. at rst order the eective source is
g
2 (  ) (x).

as demonstrated in the previous subsection, if 0(x) is nonzero over a region of size
 ) ( is a typical entry of the

, (0  0) (x) is nonzero over a region of size  = max(, 

matrix ).  is very big when  is very small. thus, classically, pulses of size   
   upon interacting. the extent of the spread is independent of

spread to size  = 

the mass of the particle.

in the quantum theory, even very low energy processes receive contributions from high

energy virtual particles. in a nonplanar graph, a virtual particle of energy   1


(size

25


1

  ) will, upon interacting, spread to size , producing important eects at energy
 . therefore, imposing a uv cuto  on  eectively imposes an ir cuto ir = 1

on ir singularities produced by the nonplanar graph. notice that the ir eects produced

1

by high energies in loops are independent of the mass of the particle. this gives us a

qualitative explanation for the eects observed in section 3.

7. noncommutative yang-mills

it is dicult to repeat the analysis of the previous sections for gauge theories for

several reasons.

a) noncommutative gauge theories have no local gauge invariant operators. the most

integration over all space. approximately local gauge invariant operators may be con-

structed as follows. using the change of variables from the noncommutative gauge

easily constructed gauge invariant operators, (for example r ddxt rbf 2) involve an
elds ba to the commutative gauge elds a [14] we can construct local gauge invariant
tative variables ba. these are manifestly gauge invariant, however they are not local.
they are given by a power series in  and are therefore smeared over a region of
size of order the only scale in the problem, i.e.  (again, we assume for simplicity
that  has maximal rank and all its entries are of the same order of magnitude)1.

operators in terms of a, such as trf 2, and express them in terms of the noncommu-

although such gauge invariant observables exist, it is not clear how to calculate with

them and what their properties are. therefore, it is not clear to what extent the ir

eects we encountered above persist in these theories.

b) noncommutative yang-mills theory has massless elds. thus it is dicult to disen-

tangle the usual ir eects from possible ir singularities induced by the noncommu-

tativity.

c) at low energies, noncommutative gauge theories are strongly coupled in terms of

the elementary quanta ba, and it is not clear what the light degrees of freedom are.

therefore, a low energy eective theory like the one we analyzed in the scalar eld

theory is not easy to construct.

d) some of the eects observed in section 3 (for example, the new pole) resulted from the

existence of quadratic divergences. such divergences are absent in yang-mills theory

1 these gauge invariant operators have been suggested by several people among them d. gross,

s. kachru and e. silverstein.

26

which has at worst logarithmic divergences. the logarithmic divergences do lead to ir

singularities but they are not as pronounced as the poles we observed and discussed

above.

in subsection 7.1 below we present the one loop 1pi eective action for u (n ) non-

commutative yang-mills. in subsection 7.2 we determine the energy dependence of the

dilaton in the string theory dual to noncommutative yang-mills, and compare this with

the prediction from the ads/cft correspondence.

7.1. one loop in noncommutative yang-mills

the lagrangian for noncommutative u (n ) yang-mills theory is given by

l =

4g2z tr(bfbf ),

bf = ba  ba  i(cid:16)ba  ba  ba  ba(cid:17)
ba =   i(cid:16)ba      ba(cid:17) = bd.

(7.1)

(7.2)

(7.3)

where ba = baata (tr(tatb) = ab) and

is covariant under noncommutative gauge transformations

the divergent part of the one loop 1pi eective action of the ordinary u (n ) in the back-

ground eld gauge is given by

1( = 0) =

with initial condition g(0) = g0.

we make two comments:

a) the one loop beta function for noncommutative u (n ) yang mills is given for all

n , including n = 1, by (7.5). note, in particular, that the n = 1 theory is also

asymptotically free. the computations in [4-5] conrm (7.5) for n = 1. we stress

that the beta function for the noncommutative theory can be found without doing any

new calculation by simply using the known value of the beta function of the ordinary

commutative su (n ) theory.

b) the u (1) part of the quadratic eective action has a logarithmic ir singular piece.

this is similar to the the wavefunction renormalization in (3.15). note that, as for

the scalar theory, this one loop logarithm is signicantly corrected by higher order

eects at energies for which it is important.

28

7.2. energy dependence of the dilaton

as we have argued in section 5.4, noncommutative theories are dominated by planar
graphs, and therefore seem stringy as   . specically, by the formulae of section 5.3,
a noncommutative feynman diagram of genus h (ignoring external lines) is suppressed

relative to a planar graph by the factor of

1

n 2h

r

2yi=1

1

(e2i)2h ,

(7.9)

where r is the rank of , whose eigenvalues are {1, 1...,r}. the contribution of genus
h graphs to the u (n ) noncommutative gauge theory is expected to reect the contribution

of genus h worldsheets of the noncommutative qcd string, whose dilaton  must therefore

scale with energy according to

e(e) 

1
n

r

2yi=1

1

e2i

.

(7.10)

this prediction may be tested for the n = 4 noncommutative u (n ) theory. the string
theory dual to n = 4 noncommutative u (n ) is iib theory on the spacetime background
described in [15-17]. fields in this background depend on the radial coordinate u (u = 0 at
the horizon, u =  at the boundary), which is identied with the energy scale in the dual
eld theory, via the uv-ir correspondence. the dilaton dependence in these solutions is

indeed

at large u.

appendix a. feynman integral for a general graph in a noncommutative theory

here we present an expression for the feynman integral corresponding to an arbi-

trary graph in a noncommutative theory, written as an integral over schwinger parameters

corresponding to each internal line. this expression reveals several generic eects of the

non-commutativity, which are discussed in section 5.3. the derivation, which is somewhat

technical, will not be presented here.

we begin with a scalar eld theory with no derivative couplings and consider a graph

g with e edges, v vertices, l loops, and external momenta pi (the generalization to
arbitrary theories is given in the next subsection). we introduce schwinger parameters

i for each internal line of the graph, after which the integrals over momenta may be
evaluated exactly to give

c(gi)(x pi )v (pi )

2dldl/2z dieim2

ii(, , pi ).

(a.1)

here, c(gi) is an overall constant given by the product of the symmetry factor for the graph
with all vertex factors. the factor v (pi), dened in (2.6), is the overall phase, present for
all graphs, which depends on the cyclic ordering of ps. the integrand i is

in the rest of this subsection we explain the various objects in this expression.

polynomial dened by

pg = p (g) = xhr(g)

ev +1 yih c

i


.

(a.3)

here h c is the set of internal lines in the complement of h and r(g) is the set of subgraphs

h of g containing only internal lines such that h contains a maximal tree (a tree touching

all vertices) of g and h has maximal genus (a single index line when drawn in double line
notation)2. we note that p is an even polynomial in , of degree 2h, where h is the genus

of the graph g (ignoring external lines).

2 the condition of maximal genus may also be stated as det(cij(h/t )) = 1, where cij is
the intersection matrix for the single vertex graph h/t obtained by starting with h, removing

external lines, and contracting all lines of t to a single point.

where r is a particular external momentum (all choices give equivalent results), gp=q is a
graph obtained by connecting external lines p and q to form a new internal line and gp,q=r
is a graph obtained by connecting external momenta p and q to the vertex connected to r
(without creating any new intersections). here p  means that p is to be evaluated with
schwinger parameters for any added lines set to zero.

a.1. generalization to arbitrary theories

the result of the previous subsection may be easily generalized to arbitrary theories

which may include particles of non-zero spin or derivative couplings. in terms of the mo-

mentum space feynman integrands, these theories will have additional factors of internal

and external momenta in the numerator coming from propagators or vertex factors. the
resulting expressions for i (the schwinger parameter integrand) may be related to the
expressions obtained above for non-derivative scalar theories by the following trick.

consider an arbitrary graph g in a general theory, and let {lj} be the set of inter-
nal momenta which appear (possibly more than once) in the numerator of the feynman
integral. we dene a new graph g+ as follows. for each l, let a be the vertex which l
leaves. now include two new external momenta, a momentum rl which leaves vertex a
immediately counterclockwise from l and a momentum rl which leaves a immediately
clockwise from l. since these momenta sum to zero, they do not aect overall momentum

conservation, and in fact their only eect is to multiply the integrand with an extra phase

eirl

l.

(a.5)

we may now replace all internal momenta l appearing in the numerator of the feynman
integral with derivatives i(1) rl
acting outside the integral. the resulting integral
over internal momenta is exactly the expression i(g+) for the graph g+ in a non-derivative
scalar theory. thus, if the function of momenta in the numerator of the feynman integral



for g is some polynomial (l, p), we have

ig(, ) = (i(1

0 ) rl



, p) ig+ (, 0)|rl
31

=0,0=.

(a.6)

here, ig+ may be explicitly evaluated using the rules of the previous subsection for non-
derivative scalar theories.
in order that this expression be well dened for  of any
rank, we must evaluate ig+ using an invertible 0 and then set 0 =  at the end.
interestingly, this procedure may be used to give feynman integrals for a general theory

in terms of feynman integrals for a nonderivative scalar theory even in the commutative

case of  = 0.
