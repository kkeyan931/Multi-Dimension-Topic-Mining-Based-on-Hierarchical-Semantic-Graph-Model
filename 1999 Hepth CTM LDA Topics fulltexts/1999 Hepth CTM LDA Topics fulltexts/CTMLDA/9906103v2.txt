1 introduction

in examining non-perturbative aspects of various theories dualities play important
roles. the montonen-olive duality interchanges the electric charge (e) and the magnetic
charge (q = n/e) relating the strong and the weak couplings [1]. seiberg and witten
showed that it holds exactly at the quantum level due to the supersymmetries.
it is
crucial to make the models solvable [2]. this duality can be lifted to a sl(2,z) duality
by taking into account of the gauge coupling and the theta angle [3]. there is a similar
duality in string theories called s-duality which interchanges the strong and the weak
string couplings. it can be also lifted to a sl(2,z) duality [4]. the s-duality is reduced to
the electric-magnetic duality in 4 dimensional theories [5, 6]. it makes d3-branes self-dual
[7, 8].

among these dualities the most fundamental and familiar one is the electric-magnetic
(em) duality. the em duality is a symmetry of free maxwell equations under rotations of
the electric and the magnetic elds in u(1) gauge theories. it is a symmetry between the
equations of motion and the bianchi identities. although the duality rotations in terms
of the electric and the magnetic elds are not invariance of the action they can be realized
as transformations of the gauge elds and become a symmetry of the action [9, 10]. the
em duality can be lifted to a sl(2,r) duality [11, 12].

after discovery of d-branes [13] in string theories much attention is payed on the
born-infeld action. the born-infeld action is one of examples of the em duality invariant
actions. the duality condition is examined as sp(2n,r) invariance for n u(1) gauge elds
coupled with scalars [14]. in manifest lorentz covariant approaches it is shown that there
exist families of lagrangians with the duality invariance [15][16]. however closed forms,
beyond the born-infeld, have not seem to be found so far.2

there is an alternative approach in which the em duality invariance is manifest [17,
18]. in addition to the u(1) gauge eld, its dual gauge eld is introduced. in this approach
duality transformations are rotations of these gauge elds and the invariance are easily
implemented. however the manifest lorentz invariance is sacriced for the manifest
duality. a manifest lorentz covariant version of this approach has been developed for the
maxwell theory[19].

in this paper we rst review the conditions on lagrangians both in the manifest lorentz
and in the duality invariant approaches. they are reduced to a non-linear dierential
equation. it has general solutions characterized by an arbitrary function of one variable,
f (u). thus general forms of lagrangians are found by some algebraic tasks in both
approaches. they have the weak eld limit to the maxwell theory. a constant choice
of f (u) gives the born-infeld theory. we present explicit examples some of which are
one-parameter families of generalized born-infeld actions and others is not born-infeld
type. they do not have simple forms and may not be practical. an advantage of our
formulation is that we can write equivalent lagrangians in alternative forms using with
auxiliary variables. they are much simpler and useful for generalization.

2 [15] gives an example that does not have maxwell weak eld limit.

in next section we give a brief review of the duality conditions and show that they are
reduced to a simple non-linear dierential equation. in section 3 we solve it and establish
a prescription to nd invariant lagrangians. it is applied to nd some explicit examples
in section 4. in section 5 we show forms of general invariant lagrangians with auxiliary
variables. summary and discussions are given in last section.

2 duality invariance and lorentz invariance

the em duality is an invariance under so(2) rotations of u(1) eld strength f and

its dual k dened by3

 k  =

l
f

.

(2.2)

in this paper we consider pure u(1) gauge theories without matter eld for simplicity.
the innitesimal duality transformation is

f = k,

k =  f.

(2.3)

since a set of the eld equation   k  = 0 and the bianchi identity   f  = 0 is
invariant under it the duality condition is the invariance of the dening relation of k in
(2.2). it has been examined in general matter coupling theories [14]. the compatibility
condition of the duality rotations with the denition (2.2) is

f  f + k  k = 0.

(2.4)

although it does not mean the invariance of the action it can be shown that (2.3) indeed
becomes a symmetry transformation of the action when it is interpreted as a transforma-
tion of the u(1) gauge elds [9, 10].

the gaillard-zumino condition (2.4) is expressed as a dierential equation for la-
grangians. in the lorentz covariant formulation lagrangians are assumed as functions of
f f and ff ,

l = l(t, z),

t 

1
4

ff ,

z 

1
4

f  f .

using (2.2) the dual eld strength is

k = lt f + lz  f,  k =  lt  f + lz f

3 our conventions are

 f

f,

f

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.1)

where lt = l

t , etc. and the gaillard-zumino condition (2.4) is expressed as [16]

z  z = 0.
the lagrangians of the maxwell and the born-infeld theories are

t  2t lz lt  z l2

z l2

l(m ) = t,

l(bi) = 1 

1 + 2t  z2

which are solutions of (2.7) respectively.

(2.7)

(2.8)

 a dual gauge eld a(2)

in the above lorentz invariant approach the em duality is not manifest. there is an
alternative approach in which the duality invariance is manifest. in addition to the u(1)
eld a(1)
is introduced. the duality transformation is realized
as so(2) rotation mixing two gauge elds.
in this form the duality can be satised
manifestly while the lorentz invariance is not. the schwarz-sen lagrangian [17] for the
maxwell theory is generalized as [18]



lss =

1
2lbi()e()

i  h,

(2.9)

i = f ()

0j , bi() = 1

where e()
jk and l12 = l21 = 1. h is a function of bi()
and is invariant under so(2) rotations of the two gauge potentials (with respect to the
indices ( = 1, 2)) and spatial 3d rotations (with respect to the indices (i = 1, 2, 3)). it
is a function of t and y dened by

2 ijkf ()

t =

+ (b(2))

),

y =

(2.10)

and plays a role of (non-vanishing part of) the hamiltonian in the canonical formalism.

variation of the action with respect to a()

gives identities

ibi() = 0,

( = 1, 2).

using this redundancy of a()

equations of motion of a()

i

can be reduced to

ijkj(le()

k 

h
bk() ) = 0

(le()

k 

h
bk() ) = 0.

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

they are relations between e()s and b()s and (generalized) maxwell equations follow
from the bianchi identities f () = 0.

the lagrangian (2.9) does not possess manifest lorentz invariance. it is guaranteed

by covariance of the equations of motion (2.13) under lorentz boosts,

e()

i

= ijkwjbk(),
3

bi() = ijkwje()
k .

(2.14)

the condition is expressed as a dierential equation for h(t, y),

h 2

t + 2t ht hy + 2y h 2

y  1 = 0.

(2.15)

it has also been derived from the conservation of energy momentum tensors [18]. h for
the maxwell and the born-infeld theories are

h (m ) = t,

h (bi) = q1 + 2t + 2y  1.

(2.16)

we have obtained two dierential equations, (2.7) in the manifest lorentz invariant
formalism and (2.15) in the manifest duality invariant formalism. they are converted to
each other by a change of variables

and4

y = 

1
2

z2

l(t, z) = h(t, y).

(2.17)

(2.18)

it is noted the physical region of the variable y in (2.10) is positive while the relation
(2.17) requires continuation of y to negative region. it is true for ts in (2.5) and (2.10).

a purpose of this paper is to nd invariant lagrangians by solving (2.7) and/or (2.15).

they are further simplied by introducing new variable x

and

x = t2 + z2 = qt2  2y

l(t, z) =  h(t, y) = k(t, x).

(2.19)

(2.20)

in terms of new function k(t, x) both dierential equations (2.7) and (2.15) become

k2
t  k2

x  1 = 0.

(2.21)

this dierential equation has been obtained using geometrical consideration in [15]. in
terms of the function k(t, x) the maxwell and born-infeld lagrangians are

k(m ) = t,

k(bi) = 1 q(1 + t)2  x2.

(2.22)

4 the signs of l and h are not determined from (2.7) and (2.15). they are chosen by convention.

3 general solutions

a form of general solutions of the dierential equation (2.21) have been discussed in
[16] and a prescription to obtain invariant lagrangians was presented. in this section we
give an alternative form of general solutions.

we solve the dierential equation (2.21) by setting kt =  cosh , kx = sinh  and

tanh  = u,

kt =

,

kx =

.

(3.1)

1

q1  u(t, x)2

u(t, x)

q1  u(t, x)2

here minus sign of kt is chosen for the maxwell limit (see (2.22)). they verify (2.21)
trivially while it requires an integrability condition

ut(t, x) + u(t, x) ux(t, x) = 0.

(3.2)

this is a familiar non-linear equation and general solutions are obtained by solving arbi-
trary implicit function of two variables , u and x tu, for u [20]. let g(u) be an arbitrary
function of u and solve

x  t u = g(u)

(3.3)

for u. the u(t, x) is a solution of (3.2) and k(t, x) is found by integrating (3.1). the
k(t, x) obtained in this procedure solves (2.21) and the corresponding duality invariant
lagrangians are found through (2.20). we can prove (3.2) by taking derivatives of (3.3)
with respect to t and x

ut =

u

t + g(u)

,

ux =

1

t + g(u)

.

(3.4)

the arbitrariness of g(u) is understood by regarding (3.2) as a t-evolution equation. at
time t = 0 the initial data u(0, x)  g1(x) is taken arbitrarily. the u(t, x) at later time
is determined as long as dierentiability is maintained.

for a given g(u) suppose (3.3) is solved for u. in order to integrate (3.1) it is convenient

to make change of the variables

(t, x)  (t, u),

k(t, u)  k(t, x).

using (3.1) and (3.4)

kt(t, u) = 

1  u2,

ku(t, u) =

u (t + g(u))

1  u2

,

(3.5)

(3.6)

whose integrability is guaranteed by (3.3). the rst equation in (3.6) is integrated with
respect to t

k(t, u) =  t 1  u2 + g(u)

5

(3.7)

and g(u) is determined by the second equation in (3.6),

g(u) =

.

u g(u)

1  u2

it may be integrated by changing the integration variable from u to u = 1  u2

g(u) = z du { g(1  u2)} + const.

(3.8)

(3.9)

we can summarize our result as follows. since g(u) is arbitrary we start choosing an

arbitrary function f (u)  g(u). g(u) and k(t, u) are determined in terms of f (u) as

g(u) = z u

0

du f (u) + c1

and

k(t, u) =  t 1  u2  z

1

1u2

du f (1  u2) + c2.

(3.10)

(3.11)

the solution k(t, x) of (2.21) is determined by solving (3.3) for u with g(u) given by
(3.10).

two integration constants in (3.10) and (3.11) are determined if we impose a condition
that the system goes to the maxwell theory in the weak eld limit. since the maxwell
theory is described by k(t, x) in (2.22),

k(m )(t, x) = t,  kt = 1  u = 0,

(3.12)

then (3.3) for the weak eld t = x = 0 must have the solution u = 0. this condition
determines the integration constant c1 in (3.10) and c2 in (3.11) as

g(0) = c1 = 0,

c2 = 0.

(3.13)

4 examples

for a given function f (u) we can in principle nd the corresponding lagrangians,
manifest lorentz invariant l(t, z) in (2.5) and manifest duality invariant lss in (2.9).
however there are two obstructions practically. one is to solve (3.3) algebraically for u.
another is to integrate (3.10) and (3.11) explicitly. there are some limitations on the
arbitrary function f (u) to get closed forms of lagrangians. the situation is same in the
method by gaillard and zumino [16] and they didnt give explicit example beyond the
born-infeld lagrangian. in this section we present some examples whose lagrangians are
found in closed forms.

we can consider two limiting cases. the a  0 limit naturally goes back to the born-

5 lagrangians with an auxiliary variable

in previous section we presented several examples in which their lagrangians are given
in closed forms. as was seen they are not simple enough for practical applications. it
mainly came from the necessity of solving the equation for u, (3.3),

x  t u = g(u).

(5.1)

in this section we propose an alternative formulation in which this equation is treated as
a constraint. we construct a lagrangian that is equivalent, at least classically, to (3.11)
and (3.3),

l(u, t, x) = 

t  u x
1  u2 z u

0

g(r)
(1  r2)

3

2

dr.

(5.2)

here u is regarded as an independent variable and g(u) is the arbitrary function satisfying
g(0) = 0. by taking a variation of the lagrangian with respect to u we obtain (5.1) as an
equation of motion. if it would be solved for u and the solution is used in the lagrangian

5 if the constant term of f (u) in (4.26) is absent it givs a non-born-infeld type model as example 3.

10

(5.2), l(u(t, x), t, x) becomes k(t, x) in (3.11). actually the lagrangian (5.2) is k(t, u) of
(3.7) in which g(u) is replaced as follows,

g(u) = z u

0

dr

r g(r)

1  r2

=

u g(u)

1  u2 z u
u (x  ut)
1  u2 z u

0

dr g(r)(

r

)

1  r2

dr

g(r)
(1  r2)

.

3

2

(5.3)

here g(u) is replaced by (x  ut) only in the rst term of right hand side.

the lagrangian l(u, t, x) in (5.2) is often useful since the equation for u (5.1) is built
in the lagrangian in stead of imposing by hand. in this form it is not always necessary to
solve the equation for u (5.1) explicitly for many purposes. especially in quantum theory
(5.1) may be left as a constraint rather than a strong equality.

in the lagrangian (5.2) g(u) is arbitrary except g(0) = 0.6 we can regard the last

term as arbitrary function m(u) subject to the boundary condition

and the general form of duality invariant lagrangian is written as

m(0) = m(0) = 0

l(u, t, x) = 

t  u x
1  u2

+ m(u).

(5.4)

(5.5)

or equivalently it is expressed, using u = tanh , as
l(, t, x) = t cosh  + x sinh  + m (),

for born-infeld case

m(0) = m(0) = 0.

(5.6)

m(u) =

finally we list forms of the lagrangian (5.2) for the examples in the last section.

with g(u)  0 gives u = x/t and does not have the correct maxwell limit.

in this paper we have shown that the em duality and the lorentz invariant lagrangians
can be constructed from solutions of the simple non-linear dierential equation (3.2). we
have obtained general solutions which are characterized by the function f (u). manifest
lorentz invariant lagrangians and manifest duality invariant lagrangians are given by
(2.20). we have constructed several examples in closed forms explicitly. the lagrangians
in examples 2, 4 and 5 are one-parameter families of generalized born-infeld theories.
they go back to the born-infeld lagrangian for a  0 limit and have subtly dierent
weak eld expansions for nite value of a. the lagrangian in example 3 has dierent
property from others and does not have the limit to the born-infeld theory.

in [16] gaillard and zumino have given a prescription to nd general solutions of the

dierential equation (2.21). it is characterized by one arbitrary function v(s) as

l =

2p
v(s)

+ v(s),

t = p + q, x = p  q,

where s(p, q) is determined by solving

q =

p

(v(s))2 + s

(6.1)

(6.2)

for s. the relation to ours is found by comparing (variation of) lagrangians as follows,

x  tu = g(u)

l

q = p

v(s)2 + s

l

(6.3)

u = u(t, x)

 u = v(s)21

v(s)2+1



s = s(p, q)

this diagram relates the arbitrary functions g(u) and v(s). for the born-infeld theory
it is

g(u) =

u

b  v(s) = s 1

1 + 2 b s

for a given k(t, x) we can make both manifest lorentz invariant formulation with the
lagrangian l(t, x) in (2.5) and manifest duality invariant one with l(ss) in (2.9). it is
interesting to know whether these two lagrangians are describing same system or not.
since (2.18) is simply a relation of functional forms of two lagrangians in our formalism it
is not evident that they are equivalent. the equivalence is discussed in [18] that the latter
is derived from the former. for the maxwell and the born-infeld theories it is explicitly
shown that ks in (2.22) are giving ls in (2.8) and hs in (2.16).

an advantage of our formulation is that it leads to the general form of the lagrangians
in (5.2) ( or (5.5) and (5.6) ) characterized by the arbitrary functions with its boundary
conditions. they contain auxiliary variable u whose equation of motion gives (5.1). it
is equivalent to the lagrangian in which u is solved as a function of t and x. using
with the auxiliary variable lagrangians have relatively simple forms and much easier to
be handled. these forms of lagrangians may be useful in development of general duality
invariant theories.
