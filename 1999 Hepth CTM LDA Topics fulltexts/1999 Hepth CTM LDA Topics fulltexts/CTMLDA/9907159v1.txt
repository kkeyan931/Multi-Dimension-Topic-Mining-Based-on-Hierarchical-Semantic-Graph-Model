abstract

we discuss the functional representation of fermions, and obtain exact
expressions for wave-functionals of the schwinger model. known features of
the model such as bosonization and the vacuum angle arise naturally. con-
trary to expectations, the vacuum wave-functional does not simplify at large
distances, but it may be reconstructed as a large time limit of the schrodinger
functional, which has an expansion in local terms. the functional schrodinger
equation reduces to a set of algebraic equations for the coecients of these
terms. these ideas generalize to a numerical approach to qcd in higher
dimensions.

i. introduction

although the schrodinger representation is a natural context for developing non-
perturbative methods in eld theory, and provides useful analogs of quantum mechanical
techniques and concepts, it has not received the attention it deserves.
in particular, the
existence of the schrodinger equation was not shown until the work of symanzik [1]. how-
ever there has been a growing interest in the subject, as eld theorists attempt to relate
increasingly sophisticated non-perturbative ideas to the more concrete calculations which
may be performed, for example, in lattice gauge theory. the schrodinger representation
also arises naturally in the study of eld theories on space-times with boundaries [2], and
has recently been applied to investigation of the ads/cft correspondence [3].

symanziks work was restricted to perturbation theory, but in principle the schrodinger
equation can be solved non-perturbatively.
it was shown how to reduce the
schrodinger equation for scalar elds to an innite set of coupled algebraic equations. wave-
functionals (wfs) are non-local in general, but in the presence of a mass gap they undergo
a simplication; for slowly-varying elds they have a derivative expansion, the terms of
which are local expressions involving the elds and their derivatives at a single space-time
point. by exploiting analyticity in a complex scale parameter, it was shown in [4] how this

in [4],

1

expansion could be used to reconstruct physics at all length scales. in this paper we extend
these ideas to fermionic elds.

since the physical spectrum of the schwinger model has a mass gap, we calculated
its vacuum wf in the expectation that it would have a local expansion of the form just
described. however, we will nd that the vacuum wf contains non-physical massless modes
which enforce gauge invariance by screening certain large-distance congurations; because of
this, the vacuum wf cannot be expanded in local terms. this failure of the local expansion
property seems to be a general feature of gauge-invariant theories; for example a similar result
was found for yang-mills in [6]. in spite of this, however, we can still obtain the vacuum
wf from a local expansion by re-expressing it as the large-time limit of the schrodinger
wf. the latter has a local expansion for all eld theories, even those containing massless
particles, because its time parameter acts as an inverse mass for all propagating modes. we
will verify this explicitly for the schwinger model.

the schwinger model has received extensive study over the past several decades, largely
because it illustrates many features of qcd, such as connement and chiral symmetry break-
ing, in an understandable way. it also provides a useful model for testing new techniques.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we discuss the schrodinger representation
for fermions coupled to gauge elds. extending the discussion of the fermion representation
given by floreanini and jackiw in [7], we argue that wfs depend on elds which are
constrained by a local chiral-type projection implemented by operators q. we identify all
possible choices of q in arbitrary dimension, arguing that they are parametrized by a single
complex number. we nd a path-integral expression for the vacuum wf of a gauge theory
coupled to fermions.
in section 3 we explicitly obtain the vacuum wf of the schwinger
model in two ways, by solving the path-integral, and by solving the schrodinger equation.
the path-integral solution provides a particularly straightforward derivation of this result.
we discuss various physical issues such as the vacuum angle, bosonization, connement, and
vacuum condensates. in section 4 we obtain the schrodinger functional, verify that it has
an expansion in local terms, and show that its large time limit reproduces the result of the
preceding section. in section 5 we present our conclusions and discuss the signicance of
these results in the context of a proposed numerical approach to higher dimensional qcd.

ii. representing fermion fields

wave-functionals for fermions coupled to a gauge eld may be represented as overlaps
with a eld state. we work in the weyl gauge a0 = 0, so that the arguments of wfs are
elds (grassman-valued for fermions) dened on a surface of constant time, and wfs are
invariant under time-independent gauge transformations of these elds. so for the vacuum
wf, for example, we have

[u, u,a] = hu, u,a|0i,

(1)

where we have suppressed vector, spinor, colour and avour indices. we will nd that u and
u are actually constrained elds, subject to a local chiral-type projection. the eld state
is chosen as follows: it is diagonal in the gauge eld

hu, u,a| a = ahu, u,a|,

2

(2)

and the conjugate electric eld is represented by functional dierentiation

hu, u,a| e = i



ahu, u,a|.

for fermions we use the florenanini-jackiw representation [7]

hhu, u,a|  =
hhu, u,a|  =

1
2
1
2

(u +

(u +


u

u

)hhu, u,a|
)hhu, u,a|.

(3)

(4)

the notation of (4) indicates that u and u are temporarily treated as unconstrained
elds, eg. for the purpose of taking functional derivatives. it is obvious that (4) is reducible,
but it is important to note that its reducibility may be removed by imposing the constraints
qu = uq+ = 0, for some arbitrary projection operators q = 1
2(1  q), q2 = 1. in the
presence of these constraints, the representation (4) corresponds to diagonalizing q+ and
q:

hu, u,a|q+  = 2q+uhu, u,a|
hu, u,a| q = 2uqhu, u,a|,

and representing the other projections by functional dierentiation

 =

hu, u,a|q
hu, u,a| q+ =

1
2
1
2


uhu, u,a|
q+hu, u,a|.

q

u

(5)

(6)

(8)

we will sometimes use (4) for convenience, but this is equivalent to using (5) and (6).
so physical wfs will always depend only on the constrained elds, and in our nal results
the constraints will always be assumed.

we can make the eld dependence of the eld state more explicit by writing1
  q+u) + ia  e],

hu, u,a| = etr(uqu)hhu, u,a| = hq| exp tr[2(uq

(7)

note the relative factor of etr(uqu) between hu, u,a| and hhu, u,a|, which disappears
when the constraints are imposed. hq| is dened by

hq| a = hq|q+

 = hq| q = 0.

similarly, dening |u, u,ai = exp tr[2(u   u) + ia  e]|qi with |qi satisfying

a|qi = q

|qi = q+|qi = 0, we have

1in this section traces are functional, ie. over spatial indices as well as colour and avour, if
present.

(9)

next we wish to dene an inner-product. the denitions (7) and (8) give rise to the

following equations:

2u)q+hhu, u,a|v, v, aii
0 = (  
= q+(  + 2v)hhu, u,a|v, v, aii
= (  + 2v)qhhu, u,a|v, v, aii
2u)hhu, u,a|v, v, aii,
= q(  

(10)

where we have used the canonical commutation relations. the eld operators in (10) may
be represented by either pair of elds, and the equations solved to give

hhu, u,a|v, v,aii = exp tr(uqu  u2qv + v2q+u + vqv)(a  a).

hence

hu, u,a|v, v, ai = exp tr(2vu  2uv)(a  a),

(11)

(12)

which diers slightly from the inner-product given in [7] and elsewhere. to calculate

inner-products of wfs we use the partition of unity

1 = z dadududvdvetr(2vu2uv)|v, v,aihu, u,a|.

(13)

now for many purposes it is convenient to require physical wfs to be gauge invariant,
in general, we could
so we wish to choose q in such a way that this is made possible.
consider q to have some gauge eld dependence. however, any eld dependence, or non-
locality of q will cause the representation to transform non-trivially under time-independent
gauge transformations (this is easily seen from (7) and (8)). the only gauge invariant
representations are when we take q to be a local, eld independent operator.

several authors, inspired by the similarity of q with a choice of dirac sea, have taken q
to be (non-local) projections p onto +ve/-ve energy eigenstates. the resulting wfs are
invariant under time-independent gauge transformations of the elds, but in general they do
not satisfy gauss law [7,8]. however, if we take q to satisfy the conditions above, gauss
law is always automatically satised.

we can obtain further restrictions on the choice of q by requiring that the overlap (1) is
well-dened and non-vanishing; since |u, u,ai is not a physical state this is not guaranteed
to be the case. consider the vacuum. with p dened as above, it satises

p+|0i = p

|0i = 0.

(14)

the conditions (8) and (14) and the representation (4) lead to the following equations:

4







p(cid:16)u +
(cid:16)u +
q+(cid:16)u 
(cid:16)u 

u(cid:17)hhu, u,a|0i = 0
u(cid:17)p+hhu, u,a|0i = 0
u(cid:17)hhu, u,a|0i = 0
u(cid:17)qhhu, u,a|0i = 0.



these have the solution

hhu, u,a|0i = hq|beum u exp tr(cid:16)ia  e(cid:17)|0i,

(15)

(16)

where m = a1c = c1a, and we dene a = {p, q+}, c = [p, q+]. the constant
of integration b corresponds to the determinant of the dirac operator, and solving (15) is
equivalent to performing the fermion integration, since (16) no longer involves fermion eld
operators. we assume that a1 exists; we can always choose q so that this is the case.
we can reproduce this result in a path integral representation. the vacuum is represented
as limt e ht|si, where s is any physical state not orthogonal to the vacuum. this leads,
via the usual correspondence of matrix elements with path integrals, to the expression

[u, u,a] = z daidd exp(cid:26)sb  sf

+trh2(uq  q+u) + uqu + ia 

ai(cid:27).

(17)

here sb and sf are the bosonic and fermionic parts of the euclidean action, and the integral
is evaluated with the following boundary conditions implied by (8):

ai|t=0 = q+|t=0 = q|t=0 = 0.

(18)

the easiest way to impose the boundary conditions is by point splitting the equal time
propagators which arise in (17). we choose for q+ and q to be propagated forward in
time, and q, q+ backwards (the direction of propagation of the gauge eld is arbitrary).
this is eected by adding boundary terms

(

q+) + itr(a  a)

(19)

to the action, where 
(x, t) = (x, t  ), etc. and we let   0. after adding these
terms, we are free to choose any boundary conditions we like, or to integrate freely over the
boundary values; the result is equivalent to evaluating (17) with the boundary conditions
implied by (8).

the fermion integration is now easily done by standard methods; we obtain the path

integral version of (16)

[u, u,a] = z dai det d exp(cid:26)sb + trhua1cu + i(a  a) 

ai(cid:27).

(20)

d is the dirac operator. we can also write down the vacuum functional for free fermions or
fermions in a classical background eld:

5

[u, u] = exp trhua1cui.

(21)

we will now investigate the possible choices for q. the solution we found above depended
on the existence of the operator a1c; for local q if this does not exist, (15) has no non-
singular solution. we can write a1c = (q + p )1p (q + p ), so we need q + p to be
invertible for all momenta. all q satisfying this condition are given in appendix e of [1];
they take the form

where a2 + b2 + c2 = 1, with the additional conditions

q = a0 + ib05 + c5

(1  b2)1(a  ibc) / [1,),

for m > 0, and b2 6= 1 for m = 0.

we can rewrite (22) as

q+ = (a0 + b1)

1
2

(1 + a0 + b1),

q =

1
2

(1  a0  b1)(a0 + b1),

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

a2+b2 and b = biac

where a = a+ibc
a2+b2 ; from (5) and (6) we see that this is equivalent to choosing
q = 1
2 (1 a0 b1). since a2 + b2 = 1, this means that we can set c = 0 in (22) without
loss of generality. thus the possible choices for q are parametrized by the single, arbitrary
complex number z = a  ib (which could in principle be taken to have local variations in
space).

specializing to two dimensions we can take 0 = 1, 1 = 2, 5 = 3, in which case

q =

1

2 (cid:18) 1
z1

z
1 (cid:19) .

in two dimensions, the general form of a physical wf is

yn a guarantee gauge invariance and f a are arbitrary functions.
it is useful to note that in the presence of the constraints on u and u, two dimensional
gamma matrices have only one eective degree of freedom; ie. in (27) we could have written
0 or 1 in place of 5.

using this and (13) we can calculate (dropping a divergent constant)

iii. the schwinger model vacuum

a. path integral solution

in (1+1) dimensions gauge theories are suciently simple to admit analytical treatment,
and provide a great deal of information about the general structure of wfs. consider the
schwinger model, with euclidean action

z d2x(   ( + iea) +

i
4

f f).

(29)

we take gamma matrices to be euclidean, ,  = . for massless fermions in (1+1)
dimensions we can obtain the fermion determinant by integrating the anomaly [9]; with a
u(1) gauge group the result is

det d = exp( 

e2
2

()2),

(30)

where a =  + . p are obtained as equal time limits of the dirac propagator

and

p = lim
t0

d1,

d = eie(+ 5)0.eie(+ 5)

at t = 0 we want a1 = a, which implies that  = r x(a + ). for  we choose the boundary
condition |t=0 = 0, corresponding to the vanishing of the vacuum angle, as we will explain
later. thus we have

p =

here p denotes the principal part. the operator a1c is easily found; (20) becomes

it may be explicitly veried that (35) satises both gauss law and the schrodinger equation.
note that this expression is both uv and ir convergent; apart from a subtraction of zero-
point energy, no renormalization is necessary in this model.

b. the vacuum angle

the wf (35) is strictly gauge-invariant, so it corresponds to the vacuum with vanishing

vacuum angle. however, a non-zero vacuum angle may be obtained by inserting a term

ie

2 z dx f

(37)

into the path-integral expression (17). this term is proportional to the instanton number,
which is not quantized, as a result of the boundary conditions. we have f = 22,
but on the other hand a = r 0

dt2, so that



z d2x f = 2z dxa.

hence

[u, u,a] = [u, u,a]e

ie

 r dxa

(38)

(39)

(41)

(42)

so that under a large gauge transformation r dxa  r dxa + 2n

e , we have   e2in.
this phase is twice what we might expect; because of the relation (38) large gauge transfor-
mations change the instanton number by multiples of two. to change the instanton number
by one unit, we must perform a large gauge transformation of winding-number one half
e . these half-integer transformations were rst discussed in [10], but
should not be thought of as contributing to the vacuum degeneracy [11]. the periodicity of
 is explained by the fact that it is energetically favourable to create an electron-positron
pair when  > 2 [12].

r dxa  r dxa + 

because of the chiral anomaly, there is another representation for the theta vacuum; by

performing a chiral rotation

  ei 5/2,

  ei 5/2,

(40)

in (17) the term (37) is cancelled. this returns us to the original expression, but with q
replaced by q = qei 5

and u, u chirally rotated, ie.
[u, u,a] = [ei 5/2u, uei 5/2,a].

this implies that

h1

| o( , )|2

i = h1| o(ei 5/2 , ei 5/2)|2i,

a fact which is useful for calculating expectation values in the -vacuum.

all of these results are unaected by giving the fermions a non-zero mass, except that
the mass term is also altered by the chiral rotation (40); m  mei 5
. this indicates that
the vacuum angle has a true physical signicance in this case, whereas for massless fermions
it can be altered by a suitable redenition of the elds.

8

c. solution from the schrodinger equation

a solution for the vacuum wf of the schwinger model (on a circle) was given in [13],
where it was found by solving the schrodinger equation. we now wish to show how a similar
calculation can reproduce the result of the last section. dene

(43)
gauss law implies that x e(x)  ej0(x) on physical states, where j0 =  . by fourier
transforming, this in turn gives us

jm (x, y) = (x)m (y)eier x

a.

y

z dx e2(x)  z dxdyj0(x)j0(y) v (x  y) + f 2,

where f = r dx e and

v (x) =

2 z dp

p2 eipx.

thus the hamiltonian acting on physical states can be written as

h = z dxdyj0(x)j0(y) v (x  y)  iz dx lim

yx

y j 5(x, y) + f 2.

(44)

(45)

(46)

note that the fermion interaction is completely determined by gauss law. the f term is
 r dxa into the
represented by

, and may be diagonalized by inserting a factor of e

it gives the vacuum angle. for the moment we will take this to vanish, so that

ie



wfs, ie.
this term may be ignored.

(r dxa)

gauge invariant wfs have the form (27). if the distributions f a are taken to be trans-
lation invariant, then (27) is simultaneously a zero eigenstate of momentum. inspired by
the path integral calculation of the last section we make the ansatz

there are no higher n-point functions in this case, as the eective theory is non-interacting.
we take  symmetric and (0) = 0, so we can write

(x) = z dpc(p)(1  cos(px)),

h = e0.

for a = 0 (52) reduces to

e0 = iz dx lim

and gives us the divergent vacuum energy. for a = 1 we nd

and

2 z dx((x  y1)  (x  x1))2 = z dpp2c(p)2(1  cos(p(x1  y1))).

(57)

+(x1  y1)z dp

(p) f (p)(eipx1  eipy1)

(58)

corresponds in momentum space to the identity (p)(p + q) = 1 + (p)(q)  (q)(p + q)
( is the step function). this implies that

iz dx(x1  x)(x  y1)((x  y1)  (x  x1))
= 2(x1  y1)z dp|p|c(p)(1  cos(p(x1  y1))).

thus (54) reduces to the quadratic equation

e2
p2 + 2|p|c(p)  p2c(p)2 = 0,

and to get a normalizable wf we must take the appropriate root

c(p) = |p|  p2 + m 2

p2

.

(59)

(60)

(61)

this reproduces the result (35). it is straightforward to show that (52) is satised by this
solution for all a > 1; using the identities (57) and (58) the a = n equation may be reduced
to multiple copies of the a = 1 equation.

d. bosonization

the conning nature of the theory is easily seen from (35); since the potential (45) goes
like |x| at large distances, congurations in which a eld source goes o to innity without
an accompanying anti-source, are exponentially damped. infrared slavery and asymptotic
freedom are similarly seen by scaling the momentum in (45); the eect of such scaling is to
make the coupling constant large for small momenta and vice-versa.

bosonization may be understood by transfering the sources to currents instead of elds.

by a gauge transformation, we can always set a = 0. now consider the following object:

[] = z duduer d2xu 5u[u,


2

u, 0].

(62)

inserting the path-integral expression (34) and performing the u, u integrations gives (with
boundary conditions as before)

[] = z dddesbsf +tr( 5).

(63)

11

this is a functional whose argument couples to a local fermion current. using (30) the

fermion integration yields

[] = z desb 1

= z de 1

2r d2x()2
2r d2x( 2)2 1

where  = e  1
and performing the remaining integration, we nd

 2

 and  = j with j0 = 0, j1 = i(t). hence  = i

from this we can easily reproduce the standard correspondence between bosonic and

it follows that    1  on all physical states. this equivalence may be exploited

in a number of ways; for example it immediately allows us to identify the creation and
annihilation operators of the theory

12

a(p) =

1

2 (cid:16)1/2j0(p)/p  1/2j5(p)(cid:17) ,

(71)

where j0(p) and j5(p) are the fourier transforms of j0(x) = (x) (x) and j5(x) =
(x)5 (x) respectively. also, in calculating physical expectation values

h1|o( , )|2i

(72)

the operator o can be represented in terms of equivalent bosonic operators; the resulting
calculations are generally much easier. to illustrate this, consider the chiral condensate

h  i = h| |i
h|i

= h0|ei 5 |0i

h0|0i

,

(73)

where we have used (42). now the bosonic operators corresponding to the chiral densities

(1  5)  are

me

: ei4 :

(74)

(this can be veried in a similar way to the other bosonization formulae). the normal-
ordering is perfomed with respect to the scale m, and  is the euler constant. thus ei 5 
2 : cos(4 + ) : whose vacuum expectation value is easily ascertained
corresponds to m e
from (65). we have

h  i =

me
2

cos ,

(75)

which is the well-known result [14].

iv. the local expansion

a. the schrodinger functional

we will now describe how the result (35) can be reconstructed from a derivative expan-
sion, whose terms are local expressions in the elds. this allows the techniques of [4,5],
which are generalizable to higher dimensions, to be used to provide an alternative solution
of the theory. naively, the presence of a mass gap in the theory should mean that all prop-
agators are exponentially damped at large distances, so that the logarithm of (35) should
reduce for slowly varying elds to a sum of local terms, ie.
integrals over nite powers of
the elds and their derivatives, evaluated at a single spatial point. unfortunately, because
of gauge-invariance (35) contains massless modes not appearing in the physical spectrum,
and this simplication of the vacuum wf does not occur. this may be seen by noting the
existence of screened large-distance congurations.

we will get around this problem by considering instead the schrodinger functional

13

 [u, u, u, u] = hu, u|eh|u, ui.

(76)

the vacuum functional is just the    limit of this object. we can also extract excited
states by inserting a basis of energy eigenstates

 [0, 0, u, u]  xe

e[u, u]ee .

(77)

the parameter  , which corresponds to euclidean time, acts as an inverse mass for all states
of the theoryphysical or otherwise. provided we work with elds that vary slowly on the
scale of  , the logarithm of  has an expansion in positive powers of  , each term of which
is itself a nite sum of local terms. as we will see, the large  behaviour can be reconstructed
from this expansion.

we will begin by nding the free fermion solution. the schrodinger equation is






 = h ,

where

h =

1

2 z ddx(u +


u

)h(u +


u

),

h = i5x.

we also have the initial condition

if we put

then (50) becomes

0 = hq|u, uii = er dx(uqu),

 = er dx(u( )u),

 = 

1
2

(1  )h(1 + ),

with (0) = q. this equation is solved by

and substitution into (82) gives  = h, (0) = q+, with the solution

 = ( + q)(  q)1,

hence we obtain

 = ei 5 xq+.

 = q + 2q5 tanh(i x)q+,

(78)

(79)

(80)

(81)

(82)

(83)

(84)

(85)

which has a derivative expansion for small  , as promised. it is also easy to nd the (non-
local) large-time limit:

lim


(x  y) = q + 2q

q+,

(86)

which coincides with the solution  = a1c that we found before.

now consider the interacting theory. substituting the result (50) into the time-dependent

schrodinger equation (78) gives
 f a(x1, y1, . . . , xa, ya) = e0f a(x1, y1, . . . , xa, ya) + v (x1, y1, . . . , xa, ya)f a(x1, y1, . . . , xa, ya)

(87)

here we have made h regular by subtracting the zero-point energy (53), ie. h  h  e0;
this may be achieved by normal-ordering. in order that we recover the solution (85) in the
free-fermion limit e  0, we use the ansatz (47) with (x  y) = tanh(i x)(x  y). the
a = 0 part of (87) is of course trivial; for a = 1 it becomes

0 = (x1  y1) (x1  y1) + v (x1  y1)(x1  y1)

+iz dx(x1  x)(x  y1)((x  y1)  (x  x1))
i(x1  y1)z dx lim

y(cid:16)(y  x)eg(x,y,x1,y1)(cid:17)  e0(x1  y1).

yx

in obtaining this we used the identity

(x1  y1) = i(1  tanh2(i ))(x1  y1)

= i(x1  y1)  iz dx(x1  x)(x  y1).

now for small x

the ellipses have the same meaning as in (55). hence as before

y(cid:16)(y  x)eg(x,y,x1,y1)(cid:17) = e0 z dpp2c(p,  )2(1  cos(p(x1  y1))).

(92)

on the other hand, we nd that

15

(93)

(94)

(95)

iz dx(x1  x)(x  y1)((x  y1)  (x  x1)) =

thus (88) reduces to

2(x1  y1)r dp coth( p)pc(p,  )(1  cos(p(x1  y1))).

c(p,  ) + 2p coth(p )c(p,  )  p2c 2(p,  ) +

m 2
p2 = 0.

the initial condition (80) is satised if c(p, 0) = 0. for small  we can expand c as

c =

cn n,



xn=1

and substituting into (94) leads to a recursion relation which is easily solved for the coe-
cients cn, which are polynomials in positive powers of p, divided by 1/p2. we note that (94)
reduces to (60) for large  , so that we recover the vacuum functional, as expected.

just as for the vacuum functional, it is easily shown that the solution given by (94)

satises (87) for all a.

b. solution from a local ansatz

the ansatz (47) is very useful in two dimensions, but it is not clear that it generalizes in
any way to higher dimensions. thus we will now describe an ansatz which does generalize.
provided we work with elds that vary slowly on the scale of  , (x) = tanh(ix )(x)
can be expanded in derivatives of the delta function. it follows from (47) that the logarithm
of  has a local expansion (this should also be true in higher dimensions). this allows us
to write log  in the form (27), where we take the f a to be local:



f a(p1, . . . , p2a) =

xn1,...,n2a=0
f a(x1, y1, . . . , xa, ya) = z dp1

2

. . .

bn1pn1

1 . . . bn2apn2a
2a

dp2a
2

(p1 + . . . + p2a)f a(p1, . . . , p2a).

(96)

since we can gauge away the electromagnetic eld, this leads to the following ansatz

a(q)
n  qu(x)5n

x u(x)

 = 1 +z dx
+z dxdy



xn,q=0
xn,m,q=0



a(q)
nm qu(x)5(n

x u(x))u(y)5(m

y u(y)) + . . . ,

(97)

where the coecients aij... are obtained from the bn in the obvious way. this ansatz can be
inserted directly into the schrodinger equation (87), which thus reduces to an innite set of
algebraic equations (a nite set for each order in  ). we have explicitly veried for the rst
few terms the that the local expansion which results from solving the schrodinger equation
in this way is the same as that which is obtained by expanding the small- solution found
in the last section.

16

now the local expansion depended on expanding  in positive powers of  for small
 , but we can reconstruct the large  behaviour from a knowledge of the local expansion
alone. if we evaluate  for scaled elds u(x/) and u(x/) then it can be analytically
continued to the complex -plane with the negative real axis removed. the proof of this is a
straightforward generalization of the arguments of [4,5]. then by using cauchys theorem,
we can relate the value of the functional at  = 1 to the value at large , where the elds
are slowly varying, so that the  -expansion converges for large  . specically, we study the
following integral:

1

2i zc

d
  1

e [u(x/, u(x/)].

(98)

if we take c to be a circle of suciently large radius we can evaluate this integral by
inserting the local expansion of  for any value of  . alternatively, we can collapse the
contour around the point  = 1, and the negative real axis, the latter contribution being
exponentially suppressed for large . thus we have successfully expressed  for large  in
terms of the local expansion. in practise we will wish to truncate the expansion at some
order, in which case the truncation error is minimized by taking  to be large but nite [4].
the ansatz (96) generalizes straightforwardly to higher dimensions, and could form the

starting point for a numerical approach to (3+1) dimensional qcd.

v. discussion

in this paper we have shown how the degeneracy of the floreanini-jackiw representation
for fermions is related to a choice of diagonalization of the fermionic elds. we have used
this to derive formal expressions for gauge-invariant wave-functionals in the schrodinger
representation, and obtained the vacuum wave-functional of the schwinger model, both
from a path-integral expression and as a solution of the schrodinger equation. all known
features of the model arise naturally in this context.

in general, the wave-functionals of a theory with a mass gap should be expandable in
local quantities at large distances. we have seen how the existence of screened large-distance
congurations spoils this feature in the schwinger model. however, we have obtained the
schrodinger wave-functional and shown that it does have an expansion in local quantities.
this may be obtained directly from the schrodinger equation, which reduces to a set of
algebraic equations. an analogous technique can be applied to gauge theories in higher
dimensions, where the schrodinger functional should also have such an expansion. physical
wave-functionals may be reconstructed by considering its behaviour for large values of the
time parameter, which acts as an infrared regulator.

the techniques of this paper generalize in a straightforward way to other two dimensional
theories, for example involving massive fermions or a non-abelian gauge group. various
perturbative and non-perturbative approximation schemes present themselves. and though
the detailed structure of the solutions is specic to two dimensions, the solution via a local
expansion is a technique which should work in a similar way for higher dimensional gauge
theories.

the main steps involved in implementing a numerical approach to higher dimensional
qcd based on solving the schrodinger equation for the local expansion are as follows.

17

first, to obtain the generalization of (44) to non-abelian elds; this is straightforward,
and allows the hamiltonian to be written in terms of gauge-invariant currents. second, to
write down the local ansatz which generalizes (97). the local gauge-invariant terms which
make up the local expansion are easily identied. renormalization may be dealt with by
adding counterterms familiar from perturbation theory. or, we can consider supersymmetric
theories in which they are absent. finally, after nding the action of the hamiltonian on the
terms of the local expansion, the solution of the schrodinger equation proceeds as described
in section 4 above.
