we present a method for a recursive graphical construction of feynman diagrams with their
correct multiplicities in quantum electrodynamics. the method is rst applied to nd all diagrams
contributing to the vacuum energy from which all n-point functions are derived by functional dif-
ferentiation with respect to electron and photon propagators, and to the interaction. basis for our
construction is a functional dierential equation obeyed by the vacuum energy when considered as
a functional of the free propagators and the interaction. our method does not employ external
sources in contrast to traditional approaches.

i. introduction

in quantum eld theory, it is well known [1,2] that the complete knowledge of all vacuum diagrams implies the
knowledge of the entire theory (the vacuum is the world). indeed, it is possible to derive all correlation functions
and scattering amplitudes from the vacuum diagrams. this has been elaborated explicitly for 4 theory [3,4], following
a general theoretical framework laid out some time ago [5,6]. however, this knowledge has not yet been applied for
constructing an ecient algebraic method along these lines for eld theories of fundamental particles. the purpose
of the present paper is to do this for quantum electrodynamics (qed). we show how to derive systematically all
feynman diagrams of the theory together with their correct multiplicities in a two step process: first we nd the
vacuum energy from a sum over all vacuum diagrams by a recursive graphical procedure. this is developed by solving
a functional dierential equation which involves functional derivatives with respect to the free electron and photon
propagators. in a second step, we nd all correlation functions by a diagrammatic application of functional derivatives
upon the vacuum energy. in contrast to conventional procedures [712], no external currents coupled to single elds
are used, such that there is no need for grassmann sources for the electron elds. an additional advantage of our
procedure is that the number of derivatives to be performed for a certain correlation function is half as big as with
external sources.

in section ii we establish the partition function of euclidean qed as a functional with respect to the inverse electron
and photon progators as well as a generalized interaction. by setting up graphical representations for functional
derivatives with respect to these bilocal and trilocal functions, we show in section iii that the partition function
constitutes a generating functional for all correlation functions. this forms the basis for a perturbative expansion of
the vacuum energy in terms of connected vacuum diagrams. in section iv we then derive a recursion relation which
allows to graphically construct the connected vacuum diagrams order by order. from these we obtain in section v
all diagrams for self interactions and scattering processes by cutting electron as well as photon lines or by removing
vertices. along similar lines we apply in section vi our method for scattering processes in the presence of an external
electromagnetic eld.

ii. generating functional without particle sources

we begin by setting up a generating functional for all feynman diagrams of quantum electrodynamics which does

not employ external particle sources coupled linearly to the elds.

a. partition function of qed

our notation for the action of qed in euclidean spacetime with a gauge xing of feynman type is

aqed[ , , a] =z d4x (cid:20) (i

 + m) +

1
2

a(2)a  e 

a(cid:21)

(2.1)

with dirac spinor elds ,  = 
of the vacuum are completely described by the partition function

0

 (,  = 1, . . . , 4) and maxwells vector eld a ( = 0, . . . , 3). the properties

1

zqed =i d dda eaqed[ ,,a],

where the electron elds  and  are grassmannian. let us split the action into the three terms

aqed[ , , a] = a[ , ] + aa[a] + aint[ , , a],

(2.2)

(2.3)

corresponding to the dirac, maxwell, and interaction terms in (2.1). for the upcoming development it will be useful
to consider the free parts of the action as bilocal functionals. the free action of the electrons is

with a kernel

a[ , ] =zz d4xd4x (x) s1

f(x, x) (x),

f(x, x) = (i
s1

 + m)(x  x),

while the free action for the maxwell eld reads

aa[a] =

with a kernel

1

2zz d4xd4x a(x) d1

f (x, x) a(x)

in the following, we shall omit all vector and spinor indices, for brevity.

d1

f(x, x) = 2(x  x) .

b. generalized action

our generating functional will arise from a generalization of the free action

a(0)[ , , a] = a[ , ] + aa[a]

to bilocal functionals of arbitrary kernels s1(x1, x2) and d1(x1, x2) = d1(x2, x1) according to

a[ , ]  a[ , ; s1] =zz d4x1d4x2 (x1) s1(x1, x2) (x2),
2zz d4x1d4x2 a(x1) d1(x1, x2) a(x2).

aa[a]  aa[a; d1] =

1

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

the kernels s1(x1, x2) and d1(x1, x2) are only required to possess a functional inverse s(x1, x2) and d(x1, x2).
similarly, we shall generalize the interaction to

aint[ , , a]  aint[ , , a; v ] = ezzz dx4

1dx4

2dx4

3 v (x1, x2; x3) (x1)(x2)a(x3),

(2.11)

where v (x1, x2; x3) is an arbitrary trilocal function. at the end we shall return to qed by substituting s  sf, d 
df and ev (x1, x2; x3)  e(x1  x2)(x1  x3).

the generalized partition function

z =i d dda ea[ ,,a;s1,d1,v ]

with the action

a[ , , a; s1, d1, v ] = a[ , ; s1] + aa[ , ; d1] + aint[ , , a; v ]

(2.12)

(2.13)

then represents a functional of the bilocal quantities s1(x1, x2), d1(x1, x2), and of the trilocal function v (x1, x2; x3).
all n-point correlation functions of the theory are obtained from expectation values dened by

2

h o1(x1) o2(x2)    i = z 1i d dda o1(x1)o2(x2)    ea[ ,,a;s1,d1,v ],

(2.14)

where the local operators oi(x) are products of eld operators (x), (x), and a(x) at the same spacetime point.
important examples for expectation values of this kind are the photon and the electron propagators of the interacting
theory

(2.15)

(2.16)

(2.17)

(2.18)

g2(x1, x2)  h a(x1) a(x2) i = z 1i d dda a(x1)a(x2) ea[ ,,a;s1,d1,v ],
eg2(x1, x2)  h (x1) (x2) i = z 1i d dda (x1) (x2) ea[ ,,a;s1,d1,v ].

for a perturbative calculation of the partition function z we dene the free vacuum functional

whose action is quadratic in the elds. the path integral is gaussian and yields

z (0) i d dda ea(0)[ ,,a;s1,d1],

z (0) = exp(cid:2)tr ln s1(cid:3) exp(cid:20)

1
2

tr ln d1(cid:21) .

the free correlation functions of arbitrary local electron and photon operators o(x) are dened by the free part of
the expectation values (2.14)

h o1(x1) o2(x2)    i(0) = [z (0)]1i d dda o1(x1)o2(x2)    ea(0)[ ,,a;s1,d1],

and the free-eld propagators are the expectation values

g2(0)
eg2(0)

(x1, x2) = d(x1, x2)  h a(x1) a(x2) i(0)  d(x2, x1),
(x1, x2) = s(x1, x2)  h (x1) (x2) i(0).

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

to avoid a pile up of innite volume factors in a perturbation expansion, it is favourable to go over from z (0) to the
negative vacuum energy w (0) dened by

where the free electron and photon parts are

w (0)  ln z (0) = w (0)

 + w (0)
a ,

and

the negative total vacuum energy

w (0)

 = tr ln s1

w (0)

a = 

1
2

tr ln d1.

w = ln z

is obtained perturbatively by expanding the functional integral (2.12) in powers of the coupling constant e:

w =



xp=0

e2p w (p),

(2.22)

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

where the quantities w (p) with p  1 are free-eld expectation values of the type (2.19):

w (p) =z16p

throughout this paper we shall use from now on the short-hand notation 1 = x1, 2 = x2, . . . and r1 = r d4x1    .

the expectation values in (2.27) are evaluated with the help of wicks rule as a sum of feynman integrals, which are
pictured as connected vacuum diagrams constructed from lines and vertices. a straight line with an arrow represents
an electron propagator

1



2  s12,

whereas a wiggly line stands for a photon propagator

the vertex represents an integral over the interaction potential:

the vacuum energies (2.23) and (2.24) will be represented by single-loop diagrams

and

.

(2.28)

(2.29)

(2.30)

(2.31)

(2.32)

this leaves us with the important problem of nding all connected vacuum diagrams. for this we shall exploit that the
partition function (2.12) is a functional of the bilocal functions s1(x1, x2), d1(x1, x2), and of the trilocal function
v (x1, x2; x3).

iii. perturbation theory

as a preparation for our generation procedure for vacuum diagrams, we set up a graphical representation of
functional derivatives with respect to the kernels s1, d1, the propagators s, d, and the interaction function v .
after this we express the vacuum functional w in terms of a series of functional derivatives of the free partition
function z (0) with respect to the kernels.

a. functional derivatives with respect to s1(x1, x2), d1(x1, x2), and v (x1, x2; x3)

each feynman diagram is composed of integrals over products of the propagators s, d and may thus be considered as
a functional of the kernels s1, d1. in the following we set up the graphical rules for performing functional derivatives
with respect to these functional matrices. with these rules we can generate all 2n-point correlation functions with
n = 1, 2, . . . from vacuum diagrams. to produce also (2n + 1)-point correlation functions with n = 1, 2, . . . such as
the fundamental three-point vertex function from vacuum diagrams, it is useful to introduce additionally a functional
derivative with respect to the interaction function v123.

1. functional derivative with respect to the photon kernel

the kernel d1

[3]:

12 of the photon is symmetric d1

12 = d1

21 , so that the basic functional derivatives are also symmetric

d1
12
d1
34



1
2

{1342 + 1432} .

(3.1)

by the chain rule of dierentiation, this denes the functional derivative with respect to d1 for all functionals of
d1. as an example, we caculate the free photon propagator (2.20) by applying the operator /d1
12 to eq. (2.17).
taking into account eq. (2.22) and eq. (3.1), we nd

4

inserting the explicit form (2.24), we obtain

d12 = 2

w (0)
a
d1
12

.

d12 =



d1
12

tr ln d1,

with the notation (2.29) and (2.32), we can write relation (3.2) graphically as

1



2 = 



d1
12

.



(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

this diagrammatic equation may be viewed as a special case of a general graphical rule derived as follows: let us
apply the functional derivative (3.1) to a photon propagator d12. because of the identity

we nd

d11d1

12 = 12

z1



d12
d1
34

=

1
2

{d13d42 + d14d32} .

(3.5)

(3.6)

diagrammatically, this equation implies that the operation /d1
cutting the line:

34 applied to a photon line (2.29) amounts to





d1
34

(3.7)

note that the indices of the kernel d1

because of the symmetry of d12, the order in which the spacetime arguments appear in the inverse propagators is of no
importance. inserting for w (0)

the second derivative applied to this gives with the rule (3.6) and, once more (3.3),

a the explicit form (2.24), the rst derivative yields via eq. (3.3) just d34 exp{w (0)

(3.10)

the same diagrams are obtained by applying the cutting rule (3.7) twice to the single-loop diagram (2.32).

while derivatives with respect to the kernel d1 amount to cutting photon lines, we show no that derivatives with
respect to the photon propagator d amount to line amputations. the transformation rule between the two operations
follows from relation (3.6):

which is equivalent to

(3.11)

the functional derivative with respect to d12 satises of course the fundamental relation (3.1):

= z34

{1342 + 1432} .

we shall represent the right-hand side graphically by extending the feynman diagrams by the symbol:

if we write the functional derivative with respect to the propagator d12 graphically as

1

(cid:16)

2  12.

we may express eq. (3.13) as



d12





 (cid:17)

(3.15)

(3.16)

thus, dierentiating a photon line with respect to the corresponding propagator amputates this line, leaving only the
symmetrized indices at the end points.

2. functional derivative with respect to the electron kernel

setting up graphical representations for functional derivatives for electrons is dierent from that in the photon case

since the kernel s1 is no longer symmetric. the functional derivative is therefore the usual one

s1
12
s1
34

= 1342,

(3.17)

from which all others are derived via the chain rule of dierentiation. the free electron propagator s12 is found in
analogy to (3.2) by deriving the free electron vacuum functional (2.23) with respect to the inverse electron propagator
s1:

this implies

s12 =

w (0)

s1
21

.

s12 =



s1
21

tr ln s1,

(3.18)

(3.19)

which follows also from eq. (3.17) and the chain rule of dierentiation. the graphical interpretation of the func-
tional derivative /s1
21 is quite analogous to the photon case. in analogy to eq. (3.4), we write expression (3.19)
diagrammatically as

this, in turn, can be understood as being a consequence of the general cutting rule for electron lines:

dierentiating an electron line with respect to the corresponding propagator removes this line, leaving only the indices
at the end points of the remaining lines.

the analytic relations between cutting and amputating lines are now, just as in eqs. (3.11) and (3.12):

with the above graphical representations of the functional derivatives, it will be possible to derive systematically all
vacuum diagrams of the interacting theory order by order in the coupling strength e, and from these all diagrams
with an even number of legs.

3. functional derivative with respect to the interaction

if we want to nd amplitudes involving an odd number of photons such as the three-point function from vacuum
diagrams, the derivatives with respect to the kernels s1, d1 are not enough. here the general trilocal interaction
function v123 of eq. (2.11) is needed. thus, we dene an associated functional derivative with respect to this interaction
to satisfy

by introducing the graphical rule

b. vacuum energy as generating functional

with the above-introduced diagrammatic operations, the vacuum energy w [s1, d1, v ] constitutes a generating
functional for all correlation functions. its evaluation proceeds by expanding the exponential in the partition function
(2.12) in powers of the coupling constant e, leading to the taylor series

iv. graphical recursion relation for connected vacuum diagrams

in this section, we derive a functional dierential equation for the vacuum functional w [s1, d1, v ] whose solution

leads to a graphical recursion relation for all connected vacuum diagrams.

a. functional dierential equation for w = ln z

the functional dierential equation for the vacuum functional w [s1, d1, v ] is derived from the following func-

tional integral identity

i d dda



 1 n 2 ea[ ,,a;s1,d1,v ]o = 0

(4.1)

with the action (2.13). this identity is the functional generalization of the trivial integral identity r +

 dx f (x) = 0
for functions f (x) which vanish at innity. nontrivial consequences of eq. (4.1) are obtained by performing the
functional derivative in the integrand which yields

i d dda (cid:26)12 +z3

2s1

13 3 + ez34

v134 23a4(cid:27) ea[ ,,a;s1,d1,v ] = 0.

(4.2)

substituting the eld product 23 by functional derivatives with respect to the electron kernel s1
can be expressed in terms of the partition function (2.12):

23 , this equation

23

 ez34

v134



s1
23

[h a4iz] = 0.

(4.3)

to bring this functional dierential equation into a more convenient form, we calculate explicitly the term containing
the expectation of the eld a. this is done starting from the integral identity

after dierentiating the action in the exponential, we nd the expectation of the photon eld

i d dda



a1

ea[ ,,a;s1,d1,v ] = 0.

multiplying this with r2 d25, we yield

(4.8)

which will form the basis for deriving the desired recursion relation for the vacuum diagrams. the rst term on the
left-hand side of eq. (4.8) is innite, but in the next section we will show that this cancels against an innity in the
second term.

9

b. recursion relation

equation (4.8) contains functional derivatives with respect to the electron kernel s1 which are equivalent to cutting
lines in the vacuum diagrams. for practical purposes it will be more convenient to work with derivatives with respect
to the propagators s which remove electron lines. the second term on the left-hand side of eq. (4.8) contains the

12 /s1

12 , which we convert into the dierential operator

operation r12 s1

nf =z12

s12



s12

(4.9)

with the help of (3.30). this operator has a simple graphical interpretation. the derivative /s12 removes an electron
line from a feynman diagram, and the factor s12 restores it. this operation is familiar from the number operator in
second quantization. the operator nf counts the number of electron lines in a feynman diagram g:

when applied to the vacuum diagrams w (p) of order p  1, this operator gives

nfw (p) = 2p w (p),

p  1,

nfg = nfg.

(4.10)

(4.11)

since the number of electron lines in a vacuum diagram without external sources in quantum electrodynamics is twice
as big as the number of vertices. the restriction in eq. (4.11) to p  1 is necessary due to a special role of the vacuum
diagram. take, for example, the electron vacuum diagram of the free theory (2.23). by applying the operator nf, we
obtain with (3.18)

nfw (0)

 = z12

s1

12 s21 = z1

11,

(4.12)

which is a divergent trace integral precisely canceling the innite rst term in eq. (4.8).

separating out w (0) in the expansion (2.26) of the vacuum functional, the left-hand side of the functional dierential

equation (4.8) has the expansion

11 + nfw =

z1



xp=1

2p e2p w (p) =



xp=0

2(p + 1) e2(p+1) w (p+1).

(4.13)

on the right hand side of eq. (4.8), we express the rst and second functional derivatives with respect to the kernel
s1 in terms of functional derivatives with respect to the propagator s by using eq. (3.30) and

desired order from the diagrams of the previous orders, as will now be shown.

with the help of the feynman rules (2.28)(2.30), the functional recursion relation (4.15) can be written diagram-

are linear and involve one or two electron line amputations of the previous perturbative order. the fourth operation
is nonlinear and mixes two dierent electron line amputations of lower orders. to demonstrate the working of this
formula, we calculate the connected vacuum diagrams in second and third order. we start with the amputation of
one or two electron lines in rst order (3.41):

(4.19)

from the diagrams (3.41), (4.18), and (4.19), we read o a simple mnemonic rule for the weights of the connected
vacuum diagrams in qed. each weight is equal to the reciprocal number of electron lines, which, by cutting, generate
dierent two-point diagrams. the sign is given by (1)l, where l denotes the number of electron loops. let us also
note that the total weight, which is the sum over all weights of the vacuum diagrams in the order to be considered,
vanishes in qed. these simple weights are a consequence of the fermi statistics and the three-point form of interaction
(2.11). the weights of the vacuum diagrams in other theories, like 4-theory [35], follow more complicated rules.

11

v. scattering between electrons and photons

from the above vacuum diagrams, we obtain all even-point correlation functions by cutting electron or photon lines.
for the generation of the odd-point functions we use the functional derivative (3.34) with respect to the interaction
function v which removes a vertex from a diagram.

as an illustration, we generate the diagrams for the self interactions described by the propagators (2.15) and (2.16)

and the four-point functions

the three-point vertex function

123 = h 1

(5.3)

a. self interactions

substituting the product of the photon elds a1a2 in the functional integral (2.15) by the photonic functional

derivative 2/d1

12 , the photonic two-point function of the interacting theory is given by

applying the associated cutting rule (3.7) to the vacuum diagrams (3.41) and (4.18) leads to the connected diagrams

and discarding disconnected pieces.

the generation of diagrams for scattering processes between electrons and photons (5.2) and higher even-point

functions is now straightforward.

b. scattering processes

the four-point function of photons is obtained by cutting two photon lines in the vacuum diagrams or one photon

line in the photonic two-point function:

where the spacetime indices in all diagrams are arranged as in the rst. each diagram on the right-hand side has
a partner with opposite sign, where the spacetime indices either of the incoming or of the outgoing electrons are
interchanged. just as disconnected diagrams, the tadpole diagrams vanish for physical propagators s = sf, d = df.
in our general vacuum functional, however, we must not discard them, since they contribute to higher functional
derivatives, which would be needed for the calculation of, e.g., the six-point function.

by interchanging spacetime arguments in the kernels of eq. (5.14) apparently, the feynman diagrams (5.14) describe

also scattering of electron and positron (bhabba scattering) and scattering of two positrons.

3. compton scattering

c. three-point vertex function

the three-point vertex function is obtained from the vacuum energy w by performing the derivative with respect

a vertex from the vacuum diagrams in all possible ways and lets the remaining legs open. dropping disconnected

vi. scattering of electrons and photons in the presence of an external

electromagnetic field

to describe the scattering of electrons and photons on external electromagnetic elds, the action a[ , , a] in
eq. (2.13) must be extended by an additional external current j, which is coupled linearly to the electromagnetic
eld a:

then the partition function (2.12) becomes a functional in the physical current j and is given by

aj [ , , a, j] = a[ , , a] + ez1

j1a1.

z[j] =i d dda eaj [ ,,a,j]

(6.1)

(6.2)

with z = z[0]. the external current is usually supplied by some atomic nucleus of charge n e with integer number n .
for this reason, the factor e is removed from the current in eq. (6.1) to be able to collect systematically all feynman

a. recursion relation for the vacuum energy with external source

along similar lines as before, we derive the recursion relation for the vacuum energy in the presence of an external
current, w [j] = ln z[j] which is now also a functional of j (suppressing the other arguments d1, s1, v ). after
that, we derive a recursion relation only producing those vacuum diagrams which contain a coupling to the source. it
turns out that the resulting recursion relation for current diagrams is extremly simple. hence, this recursion relation
is the ideal extension of the former eq. (4.16) which generates only the source-free diagrams.

1. complete recursion relation for all vacuum diagrams

the recursion relation for all vacuum diagrams with and without external source is derived in a similar manner as
that for all source-free vacuum diagrams (4.16). there will be, however, a few signicant dierences in comparison
with the procedure in sec. iv. since the current j couples to the electromagnetic eld a, vacuum diagrams with
external current always contain photon lines. for this reason, we start with the identity

instead of eq. (4.1). performing the functional derivative leads to

i d dda

in analogy to eq. (4.3). the expectation value of the electromagnetic eld a in the presence of an external source j
is found by exploiting the identity

and using the fact that the free vacuum energy w (0)[j] = w (0)[0] = w (0) is independent of the external current, the

where w (1)[0] = w (1) contains the source-free rst-order vacuum diagrams (3.41). an important dierence between
the recursion relation (6.12) and the previous (4.16) is that the vacuum diagrams in a series of the coupling constant e
contain dierent numbers of photon (or electron) lines, thus not satisfying a simple eigenvalue equation like (4.11). in

16

fact, each vacuum diagram, generated by using the right-hand side of the recursion relation (6.12), must be divided by
twice the number of photon lines in the diagram to obtain the correct weight factor. this procedure is a consequence
of the left-hand side of eq. (6.12), which counts the number of photon lines in each diagram separately. by taking
this into consideration, the second-order vacuum diagrams are given by

w (2)[j] = w (2)[0]

source:

when generating these vacuum diagrams in an external eld, the vertices of the photon elds with the external source
must be permuted. for instance, the following second-order vacuum diagrams are equivalent:

(6.16)

in the following we derive a recursion relation which allows us to generate only those vacuum diagrams which contain
a coupling to the source.

2. recursion relation for vacuum diagrams coupled to the external source

since we have the possibility to generate all source-free vacuum diagrams with the help of the recursion relation
(4.16), we are able to set up a recursion relation to generate only the diagrams with source coupling. inserting on the
left-hand side of eq. (6.6) the equation

h a1 ij =

1
e

w [j]

j1

,

multiplying both sides with j1, and performing the integral r1 yields

on the right-hand side we have changed the functional derivatives with respect to the kernel s1 into functional
derivatives with respect to the propagator s using eq. (3.30). inserting the decomposition (6.9) and utilizing the fact
that w (0) from eq. (2.22) is source-free, w (0)/j1 = 0, we nd

to lowest order, the right-hand side yields source diagrams are

where we have used the wiggle to indicate the restriction to the source diagrams of w (1)[j] in eq. (6.13). the full
functional solving eq. (rrj02) consists of the terms

where the source-free contributions w (n)[0] = w (n) of sect. iv represent integration constants undetermined by
eq. (rrj02). introducing a diagram for the functional derivative with respect to the current j,

w (n)[j] = w (n)[0] + w (n)[j]

(6.21)

the recursion relation for the vacuum diagrams with source-coupling eq. (rrj02) is graphically written for n  1 as

(6.23)

the iteration of this recursion relation is very simple since the right-hand side is linear. each diagram calculated with
the right-hand side of this equation must be divided by the number of source-coupling within the diagram since the
operation on the left-hand side counts the number of source-couplings in the diagram. by considering eq. (6.21), one
easily reproduces the higher-order vacuum diagrams given in the eqs. (6.14) and (6.15).

b. scattering of electrons and photons in the presence of an external source

typically, an external electromagnetic eld is produced by a heavy particle such as a nucleus or an ion. quantum
electrodynamical eects like pair creation, bremsstrahlung, and lamb shift are caused by such electromagnetic elds.
the feynman diagrams for the n-point functions associated with these processes are again obtained by cutting electron
or photon lines from the just-derived vacuum diagrams.

1. vacuum polarization induced by external field

the photon propagator in the presence of an external source

is found by cutting a photon line in the vacuum diagrams (6.13)(6.15):

2. lamb-shift and anomalous magnetic moment

the important phenomena of lamb shift and anomalous magnetic moments are obtained from the perturbative

corrections in the electron propagator:

whose diagrams come from cutting an electron line in the vacuum diagrams (6.13)(6.15). to order e4, we have

3. pair creation, pair annihilation and bremsstrahlung

by dierentiating the vacuum energy diagrams (6.13)(6.15) with respect to the interaction function v123, we obtain

the vertex function in the presence of an external eld:

the connected feynman diagrams are to order e3:

vii. summary

we have introduced a graphical recursion relation obeyed by the vacuum diagrams in quantum electrodynamics. its
iterative solution allows us to generate all vacuum diagrams with their correct weights order by order in perturbation
theory by cutting and joining lines. by removing photon and electron lines as well as vertices from these, we obtain
all diagrams of scattering processes with their multiplicities.
