we show that two-dimensional sigma models are equivalent to certain perturbed conformal eld
theories. when the elds in the sigma model take values in a space g/h for a group g and a
maximal subgroup h, the corresponding conformal eld theory is the k   limit of the coset
model (g/h)k, and the perturbation is related to the current of g. this correspondence allows
us for example to nd the free energy for the o(n) (= o(n)/o(n1)) sigma model at non-zero
temperature. it also results in a new approach to the cp n model.

sigma models occur frequently in particle physics and
condensed-matter physics as a natural way of describing
goldstone excitations and their interactions. even in two
dimensions, where such excitations are massive, sigma
model are very useful. two-dimensional sigma models
have been the subject of a huge amount of study be-
cause they can be interesting toy models for gauge theo-
ries, because they often arise in experimentally-realizable
condensed-matter systems, because this is the highest di-
mension in which they are naively renormalizable, and
because of the powerful theoretical methods applicable.
one of the great breakthroughs in two-dimensional
eld theory was the realization that many known models
(and even more previously-unknown theories) could be
written as perturbed conformal eld theories [1]. more
precisely, one starts with the model at its critical point,
which is described by a conformal eld theory. in many
conformal eld theories, all the relevant operators are
known. one can thus dene a massive eld theory by
adding some relevant operator to the action. this de-
nes the theory to all orders in perturbation theory, even
if the action of the conformal eld theory is not known.
not any such model is integrable (most are not) but if it
is, one can apply a variety of techniques to nd for ex-
ample the exact s matrix and the free energy. literally
dozens of innite hierarchies of models have been solved
over the last decade, the most famous single model being
the ising eld theory at t = tc in a magnetic eld [1].

sigma models have stood somewhat apart from this
line of development. some exact s matrices (for exam-
ple, in the o(n) model [2], the principal chiral model
[3]) have been known for quite some time. the energy in
a magnetic eld at zero temperature in these models can
be computed [4,5], but further progress has been slow.
usually one computes nite-temperature properties in an
integrable model using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz,
but often it is not known how to categorize the solu-
tions of the bethe ansatz equations, a necessary step
for the thermodynamics. there are a few cases where
the computation is possible: the o(3) model and its
sausage deformation [6], the o(4) model (equivalent

to the su (2) principal chiral model) [7] and the super-
symmetric cp n models [8].

these cases all bear an intriguing similarity: these re-
sults were possible because these models could be ex-
pressed as limits of certain perturbed conformal eld the-
ories [9,68]. the purpose of this paper is to explain the
general principle behind these results, and to extend it
further. we will make a general conjecture that these
g/h sigma models are equivalent to the k   limit
of a particular perturbation of the coset conformal eld
theory (g/h)k. the utility of this result is threefold.
first of all, it uncovers a nice general structure of g/h
sigma models. moreover, it makes it possible to use the
powerful methods of perturbed conformal eld theory on
sigma models; we conjecture that this correspondence
is true even if the models are not integrable. finally,
a great deal is known about perturbed minimal models
when they are integrable (much more than in sigma mod-
els), and therefore these results can be applied to sigma
models. in particular, this will enable us to nd the free
energy for the o(n) sigma models for any n.

we study two-dimensional sigma models where the
elds take on values in the symmetric space g/h, where
g and h are lie groups, and h a maximal subgroup of
g. the action is

s =z d2z gij(x)x i(z, z)x j(z, z)

(1)

where z and z are coordinates for two-dimensional space-
time, while the x i and gij(x) are respectively the coor-
dinates and metric of the manifold g/h. if the metric
gij is ricci at (the manifold has vanishing rst chern
class), then the model is conformally invariant and has no
scale. we will discuss manifolds with non-vanishing cur-
vature, where (1) denes an asymptotically-free massive
eld theory. a well-known example is g = h  h, with
h a simple lie group diagonally embedded in hh. the
resulting sigma model is called a principal chiral model.
another example we will discuss is the so-called o(n)
model, where g = o(n) and h = o(n1). this mani-
fold is an n1 dimensional sphere: o(n) is the rotational

1

symmetry of the sphere, while o(n1) is the subgroup
which leaves a given point xed.

a coset conformal eld theory utilizes the ane lie
algebra (often called a kac-moody algebra) gk. this is
a current algebra with operator product

j a(z)j b(w) =

k

(z  w)2 +

f abcj c (w)

z  w

+ . . .

(2)

where the f abc are the structure constants of the ordi-
nary lie algebra for g and k is called the level; k is a posi-
tive integer for a compact lie group. the conformal eld
theory with gk symmetry is called the wess-zumino-
witten model, and is equivalent to the principal chiral
model for g at a particular coupling plus an extra piece
called the wess-zumino term [10]. the central charge
(coecient of the conformal anomaly) of the gk wzw
model is k dimg/(k + h), where f acdf bcd = hab/2.
for g = su (n), h = n, while for g = so(n), h = n
2 (for n  4). the primary elds of the wzw model
correspond to representations of gk. they have scaling
dimensions xj = 2cj/(k + h), where cj is the quadratic
casimir dened by t at a = cji, with the t a the gen-
erators of the lie algebra of g in the jth representation
and i the identity matrix. all the other scaling elds
arise from the operator product of the j a(z) with the
primary elds; it follows from (2) that j has dimension
1 and all elds have dimensions xj plus an integer.

the energy-momentum tensor for a coset conformal
eld theory (g/h)k is constructed from the generators
of gk not in a subalgebra h [11]. the central charge of
this new conformal eld theory is cg  ch . the elds
of the (g/h)k theory are constructed by decomposing a
eld g in gk into representations of the h subalgebra.
because the energy-momentum tensor obeys the orthog-
onal decomposition tg = th + tg/h, the decomposition
of g must be of the form

g = aa

g/h  a
h .

(3)

the coecients a
g/h of this decomposition are the elds
of the coset model (g/h)k. a consequence of g/h be-
ing a symmetric space is that the generators of g not in
h form a real irreducible representation of h [12]. thus
when the components of the current j a(z) are decom-
posed into representations of h, the resulting elds in
the coset model form a real irreducible representation of
h, which we denote as j a, for a = 1 . . . , (dim gdim h).
obviously, the g/h sigma model cannot be equivalent
to a coset theory (g/h)k, because the latter is massless
while the former is not. a massive eld theory is dened
by perturbing (g/h)k by a relevant operator. we can
now state our conjecture precisely.

conjecture the sigma model for the symmetric space
g/h is equivalent to the k   limit of the (g/h)k
coset conformal eld theory perturbed by the operator

o 

dim gdim hxa=1

j a(z)j a(z).

(4)

because the j a form a real irreducible representation of
h, their dimension is independent of a.

in the ultraviolet limit, the perturbation of (g/h)k
goes away, and its central charge when k   is
dimgdimh. in the ultraviolet limit of the sigma model,
asymptotic freedom means that the manifold g/h be-
comes at (e.g. in the o(n)/o(n1) model, the radius
of the sphere goes to innity). the action (1) reduces
to dimgdimh free bosons, which also have the cen-
tral charge dimgdimh. thus the conjecture passes a
simple check. moreover, when one decomposes j a into
representations of h for a in g but not h, the resulting
eld a
h has dimension going to zero as k  . thus the
eld j a has dimension 1 in this limit, so the perturba-
tion o is of dimension 2 and so is naively marginal. it is
not exactly marginal  this is the phenomenon of dimen-
sional transmutation and asymptotic freedom. therefore
the coset and its perturbation have the general properties
of a sigma model.

for principal chiral models, this result is already
known [13], and is very reminiscent of an earlier method
involving taking the limit of an innite number of a-
vors of fermions [9]. since dimg  dimh = dim h here,
the perturbation o of the coset hk  hk/h2k is in the
adjoint of h2k. the usual coset notation for such an
operator is (1, 1; adjoint). this means that the corre-
sponding g is a descendant of the identity primary eld
in the hk conformal eld theories (i.e. j a operating on
the vacuum), and the h in its decomposition are in
the adjoint of h2k. such an operator is often called the
thermal operator (e.g. when k = 1 and h = su (2),
o is the thermal operator in the ising model). the
particles in the perturbed coset models are kinks whose
exact s matrices were conjectured in [1315]. the coset
model for nite k does not have an h symmetry, but
rather the states form representations of quantum-group
algebra h{q} (a deformation of the h lie algebra) with
q =  exp(i/(k + h)). the kinks are in the fundamen-
tal representations of h{q}. as k  , q  1 and
the quantum-group algebra reverts to the ordinary lie
algebra of h. for example, for su (4), this means that
particles are in the 4, the 6 and the 4 representations,
giving 14 particles all together. once an intertwiner is
used to change basis, the s matrices in the k   limit
are those conjectured for the h  h/h sigma models in
[3]. the exact free energy for the coset models was found
in [16], using results of [17,18].

in the o(3) sigma model, the elds take values on
the sphere. the curvature (or equivalently, the radius)
of the sphere determines the mass scale of the model.
in the sigma model language used here, this corresponds
to a sigma model on the symmetric space o(3)/o(2) 

2

su (2)/u (1) sigma model.
in this case, the conjecture
above was put forth in [6]. there it was phrased as tak-
ing the k   limit of the zk parafermion theories per-
turbed by the operator 11 + h.c.. parafermions are
a generalization of fermions which instead pick up zk
phases when taken around one another; i(z) and i(z)
are the parafermions, where i runs from 1 to k  1. the
zk parafermion models can be described by the coset
su (2)k/u (1), and the operator j 1 here is indeed the
parafermion 1, while j 2 = 
1 [19]. as opposed to
the principal chiral models, the particles here are in the
vector representation of o(3). thus our result provides
a natural explanation and generalization of the conjec-
ture of [6]. one interesting thing about this model is
that a topological theta term can be added to the action.
putting  =  corresponds to adding the operator io to
the action of the coset model [6]. the partition function
is still real, because only even powers of the perturbation
appear in the expansion.

we now turn to the general o(n) model, which our
conjecture says should be described by a perturbation of
the o(n)k/o(n1)k sigma model. there are n1 elds
j a, which are in the vector representation of o(n1).
the quadratic casimir of this representation is (n2)/2
for n > 4, so the operator o is of dimension 2  (n
2)/(k + n  3)). to proceed further, we make use of a
level-rank duality which shows that o(n)k/o(n1)k coset
model is equivalent to o(k)n1  o(k)1/o(k)n [20]. in
this dual coset model, the operator o is (vector,vector;
1). this is precisely the electric-type perturbation dis-
cussed in [21]. there it is shown that this model remains
integrable under this perturbation, and that it follows
from the non-local symmetries that the kinks are in the
vector representation of o(n){q}.
(this is to be con-
trasted to the thermal perturbation of these coset models
where the particles are in the fundamental (spinor) rep-
resentations [15].) if we take k   to reach the sigma
model, the quantum group turns into the ordinary alge-
bra o(n) with the particles in the vector representation.
this is the classic result of [2]. the s matrices must of
course be the same.

even though the exact s matrix for these integrable
sigma models has been known for 20 years, the free en-
ergy at non-zero temperature has not been computed.
one usually can calculate the free energy of an integrable
model by using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz [22].
this works by rst nding the bethe equations, whose
solutions give all the energy levels. these equations are
coupled polynomial equations (of number of particles in
the system), and so are not solvable in closed form ex-
cept perhaps for some low-lying energy levels. to com-
pute the free energies, one doesnt need every solution,
just the one with the lowest free energy. this can often
be found by utilizing the string hypothesis, nding the
patterns the roots of these polynomial equations obey in

the continuum limit. for an s matrix with particles in
the vector of o(n), the bethe equations are known [23],
but the appropriate string hypothesis was not.

for particles in the vector of the quantum-group alge-
bra o(n){q}, this problem has been solved by deriving
functional relations relating various quantities, including
the hamiltonian [17]. there the computation was done
for a lattice rsos model where the links of the lat-
tice are in some representation of a lie algebra [17,18].
the boltzmann weights of the rsos model with links in
the vector representation of o(n){q} chain are precisely
the s matrix of the perturbed o(n)k/o(n1)k coset (up
to an overall function which makes ss = 1; this factor
was worked out in [21]). this computation can then be
used to nd the bethe equations for the eld theory (an
analogous computation and references are in [8]).

finding the free energy of the perturbed o(n)k/o(n
1)k models is now straightforward. we then can take
the k   limit to obtain the free energy of the sigma
model. we rst discuss n even, where o(n) is simply
laced. the function 0() is dened so that the lling
fraction of particles at rapidity  and temperature t is
1/(1 + exp(0())) (the lling fraction is the density of
particles divided by the density of states). equivalently,
t 0() is the energy it takes to create a particle of energy
m cosh  over the fermi sea; the mass m of a particle is
related to the sigma model coupling (the radius of the
n1 dimensional sphere) in [5]. we also dene a set of
magnon energies (a)
r (), where r = 1 . . . k  1 and a =
1 . . . n/2. the functionals a(a)

r () are dened as

r () z 

a(a)



d
2

1

cosh(  )

ln(1 + ea

r ( ))

r () is dened with   . the matrix iab is
2  cab, where cab is the cartan matrix for o(n), while

while ea(a)
the matrix eirs = r,s1 + r,s+1. finally, with mab(x) =

2 cosh(x/2)ab  iab and m1 its matrix inverse, the
function fa() is dened as the fourier transform

fa() =z 



dx
2

eix(m1)1a(x)

then an extension of the results of [17] yields the follow-
ing integral equations, valid for even n  4 and k  2:

0() =

r = a0 r,1a,1 +

(5)

the free energy per unit length is then given by

mt

f =

(6)

the structure for n odd is more complicated. for exam-
ple, the range of r depends on the value of (a). neverthe-
less, the results can be extracted from [18]. the function
mab is given by their equation (b.10), while the second
equation in (5) is replaced by their (b.4a) with its left-
hand side replaced by a0r,1a,1.

these equations are straightforward to solve numeri-
cally. we have checked that the free energy in the ultra-
violet limit (m  0) gives the correct value, proportional
to the central charge c = k(n  1)(2k + n  4)/(2(k +
n  3)(k + n  2)) of the o(n)k/o(n1)k conformal eld
theory. the equations remain well-dened as k  ;
an innite number of magnons is a generic characteristic
of models with lie algebra symmetries (as opposed to
quantum-group structure).

we have found a broadly-applicable and useful feature
of g/h sigma models, a feature which we have conjec-
tured to be completely general. moreover, simple ex-
tensions of this conjecture allow for topological or wess-
zumino terms in the sigma model action, and also to
supersymmetric sigma models. we think the above ar-
guments are convincing for integrable sigma models, but
nonintegrable sigma models remain mostly unexplored.
one particularly interesting situation is the cp n1 sigma
model, which has g = su (n) and h = su (n1)  u (1).
this has long been believed to be not integrable, ex-
cept for n=2, where su (2)/u (1)  o(3)/o(2). the
evidence against integrability is that a counting argu-
ment does not yield a local conserved charge at grade 3
[24], and that anomalies appear in the non-local conser-
vation laws [25]. neither of these facts settle the mat-
ter; for example both phenomena happen in toda the-
ories with non-simply laced groups, which are still inte-
grable [26]. our conjecture may provide a useful way
of checking integrability and exploring other properties.
the su (n)k/su (n1)k  u (1) coset model is dual to the
wn minimal model su (k)n1  su (k)1/su (k)n. in
this language, the perturbing operator o is the (k, k; 1)
operator; k is the fundamental representation of su (k).
these models have a nonlocal symmetry generated by
the chiral part of the (1, 1; k) operator. for k=2, this
model is the 21 perturbation of the nth minimal model
[1]. both this and the k=3 case [21] are integrable. for
k > 3, the counting argument used to prove integrability
for k=2 and k=3 does not yield a conserved current just
like for the sigma model. so while the prospects for in-
tegrability do not seem good, it has not been ruled out.
one way of checking numerically would be to utilize our
conjecture and the truncated conformal scaling approach
[27]. there one nds the low-lying energy levels of the
theory; a signal of integrability is that the levels can cross
as the strength of the perturbation is varied.
