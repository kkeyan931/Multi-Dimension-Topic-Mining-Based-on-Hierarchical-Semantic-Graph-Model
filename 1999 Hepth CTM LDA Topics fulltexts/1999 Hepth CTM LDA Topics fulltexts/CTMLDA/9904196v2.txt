abstract

we use n=2 harmonic and projective superspaces to formulate the most general
ansatz for the su(2)r-invariant hypermultiplet low-energy eective action (leea)
in four dimensions, which describes the two-parametric family of the hyper-kahler
metrics generalizing the atiyah-hitchin metric. we then demonstrate in the very
explicit and manifestly n=2 supersymmetric way that the (magnetically charged,
massive) single hypermultiplet leea in the underlying non-abelian n=2 supersym-
metric quantum eld theory can receive both perturbative (e.g., in the coulomb
branch) and non-perturbative (e.g., in the higgs branch) quantum corrections. the
manifestly n=2 supersymmetric feynman rules in harmonic superspace can be used
to calculate the perturbative corrections described by the taub-nut metric. the
non-perturbative corrections (due to instantons and anti-instantons) can be encoded
in terms of an elliptic curve, which is very reminiscent to the seiberg-witten theory.
our four-dimensional results agree with the three-dimensional seiberg-witten theory
and instanton calculations.

1 introduction

the exact gauge low-energy eective action (leea) in the coulomb branch of n=2
supersymmetric yang-mills theory in four spacetime dimensions (4d), which includes
both perturbative (one-loop) and nonperturbative (instanton) quantum corrections,
was determined by seiberg and witten [1]. the main tools of their construction
were the general constraints implied by n=2 extended supersymmetry, the known
anomaly structure, and electric-magnetic duality. the n=2 o-shell supersymmetry
implies the unique ansatz for the n=2 (abelian) vector multiplet leea, in terms
of a holomorphic function f (w ) of the n=2 (restricted chiral) supereld strength
w . the chiral anomaly determines the perturbative (logarithmic) contribution to
the function f (w ). nonperturbative consistency and duality unambiguously x the
instanton corrections to f (w ), which are related to the bps monopoles representing
nonperturbative degrees of freedom and belonging to hypermultiplets. the exact
seiberg-witten (su(2)-based) solution can be encoded in terms of an elliptic curve
sw, by integrating certain abelian dierential sw over the torus periods.

since a generic 4d, n=2 gauge eld theory has both n=2 vector multiplets and
hypermultiplets, the latter may also have their own n=2 supersymmetric leea [2].
the hypermultiplet leea is highly constrained by n=2 extended supersymmetry and
its automorphisms too, so that its exact form can also be determined. for instance,
in three spacetime dimensions, seiberg and witten [3] used the so-called c-map [4],
relating the special kahler geometry of the n=2 vector multiplet moduli space to
the hyper-kahler geometry of the hypermultiplet moduli space. they further argued
that the atiyah-hitchin (ah) metric [5] is the only regular exact solution. 3 this
proposal was later conrmed by 3d instanton calculations [6], which also discovered
a one-parameter family of possible hyper-kahler metrics generalizing the ah met-
ric. we propose the most general ansatz for the 4d hypermultiplet leea, which
is compatible with all unbroken symmetries and has two parameters.
it allows us
to reformulate the solution in the very transparent geometrical way. the earlier ap-
proaches [3, 6] are formulated only in 3d on the gauge eld theory side, and they
are not manifestly supersymmetric, which may cast some doubt on their ultimate
consistency.

our main purpose in this letter is a derivation of the exact hypermultiplet leea
directly in four spacetime dimensions, in the manifestly n=2 supersymmetric way.
we conne ourselves to a single hypermultiplet for simplicity. we fully exploit the

3an abelian gauge vector is dual to a scalar in three dimensions.

2

restrictions implied by o-shell n=2 supersymmetry and its su(2)r automorphisms,
by making both of them manifest in hss. converting the hss action into n=2
projective superspace (pss) allows us to calculate the eective hyper-kahler metric.
the solution can be put into the seiberg-witten form after introducing the auxiliary
elliptic curve associated with an o(4) projective multiplet in n=2 pss.

2 n=2 supersymmetry and hyper-kahler metrics

the scalar kinetic part of the hypermultiplet leea is of the second order in spacetime
derivatives, so that it has the form of a non-linear sigma-model (nlsm). by n=2
supersymmetry in 4d, the metric of this 4d nlsm has to be hyper-kahler [7]. making
n=2 supersymmetry manifest (i.e o-shell) also makes manifest the hyper-kahler
nature of the hypermultiplet leea. in the harmonic superspace (hss) approach [8],
both an n=2 vector multiplet and a hypermultiplet can be introduced o-shell on
equal footing. for example, the fayet-sohnius hypermultiplet is described by an
unconstrained complex analytic supereld q+ of u(1) charge (+1), whereas an n=2
vector multiplet is described by an unconstrained analytic supereld v ++ of u(1)
charge (+2).

the general n=2 nlsm lagrangian in hss reads [9]

l(+4) = 



q +d++q+  k(+4)(



q +, q+; u) ,

(2.1)

where k+(4) is called a hyper-kahler potential, while the harmonic covariant derivative
d++ includes central charges. the n=2 central charge z can be treated as the abelian
n=2 vector supereld background whose n=2 gauge supereld strength is given by
hwi = z [10]. the role of the analytic function k+(4) in the hypermultiplet leea
(2.1) is similar to the role of the holomorphic seiberg-witten potential f in the n=2
gauge leea. because of manifest n=2 supersymmetry by construction, the equations
of motion for the hss action (2.1) determine (at least, in principle) the component
hyper-kahler nlsm metric in terms of a single analytic function k(+4). an explicit
form of this relation is, however, not known in general. a crucial simplication arises
when the su(2)r automorphisms of n=2 supersymmetry are also preserved, which
implies that the hyper-kahler potential is independent upon harmonics. since su(2)r
is known to be non-anomalous [1, 3], the most general ansatz for the hypermultiplet
leea takes the form of a real quartic polynomial,

k(+4) = 
2 (



q +)2(q+)2 +"



(q+) 4 + 



(q+) 3q+ + h.c.# ,

(2.2)

3

with one real () and two complex (, ) parameters. the sp(1)pg internal symmetry
of the free hypermultipet action leaves the form of the quartic (2.2) invariant but
not the coecients. hence, sp(1)pg can be used to reduce the number of coupling
constants in the family of hyper-kahler metrics associated with the hyper-kahler
potential (2.2) from ve to two. equations (2.1) and (2.2) also imply the conservation
law [9]

on the equations of motion, d++



d++k(+4) = 0
q + = k(+4)/q+ and d++q+ = k(+4)/

(2.3)



q +.

3 perturbative hypermultiplet leea

the manifestly n=2 supersymmetric hss description of the hypermultiplet leea
allows us to exploit the constraints imposed by unbroken n=2 supersymmetry and its
automorphism symmetry in the very ecient and transparent way. for example, as
regards a perturbation theory in 4d, n=2 supersymmetric qed (or in the coulomb
branch of n=2 supersymmetric su(2) yang-mills theory [1]), the unbroken symmetry
is given by

su(2)r, global  u(1)local .

(3.1)

the unique hypermultiplet self-interaction consistent with n=2 supersymmetry

and the internal symmetry (3.1) in hss is described by the hyper-kahler potential

k(+4)
tn =

q +q+(cid:19)2

,

(3.2)

just because it is the only function of u(1) charge (+4) that is independent upon
harmonics and invariant under u(1)local .

the coupling constant  in eq. (3.2) (in the one-loop approximation) is determined
by the hss graph shown in fig. 1. the analytic propagator (wave lines in fig. 1) of
the n=2 vector supereld (in n=2 feynman gauge) is (see [10] for details)

the hypermultiplet analytic propagator (solid lines in fig. 1) with non-vanishing
central charges (in the pseudo-real notation) reads [10]

note that  6= 0 only when z 6= 0. the dependence of  upon the ir-cuto is
expected to disappear after summing up all contributions from higher loops.

to understand the hyper-kahler geometry associated with the hyper-kahler po-
tential (3.2), it is convenient to rewrite the hss action into pss, by going partially
on-shell, in terms of an n=2 tensor multiplet. unlike the fayet-sohnius hypermul-
tiplet, the n=2 tensor supereld l(ij) has a nite number of auxiliary elds. in the
standard n=2 superspace (z) the l(ij) is dened by the o-shell constraints

and the reality condition

in terms of the n=1 chiral supereld  and the n=1 real linear supereld h.

the n=2 tensor multipet constraints (3.7) and (3.8) read in hss as

d++l++ = 0 and

l ++ = l++ ,



(3.15)

respectively, where l++ = u+

j lij(z). lets substitute (we temporarily set  = 1)
(3.16)

q +q+ = 2il++ ,

or, equivalently,



which is certainly allowed because of eq. (2.3). the constraints (3.7) can be incor-
porated o-shell by using extra real analytic supereld  as the lagrange multiplier.
q +, q+) to (l++, ) amounts to an n=2 duality trans-
changing the variables from (
formation in hss. the explicit solution to eq. (3.16) reads



q+ = i(cid:16)2u+

1(cid:17) ei/2 ,



q + = i(cid:16)2u+

(3.17)

f ++(l, u) =

.

(3.18)

it is straightforward to rewrite the free (massless) hss action (2.7) in terms of the
new variables. it results in the improved (i.e. n=2 superconformally invariant) n=2
tensor multiplet action [11]

simpr. =

1

2 z d (4)du(f ++)2 .

(3.19)

(3.20)

the action dual to the nlsm action dened by eqs. (2.1) and (3.2) is thus given by
a sum of the non-improved (quadratic) and improved (non-polynomial) hss actions
for the n=2 tensor multiplet [7, 11],
1

stn[l; ] = simpr. +

2 z d (4)duh(l++)2 + d++l++i .

the equivalent pss action is given by eq. (3.11) with

i g = m ic0

(q2

+icr

q2

2(ln q2

2  1) ,

(3.21)

where we have restored the dependence upon  by setting m = 1
21/2. the contour
c0 in complex -plane goes around the origin, whereas the contour cr encircles the
roots of the quadratic equation [7]

q2

2() = 0 .

(3.22)

the hyper-kahler metric of the n=2 nlsm dened by eqs. (3.21) and (3.22) is
equivalent to the taub-nut metric with the mass parameter m = 1

21/2 [7, 9].

the su(2)r transformations act in pss in the form of projective (fractional)

transformations [12]

  =

a  b
a + b

,

|a|2 + |b|2 = 1 ,

(3.23)

while a generic pss action (3.11) is not invariant under these transformations. nev-
ertheless, eq. (3.11) with some non-trivial contour cr is going to be invariant under
the transformations (3.23) provided that



g(q2
2

( ),  ) =

1

(a + b)2 g(q2

2(), ) , where q2
2



( ) =

1

(a + b)2 q2

2() .

(3.24)

eq. (3.24) implies that the invariant pss potential g(q2
2) should be almost linear
in q2
2, like in the second term of the action (3.21). the transition ui  i = (1, )
describes the holomorphic projection of hss on pss, where the analytic supereld
l++(, u) is replaced by the holomorphic (with respect to ) section q2
2(l, ) of the
line bundle o(2) whose ber is parametrized by constrained superelds. the equation
(3.13) denes the riemann sphere in c2 parametrized by (q2, ).

4 exact hypermultiplet leea and o(4) bundle

in an abelian quantum eld theory there are no instantons, so that the one-loop
results of sect. 3 are, in fact, exact in that case. if, however, the underlying n=2
gauge eld theory has a non-abelian gauge group whose rank is more than one, one
expects nonperturbative contributions to the leea of a single (magnetically charged)
hypermultiplet from instantons and anti-instantons [13]. it may happen, e.g., in the
higgs branch where the gauge symmetry is completely broken.

given the most general su(2)r-invariant hyper-kahler potential (2.2), lets make

a substitution

(q+) 4 +

where the real analytic supereld l++++ satises the conservation law (2.3),

d++l++++ = 0 .

(4.2)

eq. (4.2) can be recognized as the o-shell n=2 (standard) superspace constraints

l lijkl(z), while eq. (4.1) implies the reality condition

lijkl = imjnkplqlmnpq ,

(4.4)

dening together the o(4) projective multiplet [12]. unlike the o(2) tensor super-
multiplet (sect. 3), the o(4) supermultiplet does not have a conserved vector (or a
gauge antisymmetric tensor) amongst its eld components.

the n=2 invariant pss action construction (3.11) in terms of a pss potential
4(), ) equally applies to the projective o(4) supermultiplets, 4 while lijkl should

g(q2

respectively, in terms of the n=1 chiral supereld , the n=1 complex linear super-
eld h, and the n=1 general (unconstrained) real supereld v [7, 12].

the n=1 supereld v enters the action (4.7) as the lagrange multiplier, whose

elimination via its equation of motion implies the algebraic constraint [12]

re i g

(4.8)

eq. (4.8) reduces the number of independent n=2 nlsm physical real scalars from
ve to four, which is consistent with the well-known fact that the real dimension of any
hyper-kahler manifold is a multiple of four [7]. after solving the constraint (4.8), the
complex linear n=1 supereld h can be traded for yet another n=1 chiral supereld
, by the use of the n=1 supereld legendre transform that results in the n=1
superspace kahler potential k(, , , ) associated with the n=2 supersymmetric
nlsm of eq. (4.7) [7].

the most straightforward procedure of calculating the dependence q(l), as well
as performing an explicit n=2 transformation of the unconstrained hss action into
the pss action in terms of the constrained n=2 supereld dened by eq. (4.1), use
roots of the quartic polynomial. remarkably, the n=2 pss action in question can be
xed without calculating the roots in the manifestly n=2 supersymmetric approach.
it is the su(2)r invariance that is powerful enough to x the pss action equivalent
to the hss action of eqs. (2.1) and (2.2) (cf. ref. [11]). the one real and two complex
constants, (, , ), respectively, parametrizing the hyper-kahler potential (2.2), are
naturally united into the su(2) 5-plet cijkl subject to the reality condition (4.4).
after extracting a constant piece out of q+, say, q+
a and ua = (1, ), and
collecting all constant pieces on the left-hand-side of eq. (4.1), we can identify their
sum with a constant piece c++++ = cijklu+
l of l++++ on the right-hand-side of
eq. (4.1), representing the constant vacuum expectation values of the n=1 supereld
components of l++++ dened by eq. (4.6), i.e.

a = u+

a + q+

i u+

j u+

(4.9)

the su(2)r transformations in pss are the projective transformations (3.24), so
that the pss potential g of the improved o(4) multiplet action having the form

(3.11) must be proportional to q4  qq2

4 because of the relations



g(q2

the most general non-trivial contour cr in complex -plane, whose denition is com-
patible with the projective su(2) symmetry, is the one encircling the roots of the
quartic (cf. sect. 3),

q2

4()(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

= p + q + 2r  3 q + 4 p ,

(4.11)

with one real (r) and two complex (p, q) additional parameters belonging to yet
another 5-plet of su(2). the projective su(2) invariance of the pss action dened by
eqs. (4.7) and (4.11) can be used to reduce the number of independent parameters in
the corresponding family of hyper-kahler metrics from ve to two, which is consistent
with the hss predictions of sect. 2. 5 we didnt attempt to establish an explicit
relation between the hss coecients (, , ) and the pss coecients (r, q, p). the
most natural (non-trivial) contour cr surrounds the roots of the equation

q2

4() = 0 ,

(4.12)

and it leads to the only non-singular hyper-kahler nlsm metric (sect. 5).

the su(2)-invariant pss action, equivalent to the one dened by eqs. (2.1) and

(4.1), is therefore given by

the branch cuts of the root in eq. (4.14) can be chosen to run from 1 to 1/2 and
from 2 to 1/1. the contour integration in eq. (4.14) can thus be reduced to the
complete elliptic integral (in the legendre normal form) over the branch cut [14],

k = 1  k2  4 exp  1

! ,

(4.24)

and describe the same limit at   0. after substituting eq. (4.23) into eq. (4.21)
one nds that the ah metric becomes exponentially close to the taub-nut metric
in the form (4.20) subject to the additional relations:

a2  b2 

1 + 

2

, c 2 

1

1 + 

.

(4.25)

the extra u(1) symmetry of the taub-nut metric is the direct consequence of the
relation a2 = b2 arising from the ah metric in the asymptotic limit described by
eq. (4.25). the vicinity of k  0+ describes the region of the hypermultiplet moduli
space where quantum perturbation theory applies, with the exponentially small ah
corrections to the taub-nut metric being interpreted as the one-instanton and anti-
instanton contributions to the hypermultiplet leea [3, 6].

from the n=2 pss viewpoint, the transition from the perturbative hypermulti-
plet leea to the nonperturbative one corresponds to the transition from the o(2)
holomorphic line bundle associated with the standard n=2 tensor supermultiplet to
the o(4) holomorphic line bundle associated with the o(4) n=2 supermultiplet. the
two holomorphic bundles are topologically dierent: with respect to the standard
covering of cp (1) by two open ane sets, the o(2) bundle has transition functions
1, whereas the o(4) bundle has transition functions 2. the variable q is the
coordinate of the corresponding ber over cp (1).

5 atiyah-hitchin metric and elliptic curve

the quadratic dependence of q2
2 on  in eqs. (3.10) and (3.13) allows us to globally
interpret it as a holomorphic (of degree 2) section of pss, bered by the superelds
(, h) and topologically equivalent to a complex line (or riemann sphere of genus
0). similarly, the quartic dependence of q2
4 on  in eqs. (4.5) and (4.6) allows us
to globally interpret it as a holomorphic (of degree 4) section of pss, bered by
the superelds (, h, v ) and topologically equivalent to an elliptic curve hyper. (or
a torus of genus 1). the non-perturbative hypermultiplet leea can therefore be
encoded in terms of the genus-one riemann surface hyper. in close analogy to the
exact n=2 gauge leea in terms of the elliptic curve sw of seiberg and witten [1].

the classical twistor construction of hyper-kahler metrics [5] is known to be closely
related to the hurtubise elliptic curve h [15]. this curve can be identied with hyper.

12

that carries the same information and whose dening eq. (4.6) can be put into the
hurtubise form,

q2

4( ) = k 2(k) hkk( 2  1) + (k2  k2) i ,

(5.1)

by a projective su(2) transformation. in its turn, eq. (5.1) is simply related (by a
linear transformation) to another standard (weierstrass) form, y2 = 4x3  g2x  g3.
therefore, in accordance with ref. [5], the real period  of h is

  4k1 , where

4k2

1 = kkk 2(k) ,

whereas the complex period matrix of h is given by

 =

ik(k)
k(k)

.

(5.2)

(5.3)

at generic values of the ah modulus k, 0 < k < 1, the roots of the weierstrass
form are all dierent from each other, while they all lie on the real axis, say, at
e3 < e2 < e1 <  = (e4). accordingly, the branch cuts are running from e3 to e2
and from e1 to . the cr integration contour in the pss formulation of the exact
hypermultiplet leea in eq. (4.13) can now be interpreted as the contour integral over
the non-contractible -cycle of the elliptic curve h [16], again in the very similar way
as the seiberg-witten solution to the su(2)-based n=2 gauge leea is written down
in terms of the abelian dierential sw integrated over the periods of sw [1]. the
most general (non-trivial) integration contour cr in eq. (4.13) is given by a linear
combination of the non-contractible  and  cycles of h, while an integration over
 is known to lead to a singularity [5]. this simple observation implies that the ah
metric is the only regular solution.

the perturbative (taub-nut) limit k  1 corresponds to the situation when
e2  e1, so that the -cycle of h degenerates. the curve (5.1) then asymptotically
approaches a complex line, q4  k . another limit, k  0, leads to a (coordinate)
bolt-type singularity of the ah metric in the standard parameterization (4.20) [5].
in the context of monopole physics, this corresponds to the coincidence limit of two
centered monopoles.
in the context of the hypermultiplet leea, k  0 implies
e2  e3, so that the -cycle of h degenerates, as well as the whole hypermultiplet
action associated with eq. (4.13). the two limits, k  1 and k  0, are related by
the modular transformation exchanging k with k, and -cycle with -cycle [16]. the
non-perturbative corrections to the hypermultiplet leea are therefore dictated by
the hidden (in 4d) elliptic curve parametrizing the exact solution.
