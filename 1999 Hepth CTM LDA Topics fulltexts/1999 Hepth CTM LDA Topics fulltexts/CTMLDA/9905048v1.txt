massive symmetric tensor eld on ads

abstract

the two-point green function of a local operator in cft corresponding to a massive
symmetric tensor eld on the ads background is computed in the framework of the
ads/cf t correspondence. the obtained two-point function is shown to coincide with
the two-point function of the graviton in the limit when the mass vanishes.

1 introduction

the ads/cf t correspondence was conjectured in [1] and stated that in the large n limit and
at large t hooft coupling  = g2
y m n the classical supergravity/m-theory on the anti-de sitter
space (ads) times a compact manifold is dual to a certain su(n) conformal gauge theory
(cf t ) dened on the boundary of ads. one notable example of this correspondence being
the duality between d = 4, n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory and d = 10 type iib
supergravity theory on ads5  s5. the precise formulation of the conjecture was given in [2],
[3] where it was proposed to identify the generating functional for connected green functions of
local operators in cft with the on shell value of the supergravity action under the restriction
that the supergravity elds satisfy the dirichlet conditions on the boundary of ads. recall
that in the standard representation of ads as an upper-half space x0 > 0, xk  r, k = 1, . . . d
with the metric

ds2 = gdxdx =

1
x2

0 (cid:16)dx0dx0 + ijdxidxj(cid:17) ,

where ij could be either minkowksi or euclidean, the boundary includes the plane x0 = 0 as
well as the point x0 = . since the boundary is located innitely far away from any point
in the interior the supergravity action is infrared divergent and must be regularized. as was
pointed out in [4] the consistent regularization procedure (with respect to ward identities)
requires one to shift the boundary of ads to the surface in the interior dened by x0 = . then
the dirichlet boundary value problem for supergravity elds is properly dened and one can
compute the on shell value of the supergravity action as a functional of the boundary elds.

with the account of this regularization procedure the standard formulation of the ads/cf t
correspondence assumes the form:

ho(x1)  o(xn)i = lim

0



1(x1)   



n(xn)

son shell (1(x1), . . . , n(xn))|i(xi)=i(x0=,xi),

where xi are points on the boundary of adsd+1, oi(xi) are gauge invariant composite operators
in cf t and i(xi) are the corresponding supergravity elds. here we used the convention in
which the coordinates x of adsd+1 are split according to: x = (x0, x), so that x  rd. the
action son shell is the sum of the bulk supergravity action and the boundary terms necessary to
make the ads/cf t correspondence complete. the origin of these boundary terms was eluci-
dated in [5] where it was shown that they appear in passing from the hamiltonian description
of the bulk action to the lagrangian one.

the ads/cf t correspondence has been tested by computing various two- and three-point
functions of local operators in d = 4, n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory on ads5.
in particular two-point functions corresponding to scalars [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], vectors [3], [4],
[9], [10] spinors [10], [11], rarita-schwinger elds [12], [13], antisymmetric form elds [14] -
[16] and gravitons [5], [17], [18] were computed on the ads background. the only eld in the
supergravity spectrum [19] that has evaded the attention is the massive symmetric second-rank
tensor eld dened by the action found in [20] for the case of ads5 and its natural generalization
for adsd+1.
in this paper we ll in the gap by computing the remaining two-point green
function.

we note that the dirichlet boundary value problem for the massive symmetric tensor eld
is nontrivial due to the fact that the equations of motion for various components are coupled
which presents a serious obstacle. furthermore, in computing the two-point green function we
have to stick with the regularization procedure described above in order to obtain consistent
results. at the end of our computation we nd that in the limit when the mass vanishes the
correlation function reduces to that of the massless symmetric tensor eld, i.e. the graviton.

2 equations of motion

the starting point in the calculation is the action for the symmetric traceless second-rank tensor
ab on adsd+1 which is a generalization of the action derived in [20]:

m2(cid:19) , (2.1)

where g is the determinant of the ads metric g. let us note that this action already contains
the appropriate boundary terms and so can be readily used for computing the two-point green
function. the action (2.1) leads to the following equations of motion

  

  

 + (2  m2) = 0,

(2.2)

where  is the levi-civita connection computed on the ads background. the massive term
in (2.2) destroys the standard symmetry  =  +  which is present in the case of
the massless symmetric tensor eld (graviton) [5]. as a result of this symmetry breaking one

can no longer impose any gauge condition on 
component 0

0 from the equations of motion by using the constraint:

 . since 

 is traceless, we can eliminate the

0 = tr  b

in what follows in will be convenient to introduce a concise notation:

(2.3)

starting from (2.2) one can obtain the following system of coupled dierential equations for
various components of the eld

some comments are in order. equations (i), (iii) and (v) are simply (ij), (0i) and (00)
components of (2.2), respectively; equations (ii) and (iv) are obtained from (i) and (iii),
respectively, by dierentiating with respect to xi and (vi) is the trace of (i). to simplify the
notation, we chose the convention in which indices i, j = 1, . . . , 4 are raised and lowered with
the at metric ij so that, in particular,  = ijij. also for deniteness we will assume that
the at metric ij is eucliden: ij = ij. obviously, all our results can be easily extended to
the case when ij is minkowski.

recall that in the case of the graviton it proved convenient to decompose the tensor eld
into the transversal and the longitudinal components [5]. encouraged by this example, we
introduce the transversal part of i

(2.6)

here we used (iii) in order to express 0kk
j in terms of j and j. next we would like to
eliminate the unphysical elds i appearing in the rst term in square brackets. to achieve
this goal we need to nd an additional equation that would allow us to express the unphysical
elds mentioned above in terms of various components of i
j and that would be simple enough
to be substituted into eq.(2.6). to nd this equation, we take advantage of (iii) to get rid of
0kk

(2.14)

j as well as the contraction of l

from denition (2.12) it follows that to obtain the transversal part of i

j we need to know
m with the dierential operator lm. so let us
the trace  of i
rst concentrate on the eld . it is clear that to nd  we need to somehow combine (v) and
(vi). the way to do it is as follows. first we subtract (v) from (vi) and divide the obtained
equation by 2 to get:

 d  1

x2

(d  1)d

x2

(2.15)

then dierentiating (2.15) with respect to x0 gives:

to simplify this equation substitute the l.h.s. of (v) for 2(0  1

x0

). as a result we nd:

m2

m2

x0 !   0lml

now we note that the r.h.s. of this equation coincides with the r.h.s. of (iv) and by taking
advantage of this one arrives at a simple relation between the eld  and :

 0 

d + 1

x0 !  = .

(2.16)

with the same value for  as in (2.13). now we show how to determine c(, k). first, we
eliminate the eld  from (2.15) by using constraint equation (vii):

to compute the green function in the framework of the ads/cf t correspondence we need to
evaluate the on shell value of the action. taking into account the equations of motion (2.2) one
nds that the on shell value of action (2.1) is

son shell[

(cid:16)2 + kk(cid:17)! . (3.1)

let us rst consider the contribution to son shell that depends locally on boundary elds, i.e.
does not contain the normal derivative 0. we expect that such terms do not contribute to the
non-local part of son shell. thus we need to consider the behavior of  and k on the boundary
of ads. to this end we note that according to (2.18) and with the account of (2.30) the eld
(k) is local while i(k) is equal to:

i(k) = (i)hg

(k)(cid:17) kiklkm
k2 l
taking into account (2.31) and (2.32) we nd that in the limit   0, (g
(k)) is
o(k)2 so that i(k) is a local eld. consequently, the terms that depend locally on boundary
elds do not contribute to the non-local part of son shell as we expected.

(3.2)

next we consider terms with the normal derivative 0. in evaluating such terms it is useful

to employ the following identity

d

dx0 (cid:18)x0

f (k) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)x0=
 (cid:19)n f (x0k)

(3.3)

from this identity it follows that we need to know the power series expansion of the logarithmic
derivative of each function that enters into (2.28). these expansions are:

where  =

which evidently lead to local expressions as well as terms of order 2+1 which become negligible
in the limit   0.
nd that 0(, x) is equal to:

thus, 0 is a local expression and therefore does not contribute to the non-local part of son shell.
consequently, the non-local part is entirely determined by the following expression

(3.7)

where s is the non-local part of son shell. taking into account solution (2.28) for the eld
i
j and expansions (3.4) - (3.6) we see that the expression for 0i
j contains three dierent
contributions: the rst contribution comes from dierentiating the ratio x0
 raised to the power
of d
2 + 2 ; the second contribution comes from o(k2) terms in the power expansion
of the logarithmic derivative of various functions in (2.28) and the third contribution comes
from o(21k2) terms in the same expansion. from (2.28) we can easily read o the rst
contribution which is equal to:

where we again used (2.30) and the rst line of (2.28). adding together (3.9) and (3.8), the
non-local part cancels leading to a purely local expression which does not contribute to s.

in the process of deriving (3.10) we dropped all terms containing i
negligible in the limit   0. to understand why this is so, note that when i
with j
at x0 = .

j since such terms are
j is contracted
j(x) which according to (2.18) is order o(2)

in order to complete the calculation of the two-point green function we need to evaluate
the integral over k in (3.11). to this end, we employ the standard formula for the fourier
transformation of generalized functions [22]:

(3.12)

with the help of (3.12) we nd that the non-local part of the on shell value of the action is
equal to:

j] =

s[i

2 z z ddx ddy

(3.13)

from this we can easily deduce the two-point function of local operators in the boundary cft
corresponding to the massive symmetric traceless rank two tensor eld ij:
