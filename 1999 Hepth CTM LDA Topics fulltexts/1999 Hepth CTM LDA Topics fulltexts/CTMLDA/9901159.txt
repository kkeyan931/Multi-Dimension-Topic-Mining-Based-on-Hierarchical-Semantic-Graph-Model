recently, eect studied abstract perspective k theory . physics simple one naturally wonders whether similar phenomenon exist branes, say, ns5 branes m5 branes. type iib ns5 branes related d5 branes

low energy dynamics, modulo matter periodicity one scalar elds. start paper trying understand happens m5 brane coincides anti-m5 brane. m5 branes type iia ns5 branes admit (2, 0) supersymmetry, world-volume degrees freedom must tensor multiplet, whose bosonic eld content include chiral 2-form b+ n . anti-m5 admits anti-chiral 2-form eld b. m5-anti-m5 world-volume, combined unrestricted

note that, unlike case d4 brane pair sum gauge elds couples c3, dierence two gauge eld couples c3. due opposite orientations carried d4 anti-d4. quantized magnetic ux generated winding number

(2) precisely c3 would coupled ordinary d2 brane {$9805019$}, one concludes resulting (2 + 1)-dimensional object must d2 brane {$9808141$}. since d2 brane lightest object carries electric c3 charge, since soliton seem possess spacetime charge, reasonable extrapolation. interestingly enough, least part spacetime supersymmetry restored nal state, trivial vacuum d2 branes. although sense soliton bps respect world-volume theory d4-anti-d4, soliton actually bps respect spacetime supersymmetry. despite lack supersymmetry eective eld theory produces soliton, one still reply soliton mass formula stable continuous change parameters. 3 regard d4-anti-d4 pair m5-anti-m5 pair wrapped compact circle 1, instability persist. dierence tachyonic degrees freedom must arise open membranes stretched ve-branes. boundary membrane ending ve-branes string-like, object condenses tachyonic world-volume string. open string tachyon d4-anti-d4 may regarded tachyonic string wrapped 1. given d2 branes nothing transverse m2 branes, given nal state preserved restored spacetime supersymmetry, conclude m5-anti-m5 pair annihilate produce m2 branes world-volume solitons. let us see phenomenon theory setting detail. m5 brane admits single chiral 2-form b+ whose 3-form eld strength h + restricted self-dual. anti-m5 brane, hand, identical m5 brane, except reverse orientation. orientation turn related chirality massless fermions 2-form tensor. anti-m5 thus admits anti-chiral b, whose eld strength h anti-self-dual. m5-anti-m5 system, two elds combine become whole 2-form eld, denoted bm n . wrap m5-anti-m5 pair circle make d4-anti-d4 pair, bm n reduces pair vector elds. one obtained b5, may identify (a12). remaining tensor b dual vector (4 + 1) dimensions, identied overall u (1) vector as. (it may seem ambiguous two u (1) vectors a12 identied with, say, b5. actually, simply matter convention, since, switching dual eld strength h = h + h place h = h + + h , one eectively exchanges longitudinal transverse parts.) 2-form b unrestricted, dynamics described lagrangian. particular, chern-simon coupling (1) d4-anti-d4 pair must come similar coupling m5-anti-m5 pair wrapped 1, obvious conclusion draw term world-volume lagrangian form {$9805019$}, zr5+1=m5antim5 c3 h.

(although, since eective lagrangian governs long distance dynamics best, meaningful ask exactly m(f ) small f . better prescription might introduce short distance cut-o.) 4 fundamental strings dp-anti-dp; connement discussions previous sections apply cases. observed above, ns5 brane type iia theory essentially low energy behavior m5 brane, analysis show 8 d2 branes produced ns5 brane annihilates anti-ns5 brane. another way see compactify theory neither m5s resulting m2 wrapped 1. one consider alternate compactication m5-anti-m5 string theory conguration, way resulting m2 brane wrapped 1 becomes fundamental string. m2 would lying m5-anti-m5 world-volume, m5s also wrapped 1 become d4s. follows fundamental strings produced d4 brane annihilates anti-d4 brane. one naturally wonders co-dimension-three objects possible d4 brane theory ordinary gauge theory. expanding born-infeld action d4 brane anti-d4 brane, one nds terms, zd4 hb, da1i + zantid4 hb, da2i = zr4+1 hb, d(a1 + a2)i, (16) b ns-ns 2-form eld pulled back common world-volume. two gauge elds summed case, inner product h, insensitive orientation world- volume. clearly electric ux overall u (1) gauge eld a1 + a2 would generate fundamental string charge b. hand, discussions m5-anti-m5, know open d2 ending d4-anti-d4 pair provides string-like tachyonic objects. object magnetically charged respect world-volume gauge elds a1 a2. specically, couples minimally b b 1 b 2 dualize gauge vectors ais gauge 2-form b is. actually implies carries magnetic charge as, rather a12. saw section 3, hodge dual operator anti-d4 extra sign respect one d4, owing reverse orientation. introduces sign dualize gauge eld, nd d(b 1 b 2) = d(a1 + a2), (17) hodge dual operator dened respect d4. thus, tachyonic string indeed magnetically charged respect = a1 + a2. 9 tachyonic string condenses, u (1) gauge eld conned dual higgs mech- anism. remnant conned electric ux string. world-volume coupling (16) induces b charge ux, conned ux string fundamental string type iia theory. let us see gauge-invariant mass term b arises theory picture. must present dual higgs mechanism work overall u (1). already noted that, upon compactication circle, m5-anti-m5 world-volume eld b reduces pair vector elds d4-anti-d4. identied longitudinal part b5 relative u (1) vector (a12), know overall u (1) must dual transverse part b. is, b nothing part b parallel d4-anti-d4 world-volume. would-be goldstone boson gm also reduces single angle = g5 vector = g. b mass term (6) m5-anti-m5 split two pieces. rst, ((a12) )2, mass term (a12), second (b + a)2, mass term dual photon b. (18) (19) identication also provides alternate check all-important topological coupling (3) m5-anti-m5. dimensional reduction coupling (3), 3-form c3 aligned along 1 becomes ns-ns 2-form b, gives us zr4+1 b db = zr4+1 b d(b 1 b 2) = zr4+1 hb, d(a1 + a2)i, (20) is, saw eq. (16), part well-established born-infeld actions d4 brane anti-d4 brane. although analogous theory picture dp-anti-dp pairs, rather clear generalization mechanism arbitrary dp-anti-dp must also exist. open d(p 2) branes ending pair must provide (p 2)-dimensional tachyonic objects, couples 10 overall u (1) gauge eld magnetically. subsequent condensation connes unbroken u (1), fundamental string realized electric ux string. one example clearly seen case d3-anti-d3, sl(2, z) u-duality maps fundamental strings d-strings vice sersa, keeping d3s invariant. 5 summary observed higgs mechanism world-volume 2-form eld b produces co-dimension three solitonic byproducts m5-anti-m5, type iia ns5-anti-ns5, d4-anti-d4 systems. interpreted m2 branes, d2 branes, fundamental strings, respectively. particular, fundamental string emerges d4-anti-d4 pair, nothing conned electric ux string overall u (1) remains unbroken upon condensation open string tachyon. generally, exist pair tachyonic objects dp brane coincident anti-dp brane. one perturbative origin couples relative u (1) electrically, nonperturbative couples overall u (1) magnetically. combined electric magnetic higgs phenomena introduce mass gaps u (1) gauge sectors. remnants d(p 2) branes fundamental strings, realized solitons common (p+1)-dimensional world-volume. particular, neatly addresses question raised witten {$9810188$} unbroken u (1) becomes invisible annihilated dp-anti-dp world-volume. acknowledgment author beneted conversations several visitors korea institute advanced study (kias). kentaro horis probing questions lead many insights paper, mans henningsons expertise m5 brane helpful. all, author grateful kimyeong lee explained higgs mechanism 2-form tensor treated, largely responsible content section 3. author also thanks miao li critical comments. work supported part national science foundation united states. 11
