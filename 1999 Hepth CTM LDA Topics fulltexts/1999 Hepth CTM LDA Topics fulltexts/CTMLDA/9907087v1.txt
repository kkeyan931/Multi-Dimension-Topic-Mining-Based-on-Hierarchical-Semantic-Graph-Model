abstract

we discuss string theory on ads3  s3  m 4 with particular emphasis on unitarity and
state-operator correspondence. the ads-cft correspondence, in the minkowski signature, is
re-examined by taking into account the only allowed unitary representation: the principal series
module of the ane current algebra sl(2,r) supplemented with zero modes. zero modes play
an important role in the description of on-shell states as well as of windings in space-time at
the ads3 boundary. the theory is presented as part of the supersymmetric wzw model that
includes the supergroup su(2/1, 1) (or osp(4/2) or d(2, 1; )) with central extension k. a free
eld representation is given and the vertex operators are constructed in terms of free elds in
sl(2,r) principal series representation bases that are labeled by position space or momentum
space at the boundary of ads3. the vertex operators have the correct operator products with
the currents and stress tensor, all of which are constructed from free elds, including the subtle
zero modes. it is shown that as k  , ads3 tends to at 3d-minkowski space and the ads3
vertex operators in momentum space tend to the vertex operators of at 3d-string theory
(furthermore the theory readjusts smoothly in the rest of the dimensions in this limit).

1 introduction

there has been much discussion on the topic of a string propagating on ads3 curved spacetime
[1]-[16]. the early interest was due to the challenge of solving exactly the problem of a string
theory in curved spacetime with minkowski signature. at the early stages this eort revealed
some problems with ghosts, despite the virasoro constraints. the solution to the problem was
presented several years later in [9] [10] where it was shown that there were two simple but
essential points that were missed in earlier investigations: (i) the correct unitary representation
and (ii) zero modes. both of these are provided naturally by the explicit analysis of the non-
compact sl(2, r) wzw model but it was easy to miss them in the earlier abstract current
algebra approach that included wrong assumptions by analogy to the compact su(2). while
each point is an independent feature of the model they are both needed to correctly describe
the string in ads3 space.

the rst point is that the wzw model based on sl(2,r), in the absence of certain zero
modes (in analogy to su(2)), permits only the unitary representation called the principal series
for which j(j + 1)  1/4 (or j = 1/2 + is where s is real). this is similar to saying
that the model l = r  p for angular momentum permits only integer quanta for angular
momentum; half integer quanta cannot occur in this model. similarly, the discrete series or
the supplementary series modules of ane sl(2, r) current algebra cannot occur in the wzw
model. the ghost problems do not arise in the principal series module, they only arise in
the discrete series module which was wrongly assumed to be part of the model when using
abstract current algebra in the investigations prior to 1995. in recent investigations [12] - [15]
the discrete series module resurfaced in connection with the ads-cft conjecture, however
this is unsatisfactory since the relation to the underlying string theory remains obscure and
the corresponding vertex operators lack unitarity or state-operator correspondence. we show
that there is a subtle solution that incorporates unitarity and state-operator correspondence,
consistent with the underlying unitary string theory spectrum given in [9] [10].

the second point is that a lightcone-type momentum zero mode pl (and a similar p+

r) was
also missed in the old abstract current algebra approach. the zero mode is needed to satisfy
the virasoro mass shell condition (l0 = a) for left movers in the form

l0 = p+

l pl  j(j + 1)/(k  2) + integer = a  1

(1)

(and a similar one for right movers). in the absence of pl the mass shell condition cannot be
satised with the principal series (j(j + 1) = 1
4 + s2) when the positive integer is non-zero
(string excitation level) . the zero mode term p+
l pl provides the only negative contribution (
p+
l pl = p2
l1 < 0) thereby making it possible to satisfy the on shell condition in the same
manner of a string in at spacetime (in fact an excited string in at spacetime also cannot be
put on shell if the p zero mode is absent: p+p + (p2)2 + integer = 1 ). however, the presence
of the pl zero mode in curved spacetime is non-trivial and it requires a quantization condition

l0 + p2

1

due to the periodicity of a closed string x (,  + 2) = x (, ). it was shown in [9] [10] that
due to this monodromy of the sl(2, r) currents, unless pl vanishes, one must have a negative
integer for the combination p+p, that is

p+
l pl = p+

rpr = r,

r  z+ .

(2)

for the compact su(2) (as opposed to the non-compact sl(2, r)) the zero modes pl , p+
r are
not needed, and are taken to vanish. this is why they were missed in the early investigations of
sl(2, r). with these conditions the complete on-shell spectrum of the theory was computed,
the no-ghost theorem was proven (after the virasoro constraints) and the exact unitary solution
of the sl(2, r) wzw model was established [9] [10].

the recent interest in the topic is due to the ads-cft conjecture [17]. the ads3 string
provides one of the rare exact conformal eld theories in which one could possibly verify the
conjecture for a full superstring theory as opposed to the low energy supergravity limit. it is
important to take into account the unitarity of the model as a string on ads3 if this corre-
spondence is to be a meaningful one. recent papers [13] - [15] made progress in providing an
ads3-cft map by suggesting and investigating certain vertex operators constructed in ads3
string theory that correspond to operators in the boundary cft theory. one interesting over-
lap with the previous work [9] [10] involves the quantized zero modes pl , p+
r described above:
they are related to the winding numbers on the ads boundary h d/ , h d/ in the lan-

guage of [13] and [15] (this will be described more fully below). however, the recent papers
did not incorporate the unitarity conditions given in [9] [10] and the operator-physical state
correspondence that is standard and desirable in string theory is obviously lacking. for these
reasons, while the cft-ads ideas in recent papers are very tantalizing, the connection to the
underlying physical string theory remains to be established. we will show that we are not far
from this when we insist on unitarity and use only the principal series of the ane current
algebra supplemented with zero modes.

in this paper we briey review the construction of [9] [10] and present it in the context of
a superstring on ads3  s3  m 4 partially described by the wzw model that includes the
supergroup su(2/1, 1) (or osp(4/2) or d(2, 1; )) with central extension k. we emphasize the
two points mentioned above: (i) only the principal series of the ane sl(2, r) is allowed and
(ii) it must be supplemented by the quantized zero modes pl , p+
r.

we give the free eld representation of the model and then construct the vertex operators
in terms of free elds in two sl(2, r) bases. the sl(2,r) labels on these representations have
the interpretation of either position or momentum at the ads boundary. the momentum space
version was introduced in [10] and subsequently completed in an unpublished work by two of us
[18]; its details will be presented here. the position space version is related to the momentum
space one by ordinary fourier transformation. it is also related to an analytic continuation
of the vertex operator for a string on h 3
+ =sl(2, c) /su (2) used in the recent literature [19]

we also go one step further by constructing the vertex operator from free elds such that
the ads string coordinates  (z, z) ,  (z, z) ,  (z, z) in curved space are themselves constructed
from left and right moving free elds. we show that the free eld representation of the vertex
operators satisfy the correct operator products with the sl(2, r) currents and the stress tensor,
all constructed from left/right free elds. using the free eld construction we show that the
quantized zero modes pl , p+

r are proportional to the winding numbers h d/ , h d/ at the

we show one other desirable property of the vertex operator, namely that it becomes the
at string vertex operator exp(ipx  (z, z)) when the ads3 space tends to at space as the
central extension grows k  .

using the new unitary vertex operators we re-examine the ads-cft correspondence dis-
cussed in recent papers. we show that there is operator- physical state correspondence. also
we show that all the main arguments of the cft-ads correspondence can be reformulated by
using only the unitary vertex operators.

there remains to compute in strictly string theoretical language the various correlation
functions or operator products that would verify or rene the ads-cft correspondence. in
principle our free eld vertex operators can be used to compute any correlation function, but
we leave these computations to future papers.

2 su(2/1, 1) wzw model and free elds

2.1 comments on the supergroup approach

the wzw model based on the non-compact supergroup su(2/1, 1) at level k > 0 has one
timelike and ve spacelike bosonic coordinates; it also has four timelike and four spacelike
fermionic degrees of freedom (see next paragraph). therefore it has ghosts that come from
timelike bosonic and fermionic modes. an additional indication that it contains ghosts is that,
as for any su(n/n) current algebra [21], its virasoro central charge is c = 2 (see footnote
2 of the rst paper listed in [21]). indeed as argued in [16] this is a model for a superstring
on ads3  s3 with ramond-ramond ux, but its degrees of freedom include faddeev-popov
ghosts that arise in the quantization procedure. the physical sector of the model can be
obtained by applying an elaborate set of constraints, as discussed in [16]. a simpler picture
is to consider n = 4 local superconformal symmetry. such a local symmetry provides one
bosonic constraint (usual virasoro) and four fermionic constraints that match the number of
timelike bosonic/fermionic degrees of freedom, thus leading to a ghost-free physical sector.
assuming the suciency of these constraints the wzw model for the supergroup su(2/1, 1)

3

would correspond to a physical superstring theory whose interpretation is obtained through the
arguments of [16].

the counting of timelike degrees of freedom and constraints (gauge invariances) that remove
ghosts is an essential rst step for determining if wzw models (or gauged wzw models) based
on supergroups can be physical superstring theories. a quick way to arrive at the counting is
to consider the signature of the elds in the lagrangian or equivalently the signature in the
operator products of the currents j a. the kinetic term in the lagrangian or the double pole in
the operator product (z  w)2 is proportional to the central extension times the supergroup
2 str(cid:16)t at b(cid:17) where t a is a graded supermatrix that represents the generators
killing metric k
in the fundamental representation1. the timelike/spacelike signature of the bosonic/fermionic
string coordinate (or supergroup parameter) x a (z) that is associated with t a is directly deter-
2 str(cid:16)t at b(cid:17). for su(2/1, 1) with k > 0, the su(2) subalgebra matrices
mined by the sign of k
2 str(cid:16)t at b(cid:17) = kab ; hence the su(2) group parameters correspond to
give a positive signature k
spacelike string coordinates. for the su(1, 1) subalgebra one has k
2 str(t t ) = k where
the extra minus sign comes from the denition of the supertrace, and the sl(2, r) killing met-
ric  is given by 00 = 22 = 11 = 1. therefore, the su(1, 1) parameters correspond to
two spacelike and one timelike coordinates. similarly, for the fermionic parameters one nds 4
spacelike and 4 timelike string degrees of freedom.

2.1.1

supergroups osp(4/2) and d(2, 1; )

as another example consider the supergroup osp(4/2) with compact so(4) and non-compact
sp(2) = sl (2, r). in this case there are 8 spacelike and one timelike bosonic coordinates and 4
spacelike and 4 timelike fermionic ones. the supergroup d(2, 1; ) also has the same counting
(at  = 1 it becomes osp(4/2) ). therefore, physical string theories can be constructed with
the supergroups su(2/1, 1), osp(4/2) and d(2, 1; ) provided the remaining spacelike degrees
of freedom added and then n = 4 superconformal constraints are imposed. for other super-
groups one may consider gauged wzw models based on supergroups that give only one timelike
coordinate (see [22] for the purely bosonic sector) supplemented by appropriate fermionic con-
straints that follow from gauge invariances.

where 12 is the 22 identity matrix and 2 is the pauli matrix (by taking 2 we have chosen the sl(2, r) rather
than the su(1, 1) basis). then the supermatrix t a with a = 1, 2, 3 that correspond to su(2) has non-zero
entries  a (pauli matrices) in the upper left 22 block, the supermatrix t  with  = 0, 1, 2 that correspond to
the su(1, 1)=sl(2, r) subalgebra has non-zero entries   (2, i1,i3) in the lower right 22 block. the
supermatrices t  that correspond to the eight fermionic parameters (4 complex fermions) have non-zero entries
in the o diagonal blocks.

2.2 free elds and reduction to bosonic ads3

returning to su(2/1, 1), the group element can be parametrized at the critical point in the
usual form g (z, z) = gl (z) gr (z). then each of the gl,r can most generally be parametrized
in the triangular form

gl (z) =

this shows that the fermions ,  are free elds and that the analysis of the model is reduced
to solving the left/right factorized bosonic wzw model based on su(2)sl(2, r) at levels
k  2 and k  2 respectively. the su(2) part is well known, therefore we concentrate on the
purely bosonic sl(2, r) part and discuss the purely bosonic string on the ads3 background
by itself. this involves the purely bosonic degrees of freedom gl (z) and the corresponding
currents j  (z) (and their right moving counterparts gr (z) , j  (z)) to which we will return in
the following sections.

note that the combined contribution of the bosonic currents j a, j  to the virasoro central

charge cbosons is independent of k

therefore the value of the central extension k can be changed arbitrarily without changing the
central charge cbosons. this feature will allow us to consider the limit k   for which ads3
tends to at 3d minkowski space while the rest of the theory adjusts to this limit smoothly. in
this limit we will show that our ads3 vertex operator tends to the vertex operator in at 3d
space :exp (ikx  (z, z)) : which is obviously a desired property for the correct vertex operator.
the same procedure can be applied to osp(4/2) and d(2, 1; ) for which again the fermions
are free elds [21] and the non-trivial part is the string on ads3. these supergroups can be
used to describe superstrings on ads3  s3  s3. in this case the bosonic part corresponds
to sl(2, r)su(2)1 su(2)2 at levels k  2, (1 + ) k  2 and (1 + 1/) k  2 respectively
( = 1 is for osp(4/2)). one can then see that cbosons = 9, cf ermi = 8, ctot = 1 are again
independent of k or  and therefore these parameters can be taken to various limits to better
understand the structure of the model.

2.3 bosonic string on ads3

we now discuss the purely bosonic string in an ads3 background. this problem was already
solved satisfactorily in [9] [10] but the lessons learned there remain to be incorporated in the
study of the ads-cft conjecture, which we will address in later sections. in this section we
outline the main important features that relate to unitarity and to zero modes (the notation is
slightly dierent here as compared to [9] [10])

to parametrize the group element in the j = 1/2 representation we use the matrix repre-

sentation t = /2 given in footnote 1. using the lightcone type combinations

this shows that it describes a string with one time-like coordinate and two spacelike coordinates
propagating on the ads3 background. the boundary of ads3 is dened by   .

the classical solution has the form

g (z, z) = gl (z) gr (z)

where gl,r are arbitrary sl(2, r) group elements. note that the gl (z) that appears here is
identied with the gl (z) in the parametrization of the su(2/1, 1) group element gl (z) in eq.(4)
so that the discussion given in this section directly applies to the su(2/1, 1) model. each of
gl,r can always be parametrized in the triangular form given above

the quantum theory at the conformal critical point also takes the form (19). the left/right
currents are j = ik (g) g1 = ik (gl) g1
r (gr). it was shown
in [9] [10] that the quantum theory parametrized in this form reduces to a free eld theory.
the currents and the energy-momentum tensor are then expressed in terms of canonical sets
of free elds: the left moving sets are (x (z) , p + (z)) and (x2 (z) , p2 (z)) in terms of which
the left currents j  (z) take the form (after taking into account normal ordering which shifts
the overall k to k + 2 in the second equation below)

l and j = ikg1 (g) = ikg1

j 1(z) + j 0(z) = p +(z)
j 1(z)  j 0(z) =  : x p +x : 2p2 x + i (k + 2) zx

j2(z) = : x p + : +p2(z)

where the canonical momenta p + and p2 are identied as follows

p +(z) = ikzx +ex2
p2(z) =

therefore x + (z) must be expressed in terms of p +(z) as follows

this free eld representation is similar to wakimotos [23] (with   x and   p +) but
there are two important dierences:

 the elds (x, p +) and (x2, p2) are all hermitian, and similarly all the currents j  are
hermitian, e.g. the hermitian conjugate of j 1(z) + j 0(z) is itself. this feature is dierent
in su(2) and this is why we can build a unitary representation with free elds in this
parametrization for sl(2, r). by contrast for su(2) , hermiticity and hence unitarity
is not straightforward in the wakimoto free eld representation and it requires certain
screening charges and singular states etc. to identify the unitary subset of states in the
hilbert space. none of these occur in sl(2, r) and hermiticity is manifest at every step in
the formulation given above. note that t++ (z) and the virasoro operators ln that follow
from it are also hermitian thanks to the hermiticity of the structure  i

z  (zp2) + 1

4z2 .

 the momentum zero mode p (and similarly p+ for right movers) contributes logarithmic
terms to the currents given above (22-24). in su(2) these zero modes are dropped to
insure that the currents are periodic for a string when    + 2. however for sl(2, r)
it is essential to retain the p (and p+) zero mode because otherwise the string cannot be
put on shell when it is excited as will be discussed now.

if the zero mode p is dropped then the currents are holomorphic as in usual ane current
algebra (they do not have logarithmic terms ln z and (ln z)2 contributed through the x in
(29)). we dene the ane currents as j (z) = [j  (z)]p=0 . these currents obey the standard
operator products expected from sl(2, r) currents. then the spectrum is given in the form
l0|p=0 =  1
k j (j + 1) + oscillators, a formula that is valid only for ane currents. comparing
to the expression of l0 above we learn that the ane current algebra is realized only in the
principal series

j (j + 1) = 

1
4  p2
2,

+ ip2.

(31)

j =

0 + p2

the discrete series or supplementary series do not occur in this realization of the ane current
algebra since for them j (j + 1) > 1/4.

however there is a physical problem if p = 0: since every term is positive in l0|p=0 it is
impossible to put the theory on shell by requiring l0|p=0 = a  1 (the additional spacelike
dimensions contribute only positive terms). this is why the p zero mode must be included
since p+p = p2
1 is the only negative term in the correct l0 and its presence enables
the theory to be put on-shell, as is also the case in at string theory. the presence of p is
completely natural as part of x in the wzw model, and there would be no issue if one treated
the model directly in terms of the free eld representation given above. however a non-zero
p alters certain standard ane current algebra results and therefore one must be careful in
trying to apply results obtained in ane current algebra to the sl(2, r) wzw string theory
as explained in the next paragraph and in the later sections of this paper. the early papers
until 1995 and some recent papers have overlooked this point. as we will see below it has
consequences for and adds renements to the ads-cft correspondence.

with a non-zero p the current algebra is not the usual ane current algebra since it includes
the logarithmic terms ln z and (ln z)2. in terms of the ane currents the correct sl(2, r) wzw
currents are given by [9] [10]

j 0(z) + j 1(z) = [j0(z) + j1(z)]
j 0(z)  j 1(z) = [j0(z)  j1(z)]  2ip ln z j2(z)

j 2(z) = j2(z)  ip ln z [j0(z) + j1(z)]

 k+2

z p + (ip ln z)2 [j0(z) + j1(z)]

despite the logarithms the wzw currents j  (z) have the correct operator products among
themselves and with the energy-momentum tensor as shown in detail in [9] [10]. the remaining
problem is the periodicity of the currents j  (zein2) = j  (z), which is not true in general, but
must be true at least in the physical sector of the theory. it was shown that this condition
imposes a quantization condition on the zero modes [9] [10]

p+p = r,

r  z+

(32)

where r is a positive integer or zero. therefore the physical states must come in sectors labeled
by r. the spectrum of the sl(2, r) wzw model may now be written as

l0 = r 

j (j + 1)

k

+ integer = a  1

(33)

where j = 1/2 + is (s is the eigenvalue of p2) labels the representation of the ane current
algebra j (z) and r comes purely through the extra zero mode p.
the independent canonical degrees of freedom are (cid:16) x + (z) , p  (z)(cid:17) and (cid:16) x2 (z) , p2 (z)(cid:17), and

the right moving currents jr = ikg1

r (gr) are quantized in a similar way. in this case

9

x (z) is expressed in terms of p 

x (z) =

q
k 

i

k z z

dz p (z) e x2(z)

while the currents are

j 1(z)  j 0(z) =  p (z)
j 1(z) + j 0(z) = : x + p  x + : +2 p2 x +  i (k + 2) z x +(z)

j2(z) =  : x + p  :  p2(z)

the spectrum of right movers is given by

l0 = p+ p +

k (cid:18)1

+ p2

2(cid:19) + oscillators

(34)

(35)

(36)

(37)

(38)

combining the left and right movers and using the conditions j = j and l0 = l0 we nd

p2 = p2 and

therefore physical states are constructed by applying oscillators to the base that is labeled by

p+ p = p+p = r,

r  z+ .

(39)

|base >= |p+, p, p2; p+, p, p2 >

(40)

with the relations and quantization conditions given above. the virasoro constraints are applied
to single out the physical states. the no ghost theorem was proven in [9] [10].

the procedure above establishes the physical spectrum of the string on ads3. the next

step is to construct vertex operators that correspond to these states.

3 vertex operator

vertex operators are constructed by starting with the tachyon vertex operator, which is the
group element

v (g) = eit+

eit2ei+t

= v (gl) v (gr)

furthermore, v (gl) and v (gr) are constructed from free elds

v (gl) = eixt+

eix2t2eix+t,

v (gr) = ei xt+

ei x2t2ei x+t

(41)

(42)

(43)

the representation of the generators t should correspond to the physical states determined
above (as opposed to the non-unitary j = 1/2 representation of footnote 1). we need to take
into account the eect of the zero mode p in the representation t so that there is operator-state
correspondence. the relevant representation will be discussed in the next subsection.

10

in the quantum theory the expressions for v (gl,r) must be normal ordered appropriately
so that their operator products with the currents and stress tensor give the correct results for
the single and double poles. an additional desirable property is that the ads vertex operators
should tend to the at 3d string vertex operators exp (ikx  (z, z)) since the large k limit
is smooth for the complete theory as we have already discussed. we have accomplished all
of these properties as described below. using this construction in principle one can perform
computations of correlation functions using free elds.

for semi-classical arguments used in the interpretation of the model, it is also useful to
express the ads coordinates  (z, z), + (z, z),  (z, z) themselves in terms of the free elds. if
we ignore orders of operators in a semi-classical approach, we can obtain the result by computing
v (gl) v (gr) in the j = 1/2 representation. thus, using (19, 16) and (26, 34) we obtain

 (z, z) = x2 (z) + x2 (z) + 2 ln(cid:16)1 + x + (z) x (z)(cid:17)

 (z, z) = x (z) +

+ (z, z) = x + (z) +

ex2(z) x (z)

1 + x + (z) x (z)

e x2(z)x + (z)

1 + x + (z) x (z)

where x + (z) , x (z) are given by (20) and (21)

x + (z) =

x (z) =

(47)

(48)

we will use these expressions below to discuss windings at the ads boundary   .

3.1 position-momentum basis and state-operator correspondence

the following is an operator representation of the sl(2, r) generators t that correspond to the
physical states determined in the previous section. they should be inserted into the expression
of the vertex operators given in (41-43)

t+  p+
t2  1
2 (x p+ + p+ x) + s
t  x p+ x  2sx  kr

 x+ p x+ + 2sx+  kr
p
  1
2 (x+ p + p x+) + s
p+  p

(49)

these forms may look familiar except for the terms that contain kr. the integer r corresponds
to the quantum label of the state (40) as determined by the monodromy argument (39), and k
is the central extension of the current algebra. the operators (x, p+) form a canonical pair.
these x, p+ operators are just a convenient device, they are not the zero modes of the elds

11

x, p + etc. similarly the pair (x+, p) is canonical, but it is not independent of the pair
(x, p+). the relationship between these pairs is non-linear and is given by the two forms of
the generators above.

by using the canonical commutation rules [x, p+] = [x, p+] = i it is easy to see that either
form of the operators t satisfy the same commutation rules as the 22 matrix representation
of footnote 1. furthermore the t are manifestly hermitian thus insuring that they correspond
to a unitary representation (unlike the t of footnote 1). the casimir operator for either form
of t is

1

c2 = 

2 (cid:16)t+t + tt+(cid:17)  t2

2

= kr 

1
4  s2

(50)

(51)

k

(the corresponding casimir eigenvalue for the t of footnote 1 is c2 = 3/4). observe that
 1
given in (28). we will see that the operator product of the energy-momentum tensor with the
vertex operator gives

4 + s2(cid:17) is the same as the formula for the spectrum of a physical state as

k (cid:16) 1
c2 = r + 1

t (z) v r,s (z) 

k (cid:16) 1
r + 1
(z  w)2
k (cid:18)1
1
4

4 + s2(cid:17)
+ s2(cid:19)

r,s = r +

v r,s (z) +

v r,s (z)
(z  w)

(52)

(53)

where r,s is the conformal dimension. this identies t given above as the representation
that provides the desired state-operator correspondence. note that the contribution of the zero
modes are taken into account through the term kr. without the kr term one cannot construct
primary vertex operators of the form : j v r,s : (needed for the ads-cft correspondence) with
total conformal weight 1, since this requires r,s = 0.

there is here the possibility for some confusion about this representation and we would like

to comment on it. of course we may dene a  through

c2 = kr 

1
4  s2 =  ( + 1)

(54)

and note that we must have  ( + 1) > 0 to be able to satisfy the mass shell condition. this
identies the t in the discrete series representation. how is this possible since we made the
point that only the principal series representation for the ane currents is allowed? the answer
is that the t takes into account the contribution of the zero mode while the ane currents
continue to be in the principal series. that is, the full current algebra module, including the
string excitations, is in the principal series, which is a very dierent module than the discrete
series module. when this is combined with the zero mode, the wzw vertex operators have
the representation that corresponds to t. but this does not change the ane current algebra

12

module from being in the principal series. this shows that the eects of the zero modes are
subtle, as we will continue to witness further in the following sections.

the group theoretical states for sl(2, r) are usually labeled as |jm > where m is the
eigenvalue of the compact generator t0. one may consider states in which other operators are
diagonal. for our purposes it is useful to diagonalize t+ or t. when t+ is diagonal in the basis
< s, p+|, it corresponds to diagonalizing the operator p+ and when t is diagonal in the basis
|s, p >, it corresponds to diagonalizing the operator p. the fourier transform of these states
correspond to diagonalizing the operators x or x+ in the basis < s, x| or |s, x+ >, respectively.
in position space we have < s, x|p+ = i < s, x| and p|s, x+ >= i+|s, x+ > consistent
with the commutation rules.

one may evaluate the matrix elements of the vertex operators (41-43) in the position or
momentum basis in the same way that one would compute the group elements in the |jm >
basis dj
mm (g). in particular we nd it convenient to use the momentum basis or the position
basis as follows

p+,p (g) = < p+|eit+
v r,s
x,x+ (g) = < x|eit+
v r,s

eit2ei+t|p >
eit2ei+t|x+ >

(55)

(56)

and similarly for the left/right vertex operators. note that in momentum basis t+ is diagonal
on the bra and the t is diagonal on the ket, showing that this form is already fairly close to the
vertex operator of a at string. we will see that these labels p or x have the interpretation
of momenta or positions at the boundary of ads3. the position basis will be useful to connect
to the discussions in the recent literature and show the renements that need to be made. the
momentum basis will be useful for establishing the operator product (52) at the fully quantum
level (ordering of operators taken into account) and for discussing the at limit as k  . our
new vertex operators has the desirable properties.

3.2 vertex operator in position basis

the vertex operator in position space is dened by

x,x+ (g) = < x|eit+
v r,s

eit2ei+t|x+ >

= < (cid:16)x + (cid:17)|eit2|(cid:16)x+  +(cid:17) >
= < e(cid:16)x + (cid:17)|(cid:16)x+  +(cid:17) > ei(si/2)
= < (cid:16)x + (cid:17)|e(cid:16)x+  +(cid:17) > ei(si/2)

(57)

(58)

(59)

(60)

where we have used that t+ = p+ and t = p are translation operators on x space, and
t2 is a dilation operator on x space (except for the extra factor ei(si/2)).
if we dene

13

fr,s (xx+) < x|x+ > then we must have a function of only the product xx+ on account of
its properties under dilations. then the full vertex is

v r,s

x,x+ (g) = ei(si/2)fr,s(cid:16)e(cid:16)x+  +(cid:17)(cid:16)x + (cid:17)(cid:17) .

(61)

to nd fr,s (xx+) sandwich t and use its action on the right and left states to obtain the
dierential equation

< x|t|x+ >= i+fr,s
= ix(cid:16)xfr,s(cid:17)  2sxfr,s 

kr
i

fr,s

(62)

(63)

at r = 0 the this rst order dierential equation has the unique solution f0,s = q 1

and the full vertex operator at r = 0 becomes

 (x+x + 1)12is,

v 0,s

x,x+ (g) = s 1

 (cid:16)e/2(cid:16)x+  +(cid:17)(cid:16)x + (cid:17) + e/2(cid:17)12is

.

(64)

at non-zero values of r we apply i on both sides to obtain the second order dierential
equation

 (cid:16)x(cid:16)xfr,s(cid:17)(cid:17)  2is(cid:16)xfr,s(cid:17) + krfr,s + +fr,s = 0

(65)

this becomes the hypergeometric equation in one variable. the exact solution that is well
behaved at innity is

fr,s(cid:16)xx+(cid:17) =
 

(1 + xx+)12is
 (xx+)is
kr  s2

2f1(cid:18)  is,   is; 1 + 2; 1

xx+(cid:19) ,

(66)

(67)

xx+(cid:17) = 1, and the solution reduces to
when r = 0, we get  = is and 2f1(cid:16)0, 0; 1 + 2is; 1
v 0,s
x,x+ (g) given above. for general r, with kr > s2 that satises the mass shell condition for
excited strings, the vertex operator becomes

v r,s

x,x+ (g) = s 1

 (cid:16)e/2(cid:16)x+  +(cid:17)(cid:16)x + (cid:17) + e/2(cid:17)12is
(x++)(x+)e(cid:17)
2f1(cid:16)  is,   is; 1 + 2;

1
((x+  +) (x + ) e)is





(68)

we see that the zero mode modies the vertex operator by the factor in the second line. the
conformal weight of this vertex operator is

r,s = r +

1

k (cid:18) 1

4

+ s2(cid:19)

(69)

as in (52) which will be proven below at the full quantum level.

14

the factor in the second line of (68) has been missed in recent discussions of the ads-cft
correspondence. the vertex operator used in recent literature either is not unitary [13]-[15], or
as in [19] corresponds to only the rst line of (68), which is the vertex operator at r = 0. as
already emphasized several times, with r = 0 the mass shell condition, or the primary operator
condition (withr,s  0) could not be satised and therefore the state-operator correspondence
and/or unitarity would be lost. our new vertex operator has the desirable properties of unitarity
and state-operator correspondence.

3.2.1 vertex operator near the ads3 boundary

the behavior of the correct vertex operator near the ads boundary    can now be
examined. as it turns out the important quantity is not the vertex operator, which is the
wavefunction, but rather the probability that involves the absolute value square

r,s

x,x+ (g) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

v r,s

x,x+ (g)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
noting that 2f1 (a, b; c; 0) = 1, we see that as long as (x+  +) (x + ) 6= 0, the vertex
x,x+ (g)  exp(cid:16)(cid:16)1 + 2kr  s2(cid:17)(cid:17), in-
operator falls o as exp(cid:16)(cid:16) 1
dicating that this wavefunction is normalizable. when (x+  +) (x + )  0 the rst factor
behaves like a delta function as   , while the second factor modies it mildly with loga-
rithms

2 + kr  s2(cid:17)(cid:17) , or r,s

(70)

r,s

x,x+  (cid:16)x+ + +(cid:17) (cid:16)x  (cid:17) hc1 ln(cid:16)x+  +(cid:17)(cid:16)x + (cid:17) + c1 + c2i2

(71)

where c1,2 are independent of (x+  +), (x + ). in ariving at this result we have used the
small z  0 behavior of the hypergeometric function

z (cid:17)
2f1(cid:16)  is,   is; 1 + 2; 1

zis



 (1 + 2)  ln z

 (  is)  (1 +  + is)

+ c2 (, s)

(72)

note that at r = 0 the coecients c1 = 0 and c2 = 1. when r 6= 0 the term c1 + c2 is neglected
as compared to the rst term in c1 ln (x+  +) (x + ) + (c1 + c2). so we see that the
support of the probability at the boundary of ads    is precisely at

+ (z, z) = x+,

 (z, z) = x

(73)

therefore, the labels x must be interpreted as the coordinates at the boundary of the ads
space [14], [19].

3.2.2 windings at the ads boundary

to examine further the properties of the string theory near the boundary at   , in
particular its zero modes, we take the center of mass positions of x2, x2 to innity. that is,

15

use x2 (z) = q2 +    and x2 (z) = q2 +    , and let q2 = q + q and q2 = q  q and then let
q  . then note that  (z, z) given in (45,46) become purely left or right moving in this
limit

 (z, z)  x (z) ,

+ (z, z)  x + (z) .

(74)

then using the minkowski signature on the worldsheet replace z  exp (i ( + )) and z 
exp (i (  ))

x ( + ) = q + p ( + ) + oscillators, p + (z) = p+ + oscl.,
p  (z) = p + oscl.,
x + (  ) = q+ + p+ (  ) + oscillators,

(75)

(76)

and examine the periodicity of the ads string as    + 2. the oscillator part is periodic;
for full periodicity we must make a periodic lattice in q space with lattice size r and identify
points on this lattice

q  q + 2p,

p = nr

(77)

then the canonical conjugate p+ = m/r must be quantized in units of 1/r. thus, we learn
that the string winds n times and that p is quantized in terms of winding number n while p+
is quantized in terms of the kaluza-klein quantum number m, and similarly for p, p+

p = nr,

p+ =

m
r

,

p+ = nr,

p =

m
r

,

(78)

this observation is related to the winding of the long strings discussed in [13], [15], [24], so we
can identify the winding numbers

n = i d



,

n = i d+
+ .

(79)

now we can compute the products p+p, p+p that appear in the spectrum (39) and establish
the following relation between these integers

mn = mn = r,

r  z+

(80)

thus, the winding of the long strings on the boundary as discussed in [13], [15], [24] demands
that p = nr be non-zero. of course, this is in agreement with the requirements of on shell
and monodromy [9][10] we emphasized above. we now see that the eect of the zero mode p
must be included in the vertex operator if it is to describe a string that has non-trivial windings
in ads space.

3.3 vertex operator in momentum basis

we will now take advantage of the factorized form of the vertex operator. the full vertex
operator is

v r,s
p+,p (z, z) = < p+|v (gl) v (gr)|p >

(81)

16

= z dp < p+|v (gl)|p >< p|v (gr) |p >
= z dp v r,s

p+,p (z) v r,s

p,p (z)

(82)

(83)

in this section we are going to describe only the left moving part of the factorized vertex
operator in the momentum basis v r,s
p+,p (z) and verify that it has the correct operator product
properties with the left moving currents and the stress tensor. the right moving factor of the
factorized vertex operator v r,s
p,p (z) is insensitive to these operator products and therefore we
do not include it in the discussion. to discuss operator products for right movers we insert the

intermediate states 1 = r dp+ |p+ >< p+| and then the discussion for right movers parallels
the discussion for left movers. after dening the left moving vertex operator v r,s
p+,p (z) at the
fully quantum level (ordering of operators taken into account) we are going to show that it
has correct quantum operator products with the currents and that it has the desired conformal
dimension

r,s = r +

1

k (cid:18)1

+ s2(cid:19) .

4

3.3.1 classical expression

the left moving part of the vertex operator in momentum space is dened by

p+,p (gl (z)) = < s, p+|eixt+
v r,s

= eixp+
= eixp+
= eixp+

eix2t2eix+t|s, p >
< s, p+|eix2t2|s, p > eix+p
e 1
e 1

2 x2(12is) < s, ex2p+|s, p > eix+p
2 x2(12is) < s, p+|s, ex2p > eix+p

(84)

(85)

(86)

(87)

where we have used the fact that t+ is diagonal on < s, p+| and t is diagonal on |s, p > and
that the operator t2 is the dilation operator on functions of p except for the additional overall
phase. if we dene the function fr,s (p+p) =< s, p+|s, p > then we must have a function of
the single variable p+p on account of its properties under dilations. then the vertex operator
is

p+,p (z) = eixp+
v r,s

(88)
to nd the function fr,s we sandwich < s, p+|t|s, p > and derive a dierential equation by
operating on both sides

e 1
2 x2(12is) fr,s(cid:16)ex2pp+(cid:17) eix+p

 p  p + 2is +

kr

p! fr,s(p+, p) = 0.

by multiplying through with p this becomes a single equation in one variable  = p+p

(cid:16)  ()2 + 2is () + kr(cid:17) fr,s() = 0

17

(89)

(90)

the solution is given in terms of a bessel function

fr,s() = is j2(cid:16)2(cid:17) ,

 = kr  s2.

(91)

therefore the middle factor in the vertex operator is obtained by rescaling  with the factor
ex2. the result is

p+,p (z) = ceixp+
v r,s

e 1

2 x2 j2(cid:18)2qp+pe 1

2 x2(z)(cid:19) eix+p

(92)

where s, p have been absorbed into an overall factor c (r, s, p) = c(s, r)  (p+p)is.

3.3.2 quantum ordering and operator products

at the full quantum level (with an ordering of the operators that will be given below) the
correct operator products with the currents are given as

j (z)  v r,s

p+p(w) =

1

z  w

< s, p+|tv r,s(w)|s, p >

(93)

where  is +, or 2. the action of t on the bra is a dierential operator that follows from the
left side of (49). thus, t+ = p+, t2=dilations, etc. in addition to getting the correct operator
products with the currents we will also see that the dimension of the vertex operator v r,s
p+p(w)
k (cid:16) 1
is r,s = r + 1

to dene the vertex operator at the quantum level, we begin by preserving the order of
the factors due to the group theoretical origin of their order, and then apply normal ordering
within each factor as follows

4 + s2(cid:17).

p+p(z) = eix(z)p+
v r,s

< s, p+|(cid:16): eix2(z)t2 :(cid:17)|s, p >  : e

ip(cid:16) i
kr z

dzp +(z) :ex2(z):(cid:17) :!

(94)

where x + has been written in terms of canonical variables. the leftmost factor does not need
normal ordering (see denition of canonical variables). this already provides the order of oper-
ators. the next step is a reordering of operators (and picking up factors due to the reordering)
for the purpose of performing computations. a methodical approach for the computation of op-
erator products is the use of wicks theorem for free elds. this requires fully normal ordered
expressions. for this purpose we need to reorder the operators above to rewrite the vertex
operator in fully normal ordered form. this reordering gives the following expression

p+p(z) = : eix(z)p+
v r,s
pr z

 e

zz(cid:17):ex2(z):( zz

|s, p >:

< s, p+|eix2(z)t2
k(cid:16)p +(z)+ p+

dz 1

note that now the whole expression is sandwiched within the normal ordering columns, and this
is what produces the complicated additional factors. in computations it will be convenient to

18

further rewrite it by expanding the last exponential as a series and then evaluating the matrix
elements at the end

which is nite.

later we will be interested in taking the large k limit to show that we can recover the vertex
operator in at 3d. in this limit our nite normal ordered vertex operator will be the same as
the nite normal ordered vertex operator in at minkowski space-time.

the technical details of the calculation of the operator products of the currents and stress
tensor with the vertex operator are given in the appendix. we nd the correct operator products
(93). we also show that the operator product of the vertex operator with the energy-momentum
tensor gives the correct conformal dimension as in (50,52)

therefore, we get the at theory in this limit. we do the same with the free eld formulation
of the currents, rescale the free elds, and then identify the at free elds as the limit of the
rescaled free elds.

as k   the expressions in parentheses on both sides are kept xed. therefore, due to the
1k+2 some terms vanish. now we identify the at string coordinates x  and
extra factors of
their conjugate momenta p  in the large k limit

  j 
k + 2! = p 

(103)

as the expressions inside parentheses that remain xed (using p  = ( p 1  p 0) and x =
2( x 1  x 0) ), then in the large k limit we identify
(cid:16) p2k+2(cid:17) = p 2,
(cid:16)k + 2x2(cid:17) = x2,

(cid:16) p +
k+2(cid:17) = p +,
(cid:16)k + 2x +(cid:17) = x +,

iz(cid:16)k + 2x(cid:17) = p 

(cid:16)k + 2x(cid:17) = x.

(104)

the fundamental canonical pairs are (cid:16) x, p +(cid:17) and (cid:16) x 2, p 2 = i x 2(cid:17) , which are written in

terms of the elementary oscillators (rescaled ones +,,2
the oscillators in p +, since p + = i x + in the large k limit according to (26).

). note that x + is derived in terms of

in terms of the rescaled variables x , p  = iz x  , the operator products in the large k
limit become simple for x + as well, so that we have the operator products of the usual at

3.4.2 vertex operator in the at limit

we want to show that the asymptotic form of the vertex operator as k   matches the at
form. for this we need to replace p+ = k p+ and p = k p so that in the limit the factors

exp(cid:16)ipx(cid:17)  exp(cid:16)ip x(cid:17)

come out right. similarly we dene s = k p2 so that exp (isx2)  exp(cid:16)ip2 x2(cid:17). replacing

the rescaled variables in (88) and taking the large k limit we nd that the at vertex operator
emerges

(106)

(107)

the overall eld independent constant f r,s (k p+ p) = (k p+ p)ik p2 j2mk(cid:16)2k p+ p(cid:17), is
given in terms of the bessel function where we have dened the mass m through  = km, or

m = qr  p2

2 = qp+ p  p2

2

(108)

to evaluate the large k limit of f r,s (k p+ p) we nd it useful to examine the large k limit of
the dierential equation in (90). after rescaling s = k p2 and  = k, and taking the large
k limit we learn from the leading term that f r,s behaves like a delta function. after using the
denition of mass given in (108) we obtain

f r,s  c(cid:16)p+ p + p2

2 + m2(cid:17)

(109)

where c is a constant. note that this is the mass shell condition for a at string. if we substitute
this in the vertex operator, then in the k   limit we get (up to a constant phase)

(cid:16)v r,s
p+p(z)(cid:17)k

= ei x p+

ei x2 p2

ei x+ p(cid:16)p+ p + p2

2 + m2(cid:17)

(110)

which is the correct vertex operator in at 3d-minkowski space-time, with the mass shell
condition imposed.

4 ads-cft correspondence and unitarity

4.1 boundary operators and principal series

we now discuss the implications of our results for the proposed structure of the boundary con-
formal eld theory (cft) which is claimed to provide a non-perturbative and second-quantized
forumulation of string theory on ads3  s3  m 4 [13], [14], [15]. we follow closely the proposal
of [13], as discussed in more detail in [14] and as recently presented in [15]. we particularly em-
phasize the issues of unitarity and operator-state correspondence, and therefore we are forced
to re-examine the proposal of [13] in view of the only allowed unitary representation discussed

21

above, that is - the principal series representation of the ane current algebra supplemented
by the zero modes. we show that the proposal of [13] has to be generalized and modied to
include the eect of the zero modes, while working in the unitary principal series representation
of the ane current algebra. the vertex operator v r,s
x,x+ (g) discussed in the previous section
of this paper plays a crucial role in the following construction.

first we briey summarize the proposal of [13] in order to make our presentation more
convenient for the reader. we follow the notation of [15]. let the world-sheet currents ka(z) of
some world-sheet current algebra satisfy the following opes

ka(z)kb(w) 

1
2

kgab

(z  w)2 +

f abckc(w)
(z  w)

,

(111)

where kg denotes the level of the world-sheet ane lie algebra g and f abc are the structure
constants of the corresponding lie group g. let the corresponding space-time currents be
denoted by k a(x). they are expected to satisfy the analogous opes

f abck c(y)
(x  y)
g stands for the level of the space-time current algebra.

k a(x)k b(y) 

k(st)
g ab
(x  y)2 +

1
2

where k(st)

,

(112)

the proposed form for k a(x) is dictated by symmetry and the fact that k a(x) is a (1, 0)
operator in space-time. following the proposal of [13] [15] we present a generalized form of
the space-time current k a while insisting on the only unitary representation and taking into
account the contribution of the zero modes

1

k a(x) = 

k z d2z ka(z) j(x+; z) r,s
x,x+(z, z) is dened as in subsection (3.2.1), which we

x,x+(z, z),

(113)

where, the probability distribution r,s
repeat here for convenience

r,s

x,x+ (z, z) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

v r,s

x,x+ (g)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2

.

(114)

this may be interpreted as dressing each worldsheet operator with a vertex operator that
corresponds to a physical state in the theory. thus ka(z)v r,s (z, z) and j (x+; z) (v r,s (z, z))
are both dressed. we dier here from [13] [15] only by inserting r,s
x,x+ (z, z) instead of a
single v r,s
x,x+ (g). we note that we must take the worldsheet conformal dimension r,s = 0,
which is possible provided the zero modes p, p+ contribute a non-zero r. the explicit form of
the vertex operator v r,s
x,x+(g (z, z)) and its dimension r,s was derived and discussed in detail
in the previous section. furthermore, j is dened to be, as in [9] [15]

j(x; z)  2xj 2(z)  (j 1(z)  j 0(z)) (cid:16)x(cid:17)2

(j 1(z)  j 0(z)).

(115)

note that the expression for the space-time current k a(x) given in [15] formally corresponds
to the form of the probability distribution at r = 0 with

0,s

x,x+ (g) =

1

 (cid:16)e/2(cid:16)x+  +(cid:17)(cid:16)x + (cid:17) + e/2(cid:17)2

(116)

22

denoted as 1(x, x; z, z) in [15], albeit evaluated in the non-existent discrete series represen-
tation, which is also not consistent with unitarity. in our case there is operator-state corre-
spondence as well as unitarity. in the next section we will briey discuss the opes of these
space-time currents k a and compare to the results of [15].

we can easily extend our discussion and consider the generators of the space-time virasoro
symmetry. the form of the space-time stress tensor t (x) is also dictated by symmetry and
the fact that t (x) should be a (2, 0) operator in space-time. again, we generalize the proposal
presented in [13] [15], and present formulae valid for the unitary principal series representation
of the ane current algebra supplemented with zero modes

t (x) =

1

2k z d2z(cid:16)xj(x; z)xr,s

x,x+ (g) + 22

xj(x; z)r,s

x,x+ (g)(cid:17) j(x+; z).

(117)

as before, the expression given in [15] is formally the special case of this formula at r = 0,
however, evaluated in the discrete series representation which is not consistent with unitarity.
in our version unitarity and operator-state correspondence is preserved. the corresponding
ope

in principle determines the value of the central charge of the boundary conformal eld theory
cst. this value should be compared to the classical expression for the central charge of the
virasoro algebra at the boundary of ads3 found in the framework of pure three-dimensional
quantum gravity [26]. in the next section we will briey discuss the opes of the space-time
stress tensor t (x) and compare to the results of [15].

4.2 operator products

in this section we want to discuss the opes of the space-time currents k a(x) in the space-time
current algebra and the opes of the space-time stress tensor t (x) in the space-time virasoro
algebra, given the general expressions for k a(x) and t (x) presented above.

in principle, the relevant opes should be evaluated for all values of the eld  (z, z). to
accomplish this it seems necessary to use the general opes of two vertex operators v r,s
x,x+(g).
these expressions can be evaluated using free eld representation discussed in this paper. the
corresponding analytically continued expression (relevant for the sl(2, c)/su(2) wzw model)
have been presented by teschner [19], [20], however only at r = 0. the general form of the
x,x+(g)v r,s
v r,s
x,x+(g) turns out to be rather complicated, even at r = 0, as in can be seen from
[19], [20]. however, provided one takes the limit   , which corresponds to the boundary of
ads3, the corresponding semiclassical expression for the opes of two vertex operators v r,s
x,x+(g)
simplify considerably.

in particular, we have already seen that for   
x,x+(g)  (x+  +)(x  )(cid:16)hc1 log((x+  +)(x  )) + c1 + c2i(cid:17)2
r,s

,

(119)

23

where c1 = 0, c2 = 1 if r = 0, and c1 + c2 is dropped if r 6= 0. when r = 0 only the
delta function survives in this limit. from this expression it follows that j1  0,s1
(g) and
x1 ,x+
vj2  v 0,s2
(g) satisfy (with j1,2 = 1/2 + is1,2, as implied by the unitary principal series

representation)

which is dierent than [15]. note that these expressions are obviously consistent with the fact
that we are working in the principal series representation j = 1/2 + is which closes under
operator products. these expressions can be used as a semiclassical limit of the complicated
ope involving probability distributions 0,s
x,x+(g) at r = 0. notice
that the analogous expressions used in [15] (eqs. (2.34) and (2.35) of [15]) are not consistent
with the closure in the principal series representation.

x,x+(g) or vertex operators v 0,s

nevertheless, we use the semiclassical reasoning of [15], to argue that the space-time currents
k a(x) and the space-time stress tensor t (x) dened above satisfy the opes expected from the
space-time current algebra and the virasoro algebra respectively. however, it should be noted
that the    asymptotics of the general vertex operator v r,s
x,x+(g) involves, apart from the
delta function, a log piece as well, so that the general formula for the semiclassical limit of the
ope of two vertex operators is not as simple as the r = 0 case, and the semiclassical analysis
along the lines of [15] becomes more involved. these renements are still to be worked out (in
principle, by using our free elds), but it is likely that the exact formulas at r 6= 0 and general
 will be similar.

with the caviats above in mind, following the same steps presented in [15] one sees that

k a(x)k b(y) 

1
2

ik(st)
g ab
(x  y)2 +

f abck c(y)
(x  y)

,

where in our case the operator i (in the notation of [15]) is dened as

i 

1

k2 z d2zj(x; z) j (x; z)r,s

x,x+(g).

(123)

(124)

the analogous formula given in [15] is formally once again a special case of this expression for
r = 0. however, we emphasize that in general (i.e. when r 6= 0) it is much harder to argue (as
done in [15]) that the value of the expectation value of the operator i corresponds precisely to

24

the value of the central charge expected from the classical analysis of [26]. similar observation
are valid for the opes of the space-time stress tensor t (x).

we conclude this section with the following remark: in many papers on ads3/cf t2 cor-
respondence [13] [14] [15] it is claimed that the highest weight j of sl(2, r) is related to the
spacetime virasoro highest weight h (because the global sl(2, r) symmetry of the bulk ads3
corresponds to the global conformal symmetry of the boundary cf t2 generated by l0 and l
[25]), and since h is supposedly a conformal weight of the boundary cf t2, j has to be real,
forcing one to consider the non-unitary discrete series representation.

however, if h were indeed a conformal weight of the boundary cft, it should be an eigen-
value of the spacetime l0. nevertheless, given the explicit expressions for l0 and the vertex
operator, used in [13] [14] [15] (for example, equations (2.5), (2.7) and (7.13) of [15]) one can
explicitly check that this is not the case. hence, j is quite happy to be complex.

we therefore think that the right interpretation of j consistent with the unitary principal
series representation, supplemented with zero modes, is the one already given in the second
part of this paper. thus, various problems associated with alleged non-unitarity and failure
of operator-state correspondence for the case of string theory on ads3, as discussed in many
papers in the literature, simply do not exist. however, to establish the ads3-cft conjecture
the renements discussed in this paper for the vertex operator need to be implemented more
rigorously.

5 conclusions

to summarize, in this paper we have discussed string theory on ads3s3m 4 while emphasiz-
ing the issues of unitarity and state-operator correspondence. in particular we have re-examined
the ads3-cf t2 correspondence in the minkowski signature, by taking into account the only al-
lowed unitary representation, the principal series of sl(2,r) supplemented with the zero modes.
the zero modes play an important role in the description of on-shell. without them a unitary
formulation of the on-shell theory is not possible. also, the zero modes describe the winding of
long strings around the ads3 boundary. the theory is presented as part of the supersymmetric
wzw model that includes the supergroup su(2/1, 1) (or osp(4/2) or d (2, 1; )) with central
extension k. a free eld representation is given and the vertex operators are constructed in
terms of free elds in sl(2,r) principal series representation bases that are labeled by position
space or momentum space at the boundary of ads3. our vertex operator includes factors that
have been missed in the recent literature on the ads3/cf t2 correspondence. we have shown
explicitly that our vertex operator has the correct operator products with the currents and
stress tensor, all of which are constructed from free elds. we have also shown that in the
limit when ads3 tends to at 3d-minkowski space ( k  ), the ads3 vertex operators in
momentum space tend to the vertex operators of at 3d-string theory (and furthermore the

25

theory readjusts smoothly in the rest of the dimensions in the same limit).

there remains to compute in strictly string theoretical language the various correlation
functions or operator products that would verify or rene the ads-cft correspondence. in
principle our free eld vertex operators can be used to compute any correlation function. we
intend to discuss these computations in the future.

a appendix: operator products

in this appendix we are going to describe in detail the full quantum treatment of the operator
products of the vertex operator with currents and energy-momentum tensor. this calculation
is done using the same notation as in [9] which we keep here so that we can use previous
results. therefore one should be careful about the following relations between the notation in
this appendix and the notation in the previous sections of this paper:

previous sections : x(z), x2(z), x +(z)
k u(z), x +(z)

appendix : x(z),  2

(125)

in the rst subsection of the appendix we are going to describe the quantum ordered ex-
pression for the 22 group element (j = 1/2 representation) and discuss its operator product
with the energy-momentum tensor. besides serving to double check the result that follows
from products with currents j  (z) g ()  tg () / (z  w) [9], this calculation is also useful
to clarify some delicate points of the calculation in more general representations j.
in the
second subsection we are going to discuss operator products of the full vertex operator with
the currents and also nd the conformal dimension of the vertex operator as stated in (52).

the method of computation is based on wicks theorem for free elds. the expressions for
contractions between free elds which will be used in the following computations are as follows

< x(z) p +(w) > i
< p +(z) x(w) > i

2w + i
2z + i

2 (cid:16) i
zw(cid:17)
zw , < u(z) s(w) > k
2w + i
2 ln(cid:16) zwzw(cid:17) .
zw , < u(z) u(w) >  k

(126)

(127)

the terms of the form i
2z arise from the careful ordering of zero modes such that hermiticity
is respected at every step [9]. the denition of the contraction includes this eect of the zero
modes.

a.1 operator products with the group element

we have the quantum operator version of the left moving group element gmn , as in (20) modulo

the orders of the operators are important in these expressions. this order of operators is
dictated by the orders of the matrices that make up g. this order will also be respected in more
general representations. then these gmn are not fully normal ordered (recall that the dependent
operator x + given in (26) contains p + and : e2u(w)/k : ). in order to do the calculations of
operator products by using wicks theorem, rst we should rewrite each gmn in normal ordered
form, by keeping all the terms that arise from re-ordering the operators, as follows

in this expression the rst term (161) gives the term in (148), the terms (162,163) combined
cancel the result of the term in (151), likewise the fourth term (164) cancels the result of the
term in (152). finally the last term (165) gives a nite result combined with the term in (157).
the calculation of the operator product t (z) g22(w) is similar to the above calculation.
since in the integrand there are extra w dependent functions, one will see their w-derivatives
appear in the operator product expansion. the double contraction : i < p +(z)x(w) ><
zx(z)p +(w) >: gives the term coming from the w-derivative of 1/(w w). other than this,
the contraction :< p +(z)x(w) > izx(z)p +(w) : gives the term that contains wx(w).
: one nds that it is equal to 1/ (4k), but
not 3/ (4k). however, one should be careful about a special term coming from the double

the term (170) comes from the derivative of g22(w). the term (171) is the term that we were
looking for to obtain the correct conformal weight 3/ (4k). changing : e
:  :
e u(w)
: does not change its conformal dimension. adding its conformal dimension, 1/4k, to
the coecient of the term in (171) we again nd 3/4k. therefore the operator product of
g22(w) with t (z) dictates that the quantum theory be written in the normal ordered form form

a.2 operator products with the vertex operator

in order to simplify the expressions of the operator products we are going to use the expression
(95) for the vertex operator, which we write again for convenience in the form

v r,s
p+p(w) =: f (w) < jp+|g(w)h(w)|jp >:

where

k

f (w) = eix(w)p+

in the following expressions we will often have p+g(w). even though in the above expression
g(w) seem not to contain p+ explicitly, one sees p+ dependence after calculating its matrix
element between the states < s, p+| and |s, p > (92). keeping this in mind, we will also often
omit the states < s, p+| and |s, p > in most of the following expressions for simplicity, but
their presence is implied.

in the case of operator product of j + with the vertex operator there is only one contraction

j +(z)  v r,s

p+p(w)  :< p +f > gh : = 

v r,s
p+p(w)

p+
z  w

= 

1

z  w

< s, p+|t+v(w)|s, p >

for the operator product of j2 with the vertex operator we need to calculate the following
contractions

j2(z)  v r,s

p+p(w)  : x < p +f > gh : + :< p +f > g < xh >:

+ : f < p2g > h : + : f g < j2(z)h >:

these contractions give the following results:

contains the following contractions:

the second term above cancels the term in (226) and the last term cancels (223). combining
the third and the fourth terms with the terms of (229,231) one gets nite terms. therefore,
after all the calculations done so far we obtained all the terms in t  v r,s
p+p (209-214), except
(zw)2 < t+tv(w) > piece and the term (211) and the only remaining term coming from
the
the contractions is the rst term in (234). this term can be written as

in writing this expression we used the relation (183). the combination of rst two terms in
(235) gives the term (211). whereas the last term in (235) can be written as

1/k

(z  w)2 < s, p+|p+f (w)(cid:18): ei 2u(w)

k

changing p+ to t+ and p to t, and then moving t past t2 (197) one gets

(z  w)2 < s, p+|

this is the last piece needed in the operator product of the vertex operator with the energy-
momentum tensor (209-214).

this computation proves that we have constructed the correct vertex operator at the quan-

tum level.
