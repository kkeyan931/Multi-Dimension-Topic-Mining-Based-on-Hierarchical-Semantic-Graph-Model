abstract

the riemannian geometry of coset spaces is reviewed, with emphasis on
its applications to supergravity and m -theory compactications. formulae
for the connection and curvature of rescaled coset manifolds are generalized
to the case of nondiagonal killing metrics.

the example of the n 010 spaces is discussed in detail. these are a subclass
of the coset manifolds n pqr = g/h = su (3)u (1)/u (1)u (1), the integers
p, q, r characterizing the embedding of h in g. we study the realization of
n 010 as g/h = su (3)  su (2)/u (1)  su (2) (with diagonal embedding of
the su (2)  h into g). for a particular g-symmetric rescaling there exist
three killing spinors, implying n = 3 supersymmetry in the ads4  n 010
compactication of d = 11 supergravity. this rescaled n 010 space is of
particular interest for the ads4/cf t3 correspondence, and its su (3)su (2)
isometric realization is essential for the osp(4|3) classication of the kaluza-
klein modes.

1 introduction

coset manifolds are a natural generalization of group manifolds, and play an im-
portant role in supergravity and superstring compactications, and in the recent
ads/cft correspondences [1]. indeed several of these correspondences have been
investigated in the context of compactications of supergravity theories on anti-de
sitter spaces times internal coset spaces g/h. many results of the 80s have
been reinterpreted and extended in the ads/cft framework, which has prompted
in particular a renewed interest in kaluza-klein mass spectra of the ads  g/h
supergravity compactications. for an exhaustive list of references on this subject
we refer to the introduction of [2]. here we will cite only the papers dealing with
n pqr spaces (see later).

in this note we generalize some formulae of the riemannian geometry of coset
manifolds to include interesting cases, as the n 010 spaces in the manifest su(3) 
su(2) invariant formulation. the general formulas of ref. [3, 4] are valid only for
diagonal killing metric, and need to be extended for nondiagonal killing metrics.
while it is true that the killing metric can always be made diagonal by a redef-
inition of the group generators, it may happen that the g/h structure we want
to obtain prevents such a redenition, and that we must live with a nondiagonal
killing metric. for the geometry of the n pqr coset spaces, and their use in d = 11
supergravity compactications, we refer to the original papers [5, 6, 7]. recent
developments using n pqr geometry to derive kaluza-klein mass spectra and test
ads4/cf t3 correspondence are found in [8, 9, 10].

we give now a short review of coset space geometry, beginning with a few
denitions. a metric space is said to be homogeneous if it admits as an isometry
the transitive action of a group g, transitive meaning that any two points of the
space are connected via the group action. for example the unit sphere s2 in r3 is
isometric under the transitive action of so(3). the subgroup h of g which leaves
a point x xed is called the isotropy subgroup. because of the transitive action of
g, any other point x = gx (g  g, g / h) is invariant under a subgroup ghg1
of g isomorphic to h. in the s2 example any point remains xed under so(2)
rotations around the axis passing through that point, so that so(2) is the isotropy
subgroup.

it is natural to label the points x of a homogeneous space by the parameters
describing the g - group element which carries a conventional x0 (the origin) into x.
however these parameters are redundant: there are innitely many group elements
g such that x = gx0, due to h - isotropy. indeed if g carries x0 into x, any other
g element of the form gh does the same, since hx0 = x0. we are then led to
characterize the points of a homogeneous space by the cosets gh.

a homogeneous space is therefore a coset space g/h, i.e. the set of equivalence
classes of elements of g, where the equivalence is dened by right h multiplication
(g  g if g = gh, with g, g  g and h  h). thus the two-sphere s2 can
be considered as the coset space so(3)/so(2). in general for an n-sphere sn =
so(n + 1)/so(n). the action of an element g  g on the coset gh is simply given

1

by the coset ggh.

taking g to be a lie group (as in our s2 example), we obtain coset manifolds,
endowed with a riemannian structure as we will discuss. the lie algebra of g can
be split as:

g = h  k

ia kb
ab kc

(1.1)

(1.2)

where h is the lie algebra of h and k contains the remaining generators, called
coset generators. the structure constants of g are dened by:
hi  h
ka  k

[hi, hj] = c k
[hi, ka] = c j
[ka, kb] = c j

ij hk
ia hj + c b
ab hj + c c

where the index conventions are obvious.

as discussed in ref. [11] (p. 251), whenever h is compact or semisimple (even if
g is not compact) one can always nd a set of ka such that the structure constants
c j
ia vanish. in that case the g = h + k split, or equivalently the coset space g/h
is said to be reductive. for this reason we will deal in this note only with reductive
coset spaces. another important observation is that when g/h is reductive the
structure constants c b
ia can always be made antisymmetric in a, b by an appropriate
redenition ka  n b
a kb. the proof is simple: any representation of a compact h
can be made unitary by a suitable change of basis. since the c b
ia generate a real
representation of h (namely the coset representation), this representation can be
made orthogonal, and consequently the c b

ia antisymmetric [11, 12].

an element g of g is specied by dimg continuous parameters, the lie group

coordinates. for example we can exponentiate the lie algebra as:

g = exp[yaka] exp[xihi]

(1.3)

the g coordinates are ya, xi.
it is clear that the cosets gh are characterized
by a subset of the group coordinates, i.e. by the dimg  dimh parameters ya
corresponding to the ka generators.
each coset, labeled by the y parameters, can be mapped into an element l(y)
of g, the coset representative. for example one can choose as coset representative:

l(y) = exp[yaka]

(1.4)

the whole geometry of g/h can be constructed in terms of coset representatives.
under left multiplication by a generic element g of g, l(y) is in general carried
into an element of g belonging to another equivalence class, with representative
element l(y), i.e. into an element of the form l(y)h:
h  h

gl(y) = l(y)h,

(1.5)

where y and h depend on y and g, and on the way of choosing representatives. for
example, using the representative choice (1.4), gl(y) loses the exp(yk) form but
can be expressed (as any element of g) as exp(yk) exp(xh) or l(y) exp(xh). it is
clear that the geometry of g/h must be insensitive to the particular representative
choice, and indeed this is so (see later).

2 vielbeins,

invariant metric, h-connection on

g/h

consider the 1-form:

v (y) = l1(y)dl(y)

(2.6)

generalizing the left-invariant 1-form g1dg of group manifolds. v (y) is lie algebra
valued and can expanded on the g generators:

v (y) = v a(y)ta + i(y)ti

(2.7)

the 1-form v a(y) = v a
called the h-connection.

 dy is a covariant frame (vielbein) on g/h and  i

 dy is

under left multiplication by a constant g  g, the one-form l1dl is not

invariant, but transforms as:

v (y) = hl1(y)g1d(gl(y)h1) = hv (y)h1 + hdh1

(2.8)

in particular its projection on the coset generators yields the transformation rule
of the vielbein:

v a(y) = (hv (y)h1)a = v b(y)d a

b (h1)

(2.9)

where the adjoint representation d b

a is dened by g1tag = d a

b (g)tb.

the innitesimal form of (1.5) is obtained by taking:

g = 1 + ata

consequently, also the induced h transformation is innitesimal:

and the shift in y is proportional to a:

h = 1  aw i

a(y)ti

y = ya + ak 

a (y)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

the y dependent matrix w i
the y-dependent dierential operator

a(y) dened in (2.11) is called the h-compensator, and

ka(y)  k 

a (y)


y

(2.13)

is the killing vector on g/h associated to the g-generator ta. the explicit ex-
pressions for the h-compensator and the killing vectors are simply obtained by
rewriting the transformation rule (1.5) for innitesimal g:

tal(y) = ka(y)l(y)  l(y)tiw i

a (y)

(2.14)

3

after multiplying on the left by l1(y) and projecting on the k and h generators
we nd:

k 
w i

a (y) = d a
a (y) =  i

a (l(y))v 
 (y)k 

a (y)

a (y)  d i

a (l(y))

where v 

a (y) is dened as the inverse of the g/h vielbein v a
 .

the innitesimal form of the vielbein transformation (2.9) reads:

v a(y + y)  v a(y) = aw i
y = ak 

a (y)

a (y)c a

ib v b(y)

(2.15)
(2.16)

(2.17)
(2.18)

easily derived by observing that the c a
sentation of h, and c a

ij = 0.
for reductive algebras c a

can be made antisymmetric in a, b: then eq. (2.17)
implies that the left action of g on v a(y) is equivalent to an so(n) rotation on
v a(y) (n = dim g/h). then the natural coset metric

ib

ib are the generators of the adjoint repre-

g = abv a

 v b



(2.19)

is invariant under the left action of g. another g left-invariant metric is obtained
ad c d
by replacing the kronecker delta in (2.19) with the killing metric ab  c c
restricted to g/h

bc

g = abv a

 v b



(2.20)

notice that both these invariant metrics are insensitive to the choice of coset rep-
resentative. indeed replacing l(y) by l(y)h just rotates the vielbein as in (2.17).

transformations that leave the metric invariant are called isometries. from the
preceding discussion we know that the isometries of g/h manifolds include the
left action of g. however one can study also the right action of g on the coset
representative:

l(y)g = l(y)h

(2.21)

then one nds that n(h)/h is the right isometry group of g/h, where n(h) is
the normalizer of h in g, i.e. the set of elements g  g such that ghg1 = h. one
is led to conclude that the full isometry group of g/h must include g  n(h)/h:
however this is not always true, as argued in ref.s [3, 4]. some left u(1) killing
vectors may coincide with some right u(1) killing vectors: then the actual isometry
is reduced to g  n(h)/h where g = g (common u(1) - factors).

3 rescaled riemann connection and curvature

in general the two metrics (2.19),(2.20) of the preceding section are not the only
g-invariant metrics on g/h. as discussed in various ref.s (see for example [3, 11,
4]) whenever c b
is block diagonal in some subspaces s1, s2, ... of k, then the

ia

4

vielbeins spanning these subspaces can be independently rescaled without loss of
left g symmetry. this is easily understood from the transformation rule (2.17),
which remains unaltered when the vielbeins belonging to the same subspace si are
rescaled by a common parameter ri. therefore the number of rescaling parameters,
i.e. the number of parameters necessary to specify the particular g-invariant metric,
is equal to the number of irreducible blocks of c b
. this matrix describes how h
acts on the subspace k: if it acts irreducibly, the coset is called isotropy irreducible,
and only the trivial rescaling v a  rv a (same r for all v a) is g-symmetric.
if
g/h is isotropy reducible, we have an independent parameter for each irreducible
subspace si. these rescalings must be real and nonsingular, but are otherwise
unconstrained. we derive now the expressions for the riemann connection and the
curvature corresponding to the rescaled vielbeins.

4 the geometry of the n 010 coset manifolds

we apply here the formulae of the preceding section to the coset manifolds n 010.
these coset spaces are a special case in the class of the n pqr coset spaces dened
by the quotient:

n pqr =

g
h

=

su(3)  u(1)
u(1)  u(1)

where the p, q, r are integer and coprime, and specify how the two u(1) generators
m, n of h are embedded into g:

with

r = p3p2 + q2 + 2r2, q = p3p2 + q2
2  and  i

(4.44)
and z is the remaining u(1) generator in the coset. the generators of g = su(3)
u(1) are taken to be  i
2y ,  being the gell-mann matrices. for a detailed
account of the geometry of these n pqr coset manifolds we refer to the original papers
[5, 6], where symmetric rescalings, connection and curvature are given explicitly.
the cosets n pqr for p = 0, q = 1, r = 0 have as isometry group su(3)  su(2)
(coming from g  n(h)/h). as already observed in [5], the n 010 cosets can also
be realized as:

n 010 =

su(3)  su(2)
su(2)  u(1)

where the su(2) in the denominator is diagonally embedded in g = su(3)su(2).
in this formulation the full isometry of n 010 comes from the left action of g. we
now study the geometry of n 010 realized as in (4.45).

the generators of su(3) and su(2) are taken respectively to be  i

2  , 
being the gell-mann matrices and  the pauli matrices, with commutation relations:

2 and  i

[i, j] = 2i fijkk,

[m, n] = 2i mnrr

(4.46)

where the nonvanishing components of the completely antisymmetric structure con-
stants fijk are f123 = 1, f147 = f165 = f246 = f257 = f345 = f376 = 1
2, f458 = f678 =

the u(1) in the denominator of (4.45) is given by the hypercharge  i

the h + k generators are:

with a = ( a, a) = 4, 5, 6, 7. the killing metric in this basis is diagonal on the
coset directions and on the h directions:

ab = 5ab, ab = 3ab

n n = 3, ij = 5ij

and has nondiagonal components along hk directions:

ia = ai = ai

(4.53)

(4.54)

(4.55)

by inspection of the c k
hk structure constants we see that these are antisymmetric
in the two coset indices, and that there are two isotropy-irreducible subspaces,
spanned respectively by the vielbeins v a (a = 1, 2, 3) and v a (a = 4, 5, 6, 7). we
can therefore construct g-invariant metrics depending on two independent rescaling
parameters,  = ra and  = ra. applying the general formulae of the preceding

inuence on the geometry, whereas dierent signs of  yield dierent spaces.

5 ads4 n 010 as compactication of d = 11 super-

gravity

as observed in the early eighties [13], a nontrivial solution of the d = 11 supergrav-
ity eld equations is given by setting the gravitino curvature to zero, and taking

9

the bosonic curvatures as:

rmn = 24e2mn, rab = 12e2ab, fmnpq = emnpq

(5.71)

all other curvature components vanishing. the indices m, n, p, q run on 4-spacetime
and a, b on the internal 7-dimensional space; rmn and rab are the corresponding
ricci curvatures, in our conventions rmn = rq
m qn, and fmnpq is the curl of the
antisymmetric three-index tensor.

then all spaces of the type ads4 (7-dimensional einstein space) are a solution
of the supergravity equations, einstein space meaning a riemannian manifold with
ricci tensor proportional to the metric. a classication of all 7-dimensional g/h
einstein manifolds was derived in the eighties in [14], thus providing a class of
d = 11 supergravity solutions (for their use in the more recent g/h m-branes
see [15]). the coset manifolds n 010 studied in the preceding section are part of
this classication, although they were studied as particular instances of the n pqr
spaces, in the su(3)  u(1) - isometric formulation. two inequivalent einstein
metrics were found, and the corresponding einstein spaces were denoted by n pqr
and n pqr
ii

[5, 7, 6].

what can we say about einstein metrics in the n 010 cosets discussed in this
paper ? as easily seen from the expression of the ricci tensor in (4.69), (4.70) the
rescalings

2 = 32e2

both bring the ricci tensor in the einstein form rab = 12e2ab. we denote by n 010
and n 010
the corresponding einstein coset spaces, since these coincide with the
ii
n pqr
and n pqr
for p = 0, q = 1, r = 0, as one can easily prove by comparing the
ii
riemann curvatures.

finally, we can investigate the supersymmetry content of the ads4  n com-
pactications. we recall that the independent supersymmetry charges preserving
the ads4  n vacuum are in 1-1 correspondence with the number of spinors 
satisfying the equation:

(d +

1
4

babab  ev aa) = 0

(5.74)

which is just the requirement that the supersymmetry variation of the gravitino
[16, 4]). the integrability
vanishes in the ads4  n background (see for ex.
condition for (5.74) is
ab)cd = 0

ab + 4e2cd

(5.75)

(rcd

substituting into (5.75) the riemann tensor of eqs. (4.62)-(4.68) with the rescalings
2 = 4e2,
2 = 32e2 yields four independent spinors  satisfying (5.75), while for

10

9 e2,

2 = 160

the rescalings 2 = 100
9 e2 only one spinor  exists. then one has to
check whether these spinors also satisfy (5.74). whereas the sign of  is irrelevant
in the integrability condition (since the riemann curvature does not depend on
it), it becomes important in the supersymmetry variation (5.74), and we nd the
following:

where we have denoted by n the spaces obtained by reversing the orientation of
n 010, i.e. by taking v a  v a or equivalently ,   ,. thus changing
signs in  is equivalent to reverse the orientation, since the sign of  has no inuence
on the geometry.

p = 0, q = 1 the isometry is promoted to su(3) su(2) because of the right action
of n(h)/h = su(2).
