abstract

inspired by a work of brace, morariu and zumino, we give a simple proof that the

type iia/iib eective actions compactied on t d are invariant under the t-duality group

so(d, d; z) if r-r potentials transform as a majorana-weyl spinor of so(d, d; z) after

combined suitably with ns-ns 2-form.

1 introduction

recent developments in string theory have been based on various kinds of duality sym-

metries. among them, the t-duality was found rst [1, 2], which changes the size of the

compactied space into its inverse in string unit. although this symmetry was rst recog-

nized in the spectra of perturbative strings, it came to be believed that this should hold

as an exact symmetry not simply as a perturbative one [3]. moreover, supergravities in

various dimensions were shown also to have this symmetry if they can be obtained from 10-

dimensional type iia/iib supergravity through dimensional reduction on a d-dimensional

torus t d. this fact is well understood for the ns-ns sector of supergravity action [4].

there the kinetic term of the kaluza-klein (kk) scalars (gij, bij) (i, j = 1, ..., d) can be
written as1

with a 2d  2d matrix

lns = e2 tr(cid:16)m 1m(cid:17)

m = (m rs) =   g1

bg1 g  bg1b!

g1b

(1.1)

(1.2)

and the (10d)-dimensional dilaton . thus the kinetic term is manifestly invariant under
t-duality transformations   o(d, d, z) if the dilaton does not change and m = (m rs)
(r, s = 1, .., 2d) transforms as

the kk 1-forms (gi, bi) give a vector representation of o(d, d; z) and also have an

m = (cid:16)1(cid:17)t

 m  1.

(1.3)

invariant kinetic term [4].

on the other hand, as for the sector including r-r potentials, the invariance of the

action under the full o(d, d; z) does not seem manifest in the literature to our knowledge,

although some results are obtained for nahm transformations which generate a subgroup

of o(d, d; z) [5]. recently, a nice observation was made by brace, morariu and zumino

[6, 7] that the invariance would be established if the dimensionally-reduced action could

be rewritten as

1 this bij will be denoted by b(0)

ij

in the following sections to notify that this is a scalar for the

lr = d s(m) d,

(1.4)

noncompact (10  d)-dimensional space-time with coordinates x ( = 0, 1, ..., 9d).

2

where s(m) (,  = 1, ..., 2d) is the representation matrix of m in the majorana rep-

resentation of o(d, d; r), and d = (d) assembles relevant r-r potentials suitably com-

bined with ns-ns 2-forms as will be dened later. then, the invariance becomes apparent

if the d transforms as a majorana spinor under o(d, d; z):

d = s()d.

(1.5)

furthermore if we think only about the dualities within either type iia or type iib, then

d = (d) will have a denite chirality and thus reduces to a majorana-weyl spinor. the

main aim of this paper is to present a simple proof for these statements with arbitrary d,

and to generalize them in such a way that kk forms of higher degrees are also included.

the present paper is organized as follows. in section 2, in order to x our convention,

we rst give a brief review on the invariance of the ns-ns sector and then introduce new

potentials d. in section 3, we explicitly construct the spinor representations of o(d, d; z)

closely following [6, 7], and then rewrite the r-r kinetic term in section 4. section 5 is

devoted to discussions.

2 type iia/iib eective actions

ten-dimensional type iia/iib supergravity has the following bosonic action in terms of

the string metric [8]:

sns =

sr = 

s = sns + sr + scs

(2.1)

dimensional metric, ns-ns 2-form and dilaton, respectively. the ns-ns eld strength is

here p runs over p = 0, 2, 4, ... for type iia, and p = 1, 1, 3, ... for type iib. the
x ( = 0, 1, ..., 9) are 10-dimensional coordinates, and bg, bb and b denote the 10-
written as ch3 = dbb2 with bb2 = (1/2)bbdx  dx. we adopt a rule that the subscript of
consider a sum of forms of various degrees like b = pk bk = pk(1/k!)b1...k dx1 

a form stands for its degree when it has a denite meaning in 10 dimensions. we also often

3

    dxk , and for this we introduce the invariant norm as

1

2

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)b(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
bg  xk

k! bg 1 1   bg k k b1...kb1...k.

the r-r eld strengths bfp+2 are dened as

bf1 = dc0,
bf3 = dc2 + ch3  c0,
bf5 = dc4 + 1

2ch3  c2  1

2 bb2  dc2.

bf2 = dc1,
bf4 = dc3 +ch3  c1,

(2.2)

(2.3)

the last term scs in (2.1) is the chern-simons term [8]. we do not write down its explicit

form here since this term is not relevant to our discussion.

when the ten-dimensional type ii superstring is compactied on a d-dimensional

torus, various kk forms appear from the ns-ns and r-r elds. we parametrize the

10-dimensional metric as

dbs2  bgdxdx

= gdxdx + gij(dyi + ai

dx)(dyj + aj

dx).

(2.4)

here the 10-dimensional coordinates are decomposed as (x) = (x, yi) ( = 0, 1, ..., 9
d; i = 1, 2, ..., d), and we assume that all the elds depend only on the noncompact

coordinates x. with this parametrization, the kinetic term for potentials will take a

complicated form since the kk 1-form

a(1) i  ai

dx

(2.5)

will appear when contracting the indices o-diagonally. to simplify this, we follow the

prescription of [4] which we found can be restated as follows. first, given a sum of forms

b =pk bk, we decompose it as
b =xq xn

n! b(q)
where the superscript (q) indicates that b(q)

1

1

i1...in dyi1      dyin,

i1...in is a q-form for noncompact indices:

(2.6)

(2.7)

i1...in =

b(q)

q! b1...q i1...indx1      dxq .

4

second, we introduce a new form  by replacing dyi in b with dyi a(1) i, and reorganize

it as in (2.6):

  b(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)dyidyia(1) i
= xq xn

1
n!

 (q)
i1...in dyi1      dyin.

(2.8)

then the kinetic term can be expressed in such a way that all the indices are contracted

only with g or gij:

where we have dened

g,g xq xn (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)  (q)

n

this form of action makes manifest its invariance under the t-duality group o(d, d; z)

and  =  a b

c

on the other hand, after toroidal compactication, r-r potentials cp+1 = (1/(p +
1)!) c1...p+1 dx1      dxp+1 will produce kk forms of various degrees. to simplify
the transformation laws of these kk forms, we rst combine the r-r potentials with the

6

ns-ns 2-form in 10 dimensions as follows:

d0  c0,
d2  c2 + bb2  c0,
d4  c4 + 1

2 bb2  c2 + 1

2 bb2  bb2  c0.

d1  c1,
d3  c3 + bb2  c1,

the r-r eld strengths are then expressed with these dp+1 as

bf1 = dd0,
bf3 = dd2  bb2  dd0,
bf5 = dd4  bb2  dd2 + 1

2 bb2  bb2  dd0.

these can be written in a simple form

bf2 = dd1,
bf4 = dd3  bb2  dd1,

if we introduce

bf = ebb2  dd

d  xp

dp+1,

bf  xp bfp+2.

furthermore, as we did for ns-ns elds, we introduce the primed eld for bf as

then the kinetic term will be expressed as

f   bf (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)dyidyia(1) i .

lr =

g | f  |2

g,g .

(2.21)

(2.22)

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

to show that lr is invariant under o(d, d; z) if d transforms as a majorana spinor
of o(d, d; z), we in the next section explicitly construct the spinor representation of

o(d, d; r) by using fermionic operators. we mostly follow the convention of [6, 7].

3 spinor representation of o(d, d; r)

we rst recall that the group o(d, d; r) consists of 2d  2d matrices  satisfying

j =  0

1d

1d

0 ! .

t j  = j,

7

(3.1)

the group o(d, d; z) is dened as a subgroup that consists of matrices with integer-valued

elements. it is known that both are generated by the following three types of matrices

[9]:

0

b =   1 b
1 ! ,
r =   r1
rt! ,
i =   1  ei ei
1  ei! ,

ei

0

0

bt = b,

r  gl(d; r),

(3.2)

(3.3)

(ei)jk = ijik,

(i = 1, ..., d).

(3.4)

note that det b = det r = +1 and det i = 1. thus one can construct a subgroup
so(d, d; r) or so(d, d; z) as such that are generated by b, r and ij.

the dirac matrices r = (r

) are introduced as

{r, s} = 2j rs

(r, s = 1, ..., 2d),

and the spinor representation s() = (s()) is characterized by the property

s()  s  s()1 =xr

rrs.

(3.5)

(3.6)

to construct this representation, we introduce fermionic operators ai and ai with the

anti-commutation relations

{ai, aj} = i

j,

{ai, aj} = 0 = {ai, aj}

(i, j = 1, ..., d).

(3.7)

we dene the hermitian conjugation as

(ai) = ai,

(3.8)

and introduce the vacuum | 0 i such that ai | 0 i = 0 (i = 1, ..., d) and h 0 | 0 i = 1. then
the 2d-dimensional fermion fock space is spanned by the vectors

| i = ai1    ain | 0 i

(n = 0, ..., d),

(3.9)

where  is a multi-index  = (i1, ..., in) (i1 <   < in), and the dirac matrices can be
introduced with respect to this as follows:

ai |  i = x |  i
ai |  i = x |  i

8

1

2(cid:16)i(cid:17)
2(cid:16)d+i(cid:17)

1

.

(3.10)

thus, if we can always introduce an operator  to any element

j)

 =  (ai

(cij)

j)!  o(d, d; r)

(bij)
(di

such that

( aj1, aj1 ) = ( aiai

j + aicij, aibij + aidi

= ( a, a )  a b
d! ,

c

(3.11)

(3.12)

j )

then, introducing the matrix s() by |  i = p | i s(), we can establish the

relation (3.6). for this, it is enough to construct the operators that correspond to the

elements given in (3.2)-(3.4), and it is easy to show that the followings are solutions [6, 7]:

b = eb  exp(cid:18)
r = (det r)1/2 exp(cid:16)aiai

bijaiaj(cid:19) ,
jaj(cid:17)

1
2

i = ai + ai

(i = 1, ..., d).

(cid:16)r =(cid:16)ri

j(cid:17) = exp(cid:16)ai

j(cid:17)(cid:17) ,

(3.13)

notice that all of these operators give real-valued matrix elements, so that the resulting

representation is automatically majorana. note also that the is do not give a faithful

representation so that there are always ambiguities in their orderings.

in order to construct weyl representations, we dene a matrix

2d+1 

1
2d

dyi=1

(i + d+i)(i  d+i)

(3.14)

which satises n2d+1, ro = 0 (r = 1, ..., 2d). by looking at the correspondence (3.10),
one can easily see that 2d+1 corresponds to (1)nf with nf = pi aiai. thus, the
projection to the subspace with (1)nf = 1 leads to a majorana-weyl representation
(cid:16)2d1(cid:17)s
. note that i is a linear function

and the other one with (1)nf = 1 to(cid:16)2d1(cid:17)c

of fermions and thus changes the chirality. therefore, in order for an operator to preserve

the chirality it must correspond to an element in so(d, d; r).

we nally introduce an operator j that corresponds to j = (j rs):

where the phase factor is chosen such that j2 = 1. one can actually prove that

j = id(d1)/2 1    d,

j ai j = ai,

j ai j = ai.

9

(3.15)

(3.16)

it is easy to check that for all these s (and thus for all elements in o(d, d; r)), their
transposes t = j  1  j are mapped to :

 = j1j.

in particular, we have



b = eb

= exp(cid:18)1

2

bij aiaj(cid:19) ,

t

0

b =  1

b 1! .

(3.17)

(3.18)

note also that the normalization of the operators (3.13) is correctly chosen such that they

satisfy the condition (3.17).

4 r-r potentials and t-duality

in this section, we show that the kinetic term of r-r potentials is actually invariant under

so(d, d; z) if our r-r elds d = (d) transform as a majorana-weyl spinor.

we rst introduce a one-to-one correspondence between the set of forms and the space

of creation operators by relating

 =xn

1
n!

i1...indyi1      dyin =xq xn

1
n!

(q)
i1...indyi1      dyin

to

 xn

1
n!

i1...inai1    ain =xq xn

1
n!

(q)
i1...inai1    ain.

(4.1)

(4.2)

this actually gives an isomorphism as an algebra. we also take a rule that (q)

i1...in has
nf = q, and thus it will anticommute with all the fermionic operators when q is odd. we

dene a state corresponding to  as

note that the following holds for any two forms  and :

| i  | 0 i .

| i = |   i .

(4.3)

(4.4)

now that we have the above isomorphism, we can introduce the operator corresponding

to bf in (2.23):

bf = ebb2 dd.

10

(4.5)

since fp+2 are even (odd) forms for type iia (iib), we have (1)nf(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) fe = +(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) fe for type
iia and = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) fe for type iib. this implies that each state has a denite chirality and

thus forms a majorana-weyl representation of so(d, d; z). noticing that the replacement
dyi  dyi  a(1) i as in (2.25) is equivalent to the operation
= ai  a(1) i,

ai  eaia(1) i

aieaia(1) i

(4.6)

we can simply express the operator corresponding to f  as

and thus the corresponding state can be written as

f = eaia(1) ibfeaia(1) i

,

| f  i = f | 0 i = eaia(1) ibf| 0 i

= eaia(1) i

ebb2 | dd i = eaia(1) i

ebb2eaia(1) i

 eaia(1) i

| dd i .

here one can use (2.14) to show that

eaia(1) ibb2eaia(1) i

therefore we have

=

b(0)

ij aiaj + b(1)

i ai

b(1)

i a(1) i + b(2).

since (cid:16)b(1)

as

, a(1) i(cid:17)t

transforms as a vector of o(d, d; z), one can see that v transforms

v =  v 1

(4.12)

for   so(d, d; z). in fact,

(1)

b

b(1)

v = (a, a)
=  (a, a) 1

a(1)  = (a, a) 

a(1) 
a(1)  =  v 1.

b(1)

11

(4.13)

on the other hand, if we make a block-wise gauss decomposition of m as

m =   1d

0

1d!   g1
b(0)
b(0)  g  b(0),

0

= t

0

g!   1d b(0)
1d !

0

then the corresponding operator m will be written as

m = eb(0) 

g eb(0)

with

g eaihi

j aj

g 

(cid:18)(gij) = e(hi

j)(cid:19) .

this operator g has a special property. in fact, suppose that for a given state

| i =xq xn

1
n!

(q)
i1...in ai1    ain | 0 i ,

we introduce its hermitian conjugate as

h | =xq xn

1
n! h 0 | ain    ai1 10d (q)

i1...in,

(4.14)

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

(4.18)

where 10d is the hodge-star in the noncompact (10 d) dimensions. then the following
identity holds:

d10dxg g | |2

g,g = h | g | i .

in fact, using

g | i = xq xn
= xq xn

we can show

g

= d10dxg g | |2

i1...in  (q)
g,g .

j1...jn(cid:17) gi1j1    ginjn

setting  = f  in (4.19), we have

d10dxg g | f  |2

g,g = h f  | g | f  i .
12

(4.19)

(4.20)

(4.21)

(4.22)

since this f  is written as in (4.10), we can rewrite the right-hand side as h | m| i with
| i = exp(cid:16)b(2)(cid:17) exp (v)| dd i. since m, v and b(2) transform as

m 1,

v =  v 1,

b(2) = b(2),

(4.23)

m =(cid:16)1(cid:17)

we see that the action is invariant under the whole t-duality group so(d, d; z) if the

d = (d) transforms as a majorana-weyl spinor:

furthermore, if we expand d with respect to noncompact indices as

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) de = | d i .

d =xq

1
q!

dx1    dxq d1...q

with

d1...q xn

1
n!

d1...q i1...in dyi1     dyin,

then each coecient d1...q will also tranform as a majorana spinor:

or equivalently,

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) d1...qe = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) d1...qe ,
d1...q  =x

s() d1...q

with multi-indices  = (i1, ..., in)

(i1 <    < in; n = 0, ..., d). furthermore, since
d1...q i1...in vanishes if q + n = even (odd) for type iia (iib), it has a denite chi-

rality. this implies that d1...q transforms as a majorana-weyl spinor for each set of

noncompact indices (1, ..., q).

5 discussion

in the present article, we have given a simple proof that if the r-r potentials cp+1

are combined with the ns-ns 2-form as in (2.21), then their kk forms transform as

majorana-weyl spinors under the t-duality group so(d, d; z).

there should be various applications once transformation rules are obtained explicitly

for the whole t-duality group. one will be to establish relations among various classical

solutions of type iia/iib supergravities by using the full t-duality group together with

the s-duality of type iib. the work in this direction is in progress and will be reported

elsewhere.

we nally make a comment on the dilaton dependence in r-r potentials, assuming

the case bb2 = 0 in which there is no distinction between the original r-r potential c and
our potential d. usually we expect that another eld strength dened by fp+2 = eb dcp+1
corresponds to an r-r vertex operator of nsr strings in a at background. to see this in
our formulation, we rst recall that we have introduced the (10d)-dimensional dilaton 
as a singlet of o(d, d; z). this implies that the 10-dimensional dilaton b should transform
as eb  g1/4. on the other hand, we could have further decomposed the operator g
as g = 
ee where e = (eia) (i, a = 1, ..., d) is a vielbein for g, g = e et . then
one might say that the state e | dc i corresponds to an r-r vertex in a at background.
thus, noticing that the operator e will carry the factor g1/4, we expect that eb dc will

transform as in a at case.
