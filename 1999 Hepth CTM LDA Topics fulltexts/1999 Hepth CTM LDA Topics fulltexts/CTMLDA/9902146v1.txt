abstract

we discuss the topological properties of a two-dimensional free abelian gauge theory
in the framework of brst cohomology. we derive the conserved and nilpotent brst and
co-brst charges and express the hodge decomposition theorem in terms of these charges
and the laplacian operator. it is because of the topological nature of the free u(1) gauge
theory that the laplacian operator goes to zero when equations of motion are exploited.
we derive two sets of topological invariants of this theory which are related to each-other
by a certain kind of duality transformation.

1 introduction

one of the key theorems in the mathematical aspects of cohomology is the celebrated
hodge decomposition theorem dened on a compact manifold. this theorem states that
any arbitrary p-form fp on this manifold can be decomposed into a harmonic form p
(p = 0, dp = 0, p = 0), an exact form d gp1 and a co-exact form  hp+1:

fp = p + d gp1 +  hp+1,

(1.1)

where (=   d ) is the hodge dual of d (with d2 = 0, 2 = 0) and laplacian  is dened
as  = (d + )2 = d + d [1-3]. so far, the analogue of d has been found out as the
conserved and nilpotent (q2
b = 0) becchi-rouet-stora-tyutin (brst) charge qb which
generates a nilpotent brst symmetry for a locally gauge invariant lagrangian density in
any arbitrary dimensions of spacetime. the physical state condition qb |phys > = 0 leads
to the annihilation of the physical states in the quantum hilbert space by the rst-class
constraints of the original gauge theory. this requirement is essential for the consistent
quantization of a theory endowed with rst-class constraints (see, e.g., [4-9]). attempts
have also been made to discuss the second-class constraints in the framework of brst
formalism (see, e.g., [10,11] and references therein).

the purpose of the present paper is to provide some physical interpretations to the
analogues of  and  in the language of the nilpotent (for ), local, covariant and contin-
uous symmetry properties of a free u(1) gauge theory described by the brst invariant
lagrangian densities in two (1 + 1) dimensions of spacetime. some attempts [12-16] have
been made towards this goal in four dimensions of spacetime for abelian as well as non-
abelian gauge theories. however, the symmetry transformations turn out to be nonlocal,
noncovariant and even non-nilpotent [17]. we shall demonstrate that in two dimensional
brst invariant free u(1) gauge theory, a conserved and nilpotent co(dual)-brst charge
qd can be dened which corresponds to a nilpotent symmetry transformation under which
the gauge-xing term a = (  a)  remains invariant. this should be compared and con-
trasted with the usual brst transformation under which the two-form f = da remains
invariant in the u(1) gauge theory. further, we show that the anticommutator of both
these charges w = {qb, qd} is the analogue of the laplacian operator  and it turns out
to be the casimir operator for the extended brst algebra. we implement the hodge de-
composition theorem with these charges and show that the requirement of the annihilation
of the physical states by qb and qd is sucient to gauge away both the degrees of freedom
of a single photon in 2d. thus, the theory becomes topological in nature as there are no
propagating degrees of freedom left in this theory [18]. as a consequence, the casimir
operator goes to zero (w  0) when the equations of motion are exploited and all the
elds are assumed to fall o rapidly at x  . this situation should be contrasted with

 here one-form a = a dx denes the vector potential a of u (1) gauge theory. furthermore, it
can be easily seen that the two-form f = da and the gauge-xing term (  a) =  a are hodge dual to
each-other in the abelian gauge theory (see, e.g., ref. [2]).

3

the 2d interacting theory where the gauge elds are coupled to the matter elds [19]. in
the latter case, w does not go to zero on the on-shell because of the presence of the matter
degrees of freedom in the theory. for the topological 2d free u(1) gauge theory, we derive
two sets of topological invariants with respect to both the nilpotent charges qb and qd.
these invariants turn out to be connected with each-other by a duality transformation.

the outline of our paper is as follows. in sec. 2, we set up the notations and sketch
briey the essentials of the brst formalism for u(1) gauge theory in any arbitrary di-
mensions of spacetime. sec. 3 is devoted to the derivation of the nilpotent and conserved
(anti)dual brst charges and the laplacian operator in two dimensions of spacetime. this
is followed, in sec. 4, by the discussion of an extended brst algebra which is constituted
by six conserved charges. we discuss hodge decomposition theorem and obtain two sets of
topological invariants in sec. 5. finally, we make some concluding remarks in sec. 6.

2 preliminary: brst invariant lagrangians

we begin with the brst invariant lagrangian density (lb) for the u(1) gauge theory in
the feynman gauge (see, e.g., [5-9])

lb =  1

4 f f  1

2(  a)2  i cc,

(2.1)

where the rst term is the classical maxwell lagrangian density and second and third
terms are the gauge-xing and faddeev-popov ghost terms respectively. here the u(1)
gauge connection a is dened through the one-form a = a dx and the curvature term
f = a  a (,  = 0, 1, 2, ....d  1) is obtained from the two-form f = da in
any d-dimensional at minkowski spacetime. furthermore, the gauge-xing term (  a) =
a  a, is the hodge dual of the two-form f = da and c(c) are the anti (ghost)
elds. the following on-shell (c = 0) nilpotent (2

b = 0) symmetry transformations

ba = c,
b c = i(  a),

bc = 0,

bf = 0,
b(  a) = c,

lead to the derivation of a conserved and on-shell nilpotent brst charge qb

qb = z dd1x [ 0(  a)c  (  a)0c ],

(2.2)

(2.3)

where  is an anticommuting spacetime independent innitesimal parameter. introduction
of an auxiliary eld b in the lagrangian density (2.1)

lb =  1

4 f f + b(  a) + 1

2 b2  i c  c,

enables the validity of an o-shell nilpotent (2

b = 0) symmetry transformations

ba =   c,
b c = i  b,

bf = 0,

bc = 0,
b(  a) =   c,

bb = 0,

(2.4)

(2.5)

which lead to the existence of an o-shell nilpotent and conserved brst charge

qb = z d(d1)x [b c  bc].

4

(2.6)

the invariance of the ghost action if.p. = ir ddx cc under discrete symmetry
transformations: c  i c, c  ic implies the existence of a conserved and nilpotent
anti-brst charge (qab) which can be derived from the expressions (2.3) and (2.6) by the
substitution c  i c. the continuous global symmetry invariance of the total action
under the transformations: c  ec, c  e c, a  a, b  b, (where  is a global
parameter), leads to the derivation of the conserved ghost charge (qg)

qg = iz d(d1)x [ c c + c c ].
together, these conserved charges obey the following algebra:

b = 1

2 {qb, qb} = 0, q2

q2
{qb, qab} = qb qab + qab qb = 0,
i[qg, qb] = +qb,

i[qg, qab] = qab,

ab = 1

2 {qab, qab} = 0,

(2.7)

(2.8)

where the cononical (anti)commutators for the brst invariant lagrangians are exploited
for the derivation of the above algebra. this algebra is valid for u(1) gauge theory in any ar-
bitrary dimensions of spacetime. it will be noticed that the anticommutator {qb, qab} = 0
implies that the combined transformations bab + abb acting on any eld produce no
transformation at all. thus, anti-brst charge is not the analogue of the dual(adjoint)
exterior derivative () for the u(1) gauge theory .

3 dual-brst symmetry in two dimensions

in addition to the symmetries: c  i c, c  ic, the ghost action ir d2x  c  c
in 2d respects another symmetry; namely, 

   i   ,

 =  
 .

it turns out that the total 2d lagrangian density (2.1)

lb = 1

2 e2  1

2(  a)2  i cc,

(3.1)

(3.2)

remains invariant under the combination of the above two transformations because the
ghost term remains invariant on its own and the kinetic energy term and gauge-xing term
exchange with each-other:

1

2 e2 = 1

2 (0a1  1a0)2   1

2(  a)2 = 1

2(0a0  1a1)2.

(3.3)

 it has been demonstrated in ref. [20] that the anticommutator of the higher order brst- and anti-
brst charges is not zero and it leads to the denition a higher order laplacian operator for the compact
non-abelian lie algebras.

 we adopt here the notations in which the 2d at minkowski metric is :  = (+1, 1) and  =

  = 00  11, f = 0f, f01 = 0a1  1a0 = e = f 10, 01 = 10 = +1, (  a) = 0a0  1a1.

5

thus, in addition to the gauge brst symmetry (2.2), we have an on-shell ( c = 0)
nilpotent (2

d = 0) dual brst symmetry d for the lagrangian density (3.2)

da =    c,
de =  c,

d c = 0,

dc = ie,
d(  a) = 0,

(3.4)

which can be derived from (2.2) by the substitutions : c  +i c,   +i . we
christen this symmetry as dual brst because, in contrast to b transformations where the
electric eld e is invariant, in the case of d, it is the gauge-xing term (  a) that remains
invariant k. thus, we shall call the duality transformations for the lagrangian density (3.2)
as the ones where : c   i c, c   ic,    i. introducing an auxiliary eld
b, the analogue of the lagrangian density (2.4) can be written as

lb = b e  1

2 b2 + b (  a) + 1

2 b2  i cc,

which respects the following o-shell dual brst symmetry

da =   c,
de =  c,

d c = 0,

dc = ib,

d(  a) = 0,

db = 0,
db = 0.

(3.5)

(3.6)

this o-shell nilpotent dual brst transformations can be obtained from the transfor-
mations (2.5) (with the inclusion of bb = 0) by the substitution : c  +i c,  
+i , b  ib, b  ib. it can be checked that the o-shell nilpotent brst and
dual brst transformations (2.5) and (3.6) are connected with each-other by

c  i c, e  i(  a), b  i b,
c  ic,
(  a)  ie, b  i b,

(3.7)

which is a manifestation of the fact that the lagrangian density (3.5) goes to itself under the
above substitutions. thus, for the lagrangian density (3.5), the duality transformations
are: c   i c, c   ic,    i , b   ib, b   ib . these continuous
symmetries (d,d) lead to the derivation of the following conserved and nilpotent dual brst
charge due to noether theorem

q(d,d) = z dx [e c  e c]  z dx [b c  b c],

(3.8)

which generates (3.4) and (3.6) (i.e., r = i[, qr], r = d, d and (+) stands for
(anti)commutator corresponding to (fermionic)bosonic ). due to discrete symmetry in-
variance of the ghost action under c  i c, c  ic, we have the existence of a conserved
 here and in what follows, we shall take only the (+) sign in the transformations: c  i c, c 

ic,   i . however, analogous statements will be valid if we take () sign.

k as per our denition in the introduction, the gauge-xing term a = (  a) with  = d is the

dual of the two-form f = da which is the electric eld e here in 2d.

note that we have taken the upper sign of these transformations in equation (3.7). however, the above

statements are valid for the lower sign as well.

and nilpotent anti-dual brst charge q(ad,ad) which can be derived from (3.8) by these
substitutions (i.e., c  i c).

6

it is obvious that qb and qd are the fermionic symmetry generators (q2

d = 0)
for the lagrangian density (3.5). thus, the anticommutator of the two ({qb, qd}) will
also be a symmetry generator. the corresponding bosonic transformation w = {b, d}
with the innitesimal bosonic transformation parameter  (= - i  )

b = 0, q2

w a = (b +   b),
w c = 0,

w c = 0,

w b = 0,
w (  a) = b,

w b = 0,
w e = b,

(3.9)

is the symmetry of the above lagrangian density (3.5) because w lb = ([ bb 
bb ]). here  and  are the innitesimal fermionic transformation parameters corre-
sponding to b and d respectively. the generator of the above symmetry transformation
(and the analogue of the laplacian operator) is a conserved charge (w ) given by:

w = z dx [ b b  b b ].

(3.10)

this conserved quantity can be directly calculated from the anticommutator {qb, qd} if we
exploit the canonical (anti)commutators : {c(x, t), c(y, t)} = (x  y), { c(x, t), c(y, t)} =
(x  y), [a0(x, t), b(y, t)] = i(x  y), [a1(x, t), b(y, t)] = i(x  y) and the rest of the
(anti)commutators are zero. here (x  y) is the dirac delta function.

4 extended brst algebra

the set of all the conserved charges are the (anti)brst, (anti)dual brst, ghost and the
w operator. together, these charges for the 2d free u(1) gauge theory are

qb = z dx h b c  b c i,
qd = z dx h b c  b c i,
w = z dx h b b  b b i,

qab = iz dx h b c  b c i,
qad = iz dx h b c  b c i,
qg = iz dx h c c + c c i.

(4.1)

if we exploit the covariant canonical (anti)commutators, these conserved charges obey the
following extended brst algebra

b = q2

d = q2

ab = q2

[w, qk] = 0, k = b, d, ab, ad, g,
q2
ad = 0,
{qb, qd} = {qab, qad} = w,
i[qg, qb] = +qb,
i[qg, qd] = qd,

i[qg, qab] = qab,
i[qg, qad] = +qad,

(4.2)

and all the rest of the (anti)commutators turn out to be zero. a few remarks are in order.
first of all, we see that the operator w is the casimir operator for the whole algebra and
its ghost number is zero. the ghost number of qb and qad is +1 and that of qd and

7

qab is 1. now given a state | > in the quantum hilbert space with the ghost number
n (i.e., iqg| >= n| >), it is straightforward, due to the above commutation relations,
to check that the following relations are satised:

iqg qb| > = (n + 1) qb| >,
iqg qd| > = (n  1) qd| >,
iqg w | > = n w | >,

(4.3)

which demonstrate that, whereas w keeps the ghost number of a state intact and unal-
tered, the operator qb increases the ghost number by one and qd reduces this number by
one. this property is similar to the operation of a laplacian, an exterior derivative and a
dual exterior derivative on a n-form dened on a compact manifold. thus, we see that the
degree of the dierential form is analogous to the ghost number in the hilbert space, the
dierential form itself is analogous to the quantum state in the hilbert space, a compact
manifold has an analogy with the quantum hilbert space and d,  and  = d + d are
qb , qd and w respectively. it is a notable point that d and  can also be identied with
qab and qad in the brst formalism.

5 hodge decomposition theorem and topological invariants

it is obvious from the algebra (4.2) and the consideration of the ghost number of states
(qb| >, qd| > and w | >) in (4.3) that one can now implement the hodge decompo-
sition theorem in the language of brst and dual-brst charges (see, e.g., [3,6])

| >n= | >n + qb|  >n1 + qd | >n+1,

(5.1)

by which, any state | >n in the quantum hilbert space with ghost number n can be
decomposed into a harmonic state | >n, a brst exact state qb| >n1 and a dual-brst
exact state qd| >n+1. to rene the brst cohomology, however, we have to choose a
representative state as the physical state from the total states of the quantum hilbert space.
let us dene here the physical state as the harmonic state (|phys >= | >) in the hodge
decomposed state (5.1). the number of such harmonic states is nite for a given physical
theory as it represents the number of solutions to the laplace equation (see, e.g., ref. [2]).
by denition, such a state would satisfy the following conditions:

w |phys >= 0,

qb |phys >= 0,

qd |phys >= 0.

(5.2)

due to the simple form of the equations of motion (a = 0, c = 0,  c = 0) for the
basic elds in the theory, it is very convenient to express them in the normal modes [21]

a(x, t) = z
c(x, t) = z
c(x, t) = z

dk

dk

dk

(k)eikx i,
(2)1/2(2k0)1/2 h a(k)eikx + a
(2)1/2(2k0)1/2 h c(k)eikx + c(k)eikx i,
(2)1/2(2k0)1/2 h b(k)eikx + b(k)eikx i,

(5.3)

8

where k are the 2d momenta with the components (k0, k1 = k). the on-shell nilpotent
symmetry transformations (2.2) and (3.4), that are generated by the charges qb and qd,
can now be exploited to yield (see, e.g., [21, 22] for details):

(k)] = k c(k),

[qb, a
[qb, a(k)] = kc(k),
{qb, c(k)} = 0,
{qb, c(k)} = 0,
{qb, b(k)} = ika
,
{qb, b(k)} = +ika,

[qd, a
(k)] = k b(k),
[qd, a(k)] = k b(k),
{qd, c(k)} = i ka
,
{qd, c(k)} = i ka,
{qd, b(k)} = 0,
{qd, b(k)} = 0.

similarly, the casimir operator w generates the following commutation relations:

(k)] = ik2(a),

[w, a(k)] = ik2a ,
[w, a
[w, c(k)] = [w, c(k)] = [w, b(k)] = [w, b(k)] = 0.

we are now in a position to dene the physical vacuum |vac > as

qb|vac > = qd|vac > = w |vac > = 0,
a|vac > = c(k)|vac >= b(k)|vac >= 0.

(5.4)

(5.5)

(5.6)

a single photon state |e(k), vac > with polarization vector e can be created from the
physical vacuum by the application of a creation operator ea
|vac > |e(k), vac >.
the physicality criteria: qb|e(k), vac >= (k  e)c(k)|vac >= 0, qd|e(k), vac >=
ekb(k)|vac >= 0 lead to the transversality (k  e = 0) of the photon and the condi-
tion ek = 0 between e and k. together, these conditions remove both the physical
degrees of freedom of the 2d photon and imply the masslessness condition k2 = 0. thus,
the on-shell as well as the mass-shell condition (k2 = 0) is implied due to the presence of
conserved and nilpotent symmetries in the theory. as is well known [16], one of the key
characteristic features of the topological eld theories is the absence of propagating degrees
of freedom. this property emerges here from the considerations of the brst cohomology
(see, e.g., ref. [22] for more discussions).

the operation of the w operator on a single photon state (i.e., w |e(k), vac >=
ik2 e(a)|vac >= 0) implies the on-shell condition (a = 0  k2 = 0) as well as
the masslessness condition (k2 = 0) for the photon. all these relations: k  e = 0, ek =
0, k2 = 0 are mutually consistent with one-another. in fact, the validity of any two of the
above relations, implies the third one. thus, if basic symmetries are the central guiding
principle, the operation of the w operator on a single physical photon state is superuous
in some sense because the symmetry corresponding to w can be derived from the symme-
tries generated by qb and qd. this fact is encoded in the expression for the operator w
(cf. (4.1)) which can be re-expressed as

w = z dx d

dx [ 1

2 b2  1

2 b2 ]  0

as x   ,

(5.7)

9

due to the equation of motion b +   b = 0. one can not think of the o-shell validity
of the expression for w in (4.1) because of the considerations of brst cohomology. the
presence of two nilpotent symmetries corresponding to qb and qd and the requirement:
qb|phys >= 0, qd|phys >= 0, forces the physical 2d photon to always satisfy the on-shell
(a = 0) as well as the mass-shell (k2 = 0) condition. thus, there is no escape from the
condition w  0 for a topological eld theory where all the physical degrees of freedom
are gauged away by symmetries alone. the topological nature of the theory is reected
by the presence of the topological invariants on the 2d manifold. the two sets of these
invariants, w.r.t. both the conserved and nilpotent charges, are

ik[ck] = i ck

vk,

jk[ck] = i ck

wk,

(k = 0, 1, 2)

(5.8)

where ck are the k-dimensional homology cycles in the 2d manifold and k-form vk and wk
for the 2d free u(1) gauge theory are juxtaposed as:

v0 = b c,
v1 = [ ba + ic c ] dx,
v2 = i[a c  1
2

w0 = b c,
w1 = [ cc  i ba ] dx,

c f] dx  dx, w2 = i[c a + c

2 (  a)] dx  dx .

(5.9)
it can be seen that v0 and w0 are brst (bv0 = 0) and co-brst invariant (dw0 = 0)
and v2 and w2 are closed (dv2 = 0) and co-closed (w2 = 0) respectively. using the
canonical (anti)commutation relations with iqg, it can be checked that the ghost numbers
for (v0, v1, v2) are (+1, 0, 1) and that of (w0, w1, w2) are (1, 0, +1) respectively. this
fact can be succinctly expressed (for k = 0, 1, 2) as:

i[qg, vk] = (1)1k (k  1) vk,
i[qg, wk] = (1)1k (1  k) wk.

these invariants (for k = 1, 2) obey the following relations (see, e.g., [23], [24], [18])

bvk =  d vk1,
dwk =   wk1,

d = dx ,
 = i dx   ,

(5.10)

(5.11)

where d and  are the exterior and dual-exterior derivatives on the 2d compact manifold.
both these sets of topological invariants are related to each-other by the duality transfor-
mations (3.7) as ik  jk under the sustitutions: b  i b, c  i c,   i .

using the on-shell nilpotent brst- and dual-brst transformations (2.2) and (3.4), it
will be interesting to verify that the lagrangian density (3.2) can be written as the sum of
brst- and co-brst invariant parts:

 lb = 1

2 d[ iec ]  1

2 b[ i(  a) c ].

(5.12)

the invariance of this lagrangian density under brst and dual brst transformations is
easy to see because 2
d = 0 and {d, b}  0 as the laplacian operator goes to zero

b = 0, 2

10

2 ec, s2 =  1

(w  0) for the validity of the equations of motion. furthermore, the expressions in the
square brackets in (5.12) are brst invariant (i.e., b[iec] = 0) and co-brst invariant
(i.e., d[i(  a) c] = 0). using the fact that qr(r = b, d) is the generator of transfor-
mation r = i  [, qr], where (+) stands for the (anti)commutator corresponding
to  being (fermionic)bosonic in nature, it can be seen that (5.12) can be written as:
2 (  a) c. this shows that the free u(1)
lb = {qd, s1} + {qb, s2} for s1 = 1
topological gauge eld theory is similar in form as witten type theories [24] but completely
dierent from schwarz type theories [25]. to be very precise, the free u(1) topological
gauge eld theory is somewhat dierent from ref. [24] too. this is mainly because of the
fact that, in our discussions, there are two conserved and nilpotent charges w.r.t. which
the topological invariants and the brst cohomology are dened. it is straightforward to
check that the partition functions as well as the expectation values of the brst invari-
ants, co-brst invariants and the topological invariants are metric independent . the
key point to show this fact in the framework of brst cohomology is the requirement that
qb|phys >= 0 and qd|phys >= 0 (see, e.g., ref. [18] for details).

6 discussion

it is clear that the usual nilpotent brst transformations correspond to a symmetry in
which the two-form f = da (e.g., electric eld e in 2 d) of the u(1) gauge theory remains
invariant. the nilpotent dual-brst charge is the generator of a transformation in which
the gauge-xing term ((  a) = a) remains invariant. the anticommutator of these
two transformations corresponds to a symmetry that is generated by the casimir operator
for the whole algebra. under this conserved operator, it is the ghost term that remains
invariant.
it is interesting to note that the physical state condition on a single photon
state with polarization e; namely, w |e(k), vac >= qb |e(k), vac >= qd |e(k), vac >= 0,
leads to three conditions: k2 = 0, k  e = 0, ek = 0. in other words, the full brst
cohomology produces the rst condition k2 = 0 which corresponds to the on-shell as well as
the mass-shell condition for the photon. the second condition k  e = 0 is the reection of
( a) |phys >= 0 which is connected with the transversality of photon and the existence of
rst-class primary constraint. the third condition ek = 0 is, however, an interesting
result when u(1) gauge eld is coupled to the dirac elds. in fact, it has been shown in
ref. [19] that the dual-brst transformation da =  c corresponds to the chiral
transformation on the dirac elds for fermions in 2d. the condition qd |phys >= 0 phys-
ically implies that the anomaly term (e   f ) in 2d is zero. in fact, the condition
for the transversality of photon ((  a)|phys >= 0) and the condition for the vanishing of
the anomaly term (e =  a|phys >= 0) are dual to each-other in the 2d interacting
u(1) gauge theory [19]. thus, full strength of the brst cohomology comes to its fore and

 we have taken here only the at minkowski metric. however, our arguments are valid even if we take

into account a nontrivial metric.

establishes the well known result that in 2d, the anomalous gauge theory is consistent,
unitary and amenable to particle interpretation [26,27]. for the free u(1) gauge theory, all
the above three conditions are mutually consistent with one-another and physically they
imply the masslessness and transversality of photon. basically, the existence of the gauge
symmetries: e  e +  k, e  e +   k (for  and  being arbitrary constants),
implies that both the degrees of freedom of photon a can be gauged away in two dimen-
sions of spacetime by symmetry considerations alone and masslessness condition emerges
due to these symmetries. taken together, the above discussions imply that there are no
propagating degrees of freedom of a physical photon in the 2d free u(1) gauge theory. as
a consequence, this theory becomes topological in nature and its existence is encoded in
the vanishing of the laplacian operator as far as the hodge decomposition theorem and
brst cohomology are concerned.
