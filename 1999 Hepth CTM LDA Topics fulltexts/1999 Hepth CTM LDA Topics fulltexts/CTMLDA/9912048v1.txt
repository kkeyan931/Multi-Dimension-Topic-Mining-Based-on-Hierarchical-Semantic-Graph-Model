abstract

we describe a general method for calculating the infra-red limit of physical quan-
tities in unitary quantum eld theories. using analyticity of green functions in
a complex scale parameter, the infra-red limit is expressed as a contour integral
entirely in the ultra-violet region. the infra-red limit is shown to be the limit of
the borel transform of the physical quantity. the method is illustrated by calcu-
lating the central charge of the perturbed unitary minimal models and the critical
exponents of 4 theory in three dimensions. we obtain approximate values for the
central charge which are very close to the exact values using only a one loop pertur-
bative calculation. for 4 theory we obtain estimates which are within the errors
of other more elaborate approaches.

introduction and summary

it is important to get a better understanding of the infra-red limit of quantum eld
theory. conventionally this is studied by extrapolating perturbation theory from the
ultra-violet using the renormalisation group. the purpose of this paper is to show how to
augment this approach with information derived from the analyticity properties of green
functions. these properties are well-known. for example, the kallen-lehmann spectral
representation of the two-point function of a scalar eld shows that it has an analytic
continuation to the complex momentum plane. we will use this to express the infra-red
limit as an integral in the ultra-violet region where perturbation theory is applicable.
for illustration assume that the physical quantity f depends on some distance scale s,
and that f (s) is analytic in the complex plane with the negative axis cut away, then the
contour integral

vanishes, where the contour c is given in gure 1. this means that we can write the
infra-red limit fir = lim|s| f (s) as an integral

over the innitesimal circle c0 and the cut c1.

we show below that the integral over the cut c1 vanishes for large , so that the infra-
red limit fir then is given as an integral in the uv region over c0 where perturbation
theory applies. we call this integral i() and get that fir = lim i().

i() is shown to be the borel transform of f (s) of order k, where k is related to
the way we analytically continue in the complex scale parameter. the borel transform
has also been applied to perturbation theory in [23] where the borel transform in the
coupling is used. in this case assumptions (justied by details of the dynamics) have to
be made about the poles of the borel transform. the essential dierence compared with
our approach is that we transform with respect to the scale parameter. the analytic
properties of green functions, which are needed to dene the borel transform, in this case
follow directly from general principles of quantum eld theory.

we will use this method on two examples where the infra-red limit of the physical
quantity f (s) in question is well known, namely the central charge of the unitary minimal
models perturbed by the relevant eld (1,3), and the critical exponents of 4 theory in
three dimensions.

we also considered the perturbed minimal models in [1] where this method was shown
to improve upon renormalisation group improved perturbation theory by a factor 2. f (s)
is given as the two point function of the energy momentum tensor, and we will here
address some of the details left out of our discussion in [1]. we rst show the analytic

2

properties of f (s), and we then obtain a bound on the exact non perturbative expression
for i(), and this allows us to obtain an approximate value for calculating the central
charge.

we employ this approximation method to calculate the central charge for the free
fermionic and bosonic theories perturbed by a mass term and the unitary minimal models
perturbed by the relevant operator (1,3). the free massive theories can be solved exactly
and these then demonstrate how i() behaves in an exact case. for the perturbed minimal
models we rst calculate f (s) as a renormalisation group improvement of a one loop
perturbative calculation and show that this expression has the correct limit when m  ,
where m characterises the minimal model. we then show how our method improves upon
the perturbative renormalisation group result. if we use the largest domain of analyticity
for f (s) apparent from the spectral decomposition there is something of a surprise. the
approximation becomes dramatically close to the exact value, which is remarkable as it
is only based on one loop perturbation theory.

the other example is 4 theory in three dimensions, where we calculate the critical
exponents  and . 4 theory has been shown to be borel summable of order one in
the perturbative expansion in the coupling constant. the perturbative series will often
at most be asymptotic, if for example a theory is ill dened for negative couplings the
convergence radius will be zero. the question is then if the perturbative series captures
all of the physics when it is only asymptotic. this will depend on the analytic properties
of the correlators, and if the theory is borel summable perturbation theory will contain all
information about the theory. we use the propagator to dene functions f, f which have
the critical exponents  and  as their infra-red limit. all scale dependence is moved into
the coupling using the running coupling so that f(s) and f(s) are given as asymptotic
series in the scale parameter s, and we show their analyticity. in this example the actual
calculation of the physical quantities  and  is dierent form the minimal models case, as
we cannot use the same approximation. the reason is that in this case we use higher order
perturbative expressions (5,6 and 7 loops) and one cannot nd an exact expression for the
perturbative running coupling (unlike the one loop case). the infra-red values for ,  are
therefore obtained from the limiting value of the borel transform, and to calculate this we
use a conformal mapping and pade approximation which is done in the appendix. the
estimates we obtain for ,  are within the errors of other more elaborate approximations.
the main results are that we can use analyticity in the scale parameter to express
the infra-red physics as an integral in the ultra-violet region, the infra-red limit is then
obtained taking the limit in the borel transformed quantity. we show how this works in
two examples with well known infra-red limits.

the outline is as follows: in the next section we will discuss analyticity of correlators,
introduce the contour integral giving the infra-red limit and show that the contribution
from the cut vanishes for large . we also show that the contour integral is the borel
transform of f (s). in section 3 we dene f (s) for the central charge, show its analyticity
and discuss an approximation method for calculating the central charge. an exact bound
on i() is given. in section 4 we use this approximation on the free massive bosonic and
fermionic theory together with the minimal models perturbed by (1,3). in section 5 we
discuss the 4 theory and introduce a function giving the critical exponents ,  in the
infra-red limit, and obtain estimates of  and  from the limit of the borel transform.

2 dening the contour integral

the physical quantities of a quantum eld theory can be written in terms of green
functions which have well known analyticity properties. as an example consider the two
point function of a scalar eld a(p). the kallen-lehmann spectral representation writes
this as a sum over intermediate states

ha(p)a(0)i =z 

0

d2 c(2)

1

p2 + 2

where d2c(2) is the spectral density. introducing the complex scale factor s  c

ha(sp)a(0)i =z 

0

d2 c(2)

1

s2p2 + 2

(1)

(2)

then shows that ha(sp)a(0)i is analytic in the positive half-plane (s) > 0.

generally physical quantities will not be analytic in the positive half-plane but in some

sector s() of the complex plane, dened as

s() = {z = rei | 0 < r < ,  

2 <  < 

2 }.

(3)

note that 0 / s(). we want to calculate the infra-red limit fir of a physical quantity
f (x), where fir = lim|x| f (x), and we will denote the uv limit fu v = lim|x|0 f (x).
we are considering functions which have well dened limits in s(), i.e. lim|s| f (s) =
fir and lims0 f (s) = fu v for s  s().

in the two examples we will consider the physical quantities f (x) are given as func-
tionals of a two point correlator resulting in analytic functions f (s). a large class of
physical quantities will in this way preserve the analytic structure of the green functions
in the theory.

the scale parameter s can of course be introduced into the physical quantity in a
number of ways. we will dene by f (s) the analytical continuation of f (x) where s is

introduced as f (s)  f (sx)|x=1 so that f (s) has the expansion f (s) =p fnsn around the

origin, and f (s) is analytic in s(). choosing another positive power f (sx)|x=1,  > 0,
gives the same ultra-violet and infra-red limits, but dierent intermediate behaviour. let
us now introduce the scale parameter so that the opening of the analytic sector is 2( )
with   1. f (s) = f (sa) is analytic in s = s(2(  )) provided that a = 
2(). we
will now express the infra-red limit as an integral entirely in the ultra-violet region using
analyticity.

using cauchys theorem the analyticity of f (s) implies that the contour integral

the integrand in this integral is damped by the factor e/|s|, and we will show that

to take the limit    in the integrand. we substitute s = rei() for points on c1 in

(11)

so that fir = lim iir() and we have succeeded in writing the infra-red limit as the
limiting value of a contour integral in the ultra-violet region.

we will now use cauchys theorem again to rewrite iir() and this will show that
iir() is the borel transform of f (s). instead of integrating over c0 we will integrate
over c given as the path from the origin along the ray arg(s) =  +  and then anti-
clockwise along |s| = x > 0 until arg(s) =  and then back to the origin. it follows that
this contour integral is independent of the choice of x and  as long as  <  < 
2 . the
upper limit ensures that the rays stay in the negative half-plane (where e/s is a damping
factor), and the lower limit that f (s) is analytic on the contour. using this contour the
ultra-violet limit ru v  0 can be taken explicitly by extending the rays to the origin.

using that f (s) = f (sa) for a = 

2() then amounts to

implies that c   s() and | arg(/s)k| > /2 which again makes the contour integral

we have then shown that: the infra-red limit of a physical quantity, fir, is the limiting
value of the borel transform of f (s), and changing the way in which the scale parameter
is introduced amounts to changing the order of the borel transform. the order k has to
satisfy the bound  > /k where  determines the analytic sector of the physical quantity
f (s).

one way of calculating the contour integral in (12) is to insert a series expansion
of f (s) around the origin, but because f (s) is only analytic in a sector this series can
only be an asymptotic expansion of f (s) 1. an analytic function has a unique asymptotic
expansion, but an asymptotic series might be the asymptotic expansion of several analytic

around the origin is convergent and equal to the power series of f (z); the lack of analyticity at the origin

functions. however in the case where a function is analytic in a sector of opening  > 
k ,
which is the situation we have above, the map between the analytic function and the
asymptotic series of order k is injective (but not surjective) [13]. this means that all
information about the exact function is contained in the asymptotic series.

pn

an asymptotic series of f (s) in the scale parameter can be obtained doing the per-
turbative expansion in the coupling and then inserting the running coupling constant.
assume that f is given as a formal perturbative series, which we write as f (s, g) =
fn(s)gn. the callan-symanzik equation states that a theory is invariant, i.e. the
correlators are invariant, under a scale transformation if the couplings change according
to the renormalisation group. a scaled quantum eld theory can therefore equivalently
be described by a theory on the same scale, but with couplings changed according to the
renormalisation group. in this way scale dependence of a theory can be moved into the
running coupling g(s). moving all scale dependence into the running coupling we get an

asymptotic series in the scale f (s = 1, g(s)) =p fnsn 2.

the examples we consider below have  =   , where   1, hence from the
constraint  > 
k : k = 1 +  for some  > 0. we will generally try to minimise the order k
(k  1), thus maximising the analytic sector and the convergence of the borel transform.

3 dening f (s) for the central charge

as the rst example we want to calculate the infra-red central charge of a 2 dimensional
unitary quantum eld theory. the renormalisation group ow of the central charge is
governed by zamolodchikovs c-theorem [4]. this states that for a unitary and renormal-
isable quantum eld theory in 2 dimensions there exists a function which is monotonically
decreasing along the renormalisation group ow, and which is stationary only for confor-
mally invariant theories where it takes the value of the virasoro central charge. the
c-theorem implies that the infra-red limit, where the scale goes to innity, and the ultra-
violet limit, where the scale vanishes, are xed points of the renormalisation group. in
2 dimensions scale invariance implies conformal invariance so in these scaling limits we
have a conformal eld theory characterised by the central charge.

we dene the energy-momentum tensor as in [2]

ht(x)i =

w [g]
g ,

(13)

2v

pg(x)

where v = vol(sn1) = 2 in 2d and w [g] is the eective action.

the correlator htzz(z)tzz(0)i gives the ultra-violet and infra-red central charges in
the limits z  0 and z   respectively. in [2] ht(x)t(0)i was written using the

forces the asymptotic series to diverge. a formal power series f (z) =p fnzn is asymptotic of order k if

 c, k > 0 : |fn| < ck n(1 + n/k), this shows that the borel transform of order k, of such a series, has
a non zero convergence radius.

2if f (s) is asymptotic of order k ( f (s)  c[[s]]1/k ) we will choose k = k, and then the borel
transform of f has a non-zero convergence radius and the analytically continued value at innity uniquely
determines fir. the analytical continuation can be done by a conformal mapping, we will discuss this
in the appendix.

we will show that f (s) is an analytic continuation of f (x), x  r+, for s  s = s(  )

(with   1); to show this write f (s) =rm df (s, ). for f to be holomorphic in s then

f (s, ) must be holomorphic in s for all   m, and both f and df
over the set m. using (20) above we can write f (s) as

k(z) is holomorphic in s so f (s, ) is clearly holomorphic in s. the modied bessel
functions also satisfy that |k(z)| is bounded for |z|   for any   r+ and | arg z| <

which is the case for z = s when s  s. for large values of |s| integrability is ensured by
2z ez(1 + o(z1)).
around the origin k0(z)z  0 for z  0 and k1(z)z  1 for z  0, hence f (s) is
integrable. d f (s)
is shown to be integrable in a similar way and the analyticity is shown.
from the form of f (s) in (24) it follows that f (s) has a limit value f (s)  d for
s  0 from s. from (23) it follows that d = cu v , and we dene f (0) = cu v . it also
follows from (24) that f (s) has a limit value for |s|   from s: f (s)  d and (23)
again sets d = cir.

where in both cases the contribution from the cut is rapidly decreasing in . note that
in these relations the integral is performed in the opposite scaling limit of the quantity
we calculate. we will here concentrate on (25) as perturbation theory can be applied to
f (s) when s  c0, we will call iir() = i().

5when we set |z| = 1 then  becomes dimensionless in (20), we also denote this dimensionless quantity

by .

we can choose coordinates in the coupling constant space so that the ultra-violet xed
point corresponds to g(s) = 0. in the ultra-violet limit where s  0 we may describe
f (s) by perturbation theory as g(s)  0. the nth order perturbative approximation of
f (s) is denoted by fn(s) and the corresponding integral by in(). in the limit of large 
the contribution from the cut vanishes and we get

cir  lim


in() = lim
s

fn(s)

(27)

where the last equality follows setting s = s/ in (25) and then taking the limit   
in the integrand valid for all ru v > 0. moving all scale dependence into the running
coupling g(s) we can write fn(s) = n(g(s)). let g
ir denote the rst non trivial zero of
the perturbative function, i.e. g(s)  g

ir for s  . then equation (27) becomes

lim

fn(s) = lim
s

n(g(s)) = n(g

ir) = c

(28)

which is the perturbative estimate of cir we want to improve.

fn(s) is the ultra-violet perturbative approximation to f (s) and the integration range
in i() is compact so lim0 in() = lim0 i() = cu v . in() therefore provides a good
approximation to i(), for small enough , since the power series expansion of i() is
controlled by the small s expansion of f (s) for which perturbation theory applies. this
is illustrated in (62) below for the minimal models. for larger values of  higher order
terms in the expansion of in() become important and the coecients of the expansion
of in() and fn() part company. if cir < c
ir and if the region where in() is a good
approximation to i() is large enough, then in() will have a minimum before approaching
its limiting value of c
ir. since this minimum occurs at the largest value of  for which
in() is a reasonable approximation to i() and the true value of cir is given by i(),
it is this minimum of in() that we will use to provide a better estimate of cir. the
approximation then becomes

cir = in(m)

(29)

where m is the value where in() attains its minimum. below we consider the quantity
cexact = cu v  cir and denote the approximation to it capprox = cu v  in(m), we call
the perturbative value cpert = cu v  lim in() = cu v  c
ir. this approximation
rests upon the assumption that the exact function is monotonically decreasing from cu v
to cir, or at least that its minimum value is close to cir. below we will show that this is
indeed the case for k = 4, at least to a very good approximation.

3.3 exact bound on c

as discussed above can the exact value i() possibly be smaller than the asymptotic
value cir. we will denote by 
m the value where i() attains its minimum and cest =
cu v  i(
m), then cexact  cest measures the undershoot of the exact function i()
compared with its asymptotic value cir (see gure 3). from the spectral representation
of f (s) in (24) we can obtain a rigorous lower bound on this exact undershoot. in [2] it
was shown that the spectral density can be written as

c(2) = cir(2) + c(2),

the lower bound in the relative undershoot of i(
in
gure 2 we plot () for k = 4. with this value we get that min () = 0.0232 so the
relative overshoot in cest compared with cexact is maximally 2.3%. it follows from (31)
that the bound in (32) is only saturated for free theories (where c(2)  (2  m2)) for
general interacting theories will the relative overshoot be smaller than | min ()|.

m) therefore equals min ().

we show in gure 3 the type of behaviour that we expect and which is conrmed for

the minimal models below.

the actual choice of k = 4 then is a compromise between maximising the range of

analyticity (small k) and minimising the undershoot in i(

m) (large k).

4 application to dierent 2d models

in this section we calculate the central charge for the free bosonic and fermionic theory
perturbed by a mass term. these theories are gaussian and we can calculate f (s) exactly,
the central charge can then be written as lim i() as the contribution from the cut
then vanishes. the infra-red limit of these theories is trivial (cir = 0) as all the degrees of
freedom are massive, and therefore decouple when approaching the infra-red xed point
where the scale goes to innity. the free theories are none the less important to consider
as we can here obtain the exact function i().

in 4.3 we consider the unitary minimal models perturbed by the relevant operator
(1,3), this theory has a non-trivial infra-red xed point. we obtain the renormalisation
group improved perturbative calculation of cir and compare with the approximation (29).

4.1 the free boson

we take the action for the free bosonic theory in 2 dimensions with a mass m to be

s =z d2x (cid:18)1

2

(x)(x) +

1
2

m22(x)(cid:19) .

(33)

the perturbation away from the conformal eld theory is thus given by the purely massive
term 1
2m22. the theory is still a free theory o criticality and the correlator ht t i can
be calculated exactly in the whole scaling region from the ultra-violet to the infra-red.
with this normalisation the energy-momentum tensor becomes

t (z, z) = tzz(z, z) = 2 : (z, z)(z, z) :

with the correlator

ht (z, z)t (w, w)i = (2)2h: (z, z)(z, z) : : (w, w)(w, w) :i

= 2(2)2h(z, z)(w, w)i2,

(34)

(35)

as only the double contractions survive. using the form (19) of the free propagator then
(35) is 2(zzk0(m|z|))2 where we have set w = 0 using translation invariance. we now

12

use the identities k 
and (35) becomes

n =  1

2 (kn1 + kn+1), k2(x) = k0(x) + 2

x k1(x), k1(x) = k1(x)

ht (z, z)t (0, 0)i =

m2|z|2

8z4

hence f (s) with k = 4 becomes

1 (m|z|) + m2|z|2k 2

(cid:0)4k 2

0 (m|z|) + 4m|z|k1(m|z|)k0(m|z|)(cid:1) ,

1 (ms1/4) + m2k 2

0 (ms1/4) +

4m

s1/4 k0(ms1/4)k1(ms1/4)(cid:19) .

knowing f (s) exactly the central charges follow from (23) directly, but let us use the
relations (26), (25) in the limit of large  where the cut vanishes. for cu v we substitute
s = ms1/4,  = 

m4 in the contour c2. from (26) we then get that (for rir = 1

m4 )

iu v () =

0 (ei) + 4eik0(ei)k1(ei)(cid:1) .

(36)

this is not expressible in terms of elementary functions, but it can be calculated using the
analytical properties of the bessel functions. the integration contour can be collapsed
into a contour running along the imaginary axis together with an innitesimal semi-circle
around the origin. setting ix = ei we then get the 3 contributions

dx(cid:19) ex2(cid:0)4xk1(ix)2 + x3k0(ix)2  4ix2k0(ix)k1(ix)(cid:1) .

for    only the contribution from the innitesimal semi-circle c survive and here
we can insert the asymptotic form for k1(z)  z1 and k0(z)   log z. in this limit
only the rst term with k 2
1 will contribute as is seen from the asymptotic form. taking
into account that we only integrate over half a circle we then get the well known result

cu v = 1

which is an exact result as the contribution from the cut vanishes in this limit6. to calcu-
late the infra-red central charge we use (27) hence cir = lim iir() = lims f (s).
using the asymptotic form of the modied bessel functions kn(x)  ex from (4.1) we
then get that cir = 0. figure 4 shows the exact function iu v () computed by a numerical
integration of (36) using a nag fortran library integration routine. the gure shows
how the contribution from the cut vanishes in the limit of large . the exact infra-red
function iir() is plotted in gure 5 it is important to note that the minimum value of
iir() is very small, namely 0.019.

4.2 the free fermion

the free massive fermion has the action

s =z d2x (cid:0)   +   + im (cid:1) .

(37)

6we could also directly have used the analogous of (27) namely lim iuv () = lims0 f (s) which
is again seen changing variable in (26) and taking the limit    in the integrand valid for all rir < .

(38)

the same arguments as above yields cu v = 1
2, and the infra-red contribution cir =
lims f (s) = 0, again by using the asymptotic form of the bessel functions. again
we can obtain the exact functions i() by a numerical computation. we get the same
behaviour of iir() as in the bosonic case, but with the minimum value 0.0048, so this
exact function does again not dier much from the infra-red central charge at its minimum
value.

4.3 the unitary minimal models

the o critical quantum eld theory picks out a specic renormalisation group ow from
the ultra-violet to the infra-red conformal eld theory. if the quantum eld theory is in the
neighbourhood of one of the renormalisation group xed points  in coupling constant
space (we may be choose the coordinates so  = 0 corresponds to the ultra-violet cft)
the action can be written as

s = scf t +

n

xi=1

iz d2x i(x).

(39)

here the i(x)s are scaling elds with scaling dimension i, the coupling constants
i then have mass dimension [i] = 2  i = yi. from (39) it follows that yi is the
renormalisation group eigenvalue of the scaling elds i. for renormalisable quantum
eld theories we need yi  0 and the scaling operators therefore have to be relevant
(y > 0) or marginal (y = 0). for relevant operators we will move away from the xed
point when the scale increases and scf t thus corresponds to an ultra-violet critical point.
we consider quantum eld theories which have the unitary minimal models m(m) as

their scaling limits. the central charge for m(m) is given by

c(m) = 1 

6

m(m + 1)

, m = 3, 4, . . .

there are m(m  1)/2 primary elds

(p,q) = (mp,mq+1),

1  p  m  1, 1  q  m,

with the conformal dimensions

h(p,q) = h(p,q) =

((m + 1)p  mq)2  1

4m(m + 1)

,

(40)

(41)

so the primary elds are scalars (spin zero). it follows from (41) that 2(m  2) of the
primary elds satisfy  = 2h < 2 and are thus relevant operators 7. we will consider the
minimal models perturbed by the relevant operator (1,3) given by the action

s = sm(m)  0z d2x (1,3)(x).

(42)

7as the secondary elds will have a conformal dimension of at least h + 1 there will be no relevant

secondary elds.

15

m+1 < 1, which exists in all m(m).

the reasons for choosing this operator are that:
i) (1,3) is a relevant eld, h(1,3) = 1  2
ii) (m,n) form an algebra under the operator product expansion, from the fusion rules
of minimal models it follows that the set (1,n) constitutes a sub-algebra in which only
(1,1), (1,2) and (1,3) are relevant as seen from (41). (1,3) is normalised so that the
structure constant c(1,3)(1,3)(1,1) = 1 where i = (1,1) = (m1,m) is the identity, and it has
the self coupling c(1,3)(1,3)(1,3) = b(m). it does not couple to (1,2) so it has no coupling
to other relevant operators in the sub-algebra (1,n) [8, 9, 10]. this means that there is
a renormalisation group ow connecting the ultra-violet and infra-red xed points along
8, i.e. it
the direction of (1,3) so it is consistent to include only the one relevant eld (1,3)
is a geodesic renormalisation group trajectory [7].
iii) (1,3) is the least relevant eld, and the perturbation in (42) becomes marginal in the
limit of m   as y = 4
m+1 so that y  0. in this limit the xed points are arbitrarily
close in coupling constant space, and perturbation theory is viable in the whole region
from the ultra-violet to the infra-red.

we want to calculate the dierence between the ultra-violet and the infra-red central
charge c = cu v  cir. it has been argued that the infra-red conformal eld theory of
(42) is given by the unitary minimal model m(m  1), as c in the perturbative limit
y  0 is given by c = 3

16y3 + o(y4) [8, 9], and from (40) we get that

c(m)  c(m  1) =

12

m(m2  1)

=

3y3

2(2  y)(4  y)

=

3y3
16

+ o(y4).

(43)

a general argument for all m has been given by a thermodynamic bethe ansatz method
in [11]9. we now describe how c is calculated using our approximation method, and we
will compare this with the exact result cexact = c(m)  c(m  1).

to construct the term ht (z, z)t (0, 0)i we use the ward identities which follow from

euclidean invariance

zht (z, z)1(x1)    n(xn)i +

1

and in a renormalisable eld theory  must belong to the space spanned by the relevant

8this can be seen by writing the zamolodchikov metric in normal coordinates around the ultra-
violet xed point g = 0, gij = ij + o(g2), the beta-functions becomes in these coordinates i(g) =

in [1] we used k = 2/y = (m + 1)/2, but here we have chosen k = 4 as we then get a
stricter bound on the exact function as explained in section 3.3. the results for k = 2/y

the improvement of the approximation (29) over the rg improved perturbative result is

if we choose the maximum value k = 1 we get results which are almost identical to
the exact values, we denote these by capprox2, and plot in gure 8 cexact and capprox2

strict bound on the exact function i() as for the case with k = 4 described in section 3.3.
the exact function might still have a very small undershoot if for example the smallest non
zero mass of a one particle state is small compared with

because the approximation is based on only a one loop calculation.

5 critical exponents for 4 in 3 dimensions

the other example we will consider is 4 theory in 3 dimensions with o(n) symmetry12.
we will study the ising (n = 1) case in detail here, but the method applies for a general
n. quantum eld theories have generic infra-red divergences in dimensions lower than
4, for 4 theory this can be seen by studying the 1pi 2 point function [14]. a way of
regulating these infra-red divergences is to either do an  expansion in  = 4  d, or work
with a massive theory. we will here do the latter, and work in d = 3 following [15]. we
introduce the renormalised eld, mass and coupling according to the conventions in [16]
so the renormalised elds r are given as:  = (z1)1/2r, 2 = z2(2)r and m, g denotes
the renormalised mass and coupling. the infra-red divergences are now removed and only
show up in the bare correlators as non analytic dependence in the bare coupling [15]. we
will calculate two of the infra-red critical exponents  and , all other exponents follow
from scaling relations13, e.g. fishers scaling relation  = (2  ).

the free 2 point correlator, or propagator, is given as

g0(p, m) =z ddx eipxh(x)(0)i =

1

p2 + m2 .

(63)

the mass is related to the critical temperature  as   m2, so that the free propagator
can be written as

g0(p, ) = h( p

 )
where h is regular at the origin and  = 1 and  = 1
2 . this scaling behaviour generalises to
the interacting theory with critical exponents  and , hence from the scaling relations all
critical exponents can be obtained from the propagator. we will now dene the function
f (s) above for respectively  and , and show that they are analytic in some sector with
the correct scaling limits.

(64)

using that the massless theory for small momentum (infra-red region) is equivalent to
the large momentum region at g = gc [15] it follows from the callan-symanzik equation for
the renormalised propagator that in the limit of small momentum it scales as g(p)  1
p2 ,
hence dening

12this model is one of the most studied models in critical phenomena and it is important because it
shares its infra-red xed point with a number of physical models, such as: polymers (n = 0), the ising
model (n = 1), super-uid bose-liquid (n = 2) and the heisenberg ferromagnet (n = 3).

13the calculation of the critical exponents in 4 theory are among the most precise calculations in
quantum eld theory, and they have been calculated using both the  expansion, exact renormalisation
group arguments, perturbative quantum eld theory, high temperature expansions and monte carlo
simulations. these exponents describe the scaling behaviour of the theory in the scaling region and are
universal in the sense that they are only determined by the infra-red xed point and are therefore identical
for all quantum eld theories owing to this point under the renormalisation group, irrespective of the
underlying microscopic dynamics.

the functions f(g) and f(g) have been calculated up to an amazing 7 loops in the

where the beta-function has been calculated up to 6-loops [18]. the perturbative series
for 4 theory was in [19] shown to be borel summable in the coupling of order k = 1, so
we set f (s) = f (s1). in [20] it was shown using the idea from [21] that the coecients of

the perturbative green functions f (g) =pn fngn for large n are given as

fn = c(b)n(1 + bl + n)(1 + o(1/n))

(75)

where b, bl, c were calculated in [20, 22]. b = 0.14777422 and it follows that the convergence
radius of the borel transform of f (g) is given by bs = 1/b with a singularity at 1/b. when
bl > 0 we want to perform a borel-leroy transform of order k, which replaces a formal

series f =pn fnzn with pn(fn/(1 + bl + n/k)zn. instead of (12) we then dene

(76)

i() =

(1 + bl)

this function will then have the limits lim i() = fir and lim0 i() = fu v as
before.

we introduce the scale parameter s via the exact running coupling g(s) (s  0 in the
ultra-violet) then we know that f(g(s)) and f(g(s)) are asymptotic series in g(s). we
now approximate the exact running coupling g(s) with the solution to

s

dgn(s)

ds

= n(gn)

(77)

with the boundary condition g
n(0) = 1, where n(g) is the perturbative  function to the
nth order. f(gn(s)), f(gn(s)) are then asymptotic series in s, which we will write as

fj(s) =pl(fj)lsl for j = , . the borel-leroy transform given by (76) becomes

n+1

i(, bl, k) =

(78)

as we are only working with a truncated series we will set k = 1 (only innitesimally
dierent from k = 1 + ,   1), note we are summing up to n + 1 as the nth order 
function has n + 1 terms, and fj are known to the (n + 1)th order.

24

to nd the critical exponents ,  we will here do an analytical continuation in the
borel transform (which we do by a conformal mapping) followed by a pade approximation.
the details of this calculation are given in the appendix. we get the following estimates15

and

 = 0.625  0.004

 = 0.0315  0.0020.

(79)

(80)

these numbers should be compared with  = 0.6304  0.0013 [17],  = 0.6300  0.0015
[23],  = 0.6290  0.0025 ( expansion [17]),  = 0.6289  0.0008 (monte carlo) and for
the other exponent  = 0.0355  0.0025 [17],  = 0.032  0.003 [23],  = 0.0360  0.0050
( expansion [17]),  = 0.0374  0.0014 (monte carlo), all these numbers are taken from
[17].

in the usual evaluation one determines the value of the critical coupling gc and then
evaluates the re-summed series at this point. the values then becomes very dependent
on the estimate of gc. one advantage of our method is that we do not have to estimate
gc, likewise we do not have to perform the laplace integral, but instead the critical point
is reached taking the limit in the borel transform. the disadvantage of this method is
that we do not have specic knowledge of the quantities rc, bl governing the asymptotic
behaviour for the transformed series in the scale parameter.
in the usual case of the
perturbative expansion in the coupling these parameters are obtained from estimates of
the higher order behaviour of perturbation theory.

6 conclusion

we have described a general method of obtaining the infra-red limit of a physical quantity
as an integral in the ultra-violet region. this was done using the analytic structure of
green functions in a complex scale parameter and by moving all scale dependence into
the running coupling. the infra-red limit is then given as the limiting value of the borel
transform in the scale of the physical quantity. changing the way in which the scale is
introduced amounts to changing the order in the borel transform.

we have tested this on two examples where the infra-red limit is well known, namely
for the central charge of the perturbed unitary minimal models and the critical exponents
of 4 theory in three dimensions. for the perturbed minimal models we showed how an
approximation method can be obtained for calculating the central charge, and we get
approximations close to the exact values already at one loop by using the largest domain
of analyticity implied by spectral decomposition. for the 4 theory our estimates of the
critical exponents are within the errors of other, more elaborate approximations.

15the errors obtained could be lowered e.g. using one of the techniques from [23] or as in [25] using
the information about the pole at rc to obtain an extra order in the pade table, but the aim here has not
been to get a very low error, but to apply the method described above to a well known example.

25

a pade approximation

the borel transform is analytic in a sector s() where   1 [13]. the series given by
(78) will have a pole at the negative real axis for some value  = rc (rc > 0) determining
its convergence radius. we will now analytically continue i() given by (78) doing the
conformal transformation (as in [14])

t =



rc + 

,  / (, rc],

 =

rct
1  t

,

(81)

so that i(t, bl) = i( rct
series

1t, bl). if we write (78) as i() = pl ill then i(t) is given by the

i(t) =

n+1

xl=1

il tl, il =

l

xm=1

imrm

m  1(cid:19).
c (cid:18) l  1

(82)

if all poles of i() lies in (, rc], as argued in [23, 14], then i(t) given by this series
is convergent for t  [0, 1). we want to evaluate this expression at the convergence
radius t = 1 (where i(t) is regular), to do this we will use pade approximants [24,
25].
in pade approximation a function is approximated by a rational function, called
[l/m], with polynomials of degree l and m in the numerator and denominator (and the
constant in the denominator is 1). if the n rst terms of the function is known then these
coecients are matched with the coecients of the polynomials where 0 < l + n  n.
one then forms the pade table with entries [l/m]. the pade approximation is based on
the conjecture that there is a subsequence of diagonal pade approximants [l/l] which
converge uniformly to the function, and this conjecture has shown to hold in practice.
the diagonal pade approximants are conformally invariant and are therefore independent
of rc above. generally we should use pade approximants close to the diagonal. note
that according to the pade conjecture one should still expect convergence of the pade
approximants even if there are a nite number of poles within |t| < 1, which is the case
if not all poles of i() are in (, rc].

we also have to determine the values of rc and bl. let us rst note that from the

n(0) = 1 we have that gn(s) = s + o(s2) and in fj(s) = pl(fj)lsl

boundary condition g
we thus have that (fj)l = ( fj)l +    where ( fj)l is the lth coecient of g in fj(g),
this means that the convergence radius of the transformed series cannot be larger than
the convergence radius of the series in the coupling g, i.e. 0 < rc  bs = 1/b. also we
would suspect that bl  b
l is the leroy parameter of the series in g. if bl is
chosen too large we will divide by more than the actual asymptotic increase in (82) and
the approximation value will be to small, if bl is chosen too small we expect to get a poor
convergence in the pade table. in the same way we expect the approximate value to be
too small if rc is chosen smaller than the actual convergence radius because the values we
are calculating are increasing from zero. this is the behaviour we see in the tables and
we estimate rc and bl to be respectively the largest and smallest value so that there is
convergence in the pade table.

l, where b

from the asymptotic form of the  function (75) it follows that it is alternating,
l=1 fl is to use the
fl where fl = fl for l < n and fn = fn/2 [26]. we have also obtained the

using the criteria mentioned above, for the choice of rc, bl we get the following pade

for the function f(s) leading to f,ir = 0.402 0.007, where the error is the inter-tabular
error for the points chosen (which is here larger than the baker-hunter error [28]), and
rc = bs, bl = 2.4. using the  function with 1/2 times the last coecient we get the pade

giving f,ir = 0.404 0.004, again with rc = bs and bl = 2.4. averaging over these two we
get for the critical exponent  = 0.626  0.003. at this value of bl and rc we have the best
convergence in the pade table, a more conservative estimate of f,ir is obtained by varying
rc and bs in a region around these values and then sample the highest and lowest value
for which there is some convergence in the pade table17. this gives f,ir = 0.40  0.01
leading to

 = 0.625  0.004.

(85)

for the other exponent  we get approximately the same pade tables using either the
-function as given in (74) or with a half times the last term, the convergent pade table
becomes

and we obtain the critical exponent  = 0.0319  0.0010, where rc = bs and bl = 1.8.
again varying around these values gives the estimate

 = 0.0315  0.0020.

(87)

16the numbers marked with a * has a pole close to or in the interval (0, 1).
17this variation also have to be performed when expanding in the coupling as the asymptotic behaviour
might not have been reached for the low number of terms available. in [27] it was argued that the results
evaluated using borel-leroy transforms were very stable under variation of bl and bs in a wide range
around the exact asymptotic values, and we see similar behaviour here.
