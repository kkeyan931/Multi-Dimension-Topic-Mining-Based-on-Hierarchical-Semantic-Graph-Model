abstract

the trace anomaly in external gravity is the sum of three terms at criticality: the square of the weyl
tensor, the euler density and r, with coecients, properly normalized, called c, a and a, the latter

being ambiguously dened by an additive constant. unitarity and positivity properties of the induced
actions allow us to show that the total rg ows of a and a are equal and therefore the a-ambiguity
can be consistently removed through the identication a = a. the picture that emerges claries several
long-standing issues. the interplay between unitarity and renormalization implies that the ux of the
renormalization group is irreversible. a monotonically decreasing a-function interpolating between the
appropriate values is naturally provided by a. the total a-ow is expressed non-perturbatively as the
invariant (i.e. scheme-independent) area of the graph of the beta function between the xed points. we
test this prediction to the fourth loop order in perturbation theory, in qcd with nf . 11/2 nc and in
supersymmetric qcd. there is agreement also in the absence of an interacting xed point (qed and
4-theory). our arguments do not seem to prove that a is strictly positive, but put a lower bound to
its value.

introduction

anomalies are often calculable to high orders in perturbation theory with a relatively moderate
eort. sometimes they are calculable exactly to all orders.

much of the present knowledge about the low-energy limit of asymptotically free quan-
tum eld theories comes from anomalies, via the adlerbardeen theorem [1]. conserved axial
currents have one-loop exact anomalies and the t hooft anomaly matching conditions [2] put
constraints on the low-energy limit of the theory.

a second class of anomalies, related to the stress tensor, called central charges, do not satisfy
the adlerbardeen theorem. nevertheless, they obey various positivity constraints, which also
put restrictions on the low-energy limit of the theory.

other remarkable positivity constraints are those obeyed by the spectrum of anomalous
dimensions of the quantum conformal algebra, i.e.
the algebra generated by the operator
product expansion of the stress tensor. applications of the nachtmann theorem [3] reveal non-
trivial properties of strongly coupled conformal eld theories [4, 5], especially in the presence
of supersymmetry, where the algebraic structure simplies considerably.

furthermore, in supersymmetric theories, the two classes of anomalies mentioned above,
axial and trace, are related to each other, and the adlerbardeen theorem can be used to
compute the exact ir values of the central charges in the conformal window [6]. the consequent
large class of restrictions on the low-energy limit of the theory can be studied explicitly [7].

there are positivity properties of the central charges that have not been rigorously proved,

yet. the purpose of this paper is to clarify certain long-standing issues in this context.

the trace anomaly of the energy-momentum tensor is deeply related to the renormalization
group ow. there is empirical evidence [6, 7] that a central charge, called a, is positive and
takes greater values in the uv than in the ir: auv  air  0. the quantity a is interpreted
as the number of massless degrees of freedom of the theory. this means that the ux of the
renormalization group is irreversible.

we call this notion quantum irreversibility, to distinguish it from time irreversibility, proper

of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

a rst suggestion in favour of this idea comes from two-dimensional quantum eld theory,
where zamolodchikov [8] proved that the central extension c of the stress tensor operator
product algebra is positive and monotonically decreasing along the renormalization group ow.
a four-dimensional generalization of this property is, however, more dicult to prove. in
four dimensions, for example, the set of candidate central charges is richer, and among them
there is also the central extension c of the operator product algebra. various proposals for the
good candidate have appeared in the literature, as well as attempts to prove the irreversibility
property. we do not review the history of this research here, but one proposal, due to cardy
[9], deserves special mention, since the results of [6] were able to reject all the other candidates,
in particular the central extension c of the ope algebra. at the same time, the impressive
amount of evidence in favour of the a-theorem [6, 7] convinced many people that quantum
irreversibility was true.

2

in this paper we reconsider the matter under a dierent viewpoint. we present a general
picture that claries various issues related with the trace anomaly and unies some notions
that have been so far considered unrelated. quantum irreversibility is intrinsically contained
in this picture, and the outcome is an explicit non-perturbative formula for the total ow of a
that can be tested successfully to the fourth loop order in perturbation theory. this formula
gives an intuitive (and geometrical) picture of quantum irreversibility, measured by the area of
the graph of the beta function.

in the rest of the introduction we give the basic guidelines of our arguments, anticipate
some applications, and explain how the paper is structured. the presentation is meant to be
self-consistent and we take this opportunity to discuss the same issue under dierent viewpoints.

the last term of (1.1) is written, for concreteness, in the case of yangmills theory.

in

general it should read pi ioi, where the sum runs over the set of coupling constants of the
theory.
in the presence of scalar elds  there is an additional complication, which has to
be treated apart, due to the renormalization mixing between the stress-energy tensor and the
operator (   ) 2,  = diag(1,1,1,1). arguments and conclusions are valid for
the most general renormalizable quantum eld theory.
the term r2 does not contribute at criticality, since it is neither a total derivative nor a
conformal-invariant. for this reason one can factorize a () in its coecient, which multiplies
a certain function h().

the tilde over the functions c(), a() and a() is used to remark that these functions,
as they appear in the anomaly operator equation, have not a direct physical meaning at a
generic energy scale (see the discussion in section 1 of ref.
[12] for all details). in particular,
they are scheme-dependent. physical quantities have to be dened via matrix elements of
operators rather than the operator equations. an operator equation contains artefacts that
disappear in matrix elements.

contributions coming from the matrix elements of the dynamical operator

elements of operators. in ref. [12] this was done for the function c() and certain secondary
in the rst part of the paper we extend this analysis to the function a()
central charges.
and prove that it satises the irreversibility property.
in the rest of the paper we explain
how this interpolating function is also a good central function for a(), so that a satises the
irreversibility property as well (the a-theorem, see [6]).

reection positivity implies

c  0,

since c is the overall constant of the stress tensor two-point function, whose structure is uniquely
xed by conformality at the xed points. at the ope level [4, 5] c represents the central
extension of the quantum conformal algebra, which is the reason why we retain the symbol
c for it. it has been shown, even at the non-perturbative level [6] in the conformal window,
that the central extension is not, in general, the quantity that monotonically decreases along
the rg ow: this is true only in two dimensions. following [6] we use a dierent symbol
for the decreasing quantity, a, and speak of a-theorem. at the level of ope algebra, the
interpretation of the quantity a is dierent from that in two dimensions [5]: the combination
1  a/c is indeed a structure constant of the ope algebra.

there are cases, also in four dimensions, where the central extension does decrease from the
uv to the ir, for example when the theory interpolates between conformal xed points with
c = a. these conformal eld theories have a simplied ope algebra and other nice properties
[4, 5]. c decreases in several other particular models, or in part of the conformal window.
examples of this kind are treated in [6, 7]. nevertheless, this behaviour is not general and so
the central extension is not a good counter of the massless degrees of freedom of the system.

the quantity a has been shown to have the desirable properties, namely

auv  air  0,

(1.3)

in various concrete models, the most impressive results being the exact formulas of [6] for the
conformal windows in supersymmetric theories, applied in [7] to a large variety of cases. o the
conformal window, non-perturbative tests based on general physical grounds in qcd [9] and on
various duality conjectures in supersymmetric theories [13] are successful, but less constraining,
since c passes them also. at the rigorous level, both proofs that a is positive and decreasing
along the rg ow have been missing. positivity of a passes the tests of [6, 7] within the known
conformal windows. the breakdown of this condition typically signals that the ir xed point
does not exist (as in pure n=1 supersymmetric qcd).

finally, the quantity a has remained, up to now, somewhat mysterious, especially at crit-
icality; yet it is simple to prove that it is monotonically decreasing from the uv to the ir.
there exists a central function a(t) = a[(t)] that satises the irreversibility property at any

4

intermediate energy scale,

da(t)/dt  0;

nevertheless, as it stands, a is not a good counter of degrees of freedom, since it is meaningless at
criticality. one of the purposes of our analysis is to clarify the meaning of a and its relationship
with the other two quantities, in particular the quantity a.

we see that each of the three quantities has part of the properties that we would like for a
single quantity: c is positive, but not monotonically decreasing; a is monotonically decreasing,
but ill-dened at criticality; a has the good properties, but so far only at the empirical level, in
the sense that they have not been proved rigorously. it is only by uncovering the deep meaning
of each quantity and the interplay among them that a clarifying picture can emerge. we can
say that the matter is much simpler in two dimensions, because, in some sense, c = a = a.
the proof of irreversibility [8] and positivity are straightforward in two dimensions.

in some works [14] one nds arguments in favour of the identication a = 3c. this is how-
ever an artefact of the regularization scheme (a dimensional continuation preserving conformal
invariance in d-dimensions) and is actually inconsistent. indeed, if this equality were consistent,
it would hold both in the uv limit and the ir limit. however, a is monotonically decreasing,
while c has an indenite behaviour, as proved in [6]. there are many known examples where
auv = 3 cuv does not imply air = 3 cir.

therefore, if the ambiguous quantity a has to be identied with one of the two unambiguous
central charges, or a linear combination of them, it can only be identied with a. the relative
factor can be chosen in such a way that the relation a = a has other noticeable properties.
in particular the induced action for the conformal factor (the riegert action [15]) simplies
enormously (it becomes free as in two dimensions).

considerations about positivity of induced eective actions (absence of negatively normed
states) allow us to show that the identication a = a is consistent, i.e. that if assumed in the
uv limit of the theory it holds also in the ir limit, precisely

auv  air = auv  air.

(1.4)

the ambiguity of the quantity a can be resolved by xing auv = auv. then (1.4) implies
air = air. therefore, according to the above observations, one can dene a monotonically
decreasing physical function a[(t)] at all intermediate energies, whose values coincide with
the values of a at the critical points.
irreversibility is the result of the interplay between
unitarity and renormalization.

the same considerations, however, do not seem to prove that a is strictly positive, but are

sucient to put a lower bound on it.

from the identication a = a, a simple non-perturbative formula expressing the total rg
ow of a as the invariant area of the graph of the beta function follows (here invariant area
means scheme-independent). this formula can be checked in perturbation theory, to the fourth
loop order included, in all renormalizable models.

using our results, a notion of proper coupling constant  can be dened, which is the
coupling constant for which the zamolodchikov metric is constant throughtout the renormal-

5

ization group ow. the total ows of a and a equal the area of the graph of the proper beta
function (i.e. the beta function for ) between the xed points. this area is quantized in qcd.
in general, one can say that a universal unit-area cell is assigned to each massless degree of
freedom.

the paper is organized into two main parts. the rst part (section 2) is devoted to the
interpolating function for a, the second part (section 3) to the removal of its ambiguity, through
the relationship with a.

other implications are presented in the nal part of the paper and the conclusions.

in
particular, we discuss the induced action for the conformal factor (the riegert action) and
show that our identication a = a reduces it to a free action at criticality. moreover, we derive
an expression for the vacuum energy e0.

a comment on the claimed irreversibility is in order. the statement is about the intrinsic
irreversible character of the ux of the renormalization group. by intrinsic we mean proper
to the dynamical scale  introduced by renormalization. the desired eect has to be suitably
cleaned from spurious eects of dierent nature, that can either enhance or spoil the property
in a trivial way. for this reason we consider the most general renormalizable theory with no
mass parameter. a mass would trivially enhance the theorem, by killing degrees of freedom in
the ir, without modifying the uv. instead, a non-renormalizable interaction would trivially
spoil the theorem, by killing degrees of freedom in the uv, without modifying the ir. even
the non-perturbative eects of qcd, such as chiral symmetry breaking, enhance the theorem,
so that the crucial region for testing the intrinsic irreversibility of the rg ow is precisely the
conformal window.

2 the quantity a: ambiguity, irreversibility,

interpolating function

the quantity a is known to be ambiguous by an arbitrary additive constant. a regularization
technique can often hide this ambiguity and give an apparently unambiguous result for a. for
example, in [14], a is related to c. a general calculation can be found in [10], with relevant
comments in the concluding paragraph. this ambiguity, related to the addition of an arbitrary

niter r2-term in the induced eective action, does not spoil the a-physical content completely.

for example, the a-rg ow is unambiguously dened; a is like an additional coupling constant
of the theory. once it is normalized at a reference energy scale, it is xed at any other energy
scale. positive deniteness of the induced eective action for the conformal factor imposes
nevertheless a bound on a (see section 3.2).

for a free theory with ns real scalar elds, nf dirac fermions, and nv vector elds, we have
[14]

cfree = ns + 6nf + 12nv,

afree = ns + 11nf + 62nv,

(2.6)

while afree remains for the moment undetermined. for the central charges we use over-all
normalizations dierent from those of ref.
[6] and the previous literature, in order to have
integer valued quantities at the free critical points.

the operator  is associated with the conformal factor  of the metric, g = e2 . w
does not depend on , while the euler density depends on  quadratically. instead, the term r

contains a linear term in the conformal factor  around at space, r = 6 e2(cid:2) + ()2(cid:3).
therefore, the two-point function of  is proportional to the number a

 = 0. using  = e4s/ we have

2.1 generalities about the a-function

we now consider the o-critical theory. we can dene a function a(r) of the intermediate
energy scale 1/r by restricting the integration over a four-sphere s(r, y) of radius r and centred
at the point y, precisely

a(r2)  a(r1) = 

15

2z s(r2,y)

s(r1,y)

d4x |x  y|4h(x) (y)i.

(2.9)

the notation means that the integral is performed in the region contained between the two
four-spheres. unless dierently specied, correlators are in the euclidean framework. our
formula (2.9) does not give the critical values

auv = lim
r0

a(r),

air = lim
r

a(r)

of the function a, which are related to the ambiguity already mentioned. nevertheless, we
prove in this paper that there is also a universal way to remove it.

for a critical theory we have, from formula (2.7), auv = air = a(r) = a


running of a(r) is due to the internal term 
(1.1) for . its eect is a non-local term in the correlator h(x) (y)i, which we write as

. o-criticality, the
4 f 2 appearing in the operator anomaly equation

h(x) (y)i =

|x  y|8

,

for x 6= y.

(2.10)

the function f (t) has nite uv and ir limits. the regularity of the function f (t) at criticality
follows from the very denition of the -function and the operator f 2: the coecients of
the operators oi (i.e. the -functions) are precisely the zeros of  in the operator equation
 = ioi (for example  = 
4 f 2). the proof can be found in the classical works by adler,
collins and duncan [16], nielsen [17] and collins, duncan and joglekar [18]. from this very fact
it follows, among the other things, that at criticality the anomalous dimension of the operator
f 2 coincides with the slope 
of the -function [19]. for our purposes, we just need that the

function f [(t)] be bounded and non-vanishing at both critical points.

reection positivity [20] of the correlator (2.10) at x 6= y points assures that

f (t)  0.
now, let us insert (2.10) into (2.9). we obtain

a(r)  auv =

the integral is convergent1 [22]. around the uv xed point (which we assume to be free for

concreteness) we have   ,   1/t, f  const., and auv  air  r dt/t2 convergent for
large t. around the ir xed point we have   
> 0. solving the renormalization

group equation, we nd   etir 
 [19]. as expected, convergence is much faster around the
ir xed point, where it is exponential. in ref. [22], zee shows that convergence holds also when
  (  )n, n > 1.

(ir), 


the monotonically decreasing behaviour of the function a(r) is evident:

da(t)

dt

= 2(t)f (t)  0.

summarizing, the integral expressing the total ow is convergent, if there exists an ir xed
point ir <  and it can be interpreted as the area of the graph spanned by the beta function
between the xed points. since the -function depends on the subtraction scheme, while the
area in question must be scheme independent, the integral has to be performed with a suitable
metric, an ein-bein that restores scheme invariance. this metric is precisely the function
f ().

an alternative expression

for later convenience it is useful to re-express the correlator (2.10) in a slightly dierent way,
namely

h(x) (y)i =

4
45

1

(4)4

2 2[(t)] f [(t)]

|x  y|4

!

for x 6= y.

(2.14)

the above factorization of 2 comes naturally, for example, if one writes the stress tensor
two-point function as in formula (1.1) of ref. [12]. one has

2(t)f (t) =

1

192(cid:18) d

dt  2(cid:19)(cid:18) d

dt  4(cid:19)2(cid:18) d

dt  6(cid:19) 2(t) f (t).

(2.15)

as far as positivity is concerned, we can safely cross the 2 and infer positivity of f by the
positivity of f . this can be proved via the following general argument. let v[(t)] and u[(t)]
be functions related by the equation

(cid:18) d
dt  n(cid:19) v[(t)] = u[(t)],

n being a positive integer. then we can prove that if u is positive, v is negative, and vice versa.
indeed, the solution of the dierential equation is

v [(t)] = z 

t

en(tt) u[(t)] dt.

1integrals like (2.8) are the matter-induced gravitational couplings.

x |x|2h(x) (0)i and r d4

x h(x) (0)i,
x |x|4h(x) (0)i are the induced cosmological constant, the induced newton
constant and an induced higher-derivative coupling, respectively [21]. as they stand, the rst two integrals,
however, are divergent [9, 22]. no statement can be made about the signs of the induced cosmological constant
x h(x) (0)i [9, 23]

r d4
and the newton constant [21, 22]. in particular, arguments for irreversibility based on r d4

specically, r d4

present several unresolved problems [9].

the arbitrary constant is xed by the requirement that nv + u = 0 (i.e. d/dt  0) at criticality.
this equality can be veried for, say, t   by writing

v [(t)] = z

the limit t  + is similar. dependence of v on (t) can be checked by taking the derivative
with respect to (t) :

d = [(t)]

.

in the last step we have used the equality

[(t)]



 ln (t)

= [(s)]



 ln (s)

for any t and s.

we nally observe that the equality nv + u = 0, holding at the xed points, assures that
u and v have the same behavior at criticality. in particular, u  2 implies v  2, which is
why we collect a 2 in front of f in (2.14). we conclude that f is positive and depends on the
running coupling constant.

some arguments work also for the case n = 0, if u tends to zero suciently fast at criticality.

in that case we can write

v [(t)] = v[()] z 

t

u[(t)] dt,

but there is no unambiguous way to x the additive constant, so that the sign of the function
v is in general not xed.

using (2.15) we can also write

air  auv = z +



dt 2(t) f (t),

(2.16)

since all the terms containing d

dt integrate straightforwardly to zero.

2.2 interpolation between the critical values

we now study the correlator (2.10) at x = y as well as |x  y| = , which we can write in the
form
|x  y|2(cid:19)# ,

|x  y|8 (cid:18) x  y

|x  y|2(cid:19)(cid:21) ,

(2.18)

let us rst discuss the singularities at x = y. it is easy to see that this correlator, in particular
the central non-local term, is well dened as a distribution. for the study of the divergent part,
we can ignore the overall 2. we have

z d4x u(x  y)

2(t) f (t)
|x  y|4 < 

for any regular bounded test function u. this means that the perturbative divergences sum
up and disappear once the cut-o is removed. this situation is common when dealing with
anomalies and, in general, evanescent operators [24]. certainly we can have information from
the perturbative divergences before removing the cut-o [10], but the nal correlator is conver-
gent.

note the -function at innity, that we include formally in (2.17), required by conformal
, so

invariance. when the theory is conformal the middle term vanishes and auv = air = a

that

which is indeed conformal-invariant. formula (2.17) expresses that auv and air are the small-
and large-distance limits of a(r), respectively, and the non-local term interpolates between the
two. for a running theory we have necessarily auv 6= air (actually auv > air). we would like
to describe this interpolation in more detail.

by performing a rescaling    we can prove the following limits:

again, these formulas have to be meant in the sense of distributions, so their proofs are

worked out by means of a test function. we have

for   , 0. in the case   0, formula (2.19) is recovered. on the other hand, in the limit
   the result (auv  air)u() is also in agreement with (2.20).

using (2.19) and (2.20) we see that, in the uv limit, (2.17) tends to formula (2.18) with
= auv. similarly (2.19) shows that, in the ir limit, (2.17) tends also to formula (2.18) with
= air. we have therefore proved that the correlator hi interpolates between the uv and

ir values of the coecient of the term r in the trace anomaly operator equation.

2.3 scheme independence in the presence of scalar elds

it is important that the function f depends only on the running coupling (t), i.e. that it
does not depend explicitly on (), as a consequence of the callansymanzik equations and

11

the niteness of the stressenergy tensor. however, it is well known that in the presence of
scalar elds  the stressenergy tensor is not truly nite [25, 12]. it mixes with the operator
(   ) 2 and therefore a proper denition of a physical (i.e.
scheme-independent)
function depending on the coupling constant at a single energy scale is more subtle. a function
of this type was called central function in ref.
in the example of the previous section
the central function was 2f : it is physical since it is dened by a physical correlator (f alone,
instead, is scheme-dependent, since  is).
in general, the two-point function of an operator
o (with canonical dimension d and, for simplicity, not mixing with other operators) can be
written in the form

[12].

ho(x)o(y)i =

z 2[(t), (), s]a[(t), s]

|x  y|2d

=

b[(t), ()]

|x  y|2d

.

(2.21)

in order to be as explicit as possible, we use a (temporary) heavy notation. the variable s
refers to scheme dependence. the renormalization constant z depends in general on the values
of the coupling constant at two dierent energy scales:

z = exp z (t)

()

()d

() !

and on the subtraction scheme, since both  and  do. formula (2.21) contains no central
function: each function appearing there is either scheme-dependent or depends on the couplings
at two dierent energy scales (which prevents from dening univocal critical limits).

if the operator o is a conserved current, then z = 1 and b = b[(t)] has the desired
properties. in passing, we note that b is scheme-independent although the running coupling
constant (t) depends on the scheme, (t) = (t, s). the reason is that the function b, as
a function of , is also scheme-dependent, b = b(, s), while it is scheme-independent as a
function of t:
in b(t) = b[(t, s), s]. in the physical correlator the two scheme dependences
cancel each other.

if the operator o is the stress-energy tensor and scalar elds are present, then we need
an additional eort to identify the desired central function. as in ref.
[12], the matrix of
renormalization constants for the couple (o1,o2)  (, (cid:3)2) of mixing operators is triangular,

zij =  1 

0  ! = zij[(t), (), s],

(2.22)

 being the renormalization constant of the mass operator 2. we have

hoi(x)oj(0)i =

1

|x|4 zik[(t), (), s]zjl[(t), (), s]fkl[(t), s] 

1

|x|4 pij[(t), ()],

(2.23)

where we have exhibited all dependences as in (2.21). writing

pij[(t), ()]   p r

q ! ,

r

fkl[(t), s]   k h

(2.24)

g

= k 

h2
g  2[(t)]f [(t)]  0.

(2.25)

now, p  r2/q is manifestly scheme-independent, while k  h2/g does not depend on ().
the equality of the two expressions allows us to conclude that both expressions are scheme-
independent and functions of the running coupling (t). this denes the desired central function
when scalar elds are present, which we write as 2[(t)]f [(t)].
it has to be inserted into
formulas (2.13), (2.12), (2.16), etc., to give the general formula of the a-function. formula
(2.25) gives the only invariant of the similarity transformation p = zf z t, with p and f
symmetric and z triangular of the form (2.22).

we have factorized out a 2: indeed, p  h i is proportional to 2, while r  h 2i is
proportional to . finally, the denominator is regular since the function g is regular at criticality.
to see this, one observes that the factor  in the correlator h2 2i = q/|x|8 =  2g/|x|8 takes
care of the eventual anomalous dimension  of the operator 2 at criticality (  1/|x|2 ), so
that g remains non-vanishing (and positive by applying reection positivity to this correlator).
in

finally, reection positivity of hoi oji assures that the matrix p is positive-denite.

particular, det p is positive. since q is also positive, f  0 follows.

the existence of the (unique) invariant (2.25) for the similarity transformation that relates
p and f by the matrix z of (2.22) is an important fact; it assures that scalar elds are included
in the treatment. by comparing the calculations done in [11] and [10] one can appreciate the
additional amount of eort required by scalar elds.

our discussion about scheme dependence is an introduction to the notion of covariance

that we will formulate later on in this context (section 3.5).

3 the critical values of the quantity a: normalization, physical

meaning and its relationship with a

it is a consequence of our arguments that even if the quantity a is to some extent undetermined,
its rg group ow is uniquely determined. for example, the dierence auv air is the invariant
area of the graph of the beta function and the derivative of a is expressed in terms of a physical
correlator, h(x) (y)i. therefore, the ambiguity of a can be at most an additive constant, so
that once we normalize it at a reference energy scale (for example in the uv limit) then it is
xed at any energy scale. perturbative calculations allow us to arrive at the same conclusion
[10].

nevertheless, there is a preferred normalization choice for a. indeed, it turns out that the
quantities a and a have various properties in common. for example, they are both two-loop-
uncorrected, while c is two-loop-corrected. the relation between c and a that is sometimes
advocated in the literature [14], instead, is an artefact of the regularization technique. the
radiative corrections of both a and a begin at three loops. actually, they coincide (see sect.
3.2).

the conformal factor was found also by fradkin and tseytlin in ref. [27]. more recent studies
are those by cappelli and coste [28], antoniadis and mottola [29], and others [30, 31]. we take
the expression of the action from [29], which is more symmetric than the one given by riegert
(the dierence is a conformal-invariant term). one has to integrate the equation

we stress that the riegert action, obtained by integrating the trace anomaly, is not the complete
induced action:
it misses the conformal-invariant terms (local as well as non-local). only in
two dimensions is a conformally invariant term gauge-equivalent to zero.

we rederive sr in the particular case of a metric of the form g = e2 , which is sucient

for our purposes.

let us start from formula (2.5). the induced action sr[] for the conformal factor  is the

from this action, we immediately recover (2.7) with the correct sign (remember that (3.27)

3.2 discussion of the positive-deniteness of the riegert action and

its consequences

in this section i present a discussion about unitarity and the positive-deniteness of the riegert
action and give an argument that it is sucient to prove part of our statement, precisely point
(ii) of the a-theorem. i discuss also arguments for point (i).

a consequence of unitarity is that

15

if the classical action scl[] is positive-denite (in the euclidean framework), then the quan-

tum action is positive-denite.

we refer in particular to the functional generator [] of connected one-particle irreducible
diagrams. note that positive-deniteness does not imply the existence of a minimum. indeed,
there are examples where the quantum action does not have a minimum. positivity of the clas-
sical action assures that the functional integral is well dened, while positivity of the functional
generator  is the statement that the resulting theory makes physical sense. we assume the
the additive constants of scl and  are adjusted so that positive deniteness is equivalent to
boundedness from below.

in stating the above property we are thinking of bosonic actions (classical and quantum).
fermions can be included in the classical action with no problem. on the other hand, we are
mostly interested in induced actions for bosonic elds and sources.

the above statement would be trivial in the absence of divergences, but the regularization
cuts o certain frequencies and therefore violates unitarity. the statement is therefore false in
the regularized theory. renormalization can be seen as the process of restoring positivity by
compensating the undesirable eects of logarithms.

for example, the quadratic part of the induced action of fermions in an external electro-

magnetic eld reads in momentum space



1

32 z

d4p
(2)4 |f (p)|2 ln p2/2,

(3.29)

where 1 is the one-loop coecient of the beta function ( = 1+o(2)) and  a cut-o. this
expression is either positive or negative, depending on 1,  and the evaluation of the integral.
if, however, the electromagnetic eld is dynamical, there will be an additional contribution

1

16() z

d4p
(2)4 |f (p)|2 ,

(3.30)

which removes the divergence and restores positivity. indeed, () is dened in such a way
that the sum

is independent of . now, the rst term is always positive, while the negative contribution
coming from the second term is originated by the region |p| <  if 1 < 0 and |p| >  if 1 > 0.
either region is arbitrarily small in a suitable limit for  (  0 in the rst case, which is the
case of asymptotic freedom, and    in the second case, which is the case of ir freedom)
and therefore every negative contribution is reabsorbed. correctly, in these limits ()  0
to compensate for the innitely large negative contributions coming from the second term of
(3.31).

equivalently, one denes a running coupling (|p|) and writes the action (3.31) as

1

16 z

d4p
(2)4 |f (p)|2

1

(|p|)

.

d4p

(2)4 |f (p)|2(cid:18) 1

2

ln p2/2(cid:19)

(3.31)

then the statement is that the running coupling constant is everywhere positive, once it is
positive at a given energy. positivity at a given energy is assured by the physical normalization.
we remark that it is crucial to have a parameter to reabsorb the violations of positivity.
for example, if we just subtract the divergent part of (3.29), but we do not do it with the help
of a new (running) parameter we get an expression like



1

32 z

d4p
(2)4 |f (p)|2 ln p2/2,

(3.32)

with  arbitrary and nite. this expression is convergent, but not positive. renormalization
is not just a pure subtraction of divergences, but, more deeply, it is the unique way to restore
positivity.

our statement is valid also for the intermediate eective actions obtained by integrating
away some elds and considering the remaining elds as external sources. the example that
we have presented above (qed with integrated-out fermions) is indeed of this kind.

in summary, the violations of positivity are parametrized by local terms and can be reab-
sorbed by appropriate local counterterms, multiplied by physical parameters that can eventually
run in order to reabsorb the violations of positivity. if this goal cannot be achieved then the
theory has negatively normed states and unitarity is violated.

these observations, we think, suggest an instructive way to look at renormalization, that

we have not found emphasized in the existing literature2.

induced action for the external conformal factor

we now make a further step and consider induced actions for external sources ext. if we could
ignore the problems associated with divergences we could state that

if the classical action scl[, ] is positive denite in the full space of elds  and sources ,

then the quantum action is positive denite in the full space of elds and sources.

in general, external sources are not such that the classical action scl[, ] is positive denite
in the full space of elds and sources, but the (minimal) coupling to (external) gravity does
satisfy this requirement.

the above statement is again spoiled by divergences or eects related to divergences (like the
anomalies) and should be recovered by appropriate local counterterms equipped with arbitrary
parameters. when this is impossible there are negatively normed states.

for example, the polyakov action sp in two dimensions is negative denite and convergent.
positivity in two dimensions is recovered once the ghost contributions are included (see below).
the riegert action in four dimensions, as we are going to discuss, is positive. the quantities c, a,
a and h can be thought of as the matter contributions to the beta functions of higher-derivative
quantum gravity and there is no reason why they should have a denite sign.

in order to have a convergent induced eective action, one should consider sources coupled
to evanescent operators [24]. the riegert eective action, moreover, is convergent (notwith-
standing the inverted 2-operator), up to conformal-invariant terms (we recall that the riegert

2 we plan to elaborate further on this approach elsewhere.

17

action is dened up to such terms) and total derivatives. indeed, the divergence due to the
inverted 2-operator is proportional to

a(cid:18)g

3

r(cid:19)(cid:21)(cid:19)2

and therefore harmless. similarly in two dimensions the divergence is proportional to a total
derivative:

(cid:18)z d2xgr(cid:19)2

.

once we specialize to the conformal factor , coupled to the evanescent operator , convergence
is more apparent. this can be seen also o-criticality, where the quadratic part of the eective
action is read from correlator (2.17). in momentum space we have (dropping the contribution
from innity)

which is convergent, and positive as long as air is. the expression between brackets is equal to
auv in the limit |p|   and to air in the limit |p|  0 (but note that this expression does not
interpolate monotonically between the two values; for this purpose one should use the function
a(t) constructed in section 2.1).

convergence is an important property in the context of our discussion, because there is no

local counterterm that can cure the rst term, r ()2, in the riegert action sr. the second
term, instead, r r2, should be cured by the a-ambiguity itself. we conclude that when taking

into account of every contribution the total action should be positive-denite; otherwise the
theory has negatively normed states. in the next subsections we show that these facts allow us
to prove point (ii) of the a-theorem and part of point (i).

discussion of point (i) of the a-theorem

the total induced gravitational action contains three types of terms. the conformally invariant
terms, convergent or divergent as they might be, are not visible in the riegert action, which

there is no arbitrariness that can restore the eventual positivity violation in the term

be positive, which is point (i) of the a-theorem. however, there is a caveat. indeed, one has

contains the other two types of terms. the rst one is r ()2, with coecient a, which we
discuss here. the second term, r gr2, is discussed in the next subsection.
ar ()2, as we have already remarked. our positivity arguments apparently imply that a
cr ()2 in two dimensions and the same argument would imply c  0 in that case, which is
which gives a total induced action equal to (26 c)r ()2 in two dimensions. this is the action
that should be positive-denite. we have therefore 0  c  26.

we are indeed forgetting the contributions coming from the gravitational ghost modes (26),

wrong.

18

the statement is that if a quantum rg ow interpolates between two conformal eld theories
and the ir limit satises the bound c  26, then the uv limit satises the same bound.
examples of ows crossing the bound c = 26 are not known and we hope that our observations
stimulate a closer look into this matter. in string theory the induced action looks the same and
there are negatively normed states for c > 26 [32].

tional modes, studied in [30]. their calculation presents some problems and there are aspects

in four dimensions, the term r ()2 receives extra contributions coming from the gravita-
that have not been claried, yet. what we learn from [30] is that the term r ()2 should be

nally multipled by a + ag, where the ghost-contribution ag is non-negative. we have a bound
of the type

a  ag,

ag  0.

we cannot prove point (i) of the a-theorem, but we obtain a lower bound on the values of a.
it would be extremely important to understand ag and the other issues related with point (i)
of the a-theorem better.

proof of point (ii) of the a-theorem

the term r gr2 is not aected by divergences either.

it is a well-known fact that there
cannot be any r2-term in the trace anomaly at criticality (the absence of divergences o-
criticality was discussed in section 2.2). now, there is an arbitrary parameter associated with
this term, precisely a, and this should suce to assure positivity, nally explaining what the
a-ambiguity is there for. moreover, convergence implies that a is not a running parameter,
but just an additive constant, in agreement with the knowledge gained in the previous sections.

we conclude that the termr gr2 is positive-denite throughout the renormalization group

ow, once its coupling constant a  a is normalized to be positive at a given energy (we can
choose one of the two xed points). this observation is sucient to prove point (ii) of the
a-theorem, as we now show.

now, the term proportional to r gr2 is bounded from below at criticality if

a
  a.

(3.33)

this condition has to hold throughout the renormalization group ow, in particular

now, we know that

auv  auv



air  air.

auv  air.

let us x a by demanding that a and a coincide in the uv, auv = auv. then we have,
combining the various inequalities derived so far:

auv = auv  air  air,

wherefrom the claimed inequality auv  air follows.

19

now, let us tentatively suppose that with the normalization auv = auv we have the strict

inequality air > air. we prove that this is absurd and conclude that air = air.

we can do this by changing the normalization of a with the shift a  a new = aair+air,
uv = auv  air + air and therefore auv no longer

ir = air. we have auv  a new

so that a new
satises the inequality (3.33): a new

uv < auv. this is a contradiction. we conclude that

auv = auv



air = air.

(3.34)

in conclusion, the total rg ows of a and a are equal and given by formula (3.28). the
identication a = a is consistent and the dierence auv  air is equal to the area of the graph
of the beta function. the interplay between unitarity and renormalization is able to turn a
simple set of inequalities into a precise non-perturbative formula.

another way to state our result is that the coupling constant for the term r2g, which
is a  a, is inert, i.e.
its beta function is identically zero. this is not surprising, in the end,
since the running behaviour of a coupling constant is due to divergent contributions, but the
a-ambiguity is fully nite.

note that the result (3.34) would follow even if positivity implied a

  a instead of (3.33).

3.3 perturbative checks

in this section we check our predictions to the fourth loop order in perturbation theory around
the free xed point. the strategy for computing higher-loop corrections to the trace anomaly
was formulated by brown and collins [33], applied by hathrell [10, 11] and freeman [34] to the
third-loop order, and extended by jack and osborn to the fourth-loop order (and in several
other directions) [35].

we begin with the third loop analysis and use mostly the results of refs.

[10, 11], since,
to our knowledge, the papers by hathrell are the only ones in which the term r is treated
explicitly. the paper by freeman does not calculate a, but it contains enough information
to derive it, once hathrells formulas are used. moreover, the hathrellfreeman results are
easily extended to a general third-loop expression that can be directly applied, in particular,
to the qcd conformal window, in the neighbourhood of the asymptotic-freedom point. such a
formula shows perfect agreement with our prediction, i.e. that the total rg ows of a and a
coincide and are equal to the invariant area of the graph of the beta function.

for the purposes of this section, there is no dierence between tilded and untilded quantities
of section 1. indeed, we are just interested in comparing critical values and ows of critical
values.

in massless qed we have [10]

c = 18 +

f = 45.

+ o(3),

these values are independent of the subtraction scheme. while c required an independent
calculation, the perturbative corrections of a and a were computed from each other and turn

20

out to be equal. this coincidence is already what we need, nevertheless the perturbative check
is not exhausted by this observation, since the above ows turn out to have the wrong signs.
the explanation of this fact will emerge from the nal formula. for the moment, we keep this
observation in mind.

similarly, in pure yangmills theory with gauge group g we have [34]

c(g) + o(2)(cid:21) ,
c(g)2 + o(3),

a = 2 dim g (cid:20)31 + 255(cid:16)

c = 4 dim g (cid:20)3

in [34] a is not calculated explicitly, but the formula for the function h() is given. we have
used the techniques of hathrell to derive a from h(). it is clear that the two terms r and
r2 in  are related and one can indeed work out the precise relationship as in [10]. we observe
that, again, the rst perturbative corrections to a and a coincide, but have the wrong sign.

going through hathrell and freemans calculations, we have derived a very simple general
formula for the ows of a and a for asymptotically free theories with a perturbative ir xed
point. we have

auv  air = auv  air =

where 1 and 2 are the rst two coecients of the beta function, () = 1+22 +o(3). if
the theory is ir-free, instead, the formula has an additional minus sign. hathrell and freemans
results are correctly reproduced ( 1
2 fuv22 for the perturbative corrections in
in qed, 1 = 2/(3) and 2 = 1/(22); in pure yangmills

c /(122). hathrell does not observe the equality of the
theory, 1 = 11nc/(6), 2 = 17n 2
a- and a-ows, but it is relatively simple to show that this result is, to some extent, implicit
in the derivation, at least to the third-loop order. the key formula is (5.27) of [10].

at this point it is straightforward to show that our formula (3.28) gives exactly the same

result as (3.35), as we wanted.

our theorem allows us to derive the above three-loop result in a straightforward way. one
just needs the one-loop value of f and the two-loop formula of the beta function. extending
the techniques of hathrell and freeman to all orders in perturbation theory should allow us
to prove the equality of the uxes of a and a in a direct way. an eort in this sense is being
undertaken.

the sign mismatches noted above have the following explanation: the second coecient 2
is positive only when there is an ir xed point, while it is negative in pure yangmills theory,
where there is no such point. the a-theorem does not need to hold, in general, when the ir xed
point does not exist and several cases of this kind were indeed found in ref. [7]. in particular,
a is often negative o the conformal window. it is nevertheless gratifying to observe that the
coecient in question is precisely 2, so that as soon as the ir xed point exists, the theorem
is satised and when the theorem is not satised, this is a signal that the ir xed point does

21

not exist (it might still exist, as in qcd, after the introduction of the relevant non-perturbative
eects, but this would change also the formulas for the rg ows of a and a, and in the end
the a-theorem will have to be satised).

concretely, in qcd with nf avours and nc colours we have

auv  air =

44
5

ncnf(cid:18)1 

11
2

nc

nf(cid:19)2

= auv  air.

for a generic gauge group g and representation r we take the two-loop beta function from
[37]. we have

auv  air =

605 c(g) dim g

7c(g) + 11c(r)(cid:18)1 

11
4

c(g)

t (r)(cid:19)2

= auv  air.

in supersymmetric qcd, formula (3.35) is in agreement with the exact results of [6]. for
concreteness, we take n=1 sqcd with group g = su (nc) and nf quanks and antiquarks in
the fundamental representation. the value of fuv is still 45 dim g and 1 =  1
2 (3nc  nf ),
2 = ncnf /(42). we have for nf . 3nc,

auv  air =

45
2

ncnf(cid:18)1  3

nc

nf(cid:19)2

= auv  air,

in agreement with the exact formula [6]

auv  air =

15
2

ncnf(cid:18)1  3

nc

nf(cid:19)2(cid:18)2 + 3

nc

nf(cid:19)

(recall that there is an additional factor of 360 with respect to ref. [6] due to a change in the
normalization).

as a further conrmation, we report the results for a scalar eld  with a 

4! 4-interaction

from [11]:

c = 1 

a = a

[11] does not give the a correction explicitly, which was calculated using [10]. the
ref.
rst perturbative corrections to a and a are still equal, although they are related in a more
complicated way, as a reection of the discussion of section 2.3. nevertheless, to the second
loop order we can neglect the renormalization mixing between the stress tensor and 2.

our predictions agree with the results of hathrell, but the formula is now slightly dierent
3(4)4 3 +o(4) = 12 + 23 +

4! 4 and () =  d

d = 3

(4)2 2 17

from (3.35). we have  =  
o(4), so that

auv  air =z uv

22

note that in order to apply our formula correctly in the absence of an interacting xed point,
we have to treat 1 as an independent (small) parameter and pretend that an uv xed point
does exist at uv =  1
. therefore we write () = 22(  uv) + o(4) and replace
1 with 2uv everywhere else. finally, we compare the coecient multiplying 4
uv in the
expression of auv  air with hathrells result. the numerical factor 1
12 , instead of 1
2 , is due to
the dierent powers of  appearing in the beta function and is crucial for the test.

fourth-loop-order checks

we can check agreement to the fourth-loop order using the calculations done by jack and osborn
in ref. [35]. again, we have to merge these results with some basic formulas of hathrells [10]
to extract the precise expression for a, which is not given explicitly in [35]. we do not give
here the complete derivation, but provide a vucabulary that allows the reader to surf on the
various references and notations. unfortunately, the various pieces of the puzzle are distributed
in many dierent papers. for concreteness, we treat the case of a gauge eld theory.

our a is

720(4)2(c + c()  ()) = 720(4)2(c  )

in hathrells notation (this c has nothing to do with our c). c denotes the arbitrary additive
constant. hathrell proves that c() and () are related by the formula  =  c
 . the
quantity c =  coincides with the c of [35]. the notations for the coupling constants are
as follows ([35][10]): gi = 1

4 ().
4 a(g). the explicit expression of
a(g) (related to our function f - see below) is given in the second line of formula (5.12) of ref.
[35].

g2  1

4 , i =  2
gi(cid:17) in [35] and a

g3 (g)   1
ij = g6

c is written as 1

we nd therefore

denoting the total ow kuv  kir of a generic quantity k with k, we have  = 1

therefore we can write

a = 90(4)2(cid:18)x + 

now, we learn from formula (29) of [36] that

x

(3.36)

x + 

x


= 2a

ijigj + i x

for a certain regular function x (called y in [35]). this suces to assure that the rst term
on the right-hand side of (3.36) vanishes. therefore we recover our formula for a once we

23

identify f with 90a(4)2. using (5.12) of [35] we see that this identication agrees with
our previous third-loop-order results (f = 45 dim g + o()).

on the other hand, we have

a = 360(4)2z uv

ir

d

 b


= 45(4)2z ir

g.

now g = 2a up to the fourth-loop order (see formula (5.12) of [35]). this is the analogue
of hathrells key relation (formula (5.27) of [10]), used for the three-loop checks. we conclude
that the identication a = a is consistent to the fourth-loop order included, as we wished
to show.

according to the references that we have used, the extension of the three- and four-loop
agreement to all orders is not trivial. in saying that the higher order eects will conspire to
satisfy our statement we are making a strong claim. pursuing this check to even higher orders
would be desirable and is not out of reach, given that exact formulas exist in supersymmetric
theories. the fth-loop-order correction to a just needs the four-loop beta function [38] and
the three-loop expression of f .

3.4 the casimir eect

the identication a = a allows us to give an unambiguous expression for the casimir eect on
a given manifold m. the derivation, that we do not repeat here, is performed by mapping the
manifold m into a conformally equivalent manifold m where the eect is known. we refer to
the papers of blote, cardy and nightingale [39] and aeck [40] for details. for example, on
a cylinder of radius r the formula for the vacuum energy e0 reads in our notation, using the
results of cappelli and coste [28],

e0 =

1
360

a
r

,

(cid:18)e0 = 

1
12

c
r

in two dimensions.(cid:19)

for a generic the expression reads

e0 =

1

3a + a

1440

r

,

and the shift of a can be seen as a shift in the vacuum energy e0. quantum irreversibility can
be reformulated as a statement on the vacuum energy, euv  eir  0.

3.5 proper beta function and coupling constant

our formula, as we have stressed already, gives a natural geometrical interpretation of quantum
irreversibility, which turns out to be quantitatively measured by the invariant area of the graph
of the beta function between the critical points. at intermediate scales , the quantity a[()]
knows about the area spanned by the part of graph up to the scale  (see fig. 1). there is a
universal cell of unit area for each massless degree of freeedom. the number of massless degrees

,

for x 6= y.

(3.37)

of freedom disappearing between two given energy scales is equal to the area of the graph of
the beta function included between those scales.

using the results of the previous sections, we can introduce a notion of covariance related
to scheme dependence and dene a proper coupling constant  and beta function (). we
observe that the function f () is a metric in the space of couplings. precisely, when there are
more couplings and  = ioi we have

and the matrix fij is positive denite. the total a-ow is then expressed in the form

auv  air = z ln ir

ln uv

d ln i j()f ij();

f ij is a sort of target metric for the map t  i(t). this map is the path connecting uv
with ir in the space of couplings, and it is in general scheme-dependent, as well as the metric
f ij() and i. the integral is reparametrization-invariant. in this context reparametrization
invariance is precisely scheme independence.

*

ir



fig. 1. quantum irreversibility.

by denition, the proper coupling constant is the coupling constant for which the metric is
identically equal to the free-eld (uv) value, fij() = (fuv)ij. both i and fij depend on the
scheme and in the proper scheme one can measure these quantities in a universal way.

let us focus on the case of a single coupling constant , for simplicity. by denition, we

can write

moreover, we have

2()f () = 2()fuv.

() =

d ln

=

so that the formula relating the proper coupling constant to the starting one, reads

() = (0) exp z

d

 s f ()
fuv ! .

 is a power expansion in . an arbitrary integration constant survives in  as a remnant of
scheme dependence. , instead, is uniquely xed and universal.

for example, one can x the integration constant at the ir xed point (which we assume
to be an interacting conformal eld theory), by setting 0 = ir. there is no universal way to
choose the overall factor (ir). if the ir xed point is strongly coupled, then it is reasonable
to set ir = 1, by denition. independently of this value, one has uv = 0.

the loss of massless degrees of freedom along the renormalization group ow is measured
by the proper area of the graph of the beta function, i.e. the area of the graph of the proper
beta function,

auv  air = fuvz ln ir

ln uv

d ln ().

to the lowest order in perturbation theory we have  = const.  + o(2). if we dene, in-
stead,  as the coupling for which the metric is exactly unity thgoughout the rg ow, so that
2()f () = 2(), we have f ()/fuv  f () in the formulas above and the transformation
is no longer analytical, since around the free xed point we have () = const. fuv. for
example, in qcd ln  =p45(n 2

we nally remark that the denition of proper coupling constant is valid in any dimensions,
even or odd, and in particular in three dimensions. in odd dimensions, the integral (3.28) is still
a well-dened and interesting physical quantity (it could be considered, by extension, the eect
of quantum irreversibility in odd dimensions), but there is no clear denition of a at criticality.

c  1) ln  + const.

4 conclusions

several apparently unrelated facts suggest that the a-ambiguity can be consistently removed by
identifying a with a. we have analysed various issues related with unitarity, renormalization
and positivity of the induced actions, which prove part of the a-theorem, in particular the
statement of quantum irreversibility, and might help proving a  0 also.

the emerging picture claries several long-standing issues at the same time, among which
we recall the ambiguity of the term r, the positivity of a (with a caveat), the decreasing
behaviour of a along the renormalization group ow, the meaning of the riegert action, the
casimir eect, the conceptual dierences between two and four dimensional quantum eld
theory.

the equality of the total ows of a and a gives an explicit formula quantifying the eect
of quantum irreversibility as the invariant (i.e. scheme-independent) area of the graph of the
beta function between the xed points. this formula can be checked explicitly to the fourth-
loop order in perturbation theory in all renormalizable models. there is a unity proper area

26

associated with each massless degree of freedom disappearing along the renormalization group
ow.

this establishes the intrinsic relationship between renormalization (the beta function), uni-
tarity (absence of negatively normed states) and irreversibility (disappearance of massless de-
grees of freedom along the renormalization group ow), which we can schematically state as
the implication

unitarity + renormalization  irreversibility.

the interplay between unitarity and renormalization is better appreciated by observing that
in a running theory the requirement that there be no negatively normed states naturally de-
composes in two separate conditions: the requirement that there be no negatively normed state
at some reference energy plus the requirement that no negatively normed state be generated
along the renormalization group ow. this interplay turns a simple set of inequalities into the
mentioned non-perturbative formula for the a-ow.

a by-product of our formula is an alternative, direct proof of the property [6] that a is
invariant with respect to marginal deformations: no massless degrees of freedom can disap-
pear along a trajectory with   0. given that also c is invariant with respect to marginal
deformations [6], a formula for the non-perturbative ow of c, resembling (3.28), should exist.
a further, non-trivial, implication is that along a non-trivial rg ow the quantity a strictly
decreases. therefore two conformal eld theories with the same a-values cannot be the critical
points of an rg ow. this fact was conjectured in [41].

we have also traced the basic lines of an approach to the removal of divergences in quantum
eld theory, according to which regularization and renormalization are viewed as the violation
and restoration of unitarity, respectively. negatively normed states are introduced to regularize
and then consistently removed to renormalize. in stressing the role of local terms and running
parameters in this context, as well as the issues related with positive-deniteness of the induced
eective actions, in particular induced eective actions for external sources, this approach seems
to be more powerful than the usual one [20] and deserves further study per se.
