(10.1) also shows well-dened roots unity; alternatively seen explicit formulas given e.g. . action fundamental representations found explicitly, see . real, essentially invariant metric gij, (5.26). (5.16) together statement = 1 irreducible representation follows easily, since := v12 grouplike, i.e. () = , remains check 1 fundamental representations, agrees classical limit. finally, show x1 = s(x). again, veried fundamental representations, follows tensor product representations (10.1) fact sides (5.15) algebra maps. 11 appendix c: proofs proof theorem 4.1 fact f (k) = lres(k1) = lf in(k1) character classically k stated already explained text; also seen large extent considering various casimirs. remains show linearly independent roots unity, (4.6) holds. linear independence clear: nontrivial linear combination vectors f (k) zero, would exists nontrivial submodule form f (k0) (f (ki)) 6= 0. would mean least one f (k) contains highest weight vector, contradiction f (k) irreducible (this also follows wellknown facts representations roots unity ). (4.6) follows immediately, characters hence dimensions f (k) classically. proof lemma 5.1: assume acts trivially . since lres() highest weight module, every v lres() written form v = u w u u res . dene v := (u) w. welldened, (hi w) = (hi) w = hi w assumption. clearly 2 = 1, c matrix representing t, c 2 = 1 (5.24) follow. q 37 see lres() real, observe lres() contains vector w weight , since hi1 = (hi) acts trivially . implies (e.g. method characters) generic q, representation lres() lres() precisely one trivial component, denes invariant tensor. viewed solution equations x + = hi = 0 analytic q. therefore invariant tensor smooth, induces invariant tensor also roots unity, irreducible representation lres() obtained quotient generic ones. hence lres() real. also seen theorem 2.3. next prove (5.25). (5.23) implies (u)t = b1((u))b b = ca, applying twice yields (u) = (bt b1)(u)(bt b1)1, (11.1) (11.2) using 2 = id. since representation irreducible, schurs lemma implies bt b1 = 1, equivalently bt = b c. possible = 1, thus bt = b. (11.3) similarly, taking complex conjugate (11.1), obtain (u) = b1((u))b = b1 ((u))t b = b1 b1(u)bb, (11.4) using (5.6) (u) = (u). hand, (u) = (u), follows bb = 1. together (11.3), implies bb = 1. constant must real positive bb positive denite matrix. assume determinant b (or g) modulus one, hence bb = 1. (11.5) decomposing b = x + iy real matrices x, , follows  = 0. thus x simultaneously (block)diagonalized real, orthogonal matrix o, b written form b = ot jo j diagonal bt = b, j block diagonal blocks proportional to(cid:18) 0 1 0 (cid:19) bt = b. changing basis using matrix yields (u)t = j 1((u))j preserving (5.6), j desired form 38 1 transformation unitary diagonal matrix. particular, (5.25) together j c = g() (see (5.23)) implies g = j c(1). (11.6) next, show j = 1 representation orthogonal q = 1, j = j symplectic. equation (5.21) holds also u = , () = 1 (this understood e.g. explicit form {$9904091$} power series u res , simply fact acts trivially trivial representations). using (5.14), implies q (11.7) since lres() real, lres() lres() contains precisely one trivial module generic q, classically. case, known  l () = gkl gij(r1)ij mnm k ()n (11.8) k ()n nm = ij gij(r1)ij mn = gij( r1)ij l () = gkl, qcgnmm nm = qcgnm c classical quadratic casimir. q = 1, ( r)ij mn permutation operator, hence = 1 l() orthogonal q = 1, = 1 symplectic. case, qcgnmm n(1). 1 = v1 n(), g() = (g())t . (5.16), together (2.30) obtain gnmm (11.6), implies jc = (jc)t . denition, c leaves subspace weight invariant, c = 1. hence j = j, claim follows. particular, shown c = jcj 1, also seen calculating ((u))t 2 dierent ways using schurs lemma. finally, taking adjoint (5.24) yields ((u)) = ((u)) = c(u)c. hand, ((u)) = c (u)c , schurs lemma implies cc = 1 c. since c = 1 highest weight vector, obtain c = c.
