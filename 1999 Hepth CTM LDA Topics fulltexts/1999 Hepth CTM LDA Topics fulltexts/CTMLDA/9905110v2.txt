abstract

in this paper, fermions are minimally coupled to 3d-gravity where
a dynamical torsion is introduced. a kalb-ramond eld is non-
minimally coupled to these fermions in a gauge-invariant way. we
show that a 1-loop mass generation mechanism takes place for both
the 2-form gauge eld and the torsion. as for the fermions, no mass
is dynamically generated: at 1-loop, there is only a mass shift pro-
portional to the yukawa coupling whenever the fermions have a non-
vanishing tree-level mass.

introduction

the mechanism of dynamical (gauge-invariant) mass generation in 2d and
3d gauge theories has received a great deal of attention over the last two
decades [1, 2, 3, 4]. in particular, three-dimensional maxwell theory coupled
to massive fermions yields a 1-loop corrected photon propagator with a non-
trivial pole [5, 6, 7, 8].

in this regard, we shall investigate in our paper a model where fermionic
matter is minimally coupled to 3d-gravity in the presence of torsion. con-
sidering the situation of a at background with propagating torsion, we shall
discuss the issue of mass generation for both the fermion and the torsion
itself. the interaction between the scalar component of the torsion (this is a
feature of 3d space-time) and the fermion provides a 1-loop mass correction
for the latter. on the other hand, the uctuation of the torsion scalar may
acquire a 1-loop mass proportional to the fermion mass parameter. this is
treated in section 2.

proceeding further, in section 3, we discuss the interaction between a
3d kalb-ramond-type (k-r) eld and fermions with non-minimal coupling.
the former has no on-shell degrees of freedom, as a peculiarity of three space-
time dimensions. however, the fermions, that couple to both the torsion and
the 2-form gauge potential, induce a 1-loop self-energy mixing among these
elds, so that the k-r eld becomes dynamical and acquires a non-trivial
mass. we check that unitarity is ensured at 1-loop and the longitudinal
degree of freedom excited at the k-r eld does not correspond to a ghost.

our concluding remarks are presented in section 4.

2 matter coupling

we start by setting up a few relations and properties of riemann-cartan
space-time that we shall make use of throughout this work. the ane con-

1

nection is non-symmetric in the rst two indices. its non-symmetric part,
2 
[] = t 
 can be
split as below:

 , is the torsion tensor [9, 10]. in this space-time,  

 

 =n 

o + k 

 ,

(2.1)

where n 

o is the christoel symbol, completely determined by the metric

and its derivatives, and

k 

 =

1

2(cid:16)t 

 + t 

 (cid:17)
  t 

(2.2)

is the contortion tensor, which is antisymmetric in the last two indices.

this implies that, in such a framework, n-dimensional gravity is described

by two independent objects, namely, the metric and the torsion tensors.

in 3d, the 9 degrees of freedom of the torsion can be covariantly decom-
posed into its so(1,2)-irreducible components: a trace part, t  t 
 , a
totally antisymmetric part,   t, and a traceless rank-2 symmetric
tensor, x. the splitting in the above components is accomplished by the
following relation:

t =  +

1
2

(t  t) + x 

.

(2.3)

the peculiarity of 3d, as compared to 4d-gravity, is the appearance of a

scalar component for the torsion.

in this work, we shall be concerned with the minimal coupling between
fermions and torsion. as we shall soon understand, only the -component
indeed minimally couples to fermions. on the other hand , it is worthwhile to
mention that the spin-2 component, x, plays a peculiar role when chern-
simons gravity is considered: it inuences the spin-2 sector of the graviton
propagator and it is responsible for the appearance of a massive ghost-like
mode in the spectrum [11].

at rst sight, the easier way to obtain interactions between torsion and
relativistic elds is through a covariant derivative under the minimal cou-
pling prescription. as we have seen, the ane connection contains a torsion-
dependent piece, and therefore in each covariant derivative of the eld under
consideration there is an interaction with torsion. however, we must be
careful since this procedure, in the case of some elds, may spoil the gauge
invariance of the theory. in fact, an abelian gauge eld, a, cannot interact

2

minimally with torsion while keeping the gauge invariance requirement (the
same occurs with the k-r gauge eld, b, which will be object of study in
section 3). for a scalar theory, the covariant derivative is the usual one, and
hence it does not minimally couple to torsion either. on the other hand, the
requirement that the dirac equation in a gravitational eld preserve local
lorentz invariance yields a direct interaction between torsion and fermions.
in riemann-cartan space-time, the dirac action for a massive fermion has
the form

sd =z d3xg(cid:20) i

2(cid:16)d  d(cid:17)  m(cid:21) ,

where the covariant derivatives of the spinor elds are given by

we are using the following representation for the dirac matrices in locally

at 3d space-time:

0 = 3; 1 = i1; 2 = i2,

where i are the pauli matrices. they satisfy the following relations:

and

na, bo = 2ab1,
ab = ab1  iabcc.

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

since we are here mainly interested in the interaction between torsion and
fermions, we set g = . this amounts to saying that we wish to study
torsion eects on a at background or, rephrasing, the metric uctuations
are taken to be very weak as compared to the torsion excitations.

after some algebra, the dirac lagrangian in the presence of torsion is

given by

l=l0 + li,
where l0 is the free-eld dirac lagrangian,

l0 = i  m,

and li is the interaction term,
li =

i
4

k[  ],

(2.12)

(2.13)

(2.14)

where [  ] is the totally antisymmetric product of three dirac matrices.
using the identity [  ] = i3!1, the interaction term can be shown
to simplify to:

.

(2.15)

we thus see that only the -component survives coupling to fermions, as long
as the minimal coupling prescription is picked out. thus, the interaction of
torsion and fermions is seen to be a yukawa coupling.

from (2.12-2.15), one sees that  appears without dynamics, and con-
sequently torsion does not propagate. but now, we wish to go beyond the
minimal coupling term by discussing some implications of the hypothesis
that torsion is a propagating eld. in our considerations, we shall be deal-
ing only with the scalar component of torsion (), since this is the only
mode of t 
that couples to fermions. in this case, the next step is to ob-

tain a lagrangian that contains a kinetic term for this eld. several classes
of torsion lagrangians can be obtained via the minimal substitution pro-
cedure, namely, by replacing the christoel symbol by the cartan ane
connection. nevertheless, following this procedure, we obtain only one al-
gebraic term for the -eld coming from the einstein-hilbert lagrangian,
r  2. this shows that torsion, as well as the graviton, does not propagate
in the standard einstein gravity in three-dimensional space-time. in view of
that, higher curvature terms must be introduced in order to provide kinetic

4

terms for torsion. in fact, this is obtained from the higher-curvature terms

3 r2(cid:17)  . therefore, we rst consider the following action

(cid:16)rr  1

s = sd + sr,

(2.16)

where sd is given by (2.4) and sr is

sr =z d3xg(cid:20)ar + b(cid:18)r r 

1
3

r2(cid:19)(cid:21) .

(2.17)

finally, we can write that, in a at background, the lagrangian for fermions
and torsion reads as follows:

l =   22 + i  m + ,

where we have redened the eld    = b, so that 2 = a
b and
 =  3
. notice that we must require that b > 0 and a > 0 to ensure that
2b
2 be positive and that  be real. moreover, the canonical dimensions of the
elds and parameters are given below:

(2.18)

[] =

1
2

;

[] = 1;

[b] = 1;

[a] = 1.

(2.19)

the term in the curvature squares in the action (2.17) do not give rise to

a quartic scalar self-interaction.

a remark is in order: we start o with non-vanishing mass parameters, 2
and m. however, after carrying out the 1-loop calculations, we can set  = 0
and analyse how the masses are corrected. we should stress that setting m =
0 after all the 1-loop corrections are computed is not a sensible procedure,
since we would be passing from a parity-broken to a parity-restoring model.
so, the limit procedure m  0 is not smooth after perturbative calculations.
indeed, setting m = 0 at the end of the loop calculations might erroneously
point out fermion mass generation [8].

now, we can extract the feynman rules for the theory. the propagators
for the scalar and spinor elds that stem from the free action are as follows:

and

i0 (p) =

i

p2  2

is0 (p) =

=

i (6 p + m)
p2  m2

.

i

6 p  m

(2.20)

(2.21)

furthermore, the fermion-torsion vertex is given by

v (, ) = i.

(2.22)

since  carries dimension 1
in fact, a power-counting analysis shows that the supercial degree of diver-
gence of primitively divergent graphs, , decreases as the number of vertices
increases:

2, one can see that this vertex is super-renormalisable.

vn 

e  e,

(2.23)

where vn is the number of vertices, while e and e are the external lines
associated  and , respectively.

from these results, we turn into the calculation of the self-energy correc-
tions for the bare propagators and discuss the mechanism of mass generation
for massless elds, by looking at the poles of the 1-loop corrected propagators.
for the fermion self-energy graph, we nd:

 i (p) = (i)2 (i)2z

d3l
(2)3

(6 p 6 l + m)

h(p  l)2  m2i (l2  2)

.

(2.24)

as we are interested in reading o a mass generation, we are allowed to set
the external momentum to zero. in so doing, we nd

 i (0) = i

2m

4 (m + )

.

(2.25)

the insertion of this 1-loop graph leads to the following 1-loop corrected
propagator:

is = is0 + is0(cid:16)ix(cid:17) is0 + ...

i

=

6 p  m p .

(2.26)

the above result shows that, if we had started with massless torsion1 and
fermion, the fermion self-energy correction (2.25) would still be dierent from
zero and given exclusively in terms of the yukawa coupling, . however,

1torsion with vanishing mass yields the same infra-red problem as found in qed3 .

6

this result should not be interpreted as a dynamical mass generation for the
fermion, since, as already mentioned, the limit m  0, after perturbative
calculations have been done, is not consistent [8]. from this, one obtains a
4(cid:17)2
modied propagator, (2.26), which has a massive pole at p2 = (cid:16)m2  2
.

also, the torsion self-energy is calculated, and we get

i (p) =  (i)2 (i)2z
i (0) = i

m2

.



d3l
(2)3

tr [(6 l + m) (6 l 6 p + m)]
(l2  m2)h(l  p)2  m2i ,

(2.27)

similarly, the modied torsion propagator is obtained by summing up the

series

i = i0 + i0 (i) i0 + ...

(2.28)

=

i

p2  2 + 

.

here, we have another mass correction, at this time for the pole of the
torsion propagator. from this result, we conclude that, whenever the torsion
eld mediates the interaction between massive fermions, it exhibits a short
range behaviour. in other words, if we consider, from the beginning, a mass-
less torsion theory by setting a = 0, its 1-loop corrected propagator exhibits
a pole at p2 = m2
 . we should stress that dynamical mass generation for
torsion requires its coupling to massive fermions.

we conclude this section by noting that, for massless fermions (m = 0),
the lagrangean (2.18) has parity (p) symmetry, since  (pseudo-scalar) and
 are not invariant under this symmetry operation in 3d, namely

 p ,
 p ,

so that  p . on the other hand, having in mind that a 4-term could
have been introduced via r r or r2, and setting the parameters such
that the -eld acquires a non-vanishing vacuum expectation value (v.e.v),
fermions could become massive upon the spontaneous symmetry breaking of
p by means of such a v.e.v..

7

so far, we have been dealing with a theory involving torsion and a spinor
eld. next, we wish to include the k-r eld and to study a possible way to
endow it with a mass and a dynamical character by means of the fermion-
mediated interaction that couples it to torsion.

3 mass generation for the k-r field

following the same procedure as in the previous section, we shall now ex-
amine the behaviour of the antisymmetric k-r eld, b, in 3d and the
mechanism of mass generation for such a eld whenever fermions are consid-
ered. the motivation to study 2-form gauge elds in 3d may be supported
by the interest of studying supersymmetric self-dual vortices with anomalous
magnetic moment coupling, as recently discussed in the work of ref. [13].

we start from the well-known free action for this eld:

s =

1

6z d3xggg,

where g is the eld-strength, written in terms of b as

(3.29)

g = b + b + b .

(3.30)

the action is invariant under the local gauge transformation

b (x) =  (x)   (x) ,

(3.31)

where  is an arbitrary vector. so, in order to obtain the free propagator
of the theory, one must to x this gauge invariance; we choose the following
gauge-xing term

sgf = z d3xg(cid:16)fb(cid:17)2

,

(3.32)

where  = 
3! b is the dual of b. the tilde on 
means that we are considering only the riemannian part of the connection
in the covariant derivative.

g and b = 1

it is worthy to remind that, in 4d, b has one on-shell degree of freedom
and its main application is in connection with the gauge invariant mechanism

8

of mass generation for the electromagnetic eld a through the topological
coupling term fb. however, in 3d, the free b-eld does not have
on-shell degrees of freedom; therefore, it appears only in the internal lines of
feynman diagrams.

then, following our study of dynamical mass generation in 3d theories,
we propose the following interaction term between fermions and b, without
spoiling gauge invariance:

si = z d3xfb,

(3.33)

in an attempt to obtain a (dynamical) on-shell degree of freedom for b.
here  carries dimension  1
2, and hence the renormalizability of the theory is
certainly lost. so, one can consider this only as a low-energy eective theory.
in this sense, we begin with a lagrangian in the at space-time background,
which is the sum of (2.18), (3.29), (3.32) and (3.33), namely

l = (b)2 +   22 + i  m +

(3.34)

+  + +b,

+(cid:16) b(cid:17)2

where the bilinear sector of the lagrangian leads, besides the propagators
(2.20) and (2.21) for torsion and fermion elds, to the following b-propagator

ig

0 (p) = i( 1

2p2

 +

) ,

1
2p2

(3.35)

 and  being the transverse and longitudinal projectors in the space of
vectors, respectively. notice that the k-r eld appears in (3.34) through its
dual (b).

now, we can verify the absence of on-shell degrees of freedom for the
massless vector eld (the k-r eld), by saturating its propagator with ex-
ternal currents j, which satises the following conservation law:

pj = 0.

(3.36)

in 3d, a general current may be expanded with respect to a particular basis

j = ap + bep + c,

9

(3.37)

where p = (p0,p ) , ep = (p0,p ) , and  = (0, ) . however, (3.36)
implies that b = c = 0. therefore, taking the imaginary part of the residue
(at the pole p2 = 0) of the transition amplitude, a = j (p) g
0 (p) j (p), we
obtain

imres (a) = lim
p20

|a|2
2

p2 = 0.

(3.38)

from this result, we nd that the massless pole does not propagate.

returning to the feynman rules, the torsion-fermion vertex is given by

(2.22), whereas the b   vertex is as follows:
v (b, ) = p.

(3.39)

once the feynman rules for the theory have been derived, we turn out to

calculate the self-energy correction for the complete propagator.

besides the usual self-energy corrections to the torsion and b-propagators,
there is an additional mixed self-energy graph which contains one -eld and
one b-eld as external lines. this 1-loop graph induces an indirect b  
coupling which contributes to the mechanism of mass generation.
then, using the above feynman rules, one arrives at the following results

for self-energy graphs of the elds:

i = i

m2



p2 ,

i = 

m



p,

(3.40)

(3.41)

where i and i are the b b and the mixed b   1-loop self-energy
diagrams respectively (the self-energy for the torsion eld is the same as in
(2.27)). hence, the total self-energy for the b   system is more suitably
set in a matrix form:

i(t ) =  i m2

 p2  m
2 p
i m2
m
2 p



! .

(3.42)

analogously, the inverse propagator for this system is set in a diagonal matrix
form

0 =  (2p2 + 2p2)
d1

0

0

(p2  2) ! .

(3.43)

10

the inverse of the modied propagator is given by

d1 = d1

0 + (t ).

replacing (3.42) and(3.43) in (3.44), d1 reads as

d1 =

2p2 + 2(cid:16)1 + m2

2 (cid:17) p2

 im

2 p

im
2 p

p2  2  m2



 .

the corrected propagators are nally obtained in momentum space by in-
verting this matrix. so, the complete propagator for the b-eld reads as
follows:

(3.44)

(3.45)

ig (p) = i

1

2p2

 + (cid:16)p2  2  m2

 (cid:17)(cid:16)1 + m2
2 (cid:17)1

2p2 (p2  m 2)

whereas the scalar propagator reads as below:

where

m 2 = 2 +

m2



+

i (p) =

i

,

p2  m 2
2 !2 1 +
2  m

1

m2

2 !1

.

,

(3.46)



(3.47)

this shows that the minimal coupling of torsion to matter is fundamental
to obtain a massive pole for the gauge eld, since if  = 0 (m 2 = 2), only
the massless pole survives, as it can be seen from (3.46). in the case of a
massless torsion, one has

m 2 =

m2

 1 +

m2

8  1 +

m2

2 !1 .

moreover, for the imaginary part of the residue at the massive pole, we obtain
a positive result, namely

imres (a) = |a|2

4

(cid:16) m
2 (cid:17)2
2 (cid:17)2 > 0,
(cid:16)1 + m2

11

which ensures propagation of a physical degree of freedom. therefore, the
indirect coupling between torsion and the k-r eld in 3d results in the
appearence of a massive propagating pole at the physical longitudinal sector
of b.

alternatively, one could also obtain a massive pole in the b-propagator
through the direct mixing term b, which couples the k-r eld to
the totally antisymmetric part of torsion eld.

4 concluding remarks

the central idea of the present paper is to illustrate how torsion may play
a role in dynamically generating mass for 3d theories coupled to gravity.
fermions minimally coupled to torsion pick out only the scalar component
of the latter, and their interaction provides the fermions with a 1-loop non-
vanishing mass correction that does not depend on the fermion tree-level
mass, but only on the coupling constant. our viewpoint is that no mass is
dynamically generated for the fermions. on the other hand, torsion itself
may acquire a non-vanishing mass by means of 1-loop radiative correction.
as long as a k-r eld is coupled to 3d-gravity via fermions, the interest-
ing result we get concerns the 1-loop generation of dynamics for the longi-
tudinal component of such a eld: a massive and physical pole is induced as
a byproduct of the coupling between torsion and the fermionic matter that
also couples to the 2-form gauge potential.

as a general conclusion from our analisys we state that torsion sets the

stage for dynamical mass generation for bosonic elds in 3d.
