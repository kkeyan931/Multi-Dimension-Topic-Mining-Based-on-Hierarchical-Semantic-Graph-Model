abstract

we investigate the worldvolume actions of massive iia d-branes (i.e. d-branes in a

massive iia background) and obtain explicitly in each case a supersymmetric point charge

solution of the worldvolume gauge eld with an appropriate excitation of the transverse

scalar eld. aected by the background, the form of one of the solutions is very unusual.

however, we show that the regularized energy of each solution is proportional to the

geodesic distance from the d-brane to the point parametrized by the regularized value of

the scalar eld, revealing that these solutions correspond to fundamental strings ending

on the d-branes. the string tension is obtained correctly. the massless limit of the

solutions can also be taken consistently. we conclude that the way of describing one of

intersecting branes as a worldvolume solution of another brane has nontrivial target-

space covariance.

1 introduction

to gain better understanding of string theories and m-theory, intersecting branes have

played an important role and have been studied from various points of view. among

them, worldvolume analyses have been powerful approaches to investigate the intersecting

branes[1][2][3][4][5]. in ref.[1][2][3] worldvolume eld theories of branes in at backgrounds

were examined and solutions of the theories with nontrivial congurations of gauge elds

were obtained.

in the case of d-branes, it was shown that an appropriate excitation

of one of the transverse scalar elds is needed in order to obtain a supersymmetric (i.e.

bps) point charge solution of the worldvolume gauge eld[1]. each of the solutions

was interpreted as a fundamental string ending on the d-brane because the regularized

energy of each solution is proportional to the regularized value of the scalar eld, which is
considered to be the length of the string. this interpretation is consistent with the charge
conservation suggested in ref.[6] (see also ref.[7]). these analyses are very important in

that they made clear how the intersecting branes are described from the viewpoint of

another branes worldvolumes. after their work, many other solutions of worldvolume

theories of branes were discussed in at backgrounds (e.g. [8][9][10]).

in this paper we investigate these analyses further. we consider the case of d-branes in
a curved background. suppose that we construct a supersymmetric point charge solution
of the d-branes worldvolume with an appropriate excitation of one of its transverse

scalar elds. then, on the analogy of the case given in ref.[1], it is expected that the

solution corresponds to a fundamental string ending on the d-brane. however, since

the background spacetime is curved, the distance of two points should be measure not

by the simple dierence of the coordinates, but by their geodesic distance. so, if the

above expectation is true, the (regularized) energy of the solution in this case should be

proportional to the geodesic distance from the brane to the point parametrized by the

(regularized) value of the scalar eld. the purpose of this paper is to examine this

nontrivial target-space covariance of the worldvolume description of intersecting branes

(i.e. the way of describing one of intersecting branes as a worldvolume solution of another

brane), by constructing the point charge solutions and investigating the relation of their

energies with the values of the scalar elds.

to be concrete, the background of d-branes we choose here is a 10-dimensional (10d)

massive iia supergravity background[17][18]. that is, we construct point charge solu-

the energies of the point charge solutions are innite. so, (ir) regularization is needed to calculate

them.

some worldvolume solutions of branes in a curved (brane) backgrounds are discussed for other pur-

poses in ref.[11][12][13][14][15][16]

tions of 10d massive iia d-branes. the massive iia supergravity[17][18] is the eld

theory limit of the 10d type iia string theory with the non-vanishing r-r 10-form eld
strength f (10)[19]. the latter together with the former are called massive iia theory.
(this massive iia supergravity has a non-vanishing cosmological constant[17][18] propor-

tional to the square of a mass parameter. so, the branes we consider are in a curved

spacetime. we note that the usual massless iia theory can be obtained from the mas-

sive iia theory by taking the massless limit.) this massive theory is very problematic

in that the covariant 11-dimensional (i.e. m-theoretic) origin of the massive iia theory

has not yet been understood completely[20] (although its non-covariant 11d origin has

been proposed[21][22]). since the solutions of 10d massive iia d-brane worldvolumes

(corresponding to iia branes) should have their m-theoretic origins[23][24], to investigate

the solutions is useful not only in examining the target-space covariance of the worldvol-

ume description, but also in exploring the m-theoretic origin of the massive theory. this

is the reason to choose the massive background. (we will present the results about the

m-theoretic origin from the obtained solutions in the next paper.)

concrete procedures are as follows: we adopt a d-8-brane solution[25][18] as the

massive iia background of the d-branes. then, the d-8-brane has the only one transverse

space in the 10 dimensions, of course, while at least one overall transverse space is needed

after embedding another d-branes worldvolumes in order to obtain supersymmetric point

charge solutions. in the case of a d-2-brane (a d-6-brane), only the intersection with the

background d-8-brane on a string (a 5-brane) leads to the preservation of supersymmetry.

however, there is no overall transverse space in this case. so, we consider the two cases

of worldvolume theories: a d-4-brane and a d-8-brane parallel to the background d-
8-brane, which preserve at this moment 1/4 and 1/2 supersymmetry, respectively.
each case we construct explicitly the point charge solution with an appropriate excitation

in

of the only overall transverse scalar eld. we check the consistency of the solution by

discussing its massless limit. then, we calculate the energy of each solution by introducing

a regularization parameter, and show that the energy is proportional to the geodesic

distance from the d-brane to the point parametrized by the value of the scalar. based

on the proportional relation, we also discuss the tension of the string. finally, we derive

preserved supersymmetry of the each solution by using superalgebras in the massive
background via brane probes derived in ref.[26].

the organization of this paper is as follows: in section 2 we construct point charge

solutions of 10d massive iia d-brane worldvolumes and derive the proportional relations

 d-0-brane is not adequate to this worldvolume description since there is no world space.
 in the previous paper[12] we have conrmed that the supersymmetry preserved in the solution of

branes worldvolume can be derived via superalgebras in brane backgrounds (see also [27]).

of their energies with the geodesic distances. in section 3 we present some discussion and

conclusion.

before starting discussions, we present notations in this paper. we use mostly plus
metrics for both spacetime and worldvolumes, and use majorana (32 32) representation
for spinors. we denote coordinates of each p-branes worldvolume as i, j, .. (i,j,=0,1,..,p),
10-dimensional spacetime as xm, xn, .. (m,n=0,..,9), fermionic coordinates as , , .., su-
perspace as z m (= (xm, )). we use hatted letters ( m , m, ..) for all the local lorentz
frame indices and underbarred letters (m, i) for spatial indices (but not time one), respec-
tively. we denote gamma matrices as  m, which are all real and satisfy { m, n} = 2 mn.
0 is antisymmetric and others symmetric. charge conjugation is c = 0.

2 point charge solutions of 10d massive iia d-brane

worldvolumes

in this section we rst discuss a point charge solution of a d-4-brane worldvolume in a

10d massive iia background. the action takes the form[28]

sd4 = sbi

d4 = z d5eqdet(gij + fij)

d4 + sw z

j  mn is the induced worldvolume metric. (e m

where gij = e m

e n
m is the supervielbein.)  is the dilaton eld and fij are the components of a modied
worldvolume 2-form eld strength

i = iz m e m

f = dv  b2

(2.2)

of the worldvolume 1-form gauge eld v where b2 is the worldvolume 2-form induced
by the superspace ns-ns 2-form gauge potential b2. c (r) are the worldvolume r-forms
induced by the superspace r-r r-form gauge potentials c (r). m is a mass parameter
which is the dual of the 10-form eld strength f (10) of a r-r 9-form c (9)[18].

we take the background of the action (2.1) to be the d-8-brane solution given by[25][18]

ds2 = h /2dxdx + h 5/22dy2
e = h 5/4

c (9)

018 = h 

(2.3)

where x and x (, =0,..,8 ) are the spacetime coordinates parallel to the d-8-brane and
y is the single transverse coordinate.  is a nonzero parameter which cannot be determined

4

by the equations of motions of 10d massive iia supergravity. we note that the solution
(2.3) with  = 1 is the standard form of the d-8-brane solution since it is obtained via
t-duality from the other d-p-brane solutions[18]. h = h(y) is a harmonic function on

y. in this paper we set

h(y) = c1 +

m

|||y|,

(2.4)

which means that the d-8-brane lies at y = 0. we choose c1 > 0 and m > 0 to avoid a
singularity at y = 0 and to get a real dilaton. we note that the solution (2.3) becomes

the at spacetime metric in the massless limit

( m  0
c1  1 ( via dieomorphism).

(2.5)

the killing spinor of (2.3) has the form  = h /80 where 0 has a denite chirality,
i.e. y0 = +0 for y > 0 and y0 = 0 for y < 0. in this paper we concentrate the
discussions on the region y > 0.

since the solutions we construct here is a bosonic one, we set fermionic coordinates

 to be zero. then, when the background is xed to (2.3), the rst three terms of the

wess-zumino term in the action (2.1) do not contribute to the equations of motion.

moreover, we consider the ansatz



where r is dened as r  q4

xi = i
x5, x6, x7, x8 :
y = y(r) > 0
v0 = v0(r),

(i = 0, 1,   , 4)
constant

vi = 0

(2.6)

i=1(i)2. we note that the upper two columns of (2.6) mean
that the d-4-brane is embedded in the 1234-hyperplane. since the spatial components of
the gauge eld vi is set to zero, the last term of the wess-zumino term does not contribute
to the equations of motion, too. then, the equations of motion we solve are

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

so, let us examine more about the bi-action. the induced worldvolume metric gij is

given by

gij =   h /2

0

0

h /2  [ij + h 32iyjy] ! ,

(2.10)

leading to the determinant: detgij = h 5/2[1 + h 32(y)2]. at this moment, the deter-
minant of (gij +fij) in the born-infeld action (2.1) is very complicated. however, setting
the condition

iy = iv0,

(2.11)

results in the simple form of the determinant: det(gij +fij) = h 5/2.k then, the equations
of motion (2.7)(2.9) become the following two simple equations

i(h 32iy) = 0

i(h 21iy) = 0.

xi
xi

(2.12)

(2.13)

((2.12) arises from (2.8), (2.13) from the time component of (2.9), and the others are
solved.) so, requiring the two equations to be compatible, it needs to hold  = 1, and
the two are combined into one equation

i(hiy) = 0.

xi

(2.14)

we note that the harmonic function gives nontrivial contribution to the (2.14), which

means that the equations of motion of the d-4-brane worldvolume are aected by the

background d-8-brane. by using (2.4) and y > 0, we have the equation (2.14):

(i)2(y +

c1
m

)2 = 0.

xi

we choose the boundary condition

( y  y0 (> 0)
v0  0

(2.15)

(2.16)

for r  , which means that the d-4-brane lies at y = y0. then, the solution is obtained,
with the following unusual form, as

y(r) = [(

v0 = [(

c2

(2.17)

where c2 is a constant proportional to the electric charge of the gauge eld. the electric
charge is dened as [3]

q = zs3

d

(2.18)

equations of motion at least explicitly due to their nonlinearity.

k without the condition (2.11), det(gij + fij) remains very complicated and we cannot solve the
 strictly speaking, our denition of the electric charge is slightly dierent from that in ref.[3].

where sn is the n-sphere,  is the worldvolume hodge dual and d is the 2-form dened
as

then, we have

dij = 

sd4
fij

.

q = zs3

(hdv ) = mc23

(2.19)

(2.20)

where n is the volume of the unit n-sphere.

before discussing the energy of the solution (2.17), we check consistency of the solution

(2.17) by discussing the massless limit of it. if we take the massless limit (2.5), the solution

(2.17) with (2.20) behaves as

q

2c13r2

y  y0 +
q
v0 

2c13r2

.

(2.21)

the right hand side of (2.21) is the usual point charge solution of the worldvolume theory

of a d-4-brane in the 10d at spacetime. thus, although the form of the solution (2.17)

looks unusual, we can say that it is a consistent solution.

at length, we calculate the energy of the solution (2.17). the energy is innite in this

case, but if we regularize it by introducing a small parameter , we can get the energy for
r  . since the worldvolume (metric) is also curved, the energy should be dened as

e() = zm4

d4qg00 [p q  l]

(2.22)

where m4 is the world space of the d-4-brane. we note that the energy (2.22) is so
dened as to be invariant under reparametrization of 0.   then, it has the form

e() = z 



d4[h 1/4 + h 5/4(iy)2]  e1 + e2.

(2.23)

the rst term e1 is the energy of the d-4-brane, which is proportional to the target-space
volume of the d-4-branes world space. the second term e2 is the energy of the point
charge solution obtained as

e() = z d3z 



r3dr(c1 + my(r))5/4(iy)2

=

4q
5m

[{(c1 + my0)2 +

c2
2}5/8  (c1 + my0)5/4].

(2.24)

this denition is also consistent with the superalgebra appearing later.
 we would like to thank y. imamura for pointing out my mistake in calculating the energy.

7

on the other hand, the geodesic distance l from the d-4-brane (lying at y0) to the point
parametrized by y(r = ) is

l(y(); y0)  z y()

gyydy

y0
4
5

=

m1/4[(y() +

c1
m

)5/4  (y0 +

c1
m

)5/4].

so, we obtain the proportion relation:

e() = q  l(y(); y0)

(2.25)

(2.26)

therefore, we conclude that the solution (2.17) is interpreted as a fundamental string

perpendicular to both the d-4-brane and the background d-8-brane! (the string is at-

tached only to the d-4-branes worldvolume.) since the relation (2.26) is independent of

the mass parameter m (which is determined by the background), the tension of the string

is not aected by the background. suppose that we redene the energy and the electric

charge of the solution as those used in ref.[1], i.e.

e 
q 

e

(2)4g

q

(2)3

(2.27)

where g is the string coupling we have omitted until now. then, making use of the charge
quantization condition on the electric ux q = g (also presented in ref.[1]), we can obtain
the string tension correctly as

tf =

1
2

.

(2.28)

on the basis of the interpretation, the solution corresponds to the following intersection

of three branes:

as a nal discussion of the d-4-brane case, we consider the preserved supersymmetry

of the solution. on the basis of the above interpretation, 1/8 supersymmetry is expected

to be preserved. we show this by using superalgebras in brane backgrounds via brane

probes given in ref.[27][26][12]

the superalgebra in a d-8 brane background via a d-4-brane probe is given in ref.

2 q is the supercharge preserved in (2.3). p (0)i is almost the conjugate
where q+

stituting the solution for the right hand side of (2.29), the superalgebra can be written

d4 [h 1/4(

)].(2.30)

since the three gamma matrix products y,c123411 and cy11 (arising in (2.30)) com-
mute with each other, all of them can be simultaneously diagonalized. since the square

of each matrix product is equal to the identity and each is traceless, both of the matrices
1+c123411

are projection operators. so, we conclude that the solution has

and 1+c y11

2

1/8 supersymmetry.

as another case of the massive iia d-brane, we consider a d-8-brane in the massive

iia background (2.3). the action is

sd8 = sbi

d8 + sw z
+z ( c (r)ef|9form +

5!

d8 = z d9eqdet(gij + fij)

v (dv )4)).

(2.31)

in this case, we consider the ansatz

xi = i
y = y(r)(> 0)
v0 = v0(r),

(i = 0, 1,   , 8)
vi = 0.




where r is dened as r  qp8

i=1(i)2. the rst column means that the d-8-brane is
embedded parallel to the background d-8-brane. then, combined with  = 0, only the
term including c (9) of the wess-zumino term do contribute to the equations of motion
( c (9)
01..8 = h ). the expression of the induced worldvolume metric gij is the same as (2.10)
except for the range of the indices (i, j = 1, 2, .., 8). setting the same condition as (2.11)
makes the determinant of (gij +fij) simple, such as det(gij +fij) = h 9/2. then, we nd
the equations of motion

xi
xi

i(h 22iy) = 0

i(h 1iy) = 0.

9

(2.32)

(2.33)

thus, these two equations are compatible only if  = 1 (which is the same condition as
that in the d-4-brane case). the equations to solve become a single equation

(i)2y = 0.

xi

(2.34)

unlike the d-4-brane case, the harmonic function h does not appear in (2.34). that is,

the solution in this case is not aected by the background (i.e. independent of the mass

parameter). so, choosing the same boundary condition as (2.16), the solution is obtained

easily, as

c
2
r6

y = y0 +

v0 =

c
2
r6

(2.35)

where c
2 is a constant proportional to the electric charge of the solution. we note that
the form of this point charge solution (2.35) is completely the same as the usual point

charge solution of the d-8-brane worldvolume in the at background. using (2.18) and
(2.19), we have the electric charge q:

q = zs7

(dv ) = 6c

27.

next, we calculate the energy of the solution (2.35). it is given as

e() = zm8
= zm8

d8qg00 [p q  l]
d8[h 3/4 + h 1/4(iy)2]  e

1 + e
2.

(2.36)

(2.37)

where m8 is the world space of the d-8-brane (but not that of the background d-8-brane).
the rst term e
1 is the energy of the d-8-branes worldvolume, which is proportional to
the target-space volume of the d-8-branes world space. the second term e
2, the energy
of the point charge solution, is obtained as

e() = z d7z 



r7dr(c1 + my(r))1/4(iy)2

= q  l(y(); y0)

(2.38)

where l(y(); y0) is the geodesic distance from the d-8-brane lying at y0 to the point
parametrized by y(r = ), dened in the same way as (2.25). so, we conclude that the

solution also corresponds to a fundamental string perpendicular to the two d-8-branes

(though the string is attached only to the one of them). making the same redenition of

the energy and the electric charge of the solution (2.35) as done in the d-4-brane case,

10

the string tension (2.28) can be correctly obtained again. we note that the energy of the

solution is proportional not to the dierence but to the geodesic distance, although the

form of the solution is the same as that in the at background. the dierence comes from
the value of g00 (in this case g00 6= 1). on the basis of the interpretation, the solution
(2.35) corresponds to the following intersection of three branes:

background d8:
worldvolume d4:

finally, we derive the preserved supersymmetry of the solution (2.35) in the same

way. based on the above spacetime interpretation, 1/4 supersymmetry is expected to be

preserved. the superalgebra in a d-8 brane background via a d-8-brane probe is[26]

(2.41)

for the same reason stated in the discussion of the supersymmetry preserved in the d-

4-brane case, (2.41) means that 1/4 supersymmetry is preserved in this conguration,

which is consistent with the spacetime interpretation.

3 discussion and conclusion

in summary, in this paper we have investigated the worldvolume action of a d-4-brane and

a d-8-brane parallel to the background d-8-brane, and obtained explicitly supersymmetric

point charge solutions of the worldvolume gauge elds with appropriate excitations of the

only overall transverse scalar elds. we have shown that the regularized energy of each

solution proportional to the geodesic distance from the d-brane to the point parametrized

11

by the regularized value of the scalar eld. so, we conclude that these solutions correspond

to fundamental strings ending on the d-branes worldvolumes. the tension of the string

have been correctly reproduced.

finally, we consider the implication of the results obtained above, by discussing the d-

4-brane case in particular, in which the solution has a unusual form. in the massless limit,

the solution of the unusual form approaches to the usual point charge solution of the d-
brane in the 10d at spacetime, while keeping the proportional relation e = tf  l, where
l is the geodesic distance, i.e. target-space covariant quantity. so, it is concluded that the

unusual form of the solution (corresponding to string) originates from the requirement for

the solution to have such target-space covariance. in other words, we can say that the

way of describing one of intersecting branes as a worldvolume solution of another brane

has nontrivial target-space covariance.

like to thank y. imamura for pointing out my mistake in computing the energy of the

solution.
