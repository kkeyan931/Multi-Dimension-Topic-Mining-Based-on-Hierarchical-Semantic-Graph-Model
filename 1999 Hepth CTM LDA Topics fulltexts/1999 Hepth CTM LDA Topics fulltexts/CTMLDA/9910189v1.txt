abstract

open systems acquire time-dependent coupling constants through interaction
with an external eld or environment. we generalize the lewis-riesenfeld in-
variant theorem to open system of quantum elds after second quantization.
the generalized invariants and thereby the quantum evolution are found ex-
plicitly for time-dependent quadratic fermionic systems. the pair production
of fermions is computed and other physical implications are discussed.

the dynamical evolution of the universe in time has to be examined carefully to un-
derstand the phase transitions that are crucial to the cosmological scenarios. the phase
transition may be aecting topologically unstable structures in the universe and these may
have important consequences for the inationary universe. the observational aspects like
baryon asymmetry may require the presence of time-dependent gauge elds. the time evolu-
tion of the universe would require that both scalar and fermionic elds are time dependent
through their interactions with the gravity. furthermore one may need to calculate the
pair production of fermions due to the oscillating inatons. this may provide a possible
mechanism for preheating mechanism for fermionic systems.

all these time-dependent processes in the universe would be happening when the system
is not in equilibrium and there is no xed temperature. we have a system that is time-
dependent and in a non-equilibrium state. similar time-dependent and rapidly varying
processes in the laboratory, that simulate the conditions at the early evolutionary stage
of the universe, relate to the heavy ion reactions at the relativistic heavy ion facility at
brookhaven.
it is intended that in colliding heavy ion (u on u) reactions there will be
a deconning phase transition from nucleonic to a quark-gluon system that exists for a
very brief period of time before making a phase transition back to the baryonic matter.
the time evolution of the formation and dissolution of the quark-gluon plasma is a highly
non-equilibrium process that requires a careful consideration of the time dependence of the
coupling of both the fermionic and bosonic systems.

the coupling constants or parameters of a system depend on time implicitly through the
interaction when it interacts with an environment. any system whose coupling constants
or parameters depend on time explicitly can be regarded as a subsystem of a larger closed
system and belongs to an open system. to describe properly the quantum states of such
open system one may nd the evolution of the system plus environment and integrate out the
degrees of freedom corresponding to the environment. or one may rely on eld theoretical
methods such as closed time path integral [1] or thermo eld dynamics [2].

even though the thermo eld dynamics is a real time operator formalism it has not been
applied to a real problem to investigate the time evolution. hence we choose instead to use
the functional schrodinger picture approach [3]. it is conceivable that this may provide some
help in using the thermo eld dynamics. even the quantum evolution of a time-dependent
system has also been an outstanding problem in quantum mechanics. a frequently used
method is to nd trial wave functions (a variational approach) with undetermined time-
dependent coecients and to x these coecients by solving the schrodinger equation.
lewis and riesenfeld introduced a systematic method to nd the operators that satisfy the
quantum liouville-von neumann equation and to solve for the exact quantum states as their
eigenstates [4]. this method has been applied successfully to some of the time-dependent
systems, in particular, the harmonic oscillator systems.

the lewis-riesenfeld invariant theorem has been applied successfully [5] to study the
quantum evolution of scalar elds in an expanding friedman-robertson-walker universe. a
variety of results were obtained including the vacuum state and the wightman functions
with respect to the vacuum, thermal equilibrium and coherent states. however, as suggested
above the overall evolution of the universe would require not only the time dependence of the
scalar eld but also that of a fermion eld. since the fermion eld is a four component spinor,
it appears natural to use the lewis-riesenfeld invariant theorem to the fermion eld taking

2

proper account of the fact that the spinor components lead to a set of coupled equations. the
usual procedure of writing the spinor eld in terms of creation and annihilation operators
is adopted. the results of quantum evolution of the fermion eld are presented. we give
a brief overview of the application to the scalar eld and then a detailed account of the
method as applied to the fermion system is given.

the open system of the quantum eld is described by the functional schrodinger equation

[3]

i



t|(, t)i = h(,i




, t)|(, t)i,

(1)

where  represents a scalar or fermion eld. our stratagem is to express the hamiltonian in
the second quantization as a sum of innite number of nite dimensional quantum systems,
which are decoupled or coupled depending on the type of interactions. and then we apply
the lewis-riesenfeld theorem to each nite dimensional system and nd the generalized
invariants and thereby the evolution of the second quantized hamiltonian.

according to the lewis-riesenfeld invariant theorem, the invariant operator satisfying

the liouville-von neumann equation for a time-dependent hamiltonian h(t)

i

d
dt

o(t) = i


t

o(t) + [ o(t), h(t)] = 0,

has time-dependent eigenstates and time-independent eigenvalues

and the exact quantum evolution of the system

o(t)|n, ti = n|n, ti.

i



t|(t)i = h(t)|(t)i,

(2)

(3)

(4)

is given by a superposition of states |n, ti, up to time-dependent phase factors.
the theorem was originally proved by lewis and riesenfeld and applied to a time-
dependent harmonic oscillator [4]. we now give a simple proof of the theorem. one can
apply the operator eq. (2) to the eigenstates |n, ti given by eq. (3) and rst show that

t n = 0, and then obtain the following identity

(cid:16) o(t)  n i(cid:17)h(cid:16)i



t  h(t)(cid:17)|n, tii = 0.

(5)

here, we use the eigenvalue equation (3) and i denotes the identity operator. this implies
that the quantity in the square bracket should belong to the kernal of the operator in the
parenthesis, that is |n, ti:



t  h(t)(cid:17)|n, ti = n(t)|n, ti.

(cid:16)i

then it follows readily that

n(t) = hn, t|(cid:16)i



t  h(t)(cid:17)|n, ti,

3

(6)

(7)

and the quantum state

|n, ti = eir n(t)|n, ti,

(8)

is an exact solution of eq. (4). the most general state is a superposition of states like the
ones given by eq. (8).

it should be pointed out that the lewis-riesenfeld theorem can also be applied to innite-
dimensional quantum systems such as the quantum elds when they are expressed as a sum
of nite dimensional systems. the second quantized hamiltonian of quantum elds has
such a form. another important observation is that the theorem can also be applied to
bosonic or fermionic systems when the commutators or anticommutators are appropriately
used for boson and fermion operators, respectively. we shall consider a scalar eld with a
time-dependent mass and a time-dependent fermion system with the most general quadratic
form as open systems.

the creation and annihilation operators for each mode satisfy the usual commutation relation

superposition of these number states as given by eq. (8), and the wave function for the
scalar eld is the product of these quantum states.

we now generalize the quadratic form of eq. (10) to a fermionic system by dening the

(21)

and all the other anticommutators vanish. so the hamiltonian given by eq. (20) describes
a system bilinear in the fermion elds. the unitarity of quantum evolution requires the
hermiticity of the hamiltonian which leads to the conditions

by eliminating either u(t) or v(t) in eq.

(27) we obtain the second order dierential

one can make b(t), d(t) and their hermitian conjugates the annihilation and creation

operators that satisfy the anticommutators at each time

these lead to the consistency condition for the coecient functions

the consistency of anticommutators for all times is guaranteed by



t(cid:16)u (b)(t)u (b)(t) + v (b)(t)v (b)(t)(cid:17) = 0,
t(cid:16)u (d)(t)u (d)(t) + v (d)(t)v (b)(t)(cid:17) = 0,

t(cid:16)u (b)(t)3u (b)(t) + v (b)(t)3v (b)(t)(cid:17) = 0,
t(cid:16)u (d)(t)3u (d)(t) + v (d)(t)3v (b)(t)(cid:17) = 0,
u(t)3 = mv(t) is used. still other anticommutators

where 3m t

{ b(t), d(t)} = { b
{ b(t), d

are also satised for all times due to

(35)

(36)

(37)

since the b(t), b

(t) share the same properties of the annihilation
and creation operators for time-independent system, they will be used as those for time-
dependent system. so the number operators are dened by

(t) and d(t), d

n (d)

 (t) = d

(38)

the eigenstates for each mode are the number states of n (b)
the zero-particle state for n (b)

 (t) is given by

 (t) or n (d)

 (t). for instance,

 , 0(d)

0 (t)|0(b)

 i + c(b)

 , ti = c(b)
|0(b)

0 (t)|1(b)
where |n(b), n(d)i are the number states with respect to b

 , 1(d)
 i,

1 (t)|1(b)
d, respectively, and

(39)

(40)

one-particle state is constructed by applying the operator b
(t) to the zero-particle state
(eq. (39)). the number states of the antiparticle can be similarly constructed by using the
number operator n (d)
 (t). these states in general depend on time, but their eigenvalues
(occupation numbers) do not depend on time as expected according to the lewis-riesenfeld
theorem. the vacuum state is the one that is annihilated by all the annihilation operators
b(t) and d(t):

b(t)|0, 0, ti = d(t)|0, 0, ti = 0.

(41)

when the interaction is turned on for a nite period of time or the system evolves from an
asymptotic region where all the  are constants and eq. (41) coincides with the minkowski
vacuum, the pair production of fermions from the initial vacuum is given by

walker universe has the same form of hamiltonian as eq. (43) [6].

a few comments are in order. the generalized invariants in eq. (30) for the hamiltonian
given by eq. (20) are more general than those for eq. (43), since b(t) involves only b and
d, then eq.
d
 and d(t) involve only b
(30) is the unique choice compatible with the algebra. furthermore, eq. (42), when restricted
to eq. (43) gives the same result for the pair production as other quantum eld theories.
one may also extend the analysis to the fermion interacting with an electromagnectic eld
by introducing a hamiltonian that is similar in form to eq. (20) but involves dirac matrices
 in a coupling with the time dependent coecient (t).

one of the important issues not treated in this paper is the non-equilibrium aspect of
open system of quantum elds. this can be done by introducing a density operator of the
form (t) = e( n
 (t)), which satises the liouville-von neumann equation by its
construction, which will be addressed in a future publication. one of the applications of the

result of this paper is the evolution of fermions in an expanding universe, where fermions
gain time-dependence through the interaction with the gravity. the other is to calculate the
pair production rate of fermions due to the oscillating inaton and to provide a preheating
mechanism for the fermionic system. finally the time evolution of the quark-gluon plasma in
a relativistic heavy ion collision would simulate the conditions present at the early moments
of the univese and would thus provide us with an experimental view of the evolution of the
universe.
