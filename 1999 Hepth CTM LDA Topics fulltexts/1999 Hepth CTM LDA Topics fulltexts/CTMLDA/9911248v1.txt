abstract

the casimir energy of a non-uniform string built up from two pieces with
dierent speed of sound is calculated. a standard procedure of subtracting
the energy of an innite uniform string is applied, the subtraction being in-
terpreted as the renormalization of the string tension. it is shown that in the
case of a homogeneous string this method is completely equivalent to the zeta
renormalization.

i. introduction

in the standard setting of the casimir eect problem, a bounded conguration space of
the quantum eld system is considered [1,2]. however unbounded conguration space can be
nonhomogeneous, i.e., it can consist from separate regions endowed with dierent physical
characteristics. in the case of electromagnetic eld such caracteristics are permittivity  and
permiability  of the media. it is obvious that the vacuum energy should depend on the
conguration of these nonhomogenities. hence the problem on nding out this dependence,
i.e. on calculation of the casimir energy, can be set.

when calculating the vacuum energy it proves to be essential whether the velocity of
light (in the general case the velocity of relevant quanta) is continuous when crossing the
interface between regions with dierent characteristics. from a mathematical stand point
the constant velocity of light implies that the coecients of the higher (usually the second)
derivatives in the corresponding dynamical equation are continuous functions in space. if it
is the case then the calculation of the casimir energy (or the casimir forces) turns out to
be practically the same as for an empty space with a perfectly conducting shell having the
shape of the interface between media [38].

the discontinuity of the speed of light on the boundaries between dierent regions results
in considerable mathematical diculties. certain results have been obtained here only
recently. the casimir energy was calculated for a compact dilute dielectric ball proceeding
from the greens function formalism and employing the naive zeta function technique for
removal of the divergences without detailed procedure of analytic continuation [912]. it
was assumed that the dierence of the light velocities inside (c1) and outside (c2) is small
and only the term proportional to (c1 c2)2 in the casimir energy has been kept. in ref. [13]
it was shown that the heat kernel coecient a2, responsible for the pole contribution to the
casimir energy, vanishes in this approximation (it proves to be proportional to (c1  c2)3).
this implies that the complete zeta regularization should provide a nite answer in this
problem.

in calculations accomplished in refs. [9,10,12] a key role was played by the so called
contact terms which cannot be incorporated in the standard zeta function technique at least
in a straightforward way. their physical origin is still unclear.

thus it is worth investigating these problems in the framework of a more simple model.
such a model, preserving all essential features of eld theory, is a string built up from two
pieces which have dierent velocities of sound (the velocities of vibration propagation). in
papers by i. brevik and co-authorths [1416] a piecewise uniform string, with the same
velocity of sound at each of its constituents, has been studied. such string model is a
one-dimensional analog of the electromagnetic eld in media obeying the condition  =
c2, where c is the constant velocity of light. in this model the casimir energy has been
investigated in detail both at zero and nite temperature.

the present paper seeks to calculate the casimir energy of a nonuniform open string
of total length r, which is built up of the pieces of length r and r  r having the sound
velocities v1 and v2 respectively. at the joint point (x = r) the continuity of the string shape
and its tangents is imposed. the string ends x = 0 and x = r are subjected to the dirichlet
or neumann boundary conditions. the equations dening the eigenfrequencies of the string
are derived. this material is presented in sect. ii. proceeding from this in sect. iii the

2

casimir energy of the string is calculated by making use of the mode-by-mode summation
method [7,5], which relies on the contour integration. the renormalization of the string
tension by subtracting the energy of an innite uniform string enables one to remove the
divergences in a unique way. it is shown that in the limit r   the casimir energy of the
string does not depend on the boundary conditions imposed at x = r and is expressed in
terms of the polylogarithm function. in the conclusion (sect. iv) the results obtained are
discussed briey. in the appendix it is shown that the subtraction procedure employed in
the paper is equivalent to the zeta renormalization when considering a usual uniform string.

ii. classical dynamics of a non-uniform string

the model we are considering is a string built up from two pieces of length r and r  r
and endowed with the sound velocities v1 and v2, respectively. the string is stretched along
the x 1 axis (which we shall denote by x in what follows) and can vibrate in d  2 transverse
dimensions x 2 . . . x d. the both pieces of the string satisfy the wave equation

2x i
x2 = 0,

j = 1, 2,

i = 2, 3, . . . , d .

(2.1)

at the ends the string is subjected to the boundary conditions, which we shall take to be of
either dirichlet or neumann type. consequently, we shall consider four cases:

x i(t, 0) = 0, x i(t, r) = 0,

(dd),

x i(t, 0) = 0,

(2.2)

i = 2, . . . , d .

at the joining point x = r we impose the continuity conditions

(2.3)

the wave equations (2.1) together with the boundary conditions (2.2) and the continuity
conditions (2.3) lead to the equations which determine the eigenfrequencies of the string 

f1() = sin() + v sin() = 0,
f2() = cos()  v cos() = 0,
f3() = cos() + v cos() = 0,
f4() = sin()  v sin() = 0,

iii. ground state energy of the string and its

renormalization

when calculating the casimir energy, the main problem encountered here is the removal
of the divergences, which arise inevitably in such calculations. in quantum eld theory [17]
this procedure is accomplished in the course of the renormalization of the physical param-
eters, which specify the eld theory model under investigation (the masses of the quanta,
coupling constants an so on). in order for this procedure to be correct from mathematical
stand point, divergent expressions should be regularized, the regularization being removed
after renormalization.

we dene the renormalized casimir energy in a standard way [1]

ec =

1

2 xn

(n  n) ,

(3.1)

where the s are the eigenfrequencies of the string, i.e., the roots of the frequency equa-
tions (2.2), and the s are the roots of the same equations but in the limit when the total
string length r and r tend to innity, and the dierence of the velocities v tends to zero.
hence in this limit the initial string becomes a uniform innite string. in quantum eld
theory this implies the removal of the minkowski space contribution [1]. in the appendix it
is shown that the method of calculation of the vacuum energy, outlined above, is completely
equivalent to the zeta regularization in the case of usual uniform string.

it is convenient to represent the sum (3.1) in terms of the contour integral [18]

ec =

d  2

4i ic

dz z

d
dz

ln

f (z)
f (z)

,

(3.2)

where the function f (z) is any function fl(z),
l = 1, . . . , 4 dening the frequency equations
in (2.4), and f is obtained from f when passing to the limit described above. the contour
c encloses all the positive roots of the equation f () = 0. this contour can be deformed
into the semicircle c of radius  in the right half-plane and the interval of the imaginary
axes (i, i). when the radius  is xed, the contour c encloses a nite number of the
roots of the equation f (z) = 0. the sum of these roots is obviously nite. hence the radius
 is a regularization parameter, and taking the limit    means the removal of the
regularization.

the subtraction in eq. (3.2) accomplished with the function f (z) can be interpreted
as the renormalization of the parameters which specify the classical energy of the string.
from the general consideration one can assume that this energy is proportional to the total
length of the string r, i.e., ecl = t  r, where t is a dimensional parameter [t ] = l2. it
is determined by a concrete string model that should certainly involve nonlinearities. for

4

example, in the relativistic string model [19] this parameter is the string tension. due to
the quantum corrections the string tension should be renormalized in the following way

t ren = t +

d  2

r

1

4i ic

dz z

d
dz

ln f (z).

(3.3)

after removing the regularization (  ) the integral in (3.3) obviously diverges. however
it is assumed that this divergence is canceled by the respective innity of the bare string
tension t . as a result the renormalized (physical) string tension t ren proves to be nite. here
we follow the standard procedure of removing the divergences in quantum eld theory [17]. in
l = 1, . . . , 4 on the semicircle c their
view of the oscillating behavior of the functions fl(z),
asymptotics for r   are simply these functions themselves, i.e., f l(z) = fl(z),
z  c.
therefore the integration along this part of the contour c does not give contribution into
the casimir energy (3.2). on the imaginary axes the asymptotics of the functions fl(z) when
r, r   can be nd easy

fl(z) 

ey

as a result we obtain the nal expression for the casimir energy

ec =

dy ln [hl(y)],

l = 1, . . . , 4

with the functions hl(y) given by

h1(y) = 1  e2y + 2v ey sinh(y),
h2(y) = 1 + e2y  2v ey cosh(y),
h3(y) = 1 + e2y + 2v ey cosh(y),
h4(y) = 1  e2y  2v ey sinh(y),

(dd),
(dn),
(nd),
(nn).

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

as a simple consistency check, we apply the formulas (3.5) and (3.6) to the uniform

string (v1 = v2  v) of length r with the expected result [20]

ec =

2 z

let us consider the string conguration, when the second piece of the string becomes

innitely long (i.e. r tends to innity, while r remains xed). then we have

h
1 (y) = h

these formulas imply that when r   the casimir energy becomes independent of the
type of the boundary condition imposed at x = r. certainly, this is an appealing property
of the vacuum energy of the string under consideration. for r   it is also possible to
obtain the explicit form of this energy

our consideration of non-uniform string can be generalized in a straightforward way to

the nite temperature. it can be done by the substitution [22]

dy  2

(3.9)

where  is the temperature, n = 2n are the matsubara frequencies, and the prime means
that the term n = 0 is taken with half weight and

iv. conclusion

the non-uniform string with nite r and r   is, in some sense, an analogue of
the radial part of the problem concerning the calculation of the vacuum energy of a pure
dielectric compact ball placed in a homogeneous unbounded medium or cavity in such a
medium [6,9]. the main lesson of our consideration is the following. when dening the
counter term in eq. (3.1), in order to renormalize the casimir energy, we take not only the
limit r, r   but also put v  0. it means that all the physical parameters, specifying
the problem under study, should be involved in determination of the counter term.

it is worth noting that we do not use here the contact terms in order to get a nite result

for the casimir energy.

appendix: riemann zeta function in the uniform string

model

the representation of the spectral zeta functions in terms of contour integrals, with the
integrands being the relevant frequency equations, is of wide use [13,23] this representation
is a direct application of the principle of argument theorem from the complex analysis [18,24].
however this theorem alone does not aord the required analytical continuation of the zeta
function. the details of this technique can be clearly demonstrated by considering the zeta
function for the usual uniform string. in this case we are dealing with the riemann zeta
function the analytic continuation of which is well known [18,24].

the eigenfrequencies of the uniform string of the length r with the dirichlet boundary

conditions

n =

n
r

, n = 1, 2, . . .

are the positive roots of the equation

sin(r) = 0.

(a1)

(a2)

for simplicity the velocity v is taken to be 1. let us dene the zeta function in the problem
at hand by the standard formula

(s) =



xn=1

s

n ,  s > 1.

(a3)

when r =  we obviously have the riemann zeta function.

now we represent the sum (a3) in terms of the contour integral

(s) =

1

2i ic

zs d
dz

ln[sin(zr)]dz ,

(a4)

where the contour c encloses all the positive roots of eq. (a2). the point z = 0 is the
branching point of the function zs = exp(s ln z) in eq. (a4). obviously this point should
be left outside the closed contour c in order to integrate one valued function. for the
logarithm we take as usual the branch acquiring real values on the positive half-axes 0 <
 z < . let us deform (still formally) the contour c in a semicircle of innitely large
radius laying in the right half-plane of the complex variable z and close it by imaginary axes
 <  z < . for  s > 1 the integration along the semicircle can be dropt. as a result
one gets

(s) =

=

1

r


sin(cid:18)s
sin(cid:18)s

2 (cid:19)z 
2 (cid:19)z 

0

0

dy ys d
dy

ln[sinh(yr)]

dy ys coth(yr) .

(a5)

(a6)

the integral in eq. (a6) converges at the upper limit only for  s > 1 and at the lower
limit for  s < 0. the latter is due to the singular behaviour  s of the integral along

7

the semicircle of innitely small radius  at the origin. this contribution vanishes only for
 s < 0. thus, in the general case the contour c in eq. (a4) cannot pass through the point
z = 0.

however this contour can be retained if we take, instead of eq. (a2), a new frequency

equation

sin(r)

r

= 0 ,

(a7)

which has the same positive roots as eq. (a2), but the point z = 0 does not satisfy it. as
a result we obtain, instead of eq. (a6),

(s) =

r


sin(cid:18) s

2 (cid:19)z 

0

dy ys coth(yr) 

1

yr! .

(a8)

this integral representation of the zeta function is dened for 1 < s < 2 and gives in fact
the same sum (a3) but with explicit substitution of the roots (a1). really, let us present
the function coth(yr) in eq. (a8) as a series (see, for example, eq. 1.4.21.4 in [25])

coth z =

1
z

+ 2z



xn=1

z2 + 2n2 .

after that integration in (a8) can be done

(a10)

thus the contour integration of the frequency equation (a2) or (a7) gives us nothing new
as compared with the sum (a3) with explicit frequencies (a1).

as known [18,24] analytic continuation of the series (a3) with r =  to the region

s < 1 is provided by the formula

r(s) =

i(1  s)

2

z (0+)



(z)s1
ez  1

dz .

(a11)

here r(z) is the riemann zeta function, and the path of integration encircles the real
positive axes 0   z  . when  s > 1 the integration contour around the origin can be
drawn to the point, and the remaining integral gives

r(s) =

1

(z) z 

0

xs1
ex  1

dx .

(a12)

expanding the function 1/(ex  1) in powers of ex and integrating each term we arrive at
the sum

8

r =



xn=1

1
ns ,  s > 1 .

(a13)

if  s < 1, the integral around the origin in eq. (a11) does not vanish, and it should be
taken into account when reducing the contour integral representation (a11) to the ordinary
integral (see, for example, [24]).

the riemann zeta function dened in the entire plane s, safe for the point s = 1, by the

contour integral (a11) obeys the riemann reection formula [18,24]

r(s) =

(2)s



sin(cid:18)s

2 (cid:19) (1  s)r(1  s) .

(a14)

this formula relates the values of the zeta function left and right from the line  s = 1. at
the point s = 1 the function r(s) has a simple pole

r(s)|s1 

1

s  1

+  ,

(a15)

where  is the euler constant. it is this pole that prevents the use of the denition (a13)
for  s < 1.

thus we see that even for analytic continuation of the simple sum (a13) a special choice
of the path and the integrand is needed. direct summation of the frequencies by contour
integration does not aord analytic continuation.

however if we dene the zeta function for a uniform string by subtracting the vacuum
energy of an innite string from eq. (a13), as it is usually done when calculating the casimir
energy (see eq. (3.1)), then the resulting zeta function proves to be the analytic function
for  s < 0 and exactly that function which follows from eq. (a11) or from the reection
formula (a14), that is the same.

so let us dene the zeta function in the following way

(s) =



xn (cid:16)s

n (cid:17) ,
n  s

(a16)

where the frequencies  are dened by eq. (a2) when r  . the corresponding limiting
form of this equation can be found unambiguously upon rotating the integration path to the
imaginary axes

lim
r

sinh(yr) =

eyr
2

.

now we apply eq. (a5) to the both terms in denition (a16)

(s) =

s


sin(cid:18)s

2 (cid:19)z 

0

ys1 ln(cid:16)1  e2yr(cid:17) dy .

(a17)

(a18)

here the integration by parts has been done, that is legitimated for  s < 0. expanding the
logarithm in (a18) in power series and integrating each term we obtain for  s < 0

9

(s) =

(2)s

n1s

sin(cid:18)s
sin(cid:18)s

xn=1

2 (cid:19) (1  s)
2 (cid:19) (1  s)(1  s) .

(a19)

it is exactly the same result that follows from the riemann reection formula (a14).

thus the analytic continuation of the riemann zeta function (a13) into the region  s <
1, which is given by eq. (a11), implies in essence that for  s < 1 one considers the initial
series (a13) with subtraction (a16). certainly for  s > 1 the new denition of the zeta
function (a16) cannot be reduced to the initial series (a13), hence it cannot play the role
of eq. (a11), i.e., it cannot aord, in a rigorous mathematical sense, analytic continuation
of the series (a13) to the region  s < 1. the new denition (a16) simply guesses the
result of analytic continuation of the rieman zeta function (a13) to this region.

to our opinion, this consideration shows, in a simple and clear way, the relationship
between the analytic continuation, providing the mathematical basis of the zeta renormal-
ization technique, and the method of subtraction or counter terms, widely used by physicists.
summarizing we arrive at the conclusion that the calculation of the casimir energy of a
non-uniform string in the present paper is completely equivalent to the zeta regularization
in the case of a usual uniform string.
