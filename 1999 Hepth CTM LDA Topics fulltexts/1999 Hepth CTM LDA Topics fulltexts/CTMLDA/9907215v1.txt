abstract

we examine string-theory orientifold planes of various types including the sp and so-

odd planes, and deduce the gravitational chern-simons couplings on their world-volumes.

consistency checks are carried out in dierent spacetime dimensions using various dualities,

including those relating string theory with f-theory and m-theory. it is shown that when

an orientifold 3-plane crosses a 5-brane, the jump in the charge is accompanied by a

corresponding change in the gravitational couplings.

1. introduction

topological or chern-simons couplings on dirichlet branes have played an important

role in string theory and the understanding of dualities. these couplings involve two kinds

of elds: elds arising in the bulk spacetime theory (from the rr or ns-ns sectors) and

elds coming from the brane worldvolume theory.

in particular, there are gravitational couplings of this kind involving only bulk elds,

namely the spacetime metric and various m-form potentials. schematically, they are of

three types:

z c  tr (r  r),

z c  (tr (r  r))2 ,

z c  tr (r  r  r  r)

(1.1)

in each expression, c is some m-form gauge potential where m is such that the term has

the correct rank to be integrated over the relevant brane world-volume. the second and

third terms involve 8-forms in the curvature, hence they arise only on p-branes for p  7.

we will refer to these as 8-form terms. the rst term occurs on all d p-branes for

3  p  9, and will be referred to as a 4-form term. the presence of such terms was

rst predicted (in a special case) in ref.[1] using duality. the general form was worked

out using an anomaly inow argument in ref.[2], and extended to the case of a twisted

normal bundle in ref.[3].

the above terms do not involve world-volume elds of the d-brane, so they can be

thought of as interactions among bulk elds that are localized on the brane. from this per-

spective, there is no reason why orientifold planes cannot have similar interactions residing

on them. indeed, it was rst observed in ref.[4] that orientifold planes indeed have grav-

itational 4-form and 8-form world-volume couplings, whose coecients were determined

using heterotictype-i duality. the presence of such interactions was tested in ref.[4,5]

using dualities involving m and f theory. in recent times, the presence of gravitational

couplings on both branes and planes has been conrmed by explicit perturbative string

computations[6]. in the case of orientifold planes, these authors also generalized the result

to a nontrivial normal bundle.

the orientifold planes considered in the above works are the ones that give rise to

dn gauge theories when branes coincide with them. they always carry a negative amount
of d-brane charge and are usually called op planes1. the purpose of this note is to

1 unfortunately, they are also sometimes called o+ planes[7]. we will not use this notation.

1

examine other kinds of orientifold planes from the perspective of world-volume gravitational

couplings. in particular, we will focus on the kind which give rise to cn or sp-type gauge

theories when branes coincide with them. these always carry a positive charge and will

be denoted op+ in what follows.

at least two other types of orientifold planes exist, but they have been observed only

in a few specic (low) dimensions. one of them, which produces so(2n + 1) type gauge

groups, consists of an op plane with a single d-brane stuck on it, and will be denoted eop.

the other type of plane is somewhat mysterious and gives rise to sp-type gauge groups,
but diers from the op+ plane mentioned above. following ref.[8], we will denote it op.

the d p-brane charge2 of an op plane is 2p5, while for the op+ plane it is 2p5.

2 in the dimensions where it exists, while for the
op plane the charge is known only in a few specic dimensions, as we will discuss below.

for the eop plane the charge is 2p5 + 1
the eop do not have simple transformation properties under t-duality, while the op and

op+ planes simply double each time we compactify on a circle and t-dualize. we will see
in one case that assuming this also for the o-plane leads to a consistent result.

2. gravitational couplings on o planes

the general formulae obtained in ref.[4] can be summarised as follows. an orientifold

p-plane of type op, for 3  p  9, has a gravitational 4-form coupling on its world-volume

given by

op :



2p9

3 z c rr

p3 

tr r  r
162 = 

2p9

6

z c rr

p3  p1

where p1, the rst pontryagin class of the manifold, is given by

p1(r) =

1
82 tr r  r

(2.1)

(2.2)

and c rr

p3 is the (p  3)-form ramond-ramond gauge potential. for comparison, a single

dp-brane carries the coupling

dp :

48z c rr

p3  p1

(2.3)

2 these charges are in units where a mirror pair of d-branes has charge +1.

2

this formula is unambiguous in the absence of orientifold planes. however, when an

orientifold plane is present, d-branes can only move around in mirror pairs. in this case,

a single d-brane of a mirror pair carries the coupling



1

96z c rr

p3  p1

(2.4)

in particular, in situations where half a d-brane is considered to be stuck at the orien-

tifold, this object carries the term in eq.(2.4).

for 7  p  9 there are also gravitational 8-form couplings[4]. an op plane carries

the coupling3

(2.9)

published version.

3

only the forms of the correct rank to be integrated over the brane or plane worldvolume

are retained in eq.(2.8). moreover, this formula is valid only when the normal bundle to

the world-volume is trivial. otherwise, we must make the replacements:

a(r) 

l(r/4) 

a(rt )
a(rn )
l(rt /4)
l(rn /4)

(2.10)

where rt and rn are the curvature 2-forms of the tangent and normal bundles respectively.

3. gravitational couplings on other o planes

let us now consider the other kinds of orientifold planes. recall that the above

results were originally derived in ref.[4] by appealing to heterotic/type-i duality and the

low-energy eective action of the heterotic string. the anomalous bianchi identity satised

by the heterotic string 3-form h = db can be dualized to a coupling



1

2 z b6  p1(r)

(3.1)

in the eective action of the heterotic string, where b6 is the dual potential to b, in other
words db6 = db where  is the hodge dual. dualizing to type i, b6 becomes an rr
6-form potential. requiring that this term comes from one o9 plane and 16 d9-branes,

and using the results of ref.[2] for gravitational couplings on d-branes, one nds the result
for the coupling on an o9 plane. finally, the fact that o planes split into two each
time we t-dualize gives the result for all o planes.

the same procedure works for 8-form couplings, except that this time the relevant

terms in the eective action come not from the anomalous bianchi identity but from the

green-schwarz cancellation mechanism.

if we want to deduce the gravitational couplings on sp-type orientifold planes op+, we

need to produce a string vacuum containing these planes, and where the relevant terms in

the eective action are known. a convenient example is the 8-dimensional compactication

discussed in ref.[7], dual to a toroidal compactication without vector structure. this has
three o7 planes and one o7+ plane, and 8 pairs of d7-branes. it is easy to see that
the terms that were used in ref.[4] to nd the gravitational couplings on o planes are

present in this 8-dimensional model with the same coecients as before. these terms arise

4

as higher derivative (or ) corrections in the tree-level eective action. the 8-dimensional

model in question can be dualized to a chl[9] type background for the heterotic string.

this corresponds to a z2 orbifold without a twisted sector, hence the tree-level couplings

of the b-eld and gravitons (which are all invariant under z2) are unchanged.

with this result it is straightforward to nd the 4-form and 8-form couplings on the

o7+ plane. in the present example, the 4-form coupling on three o7 planes, a o7+ plane

and 8 pairs of d7-branes must add up to the term in eq.(3.1). moreover, an o+ plane

also splits into two upon t-dualizing, like the o plane[7]. it follows that an op+ plane

(which exists for all p  8) carries the gravitational 4-form coupling:

op+ :



5.2p8

12

z c rr

p3  p1

(3.2)

we will check this result with various dualities below.

another type of orientifold plane that exists for p  8 will be denoted eop. this is the

plane that gives rise to gauge symmetries of type so(2n+1). it consists of a single d-brane

(sometimes called a half d-brane) stuck on an o plane. hence its gravitational 4-form

coupling is



2p5 + 1

96

z c rr

p3  p1

(3.3)

eop :

next let us turn to 8-form couplings. here, considerations analogous to the ones

discussed above lead to the expressions:

2p8z c rr
z c rr

p7 (cid:18) 9
p7 (cid:18) 2p6 + 1

5120

p2(cid:19)

2880
7.2p7 + 1

5760

(3.4)

p2(cid:19)

op+ :

eop :

it is straightforward to check, using the above expressions, that the 9-dimensional vacuum

containing three o7 planes, one o7+ plane and 8 pairs of d7-branes, has the total 8-form

term:

z rr (cid:18) 1

128

(p1)2 

1
96

p2(cid:19)

(3.5)

which is the dimensional reduction to 8 dimensions of the gravitational part of the green-

schwarz anomaly-cancelling term (here, rr is the ramond-ramond scalar of type iib

string theory).

5

the results above for the gravitational couplings on an op+-plane can be summarised

in the formula:

op+ :

2p5z xi

i  2s a(rt )

a(rn )

c rr

s l(rt /4)
l(rn /4)!

(3.6)

here, in addition to the tangent bundle contribution which we derived above, we have

conjectured the contribution of the normal bundle when this is nontrivial.

4. consistency with dualities

the above formulae for gravitational couplings can be checked with various dualities

in dierent dimensions. these checks are not strictly independent of the considerations

that gave rise to eq.(3.6), yet it is useful to carry them out explicitly to reassure oneself

that a sensible picture emerges in every dimension.

the rst check arises in 8 dimensions, where the vacuum with three o7 planes and
one o7+ plane was argued[7] to be dual to a special f-theory compactication with a

frozen d8 singularity. macroscopically, this is identical to a conventional d8 singularity

which can split into 10 generic singular bres. the 4-form gravitational couplings on a

7-brane or 7-plane are sl(2, z) invariant, hence we expect that the world-volume grav-

itational couplings of the frozen d8 singularity are equal to 10 times the worldvolume

couplings of a d7-brane. from eq.(3.2), with p = 7, we nd that the coecient of the
coupling is  5

24 , which is 10 times the coupling of a single d7-brane,  1

48 , as expected.

in 7 dimensions, the o6+ plane has similarly been related to m-theory with a frozen

d4 singularity[10]. for us, the key feature of this otherwise mysterious singularity is
that it is geometrically the same as an o6 plane with four d6-branes on top of it.
in this dimension, the gravitational coupling on an o6 plane and on a d6-brane was

re-derived from m-theory in ref.[5]. this derivation proceeds by starting with the well-

known one-loop gravitational coupling r c3  i8(r) in eleven-dimensional m-theory,

integrating this over the 4-dimensional manifold rep-

where i8(r) = 1

24(cid:0)p2  1

4 (p1)2(cid:1).

resenting the transverse space to a 6-brane or 6-plane, we get the induced gravitational

coupling on the coresponding object.

both for a 2-centre euclidean taub-nut space, which is the transverse space to a
d6-brane, and for the atiyah-hitchin space, transverse to an o6-plane, it is known that

6

r p1 = 2. thus, by the above arguments, for the space transverse to an o6+-plane we
must haver p1 = 10. this gives rise to the induced gravitational coupling



5

48 z c3  p1

o6+ :

(4.1)

which agrees with eq.(3.2) for p = 6.

in 5 dimensions, we can use the beautiful results of hori[11] relating various types of
o4-planes to m-theory orientifolds[12,13,14]. the o4 plane is relatively straightforward,

as it corresponds in m-theory to an orientifold 5-plane (which we will refer to as an om
5-plane). the o4+ plane is, according to ref.[11], an om-plane with a pair of m-theory

5-branes stuck to it. now, neither the m5-brane nor the om 5-plane carry gravitational

couplings[15]. however, being chiral objects, they carry an analogue of the sl(2, z) anom-

aly of ref.[16]. it was argued in ref.[15], by analogy with a similar mechanism discussed in

ref.[17], that after compactifying on a circle the chirality of these objects gives rise to the
appropriate gravitational couplings on the world-volumes of d4-branes and o4-planes.
it follows that the gravitational coupling on the o4+ plane is equal to that induced by

an om 5-plane and a pair of m 5-branes, which in turn is equal to the sum of gravita-
tional couplings on an o4-plane and a pair of d4-branes. this leads to the coupling
 5

192r arr  p1, in agreement with eq.(3.2) for p = 4.
the case of eo 4-planes, which give rise to so(2n + 1) gauge groups when branes

coincide with them, is rather dierent. according to ref.[11], these arise in m-theory by

combining the orientifolding operation in ve directions with a half-shift along the m-
direction x10. this action has no xed points, hence from the m-theory point of view
there is no orientifold plane at all. however, in the type iia limit (as the radius of the x10

direction goes to zero) the half-shift is not geometrically visible and we seem to have an

orientifold 4-plane. in fact the half-shift is now realized as half a unit of ramond-ramond

while it would be desirable to propose an m-theoretic origin for the gravitational

uxr arr along any curve that passes through the orientifold plane.
couplings on the eo 4-planes (analogous to chirality, discussed above for the o4 planes),

this does not seem to be straightforward, precisely because in the m-theory limit this 4-

plane is not an orientifold at all. however, it is interesting to note that this orientifold

4-plane is closely related to an uncharged orientifold 8-plane that has been discussed in

the literature[18]. consider the compactication of m-theory to 9 spacetime dimensions
on a klein bottle, dened as the quotient of a 2-torus labelled by x9, x10 by the action

7

x9  x9, x10  x10 + r10. from the m-theory point of view this has no xed points,
but in the string theory limit one nds two xed planes at x9 = 0, r9, with the half-shift
in x10 being realized as half a unit of arr-ux through each xed plane. these two planes

are neutral and the vacuum is therefore braneless. according to ref.[7], this model is
dual to another braneless orientifold, without rr ux, containing one o8 and one o8+

plane. hence the gravitational coupling on this exotic o 8-plane is the average of the
couplings on the o8 and o8+ planes, or:

neutral o8 :



1

4z c rr

5  p1

(4.2)

while the neutral 8-planes carry rr ux and are therefore dicult to study in perturbation
theory (like the orbifold planes in ref.[19]), the dual vacuum containing an o8 and an
o8+ plane can be described very precisely as a perturbation series[7].

one can analogously realize eo 4-planes in a braneless vacuum by compactifying m-

theory to 5 spacetime dimensions on a klein six-bottle, dened as the quotient of the
6-torus x5, . . . , x10 by the action (x5, . . . x9)  (x5, . . . x9), x10  x10 + r10. this

time, in the string theory limit there are 32 neutral orientifold planes, each carrying half

a unit of rr ux. according to ref.[11], this vacuum is dual to the string theory vacuum

discussed in ref.[14] where there are 32 eo4-planes, each consisting of half a d4-brane
stuck to an o4-plane. it follows that, like the neutral o8-planes, the neutral eo4-planes

carry gravitational couplings

in agreement with eq.(3.3).



eo4 :

1

64z arr  p1

(4.3)

we can also examine the exotic sp-type 4-plane (which we denoted o4+). this is

supposed to arise[11] as an m5-brane wrapped on the cylinder over which the eo4-plane is

smeared. in the string theory limit this brane will descend to half a d4-brane, hence the

coupling on this 4-plane is:

o4 :



5

192z arr  p1

(4.4)

which is the same as we found for the o4+-plane. thus it appears that both types of

sp-planes have the same gravitational coupling, as well as the same 4-brane charge.

finally we come to 4 spacetime dimensions, or orientifold 3-planes. here we nd

the pleasant result, from eqs.(3.2),(3.3) and (4.4) (in the last case we assume that the

8

o4-plane also doubles on compactication and t-duality) that three dierent types of

orientifold 3-planes have the same gravitational coupling:

(4.5)

o3+, eo3, o3 :



5

384z e  p1

consistent with the fact[20] that these three types of o3-planes are permuted into each

other by sl(2, z) s-duality.

5. intersecting orientifolds and branes

an interesting application of the above considerations can be found in a system where

an orientifold plane intersects a brane. here we will consider the case when an orientifold

3-plane intersects an ns 5-brane in type iib string theory. the worldvolume directions are

(x1, x2, x3) for the 3-plane and (x1, x2, x4, x5, x6) for the 5-brane, so they intersect over a

2-brane in the (x1, x2) directions. this is a supersymmetric conguration.

(0,1/2)

fig. (1): o3-plane with rr = 0 intersecting an ns5-brane.

as shown in ref.[20], an o3 plane intersecting an ns5-brane turns into an o3+

plane on the other side4. the latter is the standard sp-type plane that we have discussed

in previous sections. the particular property of o3-planes is that the space transverse to

them contains a 2-cycle (an rp 2) on which the uxes n s = r bn s and rr = r brr

2 . the eect of crossing an ns5-brane is that

can take two discrete values, 0 and 1

(rr, n s)  (rr, n s +

1

)

(5.1)

4 this phenomenon was rst discovered in ref.[21] for o4-planes.

9

where the -values are understood to be mod 1. hence in fig.1, the plane on the left is of
type (0, 0) and the one on the right is (0, 1

2 ).

we will now see that the world-volume gravitational couplings on the orientifold planes

jump across the ns5-brane. consider an rp 5 enclosing the o3 on the left. it contains

the rp 2 cycle on which we evaluate (rr, n s) to be (0, 0). now move this rp 5 towards
the right. it intersects the ns5-brane in an rp 2, enclosing the 2-brane intersection region

denoted in the gure by a point. recall that the 3-brane charge of the orientifold planes
jumps across the ns5-brane, from  1

4 . it is amusing to note that this is very much
like branes ending on branes[22], in that a net 3-brane charge is deposited on the 5-brane.

4 to + 1

this is usually interpreted as the fact that the intersection region acts like a magnetic

source in the 5-brane world-volume, carrying the net charge deposited on the 5-brane.

in the present case, this means that the (twisted) world-volume u (1) gauge eld

strength on the ns5-brane must be excited, with

zrp 2

f =

1
2

(5.2)

(in the covering space, the charges on the planes would be doubled and we would have

r f = 1). now let us consider the world-volume couplings on the ns5-brane:

in the presence of the world-volume ux through rp 2, these give rise to co-dimension 2

couplings:

48z e f  p1(r)

from the geometry of the problem, it follows that the world-volume couplings on the o3

plane on the left, added to the above terms, must equal the world-volume couplings of the

o3+ plane on the right. for the o3 plane, we have the couplings

adding this to eq.(5.4), we nd the result

this exhibits the fact that the o3+ plane has 3-brane charge + 1
gravitational 4-form coupling with coecient  5

384 as predicted in previous sections.

4 as expected, and also a

note that this jump in the world-volume coupling is not a simple consequence of

crossing the ns5-brane, as it only takes place when a world-volume ux is excited. for
a dierent example, consider the o3-plane of type ( 1

2 , 0), which is the so-odd orientifold
plane. when this intersects an ns5-brane, the plane on the right is the o3-plane of type
2 , 1
( 1

2 ), which is the exotic sp plane.

in this case, the orientifold planes on the left and right of the gure both have 3-brane

charge + 1

4 . hence, even though the value of n s jumps as before, there is no jump in
the 3-brane charge. it follows that no net charge is deposited on the ns5-brane, hence no

world-volume ux is excited. this in turn tells us that the gravitational coupling does not

jump in this case, in accordance with the results of the previous section.
