the superconformal ward identities combined with n = 2 harmonic analyticity are used to
evaluate two-loop four-point correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators in d = 4, n = 4
supersymmetric yang-mills theory in terms of the well-known one-loop box integral. the result
is conrmed by a direct numerical computation.

supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) theory with maximally extended (n = 4) supersymmetry
in four dimensions has long been known to have some very interesting properties, in particular,
it is ultra-violet nite and hence superconformally invariant quantum mechanically [1]. it also
admits monopole solutions which fall into spin one multiplets [2] and which play a crucial role
in montonen-olive duality [3, 4]. there has been a great deal of recent interest in this theory as
a superconformal eld theory stimulated by the maldacena conjecture via which it is related, in
a certain limit, to iib supergravity on ads5  s5 [5]. in a previous paper [6] we calculated four-
point functions of certain gauge-invariant operators in this theory at two loops in perturbation
theory using n = 2 harmonic superspace feynman diagrams [7]. the result involves three
functions, a1, a2 and a3 which can be expressed in terms of dierential operators acting on
a scalar two-loop integral 2. the rst two of these can be reduced quite straightforwardly to
the well-known one-loop box integral but the third is much more complicated and in [6] we
were unable to simplify it. as a consequence, we could not conrm the conformal invariance
of the two-loop contribution to the four-point function. furthermore, all three functions are
needed to construct the full n = 4 amplitude. in this note we show how this problem can be
solved by using the superconformal ward identities for harmonic-analytic operators in harmonic
superspace. more precisely, we show that from the ward identities combined with the dynamical
requirement of harmonic analyticity follow dierential constraints on the coecient functions.
thus, a3 is determined in terms of a1 and a2, so that it too reduces to a one-loop integral.
the relation between the two- and one-loop integrals we have found is far from obvious, so in
order to conrm it we have also performed a direct numerical computation.

in n = 2 harmonic superspace n = 4 yang-mills theory is formulated in terms of an n = 2
sym multiplet, described by a prepotential v ++, and a hypermultiplet, q+, both of which
take their values in the lie algebra of the gauge group su (nc). both of these superelds are
grassmann-analytic (g-analytic), that is they depend on half of the odd coordinates. we recall
that n = 2 harmonic superspace [8] is the product of minkowski superspace m with the sphere
s2  su (2)/u (1), and that the harmonic elds are dened on m  su (2) but are equivariant
with respect to the action of the u (1) isotropy group of the sphere. the coordinates of this
superspace are {x , 
together make up an su (2) matrix. a
supereld f q(x, , u) which has u (1) charge q is called grassmann analytic if it satises

i }, where the u

i ,  i, u+

i , u

 f q := u+

i di

f q = 0,

d+

 f q := u+

i

di

f q = 0.

(1)

these constraints are easily solved in an appropriate superspace frame and amount to functional
i only (but not on , ). thus, g-analyticity is just a
dependence on + := u+
kinematical constraint (similar to chirality in n = 1 superspace).

i i, + := u+

i

on shell, the hypermultiplet supereld q+ has the dynamical property of harmonic analyticity
(h-analyticity)

d++q+ = 0,

(2)

in addition to the kinematical property of grassmann analyticity. here d++, d = d++ and
do are the standard derivatives on su (2) (left-invariant vector elds) which fulll the algebraic
relations of the associated lie algebra. d++ essentially corresponds to  on the sphere in the
sense that a eld of positive charge q which is annihilated by d++ corresponds precisely to a
holomorphic section of the line bundle o(q) over s2; its dependence on the harmonic variables

2the coecient a2 was independently calculated using n = 1 superelds in [9].

2

is thereby restricted to be polynomial. in terms of component elds, the supereld equation (2)
eliminates the innite tower of auxiliary elds originating from the harmonic expansion on s2.
in addition, it puts the remaining physical elds on shell, therefore it is the eld equation of the
n = 2 hypermultiplet.

the operators we are interested in are the gauge-invariant bilinear combinations of the hyper-

multiplet, tr (q+q+), tr (eq+q+) and tr (eq+eq+), where tilde denotes a conjugation which combines

complex conjugation with the antipodal map on the sphere. these operators arise as compo-
nents of the n = 4 supercurrent multiplet of operators. precisely this multiplet corresponds
to d = 5, n = 8 supergravity on an ads background in the maldacena conjecture, when it
is decomposed into n = 2 superelds. in [6] we showed how it is possible to reconstruct the
leading scalar term of the n = 4 supercurrent four-point function from the leading terms of
three n = 2 hypermultiplet bilinear four-point functions. given this leading term, the entire
superfunction can be obtained by means of n = 4 superconformal symmetry.

the hypermultiplet bilinears satisfy both the g- and h-analyticity conditions on shell. provided,
therefore, that we are allowed to use the equations of motion of the underlying hypermultiplets,
n-point greens functions of such operators will be both g- and h-analytic functions on the
product of n copies of harmonic superspace. this circumstance, combined with the requirement
of superconformal invariance of the n = 4 theory, yields constraints on the greens functions
which can be understood as arising from the fact that analytic superconformal invariants have
poles on s2 while the greens functions themselves must be regular. it is precisely these con-
straints which will allow us to establish the relation among the three coecient functions of the
four-point amplitude.

we now summarise the results of reference [6] for the four-point function heq+eq+|q+q+|eq+eq+|q+q+i

(as explained in [6], the other possible combinations of hypermultiplet bilinears can either be
obtained from this one by permutations or vanish). its leading (scalar) term in an expansion in
the odd coordinates (denoted by |=0) is given by

heq+eq+|q+q+|eq+eq+|q+q+i |=0

(and similarly for g1, g2 and g3) are two- and one-loop scalar integrals, correspondingly. as
usual xij := xi  xj. the dependence of the greens functions on the harmonic variables is
polynomial (a corollary of h-analyticity) and is given by factors such as (14)2(23)2 where the

yet known in explicit form. however, this is no impediment to the calculation of a1 and a2
since the combination of derivatives on f appearing here can be straightforwardly reduced to a
one-loop box integral by using translation invariance for one of the subintegrations. doing this

a2 diers from a1 only by the interchange 2  4. in contrast to the evaluation of a1 and a2
the evaluation of a3 is a formidable problem; the only explicit information on a3 obtained in
[6] was the cancellation of the leading 1

- pole in a3 in the limit x14  0.

in the following we shall use conformal supersymmetry and harmonic analyticity to obtain a
constraint equation between the three coecient functions a1, a2, a3. by conformal invariance
we can rewrite these in terms of conformal cross ratios as follows:

the entire g-analytic supereld four-point function can then be constructed systematically as
a power series in + and + using the superconformal ward identities [12].
in addition, the
dynamical requirement of h-analyticity at the + + level leads to the following dierential
constraints on the coecient functions a, b, c: 3

s = ts  tt ,
t = ss + (s  1)t

one sees that only two of the three coecients are restricted. the set of rst-order partial
dierential equations (15) is equivalent to a single second-order equation (the compatibility
condition for the system (15)), e.g., for :

sss + ttt + (s + t  1)st + 2(s + t) = 0 .

(17)

given some boundary conditions the above equations allow one to completely x  and , thus
leaving arbitrary only the coecient a.

in this note we shall concentrate on applying this general relation at the two-loop level. here we
have some additional information which simplies the partial dierential equations (15). from
the explicit graph calculation we already know that (see (12),(13))

3the result we quote here follows from the general properties of the correlation functions and should be valid

to all orders in perturbation theory, as will be shown in detail elsewhere [12].

this equation is non-trivial, and we have not been able to show that it is satised analytically,
since f itself is not known in suciently explicit form. instead, we have used mathematica
to evaluate both sides of the equation numerically, and have veried that they agree for more
than twenty choices of the parameters x2
ij (with three-digit precision). for the evaluation of f
we used a two-parameter integral representation [13] which relates the integral (6) to the sunset
diagram with one massless line [14, 15, 16, 17]. on the right hand side the explicit formula (10)
was employed.

retrospectively, the knowledge that all three coecient functions in (3) are related to each other,
so that it is sucient to determine one of them, can be used to drastically simplify the graph
calculation carried out in [6]. suppose that we wish to compute only the coecient a2. to this
end we can identify two pairs of harmonic variables as follows,

so that only the structure (12)2(34)2  (12)4 survives. then among all the two-loop graphs
considered in [6] only the following one is non-vanishing:

ones according to the identity r d4+(d+)4 =r d8. at the vertices 5 and 6 this can be done

with the help of the spinor derivatives (d+

6  2. the remaining spinor derivatives (d+

the sym line or the other two matter lines 5  4 and 3  6. however, owing to the identication
(23), the propagator 5  4 has the same g-analyticity as 1  5, and similarly for 3  6 and 6  2.
thus, all the spinor derivatives from 1  5 and 6  2 go onto the sym line and we get twelve
spinor derivatives on 8(5  6). next, since the propagators 1  5 and 6  2 are now spinor
derivative-free, the  points 5 and 6 are identied with the external ones 1 and 2. finally, we
are only interested in the leading (scalar) term of the amplitude, so we can set 1,2,3,4 = 0. this
results in a dalembertian on the internal line 5  6, which explains why the two-loop integral
collapses to the one-loop integral (1).

to summarise, we have shown that, by combining the results of [6] with the constraints implied
by superconformal invariance and h-analyticity, we are able to express the coecient function
a3, which seemed to involve a true two-loop integration, and had so far deed all eorts
at analytic evaluation, in terms of the functions a1, a2 which are easily expressed in terms of
a single one-loop integral. this relation between a1, a2 and a3 implies a non-trivial partial
dierential equation for the two-loop integral f which we have conrmed numerically. we have
also demonstrated that, once it is known that the calculation of the complete amplitude can be
reduced to the calculation of either a1 or a2, this knowledge can be used to drastically simplify
the feynman diagram calculation.

we should mention that neither the two-loop calculation performed in [6] nor the analysis of the
ward identities presented here make any use of the full n = 4 supersymmetry. in addition to
n = 2 supersymmetry, they rely only on niteness (conformal invariance) which is known to be
a property of a larger class of supersymmetric theories. at present we cannot say what specic
role n = 4 supersymmetry might play at higher orders of perturbation theory.

it should be emphasized that our nal result is much simpler than one would a priori expect.
generically, a four-point two-loop integral such as the one encountered here is expected to
contain, in addition to logarithms and dilogarithms of the kinematic variables, also tri- and
quadrilogarithms. and indeed, the elusive function f itself contains polylogarithms up to fourth
order, as can be seen from the limiting case x23 = 0, for which f was obtained in closed form in
[18]. it is tempting to speculate that the absence of tri- and quadrilogarithms in the two-loop
result is just a glimpse of a universality property which would extend to all orders in perturbation
theory for this amplitude, at least for large nc. this seems even more plausible in view of the
recent result that the same one-loop box function (1) appears also in the instanton contribution
to four-point correlators in n = 4 sym theory [19]. the same simple dilogarithmic behaviour is
found also for the spacetime dependence of the axion/dilaton amplitudes corresponding to the
n = 4 four-point function according to the maldacena conjecture [20, 21, 22, 23].
