1. introduction

a gauge chern-simons theory is interesting both for its mathemati-
cal novelty and for its applications for certain planar condensed matter
phenomena (such as the fractional quantum hall eect) and for non-
abelian gauge models in eld theory. for example, the supersymmetric
index can be computed in n = 1 super yang-mills theory in three
spacetime dimensions with a chern-simons interaction at level k by
making a relation to a chern-simons theory [1].

recently the chern-simons functional has been actively studied in
low dimensional topology in connection with floer homology [2], where
it was used as a morse function. this functional has also been used in
topological eld theory, where the new topological invariants of oriented
3-manifolds and links in it were specied [3]. the topology of manifolds
can be studied with the help of the path integral approach in quantum
eld theory, which suggests the asymptotic behaviour of invariants in-
cluding the chern-simons invariant, eta invariant, redemeister torsion,
and so on [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. under such circumstances it is
important to have an explicit formula for the chern-simons invariant.
the chern-simons invariants for the case of su(2) and for some
classes of 3-manifolds (including the seifert bered 3-manifolds) have
been listed in [13, 14, 15] by cutting a 3-manifold into pieces for which

the invariants can be computed. the formula for the chern-simons
invariants of irreducible su(n)at connection on the seifert bered
3-manifolds has been derived in [16]. in this paper we shall compute
this invariant using the index theorem for a manifold with a closed
hyperbolic boundary x = \h3.

2. the chern-simons invariant

in this section we briey summarize the formalism that we shall use
in this paper. our goal is to present a formula for the u(n)- chern-
simons invariant of an irreducible at connection on a closed hyperbolic
3-manifold. this invariant is dened by the chern-simons functional
cs which can be considered as a function on a space of connections on
a trivial principal bundle over a compact oriented 3-manifold x given
by

cs(a) =

tr(cid:18)a  da +

a  a  a(cid:19) .

(2.1)

let x be a locally symmetric riemannian manifold with negative sec-

metric space of rank one. the group of orientation preserving isome-

tional curvature. its universal covering ex  x is a riemannian sym-
tries eg of ex is a connected semisimple lie group of real rank one and
ex = eg/ek, where ek is a maximal compact subgroup of eg. the fun-
damental group of x acts by covering transformations on ex and gives
rise to a discrete, co-compact subgroup   eg such that x = \eg/ek.
if g is a linear connected nite covering of eg, the embedding   eg
let a  p be a one-dimensional subspace and let j = kt ga be the

lifts to an embedding   g. let k  g be a maximal compact
subgroup of g, then x = \g/k is a compact manifold.

let g = k  p be a cartan decomposition of the lie algebra g of g.

centralizer of a in k. fixing a positive root system of (g, a) we have an
iwasawa decomposition g = k  a  n. for g = so(m, 1) (m  z+),
k = so(m), and j = so(m  1). the corresponding symmetric
space of non-compact type is the real hyperbolic space hm of sectional
curvature 1. its compact dual space is the unit m sphere.

let p = x  g be a trivial principal bundle over x with the
gauge group g = u(n) and let ax = 1(x, g) be the space of all
connections on p; this space is an ane space of 1-forms on x with
values in the lie algebra g of g. the value of the function cs(a)
on the space of connections ax, a  ax, at a critical point can be
regarded as a topological invariant of a pair (x, ), where  is an
orthogonal representation of the fundamental group 1(x)  .

chern-simons invariants of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds 3

let ax,f = {a  ax|fa = da + a  a = 0} be the space of at
connections on p. an important formula related to the integrand in
(2.1) is

dtr(cid:18)a  da +

a  a  a(cid:19) = tr (fa  fa) .

(2.2)

eq.

(2.2) gives another approach to the chern-simons invariant.
indeed, let m be an oriented 4-manifold with boundary m = x.
one can extend p to a trivial g bundle over m; then stokes theorem
gives

cs(a) =

1

82zm

tr(cid:0)fea  fea(cid:1) ,

(2.3)

where ea is any extension of a over m. eq. (2.3) can be viewed as a

generalization of the chern-simons invariant to the case in which p is
a non-trivial u(n) bundle over x [16]. in fact we shall show that
the chern-simons functional is well-dened modulo(z/2) in the case
of a u(n) connection.

3. invariants of closed hyperbolic manifolds

let e = ex  cn be a at vector bundle, and let ep be a principal

u(n) bundle over x which is an extension of p. any 1-dimensional
representation  of  factors through a representation of h 1(x, z).
it can be shown that for a unitary representation  :   u(n),
=
the corresponding at vector bundle e is topologically trivial (e
x  cn) i det |tor1 : tor1  u(1) is the trivial representation.
here tor1 is the torsion part of h 1(x, z) and det  is a 1-dimensional
representation of  dened by det () := det (()), for   .

for any representation  :   u(n) one can construct a vector

\h3 which is an extension of a at vector bundle e over \h3. let

bundle ee over a certain 4-manifold m with boundary m = x =
ea be any extension of a at connection a corresponding to . the
dea

index theorem of atiyah-patodi-singer for the twisted dirac operator

[17, 18, 19] is given by

where h(0, o) is the dimension of the space of harmonic spinors on
x (h(0, o) = dimker o = multiplicity of the 0-eigenvalue of o
acting on x); o is a dirac operator on x acting on spinors with
coecients in  (for details see appendices a and b).

4

a.a. bytsenko, a.e. gonc alves, and f.l. williams

the chern-simons invariants of \h3 can be derived from eq. (3.1)

as follows. for a closed manifold m we have

82 tr(cid:16)fea

 fea(cid:17) = ch2(ee),

where ch2(ee) is the second chern character of ee, which is expressed

in terms of the rst and second chern classes:

ch2(ee) =

c1(ee)2  c2(ee).
the chern character and the ba genus are given by
ch(ee) = rankee + c1(ee) + ch2(ee)
= dim  + c1(ee) + ch2(ee),
ba(m) = 1 

thus we have

p1(m).

ch(ee)ba(m) =(cid:16)dim  + c1(ee) + ch2(ee)(cid:17)(cid:18)1

we are now able to use the formulae (c.3) and (c.6) of appendix c
for the eta invariant in eq. (3.11). it follows that

4. concluding remarks

for an irreducible u(n) representation formula (3.13) gives the
values of the chern-simons invariants. this is the main result of the
paper. the formula for the chern-simons functional involves a selberg
type zeta function z(0, o) associated with twisted eta invariants of
atiyah-patodi-singer [17, 20, 21]. in the case of a u(n) connection
this is a well-dened functional, modulo(z/2). note also that the ex-
plicit results (3.12) and (3.13) can be very important for the study of
the relation between quantum invariant for an oriented 3-manifold, de-
ned with the help of a representation theory of quantum group [22],
and wittens invariant [3], related to the path integral approach. we
hope to return to this study elsewhere.

5. appendix a. dirac operators and the eta invariant

we recall in this section some standard material on dirac bundles
(for details see, for example, ref. [23]). let m be an even-dimensional
orientable riemannian manifold with boundary m  y and let e 
m be a hermitian vector bundle equipped with a compatible connection
. let c(m) denote the complexied cliord bundle. we suppose
that there is a bundle map from c(m)  end e which is an algebra
homomorphism on each ber and which covers the identity:

is commutative. denote by s the spin bundles associated to the two
half-spin representation of spin(dimm); then s = s+s where s are
half-spin bundles.  induces a connection on s e which is compatible
with both the metric and the z2 grading. the latter connection
canonically denes a dirac operator d : c (s+  e)  c (s  e)
described by

d : c (s+

e ) denotes the cliord multiplication

suppose the metric on a neighborhood u  [0, 1)y of the boundary
is a product metric. then near the boundary y one has a separation

x + o(cid:1), where

of variables which leads to the representation d = (cid:0) 

the decomposition  = dx  1(x) + 2(x) of a smooth form  is used.
thus d acts on c  ((0, 1), p(y )  p(y )), p(y ) being the space of
smooth p forms on y . a little computation shows that o is an elliptic
self-adjoint map on p(y ) dened by o = (1)k+p+1(  d d) [17],
where the symbol  denotes the duality operator on y , k = (dim y )/4
and  is either a 2p form ( = 1) or a (2p  1) form ( = 1).
the operator o maps even (odd) forms to even (odd) forms and can
therefore be decomposed as follows: o = oev  oodd, where oev is
isomorphic to oodd [17].

recall some standard material on the eta invariant of a self-adjoint
elliptic dierential operator acting on a compact manifold y . for de-
tails we refer the reader to refs. [17, 18, 19] where the eta invariant was
introduced in connection with the index theorem for a manifold with
boundary. to dene a spectral invariant which measures the asymme-
try of the spectrum spec(o) of an operator o, one starts with next
proposition.

proposition a.1. the holomorphic function

chern-simons invariants of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds 7

(s, o)

def

= xspeco\{0}

sgn()||s = tr(cid:16)o(cid:0)o2(cid:1)(s+1)/2(cid:17) ,

(a.3)

is well dened for all s  0 and extends to a meromorphic function
on c.

indeed, from the asymptotic behaviour of the heat operator at t = 0,

tr (o exp (to2)) = o(t1/2) [24] and from the identity

(s, o) =

1

2 (cid:1)zr+
(cid:0) s+1

tr(cid:16)oeto2(cid:17) t(s1)/2dt,

(a.4)

it follows that (s, o) admits a meromorphic extension to the whole s
plane, with at most simple poles at s = (dim y  k)/(ord o) (k  z+)
and locally computable residues.

it has been established that point s = 0 is not a pole, which makes
it possible to dene the eta invariant of o by (0, o). it also follows
directly that (0, o) = (0, o) and (0, o) = (0, o),  > 0.
one can attach the eta invariant to any operator of dirac type on a
compact riemannian manifold of odd dimension. dirac operators on
even dimensional manifolds have symmetric spectrums and, therefore,
trivial eta invariants. because oev is isomorphic to oodd, we have

(s, oev) = (s, oodd) =

1
2

(s, o).

(a.5)

6. appendix b. closed geodesics on negative curvature

manifold and selberg type zeta function

let y be a compact oriented (4m  1) dimensional riemannian
manifold of constant negative curvature. a remarkable formula relating
(s, b), b  oev, to the closed geodesics on y has been derived by
millson [20]. more explicitly, millson proved the following result for a
selberg type (shintani) zeta function.

theorem b.1 (millson [20]). dene a zeta function by the following
series which is absolutely convergent for  s > 0

where [] runs over the nontrivial conjugacy classes in  = 1(y ), ()
is the length of the closed geodesic c (with multiplicity m()) in the
free homotopy class corresponding to [], ph() is the restriction of the
linear poincare map p () = d1 at (c, c)  t y to the directions

normal to the geodesic ow t and  
 is parallel translation around c
on 
 = i eigenspace of b( c) (b denoting the principal symbol
of b). then z(s, b) admits a meromorphic continuation to the entire
complex plane, which in particular is holomorphic at 0. moreover

logz(0, b) = i(0, b).

(b.2)

in fact z(s, b) satises the functional equation

z(s, b)z(s, b) = e2i(0,b).

(b.3)

7. appendix c. twisted eta invariants associated to

locally symmetric spaces

milsons formulae have been extended by moscovici and stanton
[21] to dirac type operators (acting in non-positively curved locally
symmetric manifolds), even with additional coecients in locally at
bundles. we now present the main results obtained in [21].

let ey denote be a simply connected cover of y which is a sym-
metric space of noncompact type, and let ee denote the pull-back to
ey for any vector bundle e over y . bundles which will be consid-

ered satisfy a local homogeneity condition. namely, a vector bundle
e over y is g locally homogeneous, for some lie group g, if there
is a smooth action of g on e which is linear on the bers and cov-

ers the action of g on ey . standard constructions from linear algebra

applied to any g locally homogeneous e give in natural way corre-
sponding g locally homogeneous vector bundles.
in particular, all
bundles t y, c(y ), end e  e  e are g locally homogeneous [21].
we shall require also that all constructions associated with g locally
homogeneous bundles to be g equivariant. for example, for each g
in g the commutative diagram is

c(ey )  endee
yg
gy
c(ey )  endee

(c.1)

let o denote a generalized dirac operator associated to a locally ho-

mogeneous bundle e over y . we shall require g equivariance for e
the lift of  to ee and therefore the corresponding dirac operator is

then g invariant.

chern-simons invariants of closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds 9

the main results can be stated as follows.

theorem c.1 (moscovici and stanton [21]). the following function
can be dened, initially for (s2)  0, by the formula

logz(s, o)

def

= x[]e1()

(1)q

l(, o)

|det(i  ph())|1/2

es()
m()

,

(c.2)

where e1() is the set of those conjugacy classes [] for which y has

the property that the euclidean de rham factor of ey is 1-dimensional,

the number q is one-half the dimension of the ber of the center bundle
c(t y ) over y, and l(, o) is the lefschetz number (see ref. [25]).
furthermore logz(s, o) has a meromorphic continuation to c given by
the identity

logz(s, o) = logdet

(cid:18)o  is
o + is(cid:19) + i(s, o),

(c.3)

where s  ispec
tional equation



(o)

(spec(o)  {0}), and z(s, o) satises the func-

z(s, o)z(s, o) = e2i(s,o).

(c.4)

suppose now  :   u(f ) be a unitary representation of  on f .

the hermitian vector bundle f = ey  f over y inherits a at con-
nection from the trivial connection on ey  f . we specialize to the case

of locally homogeneous dirac operators o : c (y, e)  c (y, e) in
order to construct a generalized operator o, acting on spinors with
coecients in . if o : c (y, v )  c (y, v ) is a dierential operator
acting on the sections of the vector bundle v , then o extends canon-
ically to a dierential operator o : c (y, v  f)  c (y, v  f),
uniquely characterized by the property that o is locally isomorphic
to o  ...  o (dim f times) [21].

one can repeat the arguments of the previous sections to construct

a twisted zeta function z(s, o).

theorem c.2 (moscovici and stanton [21]). there exists a zeta func-
tion z(s, o), meromorphic on c, given for (s2)  0 by the formula

logz(s, o)

def

= x[]e1()

(1)qtr()

l(, o)

|det(i  ph())|1/2

(c.5)

moreover one has

logz(0, o) = i(0, o).
