abstract

we rewrite the standard 4-dimensional dirac equation in terms of quaternionic
2-component spinors, leading to a formalism which treats both massive and massless
particles on an equal footing. the resulting unied description has the correct particle
spectrum to be a generation of leptons, with the correct number of spin/helicity states.
furthermore, precisely three such generations naturally combine into an octonionic
description of the 10-dimensional massless dirac equation, as previously discussed in [1].

1 introduction

we recently outlined a new dimensional reduction scheme [1]. we show here in detail that
applying this mechanism to the 10-dimensional massless dirac equation on majorana-weyl
spinors leads to a quaternionic description of the full 4-dimensional (free) dirac equation
which treats both massive and massless particles on an equal footing. furthermore, there
are naturally 3 such descriptions, each of which corresponds to a generation of leptons with
the correct number of spin/helicity states.

the massive dirac equation is usually formulated in the context of 4-component dirac
spinors. the 4 degrees of freedom correspond to the choice of spin (up or down) and the
choice of particle or antiparticle. similarly, 2-component penrose spinors, which can be
thought of as the square roots of null vectors, correspond to massless objects, such as photons.
in section 2 we set the stage by reviewing these standard properties of the chiral description
of the momentum-space dirac equation.

much of this material was presented in an invited talk entitled choosing a preferred complex subal-
gebra of the octonions given at the 5th international conference on cliord algebras and their
applications in mathematical physics in ixtapa, mexico, in june 1999.

1

penrose spinors are usually thought of as weyl projections of dirac spinors; a dirac spinor
contains twice the information of a single penrose spinor. as an alternative to doubling the
number of (complex) components, however, we double the dimension of the underlying divi-
sion algebra, from the complex numbers c to the quaternions h. the anticommutativity of
the quaternions then enables us to package two complex representations of opposite chirality
into the (now quaternionic) 2-component formalism. in section 3 we show how to replace
the usual 4-component complex dirac description with an equivalent 2-component quater-
nionic penrose description, and further discuss how this puts the massive and massless dirac
equations on an equal footing.

we then consider in section 4 the massless dirac equation on majorana-weyl spinors (in
momentum space) in 10 dimensions, which can be nicely described in terms of 2-component
spinors over the octonions o, the only other normed division algebra besides r, c, and h.
solutions of this equation are automatically quaternionic, and thus lend themselves to the
preceding quaternionic description.

the nal, and most important, ingredient in our approach is the the dimensional re-
duction scheme introduced in [1]. in sections 5.1 and 5.2 we describe how the choice of a
preferred octonionic unit, or equivalently of a preferred complex subalgebra c  o, naturally
reduces 10 spacetime dimensions to 4, and further allows us to use the standard represen-
tation of the lorentz group so(3, 1) as sl(2, c)  sl(2, o). putting this all together,
we show in section 5.3 that the quaternionic spin/helicity eigenstates correspond precisely
to the particle spectrum of a generation of leptons, consisting of 1 massive and 1 massless
particle and their antiparticles.

in section 5.4, we discuss the remarkable fact that the quaternionic spin eigenstates are
in fact simultaneous eigenstates of all 3 spin operators, although the other two eigenvalues
are not real. finally, in section 6 we discuss our results, in particular that, in a natural sense,
there are precisely 3 such quaternionic subalgebras of the octonions, which we interpret as
generations.

there is a long history of trying to use the quaternions in 4-dimensional quantum me-
chanics; see the comprehensive treatment in [2] and references therein. our approach is
dierent in that we use the additional degrees of freedom to repackage existing information,
rather than increasing the size of the underlying space of scalars. ultimately, this leads us
to work in more than 4 spacetime dimensions.

we also note a relatively unknown paper by dirac [3] which, much to our surprise,

contains the precursors of several of the key ideas presented here.

the octonions were rst introduced into quantum mechanics by jordan [4, 5]. there has
in fact been much recent interest in using the octonions in (higher-dimensional) eld theory;
excellent modern treatments can be found in [6, 7, 8].

after much of this work was completed, we became aware of the recent work of schucking
et al. [9, 10], who also use a quaternionic formalism to describe a single generation of leptons.
they further speculate that extending the formalism to the octonions would yield a descrip-
tion of a single generation of quarks as well. although the language is strikingly similar, our
approach diers fundamentally from theirs in its description of momentum. ultimately, this
hinges on our interpretation of the obvious su(2) as spin, whereas schucking and coworkers
interpret it as isospin.

the original formulation of the dirac equation involves the even part of the cliord
algebra, historically written in terms of the matrices a = ta and  = t. explicitly, the
momentum-space dirac equation in this signature can be written as

(t p  m t)  = 0

(3)

where  = t, x, y, z and  is a 4-component complex (dirac) spinor.

writing  in terms of two 2-component complex weyl (or penrose) spinors  and  as

and expanding (3) leads to

where we have set t = i, which reduces (5) to the two equations

which reverses the sign of pt, so that ep can be identied with the 1-form dual to p. this

interpretation is strengthened by noting that

where the identication of the norm of p with m is just the compatibility condition between
(7) and (8).

1for later compatibility with our octonion conventions we use  rather than i to denote the complex unit.

3 quaternionic formalism

the quaternions h are the associative, noncommutative, normed division algebra over the
reals. the quaternions are spanned by the identity element 1 and three imaginary units,
usually denoted i, j, k := ij. quaternionic conjugation, denoted with a bar, is given by
reversing the sign of each imaginary unit. each imaginary unit squares to 1, and they
anticommute with each other; the full multiplication table then follows using associativity.2
however, in order to avoid conict with our subsequent conventions for the octonions, we will
instead label our quaternionic basis , k, k. the imaginary unit  will play the role of the
complex unit i, and, as we will see later, k will label this particular quaternionic subalgebra
of the octonions. in terms of the cayley-dickson process [12, 13], we have

h = c + ck = (r + r) + (r + r)k

(11)

as vector spaces, h = c2, which allows us to identify h2 with c4 in several dierent

ways. we choose the identication

with a, b, c, d  c. equivalently, we can write this identication in terms of the weyl
(penrose) spinors  and  as

a
b
c

since (13) is clearly a vector space isomorphism, there is also an isomorphism relat-
ing the linear maps on these spaces. we can use the induced isomorphism to rewrite the
dirac equation (3) in 2-component quaternionic language. direct computation yields the
correspondences

ta =(cid:18) a

2the use of ~, ~, ~k for cartesian basis vectors originates with the quaternions, which were introduced
by hamilton as an early step towards vectors [11]. making the obvious identication of vectors ~v, ~w with
imaginary quaternions v, w, then the real part of the quaternionic product vw is (minus) the dot product
~v  ~w, while the imaginary part is the cross product ~v  ~w.

since the left-hand-side is the 4  4 identity matrix and the right-hand-side is the 2  2
identity matrix. direct translation of (3) now leads to the quaternionic dirac equation

(p  mk)( + k) = 0

(18)

working backwards, we can separate this into an equation not involving k, which is precisely
(8), and an equation involving k, which is

multiplying this equation on the left by k, and using the remarkable identity

p k  mk = 0

reduces (19) to (7), as expected.

k p k = ep

(19)

(20)

so far, we have done nothing more or less than rewrite the usual momentum-space dirac
equation in 2-component quaternionic language. however, the appearance of the term mk
suggests a way to put in the mass term on the same footing as the other terms, which we
now exploit. multiplying (18) on the left by k and using (20) brings the dirac equation
to the form

where we have introduced the 2-component quaternionic spinor

(ep + mk)  = 0

 = k( + k) =  + k

when written out in full, (21) takes the form

(cid:18) pt + pz

px + py + km

px  py  km

pt  pz (cid:19)  = 0

(21)

(22)

(23)

this clearly suggests viewing the mass as an additional spacelike component of a higher-
dimensional vector. furthermore, since the matrix multiplying  has determinant zero,
this higher-dimensional vector is null. we thus appear to have reduced the massive dirac
equation in 4 dimensions to the massless dirac, or weyl, equation in higher dimensions,
thus putting the massive and massless cases on an equal footing. this expectation is indeed
correct, as we show in the next section in the more general octonionic setting.

4 octonionic formalism

4.1 octonionic penrose spinors

the octonions o are the nonassociative, noncommutative, normed division algebra over the
reals. the octonions are spanned by the identity element 1 and seven imaginary units, which
we label as {i, j, k, k, j, i, }. each imaginary unit squares to 1

i2 = j 2 = k2 = ... = 2 = 1

(24)

tive plane. each of the 7 oriented lines gives a quaternionic triple.

and the full multiplication table can be conveniently encoded in the 7-point projective plane,
as shown in figure 1; each line is to be thought of as a circle. the octonionic units can be
grouped into (the imaginary parts of) quaternionic subalgebras in 7 dierent ways, corre-
sponding to the 7 lines in the gure; these will be referred to as quaternionic triples. within
each triple, the arrows give the orientation, so that e.g.

ij = k = ji

(25)

any three imaginary basis units which do not lie in a such a triple anti-associate. note that
any two octonions automatically lie in (at least one) quaternionic triple, so that expressions
containing only two independent imaginary octonionic directions do associate. octonionic
conjugation is given by reversing the sign of the imaginary basis units, and the norm is just

3a number of authors, such as [16], have used this approach to describe supersymmetric theories in 10
dimensions. fairlie & manogue [17, 18] and manogue & sudbery [19] described solutions of the superstring
equations of motion using octonionic parameters, and schray [20, 21] described the superparticle. a more
extensive bibliography appears in [20].

where q = q0  q9  r are the components of q in 2 null directions and q = q1 + q2i +
... + q8  o is an octonion representing the transverse spatial coordinates. following [19],
we dene

furthermore, since q satises its characteristic polynomial, we have

eq = q  tr (q)i

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

 qeq = eqq = q2 + tr (q)q = det(q)i = gqqi

where g is the minkowski metric (with signature (+  ... )). we can therefore identify

the tilde operation with the metric dual, so that eq represents the covariant vector eld q.

just as in the complex case (compare (1)), this can be thought of (up to associativity
issues) as a weyl representation of the underlying cliord algebra cl (9, 1) in terms of 4  4
gamma matrices of the form

which are now octonionic. it is readily checked that

eq 0(cid:19)
q =(cid:18) 0 q

as desired.

in this language, a majorana spinor  = (cid:18) 
whose chiral projections are the majorana-weyl spinors (cid:18) 

(cid:19) is a 4-component octonionic column,
(cid:19), which can be

0(cid:19) and (cid:18) 0

identied with the 2-component octonionic columns  and , which in turn can be thought
of as generalized penrose spinors. writing

which is the octonionic weyl equation. in matrix notation, it is straightforward to show that
the momentum p of a solution of the weyl equation must be null: (42) says that the 2  2
hermitian matrix p has 0 as one of its eigenvalues, 5 which forces det(p ) = 0, which is

which in turn is precisely the condition that p be null.

ep p = 0

(43)

equations (43) and (42) are algebraically the same as the octonionic versions of two of
the superstring equations of motion, as discussed in [17, 18, 19], and are also the octonionic
superparticle equations [20]. as implied by those references, (43) implies the existence of a
2-component spinor  such that

p = 

(44)

where the sign corresponds to the time orientation of p , and the general solution of (42) is

 = 

(45)

4we assume here that the components of our spinors are commuting, as we believe that the anticommuting
nature of fermions may be carried by the octonionic units themselves. an analogous result for anticommuting
spinors was obtained in both of [18, 20].

5it is not true in general [22, 23] that the determinant of an n  n hermitian octonionic matrix is the

product of its (real) eigenvalues, unless n = 2; however, see also [24].

(42)

where   o is arbitrary. the components of  lie in the complex subalgebra of o determined
by p , so that (the components of)  and  (and hence also p ) belong to a quaternionic
subalgebra of o. thus, for solutions (45), the weyl equation (41) itself becomes quaternionic.

furthermore, it follows immediately from (45) that

 = ||2p

(46)

comparing this with (40), we see that the vector constructed from  is proportional to p ,
or in more traditional language

  p

(47)

which can be interpreted as the requirement that the pauli-lubanski spin vector be propor-
tional to the momentum for a massless particle.

5 dimensional reduction and spin

5.1 choosing a preferred complex subalgebra

the description in the preceding section of 10-dimensional minkowski space in terms of
hermitian octonionic matrices is a direct generalization of the usual description of ordinary
(4-dimensional) minkowski space in terms of complex hermitian matrices. if we x a complex
subalgebra c  o, then we single out a 4-dimensional minkowski subspace of 10-dimensional
minkowski space. the projection of a 10-dimensional null vector onto this subspace is a
causal 4-dimensional vector, which is null if and only if the original vector was already
contained in the subspace, and timelike otherwise. the time orientation of the projected
vector is the same as that of the original, and the induced mass is given by the norm of
the remaining 6 components. furthermore, the ordinary lorentz group so(3, 1) clearly
sits inside the lorentz group so(9, 1) via the identication of their double-covers, the spin
groups spin(d, 1), namely 6

spin(3, 1) = sl(2, c)  sl(2, o) = spin(9, 1)

(48)

therefore, all it takes to break 10 spacetime dimensions to 4 is to choose a preferred
octonionic unit to play the role of the complex unit. we choose  rather than i to ll this
role, preferring to save i, j, k for a (distinguished) quaternionic triple. the projection 
from o to c is given by

(q) =

(q + q)

(49)

1
2

and we thus obtain a preferred sl(2, c) subgroup of sl(2, o), corresponding to the phys-
ical lorentz group.

6the last equality is more usually discussed at the lie algebra level. manogue & schray [25] gave an
explicit representation using this language of the nite lorentz transformations in 10 spacetime dimensions.
for further discussion of the notation sl(2, o), see also [26].

9

5.2 spin

since we now have a preferred 4-d lorentz group, we can use its rotation subgroup su(2) 
sl(2, c) to dene spin. however, care must be taken when constructing the lie algebra
su(2), due to the lack of commutativity.

under the usual action of m  su(2) on a hermitian matrix q (thought of as a spacetime

vector via (34)), namely

q 7 mqm 

we can identify the basis rotations as usual as

corresponding to rotations by the angle  about the z, y, and x axes, respectively.

the innitesimal generators of the lie algebra su(2) are obtained by dierentiating these

group elements, via

where as before a = x, y, z. for reasons which will become apparent, we have not multiplied
these generators by  to obtain hermitian matrices. we have instead

spin eigenstates are usually obtained as eigenvectors of the hermitian matrix lz, with

we therefore consider the eigenvalue problem

blz =

with   r. it is straightforward to show that the real eigenvalues are

 =

2

as expected. however, the form of the eigenvectors is a bit more surprising:

+ =(cid:18) a
kd(cid:19)

 =(cid:18) kb
c (cid:19)

(60)

(61)

where a, b, c, d  c are any elements of the preferred complex subalgebra, and k is any
imaginary octonionic unit orthogonal to , so that k and  anticommute. thus, the com-
ponents of spin eigenstates are contained in the quaternionic subalgebra h  o which is
generated by  and k.

therefore, if we wish to consider spin eigenstates,  must be in the quaternionic subalgebra
h dened by the solution. we can further assume without loss of generality that h takes
the form given in (11). thus, the only possible nonzero components of p are pt = p0,
px = p1, pk = p4, pk = p5, py = p8, and pz = p9, corresponding to the gamma matrices with
components in h. we can further assume (via a rotation in the (k, k)-plane if necessary)
that p5 = 0, so that

p = (p ) + m k

(p ) = p  p

with  = 0, 1, 8, 9 (or equivalently  = t, x, y, z) is complex, and corresponds to the 4-
dimensional momentum of the particle, with squared mass

m2 = pp =  det((p ))

(64)

inserting (62) into (42), we recover precisely (21), and we see that we have come full circle:
solutions of the octonionic weyl equation (41) are described precisely by the quaternionic
formalism of section 3, and the dimensional reduction scheme determines the mass term.

5.3 particles

for each solution  of (45), the momentum is proportional to  by (46). up to an overall
factor, we can therefore read o the components of the 4-dimensional momentum p directly
from (). we can use a lorentz transformation to bring a massive particle to rest, or to
orient the momentum of a massless particle to be in the z-direction.

if m 6= 0, we can distinguish particles from antiparticles by the sign of the term involv-
ing m, which is the coecient of k in p . equivalently, we have the particle/antiparticle
projections (at rest)

 =

(t  k)

(65)

1
2

11

if m = 0, however, we can only distinguish particles from antiparticles in momentum space
by the sign of p0, as usual; this is the same as the sign in (46). similarly, in this language,
the chiral projection operator is constructed from

5 = txyz = (cid:18) 

0

0

(cid:19)

(66)

however, as with spin, we must multiply by  in the correct place, obtaining

b5 = r  5

z =(cid:18) 0
k(cid:19)

z =(cid:18) k
0(cid:19)

(67)

(68)

(69)

(70)

(72)

(73)

1

as a result, even though 5 is a multiple of the identity, b5 is not, and the operators
2(t  b5) project h2 into the weyl subspaces c2  c2k as desired.

combining the spin and particle information, over the quaternionic subalgebra h  o
2 particle at rest, with 2 spin states,

determined by k and , we thus nd 1 massive spin- 1
namely

e =(cid:18) 1
k(cid:19)

e =(cid:18) k
1(cid:19)

whose antiparticle is obtained by replacing k by k (and changing the sign in (46)). we also
nd 1 massless spin- 1
2 particle involving k moving in the z-direction, with a single helicity
state,

which corresponds, as usual, to both a particle and its antiparticle. it is important to note
that

corresponds to a massless particle with the same helicity moving in the opposite direction, not
to a dierent particle with the opposite helicity. each of the above states may be multiplied
(on the right) by an arbitrary complex number.

there is also a single complex massless spin- 1

2 particle, with the opposite helicity, which

is given in momentum space by

z =(cid:18) 0
1(cid:19)

(71)

as with the other massless momentum space states, this describes both a particle and an
antiparticle. alone among the particles, this one does not contain k, and hence does not
depend on the choice of identication of a particular quaternionic subalgebra h satisfying
c  h  o.

5.4 spin operators

we saw in the previous section that the spin up particle state e is a simultaneous eigenvector
of the spin operator and particle projections, that is

remarkably, e is also an eigenvector of the remaining spin operators, namely

2blze = e = +e

although the eigenvalues are not real. similar statements hold for the corresponding spin
down and antiparticle states, although with dierent eigenvalues.

2blxe = e k

2blye = e k

12

we nd it illuminating to consider the equivalent right eigenvalue problem

lz = 

(74)

for the non-hermitian operator lz. the operator lz admits imaginary eigenvalues /2,
which correspond to the usual spin eigenstates. but lz also admits other imaginary eigen-

values! these correspond precisely to the eigenvalues of blz which are not real, and in fact

not in c. we emphasize that the spin operators are self-adjoint (with respect to (58)).
however, over the octonions it is not true that all the eigenvalues of hermitian matrices, are
real [22, 27]; the case of self-adjoint operators is similar.

how does it aect the traditional interpretation of quantum mechanics to have simulta-
neous eigenstates of all 3 spin operators? the essential feature which permits this is that
only one of the eigenvalues is real, and only real eigenvalues correspond to observables. thus,
from this point of view, the reason that the spin operators fail to commute is not that they
do not admit simultaneous eigenstates, but rather that their eigenvalues fail to commute!

furthermore, while (right) multiplication by a (complex) phase does not change any of
the real eigenvalues, the nonreal eigenvalues do depend on the phase, since the phase doesnt
commute with the eigenvalue! does this allow one in principle to determine the exact spin
orientation, even if no corresponding measurement exists?

6 discussion

we have shown how the massless dirac equation in 10 dimensions reduces to the (massive
and massless) dirac equation in 4 dimensions when a preferred octonionic unit is chosen.

the quaternionic dirac equation discussed in section 3 describes 1 massive particle with
2 spin states, 1 massless particle with only 1 helicity, and their antiparticles. we identify
this set of particles with a generation of leptons.

furthermore, as can be seen from figure 1, there is room in the octonions for exactly 3
such quaternionic descriptions which have only their complex part in common, corresponding
to replacing k in turn by i and j. we identify these 3 quaternionic spaces as describing 3
generations of leptons.

there is, however, one additional massless particle/antiparticle pair, given by (71). being
purely complex, it does not belong to any generation, and it has the opposite helicity from
the other massless particles. we do not currently have a physical interpretation for this
additional particle; if this theory is to correspond to nature, then this additional particle
must for some reason not interact much with anything else.

note that the mass appears in this theory as an overall scale, which can be thought of
as the length scale associated with the corresponding quaternionic direction. in particular,
antiparticles must have the same mass as the corresponding particles. this suggests that
the only free parameters in this theory are 3 length scales, corresponding to the masses in
each generation.

the theory presented here can be elegantly rewritten in terms of jordan matrices, i.e. 33
octonionic hermitian matrices, along the lines of the approach to the superparticle presented
in [20]. this approach, which is briey described in [24], demonstrates that the theory is

13

invariant under a much bigger group than the lorentz group, namely the exceptional group
e6 (actually, e7, since only conformal transformations are involved). we therefore believe
it may be possible to extend the theory so as to include quarks and color.

finally, as noted in [1], we have worked only in momentum space, and have discussed only
free particles. perhaps our most intriguing result is the observation that the introduction of
position space would require a preferred complex unit in the fourier transform. similarly,
a description of interactions based on minimal coupling would again involve a preferred
complex unit. therefore, it does not appear to be possible to use the formalism presented
here to give a full, interacting, 10-dimensional theory in which all 10 spacetime dimensions
are on an equal footing. we view this as a tantalizing hint that not only interactions, but
even 4-dimensional spacetime itself, may arise as a consequence of the symmetry breaking
from 10 dimensions to 4!
