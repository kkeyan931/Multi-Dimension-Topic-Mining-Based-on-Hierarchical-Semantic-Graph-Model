abstract

we review new aspects of integrable systems discovered recently in
n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories and their topologically twisted
versions. the main topics are (i) an explicit construction of whitham
deformations of the seiberg-witten curves for classical gauge groups, (ii)
its application to contact terms in the u-plane integral of topologically
twisted theories, and (iii) a connection between the tau functions and the
blowup formula in topologically twisted theories.

1 introduction

the seiberg-witten low energy eective action of four-dimensional n = 2 su-
persymmetric gauge theories (with and without matters) [1] is described by the
geometry of a family of complex algebraic curves (the seiberg-witten curves)
c bered over the coulomb moduli space u. each curve is equipped with a
meromorphic dierential (the seiberg-witten dierential) dssw. this dieren-
tial induces a special geometry on u with special coordinates aj and their
duals ad
j dened by the period integrals of dssw along suitable cycles j and
j on c. the prepotential f of this special geometry determines the eective
action.

shortly after the original su (2) theories of seiberg and witten were general-
ized to other gauge groups [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], a close connection with integrable
systems was discovered [9, 10], and further pursued [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29] as a guiding principle for the study of
n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories. this connection appears in two dier-
ent aspects. the rst aspect is a direct relation with integrable systems such

as the periodic toda systems and the elliptic calogero-moser systems. in this
connection, the seiberg-witten curves are interpreted to be the spectral curves
of a nite-dimensional integrable system, the special coordinates are nothing
but the action variables, and the electro-magnetic duality of the abelianized
theory is encoded into the structure of an associated polarized abelian variety.
thus the building blocks of the seiberg-witten eective theory t well to the
general setup of integrable systems, in particular, of algebraically integrable
systems [30, 31]. the second aspect is the notion of whitham deformations of
the spectral curve. this leads to a new interpretation of recursion relations of
instanton expansion [32] and the so called rg equation [33, 34].

in this paper, we review recent developments in these lines [35, 36, 37, 38,
39, 40, 41, 42, 43], mostly focussed on the connection with topologically twisted
n = 2 theories [44, 45, 46]. section 2 is a short summary of the fundamental
geometric stu (complex algebraic curves, dierentials, special coordinates and
prepotentials). section 3 is concerned with an explicit construction of whitham
deformations, which has been applied to instanton expansion and soft breaking
of n = 2 supersymmetry, as well as the topological theories. section 4 deals
with the relation to the topological theories in more detail. here a central role
is played by the notion of tau functions.

2 seiberg-witten geometry for classical gauge

groups

2.1 seiberg-witten geometry for su( + 1)

the seiberg-witten curve c for the gauge group su (+1) is a complex algebraic
curve of the form [9]

z +

2
z

= p (z) = x+1 

+1

xj=2

ujx+1j,

(2.1)

where  denotes the power +1 of the renormalization group parameter , and
ujs are the coulomb moduli. this is a hyperelliptic curve of genus . by the
simple transformation

z =

p (x) + y

2

,

(2.2)

the above equation can be indeed converted to the usual hyperelliptic equation

y2 = p (z)2  42.

(2.3)

the prepotential of the seiberg-witten eective theory is dened by use of
j (j = 1,    , ) on the coulomb moduli space u. these

special coordinates aj, ad

2

special coordinates are given by the period integrals 1

aj =

1

2iij

dssw,

ad
j =

1

2iij

dssw,

(2.4)

where j and j are a symplectic basis of cycles on the curve c, and dssw the
seiberg-witten dierential

dssw = x

dz
z

.

(2.5)

the integrals aj and ad
j give, respectively, a set of local coordinates on the
coulomb moduli space. if one interpret aj as such coordinates and the duals
ad
j as a function of the former, one can dene the prepotential f = f (a1,    , a)
as a solution of the equations

f
aj

= ad
j .

(2.6)

furthermore, the second derivatives of f reproduce the period matrix t =

(tjk)j,k=1,,:

2f

ajak

= tjk =

1

2iij

dk.

(2.7)

here dj (j = 1,    , ) are a basis of holomorphic dierentials on c normalized
as

1

2iij

dk = jk.

this matrix t appears in the analytic expression

jac(c)  c/(z + t z)

(2.8)

(2.9)

of the jacobi variety jac(c) of the curve c.

in the context of integrable systems, the curve c is nothing but the spectral
curve det(l(z)  xi) = 0 of a lax representation of the -periodic toda system,
i.e., the ane toda system of the a(1)
type; the lax pair is constructed in the

vector representation of sl( + 1).
it is well known [47, 48, 49, 50] that the
dynamics of this toda system is mapped to linear ows on the jacobi variety
jac(c). in a more abstract language, the 2-dimensional total space of the ber
bundle of the jacobi varieties over the coulomb moduli space u becomes an
algebraically integrable system [30, 31].

1as opposed to my previous papers [36, 39], i have inserted the factor 1/(2i), which
is rather standard in the physical literature. similar changes of convention have been done
throughout this paper.

2.2 seiberg-witten curves for other classical gauge groups

the seiberg-witten curves for other classical gauge groups (i.e., orthogonal and
symplectic groups) can be written

z +

2
z

= w (x),

where w (x) is a polynomial or a laurent polynomial of the form

(2.10)

(2.11)

so(2 + 1)

sp(2)

ujx22j
: w (x) = x1
xj=1
x2 
 .
: w (x) = x2
ujx22j
xj=1
x2 
 + 2.
ujx22j
: w (x) = x2
xj=1
x2 
 .



in the case of su ( + 1) and so(2), w (x) coincide with the superpotential
of the topological landau-ginzburg models (or d < 1 strings) for the a and
d isolated singularities [51, 52]. guided by this analogy, basic notions in the
topological landau-ginzburg models, such as the gauss-manin system and the
wdvv equations, have been generalized to the seiberg-witten eective theories
[53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58].

these curves coincide with the spectral curve det(l(z)  xi) = 0 of a lax
pair (in minimal dimensions) of an ane toda system, namely, the ane toda
(1) of
system associated with the dual lie algebra g
(1) for the non-simply
the gauge group g [10]. note that the dual lie algebra g
laced gauge groups so(2 + 1) and sp(2) is a twisted ane algebra.

(1) of the ane algebra g

all these curves are hyperelliptic. one can nd an equivalent expression in

the usual expression y2 = r(x) of hyperelliptic curves:

so(2 + 1)

sp(2)

so(2)

:

:

:

y2 = q(x2)2  42x2, z =(cid:0)q(x2) + y(cid:1)/2x.
y2 = q(x2)(cid:0)x2q(x2) + 4(cid:1), z =(cid:0)2 + x2q(x2) + xy(cid:1)/2.
y2 = q(x2)2  42x4, z =(cid:0)q(x2) + y(cid:1)/2.

actually, it is in this form (or the quotient curve c  discussed later on) that the
relevant complex algebraic curves for classical gauge groups were rst derived
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

2.3 involutions and prym varieties

the curves c for the orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups have two involu-
tions:

1
2

:
:

(x, y) 7 (x, y),
(x, y) 7 (x, y),

(x, z) 7 (x, 2/z),
(x, z) 7 (x, z).

(2.12)

4

the rst involution is the hyperelliptic involution, which also exists on the curve
for su ( + 1); the second involution is a characteristic of the other cases. the
quotient c2 = c/2 by the second involution is again a hyperelliptic curve.
some fundamental properties of these curves are summarized in the following
table.

the double covering c  c2 determines the prym variety prym(c/c2).
this is an -dimensional polarized abelian variety, which plays the role of the
jacobi variety jac(c) for the su (+1) gauge theory. let us specify the structure
of this prym variety in some detail [59].

in the complex analytic language, prym(c/c2) is a complex torus of the

form

prym(c/c2)  c/(z + 2p z),

(2.13)

where  is a diagonal matrix  = diag(d1,    , dn ) with positive integers on the
diagonal line, and p is a complex symmetric matrix (pjk) with positive denite
imaginary part. the diagonal elements of  represent the polarization:

sp(2)
so(2 + 1), so(2)

:
:

(d1,    , d) = (2,    , 2, 2),
(d1,    , d) = (2,    , 2, 1).

the matrix elements of p = (pjk) are given by the period integrals

pjk =

dj

4iij

dk,

(2.14)

(2.15)

where dj (j = 1,    , ) are holomorphic dierentials on c that are odd under
the action of 2, i.e.,

and uniquely determined by the normalization condition


2dj = dj,

1

2iij

dk = jk.

(2.16)

(2.17)

the cycles j , j (j = 1,    , ) in these period integrals have to be chosen as
follows:

 for sp(2): the 4 cycles j, 2(j), j, 2(j ) (j = 1,    , ) form a

symplectic basis of cycles of c.

 for so(2 + 1) and so(2): the homology classes [] and [] are odd
under the action of 2, i.e., 2([]) = [] and 2([]) = []. the 4
2 cycles j, 2(j), j, 2(j) (j = 1,    ,   1) and ,  altogether
form a symplectic basis of cycles of c.

in particular, these cycles have the intersection numbers j  k = jk, j  k =
j  k = 0.

5

2.4 special coordinates and prepotential

the seiberg-witten dierential for the orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups
is given by

dssw = x

dz
z

=

.

(2.18)

xw (x)dx

pw (x)2  42

this dierential, like dj, is odd under the action of 2:


2dssw = dssw.

(2.19)

given a set of cycles j, j as mentioned above, one can dene the special
j on the coulomb moduli space u by the period

coordinates aj and their duals ad
integrals

aj =

1

2iij

dssw,

ad
j =

1

2iij

dssw.

(2.20)

the prepotential f = f (a1,    , a) is again characterized by the dierential
equation

f
aj

= ad
j .

(2.21)

the matrix elements pjk of p can be expressed as second derivatives of the
prepotential:

2f

ajak

= pjk.

(2.22)

2.5 quotient curve of genus 

the prym variety prym(c/c2) can be identied, up to isogeny, with the jacobi
variety jac(c ) of the quotient curve c  = c/ obtained by the following
involution:

sp(2)
so(2 + 1), so(2)

:  = 2,
:  = 12.

(2.23)

the quotient curve c  is also hyperelliptic and has genus . the holomorphic
dierentials dj, as well as dssw, are even (i.e., invariant) under the action
of , so that they are the pull-back of dierentials on c . the matrix p is
actually the period matrix of c :

jac(c )  c/(z + p z).

(2.24)

to nd an explicit expression of c , one can use the following invariants 

and  of :

sp(2)
so(2 + 1), so(2)

:
:

 = x2,
 = x2,

 = y,
 = xy.

(2.25)

6

in terms of these coordinates, c  can be written as follows:

so(2 + 1)

sp(2)

so(2)

:

:

:

2 = (cid:16)q(2)  42(cid:17).
2 = q()(cid:16)q() + 4(cid:17).
2 = (cid:16)q()2  422(cid:17).

(2.26)

let us compare the two curves c and c . the curve c is a double covering of
the x-sphere and has two points p 
 at innity above x = . these two points
correspond to z =  and z = 0, and mapped to each other by the hyperelliptic
involution 1. this is a characteristic of the spectral curves of ane toda
systems [47, 48, 49, 50]. the curve c , in contrast, has a single point at innity
above the -shere, so that c  is branched over  = . hyperelliptic curves of
this type arise in the kdv hierarchy [47, 60, 61]. it is well known that the kdv
hierarchy is a specialization the kp hierarchy [63, 64, 65], in which only odd
time variables t2n1 remain non-trivial among all possible ows t1, t2, t3,   
of the kp hierarchy. we shall see a similar structure later on in whitham
deformations.

3 construction of whitham deformations

3.1 what are whitham deformations?

in all the aforementioned cases, the seiberg-witten dierential dssw plays the
role of a generating dierential, namely, dierentiating against the moduli uj
give a basis of (odd) holomorphic dierentials:

= dvj .

(3.1)


uj

ds(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

here (  )|z=const. means dierentiating while leaving z constant. for in-
stance, in the case of su ( + 1), the following holomorphic dierentials dvj are
thus reproduced:

dvj =

x+1jdx

y

(j = 2,    ,  + 1).

(3.2)

if we use aj as independent variables, the outcome are the normalized holo-

morphic dierentials:

= dj.

(3.3)

note that the moduli uj in this situation are a function uj = uj(~a) of ~a =
(a1,    , a), which gives an inverse of the period map ~u 7 ~a, ~u = (u2,    , u+1).
the curve c is now deformed as ~a varies, c = c(~a).


aj

ds(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

7

whitham deformations are an extension of these deformations with new
time variables tn (n = 1, 2,   ). more precisely, we consider the following
setup.

 the moduli uj of the curve c are deformed as a function uj = uj(~a, ~t )
of ~a and ~t = (t1, t2,   ). this induces a family of deformations c 7
c(~a, ~t ) of the curve c. at ~t = (1, 0, 0,   ), they are required to reduce
to the seiberg-witten family.
it should be noted that, apart from this
seiberg-witten point, the ajs are no longer identical to the special
coordinates for the deformed curve c(~a, ~t ) dened by the period integrals
of the seiberg-witten dierential on this curve.

 the following equations are satised:

= dn.

(3.4)


aj

ds(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

= dj,



tn

ds(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)z=const.

here dn (n = 1, 2,   ) are meromorphic dierentials of the second kind
with poles at p 
 only (with some more conditions on the singular part,
see below) and vanishing -periods

dn = 0

(j = 1,    , ),

(3.5)

ij

and ds is a linear combination of these meromorphic dierentials and the
normalized holomorphic dierentials of the form

tndn +

ds = xn1

n

xj=1

ajdj.

(3.6)

 ds reduces to dssw at ~t = (1, 0, 0,   ).

 for the prepotential f to be extended to this family of deformations, the
 (i.e., z =  and z = 0) should be of the

singular behavior of dn at p 
form

dn = df 

n (z) + non-singular,

(3.7)

where f 

n (z) is a polynomial in z with constant coecients.

3.2 construction of whitham deformations for su( + 1)

the solution of gorsky et al. [35] for the su ( + 1) gauge theory is constructed
by the following steps.

1. consider the meromorphic dierentials

d n = rn(x)

dz
z

, rn(x) =(cid:16)p (x)n/(+1)(cid:17)+

.

(3.8)

8

here (  )+ denotes the polynomial part of a laurent series of x. the
fractional power of p (x) is understood to be a laurent series of the form
xn+   at x = . since r1(x) = x, d 1 is nothing but the seiberg-witten
dierential.

2. consider the dierential

tnd n

ds = xn1

and its period integrals

aj =

1

2iij

ds = xn1

tn

2iij

d n.

(3.9)

(3.10)

these period integrals are functions of the moduli uj and the deformation
parameters tn. they determine a family of deformations of the seiberg-
witten period map ~u 7 ~a with parametes tn.

3. the period map ~u 7 ~a from the ~u-space to the ~a-space is invertible if ~t is
close to (1, 0, 0,   ), because the seiberg-witten period map at this point

is invertible. the inverse map ~a 7 ~u = (cid:16)u2(~a, ~t ),    , u+1(~a, ~t )(cid:17) gives

deformations of the seiberg-witten moduli uj = uj(~a), hence of the curve
c, with parameters tn.

4. the dierentials

dn = d n 

n

xj=1

c(n)
j dj,

c(n)
j =

1

2iij

d n

(3.11)

satisfy the required normalization condition. ds thereby becomes a linear
combination of dn and dj of the required form.

the following property of d n plays a central role in this construction:

 (/uj)d n|z=const. are holomorphic dierentials on c.

note that this is a generalization of the property of the seiberg-witten dieren-
tial that we have mentioned in the beginning of this section. once this property
is established, it is rather straightforward to verify that the other requirements
are indeed fullled.

somewhat delicate part is the determination of the laurent polynomials
. this can be worked out

f 
n (z) that represent the singular part of dn at p 
by using the identity

p (x)n/(+1) =(cid:16)z +

.

(3.12)

the singular part of laurent expansion of the right hand side at z =  or
z = 0 determines the laurent polynomials f 
n (z). obviously the singular part

2

z (cid:17)n/(+1)

9

is a laurent polynomial with constant coecients. accordingly f 
out to have constant coecients.

n (z), too, turn

having this solution, we can now dene the prepotential f = f (~a, ~t ) by the

equation

f

(2i)2 ip +

(3.13)

the second derivatives are also related to period integrals:

2f

n (z)dj,

f 
m(z)dn. (3.14)

in particular, the second derivatives 2f /ajak are identical to the matrix
elements of the period matrix t for the deformed curve c(~a, ~t ). moreover, by
riemanns bilinear relation, the mixed derivatives can also be written

2f

ajtn

= 

1

2iij

dn.

(3.15)

gorsky et al. [35] further proceeded to calculating these period integrals ex-
plicitly. this yields a formula for the second derivatives 2f /tmtn (m, n =
1,    , ) in terms of a theta function, which is related to contact terms of topo-
logically twisted n = 2 theories. we shall return to this issue later on.

3.3 solutions for other classical gauge groups

a new feature that arises in the orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups is the
parity: the dierentials and cycles in the seiberg-witten geometry have to
respect the parity under the action of the involutions. this is also the case
for whitham deformations. apart from this feature, it is straightforward to
generalize the method of gorsky et al. [35] to the other classical gauge groups,
which we now present below [39].

the rst step of the construction is to seek for suitable meromorphic dier-

entials of the form

d n = rn(x)

dz
z

, rn(x) = polynomial,

(3.16)

with the following properties:

10

 rn(x) is an odd polynomial.

 (/uj)d n|z=const. are holomorphic dierentials on c.

a solution to this problem can be found by applying the fractional power con-
struction to w (x):

so(2 + 1)

sp(2)

so(2)

: rn(x) =(cid:16)w (x)(2n1)/(21)(cid:17)+
: rn(x) =(cid:16)w (x)(2n1)/(2+2)(cid:17)+
: rn(x) =(cid:16)w (x)(2n1)/(22)(cid:17)+

,

,

.

(3.17)

note that rn(x) is a polynomial of the form xn +   . in particular, as in the
case of su ( + 1), d 1 is nothing but the seiberg-witten dierential dssw.

the other part of the construction is fully parallel to the case of su ( + 1).
we have only to pay an extra attention to the parity. it is easy to see that the
dierentials ds, d n, dn and dj are odd under the action of the involution
of 2.

the involution  and the quotient curve c  = c/ lead to an alternative
view. the dierentials ds, d n, dn and dj are all invariant under the in-
volution . accordingly, they actually descend to (or, equivalently, are the
pull-back of) dierentials on c  = c/.

the status of the meromorphic dierentials dn is particularly interesting
from the second point of view. these meromorphic dierentials have two poles
at p 
. since these two points are mapped to the same point q ( = )
of c , the corresponding meromorphic dierentials on c  have a single pole at
q, and by a direct calculation, one can see that this is a pole of order 2n. as
already mentioned, this is a property shared by the meromorphic dierentials
that arise in the kdv hierarchy. more precisely, the singular behavior of those
meromorphic dierentials at q is such that

dkdv

n = dn1/2 + non-singular.

(3.18)

our meromorphic dierentials dn are a linear combination of those normal-
ized meromorphic dierentials.

4 application to topologically twisted n = 2

theories

4.1 tau functions and modular transformations

the algebro-geometric tau functions of integrable hierarchies (kp, toda, etc.)
are determined by a set of algebro-geometric data (the so called krichever data)
including a non-singular complex algebraic curve (riemann surface) c of genus

11

g [48, 61, 62, 66, 67]. such a tau function can be generally written

 (~t) = e2iq(~t)(xn

tnvn + c | t ),

~t = (t1, t2,   ).

let us consider the algebro-geometric tau functions of the kp hierarchy in a
somewhat non-standard (in the sense specied below) formulation. the algebro-
geometric data are a non-singular algebraic curve c of genus g with a marked
point q, a local coordinate  in a neighborhood of q with (q) = 0, a
set of polynomials fn() (n = 1, 2,   ) in 1 with constant coecients, and
a symplectic basis j, j (j = 1,    , g) of cycles on c. (this is the setup that
we encounter when the seiberg-witten geometry for orthogonal and symplectic
gauge groups is reformulated in the language of the quotient curve c .) let dj

furthermore, a set of meromorphic dierentials dn (n = 1, 2,   ) are uniquely

remarks

1. in the standard formulation of the kp hierarchy, fn() is chosen to be
n, so that the condition on the singular behavior of dn at q becomes

dn = dn + non-singular.

(4.10)

accordingly, the denition of qmn and v (m)

has to be modied as

qmn =

(4.11)

but the other part remains intact. the aforementioned formulation is
simply to take an arbitrary set of directional vectors for the time variables
tn in this standard formulation of the kp hierarchy.

2. in particular, suppose that if c is a hyperelliptic curve of the form

2 = r() = 2g+1 + c12g +    + c2g+1,

(4.12)

q the point at innity  = , and  is given by

 = 1/2.

(4.13)

then in the standard formulation as mentioned above, all even members
d2n of the meromorphic dierentials become exact,

d2n = dn.

13

(4.14)

thereby the directional vectors v2n for the even time variables t2n all
vanish. the coecients qmn of the gaussian factor also vanish for even
indices. this means that all the even ows become trivial, so that the
kp hierarchy reduces to the kdv hierarchy.

example related to toda hierarchy

an immediate generalization of the kp-like setup is such that the algebraic
curve has two marked points p 
. suppose that a local coordinate  at p 

(with (p 
) = 0) and a symplectic basis j, j of cycles are given. this
is exactly the setup for constructing an algebro-geometric tau function of the
toda hierarchy [68] (which is a hierarchy obtained from the two-dimensional
su () toda eld theory). a standard formulation is to introduce two series of
time variables t
. we
now consider a suitable linear combinations tn of those standard ows. (this is
indeed the setup that takes place in the seiberg-witten geometry for su ( + 1)
gauge groups.) this linear combination is specied by a set polynomials f 
n ()
in 1
 with constant coecients. given these data, one can dene meromorphic
dierentials dn by the following conditions:

n (n = 1, 2,   ) associated with the two marked points p 

 dn is non-singular outside p 

, has two poles at p 

, and the leading

part of singularity at p 

 is given by dfn(),

dn = df 

n () + non-singular.

(4.15)

 the -periods of dn vanish,

(4.19)

these relations are also crucial in understanding the role of the whitham de-
formations and the tau functions in topologically twisted n = 2 theories.

we now turn to the modular property of these tau functions and its building
blocks. actually, this issue was studied in the eighties in the context of free
fermions on a riemann surface [69, 70]. the modular property turns out to
be model-independent, i.e., apply to the aforementioned general setup without
specifying the integrable system, the algebro-geometric data, etc. [36]

the rst step is to determine the transformations of the building blocks of

the tau functions under the symplectic transformations

j 7 ajkk + bjkk,
j 7 cjkk + djkk,

(cid:18) a b
c d (cid:19)  sp(2g, z)

of cycles. this induces the well known transformation

t 7 (at + b)(ct + d)1

(4.20)

(4.21)

of the period matrix t , which stands for the period matrix p of jac(c ) if we
consider the case of orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups. the normalized
holomorphic dierentials dj and the meromorphic dierentials dn transform
as

dj

7 [(ct + d)1]kj dk,

dn

7 dn 

1
2i

[(ct + d)1c]kj ij

dn  dk.

(4.22)

accordingly, qmn and v (n)

transform as

v (n)
j

qmn

7 [(ct + d)1]kj v (n)
7 qmn  [(ct + d)1c]kj v (m)

k

,

j

v (n)
k

.

(4.23)

it should be noted that these transformations already signal a possible connec-
tion with the contact terms in the u-plane integral of topological theories, which
are known to obey substantially the same transformations.

the next steps is to combine these transformations with the modular prop-
erty of theta functions. to this end, we introduce the theta functions with
characteristics,

[, ](w | t )

= xnzg

exp(cid:16)i(n + )  t (n + ) + 2i(n + )  (w + )(cid:17).

(4.24)

15

these theta functions are known to obey the following modular transformations
[71]:

[, ](cid:16)t(ct + d)1w | (at + b)(ct + d)1(cid:17)

=  det(ct + d)1/2 exp(iw  (ct + d)1cw)[, ](w | t ). (4.25)

here  is a eighth root of unity and [, ] a transformed theta characteristic,
both of which are determined by the symplectic matrix.

we now examine the modular property of tau functions of the form

,(~t) = e2iq(~t)[, ](xn

tnvn | t ).

(4.26)

here (and in the following), q(~t) is purely quadratic:

q(~t) =

1

2xm,n

qmntmtn.

(4.27)

as the identity

[, ](w | t ) = e2i(w+)(w + t  +  | t )

(4.28)

implies, this is a special case of the aforementioned tau functions. one may
consider the more general tau functions, but these tau functions ,(~t) turn out
to possess a better modular property. from the modular transformations of the
theta functions, indeed, we readily nd that these tau functions transform as

,(~t) 7  det(ct + d)1/2 ,(~t).

(4.29)

note that the multiplicative factor of the transformation is independent of ~t;
this is not the case for the more general tau function. this fact, too, is a key to
search for a connection with topological theories.

4.2 u-plane integrals and contact terms in topologically

twisted n = 2 theories

the topological twisting of an n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory gives a
topological eld theory that detects the topology of the (compactied) four-
dimensional space-time x [72]. in the following, we consider the case where x
is simply connected. the topological information is encoded in the correlators
of observables, which are obtained by successively applying a descent operator
g to the casimirs of the scalar eld  in the n = 2 vector multiplet, then
integrating over a homology cycle of x.

in the simply connected case, the relevant observables are supported by
zero- and two-dimensional cycles. the correlators of those zero- and two-cycle
observables can be collected into the generating function

z =*exp(cid:16)xj

fkok +xn

gnin(s)(cid:17)+ ,

(4.30)

16

where ok and in(sn) are observables supported by a zero-cycle (point) qk and
a two-cycle (surface) sn, and fk and gn are their coupling constants. thus ok
is just the value of a casimir of  at qk (whose position itself is irrelevant in
the correlators), and in(sn) is an integral of the form

in(sn) =zsn

g2pn,

(4.31)

where pn is yet another casimir of . in the case of the su (2) gauge group,
these correlators give the donaldson invariants of x [73, 74].

if, however, x is a manifold with b+

2 (x) = 1 (e.g., complex rational sur-
faces), those observables loose topological invariance, and exhibit the so called
chamber structure or wall crossing phenomena. moore and witten [44]
proposed a eld theoretical interpretation of this phenomena, postulating that
z is the sum

z = zd + zu

(4.32)

of contributions of the strong coupling singularities and the bulk of the coulomb
moduli space (u-plane) u. they determined an explicit form of zu by ex-
amining the modular property of the (low energy eective) theory under the
sp(2, z) duality group ( being the rank of the gauge group). this is nothing
but the group of symplectic transformations cycles in c that we have discussed.
the outcome is an integral of the form

zu =zu

[dada]ab exp(u +xm,n

where a and b are given by the formulae

gmgnsm  sntmn),

(4.33)

a = (det uk/aj)1/2, b = 1/8,

(4.34)

 and  are some constants, and  is essentially the discriminant of w (x)242;
 and  are the euler characteristic and the signature of x; u is a collection of
the eects of the zero-cycle observables; sm sn is the intersection number of sm
and sn; tmn are the contact terms of the two-cycle observables;  is a lattice
sum evaluating the photon partition function in the eective u (1) theory.

our main concern lies in the contact terms. according to moore and witten
[44] (for su (2)) and marino and moore [46] (for other gauge groups), the contact
terms are uniquely determined by the following properties:

 under the sp(2, z) duality group, they transform as

tmn 7 tmn 

1
4i

[(ct + d)1c]jk

pm
aj

pn
ak

.

 in the semi-classical (i.e., weak coupling) limit as /aj  0,

tmn  0.

17

(4.35)

(4.36)

note that pn is understood to be a function on u. also recall that the matrix
t stands for the relevant -dimensional abelian variety  the period matrix t
of jac(c) in the case of su ( + 1) gauge groups, and the period matrix p of
jac(c ) in the case of orthogonal and symplectic gauge groups.

remarkably, the modular transformations of the contact terms tmn are es-
sentially of the same form as the modular transformations of qmn. (note that
(ct + d)1c is a symmetric matrix.) one might thus naively guess that tmn
is identical to qmn (up to a multiplicative constant). this comparison also sug-
gests to identify pn/aj with v (n)
. this implies that, upon turning on the
whitham deformations, pn are given by

j

pn = const.

,

(4.37)

f ( ~t )

tn (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ~t =(1,0,0,)

because of the relation v (n)

j = 2f ( ~t )/ajtn in the whitham deformations.
a trouble in this naive identication is that qmn do not fulll the correct
semi-classical property mentioned above.2 a correct identication, as pointed
out by gorsky et al.[35], is achieved upon subtracting a singular part qsing
mn from
qmn:

tmn = const.(qmn  qsing

mn ).

(4.38)

of course, the subtracted term qsing
mn must be modular invariant in order to
retain the aforementioned modular property. gorsky et al. worked out this
separation for the su ( + 1) theory by evaluating the period integrals for qmn =
2f /tmtn, and obtained the formula

qmn  qsing

mn = 

22
(2i)2

 log e(0 | t )

hm+1

hn+1

tjk

aj

ak

,

(4.39)

where  = 2 + 2, e is a theta function with an even half-characteristic, and
hn+1 is dened by the residue

hn+1 =

 + 1

n

res
x=

p (x)n/(+1)dx.

(4.40)

thus in order to complete the identication, we have to interpret pn as hn+1
(up to a multiplicative constant). the singular part qsing

mn itself is dened by

qsing
mn = 


2i

hm+1,n+1,

(4.41)

where

hm+1,n+1 =

 + 1
mn

res
x=

p (x)m/(+1)d(p (x)n/(+1))+.

(4.42)

it should be also noted that these calculations are valid for the range of m, n  
only.

2i overlooked this problem and wrongly identied tmn with qmn in my previous papers

[36, 39]. i would like to take advantage of this opportunity to correct this error.

18

4.3 blowup formula and tau functions

another approach to the evaluation of contact terms is based on the blowup
formula. the aforementioned theta formula of contact terms was indeed rst
derived by losev et al. [45] using the technique of blowup. the blowup formula
was reformulated by moore and witten [44] and by marino and moore [46] in
the language of the u-plane integral. this reveals a close connection to the
tau functions ,(~t).
in particular, as marino pointed out recently [43], the
theta function in the aforementioned formula of contact terms is actually the
same as the theta function in the tau function. we present an outline of these
observations below.

the blowup formula relates the topological correlators between x, which is
now assumed to be a complex algebraic surface with b+
2 (x) = 1, and its blowup
x at a point q of x. the inverse image of q in the blowup map x  x is a
rational curve (called an exceptional curve) with self-intersection 1. let b
denote its homology class in h2( x, z). the eect of blowup on the homology
is simply to add to h2(x, z) a rank one module generated by b:

h2( x, z) = h2(x, z)  zb.

(4.43)

one can now insert a set of observables in(b) supported by b into the gener-
ating function on x:

z x =*exp(cid:16)xk

fkok +xn

gnin(s) +xn

tnin(b)(cid:17)+ .

(4.44)

according to the formulation of marino and moore [46], the eect of blowup in
the u-plane integral is to modify the integrand for x as follows:

1. in accordance with the decomposition of h2 mentioned above, the photon
partition function  x becomes a product of x and a theta function with
an even half-characteristic:

 x = [0, ](xn

tnvn | t )x ,

 = (1/2,    , 1/2).

(4.45)

2. the exponential function containing contact terms undergoes a new con-
tribution from the observables supported by b, which appear as the mul-
tiplicative factor

exp(xm,n

tmntmtn).

(4.46)

the negative sign in the exponent stems from the self-intersection b  b =
1 of the exceptional divisor.

3. the euler characteristic and the signature change as: ( x) = (x) + 1,

( x) = (x)  1. the measure factor ab is thereby multiplied by

ab1 = det(uk/aj)1/21/8.

(4.47)

19

let us consider the product of the rst two factors (i.e., the gaussian and

the theta function), which we call 0,(~t):

0,(~t) = exp(xm,n

tmntmtn)[0, ](xn

tnvn | t ).

(4.48)

marino and moore [46] remarked that this is essentially the tau function of the
toda system. more precisely, as we have mentioned, this diers from the true
tau function 0,(~t) by a gaussian factor exp(2iqsing(~t)), where qsing(~t) is the
quadratic form with coecients qsing

mn . thus we have

0,(~t) = exp(qsing(~t))0,(~t)

= exp(2i(q(~t)  qsing(~t))[0, ](xn

tnvn | t ).

(4.49)

since the subtracted term qsing(~t) is modular invariant, this modication does
not spoil the modular transformation of 0,(~t); the subtraction is necessary for
the correct semi-classical behavior of the integrand of the u-plane integral.

moreover, according to marino [43], the third factor in the blowup process

is nothing but the inverse of the zero-value of 0,(~t):

ab1 =

1

0,(~0)

,

~0 = (0, 0,   ).

the product of the three factor thus boils down to the tau quotient

0,(~t)
0,(~0)

=

0,(~t)
0,(~0)

.

(4.50)

(4.51)

since 0,(~t) and 0,(~0) have the same modular property, the quotient is modular
invariant  a property to be required for the consistency of the u-plane integral.
furthermore, this quotient has to be non-singular in the semi-classical region of
the u-plane. on the basis of these requirements, marino [43] eventually derives
the theta formula

tmn = 2i

 log [0, ](0 | t )

tjk

v (m)
j

v (n)
k

,

(4.52)

thus reproducing the theta formula of gorsky et al. [35] from an entirely dier-
ent route. this result also also shows that the theta function e in the formula
of gorsky et al. is actually given by [0, ].

5 conclusion

we have seen some new aspects of integrable systems discovered in the recent
studies of n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories and the topologically twisted
versions. a particularly impressive lesson is that the combination of whitham

20

deformations and tau functions can be a surprisingly powerful tool. this fact
is demonstrated in marinos beautiful exposition [43], part of which we have
reviewed in the last section.

a number of problems still remain to be addressed. a central issue will be
to extend the present approach based on integrable systems to other cases, such
as the theories with matter multiplets, exceptional gauge groups, etc. contact
terms and the blowup formula for theories with matter multiplets have been
studied to some extent [44, 45, 46]. perhaps the most intriguing are the theories
with an adjoint matter multiplet (equivalently, the mass deformed n = 4 theo-
ries). the blowup formula in the topological versions of these theories, too, will
be described by some tau function (of an elliptic calogero-moser system?). an-
other interesting case can be found in toroidally compactied tensionless strings
(also called e-strings) and related n = 2 or mass deformed n = 4 gauge the-
ories [75, 76, 77, 78, 79]. the e8 theta function e8 arising in those models
will be connected with the tau function of a yet unidentied integrable system
underlying the seiberg-witten curves of those theories.
