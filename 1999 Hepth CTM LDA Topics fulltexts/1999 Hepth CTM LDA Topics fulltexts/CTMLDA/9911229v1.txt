abstract

the open descendants of simple current automorphism invariants
are constructed. we consider the case where the order of the current
is two or odd. we prove that our solutions satisfy the completeness
conditions, positivity and integrality of the open and closed sectors
and the klein bottle constraint (apart from an interesting exception).
in order to do this, we derive some new relations between the tensor y
and the xed point conformal eld theory. some non-standard klein
bottle projections are considered as well.

1 introduction

after a ten year period of neglect, open strings have received more interest
recently for a variety of reasons: their role in the duality picture, the dis-
covery of d-branes and the appearance of non-commutative geometry, and
recent developments in phenomenological string theory, such as brane world
scenarios and large extra dimensions. it is therefore worthwhile to explore
open string vacua in more detail.

a rst step in the classication of open string theories is a classication
of closed string theories. this amounts to classifying all possible modular
invariants. there exists a systematic way of building modular invariants
using simple currents [2]. this turns out to be very powerful: apart from
the charge conjugation invariant and a few sporadic exceptions, all modular
invariants can be built with the use of simple currents.this suggests the
possibility that also in the open string case simple currents should play a
crucial role in a systematic approach. furthermore simple current properties
are not specic for one particular type of conformal eld theories (such as
wzw models), but they are generic. it is precisely a generic cft description
of open strings that we are after.

a modular invariant can be of automorphism type or extension type or
products thereof. the rst ones are permutations of the primary elds that
leave the fusion rules invariant. among them are the diagonal and charge
conjugation invariant. theories described by an extension invariant always
contain extra currents that extend the chiral algebra. the modular invariant
of this extension is then again of automorphism type. this extension proce-
dure does not raise any new problem in open string theories. therefore we
only need to consider pure automorphism invariants.

a second ingredient in the construction of open descendants is the clas-
sication of boundary conditions for a given bulk theory. a bulk theory
is specied by a chiral algebra and a particular modular invariant that de-
scribes the pairing between left- and rightmoving representations of this al-
gebra. the boundary conditions are encoded in the boundary coecients
bb. these have the following intuitive interpretation. when a eld b ap-
proaches a boundary , it gets reected to its charge conjugate bc with a
strength proportional to bb. throughout this letter, we will assume that
the boundaries leave the bulk symmetry invariant.

in the case that all elds couple to their charge conjugate, cardy [3] con-

2

jectured the boundary coecients for a generic conformal eld theory. we
will refer to this as the c-diagonal case.
in general, the boundary coe-
cients are constrained by sewing constraints [4] [5]. unfortunately, these
constraints require knowledge of ope-coecients and duality (fusing and
braiding) matrices, which are only known in a limited number of cases, such
as su(2) wzw models. the authors of [5] [6] found the boundary coe-
cients for the dodd automorphism invariants of su(2) wzw models by
solving these sewing constraints. furthermore, they postulated very restric-
tive conditions for the annulus coecients (open string state multiplicities)
known as the completeness conditions. these conditions have the advantage
that they do not involve duality matrices, so that they are applicable in all
cases. fuchs and schweigert [7] generalized this to the boundary coecients
for an arbitrary order 2, half-integer spin simple current invariant. they con-
structed the corresponding annulus coecients and showed that these were
integer and satised the completeness conditions.

a third ingredient in the construction of open descendants are the klein
bottle and mobius strip amplitudes. in short, the klein bottle projects the
closed string spectrum, described by the torus, to an unoriented one and the
mobius strip does the same with the open spectrum, which is described by
the annulus. the description of klein bottle and mobius strip requires the
introduction of another set of quantities, the crosscap coecients b, which
together with the boundary coecients bb form the set of data needed for a
complete description of open string spectra. the introduction of crosscaps to
the string worldsheet leads to extra sewing constraints, the so-called crosscap
constraints [8]. these again require knowledge of the  in general unknown
 duality matrices. since general formulas for duality matrices are not likely
to be available soon, any attempt to arrive at a generic cft description will
have to be less ambitious. instead of trying to solve all consistency conditions
we will focus here on a non-trivial but accessible subset. this is somewhat
analogous to the situation with closed string construction. although in prin-
ciple one would have to check duality of the four-point function on the sphere,
in practice it is usually sucient, and much simpler, to check modular in-
variance on the torus. the conditions we will consider in this paper are
the aforementioned completeness conditions, positivity and integrality of the
open and closed string partition functions, and a klein bottle constraint,
formulated in [9], as an alternative to the crosscap constraint. we require
these constraints to be satised for any cft, thus focusing on those solutions

3

that are most likely to survive the full set of sewing constraints. since our
solutions are simple current related there may in fact be a chance that simple
current relations among the duality matrices are sucient to prove that all
sewing conditions are satised, if they are satised in the c-diagonal case.

until now, only in the c-diagonal case there exists a general prescription
to construct open descendants. this is based on the conjecture of cardy,
extended with a conjecture for the crosscap. it was generalized to a class
of simple current related crosscap coecients, and it was shown that all
consistency conditions mentioned in the previous paragraph are satised.
in this letter we will provide the prescription for the construction of open
descendants in case of pure automorphism modular invariants built from odd
order and order 2 simple currents.

the rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we review the
method of open descendants. in section 3 we present solutions of the con-
sistency conditions for automorphism invariants built from odd order simple
currents. this case is relatively simple because of the absence of short or-
bits. non-standard klein bottle projections are discussed in a subsection.
section 4 is devoted to the construction of open descendants of order 2 sim-
ple current automorphism invariants. due to the possibility of xed points,
this case is harder to deal with and we nd that the correct crosscap coe-
cient requires a subtle sign choice. in some rare cases, the naive version of
the klein bottle constraint is violated and we comment on a possible solu-
tion. some essential relations involving various types of generalized fusion
coecients are derived in appendix a.

2 open descendants

in this section we review the method of open descendants, based on the
original work of [1] [3] [9]. the closed sector is described by a modular
invariant torus partition function

ziji j

,

t = xij

(1)

where the index i labels the (primary) elds and the matrix zij is the modular
invariant that commutes with the modular transformations s and t . we
will only be interested in the case where zij is a pure automorphism, so that

4

it has entries that are 0 or 1. a bar on the characters i denotes anti-
holomorphic. we will introduce a name for the elds that couple to their
charge conjugate in the torus: transverse channel elds, or transverse elds
for short, and denote them by a, b. this name is justied since only these
elds can survive near a crosscap or boundary, and therefore only these elds
can propagate in the transverse channels.

the closed oriented theory is projected to an unoriented theory by the
klein bottle partition function k. this partition function, or direct channel
amplitude, is related by a channel transformation s to the transverse channel
k:

k = xi

kii s

k = xi

2

i i

where ki = xb

sbibb .

(2)

the klein bottle has to satisfy two consistency conditions. the rst condition
guarantees that the closed string sector (t + k)/2 has positive, integral state
multiplicities:

(3)
where i = 1 for zii = 1 and i = 0 for zii = 0. these signs have to satisfy
an additional constraint, namely

ki = izii

,

ijkn k

ij  0 ,

(4)

ij

where n k
are the fusion coecients given by verlindes formula [11]. this
condition, which we will refer to as the klein bottle constraint, guarantees
that states that are projected out by the klein bottle cannot re-appear as
intermediate states in tree diagrams.

the open sector is described by the direct annulus channel a and direct
mobius channel m. they are related to the transverse channels a and m
by a channel transformation, which is s in case of the annulus and p =
t st 2st for the mobius strip:
aii s

bbbbb

(5)

a = xi

sbibbbb ,

pbibbb ,

(6)

m = xi

mi i p

a = xb
where ai = xb
m = xb
where mi = xb

bbb b

5

where the hatted characters are dened by i = (ti)1i. the indices
,  label the boundary conditions. to ensures that the open sector, given
by (a + m)/2 has non-negative, integer state degeneracies, the annulus and
mobius strip coecients have to satisfy

|mi|  ai and mi = ai mod 2 .

(7)

we will refer to this condition as the positivity and integrality condition.
furthermore, the annulus coecients have to satisfy the completeness con-
ditions of [5]. this is automatically the case if the reection coecients
rb = bbsb0 satisfy [12]
rbr

rbr

c = bc .

(8)

xb

b =  ; x

these conditions will not be considered anymore, since they do not involve
the crosscap coecients. that they are satised follows from the results of
[7], from which we obtain our boundary coecients.

to summarize: in the construction of open descendants, for a given mod-
ular invariant and consistent klein bottle projection, we have to nd the
correct annulus and mobius coecients. this amounts to nding a set of
boundary labels  and coecients bb and b such that equations (3), (4), (7)
and (8) are satised. let us present the only model-independent solution that
is presently known, in its most general form. it holds for charge conjugation
invariants, the so-called c-diagonal [3] case. the relevant coecients are in
this case [10]

bb =

sbsbl

, b =

pblsbl

,

ki = yillc

, ai = nlci,

, mi = ylc,li

,

where l is a simple current and the tensor y is dened as

y k

ij = xm

smipmjp k
m

sm0

.

a crucial relation, derived in [10] using results from [13], is

|y k
i0 |  n k

ii

and y k

i0 = n k

ii mod 2 .

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

in [10] it was shown that this relation implies that all constraints are satised.

6

3 zodd simple current invariants

first we review some facts about simple currents [2] [14]. an important
quantity is the (monodromy) charge of a eld i with respect to j

qj (i) = hj + hi  hj i mod 1 ,

(13)

where the hi are the conformal weights of i. the order of a simple current is
the smallest integer n for which j n = 0. the charge of a simple current with
respect to itself is qj (j) = r/n mod 1 where r is the monodromy parame-
ter. in [2] it is explained how we can construct modular invariant partition
functions with simple currents1. the result for odd n can be summarized as
follows: the modular invariant is of pure automorphism type if and only if
the monodromy parameter r and the order n do not have common factors.
all primaries in a theory with such a current are organized in orbits of
length n. the charges of these elds with respect to j are multiples of r/n,
and every charge appears precisely once on a given orbit. we will denote the
charge-zero elds by i0.

the following torus is modular invariant [2]:

n

t = xi0

xn=1

[j ni0] [j nic
0]

.

(14)

note that the charge-zero elds are the transverse elds. the diagonal part
of this partition function is

zii = ci0i0

,

(15)

where c denotes the charge conjugation matrix. so a eld i appears di-
agonally in the torus when the charge-zero eld on the orbit it lies on is
self-conjugate.

as an ansatz for the boundary and crosscap coecients we take 2

bb = n

sbsb0

, b = n

pb0sb0

,

(16)

1we multiply the modular invariants found in [2] by the charge conjugation matrix cij .

the result is of course a modular invariant as well.

2this is a straightforward generalization of the results of [7]. the classifying algebra is

in our case just the charge-zero subalgebra of the fusion rules.

7

where b labels the transverse elds and the index  the boundary condi-
tions, which are in one-to-one correspondence with the orbits. note that the
boundary coecient is independent of a representative, since b is chargeless
and so sb,j t = sb for any t.
it is straightforward to compute the other
coecients

ki =

n

xn=1

yj ni,00

, ai =

n

xn=1

nj ni,

, mi =

yj n,0i

.

(17)

n

xn=1

note that in all three expressions only one term contributes. for instance
the klein bottle coecient can be written as ki = yi000, so it equals the
frobenius-schur indicator of the orbit to which i belongs. we will postulate
that nonzero frobenius-schur indicators are conserved in fusion. possible
violations of this postulate and possible consequences will be discussed in
section 4.3. if the postulate holds the klein bottle constraint (4) is satised.
with equation (12) it is straightforward to check positivity and integral-
ity of the open sector, equation (7). furthermore it may be shown that
the annulus coecient respects the completeness conditions. this is strong
evidence for the correctness of our ansatz (16).

3.1 non-standard klein bottles

in [10] we developed a method for constructing non-trivial klein bottles with
the use of simple currents in the c-diagonal case. simple current klein bottles
can be constructed for zodd simple current invariants as well. let l be an
order m simple current with arbitrary spin. then

k [l]

i = e2iql(i0)yi000 = yi0llc

(18)

is a consistent klein bottle. reality of this klein bottle follows from the
observation that ql(i0) is (half-)integer when i0 is real. when i0 is complex,
a possible imaginary phase factor is killed by the frobenius-schur indicator.
the klein bottle constraint (4) follows from the conservation of ql in fusion.
the other coecients are

b = n
b[l]

a[l]

i =

n

xn=1

, [l]

b = n

sbsbl
n[j nlci],, , m [l]

,

pblsbl
xn=1

n

i =

y[j nlc],l,i

(19)

(20)

.

it is straightforward to show that the various consistency conditions are sat-
ised.

4 z2 simple current invariants

in this section we discuss the open descendants of modular invariants built
from order 2 simple currents. only when the spin of the current is half-
integer is the resulting invariant a pure automorphism [2]. there are three
kinds of orbits:
length 2 orbits that contain charge-zero elds i0, length 2
orbits that contain charge-one-half elds i1 and length 1 orbits (xed points)
that contain charge-one-half elds f . let j denote such a half-integer spin,
order 2 simple current. the following torus is modular invariant [2]:

t = xi0

i0 ic

0 +xi1

i1 (j i1)c +xf

f f c

.

(21)

the authors of [7] were able to nd the boundary coecients:

bb = 2  sbsb0!

bb,f  =

1

2   sbfsb0!
2   sbfsb0!

for q(b) = 0 ,

(22)

for

jb = b .

(23)

bb = 0

1

bb,f  = 

where, in the case of wzw-models, s is the s-matrix of the xed point
conformal eld theory (fcft) [2], or, more generally, the orbit lie-algebra
[17]. in section 4.2 we will comment on its denition in general conformal
eld theories. note that there is one boundary coecient  for every length
2 orbit and two boundary coecients f  for every xed point. as an ansatz
for the crosscap coecient we take

b =

1
2

[pb0 + j,mpbj ]

sb0

,

(24)

where j,m = ei[hj + m+2
the odd integer m is dened in section 4.2. the klein bottle becomes

2 ] = 1, whose appearance will become clear later.

ki =

1
2

[yi00 + yij j + 2j,myi0j]

.

(25)

9

using relations from the appendix of [10] one can show that for chargeless
elds the klein bottle is yi00 and for charged elds (including xed points) it is
j,myi0j . there are cases (although rare) where (25) violates the klein bottle
constraint (4). in section 4.3 we will comment on this issue and propose a
slightly weaker version of the klein bottle condition that is satised by all
models. the annulus [7] and mobius coecients become

ai = ni + nj i,

, aif g =

aif  = nif

, aif g =

1
2

mi = y0i + yj i

[nif g + nif g]

,

1
2

,

[nif g  nif g]
1
2

, mif  =

[yf 0i + j,myf j i]

,

(26)

(27)

(28)

where nif g is dened in equation (59). the annulus coecients satisfy [7]
the completeness conditions of [5]. the positivity and integrality condition
for boundary coecients that are not xed points follows from equation (12).
for boundary coecients that are xed points, we have to prove

1
2|yf 0i + j,myf j i| 
1
[yf 0i + j,myf j i] =
2

1
2
1
2

[nif f + nif f ]

,

[nif f + nif f ] mod 2 .

(29)

(30)

due to the appearance of the n, equation (12) is not applicable in this case.
however, note that for i = (i1, f ) the above relations are easily satised,
since both sides vanish by charge conservation. in appendix a we prove the
above positivity and integrality condition for i = i0. note that without the
sign j,m in equation (24), the positivity and integrality condition will be
violated for theories with j,m = 1.

4.1 a non-standard klein bottle

in this section we include a non-standard klein bottle to our solution. let
l denote an arbitrary simple current. consider

k [l]

i = e2iql(i)ki

.

(31)

note that not every l is allowed. we have to require that 2ql(i) = 0 mod 1
when ki 6= 0, otherwise the klein bottle coecient is not real. recall [2] that

10

the charge of a eld with respect to any simple current is (half-)integer when
the eld is self-conjugate. so the klein bottle coecient of a charge-zero eld
i0 and a xed point f is a sign for any l, since these elds only appear in the
direct klein bottle when they are self-conjugate. from the torus (21), we see
that charge-one-half elds i1 propagate in the direct klein bottle when they
satisfy i1 = jic
1, which implies, by charge conservation, ql(j) = 2ql(i1). we
conclude that equation (31) is a consistent klein bottle if ql(j) = 0 mod 1.
note that there is at least one l that satises this requirement, namely
l = j. let us focus on this case. then equation (31) becomes

k [j]

i =

1
2

[yi00 + yij j  2j,myi0j ]

.

the crosscap coecient is

[j]
b =

1
2

[pb0  j,mpbj ]

sb0

.

(32)

(33)

as an ansatz for the boundary coecients, we take equations (22) and (23)
and replace sb0 by sbj as in [10]. the annulus and mobius coecients
that change relative to the standard klein bottle projection are

a[j]

m [j]

if g =
1
2

if  =

1
[nif g  nif g]
2
[yf 0i  j,myf j i]

, a[j]

if g =

1
2

[nif g + nif g]

,

.

(34)

(35)

miraculously, the positivity and integrality condition in the open sector for
xed point boundary indices now becomes

1
2|yf 0i  j,myf j i| 
1
[yf 0i  j,myf j i] =
2

1
2
1
2

,

[nif f  nif f ]
[nif f  nif f ] mod 2 ,

(36)

(37)

which we prove in appendix a.

4.2 the matrix s
in wzw-models the matrix s is the modular transformation matrix of the
orbit lie algebra, and it diers by a known phase from the xed point reso-
lution matrix sj . the xed point resolution matrices are explicitly known

11

for wzw-models [15] and extended wzw models [16]. the generalization
of s beyond wzw-models is not straightforward, since orbit lie algebras are
related to foldings of dynking diagrams, a concept that has no obvious cft
generalization. one could try to dene s as the transformation matrix of the
twining characters (as dened in [17]), but their denition does not straight-
forwardly generalize either. even if such a generalization is possible, we do
not know if the twining characters are always well-behaved under modular
transformations, nor the relation between s and sj. we will postulate here
that s exists and that it is related to sj in a similar way as in wzw-models.
thus we take as the denition of s

s = e6i m

24 sj .

(38)

for (half)-integer spin currents of wzw-models the number m (which is
dened modulo 24 and is related to a phase-shift in the matrix t ) is known,
and it is an even (odd) integer for integer (half-integer) spin currents. this
is what we will assume in general. note that for half-integer spin currents
there are twelve possible values for m, resulting in four possible phases in the
denition of s. without further information s is then known up to a factor
1 or i. in our case a sign change is irrelevant, since this only determines
the choice between f + and f . a change by a factor i changes the sign
of j,m and n. these sign changes can be ipped by choosing the opposite
klein bottle projection, as explained above, so that nally there is no genuine
ambiguity left. this denition of s appears to be adequate in all cases with
the possible exception of the klein bottle constraint violations mentioned in
the next subsection.

4.3 the klein bottle constraint

in this section we discuss the klein bottle constraint for open descendants of
order 2 automorphism invariants. this condition reads

n k
ij kikjkk  0 ,
where the klein bottle for the various elds is

(39)

ki0 = yi000

, ki1 = m,j yi10j

, kf = m,j yf 0j = f yf 00

,

(40)

where in the last step (63) was used.

12

since the charges with respect to any simple current are conserved (mod
1) in fusion, there are four sectors where the fusion coecients are non-zero.
we will discuss the klein bottle constraint in these sectors one by one.

 the coupling between three charge-zero elds.

since the klein bottle in this sector is just the frobenius-schur indicator
(in the original theory), the klein bottle constraint is satised trivially.

 the coupling between a charge-zero eld and two xed points.
from equation (40) we nd that the klein bottle coecient for a xed
point is equal to its frobenius-schur indicator times a sign, f . if f
does not depend on f the klein bottle constraint is satised (assuming
it holds in the c-diagonal case). in case when two self-conjugate xed
points f and g with f 6= g have a nonzero coupling with a charge-zero
eld i0, the klein bottle constraint is violated! we will comment on
this below.

for the remaining two cases we make use of the extended tensor product
method of appendix a. we tensor the theory under consideration with a
second one, also with a half-integer spin current, and extend the chiral algebra
by the product of the half-integer spin currents of the two theories.
it is
convenient to tensor with a series of theories , namely so(2n + 1) level 1.
in these theories y f 0 j = (1)n y f 00  n , which is a sign. then we derive
from equations (52), (53) and (54)

yie0e0e = yi000
yje0e0e = n [yj100 + (1)n j yj10j ]
yfe,0e0e =

(41)
(42)
n kf [f + j (1)n j,m] (43)

1
2

1
2

n [yf 00 + (1)n j yf 0j ] =
2 ]. furthermore we have

where j = ei[hj + 1

n ke

ieje = n k1

i0j1 + n k1

j i0,j1

, n fe,

ieje = n f

i0j1

(44)

now we use the klein bottle constraint in the extended tensor product theory
to deal with the last two cases.

13

 the coupling between a charge-zero eld and two charge-one-

half elds.

we wish to prove

n k1
i0j1 ki0kj1kk1  0 .

(45)

from the torus (21), we know that a charge-one-half eld j1 propagates
in the direct klein bottle when jc
1 = jj1. so these elds must be
complex, i.e., have a vanishing frobenius-schur indicator yj100. from
equations (42) and (40), we see that the klein bottle coecient for
these elds becomes kj1 = (1)n j,mn j yje0e0e. however, the signs
are irrelevant, since they do not depend on j1 and cancel between the
two charge-one-half elds. then the klein bottle constraint follows
from the (proposed) conservation of frobenius-schur indicators in the
extended tensor theory

n ke
ieje yie0e0eyje0e0eyke0e0e  0

(46)

and the fact that n ke

ieje  n k1

i0j1 , as a consequence of equation (44).

 the coupling between a charge-zero eld, a charge-one-half

eld and a xed point.

we can always choose n in (43) such that the two terms do not cancel.
for that choice of n we have then kf = (1)n j,mn j yfe,0e0e, exactly
the relation we found in the previous case. then the xed point behaves
like an ordinary charge-one-half eld, and the rest of the argument is
completely analogous to the previous case.

4.4 violations of the klein bottle constraint

the violation of the klein bottle constraint noted above may be resolved
in several ways. first of all it is possible that either such models must
be rejected, or that there is something wrong with the general formalism
developed here. in the examples where the violation occurs we always have
to use the conjectured relation (38) to compute s. this may cast some
suspicion on this conjecture. however, there is a more interesting possibility.
the violation is due to dierent signs f in the relation s2
f g = f cf g. this
splits the set of xed points into two sets, one with f = 1 and one with

14

f = 1. conjugation closes on each set. it is easy to show that sf g must
have vanishing matrix elements between elds of dierent sets. this then
implies that nif g = 0. this immediately implies that nif g must be even,
since the average of both coecients must be an integer [7]. this may point
towards a possible solution of the puzzle.

it is instructive to consider the postulate of section 3 regarding conserva-
tion of the frobenius-schur indicator in fusion. the fs-indicator is the gen-
eralization to cft of the notion of real (r, fs=1), pseudo-real (p, fs=1)
or complex representations (c, fs=0) [13]. this property is preserved in
simple lie-algebra tensor products: schematically r  r = r, p  p = r
and p  r = p , where on the left-hand side we consider two irreducible
representations and on the right-hand side we have a direct sum of irre-
ducible representations, which may consist out of complex conjugate pairs.
strictly speaking the latter already violate fs-conservation, but since their
indicator is 0 such a violation does not aect the klein bottle constraint.
by analogy with fs-indicator of simple lie-algebra representations, we ex-
pect the fs-indicator to be preserved in fusion unless the fusion produces a
pair of complex conjugate representations (which together can form a real or
pseudo-real representation) or an even number of real or pseudo-real repre-
sentations. the latter possibilities are logically possible (for example for two
pseudo-real representations one can choose a real basis), but they never occur
in wzw-fusion or simple lie-algebra tensor products because there always
exists a conserved simple current charge which is 0 on real representations,
1/2 on pseudo-real ones and anything on complex representations. the con-
servation of this charge then enforces conservation of the fs-indicator in the
sense described above. however, in general cfts we may expect violations
of the conservation rule, leading to a violation of the klein bottle constraint
(4) by negative, even integers. we do not know of any cft where such a
violation occurs for the fs-indicators (i.e.
for the klein bottles of the c-
diagonal models), but remarkably we nd precisely such a violation for the
klein bottles of certain o-diagonal models.

this leads one to suspect that perhaps violations by even negative integers
are allowed. consider for example two elds with klein bottle coecients
k1 = k2 = 1 and a third with k3 = 1. the existence of a closed string
coupling of the rst two elds to the third implies a coupling of two symmet-
rically projected unoriented string elds to the symmetric projection of the
third one. but if k3 = 1 the symmetric projection is an unphysical state,

15

since the klein bottle produces an anti-symmetric projection. however, if
the coupling has multiplicity two (or even) it is possible for elds 1 and 2
to couple to a symmetric combination of two anti-symmetrically projected
(hence physical) states 3. this is precisely the reason why a violation of
fs-conservation was argued to be possible in principle, and is presumably
how these klein bottle constraint violations should be interpreted as well. if
this interpretation is correct there is no inconsistency, and the formulation
of the klein bottle constraint must be weakened as explained above.

5 conclusions and outlook

in this paper we have presented natural and general candidates for crosscap
coecients belonging to theories with a non-trivial automorphism invariants
in the bulk. although we do not pretend to have proved that the resulting
open string theories are fully consistent, at least we have demonstrated that
our solution passes a number of non-trivial checks. in rare cases there may
be a problem with the klein bottle constraint, but we have argued that the
fact that the violation is always by even integers may provide a way out of
the problem, and that perhaps a slightly weaker form of the constraint might
be acceptable.

the crosscap coecients are an essential ingredient in the tadpole cancel-
lation conditions, which can now be studied for open descendants of a much
larger class of bulk theories.

nevertheless there are still several classes of automorphism invariants for
which the crosscap coecients remain unknown. obvious extensions of our
results can be made to automorphisms generated by z2n simple currents
and to non-cyclic simple current groups. one may in fact hope for one
general formula covering all cases. we expect to address this question in the
near future. another interesting direction is the study of diagonal invariants
(i.e. a charge conjugation invariant of a c-diagonal theory) and exceptional
invariants such as the e7 invariant of su(2) level 16. furthermore the
entire formalism should be extended to the case of boundaries that break
bulk symmetries.

a inequalities from tensoring

in this appendix we obtain some useful relations among the quantities n, n
and y , which are needed for proving integrality, positivity and the klein
bottle constraint.

the strategy is as follows. we will show that the klein bottle coecient
of section 4 can be related to the frobenius-schur indicator of a dierent
theory. the conservation of this indicator will translate into the klein bottle
constraint. similarly, equation (12), which holds in this theory, turns out to
prove positivity and integrality in the open sector.

more explicitly, we tensor the theory of interest with another theory that
contains a half-integer spin simple current. we then extend the chiral alge-
bra of this tensor theory with the products of the half-integer spin simple
currents. we label the elds in the tensor product by it = (i,i) and the elds
in the extended tensor product by ie. in particular, jt = (j, j) is a simple
current and when f is a xed point of j and f a xed point of j , ft = (f, f )
is a xed point of jt.

the matrices s, t and p and the coecients nijk and yijk of the tensor
theory are related to those of its components in a straightforward way. to
deal with the extension we make use of the results of [15] to resolve the
xed points of jt. this then gives us the matrix s of the extended theory
in terms of the matrices s and sj (the xed point resolution matrix) of the
components. we then compute p , n and y .

in the extended theory only elds it = (i,i) that are chargeless under jt
exist, so qj (i) = q j (i). furthermore, these elds are grouped by the action
of the simple current jt. for every xed point in the tensor theory there are
two elds in the extension [2], which we label by ,  = (1, 2).

the matrices s, t and p of this extension are related to those of the
unextended theory, which is the tensor theory. for the matrix s we have for
instance

sieje = 2sitjt

, siefe, = sitft

.

when the indices are two xed points the result is

sfe,ge, = sftgte + sj

ftgtf

,

(47)

(48)

17

where the matrices e and f are given by

e =   1 1

1 1 ! ,

f =   1 1

1 ! .

1

(49)

the matrix p in the extension, is given by

pieje = 2 pitjt

, pfe,je = pftjt

, pfe,ge, = 0 .

(50)

where the orbit averaged p -matrix is (x = it, ft)

pxjt =

1

2 "pxjt +s tjtjt

tj jt,j jt

pxj jt#

.

(51)

we can now relate the tensor y of the extended theory to the tensors y of
the components of the tensor product. we will be particularly interested in
the frobenius-schur indicators of ie = (i0, 0) + (ji0, j), je = (j1, f) + (jj1, f )
and fe = (f, f ). the subscripts 0 and 1 were introduced in section 4, and
refer to the charges of the elds. a straightforward calculation shows

yie0e0e = yi000y000 + j, j yi00j y00 j = yi000
yje0e0e = yj100y f 00 + j, j yj10j y f 0 j

,

,

yfe,0e0e =

1
2

[yf 00y f00 + j, j yf 0j y f 0 j ]

,

(52)
(53)

(54)

where j, j = ei[hj +h j ] = 1. in the rst line we used |y00 j|  n j
00 = 0
(see equation (12)). the fusion coecients in the extended theory can also
be related to those of the components of the tensor theory. we have for
example:

n ke
n fe,

ieje = n k1
= n f
i0j1n

i0j1 n

ieje

f
0 f + n k1
f
0 f

,

j i0j1n

f
j f

,

(55)

(56)

where ke = (k1, f) + (jk1, f ).

one can also show that

yfe,0eie =

1
2

[yf 0i0y f00 + j, j yf j i0y f j0]

(57)

18

and

where

niefe,ge, =

1
2

[ni0f gn0 f g + e 1

2 i(m+ m) ni0f g n0 f g]

,

nif g = xh,j h=h

shi shf shg

sh0

,

n0f g = f cf g

,

(58)

(59)

where f is a sign. the phase factor in (58) is due to the fact that we have
expressed the xed point resolution matrices sj (which appear naturally in
xed point resolutions for integer spin currents) in terms of s using (38). in
the tensor theory mt is an even integer, which decomposes as mt = m + m,
where m and m are odd.

in wzw-models this sign is in fact independent of f , but in extended
in the extended

wzw-models examples are known where it is not [16].3
tensor theory, equation (12) must hold. so for instance

|yfe,0eie|  niefe,fe,

.

(60)

we now make a specic choice for the bar-theory, namely the ising model
with elds 0 = 0, f =  and j = . equation (60) then becomes

1
2|yf 0i0  j,myf j i0| 

1
2

[ni0f f  ni0f f ]

,

(61)

where j,m is dened in the main text. note that the above equations are
the positivity conditions in the open sector where the boundary labels are
xed points for the two klein bottle projections of section 4. integrality can
be proved in a similar way. it is not hard to convince oneself that the above
bound is independent of the chosen bar-theory. another consequence of
this inequality can be seen by taking i = 0. with the use of equation (59)
we get

1
2|yf 00  j,myf j0| 

1
2

cf f  f cf f

.

note that this implies

yf 00 = f m,j yf 0j

.

(62)

(63)

3note that  is dened here in terms of the square of s, not the square of sj as in [15].

if (38) holds, f = 1.
