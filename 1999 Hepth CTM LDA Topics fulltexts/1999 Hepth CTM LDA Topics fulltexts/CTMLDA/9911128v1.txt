abstract

we develop in a systematic fashion the idea of gauging 1d-space trans-
lations with xed newtonian time for nonrelativistic matter (particles and
elds). by starting with a nonrelativistic free theory we obtain its minimal
gauge invariant extension by introducing two gauge elds with a maxwellian
self interaction. we x the gauge so that the residual symmetry group is the
galilei group and construct a representation of the extended galilei algebra.
the reduced n -particle lagrangian describes geodesic motion in a (n  1)-
dimensional (pseudo-) riemannian space. the singularity of the metric for
negative gauge coupling leads in classical dynamics to the formation of geo-
metric bags in the case of two or three particles. the ordering problem within
the quantization scheme for n -particles is solved by canonical quantization
of a pseudoclassical schrodinger theory obtained by adding to the continuum
generalization of the point-particle lagrangian an appropriate quantum cor-
rection. we solve the two-particle bound state problem for both signs of the
gauge coupling. at the end we speculate on the possible physical relevance of
the new interaction induced by the gauge elds.

1 introduction

gauging a symmetry may be called the leading principle for the construction of

fundamental interactions in physics (cp. [1]).

not only internal symmetry groups are gauged (u(1) in qed, su(n) in qcd)

but space time symmetries are gauged too (poincare group in general relativity).

but the gauge principle not only determines a vast amount of relativistic physics

as elementary or gravitational physics, it is also of importance in condensed matter

physics (description of the fractional quantum hall eect by an abelian gauge eld

with a chern-simons term minimally coupled to charged matter). therefore we may

ask the question of the importance of the gauge principle in nonrelativistic physics

quite generally. what about gauging the galilei group? in recent work by de pietri

et al. [2] this task has been taken up for a single point particle and extended systems

in (3 + 1)-dimensions. but the authors of [2] started with the nonrelativistic limit

of general relativity and threw away all elds not coupled to matter in this limit. in

this respect our work will be completely dierent from [2]. our leading principles

are:

i) we begin with a nonrelativistic free theory of matter which is invariant with

respect to global galilei transformations,

ii) we ask for the smallest number of gauge elds with a minimal coupling la-

grangian leading to a gauge invariant theory.

in contrast to [2] the main aim of our gauging procedure is the determination of

the interaction between the constitutents of matter (point particles or elds) induced

by the gauge elds.

in a recent letter [3] we started to work out this idea with the simplest example:

classical point particles moving on a line or on a circle. the underlying global

transformations are 1d-space translations whose gauging leads to general coordinate

transformations at xed newtonian time. the minimal coupling lagrangian for

this example contains only two gauge elds with a maxwellian interaction term. in

particular we dont introduce an additional dilaton eld as in (1 + 1)-gravity [4].

2

the arbitrary gauge function in the solution for the gauge eld has been chosen

such, that the galilei group appears as the residual symmetry group. in the present

paper we will give a full account of [3] for point particles on the line, extend the

work to the case of elds and treat the quantization of particles and elds.

our paper is organized as follows: in section 2 we review the point particle case

from [3] and give a continuum generalization in terms of hydrodynamic eld vari-

ables. in addition we discuss the local conservation law following from noethers

theorem. section 3 is devoted to a full discussion of the gauge xing problem with

galilei symmetry as the resulting residual symmetry.

in section 4a we give the

reduction of our lagrangian to matter variables by using the symplectic hamilto-

nian procedure and discuss the resulting n-particle dynamics as geodesic motion
in a (n  1)dimensional (pseudo-) riemannian space. the representation of the
extended galilei algebra with the total mass as central charge is treated in section

4b. we continue the discussion of classical physics with the string-like behaviour

of the two-particle system in section 4c. in particular we obtain a dynamically de-

termined geometric bag model for two or three particles in the case of a negative

gauge coupling (section 4d). after a discussion of the ordering problem within the

quantization scheme for point particles in section 5a we enlarge our hydrodynamic

eld theory to a pseudo-classical schrodinger theory by adding a quantum correc-

tion term (section 5b). the canonical quantization of this schrodinger theory will

be treated in section 5c. in this way we give a solution of the ordering problem for

the n-particle hamilton operator. section 6 gives an analytic solution for the two-

particle bound state problem for both signs of the gauge coupling. finally, section

7 contains some nal remarks including an outlook on subsequent work.

2 minimal-coupling lagrangian

a) point particles

we start with n nonrelativistic particles in free motion on a line (r1) described by
the lagrangian1

l0 =

1
2

( x(t))2

n

x=1

the equations of motion (eom) following from (2.1)

are invariant with respect to global galilei-transformations

x = 0

with

and

(x, t)  (x, t)

x = x + a + vt

t = t + b

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

where the parameters a, v and b take values in r1. now we generalize (2.4) to a

local transformation, given in innitesimal form by

x = a(x, t)

(2.6)

where a(x, t) is an arbitrary, twice dierentiable and bounded function of its argu-

ments. eq. (2.6) describes local space translations (including local boosts). we

keep time translations with a constant b (cp. (2.5)).

obviously the eom (2.2) are not invariant with respect to the transformation

(2.6). in order to repair that, we introduce two gauge elds h(x, t) and e(x, t) and
replace x for each particle in (2.1) by the function2 

 = h(x, t) x + e(x, t).

(2.7)

1for reasons of simplicity we give all particles the same mass m = 1 in appropriate units.
2our procedure diers from the corresponding one in [2] applied to one space dimension. in [2]
l0 would be replaced by a polynomial of second order in x requiring three gauge elds instead of
two.

4

invariance of  with respect to (2.6) requires the following transformation rules for

the gauge elds

where

h = hxa , e = hta

f (x, t) := f (x + x, t + t).

(2.8)

(2.9)

with (2.7) we supply the minimal gauge invariant extension for the particle velocities

x.

in agreement with (1 + 1)-gravity (cp.

}) = (1, 0) and {e1

[5]) we conclude from (2.7) and (2.8)
} with
} is trivial

that our gauge elds e(x, t) and h(x, t) are components of the zweibein {eb
components {e0
because time has been held xed up to translations with a constant.

} = (e, h). in our case the vector {e0

now l0 in (2.1) has to be replaced by

with

where we dened

lmatter =

1
2

n

x=1

((t))2

(t) := h(t) x(t) + e(t)

f(t) := f (x(t), t)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

for an arbitrary eld f (x, t).

we must supplement (2.10) by an invariant (or quasi-invariant) lagrangian leld

describing the self-interaction of the gauge elds. let us dene a eld strength f

f :=

1
h

(th  xe)

(2.13)

from (2.9) we obtain easily the commutator between  and any partial dieren-

tiation   (t, x)

f = f  (a)xf .

(2.14)

we infer from (2.8) and (2.14) that our eld strength f is gauge invariant

f = 0 .

5

(2.15)

therefore, any integral of the form

with the invariant measure

zr1

dt(x)k(f (x, t))

dt(x) := h(x, t)dx

(2.16)

(2.17)

is a candidate for leld. the simplest, nontrivial example for k is a quadratic

k(z) = z 2

with this maxwellian choice for leld our action takes the form

s = z dt(lmatter + leld)

(2.18)

(2.19)

with

2 z dxh(x, t)f 2(x, t)
where  is a coupling strength. with our zweibein {eb
} we identify hf as the
only nonvanishing component of the torsion tensor and (2.20) as the related local

leld =

(2.20)

1

quadratic lagrangian (cp. [7]).

by varying s with respect to x we get the particle-eom

 + f = 0 .

(2.21)

for the following it is advantageous to replace the lagrangian (2.10) by its 1st-order

form

lmatter = x

(h x + e) 

1

2 x

2


(2.22)

variation of s with respect to  leads to (2.11) now as a constraint rather than a

denition.

b) fields

the continuum generalisation of the lagrangian (2.22) will be given in analogy to

the case of free particles [6] in terms of hydrodynamics variables (x, t) and (x, t)

6

describing a density eld and a potential eld respectively. therefore we look for a
lagrangian lmatter such that for the particular choice3

and the identication

(x, t) =

1

h(x, t) x

(x  x(t))

(x, t) :=

1

h(x, t)

x(x, t)

we obtain up to a total time-derivative the expression (2.22).

it can easily be shown that the desired expression for lmatter is given by

lmatter = z dt(x)(x, t)(dt)(x, t)
2 z dt(x)(x, t)(d)2(x, t)



1

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

where the invariant derivatives d and dt are dened by means of the inverse
zweibein { e
b }

d := e1

1x =

1

h(x, t)

x

and

dt

:= e

0  = t  e(x, t)d

(2.26)

(2.27)

under the proviso that our hydrodynamic eld e and  are invariant with respect

to local coordinate transformations (2.6)

the invariance of lmatter

follows.

 =  = 0

lmatter = 0

(2.28)

(2.29)

this invariance leads by means of noethers 2nd theorem to a local conservation law

t(x) + x(jd 

1
2

f 2) = 0

where the current j is dened by

(2.30)

(2.31)

3the factor 1/h in front of the r.h.s. of (2.23) arises from the fact that (x, t) is a density with

j := (d  e) .

respect to the measure dt(x).

7

as for any gauge theory the local conservation law (2.30) is nothing but a combina-

tion of the eom for gauge elds and denes a superpotential (cp. [8]):

by varying our action with respect to h and e respectively we obtain

and

tf = jd 

1
2

f 2

xf = x .

(2.32)

(2.33)

in order that the boundary term in the derivation of (2.33) vanishes we assumed that

e and h are nite at spatial innity and f vanishes there. the latter requirement

leads due to (2.33) to the constraint

z dxx = 0 .

(2.34)

by inserting (2.32-33) the local conservation law (2.30) is satised identically.

it

follows that the superpotential is proportional to the eld strength f as in electro-

dynamics. but the corresponding charge vanishes in our case.

furthermore due to the invariance of lmatter with respect to the transformation

we obtain the continuity equation

   + const.

t(h) + xj = 0 .

3 gauge xing

(2.35)

(2.36)

in this section we will show, that the gauge eld h(x, t) is not a dynamical variable

but a kinematical entity to be determined by xing the class of physically admissible

frames of reference.

let us start with introducing a gauge function  by

h(x, t) = x(x, t)

(3.1)

with the local transformation properties (2.8) and (2.14) we infer from (3.1)

8

i) the most general form of e(x, t) is given by

e(x, t) = t(x, t) + e(x, t)

(3.2)

with e = 0 (but in general e depends on !)

ii)  = 0, or for nite transformations generated by a(x, t)

(x, t) = ea(x,t)x (x, t)

(3.3)

physically admissible frames of reference in the nonrelativistic regime are inertial

frames connected to each other by galilei transformations. therefore we have to x
a class of functions {(x, t)} such that the remaining (residual) symmetry group is
the galilei group only. this means we must look for {} invariant with respect to
transformations generated by

only. this is the case i

a(x, t) =  + t

(x, t) = x  (a + vt)

which is equivalent to xing the gauge by

and demanding

h(x, t) = 1

e =  .

(3.4)

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

it remains to show that for an arbitrary function (x, t) with x 6= 0 it is always
possible to nd a transformation

such that (x, t) is given by (3.5). obviously this goal will be achieved with

x  x(x, t)

x(x, t) = (x, t) + (a + vt)

since (3.3) may be written as

(3.8)

(3.9)

(x, t) = (x, t) .

(3.10)

4 classical dynamics

a) reduced matter lagrangian

in order to express our lagrangian l in terms of matter variables only, we will follow

the symplectic hamiltonian procedure of faddeev and jackiw [9].

we enlarge our phase space by an additional eld (x, t) and obtain for the

canonical 1st order form of l

l = z dx(t  h(x, t))

with (after a partial integration)

h(x, t) : =

2


2

1
(x)2 +
2
e(x + x) .

(4.1)

(4.2)

in (4.2) e(x, t) is a lagrange-multiplier eld. variation of s with respect to e

leads to the constraint

which has the solution

x = x

(x, t) = 

1

2 z dy(x  y)(y, t)y(y, t)

(4.3)

(4.4)

where (x) := x/|x|.

in order that the boundary term arising in the derivation of (4.1-2) vanishes and

to obtain | r dx2 |<  we have to require a boundary condition at spatial innity:

from (4.4) we conclude that (4.5) implies the constraint (cp. (2.34))

 |x== 0 .

z dx(x, t)x(x, t) = 0

(4.5)

(4.6)

i.e. the total canonical momentum of matter has to vanish.

the constraint (4.6) eq. cant be solved explicitly in terms of dynamical variables.

therefore we have to take into account (4.6) by means of a lagrange multiplier v.

10

with that and the insertion of (4.4) into (4.2) we obtain for the reduced matter

lagrangian lred

with

lred = z dx(t  hred(x, t)

hred(x, t) :=

1
2

(x)2 +


2

2 + vx

(4.7)

(4.8)

where (x, t) is given by (4.4).

by varying lred with respect to  and  we obtain the hydrodynamic eom

t = 

1
2

(x)2 + ex

(4.9)

and the continuity equation (2.36) respectively where the gauge eld e(x, t) is given

in terms of (x, t) as follows

e(x, t) = v 



2 z dy(x  y)(y, t) .

using (4.4) and (4.6) e(x, t) may be rewritten as

e(x, t) = v +



2 z dy|x  y|(y, t)y(y, t) .

(4.10)

(4.11)

the lagrange multiplier v will not be determined from the eom. in accordance

with section 3 we choose v as constant, i.e. time independent.

comparison of the eoms derived from lred with the correponding poisson-
bracket (pb) relations a = {a, hred} for any eld a leads to the symplectic structure
(4.12)

{(x, t), (y, t)} = (x  y)

with all other pbs vanishing.

we note that lred is invariant with respect to time translation too. therefore

our residual symmetry is given by the full galilei group.

by means of (2.23-24) we may specialize (4.7) to the case of n point particles.

we obtain after a partial integration and use of (4.6) up to a total time derivative

lred = x

( x 

1

  v) +



4 x, |x|

(4.13)

11

where x := x  x.
from (4.6) we read o the constraint

n

x=1

a = 0

(4.14)

which may be solved for 1 leading to (using the summation convention, indices

running from 2 to n)

with

(|| + ||  |  |)

(4.15)

(4.16)

(4.17)

l

red is now independent of v. galilei symmetry becomes a hidden symmetry.

we observe that h
red looks like a free hamiltonian describing the geodesic motion of
one-particle in a (n  1)-dimensional (pseudo-) riemannian space m with metric
{g} (obtained as the inverse of (4.17)).

red with respect to  we obtain the constraint

by varying the action s = r dtl

 = g() .

(4.18)

if we express l

red and h

red by means of (4.18) in terms of ({},{ }) we obtain
(4.19)

g()  

l
red = h

red =

2

therefore the euler-lagrange equations become the geodesic equations in standard

form

   = 0

(4.20)

where the

g((g) + (g)  (g)) .

12

on the other hand the variations of s with respect to  leads to the eom

 = 

1
2

(g) .

(4.21)

it is self-evident that the combination of (4.18) and (4.21) leads back to (4.20).

writing (4.18) and (4.21) in pb-form we infer from (4.16) the canonical sym-

plectic structure

{, } = 
 ,

{, } = {, } = 0

(4.22)

b) representation of the extended galilei algebra

we have pointed out in section 3 that with the choosen gauge (3.6-7) the residual

symmetry group is the galilei group.

in this section we will show that our classical theory described in section 4a

allows a representation of the extended galilei algebra with one central charge given

by the total mass of the system.

in order to have the correct physical insight into each step of the following

treatment we consider the case of n point particles rst. afterwards we generalize

the results for the case when we are dealing with elds.

it is well known that the appearance of a central charge is related to the quasi

invariance of the lagrangian with respect to the symmetry transformation consid-

ered. but our lred (eq. (4.13)) is invariant with respect to translations and boosts.

in order to change this situation for boosts we add to lred a total time derivative

(which leaves the eom unchanged)

d
dt

(vx

(x 

v
2

t))

and obtain the 1st order lagrangian

lred = x

x( + v) + vx

(x  vt)  hred

with

hred :=

1

2 x

(2

 + v2) + vx

 



4 x, |x| .

13

(4.23)

(4.24)

(4.25)

now lred is quasiinvariant with respect to innitesimal boosts x = t, v = 

lred = 

d

dt x

x .

(4.26)

from (4.24-25) we infer, that our extended phase space will be described by the set
of variables ({x},{p}, v, pv) where
 lred
 x
 lred
 v

(x  vt) .

(4.28)

p :=

=  + v

(4.27)

pv :=

= x

we remark that (4.28) is a constraint reducing the degrees of freedom in phase space,

but for the following it is necessary to stay in extended phase space.

we dene the total canonical momentum p by

and observe that it has the correct physical behaviour with respect to boosts

p := x

p

p = n .

hred expressed in terms of phase space variables reads

hred =

1

2 x

p2
 



4 x, |x|(p  v)(p  v) .

from (4.29) and (4.31) we obtain

{p, hred} = 0 .

(4.29)

(4.30)

(4.31)

(4.32)

by using the canonical symplectic structure for our phase space variables it is easily

seen that the conserved boost generator k leading to the desired pb-relations

and

{k, p} = n

{k, hred} = p

14

(4.33)

(4.34)

is given by

the r.h.s. of (4.33) describes the total mass of the n-particle system in units of

k = x

x  pv  tp .

(4.35)

m = 1. therefore the equations (4.32-34) constitute a representation of the extended

galilei algebra with one central charge.

according to (2.23-24)h=1 the generalization of the foregoing results to the case

of elds is obtained by means of the following substitutions

i) add to lred (eq. (4.7)) the expression

d

dt z dx( + vx 

v2
2

t)

ii) dene total momentum p and boost generator k respectively by

and

p := z dx(x + v)

k := z dxx  pv  tp .

c) string-like behaviour

in the point particle case the -eld (eq. (4.4) takes the form

(x, t) = 

1
2

n

x=1

(x  x(t))(t)

(4.36)

with the constraint (4.14). therefore (x, t) vanishes outside a closed x-intervall

(x, t) = 0

x / [1(t), 2(t)]

(4.37)

with  1

2

(t) := min

max{x}.

in particular for n = 2 (x, t) is string-like with point masses at its ends.

from (4.17,20) we obtain the following eom for relative particle motion (x :=

x1  x2)

x  e(x) = 0

15

(4.38)

where the conserved energy e is given by

e :=

1
4

x2
1 + 
2|x|

(4.39)

we conclude

i) for e > 0 but  < 0 the string is always of nite length (bounded motion)

ii) the interparticle potential is proportional to their distance with strength propor-

tional to the energy. this leads according to (4.38-39) to a constant positive

(negative) acceleration for x > 0 (x < 0) for either sign of  (for  < 0 if
|x| > 2/|| only) resulting in arbitrary large velocities if time goes on. there-
fore the model is unphysical for  > 0 and for  < 0 if |x| > 2/||.

iii) for n = 2, m is a one-dimensional riemannian space and therefore at. this

allows by means of the transformation

x  y :=

(1 +


2|x|)1/2

4
||

(4.40)

the transition to a 1d-euclidean space e1

e1 = ( [4/,]
[0, 4/||]

for  > 0
for  < 0

on e1 we have the free eom

y = 0

(4.41)

where the nite end points of e1 are points of reection.

iv) for  < 0 the metric is singular at |x| = 2/||. the region |x| > 2/|| is

physically disconnected from the region |x| < 2/|| (energy conservation!)

d) geometric bags

let us consider the case of  < 0 for n-point particles in more detail.

in the

last section we discovered for n = 2 exclusively bounded motion within the region
|x| < 2/|| determined by the singularity of the metric at |x| = 2/||. this is a
geometric bag as a dynamical consequence of our gauge theory. what about n  3 ?

16

for n > 3 we are unable to make any statement at present. but in the following we

will show that for n = 3 a geometric bag arises again determined by the singularity

of the metric:

let us consider the energy e for relative motion (4.19). because of the symmetry

of e with respect to arbitrary permutations of the particle numbers 1, 2 and 3 it is

sucient for the following to consider the particular ordering

x1 < x2 < x3 .

(4.42)

then we obtain from (4.16) and (4.17) with the substitutions

i+1  i := ||i+1

and

i+1  i ,

i = 1, 2

e =

1

((2  2) 2
22d
2(1  1) 1 2)

1 + (2  1) 2

2 

with

where due to (4.42)

d := det(g) = 3  22 + 1(2  1)

0 < 1 < 2 .

from (4.44-45) we infer that

d  0

if

1 < 2  1 +

21  3
1  2

, 1 <

3
2

and d < 0 in the adjoining region.

therefore the two curves ci, i = 1, 2

c1 :

c2 :

21  3
1  2

2 = 1 +
2 = 1  0

with 0  1  3/2

(4.43)

(4.44)

(4.45)

(4.46)

form the boundary of a nite region b1 in the (1, 2)-plane with vanishing d on

c1 corresponding to the singularity of our metric.

17

from (4.46) we conclude that e is positive within b1

e >

1

22d(2  1)

((1  1) 1  (2  1) 2)2 > 0 .

(4.47)

but e becomes innite on c1 for generic values of 1,2. therefore at nite energy

particles cant reach the boundary c1: they are conned within b1.

if we complete the picture by considering in addition to (4.42) the other ve

possible orderings, we arrive at a nite region b dening a geometric bag for our

three particles.

5 quantization

a) the ordering problem

in quantizing the n-particle system described by the hamiltonian (4.16) and the

symplectic structure (4.22) we have according to the canonical quantization recipe

to substitute

and

  p(=

h
i




=:

h
i

)

{a, b} 

[a, b]

ih

(5.1)

(5.2)

where [a,b] is the commutator of the operators a and b which denote any pair from
the phase space set {2, . . . , n , p2, . . . , pn}. but (5.1) does not specify uniquely the
quantum analogon of the hamiltonian g(), because the space variables {i}
and the momentum variables {pi} become non-commuting operators. this is the
well known ordering problem. the only restriction we have is the requirement of

hermiticity for the hamilton operator. but this leaves a whole family of admissible

hamilton operators for a given classical hamiltonian. let us illustrate this for the

simplest case, n = 2. from (4.16) we have

hclass = (1 +


2|x|)2

(5.3)

from that we obtain two fundamental hermitian hamilton operators (with respect

to the usual inner product)

h0 = p(1 +


2|x|)p

18

(5.4)

h1 =

1
2

(p2(1 +


2|x|) + (1 +


2|x|)p2) .

(5.5)

the most general hermitian hamilton operator is given by a linear combination

h = h1 + (1  )h0 ,

  [0, 1] .

(5.6)

how do they dier from each other? consider the dierence h  h . by means
of heisenbergs commutation relations we obtain

h  h  = (  )

h2
2

(x) .

(5.7)

therefore the h dier in the strength of a contact potential. this term beeing

proportional to h2 is a quantum correction.

but what we want to quantize are not separate theories for dierent particle numbers

n but a appropriate eld theory with a particle interpretation after quantization.

this quantum eld theory should lead to a n-particle amplitude with a denite
ordering prescription for the quantum analogon of g(y). for this the hydro-

dynamic eld theory described in section 4a is not a suitable starting point. it lacks

a particle interpretation after quantization.

b) the pseudo-classical schrodinger eld

in order to obtain a particle interpretation after quantization we have to start with

a classical complex-valued eld (x, t).

we know of only one complex-valued eld which after quantization possesses a

particle interpretation in nonrelativistic physics: the schrodinger eld (x, t).

with the madelung representation [10]

(x, t) = q(x, t)e

i

h (x,t)

(5.8)

our hydrodynamic eld theory (section 4a)) becomes a schrodinger eld theory by
adding to the lagrangian density in (4.7) a quantum correction term 0(h2)

h2

8(x, t)



(x(x, t))2

19

(5.9)

the resulting lagrangian lred may be expressed in terms of  and  as follows

with

where

and

lred = z dx"ih

2

(t  (t))  hred#

(5.10)

hred(x, t) :=

h2
2 |x|2 +


2

2(x, t) + vj(x, t)

(5.11)

j(x, t) := 

ih
2

(x  (x))

(x, t) := 

1

2 z dy(x  y)j(y, t)

(5.12)

(5.13)

(x, t) has to be understood as a classical eld  because of the appearance of h in

(5.10) we call it pseudo-classical.

by varying the action s with respect to  we obtain the following nonlinear, non-

local schrodinger equation for (x, t)

ih(t  e(x, t)x 

1
2

(xe(x, t)))(x, t) = 

h2
2

2
x(x, t)

where in analogy to (4.11) we have

e(x, t) := v +



2 z dy|x  y|j(y, t) .

(5.14)

(5.15)

on the other hand the variation of s with respect to v leads to the constraint

symplectic hamiltonian analysis leads to the pb

z dyj(y, t) = 0 .

ih{(x, t), (y, t)} = (x  y)

with all other pbs vanishing.

(5.16)

(5.17)

20

c) quantization and the n -particle amplitude

the quantization of the schrodinger equation (5.14) is obtained by means of the

following canonical recipe:

i) substitute

for the pb (5.17). all other commutators vanish.

h(x, t), (y, t)i = (x  y)

(5.18)

ii) keep all operator products in wick-ordered form (i.e.

shift all annihilation

operators  to the right)

iii) consider the constraint (5.16) as a subsidary condition for the physical hilbert

space g

z dyj(y, t) = 0

  g

(5.19)

i.e.  has vanishing total particle-momentum.

the n-particle wave function is dened as usual by

n (x1, . . . , xn , t) :=

1
n

< 0|(x1, t) . . . (xn , t)|n > .

(5.20)

the subsidary condition (5.19) applied to |n > is then equivalent to

in = 0

n

xi=1

(5.21)

i.e. n is only a function of the relative coordinates. this agrees with the classical

situation described by (4.15-17).

finally by means of (5.14), (5.18) and (5.21) we obtain the following schrodinger

equation for n as a function of relative coordinates {i}n
4 x
 n .

g() 
(  )
4 x<

ihtn =  

h2
2
h2



h2

i=2

()

(5.22)

21

this result corresponds to the following quantization rule for the classical n-particle

hamiltonian (4.16)

hclass =

g()

1
2


hquant = 

h2
8

(g() + g() +

+2g()) .

the agreement of (5.24) with (5.22) is easily seen by means of the relation

(g()) = 2(x

() + x<

(  )) .

(5.23)

(5.24)

(5.25)

therefore in the case of the two-particle problem we have to choose  = 1
2 for the
free parameter in (5.6). the quantization rule (5.23) = (5.24) is nothing but a
generalization of this  = 1/2 rule to a system of n identical particles.

now we want to express our hamiltonian operator as much as possible in terms of

entities which are invariant with respect to arbitrary coordinate transformations on

our (pseudo-) riemannian space m. this will be done by means of the following

steps:

i) dene n by n = g1/4n . then n is normalized with respect to the invariant

measure g d1 . . . dn 1

(g := det(g))

ii) decompose m into n!

regions specied by the signs of the xik. then the

-terms in (5.22) give the corresponding boundary conditions for n at the

border between these regions. on each of these regions our hamilton operator

takes the form

h = 

h2
2

 +

h2
8

r + v

where  is the invariant laplace-beltrami operator

 =

1
g

g()g .

22

(5.26)

(5.27)

r is the invariant scalar curvature (contraction of the ricci-tensor) and v is

an additional noninvariant quantum correction potential dened in terms of

cristoel symbols

v = 

h2
8


gv

 .

(5.28)

let us remark that the decomposition of the potential term in (5.26) into a

part proportional to r and a noninvariant residual v is not unique. we dened

this decomposition such, that v is as simple as possible and the factor in front

of r agrees with a choice supported recently by de witt [11].

6 two-particle bound states

in this section we consider the bound state solutions of the stationary schrodinger

equation (5.22) for n = 2

e2(x) = {h2x(1 +


2|x|)x 

h2
4

(x)}2(x) .

(6.1)

in this case m is the line which decomposes into the negative and positive half axis.
with bose-symmetry 2(x) = 2(x) we obtain from (6.1) on r1
equation

+ the dierential

with the boundary condition

e2 = hx(1 +


2

x)x2

(6.2)

(6.3)

x2(0) = 


8

2(0) .

the solutions of (6.2-3) may be smoothly continued to the negative real axis. then

the boundary condition (6.3) tells us, that the two particles obey fractional statistics

(cp. [12]).

let us now apply the procedure described in section 5.c:

m is at and therefore r = 0. the laplace-beltrami operator is given by

 = h2(1 +


2

x)1/2x(1 +


2

x)1/2x

(6.4)

23

and we obtain for v

v = 

h22
64

1
1 + 

2 x

.

(6.5)

the boundary condition for 2(x) := (2 + x)1/42 at x = 0 follows from (6.3) as

x2(0) = 0 .

(6.6)

because m is at we may again perform the transformation (4.40) to euclidean

space e1 as in the classical case. this transforms our schrodinger equation into its

normal form

with

and the boundary condition

e 2(y) = (h22

y + v (y)) 2(y)

v (y) = 

h2
4y2

y 2(4/||) = 0

(6.7)

(6.8)

(6.9)

(6.10)

(6.11)

the inner product has now to be taken with respect to the measure dy.

in contrast to the classical case we have a nonzero potential in (6.7) which is a

quantum correction. this term leads for scattering states to free particle behaviour

with generalized statistics (cp. [13]).

in order to proceed we have to treat the two cases  >

< 0 separately.

a)  > 0

the solution of (6.7) which vanishes for y   (e < 0) is given by

2(y) = y1/2k0 e

h

y!

with the boundary condition (eq. (6.9))

2sk1(s) = k0(s)

where s := 4
h

e and k0,1 are modied bessel functions of the third kind.

24

(6.11) has one xed point only at

s0 = 0, 16572

i.e. there exists one bound state only. this result corresponds to the well known

fact that the 1d-schrodinger equation with a single -potential has one bound state
only. as the coupling strength of the -potential in (6.1) is proportional to h2,

the appearance of this bound state is a quantum eect. in the classical case only

unbounded solutions with e > 0 are possible (cp. section 4.c).

b)  < 0

the requirement of niteness of 2(2/||) leads to

2(0) = 0

(6.12)

(6.7) on the nite intervall (0, 4/||),
we have to consider the schrodinger eq.
because the transformation (4.40) holds for x  i := (0, 2/||) only. from the
physical point of view the singularity of the metric at x = 2/|| means that no
events inside and outside of i are connected to each other. in addition we remark

that outside of i our h is not bounded from below and therefore unphysical.

the solutions of (6.7) respecting the boundary conditions are (e > 0)

2(y) = y1/2j0 e

h

y!

with the spectrum given by the innite number of xed points of

2sj1(s) = j0(s)

(6.13)

with s := 4
h()

e. we obtain

and

s0 = 0, 9407705640

sn = (n +

1
4

)

25

(6.14)

with

already for small values of n the n lie close to the asymptotic values (6.15). we

n

n n .

(6.15)

obtain

1 = 1, 010306991

...

9 = 9.001369775

etc.

(6.16)

this innite tower of bound states with e > 0 corresponds to the classical situation

which allows for bounded motion only (cp. eq. (4.39)). at the same time this tower

gives us the quantum picture for our strings of nite length with masses at their

end points (cp. section 4.c).

this result also presents us with a quantum picture for our geometric bag model.

7 conclusions and outlook

we have shown that the application of the gauge principle to 1d-space translations

for nonrelativistic point particles or elds leads to a nontrivial interaction with in-

teresting features in both classical and quantum dynamics. but to which interaction

known in nature corresponds this interaction? we dont know of any macroscopic

interaction between two particles with a potential proportional to their distance and

energy as in (4.38). for a gauge coupling  > 0 this interaction is unphysical any-

way because it leads to arbitrary large velocities if time goes on. the same holds for
 < 0 if the interparticle distance is larger then 2/||. on the other hand we have
shown in section 4.d that classically we obtain for  < 0 a geometric bag for two and

three particles respectively. this result has been quantum mechanically extended

for n = 2 in section 6. therefore we may speculate, that our new interaction is

of physical relevance for  < 0 in the microscopic regime in connection with the

connement problem. but such a speculative statement immediately leads to two

new and important questions:

26

i) what happens in higher space dimensions d = 2 or 3 ? will geometric bag

formation persist?

work for d = 2 with a chern-simons-like interaction for the gauge elds is in

progress. thereby we will also include the second central charge of the galilei

group in the free lagrangian (cp.

[14]). in this context we will also take up

the problem of particles and elds moving on a circle again.

ii) what is the connection with qcd? for that we have to extend our framework by

supplying our particles and elds respectively with a nonabelian color charge

and by gauging the corresponding su(n)-group simultaneously with the space

translations.

we will take up this very interesting question as soon as possible.
