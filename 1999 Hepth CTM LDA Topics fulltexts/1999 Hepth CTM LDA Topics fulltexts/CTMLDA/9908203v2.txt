abstract

polyakov has conjectured that yangmills theory should be equivalent to a
noncritical string theory.
i pointed out, based on the work of marchesini,
ishibashi, kawai and collaborators, and jevicki and rodrigues, that the loop
operator of the yangmills theory is the temporal gauge string eld theory
hamiltonian of a noncritical string theory.
in the present note i explicitly
show how this works for the oneplaquette model, providing a consistent
direct string interpretation of the unitary matrix model for the rst time.

the naturality of a string interpretation of yangmills theory was rst appreciated by man-
delstam [1], and has been elaborated upon with signicant insights by many others [2]. the
wilson loop observables of gauge theories satisfy dynamical schwingerdyson equations
that have precise geometric interpretations [3]. these loop equations simplify considerably
in the limit n   where n is the rank of the gauge group. this is also natural for the
string interpretation following t hoofts study of the large n limit of gauge theories, since
this is the limit when string loop contributions to amplitudes are suppressed. thus wilson
loop expectation values in the large n gauge theory satisfy classical equations. the loop
equation appears also as the saddlepoint equation in the collective eld theory setup of
jevicki and sakita [4].

strings do not interact in this limityet the loop equation has terms corresponding to
the splitting of strings, and terms that annihilate strings. this, of course, is completely
consistent, but not entirely obvious to the string theorist steeped in the lore of critical
string theories in conformal gauge. indeed, the simplest physical interpretation of the loop
equation and its meaning in a string theory equivalent to the yangmills theory is obtained
by combining [5] two beautiful results. the rst of these is the observation of marchesini
[6] that the fokkerplanck hamiltonian that arises in parisiwustochastic quantization [7]
is precisely the loop operator, i.e. the operator h such that

hh yi

w (ci)i = 0

(1)

are the schwingerdyson loop equations. the second result is that of jevicki and ro-
drigues [8]: the temporal gauge noncritical string eld theory hamiltonian found in the
work of ishibashi, kawai and collaborators [9] is the fokkerplanck hamiltonian of the ma-
trix model representation of the noncritical string theory.
(for earlier relevant work see
[11,12].) combining these results, i found that the loop operator of the yangmills theory

1

can be interpreted as the exact string eld theory hamiltonian of a noncritical string theory,
provided a crucial consistency condition is satised: the loops must be dened in a manner
that preserves the zigzag symmetry emphasized by polyakov [13]. the string theory dened
by the loop operator is valid at arbitrary n.

now loop equations are notorious for requiring careful regularization [14], so one must
make such formal statements precise with welldened operators. fortunately, since one is
automatically in the framework of stochastic quantization [7,15] there is in fact a continuum
regularization available [16]. i derive in detail the noncritical string theories one obtains in
this manner in [26], but the aim of the present paper is to present a simple toy model in
which all the features mentioned in the previous paragraph are as transparent as can be. in
the process, one nds a resolution for the (decidedly minor) puzzle of a string interpretation
of the unitary matrix model to which i now turn.

the depth of the large n limit is nowhere more apparent than in the model of one
hermitian matrix rst solved by brezin, itzykson, parisi and zuber [17]. the analogue
of their model for gauge theories is the oneplaquette model solved by gross and witten
[18]. this model is dened by a wilson lattice gauge theory action but involving only one
plaquette:

z = z du exp(cid:16)trhv (u) + v (u )i(cid:17)

(2)

where u is a unitary matrix in u(n). this model is solved as follows: u can be diagonalized
since the action and the measure are invariant under u  u. there is a jacobian that
appears in this process so we end up with

z  z y di|(i)|2 exp(cid:16) xhv (eij ) + v (eij )i(cid:17)

(3)

where  is the vandermonde determinant qj>i (cid:16)eii  eij(cid:17) . this integral can be evaluated

by saddlepoints in the large n limit when n/   is held xed. gross and witten [18]
found a thirdorder phase transition in this model. this transition occurs when the coupling
 is strong enough that the eigenvalue distribution has support on the entire unit circle in
the complex plane.

the doublescaling limit [19] solves the hermitian matrix model [17] to all orders in 1/n,
and the random surface interpretation dual to the feynman diagrams of the perturbative
evaluation [20] of the model leads to a connection with quantum gravity in two dimen-
sions [21]. the doublescaling limit can also be used to solve the oneplaquette model in a
monkeysee, monkeydo [22] fashion but there is no convincing random surface interpreta-
tion of this model. the best attempt is presented in [23], but this is not directly on the basis
of observables in the matrix integral, but rather in terms of transformations of integrable
hierarchy equations that arise in these models.

this lack of an interpretation (see, for example, [24]) is surprising. in fact, it seems to be
entirely due to an elision in the literature of the fact that this model is a gauge theory on a
single plaquette. the natural observables in such a gauge theory are tru n  tru n/n, where
n takes positive or negative integer values. these are just wilson loops corresponding to
paths wound around the plaquette n times, i.e. in terms of the discussion at the beginning
of this paper, strings wound around the plaquette.

let us derive the schwingerdyson equations for this model. by the right translation

invariance of the unitary group haar measure, we have

z du etr[v (u )+v (u )]tr (tu n) = z du etr[v (u eh )+v (eh u )]tr(cid:16)t(ueh )n(cid:17)

(4)

where t is a normalized antihermitian matrix and h  p h t is an arbitrary anti
hermitian matrix expanded in terms of the n 2 basis matrices t. using the identities

x

tratbt = tratrb, x

trattrbt = trab

(5)

after dierentiating with respect to h  and summing over , we nd [25] (in the large n
limit, for the simplest case v (u) = u)

(zn+1  zn1) +

n

xp=1

zpznp = 0,

n  1.

(6)

here we have dened htru ni  zn, so in particular z0 = 1. this eq. 6 is precisely the
loop equation [3] in this model. this recursion relation can be used to determine all the
observables zn as a function of , but it should be noted that this equation does not x z1.
for general v, we would need to evaluate 2d  1 zi independently where d is the degree of
the polynomial v. rodrigues [25] studied eq. 6 in detail. in the present case, we shall see
that it is possible to x z1 by nding the fokkerplanck hamiltonian underlying eq. 6, and
demanding that the amplitudes computed from this hamiltonian reproduce eq. 6.

the loop operator derived from eq. 6 is just (for n = )

h  t ()a1 + xn>0

n(cid:20) 1

where i have introduced creation and annihilation operators [an, a
m] = n,m, for |n| > 0,
which create and annihilate strings of winding number n. in the absence of string merging,
strings with positive or negative winding number do not interact.

the string propagates in stochastic time, identied on the basis of [9,8,10] with liouville
time in a noncritical string theory. physical correlation functions are obtained, as standard
in stochastic quantization [7,15], via

lim

in the large n factorization since the strings cannot merge in this limit. we need to x
t (). we require therefore

lim
 

h0|e ha

1|0i = z1 .

following [10], the existence of the large  limit and h|0i = 0 implies

lim
 

h0|e h[h, a

1]|0i = 0.

(10)

since a string of winding number 1 cannot split, eq. 10 gives

t + z1 +

z2 = 0.

(11)

comparing eq. 11 to eq. 6 we nd t = 1/. a simpler way to write h is therefore

h = xn>0

which could have been anticipated. consider the physics of the two limiting values of
. for small  the kinetic term dominates and the string grows or shrinks but does not
split very oftenthe dominant splitting is into one big string and one small string that
is then annihilated. for large  the string splits all the time, and the tadpole is small as
well.
it is easy to see that in this limit z1 = 0, which is of course obvious from z. in
the eigenvalue picture, the eigenvalue distribution is concentrated in a sector on the circle
in the weak coupling ( small) limit whereas it spreads over the whole circle at strong
coupling. presumably the phase transition occurs when string splitting is compensated by
string growth so that the propagation of the string has a selfsimilar character.

having found t in this model, we can evaluate z1 just using h in eq. 9 as claimed. in
this sense, the oneplaquette model is complete since we used eq. 6 to derive the form of h
anyway. (it is of course possible to evaluate z1 independently. first of all, notice that on
account of the symmetry of the measure and the action under inverting u, we have zi = zi.
next, we obviously have

z1 + z1 =

1
n




lnz

(13)

and z is easily evaluated following [18].)

consider now nite values of n. correlations no longer factorize so we consider more

general schwingerdyson equations:



h  z du etr[v (u eh )+v (eh u )]

x

m

xj=1

njtr(cid:16)t(ueh )nj(cid:17)yi6=j

tr(cid:16)(ueh )ni(cid:17) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)h=0

= 0

(14)

ni need no longer be all positive or all negative, since we must allow for strings that wind
in either direction. we now nd a new term, involving the joining of strings:

(cid:28)xj

(hw (nj))yi6=j

w (ni) +

1

n 2 xj xi6=j

ninjw (ni + nj) yk6=i,j

w (nk)(cid:29) = 0

(15)

where we have dened tru ni  w (ni). the extra factor of n 2 arises because the traces in
eq. 5 are not normalized. while we can no longer write a recursion relation for the single
operator expectation values zi, we can write down the nite n hamiltonian from eq. 15:

hn = h +

n 2 xi,j

i+jaiaj,

implicitly replacing a
0  1. a striking dierence between this hamiltonian (eq. 16) and
the hamiltonian in [10] is that here we have strings with positive and negative windings,
whereas in [10] the string length alone is the string eld parameter. recall that in the case of
orthogonal polynomials on a circle it is a similar appearance of negative and positive powers
of z  ei that results in distinct recursion relations compared to orthogonal polynomials
on the real line. it is important to note here that the string joining term is to be treated in
perturbation theory for consistency.

given the hamiltonian hn , we can write down a string eld theory. written in holo-

morphic coordinates, the functional integral for the stochastic time evolution is

(recall a
0  1.) for our purposes, we require vacuum boundary conditions at f = , and
the specied wilson loops in the correlation function at i = 0. in nontrivial models [26]
the regularization needed can only be implemented at the level of the loop operator, not in
the functional integral derived from the loop operator [16]. another striking feature of the
functional integral, not perhaps most obvious in eq. 17, is the appearance of supersymmetry
in the string eld theory as usual in stochastic quantization [27,15].

there is much more that one can derive explicitly in these models especially taking nite
n corrections into account. the explicit solution found in [22] can be used as a check on
this formalism. the main point of this paper however is that there is a string interpretation
of the simplest yangmills theory, the oneplaquette model. this string interpretation is
precisely as stated in [5], as a noncritical string eld theory in temporal gauge, and therefore
is a concrete example of polyakovs conjecture [13]. the zigzag symmetry is of course built
into the formalism here, but needs much more work to maintain in nontrivial models [26].
turning to the interpretation of [23], it could be that the mapping between the unitary
matrix model and models of closed and open strings found in [23] is hiding some deeper dual-
ity between closed string and open and closed string theories. the polyakov duality between
yangmills theory and a noncritical closed string theory is what has been demonstrated here
in a toy model.
