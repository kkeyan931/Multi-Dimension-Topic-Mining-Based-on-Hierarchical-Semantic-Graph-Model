abstract

in supersymmetric models with the run-away vacua or with the stable but non-
supersymmetric ground state there exist stable eld congurations (vacua) which
restore one half of supersymmetry and are characterized by constant positive energy
density. the formal foundation for such vacua is provided by the central extension
of the n = 1 superalgebra with the innite central charge.

in ref. [1] we found a class of unconventional solutions, which exist in supersym-
metric theories with a vacuum moduli space, and are characterized by (i) constant
energy density; (ii) topological stability. they can be considered as a limiting case
of the domain walls (sometimes we deal with the so-called constant phase congu-
rations, sometimes with the winding phase congurations, see sec. 5 of [1]). one
half of supersymmetry may or may not be preserved on these solutions. because of
their topological stability they can become vacua of a theory breaking a part of the
lorentz invariance and supersymmetry. thus, this is a particular realization of the
dynamical compactication, the idea central in ref. [1].

the existence of the topologically stable vacua with the purely gradient (con-
stant) energy density is intuitively clear in the examples considered in ref. [1] since
in these examples there exist moduli forming a continuous manifold of supersym-
metric vacuum states. being physically inequivalent, the vacua are degenerate, the
vacuum energy density vanishes. the vacuum moduli spaces occur frequently in
supersymmetric theories.

here we discuss another class of supersymmetric theories, which, within the stan-
dard understanding, have no supersymmetric vacua at all: either there is no vacuum
whatsoever (the scalar potential has a run-away behavior), or the vacuum state
exists but is non-supersymmetric. our solutions restore a part of supersymmetry.
this pattern is quite unusual  normally, stable eld congurations with higher en-
ergy density have less supersymmetry than the ground state. our analysis shows
that the opposite situation is also possible.

first, we will consider the so-called run-away theories. the most well-known
example of this type is su(2) sqcd with one massless avor [2] (in general, su(n)
sqcd with n  1 avors). at any nite values of elds the minimal energy is not
achieved. one approaches the vanishing energy density at innitely distant points
in the space of elds. so, there is no vacuum in the conventional sense of this word.
then, we will consider models with the spontaneous breaking of supersymmetry
of the oraifeartaigh type [3]. both phenomena are quite common in the zoo of
supersymmetric theories. the oraifeartaigh models appear as a low-energy limit
of various gauge models producing the dynamical supersymmetry breaking (for a
recent review see [4]).

we will show that in both cases bps saturated solutions exist; they are stable
under all localized perturbations, preserve one half of the original supersymmetry
and, thus, present supersymmetric vacuum states. it may well happen that such
solutions in the future will become a component of a phenomenologically successful
scenario (e.g. [5]).

let us start from the run-away vacua. many models with the run-away vacuum
were considered in the literature. for deniteness we focus on models with the
logarithmic superpotential for the moduli,

l =

1

4 z d2d2   +(cid:18)1

2 z d2w + h.c(cid:19)

(1)

where

w = im 3 ln  .

(2)

the parameter m can be always chosen to be real. the scalar potential v is
proportional to ||2 (a mountain peak centered at the origin in the space of
elds). the run-away behavior is obvious.

for the wall-like solutions (i.e. static eld congurations depending only on one

coordinate z) the condition of the bps saturation takes the form [1]


z

=

 w
 

.

(3)

it is quite obvious that, given the superpotential (2), the solution of eq. (3) of the
winding-phase type is

0(z) = mei(z) ,

(z) =

m 3
m2 z .

(4)

for convenience we assumed m to be real; its absolute value is arbitrary (one can
always pass to a complex m by a phase rotation of ). the solution (3) preserves
two out of four supercharges. the energy functional can be written as

e = z d3x

the corresponding vacuum energy density is

e = 2

m 6
m2 .

equation (5) explicitly demonstrates that the system is stable under spatially local-
ized perturbations. indeed, if  = 0 + , and  vanishes at innity,

.

(7)

there are no negative modes. thus, we get a continuous family of vacua with a
constant energy density labelled by the parameter m.

another way to understand the stability is by compactifying the coordinate z
on a circle of the radius r and then taking the limit r  . for nite r only a
discrete number of solutions is allowed m 3/m2 = n/r (n = 1, 2..). thus, m 3/m2
is a topologically conserved winding number density which guaranties the stability
of the conguration. now, taking the limit r, n   with n/r xed we recover
eq. (4).

now, let us discuss a model presenting a classic example of the spontaneous
supersymmetry breaking (the oraifeartaigh mechanism [3]). it includes three chiral
superelds, 1,2,3, with the superpotential

w = 11(2

3  m 2) + 23 .

again, it is convenient to choose the parameters 1, m and  real. superpotential
of the type (8) appear in the low-energy limit of various gauge eld theories with
matter. if m 2 < 2/(22
1) the minimum of energy is achieved at 2 = 3 = 0 and 1
undetermined. at the minimum the f1 term does not vanish, f1 = 1m 2, so that
supersymmetry is broken, and the vacuum energy density e = 2
1m 4. note that the
at direction along 1 is lifted by the z factor arising as a (perturbative) quantum
correction to the kinetic term.

thus, in the at vacuum susy is totally broken. instead, one can try to nd a
bps saturated wall-like solution preserving one half of susy. the bps saturation
conditions now take the form

i
z

=

 w
 i

,

i = 1, 2, 3 .

they have an obvious solution

1 = 1m 2z , 2 = 0, 3 = 0 .

the vacuum energy density for this eld conguration is

e = 2 2

1m 4 ,

(9)

(10)

(11)

i.e. twice higher than in the lorentz-invariant non-supersymmetric vacuum. never-
theless, the conguration (10) is absolutely stable under all localized deformations,
much in the same way as in the case of the winding phase conguration of the
previous example.

in both cases the residual one half of susy guarantees that the fermion-boson
degeneracy persists for the excitation modes in the given backgrounds. in the latter
case, eq. (10), the excitation modes are localized in the z direction (except for a
trivial zero mode which is z-independent).

the total vacuum energy gets no quantum corrections due to the bps-saturated
nature of the wall-like solutions considered. however, the z-independence of the
vacuum energy density is lifted, generally speaking, by quantum corrections to the
kinetic term.
in the weak coupling regime these quantum corrections are small,
however.

the mathematical foundation for the existence of the spatially delocalized vac-
uum congurations with the residual supersymmetry and a (classically) constant
energy density, which we present here, is the central extension of the n = 1 super-
algebra with an innite central charge,

{qq} = z

(12)

where  is proportional to the area tensor in the plane perpendicular to the z
direction, and

z = 2w(z = )  2w(z = )  const l  

(13)

in both models considered. this is a natural generalization of the central extensions
of the n = 1 superalgebra with a nite value of the central charge found and dis-
cussed previously [6]. in the examples discussed in [6] the walls interpolate between
a discrete set of vacua related to each other by phase transformations. therefore,
the central charge can take one of several possible (nite) values from a discrete
nite set. whereas in the present case there exists a symmetry of the model per
se, or of the vacuum state, under which the superpotential w gets a shift. this
explains why the central charge is innite.

in the non-supersymmetric context stable soliton-like vacua in the theories with-
out the lorentz-invariant vacua were discussed recently in ref. [7], where the ques-
tion was raised as to the relevance of such congurations in the cosmological setting.
in supersymmetric world the models with no supersymmetric vacuum are abundant.
the vacua of the type we discuss here may play an important role in the description
of the cosmology emerging, in particular, in the context of the tev planck scale
scenario [8]. first ideas in this direction will be presented in ref. [5].
