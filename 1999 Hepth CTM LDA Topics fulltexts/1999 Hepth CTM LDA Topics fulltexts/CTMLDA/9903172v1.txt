1 introduction

the study of topological quantum eld theories (tqfts) originated from the twist of
n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory has been pursued during the last few years.
these studies have led to the full solution for some of the models involved, and have
provided important tests of our ideas on duality for yang-mills theories in four dimensions.
in this paper we generalize previous results obtained by vafa and witten [1] for one of
the twisted theories.

as in the n = 2 case, the r-symmetry group of the n = 4 algebra can be twisted
to obtain a topological model. but since the r-symmetry group of the n = 4 theory is
su(4), this topological twist can be performed in three inequivalent ways, so one ends up
with three dierent tqfts [1][2][3]. the twisted theories are topological in the sense that
the partition function as well as a selected set of correlation functions are independent
of the metric which denes the background geometry.
in the short distance regime,
computations in the twisted theory are given exactly by a saddle-point calculation around
a certain bosonic background or moduli space, and in fact the correlation functions can be
reinterpreted as describing intersection theory on this moduli space. this correspondence
can be made more precise through the mathai-quillen construction [3]. unfortunately, it
is not possible to perform explicit computations from this viewpoint: the moduli spaces
one ends up with are generically non-compact, and no precise recipe is known to properly
compactify them.

while for the tqfts related to asymptotically free n = 2 theories the interest lies
in their ability to dene topological invariants for four-manifolds, for the twisted n = 4
theories the topological character is used as a tool for performing explicit computations
which might shed light on the structure of the physical n = 4 theory. this theory
is nite and conformally invariant, and is conjectured to have a symmetry exchanging
strong and weak coupling and exchanging electric and magnetic elds, which extends to a
full sl(2, zz) symmetry acting on the microscopic complexied coupling  [4]. in addition
to this, since all the elds in the theory take values in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group, it is possible to consider non-trivial gauge congurations in g/center(g)
and compute the partition function for xed values of the t hooft ux v  h 2(x, 1(g)).
[5] which should behave under sl(2, zz) duality in a well-dened fashion [5]. this has
been checked for the physical n = 4 theory on t 4 in [6]. it is natural to expect that this
property should be shared by the twisted theories on arbitrary four-manifolds. this was
checked by vafa and witten for one of the twisted theories and for gauge group su(2) [1],
and it was clearly mostly interesting to extend their computation to higher rank groups.
similar results have been recently derived for another twisted version of the n = 4 theory
within the u-plane approach [7].

in this paper we will consider the vafa-witten theory for gauge group su(n). the
twisted theory does not contain spinors, so it is well-dened on any compact, oriented four-

1

manifold. the ghost-number symmetry of this theory is anomaly-free, and therefore the
only non-trivial topological observable is the partition function itself. as we mentioned
above, it is possible to consider non-trivial gauge congurations in g/center(g) and
compute the partition function for a xed value of the t hooft ux v  h 2(x, 1(g)).
in this case, however, the seiberg-witten approach is not available, but, as conjectured
by vafa and witten, one can nevertheless compute in terms of the vacuum degrees of
freedom of the n = 1 theory which results from giving bare masses to all the three chiral
multiplets of the n = 4 theory2. the partition functions on k3 for gauge group su(n)
and trivial t hooft uxes have been computed by vafa and collaborators in [8]. we will
extend their results to arbitrary t hooft uxes and compute the partition function on
more general kahler four-manifolds. a brief account of these results has already appeared
in [9].

the paper is organized as follows. in sect. 2 we review the structure of the n = 4
supersymmetric gauge theory in four dimensions and its topological twisting. in sect. 3
we review the vafa-witten theory, which arises as a twisted version of the n = 4 theory,
and analyze the vacuum structure of the n = 1 theory which arises by giving masses to
all the three chiral multiplets of the n = 4 theory. in sect. 4 we derive the partition
function on k3 for g = su(n) with prime n and arbitrary values of the t hooft uxes.
in sect. 5 we generalize the partition function to more general kahler manifolds and
study the properties of the resulting formulas under duality and under blow-ups. finally,
in sect. 6 we state our conclusions. an appendix deals with a set of useful identities and
denitions used in the paper.

2a similar approach was introduced by witten in [10] to obtain the rst explicit results for the

donaldson-witten theory just before the far more powerful seiberg-witten approach was available.

2 twisting n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory on

four-manifolds

in this section we review some aspects of the four-dimensional n =4 gauge theory and its
topological twisting.

2 + 42i

2.1 the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory
we begin with several well-known remarks concerning the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge
theory on at ir4. the n = 4 supersymmetric yang-mills theory is unique once the gauge
group g and the microscopic coupling  = 
e2 are xed. the microscopic theory
contains a gauge or gluon eld, four chiral spinors (the gluinos) and six real scalars.
all the above elds are massless and take values in the adjoint representation of the
gauge group g. from the point of view of n = 1 superspace, the theory contains one
n = 1 vector multiplet and three n = 1 chiral multiplets. these supermultiplets are
represented in n = 1 superspace by the superelds v and s (s = 1, 2, 3), which satisfy
the constraints v = v  and d s = 0, d  being a superspace covariant derivative3. the
n = 4 supersymmetry algebra has the automorphism group su(4)i, under which the
gauge bosons are scalars, the gauginos transform in the 4  4, and the scalars transform
as a self-conjugate antisymmetric tensor uv in the 6.

the action takes the following form in n = 1 superspace:

where w =  1

d2ev dev and tr denotes the trace in the fundamental representation.

the theory is invariant under four independent supersymmetries which transform
under su(4)i, but only one of these is manifest in the n = 1 superspace formulation
(2.1). the global symmetry group of n = 4 supersymmetric theories in ir4 is h =
su(2)l  su(2)r  su(4)i, where k = su(2)l  su(2)r is the rotation group so(4).
 and qu . they transform
the fermionic generators of the four supersymmetries are qu
as (2, 1, 4)  (1, 2, 4) under h.

the massless n = 4 supersymmetric theory has zero beta function, and it is believed
to be exactly nite and conformally invariant, even non-perturbatively. it is in fact the

3we follow the same conventions as in [3].

most promising candidate for the explicit realization of the strong-weak coupling duality
symmetry conjectured some twenty years ago by montonen and olive [4].

2.2 twists of the n = 4 supersymmetric theory

the twist in the context of four-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories was intro-
duced by witten in [11], where it was shown that a twisted version of the n = 2 supersym-
metric gauge theory with gauge group su(2) is a relativistic eld-theory representation of
the donaldson theory of four-manifolds. in four dimensions, the global symmetry group
of the extended supersymmetric gauge theories is of the form su(2)lsu(2)ri, where
k = su(2)l  su(2)r is the rotation group, and i is the chiral r-symmetry group. the
twist can be thought of either as an exotic realization of the global symmetry group of the
theory, or as the gauging (with the spin connection) of a certain subgroup of the global
r-current of the theory.

while in n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theories the r-symmetry group is at most
u(2) and thus the twist is essentially unique (up to an exchange of left and right), in the
n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory the r-symmetry group is su(4) and there are three
dierent possibilities, each corresponding to a dierent non-equivalent embedding of the
rotation group into the r-symmetry group [1][2][3]. two of these possibilities give rise to
topological eld theories with two independent brst-like topological symmetries. one of
these was considered by vafa and witten in [1]. the second possibility was rst addressed
by marcus [12], and his analysis was extended in [3][13]. the remaining possibility leads
to the half-twisted theory, a topological theory with only one brst symmetry [2][3]. the
generating function of topological correlation functions of this theory has been recently
computed for gauge group su(2) and arbitrary values of the t hooft ux in [7] within
the u-plane framework [14].

3 the vafa-witten theory

the vafa-witten theory can be obtained by twisting the n =4 supersymmetric gauge
theory as described in [1][2][3]. the twisted theory has an anomaly free abelian ghost-
number symmetry which is a subgroup of the su(4)i r-symmetry of the n =4 theory.
therefore, the partition function is the only non-trivial topological observable of the
theory [1].

the theory has 2 independent brst charges q of opposite ghost number. the
eld content consists of 3 scalar elds {+2, 2, c 0}, 2 one-forms {a0
 } and 2 self-
dual two-forms {(b+
)0, (h +
)0} on the bosonic (commuting) side; and 2 scalar elds
 } and 2 self-dual two-forms {( +
 , 1
{ +1, 1}, 2 one-forms {1
)1} on the
fermionic (anticommuting) side. the superscript stands for the ghost number carried by

)+1, (+

 , h 0

4

each of the elds.

the twisted n = 4 supersymmetric action breaks up into a q+-exact piece (that is, a
piece which can be written as {q+,t }, where t is a functional of the elds of the theory),
plus a topological term proportional to the instanton number of the gauge conguration,

stwisted = {q+,t }  2ihv,

(3.2)

with hv the instanton number of a gauge bundle with t hooft ux v. this is an integer
for su(n) bundles (v = 0), but for non-trivial su(n)/zzn bundles with v 6= 0 one has

hv = 

n  1
2n

v  v mod zz,

(3.3)

where v  v stands forrx v  v . therefore, as pointed out in [1], one would expect the

su(n) partition function to be invariant under    + 1, while the su(n)/zzn theory
should be only invariant under    + n. notice that, owing to (3.2), the partition
function depends on the microscopic couplings e and  only through the combination
2ihv , and in particular this dependence is a priori holomorphic (were the orientation
of the manifold x reversed, the partition function would depend anti-holomorphically
on  ). however there could be situations in which, because of some sort of holomorphic
anomaly, the partition function would acquire an explicit anomalous dependence on  .
this seems to be the case, for example, for the theory dened on cip2 [1] and, more
generally, on manifolds with b+
2 = 1 [8]. somewhat related results have been derived for
the donaldson-witten theory in the context of the u-plane formalism [14].

3.1 mass perturbations and reduction to n =1

it is a well-known fact that on complex manifolds the exterior dierential d splits into
the dolbeaut operators  and . in a similar way, as pointed out in [10], on a kahler
manifold the number of brst charges of a twisted supersymmetric theory is doubled,
in such a way that, for example, the donaldson-witten theory has an enhanced nt = 2
topological symmetry on kahler manifolds, while the vafa-witten theory has nt = 4
topological symmetry. in each case, one of the brst charges comes from the underlying
n = 1 subalgebra which corresponds to the formulation of the physical theory in n = 1
superspace. by suitably adding mass terms for some of the chiral superelds in the
theory, one can break the extended (n = 2 or n = 4) supersymmetry of the physical
theory down to n = 1. for the reason sketched above, the corresponding twisted massive
theory on kahler manifolds should still retain at least one topological symmetry. one now
exploits the metric independence of the topological theory. by scaling up the metric in
the topological theory, g  tg, one can take the limit t  . in this limit, the metric
on x becomes nearly at, and it is reasonable that the computations in the topological
eld theory can be performed in terms of the vacuum structure of the n = 1 theory.

5

one could wonder as to what the eect of the perturbation may be. the introduction
of a mass perturbation may (and in general will) distort the original topological eld
theory. this poses no problem in the case of the donaldson-witten theory, as witten was
able to prove that the perturbation is topologically trivial, in the sense that it aects the
theory in an important but controllable way [10]. as for the vafa-witten theory [1][15][16],
the twisted massive theory is topological on kahler four-manifolds with h2,0 6= 0, and the
partition function is actually invariant under the perturbation. the constraint h2,0 6= 0
comes about as follows. in the twisted theory the chiral superelds of the n = 4 theory
are no longer scalars, so the mass terms can not be invariant under the holonomy group
of the manifold unless one of the mass parameters be a holomorphic two-form .

the massive n = 1 theory has the tree level superpotential

e2 z d4xd2 tr(cid:8)1[2, 3](cid:9) + mzx
+zx

d2tr(3)2 + h.c.

w =

d2tr(12)

up to a constant rescaling the equations for a critical point of w are

[3, 1] = m3,
[3, 2] = m2,
[1, 2] = 23.

(3.4)

(3.5)

as noted in [1][17], these equations are the commutation relations of the lie algebra
of su(2), and therefore the classical vacua of the resulting n = 1 theory can be classied
by the complex conjugacy classes of homomorphisms of the su(2) lie algebra to that of
g = su(n).

eqs. (3.5) admit a trivial solution 1 = 2 = 3 = 0 where the gauge group is unbroken
and which reduces at low energy to the n = 1 pure su(n) gauge theory (which has
n discrete vacua), and a non-trivial solution (the irreducible embedding in [1]) where
the gauge group is completely broken. this corresponds to {1, 2, 3} dening the
representation n of su(2). all these vacua have a mass gap: the irreducible embedding
is a higgs vacuum, while the presence of a mass gap in the trivial vacua is a well-known
feature of the n = 1 theory. when n is prime, these are the only relevant vacua of the
n = 1 theory. there are other, more general, solutions to (3.5) which leave dierent
subgroups of g unbroken. however, in all these solutions the unbroken gauge group
contains u(1) factors and one expects on general grounds that they should not contribute
to the partition function [1]. on the other hand, when n is not prime, there are additional
contributions coming from embeddings for which the unbroken gauge group is su(d),

6

where d is a positive divisor of d. the low-energy theory is again an n = 1 su(d) gauge
theory wihout matter with d massive discrete vacua.

in the long-distance limit, the partition function is given as a nite sum over the
contributions of the discrete massive vacua of the resulting n = 1 theory. for g = su(n)
the number of such vacua is given by the sum of the positive divisors of n [17]. the
contribution of each vacuum is universal (because of the mass gap), and can be xed by
comparing to known mathematical results [1].

7

4 the partition function on k3

as a rst step towards the derivation of the formula for the partition function we will
consider the theory on k3, where some explicit results are already available. for x a
k3 surface the canonical divisor is trivial, so there exists a nowhere vanishing section of
the bundle of (2, 0) forms. therefore, the mass perturbation  does not vanish anywhere
and the above analysis of the vacuum structure of the n =1 theory carries over without
change.

the structure of the partition function for trivial t hooft ux was conjectured in [1].
this conjecture has been conrmed in [8] by studying the eective theory on n coincident
m5-branes wrapping around k3  t 2. the partition function for zero t hooft ux is
almost a hecke transformation of order n [18] of g( ) = ( )24, with ( ) the dedekind
function  see eq. (3.7) in [8]:

zv=0  zn =

n 2 x0a,b,dzz

ad=n, b<d

d g(cid:18)a + b
d (cid:19) .

(4.6)

notice that the number of terms in (4.6) equals the sum of the positive divisors of n as
we mentioned above. when n is prime the formula is considerably simpler

there are n + 1 terms, the rst one corresponding to the irreducible embedding, and the
other n to the vacua of the n =1 su(n) sym theory.

(4.8)

notice the rst equality in (4.8), which is, up to some correction factors which vanish in
at space, the original montonen-olive conjecture.

to generalize (4.7) for gauge congurations with arbitrary t hooft ux we proceed
as in [1]. the n contributions coming from the n = 1 pure gauge theory vacua are
related by an anomalous chiral symmetry which takes    + 1. the anomaly is
theory. hence, the contributions from each vacuum pick anomalous phases eimhv =

the above results only hold for prime n. the appropriate generalization for arbitrary n
should be also investigated.

4note that k3 has  = 24,  = 16, b1 = 0 and b2 = 22.

5 more general kahler manifolds

on more general kahler manifolds the spatially dependent mass term vanishes where 
does, and we will assume as in [1][10] that  vanishes with multiplicity one on a union of
disjoint, smooth complex curves cj, j = 1, . . . n of genus gj which represent the canonical
divisor k of x. the vanishing of  introduces corrections involving k and additional
modular functions whose precise form is not known a priori.
in the g = su(2) case,
each of the n = 1 vacua bifurcates along each of the components cj of the canonical
divisor into two strongly coupled massive vacua. this vacuum degeneracy is believed to
stem [1][10] from the spontaneous breaking of a zz2 chiral symmetry which is unbroken in
bulk. this is exactly the same pattern that arises in all known examples of twisted n = 2
theories with gauge group su(2) as the donaldson-witten theory and its generalizations
[10][14][19]. this in turn seems to be related to the possibility of rewritting the corrections
near the canonical divisor in terms of the seiberg-witten invariants [20]. in fact, it is
known that the vafa-witten partition function for g = su(2) can be rewritten in terms
of the seiberg-witten invariants [16].

the form of the corrections for g = su(n) is more involved. from related results
on donaldson-witten theory [21] we know that the higher-rank case presents some new
features. we have not been able to disentangle the structure of the vacua near the
canonical divisor from rst principles. instead, we will exploit the expected behaviour of
the partition function under blow-ups of x. this, together with the modular invariance
of the partition function will suce to completely determine the unknown functions.

5.1 behaviour under blow-ups

dimensional lattice spanned by the poincare dual of the exceptional divisor b created by

blowing up a point on a kahler manifold x replaces it with a new kahler manifold bx
whose second cohomology lattice is h 2(bx, zz) = h 2(x, zz)  i , where i  is the one-
the blow-up. any allowed zzn uxbv on bx is of the formbv = v  r, where v is a ux in x
as above, the partition functions for xed t hooft uxes bzbx,bv factorize as zx,v times a

and r = b,  = 0, 1, . . . n  1. the main result concerning the su(2) partition function
in [1] is that under blowing up a point on a kahler four-manifold with canonical divisor

level 1 character of the su(2) wzw model. it would be natural to expect that the same
factorization holds for g = su(n), but now with the level 1 su(n) characters. in fact,
the same behaviour under blow-ups has been proved by yoshioka [22] for the generating
function of euler characteristics of su(n) instanton moduli space on kahler manifolds.
this should not come out as a surprise since it is known that, on certain four-manifolds,
the partition function of vafa-witten theory computes euler characteristics of instanton
moduli spaces [1][8]. this can be conrmed by realizing the vafa-witten theory as the
low-energy theory of m5-branes wrapped on x  t 2 [23]. it seems therefore natural to

10

assume that the same factorization holds for the partition function with g = su(n).

explicitly, given a t hooft ux bv = v  b,  = 0, 1, . . . n  1, on bx, we assume the

factorization [22]

,

(5.12)

zbx,bv( ) = zx,v( )

( )
( )

where ( ) is the appropriate level 1 character of su(n)  see appendix a.3 for details.
this assumption xes almost completely the form of the partition functions. some loose
ends can be tied up by demanding modular invariance of the resulting expression.

5.2 the formula for the partition function

given the assumptions above, and taking into account the structure of the partition
function on k3, we are in a position to write down the formula for kahler four-folds x
with h(2,0) 6= 0. we will rst assume that the canonical divisor k is connected and with
genus g  1 = 2 + 3. the formula is then

zv = n 1x=0(cid:18) 
v,[k]n!(cid:18) 1

(5.14)

the structure of the corrections near the canonical divisor in (5.13) suggests that the
mechanism at work in this case is not chiral symmetry breaking. indeed, near k there is
an n-fold bifurcation of the vacuum, and the functions , m, (with m xed) are not
related by a shift in  as it would be the case were chiral symmetry breaking responsible
for the bifurcation. a plausible explanation for this bifurcation could be found in the
spontaneous breaking of the center of the gauge group (which for g = su(n) is precisely
zzn .) this could come about as follows. let us focus on the irreducible embedding.
for trivial canonical divisor the gauge group is almost but not completely higgsed in
this vacuum.
in fact, since the scalar elds transform in the adjoint representation of

11

su(n), the center zzn  su(n) remains unbroken. the su(n) gauge threory has zzn
string-like solitons [5] which carry non-trivial zzn -valued electric and magnetic quantum
numbers. if these solitons condense, the center zzn is completely broken giving rise to
an n-fold degeneracy of the vacuum. each vacuum is singled out by a dierent value
of the zzn -valued ux. now for non-trivial canonical divisor k as above, the irreducible
vacuum separates into n vacua with magnetic uxes [k]n ! one could be tempted to
speculate further and identify the surface k (or the cj below) with the world-sheet of the
condensed string soliton.

as in [1] we can generalize the above formula for the case that the canonical divisor
consists of n disjoint smooth components cj, j = 1, . . . , n of genus gj on which  vanishes
with multiplicity one. the resulting expression is:

(5.16)

where j = 0, 1, . . . n  1 are chosen independently. notice that (5.15) reduces to

(5.13) when n = 1.

the formulas for the partition function do not apply directly to the n = 2 case. for
n = 2 there are some extra relative phases ti  see equations (5.45) and (5.46) in [1] 
which are absent for n > 2 and prime. modulo these extra phases, (5.13) and (5.15) are
a direct generalization of vafa and wittens results. they reduce on k3 to the formula
of minahan, nemeschansky, vafa and warner [8] and generalize their results to non-zero
t hooft ux.

5.2.1 blow-ups

given (5.15), we can see explicitly how the factorization property (5.12) works. let x be
a kahler four-fold with euler characteristic  = 2(1 b1) + b2, signature  = b+
2 and
canonical divisor k = n

j=1cj, and let bx be its one blow-up at a smooth point. then

2  b

12

thus, the partition function (5.15) takes the form

divisor, which satises b  cj = 0 and b2 = 1 = gb  1. consider a t hooft ux

bb1 = b1,bb2 = b2 + 1, b =  + 1, b =   1 and bk = k  b, where b is the exceptional
bv = v bb in bx, where v is a ux in x and b is an integer dened modulo n. now
b = ,bv2 = v2 b2,bv  cj = v  cj,bv  b =bb2 = b and bwn (~) =pn

5.2.2 modular transformations

we will now study the modular properties of the partition functions (5.13) and (5.15).
with the formulas in the appendix one can check that they have the expected modular
behaviour5

which is the montonen-olive relation. notice that since n is odd, the su(n) (or
su(n)/zzn ) partition function is modular (up to a phase) for 0(n), or 0(n/2) for
spin manifolds. on the other hand, for even n one would expect on general grounds [1]
modularity for 0(2n), or at most 0(n) for spin manifolds.

5we assume as in [1] that there is no torsion in h2(x, zz). were this not case, eqs. (5.24) and (5.15)

above should be modied along the lines explained in [24].

5.2.3 the partition function on t 4

we will nish by considering the twisted theory on t 4, where an unexpected result
emerges. as k3, t 4 is a compact hyper-kahler manifold (hence with trivial canoni-
it has b1 = 4, b2 = 6 and  = 0 = . on t 4 the partition function (5.13)

6 conclusions

in this paper we have obtained the partition function of the vafa-witten theory for gauge
group su(n) (with prime n) on kahler four-manifolds with b+
2 > 1. the resulting
formulas (5.13) and (5.15) turn out to transform as expected under the modular group,
and they can be seen as predictions for the euler numbers of instanton moduli spaces on
those four-manifolds.

it could be interesting to investigate whether (5.13) and (5.15) can be rewritten in
terms of the seiberg-witten invariants. we believe that this is not the case for the follow-
ing reason. let us suppose that it is actually possible to do so. then one would expect,
by analogy with the result for su(2) [16],that the donaldson-witten partition function
for su(n) [21] should be recovered from the vafa-witten su(n) partition function in
the decoupling limit q  0, m   with m4q xed. in particular, one would expect
that the structure of the corrections involving the canonical divisor should be preserved
in this limit. now in the dw partition function in [21], these corrections are written in
terms of the seiberg-witten classes x [20]. for g = su(n) these basic classes appear
nx1    nxn 1 (nxl are the seiberg-witten invariants [20]).
therefore, for g = su(n) there are n  1 independent basic classes contributing to the
above sum. on a kahler manifold with canonical divisor k = c1  c2      cn, with
the cj disjoint and with multiplicity one, each of these basic classes can be written as

in the generic form px1,...xn 1

xl =xj

l

j
l cj,

with each j
l = 1 [20], and the sum over the basic classes can be traded for a sum
over the j
l . this is analogous to the sum over the j in (5.15), and both sums should
contain the same number of terms were it possible to rewrite (5.15) in terms of the basic
classes. however, while in the sum over the j
l there are 2n(n 1) terms, the sum over the
j contains n n terms. notice that these two numbers do coincide when n = 2, as it
should be, but for n 6= 2 this is no longer the case.

it would certainly be mostly interesting to extend these results to all n (not necessarily
prime), and to investigate what the large n limit of (5.13) and (5.15) correspond to on the
gravity side in the light of the ads/cft correspondence [25]. although there are already
some indications of how this correspondence should work [26][27], a clear understanding
is still lacking. we expect to address some of these issues in the near future.

appendix

here we collect some useful formulas which should help the reader follow the compu-

tations in the paper.

a.1 modular forms

the function g is dened as

g( ) =

1

( )24 ,

and is a modular form of weight 12
g( )   +1 g( ),

g( )

  12g( ),

(a.1)

(a.2)

from (a.2) we can determine the modular behaviour of the dierent modular forms in
the k3 partition function

  12g(cid:18) + h
n (cid:19) ,

g(cid:18) + m

n (cid:19) 1/

(a.3)

where 1  h  n  1, mh = 1 mod n and n prime.

b < d [8]. these functions transform as follows

for arbitrary n one has to consider the modular forms g(cid:0) a +b
a d (cid:19) ,
g(cid:18)p + ab
where p = gcd (b, d), d = d/p, b = b/p, bb = 1 mod d.
b = 0 = b. notice that for prime n (a.4) reduces to (a.3).

  12(cid:18)a

g(cid:18)a + b

d (cid:19)  1/

p(cid:19)12

if b = 0, then p = d and

d (cid:1), where ad = n and

(a.4)

a.2 flux sums

the basic sums we have to consider are of the form

i(m, n) =

n 1x=0

im

n (n ) =

e

n 1x=0

18

ei n 1

n m2

(a.5)

for 1  m  n  1, and discrete fourier transformations thereof

e 2i

n 

ei n 1

n m2

,

(a.6)

n 1x=0

from which the sums over uxes can be easily computed. the basic sum (a.5) is related to

a standard gauss sum g(m, n) =pr mod n e2imr2/n [28]. in fact, i(m, n) = i(m+n, n)

and, since n is odd, it suces to consider the case where m is even. but in this case

i(2a, n) =

ei n 1

n 2a2

n 1x=0

=x

e2ia2/n = g(a, n).

(a.7)

now, when a = 1,

g(1, n) =

n
2

([28], p. 165.) moreover, for a > 1 and n an odd prime,

2 (cid:17) ,
(1 + i)(cid:16)1 + e in
n(cid:17) g(1, n),

g(a, n) =(cid:16) a

(a.8)

(a.9)

where(cid:0) a

n(cid:1) is the legendre symbol [28], which is +1 if a is a perfect square (mod n) and

1 otherwise. hence, taking (a.7)-(a.9) into account we have the result

ei n 1

n m2

= (m)ne i

8 (n 1)2

,

(a.10)

n 1x=0

where

(m) =

(cid:16) m/2
n (cid:17) ,
(cid:16) (m+n )/2

n

m even,

(cid:17) , m odd,

(a.11)

if kh = 1 mod n, (k) = (h) for n = 5 mod 4, and (k) = (h) for n = 3 mod 4.

this property is essential in proving the second relation in (5.22).

we also have the identity

e 2i

n 

= n,0,

(a.12)

n 1x=0

and the fundamental result

now, given (a.10), the basic sum over uxespv ei n 1

of (a.5) as follows  see [1], eq. (3.21)-(3.22):

n mv2 can be computed in terms

a.3 su (n ) characters

we have seen above that the corrections to the su(n) partition function near the canon-
ical divisor of the four-manifold x are given in terms of the level one characters  of the
su(n) wzw model. these are dened as [29]

( ) =

1

( )n 1 x~w[]

ei ~w2

,

  zz mod n,

(a.18)

where [] is the -th conjugacy class of su(n), and the identication ( ) = +n ( )
is understood. also, from the symmetry properties of the inverse cartan matrix (a.19)
it follows that  = n .  = 0 mod n corresponds to ~w in the root lattice, while for

1    n  1, [] = { ~w  weight : ~w = ~ +pn zz n ~}. ~ are the simple roots and

~ the fundamental weights of su(n), normalized in such a way that the inverse cartan
matrix a has the standard form
