(46) give dierent directions branch curves (worldlines point defects) bifurcation point. four possible cases, show physical meanings bifurcation points. case 1 (a 6= 0): = 4(b2 ac) > 0 eq. (45) get two dierent directions velocity eld point defects 11 dx1 dt |1,2= b b2 ac , (47) two worldlines two point defects intersect dierent directions bifurcation point. shows two point defects encounter depart bifurcation point. case 2 (a 6= 0): = 4(b2 ac) = 0 eq. (45) get one direction velocity eld point defects dx1 dt |1,2= b . (48) includes three important cases. (a) two worldlines tangentially contact, i.e. two point defects tangentially encounter bifurcation point. (b) two worldlines merge one worldline, i.e. two point defects merge one point defect bifurcation point. (c) one worldline resolves two worldlines, i.e. one point defect splits two point defects bifurcation point. case 3 (a = 0, c 6= 0): = 4(b2 ac) = 0 eq. (46) dt dx1 |1,2= b b2 ac c = 0, 2b c . (49) two important cases: (a) one worldline resolves three worldlines, i.e. one point defect splits three point defects bifurcation point. (b) three worldlines merge one worldline, i.e. three point defects merge one point defect bifur- cation point. case 4 (a = c = 0): eq. (45) eq. (46) gives respectively dx1 dt = 0, dt dx1 = 0. (50) case obvious similar case 3. solutions reveal evolution point defects. besides encountering point defects, i.e. two point defects encounter depart bifurcation point along dierent branch curves, also includes spliting merging point defects. multicharged point defect moves bifurcation point, may split 12 several point defects along dierent branch curves. contrary, several point defects merge one point defect bifurcation point. identical conversation topological charge shows sum topological charge nal point defect(s) must equal initial point defect(s) bifurcation point, i.e., xf lf lf = xi lili (51) xed l. furthermore, studies, see generation, annihilation bifurcation point defects gradual changes, start critical value arguments, i.e. sudden change. c. branch process higher degenerated point subsection, studied case rank jacobian matrix  eqs.
