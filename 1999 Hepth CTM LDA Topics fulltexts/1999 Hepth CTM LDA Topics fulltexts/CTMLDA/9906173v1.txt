abstract

the curvature scalar -r/const in the einstein-gilbert action can be replaced by the energy-momentum
scalar of the matter t. this additional energy term in lagrangians of particles and elds not disappears
on a ate space-time and can be considered as a gravitational self energy. it is shown that this term in
lagrangians of quantum elds naturally induced renormalizational counterterms. as result not need in
introduction by hand of additional counterterms.

the renormalizational procedures in the quantum eld theory are very fruitful and appropriate but
theoretically not good understandable operations. we knew that we must introduce into lagrangians of
elds any compensational terms but we do not knew what means this terms, what is a source of such
additional terms and what fundamental principles are requiring of such operations.

in this paper i shall propose a natural renormalizational procedure on the basis of a gravitational self
energy of particles and elds and in this treatment of the renormalization the answers to above methodological
questions are obviously.

for a classical eld with a lagrangian density l we have the einstein-gilbert action:

s =

1

c z dg(

2

r + l) =

1

c z d(

1
2

r + l)

(1)

where  = 8k/c4, k is the gravitational constant, r is the ricci tensor, r = gr, l = gl. the

einstein equation for the curvature scalar from this action function is:

1




r = t

the gravitational term in the action function eq.(1) usually not considered on a at space-time with

gik = ik and g = 1. but if we rewrite the einstein-gilbert action eq.(1) by taking into account eq.(2)

as:

s =

1

c z d(

1
2

t + l)

(6)

then we see that the rst term can not be simply neglected on the at space-time.
we can neglect it not at beginning of the quantization of the eld, but after a calculation of a vacuum

uctuations contribution.

so, we have an extended classical lagrangian:

an eective lagrangian with quantum corrections can be written as:

l(cl) =

1
2

t(0) + l(0)

l(q) = l(cl) + l(q) =

= (

t(0) + l(0)) + (

t + l) =

t(f in) + l(f in))] + (

t(div) + l(div)) =

where t = t(f in) + t(div) and l = l(f in) + l(div) are total quantum corrections, t(f in)

and l(div) are nite parts of quantum corrections, t(div) and l(div) are divergence parts.

here the renormalized lagrangian l

(ren)
(q)

contains only nite terms:

l(ren)

(q) =

1
2

(t(0) + t(f in)) + (l(0) + l(f in)) = (

1
2

t(ren) + l(ren))

(12)

we will show that a contribution of the divergence terms l(div)

(q)

system is zero. a variations of t(div) and l(div) are:

where gik

(div) is the einstein tensor.

we have the separate einstein equations for the divergence terms:

t(div)  t(f in)

this means that:

t(div) + l(div)] = 0

(q) = (tik)(div)
l(div)

as result, the divergent gravitational (negative energy) contributions exactly compensated the divergent
quantum corrections to the lagrangian. then we can exclude gravitational terms from the renormalized
(nite) part of the lagrangian.

finally, we conclude, that the excluding of the gravitational self energy terms from the classical la-
grangians of elds is correct procedure only if we do that after cancellation of the divergence terms. but
then we do not need in an additional divergent counterterms.

in future publications i shall consider applications of this new ideology of the renormalizations to the

quantization of concrete elds.
