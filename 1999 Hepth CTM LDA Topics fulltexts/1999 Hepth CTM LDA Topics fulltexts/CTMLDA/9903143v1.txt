electrically charged solutions breaking half of the supersymmetry in anti-de
sitter four dimensional n = 2 supergravity coupled to vector supermultiplets are con-
structed. these static black holes live in an asymptotic ads4 space time. the killing

introduction

supersymmetric solutions of n = 2 ungauged supergravity theory in four and ve di-
mensions have received lots of attention in recent years [1, 2, 3]. such solutions play a
fundamental role in probing the (non)-perturbative phase transitions taking place among
n = 2 string vacua and m-theory [4]. these solutions admit perturbative and non-
perturbative corrections and exhibit a rich structure due to less supersymmetry and the
special and very special geometries underlying d = 4 and d = 5 n = 2 supergravity
theories. bps solutions provide a link between the structure of the internal space, e.g.
a calabi-yau threefold, and the physical properties of the four-dimensional space-time.
singularities in space-time could be related to special points in the internal space. using
non-trivial space-time dependent solutions of n = 2 supergravity, some information can
be obtained about the dynamical nature of the non-perturbative topological transitions
[5].

recently, there has been renewed interest in gauged supergravity theories in var-
ious dimensions.
it is motivated by the fact that the ground state of these theories is
anti-de sitter (ads) space-time and thus they may have implications for the recently
proposed ads/conformal eld theory (cft) correspondence [6]. this implies an equiv-
alence of type iib string theory (or m-theory) on anti-de sitter (ads) space-time and
the conformal eld theory (cft) on the boundary of this space. it is of special interest
to address cases with lower or no supersymmetry, in order to shed light on the nature
of the correspondence there. supergravity vacua with less supersymmetry may have an
interpretation on the cft side as an expansion of the theory around non-zero vacuum
expectation value of certain operators. solutions with no supersymmetry could also be
viewed as excitations above the ground state of the theory. this makes the study of black
holes in gauged supergravity a subject of current research interest. moreover, it has been
realised recently that ads spaces admit the so-called topological black holes which have
some unusual geometric and physical features [7].

the purpose of this paper is to describe static electric bps black hole solutions of
d=4 gauged supergravity theories with vector supermultiplets. these gauged supergrav-
ity theories admit the ads4 space-time as a ground state. the analysis is general as we
formulate our solutions in terms of the holomorphic sections of d=4, n=2 supergravity.
n = 4, 8 black holes appear as a special subclass for special choices of the prepoten-
tial of the n = 2 theory. for the pure supergravity case (i. e, no vector multiplets),
reissner-nordstrom solutions have been discussed in [8]. supersymmetric solutions have
been obtained recently for the theory of n = 2 supergravity in ve dimensions [9] as well
as for the n = 8, d = 4 theory [10]. also bps topological black hole solutions for the
pure n = 2 supergravity case have been constructed in [11]. the spherically symmetric
bps electric solutions can be obtained by solving for the vanishing of the gravitino and
gaugino supersymmetry variations for a particular choice for the supersymmetry parame-
ter. we will present here only static non-rotating spherically symmetric electric solutions

2

which break half of supersymmetry and leave the rotating, magnetic and more general
solutions for a separate publication. the construction of our solutions relies very much
on special geometry of the n = 2 supergravity theories. for this reason, we review this
subject and collect some formulae and expressions of n = 2 supergravity which will be
important for the following discussion. also the general bps solutions of n = 2 black
holes [2] in the theory of ungauged n = 2 supergravity with vector supermultiplets are
briey discussed. our conventions are collected in the appendix.

2 special geometry and black holes in n = 2 supergravity

special geometry comes about when one couples vector supermultiplets to n = 2 super-
gravity in four space-time dimensions (for a recent discussion and references therein see
[12]) . the complex scalars za of the vector supermultiplets of the n = 2 supergravity
theory are coordinates which parametrise a special kahler manifold. roughly, this is a
kahler-hodge manifold with a constraint on the curvature, ra bc d = ga b gc d +ga d gc b
cace c b d l ge l, here ga b = a bk, is the kahler metric with k the kahler potential
and cabc is a completely symmetric covariantly holomorphic tensor. kahler-hodge man-
ifolds are characterised by a u(1) bundle whose rst chern class is equal to the kahler
class, thus, locally, the u(1) connection can be represented by

the n = 2 supergravity action includes in addition to the gravitational super-
multiplets, a number of vector and hypermultiplets. throughout this work, the hyper-
multiplets are assumed to be constants. in this case, the bosonic n = 2 action is given

we now review the construction of the stationary solutions to the theory of un-
gauged n = 2 supergravity [2]. it is well known from the work of tod [13] that such
metrics can be brought to the following form

ds2 = e2u (dt + mdxm)2 + e2u dxmdxm.

(13)

for this metric, the components of the spin connection are given as follows

wt 0i = e2u iu,
wm 0i =

e2u (mwi  iwm)  e2u wmiu,

wt ij =

e4u (iwj  jwi),

wm ij = iu mj  ju mi +

e4u wm(iwj  jwi).

the equations of motion and the bianchi identities for the gauge elds can be

solved by

where ( h i(x), hi(x)) are harmonic functions.

the bps solution can be expressed in the following form [2]
e2u  z z  i( y ifi(y )  y i fi( y ))

e2u mnpnwp  qm = e2u re( fi( y )y i  y i fi(y ),

i(fi(y )  fi( y ) = i( zmi  z mi ) = hi

where q = q  i

(16)

for the above ansatz, one can demonstrate that the time-component for the
gravitino supersymmetry transformation as well as those of the gaugino vanish for the
following choice of the spinor supersymmetry parameter

z

m log z(cid:19)  = 0.

(18)

the integrability condition enforces the condition that the eld strength of qm has to
vanish. for static non-singular solutions, i.e., wm = 0, one imposes the vanishing of qm.

3 electric bps solutions in 4d n=2 anti-de sitter supergrav-

ity

in this section we derive the solution for electric bps states in the theory of abelian
gauged n = 2 supergravity coupled to vector supermultiplets [14]. the theory of gauged
n = 2 supergravity without vector multiplets was rst discussed in [15] and bps solutions
of this theory were discussed in [8, 16]. more recently, supersymmetric topological black
holes were obtained in the theory of n = 2 anti-de sitter supergravity in [11]. here
we will concentrate on electrically charged spherically symmetric bps solutions of the
theory of gauged n = 2 supergravity coupled to vector supermultiplets. the abelian
gauging is achieved by introducing a linear combination of the abelian vector elds ai

already present in the theory, a = i ai
 with a coupling constant g, where i are
constants. the coupling of the fermi-elds to this vector eld breaks supersymmetry
which in order to preserve one has to introduce gauge-invariant g-dependent terms. in a
bosonic background, these additional terms result in a scalar potential [14]

v = g2(cid:16)ga bi j f i

a

f j
b  3i j li lj(cid:17) .

(19)

moreover, the supersymmetry transformations for the gauginos and the gravitino

in a bosonic background become (in terms of complex spinors),

(20)

(21)

in what follows we are mainly concerned with bosonic backgrounds which break

half of supersyymetry. consider the following general form for the metric

ds2 = e2adt2 + e2bdr2 + e2c r2(d2 + sin2 d2).

(22)

the vielbeins of this metric are

and the spin connections

t = aeab,
01
 = (1 + rc )ecb,
12
 = (1 + rc )ecb sin ,
13
23
 =  cos .

(24)

motivated by the form of the bps solution in d = 5, n = 2 gauged supergravity
[9], we choose the following ansatz for the electrically charged bps solutions in four-
dimensional ads supergravity

e2a = e2b = e2u f 2,
e2u  z z  i( y ifi(y )  y i fi( y )) = y i hi ,

e2c = e2u ,

i(y i  y i) = 0,
i(fi(y )  fi( y ) = hi ,

ai

t = e2u y i .

(25)

where u and f are functions depending only on the radial distance and are to be deter-
mined.

in terms of the coordinates (y i , fi(y )), the vanishing of the time component for

the gravitino supersymmetry transformation gives the following equation

a way that the spinor  satises

(27) breaks half of supersymmetry. from eq. (26) one obtains the following equations

it can be shown that all the conditions imposed by unbroken supersymmetry which are
given by (37) and (28) are satised if we set

here we summarize our solution

the radial dierential equation can be solved using the techniques described in

(42)

where 1 is an operator satisfying 2

1 = 1. also suppose that (r) is subject to the

(r) = (cid:16)x(r)1 + y (r)2(cid:17)(r),

in summary, we have obtained spherically symmetric electric bps solutions which
break half of supersymmetry in the theory of n = 2 anti-de sitter supergravity with
vector supemultiplets. the solution is expressed in terms of the holomorphic sections and
therefore independent of the existence of a holomorphic prepotential. note that a subclass
of solutions of n = 2 supergravity (for a particular choice of prepotential) are actually
also solutions of supergravity theories with more, i.e. n = 4 or n = 8 supersymmetries.
the d=4 static bps-saturated electric black holes of gauged supergravity have naked
singularities. the generalisation of the results of this paper to the non-extreme static
black hole solutions is straightforward and can be done along the same lines of [17].

3notice that the integrability condition (44) is satised.
