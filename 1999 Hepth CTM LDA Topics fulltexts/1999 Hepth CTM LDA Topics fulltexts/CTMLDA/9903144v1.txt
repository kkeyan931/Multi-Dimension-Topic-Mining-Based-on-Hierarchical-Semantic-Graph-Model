abstract: we construct vacua of heterotic mtheory with general gauge bundles and
vebranes. some aspects of the resulting lowenergy eective theories are discussed.

mtheory on the orbifold s1/z2 is believed to describe the strong coupling limit of the
e8  e8 heterotic string [1] and, therefore, constitutes a particularly interesting starting
point for mtheory particle phenomenology. at low energy, this theory is described by
11dimensional supergravity coupled to two 10dimensional e8 gauge multiplets residing
on the two xed points of the orbifold [2, 4, 3]. compactications leading to n = 1
supersymmetry in four dimensions are based on spacetimes of the structure

m11 = s1/z2  x  m4,

(1)

where x is a calabiyau three-fold and m4 is at minkowski space. while most work
to date, related to such compactications of heterotic mtheory, has been limited to
the standard embedding, nonstandard embedding vacua have previously been addressed
in [6, 7, 8].

here, we will consider the general conguration leading to n = 1 supersymmetry [9],
where, rst, we allow for general gauge bundles, and, second, include ve-branes [3],
states which are essentially non-perturbative in heterotic string theory. the important
new ingredient is the presence of these vebranes in the vacua. some eects caused by
the presence of the vebranes have been discussed in [7, 10]. due to gauge and gravity
sources on the orbifold planes and the vebrane sources, the spacetime (1) receives
corrections that can be computed perturbatively as an expansion in [5]

where , v and  are the 11dimensional newton constant, the calabiyau volume and
the orbifold radius, respectively.

let us now determine these corrections to linear order in es. we need to specify the
11dimensional metric gij, the threeform cijk with eld strength gijkl = 24 [icjkl]
(where i, j, k, . . . = 0, . . . , 9, 11) and the killing spinor . this can be done solving the
bianchi identity

are given in term of the e8 gauge eld strengths f (i), i = 1, 2, and the curvature. in
addition, we have considered n vebranes transverse to the orbifold. they induce the
sources j (n), n = 1, . . . , n appearing in the above bianchi identity. we have chosen the
orbifold coordinate x11 to be in the range x11  [, ] with the orbifold planes at
x11 = 0,  and the vebranes at x11 = x1, . . . ,xn . from eq. (3), the sum of all these
sources must be cohomologically trivial.
one must also ensure that the theories on the orbifold planes and the vebranes
preserve supersymmetry. this is guaranteed by choosing two semistable holomorphic
(otherwise arbitrary) e8 gauge bundles vi and by wrapping the vebranes on holomorphic
calabiyau twocycles while stretching them over the fourdimensional uncompactied
space. with this choice, all sources j (n), n = 0, . . . , n + 1 are (2, 2) forms on the calabi
yau space. the cohomology condition on the sources can now be expressed as

"n +1
xn=0

j (n)# = c2(v1) + c2(v2)  c2(t x) + [w ] = 0 .

(5)

here c2(vi) and c2(t x) are the second chern classes of the vector bundles vi and the
n=1[j (n)] is the cohomology class of the total vebrane

where g(0)

components of the fourform and that the other corrections have the structure

fourdimensional space is indexed by , ,  . . . = 0, . . . , 3 while we use a, b, c, . . . =
4, . . . , 9 for the calabiyau space. furthermore, holomorphic (antiholomorphic) calabi
yau indices are denoted by a, b, c, . . . (a, b, c, . . .). the corrections can be entirely expressed
in terms of a (1, 1) form bab on the calabiyau space as [11]

where b = abbab and ab = igab is the kahler form. one can expand this (1, 1) form
in terms of eigenfunctions of the calabiyau laplacian as

bab = xi

bii

ab + massive .

(9)

here, we have concentrated on the massless part of this expansion, represented by the
harmonic (1, 1) forms iab of the calabiyau space, where i = 1, . . . , h1,1. the form of
the massive part can be found in [9]. the expansion coecients bi read explicitly

this expression holds in each interval zn  |z|  zn+1 for xed n, where n = 0, . . . , n.
here z = x11/ and zn = xn/ are normalized orbifold coordinates and c4i is a basis of
fourcycles dual to the harmonic (1, 1) forms i. note that the charges sum up to zero
due to the cohomology constraint (5); that is pn +1

to summarize, eqs. (6)(10) represent the (massless part) of the background to linear
order in s, given in terms of the topological charges (n)
. specic consistent models where
these charges can be computed explicitly have been constructed recently [12]. eq. (10)
shows that the calabiyau space is changing its size and shape across the orbifold. this
corresponds to a certain trajectory in the kahler moduli space.

we would now like to discuss some properties of the lowenergy eective actions asso-
ciated to those vacua. interesting new features arise from the new degrees of freedom on
the vebrane worldvolumes. from a single vebrane wrapped on a holomorphic genus
g twocycle within a calabiyau space one obtains an n = 1 theory in four dimensions
with generically g u(1) vector multiplets, one universal chiral multiplet (containing the
position modulus in the orbifold direction) and a number of additional chiral multiplets
parameterizing the moduli space of the curve. in specic cases, the gauge group enhances
and becomes nonabelian. for example, n vebranes, wrapped on the same cycle with
genus g and positioned at dierent points in the orbifold lead to a group u(1)gn . moving
all vebranes to the same orbifold point enhances the group to u(n)g.

the vedimensional eective action of heterotic mtheory obtained by reducing on
the calabiyau space is of some interest as the orbifold size could be large. for standard
embedding, this action consists of a gauged n = 1 supergravity with vector and hyper-
multiplets in the bulk coupled to two fourdimensional n = 1 theories on the orbifold
planes [13]. for the vacua discussed here, the bulk action between each two neighboring
vebranes is again given by gauged supergravity. the gauge charges are directly related
to the charges (n)
in addition to the
two orbifold theories, the bulk is now coupled to n additional fourdimensional n = 1
theories resulting from the vebranes. each of them carries a eld content of the type
discussed above.

and depend on the vebrane pair considered.

upon further reduction to four dimensions, one obtains a theory which consists of the
usual observable and hidden sector originating from e8  e8 and n additional sec-
tors from the vebrane degrees of freedom. in particular, the lowenergy gauge group is
enhanced to g(1)  g(2)  g where g(i) are the unbroken subgroups of e8 and g, being
typically a product of unitary groups, results from the ve branes. in addition to the
existence of new sectors, the conventional e8  e8 sectors are eected by the presence
of the vebranes. the vebrane charges introduce more freedom in the cohomology

condition (5) and, hence, allow for consistent gauge bundles that would otherwise be for-
bidden. among other things, this facilitates the construction of threefamily model [12].
also, the conventional part of the fourdimensional eective action receives new correc-
tions caused by the vebranes. they can be computed in leading order using the above
results for the explicit form of the vacua. for example, the gauge kinetic functions for
g(1) and g(2) take the form

n +1

f (1) = s + st i

xn=0

,

f (2) = s + st i

where s is the dilaton and t i are the t moduli. note the dependence on the vebrane
charges as well as on the positions zn of the vebranes in the orbifold.
