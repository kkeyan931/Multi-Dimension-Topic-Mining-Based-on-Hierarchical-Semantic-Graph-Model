abstract

we consider so(4)  so(6) invariant type iib string solution describing d3-branes su-
perposed with d-instantons homogeneously distributed over d3-brane world-volume. in
the near d3-brane horizon limit this background interpolates between ads5  s5 space
in uv and at space (with non-constant dilaton and rr scalar) in ir. generalizing the
ads/cft conjecture we suggest that type iib string in this geometry is dual to n = 4
sym theory in a state with a constant self-dual gauge eld background. the semiclassical
string representation for the wilson factor implies connement with eective string tension
depending on constant d-instanton density parameter. this provides a simple example of
type iib string  gauge theory duality with clear d-brane and gauge theory interpretation.

1. introduction

recent discovery of a remarkable connection between gravity and gauge theory de-
scriptions of d-branes gives a hope of eventual string-theoretic description of properties
of strongly coupled gauge theories such as connement [1] (see [2] for reviews). the best
understood example of this duality [3,4,5] based on d3-branes relates n = 4 super ym
theory and type iib string in ads5  s5 space. to clarify the meaning of the duality in
the context of type iib string theory and to extend it to non-conformal (and less super-
symmetric) cases one may study various modications of the pure d3-brane background,
in particular:
(i) add extra energy to the branes, i.e. consider near-extremal d3-branes; the correspond-
ing gauge theory is then in a thermal state (see, e.g., [6,7]); (ii) add d7-branes breaking
supersymmetry on the gauge theory side to n = 2 [8,9]; (iii) break supersymmetry com-
pletely by adding dilaton charge [10,11] (or, more generally, exciting other scalar elds in
s5-compactied 5d theory, see [12] and references there).

here we propose another example which is similar to the one in [10,11] in that the
background preserves so(4)so(6) symmetry but is simpler having a clear interpretation
on both supergravity and gauge theory sides. we consider a homogeneous distribution of
d-instantons on a large number of coincident d3-branes. this corresponds to modifying
the d3-brane background by adding a rr scalar charge together with (equal) dilaton
charge in a way that preserves 1/2 of supersymmetry. the resulting supergravity solution
is a limit of superposition [13] of d3-brane [14] and d(-1)-brane [15,16] backgrounds. the
d3+d(-1) conguration is t-dual to d4+d0 or d5+d1 marginal bound state backgrounds
and preserves 1/4 (1/2 near horizon of d3-brane) of supersymmetry.

in the present case the d-instanton charge is homogeneously smeared over the d3-
brane world-volume instead of being localized as in [17].1 the corresponding gauge theory
is not simply the vacuum n = 4 sym theory perturbed by a single instanton (with
perturbations of the supergravity d3-brane and gauge eld backgrounds related as in
[17,19]) but rather is a dierent n = 2 supersymmetric state described by a homogeneous
self-dual gauge eld background. the latter is assumed to be averaged in some way to
preserve the euclidean so(4) invariance. its order parameter (instanton density) is kept
xed in the large n limit.

following [3] we conjecture that the type iib string theory in near-horizon d3+d(-1)
geometry is dual to n = 4 sym theory in such constant self-dual gauge eld background.
this conjecture is consistent with analogous correspondence between the supergravity and

1 a limiting case when d-instanton is put at the center of the euclidean ads5 space but is still
localized in the boundary coordinates and thus corresponds to a very large (i.e., approximately

homogeneous) instanton gauge eld in the boundary sym theory was recently discussed in [18].

1

gauge theory descriptions of d3-branes in at space with additional gauge eld distribu-
tions on them. adding a self-dual gauge eld on a d3-brane in at space is equivalent to
adding d-instanton charge [20,21]. the remaining supersymmetry ensures that the leading
1
x4 f 4 long- and short- distance interaction potentials between branes (computed in classi-
cal supergravity and in one-loop sym theory) agree [22] like they do in the d0-brane case
[23]. this implies that the (smeared) d3+d(-1) supergravity conguration corresponds to
a d3-brane with a (homogeneous) self-dual background gauge eld.

though this example is somewhat unphysical (being based on a euclidean background
which usually has a well-dened meaning only as a virtual conguration in the path in-
tegral) our main motivation is that it provides a clear setting for testing certain aspects
of string theory  gauge theory duality. as in other similar cases [24,10,11,12] here the
background interpolates between a regular uv ads5  s5 space (conformal gauge theory)
and a singular ir background. a remarkable simplication which happens in d3+d(-1)
case (in addition to a transparent analytic form of the supergravity solution) is that the
ir limit of the string-frame metric is actually at,2 with the singularity of the background
residing only in the dilaton eld. assuming the string-theory representation for the wil-
son factor [25] that immediately leads (in the semiclassical approximation) to the area law
behaviour.

this prediction of the string in curved space  gauge theory duality is consistent with
expectations that gauge theory in a constant self-dual background [26,27,28,29] should be
conning. the connement should be simply a consequence of the presence of a non-trivial
background eld (implying, e.g., that propagators do not have poles in the complex energy
plane [29]). we nd that the eective string tension following from the curved space picture
depends indeed only on the background gauge eld order parameter and not on the gauge
coupling.

we shall start in section 2 by presenting the d3+d(-1) supergravity background. the
corresponding gauge theory state described by a self-dual background will be considered
in section 3. the relation between with the supergravity solution and gauge theory state
will be illustrated in section 4 by sym eective action interpretation of the d3-brane
probe action in the d3+d(-1) background. in section 4 we shall use the dual string the-
ory description to compute the wilson factor and demonstrate that it exhibits area law
behaviour. section 5 will contain some concluding remarks. in appendix we shall con-
sider perturbations of the background elds near the d3-brane + d-instanton supergravity
background and demonstrate that scalar eld perturbations do not, in general, decouple
from the metric one. while one linear combination of the dilaton and rr scalar pertur-
bations still satises the massless scalar equation in ads5  s5, the second combination
mixes with graviton and should have complicated dynamics, reecting the presence of the
self-dual gauge eld background on the gauge theory side.

2 the ir limit of the einstein-frame metric is again ads5  s5.

2. dual supergravity picture: d3+d(-1) background

a simple example of a deformation of the d3-brane solution of type iib supergravity
by non-trivial scalar eld backgrounds is obtained by switching on a rr scalar charge and
balancing it by a dilaton charge to preserve 1/2 of supersymmetry. the resulting exact
solution representing a marginal bound state of d3-brane and a (smeared) d-instanton is
a non-trivial example of a type iib brane intersection conguration parametrised by two
harmonic functions. it has the following string-frame metric [13]

ds2

10 = (h1)1/2(h 1/2

3

dxmdxm + h 1/2

3 dxsdxs) ,

(2.1)

where m = 1, ..., 4, s = 5, ..., 10, and h1 and h3 are the harmonic functions depending
only on xs.
in addition to the self-dual 5-form background representing the d3-brane
charge we have the non-trivial dilaton and rr scalar backgrounds3

e0 = h1 ,

c = (h1)1  1 .

(2.2)

this solution is t-dual to d4 + d0 or d5 + d1 congurations. the total stress tensor of
the two scalar elds is zero so that the einstein frame metric remains the same as in the
d3-brane case.

since the d-instanton is smeared over the 3-brane world-volume the two harmonic

functions have the same structure (r2 = xsxs)

euclidean and minkowski versions.

the supergravity approximation applies when derivatives of the elds remain small in

units of , i.e.

  1 ,

r  (q)1/59/10 ,

(2.6)

and when the eective string coupling is small, i.e. r  (q)1/4.

let us now consider the following generalization of the decoupling limits of [31,3,32]

  0 ,

{u =

r
 , , q} = xed .

(2.7)

this limit is equivalent to taking a special solution without 1 in the 3-brane harmonic func-
tion h3 (and making a coordinate redenition). the dilaton and rr scalar are expressed
(2.2) in terms of the function h1 which remains nite in this limit5

10 is still ads5  s5 as in the
the corresponding einstein-frame metric ds2
d3-brane case. as in the pure d3-brane case [3], the factor  cancels out in the classical
string action which thus remains nite in the limit (2.7).

e = e(0)/2ds2

like the ads5  s5 einstein frame metric, the string frame metric (2.9) is completely

regular: near the core r  0 (i.e. in the ir region u  0) it becomes at
1/2

ds2

10 = q1/2(cid:18)dxmdxm + dz2 + z2d2
5(cid:19) ,

(2.10)

note that the overall coecient (eective string tension) is just q1/2, i.e. does not depend
on . the full d3+d(-1) background is, however, singular because of the blow-up of the
dilaton at u = 0. this is the same behaviour as in the case of the pure d-instanton
background [15].

this background (2.9) thus interpolates between ads5  s5 at u =  (uv) and at
space with singular dilaton near u = 0 (ir), while in the absence of d-instantons (q = 0)
the ads5  s5 space describes both regions. the constant instanton density parameter
q breaks conformal invariance in the ir region. similar interpolating backgrounds (with
singular metrics in the ir) were found in [10,11,12]. an attractive feature of the present
case is its simplicity (not unrelated to remaining supersymmetry) and clear identication

5 this limit was considered also by n. itzhaki.

of the corresponding dual gauge theory  n = 4 sym with a constant self-dual background
(section 3). this interpretation is supported by the relation between the classical action
of a d3-brane probe moving in this geometry and the sym one-loop eective action in the
corresponding gauge eld background (see section 4).

the forms of the dilaton and rr scalar (2.2),(2.8) suggest the following expressions

for the ir ow of the sym couplings

(u) = (1 +

q
u4 ) ,

(u) = (1 +

q
u4 )1  1 .

(2.11)

similar power-like running of the dilaton was found also in [10,11]. in the n = 2 gauge
theory related to d7 + d3 brane conguration [8] analogous ir running of dilaton may be
explained by instanton corrections (see [9] and refs. there). here it should be induced by
the presence of a constant self-dual eld condensate.6

the atness of the u  0 limit of the metric suggests that the ir limit of gauge
theory should be described by type iib string theory in at space (with additional dilaton
and rr scalar and 4-tensor backgrounds being invisible in a semiclassical approximation).
that obviously leads to the area law behaviour of the wilson factor (see section 5).

the major question, however, is whether the background (2.9),(2.2),(2.8) may be
extrapolated all the way into the ir region u  0. we expect that due to its remaining
supersymmetry this background, like ads5  s5, is actually an exact (all order in )
solution of the classical type iib string theory. then one may relax the conditions (2.6)
but there is still the condition that the eective string coupling e should remain small,
i.e.

u  u ,

u  (q)1/4 = 2(

k
n v4

)1/4 .

(2.12)

if q is not constrained, we may allow u to be suciently small to probe the ir limit
and still have weak string coupling to ignore string loop corrections. this will be our
assumption below. u  (v4)1/4 may be interpreted as an ir energy cuto on the gauge
theory side.

3. gauge theory picture

the gauge eld theory counterpart of the supergravity solution discussed above is
the n = 4 su (n ) sym theory in a certain (non-vacuum) state which may be de-
scribed as a stochastic averaging of a constant homogeneous self-dual background (see,
e.g., [26,27,28,29]). namely, we shall demand that in such state7

< fmn >= 0 , < tr(fmnfmnfmnf 
6 instanton contributions do not produce ir rg ow in the n = 4 sym theory in the vacuum

< tr(fmnfmn) >=

mn) >= 0 ,

7 here tr is in the fundamental representation, tr(tatb) = 1

2 ab. the classical action is

s = 1

162 r d4x tr(fmnf 

mn) .

5

where a nite volume v4 will be used as an ir cuto. we shall assume that this n = 2
supersymmetric state may obtained by some averaging over dierent 4d directions so that
k is the only order parameter, i.e. that so(4) invariance is unbroken (but p- and t-
invariances are obviously broken). indeed, the supergravity solution has so(4) invariance
and depends only on one extra constant q which is related to k.

for the purpose of comparing with supergravity such state may be represented simply

by (a stochastic averaging of) a constant self-dual abelian background such that

< fmnfmn >=< fmnf

q = 2 < fmnfmn >= const .

(3.2)

(3.3)

(3.4)

again, q will be the only order parameter visible on the supergravity side, i.e. the gauge
theory state is dened by averaging over all elds satisfying fmn = f 

introducing a background eld does not change uv niteness property of the n = 4
sym theory, but may, of course, modify ir behaviour. indeed, the propagators of massless
fermions and o-diagonal gluons in the self-dual background exhibit connement-type
(no-pole) behaviour [29]. the connement on the sym side is caused by the background
eld [28,29]. the dual string/gravity description will lead to an area law for the wilson
factor with eective string tension proportional simply to q (section 5). the supergravity
description also predicts (2.11) that the gauge coupling constants (gym, ) should have
power-like running in the ir.

4. d3 brane probe in d3+d(-1) background and sym eective action

to support the gauge theory interpretation of the above supergravity background
let us consider the action of a d3-brane probe moving in the d3+d(-1) background and
demonstrate its relation to the quantum eective action of n = 4 sym theory. the latter
will be computed in a constant gauge eld background containing self-dual component on
the stack of n d3-branes representing a source and a constant abelian eld on a separated

8 similar averaged gauge eld congurations were discussed in the context of comparing with
supergravity solutions in, e.g., [34,35]. the idea is to engineer a gauge eld background that

has certain global characteristics (energy, momentum, instanton number, etc.) which are the only

parameters present in the supergravity solution.

d3-brane probe (see, e.g., [36,22,34,35,3,37]). we shall choose the static gauge on the
euclidean d3-brane world volume action. then the action for a d3-brane probe moving
in the background (2.9),(2.2),(2.8) and c1234 = u4 takes the form9

this action can indeed be interpreted as a result of integrating out open string modes con-
necting the probe and the source separated by distance u in at space with fmn background
on the probe and a self-dual background parametrized by q on the source. let us assume
that n coinciding d3-branes carry a constant u (1) self-dual background fmn = f 
mn, so
that the total u (n + 1) background is block-diagonal, fmn = diag(fmnin n , fmni11).

where f is the total background eld, u is the eective mass scale set by the separation
between branes and str is the symmetrized trace in the adjoint representation. for a
commuting block-diagonal background f = diag(f , f ) we may simply to replace fmn
by fmn  fmn under the adjoint trace adding the overall factor (number of non-zero
eigenvalues) 2n . then the f 4 term in (4.3) vanishes because of the self-duality of f and

to adding d-instanton charge to the d3-brane probe. this is the expected cancellation of the static
potential between the same-type marginal bound states of branes like d3+d(1) and d3+d(1)
or d4 + d0 and d4 + d0 [38,22].

expression vanishes after averaging over the directions of the self-dual eld f , implying < fmn >=
0. as was already mentioned above, this averaging is necessary in order for the brane source gauge
theory state to represent the so(4) invariant supergravity background. the o(f 4) term in (4.3)
is also reproduced by the f 4 term in the expansion of (4.1).

assuming that fmnfmn = q/2 as in (3.4) and expanding (4.2) in powers of q we nd the
(precise numerical) agreement between the supergravity (4.2) and the sym (4.4) expres-
sions (see [22] for details of similar calculations).12 a non-trivial feature of this example
is that while q and fmn have very dierent interpretation on the supergravity side (one is
a parameter of the background and another is a coordinate of the probe) they have the
same background gauge eld interpretation on the gauge theory side.

5. string representation for the wilson factor

let us now consider a type iib string propagating in the d3+d(-1) supergravity
background and compute, following [25], the potential between far separated quark and
anti-quark (w-bosons) by evaluating the string partition function representation for the
wilson factor in the semiclassical approximation. this amounts to computing the value
of the bosonic nambu string action on the classical string conguration. assuming that
the string penetrates the ir (u = 0) region the atness of the string metric in this region
(2.10) implies that the nambu action will be proportional to the area. this implies the
connement behaviour similar to what is found in the non-extremal (nite temperature)
case [41] and in the case of the dilaton-charge deformed 3-brane solution [11].

we shall take the string action in the form 1

2 r d d det gab and x the static

gauge x0 = , x1 = , where the world-sheet coordinates  and  run from 0 to t and
l/2 to l/2. as in [25], we shall consider a static string solution which has only the radial
coordinate u changing with . the stationary point is found with the boundary condition
that u runs to innity at l/2 and l/2 and takes the minimal value in between. since
the dilaton and rr eld couplings can be ignored in the semiclassical approximation, the
string action is determined simply by the metric (2.9)

(5.2)

(5.3)

since f 2(u)  h11u4 = 1u4 + q has a minimum at u = 0 it follows from the
general analysis of [42] that the action (5.1) leads to connement with the string tension

12 from the d-branes in at space perspective the reason why the supergravity (long-distance)
and sym (short-distance) interaction potentials agree [23] is in the non-renormalization theorem
for f 4 terms [40].

proportional to f (0) = q. the same conclusion follows from the light-ray analogy used
in [11] to argue that for a large separation l the potential is dominated by the minimum
of the refraction index n(z), i.e. by the limit z  (/q)1/4.13

indeed, the large l limit is dominated by the ir region u  0 where the string-frame
metric (2.9) becomes at (2.10), so that the string action (5.2) takes the at-space form

i1  t q1/2

2 z d pz2 + 1 ,

and thus automatically leads to the area-law behaviour of the wilson factor,

w (c)  eteff t l ,

te =

q .

2

(5.4)

(5.5)

an interesting feature is that the eective string tension te does not depend on the
t hooft coupling , but depends only on the background order parameter q (instanton
density). this is consistent with the gauge theory picture (section 3) since connement in
a self-dual gauge eld background should be caused simply by the gauge eld condensate.
in the above discussion we have ignored the fact that near the true minimum of n(z),
i.e. z = , u = 0, the string coupling becomes strong and thus string loop corrections
(higher topologies) may not be, in principle, ignored.14 for large l the string probes the
far ir region where the string coupling is no longer small. a way to avoid this problem
may be to impose the ir cuto (2.12) u  u, i.e. to restrict z to values z  z  (/q)1/4.
then the minimal value of n(z) will be at z = z and the potential will contain additional
dependence on l/z. one may qualitatively approximate the resulting eective string
tension as te = 1

 which reduces to (5.5) in the limit u  0.

6. concluding remarks

our motivation in discussing the above d3-brane + d-instanton background is that
it provides a simple generalization of the gravity  gauge theory correspondence in the
pure d3-brane case. we have seen that the supergravity or string theory description
predicts a (coupling-independent) connement behaviour, essentially because the constant
d-instanton density makes the string-frame metric at in the ir region.

13 note that in contrast to the case discussed in [11] here the eective tension does not depend

on .

14 this problem did not appear in the dilatonic charge solution [10,11] where the supergravity

approximation was still valid near the minimum [11].

this example is dierent from the case of localized d-instantons in ads5  s5 which
correspond to localized ym instantons in the boundary gauge theory [17,19] and are vir-
tual euclidean congurations contributing to path integral and producing non-perturbative
contributions to observables on both sides of the duality correspondence. adding a lo-
calized instanton is a perturbation of the pure d3-brane case, while we interpreted the
homogeneous self-dual gauge eld background as a special n = 2 supersymmetric state of
the n = 4 sym theory.

though this euclidean self-dual background is somewhat articial from physical point
of view, it would be interesting to understand the reason for a power-like ir ow of the
gauge coupling (2.11) from the gauge theory point of view.

the conformal invariance of the n = 4 sym theory is broken by the background
eld density parameter q in a soft way. since the einstein frame metric remains that
of the ads5  s5 space, some of the supergravity modes which do not directly couple to
the dilaton (like the s5-radius mode) do not feel the presence of q, i.e. still satisfy the
same massive ads5 laplace equations as in the pure d3-brane case. the correlators of
the corresponding gauge eld operators (f 4 + ... in the s5 radius case) are thus expected
to be the same as in the vacuum n = 4 sym case. at the same time, the dilaton and
rr scalar modes which satised the massless laplace equation in the pure d3-brane case
no longer do so in the d3+d(-1) background (the correlators of f 2 and f f  operators
are certainly dierent from the vacuum case). since the scalar eld background values are
non-constant, their uctuations mix with each other and also with graviton perturbations.
the corresponding quadratic uctuation action is derived in appendix below. such mixing
should be a general feature of solutions with non-constant dilaton backgrounds, like d4-

[43]) or the solution of [10,11]. possible consequences of the dilaton-graviton
mixing in these cases deserve careful investigation.

appendix a. perturbations of the supergravity background

below we shall study small uctuations of the metric, dilaton and rr scalar elds near
the background (2.2),(2.8),(2.9). the equations for the dilaton and rr scalar perturbations
are in general of interest in connection with spectrum of possible bound states on gauge
theory side [7,43]. the scalar perturbations are not, in general, expected to decouple from
the metric perturbations in the case of non-constant scalar background as we illustrate
below on the present d3+d(-1) example.

we start with the d = 5 einstein-frame lagrangian for the metric-dilaton-axion

system (c = ic; ,  = 1, ..., 10)

l =pg(cid:2) r 

1
2

and expand the elds near their background values

g (    e2  c c)(cid:3) ,

(a.1)

 =  +  ,

c = c + e ,

g = g + h .

(a.2)

the background elds  and c satisfy (here we set 0 = 0, cf.(2.2))

c = e ,

ed2e = d2 + ()2 = 0 ,

(a.3)

where d is the covariant derivative depending on the background metric g . the
einstein-frame metric in (2.9) is that of the ads5  s5 space.
part of l (we omit the pure graviton h2 part)

expanding to the second order in uctuation elds we get for the  and  dependent

l2 = g(cid:20)h [(+)  (+)]()2+2()22+()2+4 (cid:21) , (a.4)

where

h  h

gh,

h = gh .

following [44] we choose the dieomorphism gauge xing term to be

lg.f. = 

1
2

g g[dh

   ( + )][dh

   ( + )]

 + d h  ( + ) 
the ,  dependent part of the gauge-xed lagragian is then

()2 ( + )2(cid:21) .

(a.6)

note that because of the classical equation for  (a.3) the trace of h does not actually
couple to  and .

using the explicit form of the background einstein-frame metric and the dilaton (see

(2.2),(2.8),(2.9))

ds2

e =

1
z2 (dxmdxm + dz2 + z2d5) ,

e0 = 1 +

qz4


,

(a.7)

we get for the coupling function in the graviton  ( + ) mixing term

  + dd  = zz[2

z  + z1z + (z)2]  z1mnz .

(a.8)

this function is non-vanishing, so there is a non-trivial mixing between  +  and the
traceless part of h .

introducing

we may rewrite (a.6) as

 =    ,

l

2 = g(cid:20)+

1
2

()22

+2+  + ( +dd ) h +(cid:21) . (a.9)

then the equations of motion for  and + are

d2+  2+  2d2 + = 0 ,
d2 + 2 + ()2+ + (  + dd )h = 0 .

using (a.3) the equation for + can be written also as

d2(e+) = 0 ,

(a.10)

(a.11)

i.e. the eld e+ satises the massless scalar equation in the ads5  s5 space.

since the elds  and c couple to the boundary gauge theory operators as

lint(, c) = etr(fmnfmn)  ctr(fmnf 

mn) ,

(a.12)

their perturbations couple as

lint( + ,c + e) = lint(, c)  e(cid:2)  tr(fmnfmn) +  tr(fmnf 
= lint(, c)  e+ tr(f (+)

mn )  e tr(f ()

mn f (+)

mn)(cid:3) + ...

mn f ()

mn ) + ... ,

(a.13)

12

where

f ()
mn

(fmn  f 

mn) .

in interpreting this expression we should take into account that + and  are conjugate
to each other like light-cone variables (cf. the kinetic term in (a.9)). thus the term that
couples to + is actually the source for  and vice versa.
in view of (a.11) we then
conclude that the operator tr(f ()
mn ) is still counterpart of a massless mode in the
ads5 space. this is perfectly consistent with the fact that the background gauge eld
corresponding to the supergravity solution satises (3.1), < tr(f ()
mn ) >= 0, i.e. does
not have a condensate.

mn f ()

the second eld  is non-trivially coupled to the graviton and thus has more compli-
mn ) should feel the presence

cated dynamics, reecting the fact that the operator tr(f (+)
of the gauge eld background.
