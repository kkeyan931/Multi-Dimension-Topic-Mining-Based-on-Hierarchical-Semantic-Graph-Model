abstract

these lectures do not at all provide a general review of this rapidly growing eld.
instead a rather detailed account is presented of a number of the most elementary
aspects.

based on lectures presented at quantum aspects of gauge theories, supersymmetry
and unication, school in leuven, january 18-23, 1999; and on lectures presented at
nordic course on duality in string and field theories, 4-14 august, 1998, nordita,
copenhagen. lecture notes prepared with the help of troels harmark.

1 introduction

the maldacena conjecture [1] is a conjecture concerning string theory or m theory on certain
backgrounds of the form adsd  mdd. here adsd is an anti de sitter space of space-time
dimension d, and mdd is a certain compactication space of dimension d d with d = 10 for
string theory and d = 11 for m theory. in addition, the background is specied by a statement
about the ux of a certain eld strength dierential form. the conjecture asserts that the
quantum string- or m-theory on this background is mathematically equivalent - or dual as the
word goes - to an ordinary but conformally invariant quantum eld theory in a space-time of
dimension d  1, which in fact has the interpretation of the boundary of adsd. this seems
to put the formulation of string/m-theory on a novel and rather unexpected footing. also
the relation between quantum and classical theory is illuminated in a surprising way by the
conjecture. several details in maldacenas original formulation were left unspecied. most of
those were subsequently given a precise formulation by independent works of gubser, klebanov
and polyakov [2] and by witten [3]. a priori it might seem very strange that quantum theories
in dierent space-time dimensions could be equivalent. this possibility is related to the fact
that the theory in the larger dimension is (among other things) a quantum theory of gravity.
for such theories the concept of holography has been introduced as a generic property, and the
maldacena conjecture is an example of the realization of that (for discussion, see for example
[4]).

in the meantime a large number of checks have been performed which we shall not attempt
to review in these notes (for some recent reviews with many additional references, see for
example [5, 6, 7, 8]). supposing the conjecture is true, it remains somewhat unclear what the
most signicant consequence will be. on the one hand the conjecture allows one to obtain non
perturbative information on ordinary, but mostly conformally invariant quantum eld theories,
especially at large n (of a gauge group u(n)), from classical string/m-theory or even classical
supergravity. this is a remarkable unexpected development, and the one that has mostly
been pursued until now. on the other hand it is conceivable that the conjecture will play an
important role in the eventual non-perturbative formulation of m-theory, for which the matrix
model of bfss [9] was a rst proposal. in a somewhat dierent line of development, witten
[10] showed how to apparently overcome the original restriction to conformally invariant (and
mostly supersymmetric) quantum eld theories, providing in fact an entirely new framework
for studying large n ordinary qcd and similar theories. a rather new idea about how to
achieve the same end in perhaps a more ecient way has recently appeared [11]. that approach,
however will not be covered here at all (see also [5]). in any case, the ads/cft development
attracts an enormous interest.

in these lectures we shall attempt a very elementary introduction to a somewhat restricted
number of basic aspects. in sect. 2 we begin by reviewing properties of anti de sitter spaces,
their isometries, the fact that they may be associated with a boundary and the fact that
the isometry group of anti de sitter space becomes the conformal group on the boundary. it
follows that if a quantum theory on anti de sitter space is dual to another quantum theory on
the boundary, then that second theory must necessarily be conformal.

in sect. 3 we expand on the discussion in [1] and provide a short review of classical super-
gravity solutions in the presence of branes. both so called extremal (bps) and non-extremal

1

solutions will be considered for later reference. this subject has already been reviewed on nu-
merous occasions (see for example [12, 13, 14, 15]). we describe how the so called near horizon
approximation in some cases lead to geometries of the form adsd  sdd. this fact has been
known for several years by the experts, but its full signicance was only realized by maldacena.
in sec. 4 we follow rather closely [3] and describe in detail several instructive albeit rather
trivial examples of how the duality between the bulk theory and the boundary theory works in
the case of free theories. an important object which has a general signicance is the generalized
propagator describing propagation of certain modes from a space-time point in the bulk of anti
de sitter space to a point on the boundary. this propagator was the key object in the
discussions in [2, 3] and will be constructed in a few of the simplest cases. at the same time
the maldacena conjecture will be made more precise.

in sect. 5 we follow [10] and describe how certain nite temperature scenarios may be used
to provide a mechanism for breaking conformal invariance and supersymmetry, and thereby
obtain a framework for studying large n qcd.

2 elementary properties of anti de sitter spaces

we begin by considering the einstein-hilbert action with a cosmological term.

(1)

s = s

1

16gd z ddxp|g|(r + )

we consider (rst) minkowski metric with s = 1, and we take it to be mostly plus. we
shall also consider euclidean signature, s = +1. notice that the sign of the action ips if we
go from a mostly plus to a mostly minus metric. anti de sitter space (ads) as well as de
sitter space are solutions of the empty space einstein equation:

r 

1
2

gr =

r =

r =

1
2

g 
d
 
2  d
g
2  d



(2)

so these spaces have the property that the ricci tensor is proportional to the metric tensor:
they are einstein spaces. we shall be interested in various examples of such spaces, in particular
in ones with maximal symmetry, for which in addition we have

r =

r

d(d  1)

(gg  gg)

(3)

such spaces are (for r 6= 0): spheres, sd, de sitter spaces, dsd, and anti de sitter spaces,
adsd. the dierence between de sitter space and anti de sitter space is the sign of the
cosmological constant. with the above conventions, ads spaces have  > 0 (see below).

2

2.1 adsn+1 by embedding

it is useful to consider an (n + 1)-dim adsn+1 as a submanifold of a pseudo-euclidean (n + 2)-
dimensional embedding space with coordinates (ya) = (y0, y1, ..., yn, yn+1) and metric

with length squared

ab = diag(+,,, ...,, +)

n

y2  (y0)2 + (yn+1)2 

(yi)2

xi=1

preserved by the lorentz-like group so(2, n) (with two times) acting as

ya  ya = a

byb, a

b  so(2, n)

a possible denition of adsn+1 is then as the locus of

y2 = b2 = const.

(4)

(5)

for de sitter spaces we would use a mostly plus metric and the same denition (or equiv-
alently, b2  b2) and similarly for the spherical spaces, for which of course the metric is
positive denite. we shall demonstrate below that this implies eq.(3).
if instead of adsn+1 we consider the n + 1 dimensional minkowski space, we know that our
theory should be invariant under the poincare group, which in n + 1 dimensions has dimension
n+1 (for the translations) plus 1
2(n+1)(n+2).
in fact the poincare group is exactly the isometry group of at space:
invariant intervals,
squared, are preserved by the poincare group. with the denition of adsn+1 just given, it is
obvious that the isometry group of that space instead is so(2, n). in fact, let ya
0 + dya
(1)
0 + dya
(2) be 3 points lying in the submanifold given by eq.(5), and let ya
and ya
(1)
and ya
(2) be the corresponding images under the so(2, n) transformation eq.(4). clearly
these also lie in adsn+1, and in particular we have

2n(n+1) (for the lorenz transformations) in total 1

0 + dya
0 + dya

0, ya
0, ya

dy(1)  dy(2) = dy

(1)  dy

(2)

(6)

where for any vectors in (n + 2)-dimensional pseudo-euclidean space

x  y  abxayb
since the vectors dya
(2) are all vectors in adsn+1, this proves that the metric
on adsn+1 inherited from that of the embedding space, is so(2, n) invariant. it follows that
quantum theories on adsn+1 should have an so(2, n) invariance. clearly the dimension of that
group is (the same as the dimension of so(n + 2)) 1
2(n + 1)(n + 2). so the invariance group
for theories on ads is just a large as for theories on a at space of the same dimensionality.

2.1.1 polar/stereographic coordinates

introduce coordinates (x) = (x1, ..., xn+1) on adsn+1 by

where

y = 

y0 = 

1 + x2
1  x2
2x
1  x2 ,  = 1, ..., n + 1
x2  (x1)2 + ... + (xn)2  (xn+1)2

(7)

(9)

(10)

we may think of the set (, x) as a possible set of coordinates on the (n + 2)-dimensional
embedding space. clearly y2 = 2 and ads is  = b. the metric in the embedding space is
(convention: mostly minus)

ds2 = (dy0)2 + (dyn+1)2  d~y2

(8)

where d~y = (dy1, ..., dyn). from this we may work out the metric in x coordinates. we
get (notation:  = 1, ..., n + 1 and we raise and lower  by the at minkowski metric
diag(+, +, ..., +,))

dy0 = d

dy = d

1 + x2

2x

1  x2 + 4
1  x2 +

xdx
(1  x2)2
2
(1  x2)2{(1  x2)

 + 2xx}dx

then work out

ds2 = d2 

42

(1  x2)2 dx2

we see that in these coordinates the metric factorizes into a trivial radial part and an inter-
esting (angular) ads part:

(convention: mostly plus).

g = +

4b2

(1  x2)2 

(11)

we now want to verify that this metric indeed satises the einstein equation in vacuum

eq.(2) with a cosmological term:

and determine the constant in terms of the dimension d = n + 1 and the ads-scale, b. we
shall do even more, and verify that the spaces also satisfy the maximal symmetry condition,
eq.(3).

let us in fact consider a general conformally at metric of the form

in our case

g(x) = e(x)

(x) = log 4b2  2 log(1  x2)

(notice that under a shift in convention g  g, i.e. mostly plus  mostly minus,
r is unchanged, so the cosmological term will appear with the opposite sign.)

use this to provide yet another derivation of 13.

we shall also need to consider the case of euclidean signature or imaginary times. then

dx2 =

(dx)2

n+1

x=1

5

in such coordinates the euclidean version of adsn+1 is topologically the ball bn+1

(x)2 < 1

n+1

x=1

the boundary of the ball lies innitely far away as measured in the ads metric. we shall
come back to that.

exercise: in the euclidean case, adsn+1 may be viewed as the hyperbola

where

(y0)2  r2 = b2

n+1

(y)2

r2 

x=1

denoting the point (y0, r) = (b, 0) as the south pole, show that the coordinates x eq.(7)
(euclidean version) are the stereographic projections of adsn+1 from the south pole to the
equatorial plane y0 = 0 (in units of b).

now dene light cone coordinates

or for euclidean signature where the euclidean adsn+1 is the locus of

u = y0 + iyn+1, v = y0  iyn+1

with isometry group so(1, n + 1),

y2
e  (y0)2  (yn+1)2  ~y2 = b2

so that in both cases

u = y0 + yn+1, v = y0  yn+1

y2 = uv  ~y2 = b2

we consider in turn various coordinates on adsn+1 and the corresponding metrics.
the rst set is the one used for example by maldacena in [1]. dene

 (ds2)adsn+1 = +

b2du2
u2  u2d~2 (y2  b2)
b2du2
u2 + u2d~2 (mostly plus)

the second set is similar to poincare coordinates on the projective plane. for simplicity

(20)

put b  1 and use the set

then log u =  log 0 and du

(0, ~)  (u1, ~)

0 . hence

u =  d0

(0)2 +

ds2 =

d~2
(0)2 =

1

(0)2 (cid:16)(d0)2 + d~2(cid:17)

(21)

this is one of the forms used by witten, [3].

2.2 the boundary of adsn+1

anti de sitter space has a kind of projective boundary. the idea is in embedding space to
consider (y0, y) very large with y  adsn+1. hence dene new variables

and take r  . then

so the boundary is somehow the manifold

ya = rya, u = ru, v = rv

y2 = b2  uv  ~y

= b2/r2  0

2

2

uv  ~y

= 0

(22)

(23)

(24)

but since tr is just as good as r for any t  r, we have to consider the boundary to be the
projective equivalence classes

uv  ~y2 = 0
(u, v, ~y)  t(u, v, ~y)

(25)

so the boundary is n-dimensional  as it should be. using the equivalence scaling, the boundary
may be considered to be represented by (minkowski signature)

(y0)2 + (yn+1)2 = 1 = ~y2

(26)

7

so that topologically the boundary is s1  sn1.
in another use of scaling, for points with
v 6= 0 we may scale to v = 1. then u = ~y2 and we may use ~y as coordinates on the boundary.
equivalently, if also u 6= 0 we may instead scale u to 1 and use coordinates ~y and have v = ~y
.
clearly the connection between the two sets is

2

~y =

~y
y2

(27)

when either v = 0 or u = 0, only one of the two sets may be used. for v = 0, ~y = ~0
whereas for u = 0, ~y = ~0. we may think of the (one) point v = 0 as the point at innity
in the ~y coordinates, and similarly for u = 0. so the boundary is automatically compactied.
the situation is analogous to compactifying the riemann sphere including the point z = 
with z a good coordinate in a neighbourhood of z = 0, and  = 1/z a good coordinate in a
neighbourhood of z = .
the above denition of adsn+1 and its boundary in terms of the embedding space, implies
that the isometry group so(2, n) (so(1, n + 1) for euclidean signature) acts in an obvious way
on points of the boundary. the crucial result on which we would like to elaborate, is that the
isometry group so(2, n) (so(1, n + 1)) acts on the boundary as the conformal group acting on
minkowski (euclidean) space.

2.3 the conformal group

for deniteness, consider n-dimensional euclidean space en. we rst want to understand that
the conformal group is so(1, n + 1). begin by counting the number of generators = number
of generators in so(n + 2) = number of linearly independent antisymmetric (n + 2)  (n + 2)
matrices

dimso(1, n + 1) =

(n + 2)(n + 1)

(28)

by comparison, the poincare group in n dimensions has n translation generators and 1
rotation generators

2n(n 1)

dim poincare(en) =

n(n + 1)

(29)

so the dierence is n + 1. this just ts with the following extra possible conformal transfor-
mations:
dilations

gives one generator and
the special conformal transformations

~x  ~x,   r

~x  ~x such that
x
x2 =

x
x2 + 

(30)

(31)

involve the n parameters ,  = 1, ..., n and give rise to the additional n generators. equiva-
lently we may write

1
2

1
2

x =

x + x2

1 + 2~  ~x + 2x2

8

(32)

the equivalence between eq.(31) and eq.(32) follows after noting (from eq.(32)) that

to verify that these are really conformal transformations, consider 3 neighbouring points

x2 =

x2

1 + 2~  ~x + 2x2

(33)

and their images

~x, ~x + d~x1, ~x + d~x2

~x, ~x + d~x

1, ~x + d~x
2

the statement that the transformation is conformal, is the statement that the angles are pre-
served, or

but eq.(31) implies

(34)

(35)

(38)

and the claim follows.

now we want to show that the action of so(1, n + 1) on boundary points give conformal
transformations. a point in adsn+1: (u, v, ~y) with uv  ~y2 = b2 is mapped by so(1, n + 1) to
(u, v, ~y) as

~y 
 ,
where   so(1, n + 1) i.e.  preserves the norm uv  ~y2.

and one checks that uv  ~y
now, choose a representative (u, v, ~y) for a boundary point with v = 1, u = ~y2. (this can
always be done except for v = 0 corresponding to a point at innity on the boundary.) we
have seen that with this representation, ~y is a convenient representation of the boundary point.
now, the image point according to eq.(39) is not in the same convention: v
6= 1 in general.
but the image point is equivalent to (u/v, 1, ~y/v), which is in the same convention. thus,
the eect of the mapping is

in agreement with the above, i.e. indeed we nd in this case the (innitesimal) special conformal
transformations.

this completes the main result in this section that so(1, n + 1) (and so(2, n) in the
minkowski case) acts (i) as an isometry on adsn+1 and (ii) as the conformal group on the
boundary of adsn+1.

2.4 the conformal algebra

for completeness let us work out the lie algebra of the conformal group. we choose the simplest
possible representation, which is in terms of scalar elds (x) with ~x an n-tuple of cartesian
coordinates. it is trivial to check that the generators are represented as follows:
translations p = i
(lorentz-)rotations m = i(x  x) = (xp  xp)
dilations d = ix
special conformal transformations k = i(2xx    x2) = 2xd + x2p

one then easily nds:

[m, p] = i(gp  gp)
[m, m ] = i (g m + gm  gm  g m)
[m, k] = i(gk  gk)

[d, p] = +ip
[d, k] = ik
[p, k] = 2i(gd + m)

(46)

all others zero.

3 the maldacena conjecture

3.1 on dp-branes and other p-branes.

in this section we rst briey review the construction of solitonic p-branes in low energy eective
supergravity. there are many excellent reviews available, for example. refs. [12, 13, 16, 14] to
which we refer for more details and references to the extensive original literature. we begin by
writing down the eective low energy string action for type ii (a or b) strings in the string
frame:

ss = s

16g10 z d10xp|g| e2(r + 4g)

(47)

(s = 1(+1) for minkowski (euclidean) signature, ipping to mostly minus signature intro-
duces an additional sign of ()n in front of f 2
n )). here the dots represent fermionic terms as
well as the ns-ns 3-form eld strength term.  is the dilaton, and the n-form eld strengths
fn belong to the rr sector. for the newton constant in d dimensions we write

16gd = 22
d

we shall only be concerned with the terms given. for iia strings (iib strings) we only have
even (odd) values of n. for the iib string the n = 5 eld strength tensor is self-dual (in
minkowski space, see below), and it is not strictly speaking possible to describe the theory by
the simple action above. a more complicated formulation nonetheless exists [17]. however, it
turns out to be sucient to adopt the above action for deriving the equations of motions, and
imposing self-duality a posteriori (making sure that the normalization of f 2
5 is unchanged). we
shall therefore employ that procedure. it is convenient for various reasons to also represent
the action for elds in the einstein frame, obtained by a certain weyl rescaling. in fact the
following identity in d space-time dimensions may be veried [18]

g  e2g 

p|g|e2r  p|g|e((d2)+2){r + 2(d  1)

2(d  1)(d  2)()2}

we may therefore choose

we shall also be concerned with low-energy m-theory in the form of 11-dimensional super
gravity. the bosonic elds of that theory are just the metric and a 3-form gauge potential c
with a 4-form eld strength tensor

we shall be interested in classical solutions of the above theories, specically in the ones
describing dp-branes. we shall consider static solutions corresponding to at translationally
invariant p-branes, isotropic in transverse directions. for such solutions the last term in eq.(51)
will vanish. hence one is able to cover all cases by considering the generic action

be the case. the bianchi identity for fn is

[1f2...n+1] = 0

(63)

our p-brane ansatz makes use of coordinates

z = (t, xi, ya),  = 0, ..., d  1;
a metric respecting the symmetries is

only. also d2
d1 is the metric on the unit sphere sd1 in the transverse space. there is a gauge
freedom which may be disposed of by putting f = g or g = 1 or something else. we shall
leave it for the time being in order to nd a convenient form of the solutions in which we shall
be interested. it is furthermore part of the p-brane ansatz to require, that the metric should
tend to a at value at r  , i.e. that all the coecients b, c, f, g should tend to 1 in that
limit.
a p + 1 form gauge potential couples naturally to the world volume of the dp brane. the
resulting p + 2 form eld strength tensor is termed electric. however, we shall also need the
magnetic possibility, which is a consequence of an electric/magnetic duality in the problem. in
fact, dening

fdn = ea  fn

(66)

and using the hodge duality relations of the previous subsection, it is possible to verify that
the equations of motions are invariant under the duality transformations:

we see already here, that in order for the metric to reduce to a form similar to adsqsdq, the
riemann tensor in each sub space has to be proportional to the metric tensor, and a necessary
condition therefore is that the dilaton decouples and becomes a constant (in particular, zero).
this requires either n = 5 i.e. iib string theory and ads5 s5, or m-theory (or 11-dimensional
supergravity) where 2-branes and 5-branes are possible corresponding to ads4s7 or ads7s4.

in the magnetic case the solutions are obtained by the above duality relations eq.(67). for the
5-form in iib string theory we replace f5  f5 + f5.
the above solutions are not the most general ones, but represent a 2-parameter sub-family
of solutions. for r0 = 0 we have f  1 and we obtain the extremal solution, depending only
on a single parameter, q related to the common mass and charge density of the bps d-brane.
for r0 6= 0 a horizon develops at r = r0.

thus we are seeking a 2-parameter solution to be represented in a suitable form by some

g(cid:19) = cf log f

with cb and cf constants to be sought for. further dene

3.5 the extremal, non-dilatonic solutions. the near horizon ap-

proximation

the extremal solution is obtained by putting r0 = 0. it corresponds to the brane being in the
ground state in a quantum description. the non-extremal solution (presumably) represents
excitations, corresponding to a denite temperature. in the extremal case we further consider
the case with no dilaton coupling. we have already identied the relevant cases as

for these values, fortuitously one has the accidental identity

(d, n) = (10, 5), (11, 4), (11, 7)

 = (p + 1)(d  2) = 2(d  2)

we now want to consider n coincident branes. for a single extremal dp brane, the ux as
normalized in eq.(74) is given by [20, 16]

where the p-brane tension and newtons constant are given by

(99)

(100)

in fact in 11-dimensional supergravity, almost the same formulas apply, with an obvious change
in dimensionality, but with the understanding that gs is absent (say gs  1 in 11 dimensions).
with this somewhat vulgar notation, we may write

tp =

16gd =

(101)

the length  is the string length 2

exactly have the metric of ads5(l)  s5(l) where we have indicated the length parameter,
l = b, of ads5 and and the radius l of s5. when s  0 the metric has to be rescaled to get
a nite result - by removing the 2

3.6 the brane theory and the maldacena conjecture

from the discussion in the previous section we know that iib string theory on ads5 compactied
on s5 or m-theory on ads4 compactied on s7 or nally on ads7 compactied on s4, are
all quantum theories with isometry groups (for minkowski signature) so(2, 4), so(2, 3) and
so(2, 6) respectively. the remarkable maldacena conjecture [1] is that these various quantum
theories are exactly mathematically equivalent to (dual to) certain quantum theories on the
boundary of the relevant ads spaces, i.e. on the coincident branes.

what could these brane theories be? they would have to be conformally invariant quantum
eld theories according to the discussion in the previous section. and in particular for the case

of ads5  s5 the argumentation is perhaps not too far fetched. the important point is that
we have seen that what we are looking at, is a small portion of space-time very close to the
branes, and then subsequently blown up by formally letting   0. but in precisely that limit
we think we know what the eective quantum theory on the n coincident d3-branes should
be [19]: it should be n = 4 super yang mills with gauge group u(n). (for references on
d-branes, see [20, 21]).

let us try a heuristic argumentation: excitations of d-branes may be thought of in terms
of open strings with end-points on the d-branes. we are dealing with iib string theory which
is a theory of oriented strings, and there are n dierent branes for the strings to end on,
so these open strings are automatically equipped with chan-paton labels relevant to u(n).
they interact with each other, but in the singular limit,   0 we consider, only the zero-
mass modes need be considered, and in 10-dimensions they form the n = 1 multiplet of pure
super yang-mills (for gauge group u(n)). also, as has been known since the middle 1970ies
[22], they interact exactly according to that theory, the gauge coupling being related to the
open string coupling go
s and . for a given feynman-diagram, the corresponding open-string-
diagram will have boundaries, which come with a natural orientation, because the string is
oriented (the string connects two boundaries and is oriented, so the two boundaries are dierent:
have opposite orientations). further the dierent boundaries have labels i = 1, ..., n equal to
the label of the d3-brane. thus the open string-diagram has an appearance identical to the
(super) yang-mills feynman-diagram in the t hooft double line representation for u(n). in 10
dimensions such a string theory is anomalous, but here we are considering end points restricted
to the d-branes and there is no such problem.

in our case, however, the zero-mass particles are conned strictly to the 4-dimensional world
volume of the coincident d3 branes. hence the theory is naturally 10-dim sym dimensionally
reduced to 4 dimensions, and that is exactly the n = 4 sym theory mentioned above. the
sym-coupling gy m is essentially the open string coupling constant which is itself the square
root of the closed iib string coupling constant. more precisely for n p-branes:

g2
y m
4

= gs(2s)p3

(in a suitable normalization). the dimensionality is the well known one.

ibi = tpt r(z dp+1xrdet(cid:16)g + 22

2f(cid:17))

(121)

here, for the gauge group u(n), f is treated as an n  n matrix, but the det refers only
to the (p + 1)  (p + 1) index structure of indices . the interpretation of the determinant
in this case is via the symmetrized trace, denoted by t r above. however, in the calculation
needed here, only an expansion to 2nd order is required, and no ambiguity exists. so for a

from the perspective of the 4-dim. eld theory, n is the n of the gauge group u(n). from
the perspective of iib string theory on ads5  s5, n is the ux (normalized carefully as in
eq.(102)) through s5.
so, the remarkable conjecture is that iib quantum string theory on ads5 compactied on
s5 is identically equivalent to the quantum eld theory in 4 dimensions. let us collect a number
of points in favour of this hypothesis. we shall try to compare properties of the two quantum
theories: (i) iib string theory on ads5  s5 with n units of 5-form ux through s5 - to be
referred simply as iib; and (ii) n = 4 super-yang-mills with gauge-group u(n) in 4 dimensions
- to be referred to simply as sym.

first compare global symmetries. the iib-theory has an isometry group so(2, 4)  so(6)
with the last so(6) being the isometry group of the 5-sphere. actually, because spinors are
involved the relevant groups for ads5 and the sphere, s5 are the covering groups su(4) of
so(6) and su(2, 2) of so(2, 4), so we have su(2, 2)  su(4). but the 32 majorana spinor
supercharges of the iib theory (which are all preserved in this background) transform under
this symmetry in such a way that in fact the full invariance is given by the lie-supergroup
su(2, 2|4).
now we should try to understand that this is also the relevant invariance to consider for the
sym. we have already understood that the so(2, 4) or su(2, 2) part is realized as a conformal
invariance.
indeed the sym is known to have vanishing beta-function and be conformally
invariant. how about so(6) (or su(4))? does the sym theory know about the 5-sphere? yes,
indeed. that is the r-symmetry of sym. in fact, consider briey the eld content of sym:

in 10 dimensions, n = 1 pure super yang-mills contains the gauge eld potentials a,  =
0, 1, ..., 9 (the gluons) giving 10 2 = 8 bosonic physical degrees of freedom, all in the adjoint
representation of the u(n). further we have the 8-dimensional majorana-weyl gluinos
,  = 1, ..., 8, also all in the adjoint representation. the theory has 16 majorana supercharges
q,  = 1, ..., 16. under dimensional reduction, the gluon elds turn into 4  2 = 2 gauge
elds and a remaining 6 scalar elds, 1, ..., 6. the gluino elds turn into 4  2 weyl spinors
in 4 dimensions, a
 ,  = 1, 2, a = 1, 2, 3, 4. an n = 1 description in 4 dimensions put one of
these spinors together with the gauge eld in a gauge supereld, and the remaining 3 spinors
each combine with a pair of scalars to give 3 scalar chiral superelds. the 16 supercharges turn
into 4 sets of complex majoranas qa
 ,  = 1, 2, a = 1, 2, 3, 4 transforming as a {4} and
a {4} of the r-symmetry group su(4), and the i transform as a {6} (the fundamental rep.
of so(6) or the antisymmetric rank 2 tensor under su(4)), so we see that so(6) (or su(4))
is indeed present.

 , qa

but the iib theory had 32 fermionic supercharges, the sym only 16.

indeed from the
perspective of the n coincident bps d3-branes, half the iib supersymmetries are broken. in
any case, where are the remaining 16 fermionic generators? the answer is that they arise as
part of an extension of the conformal group that takes place when supersymmetry is present
as described in the famous paper by haag, lopuzanski and sohnius [23]. for completeness let
us give here their form of the superconformal algebra:

now has the 16 new fermionic generators

[k , qa

(125)

the r-symmetry su(4) generators, t ab, commute with the supersymmetry generators in a
way dictated by the fact that these transform as a fundamental and and anti-fundamental
4-dimensional multiplet under r. some of the remaining commutation relations are

(126)

indeed the combination of eq.(46) and eq.(126) together with the standard n = 4 supersym-
metry algebra constitute the lie super-algebra su(2, 2|4).
it is well known that the iib theory (almost certainly) contains a (non-perturbative) sl(2, z)
invariance [24]. it is best viewed as arising from compactication of m-theory on a 2-torus with
modular parameter

with  the rr-scalar of iib (the axion). in n = 4 super yang-mills there is a corresponding
sl(2, z) invariance of the theory with modular parameter in this case

in this latter case the symmetry is represented by an sl(2, z) transformation of the lattice of
electric and magnetic charges in that theory: q + ig = gy m (ne +  nm) by treating (ne, nm) as
a doublet.

this nishes our very brief comparison of symmetries of the two theories.

the t hooft coupling relevant to large n yang-mills theory. thus, it is tempting in particular
to consider the limit  xed while n  . we see that in this limit the string coupling tends
to zero, so that we may perform calculations on the string theory side, simply by restricting
ourselves to string tree-diagrams, the classical limit of string theory! the full quantum non-
perturbative description of n = 4 super yang-mills would be obtained from this classical theory
- in the large n limit. this seems like a program which might have some success eventually,
even though the ns-r formulation of iib string theory on the ads5  s5 background with n
units of rr 5-form ux is unknown (for a preliminary attempt, see [25]). in the green-schwarz-
formulation there is a proposal [26], [27], but non-trivial calculations remain to be performed.
in any case, this looks like a concrete proposal for the so called master-eld idea of witten,
that the large-n u(n) yang-mills theory path integral could be described by a single eld
conguration, reminiscent indeed of classical theory.

the situation becomes even more astonishing if we furthermore consider the strong coupling
limit, i.e. large  limit of sym. if we keep the ads/sphere radii xed, we are therefore dealing
with the 2
s =   0 limit of string theory, or in other words, with the limit in which classical
string theory simply becomes classical supergravity! this is the limit mostly considered in
concrete calculations so far. even in that extreme limit the conjecture has dramatic predictions:
it predicts how the sym theory at large n behaves in the extreme non-perturbative, strong
coupling regime. string excitations become innitely heavy and decouple in that limit, but
since we kept the radius of the sphere s5 xed, we cannot at all neglect the kaluza-klein
states associated with the compactication on that sphere. (strictly speaking one cannot send
the dimensionful string length to zero. what one means by this is to consider energy scales
for which string excitations may be neglected. if we consider the string length xed and still
take  large, the radius of s5 tends to innity. people often phrase the situation that way.
then all curvatures are small and quantum gravity corrections may be neglected: classical
supergravity is adequate. kk-masses now become very small. obviously the situation is entirely
equivalent to our formulation, but as usual one properly has to consider dimensionless ratios
for such arguments to make sense.)

4 a detailed specication of the conjecture. sample

calculations.

4.1 presentation of the idea

maldacena conjectured an equivalence - a duality - between two theories: (i) string/m-theory
on a manifold of the form adsd  m, with m being a compactication manifold, and (ii) an
appropriate conformal eld theory on the boundary of adsd. but his conjecture did not specify
the precise way in which these two theories should be mapped onto each other. subsequently
a detailed proposal was made independently by gubser, klebanov and polyakov [2] and by
witten [3]. here we shall describe that and carry out several sample calculations considered in
ref. [3] lling in a few details (while leaving several aspects of [2, 10] untreated). for deniteness
of presentation we would think of the canonical ads5  s5 example, but in fact the discussion
will be much more general, ignoring mostly the details of the compactication manifold.
on the boundary theory of n-dimensional minkowski (or euclidean) space-time, we should

typically like to understand a general correlator of the the form

ho1(x1)...oq(xq)i

one wants to know how to obtain the same object in terms of the quantum theory on adsn+1.
the proposal of [2] and [3] is to identify this object with the result of a path integral in the
adsn+1 theory, with certain elds attaining specic boundary properties. the elds in question
would be related to the corresponding boundary theory operators oi(xi) by the requirement
that their boundary values - to be identied in a non-trivial way - should couple to the operators
in a way consistent with the symmetries of the problem. in practice the resulting path integral
might be evaluated by means of generalized feynman diagrams with q external propagators
ending on the boundary at points xi. in particular in the large n limit, as we have seen,
the feynman diagrams would be tree diagrams only, albeit string tree diagrams in general. if
furthermore we consider the limit of large t hooft coupling, the string tree diagrams become
tree diagrams of supergravity. we shall need to understand how to evaluate these general-
ized propagators. a particularly neat formulation is possible if we can construct a standard
generating functional for the correlators on the boundary:

q

yk=1

1

q!z

z({i}) =xq

dnxkho1(x1)...oq(xq)i1(x1)...q(xq) = hexp{z dxxi

i(x)oi(x)}i
(128)
this requires short distance singularities of the correlators to be integrable, or else the intro-
duction of some device to render the expression meaningful. in any case we might always go
back to considering individual correlators. obviously, if the operators oi on the boundary cft
have conformal dimension i then the currents i should have conformal dimension n  i.
similarly any other quantum number the operators may have (say as multiplets of su(2, 2|4)
in the case of ads5s5) would have to be supplemented by conjugate quantum numbers of the
currents so that singlets may be formed. supposing the generating functional of the currents
{i(x)} (x  (cid:16)adsn+1(cid:17)  en) makes sense, the description of this object in adsn+1 should

29

be by a path integral with elds i(y) in that theory (i.e. with y  adsn+1) tending to the
boundary currents {i(x)} in a certain prescribed way, that we shall have to infer. in the large
n limit we would just have to work out the classical action, and in the large n strong coupling
limit, just the classical supergravity action on elds satisfying the equations of motion and
tending to the prescribed boundary currents in some particular way.

4.2 free scalar elds on adsn+1

by a scalar eld we mean one which transforms as a scalar under the ads isometry group, hence
it would tend to a boundary value with conformal dimension zero, and couple to operators with
conformal dimension n. in that case it turns out to be meaningful to simply require the path
integral on adsn+1 with the scalar eld in question tending to a denite value on the boundary

(x)  0(x)

for x  adsn+1 and x  en and (somehow) x  x. let us study the case of free scalar elds.
here the path integral becomes trivial, and is simply equal to the exponential of (minus or
i times) the classical action, up to a normalization constant. thus in this case the classical
approximation is the exact result. the action on adsn+1 is

i() =

1

2zadsn+1

dn+1xg

so we seek a classical eld, satisfying the equation of motion

dd(x) =

1
g

(cid:16)g(x)(cid:17) = 0

(129)

(130)

throughout adsn+1, but such that (x)  0(x) whenever the point x in adsn+1 runs away
to  in the particular way that denes the boundary point x  en of the boundary.
it is plausible that the classical solution to this problem is unique. indeed, imagine 1(x)
and 2(x) both being solutions of the equation of motion with the same boundary value. then
(x)  1(x)2(x) has boundary value zero and also satises eq.(130). we should show that
 vanishes identically. since it vanishes at innity we take it to be square integrable. then

0 = z dn+1xgdd =z dn+1xg

since  is positive (semi) denite (in the euclidean case), we nd

or  constant. but as it tends to zero, it must vanish everywhere.

we may solve the problem in terms of a greens function, the generalized propagator,

  0

(131)

(132)

k(x, x)

30

with x  adsn+1 and x  en (or e1,n1 in the minkowski case), or since we have seen the
boundary to be compactied, sn, which we will take to denote the boundary. thus we seek a
solution to the problem

1
g

x

(cid:16)g

x k(x, x)(cid:17) = 0

(133)

and somehow k(x, x) a delta function when x is on the boundary. then we may construct the
sought for classical solution as

(x) =zsn

dnxk(x, x)0(x), x  adsn+1

(134)

following witten [3], we construct this propagator in the coordinates eq.(21), taking for de-
niteness euclidean signature:

ds2 =

1

(x0)2

n

x=0

(dx)2

(135)

now adsn+1 is described by the upper half space x0 > 0, and x  x,  = 1, ..., n are
coordinates in en, the coordinates of the boundary. however, we know that we must be
dealing with a compactied boundary sn, and there is an extra point at innity described
at some length around eq.(27). the boundary here is x0 = 0; the single point at innity is
x0 = , a single point indeed, no matter what the values of the remaining coordinates are,
since the metric tensor vanishes there.

in these coordinates then

g =

(136)

(137)

satises laplaces equation eq.(133) for x0 6= 0 and ~x 6= ~x , and becomes the desired delta
function in the limit x0  0.
we may also infer the above more elegantly from wittens trick [3], useful in the sequel. first
notice, that just as the scalar propagator in at space is poincare invariant so the propagator in
our case is invariant under the ads isometry group. then let the boundary point ~x  represent
the point, p at innity:

k(x; p ) = k(x0, ~x ; p )

(138)

this cannot depend on ~x due to translation invariance, so in that particular case, k is a
function of x0 only, and laplaces equation becomes

here

0(cid:16)g0k(x0)(cid:17) = 0

x0 ; 0 = g000 = (x0)20

0 =

31

so the equation becomes

if we try to solve with k(x0) = c(x0)p we nd

d

dx0(cid:16)(x0)n+1 d

dx0 k(x0)(cid:17) = 0

(139)

p(n + p) = 0

the solution with p = 0 cannot describe something with delta function support at innity,
x0 = , since such a delta function should vanish on the boundary x0 = 0 for any ~x . hence

next apply a transformation to map p  ~x  = ~0:

k(x0, ~x ; p ) = c(x0)n

x  z 

x

(x0)2 + ~x 2 ,  = 0, ..., n

this transformation is indeed an so(1, n + 1) isometry of adsn+1 (in this case with euclidean
signature). in fact we nd with x2  (x0)2 + ~x 2

for x0  0. also

(x0)n

is independent of x0 and convergent, as seen by scaling to the new integration variable xi/x0, so
that a limit is obtained for x0  0, and we may adjust c to get proper normalization if desired.

in the classical (super)gravity limit the generating function for operators o(~x ) in the boundary

follows that in this (trivial) example, there are only connected 2-point functions

33

(152)

this is the expected result: the so(1, n + 1)-scalar, (x) will couple to conformal operators
of dimension n on the boundary in order for the coupling

z dnxo(~x )0(~x )

to be invariant. and conformal invariance (indeed dilatation invariance) suces then to x the
form of the 2-point function to eq.(152). in the case of ads5  s5 this operator will turn out
to be the t r(f 2) of the ym eld strength (sect. 4.5).
notice that the 2-point function eq.(152) is characteristic of a quantum theory with a non
trivial short distance singularity. this is so even though it was derived from a classical calcu-
lation in the bulk of adsn+1.

4.3 massless abelian gauge eld on adsn+1

we continue to follow ref.[3]. a gauge eld a(x) in adsn+1 with  = 0, 1, ..., n gives rise to a
eld strength

satisfying the free equation of motion (no currents)

f = a  a

(gf ) = 0

1
g

(153)

now again we seek to construct, rst a propagator with one delta function source on the
boundary. with that we then build any gauge eld a(~x ) in the bulk with the property that
the components ai(x0, ~x ), i  1 tend to prescribed functions on the boundary, corresponding
a certain 1-form on the boundary
(154)

a0(~x ) = ai(~x )dxi

as before, we use the trick of rst working out the propagator when the point on the boundary
is the point p at innity. again, in that case we expect the propagator to be independent of
any ~x . further, the propagator should be a 1-form, but in that case, one with no 0-component.
the remaining components are all treated the same way. we treat the components in the
boundary one by one.

thus we look for a 1-form in the bulk of adsn+1, only depending on x0, and with a single

component only, say the ith

a(i)(x) = f (x0)dxi

it should satisfy the equation of motion, eq.(153). we have

a(i)
i = f (x0), a(i)
f0i = f (x0) = fi0, all other f  0
f 0i = (x0)4f (x0)

  0,  6= i

gf 0i = (x0)n+3f (x0)

(155)

34

then the equations of motion give

d

dx0 (gf 0i) =

(x0)n2dxi (xed i)

a(i) =

(the normalization is for later convenience). we hope this 1-form will have a delta-function
singularity at p . we exhibit this as before using the so(1, n + 1) isometry (inversion)

this new propagator represents propagation from ~x  = ~0 on the boundary to (x0, ~x ) in the
bulk. when we work out the derivatives we see that this new 1-form propagator will have
components along all the dierent dxs. we may simplify, using the fact that the propagator
is unique only up to gauge transformation. we shall in fact get a simpler expression if we
subtract the pure gauge

this is the nal result. to see that this is in accord with the conjecture, notice that a gauge-
eld 1-form in adsn+1 is a scalar under so(1, n + 1). hence, the components have conformal
dimension +1 on the boundary, so they couple to operators, ji, in the conformal eld theory
on the boundary with conformal dimension n  1, but these currents must be conserved by
virtue of gauge invariance in the bulk. according to the conjecture we have calculated the
generating function for these operators in eq.(170). we see that they have only non vanishing
2-point functions:

hji(~x )jj(~x )i

we conclude that the conjecture also works for free massless gauge elds. furthermore, we
have constructed a propagator also in that case (in a particular gauge).

the case of massless gravitons in the bulk is a little more complicated [2, 3]. they couple

to the energy momentum tensor on the boundary.

4.4 free massive elds on adsn+1

following witten again[3] we shall argue that a massive scalar with mass m in adsn+1 must
couple to operators o with conformal dimension  in the boundary theory, given by the
largest root of
(173)

(  n) = m2

of course we have already checked the case of m = 0. in the massive case it turns out that we
have to reinterpret the idea that the eld  should tend to a denite (current) eld on the
boundary.

we take the free massive theory in the bulk to be described by

i() =

indeed as wee shall see in sect. 4.5, is the casimir of so(n + 1). we want to understand the
behaviour of (y, ) for y   ( are coordinates on sn). the klein-gordon equation in
these coordinates becomes

for large y, the centrifugal term is negligible and we get approximately

eny d

(eny d

) = m2

the solution is an exponential ey provided

(n + ) = m2

(181)

thus there are 2 linearly independent solutions which asymptotically behave as

e+y and ey

with + and  the larger and the smaller solutions for  respectively. only one particular
linear combination is an allowed solution free of singularities in the interior of adsn+1, and
hence its asymptotic behaviour is dominated by

e+y

it follows that we cannot assume that (x) tends to a denite value on the boundary!
we might try to assume (with ~x a coordinate on the boundary)

near the boundary. but the form ey is rather arbitrary. in fact, the function

(y, ~x )  (ey)+0(~x )

(182)

ey  f (y, ~x )

has a 1st order zero on the boundary (taking into account the metric on adsn+1). it is there-
fore just of the form needed to build a nite metric from the divergent ads one. but this
construction has a degree of arbitrariness about it. thus, if we transform

into

f (y, ~x ) = ey

ew(~x )ey  f (y, ~x )

that new function has an equally good 1st order zero. thus, demanding an asymptotic be-
haviour

this freedom in f implies a freedom in 0:

0(~x )

(y, ~x ) (cid:16)f (y, ~x )(cid:17)+
f  ewf  0  ew+0

so, the arbitrariness, f  ewf , shows that the metric on adsn+1 in a natural way only denes
a conformal class of metrics on the boundary:
if hij is a metric on the boundary dened by
means of f , then e2whij is a conformally transformed metric obtained from ewf .

40

(183)

this is all consistent with the eld theory on the boundary being conformally invariant.
then namely, the eld theory is insensitive to the conformal rescalings of the metric. the eld
theory can only conceive of a conformal class.

but then the behaviour

is the statement that 0 is not a function, but rather a density with conformal weight +.
indeed, a density of weight d would have the property that for a small length 

hij  e2whij  0  ew+0

()d0

should be invariant under conformal scaling. that works, since the above is transformed into

(ew)dew+0

so the only natural procedure is to require that massive elds should tend to densities 0,

which is invariant for d = +.
and therefore should couple to operators o with conformal dimension n + + so that

o0

is a density with weight n.

we now verify that this state of aairs is in full accordance with the general prescription.
as before we want to solve for a propagator. we use again coordinates with metric (in units

where the radius b of adsn+1 has been put equal to 1)

ds2 =

(x0)2

(dx)2

n

x0

again we begin with a propagator vanishing on the boundary x0 = 0, but developing a delta-
function at p : x0 = , and thus being independent of ~x . denoting again the propagator as
k(x0, ~x ; ~x ) and in particular k(x0, ~x ; p ) = k(x0), the equation of motion is

(cid:16)  (x0)n+1 d

dx0 (x0)n+1 d

dx0 + m2(cid:17)k(x0) = 0

we may nd a solution of the form k(x0)  (x0)+n provided

(184)

(185)

only the solution k(x0) = (x0)n++ will vanish for x0 = 0. as before the propagator k(x0, ~x ;~0)
is found by the inversion

giving

(x0)2 + ~x 2

((x0)2 + (~x  ~x )2)n++

(186)

notice that according to the rule eq.(161), this does not tend to a delta-function when x0  0,
rather it is

(x0)n+2+

which tends to n(~x  ~x ) for x0  0. hence, when we build the classical eld as

((x0)2 + (~x  ~x )2)n++

(x0, ~x ) = cz dnx

(x0)n++

((x0)2 + (~x  ~x )2)n++
(x0)n+2+

0(~x )

= (x0)+cz dnx

((x0)2 + (~x  ~x )2)n++

0(~x )

(187)

we see that for x0  0, this behaves as

(x0)+0(~x )  e+y0(~x )

as anticipated.

as explained, 0(~x ) has conformal dimension + and couples on the boundary to operators
o with conformal dimension  = n++. therefore we would expect to nd a 2-point function

ho(~x )o(~x )i =

1

(~x  ~x )2n+2+

(188)

we now verify that this is indeed what is obtained, using the by now well established prescrip-
tion.

namely, we evaluate the classical free action on the classical eld as follows:

0(~x )

icl(0) z dnxdnx 0(~x )0(~x )

in complete agreement with the expectation eq.(188). since + is the larger root of

it is intuitively plausible how to generalize to elds other than scalars. we saw that the massless
1-form gauge-eld a = adx restricting to aidxi on the boundary, naturally had component
elds of dimension 1. likewise a massless p-form eld cp has component elds with dimension
p and couples to operators on the boundary with dimension n  p.
in the scalar case to

a massive p-form eld would couple to operators which would have dimensions shifted as

4.5 comparison of multiplet data in the bulk and on the boundary
in ref.[3] witten makes a check on the maldacena conjecture in the case of ads5  s5. similar
checks may be performed in more complicated situations. the check is restricted to the case
of the strong coupling (in the boundary theory) and large n approximation, which may be
treated by classical supergravity. even though we can neglect string excitations in that limit,
the compactication on s5 gives rise to kaluza-klein excitations with massive modes. we
may use the inverse radius of of s5 as our unit of mass (as in the preceding subsections), i.e.
continue to put that equal to 1. thus we should at rst analyze the spectrum of kk excitations
(for a general discussion, see [28]). this was done some time ago, in [29] by studying small
uctuations of the supergravity elds around the ads5s5 background, and in [30] by applying
the powerful technique of (super) group representation theory. these analyses lead to several

43

innite families of massive eld modes with denite masses and transformation properties
under so(1, 5) so(6) or even better, under su(1, 3|4) (su(2, 2|4) for minkowski signature).
the representation theory of that supergroup has been considered for example in [30, 31, 32].
according to the maldacena conjecture, these give rise to predictions concerning the spectrum
of conformal operators in the n = 4 u() boundary theory. for a given set of quantum
numbers (conjugate to the ones for the modes in the bulk theory) we may predict conformal
dimensions using the result of the previous subsection. we must ask whether in fact quantum
corrections would upset the result of such a simple analysis. however, it turns out that both in
the bulk theory and in the boundary theory, there exist large classes of small representations
with properties similar to properties of bps states and for which such quantum corrections
cannot occur. this makes it possible to perform meaningful checks. in the boundary theory
these are the so called chiral primaries (see for example [33]).

here we shall not attempt an account of this which is anywhere near complete. instead
we shall restrict ourselves to analyzing certain aspects of one family, the one corresponding to
kk-excitations of the dilaton eld. we shall show, that the masses of these excitations obey
the rule

m2 = k(k + 4), k = 0, 1, 2, ...

(196)

in the boundary conformal eld theory witten pointed out that the corresponding operators
are of the form

o(i1,...,ik)(x) = t r((i1    ik)ff )(x)

(197)
but only when the symmetrized tensor in {i1, ..., ik} is taken, do these elds belong to a multiplet
of chiral primaries. precisely then do the elds transform as an irreducible representation of
so(6) (see below). the trace is over the adjoint of the u(n) gauge group. the scalar (n  n
matrix valued) elds i(x), i = 1, ..., 6 have been mentioned before. they transform in the
{6} vector representation of so(6). the f is the u(n) eld strength matrix written as an
n  n matrix. it is trivial to count the conformal dimension in the weak coupling limit where
free eld dimensions apply. there the scalars have dimension 1, and the eld strength tensor
dimension 2, so o11,...,ik(x) has dimension k

k = k + 4

(198)

this ts with the formula of the previous subsection eq.(193) (for k = ) in the case of the
mass values eq.(196).
in general the check would not be convincing since we used a strong
coupling argument in the bulk and a weak coupling one on the boundary. but because it may
be shown that we are dealing with the above mentioned small representations, the result will
survive quantum corrections. as emphasized we shall not go into these crucial matters, but
here restrict ourselves to an elementary account of kk-modes of the dilaton eld.
exercise: consider the case of ads5 s5 and consider the kk-mode of the dilaton eld which
is independent of the coordinates on s5, the s-wave. supposing it couples indeed to t r(f 2)
as described, work out the 2-point function of that operator in the supergravity picture, using
the result of sect. 4.2. in particular work out the coecient in the value of the classical action,
left out in the calculation there, taking into account the integration over s5 and the scale b.
verify that the coecient is a numerical constant times n 2. argue that the form of the 2-point

44

function is exactly the expected one for the operator t r(cid:16)f 2(cid:17) in the large n limit (cf. [2]).
as we have seen before, the dilaton decouples in the background ads5  s5 and satises the
free 10dimensional equation of motion
1
g

(199)

(cid:16)gg(cid:17) = 0

we may use a splitting of this into the 5 components of the ads5 and the 5 components of the
s5. thus, if we expand the dilaton eld on s5 in eigen modes of the laplacian on s5, we see
that these eigenvalues will play the role of (minus) m2-values in ads5.

our rst task will be to understand the connection between the laplacian on s5 (more

generally sn+1) and the quadratic casimir of so(6) (so(n + 2)).

we may think of sn+1 as imbedded in rn+2 in close analogy to the case of adsn+1 (indeed
many of the results below carry over to results for so(2, n), but subtle important dierences
exist). thus dene sn+1 by the condition

y2
0 + y2

1 + ... + y2

n + y2

n+1 = 1

(200)

we are interested in scalar elds dened on sn+1, but we may trivially extend those to scalar
elds on rn+2. in fact, dene

n+1

2 =

(y)2

x=0

then a scalar eld,  on sn+1 is only dened for  = 1, but we may extend the denition
to rn+2 by demanding  independent of  along xed directions in rn+2. more concretely,
introduce coordinates (, x) similar to eq.(7) by

y0 = 

1  x2
1 + x2 , y = 

2x
1 + x2 ,  = 1, ..., n + 1

y2 = 2

(201)

we then extend a eld (x) into

(, x)  (1, x)  (x)

on any scalar eld (y), the generators of so(n + 2) are simply (for generalized treatments
along these lines, see for example [32])

with the standard algebra:

lmn = i(ymn  ynm)

[lmn, lpq] = i{nplmq + mqlnp  nqlmp  mplnq}

(202)

(203)

further we have the vielbeins and their relation to the metric on sn+1 (the ym  yms are the
at coordinates, the set (, x)  (x0, x) are the curvilinear ones).

(use: dn+2y(y2  1) = dn+1xdg(  1)) and the statement about the connection between

46

thus we are let to perform an analysis of the dilaton eld on sn+1 similar to the analysis
of scalars on s2 according to spherical harmonics y m
 (, ). in this latter case the laplacian is
well known to be identied with (minus) the square of the angular momentum with eigenvalues
( + 1) for integer . of course the square of the angular momentum is just the casimir of
so(3). we want to arrive at a similar understanding in general.

let us single out as special coordinate

in general a representation of so(n+2) would be characterized by a highest weight state, |~n+2i
with a certain highest weight, ~n+2 of so(n + 2), a vector in weight space, the components of
which are eigenvalues of a mutually commuting set of cartan generators of the algebra so(n+2).
let us take one of these to be

x1

h  l0,n+1

corresponding to rotations in the complex u-plane, and generating an so(2) subgroup. the
remaining cartan generators pertain to an so(n) subgroup commuting with that so(2). with
this choice our weights are then automatically labelled by (i) the eigenvalue of h and (ii) by a
highest weight of that so(n), i.e. we classify irreducible representations according to the

subgroup. and we write

so(2)  so(n)

~n+2 = (k, ~n)

there are n raising and lowering operators relative to h. indeed, dene

then work out

j +
i  li,n+1 + ili0

[h, j +

i ] = [l0,n+1, li,n+1 + ili0] = [l0,n+1, li,n+1] + i[l0,n+1, li0]

= il0i + i2ln+1,i = j +

i

thus we may write

cn+2 =

lmnlmn = x1i<jn

lijlij + l0il0i + ln+1,iln+1,i + l0,n+1l0,n+1

(212)

(213)

(214)

(215)

(216)

so acting on a highest weight state, j +

i will vanish, and we get

cn+1 = cn + k(k + n)

(217)

where k denotes the eigenvalue of the so(2) generator h.

let us rst consider the (n + 2)-dimensional vector representation of so(n + 2). the lmns

are represented by (n + 2)  (n + 2) matrices

(lmn)ab = i(manb  namb)

(218)

and h gives eigenvalue 1 for the highest weight state

(y0, y1, ..., yn, yn+1) =

1
2
(interpreted as a column). the raising operators j +
i give zero on the same state, and so
do the so(n) generators lij, i, j = 1, ..., n. it follows that the highest weight of the vector
representation is

(1, 0, ..., 0,i)

~n+2(vector) = (1,~0)

(219)

and the casimir has the value above with k = 1 and cn = 0. next consider the k-fold tensor
product of the vector representation with k a positive integer. the highest weight is trivially
(k,~0) but the representation is highly reducible. the unique irreducible representation with
the same highest weight is the symmetrized tensor product. this is the one we encountered in
eq.(197), and we see now that the casimir of the representation is given by k(k+n), k = 0, 1, 2, ...
(generalizing the result k(k + 1) for n + 2 = 3).

we now consider the generalized spherical harmonics of the scalar (dilaton) eld on sn+1.
in the case of so(3) these are the usual spherical harmonics y m
 (, ) with  integer. they
constitute a complete set of scalar functions on s2. they carry irreducible representations of
so(3) with the highest weight member

y 
 (, ) = n sin ei

(220)

the normalization is not interesting here, but is easily evaluated to

n =r2 + 1

4 p(2)!

2!

all the other spherical harmonics are obtained from this one by applying lowering operators.
in general for sn+1 and so(n+2), we may construct a similar highest weight scalar function

for any xed positive integer k

yk(y)  nkuk = nk(y0 + iyn+1)k = nk sink eik

(221)

where we used the denitions in eq.(210) and eq.(211). this is a regular well dened function
on sn+1 only for positive integer values of k. of course the similarity with the elementary case
is strong (the normalization would depend on n). it is trivial to verify with the form of the

48

generators we have given, that this eld is indeed a highest weight state of so(n + 2) with
highest weight

~n+1 = (k, ~n = ~0)

(222)

just as for the symmetrized k-fold tensor representation. therefore, constructing a represen-
tation of so(n + 2) by rotating this yk(y) in all possible ways, or, equivalently by forming all
possible linear combinations of elds obtained from it by applying lowering operators, we shall
get a nite dimensional irreducible representation of so(n + 2), in fact precisely the one we
met above by considering symmetrized tensor products.

in the present case of so(n + 2) there are of course very many more irreducible represen-
tations to worry about than for the case of so(3), and we might wonder if the generalized
scalar spherical harmonics dened by eq.(221) (together with all of its multiplet members),
would really form a complete set of functions on sn+1 for n > 2. this will be so, if we are able
to construct arbitrarily good approximations to delta functions with support at any point on
sn+1, using (linear combinations of) these functions. it is actually intuitively obvious that this
should be possible. in fact, consider what we may do with the highest weight functions yk(y)
themselves, directly. for very high values of k it follows from eq.(221) and the sphere condition

y2
0 + y2

n+1 = 1  ~y2  1

that these functions only have appreciable support in the neighbourhood of the unit circle

y2
0 + y2

n+1 = 1, ~y = ~0

(223)

along this circle the coordinate is  and

yk  eik

essentially a 1-dim. plane wave.
it follows that we may construct arbitrarily good approx-
imations to delta functions with support at any point along the circle eq.(223). since our
representation space also contains all possible rotations of the functions yk we may form delta
functions with support at any point we please on sn+1, and thus indeed we have found the
complete set of generalized spherical harmonics.

the casimir for this representation is therefore k(k + n) or k(k + 4) in the case of s5. but
these are just the squared mass values we needed for the kk-excitations, eq.(196), in order for
the maldacena conjecture to be checked in this particular instance.

5 breaking susy and conformal invariance in the bound-
ary theory. a possible new approach to (large n ) qcd

the maldacena conjecture suggests a mathematical equivalence between string/m theory in
certain backgrounds, and a conformally invariant ordinary quantum eld theory on the bound-
ary. field theories, such as the standard model are not conformally invariant: they typically
posses a mass gap, there is a lightest massive meson for example. although the maldacena
conjecture would seem to throw extremely interesting light on non-perturbative aspects of
quantum eld theory, it would therefore also seem that we are restricted to theories rather far
removed from reality. however, witten [10] proposed a scheme whereby it seems possible to
overcome these diculties. perhaps the most interesting case is that of ads7 s4. the bound-
ary theory here is a certain so called (2,0) exotic 6-dimensional conformally invariant theory for
which no action seems available [34] (see also lectures by e. bergshoe and by p.c. west, this
school). by compactifying everything on a 2-torus, t 2, however, the boundary theory becomes
4-dimensional, and provided the fermions in the theory are taken anti-periodic around a cycle
on the t 2, supersymmetry and conformal invariance are broken at low energies, and the set up
provides a novel way of treating (regularized) large n ordinary qcd in 4 dimensions (albeit
without quarks)! for a long time it has been a dream for theoretical particle physics [35] to
be able to do something non trivial with that theory. glueballs would be stable in that limit
so that perhaps the theory could be suciently tractable to furnish an analytic understanding
of connement. despite intense interest in this large n limit, however, very little has been
achieved in the way of concrete results. the maldacena conjecture combined with wittens
proposal seems to introduce a truly novel approach.

here, at rst we shall be more general, following the discussion of [10], and in the end
we shall mostly restrict to the somewhat simpler case of ads5  s5 for which we introduce a
single t 1 = s1 compactication, thereby rendering a framework for studying large n qcd in
3 space-time dimensions. at the end we shall indicate some of the rst steps that have to be
taken in order to treat also qcd4.

to see how a suitable spin structure can break supersymmetry and conformal invariance at
low energies, we go to euclidean time and take it periodic on a circle of radius r, corresponding
to an inverse temperature of 2r. a bosonic degree of freedom has to be periodic along this
time t:

there are of course then (kk-like) excitations with masses n/r. for fermions, we have the
option of considering a non trivial spin structure. clearly, if we also take the fermions periodic,
they will be quantized with the same integer modes as the bosons, and supersymmetry will be
preserved. but if we take fermions to be anti-periodic around euclidean time, they have modes

(n +

1
2

)/r

in particular, the lowest mode n = 0 is very dierent for bosons and for fermions. for bosons
we have a massless mode, but for fermions the lowest mode can be considered to decouple for
high enough temperatures. so supersymmetry is broken. if we investigate the theory with very

50

q(t) =xnz(cid:16)aneint/r(cid:17)

(224)

high frequencies, much higher than the temperature, these details are irrelevant and we expect
to regain a supersymmetric situation.

the scalar supersymmetric partners of fermions will get masses due to renormalization. in
the supersymmetric theory the masses are protected from being divergent. thus in the eective
low energy theory, we shall have divergencies cut o by the cut o of the eective theory,
which is the temperature. thus we also expect scalar super partners of fermions to become
massive and therefore to decouple at low energies. finally, the eective theory will have a
non-vanishing beta function, because some of the eld modes which make the beta function
vanish in the full theory are absent in the low energy eective theory. thus, the eective low
energy theory is no longer conformal.

it follows, that apparently we have a scheme for dealing with a realistic (qcd like) theory. in
that theory, the coupling constant should run at high energies to a small value, since the theory is
asymptotically free. the smallest value is the one attained at the cut o, the temperature, and it
would be given by the xed coupling constant of the unbroken theory. therefore, in order to use
this scheme in a fully realistic way, we should arrange for the coupling constant of the boundary
theory to be small. we have previously seen, that the very simple supergravity approximation
is obtained when the coupling constant of the boundary theory is large. therefore, a straight
forward study of large n qcd in 3 or 4 dimensions based on supergravity, cannot be hoped
to be realistic.
it is perhaps similar to a strong coupling analysis of lattice gauge theory,
known to be in a wrong phase. what we would rather like to do, would be to study not
supergravity, but the full string theory in the appropriate background. at large n it should
even be enough to study classical string theory - or the tree diagram limit only, in order to
have a realistic framework for large n qcd. this goal has not yet been achieved, although
preliminary proposals have been given [26, 27, 25].

instead, a large number of studies have been performed in the supergravity approximation.
such studies can at best be considered to have an exploratory nature, but it is very instructive
to see how several expectations from connement are brought out in a very simple way (see
refs. [36, 10, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 5], to name but a few).

5.1 classical, nite temperature versions of ads

according to the previous discussion, we are led to consider nite temperature versions of
anti de sitter spaces. as shown by hawking and page [44] and generalized by witten [10]
there are two relevant manifolds denoted x1 and x2 which we must consider.

5.1.1 the manifold x1

the rst one is the simplest. in the standard case of poincare isometry, we may arrange for a
nite temperature by taking euclidean signature, and by compactifying the time on s1. that
compactication may be thought of as a periodic identication of euclidean time. all bosonic
elds would have to be periodic under: t  t + 2r. this mapping is a translation in time,
 : t 7  (t), and the set of all translations,  n, form a group isomorphic to z. thus in the case

51

of ads+

n+1 we may try to do something similar. consider the embedding condition:

uv 

n

xi=1

x2
i = b2

(225)

with ads+
to r and to be related to the temperature), and dene the mapping

n+1 being the branch u, v > 0. now introduce a real, positive parameter  (analogous

u  1u, v  v, xi  xi

(226)

this is a mapping, f of adsn+1 onto itself. the set of all repeated applications of this
mapping (an the inverses) {f n
|n  z} constitute a group isomorphic to z. generalizing the
case of poincare isometry we may consider the manifold

x1  ads+

n+1/z

so x1 is the set of equivalence classes where two points p, p  in adsn+1 are equivalent if
they are related by one of these mappings. we see that a fundamental domain for v is

namely v/b = 1 and v/b =  is the same point in x1. these points parametrize indeed a circle

1  v/b  

(227)

v/b = /2

 =

2 ln v/b

ln 

(228)

( = 0  v/b = 1,  = 2  v/b =   1). for any v in the fundamental domain, we may
solve for

u =(cid:16)b2 +

n

xn=1

x2

i(cid:17)/v

x1  rn  s1

uv 

n

xi=1

x2
i = 0

and use for x1 the coordinates (x1, ..., xn) together with the angular coordinate . it follows
that topologically

as for the boundary of x1, we know it is obtained by scaling u, v, xi by s  , equivalent to
the condition

subject to projective equivalence. thus we may x a scale so that

dening sn1. we see that the boundary of x1 has topology

xi=1 (cid:16)xi/b(cid:17)2

= 1

(229)

x1  sn1  s1

52

these spheres have two dierent radii, but only the ratio is relevant for the conformal struc-
ture. we shall come back to that.

let us introduce a convenient metric on x1. write

n1, or

dr2

1 + (r/b)2 + (r/b)2d2

n1

(we performed as usual the mostly minus to mostly plus operation). this is our nal metric
on x1.

5.1.2 the manifold x2

this is the case where a temperature is introduced by in fact inserting a black hole into adsn+1,
the schwarzschild metric generalized to adsn+1. thus we seek a static, spherically symmetric
metric of the general form

ds2 = a(r)dt2 + b(r)dr2 + r2d2

n1

(234)

with r = 0 being the position of the black hole. outside the black hole we have einsteins
empty space equation (with a cosmological constant)

r = 

n
b2 g, d = n + 1

53

(235)

thus the black hole solution x2 will also be an example of an einstein space, but one less
symmetric than adsn+1, even though the two are asymptotically similar.

we nd the following non zero christoel symbols (ij denotes the metric on sn1):

redening the scale of t and the meaning of c1, c2, we may put f = 1. also, to get the empty
solution for x1 as a special case, we put the new c2 = 1. thus we nally have the schwarzschild
solution in adsn+1 for x2:

this will turn out to mean that m becomes the mass of the black hole.

notice, that this of course generalizes the metric of the standard b = , 4-dimensional

black hole (euclidean, n = 3, rg = 2gn m = w3m):

ds2 =(cid:16)1

5.1.3 temperature of the black hole

we expect that a black hole will have a (beckenstein-hawking) temperature, and that of course
was our motivation for picking this metric. let us work out what the temperature is. the metric
eq.(245) is of the form

where

ds2 = v (r)dt2 +

dr2
v (r)

+ r2d2

n1

v (r) =

r2
b2 + 1 

wnm
rn2

(247)

(248)

and vanishes at various values of r, the largest of which we shall denote, r+. this is characteristic
of a metric with a horizon: g00 vanishes and grr has a pole at the horizon, r = r+. ordinary
physical space is the region r  r+. in our case of a diagonal metric, grr = 1/grr. it is rather

55

easy to establish the general formula [41] for the temperature, t of the black hole in the case
of such a diagonal metric:

2t = grr d
dr

g00|r=r+

(other equivalent formulas are easily obtained). to see this, notice that the horizon property
implies that near r = r+

and the metric takes the following form in the vicinity of the horizon

g00  a(r  r+), grr  b(r  r+)

ds2 

dr2

b(r  r+)

+ dt2a(r  r+) + r2d2

n1

(249)

(250)

(251)

(254)

this metric has a coordinate singularity at the horizon, which we may remove by a suitable
choice of coordinates, but only if the euclidean time is periodic with a particular period, which
one then identies with the inverse temperature. in fact [44] the coordinate singularity may be
made analogous to a standard 2-dimensional polar coordinate singularity

ds2 = d2 + 2d2

(252)

where  is the polar distance and  is the polar angle. at  = 0 the metric is singular, but
we know very well that the geometry is regular provided the polar angle has period 2. if the
periodicity is anything else than 2 there is a genuine geometrical conical singularity.

we may arrange for the metric eq.(251) to look similar to eq.(252) if we put

d2 =

dr2

b(r  r+)

,

d
dr

=

1

,  =

2
b

r  r+

(253)

where we have chosen  to vanish at the horizon. then the rst two terms of eq.(251) become

pb(r  r+)
ds2  d2 + 2 ab

dt2

we see that this metric describes a regular geometry provided the euclidean time t is periodic
with period

 =

from this eq.(249) is easily obtained. we also see that only r  r+ is relevant.

in our case, we have near r = r+

n b).

notice that 0(r+) vanishes at r+ = 0 and for r+  . also it attains a maximum (of
4b/pn(n  2), at r+ = q n2
it follows, that unlike the manifold x1, which may be
constructed for any temperature, the black hole metric, x2 only exists for small values of 
or large values of the temperature. it will turn out in fact, that x1 dominates the dynamics
at low temperatures, and x2 at high temperatures. we see that to get a high temperature
requires either r+  0 or r+  . we shall see below, that the thermodynamics is dominated
by r+  . in that case the v = 0 equation for r+ implies that also m  , indeed that

remarkably, this form of the x2 metric makes it completely equivalent to the non-extremal
brane solutions eq.(117), eq.(118), eq.(119). the relation between the two forms is in all cases
d~x 2 after a suitable scaling (see below). the relations between the
u = r and d2

although the solutions are expressed in terms of two parameters, one may in fact bee scaled
away (see below). notice that the p-brane solutions and the black hole solution have totally
dierent symmetries and asymptotic behaviours. only in the limits considered here (near
horizon and large mass) do they agree.

the topology of the solution is

x2  s2  sn1

since the (t, r) space is topologically similar to the 2-dimensional plane (described by polar
coordinates), which compacties to s2. on this space there are no non-contracitible loops, in
contrast to the case of x1.

the topology becomes s1  sn1 on the boundary. however, we would like to consider
limits where the boundary looks more like s1 rn1, corresponding to the radius of sn1 being
much larger than the radius of the s1.

5.1.4 thermodynamics of the black hole/non-extremal brane solution

in the classical supergravity limit, the cft partition function should be evaluated as

ei = ei(x1) + ei(x2) = ei(x1)(cid:16)1 + ei(cid:17)
= ei(x2)(cid:16)ei + 1(cid:17)
i  i(x2)  i(x1)

we see then that for small r+, i > 0 and tends to zero when r+ tends to zero. for large r+
on the other hand i < 0. thus we have the following situation

small r+ : ei  2ei(x1)
large r+ : ei  ei(x2)
for low temperatures, x2 cannot come into play at all and

eicf t  ei(x1)

(267)

for high temperatures, however, we have both manifolds, and either r+  0 or r+  . in the
rst case, i(x2)  i(x1). in the latter case (the relevant one as it turns out), i(x2) < i(x1):

i(x2) = i(x1) + i = i(x1) +

all of that is a consequence of the formula for i eq.(266). we now justify that formula.

ei(x1) + ei(x2)|r+0  ei(x1) + ei(x2)|r+

the relevant part of the action is

this is clearly badly divergent. in fact the equations of motion give

i.e. a volume divergence. we may hope however, to make sense of the dierence, i, between i
evaluated for the two manifolds x1 and x2. this requires that we arrange for the two manifolds
somehow to be asymptotically identical in their geometrical respect. now we have for both

ds2 = v dt2 + v 1dr2 + r2d2  g = rn1

 being the determinant of the metric on the sphere sn1. v is given by eq.(248) for the
geometry of x2 and by v = 1 + (r/b)2 for the geometry of x1, eq.(233) to regulate the
integrals, we terminate the integral over r at some large r:

volume(x1)  v (x1) = z (x1)

5.2 on hadrons and connement in qcd at large n . the case of

qcd3

we have emphasized that the supergravity approximation is not satisfactory for a serious study
of large n qcd, even supposing the maldacena conjecture works, and that no unpleasant
phenomena corrupt the set up proposed by witten. nevertheless it is very instructive to see how
this approximation very naturally gives a picture in qualitative agreement with expectations
in hadronic physics. thus the area law for wilson loops, associated with connement, comes
out and goes away appropriately at high (physical) temperatures. several other aspects have
been treated [36, 40, 43]. here, however, we shall concentrate on just one of these aspects,
generation of a mass gap [3, 10, 39, 37, 45, 38, 42, 46, 47].

when we use the scheme described above in the case of ads5 s5, compactifying euclidean
time, we expect (as argued) in the boundary theory to obtain an eective (euclidean) version of
qcd3 at energies much below the temperature cut-o. in the next subsection we shall briey
indicate the framework for also dealing with qcd4. in both cases, the hadrons we expect to
nd will be stable glueballs, in particular with a minimal positive mass greater than zero: a
mass gap. this then is a non-trivial connement eect, not visible in classical ym-theory, nor
in perturbation theory.

how would we identify such a mass gap? we would need in the boundary theory to consider
a gauge invariant operator which could create a glueball, the simplest example perhaps being

o(~x ) = trf 2(~x ) 

n

xi,j=1(cid:16)f(cid:17)ij(cid:16)f (cid:17)ji

(~x ) ~x  r3

(279)

matrix. we should then work out a 2-point function

ij being the u(n) yang mills eld strength expressed as an n  n

with (f)ij = pn 2

a=1 f a

t a

ho(~x )o(~0)i  exp{|~x |m},

|~x |  

(280)

and look for the indicated exponential decay at large distances, dominated by the minimal mass,
m > 0, the mass gap. non leading exponential terms would correspond to gluon excitations.
to perform the calculation in the bulk theory, we would have to identify the eld, (y), y 
bulk, to which this operator couples. but we have already indicated in sect. 4.5.1 that the
expected candidate is the dilaton eld with no kk-excitations on s5, the s5 s-wave, or k = 0
mode [10]. we might then perform a classical supergravity calculation of the action in the ads5
background with the black hole and with prescribed boundary conditions on the dilaton eld.
however, [3, 10] it seems technically simpler to adopt a slightly dierent point of view. to
see how, begin noticing that (according to the maldacena conjecture) the two quantum theories,
the bulk theory and the boundary theory, are entirely equivalent. they have the same hilbert

61

space, the same operators and correlators, only the physical interpretation of operators dier
drastically in the two theories. first consider the boundary theory. at n  , glueballs are
free particles. when moving according to plane waves

their mass is given by

ei~k~x

m2 = ~k2,

(281)

(so only imaginary momenta correspond to being on the mass shell, as is usual in euclidean
space-time). in the hilbert space there is an operator describing translations in the boundary
theory, and ~k is the eigenvalue of that.

in the bulk theory, the very same operators occur, just with dierent interpretation. we
need to think of the hilbert space of the dilaton theory. first recall the situation for a free
scalar in at space-time. it satises the kg equation

(2  m2) = 0

to build the hilbert space (in this case the fock space) one nds modes, solutions of the
kg equation, such as eipx, and build eld operators as sums over modes, each mode being
multiplied by a creation or annihilation operator. states in the hilbert space are spanned by
multi-particle states created by the creation operators. actually, although we often consider
plane waves, we really need to put them in a quantization volume, or better in fact, consider
wave packets, square integrable modes for which

zspace

(mode)2 < 

we wish to imitate this procedure in the present case of a modied ads5 background with a
black hole in it, the manifold x2. thus we must

1. formulate the equation of motion on x2,

2. nd the square integrable modes,

3. interpret those in terms of possible m2(glueball) values.

we follow here the treatments in [10, 37, 45, 39]. in the case of ads5  s5 we have

( )  2r( ) = 1/b2 = /b

(284)

(285)

while the horizon is still at  = b.

now, the dilaton is massless in 10 dimensions, and the k = 0 mode on s5 which we should
consider, is still massless in 5 dimensions. this mode does not depend on coordinates of s5
and it satises the equation of motion on x2

 [gg] = 0

(286)

we now wish to look for modes that are (i) square integrable on x2, and (ii) correspond to a
denite momentum in the boundary theory. thus we consider the ansatz

(, ~x ) = f ()ei~k~x

(287)

also our euclidean time  is compactied corresponding to a high temperature, and we do
not want the mode to depend on  in the low energy approximation. clearly we may then
identify ~k2 = m2 as the glueball mass in the boundary theory. now we have

and of course we may scale b away and replace it by 1. this ordinary dierential equation is
the equation of motion. it has solutions for any values of ~k2, but now we must understand
the additional information coming from boundary conditions and square integrability. these
will imply that for generic ~k2 there is no acceptable solution, only for a particular spectrum of
strictly positive ~k2 values do such solutions exist.

function f () above is then a function of the polar distance only, not of the angle  . the

p  ~k2/4 = m2/4, and y  f . this homogeneous, linear, 2. order, ordinary dierential
equation has a 2-dimensional space of solutions for any value of the mass parameter, p. we
follow now the treatment of [45]. these solutions may be expressed as linear combinations
of any 2 linearly independent solutions. generically these would be analytic functions of x
with singularities at x = 0, 1,. therefore these solutions cannot be represented by series
expansions, convergent throughout the physical region 1  x < . instead, however, we may
consider expansions convergent either in

i()  {x  c|1 < |x| < }

or in

i(1)  {x  c||x  1| < 1}
respectively. thus for the case of i() we use the ansatze

inserting these expansions into the dierential equation, one nds recursion relations for the
unknown coecients with simple unique solutions.

1 (x) and y

2 (x), or a linear combination of y1

any solution of the dierential equation may then be represented, either as a linear combi-
nation of y
2(x). the series expansions
only converge in i() or i(1) respectively, but the solutions may be uniquely analytically con-
tinued to the entire complex plane (with the exception of the singularities at x = 0, 1). in the
overlap (containing 1 < x < 2), they may furthermore be directly compared. it is now clear
that y
1(x), but not
y1
2(x) satises the boundary condition at x = 1.

2 (x) satises the square integrability condition. also, only y1

1 (x) but not y

1(x) and y1

we may therefore assert, that an acceptable solution is expressed in the y

i basis simply as

1 (x)

c  y
65

and such a solution may be built for any p. however, when analytically continued to i(1), it
will generically be a expressed as a linear combination

1y1

1(x) + 2y1

2(x)

with 2 6= 0, and therefore be unacceptable from the point of view of the behaviour near x = 1.
similarly, we may assert, that any acceptable solution is expressed in the y1

i basis simply as

and of course also such a solution may be built for any p, but when analytically continued to
i() it will generically be expressed as a linear combination

c  y1

with 2 6= 0, and therefore be unacceptable from the point of view of square integrability.
condition

it follows, that if we restrict ourselves to the overlap 1 < x < 2, we are able to require the

1 (x)  y1
y

1(x)

(297)

and this condition is only satised for certain discrete values of p. these represent the sought
for spectrum of mass values. more concretely, we may pick a value such as x = x0 = 3/2 
i(1)  i(), and require the existence of a common constant, c such that

1 (x0) = cy1
y
1 )(x0) = c(y1

1(x0)
1)(x0)

(y

(298)

this will ensure that eq.(297) is satised throughout, since we are dealing with a 2-dimensional
set of solutions. these conditions are of course just equivalent to the wronski condition

i (x0) and (ya

here we should think of ya
i )(x0) (a = , 1) as functions of p (for xed x0). indeed
the coecients aa
n are determined uniquely as polynomials in p of order n. truncating the series
expansions at some high cut-o, eq.(299) becomes the condition for zeros of a certain high order
polynomial in p. as the summation cut-o is taken higher and higher, the numerically smaller
zeros of the polynomial rather quickly converge, whereas the larger zeros take more terms to
stabilize.

concretely and by way of illustration, it is easy from the dierential equation to establish

the following recursion relations (using the notation an<0  0, a

the glueball masses thus determined may be shown to pertain to j p c = 0++ states. numeri-
cally one nds (in units of 1/b) the following strictly positive mass values

11.6, 34.5, 69.0, 114.9, ..

(close, but not equal to the values, 6n(n + 1) [37, 45]). similar studies have been made for other
j p c quantum numbers. comparisons with results from lattice calculations indicate reasonable
agreement for the mass ratios.

5.3 on qcd in 4 dimensions
witten [10] has also explained how to obtain 4-dimensional qcd based on the ads7  s4
compactication of 11-dimensional m-theory with an ads7 scale eq.(113)

b = 211(n)1/3

in that case the boundary theory is the conformally invariant 6-dimensional so called (2,0)
theory[34]. excitations of this 5-brane cannot be understood in terms of open strings ending
on it, but in fact in terms of 2-branes ending on it. upon compactication on a circle of radius
r1, we obtain type iia string theory, and for small r1, iia string theory in the perturbative
regime. there the 2-branes of m-theory turn into strings and we can use string theory to
describe excitations of that once compactied theory. now the eective boundary theory is
5-dimensional. we still have to compactify once more, on a circle of radius r2 before we obtain
the desired 4-dimensional theory.
in this second step we must take fermions anti periodic
around the second s1 in order to break supersymmetry and conformal invariance. it is seen
that we assumed it made sense to perform the compactication in two steps, corresponding to
r1  r2.
in the rst step, we take susy preserving boundary conditions for the fermions, and we get
a string theory 4-brane with an eective 5-dimensional sym theory with ym coupling eq.(120)

5 = 82sgs = 82r(10)
g2

1

(301)

where the last step is the standard identication between m-theory and iia string theory upon
compactication on a circle of 10-dimensional radius r(10)
[48]. in the second compactication
on s1(r2), we may write

g2

5 z d4x

so we get for the 4-dimensional ym coupling

g2
y m

=

r2

67

(302)

at low energies this eective d3 brane theory is large n qcd with a running coupling constant,
which at large energies becomes smaller and smaller (asymptotic freedom), until the theory
changes over into a 5-dimensional one at the cut-o r2 (in string units). thus the ym
coupling eq.(302) is the value of s at that cut-o, and ideally we want that to be small in
accord with the requirement r1  r2. if the second compactication also preserves susy, we
get the n = 4 superconformal theory, but if we take fermions anti periodic around s1(r2) we
expect to obtain ordinary large n qcd (with no quarks).

in 11-dimensional units. the general rule to go between 11-dimensional and 10-dimensional
units is [48]

so this time we see that we have a non-trivial dilaton eld depending on the coordinate . this
fact, actually makes the analysis considerably more complicated. we must set up uctuation
equations for dilatons around the background provided by the above solution [37]. but a
number of subtleties exist [38, 41, 42] which we do not want to discuss here.

it is instructive to derive an equivalent version of the above, starting from the non-extremal

near horizon limit of the 11-dimensional 5-brane solution eq.(118) in 11 dimensional units

ds2 =

u 2

4l2 (cid:26)(cid:16)1 (cid:16) u0

with l2 = 2

11(n)2/3. now put

and recast this into

ds2

l2 = r(cid:26)(cid:16)1 (cid:16)r0

r (cid:17)3(cid:17)dt2 + d~x 2(cid:27) +

from the discussion above we have seen that when compactifying on a circle to get to the
10-dimensional iia metric, we must in fact write

ds2

1 (cid:17)2
(11) =(cid:16)r(11)

thus we nd (in suitable units)

d2 + g2/3

r = e4/3  e = r3/4

this is the form given in [38, 41]. the transformation

makes this form in agreement with eq.(308). it is instructive to see that it also agrees with the
non-extremal d4-brane solution. from eq.(87) we nd with

d = 10, p = 4, d = 5, a =

h = 1 +(cid:16)h

(cid:16)h

the dilaton agrees with above, but the metric being in the einstein frame does not yet. how-
ever, we may put it in the appropriate string frame using eq.(49), by multiplying the einstein
frame metric by

1

e

2  = r3/8

this precisely reproduces eq.(313).

in the supergravity approximation we should now set up uctuation equations of motion
for dilatons and other elds in the backgrounds given. however, [38] it becomes important to
diagonalize these uctuations appropriately in a non trivial way, since the dilaton background
itself is non trivial. we shall not, however, pursue these ner points.
