abstract

we reanalyse the computation of the cosmological constant  at
two loops in recently proposed superstring models without massless
gravitini, both in the theta-function based formalism and by a de-
tailed computation in the more explicit hyperelliptic description of
the underlying genus two riemann surface.  is expressed as the in-
tegral over the surface moduli of an amplitude which is zero if susy is
not completely broken, but we nd it to be nonvanishing in the susy
breaking models which can be given an explicitly workable fermionic
formulation. thus unfortunately the issue of getting realistic and per-
turbatively viable models from superstring theory remains open.

1 introduction and summary

the vanishing of the cosmological constant  is a crucial issue in super-
string theory.
in fact, if  is nonzero the theory is perturbatively unsta-
ble. unavoidable (infrared) divergences appear due to the dilaton tadpole
(proportional to ), physically signaling the fact that the at background,
over which the perturbative expansion is performed, is no longer consistent.
therefore also the perturbative spectrum and thus the particle content of
the theory is no longer trusty, and its physical meaning becomes (at least so
far) inaccessible.

the standard versions of superstring theory have indeed zero cosmolog-
ical constant [1, 2]. this can be formally argued as a consequence of exact
supersymmetry, and it has been explicitly proven at one and two loops [3],
both for the maximally supersymmetric models and also for less (but still at
least n = 1) supersymmetry [4]. it is therefore very important to investigate
whether it is possible to construct more realistic string theories, where there
are no massless gravitini and supersymmetry is completely broken. models
of that kind have recently appeared in the literature [5, 6], and including
arguments to show that  is still zero [7]. some of those models can be given
an explicitly workable fermionic formulation [6], by using which it is possible
to make a detailed analysis also at two loops. note that the one and two loop
computations are physically very dierent. in fact at one loop one evaluates
the partition function of a free theory, whereas only at two loops one begins
to see the eect of the interaction.

here we reanalyse those models. our rather explicit computation will
make use of the very convenient hyperelliptic formalism which provides a
complete description of the genus two riemann surface. thus it looks dier-
ent from the formalism used in the argument appeared in the recent literature
about the two loops vanishing of the  in the nonsusy models. however we
have also reanalysed those arguments [6, 7] and found some aws. one of
the main ingredients of the two loop computation in any formalism is the
occurrence in the amplitude of a correlator of supercurrents, related to the
fact that at genus two there are superghost zero modes also for the even
spin structures. now, in some arguments this correlator is ignored [6] (note
that the correlator is sigular at coincident points); if one does so the result is
indeed zero (as we check in our explicit computation, see eq. (68)). however
the amplitude is not the right one.

2

in more rened arguments this correlator is included. let us see it more
precisely (see for instance [8]). the amplitude a, to be integrated over the
moduli of the surface, is obtained by evaluating the expectation value of the
following quantity (times determinants of some dierential operators):

((z1))x(z1)((z2))x(z2).

(1)

this is eq. (2.10) of [8], taking the supercurrent insertion in a point: a =
(za), and considering the matter part jm = x of the supercurrent.
in the full expression one has to complete the supercurrent by adding the
ghost part and the compactied matter part to the matter part, but for
the purpose of the short discussion here it is enough to look at the partial
expression above.

the result is (up to theta-function factors):

a = (theta-functions)

kiji(z1)j(z2) + qz1z2 log e(z1, z2)

e(z1, z2)2(z1)2(z2)2

,

(2)

where kij and q are constants. this is obtained by using the bosonization
eqs. (3.15) and (3.30) of [8]:

h((z1))((z2))i = (theta-functions)/e(z1, z2)(z1)2(z2)2,

(3)

and by computing

hjm(z1)jm(z2)i = (theta-functions)

(kiji(z1)i(z2) + qz1z2 log e(z1, z2))

e(z1, z2)

.

(4)
note that the amplitude a has to be a 0-dierential in z1,2, in order to
be independent (up to irrelevant total derivatives in the moduli) on those
arbitrary points. remembering that  is a dierential of degree equal to half
the genus thus 2 is a 2 dierential in our case (genus 2), that e is a 1/2
dierential and that  like  log e is a 1-dierential, we see that the result
is in fact a 0-dierential in z1,2, indeed the same 0-degree as ()x.

now, in eq. (5.1) of ref. [7] (the key point of that argument) the formula
for a, eq. (2), appears with a crucial modication: that is, there is the extra
factor det(3/2
a are the superghost zero mode functions which
are 3/2-dierentials. (instead, the factor 1/(z1)2(z2)2 has not been written
there, but since it is spin structure independent and nonzero for z1  z2 it

a (zb)), where 3/2

3

is not relevant for the ensuing argument). but actually there is not such a
factor det(3/2
a (zb)). indeed, as a check, since it is a half-integer dierential,
it does not match with the previously recalled property of a to be a 0-
dierential. if we remove this factor to get the right amplitude, we see that
the argument of ref. [7] does no longer show the vanishing of , apart from
possibly the simpler model of ref. [7] for which however the explicit form
of the partition function and the explicit results for the spectrum have not
been given, and the fundamental integration region over the moduli appears
to be nonstandard.

this is conrmed by our explicit two loop computation for those models
which can be given an explicitly workable free fermion formulation. first, in
sect. 2, we review the fermionic construction and the model (whose gravitini
content is explicitly analysed in appendix a) and in sect. 3, in some details,
the one loop computation showing that  is zero at this order. the one loop
computation indicates a convenient strategy for the two loop one. accord-
ingly, in sect.4, the two loop amplitude is conveniently organized as a sum of
various terms, which in appendix b are classied as modular invariant sets.
many of those terms, sect.4.1, are the same as for supersymmetric models
and they were shown to vanish explicitly in ref. [4] (see also [9]), (we review
this computation in the appendix c following the strategy of one loop com-
putation). besides them there remain two sets of terms, which only occur
in nonsusy models. those of the rst set, sect.4.2, are shown to vanish by
essentially the same kind of computation as at one loop (that is, showing that
they contain at least one odd theta function). we nally, sect.4.3, focus on
the remaining set: here we nd a nonvanishing result (the crucial expression
is eq. (68), where we see that contrary to the susy case there is a crucial
change of sign which prevent the cancellation). we complete the discussion
by making the complete sum over the spin structures, to get a modular in-
variant result which contributes to the integrand of two-loop cosmological
cosntant, eq. (77).

thus unfortunately we nd that at two loops the same computation show-
ing that the cosmological constant is zero when supersymmetry is unbroken
gives a result dierent from zero in absence of supersymmetry, at least for
those models which we have been able to work out explicitely. to be pre-
cise, this computation is done for the amplitude before the integration over
the moduli of the genus two riemann surface. however all the proofs ap-
peared so far have been done in this way (including those under question

4

for the nonsusy string theories), and indeed there is no indication that the
nal integration over the moduli should vanish. thus our conclusion is that
the issue of getting realistic and viable models from superstring is still an
unsolved, possibly the main unsolved problem in this context.

2 a review of the free fermionic construction

of type ii superstring theories

in this section we review the free fermionic construction of lower dimen-
sional superstring models [10, 11]. the presentation is tailored to the type
ii superstring theory.

for type ii superstring theory in d dimensions, we have the following list

of two-dimensional elds appearing in the construction of the models:

x , ,  ( = 0, 1,    , d  1) which have a space-time interpretaion;
i, yi, i, i = 1,    , 10  d which are 3(10  d) free left (holomorphic)

majorana fermions;

i, yi, i, i = 1,    , 10  d which are 3(10  d) free right (anti-holomor-

phic) majorana fermions.
the left supercurrent is realized nonlinearly by these elds as [12]

j =   x + 2 c    b + 3 c  +

 jm + jgh + j,

i yi i,

10d

xi=1

(5)

and similarly for the right supercurrent j. as it is well-known, fermionic
elds have non-trivial boundary conditions. for dierent boundary condi-
tions these fermionic elds give dierent contributions to the partition func-
tion. the partition function should be modular invariant, guarantee the
cancellation of gauge and gravitational anomalies (in the low energy or eld
theory limit of string theory). how modular invariance restricts the possible
choice of boundary conditions was discussed in [10, 11]. by studying the
one-loop partition function and its multi-loop counterparts, they found a set
of rules of constructing modular invariant string theories. by using their
rules on can construct a lot of consistent models. lets briey review their
construction, setting d = 4 in what follows.

5

to start with let us rst recall some notations. for the torus it can be
represented by a at parallelogram in the complex plane with side 1 and
 corresponding to its two non-contractible loops. we denote the one-loop

spin structure as h 

 i where  and  are subsets of f ( the set of all

the fermions) containing those fermions that are periodic around 1 and 
respectively. for any set  of fermions (  f ) we dene its characteric
function as

(f ) = 1,

if

f  ;

(f ) = 0,

otherwise.

(6)

we also dene addition and multiplication of fermion sets as ordinary ad-
dition and multiplication modulo 2 of their characteristic functions. thus
addition is the symmetric dierence and multiplication the intersection:

 +  =       ,
 =   .

(7)
(8)

the one-loop vacuum amplitude can be written as

d2

d

2 +1||24 x,

(im )

(9)

zoneloop = z

1/2h (f )

(f ) i( ).

ch 
here ( ) is the didekin eta function; h 
with characteristic h /2

 i yf f 
 i is the jacobi theta function
/2 i. by slight abuse of notation we suppress the fact

that this theta function should be complex conjugated when f is a right
(anti-holomorphic) fermion. for later convenience, we also dene f  as the
set of all transverse fermions, i.e. f minus two s and two s. ( for
later convenience, we also use fl and fr to denote all the left fermions and
right fermions respectively. f 
l to denote all the left fermions minus two s
and similarly for f 

r).

it is important to note that in the 1-loop case there are no superghost
zero modes (in the even spin structures; the odd spin structure gives trivially
a vanishing contribution to the cosmological constant). thus, in the expres-
sion for zoneloop there is no factor containing the supercurrent (or picture
changing operators) correlator. instead, in the two loops case, since there are

6

superghost zero modes also for the even spin structures, a supercurrent cor-
relator will appear inside the sum over the spin structures dening ztwoloops.
this correlator will play a crucial role in the issue whether the cosmological
constant is also zero at two loops.

should be determined from modular invariance.

finally the coecients ch 
 i takes values equal to either +1 or 1 which
by modular invariance, the following conditions on the coecients ch 
 i

are derived [10, 11]:



ch 
 i =  ch
 +  + f i,
ch 
 ch 
 i = 2

ch 1    g

where (, ) = ()+( ),  = exp( in()
), etc. and n() is the dierence
between the number of left fermions in the set  (not counting the two
longitudinal fermions if s and/or s are in , see below) and the number
of right fermions in . these equations are all the equations required for
modular invariance to all loops.

 +  i,

(12)

(13)

the analysis of these equations is rather lengthly [10], but the results can
be presented with reasonable dispatch. the sets of fermions which enter the
summation in eq. (9) form an additive group  of subsets of f , containing in

particular f and the empty set . the precise choice of  and ch 

the theory. this choice is restricted by a series of consistency conditions,
which are derived from eqs.
(10)(13). firstly, admissible spin structure
assignments to the fermions must be such that the spercurrent j (and also
for j) has also a well-dened spin structure. in particular this implies that
 i the supercurrent j and the superghosts, as well

for any assignment ch 

 is dene

7

as the d fermion eld s all have the same spin structure h ()

the d fermion eld s are either all in the set  or all not in the set. the
second condition is that for all , , etc.  :

() i. all

n() = 0 mod8,
n() = 0 mod4,
n() = 0 mod2.

finally the coecients ch

ch

 i = 2
 i = ch

(14)

(15)

note that conditions (14) ensure the consistency of eq. (15). for our later
use one can derive the following useful formula:

ch  + 



i = (1)(, ) expni

2

n()o ch 

 ich 
 i.

(16)

by carefully analysing the spectrum of non-interacting string states, it
was found that a string model has a massless gravitino if and only if there
exists a set s   such that the following two conditions are satised [10]:

1. s is a set of precisely eight left fermions including  (not counting the
two longitudinal fermions) or a set of precisely eight right fermions including
;

2. for any set x   satisfying x  s = , we must have

ch s

x i = (1)x(, ).

(17)

the model we will study in detail in this paper is constructed in [6] and

it is given by the following generating sets:

b0 = f = {=0,,3, i=1,,6, yi=1,,6, i=1,,6,

8

=0,,3, i=1,,6, yi=1,,6, i=1,,6},

b1 = {=0,,3, i=1,,6},
b2 = { =0,,3, i=1,,6},
b3 = {i=1,,4, yi=1,,4, yi=1,,4, i=1,,4},
b4 = {yi=1,,4, i=1,,4, i=1,,4, yi=1,,4}.

(18)

to completely x the model we must specify what all these coecients

ch 

 is are. the strategy is the following: all models obtained by omitting

one or two generating sets b3 and/or b4 are supersymmetric. in particular the
model generated by the sets b0,1,2 has (4, 4) supersymmetry. this requires:

ch b1

b2 i = ch b2

b1 i = 1.

(see appendix a.) notice also that

b1  b4 = ,

and

b2  b3 = ,

(19)

(20)

from the general analysis, we will have a non-supersymmetric model if we
have

(21)

ch b1

b4 i = 1,

and

ch b2

b3 i = 1.

we will not analyse the spectrum of this model [6] here. an analysis of
the gravitini is given in appendix a. for this model it was proved that
the one-loop cosmological constant is zero even before the integration over
the moduli space parameter  . we will give a complete proof in the next
section. the method will be used in our explicit computation of the two-loop
cosmological constant (which is non-vanishing before the integration over the
moduli space).

3 one-loop cosmological constant

the one-loop cosmological constant was given in (9). what we will prove is
that the cosmological constant is zero even before the integration over the

9

moduli  . so we can rst consider the following expression:

1

v = x,
= x,0
 yf f 

ch 
1/2h (f )

 + nb3 + mb4 i
xn,m,n, m=0
1/2h ( + nb3 + mb4)(f )
( + nb3 + mb4)(f ) i1/2

( ).

(22)

in the above expression we have separated the summation over b3 and b4
from the summation over 0 which is dened as the set generated by the sets
i=0 nibi|ni = 0, 1}. now setting    + n1b1 + m1b2 and

   + n2b1 + m2b2, we do a resummation over b1 and b2:

v =

(23)

dening v [ ] in an obvious notation. it is easy to prove the following property
for v [ ]:

vh  + nb3 + mb4

 + nb3 + mb4 i = vh  + nb3 + mb4 + n1b1 + m1b2
 + nb3 + mb4 + n2b1 + m2b2 i,

0  {  0|  b1 =   b2 = } = {, f + b1 + b2}. by using the the

for any n1, n2, m1, m2 = 0, 1 and ,   0. now we dene a subset 
0: 
above property of v we can restrict the summation over  and  to 
0:

v = x,

0 xn,m,n, m=0,1

vh  + nb3 + mb4
 + nb3 + mb4 i.

(25)

in the following we will prove that all these v [ ]s are identically zero.
before doing this let us rst classify all these dierent v [ ]s according to their

10

modular transformation property. in fact all these v [ ]s can be classied into
ve categories. they are:



1) vh 
 i
2) vh  + b3
5) vh  + b3
vh  + b3 + b4

 + b3 i and vh  + b3
 + b3 i;
 + b3 + b4 i, vh  + b4
 + b3 + b4 i, vh
 + b3 i,

 + b4

 + b3

all the v [ ]s in the same category can be transformed into each other
by modular transformations. this can easily be shown by making use of the
following generating modular transformations at one-loop:

h a
h a

b i( )
b i( )

s h b

a i(1/ ),
a + b + 1 i( + 1).

and we have

the following demonstrates how we transform vh  + b3

vh  + b3 + b4
i by a series of modular transformations:
vh  + b3

(30)

(31)

with  =  +  + b0 + b1 + b2 and  = . one easily ckecks that

,   

0 =   
0.

after this detour we can prove the vanishing of all v [ ]s in one category
by just proving the vanishing of just one of the v [ ] in this category. modular
transformation ensures the vanishing of all the other v [ ]s because they are
related with each other by modular transormations.

the vanishing of v [ ]s in the rst 4 categories is automatic because of
supersymmetry. on the other hand the vanishing of v [ ]s in the fth cat-
egories is because there always exists an odd spin structure in the theta
function product. let us prove these assertions in the following.

now we separate the transverse fermions f  into three non-intersecting sub-
sets b1, b2 and f  + b1 + b2. then we have1

in the next section we extend the above reasoning to two-loop computa-
tions, but we will nd a non-vanishing result for the cosmological constant
before the integration over the moduli space.

4 two-loop cosmological constant

as we recalled above, in two-loop computation another factor must be in-
serted into the sum over the even spin structures, representing the supercur-
rent correlator related to the occurrence of superghost zero modes (the odd
spin structures give a trivially zero contribution in this case too). its exact

14

form is quite involved, however for checking the vanishing of the cosmologi-
cal constant we only need few relevant facts, which we will recall here. the
computation of the two-loop cosmological constant (the left part) follows the
standard strategy [3, 13, 8] of rst integrating over the supermoduli by choos-
ing the super-beltrami dierentials to be -functions in moduli independent
points x1,2 on the riemann surface. one thus obtains for the left part of the
integrand (to be integrated over the moduli of the surface, represented by
three of the branch points ai, the other three being xed by the sl(2, c)
projective invariance, see below):

(45)
where det j stands for the usual chiral determinant and 3/2
a (x), a = 1, 2
are the holomorphic 3/2-dierentials. all the determinants, the correlators
and 3/2-dierentials appearing in eq.
(45) can be explicitly expressed in
the hyperelliptic description, where the genus g = 2 riemann surface is
represented as lower and upper (compactied) sheets of the function

(det 1/2)1/2
s(f ),

y2(z) =

6

(z  ai),

yi=1

(46)

and the branch points ai dene three branch cuts in each sheet. three ai can
be xed by sl(2, c) projective invariance and the other three are taken to
be moduli. the two independent holomorphic one-forms wi(z) can be taken
to be

w1(z) =

,

w2(z) =

.

(47)

y(z)

y(z)

as in ref. [3] we choose the positions x1,2 of the super-beltrami dierentials
to be the two simple zeros of w1, i.e. x1 =  in the upper sheet and x2 = 
in the lower sheet respectively. in this language the even spin structures are
equivalent to ten dierent splitting of the six branch points {ai}, i = 1,    , 6
into two non-ordered sets {ai}, {bi}, i = 1, 2, 3.

with a convenient normalization [3] we have det 3/2

a (xb) = 1, and the
spin-structure dependent part of hj(x1)j(x2)i is carried by the expressions

y1[s()]  2 h(x1)(x2)is() =

(49)

coming from the j =   x and jgh part of eq. (5) (see ref. [3] for details).
similarly, the compactied sector contribution is

hj(x1)j(x2)is() = 

6

xi=1

y1[s(i)] y1[s(yi)] y1[s(i)].

(50)

with all these expressions in hand we can write

6

hj(x1)j(x2)is() = k1 y1[s()]+k2 y2[s()]

y1[s(i)] y1[s(yi)] y1[s(i)],

(51)
where kis are spin structure independent (to be precise kis are symmetric
for every ai  aj interchange).

by using the above hyperelliptic representation of the genus 2 riemann
surface, one can compute all the determinants in (45) explicityly and we have
the following result for vl:

xi=1

vl =

(det k)d/2qi<j aij

hj(r+)j(r)is() yf f 

l

q1/8
s(f ),

(52)

where we have put x1 = r+ and x2 = r, meaning two arbitrary points (not
necessarily at ) on the lower and upper sheets of the complex plane. also
the quantity qs is proportional (with a spin structure independent factor),
by means of the thomae formula [14] to 4
s(0). in terms of the above sets
{ai}, {bi} we have:

qs =

3

yi<j

(ai  aj)(bi  bj).

(53)

by using this result we can write down the two-loop cosmological constant
as follows:

 = z

d2

t d/2qi<j |aij|2 x,

ch 

 ihj(r+)j(r) j(s+) j(s)is(, ) yf f 

q1/8
s(f ),

(54)

16

where d2 = q6
qi<j
dv = d2aid2aj d2ak
|aijajkaki|2

i=1 d2ai
|aij |2 dv is the measure of the two-loop moduli space and
is the innitesimal volume of the sl(2, c) tranformation.
in type ii superstring the correlator hjj j ji is not completely left-right
factorized. however as far as its spin structure dependence is concerned
(i.e. what is relevant to check the zero of the cosmological constant) it is a
sum of factorized pieces. therefore, since we will check separately the terms
containing y1 and y2, we can assume the supercurrent correlator, denoted for
short xlong,3/2, to be eectively factorized: xlong,3/2  hjj j ji = hjjih j ji.
only when we want the complete expression for the cosmological constant,
we should take into account this left-right coupling.

organization of the computation

at two loops one can do a resummation over b1 and b2 just as we did at one
loop order, by making use of the same subsets 0 and 
0 introduced at one
loop. we have

as in one-loop computation we classify all the v [ ]s into 6 categories (see

appendix b). they are (i, i  

0):

the total number of dierent v [ ]s (not counting dierent i, j  
0)
is (22)4 = 256 which is the right number of dierent v [ ]s in the above
classication.

computing the various terms

4.1 the susy preserving terms.

the v [ ]s in the rst 4 categories are zero because of supersymmetry. this
was proved rigorously in [4]. we will give the proof in the appendix c. this
is a useful exercise because we will see quite clearly the dierence between
the supersymmetric model and the non-supersymmetric model.

we note that this proof makes use of the following identities (i = 1, 2):

0 0 i! q1/2h 0 0

 yih 0 0
0 0 i  yih 1 0
 yih 0 1
 yih 0 0

0 0 i  yih 1 1
0 1 i  yih 1 0

0 0 i q1/2h 1 0
0 0 i
0 0 i q1/2h 1 1
0 0 i
0 1 i q1/2h 1 0
0 1 i = 0, (56)

0 0 i! q1/2h 0 1
0 1 i! q1/2h 0 0

which was conjectured in [9] and proved explicitly in [4].

18

4.2 the terms containg an odd theta-function.

now we prove the vanishing of vh 1 + b3 2

1 + b4 2 i. we have

vh 1 + b3 2

1 + b4 2 i  yf f +b1+b2

1/2h (1 + b3)(f ) 2(f )
(1 + b4)(f ) 2(f ) i.

(57)

the strategy to prove the vanishing of the above expression is to show that
there always exist at least one odd spin structure for the -function. as we
proved in section 2, for any choice of 1 and 1, one can nd fermionic

1 + b4 i = h 1
1 0 i, h 1 1

eld f in b = f + b1 + b2 such that h 1 + b3
(1 + b4)(f ) 2(f ) i takes the values h 1 0
h (1 + b3)(f ) 2(f )
2 i = h 
 i, h b
h 2
for h 2
2 i = h b

1 i. for such f ,
1 1 i for
b i respectively. all these are odd spin structures.

 i or h 
b i, we have
(1 + b4)(f ) 2(f ) i = h (1 + b3)(f ) 1
h (1 + b3)(f ) 2(f )
(1 + b4)(f ) 1 i.

1 0 i or h 1 0

(58)

to have a possibly non-vansihing result, this must be an even spin structure
for all f  b. this requires

(1 + b3)(f ) = (1 + b4)(f ) = 1, f  b,

in particular this implies

(1 + b3)  (b) = b,
which is not the case for any choice of 1  

0 = {, b}.

(59)

(68)

we draw the attention of the readers to the dierence between eq. (56) and
eq. (68). its the minor (but crucial) sign dierence on the third line which
gives a non-vanishing result. we have

vi = 2  yih 0 0

= (ai

0 1 i! q1/2h 0 0

0 1 i q1/2h 1 0
0 1 i

3) q1/2h 0 0

0 1 i q1/2h 1 0
0 1 i,

(69)

if we set r =  (the left supercurrent insertion points). similar calculation
can be done also for the right part. the result is

vi = (ai

4  ai

5) q1/2h 0 0

1 0 i q1/2h 0 1
1 0 i,

if we set r =  (the right supercurrent insertion points).

by combining the left and right part, the result is

vijh b3

 i = ai

45(a134526a164325)|(124|356)2(135|246)|,

(70)

(71)

where aijklmn  aijajkaklalmamnani and similarly for aijklmn. here we have
used the explicit expression for q eq.(53 ) and droped all other non-essential
factors.

21

for other i, we can do similar calculation and the results are:

23aj

45(a124536a164235)|(134|256)2(125|346)|,

23aj

45(a135426a165324)|(125|346)2(134|256)|,

i = ai
i = ai









23aj

45(a125436a165234)|(135|246)2(124|356)|.

from the above results, we observe a general pattern for the non-vanishing

amplitude. by comparing eq. (71) with eq. (72) we see that vijh b + b3
can be obtained from vijh b3

 i
 i by a modular transformation a2  a3. we

also note that under this transformation a164325 changes to a164235. there
is one other sign change from the left part: ai

all the other non-vanishing amplitude can all be obtained from this sin-

gle vijh b3

 i non-vanishing expression by doing all the possible dierent

modular transformations. to prove this claim we introduce the following
denition:



vij(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6)
3  aj

2  ai

5)( aj

 (ai

4)(a1a2a3a4a5a6)( a1 a6 a3 a2 a5 a4)

|(a1a3a5|a2a4a6)2(a1a2a4|a3a5a6)|.

(75)

where (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6) is a permutation of (a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6) and
(a1a2a3a4a5a6)  (a1a2)(a2a3)(a3a4)(a4a5)(a5a6)(a6a1),
etc. it is easy to prove the following property of vi:

vij(a6, a5, a4, a3, a2, a1) = vij(a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6).

(76)

by using this property, the number of dierent vij is 6!/2 = 360. this is
exactly the number of non-vanishing v [ ]s: 90  4 = 360 because every v [ ]
from the 6th category (there are 90 dierent of them in this category) would
give 4 non-vanishing terms as we explicitly showed in eqs. (71)(74).

22

by summing over all these permutations  we nally get the following

non-vanishing and explicitly modular invariant expression

vij = x

vij((a1), (a2), (a3), (a4), (a5), (a6)),

(77)

which gives contribution to the integrand of the two-loop cosmological con-
stant. we see no reason why a non-vanishng integrand should give a vanishing
cosmological constant after the integration over the moduli space.

appendix a: analysis of the gravitini content
of the model

here we show that in the model of eq. (18) there are no gravitini in the free
spectrum. the analysis is done by looking at the one-loop partition function.
first, note that

tr ()rnsf +  yf f

1/2h (f )
(f ) i,

(78)

with a self-explanatory notation. therefore the partition function can be
written as

(79)

z  x,

ch 

 itr ()rnsf +.

now by writing  =  + nibi with ni = 0, 1 and using eq. (15) and denoting
  ()(, ), we have

z  x, 

tr () ch 

 i(cid:16)1 + ()bich 

bi i(cid:17)rnsf +.

(80)

of course now  runs over the set else than bi. we iterate this procedure for
other base elements bj until

ch 

 i  ch 

 i = ,

(81)

23

(the last equality follows from eq. (15)), and nally we get the following
projections:



z  x

n

yi=0

1

2(cid:16)1 + ()bich 

bi i(cid:17)rnsf +.

(82)

now we see that taking  = b1 (see eq. (18)) and bi = b2, b3 for susy/nonsusy
models we get

tr

1

2(cid:16)1  ()b3(cid:17) 

1

2(cid:16)1  ()b2 ch b1

b2 i(cid:17)rb1nsf +b1.

(83)

this means that a massless state could be obtained by taking the vacuum
in the left sector (ramond for the fermions in b1 thus including the space-
time left fermions and neveuschwarz for the other left fermions: thus get-
ting a spacetime spinor) and exciting one neveuschwarz lowest mode of the
spacetime right fermions (thus a spacetime vector). because b2 contains the
spacetime right fermions, all gravitino states are not projected out by the rst

projection if ch b1

b2 i = 1. on the other, since b3 does not contain spacetime

right fermions this gravitino state is projected out in the nonsusy model.

appendix b: the classication of the two-loop
terms into modular invariant sets

here we organize the various contributions in modular invariant sets, that
is we put in the same set contributions related by modular transformations.
we denote a one-loop spin structure by

h a
b i.

(84)

a two-loops spin structure can be denoted by the tensor product of two
one-loop spin structures:

h a1 a2

b2 i  h a1

b1 i h a2
b2 i.

b1

(85)

as we have seen, we have to consider the cases when a(b) =  + nb3,4 ( +
0 = {, f + b1 + b2}. let us for short take  =  = .

at one-loop the following three are related by modular transformations:

(we are interested in the case when v = b3, b4, b3 + b4). thus we consider

are all modular related, for u 6= v and u, v = b3, b4, b3 + b4, for a total of 6

 i for the 3 elements. similarly the various h v

elements: we take as representative h b3
b4 i.

the two-loops modular transformations (see below) give the relations, for

u 6= v and u, v = b3, b4:

 i  h 



h v
 i h v
h v
 i h v + u

u i  h 



(87)

(88)

(89)

(90)

(91)

in conclusion we get the 6 categories written in sect.4organization
of the computation, each category being a set of elements with the given

multiplicity. for instance, h 1 + b3 2
h 
 i h v
 i,

 i h v
h v
 i,

2 i is obtained from
 i h 
h v
 i

1

(92)

for a total of 33+23 = 15 modular related terms. for the other categories
we have a similar counting: 2  (6 + 3  (3  6)) = 120 terms for the category
5) and 6  6 + 2  (3  (3  3)) = 90 terms for the category 6).

25

finally, the two-loop modular transformation we have used above is:

qh a1 a2

b1

b2 i x qh

a2

a1

a2 + b1 a1 + b2 i,

which would give the following modular transformation for v [ ]:

vh 1 2

1 2 i x vh

2 + 1 1 + 2 i.

(93)

(94)

the other generating modular transformations are just one-loop like modular
transformations which change only one column of the characteristics of the
theta function, i.e. qs. these are denoted as t1,2 and s1,2 in an obvious nota-

tion. the following example demonstrates how we change vh 1 + b3 2 + b4
to vh 1 + b4

now we need the following coecient:

ch 1 + b3 + n1b1 + m1b2 2 + n2b1 + m2b2
2 + n2b1 + m2b2 i

1 + n1b1 + m1b2

1 + n1b1 + m1b2

= ch 1 + b3 + n1b1 + m1b2
= (1)n2+n2+m2+ m2 ch 1 + b3

again we nd a splitting of the left and right parts in eq. (99). for the left
part we have

(101)

in the above there appears two dierent spin structures in q. these two
spin structures should both be even in order to have a possibly non-vanishing
result. this requires n1 = 0 and we have

which was proved explicitly in [4]. similar method can be used to prove the
vanishing of all v [ ]s in the 3rd and 4th categories.
