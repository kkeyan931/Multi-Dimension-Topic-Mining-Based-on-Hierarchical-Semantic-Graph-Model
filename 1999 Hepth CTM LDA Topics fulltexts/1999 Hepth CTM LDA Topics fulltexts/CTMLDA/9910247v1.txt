park and ho [1] correctly point out an error in the surface term (9) of ref. [2], and the
consequent lack of antisymmetry in the poisson brackets (13) of that paper. the root of the
problem is that the surface term fails to make the action suciently dierentiable: the
dieomorphisms of interest, given by eqns. (17)-(18) of ref. [2], do not satisfy the boundary
conditions (described after eqn. (10)) needed in order for the total surface term in the
variation of the action to vanish. an interesting alternative has been proposed by sovoliev
[3], who suggests an approach to boundary terms that does not require dierentiability
of the action, but it is not clear to me whether this completely resolves the problem.

despite this error, however, the overall conclusion of ref. [2] remains valid. the relevant
surface terms have been analyzed more thoroughly, in a manifestly covariant manner, in
ref. [4], where it is shown that the virasoro algebra of ref. [2] is reproduced with the correct
values of central charge and l0 needed to explain black hole entropy. the details of the
relation between the covariant phase space approach of ref. [4] and the canonical approach
of ref. [2] have not yet been worked out, however. moreover, as ref. [4] demonstrates,
there are still unanswered questions concerning the proper generic boundary conditions for
a black hole horizon, so the subject cannot be considered closed.

while the the error pointed out by park and ho is a real one, their analysis is slightly
misleading in one respect. their criticism (b) implicitly assumes that because a nonrotating
black hole has no preferred angular direction, dieomorphisms like those of eqn. (18) of
ref. [2] should be taken to be independent of angular coordinates. but as observed in ref.
[4], the generator of dieomorphisms (with the correct boundary terms) exists only when
an angular dependence is included. for a static black hole, this angular dependence is
nearly arbitrarydierent choices lead to isomorphic virasoro algebrasbut it cannot be
neglected. as a result, criticism (b) is not valid.

the comment by park and ho also raises an interesting issue that deserves to be in-
vestigated further. their anomalous boundary contribution to the transformation of, for
example, grr is determined by looking at the variation l[] of the generator of dieomor-
phisms and extracting the coecient of rr. this certainly seems to be a valid procedure.
on the other hand, however, the relevant variation l[] is

l[]  zr=r+

if one uses the boundary conditions (3) and (4) of ref. [2], one nds that this variation
vanishes. park and ho obtain a nonzero contribution to grr because they divide l[],
which vanishes at r = r+, by rr, which also vanishes.

now, in the standard approach of regge and teitelboim [5] to surface terms and adm
mass, one computes the variation l[], takes an appropriate limit to go to a boundary such
as spatial innity, and then uses the limiting variation to determine a boundary term. what
park and ho have demonstrated is that this process does not necessarily commute with
the process of functionally dierentiating to obtain poisson brackets. it may be that this
paradox can be resolved by correctly incorporating boundary conditions into the denition
of dirac brackets, but further investigation seems warranted.
