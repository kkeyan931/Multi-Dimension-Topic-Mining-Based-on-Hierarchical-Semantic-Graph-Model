abstract

by a toroidal compactication with a vortex like conguration of
tachyon elds, the unoriented bosonic string in 26 dimensions becomes
equivalent to 10 dimensional string theory with gauge group so(32)
g where g has rank 16. the reduction from so(8192) to so(32) is
induced by the action of non-abelian wilson lines which twists the
tachyon. the additional enhanced gauge symmetry g appears from
closed string sector by frenkel-kac construction. we also examine the
consistency of the tachyon condensation.

1 introduction

some years ago, it was found [1] [2] [3] that the unoriented bosonic string
theory with gauge group so(213) = so(8192) meets tadpole cancellation
condition. although it is interesting to observe that a consistent string theory
exists with such a simple eld content, it is far from realistic because of the
existence of tachyon and the large gauge group.

recent development of string theory show that a paradigm that every
tachyon free, modular invariant string theories (type iia/b, type i, and het-
erotic string) should be regarded as dierent limits of moduli of one unifying
model, say m theory. at this moment, however, it is still dicult to un-
derstand the status of the modular invariant but tachyonic theories such as
bosonic, type o, oa/b, and some heterotic models. the key issue is how to
make physical interpretation of tachyons.

starting from the study of stable non-bps sates [4]-[9], sen began to
clarify the meaning of tachyon. in parallel d-brane - anti-d-brane system,
tachyon plays the role of the higgs elds in the system with spontaneous
symmetry breaking. by tachyon condensation with topologically nontrivial
winding, d-(p  2)-brane appears at the core of vorticity after pair annihi-
lation of d- and anti d-branes. a geometrical basis of such a mechanism
was explored by witten [10] in the language of k-theory.

the purpose of this letter is to analyze a possibility that such a mecha-
nism may be applied to bosonic so(8192) theory. the idea is very simple.
originally, the theory has 213 = 8192 25-branes. after the tachyon conden-
sation, the number of branes should be reduced by halves and dimensions
of branes will be decreased by two. if we repeat this step 8 times, we get
reduction of 213 branes to 25 = 32 branes. if we choose the momentum lat-
tice of toroidal compactication, an extra gauge symmetry g of rank 16 may
appear from the closed string sector. if we take g = so(32) the system has
the same gauge group as that of the type 0 theory [12] and toroidal com-
pactications of oriented bosonic closed string. in this way, one may include
so(8192) theory into a family where a reasonable treatment of remaining
tachyon is being developed recently from ads/cft correspondence [13].

in [11] sen has created a method to treat tachyon condensation as a
deformation of boundary conformal eld theory (bcft). by following him,
we will use three steps to explicitly describe tachyon condensation.

1. find a insertion of wilson line which will make tachyon mode anti-

1

periodic in the compactied directions. it creates a kink in that direc-
tion.

2. find a radius where tachyon vertex has dimension one where it becomes

marginal operator.

3. realize tachyon condensation as the deformation of bcft.

sen [11] has developed bcft of tachyon condensation where the dimension of
the brane will be reduced by one by merging two d-branes. straightforward
repetition of his method will reduce the number of branes by a factor of 216
while reducing the dimension of the branes by 16. since we have only 213
branes, it should be modied for our purpose. namely, we need to study the
process of pair annihilation of two d-(p + 2) branes to create one d-p-brane
just as in the superstring cases [7][10][8].

2 generalized kink conguration and nonabelian

wilson lines

for simplicity, we start from the reduction of two d-(p + 2)-branes. chan-
paton (cp) group is u(2) and we have four cp sectors labeled by i and i
(i = 1, 2, 3). we write two directions where reduction occurs as x1, x2. at
the core of the vorticity, tachyon should behave as1

t (x) = x11 + x22 + o(|x|2).

(1)

let us assume that x1 and x2 directions are toroidary compactied in a radius
r and try to achieve the rst step of sens scenario. it will be natural to
assume from (1) that tachyon eld t (x) is anti-periodic in xi direction when
its cp factor is i (resp.
i = 1, 2). we need to nd wilson lines which
generate such a change of boundary condition. we denote x i(z) the string
coordinates along the directions xi. consider the insertion of wilson line,

exp(cid:18)i


4

2i zx 1(z)dz(cid:19) ,

(2)

1 we used the analogy with the superstring case [10]. in bosonic situation, this does
not necessarily comes from topological requirement since both tachyons and gauge bosons
has u (2) cp factors. rather we use it simply as a generalization of the kink conguration.

2

at the boundary of the world sheet. although the states with cp factors
i and 2 are unaected, those with cp factors 1 and 3 get some shift of
momentum p1  p1  

2 , because of the commutation relation,

[2, 1  i3] = 2(1  i3).

(3)

more explicitly, if we write the zero-mode wave function of the open string

sector as

(x1, x2) =

3xi=0

i(x1, x2)i,

0 = 1,

(4)

the boundary condition is modied to,

(x1 + 2r, x2) = h1

(x1, x2)(h1

)(1),

h1
 = exp(i


2

r2).

(5)

momentum along x1 was originally quantized in the unit 1/r. therefore
if we choose  = 1/r we obtain desired anti-periodicity for the mode with
cp factor 1. the factor in the boundary condition becomes h1 = 2.

to get correct anti-periodicity along x2 direction, we need to include the

second wilson line,

exp(cid:18)i


4

1i zx 2(z)dz(cid:19) .

(6)

this time those modes with cp factor 2 and 3 get similar shift of their
momentum.

(x1, x2 + 2r) = h2

(x1, x2)(h2

)(1),

h2
 = exp(i


2

r1).

(7)

we choose  = 1/r again and the deformation factor becomes h2 =
1. the deformations factor for each wilson line become non-commutative
h1h2 6= h2h1. however, the action on the wave function becomes commuta-
tive and there is no ambiguity in the ordering. this happens because of the
specic choice of  we made. to summarize the combined eect, if we write
(, ) as the sign of (anti-)periodicity in x1 and x2 direction respectively,
four cp sectors are split into,

i : (++) 1 : (+) 2 : (+) 3 : ()

(8)

at this point, if we combine all the modes from each cp factor, the mo-
mentum distribution is identical to those of rectangular lattice with radius

3

2r as far as open string sector is concerned . if we take t-duality trans-
formation in x1 and x2 directions, one may alternatively view it as winding
mode of open string originating from one d-p-brane for radius 1/2r. in this
way, we obtained three equivalent descriptions for the same system.

1. two d-(p + 2)-branes with wilson lines compactied with the radius r

2. one d-(p + 2)-brane with the radius 2r

3. one d-p-brane with the radius 1/2r

such an equivalence, however, may not be straightforwardly interpreted
as the usual tachyon condensation scenario if we keep the closed string sector
in our mind. namely, the inclusion of wilson lines do not change the closed
string spectrum at all. therefore, closed strings still live in the space with the
radius r or its dual 1/r. it does not t with above brane number reduction
scenario. to realize a real reduction, we need to keep the original radius r
invariant. such a mechanism occurs only when we introduce the deformation
by tachyon elds. we will discuss this issue in section 4.

there is however a positive lesson from the above observation. we may
claim that the original u(2) symmetry is broken to u(1) contrary to the usual
situation where unbroken symmetry is u(1)u(1). the origin of such a phe-
nomena is that we introduced two wilson lines in mutually non-commuting
cp directions 1 and 2. for the reduction from o(8192) to o(32), this claim
is already enough and we do not need full tachyon condensation scenario.

while the gauge symmetry from open string sector is reduced, we may
choose the radius of the lattice to realize a new gauge symmetry from closed
string sector. by taking r = 1, we have two pairs of su(2) current algebras,

 = eix[i]
j [i]

,

j [i]
3 = x [i],

i = 1, 2.

(9)

this su(2) su(2) becomes the gauge symmetry of the space-time by using
standard frenkel-kac construction. 2

2gauge group is su (2)  su (2) instead of su (2)2

l  su (2)2

r since we consider

unoriented strings and half of gauge bosons are projected out.

4

3 application to so(8192) theory and reduc-

tion in one step

let us apply this idea to so(8192) model. to make the discussion clearer, we
compactify one extra dimension, say x 9 and apply t-duality transformation
along that direction. if we introduced an appropriate wilson line, those 8192
d-branes will be split into 4096 = 212 d-branes located at the same point, an
orientifold and mirror images of d-branes. the unbroken symmetry becomes
u(212). we may introduce non-abelian wilson lines to reduce the symmetry
to u(211). while repeating above procedure for 8 times, the number of branes
become 2128 = 24 = 16. together with orientifold plane, the surviving d-
branes dene so(32) theory. the extra gauge symmetry from the closed
string sector becomes su(2)16 if r = 1.

to compare this ten dimensional model with type 0 string theory, it is

necessary to deform momentum lattice su(2)16.

if we deform the lattice, it is not possible to use step by step method.
rather we need to develop the reduction of space-time in one step [10].
if we write xi (i = 1    16) our compact directions and x i as the string
variable associated with it. first let us consider rectangular 16 dimensional
lattice again. we prepare an explicit representation for gamma matrices in
16 dimensions (256 dimensional representation) as,

1 = 1  1      1
3 = 3  1      1
  
15 = 3  3      1

2 = 2  1      1
4 = 3  2      1

16 = 3  3      2.

(10)

together with these sets, we also need another representation,

e1 = 2  3      3
e3 = 1  2      3
e15 = 1  1      2

  

these matrices are chosen to satisfy,

e2 = 1  3      3
e4 = 1  1      3
e16 = 1  1      1.

(11)

[i, j ]+ = [ei,ej ]+ = 2ij ,

[i,ei]+ = 0,

[i,ej] = 0 (i 6= j).

(12)

5

the inclusion of wilson line,

16yi=1

exp(cid:18) i

4rei i zx idz(cid:19) ,

(13)

will modify the periodicity of tachyon in cp factor i to (+,    , +, , +,    , +)
where minus sign occurs only at i th position. in other word, we may have
condensation of tachyon in the following form [10] at xi = 0,

t (x) =

16xi=1

xi i + o(|x|2).

(14)

inclusion of wilson line (13) will invoke 216 sectors of cp factor split into
216 points in the half rectangular lattice.

it is now straightforward to generalize the argument to the skew lattice
case. to get gauge bosons from the closed string sector, we need to restrict
it to a self-dual lattice. we denote ~ei is the basis of lattice and ~fj as the
dual basis ~fi  ~ej = ij. the tachyon mode at the origin should behave as,

t (x) = xi

i sin( ~ei  ~x)  xi

i( ~ei  ~x)

(x  0).

(15)

wilson line that invokes such a tachyon mode is

16yi=1

exp(cid:18) i

2ei i ~fi  z ~xdz(cid:19) .

(16)

to obtain so(32), we take the original lattice as the so(32) lattice.

4 tachyon condensation scenario

we come back to the consideration of the reduction by two dimensions. so
far, there was no restriction on r from the open string sector. to examine
the scenario of tachyon condensation, we need to impose the tachyon vertex
to have dimension one.

tachyon elds in twisted direction have mode expansion,

t (x) = xmz

tm+1/2ei(m+1/2)x.

(17)

6

the mass squared of t1/2 mode is enhanced to,

m2 =

1
4r2  1.

(18)

at r = 1/2 they become massless and can be used to deform the boundary
conformal eld theory (bcft) [11].

the remaining analysis of tachyon condensation is almost parallel to [11]
and we will follow it step by step.
in this radius, the anti-periodic mode
ei2(x/2) denes su(2) current algebra. the vertex operator for the tachyon
condensation (1) is exactly this non-diagonal su(2) current and we need to
make nontrivial change of variable. we introduce the translation operators,

hi : x i  x i + ,

(i = 1, 2).

(19)

the eigenvalue of each cp sector under hi is given in (8). together with h,
we introduce another z2 operator g as,

gi : x i  x i .

(20)

from massless tachyon mode, we can construct su(2)2
algebra,

l  su(2)2

r current

e2ix i
e2iy i
e2iz i

l = yl + izl
l = xl  izl
l = xl + iyl,

(21)

for the left movers and the similar denition for the right movers. we dene
h and g operator similarly for y and z. there are some relations between
them,

hx = gy = gz,

gx = hy = hzgz.

(22)

the tachyon condensation is triggered by the inclusion of non-abelian wilson
line again,

exp(cid:18)i



4 i dzy1(z)1(cid:19) exp(cid:18)i



4 i dzy2(z)2(cid:19) .

(23)

this time, since we originally have both 1 eigenvalues for the operator
hy i , it is more natural to follow the change of the boundary condition in
the translations, x i  x i + 4r. wilson lines shifts h2
y i eigenvalues by

7

exp(2i). since we use the double period, shift of  by 1 will not change
the spectrum at all. at  = 1/2 they induces deformation factors 1,2 again
on the wave function. returning back to shift in 2r, the eigenvalues of hy
becomes i. we summarize the eigenvalues for gy and hy in the following
table.

hy 1 = gx1

gy 1 = hx1 hy 2 = gy 2

gy 2 = hx2

i
1
2
3

1
1
i
i

+

+


1
i
1
i

+
+



having four values 1, i for hy indicates that the momentum are ac-
tually quantized in dierent radius r = 2. of course in making such an
identication we need to combine the contributions from all the sectors. tak-
ing t-duality, we obtain a theory with one d-p brane with compactication
radius 1/2.

since we have come back to the original lattice, the resultant theory may
consistently couple to the closed string sector. of course, since we made
non-trivial change of variables for the open string sector, we need to carry
out similar task for closed string sector which seems to be quite non-trivial.
more important problem is that if we study the table more carefully on
gy eigenvalues, we immediately notice that we missed actually 3/4 of the
states! for example, for hy eigenvalue (, ), gy eigenvalues are xed as
(+, +) and eigenfunction should be parity even for y variables. of course,
there are no such restriction for the toroidal compactication in r = 1/2.

this phenomena may look like an artifact of the complicated way of
introducing non-commutative wilson lines. however it can be alternatively
explained by a simple argument. originally we have four degeneracy for each
momentum because of four cp factors. if we want to arrive at the change of
the radius r = 1/2  2 in two directions, the number of momentum mode
will be multiplied by 42 = 16. we can not ll all of those states but only 1/4
of them.

it is obviously necessary to clarify why such a missing states could come
out. a simple calculation reveals that there seems to be also a similar problem
in a superstring scenario.

5 discussions

although we can not use the usual scenario of the tachyon condensation,
we have shown that so(8192) theory compactied to ten dimensions may
have gauge symmetry so(32)  so(32). unfortunately, the eld content of
this theory is rather dierent from those theories. especially at the bottom
of the spectrum, we still have 528 (symmetric representation of so(32))
tachyons. since the number of the tachyon is essential to determine the
vacuum structure, it is hard to believe that these theories will have common
fate.

we are tempted to believe that the toroidal compactication to make
tachyon massless is indispensable for the stability of the system.
in anal-
ogy with standard higgs mechanism, this may be called as spontaneous
compactication of the space-time. although we discussed mainly the com-
pactication to ten dimensions, we believe that unoriented bosonic string will
unavoidably experience further compactication until it has only one tachyon
from open string mode. this means that we will have a compactication of
24 dimensions to leave only two uncompactied space-time. at this stage,
cp factor is just o(2) = u(1) but enhanced gauge symmetry may have rank
24. the nal fate of o(8192) theory should be claried by string theory
living in two dimensions. we have one real tachyon in the open string sector.
if one may deform it in kink conguration again, we would get a quantum
mechanics! however, the last tachyon is neutral in all cp factors, we can
not nd appropriate wilson line to deform it. the correct treatment is still
mysterious for us.
