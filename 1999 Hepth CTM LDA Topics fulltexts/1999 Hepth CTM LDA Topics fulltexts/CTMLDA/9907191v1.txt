n -particle quantum mechanics described by a sigma model with an n -dimensional

target space with torsion is considered. it is shown that an sl(2, ir) conformal symmetry
exists if and only if the geometry admits a homothetic killing vector daa whose associated
one-form dadx a is closed. further, the sl(2, ir) can always be extended to osp(1|2)
superconformal symmetry, with a suitable choice of torsion, by the addition of n real

fermions. extension to su (1, 1|1) requires a complex structure i and a holomorphic u (1)

involve a triplet of complex structures and su (2)su (2) isometries, are derived. examples

1. introduction

conformal and superconformal eld theories in various dimensions have played a cen-

tral role in our understanding of modern eld theory and string theory. oddly, the subject

of this paperone dimensionis one of the least well understood cases. the simplest

example of conformally invariant single-particle quantum mechanics was pioneered in [1].

supersymmetric generalizations were discussed in [27]. the quantum mechanics case has

taken on renewed interest because superconformal quantum mechanics may provide a dual

description of string theory on ads2 [8].

most of the discussions so far have concerned relatively simple systems either with

small numbers of particles or exact integrability. in this paper we consider a more general

class of models with n particles.

we begin in section 2 with a bosonic sigma model with an n -dimensional target space.

it is shown that the model has a nonlinearly-realized conformal symmetry if and only if
the target space metric has a vector eld daa whose lie derivative obeys

ldgab = 2gab,

and whose associated one-form is closed

d(dadx a) = 0.

(1.1)

(1.2)

given (1.1) and (1.2) it is shown that, in a hamiltonian formalism, the dilations are
generated by dapa while the special conformal transformations are generated by

k = 1

2 dada.

(1.3)

the conformal symmetry persists in the presence of a potential v obeying ldv = 2v.
a general class of examples is given.

in section 3 we turn to the supersymmetric case. the geometry of poincare-

supersymmetric quantum mechanics with a variety of supermultiplets was discussed by

coles and papadopoulos [9]. we restrict our attention to the case for which the multiplet
structure with respect to the poincare super-subgroup consists of n bosons x a with n real
superpartners a. such multiplets arise in the reduction of two-dimensional chiral (0, n )

multiplets, where n is the number of supersymmetries, to one dimension, and give rise to

what is sometimes referred to as type b models (most of the literature concerns type

1

a (n /2, n /2) multiplets). in section 3.1 we show that every bosonic conformal model

can be extended to an n = 1b theory with osp(1|2) superconformal symmetry provided

the torsion obeys certain constraints. in section 3.2 we consider n = 2b and nd that the

extension to su (1, 1|1) requires a complex structure i with respect to which d must be
bb is found to generate a u (1) isometry. in section 3.3 we rst derive
holomorphic. daia
a simplied version of the conditions for n = 4b poincare supersymmetry with an su (2)

r-symmetry as rst-order dierential relations between the triplet of complex structures
i r. we further show that an n = 4b model has a d(2, 1; ) superconformal symmetry if
the vector elds dai rb

a b generate an su (2) isometry group and obey generalizations of
the identities required for su (1, 1|1). the parameter  is determined by the constant in

the su (2) lie bracket algebra. in section 3.4 we construct a large class of n = 4b the-

ories in terms of an unconstrained potential l. d(2, 1; ) superconformal symmetry then

follows if l is a homogenous and su (2) rotationally-invariant function of the coordinates.

throughout the paper we use a hamiltonian formalism. in appendix a we give a la-

grangian derivation of the supercharges used in the text. we use real coordinates through-

out the body of the text, but appendix b gives various useful formulae for the geometry

and supercharges in complex coordinates. in appendix c we discuss the conditions under

which an n = 4b geometry can be written in terms of a potential l.

a primary motivation for this work is the expectation that quantum mechanics on

the ve-dimensional multi-black hole moduli space is an n = 4b theory with a d(2, 1; )

superconformal symmetry at low energies [10].

2. n = 0 conformally invariant n -particle quantum mechanics

in this section we nd the conditions under which a general n -particle quantum

mechanics admits an sl(2, ir) symmetry. we will adopt a hamiltonian formalism, and

derive the conditions for the existence of appropriate operators generating the symmetries.
the general hamiltonian is2

h = 1

2 p 

a gabpb + v (x).

(2.1)

g pag
2 the canonical momentum pa = gab x b = ia obeys [pa, x b] = ia
(for the norm (f1, f2) = r dn xgf 1 f2). in this and all subsequent expressions, the operator

b and p a = 1

ordering is as indicated.

2

where a, b = 1, . . . , n . we now determine the conditions under which the theory, dened

by equation (2.1), admits an sl(2, ir) symmetry.

we rst look for a dilational symmetry of the general form

this is generated by an operator

which should obey

dx a = da(x),

dt = t.

d = 1

2 dapa + h.c.

[d, h] = 2ih.

from the denitions (2.3) and (2.1) one nds

[d, h] = 

i
2

p 
a (ldgab)pb  ildv 

i
4

2ada,

where ld is the usual lie derivative obeying:

ldgab = dcgab,c + dc

,agcb + dc

,bgac.

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

therefore, given a metric g and potential v a dilational symmetry exists if and only if

there exists a conformal killing vector d obeying

and

ldgab = 2gab

ldv = 2v.

(2.7)

(2.8)

note that (2.7) implies the vanishing of the last term of equation (2.5). a vector eld d

obeying (2.7) is known as a homothetic vector eld, and the action of d is known as a

homothety.

next we look for a special conformal symmetry generated by an operator k(x) obey-

ing

and

[d, k] = 2ik,

[h, k] = id.

3

(2.9)

(2.10)

equations (2.9) and (2.10) together with (2.5) is an sl(2, ir) algebra. equation (2.9) is

equivalent to

while (2.10) can be written

ldk = 2k,

dadx a = dk.

hence the one-form d is exact. one can solve for k as

k = 1

2 gabdadb.

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

we shall adopt the phrase closed homothety to refer to a homothety whose associated

one-form is closed and exact.

an alternate basis of sl(2, ir) generators is

l0 = 1

l1 = 1

2 (h + k),
2 (h  k  id).

in this basis the generators obey the standard commutation relations

[l1, l1] = 2l0,

[l0, l1] = l1.

(2.14)

(2.15)

the nature of these geometries can be illuminated by choosing coordinates such that
(x 0)2 = 2k and gi0 = 0 for i = 1, . . . , n 1. this is always locally possible away from the
zeros of d. one then nds

ds2 = (dx 0)2 + (x 0)2gij(x k)dx idx j,

daa = x 0 

x 0 .

(2.16)

hence, given any metric gij in n  1 dimensions, one can construct a geometry with a

closed homothety in n dimensions by dressing it with an extra radial dimension. similar

comments pertain to the potential v .

an alternate useful choice is dilational coordinates, in which

da =

2
h

x a,

4

(2.17)

where h is an arbitrary constant. these are related to the coordinates in (2.16) by x 0 =
(x 0)2/h, x i = (x 0)2/hx i. in such dilational coordinates one nds

x aagbc =

h
2

ldgbc  x a

,cgba  x a

,bgac = (h  2)gbc.

(2.18)

hence in dilational gauge the metric components are homogeneous functions of degree

h  2. (it is not, however, the case that every homogeneous metric admits an sl(2, ir)

symmetry.) at this point h can be changed by transformations which take the coordinates

to powers of themselves, and so has no coordinate independent meaning. however, it turns

out that for n = 4b supersymmetry, a preferred value of h is obtained in quaternionic

coordinates, when such coordinates exist and coincide with dilational gauge, as in the class

of examples considered in section 3.4.

in conclusion, the hamiltonian (2.1) describes an sl(2, ir) invariant quantum me-

chanics if and only if the metric admits a closed homothety

ldgab = 2gab,

d(dadx a) = 0,

(2.19)

under which the potential transforms according to (2.8).

3. the supersymmetric case

in the following we supersymmetrize the bosonic sigma model by extending the boson
x a to the supermultiplet (x a, a) with a = a. a number of other multiplets exist [9]

which will not be considered in the following. furthermore we will set the potential v = 0.

an operator approach to a similar sytem can be found in [11].

3.1. n = 1b poincare supersymmetry and osp(1|2) superconformal symmetry

let us supersymmetrize the bosonic sigma-model (2.1) for v = 0 with n fermions 

where  = 1, . . . , n is a tangent space index. these obey the standard anticommutation

relations

{, } = ,

(3.1)

and of course commute with pa and x b. it is convenient to make the eld redenitions

a  pa 

abcbc,

(3.2)

a  ea

,
i

where  is related to the usual spin connection by abc = a



 ebe

c .3

a supercharge can then be constructed as4

q = aa 

i
6

cabcabc,

(3.3)

where c is a 3-form, which at this point is arbitrary. a derivation of the supercharge from

a supersymmetric lagrangian is given in appendix a. the supercharge obeys

{q, q} = 2h,

(3.4)

where the bosonic part of h agrees with (2.1) for v = 0.

we wish to extend this n = 1b poincare-superalgebra to the osp(1|2) superconformal

algebra whose non-vanishing commutation relations are

[h, k] = id,

[h, d] = 2ih,

[k, d] = 2ik,

{q, q} = 2h,

[q, d] = iq,

[q, k] = is,

{s, s} = 2k,

[s, d] = is,

[s, h] = iq,

(3.5)

{s, q} = d.

as before, the bosonic subalgebra requires a closed homothety. the new supercharge can

then be constructed as

s = i[q, k] = ada.

with k given by (2.13). the {s, q} anticommutator is then used to nd

{s, q} = d = 1

2 (daa + h.c.) 

i
2

dcccabab.

then, [s, d] = is is satised, but the [q, d] commutator is

[q, d] = iq + icabcdabp c + o(3).

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

3 we note that [a, b] = 

acc,
where  is the christoel connection. the hilbert space can be viewed as a spinor (as is seen

2 rabcdcd, [pa, b] = i(a

1

b

c  b

ac)c and [a, b] = ib

by identifying equation (3.1) with the -matrix algebra) and a as the covariant derivative on

hilbert space states.

4 despite the non-hermiticity of a, this expression is hermitian with the indicated operator

ordering.

6

agreement with (3.5) then requires c to be orthogonal to d:

dacabc = 0,

(3.9)

and so the last term of equation (3.7) vanishes. given (3.9), the full commutator becomes

[q, d] = iq +

1
6

abc(ld  2)cabc.

we therefore demand that c transform under dilations as

ldcabc = 2cabc.

(3.10)

(3.11)

the remaining commutators in (3.5) then follow from the jacobi identities, with no further

constraints on the geometry.

in summary any n = 0 conformal quantum mechanics can be promoted to osp(1|2),

but the torsion c appearing in the supercharges must obey

dacabc = 0,

ldcabc = 2cabc.

(3.12)

3.2. n = 2b poincare supersymmetry and su (1, 1|1) superconformal symmetry

n = 2b supersymmetry requires a complex structure i and a hermitian metric on

the target space [9]. the relevant formulae are simplest in complex coordinates. however

complex coordinates are less useful in the extension to the 4b case (which has an su (2)

triplet of complex structures) considered in the next subsection. accordingly we continue

with real coordinates, but give the complex version in appendix b.

the second supercharge is given by

q = aia

bb +

i
6

abcia

dib

eic

f cdef +

i
2

acabci bc.

(3.13)

a derivation is given in appendix b. whereas c is unconstrained for n = 1b, for n = 2b
the vanishing of { q, q} requires [9]



(bic)

a = 0,

(3.14)

where the torsion connection  =   c is the christoel connection minus the torsion
c. in complex coordinates (3.14) can be solved for the (1, 2) part of c as

c|(1,2) =

j,

i
2

7

(3.15)

with

j = 1

2 ia

cgbcdx a  dx b.

(3.16)

the (0, 3) part of c must be closed under  but is otherwise unconstrained, and the (2, 1)

and (3, 0) parts are obtained by complex conjugation.

we wish to promote the n = 2b algebra to su (1, 1|1). this involves an additional

bosonic generator r which is the generator of the r symmetry group of the n = 2b

subalgebra. the non-vanishing commutation relations are given by (3.5), an identical set
of relations with both q and s replaced by q and s, together with

{ q, s} = r,

{ s, q} = r,

[r, q] = i q,

[r, q] = iq,

[r, s] = i s,

[r, s] = is.

(3.17)

as before closure of the algebra requires that the geometry must admit a closed

homothety, as well as the constraints (3.12) on c. commutation of the supercharges with

k leads to the superconformal charges

s = ada,
s = aia

bdb.

(3.18)

obtaining the correct commutator [d, q] = i q requires that the action of d preserves

the complex structure:

ldia

b = 0.

(3.19)

this is equivalent to the statement that d acts holomorphically. alternate forms of (3.19)

are

df if

acabcid

bie

id

acabc;

c = df if
j = 0.

(3.20)

it follows from (3.20), together with (3.9) and (3.15) that da = dbib

a generates a

holomorphic isometry

l dia

b = 0,

l dgab = 0,

(3.21)

as expected from [r, h] = 0. moreover the (2, 1) part of the torsion c is annihilated by
l d while the (3, 0) part has weight 2i.

r is determined from the commutator of q and s as

(3.22)

(3.24)

notice that r commutes with  in complex coordinates with h = 2.

all the remaining commutators (3.17) and (3.5) are satised without any additional

constraints.

in summary, there is an su (1, 1|1) symmetry if and only if, in addition to the osp(1|2)

constraints (2.19) and (3.12), and the n = 2b constraints, d preserves the complex

structure:

ldia

b = 0.

(3.25)

it further follows that da = dbib

a generates a holomorphic isometry.

3.3. n = 4b poincare supersymmetry and d(2, 1; ) superconformal symmetry

remarks on n = 4b poincare supersymmetry

extending the algebra to include 4 supersymmetries requires 3 complex structures i r,

r = 1, 2, 3. with each i r one can associate a generalized exterior derivative

dr = dx ai r
a

br

b,

where the connection r appearing in r is5

ra

bc = i ra

d ci rd
b .

(3.26)

(3.27)

5 r dened in this way gives a connection acting on forms as described but not on general

tensors.

9

one of the conditions for n = 4 supersymmetry found in [9,12] can be expressed

{dr, ds} = 0.

(3.28)

these are the vanishings of the nijenhuis tensors and concomitants.6 in complex coordi-
nates adapted to i r, r vanishes and dr=i( ). equation (3.28) further implies

additional requirements for supersymmetry discussed in [9,12] are

{dr, d} = 0.

gab = i rc

a i rd

b gcd ( r),

{i r, i s} = 2rs,

[a(i re

b c|e|cd])  2i re

[a [ecbcd]] = 0,



(bi ra

c) = 0.

(3.29)

(3.30)

(3.31)

(3.32)

(3.33)

in this last equation the torsion connection  =   c.

the commutators of i r are related to the r-symmetry group. we shall consider the

su (2) case7

[i r, i s] = 2rsti t.

(3.34)

this case is sometimes refered to as n = 4b supersymmetry, and arises in the reduction

of (0, 4) supersymmetry from two dimensions.

we now show, dening the two-forms

j r = 1

2 i r

a

cgbcdx a  dx b,

(3.35)

that the necessary and sucient conditions for n = 4b supersymmetry can be recast in

the simpler form

{dr, ds} = 0,

gab = i rc

a i rd

b gcd ( r),

(3.36)

(3.37)

6 so, theorem 3.9 of [13] implies that the vanishing of any two of these equations yields the

vanishing of all six.

7 we have employed an obvious summation convention in this equation. we hope that it will

be clear from the context when repeated indices should or should not be summed over.

10

i ri s = rs + rsti t,

d1j 1 = d2j 2 = d3j 3.

(3.38)

(3.39)

note that the last two conditions (3.32) and (3.33) which involve the torsion c have been

replaced by the condition (3.39) which is independent of c. let us write the torsion

appearing in (3.33) as

c =  1

2 d3j 3 + e

(3.40)

for some three-form e. it can be checked that the torsion connection with e set to zero
is the unique such connection annihilating i 3, and moreover has holonomy contained in
u (n/2). it follows that, in complex coordinates adapted to i 3, the condition (3.33) for

r = 3 reduces to

eij k = eijk = 0.

(3.41)

(this is the argument that led to equation (3.15).) on the other hand, adding the r = 1

plus or minus i times the r = 2 component of (3.33) yields

eijk = eijk = 0.

(3.42)

we conclude that e = 0 and c =  1
and c =  1
c =  1

2 d1j 1
2 d2j 2, from which (3.39) follows. conversely given (3.39), adding the torsion
2 d3j 3 to the christoel connection implies (3.33). it can be further checked that

2 d3j 3. by symmetry we must also have c =  1

this choice of c satisifes (3.32).

this single choice of torsion connection annihilates all three complex structures



b i r

c

a = 0.

(3.43)

in fact the condition (3.43) is equivalent to (3.39). it diers from (3.33) by the absence of

symmetrization but is nevertheless equivalent for n = 4b. equation (3.43) is refered to in

[12] as the weak hkt (hyperkahler with torsion) condition. we have shown that n = 4b

(which includes the condition (3.38)) implies weak hkt.

extension to d(2, 1; ) superconformal symmetry

we now turn to superconformal symmetry. it turns out that the relevant supergroup

is d(2, 1; ), where the parameter 6=1 will be determined by the geometry. in order to

write down the commutators, it is convenient to dene the four-component supercharges
qm = (qr, q) and sm = (sr, s) for m = 1, 2, 3, 4; these transform in the (2, 2) of the

11

su (2)  su (2) r-symmetry group of n = 4b. operators qm, sm, h, d, k and rr

 (to

be described) then comprise the d(2, 1; ) algebra. the non-vanishing commutators are

[h, k] = id,

[h, d] = 2ih,

[k, d] = 2ik,

{qm, qn} = 2hmn,

[qm, d] = iqm,

[qm, k] = ism,

{sm, sn} = 2kmn,

[sm, d] = ism,

[sm, h] = iqm,

[rr

(3.44)

(3.45)

[t+r, ts] = 0,

[tr, ts] = rsttt,

{tr, ts} =  1

2 rs.

(3.46)

notice that when  = 0 or  = , one of the two su (2)s can be decoupled, and there is

an su (1, 1|2) subalgebra.

since d(2, 1|) has three su (1, 1|1) and one n = 4b subalgebra, the (previously

discussed) conditions on the geometry for the existence of those subgroups can all be

assumed. in particular, d must now be holomorphic with respect to all three complex

structures

ldi rb

a = 0.

(3.47)

expressions for qr and sr are then of the su (1, 1|1) forms (3.13) and (3.18) with i replaced
by i r. somewhat lengthy expressions for rr
 as a function of  then follow from linear
combinations of {qm, sn} anticommutators as determined by (3.44).8 obtaining properly
normalized su (2) algebras for the operators rr

 so determined requires

(3.48)

(3.49)

8 in principle, we should treat  = 0 or  as special cases. in fact,  =  cannot be realized
with the supermultiplet we are considering. for  = 0, the logic is slightly dierent but the results

are the same.

12

equation (3.48) can be taken as the denition of the constant h.9 since the normalization
of dr is xed in terms of d, h is a coordinate-invariant parameter associated to the

geometry.

reproducing the proper [r, q] commutators leads to the stronger requirement

(3.50)

in fact (3.50) (including r = s) implies both (3.48) and (3.47). using (3.50) one then nds

(3.52)

the torsion c can be eliminated from (3.51) using the identity drcccab = j r

2 (drdk)ab.
using the jacobi identity, the remaining commutators follow with no further con-

ab  1

straints on the geometry.

we note that equations (3.50) and (3.43) imply

2(h + 2)j r = h(drdk  1

2 rstdsdtk),

4(h + 2)c = hd1d2d3k.

(3.53)

properties of dr and d then imply equation (3.39), which thus needs not be taken as a

further condition.

we also nd, in quaternionic coordinates and dilational gauge, when such coordinates

exist, that

[rr

[rr

(3.54)

[rr

[rr

in summary, a quantum mechanical theory has n = 4b supersymmetry if and only

if the complex structure and metric obey equations (3.36)(3.39). the torsion c is then

uniquely determined as

c =  1

2 d3j 3.

h = , for which the algebra (3.48) is clearly singular.

3.4. examples of d(2, 1; ) quantum mechanics

in this subsection, we show that a large class of examples of quantum mechanical

systems with d(2, 1; ) symmetry (and an integrable quaternionic structure) can be con-

structed from a potential l. in an n = 2 superspace formalism (not described here, but

similar to the ones in [14,15]) l turns out to be the superspace integrand.

ir4 has an obvious su (2) triplet of complex structures associated to self-dual two-
forms obeying (3.38). let i r be the generalizations to ir4n . we may then dene a triplet
of fundamental two-forms by

j r =

1
8

(2drdl  rstdsdtl).

(3.58)

it follows immediately from this denition and {dr, ds} = 0 that the j r obey (3.39).
moreover the associated metric gab = i r
ac ( r) can be written (in a coordinate system
b
in which the i r are constant)

cj r

gab =

1

ad
4(cid:0)c

b + i r
a

ci r
b

d(cid:1)cdl.

(3.59)

this expression is manifestly hermitian. in other words for any l we can construct an
n = 4b quantum mechanics.10

it is natural to ask whether or not every weak hkt

geometry is described by some potential l. this is related to the integrability of the

quaternionic structure, as discussed in appendix c.

10 although one may wish in addition to impose positivity of the metric g, which further

constrains l.

14

the full d(2, 1; ) symmetry follows by imposing

where h is an arbitrary constant and

x aal = hl,

x ai rb

a bl = 0.

(3.60)

(3.61)

the rst condition implies that l is a homogenous function of degree h on r4n , while the

second states that it is invariant under su (2) r-symmetry rotations. these conditions

manifestly ensure the existence of the required homothety

daa =

2
h

x aa

(3.62)

as well as the su (2) isometries. remarkably, it follows from (3.60) and (3.61) with a little

algebra that d is automatically a closed homothety,

dadx a =

(h + 2)

2h

(al) dx a.

(3.63)

as discussed in section 2 this implies the existence of special conformal transformations

generated by

k = 1

2 gabdadb =

(h + 2)

2h

l.

(3.64)

in fact, all the requirements of (3.56) are automatically satised with these conditions, and
so indeed the full d(2, 1;  =  h+2

2 ) algebra is obtained.

the conditions (3.60) and (3.61) are sucient but not necessary to insure d(2, 1; )

invariance. more generally one could add to the right hand side anything which is in the

kernel of the second-order dierential operator in (3.58). this is especially relevant for

the interesting case h = 2, for which equations (3.63) and (3.64) show that the metric is

otherwise degenerate. an example of this will appear in [10].

the simplest case is

l = 1

2 abx ax b,

(3.65)

where a, b = 1, . . . , 4n . this has h = 2. the metric is then simply the at metric on r4n

ds2 = abdx adx b,

(3.66)

15

while the torsion c vanishes. the generators of d(2, 1;  1

2 )  osp(4|2) are then

h = 1

2 p apa,

q = apa,

s = axa,

k = 1

2 x axa,

qr = ai rb

we have, for ease of manipulation, written the fermions with spacetime indices, in deriving

only up to operator ordering. we have xed this ambiguity by demanding hermiticity and

target space covariance.

appendix b. n = 2b supersymmetry in complex coordinates

in this appendix we revisit the n = 2b supersymmetry of section 3.2 in complex

coordinates, which simplies the formulae and calculations. equation (3.15) for the (1, 2)

part of the torsion is

cij k = gi[j,k].

the (3, 0) part of the torsion is constrained by the relation

identities required of da are

appendix c. more on the geometry of weak hkt manifolds

in this appendix we will show that, given a weak hkt manifold with integrable

complex structures, we can nd a potential l. we will prove this shortly but rst we

should elaborate on the assumption that the quaternionic structure is integrable.

it is well known that,

for almost complex manifolds, the complex structure is

integrablethat is, there exists a coordinate system in which the components of the com-

plex structure are constantif and only if the nijenhuis tensor vanishes. the analogous

18

statement is not true for quaternionic manifolds; rather, the vanishing of the six nijenhuis

concomitants on a quaternionic manifold only guarantees the integrability of any one com-

plex structure. to see this (see also [16]), suppose that we work in a complex coordinate

system adapted to i 3. then, i 1 and i 2 have only mixed indices (i.e., as forms they are

(2, 0)  (0, 2) forms). now consider the connection [17,13] 11

ck

ij = i 1
l

kii 1
j

l

and

c.c.

(c.1)

the vanishing of the nijenhuis tensor implies that ck

ij is actually a symmetric connection.
furthermore, this connection vanishes in a basis (if one exists) in which i 1 and i 3 are

simultaneously constant, and so its curvature tensor vanishes in such a basis. thus, a

necessary condition for integrability of the quaternionic structure is the vanishing of the

curvature associated with the connection (c.1). obata [17] has shown that this is also a

sucient condition.

if we assume integrability of the quaternionic structure, then we can, without loss of

generality, work in a basis in which the complex structures are given by

i 1 = id wa 

i 2 = d wa 

i 3 = idza 


za  idza 

za  dza 

za + idwa 



wa  idwa 
 za + idza 



wa + dwa 
 za  dza 
 wa


 za  id wa 
wa  idza 


 wa ,



 wa

(c.2)

where we have split up the complex coordinates into two sets (za, wa), a = 1, . . . , n
4 .
hermiticity of the metric with respect to i 1 (we do not get any additional information

from i 2) implies that

gza zb = gwb wa;

gza wb = gzb wa = gz[a wb].

(c.3)

11 this is not identical to equation (3.27). equation (3.27) was written in a general coordinate
system, whereas the following equation is written in coordinates adapted to the i 3. thus, c

is a connection, provided one restricts oneself to holomorphic coordinate transformations, for c

depends implicitly on i 3, while 1 did not.

19

the condition that d1j 1 = d3j 3 then becomes12

gz[a wb, wc] = 0

gw[a zb ,wc] = 0

gw[a zb ,zc] = 0

gz[a z|c|, wb]  1
gza z[b ,zc]  1

2 gza wb ,zc = 0
2 gwb zc , wa = 0

gz[a wb,zc] = 0
gza z[b ,wc] + 1
gz[a z|c|,zb] + 1

2 gwb zc ,za = 0
2 gza wb ,wc = 0.

(c.4)

the rst and second lines of equation (c.4), when combined with the antisymmetry

in a, b of gza wb , allow us to write

gza wb = (za wb  zb  wa)l;

gwa zb = (wazb  wb za)l

(c.5)

where l is some real (by hermiticity of the metricand therefore identical in the two

equations (c.5)) function. inserting equation (c.5) into the third equation of (c.4) gives

and therefore,

 wb(cid:0)gza zc  l,za zc (cid:1)  (b  a) = 0,

gza zb = l,za zb + wa gzb

(c.6)

(c.7)

for some integration one-form gzb . combining this with the fourth equation of (c.4) gives
gzb = l,wb . thus we have obtained equation (3.59), which is the desired result.

we have shown that integrability of the quaternionic structure implies the existence

of a potential l for the metric. although equation (3.59) holds only in a coordinate

system in which the quaternionic structures are constant, equation (3.58) is coordinate

invariant. equation (3.53) motivates us to ask whether or not the existence of a potential

l obeying equation (3.58) is generically implied by the weak hkt conditions, independent

of integrability of the quaternionic structure.

12 again, we do not get any additional information from j 2, since d3j 3 is (1, 2)  (2, 1) and the
(2,1) and (1,2) parts of d2j 2 are trivially equal to those of d1j 1 and the (0,3) and (3,0) parts of
d2j 2 are just minus those of d1j 1.
