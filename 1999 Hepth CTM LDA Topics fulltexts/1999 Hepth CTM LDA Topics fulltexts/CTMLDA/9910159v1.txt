abstract

for background geometries whose metric contain a scale  we re-
formulate the born-infeld d-brane action in terms of   /(2).
this may be taken as a starting point for various perturbative
treatments of the theory. we study two limits that arise at zeroth
order of such perturbations. in the rst limit, that corresponds to
the gs   with  x, we nd a string parton picture, also in
the presense of some background rr-elds. in the second limit,
  0, we nd a topological model.

1 introduction

in this brief letter we study two limits of the born-infeld d-brane action.
we base the treatment on an expansion in a rescaled tension , and include
a full background.

we rst take a new look at a strong coupling limit (gs  ). this is
intended as a supplement to the discussion in [1] and [2] where the d-brane
world volume was shown to be foliated by string world sheets in this limit.
the result is a corroboration of the foliation picture plus the modied equa-
tions involving the background n-forms. in particular, we give an example
showing that the allowed string partons are either innite (which might
correspond to d1-branes), closed or open strings ending on other d-branes
(sources of the rr-elds ). we also show that the string theory must be of
type iib.

the second limit we present is   0. here we give an  expansion to
rst order and discover that the leading term is topological, i.e. independent
of the metric. for the case when the dilaton and the 0-form are constant it
is proportional to the chern class of the u(1)-eld.

we suggest that both these limits might serve as suitable starting points
for investigating d-branes order by order in a parameter expansion. to do
so one needs to specify the background, however, and we leave this as a topic
for future studies.

2 background

the long wavelength limit of d-brane dynamics is described by the born-
infeld action

sbi(tp) = tp z dp+1eq det(ij + fij),

(2.1)

where ij  ix jx g(x) is the metric on the world-sheet induced from
a background metric g and fij is a world-volume two-form,

fij  2[iaj] + bij.

(2.2)

here bij  ix jx b is the pull-back of the background kalb-ramond
eld. the p-brane tension tp is related to the fundamental string tension

(2.3)

with  being the dilaton expectation value and     .
we shall be interested in the case when the background metric g con-
tains a parameter  of dimension length2. as described in [3] this can then
be used to introduce a perturbative scheme in the rescaled string tension4
  
2 . the parameter  may, e.g., be (the square of) the radius of (anti)
desitter space. in general  will be choosen from the parameters in the string
moduli space, and this choice will not be unique.

rescaling the elds according to

i = 

1
2 i,

x  = 

1
2 x ,

a = 

1
2 a,

(2.4)

and including the additional coupling to the various antisymmetric forms
c1...k, the d-brane action in terms of dimensionless elds reads
s = tp (cid:20)z dp+1 eq det(ij + fij) + gs z c  e1 f(cid:21) ,

(2.5)

where

tp

gs(2)

(2.6)

is now the only dimensionful quantity.

the action 2.5 is written in the string frame. the dilaton (coupling
constant) dependence of the brane-action is frame dependent. we choose
to consider the string frame since here the mass of fundamental strings is
o(1) in the string coupling and thus unaected by our strong coupling limit.
other limits have been considered, however [4].

3 a strong coupling limit

in this section we will study a limit of the d-brane action when gs   in
the context of type iib string theory.

4calling  the tension is really a misnomer. it is a dimensionless entity and only related
to the fundamental string tension via a rescaling. we hope that this will not cause any
confusion.

3

in general, to investigate the strong coupling limit of string- or m the-
ory one would like to consider the limit of the action (2.5) for large gs
in conjunction with a transformation of the background [5]. we will ad-
dress the simpler problem of taking the limit gs  , or more precisely

p+1

the restriction to type iib theory is now evident from the following:
in type iia string theory, because of its 11d m-theory origin, the string
coupling gs is related to the radius r11 of the compactied dimension through
s  = r11. hence g

above), and it is inconsistent to let gs   keeping  xed.
(dropping tildes),

using the method employed in [1] and [2], we nd the desired limit to be

s = , (identifying  = r2

s = 1

2 z dp+1 hv iw j(ij + fij)i + 

p+1

2 z c  e1f ,

(3.7)

where v i() and w j() are world volume vector densities. this may be
considered as the zeroth order term in an expansion of the action (2.5) in
powers of g1

. we will study it in its own right, though.

s

the v i and w j-eld equations derived from (3.7) read

w j(ij + fij) = 0
v i(ij + fij) = 0,

and the integrability condition for these equations is

det(ij + fij)  det(ij + bij + 1fij) = 0.

(3.8)

(3.9)

to gain a rst qualitative understanding of this relation, we set b = 0.

in this case it is equivalent to

det(i

j + 1f i

j) = 0.

(3.10)

in analogy to the usual treatment of the born-infeld action one might be
tempted to employ a weak gradient expansion [6] and expand (3.10) in a
power series in |a| << 1. however, as is easily seen, this implies that
2  trf 2 << 1, which is not true in general. e.g., when the background
is minkowski space we have to take    and hence   1. we thus learn
that the weak gradient expansion is not in general viable.

3.1 solving the vw-equations

although the equation (3.9) says that the combined matrix  + f is degen-
erate, this is not so for the induced metric  itself. we may thus introduce
a vielbein ei

i on the world-volume according to

a and its inverse ea

ea
i eb

jab = ij

a, b = 0, ..., p,

(3.11)

where ab is the p + 1-dimensional minkowski metric. in [1] it was found that
the rst part of the action (3.7) has a two-dimensional lorentz structure.
this may be displayed by a redenition of v i and w i. with e1 being the
determinant of the inverse vielbein, we use the so(p, 1)-tangent space group
to write5

v i = (ei
w i = (ei

1)e1  (ei
1)e1  (ei

0 + ei
0  ei

0 + ei
1),
0  ei
1),

(3.12)

thus breaking the tangent-space group down to so(1, 1) so(p 2). in this
gauge, (3.8) reads
(3.13)

1 = ijej
0,

0 = ijej

fijej

1, fijej

or, equivalently,

(cid:16)f 2(cid:17)i

with the integrability condition

det(cid:18)i

j  (cid:16)f 2(cid:17)i

j(cid:19) = 0.

expanding the two-form f in the bivector basis

f = 1

2fijdi  dj = 1

2fabea  eb,

(3.14)

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.13) is solved by

f = f k + f  = 2e0  e1 + fabea  eb, a, b = 2, ..., p,

(3.17)

or, equivalently,

5we introduce the tilde notation for later convenience.

5

[0a1] = (1  b01), [0aa] = b0a,
[1aa] = b1a, fab = 1[aab] + bab,

(3.18)

where    +   m is the covariant derivative,  being the spin-connection
and m the lorentz-group generator.
the integrability condition (3.15) is of course identically satised by

(3.17).

we thus learn from the v and w equations that the 2-form f splits
into one part which lies in the 2d tangent space spanned by e0 and e1, and
one part which lies entirely in the orthogonal part spanned by the eas. as
seen from (3.18), when b = 0, this implies that the d-brane electric eld is
constant and lies in the e1 direction.

3.2 the a-equations

the a eld equations that follow from (3.7) are

i (cid:16)v [iw j](cid:17) = j j

(3.19)

where j i represents the contribution from the background rr gauge elds
and is given by

j i  (p+1)/2

(p+1)/2

(s  1)!2s1

h il1k1...ls1ks1fl1k1...fls1ks1,

(3.20)

where h l1...lpn is the dual of the pull-back of the eld strength of the c (n)
form.

in [1] and [2] the structure of the theory was shown to be simplied in

the following dieomorphism gauge:

iv i = iw i = 0.

in that gauge (3.19) may be rewritten as

where [., .] denotes the lie-bracket.

[v, w ]i = j i

6

(3.21)

(3.22)

the equations (3.19) are highly non-linear. to proceed further we need
to make some simplifying assumptions, and we rst consider the case when
the background rr gauge elds are zero (c (n) = 0). in that case (3.21) says
that [v ii, w jj] = 0 which means that those directions may be choosen as
coordinate-directions [1]. in view of (3.12) we choose to use the e directions
instead. explicitly, we thus use a dieomorphism gauge where6

a = ne

again setting b = 0 and returning to equation (3.13), we nd

(3.23)

(3.24)

(3.25)

we see that (the mixed components of) the u(1) curvature now splits into one
part in the 2d-plane spanned by 0 and 1, and one part in the complemen-
tary directions spanned by the m s. alternatively, the covariant components
are, (setting e = 1,)

fi0 = ix 1x g , fi1 = ix 0x g ,

(3.26)

with fab arbitrary. this is the f -solution. this gauge also leads the follow-
ing expressions that result from (3.11):

x  x g + x x g  00 + 11 = 00 + 11 = 0
x x g  01 = 01 = 0

(3.27)

i.e., the virasoro constraints, (parametrized by i, i 6= 0, 1), in conformal
gauge.

6we may also use the residual symmetry preserving (3.21) to set e = 1.

7

3.3 the x -equations

the x  eld equations that follow from (3.7) are

i (cid:16)(v (iw j)g + v [iw j]b)jx (cid:17)

 v iw jix jx (g + b),
= i + k,

(3.28)

where i contains the contribution from the rr gauge elds

(3.29)

and k contains the b-eld strength. setting the c ns to zero and using the
gauges (3.12), (3.23), the equation (3.28) becomes [2]

2
0 x   2

 0x 0x    

 1x 1x  = 0,

(3.30)

i.e., the equation of motion of a string in the 01-coordinates in conformal
gauge. since we also have the virasoro constraints (3.27), we see that the
stringy picture is complete.

3.4 comments

the interpretation of the strong coupling limit that arises from the above
considerations when c (n) = 0 is as follows: the world-volume is foliated by
world-sheets of (generally (p, q) charged) strings. these strings are either
closed or innite. the form f is likewise split into one component in the
world-sheet direction and the rest in the complementary directions. when
b = 0 this splitting applies to the u(1) eld-strength itself: the component
in the world-sheet is then determined by the string tension  and those in
the complementary directions are not determined by the eld equations, in
agreement with the role of the a-eld as a lagrange multiplier (in this limit).
to gain some further insight into the string parton picture one may
argue as follows: if instead of the gauge choice (3.23) we only make a partial
choice ei
0, we nd from the a-equations (3.19) that (in the absence of
rr-elds),

0 = i

0em

1 = mem

1 = 0, m  1, ..., p.

(3.31)

8

is independent of 0 and divergence-free in the spatial indices m.
thus em
1
this means that em
1 has no sources and that its eld lines are either closed or
go o to innity. since the relations (3.21) still hold in this gauge, we retain
the string interpretation with the em
1 -direction representing the spatial string
direction. we thus conclude that the strings are either closed or innite.
the strings going o to innity might possibly have an interpretation as
d1-branes (corresponding to branes within branes).

when c (n) 6= 0, the situation will in general be more complicated. the
one exception is when only c (p+1) 6= 0, since this eld does not enter in
(3.22). the above analysis thus goes through, but now there is a c (p+1)-
dependent source on the right-hand side of (3.28). when c (n) 6= 0, n < p + 1,
the equations become very hard to analyze, in general. there are special
cases, however, where an analysis similiar to the one above is possible. we
now discuss one such example.
0 = i

0 and making the further gauge choice 0e0

staying in the gauge ei

1 =

0, we nd from the a-equations (3.19) that

[e0, e1]0 = 0,

[e0, e1]m = j m .

(3.32)

hence only the spatial components of the currernt (3.20) , j m, enter the
commutation relation, not j 0. clearly, in backgrounds where j m = 0 we
may again use the coordinates (3.23) (with e = 1 for simplicity), and the
string interpretation is again viable.

to gain an understanding of the circumstances that might yield such a
result, let us consider the current (3.20) for the special case when only c (p+1)
and c (p1) 6= 0. the rst of these will not aect (3.32), as discussed above.
the statement that j m = 0 is then tantamount to h m = 0. a sucient
condition for this to be true is that

0x 1h1...p = 0.

(3.33)

this last condition has a rather clear physical meaning: since we may now go
to coordintes (3.23) where the string interpretation holds, we can restate it as
p 1h1...p = 0, i.e., the eldstrength h (p) is orthogonal to the momentum-
density p of the parton string. since furthermore our gauge choice 0e0
1 = 0
1 = j 0, the argument below (3.31) extends to say that in
implies that mem
this case the string partons are either innite strings, closed strings or open
strings that end on the d-branes that are sources for c (p+1) and c (p1). the

9

last case requires that these sources intersect with the world-volume of the
d-brane under discussion [7].

4 the   0 limit.
in this section we turn to the   0 limit of the action (2.5). this may be
interpreted as either a small tension or a large curvature limit. the latter
interpretation is of particular interest for the ads/cft correspondence [8],
where the limit away from weak gravitation corresponds to a limit away
from large n in the boundary theory. in any case   0 represents a high-
energy limit where higher derivative terms, i.e., derivatives of the u(1) eld
strength, are expected to become important. since we are studying a low
energy eective action this limit thus seems irrelevant at rst sight. here
we take the attitude, however, that there may be features of the high energy
theory that are of topologic and algebraic nature and may be captured in
such a limit. alternatively, since we do not prove this, one may also study
the limit of the model considered in its own right (i.e.
independent of its
relation to string theory).

we again consider the typeiib theory, which means that p is restricted
to be odd. we are interested in the rst few terms in an - expansion of the
action. to that end we rewrite the born-infeld part of (2.5) as

s = g1

s z d1  ...  dp+1e hdet  det{(b + f ) 
 }
 }i
det{( + (b + f )1) 

1
2 .

(4.34)

making use of the expansion7

d1  ...  dp+1qdet{(b + f )} =

1
l!

(b + f )  ...  (b + f ),

(4.35)

where 2l = p + 1, we expand the full action (2.5) as follows

7this corresponds to the expansion of the determinant of a 2l  2l skew matrix as the

square of the pfaan.

10

s =

g1
l! z n(e + gsc (0))f  ...  f
s
+l((e + gsc (0))b + gsc (2))f  ...  f + o(3)o .

(4.36)

we see that the leading term corresponds to a coupling to a d-instanton.
with q(x)  e + gsc (0) it has the form

z qf  ...  f ,

(4.37)

which displays its topological character: when q = const it is proportional
to the chern class of the u(1) eld, and it is always independent of a metric.
the subleading is a (generalized) chern-simons type term. further we
note that the form of the action (4.36) preserves sl(2, z)-invariance. in fact,
had we only considered the born-infeld action in this limit and then imposed
sl(2, z)-invariance, we would have discovered the c (0) and c (2) couplings.

5 discussion

p+1

we have studied two limits the born-infeld action for d-branes in a given
xed background. as a basis for this we used an action with rescaled
elds and tension (). the strong coupling limit we took to be dened by

2 /gs << 1 with  xed and the high energy limit we studied was   0.
in the rst limit we were able to solve the v i, w i, ai and x  equations
for c (n) = 0, n = 0, ..., p and recover the picture of the world volume as
foliated by strings from [1]. restrictions on the geometry led to the possi-
ble constituent strings going o to innity (d1-branes) or being closed.the
general case proved to be considerably more complicated due to the pres-
ence of the current built from the c (n)s, although we saw that the string
parton picture survived in a particular example. in that example we found
the additional option of the constituent strings being open but ending on the
d-brane sources of the c (n) background elds.

in the second limit, we found an -expansion whose leading term is topo-
logical. we also noted that sl(2, z)-invariance predicts the form of the c (0)

11

and c (2) couplings in the next to leading term. we also noted that inter-
preting this limit as taking the radius r  0 in the ads picture, this limit
should probe physics away from the large n limit.
to proceed further with both these expansions one would need to specify
in fact, solving the ai and x  equations in the second
the background.
limit order by order in  requires knowledge of the -dependence of the
background. this is a possible direction for future research. it would also be
interesing to compare our results to other ways of extracting string dynamics
from born infeld theory, e.g. the born-infeld strings of [9]
