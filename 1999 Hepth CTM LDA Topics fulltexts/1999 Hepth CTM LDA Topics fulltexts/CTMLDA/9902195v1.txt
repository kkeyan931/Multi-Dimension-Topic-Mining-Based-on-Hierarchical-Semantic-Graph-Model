we study the thermodynamic stability of charged black holes in gauged
supergravity theories in d = 5, d = 4 and d = 7. we nd explicitly the
location of the hawking-page phase transition between charged black holes
and the pure anti-de sitter space-time, both in the grand-canonical ensemble,
where electric potentials are held xed, and in the canonical ensemble, where
total charges are held xed. we also nd the explicit local thermodynamic
stability constraints for black holes with one non-zero charge. in the grand-
canonical ensemble, there is in general a region of phase space where neither
the anti-de sitter space-time is dynamically preferred, nor are the charged
black holes thermodynamically stable. but in the canonical ensemble, anti-de
sitter space-time is always dynamically preferred in the domain where black
holes are unstable.

we demonstrate the equivalence of large r-charged black holes in d = 5,
d = 4 and d = 7 with spinning near-extreme d3-, m2- and m5-branes,
respectively. the mass, the charges and the entropy of such black holes can
be mapped into the energy above extremality, the angular momenta and the
entropy of the corresponding branes. we also note a peculiar numerological
sense in which the grand-canonical stability constraints for large charge black
holes in d = 4 and d = 7 are dual, and in which the d = 5 constraints are
self-dual.

i. introduction

since the work of [1] on the thermodynamics of near-extreme d3-branes, there has been
considerable interest in the extent to which supergravity solutions reect the thermal prop-
erties of non-abelian gauge theory in 3 + 1 dimensions with n = 4 supersymmetry. the
conformal invariance of the underlying theory suggests that the only part of the supergrav-
ity solution that is relevant is the near-horizon region, which amounts to a black hole in
ve-dimensional anti-de sitter space (ads5) times a ve-sphere (s5). indeed, following the
conjecture [2] that string theory on ads5  s5 is physically identical to n = 4 gauge theory
on the boundary of ads5, it was shown [3,4] that the thermodynamics of large schwarzschild
black holes in ads5 matches the expected thermodynamics of the gauge theory, at least up
to constants. in part this amounts to a rephrasing of [1]; but also [3] went on to propose
a description of pure qcd3 in terms of the nite-temperature theory on a near-extreme
d3-brane. a key ingredient to the connement-deconnement transition described in [3]
was that the gauge theory is on a three-sphere of nite volume. the nite volume breaks
the conformal invariance which would otherwise make a phase transition impossible.

in [5], the study of near-extreme d3-brane thermodynamics was extended to include
the case where the branes have angular momentum in a plane orthogonal to the branes.
we call this type of angular momentum spin. like most charged black hole solutions, the
d3-brane with no spin exhibits positive specic heat suciently close to extremality. this
property has long been regarded as the sine qua non for comparison with eld theory, since
eld theories are always expected to have positive susceptibilities. the surprise in [5] was
that even in the near-horizon limit where eld theory is supposed to be applicable, the
thermodynamics is not always stable. if the spin is too large compared to the energy, the
near-extreme brane solution no longer represents even a local maximum of the entropy;
the entropy fails to remain a subadditive function of external variables such a energy and
angular momentum. the stability analysis has been generalized to the m2- and m5-branes,
and to multiple angular momenta [6]. for d3-, m2- and m5-branes, cai and soh [7] have
discussed the critical behavior of specic heats and other susceptibilities near the boundary
of stability, and also at other points in phase space related to stability with xed angular
momenta.

subadditivity of the entropy is a generalization of the requirement of positive specic
heat. it amounts to the eective euclidean action for the black hole conguration being a
local minimum. thus the stability criterion used in [5] is rather dierent from [3], where the
location of the connement-deconnement transition was found by comparing the euclidean
action of two topologically distinct geometries which made competing contributions to the
path integral. one geometry represented a black hole, while the other represented a gas
of particles in anti-de sitter space. the discontinuous transition between the two was rst
studied by hawking and page [8].

one of the goals of the present paper is to compare the hawking-page transition to the
subadditivity condition on the entropy, for charged black holes in anti-de sitter space, i.e.,
charged black hole congurations in maximally supersymmetric gauged supergravity [911].
in a realization of the gauged supergravity theories as a truncation of string theory or
m theory compactied on a sphere, the gauge group is the isometry group of the sphere.
in the ads/cft correspondence this gauge group becomes the r-symmetry group of the

2

boundary cft which is thought to be dual to string theory on the anti-de sitter geometry.
(recall, the r-symmetry algebra is by denition that part of the supersymmetry algebra
which commutes with the poincare symmetries but not the supersymmetries. it is like a
bosonic avor symmetry, but evades the coleman-mandula theorem by nevertheless partic-
ipating in the same superalgebra as the lorentz group generators). we therefore refer to
this type of charge as r-charge. our work extends that of [5] in several ways. first, we
show that the kaluza-klein reduction of near-extreme spinning branes in fact corresponds
to large r-charged black holes in d = 5, 4 and 7. their mass and charges correspond to
the energy above extremality and the angular-momenta of the near-extreme spinning d3-,
m2- and m5-branes. for general r-charged black holes we nd explicitly the constraints
for the hawking-page phase transition as well as subadditivity conditions in the case of a
single r-charge turned on. we do the analysis with the temperature and the r-charges
xed, and also with the temperature and the electric potentials xed. the electric poten-
tials are the thermodynamic dual variables to the r-charges. we refer to the rst type of
analysis as stability in the canonical ensemble, and to the second type as stability in the
grand-canonical ensemble. a subtlety regarding the dierences between ensembles and the
relevance of thermodynamic variables versus xed parameters is explained in section iii a.
the general conclusion from local stability analyses is that branes which spin too fast,
or equivalently black holes with excessive r-charges, are unstable. this begs the question,
what do such congurations break into? if the conserved r-charges are regarded as xed
parameters (canonical ensemble), then in view of our results it seems plausible that exces-
sively r-charged black holes in anti-de sitter space undergo a hawking-page transition to
a gas of particles. our analysis shows that this is indeed the case. the transition is an
essentially quantum phenomenon which eliminates an event horizon and a singularity from
the space-time. on the other hand, if instead of the total r-charges their dual potentials are
specied at the boundary of anti-de sitter space (grand-canonical ensemble), we nd that
the hawking-page transition cannot altogether explain the instability of excessively charged
solutions. we show that for the grand-canonical ensemble there is always a domain of large
r-charges for which the black hole is dynamically preferred in the sense of hawking and
page, but is locally thermodynamically unstable. that is, the black holes euclidean action
is smaller than that of the gas of particles in anti-de sitter space, but nevertheless is only a
saddle point and not a local minimum of the action.

in section ii we exhibit the r-charged black hole solutions in ads5, found in [10], which
will be the focus of the paper. in section iii we describe the conditions for local thermo-
dynamic stability and for the hawking-page-type transition. in section iv we demonstrate
explicitly that spinning near-extreme d3-branes can be kaluza-klein reduced to large r-
charged black holes in ads5, and show (subsection iv b) how the thermodynamics of spin-
ning d3-branes can be recovered from our results in section iii. in sections v and vi we
extend our results to charged black holes in ads4 [11] and ads7, respectively. in section vii
we relate these black holes to spinning m2-branes and m5-branes.

ii. black holes in five dimensional gauged supergravity

in this section we summarize the black hole solution in d = 5 n = 8 gauged supergravity.
this solution was found in [10] as a special case (stu-model) of the solutions of d = 5 n = 2
gauged supergravity equations of motion. the relevant bosonic part of the lagrangian can
be cast in the following form [10]:

above, we have chosen the newtons constant g5 =

4 .1 here the following parameterization

qi =  sinh2 i

,

qi =  sinh i cosh i .

(6)

in the following we shall concentrate on the black hole solutions with k = 1. the solution

is specied by the adm mass:

1this choice allows for the most ecient parameterization of the the physical charges qi =
d2(d3)
qi = qi (d = 5). our normalization of the gauge elds diers from that introduced in
[10] by a factor of 2

where the second equality follows from the denition of r+, the radial coordinate at the
outer horizon, as the largest non-negative zero of the function f (r) appearing in (4).

when all the three charges are turned it is not possible to obtain the explicit form of
the entropy s and the inverse temperature  in terms of physical charges qi and the adm
mass m. however, it turns out that the entropy s and the inverse hawking temperature
 can be expressed explicitly in terms of the charges qi and the radial coordinate of the
outer horizon r+:

again, note that qi rather than qi are the physical charges (i.e., the conserved charges to
which gausss law applies). one can express

.

(10)

(11)

the parameterization (8), (9), (10), (11) will turn out to be useful when deriving the the
thermodynamics stability constraints and constraints for the hawking-page phase transition
for these congurations.

in the case of a single non-zero charge, say, q1 = q 6= 0, the horizon coordinate r+ and q
can be expressed explicitly in terms of the adm mass m and physical charge q, and thus all
the corresponding thermodynamic quantities s,  and  can be written explicitly in terms
of m and q. the following relationships are useful in this case:

before we proceed, a comment on the choice of units is in order. it is not completely
general to choose units where simultaneously g5 = 
l = 1. (l is related to the
asymptotic cosmological constant  =  6
l2 .) the reason is that g5 is a length cubed and
g is an inverse length, so g5g3 is a pure number. if n is the number of units of dirac ux
supporting the ads5  s5 geometry, then one nds g5g3 = 
4 and
g = 1 simultaneously actually xes n = 2.
nevertheless, in the following sections we shall take g5 = 

2n 2 . so picking g5 =

iii. phases of r-charged black holes

a. ensembles and the nature of stability

we will explore two notions of thermodynamic stability:

local and global. roughly
speaking, the distinction is local versus global minima of an appropriate thermodynamic
potential. there are various subtleties to explain, and we will address them in this section.
local thermodynamic stability is the statement that the entropy s as a function of the
other extensive thermodynamic variables xi is subadditive in a suciently small neighbor-
hood of a given point in the phase space of possible xi. in our case the variables xi are m
and the conserved charges qi. when s is a smooth function of the xi, subadditivity is equiv-
alent to the hessian matrix [ 2s
] being negative denite. again provided s is smooth,
xixj
the region of local stability is bounded by a locus of simple zeroes of the determinant of the
hessian (or possibly zeroes of higher odd orderbut this is a non-generic situation that we
will never encounter).

on can also characterize the region s of phase space in which local thermodynamic
stability holds in terms of legendre transforms. s is the largest possible region satisfying
two criteria. first, it contains a particular reference point which we know is stable:
for
instance, a point where m is very large and all qi = 0. second, in legendre transforming
the thermodynamic potential with respect to some or all of the xi, the map from xi to the
thermodynamic conjugate variables xi must be one-to-one, so that the legendre transform
with respect to the chosen xi composed with the legendre transform with respect to the
conjugate xi gives the identity (i.e., the legendre transforms are invertible). the region s
can be parametrized in terms of xi or xi. thus we see that thermodynamic stability does
not depend on the choice of ensemble; rather, it is a criterion for being able to legendre
transform freely among ensembles. from a mathematical point of view, dierent ensembles
are dierent methods of calculating the same thing.

there is one big caveat to the foregoing remarks: we have to decide which quantities
are thermodynamic variables which could in principle be allowed to vary in an experiment,
and which are xed parameters of the system which cannot vary. striking out entries in the
list of thermodynamic variables xi actually decreases the dimension of the phase space. for
example, if we regarded all the charges qi as xed parameters, then the phase space would
be parametrized just by the mass m. however, in practice it is convenient to speak loosely

6

of phase space as the space of possible values for all the xi, regardless of which of them
we regard as thermodynamic variables. the more xi we regard as xed parameters, the
larger the region of stability. the reason is that we are decreasing the family of legendre
transforms that have to be invertible. fewer conditions means a larger region on which they
are all satised.

as a form of rhetorical shorthand, we shall indicate which of the xi we regard as thermo-
dynamic variables by specifying a particular ensemble. for instance, the canonical ensemble
is the one obtained from the microcanonical ensemble by trading entropy, or equivalently
mass, for temperature via a legendre transform. thus any reference to the canonical ensem-
ble really means that we are thinking of the mass as the only thermodynamic variable in the
microcanonical ensemble, and that the charges qi are xed parameters. the grand-canonical
ensemble is obtained from the microcanonical ensemble by legendre transforming with re-
spect to entropy and all the charges, so we are now thinking of the charges as thermodynamic
variables, too.

the local stability computation in any ensemblewhere by speaking of one ensemble or
another we are distinguishing thermodynamic variables from xed parameters, as explained
in the previous paragraphcan in principle be carried out by nding zeroes of the determi-
nant of a submatrix of [ 2s
]. the appropriate submatrix is the one which includes only
xixj
those rows and columns pertaining to the xi which are thermodynamic variables. for the
canonical ensemble, this determinant is essentially the specic heat at constant qi. for the
grand-canonical ensemble, it is a combination of this specic heat with other susceptibili-
ties. direct computation of these quantities tend to be extremely burdensome. we nd it
more ecient to work with the thermodynamic potential of the specied ensemble, but as a
function of the extensive thermodynamic variables rather than the thermodynamic variables
which are usually regarded as the independent variables for that ensemble. the method is
best illustrated by an example. suppose we are working in the canonical ensemble, so the qi
will always be regarded as xed (and from here on notationally suppressed). consider the
helmholtz (euclidean) action:

ih = f = m  s .

(13)

suppose we write m explicitly in terms of s: this amounts to a complete specication of
the thermodynamics in the microcanonical ensemble. thus we write ih as a function of s
and the free parameter , which will be determined by the legendre transform condition:

  ih
s !

= 

m
s  1 = 0 .

if we take a second derivative,

  2ih
s2 !

= 

2m
s2 = 

2s/m 2
(s/m)2 ,

(14)

(15)

= 0 is equivalent

s 2 (cid:17)
(where we have used (14) in the second equality), then we see that (cid:16) 2ih

m 2 = 0, which is the relevant local thermodynamic stability equation. in fact, (15) is

to 2s

7

still rather tedious to compute, but a change of variables makes life much easier: we nd we
can write s wholly in terms of r+, which is the location of the outer horizon (see equation
(8)). it does not matter that the qi enter into the relation between s and r+, since they are
just xed parameters. next we note that the condition

  2ih
+ !

r2

=   s

r+!2  2ih
s2 !

+

2s
r2

s !
+   ih

= 0

(16)

in the presence of the constraint (14) is equivalent to the vanishing of (15), provided s/r+
is non-singular. equation (16) represents the essence of the method we use to evaluate local
thermodynamic stability. working in the grand-canonical ensemble, there are more thermo-
dynamic variables (qi as well as the mass or the entropy), and the convenient reparametriza-
tion is in terms of r+ and qi. working through the steps (14), (15), and (16), it is straightfor-
ward to show that the zeroes of the determinant of the hessian of s with respect to m and
the qi coincide with the zeroes of the determinant of the hessian of the gibbs (euclidean)
action ig, written in the form

ig = (m 

3

xi=1

qii)  s ,

(17)

with respect to r+ and qi. where r+
canonical analysis by the jacobian j = det (s,qi)
jacobian is non-singular. this completes our discussion of local thermodynamic stability.

s appears in (16), it will be replaced in the grand-
(r+,qi). it is straightforward to check that this

the euclidean version of an r-charged black hole in ads5 is characterized by some
boundary data: the period for euclidean time, and the potential, which in ten-dimensional
language amounts to the angular velocity with which the s5 is rotating. there is another ge-
ometry with the same boundary data: perfect, weyl-at, euclidean ads5 times an s5 which
again is rotating with the angular velocity specied by the potential. in ve-dimensional
terms, this geometry is interpreted as a gas of r-charged particles in anti-de sitter space.
following hawking and page [8], we can ask whether this geometry or the black hole geome-
try is favored. the geometry with smaller action will dominate the euclidean path integral.
the nature of the boundary data determine how the action must be computed. if it is indeed
the potential and the temperature which are specied at the boundary, then the relevant
action is the gibbs action, (18).
if instead the total r-charge is xed, it is appropriate
to compute the helmholtz action, (13). we will discuss the computation of these actions
in more detail in the next two subsections. in both cases our strategy will be to subtract
o the pure ads5 action from the black hole action to obtain a nite quantity, ig or ih.
the vanishing of these actions will indicate the hawking-page phase transition. past this
transition point the black hole cannot be the global minimum of the euclidean action. if
the pure anti-de sitter geometry is the only geometry which competes with the black hole in
the path integral, and if the black hole is locally stable, then the hawking-page transition
represents the edge of the region where the black hole is globally stable.

to summarize, in judging local stability the choice of ensemble amounts to a decision
regarding which quantities in the system are thermodynamic variables which are allowed to
vary within the system, and with respect to which legendre transforms should be invertible;

8

whereas in locating the hawking-page transition, the choice of ensemble is motivated by the
more standard notion of whether a given thermodynamic quantity or its conjugate (in the
sense of legendre transforms) is controlled from outside.

it is a matter of physical motivation which ensemble one decides to use.2 for instance,
in the study of spinning branes [6] where the world-volume is innite, any given part of
the brane can be regarded as a system in the presence of a heat bath which is the rest
of the brane. the boundary between the system and the heat bath is ctitious, and both
energy and charge can ow across it. this suggests that for the purpose of judging local
stability, one had better use the grand canonical ensemble. using the canonical ensemble,
where legendre transforms with respect to the charge density are disallowed, one is ignoring
the possibility that the charge density might become inhomogeneous.

holography also seems to favor the the grand-canonical ensemble, since the temperature
and electric potentials (which are xed in the grand-canonical ensemble) can be specied in
terms of the asymptotic geometry. specically, the inverse temperature is the circumference
of the euclidean times s1, and the electric potentials divided by the temperature are the
twist one makes before identifying around this circle. the standard ads/cft approach
would be to sum over all geometries with the given asymptotic circumference and twist.
assuming that only the black hole geometry and the pure anti-de sitter geometry are com-
peting in the sum, one judges which is preferred according to which has a lower gibbs free
energy. from this point of view the grand-canonical ensemble is the relevant one, and we
study it in subsection iii b by computing the gibbs euclidean action. partly to illustrate
some interesting dierences between the ensembles, we calculate the helmholtz euclidean
action in subsection iii c and discuss the stability constraints that follow from it.

b. grand-canonical ensemble

t  i (i = 1, 2, 3).

in this subsection we spell out the properties of the euclidean eective action for the
grand-canonical ensemble of r-charged black holes discussed in section ii. a state in the
grand-canonical ensemble is usually specied by the inverse temperature  and the electric
potentials ai

the gibbs euclidean action can be obtained following the procedure, initiated by hawk-
ing and page [8] for the schwarzschild black hole in ads4, further developed by york et
al. [12], and applied to d = 4 anti-de sitter reissner nordstrom black holes in [13] (see also
[14]). when employing this procedure the boundary conditions (including the local temper-
ature) are dened at a nite value of the radial coordinate rb; these boundary conditions
in turn uniquely determine the reduced euclidean action which has both bulk and surface
term contributions. one also subtracts from it the pure ads5 space-time contribution. as
the last step the limit rb   is taken, i.e., the articial boundary is removed. for further

2in the context of spinning branes the distinction between the canonical and grand-canonical
ensembles and the correspondingly dierent local stability constraints were addressed by cai and
soh [7].

9

details see, e.g., [12,14,13].3

the above procedure will assign zero action to the pure ads5 geometry. with no sub-
tractions and no cuto, the action integral formally diverges, so some choice of zero point is
necessary. the ads5 geometry also involves a constant electric potential. constant electric
potential yields zero eld strength and hence makes no contribution to the action, and the
the anti-de sitter geometry is undistorted. in the ten-dimensional geometry, the constant
electric potential is interpreted as a twist on the s5 part of the geometry. to understand
this, note that the gauge elds arise from mixed components of the ten-dimensional metric,
g, where  is an ads5 index and  is an s5 index. for instance, if we turn on a single con-
stant electric potential, corresponding to rotations in the  direction of an s5 parametrized
so that the metric is ds2 = d2 + sin2 d2 + cos2 d2
3, then what we are doing from a
ten-dimensional perspective is making gt non-zero. this o-diagonal entry in the metric
can be exactly killed if one changes the angular variable from  to  =   t.  has the
interpretation of an angular velocity at which the s5 rotates. now,  is single valued in the
periodized euclidean geometry, whereas  jumps by /th at the identication point. this
is what we mean by twist on the s5. if one applies kaluza-klein reduction to get back to
ve-dimensions, then in the normalization conventions used in section iv b, we have the

electric potential a

t = .

the gibbs euclidean action takes the following form:

ig = (m 

3

xi=1

qii)  s

(18)

where m is the adm mass, qi is the physical charge and s is the entropy. s = a
4g5
a is the area at the outer horizon.

where

the structure of this action is expected from thermodynamic considerations as well. the
physical, lorentzian, black hole solutions are extrema of (18). the expressions (9) and (11)
for the inverse hawking temperature  and the electric potentials i at the outer horizon
can be obtained by extremizing (18) with respect to s and qi with i and  held xed. as
discussed at the beginning of this section, these extrema can also be obtained by nding
zeroes of the rst derivatives of (18) with respect to qi and r+, again keeping  and i xed,
provided the jacobian j = det (s,qi)
explicitly in terms of qi and r+, and it takes the following suggestive form:

for the r-charged black holes of section ii the gibbs action (18) can be expressed

(r+,qi) is non-singular.

3in ref. [3,15] an alternative approach in the study of the of ads-schwarzschild black holes,
suitable for the study of the higher loop () corrections to the eective action, was developed.
there one considers only a bulk term, but again there is a cuto at large radius both for the pure
ads geometry side and for the ads-schwarzschild black hole side. the pure ads geometry is
periodized with a temperature in such a way that at the cut-o radius the circumference of the
compactied s1 is the same as for ads-schwarzschild black hole. then by subtracting the pure
ads bulk integral from the ads-schwarzschild black hole bulk integral, one obtains a nite result
corresponding to the ads-schwarzschild euclidean action.

where  is determined by (9). (we have set l = 1, but powers of l can be restored using
the replacements described at the end of section ii).

now let us specialize to only one non-zero charge: say q1 = q 6= 0 but q2 = q3 = 0.
the local thermodynamic stability is most eciently analyzed by computing the hessian of
(18) with respect to r+ and q with  and  held xed, in analogy with (16). the stability
constraint is

2r4

+(q + 1)  (q  1)2  0 .

(20)

in the phase space parametrized by (m, q), or more conveniently by (r+, q), the zeroes of
the left hand side of (20) determine the critical lines which form the boundary of stability.
there are two branches:

(21)

q(r+) = 1 + 1

2r2

+ + 9r4

the regions for which q(r+)  q  q+(r+) correspond to locally stable regions, i.e., i bh
g is
a local minimum. when q = 0 the critical point is at r+ = 12 [q = 0, m = 9
8] [10]. the
critical lines merge at q+ = q = 1 and r+ = 0 [m = q = 1]. this point is a bps solution
with zero entropy and nite  = . black holes in the regions q < q(r+) and q > q+(r+)
are thermodynamically unstable. the region q < q(r+) charged black holes which are
much smaller than the size of anti-de sitter space: r+  1, q  1. the curvature of ads
is negligible in the vicinity of these black holes, so we are predicting that singly charged
black holes should be unstable even in at space. and they are: they can be obtained in a
t 5 compactication of type iib string theory as ns5-branes or d5-branes wrapped around
the t 5. the thermodynamic instability of ns5-branes is familiar: the temperature in the
limit of extremality is the hagedorn temperature of the fractionated instanton strings on
the world-volume [16], and as non-extremality increases the temperature goes down.

the location of the hawking-page phase transition between the black hole solution and

the pure ads5 solution is determined by the constraint i bh

g = 0:

q0(r+) = 1  r2
+ ,

(22)

where we have used (19). for q > q0(r+) the black hole solution has i bh
g < 0 and thus it is
the dynamically preferred solution. q0(r+) = 0 corresponds to r+ = 1 [q = 0, m = 3]. this
is the hawking-page phase transition for the d = 5 ads-schwarzschild black hole solution.
for q > q+(r+) > q0(r+), black holes are favored over the pure anti-de sitter space-time,
in this case our evaluation is that we have failed to nd
but they are locally unstable.
the entropically preferred state of the system. one possibility that suggests itself is that a
multi-black hole solution might be favored, but it seems dicult to imagine a static solution
describing multiple black holes in ads5.

for q(r+) < q < q0(r+), pure anti-de sitter space is entropically favored over the black
hole solution, but the black hole solution still corresponds to a local minimum of the gibbs
action. in the uncharged case, this is the region between r+ = 12 [m = 9
8 ] and r+ = 1

fig. 1. in figure 1a stability domains are plotted as q vs. r+ for the grand-canonical ensemble
of d = 5 r-charged black holes with one charge turned on. in figure 1b the same stability plots are
exhibited, but now as q (the physical charge) vs. m (the adm mass). only the region satisfying
the bps bound, m  q, corresponds to physical black hole solutions. the vertically shaded areas
correspond to the regions where the ads5 is the preferred solution and the horizontally shaded area
correspond to the regions where the black hole solutions are local minimum of the gibbs action.
the checkered area is the domain of common overlap: there black holes still correspond to the
local maxima of the entropy (local minima of the euclidean action); however, anti-de sitter space
is preferred globally. in the unshaded area, neither the black hole solution nor pure anti-de sitter
space are global minima of the action.

[m = 3]. these black holes could be termed meta-stable in the sense that they can exist
in equilibrium with a heat bath of particles in anti-de sitter space and are stable under small
perturbations, but the system as a whole could gain entropy by converting the entire black
hole into a gas of r-charged particles.

page 1

page 1

in figure 1a we show all these stability domains in a plot of q vs. r+. to help the
readers intuition we also exhibit the same stability plots in figure 1b, but now as q vs. m.
(on this graph only the region m  q is consistent with the bps bound.) the vertically
shaded areas correspond to the regions where the ads5 is the preferred solution, and the
horizontally shaded area correspond to the regions where the black hole solutions are local
minimum of the gibbs action.

c. canonical ensemble

we now repeat the stability analysis for the canonical ensemble; along with the xed

inverse temperature  , one now xes the physical charges qi, i.e., the eld strengths f i
,

12

(and not the electric potentials i) are xed. following a procedure analogous to the one
spelled out for the grand-canonical ensemble in subsection iii b, but now with the new
boundary conditions, one obtains the following form of the helmholtz euclidean action:

ih = m  s ,

(23)

where m and s are the mass and the entropy of the system and  is the inverse temperature.
extremizing the above action with respect to s, or equivalently, with respect to r+ (while
keeping the physical charges qi xed) determines the correct inverse temperature  of the
black hole solution (9).

to locate the hawking-page transition, we write the helmholtz action (23) for the black

hole solution described in section ii as a function of qi and r+:

i bh
h =


2r2

+ 
+(1  r2
r4

+) + r2
+

qi(2 + r2

+) + 3r2
+

3

xi=1

qiqj + 5

3

xi<j

3

yi=1

qi
 ,

(24)

where  is dened in (9). the phase transition between the black hole solution and the pure
ads5 solution is determined by the zero of i bh

h (24):

q0(r+) =

+  1)

+(r2
r2
2 + r2
+

.

(25)

in the domain q > q0(r+) the black hole solution has ih < 0 and thus it is the dynamically
preferred solution. (for q0 = 0 the critical point is again r+ = 1 [q = 0, m = 3].)

to evaluate local thermodynamic stability, we use the method outlined in subsec-
tion iii a around equation (16). in the case of a single non-zero charge, say q1 = q 6= 0, the
local stability constraint leads to:

2r4

+ + r2

+(5q + 1)  q2 + 6q  1  0 .

(26)

m 2(cid:17)q
this case is simple enough that one can easily verify (26) by explicitly computing (cid:16) 2s

the zeroes of the left hand side of (26) form two critical lines:

.

+ + 33r4

+ ,

+  1
2r2

q(r+) = 1 + 5

2q32 + 64r2
and the stable region corresponds to the domain q(r+)  q  q+(r+). again, q = 0
corresponds to the critical point: r+  12 [q = 0, m = 9
8] [10]. on the other hand now the
stable domain with r+ = 0 corresponds to the range of charges: 3  22  q  3 + 22.
[equivalently, this is the region with m = q (bps-limit) and 3  22 < q = q < 3 + 22.]
black holes in the region q < q(r+) and q > q+(r+) are not thermodynamically stable.

in figure 2a we show the stability regions in a plot of q vs. r+. in figure 2b we exhibit
the same stability regions plotting q vs. m. the vertically shaded areas correspond to the
regions where the ads5 is the preferred solution and the horizontally to the regions where
the black hole solution is the local minimum of the helmholtz action.

(27)

note three salient dierences between the results for the canonical and grand-canonical
ensembles. first, as expected from the general considerations of subsection iii a, the region

fig. 2. in figure 2a we plot the stability domains as q vs. r+ for the canonical ensemble of
d = 5 r-charged black holes with one non-zero charge. in figure 2b the same stability plots are
exhibited, but now plotting q vs. m . the vertically shaded areas are the regions where anti-de
sitter space is the preferred solution. the horizontally shaded areas are the regions where the
black hole solution is a local minimum of the helmholtz action. the checkered area is the domain
of common overlap: meta-stable black holes in the intepretation of section iii b.

of local stability for the canonical ensemble is larger than for the grand-canonical ensemble.
second, the region favored by the pure ads5 is signicantly increased for the canonical
ensemble, and it encompasses the whole region with r+ < 1 and non-zero qis. third, and
most interesting, the pure ads5 space-time is dynamically favored in the whole domain of
the black hole parameters for which the black holes are locally unstable.

iv. spinning d3-branes as r-charged black holes

in this section we establish the precise connection between the near-extreme spinning
d3-branes solution and the solutions of n = 8, d = 5 gauged supergravity found in [10]
and discussed in section ii. in this section we restore all factors of l explicitly, but still set
g5 = 
4 .

a. equivalence of k = 0 r-charged black holes and near-extreme spinning d3-branes

angular momenta in planes perpendicular to the world-volume of d3-branes (which we
refer to as spins to distinguish them from angular momenta in other planes) are realized
in the world-volume theory as charges under the global so(6) r-symmetry group. in the
reduction of type iib supergravity on s5, the so(6) isometry becomes the non-abelian gauge
symmetry of the resulting n = 8 gauged supergravity in ve dimensions, and the spins
become so(6) gauge charges.
in the ads/cft correspondence, the so(6) supergravity
gauge elds in the bulk of ads5 couple to the gauge theory r-currents on the boundary.

14

it is well-known that the near-horizon geometry of near-extreme d3-branes without spin
reduces to a schwarzschild black hole in ads5. the purpose of this section is to show how
spin on the d3-branes reduces to charge on the black holes. by explicitly performing the
kaluza-klein reduction on s5, we will obtain the precise relationship between the parameters
of the r-charged black holes and those of the spinning d3-branes. for the sake of simplicity
only one angular momentum, so that the black hole will have q1 = q 6= 0 but q2 = q3 = 0.
one can verify that the computation extends to the case of all three angular momenta
non-zero.

the near-horizon form of the ten-dimensional d3-brane solution with a single angular

momentum is [17,18]

volk = e2d volk,

(30)

denes the dilaton eld d (not to be confused with the ten-dimensional dilaton ) in
terms of how the volume form on k compares to its limit at spatial innity. the power of
ed in (29) is chosen to put the metric g in einstein frame. for the solution (28) we have

(32)

finally, the ve-dimensional metric g is just the solution (3) with k = 0,  = r4
q1 = 2, and q2 = q3 = 0. note that although d and ds2

0/l2,
k vary over both m and k, the

15

m and the ve-dimensional gauge potential at

 are independent
ve-dimensional metric ds2
of the internal coordinates. the dependence of d on k indicates that the compactication
is a warped product.
there is a slight subtlety in comparing the gauge elds in (42) of [10] with (32): super-
cially in [10] the eld strength seems to vanish because of an explicit prefactor of k. at
this point it is useful to recall the approach of [3] where the k = 0 solution is recovered by
focusing in on a small, nearly at part of the s3 in the k = 1 solution. this amounts to
taking the limit k  0+. in this limit, q = 2 and  = r4
0/l2 are held xed. from equation
(43) of [10] one obtains sinh2  = k2l2/r4
0. the factor of k in this relation conspires to
cancel the one explicitly shown in (42) of [10], and the end result for the gauge eld a1
pertaining to the charge q1 is

a1

t =

l
2

at

 .

(33)

the factor of l
gauge kinetic term picks up a factor of l from gg1g1.

2 comes from a dierent choice of normalization of a in [10]. for us the

there is some debate over the status of ve-dimensional n = 8 gauged supergravity
as a truncation of the kaluza-klein reduction of type iib supergravity/string theory. in
particular, is it true that solutions of the former can always be promoted to solutions of
the latter? this seems guaranteed for supersymmetric solutions from closure properties of
the supersymmetry algebra, but for non-supersymmetric solutions one is making a non-
trivial statement regarding the equations of motion.4 modulo the small technical issue of
compactifying r3 to s3, non-extreme r-charged black holes provide an example of a non-
supersymmetric solution of gauged supergravity which can indeed be promoted to a solution
in ten dimensions: namely the spinning d3-brane solution. the key point is that the gauge
 and the metric g resulting from the kaluza-klein compactication of the
potential at
spinning d3-brane solution are independent of the s5 coordinates.

b. thermodynamic equivalence of large r-charged black holes and spinning

d3-branes

another way to view the k  0+ limit is that black hole solutions with k = 0 can be
recovered from large black hole solutions with k = 1 by restricting attention to a angular
region of the s3 in the k = 1 region where the curvature can be neglected. this was
explained precisely for schwarzschild black holes in [3], and the same story goes through
with charged black holes. new physics shows up in the k = 1 solutions (for instance, the
connement-deconnement transition) because of the nite-size eects of the s3. when
we take k  0+, we are making the volume of the s3 very large compared to the cube
of the inverse temperature. neglecting all nite size eects should lead us back to the
thermodynamics of spinning d3-branes whose world-volume is at and innite. the purpose

4we thank j. distler for explaining this to us.

16

of this subsection is to show this explicitly and to establish the precise connection between
the respective physical parameters.

large r-charged black holes are the ones with r+  l and qi  l2. in this limit, the
expressions for the adm mass m (7) and the physical charges qi (10) reduce to the following
form:

m  3

2 , q2

i  qi ,

(i = 1, 2, 3) ,

(34)

where  is related to r+ and qis by f (r+) = 0 (see eq.(4)). in the large charge limit this
equation implies:

1

3

+ + qi)  r2
(r2

+  0 .

yi=1

(35)

+ = 0 and drop the term kr4

+. this makes sense

to obtain (35), one can start with f (r+)r4
in view of the equivalence of k  0+ and large k = 1 black holes.
yh  1r+, yi  1 qi , (i = 1, 2, 3) ,

by introducing new variables

where  = (3l2)1/4, one can rewrite (35) in the following form:

3

(y2

h + y2

i )  y2

h = 0 .

yi=1

(36)

(37)

this is precisely the horizon equation for spinning d3-branes displayed in section ii of
ref. [6].

one can introduce the energy density e, entropy density s and the charge density ji in

the following way:

e 
ji 
s 

m
n 2v
qi
n 2v

s

n 2v

,

=

yi
yh

,

= 2e3/4yh ,

where

v = 22l3, n 2 = 2l3,  =

2
272 .

(38)

(39)

the thermodynamic variables introduced in (38), together with the denition of the volume
v and the ux n (39) in terms of l (and g5 if we hadnt set it equal to /4) and also the
relationship between yh and yi (36), provides a precise translation of the thermodynamic
variables of large black holes into those of spinning d3-branes. it may seem strange to assign
a denite volume to the s3 on the boundary of ads5. however, as commented on in [20] and
[21], a choice of radial coordinate is equivalent to choosing a denite metric among those
with a specied conformal structure. our choice of radial coordinate was xed in (3).

17

even in view of the above translation of variables, the equivalence between the local ther-
modynamic stability constraints for spinning branes and r-charged black holes is slightly
non-trivial: equations (34) and (38) dene a non-linear relation between e and ji for the
spinning brane and m and qi for the r-charged black hole. to see that the stability con-
straints must turn out the same, think of this relation as a reparametrization of phase
space, similar to the convenient (r+, qi) parametrization we used in earlier sections. the
argument in section iii a should guarantee that the stability region does not depend on the
reparametrization. in the case of one non-zero charge, the stability constraints for r-charged
black holes for the grand-canonical ensemble (20) and canonical ensemble (26) reduce to the
following respective forms in the r+/l  , q/l2   limit:
grand-canonical

v. phases of r-charged black holes in d = 4

so far we have focused our attention on black holes in ads5 because they are dual to
thermal states of n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory in 3+1 dimensions. our analysis is
extended in this section and the next to black holes in maximally supersymmetric gauged
supergravity in d = 4 and d = 7. in section vii we outline their relationship with spinning
m2- and m5-branes.

black holes in d = 4 n = 8 gauged supergravity have been studied in ref. [11]. their

einstein frame metric is of the following form [11,22]:

ds2 = (

4

yi=1

4

hi)1/2f dt2 + (

yi=1

hi)1/2(cid:18)f1dr2 + r2d2,k(cid:19) ,

where

f = k 


r

+ g2r2

4

yi=1

hi , hi = 1 +

qi
r

, (i = 1,   4) .

(42)

(43)

here we have chosen g4 = 1
4. (again we shall concentrate on black hole solutions with
k = 1.) with this choice of g4, qis and the physical charges qis are dened in (6) and the
adm mass is of the following form:

m = 2 +

4

xi=1

qi = 2(r+ + r3

+g2

hi) +

4

yi=1

qi ,

4

xi=1

(44)

where in the second equality the radial coordinate at the outer horizon r+ is dened as the
largest non-negative zero of f (r) (43).

18

again the parameterization of the thermodynamic quantities in terms of qi and r+ (in-

stead of qi and m) is most suitable:

s =

a
4g4

(r+ + qi) ,

4

= 4vuut
yi=1
4r+qq4

i=1 qi + r2

+ + 2r3

+p4

i=1(r+ + qi)

+(p4

i<j qiqj + 1) q4

i=1 qi

the physical charges are then determined in terms of qi and r+ in the following way:

q2

i = qi(r+ + qi)
1 +

1

r+ yj6=i

(r+ + qj)
 ,

and the electric potentials at the outer horizon take the following form:

(47)

(48)

i = ai

t(r+) =

qi

, (i = 1,   , 4) .

r+ + qi
4 we shall also take l  1

g = 1. (note l is related to
l2 .) however, l can be restored by replacing

in the following, along with g4 = 1

the asymptotic cosmological constant  =  3
r+ by r+

l and qi by qi
l .

a. grand-canonical ensemble and stability constraints

the gibbs euclidean action is of the form:

ig = (m 

4

xi=1

qii)  s ,

(49)

where m is the mass, qi is the physical charge and s = a
is the entropy. the extrema of
4g4
this action correspond to the black hole solutions for which the inverse hawking temperature
and the electric potentials at the outer horizon are given in (46) and (48), respectively.

the critical hypersurfaces of thermodynamic stability can again be determined by evalu-
ating the zeroes of the determinant of the hessian of second derivatives of (49) with respect
to r+ and qi.

the phase transition between the black hole solutions and pure ads4 occurs when (49)
for the black hole solution ceases to be negative. when expressed explicitly in terms of qi
and r+, (49) takes the following suggestive form:

i bh
g =



r+ "r2
+ 

4

(r+ + qi)# ,
yi=1

(50)

where  is determined by (46).

19

for one non-zero charge only, say q1 = q 6= 0, the the region of local thermodynamic

stability is specied by

3r4

+ + qr3

+  2q2r2

+ + 2r2

+ + 3qr+  1  0 .

the zeroes of the above expression correspond to two critical lines:

q(r+) =

3
4r+

+

r+
4 

1

4s 1

r2
+

+ 22 + 25r2

+ ,

(51)

(52)

with the stable domain satisfying q(r+) < q < q+(r+). q = 0 has a critical point at
r+ = 13 [8]. note also that as r+  0 the local stability region is pushed to large q:
q   as r+  0.
the phase transition between the black hole solution and the pure ads4 solution is now
determined by:

q0(r+) =

1
r+  r+ .

(53)

for q > q0(r+) the black holes are dynamically preferred over ads4. as r+  0, the critical
line is pushed to q0  . q0 = 0 has the hawking-page transition at r+ = 1 [8].
for q > q+(r+) > q0(r+) black holes unstable, but at the same time the pure ads4 space-
time is not dynamically preferred either. the region q(r+) < q < q0(r+) corresponds to
the domain where ads4 is entropically favored, but the black hole solution still corresponds
to a local minimum of the gibbs action (49).

in figure 3 we plot all these stability regions for q vs. r+. the vertically shaded area
corresponds to the regions where the ads4 is the preferred solution and the horizontally
shaded area corresponds to the region where the black hole solution is the local minimum
of the gibbs action.

b. canonical ensemble and stability constraints

repeating the same analysis now for the canonical ensemble yields the helmholtz action

(23) which for d = 4 black holes takes the following form:

i bh
h =

+ + r2

+(1 +



r+ 
r4

4

xi<j

qiqj) + r+(

4

xi=1

qi + 2

4

xi<j<k

qiqjqk) + 3

4

yi=1

qi
 ,

where  is dened in (46). i bh

h (54) diers signicantly from i bg

g (50).

in the case of a single non-zero charge the local stability constraint leads to:

3r5

+ + 6qr4

+ + 2r3

+ + 7qr2

+ + 2q2r+  r+  q  0 .

the critical line now has only one branch:

q(r+) =

figure 4

fig. 4. the stability domains are plotted for q vs. r+ for the canonical ensemble of d = 4
r-charged black holes with one non-zero charge. the vertically shaded areas indicates the regions
where ads4 is the preferred solution, and the horizontally shaded area shows the regions where the
black hole solutions are local minima of the helmholtz action. the checkered area is the domain
of common overlap. explicit powers of l can be restored by replacing r+ with r+
l , and q with q
l .

with the region q  q(r+) stable.
takes place along the line

the phase transition between the black hole solution and the pure ads4 solution now

q0(r+) = r3

+  r+ .

(57)

for q > q0(r+) the black hole solution is the dynamically preferred solution. pure ads4
is dynamically favored in the whole domain where the black hole is thermodynamically
unstable.

in figure 4 we plot the stability regions for q vs. r+. the vertically shaded area corre-
sponds to the regions where ads4 is the preferred solution, and the horizontally shaded area
corresponds to the region where the black hole solution is a local minimum of the helmholtz
action.

vi. phases of r-charged black holes in d = 7

we quote the black hole solution of n = 4 gauged supergravity in d = 7 (while the
solution has not been derived from the actual d = 7 lagrangian the structure of this solution
is in close analogy with the structure of the r-charged solution in d = 4 and d = 5.):

ds2 = (h1h2)4/5f dt2 + (h1h2)1/5(cid:18)f1dr2 + r2d5,k(cid:19) ,

where

(58)

(59)


r4 + g2r2h1h2 , hi = 1 +

qi
r4 , (i = 1, 2) .

f = k 
we have chosen g7 = 2
related by (6) and the mass is specied as:

4 . we are most interested in the case k = 1. the qi and qi are again

m = 5

4 + q1 + q2 = 5

4(r4

+ + r6

+g2h1h2) + q1 + q2 ,

(60)

where again in the second equality the radial coordinate at the outer horizon r+ is dened
as the largest non-negative zero of f (r) (59).

the parameterization of the thermodynamic quantities in terms of of qi and r+ yields

the following expressions:

s =

a
4g7

= r+q(r4

+ + q1)(r4

+ + q2) ,

 =

+q(r4

3r8

+ + q1)(r4

+ + q2)

+(q1 + q2)  q1q2

(61)

(62)

.

the physical charges are then determined in terms of qi and r+ in the following way:

22

q2
i = qi(r4

+ + qi)"1 +

1
r2
+

(r4

+ + qj)# , (j 6= i) ,

and the electric potentials at the outer horizon take the following form:

i = ai

t(r+) =

qi

r4
+ + qi

, (i = 1, 2) .

(63)

(64)

in the following we set l  1
constant  =  15

g = 1. l, which is related to the asymptotic cosmological

l2 , can be restored by replacing r+ by r+

l and qi by qi
l4 .

a. grand-canonical ensemble and stability constraints

ig for the black hole solution, when expressed explicitly in terms of qi and r+, takes the

form:

i bh
g =


2r2

+ hr6

+  (r4

+ + q1)(r4

+ + q2)i ,

(65)

where  is determined by (62).

for one non-zero charge only, the thermodynamic stability constraint takes the following

form:

3r8

+ + r6

+ + 2qr4

+  2r4

+ + 3qr2

+  q2  0 .

the critical line has two branches:

q(r+) = r2

+(cid:16)r2

+ + 3

2 + 1

2q16r4

+ + 16r2

+ + 1(cid:17) ,

(66)

(67)

and the region of local stability is q(r+) < q < q+(r+). q = 0 has the critical point at
r+ = q 2

3. note also that as r+  0 the critical line is pushed to q  0.

the phase transition between the black hole solution and the pure ads7 takes place at

q0(r+) = 0, where

q0(r+) = r2

+  r4
+ .

(68)

for q > q0(r+) the black hole is the dynamically preferred solution. as r+  0 the critical
line is pushed to q0  0. when q0 = 0, the hawking-page transition is at r+ = 1.
in
the region q > q+(r+) > q0(r+), the black hole solutions are unstable, but ads7 is not
dynamically preferred either.

in figure 5 the stability regions are shown in a plot of q vs. r+.

fig. 6. the stability domains q vs. r+ for the canonical ensemble of d = 7 r-charged black
holes with one non-zero charge are given. the vertically shaded areas correspond to the regions
where the ads7 is the preferred solution and the horizontally shaded area correspond to the regions
where the black hole solutions are local minimum of the helmholtz action. the checkered area is
the domain of common overlap. the units of l = 1 can be restored by replacing r+ with r+
l , and
q with q

vii. r-charged black holes in d = 5 (d = 7) and spinning m2

(m5)-branes

the kaluza-klein reduction described in section iv of spinning d3-branes to r-charged
black holes in ads5 can be repeated for spinning m2- and m5-branes [23], and it leads to
r-charged black holes in ads4 and ads7. as in subsection iv b, one can also obtain the
precise translation from the mass m, charges qi, and the entropy of large r-charged black
holes in ads4 [ads7], to the energy e above extremality, the angular momenta ji, and the
entropy s of near-extreme spinning m2-branes [m5-branes].

as a consequence of this equivalence, the thermodynamic stability constraints derived
for the general spinning m2-branes [and m5-branes] should coincide with those of large
r-charged black holes in d = 4 [and d = 7], respectively. for the case of only one non-
zero charge the grand-canonical ensemble (51) [(66)] and canonical ensemble (51) [and (66)]
stability constraints reduce in the case of large r-charged black holes (r+  1 and q  1)
to the following stability constraints:

3r+  2q  0 , d= 4, grand-canonical ,
r+ + 2q  0 , d= 4, canonical ,

[ 3r4

+  q  0 , d= 7, grand-canonical ,
+q  q2  0 , d= 7, canonical

]

r8
+ + 4r4

(73)
(74)

(75)
(76)

which agree precisely with the respective stability constraints [7,6] for spinning m2-branes
[and m5-branes] with only one angular momentum turned on.

finally, we would like to note a feature of the asymptotics of the stability conditions for
small and large q which may be only numerological coincidence, but seems to us intriguing.

25

there is an exponent p which characterizes the scaling of the entropy s of near-extreme
non-dilatonic p-branes with the number n of branes: s  n p. for p = 3 (the d3-brane),
3 = 2, which is interpreted as evidence that there are indeed on the order of n 2 degrees
of freedom on the world-volume, as expected in a conformally invariant gauge theory with
gauge group su(n). for p = 2 (the m2-brane), 2 = 3/2. for p = 5 (the m5-brane),
5 = 3. cross-sections of minimal scalars falling into any of these branes have the same
n p scaling [24,25]. we note for the record that p = d3
d5 where d is one plus the number
of spatial dimensions perpendicular to the brane world-volume.
in the grand-canonical ensemble, the ratio of charge to mass where stability is lost for
q = q 2
3 =
q = 13 = (5)1/2]. on the other hand, in the q  0 limit, the critical mass
3] in d = 4 [d = 7]. thus
the d = 4 and d = 7 results are in a peculiar numerological sense dual to one another. for
the case of r-charged black holes in d = 5, the large black hole stability constraint and that

large r-charged black holes in d = 4 [d = 7] is most eciently expressed as q r+
(2)1/2 [r r4
where stability is lost can be determined from r+ = 13 [r+ = q 2

+

of q = 0 are self-dual: r r2

+

q = 12 = (3)1/2 for large q, and r+ = 12 for small q.

viii. conclusions

one of the motivations for this work was the question, what happens in a quantum
theory of gravity when a black hole becomes thermodynamically unstable? string theory
in principle provides us with a venue to address this question.
in general, however, the
black holes of which one has a good string theory description are thermodynamically stable.
a possible exception, rst noted in [5], is d3-branes with spin, by which we mean angular
momentum in a plane transverse to the world-volume. these objects, which we have shown
to reduce to charged black holes in ads5, can become unstable due to excessively large
spinor, in the ve-dimensional picture, excessive charge.

we had initially hoped to show that the charge-driven instability of black holes in ads5
could be understood in terms of the hawking-page transition: that is, for the black holes
which were thermodynamically unstable, there would be a transition to a gas of charged
particles in pure anti-de sitter space. to a rst approximation, this transition occurs when
the euclidean action of the black hole solution rises above the euclidean action for pure
anti-de sitter space subjected to the same boundary conditions at spatial innity.

this hope was only partly substantiated, and an intricate phase diagram realized,
through analytic treatments of the local thermodynamic stability conditions and of the
criterion for the hawking-page transition. holding temperature and electric potential xed,
we found in particular that there is a region of phase space where the black hole solution
is locally unstable (that is, it is only a saddle point and not a local minimum of the eu-
clidean action), but where pure anti-de sitter space has a still higher action! in this region,
neither the black hole solution nor the gas of particles in anti-de sitter space can be the
preferred state of the system. the only option we can suggest at this point is that the pre-
ferred conguration is not spherically symmetric with respect to rotations about its center
of mass in ads5, despite the fact that it has no angular momentum in ads5spin is angular

26

momentum in the s5 directions. for instance, one might hope for a multi-black hole cong-
uration. fragmentation of highly charged black holes would be a truly novel phenomenon,
but it does have some intuition behind it: near-extreme d3-branes which spin too fast seem
likely to split apart into chunks which move out in the radial direction (which becomes a
dimension in ads5 upon kaluza-klein reduction). the chunks could carry o some of the
spin as orbital angular momentum in the s5 directions. the ten-dimensional geometry we
are envisioning is neither stationary nor static, but it does seem that its ve-dimensional
analog is a multi-black hole geometry. we hope that progress can be made in nding such a
ve-dimensional geometry, or in proving that it cannot exist by some extension of the known
uniqueness theorems for black hole geometries.

before we get carried away with the possibilities for quantum ssion of black holes, we
should point out that the conclusions depend on whether total charge or electric potential
is held xed. if total charge is held xed, then in all the cases we considered (d = 4 and
d = 7 as well as d = 5), for each black hole geometry which is locally thermodynamically
unstable, there is a pure anti-de sitter geometry with the same total charge and periodicity
of euclidean time which is entropically preferred in the sense that it has smaller euclidean
action. thus for xed total charge, our initial hope is realized: black holes which get too
highly charged to exist in equilibrium with a heat bath undergo a hawking-page transition.
as usual in rst order phase transitions, it is also possible for the black hole solution to
represent a local minimum of the euclidean action (i.e. a local maximum of the entropy),
to equilibrate with a heat bathin short to lead a stable existencebut nevertheless not
to be the global minimum of the action. if one waits long enough, such meta-stable black
holes should quantum tunnel to a gas of particles in ads (plus perhaps a locally unstable
black hole which then decays quickly into the heat bath).

as we have indicated in subsection iii a, the choice of ensemble depends on physical
motivation. in the case of spinning branes, where the world-volume is innite and one is
really considering a black brane geometry where any part of the world-volume can act as a
heat bath for any other part, the grand canonical ensemble seems the appropriate one for
judging local stability. for black holes in anti-de sitter space, the situation is less clear. our
gravity intuition is that a conserved charge should be held xed when studying a localized
object (the black hole). that is, we should use the canonical ensemble. but if gravity is
wholly reected in the gauge theory on the boundary, it seems that, at least in k  0+
limit where the world-volume of the gauge theory is much larger than the cube of its inverse
temperature, the same arguments that applied to spinning branes tell us that we should
be using the grand canonical ensemble. we have yet to resolve this issue to our complete
satisfaction.

most of our results were obtained in the case of a single charge non-zero. the number of
independent charges is the rank of the gauged supergravitys gauge group, or in the language
of spinning branes the number of mutually orthogonal planes perpendicular to the brane
world-volume. however, our analysis lays the groundwork for an exploration of multiple
non-zero angular momenta. in particular, we have obtained explicit closed forms for the
euclidean actions, both with charges held xed and with potentials held xed, for arbitrary
numbers of charges up to the maximum number allowed: three for the d3-brane, four for
the m2-brane, and two for the m5-brane. using these actions to locate the hawking-page
transition is straightforward: the way we have set up the calculations, the transition takes

place when the action is zero. evaluating the local stability constraints may be feasible in
the general case for the canonical ensemble, but it is exceedingly calculationally burdensome
in the grand-canonical ensemble because determinants of matrices with up to ve rows and
columns are involved. in the case of large black holes we have been able to evaluate these
determinants. this and other issues will be reported on in [6].
