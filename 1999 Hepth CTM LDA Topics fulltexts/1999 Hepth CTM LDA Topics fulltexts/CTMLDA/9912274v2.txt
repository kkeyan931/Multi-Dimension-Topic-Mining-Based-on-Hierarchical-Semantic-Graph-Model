we study wittens open string eld theory in the presence of a constant b eld. we

construct the string eld theory in the operator formalism and nd that, compared to the

ordinary theory with no b eld, the vertices in the resulting theory has an additional factor.

the factor makes the zero modes of strings noncommutative. this is in agreement with the

results in the rst-quantized formulation. we also discuss background independence of the

purely cubic action derived from the above string eld theory and then nd a redenition

of string elds to remove the additional factor from the vertex. furthermore, we briey

discuss the supersymmetric extension of our string eld theory.

1. introduction

since the appearance of the seminal paper [1], noncommutative geometry has received

much attention in matrix theory and string theory [2,3]. see [3] for further references. in

string theory, we have the familiar antisymmetric tensor eld bij which directly couples

to fundamental strings. if we turn on the background b eld, spacetime becomes noncom-

mutative on d-branes with the nonvanishing b eld. d-branes can be described by open

strings whose ends are on the d-branes [4]. by the quantization of the open strings, we

have gauge eld on the d-branes, and the low-energy eective theory of the gauge eld

are described by the dirac-born-infeld (dbi) action [5]. therefore, turning on the b eld,

we can nd the dbi action on the noncommutative space.

recently, seiberg and witten have shown that the noncommutative dbi action is

equivalent to the ordinary one [3]. to prove the equivalence, they have given a relation

between the gauge elds in the noncommutative dbi action and the ordinary one [3]. some

closely related topics have been discussed in [6,7]. however, at present it seems unclear

how we can embed the relation into a whole tower of the excitation modes of strings. to

uncover such a relation, string eld theories seems a natural framework, where we can deal

with string elds which include all the excitations as well as the gauge eld.

in the paper [8], witten has constructed, on a commutative at minkowski spacetime,

a covariant open string eld theory based on noncommutative geometry. this noncommu-

tativity comes from the nature of the way that open strings join together to become a new

string. therefore, we may expect that wittens string eld theory in the background b

eld has additional noncommutativity. in this paper, we will derive wittens open string

eld theory in the above-mentioned background in the operator formalism [9,10,11]. by

solving the overlap conditions, we will show that the string eld theory has an additional

factor in its vertex. this factor accounts for the noncommutativity of spacetime and is in

agreement with the result of [12,3] in the rst-quantized formulation. in [13], this factor

has also been found in wittens open string eld theory with a constant background mag-
netic eld fij. by the gauge invariance bij  bij + ij  ji, ai  ai + i, we can
see that this background is the same as ours. however, the physical signicance of this

factor has not been fully realized. also, open string eld theories in general backgrounds

have been discussed in terms of the conformal eld theory [14]. the string eld theory in

this paper could be studied in the same way.

pregeometrical string eld theories have been proposed to give a background indepen-

dent formulation of string theory [15,16]. in particular, the pregeometrical theory given in

1

[15] is wittens open string eld theory on a at minkowski spacetime without the kinetic

term and so it is sometimes referred to as purely cubic action. therefore, if we drop the

kinetic term from our string theory in the background b eld, it is tempting to ask whether

the resulting theory can be background independent. since the additional noncommuta-

tive factor explicitly depends on the background b eld, we may at rst think that it

cannot be background independent. if we dealt with a particle eld theory, this would be

true. however, as we will show in this paper, we can remove the noncommutative factor

from the three-string vertex by a redenition of string elds. in addition, we will explicitly

demonstrate that the three-string vertex is independent of the background metric which

we use to express the vertex in terms of the oscillators of strings. to this end, we will

apply the method given in [17] to open string eld theory.

this paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we construct wittens open string eld

theory in the background b eld by using the operator formalism and solving the overlap

conditions for the vertices. in section 3, we explicitly show background independence of our

pregeometrical theory in great detail. section 4 is devoted to discussion. in appendix a,

we briey summarize the operator formalism of the rst-quantized string theory [18,19]. in

appendix b, we give a derivation of yoneyas identities [11,20] of the neumann coecients

for wittens string eld theory, which we need in section 3.

when we had almost nished writing this paper, we found a paper [21] given by

sugino, which has considerable overlap with ours. the main dierence between that paper

and ours is the following two points. first, he argues that the dependence on the b eld can

be eliminated from our string eld theory by a redenition of string elds. this suggests

that we can gauge away the background eld. we will discuss this point in further detail

in section 4. second, we explicitly show background independence of our pregeometrical

theory. in section 4, we will also mention our main results about an open-closed string

eld theory with the light-cone type interaction [22] in the background we are considering.

furthermore, we will discuss the supersymmetric extension [23] of our string eld theory.

2. string field theory in background b-field

we study a bosonic open string eld theory proposed by witten [8] with a constant

metric gij and a constant antisymmetric eld bij. the open string eld theory in the

presence of background elds has been discussed in [14,24]. we show that we can construct

the eld theory in our background explicitly by using the operator formalism [9,10,11]. to

2

this end, it is appropriate to begin with a review of the operator formalism of the rst-

quantized string theory with the b eld [18,19]. in appendix a, we give a simple derivation

of the result given by [18,19] to make this paper self-contained.

in the rst-quantized string theory, the worldsheet action is given by

(2.1)

s = 

1

4 z d d(cid:0)gijabax ibx j  2bijabax ibx j(cid:1) ,

from this action, if the dirichlet boundary condition is not chosen for all the directions of
the string coordinates, the boundary condition can be seen to be gijx j  +(2)bij x j = 0
at  = 0, , where we denote the dierentiation with respect to  and  by the dot  and
the prime , respectively. for simplicity, in this paper, we impose this boundary condition
on all the string coordinates x i(, ). the conjugate momenta of the string coordinates
x i() turn out to be pi() = 1

2 gij x j() + bijx j 

().

the authors of [18,19] have shown that we can quantize our system by the dirac quan-

tization procedure if we treat the boundary condition as a constraint. see also appendix

a for further details. the resulting commutation relations can be seen to be

j (  ),

[pi(), pj()] = 0,

(cid:2)x i(), pj()(cid:3) = i i
(cid:2)x i(), x j()(cid:3) =


iij,
iij ,

0,

( =  = 0)
( =  = )
(otherwise),

(2.2)

where we use the same denitions of the open string metric gij and the theta parameter
ij as those in [3]:

g + 2b

1

gij =(cid:18)
ij = (2)2(cid:18)

g

1

g  2b(cid:19)ij

,

1

g + 2b

b

1

g  2b(cid:19)ij

(2.3)

.

as we can see from appendix a, the mode expansion of the string coordinates x i()

turns out to be

jqj(),
where x i() and qi() are dened with ls = 2 as follows:

x i() = x i() + (g)i

i
n

x i() = xi + lsxn6=0
gij pj(cid:16) 

qi() =

1


i

n cos(n),



2(cid:17) +

1

ls xn6=0

1
n

3

i

n sin(n).

(2.4)

(2.5)

we can see here that the variables x i() satisfy the neumann boundary condition. simi-
larly, the expansion of the momenta is

pi() =

1

ls xn

gijj

n cos(n).

note that qi() and pi() have the following relation:

qi() =z 


2

dgijpj() +

1
2

gij (pl j  pr j) ,

(2.6)

(2.7)

where we introduce the momentum operators integrated over half a string [25],


2

pl i =z

0

d pi(),

pr i =z 


2

d pi().

(2.8)

the commutation relations of these mode variables xi, pi, i

n can be veried [18,19] to be

[xi, pj ] = ii

j,

(cid:2)i

and the others vanish, as is seen from appendix a.

m, j

n(cid:3) = mm+ngij ,

(2.9)

the brs charge in string eld theories is necessary to construct their kinetic terms.

in order to obtain the brs charge, we need to know the energy-momentum tensor in the

worldsheet theory (2.1). while the contribution from the reparametrization ghosts to the

energy-momentum tensor is the same as usual, the energy-momentum tensor from the

matter sector, i.e. the string coordinates, can be found to be

t (z) = 
t (z) = 

1
 gijx ix j(z) = 
1
 gij x i x j(z) = 

1
 gij x i x j(z),
1
 gij  x i  x j(z),

(2.10)

with z = exp( + i). note from the boundary condition that t (z) = t (z) for z = z.
therefore, we can make use of the doubling technique for open strings to extend the

worldsheet of the upper half-plane to a whole complex plane when we dene the brs

charge by using the energy momentum tensor in the usual way.

in the rest of this section, we will construct a string eld theory with the mid-point

interaction in our background. to this end, the reector and the three-string vertex will be

constructed by using the overlap conditions, as usual. from the paper [12,3], we expect that

the noncommutativity of spacetime would also appear in our string eld theory, in addition

4

to the usual noncommutativity of an open string eld theory. this is actually the case, as

we will see below. although the mode expansion of the string coordinates is dierent from

that with the neumann boundary condition due to the presence of the background b-eld,

the resulting vertices will be shown to be the same as usual vertices except for one factor.

it is this factor that accounts for the noncommutativity of spacetime. by noncommutative

spacetime, we mean a spacetime such that, given two arbitrary functions f (x) and g(x)

on the space, the product of these functions is given by the moyal product

f  g(x) = f (x) exp(cid:20) i

2

ij i j(cid:21) g(x).

(2.11)

if we identify the zero mode x of string coordinates with coordinates of our spacetime,

the above-mentioned factor turns out to be the exponential factor in (2.11), as we will

show below.

besides the brs charge, in order to obtain a kinetic term in string eld theory, we
need the reector hr|, which is used to give the inner product of string elds. the reector
hr| is dened up to an overall normalization by the overlap conditions

hr|(cid:16)x i(1)
hr|(cid:16)p (1)

j

()  x i(2)
() + p (2)

j

(  )(cid:17) = 0,
(  )(cid:17) = 0.

(2.12)

since the ghost part of the reector remains unchanged even in our case, we will focus on

only the matter part of it. this will also be the case later for the three-string vertex. in a

case where  = 0, the matter part of the reector is thus given by

hrx| = (2)2626(p1 + p2)21 h0| exp

()n
n

gij i
n

(1)

j
n

(2.13)

xn1

(2)
 ,

where 21 h0| denotes 2 h0| 1 h0|. we can see that this reector still satises the connection
conditions (2.13) even in our case of  6= 0. therefore, using the brs charge qb and
the reector hr|, we can write the kinetic term of our string eld theory. obviously, this
kinetic term does not have any dependence of the theta parameter ij.

now, let us move on to the three-string vertex. the three-string vertex can also be

specied up to an overall normalization by the connection equations

hv3|(cid:16)x i(r)

(2.14)

where r = 1, 2, 3 denotes the r-th string and r + 3 equals r. before proceeding to solve

these equations, let us consider the three-string vertex with  = 0.

d v3(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:16) x i (r)()  x i (r+1)(  )(cid:17) = 0,

(2.15)

the variables x i() and pi() are expressed by the mode expansions of (2.4) and (2.6), and
these correspond to strings with the neumann boundary condition as mentioned above.

therefore, we nd that this vertex d v3(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

agrees with the usual three-string vertex given by

using (2.7), (2.4), and (2.15), we can evaluate how the string coordinates x i(r)

(2.20)

1 a similar expression for the three-string vertex has been discussed in [13].

thus, the three-string vertex in the background b eld can be obtained by multi-

plying the usual vertex d v3(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

, which is characteristic of a
noncommutative space. since the brs charge qb can be expressed by the variables x i()
and pj() and commute with the zero mode pj of the momenta, we can see that the

finally, we nd that our string eld theory has the following action:

b |i2 +

(2.21)

(2.22)

this  product is dierent from the ordinary product by the factor which represents the

noncommutativity of space-time, as we have mentioned above. but, except for this factor,

the action (2.22) is the same as that of the theory without b-eld. note that, in the

kinetic term, the ordinary product can be replaced by the  product due to the momentum

conservation. this action can be veried to be invariant under the gauge transformation

 = qb +       .

(2.23)

in the perturbative expansion of this string eld theory, if we expand the string eld

 by its component elds, for example, a tachyon eld and a vector eld, the product

of these component elds in the resulting eective action turns out to be the product of

functions on a noncommutative space. therefore, the low-energy eective theory becomes

noncommutative yang-mills theory. also, in this theory, we have the open string metric

gij, but not the closed one gij. this is in agreement with the result in [3].

3. background independence of string field theory

as a background independent formulation of string theory, pregeometrical string eld

theories have been proposed in [15,16], where they dropped the kinetic terms from the

actions of the ordinary string eld theories on a at minkowski space and kept only a

cubic term.

7

if we drop the kinetic term of our string eld theory, we may expect the resulting

theory to be a pregeometrical theory on the same footing as the theory proposed in [15].

in this section, we will show that this is the case. although it seems to depend on the
theta parameter ij, we will nd that its background dependence can be absorbed into a

redenition of a string eld and that the resulting theory turns out to be the theory in [15].

in addition, we will explicitly show in the oscillator representation that the three-string

vertex is also independent of gij. this is an application of the method given by kugo and

zwiebach [17] to wittens open string eld theory.

in [17], background independence has been discussed in  = p+ closed hikko theory
compactied on a torus. kugo and zwiebach proposed that x i() and pi() are indepen-
dent of background elds. we can therefore read the dependence of the oscillators on the

background elds, which allows us to explicitly verify in terms of the oscillators that the

three-string vertex is background independent.

however, in our open string eld theory, the coordinates x i() are no longer universal

objects, because the commutation relation of string coordinates itself depends on  as in
(2.2). what objects should we regard as universal ones? from eq. (2.4) and (2.7), x i()

can be rewritten as

x i() = x i() +z 


2

dijpj() +

1
2

ij(cid:0)plj  prj(cid:1) .

thus, x i() and pi() can be expressed by x i() and pi(). furthermore, their commu-
tation relations

h x i(), pj()i = i i

j (),

[pi(), pj()] = 0,

h x i(), x j()i = 0. (3.1)

have no apparent dependence on background elds. thus, we propose that x i() and
pi() are background independent objects. namely, under an innitesimal variation of
gij and ij,  x i() = 0 and pi() = 0. therefore, under the variation, we can obtain
the change of the oscillators

i

n = 

1
2

n + k

gij gjk(cid:0)k

n(cid:1) .

(3.2)

n can be seen to only depend upon the open string metric gij. this
the oscillators i
means that the theta parameter ij in our theory is only included in the above-mentioned

factor of the three-string vertex.

8

now, let us consider a purely cubic action with our three-string vertex

s =z      = 321 hv3||i1 |i2 |i3 .

(3.3)

if we expand the string eld around a classical solution as  = qli + , we can recover
the action eq. (2.22), as discussed in [15]. here, ql is the brs charge density integrated
over the left half of a string, and, in terms of the oscillators, i can be given [10,11] by

|ii = exp

(3.4)

where m (r) = (i/2)ijpl

(r)
i pr

.

since the noncommutative factor can be given by the product of the operators em (r)
on the three-string vertex, we can eliminate it from the vertex by a redenition of string
elds   em , and we nd that our theory turns into the ordinary theory proposed
by [15], as we have mentioned before.

9

in the following two subsections, we will in turn discuss the dependence of our theory

(3.3) on the theta parameter ij and on the open string metric gij .

3.1. similarity transformation of string fields and the theta parameter

the three-string vertex in our theory diers from that in [15] by the noncommutative

]. nothing but this factor depends on the theta param-

factor exp[(i/2)pr<s ijp(r)

i p(s)

j

eter, as we have seen previously. therefore, our theory at rst seems dependent on the
background eld ij. if we are dealing with a particle eld theory, say 3 theory, on a

noncommutative space, this is true. however, if, in our string theory, we can express the

noncommutative factor by a product of operators from each of the three strings, we can

eliminate the factor by a redenition of string elds. interestingly, this is indeed the case,

as we will show below. therefore, our pregeometrical theory is independent of the theta

parameter.

to this end, let us consider the operatorpr<s (i/2)ijp(r)
string vertexd v3(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
momentum conservation (2.18) on the vertex d v3(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

. this operator can be rewritten asp3

d v3(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

before examining the dependence of our theory on the open string metric, we would

like to make some comments about this similarity transformation. when we apply this

eld redenition to the theory we have discussed in the last section, we can eliminate the

noncommutative factor from the three-string vertex. but this redenition also aects the
kinetic term, and then the brs charge is transformed into em qbem . this transformed
brs charge can be found to have a divergent term in it. very recently, using an interesting

technique, sugino has argued that the transformed operator indeed remains the original

brs operator qb in the kinetic term [21]. this seems to imply that the background b eld
is physically meaningless. we would like to discuss this puzzle in some detail in section 4.

3.2. independence of three-string vertex from background metric

in the string eld theory, the reector and the three-string vertex are dened by

the overlap conditions up to an overall normalization. since the overlap conditions do

not include any background elds, we can expect that those vertices are independent of

background elds. but we need at least a background metric to concretely construct those

vertices in terms of the oscillators. therefore, it is interesting to examine background

independence of the vertices. in this subsection, we will consider the independence of the

from a background metric by using the method given by
kugo and zwiebach, who applied it to the  = p+ hikko closed string theory. we could

ordinary three-string vertex d v3(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

also study the background independence by using a general method given by sen [14].

before considering the three-string vertex, we will demonstrate the independence of

the reector from the open string metric, as an illustration of the method of [17]. in this

subsection, we will focus only on the matter sector.

the fock vacuum of string elds is dened by g h0| n = 0 for n  1, where the
oscillators n depend on the open string metric gij. thus, the vacuum g h0| also depends
on the metric gij . as we have seen in (3.2), the oscillators change under an innitesimal
variation of gij by i
n(cid:1). it is useful to introduce an operator

the part of the reector relevant to this paper is hrx|  21 h0| ee12 , where e12 is given
and we will omit the delta function of the zero

mode pj, which, as we have mentioned before, is background independent. by making use

[11] by e12 = pn1

thus, the reector is independent of the background gij.

is

4. discussion

in this paper, we derived wittens open string eld theory in a background b eld by

using the standard overlap conditions in the operator formalism. the resulting three-string

vertex naturally contains an additional factor which gives the moyal product to the zero
modes, compared to the ordinary vertex with no b eld. thus, the zero modes xi can be

found to be noncommutative. besides this noncommutative factor, the three-string vertex

can be written by using the open string metric gij. therefore, the low-energy eective

theory of the gauge eld should be described by noncommutative yang-mills theory. this

result is in agreement with the result in the rst-quantization formulation in [3,12].

following the idea of the pregeometrical formulation [15,16], we dropped the kinetic

term from our string eld theory and explicitly demonstrated background independence

of the resulting theory by using the method of [17].

in order to prove that the three-string vertex is independent of the theta parameter
ij, we have shown that the noncommutative factor can be eliminated by eld redenition.

if we also apply the redenition to the theory with the kinetic term, we can easily see that,

12

besides elimination of the noncommutative factor of the three-string vertex, it also aects
the kinetic term and transforms the brs charge qb into em qbem . here the operator
m is (i/2)ijpliprj. this transformed brs charge can be found to have a divergent
term in it. this divergent term seems to come from the mid-point  = /2 of strings.

very recently, using an interesting technique, sugino has argued [21] that the transformed

operator indeed remains the original brs operator qb in the kinetic term and that the

kinetic term is kept intact under the eld redenition. this seems to imply that the

background b eld is physically meaningless.

in the paper [3], seiberg and witten have shown that the noncommutative dirac-

born-infeld (dbi) action is equivalent in the slowly varying eld approximation to the

commutative dbi action with the background b eld. in addition, they emphasized that

the b eld parallel to d-branes cannot be gauged away, due to the gauge invariance
bij  bij + ij  ji, ai  ai + i. here ai is the gauge eld on the d-branes.
therefore, to be consistent with the result in [3], we may expect that, even after the eld

redenition, the dependence of the b eld remains in the kinetic term of the string eld

theory and that the b eld appears in the low-energy eective action only through the
gauge-invariant combination fij = bij +fij . however, it apparently seems to conict with
suginos recent result [21]. thus, we think that we have an interesting puzzle to solve.

to our knowledge, there is no literature which shows that wittens open string eld

theory has the above-mentioned gauge invariance. in addition, it seems dicult to prove

it, because the theory has no explicit eld from the closed string sector in its action. for

this purpose, it may be more suitable to study the gauge invariance and the dependence

of b eld in an open-closed string eld theory with the mid-point interaction in [26].

apart from the gauge invariance, we would like to discuss the operator m which was

used for the eld redenition. if we do not use suginos technique to show that the kinetic

term remains intact by the eld redenition, we have to deal with the divergent term
in em qbem . this divergent term seems to come from the mid-point of strings, as we

mentioned above. since the operator m consists of the half-integrated momenta pl, pr,

we are led to wonder if the singularity may be related to the mid-point interaction. in

addition, the operator m seems to be suitable only to the mid-point interaction, because

we cannot apply it to the light-cone type interaction. since the kinetic term of string

eld theories does not depend on types of interactions of strings, it is desirable to have a

13

eld redenition which is independent of types of string interactions. therefore, it may be

useful to introduce another candidate

m (r) on the usual three-string vertexd v3(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

, we can see that the
second terms in the operators m (r) cancel each other, due to the overlap condition (2.15).
furthermore, as we will mention just below, this operator m can be used to give the eld

r=1

redenition to remove the noncommutative factor from the light-cone type interactions.

we have so far been discussing the problem with the mid-point interaction concerning

the relation between our string eld theory and the ordinary one. however, it is plausible

that, if there is such a relation, we can nd the same relation in other string eld theories.

in particular, since we cannot apply the operator m to string eld theories with the light-

cone type interaction like that given by [22], we can expect that the dependence on the b

eld cannot completely be removed. therefore, in order to get some clue to this problem, it

may be helpful to study the string eld theory with the light-cone type interaction [22] by
using the operator m . since this theory explicitly has closed string elds in its lagrangian

as well as open strings, it may also help to nd some relation between the condensation of

the antisymmetric tensor bij from the closed string eld and the above redenition of the

open string eld.

now, let us just sketch in the main points of our results about the string eld theory

with the light-cone type interaction [22] in the background b eld. these results will

be explained in more detail in another paper [27]. as we can verify by the method we

have explained in section 2, the light-cone type vertices are also modied to include the

noncommutative factor, and there is no other modication due to the background b-eld.
this noncommutative factor can be expressed by a product of the operators m from each
string. since the operator m thus plays an important role, it is useful to make some

comments on it.

if we naively exchange the order of the summations in the right-hand side of (4.3), we

obtain [ m , x i()] = (g)i
x i(). but this consequence must be false because it is inconsistent with the commutation
relation [x i(), x j()]  ij, which cannot be changed to be [ x i(), x j()] = 0 by
the similarity transformation e m x i() e m . a closer examination shows that the relation
[ m , x i()] = (g)i
j qj() holds only for 0 <  < . therefore, the transformed brs
operator e m qb e m naively becomes the ordinary brs operator with the closed string
metric gij, but, due to subtleties from the ends of strings, it has additional terms for

which, at least at present, we do not have any interpretations. in spite of the discrepancy
between e m x i() e m and x i(), since the operator m allows us to relate our three-string
vertex to the ordinary vertex, regardless of types of string interactions, we are tempted
to speculate that the operator m would give us some clue about a relation between the
noncommutative string eld theory and the ordinary one, like the relation found by seiberg

and witten [3] between noncommutative dbi theory and commutative one.

finally, we would like to touch on superstring eld theory. we can easily extend our

theory to wittens superstring eld theory [23] by constructing other necessary vertices in

a similar way to the bosonic case. in the worldsheet picture of superstring theory, we add

to the bosonic sector

s = 

and the boundary conditions are given by

1

4 z d2z(cid:16)giji j + gij i j(cid:17) ,

(g + 2b)ij(z) = (g  2b)ij (z),

at z = z.

it is convenient to introduce new elds i(z), i(z) dened by

i(z) = gij (g + 2b)jkk(z)
i(z) = gij (g  2b)jk k(z)

15

(4.4)

(4.5)

(4.6)

these elds play a similar role to the string coordinates x i in the bosonic case. since
the elds i(z) and i(z) satisfy the same boundary condition as that with no b eld,
we have the ordinary mode expansion of these elds i(z), i(z). therefore, solving the

overlap conditions for these elds, we obtain the ordinary three-string vertex as well as the

ordinary reector. the oscillator expression of the vertices can be found in [28,11]. from

(4.6), we can immediately verify that these vertices also satisfy the overlap conditions for
(z), (z). moreover, the picture changing operators can be expressed by using only i(z),
i(z) and x i, and can be found to have the ordinary expression. thus, we can extend

our string eld theory to superstring cases, though we are still faced with the mid-point
singularity problem as in [29].2

appendix a. operator formalism of strings in a background b-field

we consider the operator formalism of rst-quantized string theory in a constant

background b eld by following the papers [18,19]. although chu and ho have discussed

dierent methods of quantization in their rst and second papers of [18], our strategy

is slightly dierent from both of them; namely, we simplify their methods by combining

them.

the worldsheet action is given by

s =

4 z d d(cid:0)gijabax ibx j  2bijabax ibx j(cid:1) ,

(a.1)

2 recently, a new approach has been proposed to solve this diculty [30].

where gij is a constant background metric and bij is a constant background antisymmetric
tensor. we will also denote (2)bij by bij. the signature of the worldsheet metric ab
is (, +) and the invariant antisymmetric tensor ab is dened by 01 = 1. the equation
of motion of the string coordinates is aabbx i = 0. the boundary condition turns out
to be

gijx j + 2bij x j = 0

(a.2)

at  = 0, . the conjugate momenta are given by pi = (1/2)gij x j + bijx j, where

we can obtain the hamiltonian density

(a.3)

here, the open string metric gij is given by gij = gij  (bg1b)ij. the poisson brackets
of the string coordinates and the momenta are all vanishing except (cid:8)x i(), pj()(cid:9)p =
j(  ).
i

the idea in the second paper of [18] and in [19] was to deal with the boundary
condition (a.2) as a constraint i = gijx j + (2)bikgkjpj in the operator formalism
and to quantize the system by following the dirac quantization method. by using the

consistency condition i = {i, h}p  0 with the hamiltonian h =r dh, all the second

class constraints are found [18,19] to be

2ni
2n () = 0,

2n+1pi
2n+1 () = 0,

(a.4)

with n  0 at  = 0, , and there is no rst class constraint. here, we rst solve these
constraints (a.4) and nd that

i() =

pi() =

therefore, using ij = (2)(g1bg1)ij, we obtain

(a.6)

chu and ho in their rst paper of [18] expressed the string coordinates as a mode

expansion in terms of the solutions of the equation of motion and used the invariant

symplectic form

 =z d(cid:2)dx i()  dpi() + dpi()  dx i()(cid:3)

17

(a.7)

to nd the commutation relations of the modes. now we apply their idea to our system

by using the above mode expansion of string coordinates and the momenta, instead of the

mode expansion in terms of the solutions of the equation of motion, to nd the commutation
relations of xi
variables xi

n and pnj. after this procedure, we will nd the equation of motion of these
n and pnj . substituting the expansions (a.5) and (a.6) into the symplectic

form (a.7), we nd the poisson brackets of the modes to be

(cid:8)xi
0, p0j(cid:9)p =

(cid:8)xi
n, pmj(cid:9)p =

(a.8)

and the others are vanishing. since these variables xi

n and pnj are the solutions of the
constraints (a.4), they are all physical variables. thus, we can obtain the commutation
relations of them by the usual prescription [a, b] = i{a, b}p to quantize our system.

since the time derivative of a physical variable o can be obtained by o = {o, h}p ,
we can see that i() = (2)p 
i(). substituting the mode
expansion (a.5) into these equations to get the equations of motion of the variables xi
n

pi() = (1/2)

and pnj and solving the resulting equations, we nd that

these new mode variables i

j ,

(cid:2)xi, xj(cid:3) = iij,

(cid:2)i

m, j

n(cid:3) = mgij m+n.

(a.10)

these commutation relations are in agreement with the results in [18]. note here that, if
we dene new center of mass coordinates xi by xi = xi + (1/2)ijpj, the coordinates xi

turn out to be commutative variables; (cid:2)xi, xj(cid:3) = 0.

finally, with the mode variables i

the neumann function and its  derivative are continuous at the interaction time r = 0,

provided that we use momentum conservation for the zero mode parts. in other words, in

order to hold its continuity, it is necessary to multiply the factor ps p(s) to the zero mode

terms 2rs max(r,
