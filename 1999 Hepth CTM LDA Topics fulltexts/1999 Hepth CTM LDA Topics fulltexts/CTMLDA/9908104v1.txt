abstract

we construct a new model with exponential mass hierarchy by starting with the

einstein-hilbert action with the cosmological constant in ve dimensions plus an action

describing many domain walls in four dimensions. the model includes many hidden

sectors and one visible sector, and each four-dimensional domain wall, that is, 3-brane,

interacts with one another through only a gravitational interaction and realizes many

universe cosmology inspired by d-brane perspective.

it is shown that in the present

model only even numbers of domain walls are allowed to locate in ve dimensional

space-time and the validity of randall-sundrum scenario, which explains mass hierarchy

between the planck mass and the electro-weak scale in our world, depends on a relative

relation between our world and hidden worlds.

recently, there has been considerable interest and activity in the higher dimensional the-
ories to solve the hierarchy problem. it is well known that in the standard model based on
the gauge group su(3)  su(2)  u(1) there exist two scales, those are, the electro-weak
scale mew  103 gev and the planck scale mp l  1019 gev. the hierarchy problem is a
problem concerning the two mass scales. the light higgs mass mew  103 gev is needed in
the standard model, but the quadratic divergences at the loop levels and the renormalization
eects associated with the light higgs eld cause this electro-weak mass to have the very
huge planck mass mp l  1019 gev, which corresponds to the cut-o scale of the ultra-violet
divergences. thus, solving the hierarchy problem is equivalent to explaining the vast dispar-
ity and quantum stability of the two scales without any ne tuning of parameters at each
perturbation level.

in recent works, it has been pointed out that the existence of large extra compact spatial
dimensions might give us a solution for the hierarchy problem [1, 2]. the key idea is the fol-
lowing: in the simple case, the four-dimensional planck scale mp l and the (4 +n)-dimensional
planck scale m have a relation m 2
c where rc is a compactication radius. even
if m is around the order of the electro-weak scale, mp l can become the planck scale by
taking rc to be large enough. but against this naive expectation, it was found that in this
scenario the mass hierarchy is merely converted into another hierarchy problem between the
electro-weak scale and the compactication radius.

p l = m n+2

 rn

subsequently, a new scenario has been proposed for the hierarchy problem without appeal-
ing to large extra compactication dimensions [3]. according to this new scenario, the large
hierarchy of the planck scale and the electro-weak scale is explained by the nontrivial redshift
factor arisinging from the boundary condition where an extra dimension has a structure of an
orbifold s1/z2. the model used in the analysis is obtained by m-theory compactied on an
s1/z2 and a deformed calabi-yau threefold [4, 5] and has been examined in detail by several
groups [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

the above model [3] describes our world as one of four-dimensional two slabs in ve-
dimensional space-time while the other slab is regarded as a hidden world which interacts
with our world by a gravitational interaction. although the model is quite of interest from
the perspective of m-theory as mentioned above, it might be possible to construct a new
model based on the idea of d-branes [14] where an arbitrary number of paralell d-branes
are located at various places in the fth dimensional direction in the bulk and interact with
one another by a gravitational force. indeed, such a model also appears to be welcome from
cosmology since in modern cosmology our universe (visible 3-brane) is conjectured to be not
a unique and selected universe but have been created with other many universes (hidden
3-branes) simultaneously on an equal footing in the big bang era. thus it is interesting to
construct a new model with one visible world and many hidden worlds and ask how mass
hierarchy (and cosmological constant) problem is resolved. the purpose of this paper is to
pursue this line of thoughts, present such a concrete model and then show that the validity of
a scenario proposed by randall-sundrum [3] explaining mass hierarchy depends on a relative
relation between our world and hidden worlds. as a bonus, it turns out that one disadvantage

1

of the previous model, the necessity for a singular orbifold geometry [13], will disappear in
the present model since the existence of solutions of the einstein equation demands us to
choose a smooth manifold s1 in place of a singular orbifold geometry s1/z2 when there are
more than two branes in a theory.

we start with the einstein-hilbert action with the cosmological constant in ve dimensions

plus an action describing n domain walls in four dimensions [3, 6]:

s =

22 z d4xz 2l

0

dzg (r + 2) +

n

d4xgili,

where the cosmological constant  is taken to a positive number, which implies that the
geometry of ve-dimensional bulk is anti-de sitter space-time. (note that we have changed
the sign in front of the cosmological constant compared to a conventional choice so the positive
cosmological constant corresponds to the anti-de sitter space-time.) the fth dimension z is
compact with the size 2l. moreover,  denotes the ve-dimensional gravitational constant
with a relation 2 = 8gn = 8
where gn and m are the ve-dimensional newton constant
m 2
and the ve-dimensional planck scale, respectively.
in this article we follow the standard
conventions of the textbook of misner, thorne and wheeler [15]. it is edifying to mention two
dierences between our starting action and that of previous works [3]. an obvious dierence
is that we have introduced not two domain walls but n many domain walls located at li in
the z direction.2 (precisely speaking, all z = li are not always occupied by domain walls.
as shown later, the einstein equation xes locations of domain walls completely.) another
important dierence lies in the fact that in the previous m-theory model [3] the two domain
walls are located at the boundaries which are the xed points of an orbifold s1/z2, whereas
in the present d-brane model the fth dimension has a topology of s1 so that various domain
walls are not located at the boundary.

variation of the action (1) with respect to the ve-dimensional metric tensor leads to the

einstein equation:

g(cid:18)rm n

gm n r(cid:19) = ggm n  + 2

n

xi=1

gig
i m

 n

 li(z  li),

(2)

where m, n, ... denote ve-dimensional indices, whereas , , ... do four-dimensional ones.
in deriving this equation, we have neglected the contributions from the lagrangians li of
domain walls. in other words, the domain wall actions play a role as sources only providing
the cosmological constant in the bulk.

in order to solve the equation (2) in an analytical way, we require the following metric
ansatz in such a way that the red-shift factor and expanding universe are taken into account:

ds2 = gm n dxm dxn

2in recent work [12], many branes are also considered from a dierent context.

= u(z)2(cid:16)dt2 + v(t)2d~x2(cid:17) + b(z)2dz2,

(3)

where ~x denotes the three-dimensional spatial coordinates. under the ansatz (3), the einstein
equation (2) reduces to three combined dierential equations:

present model to cosmology will be examined in a separate paper [16] so we shall take v(t) = 1
from now on in order to focus our attention on mass hierarchy. moreover, we set b(t) = rc
where rc is a constant.

now we wish to nd a solution which satises the above einstein equations (9), (10).
however, it seems to be dicult to nd a general solution, so instead we aim to nd some

3

special solutions closely relating to a model with exponential mass hierarchy, whose concrete
expression is given by

u(z) = ekrcf (z),

(12)

where f (z) is a certain function of variable z to be determined in what follows. the most
eective and easiest way of determining the function f (z) is to construct it in a direct manner
according to the following procedure. first, divide the region 0 < z < 2l into (n  1) small
pieces li < z < li+1(i = 1, 2,   , n  1). second, combine two adjacent pieces into one pair
in order from l1 = 0 or ln = 2l, from which we have n1
2 distinct pairs. (we assume that
n is an odd number for a while. this issue will be argued later.) third, draw a piecewisely
continuous straight line with a slope +1 or 1 in each pair by turns. finally, since the
topology of the fth dimension is a circle s1 the two boundaries z = l1  0 and z = ln  2l
are identied by setting the periodic boundary condition. then except one point mentioned
shortly, it is straightforward to show that the line obtained in this way satises the einstein
equations (9), (10) by using the fourier series expansion.

here one would like to discuss an important subtlety associated with the denition of
(0). in showing that eq.(12) with f (z) obtained in the above procedure satises the einstein
equations (9), (10) one encounters the step function (x) dened as

(x) = |x|
x

= ( +1,
1,

for x > 0

for x < 0

.

(13)

at some li on which domain walls sit, we have an ambiguous quantity (0), for which we
usually dene as (0) = 0 or (0) = 1. the validity of the einstein equation now requires
us to choose (0) = 1. thus at rst sight we do not meet any inconsistency, but various
results should not depend on such an ambiguous quantity. indeed, in the situation at hand
this quantity has a close connection with a physical fact, namely, the existence of singularities
at the location of domain walls, so a careful treatment is needed. in this article, in order to
avoid an ambiguous quantity (0), we wish to regularize our model in a such way that we
introduce an innitely small thickness  of domain walls and take a limit   0 after all
calculations. under this regularization, any ambiguity never occur.
let us present two interesting solutions. these solutions describe even domain walls
standing along s1 at some intervals in ve dimensional space-time. one solution is given by

f (z) = |z| +

with i = 1, 2,   , n1

2 ) must satisfy the relations

(15)

(16)

this solution expresses n1
even domain walls locating at l2i. in this paper, we would like
2
to take account of one visible 3-brane and many hidden 3-branes more than or equal to 1 so
n runs over 5, 9, 13,  .

another interesting solution takes the form

n1

f (z) =

f (z) =

f (z) = 2

xi=2
(1)i+1(z  li)  1,
xi=1
xi=1

(1)i+1(z  li),

n1

(17)

where li also satises eq.(15). this time, li (i = 1, 2,   , n1

2 ) must satisfy the relations

3k
2rc

,

l1 = ln = 
l2i = l2j+1 =

6k
2rc

,

(18)

where 0 < j < i. now the number of domain walls is an even number n  1 (n takes values
3, 5, 7,  ), and the domain walls are located at li (i = 1, 2,   , n  1). at this stage, one
might ask whether it is possible to nd a solution with odd domain walls or not. the answer
does not seem to be armative. the reason is that as in an orbifold geometry s1/z2 [3], the
solutions obtained in this paper have a characteristic feature that number of positive energy
branes equals to number of negative energy branes, so the resulting solutions always include
even domain walls.

now let us turn to our main question. how is mass hierarchy problem resolved in our
many universe model? we will see that the answer is quite of interest and shows a peculiar
feature of many universe model. first of all, let us consider the rst model (14).
in this
model, domain walls are located at z = l2i (i = 1, 2,   , n1
2 ). let us suppose that a visible
3-brane (our universe) is located at a certain z = l2i, whereas the remaining 3-branes are
hidden sectors (the other universes). we wish to measure mass scale in our world placed at
z = l2i by mass scale in a hidden world placed at z = l2j(i 6= j), to which we assume that

5

the planck mass is assigned. according to formulas given in [3], we can in general evaluate
mass scale in our world by using eqs.(12), (14):

m(l2i) =

u(l2i)
u(l2j)

m(l2j)

= m(l2j) exp


krc
l2i  l2j +


n1

xl=1


(1)l (|l2i  l2l|  |l2j  l2l|)



. (19)

to compare the result (19) to that of [3], let us rst recall the result of [3] and then see
the implications of our result in the two specic cases. in the setup of ref.[3], there are two
3-branes with opposite sign of potential energy. for a 3-brane with positive potential energy,
a natural scale for mass is assumed to be of order the planck mass. if the standard model (our
universe) is placed on another 3-brane with negative potential energy, the graviton amplitude
is exponentially suppressed and exponential mass hierarchy is generated. to have this fact
in mind, let us see what happens in our model. from the action (1) and (16), it turns out
that 3-branes located at z = l4i2 have negative brane energy while 3-branes at z = l4i
have positive brane energy. thus, for instance, let us calculate mass scale at z = l2 from
mass scale at z = l4, for which we assume that the planck mass is assigned. note that this
situation is similar to that of [3] as mentioned above. a simple calculation yields

m(l2) = m(l4)ekrc(l4l2).

(20)

this result means that exponential mass hierarchy also occurs in the present model as in
[3]. note that this result is universal in the sense that the essential behavior of the result
remains unchanged as long as our 3-brane has negative brane energy and the hidden 3-brane
has positive brane energy even if a factor l4  l2 in the exponential changes depending on
which 3-branes we consider. an interesting feature of our model is the existence of many
branes with negative and positive brane energy, so we are now led to ask how the result about
mass hierarchy is modied when we take account of two 3-branes with same sign of brane
energy. to be specic, let us consider a situation where we attempt to measure mass scale at
z = l2 from mass scale at z = l6, of which both the 3-branes have negative brane energy. in
this case the general result (19) reduces to

m(l2) = m(l6)e

1

2 krc(l3+l5l7),

(21)

which implies that there is also exponential mass hierarchy if l3 + l5 > l7. but if this
inequality does not hold, then the planck mass scale allocated in hidden sector is exponentially
enhanced to the larger mass scale in our world. it is easy to check that the essential feature
of this conclusion is also universal as far as two 3-branes with same sign of brane energy are
concerned.

next, let us focus on the second model (17). in this model, domain walls are located at

z = li (i = 1, 2,   , n  1). again, a simple calculation gives us

m(li) =

u(li)
u(lj)

m(lj)

6

= m(lj) exp(krc

(1)l+1 (|li  ll|  |lj  ll|)) .

n1

xl=2

(22)

from the action (1) and (18), we see that 3-branes located at z = l2i have negative brane
energy while 3-branes at z = l2i1 have positive brane energy. thus, as in the rst model,
for instance, let us calculate mass scale at z = l2 from mass scale at z = l1 = 0, for which
we take the planck mass. the result is of the form

m(l2) = m(0)ekrcl2.

(23)

indeed, this result is the same as in [3]. (recall that for comparison we have to set l2 to .)
an interesting thing here is that this holds true even if there are many hidden sectors and
the topology is a circle s1 instead of an orbifold s1/z2. therefore, again we have exponential
mass hierarchy even in the second model. moreover, it is straightforward to show that even if
we take account of two 3-branes with same sign of brane energy we have also exponential mass
hierarchy if a suitable inequality holds like the rst model. finally, let us consider mass scale
of branes at z = l2i1. since we have an equation u(l2i1) = 1, the branes at these locations
have special feature. namely, if we attempt to evaluate mass scale at z = l2i1 from mass
scale at z = l2j1 with i 6= j, there is no mass hierarchy, in other words, m(l2i1) = m(l2j1).
however, this is an artifact of the model. in fact, we can modify the value of u(l2i1) from
one to a non-zero constant without violating the validity of the einstein equation, so in such
a situation we have exponential mass hierarcy as before.

to summarize, we have investigated a possibility of constructing a new model with an
exponential mass hierarchy whose existence is inspired by the perspective of d-brane theory
and many universe cosmology. in our model, the fth dimension has a topology s1 rather
than a singular orbifold s1/z2, which is one of advantages in our model. it was shown that
even in the present model, we have the exponential mass hierarchy under an appropriate
condition. however, there are many universes in the present model, perhaps our universe and
the other many hidden universes, so there is a priori no way of determining which universe
our universe is among many universes. hence, the correct interpretation of our results is
the following: mass scale in our universe depends on a relative distance relation along the
fth dimension between our universe and hidden universes. maybe once god created many
universes and gave the planck scale to one (or some) universe(s) in the beginning of the
big bang, mass scales in various universes are xed by a relative relation among universes.
according to this new scenario, each universe should have not more than one but exactly
one low (or high) energy scale, and our world happens to have taken the electro-weak scale
as such a low energy scale. although we have so far presented only two types of solutions
which satisfy the einstein equation and have simple and manageable forms, we have also
examined the other solutions in some detail [16]. the conclusion is almost the same as in
the present cases, so we think that the two solutions account for the essential features in our
theory. one disadvantage of our model as well as the randall-sundrum original model [3] is
the existence of 3-branes with negative potential energy. recently, an alternative setup has

7

been put forward where only positive energy objects are taken into account [13]. we wish to
investigate a possibility of generalizing our model to such a direction in future.
