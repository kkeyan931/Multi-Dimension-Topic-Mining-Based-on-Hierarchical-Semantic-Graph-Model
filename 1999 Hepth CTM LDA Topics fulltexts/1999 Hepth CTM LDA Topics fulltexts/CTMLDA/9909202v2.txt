abstract

taking advantage of the equivalence between supersymmetric yang-mills theory on
non-commutative spaces and the eld theory limit of d3-branes in the background
of nsns 2-form eld, we investigate the static properties of magnetic monopoles and
dyons using brane construction techniques. when parallel d3-branes are separated by
turning on a higgs vacuum expectation value, d-strings will stretch between them at
an angle which depends on the value of the background 2-form potential. these states
preserve half of the supersymmetries and have the same masses as their commutative
counterparts in the eld theory limit. we also nd stable (p, q)-dyons and string
junctions.

1 introduction

quantum eld theories on non-commutative geometries have received renewed attention
recently following the observation that they arise naturally as a decoupled limit of open string
dynamics on d-branes [1]. in the formalism of [1], supersymmetric yang-mills theory on
non-commutative geometry (ncsym) arises from fourier transforming the winding modes
of d-branes living in a transverse torus in the presence of nsns 2-form background [2]. to
be concrete, consider a d-string oriented along the 01-plane and localized on a square torus
in the 23-plane in the background of b23. in the absence of b23, the fourier transform is
equivalent to acting by t-duality in the 23-directions. in the presence of the b23, however,
the fourier transform (i) and t-duality (ii) acts dierently. on one hand, (i) gives rise to
the ncsym with non-commutativity scale

[x, x] = i ,

 = b.

(1.1)

on the other hand, (ii) gives rise to d3-branes in the nsns 2-form background. the precise
map of degrees of freedom between (i) and (ii) is highly non-local and was described in a
recent paper [3] as a perturbative series in the non-commutativity parameter . the physics
of (i) at large t hooft coupling can further be related to (ii) in the near horizon region [4, 5]
in the spirit of the ads/cft correspondence [6]. yet, these equivalences have contributed
very little to the understanding of the localized observables in the ncsym. the diculty
stems largely from the fact that we do not yet understand the encoding of the observables
in one formulation in terms of the other with sucient detail.

to study the localized structures, it is natural to introduce localized probes. topologi-
cally stable solution such as a magnetic monopole seems particularly suited for such a task.
instantons on non-commutative space-times have also been studied [7] along this line.

in this article, we will study the static properties of magnetic monopoles, dyons, and other
related structures in the ncsym with n = 4 supersymmetry1. since the non-commutativity
modies the equation of motion for the gauge elds, one must rst establish the fact that
these solutions exist in the rst place. to this end, the equivalence between (i) and (ii)
will prove to be extremely useful; magnetic monopoles and dyons can be understood in (ii)
in the language of brane congurations. masses, charges, and supersymmetries of these
objects can be analyzed in the language of (ii). the fact that these objects stay in the
spectrum of the theory in the decoupling limit provides a strong evidence that objects with
the corresponding mass, charge, and supersymmetry exist in the ncsym. in the language of
(ii), it is also straightforward to argue for the existence and stability of exotic dyons which

1related 1/2-bps and 1/4-bps constant eld-strength solutions on tori were discussed in [8, 9, 10].

this paper is organized as follows. we will begin in section 2 by briey reviewing some
basic facts about the ncsym (i) and how they arise as a decoupling limit. then we will
take the magnetic monopole as a concrete example and study its static properties in the
language of (ii) in section 3. in section 4, we will describe how the analysis of section 3 can
be generalized to (p, q)-dyons and string junctions. we will conclude in section 5.

2 non-commutative yang-mills from string theory

in this section, we will review the string theory origin of the ncsym. to be specic, let
us take our space-time to have 3+1 dimensions. we will not consider the eect of making
time non-commutative. then, without loss of generality, we can restrict our attention to
the case where the only non-vanishing component of the non-commutativity parameter is
223 =  1

232 = 2. ( has the dimension of length.) the ncsym with coupling gym and

relevant details about non-commutative geometry and the ncsym are reviewed in [1, 3].

according to the construction of [1], this theory is equivalent to d3-branes in the back-

ground nsns 2-form in the   0 limit while scaling

in the presence of d-branes, longitudinally polarized
constant nsns 2-form is not a pure gauge and has the eect of inducing a magnetic ux
on the world volume. the magnetic uxes in this context can be interpreted as the non-
threshold bound state of d-strings oriented along the 1-direction. when multiple parallel
d3-branes are present, the same number of d-strings get induced on each of the d3-branes.

when the 23-directions is compactied on a torus of size b = /2, the ratio of the
number of induced d-strings and the number of d3-branes is precisely n1/n3 = 2/2.

the map between gauge elds a of the ncsym (i) and the gauge elds a living on
the d1-d3 bound state (ii) was constructed in [3] to leading non-trivial order in , and
takes the form

the resummation of this series is not well understood at the present time2.

3 magnetic monopoles in ncsym

in this paper, we will study a variety of dyonic states in the ncsym. it will however be
convenient to rst study the case of the bps monopole as a prototype. the analysis for
other cases will follow a similar pattern.

3.1 basic notions of the ncsym monopoles

we are interested in studying the properties of the monopole-like objects in the ncsym (i).
to simplify our discussions, we will take our gauge group to be su(2). some basic properties
of the ncsym action is already manifest. first, the -product acts like an ordinary product
for the constant elds in the cartan subalgebra of the gauge group. therefore, ncsym can
be higgsed just like the ordinary sym. this is important since bps monopoles exist as a
stable state in the higgsed sym. second, if we assume that only the magnetic eld and one
component of the scalar (say 9) is non-zero, the terms in the action can be assembled into
the form

s =

1
4g2

ym

trz dx4hijk(cid:16) fij  dk  + dk   fij(cid:17) + ( fij  ij

kdk )  ( f ij  ijkdk )i .

(3.1)

the second term in the integral is positive denite, so the action is bounded below by

s 

1
4g2

ym

trz dx4 ijk(cid:16) fij  dk  + dk   fij(cid:17) =

1
2g2

ym

trz dx4 kijk(cid:16) fij  (cid:17) .

(3.2)

thus the notion of the bps bound exists also in the non-commutative theory.

now, by denition, a magnetic monopole solution should have the property that

at large r, so the bound on the action can be made to take the form

s =

dsk ijk fij3.

furthermore, in order for the action to be nite, fij should decay according to

bk =

(3.5)

at suciently large r where the system looks spherically symmetric. therefore, (3.4) is
evaluated as

s =

u.

(3.6)

2q
g2
ym

in commutative theories, q takes on integer values due to the diracs quantization condition.
it is an important question whether there are corrections to q in powers of (u) for the
non-commutative theory. even in the non-commutative theory, however, the elds are slowly
varying for large enough r, so we expect the standard commutative gauge invariance argu-
ment to hold. therefore, we are lead to conclude that the magnetic monopoles of ncsym
have the same masses and charges as their commutative counterparts.

here we have argued in general terms that a self-dual magnetic monopole solution will
saturate the bps bound and has the same mass and the charge as in the commutative the-
ory, provided that they exist. unfortunately, the eld equations of the non-commutative
theory contain an innite series of higher derivative interactions, making the task of prov-
ing the existence, as well as studying the detailed structure of these solutions, a serious
challenge. however, even without the detailed understanding of magnetic monopole solu-
tions in ncsym, the equivalence between (i) and (ii) can be exploited to establish some
basic properties of these objects. for example, the existence, the stability, the mass, and
the supersymmetry of these states can be understood in the language of brane construction
in (ii). in this formalism, it is also easy to establish similar properties of (p, q)-dyons and
string junctions. these brane constructions provide a strong evidence that the corresponding
objects exist in (i).

3.2 brane construction of the ncsym monopoles

in the formalism of the eld theory brane constructions, magnetic monopoles in higgsed sym
have a natural realization as d-strings suspended between a pair of parallel but separated
d3-branes. similar conguration exists in (ii) and is a natural candidate for a state which
gets mapped to the magnetic monopole of (i) under the relation (2.5). one important
dierence between (ii) and the usual situation is the fact that the background nsns 2-
form b23 also induces a background rr 2-form a01 = 1

which couples to the world

entation.

volume of the suspended d-string [5, 16]. this eect can also be interpreted as the force
felt by the magnetic charge at the endpoint of the suspended d-string in the background
of constant magnetic eld in the 1-direction. the overall eect is to tilt the suspended d-
string in the 1-direction and to change the overall energy of the conguration (see figure 1).
the extent of the tilt and the change in the energy can be found by obtaining the minimal
energy conguration of the d-string dbi action in the rr 2-form background at weak string
coupling

(3.8)

where we used (2.4) to express the result in terms of the parameters of the ncsym (i).
despite the fact that the suspended d-string was tilted in the 1-direction in response to the
background elds, the mass remained exactly the same as in the ordinary sym.

it is also interesting to compute the non-locality of the suspended d-string indicated

by  in figure 1:

dx9

u = 2u.

(3.9)

this length therefore remains constant in the decoupling limit   0 in spite of the fact
that the slope dx1/dx9 diverges in this limit.

it is straightforward to count the number of supersymmetries preserved by this congu-

ration. let us denote the spinors representing 32 supercharges of type iib theory by

 = l  r,

+ = l + r.

(3.10)

as we mentioned earlier, d3-branes in the background of b23 can be thought of as a bound
state of n1 d-strings and n3 d3-branes. such a conguration places a constraint

 = 01(sin() + 23 cos()+)

(3.11)

on the supercharges, where tan() = b. this result can be easily obtained by following the
supersymmetry of (p, q) = (n1, n3) string through a chain of duality transformations. on
the other hand, a d-string tilted in the 19-plane by the angle  = tan1(b) preserves

where

 = 0,

+ = 0+

 = 1 sin() + 9 cos().

(3.12)

(3.13)

the two constraints in (3.12) reduces the number of preserved supersymmetries from 32 to
16. it turns out that (3.11) closes among spinors satisfying (3.12), and reduce the number
of independent supersymmetries from 16 to 8. therefore, this brane conguration preserves
the same number of supersymmetries as the magnetic monopole of n = 4 sym.

we are interested in the supersymmetry of these states in the eld theory limit where
we scale b = 2/   keeping  xed. in this limit linear combinations of (3.11) and
(3.12) can be assembled into the following independent set of conditions

 = 01,
 = 9123+.

+ = 01+,

(3.14)

(3.15)

these conditions are satised by 8 spinor components, indicating that the magnetic monopole
preserves 8 out of 16 supercharges in the eld theory limit.

the brane conguration described in this section is precisely the s-dual of the congura-
tion considered in [17], except for the fact that in [17], it was the d3-brane that was tilted
instead of the d-string. the two description can be mapped from one to the other by simply
rotating the entire system. although rotating the branes seem like a trivial operation, it
amounts to changing the static gauge condition in the language of dbi action. the fact
that this makes implicit reference to the gravitational sector of the theory means that this

6

is not a symmetry in the eld theory limit. it is more like a duality transformation mapping
equivalent physical system between two descriptions. let us therefore refer to the tilted
d3-brane description as (iii).

one particular advantage of (iii) is the fact that the eld conguration corresponding
to this brane conguration is easily understood. thinking of the pair of d3-branes as giving
rise to u(2) = u(1)  su(2) gauge theory, the conguration of figure 2 is simply the f23 =
9 = b embedded into the u(1) sector and an ordinary prasad-sommereld monopole
embedded into the su(2) sector [18].

the equivalence between (ii) and (iii) also sheds light on the nature of (ii) when
expanded in . when (iii) is interpreted as a bion, the elds are well dened as a single
valued function. when (iii) is rotated to (ii), this single-valuedness is lost. the eld
conguration must now contain branch cuts to account for multi-valuedness in some region
of the d3-brane world volume. since such a eld conguration is non-analytic, expansion in
 is likely not to yield a uniformly converging series, and this may have profound implication
for the map between (i) and (ii). especially in light of the fact that (ii) seem pathological
from many points of view, having a more conventional alternative description (iii) may
prove to be extremely useful in future investigations.

3.3 magnetic monopoles at large n and large t hooft coupling

before concluding this section, let us pause for a moment and briey describe what happens
to the magnetic monopoles in the ncsym with large t hooft coupling and large n. consider
su(n + 1) broken to su(n)  u(1). at large coupling, this su(n) sector is described by
the supergravity background [4, 5] and the u(1) sector appears as a d3-brane probe in this
background. the supergravity background describing the near horizon of the n d3-branes
in the background of b23 is given by

ds2 = (  u 2

(3.17)

near the probe d3-brane, magnetic charge of the d-string will feel the same force as in the
case of the at space, so we impose the boundary condition that u = /2 at u where

we place the probe d3-brane. rather remarkably, the conguration

(3.18)

(3.19)

which, as expected for a bps state, is the same mass that we found in the weakly coupled
limit.

4 (p,q)-dyons and string junctions in ncsym

in the previous section, we described the interpretation of magnetic monopoles of the nc-
sym in the language of (ii) and found that they have the same mass as the ordinary
sym. it is extremely straightforward to repeat the analysis of the previous section to the
case of (p, q)-dyons. there will be some qualitative dierence in the pattern of supersym-
metry breaking which we will discuss below. once the basic properties of the (p, q)-dyons
are understood, it is natural to consider the possibility of forming a state corresponding
to a string-junction [11, 12, 13, 14]. we will examine the existence, the stability, and the
supersymmetry of these junction states.

4.1

(p,q)-dyons in ncsym

it is extremely straightforward to generalize the discussion of the previous section to the
(p, q)-dyon. the expression for the action (3.7) is generalized to

(4.3)

which is precisely identical to the result one would expect from the ordinary sym.

let us now investigate the number of preserved supersymmetries for these dyons. for
the sake of concreteness, we will rst consider (p, q) = (1, 0), which is a w-boson. as in the
previous section, the d3-brane puts the constraint (3.11). the (1, 0)-string, on the other
hand, preserves

for spinors satisfying (4.4), the supersymmetry constraint (3.11) simplies to

 = 09+.

(4.4)

(4.5)

(cid:16)1  01 sin()  1239 cos()(cid:17)  = 0.

conditions (4.4) and (4.5) are satised by 8 independent spinor components for arbitrary
values of .3 therefore, we learn that the w-boson in the eld theory limit tan() = b =
2/   also preserves 8 supercharges.

it is straight forward to extend this analysis to the case of (p, q) dyons. taking the (p, q)-
string to be oriented in the direction given by (4.2), it is easy to obtain a set of independent
constraints in a manner similar to the monopole in the last section. the number of the
unbroken supersymmetries is 8, and in the decoupling limit, the surviving supersymmetries
are specied by (3.14) in addition to the constraint

vuutp2 +  2q
ym!2

g2

9 = 1 p +

2q
g2
ym

23! +,

(4.6)

which reduces to (3.15) when (p, q) = (0, 1). we conclude that in the eld theory limit, the
(p, q)-dyons are 1/2 bps objects, precisely analogous to the situation in the ordinary n = 4
sym.

just as in the magnetic monopole case, one can consider the analogue of (iii) where one
tilts the d3-brane in such a way to make the (p, q)-string point upward. this will simply
correspond to embedding the julia-zee dyon in the su(2) sector and turning on the u(1)
part independently. from this standpoint, it is easy to see that the number of preserved
supersymmetries is 8.

the large n and large t hooft coupling limit of the (p, q)-dyon is also straightforward

to analyze. one simply generalizes (3.17) to

 z dx1(cid:18)qp2 + q2e2qg00(g11 + gu u (u(x1))2)  qa01(cid:19) .

4.2 string junctions in ncsym

having established the existence and some basic properties of (p, q)-dyons, it is natural to
consider the status of string junctions. in the absence of the background nsns 2-form, the
existence of string junction relied on the property of (p, q)-strings, that their tension can be
balanced

where

~tpi,qi = 0

xi
~tp,q =  p,

q

gs!

(4.10)

(4.11)

for p pi = p qi = 0. the components of ~t can be, say, in the 8 and the 9 directions.

when the eect of the b-eld is taken in to account, these vectors are rotated out of the
89-plane into the 1-direction. now one needs to make sure that the tension balance condition
is satised in the 1, 8, and 9 directions simultaneously. it turns out, however, that the entire
eect of the b-eld can be accounted for by rotating the tension vector in the 19-plane so
that the (1,8,9) components read

~tp,q =   q

gs

sin(), p,

q
gs

cos()! ,

tan() = b.

(4.12)

it is straightforward to verify that this vector is oriented relative to the d3-brane world
volume with the appropriate slope (4.2) by rotating tp,q in the 89-plane to point in the
19-directions.

since we can just as easily tilt the d3-branes instead of tilting the (p, q)-strings, there is a
version of (iii) for the string junction. the fact that the eld conguration for such a state
is known [19, 20, 21, 22] might prove useful in the same way that the prasad-sommereld
solution in (iii) is related to the magnetic monopole in the ncsym (i).

clearly, the condition for sum of ~tp,q to vanish for conserved (p, q)-charges in a string
junction is still valid, so the string junction exists as a stable state in the presence of the
b eld. though diferent supersymmetries are preserved by the respective component (p, q)-
strings in the string network, in view of this stability the whole conguration is expected to

19-plane in response to the nsns 2-form background.

preserve some of the supersymmetries. let us therefore investigate the eld theory limit of
these congurations more closely.

consider a junction of strings (pi, qi), i = 1, 2, 3, supported by d3-branes localized in
the 89-plane with strings meeting at the origin. in order to take the eld theory limit of
such a conguration, we should scale the distance of the d3-brane to the origin as ui with
  0 and oriented in the (p,
gs1+b2 ) direction in the 89-plane. in other words, the higgs
expectation value of the (8, 9) eld should be chosen to scale according to

(4.13)

to take the eld theory limit, we scale gs and b according to (2.4). expressed in terms of

and has a trivial   0 limit. these junction states therefore appear to exist in the eld
theory limit and orient itself in the usual way in the 89-plane as we illustrate in figure 3.
figure 3 does not represent the orientation of the strings outside the 89-plane but it should
be remembered that they are tilted in the 19-plane. the mass of the junction takes the same
form as in the commutative case

m = xi=1,2,3sp2

(4.15)

the unbroken supersymmetries of the junction in the eld theory limit corresponds to
the spinor components of the supercharges satisfying the constraints of both the monopoles
and the w-bosons, (3.14), (3.15), and (4.4). this can be seen easily from the fact that, since
the (pi, qi)-string is now oriented in the direction (4.14) in the 89-plane in the decoupling
limit, the constraint for the component (pi, qi)-string becomes

(4.16)

as a generalization of (4.6). we conclude, therefore, that objects in the ncsym correspond-
ing to the eld theory limit of the string junctions preserves 4 supercharges, just like their

the goal of this paper was to understand the static properties of the magnetic monopole
solution and its cousins in the ncsym. instead of working with the lagrangian formulation
of ncsym (i), we took advantage of the equivalence between ncsym (i) and the decou-
pling limit of d3-branes in a background nsns 2-form potential (ii) to study the stable
brane congurations corresponding to these states. using this approach, it is extremely easy
to show that there are stable brane congurations corresponding to magnetic monopoles,
(p, q)-dyons, and string junctions, and that they survive in the eld theory limit.

having established some basic properties of these objects in the language of brane
construction, it is natural to wonder how much of this can be understood strictly in the
frame work of the lagrangian formalism. it would be especially interesting to nd an ex-
plicit solution which generalizes the standard prasad-sommereld solution [23] to the non-
commutative setup. it is very encouraging that the construction of instanton solutions via
the adhm method admits a natural non-commutative generalization [7]. indeed, nahms
construction of the magnetic monopole [24, 25, 26] also admits a simple non-commutative
generalization. one simply solves for the normalized zero modes of the operator

0 =   v = i

d
dz

v(z, x)  x  v(z, x)  tv(z, x),

(5.1)

and computes

ai = z u/2

u/2

dz v(z, x)  iv(z, x),

 = z u/2

u/2

dz zv(z, x)  v(z, x).

(5.2)

the non-commutativity is reected in the -product in (5.1), and as long as    satises
the usual requirement that it be invertible and that it commutes with the quarternions, all

12

the steps in the argument leading to the self-duality of (5.2) follow immediately from the
same argument in the commutative case [27, 28]. despite tantalizing similarities with the
commutative case, we were not able to solve (5.1) in closed form to proceed further. it would
be very interesting to see if an explicit expression for the non-commutative bps monopole
can be found.
