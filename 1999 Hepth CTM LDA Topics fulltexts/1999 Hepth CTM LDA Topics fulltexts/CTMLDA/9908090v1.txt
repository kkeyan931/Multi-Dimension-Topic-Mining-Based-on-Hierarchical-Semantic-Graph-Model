we present a way of tiling the plane with a regular hexagonal network of defects. the network is
stable and follows in consequence of the three-junctions that appear in a model of two real scalar
elds that presents z3 symmetry. the z3 symmetry is eective in both the vacuum and defect
sectors, and no supersymmetry is required to build the network.

domain walls appear in diverse branchs of physics,
envolving energy scales as dierent as the ones for in-
stance in magnetic materials [1] and in cosmology [2].
they live in three spatial dimensions as bidimensional
objects that arise in systems with at least two isolated
degenerate minima. in eld theory they appear in the
(3, 1) dimensional space-time, and this may happen in
supersymmetric theories, although supersymmetry plays
no fundamental role for the presence of domain walls.

very recently, in a paper by gibbons and townsend
[3], and also in refs. [4,5], one investigates the presence
of domain walls and their possible intersections in a wess-
zumino model, with a polynomial superpotential. in the
supersymmetric theory, one can classify the classical solu-
tions as bps and non-bps states, according to the work
of bogomolnyi, and of prasad and sommereld [6]. the
bps states are stable, and are expected to play some
role in investigating duality in supersymmetric models.
we recall that no bps state can be annihilated under
continuum variation of the parameters that dene the
supersymmetric theory.

in ref. [7] one investigates models of coupled real scalar
elds in bidimensional space-time. these investigations
provide a concrete way of nding bps states and suggest
other studies, in particular on the subject of defects inside
defects  see ref. [8]. most of the models investigated in
[7,8] can be seen as real bosonic portions of supersym-
metric theories. in supersymmetric models the presence
of discrete symmetry may produce bps and non-bps
defects. the bps states lie in shorter multiplets, and
preserve the supersymmetry only partially [9,10]. there
are bps states that preserve 1/2 of the supersymmetry,
but the possibility of bps states preserving 1/4 super-
symmetry is subtler, and is shown to appear as junctions
[12,11] of domain walls in the recent papers [35].

in the present work we start dealing with the bosonic
portions of supersymmetric theories. we do this guided
by the discrete z3 symmetry, with the aim of describing
the presence of three-junctions and the network of defects
that it can generate. we rst point out that supersymme-
try introduces restrictions that may lead to instability of
the junction, or at least of the network that it could gen-
erate. we then examine another model, and show that
all the diculties found in the supersymmetric context
are circumvented by just giving up supersymmetry.

where w = w (, ) is the superpotential.

the superpotential allows introducing several proper-
ties, as shown in refs. [7,8]. for instance, for static elds
the equations of motion are solved by rst-order dier-
ential equations

(4)

the energy of solutions of the rst-order equations are
given by e(i,j)
b = |w(i,j)|, with w(i,j) = wi  wj and
wi = w (i, i), where (i, i) represents the i-th vac-
uum state of the model. this is the bogomolnyi bound,
and the corresponding solutions are bps solutions. the
bps solutions are linearly or classically stable.

we guide ourselves toward the topological solutions by

introducing the topological current

j  = (cid:18)
(cid:19)

(5)

it obeys j  = 0, and it is also a vector in the (, )
plane. for static congurations we have j t
 j  = t ,
where  = (, ) is the charge density. this charge den-
sity allows writing t as twice the kinetic energy density
of the topological solution, and this can be used to infer
stability of junctions  see below.

let us now consider a specic model, dened by the

superpotential [13]

thus, it behaves standardly in one, two, and three spatial
dimensions.

the above potential presents the three vacuum states

(0,p4/3), (1,p1/3), and (1,p1/3). these min-

ima form an equilateral triangle invariant under the z3
rotations, with side l = 2. the values of the super-
potential at the minima are w1 = , w2 = 2  and
w3 = 2. the energies of the bps states are ||, 3 ||,
and 4 ||. all the three sectors are bps sectors, but they
do not present the z3 symmetry that connects the vac-
uum states. the highest energy is associated to the sector
connecting the second and third vacuum states. this is
the only sector where we can nd explicit solutions. they

are given by (x) =  tanh(3 x) and (x) = p1/3 .

this is a bps state, representing an orbit in the (, )
plane. the orbit is a straight-line segment that connects
the corresponding vacuum states. the orbits connecting
the other vacua cannot be straight-line segments. they
cannot be obtained by rotating the (, ) plane accord-
ing to the z3 symmetry, and so the defect sectors do
not present the z3 symmetry that connects the vacuum
states. this fact also appears when one identies the
tensions of the bps defects. they are given by t1 = ||,
t2 = 3 ||, and t3 = 4 ||. they are dierent and do not
obey the z3 symmetry. they are such that t3 = t1 + t2,
and do not strictly obey the triangular inequality one
needs to ensure stability [12] of the three-junction that
appears in this model.

to circumvent instability of the three-junction we now
follow refs. [3,4]. we make contact with these works after
considering superpotentials that satisfy w + w = 0.
in this case, for harmonic superpotentials one adds to
the two rst-order equations (3) and (4) the two new
rst-order equations [13]

solutions to these equations also minimize the energy
and solve the equations of motion. this allows introduc-

ing fw (, ) such that fw = w and fw = w. we
use w and fw to introduce the complex superpotential,
w = w + ifw . we write the complex superpotential in

terms of the complex eld  + i, and this is the way one
gets from the investigations of refs. [7,8] to the recent
possibility [35] of describing three-junctions preserving
1/4 supersymmetry. however, junctions require the pres-
ence of at least three minima, and this is only achieved
when the superpotential is of at least the fourth-order
power in the complex eld. this means that the model
behaves standardly only in one and two spatial dimen-
sions. in this case one can show explicitly [3,4] that the
three-junction is stable and breaks 1/4 supersymmetry,
although supersymmetry itself does not allow the pres-
ence of a stable network of defects [35]. owing to the
fact that each adjacent junction in the network has oppo-
site winding number, any adjacent vacua should be con-
nected with defect solutions also having opposite winding
numbers along the same orbit [5]. since we have to use
dierent conjugate bogomolnyi equations to take into
account these winding numbers, the network cleary can-
not be bps and then can decay.

we then give up supersymmetry, turning our attention
to polynomial potentials that engenders the z3 symme-
try, and that supports stable three-junctions that gener-
ate a regular hexagonal network of defects. interestingly,
we have found a fourth-order polynomial potential that
do the job. it is given by

the potential has three degenerate minima, at the points

dx2 = 2(cid:18)42 + 42 + 6  
v1 = (3/2) (1, 0) and v2,3 = (3/4) (1,3). these min-
ima form an equilateral triangle, invariant under the z3
symmetry. the distance between the minima is (3/2)3.
we can obtain the topological solutions explicitly. the
easiest way to do this follows by rst examining the sector
that connects the vacua v2 and v3. this is so because in
this case we set  = 3/4, searching for a strainght-line
segment in the (, ) plane. this is compatible with the
eq. (13), and reduces the other eq. (14) to the form

dx2 = 2(cid:18)43

this implies that the orbit connecting the vacua v2 and
v3 is a straight line. it is such that, along the orbit the
 eld feels the potential 2 [2  (27/16)]2. this shows
that the model reduces to a model of a single eld, and
the solution satises the rst-order equation

the solutions have the same energy, (27/16)p3/2||.

the label () is used to identify kink and antikink. all
we examine how the bosonic elds behave in the back-
ground of the classical solutions. we do this by consid-
ering uctuations around the static solutions (x) and
(x). we use the equations of motion to see that the
uctuations depend on the potential

v v(cid:19)
u(x) =(cid:18)v v

(24)

evidently, after obtaining the derivatives we substitute
the elds by their classical static values (x) and (x).
the model under consideration is dened by the potential
(12).
in this case we use (18) and (19) to obtain two
decoupled equations for the uctuations. the potentials
of the corresponding schrodinger-like equations are

0 = 0 and w

the eigenvalues can be obtained explicitly: in the  di-
rection we get w
the  direction we have w
that the pair (18) and (19) is stable, and by symmetry
we get that all the three topological solutions are stable
solutions.

1 = (9/2)p2/2, and in
0 = (9/2)p2/2. this shows

the classical solutions present the nice property of hav-
ing energy evenly distributed in their kinetic (k) and po-
tential (p) portions. in terms of energy density they are

k(x) = p(x) =

(27)

to understand this feature we recall the calculation done
explicitly in the sector with  = 3/4, constant. there
the model is shown to reduce to a model of a single eld, a
model that supports bps solutions. within this context,
the above solutions are very much like the non-bps so-
lutions that appear in supersymmetric systems [13]. we
use this property and the topological current (5) to ob-
tain t = , where (x) = k(x) + p(x) is the (total)
energy density of the solution. we use this result and
the notation (i, j), to identify the sector connecting the
vacua (i, i) and (j , j), to show that for any two dif-
ferent sectors (i, j) and (i, k), i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 we get that
((i,j) + (i,k))t ((i,j) + (i,k)) < t
(i,k)(i,k).
this is the condition for stability of junctions in the
present model. this result is more general than the one
in ref. [12], which appears within the context of super-
symmetry. evidently, our result also works for bps and
non-bps solutions that appears in supersymmetric mod-
els, with the property of having energy evenly distributed
in their kinetic and potential portions [13].

(i,j)(i,j) + t

we notice that the orbits corresponding to the stable
defect solutions form an equilateral triangle in the (, )
plane. this is so because the solutions are straight-line
segments joining the three vacuum states in conguration
space. they are degenerate in energy, and this allows
associating to each defect the same tension

t =

27

16r 3

2 ||

(28)

this makes ti < tj + tk, i, j, k = 1, 2, 3, and now the tri-
angular inequality is strictly valid in this case, stabilizing
the three-junction that appears in this model when one
enlarges the space-time to three spatial dimensions.

we consider the possibility of junctions in the plane,
which may give rise to a planar network of defects. we
work in the (2, 1) space-time, in the plane (x, y). we
identify the plane (x, y) with the space of congurations,

3

the plane (, ). we illustrate this situation by consider-
ing, for instance, the solutions we have already obtained.
they are collected in eqs. (18)-(23) in (1,1) dimensions.

these are the planar defects one needs to tile the plane
with a network of defects.

the three-junction that appears in this z3-symmetric
model allows building a network of defects, precisely in
the form of a regular hexagonal network, as depicted in
fig. 1.
in this network the tension associated to the
defect is given by eq. (28) and the tipical length of the
hexagon is (3/2)3.

in the network, each side of the hexagon carries the

energy (35/27)2 ||, where we have taken into account

the fact that in the hexagonal network each side belongs
to two hexagonal cells. we divide this value by the area
of the hexagonal cell to get the planar energy density

(35)

this is the tipical value of the energy density, in this tiling
of the plane with a regular hexagonal network, which
seems to be the most ecient way of tiling the plane. as
we have shown, our model behaves standardly in (3, 1)
dimensions. it supports stable three-junctions that gen-
erate a stable regular hexagonal network of defects.
