abstract

we consider instanton contributions to chiral correlators, such as h0|tr2(x)tr2(x)|0i,
in n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills theory with either light adjoint or fundamental
matter. within the former model, extraction of the gluino condensate from a connected
1-instanton diagram, evaluated at strong coupling, can be contrasted with expectations
from the seiberg-witten solution perturbed to an n= 1 vacuum. we observe a numer-
ical discrepancy, coinciding with that observed previously in n = 1 sqcd. moreover,
since knowledge of the vacuum structure is complete for softly broken n = 2 yang-
mills, this model serves as a counterexample to the hypothesis of amati et al. that
1-instanton calculations at strong coupling can be interpreted as averaging over vacua.
within n= 1 sqcd, we point out that the connected contribution to the relevant cor-
relators actually vanishes in the weakly coupled higgs phase, despite having a nonzero
value through infra-red eects when calculated in the unbroken phase.

1 introduction

historically, the rst arena in which supersymmetry and nonperturbative instanton
eects were successfully integrated was in the direct calculation of certain chiral cor-
relators [1]. these correlators involve the lowest components of chiral superelds, and
a well-known example in n = 1 supersymmetric yang-mills (sym) with gauge group
su(2) is the 2-point function of gluino bilinears h0|tr 2(x) tr 2(x)|0i. chirality en-
sures that there can be no contribution at any order in perturbation theory, while at
rst sight it is also highly nontrivial that instantons can lead to a nonzero result with-
out breaking supersymmetry. that they do, reects one of the profound features of
supersymmetric gauge dynamics, in that such correlators are essentially topological. in
at space, supersymmetry demands that they be spacetime independent constants [1],
while more generally, when evaluated in nontrivial geometries, they are independent
of the background metric, and reect only specic topological features of the back-
ground [2]. this was made particularly clear by wittens subsequent construction of
topological eld theories [3].

the qualitative picture for instanton generation of these chiral correlators, and the
associated superpotentials, has been clear for some time. however, the issue of the
precise numerical coecients has been rather more controversial. during the eighties,
two dierent techniques for instanton calculations in this context were developed. the
strong-coupling instanton (sci) approach [1, 4, 5, 6] (see [7] for a review), applies in
strongly coupled theories such as n = 1 sym where the instanton is an exact solution
to the equations of motion, and involves a direct integration over the instanton zero
modes. for a given correlator, only a given instanton order can contribute, and the
integration over instanton size  is peaked at   |x x|. since the result is spacetime
independent as a consequence of supersymmetry, by taking |x  x|  0 one expects
the calculation to be well dened, and thus the result appears, mathematically at least,
to be exact. the loophole is that although small size instantons are under control,
there is no guarantee that additional uctuations at some larger scale, e.g.   ,
cannot contribute.

an additional puzzle concerns cluster decomposition. at large distances |xx|  
one expects the result to factorise. returning to the su(2) example, we expect
h0|tr 2(x) tr 2(x)|0i = h0|tr 2|0i2, implying a nonzero gluino condensate. the dou-
ble valued nature of h0|tr 2|0i is consistent with the witten index [8] for this theory,
but the puzzle lies in the fact that instantons cannot contribute to h0|tr 2|0i directly
as tr 2 can only saturate two of four fermionic zero modes. thus in the instanton
approximation h0|tr 2|0i = 0, and one apparently has a violation of cluster decomposi-
tion. a possible resolution to this puzzle, known as the vacuum averaging hypothesis
was proposed by amati et al.
[7], within which the sci calculation reects an aver-
age over the vacua of the theory. this nicely explains why h0|tr 2(x) tr 2(x)|0i for
example is nonzero, while a direct instanton calculation of h0|tr 2|0i at strong cou-
pling necessarily vanishes, since (for gauge group su(2)) one obtains contributions of
opposite sign from the two chirally asymmetric vacua.

1

the second approach to instanton calculations, known as the weak-coupling instan-
ton (wci) technique [9, 10] (for a recent review, see [11]), rst makes use of additional
fundamental matter elds to put the system at weak coupling where the instanton cal-
culation should indeed be reliable. the wci calculation produces a gluino condensate

with a square-root dependence on the mass m of the matter elds, htr2i  m.

the important feature, proven in [12], is that the mass dependence observed at weak
coupling is exact. the proof is based on supersymmetric ward identities [4] which
demand that htr2i be a holomorphic function of m, i.e.  htr2i/m = 0, and on the
relation  htr2i/m = htr2i/2m. therefore we can then take the limit m   to
return to strong coupling and compare directly with the sci calculation.

comparison of the sci and wci results at strong coupling leads to a well-known

numerical discrepancy,

d0| tr 2 |0e2

sc

=

4

5 d0| tr 2 |0e2

wc

.

(1)

note that in contrast to the suggestion of vacuum averaging within the sci calculation,
the wci calculation necessarily reects the contribution from a single vacuum, as one
analytically continues from weak coupling where the vacuum state is unambiguous.
however, if we assume that this model has two chirally asymmetric vacua, as implied
by the witten index [8], these contribute equally to h0|tr 2|0i2
sc and thus the factor
of 4/5 in (1) represents an incompatibility, the origin of which has been the source of
some debate over the last ten years.

the wci calculations have the advantage that they are performed at weak coupling
where the relevant contributions are well understood. furthermore, the constraints of
holomorphy have since been used by seiberg to unearth a wealth of nonperturbative
information about n= 1 gauge theories [13], and similar tools were also used by seiberg
and witten in the context of n= 2 sym [14]. given these successes of the general weak
coupling approach, suspicion naturally falls rst on the strong coupling calculation and
it is of interest to know whether the discrepancy in (1) has any physical content. in this
regard, the vacuum averaging hypothesis has been utilised by kovner and shifman [15],
who suggested that the numerical discrepancy in (1) could be explained in this way
within pure n= 1 sym by assuming the existence of an additional chirally symmetric
vacuum, where h0|tr 2|0i = 0. such a vacuum must have rather unusual properties
and there has been considerable debate as to its feasibility [16].

in this paper, we are not concerned with the chirally symmetric vacuum specically,
but in the underlying vacuum-averaging hypothesis, and consequently on the inter-
pretation of the sci calculation itself. our main point will be that there is a clear
counter-example to this hypothesis, namely n = 1 sym with light adjoint matter (or
in other words softly broken n = 2 sym). the additional insight necessary to make
this conclusion arises by perturbing the seiberg-witten solution [14], so that the ex-
act n = 1 vacuum structure may be deduced. as is well-known, one nds only two
chirally asymmetric vacua. this result will be briey reviewed in section 2. knowl-
edge of these vacua allows a simple deduction of the gluino condensate via use of the
konishi anomaly [17]. for comparison, we then consider the direct sci calculation

2

of h0|tr 2(x) tr 2(x)|0isc in this model, nding exactly the same numerical discrep-
ancy as in eq. (1). this failure of vacuum averaging leaves the interpretation of the
sci calculation rather unclear. we discuss this issue in relation to the known quantum
corrections to the n= 2 moduli space in section 3.

we turn in section 4 to n = 1 sqcd, i.e. involving light fundamental matter, and
review several aspects of the wci and sci calculations. in this case we have greater
control over the wci calculation, for the correlator h0|tr 2(x) 2(x)|0i (where  is
a squark modulus) in particular, and we show how factorisation occurs naturally at
weak coupling, where the sci result (which is a connected diagram) actually gives
no contribution. we also revisit an additional inconsistency (and a suggested resolu-
tion) of the sci calculation which arises at 1-instanton order, in that the numerical
discrepancy between the sci and wci calculations for h0|tr 2(x) tr 2(x)|0i and
h0|tr 2(x) 2(x)|0i actually diers, violating the konishi relation [17].

in regard to inconsistencies of the sci calculation in n= 1 sqcd, we note that recent
work on correlators saturated at strong coupling by multi-instanton congurations [18]
has suggested that cluster-decomposition may not hold within the sci approach. we
briey comment on the distinction between these results and 1-instanton eects at the
end of section 4. finally, we conclude in section 5 with some additional remarks on
the interpretation of the strong coupling calculation.

2 exact vacuum structure vs sci calculations

in this section we shall present two dierent calculations of the gluino condensate
within softly broken n = 2 sym, one from the seiberg-witten solution of the n = 2
theory, and the other from a direct sci calculation. we nd a discrepancy advertised
in the previous section, which we shall elaborate on in section 3.

in terms of n= 1 multiplets, softly broken n= 2 sym possesses one vector, and one
adjoint chiral multiplet, the latter having mass m  , where  is the dynamical scale
in n= 2 sym. throughout we shall take the gauge group to be su(2). the gluino 
is the lowest component of the eld strength w of the real vector supereld v , while
we shall denote the lowest component of the adjoint chiral supereld , by .

the gluino condensate, on which we will focus, is related to condensates of scalar
elds by the konishi anomaly [17]. this anomaly is expressed in terms of the following
operator relation

2

z d

( ev ) = 4

w()



+

tr
22 tr w 2 ,

(2)

where w() is the n = 1 superpotential, r denotes the representation of , and the
group factors for su(2) are tfund = 1/2, tad = 2. z is the bare eld normalisation
factor, and note that summation over the colour components of  is implied. an
average of the left-hand side of this equation over a supersymmetric vacuum vanishes

3

leading to the following relation for the gluino condensate,

d0| tr 2 |0e =

82

tr *0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

in particular, when  is in the adjoint representation of su(2), it is natural to choose
an n = 2 normalisation for  so that z = 1/g2
0 at the regulator scale. if we consider
a particular quadratic superpotential w() of the form,

which gives a bare mass

w() = mtr 2 ,

m =

to the eld , then the relation (3) reduces to

d0| tr 2 |0e = 82m d0| tr 2 |0e .

(4)

(5)

(6)

knowledge of the gluino condensate thus boils down to knowledge of the vacuum

state in terms of h0|tr 2|0i.

2.1 exact vacuum structure

before reviewing the vacuum structure which emerges quantum mechanically from the
seiberg-witten solution, it is convenient rst to recall the classical moduli space of
n= 2 sym. this space has two components,

mcl = ma=0 + ma6=0,

(7)

where a, which we identify with the scalar vev, h0||0i = a 3/2, parametrises the
moduli space. the rst component, ma=0, is simply a point a = 0 where the gauge
group g = su(2) remains unbroken. the second component, ma6=0, arises for a
generic vev for  which breaks the gauge group from g = su(2) to h = u(1), and
is given by ma6=0 = (c)3/(g/h)c, where (g/h)c denotes the complexication of the
coset, as is familiar in supersymmetric gauge theories. this manifold is simply c,
the complex plane with the origin removed, conveniently parametrised by a 6= 0. the
point to emphasise here is that mcl is actually two manifolds, the point ma=0 which,
as we shall discuss is associated with sci calculations, is distinguished by the triviality
of its gauge orbit.

turning to the quantum theory, we can focus on the low energy eective action asso-
ciated, for a generic scalar vev a, with the unbroken u(1). the light elds are described
by an n= 2 u(1) vector supereld a which contains the light multiplet associated with
the modulus a. the action is determined by the holomorphic prepotential f (a), and
in terms of n= 1 superelds the coecient of the u(1) gauge kinetic term w 2 is given

4

by  (a)  f (a), while the kahler potential for the adjoint chiral elds determines
the moduli space metric ds2 = gaa|da|2, as gaa = im  /(4). classically,

cl =

4i
g2

(8)

is constant, and the metric is at. however, quantum mechanically, the metric receives
a 1-loop perturbative correction, and an innite series of instanton corrections [19, 14].

while the vev a is a convenient coordinate for the classical moduli space, (and indeed
can be given a gauge invariant meaning in terms of the w boson mass as we shall
discuss later), the natural gauge invariant modulus is given by

h0| tr 2 |0i = u .

(9)

the moduli u and a are not independent, of course. while classically u = a2/2 and
thus (up to weyl reections) each gives an equivalent parametrisation of the classical
moduli space, quantum mechanically the seiberg-witten solution [14] determines a
more complex functional dependence and implies that only u is a good global coordinate
on the moduli space.

we have focussed on the n = 2 moduli space geometry, since on perturbing the
system with a mass term for the adjoint chiral eld given by eq. (4), it is essentially
this geometry which determines the scalar potential, v . using the denition (9) we
see that in the eective low energy theory the perturbation (4) is realised in the form

and thus the scalar potential is given by the reparametrisation invariant expression,

we = m u

(10)

v = | zwe |2

gzz

= | m zu |2

gzz

.

the natural choice z = u for the modulus leads to
v = | m|2guu ,

(11)

(12)

which exhibits the supersymmetric vacua as the singular points where the inverse
metric guu vanishes. classically, guu  |u|, i.e.
the mass perturbation leads to a
single vacuum state at ucl = 0, corresponding to the point ma=0 in the n = 2 moduli
space.

quantum mechanically, the seiberg-witten solution shows that guu vanishes at two

points 1,

u =  2 ,

(13)
which dene two n= 1 vacua. the dynamical scale  is dened here using pauli-villars
regularisation [20] as
(14)
1it is interesting that at these singular points, the metric gaa also vanishes, i.e. v  guu  gaa.

pv exp (2icl) .

4 = 4 m 4

5

note that at u = , which is the third singular point in the seiberg-witten solution,
the metric guu does not vanish, instead it diverges.

to understand the appearance of singularities of the metric at the specic points
given in (13), recall that the low energy n= 2 dynamics is encoded in an elliptic curve
bered over the u-plane [14],

y2 = p (x, u) , p (x, u) = (x  2)(x + 2)(x  u) .

(15)

the points at which cycles of the torus can degenerate are zeros of the discriminant,

 = 2(u2  4) .

(16)

we can see that these zeros determine the n = 1 vacua as follows: after perturbing
with the superpotential (10) let us impose the constraint (15) via a lagrange multiplier
 as an addition to the superpotential, we =  [y2  p (x, u)]. one then nds that
for m 6= 0 the f -atness conditions are equivalent to the requirements: p = 0, and
xp = 0. the appearance of the second order zeros in p (x) is equivalent to the
vanishing of the discriminant (15). thus the n = 1 vacua where v = 0 are given by
the locus of points where the torus (15) degenerates. we shall see another reection of
this in the form of the scalar potential below.

given the values in (13) for the modulus u at the n = 1 vacua we obtain, by use of

the konishi anomaly in the form of eq. (6), the gluino condensate as,

h0|tr 2|0isw =  8 2m 2 .

(17)

note that although we have obtained this result for small m  , it holds for arbitrary
m due to holomorphy. the proof follows in analogy with that in n = 1 sqcd [12].
we also note that this result may be derived without reference to the konishi anomaly
by elevating the coupling  to a spurion supereld, the highest component of which
then acts as a source for tr2 (see e.g. [21, 18]).

we have emphasised the role of singularities of the metric in xing the n = 1 vacua
and thus the gluino condensate (17). at nite m this approach breaks down in the
vicinity ( m/) of the singularities and, as we will discuss in section 3, the metric
is smooth in this region. however, the superpotential is then modied to include the
contribution of the gluino condensate, we = h0|tr2|0i/82 + mu. this modied
superpotential leads to vacua at the same points (13) as can be veried, in particular,
by the integrating in procedure [22]. the result is thus self-consistent.

the sign ambiguity of the gluino condensate in (17) reects the z2 remnant of the
anomalous u(1)r symmetry. it is worth noting that this z2 symmetry suggests that,
provided the potential is smooth near u = 0, the rst derivative must also vanish at
this point, and it might be a meta-stable symmetric vacuum. this is not the case as
may be determined by evaluating the potential (11) explicitly in terms of a complete
elliptic integral k(k),

v =

4 3 |m |2

|k|2 re(cid:16)k(k ) k(k)(cid:17)

,

6

(18)

where k2 = 22/(2 + u), and (k)2 = 1  k2. the potential is nonzero at u = 0
and actually possesses a saddle point, which is a local maximum in re u and a local
minimum in im u.

another side remark is that the scalar potential (18) is determined by periods of the
curve (15). to see this, recall that the modular parameter  for the torus (15) is a ratio
of the two periods,  = 1/2, and these periods are given by 1 = uf (a) = ikk(k)/
and 2 = ua = kk(k)/. from (18), one observes that the potential is determined by
the product im (12), and the n= 1 vacua are given by the points where either the real
or imaginary parts of the periods diverge in such a way that im   0, reecting the
degeneration of one of the cycles of the elliptic curve (15) as discussed above. we will
discuss the physical interpretation of the scalar potential v in more detail in section 3.

2.2 strong coupling instanton calculations

we shall now compare the result (17) obtained from the seiberg-witten solution with a
1-instanton calculation using the sci approach. note that this calculation is performed
at the classical vacuum, a = 0, which is the unique su(2) point in the n = 2 moduli
space. calculations with adjoint matter elds have previously been considered in [5].

the calculation proceeds in a manner very similar to that in pure n= 1 sym, and we
use the conventions of [11], to which the reader is referred for more details. in the pure
n= 1 case, the instanton possesses four fermionic zero modes associated with , which
saturate the chiral correlator h0|tr 2(x) tr 2(x)|0i. the result for this correlator is
given by

h0|tr 2(x) tr 2(x)|0in=1 sym =

exp(2icl).

when we add adjoint matter, there are additionally four fermionic zero modes for 
(the superpartner of ). the relevant diagram is given in fig. 1. due to the mass

,

(20)

where m is the bare mass dened in (5). then, it is enough to multiply eq. (19) by
the factor (20) to get the result:

h0|tr 2(x) tr 2(x)|0isc =

28
5

4m24.

(21)

this calculation is explicitly performed at a = 0, which is the classical vacuum
in the presence of the mass perturbation, and we nd that the result is a spacetime
independent constant, as required by supersymmetry. it is also important to note that
multi-instantons cannot contribute, since with a = 0 they will not lead to the correct
m24 dependence.

since the result (21) is a constant, if we assume cluster-decomposition, we nd on

comparison with (17) a result for the gluino condensate satisfying,

d0| tr 2 |0e2

sc

=

4

5 d0| tr 2 |0e2

,

(22)

as advertised in section 1. the factor 4/5 matches the discrepancy (1) observed within
instanton calculations in n = 1 sqcd. however, in contrast with the latter theories,
we have in this case knowledge of the exact vacuum structure, and can verify that this
numerical discrepancy cannot be explained by vacuum-averaging, which is the primary
result of this paper.
in particular, there are only two chirally asymmetric vacuum
states (13), each contributing equally to h0|tr 2|0i2 according to eq. (17).

3 sci calculations and the n = 2 moduli space

given the discrepancy between the sci calculation and the seiberg-witten solution
uncovered in the last section, it is natural to seek an explanation using knowledge of the
exact vacuum structure. indeed, its clear that the sci calculation is performed in the
su(2) phase which, while classically the vacuum state, is lifted quantum mechanically.
since this lifting already occurs at the unperturbed level of n = 2 sym, where only
the u(1) phase on coulomb branch is realised, we can search for an explanation within
this context.

the su(2) phase requires the presence of a massless multiplet associated with the
w  bosons (occurring classically at a = 0). quantum mechanically these states are
not present within the strong coupling region of the moduli space, while the point
a = 0  where the sci calculation is performed2  is not present. thus we suggest
2instanton calculations have veried the identication of a with h0||0i up to 2-instanton order

8

that it is the discontinuity of the spectrum across the curve of marginal stability which
is ultimately responsible for the failure of the sci calculation in this model. in this
section we shall comment on various aspects which lead to this conclusion.

the scalar potential

it is worth recalling that in n= 1 sqcd with one massive avour, quantum correc-
tions to the vacuum structure appear at rst sight somewhat similar to those in softly
broken n= 2 sym. in particular, the unique classical vacuum a = 0 corresponds to the
su(2) phase, while a 1-instanton eect generates an innite superpotential (see sec-
tion 4) at this point, resolving the classical vacuum state to two quantum vacua. thus
removal of the su(2) phase is associated with the generation of an innite potential at
this point.

we shall see shortly that there are important distinctions between this scenario
and softly broken n = 2. nonetheless, we can proceed by analogy in considering the
leading perturbative correction to the scalar potential v . this arises directly from the
analogous correction to the moduli space metric, and has the form,

v = 42|m|2

4!! ,

(23)

|a|2

ln|8a2/2|  1 + o (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)



a(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

importantly, this potential ex-

where instantons provide the power-like corrections.

hibits a singularity at the landau pole, beyond which, |a|  |/22|, it breaks down.
this singularity separates the vacuum point a = 0 from the region |a|  || in which
the potential is physically meaningful. this presents us with a heuristic picture for the
removal of a = 0 from the physical moduli space. however, this singular behaviour
can only be taken as a clue to what happens quantum mechanically at a  , since
instanton corrections are numerically large in this regime, and manifestly singular at
a = 0, reecting an induced tube-like behaviour of the metric inside the region
|a|  |/22|. nonetheless, we point out that the singular curve |a| = |/22| is

dieomorphic to, and not too far from, the quantum mechanical curve of marginal
stability for states such as the w  bosons.

before exploring this point in more detail, we should emphasise that this picture is
at best heuristic even including the instanton corrections to (23). in particular, if we
consider the behaviour of v near the vacuum u = 2 in terms of the appropriate small
variable ad = f (a)  , we nd a logarithmic singularity,

v = 82

|m |2
ln|8/ad|

+    .

(24)

of course, this singularity simply reects a breakdown of the eective theory due to
the presence of additional massless states (monopoles in this case). therefore, as noted

in the weak coupling regime [20, 23, 24]. furthermore, a gauge invariant denition of a is given by
the (complex) mass of w boson supermultiplet, whose vanishing would imply restoration of su(2).
however, this is clearly true only where w  bosons exist. while a may be analytically continued into
the strong coupling region, it then has little to do with the su(2) phase.

earlier, although appropriate for locating the vacua, the potential we have been using
is only valid outside a small region of the singularity of size o(m/). as is well known,

adding the additional light monopole (or dyon) states, we = 2 m adm, results in
smooth vacua where these elds condense (see e.g. [25, 26, 27] for explicit studies of the
potential in this case). note that the breaking scales for z4  z2 (the discrete remnant
of u(1)r), and connement, are then related: h0|tr 2|0i = 42i2h0|m m|0i.

the curve of marginal stability

as discussed above, the leading perturbative correction to the potential (23) is sin-
gular near the curve of marginal stability. since the vacuum state at a = 0 lies within
the singular curve, this suggests that the lifting of the su(2) phase may be associated,
not with a potential barrier as in n = 1 sqcd, but with the marginal stability of the
w  boson states on this curve. this is the point of view we shall now explore.

we begin by recalling that the classical singular point at ucl = a2/2 = 0 is degenerate
in the sense that w  bosons and monopoles both become light in the vicinity of this
point. quantum mechanically, this singularity is resolved to the curve of marginal
stability (cms), given by the locus {u| im(ad/a) = 0}, on which bps states, whose
mass is given by the n= 2 central charge

(where ne, nm are integer electric and magnetic charges) can become marginally stable.
there are then only two singular points at which charged states (monopoles and (ne =
1, nm = 1) dyons) become massless, while w  bosons remain massive. indeed, while

cms

figure 2: the classical moduli space (on the left) ucl = a2/2 has a singular point at the
origin where w  bosons and monopoles are massless. quantum mechanically, this point is
resolved to the cms (on the right), where there are two distinct singularities on the real axis.

w  bosons naturally exist in the semi-classical spectrum, it is known that on crossing
the cms to the strong coupling region, they no longer exist as localised one-particle
states [28, 29].

on the other hand, the relevance of the cms curve when discussing a = 0 is clear
when we recall that the monodromy structure of the function a(u) implies that we can
formally reach the point anthsheet = 0 by winding round the branch cuts (in particular,
the logarithmic branch cut associated with the monopole point u = 2), provided we

10

start somewhere on the rst sheet where the ratio ad/a is rational, i.e. particular
points on the cms. thus fig. 2 formally expresses the quantum mechanical resolution
of the classical point a = 0 to a discontinuous set of points anthsheet = 0 lying above
the cms curve on higher riemann sheets. of course, the fact that such a point does
not lie on the rst sheet means that these points do not represent a restoration of the
su(2) phase.
indeed, the monodromy group is a quantum symmetry, and winding
round to higher sheets simply moves us outside the fundamental domain for a, which
amounts to a relabelling and does not reect a physical change.

to obtain a more physical picture for the lifting of the su(2) phase, we note that
within the u(1) eective theory, the cms itself is not singular except at the points
where monopoles and dyons become massless. instead it reects a degeneracy of states.
however, within the theory as a whole, this degeneracy (and associated marginal sta-
bility) is reected in a singularity of the zfactor for massive states such as the w 
bosons. as noted in [28], this zfactor is given by im (f (a)/a), which vanishes pre-
cisely on the cms. the signicance of this becomes apparent if we consider trying
to follow a trajectory in the moduli space from the semi-classical region, reducing a
toward zero. in doing so we shall necessarily reach the cms, beyond which the w 
bosons are not present in the spectrum [29] and therefore its not possible to nd an
su(2) phase inside this region. therefore it is natural to conclude that the lifting of the
su(2) phase is associated physically with the marginal quantum stability of the w 
bosons at strong coupling whose presence would be required to restore a full massless
su(2) multiplet. we can now interpret the divergence of the potential (23) as a hint
of this transition as one passes below the landau pole.

the d3-brane probe picture

given the relation between the lifting of the su(2) phase and the marginal stability
of w  boson states that we have argued for above, it is of interest to understand the
decay of these states in more detail. however, while this question may be addressed in
certain theories with matter, or larger gauge groups, where cms curves are present at
weak coupling [30], such techniques are not directly applicable for cms curves present
at strong coupling, as is the case here. nonetheless, a simple geometric picture of the
transition across the cms is available within type iib string theory, or more precisely
its extension to f-theory. sen [31] has pointed out that the u(1) eective theory can
be realised as the worldvolume theory on a d3-brane probe in the background of two
mutually non-local 7-branes with the charges of monopoles and (ne = 1, nm = 1)
dyons. within this framework, the bps states present at strong coupling are realised
as strings joining the d3-brane with one of the 7-branes [31]. however, it has been
argued [32] that w  boson states are realised as 4-string junctions, where the junction
must lie on the cms for the state to be supersymmetric (see fig. 3). when the d3-
brane reaches the cms, the junction lies on the brane itself and the the two remaining
prongs can dissociate on the the d3-brane, leaving the expected conguration of a
monopole and a (1,-1) dyon, which is stable inside the cms. clearly, it would be of
interest to understand this phenomenon within eld theory.

4 instanton calculations in n = 1 sqcd
in this section, we turn to n= 1 sqcd with one avour, and recall a number of well-
known features, uncovered in the 1980s [10, 6, 5], which provide additional insight into
the relation between the sci and wci calculations.

sqcd exhibits some useful simplications with regard to instanton calculations 
namely, the 1-instanton saturation of the chiral correlators of interest, and the mass
dependence of the vacuum state (see section 3.1). the model possesses chiral elds
q
f , where  = 1, 2 is the colour index and f = 1, 2 is a sub-avour index. the d-at

directions are parametrised by a modulus supereld x = qqf qf /2. classically, the
addition of a mass perturbation, mx 2, leads to the presence of a single vacuum at
h0||0i = 0 (where  is the lowest component of x), i.e. the su(2) phase, in analogy
with the situation in softly broken n= 2. however, there is also a 1-instanton induced
correction to the superpotential [9], leading to an expression of the form,

wci vs sci calculations

the natural chiral correlators to consider in this case are h0|tr 2(x) tr 2(x)|0i,
and mh0|tr 2(x) 2(x)|0i, where we recall that the rg invariant eld bilinears are

12

tr 2 and m2. in particular, within the wci approach, the 1-instanton contribution
to h0|tr 2(x) 2(x)|0i was considered in a background with a   in [10]. the
instanton action then has the form,

perconformal transformations of the instanton (see e.g.
[11] for details). the large
vev a is associated with the instanton induced superpotential in the massless theory
as discussed above. the result for h0|tr 2(x) 2(x)|0i has the form

h0|tr 2(x) 2(x)|0i = 5

(29)

and has the special feature that it is saturated by zero size instantons. in particular,
the integral i in (29) has the form,

i = z d2

2 d20d2 f (2

inv) = 16h2f (2)  f (2)i

for nonzero a both f (2 = ) and f (2 = ) vanish, and the result (30) for i is

explicitly saturated by zero size instantons,

iwc = 16 f (2 = 0) = 16 .

(33)

this answer is determined by the instanton measure alone. the result displays the
topological features of independence from x  x, a, and from the detailed structure
of the instanton action and the zero modes. moreover, fsc which vanishes at 2 = 0
does not contribute in the wci result, which implies factorization since the connected
contribution comes only from fsc.

we can use the same expressions (30-32) to perform the analogous sci calculation

(see fig. 4) by setting a = 0. then,

isc = 16 fsc(2 = ) = 16

figure 4: one-(anti-)instanton sci contribution to h0|tr 2(x) 2(x)|0i in n= 1 sqcd.

thus we nd that the wci and sci results for h0|tr 2(x) 2(x)|0i actually arise from
dierent sources. while the connected part does not contribute to the wci calculation
which is saturated by  = 0, it does contribute to the sci calculation which is saturated
at  = .

it is also possible to perform the calculation of isc directly following the connected
diagram given in fig. 4 for which one nds a result equal to (34), with the distinction
that it is apparently saturated at   |xx|. we can see that this is in agreement with
the infrared nature of the result (34) by re-introducing a 6= 0 as an infrared regulator
for the calculation. in this case, for any nite a, one observes an exact cancellation
between two integrals saturated respectively in the ranges   |xx| and   2/a, as
discussed in [10]. however, within the sci approach, one ignores the integral saturated
at   2/a leaving a nite result as in (34). thus we see explicitly that as we send
a  0 the discontinuity arises as an infrared eect at  = . thus, although the
details are apparently quite dierent, there is an analogy with softly broken n = 2
sym, in that the sci result may be interpreted in terms of unphysical (in this case
 = ) congurations.

on the consistency of the sci approach

in addition to the arguments presented above, which serve an interpretative role
for the nature of the sci result, this calculation also reveals an additional technical
inconsistency associated with the dierence between the numerical factors relating the
wci and sci calculations for h0|tr 2(x) tr 2(x)|0i and h0|tr 2(x) 2(x)|0i. recall
that the sci calculation for h0|tr 2(x) tr 2(x)|0i in n = 1 sqcd [10] is performed
in analogy with the discussion in section 2, with the distinction that there is only one
mass insertion (see [10, 11] for details). we can express the results of these calculations
in the form,

h0|tr 2(x) 2(x)|0isc =
h0|tr 2(x) tr 2(x)|0isc =

(37)

as we demonstrate below, this expression violates the konishi relation (2) (due to the
dierence between the two coecients in (35) and (36)) and is therefore inconsistent.
this observation is not new (see [4, 6, 5]), but we would like to emphasise here that this
conclusion follows without the imposition of the assumption of cluster-decomposition.
thus we present the argument in some detail.

the main point is that one may generalise the relation (3) to obtain,

(38)

where oi(xi) are the lowest components of chiral superelds. to prove this relation,
we insert a complete set of states between on and the term in square brackets. the
crucial point is that this sum reduces to vacuum states as an immediate consequence of
supersymmetry  the correlators are spacetime independent constants, and contribu-
tions of higher states would imply x-dependence. thus this correlator is proportional
to a series of vacuum expectation values of the form,

"82

(39)

where |0ii refers to any supersymmetric vacuum state. this expression vanishes be-
cause, via the konishi relation (2), we can rewrite it as a vacuum matrix element of a
total derivative, and (38) then follows.

if we specialise (38) to the case at hand, for which it has the form,

tr 2h162m2  tr 2i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
d0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

0e = 0,

(40)

we observe a direct contradiction with (37), implying as stated above that (37) is
inconsistent with the konishi anomaly. although this inconsistency follows trivially if
we assume cluster-decomposition, as has been noted before [4, 6, 5], we emphasise that
we have not needed this additional assumption, i.e. that all chiral expectation values
are diagonal in each vacuum, h0i|o|0ji  ij. of course, a direct implication is that
cluster-decomposition is also violated. given the discussion above which implies that
the sci result does not contribute to the factorisable wci calculation, this conclusion
may not be so surprising.

possible resolutions?

a possible resolution of this discrepancy with the konishi relation was suggested by
amati et al. [6], in that h0|tr 2(x) 2(x)|0i may have a non-analytic mass dependence
at m = 0. an explicit calculation in the limit m   indeed veried consistency with

15

(2), although not with the wci results. we feel that consistency with the konishi
relation is essentially built into this latter calculation as one may see by viewing the
massive eld as a regulator. however, since there is no indication of mass singularities
of this kind within the wci calculation, it is not clear if this resolution suggests a
helpful physical interpretation of the numerical failure of the sci approach. we shall
suggest a slightly dierent interpretation in section 5.

one can ask whether the addition of a chirally symmetric vacuum state [15] would
also resolve the problem. within this model, we have less control than in softly broken
n= 2 as the exact vacuum structure is not strictly determined at strong coupling. an
application of cluster decomposition, with a carefully chosen weight for the symmetric
vacuum, where h0s|tr 2|0si = h0s|2|0si = 0, apparently implies that one can explain
one of the numerical factors in (35) and (36) in this way, but not both. there is a sub-
tlety here in that the kovner-shifman vacuum necessarily contains massless fermions
so as not to contribute to the witten index. thus there is no mass-gap, and the ap-
plicability of cluster-decomposition is not clear. however, we can use arguments based
on supersymmetry as above, to ensure that only vacuum states survive the insertion
of a complete set of states.

cluster-decomposition

it is interesting to contrast this 1-instanton discrepancy with recent work by hol-
lowood et al. [18] on correlators saturated by multi-instanton congurations. therein,
calculations based on the n-instanton measure at large nc, and a numerical study of
a particular su(2) correlator saturated by 2-instanton congurations, led the authors
to conclude that cluster-decomposition was violated within the sci approach. this
failure of cluster decomposition for particular correlators followed despite the fact that
it holds for the n-instanton measure itself [33].

note that this refers to a specic form of cluster-decomposition, namely the fac-
torisation of an n-instanton saturated chiral correlator into a product of 1-instanton
saturated correlators; schematically represented as, (n-instanton)  (1-instanton)n. in
this regard, it is worth recalling that in simplied systems, such as certain 2d sigma
models, where direct strong-coupling instanton calculations can be performed, cluster-
decomposition in the sense of multi-instanton congurations follows from the structure
of the collective coordinate integral (see e.g. [34]). thus, purely at the mathematical
level, the underlying reason for its apparent failure in sci calculations in n = 1 sym
remains something of a mystery. we note only that as we emphasised earlier the clas-
sical moduli space is disconnected. thus it may be more appropriate to consider 2d
sigma models on disconnected target spaces.

in contrast, while the discrepancy we have discussed above also implies a breakdown
of cluster-decomposition in a simple sense, it is quite distinct from these multi-instanton
considerations. specically, we only consider 1-instanton eects, and thus cluster de-
composition represented in the form h0|tr 2(x) 2(x)|0i  h0|2|0ih0|tr 2|0i cannot
be interpreted in terms of a factorisation of instanton contributions. here the notion
is more basic in that, as described above, the wci result factorises trivially as it is

16

eectively a calculation of h0|tr 2|0i in a background eld.

5 concluding remarks

in this note we have discussed various inconsistencies of the strong coupling approach
to the calculation of instanton induced chiral correlators. in particular, we have argued
that within a specic model  softly broken n = 2 sym  the vacuum averaging hy-
pothesis cannot be used to explain the numerical value of h0|tr 2|0isc. furthermore,
within n= 1 sqcd with one avour, although we have no clear picture of the vacuum
structure at strong coupling in this case, we recalled that an apparent technical incon-
sistency at 1-instanton order with the konishi relation is still perfectly consistent with
the factorisability of the weak coupling calculation as the connected part associated
with sci actually vanishes.

since are not strictly at liberty to integrate out the adjoint chiral eld in softly
broken n = 2, we have little to say about the possible existence (or non-existence)
of the chirally symmetric kovner-shifman vacuum in pure n = 1 sym. in particular,
for consistency, we have always assumed when working with an adjoint chiral eld
that m  . for m   there may be additional states to consider, and we are not
guaranteed that vacuum rearrangements will not take place. however, we note that
the arguments of kovner and shifman in favor of the new vacuum rely heavily on the
vacuum averaging hypothesis [7] for sci calculations.

the inconsistencies we have discussed suggest that the sci approach is decient
with regard to extracting physical correlators in the specic n = 1 theories studied
in this paper. in particular, within softly broken n = 2, it is apparent that the sci
calculation, saturated at 1-instanton order, is referred to the su(2) phase which, while
a classical vacuum, is lifted quantum mechanically.
in contrast, the result arising
from the seiberg-witten solution, is instead interpreted as an eect due to an innite
series of instanton corrections within the u(1) phase. thus the discrepancy does not
seem so surprising, and this raises the question of whether the sci result has a well-
dened interpretation. one possibility follows from the fact that the chiral correlators
studied here apparently dene particular topological invariants 3. indeed they bear a
close relation to expectation values calculable on generic backgrounds within wittens
twisted n = 2 formulation of donaldson theory. however, this picture applies quite
generally to the correlators themselves, and is not specic to a particular instanton
approximation. nonetheless, given that the sci approach determines unambiguous
numerical values for these invariants, one may wonder whether they are related to a
particular topological variant of n= 1 sym.

3since we work in at space, this is manifest only in independence from the spacetime coordinates.
extension to specic nontrivial geometries does however indicate dependence only on the intrinsic
topology [2].
