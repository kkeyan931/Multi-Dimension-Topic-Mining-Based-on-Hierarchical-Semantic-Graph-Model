abstract: we consider adhm instantons in product group gauge theories that arise from
d3-branes located at points in the orbifold r6/zp. at nite n we argue that the adhm
construction and collective coordinate integration measure can be deduced from the dynamics
of d-instantons in the d3-brane background. for the large-n conformal eld theories of this
type, we compute a saddle-point approximation of the adhm integration measure and show
that it is proportional to the partition function of d-instantons in the dual ads5  s5/zp
background, in agreement with the orbifold ads/cft correspondence. matching the expected
behaviour of d-instantons, we nd that when s5/zp is smooth a saddle-point solution only
exists in the sector where the instanton charges in each gauge group factor are the same.
however, when s5/zp is singular, the instanton charges at large n need not be the same
and the space of saddle-point solutions has a number of distinct branches which represent the
possible fractionations of d-instantons at the singularity. for the theories with a type 0b dual
the saddle-point solutions manifest two types of d-instantons.

1. introduction

there is a natural relation between d-branes and the adhm construction of multi-instanton
solutions in gauge theory which arises from considering a conguration of k dp-branes embedded
in n coincident d(p + 4)-branes. the embedding is described by a charge k instanton solution
in the four-dimensional su(n) gauge theory associated to the four transverse directions of the
dp-branes in the d(p + 4)-brane world volume [14]. this correspondence is valid for arbitrary
values of n, but in the large-n limit it simplies dramatically [4] leading to powerful instanton
tests [46] of the ads/cft duality in n = 4 gauge theory [7, 8]. thus both at nite n and
in the large-n limit there is a very appealing relation between adhm and d-instantons. it is
this relation in more general theories that we want to further investigate in this paper.

to see how the collective coordinate integration measure for adhm multi-instantons
emerges from d-brane dynamics, consider k d(1)-branes (d-instantons) embedded in n coin-
cident d3-branes. the theory on the world volume of n d3-branes is four-dimensional n = 4
supersymmetric su(n) gauge theory. the k d-instantons correspond to point-like topologi-
cal defects identied with yang-mills instantons of charge k. the theory on the world volume
of the d-instantons describes the yang-mills instanton dynamics. this is a zero-dimensional
matrix theory whose partition function in the strong coupling   0 limit gives the adhm
collective coordinate integration measure (weighted with the instanton action). this relation
holds for arbitrary n and the   0 limit is taken in order to decouple the world volume
theory from gravity in the bulk. this nite-n approach was used in sec. iv.2 of [4] to derive
directly from d-brane dynamics the adhm measure in n = 4 supersymmetric su(n) gauge
theory. the resulting expression is in precise agreement with the expression previously deduced
in ref. [9, 10] from the eld theory considerations alone.

the matrix model describing the d-instantons inside the d3-branes can be viewed as a
dimensional reduction to zero dimensions of the eective theory describing d5-branes inside
d9-branes. the theory on the world volume of the k d5-branes is pure n = (1, 1) super-
symmetric u(k) gauge theory in six dimensions with n, the number of d9-branes, additional
hypermultiplets (and so the resulting theory actually only has n = (1, 0) supersymmetry).
what is particularly striking is that the auxiliary degrees-of-freedom  introduced in [4, 5] to
bi-linearize the four-fermion interaction in the adhm instanton action arise now in a very
natural way as the scalars corresponding to the six-dimensional gauge eld [4] and describe the
freedom for the d-instantons to be ejected from the d3-branes. this geometrical interpretation
of  variables deserves a comment. one might think that since we have started with d5-branes
inside d9-branes and then dimensionally reduced six dimensions common to the both types
of branes, we must end up with d-instantons lying inside the d3-branes, however, this static
reasoning however is nave. the six-dimensional gauge eld  living on the world volume of the

1

d5-branes turns into six scalar elds after the dimensional reduction. the six scalars  specify
excitations of the d-instantons transverse to the d3 world volume. thus, when  are non-zero
the d-instantons are in fact ejected from the world volume of the d3-branes. in the large-n
limit, it turns out that  gains a vev which constrains its length and an s5 is generated!

ref. [4] went on the consider the large-n limit of this measure. using a steepest descent
approximation the result is very simple to state. the large-n gauge invariant adhm measure
is proportional to the partition function of the six-dimensional pure n = (1, 1) supersymmetric
u(k) gauge theory, with no additional matter, dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions. alter-
natively, this can be described as the ten-dimensional n = 1 supersymmetric pure u(k) gauge
theory dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions. this is precisely what one expects for d-
instantons in a at background with no d3 branes present, where the u(1)  u(k) components
of the ten-dimensional gauge eld are interpreted as the position of the charge-k d-instanton
in r10. the only dierence with the large-n measure is that the u(1) components of the gauge
eld are now interpreted as the position of the charge-k d-instanton in ads5  s5, the near
horizon geometry of the n   d3-branes.

to make this more precise it is convenient to view the gauge-invariant adhm integration
measure as a product of two factors: the centre-of-mass measure and the reduced measure. the
centre-of-mass measure includes only the global collective coordinatesthe position, the scale-
size, the supersymmetric and superconformal fermion zero modes, and the -coordinates of the
multi-instanton conguration as the whole. the second factorthe reduced measureincludes
integrations over the remaining relative collective coordinates (relative positions, relative scale
sizes, etc.). it follows from the analysis of ref. [4] that the reduced gauge-invariant adhm
measure in the large-n limit equals the non-abelian part of the d-instanton measure in the at
background, while the centre-of-mass adhm measure gives the volume element of ads5  s5.
this concludes the review of the nite-n and large-n relations between d-instantons and
yang-mills instantons in n = 4 gauge theory. we are now ready to generalize this picture other
theories with n < 4. an interesting class of generalizations of the ads/cft correspondence
[7,8] to four dimensional theories with less than n = 4 supersymmetry, follows from considering
string theory on a background where the s5 is replaced by the quotient s5/, where in general
the nite group  does not necessarily act freely and so the resulting space has singularities
[1113]. for simplicity here we shall only consider the abelian cases  = zp, although our
results have an obvious generalization to the non-abelian cases. the relevant string theory is
either type iib, or the non-supersymmetric type 0b, depending upon the action of zp on the
elds of the theory. there is substantial evidence that the dual gauge theory is simply a certain
zp-projection of the n = 4 theory, where zp acts both on gauge and on the su(4)r indices of
the various elds [12]. the resulting theories can have either n = 0, 1 or 2 supersymmetries.

2

before summarizing our ndings, we briey review the description of the zp-projected

gauge theories and their relation with d-branes on orbifolds.

1.1 the projected n = 4 gauge theories and d-branes on orbifolds

the theories that we will consider can be dened as projections of an n = 4 supersymmetric
gauge theory with a unitary gauge group u(n) [1113]. the projection is obtained by an action
of a nite group  which is embedded in both the gauge group and the su(4)r group of r-
symmetries. the embeddings   u(n) and   su(4)r are specied by the decomposition
of the adjoint representation of the gauge group and the 4 of su(4)r, respectively, into the
irreducible representations of . the projected theory is then dened by the same action of
the n = 4 theory with all the  non-invariant elds set to zero.

the construction outlined above works for any such , however for simplicity, we shall
concentrate on the abelian cases where  = zp. without loss of generality we can take the the
embedding zp  u(n) to be generated by

{nq} =

1[n1][n1]




e2i/p1[n2][n2]

. . .

.




e2(p1)i/p1[np][np]

(1.1)

the embedding zp  su(4)r can be dened by a set of four phases, or equivalently four integers
{q1, q2, q3, q4} dened modulo p, subject to the condition

q1 + q2 + q3 + q4 = 0 mod p .

(1.2)

the gauge eld vn is an su(4)r singlet and hence invariant under zp  su(4)r. on the
fermions a, which transform as a 4 of su(4)r, the action of zp  su(4)r is generated by

a  e2iqa/pa .

(1.3)

the action on the scalar elds which form a 6 of su(4)r (or a vector of so(6)  su(4)r)
is given most easily by writing them as an anti-symmetric tensor aab, subject to the reality
condition1

(aab) = 1

2abcdacd .

(1.4)

1here  acts only on gauge indices and not on su(4)r indices. we frequently pass between the antisymmetric
a aa, where the

tensor representation aab and explicit so(6) vector representation aa, via aab = (1/8) ab
coecients are dened in the appendix of [4]. in particular the inner product aaba  abcdaabbcd.

3

in this basis the action of zp  su(4)r is generated by

aab  e2i(qa+qb)/paab .

(1.5)

the zp action on so(6) vectors as specied above may not give a faithful representation of zp.
this happens when all the combinations qa + qb are even and when p itself is even, in which
case only the subgroup zp/2  zp is faithfully represented on vectors, a subtlety which will
prove to be important.

we are now in a position to implement the zp projection on the elds. taking a combination

of the gauge transformation (1.1) and the action on su(4)r indices (1.3):

{nq}vn1

{nq } = vn ,

{nq}a1

{nq} = e2iqa/pa ,

{nq}aab1

{nq} = e2i(qa+qb)/paab .

(1.6)

hence the gauge group of the projected theory is u(n1)      u(np) with n = pp

element of the gauge group of the projected theory has the block diagonal form

q=1 nq. an


u (1)

[n1][n1]



u (2)

[n2][n2]

. . .

,





u (p)

[np][np]

(1.7)

where u (q)  u(nq). the abelian components of the u(nq) factors actually decouple in the
infra-red and so eectively we can take the gauge group to be su(n1)   su(np).2 in order
to write down the projected elds we introduce a block-form notation for the u(n) adjoint-
valued elds of the parent theory. let eq r be the p p matrix with a one in position (q, r) and
zeros elsewhere.3 the gauge eld of the projected theory has the block-diagonal form

vn =

p

xq=1

v(q)
n  eq q ,

(1.8)

where the block v(q)
n is the gauge eld of the u(nq) subgroup of the gauge group. the fermions
and scalars have o-diagonal components, since the scalar and fermion elds in the original
theory have non-trivial transformations under the r-symmetry:

a =

p

xq=1

(q)a  eq q+qa ,

aab =

p

xq=1

a(q)ab  eq q+qa+qb .

(1.9)

2this decoupling is valid in the context of a four dimensional theory, however, we shall also use the same

kind of projection in lower dimensional theories where the decoupling does not occur.

3we will always think of the labels q, r, qa, etc., as being dened modulo p.

4

one can see that the spectrum of elds in the theory consists of the gauge bosons of
the product gauge group along with various matter elds that transform in bi-fundamental
representations (nq, nr) of a pair of the group factors, or adjoint representations of a single
u(nq) factor. the amount of supersymmetry depends on the set of integers {q1, q2, q3, q4}. we
can take (subject to (1.2)):

(i) {0, 0, q3, q4} (without loss of generality we can take q3 = q4 = 1). these models
have n = 2 supersymmetry and zp leaves two components of an so(6) vector xed (in su(4)
language the two components a12 and a34).

(ii) {0, q2, q3, q4} with q2, q3, q4 6= 0 mod p. these models have n = 1 supersymmetry
(iii) all the other case have n = 0 supersymmetry.
these theories describe the low energy dynamics of d3-branes on the orbifold r4  r6/zp,
where the d3-branes lie along the r4 factor and so at a point on the r6/zp orbifold [14].
one way to analyze this set-up is to consider the d3-branes on the covering space r10 using a
method of images. each d3-brane will then come with its images under zp. so each collection
of n d3-branes at the same point in r6 will have p images. this naturally gives rise to the
gauge theory described above but with n  n1 =    = np. this is situation where the adjoint
of the original u(n)  u(pn) theory decomposes into n copies of the regular representation of
zp. however, there is more freedom if the d3-branes are at the singularity of the orbifold [14].
in that case, there are no images and consequently one can permit the more general situation
with gauge group u(n1)      u(np). each u(nq) factor describes nq fractional d3-branes
which are conned to move on the orbifold singularity [1416]. in this case p fractional d3-
branes of each of the p types can form a genuine d3-brane which can then move away from the
singularity.4

it turns out that it is precisely the theories where the d3-branes can roam on the orbifold,
i.e. n  n1 =    = np, which are relevant for large-n limit and an ads/cft duality, because
these theories are, for n = 1 and 2, conformal, and, for n = 0, conformal at leading order
in 1/n [13]. for the supersymmetric theories the large-n dual is conjectured to be type iib
superstring theory on ads5  s5/zp [11]. for n = 2 supersymmetry the action of zp xes an
s1  s5 and so the resulting spacetime has an orbifold singularity and consequently there is no
supergravity description (unless the singularity is blown up in some way). on the contrary for
the n = 1 theories there are no singularities and we expect to have a supergravity description
in the appropriate limit. notice that in this case there is an important dierence between the
at orbifold r4  r6/zp and the near horizon geometry ads5  s5/zp. the former has an

4it is interesting to view these fractional d3-branes in a t-dual set-up [17] where they correspond to a

segment of d4-brane suspended between two ns5-branes as in [18].

orbifold singularity at the origin of r6, whereas there is no such singularity in the latter since
the radius of the s5 is constant over ads5 [11]. this fact will turn out to have an important
implication for the large-n limit of the instanton measure.

for the n = 0 theories the situation is slightly more complicated because there are two
cases depending on whether zp  so(6)  su(4) or not.
in general only the subgroup
zp/2  zp acts faithfully on so(6) vectors. in this case the element whose action on so(6)
vectors is not faithfully represented acts on the elds as (1)f , where f is the fermion number
operator. when zp does act faithfully then the large-n dual is expected to be the type iib
superstring on ads5  s5/zp, as for the supersymmetric cases. however, when only zp/2 acts
faithfully, the appearance of the factor (1)f is a clue that in this case the dual theory is not
the type iib superstring but rather is the non-supersymmetric type 0b string. in particular,
when p = 2, this is precisely the projection of the n = 4 which is thought to be dual to the
non-supersymmetric type 0b string on ads5  s5 [19,20]. in general we expect the dual theory
to be the type 0b string on ads5  s5/zp/2.

1.2 summary of results

as in ref. [4] we can investigate the general zp-projected theories at nite n by considering the
dynamics of d3-branes and d-instantons in the at orbifold background r4 r6/zp, where the
d3-branes lie along r4 and hence at a point on the orbifold r6/zp. in particular if the d3-branes
lie at the orbifold singularity then the resulting gauge theory can have the general product group
structure u(n1)  u(np) with matter elds transforming in bi-fundamental representations
generalizing to a six-dimensional orbifold the set-up in ref. [14]. this theory is the zp-projection
of the n = 4 supersymmetric gauge theory with gauge group u(n), n = pp
q=1 nq, described
in the last section. we will argue that the matrix theory of d-instantons which lie at the
orbifold singularity in the presence of the d3-branes is a certain zp-projection of the u(k)
matrix theory describing the d-instantons in the n = 4 case, as described in more detail in
sec. 3.2.5 the discrete group zp is embedded in the u(k) group of the matrix theory as {kq}
and in the u(n) avour group as {nq}. the group also acts, as in (1.3), on su(4)r, which
in the matrix model is the covering group of the lorentz group of the parent six-dimensional
theory. the resulting theory consequently has symmetry groups u(k1)      u(kp) and
u(n1)   u(np). we argue that the partition function of the resulting matrix model in the
decoupling limit   0 is precisely the adhm measure in the gauge theory in the instanton
charge sector c = {k1, . . . , kp}, generalizing the n = 4 case in [4] in an obvious way.
in
particular, in the n = 2 case the resulting theories arise from the dimensional reduction of the
d3 and d7-brane congurations in the r4/zp orbifold background described in [14].

5in our notation kq is the instanton charge for the u(nq) factor of the gauge group. we also dene k =

k1 +  + kp to be the total instanton charge.

6

we then consider the large-n gauge invariant measure for adhm instanton in the con-
formal theories with gauge group u(n)      u(n) (p-times) and nd the following results.
firstly, in (i) and (ii) below, for the theories whose dual is the type iib theory (i.e. all the
supersymmetric theories and the n = 0 theories where zp acts faithfully on so(6) vectors):

(i) when zp acts freely on so(6) vectors, a solution of the large-n saddle-point equations
for the instanton measure only exists in the sector where all the instanton charges are the same.
in other words when s5/zp is smooth in the dual theory, only the c = {k, . . . , k} charge sectors
contribute at leading order in 1/n. the saddle-point solution describes k point-like objects, the
d-instantons of the string theory, moving in ads5 s5/zp. the large-n instanton measure has
the form of the partition function of the zp-projected n = 1 supersymmetric u(k)  u(pk)
gauge theory in ten dimensions, dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions. this theory has
gauge group u(k)      u(k). equivalently we may describe it as the zp-projection of the
n = (1, 1) pure six-dimensional u(k) gauge theory dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions.
the saddle-point solution corresponds to the coulomb branch of the matrix theory where the
u(k)      u(k) gauge symmetry is generically broken to u(1)k

diag.6

(ii) when zp does not act freely on so(6) vectors a solution of the saddle-point equations ex-
ists in the general charge sector where the instanton numbers can be dierent c = {k1, . . . , kp}.
in this case, the saddle-point solutions have multiple branches labelled by k = 0, . . . , min(kq).
the branches describe k d-instantons moving in ads5s5/zp and kqk fractional d-instantons
of type q moving in ads5  (s5/zp)sing. (here (s5/zp)sing is the subspace of s5 xed by the
action of zp.) the large-n instanton measure is then described by the partition function of
the zp-projected n = 1 ten-dimensional u(k) gauge theory dimensionally reduced to zero
dimensions, as in (i), but with the more general zp-projection which permits the gauge group
u(k1)      u(kp) (or as in (i) equivalently the zp-projection of the n = (1, 1) pure six-
dimensional u(k) gauge theory dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions). the saddle-point
solutions correspond to a series of coulomb branches of the matrix theory where the symmetry
diag  u(1)kpk. when k = k1 =    = kp this
u(k1)      u(kp) is generically broken to u(1)k
is identical to the coulomb branch in (i) above.

(iii) in the non-supersymmetric theories with a type 0b dual where only zp/2  zp acts
faithfully on so(6) vectors, the solution of the saddle-point equations is slightly more compli-
cated. in this case, we split the instantons into two sets with charges

c+ = {k2, k4, . . . , kp} ,

c = {k1, k3, . . . , kp1} .

(1.10)

from the point-of-view of the saddle-point analysis the two sets of instantons are completely
decoupled.7 for each set c separately the solutions of the saddle-point equations is analogous

6this is the maximal abelian subgroup of the diagonal subgroup u(k)diag  u(k)    u(k).
7the point is that the two sets only communicate through fermionic variables which play no role in the

7

to (i) and (ii) above. so if zp/2 acts freely on s5 then a saddle-point solution only exists if
each of the instanton charges in each sets c is the same: c = {k, . . . , k}. in this case
the solution can be interpreted as describing two kinds of d-instantons in ads5  s5/zp/2.
on the contrary, if zp/2 does note act freely on s5, then saddle-point solutions exist in the
general {k1, . . . , kp} charge sectors. as in the type iib cases the solutions now exhibit multiple
branches describing the fractionation of the two kinds of d-instantons.

beginning with the type iib cases, our results are exactly what one would expect from
generalizing the result of the same analysis in the n = 4 theory [4]. in other words we nd
that the large-n adhm instanton measure is identical to the d-instanton partition function
on the at orbifold r4  r6/zp. this is to be expected: as in the n = 4 theory the partition
function for d-instantons on ads5  s5 is identical to that in at space. however, there is an
important restriction in the cases when s5/zp is smooth. in the corresponding at orbifold,
describing the nite-n solution, the d-instantons could lie at the singularity and one would
have contributions from the general charge sector {k1, . . . , kp} corresponding to fractional d-
instantons. however the near horizon geometry ads5  s5/zp is smooth and so we expect only
the charge sector {k, . . . , k} can contribute at large n and this is precisely what we nd from
our saddle-point analysis for case (i). when s5/zp has a singularity there is no such constraint
on the charge sector as we nd from the saddle-point analysis in case (ii). in this case the space
of solutions has a number of dierent branches which represents the possible fractionations of
d-instantons at the singularity (s5/zp)sing.

for the theories whose duals are the type 0b string theory the situation is essentially
doubled up: in this case the instantons in the even/odd groups in the product u(n)  u(n)
are independently interpreted as in the last paragraph with d-instantons in the string theory.
it is interesting that this is exactly what is expected from the type 0b string theory since the
number of ramond-ramond elds is doubled up compared with the type iib theory. this
means that each d-brane comes in two varieties: magnetic and electric. it is pleasing that
this feature also emerges as the outcome of a saddle-point analysis of large-n gauge theory
instantons.

2. the adhm construction for product groups

in this section we consider the construction of multi-instanton solutions for the projected n = 4
theory. the construction is a very obvious generalization of the adhm formalism set out in [4].
the new feature is that some of the matter elds transform in bi-fundamental representations
of a pair of the gauge group factors. fortunately this problem was considered in the early

saddle-point analysis.

8

instanton literature [21] as part of a program to construct solutions for elds transforming in
arbitrary representations of a gauge group in the back-ground of an adhm instanton. the
resulting formalism is such an obvious generalization of that for an adjoint-valued eld that we
will keep our discussion brief. note that as far as the instanton solutions are concerned there
is no dierence between u(nq) and su(nq) since the instanton is embedded in the non-abelian
part of the gauge group.

2.1 the gauge elds

first of all consider the gauge elds. to leading order in the coupling one simply ignores the
matter elds and considers the gauge elds in isolation. at this order, there are no couplings
between the dierent su(nq) group factors; in order words, one constructs a general instanton
solution by embedding instanton solutions with charges kq, q = 1, . . . , p, in each of the su(nq)
factors. the adhm construction then involves the familiar objects u (q), u (q), (q), a(q), b(q),
f (q), a(q)
 , etc., for each of the groups.8 as with the gauge elds of the theory, it is
convenient to assemble the adhm parameters for the product group into p  p block diagonal
matrix where each block pertains to a single su(nq) factor. so, for example

n , w(q)

a =

p

xq=1

a(q)  eq q .

(2.1)

the matrix a(q) is then the adhm matrix of the qth gauge group factor, and hence is (nq +
2kq)  2kq dimensional.

the adhm variables, modulo the adhm constraints, parameterize the moduli space of

the instanton solution, up to an auxiliary symmetry

where each factor u(kq) acts on the variables of the qth block in the way described in [4].

u(k1)      u(kp) ,

(2.2)

2.2 the fermion elds

up till now we have simply used p independent copies of the adhm construction one for
each of the su(nq) group factors. this is obvious because the gauge elds of each su(nq)
factor of the instanton solution are completely decoupled. for any matter eld which is in an
adjoint representation of the gauge group, an eventuality that will occur if some qa = 0, for
the fermions, or some qa + qb = 0, for the scalars, the construction of the solution is exactly

8we will assume that the reader is familiar with sec. ii of [4].

9

as [4]. the matter elds, however, can communicate between the dierent factors since some
of them are in bi-fundamental representations.

let us consider the general problem of a fermion  transforming in the bi-fundamental
(nq, nr) of su(nq) su(nr). the equation we have to solve is the dirac equation /d  = 0
for  in the background of an instanton solution with charge kq and kr in each of the two
group factors, respectively. the solution generalizes that for an adjoint fermion [21] and has
the form

 = u (q)m(q r)f (r)b(r)

 u (r)  u (q)b(q)

 f (q) m(q r)u (r),

(2.3)

where u (q) and u (r), etc., refer to objects from the adhm construction for the groups su(nq)
and su(nr), respectively. the o-diagonal objects m(q r) and m(q r) are constant grassmann
matrices of dimension (nq + 2kq)  kr and kq  (nr + 2kr), respectively. the dirac equation is
then satised by virtue of the fermionic adhm constraints

(q)
 m(q r) + m(q r)(r)

 = 0 .

(2.4)

equations (2.3),(2.4) correctly reproduce the adjoint fermion zero mode construction [4, 21, 22]
when nq = nr and kq = kr, while when kr = 0 the su(nq) fundamental fermion zero mode
construction is recovered [21,22]. in the latter case (r)
 and m(q r) are trivial, and the collective
coordinates m(q r) are unconstrained, just as required.

it is now rather easy to see how to generalize the construction when we have a collection
of fermion elds that transform in a set of adjoint and bi-fundamental representations of the
product group as in (1.9). the trick is to write the fermionic collective coordinates in terms of
the block-form matrices already introduced in (1.9). to this end we introduce ma and ma
that are four (n + 2k)  k and k  (n + 2k) matrices of constant grassmann numbers with
non-zero elements in particular blocks:

ma =

p

xq=1

m(q)a  eq q+qa ,

(2.5)

where m(q)a  m(q q+qa)a and m(q)a  m(q q+qa)a. the adhm constraints for all the
fermions can therefore be written in a single equation as
 ma + ma  = 0 .

(2.6)

2.3 the scalar elds

in this section, we consider the adhm formalism for the scalar elds. the construction for
the scalar elds in the background of an instanton solution follows the same pattern as in the
n = 2 theories [22] and in the n = 4 theories [4].

10

to leading order, the scalar elds satisfy the covariant klein-gordon equation, with a
source term bi-linear in fermions coming from the yukawa interactions. fortunately, the most
obvious generalization of the solution in the n = 4 theory provides the solution in the projected
theories. as in the n = 4 theory it is convenient to imagine a set of collective coordinates for
the scalar elds, even though no actual moduli exist. in our theories, these pseudo collective
coordinates take the block form

aab =

p

xq=1

a(q)ab  eq q+qa+qb

(2.7)

where a(q)ab is a kqkq+qa+qb matrix. the pseudo collective coordinates are then eliminated
at some later stageby the algebraic equations

here the right-hand side involves a bilinear in the fermionic collective coordinates

l  aab = ab .

ab =

1

22 (cid:0) mamb  mbma(cid:1)

(2.8)

(2.9)

and reects the yukawa source term. in (2.9), the linear operator l on k  k matrices is
dened by

l   = 1

2{  , w 0 } + [ a

n , [ a

n ,  ] ] ,

where k  k hermitian matrix w 0 has the block-diagonal components

w (q)0 = w(q)  w(q)
 ,

for later use, we dene the components of l with respect to the block-form basis:

p

2w (r)0 + a(r)

n a(r)

n )  2a(q)

n a(r)

.

(2.13)

2.4 the multi-instanton action

when the expressions for the gauge, fermions and scalar elds are substituted into the action
the result is not simply a constant, but contains an interaction term which depends on the
fermionic collective coordinates:

sinst =

82k
g2  ik + squad ,

(2.14)

11

where squad is a fermion quadrilinear interaction

squad =

2
g2 abcd trk abacd =

2
g2 abcd trk abl1cd .

(2.15)

the expression for squad is derived in a completely analogous way to the n = 4 theory [4].

this is somewhat of a surprise: one might have expected the action to be a constant if we
have a solution of the euler-lagrange equations. as explained in [4], the adhm expressions
for the gauge, fermion and scalar elds are not, in fact an exact solution to the euler-lagrange
equations when all the fermion modes are turned-on. the fact is that although the fermion
zero modes are dirac zero-modes, the majority of them are lifted at tree level by the yukawa
interactions with the scalars. the philosophy that we adopt, and explained at length in [4], is
that retaining collective coordinates for the lifted modes provide a convenient way of including
the perturbative (tree level) eects of the modes. in this point-of-view, the only exact fermion
zero modes, not lifted by (2.15), are the supersymmetric and superconformal zero modes. these
modes are dened in terms of ma and ma, as in the n = 4 case [4], but only for qa = 0,
giving 8, 4 and 0 modes, for n = 2, 1 and 0, respectively.

3. the collective coordinate measure

in this section we write down the integration measure on the space of adhm collective coor-
dinates and then show how for nq  2kq it can be reduced to a measure on the set of gauge
invariant variables. then in this new set of variables, the adhm constraints will be explicitly
resolved. note that the restriction nq  2kq is certainly consistent with the large-n limit.

3.1 the at measure

in order to calculate physical quantities we need to know how to integrate on the space of
adhm variables. this is the measure induced from the full functional integral of the eld
theory. thankfully, repeating the argument of refs. [4, 9, 10] it turns out that the measure is
remarkably simple when written in terms of the complete set of bosonic and fermionic adhm
variables: it is just the at measure for all the variables with all algebraic constraints imposed
via explicit delta functions. in order to dene the physical measure, we must divide by the

12

volume of the auxiliary group (2.2):

1

z d{kq}
 yc=1,2,3

q=1 vol u(kq) z da d w dw ya=1,2,3,4

dma da da yb=2,3,4

da1b

[q1+qb](cid:0)l  a1b  1b(cid:1) .

(3.1)

the  above indicates that in contrast with our previous work [4, 9, 10] we are not going to
keep track of the overall normalization of the measure. in the above, both the integrals and
the delta functions are dened with respect to a particular basis of matrices. a given k  k
matrix quantity with block-form m = pp
q=1 m (q)  eq q+r, where m (q) is a kq  kq+r matrix,
can be expanded in the basis of k  k matrices t (r)
a :

m =

nr

xa=1

mat (r)

a

,

(3.2)

where nr = pp

rsab. the delta functions in (3.1) are dened as

q=1 kqkq+r and the basis t (r)

a , with t (r)

a = t (r)

, is normalized by trk t (r)

a t (s)

(3.3)

the pseudo collective coordinates for the scalar elds aab can be explicitly integrated out:

z yb=2,3,4

da1b yb=2,3,4

[q1+qb](cid:0)l  a1b  1b(cid:1)

yq=1 ya<b(cid:0)det l(q q+qa+qb)(cid:1)1/2 .

the last equality follows from (1.2) and the fact that det l(q r) = det l(r q).

(3.4)

the measure (3.1) must be augmented with the instanton action, exp sinst and, as we
discuss in sec. 3.3, the ratio of the uctuation determinants in the n = 0 cases. following
the n = 4 example, it is convenient to bi-linearize the fermion quadrilinear interaction by
introducing a set of auxiliary bosonic collective coordinates ab:

p

yq=1 ya<b(cid:0)det l(q q+qa+qb)(cid:1)1/2

exp squad

 z d exp(cid:2)  trk ala + 4ig1trk abab(cid:3) .

(3.5)

13

notice that this transformation absorbs the determinant factors appearing in (3.4). the aux-
iliary variables ab form an antisymmetric pseudo real tensor of so(6) whose elements are
k  k matrices subject to

1

2abcdcd = 

ab ,

(3.6)

where  acts only on instanton indices. the variables ab can be written as an explicit so(6)r
vector a, a = 1, . . . , 6, by using the coecients a

ab =

the matrices ab have the following block structure

3.2 the adhm measure and d-branes

(3.7)

(3.8)

in this section, we argue that the measure that we have constructed in terms of the bosonic
 , a, a}, can be derived by con-
variables {a
sidering the dynamics of d-instantons in the background of d3-branes.

n, ab, w , w } and the fermionic variables {ma

let us briey re-cap the same story in the n = 4 theory described in sec. iv.2 of ref. [4].
in order to describe the d(1)-d3 system one starts with the d5  d9 system and then di-
mensionally reduces. we are interested in the world-volume theory of the d5-branes which on
dimensional reduction will describe the matrix model of the d-instantons. the six-dimensional
theory describing the k d5-branes consists of a u(k) vector multiplet of n = (1, 1) super-
symmetry with elds {a,ma
n, dc} and n fundamental hypermultiplets of n = (1, 0)
supersymmetry with elds {w , w , a, a}.9

 ,  

a, a

in ref. [4] we showed that the partition function of the matrix theory resulting from the
dimensional reduction to zero dimensions of the six-dimensional theory whose eld content is
described above in the strong coupling limit (corresponding to   0) is precisely the adhm
k-instanton measure (weighted with the action). the relation between the elds of the six-
dimensional theory and the adhm construction is manifest, except for the bosonic variables
dc and the fermionic variables  
a. these elds may be eliminated by their equations-of-motion
9the indices are dened as follows: a = 1, . . . , 6 and a = 1, . . . , 4 are spacetime su(4) vector and spinor
indices;  = 1, 2 and  = 1, 2 are spinor indices of the su(2)l  su(2)r r-symmetry group of the theory;
n = 1, . . . , 4 is a vector index of so(4)  su(2)lsu(2)r and nally c = 1, 2, 3 labels the adjoint representation
of su(2)r.

14

and they simply enforce the bosonic and fermionic adhm constraints by producing the explicit
delta functions as in our adhm measure (3.1).

we now describe how this relation extends to the projected theories. the idea is a simple
extension of the n = 4 case to the case where the d-instantons and d3-branes move on the
orbifold spacetime r4  r6/zp. the d3-branes lie along r4 and at the singularity of the
orbifold. the world-volume theory of the d3-branes is the zp-projected u(n) gauge theory as
described in sec. 1.2. now we want to consider the matrix theory of k d-instantons moving
in the d3-brane world volume. not surprisingly the resulting theory will be identical to the
n = 4 case, but with a zp projection. it is easy to see how the projection must act on the
matrices. firstly it is embedded in the u(k) symmetry (the remnant of the six-dimensional
gauge symmetry) as {kq} and in the u(n) symmetry (the remnant of the avour symmetry
of the six-dimensional theory) as {nq}. finally it acts on su(4) spacetime indices of the
six-dimensional parent theory as in (1.3). explicitly on the bosonic adhm variables

{kq}a

n1
n , {nq}w 1
{kq} = a
{nq} = w  , {kq}ab1
{kq} w 1

{kq} = w  ,

(3.9)

and on the fermionic adhm variables

{kq} = e2iqa/pma

{nq }a1

{kq} = e2iqa/pa ,

finally on the lagrange multipliers for the adhm constraints

{kq}dc1

{kq} = dc ,

{kq} 

a1

{kq} = e2iqa/p 

a .

(3.11)

the resulting theory has the expected symmetries: u(k1)   u(kp), the auxiliary symmetry
of the adhm construction (2.2), and u(n1)   u(np), the gauge symmetry of the original
zp-projected gauge theory. notice that, as in the n = 4 case, the variables ab describe the
freedom for the d-instantons to be ejected from the d3-branes in the orbifold directions, the
six directions orthogonal to the d3-brane world-volume.

3.3 fluctuation determinants for n = 0

the adhm collective coordinate measure that we have constructed in the non-supersymmetric
cases needs to be supplemented with the determinants of the uctuations of the various elds,
gauge, fermion, scalar and ghosts, around the instanton solution. fortunately, in a supersym-
metric theory, it was shown by dadda and di vecchia [23], that the determinants all cancel
in a self-dual, i.e. instanton background. the purpose of this section is to consider the deter-
minants in the n = 0 theories and show that they will not aect the large-n saddle-point

15

analysis undertaken in sec. 4. this is not surprising as the theories we consider have the
vanishing beta-function in the large-n limit.

r

let us dene (v,f,s)

to be the appropriate generalized laplacian operators that govern
the uctuations in the vector, weyl fermion and complex scalar elds, respectively, around the
instanton solution, in the representation r of the gauge group.10 for each of these operators
we will dene a suitably regularized determinant:

the details of the regularization procedure will not be relevant for our purposes. the uctua-
tions for all the elds will contribute

det (v,f,s)

r

= exp (v,f,s)

r

.

(3.12)

to the classical measure. in the above rf and rs are the representations of the gauge group
of the weyl fermions and complex scalar elds, respectively.

f = exp(cid:0)(v)

(3.14)

(in the vector case the ghost contribution is included) and consequently the contribution (3.13)
is

f = exp(cid:0)(s)

adj  (s)

rf

+ (s)
rs(cid:1) .

in a supersymmetric theory there is a weyl fermion superpartner to the gauge eldthe
gluinoand a weyl fermionic superpartner to each complex scalar eld; consequently rf =
adj + rs and the determinants all cancel, i.e. f = 1.

the uctuations will only contribute to measure in the n = 0 cases where in order to evalu-
ate the contribution we need the expression for (s)
r , where r is either an adjoint representation
of su(nq) or a bi-fundamental representation (n q, n r) of su(nq)  su(nr). fortunately, ex-
pressions for these determinants were calculated some time ago [24]. for a bi-fundamental
representation

(n q, nr) = nq(s)
(s)

nq + nr(s)

nr  log det l(q r) +

1

162 z d4x log detf (q) (cid:3)2 log detf (r) .

(3.16)

in the above, f (q), is the kq  kq adhm matrix of the su(nq) factor. the operator l(q r) is
dened in (2.13). the result for the adjoint representation of su(nq) follows by a restriction
[24]:

(s)
adjq

= 2nq(s)

nq  log det l(q q) +

1

162 z d4x log detf (q) (cid:3)2 log detf (q) .

(3.17)

10for the vector elds, of course, only the adjoint representation is relevant.

16

notice that in both cases (3.16) and (3.17), the only nq dependence comes from the rst term
only, involving the determinant of the n q representation. it is fortunate that the cumbersome
regularization dependent expression for (s)

nq will not required (see [2527] for details).

to get the uctuation contribution to the measure, we need to consider the product over the
various elds. although, the nal result is non-vanishing for the non-supersymmetric theories,
signicantly the nq dependent and regularization dependent parts of (3.16) and (3.17) cancel
between the bosons and fermions to leave the followingnq independentcontribution to the
measure:

f =

p

yq=1n(f (q q))1 ya<b

(f (q q+qa+qb))1/2ya

f (q q+qa)o ,

where

f (q r) = det l(q r) exp 

1

162 z d4x log detf (q) (cid:3)2 log detf (r) .

for the supersymmetric theories, since q1 = 0, we have

ya

f (q q+qa) = f (q q) ya<b

(f (q q+qa+qb))1/2 ,

(3.18)

(3.19)

(3.20)

and so f = 1, as expected from the general analysis of dadda and di vecchia [23].

the main result that we take away from this section is that in the n = 0 theories where
the uctuation determinants contribute to the measure, there is no nq dependence in the nal
result and so these terms play no role in the large-n saddle-point approximation of the measure
undertaken in sec. 4.

3.4 the gauge invariant measure

since the measure is used to calculate the correlation functions of gauge invariant operator
insertions, it is convenient, following [4], to change variables to a set of gauge invariant param-
eters and to explicitly integrate over the gauge degrees-of-freedom which parameterize a coset
space. as explained in [4], this brings along a very signicant advantage; namely the non-linear
bosonic adhm constraints become trivial and can be explicitly integrated out.

a natural set of gauge-invariant collective coordinates, for nq  2kq, is obtained by con-

structing bosonic bilinear variables w with diagonal blocks:

w (q) 


= w(q)  w(q)


.

(3.21)

17

in terms of the 2k  2k matrix w , we then dene

w 0 = tr2 w, w c = tr2  cw, c = 1, 2, 3 ,

(3.22)

where w 0 appeared previously in (2.11).

the gauge invariant measure then follows from the identity [4]

z gauge

coset

dw(q) d w(q)  (cid:0)det2kq w (q)(cid:1)nq2kq dw (q)0 yc=1,2,3

dw (q)c ,

(3.23)

valid for nq  2kq, applied to each diagonal block. the constant of proportionality was derived
in ref. [4] but will not be needed for our present purposes. as already mentioned earlier, going
to a gauge invariant measure brings a very signicant advantage: we can integrate out the
adhm -functions explicitly.
in the bosonic sector, the adhm constraints can be written
succinctly in terms of the gauge invariant variables as [4]

0 = w c  i[ a

n , a

m ] c

nm .

(3.24)

the remarkable feature of this re-writing of the constraints is that it is linear in w c and
consequently the w c integrals simply remove the bosonic adhm -functions in (3.1).

there is a similar story in the fermionic sector. first of all we decompose

a = w  a + a,

a =   w  + a .

(3.25)

here  a and a have the same block diagonal form as ma as in (2.5). so  (q) a and  (q)a
have dimension kq  kq+qa, while (q)a and (q)a have dimension (nq  2kq)  kq+qa and kq 
(nq+qa  2kq+qa), respectively. the variables a lie in the orthogonal subspace to w , in the
sense that



in terms of the new variables the fermionic adhm constraints (2.6) are

w a = 0,

aw  = 0 .

the  a

 integrals then remove the fermionic adhm -functions in (3.1).

 a
 w


 + w  

a +(cid:2)ma, a

 (cid:3) = 0 .

(3.26)

(3.27)

furthermore, in the fermionic sector we can integrate out the a and a variables; this
being the fermionic version of integrating over the gauge coset [4]. in order to do this, it is
useful to split the fermion bilinear (2.9) that couples to ab in (3.5) as

ab = ab + ab,

(3.28)

18

where the rst term has components just depending on {a, a}:

ab =

1

22 (cid:0)ab  ba(cid:1) ,

and the second term depends on the remaining variables

ab =

1

22(cid:0)  a

 w 


b   b

 w 


a + {ma,mb

 }(cid:1) ,

(3.29)

(3.30)

where  a
 is eliminated by the fermionic adhm constraints (3.27). we can now explicitly
integrate out the as and as. in general, unless k1 =    = kp, the result is rather cumbersome
to write down and for the large-n calculation with n  n1 =    = np, to be undertaken in
sec. 4, we need only note

z ya=1,2,3,4

da da exp(cid:2)8ig1trk ab ab(cid:3)  (det4k)n .

(3.31)

4. the large-n instanton measure

in this section we investigate the adhm gauge-invariant instanton measure for the conformal
eld theories with n  n1 =    = np in the large-n limit by a steepest descent method
following ref. [4]. our primary purpose is to determine the dependence of the large-n measure
on the variables of the adhm construction and so we shall not keep track of the numerical
pre-factor as we did in the n = 4 theory.

4.1 the saddle-point equations and their solution

in order to take the large n limit of the multi-instanton measure, we have to gather together
all the terms which involve the exponential of a quantity times n. as explained in [4], after

rescaling ab  nab, there are three terms that contribute to what can be viewed as an

eective action:

se = 2k(1 + 3 log 2)  log det2kw  log det4k + trk ala .

(4.1)

the second and third terms come from (3.23) and (3.31) while the nal term comes from
(3.5). fortunately, as we have explained in sec. 3.3, the uctuation determinants give an n
independent contribution and so do not play any role in the saddle-point analysis.

we can now perform a steepest descent approximation of the measure which involves nding
n. the resulting

where we have introduced the matrices

(w 1)0 = tr2 w 1,

(w 1)c = tr2  cw 1 .

(4.2)

(4.3)

we note that the expression for the eective action (4.1) and the saddle point equations
(4.2) look identical to those derived in [4] for the unprojected n = 4 theory. the solutions
of these equations, however, will not be the same as they have to be invariant under the zp
projection. this means that w 0 and a
n have the block-diagonal form (2.1), while ab is
generally o-diagonal (3.8). with this in mind we shall use the analysis of the n = 4 theory
as a guide and draw heavily on the results derived in [4]. as in the n = 4 case we look for a
solution with w c = 0, c = 1, 2, 3, which means that the instantons are embedded in mutually
commuting su(2) subgroups of the gauge group. in this case equations (4.2) are equivalent to

[a

n, a

m] = [a

n, ab] = [ab, cd] = 0 , w 0 = 1

2(aa)1 .

(4.4)

the nal equation can be viewed as giving the value of w 0, the instanton sizes, at the saddle-
point and clearly aa and w 0 must be non-degenerate.

in the appendix we prove that in the type iib case when s5/zp is smooth there is no
solution to (4.4) unless k  k1 =    = kp. for the analogous type 0b case, when s5/zp/2
is smooth, a solution only exists in the charge sector with k+  k2 = k4 =    = kp and
k  k1 = k3 =    = kp1. for the type iib case, the general solution, up to the auxiliary
symmetry, has the block-form

so the coordinates i

ab} in ads5  (s5/zp)sing. the solution breaks the auxiliary symmetry
positions {i,q, x i,q
to u(1)k
diag  u(1)kpk. in the case k  k1 =    = kp on the branch with k = k we recover the
solution (4.5).

qa + qb = 0 ,
qa + qb 6= 0 .

(4.7)

in the type 0b theories, the solutions are generalizations of those above with the fol-
lowing dierence. there are now two kinds of d-instanton associated to the even and odd
in particular, when s5/zp/2 is smooth a solution only exist in the charge sector
blocks.
{k, k+, k, . . . , k+}. the fact that d-instantons now come in two types matches precisely
our expectation of the type 0b string theory.

4.2 the large-n instanton measure

in this section we construct the large-n instanton measure. in principle, we have to expand
the eective action around the general solutions written down in the last section to sucient
order to ensure that the uctuation integrals converge. in general because the gaussian form
has zeros whenever two d-instantons coincide one has to go to quartic order in the uctuations.
fortunately, as explained in [4], we do not need to expand about the most general solution to
the saddle-point equations to quartic order since this is equivalent to expanding to the same
order around the most degenerate solution where all the d-instantons (in our present case both
fractional and non-fractional) are at the same point in ads5  s5/zp. the resulting quartic
action has at directions corresponding to the relative positions of the d-instantons. we can
then recover the original expansion that we wanted by re-expanding this action around some
general point along a at direction.
it can then be established ex post facto that this is a
consistent procedure.

when s5/zp has a singularity, the maximally degenerate solution is (4.7) with all the
in particular, unless k1 =    = kp there are fractional d-

instantons at the same point.
instantons and this means that only the components ab with qa + qb = 0 are non-zero:

w 0 = 221[k][k] ,

n = xn1[k][k] , ab = 1 ab1[k][k] ,
a

(4.8)

where as before ab is a unit vector in the directions xed by zp. the desired result for the
large-n measure is immediate because on the saddle-point solution (4.8) all the variables are
proportional to the identity matrix as in the n = 4 case and one can essentially copy the analysis
of ref. [4] verbatim. the result is that the large-n measure is simply, up to a normalization
constant, the partition function of the zp-projection of n = 1 supersymmetric ten-dimensional
u(k) gauge theory dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions. the ten-dimensional gauge eld
has

and the ten-dimensional majorana-weyl fermion has components

a = (cid:0)1a

n, ab(cid:1) ,

 = r 

2g (cid:0)1/2ma

 , 1/2 a(cid:1) .

the zp-projection acts as on the u(k)-valued variables as

{kq}a
{kq}ma

n1
 1

{kq} = a
{kq} = e2iqa/pma
 ,

n ,

{kq}ab1

{kq} = e2i(qa+qb)/pab ,
{kq} a1

{kq} = e2iqa/p a .

(4.9)

(4.10)

(4.11)

the partition function is then dened as the integral over the projected variables of the ten-
dimensional gauge theory with an action where all the derivative terms are set to zero:

z = zu(k);zp

d10a d16 en s(a,) ,

(4.12)

with

s(a, ) = 

1
2

trk [a, a]2 + n 1/2trk  [a, ] .

(4.13)

the result for the large-n measure when s5/zp is smooth is also the partition function
of the corresponding zp-projected gauge theory, but only for the appropriate charge sectors,
i.e. {k, . . . , k}, for type iib, and {k, k+, k, . . . , k+}, for type 0b. we consider the former case
rst.12 the arguments leading to this conclusion are more complicated because the maximally
degenerate saddle-point solution for ab is not simply proportional to the identity. below we
sketch the proof.

12the following analysis is also valid in the same charge sector when s5/zp has a singularity.

22

first of all, the maximally degenerate solution is

w 0 = 221[k][k] ,

n = xn1[k][k] , ab = 1 ab1[k][k] 
a

p

xq=1

eq qqaqb .

(4.14)

notice that ab, for qa + qb 6= 0, is o-diagonal. it is useful to introduce the notation sab
for the saddle-point solution for ab. for each of the quantities v  {a
n, ab} we dene the
following decomposition

v = v0 + v + v ,

(4.15)

where v0 is the saddle-point value of the variable, v are the components which do not commute
with at least one sab. the remaining variables v then commute with all the components sab.
explicitly this means that

v0 = v1[k][k] 

p

xq=1

eq q+r ,

v =

p

xq=1

v(q)
[k][k]  eq q+r ,

v = v(0)

[k][k] 

p

xq=1

eq q+r .

(4.16)

q=1 v(q)

[k][k] = 0 and trk v(0)

[k][k] = 0.

with pp

the complication in this case is that there are now uctuations that are lifted at gaussian

order.13 the relevant terms in the expansion of the eective action are

s(2) = trk [sa, a

n]2  4trk [sa, b]2 + 4trk[sa, a]2 .

(4.17)

so any uctuation in a
the expansion. these are precisely the variables a

n and a that does not commute with sb will be lifted at this order in

n and a in the decomposition (4.15).

actually, not quite all the uctuations a are lifted by (4.17) because there are exact at
directions of se generated by the action of the auxiliary u(k)      u(k) symmetry group
on the saddle-point solution. innitesimally, these are the variations

k

a = [sa, ] ,

(4.18)

where  = pp

q=1 (q)eq q are innitesimal parameters of the transformation. it is convenient to
a orthogonal to the variations

gauge-x this symmetry by integrating only over uctuations 
k
a. these uctuation can be specied by the conditions

or equivalently [ 

a , sa] = 0, hence the gauge-xed quadratic action is therefore

trk (cid:0) 

a [sa, ](cid:1) = 0 ,

 ,

s(2)
gf = trk [sa, a

n]2  4trk [sa, 

b ]2 .

13these are in addition to the uctuations w 0 that are lifted at this order: see [4].

23

(4.19)

(4.20)

now we come to the crux of the argument. in general there could be cubic interactions
that couple one tilded variable with one two hatted variables, i.e. schematically of the form
trk v1v2v3, that contribute at the same order in 1/n as the gaussian terms in (4.20) and
quartic terms in the hatted variables. however, because of the decompositions (4.16) such
couplings vanish. the quartic terms in the hatted variables follow in an identical way to the
n = 4 calculation [4]. finally, at leading order in 1/n the bosonic variables are controlled by
the gauge-xed action

sgf = trk [sa, a

n]2  4trk [sa, 

b ]2 

1
2

trk (cid:0)4[a

n, a

m]2 + 2[ a, a

n]2 + 4[ a, b]2(cid:1) . (4.21)

up to a terms which are sub-leading in 1/n, we can write this as a gauge xed version of the
action of the ten-dimensional gauge eld (4.9) as in (4.13). the point is that (4.21) diers from
(4.13) by (i) terms quadratic in tilded variables and quadratic in hatted variables (ii) quartic
in tilded variables. but both these kinds of term are sub-leading in 1/n. so in the resulting
partition function (4.12) some of the terms in the action are actually higher order in 1/n. a
similar result is follows in the {k, k+, k, . . . , k+} charge sector of the type 0b theories when
s5/zp/2 is smooth.

in retrospect we can see the relation between the general solution of the saddle-point
equations and the at directions of the gauge theory action (4.13). the point is that the
vanishing commutators in (4.4) are precisely the equations-of-motion of the gauge theory action.
in other words the space-of-solutions of the saddle-point equations is identical to the vacuum
moduli space of the matrix model. therefore the fact that the saddle-point solutions can be
identied with the moduli space of d-instantons is no accident. in the general case, the solutions
describe the possible fractionations of d-instantons at the singularity (s5/zp)sing. in the n = 4
case the integrals over the relative positions of the d-instantons are actually convergent and the
charge k d-instanton can be thought of as a bound-state. it would be interesting to investigate
the convergence of the integrals over the relative positions of the (fractional) d-instantons
in these more general theories. in particular, the convergence issue is crucial for nding the
n-dependence of the large-n instanton measure.

5. relation to n = 2 su(n ) gauge theory with nf = 2n

in the above we have considered the instanton contributions in the large-n limit to a class of
n = 2 theories with product group structure su(n)  su(n) (after decoupling the abelian
factors). in ref. [28] we considered the contributions of instantons in the large-n limit to the
n = 2 conformal theory with gauge group su(n) and with nf = 2n fundamental hyper-
multiplets. although apparently unconnected, the instanton contributions in these theories are

24

related in the following way. consider the charge sector {k, 0, . . . , 0} in the n = 2 supersym-
metric theories with gauge group su(n)   su(n). in this instanton background only the
su(n) gauge eld v(1)
n is non-zero, and consequently only the adjoint fermion elds (1)a, with
a = 1, 2, and adjoint scalar elds a(1)ab, with ab = 12, 34, along with the fermion elds (q)a,
with q = 1, p and a = 3, 4, and the scalar elds a(q)ab, with q = 1, p and ab = 13, 14, 23, 24,
which transform in either the n or n representations of the su(n) factor, are non-zero. these
elds amass into the an su(n) vector representation of n = 2 supersymmetry and 2n funda-
mental hypermultiplets; precisely the theory considered in ref. [28]. so the instantons in the
{k, 0, . . . , 0} charge sector of the rst theory should describe the charge k instantons of the
second theory.

now we are in a position to interpret the results of ref. [28] for the large-n instanton mea-
sure in the context of the results in this paper. in the charge sector {k, 0, . . . , 0} the large-n
instanton measure involves the partition function for the zp-projected n = 1 supersymmet-
ric u(k) gauge theory in ten-dimensions dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions, with zp
embedded in the gauge group as {k,0,... ,0} = 1[n][n] and in su(4)r as in (1.3). only the u(k)-
adjoint matrices (1)
and  (1) a, with a = 1, 2, survive this projection.
the resulting partition function can equally well be described as that of the n = (1, 0) su-
persymmetric u(k) theory in six dimensions dimensionally reduced to zero dimensions. this
is precisely the result of ref. [28]. in particular since from the orbifold perspective all the k
instantons are fractional we have a simple explanation of the observation that the saddle-point
solution of ref. [28] described a point-like object in ads5  s1: the s1 is precisely the orbifold
singularity of s5/zp on which the fractional d-instantons are conned to move.

ab, ab = 12, 34, m(1)a



6. discussion

in the n = 4 theories much more could be achieved [4] because the measure could be used
to calculate instanton contributions to particular correlation functions which could then be
compared with d-instanton induced terms in the type iib supergravity eective action [6]. in
this comparison the overall numerical pre-factor in the large-n adhm measure was crucial
to get the precise agreement found in [4]. for the orbifold theories we have not kept track of
the numerical pre-factor since it is not clear on the dual side what to compare with. in fact
a dual supergravity approximation of the string theory only exists if s5/zp is smooth, unless
the singularity is blown up in some way. it would clearly be interesting to attempt the more
detailed check of the duality carried through in [4].

appendix a:

in this appendix we prove that solutions to the saddle-point equations (4.4) for the type iib
dual cases when s5/zp is smooth only exist if all the kq all equal.

our proof proceeds along the following lines. since all the matrices ab commute they have
a basis of simultaneous eigenvectors. in order to show that there are no solutions to (4.4) unless
all the instanton numbers in each group factor are the same we will show that in the contrary
situation the matrices ab have at least one common null eigenvector and consequently (4.4)
cannot be satised because w 0 is non-degenerate.

consider, for the moment, one of the ab matrices, which we denote generically as a, with

the block form14

a =

p

xq=1

a(q)  eq qr .

(a.1)

since zp acts freely on s5 we have r 6= 0 mod p. in general, if r and p have some common
integer divisor(s) (the largest of which we denote c) zp does not act faithfully on a, rather only
the subgroup zp/c is realized.

the rst result we need, is that any non-null eigenvector of a has the form

v =

p/c

xq=1

v(rq+s)  erq+s ,

(a.2)

where all the components v(rq+s), q = 1, . . . , p/c, are all non-vanishing. to see this consider
the eigenvalue equation in the block-form basis:

a(r+s)v(s) = v(r+s) .

(a.3)

14it is useful to introduce a basis of vectors to match the block-form of the matrices. to this end we dene the
p-dimensional column vector eq with a 1 in the qth position and 0 elsewhere. these vectors have the property
eq res = eqrs.

26

iterating this equation p/c times we cycle back to yield an eigenvector equation for v(s):

a(rp/c+s)    a(r+s)v(s) = p/cv(s) .

(a.4)

denoting the eigenvalue as , we have  = c/p. this means that each non-null eigenvector
of a(rp/c+s)    a(r+s) gives rise to p/c non-null eigenvectors of a itself, the multiplicity arising
from the p/c choices of the roots of  = c/p. the non-null eigenvectors of a are consequently
of the form

v =

p/c

xq=1

cq/pa(rq+s)    a(r+s)v(s)  erq+s .

(a.5)

as stated, the non-null eigenvectors have the form (a.2) where all the components v(rq+s),
q = 1, . . . , p/c, are all non-vanishing.

the fact that the non-null eigenvectors have the form (a.2) implies that all the remaining

eigenvectors must be null. the null eigenvectors can therefore be written as

with no sum on q. a lower bound on the number of null eigenvectors of the form (a.6) is
consequently

v(q)  eq ,

(a.6)

d(r, q) = kq  kmin(r, q) ,

(a.7)

where kmin(r, q) is the smallest number in the set {kq+nr, n = 1, . . . , p/c}.

we now denote the rst matrix as a1, with associated quantities r1 and c1, and introduce

a second matrix a2 of the same form:

a2 =

p

xq=1

a(q)
2  eq qr2

(a.8)

that commutes with a1. we now proceed to establish a lower bound on the number of simul-
taneous null eigenvectors of a1 and a2. the point is that certain linear combinations of null
eigenvectors of a1 of the form can be non-null eigenvectors of a2, and vice-versa. we must
enumerate the maximum possible such combinations that can arise to establish a lower bound
on the simultaneous null eigenvectors of a1 and a2. consider the null eigenvectors of a1 of the
form (a.6). a combination of such null eigenvectors of the form

v(q)  eq + v(q+r2)  eq+r2 +    + v(q+(p/c21)r2)  eq+(p/c21)r2 ,

(a.9)

can be a non-null eigenvector of a2. the number of such combinations that have this property
is clearly bounded above by

min(cid:0)d(r1, q), d(r1, q + r2), . . . , d(r1, q + (p/c2  1)r2)(cid:1) .

(a.10)

27

hence a lower bound on the number of simultaneous null eigenvectors of the form v(q)  eq is
given by

d(r1, q)min(cid:0)d(r1, q), . . . , d(r1, q + (p/c2  1)r2)(cid:1)

= max(cid:0)0, d(r1, q)  d(r1, q + r2), . . . , d(r1, q)  d(r1, q + (p/c2  1)r2)(cid:1)

however, we can also run the argument the other way and consider the null eigenvectors of a2
that can be non-null eigenvectors of a1. taken together this gives a lower bound xq on the
number of simultaneous null eigenvectors of a1 and a2 of the form v(q)  eq
xq = max(cid:0)d(r1, q)  d(r1, q + n2r2), d(r2, q)  d(r2, q + n1r1)(cid:1) .

the expression above is written in short-hand where the integers run over the values n1,2 =
0, . . . , p/c1,2  1.

(a.12)

(a.11)

it is now easy to introduce a third matrix a3 and establish a lower bound on the simulta-
neous null eigenvectors of all three matrices. the idea is to consider the maximum number of
simultaneous null eigenvectors of a1 and a2 that can be non-null eigenvectors of a3. for null
eigenvectors of the form v(q)  eq, this number is bounded above by

min(cid:0)xq, xq+r3, . . . , xq+(p/c31)r3(cid:1) .

hence a lower bound on the number of simultaneous null eigenvectors of a1, a2 and a3 of the
form v(q)  eq is given by

(a.13)

(a.14)

max(cid:0)0, xq  xq+r3, . . . , xq  xq+(p/c31)r3(cid:1) .

this establishes a lower bound on the number of simultaneous null eigenvectors of all three
matrices. the most stringent bound is then obtained by considering all three permutations of
this line of reasoning. putting all this together, one nds a lower bound

max(cid:0)d(ra, q)  d(ra, q + nbrb)  d(ra, q + ncrc) + d(ra, q + nbrb + ncrc)(cid:1)

on the number of simultaneous null eigenvectors, where a, b, c run over the 6 permutations of
1, 2, 3, and the integers na = 0, . . . , p/ca  1.

(a.15)

using the equations (4.4) for ab and the reality condition (3.6), the last equation in (4.4)

can be written as


1212 + 

1313 + 

1414 = 1

4(w 0)1 .

(a.16)

if 12, 13 and 14 have a simultaneous null eigenvector then there can be no solution to this
equation since w 0 is non-degenerate but (a.15), with r1 = q1 + q2, r2 = q1 + q3 and r3 = q1 + q4,
gives a lower bound on the number of such null eigenvectors; hence for a solution (a.16) to
exist, it is necessary that for each q and permutation of a, b, c

d(ra, q)  d(ra, q + nbrb)  d(ra, q + ncrc) + d(ra, q + nbrb + ncrc)  0 .

(a.17)
the only way this set of inequalities can be satised is if d(ra, q + ncrc)  d(ra, q + nbrb + ncrc)
is independent of nc which further requires that all the kq have to be equal. qed.
