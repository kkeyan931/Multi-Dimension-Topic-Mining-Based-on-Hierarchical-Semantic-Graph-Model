abstract

a magnetic monopole is placed at the centre of a ball whose surface
s2 is tiled by the symmetry group, , of a regular solid. the quantum
mechanics on the two-dimensional quotient s2/ is developed and the
monopole charge is found to be quantised in an expected manner. the
heat-kernel and functions are evaluated and the casimir energy is
computed. numerical approaches to the calculation of the derivative
of the barnes function are presented.

1. introduction

in previous work, [1], we have discussed quantum eld theory on orbifold factors
of spheres sn/ where  is a discrete subgroup of the orthogonal group, o(n + 1).
in this paper we wish to present an extension in the two-dimensional case (n = 2)
to the situation where there is a uniform radial magnetic eld passing through
the surface of the sphere. this can be thought of as due to a magnetic monopole
at the centre of a ball in an embedding r3. the motivation is partly to investi-
gate the interplay between a magnetic eld and a non-trivial topology/geometry
induced by identication. specically we would be interested in what happens to
the dirac quantization in topologically interesting or singular manifolds (orbifolds).
there is also continuing statistical mechanical interest in magnetic elds and two-
dimensional domains.

the quotient group is the complete symmetry group of a regular solid and can
be generated by reections in the three (concurrent) planes of symmetry of the solid.
the elements fall into two sets depending on whether they contain an even or an
odd number of relections. the even subset forms the rotational subgroup denoted
1. if  is any xed element
now by   so(3). the odd subset is denoted by 
1. in particular we can choose  = 
of  then as  runs over ,  exhausts 
where  is a reection in a symmetry plane and so the complete group is

 =   

1 =   .

(1)

the standard classication of nite subgroups (reection groups) is given by
meyer, [2], and we use his notation. the general construction of the quotients,
s2/, which in this case are certain geodesic triangles on s2 is sketched later.
the vertices of these triangles are singular points. joining them to the origin of
the ambient r3 produces singular strings and our analysis can be extended to this
three-dimensional setting [3]. the two-dimensional models that we study can be
thought of as toy models for more general textures in higher dimensions as laid
down by kibble, [see e.g. [4]).

our main interest is in setting up the general framework and then applying it
to some specic calculations such as the evaluation of vacuum energies. this will
involve a certain amount of technical manipulation, especially with the properties
of the barnes function. this function appears quite commonly, particularly in
spherically symmetric situations and in the presence of magnetic elds or harmonic
oscillators and we expect that our methods will have an applicability beyond the
immediate one here.

a very brief summary of our ndings is given in section 12.

2. modes and group actions on the full sphere.

as modes on the full sphere, we can take the angular part of the schrodinger
equation solutions derived long ago by tamm [5] and fierz [6]. it would be more rig-
orous to use a bre bundle formulation (greub and petry [7] , wu and yang [8]) or
geometric quantisation [9,10] but this is unnecessary for our purposes. for denite-
ness, we employ the modes denoted by (yqm)a in wu and yang, corresponding to the
string running down the negative zaxis. the modes are, up to normalisation, the
su(2) representation matrices d(l)
m,q(, , ) with l = |q|, |q + 1| . . . , l  m  l
[11]). 2q is the monopole number with q  eg/h, and 2q  z. if the string runs up
the positive z-axis, the modes are d(l)

the corresponding eigenvalues of hs2 , the angular part of (  iea)2, are

m,q(, , ).

l = l(l + 1)  q2 =(cid:18)l +

4  q2



(2)

with degeneracy 2l + 1.

it is helpful to give the explicit form of the angular eigenfunctions in spherical

polar coordinates,

qm(, ) = nqlm sin|q+m|(/2) cos|qm|(/2)p |q+m|,|qm|
y (l)

l(|q+m|+|qm|)/2(cos )ei(q+m)

(3)
where nqlm is a normalisation constant and the p ,
n (x) are jacobi polynomials. in
the wu-yang formalism these are the solutions (sections) in the upper hemisphere.
in the lower hemisphere the potential is taken to have a string along the positive
z-axis. the two sets of solutions are related on the equator by the factor exp(i2q).
making this single valued gives the quantisation condition on q, in this approach.
the basic means of nding the modes is to write hs2  =  explicitly as a

dierential equation in spherical polar coordinates,

m is given by

l = u +

2(cid:0)|q + m| + |q  m|(cid:1),

v = m  q

(5)

and thus it would appear that we could have any value of q as long as u and v are
integers (with suitable l, m  r). however, in this case the solutions would not be
single-valued and all the solutions would vanish on the string axis. setting 2q  z
gives the same values of l and m as before.

as usual, when one tries to adapt wave-functions to some symmetry (here )
there is the problem that the magnetic potential, a, might not possess the same
symmetry so that compensating gauge transformations are necessary. peierls, [12],
calls this process umeichen. it is a well known situation, with extensive discus-
sion,[13], which we have encountered in an earlier calculation on the tetrahedron,
[14], an orbifold factor of the plane. a similar procedure has also been applied to
factors of the poincare half-plane.

in the present case, under the action of , the string is rotated and reected
and has to be brought back to its original position if we are to implement the iden-
tication in s2/ consistently. the equation that contains the relevant information
is the behaviour of the modes under arbitrary rotations-reections. for the moment
we deal with the easier, pure rotational case, g  so(3). then the behaviour is an
elementary consequence of the su(2) group combination law and one has explicitly
(wu and yang [8], frenkel and hrasko [15])

y (l)

qm(g1br) = eiqg(r) y (l)

qm(br)d(l)

mm(g),

g  so(3) .

the exponential factor is the compensating gauge rotation with

(6)

(7)

g(br) = (g) + (g)  g

where ,  and  are the euler angles of the rotation g and g is the solid angle
subtended by the geodesic triangle on the (unit) sphere cut out by r, the string
axis, n, (here the negative z-axis) and the rotated string axis, gn,

g(br) = (gn, n; r),

r = (br, r).

(our conventions regarding rotations and actions are generally those of brink and
satchler [16].)the gradient of  gives the gauge transformation between the poten-
tials of the two strings.

an alternative expression for  is (wu and yang [8])

g(br) = g    ag

where ag is the angle at br in the above mentioned triangle on s2 and g1br =

in order that (6) be consistently iterated, it is necessary that the group com-

(g, g)

bination (cocycle) condition,

gh(br) = g(br) + h(g1br),

should hold, and this can be checked directly from (7). the geometrical details are
to be found in the useful article by frenkel and hrasko [15].

the magnetic rotation operator, tg, is dened, on scalars, by the action

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

or, equivalently,

(tg)(r) = eiqg(br ) (g1r),
hr | tg = eiqg(br ) hg1r | .

in the present spherical case, because of (9), the magnetic rotations provide a true,
as opposed to a ray, representation of the double of so(3) (denoted so(3)) in the
sense that

and

tgh = tg th

te = (1)2q1 ,

(12)

where e is a 2 rotation. this is not unexpected considering that for q a half
odd-integer all the monopole harmonics have half odd-integer angular momentum.
so(3) is isomorphic to su(2).

magnetic rotations on the plane [17] also provide true representations but not

so translations, unless the ux through a fundamental domain is quantised [18].

we record the action of tg on the modes which is easily obtained from (10)

and (6),

tgy (l)

qm(br) = y (l)

qm(br)d(l)

mm(g).

(13)

3. parity and reections.

the singularity (string) preserving magnetic parity operator on monopole wave-

functions is dened by the action, [15],

()(r) = eiq(n,n;r) (r)

under the inversion  : r  r

on the modes we have, as an easy calculation shows,

y (l)

qm = (1)l y (l)
qm.

(14),

(15)

the parity operator can be used to extend the magnetic rotation operator t
to include reections. the reection, , in the plane with normal t can be written
as a rotation through  about the axis t combined with the parity inversion . this
can be written as  = g  =  g. the extension of t to reections is thus dened
by

t = tg

 = t tg

 =  tg

.

from (10) and (14)

and on the modes,

(t)(r) = eiq(r)+iq (rg

)(r),

(ty (l)

qm)(br) = (1)l y (l)

qm(br)d(l)

mm(g).

(16)

(17)

4. construction of the domains s2/

it is convenient now to formalize briey what we mean by the space s2/
where  is a nite subgroup of o(3). a region of the sphere f  s2 is called a
fundamental domain for  if it satises the following criteria,

    {id},

(i) f is open in s2 ,
(ii) ft f = ,
(iii) s2 =s f.
physically, fs f represents the space on which our theory is dened, and all

the copies of f on s2 must be physically equivalent.

we also assume that f is connected.

5

the space s2/ is the the sphere s2 with the points r and r identied for all
  . if  acts freely on s2, i.e. there are no xed points, then s2/ is closed
and can be taken to be f with identied boundary. if there are xed points, these
will be contained in f and can be considered as boundary singular points of s2/.
when  is purely rotational the xed points form a discrete set of which there
are two, or three, in f . for the extended, reection groups, as already indicated,
the boundary f is constructed from the intersections of two or three reection
planes with the sphere. thus there are transformations that map f into adjacent
domains and which leave part of the boundary of f xed. the conclusion here
is that, unlike the rotational case, the boundary f is a real boundary and the
physical manifold is termed a mobius triangle.

5. projection to s2/

still restricting to purely rotational , we will now formally project everything

down to s2/ in a more or less standard fashion.

necessary that it satisfy the magnetic periodicity condition

in order that a function e(r) on s2 project down consistently to s2/, it is

where a(g) forms a one-dimensional representation of , the double of , and

is a minimal choice for a(g).

labels the projection. for ease we have put r in place ofbr. we show later that there

if q is integral, there is no need to introduce the group doubles. however, if
one does, there is a simple duplication, which is easily dealt with in practice as we
can show with the following, somewhat superuous, constructions.

since the action of  covers the sphere s2 twice, we introduce the trivial double

covering, s2, of two identical copies of s2, with s2/ = s2/.

the modes themselves do not change sign on a 2 rotation, even when l is half
odd-integral, and neither does the wavefunction. so (r) = (er), where e is a

2 rotation, and therefore, e(r) = (r).

numerical equality

we then have, somewhat non-rigorously, for the function, (r), on s2/ the

(r) = (r)

(19)

where we do not distinguish between the projected and original coordinates, both
being denoted by r. the r on the right belongs to the fundamental domain of 

6

tge(r) = a(g)e(r),

g  ,

(18)

on s2, which is, of course, isomorphic to that of  on s2. then

tg(r) = a(g)(r).

the heat-kernel on s2, written in mode form,

ks2(cid:0)r, r; (cid:1) =

xl=|q|

el trhy(l)

q (r)y(l)q

(r)i ,

(20)

(21)

propagates arbitrary wavefunctions on s2 and satises the important switching
relation

ks(cid:0)r, g1r; (cid:1) = eiqg(r

)iqg1 (r) ks(cid:0)gr, r; (cid:1)

which realises in coordinate representation the operator rotational symmetry

tgks2 = ks2 tg

(see (11)).

the heat-kernel that propagates wavefunctions on s2/ obeying (20) is, by

general theory,

ks2 /(r, r) = xg

a(g) tg1 ks2 (r, r)

(22)

which is referred to as the pre-image form of this propagator in terms of that on
s2.

the double group  can be decomposed

 =   e

and the sum over  reduced to a sum over the subset 

ks2 / (r, r) =xg(cid:0)a(g) tg1 + a(eg) t(eg)1(cid:1) ks2  (r, r).

(23)

we know, (12), that te = (1)2q1 and so from (20), a(e) = (1)2q. hence
a(e) te = 1 and so

ks2 / (r, r) = 2xg

a(g) tg1 ks2 (r, r),

(24)

which means we can nally write what was almost obvious from the start, the
preimage sum,

ks2/(r, r) =xg

a(g) tg1 ks2(r, r).

(25)

(27)

(28)

the factor of 2 is a normalization (volume) factor between s2 and s2, ks2  = 2ks2.
this result shows that we can eectively ignore the complication of the double

group and just proceed with  as usual.

(19), a eld on s2/ is constructed by the projection

given an arbitrary eld e(r) on s2, a quasi-periodic eld on s2 and hence, via

in particular the projected (i.e. adapted) modes are

y (l)
qm (r) =

where, using (13),

p||xg

pmm =

is a hermitian projection matrix, p 2 = p . since the eigenvalues of p are 0 and 1,
this shows that in a suitable, i.e. diagonal, basis the projected eigenfunctions are
a subset of the unprojected ones, a general result and independent of the magnetic
eld.

depending on whether q and l are integral or half odd-integral together, the
representations a and d of the doubled elements, e, have the same or opposite
sign as those of  and we can see explicitly that it is adequate to restrict the sum
in (28) to , as we have done.

let us pursue this a little further to make sure everything is satisfactory. it
is much more elegant to express everything in abstract form but we will retain the
coordinate representation. the discussion is a textbook one in applied group theory.

from (27, using periodicity, one easily derives the integral

zs2/

qm (r)y (l)
y (l)

qm (r)dr = pmm.

diagonalising a, a = u du 1, introduces the linear combinations y ()u ,

which, from (27) equals p|| y u d showing that certain linear combinations of

the modes on s2 vanish and others do not, after adaptation which takes on the
nature of a ltering process. we write for the nonzero combinations

q =p|| y (l)
y (l)

qmum

8

(29)

which form a complete, orthogonal set on s2/.

the factors ofp|| have been chosen to give suitably normalised eigenfunctions

on s2/ so that

ks2/(cid:0)r, r; (cid:1) =

xl=|q|

el trhy (l)

q (r)y (l)q

(r)i .

(30)

the matrix u reduces the l-representation of  into irreducible ones and, from
(28), the range of , i.e. the degeneracy, is the number of times the irreducible a-
representation occurs in this decomposition.

5. eect of xed points

the standard theory of coverings applies when the covering group acts freely.
this is not so in the present case and the result is a singular space  an orbifold.
we can still maintain the standard covering terminology, as we already have done
when referring to fundamental domains, in an obvious way by rstly removing the
xed points, so that the standard theory applies, and then extending the action of
the covering group, , to these points.

we now investigate the implications of the periodicity condition (18) when
extended to the xed point set of . for any    there are two xed points on the
sphere, r . going back to the mathematical result (6), we see that the monopole
modes on the full sphere satisfy the identity

y (l)
qm(r) = eiq (r

 ) y (l)

qm(r )d(l)

mm(),

(31)

where  is the rotation about r , obviously.

using the relation (29) we can determine the action of the magnetic rotation

operator t on the y,

ty(r) =p|| (ty )(r)u = eiq (r)p|| y (1r)u = eiq (r)y(1r)

as expected. however we also have, from (27),

and therefore

ty(r) = a()y(r)

eiq (r)y(1r) = a()y(r)

9

and of course

eiq (r)(1r) = a()(r).

if there were no xed points there would be no problem to discuss. however if

r = r is xed by  we have the consistency condition

eiq (r
eiq (r

 )(r) = a()(r)
 )y(r) = a()y(r)

(32)

this says that the phase is undetermined at the xed points. if the xed point
is removed there is no problem. we are then eectively working arbitrarily close
to the xed point and all the points r,   , belong to dierent images of the
fundamental domain. when the xed point is put back and the limit r  r taken,
all these images coalesce and the phase becomes indeterminate, unless something
special happens such as eiq (r
 ) equalling a() or if the wave function has a node
at r. we analyse this situation further.

since  can be generated by a set of cyclic rotations, it is helpful rstly to take
the case when  is cyclic, ck, about the z-axis. everything in (28) is then explicit.

let the generator of ck beb, (b  = 1). also let the generator of the double group

z be  with () = e and ()2 = 1. e is the 2 doubling rotation.

the representations a(g) are

a(cid:0)()p(cid:1) = e2ipr/,

p = 0, 1, . . . , 2  1,

(33)

where, for integral q, the label r, is in the range 0 to 1, while for half-odd integral
q, r = (2s + 1)/2 with 0  s    1.

d(l)
mm(g) is diagonal

mm(cid:0)()p(cid:1) = e2ipm/ mm , l  m, m  l,
d(l)

and pmm is easily found,

pmm =

1


1  e2i(m+r)
1  e2i(m+r)/ mm.

(34)

(35)

this expression vanishes unless m + r is 0 mod , in which case it equals unity
making the ltering obvious.

it is comforting to check things by looking at the explicit forms of some modes.
m are ordinary spherical harmonics. at the north pole only

for q = 0, the modes y (l)

10

the m = 0 component survives which then forces r to be zero and (32) is trivially
satised since a() = 1.

one can proceed generally but let us use the modes exhibited in wu and yang
section 7. for q = 1/2 we see that only the m = 1/2 survives at the north pole
making r = 1/2 and now to check (32) we need the expression for . for a rotation
through  about the z-axis, from (7) or (8),  = , and again the check works.
for q = 1, the nonzero mode corresponds to r = 1.

in general one nds that r = q and looking at the  dependence of the modes,

y (l)
by 2/ and so, therefore, is the wave function.

mq, (3), i.e. exp(cid:0)i(m+q)(cid:1), we see that the modes y (l) are periodic as  increases

it should be noted that if (8) is used, the azimuthal angle of the north pole
changes by  even though it is a xed point. the strings location may be un-
changed, but a nonzero compensating gauge transformation is still required.

it is clear geometrically that the same results will hold if ck is cyclic about

any axis so that it is consistent to set

a() = eiq (r

 ),

(36)

for any . the consequence of replacing r by r is discussed in the next section.
the minimal choice (36) clearly corresponds to untwisted elds in the sense

that the more general form

a() = eiq (r

 ) b(),

(37)

where b() is some nontrivial representation of , encodes physics over and above
the magnetic monopole, such as aharonov-bohm uxes through the xed points.
in this latter case, (18) implies that the wavefunction vanishes at the xed points.

6. charge quantisation on rotational domains.

we now have expressions for the modes and heat-kernel on s2/ in the ro-
tational case and have tacitly assumed that all integer values of 2q are allowed.
however 2q need only form a subset of the integers. a geometric, dirac type argu-
ment will rstly be used to calculate this subset.

choose a fundamental domain f which does not contain the string. let l  f

be a piecewise continuous loop in f and construct the parallel propagator,

i[l] = eierl

11

a = eiq,

(38)

where a is the potential one-form,  is the area within l. this follows from the
explicit form of the monopole potential. as l shrinks to a point in f , i[l] clearly
tends to unity as the area vanishes. now l also describes a loop with (oriented)
area (|f|  ) in s2/, since s2/ is closed for rotational  (except for the xed
points which we can ignore for these purposes as a set of measure zero). thus if we
let l expand to ll the boundary f  s2, the propagator will also take the value
1. this requires that q|f| be a multiple of 2 which gives the possible values of the
magnetic charge as

n
2

q = ||

, n  z,

(39)

the expected value since the magnetic charge per closed domain, q  q/||, equals
the dirac value, n/2.

if the string passes through f there is an extra phase 4q in (38) which makes

no dierence to the nal result.

for the cyclic group, ck, according to (33), and (36),

a(p) = e2ipq/ = (1)np

(40)

so all the a() are 1.

a further restriction occurs if ck is a subgroup of a point group , for then

a() = ei||n/k,

but, by observation, for a noncyclic point group, all ||/k are even and the a()
are unity. furthermore the monopole charge q is integral and there are no spinor
modes.

the quantisation (39) or (36), will now be derived in another way. the con-
sistency condition (32) must hold for both xed points of . geometry shows, if
orientation eects are taken correctly into account, that (r) =  (r). this
also follows from the mode transformation (31) and the behaviour under parity
(14), which involves q  q.

the two denitions of a() require

q =

k
2

n

(41)

for some integer n, where k is the order of the cyclic subgroup generated by .
since (r) = 2/n, all the a() are 1.

if  is not cyclic, the minimum requirement of (41) is q = (k/2)p where p  z
and k is the lcm of all the n. looking at the character tables of the double

12

point groups it is easily checked that it is not possible to reconcile the tabulated
1 representations a() with (41) unless all the a() are unity, implying that p is
even or q = (2k/2)p for p  z. but 2k is nothing but the group order  leading
to (39) for all n. qed.

7. integrated kernels and zeta functions

special interest attaches itself to the integrated kernel,

k( ) zs2/

ks2/(cid:0)r, r; (cid:1) dr =xg
a(g)zs2(cid:0)tg1 ks2(cid:1)(cid:0)r, r; (cid:1) dr.
||xg

1

=

a(g)zs2/(cid:0)tg1ks2(cid:1)(cid:0)r, r; (cid:1) dr

(42)

it is convenient to write everything in terms of the covering s2 quantities because
we can use the mode form (21) in (42) to obtain

with

d(l) =

a(g)(l)(g1) ,

k( ) =

d(l) el

xl=|q|
||xg

1

(43)

(44)

(45)

where we have used the orthogonality of the s2 monopole modes and (l)(g) is the
usual so(3)  su(2) character of g. in particular

zs2

tr(cid:2)(cid:0)tgyql(cid:1)(r)y

ql(r)(cid:3) dr = l(g).

algebraically we can see that the degeneracy, d(l), is the number of times the
irreducible representation a occurs in the l-representation. since degeneracies are
real, a(g) in (44) and in the following equations, can be replaced by its real part,
re a(g), although in the present case the minimal a(g) = 1.

(44) shows that the summand in d(l), is a class function so that we can make a
convenient geometrical decomposition of the traced kernel, as in our earlier work [1].
the preimage sum, i.e. the sum over , is rstly replaced by a sum over conjugacy
classes, {g},

d(l) =

2l + 1
||

+

1

||x{g}

a(g)|{g}| (l)(g)

13

with g being a typical element in {g}.

we now recall that the elements of a class correspond to rotations through
one xed angle about a set of conjugate axes. for a given set of such axes, one
corresponding class can be considered to be the primitive class, all others associated
with these axes then being generated by this one. thus the sum over all classes
can be rewritten as a sum over primitive classes and powers of these. let k be the

generic order of the rotation associated with the generic primitive class {bg} so that
bgk = id. then |{bg}| is just the number, nk, of conjugate k-fold axes and we can

write

1

(46)

d(l) =

2l + 1
||

+

nk

k1xp=1

||x
bg

ap(bg) (l)(bgp)

which is the same as when there is no magnetic eld, apart from the restriction
l  |q| and one sees again, cf , that the cyclic groups, ck, form the basic building
blocks. this can be made explicit as follows. in the case that  is just ck, one has
from (46)

dk(l) =

where d1(l) = 2l + 1 is the full sphere degeneracy.

having now the degeneracies and the eigenvalues, we can turn to the explicit
construction of the integrated heat-kernel (43) and its mellin transform, the 
function,

(s) =xl

d(l)
s
l

.

(49)

the eigenvalues are given by (2) and we face the old problem of computing
spherical spectral quantities. we will approach this by rstly looking at a linearised
system, one whose eigenvalues are l + 1/2. the corresponding heat-kernel, denoted
and
will allow us to nd the function for the eigenvalues (l + 1/2)2 quickly and that
for the l of (2), more elaborately. the expressions are also of some statistical
mechanical interest if  is interpreted as an inverse temperature.

ek( ), can be considered as that for the pseudo-operator(cid:0)hs2 + 1/4 + q2(cid:1)1/2

14

from (43), we have the linearised, or square root, kernel

with degeneracies given by (44).

ek( ) =

xl=|q|

d(l)e(l+1/2)

(50)

in accordance with (48), it is sucient to consider the cyclic group case, kk( )

and k(s).

since the cyclic axis is immaterial, we choose it to lie along the z-axis and could
use the expressions in the previous section since dk(l) is tr p, where p is given by
(35) with r = q. therefore

(51)

ekk( ) =

the summations can be relabelled using (5) and performed, but it is perhaps more
elegant to substitute (44) into (43) and do the l-summation rst, as in [1].

remembering the charge quantisation condition, (40), the degeneracies are

dk(l, q) =

1
k

k1xp=0

sin(cid:0)(2l + 1)p/k)
sin(p/k(cid:1)

,

q = nk/2,

(52)

where n is even or odd. if n is even, the degeneracies are identical to the case when
q = 0, dk(l, q) = dk(l, 0).

we now introduce the generating function

hk(, q) =

dk(l, q) l

(53)

xl=|q|

closely connected with the traced heat-kernel, (43), if  = e . for n even the only
eect of the monopole is to make the series start at l = |q|. however it is better to
continue with the summations. we have, for both integral and half odd-integral q,

hk(, q) =

the decomposition into conjugacy classes, (48), shows that this relation will

follow through for all groups ,

where q is the charge per domain and ek( ) has been determined in [1],

cosh(d0 /2)

.

here d0, d1 and d2 are integer invariants associated with the reection group having
 as its rotation subgroup.

the zeta function corresponding to the linear heat kernel is easily determined
as the mellin transform of (57). in fact we shall nd it more useful to consider the
slightly more general zeta function dened by,

 q

( )d

= 2(s, a + q|d1, d2) + 2(s, a + q + d0|d1, d2) + qh(s, a + q),

where h is the hurwitz zeta function, and 2 is the two-dimensional barnes zeta
function dened for s > 2 by, [19],

2(s, a|d1, d2) =

xn1,n2=0

1

(cid:0)a + n1d1 + n2d2(cid:1)s .

h is actually a one-dimensional barnes function.

to conclude this section we shall present some properties of the barnes zeta

function needed later.

the function 2(s, a|d1, d2) has simple poles at s = 1, 2 whose residues can be

written in terms of generalised bernoulli polynomials

res sr2(s, a|d1, d2) =

(1)r

b(2)
2r(a|d1, d2)

(60)

16

for r = 1, 2. here we have used the more standard notation as in erdelyi [20].
the values of the barnes function at negative integers are also given in terms of
generalised bernoulli polynomials. for n  z+ we have,
b(2)
2+n(a|d1, d2).

2(n, a|d1, d2) =

(n + 1)(n + 2)d1d2

8. extension to reection groups

before showing how to deal with the eigenvalues (2), we extend the analysis
to orbifolds s2/ where  is a nite reection group  the complete symmetry
group of a regular solid as outlined in section 1. the domain of interest is a mobius
triangle on s2.

as shown in section 3, under reection, the magnetic charge, q, changes sign
and the projection has to take this into account. the rotational projection is given
by (22) and (27) and all that is necessary is to combine this with the group decom-
position (1). we start by writing down the projected modes

w (l)

qm(r) = y (l)

qm (r) + a()ty (l)

qm(r),

(64)

where  is a reection, say in one of the symmetry planes, so that a() = 1. we
can choose either sign.

note the extended periodicity condition

t  w (l)

qm(r) = a()a()w (l)

qm(r),

 = .

17

which shows that the wavefunction on the domain f has monopole charge q if
that on f has charge q.

the group decomposition of  gives

s2 =(cid:18)[
= [

f(cid:19) (cid:18) [ 

1

f(cid:19)

(1 + )f,

and we see that the only possible theory using images requires that adjacent domains
on the sphere have opposite numerical monopole charge. the charge is q on f
and q on f for all   ,   
1.

for the theory to be consistent, we must at least show that the fundamental
domains with charge q and q dene equivalent physical theories. there are two
points. the rst is that the sign of the charge is arbitrary, being essentially a matter
of denition for the observer. the second point is that any physically signicant
quantities will depend only on f f   q2. our theory therefore has the possibility
of being consistent and we now derive the values of q for which it is consistent.

across the boundaries of the fundamental domains we have b  b and
a  a. for consistency we should dene these vector quantities to vanish on
the reecting boundaries. consider now the parallel propagator, (38), where the
loop l  f . since we have dened a to vanish on f we have i[f ] = 1. thus
for an arbitrary loop approaching the boundary we require trivial parallel transport
just as in the pure rotational case. this gives the possible values of q as

q = ||

n
2

= ||n, n  z,

(65)

so q is integral and there are no spinor modes.

the existence of xed points imposes certain conditions. the situation is more
restricting than in the pure rotational case because the xed points form a contin-
uous set, the boundary of our domain, f . let  be a reection (2 = 1). the xed
point set, p, is the intersection of the reecting plane with the s2 i.e. a great circle.
extending the periodicity condition (18) to  we see that  would have to satisfy

eiq(r)+iq(r) = a()(r),

 r  p.

(66)

since (r) is not constant on p, this equation cannot be satised on all of p unless
one of q = 0, |p = 0, n  p or n  p is true. applying this argument to the two,

18

or three, reection generators removes the last two possibilities and we are left with
either q = 0 or |p = 0 (or both).

the fact that the magnetic charge, q, has to be of opposite sign on adjacent
domains under the action of  for the image method to work indicates, crudely,
that q is zero on the boundary and suggests that our construction satises the
restrictions following from (66).

developing this nonrigorous analysis, since the magnetic eld b vanishes on
the reecting boundaries we must insist that the monopole modes take the value
w (l)
0m on the boundaries. thus the consistency equation (66) is satised. let  be
an arbitary rotation in . the rotational consistency (32) is satised for all  since
q is an integer multiple of || and, as already stated, a() = 1, . it would thus
appear that all the values of q in (65) produce a consistent theory.

for clarity we restate that the mode labelled by qlm takes the values

w (l)
qm on f
w (l)
qm on 
1f
w (l)
0m on (f )  (

1f ).

(67)

the modes (64) can be used to dene a heat-kernel analogous to the rotational

case. we skip straight to the linear heat-kernel which may be written

 ( ) =zs 2/
ek q

xl=q

e(l+1/2) tr(cid:2)w(l)

q (r)w(l)

q

(r)(cid:3)dr.

here w(l)
q

is the vector of solutions w (l)

qm. we can extend this integral to all
s2 just as we did in equation (42), in the rotational case (this is not entirely trivial
but it is possible using the invariance of the theory under q  q),

1

||zs 2

xl=q

 ( ) =

ek q

e(l+1/2) tr(cid:2)w(l)

q (r)w(l)

q

(r)(cid:3)dr.

the next step is to the use the explicit rotational modes (27) or (29) (with a(g) = 1),
equations (13) and (17), and the invariance of the heat kernel under charge reversal.
the result is,

 ( ) =

xl=q

19

this equation actually represents two heat kernels for the cases a() = 1.
for a() = 1 we shall use the term dirichlet and write k q
d( ). for a() = +1
we use the term neumann and write k q
n ( ). these names are used in analogy
to the case with no monopole eld, q = 0. in this case w (l)
0 m is, by construction,
a solution on the whole sphere (see (67)) and must satisfy t  w (l)
0 m = a()w (l)
0 m
everywhere. on the reecting boundaries, a() = 1 requires w (l)
0 m to vanish i.e.
dirichlet boundary conditions, and a() = +1 requires the normal derivative of
w (l)

0 m to vanish, i.e. neumann boundary conditions.

we now turn to some specic calculations of the heat kernels. using (45) we

can write the second term in (68) as,

a()

|| zs 2

xl=q x 1

l()e(l+1/2) .

(69)

our rst calculation is for the reection group  with rotational subgroup ck. in
this case 
1 consists of k reection planes with a common invariant axis, and with
angle 2/k between adjacent planes. if we take one plane to be the z x plane then
1 = {g p|p = 0, 1, 2, . . . , k  1} where  is parity, g is a rotation
we can write 
by angle  about the y axis, and  is a rotation by angle 2/k about the z-axis.
using the explicit result

d(l)

mm(g) = (1)lmm

m

(70)

and equations (15), (34) we nd l() = 1 for all   
trivial to calculate in this case, and from (68), (55) we nd

1 and all l. thus (69) is

d( ) = eq

the rst term in each of these expressions is simply exp(q ) times the monopole-
less heat kernel [1]. notice that the extra monopole contribution is the same in
both heat kernels.

we can also calculate the heat kernels for the group  with dihedral rotational
subgroup dk. we take 
1 as dk where  is a reection in the x y plane, and dk
is the dihedral group with the k-fold cyclic group about the z axis, and a rotation
by  about the y axis. using (34) and (70), we nd l() = 1 for elements

involving the rotation by angle  about y. these elements are || in number and
contribute to (69) the expression

a()

sinh( /2)

(73)

the remaining elements can be written g p where g is a rotation by  about the
z axis, and ,  are as dened above. using (15) and (34) we nd the transformation
matrix (1)l+mm
m exp(i2mp/k). this transformation is non-trivial and we have
to construct a sum similar to (51).

for technical variety we use the relations (5) so that the sum can be written,

since we may construct the heat kernel for an arbitrary reection group from the

these two equations are the culmination of this section.

the rst terms in these heat kernels are just exp(q ) times the q = 0 expres-

sions [1], and we have dened the monopole charge per reection domain

q =

equation (68) predicts that the linear dirichlet and neumann heat kernels should
add up to give the rotational linear heat kernel (56), and this is seen to be true (in
performing this sum we must use the relation q = 2q for the same value of q).

n are calculated using equation (58)

the linear zeta functions for ek q

 q
n (s, a) = 2(s, a + q|d1, d2) + qh(s, a + q)

(80)

(81)

it should be remembered that although we may add these two zeta functions to
produce the rotational zeta function, the physical theories are completely dierent
due to the changing sign of the magnetic eld. thus the procedure can only be
regarded as a formal trick.

9. general zeta function and its derivative

equations (58), (80) and (81) give zeta functions for the eigenvalues (l + a)2 if
s is replaced with 2s. in general we need the zeta functions for the more general
eigenvalues l = (l + a)2  2, with suitable constants a and . for example we
may add curvature coupling and mass terms to the hamiltonian hs2. in this case
the eigenvalue equation is,

(hs2 + r + m2)y (l)

qm = ly (l)
qm

and we nd a = 1/2, 2 = q2 + (1/4 2) m2 (r = 2 on the unit two-sphere). it is
assumed that 2 is positive. to analyse these general zeta functions we use similar
methods to those found in [21]. for brevity we shall just write (s) to represent a
general zeta function. for s > 1, we have the explicit mode sum

(s) =

xl=|q|

d(l)

[(l + a)2  2]s .

22

(82)

the function d(l) is the degeneracy of the eigenvalue l for some linear zeta function
if we assume that || < |q| + a we can
(i.e. rotational, dirichlet or neumann).
perform a binomial expansion on the summand which leads to a continuation of
(s) given by

(s) =

2r (s + r)
r!(s)

 q(2s + 2r, a).

(83)

xr=0

in the the above equation  q(s, a) is intended to be any one of the rotational, dirich-
let, or neumann zeta functions dened by equations (58), (80) and (81) respectively.
in order to tie in with [21] we generalise to the case where  q(s) represents
an arbitrary zeta function on a d-dimensional space with simple poles (only) at
s = 1, 2, . . . , d. this is the situation encountered in [21] where  q(s) would just be
a d-dimensional barnes function d(s, a|d) (of course the label q is defunct in the
general case). near the poles we dene,

 q(s + r, a) =

nr
s

+ rr + o(s),

s  0,

for r = 1, 2, . . . , d. for our three cases (with d = 2) the residues nr for r = 1, 2 can
be calculated from the specic forms of the zeta functions and (60).

the important fact is that the series (83) reduces to a nite sum when s is a

negative integer. thus we concentrate on these values of s and nd for n  z+,

(2)n(n) =

nxr=0

(2)r(cid:16) n

r(cid:17) q(2r, a) +

1

uxr=1

2r n!(r  1)!
(r + n)!

n2r.

(84)

the number u in the above is dened as [d/2] where d is the dimension of the space
under consideration. the derivative of the zeta function at s = n can also be
calculated from (83),

(2)n (n) =2

r(cid:17)(2)r q (2r, a)

where (z) = (z)/(z) is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function.

the problem now rests on the evaluation of the innite sum on the last line of
this expression. we show that this sum can be written in nite terms. it is expected
that the sum will be nite since we expect  (n) to be nite, and all other terms
on the right hand side are nite. a word of caution is that in singular situations,
there is the possibility that logarithmic terms, log , may appear in the asymptotic
expansion of the heat-kernel. if this were so, more care would have to be taken over
the evaluation of the determinants. however no such terms occur here.

using the integral representation (58) extended to the arbitrary zeta function

 q(s, a), we may write the last line in (85) as,

2n!

xn=u+1

2r

r!

(r + n)!(2r)!z 

0

 2r1e /2a ek q( )d ,

(86)

where ek q( ) is the linear heat kernel associated with  q(s, a). since (86) is assumed

nite we may take the sum inside the integral. thus our problem can be reduced
to evaluating the sequence of sums,

tn( ) = n!

r! 2r

(2r)!(r + n)!

.

xr=1

using the simple result (2r)! = 22rr!(r +1/2) and changing the summation

variable to r = r + n gives the result

tn( ) = n!(

 )1/2nin1/2( ) 

where i(x) is the modied bessel function.

nxr=0(cid:16) n

r(cid:17)(2r)!( 2)r ,

in reference [22]. for  > 0,

setting  = n+1/2 in this expression we may expand the integrand factors (1t2)n
using the binomial theorem leaving simple exponential integrals. after a little work
we nd,

it in the new form,

(88)

we have introduced into the integral a regulator  s (the expression that we want is
given for the value s = 0). the continuation variable s has been introduced so that
we may evaluate the integrals of the individual terms in the sum denition (87) of
tn, and of the sum subtracted from it, before we perform the sums. we assume
that s is large enough so that all the individual integrals are well dened. in fact
this requires s > 2n. performing the integrations leaves,

(89)
as s  0 all of these terms diverge, although taking all terms together we must get
a nite result i.e. all poles must cancel as s  0. this cancellation of the poles
leads to the equation,

 q(s+2r, a)

r(cid:17)(2)r { q(r  2n, a  ) + (1)r q(r  2n, a + )}

the statement,

r(cid:17)(2)r { q(r  2n, a  ) + (1)r q(r  2n, a + )} .

this expression contains equally terms with arguments a +  and a  . we shall
say that (n) is symmetric. it is a generalisation to general n of the symmetric
expression for n = 0 found in [21]. the methods used in this reference do not
produce a suitable pole cancellation to give a symmetric result for (n).

the quantities r in the above equation are dened as the sums,

r =

.

equation (92) is not symmetric in the sense that, unlike (91), it does not depend
only on the quantities a  . if we assume that the sum over the residues is a true
feature of  (n), as it is for  (0) in [21], then we are still left with a sum over
 q(2r, a). we will now re-write this sum in a more natural, i.e. symmetric, form.
to this end we introduce the intermediate zeta function, (s), on the space
m = r2n  s2/, which is given by
(s) =

(93)

(s  n)
(4)n(s)

(s  n) .

26

combining this with (83) gives an expansion for (s),

(s) =

q



(s, a) =

(4)n( 1
2 s)

 q(s  2n, a)

(94)

(95)

the dimension of m is d = 2n + d (remember, for our monopole case d = 2). we
see from (95) that 
(s) has poles at s = 2, 4, . . . , 2n and s = 2n + 1, 2n + 2, . . . , d.
the residues are given by the formulae,

r = 1, 2, . . . , d .

(97)

q

the purpose of making these new denitions is the functional similarity between
(83) and (94). this implies that results like (91) and (92) should exist for (s) in
(s). the important point is that we know that  (0) can be written as a
terms of 
symmetric part and a sum over the residues of  q(s, a), either from [21], or setting
n = 0 in (92). thus we might expect 
(0) to consist of a symmetric part and a
sum over the residues of 

(s, a). dierentiating (93) and setting s = 0 gives,

q







(0) =

(1)n
(4)nn!(cid:0) (n) + ((n + 1)  (1))(n)(cid:1) .

(98)

q

now (n) is symmetric in terms of  q(s, a ) and extends easily to a symmetric
(s, a) using (95). thus by our reasoning we expect  (n) to contain a
form for 
sum over the residues n r. this is exactly what we nd, and the nal result, in this
section, is the symmetrical expression, [23],

 (n) =

r(cid:17)(2)r { q (r  2n, a  ) + (1)r q (r  2n, a + )}
nxr=0(cid:16) n

the conclusion of these manipulations is that, despite the apparent awkward-
ness of the binomial expansion, (83), to obtain the required function, the quan-
tities that we want are given in nite terms, (91), (92), (99), and involve only
relatively standard functions such as generalised bernoulli polynomials introduced
via the barnes function.

10. vacuum energy calculations

simply as an example of the use of the preceding expressions, we evaluate some

vacuum (casimir) energies on s2/.

let  q(s, a) represent one of the rotational, dirichlet or neumann linear zeta
functions as in the previous section. then  q(s, a) can be extended to the odd-
dimensional space-time r  s2/ (or r  s2/) by dening a new zeta function
(s) given by (with a = 1/2),

(s) =

(s  1/2)
(4)1/2(s)

 q(2s, 1/2).

(100)

this zeta function corresponds to the rather articial case of a conformally coupled
eld in three dimensions with mass q2.  the vacuum energy associated with this
physical situation is dened by the simple formula [24],

e = 

1
2

r

d

ds(cid:18) 

r(cid:19)2s

(s)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)s=0

.

(101)

in this equation  is an arbitrary mass scale and r = 1/r is the mass scale associ-
ated with the sphere radius r (which has the value r = 1). equation (101) is in fact
just half the logarithmic determinant. inserting equation (100) into (101) gives the
simpler expression

e =

1
2

 q(1, 1/2),

(102)

for a scalar eld conformally coupled in n dimensions we have 4 = (n  2)/(n  1). in fact
we only require that 2 = 0 or equivalently m2 = q2 + (1/4  2).

28

which is nite and independent of  (we have set r = 1 again).

the vacuum energy on the space r  r2n  s2/() can also be found and
2 ). the calculation for general n is entirely

gives e proportional to  q(1  2n, 1
equivalent to the n = 0 case, which we now calculate.

using the denitions (80), (80) and equation (61), we nd from (102) the

dirichlet and neumann vacuum energies,

the constant (q independent) terms are exactly the same as those calculated in
[1] for q = 0, as required. adding together the dirichlet and neumann vacuum
energies gives the rotational vacuum energy

those for the corresponding rotational subgroups are obtained by adding the d and

we now go on to calculate the vacuum energy on the even-dimensional space

r2n  s2/(). using equations (93), (98) and (101) we nd the expression,

here (s) is the general zeta function dened via equations (82) and (83).

29

an innite contribution has been (arbitrarily) dropped to arrive at (103), the
logarithmic term being a relic of this divergence. since (0) is not zero for any
of the three monopole theories, we conclude from (103) that the vacuum energy
is explicitly dependent on the arbitrary scale . however for simplicity we shall
assume  = r = 1 for the rest of this section. our concern in this paper is not
with realistic quantum eld theory considerations.

equations (91), (92) imply that the calculation for increasing n merely requires
the evaluation of more and more zeta functions and their derivatives. thus we shall
concentrate on the simplest case n = 0 corresponding to s2/() itself. this will
also allow us to compare with the results for q = 0 studied in [21].

we consider the case of a massless eld with minimal coupling, that is m2 = 0

and  = 0. thus we have a = 1/2 and 2 =p4q2 + 1 (we shall still write  when

convenient). from the denitions (80), (81), and equations (91), (61), we nd for
dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions

{ d

n }(0) =

(d0(d0  1) + 1  6d0q + 18q2).

these expressions reduce to those found earlier for q = 0 [21]. for the rotational
case we simply add the dirichlet and neumann results to give

(0) =

1
6

+

1
6||

(d0(d0  1) + 1 + 18q2).

to calculate the vacuum energy we have still to calculate  (0). considering
equation (92) with n = 0 requires the evaluation of the residue n2. for both
dirichlet and neumann zeta functions we nd from (60) and (62) the value n2 =
2/||. using the derivative of the hurwitz zeta function in [20] then gives the zeta
function derivatives

inequality |x| + |y| px2 + y2 (x, y  r) implies that 1/2 + q  . the equality

30

is only met for q = 0, and in this case we have to remove the singularity in the rst
term  
2(0, 1/2 + q |d1, d2) of the dirichlet zeta function as in 21 (we shall do this
later). for q > 0 all terms in (105) and (104) are well dened.

there is no known analytic form for the derivatives of the barnes zeta functions
appearing in (105), (104) and so we have to calculate them numerically. to do this
we obviously need a continuation of the barnes zeta function which is open to easy
numerical computation. in [21] several ecient continuations are presented which
are valid for positive integer values of d1 and d2. however as we shall show in the
next section, it is useful to have an expression which is valid for all d1, d2  r+. we
shall now derive such an expression.

our starting point is the plana sum formula which we display here [25],

f (n) =

to be valid f (t) must be an analytic function in the region of the complex t plane
a  re (t)  b, and the integrals must exist. applying (106) twice to the sum
denition (59) of the barnes zeta function gives immediately, for s > 2,

(107)
it is simple to verify that we are meeting the conditions required for the validity
of the sum formula. in order to get rid of the single integrals in (107) we use the
plana sum denition of the hurwitz zeta function which is, from (106)

h(s, a) =

the integral part of this expression is equivalent to the integrals appearing in (107).

31

to simplify the double integral in (107) we rst perform a change of variables

(109)

from t, u to d1u  d2t. following this, we use the easily proved formula,

which is valid for re (x)  0. after a little work we nd the more convenient form
for the double integral,
2

(x + iy)s + (x  iy)s = 2 cos(cid:0)s tan1 y/x(cid:1),
cos(cid:0)s tan1(w/a)(cid:1)

all the non-trivial d1, d2 dependence has been absorbed into the function g(w)
which is independent of s and has the explicit form

(e1(w+y)  1)(e2y  1)(cid:27)

where we have dened i = 2/di, i = 1, 2. this function is symmetric under the
interchange of d1, d2 as one would expect. the factor (e2w  1) has been included
into the denition to ensure that g(w) is nite as w  0.

all the integrals in the denition of g(w) are divergent at their lower limits,
and the rst integral is also divergent at its upper limit. however one can check
that the combination is well dened. in fact by expanding the integrands at their
limits of integration we nd that for small  > 0,

(110)

g(w) =(e2w  1)(cid:26)z w



dy

(e1y  1)(e2(wy)  1)

z 



(e1y  1)(e2(w+y)  1) z 

dy



(e1(w+y)  1)(e2y  1)(cid:27) + o() .

dy

thus g(w) is easy to calculate numerically, with the error being of order . we may
also make  the lower limit of the integration over w in (109). since the integrand
with respect to w is nite at the lower limit, the error incurred will still be o().

the full expression for our continuation of the barnes zeta function, after deal-

ing with both the single and double integrals in (107), is

although this formula was derived for s > 2, it is actually a continuation to all
values of (complex) s except at the points s = 1, 2 where there are simple poles. it
is easy to check that these poles are correct in that their residues match those given
in (60). from (111) we can calculate the derivative of the barnes zeta function at

here we have used (108) again to convert derivatives of the hurwitz zeta function
h(s, a) at s = 1 into integrals suitable for numerical evaluation.

the expression (112) can be used directly in equation (105) and (104). figures
1 to 4 show plots of e =  (0)/2 for small values of q. the lines on the graphs for
t , o, and y are for labelling only. the graphs for ck and dk are plotted for all k,
although at the moment we are only concerned with the integral values k = 1, 2, . . .
marked with crosses. on each graph the value q of the charge per rotational domain
is always twice the reection value q so as to give the same value of q.

35

fig.3 vacuum energies for ck and dk with q = 1.

36

fig.4 vacuum energies for groups t , o and y as functions of q.

37

the graphs with q = q = 0 are exactly the same as those calculated in [21].
to plot the graphs in this case we have had to remove the divergence in the rst
barnes zeta function derivative in (105). this is due to a zero mode appearing
in the spectrum of the operator hs 2. the divergence is logarithmic and can be
removed by dening the so called -modular form 2 dened by [19,21],

lim
a0

 
2(0, a|d1, d2) =  ln a  ln 2.

the leading term  ln a on the right hand side is the divergent zero mode contri-
bution which must be removed. the form 2 has been calculated in terms of the
multiple gamma function by barnes [19,26]. the -modular form can be more easily
calculated by using the simply proved relation

2(s, a|d1, d2) = as + ds
) + 2(s, a + d1 + d2|d1, d2).
dierentiating this with respect to s at s = 0, and taking the limit a  0 leaves
the expression

2 h(s, 1 +

) + ds

 ln 2 =

2

ln(d1d2)  ln(2) +  

2(0, d0 + 1|d1, d2).

for q > 0, the zero mode that we have just removed for q = 0 is still almost
zero. this is the reason why the vacuum energy for the dirichlet zeta function
increases more rapidly with q than in the neumann case.

11. theory for a spherical slice

by a spherical slice of width  we mean the space s = {(, )|  [0, ] ,  
[0, ]} with the points (, 0) and (, ) identied (here (, ) are the spherical polar
coordinates on the sphere which shall be used throughout this section). one might
also term this space a periodic lune.

the starting point for the monopole theory on s is the solution to the explicit
dierential equation (4) with arbitrary q. as mentioned in the discussion surround-
ing the dierential equation the solutions are characterised by integers u, v, and
are given by equations (3), (5). we shall now show that it is possible to dene
consistent monopole theories on s corresponding to the rotational, dirichlet and
neumann cases already given. the rotational case is considered rst.

dene k by k = 2/ and letb denote a rotation by angle  about the z axis.

due to the identication of points in s at  = 0, , we will proceed convention-
ally and take the wave function to be single valued i.e. to have period . also,

38

for rapidity, the monopole charge quantisation will be obtained by requiring the
connecting function exp(i2q) to have period . this yields

q =

k
2

n , n  z .

(113)

corresponding to these values of q we nd a(b) = (1)n. if k is an integer then
s is a fundamental domain for the group ck (generated by b), and the relation

|ck| = k gives an equivalence between the quantisation conditions (39) and (113).
thus we see that the quantisation condition for arbitrary k is a generalisation of the
previous theory for ck (with integer k). from single valuedness, (, ) = (, 0),
for the monopole harmonics (5), we see from the explicit  dependence that,

m = jk  q ,

j  z .

(114)

in this more general setting it would appear that we can always choose n to be odd,
whereas before this was only possible for k odd also. from (5)) we nd the possible
values of l,

l = u +

(|j| + |n  j|) ,

u  z+ , j  z .

k
2

the eigenvalues  appearing in the mode equation (4) are still given by l(l + 1) q2.
as in section 7 we shall calculate the linear heat kernel for the eigenvalues (l + 1/2).
using the values of q, l, and m above gives the sum form for the linear heat

kernel analogous to (51), with (5),

k( ) = e /2

ek q

xu=0

xj=

e (u+k(|j|+|j+n|)/2 .

(115)

evaluating this sum gives exactly the result found before, equation (56), except
that now k is not an integer, and q need not be an integer multiple of k. a corollary
of this result is that (56) is also valid for the case when  = ck with k and 2q
odd integers. the zeta function dened by equation (58) is also correct for d1 = 1,
d2 = k and hence we conclude that the vacuum energies calculated in the previous
section are valid for arbitrary k.

for the dirichlet and neumann theories dened in section 8 we consider the slice
s/2 and two reection planes p0 and p1 which leave  = 0 and  = /2 invariant
respectively. following the same arguments as in section 8 gives the values of the
monopole charge

q = kn ,

39

(116)

which is equivalent to equation (65). taking  in (64) to be a reection in p0 and
using (17) gives the modes w (l)

qm as the combinations,

w (l)

qm(, ) = y (l)

qm(, ) + a()y (l)

qm are those dened in (3) with the string along the negative z axis, and

here y (l)
a() = 1 as before (the reection in p0 is expressed simply as   ).

the  dependent part of the modes w (l)

qm is given by

w (l)

qm  eiq (cid:26) cos(m) ,

sin(m) ,

a() = +1
a() = 1

.

qm(, 0) into a()w (l)

reection in p0 is equivalent to    and we see explicitly that this transforms
w (l)
qm(, 0) as required. reection in p1 is equivalent to  
   and results in the condition on m,
m = kj ,

(117)

j  z+ .

for the dirichlet case a() = 1 the m = 0 mode is in fact zero and has to be
removed. comparing (117) with (114) (with n = 2n even) we see that the only
dierence between the rotation and reection cases is that in the reection case the
values of m are restricted to positive integers.

the linear heat kernel for the neumann case a() = +1 is given by

n ( ) = e /2

ek q

xu=0

xj=0

e (u+k(|j+n|+|jn|)/2 .

(118)

explicit evaluation of the sum gives exactly the heat kernel as before, equation
(55). the dirichlet case involves subtracting the j = 0 term from (71) and yields
the previous expression (75). thus the zeta functions are given exactly as before
and we conclude that the vacuum energy calculated for ck is in fact valid for all k.
to extend the results of dk to arbitrary k we consider the slice of the upper
hemisphere s
 = {(, )|  [0, /2] ,   [0, ]} with again k = 2/. this is a
fundamental domain for dk when k is an integer. the theory then follows as for
the ck extension above, but we must include in this case a rotation about the x
axis by angle . this rotation can be thought of as a reection in the plane p0
followed by a reection in the x  y plane, which we call p2. the theory for s
above is adapted to the reection p0 and thus we see that p2 is the essential extra
detail here.

40

the reection p2 is equivalent to the transformation      which does not
aect the  dependence of the modes y (l)
qm(, ). since the extension to arbitrary
k is entirely linked with the  dependence, we conclude that all the heat kernels,
zeta functions and vacuum energies for dk can be extended to arbitrary k. the
values of the monopole charge in the reection case are calculated using the theory
of section 8 as

q = 2kn , n  z,
which is the generalisation of (65) with || = 4k.

12. summary and discussion

we have thoroughly adapted diracs monopole theory to the orbifold, s2/,
for the cases that  contains only rotations and when  is generated by reections.
in the former case we imposed rotational (periodic) boundary conditions on the
monopole solutions. in the latter we had a choice of boundary conditions dened so
as to reproduce dirichlet and neumann conditions for no monopole charge, q = 0.
we found that it was the monopole charge q = q/|| through s2/ that was dirac
quantised with 2q  z.

after all the formalities of the theory had been tidied we explicitly calculated
the vacuum energies on the orbifolds s2/ and r  s2/. formal expressions are
given for the generalisation to the spaces r2n  s2/ and r  r2n  s2/. finally
we provided an extension of the monopole theory to arbitrary slices of the sphere
and hemisphere. in this case the ux through the spherical region is still quantised,
although now the overall monopole charge q is not, in general, an integer or half
odd-integer.

we feel that the scalar theory has been developed essentially to its analytical
limit on the factored sphere. the next step would be the extension to r3/ for  a
reection or rotation group. this requires modes of the full hamiltonian which are
given by

y (l)

qm(, )j(kr)pk/r,

 =p(l + 1/2)2  q2

with eigenvalues k2. since the radial dependence does not involve m, the underlying
facts of the theory (modes on factored space, charge quantisation etc. ) are the
same as in the spherical case. however the heat-kernel calculation, and hence the

function, is completely dierent. due to the complicated index,p(l + 1/2)2  q2,

closed forms do not seem possible and asymptotic methods are needed. one could

41

always arbitrarily add a term q2/r to the (total) hamiltonian and then a closed form
would exist. this fact suggests that there is some signicance to this modication.
the spinor theory on the factored sphere s2/ has been considered by chang
[27]. he found a consistent theory only for  = ck with k odd. for q 6= 0 we claim
that the same restriction still holds. this follows from the lack of half odd-integral
solutions to the scalar monopole problem for  6= ck.

a possible extension of the scalar calculation would be to consider if (high
temperature) bose-einstein condensation occurs. the general theory has been laid
down by toms [28] see also kirsten and toms [29]. basically, all that is required
is to ensure that the function for the theory, and its derivative, are nite at zero
as the chemical potential approaches a critical value. on the two-sphere we can
use the calculations of (n) and  (n given in section 9 to study the theory on
r2n  s2. in fact we could also discuss r2n  sd.
