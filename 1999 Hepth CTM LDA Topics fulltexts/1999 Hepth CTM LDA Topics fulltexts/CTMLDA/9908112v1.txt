abstract

we newly apply the improved batalin-fradkin-tyutin(bft)

hamiltonian method to the o(3) nonlinear sigma model, and di-

rectly obtain the compact form of nontrivial rst class hamilto-

nian by introducing the bft physical elds. furthermore, fol-

lowing the bfv formalism, we derive the brst invariant gauge

xed lagrangian through the standard path-integral procedure.

finally, by introducing collective coordinates, we also study a

semi-classical quantization of soliton background to conclude that

the spectrum of zero modes are unchanged through the bft pro-

cedure.

1 introduction

the o(3) nonlinear sigma model has interesting physical content in its phe-
nomenological aspects. for instance, in the euclidean space it describes
classical (anti)ferromagnetic spin systems at their critical points[1], while
in the minkowski one it delineates the long wavelength limit of quantum
antiferromagnets[2]. also the model exhibits solitons, hopf instantons and
novel spin and statistics in 2+1 space-time dimensions with inclusion of the
chern-simons term[3, 4].

on the other hand, it has been well known that in order to quantize
physical systems with constraints, dirac method[5] has been conventionally
used. the poisson brackets in the second-class constraint system can be
converted into the dirac brackets for the self-consistency. however, dirac
brackets are generically eld-dependent, nonlocal, and have ordering prob-
lems between eld operators. these are unfavorable in nding canonically
conjugate pairs. however, if the rst class constraint system is realized,
the usual poisson bracket corresponding to the quantum commutator can
be used without introducing the dirac brackets. quantizations in this di-
rection have been well appreciated in a gauge invariant fashion by using the
becci-rouet-stora-tyutin(brst) symmetry [6].

to overcome the above problems, batalin, fradkin, and tyutin (bft)
developed a method [7] which converts the second class constraints into rst
class ones by introducing auxiliary elds. recently, this bft formalism has
been applied to several interesting models [8, 9].
in particular, the rela-
tion between the dirac scheme and bft one, which had been obscure and
unsettled, was explicitly claried in the framework of the su(2) skyrmion
model[10]. also the bft hamiltonian method was applied[11] to the su(2)
skyrmion model to directly obtain the compact form of the rst class hamil-
tonian, via the construction of the bft physical elds. on the other hand,
this bft approach was applied to o(3) nonlinear sigma model by several au-
thors, but they could not obtain the desired compact form of the rst class
hamiltonian[15] and therefore could not carry out further discussions.

the motivation of this paper is to systematically apply the improved
bft[9] scheme, and the batalin, fradkin and vilkovisky (bfv)[12, 13, 14]
and brst methods to the o(3) nonlinear sigma model[4] as a nontrivial ex-
ample of topological system. in section 2, we convert second class constraints
into rst class ones according to the bft method. in section 3, we construct

1

the rst class bft physical elds and directly derive the compact form of the
rst class hamiltonian in terms of these elds without studying innitely iter-
ated standard procedure, which has been carried out for the su(2) skyrmion
case[16]. then, we investigate some properties of poisson brackets of these
bft physical elds, which yield the dirac brackets in the limit of vanishing
auxiliary elds in section 4. we construct the brst invariant gauge xed
lagrangian in the bfv scheme through the standard path-integral proce-
dure in section 5. we nally study a semi-classical quantization of soliton by
introducing collective coordinates in section 6.

2 first class constraints

in this section, we perform the standard bft procedure for the o(3) non-
linear sigma model which is a second class constraint system. in the o(3)
nonlinear sigma model, the starting lagrangian is of the form

l0 = z d2x" 1

2f

(na)(na)#

(2.1)

where na (a=1,2,3) is a multiplet of three real scalar eld with a constraint

1 = nana  1  0.

(2.2)

here, one notes that the unit 3-vector na parametrizes an internal space s2.
one can now obtain the canonical hamiltonian by performing the legendre
transformation,

hc = z d2x" f

2

aa +

1
2f

(ina)(ina)#

(2.3)

where a is the canonical momenta conjugate to the real scalar elds na given
by

a =

na.

(2.4)

1
f

the time evolution of the constraint 1 yields one additional secondary con-
straint as follows,

2 = naa  0

(2.5)

2

and they form the second class constraints algebra

kk(x, y) = {k(x), k(y)} = 2kk

nana(x  y)

(2.6)

with 12 = 21 = 1.

following the bft formalism [7, 8, 9] which systematically converts the
second class constraints into rst class ones, we introduce two auxiliary elds
i according to the number of second class constraints i with the poisson
brackets

{i(x), j(y)} = ij(x, y)

where we are free to make a choice

ij(x, y) = ij(x  y).

(2.7)

(2.8)

the rst class constraints i are then constructed as a power series of the
auxiliary elds:



i =

xn=0

(n)

i

,

(0)

i = i

(2.9)

i

where (n)
are polynomials in the auxiliary elds j of degree n, to be deter-
mined by the requirement that the rst class constraints i satisfy the closed
algebra as follows

{ i(x), j(y)} = 0.

since (1)

i

are linear in the auxiliary elds, one can make the ansatz

i (x) = z d2yxij(x, y)j(y).
(1)

substituting eq. (2.11) into eq. (2.10) leads to the following relation

ij(x, y) +z d2zd2zxik(x, z)kl(z, z)xjl(z, y) = 0.

which, for the choice of eq. (2.8), has a solution

xij(x, y) =   2

0 nana ! (x  y).

0

3

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

substituting eq. (2.13) into eqs. (2.9) and (2.11) and iterating this proce-
dure, one obtains the rst class constraints as follows

1 = 1 + 21,
2 = 2  nana2

(2.14)

which yield the strongly involutive rst class constraint algebra (2.10). there-
fore, we formally converted the second class constraint system into the rst
class one. in the next section, we shall obtain the rst class physical elds
and hamiltonian.

3 first class physical elds and hamiltonian

now, following the improved bft formalism[9], we newly construct the rst
class bft physical elds f = (na, a) corresponding to the original elds
dened by f = (na, a) in the extended phase space, which are obtained as
a power series in the auxiliary elds i by demanding that they are strongly
involutive: { i, f} = 0. in general, the rst class elds satisfying the bound-
ary conditions f [f ; 0] = f can be found as

f[f ; ] = f +



xn=1

f (n),

f (n)  ()n

(3.1)

where the (n + 1)-th order of iteration terms are given by the formula

f (n+1) = 

1

n + 1 z d2xd2yd2zi(x)ij(x, y)x jk(y, z)g(n)

k (z)

(3.2)

with

g(n)

{(nm)

, f (m)}(f ) +

n2

xm=0

{(nm)

, f (m+2)}() +{(n+1)

(3.3)

after some lengthy algebra, we obtain the rst class physical elds as



na = na 1 
a = (cid:16)a  na2(cid:17) 1 +

xn=1

n!



xn=1

(1)n(2n  3)!!

(1)n

(nana)n! ,

(1)n(2n  1)!!

n!

(1)n

(nana)n!

(3.4)

with (1)!! = 1. here one notes that the product of two polynomials in na
and a yields unity, i.e.,

 1 



xn=1

(1)n(2n  3)!!

n!

(1)n

(nana)n! 1 +

(1)n(2n  1)!!

n!

(1)n

(nana)n! = 1,



xn=1

(3.5)
which is crucial in derivation of the forthcoming equations such as eqs. (4.1)
and (4.5).

using the novel property[9] that any functional k( f ) of the rst class

elds f is also rst class, i.e.,

k(f ; ) = k( f)

(3.6)

we construct the rst class hamiltonian in terms of the above bft physical
variables as follows

h = z d2x" f

2

aa +

2f

(ina)(ina)# .

(3.7)

we then directly rewrite this hamiltonian in terms of original elds and
auxiliary ones1

h = z d2x " f

(3.8)

which is strongly involutive with the rst class constraints

{ i, h} = 0.

1in deriving the rst class hamiltonian h of eq. (3.8), we have used the conformal
map condition, naina = 0, which states that the radial vector is perpendicular to the
tangent on the s2 sphere in the extended phase space of the o(3) nonlinear sigma model.
the geometrical structure is then conserved in the map from the original phase space to
the extended one. in other words, the s2 sphere given by nana = 1 in the original phase
space is casted into the other sphere nana = 1  21 in the extended phase space without
any distortion. with this conformal map condition, we have conrmed that the rst class
hamiltonian h of eq. (3.8) is consistently derived from both the novel property (3.6) and
the innitely iterated standard procedure, as expected.

5

it seems to be appropriate to comment on the hamiltonian (3.8). the
form of the rst term in this hamiltonian is exactly the same as that of the
su(2) skyrmion[10, 11].

on the other hand, with the rst class hamiltonian (3.8), one cannot nat-
urally generate the rst class gauss law constraint from the time evolution
of the constraint 1. now, by introducing an additional term proportional
to the rst class constraints 2 into h, we obtain an equivalent rst class
hamiltonian

which naturally generates the gauss law constraint

h  = h +z d2xf 2 2

{ 1, h } = 2f 2,
{ 2, h } = 0.

(3.9)

(3.10)

here one notes that h and h  act on physical states in the same way since
such states are annihilated by the rst class constraints. similarly, the equa-
tions of motion for observables will also be unaected by this dierence.
furthermore, if we take the limit i  0, then our rst class system exactly
returns to the original second class one.

4 structures of dirac and poisson brackets

next let us consider the poisson brackets of elds in the extended phase
space f and identify the dirac brackets by taking the vanishing limit of
auxiliary elds. after some manipulation from eq. (3.4), one could obtain
the commutators

{na(x), nb(y)} = 0,

{na(x), b(y)} = (ab 

nanb
ncnc )(x  y),

{a(x), b(y)} =

1
ncnc (nba  nab)(x  y).

(4.1)

in the limit i  0, the above poisson brackets in the extended phase space
exactly reproduce the corresponding dirac brackets [4]

{na, nb}|=0 = {na, nb}d,

6

{na, b}|=0 = {na, b}d,
{a, b}|=0 = {a, b}d

(4.2)

where

{a(x), b(y)}d = {a(x), b(y)} z d2zd2z{a(x), k(z)}kk

{k(z), b(y)}
(4.3)
with kk being the inverse of kk in eq. (2.6). also it is amusing to see
in eq. (4.1) that these poisson brackets of f s have exactly the same form
of the dirac brackets of the eld f obtained by the replacement of f with
f. in other words, the functional k in eq. (3.6) corresponds to the dirac
brackets {a, b}|d and hence k corresponding to { a, b} becomes

{ a, b} = {a, b}d|a a,b b.

(4.4)

this kind of situation happens again when one considers the rst class con-
straints (2.14). more precisely these rst class constraints in the extended
phase space can be rewritten as

1 = nana  1,
2 = naa,

(4.5)

which are form-invariant with respect to the second class constraints (2.5).

5 bfv-brst gauge xing

in this section, in order to obtain the eective lagrangian, we introduce two
canonical sets of ghosts and anti-ghosts together with auxiliary elds in the
framework of the bfv formalism [12, 13, 14], which is applicable to theories
with the rst class constraints:

(ci, pi),

(p i, ci),

(n i, bi),

(i = 1, 2)

which satisfy the super-poisson algebra

{ci(x), pj(y)} = {p i(x), cj(y)} = {n i(x), bj(y)} = i

j(x  y),

7

where the super-poisson bracket is dened as

{a, b} =

a
q

|r

b
p

|l  (1)ab b
q

|r

a
p

|l

where a denotes the number of fermions called ghost number in a and the
subscript r and l imply right and left derivatives, respectively.

in the o(3) nonlinear sigma model, the nilpotent brst charge q, the
fermionic gauge xing function  and the brst invariant minimal hamil-
tonian hm are given by

q = z d2x (ci i + p ibi),
 = z d2x ( cii + pin i),
hm = h  z d2x 2f c1 p2,

(5.1)

which satisfy the following relations

{q, hm} = 0, q2 = {q, q} = 0, {{, q}, q} = 0.

(5.2)

the eective quantum lagrangian is then described as

lef f = z d2x (a na +   + b2 n 2 + pi ci + c2 p 2)  htot

(5.3)

with htot = hm  {q, }. here we identied the auxiliary elds i with a
canonical conjugate pair (, ), i.e.,

i = (, )

(5.4)

and r d2x (b1 n 1 + c1 p 1) = {q,r d2x c1 n 1} terms are suppressed by replac-

ing 1 with 1 + n 1.

now we choose the unitary gauge

1 = 1, 2 = 2

(5.5)

and perform the path integration over the elds b1, n 1, c1, p 1, p1 and c1,
by using the equations of motion, to yield the eective lagrangian of the

8

form

lef f = z d2x ha na +   + b n + p c + c p

(5.6)

with redenitions: n  n 2, b  b2, c  c2, c  c2, p  p2, p  p2.

using the variations with respect to a, , p and p, one obtain the

relations

na = f (a  na)ncnc + na(f   n  b),
 = f na(a  na)ncnc + nana(2f   2 cc + n) + f naa,
p =  c,

after identifying

we then obtained the eective lagrangian of the form

(5.12)

this lagrangian is invariant under the brst transformation

bna = nac,
b c = b,

b = nanac,
bc = bb = 0.

(5.13)

this completes the standard procedure of brst invariant gauge xing in
the bfv formalism.

it seems to be appropriate to comment that we could directly read o
the gauge-invariant rst class lagrangian corresponding to the rst class
hamiltonian (23) from eq. (39) as follows

l = l0 + lw z

(5.14)

6 semi-classical quantization

in this section, we perform a semi-classical quantization of the q = 1 sector
of the o(3) nonlinear sigma model [4] to consider physical aspects of the
theory. here the topological charge q is given by

where j  is the topological current

q = z d2xj0(x),

j =

1
8

abcna nbnc.

(6.1)

(6.2)

on the other hand, the o(3) nonlinear soliton theory is not invariant un-
der spatial rotations uj (1) or isospin rotation ui(1) separately. it is instead
invariant under a combined spatial and isospin rotation. since the theory
is invariant under ui(1)  uj (1), as a rst approximation to the quantum
ground state we could quantize zero modes responsible for classical degener-
acy by introducing collective coordinates as follows 2

n1 = cos((t) + ) sin f (r),
n2 = sin((t) + ) sin f (r),
n3 = cos f (r),

(6.3)

2given the soliton conguration (6.3), one could easily calculate the spatial derivatives
to yield naina = 0. as a result one could conclude that the conformal map condition is
fullled in the above soliton conguration, as expected. on the other hand we also have
the relation na0na = 0.

10

where (r, ) are the polar coordinates and (t) is the collective coordinates.
here, in order to ensure q = 1, the prole function f (r) satises the bound-
ary conditions: limr f (r) =  and f (0) = 0.

using the above soliton conguration, we obtain the unconstrained la-

grangian of the form

l = e +

1

i 2

where the soliton energy and the moment of inertia are given by

e =

drr sin2 f.

(6.4)

(6.5)

introducing the canonical momentum conjugate to the collective coordinate


we then have the canonical hamiltonian

p = i 

h = e +

1
2i

p2
.

(6.6)

(6.7)

at this stage, one can associate the hamiltonian (6.7) with the previous
one (2.3), which was given by the canonical momenta a. given the soliton
conguration (6.3) one can obtain the relation between a and p as follows

to yield the integral

aa =

sin2 f
i 2f 2

p2


z d2x

f
2

aa =

1
2i

p2
.

(6.8)

(6.9)

since the spatial derivative term in (2.3) yields nothing but the soliton energy
e, one can easily see, together with the relation (6.9), that the canonical
hamiltonian (2.3) is equivalent to the other one (6.7), as expected.
now, let us dene the angular momentum operator j as follows

j = z d2xijxit oj

11

(6.10)

where the symmetric energy-momentum tensor is given by

t  =

=

l

 na  gl

(na)
1
f

na na 

1
2f

gnana.

(6.11)

then, substituting the conguration (6.3) into eq. (6.11), we obtain the

angular momentum operator of the form

j = i  = p.

(6.12)

with p = i 
of the u(1) isospin operator i as follows

 , the angular momentum operator can be rewritten in terms

to yield the hamiltonian of the form

j = i




= i

h = e +

1
2i

j 2.

(6.13)

(6.14)

here one notes that the above hamiltonian can be interpreted as that of a
rigid rotator.

next let us consider the zero modes in the extended phase space by in-

troducing the soliton conguration

n1 = (1  2)1/2 cos((t) + ) sin f (r),
n2 = (1  2)1/2 sin((t) + ) sin f (r),
n3 = (1  2)1/2 cos f (r),

(6.15)

which satisfy the rst class constraint nana = 1  2 of eq. (2.14).3 in this
conguration from eqs. (2.1) and (5.11) we then obtain

l0 = (1  2)e +

(6.16)

3due to the identity (cid:16)1 p

12 , one can easily see that
the rst class physical elds na of eq. (3.4) satisfy the corresponding rst class constraint
nana = 1 of eq. (4.5).

to yield the rst class lagrangian l in (5.14), which is remarkably the
lagrangian (6.4) given in the original phase space due to the exact can-
cellation of -terms. consequently the quantization of zero modes in the
extended phase space reproduces the same energy spectrum (6.14). this
phenomenon originates from the fact that the collective coordinates  in the
lagrangian (6.4) are not aected by the constraints (2.2) and (2.14) for the
real scalar elds na. here one notes that in the su(2) skyrmion model the
collective coordinates themselves are constrained to yield the modied energy
spectrum[10, 16] in contrast to the case of the o(3) nonlinear sigma model.

7 conclusion

in summary, we have constructed the rst class bft physical elds, in terms
of which the rst class hamiltonian is formulated to be consistent with the
hamiltonian with the original elds and auxiliary elds. the poisson brack-
ets of the bft physical elds are also built to reproduce the corresponding
dirac brackets in the limit of vanishing auxiliary elds. in the batalin, frad-
kin and vilkovisky (bfv) scheme[12, 13, 14], we have then obtained the
brst invariant gauge xed lagrangian including the (anti)ghost elds, and
its brst transformation rules. on the other hand, introducing the collective
coordinates in the soliton conguration, we have performed the semi-classical
quantization to yield the energy spectrum which can be interpreted as that
of the rigid rotator. also, we have newly recognized that the spectrum of
zero modes are reproduced through the bft hamiltonian procedure. the
chern-simons terms will be included through further investigation to gener-
alize the bft and bfv-brst schemes for the nonlinear sigma model to the
fractional spin systems.

constant concerns and encouragement. we would also like to thank y.-
