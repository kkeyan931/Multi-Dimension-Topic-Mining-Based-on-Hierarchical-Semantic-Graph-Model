the kaluza-klein spectrum of d = 5 simple supergravity compactied on s 3 is
studied. a classical background solution which preserves maximal supersymmetry is
fullled by the geometry of ads2  s 3. the physical spectrum of the uctuations is
classied according to su (1, 1|2) su (2) symmetry, which has a very similar structure
to that in the case of compactication on ads3  s 2.

1. introduction maldacenas conjecture [1] is one of the most attractive subjects among

recent progress in the non-perturbative string/m-theory. in this paper, we consider d = 5

simple supergravity (sugra) with 0-brane solution whose near-horizon geometry is the
direct product of two-dimensional anti-de-sitter space and three-sphere (ads2  s3), and
investigate its kaluza-klein spectrum. assuming that the ads2/cf t1 correspondence
holds [2]-[5], we show that the spectrum possesses su (1, 1|2) su (2) symmetry. it must be
remarked that gauntlett et.al.[6] has recently evinced the super-poincare group of ads2s3
sugra to be su (1, 1|2)  su (2). our results provide each kaluza-klein mode with the
precise assignment to the certain representation of su (1, 1|2)  su (2).

on the other hand, d = 5 simple sugra possesses a very similar structure to that

of d = 11 sugra [7]-[10].

in particular, the former theory allows solitonic string (1-

brane) and particle (0-brane) solutions that respectively correspond to m5- and m2-brane

solutions in the latter [11]. while the near-horizon geometry of the solitonic 1-brane in
d = 5 simple sugra is ads3  s2, that of the solitonic 0-brane is ads2  s3.
in
the previous work [12], the kaluza-klein spectrum in this ads3  s2 compactication
is studied and its su (1, 1|2)r  su (1, 1)l symmetry, which can be regarded as the nite-
dimensional subalgebra of chiral n = (4, 0) superconformal algebra, is found. interestingly

enough, two dierent compactications are endowed with quite similar symmetries, chiral
su (1, 1|2)rsu (1, 1)l and single su (1, 1|2)su (2). it originates in the magnetic/electric
duality between ads3  s2 and ads2  s3 simple sugra theories.

2. field equations

in terms of the metric gm n , u (1) gauge eld am , and the spin-3/2

eld m , d = 5 simple sugra is dened by the lagrangian

where the notations used here follow those in [8] and the signature is (+    ). capital
roman letters run from 0 to 4. in the absence of the m eld, einstein-maxwells equation

is shown to be

the above equation of motion enjoys freund-rubin-like solutions [13] that preserve the

maximal number of the supersymmetries after three-dimensional compactication. one of

these such solutions over which we will be considering the kaluza-klein spectrum possesses

to diagonalize the mass matrices derived from the above equation, we adopt the spherical
harmonics on s3 with the rank-0, 1 and 2. to begin with, let us summarize the properties
of three-dimensional spherical harmonics. because the isometry group of s3 is so(4),
eigenfunctions of the three-dimensional laplacian  = mm, and the three-dimensional
spherical harmonics, simultaneously belong to a certain representation of so(4). on the
other hand, so(4) is decomposed into a direct product of two su (2)s, namely su (2) 
su (2). therefore, we are able to use spins of two su (2)s to classify the kaluza-klein
2
spectrum. let ~j 2 (~j
j(j + 1) (j(j + 1)) for j, j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2,. (j) ( (j)) is the representation of su (2)
(su (2)) with spin j (j). in general, j and j can take dierent half-integer values. the
dierence |j  j| is called the rank of the spherical harmonic. this rank corresponds to that
of the tensor structure not on ads2 but on s3. spherical harmonics with rank-0,1, and 2
are explicitly constructed as follows.

) denote the casimir operator of su (2) (su (2)) with eigenvalues

1. rank-0 harmonics

2
first, for scalar functions on s3, one can conrm the equality among ~j 2, ~j

, and 

  = 4 ~j 2 = 4~j

2

.

(11)

it is shown that a product y (k) = (k/2) (k/2) behaves as a scalar on s3 and is an
eigenfunction of . in fact, its eigenvalue for  is given by k(k + 2) = 4j(j + 1) =
4j(j + 1), where k = 2j = 2j = 0, 1, 2,.

2. rank-1 harmonics

2 ) ( k1

in a similar way to the case for rank-0 harmonics, one can prove that y (k,)
=
( k1
2 ) are vector functions on s3 and, simultaneously, eigenfunctions of the
laplacian with the eigenvalue  = k(k + 2)  1 for k = 1, 2, 3,. introducing the
3mnpvp;n, we should remark that
rotational derivative for vector elds (rot v)m = e

m

rot y (k,)

m

= (k + 1)y (k,)

m

.

(12)

3. rank-2 harmonics

2 ) ( k2

mn = ( k2
y (k,)
eigenvalue  = k(k + 2)  2 for k = 2, 3, 4,.

2 ) are rank-2 tensors on s3 and are eigenfunctions of  with the

by expanding the bosonic elds am and hm n in terms of the above spherical harmonics,

the eld equation (6)-(10) is separated into three sets with rank-0, 1 and 2. the so(4)-

charge of each bosonic mode is inherited from the used spherical harmonic with a certain

rank. the results are summarized in the following.

3

1. rank-0

the eigenvalues of the two-dimensional dalembertian 2 on ads2 for hmn
 a; and h

 are

;m;n, h

;;,

and

2 = 2 = k2  2k for k = 2, 3, 4,

2 = k2 + 6k + 8 for k = 0, 1, 2, .

(13)

(14)

the reason why the tower (13) begins from k = 2 is because at k = 0 the mass-matrix

is degenerated, and at k = 1 the eigenvalue corresponding to this tower is inconsistent
with the tensor structure of hmn which is the origin of hmn

;m;n. the so(4)-charges

corresponding to both of the above two branches prove identically

(j, j) = ( k

2 , k

2 ).

(15)

2. rank-1

let us consider the mass-matrices on  hm; and am. one can immediately see
that the mass matrices take dierent forms for y (k,+)
. the eigenvalues for
y (k,+)
m

or y (k,)

are

m

m

2 = k2 + 8k + 15

or k2  1

with the same so(4) charge

(j, j) = ( k+1
for k = 1, 2, 3,. the eigenvalues for y (k,)

m

are

2 , k1
2 )

2 = k2  4k + 3 for k = 2, 3, 4

2 = k2 + 4k + 3

for k = 1, 2, 3

and

with the so(4)-charges

(j, j) = ( k1

2 , k+1

2 ).

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

we should remark that the eigenvalue (18) for k = 1 is missing. at k = 1, this mode
is massless and degenerates into that of k2  1 (k = 1). however, the dynamical
degree of freedom for massless scalars in the present case is merely one, and the three-
dimensional chirality such that j  j < 0 is not consistent with the two-dimensional
parity of the scalar elds. therefore, we drop that mode.

4

3. rank-2

on the rank-2 eld hmn, the dalembertian has the eigenvalue

2 = k2 + 2k for k = 2, 3, 4 ,

for both

(j, j) = ( k2

2 , k2

2 ).

(21)

(22)

4. kaluza-klein spectrum: fermionic modes the fermionic uctuation around the
ads2  s3 background, m = 0, is labeled simply by m itself. its linearized equation of
motion is drawn from the lagrangian (1):

im n p p ;n 

3
4

i(m n p q + 2 g m [p g q]n )n f



p q = 0.

(23)

to analyze the kaluza-klein spectrum from (23), we utilize rank-1/2 spherical harmonic
m on s3 which is an eigenspinor of the equation

nnm + mnn =  m.

(24)

once such rank-1/2 spherical harmonic m and eigenvalue  are found, the eld equation
(23) is reduced to the following two-dimensional dirac equation for m,

5m

; +(cid:18) 

1

2(cid:19) m = 0.

(25)

therefore, the fermionic spectrum is obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem (24).

the rank-1/2 spherical harmonic m can be expanded by the product of rank-1 har-
monics and killing spinors on s3, i.e. the seperation of the total angular momentum into

the orbital and the internal ones. by proceeding this expansion with the help of the gauge
xing m m = 0, we see that the eigenvalue  can take one of the values

 = k  5
2 ,
 = k  1
2 ,
 = k  1
2 ,
 = k + 3
2 ,

(j, j) = ( k+2

(j, j) = ( k2

2 , k1
2 )
2 , k+1
2 )
2 , k1
2 )
2 , k+1
2 )

(j, j) = ( k

(j, j) = ( k

for k = 1, 2, 3 ,
for k = 2, 3, 4 ,
for k = 1, 2, 3 ,
for k = 1, 2, 3 .

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

several remarks are in order. first, for the two towers (26) and (27), the gamma-traceless
condition, mm = 0, which means |j  j| = 3/2, is satised while it is not satised for the

5

other two. secondly, the eigenstate for (27) at k = 1 is absent because one can show that
for that tower, m = 0 at k = 1 by using its explicit form.

the way to assign the so(4)-charge to each mode indicated in (26)-(29) may need
some explanation. to see this, one should utilize the above mentioned fact that m can be
expanded by the product of y (k,)
with so(4)-charge (k/2  1/2, k/2  1/2) and killing
spinors with (1/2, 0). let us note here that the killing spinors with (1/2, 0) possess the
negative chirality for r4 in which s3 is embedded.
harmonic m has one of the so(4) charges in the following decomposition.

in summary, the rank-1/2 spherical

m

( k+1

2 , k1

2 )  ( 1

2 , 0)  ( k1
= ( k+2

2 , k+1
2 , k1

2 )  ( 1
2 , 0)
2 )  ( k2
2 , k+1

2 )  ( k

2 , k1

2 )  ( k

2 , k+1

2 ),

(30)

where the representation as ( k+1

2 , k2

2 ) starts from k = 2 while the others from k = 1. the

irreducible decomposition (30) gives the charges in (26)-(29).

5. symmetry of the spectrum let us classify the acquired kaluza-klein spectrum

by a certain symmetry group. by considering the super-poincare group consisting of the

isometry and the supercharges, the symmetry of the modes is shown to be a superalgebra
su (1, 1|2)  su (2) [6]. we should remark that the bosonic part of su (1, 1|2)  su (2) is
su (1, 1)  su (2)  su (2) = so(1, 2)  so(4), which is nothing but the product of the
isometry group of ads2 and that of s3. moreover, let us note that su (1, 1|2) is a nite-
dimensional subalgebra of n = 4 super-virasoro algebra. the oscillator representations
[15], which is very helpful to visualize the representations, of su (1, 1|2) has already ap-
peared in the analysis of the kaluza-klein spectrum on ads3  s3 and also on ads3  s2
[16]-[20].

assuming that this sugra is coupled to a one-dimensional conformal eld theory at

the boundary of ads2, we can translate each kaluza-klein mode into a conformal weight

h by means of the formula in [14, 21]

1 + 1 + 2

2

.

h =

finally we can t these results into representations of su (1, 1|2)  su (2). in [12], we
dealt with a chiral su (1, 1|2)r  su (1, 1)l symmetry. upon replacing the su (1, 1)l by
su (2), we conrm that all kaluza-klein modes fall into four supermultiplets of su (1, 1|2)
su (2) in a similar manner to the case of ads3  s2. every spectrum obeying this single
in those four gures, one of
su (1, 1|2)  su (2) symmetry is summarized in figs. 1-4.
the two su (2)-charges, namely j is xed at a certain value. for example, the elds with
the same j = k/2 and j  j = 0,1/2, and 1 are gathered in fig.1.
one can notice a multiplet-shortening very similar to that for the chiral primary elds in

in each gure,

two-dimensional n = 4 superconformal theories. the shortest supermultiplet appears as a

doubleton in fig. 3 (k = 1). the massless multiplets exist in figs. 1, 2, 3 (k = 2).

6. discussions from the explicit calculation of the kaluza-klein spectrum of the ads2 
s3 simple sugra, we have seen that the two dierent compactications, ads3  s2 and
ads2  s3, are characterized by closely related superalgebras, su (1, 1|2)r  su (1, 1)l and
su (1, 1|2) su (2), respectively, each of which allows short representations. the similarity
between the spectra of ads3  s2 and ads2  s3 is not accidental but owing to the mag-
netic/electric duality for the solitonic 1-brane and the 0-brane in d = 5 simple sugra.

einstein-maxwells equation (2) allows two kinds of solitonic objects. one is the solitonic

1-brane solution as follows. the metric with a solitonic 1-brane is

ds2

5 = h 1

1 (dt2 + dy2) + h 2

1 (dr2 + r2d2

2), h1 = 1 +

q1
r

,

(33)

where (t, y) is the coordinate of the world-sheet, r is the distance from the soliton, and q1

is a constant. the non-zero eld strength of the gauge eld is

f ij = 

3ijkh 4

1 kh1,

(34)

where both indices i and j denote transverse directions, i.e. not t or y. from the form

of the eld strength, this soliton corresponds to a magnetic monopole. it is worthwhile to
mention that the near-horizon geometry is nothing but ads3  s2. the other one is the
solitonic 0-brane solution. the metric and the eld strength in this conguration are

ds2

5 = h 2
t 

f  = (

h0 = 1 +

3),

3

0 dt2 + h0(dr2 + r2d2
r 
r  
q0
r2 ,

q0
r3h0

t ) 

,

(35)

where t parameterizes the world-line, r is the distance from the 0-brane, and q0 is the

charge of the soltonic 0-brane. one can see that the gauge eld corresponds to that induced
by an electric charge and that the near-horizon geometry turns out to be ads2 s3. there-
fore, the similarity of the spectra can be regarded as a reminiscent of the ve-dimensional

magnetic/electric duality.

on the other hand, as is discussed in [3], the su (1, 1) isometry of ads2 can be enlarged

to a single innite-dimensional virasoro symmetry in the boundary similarly to that in

the case of ads3/cf t2 [22]. this single (super-)virasoro algebra has been explicitly con-

structed in the study of conformal mechanics that describes the behavior of a test particle

near the horizon of a four-dimensional extreme reissner-nordstrom black hole [2]. it would
be interesting to explore the relation between the conformal mechanics and ads2  s3 sim-
