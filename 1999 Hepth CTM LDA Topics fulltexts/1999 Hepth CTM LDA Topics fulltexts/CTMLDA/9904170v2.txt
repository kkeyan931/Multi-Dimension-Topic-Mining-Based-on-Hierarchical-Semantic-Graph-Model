abstract

,

a representation of the quadratic dirac equation and the maxwell
equations in terms of the three-dimensional universal complex cliord
algebra c 3
0 is given. the investigation considers a subset of the full al-
gebra, which is isomorphic to the baylis algebra. the approach is based
on the two casimir operators of the poincare group, the mass operator
and the spin operator, which is related to the pauli-lubanski vector. the
extension to spherical symmetries is discussed briey. the structural dif-
ference to the baylis algebra appears in the shape of the hyperbolic unit,
which plays an integral part in this formalism.

introduction

in the same way as complex numbers are associated with the euclidean ge-
ometry, the two other systems of bidimensional hypercomplex numbers can be
associated with geometries of physical relevance. the parabolic numbers can be
associated with the galileo group and the hyperbolic numbers with the lorentz
group of special relativity [1, 2].

the hamilton quaternions as well as the bidimensional systems are included
in the more general cliord algebras [3, 4, 5, 6]. they can represent the eu-
clidean geometry because their invariant quantity is an algebraic quadratic form
as well as the euclidean and pseudo-euclidean invariants.

the hyperbolic numbers oer the possibility to represent the four-component
dirac spinor as a two-component hyperbolic spinor. hucks has shown [7] that
the lorentz group is equivalent to the hyperbolic unitary group and that the
operations of c, p, and t on dirac spinors are closely related to the three types
of complex conjugation that exist when both hyperbolic and ordinary imaginary
units are present.

since the relativistic spin group is representable as an unitary group, the
special linear group, which is normally used to represent the relativistic spin,
has to be considered as an unitary group as well. porteous [8, 9] proves the
unitarity of the special linear group with the help of the double eld, which
corresponds to the null basis representation of the hyperbolic numbers.

there are various applications of hyperbolic numbers. they have been ap-
plied by reany [10] to 2nd-order linear dierential equations. a function theory
for hyperbolic numbers has been presented by motter and rosa [11]. extensions
to an n-dimensional space have been given by several authors [12, 13, 14, 15],
including an analysis of hyperbolic fourier transformations [16]. the functional
calculus of hyperbolic numbers is also covered by the more general approach of
superanalysis (see e.g. khrennikov [17]). considerations of a non-relativistic
hyperbolic hilbert space with respect to the born formula have been given by
kocik [18], khrennikov [19, 20], and rochon and tremblay [21]. xuegang et al.
investigated the dirac wave equation, cliord algebraic spinors, a hyperbolic
hilbert space, and the hyperbolic spherical harmonics in hyperbolic spherical
polar coordinates [22, 23, 24]. the hypercomplex numbers, and the geometries
generated by these numbers, have been investigated by catoni et al. [25]. fur-
ther applications of hyperbolic numbers, including e.g. their application to gen-
eral relativity by kunstatter et al., can be found in [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33].
it has been shown by baylis and jones [34] that a r3,0 cliord algebra has
enough structure to describe relativity as well as the more usual r1,3 dirac
algebra or the r3,1 majorana algebra. baylis represents relativistic space-time
points as paravectors and applies these paravectors to electrodynamics [35].
the approach to relativity in terms of r1,3 has been investigated by hestenes
[3, 36, 37], or e.g. by gull, lasenby, and doran [38]. an overview of the
structural dierences in the above low-dimensional cliord algebras is given by
dimakis [39] in the context of a general spinor representation within cliord
algebras.

the approach used in this work is congruent to baylis paravectors. however,
hyperbolic numbers are included in the algebra. this corresponds actually to
a hyperbolic complexication of the baylis algebra. according to porteous [9]
the resulting algebra is isomorphic to the three-dimensional universal complex
cliord algebra c 3,0. the correspondance to the baylis algebra is given by the
restriction to a subset of the algebra. this restriction can be justied in the
hyperbolic hilbert space by the hermiticity of the poincare mass operator [40].
it introduces beside the poincare mass
operator an analogeous operator for the spin, which is related to the pauli-
lubanski vector. in addition, the approach is extended to spherical symmetries.
the mathematical background of the presented approach with respect to the
classication of cliord algebras is not fully explained in [40, 41]. this will be
improved in this work based on the general overview given by porteous [8, 9].
the notation of porteous has been adopted in many cases.

this work is an extension of [41].

2 hyperbolic numbers

vector spaces can be dened over the commutative ring of hyperbolic numbers
z  h

z = x + iy + jv + ijw ,

where the complex unit i and the hyperbolic unit j have the properties

x, y, v, w  r ,

(1)

i2 = 1 ,

j2 = 1 .

(2)

the hyperbolic numbers dened in this way are a commutative extension of
the complex numbers to include new roots of the polynomial equation z2  1 =

2

in the terminology of cliord algebras they are represented by c 1,0, i.e.
0.
they correspond to the universal one-dimensional complex cliord algebra (the
notation follows porteous [9]).

beside the grade involution, two anti-involutions play a major role in the
description of cliord algebras and their structure, conjugation and reversion.
conjugation changes the sign of the complex and the hyperbolic unit

z = x  iy  jv + ijw .

(3)

the hyperbolic numbers with conjugation are equivalent to the double eld 2 c
of porteous, where  and the bar symbol denote swap and complex conjugation.
the notation of porteous has the advantage that it can clearly specify, whether
the double eld is dened over the real 2r, complex 2c, or quaternionic numbers
2q. if necessary the notation used in this work is extended to h(r), h(c) =
h, or h(q), where h(r) and h(q) correspond to the universal cliord
algebras r1,0 and r0,3, respectively.



with respect to the cliord conjugation the square of the hyperbolic number

can be calculated as

z z = x2 + y2  v2  w2 + 2ij(xw  yv) ,

(4)

i.e. in general the square of a hyperbolic number is not a real number.

beside the conjugation, the second important anti-involution is the reversion,

which changes only the sign of the complex unit

z = x  iy + jv  ijw .

(5)

anti-involutions reverse the ordering in the multiplication, e.g. (ab) = ba.
this becomes important when non-commuting elements of an algebra are con-
sidered. in physics, reversion is denoted as hermitian conjugation. note, that
in [40] it has been suggested to relate hermiticity in the physical sense to the
conjugation anti-involution.

3 hyperbolic algebra

consider a hyperbolic vector with the coordinates z = (z0, zi)  h
. the
bar symbol indicates that the vector has the signature (3, 1) in the hermitian
product with respect to conjugation, i.e. z z = z0 z0  zi zi. the vector can be
represented in terms of a cliord algebra as

3,1

z = ze .

(6)

the basis elements e = (e0, ei) include the unity and the pauli algebra multi-
plied by the hyperbolic unit j

e = (1, ji) .

(7)

the pseudoscalar of the hyperbolic algebra, which will appear thoughout this
work, is dened as

i = e0e1e2e3 = ij .

(8)

important for the further analysis is the behaviour of the above hypercom-
plex units under conjugation and reversion. in table 1 it is displayed whether

table 1: eect of conjugation, reversion, and graduation on the used hyper-
complex units.

the sign of the unit is changed or not under the considered operation. for com-
pleteness the graduation as an example of an important involution is displayed.

an involution does not change the ordering in a product, i.e. bab = ab. the

graduation is used to identify the even elements of a cliord algebra. a certain
subset of these elements denes the spin group of the considered cliord algebra
[9].

adding the hyperbolic unit to the pauli algebra corresponds in fact to a
hyperbolic complexication. in the terminology of cliord algebras the com-
plexication is leading to the isomorphisms

r3,0  h(r)  h(r)3,0  h(2)  c 3,0 .

(9)

the vector z of eq. (6) has sixteen real dimensions.

the full structure therefore corresponds to the universal three-dimensional com-
plex cliord algebra. the representation of the cliord algebra in terms of
matrices is given by h(2), the algebra of hyperbolic 2  2 matrices. this rep-
resentation will be assumed in some of the equations within this work.
in [40] it has been
shown that the four-dimensional real minkowski vector can be considered as the
magnitude of z, if the square is restriced to real numbers, i.e. z z  r. based
on the assumption that only such vectors are of physical relevance, the following
investigation is restricted to the real four-dimensional minkowski space, and the
remaining phase contributions are neglected. a minkowski vector x  r 3,1 is
expressed in the above algebra as x = xe.
the spatial vector contributions can be written explicitly in the following

representation

x = x0 + jx ,

(10)

where x = xii. using the pauli matrices as the explicit representation of i,
the vector x can be expressed in terms of a hyperbolic 2  2 matrix according
to

(11)

(12)

(13)

x =(cid:18) x0 + jx3

jx1 + ijx2

jx1  ijx2

x0  jx3 (cid:19) .

the scalar product of two vectors can be dened as

x  y =

1
2

(x y + y x) .

the wedge product is given as

x  y =

1
2

(x y  y x) .

4

the wedge product corresponds to a so-called biparavector, which can be used
e.g.
for the description of the electromagnetic eld or the relativistic angular
momentum (see also baylis [35]).

the basis elements of the relativistic c3,0 paravector algebra can be consid-
ered as the basis vectors of the relativistic vector space. these basis elements
form a non-cartesian orthogonal basis with respect to the scalar product dened
in eq. (12)

e  e = g ,

(14)

where g is the metric tensor of the minkowski space.

as an example of the paravector algebra the energy-momentum vector of a
free classical pointlike particle, moving with velocity v relative to the observer,
is expressed in the pauli algebra notation. the relativistic momentum vector
for this particle can be written as

p =

e
c

+ jp = mc exp (j) ,

(15)

with c denoting the velocity of light,  the rapidity, e the energy and p the
momentum of the particle. the rapidity is dened as tanh = v/c = pc/e,
where  = || and p = |p|. rapidity and momentum point into the same
direction n = v/|v| as the velocity. in the following c and h will be set equal to
one. in quantum mechanics the momentum is replaced in coordinate space by
the operators p = i.

4 lorentz transformations

porteous [9] shows that the general linear group can be considered as an unitary
group. the unitarity is related to the double eld together with an appropri-
-correlation. the
ate correlation. for the complex linear group this is a 2 c
, with swap  and conjugation, correponds to the null
complex double eld 2 c
basis representation of the hyperbolic numbers with conjugation h as given in
eqs. (1) and (3). in addition, there is an isomorphism between the general linear
group and the hyperbolic unitary group gl(n, c)  u (n, h), and in particular
for the special groups in two dimensions, i.e. sl(2, c)  su (2, h) (see also
hucks [7]). the unitarity of the group u (n, h) is understood with respect to a
h-correlation.

the group su (2, h) corresponds to the spin group of so(3, 1, r) and its
elements can be used to express rotations and boosts of the paravectors dened
in the last section. the rotation of a paravector can be expressed as [35]

x  x  = rx r .
for the boosts one nds the transformation rule

the rotations and boosts are given as

x  x  = bxb .

r = exp (i/2) ,

b = exp (j/2) .

5

(16)

(17)

(18)

based on the pauli matrices an explicit matrix representation of the boost
operator b can be given, e.g. for a boost in the direction of the x-axis one nds

b1 =(cid:18) cosh 1/2

j sinh 1/2

j sinh 1/2

cosh 1/2 (cid:19) .

(19)

the boosts are invariant under reversion b = b, whereas the conjugated boost
corresponds to the inverse b = b1. for rotations reversion and conjugation
correspond both to the inverse r = r = r1. this relationship indicates
that in non-relativistic physics hermitian operators can be dened either with
respect to reversion or conjugation.

boosts and rotations can be combined to form the lorentz transformation

which can be expressed in terms of its innitesimal generators as

x  x  = lxl ,
l = exp(cid:0)iiji  iiki(cid:1) .

(20)

(21)

(23)

from these equations the innitesimal generators of a lorentz transformation
can be identied as

j = /2 , k = ij/2 .

(22)

one can show that the generators satisfy the lie algebra of the lorentz group
so(3, 1, r). the lorentz transformations can be expressed also with relativistic
second rank tensors

l = exp (is /2) ,

where the spin angular momentum is dened in terms of the wedge product as

e  e = 2s .

(24)

the elements of the spin angular momentum therefore represent planes in space-
time that are formed by the basis elements of the algebra.

the following example shows how coordinate vector, momentum vector, or-
bital angular momentum and spin angular momentum can be related to each
other in the paravector algebra

(25)
where l = xp  xp corresponds to the relativistic orbital angular mo-
mentum.

x p = xp  isl ,

5 poincare mass operator

with the above vector representation the poincare mass operator can be intro-
duced as a product of a momentum vector and its conjugated counterpart

m 2 = p p .

(26)

the explicit form of the mass operator is obtained by a multiplication of the
basis matrices. the mass operator can be separated into a spin dependent and
a spin independent contribution

p p = pp  i pp ,

(27)

6

where the spin term is given by

 =

0

ij1
ij2
ij3

ij1
0
3
2

ij2
3
0
1

ij3
2
1
0

 .

(28)

since the spin contribution is anti-symmetric, the last term in eq. (27) is in
this case zero. the spin structure becomes important when interactions are
introduced by the minimal substitution of the momentum operators. the anti-
symmetric contribution  correponds to the wedge product of eq. (24), which
gives the analogous relation  = 2s.

the basic fermion equation is introduced as an eigenvalue equation of the
mass operator. with the hyperbolic algebra dened above the equation can be
written as

the wave function (x) has the general structure

m 2(x) = m2(x) ,

(x) = (x) + j(x) ,

(29)

(30)

where (x) and (x) can be represented as two-component spinor functions (see
hucks [7]). they depend on the four space-time coordinates x.

6 poincare spin operator

in analogy to the mass operator a spin operator can be introduced. the spin
operator corresponds to the second casimir operator of the poincare group,
which describes a system that is invariant under relativistic translations and
rotations. the basic equation for the spin operator can be dened as

s2(x) = s(s + 1)(x) ,
where the square of the spin operator corresponds to

s2 = w w /m2 .

(31)

(32)

the operator w denotes the pauli-lubanski vector, which can be expressed in
terms of the complex cliord algebra as

w = j  p  j (j p0 + k  p) .

(33)

the spatial spin operator can be derived from the pauli-lubanski vector by
projections (see michel [42] or wightman [43])

s =

1
m

w  n .

(34)

the projection vectors n are an arbitrary set of four orthogonal vectors satis-
fying the relation n  n = g . the spin operator takes the following form

s =

1

m(cid:18)j p0 + k  p  (j  p)

p

p0 + m(cid:19) ,

(35)

7

if the set of projection vectors is chosen as

n0 = m1(p0, pk) ,
ni = m1(pi, mik + pipk/(p0 + m)) .

(36)

the eigenstates of the spin operator can be introduced as eigenvectors of the
squared spin operator and of the z-component sz = s3

s2 | s ms i = s(s + 1) | s ms i ,
sz | s ms i = ms | s ms i .

(37)

to nd an explicit representation of these eigenstates one has to consider
that the spin operator in the above form can be obtained also with a boost
acting on the operator vector j

s = bj b .

(38)

therefore, the relativistic spinor can be related to the non-relativistic pauli
spinor by a boost

| s ms i = bms = u(p, ms) .

(39)

if the rapidity in the boost (see eq. (18)) is expressed in terms of the par-
ticle momentum, one nds that the boosted pauli spinor corresponds to the
hyperbolic representation of the dirac spinor

u(p, ms) =r p0 + m

2m (cid:18)1 +

jp

p0 + m(cid:19) ms .

(40)

the anti-particle spinor can be derived from the particle spinor, which is multi-
plied by the hyperbolic unit v(p, ms) = ju(p, ms). the spinors can be combined
with the hilbert space state for the momentum |pi to form the plane wave ex-
pansion

(x) = xms z

b(p, ms)

(41)

d3p

(2)32p0 (cid:16)u(p, ms)eipx

+ v(p, ms)eip x d(p, ms)(cid:17) ,

which is a general solution of the poincare mass operator and the poincare spin
operator (31).

2

the relativistic wave function is an element of the spinor space, which is a
minimal left ideal in the terminology of cliord algebras. the elements of a
minimal left ideal have rank 1 and therefore they can be represented as column
vectors i(x)  h
. the transformation rule of the spin operator in eq. (38) is
in contrast to eq. (17). the above rule is used for relativistic operators acting in
the spinor space. the transformation rule is related to the h-correlation, which
maps the elements of the spinor space to their dual space. since the poincare
mass operator and the poincare spin operator are operators in the spinor space
they have to obey the same transformation law. this is the reason why e.g. the
mass operator is dened as p p and not as p p .

8

7 massless particles

massless particles like neutrinos are normally described in terms of helicity
states. it is shown that massless particles can also be described with boosted
pauli spinors. representing particles in terms of pauli spinors corresponds to a
decoupling of the polarization axis and the direction of momentum. in explicit
calculations this decoupling is leading to ambiguities in the coupling of angular
momenta of multiple particles. therefore, e.g.
in calculations of scattering
amplitudes, the helicity basis is the best choice, even in a non-relativistic scheme.
from the theoretical point of view, massless particles that are represented
by pauli spinors provide a direct analogy to the description of the last section.
what has to be shown is that this representation is conform with the poincare
group in the massless case

m 2(x) = 0 .

(42)

if the polarization axis for a massive particle is chosen, e.g. as the z-axis, the
momentum can take any direction without any restriction. this is not the case
for massless particles. the spatial momentum can never be perpendicular to the
chosen polarization axis. the spatial symmetry of the momentum is therefore
broken, which will become apparent in the following equations.

the spinor will be dened within the little group of a standard vector [44].
since massless particles are moving with the velocity of light they have no rest
frame. therefore, the standard frame will be dened as the system in which the
momentum is directed along the polarization axis. if the particle is polarized in
the direction of the z-axis the positive-energy standard vector is given as

p = (|p3|, 0, 0, p3) .

(43)

in this description the helicity can be either positive or negative. the states
are always characterized by the two possible polarizations corresponding to the
chosen polarization axis. the components of the pauli-lubanski vector in the
standard frame are

w 0 = p3j 3 ,
w 1 = |p3|(j 1 + k 2) ,
w 2 = |p3|(j 2  k 1) ,
w 3 = |p3|j 3 .

(44)

the operators w 0 and w 3 are linear dependent and can be represented by
j 3. the three generators j 3, w 1 and w 2 satisfy the lie algebra of e2, the
euklidean group in two dimensions, which denes the little group of the m2 = 0
representation.

an arbitrary momentum vector p is obtained with a boost perpendicular to

the z-axis

p = (|p3| cosh  , |p3| n1 sinh  , |p3| n2 sinh  , p3) .

(45)

 = (n1, n2, 0) characterizes the direction of the boost. with
the unit vector ni
 = (p1, p2, 0) the rapidity can be dened
the perpendicular momentum vector pi
by the relation tanh  = p/p0, where p = |p|. using  = n the boost
can be written in the form b = exp (j/2). the momentum contribution
parallel to the polarization will be denoted as pi

k = (0, 0, p3), with pk = |pk|.

9

in the spinor representation the generators j = /2 and k = ij/2 can
be inserted into eq. (44). then one nds in the standard frame and therefore
in all frames w w = 0, i.e. the spin is given in the degenerate spin s = 0
representation of e2. the basis vectors are chosen as eigenvectors of j3 with
the eigenvalues ms =  1
2 . they can be represented with the pauli spinor ms.
a general spinor can be calculated using eq. (39) with the boost parameters
dened above

u(p, ms) =s p0 + pk

2pk (cid:18)1 +

jp

p0 + pk(cid:19) ms .

(46)

the antiparticle spinor is obtained if the above expression is multiplied by the
hyperbolic unit.

a set of four orthogonal projection vectors can be introduced to derive the

spin operator from the pauli-lubanski vector

n0 = p1

ni = p1

) ,

k (p0, pk
k (pi

, pkik + pi

pk

/(p0 + pk)) .

the spin operator is then dened as

s =

1
pk

w  n .

(47)

(48)

the spin operator corresponds again to a boosted vector of the angular momen-
tum generators j . explicitly written one nds

s =

1

pk(cid:18)j p0 + k  p  (j  p)

p

p0 + pk(cid:19) .

(49)

as mentioned above only the third component sz = s3 of the spin operator is
relevant within e2. for this component the last term in the above equation is
zero. the action of the spin operators on the spinor can be summarized in the
relations

s2 | 0 ms i = 0 ,
sz | 0 ms i = ms | 0 ms i ,

(50)

where the square of the spin operator corresponds to s2 = w w /p2
k. the plane
wave expansion is formally equivalent to eq. (41), but the spinors u(p, ms) and
v(p, ms) have to be replaced with the specic m2 = 0 form given above. from
these equations it follows that

s2(x) = 0 .

(51)

in fact, massless particles are also spinless particles. however, they can be de-
scribed by a non-zero momentum and a polarization comparable to the massive
particles.

10

8 maxwell equations

the maxwell equations can be derived from an eigenvalue equation of the mass
operator, where the mass operator is now acting on a vector eld

m 2a(x) = 0 .

(52)

the equation can be expressed with the electromagnetic elds according to

p p a =   e  0c

+ij  b
j(  b  0e  c)
i(  e + 0b) = 0 .

(53)

this expression is obtained if one evaluates p a(x), inserts the usual denitions
for the electromagnetic elds, and then multiplies the resulting terms by the
operator p . if p p is calculated rst, eq. (52) reduces to the wave operator
acting on the vector potential giving zero. both forms are equivalent in the
lorentz gauge.

in eq. (53) the four homogeneous maxwell equations are included. the

calculation provides two additional terms depending on

c(x) =  a(x) .

(54)

these terms disappear in the lorentz gauge.

9 photon plane wave states

in this section a plane wave expansion for free photon elds is derived. the
techniques developed for massless fermions will be applied. in this representa-
tion the polarization vector of the photon corresponds to a generalization of the
pauli spinor. again it is mentioned that the helicity basis has advantages in
explicit calculations.

the transformation properties of the vector components a(x) can be un-
derstood in terms of 4  4 transformation matrices acting on four-component
vectors

x  x = (l)

 x .

(55)

the transformation matrices can be derived from the generators ji and ki
according to eq. (21). the third components of the generators are

the results of section 7 will be used in the following. the standard frame is
the system in which the momentum is directed along the polarization axis. the
pauli-lubanski vector in the standard frame is given by eq. (44), where the

11

generators now have to be replaced by the generators of eq. (56), including the
remaining generator components.

the two eigenstates of j3 with eigenvalues ms = 1 are given as usual as


 = ( 

1  i

2 )/2,

(57)

(58)

1 and 

where 
2 are unit vectors in the direction of the x- and y-axis. in the
standard frame one nds that the squared spin operator acting on the eigenstates
is zero

(w w )

 

ms = 0.

 

general eigenstates of the spin operator are obtained again by a boost of
the eigenstate from the standard frame of the particle | 0 ms i = e(p, ms) =
(b)
ms. as in section 7 the direction of the boost is perpendicular to the
polarization axis, i.e. b = exp (ii
ki/2). the boost is performed with the
generators given in eq. (56). the calculation is leading to the explicit form of
the polarization vector

e(p, ms) =(cid:18) pms

pk

, i

ms +

pms
pi

pk(p0 + pk)(cid:19) ,

where p = (p1  ip2)/2. for the eigenstates one nds the relations

s2 | 0 ms i = 0 ,
sz | 0 ms i = ms | 0 ms i .

(59)

(60)

the spin operator sz = s3 is dened as in eq. (48) with the appropriate
generators for j and k. the above equations are equivalent to eq. (50) except
for the dierent eigenvalues. for photons one nds ms = 1. the plane wave
expansion of the free photon eld is given as

a(x) =xms z

d3p

(2)32p0 e(p, ms) e(cid:16)eipx

the plane wave satises the relation

a(p, ms) + eipx

the coordinate vector 

plays in this context the role of the pauli
spinor. it can be considered as an element of the minimal left ideal with respect
to the transformations induced by the generators of eq. (56). this is indicated
in the above formulas by the tensor indices. the indices can be omitted, e.g.
e(p, ms) = bms, to provide a representation free notation.

10 quadratic dirac equation

electromagnetic interactions can be introduced with the minimal substitution
of the momentum operator. the mass operator of eq. (26) transforms into

m 2 = (p  ea(x))( p  e a(x)) ,

(63)

12

and is now invariant under local gauge transformations. this mass operator
can be inserted into eq. (29). if pauli matrices and electromagnetic elds are
expressed with the anti-symmetric tensor  given in eq. (28) and f  =
a  a one nds

(cid:16)(p  ea)(p  ea) 

e
2

 f   m2(cid:17) (x) = 0 .

(64)

this is the quadratic dirac equation. using the hyperbolic algebra it can be
represented as a 2  2 matrix equation, whereas conventionally the quadratic
dirac equation is a 4 4 matrix equation. the spinor function (x) used for the
mass operator has a two-component structure, whereas in the dirac equation
(x) corresponds to a four-component spinor.

one nds in both cases the same two coupled dierential equations. for the

hyperbolic algebra one can derive from eq. (64)

in the dirac theory the spin tensor is dened according to  = i/2 [, ].
using this tensor the dirac form of eq. (65) can be written as

(cid:0)(p  ea)(p  ea)  e ijeii + ebii  m2(cid:1) (x) = 0 .
(cid:0)(p  ea)(p  ea)  e ieii + ebii  m2(cid:1) (x) = 0 .

comparing this equation with eq. (65) one observes that in both cases the term
including the electric eld is the only term which couples the components of the
spinor. in the mass operator equation the coupling term is proportional to j,
in the quadratic dirac equation the term corresponds to  = 5. the dirac
representation of 5 and j have the same eect on the spinor, a swap of the
spinor components. for the poincare mass operator one nds

(65)

(66)

whereas in the dirac representation the corrsponding relation is given as

j(x) = (x) + j(x) ,

5(x) =(cid:18) (x)

(x) (cid:19) .

(67)

(68)

in the hyperbolic formalism the terms proportional to the hyperbolic unit
include the dierential equation of the lower component, the other terms de-
scribe the dierential equation of the upper component. conventionally, the
coupled dierential equations for upper and lower components are separated by
the matrix structure.

11 orbital angular momentum and single parti-

cle potentials

the hyperbolic numbers can be used also for the description of the orbital angu-
lar momentum, which will be shown in this section (compare with xuegang [22]).
a spacelike relativistic vector x can be parametrized in relativistic spherical
coordinates as

x =

x0
x1
x2
x3

 =

 sinh 

 cosh  sin  cos 
 cosh  sin  sin 

 cosh  cos 

13

 .

(69)

the time coordinate is given as  sinh , where  > 0. in the limit of   0 the
vector reduces to a non-relativistic vector in spherical coordinates.
based on the lorentz transformation given in eqs. (55) and (56) the above
vector can be obtained from a standard vector x = (0, 0, 0, ) with the following
transformation

l(, , ) = exp (ij3  ) exp (ij2  ) exp (ik3  ) .

(70)

for an irreducible group representation of the orbital angular momentum the
relation between the generators of boosts and rotations is assumed to be the
same as for the spin ( 1
2 , 0) representation of the lorentz group used earlier in
this work

k = ijj.

(71)

the boost generator in eq. (70) can then be replaced by the third component
of the rotation generator

l(, , ) = exp (ij3  ) exp (ij2  ) exp (jj3  ) .

(72)

the orbital angular momentum will be denoted by l in contrast to the spin
angular momentum s. in the following equations j will be specialized to j = l.
the (l, 0) representation of the lorentz group provides the following equations
for the irreducible states

l2 | l ml i = l(l + 1) | l ml i ,
lz | l ml i = ml | l ml i .

(73)

again the third component is denoted as lz = l3. in this basis the transfor-
mation of eq. (70) is represented as
(, , ) = h l m
= eim

l | eil3  eil2  e jl3  | l ml i
l  d l
m

( ) e jml .

(74)

compared to the non-relativistic case the relativistic rotation matrices are ex-
tended by the additional hyperbolic phase factor e jml .

an application of these functions can be the solution of the poincare mass
operator with appropriate model potentials. a relativistic generalization of the
1/|x| central potential is suggested, which could be used to describe an electron
moving in the potential of a nucleus

ea(x) = 

z


(x) .

the polarization vector corrsponds to the unit vector of the -coordinate

(x) =

x(, , , ) =

sinh  sin  sin 

sinh  cos 

 .

(75)

(76)

in the static limit   0 this potential reduces to the 1/|x| potential.
some general remarks on the solution procedure will be given here. the -
terms in eq. (65) imply a coupling of the orbital angular momentum with the

14

spin j = l + s. there is also a term proportional to the hyperbolic unit which
has a dierent parity. the wave function (x) therefore has a similar structure
as the dirac spinor

with

(x) = l(x) + jl (x) ,

l =(cid:26) l  1

l + 1

for

l = j + 1/2
l = j  1/2

.

(77)

(78)

the eigenvalue of the coupled spin operator should not be confused with the hy-
perbolic unit in this equation. since relativistic single particle potentials depend
on the relative time, the energy of the single particle states is not a conserved
quantity. therefore, the following eigenvalue problem has to be considered

m 2 (x) = m2 (x) ,

(79)

where the solutions i(x) are eigenstates of the mass operator with the quantum
numbers i = (njlmj). given the model potential of eq. (75) the eigenvalues
m2
i of this equation should be close to the spectrum of the dirac equation with
a non-relativistic 1/|x| central potential. for the ground state gs = (1 1
2 0mj)
one can therefore expect to nd approximately

a detailed solution of this problem is beyond the scope of this work.

12 summary

the representation of relativistic quantum physics in terms of mathematical
structures is not unique. the relationships and isomorphisms between dier-
ent representations can be understood within cliord algebras as the common
underlying mathematical framework. the most popular representation of rel-
ativistic physics is based on the dirac algebra r1,3. however, the majorana
algebra r3,1, or the r3,0 algebra suggested by baylis, provide frameworks that
can be used for relativistic calculations as well.

the three-dimensional universal complex cliord algebra c 3,0 is proposed for
an alternative representation of relativistic quantum physics. the baylis algebra
is isomorphic to the subset of c 3,0 considered in this work. the structural
dierence appears in the shape of the hyperbolic unit. the full structure of
the complex c 3,0 cliord algebra provides sixteen real dimensions, the same
number as the dirac algebra, which is in contrast to the eight-dimensional baylis
algebra.

a relationship to other representations

the algebra introduced in eq. (6) seems to be identical to the r3,0 paravector
algebra of baylis [34, 35]. especially, if one considers the corresponding anti-
involutions in table 1 for the basis elements ei. however, baylis identies the
basis elements ei directly with the pauli algebra. in his approach the pauli alge-
bra therefore has dierent transformation properties under the anti-involutions
than in the approach presented here.

15

the hyperbolic algebra can be represented also in terms of quaternions as

e = (1, ij qi) ,

(81)

where qi  q denote the basis elements of the quaternion algebra. the three-
dimensional vector symbol x has been represented as xii, because the pauli
algebra is the one most familiar to physicists. it could be represented also as
xiei or as xiqi. it is possible to change from one picture to the other if ji is
replaced by ei or ijqi including a redenition of x.
