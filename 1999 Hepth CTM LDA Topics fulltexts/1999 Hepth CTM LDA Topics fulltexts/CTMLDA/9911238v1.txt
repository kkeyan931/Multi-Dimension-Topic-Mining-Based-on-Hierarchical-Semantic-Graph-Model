abstract

we discuss the full nonlinear kaluza-klein (kk) reduction of the
original formulation of d=11 supergravity on ads7  s4 to gauged max-
imal (n=4) supergravity in 7 dimensions. we derive the full nonlinear
embedding of the d = 7 elds in the d = 11 elds (the ansatz) and
check the consistency of the ansatz by deriving the d=7 supersymme-
try laws from the d=11 transformation laws in the various sectors. the
ansatz itself is nonpolynomial but the nal d = 7 results are polynomial.
the correct d = 7 scalar potential is obtained. for most of our results
the explicit form of the matrix u connecting the d = 7 gravitino to the
killing spinor is not needed, but we derive the equation which u has to
satisfy and present a solution. requiring that the expression f = da
in d = 11 can be written as d(f ields in d = 7), we nd the ansatz
for the 4-form f .
it satises the bianchi identities. the correspond-
ing ansatz for a modies the geometrical proposal by freed et al. by
including d = 7 scalar elds. a rst order formulation for the three
index photon a in d = 11 is needed to obtain the d=7 supersymme-
try laws and the action for the nonabelian selfdual antisymmetric tensor
eld s,a. therefore selfduality in odd dimensions originates from a
rst order formalism in higher dimensions.

1 introduction

the consistency of kaluza klein (kk) truncation at the nonlinear level of a mass-
less gravitational higher-dimensional eld theory to a massless gravitational lower-
dimensional eld theory has been a fundamental problem for a long time.
in this
article we present a complete solution for a particular model. namely, we consider
the original formulation of d=11 supergravity [1], without any string extensions, and
write all components of all d=11 elds, denoted by (y, x), as nonlinear expressions in
terms of the massless d=7 elds (y) and spherical harmonics y (x) on s4. all spher-
ical harmonics will be expressed in terms of (products of) killing spinors i (x) with
i = 1, ..., 4. hence we present below explicit expressions for (y, x) = ((y), (x)).
the consistency of this ansatz amounts to proving that the d=11 supersymmetry
variations of  produce the correct d=7 supersymmetry variations of . a particular
nonlinear combination of s and s enters as a 4  4 matrix u i
i (y, x). it appears
in the ansatz for all fermionic s and in the relation (y, x)  i(y)u i
i (y, x)i (x)
between the d=11 susy parameter (y, x) and the d=7 parameter (y). this matrix
u must satisfy a linear matrix equation, and we present explicit solutions. this is the
rst time a complete nonlinear kk reduction of an original supergravity theory to all
massless modes in a lower dimension has been given. there exists in the literature also
a modied version of d = 11 supergravity with a local su (8) symmetry and for this
theory de wit and nicolai [2, 3, 4, 5] have shown that the kk reduction is consistent.
because in their version of the theory the matrix u only described gauge degrees of
freedom, they did not try to determine it. (in an earlier study of the kk reduction
of the original d = 11 supergravity to d = 4 they gave partial results on the matrix
u [2, 3], but then they abandoned this project. in fact, the matrix u was rst intro-
duced in an implicit form in [6], while the contributions to u quadratic in scalars were
computed in [7]. other kk reductions to a subset of massless elds have also in some
cases been shown to be consistent [8, 9, 10, 11].

this article contains a detailed and self-contained derivation of our results, and is
an expanded version of a previous letter [12]. the basic problem we must analyze is
that in relations like (y)y (x) = (y, x)(y, x) one nds products of y (x)s on the
r.h.s. hence one must prove relations of the form y (x) = y (x). (an example of such
a relation is (4.30).) this requires a large number of properties of spherical harmonics.
for the reader who is not an expert in these matters we have added a special section
(section 3) in which we give a derivation of all identities we needed, starting from
scratch. the basic object, in terms of which we express all spherical harmonics, is the
killing spinor. it is a square root of a killing vector and is the spherical harmonic of
the local supersymmetry parameters. the spherical harmonics of scalars, spinors and
other elds are expressed into killing spinors. we shall analyze all bosonic variations
((y), (x)) up to terms with three d=7 fermion elds, and all fermionic variations
((y), (x)) up to terms with two d=7 fermion elds, but all results are to all orders
in bosonic elds. previous work in this area has also made the same restriction [3, 4, 5].
in principle one could also study the variations containing higher order in fermi elds
with our methods, but this is algebraically very complicated and given all small miracles
we have encountered in our work, we expect that consistency holds there as well.

initially, the aim of kk reductions of higher dimensional supergravities (sugras)
was to nd realistic eld theories in d = 4 dimensions, and the compactication on
ads4  s7 seemed promising ([13], see also [14]). however, it was later realized that it
was impossible to obtain in this way chiral fermions and/or a vanishing cosmological
constant [15]. recent developments in the ads-cft correspondence have renewed
interest in kk compactications on anti-desitter (ads) spaces [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]
(for a recent review see [23]).

while kk reduction (more precisely, truncation to the set of massless elds) on tori
is always guaranteed to be consistent, this is not in general so. a simple example of an
inconsistent truncation is einstein gravity, which cannot be truncated to gravity plus
gauge elds of the symmetry group k of the compact manifold mk . this was already
noticed by kaluza and others who studied the reduction from 5 to 4 dimensions. they
realized that the eld equation for the scalar contains source terms depending on the
gauge elds; hence setting the scalar to zero was inconsistent. but even keeping the
scalars in the theory is in general not enough to obtain consistency. in the einstein
 v 
equation, the terms involving the gauge elds will have as spherical harmonics v a
b ,
whereas the rest of the terms have spherical harmonic 1. however, if one restricts
the gauge group k to a subgroup k such that the subset of killing vectors satises
 v 
b , then the kk reduction is consistent (a, b  k) [8] (in sugra, more elds
v a
are present - for instance in 11 dimensions we have the antisymmetric tensor a -
and so the condition v a
b gets modied in a complicated way). in the case of
compactications on a group manifold and on spheres s4n+3, one can nd such subsets
of killing vectors, whereas on s2n one can not (as shown in [8]). for the maxwell-
einstein system, on the other hand, the truncation to massless elds is consistent as
far as the gauge symmetries are concerned [24].

b = a

the study of kk truncations took a new direction with the advent of supergravity.
the most intensively studied model was the n=8 sugra, which proved to be very chal-
lenging. in the course of its study, other criteria for consistent truncations were found
in [9, 25]. in [9] it was realized that for a eld theory invariant under a group g, a con-
sistent truncation can be obtained by retaining only all elds which are singlets under
a subgroup g  g. in general, this gives an innite set of elds (the untruncated set
is also innite). if g is the isometry group of the kk compactication on a space mk,
and g acts transitively on mk (i.e. any point in mk can be reached from any other
point by a g gauge transformation), the subset of elds is nite. this requirement
implies in particular that mk is a coset manifold, g/h = g/h. in the case of the
ads4  s7 compactication, this mechanism gives a group theoretical explanation for
the consistency of a particular truncation consisting of massless gauged n=3 super-
gravity coupled to some massive matter multiplets (this system is not contained in
n=8 sugra). in [25] it was claimed that the truncation to 4d n  1 sugra multiplets
with second order formulation for the elds is always consistent, and it was speculated
that the truncation to a sugra multiplet is always consistent.

the study of the consistency of the kk reduction of d=11 sugra at the nonlinear
level was tackled in a series of papers by de wit and nicolai. in their pioneering work,
they followed two approaches. one was to construct directly an ansatz for the 11d
metric as opposed to the vielbein; this yielded an ansatz for the fermions only up to a
matrix u, depending on the 4d scalar elds. the dependence of this matrix on one of

3

the scalars was even determined, but they did not succeed in nding the dependence on
all other scalars. they then switched to another approach in which they reformulated
11d sugra as a theory with a local so(1, 3)su (8) tangent space symmetry group, and
dimensionally reduced this theory. this latter approach was used to prove consistency
of the reduction by reproducing the 4d susy transformations laws and equations of
motion, but left the ansatz of the original 11 dimensional elds in terms of the 4d
ones implicit. the ansatz for f was not explicitly given in the rst approach. in
the second approach no f appears, but the equations needed to construct f
from the second approach were highly involved.

lately, suggested by the need to embed ads4 and ads7 black holes as solutions
of 11 d sugra (and ads5 black holes as solutions of 10d iib sugra), the authors of
[10, 11] proposed nonlinear ansatze for the embedding in 11d sugra and 10d iib sugra
of a further truncation of the gauged sugras in 4, 7 and 5 dimensions to a set of u(1)
gauge elds and scalars (in the ads7 case, two u(1) gauge elds and two scalars).
the consistency of the truncations was proven by reproducing the lower dimensional
equations of motion from the ones of d=11 and d=10 sugras (see next section). after
that, a series of other papers looked at other truncations of 11d sugra on ads7  s4
(a model with one scalar, one su(2) gauge eld and one antisymmetric tensor in [26],
a model with 4 scalars in [27]). consistent truncations of bosonic subsets of elds to
other dimensions were also considered in [28, 29, 30, 31].

in a previous letter [12], we have given the full nonlinear ansatze for the kk reduc-

tion of 11d sugra on ads7  s4. here we present the details of the construction.
crucial for the proof of consistency is a proper understanding of the origin of the
concept of self-duality in odd dimensions  seven in this case. in sugra, this mechanism
of selfduality in odd dimensions leads to a consistent coupling of a multiplet of massive
antisymmetric tensor elds to nonabelian gauge elds. it was rst discovered in a study
of the kk reduction of d=11 sugra on s4 [32], and found to give a formulation dual to
chern-simons theory for the abelian case [33], but not for the nonabelian case [34]. it
was found that the second order eld equation for the eld a,a, which one obtains
fom kk reduction of the eld a, was of the form a + m2a + ma = 0. adding
an auxiliary eld b,a with action b2, a rotation from a,b to s,b yielded the nal
massless eld s,a and a massive mode b,a,

a = s + b, b = b  o(s + b)

(1.1)

where o is an operator involving derivatives of the form d + m, see (2.41). we have
found that b is obtained by kk reduction of the auxiliary eld b in d=11, which
is obtained by using a rst-order formulation for the 3-index photon in d=11.

the paper is organized as follows. in section 2.1 we discuss the issue of the consis-
tency of kk truncations in general. we argue that it is sucient to obtain the susy
transformation laws of the dimensionally reduced theory from the susy transformation
laws of the untruncated theory. in section 2.2 we present d=11 sugra with a rst-order
formulation for the 3-index photon a,a, and prove its local supersymmetry. the
linearized kk reduction is given in section 2.3. although it was already given in [35],
we summarize it here since it forms a starting position for the nonlinear extension. in
section 3 we discuss killing spinors and spherical harmonics. we begin with a descrip-
tion of the spherical harmonics used for the massless multiplet in section 3.1 and give

4

various useful identities in section 3.2. section 4 is the heart of this paper: it contains
the proof of the consistency of kk reduction. in 4.1 we present the full ansatz for the
d=11 vielbein and gravitino and we discuss the susy transformation laws of the viel-
bein. in 4.2 we derive an ansatz for the d=11 3-index antisymmetric tensor eld a
by a partial analysis of the susy laws for a and by a preliminary study of the susy
transformation laws of the gravitino. it leads to the d=7 self-duality in odd dimen-
sions. in 4.3 we give the reduction of the rest of the d=11 gravitino transformation
laws and derive the transformation law of the 3-index d=7 tensor s,a. in section
5 we derive for completeness the seven dimensional bosonic equations of motion from
the 11 dimenisonal bosonic equations of motion, with the gauge elds set to zero. we
also derive the seven dimensional bosonic action and compare our ansatz with other
ansatze for consistent truncation to bosonic subsets of elds. we nish in section 6
with conclusions and discussion. in appendix 1 we give our conventions and some use-
ful relations for dirac matrices, including certain completeness relations. in appendix
2 we give some details of the charge conjugation matrices in various dimensions and
properties of modied majorana spinors.

2 first-order d=11 supergravity and linearized
kk reduction

2.1 kk consistency

let us briey discuss the issue of the consistency of the kk reduction.
in general,
if we truncate the elds in a lagrangian by putting the massive ones {(n)} to zero
and keeping only the massless ones {(0)}, we have to check that the full equations of
motion and transformation laws (for all the symmetries of the system) are consistent
under this truncation.

more precisely, the equations of motion of the massive elds, s/(n) must not
contain any term depending only on the massless elds (at the linear level this is
true because (n) are eigenfunctions of the kinetic operator) because otherwise setting
(n) = 0 would be inconistent. similarly, in the transformation rules for the symmetries
of the system, the massive elds should not transform into only massless ones, again
because then we cannot put the massive elds to zero.

in the case of the kk reduction of a d dimensional sugra action, s(d)({}), we
usually know the lagrangian in lower (d) dimensions s(d)({(0)}) which we should
obtain after truncation, but we need to nd the nonlinear ansatz which species how
the nal massless elds (0) are embedded in the higher-dimensional elds . for a
consistent truncation, there should be no term linear in massive elds in the untrun-

cated action r ddx(n)fn({(0)}), because such a term would give an inconsistency of
the equations of motion. lets assume that both the equations of motion and the susy
laws are inconsistent, i.e. there exists a massive eld which varies into a term involv-
ing only massless elds, (n) = gn({(0)})+ more. if we can reproduce the correct
d-dimensional susy laws from the d dimensional susy laws, the variation of the term
in the action which is linear in massive elds gives an extra piece depending only on

5

massless elds:

s(d)({(n)},{(0)}) = s(d)({(0)}) +z gn({(0)})fn({(0)}) + o((n)) = 0 (2.1)
since the d-dimensional theory is invariant, s(d)({0}) vanishes. hence, for consis-
tency gnfn = 0, i.e. the equations of motion and susy laws cant both contain purely
massless terms for a given massive eld. since the commutator of the susy transfor-
mations gives the equations of motion, the two inconsistencies are presumably always
equivalent. therefore one criterion for a consistent truncation is to nd a nonlinear
ansatz which gives the susy transformation laws of s(d) from the susy transformation
laws of s(d).

in [10, 11] the consistency of the kk reduction from the original d = 11 supergravity
to ads(7)  s4 to a small subset (two scalars and two u (1) gauge elds) of our elds
was studied using the other criterion, namely consistency of the eld equations. only
bosonic elds were considered. more recently, this work has been extended to other
subsets of bosonic elds (a model with one scalar, one su(2) gauge eld and one
antisymmetric s, [26] and a model with only 4 scalars [27]). we do not restrict our
atttention to subsets, and consider both fermionic and bosonic elds. for completeness
we shall also consider consistency of the bosonic eld equations.

2.2 supergravity and rst order formulations

and a and b are free parameters. they will be xed by the requirement of consistency
of the kk truncation on s4.

by replacing the term 24f a in (2.2) by f f , the terms ( ) f get absorbed. then the f eld
equation reads f = f and becomes supercovariant. we have not been able to absorb the remaining four-
fermi terms by using our new rst order formulation.

first order formulations in sugra have been given before in d=4. soon after the n=1
sugra was formulated with a second order for the spin connection [36], a rst order form
for the spin connection (with an independent eld mn
)
was given [37]. for d=11 sugra, a rst-order formulation for the spin connection was
given in [38].

and an expression for mn





the reason we start with a rst order formulation for the antisymmetric tensor eld
in d=11 is that at the linearized level one needs in 7 dimensions a 3-index auxiliary eld
to combine with the 3 index tensor to give the 7 dimensional supergravity eld s,a
found in [39]. since the 3-index auxiliary eld can also be written as a 4-index auxiliary
eld by a duality transformation, this suggested to us that the auxiliary eld in d=11
gives by reduction the auxiliary eld in d=7. our results conrm this suggestion.

could we have chosen another rst order formulation which would give us at the
linearized level this auxiliary eld? the other obvious choice is the rst order formula-
tion for the spin connection (palatini formalism). the auxiliary eld is obtained as the
totally antisymmetric part of the dierence between the independent spin connection
and the solution of its equation of motion, i.e.

b = ([

(2.24)

when we dimensionally reduce, we obtain an auxiliary antisymmetric tensor eld b.
we will see later (in section 3) that this approach does not produce the 7 dimensional
auxiliary eld we need.

2.3 linearized kaluza-klein reduction on s4

any 11 dimensional eld is written as a sum of the corresponding background eld and
the uctuations. in the uctuations we keep only massless modes, i.e. elds which
in 7 dimensions belong to the maximal (n=4) sugra multiplet. in full generality, the
massless 7 dimensional elds may occur nonlinearly in the expansion of 11 dimensional
elds.

the linearized terms in the expansion of the bosons have the generic form

(y, x) = xi

,i (y)y i

 (x)

(2.25)

where  are 7 dimensional elds and y are spherical harmonics. the 7 dimensional
indices are attached to 7 dimensional elds, 4 dimensional indices to the spherical
harmonics y of the internal space. for fermions one nds a similar decomposition,

a(y, x) = xi

i (y)y i,a

where the spinor index a=1,32 of an 11 dimensional spinor decomposes as a = a  a
with a spinor indices on ads7 and a spinor indices on s4. we shall suppress these
spinor indices , and thus a and a will not be used below.

the linearized ansatz has been given in [35]. we reproduce it here for completeness.

where the scalars sijkl are in the 14 representation of usp(4) and ijkl

symplectic trace and its totally antisymmetric part vanish (see below (3.6) and (3.7)).

traces are zero. by denition, 5 = i1

2 (1 + i5), see appendix 1.

we took the scalars to be in the 14 representation and the spinors in the 16
representation because of the following reason. first, the total number of scalars has
to be 14, and the total number of fermions 16, a fact which we know for instance from
the case of toroidal compactication. second, the complete mass spectrum on s4 was
found in [43], and the lowest mass modes are the singlet and the 14. the singlet has
bigger mass, and is found to belong to another multiplet. the spinors have as lowest
modes a 4 and the 16, but again the 4 has higher mass and belongs to the same
multiplet as the scalar singlet.

the gravitini  also have to be redened in order to diagonalize their kinetic term:

when massive modes are put to zero, one would expect that a,ij is equal to
the 7 dimensional supergravity eld s,ij . however, the eld a,ij has an action
with 2 derivatives, whereas the action of s,ij is linear in derivatives. that means
that we need to introduce by hand an auxiliary eld b,ij , and rotate the a and b
elds such that the sum of the action of a with 2 derivatives and the action of b with
none gives two decoupled actions each linear in derivatives, one for s,ij and one
for a massive eld b, which we set to zero. after setting the massive eld to zero, the
dependence of the auxiliary eld b,ij on s,ij reads

b,ij =

(s,ij +

 ds,ij )

(2.41)

note that if we want to understand b as coming from a kk reduction, its spherical
harmonic should be the same as for the eld a. in general two elds in lower dimensions
with the same index structure cannot have the same spherical harmonic, but in our case
b and a have dierent mass dimensions, and therefore can have the same spherical
harmonic.

3 spherical harmonics and killing spinors

3.1 spherical harmonics present in the massless multiplet
the coset representatives of a reductive coset manifold l(z) = exp(xk) satisfy
the equation l1dl = eaka + ihi. hence dl1 = (l1dl)l1 from which one
obtains (d + ihi)l1 = (emkm)l1. using the spinor representation of so(5)
with hi = 1
4 [m, n] and km = icm we dene i (x)  l1i (0) where i (0) is a
constant spinor with i (0) = i . (the index  is a spinor index and runs from
1 to 4, while  is a constant antisymmetric 4  4 matrix. we suppress the spinor
index  in most of the text.) in general, the dierence between ihi and the spin
connection term 1/2 (spin)a
ab is dened by [ka, kb] =
bbb +b  d) [41]. for a treatment of spherical
cab
harmonics on s4 and on general coset manifolds, see [42, 43]. since s4=so(5)/so(4)
is a symmetric manifold, cab

d = 0 and thus ihi is the spin connection.

one is easy to check. a direct consequence of the second equation is a completeness
type of relation satised by the killing spinors

one could directly verify the killing equation by constructing the vielbein em and spin
connection i from l1dl, expressing l in terms of a cosine and sine, as in (3.11), and
substituting into (3.1)

all spherical harmonics can now be built from killing spinors:

the relative factors 1/3 in (3.5) and 1 in (3.8) are not xed by properties of the spherical

equations of motion at the linearized level [35].

we have now 3 dierent coordinate systems on s4: the coset coordinates x, the
euclidean coordinates y a and the stereographic coordinates . we shall mostly use
the euclidean coordinates y a, but note that the explicit expressions for the killing
spinors (which we do not use) are simplest in stereographic coordinates.

the scalars y a parameterizing the sphere in a 5 dimensional space satisfy the

identity

it follows that

it is easy to check that

y aya = 1

y a d ya = 0, or y aca = 0

d

d y a =  g y a

hence we obtain the completeness relation

d y a d ya =g , or c a

another useful identity is

d y a d



y b + y ay b = ab

(3.18)

(3.19)

(3.20)

(3.21)

(3.22)

it follows by using that my a = c a

5 form an orthogonal 5 5 matrix
according to (3.18), (3.19) and (3.21). we also give another proof because it illustrates
the techniques we will use. acting with d on both sides of (3.22); the r.h.s. is then
zero trivially, and the l.h.s. is zero upon using (3.20). so the l.h.s. is constant, and at
x=0, where i = i , we obtain

m and y a  c a

d y a|x=0 =
y a|x=0 =

t r(ci5a ) = a
t r(c5a ) = a

this proves (3.22).

in the same way one may prove that

 = y [a d y b]
v ab

(3.23)

(3.24)

namely one may show that the r.h.s. satises the killing vector equation, d( v ab
) = 0,
by using (3.20) and the antisymmetry in ab. the proportionality constant is xed by
taking x = 0 for a particular case, e.g. a=5, b=. using the denition of v ab
, the
l.h.s. gives at x=0  1

2 g , and the r.h.s. gives with (3.23) also  1

2 g .



similarly, we may derive

4qgy [a1y a2] = +i  5j (a1a2)ij

(3.25)

to prove this, we act with d on the last term and get +ii 5j (a1a2)ij . we
obtain the same result if we act with d on the rst term. at x=0, using (3.23), the

14

l.h.s. gives 4qga1a2 and the r.h.s. gives t r(c5a1a2 ). evaluating the trace

one nds that both results are equal. this proves (3.25).

(3.31)

and integrals of any even number of y as will be proportional to symmetrized products
of delta functions in a similar way. integrals of an odd number of y as will give zero.
see also the appendix in [22]. a basic identity which we will use repeatedly is given
by

a1...a5 = 5qgy [a1...y a4y a5]

(3.32)

m and c a

it also follows from the fact that c a
5 form an orthogonal matrix. another
proof is obtained by acting with d on both sides. the l.h.s. gives zero, and because
of (3.20), on the r.h.s. when d hits the y s or y a5 gives zero by antisymmetry.
being constant, the r.h.s. should be proportional to the l.h.s., and the proportionality
constant is xed by looking at x=0. at x=0, i = i , so from (3.23) we get on the

r.h.s. 5qg[a1...a4 5a5]= a1...a45a5 +a2...a55a1 +...+a5...a15a4 = a1...a5.

by repeatedly using (3.18),(3.19),(3.21), one derives from (3.32) the following fur-

ther identities

a1...a5dy a1 = 4qgdx y [a2y a3y a4y a5] (3.33)

a1...a5dy a1  dy a2 = 3qgdxdx y [a3y a4y a5]
a1...a5dy a1  dy a2  dy a3 = 2qgdx  dx  dxy [a4y a5]

= 2qgdx  dx  dxv [a4a5] (3.35)

(3.34)

(3.36)

a1...a5dy a1  ...  dy a4 = qgdx  ...  dxy a5

the l.h.s. has to be an invariant tensor of so(5) with 2 indices because the haar measure d4xq 

g on s4
is so(5) invariant. this allows only ab. the constant of proportionality is found by taking a trace with
ab.

15

contracting these identities with y a5, leads to a further chain of identities.

a1...a5dy a1  ...  dy a4y a5 = qgdx  ...  dx

a1...a5dy a1  dy a2  dy a3y a5 = qgdx  dx  dxy a4
a1...a5dy a1  dy a2y a5 = qgdxdx y [a3y a4]

(3.37)

(3.38)

(3.39)

(3.41)

a1...a5dy a1y a5 = qgdx y [a2y a3y a4] (3.40)

a1...a5y a5 = qgy [a1...y a4]

the last identity follows from (3.32). as a check on the normalization of the identities
(3.33) to (3.41), we consider the point x=0 and use (3.23). for example, the l.h.s. of
(3.35) yields a1...a5a1

 which agrees with 2
[a4

5
a5] on the r.h.s.

 a3

 a2

by fierz rearrangements, we get other identities. fierzing [k (j]i ), we get

5i jk

5  5i c jk

 = 4[k j]i  i jk

(3.42)

from which we retrieve (3.22) after multiplying with l. fierzing (k (j)i ), we obtain

i v jk

 i (j k ) = 4(k j)i

(3.43)

in particular, (3.42) will be heavily used.

4 derivation of the complete nonlinear kaluza
klein reduction.

4.1 the dimensional reduction of the 11 dimensional gravi-
ton transformation law

with the tools developed in the previous section, we turn to the main problem of this
article, nding the complete nonlinear kaluza-klein ansatz.

for completeness, we give below the action and transformation laws of the dimen-
sionally reduced theory, namely maximal gauged sugra in d = 7. the model has a
local so(5)g gauge group for which a,b,... =1,5 are vector indices, while i,j,... =1,4
i parameterize the coset sl(5, r)/so(5)c but in
are spinor indices. the scalars a
the gauged model the sl(5, r) rigid symmetry of the action is lost and replaced by
the so(5)g gauge invariance. the indices i,j,...=1,5 are so(5)c vector indices and
i, j,...=1,4 are spinor indices. the model has the following elds: the vielbein e
a,
i, the antisym-
the 4 gravitinos i
 , the so(5)g vector bab
metric tensor s,a and the spin 1/2 elds i
i (vector-spinors under so(5)c, satisfying
ii
i = 0). they have the correct mass-terms which ensure masslessness in d=7 ads

at the nonlinear level, we need an ansatz for the vielbein rather than the metric as
we did in section 2.3. the ansatz for the vielbein em
 is constructed as follows. in order
to x the o-diagonal part of the lorentz group and remain with local so(6, 1)so(4)
invariance, we impose the gauge choice ea
 = 0. the natural extension of the rescaling
in (2.27), needed to obtain the usual einstein action, with no extra powers of , is :

ea

(y, x) = ea

(y)1/5(y, x), (y, x)

(4.8)

this is a standard result in kk reduction of theories with gravity. the ansatz for
em

 (y, x) is also standard. it contains the gauge bosons

 (y, x) = b
b
(y, x) = 2bab

(y, x)em

 (y, x)

 (y)v ab(x)

(4.9)

(4.10)

 (y) is the 7 dimensional so(5) gauge eld and v ab the corresponding
where bab
killing vector. the factor of (-2) in the ansatz of b
 comes from g = 2m, and the
minus sign is related to the sign convention in the denition of the covariant derivative
d =  + gb. the only nontrivial step is nding an ansatz for em
 .

before we do that, lets analyze the fermions. the gravitinos m  e

m  split
into a  e
m (we suppress the 32- dimensional spinor index.) in
order to obtain diagonal kinetic terms for the fermions in d = 7, we proceed analogously
to the vielbein and begin by introducing elds a(y, x) and m(y, x) as follows:

a  and m  e

a = 1/10(5)pa  a
m = 1/10(5)qm

a5m1/10(5)qm

 = 1/10(5)p,  = 1/10(5)p

substituting this ansatz for a and m into the 11d action, and requiring that the
action for  and m becomes diagonal we nd that a=+1 and p =  1
2 , q =  1
2
(four combinations). however, by trying to match the 7 dimensional transformation
laws, we will nd that only p = q works. the freedom in the sign of p, q corresponds
to a rescaling of all elds by 5. this freedom will be xed in the following by the

more generally, when dimensionally reducing a d dimensional supergravity theory to d dimensions, one

requirement of consistent truncation. we will nd that only p = q = 1/2 works. (see
for instance (4.142) below.) incidentally we note that in the linearized ansatz used in
[35] the other sign was chosen. since in [35] only the leading fermionic transformation
laws were studied, it did not matter at that point which rescaling by 5 was used.

we also note that the rotation in (4.11, 4.12) is the only one which diagonalizes the
action for the seven dimensional gravitini and spin 1/2 fermions. if we try the more
general rotation

a = a(5)pa + b am(5)qm
m = c(5)rm + dm(5)s aa

(4.18)

by requiring a diagonal kinetic action for the gravitino and spin 1/2 fermions we recover
(4.11) and (4.12).

5

in the eld redenitions, 1/2

in  is needed to cancel the 5 coming from  =
   5 in the gravitino action; 1/10 is needed to bring the gravitino action to
the usual rarita-schwinger form with no extra powers of  (which would come from
dete = dete(7)17/5det e
); nally, the rotation of a, m into a, m is needed to
cancel the mixed terms mdm. since  = d+ more, we need factors 1/2
and 1/10 in . for the linearized case we reobtain (2.31).

so(5) matrix in the spinor representation depending on the scalar elds in 7 dimensions
i). de wit and nicolai [2] found it necessary to add a u matrix for consistency of
(a
the truncation of the susy transformation laws, and we shall nd the same need (see
below (4.30)). one can either rotate the label index i or the spinor index of the killing
spinors. we choose the former, which is perhaps more natural, since the fermions have
an so(5) composite index, whereas the killing spinors have naturally an so(5) gauge
index. de wit and nicolai took the alternative rotation of spinor indices by u because
they reformulated d=11 sugra in a form with local su(8) invariance parameterized by
an arbitrary u (x, y), and in d=11 there are only spinorial indices are available. when
one compacties, the d=11 su(8) invariance is xed, only the 4d part remains unxed.
there is a dierence between the gauge u = 1 which gives the usual d=11 sugra (in
the triangular gauge ea
 = 0) and the gauge needed for s7 compactication. therefore,
the gauge xing produces also for us a given eld-dependent matrix u (y, x) which acts
on the killing spinors.

in d=7 one can always make so(5)c gauge transformations on the fermions, and
this would modify the y dependence of u (y, x) by a gauge factor. as we shall see in
(4.22), consistency of our results for the transformation rules requires the matrix u to
satisfy the condition

i ij u j

j = ij  (   u t  )i
u i
(so that u u t =  ; u t u = )

i = (u1)i

i

(4.19)

the need for this relation will occur in various other places as well. since  is the
charge conjugation matrix (see appendix 1), and  = 1 this proves that u is a
so(5) matrix in the spinor representation. (namely, an sp(4) matrix, since  is a
symplectic metric).

with the expression in 7 dimensional gauged supergravity. the result is given in (4.29).

we should now check if with our ansatz for the vielbein in (4.28) we also reproduce
the second term in the transformation law (4.25) of the gauge eld. we already know at
this point e

to v ab

r.h.s. of (4.24). they can be rewritten as follows

since m

observations the determinant can be evaluated and yields (2)2. hence we obtain

(4.54)

equation (4.54) will turn out to be the most important tool in our endeavor to nd

a consistent truncation of the 11 dimensional supergravity.

at this point we have come in 7 dimensions as far as de wit and nicolai in their
rst approach without a local su(8). (actually, a relation corresponding to our (4.54)

24

is not present in their work, but they did nd the one corresponding to (4.30).) we
have been able to nd solutions for u without having to extend the d=11 theory. first
of all, we have been able to show that (4.30) follows from (4.54), so that (4.54) is the
crucial equation. secondly, we found solutions to (4.54).

the proof that (4.54) implies (4.30) goes as follows. one begins with the l.h.s. of

where one substitutes (3.29) to sum over the killing vectors. using v,ab = y [ac b]

and writing 2ij = ij  ji, the r.h.s. of (4.54) appears, and using (4.54) we obtain

in the product of gamma matrices only the term bc d survives due to symmetry

what is left to do is the sum over d (use (a.12)) in order to get directly the r.h.s. of
(4.30) (with ij written again as ij  ij ).
u can be expanded in the complete basis 1, a, ab,

finally, we look at the solutions of equation (4.54) for the matrix u . the matrix

u = n + naa + nabab

(4.58)

then, the condition that it is an so(5) matrix in the spinor representation, equation
(4.19), says that

(4.61)

(4.62)

(4.63)

(4.64)

(4.65)

(4.66)

(4.67)

the fact that u u1 = u1u = 1l gives then the conditions

ab = 1

1

25

the rst observation is that if u is an so(5) solution of u y/ = v/u then also u y/ is
a solution. but we want solutions which are equal to 1 on the background, so we will
disregard the solutions which are equal to y/ on the background. from (4.66) we get
that

whereas by multiplying (4.67) with yb + vb we get

n =

2nabvayb
1  v  y

na =

abcdevbycnde

1  v  y

+ n ya + va
2(1 + v  y )

this satises (4.65) automatically. if we take n 6= 0 (discarding solutions which are
not equal to 1 on the background), then from (4.61) we get that

so the solutions which are equal to 1 on the background are parameterized by an

(4.76)

it is very hard to see what the general solution for this equation is. we have found
some solutions, but have nothing to say about the general solution. in principle, the
most general solution could be obtained by noting that in 5d space we have, besides
ya and va, another 3 independent vectors z1, z2, z3. we can then make out of them
an orthonormal set, also orthogonal to y and v. then the most general solution for
nab will be written as

nab =

i } = {y a, va, z a

where {x a
3 }. however, the resulting equations for amn and
amnp are quite involved. we will look at particular cases. we note that the covariant
vectors at our disposal are of the form

1 , z a

2 , z a

x (z)

i =

[(1)z]i
y  t z  y

(4.78)

i 6= i

a, then the x (z)s will generate the whole sphere (they will
where z  z and if a
not lie in a lower dimensional hyperplane), so we can build z1, z2, z3 out of 3 suitably
chosen x (z)
s (z 6= 0, 1). but the simplest possibility is still that we build u only out
of y a and va. then nab = av[ayb], so that n = a(1 + v  y ) and na = 0. the
normalization condition (4.60) xes then a = (2(1 + v  y )1/2. the unique covariant
solution built out of only ya and va then reads
1 + v  y + vaybab

1 + v/y/

(4.79)

v/ + y/
1 + v  y
another simple type of solution is nab = a z [a
z b]
2 , where z1, z2 are arbitrary unit
1
vectors. then (4.62) says that n na = 0 and if we concentrate on n 6= 0, we get
na = 0. then (4.67) says that z [a
2 (y  v)c] = 0, so that nab = a(y  v)[ax b],
with x an arbitrary unit vector and a determined from (4.60). we get

(ya + va)

21  v  y + 2x  y x  v

(4.81)

we can easily check that if ~x is in the (y,v) plane we reproduce u(1). however,
now we can take x to be a noncovariant vector, which we can take to be x = (~0, 1).
then

unoncov =

5y/ + v/5

21  v  y + 2y5v5

which can be written as an exponent

y5 + v5  im(ym  vm)

(4.82)

u = exp[im(y m  vm)u];
u = [(y m  vm)2]1/2 arctan p(y m  vm)2

y 5 + v5

(4.83)

we can also generate the most general noncovariant solution made out of only y a

and va, by choosing

x =

y + v + (~0, 1)

p1 + 2 + 2 + 2v  y + 2y5 + 2v5

(4.85)

where  = /( + 1) is an arbitrary parameter. we note that taking  to innity, we
get the maximally noncovariant solution unoncov. we quote a few other solutions for
nab in order to show that u(1) is not the most general covariant solution.

from (4.28) and (4.54) we obtained a suggestion for the vielbein itself. squaring
this result led to an expression for the metric g . it is easier to check the result for
g by directly verifying that it is the inverse of g in (4.37).

4.2 the ansatz for the 11 dimensional antisymmetric ten-
sor and auxiliary eld and self-duality in odd dimensions

at this point we have obtained the complete nonlinear ansatz for the metric and the
gravitino and we checked the transformation rules of the d=7 bosonic elds which are
embedded in the d=11 vielbein, viz. the graviton, the gauge elds and the scalars. we
now turn to the antisymmetric tensor a.

we begin by presenting the nal for form for our ansatz for the kk reduction on
s4 of the eld strength f; a discussion of how we arrived at this result will be
given afterwards.

the independent uctuation, a, mixes with the auxiliary eld

b = k

 b

where k is an arbitrary scale factor which will be xed below (see below (5.31). all
the other components of b are set to zero because in d=11 they vanish on-shell,
but in order that they also vanish on d=7 on-shell, they would have to be of the form
2, leading to 4 terms in the action. in principle, the other components of b still
depend on the eld equation for s because that one is linear in derivatives. however,
this produces incorrect answers for the susy transformation rules of the fermions.

the mixing of a,a with b,a is needed to convert the second order eld equa-
tion obeyed by a,a into the rst order one obeyed by the antisymmetric tensor eld
of 7 dimensional gauged sugra, s,a.

the ansatz for f which we obtained by requiring consistency of susy laws is
the same as the geometrical ansatz of [45] if the scalars are set to zero. one would
expect that this should be the case, since the ansatz proposed by the authors of [45]
was constructed such that the chern-simons terms in the 7-dimensional action are
obtained after integrating the chern-simons term of the 11-dimensional action on s4.
the purely scalar sectors in f are components of a separately closed form. we
note that any closed form f(4) which appears only in the f, f sector, must be
1
of the form f = f, f =  d d
 f and will not contribute in the 11

30

dimensional chern-simons form f f a. this is so because, if we work for simplicity in
12 dimensions (where the chern-simons form becomes f f f ), then f(4) contributes
only to a term of the type

1...8(ff1...4f5...8  32f1 f234f5...8)

(4.103)

which is zero if we partially integrate the d1 in f1, use the bianchi identity, and
then partially integrate back the resulting d.

the precise expression of the ansatz in the f sector is highly constrained. it
must reproduce the linearized term in (2.32), and it must yield the correct scalar
potential in d=7 after integrating over the compact space. in order to perform this
integral to which both the einstein action and the kinetic action of the 3-index photon
contribute we start with the d=4 scalar curvature associated with the conformal metric
g = 4/5g , namely 

r(4) = g r 

= 2yayb(t 3)ab + 2t yayb(t 2)ab + yaybt ab(t r(t 2)  t 2)

(yaybt ab)2

(4.104)

and its relation with the d=4 scalar curvature

r(4) = 4/5 r(4)  6g dd ln(2/5)  6g d ln(2/5)d ln(2/5)

(4.105)

using (4.48) to convert  into t ab, and adding the other contributions from the
einstein action, the integral over the compact space of the einstein action, when setting
the gauge elds to zero, and disregarding terms with d=7 space time derivatives yields

on the other hand, the integrated kinetic action of the 3 index photon has the form

(this becomes clear after diagonalizing t cd.) at this point, the integrated einstein
action contribution is of the desired form, namely a linear combination of t 2 and
t r(t 2): (31/70)t r(t 2) + (23/70)t 2.
  (yeyf t ef )2(1 + s)2, where 32qdet g (x)(1 + s) = f. (use that
f 2
(det g )(det g) = 2 and substitute (4.48).) the function s must be homogeneous
of degree zero in t , because in d=7 the potential is proportional to t 2  2tijt ij =

we used a symbolic manipulation program to obtain (4.104).

31

t 22tabt ab and the leading term (yeyf t ef )2 has already two ts. furthermore, s
a. in fact, the most general expression
depends only on the scalar uctuations in (1)i
s can have is

s = a(

y t 2y
(y t y )2  1) + b(

t
y t y  5)

(4.109)

because higher powers of t appearing in the ratios would yield terms proportional
to t r(t 1) in the 7-dimensional action. to be more explicit, lets consider a term
of the form y t 3y /(y t y )3. then, when integrating s 2, such a term also generates
a integral of the form r d4x(y t 3y )2/(y t y )4 which clearly will produce unwanted
t r(t 1)s (apply (4.108)). one requires then that the linearized limit of (4.97) yields
the results of [35], and that when adding the einstein action contribution we recover
upon integration the d=7 scalar potential. the last term in (4.97) has no linearized
contributions, while the coecient of the second term gets xed to 1/3 by requiring
agreement with [35]. hence, b = 1/3 while a is still a free parameter. however, a gets
also xed after evaluating the integral over s4 of the square of (1 + s) using (4.107),
(4.108) and (4.109) and requiring that after adding the einstein action contribution
one obtains (t 2  2t r(t 2))/4. thus, a has to satisfy a quadratic equation, namely
a(a + 2/3) = 0. it will turn out that the consistency of the gravitino transformation
law excludes the rst solution (a = 0), and requires the second (a = 2/3).
the result for f is rather surprising. initially, we made the ansatz

f = qgnu

d

 1


(1 + s) + gauge f ield dependent

terms

(4.110)

where 1 + s contains the ansatz for f in 4.97). this ansatz satises the bianchi
identity

4 d[ f]  f = 0

(4.111)
however, our original expression for s contained no term with (y  t  y )2 (it cor-
responded to the solution a = 0), and for this choice of s, the ansatz for f was
found to be truly nonlocal already in a perturbative expansion. with our present ansatz
(a = 2/3), the apparently nonlocal is, in fact, local and given by (4.98). it seems very
unlikely that the rst solution, containing the d = 11 nonlocal term d
d(1 + s)
would lead to the correct d = 7 action, since its presence require that we expand
1
d(1 + s) into an innite series of spherical harmonics, and though the factor 1
by

itself may not be fatal, being integrated over s4, the fact that innitely many spherical
harmonics would enter could lead to inconsistencies in the kk reduction.

1






the gauge eld dependence of the f is dictated by the 11-dimensional susy
laws. we begin with the f sector, and for simplicity, after substituting the 11-
dimensional susy variation in terms of our fermionic ansatze, we keep only the gravitino
terms. then, we get

(4.116)
(substitute into (4.29) that v m  cdycmyd, replace 2cd by cd  dc and
use (4.54) to eliminate c. one obtains then the commutator [ij, k]  jki  ikj.
the 1 from (4.54) cancels then one of the s in em
 ). the total susy variation 
could be pulled out in (4.115) because we are keeping only gravitino dependent terms,
and scalars vary into spin 1/2 elds.

i(i)ijc a


hence (4.115) allows us to read o the gauge eld dependence of f (see eq.
(4.98)). another nontrivial check of this ansatz is that when varying under susy the
scalars in the l.h.s. of (4.98) it reproduces the bab
 -dependent terms which we get
from the 11-dimensional susy variation of f.

the ansatz in the next sector, namely, f will be xed again by requiring the
consistency of susy laws. the complete answer is given in (4.99). the procedure to
determine the ansatz remains the same: vary under 11-dimensional susy laws f ,
look for simplicity only at gravitino dependent terms, and rewrite (after substituting
the various fermionic and vielbein ansatze) the 11-dimensional susy variation in terms
of a total 7-dimensional susy variation of 7-dimensional bosonic (gauge and scalar)
elds. so, varying the r.h.s. one gets

after acting with a [ on (4.121), the remaining terms can be cast into a total susy vari-

susy variation of f is the same as the 7-dimensional susy variation of the ansatz
given in (4.99).

to derive the ansatz of the next sector f is a bit more laborious. we follow

(4.123) and the 7 dimensional susy variation of a. note that the rst two terms

we conclude that, indeed, from the requirement that the susy laws are consistent

we obtain the ansatz for f given in (4.100).

at this moment, we can (again for simplicity of the argument) solve f from the

bianchi identities. the bianchi identities

[f] = 0

(4.129)

are trivially satised in the f sectors which we derived so far, because the gauge eld
dependent terms f can be easily cast into an exact form, while the purely scalar sectors
are components of a separately closed form. thus we use the last bianchi identity

f = 4[f]

(4.130)

which yields

f|b=0 = cs,ay a f|b=0 = 4c[s],ay a

(4.137)

and a corresponding relation for the auxiliary eld,
b = b,ay a

in order to reproduce the 7 dimensional sugra result (and have a consistent trunca-
tion of 11 dimensional sugra to the massless 7 dimensional elds), we must reproduce
the gauged sugra result for i
 , which does not have any ds terms, so we must

require kb =  52c

incidentally, we note that here if we would use the p=q=+1/2 solution in (4.16)
instead of p = q = 1/2 we would get (id+m) in (4.140) (because the commutation
relation of 1/2
past  gives a  sign). that means that at this moment the sign is
xed by requiring a consistent truncation.
in order to match this result with the s term in  in (4.6), we x c = i6.

we can then check this value of c by putting (4.137) in the 11d action for f. we
obtain the correct normalization for the 7d action of s,a.

5

at this moment, one can see why a rst order formulation for gravity instead of
the antisymmetric tensor eld does not work. consider the spin connection  as an
independent eld, as done in [38]; then the 11 dimensional gravitino transformation
law is the same, with d( ) replaced by d(), where



m n = 

m n (e, ) + bem en  + 

m n

(4.143)

38

 en

and [
m n em
] = 0. thus the b term we get in susy,11dim is at the
linearized level is 1
4b . but this has no 5 with respect to (4.139), and since
the susy law is xed by the denition of b, we cant introduce by hand the missing 5.
therfore it will be impossible to cancel the f terms in (4.136), as we did in (4.140). in
conclusion, we need a 4-index tensor to mix with the independent uctuation s.

now, let us analyze the nonlinear level. the nonlinear kk reduction gives for the

terms involving s

in the same way as it happened at the linear level, the s terms in b will
cancel the f terms, whereas the s terms in b and f add, and moreover

(neglecting massive elds which are put to zero)

we further work out the f term in  by substituting our ansatze for various

elds, where in f we consider only the independent uctuations term:

f|b=0 = cs,ay a

(4.147)

so, by substituting for f , using the ansatz for e

m in (4.28) and introducing

the identity as n

 

n =

we now see that the rst term is exactly what we want to have in 7 dimensional
supergravity (the s,a term of  in [39]), whereas the second term gets canceled

by the b term, if we choose the ansatz for b to be:

b = ct abs,bya

(4.152)
however, let us pause and comment on the ansatz for bm n p q. we know that bm n p q =
0 is a solution of the 11d equations of motion. so we can say that the ansatz for
the various components of bm n p q has to be such that the various components of
bm n p q = 0 correspond to various 7d equations of motion. then the rst remark
is that we have to add to (4.145) the necessary bilinears in fermions and gauge eld
strength to complete the 7-dimensional equation of motion for s,a (remember that
we always dropped in the susy transformation rules 3- and 4-fermi terms). using that
k = 5(62) (as it will be determined below (5.31)), the ansatz of the auxiliary eld
bm n p q is

be

= 243i[s],ay a + 3i
+ 9abcde f bc

t abs,bya

[ f de

] y a + 2  f ermi terms

(4.153)
the necessity of adding the gauge eld terms in the ansatz for the auxiliary eld bm n p q
can be seen if we try to derive the 7-dimensional action from the 11-dimensional one.
the ansatz for f is already bilinear in the gauge eld strength, and when integrating
out (f)2 on s4 we get as a result terms with (f ab
 )4 which are not present in the
d = 7 action. however, they are precisely canceled by the gauge eld strengths which
enter in the ansatz of bm n p q, after integrating out (bm n p q)2. the second observation
is that no other bosonic equation of motion can appear in bm n p q, since all other
bosonic equations have 2 derivatives, and so we would get terms with 4 derivatives
in the 7d action. after nding the correct ansatz for b, we can easily nd the
nonlinear terms in i:

we next substitute for f and b. then we write e
(4.96). using (3.21) for the contraction of cs which we get, and the identity

n in terms of scalars via

(1)i

yct r(u1iu d)c d

(4.36), and substituting the 7 dimensional transformation law of i

now we work on the last term (the last two lines). for that, we need a few identities:
by multiplying the fierzing relation (3.42) with ya(a)jk we deduce that

5i = ya(a)i

j j

41

(4.162)

if we multiply the same relation (3.42) with 5(a)jk, we get

from which we also derive, by multiplying with c n

p + y ai = yb(ab)i
a, that

(4.163)

(4.164)

(4.165)

using (4.164) and (4.165) we prove that the last term in (4.161) is zero, so that we

are left with the correct 11 dimensional result.

4.3 the gravitino and s,a transformation laws

, the gauge eld bab

let us recapitulate what we have done so far. we have checked that using our ansatze
for the 11 dimensional elds we reproduce the 7 dimensional transformation laws for
i, and the terms involving s in
the graviton ea
the transformation laws of the gravitini i
 and fermions ii . we have also checked the
gauge eld dependence of f by matching terms in (11d)
susy f with the variation
of all the elds in the ansatz for f. the analysis of the independent uctuation
s,a was implicitely done when we studied the f sector. however, for complete-
ness of our work we give a separate check on s susy transformation law.

 , the scalars a

we begin by considering the case when bab

 = 0 in the s,a transformation law

and we nd s,a from

i
6

f|b=0 = s,a|b=0y a

(4.166)

because the bab
be multiplied by bcd
in (2.14) and the fact that





terms in f appear at least quadratically, (so bab

 will always
, which we put to zero). using the transformation law for a

we get

|b=0 = 1/10(1/2

we split this contribution into 3 terms, corresponding to the terms in the 7 dimensional

transformation law, one with  acting on i and ii, one with  acting on a

to evaluate the contribution with the the gravitino , we make use of the equations

combination which appears on the l.h.s. of (4.54) (because yaa  5). substituting

this was the last term to be checked in the transformation law of the 3 index tensor

set to zero, which therefore is in complete agreement with the
11 dimensional transformation laws.



now, we let the gauge elds to take non-zero values. since the dependence on the
gravitini and gauge elds was already checked (see the analysis performed for the susy
law in the f sector), we will only check the f terms in the s 7-dimensional
susy law. hence we keep from the 11-dimensional susy variation of s only the terms
with potential contribution to the spin 1/2 and f ab
 dependent terms in the d=7 susy
law:

in fact, a gauge covariant d derivative. (that this is the case, we already know from

which we can prove by using (3.42), we get the same result as in (4.197), but with
the opposite sign, as we should. so all the extra contributions cancel and we are left
with the 7 dimensional result (4.193). note that at this moment if we chose the a=0
solution for (4.109), it will not work. so, as promised, the ansatz for the scalar eld
dependence of f is xed by the consistency of the gravitino transformation law.

this last problem turns out to be surprisingly complicated. we have only partial
results; they seem to involve the explicit expression of the matrix u and we prefer to
devote a separate paper to this issue. the same holds for the scalar dependent terms
in the susy law of the 7 dimensional spin 1/2 elds.

5 bosonic equations of motion and action

in this section we will do some further checks on our ansatze by looking at the bosonic
action and equations of motion, and reproducing some of the corresponding equations
of motion and terms in the action in seven dimensions.

(5.10)

and from (5.10), together with (5.7) we also get that

 abs,[as,b] = 0

(5.11)

now we want to see that we reproduce these equations from the 11 dimensional equa-
tions of motion. first, we notice that (5.3) was already discussed. the only nontrivial
component is the {}, which is just the equation of motion of the antisymmetric
tensor, s,a. lets look now at (5.2), setting the gauge eld to zero.
substituting the ansatze for f and g the {} component of (5.2) becomes

y(ayb)tcbh2(t ac  2tac) + (t 1(t t 1))ac + 2s,as,ci

we notice that the rst line is the scalar equation of motion (5.6), the second line is
the antisymmetric tensor equation of motion in (5.8)and the third is (5.11) which is a
combination of the scalar and gauge eld equations of motion.

similarly, by substituting the ansatze for f and g, the {} component of

(5.2) becomes

[y a]y b[(t 1t )ba +

(5.8). the {} component of (5.2) gives

in the rst line, the second bracket is zero upon using the equation of motion for the 7d
antisymmetric tensor, (5.8), to convert both s,bs into 1s234,ct 1
bc , whereas
the second line gives directly the antisymmetric tensor equation.

the einsteins equations (5.1) are considerably more involved. we have computed
all the terms for zero gauge eld, but the task of reconstructing the seven dimensional
eld equations is quite laborious, and we have not completed it, but we can see that we
get nontrivial combinations of these seven dimensional eld equations. the fact that
already from the antisymmetric eld equation (5.2) we get all the seven dimensional
eld equations (except einsteins equation) is already quite nontrivial. moreover, the
eleven dimensional einsteins equation for  =  contains the seven dimensional
einsteins equation, (5.9), together with many more terms. so we can say that the
seven dimensional bosonic equations of motion solve the eleven dimensional equations
of motion in all the sectors we have checked. we leave the complete check of the
einsteins equations to the diligent reader.

lets now turn to the bosonic action in (5.4). part of the action was already
calculated. we have also reproduced the scalar eld potential, and this was how we
i. the condition that the einstein
xed the dependence of f on the scalars a
action in 11 dimensions gives us the einstein action in 7 dimensions gave us the ansatz
for the 11 dimensional vielbein component ea
incidentally, we note also that we

found the kinetic terms for the gravitini i
i (without the
q-connection piece). by requiring that we reproduce them we have xed the ansatz for
the components of the 11 dimensional gravitino. so we need to reproduce the scalar
eld and gauge eld kinetic terms,  1
 )2, and also the s,a
terms. the s,a terms give us the mechanism for self-duality in odd dimensions at
the level of the action (we have deduced this mechanism from the susy laws).

we will look only at the rst two terms, the last two being inferred as being the gauge

ance, so this will be a nontrivial check on the algebra). the contributions to this term
come from the 11 dimensional einstein action and the maxwell term, 1/48f 2

two derivatives on scalars, so it should cancel with similar terms coming from the 11

as it should. this nishes the analysis of the bosonic action.

in the last part of this section we will make some comments on other ansatze for
bosonic elds which appeared in the literature. most notably, we will try to see the
relation with the truncation considered in [26] to the bosonic sector of n=1 gauged
supergravity with gauge group su(2). a series of papers [10, 11, 27] also looked at
other bosonic truncations of 11d sugra to 7 dimensions with abelian gauge groups.
consistent truncations to other dimensions were considered in [29, 28, 30, 31].

52

the su(2) truncation has the metric, one scalar x, an su(2) gauge eld ai

(1) and

a 3-form eld a(3). the reduction ansatz in [26], written in form language, is

and the metric and eld strength in form language are given in (4.93) and (4.133), re-
spectively. a comparison of the seven dimensional part of the metric tells us that  =
6/5 and suggests the ansatz for embedding x into tab: tab = diag{x, x, x, x, x4},
and breaking the so(5) invariance by writing the 4-sphere in terms of 3-spheres as

53

y a = {cos y , sin}, with y  2 = 1. indeed, then we reproduce the form of , and
if we also choose b 5 = 0, we get

(5.40)

and we also reproduce the ansatz for the 11 dimensional antisymmetric tensor at zero
gauge eld. the gauge eld dependence looks somewhat dierent, however. (we still
have to nd an embedding for ai
 by putting 3 other gauge elds to zero,
but that will not help) but this is easy to trace: we see that in our formula (5.40),
 is multiplied by a y , whereas in the su(2) truncation in (5.35)
the gauge eld b 
we have no dependence on the compact coordinates. this is due to the known fact
that for a kk reduction on a group manifold (su(2) in this case) we can write the
ansatz for the o-diagonal vielbein without a killing vector (b
i , instead of
b
ab). the same type of dierence appears in the antisymmetric tensor
equation. for example we can see that the terms with no gauge eld and the terms
with one gauge eld and no derivatives on the scalars are:

(5.42)

we then notice that indeed the only dierence between our result and the ansatz in
[26] is the same one as the dierence in the metric ansatz.

the obvious question is whether under this conditions we can still reproduce the
it turns out that we can, as we can easily
action in (5.38) from our action (5.39).
check. isnt that a contradiction then? no, because the truncation of the n=4 (so(5))
gauged sugra to the n=1 (su(2)) sugra is not consistent. indeed, the scalar (tab)
equation of motion of (5.39) is

if we substitute the ansatz for tab and bab

 we get an o-diagonal piece (a 6= b)

(ba

 ) = 0

(5.44)

54

which is easy to see that will not be equal to zero, nor to the equation of motion of
the su(2) gauge eld, whatever the embedding of a(1)
 . so we conclude that
we have the somewhat puzzling situation that there are two possible embeddings of
the su(2) model in 11 dimensions, both of them giving the right action, a direct one
found in [26], which is consistent, and an indirect one (via the n=4 model) which is
inconsistent.

 into b 

i

we see that the inconsistency is due to the gauge eld, so if we put it to zero we
have the same ansatz as [26]. also, if we keep all the diagonal scalar elds but no gauge
eld, as in [27], we reproduce their ansatz.

6 discussion and conclusions

in this paper we discuss the consistency of the kk reduction of the original formulation
of 11d sugra [1] on ads7  s4 [35] using the nonlinear ansatz presented in a previous
letter [12] for the embedding of d=7 elds in d=11. our ansatz for the metric factorizes
into a rescaled 7 dimensional metric and a gauge invariant two form which depends

on the fundamental composite tensors t ab = 1
elements for the scalar elds.

the scale factor satises 6/5 = y  t  y . we note that the full internal metric g =

ab y b has the geometrical meaning of a metric on an ellipsoid multiplied
by a conformal factor, namely g = 4/5z aza where z a is constrained to lie on
an ellipsoid. therefore the overall eect of all scalar uctuations on the internal metric
is to deform the background sphere into a conformally rescaled ellipsoid.

s,b is real. it is again gauge invariant but diers from the
geometric proposal of freed, harvey, minasian and moore [45] by the dependence on
t. setting t=i we recover their result but our expression follows from consistency of
the kk program and still satises df(4) = 0. to prove df(4) = 0, one may use the
schouten identity [a1...a5yb] = 0. this xes all relative coecients in f(4). because

55

in this process we can at most convert one factor t  y /(y  t  y ) into a y , there do
not seem possible deformations with two factors t  y /(y  t  y ).
a conrmation of our ansatz for f (4) is obtained by evaluating the term f f a in
the 11 dimensional action. we begin with f f f in d=12. the terms without bare
bs contain f(2), y, y and ts. using (3.41) in reverse order and the orthogonality
relations in (4.108), integration over s4 produces 2t rf 4  (t rf 2)2, which is indeed
the exterior derivative in the d=7 chern simons term. the b terms should not aect
this result because both f (4) and the nal result are gauge invariant.

the 4-index antisymmetric auxiliary eld b has only a 7-dimensional part,

s(7)

(6.4)

on d=7 shell, b should vanish and since it should contain at most one derivative
to exclude higher derivative terms in the d=7 action, it can only be proportional to the
eld equation of s,a. since it should mix with a to produce selfduality in odd
dimensions, it should have the same spherical harmonic as a, and this explains the
factor y a in (6.4) and rules out an alternative (t  y )a/(y  t  y ).
our ansatz for the fermions (4.14-4.16) is the standard one except for the following
aspects:

to the so(5)g indices of the killing spinors.

(i) there are u matrices connecting the so(5)c spinor indices of the d=7 fermions
(ii) factors of 5. they are xed by requiring that (y, x) varies only into the

killing spinor ((d = 11)(y, x) = (d = 7)i (y)u i

i (y, x)i (x)).

the consistency of the truncation is proven by obtaining the correct d=7 susy
transformation laws from d=11 ones. we checked all transformation rules except: (i)
the variation with more than one fermion eld and (ii) some terms in the variation
of the fermions which depend only on scalars. no authors have ever determined the
higher order fermionic terms, but we would like to come back to them in the future.
presumably, they x the remaining freedom in u . as to the scalar terms in  and
, many consistency checks are satised, but this is a complicated problem which
deserves a separate study. also here we expect that the remaining freedom in u will
get xed.

we have followed de wit and nicolai [2, 3] by introducing a matrix u (y, x) which
connects the d=7 fermions to the killing spinors in the ansatz for the gravitino. this

matrix must satisfy equation (4.54), u y/ = v/u with vi = 1
i for the scalars come
the susy transformation laws bab
out correctly. we have found general solutions to this equation, but for most of our
results, the explicit form of u is not needed.

for the gauge elds and a



i

the ansatz for the antisymmetric tensor eld strength f was determined in 3
steps: rst, the dependence on the gauge elds was uniquely xed by requiring that the
11 dimensional susy variation of f matches the 7 dimensional susy variation of our
ansatz for f. next, the ansatz for the embedding of the independent d = 7 uctu-
ation s,a was derived together with the ansatz for the d = 11 auxiliary eld bm n p q.

actually, in their work, the matrix u interpolates between spinor indices, whereas in our approach u

connects the so(5)g indices i of the killing spinors with the so(5)c indices i  of the d = 7 fermions.

finally, the dependence of f on the d = 7 scalar elds was xed by requiring that
one obtains the correct scalar eld potential in d=7 and the correct dependence of the
d=7 sugra transformation rules on the tensor tij = (1)i
i
is the group vielbein for the scalars.

for completeness of our results, we have derived the 7 dimensional bosonic action
and bosonic equations of motion at zero gauge eld from the corresponding objects
in 11 dimensions. since in the bosonic sector all criteria for consistency are satised
(the consistency of the transformation rules, equations of motion and even the action
agrees) we infer that our results also prove the consistency of the bosonic truncation.
we have shown the relation to other ansatze found in the literature for consistent
truncation to subsets of bosonic elds.

we have also explained the origin of self-duality in odd dimensions. one has to use
a rst order action for f in d=11 to obtain a self-dual action for s,a in d=7
which is linear in derivatives. the d = 7 uctuation s,a not only appears in the
d = 11 curvatures f and f, but also in the d = 11 auxiliary eld b in (6.4),
namely in the form b  s + ds, and substituting the ansatz for b and f (s) into
d = 11 action, we recovered the selfdual action in d = 7. we believe that in all cases,
self-dual actions can be obtained from kk reduction of a rst order formalism for the
corresponding eld.

stages of this work and b. de wit for a useful discussion on his work.

a.1 conventions and gamma matrix algebra

we denote in 7 dimensional minkowski space the coordinates by y, at vector indices
by a,b,c... and curved vector indices by , , ... similarly, we denote in 4 dimensional
euclidean space the coordinates by x, at indices by m, n, p, and curved vector indices
by , ... eleven dimensional vector indices are denoted by m, n, p for at indices and
, , ... for curved indices. the so(5)  u sp(4) gauge group is denoted by so(5)g
and a, b... = 1, 5 are so(5)g vector indices and i, j... = 1, 4 are u sp(4) indices (or
so(5)g spinor indices). the scalars form a coset sl(5, r)/so(5) and to avoid confusion
we denote the composite subgroup by so(5)c, with vector indices i, j... and spinor
indices i, j, ...=1,4.

the d=11 metric g has signature mostly plus, ( + ...+). the cliord algebra

we introduce dirac matrices in d=7 and d=4.

normalize the  symbols as 0...10 = 0...7 = 1...4 = +1, so that in d=7

because these tensors are usp(4) invariant tensors with denite symmetry properties.
hence they should be constructed from the symplectic metric cij .we choose a gamma
matrix representation such that cij = ij .
(this matrix cij is thus the charge
conjugation matrix c (5) = c (5)

+ in 5 dimensions, see below. it equals c (4)
 ).

we lower usp(4) indices with ij as follows

i = j ji

(a.14)

and raise them with ij as

i = ij j
(a.15)
where ij is dened by ij ik = j
k . of course,  is 1 and can be obtained
from ij by raising indices with ij . the result is ij = ij . we have found it
convenient to use a dierent symbol for ij , namely ij .

a.2 charge conjugation matrices and modied majorana
spinors

in even dimensions there are two charge conjugation matrices, c(+) and c(), satis-
fying c()c1
) = ,t . in odd dimensions there is only one charge conjugation
(
matrix, either c(+) or c(). they are either symmetric or antisymmetric, and all their
properties are independent of the representation chosen. for a general discussion of
majorana and modied majorana spinors in minkowski or euclidian space and charge
conjugation matrices, see [46].

in 11 minkowski dimensions, there is only one c matrix. it satises

hence c (11) = c (11)

c (11)m c (11)1 = t
() . furthermore, c (11),t = c (11).

m

in 7 minkowski dimensions, c (7) = c (7)

(), but is symmetric
a , c (7),t = c (7)

c (7)ac (7)1 =  t

(a.16)

(a.17)

in d=4 both a c (4)
(+) and a c (4)
where c (4) = c (4)
().

() exist. both are antisymmetric, but c (11) = c (7)  c (4),

then c is symmetric and c5 antisymmetric (since c t = c). it also follows
that for the 5-dimensional gamma matrices, ca in (a.12) are antisymmetric and the
matrices c[ab] in (a.13) are symmetric. this means that (ca)[ij] and (c[ab])(ij)
give the isomorphisms between the 5, respectively the 10 representations of so(5) and
usp(4) (so(5)usp(4)).

the majorana condition in 11 dimensions is

in 7 minkowski dimensions we can only dene a modied majorana condition,

t c (11) = i0

(i )t c (7) ji = i(j ) 0  j

59

(a.18)

(a.19)

to determine which majorana condition we need in d=4 euclidean space, we decom-
pose the anticommuting 11 dimensional majorana spinors  into 4 anticommuting 7-
dimensional modied majorana spinors times corresponding commuting 4-dimensional
spinors i . the spinors  must satisfy the following modied majorana condition

(k )t c (4)

()kj = (j )5

(a.20)

 in the text, we always dene i  (i )t c (4)

satisfy
