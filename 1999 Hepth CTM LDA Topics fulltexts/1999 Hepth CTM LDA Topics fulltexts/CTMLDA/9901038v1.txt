abstract

superelds in 2-dimensional (2,2)-superspacetime which are indepen-
dent of (some) half of the fermionic coordinates are discussed in a hope-
fully both comprehensive and comprehensible manner. an embarrassing
abundance of these simplest building blocks makes it utterly impossi-
ble to write down the most general lagrangian. with some ad hoc
but perhaps plausible restrictions, a rather general lagrangian is found,
which exhibits many of the phenomena that have been studied recently,
and harbors many more. in particular, it becomes patently obvious that
the (2,2)-supersymmetric 2-dimensional eld theory target space geome-
tries (many of which are suitable for (super)string propagation) are far
more general than kahler manifolds with holomorphic bundles.

1. introduction

superelds are used extensively in 2-dimensional supersymmetric eld theories. alas! the
diversity of conventions obscures the straightforward. in particular, these building blocks
are frequently obtained by dimensional reduction from the 4-dimensional case, which (by
far) does not provide for full generality [1]: contrary to some claims in the literature (even
in book form!) in 2-dimensional spacetimes, (2,2)- (a.k.a. n =2) supersymmetry does not
imply kahlerness of the eld space!

an intrinsically 2-dimensional analysis, from scratch, is presented here, and provides

generalizations to the results in the recent literature; see, e.g., refs. [2,3,4].

this article is organized as follows: the remaining part of this introductory section
presents some basic facts about 2-dimensional (2,2)-superspace and sets up the notation;
further details are found in appendix a. section 2 presents a rather rich set of constrained
superelds in a systematic way, and provides several directions for generalizations. the
most general lagrangian for the superelds of  2 (subject to a few hopefully plausible
restrictions) is given in section 3, using implicitly constrained superelds, with the de-
tails of component eld expansions deferred to the appendix b. an alternate, explicitly
constrained formalism is discussed in section 4. section 5 then turns to some relations to
geometry, in particular that of the target (eld) space. section 6 summarizes the presented
results and discusses some further topics.

1.1. 2-dimensional spacetime

the crucial peculiarity of supersymmetric models in 2-dimensional spacetime stems from
the fact that the lorentz group, so(1, 1), is abelian and so has only 1-dimensional irre-
ducible representations: for example, the coordinate 2-vector (0, 1) decomposes into the
(light-cone) characteristic coordinates def= 1
2 (01). these, in fact, are eignefunctions
of the (lorentz boost) generator 1), b

def= (10+01), of so(1, 1):

b  = j3()  =  

(1.1)
def= eib, acts diagonally: u  = ei. for brevity,
so that the group element, u
we also write =| def= ++ and =def= . note that upon the analytic continuation 0  i0,
(=| , =)  (z, z): the light-cone structure becomes a complex structure. similar argu-
ments show that all other tensors (spinors) decompose into 1-component objects. upon
the analytic continuation to imaginary time, 0  i0, u becomes the winding number
(holomorphic homogeneity) operator. the sub- and superscripts  then simply denote
the winding number (spin in real time) in units of 1
2 (h). functions depending on only
=| or only = are called left- and right-movers, respectively, and become holomorphic
(complex-analytic) and anti-holomorphic (complex-antianalytic) functions upon analytic
continuation to imaginary time.

1) the eigenvalue of the lorentz boost operator, b

= (10+01), extended to total angular
momentum in the usual way, equals the spin projection, and will therefore be denoted by j3
although it does not stem from its 4-dimensional namesake. moreover, since all representations of
the 2-dimensional lorentz group are 1-dimensional, there is no need to distinguish between spin
and spin projection, whence we will call j3 simply spin.

1.2. (2,2)-superbasics

the (2,2)-supersymmetry algebra involves the supersymmetry charges q and q, which
satisfy (adapting from refs. [5,2]; comparison with refs. [6,4] is provided in appendix a):

(cid:8) q , q(cid:9) = 2i = 2(h  p) .

def= 

=| =(0+1) and =

def= 
2 (=| =) is
here ++=|
the linear momentum operator and h=  i0=  i
2 (=| +=) is the hamiltonian (energy)
operator. note that p has the usual sign as in quantum mechanics, while h has the
opposite sign; with these conventions, (e, e) is a light-like 2-vector.

= =(01). p=  i1=  i

equipping the world-sheet with anticommuting fermionic coordinates, , , the su-

percharges are realized as dierential operators on the (super) world-sheet 2):

q

def=  + i ,

q

def=    i .

(1.3)

supersymmetry transformations are generated by the q, qs, and implemented (eected)
by unitary operator

u,

def= exp(cid:8)i(q + q)(cid:9) .

which, in fact, is a quartic multinomial in the q, qs, by virtue of their nilpotency. the
spinorial derivatives

d

def=   i ,

d

def=   + i ,

(1.5)

are covariant with respect to u,. easily, {q, d} = 0 = {q, d}, whereupon
[u,, d] = 0 = [u,, d].

finally the d, ds close virtually the same algebra (1.2), as do the q, qs:

(1.2)

(1.4)

(1.6)

(1.7)

(cid:8) d , d(cid:9) = 2i = 2(h  p) .

all anticommutators among the q, q, d, d, other than (1.2) and (1.6), vanish.

the berezin superintegrals (over supercoordinates) are by denition equivalent to
partial superderivatives, and up to total (world-sheet) spacetime derivatives 3) (which we
ignore, assuming world-sheets without boundaries) equivalent to covariant superderiva-
tives [5,6]. we use:

z d4 [. . .] def= 1

4 [d, d][d+, d+][. . .](cid:12)(cid:12)  d4[. . .] ,

where | means setting  = 0 = . integration over a fermionic subspace is formally
achieved by inserting a fermionic dirac delta-function, so that:

z d2 [. . .]  1

2(cid:2)d, d+(cid:3)[. . .](cid:12)(cid:12) ,

z d2  [. . .]  1

2(cid:2)d+, d(cid:3)[. . .](cid:12)(cid:12) ;

2) since () = , for (q) = q, it must be that ( ) =   and () =  .
3) hereafter, total derivative will stand for total (world-sheet) spacetime derivative.

(1.8a, b)

z d2/ [. . .]  1
z d2 =| [. . .]  1

2(cid:2)d, d+(cid:3)[. . .](cid:12)(cid:12) ,

2(cid:2)d+, d+(cid:3)[. . .](cid:12)(cid:12) .

(1.8c, d)

(1.8e, f)

clearly, the denitions (1.8c, d) may also be obtained from (1.8a, b) by swapping  +   +;
see below. similarly, the denitions (1.8e, f) follow from (1.8c, d) upon  +  . as
expected then, for example,

z d4 [. . .] = z d2z d2  [. . .] , = z d2/z d2\ [. . .] .

(1.9)

note negative sign in the second identity, and that the integral measures in (1.8e, f) are
not (pseudo)scalars; they have spin 1. also, a few operatorial identities collected in
appendix a will be useful.

1.3. superspace symmetries

in more than 2-dimensional spacetimes, lorentz transformations leave the integrals (1.8)
unchanged. however, they rotate eqs. (1.8c)(1.8d) and (1.8e)(1.8f).

it is of interest then to examine the discrete symmetries acting on the four-fermionic
coordinate system, or alternatively, the four covariant superdierentials, d, d, d+, d+.
since the lorentz transformations act diagonally on the d, ds, they can be treated as
independent objects in a lorentz-invariant fashion. thus, the maximal discrete group
acting on the d, d system by swapping them is s4, the group of permutations of four
distinguishable objects. the simplest are, of course, the swaps:

c+ : d+d+ ,
p : d+d ,
q : dd+ ,

c : dd ,
p : d+d ,
q : dd+ .

(1.10a, b)

(1.10c, d)

(1.10e, f)

where each of these operations only swaps the indicated superderivatives and leaves the
other two intact. also, it should be clear that [ c+, c]=0, [p, p]=0 and [q, q]=0. fur-
thermore, e.g., p cp = cp c = , and p c+p = c+p c+ = q.

there are additional discrete transformations involving time-reversal, t , which acts
by t (=| ) = = and t (=) = =| . since time-reversal squares to the identify, t 2 = 1l,
it will double the group of discrete transformations of the d, d system, and we call
this group 2s4.

notice that the familiar (ambidexterous) complex conjugation, c, may be expressed
as c= c c+. this operation exchanges the integrals (1.8a)(1.8b) and (1.8c)(1.8d),
but leaves (1.8e) and (1.8f ) intact.

similarly, the full, parity (spatial reection), p , may be expressed as p =pp, and it is
easy to show that [c, p ]=0, as should be the case. p exchanges the integrals (1.8c)(1.8d)
and (1.8e)(1.8f), but leaves (1.8a) and (1.8b) intact.

 3 

also, the combined parity and complex conjugation, cp = qq, exchanges the inte-

grals (1.8a)(1.8b) and (1.8e)(1.8f), but leaves those in (1.8c) and (1.8d) intact.
it is very important to realize that the operators (1.10) are dened there to act on the
soul of the (2, 2)-super-riemann superface, i.e., the fermionic coordinates and so the su-
perderivatives acting on them. however, the relation between the superderivatives and the
world-sheet derivatives (1.6) induces an action on the body too, i.e., on the world-sheet
coordinates. in the often used euclidean incarnation, (=| , =)  (z, z), what was called
parity (the unidexterous p and p, and the ambidexterous p ) becomes (another!) com-
plex conjugation. while the induced action of c and c on the world-sheet coordinates
(=| , =) is trivial (since the supersymmetry relations (1.6) are hermitian), the induced
action of p, p and p is not! these do become the (unidexterous and ambidexterous,
respectively) complex conjugations when acting on the euclideanized body, i.e., bosonic
world-sheet coordinates, but remain parity (spin-ip) in the soul, i.e., the fermionic coor-
dinates. foremost, they are independent from the c and c. the unaware reader should
be cautioned that the careful distinction between these operations is sometimes muddled
in the literature.

finally, the lorentz boost group element (generalized, as usual, to include spin) u =
eib satises uu = u(+) so [u, u] = 0. also, [u, c] = 0, but up = p u1
.
thus, the usual super-poincare group is extended by the various discrete symmetries (1.10)
and time-reversal, t , so that the discrete subroup is 2s4.

the discrete symmetry, s4, generated by the swaps (1.10), is part of the continuous
gl(4, c), the gl(2, c)gl+(2, c) supgroup of which then commutes with the lorentz
symmetry. i defer the study of such continuous transformations to a later opportunity.

2. haploid superelds

general superelds are (super)functions of (0, 1; , ). akin to complex-analytic (holo-
morphic) functions depending only on the complex-analytic half of complex variables, we
dene haploid superelds to depend only on (some) half of the four fermionic coordinates
, . models that involve such super-holomorphic superelds exhibit a much better
quantum behavior, not unrelated to the special features of complex-analytic functions [5,6].

2.1. first-order constrained haploid superelds

as the lorentz transformations in 1+1-dimensional spacetime leave the four ,  inde-

pendent of each other, there exist six distinct types of hapliod superelds (as(cid:0)4

of which are annihilated by (some) half of the superderivatives:

2(cid:1) = 6), all

(2.1a)

(2.1b)

(2.1c)

(2.1d)

(2.1e)

(2.1f)

1. chiral :

2. antichiral :

3. twisted-chiral :

4. twisted-antichiral :

5. lefton :

6. righton :

d+ = 0 = d ,
d+ = 0 = d ,
d+ = 0 = d ,
d+ = 0 = d ,
d = 0 = d ,
d+ = 0 = d+ .

 4 

the rst four pairs of superconstraints simply restrict , , ,  to be independent of two
of the fermionic coordinates , , up to total derivatives.

by contrast, of the last two superconstraint pairs, each one includes also a spacetime

derivative constraint (see below):

(2.2)

eqs. (2.1e)  (cid:8)= = 0(cid:9) ,

eqs. (2.1f)  (cid:8)=|  = 0(cid:9) .

as a result, the component elds in the lefton supereld  are functions of only =| (holo-
morphic, i.e., left-movers), whereas those in the righton supereld  are functions of
only = (anti-holomorphic, i.e., right-movers). we return to this below, after dening
the component elds.

we will also encounter an even more restricted type of superelds, which depend only

on one out of the four , s, and so are annihilated by three superderivatives:

1. chiral lefton :

2. antichiral lefton :

3. chiral righton :

4. antichiral righton :

d+l = dl = dl = 0 ,
d+l = dl = dl = 0 ,
dr = d+r = d+r = 0 ,
dr = d+r = d+r = 0 .

(2.3a)

(2.3b)

(2.3c)

(2.3d)

depending only on some quarter of the supercoordinates , , we call them quartoid super-
elds. clearly, they may be considered as special cases of the haploid ones (2.1): e.g., l
may be regarded as a d-annihilated chiral supereld, a d-annihilated twisted antichiral
supereld, or a d+-annihilated (i.e., chiral) lefton. we adopted this last nomenclature in
virtue of its simplicity and the fact that it also alludes to the implicit spacetime constraints
=l = 0 = =l and =| r = 0 = =| r. the reader may prefer the obvious twisted
analogues: l = l, r = r , l = l and r = r.

a disclaimer is in order: our purpose thus far was merely to list the logical possiblities.
the quantum theory of the unidexterous elds dened in eqs. (2.1e, f) and (2.3ad) may
indeed seem curiously cumbersome, owing to the ocurrence of the spacetime constraints as
exemplied in eqs. (2.2). for unidexterous spin-0 elds (chiral bosons) and their (1,0)-
and (1,1)-supersymmetrizations see refs. [7,8]; ref. [9] oers some welcome clarications
about the dynamics and symmetries involved and an updated reference list on the topic.
we merely remark that the constraints may be regarded as generators of a gauge symmetry,
with the transformations:

= = 0   = =(=) ,
=|  = 0   = =| (=| ) .

(2.4)

this gauge invariance then ensures the proper decoupling of the unwanted degrees of free-
dom. thus, a well-dened quantum eld theory model involving unidexterous (super)elds
must be invariant with respect to the chiral gauge symmetry (2.4).

seeking generality, our approach will then be as follows: at rst, we ignore the unidex-
terous quantization issues. we then return to these issues in a simple setting and discuss
some of the implications. relying on the general and powerful machineries such as the
operatorial quantization (see ref. [10] and the references therein), we defer the (careful
tedium of ausarbeitung of the) covariantization of (a suitable subset of) the present results
with respect to (2.4) and a full treatment of the (super)constraint eects to a later eort.

 5 

2.2. supereld symmetries

in more than 2-dimensional spacetimes, lorentz transformations leave the pair of super-
constraint superderivatives (2.1a, b) (and so also , ) unchanged. however, they mix
those in eqs. (2.1c)(2.1d) and (2.1e)(2.1f). so, for example, requiring a supereld to
satisfy eq. (2.1c) implies, upon a suitable lorents transformation, that the same supereld
must also satisfy (2.1d), whereupon it follows that it must be a constant. the same applies
to the eqs. (2.1e, f ). only chiral superelds and their conjugates remain viable haploid su-
perelds when spacetime has more than two dimensions. conversely, , , ,  cannot be
obtained by dimensional reduction; their existence is exceptional to (2,2)-supersymmetric
()2-dimensional spacetime.

now, complex conjugation 4), c, leaves the superconstraints (2.1e, f) invariant, while
exchanging (2.1a)(2.1b) and (2.1c)(2.1d), and so  and . thus, ,  and
,  are complex conjugate pairs, while  and  remain unrelated. so, while in general
complex, the unidexterous superelds  and  may be chosen to be real or imaginary. note
that the left-handed conjugation, c+, exchanges  and , while the right-handed
conjugation, c exchanges  and , and both leave ,  intact.
on the other hand, parity, p , reects spin (+). therefore,

it exchanges
eqs. (2.1c)(2.1d) and (2.1e)(2.1f), and so  and , but leaves eqs. (2.1a, b)
unchanged. that is, ,  and ,  are paired by the left-right parity, p , while  and 
remain unrelated. note that the unconjugate parity, p, exchanges  and , while
the conjugate parity, p exchenges  and , and both leave ,  intact.

however, since c commutes with p , in c-invariant models  and  must trans-
form identically under the action of p and any other symmetry that commutes with
c. similarly, in left-right-symmetric (parity-invariant) models,  and  must transform
identically under the action of c and any other symmetry that commutes with p .

besides the s4 group of discrete symmetries (1.10) and time-reversal t , there may also
exist discrete or continuous transformations operating entirely in the (super)eld space.
the fact that the unidexterous superelds (2.1e, f) and (2.3) obey a world-sheet spacetime
constraint sets them apart form the others (2.1ad), and there can be no transformation
in the supereld space which would mix the ambidexterous superelds (2.1ad) and the
unidexterous ones (2.1e, f) and (2.3). this also means that we cannot require of models
to be p,- p,- q,- or q-invariant. further symmetry considerations (and especially gauging)
are beyond the scope of this paper, but we note that c-invariance ensures that (, ),
(, ), (l, l ) and (r, r) all come in (conjugate) pairs. it is c+- (or c-) invariance
that would also require that the (anti)chiral and twisted (anti)chiral superelds are paired.
no such restriction ensues for the unidexterous superelds , .

4) in 2-dimensional spacetime, hermitian conjugation is complex conjugation and transposition

(including derivative action to the left), without parity or time-reversal.

 6 

2.3. component elds

the fermionic coordinates ,  being anticommutative, they are also nilpotent, and so
only non-negative powers make sense. moreover, all taylor series over ,  must termi-
nate with the   + + term. thus, superelds are always analytic, in fact, multinomials
of nite (up to quartic) order over , .

supereld components

the component elds are dened as the super-taylor expansion coecients

are the component elds of the chiral and antichiral spin-0 supereld. note that both
f, f change sign with respect to the parity, p ; that is, f, f are pseudo-scalars if the
lowest components, , , are scalars. complex conjugation on all components of a chiral
supereld may (and herein will) be carried only by the index. that is, we write   ,
   
, f  f . component eld content is also specied by  = (; ; f ) and
 = ( ; ; f ), leaving the numerical tedium of 2 factors and such up to the readers
preference.

are the component elds of a twisted chiral and a twisted antichiral spin-0 supereld.
the elds x, x change sign (are pseudoscalar) with respect to the combined parity and
complex conjugation, cp , if x, x are scalars with respect to it. complex conjugation on
the components of a twisted chiral supereld may again be carried only by the index,
at the expense of labeling the - and the  +-components by dierent characters 5), as
was done in (2.5c, d). appending indices is then straightforward: x  x ,

are the component elds in the lefton and righton superelds. note that both l=| , r=
change sign under complex conjugation if , r do not: l=| , r= are imaginary if , r are real.
in general, however, these superelds and their components are complex. components of
the conjugate superelds are dened as hermitian conjugates of (2.5e, f), and so

a remark is perhaps in order. the astute reader must have wondered about the
seemingly unequal denitions of l=| , r= in (2.5e, f), as compared to those of f, f , x, x
in eqs. (2.5a, b, c, d). since, e.g, [d, d+] = 2dd+, the original denition of f in (2.5a)
is merely a minor simplication of f = 1
4 [d, d+]|, and the analogous applies to the
denitions (2.5bd). however, since [d+, d+] = 2d+d+2i=| , the denitions of l=| , r=
in eqs. (2.5e, f) imply

4(cid:2)d+, d+(cid:3)| ;
4(cid:2)d, d(cid:3)| ;

d+d+| = i=| | + 1
dd| = i=| + 1

2(cid:2)d+, d+(cid:3)| = i=|  + 2l=| ,
2(cid:2)d, d(cid:3)| = i=r + 2r= .

(2.6a)

(2.6b)

these denitions will produce more symmetry in derivations of lagrangian densities.

component diagrammatics
in analyzing the component eld content of constrained superelds, the reader may nd
it convenient to use the diagram in fig. 1. a component is obtained by acting on the
supereld with one of the operators from the diagram, and then setting =0=.

applying further (super)derivatives merely produces total derivatives of the already

 8 

of a more mathematical persuasion may appreciate the fact that the diagram in fig. 1
shows the projection operators (with the setting of =0= understood) on the components
of v , where v is a 4-dimensional vector space spanned by d, d. the diagram itself
then represents the exact sequence

1  v  2v  3v  4v = 1 .

using the diagram in fig. 1 as a guide, the components of a general, unconstrained

complex supereld a may be listed as

note that the subscripts on a, a indicate that they were obtained from [d, d+]a|
and [d+, d]a|, respectively. finally, the numerical coecients, as in (2.5a), are herein
set:

2 for every commutator. thus, for example,

the minor simplifying departure in eqs. (2.5c, d) from this convention, which dictates
x, x instead of the simpler x, x, hopefully causes no undue confusion.

elimination of component elds

consider, for example, a supereld annihilated by d+. the component elds obtained by
projection after acting with some superderivatives including d+ either vanish or become
total derivatives of lower components. all these components are connected by the criss-
cross lines in fig. 1, following to the right of d+; they are shown in the shaded area of the
diagram in fig 2.

pair d=0=d+ are obtained using the derivatives in the shaded area; their
overlap is shaded darker. unshaded remain the operators which project on the
independent components of the chiral supereld, : see eqs. (2.5a).

note that there is an overlap of the two shaded areas: the derivatives projecting onto
the component elds that are elliminated both by d+=0 and by d=0. presently, this
is of no concern, but will turn up again later.

clearly, the component eld content of all constrained superelds (2.1) and (2.3) can
be treated in much the same way. unfortunately, while this does give a quick indication of
the independent component eld content, it does not specify the dependences. for example,
such diagrams do indicate that the right-hand side of eq. (2.6a) is a linear combination
of l=| and a derivative (clearly, =| ) of a component eld two columns to the left in the
diagram (clearly, ). such diagrams, by themselves, do not however specify the numerical
contstants of the linear combination, here 2 and i, respectively. these details, while not
dicult to guess, should be veried by direct calculation.

unidexterity superconstraints
we have noted before that the pair of superconstraints (2.1e) includes the spacetime con-
straint, = = 0, and that (2.1f) similarly includes =|  = 0. the quick argument based
on

d = 0

d = 0(cid:27) 

dd = 0

dd = 0(cid:27) (cid:8)d, d(cid:9) = 2i= = 0 ,

is somewhat misleading in suggesting that (=)=0 is somehow a consequence of (2.1e),
and so a secondary constraint; a clarication may thus be welcome. to that end, let us
study the content of eqs. (2.1e) on the component elds. start with an unconstrained
(general) supereld, , and dene  to mean setting =0=, but leaving  +,  + intact.
then, we dene the (still  +,  +-dependent! ) , -component (0,2)-superelds:

(2.10)

 def= (cid:5) , 

or  = (;,; l=).

def= 12

 != 0):

(2.12a)

(2.12b)

(2.12c)

(2.12d)

(2.12e)

(2.12f)

where != is the equality of the enforced (super)constraint. we have used only the operatorial
identity

{d, d} = 0 ,  [d, d]d  {d, d}d ,

(2.13)

and its conjugate.

clearly, the sum of eqs.(2.12b) and (2.12e) equals the spacetime constraint, = !=
0, for all of the haploid (0,2)-supereld . their dierence produces l=which is in
point of fact also contained both in (2.12a) and in (2.12d). to summarize then, the
superconstraints (2.1e) contain the (simple) constraints:
and ,, l=

(2.14)
that is, the vanishing of three quarters (,, l=) of the unconstrained supereld 
and the vanishing of the right-moving modes of all the component elds in the haploid
supereld  are all contained in eqs. (2.1e); their content is identical to that of eqs. (2.14)!

(=) != 0 ,

!= 0 .

 11 

thus, the various stages (columns) of the derivation (2.10) are consistent, but also
unnecessary. eqs. (2.14) merely expand the original superdierential system (2.1e), which
contains all the (super)constraints; there are no further, induced, (super)constraints to be
derived in the lagrangian formalism used here. the strategy in the hamiltonian (dirac,
brst, etc.) formalism will depend crucially on the conjugate momenta, and so on the
choice of the lagrangian density. this again is beyond our present scope, as we seek
to present the (reasonably) general case rather than belabor the detailsand consequent
restrictionsof specic models.

quartoid supereld components

the component elds of the quartoid superelds (2.3) are easily obtained, by truncation,
from those of the haploid ones (2.5):

l

def= l| ,
def= l| ,

(2.15a)

(2.15b)

(2.15c)

(2.15d)

all the superelds dened in eqs. (2.1) and (2.3) are spin-0 superelds,

in that
their lowest components (2.5) are all spin-0 elds. for these to be standard physical
(pseudo)scalar elds, we x their canonical dimension to be the standard 0. thence, the
canonical dimensions of all spinors in (2.5) is the standard + 1
2 .

2.4. spinning superelds and superdierential relations

the eqs. (2.1) dene scalar superelds, i.e., the lowest component elds of , , , , , 
are scalar elds. it is easy to endow the whole supereld with (overall) additional spin,
say   +, so that the lowest component +| = + has spin + 1
2 (see appendix a).
next, it is also possible to relate the (anti)chiral and the twisted (anti)chiral superelds
via a superdierential relation. for example, let + be a spin-up (overall spin + 1
2 ) chiral
supereld; then  def= (d++) is a scalar (overall spin 0) twisted chiral supereld, since

in particular, note that although d++ = 0,

d+(d++) = 0 = d(d++) .

d+(d++) = (2i=|  d+d+)+ = 2i=| + 6= 0 .

(2.16)

(2.17)

this then implies that there will exist (dierential) relations among the component elds

 12 

of + and  def= (d++), as follows:

x def= | =(cid:0)d++(cid:1)| = 2+

+ ,



+

def= 12
def= 12
x def= 1

d| = 12(cid:0)dd++(cid:1)| = 2f + ,
d+| = 12(cid:0)d+d++(cid:1)| = 2i(=| +) ,
2(cid:0)dd+d++(cid:1)| = 2i(=| +
2 dd+| = 1

) .

def= (d+)

(2.18)

also, since the canonical (scaling) dimension of d and d is [d] = [d] = + 1
2 ,
the component elds in  def= d++ will have their canonical dimensions shifted by + 1
2
compared to those in +. for example, the lowest component of + is the spinor + and
so should (in 2-dimensional spacetime), have [+] = 1
2 . thus,
2 , and [x] = 2none of which are the correct canonical dimensions of
[x] = 1, [
physical (propagating) elds in 2-dimensional spacetime. if a mass/energy parameter, m,
m (d++) has component elds of

] = 1 and [f +] = 3

2 ; then [+

is available in the model, the rescaled supereld e def= 1

correct (physical) canonical dimensions.

alternatively, with  a scalar (overall spin-0) twisted chiral supereld, +

] = 3

is a spin  1

2 chiral supereld since

again, the component elds of  and +

def= (d+) are related as follows:

d+(d+) = 0 = d(d+) .

+

=|

f+

def= +| = (d+)| = 2+ ,
 def= 12
def= 12
def= 1

d+| = 12(cid:0)dd+(cid:1)| = 2x ,
d++| = 12(cid:0)d+d+(cid:1)| = 2i(=| x) ,

2 dd++| = 1

2(cid:0)dd+d+(cid:1)| = 2i(=| ) .

def= (d+) will
again, the canonical (scaling) dimensions of the component elds of +
each have their canonical dimensions shifted by + 1
2 compared to those in . so, if all
the component elds of  have correct canonical dimensions, not all of those of + do.
whilst [+] = [+] = 1
2 is the correct canonical dimension for a dynamical spinor, and
[=| ] = [=| x] = 1 and [] = [f ] = 1 are correct for a component of a vector and an
auxiliary eld, respectively, [f+] = [=| ] = 3

2 is too high for a dynamical spinor.

this suggests that superderivatives of superelds generally have fewer dynamical com-
ponent elds than the original superelds. furthermore, the unphysical canonical dimen-
sions of the component elds of superderivative superelds allow for higher derivative terms
in the action. throughout this article and with one noted exception below, we will include
such superderivative superelds only if this does not lead to higher derivative terms.

 13 

note that no superderivative of either of , , ,  satises the unidexterous super-
constraints (2.1e, f). thus, it is not possible to construct lefton or righton superelds from
the (twisted) (anti)chiral superelds , , , .

conversely however, superderivatives of leftons and rightons do satisfy some of the
(twisted) (anti)chiral conditions. in fact, these are annihilated by three superderivatives
and are quartoid , no longer merely haploid, superelds. thus:

 (d+) is a chiral lefton (2.3a), and (d+) an antichiral lefton (2.3b),
 (d) is a chiral righton (2.3c), and (d) an antichiral righton (2.3d).

2.5. second-order constrained superelds

the hitherto discussed and thoroughly familiar (anti)chiral superelds (2.1a, b), their some-
what less well known twisted counterparts (2.1c, d), and the unidexterous elds (2.1e, f)
and (2.3), are all dened by satisfying a system of rst order superconstraints. clearly,
there is more.

the obvious generalization of the (quite simple) rst-order superconstraints (2.1)

1. nm-chiral :

2. nm-antichiral :

and (2.3) are the (equally simple) second-order superconstraints:
d+d = 0 ,
dd+ = 0 ,
d+d = 0 ,
dd+ = 0 ,
[d, d]a = 0 ,
[d+, d+]u = 0 .

4. nm-twisted-antichiral :

6. nm-(almost)-righton :

5. nm-(almost)-lefton :

3. nm-twisted-chiral :

(2.19a)

(2.19b)

(2.19c)

(2.19d)

(2.19e)

(2.19f)

these are called linear, or as better bets the extendedness of their dening supercon-
straints in comparison with (2.1), non-minimal [11,6,12]. note that the minimal haploid
superelds (2.1) obey the second-order superconstraints (2.19), but that the non-minimal
ones (2.19) do not obey the rst-order superconstraints (2.1).

again, the latter two of the superconstraints (2.19) are set apart from the former
four, although the divide is not as sharp as between the minimal unidexterous super-
elds (2.1e, f) from the ambidexterous ones (2.1ad). to see this, let us examine their
component eld content.

ambidexterous non-minimal superelds
the component eld content is straightorward to obtain, only this time there are more
component elds than in eqs. (2.5). for example,

the unshaded derivatives project on the independent component elds of , as
dened by eqs. (2.20.)

note that the shaded area of fig. 5 coincides with the darker shaded area of fig. 4.
indeed, trivially so: the former covers the derivatives dening the component elds elimi-
nated by projection with d+d, the latter  with either of d+, d.

comparing the component eld content of corresponding superelds, the non-minimal
superelds (2.19ad) contain three times as many component elds as do the minimal
ones (2.1ad). as it turns out, however, with rather typical lagrangian densities for such
superelds (even when interacting with some of the others), the equations of motion for
the extra component elds turn out to be algebraic (see, e.g., ref.[6], p.200). this allows
an easy ellimination of all the extra component elds, and the remaining component
eld content of the non-minimal superelds (2.19ad) turns out to be identical to their
minimal counterparts (2.1ad). to indicate this, we may list the component eld context
as

 = (t; ; t : ; t, t, t=, t=| ; ) ,
 = (t; ; t : ; t, t, t =, t =| ; ) ,
 = (p; , +; p : , +; p, p, p=, p=| ;e, +) ,
 = (p; , +; p : , +; p, p, p =, p =| ;e, +) ,

(2.21b)

(2.21c)

(2.21d)

where the colon separates o the extra component elds by which non-minimal superelds
dier from their minimal counterparts.

thus, the physical component eld warrants the adjective haploid also for the non-
minimal superelds, as they depend on the other half of the four supercoordinates, , 
only by the inclusion of auxiliary component elds.

furthermore, the non-minimal superelds (2.19) are dual to their rst-order con-
strained counterparts (2.1) (see, e.g., ref. [6], p.200). this tempts a straightforward
dismissal of the non-minimal superelds. however, while the use of these non-minimal
superelds instead of the minimal ones seems to merely harbor unnecessary toil, there do
exist distinct benets of using the minimal and the non-minimal superelds together [12].
we will therefore include them in the subsequent analysis, where appropriate.

figure 6. the darkest shade indicates the derivatives dening the (independent)
component elds eliminated by the superconstraint d+d=0. the medium

extra component elds. compare this with fig. 4.

the above results are displays diagrammatically in fig. 6. note that the derivatives in
the lightest and medium shaded areas separately each have the structure of the derivatives
dening the (independent) component elds of a minimal chiral supereld. this moti-
vated the realization that the denition (2.19a) is invariant with respect to the (rather
peculiar) inhomogeneous gauge transformation

 =  +  ++ , where d = 0 = d+ ,

to the following inhomogeneous gauge transformations:

 =  +  ++ , where d = 0 = d+ ,
 =  +  ++ , where d = 0 = d+ .

of course, most lagrangian densities will explicitly violate this gauge symmetry (2.22),
and a possible use of this gauge symmetry remains an open question for a later study.

(almost) unidexterous non-minimal superelds
before we specify the component eld content of the non-minimal superelds (2.19e, f),
let us examine the content of the second order superdierential contraints (2.19e, f). to
this end, consider a previously unconstrained general (2,2)-supereld, a with (still  +,  +-
dependent! ) component (0,2)-supereld content a = (a; ,a; a=), and project on the
components of [d, d]a:

(2.24a)

(2.24b)

(2.24c)

(2.24d)

the component elds are easily dened in analogy with eqs. (2.20), and we denote

= a= ,

0 !=(cid:0)[d, d]a(cid:1)(cid:5)
0 !=(cid:0) 12
0 !=(cid:0) 12
0 !=(cid:0) 1

d[d, d]a(cid:1)(cid:5)
d[d, d]a(cid:1)(cid:5)
2 [d, d][d, d]a(cid:1)(cid:5) = (2
them a = (a; +, a+; a=| : , a; a=, a, a, a, a; @+,e@+).

= +2i(=a) ,

=a) .

just as with the ambidexterous non-minimal superelds, the dening supercon-
straint (2.19e) is again invariant with respect to the inhomogeneous gauge transformation

a = 1

 + 2

 = 0 = di

 , where di

which precisely suces to elliminate the extra component elds, , a, a=, a, a, a,

a, @+,e@+, all of which are contained in  and a. the remaining component elds are

(a; +, a+; a=| ), and are contained in a but neither in  nor in a. this has the peculiar
consequence that the component elds (a; +, a+; a=| ) obey the superconstraint (2.24d),
but not (2.24b, c). that is, the component elds (a; +, a+; a=| ) are not purely left-movers,
but are linear functions of = and arbitrary functions of =| .

i = 1, 2 ,

 ,

the analogous analysis shows that the non-minimal righton has the following com-
ponent elds u = (u; , ; u= : +, +; u, u, u, u; , ). its denition is invariant
with respect to the gauge transformation

i = 1, 2 ,

finally, we recall that an analytic function of any one type of minimal haploid (quar-
toid) superelds (2.1) and (2.3) is again a haploid (quartoid) supereld, and of the same
type. for example, any analytic function f () of chiral superelds, , is again chiral:
f () satises the same superconstraints (2.1a). in contradistinction, only linear combina-
tions of non-minimal superelds of the same type (2.19af ) satisfy the same supercon-
straint. no non-linear function of any non-minimal superelds satises any one of the
non-minimal superconstraints (2.19af )they are all general, unconstrained superelds.

 17 

minimization of non-minimal superelds

as observed in the literature [4], superderivatives of non-minimal superelds may become
minimal. for example, consider the non-minimal chiral supereld (2.19a), , satisfying
d+d = 0. then both (d+) and (d) are minimal chiral superelds; indeed,

d+(d+)  0 ,
d(d)  0 ,

d(d+) = 0 ;
d+(d) = 0 .

(2.25)

however, (d+) and (d) are not even non-minimal haploid superelds: they are an-
nihilated by only one of the four superderivatives.

in this way, every non-minimal ambidexterous supereld (2.19a)-(2.19d) provides two

minimal haploid superelds (2.1ad) of the corresponding kind:

(d+), (d)
(d+), (d)
(d+), (d)
(d+), (d)

are chiral (2.1a) ,

are antichiral (2.1b) ,

are twisted-chiral (2.1c) ,

are twisted-antichiral (2.1d) .

(2.26a)

(2.26b)

(2.26c)

(2.26d)

the same is not true for the unidexterous superelds. consider the non-minimal

lefton, a, satisfying [d, d]a = 0. then,

d(da)  0 , but d(da) = i(=a) 6= 0 ;
d(da)  0 , but d(da) = i(=a) 6= 0 .

(2.27)

however, there are analogous relations between unidexterous haploid and quartoid super-
elds. it is easy to check that

(d+)

(d+)
(d)
(d)

is a chiral lefton (2.3a) ,

is an antichiral lefton (2.3b) ,

is a chiral righton (2.3c) ,

the order of derivatives has been terminated at two only so as to prohibit higher derivative
and/or negative-dimension coecient terms in the lagrangian density.

finally, as it will be useful when constructing lagrangian densities, we list (su-
perderivative) superelds which are annihilated by at least one of the superderivatives.
any analytic function of these is then also annihilated by at least that one superderivative,
and forms the kernel of that superderivative:

2.6. other (super)constraints

having listed the simple rst-order and second-order superconstraints (2.1) and (2.19),
respectively, it should be clear that even this is by far not all there is. one may also dene

the sixteen components of a so far unconstrained supereld:

yet higher order superconstraints

having examined rst and second order (simple) superconstraints in some detail, the in-
quisitive reader will naturally wonder about third order superconstraints. the second
order constraints examined in  2.5 seem to produce merely a technically more involved
cousins of the minimal haploid superelds 2.1. whereas the minimal superelds are
constrained by two simple, rst order superconstraints which set three quarters of the
component elds to zero, the non-minimal ones are constrained by a single, second-order
superconstraint which sets only one quarter of the component elds to zero; the balance
of a half of the component elds (eight of them) present in a non-minimal supereld but
not in a minimal one are the extra component elds which in known applications turn
out to be non-physical 6).

navely then, we expect a cubic (simple) superconstraint to set only an eighth (two)
of the component elds to zero. also, we expect several of the non-vanishing components
turning out to be auxiliary (with algebraic, i.e., non-dierential equations of motion), the
precise identication possibly strongly depending on the choice of the lagrangian density.

this turns out to be only partially true; in particular, the rst expectation turns out

to be wrong.

let us examine the case

[d, d]d+ = 0 .

(2.32)

easily, by projecting on the lowest component of (2.32), this includes the simple statement
that

(2.33)

0 != [d, d]d+(cid:12)(cid:12) def= 42o ,

so o = 0. projecting with d, d and d (d+ of course trivially annihilates the whole
superconstraint), we obtain the next three component constraints:

0 != 4i(=w ) ,

0 != 4(=w) ,

0 != 4i(=| w=)  8o .

(2.34)

these imply, respectively, that w and w are left-movers, and that the top component
eld, o, is not independent, but equals o = i
2 (=| w=). continuing this, with the quadratic
and cubic superdierential operators from fig. 1 which do not include d+, we obtain four

6) recall that the property of a component eld being physical, i.e., propagating (with a dif-

ferential equation of motion) depends most crucially on the choice of the lagrangian density!

 20 

more constraints. the net eect of the superconstraint (2.32) is then summarized by
writing (in a hopefully obivous doublet notation):

2
={+, w=| } = {0, i

={w, o+} = {0, i

={w,eo+} = {0, i
{eo, o} = {0, i

2 (2
==| w)} ,
2 (==| )} ,
2 (==| )} ,
2 (=| w=)} ,

{w, +} is free,
{, w} is free,
{, w} is free,
{w=, o} is free.

(2.35a)

(2.35b)

(2.35c)

(2.35d)

thus, half of the component elds, in the right column of eqs. (2.35), are untouched by the
superconstraint (2.32); a quarter of the component elds obey a dierential relationship
to a half of the free component elds. finally, an eighth of the component elds (w and
w ) become left-movers, one component eld (+) an almost left-mover, and only one

component eld,eo outright vanishes. the fact that these results can be organized into the

doublet formation of (2.35) is a simple consequence that these doublets form  +-dependent
(0, 1)-superelds, d+ being the one superderivative not appearing in eq. (2.32).

the straightforward expectations stated above did not turn out to be true simply
because the superderivative operators do not commute, whereupon the counting of inde-
pendent degrees of freedom remaining unconstrained by a superconstraint is far from (that)
simple. obviously, there are four (essentially distinct) cubic simple superconstraints, and
a single quartic one.

having illustrated this point and with the utility of these superelds entirely unex-

plored, we now turn to some other, more radically novel possibilities.

non-simple superconstraints

the (again) rst-order superconstraint

denes an independent pair of haploid (in fact, lefton) superelds. to see this, switch to
the (0,2)-supereld notation as in eq. (2.11) and (2.24), and dene

(d  d) = 0

(2.36)

(2.37)

w def= (cid:5) , 

def= 12

d(cid:5) , 

def= 12

d(cid:5) , w=

def= 1

4 [d, d](cid:5) ,

where  denotes setting =0= but leaving  +,  + intact. taking the same projections of
the superconstraint (2.36), we obtain the (0,2)-superconstraints, which almost immediately
yield:

 =  , w= = 0 ,

(= w) = 0 ,

and (=) = 0 .

(2.38)

thus, the supereld obeying the superconstraint (2.36) consists of a spin 0 left-moving
(haploid) supereld, w = (w; +, +; w=| ), and two identical copies of a spin + 1
2 left-
moving (haploid) supereld,  = (; w, w; o+).

note that the complex conjugate of eq. (2.36) merely states that , the hermitian

conjugate of , satises the identical superconstraint, not that  is real.

 21 

multi-eld constraints

of course, there is no a priori reason to restrict oneself to (super)constraints involving
only one supereld. for example, given a chiral supeeld, , and a twisted-chiral one, ,
the superconstraint

d+  d+ != 0

(2.39)

clearly identies the fermionic component elds + = + (by straightforward projection).
on projecting with d:

d(d+  d+)| = 2(f  x) != 0 ,

(2.40)

we nd that the auxiliary elds f and x are also identied. projecting further on the
remaining six components (using all the superderivative operators from fig. 1 which do
not include trivially acting d), we nd that the superconstraint (2.39) includes the above
identications, but also forces all of the components of both  and  to be right-moving!
that is, eq. (2.39) includes also the constraints (=| ) = 0 = (=| ).

what navely started out as identifying only some two subsets of two superelds,
turned out to have a quite more restrictive end. it is thus imperative to always expand all
the superconstraint(s) in their component constraints, so as to identify their full eect.

inhomogeneous superconstraints

next, one may wish to attempt mixed-order (inhomogeneous in the ds) superconstraints.
so, consider

(cid:0)1l  1

2 dd+(cid:1) = 0 ,

which, a bit surprisingly, turns out to annihilate the whole supereld! to see this, we
switch to an antichiral (1,1)-supereld notation, expanding in the s, but keeping the
component (1,1)-superelds still dependent on the s. dene

w def= (cid:7) , 

def= 12

d(cid:7) , w def= 1

2 dd+(cid:7) ,

where  denotes setting =0 but leaving  intact. projecting in the similar fashion the
superconstraint (2.42), we obtain, respectively:
w = w ,  = 0 ,

and w = 0 .

(2.43)

(2.41)

(2.42)

(2.44)

combined, they set the whole supereld obeying (2.42) to zero.

another easy (and far less trivial) example is

(cid:0)1l  1

4 [d, d][d+, d+](cid:1) = 0 ,

which does not annihilate , but restricts all the component elds to solutions of simple
dierential equations:

(1  ==| ){ w, w, o} = 0 ,

(1 + ==| ){ w, w} = 0 ,

(1  2

=2

=| ){ w; , ; w=, w=| ; o,eo } = 0 ,

 22 

(2.45)

where, of course, (1  2
are restricted on the mass shell, their mass being 1.

=2
=|

)  (1  ==| )(1 + ==| ). in this case, all component elds

families of superconstraints
we next consider a notion that appears to be novel in supersymmetry, but has become
fairly familiar in superstring theory: we construct families of constraints.

a small modication of the superconstraint (2.41):

(cid:0)1l  1

2 dd+(cid:1) = 0 ,

 = const.,  6= 0,  ,

(2.46)

now involves a parameter . as it turns out, this superconstraint family still annihilates
the supereld  and so introduces nothing new. the limiting value  = 0 may thus un
fact me included without any change in the enforced vanishing of . however, the limiting
case  =  turns  into an non-minimal antichiral supereldfar from vanishing.

on the other hand, consider the pair of superconstraints:

(2.47)

(cid:2) sin( 1

2 )d+  cos( 1

2 )d+(cid:3) = 0 = d .

clearly, the special cases  = 0 and  =  constrain  to be a chiral or a twisted-
chiral supereld, respectively. that is, the family of superconstraints (2.47), parametrized
by the angle , interpolates continuously between chiral and twissted-chiral superelds!
this may seem perplexing, since the swap c+ :  was at rst regarded as a discrete
symmetry, whereas it is now shown to be a continuous so(2)  u (1) symmetry. in fact,
this transformation may be identied with the u (1)l subgroup of the general su (2)+ group
acting on the doublet of supercoordinates  +,  +, which in turn is the left-handed half of
su (2)+su (2), the maximal compact group of transformations of the supercoordinates
,  which commutes with the lorentz symmetry; see  1.3.

it is then natural to ask what does  of eq. (2.46) become for angles  6= 0, . straight-
forwardly, the superconstraint system (2.47) then denes a pair of chiral leftons (2.3a),
(r, r+). in the limiting cases, we nd

 =

(, ) 
0
 r+ = (r+, r+)
(+, f )

r = (r , r)

 (x, )

 (+, x)

=  .

(2.48)

the upper halves (as displayed here) of  and  are easy to map to each other, and in fact
identify: both pairs of component elds are projected the same way. in contradistinction,
the mapping of the lower halves, (+, f )  (r+, r+)  (+, x), is non-trivial and
involves the twist d+d+. the relation (2.48) then shows how the pair of chiral rightons
interpolates between a chiral and a twisted-chiral supereld.



relation to dualities
since the chiraltwisted-chiral mapping may be identied as the root of the mirror
map [13], the interpolation (2.48) may provide a more complete description. while a
detailed study of this is beyond our present scope, we cannot help noticing that is but one
element of the discrete symmetry 2s4 identied in  1.3. another operation, the left-handed

 23 

(or the right-handed, of course) parity, denoted p in (1.10c, d), but when acting also on the
world-sheet coordinates, was identied in ref. [14] as the root of the type iiatype iib
duality. with a total of 47 nontrivial operations, the group of discrete symmetries 2s4
from  1.3 seems to be a pretty good candidate for seeking roots of other dualities in
(super)string, m- and f-theories.

fibration of superconstraints
let us, however, return to the 1-parameter family of superconstraints (2.46). in retrospect,
it is almost trivial, since all values of  6=  lead to  = 0. exceptionally, at  = ,
 6= 0 and is in fact a non-minimal antichiral supereld! that is, the 1-dimensional
parameter space { 6= }  ir1 is bered with identical bres, parametrized by the
identical constrained supereld,  = 0. compactifying { 6= }  ir1 into {}  s1,
by including the  =  point, the bration becomes quite non-trivial. one can think of
the total space of this bration as a simple cover of s1 (parametrized by the constant and
trivial value =0), with one exceptional set, e, at  = , where e is parametrized by
the non-minimal antichiral supereld satisfying dd+ = 0.

a bit more interestingly perhaps, the 1-parameter family of superconstraints (2.47)
is clearly non-trivial, since dierent values of  lead to dierent (constrained) superelds.
again, however, the parameter space, {}  s1 is bred mostly by a pair of chiral rightons.
at the two special points,  = 0,  however, this 2 + 2-dimensional bre, (r, r+), fuses
into a single 4-dimensional one,  and , respectively. in fact, it is easy to turn (2.47) into
a bration over a (complex!) ip1:

(z1d+  z2d+) = 0 = d ,

(2.49)
where the two complex numbers (z1, z2)  (z1, z2) parametrize a complex projec-
tive (parameter) space, ip1. note that the invariance under rescaling by a non-zero -
nite complex parameter, , arises as the obious symmetry of the homogeneous equation
(z1d+z2d+) = 0. the chiral and twisted-chiral superelds, , , are then seen as
special bres (the north and the south poles, respectively) in a non-trivial bration of the
righton doublet (r, r+) over ip1.

non-linear superconstraints
whereas the simple modication (2.46) of the superconstraint (2.41) produced an (almost)
trivial outcome, a further but still simple modication

produces a rather more interesting situation. to see this, switch back to the (1,1)-supereld
notation, expanding in the s, but leaving the component elds still superfunctions of
the s. using the denitions in (2.42) and writing f (n)  f (n)(w), we nd that the
superconstraint (2.50) includes

(2.50)

(cid:0)1l  1

2 f ()dd+(cid:1) = 0 ,

w  f w != 0 ,
[f  w f] != 0 ,
w(cid:0)[f  w f] + + f f(cid:1) != 0 .

 24 

(2.51)

w,  =( free

0

if f () = /w0,
if f () 6= /w0 ,

w0

def= lim

0(cid:0)/f ()(cid:1) .

(2.52)

the rst constraint simply sets w = w/f . with the latter two, this then enforces  =
(w; ; w/f ), where:

again, we have a (degenerate) bration: over the parameter space of the function f , we
generically have the constant  = (0; 0, 0; w0), while at the special subset where f becomes
a constant multiple of its argument, we have the unconstrained but only 3
4 - independent

supereld,  =(cid:0)w; ; w/f(cid:1) which, in the limit f   becomes a non-minimal antichiral

supereld, as found above. recall that w,  in turn are otherwise unconstrained -
dependent (1, 1)-superelds.

other non-homogeneous superderivative constraints may produce less trivial results
and dene other possibly interesting constrained superelds. reasons for using such more
complicated superconstraints are both far from obvious and model-dependent 7). whilst
one is tempted to dismiss such more complicated constrained superelds on grounds of
physical equivalence to (some combination of) minimal haploid and quartoid superelds
at the cost of greater technical complexity, it may well be that their joint use oers some
distinct advantage, as does the use of minimal together with non-minimal superelds [12].
more than a mere mention of this possibility, however, is beyond our present scope.

discrete constraints

finally, the imposition of reality as a constraint on a supereld is probably the best known
type of constraint: v  != v denes a real supereld, used for yang-mills type gauge vec-
tors [5,6]. note that the hermiticity of the entire supereld does not imply the hermiticity
of the component elds. in fact, v   c(v ) != v implies that, e.g., the lowest component
is real, but the 1

2 d+dv | components are imaginary.

2 dd+v | and 1

in view of our analysis of discrete symmetries of the 2-dimensional (2,2)-superspacetime,
it is clear that there are many, many more such constraints possible. for example,
p (w ) != w denes a left-right (parity) symmetric, i.e., scalar supereld; c(y ) != y
imposes a reality condition but only on the , -components; etc. there being 47 non-
trivial elements of 2s4, there are 47 such types of constraints possible in the 2-dimensional
(2,2)-superspacetime, and they can of course be combined with the superdierential oper-
ators to produce some quite formiddably looking constraints.

again, an exhaustive analysis of all possibilities is clearly out of hand, and presently
we remain content with the minimal haploid superelds, and a brief involvment of their
non-minimal counterparts.

7) i thank joe polchinski for discussions on this point, and sharing some early results of his work
with simeon hellerman on some superconstraint eqations generalizing the present eq. (2.49) into
a fully non-linear (albeit holomorphic) superconstraints in . their work focuses on applications
in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. the present models can be dimensionally reduced to such
theories, albeit with some possible loss of generality, just as dimensional reduction of 4-dimensional
models fails to capture most of the diversity presented herein.

 25 

3. lagrangian densities

once the superelds have beed dened, we can turn to their dynamics, to be governed by
a lagrangian density. as it turns out, 2-dimensional (2,2)-supersymmetric models have
an unprecedented rich set of choices for the lagrangian density, and consequently for the
dynamics.

3.1. unconstrained formalism

owing to the nilpotency of the superderivatives, the complex ambidexterous constrained
superelds can be expressed as superderivatives of unconstrained ones [6]. for example,
given an unconstrained complex supereld, , the following are minimal haploid super-
elds:

(d+d) is chiral,
(d+d) is antichiral,
(d+d) is twisted-chiral,
(d+d) is twisted-antichiral,

i.e., it obeys eqs. (2.1a) ,

i.e., it obeys eqs. (2.1b) ,

i.e., it obeys eqs. (2.1c) ,

i.e., it obeys eqs. (2.1d) .

(3.1a)

(3.1b)

(3.1c)

(3.1d)

similarly, given two unconstrained complex superelds, , the following dene non-
minimal haploid superelds:

(d++ + d) is nm-chiral,
(d++ + d) is nm-antichiral,
(d++ + d) is nm-twisted-chiral,
i.e., it obeys eqs. (2.19c) ,
(d++ + d) is nm-twisted-antichiral, i.e., it obeys eqs. (2.19d) .

i.e., it obeys eqs. (2.19a) ,

i.e., it obeys eqs. (2.19b) ,

(3.2a)

(3.2b)

(3.2c)

(3.2d)

amusingly, both the minimal and the non-minimal unidexterous superelds elude a sim-
ilarly easy description in terms of unconstrained superelds.

this then denes an unconstrained formalism where each of the constrained super-
elds (2.1ad) and (2.19ad) is meticulously replaced by its proxy (3.1) and (3.2), respec-
tively. quantization is now straightforward in terms of path-integrals over the components
of the unconstrained superelds  used in (3.1), and  used in (3.2). this approach is
however unavoidably beset with a substantially increased amount of sheer algebra, and
will not be pursued herein.

3.2. constrained formalism

with a collection of several constrained superelds of the types dened in eqs. (2.5),
we now seek the most general lagrangian density (subject to some hopefully plausible
restrictions). consider an analytic function, f , of some of the haploid superelds (2.1). in
general [5,6], the berezin integral of this f over only those , s on which f does depend
will transform under a general supersymmetry transformation into a total derivative. a
world-sheet integral of such a berezin integral is then, up to world-sheet boundary terms,

 26 

invariant under supersymmetry. when considering only world-sheets without a boundary,
as we do, such berezin integrals provide supersymmetric lagrangian densities.

with the benet of hindsight, we discuss the details of the various lagrangian density
terms starting with those which require the most number of berezin integrations. also, for
now, the quantization issues pertaining to the unidexterous (super)elds will be completely
ignored, and all expressions will use fully constrained (super)elds.

finally, while any supereld can be assigned overall spin as discussed in  2.4, for
reasonos that will soon become obvious, we consider endowing only a subset of the unidex-
terous superelds with overall spin. we write  = (a, a=| ), where the superelds counted
by the index a remain as dened in (2.1e), while those indexed by a satisfy j3(=| ) = 1, so
that j3{=| , =|+, =|+, l=|
2 , 1
=| } = {1, 1
2 , 0}. a susbset of the rightons is similarly endowed with
overall spin 1:  = (, =).
the general lagrangian density
the most general manifestly supersymmetric lagrangian density is of the following form:

recall that fermionic integration is equivalent to (covariant) superderivative(s), followed
by the projection on the body, =0=:

l = 1

for the above expressions to be supersymmetric, it is necessary and sucient for each inte-
grand to be annihilated by all covariant superderivatives except those which are equivalent
to the integration operator. for example, + should be a chiral lefton, annihilated by
all superderivatives except d+, which appears explicitly in (3.4a), replacing the integral

r d in (3.3a). similarly, w has to be chiral,  twisted-chiral, m + has to be annihilated

by d, etc. k is always chosen to be real, so that no +h.c. is necessary.

the name to all other two-fermionic integrals in (3.3b, c), i.e., (3.4b, c). the  4 component

ther d w + h.c. terms are frequently called the f-terms as ther d interal projects
being typically called d in a general supereld, ther d4-term (3.3e), i.e., (3.4e) is typically

called the d-term. in a similar vein, we call the terms in (3.3a), i.e., (3.4a) the -terms,
and those in (3.3d), i.e., (3.4d) the -terms.

3.3. d-term

we begin with the most generally , -dependent set of terms, those that depend on

all four of them, and so appear under ther d4 integral (1.7). since non-minimal super-

elds (2.19) do depend on all four fermionic coordinates, this is in fact the only type of
terms in which they can appear (without a superderivative acting on them). the hasty
reader should be reminded that the combined use of minimal and non-minimal haploid
superelds does have its distinct advantages and interest (see, e.g., ref. [12]), whence here
we include quartoid and both the minimal and the (ambidexterous) non-minimal hap-
loid superelds. the reader should then have no problem extending the presented results
by including the unidexterous non-minimal superelds, and also the other superelds
discussed in  2.6, or indeed yet other ones, of their own design.

the d-term involving the haploid superelds is

lk = 1

4z d4 k(, , , , , , , , , , . . .) ,

(3.5)

where the ellipses denote non-minimal superelds, and k(. . .) is required to be a real
function for the lagrangian (term) lk to be hermitian. note that this implies, e.g., that
def=  k = k,  and k,  = k,  are hermitian, but k,ab , k,ij are merely
k,
symmetric, and all the mixed matrices are general. we do not, however, allow k to
depend on superderivative superelds, as that would lead to higher derivative terms in the
lagrangian density.

finally, as =| and = carry overall spin, and since k has spin-0 and it is not allowed
to depend on superderivatives, it must be that k depends on the =| , = only through
their spinless products, (=| =). such products are characterized by a list of matrices, m
a,
where m indexes all the linearly independent bilinear products, bm def= (a=| m
a=). the
a may be chosen so as to have all entries 0, except for the mth one (counting
matrices m
say elements in row after row) which then equals 1. then,

(3.7)

with these, the lagrangian density is straightforward to expand into component elds;
see appendix b.

 28 

3.4. -terms

we now seek fermionic functions which are annihilated by one of the four d, ds. since
, , their d-superderivatives, , (d+), (d+) and (danything) are all annihilated
by d, the berezin integral over ,  of any analytic function of these superelds is a
suitable lagrangian density term:

lm + = 1

4z d2 dm +(l , r, l ; , , ; . . .) + h.c. ,

(3.8)

as supersymmetry transforms it into a total derivative 8). recall that the component
elds (2.15) of the quartoid superelds l , r, l, r are obtained from those (2.5a, b)
of the chiral and antichiral haploid superelds. we can therefore lump l , r into  and
l , r into  without any loss of generality; the interested reader should have no diculty
re-introducing them by splitting the ranges:   (, l, r) and   (, l , r ), and
remembering that the quartoid superelds have only half the component elds of a haploid
one. here, the quartoid superelds are explicitly written only if they do not appear in pairs
that comprise a haploid supereld.

now, prohibiting as before higher derivative (negative dimensional coecient) terms,

and ensuring that m + has spin + 1

where the ms are all arbitrary analytic functions of the l , , , , except for ml

which are depend only on l, . these two terms are supersymmetric since, although they
are not annihilated by d as the other are, they turn into total derivatives:

which suces.

the quick reader may notice that the (d . . .)m-type terms in (3.9b, c) may be
rewritten as d-terms (since (d)m = d(m), etc.), and could argue for their
discarding here on the grounds that they are eectively included in (3.5). this would
however induce a serious omission. rather than advance a general and possibly obtuse

d. supersymmetry transformation is then calculated, up to total derivatives, by acting with the
operator   d + d.

space and is essential in many superstring applications of 2-dimensional (supersymmetric)
eld theories.

[2]  m a

since total derivatives are routinely dropped, this important term would normally be
lost. thus, instead of rewriting the d(. . .)-terms in (3.9) as d-terms and then meticu-
lously salvaging such and similarly interesting terms from the total derivative debris en
route, it would seem preferable to include them manifestly in the lagrangian density via
the terms such as those in (3.9).

notice also that the metric m h

 dened in the rst one of eqs. (3.12) stemms
from a simple choice of m(l , , , ). in the general case, the metric in the kinetic
term (3.13) is then a hermitian and analytic but otherwise unrestricted matrix function of
the bosonic elds l , , x,  and their conjugates.

thus, the (d . . .)m-type terms in (3.9b, c) play a dual role: (1) they modify the
d-terms, and (2) produce topological terms such as (3.15). the remaining eleven terms
in (3.9ae) however cannot be reduced to d-terms and/or total derivatives; they produce
totally new terms for the lagrangian density.

by the same token, the other batch of -terms is obtained from

is the most general set of -terms for the lagrangian density; see also appendix b.

3.5. f-terms

superpotential terms (3.3b) are a familiar type of candidates for the lagrangian density.
for example, any analytic function of only the chiral superelds, s, is itself a chiral
supereld: dw ()=0.

ambidexterous superpotentials
since all the superelds in (2.29a) satisfy the chiral pair of superconstraints (2.1a), any
analytic function of the arguments listed in (2.29a),

is than also chiral. its hermitian conjugate, w , is antichiral. similarly,

w(cid:0), l, r; (d+), . . .(cid:1) ,
(cid:0), r, l; (d+), . . .(cid:1) ,

is than also twisted chiral, and its hermitian conjugate, , is twisted antichiral. again, we
lump l , r into  and l, r into , and write out explicitly the dependence on quartoid
superelds only if this cannot be done, as in specifying the dependence of the coecient
functions in (3.9).

however, a few further restrictions are needed. for the putative lagrangian density

terms

z d2 w + h.c.

and

z d2/  + h.c. ,

(3.17)

to be scalar densities, w and  have to be scalar densities themselves. therefore, each
term in their expansion over the superderivative superelds must have an even number
of superderivatives. finally, to prevent higher derivative and/or negative dimensional
coecient terms, we write w in the following form:

and truncate w> to terms quadratic in superderivatives.

w = w0() + 1

2 w>(cid:0); . . .(cid:1) ,

(3.18a)

 31 

sponding -term (3.16):

now, among all the possible terms with a quadratic superderivative, e.g., the term

r d2 (d+d)w + h.c. can be rewritten, without any loss of generality, as a corre-
z d2 (d+d )w()  dd+(d+d )w()(cid:12)(cid:12) = dd+d+ (d)w ()(cid:12)(cid:12) ,
(3.19)
where we have dropped the total derivative i=| d[(d )w]|. in fact, the corresponding
-term in (3.9b),r d2d(d)m, is more general, as the coecient function m may
depend on l, , , , whereas w depends only on . a similar fate befalls many of
the tentative f-terms, and only the following remain, not being reducible without loss of
generality to any of the terms in (3.5) or (3.16):

2 [d+, d+]d(cid:2)(d )w()(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

 1

w> =(d+a=| )(d=)wa + (d+a=| )(d+m )wam

+ (d=)(dm )wm + (d+m )(dn )wm n ,

(3.18b)

where the ws are arbitrary analytic functions of the  only. the canonical dimensions
of w0() and the coecient functions in w>() are all non-negative: [w0]=1 (mass pa-
rameters) and [w]=0 (dimensionless couplings). the omited higher order superderivative
terms would have had coecient functions with negative dimensions. with the superpo-
tential (3.18),

lw = 1

2z d2 w (; . . .) + h.c. = 1

2 [dd+w (; . . .)](cid:12)(cid:12) + h.c.

is the most general superpotential lagrangian density.
in the absence of unidexterous
superelds, lw reduces to the well-known superpotential terms involving only the holo-
morphic function w0() in (3.18.)

where

> =(d+a=| )(d=)a + (d+a)(d+

b=| )ab

+ (da)(d=)a + (d+a)(db)ab ,

where the s are arbitrary analytic functions of the  only. the canonical dimensions of
0() and the coecient functions in >() are all non-negative: [0]=1 (mass parame-
ters) and []=0 (dimensionless couplings).

 32 

similarly,

l = 1

2z d2/ (; . . .) + h.c. = 1

is the most general twisted superpotential lagrangian density, with the twisted superpo-
tential being

unidexterous superpotentials

by contrast, no (higher) superderivative of either of , , ,  satises the supercon-
straints (2.1e, f ). therefore, ll (lr), the lefton (righton) analogue of lw and l, is
constructed entirely from lefton (righton) superelds. using the list (2.29e), we nd that

ll = 1

2z d2 = n =|(cid:0); . . .(cid:1) + h.c.
4(cid:2)[d+, d+]n =| (; . . .)(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:12) + h.c.

is the lefton superpotential term for the lagrangian density. for this to be a scalar
density, the function n =| must transform as a vector of spin +1, and so must depend on
the =| s (this is the reason for their introduction). restricting again to terms in which the
coecient functions have non-negative dimensions, we nd (omitting indices for brevity):

3.6. -terms

(3.24b)

finally, we come to the terms with the simplest , -dependence. as listed in (2.29g),
l , (d+) and (d+d+) satisfy the chiral lefton pair of superconstraints (2.3a), i.e., they
depend only on . thus

ll =z d+(l ; d+; d+d+) + h.c.

(3.27)

is a hermitian supersymmetric lagrangian density term, given any analytic spin + 1
tion +(l ; d+; d+d+) and its hermitian conjugate 9).

2 func-

the superelds l , d+ and d+d+, as dened above (2.3) and (2.1), contain no
positive spin component elds, which is why the =| have been introduced. for a la-
grangian density without higher derivative and negative dimensional coecient functions,
we truncate the expansion of + in d+ and d+d+, and obtain the list:

1

(d+a=| )a ,

4 (d+a=| )(d+d+

b=| )(d+c)abc , (3.28)
where the ja, ab and abcs are arbitrary analytic functions of only the l . however, all
of these turn out to be special cases of various terms from (3.24a). for example,

4 (d+a=| )(d+

b=| )ab , + 1

(d+a=| )a

(3.29)

may be rewritten unambiguously (up to total derivatives) and without any loss of gener-
ality, as a unidexterous f-term:

(3.30)
the same of course holds for its conjugate, and their parity mirrors, (r; d; dd)
and its conjugate.

2(cid:2)d+(d+a=| )a(l)(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:12) + h.c. = 1

4(cid:2)[d+, d+]a=| a(l)(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:12) + h.c.

9) recall that the unidexterous superelds,  and , while in general complex, may be chosen

to be real or imaginary.

 34 

note that it was necessary to introduce the superelds =| and = for there to be any
unidexterous f-terms, (3.23) and (3.26). the readers interested only in the ambidextrous
haploid superelds (2.1ad) need not concern themselves with (3.23) and (3.26), and the
appropriate terms from the rest of (3.3).

3.7. physical degrees of freedom

note that each term in eqs. (3.5), (3.16), (3.20), (3.21), (3.23) and (3.26) leads to a sepa-
rately supersymmetric term in the lagrangian density (3.3). the plentiful of these expres-
sions, if not already (3.3) and (3.4), make it clear that 2-dimensional (2,2)-supersymmetric
models are far more diverse than n =1 supersymmetric models in 4-dimensional spacetime.

interdependent kinetic terms
in models in higher dimensional spacetimes, the kinetic terms come entirely from the
d-terms (3.5). in 2-dimensional spacetime, however, we nd kinetic terms in all other
contributions to the lagrangian density, lw in (3.20), l in (3.21), ll in (3.23), lr
in (3.26) and lq in (3.16). all of these then modify the standard (d-term) kinetic terms.
in particular and as discussed already in  3.4, the -terms (3.4f, g), and in fact all the
nine terms in the lagrangian density (3.4), contain terms that directly modify the kinetic
terms for the components of the various superelds. this type of mechanism was used in
ref. [15] to prove that kinetic terms in fact can be invariant under renormalization ow;
indeed, the kinetic terms emerging from all except ld in (3.4h) are protected by the usual
nonrenormalization theorems (see, e.g., p.358 of ref. [6] for an important caveat).

a minor comment may not be out of place here. educated on simple models with

at kinetic terms such as r d4   ()( ), one is easy to skim over terms like
(=| a)(=r) as being trivial. indeed, the simple d-termr d4 

[(=| )  2il=| ][(=r)  2ir=]

= (=| )(=r)  4l=| r=  2i(=| )r=  2il=| (=r) ,
= =| (=r)  4l=| r=  2i=| (r=)  2i=(l=| r) ,

(3.31)

turns into a total derivative, except for the non-derivative l=| r= term. this clearly carries

no dynamics for the spin-0 elds  and r. however, considerr d2(d+a)(d)ma(),

which is a special case of the third term in (3.9b). upon fermionic integration, we obtain
the kinetic terms:

4 [(=| a)  2ila
 1

=| ][(=r)  2ir

=]ma() .

(3.32)

these denitely do not turn into total derivatives, as long as the metric ma() is not
constant; in fact, these provide non-trivial -dependent kinetic (mixing) terms for the
oppositely handed bosons a and r.

auxiliary elds and (non)linearity
after having expanded the lagrangian density into component elds by means of fermionic
integration, we notice that a number of elds have algebraic equations of motion. by

 35 

contrast, elds with dierential equations of motion are called physical. for example,
consider using the (d)m by itself for a lagrangian:

the full component expansion is given in appendix b.2. from there, we nd

l1 = 1

8 [d+, d+]d(d )m(cid:12)(cid:12) + h.c.

(3.33)

(3.34)

0 =

l1
f  = f (m, + m ,) + 

(

+m ,   + 
l+m ,  + 

 

( 

a
+m ,a) ,

+m, + a

+m,a)

and the conjugate relation by varying with respect to f . these are the equations of
motion for f  and f  . wherever the hermitian matrix (m, + m ,) is invertible, the
equations of motion can be solved for all the f s, and these solutions may be substituted
back into the lagrangian density. writing m  for the matrix inverse of (m, + m , ),
wed have

+m,a)(cid:3) , (3.35)

f  = m (cid:2)
( 


+m ,   + 
l+m , + 

a

+m ,a)  

(

+m, + a

and a similar expression for  . clearly, this is nonlinear in the elds: roughly, f is
quadratic in the fermions, but the details depend on the choice of the lagrangian density.
its substitution back in the lagrangian density produces additional cubic and quartic
terms, and so aects the interactions between the various elds.

the relation (3.35) also enters in another important place. prior to elimination of the

f s, the supersymmetry transformation of  is

 = 12

d(q + q)| = 

2+f + . . .

(3.36)

which is linear in the elds (including the omitted terms). after substituting (3.35), this
transformation rule becomes nonlinear in elds, the details of this nonlinearity depending
on the choice of the lagrangian density. we will refer to these two incarnations of the
supersymmetry transformation rules as linear and nonlinear.

it is therefore logically backward to postulate a (nonlinear) set of supersymmetry
transformations involving only physical elds, and then seek an invariant lagrangian den-
sity. although the linear supersymmetry transformation rules for a supereld only depend
on its denition, i.e., which superconstraints it might satisfy, the nonlinear transforma-
tion rules depend on the choice of the lagrangian density through the equations of motion
for the auxiliary elds.
in particular, modications of the lagrangian density (such as
through varying moduli) also modify the non-linear supersymmetry transformation rules.
in contradistinction, the linear transformation rules, with the auxiliary elds uneliminated,
remain unchanged 10), determined entirely by the nature of the supereld itself.

10) may the erudite reader forgive this decidedly un-english but accurate agglutination.

 36 

4. explicit constraining

the lagrangian density (3.3) has been obtained as a sum of berezin integrals over suitable
subsets of the fermionic coordinates. the superderivative superconstraints (2.1) and (2.3)
(and easily also (2.19), should one desire) were implicitly and automatically used in the
process.

of course, the reader may instead wish to include such (super)constraints explicitly.
to that end, and as disclaimed above, here we examine some simple lagrangians which
enable an explicit inclusion of (super)constraints, and so a more standard treatment of
the unidexterous superelds. the present treatment, while inspired by that of ref. [8], is
hopefully a self-sucient introduction to the topic.

4.1. chiral bosons

one standard lagrangian density for a chiral boson is [7]:

lcb = (=| )(=) + z=
=|

(=)2 .

(4.1)

the inclusion of the constraint through a linear term, z=(=) would have left the dynam-
ical degrees of freedom unhalved. although (=) is gauged away, besides (=| ) we also

end up with ez=(=| ), where ez= def= (z=+=| ), at least classically [16,17]. note that upon

imposing the constraint, = = 0, the physical eld f (=| ) and the lagrange multiplier,
z=
, drop out of the lagrangian density (4.1), indicating that this lagrangian density
=|
is invariant under a gauge symmetry. a straightforward calculation veries that (4.1)
transforms into a total derivative under the siegel symmetry transformation:

s = =(=) ,
=| = (=| =)  (==)z=

sz=

=| + =(=z=

=| ) .

(4.2)

the lagrangian density (4.1) is also invariant with respect to a global inhomogeneous
(axial) symmetry:

 =  ,

z=

=| = 0 ,

 = const ,

(4.3)

which allows the interpretation of  as a self-dual gauge scalar. (self-duality here means
that = = (ij

3 ij )j = 0, where i, j = 0, 1and 01 = 1.)

the following two quite obvious observations will guide the construction of the (2,2)-

supersymmetric version:

1. the second term enforces the constraint(s) via the lagrange multiplier;

2. the remaining part of the lagrangian (here, the rst term) pertains to the uncon-

strained eld.

these two features will then be required of the (2,2)-supersymmetric version.

 37 

4.2. chiral lefton

consider a simple model, with one chiral supereld, , governed by the following simple
lagrangian density:

lcl = 1

4z d4 h + 1

2 z =|d|2i .

variation with respect to the lagrange multiplier (general) supereld, z =
, then produces
=|
the quadratic superconstraint, |d|2=0, which restricts the chiral supereld into a chiral
lefton supereld (2.3a). this one time we did include a term which ultimately leads to
higher derivatives in the lagrangian density. dening the components of z = as:

this further simplies the last shown constraint, so that variation with respect to z=
imposes the constraint |=+|2 = 0 (so that =+ = 0). all the sixteen component elds
of z = drop out of the lagrangian upon enforcing these constraints, indicating the presence
of a generalization of the siegel symmetry (4.2). the net eect of the superconstraint term

f = 0 ;

=+ = 0 ;

(4.7b)

the rst two of these, eqs. (4.7a), halve the number of component elds in the chiral
supereld (2.1a) to those of the chiral lefton (2.3a); the second two, eqs. (4.7b), ensure
that the remaining component elds are left-movers. this completes the (initial, primary)
constraining of the chiral supereld to a lefton chiral; the other quartoid elds (2.3) can
be treated in the same fashion, mutatis mutandis. furthermore, a similar treatment of
the unidexterous haploid superelds (2.1e, f) seems equally straightforward, albeit rather
more beset with technical detail.

the choice (4.4) is not necessarily the most convenient. the simple alternative

which disappear from the action upon enforcing the constraints.

variation with respect to z= annihilates the fermions, , . thereupon, variation with
sets = = 0 = = . the auxiliary component eld f and the fermions
respect to z=

+, + appear only in the expansion of the rst (kinetic) term. it is then their equation
of motion that sets f = 0 = f and =+ = 0 = = +. thus, we are again left with the
component elds of a (quartoid) chiral lefton supereld, and the sixteen components elds
of z=
=|
so, whereas the superconstraint term in (4.4) by itself reduces the chiral supereld to
a chiral lefton and annihilates the kinetic term in the process, the superconstraint term
in (4.8) does only half of that, the rest of the constraining is eected by the equations
of motion, derived from the kinetic term in (4.8). having demonstrated these two possi-
bilities, we leave the application- and taste-dependent choice between these (and possibly
other) alternatives to the reader.

4.3. the general model

the skeptical reader might inquire as to the relevancy of the above simple model (4.4) to
the vastly more complicated lagrangian density (3.3), which are quite freely interspersed
with the sundry unidexterous haploid and quartoid superelds. to that end, note the
following simple facts about this lagrangian density:

 39 

1. terms that would involve any of the constraints (4.7) are implicitly projected out of
the lagrangian density (3.3), during the fermionic integrationby its very denition.

2. the lagrangian density (3.3) does not include any of the lagrange multiplier super-

elds enforcing the superconstraints (2.1) and (2.3), because of item 1.

3. the siegel transformations (4.2) turn unidexterous eld(s) into a multiple of the
unidexterity superconstraint. that is, the (unidexterity) superconstraints are the
generators of the siegel symmetry.

the lagrangian density (3.3), being implicitly restricted to the constrained (super)eld
space, is then trivially an invariant of the siegel symmetry. so, at least at the classical
level, there should be no obstacle to using the unidexterous superelds in all the ways they
appear herein.

one could instead relax the unidexterity superconstraints (2.1e, f ) on the s and s,
and impose these superconstraints explicitly through adding suitable lagrangian multiplier
terms to (a suitable subset of) the lagrangian density (3.3). finding thereupon a suitable
generalization of the siegel symmetry for this modied lagrangian density, should guaran-
tee a well-dened interactive quantum theory. this, or any other of the many approaches
to constrained quantization, is however beyond our present scope. the reader weary of
the unidexterous quantization issues may of course safely use the lagrangian density (3.3)
with the unidexterous superelds carefully extracted.

on the other hand, the axial symmetry analogue of (4.3) for each of the unidexter-
ous superelds is explicitly broken by each term where an inhomogeneously transform-
ing component eld of a unidexterous supereld appears without a spacetime derivative
acting on it. many, however, do not break the axial symmetries: consider the term

r d2(d+a)(d)ma(), obtained as a special case from (3.9b), which upon fermionic

integration yields

4 [(=| a)  2ila
=| ][(=r)  2ir
 1
+(cid:8)f a

a
=| ]

 + i

2 

ma, ()

+a

+


+[(=r)  2ir

(4.11)

=](cid:9)ma,() .

this involves a and r, the lowest component elds of the lefton and righton superelds,
only through their spacetime derivatives. consequently, it is invariant under the two
inhomogeneous axial transformations: a = a (where =| a=0), and r =  (where
==0), with respect to which all other elds are held inert.

the inquisitive reader is invited to sift through the multitude of individually su-
persymmetric parts of the lagrangian density (3.3) and identify all the terms with such
property, should this be a requirement of a desired application.

finally, the constraining lagrangian density (4.4) could serve as a prototype of an
excplicit constraining of the various constrained superields [7]. for example, given an
unconstrained complex (2,2)-supereld, , and two unconstrained lagrange multiplier
superelds, z = and z =| , the lagrangian term

1

8z d4 (cid:2)z =(d)(d) + z =| (d+)(d+)(cid:3) ,

 40 

(4.12)

will constrain  into a chiral supereld. again, the maintenance of the generalization
of the siegel symmetry o the constrained supereld subspace and quantum issues are
beyond our present scope.

5. wave-function(al)s and geometry

the hilbert space of supersymmetric eld theories is in many regards much simpler than
the one in models without supersymmetry [18,19,20,21,22,23]. although many of the
known results have been derived for 2-dimensional supersymmetric eld theories, the lack
of present generality warrants another look at these issues.

5.1. vacua and wave-function(al)s

the wave-function(al)s in supersymmetric theories are functions of the superelds and so
admit a formal expansion in the fermionic elds. local such wave function(al)s (in the
2-dimensional spacetime sense) will then have a terminating taylor series owing to the
nite number of fermionic elds and their anticommutivity, and so must be multinomials
in fermionic elds.

a hallmark of fermionic elds is the fact that their kinetic terms are rst order in
time derivatives, so half the fermionic elds turn out to be conjugate momenta to the
other half. the exact pairing of course depends on the exact choice of the lagrangian
density (3.3). on the other hand, the identication of the canonical coordinate and
the canonical momentum within any one canonically conjugate pair of fermion elds is
completely arbitrary.

in a second-quantized theory, we dene a (dirac) vacuum state, |0i, which is annihi-
lated by precisely one half of the fermionic elds. except, of course, the choice of precisely
which half will annihilate |0i remains free. as well known, eqs. (1.2) imply

and so

(cid:8) q , q(cid:9) +(cid:8) q+ , q+(cid:9) = 4h ,
4h{q, q}i + 1
4(cid:2)|q|2 + |q|2 + |q+|2 + |q+|2(cid:3)  0 ,

4h{d+, d+}i

hhi = 1
= 1

(5.1)

(5.2)

the equality reached precisely for supersymmetric states, i.e., those annihilated by all four
supercharges. that is, in supersymmetric models, the hamiltonian is positive denite, and
its global minima (of zero energy, hence the true vacua) are the supersymmetric states.

it is then the supersymmetric states, the true vacua, that we seek in a supersymmetric
model, so as to erect the full hilbert space by acting on these vacua with creation operators.
in turn, the vacua, i.e., supersymmetric states are easily constructed from the vacua |0i.

 41 

single species models
even if considering just a single species of fermionic elds, such as 
 which appear in
chiral superelds and their conjugates (as used in wess-zumino model), respectively, one
easily nds six logically possible choices of such a |0i:

,  

(c, c) vacuum :

(a, a) vacuum :

(a, c) vacuum :

(c, a) vacuum :

left vacuum :

right vacuum :


+ |0i(c,c) = 0 = 
+ |0i(a,a) = 0 =  
 
 
+ |0i(a,c) = 0 = 
+ |0i(c,a) = 0 =  

= 0 =  

 |0il

+ |0ir

 |0i(c,c) ;
 |0i(a,a) ;
 |0i(a,c) ;
 |0i(c,a) ;
 |0il
+ |0ir

= 0 =  

.

.

(5.3a)

(5.3b)

(5.3c)

(5.3d)

(5.3e)

(5.3f)

we have assumed here that a degree of uniformity is to be required of the chiral su-
perelds and their conjugates, so that all (un)conjugate fermions appear in the dening
equations (5.3) on the same footing. in particular, the denitions (5.3) are invariant with
respect to any invertible linear transformation among the chiral superelds  (which
commutes with the lorentz symmetry, and so preserves spin), accompanied by the conju-
gate transformation among their antichiral conjugates, . clearly, if (global) invariance
is to be required only with respect to a subset of these transformations, several additional
choices of |0i will be possible.

for any one choice of |0i, the half of the fermionic elds which do not annihilate
|0i then act as creation operators, and states are constructed as multinomials in these
creation fermions, acting on |0i. naturally, these wave function(al)s (states) built upon
these vacua will be called by the same names: that is, a (c, c) state will be built from a
(c, c) vacuum, |0i(c,c), an (a, c) state from |0i(a,c), and so on.

now, the kinetic term for the fermions is typically something like

l(f )

+(= 

kin. = ig(cid:2)
= ig(cid:0)

)(cid:3) ,
+) + 
(=|  
 
 
+ + 
  

def= 0 is the time-derivative of , 
def= 1 its space-derivative, and
where 
g is the metric determined by the choice of the lagrangian density (3.3). therefore,
i

 
+ + 


def= ig  

(cid:1) ,

(5.4)

 

+

+

 is the canonical conjugate of 
(cid:8) i , 
i.e. (cid:8)  

(cid:9) = i

, so that
 , 

 ,

(cid:9) = g .

(5.5)

notice now that the fth and sixth logical possibilities, tentatively called the left
and right vacua in fact must vanish, since the two conditions (5.3e) may be combined to
yield

0 = (cid:8) 

 ,  

(cid:9)|0il

 42 

= ig |0il

,

(5.6)

whereupon |0il  0 is inevitable. so, unlike (2,2)-superelds in 2-dimensional spacetime,
there are only four types (two conjugate pairs) of (2,2)-vacua  for a single species of
fermions.

in a -model, the bosonic coordinates ,  are identied as target space coordinate-
valued world-sheet scalars. that is, they map the world-sheet (domain) into x (the target
space). in a fourier expansion (locally in x), the 0-wavevector modes may be identied
with local coordinates z, z in x. then, half of the fermions ,  can be identied with
the dierentials dz, dz, and the other half with the partials , . we adopt:

g 

 7  ,

+ 7 dz ,
that the anticommutivity of 
+ and nb matches the anticommutivity of dz, dz, stan-
dard in dierential geometry. however, whereas the momenta g 
+ also
anticommute, the basis elements of the tangent bundle,  and  commute. neverthe-
less, the above identication has proven of great use in the analysis of the geometry of
supersymmetric eld theory models.

 
 7 dz  ,
+ 7  ,

 and g

(5.7)

with the identications (5.7), the (c, c) wave function

corresponds to the ptx -valued q-form

    q

similarly, the (a, c) wave function

|p, q; i(a,c) = 1p 1q (, )1

+   p

+  1

    q

 |0i(a,c)

corresponds to the pt x -valued q-form

1p 1q (, )dz1  dzpdz 1  dz q .

(5.8)

(5.9)

(5.10)

(5.11)

supersymmetric states
states which are invariant with respect to supersymmetry transformations are of very
special interest [18]; we recall a few important facts here. representing a supersymmetric
state, let |i stand for a wave-function annihilated by all supercharges. then

implying

(cid:8) q , q(cid:9)|i = 0  (h  p) |i = 0 ,

p|i = 0 = h |i .

that is, translationally invariant states of zero energy are supersymmetric, and vice versa.
now, the precise form of h, p, q and q (as operators on the eld space) depends
on the precise choice of the lagrangian density (3.3). restricting to translationally in-
variant (world-sheet space-independent) states, is in many ways equivalent to completely
disregarding the spatial extension of the world-sheet, and reducing from the 2-dimensional

 43 

(supersymmetric) eld theory to (supersymmetric) quantum mechanics. in practice, this
allows us to ignore the momentum density p and all the terms which involve world-sheet
spatial derivatives; h correspondingly simplies to the fokker-planck type hamiltonian.
for the case of wess-zumino models (those containing only n chiral superelds and their
conjugates), these operators have been identied many years ago [20,21].

for the more general case involving more than just one species of superelds (2.1),

(2.3), (2.19), etc., this remains unexplored, albeit straightforward.

three remarks

before we turn to a cursory look at multiple-species models, three general remarks are
in order. these are based on the fact that the adjoint pair of (dolbeault) dierential

operators  def= dz and *, with the only non-zero anticommutation relation { , *} =
 , where   is the -laplacian. indeed, the correspondence between supersymmetric
and cohomology theories, rst noted in ref. [18], stemms from the (formal) isomorphism
between these and the pair of anticommuting dierential operators d, d with the only
non-zero anticommutation relation (1.6).

1. corresponding to the two pairs , *, and , * in dierential geometry, we have
q, q and q+, q+. then, the supersymmetric analogue of complex conjugation
in dierential geometry is not hermitian conjugation but parity, p . of course, upon
euclideanization, parity does act as complex conjugation on the (bosonic body of the)
world-sheet riemann surface. on the other hand, the dierential-geometric analogue
of hermitian conjugation in supersymmetric models is the formal exchange   *,
not complex conjugation.

2. the analogue of   is 2(h + p), i.e., =| ; the analogue of  2(h  p), i.e., =.
when complex conjugation is a symmetry of the target space (as it happens, but
not exclusively, on kahler manifolds),   = . the analogous situation with the
supersymmetry algebra and its representations happens when 2(h + p) = 2(h  p):
in the sector of zero-momenum states, where p|i = 0. equivalently, this implies
=| = =, which holds on 1-independent functions, i.e., upon dimensional reduction
to (supersymmetric) quantum mechanics.

3. being annihilated by both d+ and d+, the righton superelds,  (2.1f ), are iso-
morphic to -closed and co-closed forms, that is, to -harmonic forms. similarly, the
lefton superelds,  (2.1f ), are isomorphic to -closed and co-closed forms, that is,
to -harmonic forms. this correspondence has, to the best of my knowledge, not been
observed before and its utility remains unexplored.

several species models

with more types of superelds, and so more species of fermions, the number of dierent
types (sectors) of vacua and wave-function(al)s increases very quickly.

even if restricting to just the minimal haploid superelds, there are many more


, 
+ from twisted-
+ (and, if complex, their conjugates) from lefton superelds

 from (anti)chiral superelds, 
+, a

species of fermions: 
,  
(anti)chiral superelds, a

, 

+ and 

 44 

, i

and i
 (and, if complex, their conjugates) from righton superelds. half of these are
canonically conjugate variables to the other half (the precise pairing depending on the
precise choice of the lagrangian density), so we in general expect six types of fermionic
creation operators, not just two as above. clearly, there will also be many more choices
of |0i.

consider a simple toy example with a single minimal haploid supereld of each

kind (2.1) and the lagrangian density

ltoy = 1

+ 1

4z d4 (  )
4hz d ==| (d+d+=| ) + h.c.i ,
4hz d =| =(dd=) + h.c.i ,

+ 1

(5.12a)

(5.12b)

(5.12c)

where, for simplicity, we require =| , = to be real. then, the rst two terms produce
the standard kinetic terms for the scalar elds  and x, their fermionic superpartners, 
and , +, respectively, the auxiliary elds f, x, and their hermitian conjugates. the
scalars and have their usual canonically conjugate momenta, and , + and , + are
canonically conjugate pairs.

we then focus on the second part (5.12b), which produces (up to total derivatives):

the equations of motion for l=|

l=|

=| =|+ = 0 ,

, =|+ and =|+, respectively, set:

=| =|+ = 0 .

(5.13)

(5.14)

upon substituting the rst of these back into the lagrangian density, both l=|
and =|
=|
disappear from it, indicating a gauge symmetry. as for the fermions, on shell, =|+, =|+ =
const. (recall that ==| = 0.)

more importantly, however, the boson =| has a well-dened canonically conjugate (l=|
-
=|
dependent) momentum, and =|+ and =|+ are canonically conjugate to each other. similarly,
the last part (5.12c) dictates that =

 are canonically conjugate to each other.

 and =

thus, we can dene sixty-four/ dierent (dirac) vacua |0i, annihilated by a choice of

six fermions:

(cid:26) (cid:27),(cid:26) +

+(cid:27),(cid:26) (cid:27),(cid:26) +

+(cid:27),(cid:26) =|+

(cid:27) ,
=|+(cid:27),(cid:26) =


=

(5.15)

where each braced pair indicates a free choice. building upon these vacua, there are sixty-
four (super)sectors of the hilbert spacegeneralizing the (c, c), (a, c), (c, a) and (a, a)
sectors familiar from landau-ginzburg orbifolds, but present in any (2,2)-supersymmetric
theory.

 45 

5.2. haploid correlation functions

in a model with the lagrangian density (3.3), it is easy to dene correlation functions for
the various terms in (3.3). for example, let us denote by iw the ith term that can be
added to the superpotential w in (3.3b). this means that each iw is a chiral supereld,
and so satises eqs. (2.1a). then, the correlation function

h0| 1w    nw |0i

(5.16)

is also called chiral, since the product 1w  nw is chiral. similarly, a twisted-chiral
correlation function is the correlation function of a (product of) twisted-chiral object(s), a
lefton correlation function of a (product of) lefton object(s), etc.

the study of correlation functions simplies on noting that in theories with unbroken
supersymmetry, the vacua must be invariant under supersymmetry, and so annihilated
by the supercharges q, q. this induces a number of topological results [22,23,24],
which will herein be refered to as rigidity, not unrelated to the mathematically standard
notion of rigidity, and to avoid confusion with the mathematically standard notion of
topological.

the rigidity results of the work on chiral correlation functions in wess-zumino mod-
els [25,26,22,23] has a direct analogue for correlation functions of ambixterous haploid
(and all quartoid) supereld operators. given any two chiral superelds, (=|1 , =
1 ) and
(=|2 , =
for i = 1, 2,
the basic result is as follows:

2 ), which depend on two dierent points on the world-sheet, =|i , =

i



=

1 h0|12|0i = 1
= 1

2ih0|{q, (q1)}2|0i
(q1)2 |0i + 1

2i h0| q

since [q, i] = 0, and

=|1

| {z }=0
h0|12|0i = 1

2i h0| (q1)2 q |0i

| {z }=0

2ih0|{q+, (q+1)}2|0i = 0 ,

= 0 ,

(5.17a)

in a similar fashion. the same, upon qq, is of course true for h0|12|0i.

by the same token,



1 h0|12|0i = 1
h0|12|0i = 1

=


=|1

2ih0|{q, (q1)}2|0i = 0 ,

2ih0|{q+, (q+1)}2|0i = 0 ,

and the same for h0|12|0i. the same rigidity will hold for the quartoid superelds (2.3),
as they all satisfy the superconstraints of some ambidexterous haploid supereld. this can
be remembered easily by regarding l and r as two halves of , and l and r as two
halves of .

 46 

(5.17b)

(5.17c)

(5.17d)

the situation is quite dierent for the unidexterous elds:



1 h0|12|0i = 1

=

2ih0|{q, (q1

)}2|0i = 0 ,

| {z }=0


=|1

h0|12|0i = 1

2ih0|{q+, (q+1)}2|0i = 1

2i h0| (q1)(q2) |0i 6= 0 .

holds again, but now

similarly,



1 h0|12|0i = 1
h0|12|0i = 1

=


=|1

2ih0|{q, (q1)}2|0i 6= 0 ,

2ih0|{q+, (q+1)}2|0i = 0 .

(5.17b)

(5.17f)

(5.17h)

(5.17h)

that is:

1. corellation functions of (products of) any one type of ambidexterous haploid super-
elds (2.1ad) (and any quartoid superelds (2.3) that obey the same superconstraint)
are independent of the superelds positions on the world-sheet.

2. corellation functions of (products of) unidexterous haploid superelds (2.1e, f) are
correspondingly unidexterous functions of the superelds positions on the world-sheet.

it should be clear that only the constrained superelds dened by the simple supercon-
straints (2.1) and (2.3), which are linear in both superderivatives and superelds, posess
this remarkable property of rigidity.

5.3. target space geometry

the eld (target) space for our model is spanned by the physical component elds in
the collection of superelds , , , , , . the entire lagrangian density (3.3) depends
on a grand total of 3 rank-0, 24 rank-1, 32 rank-2, 12 rank-3 and 6 rank-4 (tensor-like)
coecient functions (and their complex conjugates) dened in (3.18), (3.22), (3.24), (3.9)
and (3.5). even if the unidexterous superelds, , , l, r, l, r and the non-minnimal
superelds, , , , , were to be dropped, the lagrangian density depends on 3 rank-0
and 4 rank-1 coecient functions, dened in (3.18), (3.22), (3.9) and (3.5):

k(, , x, x) , w () , (x) ,

m(, x) , m (, x) , fm(, x) , fm(, x) ,

and the conjugates of all but k, which is real. each term from eqs. (3.18), (3.22), (3.9)
and (3.5) featuring one of these functions produces, upon the appropriate fermionc integra-
tion, a separately and manifestly supersymmetric term in the lagrangian (3.3). therefore,
supersymmetry imposes no further condition on the coecient functions (5.18) and their
complement, as dened in (3.18), (3.22), (3.9) and (3.5).

(5.18)

 47 

recall that the last four displayed coecient functions in (5.18) contribute both to a
variation in the d-term (i.e., a change of k) and a topological term such as (3.15). four
other terms,

(5.19)

1

and

8 [d+, d+]d(cid:2)(d)ml
8 [d, d]d+(cid:2)(d+)fmr

 + (d)ml

 + (d+

(cid:3) + h.c.
)fmr

vanish on retaining only the chiral and twisted-chiral superelds: the coecient functions
ml , mr become constants, whereupon the repeated superderivative annihilates the term.
clearly, these rank-0. . .4, coecient functions are rank-0. . .4 tensor-like objects over
the eld space. however, it must be emphasized that these need not be global tensors
of such rank! consider for example the term (d)m(l , , , ) from eq. (3.9b).
the (co)vector m need not be a global (co)vector eld over the space coordinatized by
the (lowest components of) , . in particular, as used in eq. (3.11) and below, the
(co)vector m may well be a contraction

m + m + ama + . . .

(5.20)

thus, the fact that in some application, the space coordinatized by the (lowest components
of) ,  does not admit a global 1-form md does not preclude the inclusion in the
lagrangian density of the rst -term in eq. (3.9b).

furthermore, the coecient functions in (3.18), (3.22), (3.9) and (3.5) all admit some
degree of arbitrariness, generalizing the well-known kahler symmetry, k  k + f () +
f (), where f ()is an arbitrary function of the chiral superelds, and f its conjugate. in
point of fact, the function k in (3.5) is dened only up to the very general reparametriza-
tion:

k(, , , . . .)  k + f() + f(+) + f() + f(+) ,

(5.21)

where

df() = 0 = d+f(+) , d

(5.22)
that is, f() and f() are arbitrary functions of any of the (superderivative) superelds
annihilated by any one of the superderivatives; see eqs. (2.30.) for the other coecient
functions, the reparametrizing functions (such as the f above) must be annihilated by at
least one more superderivative than the coecient function that they reparametrize. for
example, the superpotential obeys

f() = 0 = d+ f(+) .

w  w + gl + gr ,

(5.23)

where gl , gr are a chiral lefton and a chiral righton function. clearly, gl , gr are nonzero
only in models that involve chiral leftons and chiral rightons.

it is then patently clear that the geometry of the eld (target) space of general (2,2)-
supersymmetric models is considerably more general than just kahler manifolds with an
assortiment of (holomorphic) vector bundles (or even sheaves). as it was known since
ref. [1], even a model depending on just the last one of the eleven functions (5.18) provides
more general geometries, further augmented by the two superpotentials, w () and ().

 48 

the continued extension of the geometrical structure relying on the inclusion of rank-
2 coecient functions w  and  was noted in ref. [4]. these appear through the
f-terms

1

2z d2/ (d+)(d )() ,

(5.24)

1

2z d2 (d+)(d

)w () ,

and

which are in fact special cases of the rst two -terms (3.9b). to the best of my knowl-
edge, this is the rst time the four 1-forms in (5.18) have made their public appearance.
of course, if one insists on restricting to only chiral, twisted-chiral superelds and their
conjugates, the seven objects (5.18) admittedly exhausts the list (subject to our general
restrictions), with the latter four merely modifying the d-terms and contributing topo-
logical terms such as (3.15).

note that, except for k which is real, all the coecient functions are analytic of their
arguments, and so holomorphic functions of their complex arguments. the lagrangian

terms in which they appear are not r d4-integrated terms, whence they fall under the

scope of the non-renormalization theorems [5,6]. more precisely, their contribution to the
d-terms is subject to renormalization, but the complement of these contributions is not.
that is, the lagrangian terms involving all but the rst of the functions (5.18) (and all
those omitted in (5.18)!) are expected to provide marginal operators (and so deformations)
in a quantum theory.

6. summary, outlook and conclusions

in an attempt to provide a comprehensive but comprehensible intrinsic study of (2,2)-
supersymmetric models in 2-dimensional spacetime, we purposefully avoid donstructions
based on dimensional reduction from 4-dimensions.

a self-contained discussion of types of constrained superelds was given in  2. these
include haploid (quartoid ) superelds, which depend on a half (quarter) of the fermionic
coordinates. the minimal haploid superelds are dened by a simple pair of rst order
superconstraints (2.1), while their non-minimal brethern are dened by one simple second
order superconstraint (2.19). quartoid superelds are dened by a simple triplet of rst
order superconstraints (2.3). all quartoid superelds (2.3), and two of six minimal haploid
superelds, those dened in (2.1e, f), are unidexterous (depend only on one world-sheet
light-cone coordinate). numerous other types of constrained superelds are discussed,
albeit not as systematically, in  2.6.

the possible choices for a lagrangian density for the haploid and quartoid superelds
are discussed in  3. the otherwise innite number of choices is curbed by demanding that
the resulting equations of motion contain no higher than second derivatives on bosons,
and no higher than rst derivatives on fermions, and that no coecient function turns out
to have negative canonical dimension. this leads to the general form of the lagrangian
density (3.4), with terms supplied in (3.5), (3.9), (3.18), (3.22) and (3.24). the exhaus-
tive construction and verication of supersymmetry of these lagrangian density terms
was facilitated by creating lists of (superderivative) superelds which are annihilated by

 49 

some subset of the four superderivatives (2.29) and (2.30).  4 discusses some issues of
quantization of constrained superelds.

upon choosing a preferred lagrangian density, one can turn to a study of the hilbert
space, the structure of the supersymmetric wave-functions, correlation functions, and the
relations to the geometry of the target space. this is illustrated in  5, where some of the
basic results are recalled and generalized.

6.1. further topics

en route, a nuber of issues have been deferred to a later study, and we recall these, for the
sake of the reader.

transformations and dualities
in  1.3, the group of discrete transformations of the soul of the (2,2)-superspace (gener-
ated by the four fermionic coordinates) has been studied. two of these transformations
have been identied as the root of two of the dualities in string theory:

1. left-handed conjugation, c+, as being the root of mirror symmetry, and
2. unconjugate parity, p, as being the root of the type iiatype iib duality [14].
rather conspicuously, mirror symmetry is an actual symmetry of the total hilbert space,
while the type iiatype iib duality is not. at the same time, c+ commutes with
lorentz symmetry while p does not; more importantly, c+ is a symmetry of the su-
persymmetry algebra (1.6), while p is not. it is tempting to conjecture that this latter
property of p makes it the root of a duality between two dierent string theories, rather
than a symmetry of a single (super)string theory, as is the case with c+ and mirror sym-
metry. in any case, these operations are but two elements of a discrete group, denoted in
 1.3 as 2s4. the remaining 45 non-trivial operations may similarly generate additional
duality (triality, and even quadriality) relations among (super)string (and related) the-
ories, and are well worth exploring. in particular, s4 is generated by one more independent
simple swap. this third simple transformation (involution, i.e., self-inverse) should at least
be of interest in (super)string theory. as noted, there is however a continuous group of
transformations, gl(4, c), at least a subgroup of which could provide further insight into
(super)string (and related) dynamics. this too seems to warrant a closer study.

dimensional reduction
supersymmetric quantum mechanics provides the underlying framework for understanding
the general features of any supersymmetric eld theory [18]. the present analysis of (2,2)-
supersymmetric models in 2-dimensional spacetime can of course be dimensionally reduced
to (2,2)-supersymmetric quantum mechanics. since the lorentz symmetry in 2-dimensional
spacetimes is already abelian, it is not clear if any generality would be lost in this way.
that is, it remains unclear whether a similarly intrinsic (ab initio) and comprehensive
study of supersymmetric quantum mechanic would allow for possibilities not obtained
by dimensional reduction from the results presented and indicated herein. the study in
refs. [27] deos seem to suggest this, in fact, 0-fold so.

 50 

on the other hand, with no continuous lorentz symmetry in supersymmetric quantum
mechanics, the notion of chirality is now lost. then, the spin labels ( sub- and super-
scripts) as used in this article simply count the extended supersymmetries. this change
has to be taken into account when translating the present results to various applications
of n4 supersymmetric quantum mechanics.

quantization
some of the issues of quantization of constrained superelds have been mentioned in  4. a
complete and detailed hamiltonian (dirac, brst, etc.) treatment would seem to be well
worth, especially in view of the apparent diculties with unidexterous (super)elds; see
above, and ref. [9] for a recent account and further references. suce it here to note that
both general approaches outlined in  4 have both advantages and drawbacks. while the
use of unconstrained superelds allowes for a more straightforward quantization, it also
requires many more component elds and a complementing set of gauge symmetries (to
gauge away the extra components introduced by passing to unconstrained superelds).

on the other hand, quantization of constrained superelds requires a detailed study of
the full content of the constraints, and a proper enforcement by means of suitable lagrange
multipliers. as the component elds of the lagrange multiplier superelds ultimately must
disappear from the action, the proper siegel (-) symmetry must be identied and ensured.

gauge symmetries
as noted from the outset, gauge symmetry issues (in a comparably comprehensive setting)
are completely ignored herein, and are deferred to a later eort. partial results may be
found in refs. [3,4].

however, quite unrelated to usual gauge symmetries, eqs. (2.22) present a rather pecu-
liar type of inhomogeneous gauge transformations, where the supercoordinates themselves
serve as generators.

these are perhas not unrelated to the relation:

{ : d=0}  {   +  +(1)
where (1)

+ + (2) , (1)

+  (1)

+ + (1)
  (1)

 } ,
 +  +(2) .

(6.1)

here, as throughout the article, the circle atop indicates that the supereld is uncon-
strained. the supeelds (i) may be regarded as ith order gauge parameters. that is,
component elds of the originally unconstrained supereld  are being elliminated by
means of the (1st order) gauge transformation

 =  +(1)

+ + (1)
 .

(6.2a)

this, however, would attempt to gauge away some of the component elds twice (recall the
doubly shaded region in figs. 4 and 6), and so the gauge parameters, (1)
 , are themselves
subject to a (2nd order) gauge transformation,

(1)

 =  +(2) ,

and (1)

+ = (2) ,

(6.2b)

 51 

with respect to which the rst order gauge transformation (6.2a) is invariant. the compo-
nent elds remaining in this sequential double quotient are the same as those in a chiral
supereld. this sequential double quotient representation of the chiral supereld is ob-
viously rather more involved technically. however, it also gives the chiral supereld the
role of a gauge eld (having an inhomogeneous transformation), which is certainly not the
usual case. the non-minimal chiral supereld also admits a similar description:

{ : d+d=0}  {   +   +(1)} ,
which is a simple quotient by the inhomogeneous transformation

 =   +(1) ,

(6.3)

(6.4)

as compared to the sequential double quotient, with respect to the cascading pair of in-
homogeneous transformations (6.2), of the minimal chiral supereld. of course, the
other haploid superelds, minimal and non-minimal, admit similar quotient representa-
tions. quite generally, the constrained and the quotient representations are dual in a
well-dened sense: the former represents the kernel, the latter the cokernel of a mapping.

the utility of this quotient representation as well as the duality between the quotient
and the constrained representations remains unclear, and will require a study in its own
right.
it is however clear that it will be linked to the possible roles of the peculiar
inhomogeneous transformations, such as (2.22), (6.2) and (6.4). note also that the quotient
description has a direct implication in a brst descrition: eq. (6.4) induces a single set
of ghost superelds, whereas eqs. (6.2a, b) induce a set of ghost superelds, and a set of
ghost-for-ghost superelds, respectively.

other superconstraints
finally, as shown in  2.6, the simple superconstraints (2.1), (2.3) and (2.19) barely skratch
the surface of the incredibly rich category of superconstraint theory. while the abelian
nature of lorentz symmetry in 2-dimensional spacetime is the major reason of the much
larger number of possibilities for dening superconstraints, several of the truly novel super-
constraints of  2.6 are equally well possible in >2-dimensional spacetimes! unfortunately,
no natural or systematic way of enlisting and studying these non-simple, non-homogeneous
or non-linear superconstraints seems to present itself, and it is not even clear that any nite
form of enlisting is even possible or whether such eorts are worth the trouble.

clearly, however, some of these do deserve a closer study, such as the family of su-
perconstraints (2.49), which interpolates continuously between chiral and twisted-chiral
superelds, and hence between models the ir regime of which is believed to correspond
to mirror compactications in string theory. a similar family interpolating between p-
reected models does not seem to be possible in 2-dimensions, as p does not commute
with lorentz symmetry. even in supersymmetric quantum mechanics, a construction of
such an interpolation is obstructed because p does not leave the superalgebra (1.6) invari-
ant. this seems to further deepen the chasm between mirror symmetry, as generated by
c+, and the type iiatype iib duality, as generated by p. these and related issues are
left for a subsequent study.

of course, the lagrangian density must include also the hermitian conjugate terms.

besides the contribution to the standard d-terms, leading with the terms in (b.4a),
notice the mixed kinetic terms in (b.4b), the mixed 4-fermion (fermi or thirring) terms
in (b.4gh), and the terms in (b.4f ) which change the (still algebraic, i.e., non-dynamical)
equations of motion for f, f . upon ellimination of these, the supersymmetry transforma-
tion rules become non-linear in the fermionic elds, as discussed in the last part of  3.7,
and the terms in (b.4f ) modify this non-linearity.
