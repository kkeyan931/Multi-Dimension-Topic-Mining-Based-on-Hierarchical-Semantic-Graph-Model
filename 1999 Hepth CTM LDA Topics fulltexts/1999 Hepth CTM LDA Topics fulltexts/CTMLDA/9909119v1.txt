abstract

we nd the explicit expression of the supercharges of eleven dimensional supergraviton on the
background geometry of gravitational waves in asymptotically light-like compactied space-
time. we perform the calculations order by order in the fermions , while retaining all orders
in bosonic degrees of freedom, and get the closed form up to 5 order. this should correspond
to the supercharge of the effective action of (0+1)-dimensional matrix quantum mechanics for,
at least, v4 and v6 order terms and their superpartners.

1 introduction

one of the most striking observations in the recent developments in m/string theory is the real-
ization of the deep connection between the supergravity and super yang-mills theory. among
others, one remarkable example is the ads/cft correspondence[1]. it tells us that the m/string
theory or their low energy effective supergravity on ads spaces are equivalent to the conformal
limit of super yang-mills theory on the boundary of ads spaces. this holographic nature of
the theory has been claried in [2].

another important example is matrix theory [3] in which (0+1)-dimensional su(n) matrix
quantum mechanics is conjectured to give eleven dimensional m/supergravity in the large n
limit. in the framework of the discrete light-cone quantization (dlcq), in which we take light-
cone circle with radius r, the correspondence seems to hold even for nite n [4] and then one
may understand the original matrix theory on full eleven-dimensional non-compact spacetime
as the large n limit, while keeping the light-cone momentum p = n/r xed.

from the prescriptions given in [5, 6], the dlcq m theory on t p is described by (p + 1)-
dimensional super yang-mills theory on dual torus, for up to p=3. by applying their arguments
on the supergravity backgrounds, it has been argued in [7] that, as a kind of generalization
of ads/cft correspondence, these microscopic descriptions of dlcq m theory on t p via
super yang-mills theory corresponds to the m/string theory on non-trivial backgrounds such as
plane-fronted gravitational waves or ads spaces with some identications. this can be inferred
from the simple observation that the limit considered in dlcq m theory on t p is exactly the
same as the limit considered by maldacena in [1] to get the ads/cft correspondence. it is
the natural limit if one wants to have only d-brane world-volume theory, while decoupling all
the bulk degrees of freedom. in [1], the corresponding supergravity backgrounds are found by
near-horizon limit of the supergravity solutions in the presence of source branes. in [7], those
come from taking dlcq and t-duality on the supergravity solutions of the source branes.

especially interesting cases are dlcq m theories on t 0 (noncompact ten-dimensional
spacetime) and t 1, which correspond to the original matrix theory and matrix string theory
[8], respectively. in these cases we get the gravitational waves on the asymptotically light-like
compactied spacetime as background geometry [7, 9, 10, 11].
indeed in [12], it has been
shown that the matrix quantum mechanics at one loop gives the same effective action as those
of the eleven-dimensional probe graviton on this background. subsequently, superpartners of

1

bosonic f 4 term have been explicitly obtained within matrix theory and veried to agree with
those of supergraviton on this background [13]-[21].

one may wonder why they give the correct descriptions, without good explanation on the
nature of holography. recent studies on the non-renormalization theorem of matrix model due
to 16 supercharges [22, 23, 24] strongly suggests the key role played by the supersymmetry in
these correspondences. after all, the regime that we can trust supergravity solutions is different
from the regime that we can trust yang-mills descriptions of d-branes, and only reasonable
amount of supersymmetry would connect those two regions.

in this paper, we want to shed some light on these issues.

in explicit, we nd the su-
percharge of the eleven-dimensional supergraviton in the background of gravitational waves,
which are eleven-dimensionally lifted d0 solutions. first of all, we consider the superparti-
cle on at background. the superparticle action we choose is the rst quantized version of
eleven-dimensional supergravity. if the light-cone coordinate x is periodically identied, the
light-cone momentum is quantized, p = n
r , and the single supergraviton (n = 1) moving in
that direction is described by (0+1)-dimensional u(1) matrix quantum mechanics. the original
superparticle action has target space supersymmetry, which is apparently very different from the
supersymmetry of super yang-mills theory. however, the superparticle action has additional lo-
cal world-line fermionic symmetry, namely -symmetry, and it is shown that they are identical
after choosing the light-cone gauge for this local -symmetry and modifying the original su-
persymmetry by the appropriate -transformations in such a way to preserve the gauge-xing
conditions.

in section 3 we consider the superparticle on the background geometry produced by source

gravitational waves on the asymptotically light-like compactied spacetime. as a (0+1)-dimensional
n = 16 d0 quantum mechanics, this corresponds to the effective theory of probe d0-branes
moving in the background of n source d0-branes. since the full explicit expressions for the ac-
tion of the superparticle on non-trivial background are not known, we perform the calculations
order by order in fermions  and get supercharges up to 5 order.

among others, we nd the effective lagrangian on this background is given by

in  if written in terms of vi. as the effective lagrangian contains fermions, it has the second
class constraints which can be analyzed using dirac brackets. since it is non-local, the resultant
dirac brackets are nontrivial, which is another source for non-trivial higher order corrections.

2 supersymmetry of eleven-dimensional supergraviton in the

light-cone gauge

in this section we consider the supersymmetry transformation rules of eleven-dimensional su-
pergraviton on light-like compactied spacetime. the natural gauge choice is the light-cone
gauge and the supersymmetries which preserve this gauge choice are identical to those of d0
quantum mechanics as expected.

consider the eleven-dimensional manifestly spacetime supersymmetric massless point par-

ticle action,

(2.1)

s = z dl =

2 z de1( x + i )2 ,

where  are 32 component real spinors and  = t 01. this action describes eleven-dimensional
supergraviton multiplet in at minkowskian spacetime. the equations of motion of the multi-
plet are given by those of linearized eleven-dimensional supergravity. the model has world-line

reparametrization invariance under which x and  transform as world-line scalar,

x =  x,  =  .

(2.2)

as we take the light-cone coordinate x periodic, it is natural to identify x+ as time coordinate.
the natural gauge choice for the world-line diffeomorphism in this dlcq formulation is the
static gauge

the target spacetime supersymmetry transformation laws with parameter  are given by

x+ = 2 x = 2.

 = ,

  = ,

x = i ,
e = 0 .

(2.3)

(2.4)

in addition, the action has local fermionic symmetry with parameter (), under which the
elds transform as

 = ie  p , x = i , e = 4e  ,

(2.5)

where p = e1( x + i ) denotes the conjugate momentum of x. as being local gauge
symmetry, this -symmetry reduces the  degrees of freedom by half. we can x it by choosing

+ = 0 ,  =   (16)

(16)! ,

(2.6)

where  = (10  0). note that with this gauge xing the conjugate   t 0 becomes

where  = +/2. this is in accord with the gauge xing (2.3).

is cyclic, p is conserved and we consider the xed n-sector of the theory. therefore the
appropriate effective action is given by routhian

lef f = l  p x(p) = p x ,

where the last relation in the above comes from the constraint equation

pp = 0 ,

which is also used to solve x in terms of p, xi, .

the effective lagrangian after the gauge xing (2.3) and (2.6) becomes

lef f = p(

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

which corresponds to the (0+1)-dimensional u(1) supersymmetric yang-mills quantum me-

chanics with adjoint fermions   22(16).

this tells that even though the original supersymmetry transformation laws of the rst-
quantized supergravity action (2.1) are very different from those of super yang-mills theory,
they should be the same after the gauge xing (2.3) and (2.6). half of the original supersym-
metries with + = 0 remain to be true symmetry in which

 =  ,

xi = 0 ,

even after gauge xing. these are just constant shift in spinors which also appear as trivial
kinematic supersymmetry in the d0 quantum mechanics.

on the other hand, other half of the form  = (cid:16)(16)

(16)(cid:17), corresponding to  = 0, do not

preserve the gauge xing conditions and thus the original supersymmetry transformation laws
(2.4) with these parameters should be modied in such a way to preserve those by taking appro-
priate -transformations (2.5). from the condition that total transformations should preserve
the gauge xing (2.6):

+() = +( + i  p) = 0 ,

(2.10)

we nd the relation between target spacetime supersymmetry parameter  and the kappa sym-
metry parameter  of the form,

which is given by

 =   (16)

(16)! ,

(16) =

i
2

(16) .

5

(2.11)

the total supersymmetry transformations preserve the static gauge (2.3) and are given by

 = vii ,

xi = ii

(2.12)

with   2(16). these are nothing but the supersymmetry transformation laws of (0+1)-

dimensional super yang-mills quantum mechanics at the tree level.

this suggests that the matrix model, viewed as the large n limit of dlcq m theory, in
the infrared limit may describe eleven-dimensional second-quantized dlcq supergravity, i.e.
the large n limit of rst-quantized dlcq supergravity. to conrm this conjecture, one may
construct vertex operators [19, 25] which describe generic interactions among various elds and
macroscopic objects and compare with super yang-mills theory, which is outside the scope of
this paper.

in the next section we consider the supergraviton in gravitational wave background, which
would correspond to the case of two-body interactions between two clusters of d0-particles in
which one plays the role as a source and the other as a probe.

3 supergraviton in gravitational wave background

the action (2.1) can be generalized to describe supergraviton on the general background in the
following form:

s = z dl =

1

2 z de1rsrs ,

(3.1)

where z m () = (x() , a()) are the superspace coordinates.2 the pull-back a of the
m to the particles world-line satises a = (dz m /d)ea
supervielbein ea
m. this can be deter-
mined order by order in  by following the method in [26] and is given by

r = x(er

rstst) + r  + o(4)

(3.2)

for the background geometry with vanishing three form gauge eld c and gravitino .

2in the superspace formalism, the indices (a, b, c,) collectively denote the bosonic and fermionic tangent
space indices, while (m, n, p,) collectively denote the bosonic and fermionic curved space indices. in its
component form, we use (, , ,) indices for the curved space bosonic coordinates, and (r, s, t,) indices for
the tangent space bosonic coordinates. therefore the metric rs is the lorentz invariant constant metric. spinor
indices are denoted as (a, b, c,).

6

3.1 effective action

as the background geometry we consider is independent of periodically identied coordinate
x, the quantized conjugate momentum is still conserved and, in the xed p sector, the effec-
tive action is again of the form (2.7). in [20], along the same steps as described above in the
free massless superparticle case, it was shown that the supersymmetric effective action, in the
light-cone gauge, corresponding to v4 term is the same as matrix theory effective action. the
action has world-line diffeomorphism and -symmetry as local gauge symmetries. we use the
same gauge xing conditions (2.3) and (2.6) as in the case of at spacetime background.

the eleven-dimensionally lifted d0-solution with asymptotically light-like compactica-

tion, x  x + 2r, is given by [9]

the effective lagrangian (2.7) on this background can be decided order by order in 4 using

3from now on all spinors denote 16-component spinors and subscripts are omitted.

4 a is dened by a  22f 1/4a. these play the role as the superpartner of higgs eld xi in the context

of yang-mills quantum mechanics and thus the supersymmetry transformation laws for these turn out to be much
simpler than those of . in deriving various formula, we will switch back and forth between a and a, but the
nal results are presented in terms of a.

in contrast to [20], in which only v4 terms and their superpartners are presented, we retain the
expression to all orders in vi. this may correspond to the effective lagrangian of a d0-brane
probe in the background of n d0-branes, relatively moving with the velocity vi in the trans-
verse direction. there is a non-renormalization theorem for the v4 term and its superpartners in
the (0+1)-dimensional super yang-mills quantum mechanics [22, 24]. therefore they are com-
pletely determined by the one-loop calculations and was shown to agree with the supergravity
result (3.6) [20]. the same arguments hold true for the v6 term and its superpartners and they
agree with the supergravity result (3.6) as well [23].

3.2 supercharge: leading order corrections

in the matrix model, it is extremely tedious to determine the supersymmetry transformation
laws, though still one can decide the effective action of bosonic v4 term and its superpartners
without much knowledge on those [22, 21]. in the supergravity side, the explicit form of super-
symmetry transformation rules are known up to 3 order. we use these to nd supercharges for
supergraviton in the gravitational wave background. up to v6 (and possibly to all order in v)
they should correspond to the supercharges in the matrix theory.

the supersymmetry transformation laws of elds in the supergraviton action (3.1), up to 3

order, are given by

laws are

(  )rs

 rs + o(4) ,

 = i   +
x = i + o(3),
e = 4e  + o(3) .

(3.8)

obviously the sixteen killing spinors (3.5), which correspond to the dynamical supersym-
metry in the at background limit, do not respect the gauge xing condition (2.6). at the

8

leading order in , to preserve the gauge xing condition (2.6), the transformation should be
supplemented by the -transformations of the form (2.11) with

 = i

f 1/2

1 + 1  hv2

 + o(2) .

the combined transformation law of (3.5) and (3.9) for  is given by

 =

f 1/2

1 + 1  hv2

(v  ) + o(2) .

(3.9)

(3.10)

in contrast to the at background case, the combined transformation laws do not satisfy the

gauge xing (2.3) as x+ is non-vanishing:

x+ = 4i

h

(1 + 1  hv2)

(v  ) + o(3) .

this should be compensated by world-line reparametrization with parameter

 = 2i

h

(1 + 1  hv2)

(v  ) + o(3)

(3.11)

(3.12)

in (2.2). this in turn gives additional transformations on xi and a. the overall transformation
law for xi, in the leading order in , is given by

xi = 4i(i) +  xi + o(3)

= 4i(i)  2i

h(v  )
(1 + 1  hv2)

xi + o(3).

(3.13)

the effective lagrangian (3.6) is indeed invariant under the transformation laws (3.10) and
(3.11), in the leading order terms of , up to total derivatives,

lef f = i

(v  ) + o(3) .

the corresponding supercharges can be easily obtained by noether method and are given

by the simple form:

q = p   + o(3).

(3.14)

3.3 dirac brackets and supersymmetry algebra

in order to see the above supercharges (3.14) give the right transformation laws (3.10) and
(3.11), we need to study carefully the commutation relations among elds. from the effective

9

lagrangian (3.6) one can read off the effective conjugate momenta pi of xi and a of a:

which has been dened in units of p for simplicity. note that (3.16) gives the second-class
constraints:

a = a 

i
4

(1 +q1 + hp2)a + o(3)  0

(3.17)

it is well-known that in order to deal with the second-class constraints in the hamiltonian
formalism, which is typically present in the theory involving fermions, we need to introduce
dirac brackets. lets denote (qa, pa) as elds and their conjugates collectively for bosons and
fermions. then poisson bracket between two functions f (q, p) and g(q, p) is dened as

{f ,g}p b 

rf
qa
where nf is the fermion number of f.
if the theory contains the second class constraints,
a(qa, pa)  0, the poisson bracket should be replaced by the dirac bracket which is dened
as

{f ,g}  {f ,g}p b  {f , a}p b(a1)ab{b,g}p b,

(3.19)

where aab  {a, b}p b.

in the case we consider, the poisson brackets among the elds and their conjugates are given

by

{xi, pj}p b = i

j , {a, b}p b = ab

and all others vanish. for the constraint (3.17), aab read

aab =

41 + hp2(1 + 1 + hp2)

a + o(3) .

note that the dirac brackets between bosonic and fermionic variables are highly nontrivial
representing the nonlocal nature of the effective theory.

indeed using these dirac brackets (3.22) one nds the transformation laws:

xi = ia{qa, xi} = ii  i

which agree with (3.10) and (3.13) for  = 22f 1/4.

(v  )a + o(2) ,

(3.23)

the supersymmetry algebra can be also read using these dirac brackets as

{qa, qb} = i

2
phef f ab + o(2) .

(3.24)

by replacing the dirac bracket with the (anti-)commutator, [qa, qb]+ = i{qa, qb}, we get (1.3)
up to 2 order.

3.4 higher order corrections

in this section we nd the next-to-leading order corrections to the supercharge from the trans-
formation laws (3.7). after some calculations, we nd the supersymmetry should be modied
by -transformation (2.11) (2) at the 2 order of the form:

(2) =

hv2vijh(ij)

(1 + 1  hv2)31  hv2



 .

(3.25)

the resultant transformation law for  at the next-to-leading order, which includes the trans-
formation due to the above -transformation (3.25) as well as world-line diffeomorphism by 
(3.12), becomes

(2) = if 1ih(i) + i

this becomes much simpler if we impose the effective equations of motion:

which may be considered as the full quantum corrected equations of motion of the matrix quan-
tum mechanics. up to these equations of motion, the on-shell transformation laws for yang-
mills fermions , at the 2 order, becomes

(3.27)

now we would like to determine the next-to-leading order corrections to the supercharges
which gives the above transformation law (3.27). as a commutation relation with supercharge,
the 2 order corrections in (3.27) come from the 3 order corrections of the supercharge and/or
the constraints (3.17) which give rise to the higher order corrections in the dirac brackets.

let the conjugate momenta of the s are of the form

a =

i
4

(1 +q1 + hp2)a + labcdbcd + o(5) ,

(3.28)

where labcd = la[bcd](xi, pi) are totally antisymmetric in last three indices. we assumed that a
do not depend on  when written in terms of phase space variables xi, pi. if not, these do not
give the constraints, invalidating the analysis in the lower order in . this is justied by the
consistency of the results followed. of course, when rewritten in terms of xi and vi, they have
 dependence. it will be interesting to justify these by obtaining the higher order corrections in
 to the effective action from direct calculations following the method outlined in [26].

the relations (3.28) give 3 order corrections to the second class constraints and the poisson

brackets between the constraints become

aab = 

i
2

(1 +q1 + hp2)ab  3(labcd + lbacd)cd + o(4).

(3.29)

12

the dirac brackets between the spinors a, which include the 2 order corrections, are given
by

{a, b} = 

2i

(1 + 1 + hp2)

ab +

12(labcd + lbacd)
(1 + 1 + hp2)2

cd + o(4) .

(3.30)

the supercharge may also have the 3 order corrections and thus generically can be written as

qa = p  abb + aabcdbcd + o(5) ,

(3.31)

where aabcd = aa[bcd](xi, pi) are also totally antisymmetric in last three indices. note that the
momenta pi in (3.28) and (3.31) have 2 order corrections when written in terms of vi.

in order to decide aabcd and labcd, we calculate {qa, b} and {qa, qb} and compare with
(3.27) and (1.3). these consistency conditions give the unique choice for aabcd and labcd. the
transformation laws for a with the supercharge (3.31) can be read readily using (3.22) and
(3.30) and are given by

{qa, b} = i

2p  ab

p2jhj

acc

+

(1 + 1 + hp2)
41 + hp2(1 + 1 + hp2)
[(1 + 1 + hp2)aabcd + 2p  ae(lbecd + lebcd)]

(1 + 1 + hp2)2

b

(3.32)

cd + o(4) .

by comparing with (3.27), we nd a relation:

241  hv2(cid:20)aabcd +
= (cid:20)v  ac(vijhij

bd +

dh
dt

2v  ae

(1 + 1  hv2)
bd)  v  abvijhij

(lbecd + lebcd)(cid:21)cd
cd  v2jhj

acbd(cid:21)cd .

(3.33)

the commutation relations among qas read

{qa, qb} = 2i

p2

p2ab

[p  acjhj
bd + (a  b)]
1 + hp2(1 + 1 + hp2)

(1 + 1 + hp2) 
p  be(cid:20)(1 + 1 + hp2)aaecd + p  af (lef cd + lf ecd)(cid:21) + (a  b)

cd

(1 + 1 + hp2)2

+6

cd + o(4) .

these satisfy (1.3) provided that

v  af

(1 + 1  hv2)

(cid:20)v  be(cid:18)aaecd +
241  hv2(cid:20)(cid:18)v  acjhj

(lef cd + lf ecd)(cid:19) + (a  b)(cid:21)cd

bd + (a  b)(cid:19)  vijhij

cdab(cid:21)cd.

(3.34)

from (3.33) and (3.34), we nd the unique solution

aabcd = 0 ,

labcd = 

1 + 1 + hp2
321 + hp2

pijha[bcd] ,

(3.35)

and therefore the supercharges are given by (1.2).

from this one can read off the 3 order corrections to the supersymmetry transformation

laws of xi. the dirac brackets between xi and a are given by

{xi, a} = 

hpi

21 + hp2(1 + 1 + hp2)
a  i
(2 + 1 + hp2)hpi(pkjhkj)
16(1 + 1 + hp2)(1 + hp2)3/2

+i

jh(ij)
1 + hp2

a

a + o(5) ,

(3.36)

and therefore xi transform as

xi = ii  i

hvi(v  )
2(1 + 1  hv2) 

h(vkjhkj)(v  )

8(1 + 1  hv2)2

vi

(3.37)

(jhij)(v  )
8(1 + 1  hv2)

+

hv2jh(kj)(k)

16(1 + 1  hv2)2

vi + o(5) .

4 discussions

in this paper we found an explicit form of the supercharges, up to the 5 order, of the supergravi-
ton in the background of eleven-dimensionally lifted d0 geometry. they should correspond to
the supercharges of the effective action of (0+1)-dimensional matrix quantum mechanics for,
at least, v4 and v6 order terms and their superpartners. from the perspectives of matrix quan-
tum mechanics, the simple form of the supercharges (1.2) is quite striking. note also that
this simple form makes it an easy step to go from classical, represented by dirac brackets, to
quantum, represented by commutators, without operator ordering ambiguity. it would be very
interesting to see whether it holds true to all orders in . we expect similar results hold for
higher-dimensional yang-mills theories with 16 supercharges which correspond to dlcq m
theory on torus compactication. these are under investigations.
