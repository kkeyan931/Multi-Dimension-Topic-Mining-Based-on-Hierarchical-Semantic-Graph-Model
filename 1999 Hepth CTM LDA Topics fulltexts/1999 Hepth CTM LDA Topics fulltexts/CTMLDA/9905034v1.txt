abstract

we study the relation between the d8-branes wrapped on an orientable compact
manifold w in a massive type iia supergravity background and the m9-branes
wrapped on a compact manifold z in a massive d=11 supergravity background
from the k-theoretic point of view. by speculationg on the use of the dimensional
reduction to relate the two theories in dierent dimensions and by interpreting the
d8-brane charges as elements of k0(c(w )) and the (inequivalent classes of) spaces
of gauge elds on the m9-branes as the elements of k0(c(z) k g) a connection
between charges and gauge elds is argued to exists. this connection is realized as
a map between the corresponding algebraic k-theory groups.

1. introduction

as the result of the analysis of the non-bps brane states [1] the picture of the charges
of the dp-branes wrapped on an (orientable) compact manifold w as elements of the

topological k-theory of w emerged [2, 3]. the charges of all possible dp-brane congura-
tions actually take value in the abelian groups k 0(y ), k 1(y ) and ko0(y ) for type iib,
type iia and type i branes, respectively, where y is the d=10 spacetime and w  y . by
imposing the tadpole anomaly cancellation in type iib and type i theories, the groups

reduce to gk 0(y ) and gko0(y ), respectively [3]. in type iia theory the non-existence of

any rr boundary state guarantees that there is no rr spacetime tadpole anomaly [4].

several important questions have already been addressed in literature in the frame of

this theory. the list includes the possibility of using the grothendieck groups and the
derived categories in the study of brane charges [9], the computation of brane charges in

various backgrounds [5, 7], the analysis of t-duality of non-bps states [6, 8, 12] and the
classication of descent and duality relations among branes [10].

another important problem pointed out in [3] is the understanding of the k-theory
classication of brane charges from eleven dimensional point of view. the motivation

for suspecting a connection between type iia brane charges and some d=11 objects
comes from the remark that, on one hand, the m-theory compactied on s1 is the type
iia theory and, on the other hand, the k-theory group of type iia brane charges is

gk 1(y ) = gk 0(y  s1) 1. the presence of s1 in both theories suggests that the circle

should be actually the same. however, the major obstruction in realizing this idea in a
concrete manner is the fact that there are no 10-branes in m-theory. this prevents us
from giving a sensible physical interpretation of k-theory of type iia branes in eleven

dimensions [3, 4]. one way to circumvent this diculty is to use a k-theory that satises
the following conditions: i) it allows a physical interpretation of its elements in d=11 and

ii) it represents the type iia d-brane charges in d=10.

a theory that satises the two conditions above is the algebraic k-theory [14, 15].
the group k0(c(x)) classies the nitely generated projective c(x)-modules which are
just the spaces of sections of vector bundles with base manifold x. since these sections,
at their turn, can be interpreted as gauge elds on x, k0(c(x)) satises i) above. the
condition ii) is automatically satised since by construction k0(c(w )) = k 0(w ) [15].

the other crucial ingredient neccesary to describe the d-brane charges from the eleven
dimensional perspective is a map between the branes and the corresponding objects in

1in general one can replace the gk 0(y ) group with k 0(y ) group because the corresponding k-theories

are actually kc-theories, i.e. the vector bundles satisfy, from physical requirements, some appropriate
compact support conditions [3].

d=11. this map can alternatively be thought as a map between type iia theory and the

d=11 theory in which the objects are dened. we have seen above that if the algebraic
k-theory is to be used the objects are the spaces of gauge elds. then, as the previous

discussion and the original formulation of the problem suggests, the sought for theory
in d=11 should be m-theory or a related one. another way to think of this is to notice
that the map between d=10 and d=11 theories should appear from a natural connection

between these. for m-theory and type iia theory there is such of connection given by
the dimensional reduction.

in the following we shall illustrate these ideas on a system formed from d8 and m9
branes wrapped on compact manifolds which are embedded in massive type iia and

massive d=11 supergravity backgrounds, respectively. the massive d=11 supergravity is
the one proposed in [17]. the motivation for choosing this system relies on the following

known facts. the d8-brane is the highest stable type iia d-brane and its charges
take value in k 0(w ). even if 8-brane-antibrane congurations do not contain all lower
dimensional brane congurations, as was pointed out in [4], they contain lower dimensional
brane charges. this makes k 0(w ) a nontrivial interesting object.
it is also known
that a d8-brane can be obtained from a m9-brane by double dimensional reduction 2.
a m9-brane moves freely in a massive d=11 supergravity background with a killing
isometry [16, 17, 18]. the massive d=11 supergravity is connected to the massive type

iia supergravity by dimensional reduction. moreover, its solitonic solutions include all
m-branes from which all type iia branes can be obtained by direct or double dimensional
reductions. 3 we analyse the possibility of using the dimensional reduction to connect
the objects of interest in the two theories.
in order to construct a map between the

spaces of gauge elds on the m9-brane and the d8-brane charges have to associate to the
dimensional reduction a geometrical map. in the most favorable case the same map acts

simultaneously between the backgrounds and the spaces on which the branes are wrapped.
as a general case we will assume that the dimensional reduction map acts only between
the backgrounds. we note that because of the presence of the killing isometry, the most

natural sections of vector bundles on d=11 background and its compact submanifold are
the covariant ones. these are (free generated) projective modules over the appropriate

crossed algebras [15].

the organization of the paper is as follows.

in section 2 we resume some of the

properties of massive type iia supergravity and massive d=11 supergravity. the map
between the manifolds and the algebras and the apropriate algebraic k-theory groups are

given in section 3. in section 4 we determine the correspondence between the k-theory

2the m9 branes have been initially discussed in [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26].

results which are used throughtout the paper are collected in an appendix.

while this paper has been nished we learned about an interesting analysis of massive

type ii congurations in [11].

2. d8 and m8 branes in massive supergravity backgrounds

the massive type iia supergravity has the following bosonic eld content: the metric
g, the dilaton eld , the rr one-form eld c (1) which plays the role of a stueckelberg
eld, a massive two-form eld b and a three-form potential c (3). the massless type iia
supergravity is obtained from the above theory in two steps. firstly, one has to redene the
elds in order to remove the m1 terms present in the supersymmetry transformation.
secondly, one has to take the limit m = 0. the theory displays, in string metric, a
cosmological constant that does not depend on the dilaton. this suggests that the mass

parameter can be viewed as the expectation value of the dual of a rr ten-form eld
strength.

there is a natural rr nine-form eld a9 in the spectrum of the type iia string
in order to formulate the massive type iia supergravity with this form eld

theory.

the mass parameter m should be replaced with a mass scalar eld m(x) that obeys the
constraint dm(x) = 0. the eld a9 does not introduce new degrees of freedom and enters
a lagrangian term of the form  da9m. thus, the eld strength of a9 is a lagrange
multiplier for the constraints of m(x). the solitonic solutions of the massive type iia

supergravity with the nine-form eld include the ones of massless as well as of massive
type iia supergravity. in particular, the solution that carries the a9 charge is the d8-
brane. because the solutions of this theory includes the type iia branes in a concise and

elegant manner, it was proposed that it should be considered as the eective eld theory
of the type iia superstring [20]. for latter reference we give here the bosonic part of the

massive type iia supergravity, in string frame, which has the following form [27, 20]

the massive d=11 supergravity proposed in [17] has the following bosonic eld content:
the metric g and the three-form eld c. the theory is characterized by an apriori given
killing isometry k of the background elds, i.e. k g = k
it is important to
note that, as a consequence, there is a system of coordinates in which k  =  y and the
elds do not depend on the coordinate y on the integral curve of the killing vector. in

c = 0.

order to obtain the massless d=11 supergravity one has to set the mass parameter to zero
and to restore the y dependence of elds. we recall that the massless d=11 supergravity

4

represents the eective eld theory of m-theory and the decompactifying limit of massless
type iia supergravity. at its turn, the latter is the gs   limit of type iia superstring.

the bosonic part of the massive d=11 supergravity action [17] is given by

where  represents the connection for the massive gauge transformation.

the m9-brane is a solitonic solution of the above massive d=11 supergravity conjec-
tured to exist for several reasons. one of them is the non-vanishing time component of
the two-form central charge z  of the m-theory superalgebra which also points out that
the worldvolume eld theory of the m9-brane should be n=1 (chiral) supersymmetric
[16, 32]. another argument comes from the analysis of the eleven dimensional e8  e8
heterotic string [23]. finally, the m9-brane lls in the place of the missing d=11 object
that should t into the pattern of generating d-branes from m-branes [18, 19] (see also

[21, 22, 24, 25, 26].) the massive d=11 supergravity is a theory in which the free m9-brane
moves naturally, i.e. a world-volume eld theory which contains a vector multiplet with

a single scalar necessary to position the brane, can be constructed. this is possible by
assuming that the killing isometry of the background is an isometry of the world-volume

of the m9-brane, too. consequently, the world-volume eld theory of the m9 should be a
gauged sigma model. actually, such of action was recently proposed by analogy with the
mkk-monopole [19]. like the other m-branes, the m9-brane gives rise to several type

iia branes by dierent dimensional reductions: a d8-brane by reduction along killing
isometry and two gauge sigma models called kk-7a and kk-8a, respectively, by other

reductions [19].

the type iia d8-brane can be identied with the solitonic solution of massive type
iia supergravity with nine-form which has 9-dimensional poincare invariance. this was
shown in [20] by proving that the massive 8-brane is t-dual with the type iib d7-brane

as well as with the d9-brane. another argument is that, in general, the background
between two d8-branes is the massive type iia supergravity [25].

5

3. algebraic k-theory of massive branes

in this section we construct a geometrical dimensional reduction map between massive
type iia and d=11 supergravity backgrounds and give the algebraic k-theory for d8-

branes and m9-branes and for the backgrounds in which they are wrapped.

3.1. the dimensional reduction map

let us consider a d8 brane-antibrane system wrapped on a compact submanifold w .
the massive type iia supergravity background in which w is embedded is denoted by
(y ; g, , c (1); b, c (3)), where y is the spacetime manifold on which the equations of motion
for the elds of the massive type iia supergravity hold. there is a natural inclusion map
p : w  y .
in a similar way, we take the m9-branes to be wrapped on a compact
submanifold z in the massive d=11 supergravity background (x; g, c; k) and the natural
inclusion i : z  x.

in order to connect the theory in d=11 with the one in d=10, we need a map between
them. let us consider the possibility of using the dimensional reduction of the back-
grounds. if we denote by  the elds {g, c} and by  the elds {g, , c (1), b, c (3)}, the
dimensional reduction can be thought as the a map

 :   

(3.1)

which explicitely maps (g) = (g, , c (1)) and ( c) = (b, c (3)). the precise correspon-
dence between the components by dimensional reduction is given by [17]

gyy(x) = e

cy(x) = b(x)

(3.2)

(3.3)

for the d=11 three-form eld. if we introduce (3.2) and (3.3) in the eleven dimensional
action (2.2) then we obtain the type iia action (2.1) by using a palatini type identity.
the two gravitational constants are related by g10
n since it is assumed that
the integral curve of the killing vector is a circle of radius equal to the string length ls [17].
consequently, we can obtain solutions of the equations of motion of (2.1) from solutions
of motion of (2.2) by dimensional reduction [18, 19]. this shows that if we assume the

m = (2ls)g11

6

dimensional reduction map (3.1) between the two background elds in dierent dimensions

we should extend it to the spacetime manifolds

 : y  x.

(3.4)

another way to see that is to notice that  is equivalent to the explicit relations (3.2) and

(3.3). at their turn, these represent relationships among the component elds, which are
functions on x and y, respectively. in order to have the equality between the functions

in the both hand sides of (3.2) and (3.3), a relationship between the domains of the
arguments dom(x) = x and dom(x) = y must exist. this relationship is the explicit
form of the map .

in the adapted coordinate system in which (3.2) and (3.3) are written, the functions
on x do not depend on the coordinate y. however, since k is a killing vector, in principle,
one can extend  over the entire manifold x [42]. the relation (3.4) denes a geometrical
map between the two spacetime manifolds. depending on the direction on which the
dimensional reduction is performed we can arrive at dierent manifolds y from the same
x. for example, y can inherit a killing isometry if the dimensional reduction is performed
along a direction transversal to k or does not inherit it if the direction is along k.

in a standard fashion,  induces the map between continuous (smooth) functions

 : c(x)  c(y )

(3.5)

which is a homomorphism between the c-algebras of all continuous functions on x and
y , respectively. actually, like in the case of , the map is not dened over the full c(y )
since the functions depending on y are left aside. therefore, (3.5) denotes, by an abuse
of notations, the induced map by the extension over y .

the concrete realisation of the maps (3.4) and (3.5) depends on the choice of the

specic solutions of the equations of motion of the two massive supergravity theories.
this choice also determines their properties. the general analysis that follows relies
mainly on the homomorphism (3.5).

3.2. d=10 algebraic k-theory

the charges of the d8-branes belong to the topological k-theory group k 0(w ). its
elements are equivalence class of the complex vector bundles e  w . alternatively, they
can be interpreted as the elements of the group k0(c(w )) that classies the spaces of
gauge elds over w .

in order to see that, let us denote by (e) the sections of e. (e) can be thought as
a nitely generated projective module over the ring (algebra) c(w ) of all complex-valued

7

continuous functions over w . 4. by a theorem by serre and swan [38], there is a complete
equivalence between the category of vector bundles over a compact space and the bundle
maps and the category of projective modules of nite type over commutative algebras

and module morphisms. in particular, there is an isomorphism between the monoid of
isomorphism classes of complex vector bundles over w (with whitney sum) and the
monoid of isomorphism classes of nitely generated projective modules over c(w ) ( with
ordinary direct sum) [14, 15]. this isomorphism suggests that a group similar to k 0(w )
could be constructed for the projective modules of sections of bundles. the construction

is standard and goes as follows [13, 14, 15, 37].

let us take the algebra mn(c(w )) of n  n matrices with entries in c(w ). this
can be identied with the algebra c(w, mn) of all continuous functions from w to the
algebra of n  n complex matrices. every idempotent of c(w, mn) is a nitely generated
projective module over c(w ) and it can be obtained from a bundle over w . dene next
the inductive limit of nite matrices mn(c(w )) by

m(c(w )) =

mn(c(w ))

[n=1

with the natural embedding

 : mn(c(w ))  mn+1(c(w )) , a 7 (a) =" a 0
0 1 # .

(3.6)

(3.7)

since c(w ) is an unital c-algebra 5 every idempotent p  c(w ) belongs to the set
q(c(w )) = {p  c(w ) : exp(2ip) = 1}. two matrices a  qn(c(w )) and b 
qm(c(w )) are equivalent if a and b have similar trivial extensions in some qk(c(w ))

a  b   a = a  0kn  qk(c(w )) , b = b  0km  qk(c(w ))

 u  glk(c(w )) : a = ubu1,

(3.8)

where gln(c(w )) is the group of all invertible elements of mn(c(w )). the set of
eqivalence classes under  in nqn(c(w )) is an abelian semigroup denoted by j(c(w )).
denote by uj(c(w )) the universal group of j(c(w )) and by e(c(w )) its subgroup
generated by elements of the form {a + b}  {a}  {b}, where {a} is the equivalence class
of a in uj(c(w )). then the rst algebraic k-theory group is dened as

k0(c(w )) = uj(c(w ))/e(c(w )).

(3.9)

4since k 0(w ) contains information about the topology of w , we work with c(w ). if the bundles are

real, the module of sections is dened over cr(w ), the ring of real-valued functions over w .

5the structure of c-algebra is given in the supremum norm ||f (x)|| = supxw |f (x)|. the involution
 : c(w )  c(w ) is the usual complex conjugation. unital means that there is an element i  c(w )
such that f i = if = f f  c(w ). all the algebras are commutative.

8

the group k0(c(w )) is the grothendieck group of the monoid of isomorphism classes
of nitely generated projective c(w )) modules. by construction it satises the following
identities

k 0(w ) = k0(c(w ))

k 0

r = k0(cr(w ))

(3.10)

for complex and real vector bundles, respectively.

eq.

(3.10) allows us to interpret the d8-brane charges as elements of either the
topological k-theory group k 0(w ) or the algebraic group k0(c(w )) and to shift from
the complex vector bundles to sections which have the nice physical interpretation as

gauge elds. the amount of information in both descriptions is the same due to the
serre-swann theorem.

to c(w ) we can associate another algebraic abelian group k1(c(w )) as follows. we

construct rstly the group

ln(c(w )) = gln(c(w ))/gl0

n(c(w )),

(3.11)

where gl0
n(c(w )) = exp(mn(c(w )) is the component of identity of mn(c(w )). the
canonical homomorphism gln(c(w ))  gln+1(c(w )) induced by (3.7) yields a ho-
momorphism ln(c(w ))  ln+1(c(w )) which makes the sequence {ln(c(w ))} into a
direct limit system of groups. by denition, k1(c(w )) is this limit and it is an abelian
group

k1(c(w )) = lim



ln(c(w )).

(3.12)

we note that, by deniton, k1(c(w )) takes into account the topology of c(w )6.

since the denitions (3.9) and (3.12) do not depend on a specic manifold w , they
can be used for the compact manifold z and for compact spacetimes x and y . if x and

y are not compact, the above denitions no longer apply.

assume, for deniteness, that x is just a locally compact manifold. the corresponding
algebra c0(x) of complex-valued continous functions vanishing at innity is non-unital.
in this case we take the one point compactication x + of x and adjoin the unity to
c0(x) to form the algebra c0(x)+. the map c0(x)  c0(x)+/c0(x) determines a
complex homomorphism 0 of c0(x)+ which yields the homomorphism

0 : k0(c(x +))  k0(c) = 0


(3.13)

6for any ring r one can construct two groups k1 by factorizing gln(r) with gl0

n(r) like in (3.11)
or with en(r) which is the group of elementary matrices in gln(r). in general, en(r)  gl0
n(r) and
thus the two groups dier. by construction, only (3.11) contains topological information about the ring
r.

9

fk0(c0(x)) = ker
fk1(c0(x)) = k1(c0(x +)).

0

(3.14)

the natural algebraic fk-theory groups are then dened in the usual manner by [14, 15, 37]

we see that the mathematical construction of the algebraic k-theory groups is sensible
to the topology of the manifolds that characterize our physical objects. in general, the

properties of k- and fk-theories are not the same, so we should work with well dened

topological spaces. for simplicity, we will assume in what follows that both spacetimes x
and y are compact. moreover, when necessary, base points x0  z  x and y0  w  y
are understood to be singled out. if the spacetime manifolds are only locally compact,
one should work with their one point compactications and with (3.14) but some extra

care should be taken since, in general, dierent results are obtained.

3.3. d=11 algebraic k-theory

even for both x and z compact, the groups k(c(x)) and k(c(z)) are not ap-
propriate to describe the d=11 spacetime and the m9-branes, respectively. the reason is
that there is a killing isometry k in the massive d=11 supergravity background. also,
if we want to obtain the 8-brane from the 9-brane by dimensional reduction, we have to
perform it along the direction of the killing isometry, which implies that this direction

belongs to the world-volume of the m9-brane, too.

the killing isometry, being a homeomorphism, induces the homeomorphisms k and
k of c(x) and c(z), respectively. regarding k as the action of a uni-parametric group
g on x and z, k and k represent the induced actions on c(x) and c(z), respectively.
the most appropriate algebras for describing the sets (c(x), k, g) and (c(z), k, g)
are the crossed product algebras c(x) k g and c(z) k g, respectively. the crossed
product algebra c(x) k g is dened as the twisted convolution algebra cc(g, c(x)) of
continuous functions from g to c(x) with a natural c-norm [15] 7. it is important to
note that the unitary representations of the c-algebra c(x) k g correspond exactly
to the covariant representations of (c(x), k). the same remarks are true for z.

in order to make an explicite connection between d8-brane system and the m9-branes

7the involutive algebra is given by

(1  2)(g) =z 1(h)k

h(2(h1g))dh

for any i  cc(g, c(x)), g,h  g, and

where  : g  r

+ is a modular function on g.

(g) = (g)1k

g ((g1)),

10

(3.15)

(3.16)

by using the k-theory, it is necessary to establish a relationship between c(x) and
c(x) k g. this mathematical problem has not been solved completely yet for an
arbitrary group g. however, important results have been already derived for simply con-

nected and solvable lie groups, compact groups and some other groups with a simple
structure [15]. in what follows we will primarily consider the cases when g = r, z and
t where t = r/z is the one dimensional toric group. in the last section we will discuss

the more interesting case when g is an arbitrary compact group.

in the case when k represents the action of the real additive group g = r on x, we

use a theorem due to connes [15] that establishes the following isomorphism

kp(c(x)) k r) = kp1(c(x)),

(3.17)

where p = 0, 1. similar isomorphisms exist if r is replaced by an arbitrary simply con-
nected and solvable lie group.

if the group is g = z, the dual group of the one-dimensional torus, a theorem by
pimsner and voiculescu states that the following cyclic six-term exact sequence connects
the algebraic k-theories of c(x) and c(x) k z [15]

k0(c(x))

1k
 k0(c(x))

 k0(c(x) k z)

 

 

(3.18)

k1(c(x) k z)

 k1(c(x))

1k
,

k1(c(x))

 is the induced map by k in the k-theory and  is the induced map by c(x) 

where k
c(x) k z.

a more interesting case is when g = t = r/z is the torus group. then the following

cyclic six-term sequence is exact [15]

k0(c(x) k t)

1k
 k0(c(x) k t)

t

(3.19)

t k1(c(x) k t)

1k
, k1(c(x) k t)

where  is induced by the quotient map

 : c(x) k r  c(x) k t.

(3.20)

here, we wrote explicitely all the maps in the exact sequences for later reference. similar
sequences exist for z and k.

11

despite the fact that the six-term exact sequences have a limited general applicability,

they provide useful information in many particular cases. we discuss this problem in the
last section.

4. the relationship between type iia and d=11 algebraic
k-theories

in this section we are going to derive a map between the groups k0(c(w )) and
k0(c(z) k g) which are associated with the d8-brane charges and the spaces of co-
variant gauge elds on the m9-branes, respectively.

it is instructive to consider rst the general situation in which the dimensional re-
duction map acts only between x and y . there are natural inclusion maps for the pair

(x, z)

i

j

: z  x

:

(x, )  (x, z)

and similar ones for the pair (y, w )

p : w  y

q

:

(y, )  (y, w ).

(4.1)

(4.2)

a consequence of the bott periodicity theorem (see theorem 1 from appendix) states that
there are the following homomorphisms within the topological k-theory cohomologies of

the pair (x, z)

given by

r

l

: k 0(z)  k 1(x)

: k 1(z)  k 0(x),

r = j   (  ) ,

l = j   

(4.3)

(4.4)

here,  is the coboundary map and  is the bott isomorphism. similar homomorphisms

can be constructed for the pair (y, w ), namely

f 

g 

: k 0(w )  k 1(y )

: k 1(w )  k 0(y )

given by the compositions

f  = q  (   ) , g  = q  ,

where the coboundary map is  and the isomorphism is  .

(4.5)

(4.6)

since the connes thom isomorphism (3.17) and the exact sequences (3.18) and (3.19)
involve higher groups k1, we need to connect it with k 1. in general, there is no iso-
morphism between the two groups [14, 15]. however, since in our setup the algebras of

13

continuous functions on x, z, y and w are unital c-algebras and since k1 was dened
using (3.12) according to novodvorskiis theorem, the gelfand transform induces an iso-
morphism kp  k p, p = 0, 1 for any of these algebras [41] (see also theorem 2 from
appendix.) let us denote these isomorphisms by  for x,  for z,  for y and  for w .
then it is easy to verify that we have the following maps between the algebraic k-theory
groups

m

: k0(c(z))  k1(c(x)) , n : k1(c(z))  k0(c(x))

u

: k0(c(w ))  k1(c(y )) , v : k1(c(w ))  k0(c(y )),

(4.7)

where m, n, u and v denote the following composition maps

m =   r  1 , n =   l  1
u =   f   1 , v  =   g   1.

(4.8)

the properties of these maps are esentially the same as of (4.4) and (4.6) which are given
by the theorem 1 from appendix.

while for the type iia algebraic groups u and v represent the end of the story,

in d=11 we have to pass to the algebraic k-theory of the crossed product algebras as
discussed in the precedent section.

consider rstly the case g = r and denote by x

 the connes thom isomor-
phisms for x and z, respectively. by using (4.7) to connect the k-theories of c(x) and

 and z

c(z) we obtain the following composition maps

r : k0(c(z) k r)  k1(c(x) k r)
r : k1(c(z) k r)  k0(c(x) k r),

where r and r are given by

  n  z



r = x
r = x

  m  z
 .

(4.9)

(4.10)

we see that the map between the two sets of abelian groups (r, r) is twisted in
the sense that it changes the indices 0 and 1.

in the case g = z, the dual group of t, we use the pimsner-voiculescu exact sequence

(3.18) for both x and z. next, as above, we use m and n to relate the two sequences.
from the sequences obtained we can read o the following maps

z : k0(c(z) k z)  k0(c(x) k z)
z : k1(c(z) k z)  k1(c(x) k z),

(4.11)

14

which are given by the following compositions

z =   (1  k
z =   (1  k

)  n  

)  m  .

(4.12)

here,  : k1(c(x))  k1(c(x) k z) is the map induced by the natural inclusion
 : c(x)  c(x) k z and  : k1(c(z) k z)  k0(c(z)) is the vertical map
of the pimsner-voiculescu exact sequence. k
 denotes the induced map in the algebraic
k-theory by k. unlike the pair (4.9) discussed above, the pair (z, z) is not twisted.

we proceed in the similar manner in the case g = t = r/z. we construct the cyclic

six-term exact sequences for x and z using (3.19) and we connect them with m and n.
as a result we obtain the pair

t : k0(c(z) k t)  k0(c(x) k t)
t : k1(c(z) k t)  k1(c(x) k t),

where t and t are composed by

t =   m  t

t =   n  t

(4.13)

(4.14)

where t : k1(c(z)) k t)  k1(c(z)) and  is the vertical map in the exact sequence
(3.19) of z. the pair (4.14) is not twisted. we also note that t and t are dened in
a minimal way, i.e. without any reference to the action of k on either x or z.

by construction, the properties of  and  are given by the properties of the com-

ponent maps for all the groups discussed above. it is important to notice that, although
some of the components of these maps enter exact sequences for g = z, t and are connes

thom isomorphisms for g = r, the composition maps do not belong, in general, to exact
sequences due to the presence of m and n. exacteness is a supplementary condition

which imposes the usual ker/im constraints on the components.

let us return to the main problem of determining the map between the relevant

d=10 and d=11 algebraic k-theory groups. we remark that for g = z there is no
obvious physical interpretation of the connection between the massive type iia and the

massive d=11 supergravity branes and backgrounds in terms of dimensional reduction
map. however, it is instructive to study this case because the exact sequence (3.19) in
the more interesting case g = t is a pimsner-voiculescu like sequence. the case g = r
can be thought of as the decompactifying limit of the killing direction r  .

the starting point is the dimensional reduction map  which induces the homomor-
phism  between the unital c-algebras c(x) and c(y ). this is assumed to be an unital

15

homomorphism. due to the categorical properties of the algebraic k-theory,  yields
the homomorphisms between the algebraic k-theory groups kp(c(x)) and kp(c(y )),
p = 0, 1, denoted by 
. consequently, it also connects the exact sequences in d=10 and
d=11.

in the case g = r, by connecting the sequences in dierent dimensions we obtain the

following sequences

. . .  k1(c(z) k r)  k0(c(z))  . . .  k0(c(x) k r)

 k1(c(x))


 k1(c(y ))  k0(c(w ))

(4.15)

and

. . .  k0(c(z) k r)  k1(c(z))  . . .  k1(c(x) k r)

 k0(c(x))


 k0(c(y ))  k1(c(w ))

(4.16)

in general, (4.15) and (4.16) are not exact. however, we can dene some composition
maps ar and br between the algebraic k-theory groups associated to the wrapped
8-brane and 9-brane systems

ar : k1(c(z) k r)  k0(c(w ))

br : k0(c(z) k r)  k1(c(w ))

(4.17)

the expresion of these maps can be easily deduced from the sequences (4.15) and (4.16)

and using (4.8) and (4.10) one can see that they have the following form

ar = u1
br = v1

  
  

  x

  r

  x

  r.

(4.18)

the properties of ar and br are determined by those of the components and of 
. in
order to the sequences (4.15) and (4.16) be exact, 
 , m and n should
satisfy the ker/im exacteness conditions. it is an easy exercise to write them down from

 as well as u1

 , v1

(4.8), (4.10) and (4.18).

in the case g = z we can do a similar analysis since  has a geometrical character.
however, the discussion in this case is purely formal and there is no physical interpretation
in terms of the dimensional reduction of the d=11 spacetime x to the d=10 spacetime
y . the sequences built out of 
by

 from exact sequences in dierent dimensions are given

. . .  k0(c(z))  k0(c(z) k z)  k1(c(z))  . . .

 k0(c(x) k z)  k1(c(x))


 k1(c(y ))  k0(c(w ))

(4.19)

16

and

. . .  k1(c(z))  k0(c(z) k z)  k0(c(z))  . . .

 k1(c(x) k z)  k0(c(x))


 k0(c(y ))  k1(c(w ))

(4.20)

the composition maps that can be constructed from these sequences act only geometri-
cally between the k-theories in dierent dimensions as follows

az : k0(c(z) k z)  k0(c(w ))

bz : k1(c(z) k z)  k1(c(w ))

(4.21)

and they are composed from the following homomorphisms

az = u1
bz = v1

  
  

    z

    z.

(4.22)

we emphase once again that presently we cannot claim that (4.22) have any physical
signiance. however, they are helpful in understanding the next case.

when k represents the action of the group g = t on the manifold x, the homomor-

phism 

 enters the following sequences

. . .  k0(c(z) k t)  k0(c(z))  . . .

 k1(c(x) k t)  k1(c(x))


 k1(c(y ))  k0(c(w ))

(4.23)

and

. . .  k1(c(z) k t)  k1(c(z))  . . .

 k0(c(x) k t)  k0(c(x))


 k0(c(y ))  k1(c(w ))

(4.24)

these sequences dene the maps at and bt between the corresponding k-groups of the
dimensional reduction of the background x. they act as follows

at : k0(c(z) k t)  k0(c(w ))

bt : k1(c(z) k t)  k1(c(w ))

(4.25)

from the relations (4.8) and (4.14) we obtain the following expressions

at = u1
bz = v1

  
  

  t  t

  t  t.

17

(4.26)

like in the previous cases, the properties of at and bt are given by the properties of the
components. another common feature with the other cases is that the sequences (4.23)
and (4.24) are not, in general, exact.

note that in the decompactifying limit of the killing direction, the 8-brane charges are
obtained rather from the k1 associated to the 9-branes than from k0 whose elements are
equivalence classes of isomorphic gauge eld spaces. this shows that the group k1(c(w ))
becomes important in those situations in which the massive d=11 background with m9-

branes wrapped inside is subject to the dimensional reduction and ends into a massive
type iia background with d8-branes wrapped inside, in the limit where the direction of
the killing isometry decompacties.

if during the process of dimensional reduction the m9-branes reduce to d8-branes,

a map  between z and w exists. if the two reductions, of the background and of the
9-branes, respectively, hold simultaneously and along k, then we can take  = |, where |
is the reduction of  to z. however, in our analysis we can take a more general situation
in which  is independent of |. the particular case emerges from this one at equality.

let us denote by 

 the induced map between the algebraic k-theories and consider
the case g = t. since the wrapped 8-branes are obtained by dimensionally reducing
the 9-branes, the two dierent gemetrical map compositions from kp(c(z) k t) to
kp(c(w )) should form commutative diagrams for p = 0, 1. using (4.26) and (4.25) these
diagrams can be written as

k0(c(w ))

 


k1(c(z))

t

 a
 k0(c(z) k t)

k1(c(w ))

 


k0(c(z))

t

 b
 k1(c(x) 
k

t)

(4.27)

the resulting relations between maps represent constraints on at and bt they are
consequence of the condition that the d8-brane system is obtained from a m9-brane
system. note that these constraints do not imply at = bt since in the two diagrams in
(4.27) the maps 

 and  are actually splitted, acting on dierent groups.

in the case g = z we can also require the existence of the map  between z and w as
above. the dierence occurs in that there are no physical reasons for taking  = | and,
more important, for assuming that the diagrams corresponding to (4.27) are commutative.

if g = r, the above construction can be repeated but in order to impose naturally the
commutativity of the diagrams we have to take rstly a nite radius of the killing direction
and afterwards to let it go to innity.

we note in the end of this section that if x and y are only locally compact, one can
repeat the above analysis if we take x + and y + instead of the original spacetime man-
ifolds. however, if the backgrounds are general, we must check out if the corresponding

18

algebras of continuous functions are commutative c-algebras with unity.

19

5. discussions

it is of interest to see if the above analysis provides any information about all type
iia d-brane charges which take values in the topological k-theory group k 1(y ) [3, 4].
by novodvorskiis theorem (see theorem 2 from appendix) this group is isomorphic with
k1(c(y )) in which k1(c(x)) is mapped by the corresponding 
 map. consequentely,
if g = t we can extract from the sequence (4.23) the following map

ct : k0(c(x) k t)  k1(c(y )),

where

ct = 

  t.

(5.1)

(5.2)

this function maps the covariant equivalent spaces of gauge elds from k0(c(x) k
t), i.e. dened on the massive d=11 supergravity background spacetime x with the
toric killing vector action, on the type iia d-brane charges in the massive type iia

background y . similar maps can be constructed for g = r and g = z. we note now
that no reference is made to any 9-brane. as a matter of fact, the subsequence of (4.23)
in which ct is dened as a composition do not include any group of z as can be easily
veried. the is also true for the other two groups.

another important problem concerns the amount of information that can be extracted
from the maps constructed in the previous section. the point here is that in constructing

(4.9), (4.11) and (4.13) we used the connes thom isomorphism, the pimsner-voiculescu
six-term exact sequence and its consequence (3.19). while the isomorphism preserves

the maximum of information while going from one group to another, the same is no
longer true for the cyclic six-term exact sequences since the same group appears in two
places. however, despite this limitation, six-terms sequences are a powerfull tool in many

particular cases.

to illustrate this fact, let us consider that the 9-branes are wrapped on s10. in this

case the algebraic k-theory groups are given by

k0(c(s10)) = z/2z
k1(c(s10)) = 0.

(5.3)

by introducing (5.3) in the six-exact term sequence for, say, g = z we obtain the following

relations

k0(c(s10) k z) = (z/2z)/im(1  k
)
k1(c(s10) k z) = im(1  k
)

(5.4)

20

which contain information about the k-groups as well as the action of the group of

integers on the compact space. we can obtain similar relations for g = t or g = r.
these relations can be used to improve our knowledge of the maps a and b, respectively.

another simplication of the sequences used to connect the relevant groups appears
when the manifolds on which the 8- and 9-branes are wrapped are deformation retracts

of the corresponding spacetime manifolds. without presenting any details, we just note
that if we take for example (x, z) a compact pair then (x +, z +) is pointed since the two
base points are identied with the point at innity and if we further assume that z + is
also a retract of x + the topological k-groups satisfy [13, 14]

since we have the following relations

fk p(z +) = fk p(x +).

(5.5)

(5.6)

fk p(x +) = kp(c(x))
fk p(z +) = kp(c(z))

supplementary relations among the maps m and n are given by the following sequence

k0(c(z)) m k1(c(x))

k

k

k1(c(z))

n k0(c(x))

(5.7)

which connects the sequences that dene  and  as composition maps.

there can be many topological congurations in which the six-term exact sequences

provide more information than in their general formulation. thus we conclude that the
maps between the relevant groups which were constructed in the previous section carry

signiant information about the system.

so far we have considered mainly noncompact killing vectors k. let us briey discuss
some of the particularities of the more realistic theories with a compact killing isometry
viewed as the action of a compact group. consider the general case of a larger compact
group of isometries g of both x and z which are also compact manifolds 8.

let us denote by k and action of g on x and by k an action on z. to all actions {k}
correspond actions of g on c(x) and on the vector bundles e  x. a g-vector bundle is
a vector bundle e for which the g-action is induced in a way that the projection e  x
is equivariant. like for usual vector bundles one can establish an exact correspondence
between g-vector bundles and nitely generated projective modules of c(x) k  g. in

8in the case when k = k the group is g = u (1).

21

particular, there are g k-theory groups the following isomorphisms hold [15]

g



dg



: k g

: k g

0 (c(x))  k0(c(x) k  g)
0 (c(x))  k0(c(x)),

(5.8)

0 (x) is the abelian group of equivalence classes of g-vector bundles and k g

where k g
0 (c(x))
is the abelian (grothendieck) group of equivalence classes of nitely generated g-projective

modules over c(x). the same construction can be done for z and we denote the isomor-
phisms (5.8) in this case with g

 , respectively.

 and eg

in analogy with the case studied in the previous section, we would like to nd a map
between the g-covariant gauge elds on m9-branes and the d8-brane charges. proceeding
along the same line, we denote by ig
in k-theory. it is not dicult to see that by using 
obtain the following sequence

 the map induced by the natural inclusion of z in x
 discused in the previous section we

k0(c(z)  k  g)  k g

0 (c(z))      k0(c(y ))  k1(c(w )).

(5.9)

unfortunately, this sequence denes a map between the equivalence classes of spaces of
g-covariant gauge elds on m9-branes from k0(c(z)  k  g) and the group k1(c(w )).
the result is unwanted since we do not know how to interpret the later group in terms of
8-branes.

in order to solve this problem we pick up a subalgebra a of c(w ) which makes the

following split sequence exact

0  a a

 a

 c(x)/a  0

(5.10)

but otherwise arbitrary. the standard exact sequence theorem [9, 15] states that the

associated six-term cyclic sequence is exact. from this we can extract the k-theory map

a
 = a

    a
 ,

(5.11)

where  is the composition of the suspended index map  : k2(c(x)/a)  k1(a) with
the bott map. note that a
 is independent of g but depends on the choice of a. using
a
 we can map the equivalence classes of spaces of g-vector elds on the m9-branes on
the d8-brane charges. explicitely, we have the following map

ga



: k0(c(z)  k  g)  k0(c(w ))

where the expresion of ga



in terms of components is given by

ga

 = (a

 )1  v1

  

  dg

  ig

  (eg

 )1  (g

 )1.

(5.12)

(5.13)

22

we note that, in general, the map (5.13) cannot be completely satisfactory because it

depends on the arbitrary algebra a. from the physical point of view we can speculate
that a should be identied with the algebra of continuous functions on some compact
submanifold u  w on which some lower dp-branes are wrapped on. in any case, the
choice of a submanifold u reduces further the symmetries of the system.

appendix

in this appendix we collect two classical mathematical results. the rst theorem is a

consequence of botts theorem for topological k-theory of pointed compact pairs.

theorem 1 let (m, n) be a pointed compact pair and let i : n  m , j : (m, ) 
(m, n) denote the natural inclusions. in the following diagram

    k 2(m)

i
 k 2(n)



 

k 0(n)

k 1(m, n)
 

j 
 k 1(m)

i 
k 0(m)

j 
 k 0(m, n)

i 

 

k 1(n)

,

(.14)
where the top row is the exact sequence of the pair (m, n). then the hexagonal part of

the diagram is exact. here,  is the coboundary map

 : k p(n)  k p+1(m, n)

and  is the bott isomorphism

 : k p(m, n)  k (p+2)(m, n).

(.15)

(.16)

the second theorem is a particular case of a theorem by novodvorskii [41, 37] which

establishes under what circumstances the topological and algebraical k-theory groups of
a commutative banach algebra are equivalent.
in our case, the algebras of continuous

functions in the theorem below are c-algebras which implies that they are also banach
algebras.

theorem 2 the gelfand transform c0(m)  c( d(c0(m)), where m is a locally compact

space, induces an isomorphism

fkp(c0(m)) = fk p(m +) , p = 0, 1.

(.17)

similarly, the gelfand transform c(m)  c( dc(m)), where m is a compact space,

induces an isomorphism

kp(c0(m)) = k p(m) , p = 0, 1.

(.18)

classes of irreducible representations of c(m) (or the space of its maximal ideals). this
space can be identied setwise as well as topologically with m. for any element f  c(m)

here, dc(m) is the gelfand space of the algebra c(m), i. e. the space of equivalence
its gelfand transform is the complex valued function f : dc(m)  c given by f () = (f )
for any   dc(m).
