using the recently developed soldering formalism we highlight cer-
tain featuers of quantum mechanical models. the complete correspon-
dence between these models and self dual eld theoretical models in
odd dimensions is established. the distinction between self duality
and self dual factorisation in these dimensions is claried.

self dual models in odd dimensions, characterised by the presence of
chern-simons terms [1], have been in vogue for quite sometime [2, 3]. in-
terest in these models has been rekindled by noting their relevance in higher
dimensional bosonisation [4]. some new results in this connection were re-
ported in [5] by using the concept of soldering [6]. interestingly, several facets
of self dual eld theories in odd dimensions may be better appreciated and
understood by looking at their one dimensional counterpart - the so called
topological quantum mechanics [7]. in this paper we discuss the concepts of
self duality and soldering in the context of topological quantum mechanics.
some familiar results are explained in a dierent setting, leading to fresh
insights. this analysis is extended to the self dual eld theoretic models in
odd dimensions. some new results are reported clarifying, in particular, the
distinction between self duality and self dual factorisation.

the quantum mechanical topological models are governed by the la-

grangian [7],

l =

2

~x

m
2

+ e ~x. ~a(~x)  ev (~x)

(1)

implying the motion of a particle of mass m and charge e in the external
electric (iv ) and magnetic (iaj  j ai) elds. for the simplest explicitly
solvable model [7], the motion is two dimensional (i = 1, 2) and rotation-
ally symmetric in a constant magnetic eld(b) and a quadratically scalar
potential so that,

1

ijxjb

ai =

v =

the lagrangian (1) therefore simplies to (setting e=1),

l =

m
2

xi

2 +

b
2

ijxi xj 

k
2

2

xi

(2)

there are some interesting features of this lagrangian. if the magnetic eld
is switched o (b=0), the model represents a bi-dimensional harmonic oscil-
lator,

lh.o =

m
2

xi

2 

k
2

2

xi

(3)

now consider the motion of the particle in the absence of the electric eld so
that we have,

l+ =

m
2

xi

2 +

b
2

ijxi xj

(4)

let us next illustrate the connection between (4) and (3). together with (4),
consider the lagrangian (5) with an independent set of coordinates yi and
where the direction of the magnetic eld is reversed,

l =

m
2

yi

2 

b
2

ijyi yj

(5)

it is now possible to combine (4) and (5) by the soldering formalism [5, 8].
consider the following transformation,

which eects the changes,

where,

xi = yi = i

l = ji i

and zi = xi, yi. introduce the soldering eld wi transforming as

ji(z) = m zi  bjizj

then the rst iterated lagrangian,

wi = i

l(1) = l+ + l  (j+i(x) + ji(y))wi

transforms as,

including the term wi

l(1) = 2m iwi

2 now yields an invariant lagrangian,

l = l(1) + mwi

2

;

l = 0

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

since wi is an auxiliary variable, it is possible to eliminate it by using the
equation of motion,

wi =

1
2m

(j+i + ji)

(13)

the solution is compatible with the variations (6) and (9). inserting (13)
into (12), the nal soldered lagrangian is obtained,

m

qi

b2
2m

2

qi

l =

;

qi =

2

(xi  yi)

(14)

which is no longer a function of x and y independently, but only on their
dierence. identifying k with b2
m , it is found that (14) exactly maps on to
(3). this exercise shows how two identical particles moving in the presence
of magnetic elds with same magnitudes but opposite directions simulate
the eect of a single particle moving in the presence of a quadratic scalar
potential.
it is easy to supplement the above lagrangian analysis by the familiar hamil-
tonian formulation [7]. the hamiltonian corresponding to (4) is given by,

h+ =

1
2m

(pi +

2

ijxj)

b
2

where pi is the conjugate momentum,

pi =

l+
 xi

= m xi 

b
2

ijxj

making a canonical transformation,

p = p1 

1
2

x2

b
2

x1 
we obtain, in the new canonical variables,

x =

p2

h+ =

2m

p+

2 +

1
2

b2x+

2

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

the hamiltonian is that of the usual h.o. it is however expressed only in
terms of (x+, p+) while the other canonical pair (x, p) gets eliminated. the

4

fact that the two dimensional lagrangian (4) simplies to a one dimensional
oscillator (19) is essentially tied to its symplectic structure. likewise (5)
yields the hamiltonian for the h.o expressed only in terms of the canonical set
(x, p). thus the combination of (4) and (5) should yield a two dimensional
h.o. which is precisely shown by the soldering mechanism leading to (14).

it is worthwhile to mention that the massless version of (2),

l0 =

b
2

ijxi xj 

k
2

2

xi

(20)

also yields a one dimensional h.o. the simplest way to realise this is by
eliminating either x1 or x2 in favour of the other. in this sense it is similar
to (4). correspondingly, a soldering scheme can be developed.

going back to the original lagrangian (2), it is well known [7] from a hamilto-
nian analysis that the model corresponds to two decoupled one-dimensional
oscillators described by the canonical pairs (x, p)and frequencies  where,

p = r 
x = s m

p1 s m

(21)

these are the analogous of (17), (18). while the hamiltonian analysis
reveals the decoupling of (2) into the two one-dimensional osillators, the
soldering formalism will explicitly demonstrate the reverse process. let us
therefore consider the following independent lagrangians,

l =

l+ =

1
2
1
2

(ijxi xj  

2xi

2)

(+ijyi yj  +

2yi

2)

(22)

(23)

these lagrangians are similar to the previous cases (see, for instance (20)),
except that the frequencies are dierent . as stated before both these

5

represent one dimensional harmonic oscillators but there are two points which
ought be stressed. the equations of motion are given by,

xi =

ij xj

1

1
+

yi = 

ij yj

(24)

(25)

dene a dual eld as,

xi =

1


ij xj

the duality property is only on-shell because,

xi =

1


ij xj = xi

requires the use of the equation of motion. in this sense, therefore, equa-
tions (24) and (25) characterise self and antiself dual solutions, respectively.
moreover, as discussed in [5, 8], it is possible to interpret the lagrangians (22)
and (23) as chiral oscillators with varying frequencies  rotating in clock-
wise and anticlockwise directions. thus the ubiquitous role of self duality
and chriality becomes apparent in these models. the process of soldering will
combine the dual aspects of these symmetries to yield a new model expressed
in terms of the composite variable (x  y). under the transformations,

the lagrangians undergo the variations,

xi = yi = i

l = ijjji

; z = x, y

; ji(z) = ( zi + ijzj)

inserting the auxiliary variable wi transforming as,

w i = ijj

it is posible to construct, in analogy with (12), the following lagrangian,

l = l(x) + l+(y) + wi(ji

(x) + ji

+(y)) 

1
2

(+

2 + 

2)wi

this expression is on shell invariant. eliminating wi by using the equation
of motion, the above lagrangian is recast in the manifestly invariant form,

l =

(+  )ijxi xj

2

xi = s +

2 +

2

(xi  yi)

(26)

where use has been made of the onshell conditions (24, 25). identifying the
frequencies  with those occurring in (21) we nd,

+   =
+ =

b
m
k
m

(27)

after a suitable scaling it is now simple to observe that the lagrangian in
(26) exactly reproduces (2).

the above exercise therefore shows, in a precise manner, how the self and
anti-self dual (or, alternatively, the left and right chrial) oscillators combine
to yield the model (2). for identical frequencies (+ =  = ), the epsilon
term in (26) vanishes so that the lagrangian (3) is obtained, a result found
earlier [5, 8] in a dierent context. this is also expected since (3) was derived
directly from a soldering of (4) and(5), models which are equivalent to (22)
and (23) with identical frequencies.

we conclude our discussion on the topological quantum mechanics by point-
ing out that the equation of motion obtained from (26) fatorises into its dual
(chiral) components as follows,

(+ij + ijt)(jk  jkt)xk = 0

the possibility of this factorisation is ingrained in the soldering of (22) and
(23) (with equations of motions (24) and (25), respectively) to yield the nal
structure (26).
it is now straightforward to extend the preceding analysis to odd dimen-
sional eld theories. in this context we recall that (2) had been regarded [7]

7

analogous to the lagrangian density for three dimensional topologically mas-
sive electrodynamics (maxwell-chern-simons theories) in the weyl (a0 = 0)
gauge,

in our scheme of things, however, we should interpret (2) to be the analouge
of the topologically massive electrodynamics augmented by the usual mass
term,

ls =

(28)

a = [a]

in the limit where all spatial derivatives are neglected [1]. correspondingly,
(22) and (23) would be interpreted as the analogous of the self and anti-self
dual models [3]

l(g) =

l+(f ) =

(29)

(30)

once again in the limit where all spatial derivatives are ignored. since (22)
and (23)were soldered to yield (2), it is natural to think that (29) and (30)
should be soldered to yield (28). this is indeed true as will now be shown.
indeed the soldering mechanism leads to an equivalent lagrangian (28) with
the following identications,

a = f  g

m+  m = 
m+m = m2

(31)

which is highly reminiscent of the quantum mechanical analysis. to begin
with the soldering consider the gauging of the following symmetry,

8

f  = g = 

(32)

under these transformations , the anti-self and self dual lagrangians change
as ,

where the currents are given by,

l = j



j 
 (h) = h 

1
m

[h]

;

h = f, g

(33)

(34)

next, the soldering eld b, which is a two form gauge eld transforming
as,

b =    

1
2m

(   )

(35)

is introduced. in analogy with the quantum mechanical analysis, it is possible
to dene a modied lagrangian,

l = l+ + l +

1
2

bb 

1
2

b(j +

(f ) + j (g))

(36)

which transforms as,

[(f +

1
m+

f ) + (g 

1
m

g)]  [  ] (37)

l =

1
2m

where,

m =

m+m
m+  m

(38)

it is useful to observe that (37) vanishes for m+ = m.
in that case the
lagrangian becomes gauge invariant under the transformations (32). the
auxiliary b eld can be eliminated from (36) in favour of the original
variables by using the equation of motion. the nal lagrangian then turns
out to be the proca model with the basic eld as a = f  g. incidentally,
following our system of ignoring spatial derivatives, the proca model just

9

reduces to the bi-dimensional harmonic oscillator (3). likewise, (30) and (29)
with m+ = m can be identied with (20) and its dual partner. the soldering
in the latter case leads to (3) which provides another correspondence between
the quantum mechanical and eld theoretical models.
in the same spirit
it may be realised that (4) would be the analogue of the maxwell-chern-
simons theory. the equivalence of (4) with (20) therefore indicates a similar
connection between the mcs theory and the self dual model (29) - a fact
which has been established earlier using various approaches [3, 9].

coming back to the soldering mechanism for dierent masses (m+ 6=
m), it is seen that the variation (37) is non zero. it is possible to make
further alterations to (36) so that the new lagrangian is gauge invariant. such
alterations invariably require terms involving derivatives of the soldering eld
b. in that case a simple elimination of this eld in favour of the other elds
, by using the equations of motion , would not be possible. that would defeat
our purpose of recasting the lagrangian in terms of the dierence (f  g);
a form in which it would be manifestly gauge invariant leading to a new
structure.
it is now observed that by relaxing the requirement of gauge
invariance to be only on-shell, in which case

f = 

g = +

1
m+

1
m

 f 

 g

(39)

(40)

then l in (37) indeed vanishes and the lagrangian is gauge invariant. this
is reminiscent of the quantum mechanical analysis.
returning to a description in terms of the original variables is now possible
by eliminating b, which acts as an auxiliary eld, from (36)

b =

1
2

(j +

 + j 
)

(41)

it should be mentioned that this solution is compatible with the variation

(35) since

1
2

(j 

+ (f ) + j 

 (g)) =    

1
2m

(   ) = b

inserting the solution (41) in (36) and using the on-shell conditions (39) and
(40) one obtains the chern-simons-proca lagrangian (28) with the identi-
cations (31).
a straightforward extionsion of the above analysis in d = 4k  1 dimensions
would lead to the soldering of the self and anti self-dual lagrangians,

f 12k = [1a22k]

where in the latter expression antisymmetrisation is done with respect to all
the indices in the square bracket and m is as dened in (38). note that the
basic variables (f, g) are (2k1)-form elds. for identical masses , m+ = m,
the generalised proca model is obtained .
next let us discuss the factorisability property. as noted in [10]1 the equation
of motion following from (28) factorises as,

1there is a sign error in this ref

(45)

for identical masses (m+ = m) this reduces to the proca equation. the
structure of the factorisation has led to the claim that the massive modes in
these models satisfy the self duality condition. that this is not so is easily
shown. consider, for simplicity, the following generating functional for the
proca lagrangian,

zp [j, j] = z dae 1

2r [lp +aj+ aj ]d3x

where, the dual has also been introduced,

a =

1
m

 a

the result of the gaussian integration is ,

zp [j, j] = e 1

m j )c  (j + 1

m  j  )

2r (j+ 1

2

where,

c (x, y) =

]  (x  y)
it is now easy to calculate the relevant correlation functions,

(m2 + )

[g +

(46)

(47)

(48)

(49)

(50)

(51)

it is seen that all the correlation functions cannot be related modulo only
local terms. thus it is not possible to interpret a = a operatorially .
hence the a eld cannot be regarded as self dual.

the origin of the structure of the factorisation in (45) is understood from
the soldering analysis performed earlier. the two factors correspond to the
self dual and anti self dual modes, not in the model (28), but rather in the
models (29) and (30), respectively. it is the soldering mechanism that has

12

precisely combined these modes from distinct models with elds f and g
to yield the new model (28) with the eld a = f  g. this new eld a
is altogether a seperate entity which lacks the original symmetry properties.
to conclude, we have used the soldering formalism to abstract dier-
ent quantum mechanical models starting from the basic harmonic oscillator.
the analysis was directly extended to eld theory in odd dimensions where
exploiting the self duality property, the soldering formalism was eectively
employed. it was striking that all the results and interpretations found in the
quantum mechanical examples had the exact analogues in the eld theory.
