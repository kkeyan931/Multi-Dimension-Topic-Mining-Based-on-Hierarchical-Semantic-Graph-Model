abstract

using ads/cft correspondence we found the conformal anomaly from d3
and d5 gauged supergravity with single scalar (dilaton) and the arbitrary
scalar potential on ads-like scalar-gravitational background. such dilatonic
gravity action describes the special rg ows in extended gauged sg when
scalars lie in one-dimensional submanifold of complete scalars space. this
dilaton-dependent conformal anomaly corresponds to dual non-conformal
(gauge) qft (which is classically conformally invariant) with account of ra-
diative corrections. equations of motion in d5 gauged supergravity put some
restrictions to the dilatonic potential on the conformal boundary. using
these restrictions we propose the candidate c-functions away from exact con-
formity. these c-functions are positively dened and monotonic, expressed
in terms of dilatonic potential and have the xed points in asymptotically
ads region.

five-dimensional gauged supergravity (sg) plays an important role in
ads/cft correspondence[1]. it is known that dierent versions of d5 gauged
sg (for example, n = 8 d5 gauged sg[2] with fourty-two scalars and non-
trivial scalar potential) may appear as a result of truncation of d10 iib sg.
in particular, ads5  s5 deformed truncation of iib sg (with non-trivial
scalars) corresponds to some specic solution of d5 gauged sg. hence, it is
often enough to study 5d gauged sg classical solutions in ads/cft set-up
instead of the investigation of non-linear iib sg solutions. such (deformed)
solutions describe rg ows in dual boundary eld theory (for a very re-
cent discussion of such ows, see [16, 3, 4] and refs.
it is very
interesting that even 4d curvature or non-zero temperature eects may be
taken into account in bulk description of such rg ows [5].
in consider-
ation of extended d5 gauged sg solutions there are often more symmetric
(special) rg ows where scalars lie in one-dimensional submanifold of com-
plete scalars space. (then such theory corresponds to d5 dilatonic gravity
with non-trivial dilaton potential). such ows may also correspond to cer-
tain (d3)-brane distributions [6]. however, note that it is extremely dicult
to make the explicit identication of deformed gauged sg solution with the
corresponding non-conformal dual gauge theory4.

therein).

the important characteristic of boundary (gauge) theory in ads/cft
correspondence is the conformal anomaly which may be found from the bulk
side (see paper by witten in ref.[1]). the calculation of conformal anomaly
in d5 gauged sg with single scalar and constant scalar potential (dilatonic
gravity) on dilaton-gravitational background via ads/cft correspondence
it was shown that n = 4 super ym the-
has been initiated in ref.[12].
ory covariantly coupled with n = 4 conformal sg [7] is actual dual of d5
dilatonic gravity (see also derivation of anomaly in gravity-complex scalar
background in refs.[8, 13]). from holographic rg description (see refs.[9, 10]
4 by this we mean that in at space only n = 4 sym theory is considered to be exactly
conformally invariant one among interacting theories. as a result, its exact conformal
anomaly which is not renormalized is known. of course, all dual boundary theories we
consider, like qcd, etc. are classically conformally invariant in curved spacetime, while
we call them here non-conformal to mention the dierence with n = 4 sym. hence, all
these theories have well-dened conformal anomalies with account of radiative corrections.
however, these conformal anomalies are explicitly unknown. their calculation has been
done in few simple theories (qed, gauge theory without fermions) but only up to two- or
three-loops. it is a challenge to nd exact conformal anomaly for gauge theories. probably,
only sg-description may help in resolution of this problem

for introduction) it is known that dilaton (or in more general case, scalars)
describe the couplings of dual (gauge) theory, say, masses, scalars or coupling
constants. hence, it is extremely interesting to get the conformal anomaly
from gauged sg with non-trivial scalar potential. this may give much better
understanding of rg ows in dual (non-conformal exactly) boundary theory
and also the denition of analog of central charge (c-function) away of exact
conformity. even more, considering the conformal anomaly (up to some loop)
of dual general boundary theory with radiative corrections and comparing
it with the one from bulk gauged sg may help in correct identication of
dual boundary theory with correspondent bulk identication (which is cur-
rently non-easy task). note also that conformal anomaly plays an important
role in the construction of local surface counterterm for gauged sgs with
non-constant scalar potential [14].

in the present letter we nd the ads/cft conformal anomaly from d3
and d5 gauged sg with single scalar (dilaton) and arbitrary dilaton poten-
tial. this situation corresponds to special rg ow in dual description. the
acceptable candidates for analogs of central charge (or more exactly, of c-
function) away of exact conformity are proposed when equations of motion
are partly used. the monotonity and positivity of c-functions is shown, they
have standard xed points in asymptotically ads region.

we start with the bulk action of d + 1-dimensional dilatonic gravity with

the potential 

s =

16g zmd+1

dd+1xq gn r + x()( )2 + y ()  + () + 42o .

(1)
here md+1 is d+1 dimensional manifold whose boundary is the d dimensional
manifold md and we choose (0) = 0. such action corresponds to (bosonic
sector) of gauged sg with single scalar (special rg ow). note also that
classical vacuum stability restricts the form of dilaton potential [15]. as
well-known, we also need to add the surface terms [11] to the bulk action
in order that the variational principle to be well-dened. we should only
note here that the surface terms become irrelevant nally in the calculation
for the weyl anomaly given in this work. the equations of motion given by
variation of (1) with respect to  and g are

gij = 1gij .

(5)

here l is related with 2 by 42 = d(d  1)/l2. if gij = ij, the boundary
of ads lies at  = 0. note that we follow the method of calculation in
refs.[12, 13] where dilatonic gravity with constant dilaton potential has been
considered.

the action (1) diverges in general since the action contains the innite
volume integration on md+1. the action is regularized by introducing the
infrared cuto  and replacing

z dd+1x  z ddxz

d , zmd

ddx(cid:16)  (cid:17)  z ddx (cid:16)  (cid:17)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)=

(6)

we also expand gij and  with respect to :
gij = g(0)ij + g(1)ij + 2g(2)ij +    ,  = (0) + (1) + 2(2) +    . (7)
then the action is also expanded as a power series on . the subtraction of
the terms proportional to the inverse power of  does not break the invari-
ance under the scale transformation g = 2g and  = 2 . when
d is even, however, the term proportional to ln  appears. this term is not
invariant under the scale transformation and the subtraction of the ln  term
breaks the invariance. the variation of the ln  term under the scale trans-
formation is nite when   0 and should be canceled by the variation of
the nite term (which does not depend on ) in the action since the original
action (1) is invariant under the scale transformation. therefore the ln  term
sln gives the weyl anomaly t of the action renormalized by the subtraction
of the terms which diverge when   0 (d=4)

the terms propotional to 0 with ,  = i, j in (3) lead to g(1)ij in terms of

for () = 0 case, the central charge of the conformal eld theory is given
by the coecient of r. then it might be natural to introduce the analog of
central charge c, i.e. c-function for the case when the conformal symmetry
is broken by the deformation as follows :

c =

(13)

comparing this with radiatively-corrected c-function of boundary qft may
help in correct bulk description of such theory.
if candidate c-function is
getting non-monotonic in some region that indicates to breaking of sg de-
scription there.

we now consider the case of d = 4. the anomaly terms which propor-

tional to ln are

then we can get the anomaly terms (14) in terms of g(0)ij and (0), which
are boundary values of metric and dilaton respectively by using (15), (16),
(17), (18). as we are only interested in c-function away from conformity, we
present the coecients of r2
(0), which appear in weyl anomaly
(12). for this reason, we neglect the terms containing the derivative with
respect to xi. here we choose l = 1 and denote ((0)) by  and abbreviate
the index (0) for the simplicity.

and we can nd that the standard result (conformal anomaly of n = 4 super
ym theory) is reproduced. in order that the region near the boundary at

  0. we can also conrm that h  1

and   0 even if  6= 0 and  6= 0. in the ads/cft correspondence, k
and h should be related with the central charge c of the conformal eld theory
(or its analog for non-conformal theory). since we have two functions h and
k, there are two natural ways to dene the c-function when the conformal
eld theory is deformed:

which agrees with the denition used in the works [17, 18] (where equations
of motion were actually used) in above limit. the c1- or c2-functions in (28)
give the new candidate for c-function away of conformity.

the denitions of the c-functions in (13) and (28), are, however, not
always good ones since our results are too wide. that is, we have obtained
the conformal anomaly for arbitrary dilatonic background which may not be
the solution of original d = 5 gauged supergravity. as only solutions of d5
gauged supergravity describe rg ows of dual qft it is not strange that
above candidate c-functions are not acceptable. they quickly become non-
monotonic and even singular in explicit examples. they actually measure
the deviations from sg description and should not be taken seriously. as
pointed in [21], it might be necessary to impose the condition  = 0 on
the boundary which follows from the equations of motion of d5 gauged sg.
anyway as  = 0 on the boundary in the solution which has the asymptotic
ads region, we can add any function which proportional to the power of
 = 0 to the previous expressions of the c-functions in (13) and (28). as a

11

trial, if we put  = 0, we obtain

instead of (28). we should note that there disappear the higher derivative
terms like  or . that will be our nal proposal for acceptable c-function
in terms of dilatonic potential. the given c-functions in (31) also have the
property (29) and reproduce the known result for the central charge on the
boundary. since   0 in the asymptotically ads region even if the region
is uv or ir, the given c-functions in (30) and (31) have xed points in the
asymptotic ads region dc

we can now check the monotonity in the c-functions. for this purpose,
we consider some examples. in [6] and [16], the following dilaton potentials
appeared:

in both cases v is a constant and v = 2. in the classical solutions for the
both cases,  is the monotonically decreasing function of the energy scale
u =  1
2 and  = 0 at the uv limit corresponding to the boundary. then
in order to know the energy scale dependences of c1 and c2, we only need to
investigate the  dependences of c1 and c2 in (31). as the potentials and also
 have a minimum  = 0 at  = 0, which corresponds to the uv boundary
in the solutions in [6] and [16], and  is monotonicaly increasing function of

12

the absolute value ||, we only need to check the monotonities of c1 and c2
with respect to  when   0. from (31), we nd

therefore the c-functions c1 and c2 are monotonically decreasing function of
 or increasing function of the energy scale u as the c-function in [4, 16].
we should also note that the c-functions c1 and c2 are positive denite for
non-negative . for c in (30) for d = 2 case, it is very straightforward to
check the monotonity and the positivity.

in [17], another c-function has been proposed in terms of the metric as

follows:

cgppz =  d

dy!3

,

where the metric is given by

ds2 = dy2 + e2dxdx .

(35)

(36)

the c-function (35) is positive and has a xed point in the asymptotically
ads region again and the c-function is also monotonically decreasing function
of the energy scale. the c-functions (30) and (31) proposed in this paper are
given in terms of the dilaton potential, not in terms of metric, but it might be
interesting that the c-functions in (30) and (31) have the similar properties
(positivity, monotonity and xed point in the asymptotically ads region).

in summary, we found the conformal anomaly from d3 and d5 gauged
supergravity with single scalar and arbitrary scalar potential on the scalar-
gravitational background. it corresponds to the conformal anomaly of dual
boundary theory. the proposal to dene c-function which is positively de-
nite and monotonically decreasing and dened in terms of dilatonic potential
is given. our work may be extended for d5 gauged sg with bigger number
of scalars (say n = 8 gauged sg) and arbitrary scalar potential. the nal

13

result appears in really complicated and lengthy form as it will be shown in
another place. this opens the possibility of explicit check if the results on
rg ows in dual gauge theory (deformed n = 4 super yang-mills) presented
in refs.[4, 16] from bulk side indeed describe 4d gauge yang-mills theory with
lesser supersymmetry and the correspondent identication is correct. from
another side, our conformal anomaly in the spirit of ref.[19] may be used
to calculate the casimir energy in dilatonic gravity. as the nal remark let
us note that dilaton-dependent conformal anomaly found in this work may
be used for calculation of anomaly induced eective action of non-conformal
boundary qft in the presence of scalars (see ref.[20] for related example of
dilaton dependent induced eective action in susy yang-mills theory).
