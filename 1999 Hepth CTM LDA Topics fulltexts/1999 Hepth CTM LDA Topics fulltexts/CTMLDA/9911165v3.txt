new exact solutions of brane-world cosmology are given. these solutions include an arbitrary
constant c, which is determined by the geometry outside the brane and which aects the cosmolog-
ical evolution in the brane-world. if c is zero, then the standard cosmology governs the brane-world
as a low-energy eective cosmological theory. however, if c is not zero, then even in low-energy
the brane-world cosmology gives predictions dierent from the standard one. the dierence can be
understood as dark radiation, which is not real radiation but alters cosmological evolutions.

superstring theories [1,2] have been considered as strong candidates for the theory of everything. among them, the
e8  e8 heterotic superstring theory has been traditionally considered as the most relevant one for phenomenology
since e8 includes the gauge group of the standard model as a subgroup. on the other hand, recent progress on
dualities between various string theories and m-theory made it possible to investigate strong coupling behavior of
them [3]. in particular, horava and witten [4] showed that strong coupling limit of the e8  e8 superstring theory
can be described by the 11-dimensional supergravity, which is considered as a low-energy eective theory of m-theory,
compactied on s1/z2 of large radius. in their scenario, the coupling constant of the heterotic superstring theory
is interpreted as radius of s1/z2, and matter elds are conned on two 10-dimensional timelike hypersurfaces which
correspond to xed points of s1/z2. moreover, after compactication on a calabi-yau manifold, the theory of matter
on each of the two xed-point hypersurfaces, which is 4-dimensional after compactication, is n = 1 supersymmetric
e8 gauge theory. there is evidence that over a wide range of energy scale this 5-dimensional picture holds [5,6]. thus,
in this picture our 4-dimensional universe is one of the 4-dimensional timelike hypersurfaces, or the world volume of a
3-brane, in 5-dimensional spacetime compactied on s1/z2. all matter elds including those of the standard model
is conned on the 3-brane.

although this picture seems satisfactory as a derivation of the theory of matter elds in 4-dimension, it is expected
at least for a moment that kaluza-klein modes of gravitational eld might spoil it. the large radius of s1/z2 implies
that mass gap of kaluza-klein modes is small and that there appears a tower of innite number of light kaluza-klein
particles, which contradicts experiments.

recently, it was found that the above embarrassing expectation is not correct. randall and sundrum [7] showed
that, for small perturbations around a at brane-geometry, zero modes of gravitational eld, which are massless on
the brane and which correspond to gravitational eld on the brane-world, are trapped on the brane due to the brane
tension. moreover, no kaluza-klein modes which are massive in the 4-dimensional theory in the brane-world are
strongly coupled to the gravitational zero modes and matter elds on the brane. therefore, horava-witten scenario
seems satisfactory as a derivation of the theory of weak gravitational eld as well as matter elds in 4-dimension.

now, one of the problems in string theories and m-theory is that there is no direct experimental or observational
evidence of them. in this respect, it seems very eective to investigate cosmological implications of these theories,
since the universe is considered to be in very high energy at its early stage. since the horava-witten scenario
seems very satisfactory as explained above, many authors investigated cosmology in the 3-brane world based on
the scenario [8,9].
(many complementary works have been done on black holes [10,11], non-linear analysis [12],
gravitational force between two bodies [13], and ads/cft correspondence [14].) however, no global solution in
5-dimension which gives the standard cosmology in the brane world have been given yet. the purpose of this paper
is to give it and investigate its cosmological implications.

as a ve-dimensional geometry, let us consider a metric of this form

ds2

5 = n (, w)d 2 + r(, w)(dx2 + dy2 + dz2) + dw2.

(1)

we consider a negative cosmological constant, which is interpreted as an expectation value of 3-form eld in horava-
witten scenario, and seek a general solution of the einstein equation ga
b /2 in bulk for this ansatz. here, k
is a positive constant. it is easy to calculate the einstein tensor for this metric, and the result is

b = 3k2a

(5)

where dots and primes denote derivatives with respect to  and w, and i and j denote x or y or z. since the
( w)-component of the einstein equation, g

w = 0, becomes ( r2/n r) = 0, n (, w) is written as

n (, w) = f ( )

r2(, w)
r(, w)

,

(6)

where f ( ) is a positive function of  . substituting eq. (6) into eq. (2), the (  )-component of the einstein equation,
 = 3k2/2, becomes r  k2r = 1/2f . hence, r(, w) is written as
g

r(, w) = ( ) cosh (kw) + ( ) sinh (kw) 

1

2k2f ( )

,

(7)

where ( ) and ( ) are functions of  . for this form of r(, w) it is easy to conrm by using eq. (5) that the
(ij)-components of the einstein equation, gi
j/2, are satised. it is easy to show that the remaining equation
w = 3k2/2 becomes  (4k4(2  2)  1/f 2) = 0. therefore, f (t) is written as
gw

j = 3k2i

where c is a constant.

f ( ) =

2k2p2( )  2( ) + c

,

(8)

note that two functions ( ) and ( ) and the constant c are arbitrary. however, these degrees of freedom should
include degrees of freedom of coordinate transformations. in fact, we can dene a new time variable t and a function
a(t) of t so that the metric obtained above is transformed to the following form.

ds2

5 = 

2(t, w)
(t, w)

dt2 + (t, w)a2(t)(dx2 + dy2 + dz2) + dw2,

where  and  are given by

1 + 2k2(2h 2 + th)
 = cosh (kw) + 2k2(h 2 + th)(cosh (kw)  1) 
1 + 4k2h 2 + ca4
 = cosh (kw) + 2k2h 2(cosh (kw)  1) p1 + 4k2h 2 + ca4 sinh (kw),

sinh (kw),

(two signs of terms including sinh (kw) should be taken to be the same) and h(t) is determined by a(t) as

the new time variable t and the function a(t), which is arbitrary for the moment, are dened by

h =

ta
a

.

= pn (, 0),
a(t) = pr(, 0).

therefore, the solutions of the einstein equation ga
b /2 which have been obtained by using the ansatz (1) are
written in the form (9) with eqs. (10-11). the function a(t) is arbitrary for the moment, but the evolution equation of
it will be determined below by so called israels junction condition [15] at the brane. on the other hand, the constant
c will be arbitrary to the end.

b = 3k2a

let us suppose that a 3-brane is at w = 0. hence, because of the z2-symmetry, the geometry in bulk should be

invariant under parity transformation w  w. thus, the 5-dimensional metric is given by eq. (9) with

1 + 2k2(2h 2 + th)
 = cosh (kw) + 2k2(h 2 + th)(cosh (kw)  1) 
1 + 4k2h 2 + ca4
 = cosh (kw) + 2k2h 2(cosh (kw)  1) p1 + 4k2h 2 + ca4 sinh|kw|.

sinh|kw|,

(13)

(as in eq. (10), two signs of terms including sinh|kw| should be taken to be the same.) note that the induced metric
on the brane at w = 0 is

and, thus, is the at frw metric with the scale factor a(t).

now, in order to give evolution equations of a(t), we use so called israels junction condition [15]:

q dxdx = dt2 + a2(t)(dx2 + dy2 + dz2),

[q ] = 0,

[k  kq] = 2

5s ,

(14)

(15)

(16)

where [x] denotes limw+0 x  limw0 x, s is the surface energy-momentum tensor on the brane, and the
extrinsic curvature k of the constant-w hypersurface and its trace k are dened by k  q
 n and
k  k 
 is the ve-dimensional covariant derivative with respect to the metric we have obtained and
n is the unit normal to the constant-w hypersurface given by n = w. since eq. (15), which represents a gauge
condition, is satised automatically for our metric, we shall concentrate on eq. (16).

 . here, (5)

we assume that the surface energy-momentum tensor is a sum of a surface tension term and a perfect uid term:

as in refs. [7], the surface tension is assumed to be related to the bulk cosmological term as

 = 32
5 k.

(17)

(18)

(19)

this relation arise in the ve-dimensional eective theory of the horava-witten scenario [4,16]. it would be worth
while mentioning that deviation from eq. (19) will produce non-zero cosmological constant in the brane-world.

since k 

  kq

 is given by

  k = 
j  ki
k i
j = 
the left hand side of eq. (16) is calculated as

k

[k 

  k] = 3kp1 + 4k2h 2 + ca4,
j  ki
1 + 4k2h 2 + ca4

3 + 4k2(3h 2 + th) + ca4

j(cid:3) = k

(cid:2)k i

.

thus, eq. (16) becomes

3k(cid:16)p1 + 4k2h 2 + ca4  1(cid:17) = 2
 1(cid:19) = 2
31 + 4k2h 2 + ca4

3k(cid:18) 3 + 4k2(3h 2 + th) + ca4

these are the cosmological equations on the brane-world. these equations combined with an equation of state
determines a(t), (t) and p(t) uniquely as functions of time, provided that suitable initial conditions are given. the
constant c is still arbitrary and its physical meaning as dark radiation will be discussed below.

the undetermined signs in the above equations will be determined by considering a low-energy limit as follows.
in order to seek low-energy eective cosmological equations, we should consider the case in which k2h 2  1 and
ca4  1. in this case, eqs. (22) become

where the newtons constant gn is given by

(23)

(24)

eqs. (23) are the same as equations in the standard cosmology, provided that the lower signs are taken and the terms
linear in a4 are absorbed in  and p. therefore, the lower signs should be taken in all equations.

if the arbitrary constant c is zero, then the low-energy evolution equations of a(t) completely agree with equations
in the standard cosmology. however, if c is not zero, then new terms appear in the evolution equations. we shall
now investigate how these terms can be interpreted. eqs. (23) can be written as

thus, the terms linear in a4 can be considered as a shift of radiation density. since non-zero value of c does
not implies real existence of radiation but changes cosmological evolution equations, it can be understood as dark
radiation. here, note that the constant c can be both positive and negative, depending on the geometry in bulk.
to be precise, the term proportional to c can be understood as the electric part of the 5-dimensional weyl tensor
in the general frame work developed in ref. [9]. moreover, it can be shown that if c is positive then there appears
a naked singularity in 5-dimension [17]. thus, the constant c should be zero or negative, which implies that energy
density of the dark radiation should be zero or positive.

in summary, we have obtained new exact solutions of brane-world cosmology. these solutions include an arbitrary
constant c. the constant c is determined by the geometry outside the brane and aects the cosmological evolution
in the brane-world.
if c is zero, then the standard cosmology governs the brane-world as a low-energy eective
cosmological theory. however, if c is not zero, then even in low-energy the brane-world cosmology gives predictions
dierent from the standard one. the dierence can be understood as dark radiation, which is not real radiation
but alters cosmological evolutions. density of the dark radiation should be zero or positive.
