renormalization group ow and parallel transport with

non-metric compatible connections

brian p. dolan and alex lewis.

abstract

a family of connections on the space of couplings for a renormalizable eld theory is
dened. the connections are obtained from a levi-civita connection, for a metric which
is a generalisation of the zamolodchikov metric in two dimensions, by adding a family of
tensors which are solutions of the renormalization group equation for the operator product
expansion co-ecients. the connections are torsion free, but not metric compatible in
general. the renormalization group ows of n = 2 supersymmetric yang-mills theory
in four dimensions and the o(n)-model in three dimensions, in the large n limit, are
analysed in terms of parallel transport under these connections.

in this letter we investigate geometrical properties of the renormalization group ow
in some exactly solved theories. the renormalization group ow can be seen as a vector
ow in the space of theories, with the couplings of the theory ga being coordinates on
this space . in this approach, it has been shown in [1] following a suggestion in [2] (see
also [3, 4] that the renormalization group equations for multi-point correlation functions,
written in a coordinate covariant form, depend on a symmetric connection a
bc through a
tensor  a

where gab(p, q) = ha(p)b(q)i and the dots denote contact terms that are only important
for large momenta. however, there is no general rule for nding a connection. moreover,
since the rg equations only depend on the connection through the tensor  a
bc, there
is in fact a family of connections which give the same equations. the approach we
take is therefore to determine the full family of possible connections for some exactly
solvable models, and investigate the geometrical properties of the rg ow for the most
general connection. for two connections  and  with covariant derivatives  and  and
curvatures r and r respectively to both be compatible with eq. (1) we must have

solution is to use the levi-civita connection of a metric on the space of couplings. an
example of such a metric is the zamolodchikov metric in d = 2, which was used in the
proof of the c-theorem [5]. more recently, building on ideas laid out in [3], the geometrical
properties of metrics in d > 2 have also been investigated for some models, including:
free eld theory [6], the o(n) model [7] and seiberg-witten theory for su(2) [8]. in all
these models, it was found that some (but not all) of the rg ow lines are geodesics of
the metric. in particular, the lines of crossover between xed points are geodesics, and
this may be related to irreversibility of the renormalization group ow. since we now
have a family of connections which are equivalent, at least as far as the renormalization
group equations are concerned, it is natural to ask whether the geodesic ow of the lines
of crossover generalises to auto-parallel ow for other connections (a line which is auto-
parallel for the levi-civita connection is a geodesic).

we distinguish between auto-parallels, which are curves whose tangent vectors remain tangent vectors
under parallel transport along the curve, and geodesics, which are curves of shortest length. in general,
these coincide for the levi-civita connection only.

our main aim is to see which of the possible connections, if any, will satisfy this equation
for a given renormalization group trajectory. in particular, some of the trajectories in the
models we will examine in this letter are geodesics of the metric, so eq. (5) is satised for
g = 0. in that case, eq. (5) simplies to the condition that

ga

where  is another function.

a natural candidate for a metric on the space of couplings is the two-point correlation

functions of the model [3]. if the action s is linear in the couplings,

then a metric can be dened by

s = s0 +z ddxgaa(x)

gab = z ddxh (x) (0)i

(7)

(8)

where (x) = (x)  h(x)i. although the individual components of this metric may
diverge, the geometry can still be non-singular.
as our rst example, we consider the o(n) model for large n in 3 dimensions. this

is a model of a scalar eld ~ in the vector representation of o(n) with the action

following [7] we analyse the geometry in terms of three bare parameters, , x, , dened
by

although these are bare parameters, they are nite as we have a nite cut-o , so we
can use them as our coordinates on the space of couplings (since we are in any case only
interested in properties of the rg ow which are independent of the coordinate system).
the beta functions, which represent a vector ow on this space are [7]

(11)

in [7] the metric (8) was computed, and it was found that only one of the renormalization
group trajectories described by these beta functions is actually a geodesic of the metric
- the line x =  = 0, which is the line of crossover from the wilson-fisher xed point
at  =  to the gaussian xed point at  = 0. we now want to see if any of the
o
renormalization group trajectories are auto-parallel for a connection  =


o

 +g, where

is the levi-civita connection from [7] and g is a solution of eq. (4). using bare rather
than renormalized parameters as coordinates makes it easy to solve eq. (4)  the general
solution contains a number of arbitrary functions which depend only on the ratios x/
and 2/, but these ratios are constant along any of the rg trajectories described by eq.
(11), so we can treat them as just being arbitrary constants, which we write as f i
jk. the
solution can then be written, provided x,  and  are non-zero, as

gi
jk =

i
jk f i

jk

(12)

(no summation on i, j, k). with this solution, it is clear that for eq. (5) to be satised
for a trajectory, the following dierences must be constant along the curve:

ij ij = constant,

(13)

it can be seen from the expressions for the components of the levi-civita connection given
in appendix 2 of [6] that this is not true for any of the rg ow lines except the line of
crossover. thus none of the ow lines with , x, and  all non-zero can be auto-parallel
for any connection. when one of x,  or  is 0, the solution (12) has to be changed by
absorbing factors of x/ or 2/ into f i
jk to make it nite, for example if  6= 0 we can
write the solution as
(14)

ij ij = 0 or

with n = 1

x
o
ij ij = 0 respectively, and the only line which
ij ij = 0,
satised if

satises these conditions is x =  = 0. thus none of the other rg ow lines can ever be
auto-parallel. finally, we want to see if the geodesic x =  = 0 is auto-parallel for other
connections (apart from the levi-civita connection). this means we have to see if eq.
(6) is satised by the solution (14). for example, if only f 
xx are non-zero,
eq. (6) becomes

 6= 0 or g

which clearly is satised for x =  = 0. however this is not true for the most general
connection. for example, if gx
 6= 0 then the line of
crossover is not an auto-parallel (since the corresponding levi-civita connection compo-
nents vanish in the large n limit, [7]). the line of crossover is therefore not auto-parallel
for the entire family of connections which can be used in the rg equations, but only for
the class with gx
thus we nd that introducing the family of non-metric compatible connections changes
the conclusions, compared to the the levi-civita case, as to which renormalization group
ow lines are auto-parallel. there is a large class of connections for which the line of
crossover between the gaussian and the wilson-fisher xed points remains auto-parallel,
but this is not true of the most general connection.

our second example of an rg ow shows that, in general, the family of connections do
change the auto-parallel nature of the geodesic ows (in the special cases where rg ow is
geodesic). this is 4-dimensional n = 2 yang-mills theory [9]. the geometrical properties
of this model were investigated in [8] where two possible metrics were considered, and it
was found most of the renormalization group ow lines are not geodesics, but some special
lines are geodesics of both metrics. we now want to see which, if any, of the rg ow lines
are auto-parallel for other connections. the complex coupling  = ef f
is given as
a function of u = u/2, where u = t rh2i parameterizes the symmetry breaking, by

2 + 4i

k

+ 2n

(16)

where k(k2) is a standard elliptic integral [10] with k2 = 2
u+1 and k  = k(1  k2) and n
is an integer. various beta functions for this model have been investigated in [11, 12, 13].
in [13] wilsonian and novikov, shifman, vainshtein, zakharov, [14], beta functions were
considered. here we concentrate on the callan-symanzik beta functions of [11, 12]. the
callan-symanzik beta functions, ~ =  

  are dened by

this beta function represents a vector ow on a manifold, parameterized by  (or u),
which has the topology of a sphere with three punctures. this manifold has three singular
points: u =  (the weak coupling limit) and u = 2 (where there are extra massless
degrees of freedom). the seiberg-witten metric on this manifold in the u-coordinates is

ds2 = 2im( )(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

where i, i = 2, 3, 4 are jacobi -functions, [10].

another metric which can be introduced for this geometry is the poincare metric

ds2 =

1

(im( ))2 d d .

(19)

for both these metrics, the lines of real u and imaginary u are geodesics, but the other
rg ow lines are not [8].

in fact we do not need to know the explicit form of ( ) to see if the geodesics
if we use u and u as coordinates, so that ~ =
u = 0. the solution of eq. (4) is then

will be auto-parallel for any connection:

(20)

the solution contains arbitrary functions of u/u, but these functions are constant along
the radial lines in the u-plane, and we can see from eq. (17) that these are just the rg ow
jkdxjdxk 
lines (in the u-coordinates, u = 2u,  u = 2u). if we assume that g = gi
xi
is a real tensor and substitute this solution into eq. (5) or (6), we can see that those
equations depend only on one function g(u/u):

g(u/u) = gu

uu + gu

uu + gu

uu + gu

g(u/u) = g u

uu + g u

uu + g u

eq. (5) then reduces to the condition that

(23)

since g and g are constant along an rg trajectory, a trajectory can only be auto-parallel
u
for some choice of g and g if the imaginary part of
uu u is constant along that trajectory.
it can be shown numerically that this is only the case for the geodesics, the lines of real
u
uu u is real. all the other rg ow lines are therefore not auto-
and imaginary u, where
parallel for any connection, while the real u line is auto-parallel provided g(1) = g(1) and
the imaginary u line is auto-parallel provided g(1) = g(1). thus the geodesic ow
lines are not auto-parallel for the most general connection (as was the case in the o(n)
model), but they are auto-parallel, for example, if g(u/u) = g(u/u).

since we did not use the explicit expressions for  and  above, this result can be
applied to any theory in which the beta function is an analytic function of one complex
variable only. in the case of n = 2 su(2) yang-mills theory with massless quarks, as
in the pure yang-mills theory, the complex coupling  depends only on u/2. however,
the singularities of the theories with massless quarks are not all on the real or imaginary
u axes - for example, when the number of avours nf = 1, there are singularities at
u = u0 and u = u0ei/3. of course, we cannot tell if these lines are actually auto-
parallel unless we know whether they are geodesics of the seiberg-witten metric, but we
can say that if they are geodesics of the seiberg-witten metric in these models, they be
auto-parallel for connections with g(e2i/3) = g(e2i/3), but not for all connections for
which g(u/u) = g(u/u), as in the case of the pure yang-mills theory.

in conclusion it has been shown that the renormalization group equation for the op-
erator expansion co-ecients gives rise to a family of non-metric compatible connections
which are related to the levi-civita connection by a
bc = 0. in
general rg ows which are geodesic for the levi-civita connection are not auto-parallel
for all members of the family, though in the models examined they are for a large sub-
class of connections (it can be shown that the same is also true for the free eld models
considered in [6]). in none of the examples examined here is it the case that a rg ow line
which is not geodesic under the levi-civita connection is auto-parallel for some member
of the family.
