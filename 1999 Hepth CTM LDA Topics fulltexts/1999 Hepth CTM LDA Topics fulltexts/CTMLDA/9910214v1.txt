abstract

the most general 2+1 dimensional spinning particle model is considered with the conguration
space m5 = r1,2  l where l is a lobachevsky plane being a space of the spinning modes. the
action functional may involve all the possible rst order poincare invariants of m5 world lines, and
the particular class of actions is specied thus the corresponding gauge algebra to be unbroken by
inhomogeneous external elds. nevertheless, the consistency problem reveals itself as a requirement
of the global compatibility between rst and second class constraints. these compatibility condi-
tions, being unnoticed before in realistic second class theories, can be satised for a particle i the
gyromagnetic ratio takes the critical value g = 2. the quantization procedure is suggested for a
particle in the generic background eld by making use of a darboux co-ordinates, being found by a
perturbative expansion in the eld multipoles and the general procedure is described for constructing
of the respective transformation in any order.

1 introduction

it is always a problem to construct consistent interactions for systems which involve higher spins. the
problem appears in any dimension both at level of particles, elds and strings. for the massless case
in low dimensions, the interacting spin elds allow for a uniform description at the level of equations
of motion in the ads space [1, 2]. free massive eld actions have long been known, it is not the case
for interactions. when an action possesses invariance under higher-spin transformations, the reason of
inconsistency is well known - the gauge algebra may be broken down when the interaction deforms theory.
however, the peculiar feature of massive higher spin elds is that they may be formulated as pure second
class constrained theories having no gauge invariance from the very beginning. the example of gauge
noninvariant action was given in ref. [3] for the massive higher spin elds. in this case, the consistency
criteria become less obvious, however one should require at least poincare invariance, renormalizability,
unitarity and possibly somewhat yet unknown. using the action of ref.
[3] the prescription was given
[4, 5] for imposing tree-level unitarity condition on a whole energy spectrum of the compton
in refs.
scattering amplitudes of a single massive higher spin eld. some of coecients in the action were xed
unambiguously, in particular, in a homogeneous e/m eld gyromagnetic ratio takes the value g = 2 [4].

another way to get consistent interacting eld equations is to quantize an appropriate classical me-
chanical model of massive spinning particle which is constructed as a constrained hamiltonian system
with a nite number degrees of freedom. the advantage of the method is that it is simpler to achieve
consistent couplings to backgrounds at the classical level than to examine it in the quantum eld theory.
the reason is that there is only a nite number of gauge symmetries ( rst class constraints ) in the
classical particle description and continuous innity of eld theoretical symmetries are generated from
them through a quantization procedure. in ref. [10] the systematic procedure was developed to construct
the most general action functional ( involving some external parameters ) for a particle of an arbitrary
spin. one may restrict parameters values by appropriate conditions to the special case which admits
consistent interactions with a general background. however, as further will be claried, the consistency

problem is not exhausted by noncontradictory deformation of the gauge algebra. it appears again as a
requirement of global smoothness of equations of motion on the phase space. more precisely, when the
interaction is switching on, the special surface appears where the dirac brackets become singular, and
to make equations of motion regular upon this surface we should to impose some smoothness conditions
restricting the choice of the free parameters in the action. these conditions, being applied for the case
of the homogeneous e/m eld, x the gyromagnetic ratio as g = 2 which is the same value that has been
deduced from the eld theoretical approach [4].

the note is organized as follows. we begin in section 2 with a brief view of the universal model of 3d
particle, being the 3d analog of the model, allowing for the consistent interaction in d=4 [10]. in section
3 the problem of interaction is considered, the singular structure of the phase space is claried, and the
consistency conditions are obtained. in section 4 we turn to quantization of the model and in section
5 we conclude with some general remarks on the perturbative quantization procedure and the global
consistency problem. the appendix is attached with the some details of the geometric constructions.

2 universal 3d spinning particle model

conguration space of 3d spinning particle [8, 9] can be chosen as m5 = r1,2 l, where the lobachevsky
plane l carries spinning degree of freedom a. poincare generators

being functions on the extended phase space t m5 form the algebra with respect to the poisson brackets

pa = pa

ja = abcxbpc + ja

(2.1)

{pa, pb} = 0
{pa, jb} = abccdpd
{ja, jb} = abccdjd

(2.2)

level surface of casimir functions p 2 = m2 and p j = ms xes particles spin and mass parameters
in the space of values (pa, ja). due to commutations relations (2.2) hamiltonian counterparts for the
casimirs on the extended phase space should appear as rst class constraints. existence of two in-
dependent gauge symmetries reveals itself in the form of classical zitterbewegung. when the eect is
presented the particles world-surface is no more straight line but takes topology of cylinder [8]. the same
phenomenon may happened in not only in d=3, but in d=4 [10] and higher dimensional case [13]. to
reduce extra dimensions of the world-surface one should require the gauge symmetries to be dependent
in space-time part of extended phase space

(cid:26) 1xa = 2pa

1pa = 0

(cid:27)  (cid:26) 2xa = ja

2pa = 0

(cid:27)

(2.3)

taking account of casimirs surfaces, the requirement results in pa = m/sja.

to construct the most general action functional [10] we need to subject it to the following natural

conditions:

1) the lagrangian does not contain higher derivatives
2) the action is invariant under reparametrization of particles world-line
3) mass-shell p 2 + m2 = 0 and spin-shell p j  ms = 0 conditions should arise in the theory as

constraints

there are ve true poincare invariants (for denition of na and other notation details, see appendix)

1 = x2
2 = ( xn)2
3 = ( x n)
4 = abc xanb nc
5 = n2

(2.4)

afor the details of inner space geometry and notations to be used in the text see the appendix, more details of this

geometry could be found in [8].

the most general poincare- and reparametrization-invariant action has reads

s = z d (l(i) + )  z d l

(2.5)

(2.6)

satisfying all mentioned conditions for the action to be consistent with interactions one gets the one-
parametric family of the lagrangians

(2.7)

where  = /s. when the parameter  6= 1, the lagrangian possesses two gauge symmetries being
dependent in the space-time part of m5. if  = 1, these gauge symmetries become dependent in the
whole conguration space, and they both reduce to reparametrization invariance only. in what follows
we consider only the case  = 1.

3 interactions

the full description of the most general interacting lagrangian and its constrained hamiltonian analysis
is described in ref. [11]. in this section we examine the case of homogeneous e/m eld:

l = ( xn)(m + e(f n)) + is

z z  zz
1  z z

 e xa(aa + fa + fabnb) + o(e2)

(3.1)

here ,  and  are arbitrary constants. when the eld is homogeneous, the term e xafa does not
contribute to dynamics as it vanishes modulo a total time derivative. the complete set of the constraints
on m8 = t (r1,2)  l reads

ta = pa  mna  e(f n)na + efabnb

(3.2)

their brackets on m8 may be presented in the form

{ta, tb} = abc((1 

me

s

)f c  (

m2
s

+

2me

s

(f n))nc +

me

s

f cknk)  abcn c

(3.3)

the maximal rank of this matrix equals 2 and corresponding null-vectors are nc. thus, in a general
position, there are two second class constraints and one rst class among of ta. as is obvious, the
rank decreases to zero if the r.h.s vanished in (3.3) nc = 0. locally, i.e. on the surface nc = 0, all the
constraints become the rst class. the dirac brackets, being constructed of the second class constraints
in the general position, become singular on this surface that gives rise to the discontinuity in the equations
of motion. to study the dynamics near the singular surface, it is convenient to chose another constraint
basis which is equivalent to the original constraints ta = 0 (3.2), the equivalence immediately follows
from the identity (6.5),

h = p2 + m2 + 2em(f n) + efabpanb
 = (p )  ie(f )

 = (p) + ie(f )

the algebra of these constraints reads

{h, } = 2ie(pn)(f )((1

) +

{h, } = 2ie(pn)(f )((1

(3.8)

(3.9)

denote constraints (, ) = i , i = 1, 2 and co-ordinates on m6 = t (r1,2) as (xa, pb) = a. then dirac
brackets take the form

ab = {a, b}db = {a, b} +

1


{a, i}ij{j, b}

to reduce inner space, from ta = 0 we exclude vector na [11] as

na =

pa

(p2)1/2  e

fabpb
p2 + o(e2)

one can see that tensor ab becomes singular on the surface

  p2  s

f p

(p2)1/2 = 0

(3.10)

(3.11)

(3.12)

thus the phase space m6, being equipped with the bracket tensor ab = {a, b}, is not a smooth
manifold anymore, it is decomposed into 3 parts: m6 = m   m+, where m and m+ are domains
of analiticity of the bracket tensor. these domains are dened by the conditions  < 0 and  > 0
respectively. the equations of motion

a = {a, h} +

1


{a, i}ij{j, h}

(3.13)

may suer from a discontinuity at  = 0. to make the equations of motion smooth one should restrict
dynamics on physical space with the following condition to be satised

{h, i} = ijj + kih

(3.14)

where ij and ki are arbitrary functions. when the condition (3.14) is satised, the singular second
term in (3.13) disappears, at least on shell. for the algebra (3.7-8) this means that parameters take their
critical values  = 0 and  = s/m. the equations of motion become smooth in the whole phase space
m6 and take the well-known lorentz form

xa = 2pa + o(f 2, f, ...)

pa = 2ef abpb + o(f 2, f, ...)

h = p2 + m2 + 2se

(f p)
(p2)1/2 + o(f 2, f, ...) = 0

(3.15)

(3.16)

(3.17)

so far we have considered only the rst order in the charge e but, in the homogeneous eld, the procedure
may be closed in coupling constant. the equations (3.15-17) remain the same and lagrangian takes the
form

l = ( xn)pm2 + 2se(f n) + is

z z  zz
1  z z

 e xaaa

(3.18)

if one calls numerical coecient at the vertex (f j) in lagrangian (3.18) and hamiltonian (3.17) as a
gyromagnetic ratio [12], then one may conclude that the smoothing condition (3.14) xes it as  = 2.

consider the consistency problem (which has been treated above in the framework of the constrained
dynamics) from the viewpoint of the symplectic geometry. symplectic view allows to formulate the
consistency condition directly in the reduced phase space m6. the symplectic 2-form associated to
dirac brackets

 =

(1)abda  db

(3.19)

degenerates on the singular surface  = 0: det  = 2. equations of motion have the form

ab b|h=0 = ah|h=0

and symplectic counterpart for the condition (3.13) reads as

z i

aah|=h=0 = 0

where z i

a are [i] linear independent local null-vectors of the two-form (3.19):

abz b

i |=0 = 0

(3.20)

(3.21)

(3.22)

a are dened by the two-form  regardless to the hamiltonian h. since z i

the vectors z i
a are xed,
relations (3.21) should be treated as restrictions to the admissible form of the hamiltonian. it is the
restriction which xes the gyromagnetic ratio in the case of the particle in external e/m eld.

4 quantization

there exist a good many of dierent methods of quantization of a given constrained system. nevertheless,
it is always a problematic task to quantize when phase space possesses nonlinear poisson brackets. usually,
the quantization procedure is understood in the sense of deformation in plank constant of the classical
brackets to quantum commutators whose rst order term is proportional to the classical ones. this
approach is commonly regarded as practically ineective for the case of general manifold because there
is no representation theory for quantum brackets. the quantization problem is strongly simplied in a
moment if one nds the canonical realization ( darboux co-ordinates ) for the initial classical poisson
brackets. this formal idea takes sensible form when phase space of interacting spinning particle is
considered. the interacting, theory contains coupling constant e and knowing darboux realization for free
particle sector one may look for darboux transformation of initial interacting co-ordinates in the form
of perturbative expansion in coupling constant e. the attempt to construct the transformation in rst
order in e was originally taken in ref. [7] in the framework of a minimal anyon model. below, we develop
the general procedure for constructing of the respective transformation to the darboux coordinates in
any order in charge.

the structure of the proposed perturbation approach is most manifest in terms of symplectic geometry.

in darboux co-ordinates (x, p), 2-form of free case 0 = (e = 0) takes the canonical form

0 = (e = 0)   = dpa  dxa

(4.1)

to nd canonical representation for the interacting 2-form  = (e) we proceed follows: realize the initial
variables  in the interacting theory as perturbation expansions in e of the initial variables of the free
theory 0 and then, making change of variables 0 = 0(x, p), bring  = (e) to the canonical form:

0 = (e)

=(0)

 0 = (e = 0)

0=0(x,p)

 dpa  dxa

(4.2)

in more practical terms the mentioned procedure means the following: starting with a pair of 2-forms,
0 for the free case and  for the interacting one



 = ab(; e)da  db =

ab()da  db

enn

xn=0
0  db
ab(0)da
0

0 = 0

(4.3)

(4.4)

( note that 0(0) in (4.4) and rst term in decomposition (4.3) are the same ) one looks for the solution
(0) of the equation

ab((0))da(0)  db(0) = 0

ab(0)da

0  db
0

(4.5)

5

in the form of the power series in the parameter of the charge e:

a = a(0) =



xn=0

ena

n (0)

substitution of (4.6) to (4.5) leads to

0

ac bc

n + 0

cbac

n + c 0

abc

n = kn(1, ..., n1)

the last equation may be presented in the form

or in a manifest cohomological form

ln 0 = kn(1, ..., n1)

d  (0  n) = kn

(4.6)

(4.7)

(4.8)

(4.9)

where the operator d stands for an exterior derivation. then the local compatibility condition for (4.9)
reads as

d  kn = 0

(4.10)

the condition holds by virtue of darboux theorem. general solution to the equation (4.9) has the form

n = (1

0 )ab(z 1

0

d  c

0 k n

bc(0 ) + bn)

(4.11)

arbitrary functions n, being involved in the general solution, does not contribute the respective two-
form, hence n can be omitted.

consider smooth structure of the mapping (4.6). on the surface  = 0, the 2-form has null-vectors,
therefore the darboux co-ordinates on the map m can not be smoothly continued through  = 0 to
m+. consider the jacobi matrix j a

0 . from the equation (4.5) one may get

b = a/b

det j = r det 0

det 

,

det 0 = 1,

det  = 2

(4.12)

as is seen, the jacobian j has a discontinuity on the singular surface. thus, the perturbative quantisation,
being based on the expansion (4.6) of the darboux coordinates, is able to reect the dynamics in single
part (of the phase manifold) alone of the two ones, m+ or m.

5 concluding remarks

in this paper the new understanding of the consistency is proposed for a massive spinning particles
dynamics in the background eld. to have a consistent dynamics, one should satisfy the following
conditions:

1) to provide a consistent deformation of gauge algebra, in the conventional sense.
2) to make particles dynamics smooth upon the singular surface
the last condition results for gyromagnetic ratio to be g = 2 for the particle. there is some point of
issue in view of the quantization problem. existence of the dirac brackets possessing a local singularity
appears to be unnoticed before in a realistic constrained system and by virtue of the fact all the quanti-
zation prescriptions demand given poisson tensor to be smooth on a whole phase manifold. it is unclear
now how one should proceed to take the proper account of the singular surface in a quantization scheme.
we drop out the singularity problem in the framework of perturbative approach to quantization, consid-
ering it as a rst step towards the globally dened interacting quantum theory. the classical interaction
is seen to be well dened globally i g = 2. mention that in higher dimensions the interaction is well
dened locally for an arbitrary spin massive particle, without any restriction to the giromagnetic ratio
[14] although the global analysis, if it was performed for d > 2 + 1 along the lines of this note, would
probably result in the same critical meaning for g in any dimension.
