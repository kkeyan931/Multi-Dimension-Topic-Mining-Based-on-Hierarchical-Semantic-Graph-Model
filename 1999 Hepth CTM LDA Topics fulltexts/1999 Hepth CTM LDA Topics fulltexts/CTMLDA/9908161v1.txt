abstract

we develop a new systematic approach to quantum eld theory that is designed

to lead to physical states that rapidly converge in an expansion in free-particle fock-

space sectors. to make this possible, we use light-front eld theory to isolate vacuum

eects, and we place a smooth cuto on the hamiltonian to force its free-state matrix

elements to quickly decrease as the dierence of the free masses of the states in-

creases. the cuto violates a number of physical principles of light-front eld theory,

including lorentz covariance and gauge covariance. this means that the operators in

the hamiltonian are not required to respect these physical principles. however, by

requiring the hamiltonian to produce cuto-independent physical quantities and by

requiring it to respect the unviolated physical principles of the theory, we are able to

derive recursion relations that dene the hamiltonian to all orders in perturbation

theory in terms of the fundamental parameters of the eld theory.

we present two applications of this method. first we work in massless 3 theory

in six dimensions. we derive the recursion relations that determine the hamilto-

nian and demonstrate how they are used by computing and analyzing some of its

second- and third-order matrix elements. then we apply our method to pure-glue

quantum chromodynamics. after deriving the recursion relations for this theory, we

approximate all physical states as two-gluon states (thus they are relatively simple

single-glueball states), and use our recursion relations to calculate to second order

ii

the part of the hamiltonian that is required to compute the spectrum. we diag-

onalize the hamiltonian using basis-function expansions for the gluons color, spin,

and momentum degrees of freedom. we examine the sensitivity of our results to the

cuto and use them to analyze the nonperturbative scale dependence of the coupling.

we investigate the eect of the dynamical rotational symmetry of light-front eld

theory on the rotational degeneracies of the spectrum and compare the spectrum to

recent lattice results. finally, we examine our wave functions and analyze the various

sources of error in our calculation.

introduction

the standard model of particle physics represents much of our understanding of

the fundamental forces of nature. this model is based on quantum eld theory; so to

test and improve the model, we must have methods for solving these theories. at the

present time, the most successful and rigorous nonperturbative approach to solving

realistic quantum eld theories is the euclidean lattice formulation. however, this

method has its share of diculties. physical states tend to have very complicated

structures in the lattice approach. multi-particle states and excited states are hard

to simulate on the lattice, as are dynamic processes such as scattering. in addition,

there are signicant sources of error in lattice calculations, including those from nite

lattice spacing, nite spacetime volume, and statistics. it is possible that some of

the eects that are observed when eld theories are simulated on a euclidean lattice

are not features of the eld theories, but rather artifacts of the discretization of

spacetime, the nite spacetime volume, or the unphysical euclidean metric. clearly

other methods for deriving the states of quantum eld theory from rst principles are

required, if not to compete with the lattice, then at least to test it.

in this dissertation we develop a new systematic approach to quantum eld theory

that can lead to physical states that rapidly converge in an expansion in free-particle

1

fock-space sectors (free sectors), and we present two applications of this approach.

for the rst application, we demonstrate how the operators of a theory are calculated

in our approach by calculating and analyzing some matrix elements of the invariant-

mass operator1 (imo) in massless 3 theory in six dimensions.

(we work in six

dimensions so that the theory is asymptotically free.) then we use our method to

calculate part of the imo in pure-glue quantum chromodynamics (qcd), and we

diagonalize it, obtaining glueball states and masses. these calculations appeared

previously in refs.

[1] and [2]. the massless scalar calculation in ref.

[1] was

extended to the massive case by kylin, allen, and perry [3].

the primary motivation for our approach is to force the physical states of a theory

to have a relatively simple structure. we avoid some of the diculties of the euclidean

lattice method by working in the continuum, using a minkowskian metric, without

truncating spacetime. our formalism also has the advantage of being manifestly

boost-invariant. of course our method has its diculties, but they are quite dierent

from those of the lattice. thus our method can complement the lattice approach by

providing us with a very dierent view of the same eld theories.

in the most interesting eld theories, it is unlikely that the physical states can

quickly converge in an expansion in free sectors in an equal-time approach. this

is because in equal-time eld theory, the states often must be built on top of a

complicated vacuum unless the volume of space is severely limited. for this reason,

we work in light-front eld theory (lfft). in lfft, it is possible to force the vacuum

of a theory to be empty by removing from the theory all particles that have zero

1the invariant-mass operator is given by the square of the momentum operator: p p = m2.

see chapter 2, section 2 for more details.

2

longitudinal momentum2. any physical eects of these particles must be incorporated

into the operators of the theory in order to obtain correct physical quantities.

in lfft, the hamiltonian is trivially related to the imo, and it is more natural

to work with the imo because it is manifestly boost-invariant. if the imo satises

three conditions in the basis of free-particle fock-space states (free states), then its

eigenstates will rapidly converge in an expansion in free sectors. first, the diagonal

matrix elements of the imo must be dominated by the free part of the imo. second,

the o-diagonal matrix elements of the imo must quickly decrease as the dierence of

the free masses of the states increases. if the imo satises these rst two conditions,

then each of its eigenstates will be dominated by free-state components with free

masses that are close to the mass of the eigenstate. the third condition on the imo

is that the free mass of a free state must quickly increase as the number of particles

in the state increases. if the imo satises all three conditions, then the number of

particles in a free-state component that dominates an eigenstate will be limited from

above. this means that the imos eigenstates will rapidly converge in an expansion

in free sectors3.

2this is because there are no negative longitudinal momenta and momentum conservation requires

the three-momenta of the constituents of the vacuum to sum to zero.

3there are three subtleties here. the rst subtlety is that the rst and third conditions on the
imo will not be satised for those free states in which many of the particles have negligible center-
of-mass transverse momentum and little or no mass. however, the contributions of these free states
to the physical states in which we are interested are typically suppressed. for example, in qcd
these free states have very large widths in transverse position space and are thus highly suppressed
by connement. in qed, the particles with negligible center-of-mass transverse momentum and no
mass are long-transverse-wavelength photons. these photons decouple from the physical states in
which we are typically interested, e.g. charge-singlet states like hydrogen and positronium. thus the
contributions to these physical states from the free states containing these photons are suppressed.
the second subtlety is that exactly how quickly the imos o-diagonal matrix elements must
decrease and the free mass of a free state must increase are not known. we assume that the rates
that we are able to achieve are sucient. this can be veried by diagonalizing the imo and
examining the rate of convergence of the free-sector expansion of its eigenstates.

the third subtlety is that the coecients of the expansion for highly excited eigenstates may grow

for a number of free sectors and then peak before diminishing and becoming rapidly convergent.

3

to satisfy the rst condition on the imo, we assume that we can derive the imo

in perturbation theory. if this is true, then the couplings are small and the diagonal

matrix elements of the imo are dominated by the free part of the imo. to satisfy the

second condition, we place a smooth cuto on the imo to force its matrix elements to

quickly decrease as the dierence of the free masses of the states increases. once we

have removed the particles with zero longitudinal momentum from the theory, it is

reasonable to expect that the third and nal condition will be satised automatically.

this is because the free-particle dispersion relation of lfft should force the free mass

of a free state to quickly increase as the number of particles in the state increases.

(see appendix a for details.)

by suppressing the matrix elements of the imo that have large changes in free

mass, the cuto regulates the ultraviolet divergences of the theory. unfortunately, it

also violates a number of physical principles of lfft, including lorentz covariance

and gauge covariance. this means that the operators in the imo are not required

to respect these physical principles, and renormalization is not simply a matter of

adjusting a few canonical parameters. the simplest way to systematically determine

the imo in this case is in perturbation theory. in order for a perturbative computation

of the imo to be strictly valid, the theory must be asymptotically free4. if this is

the case, then by requiring the imo to produce cuto-independent physical quantities

and by requiring it to respect the unviolated physical principles of the theory5, we can

derive recursion relations that dene the imo to all orders in perturbation theory in

4our method may work even if the theory is not asymptotically free. for example, it works in

qed because the scale at which the electron charge is large is astronomical.

5some of the physical principles, such as cluster decomposition, are violated in a very specic
manner and can still be used to restrict the form of the imo. however, the restriction in this situation
is always weaker than it would have been had there been no violation of the principle.

terms of the fundamental parameters of the eld theory. if our cuto is large enough,

then the couplings will be small and the perturbative approximation to the imo may

work well.

the physical principles that we use to determine the imo form a subset of the full

set of physical principles of light-front eld theory. this raises the question of how

the remaining principles, which are violated by our cuto, are restored in physical

quantities. since the imo is uniquely determined by the principles that we use, the

remaining principles must be automatically respected by physical quantities derived

from our imo, at least perturbatively.

if they are not, then they contradict the

principles that we use and no consistent theory can be built upon the complete set

of principles. the reason that this process is possible is that there are redundancies

among the various physical principles.

it is possible to compute operators other than the imo in our approach. although

we compute operators perturbatively, we can use these operators to compute nonper-

turbative quantities. for example, the spectrum can be computed by diagonalizing

the imo (see chapter 5, section 4). however, there are drawbacks to computing

operators perturbatively. it is possible that there are intrinsically nonperturbative

eects in the theory that require nonperturbative renormalization. any such eects

are neglected in this approach. another problem is that perturbative renormalization

makes nonperturbative physical quantities somewhat cuto-dependent.

in general, eld theories have an innite number of degrees of freedom. how-

ever, since our imo will cause the physical states of the theory to rapidly converge

in an expansion in free sectors, we can truncate this expansion. this means that

approximate computations of physical quantities will require only a nite number of

5

nite-body matrix elements of operators. in addition, since we assume that we can

compute these matrix elements perturbatively, we do not implement particle creation

and annihilation nonperturbatively in these calculations. this allows us to always

work with a nite number of degrees of freedom.

when we perturbatively calculate matrix elements of operators, we do not trun-

cate the space of intermediate states that can appear; so our approach does not

use a tamm-danco truncation6 [4, 5, 6]. we also do not completely eliminate any

interactions, such as those that change particle number. these strengths of our ap-

proach allow us to better describe physical theories. however, the truncation of the

free-sector expansion of physical states has drawbacks that are similar to those of

perturbative renormalization.

it neglects any physical eects that require an in-

nite number of particles and contributes to the cuto dependence of nonperturbative

physical quantities.

the accuracy of our results and the strength of the cuto dependence of our non-

perturbative physical quantities are determined by the order in perturbation theory

to which we calculate the operators of the theory and the number of free sectors that

we keep in the expansion of physical states. if we use a cuto that is too small, then

the couplings of the theory will be large, and it will be necessary for us to keep many

terms in the expansion of the operators. if we use a cuto that is too large, then

the free-sector expansion of the physical states will converge slowly, and it will be

necessary for us to keep many sectors in the states. we assume that if the order of

6the only degrees of freedom that we remove from the full theory are the particles with zero
longitudinal momentum. we should be able to replace the physical eects of these particles with
interactions without compromising the validity of the theory. this is because these particles are vac-
uum eects or have innite kinetic energies (or both), and thus are not observable in the laboratory
as particles.

6

perturbation theory and the number of free sectors are manageable, then there is a

range of cuto values for which the approximations work well and physical quantities

are relatively accurate and cuto-independent.

as we mentioned, we remove from the theory all particles with zero longitudinal

momentum. we should replace their physical eects with interactions. however,

due to the limitations of our method, we can reproduce only those eects of these

particles that can be derived with perturbative renormalization and a small number

of particles.

the eld theory to which we are most interested in applying our method is qcd,

the fundamental theory of the strong nuclear interactions. there are a number of

approaches that are similar to ours [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], and some of these

methods have been used to calculate the physical states of qcd [14, 15]. these

calculations are based on nonrelativistic approximations and use sharp step-function

cutos. nonrelativistic approximations drastically simplify the diagonalization of the

imo, but are insucient for states containing light quarks or gluons. sharp cutos

prevent the complete cancellation of the infrared divergences that appear in light-front

gauge theories7.

our approach is completely relativistic and uses smooth cutos to ensure the

complete cancellation of the light-front infrared divergences. it is largely based on

the renormalization methods of perry [16], perry and wilson [17], wilson [18], and

g lazek and wilson [7], as well as the hamiltonian-diagonalization methods of wegner

[19].

7these appear due to the exchange of massless gauge particles with arbitrarily small longitudinal

momentum.

to the best of the authors knowledge, this dissertation contains a number of

original contributions:

 a method for deriving recursion relations that uniquely determine the imo (or
equivalently, the hamiltonian) to all orders in perturbation theory in a light-

front eld theory;

 derivations of these recursion relations in massless 3 theory and pure-glue qcd;

to third order in light-front massless 3 theory;

 a computation of the two-gluon to two-gluon matrix element of the renormalized

imo to second order in light-front pure-glue qcd;

 a computation of the pure-glue qcd glueball spectrum in a continuum light-
front approach. (this is the rst continuum relativistic light-front qcd bound-

state calculation.)

this dissertation is organized as follows. each of the chapters and appendices

begins with a brief outline of the material that it contains. in chapter 2 we introduce

lfft and derive the canonical hamiltonians for massless 3 theory in six dimensions

and pure-glue qcd. in chapter 3 we lay the groundwork for our method and derive

the recursion relations that determine the imo in each of the two theories. in chapter

4 we calculate and analyze some of the imos second- and third-order matrix elements

in massless 3 theory. in chapter 5 we calculate part of the pure-glue qcd imo, and

diagonalize it, obtaining glueball states and masses. we conclude with a summary

and a discussion of the direction of future work in chapter 6. in appendix a we

8

give a qualitative argument that shows that in lfft, the free mass of a free state

should rapidly increase with the number of particles in the state. in appendix b we

prove that the transformation that we use to alter the cuto on our imo is unitary.

in appendix c we discuss some of the technical issues involved in the numerical

calculation of the matrix elements that enter our calculation of physical states in

pure-glue qcd.

light-front field theory and canonical

hamiltonians

in this chapter we begin with an introduction to light-front coordinates and a

discussion of some of the special properties of light-front momenta. we then discuss

the nature of the poincare symmetries in lfft. we conclude by deriving the canon-

ical hamiltonians for massless 3 theory in six dimensions and pure-glue qcd. the

reader who is interested in a historical survey of lfft or a more detailed analysis of

its properties is encouraged to consult the recent reviews and introductions [20].

2.1 light-front field theory

2.1.1 light-front coordinates

in 1949, dirac introduced the hamiltonian light-front approach to dynamics as

part of his eort to construct a viable hamiltonian formalism for relativistic systems

[21]. in light-front dynamics in d spacetime dimensions, any d-vector a is written

a = (a+, a,~a),

where in terms of equal-time vector components,

a = a0  ad1,
ai
ei =
~a =

d2

xi=1

aiei,

d2

xi=1

10

(2.1)

(2.2)

and ei is the unit vector pointing along the i-axis8. since a spacetime coordinate is a

d-vector, it is also written this way:

x = (x+, x, ~x).

(2.3)

rewriting the usual d-vectors in this way does not do anything by itself. what

denes light-front dynamics is the choice of x+ as the time coordinate, x as the

longitudinal space coordinate, and ~x as the transverse space coordinate. this

choice means that when we quantize elds in light-front dynamics, we quantize them

at equal light-front time (x+) rather than at equal time (x0). this choice also implies

that the light-front hamiltonian is the operator that evolves states forward in light-

front time. we will see that these dierences have profound eects on the dynamics

of lfft.

if a lfft is to yield the same results as the corresponding equal-time eld theory,

it is necessary for lorentz scalars to agree in the two approaches. since the inner

product in the standard equal-time approach is

a  b = a0b0 

aibi,

d1

xi=1

we nd that in light-front coordinates,

a  b =

1
2

a+b +

1
2

ab+  ~a ~b.

this means that the nonzero components of the metric are

g+ = g+ = 2,

gij = i,j,
8another common convention is a = (a0  ad1)/2.

(2.10)

(2.11)

according to eq. (2.5), the inner product of a momentum and a position is

p  x =

1
2

p+x +

1
2

px+  ~p  ~x.

(2.12)

this implies that the momentum conjugate to x is p+, the momentum conjugate

to x+ is p, and the momentum conjugate to ~x is ~p. since x is the longitudinal

position, we refer to p+ as the longitudinal momentum, and since x+ is the time

coordinate, p is the energy. similarly, since ~x is the transverse position, we refer

12

to ~p as the transverse momentum. for a free particle, p2 = m2. this means that

the kinetic energy of a particle is

p =

~p 2
 + m2

p+

.

(2.13)

2.1.2 special properties of light-front momenta

the behavior of light-front momenta is the source of many of the special properties

of lfft. from

p+ = p0 + pd1 = q~p 2 + m2 + pd1,

(2.14)

we see that every particle has p+  0. since the vacuum has no momentum, and there
are no particles with p+ < 0, the vacuum can only contain particles with p+ = 0.

thus we can remove the eects of the vacuum from the physical states of the theory

by removing from the theory all particles with p+ = 0. this is the rst step in our

eort to construct physical states that have a relatively simple structure.

particles with p+ = 0 are either vacuum eects or have innite kinetic energies

(or both). these particles are not observable in the laboratory; so we should be able

to replace their physical eects by modifying the operators of the theory, without

compromising the validity of the theory. in principle, we should be able to modify

the operators of the theory to include the physical eects of the innite-kinetic-energy

p+ = 0 particles using renormalization. however, there remain two open questions.

first, can this renormalization be done perturbatively, with a nite number of par-

ticles that have p+ > 0? second, what about the physical eects of the p+ = 0

particles that do not have large kinetic energies? it seems unlikely that perturbative

renormalization will yield operators that include these eects. in this dissertation,

we use perturbative renormalization with a nite number of particles and leave any

13

nonperturbative/innite-particle-number renormalization eects for future consider-

ation.

the dispersion relation shows that a particles kinetic energy behaves dierently

under the scaling of transverse and longitudinal momenta. this means that these

momenta must be assigned dierent scaling dimensions [8]. the dispersion relation

also shows that longitudinal locality is violated in lfft (since the longitudinal mo-

mentum appears in the denominator), and thus cannot be used to restrict the form

of the operators of the theory. we will see that our cuto violates transverse locality,

but since this violation is weak, we will be able to use an approximation to transverse

locality to restrict the form of the operators.

2.1.3 poincare symmetries in light-front field theory

the choice of light-front quantization has interesting consequences for the poincare

symmetries in lfft. to analyze these consequences, we compare the canonical def-

initions of the generators of these symmetries in the equal-time and light-front ap-

proaches. we consider the case of scalar eld theory for simplicity and the case of

d = 4 dimensions for physical realism.

the energy-momentum tensor is dened in terms of the lagrangian l by

t  =

l
()

   gl =   gl.

(2.15)

in equal-time eld theory, the generator of translations along the -axis is ( =

0, 1, 2, 3)

p  = z d3xt 0.

(2.16)

p 0 is the hamiltonian. the angular-momentum tensor is

14

j  = z d3xhxt 0  xt 0i ,

in terms of which the generator of boosts along the i-axis is (i = 1, 2, 3)

and the generators of rotations are

ki = j 0i,

j1 = j 23,
j2 = j 31,
j3 = j 12,

(2.17)

(2.18)

(2.19)

where ji generates rotations of the system around the i-axis.

notice that the only component of the energy-momentum tensor that appears

in j  and contains the interaction (which is in l) is t 00. this means that the
hamiltonian and the boost generators move states o the quantization surface x0 = 0.

for this reason, they are called dynamic operators. the rotation generators do not

move states o the quantization surface and are said to be kinematic operators.

in lfft, the generator of translations along the -axis is9 ( = +,, 1, 2)

p  =

1

2 z d2xdxt +.

the angular-momentum tensor is

j  =

1

2 z d2xdxhxt +  xt +i .

(2.20)

(2.21)

9although we speak of translations along the longitudinal axis x, longitudinal position is not an
observable quantity in light-front dynamics and wave packets cannot be localized in x [22]. this
is related to the fact that p+  0.

15

the lorentz generators that are contained within j  are divided into the light-front
boost generators:

b1 = j +1,
b2 = j +2,
1
2j +,
k3 = 

and the light-front rotation generators:

f1 = j 1,
f2 = j 2,
j3 = j 12.

(2.22)

(2.23)

b1 and b2 are the generators of boosts along the 1-axis and the 2-axis respectively.
under these transverse boosts, each particles transverse momentum (whether the

particle is composite or point-like) transforms according to

~p  ~p + p+~v,

(2.24)

where ~v is a boost parameter [22, 23]. k3 is the generator of boosts along the 3-
axis, just as in equal-time eld theory. in lfft this boost is called a longitudinal

boost. under a longitudinal boost, each particles longitudinal momentum transforms

according to

p+  ep+,

(2.25)

where  is a boost parameter.

in lfft, the only component of the energy-momentum tensor that appears in

j  and contains the interaction is t +. this means that the transverse boost

16

generators are kinematic. the longitudinal boost generator is dynamic in general.

however, under a boost along the 3-axis, the light-front time variable is transformed

according to

x+  x+e.

(2.26)

this means that the longitudinal boost generator shifts states o the quantization

surface x+ = constant only if the constant is nonzero. to force k3 to be kinematic,
we use x+ = 0 as our quantization surface.

f1 and f2 are dynamic operators and generate rotations of the quantization sur-
face x+ = 0 around the surface of the light cone x2 = 0 [22]. j3 is the generator of
rotations about the 3-axis and is kinematic, just as in equal-time eld theory.

the dierences in the lorentz generators in equal-time and light-front eld the-

ories have important implications for the construction and classication of physical

states. in general, we would like to solve for states as functions of their momenta

and classify them according to their mass and spin, as well as their transformation

properties under parity and charge conjugation. in equal-time eld theory, it is dif-

cult to solve for states as functions of their momenta because the boost generators

are dynamic. on the other hand, classifying states is straightforward because the

rotation generators, the parity operator, and the charge conjugation operator are all

kinematic.

in lfft with the quantization surface x+ = 0, it is simple to solve for states as

functions of their momenta since boosts are kinematic. however, classifying states

is very dicult because rotations and parity are dynamic. (parity interchanges the

light-front time and longitudinal-space coordinates.) it is straightforward to partially

classify states in lfft since charge conjugation and rotations about the 3-axis are

17

kinematic, but for a complete classication, we must either compare theoretical re-

sults to experimental data or diagonalize the rotation generators and parity operator

in addition to the imo to compute their simultaneous eigenstates. comparing our

theoretical results to experimental data is tricky because when we make approxima-

tions, such as renormalizing perturbatively or truncating the free-sector expansion

of states, we disrupt the properties of the states under dynamic symmetry transfor-

mations. on the other hand, computing simultaneous eigenstates of the imo, the

rotation generators, and the parity operator is expected to be much more dicult

than diagonalizing the imo alone.

2.2 the canonical hamiltonians

in this section, we simultaneously derive the canonical hamiltonians for massless

3 theory and pure-glue qcd. for massless 3 theory we work in d = 6 dimensions

so that the theory is asymptotically free, and for pure-glue qcd we work in d = 4

dimensions.

the canonical lagrangian density for massless scalar eld theory with a three-

point interaction is

l =

1

g
3!

the canonical lagrangian density for pure-glue qcd is

l =

(2.29)

greek indices are lorentz indices, cs are color indices, repeated indices are summed

over, and the f s are the su(nc) structure constants. for each theory, we derive the

canonical hamiltonian from l by the following procedure:

1. in pure-glue qcd, we choose the light-cone gauge, a+

c = 0, and derive the

euler-lagrange equation that determines a

c in terms of ~ac.

2. using the canonical procedure and treating the eld classically (i.e.

letting

it and its derivatives commute), we derive the hamiltonian in terms of  in

massless 3 theory and in terms of ~ac in pure-glue qcd, dropping terms that

are zero if the eld is zero at spacetime innity.

3. we quantize the eld by expanding it in terms of free-particle creation and

annihilation operators. (we dene the eld expansions below.)

4. in each term in the hamiltonian, we treat the creation and annihilation opera-

tors as if they commute and move all the creation operators to the left of all the

annihilation operators. (this normal ordering drops some constants in both

theories and the so-called self-inertias in pure-glue qcd.)

5. we drop the terms in the hamiltonian that have no eect if there are no particles

with p+ = 0.

we work in the schrodinger representation, where operators are time-independent

and states are time-dependent. thus we quantize the eld by dening it to be a su-

perposition of solutions to the klein-gordon equation (since the particles are bosons),

with the quantization surface x+ = 0. in massless 3 theory, we use

(x, ~x) = z d1ha1eip1x + a

1eip1xi x+=0

,

(2.30)

si is the spin polarization of particle i, and the gluon polarization vector is dened

in massless 3 theory,  = 0 and spin and color degrees of freedom are ignored in

all quantities (such as di). the purpose of  is to regulate divergent eects from

exchanged gluons (either instantaneous or real) with innitesimal longitudinal mo-

mentum. we take   0 before we calculate physical quantities (see chapter 5).

in the course of deriving the canonical hamiltonian in pure-glue qcd, it is nec-

essary to take the inverse longitudinal derivative of the gluon eld. we do this by

moving the derivative inside the eld expansion:

chapter 3

the method for computing free-state
matrix elements of the invariant-mass

operator

in this chapter we lay the groundwork for our method for computing the imo

of a eld theory, and we derive the recursion relations that uniquely determine the

imo in each of the theories that we consider. after dening the action of our cuto,

we place a number of restrictions on the imo. first we force the imo at a given

cuto to be unitarily equivalent to itself at a higher cuto. this implies that the

imo is unitarily equivalent to itself at an innite cuto, and will therefore yield

cuto-independent physical quantities. from the statement of unitary equivalence,

we develop a perturbative series that relates the interactions at two dierent cutos.

we then proceed to use physical principles to restrict the form of the imo. we require

it to conserve momentum and to be invariant under boosts and rotations about the

3-axis. although our cuto violates exact transverse locality, we are able to require

the imo to respect an approximate transverse locality. in practice this means that

the imos matrix elements are analytic functions of transverse momenta. the cuto

also violates cluster decomposition, but we show that the implications of this violation

are simple enough that we can still use this principle to restrict the form of the imo.

25

we show that in each of the theories that we consider that the imo must become

the free imo in the noninteracting limit, and it must be a function only of the cuto

and the coupling. the nal physical restriction on the imo is that it must reproduce

the perturbative scattering amplitudes of the appropriate theory. this restriction

species the form of the low-order interactions in each theory that we consider.

we use the restrictions from physical principles and the perturbative series that

relates the interactions at two dierent cutos to derive the recursion relations that

determine the imo. a crucial step in this process is the removal of the coupling from

the perturbative series. this allows us to separate the cuto dependences of the

operators in the interaction from the cuto dependences of their couplings.

3.1 the cuto

the imo is a function of the cuto, and can be split into the canonical free imo

and an interaction:

m2() = m2

free + m2

int().

(3.1)

at this point the interaction is undened. to force the o-diagonal matrix elements

of the imo to decrease quickly for increasingly dierent free masses, we regulate it

by suppressing its matrix elements between states that dier in free mass by more

than the cuto:

hf|m2()|ii = hf|m2

free |ii + hf|m2

2

int()|ii
4 hf| v ()|ii ,

f i

= m 2

f hf|ii + e

(3.2)

where |fi and |ii are eigenstates of the free imo with eigenvalues m 2
f i is the dierence of these eigenvalues:

f and m 2

i , and

26

f i = m 2

f  m 2
i .

(3.3)

v () is the interaction with the gaussian factor removed, and we refer to it as

the reduced interaction. to determine the imo, we must determine the reduced

interaction.

we will see that hf| v ()|ii does not grow exponentially as 2

f i gets large; so

the exponential in eq. (3.2) forces the o-diagonal matrix elements of the imo to

rapidly diminish as 2

f i grows. this satises the second of our three conditions on

the imo and regulates it.

3.2 the restriction to produce cuto-independent physical

quantities

unfortunately, any regulator in hamiltonian lfft breaks lorentz covariance, and

in gauge theories it also breaks gauge covariance10. this means that the operators in

the imo are not required to respect these physical principles. instead, the imo must

be allowed to contain all operators that are consistent with the unviolated physical

principles of the theory.

in addition, since there is no locality in the longitudinal

direction in lfft, these operators can contain arbitrary functions of longitudinal

momenta.

to uniquely determine the operators that the imo can contain, as well as the

coecients of these operators, we place a number of restrictions on the imo. the

rst restriction is that it has to produce cuto-independent physical quantities. we

impose this restriction by requiring the imo to satisfy

10our regulator breaks these symmetries because the mass of a free state is neither gauge-invariant

nor rotationally invariant (except for rotations about the 3-axis).

27

m2() = u(, c) m2(c) u (, c),

(3.4)

where c > 1 and is otherwise arbitrary, and u is a unitary transformation that

changes the imos cuto. note that we are considering m2() to be a function of
its argument; i.e. m2(c) has the same functional dependence on c that m2()
has on .

to see that eq. (3.4) implies that the imo will produce cuto-independent phys-

ical quantities, note that the imo on the right-hand side (rhs) of the equation can

be replaced by iterating the equation:

m2() = u(, c) m2(c) u (, c)

= hu(, c) u(c, c2)i m2(c2)hu (c, c2) u (, c)i
= hu(, c)u(c, c2)u(c2, c3)im2(c3)hu (c2, c3)u (c, c2)u (, c)i
...

.

(3.5)

therefore, since c > 1, eq.

(3.4) implies that m2() is unitarily equivalent to
lim m2(). this means that m2() will produce cuto-independent physical
quantities11.

for simplicity, we dene

 = c,

(3.6)

and then eq. (3.4) takes the form

11if the couplings in m2() diverge as   , then this argument cannot be used in perturbation
theory. this is why we assume that the theory is asymptotically free. on the other hand, if the
couplings are small until the cuto is astronomical, as in qed, then we can use perturbation theory
to prove that the imo at a cuto of physical relevance is unitarily equivalent to itself at a huge
cuto, and will thus produce physical quantities that are almost cuto-independent.

28

m2() = u(, ) m2() u (, ).

(3.7)

to calculate the imo perturbatively, we need to implement this equation per-

turbatively. in our approach, the cuto that regulates an imo also serves to dene

the scale for the couplings that appear in the imo; so the couplings in m2() are
dened at the scale . to use eq. (3.7) perturbatively, we have to perturbatively

relate the couplings at the scale  to the couplings at the scale . this perturbative

relationship is well-dened only if  is not very large compared to  [24]. to fulll

this requirement and eq. (3.6) (recall that c > 1), we choose  to satisfy

 <  < 2.

(3.8)

to make eq. (3.7) a complete statement, we have to dene the unitary transfor-

mation. the transformation is designed to alter the cuto implemented in eq. (3.2),

and is a simplied version of a transformation introduced by wegner [19], modied

for implementation with the imo. the transformation is uniquely dened by a linear

rst-order dierential equation:

du(, )

d(4)

= t ()u(, ),

with one boundary condition:

u(, ) = 1.

(3.9)

(3.10)

we show in appendix b that u(, ) is unitary as long as t () is anti-hermitian

and linear. we dene

t () = hm2

free,m2()i ,

29

(3.11)

which is anti-hermitian and linear. the transformation introduced by wegner uses

t () = hm2

d(),m2()i ,

(3.12)

d() is the part of m2() that is diagonal in the free basis. (it includes the
where m2
diagonal parts of all interactions.) our transformation regulates changes in eigenval-

ues of m2

free, and wegners transformation regulates changes in eigenvalues of m2

d().
to solve for m2() perturbatively, we need to turn eq. (3.7) into a perturbative
restriction on the reduced interaction, v (). we begin by taking the derivative of

eq. (3.7):

dm2()
d(4)

= hhm2

free,m2()i ,m2()i ,

(3.13)

where eq. (3.9) and its adjoint and eq. (3.11) are used12. since the free part of the

imo commutes with itself and is independent of the cuto,

dm2
int()
d(4)

= hhm2

free,m2

int()i ,m2()i .

(3.14)

we assume that m2() can be written as a convergent (or at least asymptotic)

expansion in powers of m2

int():



xa=0v (a),

(3.15)

m2() =
int()]a(cid:17), v (0) = m2

where v (a) is o(cid:16)[m2
v (a)s. substituting eq. (3.15) into eq. (3.14), matching powers of m2
sides, and doing some algebra yields

free, and we must determine the higher-order

int() on both

dv (a)
d(4)

=

a

xb=1hhm2

free,v (b)i ,v (ab)i ,

(3.16)

12the restrictions that we place on the imo in the next section prohibit m2() from depending

on ; so dm2()/d = 0.

30

int()]a(cid:17)
where the sum is zero if a = 0. this equation tells us how the o(cid:16)[m2
contribution to m2() depends on the cuto in terms of lower-order contributions,
and can be used to iteratively calculate m2() in powers of m2

int().

taking a matrix element of eq. (3.16) between free states |ii and |fi for the case

a = 1, we obtain

(3.17)

(3.18)

(3.19)

dv (1)
d(4)

f i

= v (1)

f i 2

f i.

solving this equation with the boundary condition

m2() = = m2()

leads to

f i = exp(cid:20)(cid:18) 1
v (1)
int() is regulated such that m2

f i 4), which

matrix elements of eq.

the higher-order v (a)s can be found the same way that v (1) was found: by taking
(3.16) and using the lower-order v (a)s and the boundary
condition, eq. (3.18). when products of m2
int() are encountered, complete sets of
free states have to be inserted between adjacent factors. the v (a)s that result from
this procedure are all proportional to exp(2
f i4), which shows that u(, ) does
indeed take an imo with a cuto  and produce one with a cuto .

if one computes v (2) and v (3), then eq. (3.15) gives m2() in terms of m2

int()

to o(cid:16)[m2

3.3 restrictions from physical principles

eq. (3.21) is the rst restriction on the imo. to uniquely determine the imo, we

need to place additional restrictions on it, and we do this using the physical principles

of the theory that are not violated by the cuto. (see footnote 5.)

3.3.1 symmetry principles

any lfft should exhibit manifest momentum conservation, boost covariance,

and covariance under rotations about the 3-axis. our cuto does not violate any of

these principles; so we restrict the imo to conserve momentum and to be invariant

under boosts and rotations about the 3-axis.

3.3.2 transverse locality

ideally, the imo should be local in the transverse directions, and thus each of its

matrix elements should be expressible as a nite series of powers of transverse mo-

menta with expansion coecients that are functions of longitudinal momenta. in our

case, the cuto suppresses interactions that have large transverse-momentum transfers

and replaces them with interactions that have smaller transverse-momentum trans-

fers. this is equivalent to suppressing interactions that occur over small transverse

separations and replacing them with interactions that occur over larger transverse

separations; so we do not expect our interactions to be perfectly transverse-local.

nonetheless, we expect that interactions in m2() should appear local relative to
transverse separations larger than 1 or, equivalently, to transverse momenta less

than . this means that for transverse momenta less than  we should be able to

approximate each matrix element of m2() as a nite power series in ~p/. we
enforce this by assuming that transverse locality is violated in the weakest manner

possible, i.e. that any matrix element of the imo can be expressed as an innite

series of powers of transverse momenta with an innite radius of convergence.

in

other words, we assume that the matrix elements of the imo are analytic functions

of transverse momenta.

3.3.3 cluster decomposition

cluster decomposition is a physical principle of lfft that is partially violated

by our cuto; however, we can identify the source of the violation and still use the

principle to restrict the imo. to see how to do this, we consider a generic lfft in

d spacetime dimensions. let us call the particles of this theory  particles. each of

these particles has a momentum degree of freedom that we label with the index p

and a set of discrete quantum numbers that we label with the index a. we denote

the complete set of quantum numbers of particle i by qi:

qi = {pi, ai}.

(3.26)

momentum conservation implies that any matrix element of the reduced interac-

tion can be written as a sum of terms, with each term containing a unique prod-

uct of momentum-conserving delta functions. for example, in our generic lfft,

h34| v ()|12i can be written in the form
h34| v ()|12i = hnd(p+

+ hnd p+
+ hnd p+

1 + p+
1 (d1)(p1  p3)ihnd p+
1 (d1)(p1  p4)ihnd p+

2 )(d1)(p1 + p2  p3  p4)i f (1)(q1, q2, q3, q4, )
2 (d1)(p2  p4)i f (2)(q1, q2, q3, q4, )
2 (d1)(p2  p3)i f (3)(q1, q2, q3, q4, ).

(3.27)

we have included a factor of nd and a longitudinal momentum factor with each

delta function because our normalization of states produces these factors naturally.

34

cluster decomposition implies that the f (i)s in eq.

(3.27) cannot contain delta

functions of momenta [25]. it also implies that each term in eq. (3.27) has exactly one

delta function associated with the conservation of momenta of interacting particles,

with any additional delta functions associated with the conservation of momenta

of spectators. this means that the rst term on the rhs of eq.

(3.27) is the

contribution from four interacting particles, and the second term on the rhs can have

two contributions: one for which 1 and 3 are spectators, and one for which 2 and

4 are spectators. similarly, the third term on the rhs can have two contributions:

one for which 1 and 4 are spectators, and one for which 2 and 3 are spectators.

normally, contributions to matrix elements depend on spectators only through

quantum-number-conserving delta functions (dirac delta functions for continuous

quantum numbers and kronecker deltas for discrete quantum numbers) and the cor-

responding factors of longitudinal momenta, in which case we can write

h34| v ()|12i = hnd(p+
1 + p+
1 (d1)(p1  p3)ihnd p+
+ hnd p+
+ a2,a4f (2,2)(q1, q3, )o +hnd p+
 na1,a4f (3,1)(q2, q3, ) + a2,a3f (3,2)(q1, q4, )o ,

2 )(d1)(p1 + p2  p3  p4)i f (1)(q1, q2, q3, q4, )
2 (d1)(p2  p4)ina1,a3f (2,1)(q2, q4, )
2 (d1)(p2  p3)i
1 (d1)(p1  p4)ihnd p+

(3.28)

where we explicitly show the contributions from dierent sets of spectators and the

kronecker deltas that conserve their discrete quantum numbers. however, we use a

cuto on dierences of free masses of states, and this cuto violates cluster decom-

position. to see this, note that the change in free mass for some process |ii  |fi
is

f i = p +
xj

p

i 
 ,

p 

j xi

35

(3.29)

where the pis are the momenta of the particles in |ii, the p
particles in |fi, and p + is the total longitudinal momentum of each state. the minus
momenta of any spectators cancel in this dierence, but their longitudinal momenta

js are the momenta of the

still contribute to the overall factor of p +. thus our cuto partially violates the

cluster decomposition principle, such that the f (i,j)s in eq. (3.28) can depend on

p +, the total longitudinal momentum of each state:

1 + p+
1 (d1)(p1  p3)ihnd p+

h34| v ()|12i = hnd(p+
+ hnd p+
+ a2,a4f (2,2)(q1, q3, p +, )o +hnd p+
1 (d1)(p1  p4)ihnd p+
 na1,a4f (3,1)(q2, q3, p +, ) + a2,a3f (3,2)(q1, q4, p +, )o .

2 )(d1)(p1 + p2  p3  p4)i f (1)(q1, q2, q3, q4, )
2 (d1)(p2  p4)ina1,a3f (2,1)(q2, q4, p +, )
2 (d1)(p2  p3)i

(3.30)

the result of this analysis can be used to formulate a general restriction on the

imo. when any of the imos matrix elements is written as an expansion in the pos-

sible products of momentum-conserving delta functions, the coecient of any term

in the expansion is restricted as follows. (if there is more than one possible set of

spectators for a given product of momentum-conserving delta functions, then the co-

ecient, e.g. f (2) in eq. (3.27), has to be broken into a distinct part for each possible

set, and these restrictions hold for each part separately.) it can depend on the cuto,

the quantum numbers of the interacting particles, and the total longitudinal momen-

tum. it must be proportional to a quantum-number-conserving kronecker delta for

each discrete quantum number for each spectator. it can have no other dependence

on the quantum numbers of spectators, and it cannot contain delta functions that x

momenta.

36

it is worth mentioning that if one uses a cuto on free masses of states rather

than dierences of free masses, then the coecients of the delta-function expansion

can be functions of all the momenta in the matrix element, which is a signal of a

much more severe violation of cluster decomposition.

if one uses a cuto on free

energy dierences, then the factor of p + in eq. (3.29) is not present and cluster

decomposition is not violated at all. however, longitudinal boost covariance is lost in

this case because energy dierences are not invariant under longitudinal boosts. it is

possible to use cutos that maintain both cluster decomposition and boost covariance

[11], but these complicate the process for computing the imo and do not seem to

provide any signicant advantages.

3.3.4 representation of the theory of interest

the preceding restrictions on m2() are valid for any lfft in more than two
dimensions. in order to represent a particular theory, we must place additional re-

strictions on m2().

we assume that we can compute the imo perturbatively, which means that we

can expand v () in powers of the couplings at the scale . our cuto has no eect

in the noninteracting limit; so our imo must reproduce free eld theory in this limit.

according to eq. (3.2), this means that v () vanishes in the noninteracting limit.

in both theories that we are considering, the only fundamental parameter is a

single coupling; so we require the imo to depend only on it and the scale. (for an

example of the application of our method to a theory with more than one parameter,

see ref. [3].) in this case, the expansion of v () takes the form

v () =



xr=1

v (r)(),
gr

37

(3.31)

where g is the coupling at the scale . we refer to v (r)() as the o(gr
interaction, although for convenience the coupling is factored out.

) reduced

g is the correct fundamental parameter for a theory if and only if its denition is

consistent with the canonical denition of the coupling. the canonical denition in

massless 3 theory is

g = hnd p+

1 (d1)(p1  p2  p3)i1

h23|m2 |1i .

(3.32)

in this theory we choose

g = hnd p+
= hnd p+

1 (d1)(p1  p2  p3)i1
1 (d1)(p1  p2  p3)i1

h23| m2()|1i ~p2=~p3; p+
h23| v ()|1i ~p2=~p3; p+

2 =p+

3

2 =p+

3

.

(3.33)

in pure-glue qcd, the canonical denition of the coupling is

g = hnd p+

1 (d1)(p1  p2  p3) <| g2g3|v|g1>| i1

hg2g3|m2 |g1i .

(3.34)

the denominator removes all dependence on momentum, spin, and color in the canon-

ical matrix element for gluon emission, and thus isolates the coupling. for this theory

we choose

g = (cid:26)hnd p+
=(cid:26)hnd p+

hg2g3|m2()|g1i(cid:27)sn=1; cn=n; =0

~p2=~p3; p+

2 =p+

3

hg2g3| v ()|g1i(cid:27)sn=1; cn=n; =0

~p2=~p3; p+

2 =p+

3

, (3.35)

1 (d1)(p1  p2  p3) <| g2g3|v|g1>| i1

1 (d1)(p1  p2  p3) <| g2g3|v|g1>| i1

where n = 1, 2, 3.

note that in each theory, momentum conservation and boost invariance imply

that the matrix elements that dene the coupling can depend only on the transverse

momentum of particle 2 in the center-of-mass frame and the ratio p+

2 /p+

1 . the re-

strictions ~p2 = ~p3 and p+

2 = p+

3 x these quantities to be 0 and 1/2, respectively.

38

in each case, our denition of the coupling is consistent with the canonical denition

because the conditions on the matrix elements in eqs.

(3.33) and (3.35) have no

eect on the right-hand sides of eqs. (3.32) and (3.34), and these conditions do not

force h23|m2 |1i or hg2g3|m2 |g1i to vanish. according to eq. (3.31), m2() is
coupling coherent [16, 17, 26] in each theory because the couplings of its noncanonical

operators are functions only of the fundamental parameters of the theory and they

vanish in the noninteracting limit.

we have assumed that the imo obeys approximate transverse locality, which

means that we can expand any matrix element hf| v (r)()|ii in powers of trans-
verse momenta. each term in this expansion is either cuto-dependent or cuto-

independent. we dene v (r)

cd() to be the cuto-dependent part of v (r)(), i.e. the

part that produces the cuto-dependent terms in transverse-momentum expansions

of matrix elements of v (r)(). we dene v (r)
ci

to be the cuto-independent part

of v (r)(), i.e. the part that produces the cuto-independent terms in transverse-

momentum expansions of matrix elements of v (r)(). then

v (r)() = v (r)

cd() + v (r)
ci .

(3.36)

this separation is necessary because the procedures for computing v (r)

cd() and v (r)

ci

if m2() is to reproduce the second-order scattering amplitudes of massless 3
theory, then it is necessary and sucient for the reduced interaction to satisfy the fol-

lowing conditions13. first, we prohibit v (r)() from having a three-point interaction

unless r is odd. second, we require

13a proof of this statement exists, but the proof is tedious and is awkward to t into our presen-

tation; so we omit it.

the presence of  in these step-function cutos ensures that we will avoid divergences

from exchanged gluons (either instantaneous or real) with innitesimal longitudinal

momentum. in chapter 5 we show how we can take  to zero before we diagonalize

m2().

we have not yet proved that the above conditions on the reduced interaction

are necessary and sucient to reproduce the perturbative scattering amplitudes of

pure-glue qcd.

41

3.4 the recursion relations for the invariant-mass opera-

tor

in each of the theories that we are considering, the restrictions that we have placed

on the imo are sucient to allow us to derive recursion relations that determine the

imo to all orders in perturbation theory. in this section, we derive these recursion

relations. we want to again point out that the restrictions that we have placed

on the imo are based on a subset of the physical principles of the theory. the

remaining principles, such as lorentz covariance and gauge covariance (in a gauge

theory), must be automatically respected by physical quantities derived from our

imo, at least perturbatively. if they are not, then they contradict the principles we

use and no consistent theory can be built upon the complete set of principles. the

reason that this process is possible is that there are redundancies among the various

physical principles.

in pure-glue qcd for example, gauge covariance is related to

our requirements that the imo produce the perturbative scattering amplitudes of

pure-glue qcd and be a function only of g and .

3.4.1 removal of the coupling

to begin, we consider the restriction that forces the imo to produce cuto-

independent physical quantities:

v ()  v () = v.

(3.43)

this restriction is in terms of the reduced interaction and the change to the reduced

interaction. to derive the recursion relations, we need to remove the coupling from

this equation. to do this, we note that since v () can be expanded in powers of g ,

so can v :

42

v =



xt=2

 v (t).
gt

(3.44)

we refer to v (t) as the o(gt
venience the coupling is factored out. note that v (t) is a function of  and .

 ) change to the reduced interaction, although for con-

now eq. (3.43) can be expanded in powers of g and g :



xt=1

v (t)() 
gt



xt=1

 v (t)() =
gt



xt=2

 v (t).
gt

(3.45)

this equation is a bit tricky to use because it involves the couplings at two dierent

scales. to see how they are related, consider massless 3 theory. the matrix element

of eq. (3.43) for 1  23 is

h23| v ()|1i  h23| v () |1i = h23| v |1i .

(3.46)

according to the denition of the coupling, this equation implies that

g  g = hnd p+

1 (d1)(p1  p2  p3)i1

h23| v |1i ~p2=~p3; p+

2 =p+

3

.

(3.47)

since v (1) changes particle number by 1,

inspection of eq.

(3.22) reveals that

h23| v |1i is o(g3

 ); so

g = g + o(g3
 ).

(3.48)

the same analysis can be done in pure-glue qcd, and it also leads to eq. (3.48).

thus in each theory,

g = g +



xs=3

 cs(, ),
gs

(3.49)

where the css are functions of  and . for an integer t  1, eq. (3.49) implies
that

43

gt
 = gt

 +



xs=2

gt+s
 bt,s(, ),

(3.50)

where the bt,ss are also functions of  and , and can be calculated in terms of the

css by raising eq. (3.49) to the tth power.

we substitute eq. (3.50) into eq. (3.45) and demand that it hold order-by-order

in g . at o(gr

 ) (r  1), this implies that

v (r)()  v (r)() = v (r) 

r1

xs=2

brs,sv (rs)(),

(3.51)

where v (1) = 0, and we dene any sum to be zero if its upper limit is less than

its lower limit. the cuto-independent parts of v (r)() and v (r)() cancel on the

left-hand side (lhs), leaving

v (r)
cd()  v (r)

cd() = v (r) 

r1

xs=2

brs,sv (rs)().

(3.52)

this equation can be used to derive the desired recursion relations.

3.4.2 the recursion relation for the cuto-dependent part of the re-

duced interaction

we rst compute the recursion relation for the cuto-dependent part of the re-

duced interaction. in each theory that we consider, we already know the rst-order

reduced interaction [see eqs. (3.37) and (3.38)]; so we need to compute v (r)

cd for r  2,

in terms of the lower-order reduced interactions.

recall that momentum conservation implies that any matrix element of v ()

can be written as an expansion in unique products of momentum-conserving delta

functions. this means that an arbitrary matrix element of eq. (3.52) can be expanded

in products of delta functions:

44

xi hf| v (r)

cd()|ii(i) xi hf| v (r)

cd() |ii(i)

= xi "hf| v (r) |ii 

r1

xs=2

brs,s hf| v (rs)()|ii#

(i)

,

(3.53)

where the (i) superscripts denote that we are considering the ith product of delta func-

tions that can occur in a delta-function expansion of hf| v (r)()|ii. this equation
is equivalent to a set of equations, one for each possible product of delta functions:

r1

cd()|ii(i)  hf| v (r)
brs,s hf| v (rs)()|ii#(i)

hf| v (r)
xs=2



cd() |ii(i) = "hf| v (r) |ii

.

(3.54)

product, and f (i)

cd({pn},{an}, ) is a function of the cuto and the quantum numbers
of the particles in the matrix element, but does not contain delta functions that x

momenta. we dene npart to be the number of particles in state |ii plus the number of
particles in state |fi, and n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , npart. here pn is the momentum of particle
n and an is its set of discrete quantum numbers: an = {sn, cn} in pure-glue qcd, and
an is the null set in massless 3 theory. we dene n (i)
int to be the number of particles

in the matrix element that participate in an interaction for the ith product of delta

functions. in order for the imo to have the dimensions (mass)2, f (i)
cd must have the
int in massless 3 theory and b(i) = 4  n (i)
dimensions (mass)b(i), where b(i) = 6  2n (i)

in pure-glue qcd. note that we are suppressing the dependence of the rhs of eq.

(3.55) on r.

we have assumed that any matrix element of the imo can be expanded in powers

of transverse momenta, not including the momentum-conserving delta functions; so

f (i)

cd({pn},{an}, ) = b(i) x{mnt}

sum is over all values of each of the mnts, subject to the constraint that

b(i) xn,t

mnt 6= 0,

(3.57)

which is necessary to avoid terms in the expansion that are cuto-independent. the

z{mnt}

i

s are the coecients for the momentum expansion. they depend on the mnts

and are functions of the particles longitudinal momenta and discrete quantum num-

since the rhs of eq. (3.54) has the same product of delta functions as the lhs,

we can write

3.4.3 the recursion relation for the cuto-independent part of the re-

duced interaction

to complete the solution for the imo, we need to specify how to compute the

cuto-independent part of the reduced interaction. in massless 3 theory, we have

specied v (1); so we need to determine v (r)
ci

for r  2. in pure-glue qcd, we have
for r  3. before we derive
the recursion relation, we rst consider which contributions to v (r)() can be cuto-

ci ; so we need to determine v (r)

specied v (1) and v (2)

ci

independent.

a matrix element of the cuto-independent part of v (r)() can be expanded in

products of delta functions and in powers of transverse momenta just as was done for

the cuto-dependent part. thus we can write

hf| v (r)

ci |ii = xi hf| v (r)

,

(3.69)

(3.70)

eq. (3.70) ensures that all the terms in the expansion of f (i)

ci are cuto-independent.

eq. (3.70) places constraints on the possible cuto-independent contributions to

the reduced interaction. any contribution to a matrix element of v (r)() has an

(3.70) can only hold if n (i)

int  3 in massless 3 theory and if

n (i)
int  2, but eq.
n (i)
int  4 in pure-glue qcd.
suppose that n (i)
int = 2.

in this case, eq. (3.70) implies that f (i)
ci

is quadratic

in transverse momenta. due to approximate cluster decomposition, only interacting

particles transverse momenta can appear in f (i)

ci . so any contribution to f (i)

ci can

depend on the transverse momenta of two interacting particles. thus f (i)

ci can be

written as a sum of terms, where each term corresponds to a distinct pair of interacting

particles. the momentum dependence of each term in f (i)

ci is limited to dependence

on the momenta of the interacting particles and the total longitudinal momentum:

f (i)
ci ({pn},{an}) = xm
= xm

f (i,m)

ci

(km, k

m, p +,{an})

f (i,m)

ci

(km, p +,{an}),

(3.71)

where km and k

m are the momenta for the initial and nal particles in the mth

interacting pair, and where we have used the fact that for n (i)

int = 2, momentum

49

conservation implies that km = k

m. f (i,m)

ci must be quadratic in ~km or it must be

zero. the matrix elements of the imo are boost-invariant, as is the delta-function

product in eq. (3.68). this means that f (i)

ci must be boost-invariant, but it cannot

be if f (i,m)

ci

is quadratic in ~km; so f (i,m)

ci must be zero. thus the reduced interaction

does not contain any cuto-independent two-point interactions.

note that two-point interactions are self-energies, and they change the particle

dispersion relation. if they change the dispersion relation such that the coecients

of the free relation become modied by interactions, then this can be viewed as

renormalization of the eld operators, i.e. wave-function renormalization. this eect

is absent unless either f (i)

ci or f (i)

cd can be quadratic in transverse momenta for n (i)

int =

2. we have just shown that boost invariance prevents this for f (i)

ci , and according to

eq. (3.57), f (i)

cd cannot be quadratic in transverse momenta for n (i)

int = 2; so there is

no wave-function renormalization at any order in g in our approach.

at this point the analyses of the cuto-independent parts of the reduced inter-

actions in the two theories diverge. we rst consider massless 3 theory and then

pure-glue qcd.

according to eq. (3.70), in massless 3 theory, the only other possible contri-

bution to v (r)
ci

is from transverse-momentum-independent three-point interactions.

according to the discussion in subsection 3.3.4, v (r)() cannot have a three-point

interaction unless r is odd. this means that if r is odd, then v (r)

ci can contain only

three-point interactions that are independent of all transverse momenta, and if r is

even, then v (r)

ci = 0.

50

since v (r)

ci = 0 if r is even, for the remainder of this massless 3 discussion, we

assume that r is odd. then we need to consider only n (i)

int = 3. to calculate v (r)

ci , we

consider eq. (3.54) with r  r + 2:

cd ()|ii(i)  hf| v (r+2)

cd () |ii(i) =

hf| v (r+2)
"hf| v (r+2) |ii 

r+1

xs=2

br+2s,s hf| v (r+2s)()|ii#(i)

.

(3.72)

we expand eq. (3.72) in powers of transverse momenta and keep only the constant

term:

0 = "hf| v (r+2) |ii 

r+1

xs=2

br+2s,s hf| v (r+2s)()|ii#(i)
cd ()|ii(i) has no constant part when n (i)

~p 0
 term

,

(3.73)

int =

where we have used the fact that hf| v (r+2)
3 [see eq. (3.57)]. we move the rst term in the sum on the rhs to the lhs:

br,2 hf| v (r)

ci |ii(i) = "hf| v (r+2) |ii 

br+2s,s hf| v (r+2s)()|ii#

(i)

. (3.74)

~p 0
 term

r+1

xs=3

now we can sum over all values of i corresponding to three-point interactions. then

for any even r, v (r)

hf| v (r)

ci |ii =

ci = 0, and for any odd r  3,

xs=3

br+2s,s hf| v (r+2s)()|ii#3point

~p 0
 term

.

(3.75)

this equation tells us how to compute the cuto-independent part of the o(gr
duced interaction for odd r  3 in terms of the cuto-dependent part and lower-order
reduced interactions. to use the equation, the rhs has to be expanded in powers

) re-

of transverse momenta and only the constant (transverse-momentum-independent)

three-point interactions contribute. this is an integral equation15 because v (r)

ci ap-

pears on the rhs of the equation inside integrals in v (r+2). a cursory examination

15it is very dicult to prove that integral equations of this type have a unique solution; so we

simply assume it is true in this case.

51

of the denition of v (r+2) may lead one to believe that eq. (3.75) is useless because

it requires one to know v (r+1)(). however, since r is odd, v (r+1)() = v (r+1)

cd (),

and the dependence of v (r+2) on v (r+1)

cd () can be replaced with further dependence

on v (r)

ci and v (r)

cd() (and lower-order reduced interactions) using eq.

(3.66) with

r  r + 1.

to conclude our discussion of massless 3 theory, we would like to deduce a bit

more about the relationship of g to g . according to eq. (3.47) and the surrounding

discussion, this relationship is determined by the matrix element h23| v |1i, which
can be expanded in powers of g :

h23| v |1i =



xt=3

 h23| v (t) |1i .
gt

(3.76)

recall that v (t) is built from products of v (r)()s. this implies that v (t) can

change particle number by 1 only if t is odd, and thus eq. (3.76) implies that the

coupling runs at odd orders; i.e. cs is zero if s is even [see eq. (3.49)].

we now turn to the case of pure-glue qcd. in this theory, it is possible for there

to be both three-point and four-point interactions in v (r)

ci . according to eq. (3.70),

if n (i)

int = 3, then f (i)

ci has to be linear in transverse momenta, and if n (i)

int = 4, then

f (i)

ci has to be independent of all transverse momenta. according to assumptions that

we made in subsection 3.3.4, if r is odd then v (r)

ci has no n (i)

int = 4 part, and if r

is even then v (r)

ci has no n (i)

int = 3 part. this means that if r is odd, then v (r)

ci can

contain only three-point interactions that are linear in transverse momenta, and if r

is even, then v (r)

ci can contain only four-point interactions that are independent of all

transverse momenta.

to calculate v (r)

ci , we consider eq. (3.54) with r  r + 2:
hf| v (r+2)
cd () |ii(i) =

cd ()|ii(i)  hf| v (r+2)

br+2s,s hf| v (r+2s)()|ii#(i)

.

(3.77)

for the remainder of this discussion, we assume that r is odd. then we need to

consider only n (i)

int = 3 initially. we expand eq.

(3.77) in powers of transverse

momenta and keep only the linear term:

0 = "hf| v (r+2) |ii 

r+1

,

(3.78)

int = 3

where we have used the fact that hf| v (r+2)
[see eq. (3.57)]. we move the rst term in the sum on the rhs to the lhs:

br,2 hf| v (r)

r+1

xs=3

br+2s,s hf| v (r+2s)()|ii#

~p 1

. (3.79)

now we can sum over all values of i corresponding to three-point interactions:

1

ci |ii =

hf| v (r)

br,2 "hf| v (r+2) |ii 

br+2s,s hf| v (r+2s)()|ii#
to use this equation, we also need to use eq. (3.77) to solve for v (r+1)

xs=3

r+1

3point

~p 1
 term

.

(3.80)

ci

. since r is

odd, r + 1 is even. thus v (r+1)

ci

will contain only transverse-momentum-independent

four-point interactions. using steps analogous to those that led to eq. (3.80), we nd

that

hf| v (r+1)

|ii =

. (3.81)

to use these equations, the right-hand sides have to be expanded in powers of trans-

verse momenta. only three-point interactions that are linear in transverse momenta

contribute to v (r)

ci , and only four-point interactions that are independent of all trans-

verse momenta contribute to v (r+1)

ci

.

these equations are coupled integral equations because both v (r)

ci and v (r+1)

ci

ap-

pear on the rhs of eq. (3.80) inside integrals in v (r+2), and v (r+1)

ci

appears on the

53

rhs of eq. (3.81) inside integrals in v (r+3). it would seem that v (r+2)

ci

also appears

on the rhs of eq. (3.81) inside integrals in v (r+3), but v (r+2)

ci

cannot couple to v (1)

to produce a transverse-momentum-independent four-point contribution to v (r+3).

this is because the cuto function t (,)

2

vanishes when the intermediate state has

zero free mass and all the external transverse momenta are zero. this means that

since we specied v (1) and v (2)
ci

in subsection 3.3.4, we can use eqs.

(3.80) and

(3.81) to solve for v (3)

ci simultaneously,

ci and v (4)

ci simultaneously, and v (5)

ci and v (6)

and so on. note that before we can use these equations to solve for v (r)

ci and v (r+1)

ci

simultaneously, we must rst use eq. (3.66) both to compute v (r)

cd() in terms of

lower-order interactions and to express v (r+1)

cd () in terms of lower-order interactions

and v (r)().

to conclude our discussion of pure-glue qcd, we note that just as in the case of

massless 3 theory, v (t) can change particle number by 1 only if t is odd, and thus

the coupling runs at odd orders; i.e. cs is zero if s is even.

chapter 4

calculation and analysis of matrix

elements in massless 3 theory

in this chapter we demonstrate how to use the recursion relations for the imo by

calculating and analyzing some second- and third-order matrix elements of the imo

in massless 3 theory. we work in six dimensions explicitly.

we rst calculate some second-order matrix elements and show that they obey

the restriction of approximate transverse locality. we then show how our imo yields

cuto-independent perturbative scattering amplitudes, even though it explicitly de-

pends on the cuto. we proceed to calculate the emission matrix element of the imo

to third order (neglecting the cuto-independent part of the reduced interaction), in

terms of ve-dimensional integrals that we compute with monte carlo methods. in

the process of deriving this matrix element, we derive the cuto dependence of the

coupling and show how it relates to the standard result that one nds with dimen-

sional regularization.

4.1 second-order matrix elements

the matrix elements of the imo are dened in terms of the matrix elements of the

reduced interaction by eq. (3.2). to calculate matrix elements of the imo to second

55

order, we need to calculate the corresponding matrix elements of v (2)(), the second-

order reduced interaction. as mentioned in the previous chapter, for v (r)() to have

a cuto-independent part, r must be odd. according to eq. (3.66), this means that

v (2)() is given in terms of the second-order change to the reduced interaction by

hf| v (2)()|ii = hf| v (2) |ii  terms

,

(4.1)

where the second-order change to the reduced interaction is dened in terms of the

rst-order reduced interaction and the cuto function:

hf| v (2) |ii =

1

2 xk hf| v (1) |kihk| v (1) |ii t (,)

2

(f, k, i).

(4.2)

4.1.1 example: h2| m2()|1i

as a rst example, we compute the matrix element h2|m2()|1i to o(g2

). to

compute this matrix element, we use |ii = |1i and |fi = |2i. then the matrix
element of the second-order change to the reduced interaction is

h2| v (2) |1i =

1

2 xk h2| v (1) |ki hk| v (1) |1i t (,)

2

(f, k, i).

(4.3)

since v (1) changes particle number by 1, |ki has to be a two-particle state and eq.
(4.3) becomes

h2| v (2) |1i =

1

4 z d3d4 h2| v (1) |34ih34| v (1) |1i t (,)

h2| v (2) |1i diagrammatically in figure 4.1. using the expression for v (1) in eq.

the integral over p3 can be done with one of the delta functions. at this point it is

convenient to change variables from p+

4 and ~p4 to x and ~r:

p4 = (p+

4 , ~p4) = (xp+

1 , x~p1 + ~r),

(4.6)

where x is the fraction of the total longitudinal momentum that is carried by particle

4 and ~r is the transverse momentum of particle 4 in the center-of-mass frame. we

only display the longitudinal and transverse components of the momentum. (since

the states that we use are free states, and since the momentum of a free massless scalar

particle satises p2 = 0, the minus component of the momentum of i is constrained

to be given by p

i .) the momentum-conserving delta functions imply that

i = ~p 2

i/p+

p3 = (cid:16)[1  x]p+

1 , [1  x]~p1  ~r(cid:17) .

(4.7)

note that all longitudinal momenta are positive, although in this chapter we do not

display the step functions that enforce this. this implies, for example, that 0 < x < 1.

f = 0.

still has a free mass from the particles relative motion:

to apply eq. (4.1), we recall that we are to expand the rhs of eq. (4.12) in powers

of transverse momenta and keep only those terms that are proportional to powers

or inverse powers of . this yields the matrix element of the second-order reduced

interaction:

h2| v (2)()|1i = 1,2 2

1

15363r 

2

.

(4.13)

using the denition of the imo in terms of the reduced interaction, we nd that to

second order, the matrix element of the imo is given by

h2|m2()|1i = 1,2 2 g2



1

15363r 

2

.

(4.14)

this matrix element of the imo has been completely determined to second or-

der, in terms of the fundamental parameters of the theory, by the restrictions that

58

the imo has to produce cuto-independent physical quantities and has to respect

the unviolated physical principles of the theory. if we wanted to compute physical

quantities, this is one of the matrix elements of the imo that we might need. we

would have to choose  and determine g by tting data since the theory contains

one adjustable parameter. note that eq. (4.14) is consistent with all the restrictions

that we have placed on the imo.

4.1.2 example: h34|m2()|12i

next we calculate the matrix element h34| m2()|12i to o(g2

). we use

|ii = |12i and |fi = |34i. then the matrix element of the second-order change
to the reduced interaction is

h34| v (2) |12i =

1

2 xk h34| v (1) |kihk| v (1) |12i t (,)

2

(f, k, i).

(4.15)

since v (1) changes particle number by 1, |ki has to be either a one- or three-particle
state. when v (1) is substituted into the rhs of this equation and all the creation

and annihilation operators from the possible intermediate states and the interac-

tions are contracted, we see that h34| v (2) |12i has contributions from a num-
ber of dierent processes. we dene h34| v (2) |12is to be the contribution to
h34| v (2) |12i from the process shown in figure 4.2s, where s = a, b, c, . . . , i.
then

h34| v (2) |12i =

i

xs=ah34| v (2) |12is .

(4.16)

eq.

(4.1) suggests that we dene a contribution to the matrix element of the

second-order reduced interaction for each contribution to h34| v (2) |12i:

h34| v (2)()|12is = h34| v (2) |12is  terms ,

note that eqs.

(4.13) and (4.29) indicate that to o(g2

eect a spectator has on the self-energy is to produce an extra delta function. if our

cuto respected cluster decomposition, this would be all that could happen. however,

our cuto partially violates cluster decomposition. this means that in principle the

self-energy could depend on x, the fraction of the total longitudinal momentum that

is carried by particle 1. this requires a violation of cluster decomposition because

x = p+

1 /(p+

1 +p+

2 ), and p2 is the momentum of a spectator (see figure 4.2b). although

this manifestation of the violation of cluster decomposition is not seen at second order

in this theory, it is in pure-glue qcd [see eq. (5.74)].

the complete matrix element and transverse locality

using eqs. (3.2) and (3.31), we can write the full second-order matrix element of

xs=ah34| v (2)()|12is .

(4.35)

by inspection, it is clear that this result respects all the restrictions we have placed

on the imo, except perhaps the requirement that it can be represented as a power

series in transverse momenta with an innite radius of convergence. to see how to

check this, consider the rst term in the sum on the rhs:

e42

f i g2

the presence of the mass denominators might seem likely to cause a problem with the

can be expressed as a power series in transverse momenta if it can be expressed as a

power series in m 2

if we approximate the rhs of this equation by keeping only n terms, the dier-

ence between this nite sum and the rhs of eq.

(4.36) can be made arbitrarily

e42

f i g2

f and m 2

small, for any values of m 2

i , by making n large enough. this means that
 h34| v (2)()|12ia can indeed be represented as a power series in trans-
verse momenta with an innite radius of convergence. the other contributions to

h34|m2()|12i can be analyzed similarly, and the conclusion is the same for
each.

4.1.3 example: h234|m2()|1i

the nal second-order matrix element that we compute is h234|m2()|1i.
to compute this matrix element, we use |ii = |1i and |fi = |234i. the matrix
element of the second-order change to the reduced interaction is

h234| v (2) |1i =

1

2 xk h234| v (1) |ki hk| v (1) |1i t (,)

2

(f, k, i).

(4.38)

since v (1) changes particle number by 1, |ki has to be a two-particle state.

we dene h234| v (2) |1is to be the contribution to h234| v (2) |1i from

the process shown in figure 4.3s, where s = a, b, c. then

66

h234| v (2) |1i =

c

xs=ah234| v (2) |1is .

(4.39)

eq. (4.1) suggests that we dene a contribution to the matrix element of the second-

order reduced interaction for each contribution to h234| v (2) |1i:

h234| v (2)()|1is = h234| v (2) |1is  terms ,

(4.40)

and then

h234| v (2)()|1i =

c

xs=ah234| v (2)()|1is .

(4.41)

for each contribution to h234| v (2) |1i, we use |ki = |56i and the change

of variables

where

p2 = (xp+

1 , x~p1 + ~r),

p3 = (yp+

1 , y~p1 + ~q),

p4 = (zp+

(4.42)

x + y + z = 1,

as before, if we expand everything multiplying the delta function in powers of

transverse momenta, the lowest-order terms from the two exponentials cancel and

leave two types of terms: those that are proportional to inverse powers of  and

those that are proportional to inverse powers of . we can isolate the terms that

are proportional to inverse powers of  without altering the cancellation of the lowest

term by replacing the rst exponential with a 1:

h234| v (2)()|1ia = 325p+

using the denition of the imo in terms of the reduced interaction, we can write the

h234|m2()|1i = e4m 4

f g2



c

xs=ah234| v (2)()|1is .

(4.50)

this result is consistent with the restrictions that we have placed on the imo.

4.2 the removal of cuto dependence from physical quan-

tities

one of the restrictions on the imo is that it has to produce cuto-independent

physical quantities. to see how this requirement is fullled, consider as an example

the scattering cross section for 12  34. at second order, the t matrix has
contributions from the s, t, and u channels. the dierent channels are linearly inde-

pendent functions of the external momenta; so each contribution should individually

have all the properties required of the full t matrix. for simplicity, we limit ourselves

to consideration of the s (annihilation) channel.

in our approach, the scattering matrix s is dened by

hf| s |ii = hf|ii  2i(p 

f  p 

i ) hf| t (p 

i ) |ii ,

where the t matrix is dened by [27]

t (p) = hint() + hint()

1
p  p 
free + i

t (p),

and hint() is the interacting part of the hamiltonian cut o by :

hint() = m2

1

p
1 + p

2  p 

free + i

hint()|12i .

(4.54)

if we neglect all noncanonical operators, the rst term does not contribute and the

second term can be calculated by inserting a complete set of free states. this leads

to

(p 

f  p 

i ) h34| t (p 

i ) |12i =



g2

e24m 4

i 645(6)(p1 + p2  p3  p4), (4.55)

where |ii = |12i and |fi = |34i. the cross section is cuto-independent only if
the t matrix is cuto-independent. thus eq. (4.55) shows that the cuto appears

in physical quantities if noncanonical operators are neglected.

to test whether our procedure for computing m2() leads to cuto-independent
physical quantities, we now include noncanonical operators. this means that we have

to include the rst term in eq. (4.54):

h34| hint()|12i =

=

1

e42

f i g2

p+
1 + p+
2
g2

m 2



 h34| v (2)()|12ia
i(cid:17)645(5)(p1 + p2  p3  p4),(4.56)

where the result for the annihilation contribution to the second-order reduced inter-

action is used, and we use the fact that we only need the on-energy-shell part. this

contribution shifts the t matrix so that the total t matrix is

(p 

f  p 

i ) h34| t (p 

i ) |12i =



g2
m 2
i

645(6)(p1 + p2  p3  p4).

(4.57)

70

since g2

 is cuto-independent at second order [dg2

/d = o(g4

)], this is the correct

cuto-independent result to o(g2
).

our restrictions on the imo have led to its matrix elements being such that they

compensate for the presence of the cuto in physical quantities. no proof exists, but

we expect that our procedure leads to a renormalized imo that produces exactly

correct perturbative scattering amplitudes order-by-order. when this imo is used

nonperturbatively, however, there will be some cuto dependence in the resulting

physical quantities, as we have mentioned in previous chapters.

4.3 h23|m2()|1i to third order

we wish to calculate h23| m2()|1i to third order to demonstrate how a
higher-order calculation proceeds and to derive the cuto dependence of the cou-

pling in our approach.

in chapter 3 we postulated that matrix elements of even-

order reduced interactions cannot contain three-point interactions. this means that

h23|m2()|1i has only odd-order contributions. the rst-order contribution is
dened in terms of the rst-order reduced interaction, which we have dened in eq.

(3.37). the third-order contribution is dened in terms of the third-order reduced

interaction. in this section, we compute the third-order contribution, neglecting the

cuto-independent part of the third-order reduced interaction. eq. (3.75) shows that

a calculation of the cuto-independent part would be a fth-order calculation, which

we avoid at this time.

according to eq.

(3.66), the cuto-dependent part of the third-order reduced

interaction is given by

h23| v (3)

cd()|1i = hh23| v (3) |1i  b1,2 h23| v (1) |1ii terms

.

(4.58)

71

h23| v (3) |1i is dened by

where we are suppressing the dependence of the cuto functions on the states. note

that b1,2 = c3 and is given by

b1,2 = h645p+

1 (5)(p1  p2  p3)i1

h23| v (3) |1i ~p2=~p3; p+

2 =p+

3

= hh23| v (1) |1ii1

h23| v (3) |1i ~p2=~p3; p+

2 =p+

3

.

(4.60)

eq. (4.58) then becomes

h23| v (3)

cd()|1i = (cid:20)h23| v (3) |1i  h23| v (3) |1i ~p2=~p3; p+

2 =p+

3(cid:21) terms

.(4.61)

this equation indicates that h23| v (3)
h23| v (3) |1i, which we now calculate.

cd()|1i can be computed solely in terms of

all the matrix elements of the second-order reduced interaction that can appear

on the rhs of eq.

(4.59) were calculated in section 4.1. when h23| v (3) |1i
is expanded in terms of the possible intermediate states and possible contributions

to matrix elements of v (1) and v (2)(), we see that it has contributions from a

number of dierent processes. we dene h23| v (3) |1is to be the contribution to
h23| v (3) |1i from the process shown in figure 4.4s, where s = a, b, c, . . . , o. in
figure 4.4, the plain vertices represent matrix elements of v (1) and the boxes represent

contributions to matrix elements of v (2)() corresponding to the processes depicted

in the boxes. for example, the box in figure 4.4l represents h23| v (2)() |45if

4.3.4 the cuto dependence of the coupling

we now have the complete matrix element of the third-order change to the re-

duced interaction in terms of numerical functions of ~q, the transverse momentum of

particle 2 in the center-of-mass frame, and y, the fraction of the total longitudinal

momentum that is carried by particle 2. we rst use the matrix element to compute

the cuto dependence of g. according eq. (4.60), we need h23| v (3) |1i in the
limit p+
f = 0, and all the integrals in

3 and ~p2 = ~p3. in this limit, ~q = m 2

2 = p+

h23| v (3) |1i can be done analytically. however, care must be used when taking
this limit because there are delicate cancellations of divergences among the dierent

parts of each integrand. the result of applying eq. (4.60) is

b1,2 = c3 =

3

5123 log

 2
2 ,

which from eq. (3.49) implies that

g = g +

3

5123 g3

 log

 2
2 + o(g5
 ).

79

(4.87)

(4.88)

this equation tells us how the couplings at two dierent cutos are related. since

 > , eq.

(4.88) shows that g > g . this means the coupling grows as we

reduce the amount by which free masses can change. this shows that the theory is

asymptotically free, as expected.

in conventional covariant perturbation theory with the minimal subtraction (ms)

renormalization scheme, one obtains, for the scale dependence of the coupling [28],

g = g +

3

5123 g3

 log

 2
2 + o(g5

),

(4.89)

where  and  are two dierent renormalization points. we see that our coupling

changes with our cuto in the same manner that the ms coupling changes with the

renormalization point. this is what one expects due to the scheme independence of

the one-loop beta function. however, since there is no simple connection between our

scheme and the ms scheme, we expect there to be no simple relation between the

respective couplings at higher orders (although we could derive the relationship by

equating physical quantities calculated in the two schemes).

4.3.5 numerical results for the three-point matrix element

we now proceed to calculate the matrix element of the cuto-dependent part of

the third-order reduced interaction. from eq. (4.61),

h23| v (3)

cd()|1i = hh23| v (3) |1i  h23| v (3) |1i ~q=0i terms

,

(4.90)

where we use the fact that the ~q = 0 limit of h23| v (3) |1i is independent of p+
p+
3 . the imo is invariant under rotations about the 3-axis and ~q is the only trans-

2 and

verse vector on which h23| v (3) |1i depends. this means that h23| v (3) |1i is
. by inspection, we can see that h23| v (3) |1i is the product of n
a function of ~q 2

80

and some dimensionless quantity, and is the dierence of a function of  and the same

function with   . also, by our assumption of approximate transverse locality,
the rhs of eq. (4.90) can be expanded in powers of ~q. thus

h23| v (3) |1i  h23| v (3) |1i ~q=0 = n



xi=1

fi(y)~q 2i

 (cid:16)2i  2i(cid:17) ,

(4.91)

where the fis are unknown dimensionless functions of y. this implies that

h23| v (3)

cd()|1i = hh23| v (3) |1i  h23| v (3) |1i ~q=0i terms



= n

fi(y)~q 2i

 2i

xi=1

= (cid:16)h23| v (3) |1i  h23| v (3) |1i ~q=0(cid:17) 

. (4.92)

using this equation and our result for h23| v (3) |1i, it is straightforward to write
h23| v (3)

cd()|1i as a numerical function of ~q, y, and .

it is clear by inspection that h23| v (3) |1i is symmetric under y  1  y and
f , the free mass of the nal

each h23| v (3) |1is for s  i is a function only of m 2
state. it is not clear from inspection if the rest of h23| v (3) |1i is a function only
of m 2
f and there is no reason that it should be. this means that the matrix element

of the imo is not necessarily a function only of m 2
f .

our result for the three-point matrix element of the imo through third order,

neglecting any cuto-independent contribution to the third-order reduced interaction,

is

h23|m2()|1i = e4m 4

f h645p+

1 (5)(p1  p2  p3)g

to get an idea of the size of the noncanonical contribution to the matrix element,

we can compare it to the canonical contribution. to do this, we need to choose a

81

value for the coupling. we would like to choose a large coupling so that we can get

a pessimistic estimate of whether or not the expansion for the imo is converging.

when the coupling is large, the second term in eq. (4.88) is nearly as large as the

rst. the value of log( 2/2) is our choice, but the natural value is 1, because then

the range of scales over which o-diagonal matrix elements of the imo are being

removed is comparable to the range of scales that remain. thus we estimate that a

large coupling is g2

 = 5123/3.

using this coupling, figure 4.5 compares the regulated canonical and noncanonical

contributions to the matrix element as functions of the free mass of the nal state. the

plot is the result of a numerical computation using the vegas monte carlo algorithm

for multidimensional integration [29]. the contributions to the matrix element are

plotted in units of the matrix element of the unregulated canonical interaction, and

we consider only the situation in which the two nal-state particles share the total

longitudinal momentum equally. the solid curve represents the canonical contribution

and the diamonds represent the noncanonical contribution. the statistical error bars

from the monte carlo integration are too small to be visible.

figure 4.5 shows that for the case we consider, the noncanonical corrections to

the matrix element of the imo are small compared to the canonical part, even when

the perturbative expansion of the coupling is breaking down. however, this does

not necessarily imply that corrections to physical quantities from the noncanonical

part of this matrix element would be small. an investigation of this would require a

fth-order calculation in this theory; so we do not pursue it.

for the same coupling, figure 4.6 shows the noncanonical part of the matrix

element as a function of the fraction of the total longitudinal momentum that is

82

carried by particle 2 for xed free mass of the nal state. it is plotted in units of the

matrix element of the unregulated canonical interaction for three dierent values of

the free mass of the nal state. this plot shows that the noncanonical part of the

matrix element is a function of y for xed m 2

f , and thus is not a function only of m 2
f .

chapter 5

calculation of glueball states and masses

in pure-glue qcd

in this chapter we calculate part of the pure-glue qcd imo and diagonalize it,

obtaining glueball states and masses. we work in four dimensions explicitly and begin

by dening a basis in terms of which we expand all physical states. we construct

the physical states to be simultaneous eigenstates of the imo, the three-momentum

operator, and the part of the generator of rotations about the 3-axis that generates

rotations of the internal degrees of freedom of states (as opposed to their centers of

mass). we approximate all physical states as two-gluon states, which means that

they are relatively simple single-glueball states. we analytically calculate the color

parts of the states by requiring the states to be color singlets, and then we expand

the states spin and momentum degrees of freedom in a complete set of orthonormal

basis functions. after deriving the eigenvalue equation for the imo in this basis, we

use the recursion relations for the imo to compute its two-gluon to two-gluon matrix

element to second order in the running coupling. this is the only free-state matrix

element that we need to solve the eigenvalue equation.

we compute the matrix elements of the imo in our basis, in terms of integrals

that must be evaluated numerically. to avoid roundo error, we evaluate the integrals

86

for the kinetic energy and the two-point interaction (the self-energy) by writing them

as sums of gamma functions. the remaining integrals are ve-dimensional, and we

compute them with monte carlo methods. however, before we can do this, it is

necessary for us to make manifest the cancellation of the infrared divergences from

exchanged gluons with innitesimal longitudinal momentum. this is nontrivial, and

even after the divergences are gone, we must manipulate the integrals quite a bit to

get them into a form that is amenable to monte carlo integration. we present some

of these details and other technical issues in appendix c.

we proceed by discussing how we assign quantum numbers to our numerical results

for glueball states and the procedure that we use to compute these results. we

derive the nonperturbative cuto dependence of the coupling and discuss the cuto

dependence of our glueball masses. we use this analysis to choose the value of the

cuto that minimizes our errors. we then present the spectrum that we nd with

this optimal cuto and compare it to recent lattice results. the last results that we

present are the probability densities for our glueballs. we conclude this chapter by

discussing the sources of error in the calculation and estimating the uncertainty in

our spectrum from these errors.

5.1 the basis for the expansion of physical states

5.1.1 preliminaries

the physical states of pure-glue qcd are eigenstates of m2(). since our cuto
preserves translational covariance and covariance under rotations about the 3-axis,

we would like the states to also be simultaneous eigenstates of the generators of

these symmetries, but this is impossible because translations do not commute with

87

rotations. however, a rotation about the 3-axis separates into a part that rotates the

centers of mass of states and a part that rotates states internal degrees of freedom,

and translations do commute with these internal rotations.

to be precise, we recall from chapter 2 that j3 is the generator of rotations about
the 3-axis, and we dene j r
3 to be the part of j3 governing gluons momenta in the
center-of-mass frame and spin polarizations. m2(), p +, ~p, and j r
3 are a set of
commuting observables; so an eigenstate of m2() can be labeled by their eigenvalues.
we choose to write a physical state as |jn(p )i, where p is the three-momentum of
the state, j is the eigenvalue of j r
for the state, and n labels the mass eigenvalue
of the state (n = 1 has the smallest mass, n = 2 has the second-smallest mass, etc.).

3

note that because |jn(p )i will be determined by m2(), it will implicitly depend
on  and g.

an examination of the matrix elements of m2() leads us to believe that the
light-front infrared divergences (see the discussion below) will not cancel unless the

physical states are color singlets, although we do not have a rigorous proof of this.

therefore, we assume that the physical states are color singlets. using the fock-space

expansion for the identity operator, we can expand a physical state in terms of the

number of gluons:

(5.1)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

jn(p )e = 1(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

jn(p )e 

1

2! z d1d2dg1g2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

jn(p )e|g1g2i ,

where there is no one-gluon component because there is no color-singlet gluon. we

neglect contributions to the states with more than two gluons, which is a severe

approximation. this means that we are approximating all physical states as relatively

simple single-glueball states, and j is then the projection of the glueballs spin onto the

88

3-axis. from now on, we refer to the approximate physical states simply as glueball

states.

any eigenstate of m2() can be written as a superposition of cross-product states:

jn(p )e = xi

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

|n,ii (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

jn

i (p )e ,

(5.2)

where |n,ii is the color part of the ith contribution to the state and (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

momentum/spin part.

jn

i (p )e is the

the free state |g1g2i is dened as a two-gluon state in which one particle has
quantum numbers p1, s1, and c1, and the other has quantum numbers p2, s2, and c2.

|g1g2i is symmetrized with respect to particle labels. thus we can write

|g1g2i =

1

2h|g1; g2i + |g2; g1ii,

(5.3)

where the semi-colon in |g1; g2i indicates that particle #1 has quantum numbers p1,
s1, and c1, and particle #2 has quantum numbers p2, s2, and c2. then we can write

the wave function as the sum of two permutations:

jn(p )e =

dg1g2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

1

2hhg1; g2| + hg2; g1|i(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

jn(p )e .

(5.4)

this implies that the wave function hg1g2 |jn(p )i is symmetric under exchange of
particles 1 and 2. using eq. (5.2), we can write the rst permutation as

dg1; g2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

jn(p )e = xi hc1; c2 |n,ii dp1, s1; p2, s2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

jn

i (p )e .

(5.5)

jn

i (p )e are the color and momentum/spin wave func-

hc1; c2 |n,ii and dp1, s1; p2, s2(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

tions for the rst permutation of the ith contribution to the total wave function.

89

5.1.2 calculation of the color wave function

in our two-gluon approximation, the fact that the glueball states are color singlets

uniquely determines their color wave functions. using the completeness relation for

color states, the color part of the ith contribution to the glueball state can be written

|n,ii = xc1c2 |c1; c2i hc1; c2 |n,ii .

(5.6)

let y be the unitary operator that rotates two-gluon states in color space. then

under a color rotation, we have

|n,ii  (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)



n,ie = xc1c2
y |c1; c2i hc1; c2 |n,ii
1; c
= xc1c2 |c
2i hc1; c2 |n,ii ,

(5.7)

where the primes on the basis vectors denote rotated basis states. since |n,ii is a
color singlet, it does not change under a color rotation:



n,ie = xc1c2 |c
1; c

a gluon color-rotated state is given by [30]

|n,ii = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

2ihc1; c2 |n,ii .

|c
1i = u |c1i = xc2 |c2ihc2| u |c1i = xc2

uc2c1 |c2i ,

where

and

u = eic1

f c1

f c1
c2c3 = if c1c2c3.

(5.8)

(5.9)

(5.10)

(5.11)

here c is a vector of n 2

c  1 real numbers that parameterize the color rotation. since

90

1; c
|c

2i = |c

1i  |c

2i ,

eqs. (5.8) and (5.9) imply that

|n,ii = xc1c2c3c4 hc1; c2 |n,ii uc3c1uc4c2 |c3; c4i .

as a guess, let us try

hc1; c2 |n,ii =

1
n

c1,c2,

where n is some constant. then eq. (5.13) becomes

|n,ii =

1

n xc1c3c4

uc3c1uc4c1 |c3; c4i .

(u 1)cc = (u )cc = u 

cc = ucc.

note that

then

|n,ii =

c3,c4 |c3; c4i

1

n xc3c4

= xc1c2 hc1; c2 |n,ii |c1; c2i
= |n,ii .

(5.12)

(5.13)

(5.14)

(5.15)

(5.16)

(5.17)

since this is true, our guess for a color-singlet wave function was correct. this solution

is unique [31]; so we can drop the subscript i in eq.

(5.5). n is determined by

normalization to be qn 2

c  1.

now eq. (5.4) becomes

(5.18)

since the imo conserves momentum, the factor in brackets must be proportional to

a momentum-conserving delta function. thus we can write

where jn

s1s2(p1, p2) is the momentum/spin wave function with the momentum-conser-

ving delta function removed, and all the extra factors in this equation are present to

simplify the normalization of jn

s1s2(p1, p2). we must solve for jn

s1s2(p1, p2), and this

equation indicates that it is symmetric under exchange of particles 1 and 2.

5.1.3 jacobi variables

using eq.

(5.19), the fock-state expansion for a glueball state in eq.

(5.1)

becomes

1

(5.20)

where momentum conservation implies that p2 = p  p1. it is useful to separate the
motion of the center of mass of the state from the internal motions of the gluons. to

do this, we change variables from p1 to the jacobi variables x and ~k:

p1 = (xp +, x ~p + ~k),

p2 = ([1  x]p +, [1  x] ~p  ~k).

(5.21)

92

here x is the fraction of the total longitudinal momentum that is carried by particle

1, and ~k is the transverse momentum of particle 1 in the center-of-mass frame. we

only display the longitudinal and transverse components of the momenta. (since the

glueball state is a superposition of free-particle states, and since the momentum of a

free gluon satises p2 = 0, the minus components of the momenta of g1 and g2 are

constrained to be given by p

i = ~p 2

i/p+

in terms of the jacobi variables, the glueball state is

(5.22)

where we explicitly show the dependence of the rhs ket on the jacobi variables

and the total momentum. recall from chapter 2 that each particles momentum

transforms the same way under a boost, regardless of whether the particle is point-

like or composite. we can use this to show that jn

s1s2(x, ~k, p ) is independent of p .

to do this, we apply a boost operator to both sides of eq. (5.22):

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
jn(p )e =

(x  )(1  x  )

(5.23)

where the boost takes the glueballs momentum from p to p . note that the boost

does not aect the wave function, only the kets. since eq. (5.22) holds for all p , it

holds in particular for p :

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
jn(p )e =

93

eqs. (5.23) and (5.24) contradict each other unless the wave function jn

is independent of p :

s1s2(x, ~k, p ) = jn
jn

s1s2(x, ~k).

(5.25)

thus we can write |jn(p )i as

since the glueball state is symmetric under exchange of the two gluons, the behaviors

of the spin and momentum wave functions under exchange of the two gluons imply

that if q = 4, then l + a must be odd, and if q 6= 4, then l + a must be even (so that
the spin and momentum wave functions have the same symmetry under exchange).

(5.51)

due to the symmetry of the glueball state under the exchange of particles 1 and

2, the basis state |q, l, t, ji is zero if l + j is odd and q 6= 4, or if l + j is even and
q = 4. to take advantage of this, we consider only the subspace in which l + j is even

5.2 calculation of the free-state matrix element of the in-

variant-mass operator

5.2.1 preliminaries

before we can solve the eigenvalue equation, we must calculate the matrix elements

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji. these can be written in terms of the free-state matrix
2|m2()|g1g2i, which is specied by our renormalization procedure. we
1g
element hg
are going to calculate this matrix element to second order in perturbation theory.

before continuing, we would like to point out three simplications that we repeat-

edly use in this section. to make these simplications clear, we note that the matrix

elements hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji can be written as integrals of wave functions
1g
times the free-state matrix element hg
2|m2()|g1g2i. to make the rst simplica-
1g
tion, we observe that hg
2|m2()|g1g2i has step functions on the particles longitu-
dinal momenta, and these step functions are redundant because they also appear in

the integrals that dene hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji. we drop these step functions in

100

the formulas that we present for hg
2|m2()|g1g2i. to make the second simplica-
1g
tion, we point out that the matrix elements hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji are symmetric
under exchange of the two initial-state gluons and also under exchange of the two

1g
nal-state gluons. because of this, when we are computing hg
2|m2()|g1g2i, we
combine terms that are related by exchange of the two initial-state or two nal-state

gluons. finally, due to the color-singlet nature of the glueball states, certain parts

1g
of hg
2| m2()|g1g2i do not contribute to hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji, and we drop
these terms.

we begin by dening jacobi variables for the nal state of the free matrix element:

1 = (xp +, x ~p + ~k 
p
2 = ([1  x]p +, [1  x] ~p  ~k 
p
).

perry showed that with a suitable denition of long-range interactions, a renormal-

ization method that is similar to ours yields a logarithmically conning potential for

quark-antiquark bound states at o(g2
cutos and is based on an analysis of the part of the two-body interaction that is

) [9]. his calculation uses sharp step-function

most singular in the limit in which the exchanged gluon has innitesimal longitu-

dinal momentum. the corresponding part of our interaction, which is contained in

2| m2()|g1g2ib

hg
2|m2()|g1g2iin+ex and hg
in the quark-antiquark case. however, to determine whether or not our interaction

in, is similar to what perry found

is truly conning, we would have to do a careful analysis of the complete two-body

109

potential, not just the most singular part. this analysis would be complicated by the

smooth cuto that we employ, and we leave it for future consideration.

5.3 calculation of the matrix elements of the invariant-

mass operator in the basis for physical states

the matrix elements hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji, which appear in the eigenvalue
equation, can be divided into contributions corresponding to the dierent terms in

eq. (5.87):

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji = hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jike

+ hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jif
+ hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jif
+ hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jib

se + hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jicon
ex + hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jiin+ex
in + hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jid
se .

(5.88)

in this section we express these dierent contributions in terms of integrals that can

be computed numerically. these integrals fall into two classes: two-dimensional and

ve-dimensional. we treat each class of integral separately.

each of the terms in eq. (5.88) is proportional to the plane-wave normalization

factor 163p +(3)(p  p ). to make the remaining equations that we present sim-
pler, we suppress this factor. we also take the limit   0 in any contribution to
hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji that is nite in this limit.

5.3.1 the two-dimensional integrals

the kinetic energy

using the denition of our basis in eq. (5.49) and the expression for the free-state

matrix element of the kinetic energy in eq. (5.82), we nd that

(5.89)

note that the kinetic energy is innite unless e > 0, whereas normalizability requires

only e > 1/2.

these integrals can be computed with standard numerical integration routines,

but the results can have large errors for large values of the function indices l, l, t,

and t, due to the oscillating nature of the basis functions. it is better to rewrite the

integrals as sums that can be computed numerically with mathematica [32] to any

desired precision. using the denitions of the basis functions,

method for evaluating integrals that we use for the kinetic energy. this yields

5.3.2 the five-dimensional integrals

the contact interaction

using the denition of our basis in eq. (5.49) and the expression for the free-state

matrix element of the contact interaction in eqs. (5.61) and (5.82), we nd that

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jicon =

the reader may have noticed that this integral is not ve-dimensional as we have

implied, but rather four-dimensional. however, when we numerically compute the

integrals that have more than two dimensions, it is most ecient if we combine them

into one integral; so we want their integration variables and their ranges of integration

to be identical. thus we increase the number of dimensions of this integral by one by

introducing an extra integral over  =    using the identity

1 =

1

2 z d () (2  ).

(5.95)

this will help us to combine this integral with others that contain integrals over 

that cannot be done analytically.

since the integration domain of the exchange interaction is restricted so that

x > x when   0 [note the step function in eq. (5.80)], we would like to enforce
this restriction in the other contributions. using the identity

112

1 = (x  x) + (x  x),

we break the longitudinal integral in eq. (5.94) into two parts:

z dx dx (x)(1  x)(x)(1  x) l(e)

l (x) l(e)

l (x)e42

f i

 [(x  x) + (x  x)].

(5.96)

(5.97)

in the second term, we let x  1  x and x  1  x, and then the longitudinal
integral becomes

z dx dx (x)(1  x)(x)(x  x) l(e)

l (x) l(e)

l (x)e42

f i h1 + (1)l+li .

(5.98)

recall that we are restricting ourselves to the subspace of the states |q, l, t, ji in which
l + j is even if q 6= 4, and l + j is odd if q = 4. then since q = q for the contact
interaction, l and l must both be even or both be odd for this interaction. this

means that the two terms in eq. (5.98) are equal. thus we can write the contact

interaction contribution as follows:

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jicon = 

ncg2



83 "j,2q,2q,2 + j,2q,1q,1  j,0q,3q,3#

 z d  e42

f i ,

(5.99)

where

d = dx dx dk dk d k k (x) (1  x) (x) (x  x) (k) (k) () (2  ), (5.100)

and

 = l(e)

l (x) l(e)

l (x)t (d)

t (k)t (d)

t

(k).

(5.101)

113

the finite part of the exchange interaction

in order to simplify the contribution to hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji from the nite
part of the exchange interaction, we wish to change variables from  to  =   :

d2kd2k

 = dk dk d d k k (k) (k) () (2  ) () (2  )

= dk dk d d k k (k) (k) ( + ) (2    ) () (2  ). (5.102)

all the contributions to hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji depend on  only through depen-
dence on cos  and sin . this means that we can use the identity

z 2



df (cos , sin ) = z 2

0

df (cos , sin )

(5.103)

to write

d2kd2k

 = dk dk d d k k (k) (k) () (2  ) () (2  ).

(5.104)

inspection of eq. (5.78) implies that the integrals in hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jif

ex

depend on complex exponentials of  and . however, using the identity

z 2

0

df (cos ) sin a = 0,

(5.105)

where a is an integer, we can do the  integral in hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jif
write the remainder as a real quantity with integrals that depend on  only through

ex and

cos  and sin . the result is

each of these terms is nite and we have taken   0 everywhere. we have written
the rst two terms as sums that can be computed numerically, and the four remaining

terms as ve-dimensional integrals that can be grouped into one integral suitable for

numerical calculation.

(see appendix c for a discussion of some of the technical

issues involved in the numerical calculation of these matrix elements.) once we have

computed these matrix elements, we can diagonalize the matrix to obtain glueball

states and masses.

5.4 results and error analysis

in this section we diagonalize the imo matrix, obtaining glueball states and

masses. we then discuss the sources of error in the calculation. we begin by dis-

cussing the procedure that we use to calculate the results.

5.4.1 the procedure for calculating results

we represent a state using the notation j p c

j

, where j is our best guess for the

spin of the state, p is our best guess for the parity of the state, c represents the

charge-conjugation eigenvalue of the state (it is always + because we have an even

number of gluons), and j is the projection of the states spin onto the 3-axis. we

need to distinguish states with identical js and p s and dierent js because we do

121

not have manifest rotational symmetry.

if j = 0, we omit the subscript j in the

state notation. we use an asterisk in the state notation next to the value of c to

denote an excited state with the given quantum numbers. we will base our guesses

for j and p on the numerical degeneracies of the states that have identical js and

p s and dierent js, and on the ordering of the states according to lattice data (see

the discussion below). we consider only the ve lightest glueballs (not counting as

distinct those states that dier only in their value of j). the ve lightest glueballs

have spins j  2. this means that we need to consider only |j|  2. for a given |j|,
the states with j = |j| and j = |j| are degenerate and simply related (see appendix
c); so we explicitly consider only j = 0, 1, 2. we consider nine values of the coupling:

 = g2

/(4) = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, . . . , 0.9. to calculate our results, we implement the

following four-step procedure.

we execute the rst step for all pairs (j, ). in this step, we dene  = 1 and

diagonalize hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji with all 4 spin basis functions (q = 1, 2, 3, 4),
but with only the lowest transverse-magnitude basis function (t = 0) and the two

lowest longitudinal basis functions (l = 0, 1). (it is necessary to use an even number of

longitudinal basis functions so that symmetry and antisymmetry of the wave function

under x  1  x are equally represented.) we perform this diagonalization as a
function of the basis-function parameters d and e that determine the widths of the

transverse-magnitude and longitudinal wave functions, respectively, and we nd the

values of d and e that minimize the ground-state mass. this yields what we consider

to be the optimal wave-function widths for each pair (j, ).

we also execute the second step of the procedure for all pairs (j, ).

in this

step, we x d and e to be their computed optimal values and again dene  = 1.

122

we diagonalize the matrix with all 4 spin basis functions, nt transverse-magnitude

basis functions, and nl = 2nt longitudinal basis functions, for a total of 8n 2

t basis

functions, with nt = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 10. we use twice as many longitudinal functions as

transverse-magnitude functions because |q, l, t, ji is zero if l + j is even and q = 4, or
if l + j is odd and q 6= 4. we want to use as many basis functions as possible, but we
nd for all pairs (j, ) that when nt > 7, the statistical errors from the monte carlo

integrations of the matrix elements become overwhelming and the spectrum and wave

functions become unreliable. the evidence of the breakdown is sudden contamination

of the low-lying wave functions with high-order components. (see appendix c for a

more complete discussion of this topic.) thus in the remainder of our procedure, we

analyze the results that we nd in this step when nt = 7, which corresponds to 392

basis functions.

in the third step of the procedure, we use the mass of the 0+ state (our most

numerically reliable state) to determine the value of  for each . to do this, we

note that  is the only mass scale in the problem. this means that the mass of the

0+ state, m0+, can be written

m0+ = b(),

(5.132)

where b is a dimensionless function of . since we dened  = 1 in the second step

of our procedure, the diagonalization of the imo as a function of  yielded b().

in this third step, we consider  to be a parameter and dene m0+ to be a constant.

then for a given coupling, we can use the results of the second step of our procedure

to write the cuto in units of m0+:

/m0+ =

1

b()

.

123

(5.133)

figure 5.5 shows the result for the third step of our procedure: a plot of the

coupling as a function of the cuto. when  > 0.7 it is not a single-valued function

of the cuto. this is an indication that the coupling is too large. for this reason,

we consider only   0.7 in the remainder of our procedure. when   0.7,
the coupling decreases as the cuto increases, as expected. however,  depends

on  more strongly than one may expect. we expect that perturbative pure-glue

qcd would indicate that   1/ ln , but the result that we get is much closer to
  exp(a), where a is a constant. the reason for this is that the truncation of
the perturbative series for m2() and the truncation of the free-sector expansion of
the states introduce spurious cuto dependence in our results for physical quantities.

m0+ is one such physical quantity. the spurious cuto dependence of m0+ is

manifested through incorrect dependence of b() on . this means that  has to

compensate by depending on  incorrectly in order to keep m0+ a constant function

of . this results in the strong dependence of  on  that is shown in figure 5.5.

using the recent anisotropic euclidean lattice results of morningstar and peardon

[33], we can make a rough estimate of the range over which our cuto is varying in

figure 5.5. they found that the mass of the 0+ state is m0+ = 2.5900.0400.130
gev. this means that our cuto is varying from about 3.1  6.0 gev in figure 5.5.

the fourth step of our procedure is to determine the optimal value of the cuto,

or equivalently, the optimal value of the coupling. we use two criteria to determine

this. first we determine the value of the cuto for which the computed masses are

most independent of the cuto. figures 5.6, 5.7, and 5.8 show the masses of our states

with j = 0, 1, 2, respectively, as functions of the cuto. the masses and the cuto

are displayed in units of m0+. (recall that m0+ was dened to be independent of

124

the cuto in the process of dening the cuto as a function of the coupling.) the

seven values of the cuto at the points that we display correspond, from right to left,

to  = 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, . . . , 0.7. it is dicult to tell from these plots where the cuto

dependence is weakest (more points are needed), but we see that the dependence is

relatively weak from  = 0.5 to  = 0.7, which corresponds to /m0+ = 1.33 to

/m0+ = 1.20.

the second criterion that we use to determine the optimal cuto is the degree

to which the states with a given j and p and dierent js are degenerate. this

determines the cuto that minimizes the violation of rotational symmetry. we nd

that these degeneracies are best when  = 0.5. given this and the fact that figures

5.6  5.8 indicate that the cuto dependence of the masses is weak when  = 0.5 to

 = 0.7, we determine that  = 0.5 is the optimal coupling, and thus the optimal

cuto is /m0+ = 1.33. using the result of morningstar and peardon for the mass

of the 0+ state, we estimate that this cuto is about 3.4 gev.

5.4.2 results

now we present our main results. our glueball masses for  = 0.5 are summa-

rized in table 5.1, in units of the mass of the ground state (the 0++ state). table

5.1 also shows an average of lattice results from a number of dierent calculations for

the sake of comparison [34]. the uncertainties in our results that we report in table

5.1 are only the statistical uncertainties associated with the monte carlo evaluation

of the matrix elements of m2(). the full uncertainties are much larger (see the
discussion of sources of error below). we list three values of the masses for the 2++

and 2++ states for our calculation, corresponding to j = 0, 1, 2. in each case the

125

three masses would be degenerate if our calculation were exact. our results agree

with the lattice results quite well, perhaps better than we should have expected.

we display our spectrum graphically in figure 5.9. the masses are plotted in

units of the mass of the 0++ state and the vertical widths of the levels represent the

statistical uncertainties in the masses. the black lines connect the states that we

believe should be degenerate. we see that the 2++

0

and 2++

0

glueballs are relatively

degenerate with their 2++

1

and 2++

1

counterparts, and the 2++

2

is not too bad, but the

2++
2

glueball is much too light. our labeling of the states and subsequent assignment

of the expected degeneracies are based on the ordering of the lattice states and the

apparent degeneracies of the 2++

0

and 2++

0

states with the 2++

1

and 2++

1

states,

respectively.

we want to show some of the features of the glueball wave functions. rather

than presenting the spin-dependent wave functions themselves, we present more illu-

minating spin-independent probability densities. a glueball state has the plane-wave

normalization shown in eq. (5.51) as long as the wave function jn

s1s2(x, ~k) satises

z d2kdx(x)(1  x)xs1s2 |jn

s1s2(x, ~k)|2 = 1.

(5.134)

this implies that

z 

0

d  k

!z 1

0

dx (x, k/) = 1,

(5.135)

where we dene the dimensionless probability density (x, k/) by

(x, k/) = 2k xs1s2 |jn

s1s2(x, ~k)|2.

(5.136)

we show the probability densities for our glueballs in figures 5.10  5.18. the

masses of the states tend to increase as the probability densities move away from the

126

region x  1/2 and more towards the edges. this is what we expect based on the
form of the kinetic energy of a free state. notice that the probability density for the

2++
2

glueball is peaked around the region x  1/2 and looks similar to the probability
density for the 0++ glueball. this is consistent with its small mass. on the other

hand, the probability density for the 2++

glueball is away from the region x  1/2,
like the probability densities for its j = 0 and j = 1 counterparts, and its mass is

2

close to theirs.

5.4.3 error analysis

we now turn to a discussion of the sources of error in our calculation. the sources

of error are:

 truncation of the renormalized imo at o(g2
);
 truncation of the free-sector expansion of physical states at two gluons;
 truncation of the basis-function expansion of wave functions;
 numerical approximation of the matrix elements of m2().

we do not know how to estimate the size of any physical eects that require

nonperturbative renormalization. however, we can naively estimate the size of the

eects of higher-order perturbative renormalization. we have calculated the matrix

elements of m2() through o(); so the corrections to these matrix elements should
be o(2
/2). since we
have used  = 0.5, we estimate that the uncertainty in the mass spectrum from the

). this translates to corrections to the mass spectrum of o(2

eects of higher-order perturbative renormalization is about 13%.

we do not know how to estimate the size of any physical eects that require an

innite number of particles. in fact, until we include at least two free sectors, it is

127

impossible to directly estimate the size of corrections from higher free sectors. how-

ever, we can use the lack of degeneracy of the 2++

2

state with the 2++

0

and 2++

1

states

to estimate these corrections. according to table 5.1, the discrepancy in the various

2++ states is about 33%, if we believe the quoted lattice result. since the uncertainty

in the mass spectrum from eects of higher-order perturbative renormalization is

around 13%, an uncertainty of 30% due to the truncation of the free-sector expansion

is necessary to explain the lack of rotational symmetry in the spectrum (neglecting

the other sources of error, which we expect to be small).

as we mentioned, when we increase the number of basis functions that we use

to represent the wave functions, we nd that we reach a point where the statistical

errors from the monte carlo evaluations of the matrix elements are overwhelming and

cause our results to become completely unreliable (see appendix c). for this reason,

we have to truncate our basis-function expansion for the wave functions at nt = 7

transverse-magnitude functions. (nl = 2nt = 14, and there are 4 spin basis functions,

for a total of 392 basis functions.) this truncation results in additional errors in our

results. in figures 5.19, 5.20, and 5.21, we show the convergence of the masses of the

states with j = 0, 1, 2 respectively, as functions of nt. the masses do not decrease as

rapidly as functions of the number of states as one might expect. this is primarily

because we have already optimized the states quite a bit by determining the widths

of the transverse-magnitude and longitudinal basis functions that minimize the mass

of the 0++ state (using nt = 1). our best guess for the uncertainty that we introduce

into the spectrum when we truncate the basis-function expansion, based on figures

5.19  5.21, is a few percent16.

16technically, this is not an uncertainty because improving the states can only reduce their masses,
according to the variational principle. however, our discussion of errors is not meant to be rigorous.

128

we can estimate the uncertainty in our results associated with the monte carlo

evaluation of our matrix elements. to do this, we compute our results with  = 0.5

four times, obtaining statistically independent results, and we compute the standard

deviations of the masses that we obtain. this leads us to estimate that the uncertainty

in the spectrum from the monte carlo routine is 1  2%. this is the uncertainty that

we report in table 5.1 and figure 5.9. combining this uncertainty with the others

leads us to estimate that the total uncertainty in our results is about 33%.

the mass of the 0+ state, and we use 14 longitudinal basis functions, 7 transverse-
magnitude basis functions, and 4 spin basis functions, for a total of 392 basis functions.
using the recent anisotropic euclidean lattice result of morningstar and peardon for
the mass of the 0+ state [33], we estimate that the cuto is roughly varying from
about 3.1  6.0 gev in this gure.

conclusion

we have presented a formalism that allows the physical states of a quantum eld

theory to rapidly converge in a free-sector expansion.

in this approach, we force

the free-state matrix elements of the imo to satisfy three conditions to make the

desired expansion possible. first, the diagonal matrix elements of the imo must

be dominated by the free part of the imo. second, the o-diagonal matrix elements

of the imo must quickly decrease as the dierence of the free masses of the states

increases. third, the free mass of a free state must quickly increase as the number of

particles in the state increases.

we assume that we can use perturbation theory to derive the operators of the

theory, and if this is valid, then the rst condition is automatically satised. to satisfy

the second condition, we place a smooth cuto on the imo. we use lfft so that the

eects of the vacuum are isolated in particles with zero longitudinal momentum, and

we remove these particles from the theory with the intent of replacing their physical

eects with interactions. this makes it reasonable to expect that the third condition

on the imo is satised automatically due to the free-particle dispersion relation of

lfft.

148

the cuto that we use violates a number of physical principles of lfft. how-

ever, by requiring the imo to produce cuto-independent physical quantities and

by requiring it to respect the unviolated physical principles of the theory, we are

able to derive recursion relations that uniquely determine the imo to all orders in

perturbation theory.

we have applied our method to two eld theories. first we worked with massless

3 theory in six dimensions. we derived the recursion relations that determine the

imo and used them to calculate some second-order matrix elements of the imo. we

showed that these matrix elements naturally obey the restrictions that we have placed

on the imo and that they allow our imo to yield cuto-independent perturbative

scattering amplitudes. we then derived part of the imos emission matrix element

to third order in perturbation theory in terms of ve-dimensional integrals, and com-

puted it numerically using monte carlo methods. we used this matrix element to

derive the scale dependence of the coupling and showed how it relates to the standard

result that one nds with dimensional regulation.

the second eld theory to which we applied our method is pure-glue qcd. we

derived the recursion relations for the imo in this theory and then turned to a cal-

culation of the physical spectrum. for this calculation, we approximated all physical

states as two-gluon states. we calculated the color parts of the states analytically,

and we expanded the states momentum and spin degrees of freedom in terms of ba-

sis functions. we designed the states to be simultaneous eigenstates of the imo, the

three-momentum operator, and the projection on the 3-axis of the internal rotation

generator.

149

using our recursion relations for the imo, we calculated to second order in per-

turbation theory the two-gluon to two-gluon matrix element of the imo, which is

required for the calculation of the spectrum. we then used it to calculate the imo

matrix in terms of the basis functions. we showed that the infrared divergences in

the matrix from exchanged gluons with innitesimal longitudinal momentum cancel

when treated properly.

in order to diagonalize the imo matrix, we computed the ve-dimensional inte-

grals in the matrix elements using monte carlo methods. we calculated the glueball

spectrum for a range of couplings and found that we could not use more than about

400 basis functions without the statistical errors becoming overwhelming. we used

the mass of our 0+ glueball to compute the nonperturbative cuto dependence of

the coupling, and we analyzed the cuto dependence of the spectrum. we found that

the cuto that minimizes our errors is /m0+ = 1.33. the corresponding coupling

is  = 0.5. we presented the probability densities for our glueballs and found that

our results for the spectrum compare favorably with recent lattice data. the largest

discrepancy seems to be the 2++

2

state, which is much too light. finally, we analyzed

the errors in our calculation from the various possible sources, and estimated the total

uncertainty in our spectrum to be 33%.

there are two main paths that we can take for future work with our approach.

the rst path is to further test our method with the theories that we have considered

so far. since the scalar theory is relatively simple, it would be interesting to use it

compute the imo to higher orders in perturbation theory. this would require us to

solve the integral equation for the cuto-independent reduced interaction and could

be used to further check our conjecture that our imo leads to correct scattering

amplitudes order-by-order in perturbation theory.

in pure-glue qcd, we can further test our approach for calculating physical states

by computing the imo to higher orders in perturbation theory and by keeping more

free sectors in the expansion of the states. however, to keep more free sectors in the

expansion of the states, we have to be able to calculate imo matrices that have more

degrees of freedom, while controlling the statistical errors in the spectrum. this means

that we need a better algorithm for determining how accurately individual matrix

elements of the imo have to be computed in order to get a desired uncertainty in the

spectrum. we could also use a better basis that requires fewer momentum functions

to represent a wave function. overcoming these problems will be challenging, but it

is important to test our method by studying the rate of convergence of the free-sector

expansion of states as a function of both the cuto and the masses of the states.

another test of our method that we can do with pure-glue qcd is to analyze

the interaction that we have derived in this dissertation to test the conjecture that

it is logarithmically conning. it would also be interesting to analyze the long-range

parts of higher-order interactions to see if the perturbative series for the interaction

is building towards a linearly conning potential. analyzing the long-range parts of

higher-order interactions may be much easier than computing the interactions in their

entirety.

the second main path that we can take in the future is to extend our method to

other theories and operators. in order to compute quantities that can be compared

151

with experiment, we wish to extend our method to full qcd17. this is complicated

for two reasons. first, there is additional algebraic and numerical complexity from

the vertices involving quarks. second, quark masses complicate the method for deter-

mining the imo because they increase the number of reduced interactions that can

be cuto-independent [3]. in addition, if large and small quark masses are considered

simultaneously, then ecient numerical representation of the states and accurate cal-

culation of the imos matrix elements become more dicult. masses also quickly

enlarge the parameter space that must be explored to compare to experimental data.

we can also extend our method by applying it to the computation of operators

other than the imo, such as the rotation generators, the parity operator, and currents.

the rotation generators and the parity operator are of particular interest because they

may aid in the classication of the physical states of a theory.

in summary, there are many avenues of research that must be explored, and some

of them are quite complex. however, all the improvements that we have discussed

are necessary if we are to accurately represent the physical states of quantum eld

theories as rapidly convergent expansions in free sectors.

17we are not thinking of including qcd eects that require nonperturbative renormalization or
an innite number of particles because these would require a new method rather than an extension
of our current approach.

appendix a

particle-number dependence of free masses

the purpose of this appendix is to give a qualitative argument that shows that

in lfft, the free mass of a free state should rapidly increase with the number of

particles in the state. for simplicity, we consider the case of massless particles and

limit ourselves to analyzing free states that are components of physical states with a

single physical particle (e.g. single-glueball states in pure-glue qcd). if some of the

particles in a free state are massive, then the free mass of the state should increase even

more rapidly with the number of particles in the state. extension of our argument to

free states that are components of physical states with multiple physical particles is

straightforward.

the free imo satises the fock-space eigenvalue equation

m2

free |fi = m 2

f |fi ,

(a.1)

where |fi is any free state. we dene nf to be the number of particles in |fi. the
eigenvalue m 2

f depends on nf :

m 2

f =

~r 2
i
xi

,

nf

xi=1

153

(a.2)

where xi is the fraction of the total longitudinal momentum of |fi that is carried
by particle i, and ~ri is the particles transverse momentum in |fis center-of-mass
frame18.

let us assume that ~r 2

i is approximately independent of i. then

m 2

f  (~r 2

)typical

nf

xi=1

1
xi

.

(a.3)

this is minimized if the particles share the longitudinal momentum equally, in which

case xi = 1/nf . then

m 2

f  n 2

f (~r 2

)typical.

(a.4)

this shows that the free mass of a free state should increase at least quadratically

with the number of particles in the state. if ~r 2

i is approximately independent of i

and the particles do not share the longitudinal momentum equally (this is the most

likely scenario; see the probability densities in chapter 5, section 4.2), then m 2

f will

increase even faster with nf .19 this rate of growth should be sucient as long as

the scale of the free mass, which is set by the proportionality constant (~r 2

)typical, is

not negligible compared to the cuto.

in principle, we could choose the cuto to be much larger than (~r 2

)typical, but

instead we choose it to be such that our errors are minimized. the dynamics of the

system determine the value of this optimal cuto, and we believe that it is unnatural

for it to be much larger than (~r 2

)typical. in a conning theory like qcd, the reason

18to analyze a free state that is a component of a physical state with multiple physical particles,
we would divide m 2
f into a separate contribution from each physical particle and analyze each
contribution in terms of the associated physical particles total longitudinal momentum and center-
of-mass frame.

19note that in equal-time eld theory the free energy of a state increases only linearly with the

number of particles, assuming they have non-negligible momenta.

154

for this is particularly clear. if the typical center-of-mass transverse momentum in a

state is very small compared to the optimal cuto, then the state will have a width in

transverse position space that is much greater than the inverse of this cuto (which

is typically the size of the bound state). in a conning theory, these states should be

highly suppressed. therefore, we do not expect (~r 2

)typical to be negligible compared

to the cuto.

to conclude, in lfft, the free mass of a free state should increase rapidly with

the number of particles in the state.

proof of unitarity of u (, )

the purpose of this appendix is to prove that u(, ), as dened by

and

du(, )

d(4)

= t ()u(, )

u(, ) = 1,

(b.1)

(b.2)

is unitary as long as t () is anti-hermitian and linear. assume that t () is anti-

hermitian and linear. then a solution for u(, ) is

u(, ) = 1 +z 4
= 1 +z 4

d(4)t () +    . (b.3)

this solution shows that since t () is linear, u(, ) is linear20.

now multiply eq. (b.1) on the left by u (, ):

u (, )

du(, )

d(4)

= u (, )t ()u(, )

= hu (, )t ()u(, )i

20we assume that the expansion of the integral equation converges.

if it does not, then the
perturbative solution for u (, ) in chapter 3 is probably useless, in which case this proof is
irrelevant.

this is the same as

d(4) hu (, )u(, )i = 0,

(b.4)

(b.5)

which implies that u (, )u(, ) is independent of . since eq. (b.2) implies

that

we conclude that

u (, )u(, ) = 1,

u (, )u(, ) = 1.

(b.6)

(b.7)

now multiply eq. (b.1) on the right by u (, ):

d(4)

u (, ) = t ()u(, )u (, ),

(b.8)

and take the adjoint of this:

u(, )

du (, )

d(4)

= u(, )u (, )t ().

adding eqs. (b.8) and (b.9) gives

d

d(4) (cid:16)u(, )u (, )(cid:17) = ht (), u(, )u (, )i .

from eq. (b.2),

(b.9)

(b.10)

u(, )u (, ) = 1.

(b.11)

157

u(, )u (, ) is a function of  that is uniquely determined by eqs. (b.10) and

(b.11). therefore, since the statement

u(, )u (, ) = 1

(b.12)

is a solution to eqs. (b.10) and (b.11), it is a true statement. since u(, ) is linear

and satises eqs. (b.7) and (b.12), it is unitary.

appendix c

technical issues in the numerical

calculation of pure-glue qcd matrix

elements

in this appendix we discuss some of the technical issues involved in the numerical

calculation of the pure-glue qcd matrix elements hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji.
section c.1 we discuss how we put the matrix elements into a form that is amenable

in

to numerical calculation. in section c.2 we briey cover three topics: we show how

3 eigenvalue j can be written in terms of the glueball
3 eigenvalue j, we list a few tricks that allow us to reduce the number

the glueball state with j r
state with j r
of matrix elements that we must compute, and we present our method for estimating

how numerical uncertainties in the matrix elements translate into uncertainties in the

spectrum.

c.1 preparation of integrals for monte carlo

there are two types of contributions to hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji: nite sums
and ve-dimensional integrals. we use mathematica [32] to evaluate the nite sums

to as many digits as we wish. to evaluate the integrals, we combine them into one

integral and use the vegas monte carlo routine [29]. it takes a bit of work to put

the integral into a form that will converge.

159

there are two main diculties with getting the integral to converge. the rst

diculty is that hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jib,f
in looks divergent: as x  x, the sum in
eq. (5.130) diverges. this divergence is misleading because it actually contributes

nothing to the integral (assuming that we calculate the integral carefully; see the

discussion below). left unchecked, this false divergence prevents the integral from

converging with vegas. to rectify the problem, we want to subtract the false diver-

gence from the integrand. since it integrates to zero, this is allowed.

the second main diculty with getting the integral to converge is roundo error.

even after we subtract the false divergence from the integrand, the integrand peaks

around x = x, and in this region there are large cancellations in some of the quantities

that we have dened. to prevent these cancellations from causing roundo error,

we rewrite these quantities so that the cancellations are explicit, before we turn to

numerics.

c.1.1 subtraction of the false divergence

we begin by dening a set of variables that is natural for dealing with the false

divergence. we dene

 = x  x.

(c.1)

we change variables from ~k and ~k 

 to the dimensionless transverse variables ~r and

~w:

~r =

~w =

d
2
d
2

(~k + ~k 
~k  ~k 


),

.

(c.2)

we dene the angle between ~r and ~w to be :

160

~r  ~w = rw cos .

we also dene

r = qr2 + w2  2rw cos ,

and then we can derive a host of useful relations:

~k =

~k 
 =

~r +  ~w
~r   ~w

and

dk dk d k k (k) (k) () (2  ) =

d4 dr dw d r w (r) (w) () (2  ). (c.6)

in terms of these variables, hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jib,f

in takes the form

161

(c.8)

to avoid roundo error, we have dened simplied dimensionless versions of the

dierences of the free masses and the derivatives of these dierences:

r2(1  x  x) + w22(1  x  x)  2wr(x[1  x] + x[1  x]) cos 
r2 + w2(1  x + 1  x)2 + 2rw(1  x + 1  x) cos

w2


.

(c.9)

eq. (c.7) is now dimensionless, except for the factor in front of the integral, which

is proportional to 1/d2.

as x  x (  0), the contributions to the integrand from the rst and second
terms in the sum diverge. in the limit x  x, the contribution to the integral from
these terms can be written21

(c.10)

an examination of this integral reveals a problem: the transverse integrals are zero

and the longitudinal integrals are innite. to solve this problem, we consider what

would have happened if we had not yet taken   0. in this case, the transverse
integrals would be zero and the longitudinal integrals would be nite. thus the

  0 limit of this integral would be zero. this means that this integral is actually
zero, and we can subtract it from the full integral in eq. (c.7):

21we do not replace all the occurrences of x with x because doing so hampers the convergence of

the integral.

(c.13)

we have rewritten the integrand of hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, jiin+ex to eliminate large
roundo errors, at the expense of making it more complicated. to further avoid

roundo errors, we rewrite a few of the s(i)

q,qs:

s(1)
3,3 = cos(j)(22 + 2(1  2x) + (1  2x)2),
s(3)
3,4 =  sin  sin(j)(22[1  2x] + [1  6x + 6x2]  2x[1  3x + 2x2]),
s(1)
4,4 = cos(j)(1  2x)(1 + 2  2x).

(c.14)

note that to compute some of the trigonometric functions that appear in this integral

[such as cos(j)] in terms of the integration variables, it is necessary to use recursion

relations that dene these functions in terms of cos  and sin  so that we can use eq.

(c.5).

the integral in eq. (c.12) converges slowly. this is because it is strongly peaked

when x  x, even though we have subtracted the false divergence. to spread out
this region, we change variables from x to p where

x = x(cid:16)1  ep(cid:17) .

the integral converges nicely in this form.

c.2 miscellaneous issues

c.2.1 rotational symmetry: j  j

to compute the spectrum, we compute the matrix hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji and
diagonalize it for each value of j separately. for a given |j|, the matrices with j = |j|
and j = |j| are simply related, and we can use this fact to avoid computing and
diagonalizing both of them. by inspection, we determine that

hq, l, t,j|m2()|q, l, t,ji = xq,q hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji f (q, q)

 f (q, q),

(c.19)

where

f (q, q) = q,1q,2 + q,2q,1 + q,3q,3  q,4q,4.

(c.20)

165

this simply means that the basis |q, l, t,ji is related to the basis |q, l, t, ji by swap-
ping the states |1, l, t, ji and |2, l, t, ji, and changing the sign of |4, l, t, ji. renaming
basis states and changing their phases has no eect on the eigenvalues of the matrix;

so (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
(j)n(p )e has the same mass as |jn(p )i. it also means that since

rjn
qlt |q, l, t, ji

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)
jn(p )e = xqlt
= xlt hrjn

1lt |1, l, t, ji + rjn

2lt |2, l, t, ji + rjn

3lt |3, l, t, ji + rjn

4lt |4, l, t, jii , (c.21)

we have

(j)n(p )e = xlt hrjn

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

1lt |2, l, t, ji + rjn
rjn
qltf (q, q) |q, l, t, ji .

= xqqlt

2lt |1, l, t, ji + rjn

3lt |3, l, t, ji  rjn

4lt |4, l, t, jii

(c.22)

thus by diagonalizing hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji, we also obtain the eigenvalues and
eigenstates of hq, l, t,j|m2()|q, l, t,ji.

c.2.2 reducing the number of matrix elements to compute

there are a few facts that allow us to reduce the number of matrix elements that

we have to compute. first, because of gluon-exchange symmetry, the basis state

|q, l, t, ji is zero if l + j is even and q = 4, or if l + j is odd and q 6= 4. second, m2()
is hermitian, and its matrix elements in this basis are real; so it is symmetric in this

basis. third, by inspection, we see that

h1, l, t, j|m2()|2, l, t, ji = 0.

(c.23)

finally, there are some redundancies and additional zeros in the matrix when j = 0:

h2, l, t, 0|m2()|2, l, t, 0i = h1, l, t, 0|m2()|1, l, t, 0i ,
h1, l, t, 0|m2()|3, l, t, 0i = h2, l, t, 0|m2()|3, l, t, 0i ,

166

h1, l, t, 0|m2()|4, l, t, 0i = h2, l, t, 0|m2()|4, l, t, 0i ,
h3, l, t, 0|m2()|4, l, t, 0i = 0.

(c.24)

c.2.2 estimating uncertainties in the spectrum

when we use the vegas monte carlo routine to compute the matrix elements,

the results for the matrix elements have statistical uncertainties. in order to control

the resulting uncertainties in the spectrum, we would like to have a method that

allows us to estimate how accurately we must calculate any given matrix element in

order for the spectrum to have a desired uncertainty.

suppose a diagonal matrix element hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji is given by

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji = z  ,

(c.25)

where z is the monte carlo estimate of the matrix element and  is the associated

absolute uncertainty. using mathematica with test matrices, it is straightforward to

convince oneself that if  is small, then it will yield a relative uncertainty e

n  /z
in the eigenvalues of the matrix22. this translates to a relative uncertainty of emn 
/(2z) in the masses.

m 2

estimating the uncertainty in the spectrum due to uncertainties in o-diagonal

matrix elements is more dicult. using mathematica with test matrices, the simplest

method that we have found that is reasonably reliable is to use a type of degenerate

perturbation theory. when we have an o-diagonal matrix element given by

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji = z  ,

(c.26)

22in the development of this method, we are guided by the principles of quantum-mechanical
perturbation theory, although we cannot legitimately use perturbation theory to analyze the
uncertainties.

167

we diagonalize the two matrices

  hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji

z + 

z + 

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji ! ,

and

  hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji

z  

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji ! ,

z  

and we compare their eigenvalues to the eigenvalues of the matrix

  hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji

z

hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji ! .

z

(c.27)

(c.28)

(c.29)

we then dene e

m 2
n

to be the largest relative deviation that we have found in the

eigenvalues, and we estimate the resulting relative uncertainty in the mass spectrum to

m 2
n

/2. this estimate tends to work well unless there are too many diagonal

be emn  e
matrix elements that are nearly degenerate with either hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji or
hq, l, t, j|m2()|q, l, t, ji.

to achieve a relative uncertainty of o() in the glueball masses, we require emn < 
for each matrix element. this method tends to work reasonably well. the main

diculty is that we have neglected to consider the highly nonlinear couplings between

the uncertainties in dierent matrix elements. for this reason, as we increase the size

of the matrix, the error in our estimate of the uncertainty eventually becomes critical.

at this point, the spectrum that we get when we diagonalize the matrix becomes

completely unreliable. (the evidence of the breakdown is sudden contamination of

the low-lying wave functions with high-order components.)

it should be possible

to develop more sophisticated methods of estimating uncertainties to suppress this

problem.
