we explore quantum states of instanton solitons in ve dimensional noncommutative

yang-mills theories. we start with maximally supersymmetric u (n ) theory compacti-
ed on a circle s1, and derive the low energy dynamics of instanton solitons, or calorons,

which is no longer singular. quantizing the low energy dynamics, we nd n physically

distinct ground states with a unit pontryagin number and no electric charge. these

states have a natural d-string interpretation. the conclusion remains unchanged as we
decompactify s1, as long as we stay in the coulomb phase by turning on adjoint higgs

expectation values.

instantons and monopoles in noncommutative yang-mills

in yang-mills theories in ve dimensions, solitons carrying pontryagin charge, or real time in-

stantons, can appear. unlike their four-dimensional cousins, magnetic monopoles, the low energy

dynamics of these solitons are singular due to well-known singularities in instanton moduli spaces.

a singularity appears when any scale parameter vanishes, i.e., when an instanton size becomes

zero. this prevents a reliable computation of low energy spectra in sectors with nonzero pontrya-

gin numbers.

recently, it was realized that a noncommutative version of such yang-mills theories arises

naturally from open string propagating on d-branes [1, 2, 3]. while we will not go into details,

it suces to observe that the resulting theory can be understood by allowing coordinates to be

noncommuting variables. one eect of this is to remove very small distance scales. therefore, one

expects to nd that the instanton cannot be smaller than the size set by the noncommutativity.

indeed, recent study of noncommutative yang-mills theory indicates that small instanton singu-

larity [4] of the instanton moduli space is resolved once we deform the yang-mills theory in this

manner [5, 6, 7, 3]. naturally, this opens a way to regularize dynamics of ve-dimensional solitons.

before delving into low energy dynamics, it is instructive to understand how solitons them-
selves are deformed. easiest way to construct such deformed solitons on noncommutative r1+4

would be via the adhm construction.

in string theory context, one is considering the d0 dy-

namics inside n d4-branes. the higgs vacua of d0 parameterize the instanton moduli space of

the u (n ) theory, which can be found by solving a series of d-term conditions [4]. these d-term

conditions are nothing but the adhm equation [8].

however, a little bit more intuitive picture is obtained by considering t-dual of this when
compactied on r1+3  s1. let the radius of s1 be r. one can take the decompactication limit

r   at the end, if one wishes. the t-duality maps d4-branes to d3-branes whose worldvolumes
are parallel to r1+3 and transverse to the dual circle s1 of radius r = /r. for u (n ) gauge
theory on r1+3  s1, one has n such d3 branes. the instanton charge is given by the d-string
winding number along s1, so a single instanton corresponds to a singly wound d-string along s1.

this d-string is in general broken up at d3s, and the open d-string segments between adjacent
d3s can move freely along r3 directions. these open d-string segments can be interpreted as

fundamental monopoles [9].

as there are n such intervals, there are n fundamental monopoles, corresponding to the
roots in the extended dynkin diagram. these n solitons constitute an instanton on r3  s1, also

1

known as a caloron [9, 10, 11, 12]. the corresponding nahm data encodes the positions of the

d-string segments and gauge elds on them.

suppose we introduce noncommutativity on r3  s1, by turning on a uniform ns-ns tensor

eld on it;

[x, x] = i,

i = 1, 2, 3, 4.

(1)

the antisymmetric 2-tensor  will be assumed to be covariantly constant. the adhm formalism

of the instanton in the noncommutative yang-mills theory is developed in ref. [5, 7], where it was

shown that the adhm equation (or d-term condition) acquires a triplet of constant terms that can

be thought of as fayet-iliopoulos term of the d0 worldvolume theory in the presence of d4-branes.

this triplet of number as (a = 1, 2, 3) are related to the anti-self-dual part of  as

() =  a(cid:18)dx4  dxa 

1
2

abcdxb  dxc(cid:19) .

(2)

because we compactied one direction, the adhm system actually consists of innite number

of mirror images of d0. t-dualizing this picture to d3-d1 system, the d-term conditions become

one-dimensional anti-self-dual equations known as nahms equation [12]:

dt a
dt

+ abc[t b, t c] =  a +

n

xi=1

(t  ti) aiaa
i .

(3)

the coordinate t parameterizes the circumference of the dual circle s1, and t = tis are positions
of d3-branes along s1. we have chosen the coordinate t to have dimension of mass, while t as
have dimension of lengths, by inserting appropriate factors of , so that 0  t  2 r/. t as are

k  k unitary matrices where k is the pontryagin number. the rst term on the right hand side

comes from the noncommutativity, while the second terms reects the possibility that d-strings are
broken up along each d3. each ai is a 2k-dimensional complex vector a a
, a = 1, . . . , k,  = 1, 2,
and as are the usual pauli matrices. conventional nahms equation for calorons is recovered
when  as are taken to zero.

i

for a single instanton with k = 1 (a self-dual instanton), the numbers t a encode positions
of d-string segments along r3 directions and so the interpretation of  as are quite clear. in the
coordinates t and xas, all d-string segments are slanted with the slope of ~, as in gure 1. this

simple picture contains much of physics we need to understand about instantons and monopoles in

noncommutative yang-mills theories. (for another view of the slanted strings between d-branes,

see ref. [13].)

the d-string segments are magnetically charged with respect to the (unbroken) u (1) world-

volume gauge elds on d3s, and are nothing but non-abelian magnetic monopoles. clearly the

2

single instanton on s1  r3 consists of a collection of d-string segments that completes a singly-

wound d-string, and hence a collection of n distinct monopoles. interestingly enough, the size 

of the instanton is related to another measure of distance in the multi-monopole picture as

2 = 2r (|~x1  ~x2| + |~x2  ~x3| +    + |~xn 1  ~xn | + |~xn  ~x1|) .

(4)

the parameter  dened this way coincides with the conventional denition of instanton size in r4

when  is much smaller than r.

figure 1: n d3-branes, parallel to r1+3, are represented by horizontal lines. they are
located at specic points along s1, whose radius is 1/r. the d-string segments ending
on d3-branes are slanted toward the direction given by ~.

one immediate dierence between the commutative and the noncommutative cases is that

the right hand side can vanish only for the former. in particular, the instanton on a single d4-brane

is a u (1) instanton, yet its size is not zero; the noncommutativity blows up the small instanton to

be of nite size. for general n , the smallest possible value the right hand side can take is obtained

when d-string is connected at n  1 of n d3-branes. the right hand side is then,

where r is the radius of s1. using the t-dual relationship rr/ = 1, we nd that

2r  |2 r~/|,

minimum = 4|~|,

(6)

which persists as we decompactify s1 to go back to r1+4.

note that the two endpoints of a d-string segment is located at dierent points along r3.

each endpoint is perceived as a magnetic charge with respect to an unbroken u (1) associated with

the d3-brane on which the endpoint is located, so this means among other things that the classical

solution associated with the segment is not traceless, and so cannot be thought of as an su (n )

conguration. it is necessarily a u (n ) conguration. when n = 1, the d-string has one connected

component but its two endpoints are located at two dierent points on the d3, in particular. a
u (1) instanton on a noncommutative r3 s1 is a magnetic dipole [5]. ( see ref. [14] for the explicit

construction of the dipole term for u (2) bps monopoles.)

2 moduli space of a single instanton on r3  s1

the moduli space of a unit u (n ) periodic instanton has been derived previously in the context
of ordinary yang-mills theory on r3  s1. with a generic wilson line, the instanton actually

consists of n distinct monopoles, the sum of whose magnetic charges vanish. the moduli space of

distinct monopoles are well-understood, and one nds the following hyperkaehler metric for the

4n dimensional moduli space [9].

gtotal =

42r

e2

(cid:16)mijd~xi  d~xj + (m 1)ij(di + ~vik  d~xk)(dj + ~vjm  d~xm)(cid:17) .

(7)

~xi are n three-vectors, while i are periodic in 2. the symmetric matrix mij depends on dier-

ences, ~rij = ~xi  ~xj, only, and has the form,

1 + 1/rn 1 + 1/r12

the quantities i = 2i/r  0, with pi i = 1, parameterize the wilson line, or alternatively the

relative positions of d3-branes along the dual circle s1. the vector potentials ~vij are related to the
scalar potentials in mij by,

which is necessary for the metric to be hyperkaehler.

~imjk = ~i  ~vjk,

(9)

one way to derive this metric is to consider dynamics of well-separated n monopoles, as

in ref. [9, 15]. the above metric captures the long-range electromagnetic and scalar interactions

precisely. in cases of distinct monopoles, no short-distance correction arises, and this simple-minded

4

derivation gives the right answer. alternatively, one could start with the nahm data of a caloron,

and derive the corresponding metric in the space of the nahm data. the above form of the metric

was rst conjectured by the authors, and subsequently proven by kraan using nahm data [16],

where the moduli space is obtained by a nite hyperkaehler reduction of some at quaternionic

space.

the latter method can be easily generalized to noncommutative cases, since the only modi-
cation is via the fi constants  as. for a single instanton, all that happens is that the moment maps
are shifted by an amount proportional to  as. despite the complicated nature of noncommutative

yang-mills theories, thus, the modication of the instanton moduli space is rather simple. with

this in mind, let us consider how noncommutativity may alter the moduli space metric.

since the long distance behavior of noncommutative theories should be identical to that of

the commutative version, we expect the former method to be also informative for well-separated
monopoles. so let us concentrate on long-distance interaction between d-string segments. the ith
d-string segments appears on r3 as a pair of particles, separated by a xed vector, (ti+1  ti)~.
they are charged, respectively, positively with respect to the ith and negatively with respect to the
(i + 1)th unbroken u (1) on d3-branes; the net electric charge is (0, , . . . , 0, 1, 1, 0, . . . , 0). from

this, we can see easily that the long range interaction is modied only through the correction to

mij (and thus to ~vij) that shifts the harmonic functions 1/|~xi  ~xi+1| to,

1

|~xi  ~xi+1|



|(~xi + (ti+1  ti)~/2)  (~xi+1  (ti+2  ti+1)~/2)|

1

.

(10)

this harmonic function encodes all long-range interactions via massless elds on the (i + 1)th

d3-branes.

on the other hand, the rst n 1 such shifts can be absorbed in the denition of the cartesian

coordinate ~xi  ~xi+1s. by doing so, the only vestige of this deformation survives in |~xn  ~x1|. the

modied metric is then identical to the above except that a scalar potential in m is modied in

the following manner;

i = 1, . . . , n  1.

(12)

the vector potentials in ~vij are modied according to the relationship in eq. (9).

in the new coordinate system, ~xcm and cm decouple from the rest. the 4(n  1) dimensional

g =

(cid:16)cabd~ra  d~rb + (c 1)ab(da + ~ac  d~rc )(db + ~bd  d~rd)(cid:17) .

(24)

if and only if ~/r is nonzero, the relative moduli space is smooth. otherwise, there exists a

singularity at origin, ~ra = 0, a = 1, . . . , n  1.

while we derived this metric from the asymptotic interactions between the d-string segments,

we have many reasons to believe that we actually found the exact metric. first of all, known

moduli spaces of distinct monopoles are always such that long distance dynamics determine the

metric everywhere. furthermore, the shift of moment maps one would have considered in nahm

data approaches is exactly the shift of coordinate ~xis. in the following section, we will proceed to

solve for low energy dynamics of a single instanton with this moduli space.

6

3 low energy dynamics with or without higgs expectation

the instanton soliton breaks half of the supersymmetry present in yang-mills theory, and its low

energy dynamics is given by the sigma model with four complex supercharges [17];

l =

1

2 (cid:18)g z z + ig 0dt +

1
6

r   (cid:19)

(25)

where we introduced a two-component real fermionic coordinates  for each . actually, this

dynamics does not take into account possible higgs expectation values. we are already working
in broken coulomb vacua, due to the wilson line along s1, so have no reason to exclude adjoint

higgs expectations.

maximally supersymmetric yang-mills theory in ve dimension is written in terms of the

vector multiplet, which consists of a vector eld, ve scalar elds and a pair of dirac elds in ve

dimensions. pictorially the ve scalar elds encodes the uctuation of d4- (or d3-) branes along
the ve euclidean directions transverse to r1+3  s1 (or to r1+3  s1). in the presence of small

expectation value of a single higgs eld, the low energy dynamics is modied by a potential term.

for instance, if one of the scalars gets a vev, the lagrangian is corrected to [18],

l =

1

2(cid:18)g z z + g 0dt +

1
6

r    g gg  dg 5(cid:19),

where the killing vector eld g is dened through,

g = x ai


i

,

(26)

(27)

with eigenvalue ais of the adjoint higgs expectation in a suitable normalization. canonical quan-

tization conditions enable one to translate the supercharges to geometrical operators on the moduli

space,

q  d  ig

(28)

and similarly for its conjugate. the wavefunction is now represented by dierential forms on the

moduli space. here, ig denote the contraction of the wavefunction/dierential form with g. the

susy algebra has the central charge,

z  ilg,

which measures the electric part of the energy, and the hamiltonian,

h =

1

2 (cid:16)qq + qq(cid:17) ,

(29)

(30)

is bounded below by the absolute value of the central charge |z|. in particular, the bps bound

states without any electric charge should be annihilated by all supercharges.

7

4 counting bound states with no electric charge

let us start with a single instanton of the u (2) theory. this is the simplest case with the nontrivial

moduli space. the relative moduli space is a 4-dimensional hyperkaehler space with double taub-

nut centers.

where

and

g = u (~r) d~r2 + u (~r)1(d + ~  d~r)2,

u (~r) =   +

1
|~r|

+

1

|~r  2~/r |! ,

~  ~ = ~u.

(31)

(32)

(33)

first, suppose that there is no scalar higgs expectations, so that g  0. then the problem of nding

ground states reduces to that of nding normalizable harmonic forms on the double-centered taub-

nut. the solution to such a problem is actually well-known for arbitrary number of the taub-nut

centers; for each taub-nut centers, there exists precisely one associated (anti-self-dual) harmonic

2-form [19]. the harmonic forms can be written generally as,

d(f /u )  (d + ~  d~r) 

1
2

u ijki(f /u )drj  drk,

(34)

where f = f (~r) with certain harmonic functions in r3 spanned by ~r. two regular and normalizable

harmonic forms on the moduli space are obtained by setting by setting

f =

f =

1
|~r|
1
|~r|

+



1

|~r  2~/r |

(35)

(36)

are regular and normalizable. call them 1 and 2, respectively note that the third obvious

solution with f = 1 is actually a constant multiple of 1. thus, when the higgs expectation
(beyond the wilson line along s1) is absent, we nd exactly two bound states with the unit

pontryagin number.

both 1 and 2 consist of two lumps localized at ~r = 0 and at ~r = 2~/r. there is an
illuminating classical picture of these two lumps. the position ~r = 0 translates to the statement that
the two d-string segments are glued along one of the d3-branes. similarly ~r = 2~/r represents

d-string segments glued along the other d3. thus, the bound states at zero energy are represented

as linear combinations of two such glued d-strings.

in more general vacua with one or more higgs expectation values, these glued d-strings are
classical bound states at ~r = 0 or ~r = 2~/r with net binding energy. for this reason, we expect

8

that these two states get deformed but remain as quantum bound states, when the potential term

due to adjoint higgs expectations is turned on.

more generally, this suggests that there are n independent bound states with unit pontryagin
number in the noncommutative u (n ) theory on s1  r3. quantum mechanically, one should nd

n normalizable dierential forms, satisfying a susy condition on the 4(n  1) dimensional moduli

space. this needs a further work. here we will be content with nding the classical ground states

of the potential when we turn on one additional higgs eld.

natural candidates for classical ground states are d-string segments glued at all except one

d3-brane. such classical states are represented by points on the moduli space, where n  1 of the

following n vectors vanish,

~r1, ~r2, . . . , ~rn 1, ~rn + 2~/r.

we introduced a new notation

n 1

(37)

(38)

~rn  

~ra.

xa=1

does the bosonic potential vanish at such points? for generic vev of a single higgs, the nontrivial

part of the bosonic potential has the form [18],

v =

1
2

aaab(c 1)ab

this potential will vanish where all eigenvalues of c diverge. clearly, the point where

~r1 = ~r2 =    = ~rn 1 = 0

(39)

(40)

is one such ground state; all diagonal elements of c diverges while all o-diagonal elements are

nite. on the other hand, one can choose a slightly dierent coordinates ~r



a such that



~r
1 = ~rn + 2/r,



~r
2 = ~r1,
...



~r
n 1 = ~rn 2,

which implies

~r



n + 2~/r  xa



a + 2~/r = ~rn 1
~r

(41)

(42)

when accompanied by a related transformation for the angular part, this redenition leaves the

form of the metric invariant. in the new coordinates,





~r
1 = ~r

2 =    = ~r

n 1 = 0,



(43)

9

is clearly a zero of the potential v . repeating the exercise, we can see that zeros of v occur where
any n  1 of ~r1, . . . , ~rn 1, ~rn + 2~/r vanish. there are exactly n such points. we surmise that,
in the noncommutative u (n ) theory on r1+3  s1, there are exactly n bps supermultiplets of

states with the unit pontryagin number.

in the limit ~ = 0, the moduli space becomes singular. in the coulomb phase, at least part

of n states seems to survive. this can be seen explicitly for the u (2) case. in this limit, the two

taub-nut centers coalesce into one, and the relative moduli space becomes an z2 orbifold of the

single-center taub-nut. in the process, 2 vanishes by itself (or disappear into the orbifold point),

while 1 remains nite and well-dened. this state 1 is similar to the threshold bound states in

monopole dynamics [20]. it is not clear how many actually survive the limit for general n , but it

seems not farfetched to expect at least one of them does. the turning on higgs expectation instead

of or in conjunction with the wilson line should not decrease the number of states, and we expect

to have at least one pure instanton state in the coulomb phase of the u (n ) theory.

5 decompactication

one can take the decompactication limit by sending r  . to reach a sensible moduli space

metric in such a limit, we need to rescale the relative coordinates ~ra by

and thus

~ya = r ~ra, a = 1, . . . , n  1,

~yn  

n 1

xa=1

~ya = r ~rn ,

(44)

(45)

also. upon such a rescaling the constant piece ab gets multiplied by 1/r and can be ignored.

the remaining pieces are written as,

82

e2  xa (cid:18) 1

ya

d~y2

a + ya (da)2(cid:19) +

(pa d~ya )2

|~yn + 2~|



(pa ya da )2
|~yn + 2~| +pa |~ya|! ,

where

da  da + ~ab(~rc )  d~rb = da + ~ab(~yc)  d~yb,

(46)

(47)

remains unchanged under the rescaling. all sums are for a = 1, . . . , n  1. the resulting metric is

called the calabi metric [21].

while the details of the dynamics have changed upon r  , the ground state structure of

the bosonic potential, which becomes conning, did not. the bosonic potential still vanishes at n

10

dierent points, where n  1 of n vectors, ~y1, ~y2, . . ., ~yn 1, ~yn + 2~, vanish. thus, as long as
the theory is in the coulomb phase, there must be n independent supermultiplets of states with a

unit pontryagin number.

if one approaches the symmetric phase where the u (n ) gauge symmetry is restored, the

low energy eective potential disappears, and some of the n quantum states might disappear.

in the case of u (2), it can be seen explicitly that 1 becomes nonnormalizable while 2 remains

normalizable. it is unclear what physics is responsible for such disappearance of some instanton

states, or whether this low energy phenomenon is meaningful at all in the full yang-mills theory

context.

for the case electrically charged case with the potential, there is a recent work in the decom-

pactied limit [22].

6 summary

we explored the low energy dynamics of ve-dimensional u (n ) yang-mills theory in the noncom-

mutative setting. one may consider the noncommutativity as a convenient short-distance regulator

that allows us to discuss the quantum states of instanton solitons. we computed the moduli space

metric of a single u (n ) instanton, which is smoothed out thanks to the noncommutativity, and

wrote down the supersymmetric low energy dynamics explicitly.

in the coulomb phase, where the symmetry is broken to u (1)n by a wilson line or adjoint

higgs expectation values, there are exactly n supermultiplets of states with the unit pontryagin

numbers and no electric charge. states with electric charges in addition to the pontryagin number

can be studied with the given low energy dynamics, which we have not attempt here.
