abstract

we propose a (generalized) mass formula for a fundamental string described as a

bps solution of a d-branes worldvolume. the mass formula is obtained by using the

hamiltonian density on the worldvolume, based on transformation properties required for

it. its validity is conrmed by investigating the cases of point charge solutions of d-branes

in a d-8-brane (i.e. curved) background, where the mass of each of the corresponding

strings is proportional to the geodesic distance from the d-brane to the point parametrized

by the (regularized) value of a transverse scalar eld. it is also shown that the mass of

the string agrees with the energy dened on the d-branes worldvolume only in the at

background limit, but the agreement does not always hold when the background is curved.

1 introduction

to gain better understanding of string theories and m-theory, intersecting branes have

played an important role, and worldvolume analyses have been powerful approaches to

investigate the intersecting branes[1][2][3][4][5]. in ref.[1][2][3] solutions of worldvolume

eld theories of branes (in at backgrounds) with nontrivial worldvolume gauge elds

were obtained.

in the case of d-branes, it was shown that an appropriate excitation

of one of the transverse scalar elds is needed in order to obtain a supersymmetric (i.e.

bps) point charge solution of the worldvolume gauge eld[1]. each of the solutions was

interpreted as a fundamental string ending on the d-brane on the basis of the fact that the

(regularized) energy of each solution dened on the worldvolume is proportional to the
(regularized) value of the scalar eld, which is considered to be the length of the string.
this interpretation is also consistent with the charge conservation suggested in ref.[6] (see

also ref.[7]). these analyses are very important in that they made clear how one of

intersecting two branes is described from the viewpoint of another branes worldvolume.

in fact, however, the energy dened on the branes worldvolume does not always agree

with the target-space mass of the string, though the agreement of the two holds for the

case of ref.[1]. we can easily understand this by considering the fact that the worldvolume

energy depends on the denition of the time of the worldvolume, while the mass of the

string should not depend on it. that is, the derivation of the mass of the string must

be considered more carefully. the main purpose of this paper is to present a general-

ized mass formula of a fundamental string described as a bps solution of a d-branes

worldvolume, which holds independent of denition of its worldvolume time.

our idea to obtain the mass formula is as follows: the mass of the string does not

always agree with the worldvolume energy, to be sure, but it is also true that the two

are very close to each other, since the two give the same results at least in the cases

discussed in ref.[1]. so, we construct the mass formula in a heuristic way, by using the

hamiltonian density dened on the worldvolume, based on the invariance of the mass

under the coordinate transformations of the worldvolume. moreover, we also construct

explicitly point charge solutions (with appropriate excitations of single transverse scalar
elds) of branes worldvolumes in a curved background. there are two advantages to
consider these solutions: first, in each of the cases, the time component of the induced
worldvolume metric g00 (as well as spatial ones) becomes nontrivial, so, the dierences

since the energies of the point charge solutions are innite, (uv) regularization is needed to calculate

them.

some worldvolume solutions of branes in a curved (brane) backgrounds are discussed for other pur-

poses in ref.[8][9].

2

originating from the contribution of g00 become apparant in discussing the mass formula.
second, in each case of the solutions, the mass of the corresponding fundamental string

should be proportional to the geodesic distance from the brane to the point parameterized

by the (regularized) value of the scalar eld, and that the proportional coecient should

be an appropriate tension of the string, as discussed in ref.[10]. this requirement is very

tight. so, once we nd out the quantity which gives the mass stated above, it is expected

to be the correct mass formula, even if it is constructed by hand. we will construct it

based on this idea. (the discussion on the worldvolume interpretation of the string mass

will be given nally in section 3.)

the worldvolume theories we discuss here are the two cases: those of a test d-4-

brane and a test d-8-brane both embedded parallel to (a subspace of) the worldvolume

of the d-8-brane background[11][12] (i.e. a massive iia background). first, we present

the two reasons to choose this background: one is that this background has only one

transverse coordinate, leading to the fact that the harmonic function depends linearly

on the coordinate. only in this case, we can obtain explicitly the exact solutions of the

worldvolumes without any extra assumption (as we will see later). we note that obtaining

the explicit form is is crucial not only in order to nd out the mass formula by hand and

but for other discussions. another reason is that choosing this background, we can see

background via brane probes in ref.[13].

the supersymmetry preserved in the solutions by using superalgebras in a massive iia
 from the supersymmetry, we can conrm
that the solutions are bps states and that their target-space interpretation is consistent.

next, we explain why we choose the two worldvolume theories embedded in those ways:

this is because at least one overall transverse space is needed after embedding (test)

d-branes worldvolumes in order to obtain supersymmetric point charge solutions. in the

case of a d-2-brane (a d-6-brane), only the intersection with the background d-8-brane
on a string (a 5-brane) leads to the preservation of supersymmetry, but, there is no
overall transverse space. a d-0-brane is not adequate to this worldvolume description

since there is no world space. so, we consider the above two cases, which preserve at this

moment 1/4 and 1/2 supersymmetry, respectively.

concrete procedures are in the following: in each of the two cases we construct explic-

itly an point charge solution with an appropriate excitation of the only overall transverse

scalar eld. the consistency of the interpretation of each solution as a fundamental string

is conrmed in two ways: by discussing its behavior in the at background limit and by

in the previous paper[9] we have conrmed that the supersymmetry preserved in the solution of

branes worldvolume can be derived via superalgebras in brane backgrounds (see also [14]).

 we do not discuss bound states like (6|d6,d8) since the d-8-brane solution is singular just on the

d-8-brane hyper-surface.

3

checking its preserved supersymmetry. then, we propose the generalized mass formula,

and examine whether it gives the geodesic distance multiplied by an appropriate tension

of the string. moreover, we also discuss the condition that the mass of the string agrees

with the energy dened on the d-branes worldvolume.

the organization of this paper is as follows: in section 2 we construct the point charge

solutions and discuss their mass formula. in section 3 we give the conclusion and some

discussions on the consistency and the interpretation of the mass formula

the notations in this paper is as follows: we use mostly plus metrics for both

spacetime and worldvolumes. we denote coordinates of each p-branes worldvolume as
i, j, .. (i,j =0,1,..,p), those of 10d spacetime as xm, xn, .. (m,n=0,..,9), fermionic coordi-
nates as , , .., and those of superspace as z m . we use hatted letters ( m , m, ..) for
all the local lorentz frame indices and under-barred letters (m, i) for spatial indices (but
not time one), respectively. we denote gamma matrices as  m, which are all real and
satisfy { m, n} = 2 mn. 0 is antisymmetric and others symmetric. charge conjugation
is c = 0.

2 point charge solutions of 10d iia d-branes world-

volumes and their mass formula

in this section we construct the point charge solutions corresponding to fudamental strings

and discuss their mass formula.

the d-p-brane action in a general 10d massive iia background[15][12] takes the

form[16][17]

sdp = sbi

dp = tpz dp+1eqdet(gij + fij)

i = iz m e m

f = dv  b2

(2.2)

of the worldvolume 1-form gauge eld v where b2 is the worldvolume 2-form induced
by the superspace ns-ns 2-form gauge potential b2. c is a formal sum of worldvolume
r-forms c (r) (r=1,3,5,7,9) induced by the superspace r-r r-form gauge potentials c (r). m
is a mass parameter which is the dual of the 10-form eld strength f (10) of a r-r 9-form

c (9)[18][12]. tp is the formal (but not physical) tension of the d-p-brane which is given
by[16]

tp =

(2)p .

(2.3)

we take the background of the action (2.1) to be the d-8-brane solution given by[11][12]

ds2 = h /2dxdx + h 5/22dy2
e = h 5/4

c (9)

018 = h 

(2.4)

where x and x (, =0,..,8 ) are the spacetime coordinates parallel to the d-8-brane and
y is a single transverse coordinate.  is a nonzero parameter which cannot be determined

by the equations of motions of 10d massive iia supergravity. we note that the solution
(2.4) with  = 1 is the standard form of the d-8-brane solution since it is obtained via
t-duality from the other d-p-brane solutions[12]. h = h(y) is a harmonic function on

y. in this paper we set

h(y) = c1 +

m

|||y|,

(2.5)

which means that the d-8-brane lies at y = 0. we choose c1 > 0 and m > 0 to avoid a
singularity at y = 0 and to get a real dilaton. we note that the solution (2.4) becomes

the at spacetime metric in the massless limit

( m  0
c1  1 ( via dieomorphism).

(2.6)

the killing spinor of (2.4) has the form  = h /80 where 0 has a denite chirality, i.e.
y0 = +0 for y > 0 and y0 = 0 for y < 0.

we rst consider a point charge solution of a d-4-brane worldvolume parallel to the

background d-8-brane. since the solutions we construct here is a bosonic one, we set

fermionic coordinates  to be zero. moreover, we consider the ansatz



where r is dened as r  q4

xi = i
x5, x6, x7, x8 :
y = y(r) > 0
v0 = v0(r),

(i = 0, 1,   , 4)
constants

vi = 0

(2.7)

i=1(i)2. we note that the upper two columns of (2.7) mean
that the d-4-brane is embedded in the 1234-hyper-plane. that is, from target-space point

of view, we consider the following intersection of three branes:

 we choose  = 1 in this paper.

where y0 is a positive constant (and x9 = y).

then, since vi =  = 0, sw z

d4 does not contribute to the equations of motion, and the

equations of motion to solve are given by

lbi
xm = i[

so, let us examine more about lbi the induced worldvolume metric gij is given by

h /2  [ij + h 32iyjy] ! ,

(2.8)

(2.9)

whose determinant is detgij = h 5/2[1 + h 32(y)2]. at this moment, det (gij + fij)
arising in lbi is very complicated. however, setting the condition

iy = iv0,

(2.10)

results in the simple form of the determinant: det(gij +fij) = h 5/2. then, the equations
of motion (2.8) become the following two simple equations

i(h 32iy) = 0

i(h 21iy) = 0.

(2.11)

(2.12)

((2.11) arises from the 9th component of the former of (2.8), (2.12) from the time com-

ponent of the latter of (2.8), and the others are solved.) so, requiring the two equations
to be compatible, it needs to hold  = 1, and the two are combined into one equation
(2.13)

i(hiy) = 0.

xi

we note that the harmonic function gives nontrivial contribution to (2.13), which means

that the equations of motion of the d-4-brane worldvolume are aected by the background

d-8-brane. by using (2.5) and y > 0, the equation (2.13) is written as

(i)2(y +

c1
m

)2 = 0.

xi

(2.14)

 it is shown that no supersymmetry is preserved in this case without (2.10), by using a superalgebra
via brane probe appearing later (eq.(2.20)). so, (2.10) is considered to correspond to the bps condition.

6

we choose the boundary condition

( y  y0 (> 0)
v0  0

(2.15)

for r  , which means that the d-4-brane lies at y = y0. then, the solution is obtained,
with the following unusual form, as

y(r) = [(

(2.16)

where c2 is a constant proportional to the electric charge of the gauge eld. the electric
charge q1 is dened as [3]

q1 = zs3

d

(2.17)

where sn is the n-sphere,  is the worldvolume hodge dual and d is the 2-form dened
by dij =  1

. then, we have

ld4
fij

t4

q1 = zs3

(hdv ) = mc23

(2.18)

where n is the volume of the unit n-sphere. we note that in this denition the string
coupling gs = e is included in q1 since lbi

d4 is proportional to the inverse of gs.

since the solution has been obtained explicitly, we next give some pieces of evidence

that the solution corresponds to the fundamental string ending on the d-4-brane. first,
we discuss the massless limit of the solution (2.16). we assume here that the charge q1
is independent of m. (the validity of the assumption is discussed later.) then, in the

massless limit (2.6), the solution (2.16) with (2.18) behaves as

q1

23r2

y  y0 +
q1
v0 
23r2 .

(2.19)

the right hand side of (2.19) is exactly the solution of a d-4-branes worldvolume in the

10d at spacetime, which corresponds to the fundamental string[1]. so, it is expected to

correspond to a fundamental string. next, we check the preserved supersymmetry of the

solution by using superalgebras in brane backgrounds via brane probes[14][13][9]. the

superalgebra in a d-8 brane background via a d-4-brane probe is given in ref. [13] as

where q+
2 q is the supercharge preserved in (2.4) and mp is the worldspace
of the d-p-brane. p (0)i is almost equivalent to the conjugate momentum of vi. (the
contributions of the chern-simons term are subtracted.) substituting the solution for

the right hand side of (2.20), the superalgebra can be written as

 , q+

{q+

d4 [h 1/4(

1 + c123411

2

) + h 5/4(iy)2(

1 + cy11

2

)].(2.21)

since the three gamma matrix products y,c123411 and cy11 (arising in (2.21)) com-
mute with each other, all of them can be simultaneously diagonalized. since the square

of each matrix product is equal to the identity and each is traceless, both of the matrices
1+c123411

are projection operators. so, we conclude that the solution has

and 1+c y11

2

2

1/8 supersymmetry, hence is consistent with the target-space interpretation. this also

shows that the solution is a bps state.

now, we discuss the mass of the string. let us rst consider the energy of the solution.

for this purpose, we pass to the hamiltonian formalism as done in ref.[1]. if we assume
that v is purely electric and that only the scalar y is excited, sd4 reduces to

sd4 = t4z d5q{1  h(f0i)2}{1 + h(iy)2} + h 2(f0iiy)2  h y2

(2.22)

(where h is the harmonic function). the canonical momenta of y and vi, are dened
respectively as

t4h y

p =

i =

q{1  h(f0i)2}{1 + h(iy)2} + h 2(f0iiy)2  h y2
q{1  h(f0i)2}{1 + h(iy)2} + h 2(f0iiy)2  h y2

t4h[f0i{1 + h(iy)2}  hiy(f0jjy)]

.

(2.23)

the hamiltonian h is constructed as h  rm4 d4h where h is the hamiltonian density

given by

h = t4q{1 + h(iy)2}(1 + t 2

4 h 1p 2) + t 2

4 h 1(i)2 + t 2

4 (iiy)2.

(2.24)

we note that i is subject to the constraint ii = 0. substituting the solution (2.16)
for h, we can obtain the energy of the solution e dened on the worldvolume. we note
that for a bps solution like this case, it generically happens that the square root of h
becomes a perfect square and that the energy becomes a sum of the two parts: the part

originating from the d-p-brane and that from the string. so, we denote the rst part of
h as h1 and the second part as h2. concretely, the energy in this case takes the form
(2.25)

d4[1 + h(iy)2]  e1 + e2.

e = t4zm4

8

the rst term e1 is the energy of the d-4-brane itself, and the second term e2 is the
energy of the excitation (i.e. the string), both dened on the worldvolume. since we are
interested in the second part, we compute only e2 here. e2 is innite in this case, but if
we regularize it by introducing a small parameter , we can get the energy for r   as

e2 = t4z d3z 



= t4q1(y()  y0).

r3dr(c1 + my(r))(iy(r))2

(2.26)

that is, the energy is (again) proportional to the dierence of the coordinate. thus, we

conclude that the energy dened on the branes worldvolume does not agree with the mass

of the string in the case of d-branes in curved backgrounds. we note that this result is
rather reasonable, in a sense, in the case of g00 6= 1, because the energy has the same
transformation property as 0 under the reparametrization of 0.

now, we construct the mass formula. since it should be invariant under the reparametriza-

tion of 0, we propose the generalized mass formula m for a string described as a solution
of a d-p-branes worldvolume, as

m = zmp

dpqg00h2

(2.27)

where h2 is the second part of the hamiltonian density dened on the d-p-brane (origi-
nating from the excitation corresponding to a string).

let us calculate the mass of the string in this case, based on the formula. substituting

the solution for (2.27), we nd

m() = t4zm4

=

4t4q1

5m

d4h 5/4(iy)2 = t4z d3z 
[{(c1 + my0)2 +

c2
2}5/8  (c1 + my0)5/4].



r3dr(c1 + my(r))5/4(iy)2

(2.28)

on the other hand, the geodesic distance l from the d-4-brane (lying at y0) to the point
parametrized by y() is given by

l(y(); y0)  z y()

y0

gyydy =

4
5

m1/4[(y() +

c1
m

)5/4  (y0 +

c1
m

)5/4].

(2.29)

so, we obtain the proportional relation:

m = t4q1  l(y(); y0).

(2.30)

furthermore, we can show that the coecient t4q1 reproduces the tension of the
fundamental string correctly. to derive this, we discuss the unit electric charge for a (1,0)

(i.e. a fundamental) string. first, we review the discussion about the case of point charge

9

solutions of the d-p-brane in the at spacetime[1] (and ref.[19]). let us consider a triple

junction of strings: a (0,1) string, a (n,0) string and a (n,1) string. if the string coupling
gs is small, it holds

t
t(0,1)

=

(gs)2n2

2

(2.31)

where t(p,q) is the tension of a (p,q) string and t is the additional tension t 
t(n,1)  t(0,1). on the other hand, the solution of a d-1-brane worldvolume corresponding
to the above string junction is given in ref.[19]. in the at background with the ansatz
that x0 = 0, x1 = 1, x9 = y(1), xm = constant for m=2,..,8, and  = 0, the d-1-brane
action is written as

sd1 = 

t1

gs z d2q1 + (1y)2  (f01)2  (0y)2.

(2.32)

the solution of the d-1-branes worldvolume as the triple string junction with an electric
charge q1 is[19]

y(1) = v0(1) = ( q11

0

for 1 > 0
for 1 < 0.

(2.33)

the energy of the solution can be computed by using the hamiltonian, and the additional

tension t is also derived from this correctly. by taking into account the bending of the
(n,1) string[19], it is obtained as t /t(0,1) = (1/2)(f01)2. comparing this with (2.31), the
charge quantization condition f01 = q1 = gsn is deduced for a point charge q1 (for an
integer n). by t-dualizing with respect to the directions of xm for m=2,..,8, the charge
quantization condition for a electric point charge q1 of the d-p-branes worldvolume is
shown to be

q1 

1

(2)p1 zsp1

f0r = gsn.

(2.34)

next, we discuss the case which is related by t-duality to the case of (2.16). let us

suppose a d-1-brane parallel to a subspace of the worldvolume of a d-5-brane background,

and that some number n of fundamental strings are absorbed in the d-1-brane. (this

is also a bps conguration since 1/8 spacetime supersymmetry is preserved[20].) if we
consider a d-5-brane background solution, the string coupling gs becomes a local function
on the transverse coordinates ya (gs = e = h 1/2 where h is the harmonic function on
ya), and so is the tention t(n,1). if the test d-1-brane is put near the d-5-brane, the
string coupling gs is considered to be suciently small around the d-1-brane. so, the
equation (2.31) with gs = h 1/2 holds on the basis of the same discussion. on the other

10

hand, suppose that a electric point charge q
with an excitation of a scalar eld y9. then, the d-1-brane action is

1 is added to the d-1-branes worldvolume

sd1 = t1z d2q1 + h(1y9)2  h(f01)2  h(0y9)2.

(2.35)

if we assume the existence of the correponding point charge solution, the additional

tension due to the eld strength is derived in the same way, as

t
t(0,1)

=

1

2(t1)2  h 1(1)2 =

1
2  h(f01)2.

(2.36)

so, comparing this with (2.31) we have the charge quantization condition h 1/2f01 = ngs
for an integer n. by using the the electric induction d01 =  1
(= hf01 in this
case) it can be rewritten in a more generic form as

t1  ld1

f01

d01 = n.

(2.37)

the higher dimensional d-brane cases are related to (2.37) by t-dualities. so, we have

1

(2)p1 zsp1

d0r = n.

(2.38)

this is the generalized charge quantization condition for the point charge of the d-p-

brane parallel to the worldvolume of a d-(p+4)-brane background.

let us return to to the case of (2.16).

the left hand side of (2.38) with p = 4 is
equivalent to the charge q1 of (2.16) multiplied by 1/(2)3. so, the unit charge q1 for
a (1,0) string in this case is q1 = (2)3. that is, the unit charge is the same as the one
in the case of the at background, (this result is consistent from physical point of view,
since the unit charge q1 is considered to be independent of the background.) thus, the
proportional coecient of (2.30) for a (1,0) string is obtained as t4q1 = 1/2, which is
exactly the tension of the string. so, the quantity m dened in (2.27) certainly gives the

mass of the string correctly !

as another case, we consider the case of a test d-8-brane parallel to the background

d-8-brane. the worldvolume action is given in (2.1) for p=8. in this case, we consider

the ansatz



where r is dened as r  qp8

c (9) in sw z

xi = i
y = y(r)(> 0)
v0 = v0(r),

(i = 0, 1,   , 8)
vi = 0.

d8 does contribute to the equations of motion ( c (9)

i=1(i)2. then, combined with  = 0, only the term including
01..8 = h ). the expression of

 we note that the background elds should also be transformed by t-dualities simultaneously.

11

the induced worldvolume metric gij is the same as (2.9) except for the range of the indices
(in this case i, j = 1, 2, .., 8). setting the same condition as (2.10) makes the determinant
of (gij +fij) simple, such as det(gij +fij) = h 9/2. then, we nd the equations of motion
(2.39)

i(h 22iy) = 0

i(h 1iy) = 0.

(2.40)

so, these two equations are again compatible only if  = 1, and the equations to solve
become a single equation

(i)2y = 0.

we note that unlike the d-4-brane case, the harmonic function h does not appear in

(2.41). so, choosing the same boundary condition as (2.15), the solution is obtained

easily as

(2.43)

we note that the form of this point charge solution (2.42) is completely the same as that

of the d-8-brane worldvolume in the at background.

here, we derive the preserved supersymmetry of the solution (2.42) in the same way.

1/4 supersymmetry is expected to be preserved. the superalgebra in a d-8 brane back-

ground via a d-8-brane probe is[13]

(2.46)

by the same discussion as done in the d-4-brane case, it is shown that 1/4 supersymmetry

is preserved in this conguration, which is consistent with the spacetime interpretation.

so, we interpret the solution (2.42) as a fundamental string again.

applying the mass formula (2.27) to this case, we obtain the result:

m  zm8qg00h2 = t8zm8

d8h 1/4(iy)2

r7dr(c1 + my(r))1/4(iy)2

= t8z d7z 



= t8q

1  l(y(); y0).

(2.47)

based on the same discussion as that done in the d-4-brane case, the unit electric charge
1 = (2)7. so,
q
the tension of the string is reproduced correctly again, and (2.27) also gives the mass

1 for a (1,0) string ending on a d-8-brane can also be derived as q

of the string for the solution (2.42) correctly. therefore, we conclude that (2.42) is the

correctly generalized mass formula, which holds when the background of the d-brane is

curved. we note that the energy dened on the worldvolume again gives the dierence
of the coordinate y multiplied by t8q
1. that is, this case is another example that the
worldvolume energy does not agree with the mass of the string.

3 summary and discussions

in summary, we have proposed (2.42) as the generalized mass formula which holds when

the background of the d-brane is curved, and have shown explicitly using the two examples

that the formula certainly gives the mass of a fundamental string described as a bps

solution of a d-branes worldvolume.

in addition, based on the obtained formula, we

can see that the mass of the string agrees with the worldvolume energy only in the cases
g00 = 1 (where gij is the induced worldvolume metric). which include the case discussed
in ref.[1].

here, we discuss the consistency of the mass formula from another point of view,

especially focusing on the factor g00. suppose we consider the d-4-brane embedded

parallel to the d-8-brane background (2.4) with no excitation of worldvolume elds (i.e.
xi = i for i=0,..,4 and x5, .., x8, y : constants). then, on the analogy of the mass formula

13

of a (p,q) string given by sen in ref.[10], the target-space mass md4 of the d-4-brane
should be proportional to its spatial volume element measured by the geodesic distances

in the spacetime. so, it should be given by

md4 = zm4

d4t4eqdetg

ij

(3.1)

ij is the induced world-space metric of the d-4-brane.

where g
obtained in this way can be shown to agree with the quantity md4 dened as

in fact, the mass md4

md4 = zm4

d4qg00h1(= zm4

d4h 1/4  1)

(3.2)

where h1 is the rst part (i.e. originating from the d-4-brane) of the hamiltonian density
of the solution (2.16) dened on the d-4-brane. this means that the information of the d-

4-brane mass can also be extracted from the solution (2.16) by integrating the hamiltonian

density multiplied by the factor g00 with respect to world-space coordinates. thus,
the factor g00 arising in the formula is consistent in this sense, too.
we dene a worldvolume proper time  as d  g00d0, the hamiltonian density
multiplied by g00 might be regarded as the energy density dened with respect to  .

finally, let us discuss the worldvolume interpretation of the mass formula (2.27). if

so, we might say that from worldvolume point of view, the mass of the string is interpreted

as the energy dened with respect to the worldvolume proper time.
