(49) 18 clearly inverse action b. rooted tree one b+(b(t)) = b(b+(t)) = t, (50) fig. 8 provides one example. set b(t1) = 1, b+(1) = t1. introduce hopf algebra rooted trees taking opportunity cut trees pieces. start elementary possibility. elementary cut cut rooted tree single chosen edge, indicated fig. 9. introducing coproduct nally introduce notion admissible cut, also called simple cut. assignment elementary cuts rooted tree path vertex tree root one elementary cut. fig. 10 depicts situation. admissible cut c maps tree monomial trees. cut c contains n elementary cuts, induces map c : c(t) = n+1 yi=1 tji. (51) note precisely one trees tji contain root t. let us denote distinguished tree rc(t). monomial delivered n 1 factors denoted p c(t). denitions c, p, r extended monomials trees obvious manner, choosing cut c every tree tji monomial: c(tj1 . . . tjn) := c 1(tj1) . . . c n(tjn), p c(tj1 . . . tjn) := p c1 rc(tj1 . . . tjn) := rc1 (tj1) . . . p c n (tj1) . . . rc n (tjn), (tjn). let us establish hopf algebra structure. following {$9808042$} rst dene counit coproduct. counit e: q simple: x 6= 1, e(x) = 0 e(1) = 1. coproduct dened equations (1) = 1 1 (t1 . . . tn) = (t1) . . .
