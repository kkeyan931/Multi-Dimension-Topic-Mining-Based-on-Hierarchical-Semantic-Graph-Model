(4) now, let us consider periodic instantons x0( ) period 0 x1( ) 1 = 0+. write x1( ) = x0( 0 1 ) + x0( ) ( ) 0  (5) ( ) periodic function determined fact x0( ) x1( ) must solutions equation motion. hence, ( ) satisfy uctuation operator x0; = 2 x0, = d2 2 + v (x0). using eqs. (4) (5), one obtain ratio energy period dierences; e = 1 . (6) (7) (8) worthwhile noting right-hand side eq.(8) constant motion. since bifurcation point takes place de = 0, absolute value right-hand side equation must diverge point. means must singular function point. order singular need another zero mode dierent well-known one, i.e., x0 originated time translational symmetry. fact easily shown follows. expand right-hand side eq.(6) terms eigenstates |n > , equation becomes m| >= xn an|n >, 4 (9) ans expansion coecients prime denotes sum excludes known zero mode | x0 > due orthogonality | x0 >. | > simply written | >= xn hn|n >, (10) hns corresponding eigenvalues m. here, shown order get innite magnitude | > bifurcation point, least one hns zero.this zero mode correspond known zero mode( x0) new zero mode bifurcation point. fact numerically explored ref. . next section derive condition appearane bifurcation point action- temperature diagram. iii. condition bifurcation point mentioned previous section, zero mode satises following second-order ordinary dierential equation; d2y 2 + v (x0)y = 0. (11) since equation second order, two independent solutions; one known one, y1 = x0, another y2( ) = y1( )z y2 1( ) = x0( )z 2( ) x0 . (12) fact mean periodic instanton x0 always two independent zero modes, general y2( ) satisfy periodic boundary condition. fact, y2( ) satises physically relevant boundary condition bifurcation point. symmetry x0( ) one conjecture order y2( ) another zero mode x0( ) y2( ) must common turning points. using eq.(4), conjecture mathematically written z x+ x dx 1 (v (x) e)3/2 = 2 v (x)qv (x) e 2 v (x+)qv (x+) e (13) 5 x+ x turning points. desirable expression condition bifurcation since sides equation innite. however, one uses relation dx ( 1 qv (x) e ) = v (x) 2(v (x) e)3/2 , (14) condition appearance bifurcation becomes f (e) v (x)z x+ xs dx v (x+) v (x) (v (x) e)3/2 + v (x+)z xs x dx v (x) v (x) (v (x) e)3/2 + = 0, 2 qv (xs) e (15) xs sphaleron solution, i.e, position barrier top. easily shown values f (e) minimum energy e = emin sphaleron energy e = es positive zero, respectively, i.e., f (emin) > 0 f (es) = 0. since zeros f (e) bifurcations take place, determine type decay rate number zeros f (e) range emin < e < es; non-existence zeros means type i, one two zeros correspond type ii type iii, respectively. now, let us apply criterion (15) simple quantum mechanical model whose potential v (x) = 4 + 12 1 2 x2 4 x4 + + 1 6 x6 3 x3. (16) numerical calculation using criterion (15) yields fig. 2 shows type decay rate along potential parameter and. dashed line distinguishing type iii type cannot obtained criterion ref.  since type iii behavior vicinity sphaleron. now, let us derive previous result ref.  imposing simple restriction f (e). since sucient criterion rst-order transition derived nonlinear perturbation sphaleron, obtained simple restriction value f (e) near sphaleron; f (es ) < 0, (17) innitesimal positive number. 6 since one put xs = 0 without loss generality, two integrals eq.(15) properly expanded terms following integrals; dx 0 gn z x+ hn z 0 x dx xn x+ x(x x)3/2 , x x(x+ x)3/2 . xn (18) (19) since gn hn exactly evaluated x, expand eq.(17) increasing power series x. get rst non-zero term 5 3 v (0)2 v (0) + v (0) < 0, (20) leave irrelevant factor. result nonlinear pertur- bation method, means previous result special case condition bifurcation. iv. conclusion fact additional zero mode appears bifurcation points, derive condition eq.(15) occurrence bifurcation action-temperature diagram. using condition, one count number bifurcations allowed energy range hence, understand whole behaviour decay-rate transition. sucient criterion rst- order transition also derived imposing restriction near sphaleron, without use nonlinear perturbation  negative-mode consideration . restriction understood previous criterion condition odd number bifurcations, criterion one cannot distinguish type iii type i. hope idea bifurcation paper could generalized applicable eld theoretical models, which, however, might non-trivial. work direction progress. 7
