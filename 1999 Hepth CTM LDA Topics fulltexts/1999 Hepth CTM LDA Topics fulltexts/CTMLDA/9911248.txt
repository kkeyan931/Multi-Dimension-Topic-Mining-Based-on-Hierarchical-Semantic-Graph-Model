(a19) exactly result follows riemann reection formula (a14). thus analytic continuation riemann zeta function (a13) region < 1, given eq. (a11), implies essence < 1 one considers initial series (a13) subtraction (a16). certainly > 1 new denition zeta function (a16) cannot reduced initial series (a13), hence cannot play role eq.
