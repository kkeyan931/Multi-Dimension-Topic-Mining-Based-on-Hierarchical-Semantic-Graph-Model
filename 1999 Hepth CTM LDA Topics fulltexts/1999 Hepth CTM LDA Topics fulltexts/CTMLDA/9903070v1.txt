abstract

we investigate a relationship between the number of the negative modes

around periodic instanton solution and the type of the decay-rate transition.

it is shown that for the case of rst-order decay-rate transition the lowest

positive mode at low energy periodic instanton becomes additional negative

mode at high energy regime, while in the second-order case there is only one

negative mode in the full range of energy. this kind of analysis on the negative

modes makes it possible to derive the criterion for the rst-order transition.

i. introduction

recently, the decay-rate transition have attracted much attention in various elds from

condensed matter physics [1] to particle physics [2,3] and cosmology [4]. this implies that

it is a general phenomenon which appears frequently in nature.

since the decay rate of metastable state is expressed as

  es[],

(1)

where s[] is the euclidean action, the classical solution in euclidean space makes a domi-

nant contribution to the decay rate. at zero temperature the classical localized solution is

a bounce which has innite euclidean period [5]. as temperature increases, due to thermal

assistance a periodic solution called periodic instanton [6] plays an important role in the

decay rate, and then at higher temperature thermal activation becomes dominated, which

is described by static sphaleron [7]. the decay-rate transition means the transition from the

periodic instanton-dominated to the sphaleron-dominated regimes.

the decay-rate transition was rst argued to be smooth in quantum mechanics by aeck

[8]. after then, chudnovsky [9] has shown that it is possible for the transition to be sharp

rst-order as well as smooth second-order, and the type of the transition depends on the

shape of the potential barrier. he has also shown that the order of the transition is easily

conjectured by -vs-e plot, where  and e are euclidean period and energy, respectively.

the sharp rst-order transition takes place when (e) curve possesses a minimum at e = ec

lower than the energy of sphaleron es. based on chudnovskys observation the sharp rst-

order transitions are found at spin tunneling systems with [10] and without [11] external

magnetic eld.

using chudnovskys idea a sucient criterion for the rst-order transition is obtained

by carrying out the nonlinear perturbation near the sphaleron in two-dimensional string

model [12]. inspired by spin-tunneling problem, this criterion is subsquently extended to

the quantum mechanical model when mass is position-dependent [13].

2

recently, it is conjectured that the number of the negative modes of the uctuation

operator may change at the bifurcation point [3]. this means it is possible to determine

the type of the transition by counting the number of the negative mode near sphaleron.

the purpose of the present paper is to address this issue by analyzing the properties of

the negative mode, especially near bifurcation point, explicitly with a concrete quantum

mechanical example and to derive the criterion for the sharp rst-order or smooth second-

order transition in this context. as will be shown, the criterion derived from this viewpoint

exactly concides with that of ref. [12], in which the criterion is derived by computing the

variation of the period near sphaleron. in sec.ii we examine the conjecture of ref. [3] by

making use of the simple quantum mechanical model. it is shown that the change of the

number of negative modes at bifurcation point is really realized in this model. getting some

physical insight from this simple model, we explore the mechanism of this phenomena at

sec.iii. we will show that the number of negative modes are conjectured by considering

some relations between the classical solutions which have same period and dierent action

values. based on the anlysis of secs.ii and iii, we derive the criterion for the rst-order

transition in sec.iv, and in the nal section a brief conclusion will be given.

ii. number of negative modes and decay-rate transition:

quantum mechanical example

in this section we calculate numerically periodic instantons and eigenvalues of their

uctuation operators for a quantum mechanical potential

v () =

where  and  are some real parameters. using the criterion of ref. [13], it is easily shown

that when  = 0 the transition from classical to quantum tunneling is rst order for positive

, and in the range of 1 <  < 0 the second-order transition takes place. when  6= 0,

in the range of 2 < 9

10 the rst-order transition occurs, and we nd that in the range

3

of 2 > 9

10 there are two types of second-order transition; one is usual second-order and

the other is unusual second-order transition accompanied by a rst-order transition within

quantum tunneling region.

since the euclidean action is

the equation of motion reads

s[] = z 

0

d (cid:20) 1

2

2 + v ()(cid:21) ,

 = v (),

(3)

(4)

where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to , which implies energy conservation

in euclidean space

2 = v ()  e.

1
2

from this equation the period is expressed as

 = 2z 2(e)

1(e)

d

q2(v ()  e)

,

(5)

(6)

where 1(e) and 2(e) are turning points.

fig. 1 shows plots of potential v (), period (e), and action s() for the three types

of decay-rate transition. one can see that the bifurcation points of periodic instantions

correspond to the points of d

de = 0. the periodic instantons in the range of d2s

d 2 > 0 or ,

equivalently, de

d > 0, does not contribute to the decay rate since there are other classical

solutions with the same period and lower action.

now consider a small uctuation from the periodic instanton:

( ) = p( ) + ( ).

then, the action of eq.(3) becomes upto the second order of ( )

s[] = s[p] +

d ( ) m ( ),

1

2 z 

0

4

(7)

(8)

where the uctuation operator is

m = 

2
 2 + v (p).

let us consider the eigenvalue equation of m

m xn = nxn. (n = 1, 0, 1, 2, 3   ).

(9)

(10)

for convenience we x the zero mode as x0, so that 0 = 0.

the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the uctuation operator m can be numerically

calculated by the diagonalization method of the matrix mainly composed of fourier coe-

cients of v (p). several eigenvalues from the lowest one are plotted in fig. 2 for the three

dierent types of decay-rate transition.

it is clear that the zero mode( p( )) originated

from the time translational symmetry always exists and at the bifurcation points another

zero mode occurs, which is relevant not to the symmetry of system, but to the symmetry

in the vicinity of the periodic instanton at the bifurcation point. the periodic instantons

in the range of d2s

d 2 > 0 have two negative modes, which means that along the directions

of the negative modes in function space the periodic instanton gives maximun action value.

in the next section we will explore the mechanism on the change of the negative modes by

considering the classical solutions in function space.

iii. analysis of negative modes in function space

in the double well potential like eq.(2) the action has a lower bound in the function

space with a xed period . since the periodic instanton has one or two negative modes,

it is not a minimum in the function space but a saddle point having one or two negative

mode directions along which the action value decreases approaching other saddle point or

some minimum. fortunately in this quantum mechanical model one can nd all possible

saddle points and minima at a given period  all of which are solutions of euler-lagrange

equation. therefore, it is possible to expect what solution one can meet ultimately if one

follows a particular negative mode direction.

5

the number of negative modes around spaleron depends on the period . this fact is

easily shown as follows. the curvature of barrier top has a relation

v (s) = 2/s,

(11)

where s is the period with which the periodic instanton meets the sphaleron. then the

eigenvalue equation for the uctuation is

where

(

d2
d 2  (

2
s

)2)n( ) = nn( )

n( ) = cos(

2n



 ), sin(

2n



 )

n = (

2n



)2  (

2
s

)2, (n = 0, 1, 2,   ).

(12)

(13)

(14)

except for n = 0 case, the states are two-fold degenerated. the number of negative modes

increases with ; for example, for 0 <  < s, there is only one negative mode, and for

s <  < 2s three negative modes and so on. the increase of negative modes will be shown

to be natural in the followings.

let us consider the sphaleron solution s with a period 1 < s as shown in fig.1

(c). note that at this period there is no any other non-trivial solution. two trivial stable

solutions are + and  staying at well minima, respectively(see fig.1 (a)). the sphaleron

has one negative mode and innite number of positive modes which are two-fold degenerated.

in fig.3 all solutions with period 1 and several lowest eigenfunctions are described. it is

clear that the sphaleron solution can go to + or  by adding or subtracting the negative

eigenfunction x1. so, this situation can be described graphically in function space as fig.4.

it is certain that one classical solution can ow along the negative mode directions into the

other solutions with lower action or to the vicinity of those.

now, consider the periodic instanton p with a period 2 > s in fig.1(c). fig.5 shows all

possible solutions with period 2 and several eigenfuctions of the uctuation operator at the

periodic instantion. the periodic instanton has one negative mode(x1), one zero mode(x0),

6

and innite number of positive modes(xn, n = 1, 2, 3,   ). since the sphaleron solution s

ows along the negative mode direction(x1) to + or , this periodic instanton can not

reach exactly + or  along the negative mode direction, but go through the vicinity of

those stable trivial solutions. by the zero mode the periodic instanton is shifted without

any variation of action value, which is the time translational symmetry. the lowest positive

mode x1 connects p with the sphaleron solution and the 2/2shifted periodic instanton


p. combining all these facts one can summarize the situation as fig.6. from this gure

it is clear that the sphaleron with period 2 has three negative modes; one is x1 which

connects s with + and  like fig.4 (a) and the others are x0 and x1 which connect with

the 2/4shifted periodic instanton 

p and p, respectively. the sphaleron with the period

of 2s <  < 3s has ve negative modes. this is explained by considering the solution

composed of two periodic instanton with period /2 as shown in fig.7. thus, the additional

two negative mode x2 and x3 are the direction to the periodic instanton with half period,

p,/2 and the /4shifted half periodic instanton 

p,/2 as shown fig.7.

in the case of rst-order transition the periodic instanton can have two negative modes.

let us consider the periodic instanton p,u with period 3 (see fig.1 (f)) which has two

negative modes x1 and x1, one zero mode x0, and innite number of positive modes. in

fig.8 (a) all possible solutions with  = s are drawn. all non-trivial solutions can be

connected along x1 direction, which is shown in fig.8 (b). this gure shows that p,u has

negative eigenvalue and s and p,d have positive eigenvalue in x1 direction. as 3 decreases,

the p,u and p,d approach each other, and at the bifurcation point they have the same action

value and then disppear. when 3 increases through s, s and p,u are merging each other

and then creating a maximum s.

finally, consider the case of unusual second-order transition. all possible solutions with

period 4(see fig.1 (i)) and their positions along x1 direction in function space are described

in fig.9. in this case the p,u and p,d merge each other at bifurcation point c1 and p,m

and p,u do at bifurcation point c2, and s has negative eigenvalues in x0 and x1 directions

as well as in x1 direction.

7

from this analysis we can conclude that additional negative modes require existence of

other solutions with lower action value, which is equivalent to the situation that occurrence

of new maximum always accompanies new minima.

iv. criterion of first-order transition

in this section we derive the criterion for the rst-order transition from the fact that in

the rst-order transition the periodic instantion near sphaleron has two negative modes while

in the second-order case it can have only one negative mode. this fact can be applied to the

eld theoretical as well as quantum mechanical models. in this paper we will concentrate

on scalar eld theories. however, the extensions to the other kinds of eld theories such as

non-linear o(3) model with [14] and without [15] skyrme term are straightforward, which

will be addressed in the separate publication.

we start with euclidean action for a scalar eld 

s[] = z 

0

d z d~x [

1
2

2 +

1
2

()2 + v ()].

(15)

consider a small uctuation (~x,  ) from a periodic instantion p(~x,  ), then the action is

s[] = s[p] +

where

1

2 z 

0 z d~x (~x,  ) m (~x,  ),

m = 

2
 2  2 + v (p).

(16)

(17)

since the periodic instanton near the sphaleron can be expressed as [12]

p(~x,  ) = s(~x) + ag0(~x) cos  + a2(g1(~x) + g2(~x) cos 2 ),

(18)

where a is a small amplitude and g0(~x),g1(~x), and g2(~x) will be determined shortly, the

eigenvalue equation becomes upto the order of a2

(l + h + h )(~x,  ) = (~x,  ),

(19)

8

where

l =

2
 2 ,

h = 2 + v (s),

(20)

h  = av (s)g0(~x) cos  + a2[v (s)(g1(~x) + g2(~x) cos 2 )

+

1
2

v (s)g2

0(~x) cos2  ].

we treat the operator (l + h) as an unperturbed part. the eigenspectrum of l is

l(| sin n >, | cos n >) = (n)2(| sin n >, | cos n >).

(21)

let us assume the eigenspectrum of h as

h|un(~x) >= n|un(~x) >, (n = 0, 1, 2,   ).

(22)

the h operator has only one negative mode |u0(~x) >. from the fact that p and p/xi are

zero modes due to the time and space translational symmetry, one can determine 2 = 0

and

g0(~x) = u0(~x),

g1(~x) = 

g2(~x) = 

1
4
1
4

h1u2

0(~x)v (s),

(h + 42)1u2

0(~x)v (s).

(23)

the zero modes of the unperturbed part or the uctuation operator at sphaleron are

|u0 sin  >, |u0 cos  >, and |um >, (m = 1, 2,    d). when the perturbation h  turns

on, only the second zero mode |u0 cos  > can be shifted from zero while other zero modes

does not aected by the perturbation because these zero modes are relavant to systems

symmetries, i.e., the time and space translational symmetries.

therefore, using the standard perturbation theory, we can determine the number of

negative modes in the vicinity of sphaleron. let 0 and 1 be the perturbed eigenvalues of

|u0 sin  > and |u0 cos  >, respectively. then, when 1  0 < 0 the number of negative

9

mode becomes two, so that the transition is rst order. the criterion for the rst-order

transition is, then, straightforwardly derived as

< u0|g2v  +

1
4

v g2

0|u0 > 

1
2

< u0|g0v h1g0v |u0 > < 0.

(24)

one can easily show that eq.(24) coincides with the criterion for the rst-order transition

in ref. [12] which is obtained from a dierent point of view.

v. conclusion

we investigate a relationship between the number of the negative modes around peri-

odic instanton solution and the type of the decay-rate transition.

it is shown explicitly

by calculating the several eigenvalues numerically in quantum mechanical model that the

number of the negative modes is changed at the bifurcation points. the mechanism of this

phenomenon in the various types of phase diagram is discussed at sec.iii by considering the

projection of the compact action manifold in function space. this kind of analysis makes it

possible to derive the criterion for the sharp rst-order or smooth second-order transition

from classical to quantum tunneling regimes. although our derivation of criterion is exactly

same with that of ref. [12], in which the criterion is derived from completely dierent point

of view, the viewpoint used in this paper seems to provide a more profound understanding

on the tunneling phenomena. we hope the relation of negative modes of hessian and the

type of the transition explored in this paper furnishes some physical insight to understand

more complicated tunneling phenomena in electroweak theory and cosmology.
