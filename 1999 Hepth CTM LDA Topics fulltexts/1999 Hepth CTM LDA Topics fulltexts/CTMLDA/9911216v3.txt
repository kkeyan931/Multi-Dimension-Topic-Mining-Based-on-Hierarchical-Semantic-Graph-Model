abstract

we compute the spectrum and several critical amplitudes of the
two dimensional ising model in a magnetic eld with the transfer
matrix method. the three lightest masses and their overlaps with the
spin and the energy operators are computed on lattices of a width
up to l1 = 21.
in extracting the continuum results we also take
into account the corrections to scaling due to irrelevant operators. in
contrast with previous monte carlo simulations our nal results are
in perfect agreement with the predictions of s-matrix and conformal
eld theory. we also obtain the amplitudes of some of the subleading
corrections, for which no s-matrix prediction has yet been obtained.

1 introduction

in these last years there has been much progress in the study of 2d spin
models in the neighbourhood of critical points. the scaling limit of such
models is described in general by the action a obtained by perturbing the
conformal eld theory (cft) which describes the critical point with one (or
more) of the relevant operators which appear in the spectrum of the cft.

a = a0 + z d2x (x)

(1)

where a0 is the action of the cft at the critical point [1] and (x) is the
perturbing operator. few years ago a. zamolodchikov in a seminal paper [2]
suggested that in some special cases these perturbed theories are equivalent
to relatively simple quantum eld theories [3] whose mass spectrum and s-
matrix are explicitly known. later it was realized that these theories had
a deep connection with the dynkin diagrams of suitable lie algebras and,
from the exact knowledge of the s-matrix, several other informations, and
in particular some critical amplitudes were obtained (for a review, see for
instance [4]). while these results have formally the status of conjectures,
they successfully passed in these last years so many tests that they are now
universally accepted. the most fascinating example of these s-matrix models
is the ising model perturbed by an external magnetic eld, which is also the
model which was originally studied by zamolodchikov in [2]. this model is
highly non-trivial. its spectrum contains 8 stable scalar particles, all with
dierent masses. both the masses and the entries of the s-matrix are based
of the numerology of the e8 exceptional lie algebra. in particular the ratio
between the rst two masses is predicted to be the golden ratio m2/m1 =
2 cos( 
5 ). the simplest realization of this qft is the 2d ising model at  = c
in presence of an external magnetic eld h. however there are several other
models which belong to the same universality class. in particular, the rst
numerical check of the predictions of [2] was performed on the ising quantum
spin chain [5] in which the rst few states of the spectrum were precisely
observed. another interesting realization was presented in [6, 7], where the
dilute a3 irf (interaction round a face) model was solved exactly and the
predicted spectrum of states was found [7].

despite these successes, little progress has been achieved in testing zamolod-

chikovs proposal directly in the 2d ising spin model. even more, it is exactly

1

for this model that one faces the only existing discrepancy between zamolod-
chikovs results and monte carlo simulations.

the ising spin model in a magnetic eld was studied numerically in [8, 9].
in both papers the authors studied the spin-spin correlator and did not nd
the spectrum predicted by [2]. their data were compatible with the presence
in the spectrum of only the lowest mass state. the explanation suggested
in [8, 9] was that probably the higher masses had a negligible overlap am-
plitude with the spin operator. however, later, in [10] these overlaps were
evaluated explicitly in the s-matrix framework and turned out to be of the
same order of magnitude as the overlap with the lowest mass state.

in this paper we shall address this problem. we shall show that zamolod-
chikovs proposal (and the calculations of [10]) is correct also in the case of
the 2d ising spin model and that the apparent disagreement was due to the
fact that it is very dicult to extract a complex spectrum from a multi-
exponential t to the spin-spin correlator. we have been prompted to this
explanation by another example that we recently studied, in which exactly
the same phenomenon happens: the 3d ising model [11]. in this case also, a
multi-exponential t to the spin-spin correlator seems to indicate the pres-
ence of a single state in the spectrum, while using a suitable variational
method and diagonalizing a set of improved operators one can clearly see the
rich spectrum of the model.

while in previous numerical works [8, 9] the model was studied by using
monte carlo simulations we tried in the present paper a dierent approach
based on the exact diagonalization of the transfer matrix.

this approach has various advantages: it gives direct access to the mass
spectrum of the model and allows to obtain numerical estimates of various
quantities with impressively small uncertainties. however it has the serious
drawback that only transfer matrices of limited size can be handled and it
is dicult to extract from them the continuum limit results in which we are
interested. during the last years various strategies have been elaborated to
attack this problem, but all of them are aected by systematic errors whose
size is in general unknown.

in this paper we propose a new approach based on the fact that, by using
the exact solution of the ising model at the critical point, one can construct
very precise expansions for the scaling functions in powers of the perturbing
eld. more precisely, thanks to the knowledge of the spectrum of the model,
it is possible to list all the irrelevant elds which may appear in the eective

2

hamiltonian and select them on the basis of the symmetry properties of the
observables under study.

our strategy could be summarized as follows.

 choose a set of values of h for which the correlation length is much
smaller than the maximum lattice size that we can study1. diagonalize
the transfer matrix for various values of the transverse size of the lattice
and extract all the observables of interest.

 extrapolate the numbers thus obtained to the thermodynamic limit.
thanks to the very small correlation length, the nite size behaviour is
dominated by a rapidly decreasing exponential and the thermodynamic
limit can be reached with very small uncertainties (we list in a set of
tables at the end of the paper the results that we obtained in this way).

 construct for each observable the scaling function keeping the rst 7

or 8 terms in the expansion in powers of the perturbing eld.

 fit the data with these truncated scaling functions. by varying the
the number of input data and of subleading terms used in the scaling
functions we may then obtain a reliable estimate of the systematic
deviations involved in our estimates (see the discussion in sect.6).

which are the observables of interest mentioned above?
usually, when looking at the scaling regime of statistical models one
can study only adimensional amplitude ratios which are the only quanti-
ties which, thanks to universality, do not depend on the details of the lattice
models, but only on the features of the underlying qft. however the ising
model can be solved exactly at the critical point also on the lattice and ex-
plicit expressions for the spin-spin and energy-energy correlators are known.
this allows to write the explicit expression in lattice units of the amplitudes
evaluated in the framework of the s-matrix theory. thus one is able to pre-
dict not only adimensional amplitude ratios but also the values of the critical
amplitudes themselves. this greatly enhances the predictive power of the s-
matrix theory and makes much more stringent the numerical test that we
perform.

1in particular we decided to keep the ratio 
l0

< 0.1. this means that we only studied

values of h for which the correlation length was smaller than two lattice spacings.

3

the nal result of our analysis is that all the observables that we can

measure perfectly agree with the s-matrix predictions.

in particular we obtain very precise estimates for the rst three masses,
for several critical amplitudes and, what is more important, for the overlap
amplitude of the rst two masses with the spin and energy operators, a result
which had never been obtained before.

we also measure the amplitude of some of the subleading corrections in
the scaling functions, for which no s-matrix prediction exists for the moment.
in particular we found that the amplitude of the corrections due to the energy
momentum tensor in translationally invariant observables is compatible with
zero.

this paper is organized as follows. in sect. 2 we introduce the model in
which we are interested, collect some known results from s-matrix theory
and nally give the translation in lattice units of the critical amplitudes
evaluated in the s-matrix framework.
in sect. 3 we construct the scaling
functions. this only requires the use of very simple and well known results
of conformal field theory. notwithstanding this it turns out to be a rather
non trivial exercise. since it could be a result of general utility (it could be
extended to other models for which the cft solution is known or to other
quantities of the ising model in a magnetic eld that we have not studied in
the present paper) instead of simply giving the results, we derived the scaling
functions explicitly and tried to give as much details as possible. sect. 4 is
devoted to a description of the transfer matrix method. in sect. 5 we deal
with the thermodynamic limit while in sect. 6 we analyze the transfer matrix
results and give our best estimates for the critical amplitudes in which we
are interested. sect. 7 is devoted to some concluding remarks.

to help the reader to reproduce our analysis (or to follow some alternative
tting procedure) we list in four tables at the end of the paper the data that
we obtained with the transfer matrix approach.

2 ising model in a magnetic eld

in this section we shall review the existing theoretical informations on the
ising model in a magnetic eld. this will require four steps. first (in
sect. 2.1) we shall dene the lattice version of the model, discuss its action
and dene the observables in which we shall be interested in the following.

4

then (in sect. 2.2) we shall turn to the continuum version of the theory,
described in the present case by the action:

a = a0 + hz d2x (x)

(2)

where (x) is the perturbing operator. in particular we shall discuss, within
the framework of the renormalization group, the expected scaling behaviour
of the various quantities of interest and dene the corresponding critical
amplitudes. in sect. 2.3 we shall use the knowledge of the s-matrix of the
model to obtain the value of some of the amplitudes of interest by using
the thermodynamic bethe ansatz (tba) and the form factor approach.
finally in sect. 2.4 we shall turn back to the lattice model and show how the
continuum results can be translated in lattice units.

2.1 the lattice model

the lattice version of the ising model in a magnetic eld is dened by the
partition function

z = xi=1

e(phn,mi nm+hpn n)

(3)

where the eld variable n takes the values {1}; n  (n0, n1) labels the sites
of a square lattice of size l0 and l1 in the two directions and hn, mi denotes
nearest neighbour sites on the lattice. in our calculations with the transfer
matrix method we shall treat asymmetrically the two directions. we shall
denote n0 as the time coordinate and n1 as the space one. the number of
sites of the lattice will be denoted by n  l0l1. in the thermodynamic limit
both l0 and l1 must go to innity and only in this limit we may recover the
results of the continuum theory. in our actual calculations with the transfer
matrix method we shall study nite values of l1 and then extrapolate the
results to innity. this extrapolation induces systematic errors which are
the main source of uncertainty of our results, since the rounding errors in the
transfer matrix diagonalization are essentially negligible. in sect. 6 below,
we shall discuss these systematic errors and estimate their magnitude.

in order to select only the magnetic perturbation, the coupling  must

be xed to its critical value

 = c =

2

log (2 + 1) = 0.4406868...

5

by dening hl = ch we end up with

z(hl) = xi=1

ecphn,mi mm+hlpn n

.

(4)

hl denotes the lattice discretization of the magnetic eld h which appears
in the continuum action eq. (2). it must be, for symmetry reasons, an odd
function of h.

2.1.1 lattice operators

it is useful to dene the lattice analogous of the spin and energy operators
of the continuum theory. they will correspond to linear combinations of
the relevant and irrelevant operators of the continuum theory with suitable
symmetry properties with respect to the z2 symmetry of the model (odd for
the spin operator and even for the energy one). near the critical point this
linear combination will be dominated by the relevant operator and the only
remaining freedom will be a conversion constant relating the continuum and
lattice versions of the two operators (we shall nd this constants in sect. 2.5).
the simplest choices for these lattice analogous are

 spin operator

l(x)  x

(5)

i.e. the operator which associates to each site of the lattice the value
of the spin at that site.

 energy operator

l(x) 

1
4

x  xy n.n. x

y!  b

(6)

where the sum runs over the four nearest neighbour sites y of x. b
represents a constant bulk term which we shall discuss below.

the index l indicates that these are the lattice discretizations of the contin-
uous operators. we shall denote in the following the normalized sum over all
the sites of these operators simply as

l

n xx

l(x)

l(x)

2.1.2 observables

 free energy

the free energy is dened as

f (hl) 

1
n

log(z(hl))

.

(8)

it is important to stress that f (hl) is composed by a bulk term fb(hl)
which is an analytic even function of hl and by a singular part fs(hl)
which contains the relevant informations on the theory as the critical
point is approached. the continuum theory can give informations only
on fs. the value of fb(0) can be obtained from the exact solution of
the lattice model at hl = 0,  = c (see [12])

fb =

2g

log 2 = 0.9296953982...

(9)

where g is the catalan constant.

 magnetization

the magnetization per site m(hl) is dened as

m(hl) 

1
n


hl

(log z(hl)) =

1

n hxi

.

ii

hence we have

m(hl) = hli

.

 magnetic susceptibility

the magnetic susceptibility  is dened as

(hl) 

m(hl)

hl

.

 internal energy

we dene the internal energy density e(hl) as

e(hl) 

1

2n h xhn,mi

nmi

.

7

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

as for the free energy, also in this case one has a bulk analytic contri-
bution eb(hl) which is an even function of hl. let us dene b  eb(0).
the value of eb(0) can be easily evaluated (for instance by using
kramers-wannier duality) to be b = 12. let us dene e(hl) 
e(hl)  b, we have

e(hl) =

1

2n h xhn,mi

nmi 

1
2

.

hence we have

e(hl) = hli

.

(14)

(15)

as usual the internal energy can also be obtained by deriving the free
energy with respect to . however it is important to stress that, due
to the magnetic perturbation (see eq.(3)) in performing the derivative
we also extract from the boltzmann factor a term proportional to hl.
hence we have:

e(hl) =

1
2n




(log z(hl)) 

hl
2c

l

.

(16)

this observation will play an important role in the following.

2.1.3 correlators

we are interested in the spin-spin and in the energy-energy connected corre-
lators dened as

g,(r)  hl(0)l(r)i  hli2  hl(0)l(r)ic
g,(r)  hl(0)l(r)i  hli2  hl(0)l(r)ic

,

.

(17)

(18)

for a nonzero magnetic eld these correlators are very complicated, unknown,
functions of h and r, however a good approximation in the large distance
regime r   is2

g(r)

hli2 = xi

i (h)|2
|f 


k0(mi(h)r)

(19)

2for a discussion of the limits of this approximation and of the corrections which must

be taken into account when the short distance regime is approached see [13].

8

where the sum is over the low laying single particle states of the spectrum,
mi(h) denotes their mass the functions f 
i (h) their overlap with the  oper-
ator. similarly we have

g(r)

hli2 = xi

i (h)|2
|f 


k0(mi(h)r)

(20)

where the spectrum is the same as for the spin-spin correlator but the overlap
constants are dierent.

a particular role is played by the lowest mass m1 which gives the dom-
inant contribution in the large distance regime. its inverse corresponds to
the (exponential) correlation length  of the model and sets the scale for
all dimensional quantities in the model.
in particular the large distance
regime mentioned few lines above means large with respect to the correla-
tion length.

in the approximation of eqs. (19) and (20) one is neglecting the cut-type
contributions which appear above the two-particle threshold i.e. at twice the
value of m1. for this reason we shall concentrate in the following only on
the three rst states of the spectrum which are the only ones which lie below
such threshold (see eq. (40) below).

2.1.4 time slice correlators

it is very useful to study the zero momentum projections of the above de-
ned correlators. they are commonly named time slice correlators. the
magnetization of a time slice is given by

sn0 

1

l1 xn1

(n0,n1)

.

the time slice correlation function is then dened as

g0

( )  xn0 {hsn0sn0+i  hsn0i2}

(21)

(22)

where the index 0 indicates that this is the zero momentum projection of the
original correlator. starting from eq. (19) it is easy to show that in the large
 limit g0

( ) behaves as

g0
( )
hli2

= xi

i (h)|2
|f 
mi(h)l1

9

emi(h)||

.

(23)

a similar result, with the obvious modications, holds also for g0

,.

2.2 critical behaviour

in this section we discuss the critical behaviour of the model by using stan-
dard renormalization group methods, keeping in the expansions only the rst
order in the perturbing eld. both the results and the analysis are well known
and can be found in any textbook. we report it here since it will serve us
as a starting point for the more rened analysis which we shall perform in
sect. 3 below.

2.2.1 critical indices

the starting point of the renormalization group analysis is the singular part
of the free energy fs(t, h) (where t is the reduced temperature). standard
renormalization group arguments (see for instance [14]) allow to write fs in
terms of a suitable scaling function :

fs(t, h) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

uh

uh0(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

d/yh

 

ut/ut0

|uh/uh0|yt/yh!

(24)

where ut0 and uh0 are reference scales that depend on the model. uh and ut
denote the scaling variables associated to the magnetic and energy operators
respectively and yh, yt are their rg-exponents. ut and uh do not exactly
coincide with t and h but are instead analytic functions of them. the only
constraint is that they must respect the z2 parity of t and h . near the
critical point we may suitably rescale  so as to identify ut = t and uh = h.
thus, setting t = 0 we immediately obtain the asymptotic critical behaviour
of fs

fs  |h|d/yh

.

(25)

taking the derivative with respect to h (or t) and then setting t = 0 we
can obtain from eq. (24) also the asymptotic critical behaviour of the other
observables in which we are interested

m  |h|d/yh1
  |h|d/yh2

10

(26)

(27)

e  |h|(dyt)/yh

.

(28)

from the exact solution of the ising model at the critical point we know
8 and yt = 1. inserting these values in the above expressions we

m  |h|

the masses mi have as scaling exponent, as usual, 1/yh, hence

mi  |h|

8

15

.

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

finally from the denitions of eqs. (19) and (20) we see that the overlap

amplitudes behave as adimensional constants.

2.2.2 critical amplitudes

in order to describe the scaling behaviour of the model we also need to know
the proportionality constants in the above scaling functions. these constants
are usually called critical amplitudes. using the results collected in eqs. (29)-
(32) we have the following denitions:

m h 1

15 ,

af  lim
h0

f h 16

15 ,

am  lim
h0
e h 8

15 ,

ae  lim

15 ,

(34)

(35)

(36)

ami  lim
h0
i  lim
af

f

.

notice for completeness that in the literature (see for instance [15]) the

amplitudes a, am and am1 are usually denoted as

a  c , am  d 1

c

15

, am1 

1
c

.

(37)

11

we shall show in the next section that all these amplitudes can be exactly
evaluated in the framework of the s-matrix approach. as a preliminary step
let us notice that since m and  are obtained as derivatives of f we have

am =

16
15

af ,

a =

1
15

am .

(38)

2.2.3 universal amplitude ratios

from the above critical amplitudes one can construct universal combinations
which do not depend on the particular realization of the model. for this
reason they have been widely studied in the literature. in particular there are
two classical amplitude combinations which involve the critical amplitudes
dened above (see for instance [15]). they are:

r  dcb14

q2  (/c)(c/0)

7

4

(39)

where we used the notations of eq. (37).  and 0 denote the critical ampli-
tudes of the susceptibility and exponential correlation length for h = 0 and a
small positive reduced temperature, while b denotes the critical amplitude
of the magnetization for h = 0 and a small negative reduced temperature.
notice however that, since (as we mentioned in the introduction) we are
able to give the explicit relation between lattice and continuum expectation
values, we are not constrained to study only universal combination but can
determine exactly the various critical amplitudes.

2.3 s-matrix results

in 1989 a. zamolodchikov [2] suggested that the scaling limit of the ising
model in a magnetic eld could be described by a a scattering theory which
contains eight dierent species of self-conjugated particles aa, a = 1, . . . , 8

where m1(h) is the lowest mass of the theory. as mentioned above it coincides
with the inverse of the (exponential) correlation length. few years later, from
the knowledge of the s-matrix of the theory v. fateev [16] obtained explicit
predictions for some of the critical amplitudes dened above.

in order to evaluate the amplitudes one must rst x the normalization of
the operators involved which can be set, for instance, by xing the constant
in front of the long distance behaviour of the correlators at the critical point.
it is important to make explicit this normalization choice, since it will allow
us, by comparing with the corresponding correlators in the lattice theory to
convert explicitly the continuum results in lattice units. following the choice
of [16] we assume:

h(x)(0)i =

h(x)(0)i =

am = lim

15 .

(48)

in order to relate the lattice results with the continuum ones we must
study the relationship between the lattice operators and the continuum ones.
in general the lattice operators will be given by the most general combina-
tion of continuum operators compatible with the symmetries of the lattice
operator multiplied by the most general analytic functions of t and h (with a
parity which is again constrained by the symmetry of the operators involved).
thus, for instance, anticipating the discussion that we shall make in sect. 3,
we have

l = f 

0 (t, h) + fi(t, h)i

(49)

where f 

0 (t, h) and fi(t, h) are suitable functions of t and h and with i we

15

denote all the other elds of the theory (both relevant and irrelevant) which
respect the symmetries of the lattice.

a similar relation also holds for the energy operator:

l = g

0(t, h) + gi(t, h)i

.

(50)

finally, also hl is related to the continuum magnetic eld h by a relation

of the type

hl = b0(t, h)h

(51)

where b0(t, h) must be an even function of h .

at the rst order in t and h these combinations greatly simplify and es-
sentially reduce to a dierent choice of normalization between the continuum
operators and their lattice analogous:

l  r ,

l  r ,

hl  rhh

(52)

0 , g

0 and b0 functions.

where r, r and rh are three constants which correspond to the h  0,
t  0 limit of the f 
if we want to compare the s-matrix results discussed in the previous sec-
tion with our lattice results we must x these normalizations3. the simplest
way to do this is to look at the analogous of eqs. (41,42) at the critical point
(namely for hl = 0) [20] .

in fact, if hl = 0 it is possible to obtain an explicit expression for the
spin-spin and energy-energy correlators (for a comprehensive review see for
instance [21]) directly on the lattice, for any value of . choosing in par-
ticular  = c, and looking at the large distance behaviour of these lattice
correlators we may immediately x the normalization constants. let us look
rst at r.

we know from [22] that:

hijih=0 =

r2

|rij|1/4

(53)

where rij denotes the distance on the lattice between the sites i and j and

r2

 = e3(1)25/24 = 0.70338... .

(54)

3this essentially amounts to measure all the quantities in units of the lattice spacing.

for this reason we can x in the following the lattice spacing to 1 and neglect it.

16

by comparing this result with eq. (41) we nd

r = 0.83868...

.

(55)

from this we can also obtain the normalization of the lattice magnetic
eld which must exactly compensate that of the spin operator in the pertur-
bation term h. we nd:

rh = (r)1 = 1.1923...

.

(56)

combining these two results we obtain the value in lattice units of the

constant a

al

m = (r)16/15am = 1.058...

.

(57)

from this one can easily obtain also al

f , al

 and am1.

let us look now at r. in the case of the energy operator the connected
correlator on the lattice, at hl = 0 and for any value of  has the following
expression [23]:

!2
hl(0)l(r)ic =   

hk 2
1 (r)  k 2

0 (r)i

(58)

where k0 and k1 are modied bessel functions,  is a parameter related to
the reduced temperature, dened as

 = 4|  c|

(59)

and with the index c we denote the connected correlator (notice that thanks
to the denition (14) no disconnected part must be subtracted at the critical
point and the index c becomes redundant). this expression has a nite value
in the   0 limit (namely at the critical point). in fact the bessel functions
dierence can be expanded in the small argument limit as

hk 2
1 (r)  k 2

0 (r)i =

1
(r)2 + ...

thus giving, exactly at the critical point:

hl(0)l(r)i =

2.4.1 alternative derivation of r

in this section we discuss, for completeness, an alternative derivation of r.
it can be used in those cases in which the correlators are not known, but the
internal energy is known on a nite size lattice at the critical point. then
r can be obtained by comparing the nite size behaviour of the internal
energy on the lattice with that predicted by conformal eld theory in the
continuum. in the case of the ising model, thanks to the beautiful work by
ferdinand and fisher [12], we know that on a square lattice of size l0  l1
with l0 > l1 with periodic boundary conditions the internal energy must
scale as:

hli =

2( )3( )4( )

2( ) + 3( ) + 4( )

1
l1

(64)

.

l1

where i( ) denotes the ith jacobi theta function and   i l0
cft techniques. the result [24] is

the same behaviour can be studied in the continuum theory, by using

hi =

1( )

2( ) + 3( ) + 4( )

1
l1

.

(65)

18

by using the relation

1( ) =  2( )3( )4( )

(66)

which allows to express the derivative of the 1( ) in terms of ordinary theta
functions we see that the two equations (64) and (65) agree only if we choose,
as we did in the previous section, r = 1
 .

3 scaling functions

in this section we shall construct the scaling functions for the various quan-
tities in which we are interested. our aim is to give the form (i.e. the value
of the scaling exponents) of the rst 7-8 terms of the expansion in powers of
h of the scaling functions and at the same time to identify the operators in
the lattice hamiltonian from which they originate. to this end we shall rst
deal in sect. 3.1 with the theory at the critical point. we shall in particular
discuss its spectrum, which can be constructed explicitly by using cft tech-
niques. next, in sect. 3.2, we discuss in the framework of the renormalization
group approach the origin of the subleading terms in the scaling functions,
and show how to obtain their exponents from the knowledge of the renor-
malization group eigenvalues yi of the irrelevant operators. while in general
this analysis is only of limited interest since the yi of the irrelevant operators
are unknown, in the present case, thanks to the cft solution discussed in
sect. 3.1, it becomes highly predictive and will allow us to explicitly construct
in sects. 3.3 and 3.4 the scaling functions. in particular in sect. 3.3 we shall
list all the irrelevant operators which may appear in the eective hamiltonian
and discuss their symmetry properties, while in sect. 3.4 we shall write the
scaling functions and identify the operators involved in the various scaling
terms.

3.1 the ising model at the critical point

the ising model at the critical point is described by the unitary minimal
model with central charge c = 1/2 [1].
its spectrum can be divided into
three conformal families characterized by dierent transformation properties
under the dual and z2 symmetries of the model. they are the identity, spin

19

and energy families and are commonly denoted as [i], [], []. let us discuss
their features in detail.

 primary elds

each family contains a relevant operator which is called primary eld
(and gives the name to the entire family). their conformal weights
are hi = 0, h = 1/16 and h = 1/2 respectively. the relationship
between conformal weights and renormalization group eigenvalues is:
y = 2  2h. hence the relevant operators must have h < 1.

 secondary elds

all the remaining operators of the three families (which are called sec-
ondary elds) are generated from the primary ones by applying the
generators li and li of the virasoro algebra. in the following we
shall denote the most general irrelevant eld in the [] family (which
are odd with respect to the z2 symmetry) with the notation i and
the most general elds belonging to the energy [] or to the identity
[i] families (which are z2 even) with i and i respectively. it can be
shown that by applying a generator of index k: lk or lk to a eld
 (where  =, i, ,  depending on the case) of conformal weight h we
obtain a new operator of weight h = h + k. in general any combina-
tion of li and li generators is allowed, and the conformal weight of
the resulting operator will be shifted by the sum of the indices of the
generators used to create it. if we denote by n the sum of the indices
of the generators of type li and with n the sum of those of type li
the conformal weight of the resulting operator will be h + n + n. the
corresponding rg eigenvalue will be y = 2 2h  n n, hence all the
secondary elds are irrelevant operators.

 nonzero spin operators

the secondary elds may have a non zero spin, which is given by the
dierence n  n. in general one is interested in scalar quantities and
hence in the subset of those irrelevant elds which have n = n. however
on a square lattice the rotational group is broken to the nite subgroup
c4 (cyclic group of order four). accordingly, only spin 0, 1, 2, 3 are
allowed on the lattice. if an operator  of the continuum theory has
spin j  n, then its lattice discretization l behaves as a spin j (mod 4)

20

operator with respect to the c4 subgroup. as a consequence all the
operators which in the continuum limit have spin j = 4n with n non-
negative integer can appear in the lattice discretization of a scalar eld.
this will play a major role in the following.

 null vectors

some of the secondary elds disappear from the spectrum due to the
null vector conditions. this happens in particular for one of the two
states at level 2 in the  and  families and for the unique state at
level 1 in the identity family. from each null state one can generate,
by applying the virasoro operators a whole family of null states hence
at level 2 in the identity family there is only one surviving secondary
eld, which can be identied with the stress energy tensor.

 secondary elds generated by l1

among all the secondary elds a particular role is played by those gen-
erated by the l1 virasoro generator. l1 is the generator of trans-
lations on the lattice and as a consequence it has zero eigenvalue on
translational invariant observables. another way to state this results is
to notice that l1 can be represented as a total derivative, and as such
it gives zero if applied to an operator which can be obtained as the in-
tegral over the whole lattice of a suitable density (i.e. a translationally
invariant operator).

3.2 rg analysis for h 6= 0

we shall discuss the higher order corrections to the rg analysis of sect. 2.2
along the lines of [25], to which we refer for a more detailed discussion. the
only improvement that we make with respect to [25] is in the part devoted
to the contribution due to the irrelevant operators, in which we shall make
use of the results discussed in the previous section.

we expect three types of corrections to the asymptotic results reported

in sect. 2.2:

a] analytic corrections.

they are due to the fact, already mentioned in sect. 2.2, that the actual
scaling variables in the rg approach are not hl and t but uh and ut

21

which are in principle the most general analytic functions of hl and
t which respect the z2 parity of hl and t. let us write the taylor
expansion for uh and ut, keeping only those rst few orders that are
needed for our analysis (we use the notations of [25]).

uh = hl [1 + cht + dht2 + ehh2

l + o(t3, th2

l )]

(67)

ut = t + bth2

l + ctt2 + dtt3 + etth2

l + fth4

l + o(t4, t2h2

l ) (68)

the corrections induced by the higher terms in uh and ut are of three
types.

 the rst one is very simple to understand. it is due to the higher
powers of hl contained in uh which lead to corrections to the power
behaviours listed in sect. 2.2.1 which are shifted by even integer
powers of hl. for instance in the free energy, as a consequence of
the ehh2

l term in uh, we expect a correction of this type:

fs(hl) = al

f|hl|

16

15 (1 + al

f,3|hl|2 + ....)

.

(69)

f,3 = 16

with al
15eh. the indices f, 3 in af,3 only denote the fact
(that we shall discuss in detail in the next section) that this term
is the third term in the hl expansion of the scaling function of the
singular part of the free energy.

 the second type of correction is due to the terms that depend on
hl which appear in ut. their peculiar feature is that, even if they
are originated by analytic terms in the scaling variables, they lead
in general to non analytic contributions in the scaling functions
for instance, as a consequence of the bth2
l term in ut, we nd in
the free energy a correction of the type:

16

15 (1 + al

f,2|hl|2 yt
= 22
15.

yh + ....)

.

(70)

with af,2 = (0)

f|hl|

fs(hl) = al
(0) bt and 2  yt

yh

 the corrections of the third type only appear when studying the
internal energy. they are due to the terms linear in t which are
present in uh and ut. the most important of these contributions

22

is the one due to the cht term in uh which gives a correction pro-
to the dominant scaling behaviour of the internal
portional to h
15
l
energy. we shall discuss these terms in sect. 3.4.3 below.

8

b] corrections due to irrelevant operators in the lattice hamilto-

nian.

these can be treated within the framework of the rg as follows. let
us study as an example the case of an irrelevant operator belonging to
the identity family. let us call the corresponding scaling variable u3
and its rg eigenvalue y3 (since u3 is irrelevant, y3 < 0). in this case
the dependence of u3 on t and hl is 4

u3 = u0

3 + at + bh2

l +   

.

(71)

let us for the moment neglect higher order terms and assume u3 = u0
3.
then looking again at the singular part of the free energy we nd

fs(t, hl) = |hl/h0|d/yh(

t

|hl|yt/yh

, u0

3|hl||y3|/yh)

.

(72)

3|hl||y3|/yh is small as hl  0 it is reasonable to assume that we
since u0
3|hl||y3|/yh (notice that in eq. (72) fs
can expand fs in a taylor series of u0
is not singular since it is evaluated at |hl| > 0). hence we nd (setting
again t = 0)
(73)

fs = |hl|d/yh(a1 + a2u0
3 are non-universal constants.

3|hl||y3|/yh +   )

where a1, a2, u0
this analysis can be repeated without changes for any new irrelevant
operator: u4, y4 and so on. as a last remark, notice that on top of these
non analytic corrections we also expect analytic contributions due to
the higher order terms contained in eq. (71).

while in general this analysis is only of limited interest since the yi of
the irrelevant operators are usually unknown, in the present case we
may identify the irrelevant operators with the secondary elds discussed
in 3.1 and use the corresponding rg-exponents as input of our analysis.

4in general for the irrelevant operators there is no need to tune u0

the critical point. however we shall see below that, for symmetry reasons, u0
the irrelevant operators belonging to the [] and [] families.

3 to 0 to approach
3 = 0 for all

23

c] logarithmic corrections.

h

as it is well known, the specic heat of the 2d ising model at hl = 0 ap-
proaches the critical point with a logarithmic singularity. this means
that in the free energy there must be a term of the type 0u2
t log(ut).
while in general we could expect 0 to be a generic function of the ratio
ut/u8/15
, the absence of leading log corrections in m and  strongly con-
straints this function which is usually assumed to be a simple constant.
notwithstanding this, the presence of terms that depend on hl in ut
implies that log type contributions may appear also in the case t = 0,
6= 0 in which we are interested. these can be easily obtained by
hl
inserting eq.(68) into 0u2
t log(ut) and then making the suitable deriva-
tives and limits [25]. in the case of the free energy one obtains a term
proportional to h4
l log(hl) which is too high to be observed in our ts.
however for the internal energy the rst contribution is proportional
to a smaller power of hl: h2
l log(hl) and must be taken into account in
the scaling function.

3.3 the eective lattice hamiltonian

let us call hcf t the hamiltonian which describes the continuum theory at
the critical point. the perturbed hamiltonian 5 in the continuum is given
by:

h = hcf t + h .

(74)

the aim of this section is to construct the lattice analogous (which we shall
call hlat) of h.

notice that hlat is dierent from the microscopic hamiltonian which ap-
pears in the exponent of eq. (4). eq. (4) describes the model at the level of
the lattice spacing. we are instead interested in the large distance eective
hamiltonian which one obtains when the short range degrees of freedom are
integrated out, i.e. after a large enough number of iterations of the renormal-
ization group transformation has been performed. hlat will contain all the
irrelevant operators which are compatible with the symmetries of the lattice
model. in this section we shall rst discuss the relation between the lattice

5here we follow the convention usually adopted in conformal eld theory. in the stan-
dard notation of classical statistical mechanics one would denote this quantity hamilto-
nian density rather than hamiltonian.

24

and the continuum operators, then we shall construct the lattice hamiltonian
in the hl = 0 case and nally we shall extend our results to the hl 6= 0 case.

3.3.1 relations between lattice and continuum operators.

the lattice operators are given by the most general combination of continuum
operators compatible with the symmetries of the lattice operator multiplied
by the most general analytic functions of t and hl (with a parity which is again
constrained by the symmetry of the operators involved). in the following, to
avoid a too heavy notation, we shall neglect the t dependence6.

for the spin operator we have

l = f 

0 (hl) + hlf 

0(hl) + f 

i (hl)i + hlf 

i (hl)i + hlf i

i (hl)i,

i  n (75)

where f 

i (hl) f 

i (hl) and f i

i (hl) are even functions of hl.

for the energy operator we have

l gi

l = g

i (hl)i + h2

0(hl) + hlg

0 (hl) + hlg

i (hl)i + g

i (hl)i,

i (hl) g

i (hl) and gi

i (hl) are even functions of hl and the h2

i  n (76)
where again g
l term
in front of gi
i (hl) is due to the change of sign of the  operator under duality
transformation at hl = 0 (see the discussion at the beginning of sect. 3.3.2).
among all the possible irrelevant elds only those which respect the lattice
symmetries (i.e. those of spin 0 (mod 4)) are allowed in the sums. at this
stage also irrelevant operators containing l1 or l1 appear in the sums. it
is only when these operators are applied on translationally invariant states
(i.e. on the vacuum) that they disappear. this will happen for instance
when we shall study the mean value of the free energy.

3.3.2 construction of hlat(hl = 0)

in this case all the operators belonging to the [] family are excluded due to
the z2 symmetry. also the operators belonging to the [] family are excluded
for a more subtle reason. the ising model (both on the lattice and in the
continuum) is invariant under duality transformations while the operators

6the t dependence in the scaling variables of the irrelevant operators plays a role only
in the construction of the scaling function for the internal energy and we shall resume it
in sect. 3.4.3 below.

25

belonging to the [] family change sign under duality, thus they also cannot
appear in hlat(hl = 0). thus we expect

hlat = hcf t + u0

i i,

i  [i]

,

(77)

where the u0

i are constants. there are however further restrictions:

 hlat is a scalar density, hence only operators  with angular momentum

j = 4k, k = 0, 1, 2    are allowed.

 the operator which acts on the hilbert space of the theory is the space
integral of the hamiltonian (density) hlat. as such it is translational
invariant and only operators  which do not contain the generators l1
or l1 survive the integration of eq. (77) over the space.

let us list in order of increasing conformal weight the rst few operators
which fulll all the constraints:

0 = i,

1 = l2 l2i,

2 = (l2)2i,

3 = ( l2)2i,

4 = l4i,

5 = l4i,

6 = l3 l3i

...

.

(78)

(79)

some of these elds have a natural interpretation. 0 gives rise to the bulk
contribution in the free energy (see the discussion of sect. 2.1.2). 1, 2, 3
are related to the energy momentum tensor: t t , t 2, t 2 respectively. all
the elds listed above except the identity and 6 have the same conformal
weight h = 4. the corresponding rg eigenvalue is y = 2. the eld 6
has conformal weight h6 = 6 and rg eigenvalue y6 = 4.

3.3.3 extension to hl 6= 0
mimicking the continuum case we have, also on the lattice,

hlat(hl) = hlat(hl = 0) + hll

.

inserting the expression of l of eq. (75) we nd

hlat(hl) = hcf t + ui(hl) i

(80)

(81)

where this time there is no more restriction coming from the z2 symmetry
and duality, hence i denotes here the most general operator of the spectrum

26

with spin j = 4k, k = 0, 1, .. the ui(hl) are even or odd functions of hl,
depending on the parity of i but in the even sector only for the operators
belonging to the identity family limhl0 ui(hl) 6= 0 (according to eq. (71) we
have ui(hl = 0) = u0
i ). for the operators belonging to the energy family the
rst nonzero contribution in the ui(hl) functions is of order h2
l .

let us list, starting from those with the lowest conformal weight, the new
operators which were not present in hlat(hl = 0). for future convenience
let us separate those which do not contain l1, l1 generators from the
remaining ones.
a] operators which are not generated by l1, l1.

 operators belonging to []

in the [] family the lowest ones are l4, l4 and l3 l3. in
fact l1 disappears for translational invariance and due to the
null vector equation the l2 operator which appears at level 2
can always be rewritten as l2
1 with suitable coecients. the
conformal weights of l4 and l4 are h,4 = 4 + 1
8. the corre-
sponding rg eigenvalue is y,4 = 2  1
8 . the conformal weight
of l3 l3 is h,33 = 6 + 1
8. the corresponding rg eigenvalue is
y,33 = 4  1
8 .

 operators belonging to []

l  which is responsible for the h2

the most important contribution from the [] family is the one
proportional to h2
l term which
appears in ut as we discussed in the previous section. besides
this one, the lowest operators which appear in the [] family must
be of the type l4 or l4. in fact the same mechanism which
allowed us to eliminate the secondary elds of level 2 in the []
family also works for the [] family. on top of this in the [] family
a new null vector appears at level 3, thus allowing us to eliminate
also all the elds at this level. keeping also into account the fact
that the corresponding ui(hl) functions must start from h2
l we
immediately see that all these operators have too high powers of
hl to contribute to the scaling function and can be neglected.

b] operators which contain l1, l1 generators.

the lowest operators are, in order of increasing weight:

27

 l1 l1, whose conformal weight is h,11 = 2 + 1
sponding rg eigenvalue is y,11 =  1
8.
l2
1, whose conformal weight is h,22 = 4 + 1
 l2
1
sponding rg eigenvalue is y,22 = 2  1
8.
 l1 l1, whose conformal weight is h,11 = 3. the corresponding
rg eigenvalue is y,11 = 1.

3.4 scaling functions

using the results of the previous section we are now in the position to write
the expression for the scaling functions keeping all the corrections up to the
order h3
l .

3.4.1 the free energy

due to translational invariance, only the secondary elds which are not gen-
erated by l1, l1 contribute to the free energy. we nd, for the singular
part of the lattice free energy:

fs(hl) = al

to these terms we must then add the bulk contributions

.

(83)

we have already noticed in sect. 2.1.2 that fb can be obtained from the
exact solution of the ising model on the lattice at the critical point. also the
next term: fb,1 can be evaluated (with a precision of ten digits) by noticing
that it corresponds to the constant contribution to the susceptibility at the
critical point. this term has been evaluated in [26]. we neglect for the
moment this information and keep the fb,1 amplitude in the scaling function
as a free parameter. it is the rst subleading term in the scaling function and
as such it can be rather precisely estimated with the tting procedure that
we shall discuss below. we shall compare our estimates with the expected

deriving this expression with respect to hl we obtain the scaling functions

for the magnetization and the susceptibility7.

7in this way we obtain directly the lattice denitions of these two quantities, since we
are deriving the lattice free energy with respect to the lattice magnetic eld. there is no
need to go through the continuum denition of the magnetization.

3.4.2 mass spectrum

the simplest way to deal with the mass spectrum is to t the square of
the masses. the scaling function turns out to be very similar to that which
describes the singular part of the free energy eq. (82). the only additional
terms are due to the secondary elds which contain l1 l1. it turns out
that the corresponding scaling dimension exactly match those which already
appear in eq. (82). in fact

 hll1 l1 gives a contribution which scales with |hl|

however we shall see below that the presence of these new elds and in

particular of l1 l1 has very important consequences.

3.4.3 internal energy

we may obtain the internal energy as a derivative with respect to t of the
singular part of the free energy. however in doing this we must resume (as
discussed above) the t dependence in the scaling variables. this leads to some
new terms in the scaling function with powers 8
15 (due to the cht term in uh),
24
15 and 40
15 (due to the t terms in scaling variables of the irrelevant operators).
it is nice to see that the presence of these additional contributions can be
understood in another, equivalent, way. looking at eq. (16) or (76) we see
that the internal energy on the lattice contains a term of type hl. the
powers listed above are exactly those that we obtain keeping into account

30

the additional hl term in the scaling function. keeping also into account
the bulk contribution we end up with the following scaling function. we
have:

where al
l term in the bulk part of the
internal energy, al
l log|hl| term discussed
in sect.3.1 and the bulk constant term has been already taken into account
in the denition of e(h). the rst correction which appears in the internal
energy (with amplitude al
e,1) is the one with the lowest power of hl among
all the subleading terms of the various scaling functions this. its eect on
the scaling behaviour of the internal energy is very important and it is easily
observable also in standard monte carlo simulations [13].

3.4.4 overlaps

also in this case we tted the square of the overlap constants. the scaling
functions can be obtained with a straightforward application of the argu-
ments discussed above. also elds generated by hl1 l1 must be taken into
account. moreover, for the overlaps with the internal energy also the h
term must be taken into account. we end up with the following result for
the magnetic overlaps.

4 the transfer matrix method

we computed the mass spectrum and observables by numerical diagonaliza-
tion of the transfer matrix. the transfer matrix was introduced by kramers
and wannier [27] in 1941. for a discussion of the transfer matrix see e.g.
refs. [28, 29]. the starting point is a simple transformation of the boltzmann
factor

exp

 x<n,m>

nm + hlxn

n
 = t (u1, u2) t (u2, u3) ... t (ul0, u1)

(89)

where un0 = ((n0,1), (n0,2), ... (n0,l1)) is the spin conguration on the time
slice n0. t is given by

t (un0, un0+1) = v (un0)1/2 u(un0, un0+1) v (un0+1)1/2

(90)

with

and

u(un0, un0+1) = exp

xn1=1

v (un0) = exp

the partition function becomes

(93)

where t is interpreted as a matrix. the time-slice congurations are the
indices of the matrix. the number of congurations on a time slice is 2l1.
therefore the transfer matrix is a 2l1  2l1 matrix. by construction the
transfer matrix is positive and symmetric. the i are the eigenvalues of the
transfer matrix.

4.1 computing observables

observables that are dened on a single time slice can be easily expressed in
the transfer matrix formalism. let us discuss as examples the magnetisation

32

and the internal energy.

where s is a diagonal matrix. the values on the diagonal are given by 1,1
on the congurations. (s(u, u) = (u, u) u(1) where u(1) denotes  on the
rst site of the time slice). the |i > are normalized eigenvectors of t .

in the limit l0   the expression simplies to

< 1,1 >=< 0|s|0 >

(95)

where |0 > is the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue.
corresponding to the energy is given by

the energy can be computed in a similar way. the diagonal matrix

e(u, u) = (u, u) u(1)u(2)

.

(96)

note that we can only express the product of nearest neighbour spins in this
simple form if both spins belong to the same time slice.

in order to understand the relation of the mass spectrum with the eigen-
value spectrum of the transfer matrix we have to compute correlation func-
tions with separation in time direction. the time-slice correlation function
eq. (22) becomes in the limit l0

.

(99)

an analogous result can be obtained for the energy.

33

4.2 computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of t

the remaining problem is to compute (numerically) eigenvectors and eigen-
values of the transfer matrix. since we are interested in the thermodynamic
limit as well as in the continuum limit we would like to use as large values of
l1 as possible. this soon becomes a very dicult task since the dimension
of the transfer matrix increases exponentially with l1. the problem slightly
simplies if one is interested in the computation of the the leading eigenval-
ues and eigenvectors only, and in these last years various methods have been
developed to address this task (for a comprehensive discussion of existing
approaches see e.g. ref. [29] or the appendix of ref. [30]). in particular there
are two approaches which have shown to be the most eective ones.

 the rst one reduces the numerical complexity of the problem by writ-
ing the transfer matrix as a product of sparse matrices. see refs.
[29, 30].

 the second one is to reduce the dimension of the transfer matrix by

restricting it to denite channels.

since we are only interested in the zero-momentum states of the system we
decided to follow the second approach and to compute the zero-momentum
reduced transfer matrix. the zero-momentum reduced transfer matrix acts
on the space of equivalence classes of congurations on slices that transform
into each other by translations.

the matrix elements of the reduced transfer-matrix are given by

t (u, v) = (n(u) n(v))1/2 xuuxvv

t (u, v) = (n(u)/n(v))1/2xvv

t (u, v) .

(100)
where n(u) is the number of congurations in u. for example for l0 = 20
the dimension of the transfer matrix is reduced from 1048576 to 52488.

still the matrix is too large to save all elements of the matrix in the mem-
ory of the computer. therefore we applied an iterative solver and computed
the elements of t whenever they were needed.

as solver we used a generalized power method as discussed in the ap-

pendix of ref. [30].

34

the lattice sizes that we could reach in this way were large enough for
our purpose, thus we made no further eort to improve our method and it is
well possible that our algorithm might still not be the optimal one.

we propose here, as a suggestion to the interested reader, some directions

in which it could be improved.

 one could try to mix the two strategies mentioned above and try to
factorize the reduced transfer matrix as a product of sparse matrices.
however note that the complexity of the problem increases exponen-
tially with the lattice size. therefore even a big improvement in the
method would allow just to go up in the maximal l1 by a few sites.

 one could study the transfer matrix along the diagonals of the square
lattice. since the distance between two points on the diagonal is 2,
naively one could increase the accessible lattice size by a factor of 2.

5 thermodynamic limit

in order to take the thermodynamic limit we must know the nite size scaling
behaviour of the various observables as a function of l1. this is a very inter-
esting subject in itself and several exact results have been obtained in this
context starting from the exact s-matrix solution and using thermodynamic
bethe ansatz (tba) techniques [16, 31].

for instance, it is possible to construct a large l asymptotic expansion for
the nite size scaling (fss) of the energy levels based only on the knowledge
of the exact s-matrix of the theory [32, 33]. let us look to this fss behaviour
in more detail.

let us dene ma(l) as the deviation of the mass ma of the particle a

from its asymptotic value:

ma(l)  ma(l)  ma()

.

(101)

then in the large l limit, the shift (normalized to the lowest mass m1) is
dominated by an exponential decrease of the type

ma(l)

m1  

1

8m2
a

2
abc
abc



xb,c

exp (abcl)

(102)

35

b  m2

c| < m2

where the constants abc and abc can be obtained from the s-matrix and
the prime in the sum of eq. (102) means that the sum must be done only on
those combinations of indices that fulll the condition: |m2
a. in
particular the abc turn out to be of order one, so that the fss corrections are
dominated (as one could naively expect) by a decreasing exponential of the
type exp(l1/) where the correlation length  is the inverse of the lowest
mass of the theory.
in principle we could use our data to test also the tba predictions for the
fss. however we preferred to follow a dierent approach. we chose values of
h large enough so as to fulll the condition l1/ >> 1 for the largest values
of l1 that we could reach. in this way we could essentially neglect all the
details of the fss functions and approximate them with a single exponential
(or, in some cases, with a pair of exponentials). in order to study the fss
functions one should choose smaller values of h. we plan to address this
issue in a forthcoming paper. with our choice of h we drastically simplify
the fss problem, however nothing is obtained for free. the price we have to
pay following this route is that we need to know several terms in the scaling
functions to t such large values of h. this explains the major eort that we
devoted to this issue in sect. 3.

5.1 numerical extrapolation

according to the above discussion, for the extrapolation of our data to the
thermodynamic limit we made no use of the quantitative theoretical results.
we made only use of the qualitative result that the corrections due to the
nite l1 vanish exponentially.

we used as ansatz for the extrapolation either

a(l1) = a() + c1 exp(l1/z1)

or

a(l1) = a() + c1 exp(l1/z1) + c2 exp(l1/z2)

where a represents any of the quantities that we have studied.

(103)

(104)

in order to compute the free parameters a(), c1 and z1 or a(), c1, z1,
c2 and z2 we solved numerically the system of equations that results from the
lattice sizes l1,max, l1,max 1 and l1,max 2 or l1,max, l1,max 1, l1,max 2,
l1,max  3 and l1,max  4.

36

the error of a() was estimated by comparing results where l1,max is
the largest lattice size that is available and from l1,max = l1,max  1. mostly
ansatz (104) was used to obtain the nal result. in some cases however the
numerical accuracy was not sucient to resolve the second exponential term.
then the nal result was taken from the ansatz (103).

the free energy for this lattice size is given. in the third column we present
the extrapolation with a single exponential and in the fourth column the
extrapolation with a double exponential ansatz.

in tab. 6 we give, as example, the extrapolation to the thermodynamic
limit of the free energy at hl = 0.075. as input for the extrapolation we used
the free energy computed up to 12 digits. we consider all these digits save
of rounding errors. within the given precision the free energy has not yet
converged at l1 = 21. the single exponential extrapolation (103) converges

37

(within the given precision) at l1 = 18. for larger lattices the result uctu-
ates in the last digit due to rounding errors of the input data. the double
exponential extrapolation (103) converges at l1 = 16. as nal result for the
thermodynamic limit we quote f (0.075) = 0.99208015671.

6 analysis of the results

the major problem in extracting the continuum limit results from the data
listed in tabs. 10-13 is to estimate the systematic errors involved in the trun-
cation of the scaling functions that we use in the ts. we shall devote the
rst part of this section to a detailed description of the procedure that we
followed to estimate this uncertainty. we shall give upper and lower bounds
for the critical amplitudes which turn out to be very near to each other and
allow for high precision predictions (in some cases we can x 5 or even 6 sig-
nicative digits). we then compare our predictions with the results obtained
in the framework of the s-matrix approach. in all cases we nd a perfect
agreement within our bounds. finally in sect. 6.3, we give, assuming as xed
input the s-matrix predictions for the critical amplitudes, our best estimates
for the amplitudes of some of the subleading terms involved in the ts.

6.1 systematic errors

in order to estimate the systematic errors involved in our estimates of the
critical amplitudes we performed for each observable several independent
ts starting with a tting function containing only the dominant scaling
dimension and then adding the subleading elds one by one. for each tting
function we tried rst to t all the exiting data (those listed in tabs. 10-13)
and then eliminated the data one by one starting from the farthest from the
critical point (i.e.
from those with the highest values of hl). among the
(very large) set of estimates of the critical amplitudes we selected only those
fullling the following requirements:

1]

the reduced 2 of the t must be of order unity 8. in order to x
precisely a threshold we required the t to have a condence level larger

8this is a slightly incorrect use of the 2 function since the input data are aected by
errors which are of systematic more than statistic nature. notice however that we do not
use it to determine best t values for the observables that we t (we shall only give upper

38

than 30%.

2]

3]

the number of degrees of freedom of the t (i.e. the number of data
tted minus the number of free parameters in the tting function) must
be larger than 3.

for all the subleading elds included in the tting function, the am-
plitude estimated from the t must be larger than the corresponding
errors, otherwise the eld is eliminated from the t.

4] the amplitudes of the subleading elds (in units of the critical ampli-
tude) must be such that when multiplied for the corresponding power
of hl, (for the largest value of hl involved in the t) must give a contri-
bution much smaller than 1 (in order to x a threshold we required it
to be strictly smaller than 0.3).

in general only a small number of combinations of data and degrees of free-
dom fullls simultaneously all these requirements. among all the correspond-
ing estimates of the critical amplitude we then select the smallest and the
largest ones as lower and upper bounds9.

6.2 critical amplitudes

in tab. 7 we report as an example the ts to the magnetization (with the
scaling function obtained by deriving eq. (84)) fullling the above require-
ments. for each value of nf we only report the ts with the minimum and
maximum allowed number of d.o.f., since the best t result for al
m changes
monotonically as the data are eliminated from the t. this is a general pat-
tern for all the observables that we studied and greatly simplies the analysis
of the data. looking at the table one can see that at least four parameters
are needed in the t to have a reasonable condence level, due to the very
small error of the data that we use. in the last line we report the only t in
which all the 25 data reported in tab. 10 have been used. it required taking
into account the rst eight terms of the scaling function. for nf > 8, even

and lower bounds for them) but only as a tool to eliminate those situations in which the
tting functions are clearly unable to describe the input data.

9in making this choice we also keep into account the errors in the estimates induced

by the systematic errors of the input data.

39

if we use all the data at our disposal we cannot full requirement 3. it is
interesting to notice that the ts which give the best approximations to the
exact value of al
m are those in which we use the largest possible number of
terms of the scaling function. this is a general pattern for all the observables
that we studied. all the ts were performed using the double precision nag
routine go2daf. the bounds that we obtained are listed in tab. 8 together
with the s-matrix predictions. from these results we immediately obtain the
upper and lower bounds for the universal amplitude ratios of tab. 2. they
are reported in the last two lines of tab. 8.

6.3 subleading operators

in principle we could try to estimate in the ts discussed above also the
amplitudes of the rst two or three subleading terms in the scaling functions,
however it is clear that the results that we would obtain would be strongly
cross correlated and we would not be able to give reliable estimates for the

corresponding errors (except, at most, for the rst one of them, the next to
leading term in the scaling function).

in order to obtain some information on the subleading terms we decided
to follow another route. the results of the previous section strongly support
the correctness of the s-matrix predictions. we decided then to assume
these predictions as an input of our analysis, xing their values in the scaling
functions. then we used the same procedure discussed in sect. 6.1 to identify
the amplitude of the rst subleading eld. let us look to the various scaling
functions in more detail

6.3.1

free energy

this is the case for which we have the most precise data. moreover we may
use the data for the magnetization and the susceptibility as a cross check of
our estimates.

combining all the data at our disposal we end up with a rather precise

estimate for al

f,b, which turns out to be bounded by:

41

 0.055 < al

f,b <  0.050 .

(105)

as mentioned in sect. 3.4.1 it is possible to evaluate this amplitude in a
completely dierent way, by looking at the constant term in the magnetic
susceptibility of the model at the critical point. the comparison between
our estimate and the expected value represents a test of the reliability of our
tting procedure. the expected value of this amplitude [26] is (in our units)

al
f,b =  0.0524442...

(106)

which is indeed in perfect agreement with our estimates.

we can then use the value of eq. (106) as a xed input and try to estimate
the amplitude of the following subleading eld which has a very important
physical meaning being the contribution due to the presence of the t t (and
related terms) operator in the lattice hamiltonian. remarkably enough, it
turns out, by applying the usual analysis, that the corresponding amplitude
al
f,1 is compatible with zero. more precisely we see that, changing the number
of input data and of parameters in the scaling function, the sign of al
f,1
changes randomly and its modulus is never larger than 104. the same
pattern is reproduced in the magnetization and in the susceptibility. we
summarize these observations with the following bound

|al

f,1| < 0.00005

.

(107)

this result agrees with the observation concerning the absence of corrections
due to irrelevant operators in the case t 6= 0 and h = 0. (for a thorough
discussion of this point see [34] and refs. therein.)
f,1 = 0 then we may give a reliable estimate for

if we also assume that al

the amplitude of al

f,2 which turns out to be bounded by:

0.020 < al

f,2 < 0.022 .

(108)

this is the highest subleading term that we could study with a reasonable

degree of condence in our scaling functions.

6.3.2 internal energy

in the case of the internal energy the rst subleading amplitude can be stud-
ied with very high condence since it is associated to a very small exponent:

42

8

15 . the result turns out to be

|hl|

 0.646 < al

e,1 <  0.644 .

(109)

in this case the ts are so constrained that we can study with a rather good
degree of condence also the next subleading correction, al
e,2 which is very
interesting, since it again contains the t t term discussed above. in agree-
ment with the previous observations also in this case the amplitude turns
out to be compatible with zero. more precisely its sign changes randomly as
the input data are changed in the ts and its modulus can be bounded by:

|al

e,2| < 0.005

.

(110)

which is not as strong as the bound of eq. (107) but clearly goes in the same
direction.

6.3.3 masses

the most interesting feature of the scaling functions for the masses is that
there is no analytic term and the rst subleading contribution al
mi,1 is the
exact analogous of the al

f,1 term for the free energy.

in this case we nd a non zero contribution for al

mi,1. in particular we

nd the following bounds for the three masses that we studied:

 0.21 < al
 0.48 < al
 0.65 < al

m1,1 <  0.20
m2,1 <  0.41
m3,1 <  0.50 .

(111)

(112)

(113)

in the case of the masses a preferred direction is singled out. therefore,
one has to expect that there is a nite overlap with the irrelevant operator
that breaks the rotational symmetry. notice that a similar contribution has
been observed also in the case of the thermal perturbation of the ising model
in [35] where the authors studied the breaking of rotational invariance in the
two point correlator (see sect.iv-g of [35] for a discussion of this point).

our results on the amplitude of the subleading corrections are summa-

rized in tab. 9.

7 conclusions

the major goal of this paper was to test the s-matrix description proposed
by zamolodchikov in [2] for the 2d ising model perturbed by a magnetic eld.
to this end we developed some tools and obtained some results which are
rather interesting in themselves. in particular

 we improved the standard transfer matrix calculations by implement-
ing a zero momentum projection which allowed us to drastically reduce
the dimension of the matrix.

 we discussed in detail the relationship between continuum and lattice

observables.

 by using cft results at the critical point we constructed the rst 7-8

terms of the scaling functions for various quantities on the lattice.

we could obtain in this way very precise numerical estimates for several
critical amplitudes (in some cases with 5 or even 6 signicative digits) and
in all cases we found a perfect agreement between s-matrix predictions and
lattice results.

by assuming the s-matrix predictions as an input of our analysis we could
estimate some of the subleading amplitudes in the scaling functions. in one
case the value of the subleading amplitude was already known and again we
found a complete agreement between theoretical prediction and numerical
estimate. for the remaining ones there is up to our knowledge no theoretical

44

prediction. they are collected in tab. 8 and represent the most interesting
outcome of our analysis. we leave them as a challenge for theorists working
in the eld.

among the others, the most surprising result concerns the t t term which
turns out to have a negligible amplitude in the scaling functions of the trans-
lationally invariant observables. it would be nice to understand which is the
reason of such behaviour.

let us conclude by stressing that the techniques that we have developed
can be easily extended to the case in which a combinations of both thermal
and magnetic perturbations is present. in this case the exact integrability
is lost and our numerical methods could help to test new approaches and
suggest new ideas.
