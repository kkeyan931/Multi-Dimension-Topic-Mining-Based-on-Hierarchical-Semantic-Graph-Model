abstract

the modular transformation properties of admissible characters of the ane su-
peralgebra sl(2|1; c)k at fractional level k = 1/u  1, u  n \ {1} are presented. all
modular invariants for u = 2 and u = 3 are calculated explicitly and an a-series and
d-series of modular invariants emerge.

1 introduction

in a series of papers [1, 2, 3], the properties of the ane superalgebra sl(2|1; c)k at frac-
tional level were extensively investigated. as well as the abstract interest, the motivation
for this work was in the potential relevance to the n = 2 non-critical string. the gen-
erally held notion that a non-critical (super)string is described in terms of a topological
g/g wess-zumino-novikov-witten model, with g a lie (super)group [4, 5, 6], provides
the link:
in order to describe the spectrum in the g = sl(2|1; r) case, believed to be
that related to the n = 2 string, a good understanding of sl(2|1; c)k at fractional level is
required. indeed, when the matter, which is coupled to supergravity in the n = 2 non-
critical string, is minimal, i.e. taken in an n = 2 super coulomb gas representation with
central charge

cmatter = 3(cid:18)1 

2p

u(cid:19) ,

p, u  n,

gcd(p, u) = 1,

(1.1)

it can be shown that the level of the matter ane superalgebra sl(2|1; c)k appearing in
the sl(2|1; r)/sl(2|1; r) model is of the form

k =

p
u

 1.

(1.2)

it is precisely these values of the level for which admissible representations of sl(2|1; c)k
do exist [7].

the present work builds immediately on that of [3], inheriting this motivation, but
also with pretensions to more general relevance in that we construct modular invariant
combinations of sl(2|1; c)k characters, which could be taken as starting points in the
building of partition functions for rational conformal eld theories.

we begin in section 2 by presenting the branching functions of so-called class iv and
class v sl(2|1; c)k characters1, where the level k = 1/u  1, u  n \ {1}. these branching
functions provide expressions for sl(2|1; c)k characters in terms of functions with known
modular transformation properties, facilitating the analysis of their behaviour under mod-
ular transformations.

the branching functions were rst calculated (actually conjectured, based upon analysis
for low values of u) in [3] for neveu-schwarz characters (corresponding to the twisted
version of sl(2|1; c)k). this was a natural starting point since the challenge here lies
in computing the eect of the modular s transformation    1
 , under which neveu-
schwarz characters transform into a linear combination of neveu-schwarz characters at the

1class i characters are modular forms rather than functions and it is not clear if they can be used to
construct modular invariants. class ii and class iii representations are believed to contain subsingular
vectors, making the computation of their characters extremely dicult; by contrast, classes iv and v
are believed to contain no subsingular vectors, making the calculation of their characters tractable. they
are also modular functions, justifying their role as the central objects of study. incidentally, those which
are singular in the limit   0 are related to n = 2 superconformal characters. see [1], [2] and [3] for
denitions and detailed exposition.

same level. however, we will go on to consider the question of forming modular invariant
combinations of characters: as the modular t transformation    + 1 takes neveu-
schwarz characters to supercharacters, which under s transform into ramond characters
(corresponding to the untwisted version of sl(2|1; c)k), we will require knowledge of the
modular transformation properties of these characters as well. to this end, we calculate
neveu-schwarz supercharacter and ramond character branching functions, simply derived
by spectral ow. under t , ramond characters do give back a combination of ramond
characters so consideration of this set is enough to allow us to form modular invariants;
however, for completeness we also consider ramond supercharacters, which form a closed
set under modular transformations.

having established branched expressions for the various sl(2|1; c)k characters such that
they are amenable to applying the modular s transformation, we proceed to do so in section
3. here we derive the action of the s transformation on the sl(2|1; c)k neveu-schwarz and
ramond characters and supercharacters at all levels k = 1/u  1, u  n \ {1}. we also
mention the action of the modular t transformation.

finally in section 4 we identify an a-series and d-series of modular invariants, based
on the appearance of such invariants in the two simplest cases of u = 2 and u = 3, the
details of which may be found in the appendices.

2 branching sl(2|1; c)k characters

in [3], branching formulae for the neveu-schwarz class iv and class v characters of
the ane superalgebra sl(2|1; c)k (k = 1/u  1) were conjectured. the characters were
branched into products of sl(2; c)k characters, generalised theta functions and string func-
tions, the modular transformation properties of which are known.

by denition, sl(2|1; c)k characters are given by

sl(2|1;c)k
h,h+



(, ,  ) d= tr exp{2i(j 3

0 + u0 +  l0)},

(2.1)

0 and u0 are the zero mode cartan generators of sl(2|1; c)k. we label the characters
where j 3
by the isospin and charge quantum numbers which characterise the sl(2|1; c)k highest
weight states |i of the associated representations2:

j 3
0 |i =

1
2

h|i, u0|i =

h+|i.

(2.2)

from ref. [8] we have the following expression for sl(2; c)k characters:

sl(2;c)k
n,n



(,  ) =

v+,w(cid:0) 

u , (cid:1)  v,w(cid:0) 
u , (cid:1)

1,2(,  )  1,2(,  )

,

(2.3)

2see [1, 2] for more details. it is conditions on these quantum numbers that split the representations

into the classes mentioned earlier.

where the level is parametrised as

k =

t
u

,

gcd(t, u) = 1,

u  n,

t  z,

with 0 6 n 6 2u + t  2 and 0 6 n 6 u  1 and

v

d= u((n + 1)  n(k + 2)),

w d= u2(k + 2).

in the above, the generalised theta functions m,m [9] are dened as

m,m(,  ) d=xnz

qm(n+ m

2m )2

zm(n+ m

2m ).

the variables q and z are dened by

q d= exp(2i ),
z d= exp(2i).

(2.13)

we now state the formulae for the branching of sl(2|1; c)k neveu-schwarz characters

as conjectured in [3]. the result for class iv characters reads

as we will come to consider the characters and supercharacters of the ramond sector
and the supercharacters of the neveu-schwarz sector, we mention that the neveu-schwarz
supercharacters have the same quantum numbers as the characters while the ramond
characters and supercharacters have

to obtain the neveu-schwarz supercharacters, we must shift the variable    + 1
 (this procedure corresponding to an

in (2.14) and (2.15), then divide the results by eihn s
insertion of the operator (1)f in the denition of the character). for class iv we nd

on applying the modular s transformation to a particular character, we obtain a lin-
ear combination of class iv and class v characters. the calculation of the eect of s in

6

the general case is thus simplied by combining the branched sl(2|1; c)k formulae. (we
also recall here that s applied to neveu-schwarz characters gives a linear combination of
neveu-schwarz characters, whereas s applied to ramond characters gives neveu-schwarz
supercharacters and vice versa; ramond supercharacters transform into themselves.) ex-
amining the neveu-schwarz branching formulae (2.14) and (2.15), we see that the substi-
tution m = m  m  1, m  = u  1  m in the class v formula (2.15) gives us precisely the
class iv formula (2.14). since 0 6 m +m  6 u2, these new values of m = u2m m 
and m = u  1  m  are those for which 0 6 m < m 6 u  1, whereas for class iv we
have 0 6 m 6 m 6 u  1. we can use the same branching formula (2.14) for both class
iv and class v , with 0 6 m 6 u  1 and 0 6 m 6 u  1, but we must still use the relevant
m and m  and expressions for the class v quantum numbers to obtain the correct values
of hn s

 and hn s
+ .
the story for the ramond characters (2.25) and (2.26) is exactly the same; for the
neveu-schwarz and ramond supercharacters we must modify (2.27) and (2.29) slightly.
the nal versions of the branching formulae read (now labelling the sl(2|1; c)k characters

at rst sight the problem of extracting from this expression a linear combination of
neveu-schwarz characters (2.31) would appear a fairly challenging task. in fact we do not
need to proceed in this way. looking at (2.31), we see that taking only the a = b = 0 term
(say) provides us with a unique linear signature term for each neveu-schwarz character,
the coecient of which is necessarily the coecient of that particular character. this
signature takes the following form:

n s, sl(2|1;c)k

n,n

(, ,  )  

sl(2;c)k

the problem of computing the coecients of sl(2|1; c)k neveu-schwarz characters in (3.1)
is thus reduced to a simple matter of extracting the correct coecients for the signatures
(3.2). hence

however, this expression simplies considerably. the sum over b can trivially be per-
formed to give a factor u  1. the sum over a can also straightforwardly be found to give
a factor u + 1. hence the matrix entries sn s

we note that sn s and ssr are symmetric; that sr = (ssn s)t; that all of these matrices
are unitary; and that the matrices as calculated by brute force for u = 2 (as found in
[2]) and u = 3 (also calculated in [12] for the neveu-schwarz characters) given in the
appendices agree with the above results.

in order to consider modular invariant combinations of sl(2|1; c)k characters, we must
also know how they transform under the modular t transformation t : (, ,  )  (, ,  +

m,m

4 modular invariants

with the behaviour of sl(2|1; c)k characters under the modular s and t transformations
now established, we proceed by looking for modular invariant combinations of characters.
these could be taken as starting points in the building of partition functions for rational
conformal eld theories. the canonical example of this is of course the classication of
su(2) modular invariants, implying the classication of the minimal models, by cappelli,
itzykson and zuber [13] (see also [14]). it was found that these partition functions fell into
an a-d-e pattern. although we do not attempt to obtain a full classication of (fractional
level) sl(2|1; c)k modular invariants here, we do nd two series of invariants, analogous to
the a- and d-series obtained in the su(2) case. the a-series is that of the diagonal modular
invariants and so is trivially obtained; the d-series is related to this by a permutation.

modular invariant combinations of characters take the form

z =

u1xm,m,n,n=0

n r

mm,nnr

m,mr

n,n + n n s

mm,nnn s

m,mn s

n,n

+ n sn s

mm,nnsn s

m,msn s

n,n +

u1xa,a,b,b=0

n sr

aa,bbsr

a,asr

b,b,

(4.1)

written in this way to emphasise the fact that the ramond supercharacters form a closed set
under modular transformations, whereas the remaining sectors mix as detailed previously.
for physical modular invariants, the nmm,nn must be non-negative integers. in addition,
the vacuum should be non-degenerate so n r
00,00 must be equal to 1 (the vacuum character
in this context is r

0,0).

clearly, the identity matrix iu2 will always satisfy the above requirements (since the s
and t transformation matrices are unitary); these are the a-series modular invariants. we
can ask if there are any other general invariants: we have examined the cases u = 2 and

11

u = 3 exhaustively (see appendices) and in these cases the only other invariants containing
r

0,0 are

for u = 2 and

1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 1



n r = n n s =


1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0

0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0



n r = n n s =

(4.2)

(4.3)

for u = 3. the ordering of terms in these matrices is as given in the tables a.1, a.2, b.1 and
b.2. (note that as t interpolates between neveu-schwarz characters and supercharacters,
n n s = n sn s.)

the above modular invariants are simple currents of the form

where

x m,m(m,m),

(m, m) = (m, (m  m) mod u).

(4.4)

(4.5)

alternatively, labelling the characters by (h, h+) this is equivalent (see earlier denitions)
to (h, h+) = (h, h+). we also see this pattern appearing in the ramond superchar-
acters. the question now arises as to whether such a permutation invariant can be found
at other levels: in fact it is fairly easy to check that such an invariant exists at all levels
k = 1/u  1. the matrix n is

if n = m, n = (m  m) mod u
otherwise.

(4.6)

so for example in the case of the neveu-schwarz s transformation, we nd

0

(n)mm,nn =(1
(nsn s)mm,nn =xa,a

nmm,aasn s

aa,nn

m((mm) mod u),nn

= sn s
= (1)m+nei(u+1)(um1)(un1)/u

 ei(u1)(m2((mm ) mod u)+u)(n2n+u)/u

(4.7)

12

and

(sn sn)mm,nn = sn s

mm,n((nn) mod u)

= (1)m+nei(u+1)(um1)(un1)/u

 ei(u1)(m2m +u)(n2((nn) mod u)+u)/u.

(4.8)

considering each possible combination of m > m or m < m and n > n or n < n it is a
simple matter to verify that the phases in (4.7) and (4.8) are equal and so that sn s and
n commute. a similar analysis applies to the other components of the s transformation;
the matrices t as dened by (3.16) also straightforwardly commute with n. we have thus
identied a d-series of modular invariants.

it should perhaps be noted that the generic approach for producing such invariants,
based on examining the outer automorphisms of the relevant ane dynkin diagram [15],
is not straightforward to implement here: since we are dealing with a superalgebra, the
dynkin diagram is not unique and notions such as fundamental weights are ill-dened.
however, the emergence of simple current invariants would seem to indicate that the generic
approach could be extended to deal with this situation.

5 conclusion

we have found expressions for the modular s transformation of sl(2|1; c)k characters at
fractional level k = 1/u  1. this has allowed us to calculate all modular invariants for
the cases u = 2 and u = 3, leading to the discovery of an a-series and d-series of modular
invariants. the derivation of the general s transformation of sl(2|1; c)k characters neatly
rounds o the work of [3] and enables us to look at modular invariants in this framework
of ane superalgebras at fractional level, a subject little studied.
it would of course
be interesting to have a complete classication of these invariants, generally a non-trivial
problem; however, it would not be unlikely that an a-d-e type classication might appear,
given the underlying presence of sl(2). we make no claims that these invariants constitute
fully-edged partition functions, given the complications entering at fractional level, where
considering fusion rules would seem to require the inclusion of elds not corresponding to
highest or lowest weight representations: this was originally discovered for fractional level
sl(2) by awata and yamada [16]. see also [17] for the case of fractional level sl(3) and
some discussion of the sl(2) case. it would be interesting to consider fusion rules in the
present context and attempt to realise a rational conformal eld theory based on fractional
level sl(2|1; c)k.

the supercharacters in each sector have the same quantum numbers as the corresponding
characters. the relation between m and m  values in class v and the m and m values
which allow us to combine classes iv and v in the branching formulae (2.31), (2.32), (2.33)
and (2.34) is m = u  2  m  m , m = u  1  m .

for all the nmm,nn to be non-negative integers, we clearly must have that a > b + c.
this allows us to nd a basic set of modular invariants, from which we can construct all
possible cases by linear combination. we make the following choices:

(i) a = 1, b = c = 0
(ii) a = b = 1, c = 0
(iii) a = c = 1, b = 0.

(a.11)

case (i) gives us the permutation invariant

n r = n n s =

1 0 0 0

0 0 1 0

0 1 0 0

0 0 0 1





;

(a.12)

case (iv) gives us the identity n r = n n s = i4. case (ii), lacking as it does the vacuum
character r

0,0, would appear to be of no physical interest.

for the ramond supercharacters we nd

n sr =

a possible set of ve linearly independent invariants arises from the choices

(i) a = 1, b = c = d = e = 0
(ii)
b = 1, a = c = d = e = 0
(iii) d = 1, a = b = c = e = 0
(iv) a = d = e = 1, b = c = 0
(v)
b = c = e = 1, a = d = 0.

(a.14)

case (iv) gives us the identity and case (v) the permutation invariant.

(b.9)

the requirement that entries be non-negative gives us the restrictions a > d and c > b.
we now have four basic modular invariants, resulting from the following choices:

(i) a = 1, b = c = d = 0
(ii)
c = 1, a = b = d = 0
(iii) a = d = 1, b = c = 0
(iv)
b = c = 1, a = d = 0.

(b.10)

case (i) gives us the diagonal invariant and case (ii) the permutation invariant; cases (iii)
and (iv) do not contain r

0,0.

where a1 = a + c + f + g, a2 = b + c  d, a3 = a  b + d, b3 = c  e + f , b4 = a + b + c  d + g,
c2 = b + c  d  e + f , c3 = a  b  c + d + e, e7 = a  b  g, h8 = c + d + e,
h9 = a + b + c  d  e + f + g. there are now seven basic invariants:

(i) a = b = 1, c = d = e = f = g = 0
(ii)
c = d = 1, a = b = e = f = g = 0
(iii)
c = e = 1, a = b = d = f = g = 0
(iv) a = g = 1, b = c = d = e = f = 0
(v)
f = 1, a = b = c = d = e = g = 0
e = f = 1, a = b = c = d = g = 0
(vi)
(vii) a = c = e = f = 1, b = d = g = 0.

(b.12)

case (vi) gives us the identity and case (v) the permutation.
