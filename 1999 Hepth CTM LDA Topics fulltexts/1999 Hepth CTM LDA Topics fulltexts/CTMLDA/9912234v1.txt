the su (2) skyrme model,expanding in the collective co-
ordinates variables, gives rise to second-class constraints. re-
cently this system was embedded in a more general abelian
gauge theory using the bfft hamiltonian method. in this
work we quantize this gauge theory computing the noether
current anomaly using for this two dierent methods: an oper-
atorial dirac rst class formalism and the non-local bv quan-
tization coupled with the fujikawa regularization procedure.

i. introduction

the eld-antield formalism, created by i. batalin and
g. vilkovisky (bv method) [1] has been used successfully
to quantize the most dicult gauge theories such as su-
pergravity theories and topological eld theories in the
lagrangian framework [24]. the bv method comprises
the faddeev-popov quantization [5] and has the brst
symmetry as fundamental principle [6]. the method has
introduced the denition of the antield which are the
sources of the brst transformation, i.e., for each eld
we have an antield canonically conjugated in terms of
the antibracket operation. with the elds, the antields
and the brst transformation we can construct the clas-
sical bv action. a mathematical ingredient, called the
antibracket, helps us to construct the fundamental equa-
tion of the formalism at the classical level, the so-called
master equation.

at the quantum level we can dene another mathe-
matical operator, the  operator, which is a second or-
der dierential operator. with the classical bv action
and presenting local counterterms, we can construct the
quantum bv action and analogously to the classical case,
the quantum master equation.

the quantization is performed via the usual functional
integration through the denition of the generating func-

tional with the help of the well known legendre trans-
formation with the respect to the sources ja. when it
is not possible to nd a solution to the quantum mas-
ter equation we can say that the theory has an anomaly.
the presence of a (0) term in the  operation demand a
method to treat this divergence conveniently. there are
various methods to regularize the theory such as pauli-
villars [7], bphz [8,9] and dimensional regularization
[10]. recently, the non-local regularization [11,12] cou-
pled with the eld-antield formalism [1315] has been
developed. the success of the last one is based on its
power to compute the anomaly of higher-loops. the
brst superspace formulation brings another construc-
tion of the main ingredients of bv formalism [16].

the skyrme model was rst proposed by t. h. r.
skyrme [17] in the sixties to incorporate baryons in the
non-linear sigma model description of the low-energy in-
teractions of pions [18]. a quantum theory can be con-
structed through the denition of the physical states
which are annihilated by operators of the rst-class con-
straints, and then we can obtain the physical values after
taking the mean value of the canonical operators.

some eorts have been performed to quantize the
skyrme model. two of us [19] have achieved this by
applying the non-abelian bfft [19,20] formalism, and
thus, employ the dirac method of rst-class constraints
to quantize the system [25]. the analysis of the physical
spectrum as well as the study of a hidden symmetry over
the ordering ambiguity problem in the skyrme model is
discussed in [26]. a formulation of the model as an em-
bedded gauge theory with the constraint deformed away
from the spherical geometry is proposed in [27].

generally the anomaly is related to the fermionic as-
pect of the skyrme-soliton physics or with the model cou-
pled to fermions. the rst-class bosonic model has the
auxiliary elds rstly introduced by l. d. faddeev [28]
to convert a second-class system in a rst-class one. in
[29], the idea of adding extra degrees of freedom has been
implemented in the bv scheme. furthermore in [30], it
was shown that the cohomology of the classical theory
has not been changed by the introduction of these new
degrees of freedon. as a consequence, the anomaly has
not disappeared, but is shifted to these extra symmetries.
hence we can say that the anomaly is in fact hidden in
this way.

the purpose of this paper is to compute, in a pre-
cise way, the value of the anomaly of the bosonic model

1

using an operatorial dirac rst-class formalism and the
non-local eld-antield formalism coupled with the fu-
jikawa procedure of regularization [31]. finally we want
to introduce some ideas about the geometry involved in
the skyrme models anomaly. the paper is organized as
follow: in section 2, the rst class skyrme action was de-
rived and the operatorial calculation of the anomaly is
developed; we have made a brief review of the non-local
bv method in section 3; in section 4, we compute the
one-loop anomaly. the nal considerations have been
made in section 5.

ii. the skyrme model and the

operatorial method

the classical static lagrangian of the skyrme model

[17] is given by

theories. this is achieved with the aid of auxiliary elds
that extend the phase space in a convenient way to trans-
form the second class into rst class constraints. this
formalism and its extension non-abelian [32] were used
for transforming the su (2) skyrme model in an abelian
and non-abelian gauge theory [19], respectively. since
a abelian gauge theory, the corresponding lagrangian is
given by

l = m + 2

ai ai
aiai  2

 

(aiai)2 ,

where i are the auxiliary elds of bfft formalism.
the new set of rst class constraints are given by

t1 = t1 + 2,
t2 = t2  aiai.

the action is written as

l =z d3r{

} ,

+

where f is the pion decay constant, e is a dimensionless
parameter and u is an su(2) matrix. performing the
collective semi-classical expansion [21], substituting u(r)
by u (r, t) = a(t)u (r)a+(t) in (1), where a is an su(2)
matrix, we obtain

l = m + t r[0a0a1],

(2)

where m is the soliton mass, which in the hedgehog rep-
resentation for u, u = exp(i  rf (r)), is given by

the su(2) matrix a can be written as a = a0 + ia

which is invariant for the following gauge transformations

where  is a constant parameter or a function dependent
on position. the noether current is obtained by using
the formula [24]

which result in

j0 =

l
 ai ai +

l
 

 ,

j0 = aii + 2 .

(13)

(14)

in the rst class dirac quantization constraints method
[25], the physical wave functions are obtained by impos-
ing the condition

t|iphys = 0,  = 1, 2,
being the operators t 1 and t 2 given by

t 1 = aiai  1 + 2,
t 2 = aii  aiai.

(15)

(16)

(17)

t1 = aiai  1  0,

i = 0, 1, 2, 3.

(5)

then, the physical states that satisfy (15) are

the lagrangian(2) can be written as a function of the ai
as

l = m + 2 ai ai.

(6)

batalin, fradkin, fradikina and tyutin [20] developed
an elegant formalism of transforming systems with sec-
ond class constraints in rst class ones, i.e., in gauge

2

|iphys =

= (aii  aiai) (aiai  1 + 2)|polynomiali, (18)
where the ket polynomial is dened as |polynomiali =
n (l) (a1 + ia2)l , and n (l) is a normalization factor. the
polynomial kets are the typical skyrmion collective coor-
dinates eigenstates [21].

taking the scalar product, physh|j0|iphys, that is the
mean value of the noether current, formula (14), we have

physh|j0|iphys =
= hpolynomial| z d d 
 (aiai  1 + 2)(aii  aiai) 
 j0(aiai  1 + 2)(aii  aiai)|polynomiali. (19)
note that due to (aiai  1 + 2) and (aii  aiai)
in (19), the scalar product can be simplied. then, inte-
grating over  and  we obtain1

(5) and, at rst, in the rst class system, it is not con-
served in time. this fact can indicate a possible anomaly
in the noether current j0.

the current anomaly can be calculated by an scalar

product given by

a =z dt physh|0j0|iphys

1

=

v 2 z dthpolynomial|0(cid:20) aii
= i(l + 1)

aiai(cid:21)sym |polynomiali
z dthpolynomial|0(1/aiai)|polynomiali.

v 2

physh| j0 |iphys =

= v hpolynomial|

aii
aiai |polynomiali.

(20)

using the denition of the momentum obtained through
4 i,
the lagrangian written in the action(10),
the anomaly a can be written as

ai = aj aj

the operator j describes a free momentum particle and
its representation on the collective coordinates space ai
is given by

a =

i (l + 1 )

2  v 2 z dthpolynomial|(cid:20)aii

aiai(cid:21)sym |polynomiali.

j = i


aj

.

(21)

the current operator inside the ket (20) must be sym-
metrized. for this we use the weyl ordering prescription
[22]. this rule expresses that the new current operator
must be constructed by counting all possible randomly
order of the ai, i and 1/(aiai). then, we can write the
symmetric current as

(cid:20) aii
aiai(cid:21)sym

=

1
aiai ajj 

i
aiai ,

(22)

where the ordering of the operator ajj/(aiai) means
that ajj acts rstly in the physical kets. the poly-
nomial states are eigenstates of the operator aii, i.e.,
aii|polynomiali = l|polynomiali. thus, the mean val-
ues of j0 is given by

physh|j0|iphys =

= i(l + 1)
= i(l + 1)

v 2

v 2

hpolynomial|

aiai |polynomiali

(23)

in the above expressions, aiai is the square of the three-
sphere collective coordinates radius. then, the poly-
nomial eigenstates do not depend of the term 1/(aiai).
moreover, the term 1/(aiai) in the denition of the mean
value of j0, eq. (23), is an curvature scalar  of the hy-
persurface dened by the second class constraint t1, eq.

1the regularization of delta function squared like (aiai
1 + 2)2 and (aii

 aiai)2 is performed by using the delta



relation, (2)2(0) = limk0r d2x eikx =r d2x = v.

3

symmetrized the operator aii/(aiai) written in the ex-
pression above, using for this again the weyl ordering
prescription, and considering that the ket polynomial is
an eigenstate of the operator aii, we can nally obtain
the expression for the anomaly a, given by

a =

(l + 1 )2

2  v 2 z dt

1

aiai

,

(24)

and from this expression we can see that the constant
terms have to be computed. next we will do this using
the bv nonlocal method nding the whole expression of
this anomaly.

iii. the field-antifield formalism with

non-local regularization

let us construct the complete set of elds, a, in-
cluding in this set the classical elds, the ghosts for all
gauge symmetries and the auxiliary elds. we can also
dene the antields 
a, which are the canonical conju-
gated variables with respect to the antibracket structure,

(x, y ) =

rx


ly
  (x  y ) ,

(25)

where the indices r and l denote, as usual, right and left
functional derivatives respectively.

one can then construct an extended action of ghost
number equal to zero, the so-called bv action, also called
classical proper solution,

s(, ) = scl() + 

ara() +

1

a

brba()

+ . . . +

n!



a1 . . . 

anran...a1 + . . .

,

(26)

where ra() are the brst generators. this action has
to satisfy the classical master equation, (s, s) = 0. at
the quantum level the action can be dened by w = s +
p mp, where the mp are the corrections (the wess-
zumino terms) to the quantum action. the quantization
of the theory is obtained with the generating functional
of the green functions:

p

p=1

(cid:2)w (, ) + j a
a(cid:3) .

(27)

z(j, ) =z d exp

i

but the denition of a path integral properly lacks on a
regularization framework.

for a theory to be free of anomalies, the quantum ac-
tion w has to be a solution of the qme, (w, w ) =
2 i   w , where   (1)a+1 r
. in the qme one
can see that when it is not possible to nd a solution, we
have an anomaly that can be dened by

r

a

a

a  (cid:20)w +

i
2

(w, w )(cid:21) (, ) .

(28)

to accomplish the regularization we will choose a
method developed recently [11,12] and that has been
adapted to the bv formalism [13,14] 2. let us dene an
action s() as being, s() = f ()+i(), where f () is
the kinetic part and i() is the interacting part, which
is an analytic function in a around a = 0. then
one can write conveniently that f () = 1
2 afabb,
where fab is called the kinetic operator. to perform
the nlr we have now to introduce a cut-o or regulat-
ing parameter 2. an arbitrary and invertible matrix
tab has to be introduced too. the combination of fab
with (t 1)ab denes a second order derivative regulator,
b = (t 1)acfcb.
ra
we can construct two important operators with these
objects. the rst is the smearing operator a
b =

exp(cid:16) ra
22 (cid:17), and the second is the shadow kinetic opera-

in order to expand our original conguration space for
each eld a, an auxiliary eld a can be constructed,

s(, ) = f ( )  a () + i ( + ) .

bb.

the second term of this auxiliary action is called the
auxiliary kinetic term, a() = 1
2 a(o1)abb. the
elds a, the smeared elds, which make part of the
auxiliary action are dened by a  (1)a
in the non-local bv formalism the conguration space
has to be enlarged introducing the antields {a, 
a}.
note that the shadow elds have antields too. then, an
auxiliary proper solution, s(, ; , ), incorporates
the auxiliary action (31) (corresponding to the gauge-
xed action s()), its gauge symmetry and the unknown
associated higher order structure functions. the auxil-
iary brst transformations are modied by the presence
a ra() in the original proper solution.
of the term 
the shadow elds have to be substituted by the solu-
tions of their classical equations of motion. at the same
time, their antields will be equal to zero. in this way we
can write s(, ) = s(, ; ,  = 0), and the clas-
sical equations of motion are r s(, ; , )/a = 0
with solutions   (, ).
nal proper solution can be written as

the complete interaction term, i(, ), of the origi-

i(, )  i() + 

a ra() + 

a 

b rba() + . . .
(32)

p=1

and the quantum action w can be expressed by w =
f + i +p
mp  f + y, where y is the generalized
quantum interaction part. it can be shown that the ex-
pression of the anomaly is the value of the nite part in
the limit 2   of
a =(cid:20)(  w )r +

(w, w )(cid:21) (, )

i
2 

(33)

and the regularized value of w is dened as (w )r 
lim2 [0] where 0 and ()a

b are dened by

b =(cid:0)a

,

(34)

b = r l s/ b  

a , iab = r l i/ a  b .
with sa
applying the limit 2   in (w )r, it can be shown
that (s)r  lim2 [0]0
, and nally that a0 
( s)r = lim2 [0]0. all the higher orders terms
of the anomaly can be obtained from equation (33), but
this will not be analyzed in this paper. it can be seen in
[14].

iv. the non-local field-antifield

quantization of the skyrme model

2for convenience, in this quite brief review, we are using the

same notation as the reference [13].

the rst-class action for the massless skyrme model

is, using (7),

4

s = z dt " 2  ai ai
ai ai 

2  i i

( ai ai )2# ,

(35)

but we already know that the rst-class tell us that 2 =
1  aiai so that  = ai ai. substituting this in (35) we
have now that

s = z dt (cid:20) 2  ai ai
ai ai 

2  (ai ai)2

( ai ai )2 (cid:21) ,

(36)

this action, as we can easily see, has a problem of non-
locality, which can be solved expanding the terms,

(n + 1)(1  ai ai)n

(37)

this action is invariant for the brst transformations
given by [23]

ai = c ai ,

c = 0 .

(38)

now we can construct the bv action,

the kinetic part of the action (35) after an integration

doing the same procedure for all the other terms one can
conclude that they are identically zero.

as we know, all the terms that depends only on c are
trivial terms cohomologically speaking, so we can con-
clude that the one-loop anomaly for the su (2) skyrme
model is the wess-zumino consistent expression [34],

a =

.

(50)

it is a new result, corroborating the general expression
founded before in eq. (24) showing an anomaly in the
conservation of the noether current j0. but at the level
of bv formalism, as well known, it represents an impos-
sibility to the solution of the qme.

b.zumino,

in this work we have considered the su (2) skyrme
model as a more general abelian gauge theory. firstly
we have quantized this gauge theory using an operatorial
dirac rst-class formalism and computing the anomaly of
the noether current as a manifestation of the gaussian
curvature of the hypersurfaces of constraints. but this
method yields an expression dependent on unknown geo-
metrical constant terms. it is the nonlocal eld-antield
formalism which discloses the whole anomaly expression.
