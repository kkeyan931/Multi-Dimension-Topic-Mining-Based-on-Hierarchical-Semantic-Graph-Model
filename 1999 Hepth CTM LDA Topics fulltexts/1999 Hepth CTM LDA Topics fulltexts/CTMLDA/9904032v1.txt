abstract

we exactly calculated the parity-odd term of the eective action induced
by the fermions in 2+1 dimensions at nite chemical potential and nite
temperature.
it shows that gauge invariance is still respected. a more
gerneral class of background congurations is considered. the knowledge of
the reduced 1+1 determinant is required in order to draw exact conclusions
about the gauge invariance of the parity-odd term in this latter case.

thanks to the exotic mathematical structure and the possible relevence to condensed matter physics
in two space dimensions, chern-simons(cs) models have drawn much attention in the past decade.
[1][2](for a review, see [3]).the cs term can be either put in by hand , or more naturaly, induced by
fermion degrees, as a part of the original (eective) lagrangian.two properties of the cs action are
fundamental. one is that it is odd under parity transform due to the presence of three dimensional
levi-civita symbol. the other is that it is invariant under small gauge transforms while non-invariant
under large gauge transforms (those not to be continuously deformed to unity and thus carrying non-
trivial winding numbers)[4]. in the free spacetime whose topology is trivial, the homotopy group 3 is
trivial in the abelian case. but there may be nontrivial large gauge transformations if the gauge elds

are subject to non-trivial boundary conditions(for a more recent discussion see[5]). in general, if there
exists non-trivial 3, the quantum theory is consistent only if the cs parameters are quantized. there
then arises a problem:what happens to the quantized parameters by quantum corrections? in the
zero temperature, the induced cs term is well-understood [6]-[10]. but at nite temperature, it was
argued [11]that the coecient of the cs term in the eective action for the gauge eld should remain
unchanged at nite temperature. yet, a naive perturbative calculation that mimics that at zero
temperature leads to a cs term with a parameter continuously dependent on the temperature[11]-[12].
therefore, the bahavior under gauge transforms seems to be temperature-dependent. the problem of
quantum corrections to the cs coecient induced by fermions at nite temperature was re-examined
in[13] , where it was concluded that, on gauge invariance grounds and in perturbation theory, the
eective action for the gauge eld can not contain a smoothly renormalized cs coecient at non-
zero temperarture. obviously, it is neccessary to obtain some exact result in order to reconcile the
contradiction. more recently, the eective action of a (0+1) analog of the 2+1 cs system was exactly
calculated [14]. it shows that in the analog, the exact nite t eective action , which is non-extensive
in temperature, has a well-dened behavior under a large gauge transformation,independent of the
temperature, even though at any given nite order of a perturbation expansion, there is a temperature
dependence. so it implies that the discussions of the gauge invariance of nite temperature eective
actions and induced cs terms in higher dimensions requires consideration of the full perturbation
series. conversely, no sensible conclusions may be drawn by considering only the rst nite number
of terms in the expansion. the course of being exactly calculable is that the gauge eld can be
made constant by gauge-transformations. employing this trick, fosco et.al. calculated exactly the
parity breaking part of the fermion determinant in 2+1 dimensions with a particular background
gauge eld. for both abelian and non-abelian caases[15][16], and the result agrees with that from
the -function methed [5]. more general background gauge elds were also considered[17]. all these
works show that (restricted to that particular ad hoc conguration) gauge invariance of the eective
action is respected even when large gauge transformations are considered.

the eect of nite chemical potential should be taken into account whenever discussing the
statistical physics of a grand canonical ensemble. it was shown that in 1+1 dimensions, the non-zero
chemical may contribute a non-trivial phase factor to the partition function[18] . the problem for
an arbitrary background in 2+1 dimensions was tackled perturbatively in [19]. as ususal, gauge
transform property of the eective action suers some temperature-dependence. therefore, it is
worthwhile considering the problem by exact computation with some particular background. this is
the topic of this paper.

as usual, the total eective action (a, m, ) is dened as

e(a,m,) = z dd  exp[z 

0

d z d2x (/ + ie 6a + m  3)]

(1)

we are using euclidean dirac matrices in the representation  = , and  is the inverse temper-
ature. it makes no dierence whether the indices are lower or upper. the label 3 refers actually to
the euclidean time component. the fermion elds are subject to antiperiodic boundary conditions
while the gauge eld are periodic. under parity transformation,

x1  x1, x2  x2, x3  x3;   1,    1; a1  a1, a2  a2, a3  a3

(2)

( matrices are kept intact). so only the mass term varies under the parity transformation. as in
[14], the parity-odd part is dened as

2(a, m, )odd = (a, m, )  (a, m, )

(3)

3

it is not an easy task to calculate (3) for general conguration of the gauge eld. a particular class
of congurations of a for which (3) can be exactly computed is that

a3 = a3( ), aj = aj(x), j = 1, 2

(4)

this class of gauge elds shares the same feature as in the 0+1 dimensions:the time dependence of
the time component can be erased by gauge transformations. therefore, the euclidean action can
be decoupled as a sum of an innite 1+1 actions

e(a,m,) = z dn(x)d n(x) exp{

1


+
x


z d2x n(x)[/d + m + i3(n + e a3)  3]n(x)}

(5)

where /d = j(j + ieaj) is the 1+1 dirac operator and a3 is the mean value of a3( ). it is seen that
the chemical potential in 2+1 dimensions plays the role of a chiral potential in 1+1 dimensions. let
us introduce n for convenience, n = n + e a3. since

where

we have therefore

m + i3n  3 = nei3n

n = q(m +   in)(m   + in)

det(/ + ie 6a + m  3) =

yn=

det[/d + nei3n]

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

explicitly, the 1+1 determinant for a given mode is a functional integral over 1+1 fermions

det[/d + nei3n] = z dnd n exp{z d2x n(x)(/d + nei3n)n(x)}

(10)

after implementing a chiral rotation whose jaccobian is wellknown (the fujikawa method applies
also to complex chiral parameters), we obtain

det[/d + m + i3(n + e a3)  3] = jndet[/d + n]

where

jn = exp(i

(11)

(12)

note that the chiral anomalies, or the jaccobianj, dependes on the boundary conditions as well.
if the sysytem is dened on a torus and the elds are subject to periodic boundary conditions,
for instance ,aj(x, y) = aj(x + lx, y), aj(x, y) = aj(x, y + ly), the trace of 5 in [20] is taken
over discrete complete set instead of the continuous plane waves. thus the momentum integral

in the following, we only concentrate on the innite space case since the conclusion on a torus can
be obtained by a trivial substitution. fortunately, we also have n(m) = n(m) for nite chemical
potential. thus we have immediately

it vanishes in the high temperature limit. it is obvious that the low temperature is very sensitive to
the values of m and , as agrees with the results perturbatively obtained [19]

since in the large-m limit (or in the low-density limit), the parity-odd part dominantes over the

eective action, and the particle number in the ensemble is < n >= 1

results in the x-dependence of n and n[15]. in place of (11), we have in this case

det[/d + m + i3(n + e a3)(x)  3] = j

(29)

suppose that m   6= 0 so that z1, z2 do not locate on the imaginary axis. now the sum can be

this is identied as the rst approximation of the total parity-odd part in [15]in the case  = 0.

it is seen from (17) that large gauge invariance is still respected at nite chemical potential as at
the vanishing chemical potential for the background (4). for the more general class (24), (34) is also
large gauge invariant, but in this case, the second factor in (25) contributes also to the parity-odd
part. therefore, it is neccessary to consider this factor in order to investigate whether the gauge
invariance of the total parity-odd part is still preserved .

in summary, we have in this letter discussed the parity-odd part of the induced eective action of
fermions in 2+1 dimensions. for the class of background eld discussed by fosco et.al., the parity-
odd part can also be exactly calculated and is also gauge invariant. for a more general background
eld conguration, the total parity-odd part of the eective action can not be obtained exactly.
the total contribution from the chiral rotation can be exactly calculated nevertheless. accordingly,
knowledge of the second factor, a massive fermion determinant, is required in order to draw rigorous
conclusions about the total eective action. the generalizations to non-abelian case as well as to
higher odd dimensions are straightforward as in [16][24].

it is clear that we still have not obtained any exact knowledge for general background gauge eld.
since (17)implies in the low-temperature limit, the everage value a will multiply the two dimesional
ux, it seems reasonable to make the following conjecture
conjecture for a general background gauge eld, the dominant part of the parity-odd term of the
induced eective action in 2+1 dimensions is
