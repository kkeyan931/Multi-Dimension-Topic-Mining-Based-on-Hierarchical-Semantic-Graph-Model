abstract

near-horizon geometry of coincident m2-branes at a conical singularity is related to m-theory
on ads4 times an appropriate seven-dimensional manifold x7. for x7 = n 0,1,0, squashing de-
formation is known to lead to spontaneous (super)symmetry breaking from n = (3, 0) to n =
(0, 1) in gauged ads4 supergravity. via ads/cft correspondence, it is interpreted as renor-
malization group ow of strongly coupled three-dimensional eld theory with su(3)  su(2)
global symmetry. the ow interpolates between n = (0, 1) xed point in the uv to n = (3, 0)
xed point in the ir. evidences for the interpretation are found both from critical points of the
supergravity scalar potential and from conformal dimension of relevant chiral primary operators
at each xed point. we also analyze cases with x7 = so(5)/so(3)max, v5,2(r), m 1,1,1, q1,1,1
and nd that there is no nontrivial renormalization group ows. we extend the analysis to en-
glert type vacua of m-theory. by analyzing de wit-nicolai potential, we nd that deformation
of s7 gives rise to renormalization group ow from n = 8, so(8) invariant uv xed point to
n = 1, g2 invariant ir xed point. for ads7 supergravity relevant for near-horizon geometry
of coincident m5-branes, we also point out a nontrivial renormalization group ow from n = 1
superconformal uv xed point to non-supersymmetric ir xed point.

introduction

few examples are known for three-dimensional interacting conformal eld theories or for renor-
malization group ows among themselves, mainly due to strong coupling dynamics in the
infrared limit. for example, n = 1 superconformal eld theories, which arise in various sit-
uations involving d-brane dynamics, do not have any continuous r-symmetries, holomorphy
constraints or any known non-renormalization theorems. in the previous paper [1], as an al-

ternative route, we have proposed to classify three-dimensional (super)conformal eld theories
by utilizing the ads/cft correspondence [2, 3, 4] and earlier, exhaustive study of the kaluza-

klein supergravity [5].

the simplest spontaneous compactication of the eleven-dimensional supergravity [6] is the
freund-rubin [7] compactication 2 to a product of ads4 spacetime and an arbitrary compact
seven-dimensional einstein manifold x7 of positive scalar curvature. continuous deformations
among x7s is of interest 3, as they would be interpreted, in the strongly interacting d = 3
quantum eld theory dual to the ads4 supergravity, to renormalization group ows among
interacting (super)conformal xed points. the best known example is provided by round and
squashed s7. the standard einstein metric of the round s7 yields a vacuum with so(8) gauge
symmetry and n = 8 supersymmetry. the s7 also admits the second, squashed einstein
metric [8], yielding a vacuum with so(5)  so(3) gauge symmetry and n = 1 or n = 0
supersymmetry, depending on the orientation of the s7 [9].

in [1], we have shown that the well-known spontaneous (super)symmetry breaking defor-
mation from round- to squashed-s7 is mapped to a renormalization group ow from n = 0
or 1, so(5)  so(3) invariant xed point in the uv to n = 8, so(8) invariant xed point
in the ir. in particular, in [1], we have shown that (1) the squashing deformation corresponds
to an irrelevant operator at the n = 8 superconformal xed point and a relevant operator at
the n = 1 or 0 (super)conformal xed point, respectively, and (2) the renormalization group
ow is described geometrically, as in ads5 supergravity [10], by a static domain wall of the
sort studied earlier in [11], which interpolates the two asymptotically ads4 spacetimes with x7
round and squashed s7s.

in this paper, we will be studying further known examples of kaluza-klein supergravity
vacua and reinterpret them in terms of three-dimensional (super)conformal eld theories and
associated renormalization group ows. first, we will be exploring various freund-rubin type
spontaneous compactications on ads4x7. for m2-branes on an eight-dimensional manifold,
the near-horizon geometry x7 is expected to change as the branes are placed at or away a

deformation between x7s of distinct topology would be extremely interesting, we are not aware of any explicit
example.

conical singularity of the manifold [12, 13]. more specically, we will consider x7 being 1) 3-
sasaki, 2) sasaki-einstein or 3) weak g2 holonomy manifolds, describing near-horizon geometry
of m2-branes at relevant conical singularities. each of them preserves (3, 0), (2, 0) and (1, 0)
supersymmetries, respectively, where (nl, nr) denotes chirality of supercharges on ads4.

in section 2, by analyzing relevant scalar potentials developed by yasuda [14, 15] for each case,
we will be nding further examples of supergravity dual to a three-dimensional quantum eld
theory exhibiting a nontrivial renormalization group ow.

i,ii

has been studied originally
by castellani and romans [16], identied as a coset manifold of the form [su(3)u(1)]/[u(1)
u(1)]. embedding of [u(1)  u(1)] in [su(3)  u(1)] is specied by a choice of the integers
(p, q, r). each choice of p, q, r leads to an einstein manifold, yielding n = (3, 0) supersymmetry
and su(3)su(2) gauge symmetry for n 0,1,0, or n = (1, 0) supersymmetry and su(3)u(1)
gauge symmetry otherwise. later, page and pope [17] have completed the coset manifold
construction by showing existence of another series of einstein manifold, n p,q,r
those corresponding to q = 0. the n p,q,r
of the n p,q,r
supersymmetry.

, except for
s, which can be obtained from geometric squashing
s, retain the same gauge group as the latter but instead preserve n = (0, 1)

i

as in the case of x7 = s7, the existence of two einstein metrics on n p,q,rs oers an inter-
pretation in terms of spontaneous (super)symmetry breaking: scalar eld corresponding to the
squashing deformation acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value, leading to (super)-higgs
mechanism. the symmetry breaking pattern depends on the choice of the x7 orientation.
with one orientation, for n 0,1,0s, the squashing interpolates between a n = 3 supersymmetric
vacuum and another with n = 0 supersymmetry. with opposite orientation, it interpolates
between a non-supersymmetric vacuum and a supersymmetry restored one with n = 1 su-
persymmetry. in both cases, however, the gauge group is locally su(3)  su(2) and remains
unbroken.

via ads/cft correspondence, this implies that the three-dimensional quantum eld theory
dual to the ads4  n 0,1,0 supergravity exhibits two types of nontrivial renormalization group
ow: one between n = 3 superconformal uv xed point and non-supersymmetric ir xed
point, and another between nonsupersymmetric uv xed point and n = 1 superconformal ir
xed point. for both, along the renormalization group ow trajectory, the global symmetry
su(3)  su(2) is always maintained. analogously, for all other n p,q,rs except q = 0, the dual

2

quantum eld theory exhibits two renormalization group ows between n = 1 superconformal
xed point and nonsupersymmetric one. we present these analysis in section 2.1.

in section 2.2, we will be studying other examples of x7s. we will nd that n p,q,r
s
i,ii
give rise to a nontrivial , su(3)  u(1) invariant renormalization group ow between n = 1
superconformal xed point and nonsupersymmetric conformal xed point. on the other hand,
for x7 = m 1,1,1, q1,1,1, v5,2(r), so(5)/so(3)max, it turns out the squashing deformation does
not lead to any nontrivial renormalization group ow 4.

we next consider m-theory compactication vacua of englert type. by generalizing com-
pactication vacuum ansatz to the nonlinear level, solutions of the eleven-dimensional super-

gravity were obtained directly from the scalar and pseudo-scalar expectation values at various
critical points of the n = 8 supergravity potential [19]. this way, it was possible to reproduce
all known kaluza-klein solutions of the eleven-dimensional supergravity: round s7 [20], so(7)
invariant, parallelized s7 [21], so(7)+-invariant vacuum [22], su(4)-invariant vacuum [23],
and a new one with g2 invariance. among them, round s7- and g2-invariant vacua are stable,
while so(7)-invariant ones are known to be unstable [24]. in all these vacua, generically, ei-
ther the metric is endowed with a nontrivial warp factor or the four-form magnetic ux gabcd is
nonvanishing, corresponding to turning on vacuum expectation values for scalar or pseudoscalar
eld, respectively. novelty of vacua with a nontrivial warp factor is that they corresponds to
inhomogeneous deformations of s7. in section 3, we will analyze the above vacua by inves-
tigating de wit-nicolai potential. we will be identifying a deformation which gives rise to a
renormalization group ow associated with the symmetry breaking so(8)  g2 (both of which
are stable vacua) and nd that the deformation operator is relevant at the so(8) xed point
but becomes irrelevant at the g2 xed point.

in section 4, we study near-horizon geometry of coincident m5-branes, which are described
by ads7 gauged supergravity. the geometrical interpretation of seven dimensional solutions
from the eleven dimensional viewpoint has been obtained recently [25]. by taking a nonlinear
kaluza-klein ansatz to the eleven-dimensional supergravity, they were able to obtain a consis-
tent s4 reduction to seven-dimensional, n = 1 gauged supergravity. field content of the latter
includes a scalar eld parametrizing inhomogeneous deformations of the s4, yang-mills gauge
elds, and a topologically massive three-form potential. turning on the scalar eld induces

again spontanous (super)symmetry breaking, and we interpret it as being dual to a renormal-
ization group ow from n = 1 supersymmetric uv xed point to a nonsupersymmetric ir
xed point of a putative d = 6,n = (1, 0) quantum theory. the existence of stable, nonsuper-
symmetric d = 6 conformally invariant quantum theory should be of considerable interest [26],

as the latter includes noncritical bosonic strings as part of the spectrum.

4other aspects of three-dimensional superconformal eld theories from sasaki seven-manifold have been

studied in [18].

3d cfts from freund-rubin compactications

spontaneous compactication of m-theory to ads4x7 is obtained from near-horizon geometry
of n coindicent m2-branes. the conguration is equivalent to freund-rubin compactication
of the eleven-dimensional supergravity: through x7, the m2-branes thread nonvanishing ux

the parameter q refers to so-called page charge [27], q  4rx 7(g + c  g). here, the
d = 11 coordinates with indices a, b,   are decomposed into ads4 coordinates x with indices
, ,   and x7 coordinates y with indices a, b,  . we will also adopt the eleven-dimensional
metric convention as (, +,   , +). a weyl rescaling of ads4 and x7, appropriate for m-theory
description, is given by g  e7sg and gab  e2sgab.

in this section, we will be studying critical points of the scalar potential for various choices of
x7 and, in the corresponding three-dimensional conformal eld theories, identifying an operator
that gives rise to a renormalization group ow among the critical points.

2.1 n 0,1,0 space

we will begin with the case x7 = n p,q,r space [16], which is a homogeneous space [su(3) 
u(1)]/[u(1)  u(1)]. consider a subset of all continuous deformation of n p,q,r, in which the
vielbein b is given by

here, a(a = 1, 2), 3, a(a = 4, 5), a(a = 6, 7), 8 and 3 are the left invariant one-
forms corresponding to the coset generators a, 3, a, a, 8 of su(3) and the generator of
u(1) factor respectively. the integer p, q, r characterize the embedding of u(1)  u(1) in
su(3)  u(1). it is convenient to dene

it is known [16] that for a particular choice of p, q, r the isometry of n p,q,r is su(3)  su(2)
in which n = 3 supersymmetry survives. we call it type i solution. for all the other values of
p, q, r, supersymmetry is broken to n = 1 and the isometry group is su(3)u(1). moreover, as
we mentioned in the introduction, page and pope worked out a dierent construction of metrics
on the n 0,1,0 space and showed that there exists an another einstein metric , squashed from the
rst. the isometry is su(3)su(2) and the supersymmetry is n = (0, 1). we call this type ii
solution. strictly speaking, the analysis of killing spinors in [17] shows that a possible dierent
root of squashing parameter gives dierent supersymmetry. in other words, type i solutions
are known to preserve (3, 0). similarly, the case of type ii solutions have (0, 1) supersymmetry.

thus for the squashing with left-handed orientation, the renormalization group ow interpolates
between the boundary conformal eld theories with n = 3 and n = 0 supersymmetry while
for the squashing with right-handed orientation, the ow interpolates between conformal eld
theories with n = 0 and n = 1. from now on we will restrict foregoing discussions to
(p, q, r) = (0, 1, 0) case.

 type i solution for the space n 0,1,0
type i solution with n = (3, 0), as studied by castellani and roman [16], is dened by

conformal dimension of the perturbation operator representing squashing is determined by

via ads/cft correspondence, one nds that in d = 3 conformal eld theory with n = 3
supersymmetry, the squashing ought to be an irrelevant perturbation of conformal dimension
 = 4 for u, v elds and an relevant perturbation of conformal dimension  = 2 or  = 1 for

w eld. according to the result of [29], mass spectrum of the lichnerowitz scalar eld  can
be obtained from that of transverse spinor t via m2
 = mt(mt  4) in the normalization
convention, (2  32 + m2
) = 0. moreover, from [30], mt = d + 3, where d is the dirac
operator of each spinor harmonics. hence, canonically normalized mass of the lichnerowitz
2 = (d + 3)(d 1) + 32. unfortunately, at present, complete eigenvalues
scalar is given by gm
of the dirac operator d is not known for the transverse harmonics, even though there have
been attempts recently to classsify the full mass spectra [31]. we anticipate that the linear
combination of masses of u and v elds should correspond to gm

the so(5)/so(3)max seven-manifold is constructed from maximal embedding of so(3) in

so(5). let us consider squashing each coset direction as specied by the vielbein:

b = (

0),

where a(a = 1, 2, 3), a(a = 1, 2, 3) and 0 are the left invariant one-forms corresponding to
the generators x a, x a, x 0 of so(5), respectively. parametrizing as

 = es+(u+v)/2,  = es+(uv)/2,  = es3u,

the squashing deformation can be summarized compactly in terms of the following four-dimensional

eective lagrangian [15]:

here, the scalar potential is given by

30eu  16e(5u+v)/2(cid:17) + q2e21s.

again, q is the conserved page charge. it is straightforward to check that there exists only

one critical point, u = v = 0. in the subspace of the perturbations considered above, one nds
that the strongly interacting d = 3 quantum eld theory dual to ads4  so(5)/so(3)max has
only one isolated (super)conformal xed point, hence, no nontrivial renormalization group ow.

the v5,2(r) is a real stiefel manifold, constructed by embedding so(3) in so(5) in such
a way that 5 of so(5) branches into 3 of so(3) plus two singlets. the isometry of v5,2(r) is
so(5)  so(2). consider deformations rescaling each coset direction as

to the generators x m = t 4m, x m = t 5m, x 0 = t 45 where t ij(i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are generators
of so(5). in terms of parametrization

 = es+(u+v)/2,  = es+(uv)/2,  = es3u,

the four-dimensional eective lagrangian [15] can be written as

and q is the page charge. the potential exhibits only one critical point at u = 1
2, v = 0.
as in so(5)/so(3)max case, there is no renormalization group ow in the corresponding three-
dimensional conformal eld theory.

t3  3t2 + 4t  4 = (t  2)(t2  t + 2) = 0.

one nds that there is no extra critical point except t = 2. hence, one concludes that there

theory.

found in [1] is marked , while the ones found in section 2.1 and 2.2 are marked  and .

we have summarized our result of this section in table 1. in the subspace of squashing
s turn out

deformations considered, among various known x7s, we have found that only n p,q6=0,r
to be dual to nontrivial renormalization group ows of strongly coupled three-dimensional eld
theories, connecting two (super)conformal xed points. one novelty of these conformal eld

i,ii

theories is that, even though the superconformal symmetry is changed, the global symmetry is
not changed at all, in contrast to the deformation interpolating between round- and squashed-s7
[1].

although we have not considered nonsupersymmetric seven-manifolds m p,q,r or qp,q,r in
this paper, it is known that m p,q,r remains stable for the specic region of 98/243  p2/q2 
6358/4563 and qp,q,r solutions are stable in a certain region containing the point p = q = r = 1.
we therefore anticipate that, if there exists more than one critical points of the corresponding

scalar potential, they will provide gravity dual to strongly interacting, stable, nonsupersymmet-
ric eld theories in three dimensions, whose renormalization group ows interpolate interacting

conformal xed points [26].

3d cfts from englert compactications

so far, we have deduced existence of three-dimensional conformal eld theories out of freund-
rubin compactication of m-theory. let us now consider more general compactications by

12

relaxing the restriction that the eleven-dimensional metric is a product space and that there is
no magnetic four-form eld strength ux threaded on x7. the rst solution of this sort has
been found by englert [21]. in contrast to the freund-rubin compactications, the symmetry
of the vacuum is no longer given by the isometry group of x7 but rather by the group which
leaves invariant both the metric gab and four-form magnetic eld strength gabcd. in the englert
compactication [21], nonvanishing gabcd on the round s7 breaks so(8) down to so(7). precise
interpretation of englert compactication in terms of microscopic conguration of coincident

m2-branes is still lacking. nevertheless, ads/cft correspondence implies that there ought to
be a three-dimensional (super)conformal eld theory for each englert-type compactication as

well.

in kaluza-klein supergravity, it is well-known that the four-dimensional n = 8 gauged
supergravity can be embedded consistently into the eleven-dimensional supergravity. as shown
in [32], the 70 scalars of n = 8 supergravity live on the coset space e7/su(8) and are described
by an element v(x) of the fundamental 56-dimensional representation (56-bein) of e7 :

v(x) =" uij

ij (x)

vijkl(x)

kl(x) # ,

vklij(x) ukl

ij ) = uij

where su(8) index pairs [ij],   and so(8) index pairs [ij],   are antisymmetrized and there-
fore u and v are 28  28 matrices. complex conjugation is done by raising or lowering indices,
for example, (uij
ij. under local su(8) and local so(8), the matrix v(x) transforms as
v(x)  u(x)v(x)o1(x), where u(x)  su(8) and o(x)  so(8) and matrices u(x), o(x)
are elements of the 56-dimensional representation. by appropriate gauge xing of the local
su(8) symmetry, the 56-bein v(x) can be brought into the following form:

v(x) = exp"

0

4 mnpq

# ,

where ijkl is a complex self-dual tensor describing the 35 scalars 35v(the real part of ijkl) and
35 pseuoscalar elds 35c(the imaginary part of ijkl) of the n = 8 supergravity. note that,
after gauge xing, there is no distinction between so(8) and su(8) indices.

the scalar potential of the gauged n = 8 supergravity is known to possess four critical
points with at least g2 invariance [33]. the maximally supersymmetric vacuum with so(8)
symmetry, s7, is where expectation value of both scalar and pseudoscalar elds vanish. let us
deonte self-dual and anti-self-dual tensors of so(8) tensor as c ijkl
, respectively,
satisfying

turning on the scalar elds proportional to c ijkl
wise, turning on pseudoscalar elds proportional to c ijkl

yields an so(7)+ invariant vacuum. like-
yields so(7) invariant vacuum.

13

both so(7) vacua are nonsupersymmetric. however, simulatneously turning on both scalars
and pseudoscalar elds proportional to c ijkl
, respectively, one obtains g2-invariant
vacuum with n = 1 supersymmetry 7. the most general vacuum expectation value of 56-bein
retaining g2-invariance can be parametrized as

in this section, we will be identifying a renormalization group ow associated with global
symmetry breaking so(8)  g2 in a three-dimensional strongly coupled eld theory 8. we
will show that the perturbation operator is relevant at the so(8) invariant uv xed point
but becomes irrelevant at the g2 invariant ir xed point. to identify conformal eld theory
operator corresponding to the perturbation while preserving g2 symmetry, we will consider
harmonic uctuations of spacetime metric and  scalar eld around ads4  s7. from the

where ruv is the radius of ads4 and pl is the eleven-dimensional planck scale. conformal di-

then, from the explicit forms of uij

via ads/cft correspondence, one nds that in the corresponding n = 8 superconformal eld

8as the so(7) vacua are unstable [24], we will not consider in the foregoing discussions.

to so(8) dynkin label (n, 0, 2, 0) is given by

where m2 is mass-squared parameter of a given ads4 spacetime and a scalar eld s is dened

gm 2 =(cid:16)(n + 1)2  9(cid:17) m2

by (ads +gm 2)s = 0. this follows from the known mass formula [35] m 2 = ((n + 1)2  1)m2
for o(1) and the fact that m 2 is traditionally dened according to (ads  8m2 + m 2) = 0.
for 35c corresponding to n = 0, gm 2
35c = 8m2 and this ought to equal to eq.(8). recalling

s7/4 = 1/4m2,

uv = r2

that r2

on the other hand, the mass spectrum of the representation corresponding to so(8) dynkin

label (n + 2, 0, 0, 0) is given by gm 2 = ((n  1)2  9) m2. this follows from the known mass
formula [35] m 2 = ((n  1)2  1)m2 for o+(1). for 35v corrsponding to n = 0, gm 2
35v = 8m2

and this ought to equal to eq. (8).

let us next consider the conformal xed point corresponding to the g2 symmetry. again,

from the scalar potential eq.(7), one nds that cosmological constant  is given by

the mass spectrum for the  eld around g2 xed point takes a positive value:

.

one nds that in the corresponding three-dimensional conformal eld theory with n = 1 super-
symmetry, the g2 symmetric deformation ought to be an irrelevant perturbation of conformal
dimension  = 4.448.... we thus conclude that the perturbation operator dual to the  eld
induces nontrivial renormalization group ow from n = 8 superconformal uv xed point with
so(8) symmetry to n = 1 superconformal ir xed point with g2 symmetry.

it is known that, in n = 8 supergravity, there also exists a n = 2 supersymmetric,
su(3)u(1) invariant vacuum [36]. to reach this critical point, one has to turn on expectation
values of both scalar and pseudoscalar elds as

ow between n = 8 so(8) xed point and n = 2 su(3)  u(1) xed point.

6d cfts from inhomogeneous compactication

we nally study the case of near-horizon geometry of coincident m5-branes, as described by
ads7 gauged supergravity. recently, in [25], geometrical interpretation for vacua in seven-
dimensional n = 1 gauged supergravity has been given in terms of englert type compactica-
tion of eleven-dimensional supergravity, having nonvanishing electric or tilted magnetic four-

form uxes and inhomogeneous metric deformation, by a set of consistent nonlinear ansatz.
the inhomogeneous deformations of the s4 is parametrized by a scalar , eld , while the
su(2) gauge elds, which are the surviving subgroup of the so(5) yang-mills elds of the
maximal gauged supergravity after the deformation, are associated with the right translations

under the su(2). the full two parameter potential of the resulting seven-dimensional gauged
supergravity turns out equal to [37] (see also [38]):

v () = 16 h2 e 8

the present case, the stability bound yields s = 9 when d = 7. eq.(10) is less than the bound,
hence, is stable. in fact, the vacuum is n = 1 supersymmetric. conformal dimension of the
perturbation operator representing the squashing is calculated by uctuation spectrum of the
scalar elds. from eq.(10), via ads/cft correspondence, one nds that, in six-dimensional
n = (1, 0) superconformal eld theory, the perturbation operator representing the scalar eld
deformation ought to be a relevant perturbation of conformal dimension  = 2 or  = 4.

dual to the critical point is a six-dimensional conformal eld theory with no supersymmetry, for
which the perturbation associated with the squashing deformation is an irrelevant perturbation

one thus nds that, in the subspace representing inhomogeneous deformation of s4, there
ought to be a six-dimensional quantum theory which interpolates between n = (1, 0) super-
conformal xed point in the uv and nonsupersymmetric xed point in the ir. note that
the coformal eld theory around the ir xed point is a stable one, despite absence of any

supersymmetry, which follows from the general argument of [26]. existence of a stable, non-
supersymmetric d = 6 conformal eld theory would be of considerable interest, as the theory

would contain stable, noncritical bosonic strings as part of the spectra.
