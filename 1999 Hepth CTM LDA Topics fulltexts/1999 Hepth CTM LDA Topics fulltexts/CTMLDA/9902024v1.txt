abstract

various uid mechanical systems enjoy a hidden, higher-dimensional dynam-
ical poincare symmetry, which arises owing to their descent from a nambu-
goto action. also, for the same reason, there are equivalence transformations
between dierent models. these interconnections, summarized by the diagram
below, are discussed in our paper.

i. introduction

in this paper we shall be concerned with nonlinear dynamical systems that are described by
a density of matter , owing in time {t} with local velocity v on a d-dimensional surface
coordinated by {r}. the vectorial nature of v is not unrestricted: v is a function of ,
where  is a velocity potential, and we shall examine several such functions. (when v is
linear in , the ow is irrotational,   v = 0.) the density is linked to the velocity by a
continuity equation involving the matter current j = v,

(t, r) +  (cid:16)v(t, r)(t, r)(cid:17) = 0

while the velocity satises an euler equation

v(t, r) + v(t, r)  v(t, r) = f(, v) .

(1.1)

(1.2)

[the over-dot always indicates dierentiation with respect to the temporal argument, while
the gradient  (unless further specied) dierentiates the spatial argument.]

we shall examine theories with various expressions for the force (per unit mass) f, which
lead to galileo, poincare and additional unexpected kinematical symmetries of the equations,
and which sometimes produce completely integrable systems, with an innite number of
local conserved quantities. the existence of a velocity potential  allows the above equations
to be formulated with an action principle, which is usually unavailable for this purpose.
consequently the symmetries that we nd are in fact noether symmetries, which leave the
action invariant.

additionally, we shall present limiting and equivalence transformations between dierent

models, which allow mapping solutions of one model onto solutions of another.

various topics that we discuss have already appeared in the literature. a common fea-
ture unites the diverse models that we study: they have a common antecedent in that
they can be gotten from a parametrization-invariant nambu-goto action for a d-brane on
a d + 1-dimensional space, moving in (d + 1, 1)-dimensional space-time.
[a d-brane is a
d-dimensional extended object: d = 1 is a string, d = 2 is a membrane, etc. a d-brane inhab-
iting d + 1-dimensional space divides that space in two.] when a light-cone parametrization
is selected for the nambu-goto problem, one derives the euler and continuity equations
for a d-dimensional chaplygin gas [in eq. (1.2), f  1
3 ]. alternatively, a cartesian
parametrization produces the d-dimensional born-infeld model (see below).

the relation between membranes and planar uid mechanics (the d = 2 case) was known
to goldstone [1], and was developed by his student hoppe (with collaboration) [2]. similar
connections, yielding equations in one spatial dimension, were discussed by nutku (and
collaborators) [3]. here we consider the general d-dimensional case, and use the common
ancestry of the various uid-mechanical models to posit unexpected transformations between
them, and to identify hidden, dynamical symmetries in each model, which derive from the
high degree of symmetry of nambu-goto parent theory.

for d = 1, the models that we study become especially simple for two reasons. first, their
common antecedent is a string (1-brane) moving on a plane (2-space), and for this system
the nambu-goto equations are integrable [4]. second, the requirement that velocity be
expressible in terms of a potential poses no restriction in one dimension, where any function
can be related to the derivative of another function. in this way one may understand that
the d = 1 models are completely integrable, as has been noted previously [35].

2

in section ii we consider noninteracting systems, with galileo- and poincare-invariant
kinetic terms. specic interactions that preserve galileo and poincare symmetry, as well
as higher, dynamical symmetries are discussed in section iii. the relation of these to the
nambu-goto theory is explained in section iv, where we also exhibit mappings between
the galileo-invariant and the poincare-invariant models. the last section v is devoted to
models in one spatial dimension.

ii. force-free motion

the force-free problem, f = 0, describes the free ow of dust. eqs. (1.1) and (1.2) are readily
solved in terms of initial data, specied (without loss of generality) at t = 0

(t, r)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0
v(t, r)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0

= 0(r)

= v0(r) .

upon dening the retarded position q(t, r) by the equation

one veries that (1.1) and (1.2), with vanishing right side, are solved by

q + tv0(q) = r

v(t, r) = v0(q)

(t, r) = 0(q)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) det

(2.1)

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

the free equations, with v restricted to a function of , possess a variational action
formulation, which was rst given by eckart for galileo-invariant nonrelativistic motion [6].
we reproduce and generalize his argument.

the lagrangian for n point-particles of mass m in free nonrelativistic motion is the
galileo-invariant kinetic energy 1
in a continuum description, the particle
counting index n becomes the continuous variable r, and the particles are distributed with

n=1 mv2

n(t).

density , so that pn

density with the current by the continuity equation (1.1), which can be enforced with the
help of a lagrange multiplier . we thus arrive at the free continuum lagrangian

n(t) becomes r ddr (t, r)v2(t, r). but we also wish to link the

n=1 v2

2pn

lgalileo =z ddrh 1

2 mv2 + (cid:16)  +   (v)(cid:17)i .

since l is rst-order in time, and the canonical 1-formr ddr  dt does not contain v, v may

be varied, evaluated and eliminated [7]. we nd

showing that  is the local momentum p = mv, and the velocity is irrotational:

mv   = 0

v =

  v = 0 .

the lagrangian (2.6) becomes

()2

2m (cid:21)

(2.9)

where the subscript 0 denotes absence of interaction.

varying  in (2.9) regains the continuity equation (1.1), while varying  produces the free

bernoulli equation for the velocity potential 

 +

2m

()2 = 0 .

(2.10)

this is also recognized as the free hamilton-jacobi equation. the gradient of (2.10) gives
rise, in view of (2.8), to the free euler equation (1.2) (with f = 0).

remarkably the same equations emerge for a kinetic energy t that is an arbitrary function

of v. if we generalize (2.6) to

l0 =z ddrht (v) + (  +   (v)i

t (v)
v  p = 

we get, instead of (2.7),

and (2.9) becomes

l0 =z ddr(cid:20)   (cid:18)v 

t (v)

v  t (v)(cid:19)(cid:21)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

where it is understood that the legrendre transform of t is expressed in terms of  by
inverting (2.12).

varying  in (2.13) again gives the continuity equation,

0 =

while varying  leaves a generalization of the free bernoulli equation:

0 =

+ t (v) .

with the help of (2.12), this implies


ri

rivj = vj 2
rjvi = vj vk

on the other hand, from (2.12) it follows that

eqs. (2.16a) and (2.16b) are consistent only if the free euler equation (1.2) holds (provided
the matrix  2t

vivj has an inverse).

v remains irrotational
while the velocity, as determined by inverting (2.12), becomes a nonlinear function of .

with a general form for t (v), the local momentum (2.12) p  t
evidently the solution (2.1)(2.5) works with arbitrary kinetic energy, whose specic
form enters only in the xing the relation between v and . however, the initial data for
the velocity must be consistent with the expression of the velocity in terms of .

one may present a family of constants of motion:

c =z ddr (t, r)c(cid:16)v(t, r), r  tv(t, r)(cid:17) .

(2.17)

the time independence of c is established either by dierentiating with respect to t and
using the free equations of motion to prove that dc
dt = 0, or more easily, by inserting the
solution (2.3)(2.5) into (2.17) and changing integration variables from r to q. (carrying out
these manipulations requires assuming that 0 and v0 obey appropriate regularity conditions
and drop o suciently at large distances.)

various constants of motion arise from invariance against time and space translation (en-
ergy e and total momentum p, respectively) as well as space rotation (angular momentum
lij), provided t (v) carries no explicit time and coordinate dependence, and does not depend
on any external vectors, i.e., t (v) = t (v). these constants are

e = h =z ddr h
h = (cid:16)v 
p =z ddr p
lij =z ddr (rip j  rjp i) .

p =  =

v

also shifting  by a constant is a symmetry, leading to conservation of

n =z ddr  .

(2.18)

(2.19)

(2.20)

(2.21)

to recognize that these constants of motion involve particular forms for c(v, r  tv) in
(2.17), we recall that according to (2.12)  is a function of v, and the two are colinear
when t (v) = t (v).

the densities h and p are components of an energy-momentum tensor, t 00 and t 0i
respectively, which satisfy continuity equations with energy ux t i0 and momentum ux t ij

t 00 = h
t i0 = vih
t 0i = p i
t ij = vip j .

(2.22a)
(2.22b)
(2.22c)
(2.22d)

[t ij is symmetric when t (v) = t (v).] the continuity equations

ri t i0 = 0

ri t ij = 0

(2.23a)

(2.23b)

are entirely equivalent to the free dynamical equations (1.1) and (1.2), with vanishing force.
the symplectic structure, which is determined by the canonical 1-form in (2.13), indicates

that the only nonvanishing bracket is [7]

or equivalently

{(t, r), (t, r)} = (r  r)
{p(t, r), (t, r)} = (r  r) .

(2.24)

(2.25)

with these, one veries that the constants of motion (2.18)(2.21) generate the appropriate
innitesimal transformation on the variables  and .

specic forms for t (v) support additional, kinematical symmetries and lead to further
in the nonrelativistic case presented in eqs. (2.6)(2.10), we have
constants of motion.
galileo invariance against boosts by velocity u. the transformation law for the elds reads

(t, r)  u(t, r) = (t, r)
(t, r)  u(t, r) = (t, r) + m(u  r  u2t/2)

where the transformed coordinates are boosted:

t  t = t

r  r(t, r) = r  tu .

(2.26)

(2.27)

the inhomogenous terms in u are recognized as the well-known 1-cocycle of eld theoretic
realizations of the galileo group. also they ensure that the transformation for the velocity
v = /m

v(t, r)  vu(t, r) = v(t, r  tu) + u

is appropriate for the co-moving velocity.

the conserved quantity arising from the galileo symmetry is

b = tp  mz ddr r
= mz ddr (r  tv)

(2.28)

(2.29)

where the last equality casts b in the form (2.17). with the help of the bracket (2.24), b
generates the innitesimal transformation on the elds, and its bracket with p closes on n,
thereby exposing the familiar galileo 2-cocycle, which provides an extension of the algebra:

{bi, p j} = ijmn .

(2.30)

the free galileo-invariant theory possesses further symmetries, which survive even in the
presence of a particular interaction. hence we postpone discussing them until later, when
interactions are included.

6

in the subsequent, in addition to the galileo-invariant case, we shall also be concerned
with a relativistic, poincare-invariant model for which the point-particle kinetic energy is
n(t)/c2. upon passing to a continuum description, as in the nonrelativistic

case, we nd

with the last equality exhibiting the form (2.17). the transformation laws for  and

ensure that j = (1, v/c) and u  = (1, v/c)
that q1  v2/c2 and  are scalars [8]. the equation of motion (2.15) for  together with

(2.31)(2.33) implies that the lorentz vector  satises a lorentz-invariant equation

(2.41)

()2 = m2c2 .

(2.42)

note that the lorentz transformation law (2.37) for  does not involve a 1-cocycle, which
is a nonrelativistic eect.
it is interesting to see how (2.26) arises in the nonrelativistic
limit. by comparing the relativistic action (2.39) to the nonrelativistic one, we see that the
relationship between r and nr  the relativistic and nonrelativistic variables  is

r = nr  mc2t .

(2.43)

applying the lorentz transformation law (2.37) to r implies that nr(t, r)  mc2t 
nr(t, r)  mc2t or nr(t, r)  nr(t, r) + mc2(t  t ). we evaluate the nonrelativistic
limit of the last quantity from (2.38) and nd mc2(t t )  m(u r u2t/2), which matches
the 1-cocycle in (2.26).
similar to the galileo-invariant theory, this poincare-invariant model possesses further
symmetries, which we shall discuss below, when we include an interaction that preserves
them.

iii. motion in the presence of interactions

a. nonrelativistic motion

interactions that preserve the galileo symmetry of the free, nonrelativistic motion can be
included by adding a -independent potential v () to the lagrangian (2.9):

lgalileo

v

=z ddr(cid:20)   

()2

2m  v ()(cid:21) .

(3.1)

with nonvanishing v , (2.3)(2.5) are no longer solutions, and the quantity (2.17) with
arbitrary c(v, r  tv) is no longer constant. of course the galileo generators (2.18)(2.21)
and (2.29), with

h = 

()2

2m

+ v ()

8

(3.2)

remain time independent. the energy-momentum tensor retains the form (2.22), with h
given by (3.2); in t i0, h of (3.2) is diminished by v   v
 ; t 0i is unchanged and t ij
acquires the addition ij(cid:16)v   v
(cid:17).

the dynamics implied by (3.1) arise in diverse physical contexts. the most directly
physical application is to isentropic, irrotational motion in uid mechanics with the force
f () =  v ()
is the speed of sound [9]. al-
ternatively one nds (3.1) (with v depending also on ) in the hydrodynamical formulation
of quantum mechanics, which emerges when the wave function is presented as [10]

corresponding to the enthalpy and (cid:16)  2v ()

2 (cid:17)1/2



 = 1/2ei/ .

(3.3)

[in this context, the inhomogenous galileo transformation of  (2.26) corresponds to the fa-
miliar change of phase in a wave function under galileo boosts, while shifting  by a constant
is just the phase-invariance of quantum mechanics, which leads to probability conservation,
i.e., constant n in (2.21).]

but we shall be especially concerned with the case

v () = /

(3.4)

which arises in the study of d-branes  d-dimensional extended objects  moving on
a (d + 1)-dimensional space, in (d + 1, 1)-dimensional space-time, and descending from a
nambu-goto action (see section iv) [1,2]. furthermore, (3.4) arises in the nonrelativistic
limit of a poincare-invariant model with interactions, which we shall also describe below.

these are the equations for a chaplygin gas.

(3.5)

(3.6)

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

for this model there exist further symmetry transformations [11]. the action i galileo

=
is invariant against a rescaling of time, with parameter , under which the elds

change according to

(t, r)  (t, r) = e(et, r)
(t, r)  (t, r) = e(et, r)

9

(3.10)

and the time-independent generator of the innitesimal transformation is

d = th z ddr  .

(3.11)

furthermore, the action is also invariant against a eld-dependent dieomorphism, implicitly
dened by

t  t (t, r) = t +   r + 1
r  r(t, r) = r + (t, r)/m

22(t, r)/m

where the transformed elds are

(t, r)  (t, r) = (t, r)
(t, r)  (t, r) = (t, r)

and |j| is the jacobian of the transformation.

here  is a (vectorial) parameter of the transformation, with dimension of (velocity)1, and
the time-independent quantity

generates the innitesimal transformation.

note that the generators d and g remain time-independent even in absence of the
interaction (3.4), hence these symmetries are also present for the free theory. the generators
are not of the form (2.17): they involve , and cannot be written in terms of v = /m.
finally we note that bracketing of the additional generators with the galileo generators
of the nonrelativistic theory on a (d, 1)-dimensional space-time produces an algebra which
is isomorphic to the poincare group in (d + 1, 1) dimensions, [2,12] under which (t, , r)
transforms as a (d + 2)-lorentz vector x  in light-cone components (t = x +,  = x ) [4].
using (3.7), we may eliminate , and describe the model solely in terms of , whose

dynamics is governed by the lagrangian

l = 2z ddrs  +

()2

2m

.

(3.16)

it is seen that the interaction strength  in fact disappears from the equations of motion for
;  serves only to normalize the lagrangian. in the free theory it is not possible to achieve
this compact formulation. furthermore, the dynamical equations can be summarized by an
equation for , which follows from (3.6), once (3.7) is used to eliminate , or alternatively
the equation is derived from (3.16)

(3.17)

in spite of their awkward appearance, (3.16) and (3.17) are galileo invariant in (d, 1) space-
time, and possess a hidden, nonlinearly realized poincare symmetry in (d + 1, 1) space-time
(which is a descendant of the symmetries of the nambu-goto action; see section iv).

apart from the intrinsic interest in this nonlinear realization of a kinematical/dynamical
poincare symmetry, which is provided by (3.10)(3.15) supplementing the linearly realized
galileo symmetry, the new symmetries have the useful consequence of generating new solu-
tions to the equations of motion (3.6)(3.9) from old ones. for example, the time-rescaling
invariant, particular solution

mr2

2(d  1)t

(t, r) = 
(t, r) =s 2

md

(d  1)|t|

r

(3.18)

can be transformed by (3.12)(3.14) into new solutions  and , which are very dierent
in character from (3.18) [11]. note that in (3.18) we must have d > 1 and  > 0.

at d = 1, we can obtain general, time-rescaling invariant solutions. with the ansatz
  1/t, (3.17) leads to a second order dierential equation for the x-dependence of .
therefore solutions involve two arbitrary constants, one of which xes the origin of x, and
can be ignored. the other, which we call k, appears in two distinct families of solutions
(which are related by an imaginary shift of x):

(3.19a)

(3.19b)

for real , k must be real or imaginary. when a real  is computed from (3.7), we nd that
k must be real for  > 0, imaginary for  < 0, and a nonsingular density exists only with
(3.19a) for  > 0

in arbitrary spatial dimension, is given by

(t, r) = (bn  r) + mu  r  1

2 mt(cid:16)u2  (bn  u)2(cid:17) .

here bn is a spatial unit vector, and u is an arbitrary vector with dimension of velocity,

transformation (2.26). the corresponding charge density is time-independent:

with p given by (2.32) and h to be determined. the symplectic structure is as in the free
theory, hence the poisson brackets retain the form (2.24), (2.25). we calculate the poisson
bracket between two hamiltonian densities; in one the elds are evaluated at r, in the other
at r:

(3.26b)

on the other hand, the dirac-schwinger condition for lorentz invariance states that the
bracket (3.26) should give rise to c2 times the momentum density p, which in this problem
is given in (2.19) as

p = p .

(3.27)

rotational invariance requires that the p dependence of h is only on the magnitude p. thus
we conclude that

p2h


2h = c2 .

(3.28)

while many forms for h can solve (3.28), we take a solution that is relevant to the present
context, i.e., it generalizes in a simple manner the free hamiltonian density (2.34), leads to a
theory that descends from the nambu-goto action, and coincides in the nonrelativistic limit
with the galileo-invariant chaplygin gas model:

h =q2c2 + a2qm2c2 + ()2 =q2 + a2/c2

thus an interacting, poincare-invariant theory is described by the lagrangian

=z ddrh  q2c2 + a2qm2c2 + ()2 i .

(3.30)

the corresponding conserved lorentz generator takes the same form as in the rst equality
of (2.41), with h given by (3.29), and it generates the innitesimal transformation

(3.36)

(3.37)

as in the nonrelativistic theory [see (3.16)] the possibility of expressing  in terms of
 requires presence of the interaction, a 6= 0, whose nonvanishing strength disappears
from the nonlinear, interacting equations for . the energy-momentum tensor for the theory
(3.30) is lorentz covariant, of second rank, and symmetric. after eliminating  with (3.35),
the resulting expression, depending solely on , bears the usual relation to its lagrangian
(3.36).

since the interacting lorentz-invariant model is a descendant of the nambu-goto la-
grangian (see section iv), it comes as no surprise that it too possesses additional kinematic
symmetries, whose generators supplement the generators of the linearly realized poincare
group in (d, 1) dimensions to give a nonlinear realization of dynamical poincare algebra in
(d + 1, 1) dimensions [13].

the additional symmetry transformations, which leave (3.30) or (3.36) invariant, involve

a eld-dependent reparametrization of time, dened implicitly by

t  t (t, r) =

t

cosh mc2

+

(t, r)

under which the eld transforms according to

(t, r)  (t, r) =

(3.38)

(3.39)

[we record only the action of the transformations on ; their eect on  can be read o from
(3.35).] the innitesimal generator, which is time independent by virtue of the equation of
motion (3.37), is

d =z ddr(cid:16)m2c4t + q2c2 + a2qm2c2 + ()2(cid:17) =z ddr (m2c4t + h) .

(3.40)

a second class of invariances involves a reparametrization of the spatial variable, implic-

itly dened by

r  r(t, r) = r  b(t, r)
(t, r)  (t, r) =

tan mc

(3.42)

(3.43)

here  is a vectorial parameter, b = /,  = 2. the time-independent generator of

the innitesimal transformation reads

g =z ddr (m2c2r + ) =z ddr (m2c2r + p) .

with the addition of d and g to the previous generators, the poincare algebra in (d+1, 1)
dimension is reconstructed, and the transformation laws (3.38), (3.39), (3.41), (3.42) ensure
that (t, r, ) transforms as a (d+2)-dimensional lorentz vector (in cartesian components) [2].
note that this symmetry also holds in the free, a = 0, theory.

because of the extended symmetry, one can generate new solutions from old ones since

both  and  in (3.39) and (3.42) solve the equation of motion if  does.

a remarkable fact is that the nonrelativistic limit of the above relativistic and interacting
model precisely corresponds to the nonrelativistic interacting model discussed previously.
this is easily seen from (3.30), which in the limit gives (3.1), with the help of (2.43).

equivalently, when  is eliminated, we have from (3.36) and (2.43)

(3.44)

(3.45)

correspondingly, the equation of motion (3.37) goes over into (3.17).

it is easy to exhibit solutions of the relativistic theory, which reduce to solutions of the

nonrelativistic equations that were given previously. the following proles solve (3.37).

(t, r) = mcqc2t2 + r2/(d  1) .

with (2.43), this reduces to (3.18). in one dimension we have

(t, x) = mcqc2t2 + cosh2 kx/k2

reducing to (3.19a). the relativistic analog of the lineal solution (3.22) is

(t, r) = (bn  r) + mu  r  mctqc2 + u2  (bn  u)2 .

(3.46)

(3.47)

(3.48)

note that the above proles continue to solve (3.37), even when the sign of the square root
is reversed; but then they no longer possess a nonrelativistic limit.

additionally, there exists an essentially relativistic, chiral solution describing massless

propagation in one direction:  can satisfy the wave equation

as, for example, with plane waves

where ()2 vanishes. then  reads from (3.35)

iv. relation to nambu-goto action

the nambu-goto action for a d-brane in (d + 1) spatial dimensions, moving in time on
(d + 1, 1) minkowski space is

in-g = z d0d1    ddg

(4.1)

where g is (1)d times the determinant of the induced metric

15

g =

x 


x
 .

(4.2)

here greek letters, from the beginning of the alphabet, label the quantities  = (0, ), with
which the d-brane coordinate x  is parametrized; 0 is the evolution parameter, and  =
{a, a = 1, . . . , d} are the xed-time, spatial parameters. these d-brane coordinates carry a
greek-letter index from the middle of the alphabet, with value 0 for the temporal coordinate
x 0 and m for the d-branes d + 1 spatial coordinates. x = {x m, m = 1, . . . , d, d + 1}.
the action is invariant against reparametrizations of the , and we make the
parametrization choice that the d coordinates x m, m = 1, . . . , d, are given by m, which
we rename rm. for the remaining parameters we use one of two options, light-cone and
cartesian.

in the light-cone option, we dene

x  =

1
2

(x 0  x d+1)

(4.3)

and for x + choose the parametrization x + = 2m 0; also we rename x + as t. the
remaining coordinate x , a function of 0 = t/2m and  = r, is renamed (t, r)/m.
upon evaluating the determinant g, we see that the nambu-goto action coincides with the
action for (3.16) [14]. this identity also explains the higher symmetry noted in eqs. (3.10)
and (3.13). our choice of parametrization does not interfere with invariance against the
(d + 1, 1) poincare group, which acts on x . in the chosen parametrization, the poincare
transformation acts nonlinearly, mixing coordinates (t, r) with the eld . (however, the
higher symmetry is also enjoyed by the noninteracting theory,  = 0, which is not equivalent
to the nambu-goto model.)

for the second, cartesian option the chosen parametrization permits writing x 0, which
is renamed ct, as amc0, while the last coordinate, x d+1, which is a function of 0 = t/am
and  = r, is called (t, r)/mc. with these choices the nambu-goto action coincides with
that for the born-infeld lagrangian, eq. (3.36). again the higher dynamical symmetry,
described by eqs. (3.38)(3.43), is now understood as the covariance of the nambu-goto
variables x  against (d + 1, 1)-dimensional poincare transformations. (but once again, the
similar invariance of the free theory, a = 0, cannot be related to properties of a nambu-goto
action.)

since both the (d, 1)-dimensional galileo-invariant chaplygin gas equations and
the (d, 1)-dimensional poincare-invariant born-infeld equations correspond to dierent
parametrizations of the (d + 1, 1) nambu-goto action, there must be a transformation 
recognized as a reparametrization  that takes solutions of one model into the other. this
transformation may be formulated as follows.

given a solution n r(t, r) to (3.17), we solve for t (t, r) from the equation

1

2(cid:18)t (t, r) +

1

mc2 n r(cid:16)t (t, r), r(cid:17)(cid:19) = t .

then a solution r(t, r) to (3.37), is given by

1

2(cid:18)t (t, r) 

1

mc2 n r(cid:16)t (t, r), r(cid:17)(cid:19) =

1
mc2 r(t, r)

or

16

(4.4)

(4.5a)

r(t, r) = mc2(cid:16)2t (t, r)  t(cid:17) .

(4.5b)

indeed this mapping produces solutions (3.46), (3.47) and (3.48) from (3.18), (3.19a) and
(3.22) respectively. [in fact both signs of the square root are obtained; also (3.48) emerges
from (3.22) only after a redenition of  and u.]

oppositely, given as solution r(t, r) to the relativistic born-infeld equation (3.37), we

reparametrize by solving for t (t, r) from

1

2(cid:18)t (t, r) +

1

mc2 r(cid:16)t (t, r), r(cid:17)(cid:19) = t

and then nd n r(t, r) from

or

1

2(cid:18)t (t, r) 

1

mc2 r(cid:16)t (t, r), r(cid:17)(cid:19) =

1
mc2 n r(t, r)

n r(t, r) = mc2(cid:16)2t (t, r)  t(cid:17) .

the two transformations are collected in the statement

n r(t, r) = mc2(2t  t)
r(t, r) = mc2(2t  t )

(4.6)

(4.7a)

(4.7b)

(4.8)

with the instruction that obtaining an expression for n r in terms of r, or vice-versa,
requires that one of t or t be eliminated in favor of the other.

the interrelationships may be summarized by the following diagram:

it is striking that there exists a two-fold relationship between the chaplygin gas and the
born-infeld model. first, there is the exact mapping, given in (4.8), of one into the other.
second, the nonrelativistic limit (3.44), (3.45) of the latter produces the former.

17

v. one-dimensional motion

in one spatial dimension, the motion of these systems simplies and they become integrable.
we shall give a self-contained demonstration of integrability and derive the integrals of mo-
tion in a compact form, stressing the connection between the relativistic and nonrelativistic
case.

in one dimension the requirement that the local momentum is irrotational poses no
restriction. we shall use as phase space variables the local momentum p(t, x) and the particle
density (t, x). the equal-time poisson bracket (2.25) becomes

{p(x), (x)} = (x  x) .

(5.1)

note that p and  in this relation are on an equal footing and are governed by a nonlocal
canonical 1-form 1
we shall consider local integrals, that is, quantities of the form

2r dx dy (x)(x  y)p(y)dt, where  is the antisymmetric step function.

f =z dxf (p(x), (x))

(5.2)

with f a local function of p and . the poisson bracket of two such integrals f and g is
calculated through (5.1) as

{f, g} = z dxh(fgp + fpg)x + (fpgp + fppg)xpi

(5.3)

where we suppressed the dependence on x and subscripts indicate partial derivative.
if
the above integrand is a total x-derivative then (with appropriate boundary conditions) the
integral will vanish and f and g will be in involution. for this we need the curl-free condition

(fgp + fpg)p = (fpgp + fppg)

or, nally

choosing one of the integrals to be the hamiltonian h =r dxh, the well-known condition

guarantees that f is a constant of the motion. if we recover a set of such integrals satisfying
(5.6) then they will obviously also satisfy (5.5) among themselves. therefore, constants of
motion will automatically be in involution.

for the nonrelativistic case the hamiltonian density (3.2), (3.4) is

h = 

p2
2m

+




and therefore the integrals of motion are generated by functions that satisfy

4f = 2mfpp .

this can readily be solved by separation of variables. we prefer, however, simply to give its
general solution in terms of two arbitrary functions f and g of one variable:

f = f(cid:18)p +

2m



(cid:19) + g(cid:18)p 

2m
 (cid:19) .

(5.9)

we essentially get two innite towers of integrals. choosing, e.g., f (z) = zn, g = 0 or
g(z) = zn, f = 0 we get the integrals

i 

n =z dx (cid:18)p 

2m
 (cid:19)n

(5.10)

all the integrals presented in [5], [16] can be identied as linear combinations of the i 
stated, the i 
the hamiltonian, in particular, is included as 4h = i +
2p = i +

the quantities

r = p 

(5.11)

appearing above are known as riemann coordinates. the equations of motion for this system
(continuity and euler) are summarized in terms of r:

r = 

1
m

r r

 .

(5.12)

although this formulation for the equations is known, the relation to the constants of motion
does not seem to appear in the literature.

another uid system for which the equations of motion, expressed in terms of riemann
coordinates, take a form similar to (5.12) possesses a potential cubic in : v () = 3/3.
this also arises in a collective, semiclassical description of nonrelativistic free fermions, where
the cubic potential reproduces fermion repulsion [17]. in this case, the riemann corrdinates
read

and, in contrast to (5.12), they decouple in the the equations of motion:

2m 

r = p 

r = 

1
m

rr

 .

(5.13)

(5.14)

indeed it is seen that r satisfy essentially the free euler equation [compare (1.2) and
identify r with v]. consequently (5.14) is solved by analogs of (2.2)(2.4).

both these examples are special limiting cases of a more general system, with potential

v () =

3a)

( + 2
( + a)2 + a + b .

(5.15)

(the terms a, b correspond to a dynamically trivial part that does not alter the equations
of motion.) the chaplygin gas corresponds to a = a = b = 0, while the cubic potential is
recovered in the limit

19

 = a4

a = 1

3a2

b =  2

3 a3, a   .

the riemann coordinates are

2m
 + a

r = p 

and the conserved integrals of this system are given by functions of r:

f = ( + a)f(cid:18)p +

2m
 + a (cid:19) + ( + a)g(cid:18)p 

2m
 + a (cid:19) .

(5.16)

(5.17)

(5.18)

the physical meaning of this general system is not clear.

we conclude the discussion on the one-dimensional nonrelativistic chaplygin gas by
presenting a set of moving solutions, which are the galileo boosts of the static solutions
(3.22), (3.23) in section iii. these read

p = p(x  ut) ,  =

2m
|p  mu|

(5.19)

with p(x  ut) an arbitrary function of x  ut (provided it never equals mu). clearly this is
a constant-prole solution moving with a velocity u.

for the relativistic born-infeld system, the hamiltonian density (3.29) is

h =q2c2 + a2qm2c2 + p2 .

relation (5.6) for the conserved integrals reads

m2(2c2 + a2)2f = a2(m2c2 + p2)2fpp .

(5.20)

(5.21)

this can be solved by separation of variables. we prefer again, however, to dene riemann
coordinates and give the solution in terms of arbitrary functions of one variable, just as in
the nonrelativistic case. the relevant combinations here are

r =   p

 = arctan

c
a

p = arctan

p
mc

and the equations of motion read, in terms of these,
r = c(cos r)r



while the general solution to (5.21) is

f =

mca

cos  cos p hf ( + p) + g(  p)i .

(5.22)

(5.23)

(5.24)

by choosing, as before, simple monomials for f and g we get the tower of conserved quantities

i 

n = mcaz dx

(  p)n
cos  cos p

.

(5.25)

the hamiltonian is included as h = i 
0 . the momentum, on the other hand, is an innite
series in the above integrals, requiring f and g to be exponential functions. we can give

20

an alternative tower of complex conserved integrals involving only algebraic functions of p
and :

i 

n =z dxq2c2 + a2

1nqm2c2 + p2

1n

(c  ia)n(p + imc)n .

(5.26)

then the hamiltonian is h = i 
0 while the total momentum, total particle number and
integral of the local momentum are contained in the real and imaginary parts of i +
1 and i 
1
(as well as a trivial constant). it can be checked that the integrals (5.26) go over to the
nonrelativistic ones (5.10) in the limit c   upon proper rescaling.
in the relativistic model  need not be constrained to be positive (negative  could be
interpreted as antiparticle density). the transformation p  p,    is a symmetry
and can be interpreted as charge conjuguation. further, p and  appear in an equivalent
way. as a result, this theory enjoys a duality transformation:

  

a
mc2 p

p  

mc2
a



(5.27)

under the above, both the canonical structure and the hamiltonian remain invariant. solu-
tions are mapped in general to new solutions. note that the nonrelativistic limit is mapped
to the ultra-relativistic one under duality. self-dual solutions  =  a

mc2 p satisfy

 = c

(5.28)

and are, therefore, the chiral relativistic solutions that were presented at the end of sec-
tion iii. in the self-dual case, when p is eliminated from the canonical 1-form and from the
hamiltonian, one arrives at an action for , which coincides (apart from irrelevant constants)
with the self-dual action, constructed some time ago [18]:

2z dx dy (x)(x  y)p(y) dt z dxq2c2 + a2qm2c2 + p2 dt(cid:27)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)p= mc2

a (cid:26) 1
4z dx dy (x)(x  y)(y) dt 

2z dx(cid:16)2(x) +

c

a2

c2(cid:17) dt(cid:27) .

2mc2

=

a 

(5.29)

a set of constant-prole solutions can be found by lorentz-boosting the static solution

(3.48). their most general form is

(5.30)

p = p(x  ut) ,

 =

a
c

up  mcc2  u2
(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)pc2  u2  mcu(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

with p(x  ut), again, a general function. note that the two choices of sign in the above
formula are related by charge conjuguation.
in the extreme relativistic case u  c this
solution goes over to the chiral relativistic solution (3.51). the set of these solutions is
closed under duality transformations.

we shall conclude by presenting an explicit mapping between the relativistic and the
nonrelativistic theories in one dimension, which demonstrates their kinematical equivalence.
note that the relativistic equations of motion (5.23) become, in terms of cos r,

t cos r = c(cos r)x cos r .

(5.31)

21

these are essentially identical to the equations of motion for the nonrelativistic riemann
coordinates (5.12). in fact, putting

r = mc cos r

(5.32)

we see that the r obey the nonrelativistic equations (5.12). expressing r and r in terms
of the corresponding nonrelativistic and relativistic variables produces a mapping between
the two sets. call pn r, n r and pr, r the local momentum and density of the nonrelativistic
and the relativistic theory, respectively. then the mapping is

n r =

2m
am2c2 hr ,

pn r = mc2 rpr
hr

(5.33)

where hr = q2

rc2 + a2qm2c2 + p2

r is the relativistic hamiltonian density. as can be
checked by direct algebra, this maps the relativistic equations of motion to the nonrelativistic
ones. since the combinations of pr and r that appear in (5.33) are duality-invariant, the
mapping of solutions is two-to-one. note that the constant-prole relativistic solutions (5.30)
are mapped to the corresponding nonrelativistic ones (5.19).

we stress that the transformation (5.33) is not canonical, since it does not preserve the
poisson brackets. accordingly, it does not map the relativistic hamiltonian into the nonrel-
ativistic one. this is a manifestation of the bi-hamiltonian structure of these systems, since
there are now two pairs of hamiltonian and canonical structure (the standard nonrelativis-
tic one and the one obtained through this mapping) that lead to the same nonrelativistic
equations of motion.

we note that a similar mapping between the nonrelativistic system and the relativistic
one in light-cone coordinates was presented previously by verosky [19]. the mapping (5.33),
then, can be considered as the analog of veroskys transformation for the lorentz system,
although it cannot be obtained from it in any straightforward way.

the existence of an innite set of constants of motion for both the nonrelativistic chap-
lygin gas, (5.9) and (5.10), as well as for the relativistic born-infeld model, (5.24)(5.26),
signals the complete integrability of these theories. the actual integration of the equations of
motion can be carried out only indirectly. first of all, since both these d = 1 models descend,
via alternate parametrization choices, from the nambu-goto string (1-brane) on the plane
(2-space), the explicit integration of the latter [4] allows presenting solutions of the former
two in terms of two arbitrary functions. alternatively, the chaplygin gas equations can be
combined, after a legendre transformation, into a linear, second-order partial dierential
equation [9], whose general solution, in terms of two arbitrary functions, is known explic-
itly [20]. the born-infeld solution can then be constructed with the help of transformations
described in sections iv and v.

[8] in conventional treatments of relativistic hydrodynamics, as in s. weinberg, gravitation
and cosmology (wiley, new york, 1972),  is a scalar rather than the time-component
of a lorentz vector. this distinction makes no dierence in the noninteracting case, but
our choice allows introducing self-interactions in a lorentz-invariant manner.

[14] this result was established with a hodographic transformation for d = 2 by bordemann
and hoppe (rst paper in ref. [2]) and for arbitrary d by jackiw and polychronakos,
ref. [11]; see also bazeia, ref. [4]. the present, simple approach was shown to us by
hoppe; see also j. hoppe, phys. lett. b329, 10 (1994).
