(13) (14) supercovariant derivative supergravity hand, arbitrary spinor elds evaluated bosonic background obeys equations mo- tion, generic condition linearized supersymmetry invariance. (13), derivatives metric gm n appear combination einstein tensor, due identity (8). like d=11 case, terms cancel. therefore, imposing einstein equations, (13) become (6) (with appropriate energy momentum tensor theory) also satised upon imposing einstein equations; ensuring linearized supersymmetry invariance. information above, generalize theorem. dropping condition background satises einstein equations assuming existence killing spinor, one obtains, following (13), (6) time evaluated killing spinor. condition (iii), implies einstein equations. therefore, replace (i) (i ) background satises einstein equations, together conditions (ii) (iii) , conclusions theorem valid supergravities. let us illustrate theorem may used applications. consider type iib supergravity 10-dimensions . focus metric gm n anti-self dual 5-form eld fm n p qr, set elds zero. eld equations govern dynamics may written as: rm n = 1 96 f p qrs fp qrsn , df = 0, f = f, 5 (15) (16) * usual hodge dual acting dierential forms. killing spinors, bosonic background, satisfy: + 4 480 n p..qm fn p..q = 0, (17) chiral spinor 11 = ; 11 = 0....9, illustrational purposes, sucient write brane-like ansatz metric: 11 = 11, 2 11 = i. ds2 = a(r)2(dt2 + dx2 1 + .. + dx2 3) + b(r)2dr2 + c(r)2d2 5(m), (18) d2 5(m) usual metric s5(m); 5-sphere inverse radius m. note functions a,b c depend radial coordinate r. ricci tensor diagonal entries orthonormal basis ei = adxi, e r = bdr ea = cea, xi = t, x1, .., x3; ea orthonormal basis s5(m). write killing spinor equations, spinors hatted quantities refer orthonormal basis. also use notation that, indices , , , refer coordinates xi, r indices a, b, c, d, e refer coordinates s5(m). 5-form eld may initially chosen constant times volume form s5(m). anti-self duality requires that, also non-zero components along xi r directions. result one may write: f = fabcde = q c 5 , q c 5 abcde, (19) (20) q constant presence function c due fact volume forms (19) (20) determined metric (18). eld equations (16) fm n p qr trivially satised. background properties (i (iii) above. parameter q related electric magnetic charges ) background, identical due anti-self duality condition. hand einstein equations (15) become: 3 1 5 ab!2 ab b ! bc c ab b ! b ! 4 5 c acb2 = q2 4c 10 , = q2 4c 10 , (21) (22) 6 4a2 acb2 denotes derivative respect r. c 2 4 c bc!2 4 c 1 bc c b ! = q2 4c 10 , (23) let us turn killing spinor equations (17). make (5+5) splitting 10-dimensional gamma-matrices : = ( 1), = (i 2), (24) (25) 5-dimensional gamma matrices 1, 2 usual pauli matrices. chirality condition spinors becomes 3 = . killing spinor equations may written explicitly as: + 2b r + qa 8c 5 = 0, r + qb 8c 5 r = 0, (26) (27) ic 2b b e b r + b = 0, iq b 8c 4 e orthonormal basis s5(m).
