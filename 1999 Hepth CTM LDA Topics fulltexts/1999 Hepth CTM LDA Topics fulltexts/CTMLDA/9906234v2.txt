abstract

we generalize the construction of four dimensional non-tachyonic orientifolds of type 0b

string theory to non-supersymmetric backgrounds. we construct a four dimensional model

containing self-dual d3 and d9-branes and leading to a chiral anomaly-free massless spec-

trum. moreover, we discuss a further tachyon-free six dimensional model with only d5

branes. eventually, we speculate about strong coupling dual models of the ten-dimensional

orientifolds of type 0b.

1. introduction

non-supersymmetric string theories have received a lot of attention during the

last year [118]. most of the eort went into a better understanding of phenomena

in the eective non-supersymmetric gauge theories including a new approach to solve

the hierarchy problem by a non-supersymmetric conformal gauge theory in some inter-

mediate energy regime [19]. parallel to that there were some attempts to construct

consistent non-supersymmetric four dimensional string vacua. besides the seven het-

erotic non-supersymmetric ten-dimensional string theories there also exist the two non-

supersymmetric type 0a/b string theories [20]. the latter models both contain a tachy-

onic mode which renders the theory unstable. one way to circumvent this problem is by

placing enough rr ux in the background which shifts the square of the tachyon mass

to positive values. this approach was used in [1] to reliably study the eective theory on

the d3 branes. another way of getting rid of the tachyon is by doing a special orientifold

[21,22,23].

there exist three independent orientifold projections of type 0b string theory
{, (1)fr, (1)fr}, where (1)fr is the right moving space-time fermion number
and (1)fr is the right moving world-sheet fermion number. the rst two models still

contain a bulk tachyon, whereas in the third, the type 0, model the tachyon is projected

out. the massless spectrum of the resulting ten-dimensional non-supersymmetric string

theory contains the graviton, the dilaton, a rr 0-form, a 2-form and a self-dual 4-form in

the closed string sector and a gauge eld in the adjoint of u(32) equipped by a left-handed

majorana-weyl fermion in the 496  496 representation in the open string sector. the

latter fermions necessarily appear for this class of orientifolds, because the world-sheet
fermion number operator (1)fr exchanges a d9 brane charged under the rst of the two

rr 10-forms in type 0b with a d9 brane charged under the second of the two rr 10-

forms. open strings stretched between these dierent kinds of 9-branes lead to space-time

fermions.

as was pointed out in [24,11] requiring the absence of tachyons also for compact-

ied type 0 orientifolds is highly restrictive and so far only one zz2 orientifold in six-
dimensions and one zz3 orientifold in four dimensions have been constructed. in all other
cases there appear extra tachyons in twisted sectors which can not all be projected out as
long as  exchanges a g-twisted sector with a g1 twisted sector. one can allow  to act

without exchanging twisted sectors but as was argued in [25] such models contain extra

non-perturbative states.

1

all compact models studied so far were supersymmetric backgrounds in the sense that
when used in a type iib compactication they preserve some supersymmetry. however,

since type 0b is non-supersymmetric anyway, one might try to consider backgrounds not
preserving any supersymmetry at all. in this case the absence of tachyons is highly re-
strictive, as well, but in the rst part of this letter in some detail we will present one
it turns out that in order to
specic zz2 model in which everything works out nicely.
cancel all rr tadpoles one has to introduce d9/d9 and d3/d3 branes. of course, as in

all type 0 orientifolds there remains an uncancelled dilaton tadpole which can be cured
by the fischler/susskind mechanism [26]. in the second part of this paper we will discuss

one more compact model in six dimensions followed by some speculations about possible
dual models of the ten-dimensional type 0b orientifolds.

2. type 0 orientifold on a non-supersymmetric background

we take type 0b string theory, compactify it on a six torus t 6 = (s1)6 and divide out
by the orientifold group {(1 + r) + (1 + r)} with  = (1)fr and r : zi  zi for all
i  {1, 2, 3}. note, that in a type iib compactication r would not satisfy level-matching
in the ns-r and r-ns sector. however, precisely these two sectors are absent in type 0b
string theory so that dividing out by r leads to a modular invariant torus amplitude.

already at this stage we would like to point out that there exists a subtlety in the ramond
sector which will become important in the open string sector. since the action of r on the

left-moving ramond sector ground states is given by

r|s1 s2 s3 s4i = ei(s2+s3+s4)|s1 s2 s3 s4i = i|s1 s2 s3 s4i

with si = 

1
2

,

(2.1)

it acts rather like a zz4 than a zz2 operation. of course in the closed string sector the
left-moving ramond sector is always paired with the right-moving ramond sector, so that
here r really acts like a zz2. as usual in orientifolds one has to compute all one-loop
diagrams and require tadpole cancellation.

2.1. the klein bottle amplitude

2.2. the annulus amplitude

in order to cancel these rr tadpoles we introduce n9 pairs of d9/d9 branes and n3
pairs of d3/d3 branes. note, that in a type i compactication this would be impossible,

as in contrast to type 0 string theory type i string theory simply does not contain any

d3-branes. since open strings stretched between a dp and dp brane have fermionic zero

modes, we are facing the subtlety mentioned in (2.1). the action of r on the modes leads

to extra factors of i which must be compensated by further factors of i from the action

of r on the chan-paton factors of the open strings. thus, in the open string sector we

better consider r as a zz4 action, so that the annulus amplitude is

(2.3)

where the trace has to be taken over all open strings stretched between the four dierent

kinds of d-branes {d9, d9, d3, d3}. the presentation of the whole amplitude would be

much too lengthy to present here. however, completely analogous to the model discussed

in [27], cancellation of the twisted rr tadpoles requires

tr(r,p) = 0

with p  {9, 9, 3, 3}.

(2.4)

neglecting all the terms becoming zero by the choice in (2.4), for instance in the 99, 99,

99 and 99 sectors the total annulus amplitude reads

(2.5)

for open strings stretched between d3/d3 branes the result is completely analogous. if

we would simply choose tr(r2,9) = tr(r2,9) = 0 then only the rst term in (2.5) would
be non-zero. however, since we have introduced in (2.3) an extra factor of two in the

denominator compared to a usual zz2 annulus amplitude, we would get a problem with
tadpole cancellation. we can cure this missing factor of two by requiring that the second

and third term in (2.5) add up exactly to the rst term leading to

tr(r2,9)tr( 1
tr(r2,9)tr( 1

we have to take into account that  acts on the ground states in the 99 and 33 sector in

the following way

|s1 s2 s3 s4i33 = ei(s2+s3+s4)|s1 s2 s3 s4i33.

(2.10)

for the 99 sector there are non-zero contributions from the  and r2 insertions in the

trace. with the choice of the r matrix above one gets

one derives the following two rr tadpole cancellation conditions

2.5. the massless spectrum

having dened all the actions of the r and  on the various modes and on the chan-

paton factors it is now a straightforward exercise to compute the massless spectrum as

displayed for the closed string sector in table 1.

string spectrum listed in table 2.

note, that the chiral massless spectrum in table 2 passes the non-trivial check of absence of

non-abelian gauge anomalies. similar to the supersymmetric case we expect the anomalous

u(1)s to be cancelled by some generalized green-schwarz mechanism [28].

3. type 0 orientifold in 6d with d5-branes

we now discuss the possibility of constructing type 0 orientifolds using certain sym-

metry properties of the compactied manifolds. in particular, orientifolds of type iib on

k3 have been constructed previously [29,30] and give rise to anomaly free models in six

dimensions with dierent number of tensor, vector and hyper-multiplets. it is also known

that k3 possesses certain discrete isometries which can be combined with orientifold pro-

jections. since these isometries maintain supersymmetry, one is able to obtain consistent

models without breaking supersymmetry further. such projections have also been utilized

6

earlier for constructing type ii examples of string models which are dual to the reduced

rank heterotic string compactications with maximal supersymmetry [31].

we now show that such projections can also be applied to construct consistent type 0

orientifolds. as an explicit example we concentrate on a particular zz2 isometry of k3 which

leaves all three self-dual 2-forms of k3 invariant. however among the 19 anti-self-dual 2-

forms 8 are odd under its operation. we work with a particular realization of this projection

in the orbifold limit t 4/zz2 of k3 [29]. the orbifold is constructed by complex coordinates
(z1, z2) on the torus t 4 dened by periodic identications: z1  z1 + 1, z1  z1 + i

(similarly for z2) and by dividing the torus by zz2  {1, r}, where the projection r acts

on complex coordinates as, r : (z1, z2)  (z1, z2). on the other hand the isometry of
k3 mentioned above is represented by an operation s : (z1, z2)  (z1 + 1

2 , z2 + 1

2 ).

the orientifold model that we are considering involves the projections r and s.

the closed string spectrum in the untwisted ns-ns sector then consists of the graviton,

dilaton and 10 scalars denoted by the representations [(3, 3) + 11(1, 1)] of su (2)  su (2),

which is the little group of the lorentz group in six dimensions. the untwisted r-r sector

consists of 4 self-dual and 4 anti-self-dual 2-forms, in addition to 8 scalars, represented as:

[4(3, 1) +4(1, 3) +8(1, 1)]. the twisted ns-ns sectors contribute 64 scalars and the twisted

r-r sectors contribute states: [8(3, 1) + 8(1, 3) + 16(1, 1)].

as a result the total closed string spectrum consists of graviton, dilaton, 98 scalars

and 12 self-dual as well as 12 anti-self-dual 2-forms. the model is free of gravitational

anomaly, as the self-dual and anti-self-dual 2-forms come in equal numbers.

to obtain the open string spectrum, one analyses the tadpole cancellation conditions.

twisted rr tadpoles are once again cancelled by choosing r traceless for both 9 and

5-branes. since the action of s includes shifts along coordinates x6 and x8, the model is

also free of the massless rr 10-form tadpoles in the untwisted sector. as a result, apart

from uncancelled ns-ns tadpoles, one only has rr 6-form tadpoles which are cancelled

by adding only 32 d5 and 32 d5-branes in two possible ways:

(i) 16 5-branes and 16 5-branes at a xed point y of r and the same numbers of them

at the image of y under s. the chan-paton indices are determined by a 32  32

block-diagonal matrix r = diag[m, m ] with m a 16  16 matrix: m = diag[i8, i8].

the resulting open string spectrum is listed in table 3.

table 3: open string spectrum of t 4/zz2

since there are equal number of left and right-handed fermions, the model is anomaly

free.

(ii) alternatively, one can take 16 5-branes (as well as 16 5-branes) to lie at a xed point

x of s and the remaining ones at the image of x under r. in this case the gauge group

is u(16). to compare, for a similar iib model the gauge group was so(16) [29] and

the dierence comes due to the form of s. in our case s is a 32  32 matrix with

identities (i16) along the o-diagonal blocks, so as to mix the 5 and 5-branes under

. in this case, one obtains the massless spectrum shown in table 4.

the model is once again anomaly free.

in this section we have presented one tachyon free six dimensional type 0 orientifold using

a discrete isometry of k3. as mentioned earlier, k3 has several other discrete isometries,

knows as nite abelian automorphism groups. one can use these isometries as projection

elements to construct other models as well. one can also use certain supersymmetry non-

preserving involution of k3, known as enrique involution, to construct a type 0 model.

however it turns out that the klein-bottle amplitude is free of tadpoles and hence there

is no need to add any d-branes. the model is found to be purely bosonic in the closed

string sector.

4. a duality conjecture

in [12] a very intriguing conjecture about the strong coupling limit of type 0a was

presented, namely that type 0a string theory at strong coupling is m-theory compactied
on s1/(1)fss, where s denotes the half-shift along the compact circle. so far no dual

candidate has been conjectured for the type 0 orientifold. in [23] arguments were given that

the type 0 orientifold with gauge group so(32)so(32) might be dual to the bosonic string

compactied on an so(32) torus. in the following we would like to propose a dual model
for the type 0 orientifold with gauge group (so(16)so(16))2, which also contains space-
time fermions1. analogous to the discussion in [32], consider m-theory compactied to nine
dimensions on s1/zz2  s1/(1)fss, where the rst zz2 is the reection i1 : x10  x10
combined with the change of the sign of the three-form. compactifying rst x10 and then
x9 one arrives at the e8  e8 heterotic string compactied on s1/(1)fss. as argued in
[33], after applying t-duality for r9  0 this should be the ten-dimensional non-tachyonic

so(16) so(16) heterotic string. exchanging the role of x10 and x9 one arrives at type

0a/ i1, which is supposed to be t-dual to type 0b/. taking this chain of dualities

seriously, one is led to the following strong-weak duality conjecture:

type 0 orientifold dual

 non-susy so(16) so(16) heterotic string.

at rst glance this seems to make no sense, as the gauge group of the type 0 orientifold

has rank equal to 32. however, as was noticed in [12,34], at strong coupling the pair of a

dp and a dp brane might form a bound state in which half of the zero modes at weak

coupling are frozen. by t-duality this implies that also the rank of the gauge group get

reduced by a factor of two at strong coupling. therefore, we think the conjecture not

necessarily is nonsence and it deserves a more detailed investigation about the actual sense

in which the duality relation should be understood. in view of the duality above, it is very

tempting to make the following conjecture for the type 0 orientifold:

type 0 orientifold dual

 non-susy u(16) heterotic string.

the u(16) heterotic model has a tachyon which makes the whole picture somehow symmet-

ric. in the former dual pair the heterotic model encounters a tachyonic instability at strong

coupling whereas in the latter dual pair it is the orientifold model which has a tachyonic

gests that all these models are dynamically driven to their supersymmetric counterparts.
