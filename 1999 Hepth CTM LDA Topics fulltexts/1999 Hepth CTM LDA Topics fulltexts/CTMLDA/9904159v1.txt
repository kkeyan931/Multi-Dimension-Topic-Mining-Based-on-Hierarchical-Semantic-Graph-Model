abstract

in this work we consider an abelian chern-simons-higgs model coupled
non-minimally to matter elds. this coupling is implemented by means of a
pauli-type coupling. we show that the pauli term is sucient to gives rise to
fractional spin.

the fractional statistics [1] with its theoretical and applicable consequences plays an
interesting interplay role between quantum eld theory and condensed matter physics. pre-
vious speculations [2] that the fractional quantum hall eect could be explained by quasi-
particles (anyons) obeying fractional statistics were conrmed both numerically and ana-
lytically [3]. so far not so successfully, anyons are also studied in the context of high tc
superconductivity [4].

as it is known, the presence of chern-simons terms in (2+1) dimensional gauge theories
induce fractional statistics [5,6]. however, besides the statistical interaction, anyons may
interact electro-magnetically [7]. to describe the fractional quantum hall eect, a bound
state of anyon and a magnetic ux tube is required [8], which means that the interaction
between the electric charge and the magnetic moment of the anyon must be considered.

chern-simons-like theories involving an anomalous magnetic moment have attracted
much attention in the literature in recent years. stern [9] was the rst, as far as we know,
to suggest a nonminimal term in the context of the maxwell-chern-simons electrodynamics
with the intention of mimicking an anyonic behavior without a pure chern-simons limit.
this term can be interpreted as a tree level pauli-type coupling, i. e., an anomalous magnetic
moment. it is a specic feature of (2+1) dimensions that the pauli coupling exists, not only
for spinning particles, but also for scalar ones [10]. as a fundamental result stern showed
that, for a particular value of the nonminimal coupling constant, the eld equations of his
model coincide with the eld equations of a pure chern-simons theory minimally coupled.

in this letter, we consider an abelian chern-simons-higgs theory where the complex
scalar elds couples directly to the electromagnetic eld strength (pauli-type coupling). we
quantize canonically the theory using the dirac brackets method and compute the angular
momentum operator with the contribution of the pauli term. finally, we show that this
term gives rise to fractional spin even in the absence of chern-simons term.

the lagrangian of the model under investigation is

l = ||2 +

where   (  iea  i g
4 f ). note that this covariant derivative includes both
the usual minimal coupling and the contribution due to paulis term. here a is the gauge
eld and the levi-civita symbol  is xed by 012 = 1 and g = diag(1,1,1). the
multiplier eld b has been introduced to implement the covariant gauge-xing condition.
before quantizing the theory, we analyze the above lagrangian in terms of hamiltonian
methods. here we follow the approach used by shin et al. [11]. we carry out the constraint
analysis of this model, in order to obtain a consistent formulation of the theory.

the canonical momenta of the lagrangian (1), which can be easily seen by considering

its temporal and spatial components separately, are given by

0 = 0 ,

b = a0 ,

where 0, j, b ,  and  are the canonical momenta conjugate to a0, aj, b,  and 
respectively. also we have used ij = 0ij , di = i  ieai and i, j = 1, 2 .
the canonical momenta (2) and (3) do not involve explicit time dependence and hence are
primary constraints. performing the legendre transformation, the canonical hamiltonian
can be written as

hc =  + |d|2 + iea0(  ) + ija0iaj + aiib

now, in order to implement the primary constraints in the theory, we construct the

primary hamiltonian as

2

hp = hc + 0 + 1(b + a0) ,

(8)

where 0 and 1 are lagrange multiplier elds. conserving in time the primary constraints
yields the secondary constraints

1 = 0  0 ,

2 = b + a0  0 ,

which are also conserved in time and where the symbol  indicates weak equality, i. e., the
constraints can be identically set equal to zero only after computing the relevant poisson
brackets. thus there is no more constraint and the above equations are the set of fully
second-class constraints. on the other hand, there is no rst-class conditions and so, no
gauge conditions to be determined in theory. this is an eect of the gauge xing condition
imposed previously. as it is known, the lack of physical signicance allows that the second-
class constraints can be eliminated by means of dirac brackets (dbs).

following the standard dirac brackets formalism and quantizing the system, we obtain

the following set of non-vanishing equal-time commutators:

[a0(x), b(y)] = i2(x  y)

[ai(x), j(y)] = iij2(x  y)

[(x), (y)] = [(x), (y)] = i2(x  y)

(11)

(12)

(13)

after achieving the quantization we proceed to construct the angular momentum oper-

ator and compute the angular momentum of the matter eld .

the symmetric energy-momentum tensor can be obtained by coupling the elds to gravity

and then varying the action with respect to g:

t =

g = ()() + ()()  a b  a b

g(||2  ab) .

the angular momentum operator in (2+1) dimensions is given by

l = z d2xijxit0j .

hence

the key point here is that gauss law is no more a constraint, while j0 and t contain
derivatives of a . note that, due to its topological character, the chern-simons term
does not contribute to the energy-momentum tensor. these aspects are attributed to the
non-linearity introduced by paulis term.

the rotational property of the  eld is obtained by computing the commutator [l, (y)].

using equations (11-13) and (15), it is easy to see that

[l, (y)] = ijyij   [ez d2xijxiajj0, ] + i

g

this commutator can be rewritten by means of the electromagnetic charge operator

(19)

the rst term in the right hand side of eq. (19) represents the intrinsic spin and the
second is the so-called rotational anomaly, which is responsible for the fractional spin. the
term that involves the electric eld is the central point of this work. unlike the chern-
simons term (whose contribution is related with magnetic eld), the pauli term induces an
anomalous contribution for the spin of the system, which depends on electric eld. we stress
that, here the nonminimal coupling constant is a free parameter.

it is worth mentioning that all the procedure above can be carried out even if there is no
chern-simons term in the lagrangian (1). in this case the anomalous contribution to spin
would just come from the pauli term.

now we will discuss the above result in connection with theories in the broken-symmetry
phase. boyanovsky [12] has found that the low-lying excitations of a u(1) chern-simons
theory in interaction with a complex scalar eld in a broken symmetry state are massive
bosons with canonical statistics. he explained his result as due to the screening of long-range
forces in a broken symmetry phase. in this phase localized charge distributions cannot be
supported, which is supposed to be essential for fractional spin. on the other hand, if we
consider a non-minimally coupled abelian-higgs model, the long-distance damping eect by
the photon mass  no longer exists. this is an indication that paulis term, which induces
an anomalous spin, can be relevant for the study of broken symmetry states (superuid) in
the context of eective theories in condensed matter.

we conclude with two comments:

4

a) in nonrelativistic limit, carrington and kunstatter [13] have shown that anomalous
magnetic moment interactions gives rise to both the aharonov-bohm and aharonov-casher
eects. they have speculated possible anomalous statistics without the cs term. as a
matter of fact, we believe that this (in a relativistic theory) was proved here.

b) the abelian chern-simons term can be generated by means of a spontaneous sym-
metry breaking of a nonminimal theory [14,13]. this connection between chern-simons
and pauli-type coupling was pointed out by stern [9]. so the pauli term at tree-level (with
the nonminimal coupling constant g as a free parameter) can constitute an eective theory
which bring us information about physical models in broken symmetry phase.
