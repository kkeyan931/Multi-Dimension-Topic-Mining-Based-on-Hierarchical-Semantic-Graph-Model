abstract

the vacuum energy of a scalar eld in a spherically symmetric back-
ground eld is considered. based on previous work [phys. rev. d 53
(1996) 5753], the numerical procedure is rened further and applied to
several examples. we provide numerical evidence that repulsive potentials
lead to positive contributions to the vacuum energy. furthermore, the
crucial role played by bound-states is clearly seen.

1 introduction

the calculation of vacuum energies in the context of quantum eld theory under
external conditions plays an important role in several areas of modern theoret-
ical physics. external conditions present may be classical elds (for example
gravitational [1] and electromagnetic elds, monopoles [2, 3], sphalerons [4] or
electroweak skyrmions [5]), or they may be realized through boundaries at which
the quantum eld has to satisfy certain boundary conditions (see for example

[6]). external elds most naturally appear as classical solutions of some physical
nonlinear equations, but they may also be viewed as a localized property of space
representing a distribution of matter within which the quantum eld exists. for
external elds realized as boundaries this situation is usually called casimir ef-
fect. there is a number of generalizations towards weakened boundaries, e.g.,
by introducing semi hard walls [7] or transparent boundaries realized by delta
functions [8]. for actual interest in such calculations see, e.g., [9, 10].

a formalism how to deal with arbitrary background elds, which we use here,
has been developed in [11] for a background depending on one cartesian coordi-
nate and in [12] for a general spherically symmetric background. however, these
methods had been applied to a square well potential only where the interesting
quantities can be expressed in terms of bessel functions.

the aim of the present work is to show that this formalism is well suited for
arbitrarily shaped spherically symmetric background elds. we investigate in
detail dierent types of background elds as examples. it is observed that the
main feature of the vacuum energy is determined by the number (and depth) of
bound states. as long as these are kept xed the general behavior of its energy
when varying parameters is the same within the class of examples considered. at
the same time we nd that the presence of bound states does not x the sign of
the ground state energy.

similar calculations, however with a less extend of details and using other

techniques, have been performed earlier, e.g., in [13] and [14].

the paper is organized as follows. in the next section the basic notations of
the method used are explained. in the third section the asymptotic contribu-
tion is calculated. in the fourth section the numerical procedure is developed in
detail followed by a section containing the examples calculated. the results are
discussed in the conclusions.

2 the model, its renormalization and some ba-

sic results

we consider the theory described by the lagrangian

l =

1
2

(  m 2  2) +

1
2

(  m2  2).

here the eld  is a classical background eld. by means of

v (x) = 2

(1)

(2)

it denes the potential in (1) for the eld (x), which should be quantized in the
background of v (x).

2

our interest is in the vacuum energy of the theory which is dened as half

the sum of the one particle energies of the eld (x)

e[] =

1

2x(n)

(2

(n) + m2)1/2s2s .

(3)

here s is the regularization parameter with s  0 in the end and  is an arbitrary
mass parameter. the 2
(n) are the one-particle energy eigenvalues determined
through

( + v (x))(n)(x) = 2

(n)(n)(x).

(4)

for the moment a nite volume is assumed to have discrete eigenvalues.

the spectral function appearing in eq. (3) is related to the zeta function of

the wave operator (4),

v (s) =x(n)

(2

(n) + m2)s ,

by

e[] =

1
2

v (s  1/2)2s.

(5)

(6)

the ultraviolet divergences contained in the ground state energy (3) needs to be
renormalized. the divergences are known and best expressed in terms of the heat
kernel coecients related to the operator dened in eq. (4). then the divergent
part of the ground state energy reads

will be dropped from here on without further comment.

the renormalization procedure is set by the denition

and the corresponding counter terms can be absorbed into a redenition of the
parameters m 2 and  of the classical background eld whose energy reads

it might be useful to note that among the divergent contributions (7) to the
ground state energy there are no terms proportional to the kinetic part in the
lagrangian of the background (x). within the given framework this is a simple
consequence of the structure of the heat kernel coecients. sometimes for the
divergent part of the ground state energy the rst 2 terms of the perturbative
expansion of e0[] with respect to powers of the background eld  is taken
(e.g., in [14]). this has the disadvantage of containing nonlocal contributions (in
opposite to the heat kernel expansion expansion which is local) and invites to
discuss the kinetic term among the divergent ones which is in fact unnecessary.
as the renormalization procedure is not unique, a normalization condition

must be imposed. we require

lim
m

eren

 [] = 0 .

(10)

for a massive eld this is the natural condition requiring the energy of the quan-
tum uctuation to vanish for the eld becoming heavy. as discussed in [15] this
delivers a unique denition of the ground state energy (in opposite to the case of
a massless eld, see the discussion in [15] and also in [16]).

to proceed we follow [12] and use the representation of the regularized ground
state energy in terms of the jost function fl(k) of the scattering problem corre-
sponding to (4)

(11)

we remind the denition of the so-called regular solution n,l(r) of the radial
wave equation (see, e.g., [17])

(cid:20) d2
dr2 

l(l + 1)

r2  v (r) + k2(cid:21) n,l(r) = 0 .

(12)

it is the solution, which for r  0 behaves as the free (i.e., without potential)
solution. the jost function (and its complex conjugate) are dened as the coef-
cients in the asymptotic expansion of this solution as r  :

(13)

where h

l (pr) and h+

l (pr) are the riccati-hankel functions.

instead of dealing explicitly with eigenvalues, the vacuum energy is expressed
in terms of the jost function. although representation (11) does not reveal explic-
itly the dependence of the energy on the bound states, in [12] it was shown that
their contribution is correctly included. this, and the non oscillating behavior of

4

the jost function on the imaginary axis (cf. (11)) gives this representation cal-
culational advantages with respect to alternative representation (e.g. integrating
the scattering phases over the real k-axis).

to proceed we have to perform the analytic continuation in s to s = 0 in
representation (8) of eren
 using (11) for e[]. although we known that the
result is nite, this task requires some work. the point is that one cannot put
s = 0 under the sign of the sum and the integral in (11) being inserted into eq.
(8). the reason is the lack of convergence for k and l large. therefor we use the
uniform asymptotic expansion ln f asym
(ik) of the logarithm of the jost function
for both, k and l large. we subtract and add it to the integrand. as a result we
get the sum of two parts

the rst contribution, ef [] is called the nite part. there the regularization

determined below. the asymptotic expansion ln f asym

4 numerical determination of the jost function

and the integration procedure

under the assumption that the potential has compact support, lets say v (r) = 0
for r  r, the regular solution may be written as
l (pr)  f 

l,p(r) = ul,p(r)(r  r) +

l (p)h+

(21)

i

l (pr)i (r  r).

2hfl(p)h

this solution and its derivative must be continuous at r = r. so the matching
conditions are

ul,p(r) =

u
l,p(r) =

l (p)h+

i

2hfl(p)h
phfl(p)h

i
2

l (pr)  f 
l (pr)  f 

l (pr)i ,
l (pr)i .

l (p)h+

from these conditions we get the jost function in terms of the regular solutions,

fl(p) = 

1

p(cid:16)pul,p(r)h+

l (pr)  u

l,p(r)h+

l (pr)(cid:17) ,

where we used that the wronskian determinant of h
l

is 2i.

(22)

the assumption of the potential v (r) having a nite support is natural within
the framework of a numerical calculation. anyway the potential is assumed to
vanish for r  . so, after some value of the radius it can be viewed as zero
within the required precision. this simplies the numerical procedure consider-
ably. another situation would occur for a coulomb like potential which we do
not consider in this paper.

in order to determine a unique solution of the dierential equation (12), we
need to pose the initial value problem corresponding to l,p(r) being the regular
solution. we have for r  0

l,p(r) = ul,p(r)  jl(pr) 

we change to the new function


(l + 3/2)(cid:16)z

2(cid:17)l+1

.

ul,p(r) =


(l + 3/2)(cid:16)pr

2 (cid:17)l+1

gl,p(r)

with the initial value gl,p(0) = 1. the dierential equation for gl,p(r) reads

(cid:26) d2
dr2 + 2

l + 1

r

d

dr  v (r) + p2(cid:27) gl,p(r) = 0,

or, going to the imaginary p-axis and writing it as a rst order dierential equation
with (/r)gl,ip(r) = vl,ip(r),

d

dr(cid:18) gl,ip(r)

vl,ip(r) (cid:19) =(cid:18)

0

v (r) + p2  2

1

r (l + 1) (cid:19)(cid:18) gl,ip(r)

vl,ip(r) (cid:19) .

(23)

to x the solution uniquely we only need to x vl,ip(0). a power series ansatz
for gl,ip(r) about r = 0 shows that for v (r) = o(r1+) the condition reads
vl,ip(0) = 0. with this unique solution of (23), the jost function takes the form

fl(ip) =

2

(l + 3/2)(cid:18) pr

l,ip(r)kl+1/2(pr)(cid:27) .(24)

finally, doing a partial integration and the substitution q = k2  m2 in eq.

(16), the starting point for the numerical evaluation used for ef is

ef =

(25)

where ln f asym

is given by eq. (17).

5 examples

the method described above works for radially symmetric potentials (r) having
compact support (r  r) = 0. in order to have a nite classical energy (eq. 9)
we also demand (r = 0) = (r = r) = 0.

in the following we use dimensionless quantities

 = er,
 = mr,

 =

r
r

,

(26)

v (r) = 2(r)

=

1
r2 v() =


r2 2()

such that  = [, ]. therefore, large  corresponds to large r and to large m,
respectively.

we studied two types of potentials. type a is lump-like concentrated around

r = 0 whereas type b has its maximum at r/2, acting like a spherical wall:

a() =

b() =

a(1  2)2
,
a + 2
16a2(1  )2
a + (1  2)2 .

(27)

the parameter a allows to vary the shape of the potentials, as indicated in the
insets of the gures.

our numerical implementation of eq. (25) showed that the sum over angular
momenta converges quite fast, usually after 1050 terms. hereby, the numerical
q-integration procedure has to solve the system of ordinary dierential equations
eq. (23) for every evaluation of the jost function fl(ip).

as a check, we compared our results with the asymptotic formulae

where a2 = 1

from scaling arguments together with the well known property of the heat kernel
expansion being the asymptotic expansion for large mass.

2r d~xv (r)2 is the second heat kernel coecient and
2 v (r)v (r)  v (r)3(cid:1)) is the third one. these relations follow

6r d~x(cid:0) 1

the most determining property of the potential v (r) in the attractive case
 < 0 is the number and depth of bound states. the parameter dependence of
the l = 0 bound states, determined as zeroes of the l = 0 jost function, eq. (24),
is shown in gs. 1 and 2. number as well as depth of the bound states increases
with increasing || and with increasing a, too.
as eq. (25) shows, the casimir energy develops an imaginary part (corre-
sponding to particle creation by the external eld) when the q-integration passes
a zero of the jost function. ef is real as long as  is larger than the depth of
the highest bound state. therefore we indicate in our gures 36 the positions of
bound states on the  axis by vertical lines where the plots of the casimir energy
end.

to show clearly the inuence of the form and spectrum of v on the vacuum
energy, we consider the dependence of the energy for xed  and dierent values
of the parameter a, gs. 3 and 4, as well as for xed shape a and dierent depths 
in gs. 5 and 6.

these gures demonstrate that the vacuum energy is determined by two com-
peting contributions, the positive contribution of the scattering states and the
negative contribution of the bound states of the potential.

let us start with a description and interpretation of gs. 3 and 4. for a large,
the contribution of the bound state(s) to the vacuum energy is large enough
to overcompensate the contribution of the scattering states and the energy is
negative. at some critical value of a, the energy of the only remaining bound
state is so small that the positive contributions of the scattering states get the
upper hand, and the vacuum energy is positive. finally, for a  0 we have
normalized eren
starts to decrease
again with decreasing a.

 [ = 0] = 0, such that at some point eren



the same features are clearly recovered in gs. 5 and 6. for large enough
() a negative vacuum energy energy is obtained. with decreasing () the
energy increases and can be positive or negative depending on the parameter .
again, at some point the scattering states dominate, the energy gets positive and
tends to zero as  tends to zero. for positive  the energy starts to increase
again, being virtually identical for the two values  = 2, and it seems that eren
is a monotonically increasing function of  for   0. since we see no qualitative
dierence between our two potential types a and b, we expect these features to
be universal.



given that the dependence of the energy on  is somewhat nontrivial, let us

show this dependence explicitely for type a potentials in g. 7.

as long as no bound states exist, the sign of  is not important and the
energy is nearly symmetric about  = 0. the contribution to the energy of

9

the scattering states does not depend much on the sign of . the symmetry
is disturbed as soon as a bound state shows up and the energy then decreases
with decreasing  because the bound state depth as well as the number of bound
states increases.

conclusions

we demonstrated that our method is quite feasible for calculations of the casimir
energy in realistic 3-dimensional examples for arbitrary spherical symmetric ex-
ternal potentials as long as they are smooth and have compact support.

the behavior of the casimir energy shows some interesting features. the
existence of bound states is a necessary but by no means sucient condition for
a negative vacuum energy. even in the presence of bound states the sign of the
energy can depend on the scale parameter , i.e the mass of the quantum eld
measured in units of the size r of the potential.

for shallow potentials without bound states (small ||) the casimir energy
is nearly invariant under a change of the sign of the potential whereas for deep
attractive potentials the negative contribution of the bound states dominates the
vacuum energy.

on the other hand we found no qualitative dierences between a lump-like

and a ring-like classical background conguration.

the method developed here can be used for the calculation of quantum cor-

rections to classical objects like skyrmions and others.
