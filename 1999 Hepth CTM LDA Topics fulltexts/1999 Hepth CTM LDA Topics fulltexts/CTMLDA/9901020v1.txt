abstract

we calculate f 4 and r4t 4g4 couplings in d = 8 heterotic and type i string vacua
(with gauge and graviphoton eld strengths f, t , and riemann curvature r). the holo-
morphic piece fg of the heterotic oneloop coupling r4t 4g4 is given by a polylogarithm
of index 5  4g and encodes the counting of genus g curves with g nodes on the k3 of
the dual f theory side. we present closed expressions for worldsheet  integrals with an

arbitrary number of lattice vector insertions. furthermore we verify that the correspond-

ing heterotic oneloop couplings sum up perturbative open string and non-perturbative

dstring contributions on the type i side. finally we discuss a type i oneloop correction
to the r2 term.

1. introduction

heterotic so(32)/type i duality relates two string theories in ten dimensions [1][2].

a eld redenition transforms the low energy eective action of the heterotic string into

the one of the type i string. this duality map is valid for second derivative terms as well

as for higher derivative terms containing four or eight derivatives that can be arranged

into superinvariants [3]. the low energy eective actions of the heterotic and type i string

theory are related by the following eld redenitions in d = 10 [2][3]:

gi

i =

(1.1)

where a = 1, . . . , 16 labels so(32) gauge indices, g is the metric and bns/r
metric tensor in the n s or r sector and i = e(10)
compactifying to lower dimensions modies these relations due to the dependence on the

(1.2)

where gi is the internal metric in the type i string frame. this relation shows that

the critical dimension d = 6 separates a strongweak coupling duality from a weakweak

coupling duality.

toroidal compactication down to eight dimensions gives rise to 4 abelian gauge

elds, corresponding to components of gi and bi , where  is the space-time index and

i labels the compact directions. the four massless scalar elds from gij and bij combine
o(2)o(2) of the torus t 2
into two complex scalars t, u and parametrize the moduli space
(if no wilson lines are switched on). in the type i theory the u (1)2  u (1)2 gauge group
is reduced to a diagonal u (1)2, due to the twist operator  [5]. similarly only two of the

o(2,2)

four massless scalar elds survive the projection.

besides a comparison of the bps spectrum of the heterotic and type i string non
trivial checks can be done for the bpssaturated f 4 and r4 couplings; see e.g. [6][7][8][9]

and [10][11] for gauge couplings in the context of heterotic/f-theory duality. the special

feature of these couplings is that on the heterotic side they are protected from higher

than oneloop corrections in the eective action because of supersymmetry. thus they

can be exactly calculated. these threshold corrections translate to perturbative open

string amplitudes and non-perturbative bps d1-instanton corrections on the type i side.

therefore by studying various examples of couplings in any dimension one gains insight

into the rules of computing non-perturbative d-brane contributions. it is the aim of this
article to pursue these ideas further. the subject are eight-dimensional1 heterotic and
type i string vacua coming from toroidal compactication of ten dimensions. we calculate
various couplings of higher spacetime derivatives and higher order in  for both heterotic
(section 2) and type i string vacua (section 3) and compare them: in section 2.1 we review
the heterotic r4 couplings, since they capture a part of the structure of the f 4 couplings
which originate in the torus compactication to eight dimensions. these couplings are

calculated in section 2.2. and 2.3. the latter section contains also closed expressions for

worldsheet  integrals with an arbitrary number of lattice vector insertions. in section
2.4. we calculate the higher order corrections r4t 4g4, which have a nice interpretation on
the dual f theory side. the type i calculation of these couplings are presented in sections
3.1-3.3. in section 3.4. we show that, a part of the heterotic r4t 4g4 couplings has an
intriguing physical interpretation in term of the dual type i string picture as dinstanton
sum. finally in section 3.5. we nd a oneloop r2 corrections in eightdimensional type
i string theory and give its explanation on the heterotic side.

2. heterotic string in eight dimensions

in this section we consider t 2 compactications of the heterotic string. the heterotic
dilaton in eight dimensions is a real scalar in the supergravity multiplet [13]. therefore, it is

believed that there exist no higher than oneloop perturbative corrections, since by super-

symmetry they would also aect the einstein term. at string oneloop, higher derivative
couplings such as f 4, (f 2)2, r4 and (r2)2 and their respective anomalycancelling cp 
odd parts receive corrections in the eective string action. these constant contributions

are highly xed by tendimensional anomaly cancellation arguments. in green-schwarz

formalism they are calculated by (almost) holomorphic one loop string amplitudes, whose

minimal number of external legs is xed by saturating fermionic zero modes. the result

for the amplitudes is summarized by the worldsheet  integral over a weight zero almost

holomorphic function which is related to the elliptic genus [14][15]. after compactication
on t 2 these corrections become moduli dependent functions. it is believed that there are
no spacetime instanton eects, since the only supersymmetric soliton, the ns vebrane,

cannot be wrapped around the torus. on the other hand, the nonanomaly related coupling
to j0 = t8t8r4  1
8 1010r4 may receive higher perturbative as well as nonperturbative
corrections.

1 other interesting aspects of d = 8 theories have been recently discussed in [12].

2.1. ten dimensional origin

let us briey review the four graviton amplitude. the graviton vertex operator can be

read o from the background eld expansion of the heterotic sigma model on the worldsheet

torus [15][16] and reads in the green-schwarz formalism

depending on dierent ways of contracting bosonic elds the worldsheet integration

results in two dierent couplings [14]. contractions which are associated to permutation
cycles (1)(234) give rise to the tr r4 coupling g4, whereas contractions corresponding to
2
permutation cycles (12)(34) result in the (trr2)2 coupling g

non-holomorphic function g2 instead of g2.

the action (2.3) has also to be supplemented with the corresponding gscounterterm

which will provide us the cp odd part of our amplitudes and gives the eight derivatives

gravitational superinvariants i3, i4 [3].

2.2. f 4 heterotic couplings

for toroidal compactication the amplitudes include a lattice sum, which arises from
integration over zero modes of compactied bosons. in addition to the gauge group e8e8
or so(32) (without additional wilson lines) there are extra u (1) gauge groups. here we

will mainly concentrate on these u (1) gauge couplings and consider the case without and

with wilson lines separately. the internal gauge boson vertex operator can be read o

from the  model action. writing the internal metric as

4 supersymmetry relates even to odd spin structures. since periodic green-schwarz elds sa
are mapped to periodic nsr eld i, cp -odd correlation functions of nsr currents are equivalent
to cp -even correlation functions of green-schwarz currents due to a riemann identity [15].

this  -integral has been solved in [10] by the method of orbit decomposition [18] and

techniques developed in [19]. it has been shown in [10] that these four point functions
(2.12) are related to a holomorphic prepotential g(t, u ) which transform as a modular
function of weight (4, 4) under sl(2, z)t  sl(2, z)u duality. this is similar to vector
multiplet sector of n=2 supersymmetric string vacua in four dimensions. they arrange as

rather than restricting to the case (2.12), it is the purpose of this section to nd

general expressions for worldsheet  integrals with an arbitrary number of lattice vec-
tor pr, pr, pl and pl insertions. such integrals appear in n point string amplitudes of
toroidal string compactications. see also [19] for further discussions and [19][10][20][21]

for examples.

2.4. r4t 4g4 couplings

the heterotic eective action compacied on k3 t 2 contains higher derivative cou-
plings fgtrr2t 2g2, where t is the eld strength of the graviphoton. these couplings
appear at one loop [21] and only depend on the vector multiplet scalars. they do not
depend on the k3 moduli.7 therefore the modulidependence of these couplings should

in the decompactication to d = 8.

in fact, we
survive in the limit of large k3, i.e.
will show in this section, that the oneloop corrections to the couplings fgtrr4t 4g4 and
fg(trr2)2t 4g4 share the same moduli dependence. they are derived from a oneloop
amplitude with four graviton and (4g  4) graviphoton vertex operators. since the cp
odd amplitude is related to the cp even amplitude by supersymmetry, which results in

6 the hecke operator acts on a modular form w of weight w as hn [w](u ) =
1

kp=n p0j<k kww(u ) with the dbrane complex structure u = j+pu

7 however, they depend on the chosen gauge bundle. see e.g.: [24].

the same coupling, it is sucient to discuss the cp even case only. this part is highly

constrained by u (1) charge conservation of the internal c = 3 conformal eld theory. es-

sentially this means, that only the bosonic part of the graviphoton vertex operators give

nonvanishing contributions. for the cp -even amplitude we use (2.1) as graviton vertex

operator in zero ghost picture and the following graviphoton vertex operator in background

to (trr2)2t 4. dierent distributions of z1, z2derivatives in (2.38) lead to dierent lorentz

in four dimensions in counting curves of the k3 ber of a calabiyau manifold [20].

the amplitudes fg have no obvious relation to the r4h 4g4 iib couplings of [27].
in particular, the latter contain the set of (p, q) dstring contributions, which does not
exist in our vacua. moreover the couplings (2.42) behave like fg  (5  4g)c(0; 2g, 2g)
in the decompactication limit t  i to ten dimensions in contrast to the iib coupings
r4h 4g4, which give the famous dinstanton sum.

3. type i in eight dimensions

in this section we discuss two type i models (a) and (b). model (a) has e8 
e8  u (1)2 and model (b) so(8)4  u (1)2 gauge group. for model (a) we calculate
gauge threshold corrections w.r.t. to the u (1) factors, while for model (b) we derive the
corrections w.r.t. to the so(8). furthermore, we discuss type i r2 corrections.

3.1. f 4 type i couplings in model (a)

the dilaton dependence for surfaces with euler number  = 2  2g  b  c, is 
where g is the genus, b and c the number of boundaries and crosscaps, respectively.

now let us directly compute (3.1) in type i string theory. one loop open string

amplitudes consist of summing over oriented and unoriented surfaces with and without
boundaries like the torus (t ) and klein bottle (k) for the closed string sector and the
annulus (a) and mobius strip (m) for the open string sector, which have euler number
 = 0.

3.3. so(8)4 type i threshold corrections in model (b)

in this section we discuss the orientifold example of sen [30]. for this model

heterotic/f-theory duality can be checked explicitly [10]. the (discrete) wilson lines
1 = 1
2 (04, 14, 04, 14) break the gauge group to so(8)4. for this
ai
model the internal abelian gauge group cannot be enhanced [2] and the underlying pre-

2 (04, 04, 14, 14) and ai

2 = 1

potenial is trivial. i.e. in this case the corresponding oneloop gauge couplings f 4q
in (2.13) vanish identically [10].

3.4. dinstanton contribution

heterotic/type i duality maps winding modes of the heterotic string to winding modes

of d1-strings. heterotic worldsheet instantons that arise in the non-degenerate orbit a =

(cid:16) k j
0 p(cid:17) in the one loop amplitude, are dual to bps instantons which arise after wrapping

the euclidean worldsheet of d1 branes on the spacetime t 2. choosing a basis of two-
cycles on t 2, all inequivalent ways in which a t 2 can cover n -times another t 2 are given
by transformations that can be written in the form of the matrix a with kp = n and
0  j < k and p > 0 and n is the instanton number. the embedding of the d1-string
worldsheet into the target space torus is then given by xi = aijj.

the classical instanton saddle point is the exponent of the born-infeld action of the

wrapped d1-brane [7][8]:

sbi =

1

i z d2pdet(gi + f )  iz br

i ,

(3.14)

where g and br
u (1) gauge background of the open string.

i are the pull-backs of the metric and the antisymmetric tensor and f the

fluctuations around the classical instanton saddle point are described by the elliptic
genus a(u ) (and its descendents) for n d1-branes on t 2. similarly we can take a single
d1-brane wrapped n times over t 2. this is realized by the action of the hecke operator
on the elliptic genus hn [a](u). the complex structure u of the space-time t 2 is modied
according to u = j+pu
k with the conditions for j, p, k as above, e.g. the three inequivalent
ways a torus can double cover another torus is 2u , u

2 and 1

2 + u
2 .

let us consider nondeg

r4t 4g4  i1(g) from (2.40) (1 = 2 = ) as an example, which in

in analogy to semiclassical instanton calculations the correlation function in an in-

stanton background is obtained by saturating fermionic zero modes and integrating over

the moduli space of instantons. in this case the instanton moduli space is provided by the

heterotic matrix string model [33], which describes a worldsheet o(n ) two dimensional

in the infrared limit this gauge theory ows to a (8, 0) supersymmetric

gauge theory.
sn  zn
2 orbifold conformal eld theory. the elliptic genus for sn symmetric orbifolds is
naturally described by the action of the n th hecke operator on the elliptic genus [34]. it

is known from [35] and [36] that the elliptic genus for sn symmetric orbifolds is given by

the action of the n th hecke operator on the elliptic genus.

3.5. one-loop corrections to r2

let us rst briey review threshold corrections in four dimensional n = 2 string vacua,

which are torus compactications of six dimensional n = 1 string vacua. in heterotic string

vacua the einstein term does not get any one loop corrections. this fact gives rise to a

relation between threshold gauge couplings and the kahler metric [37]. since in type i

theory newtons constant is corrected at one loop [38][39], the dilaton has to be redened,

which provides the one loop correction to the type i kahler metric.

in eight dimensions this situation translates to the rr coupling. there are
no heterotic one-loop corrections, whereas in type i theory we will nd a non-vanishing

correction. the graviton vertex operator in the zero ghost picture is given in (3.6). let

us start with a two point amplitude. although the kinematic structure of a two point

amplitude vanishes due to the on shell constraints we can still calculate the four derivative

gravitational coupling. going to a three point amplitude which e.g.

includes a modulus

and two gravitons will give a non-vanishing kinematic structure and produce a derivative

on the two point coupling with respect to the modulus.

the torus amplitude for a two point graviton vertex insertions vanishes since the
fermionic zero modes cannot be saturated. but we can still get contributions from k,
a and m. we want to extract the order o(k4) term of the amplitude, which will only
produce a non-vanishing result, if at least eight fermions are contracted due to riemann

identities.

for non-oriented surfaces contractions between chiral and anti-chiral fermions are

where c0 = n 2n+24
2 in
eq. (2.31). in the decompactication limit i
grav disappears, in agreement with heterotic-
type i duality in ten dimensions [3]. the heterotic tree-level r2 term is dual to the disc
diagram on the type i side. duality relates this term to a oneloop correction to r2 on the

1 f 2

heterotic side. since such a term does not exist, we conclude that on the type i side it is a
combination of r2 and f 2
, which corresponds to the heterotic r2 term. in particular
this combination is such that no oneloop correction to r2 is predicted on the heterotic
side. a similar observation was recently made with the r2 correction in the duality of

heterotictype iia [40].
