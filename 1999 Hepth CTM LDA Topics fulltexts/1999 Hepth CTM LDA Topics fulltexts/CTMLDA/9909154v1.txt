on the non-abelian born-infeld action

abstract we discuss some aspects of the generalization of the born-infeld action
to non-abelian gauge groups and show how the discrepancy between
tseytlins symmetrized trace proposal and string theory can be cor-
rected at order f 6. we also comment on the possible quadratic order
fermionic terms.

while the talk i gave at the gong show session of carg`ese 99 summer
school was devoted to an outline of the main results of the paper cur-
vature terms in d-brane actions and their m-theory origin [1], this note
will be focused on another very interesting but not yet settled aspect of
the d-brane eective action : the generalization of the dirac-born-infeld
(dbi) action to non-abelian gauge groups.

the massless degrees of freedom of an isolated d-brane are its trans-
verse coordinates, a world-volume u (1) gauge eld, and the associated
fermions [2]. its eective action contains a dirac-born-infeld (dbi) (see
[3] for a recent review of the dbi action) and a wess-zumino (wz) piece.
while the wz part, describing the interactions of the d-brane with
ramond-ramond eld backgrounds, can be determined by anomaly can-
cellation and is therefore believed to be exact, the dbi piece is only reli-
able for small space-time curvatures, and in the low-acceleration regime.
indeed, for non constant gauge eld strength, the dbi action is corrected
by derivative terms [3, 4].

when n identical d-branes coincide, the transverse coordinates and
world-volume gauge elds become n  n unitary matrices. the non-
abelian generalization of the dbi action describing this dynamics has

been the subject of several recent papers. in the low-energy non-relativistic
limit one must recover the usual quadratic action of dimensionally-
reduced super yang-mills. the question is whether there exist less-trivial
truncations, taking into account relativistic eects in a controlled man-
ner. however, since [dm, dn]fpq = [fmn, fpq] for a non-abelian group,
the part of the action which depends on the eld strength but not on
its covariant derivative is ambiguous, contrary to the abelian case. one
simple proposal for the at space-time action has been put forward by
tseytlin [5] :

l = strq det( + 2f)

(1.1)

the prescription is to expand the born-infeld action as a formal power
series, symmetrize under all permutations of the (non-abelian) eld
strengths and then take the trace. the resulting action captures several
features of the full string theory.

first, since str(t8f4) = tr(t8f4), it reproduces the already well-
known f 4 which can be obtained from a direct four-point function on
the disk diagram [6] or by a two-loop function for the non-abelian
background gauge eld in open string theory [7].

second, in four dimensions, it reduces to the quadratic yang-mills
term for an (anti-)self-dual eld strength as pointed out in [8] where
bps states of the non-abelian bi action were investigated.

since it seems out of reach to test this proposal to higher orders in 
by a direct string theory computation  it would involve a six-point open
string amplitude on the disk or a four-loop  function!  one must use
indirect arguments. hashimoto and taylor have found a conguration [9]
which exhibits disagreements with the symmetrized trace prescription :
they considered a constant magnetic background eld [10] or, in the
dual string picture, a pair of intersecting rotated d2-branes living on a
torus. to the background considered in [9], it is possible to add a u (1)
part which corresponds to the simultaneous rotation of the two branes
in the dual picture. we expect that the spectrum still only depends on
the relative orientation of the branes. this abelian gauge eld imposes
further constraints on the form of the action.

for an (anti-)self-dual background, the spectrum obtained with the
symmetrized trace prescription exactly matches the string theory spec-
trum, a result not fully realized in [9]. for more general constant elds,
both results agree up to order ()4, which is consistent with the fact
that the symmetrized trace is the correct answer for f 4 terms, as al-
ready pointed out. the discrepancy appears at the sixth order and can
be solved at this order by adding terms with commutators of the elds
strength f = f ata to the action (1.1). for simplicity, we have only

considered terms with two commutators, but even with this restriction,
the test does not completly x the action. if we dene the tensors

to the action (1.1). we have also checked that for an (anti-)self-dual eld
strength, these additional terms vanish and, then, the eective action
reduces to the linear yang-mills action.

this situation seems somewhat similar to the problem studied by
douglas, kato and ooguri [11] where they demonstrate the necessity
to add commutators terms to the symmetrized trace in their d-kahler
potential (at sixth order) to reproduce the mass-shell conditions.

a more exhaustive and systematic investigation, combining the self-
duality and hashimoto-taylors constraints, would be desirable. for this
purpose, it seems convenient to use the following diagramatic represen-
tation to enumerate all the possible terms appearing at a given order
()n : the idea is to put each f eld at a vertex of a polygon of de-
gree n and to symbolize each lorentz contraction by a line joining these
points. the trace over the gauge group is taken in the standard order on
the polygon. for example, the str(f4) terms are given in gure (1.1).

figure 1.2 relation between diagrams for f = f .

notice that in the symmetrized trace, the weight of each term for a given
set of lorentz contractions are just the number of non-superimposable
diagrams under rotations preserving the polygon vertices : in this way,
in gure (1.1), the rst and third diagrams have weight two and the
second and fourth weight one. using this representation, one can easily
enumerate the possible terms at order ()6; there are exactly twenty
eight inequivalent diagrams : ve of the (f 2)3 type, nine (f 2)(f 4)
and fourteen f 6. moreover, for a self-dual eld strength, we have the
relation :

2(fmpfpn + fnpfpm) = mnfpqfqp

which can be translated into the diagrammatic equation of gure (1.2).
since for a self-dual eld strength higher-order terms should vanish [8],
this implies further constraints on the possible form of the action. how-
ever, using this rule, it is quite simple to analyse these constraints; for
example, it is easy to verify that the f 4 term in gure (1.1) vanishes for
a self-dual f .

let us conclude with some remarks : rst, the eective action should
also contain fermionic terms. aganagic, popescu and schwarz have pro-
posed a supersymmetric generalization of the abelian bi action [12]. to
study its generalization to non-abelian groups, we can use a test ana-
loguous to the one developed for the gauge eld in [9]. from the dual
string theory, one expect, for fermions in a constant gauge eld, a lan-
dau spectrum of the form :

212. arctan(2f12) + 234. arctan(2f34)

with ij = [i, j]. such spectrum can be obtained from the la-
grangian :

l2 = strh( + 2f)1

finally, seiberg and witten [13] have recently proved that the stan-
dard abelian bi action is equivalent, up to terms involving derivatives
of f , to the abelian bi for a non-commutative gauge eld by a eld

redenition. this result should still hold for the non-abelian theory. it
would be interesting to see what the symmetrized trace prescription on
one side gives on the other side. moreover, in the limit   0 con-
sidered in [13], the action on the non-commutative side reduces to the
non-commutative yang-mills lagrangian whereas it remains non-trivial
on the commutative side. since the generalization of this abelian ncym
to the non-abelian case is trivial, one can ask how this discussion can be
extend and give some insights on the commutative non-abelian side.
