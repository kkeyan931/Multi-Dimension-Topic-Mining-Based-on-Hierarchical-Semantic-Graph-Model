abstract

duality symmetric electromagnetic action `a la schwarz-sen is shown
to appear naturally in a chain of equivalent actions which interchange
equations of motion with bianchi identities. full symmetry of the
electromagnetic stress tensor is exploited by generalizing this duality
symmetric action to allow for a space-time dependent mixing angle
between electric and magnetic elds. the rotated elds are shown
to satisfy maxwell-like equations which involve the mixing angle as
a parameter, and a generalized gauge invariance of the new action is
established.

introduction

current interest in duality in string theory has brought about a wealth of
studies on similar symmetries present in other contexts, such as abelian
p-forms theories. the simplest among the latter, namely free electromag-
netism, has long been known to remain invariant under the interchange of
equations of motion with bianchi identities. the rst attempt to implement
this symmetry at the level of the basic elds of the action [1] involved non
local transformation among the a and e elds, in the hamiltonian (rst
order) version of the electromagnetic action. later on, a non covariant ac-
tion was proposed by schwarz and sen [2] where the transformation is made
local at the expense of doubling the number of gauge elds. when the equa-
tions of motion for some of the elds are used, the usual maxwell action is
recovered.

as it is well known, duality symmetry is actually more general than the
discrete interchange of electric with magnetic elds. it is a continuous sym-
metry, which gets reduced to a u (1) group when invariance of the symmet-
ric stress tensor1 is also imposed [3]. the conserved momentum associated
with this continuous symmetry is found to be the integral of chern-simons
terms, and full equivalence between maxwell and schwarz-sen actions has
been shown to remain valid at the quantum level [4]. moreover, covariant
generalizations of the schwarz-sen action have been found by introducing
either an innite number of auxiliary gauge elds [5] or nite additional
elds in a non polynomical way [6].

on the other hand, when considered as a symmetry of the stress ten-
sor, this duality symmetry is not the most general invariance, because the
stress tensor is also invariant under rotations with a dierent angle at each
spacetime point. we call this symmetry of the stress tensor fully-local du-
ality, to distinguish it from that of the schwarz-sen action, which is usually
called local duality (in opposition to the non-local transformations in [1]). in
fact, from our perspective, the duality symmetry of the schwarz-sen action
could be called global. our work is reminiscent of the passage from global
to local gauge invariance of complex matter elds, wherein gauge elds are
introduced in the covariant derivative.

the purpose of this work is twofold. we rst show how the schwarz-
sen action emerges from a chain of equivalent actions which interchange
equations of motion with bianchi identities. then we rewrite the schwarz-

sen action in terms of a complex gauge eld. we proceed afterwards to probe
the eects of such space-time dependent rotations on maxwell equations and
their implementation in a generalized version of the schwarz-sen action. we
nd that gauge invariance remains valid when suitable generalized. at the
end we present the conclusions.

the schwarz-sen action

free electromagnetism equations of motion2,

with

f [a] = 0 ,

f [a] = a  a ,

can be obtained from the action

s[a] = 

1

4 z d4xf  f ,

and bianchi identities

hold automatically, with

 f [a] = 0 ,

f [a] =

1
2

f[a] .

alternatively, we can vary

with

obtaining

as equations of motion and

s[z] = 

1

4 z d4x f  f

f [z] = z  z.

 f  [z] = 0

f  [z] = 0

2we use the metric g = diag(+1, 1, 1, 1).

if we dene ei = f i0 and bi =  1

as bianchi identities, with f  [z] dened by a relation analogous to eq.(5).
2 ijkfjk , regardless of whether f
depends on a or z, we see that the eect of passing from s[a] to s[z]
is to interchange equations of motion with bianchi identities.

now, s[a] is equivalent to the rst order action

s[a, f ] = z d4x(cid:20) 1
= z d4x(cid:20) 1

f (a  a)(cid:21)

f  f 
2 (cid:16)b2  e2(cid:17)  e  a  e  a0  b    a(cid:21)

(10)

where a = (a0, a). as it is well known, a and f are independent elds
in this approach, but varying with respect to f denition (2) is recovered,
and replacing it in s[a, f ], we get back s[a]. now, varying s[a, f ]
with respect to bi and a0, yields b =   a and   e = 0, respectively.
replacing these last equations in (10) we get

s[ai, ei

t ] = z d4x(cid:26) ei

ai

2 he2

t + (  a)2i(cid:27)

(11)

where et indicates that only the transversal part of e survives. hence, an-
other vector potential can be introduced through et =   z. as we shall
see, z will be later identied with the spatial components of the tetravector
z, already introduced. then s[ai, ei

t ] can be written as

s[ai, zi] = 

1

2 z d4xh  z  a    a  z + (  a)2 + (  z)2i ,

(12)
where an integration by parts has been performed, thus exhibiting the sym-
metry between z and a. the equations of motion are now

e =   z =     a =   b
b =   a =     z =   e

(13)

some comments are in order. first note that the assignment in s[ai, zi] of
(13) as equations of motion and   e =   b = 0 as bianchi identities,
corresponds neither to s[a] nor to s[z].
it is a mixture between the
assignments in both actions. secondly, we could go through steps similar
to those that led us from s[a] to s[ai, zi], but now in reverse order and
with z taking the place of a. the antisymmetric disposition of z and a

4

in the rst terms of s[ai, zi] necessitates the denition z = (z0, z), which
should be compared to a = (a0, a). we would end up with an action
which can be identied with s[z] as dened in (6).

at this point, schwarz-sen action is obtained from s[ai, zi] noting that

for any functions a0 and z0,

z d4xa0  z = z d4xz0  a = 0 ,

(14)

so that

s[ai, zi] = s[a, z] =

1

= 

2 z d4xh  z(cid:16) a + a0(cid:17)    a(cid:16) z + z0(cid:17)
+ (  a)2 + (  z)2i ,

(15)

which is easily recognized as the schwarz-sen action. eq.(15) summarizes
one of the main results of this work: we see that s[a, z] emerges in the
middle point of a chain of equivalent actions that lead from s[a] to s[z]
and backwards, interchanging equations of motion with bianchi identities.
it should be stressed that the a0 and z0 elds of the schwarz-sen action
bear no relation to those which appear in s[a] and s[z]. in the former
case, advantage is taken of relation (14) to make the integral nicely depen-
dent on two four-potentials, while in the latter case they are used to impose
the constraints   e = 0 and   b = 0 .

complex eld formulation

if we dene  = a + iz , 0 = a0 + iz0 ,  = (0, ) 3, schwarz-sen
action can be written as

1

s[, ] = 

2 z d4x(cid:26) i
 (cid:16)  + 
varying with respect to  yields

2 h(cid:16)  + 0(cid:17)    
0(cid:17)    i +       o .

   = i

3with our choice  is not a tetravector since in its denition covariant and contravari-

ant components are summed. other choices would render it a tetravector.

which is the same as eq.(13), while variation with respect to  yields the
complex conjugate equation.

s[, ] is separately invariant under the local gauge transformations

where 1, 2, 1 and 2 are arbitrary gauge functions satisfying apropi-
ate boundary conditions. in case we want the surface term picked by the
lagrangian to be real, conditions 1 =

imposed. the lagrangian is also invariant under the simultaneous global

which gets reduced to the known discrete duality transformation for  =

current j = (j0, j) 4 , where

in terms of the original a and z elds, the conserved momentum reads

given a conguration of electromagnetic elds

f = b + ie

which satises maxwell equations

if we rotate them through

  f = 0
f = i  f ,

f = ei(x)f ,

with a space-time dependent angle (x), the rotated elds satisfy

where

is a kind covariant derivative. now, taking the real and imaginary parts
of eqs.(31-32) we have a total of eight equations. were one to solve the
four  therefrom, they would be overdetermined. the four compatibility
conditions turn out to be

t(e2 + b2) +   (e  b) = 0

1

t(e  b) + e    e + b    b  b(  b)  e(  e) = 0

(34)

which are just the conservation equations of the stress tensor, but now for
the rotated elds. this is actually not a piece of news, since the stress
tensor is invariant under (30). of course, not every conguration satisfying
the four eqs.(34) comes from a u(1)-local rotation of another conguration
which satises maxwell equations, since the  eld solved from eqs.(31-
32) must satisfy the integrability conditions   =  .

now, since the original elds f were derived from

f =    ,

(35)

7

the rotated elds can be derived from a rotated potential using a covariant
rotor

eq.(32) reads now

f = ei(x)f = d  
 = ei(x)

dtd   = id  d  

(36)

(37)

this equation can be obtainted from the following generalization of the
schwarz-sen action,

s[, , ] =

2 z d4x(cid:26) i

[(dt + d0)  d  

(38)

 (dt + d

variation with respect to  yields eq.(37), and with respect to 
it complex conjugate. varying with respect to  yields no new equations.

conclusions

we have shown that the duality symmetric schwarz-sen action is the middle
point of a chain of equivalent actions, which interchange equations of motion
with bianchi identities. space-time dependent duality rotations were studied
and the equations obeyed by the rotated elds were obtained, along with
a generalized action from which these equations are derived. remarkably,
the gauge symmetries of this action are a natural extension of those of the
schwarz-sen action.

an important property of the new equations (31-32) is that for any
(x), every solution of them is mapped one-to-one to a solution of maxwell
equations. among further developments of this work would be to show how
this equivalence holds at the quantum level. this involves an analysis of the
constrain structure of s[, , ]. moreover, coupling to external currents
in a fully-local-duality-preserving way is also worth studying. we hope to
deal with these topics in a next work.
