it is emphasized that compactied little string theories have compact moduli spaces

of vacua, which globally probe compact string geometry. compactifying various little
string theories on t 3 leads to 3d theories with exact, quantum coulomb branch given
by: an arbitrary t 4 of volume m 2
s , and moduli spaces
of g = su (n ), so(2n ), or e6,7,8 instantons on an arbitrary t 4 or k3 of xed volume.
compactifying instead on a t 2 leads to 4d theories with a compact coulomb branch

s , an arbitrary k3 of volume m 2

base which, when combined with the exact photon gauge coupling ber, is a compact,

elliptically-bered space related to the above spaces.

1. introduction

over the past few years, there have been a variety of connections between the moduli

spaces of supersymmetric gauge theories and stringy geometry. for example, singular

background geometry or gauge bundles can lead to enhanced, non-perturbative, gauge

theories, whose moduli spaces reproduce the local singularity [1,2]. another connection is

via branes, whose world-volume supersymmetric gauge theory has a moduli space which

probes [3,4] the geometry in which the branes live. in an extreme form of this connection

[5], we perhaps actually live in the moduli space of a supersymmetric theory. it is thus

interesting to consider, generally, what types of geometry can be reproduced via moduli

spaces of vacua.

a basic issue is whether moduli spaces of vacua can be compact. moduli spaces of

vacua of standard gauge theories are generally non-compact cones: if a given set of scalar
expectation values hii is a d-at vacuum, so is hii for arbitrary scaling factor   .
(this is slightly modied by fayet-iliopoulos terms for u (1) factors.) an exception is the

coulomb branch moduli, associated with the wilson lines, of gauge theories which are

compactied on tori; these moduli live on dual tori, modded out by the weyl group.

the present note is devoted to emphasizing that toroidally compactied little string
theories [6]1 can have a variety of interesting, compact, moduli spaces of vacua. the

present discussion is an elaboration of a footnote which appeared in [10]. the basic message

is that, while world-volume gauge theories only locally probe the geometry transverse to

the brane, little string extensions can globally probe compact geometry. while this fact is

perhaps well-known to some experts, it is hoped that some readers will nd it of interest.
for example, the basic n = (1, 0) heterotic little string theory, when compactied
on t 3, is argued to have a coulomb branch moduli space of vacua which is a k3 of
volume m 2
2 , this has the correct dimensions.)
the coulomb branch is a non-linear sigma model with exact, quantum metric equal to the

s . (since a 3d scalar has mass dimension 1

ricci-at metric of k3. the k3 is an arbitrary one of xed volume, whose parameter space
coincides with that of the t 3 compactied heterotic little string theory; the map between

these parameter spaces is the same as enters in the duality between the 10d heterotic string
on t 3 and m theory on k3. geometric symmetries of the k3 coulomb branch map to
non-trivial t-dualities of the t 3 compactied little string theory.

1 the extent to which these 6d theories decouple from the 10d bulk, for energies above some

gap value, is subtle [7,8,9]; we will ignore these issues and only discuss the vacuum manifold.

1

more generally, it will be argued that the little string theories obtained in [10] from
k heterotic (or type ii) ns branes at a transverse c2/g singularity, when compactied
on t 3, have a compact coulomb branch moduli space of vacua given by the moduli space
of k g-instantons on k3 (or t 4). here g is an arbitrary a, d, e group and g is the
corresponding su (2) subgroup. the k3 or t 4 appearing here is precisely that of m

theory duality, which the compactied little string theory globally probes. the volume of

the compact coulomb branch is again set by ms. in each case, the coulomb branch sigma

model metric must be the unique one which is ricci at.

similarly, it will be argued that little string theories, when compactied to 4d on a t 2,

have coulomb branches which globally probe f theory. the coulomb branch is the base

space of f theory, and the photon kinetic terms are the elliptic bration. for example,
compactifying the basic n = (1, 0) little string theory on t 2 leads to a 4d theory whose
total space of coulomb branch base and seiberg-witten curve is an elliptically bered k3
of volume m 2
s . the map between the t 2 compactication data and the parameter space
of xed volume, elliptically bered, k3 spaces is the same as in the duality between the
10d heterotic theory on t 2 and f theory on an elliptically bered k3 [11].

the next section will review little string theories and their compactication, with
several new minor comments included. sect. 3 outlines classical t 3 dimensional reduction

of ordinary 6d u (1) and su (2) gauge elds. this already leads to compact coulomb
branches, of xed volume g2
6 ; the coulomb branch for u (1) is t 4, while that of su (2)
is k3. sect. 4 extends the probe argument of [12] to argue for our main message: that
compactifying little string theories on t 3 leads to theories whose exact coulomb branch
is compact and globally probes the t 4 or k3 of m theory duality. sect. 4 discusses t 2

compactication of little string theories, which similarly have compact coulomb branches

that globally probe compactication of f theory, e.g. on elliptically bered k3s.

the proposed relation of [10] between compactied type ii little string theories and
moduli spaces of instantons on t 4 also entered in [13,14,15], where it was extended to
moduli spaces of instantons on a non-commutative t 4 by introducing r-symmetry twists

in the compactication. a relation between the twisted, compactied (2, 0) theory and k3

was proposed in [14]; this appears to be unrelated to the presently discussed appearance of

k3 in the context of the untwisted, compactied, heterotic little string theories. much as

in [14,15], it should also be possible to introduce r-symmetry twists for the compactied

heterotic little string theories, perhaps leading to moduli spaces of instantons on a non-

commutative k3, though this will not be done here.

2

2. review of little string theories and their compactication

four classes of 6d little string theories were obtained in [6] via the world-volume of

5-branes in the limit gs  0 with ms held xed:
(iia) n = (1, 1) supersymmetric, via k iib ns ve-branes [6] or via iia or m theory with

a c2/g ale singularity [16,17].

(iib) n = (2, 0) supersymmetric, via k type iia ve branes [6] or type iib with a c2/g

singularity [16].

(o) n = (1, 0) supersymmetric, via k so(32) heterotic small instantons.
(e) n = (1, 0) supersymmetric, via k heterotic e8  e8 small instantons.

6 = m 2

cases (iia) and (o) contain gauge elds with coupling g2

instantons in the 6d gauge theories are fundamental strings, with tension g2

s and are ir free.
6 = m 2
s .
cases (iib) and (e) instead contain tensor multiplet two-form gauge elds, with self-dual

eld strength, and lead to interacting rg xed point eld theories in the ir.

n = (1, 0) tensor multiplet theories (of which n = (2, 0) is a special case) always
have an associated group g. for cases (iib) it is su (k) or the ade singularity group g,

while for (e) it is sp(k). there is a r =rank(g) dimensional, compact coulomb branch
moduli space, with the real scalars in the n = (1, 0) tensor multiplets taking values h~i
in the g-coxeter box (s1)r/wg, where the s1 is of radius m 2
s and wg is the weyl
group of g. the theory is interacting at the boundaries of the coxeter box but, in the

bulk, behaves in the ir as r free self-dual tensor multiplets. strings are charged under

the r 2-form gauge elds of these tensor multiplets, with charge vectors ~ in the g root
lattice2. via a bps formula, a string with charges ~ has tension z = ~  ~, becoming
tensionless at the origin of the coulomb branch. reducing to 5d leads to a gauge theory

with non-abelian gauge group g at the origin, so the 6d theory can be regarded as a

non-abelian self-dual two-form gauge theory with group g (whatever that means).

2 because of the self-duality, these strings can be regarded as either electrically or mag-
netically charged. the dirac quantization condition thus implies that the lattice  must be an

integer lattice, i.e. the dot product of any two lattice vectors is an integer, so   e, where e

is the dual lattice. this is, of course, a weaker condition than self-duality of the lattice. for

example, the root lattice of a simple group g is generally not self-dual but, rather, a subgroup,

of degree given by the center of g, in the dual lattice, which is the weight lattice.

3

each of the four above classes has either vector or tensor multiplets, but not both.

theories containing both vector and tensor multiplets were discussed in [10] by combin-
ing 5-branes with c2/g orbifold singularities in the transverse dimensions, using results
obtained in [18-21]. in this way, new theories can be obtained for each of the four classes
of branes, type iia, iib, so(32) heterotic, and e8  e8 heterotic, at c2/g singularities.
all of these theories generally have n = (1, 0) supersymmetry.

u (1)d qr

e.g. k type iib ns 5-branes at a c2/g singularity [20] has a quiver gauge theory,
based on the extended dynkin diagram of the ade singularity group g, with gauge group
=0 su (kn) and bi-fundamental matter. n are the g dynkin indices and
r =rank(g). there are r n = (1, 0) tensor multiplets, which are associated, as described
above, with the singularity group g. via an anomaly cancellation mechanism, su (kn)
s ,0 + ~  ~ and an su (kn) instanton, which is a string
has gauge coupling g2
in 6d, has tensor-multiplet charges ~ and bps tension z = g2
,ef f . here the ~ are the
g root vectors (~0 is the extending root) and the condition that all g2
,ef f  0 is precisely
that the coulomb branch h~i is the g coxeter box, of side length m 2
s . the su (kn)
instanton string charges span the g root lattice.

,ef f = m 2

ding n in su (kn), has tension nz = m 2

the instanton string for a diagonal su (k)d qr
=0 su (kn), with index of embed-
s , and is identied with the fundamental iib
string. the other r independent instanton strings inqr
=0 su (kn) are to be identied
with the strings obtained [22] by wrapping the type iib 3-brane on the r independent,
fully collapsed, two-cycles of the c2/g singularity; m = 1 . . . r of these strings become
tensionless for h~i at a codimension m boundary of the coulomb branch coxeter box.

the simplest heterotic case is k so(32) 5-branes at a c2/g singularity [18-21]. the
theories are associated [10] with a subgroup h of the singularity group g, with g  h as
su (2p )  sp(p ), so(4p + 2)  so(4p + 1), so(4p )  so(4p ), e6  f4, e7  e7,
e8  e8. the gauge group and matter content is given by a quiver diagram, which is
the extended h dynkin diagram, with so, sp, and su groups at various nodes, e.g. the
group at the  = 0 node is sp(k). there are r =rank(h) n = (1, 0) tensor multiplets,
which are associated with the group h. via an anomaly cancellation mechanism, the gauge
s ,0 + ~  ~,
group at node  = 0 . . . r of the quiver diagram has coupling g2
and an instantons string in this group has tensor multiplet charges ~ and bps tension
z = g2
,ef f . here ~ are the simple and extending roots of h, so the instanton strings span
the h root lattice. instantons in a diagonal sp(k)d are identied with the fundamental
heterotic string, of tension m 2
s . the other r independent instanton strings can again be

,ef f = m 2

4

identied with 3-branes wrapped on collapsed two-cycles; m = 1 . . . r of these become

massless at a codimension m boundary of the coulomb branch (the h coxeter box).

the other heterotic case, k e8  e8 5-branes at a c2/g singularity, leads to little
string theories with a more involved spectrum of tensor multiplets, gauge groups, and

matter content [21,10].

compactifying on a circle, 6d vector and tensor multiplets both lead to 5d vector
multiplets. a 6d n = (1, 0) theory with a gauge group of rank rv and nt tensor multiplets,
when compactied, leads to a 5d theory with a coulomb branch moduli space of vacua of

dimension dc = rv + nt . compactifying to 4d, the coulomb branch has real dimension

2(rv + nt ) and in 3d, upon dualizing the dc photons, there is a coulomb branch of real

dimension 4(rv + nt ).

little string theories exhibit t-duality when compactied on a circle [6], with the (iia)

theory on a circle of radius r identical to the (iib) theory on a circle of radius 1/m 2

s r.
similarly, the (o) heterotic theory, on a circle of radius r, and with a wilson line around
the circle breaking so(32) to so(16)  so(16), is identical to the (e) heterotic theory
on a circle of radius 1/m 2
s r, again with a wilson line breaking e8  e8 to so(16) 
so(16). (see [23] for the heterotic t-duality with general wilson lines.) in these cases,
t-duality exchanges 6d tensor and vector multiplets, rv  nt . this is nice because the
5d classical kinetic terms for the scalars coming from 6d tensor multiplets, m 4
s r(d)2, is
indeed exchanged with the kinetic term, g2
6 r(r1d)2, of a vector multiplet on a circle
of radius r. in both cases  is a compact scalar, normalized so   [0, 1], and the two
kinetic terms are exchanged by r  (m 2

s r)1 upon setting g2

6 = m 2
s .

more generally, there is an expected t-duality, with r  (m 2

s r)1 exchanging the
theories coming from iia and iib or so(32) and e8  e8 heterotic branes at c2/g
singularities. t-dual theories must have rv + nt = erv +ent . as was noted in [24,10],

this is the case for the so(32) and e8  e8 branes at singularities: both cases have
rv + nt = c2(g)k  |g|, where c2(g) is the dual coxeter number of the singularity
group g and |g| is its dimension. this formula will be important in what follows. a point

of concern mentioned in [10] is that a stronger condition, rv =ent and nt =erv , needed

for t-duality to exchange the classical kinetic terms as above, is not satised. the present

situation is, in fact, closely connected to that of [25], where it was argued that t-duality

can fail. here, however, there is a simpler resolution: the coulomb branch metric can get

quantum corrections and, while the quantum corrected metrics are expected to agree, the

classical metrics need not. the stronger condition is thus unnecessary.

5

all little string theories, when compactied on t d, have the parameter space [6]

o(d + y, d; z)\o(d + y, d)/o(d + y)  o(d),

(2.1)

where y = 0 for the type ii cases and y = 16 for the heterotic cases. these are the t d
metric and bn s elds (d2 real parameters), and also the so(32) or e8  e8 wilson lines
in the heterotic cases (16d real parameters). o(d + y, d; z) is the full t duality group.

3. compactication preliminaries

we rst consider the classical dimensional reduction of a 6d u (1) gauge eld,

z d6x(

1
4g2
6

f f  + bn s  f  f ),

(3.1)

on a t 3 to three dimensions. bn s is an external, background, two-form gauge eld. we
take space to be r3  t 3, with r3 coordinates xi, i = 1, 2, 3, and periodic coordinates
a  [0, 1], a = 1, 2, 3, for the t 3; the metric is ds2 = ij dxidxj + habdadb. taking all
elds to be independent of the t 3 coordinates a, (3.1) becomes

s =z d3x"det h

g2
6

4 fij f ij + 1

( 1

2 (h1)abiaib) + aijkfijka# ,

(3.2)

where bn s = abcadb  dc for some constants a, a = 1, 2, 3. the three real scalars a
are associated with the wilson lines of the gauge eld around the cycles da of the t 3 and
are periodic, normalized so that a  [0, 1].

the 3d u (1) gauge eld can be dualized to another real scalar, which also lives on
a circle. this is done as in [26]: we replace fij  fij  hij in (3.2) and introduce an
additional term ijkhijk4, with the scalar 4 periodic, normalized so that 4  [0, 1].
first integrating out 4 leads back to the original theory. first integrating out h sets
fij = 0 and leads to 4 kinetic terms. combining with the a kinetic terms in (3.2), the
upshot is a t 4 coulomb branch moduli space of vacua hai, a = 1, . . . 4, with metric

ds2 =

(h1)abdadb +

g2
6det h

(d4  ada)2  gabdadb,

(3.3)

det h

g2
6

where a runs over 1, 2, 3 and a = 1, . . . 4. this metric gab has 10 real components, which
depend on the 9 real parameters hab and a, and thus satises one constraint. the relation
is that the t 4 of (3.3) has xed volume, independent of the hab and the a:

volume(t 4) =qdet(gab) =

1
g2
6

= m 2
s .

6

(3.4)

although the above discussion was purely classical, the map (3.3) between the t 3
metric hab and b elds a is exactly the relevant one for relating type iib string theory
on t 3 to m theory on t 4, to be discussed in the next section. indeed, the map (3.3) was

also obtained in [15] in the context of the compactied (2, 0) theory via a chain of string

duality gymnastics.

we pause to note that the metric (3.3) nicely exhibits properties to be expected based

on its connection to m theory.
in particular, the obvious, geometric sl(4; z) discrete
symmetries of the t 4 correspond to non-trivial t-dualities, in a subgroup of the t-duality
group appearing in (2.1). for example, consider the obvious requirement that the t 4
be invariant under the relabeling exchange 3  4. taking, for simplicity, t 3 with
hab = l2
aab and a = 0, it follows from (3.3) that this operation corresponds to the
operation

l1  (m 2

s l2)1, l2  (m 2

s l1)1, l3  l3,

(3.5)

where we set g2
s . this is a t duality in two circles, which is non-trivial but,
nevertheless, a symmetry taking the iia or iib theory back to itself. the generalization of

6 = m 2

the t-duality (3.5) for general hab and a is quite complicated, see e.g. [27]; remarkably,
it is indeed reproduced from (3.3) by simply requiring the 3  4 symmetry.

on the other hand, t-duality in an odd number of cycles, such as the o(3, 3; z)
element taking all li  (m 2
s li)1, for i = 1, 2, 3, is not a geometric sl(4; z) symmetry
of (3.3). this is sensible, since such operations are not symmetries of iia or iib string

compactications but, rather, exchange iia and iib.

in particular, starting instead from a 6d tensor multiplet, dimensional reduction on a
t 3 leads to a t 4 coulomb branch moduli space, with metric related to (3.3) by t-duality
in an odd number of the t 3 cycles, corresponding to the exchange of iia and iib.

now consider t 3 reduction of a 6d su (2) gauge theory. the above discussion for u (1)

carries over to this case with almost no changes. the only dierence is that the real scalars
a must be modded out by the weyl group action a  a. modding out the t 4 by this
z2 action leads to a k3. thus the coulomb branch of a 6d su (2) gauge theory reduced
to 3d on a t 3 is given by hai in a compact k3. the volume of the k3 is again set by g2
6 ,
and equal to m 2
s . the full parameter space of k3 metrics of xed volume is 57 dimensional
and given by (2.1) with d = 3 and y = 16, while that obtained here only depends on the

9 dimensional subspace given by (2.1) with d = 3 and y = 0. the remaining parameters

will come from 3 real masses for each of 16 su (2) fundamental matter avors; these enter

as the wilson loop parameters in (2.1).

7

4. the probe argument, checks, and comments

the parameter space (2.1) for t 3 compactied heterotic (or type ii) little string
theories coincides with the geometric parameter space of a k3 (or t 4) of xed volume.

p v ol(y ) = m 2

these are, of course, the standard miracles which enter in the duality between the 10d
heterotic (or type ii) string on t 3 and m theory on y =k3 (or t 4). the fundamental
string arises as the m5 brane wrapped on y , so m 6

s . we will here extend
the probe argument of [12] to argue that these m theory dualities provide the solution for
the exact, quantum, coulomb branch metric of the t 3 compactied little string theories.
recall that the argument of [12] started with 3d n = 4 supersymmetric (8 super-
charges) su (2) gauge theory with fundamental matter, which is the world-volume eld
theory in a d2 brane in type i string theory on t 3. this maps to a m2 brane in m
theory on k3, which can be at an arbitrary point in the transverse r4  k3. the r4
corresponds to a decoupled hypermultiplet in the world-volume theory. the k3 factor is

more interesting: it was thus argued in [12] that the full, quantum-corrected metric on the

coulomb branch of the d2 brane world-volume eld theory must be a local piece of the

corresponding k3; this was conrmed in [26] purely in the context of 3d eld theory.

the d2 brane world-volume eld theory only locally probes the k3 because of the
particular limit taken to decouple the bulk dynamics: gs  0 and ms  . on the other
hand, we can take gs  0, but with ms held xed. this theory is precisely the 6d heterotic
little string theory (o), compactied to 3d on the same t 3 as the 10d heterotic or type i
bulk theory. the t 3 compactied little string theory (o) globally probes the xed volume

k3 of m theory, and must thus have a coulomb branch moduli space of vacua which is
the same k3. the geometric k3 has volume m 2

and, taking into account how the

s m 6

p

properly normalized coulomb moduli scalars probe geometry, the volume of the coulomb
branch k3 is m 2
coulomb branch properly becomes non-compact in the eld theory limit m 2

s . this matches with the result of the previous section. this compact

s  .

the k3 coulomb branch can have singularities, depending on the choice of parameters

in (2.1). as in [12], these singularities mark the intersection of the coulomb branch with

a higgs branch, with an interacting 3d infra-red conformal eld theory at the intersection.

unfortunately, both sides in the present equivalence, between the quantum coulomb
branch of the t 3 compactied little string theory on the one hand, and the metric of

k3 on the other, are presently not well understood. perhaps the present equivalence will

eventually be useful for using one of the two sides to learn about the other.

8

a direct generalization of the above is to consider a t 3 compactication of the little

string theory (o) associated with k so(32) heterotic small instanton. this maps to k
m2 branes at points on r4  k3. the coulomb branch is, correspondingly, the symmetric
product (k3)k/sk , where each k3 is again of xed volume m 2
s .

the geometric symmetries (see, e.g.

[28]) of the coulomb branch k3 correspond to

non-trivial t-dualities in (2.1) though, as in (3.5), only the subgroup which takes the

so(32) heterotic theory back to itself. an additional z2 component of t-dualities in
o(19, 3; z) reects the fact that, instead compactifying the e3  e8 heterotic little string
(e), with t-dual t 3 compactication data, also yields the same 3d theory, with the same

k3 compact coulomb branch as described above.

each of the little string theories reviewed in sect. 2 can be compactied to 3d on a t 3,

and each has an exact quantum coulomb branch which globally probes the dual m theory

compactication. in each case, there is a compact coulomb branch component, with unit
volume in units of ms. the 3d eld theory limit is recovered by taking ms  .

the n = (1, 1) little string theories with group u (k), when compactied on t 3, have
a coulomb branch which is (r4  t 4)k /sk (more generally, (r4  t 4)rank(g)/weyl(g)),
which probes the duality between type ii strings on t 3 and m theory on t 4. the coulomb
branch t 4 has metric gab which is given exactly in terms of the t 3 compactication date
by (3.3), with volume m 2
s . there is a similar statement for the n = (2, 0) little string
theory on t 3, diering from the n = (1, 1) case by a t-duality in one of the t 3 cycles;
the xed volume t 4 in this context was also discussed in [14,15].

the n = (1, 0) little string theories associated with k type ii or heterotic 5-branes at
an xg  c2/g singularity, when compactied on t 3, similarly probe m theory geometry.
in the heterotic (or type ii) cases, the m theory dual is given by k m2 branes with a
transverse space xg  k3 (or xg  t 4). in both cases, m theory with a xg singularity
has an enhanced g gauge symmetry and m2 branes, when sitting directly on top of the

g singularity of xg, can be interpreted as small g instantons. in the heterotic (or type
ii) cases, these k g-instantons have the xed volume k3 (or t 4) as their four spatial

coordinates. there is a moduli space for these instantons given by their positions in these

four spatial coordinates, as well as their moduli for fattening up and rotating in g.

thus, by the probe argument, the little string theory associated with k heterotic (or
type ii) branes at a c2/g singularity, when compactied on a t 3, has a compact coulomb
branch moduli space of vacua which is exactly given by the moduli space of k g-instantons
on a k3 (or t 4) of volume m 2

s . a quick check is that the dimension of the coulomb branch

9

of the t 3 compactied little string theories indeed agrees with the dimension of the moduli
space of k g-instantons3 on t 4 or k3: the type ii cases indeed have 4(rv +nt ) = 4kc2(g)
and the heterotic cases indeed have 4(rv + nt ) = 4(kc2(g)  |g|). this latter fact also
played a role in the mirror symmetry of [24].

another check is to consider the limit m 2

s  , where t 4  r4 or k3 becomes a
non-compact piece of k3, and where the compactied little string theory goes over to its

3d eld theory limit. in the type ii cases, the resulting 3d eld theory has the quiver gauge

groupqr

=0 u (kn), based on the extended g-dynkin diagram, which was indeed argued
in [29,30] to have a quantum coulomb branch which is the moduli space of k g-instantons
on r4. this theory was argued in [29] to have a hidden, global g symmetry. because m

theory has g gauge symmetry even for nite ms, the full compactied little string theory

is expected to also have this hidden global symmetry. similar statements should hold in

the heterotic cases.

moduli spaces of instantons on t 4 or k3 have made a variety of appearances in physics

moduli space also depend on va =ra

and mathematics, though usually with g = u (n ) as the gauge group. in that case, the
trf , where a is a basis for the two cycles of t 4 or
k3. in the present case, g is a simple a, d, e group so trf = 0. (b elds can possibly
still contribute to va 6= 0, e.g. as in [20].)

the moduli spaces of instantons obtained above have many interesting singularities.

at these coulomb branch singularities, there is an attached higgs branch, with an inter-

acting 3d ir cft at the intersection.

all of the above compact coulomb branches are hyper-kahler, with c1 = 0, and the

sigma model metric is the unique one which is ricci-at.

5. t 2 compactication: probing f theory

compactifying the heterotic (or type ii) little string theories to 4d on a t 2 leads to

quantum coulomb branches which globally probe f theory compactications on a xed
volume, elliptically bered k3 (or t 4). for example, consider the k = 1 case of the

heterotic little string theory (o), whose low-energy eld theory content is that of the world-
volume of d3 branes in type i on t 2. this latter theory has a non-compact, quantum

3 for a general 4 manifold with euler character  and signature , the dimension is 4kc2(g)

2 |g|( + ). for t 4,  =  = 0 and, for k3,  = 24 and  = 16.

coulomb branch which was argued [31,4] to locally probe the duality to f-theory on an

elliptically bered k3. the coulomb branch in the 4d eld theory is the non-compact

complex u plane, over which the photon coupling ef f (u) is bered according to the seiberg-

witten curve [32]; the total space of u-plane base and ef f (u) ber is a local, non-compact
piece of k3. this is the ms   limit of the t 2 compactied little string theory.

considering now the t 2 compactied little string theory for nite m 2

6 det h(h1)abdadb, which has volume g2

s , the u-plane
base is a compact box of volume m 2
s (this is the correct mass dimension for 4d scalars). as
in sect. 3, reducing a 6d u (1) gauge eld on a t 2 with metric habdadb leads to scalars
living on a dual t 2, with metric g2
s for
all hab. for su (2) rather than u (1), we mod out by the weyl group a  a, yielding
a 2d box of volume m 2
s . considering the elliptic ber  (u) over the compact base as a
dimensionless coordinate, the total space of base and ber is an elliptically bered k3 of
volume m 2
s . this elliptically bered k3 of xed volume is that of the f-theory dual to the
10d heterotic string on t 2. as was the case there, the parameter space (2.1) of data in the
t 2 compactication of the heterotic string matches that of the xed volume, elliptically
bered k3s. this can be regarded as a special case of the t 3 compactication considered

6 = m 2

in the previous sections, where one of the radii is taken to innity. it is thus good that we
again get a k3 of volume m 2

s , since that was the case in the previous sections for all radii.
more generally, t 2 compactifying the little string theories associated with k type ii 5-
branes at a c2/g singularity leads to a compact coulomb branch which is a 2(rv +nt ) =
2kc2(g) dimensional torus of unit volume in units of ms. including the kc2(g) complex
dimensional elliptic ber, associated with the kinetic terms of the kc2(g) photons, the
total space is the moduli space of k g-instantons on a t 4 of volume m 2
s , where both the
t 4 and the resulting instanton moduli space are regarded as an elliptic bration.

compactifying on a t 2 the little string theories associated with k heterotic 5-branes
at a c2/g singularity leads to a compact coulomb branch which is a 2(rv + nt ) =
2(kc2(g)  |g|) dimensional box, of unit volume in units of ms.
including the ber
associated with the photons, the total space is an elliptically bered space which is exactly
the moduli space of k g-instantons on an elliptically bered k3 of volume m 2
s .
