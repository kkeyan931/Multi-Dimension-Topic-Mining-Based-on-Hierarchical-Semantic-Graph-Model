(2). take r-r vertex operator (1/2, 1/2) picture (which exhibits r-r eld strengths rather potentials): vrr = h s(z) (z) eikx(z,z) h s(z) (01 p) (z) eikx(z) eiksx(z) , (11) h bispinor containing r-r eld strengths k momentum r-r potential. omitted superghost part keep track overall normalization, since able directly determine constant eq. (2) anyway.5 tachyon vertex operator put 1 picture: vt = (k) eikx(y) , (12) k tachyon polarization momentum point real axis. again, superghost part displayed. three insertion points z, z xed introducing ghost elds. contributions ghost, superghost x sectors combine (z z)5/4. contraction two spin elds fermionic sector gives < s(z) (z) >= (z z)5/4 c , c charge conjugation matrix. amplitude becomes h (01 p) c k , (13) (14) k global factor. tracing spinor indices, part h proportional h1...p+1(c1...p+1) contributes, making amplitude propor- tional h1...p+11...p+1. upon integration parts, conrms rst term eq. (2). kinematical subtlety computation. string scattering amplitudes computed on-shell external particles. easy convince oneself that, since tachyon carries momentum along brane momentum along brane conserved, tachyon r-r potential cannot on- shell. way out, one could consider branes euclidean signature, kinematical problem occur, extrapolate couplings one nds minkowski cousins. 4this done formalism non-bps d-branes constructed alternative way {$9808141$}. 5however, interested relative normalization amplitude respect ones photons inserted. constant xed previous paragraph. 5 check second term eq.

(2) linear f . note factor 2 multiplying f eq. (2) comes correctly. generalization multiple (low momentum) photon insertions straight- forward. dependence photon insertion points relevant part fermionic correlator factorizes, integration reduces one- dimensional integral described previous paragraph. also easy include chan-paton factors computations, leading trace eq. (2). fi- nally, one could check presence gravitational terms eq. (2) explicitly. since graviton vertex operators inserted (0, 0) picture, various contractions identical ones used ref. {$9808074$}. note that, technical point view, role tachyon computations provide superghost part, allowing one insert r-r vertex operator (1/2, 1/2) picture, instead (3/2, 1/2) one. thus inclusion tachyon proves wrong ones rst impression non-bps d- branes cannot couple closed string r-r sector gso-projection. apart this, computations perfectly parallel counterparts bps d-branes. 6 acknowledgement would like thank pieter-jan de smet walter troost discussions.
