abstract

we examine duality transformations of supersymmetric and -symmetric dp-brane

actions in a general type ii supergravity background where in particular the dilaton and

the axion are supposed to not be zero or a constant but a general supereld. due to

non-constant dilaton and axion, we can explicitly show that the dilaton and the axion

as well as the two 2-form gauge potentials transform as doublets under the sl(2, r)

transformation from the point of view of the world-volume eld theory.

1 introduction

notably with the advent of the dirichlet brane, which is nowadays referred to as the d-brane,
discovered by polchinski [1], the d-brane theory in various world-volume dimensions has been
widely recognized as an essential ingredient in which to discuss a variety of non-perturbative
aspects of superstring theory and m-theory, especially the ones concerning the intricate web
of string dualities [2].
it is also remakable that d-branes not only explain the origin of a
black hole entropy [3, 4] but also provide the elementary building blocks of matrix models
[5, 6]. thus it is desirable to achieve as thorough an understanding of physical properties of
d-branes as possible.

in a previous paper [7] we have shown that the supersymmetric and -symmetric dp-brane
actions [8, 9, 10] in a type ii supergravity background have the same duality transformation
properties as those in a at minkowski background [11]. specially, it is shown that super
d-string transforms in a covariant way while super d3-brane is self-dual under the sl(2, z)
duality. also, d2-brane and d4-brane transform in ways expected from the relation between
type iia superstring theory and m-theory.

however, in the study [7] we have conned ourselves to a restricted background geometry
where the dilaton and the axion are set to zero or a constant although the other elds are
considered to be general superelds. this restriction is obviously unsatisfactory from the
following three reasons.

first, the dilaton and the axion are ordinary interacting particles in the low energy theory
of superstring and thus should be treated on same footing as the other low energy elds such
as the graviton, the antisymmetric second rank tensor and fermoins.

second, in a type iib superstring or supergravity it is well known that the dilaton and
the axion as well as the two 2-form antisymmetric tensor elds, those are, the ns-ns 2-form
and the r-r 2-form, are doublets of the sl(2, r) mobius group whereas the graviton and
the 4-form gauge eld are singlets in the einstein metric. thus, if we wish to show that they
transform covariantly under the sl(2, r) transformation these local elds must be treated as
not constants but elds. in this context, notice that the vanishing or constant dilaton and
axion imply the vanishing 3-form eld strengths, so in order to understand the transformation
rules under the sl(2, r) we are led to consider the non-constant dilaton and axion. 3

finally, a study of general dilaton and axion may shed light on f-theory [12], a conjectured
12-dimensional quantum eld theory underlying a type iib superstring. f-theory is expected
to give a systematic description of the iib superstring with non  trivial dilaton and axion
background to which the complex structure of a two-dimensional torus would correspond.
according to these reasons, the extension of our previous work [7] to the non-constant dilaton
and axion system is not only valuable but also quite non-trivial.

in this paper, we will remove our previous restriction on the dilaton and the axion com-
pletely and prove that various duality transformations found in a type ii supergravity back-
ground with the constant or vanishing dilaton and axion [7] can be extended to a more general

situation where the dilaton and the axion are superelds depending on the supercoordinates
z m = (x m, ). therefore, the present study oers a complete proof that various duality
relations in the super d-brane actions, which were constructed in [8, 9, 10], exist in the general
on-shell type ii supergravity background geometry.

here let us summarize the results that will be obtained in this paper. as in the cases of a
at minkowski [11] and a type ii supergravity backgrounds [7] with the constant dilaton and
axion, we can show that the super d-string action is the (m, 1) string action with the ns-ns
charge m and the r-r charge 1. we prove that the super d3-brane action in the general
background is self-dual under the sl(2, z) duality transformation in both the classical and
the quantum-mechanical exact approaches. furthermore, it is shown that under a duality
transformation the super d2-brane and d4-brane actions transform in ways expected from
the relation between type iia superstring theory and m-theory. namely, the dual action of
the super d2-brane action is identied as the m2-brane action with a circular 11th dimension.
as for d4-brane, the double-dimensional reduction of the m5-brane action gives rise to the
dual action of the super d4-brane action.

it is worthwhile to point out the technical dierences between the case of the constant (or
zero) dilaton and axion and that of the non-constant dilaton and axion. moving the former
on to the latter, we would encounter at least two complications. the one is that we have to
introduce a new supereld , i.e., the dilatino supereld, associated with the dilaton supereld
in a theory, which gives rise to rather complicated constraint structures [8, 9]. indeed, due
to this complication we have conned our consideration to the constant or zero dilaton and
axion in our previous work [7]. the second complication that arises is that the non-constant
axion makes it impossible to use a convenient technique; in the case of the constant axion
we are free to add a theta term to the dual action at the end of calculations by hand to
derive the sl(2, z) covariance of the super d-string tension and the sl(2, z) self-duality
of the super d3-brane [11] while in the case of the non-constant axion we have to deal with
the corresponding wess-zumino term from the beginning. as mentioned in the above, this
convenient prescription is far from complete from the point of view of proof of the sl(2, r)
symmetry.

at this point let us comment briey several previous articles relating to the study at
hand. the duality transformations of the bosonic d-brane action have been investigated in
refs.[14, 15, 16, 17]. afterwards, supersymmetric d-brane actions with local kappa symmetry
were constructed in a at background [18] and in a type ii supergravity background [8, 9, 10].
various duality transformations in a at background have been claried in the context of the
super d-brane actions in ref.[11]. (see also an important paper [19].) recently, motivated by
ads/cft correspondence [20] the duality transformations of super d-string action [21] and
super d3-brane action [22, 23, 24] were claried in the ads5  s5 background. more recently,
we have generalized these works to a type ii supergravity background [13, 7]. however, these
works are not completely general in that we have limited our consideration to the constant
or zero dilaton and axion except super d-string [13]. the main motivation in this paper is
to present a full detail of the duality transformations of super d-brane actions constructed

2

in refs.[8, 9, 10] in a general type ii supergravity background. incidentally, there are several
interesting papers which attempt to construct actions of super d-branes with the manifest
sl(2, z)-duality and a dynamical tension [25, 26]. it would be of interest to ask possible
relations between these works and the present study in future.

this article is organized as follows. section 2 reviews super d-brane actions in a general
ii supergravity background [8, 9, 10]. in section 3 it is then proved in both classically and
quantum-mechanically exact manner that the super d-string action in a type iib on-shell
supergravity background is transformed to the type iib green-schwarz superstring action
[27] in a background with the ns-ns charge  and the rr-charge 1. section 4 deals
with the super d2-brane in a type iia on-shell supergravity background and presents that
the super d2-brane action can be transformed to the super m2-brane action with a circular
eleventh dimension by a duality transformation. in section 5 we show that the super d3-brane
action in a type iib on-shell supergravity background is mapped into itself by an s-duality
transformation, thereby verifying the sl(2, z) self-duality of the action. we shall oer both
classical and quantum-mechanical proofs here. in section 6 it is shown that the super d4-
brane action becomes identical to the supersymmetric action which is obtained in terms of
double-dimensional reduction of the super m5-brane action in the eleven dimensional space-
time through a duality transformation. the nal section will be devoted to discussions. in
appendix a brief review of the sl(2, r)/so(2) coset description of the dilaton and the axion
in the type iib supergravity is given and the type iib supergravity constraint equations are
shown to be invariant under the sl(2, r) duality transformation.

2 super d-brane actions

before describing our results for various duality transformations of super d-brane actions
[8, 9, 10] in a general type ii supergravity background, we shall review the salient points
of the superspace formulation of the super dp-brane theories. it is well known that super
dp-brane actions are divided into two pieces, namely, the dirac-born-infeld action and the
wess-zumino action in (p+1)-dimensional world-volume. the former includes the ns-ns
two-form, dilaton and world-volume metric in addition to abelian gauge eld while the latter
action contains the coupling of the d-brane to the r-r elds. the existence of this abelian
gauge eld is a peculiar feature of d-brane theories. the two terms are separately invariant
under type ii superspace reparametrizations as well as (p + 1)-dimensional general coordinate
transformations. however, local  symmetry is achieved by a suitable conspiracy between the
two pieces.

then, the super dp-brane actions in a general type ii on-shell supergravity background

which we consider in this paper are given by

s = sdbi + sw z,

(1)

3

with

sdbi = zmp+1
sw z = zmp+1

dp+1 e

p3

4 q det(gij + e 1

ef  c = zmp+1

p+1 = zmp+2

2 fij),
ip+2,

(2)

where i (i = 0, 1, . . . , p) are the world-volume coordinates,  the dilaton supereld, and
gij the induced einstein metric of the world-volume. we have dened various quantities as
follows:

f = f  b2,
f = da,

9

c =

c(n),

mn=0

ip+2 = dp+1 = d(ef  c),
mp+1 = mp+2,

(3)

where f is the maxwell eld strength 2-form, and the 2-form b2 is introduced in f such that
f is invariant under supersymmetry. and the r-r n-form elds c(n) are collected in c with
n taking odd integers for type iia and even integers for type iib. the integration of the
integrand (2) involves forms of various rank; the integral picks out precisely the terms that
are proportional to the volume form of the p-brane world-volume.

in addition, in order to describe the curved target superspace geometry we have to intro-

duce the superspace vielbein 1-form ea dened by

ea = dz m em

a,

(4)

with dz m denoting the superspace dierential (dx m, d), and the torsion 2-form t a = dea
as well as the curvature 2-form dened in terms of the spin connection a

b as

ra

b = da

b + a

c  c

b.

(5)

note that we have also dened as m = (m, ) in curved superspace while a = (a, ) in at
superspace as usual. the superspace vielbein 1-form ea in the tangent space decomposes
under the action of the lorentz group into a vector ea and a spinor e. we shall follow
the conventions that the lorentz spinor e is a 32-component majorana spinor for the type
iia superspace, on the other hand, a pair of 16-component majorana-weyl spinors for the
type iib superspace so that the latter may be written as ei with i being the n = 2 index
(i = 1, 2).

then the world-volume metric gij is represented by

gij = ei

aej

bab,

(6)

4

where ei

a = iz m em

a and ab = diag(, +, . . . , +).

throughout this paper we use following conventions for superspace forms. firstly, a

general n-form supereld (n) is expanded as

(n) =

=

1
n!
1
n!

dz mn  . . .  dz m1m1...mn,
ean  . . .  ea1a1...an,

(7)

where the superspace dierential dz m and the superspace vielbein ea are antisymmetric with
respect to bosonic coordinates while they are symmetric with respect to fermionic coordinates.
secondly, we dene the exterior derivative as an operator acting from the right

d((m)  (n)) = (m)  d(n) + ()nd(m)  (n).

(8)

now, following the paper [9], let us dene the ns-ns 3-form supereld h3 and the r-r

n-form supereld r as 4

h3 = db2,
r = eb2  d(eb2  c) =

10

mn=1

r(n).

(9)

it is obvious that from these denitions the eld strengths obey the following bianchi identities

dh3 = 0,
eb2  d(eb2  r) = dr  r  h3 = 0.

(10)

in order to reduce the enormous unconstrained eld content included in the superelds to
the eld content of the on-shell type ii supergravity theory, one has to impose the constraints
on the torsion and the eld strengths by hand, which make various bianchi identities coincide
with the equations of motion of type ii supergravity. the nontrivial constraints imposed on
the torsion and eld strength components [9] take the following forms for type iia:

where the round brackets enclosing indices denote symmetrization with strength one, and
then   1

the conventional pauli matrices i as follows:

(13)

based on this formulation of the super dp-brane actions in a type ii on-shell supergravity

background, we shall explore various duality symmetries in subsequent sections.

3 the super d-string

in this section we would like to consider the super d-string (i.e. the super d1-brane) rst.
the super d2, d3 and d4-branes will be treated in order in subsequent sections. in these
sections we shall prove various duality symmetries of the super d-brane actions in a type
ii on-shell supergravity background. the corresponding proofs have been already done in a
at minkowskian background [11] and a type ii supergravity background with the constant
or zero dilaton and axion [7]. a partial result was also presented in a type iib supergravity
background with the non-constant dilaton and axion [13]. the purpose of this section is to
oer the full detail and address the issue of the sl(2, z) symmetry in such a most general
background. our study appears to be quite important for future development in string
theory and m-theory since the global discrete symmetries such as the sl(2, z) s-duality are
nowadays believed to be exact symmetries in still mysterious underlying theory [28, 29] so
that these symmetries should be valid even in a curved background geometry.

in the case at hand, by making use of the superspace convention (7) the action (1), (2)

and the relevant constraints (12) for type iib reduce to

s = sdbi + sw z,
d2e 1

sdbi = zm2

(14)

(15)

where e, e and e represent the dirac conjugate of ei, eaa and ei, respectively. the
equations in (14) and (15) will serve as our basis for all subsequent considerations in this
section.

3.1 the classical analysis

in this subsection, we turn our attention to a duality transformation of the super d-string
action in a classical approach. next subsection will provide a quantum-mechanical exact
treatment of the same model.

having exhibited the explicit forms of the classical action and the constraints of the super
d-string, the next task is to construct a dual action out of them. the strategy for this purpose
is now standard, but for deniteness let us present the detailed exposition. as a rst step,
one needs to incorporate a lagrange multiplier eld h ij =  h ji into the classical action as
follows [15]:

s = zm2
+zm2

d2e 1

d2

1
2

2 q det(gij + e 1
h ij(fij  2iaj),

2 fij) +zm2

(c2 + c0f )

(16)

and then regard fij as an independent supereld. the equation of motion of ai gives rise to
i h ij = 0 whose classical solution is found to be h ij = ij with a constant scalar supereld
.

next, substituting this classical solution into the original action (16) gives us an action

s  = s1 + s2d, where

s1 = zm2
s2d = zm2

d2(cid:20)e 1

2 q det(gij + e 1

2 fij) +

1
2

( + c0)ijfij(cid:21) ,

(c2 + b2).

(17)

the important procedure to get a dual action is to solve the equation of motion obtained by
varying fij to express the action s  in terms of  instead of fij. note that since s2d does not

7

include fij in it, this part of the action is manifestly unaected by the duality transformation.
a simple calculation leads to

f01 = e

1
2 

 + c0

qe2 + ( + c0)2q det gij,

where we have used the formula holding for 2  2 matrices

det(gij + e 1

2 fij) = det gij + ef 2

01

= det gij +

1
4

e(ijfij)2.

(18)

(19)

it follows that inserting eq.(18) to s1 together with s2d yields the dual action of the super
d-string action

sd = zm2

d2e

1

2 qe2 + ( + c0)2q det gij +zm2

(c2 + b2).

(20)

we may interpret the dual action (20) in the following way.

if we regard the wess-

zumino term in (20), rm2(c2 + b2), as the source term for the ns-ns and the r-r 2-form
potentials, it turns out that this dual action carries the ns-ns charge  and the r-r charge
1 5. then provided that we identify the constant scalar supereld  = m with the ns-ns
charge corresponding to the (m, 1) string 6, the result obtained above, qe2 + (m  c0)2,
agrees with the tension formula for the sl(2, z) s-duality spectrum of strings in the type
iib superstring [31] 7. this identication means that the d-string action may be actually the
action for an arbitrary number of fundamental iib strings bound to a single d-string. this
singleness of d-string of course reects the u(1) character of the abelian gauge eld since
a system of n coincident dp-branes would be described by the non-abelian version of the
dirac-born-infeld action [32].

now let us examine the implication of eq.(20) in more detail and consider the exact
connection with the type iib green-schwarz superstring action. for that purpose we rewrite
the wess-zumino term in (20) in the form

= r(3) + ( + c0)h3

dd  d(c2 + b2)
= i e  ahe 1

1
2

e  abhe 1

2 i  ( + c0)e

2 ki e  ea

2 i + ( + c0)e

2 ki eb  ea,

5here we have used the fact that (b2,c2) is the sl(2, r) doublet as shown around the end of this section.
6see the next subsection about the reason why the scalar  becomes an integer m.
7for comparison of the string tension, we need to consider the string metric dened as g(s)

2 gij

1

ij = e

(21)

where gij is the einstein metric.

8

where eq.(15) was used. although the two matrices in the square brackets which are 2  2
2 q1 + ( + c0)2e2, these matrices are
hermitian matrices, have the same eigenvalues e 1
not mutually commutable so that they cannot be diagonalized simultaneously.

in the case of constant dilaton and axion the last term in (21) vanishes and the rst term
can be diagonalized by a suitable so(2) spinor-rotation. as a result, (21) can be written as

dd = e

1

2 qe2 + ( + c0)2i e   aea  ke .

from this form of the dual action, it has been concluded previously [11, 13, 7] that the dual
action of d-string is equivalent to the type iib green-schwarz superstring with the sl(2, z)

covariant string tension qe2 + ( + c0)2 [31]. but this argument is a little naive because

in this case we can change the string tension at will through the eld redenitions.

in the present formulation, however, we have to take notice of at least two problems in this
argument. firstly in the process of the diagonalization the so(2) spinor-rotation must be
accompanied by some associated sl(2, r) transformation of the background elds in order
to preserve the type iib supergravity constraint equations; namely type iib supergravity
equations of motion. secondly since in the general case of non-constant dilaton and axion the
last term in (21) does not vanish, two terms in (21) can not be simultaneously diagonalized
by some so(2) spinor-rotation.

it is remakable to see that these problems are closely related and resolved in the following

way. to do so let us rewrite (20) in the form

s 

d = zm2

d2e

1

2 q det gij +zm2

b
2,

where

1

2 

e

= e

b
2 = c2 + b2.

1

2 qe2 + ( + c0)2,

(22)

(23)

according to the sl(2, r)/so(2) coset description of dilaton and axion in type iib super-
gravity reviewed in appendix, eq.(23) is just the sl(2, z) transformation     = 1
associated with the sl(2, z) matrix

 +

s =

, (st )1 =

(24)

where (b2,c2) belongs to an sl(2, r) doublet which transforms like b in (a.11).
as discussed in appendix the type iib supergravity constraints are invariant under the
sl(2, r) transformation combined with some suitable so(2) spinor-rotation and therefore
b
2 satises the type iib supergravity constraint equation for the ns-ns 2-form. to compare
with the wess-zumino term of the type iib green-schwarz superstring action, let us take an

9

exterior derivative of the integrand in the wess-zumino term, which is calculated as follows:

d

d  db
= e

1

2

2 (cid:20)i e   aea  ke  +

1
2

e   abkeb  ea(cid:21) .

(25)

where e  and  are the so(2) spinor-rotated supervielbein and dilatino supereld, respec-
tively. the spinor-rotation angle is given by (a.17) and (24). thus it follows that the dual
action (22) is the type iib green-schwarz superstring action with the unit string tension,
t = 1 in the sl(2, r) transformed type iib supergravity background [30]. (note that this
sl(2, z) transformed background has the ns-ns charge  and the rr-charge 1.) in this
way the dual action (20) is precisely transformed into the type iib green-schwarz superstring
action by a sl(2, z) duality transformation (combined with a suitable so(2) spinor-rotation).
of course, this does not imply that the dual action (20) of the super d-string is equiva-
lent to the green-schwarz superstring action with the unit ns-ns charge, for the sl(2, z)
transformation is not a symmetry in the case of string theory, as opposed to d3-brane case.
instead, the above demonstration means that the dual action (20) is indeed nothing but the
type iib superstring action in a background with the ns-ns charge  and the rr-charge
1.
as alluded in section 1, in order to obtain this result, we have not adopted the conve-
nient technique for which the wess-zumino action containing the constant axion, which is a
topological theta term, is taken into account at the end of calculations in order to produce
the sl(2, z) covariant tension, instead treated its non-trivial wess-zumino action due to the
non-constant character of the axion eld from the beginning in a direct manner.

3.2 the quantum analysis

the results we have obtained in the previous subsection unfortunately rely on the classical
analysis in the sense that we have made use of the eld equations at least in the two stages,
namely, we have used the eld equations of ai and fij. now we are ready to present a
quantum-mechanical exact proof of sl(2, z) s-duality of the super d-string action in a general
ten dimensional iib supergravity background. (the results in this subsection were briey
reported in a short article [13].)

to this aim, let us utilize the rst-order hamiltonian form of path integral following the
techniques developed in [16, 33]. as a rst step of the hamiltonian formalism, let us introduce
the canonical conjugate momenta i corresponding to the gauge eld ai dened as

i 

s
 ai

,

(26)

where the dot denotes the time derivative. then the canonical conjugate momenta i are
calculated to be

0 = 0, 1 = e 3
2 

f01

q det(gij + e 1

2 fij)

+ c0,

(27)

where the former equation implies the existence of the u(1) gauge invariance. from the latter
equation a1 can be expressed in terms of 1 whose result is given by

a1 = e

1  c0

q(1  c0)2 + e2q det gij + b01 + 1a0.

then we will see that the hamiltonian density takes the form

(28)

(29)

h = e

1

2 qe2 + (1  c0)2q det gij  a011 + 1(a01) + 1b01  c01.

now the partition function is dened by the rst-order hamiltonian form with respect to

only the gauge eld as follows:

z =

1

r d0 z d0d1da0da1 exp iz d2(10a1  h)
= z d1da0da1 exp iz d2
(cid:20)a101 + a011  e

1

2 qe2 + (1  c0)2q det gij  1b01 + c01(cid:21) , (30)

where we have taken the boundary condition for a0 such that the surface term identically
vanishes. then we can carry out the integrations over ai explicitly, which gives rise to 
functions

z = z d1(01)(11) exp iz d2

(cid:20)e

1

2 qe2 + (1  c0)2q det gij + c01  1b01(cid:21) .

(31)

the existence of the  functions reduces the integral over 1 to the one over only its zero-
modes. if we require that one space component is compactied on a circle, these zero-modes
are quantized to be integers [34]. as a consequence, the partition function becomes

z = xmz

exp iz d2(cid:20)e

1

2 qe2 + (m  c0)2q det gij + c01  mb01(cid:21),

from which we can read o the eective action

s = z d2(cid:18)e

1

2 qe2 + (m  c0)2q det gij + c01  mb01(cid:19) .

(32)

(33)

note that if we replace m with  this action precisely becomes equivalent to (20). in this
way, we have derived the dual action of the super d-string action in a type iib on-shell
supergravity background geometry in quantum-mechanical exact manner.

to close this section let us present an interesting observation which will play an important
role especially in proving the self-duality of the super d3-brane action in sec.5. notice that
the original action (14) possesses the following two symmetries;

c0  c 
b2  b

0 = c0 + 1,
2 = b2, c2  c 

2 = c2  f = c2 + b2  f,

(34)

11

and

c0  c 
b2  b

0 = c0 + 1,
2 = b2, c2  c 

2 = c2 + b2,

(35)

which stem from the structure of the wess-zumino action. the super d-string action (14)
is exactly invariant under (34) and invariant only up to the topological term f under (35).
these symmetries do not aect the type iib supergravity constraints (15), which implies that
these are real symmetries of the theory. of course, it is obvious that the partition function
(32) is also invariant under these symmetries. noticing f = da the transformation (34) may
be interpreted as the transformation (35) combined with a gauge transformation of c2 whose
gauge parameter is the world-volume abelian gauge eld itself.

then it is natural to ask what the meaning of these symmetries is. in the following we
shall follow the notations in appendix. first, when we introduce the complex variable 
by  = c0 + ie, the shift of c0 corresponds to    + 1, being an element of sl(2, r)
associated with sl(2, r) matrix

(36)

next we should also investigate how this symmetry acts on the other superelds in the theory.
comparing the transformation (35) with (a.11), (b2,c2) is expected to form an sl(2, r)
doublet which transforms like b in (a.11). this statement is consistent with the result
obtained in the previous subsection and also supported in sec.5 by the fact that under the
weak-strong duality    1
it is illuminating that super d-brane actions in the general type iib supergravity back-
ground has a shift symmetry    + 1 as expected from the fact that this is a symmetry of
pertubation theory. this fact has been thus far understood in the target space approach where
the r-r scalar c0 appears only through its eld strength. but in the present world-volume
approach this comes from the non-trivial symmetry of the super d-brane action. we wish to
stress that it is possible to prove this interesting observation only in the present formalism
within the context of the world-volume theory as mentioned in sec.1.

 , (b2,c2) correctly transforms as an sl(2, r) doublet.

4 the super d2-brane

next we turn to the classical derivation of a duality transformation between the super d2-
brane (i.e., the super d-membrane) in a type iia supergravity background and the super
m2-brane in eleven dimensional supergravity. the authors in a paper [10] have already dealt
with this problem from a dierent viewpoint. the method adopted there is to start with the
super m2-brane in eleven dimensions, achieve the dimensional reduction to ten dimensions
a la kaluza-klein ansatz, then perform a duality transformation for the purpose of getting

12

the super d2-brane action and its -symmetry. our method is similar to that of aganagic
et al. [11] where the above arguments were reversed, namely, the super m2-brane action was
obtained from starting with the super d2-brane action through a duality transformation of
the world-volume gauge eld. the case of the constant or zero dilaton was already considered
in our previous work [7]. making use of the formulation explained in sec.2, we focus on the
problem of how our previous work should be extended to the case of the non-constant dilaton
supereld.

from eqs.(1) and (2), the super d2-brane action is of the form

s = sdbi + sw z + s h,

sdbi = zm3
sw z = zm3
s h = zm3

4 q det(gij + e 1

(37)

where we have added s h to the original action in order to perform a duality transformation.
moreover, in this case the constraints (11) on the eld strengths reduce to

h3 = db2 = ie

r(2) = dc1 = ie 3
r(4) = dc3 + h3  c1

4  e  abcec  eb  ea,

(38)

where (7), (8) and (9) were also utilized. of course, c1 and c3 are determined by solving
eq.(38).

varying ai in the action (37) gives the equation of motion, i h ij = 0 like the super d-
string case. then the solution is obviously given by h ij = ijkkb with b being a scalar
supereld. next, substituting this classical solution into the original action (37) leads to an
action s  = s1 + s2d, where

s1 = zm3
s2d = zm3

4 q det(gij + e 1

2 fij) +

d3(cid:20)e 1
(c3 + b2  db).

2

ijk(kb + ck)fij(cid:21) ,

(39)

since s2d does not include fij, it is manifestly duality invariant. solving the equation of
motion for fij in order to rewrite the action s1 in terms of b instead of fij, we arrive at the
dual action sd of (37)

sd = zm3

(40)

where we have dened as

(41)

incidentally, in order to derive the dual action we have used the mathematical formulas
holding for 3  3 matrices

det(gij + aiaj) = (det gij)  (1 + gijaiaj),
det(gij + fij) = (det gij)  (1 +

gijgklfikfjl),

(42)

eq.(41) implies the identication db+c1 = e 3

where fij = fji.
4 e11, in other words, identifying the world-
volume scalar with the coordinate of a compact extra target-space dimension. consequently,
the dirac-born-infeld action in eq.(40) takes the standard form for the induced metric of the
m2-brane. the remaining work is to show that the second term in the right hand side of
eq.(40) equals to the expression for the wess-zumino term of the super m2-brane. taking
the exterior derivative and using the relation (38) we can evaluate this term as follows:

dd  d(c3 + b2  db)

(43)

where a  (a, 11) denotes 11 dimensional index, and d1 and d2 are respectively dened
4  e 
as d1 = i
ab11eb ea  e11. accordingly, the dual action (40) of the super d2-brane can be written
as

8. in order to make (44) coincide with the super m2-brane action where
where g
there is no dilaton, we should remove the dilaton supereld except 2 by rescaling the other
superelds. it then turns out that the following rescaling makes a job

where d11 = i

12  e 
ab11eb  ea  e11. provided that we neglect the last term rm3  in the wess-zumino
action for the time being, this dual action is nothing but the standard form of the m2-brane
action [37]. thus, we have proved that the super d2-brane action in a type iia supergravity
background is transformed to the super m2-brane action with a circular compactied 11th
dimension in eleven dimensional supergravity background through a duality transformation
of the world-volume gauge eld as expected from iia/m-duality.

(46)

1

in fact, we can show the rescaling (45) that was required arises the well-known relation
between the dilaton and the radius of a compactied circle in the 11th direction as follows.
from eq.(41) and the rescaling, we have a relation

g11

ij = e 1

6 gij + e

4

3 (ib + ci)(jb + cj).

(47)

next in order to get the desired relation we have to rewrite the einstein metric gij in terms
of the string metric g(s)

2 gij whose result is given by

1

ij  e
g11

ij = e 2

3 g(s)

ij + e

4

3 (ib + ci)(jb + cj).

(48)

this correctly yields the relation between the 11 dimensional metric and the 10 dimensional
string metric [29]. particularly, the coecient in front of (b)2 gives us the relation that
r11 = e

3  [29], where r11 is the radius of a compactied circle in the 11th direction.

2

finally, let us comment the term rm3  in the wess-zumino action. since   1

2 as
dened in sec.2, this term never decouples from the theory unless the dilaton is a constant.
this fact is physically reasonable from the fact that  is the dilatino which is a superpartner
of the dilaton. thus, at rst sight, since the dilaton and the dilatino are contained, the
dual action (46) appears more general than the standard m2-brane action formulated in an
11-dimensional supergravity background whose bosonic elds are the metric and a 3-form
gauge potential. but this is illusory since it has been already shown [38] that by suitable
redenitions of the superconnection and parts of the supervielbein the terms involving the
dilatino can be set to zero in 11 dimensions. accordingly, we have precisely shown that the
dual of the super d2-brane action can be identied as the m2-brane action with a circular
11th dimension.

5 the super d3-brane

in this section let us show the sl(2, z) self-duality of the super d3-brane action in a general
type iib supergravity background with non-constant dilaton and axion in both classically and

15

quantum mechanically exact manner. in the case of non-constant dilaton and axion there
appear several new features as we will discuss in this section.

from eqs.(1), (2) and (3), the super d3-brane action is given by

s = sdbi + sw z,

sdbi = zm4
sw z = zm4

d4q det(gij + e 
(c4 + c2  f +

c0f  f ) = zm4

(50)

note that in the case of the non-constant dilaton and axion the abelian worldvolume gauge
eld enters into the axion term in the wess-zumino term only through the gauge invariant
and supersymmetric f . therefore this term is no longer a topological term and the symmetry
under the constant shift of the axion seems to be lost. however, as we will see in the next
subsection, it is this form of the wess-zumino action that ensures the ns-ns and the r-r
2-form potentials transform as a doublet under the sl(2, r) duality transformation.

5.1 the classical analysis

in this subsection we show that the super d3-brane action in a general type iib supergravity
background is classically self-dual. for this we rst add a lagrangian multiplier term [15]

s h = zm4

d4

1
2

h ij(fij  2iaj),

(51)

to the above action (49) and solve the equation of motion for ai by h ij = ijklkbl with a
dual vector potential bi. then substitution of this solution into the action (49) leads to an
action s  = s1 + s2d, where

s1 = zm4(cid:20)d4q det(gij + e 
s2d = zm4

(c4 + f  b2),

2 fij) + (c2 + f )  f +

1
2

c0f  f(cid:21) ,

(52)

16

where f = db.

next we solve the equation of motion for fij and substitute its solution into the action s .
following [15], we perform the calculation in the specic local lorentz frame where gij = ij =
diag(1, 1, 1, 1) and f has the following block diagonal form

fij =

f01

f01

.

(53)

then the action (52) is written in this local lorentz frame as

s  = zm4

d4[q(1  ef 2

01)(1 + ef 2
+ c0f01f23 + c0123 + f01b23 + f23b01].

23) + (c2 + f )23f01 + (c2 + f )01f23

solving the equation of motion for f01 and f23 yields

f01 =

(54)

(55)

(56)

inserting these solutions into the action (54) and returning to the general coordinate reference
frame, we arrive at the dual action sd in a simple form

(57)

now if we dene a new primed dilaton, axion and form-potentials which are of the form,

and

b
2 = c2, c 

2 = b2, c 

4 = c4  b2  c2,

17

(58)

(59)

then the dual action can be written as

f   f ),
4 + c 

2  f  +

(60)

where f  = f  b
2. the resulting action is completely the same form as the original action
(49) with which we have started. this means that under the transformations (58), (59) and

f  f, f  f ,

(61)

the action (49) and (60) are classically equivalent.

in order to establish the sl(2, r) self-duality of the super d3-brane action in a general
type iib supergravity background, we have to answer the following two problems. the rst
problem is to clarify the transformation properties of form-potentials under the sl(2, r)
duality transformation. the second one is whether the type iib constraint equations (50) are
preserved under the sl(2, r) duality transformation.

first of all, let us introduce complex variable  as in sec.3,

 = c0 + ie,

(62)

then the transformation (58) is written as     =  1
with the transformation matrix s = 

(a.10) and (a.11) the transformations (59) and (61) imply that (b2,c2) and ( f ,f ) are
expected to form sl(2, r) doublets which transform like b in (a.11) and a in (a.10), re-
spectively.

 , which is an element of the sl(2, r)

. according to the transformation rules

0
1
1 0




next we must nd the sl(2, r) element     =  + 1 which corresponds to the shift
of the axion c0  c0 + 1. it is easily shown that as in the super d-string action the super
d3-brane action (49) is invariant under the following two transformations

c0  c0 + 1,
b2  b2, c2  c2  f = c2 + b2  f,
c4  c4 +
f  f,

1
2f  f ,

and

c0  c0 + 1,
b2  b2, c2  c2 + b2,
c4  c4 +
f  f.

b2  b2,

1
2

18

(63)

(64)

2 f  f under (64).

the super d3-brane action (49) is exactly invariant under (63) and invariant only up to the
topological term 1
it is also easily shown that the type iib constraint
equations (50) are invariant under these transformation. thus the transformations (63) and
(64) are real symmetries of the theory. these transformations are also consistent with the
postulate that (b2,c2) and ( f ,f ) form sl(2, r) doublets which transform like b in (a.11)
and a in (a.10), respectively.
the transformation (63) is an exact symmetry of the theory and seems to be more at-
tractive than another one (64). it may be interpreted in such a way that there may exist a
manifestly self-dual formulation of the super d3-brane which are broken by some gauge xing
to the present formulation of super d3-brane action. unfortunately, however, as discussed
in the next subsection, the transformation (63) does not satisfy the consistency condition
of the constructive relation (71) in the next subsection. therefore we will not consider this
transformation any more in this paper.

at this point we should stress the following fact.

in the case of constant or vanishing

dilaton and axion the following form is sometimes taken as the wess-zumino action;

sw z = z (c4 + c2  f +

1
2

c0f  f ),

although this action is trivially invariant up to the topological term 1
2f  f under the shift of
the axion c0, the r-r 2-form potential c2 can not transform in such a way to form sl(2, r)
doublet with the ns-ns 2-form potential b2 and preserve the constraint equation on the r-r
5-form strength r(5). therefore with this wess-zumino action the sl(2, r) duality symmetry
would be lost even in the case of constant or zero dilaton and axion.
the general sl(2, r) transformations are generated by    1

 and    + 1. here we
recaptulate the sl(2, r) transformation rule for various elds in the theory for later use in
the next subsection. corresponding to the sl(2, r) transformation of the complex variable


    =

a + b
c + d

, ad  bc = 1,

which in terms of c0 and  is equivalent to

we dene the matrix s as

c 

0 =

(ac0 + b)(cc0 + d) + ace2

(cc0 + d)2 + c2e2 ,

s = 


a b

c d




, (st )1 = 


d c

.




19

(65)

(66)

(67)

then it is expected that f , f, b2, c2 and c4 transform in the following manner;

f  f  = a f  bf, f  c f + df,

b2  b

2 = db2 + cc2, c2  c 

2 = bb2 + ac2,

and

c4  c 

4 = c4 +

bd
2

b2  b2 + bcb2  c2 +

ac
2

c2  c2.

(68)

(69)

(70)

the transformation of c4 is determined by the requirement that r(5) is invariant under the
sl(2, r) transformations (64) and (68). the sl(2, r) transformations (65)-(70) are just
the same as those in [42], but the authors of [42] gave neither the transformation of c4 nor
so(2) spinor-rotation (a.16) since they considered only the bosonic d3-brane action. the
sl(2, r) transformation (70) of c4 and the so(2) spinor-rotaition (a.16) are indispensable
ingredients for the type iib supergravity constraints to be invariant under the sl(2, r) duality
transformation.

next we turn to the problem of the invariance (or covariance) of the type iib supergravity
constraints under the sl(2, r) duality transformation.
in appendix it is shown that all
the type iib supergravity constraint equations (of course including the torsion constraints)
are invariant under general sl(2, r) duality transformations (65), (69), (70) and the so(2)
spinor-rotation (a.16).

finally we note that, since the invariance under    + 1 holds only up to the topological
2f f , the sl(2, r) invariance of the theory would be broken to the sl(2, z) invariance

term 1
in a quantum theory.

5.2 the exact analysis

let us turn to the other analysis of duality condition which was initiated by gaillard and
zumino [39] and extended by several authors [40, 41, 42, 43].

let us dene the dual eld strength kij by the following constructive relation;

 k ij =

l
fij

,

fkl
fij

= i

l j
kj
l  i
k,

where the hodge dual components kij for the antisymmetric tensor kij are dened by

 kij 

1
2

kl
ij kkl,   kij = kij,

(71)

(72)

where ijkl is the levi-civita symbol in 4 dimensions, 0123 = 1 and the signature of gij is
(, +, +, +). at the classical level kij introduced here is equivalent to the dual variable  fij

20

in the last subsection. therefore it is natural to assume that (kij, fij) transforms as eq.(68);

for the innitesimal transformation with s = 




kij = +kij + fij, fij = fij + kij,

1  

it is given by

1 + 





(73)

the sucient condition for the consistency of the constructive relation (71), the invariance
of the eld equation and the invariance of the (world-volume) energy-momentum tensor under
the sl(2, r) duality transformation is that the following equation is satised for arbitrary
sl(2, r) parameters ,  and ;


4  k ijkij 


4  f ijfij 


2  k ijfij + l = 0,

(74)

where  means to take the sl(2, r) variation for all elds except the world volume abelian
gauge eld. this equation is derived by the similar argument in [43] where a similar equation
was derived for the special case of  = 0 and  =  (so(2) duality transformation). we
call eq.(74) the gaillard-zumino (g-z) duality condition.
in [43] it has been shown that the g-z condition is actually the necessary and sucient
condition in order that one can dene o-shell (non-local) duality transformation for the u(1)
gauge potential itself under which the action is invariant up to some surface terms. therefore
if one can show for an action to satisy the g-z condition, then one establishes the exact self-
duality of the theory described by this action without resort to any classical approximation.
it has been shown that the super d3-brane action on a at [44], an ads5  s5 [23] and a
general type iib supergravity backgrounds with constant dilaton and axion [7] indeed satises
the g-z condition.

in this subsection we show that the d3-brane action on the most general type iib super-
gravity background described by the action (49) and constraints (50) satises the g-z duality

(a.16).

before we enter the detailed discussions we should note that the transformation (63) does
not satisy the consistency condition for the constructive relation (71). the consistency
condition of the constructive relation demands the equation

  k ij =

,

to be satised. a simple calculation leads us to a contradictory result; f ij = 0. it seems to
be curious that the exact symmetry of lagrangian does not satisfy the consistency condition.

the super d3-brane lagrangian (49) in terms of component elds is written as

l = ldbi + ijkl(

eq.(85) ( coecient) is almost trivially satised. eq.(84) ( coecient) is also easily

shown to be satised, using the following identity

(88)

this is the only equation which explicitly depends on the specic form of ldbi . using
the explicit expression (76) for ldbi , it is easily shown that the equation (87) is satised.
therefore we have shown that the super d3-brane action (49) in the most general type iib
supergravity background indeed satises the gaillard-zumino duality condition.

in [44] it has been shown that the super d3-brane action in a at background with constant
dilaton and axion which satises the gaillard-zumino condition is pseudo-invariant under the
sl(2, r) (non-local) duality transformation of the world-volume abelian gauge eld in both
the lagrangian and the hamiltonian formalism. according to the theorem proved in [43]
our above result strongly suggests that the super d3-brane action in the most general type
iib supergravity background is also exactly self-dual without resort to any semi-classical
approximation. it would be an interesting problem to establish it in both the lagrangian and
the hamiltonian formalism.

6 the super d4-brane

in this section let us start with the super d4-brane action and perform a duality transforma-
tion of the world-volume gauge eld to reach the action obtained by the double-dimensional
reduction of the super m5-brane [45, 46]. the method we consider is analogous to the one
adopted in section 4, so we shall follow a similar path of argument as in the super d2-brane.
like the super d2-brane, the analysis in this section is purely classical.

this time, from (1) and (2) the super d4-brane action with a lagrange multiplier term

becomes

as usual, we take the variation with respect to ai, which gives rise to the solution h ij =
6ijklmkklm with k = db with b being a second rank tensor supereld. after substituting
this solution into the action, we obtain the action s  = s1 + s2d where s1 and s2d are dened
as

(91)

with h = k + c3. as before, s2d is unaected under a duality transformation. therefore
a duality transformation amounts to solving the equation of motion for fij in s1 in order to
rewrite the action in terms of b (or its eld strength k) instead of fij. following the formula
in ref.[11], it is tedious but straightforward to derive the dual action sd = s1d + s2d where
s1d is given by

now let us turn our attention to s2d. the conditions (90) yield the equation

where d1 and d2 are respectively dened as the rst plus second terms independent of the

(95)

as in the case of the super d2-brane in sec.4, we can also set rm5 2 to be zero in terms of

redenitions of the superconnection and the supervielbein. with this situation, if the dilaton
is vanishing, this dual action of (95) exactly reduces to our previous action [7], while if the
dilaton is vanishing and the background is in a at minkowski spacetime, it becomes the
action considered in ref.[11]. then it is straightforward to show that each action is identical
to its corresponding action which is obtained by the double-dimensional reduction of the super
m5-brane [45, 46] after rearranging the constant dilaton factor in a suitable way. following
the similar line of argument, it turns out that the double-dimensional reduction of the super
m5-brane action coincides with the dual super d4-brane action even in a general type iia
supergravity background under consideration as suggested by the duality between m-theory
and iia superstring theory.

7 discussions

in this paper, we have studied the properties of a duality transformation of super dp-brane
actions (p = 1, 2, 3, 4) in a general type ii on-shell supergravity background, which have
been constructed in refs.[8, 9, 10]. they have already been investigated in the case of a
at background with the zero or constant dilaton and axion [11] and in a type ii on-shell
supergravity background with the zero or constant dilaton and axion [7]. our presentation in
this paper is most general compared to the previous approaches so we believe that we have
succeeded in showing that various duality symmetries in the super d-brane actions are indeed
valid in a general type ii supergravity background geometry.

the main motivation of the present paper was to take account of the non-constant dilaton
and axion superelds in carrying out a duality transformation of the super d-brane actions.
to the best of our knowledge, this is the rst attempt and consequently gives us several new
fruitful results and insights as shown thus far. in particular, from the viewpoint of the world-
volume eld theory we have succeeded in showing that the dilaton and the axion as well as the
two 2-form gauge elds, those are, the ns-ns 2-form and the r-r 2-form, are doublets of the
sl(2, r) mobius group whereas the graviton and the 4-form gauge potential are singlets in
the einstein metric. these facts are of course familiar to us but have been so far proved only
in the target space formulation while our presentation is purely from the world-volume eld
theory. the main new issue in the theory at hand is the existence of a non-trivial symmetry
corresponding to a shift of the modulus eld  . the discovery of this symmetry enables
us to prove the expected duality relations of the super d-brane actions under the sl(2, r)
transformation, in particular, the self-duality of the super d3-brane action.

moreover, it was shown that the dual actions of the super d2-brane and d4-brane actions
on a iia supergravity background with the constant dilaton, respectively, have the standard
forms which are expected from the dimensional reduction of the m2-brane and the m5-brane
actions on the 11 dimensional supergravity background. note that the dilaton and the dilatino
appear in 10 dimensional spacetime through the kaluza-klein compacication on a circle from
the m2- and m5-brane actions in an 11 dimensional supergravity background.

of course, in this paper our considerations have been focused on only the super d-brane
actions [8, 9, 10], thus a detailed comparison between the formulation at present and the
other approaches treating dierent forms of the p-brane actions [25, 26] certainly merits
further investigation in trying to clarify a number of non-perturbative aspects of d-brane
theory.

in the last section in a paper [11], it is stated that ...... for the most part, our analysis
has been classical and limited to at backgrounds. the results should not depend on these
restrictions, however. in our pevious paper [7], we have relaxed these restrictions to some
extent, while in this paper, we have removed such restrictions completely for the super d1-
brane and d3-brane. on the other hand, for the super d2-brane and d4-brane we have
removed the restriction of at background, but we have presented only the classical analysis.
this restriction should be also removed in future. but as emphasized in the previous paper [7],
it is not always clear for us whether it is necessary to remove this restriction or not since the

26

dp-brane actions with p > 1 are in essence unrenormalizable so these actions might describe
the low energy eective theory of some underlying renormalizable theory. this problem still
deserves further investigation.

appendix

sl(2,r) coset construction of dilaton and axion

in type iib supergravity the dilaton and the axion describe the coordinates of sl(2, r)/so(2)
coset manifold. in this appendix we briey review the sl(2, r)/so(2) coset description of
the dilaton and the axion in the type iib supergravity.

by construction v in (a.1) is the sl(2, r) matrix which transforms the origin of the coset

which transforms covariantly under sl(2, r) transformation m  m  = smst . then one
