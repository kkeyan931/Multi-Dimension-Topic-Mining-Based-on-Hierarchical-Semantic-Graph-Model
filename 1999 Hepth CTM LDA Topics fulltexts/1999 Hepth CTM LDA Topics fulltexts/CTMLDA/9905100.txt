(1) regard zero-modes 4 components gauge elds higgs scalars, avoid quadratically divergent quantum corrections higgs boson masses thanks higher- dimensional gauge symmetry. previous work, 1) considered qed model d1 s1 space-time took zero-mode d-th component gauge eld higgs scalar. calculated also quantum mass correction d-th component gauge eld. result conrmed disappearance quadratic divergence. we, however, found nite mass correction higgs remains, generally proportional inverse s1 radius. although gauge hierarchy problem original sense solved, quadratic divergence disappeared, several issues settled scenario realistic. address following two important issues. (i) toy model 4 s1, higgs mass mh experiences nite generally large quantum correction provided radius s1 small gut planck length. 1) issue make nite correction mh small, approximately comparable weak scale. (ii) toy model 4 s1 higher dimensional qed. u(1) gauge symmetry, therefore, spontaneously broken, even though higgs d-th component photon eld non-vanishing vacuum expectation value (vev). simply higgs eld electrically neutral, appears possibility break gauge symmetry, theory extended non-abelian gauge (yang-mills) theory, higgs behaves adjoint representation gauge group. regard rst issue above, already discussed possibilities settle problem previous work. 1) rst rather trivial possibility assume large compactication scale tev1. 2) 3) interesting note large scale compactication attracted revived interest, partially inspired progress 2 superstring/m theories. 4) second possibility utilize heavy electron mass satises ml 1 (l: circumference s1). correction mh suppressed roughly exp(ml)/l. (here exp(ml) corresponds boltzmann factor nite temperature eld theory.) also pointed nite mass mh regarded coming sort aharonov-bohm eect s1 space may disappear compactied space simply-connected manifold. conrmed expectation toy model s2, showing mh identically vanishes. main purpose paper settle remaining second issue mentioned above. theories s1 extra space, constant background vev gauge elds physical meaning wilson loop, dynamically xed minimization eective potential functions background elds. thus yang-mills theories vev behave vev adjoint higgs, generally break gauge symmetry spontaneously: so-called hosotani mechanism. 5) obtain realistic gut-type theories, starting higher-dimensional yang-mills the- ories, quite important study gauge symmetry dynamically broken hosotani mechanism. particular, interested question breaking pattern gauge symmetry depends choice representation (fundamental adjoint ) matter elds. extensively study point considering two representative gauge groups, su(2) su(3). bonus also nd interesting property theory, concerning rst issue mentioned above. namely, realize cases curvature curve potential function identically vanishes, leading mh = 0. noted vanishing mh obtained arbitrary compactication scale without introduction simply-connected space like s2. 1) 1.2. gauge symmetry breaking matter representation hosotani mechanism briey review history investigation gauge symmetry breaking via hosotani mechanism, particular case d1 s1 space-time conguration. 1983, hosotani found gauge symmetry may break system su(n) gauge theories 3s1 space-time. model order break gauge symmetry, necessary many (more 16 avors) complex scalar elds matter eld non-trivial boundary conditions matter elds, = /2. 5) later became obvious case fermions belong fundamental representation su(n) gauge group, gauge symmetry never broken. 1989, found su(2) gauge symmetry breaking possible fermions adjoint representation, 6) 7) shown pattern gauge symmetry breaking depends congruency class representation gauge group. 7) 8) 3 many works done along direction, giving hope using hosotani mechanism possible mechanism gut symmetry breaking. scenario investigated extent. 9) 10) however, case theory contains fun- damental adjoint representations fermions never investigated, except e6 model ref. 7) supersymmetric models. 12) 13) partially motivated works supersymmetric models attempt study non-supersymmetric version gauge symmetry breaking via hosotani mechanism theories fundamental adjoint matter. 2. dynamical gauge symmetry breaking extra dimension 2.1. eective potential consider su(n) gauge theories d1 s1 space-time fundamental adjoint fermionic elds. lagrangian given l = 1 2 trf n fm n + nf xj=1 f,jim dm f,j + nad xk=1 ad,kim dm ad,k, (2) fm n = n + ig, dm f = f + igt aaa dm ad = ad + ig, = aa a, (3) (4) (5) f(ad) fermions fundamental (adjoint) representation, nf (nad) avor numbers dirac fermion fundamental (adjoint) representation. indices n run 0 1 (whereas run 0 2) j k avor indices. color index omitted here. use x coordinates d1 s1, respectively. boundary conditions s1 taken a(x, + l) = a(x, y), f (x, + l) = eif f(x, y), ad(x, + l) = eiadad(x, y), (6) (7) (8) l compactication scale s1 subspace related radius s1 l = 2r. 4 eective potential separated three parts: 9) 10) v g+gh e = (d 2) e + v f = v g+gh e + v ad e , n (d/2) xn=1 xi,j=1 d/2ld e = nf 2 (d/2) v f xi=1 xn=1 d/2ld e = nad 2 (d/2) v ad xi,j=1 xn=1 d/2ld n n cos , , nd nd cos cos nd .
