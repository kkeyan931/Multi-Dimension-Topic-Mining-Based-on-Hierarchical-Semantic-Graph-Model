(2) take associated 4 4 quantum r()-matrix well known solution related sine-gordon model, nontrivial elements given  r11 11 = r22 22 = a(), r12 12 = r21 21 = b(), r12 21 = r21 12 = c, expressed trigonometric functions spectral parameters a() = sin( + ), b() = sin , c = sin . hand, choose lax operator ancestor model (3) (4) l(anc) () = c+ 1 eis3 + 1c1 eis3 2 sin s+ c+ 2 eis3 + 1c2 eis3 ! , 2 sin = ei. (5) ca central algebra (1) relation = 1(c+ 1 c2 c1 c+ 2 ). derivation algebra (1) follows directly qybe inserting explicit forms lax operator (5) r-matrix (3) matching dierent powers spectral parameter . therefore algebra (1) various realizations eect becomes equivalent qybe guarantees quantum integrability model constructed it. establish (1) hopf algebra show following characteristics known coproduct (x) : a, antipode : counit : k, along multiplication : unit : k hold algebra (1). taken together denes hopf algebra. deriving objects exploit another inherent property qybe, namely product two lax operators lajlaj+1 well l1 aj represent also solutions qybe indicating inherent hopf algebra structure. using lax operator (5) therefore derive coproducts explicit form (s+) = c+ 1 eis3 s+ + s+ c+ 2 eis3 (s3) = s3 + s3 , (s) = c2 eis3 , (ci ) = ci ci . + c1 eis3 (6) inserting coproducts algebraic relations (1) one prove easy steps algebra also true tensor product expressed (6). hopf algebra property key obtaining ybe relations global object i=1 li(): r12( ) () () = (i () i() r12( ). turn derives t() = trt () quantum integrability condition  = 0.

(9) simplest representation ~s = 1 2~ derives integrable xxz spin chain , (5). hand, representation (7) corresponding reduction (8) g(u) = 2 recovers quantum exact lattice sine-gordon model  2 sin  lax operator obtained directly (5) cs = 1 ( compatible = 0, + = 1). 1 1 another unusual lie algebra generated (1) xing eigenvalues cs 2 = 0 correspond values = 1. gives c+ 1 = c2 = 1, exponentially deformed lie algebra c1 = c+  = e2is3 2i sin . (10) 1 2 reduces (8) g(u) = (1+ei(2u+1)) . lax operator (5) values cs 2 sin explicit form g(u) clearly yields exact lattice version quantum liouville model . note present values may achieved even c1 6= 0, giving algebra (since (1) depends ) hence realization. however, lax operator depends explicitly cs gets changed reducing (5) another nontrivial structure. interesting possibility constructing systematically dierent useful lax operators model. example, present construction second liouville lax operator recovers easily , invented involved way bethe ansatz solution. 2 = 1, c1 = iq, c2 = hand bit asymmetric choice eigenvalues: leading + = 2sin , = 2icos may use another realization c+ 1 = c+ q s+ = a, = a, s3 = n, = i(cot ) 1 2 , (11) reduces (1) directly well known q-oscillator algebra :  = a,  = a,  = cos((2n + 1)) cos . (12) note direct derivation q-oscillator algebra possible obtain quantum algebra uq(su(2)). another interesting point that, coproduct structure (6) casimir operators (ci ) = ci ci clearly contradicts present values ca , = 1, 2, leads q-oscillator algebra (12). provides perhaps unexpected argument q-oscillator algebra lacks hopf algebra structure. thus constructed new quantum integrable q-oscillator model, physical model also obtained. using realization (7) (8) simplied g2(u) = q mapping bosonic 2 , n = u,  = 1, express q-oscillator operators: = eip((s u)) standard bosons = ( q 2 , n = . converts integrable q- oscillator model bosonic model representing exact lattice version quantum derivative nonlinear schrodinger equation (qdnls)  (5) yielding corresponding lax operator. qdnls shown related interacting bose gas derivative -function potential . fusing two models one create integrable massive thirring model described . 2n cos ) 1 1 since quadratic algebra allows also trivial eigenvalues m, may choose even = 0. note case may achieved dierent sets eigenvalues c i) c+ 1 = 1, rest cs zeros. sets values lead underlying algebra = 1 , = 1, 2, ii) c1 = 1, iii) c+  = 0,  = s. (13) however, may generate dierent lax operators (5) due explicit dependence c. particular, case i) leads light-cone sg model, ii) iii) give two dierent lax operators found   relativistic toda chain. also seen examples constructing dierent convenient lax operators liouville model. present case (8) gives simply g(u) =const., therfore interchanging canonically u ip, p iu, (7) yields (14) s3 = ip, = eu ancestor lax operator generates evidently discrete-time relativistic quantum toda chain. 3.2 models belonging rational class covering wide range models trough reductions ancestor model various free parameters inbuilt it. one deformation parameter q = e, kept generic trigonometric class. consider undeformed limit q 1 equivalently 0 generating isotropic nonrelativistic models belonging rational class examine structure main objects scheme gets suitably modied. immediate existence limit central elements along generators must dependent. consistent procedure leads is, + m+, m, 1 + reducing (1) algebraic relations  = 2m+s3 + m,  = (15) 1c0 2, = c1 m+ = c0 2 new central elements. see lie qda, since multiplicative operators removed general due allowed zero eigenvalues. moreover, algebra (15) also hopf algebra coproduct structure 2 + c0 1c0 1c1 (s+) = c0 (c0 ) = c0 1 s+ + s+ c0 c0 , (c1 2, (s) = c0 + c1 c1 2 + c0 c0 ) = c0 1, (s3) = s3 + s3 (16) giving (m+) = m+ m+, (m) = m+ + m+. unusual feature (15) observed (17), though undeformed algebra noncocommutative nature. ancestor lax operator (5) limit 0 converted naturally lr() = c0 1( + s3) + c1 1 s+ c0 2( s3) c1 2 ! , (17) rational dependence spectral parameter quantum r-matrix (3) reduced also rational form a() = + , b() = , c = , (18) well known nls model . therefore integrable systems associated algebra (15) generated ancestor model (17) would belong dierent class, namely rational class, sharing rational r-matrix (18). corresponding models, examples listed appendix, nonrelativistic isotropic type. interesting nd 0 operator function (8) putting = 0 gives 2 , using inter-bosonic map reduces g0(u) = i((s u)(m+(u + + 1) + m)) representation (7) generalized holstein-primakov transformation (hpt) 1 s3 = n, s+ = g0(n), = g0(n), g2 0(n) = + m+(2s n), n = . (19) checked exact realization (15) associated lax operator (17) therefore may considered integrable generalized lattice nls model. may serve ancestor model rational class. generating rst standard homogeneous models choose constant eigenvalues casimir operators. one choice m+ = 1, = 0, reduces (15) clearly su(2) algebra, spin 1 2 representation gives xxx spin chain  lax operator (17). bosonic realization (19) case simplies standard hpt g2 0(n) = (2s ), reproducing known lattice nls model  (17). complementary choice m+ = 0, = 1, hand converts (19) simply s+ = , = , s3 = n due g0(n) = 1 reduces (15) directly oscillator algebra  = ,  = ,  = 1. (20) (17) realization generates another simple lattice nls model . remarkably, trivial choice = 0 gives algebra (13) therefore realization (14) found relativistic case also used nonrelativistic toda chain . related lax operator associated rational r-matrix, however obtained (17). noted bosonic realization general lax operators like (5) (17) found also earlier works . 4 field models classical models required, ancestor model apart discrete quantum systems obtained above, capable also constructing integrable family quantum eld models well classical discrete eld models dierent limits. obtaining quantum eld models start respective lattice versions constructed scale lattice operators pj, uj, ca , j, consistently lattice spacing . continuum limit 0 one would obtain eld operators pj p(x), j (x) etc. along commutation relations like  = jk  = (x y). corresponding lax operator l(x, ) continuum model obtained discrete counterpart lj() + il(x, ) + o(2). associated r-matrix however remains same, since contain lattice constant . thus integrable eld models like sine-gordon, liouville, nls derivative nls models obtained (see appendix) discrete variants constructed above. classical limit h 0, eld operators converted ordinary functions commutators reducing poisson brackets. note h enters r-matrix scaling factor h elements, turn determine structure constants algebraic relations. therefore ancestor algebras (1) (15) converted poisson algebras r-matrix classical form: r() = + h() + o(h2). however basic scheme remains almost same. remarkably, quantum parameter enter lax operators explicitly therefore form ancestor lax operators (5) (17) remains form also classical limit. therefore use reductions ancestor models generating classical model success. 5 inhomogeneous models mentioned ancestor model (5) undeformed variant (17) containing non- trivial casimir operators used constructing new class integrable inhomogeneous models. eigenvalues casimir operators chosen site dependent, general time dependent functions. notice sine-gordon model unlike coupling constant mass parameter enters casimir operator underlying algebra. therefore taking + j = (mj)2, one construct variable mass (in general time dependent) discrete sg model without spoiling integrability. continuum limit would result novel variable mass sine-gordon eld model hamiltonian h = z dxhm(x, t)(ut)2 + (1/m(x, t))(ux)2 + 8(m0 m(x, t) cos(2u))i , (21) may arise also physical situations . inhomogeneous lattice nls model obtained considering site-dependent values central elements (17) generalized hpt (19). possible quantum eld model may correspond equations like cylindrical nls  explicit coordinate dependent coecients. similar way inhomogeneous versions liouville model, (non)relativistic toda etc. constructed. example, taking ca j nonrelativistic toda chain get new integrable inhomogeneous quantum toda chain hamiltonian 1 ca (pj + h = xj c1 j c0 j )2 + 1 c0 j c0 j+1 eujuj+1. (22) note inhomogeneities removed gauge transformation variable change, inhomogeneity ca j time-dependent functions. another way constructing inhomogeneous models use dierent realizations al- gebras (1) (15) dierent lattice sites, depending type r-matrix. may lead even dierent underlying algebras hence dierent lax operators diering sites opening possibilities building various exotic inhomogeneous models. example, may possible construct hybrid models sine-gordon liouville elds, x 0 would follow sine-gordon dynamics, x < 0 liouville dynamics. dierent possibilities model constructions dealt elsewhere. similarly nontrivial examples impurity xxz (or xxx) spin chains obtained, replace standard lax operator single impurity site ancestor model (5) (or (17)) representations (in spin, q-oscillator boson). would give rise integrable quantum spin chains impurity various nature, might physical signicance. spin hamiltonian impurity would look like h = ( xj6=m,m1 lxxx(0) jj+1(lxxx(0))1 jj+1 + ld(0) mm+1lb(d))1 mm+1 +ld(0)mm1(lxxx(0) m+1m1lxxx(0)1 m+1m1)ld(0)1 mm1) lxxx() ld() correspond spin impurity lax operators, respectively. lax operator bosonic impurity may derived (17) lb m() = ( nm) + 3 2 1 ! . (23) 6 concluding remarks thus prescribed unifying scheme constructing integrable systems, cov- ers quantum lattice well eld models relativistic anisotropic (with q 6= 1) nonrelativistic isotropic models (with q = 1) along corresponding classical counterparts. models generated systematically single ancestor model underlying algebra (1). general using freedom choosing eigenvalues casimir operators appearing algebra site well time dependent functions, obtain inhomogeneous quantum integrable models constituting new class. lax operators descendant models constructed (5) q 1 limit (17), variety concrete representations obtained general form (7) dierent realizations. corresponding underlying algebraic structures allowed reductions (1). asso- ciated quantum r-matrix descendant models however remains trigonometric rational form inherited ancestor model. answers mystery wide range integrable models found share r-matrices. fact also shows intimate relationship among descendant models inspite seemingly wide external dierences reveals universal character solving models algebraic bethe ansatz (aba) , elements associated r-matrix plays major role. 7 appendix: well known examples quantum inte- grable models lax operators 7.1 models associated trigonometric r-matrix i) field models 1. sine-gordon model utt uxx = m2 sin(u), l = ip, sin( + u), sin( u) ip ! .
