quantization of 4-dimensional nambu-goto theory of open string in light cone gauge,
related in lorentz-invariant way with the world sheet, is performed. obtained quantum
theory has no anomalies in lorentz group. determined spin-mass spectra of the theory
have regge-like behavior and do not contain the tachyon. vertex operators of interaction
theory, acting in the physical subspace, are constructed.

it is well known, that quantization of string theory creates anomalies, destroying
classical symmetries of the system. exception is a theory at critical value of space-
time dimension d = 26, where the anomalies are absent. to construct 4-dimensional
quantum string theory, required in physical applications, one usually introduces
additional degrees of freedom (such as fermion elds, propagating along the world
sheet), whose contribution cancels the anomaly at less number of dimensions. this
approach can be combined with another idea: some of dimensions can be considered
as coordinates on a compact manifold of physically negligible size.

there are also other methods of string quantization, which do not introduce
extra dimensions or extra degrees of freedom, but use non-standard canonical bases
in the phase space of hamiltonian mechanics as a starting point for quantization.
such methods were applied in works 1,2 for quantization of special subsets in the
phase space, representing particular types of the world sheets. distinctive features
of these 4-dimensional theories are absence of anomalies in lorentz group and non-
xed intercept in spin-mass spectrum, which gives a possibility to remove tachyon
from the theory. due to these features, the given approach can be used for a
construction of relativistic models of hadrons 3.

in this work we will try to extend the methods 1,2 for the world sheets of general

form. for this purpose we use a denite modication of light cone gauge.

light cone gauge relates a parametrization of the world sheet with some light-like
vector (gauge axis), see g.1. in standard approach this vector is non-dynamical,
e.g. n = (1, 1, 0, 0...). because the lorentz-transformations change the position of
the world sheet respective to this xed axis, they are followed by reparametrizations

of the world sheet. on quantum level the reparametrization group has anomaly,
which appears also in lorentz group and violates lorentz covariance of the theory.
this is a main problem of string theory in standard light cone gauge.

the simple idea how to avoid this problem is to connect the gauge axis with
some dynamical vector in string theory. in this case the lorentz-transformations
move the gauge axis together with the world sheet, and the parametrization on
the world sheet is not changed. lorentz group in this approach should be free of
anomalies.

implementation of this idea includes the following ingredients.

geometrical description of the world sheet 4. lets introduce a function,
related with strings coordinates and momenta by expressions

the curve, dened by the function q() (further called supporting curve) has the
following properties:

1. the curve is light-like: q2() = 0, this property is equivalent to virasoro con-
straints on oscillator variables;
2. the curve is periodical: q( + 2)  q() = 2p ;

3. the curve coincides with the world line of one string end: x(0,  ) = q( ); the
world line of another end is the same curve, shifted onto the semi-period: x(,  ) =
q( +  )  p ;
4. the whole world sheet is reconstructed by this curve as follows: x(,  ) = (q(1)+
q(2))/2, 1,2 =   , see g.2;

d a()  a() is an orbital moment of the string in cmf (further
called spin). the last expression can be written in terms of oscillators ak and can
be interpreted as constraints :

si = skek

the obtained symplectic form corresponds to the following poisson brackets:

{si, sj} = ijksk, {si, ej

n} = ijkek
n.

(8)

algebra of constraints belongs the 1st class: {0, i} = 0 , {i, j} = ijkk.

thus, the string is equivalent to a mechanical system:

p, z + innite set of oscillators ak, ak + the top ei, s,

restricted by 4 constraints of the 1st class, which include mass shell condition and
requirements of the form spin of the top is equal to the spin of the string. con-
straints generate reparametrizations of the supporting curve: 0 generates shift of
argument q()  q( +  ) (evolution of the string, see appendix 2); i generate
the rotations of basis ei with respect to non-moving supporting curve.

in more details: 3 rotates e1 and e2 about e3 and simultaneously rotates
coecients of supporting curve decomposition in opposite direction, so that sup-
porting curve is not changed: {3, q()} = 0. constraints 1,2 generate the ro-
tations of basis, changing the direction of the gauge axis n , and they are fol-
lowed by reparametrization of the supporting curve. in the oscillator variables this
reparametrization looks like a complicated nonlinear transformation.

generators of lorentz group are dened by expression 1

they generate lorentz transformations of a coordinate frame (n 0

the conguration is decomposed with scalar coecients. thus, m generate rigid
lorentz transformations of the world sheet, not changing its parametrization. lorentz
generators are in involution with constraints: {m, 0,i} = 0.

lorentz generators are simple functions of variables (z, p, s), which in our
approach are independent,
their quantum commutators are postulated di-
rectly from poisson brackets. as a result, in quantum mechanics the commutators
[m, m], [m , q] are anomaly free. this can be proven by direct calculation,
done in 1.

i.e.

the algebra of constraints i in quantization acquires the same anomaly that
earlier was in lorentz group. thus, our current result is just a transfer of anomaly
from lorentz group to the algebra of constraints. however, now we have more
freedom to solve the problem, because we can impose additional gauges, excluding
anomalous component in the algebra of constraints. gauges relate the position of
gauge axis with other dynamical vectors in the system.

lets direct e3  s  s1 = 0, s2 = 0. these gauges are in week
gauge 1:
involution with 0,3 , and are the gauges only for 1,2. they are equivalent to 2nd
class constraints onto oscillator variables: a = 0, {a+, a} = 2is 6= 0. the
reduction of oscillator symplectic form onto the surface of these constraints leads
to a form of complicated structure. this structure becomes simple for a denite
restricted class of congurations.

congurations with axial symmetry. lets consider supporting curves, whose
projection to cmf has axial symmetry of order 2 (see g.3).

supporting curve and the world sheet
fig.3.
with axial symmetry of order 2 (both are pro-
jected to cmf). computer generated image 5.

this restriction is equivalent to annulation of all even oscillator variables: a2n =
0, a2n = 0, n  z. on the surface of this restriction the constraints a = 0 are
satised identically, because all terms in the sum p 1
k akanak+n vanish (if k, n are
odd, then k +n is even). reduction on the surface of all constraints will give poisson
brackets:

{z, p} = g, {ak, an} = ikkn,
{si, sj} = ijksk, {si, ej

1} = ijkek
1,

(9)

the dierence from the general case (8) is that indices of oscillator variables here
are odd, and (s, e1) represents the mechanics of the rotator: se1 = 0, (e1)2 = 1
(instead of the top in general mechanics). remaining constraints: 0 = p 2/2 
l0, 3 = s  a3 are of the 1st class. as in general mechanics, 0 generates the evo-
lution q()  q( +  ) and 3 does not change the conguration: {3, q()} = 0.

6 string theory in lorentz-invariant light cone gauge

quantization of this mechanics is straightforward. canonical operators

[z, p] = ig, [ak, a+
[si, sj] = iijksk, [si, ej

n ] = kkn, k, n odd,
1] = iijkek

k |0(cid:11) = 0, k < 0)a onto the space of functions (p, e1), with denition of opera-

possible to construct the operator q(), which satises all necessary requirements:
is nite, hermitian and commutators [q(), 0,3] repeat classical poisson brackets
(see 2 for details).

general congurations in gupta-bleulers approach; (  +0).

remark: general congurations in gupta-bleulers approach. we considered the
mechanics of restricted congurations. for general congurations one should deal
with a complicated mechanics, appearing in the reduction on the 2nd class con-
straints a = 0. however, its possible to construct self-consistent quantum theory
by methods, deviating from standard diracs procedure. for example, lets replace
two 2nd class constraints by a single constraint: a = 0 (a1,2 = 0)  aa+ =
2 = 0. in quantum theory we will have aa+|(cid:11) = 0  (cid:10)|aa+|(cid:11) = 0,
1 + a2
a2
and in positively dened space we are using this is equivalent to a+|(cid:11) = 0  the re-
additionally we have the constraints (sa3)|(cid:11) = 0, (p 2/2l0)|(cid:11) = 0, the
whole set of constraints belongs to the 1st class. moreover, because l0 = p|k|nk,

at any xed value of p 2/2 the mass shell condition denes nite-dimensional sub-
space, where other constraints act as matrices of nite size. its easy to resolve the

sult coincides with gupta-bleulers imposition of hermitian conjugated constraints.

a such fock space is positively dened, and occupation number operators nk = : a+
values: 0,1,2...

k ak : /|k| take

string theory in lorentz-invariant light cone gauge

correspondent linear systems (see appendix 3) and nd the spectrum, shown on
g.4, right.

its necessary to understand, that the described method is dierent from diracs

approach, where imposition of constraint |(cid:11) = 0 should imply, that physical

states are invariant under the action of a gauge transformations, generated by .
in our case the replacement of two 2nd class constraints by their sum of squares
gives a degenerate constraint, which generates no transformations.

this method of constraints imposition has some physical ground. lets consider
a simplest example of 2nd class constraints: x = 0, p = 0. the diracs reduction
completely eliminates these 2 degrees of freedom. if we replace these constraints by
a single one: x2 + p2 = aa = 0, after an appropriate choice of quantum ordering

we will have a constraint a+a|(cid:11) = 0, dening the vacuum state, where x, p are
distributed by gaussian function with the dispersion h. taking h  0, we will have
the same situation, as in classical theory.

realization of 2nd class constraints by a single constraint ala gupta-bleuler is
widespread in literature (example is the method of string quantization, which was
proposed by rohrlich 6 and then was extensively used for a construction of hadrons
models, see 7). we, however, want to use purely diracs methods and now will try
to quantize the theory in another gauge.

gauge 2, general congurations:

lets direct e3  s  s3 = 0. replacing
the constraints s  a = 0 by equivalent combination |s+| |a+| = 0, arg s+ 
arg a+ = 0, we see that s3 = 0 is a gauge only to the last constraint (it generates
phase rotations of s+), and is in involution with others.

reduction leads to a mechanics, dierent from general one (8) by a replacement:
the top ei, s  the rotator e3, s. mechanics includes three 1st class constraints:
a+a = 0. first two constraints generate phase
p 2/2  l0 = 0, a3 = 0, s 
rotations of oscillator variables: an  anein , an  anei , and a+a is a poly-
nomial of an, an with such structure, that it is conserved in these phase rotations.
because this property can be easily preserved in quantization, the quantum algebra
of constraints will be free of anomalies. conguration a() has a form:

a() = (cid:16) 

2s (a()a+n + c.c. )

(10)

2p 2 (cid:16) p 2
2p 2 (cid:16) p 2

2 + |a()|2(cid:17) , 1
2  |a()|2(cid:17) e3(cid:17) ,

+ 

where n = (s is e3)/s. as earlier, mass shell condition generates the evolution
q()  q( +  ) and {a3, q()} = 0 (a3 rotates the phases of a() and a+ in op-
a+a = 0 generates
posite directions and conserve a()a+). the constraint s 
the rotations of gauge axis about spin vector, and correspondent reparametrizations
of the supporting curve.

p-reection operation can be dened in this mechanics, consisting of two factors:
 :
performed by a replacement an  a

reection of the supporting curve w.r.t. a plane, perpendicular to s, which is

n  a()  a(), a+  a;

so that a()  a().
remark: in gauge 1 the gauge axis was directed along the spin, which is not changed
in p-reection. thus, the gauge axis is not changed also. as a result, p-reection
changes a position of the supporting curve w.r.t. gauge axis and is followed by
reparametrization. this makes problematic the denition of p-reection in gauge 1.

quantization. canonical operators:

n ] = kkn, k, n  z/{0}, [si, sj] = iijksk, [si, ej

[z, p] = ig, [ak, a+
where se3 = 0, (e3)2 = 1. realization is analogous to presented above. opera-
tors a, dened by the same polynomial expressions as in (7), have no ordering
ambiguities. three constraints:

3] = iijkek
3,

(p 2/2  l0  )|(cid:11) = 0, a3|(cid:11) = 0, (cid:16)s p(a+a + aa+)/2 (cid:17)|(cid:11) = 0

belong to the 1st class. symmetric ordering under the square root in the last
constraint was chosen, because it commutes with p-reection, dened as follows:

p = r, r = eis,  = {ak  a+
 a+ = a, a+a = aa+.

k} = {|nk(cid:11)  |nk(cid:11)}

again, at xed p 2/2 the mass shell condition denes nite-dimensional sub-
space, where other constraints act as nite matrices. its easy to solve the eigenvalue
problem for these matrices (see appendix 3).

the main obstacle now is that operators a still have the anomaly in com-
mutator. if they would not have anomaly, the denition of the square root t =

p(a+a + aa+)/2, analogous to s = ps2 + 1/4  1/2  s2 = s(s + 1) will

give integer spectrum for t . but now a have anomaly and do not represent the
rotation group. the spectrum of t is not integer (even in s-like denition), see
g.5. due to the constraint s  t = 0, s  z, t / z the theory becomes empty.
this problem (anomaly in spectrum) is absolutely dierent from the usual one

(anomaly in commutator). the following solution can be proposed.

generally we can add to t any operator, which commutes with all constraints,
and whose contribution is classically vanishing (e.g. eigenvalues of t are bounded
by plancks constant: |ti| < const  h). the corrected variable will have the same
classical limit as t . with the aid of these corrections we can deform the spectrum
of t to integer values. there is an innite number of possible deformations, the
simplest one: shift eigenvalues of t to the closest integer value below. because we
dont change the eigenvectors of t , the constraints remain to be of the 1st class
(t acts in the subspaces, dened by other constraints). redenition changes t
by operator, whose eigenvalues are restricted between 0 and 1, or when we restore
plancks constant  between 0 and h. therefore, the corrected operator t has the

string theory in lorentz-invariant light cone gauge

9

same classical limitb. after the redenition t  [t ] we have spin-mass spectrum,
shown on g.5, right.

remark: leading regge trajectory (starting from the vacuum state l0 = 0) is seem-
ingly absent in the spectrum. this eect, of course, can be explained as anomaly-
induced nonlinearity of the leading trajectory ti(l0) (g.5, left). however, there
are arguments, why the leading trajectory really should be absent in this approach,
see appendix 4.

s+1/2 (sise3e3/2), see 8. conguration opera-
tor is nitec, hermitian and satises the relations: [a(), l0] = ia(), [a(), a3] =
0.

anomaly can appear in commutator [a(), s  t ]d. in classical mechanics the
poisson bracket {a(), s  t} is a complicated non-linear expression of indepen-
dent variables, and we have the ordering ambiguity in denition of correspondent
quantum expression. in principle, one can try to preserve this commutation relation
by an appropriate choice of ordering procedure, or by classically vanishing correc-
tions of simplest denition (11). however, now we will show, that anomaly in this

b quasi-classical approximation also gives integer values for t spectrum (t is action-type variable,
generating 2-periodical evolution).
cmatrix elements of this operator between states with nite number of excited modes are nite.
dbecause there are anomalous operators under the square root in t , and because we perform
redenitions t  [t ].

10 string theory in lorentz-invariant light cone gauge

commutator is not crucial for the theory, because in spite of this anomaly, we are
able to construct the vertex operators, acting in the physical subspace.

operators a() themselves do not act in the physical subspace: a()|phys(cid:11) 6
|phys(cid:11), due to [a(), l0] 6= 0. vertex operators are their special combinations.
for example, emission of photons from the charged ends of string is described by
operator 8: v  = r 2
2 : a()eikq() : if initial and nal states satisfy the mass
shell condition p 2/2(p k)2/2  z, this operator acts in the physical subspace.

have the right evolution operator equal to unity, and r 2
to the space with 0 = 0. as a result, we obtain physical state | (pk)2
(eikq(0) includes eikz operator, shifting p  p  k).
straint  = s  t : v  = r 2

in analogous way we can dene the vertex operator, commuting with the con-
2 v ( ), v ( ) = ei v ei . the  -dependence
of v ( ) corresponds to the rotations of gauge axis about spin (transformations,
generated by ), and we average v  by these rotations. however, in classical me-
chanics v  is parametric invariant (constant on  ), consequently, v ( ) = v  +
f ( ), where all  -dependent terms are f ( ) = o(h). therefore, the constructed ver-
tex operator v  classically corresponds to the same variable v  (changes, performed
by insertion of evolution operators and averaging are o(h)). now it acts in the phys-

conclusion. we have constructed a quantum theory, which acts in 4-dimensional
space-time, does not have anomalies in lorentz group and algebra of constraints,
and in classical limit represents nambu-goto string theory. we considered 3 variants
of this theory:

1. quantization of axially symmetrical world sheets (g.4, left);

2. quantization of general world sheets by gupta-bleulers procedure (g.4, right);

3. quantization of general world sheets by diracs procedure (g.5, right).

in the rst two cases the quantum theory has no intrinsic diculties. in the third
case there is anomaly in spectrum of an operator t , entering into one of the con-
straints. to obtain non-empty theory, we should perform classically vanishing cor-
rections of this operator. these corrections are ambiguous, only one variant was

appendix 1: symplectic structure of the phase space 1,9.
in modern formulation of hamiltonian mechanics the phase space is dened as a smooth manifold,
endowed by a closed non-degenerate dierential 2-form  = 1
2 ijdxi  dxj (in some local coor-
dinates xi, i = 1, . . . , 2n). poisson brackets are dened by the form as {xi, xj} = ij , where
kijk is inverse to kijk: ijjk = k
i .
lets consider a surface in the phase space, given by the 2nd class constraints: (x) = 0 ( =
1, . . . , r), detk{, }k 6= 0. reduction on this surface consists in the substitution of its explicit
parametrization xi = xi(ua) (a = 1, . . . , 2n  r) into the form:

 =

1
2

abdua  dub, ab =

xi
ua

ij

xj
ub

,

detkabk 6= 0.

matrix kabk , inverse to kabk, denes poisson brackets on the surface: {ua, ub} = ab.
this method is equivalent to commonly used dirac brackets formalism. sometimes it is
convenient to combine both methods: some of the constraints (x) are imposed as above, then
dirac brackets on the remaining constraints n(u) are calculated by denition:

{ua, ub}d = {ua, ub}  {ua, n}nm{m, ub},

where knmk is inverse to knmk: nm = {n, m}.
plectic form  =r 

in string theory canonical poisson brackets {x(), p ()} = g (  ) correspond to sym-
d p()  x(). it can be transformed to the form (4) by a substitution
of expressions for x(), p() in terms of q(); and then to the form (6) by substitution of light
cone parametrization for q().

spin part of the form s = 1

2 dei  d(s  ei) corresponds to poisson brackets (8). to prove
this, at rst invert coecient matrix of the form, ignoring orthonormality constraints eiej = ij ,
then calculate diracs brackets on the surface of these constraints.

considering gauge 1, we substitute e3 = s/s, e2 = e3  e1 into the form and nd s =
de1  d(s  e1). correspondence of this form to poisson brackets (9) can be proven analogously.
for gauge 2 we use the following property of symplectic form.

about e3 to align the rst axis along s: ei = r(3)

tion s3 = 0, the additional term d  ds3 = 0. the resulting
form can be transformed to s = dn3  d(s  n3), n3 = e3:
the top (ei, s) is replaced by the rotator (e3, s). replacement
ei  ni in the expression for conguration (5) transforms it
to (10).

appendix 2. geometrical reconstruction of the world sheets

properties 1,2 of supporting curve follow from its denition. property 3 follows from 4 and 2.
lets prove the property 4:

x(,  ) = (q(1) + q(2))/2,

1,2 =   .

(12)

this formula was obtained in 4 by direct solution of hamiltonian equations in q-representation.
here we will reproduce the proof of this formula in oscillator representation.

hamiltonian of the system is an arbitrary linear combination of virasoro constraints: h =
p cklk (lk = pn an
, ck = ck). coecients ck inuence only parametrization of the
world sheet. the choice h = l0 corresponds to conformal parametrization (where (x  x)2 = 0).
this hamiltonian generates phase rotations an
(0)ein and shifts x( ) = x(0) +
(p/) . using (3), we see that the evolution of function q() is the shift of its argument:
q(,  ) = q( + , 0). then, using (2), we have the following evolution for coordinates and
momenta:

( ) = an

x(,  ) = (q( + , 0) + q(  , 0))/2,

p(,  ) = (q( + , 0) + q(  , 0))/2.

introducing isotropic coordinates 1,2 =   , obtain formula (12).

remark: using poisson brackets (4), we have {q(), q2()/4} = (  )q(), and for
h = r d f ()q2()/4 :
q() = {q(), h} = f ()q(), linear combinations of con-
straints generate shifts of points in tangent direction to the supporting curve, or equivalently 
reparametrizations of this curve.
1. taking f = 1, we will obtain the evolution q()  q( + ) and formula (12) again.
2. considering arbitrary f , we will see that the reduced phase space of string (obtained in factor-
ization of the phase space by the action of gauge group) is actually a set of all possible supporting
curves, which are considered as geometric images, without respect to their parametrization (two
dierent parametrizations of the curve correspond to the same point of the reduced phase space).
all physical observables in string theory are parametric invariants of supporting curve. the world
sheet is also reconstructed by the supporting curve in parametrically invariant way, see g.2.

gauge 1, gupta-bleulers approach. fig.7 shows the
spectrum of operators (l0, a3). due to the constraint
s  a3 = 0, s  0, we should consider only the upper
part of this spectrum: a3  0.
operator a+ acts on the level l0 = const and
raises a3 by 1.
it annulates all states on leading
trajectory l0 = a3 (among them |l0 = 0, a3 =
0(cid:11) and |l0 = 1, a3 = 1(cid:11)). for the states with
0  a3 < l0, l0  2 the multiplicity of states
on the level n (l0, a3) has a property n (l0, a3) 
n (l0, a3 + 1). the remaining part of consideration
is a proof (done by direct computation), that matrices
ij = (cid:10)l0, a3 + 1, i|a+|l0, a3, j(cid:11), representing lin-
a+
ear map a+ : (l0, a3)  (l0, a3 + 1), have maximal
rank (equal to less dimension n (l0, a3 + 1)). there-
fore, this linear map has a kernel with the dimension
k(l0, a3) = n (l0, a3)  n (l0, a3 + 1). (particu-
larly, the linear map (3, 1)  (3, 2), marked by arrow
on g.7, has exactly 1-dimensional kernel.) comput-
ing k(l0, a3) for the whole spectrum g.7, we obtain
the spectrum g.4, right. then we solve the linear
equations a+
ijj = 0, and place the result in table 2.

appendix 4: singularity on leading regge trajectory.
lets consider the projection of supporting curve in cmf and parametrize it by its length: q(l).
in this parametrization dq0/dl = |dq/dl| = 1 (consequently, total length of the curve is equal
to double mass of the string). lets consider a point on the supporting curve, in which tangent
vector dq/dl is directed opposite to the gauge axis e3, see g.9. in the vicinity of this point the
following expansion is valid: dq/dl = t + n(l  l) + o((l  l)2), where t = dq/dl = e3

is unit tangent vector to the curve in the point q(l), and n = d2q/dl2  e3 is a major normal
to the curve in this point. thus, the expansion of (dq0/dl + dq3/dl) starts from (l  l)2.
on the other hand, in light cone gauge (5) dq0/d + dq3/d = dl/d (dq0/dl + dq3/dl) =
p 2/ = const, therefore dl/d  (l  l)2  (l  l)  (  )1/3. then dq0/d =
dl/d  ()2/3, dq3/d = p 2/dq0/d  ()2/3, and (dq1/d)2+(dq2/d)2 =
2p 2/  dq0/d  p 2/2  (  )2/3.

singularity of light cone gauge.

thus, the light cone gauge parameter-
izes the supporting curve irregularly in
the vicinity of point q(). at   
the components of tangent vector q()
tend to innity: q0,3() as ()2/3,
and q1,2() as (  )1/3. this type
of singularity is integrable, it does not
create any problems for classical theory.
particularly, masses of such congura-
tions are nite. however, such cong-
urations require an innite number of
excited modes in fourier expansion of
a() = q1()  iq2(). this makes
problematic a consideration of such con-
gurations in quantum theory, where
the states with nite mass necessarily
have nite number of lled modes.

for string theory in d = 4 the described singularity is not crucial, because the alignment of
q()  e3 can be removed by a small deformation of the curve, so the congurations with such
singularity are rare in the whole phase space. (this singularity is a real obstacle for d = 3. in
2-dimensional cmf such alignment cannot be removed by a small deformation, and most of string
congurations become innite-modal in light cone gauge.)

in the case, if the gauge axis is selected perpendicular to the spin (gauge 2), the described
singularity appears on the leading regge trajectory. leading trajectory corresponds to circular
supporting curves (straight strings 1), and for any direction of the gauge axis, perpendicular to
the spin, a point on the circle exists with tangent opposite to the gauge axis. this singularity is
a possible reason for disappearance of the leading trajectory in quantization.
