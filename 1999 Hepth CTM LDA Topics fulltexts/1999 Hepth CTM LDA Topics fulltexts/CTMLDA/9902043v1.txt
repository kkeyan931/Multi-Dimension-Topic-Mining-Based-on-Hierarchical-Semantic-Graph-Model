abstract

we present a calculation of the matrix theory 2-loop eective action for a d0-
brane in the background of the recently discussed d0-d6 bound state conguration.
the eective dbi action of a d0-brane probe in the background of the corresponding
4-dimensional non-supersymmetric black hole solution to low-energy type iia string
theory compactied on a 6-torus is known to agree with the matrix theory calculation
at 1-loop order, in the limit in which the ratio of the d0-brane to the d6-brane charges
carried by the black hole is large. agreement at 2-loop between the supergravity
description and a conjectured nonabelian bdi eective superyang-mills description
has also been recently reported. however, we nd uncanceled ultraviolet divergences
in our direct matrix theory calculation of the 2-loop eective action. this is consistent
with the expected nondecoupling of massive open string states from the 6-brane.

1 introduction and summary

recently several authors have discussed a non-supersymmetric conguration of d0- and d6-
branes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] in the context of supergravity/superyang-mills correspondence
conjectured by matrix theory [8]. these studies have uncovered many interesting features
of this brane conguration. this conguration appears as a classical solution in (6+1)-
dimensional superyang-mills theory [2]. the energy spectrum of the conguration with
arbitrary number of d0- and d6-branes [6], which is labelled by the corresponding ramond-
ramond charges, turns out to be identical to the mass spectrum of a non-supersymmetric
extremal black hole solution to the classical equations of low-energy type iia string theory
compactied on a six-torus down to 4-dimensions [9, 10, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14]. this is surprising
because in the absence of supersymmetry in this system one would have expected the weak
coupling gauge theory result for the energy spectrum to get modied in the strong coupling
regime corresponding to supergravity. furthermore, the conguration has been studied with
various brane probes and agreement has been found at the 1-loop level between matrix theory
and supergravity calculations [3, 4, 5, 6, 15], in the limit of large zero to six brane charge ratio.
in this limit, a d0-brane scattering o this conguration is dominated by d0-d0 scattering
and this is what explains the agreement between the two calculations of the v4 terms in the
1-loop eective action, even in the absence of supersymmetry in this system. however, the
agreement of the v2 and constant (v-independent) terms in the eective action is dicult to
understand since these terms manifestly represent the supersymmetry breaking interactions
between d0- and d6-brane . recently, a 2-loop calculation for a d6-brane probe using the
eective superyang-mills action of chepelev and tsyetlin [16] has also been reported [17] to
be in agreement with the corresponding supergravity calculation at 2-loop . these results
are surprising not only because the conguration is non-supersymmetric but also because
one does not expect the bulk to decouple from the 6-brane. it is, therefore, of interest to ask
whether the agreement at 2-loop level persists in a direct matrix theory calculation.

in this paper we present a direct calculation in the matrix theory framework of the
2-loop eective action of a d0-brane probe in the background of the d0-d6 bound state
conguration. we nd uncanceled divergences in the matrix theory calculation. these
divergences seem to be related to the ultraviolet divergences one might expect in a (6 + 1)-
dimensional eld theory. this result, which is expected [18, 19], makes the agreement found
in [17] all the more intriguing.

the present work draws heavily on [6] and should be regarded as a sequel to that work.
we will follow the conventions and notations of this reference. we also refer the reader
to this work for all the background material which we will need here. the organization of
this paper is as follows. in the next section we rst briey discuss the d0-d6 conguration
given in [6] and then give the terms in the matrix theory action, expanded around this
conguration, which are relevant to the 2-loop calculation. in section 3 we give the various
2-point functions needed for the calculation. the calculation of the 2-loop eective action
is presented in section 4. in section 5 we discuss the origin of the uncanceled divergences in
the 2-loop eective action. we end with some concluding remarks in section 6. expressions
for the various terms in the 2-loop eective action are collected together in the appendix.

2 the matrix theory action

in this section we will expand the matrix theory action around the d0-d6 background
conguration discussed in section 5 of [6], and briey reviewed below, and obtain the terms
relevant for a 2-loop calculation. the matrix theory action is

s =

+it i[xi, ] + 2tc dtc  2[c , bi][xi, c](cid:27)

[xi, xj]2  ( dta)2 + t dt

(2.1)

the notations and conventions are the same as in [6].

background conguration

the d0-d6 background conguration consists of multiple d6-branes with the d0-branes

appearing on them as magnetic uxes. we present this conguration below:

here, the entry in the lower right corner is a single-element one. this entry is reserved for
the probe d0-brane . for a single d6-brane, [qa, pa] = ica, a = 1, 2, 3. for multiple parallel
d6-branes, the qas and the pas have a further structure:

qa =

assumed to be large since we will be neglecting the eect of winding modes.

a , etc. the d6-branes are wrapped on t 6 with volume v6 which is

a ] = ic(1)

a , p (1)

the q6 d6-branes are organized into four sets, each consisting of n d6-branes , where
4n = q6. each d6-brane in the rst set carries magnetic uxes (f45, f67, f89) = (f, f, f ).
the d6-branes in the other three sets carry the magnetic uxes (f,f,f ), (f,f, f )
and (f, f,f ). here f is the parameter which is related to the ratio of the d0-brane to
in view of the above, a more suitable notation
d6-brane charge in the bound state [6].
a , p m
for the qas and pas is q
]

 to be independent of .
moreover, the four triplets of numbers {ca
 )  ~c correspond to the four triplets
of uxes listed above and so we may write

a , where  = 1, 2, 3, 4 and  = 1, 2,   , n and [q

. for the desired conguration we need ca

 , c2

 , c3

~c = c~, ~1 = (1, 1, 1), ~2 = (1,1,1), ~3 = (1,1, 1), ~4 = (1, 1,1).

(2.2)

agreement with supergravity at 1-loop requires c = f 1  0.

the only nonzero entry in the above matrices is in the lower right corner. here v is the
velocity of the d0-brane, assumed to be moving along the x1 direction, and b is the impact
parameter.

fluctuations

there are basically two dierent types of uctuations that we need to consider. the
rst type are the ones with nonzero entries only in the last row or column of the various
matrix variables. these represent open strings connecting the probe d0-brane to the branes
in the background. these type of uctuations are the only ones that contribute at the 1-loop
level. we shall call them column type uctuations. the other type of uctuations have
nonzero entries everywhere other than the last row and the last column. these matrix
type uctuations represent open strings connecting the various branes in the background.
they do not contribute to the 1-loop eective action, but do contribute at 2-loop level and
beyond. we have done the 2-loop computation in the limit of a large number of d6-brane
in the background conguration, i.e. for large values of q6. the uctuation in the bottom
right corner entry in the various matrix variables can be ignored for the leading contribution
in this limit. this is what we have done in the following.

action for fluctuations

the action (2.1) may now be expanded around the background bi. it is convenient to

write the result as follows:

s = sbgd + s2 + sint.

(2.3)

here s2 is the part of the action quadratic in uctuations and sint is the part containing
interactions. furthermore, it is convenient to write

s2 = sx+a

in the above, h.c. stands, as usual, for hermitian conjugate. also, we have dropped all
terms that either do not contribute to the 2-loop eective action of the probe d0-brane in
the leading large q6 limit or contribute terms that do not depend on the impact parameter
b and the velocity v of the probe.

note that in the notation we have used for the background, a term like, for example,

3 two-point functions

there are two dierent kinds of 2-point functions corresponding to the two dierent kinds
of uctuations, namely column type uctuations i, a, , c and c and matrix type
uctuations zi, za, z and zc. one minor complication in both the sectors is that there
is mixing at the quadratic level, so the propagators cannot be immediately read-o from
the quadratic action, s2, and a rediagonalization is needed. furthermore, to obtain explicit
expressions for the 2-point functions, it is necessary to use an explicit representation for
the heisenberg algebra, [q
in the limit c  0, we may use the
representation in terms of functions of 3 real variables, one for each of the three values
of the index a. we will denote these three real variables by the triplet ~x  (x1, x2, x3).
note that in terms of there variables the explicit form for a term like, for example, tr z 2
is

,m=1 pn
(~x, ~y,  )|2. we will now list below all the nonzero 2-point

4 the two-loop eective action

there are basically two types of 1pi diagrams that contribute to the eective action at the
2-loop level. diagrams of the type shown in fig. 1 involve two 3-point vertices and diagrams
of the type shown in figs. 2 and 3 involve a single 4-point vertex. in these diagrams the

fig. 1

fig. 2

fig. 3

thin lines represent column type propagators and the thick lines represent matrix type
propagators. diagrams of type figs. 2 and 3 are easier to evaluate and so we compute these
rst.

diagrams involving a 4-point vertex

diagrams involving two 3-point vertices

it is convenient to group these diagrams, fig. 1, into sets such that each set has only one
type of matrix propagator joining the two 3-point vertices. thus, we have diagrams with only
matrix ghost propagator, etc. we now give below the contributions of the dierent sets. note
that to arrive at the expressions listed below we have made extensive use of the symmetry
properties of the various 2-point functions with respect to their arguments as well as their

(4.1)(4.15).

5 ultraviolet divergences in the 2-loop action

at low velocities and for small values of the parameter c, on general dimensional grounds we
expect the 2-loop eective action to be a double series of the following form:

2loop =

b11
v

+ a2b7v + a3b3v3 + d1

v5
b

+   !

+ a5b3v + d2

v3

+   !

+ d3

+   !

+d4

+   

(5.1)

here the quantities a1,   , a6 and d1,   , d4 are pure numbers and  is dened in the ap-
pendix in (a1). the structure of (5.1) follows from the observation that, as dened in (2.1),
the parameter g has dimensions of [length]3. moreover, b2, v and c all have the dimensions
of [length]2 and the leading term in the 2-loop calculation goes as 1/vc6.

12

the terms in (5.1) with coecients a1,   , a6 all have positive powers of b with them.
on physical grounds all these coecients should vanish since they would otherwise give rise
to a potential that diverges at large distances. the terms with coecients d1,   , d4 all give
rise to a potential that goes as 2, where 2 = b2 + v2 2. this is precisely the structure of
the leading terms, in the limit c = f 1  0, of the 2-loop eective potential calculated using
the dbi action, given in (6.11) of [6]. for agreement with matrix theory, the coecients of
these terms must match between these two calculations.

we have calculated the various terms in (5.1) using the results presented in the ap-
pendix.3 we nd that while indeed a1 = 0, all the other coecients have uncanceled diver-
gences. for example, for the term proportional to v/c6, we get

(5.2)

similar ill-dened expressions are obtained for all the other terms. since the general structure
of all the terms is similar to (5.2), let us see in some detail where the two type of terms in
(5.2) originate.

consider the second term in (5.2) rst. the structure of this term suggests that it
originates from z, (a6). there is actually another contribution to this term which comes
from those terms in the sum of (4.3)(4.15) which are proportional to b2. to see this, let us
write the total eective action at 2-loops as

ds2 eb2(s1+s2)x(s1, s2)

ds3 eb2s1y (s1, s3),

(5.3)

w, x and y can be read-o from the results given in the appendix. let us now explicitly
separate out the b2 piece in w :

w (s1, s2, s3) = (s1, s2, s3) + b2u(s1, s2, s3).

(5.4)

the b2 terms come only from diagrams like fig. 1 containing a matrix gauge or bosonic
propagator. so the quantity u(s1, s2, s3) can be read-o from the sum of (4.5)(4.15). an
explicit expression for it is given in the appendix in (a21). now, using the identity

b2eb2(s1+s2) = 

1

(s1 + s2)eb2(s1+s2),

3extensive use of mathematica was made in these calculations.

expanding in powers of 1/c, to leading order we get

1 s7/2

3

sinh vs1)1(51 + 13 cosh 2vs1  64 cosh vs1) + 0(1/c4).

(5.10)

now, further expanding this in powers of v, we see that the order v1 term vanishes, but
all the higher powers of v have nonvanishing coecients. in particular, the order v/c6 term
exactly reproduces the second term in (5.2).

the trick employed in (5.5) has a diagramatic representation. in terms of diagrams like
fig. 1, the second term in (5.5) results from shrinking one of the column type propagators

14

to a point (large b2 or small s expansion). doing this to fig. 1 produces diagrams of the
type shown in fig. 2, and hence there is mixing of these two types of contributions, as we
have seen above.

the divergence in the second term in (5.2) comes from small values of the proper time
variable, and this suggest that they are ultraviolet in nature. this can be seen more directly
as follows. we have seen that this divergence has basically to do with diagrams of type fig.
2. a typical contribution of such a diagram is

z d z d3~xz d3~yz d3~z (~z,  ; ~x,  )(~x, ~y,  ; ~z, ~y,  ).

(5.11)

in writing (5.11) we have ignored the various indices since they are not relevant to the present
discussion. now, introducing the momentum space representation for the matrix propagator,

(~x, ~y,  ; ~x, ~y,  ) = z

where

d3~k

(2)3 z d

i~k(cid:16) ~x+~y

e

+~y

2 (cid:17)i(  ) (, ~k, ~x~y)(3) ((~x  ~y)  (~x  ~y)) ,

which can be obtained from (3.15), we may rewrite (5.11) as

(, ~k, ~x)  h2 + ~k2 + ~x2i1

,

d3~k

(2)3 z d

(2)3 z d

2 z d3~y (, ~k, ~y)

(cid:20)z d z d3~x (~x,  ; ~x,  )(cid:21) .

the rst factor looks like a massless bosonic loop in 7-dimensional space-time, which is
ultraviolet divergent. the divergence in the second factor can also be seen to be coming
from the high frequency oscillators in the energy representation of this integral.

in a similar fashion one can see that the divergences in the rst term in (5.2) are ultraviolet
in nature. this term receives contributions from diagrams of the type shown in fig. 1 as well
as those in fig. 3. the general structure of the contribution of the former type of diagrams,
after integrating over the proper time variable s3 associated with the matrix propagators,
is exactly like those of the latter type of diagrams. in fact, integrating over s3 eectively
shrinks the matrix propagator in fig. 1, thus producing the diagram in fig. 3. a typical
contribution of these latter type of diagrams is

z d (cid:20)z d3~x(~x,  ; ~x,  )(cid:21)(cid:20)z d3~y(~y,  ; ~y,  )(cid:21) .

it is clear from this expression that high frequency uctuations produce the divergences seen
in the rst term in (5.2).

we have discussed above in detail the origin and the structure of the divergences in the
coecient a2. similar general discussion applies to the coecients a3,   , a6 and one nds
that these coecients are also ultraviolet divergent. somewhat more work is required for

15

the coecients d1,   , d4. this is because in a naive double expansion in powers of 1/c and
v, the integrals over the proper time variable s3 in the dierent contributions to the 2-loop
eective action diverge at the large s3 end. this happens essentially because the matrix
propagators are massless, i.e. there is no factor of eb2s3 in the integrand. the correct
procedure is to rst integrate over s3 and then perform the double expansion. once this is
done, one nds that the coecients d1,   , d4 are also ultraviolet divergent.

6 concluding remarks

in this paper we have presented the results of a calculation of the 2-loop eective action for
a d0-brane in the background of the recently discussed d0-d6 bound state conguration.
as we have seen, the 2-loop eective action has uncanceled ultraviolet divergences. similar
ultraviolet divergences are potentially present in the calculation of the 1-loop eective action
also. however, in that calculation, done in the proper time representation like the present
calculation, the divergent parts precisely cancel in the sum of contributions from dierent
sectors (boson, fermion, gauge and ghost), leaving behind a nite answer for the 1-loop
eective action. in general, one expects matrix theory loop calculations to be divergent for
the present background because of nonrenormalizability of 7-dimensional gauge theory. the
ultraviolet divergent 2-loop result that we have got is consistent with this expectation. since
a full string theory calculation is expected to be ultraviolet nite, this means that massive
open string states do not decouple from the 6-brane, as expected from general considerations
[18, 19].

one of our motivations for the present calculation was the surprising supergravity/superyang-

mills agreement at 2-loop found in [17]. in view of our result and the above considerations,
it now seems even more surprising that a simple 2-loop eective superyang-mills action
should reproduce the supergravity result. presumably the eective superyang-mills action
can be obtained from a full string theory calculation.
it would be nice to have a better
understanding of this.
