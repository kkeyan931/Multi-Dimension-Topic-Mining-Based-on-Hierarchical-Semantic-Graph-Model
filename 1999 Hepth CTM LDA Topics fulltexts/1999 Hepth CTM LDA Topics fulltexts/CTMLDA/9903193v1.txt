abstract

simple derivation of the hamilton-jacobi equation for bosonic strings and p-branes
is given. the motion of classical strings and p-branes is described by two and p+1 local
elds, respectively. a variety of local eld equations which reduce to the hamilton-
jacobi equation in the classical limit are given. they are essentially nonlinear, having
no linear term.

dynamics of point particles can be described by the hamilton-jacobi (hj) equation.
it is a rst-order partial dierential equation, given by (s)2 = m2 for a free relativistic
particle. the hj equation can be viewed as the classical limit of quantum eld equations.
the klein-gordon equation (h22 + m2) = 0 or the dirac equation (ih  m) = 0
reduces to the hj equation with the ansatz   eis/h or   eis/h.

the argument can be reversed for strings and p-branes. we attempt to rst nd the

classical hj equations for strings and p-branes, then use them as a guide to nd quantum

string and p-branes equations. in particular, establishing the hamilton-jacobi equation

for classical superstrings would serve as a big step for an ultimate formulation of quantum

superstrings.

the hamilton-jacobi equation for strings has been discussed for many years.[1]-[8]

rinke and kastrup have given the hj equation for strings, though their derivation being

rather invloved. for point particles the hj function s(x) can be identied with the action

of trajectories ending at x. such identication is not applicable to strings. the purpose

of this letter is to give simple derivation of the hj equations for bosonic strings and

p-branes, and to propose local eld equations which reduce to the hj equations in the

classical limit. we believe that the simplicity and clarity of our derivation enhance the

usefulness of the hj equation.

we start with the nambu-goto action for strings:

where v = (x, x )/(, ). in terms of covariant momentum tensors

the equations of motions takes the form (p , x )/(, ) = 0.

the key step for the hj formulation is to consider a family of solutions to the equations
such that they ll a d-dimensional domain in spacetime. there are d 2 parameters, as,
to specify these solutions: x = x(, ; 1, , d2). they dene a mapping from the
parameter space (, , 1, , d2) onto the spacetime domain (x). in a region where
the mapping is one-to-one, p (, ; a) can be viewed as a local eld p (x). then the
equation of motion is tranformed to

p p = 0 .

(3)

making use of the reparametrization invariance, one can choose (, ) such that v2

 =
2, independent of  ,  and a. then m 2pdd = dxdx is the area element of the
world sheet with xed as. further the two form j(x)  1
2 pdx  dx = m 2d  d.
with the mapping between {, , a} and {x},  and  are regarded as local elds.
choosing s1 = m  (x) and s2 = m (x), p(x) is expressed as

p = s1s2  s1s2 .

it is important to recognize that the equation of motion for strings is contained in
2 p [p] 
4 (p p) = 0. hence it is reduced to the normailzation condition

the normalization condition. indeed with (4), eq. (3) becomes pp = 1
1
4 (pp ) =  1
pp = constant, or to

(s1)2(s2)2  (s1s2)2 = m 4 .

(5)

conversely, if the s1 and s2 satisfy the condition (5), then p given by (4) satises
the equation of motion. from p (x) a family of the nambu-goto string solutions are
reconstructed. eq. (5) is the hamilton-jacobi equation for bosonic strings, rst derived

by rinke.[1] the usage of a family of solutions makes the proof signicantly simple and

transparent compared with those of rinke[1] and of kastrup[6]. the equivalence holds in
any dimensions. eqs. (4) and (5) naturally generalize p = s and (s)2 = m2 for point
particles.

the above argument applies to the point particle case as well. the equation of motion

kastrup, nambu and rinke proposed a relation p = a  a a long time ago.[4]
we see a = s1s2 up to a gauge tranformation. the vector potential description is
redundant. it was shown by one of the authors that string motion can be expressed in
terms of (d  2) local scalar elds,[5] which is unnecessarily general and redundant.
is p = 0 where p = m x/ x2. a family of solutions are parametrized by d  1 as;
x = x( ; 1, , d1). with this mapping the equation is converted to pp = 0.
with the parametrization x2 = 1, pdx = md so that the covarinat momentum can be
expressed as p = s. the equation fo motion is reduced to pp = pp = 1
2 p2 =
0, i.e. (s)2 = m2. if one considers a family of trajectories starting at one point x
(0) at
 = 0, as are just momenta at x
(0). with this choice s(x) is the action evaluated at x.
in the case of strings the meaning of s1(x) and s2(x) is yet to be found.

the generalization to p-branes is straightforward. the action for p-branes in the

nambu-goto form is

i = m p+1z d dp" ()pv2

(p + 1)! #1/2

(6)

where v1p+1 = (x1 , , xp+1 )/(, 1, , p). the covariant momentum tensors
are given by p1p+1 = m p+1v1p+1 [()pv2/(p + 1)!]1/2. the equation of motion is
given by (p1p+1, x1 , , xp)/(, 1, , p) = 0. again by considering a family of
solutions the equation is converted to

p1p+11 p2p+1 = 0 .

with the parametrization v2 = (1)p(p + 1)!, p1p+1dx1    dxp+1  d  d1 
  dp. the covariant momentum tensor eld is represented in terms of (p + 1) local
scalar elds:

in this representation p1p+11 p2p+1 = (1)p(p1p+1p1p+1)/2(p+1) so that
the equation of motion becomes equivalent to the hamilton-jacobi equation given by

the equation for membranes (p = 2) has been discussed by aurilia et al.[11]

quantum equations which reduce to the hamilton-jacobi equation in the classical limit
h  0 can be easily found. there are several options. in the case of strings (p-branes)
one may start with a functional of lines (p-dimensional surfaces). this approach leads to

the string (p-brane) eld theory. in this letter we propose an alternative approach. we

look for quantum equations in the form of local eld equations, which turn out essentially

nonlinear with no free part. being local eld equations, they are expected to describe

only a part of dynamics of quantum strings. yet it is interesting and noteworthy that they

have connection to classical string dynamics through the hj equation.

the rst candidate is given by

l1 =

   m 4

,  =

(1, 2)
(x, x )

(10)

where as are complex scalar elds. the euler equations reduce to the hj equation (5) in
the h  0 limit with the ansatz a = aeisa/h. the lagrangian (10) contains no bilinear
terms. the hamiltonian density is positive semi-denite: h1 = h4(
jkjk) +
m 4
22. however, expressed in terms of conjugate momenta 
0kkb,
it appears singular when 1  2:

(11)

this is an essentially nonlinear system. although the canonical quantization can be carried

out, the full consistency is yet to be examined.

the second candidate is obtained by generalizing diracs approach. we prepare two

multi-component elds  and  and write

l2 = h2ab 

ab,cd dc  m 2aabb .

(12)

with the ansatz  = eis1/h and  = eis2/h, the euler equations reduce in the h  0
limit to


ab,cds1s2 + m 2acbd = 0 ,

(13)

or in short s1 s2 + m 2 = 0. this equation becomes identical to the hj equation
(5), provided

{ , }ab,cd = 2(gg  gg)acbd .

(14)

 s act on the two elds.

if  and  have n1 and n2 components, respectively,
then s are n1n2 dimensional matrices. to nd representations of the algebra (14),
rst consider the same algebra obeyed by n-dimensional matrices  : { , } =
2(gg  gg). since {} denes d(d  1)/2 dimensional cliord algebra in d
dimensions, n = 2[d(d1)/4] in the minimal representation. this algebra for  s has been
previously investigated in the context of string and p-brane eld equations in refs. [9] and

[10].

suppose that  is m-component scalar eld and a is in a spinor representation of

the  algebra. in other words we write


ab,cd = 

ac vbd ,

(15)

which satises (14) provided vabvbc = ac. the simplest choice is to consider a single
component eld  (m = 1), which leads to

l3 = h2     m 2   .

(16)

the lorentz transformation properties of  are claried by constructing the corre-
sponding generators. under a lorentz transformation x = 
ab b.
as is easily conrmed, s =  i
] satises the desired lorentz algebra. the dirac
conjugate is given by  =  where  =  = (i or 1)qd1
j=1 0j for d = 4n or 4n + 2,
respectively. further i[s,  ] = g +ggg and 1s
  = s.
these guarantee the invariance of the lagrangian (16) under proper lorentz transforma-

x, a =  i

4 [, 

2  s

tions. in d = 4, for instance,  has 8 components, which consists of two vectors as can be
seen from s .[9]

the discrete symmetry properties are subtle, however. under parity p , (x0, ~x ) 
(x0, ~x ) = (x0,~x ) and (x)  (x) = up (x). in order for the lagrangian (16) to be
invariant under p , we need (i) u 
p (0k, jk)up = (0k, jk). these
two are incompatible in even dimensions. the lagrangian (16) is not invariant under p .

p up =  and (ii) u 

5

another choice is to consider  and  in the same n-plet representation of the 
algebra. depending on the dimensionarity, however, one needs two copies of either  or

. in d = 4 (mod 4),  = q  (up to a phase) satises {, } = 0,  = , and 2 = 1.

we observe


ab,cd =

1

2(cid:0)

ac bd + ac
bd(cid:1) ,

(17)

or in short  = (  i +   )/2, satises the algebra (14). the corresponding

lagrangian is

l4 =

h2

2n        o  m 2   .

(18)

the lorentz generators are given by s = si +is . as [, s ] = 0, the lagrangian
l4 is lorentz invariant. the invariance of l4 under p is achieved if there exists up such
that (i) u 
p (0k, jk, )up = (0k, jk, ). the conditions
for 0k and  are incompatible. l4 in the minimal representation is not invariant under
p in d = 4 (mod 4). in d = 2 (mod 4) the dimension of  must be doubled to have .

p up = + or , and (ii) u 

with the doubling the lagrangian can be made p invariant in even dimensions. write

 = (  i +   )/2 in place of (17). the dirac conjugate of  is written as
 =  . under p ,   up . the appropriate choice is :  =   1,  = i  3,
up = i  2.  can be either   1 or   2.

in this paper we have given simple derivation of the hamilton-jacobi equations for

bosonic strings and p-branes, eqs. (5) and (9). we have then explored local eld equa-

tions which reduce to the hj equations in the classical limit. there are a variety of

possibilities. in all cases the equations are essentially nonlinear, which makes the quan-

tization formidable. we have not known whether the systems proposed are well dened

at the quantum level. the critical dimensionality inherent in string theories must arise
at the quantum level. the  algebra (14) is naturally associated with strings. yet its
implementation in eld theories in (16) and (18) requires more elaboration.

as remarked before, the local eld equations proposed above are expected to describe

at best a part of string dynamics. ultimate string eld equations should be formulated

in loop space with their projection yielding the local eld equations proposed here. the

extension of the current formalism to superstrings is yet to be achieved. we believe that

the hamilton-jacobi equations should serve as a helpful guide in searching such ultimate

superstring eld equations.
