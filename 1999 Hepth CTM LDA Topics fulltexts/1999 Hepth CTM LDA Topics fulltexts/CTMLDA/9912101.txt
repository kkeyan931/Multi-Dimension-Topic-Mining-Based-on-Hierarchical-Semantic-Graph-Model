(see also {$9912104$} background material symmetric product models.) applica- tions one describes second-quantized string theories considering single sigma model target snx, eectively second-quantizing spacetime rst. note want point orbifold conformal eld theories natural simple generalization. one include nontrivial discrete torsion class h 2(sn , u(1)) = z2 (1.2) action permutation group. torsion conguration space becomes mild sense non-commutative space. discrete torsion class denes spin cover permutation group disjoint elementary transpositions anticommute instead commute. point physically string theory becomes essentially supersymmetric, equal number bosonic fermionic strings, statistics determined winding number string (with even windings fermionic odd winding bosonic). plan note follows. rst recall denition inter- pretations discrete torsion orbifold conformal eld theories. apply formalism symmetric group section 3, explicitely compute eects two-cocycle (1.2). turn application cft second-quantized string theory sections 4 5. partition function, particular elliptic genus, described section 6. end concluding remarks speculations. 2. discrete torsion consider orbifold conformal eld theory obtained quotienting nite group g. well-known non-trivial two-cocycle c h 2(g, u(1)) (2.1) 2 group cohomology g dene new model weighting twisted sectors orbifold non-trivial phase, so-called discrete torsion . case sigma model geometric orbifold x/g discrete torsion seen particular choice b-eld gerbe modern parlance  (possibly singular) target space. one way understand discrete torsion realize orbifold quantum eld the- ories considered discrete gauge theories gauge group g. lagrangian formulation partition function orbifold theory riemann surface obtained summing possible g bundles . topologically bundles classied homotopy classes maps classifying space bg, base space universal g bundle. identify group cohomology h (g) usual cohomology classifying space bg. path-integral sum maps x: bg, (2.2) presence discrete torsion class c h 2(bg, u(1)) weight map x extra phase factor {$9701025$} hxc, u(1). (2.3) alternatively, hamiltonian formalism hilbert space h orbifold decom- poses sectors h =m hg (2.4) superselection sectors hg consist states twisted g g labeled conjugacy class . twisted states still carry residual action centralizer cg, subgroup consisting elements g commute twist g. normally, orbifold theory one projects twisted sector hg states invariant cg. but, presence discrete torsion projection picks states transform particular (possibly trivial) one-dimensional representation cg. representation cg, write (g, ), given terms group 2-cocycle c(g, h) (g, h) = c(g, h) c(h, g) , hg = gh. (2.5) one think representation (g, h) geometrically phase factor associ- ated (at) g bundle two-torus 2 given commuting pair holonomies (g, h). geometric interpretation, equivalently cocycle condition c, denition (g, h) manifest sl(2, z) invariant. one concrete way think particular one-dimensional representation cg follows. two-cocycle schur multiplier c h 2(g, u(1)) denes central extension bg g, 1 u(1) bg g 1. 3 (2.6) g nite group, z := h 2(g, u(1)) = h 3(g, z) (2.7) nite abelian group central extension restricted nite extension z, 1 z bg g 1. given central extension, pair commuting elements g, h group g, lift pair elements g, h covering group bg. central extension lifts longer necessarily commute, commutator elements g h gives required one-dimensional representation takes values z. is, (g, h) =  = g h g1h1 z. (2.9) note commutator independent choices lifts, since choices dier, denition, central element, central elements cancel commu- tator. 3. discrete torsion symmetric group let us consider case nite group g taken symmetric group n elements sn . case well-known stable range n 4 (2.8) (3.1) (3.2) h 2(sn , u(1)) = z2. is, unique non-trivial central extension permutation group 1 z2 bsn sn 1. (in case n < 4 extension z2 still exists, trivial considered extension u(1). example n = 2 get familiar extension z2 z4 z2.) geometrically think double cover follows. consider natural action sn orthonormal basis vector space rn . gives embedding sn o(n 1), orthogonal group acts hyperplane contains n basis vectors. orthogonal group unique z2 central extension p in(n 1). restricted rotation group so(n 1) usual spin cover spin(n 1). restriction spin cover symmetric group denes z2 central extension looking for. noted parastatistics, one considers higher-dimensional rep- resentations permutation group, central extension plays important role, 4 since leads spinor representation statistics group, see e.g. {$9701025$}. repre- sentations rst studied schur, play important role statistics quasiparticles pfaan = 1 2 quantum hall state. terms generators relations dene spin cover bsn follows . let us denote standard generators sn ti = 1, . . . , n 1. ti elementary transposition interchanges elements + 1. generators satisfy familiar relations t2 = 1, titi+1ti = ti+1titi+1, titj = tjti, j > + 1. (3.3) central extension obtained replacing generators lifts ti, adjoining central element z z2 = 1 (we often write z = 1) modifying relations t2 = z, titi+1ti = ti+1titi+1, titj = z tjti, j > + 1. (3.4) note lift transposition order four, two transpositions act disjunctly anticommute. spin extension operations, geometrically (weyl) reections, represented dirac matrices therefore anticommute instead commute. indeed last fact responsible non-trivial two-cocycle sn . comes z2 z2 subgroup generated interchanging particles 1 2 particles 3 4. generators satisfy t1 t3 = t3 t1. (3.5) discrete torsion symmetric group therefore simply lift group cocycle (so familiar string theorists) generates h 2(z2 z2, u(1)) = z2. (3.6) also explain discrete torsion appears n 4. using generators relations completely straightforward compute explicitly phases (g, h) twisted sectors. keep mind element g sn conjugate product cyclic permutations, labeled partition n  = (1)n1(2)n2 , xn1 5 nnn = n. (3.7) centralizer element g given cg =yn1 snn znn n since (g, h) representation cg, satises (g, h1h2) = (g, h1)(g, h2). (3.8) (3.9) therefore suces compute phases (g, h) two specic kinds elements h together generate cg: (1) generator cyclic group zn order n; (2) elementary transposition snn permutes two cycles length n. see analysis (and answer) depends critically overall signa- ture parity |g| = 0, 1 (mod 2) element g, note written |g| =xn1 (n 1)nn (mod 2). (3.10) example, since fundamental result |i j| > 1 (ti, tj) =  = 1, (3.11) often use fact that, two elements g h act disjunctly, either commute anticommute extension bsn , depending signs, (g, h) = (1)|g||h|. (3.12) case (1). let us rst consider sector twisted element g contains cycle length n. denote generator cycle k, kn = e. write g = k g g commutes k. since g k act disjunctly conclude (g, k) = (1)|g||k|, and, (g, k) = (g, k), therefore nd (g, k) =( 1, n odd, (1)|g|1, n even. 6 (3.13) (3.14) give interpretation result later. case (2). let us consider permutation xn interchanges two disjoint cycles equal length n 2 g. denote generators two cyclic group k k write k = k k. rst compute phase (xn, k). non-trivial computation actually case n = 2, since see general case follows directly this. case n = 2 choose k = t1 k = t3. exchange operator x2 satises denition written x2 t1 = t3 x2, x2 = t2t1t3t2. simple algebra one nds k = t1t3 k x2 = t1t3t2t1t3t2 = t3t1t2t1t3t2 = t3t2t1t2t3t2 = t3t2t1t3t2t2 = t3t2t3t1t2t2 = t2t3t2t1t2t2 = t2t3t1t2t1t2 = t2t1t3t2t1t2 = x2 k, (x2, k) = 1. (3.15) (3.16) (3.17) (3.18) since g written g = g k, g acts disjunctly x2, since x2 even parity, nd (x2, g) = (x2, k) = 1. (3.19) result formulated discrete torsion two cycles length 2 anti- commute instead commute. general case, consider exchange two cycles length n 2, simply observe element xn conjugacy class (2)n. element k acts cyclic permutation length n n two-cycles. is, k product n 1 elements exchange pair two-cycles therefore conjugated x2. therefore nd (xn, g) = (xn, k) = (1)n1. (3.20) straightforward interpretation. exchange two n-cycles obtain extra minus sign n even. n-cycles behave bosons n odd, fermions n even. 7 4. cft interpretation apply computations determine eect discrete torsion symmetric product orbifold conformal eld theory. 4.1. symmetric product orbifolds suppose start conformal eld theory x hilbert space h = h(x). want determine hilbert space symmetric orbifold snx = x n /sn . case without discrete torsion answer determined {$9701025$}. (see also {$9701025$} details chiral structure fusion rules, modular transformations braiding matrices rational permutation orbifold cfts.) answer elegantly formulated one considers direct sum sym- metric products snx summed n. resulting hilbert space structure fock space, generated innite set hilbert spaces hn, n 1, based target space x. precisely, use formal generating space symmetric powers dummy variable p sph =xn 0 xn 0 pn h(snx) =on>0 pn sn h, (4.1) (and similarlyvph generating space exterior powers), result spnhn(x), (4.2) hilbert spaces hn(x) dened subspace h(x) satisfying l0 l0 = 0 (mod n). (4.3) hilbert spaces hn carry redened hamiltonians l(n) states generally long strings {$9701025$} length n. 0 = l0/n. one refers note sector hg orbifold snx twisted group element g conjugacy class corresponds summand expression. (n)nn  =yn1 on1 snnhn 8 (4.4) (4.5) formulas remembered starting point action symmetric group sn h. freedom want sn act. general, space h graded corresponding action sn respect gradation. is, act appropriate way symmetrization anti- symmetrization even odd parts. example h hilbert space free fermion, z2 graded fermion number. actions permutation group always assumed graded sense. 4.2. symmetric products torsion let us see formulas changed one includes discrete torsion. first distinguish twisted sectors related n-cycles n odd even. according formula (3.20) statistics sectors commuting anticommuting depending whether n odd even. refer states bosons fermions. fermion number f (mod 2) twisted state simply equals sign corresponding cyclic permutation. total parity |g| twisted sector g thus reects total fermion number state. note combinatorial fermion number added fermion number might already present gradation one-string hilbert space h(x). secondly, sector corresponding n-cycle also implement zn projection. seen, case without discrete torsion invariance action zn subgroup changes conventional level matching condition. instead requirement spin l0 l0 integer, one restricts modied condition hilbert space hn spin n-fold (4.3). discrete torsion turned on, formula (3.14) tells us project dif- ferently case n even (1)|g| = 1. case longer require invariance zn instead keep states sign representation generator zn represented 1. new level matching condition gives following quantization spin strings even length n: := l(n) 0 l (n) 0 = 1 n (l0 l0) z + 1 2 . (4.6) is, orbifold cft fermionic states even length n half-integer spin. since l0 l0 always integer, condition clearly makes sense n even. note overall spin state still integer, apply construction case total fermion number even. denote quite generally h n subspaces hn (half)integer spin, i.e., subspaces consisting states satisfy (1)2m = 1. adding everything together hilbert space symmetric product orbifold snx 9 nontrivial 2-cocycle c h 2(sn , u(1)) takes following form sp2n1h+ 2n1 vp2nh 2n hc(snx) = meven {nn} p nnn=n on>0 modd {nn} p nnn=n on>0 sp2n1h+ 2n1 vp2nh+ 2n (4.7) partition {nn} called even odd depending parity |g| correspond- ing permutation. 5. second-quantized strings let us make remarks physical interpretation result string theory. course obvious eect discrete torsion changed statistics strings. long strings even length turned fermions, strings odd length still bosons. since roughly many bosons fermions model looks supersymmetric, although, point out, perhaps better refer ghosts instead fermions. second, subtle eect discrete torsion inuence quantization spins fermionic strings. interpretation made precise terms light-cone quantization formalism. 5.1. interpretation dlcq recall permutation orbifold cfts conguration space snx appear natu- rally description second-quantized strings theories x r1,1 (5.1) light-cone gauge, longtudinal momentum p+ discretized, so-called discrete light-come quantization dlcq. quantization scheme null coordinate x+ used describe time evolution system, whereas null coordinate x, canonically conjugated p+, assumed periodic. interpretation symmetric product orbifold used matrix string interpretation ten- dimensional type iia string six-dimensional little string theories related coinciding vebranes. (see also {$9701025$} review little string theories.) interpretation quantum number n, length string, proportional discrete momentum p+. fact, purposes best identify p+ = n 2 10 (5.2) want think states p+ integer half-integer elds periodic anti-periodic around compact direction x. well-known setup best-known example dlcq eld theory: chiral conformal eld theory 1 + 1 dimensions. momentum p+ simply eigenvalue operator l0 (not confused world-sheet l0 used above) know fermionic eld eigenvalue half-integer ns spin structure integer r spin structure. however, something strange going here. according computation states p+ integer turned fermions, whereas bosons half- integer p+ respectively. since bosons sensitive spin structure get naturally anti-periodic boundary conditions, see point view actually dealing elds appropriately called ghosts, since usual relation spin statistics satised. clash spin-statistics theorem two bosons decay fermion etc. understand second eect discrete torsion remember strings dlcq carry two natural quantum numbers: longitudinal momentum p+ = n/2 discussed together longitudinal winding number w, integer measures number times string wrapped around compactied x direction. light- cone gauge coordinate x expressed terms world-sheet stress-tensor x = 1 p+ (z). therefore winding number given w = 1 2i dx = 1 p+ (l0 l0) = 2m, (5.3) (5.4) conformal eld theory spin. seen half-integer, w even odd. combination p+w = l0 l0 = nm (5.5) always integer, required level-matching. presence discrete torsion fermionic strings, n even, dierent excitations depending whether total fermion number even odd. total fermion number even, fermionic strings half-integer spin excitations, equivalently odd winding numbers. total fermion number odd, winding numbers even, always case bosonic strings. interpretation still satisfying intuitive, turn dual picture obtained performing t-duality. 11 5.2. t-duality stringy spin structures interesting point concerning t-duality null direction x. duality interchange momentum p+ winding number w, equivalently quantum numbers n m. case without torsion manifest symmetry second-quantized theory. (in order make full symmetry one add p+ = 0 sector, always problematic light-cone quantization. see also discussion {$9701025$}.) symmetry momentum winding modes seems broken presence discrete torsion, since momentum p+ determines statistics strings. fact, complete physical interpretation becomes conventional work t-dual framework. interchange (to precise) p+ w/2, w = n, p+ = m, (5.6) strings wrapped even number times fermions, wrapped odd number times bosons. would obvious assume unwrapped strings n = 0 also fermionic, although appear explicitly dlcq scheme. since fermionic elds, one think making spin projection model, summing spin structures along x direction projecting even fermion number procedure implemented summing spin structures time direction x+. would spacetime equivalent familiar procedure two dimensional cft, sum spin structures produces fermionic non-local model bosonic local model. however, introducing spacetime spin structures string theory introduces extra complication, fermions also carry winding numbers. indeed, consider general situation string spacetime contains s1, say convenience radius one. circle momenta p z winding numbers w z. level-matching cft always require p w z. (5.7) consider (spacetime) fermion mode string. pick spin structure circle determines boundary conditions eld. two choices: anti-periodic (neveu-schwarz) spin structure gives p z + 1 2 periodic (ramond) spin structure quantizes momentum p z. however, string also carries winding number w story gets bit complicated. half-integer p cannot allow arbitrary integer winding number, since level-matching requires p w integer. see string states even winding number fermions. eect observing note: fermion statistics consistent strings even length. naturally anti-periodic. see also closely related discussion {$9701025$}. 12 seen even windings couple spin structure, naturally sum spin structures, compactied space direction (which might null, dlcq) time direction. latter procedure familiar interpretation projection even fermion number. ns sector, p half-integer quantized unique ground state, implies total parity |g| even. eect seen. |g| even could half-integer m. r sector spin projection ambiguous, assignment fermion number ground state. according formulas assign ground state odd fermion number, since require total parity |g| odd case. 6. elliptic genus interesting translate considerations concrete formula genus one partition function orbifold theory including eect discrete torsion. formula becomes particularly simple restrict chiral partition function, so-called elliptic genus calabi-yau sigma models (at least) n = 2 supersymmetry dened following character rr sector (x; q, y) = tr hrr(cid:2)(1)f yflql0 c 24(cid:3) given fourier expansion (x; q, y) =xm, c(m, )qmy (6.1) (6.2) chiral partition function sigma model x, generating function elliptic genera symmetric products z(p, q, y) =xn 0 pn (snx; q, y) = yn>0, m, (1 pnqmy)c(nm,) (6.3) sketched previous section, partition function (and therefore also elliptic genus) orbifold discrete torsion best written sum spacetime spin structures z(p, q, y) = 1 2 (z++ + z+ + z+ + z) .
