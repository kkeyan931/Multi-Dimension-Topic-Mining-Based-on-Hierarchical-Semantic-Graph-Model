abstract

using a sequence of bogoliubov transformations, we obtain an exact
expression for the vacuum state of a dirac eld in 2 + 1 dimensions
in presence of a constant magnetic eld. this expression reveals a
peculiar two level pairing structure for any value of the mass m  0.
this calculation claries the nature of the condensate in the lowest
landau level whose existence has been emphasized recently by several
authors.

1 introduction

the phenomenon of symmetry breaking induced by an external homogeneous
magnetic eld of an internal u(2) symmetry for the dirac eld in 2 + 1 di-
mensions has recently attracted some attention. the reason why people are
interested in this phenomenon is its possible relevance in the more complex
context of interacting elds, especially in situations where spontaneous sym-
metry breaking is expected, like in strong coupling qed and njl models
[7, 9, 10, 6].the symmetry breaking is connected with a property of the the-
ory called spectral asymmetry of the lowest landau level (lll) and it is
revealed by the calculation of the order parameter

where m is the mass of the dirac eld. this parameter is sometimes called
avor condensate.

the expression (1) can be obtained using the proper time method of
schwinger [11] or through the development the propagator in terms of landau
poles [5, 7]. from the calculations one sees that the result (1) depends on
the dominance of the lll, when m  0.
the methods used to obtain (1) do not reveal completely the structure of
the condensate since they do not need the explicit expression of the vacuum
state.
in this paper we obtain the explicit expression of the vacuum in
presence of a magnetic eld in terms of the creation and destruction operator
of the free eld (b = 0). the problem is not entirely trivial and is solved
by performing in sequence two bogoliubov transformations. the rst leads

|bi of the dirac eld in presence of magnetic eld. these operators when

the landau levels; they can be interpreted as degenerate eigenstates of an

and antiparticles with opposite momenta. this step does not involve the
magnetic eld. the second transformation acts on auxiliary creation and

from the vacuum of the free eld |0i to a bcs type statec|0i, pairing particles
destruction operators associated with c|0i. their pairing leads to the vacuum
applied to c|0i create or destroy states having the same quantum numbers of
auxiliary hamiltonian bh with energy equal to the lll. the structure of the

vacuum just described is the same for any value of m including m  0 and
disappears in the non relativistic limit that is for m  .
we believe that this calculation has a twofold interest. the problem of
the dirac eld in 2 + 1 dimensions in presence of a constant magnetic eld is
solved by operator techniques which make clear its non perturbative nature.
in view of the study of non trivial models with interaction it provides an
application of the principle solve the ground state rst, then it is easier to
understand the excitations [12].

2 the dirac equation in 2 + 1 dimensions

the main properties of the 2+1 dimensional dirac eld theory in an external
homogeneous magnetic eld have been discussed in [3, 4, 2, 7] and will be
now summarized to make the paper self-contained.

consider the lagrangian l:

l = b(x) [id  m] b(x)
d =   iea

(2)

where e is the modulus of the electron charge. since the external magnetic

2

eld is constant and homogeneous we can choose the landau gauge:

a = 1bx2 .

(3)

in 2 + 1 dimensions there are two inequivalent minimal versions of the

dirac algebra [2]:

{, } = 2g

0 = 0

i = i

 = 0, 1, 2
i = 1, 2 .

in the following we shall use the representations:

and

e0 = 3
b0 = 3

e1 = i1
b1 = i1

e2 = i2
b2 = i2

where i are the pauli matrices. the complex spinors associated with the
two minimal versions will be respectively indicated with 1(x) e 2(x).

a chiral version is obtained as the direct sum of the two inequivalent

irreducible representations (5) and (6):

(4)

(5)

(6)

(7)

(8)

(9)

with this notation the lagrangian in the chiral version is connected to

the lagrangians in the two minimal versions by the following relationship:

 =(cid:18)e

0

0 b(cid:19) =(cid:18)e

l = l1 + l2

i =(1

i = 1
i = 2

0 e(cid:19)
i (x) [ied  im] b

i (x)

li = b

b
i (x) = b
i



(x)3

i = 1, 2 .

the two lagrangians l1 and l2 dier only for the sign of the mass term.
in the minimal versions both lagrangians l1 and l2 are invariant under
charge conjugation c, while the mass term changes sign under parity p and
in the minimal versions there is no generator of chiral
time reversal t .
symmetry, that is there is no symmetry (except p and t ), that distinguishes
the theory with mass from the theory with zero mass.
in the chiral version the three discrete symmetries c, p and t are pre-
served and therefore the mass term breaks neither parity nor time reversal.

3

besides, we can introduce the following matrices, which anticommute with
each other and with the other matrices  dened in (7):

i 0(cid:19)
3 = i(cid:18)0 i

5 = i0123 = i(cid:18) 0

i 0(cid:19) .

i

(10)

in the chiral version we can introduce an internal u(2) group of symmetry,

dened by the generators t:

u()  u(2) : u() = eit

 = 0, ..., 3

t0 = i

t1 = 5

t2 =

1
i

3

t3 = 35 .

(11)

(12)

the mass term m  of the lagrangian breaks this symmetry group into the
in the limit where the
subgroup u(1)  u(1) with generators t0 and t3.
mass m tends to zero, the u(2) symmetry is not recovered and one obtains
a continuum of degenerate vacua. the result (1) can be interpreted as an
eect of spin polarization (or spin orientation) due to the magnetic eld. a

generalization of formula (1) in which the magnetic uxr d2xb(x) replaces

b is valid in the inhomogeneous case [10, 6].

the problem of a free dirac eld, minimally coupled to a homogeneous
magnetic eld, can be exactly solved and in the landau gauge the expression
of the dirac eld in the chiral version is (eb > 0):

1 (x)

b

2 (x)(cid:19)

b(x) =(cid:18)b
xn=0xp1 {unp1(x)anp1 + vnp1(x)b

(20)

the operators anp1, ..., dnp1 satisfy the usual canonical anticommutation re-
lations and hn() are the hermite polynomials. the case eb < 0 can be
obtained by applying the charge conjugation operator.

one of the main properties of the theory in the minimal versions is the
spectrum asymmetry concerning the lowest landau level (lll). this prop-
erty holds also for an inhomogeneous magnetic eld [1, 8, 13]. for example, if
m > 0 (that is in the representation (5)), and if eb > 0, the energy spectrum
is described by:

e = pm2 + (2n + 1  )eb

( = +1

 = 1

if e > 0
if e < 0

where (1/2) are the eigenvalues of the spin operator s3 = (1/2)3. from
(16) u0p1 6= 0 and v0p1  0. the situation is inverted in the representation
(6) (m < 0).

3 vacuum state

the lagrangian, describing the dirac eld in presence of an external mag-
netic eld, is bilinear in the fermionic eld b(x), and we may expect that
the vacuum state of the theory can be calculated by an approach  `a la bo-
goliubov, that is by relating the fermionic eld in the presence of a magnetic
eld to the free eld by means of a linear transformation. the calculation,
which we will now illustrate, will refer to the minimal version representation
(5), as the generalization to the chiral version is immediate.

the dirac equations describing in 2 + 1 dimensions the free eld and the
eld in presence of the external eld are rst order dierential equations, and
it is possible to impose the same initial condition:

1(0, x) = b

1 (0, x) .

(21)

5

for the free eld we have the plane waves decomposition:

1(x) =xp r m
2m 
u(p) =r ep + m

p(cid:9)
l1l2ep(cid:8)u(p)eipxap + v(p)eipxb
 v(p) =rep + m
2m 

p2  ip1
ep + m

1

1

p2 + ip1
ep + m

(22)

 (23)

where ep = (m2 + |p|2)1/2.
the initial condition (21) enables us to nd the canonical transforma-
tion between the operators (anp1, bnp1) and the corresponding creation and
destruction operators in absence of the magnetic eld (ap, bp). the free eld
1(x) and the one in presence of a magnetic eld b
1 (x) are not developed
in the same bases of wave functions, and to obtain the desired canonical
transformation the following relations are useful:

eip2x2

wn(p1

x2) =

xn=0
= eil2p1p22
2(i)nl
l2 xp2

(i)nwn(p1

x2)wn(lp2)

wn(lp2)eip2x2

eil2p1p2

.

(24)

(25)

the expression (24) follows by analytic continuation for t  i of the

relation [14]:


tnwn(x)wn(y) =

x2

2  (xyt)2
y2

1t2

1

1  t2

e

|t| < 1

(26)

whereas (25) represents the fourier transformation of a hermite function.

using (24) and identifying the coecients associated to any function

wn(), we obtain the transformation

xn=0

anp1 =xp2

np = bnwn(lp2) + ancpwn1(lp2)

these transformations preserve the canonical anticommutation relations.

we look for a normalized state |bi such that:

anp1|bi = 0 = bnp1|bi

n, p1

introducing the auxiliary creation and destruction operators

the last step consists in nding the relation between the vacuum c|0i and

the vacuum |0i in absence of magnetic eld. we nd easily using (31)

banp1c|0i = 0 =bbnp1c|0i
n, p1
we deduce immediately the relation between |bi and c|0i:
np1(cid:17)c|0i .
|bi =yn1yp1 (cid:16)an + bnba
np1bb
c|0i =yp s ep + m

2ep (cid:16)1 + cpa
np1(cid:17)yh r eh + m
|bi = yn1 p1(cid:16)an + bnba

the nal result is:

p(cid:17)|0i .

with an and bn given in (18).
auxiliary operators

if c|0i is the vacuum associated with the

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

(35)

(36)

the independence of c|0i on the magnetic eld is a consequence of the fact

that in (31) b appears only in the multiplicative factors of the bogoliubov
transformations within curly brackets. it is clear that the structure of the
vacuum does not change when m  0.
in order to clarify the meaning of the auxiliary operators let us write the
hamiltonian in presence of magnetic eld in terms of these operators. using
(31) we nd

hb = bh 
bh  m

xn=1xp1
xn=0xp1 (cid:16)ba

np1 +bbnp1banp1(cid:17)
2neb(cid:16)ba
np1bb
np1bbnp1(cid:17) .
np1banp1 +bb

the expression of the hamiltonian bh shows that banp1 andbbnp1 describe

particles with degenerate energy m, that is the energy of the lll. the mag-
netic eld induces creation and destruction of particle-antiparticle pairs of
the auxiliary eld and this removes the degeneracy giving the usual landau
levels.
