using the u-plane integral of moore and witten, we derive a simple expression for the
donaldson invariants of product ruled surfaces g  s2, where g is a riemann surface
of genus g. this expression generalizes a theorem of morgan and szabo for g = 1 to any

genus g. we give two applications of our results: (1) we derive thaddeus formulae for

the intersection pairings on the moduli space of rank two stable bundles over a riemann
surface. (2) we derive the eigenvalue spectrum of the fukaya-floer cohomology of gs1.

1. introduction

the donaldson invariants of smooth four-manifolds have played a very important role

in physics and mathematics in the last years. since the reformulation of donaldson theory
by witten in terms of twisted n = 2 yang-mills theory [1], the physical approach to
donaldson theory has opened unsuspected perspectives. the main breakthrough, in this

respect, was the introduction of seiberg-witten invariants in [2] and wittens magic

formula relating the donaldson and seiberg-witten invariants of simply-connected four-
manifolds with b+

2 > 1 and of simple type. this relation was fully explained in the
fundamental paper of moore and witten [3], which also analyzed donaldson-witten theory
for manifolds of b+

2 = 1 using the formalism of the u-plane integral.

the u-plane integral of moore and witten has been studied during the last two years

from many dierent points of view [4][5][6][7][8][9][10]. one of the most interesting out-

comes of this approach has been a complete understanding of donaldson invariants of

non-simply connected manifolds. the study of this problem from the point of view of the

u-plane integral was initiated in [3][4] and completed in [6], where (among other things) a

general wall-crossing formula for non-simply connected manifolds was derived, generalizing

the results obtained in [11] using algebro-geometric methods.

1.1. product ruled surfaces

among non-simply connected manifolds of b+

2 = 1, product ruled surfaces play an
important role in donaldson theory. these are four-manifolds of the form g  s2, where
g is a riemann surface of genus g. in [6], a direct application of the lattice reduction

technique of [3] led to explicit expressions for the donaldson invariants of these surfaces, in
the chamber where the volume of s2 is small. using these expressions and summing up the

innite number of wall-crossing terms, one can derive in principle the donaldson-witten

generating function of product ruled surfaces in the chamber where the volume of g is

small. this was the approach followed in [6], where explicit and compact formulae were

written down using kroneckers double identity to sum up the wall-crossing terms.

however, formulae for the donaldson invariants based on wall-crossing tend to be in-

eective when the instanton number is large. based on physical intuition, we would expect

that some of the properties of the donaldson-witten series will not be apparent in these

kinds of expressions, which are based on calculations made in the electric frame. the

approach based on wall-crossing formulae makes it dicult to write generating formulae,

1

even for lower genus, and in fact one of the motivations of this paper was to reproduce the

simple result of morgan and szabo for g = 1 [12] using the u-plane integral.

the approach that we follow in this paper is to perform a direct calculation of the
u-plane integral in the chamber where g is very small. this requires a slight general-
ization of the computation in [3] to allow for a non-zero stiefel-whitney class.
in this

chamber, there is a very important contribution coming from the seiberg-witten invari-

ants. in this case, this contribution can be also computed from the u-plane integral via

wall-crossing, with the important dierence that the number of walls is always nite. this

is the main reason for the relative simplicity of our nal expression, which is expressed in

terms of magnetic variables. therefore, together with the results given in [6], one nds

two dierent expressions for the donaldson invariants of product ruled surfaces. this is
somewhat similar to the case of cp 2, whose invariants were computed in [13] by summing
up an innite number of wall-crossings, and in [3] by direct evaluation of the u-plane in-
tegral. there is, however, one important dierence: in the case of cp 2 both expressions
are expressed in terms of electric variables, while in this case one of them is written in

electric variables, and the other in magnetic variables. depending on the problem we

are interested on, we will nd useful one expression or the other.

1.2. relation to the moduli space of stable bundles on a curve

apart from its intrinsic interest, the importance of having explicit expressions for

the donaldson invariants of product ruled surfaces comes from their relation to other

interesting moduli problems. first of all, for zero instanton number, the moduli space of
instantons on g  s2 is nothing but the moduli space of at connections on the riemann
surface g. this space has been extensively studied by mathematicians, and the structure
of its cohomology ring has been explored using gauge-theoretic techniques, starting with

the seminal paper of atiyah and bott [14]. using the connection to verlinde formula

[15], thaddeus [16] was able to compute the intersection pairings for the generators of

the cohomology ring. the moduli space of at connections can be also described by

a two-dimensional version of donaldson-witten theory. in [17], witten gave a physical

derivation of these intersection pairings by exploiting the relation of this two-dimensional

topological eld theory to physical 2d yang-mills theory [18]. he found in fact explicit

formulae for higher rank gauge groups. in this paper, we will give another derivation of

thaddeus formulae using the donaldson invariants of product ruled surfaces. in a sense,

our derivation can be regarded as the dimensional reduction of donaldson-witten theory

down to two dimensions. in this case, as we are considering zero instanton number, it is

preferable to use the electric expressions given in [6].

2

1.3. relation to fukaya-floer cohomology

another important application of the donaldson invariants of product ruled surfaces
is to the (fukaya)-floer cohomology of g  s1. the fukaya-floer cohomology of g  s1
gives the gluing theory for donaldson invariants along this three-manifold, and the gluing

theory can be used in turn to derive important properties of donaldson invariants of general
four-manifolds [19][20][21]. the ring structure of the floer cohomology of gs1 has been
studied from many dierent points of view. in [22], an explicit presentation was obtained

under the assumption that the eigenvalues can be obtained from the donaldson invariants
of g  1. this presentation was nally derived by v. munoz in [23], and a partial
determination of the ring structure of the fukaya-floer cohomology was obtained in [19]. in
a sense, the information contained in the fukaya-floer cohomology of g s1 is equivalent
to the information contained in the donaldson invariants of product ruled surfaces. using

our magnetic expression for the donaldson invariants, it is straightforward to nd the

eigenvalue spectrum of the fukaya-floer cohomology. it is interesting to notice that this

spectrum is by no means obvious from the electric expressions, in other words, it can

not be seen in a semiclassical instanton expansion.

1.4. relation to the quantum cohomology of the moduli space of stable bundles over curves

we have seen that the donaldson invariants of product ruled surfaces that correspond

to zero pontriagin number give the intersection pairings on the moduli space of stable

bundles over a riemann surface. it has been argued that the donaldson invariants with

non-zero pontriagin numbers, when computed in the chamber where g is small and with
stiefel-whitney classes satisfying (w2(e), [g]) 6= 0, give essentially the gromov-witten
invariants of this moduli space. this was shown in [22] using the dimensional reduction of
topological yang-mills theory on gs2 to a type a topological sigma model whose target
space was the moduli space of at connections on the riemann surface 1. the relation

between the gromov-witten invariants and the donaldson invariants is equivalent to the
atiyah-floer conjecture, which says that the floer cohomology of g  s1 is isomorphic
as a ring to the quantum cohomology of the moduli space of stable bundles over g. the

1 in [4] it was argued, by performing the dimensional reduction in the low-energy action,
that the eective two-dimensional theory can be formulated in terms of a topological landau-

ginzburg model, which would then give an equivalent description of the quantum cohomology in

a way reminiscent of mirror symmetry. it would be interesting to check this in some detail.

3

isomorphism of vector spaces was proved in [24], and the ring isomorphism was proved

in [25]. using this isomorphism, one can interpret our formula (5.15) for the generating

function of the donaldson invariants as a generating function for the gromov-witten

invariants.

1.5. organization of the paper

the organization of this paper is as follows:

in section 2, we give a brief summary

of the results of [6] for the donaldson invariants of non-simply connected manifolds. in

section 3, we compute the donaldson invariants of product ruled surfaces in the chambers
of small volume for g and for s2 by direct evaluation. in section 4, we derive thaddeus
formulae for the intersection pairing and verlindes formulae. in section 5, we explain the

connection to fukaya-floer cohomology and derive the eigenvalue spectrum.

2. donaldson-witten theory on non-simply connected manifolds

the donaldson invariants of smooth, compact, oriented four-manifolds x [26] are

dened by using intersection theory on the moduli space of anti-self-dual connections. the

cohomology classes on this space are associated to homology classes of x through the slant

product [26] or, in the context of topological eld theory, by using the descent procedure

[1]. in this paper, we will restrict ourselves to the donaldson invariants associated to zero,

one and two-homology classes. the inclusion of three-classes has been considered in [6].

dene

a(x) = sym(h0(x)  h2(x))  h1(x).

then, the donaldson invariants can be regarded as functionals

dw2(e)

x

: a(x)  q,

(2.1)

(2.2)

where w2(e)  h 2(x, z) is the second stiefel-whitney class of the gauge bundle. it is
convenient to organize these invariants as follows. let {i}i=1,...,b1 be a basis of one-cycles,
{i}i=1,...,b1 the corresponding dual basis of harmonic one-forms, and {si}i=1,...,b2 a basis
of two-cycles. we introduce the formal sums

 =

b1xi=1

i i,

s =

vi si,

b2xj=1

4

(2.3)

where vi are complex numbers, and i are grassmann variables. the generator of the 0-
class will be denoted by x  h0(x, zz). we then dene the donaldson-witten generating
function:

zdw (p, i, vi) = dw2(e)

x

(epx++s)

(2.4)

so that the donaldson invariants can be read o from the expansion of the left-hand side

in powers of p, i and vi. the main result in [1] is that zdw can be understood as the
generating functional of a twisted version of the n = 2 supersymmetric gauge theory 
with gauge group su (2)  in four dimensions  see [1][3][27] for details. in the twisted

theory one can dene observables o(x), i1() = r o1, i2(s) = rs o2 (where oi are

functionals of the elds of the theory) in one to one correspondence with the homology

classes of x, and in such a way that the generating functional

hepo+i1()+i2(s)i,

is precisely zdw (p, i, vi).

based on the low-energy eective descriptions of n = 2 gauge theories obtained in
[28][29], witten obtained a explicit formula for (2.4) in terms of seiberg-witten invariants
for manifolds of b+

2 > 1 and simple type [2]. the general framework to give a complete
evaluation of (2.4) was established in [3]. the main result of moore and witten is an

explicit expression for the generating function zdw :

zdw = zu + zsw

(2.5)

which consists of two pieces. zsw is the contribution from the moduli space msw of
solutions of the seiberg-witten monopole equations. zu (the u-plane integral henceforth)
is the integral of a certain modular form over the fundamental domain of the group 0(4),
that is, over the quotient 0(4) \ h, where h is the upper half-plane. the explicit form of
zu was derived in [3] for simply connected four-manifolds, and extended to the non-simply
connected case in [6]. zu is non-vanishing only for manifolds with b+

2 = 1, and provides
a simple physical explanation of the failure of topological invariance of the donaldson

invariants on those manifolds [3].

5

2.1. the u-plane integral

we will start by considering the u-plane piece. we will assume for simplicity that b1

is even, although the general story is very similar. we can assume that x has b+

2 = 1
(otherwise the u-plane integral is zero). in this case, there is a normalized self-dual two
form or period point , with 2 = 1, which generates h 2,+(x, ir)  ir. the self-dual and
anti-self-dual projections of a two-form  are then given by + = (, ),  =   +.
another important aspect of non-simply connected four-manifolds of b+
2 = 1 is that the

image of the map

 : h 1(x, zz)  h 1(x, zz)  h 2(x, zz)

(2.6)

is generated by a single rational cohomology class  [11], so that for any two elements of
the basis {i}i=1,...,b1 of h 1(x, zz), i  j = aij, where aij is an antisymmetric b1  b1
matrix 2.

as shown in [3][6], the new ingredient in the u-plane integral for non-simply connected
manifolds is an integration over the jacobian torus of x, tb1 = h 1(x, ir)/h 1(x, zz).
there is a basis of one-forms on tb1 that we will denote by 
i  h 1(tb1 , zz), and which
are dual to i  h 1(x, zz). notice that there is an isomorphism h1(x, zz)  h 1(tb1, zz),
given by i  
i as the image of  in (2.3) under this
isomorphism. finally, we introduce a symplectic two-form on tb1 as

i=1 i

i . we will then dene  =pb1
 =xi<j

aij

i  
j,

(2.7)

(2.8)

(2.9)

which does not depend on the choice of basis. this is a volume element for the torus,

hence

vol(tb1) =ztb1

b1/2
(b1/2)!

.

we can now write the u-plane integral in the non-simply connected case:

zu =depo(p )+w1()+i(s)ew2(e)

(2.10)

where x = re( ), y = im( ). in this expression, the function bf(p, , s, , y) is an almost

holomorphic modular form, as well as a dierential form on tb1, given by:

we have denoted the intersection form in two-cohomology by ( , ) and used poincare duality
to convert cohomology classes in homology classes. ( s) is a siegel-narain theta function

given by:

(2.11)

(2.12)

so (2.11) is also a dierential form on tb1, and 20 is a integer lifting of w2(e) 3. finally,
in the above expressions u, t, h, f1 and f2 are modular forms dened as follows:

in this formulae, q = e2i , and i, i = 2, 3, 4 are the jacobi theta functions (we follow the

notation in [3]). notice that t does not transform well under modular transformations,

3 we have absorbed all the b1 dependent factors in the u-plane integral of [6] in the normal-

ization of the dierential forms on tb1 , in order to get more compact expressions.

7

due to the presence of the second eisenstein series. in (2.10), we have used the related

form

8y

(2.14)

bt = t +

which is not holomorphic but transforms well under modular transformations. we also

dene the related holomorphic function f(p, , s,  ) as in (2.10) but with t instead of

one immediate application of the u-plane integral formalism is the derivation of the

bt.
wall-crossing behavior of donaldson invariants. as explained in [3], the integral (2.9)
has a discontinuous variation at the cusps of 0(4)\h whenever the cohomology class
  h 2(x; zz) is such the period    changes sign. we then say that  denes a wall.
the cusps are located at  = i,  = 0, and  = 2. the wall-crossing behavior associated
to the cusp at innity gives the wall-crossing properties of the donaldson invariants, while

the discontinuous variation of the integral at  = 0, 2 must cancel against the contribution

to wall-crossing from the seiberg-witten piece zsw . as shown in [3], this cancellation

completely xes the structure of zsw .

the wall-crossing of the u-plane integral at  = i can be easily derived by imitating
the analysis in section 4 of [3]. the conditions for wall-crossing are 2 < 0 and + = 0,
and one nds [6]:

w c() =

(2.15)

.

using the q-expansion of the dierent modular forms, it is easy to check that the wall-
crossing term is dierent from zero only if 0 > 2  p1/4, where p1 is the pontriagin
number of the gauge bundle (and p1  w2(e)2 mod 4). the expression (2.15) generalizes
the wall-crossing formula of [13] to non-simply connected manifolds. wall-crossing terms

for non-simply connected manifolds were computed in [11] using algebro-geometric methods
in some particular cases 4.

4 in comparing to the expressions in [13][11], one has to take into account that what they call

 or  is in fact our 2.

8

2.2. the seiberg-witten contribution

the structure of the seiberg-witten contribution zsw on non-simply connected four-
manifolds has been studied in detail in [6], following the approach in [3]. we will not

repeat the analysis here but we will write down several formulas which will be useful later.

the sw part zsw contains two pieces which correspond to the cusps at  = 0, 2,
and is written in terms of universal modular forms and of the seiberg-witten invariants

introduced in [2]. a crucial ingredient in the discussion of the seiberg-witten contribution

for non-simply connected manifolds is that we have to consider generalized seiberg-witten

invariants, which involve integration of dierential forms on the moduli space of solutions

to the monopole equations. these dierential forms can be constructed, in the context of

topological eld theory, using the descent procedure, and they are associated to one-cycles

in the four-manifold x. equivalently, to every element i in the basis of one-forms of x
introduced above, with i = 1, . . . , b1, we associate a one-form i on m. the generalized
seiberg-witten invariants are then introduced as follows. let   h 2(x, zz) + w2(x)/2 be
a spinc structure on x 5, and let m be the corresponding seiberg-witten moduli space,
with virtual dimension d = 2  (2 + 3)/4. we then dene:
1      r  a

sw (, 1      r) =zm

(2.16)

dr

d

,

2

where ad is a two-form which represents the rst chern class of the universal line bundle
on the moduli space. these generalized invariants (and their wall-crossing properties) have

been considered in [30].

we can now write a general expression for zsw in the case of a four-manifold of

b+
2 = 1. to do this, we rst introduce the following modular forms:

um (qd) =

hm (qd) =

f1m (qd) =

5 in the mathematical literature, spinc structures are rather given by integral cohomology

classes which reduce to w2(x) mod 2. they correspond to 2 in our notation.

9

these modular forms are (up to the modular weight) the same modular forms as in (2.13)
but evaluated at d = 1/ , that is,  hm ( ) = h(1/ ), and so on.

expansions, we have used the dual variable qd = e2id . we will denote by  =pb1

in the above
i=1 ii
the formal combination of one-forms which is dual to  in (2.3). zsw can then be written
as the sum of two terms. the rst one (corresponding to the cusp at  = 0, or monopole

cusp) is given by the following expression:

where the rst sum is over all the spinc-structures on x. as shown in [2], only a nite
number of  give non-zero seiberg-witten invariants (for a given metric). the second piece
in zsw corresponds to the cusp at  = 2 (the dyon contribution) and it has exactly the
same form, with the only dierence that one has to use the modular forms

udy = um ,

hdy = ihm ,

f1dy = f1m ,

f2dy = if2m ,

tdy = tm (2.19)

(2.20)

in agreement with the arguments based on r-symmetry [2][3][27]. the structure of zsw is
such that the wall-crossing behavior due to the seiberg-witten invariants exactly cancels

the wall-crossing behavior of the u-plane integral at the cusps  = 0, 2. for example, at
 = 0 one can see that (2.9) has a discontinuous behavior for   h 2(x, zz) + w2(x)/2
(i.e. a spinc structure on x) such that 2 < 0, and    = 0. these are precisely the
conditions for sw wall-crossing. the discontinuity is given by:

3. donaldson invariants of product ruled surfaces

in this section we will derive explicit results for the donaldson invariants on product
ruled surfaces, that is, on four-manifolds of the form x = g  s2, where g is a riemann
surface of genus g. for these surfaces, b1 = 2g, b2 = 2, b+
2 = 1, so  = 0 and  = 4  2b1.
h 2(x, zz) is generated by the cohomology classes [s2], [g], with intersection form

ii 1,1 =(cid:18) 0

1

1

0(cid:19) .

(3.1)

these surfaces are spin, therefore w2(x) = 0. the basis of one forms on g  s2 is given
by the duals to the usual symplectic basis of one cycles on g, i, i = 1, . . . , 2g, with
i  i+g = 1, i = 1, . . . , g. the matrix aij is then the symplectic matrix j, and  = [s2]
(the poincare dual to the two-homology class of s2). it follows that

 =

gxi=1


i  

i+g.

(3.2)

and vol(tb1) = 1. as it will become clear in the computation, all the donaldson polynomi-

als involving the cohomology classes associated to one-cycles can be expressed in terms of

the sp(2g, zz)-invariant element in evenh1(x, zz) given by  =pg

i=1 ii+g. this element
of a(x) corresponds to the degree 6 dierential form on the moduli space of instantons

given by:

 = 2

gxi=1

i(i)i(i+g).

(3.3)

if we write s = sg + ts2, we see that the generating function that we want to compute is
zdw (p, r, s, t) = dw2(e)

take into account that the 3-class i(i) on the moduli space gives (i/h)

i in the u-plane

integral. therefore, using (3.2), we nd the correspondence

,

(3.4)

and to obtain zdw (p, r, s, t) from the above formulae we just have to change (i/h) by

(3.4) in the u-plane integral. for the seiberg-witten contribution, the modication is very

similar.

as b+

2 = 1, the generating function (or donaldson series) for the donaldson invariants
will be given by the sum of the u-plane integral and the sw contributions. the resulting

donaldson polynomials are not topological invariants.

in this case, it is interesting to

compute the polynomials in limiting chambers, i.e.. in chambers where one of the factors

in the product is very small (and the other factor is then very big). once the invariants

are known in these chambers, we can compute the invariants in any other chamber by

adding a sum of wall-crossings. but the most important reason to study the invariants in

the limiting chambers is that, for special choices of the second stiefel-whitney classes, the

donaldson polynomials have a simple structure. moreover, the connection to fukaya-floer

theory involves the limiting chamber in which g is small.

the limiting chambers can be analyzed in a fairly simple way using the general ex-

pression of the period point, as in [6]:

() =

1
2

(e[s2] + e[g]).

(3.5)

the limiting chambers are   , which correspond to the limit of small volume for s2
and g, respectively. as explained in [6], in the chamber where s2 is small and   ,
the scalar curvature is positive and the seiberg-witten invariants vanish [2]. this has two

important consequences: rst, in this chamber the donaldson invariants are given just by

the u-plane integral. second, the seiberg-witten invariants in any other chamber can be

computed by wall-crossing and they will be given by the topological expression (2.22). in

particular, the sw contribution to the donaldson invariants will be given by wall-crossing

of the u-plane integral at the cusps  = 0, 2, and we can use the simple expression (2.21).

3.1. computing the u-plane integral

we start by computing the u-plane integral. we follow closely the analysis in section

8 of [3]. we rst rewrite (2.9) as

g() =z0(4)\h

dxdy

y3/2 ztb1

f(p, s, , y) ,

(3.6)

where f is given in (2.10) and  is a siegel-narain theta function introduced in [3]:

w2(e).

zu is obtained from g by

zu = ( s, )g()|=0 + 2

dg
d |=0.

(3.7)

(3.8)

(3.9)

next we bring the integral (2.9) over 0(4)\h to an integral over the fundamental domain of
sl(2, zz). recall that a fundamental domain for 0(4) can be obtained from a fundamental
domain f for sl(2, zz) as follows

0(4) \ h = f  (t  f )  (t 2  f )  (t 3  f )  (s  f )  (t 2s  f ),

(3.10)

where t and s are the standard generators of sl(2, zz). the rst four domains correspond
to the cusp at   i and will be referred to as the semiclassical cusp. the domain s  f
corresponds to the cusp at  = 0 (the monopole cusp.) the domain t 2s  f corresponds
to the cusp at  = 2, or dyon cusp.

taking this into account, we can bring the integral (3.6) to the form

dxdy

y2 ztb1

g() =z0(4)\h
f y1/2  =z0(4)\h
where ii = fi y1/2 i denotes the modular forms

dxdy

y2 ztb1 i( ) =zf

dxdy

y2 xi ztb1 ii ( ),

(3.11)

i(,0)( ) = i( ),
i(,1)( ) = i( + 1),
i(,2)( ) = i( + 2),

i(,3)( ) = i( + 3),
im ( ) = i(1/ ),
idy( ) = i(2  1/ ).

(3.12)

13

therefore, the integral splits into 6 integrals over the modular domain of sl(2, zz).

now we can analyze each of these following the general procedure described in section 8

of [3]. from the modular properties of the theta function (3.7)  see for example appendix

b of [3]  one notes that the corresponding theta functions have

where we have taken into account that w2(x) = 0 for product ruled surfaces. the com-
putation of the u-plane integral proceeds as in [3], following a general strategy due to

borcherds [31], which is a generalization of standard techniques in one-loop threshold cor-

rections in string theory  see for example [32]. this strategy is called lattice reduction.

to perform the lattice reduction, one has to choose a reduction vector z in the cohomology

lattice. z must be a primitive vector of zero norm, and the computation using lattice
reduction will be valid in the chamber with (z, )2 very small. we have then two possible
choices of z depending on the limiting chamber we choose: for small g, one has z = [g],
and for small s2 one has z = [s2]. one also chooses another norm zero vector z such
that (z, z) = 1. the value of the u-plane integral depends of course on the value of the
stiefel-whitney class, that we can write as

where ,  = 0, 1. we then write

w2(e) = z + z,

cusp to the integral (3.6) reads, after a poisson summation on n,

(3.16)

we will now analyze the u-plane integral in the two limiting chambers. we rst consider
the case of s2 small. in this case, z = [s2]. the rst thing to notice is that, if  6= 0,
then the cusps at innity do not give any contribution. this is due to the non-zero ri

in the exponentials in (3.16), and it can be proved using the analysis in section 5 of [3].

moreover, the cusps at  = 0, 2 do not contribute either, because the measure in the
u-plane integral goes like qd + . . .. therefore, if (w2(e), [s2]) 6= 0, the u-plane integral
vanishes in the chamber where the volume of [s2] is very small. this is an example of the

vanishing theorem of [3].

we then have to consider only the case of w2(e) = [s2]. in this case, the contribution
comes from the cusps at innity, which have qi = . notice that i = (/2)z for i = (, 1)
and (, 3). it is easy to see that the inclusion of i for these cusps is equivalent to an
extra phase ic. following [3], we now apply the unfolding technique to the integral
(3.16). the action of sl(2, zz) on c and d has two classes of orbits: non-degenerate orbits

with c, d not both zero, and the degenerate orbit with c = d = 0. non-degenerate orbits
can be transformed by sl(2, zz) to have c = 0, giving an integral over a strip 0  x  1 in
the upper half plane, together with a sum over d  zz\{0}. in this case, the contribution of
the degenerate orbit can be combined with the contribution of the non-degenerate orbits.

as c = 0 in any case, the four cusps at innity give the same contribution and they add to

(3.22)

where we used again the identity (3.20) with  = . this changes the coth in a csc. for
g = 0, one recovers the expressions for s2  s2 which were obtained in [3][33].

let us now consider the other limiting chamber, in which the volume of g is small.
we then have z = [g]. we will also restrict ourselves to the stiefel-whitney classes of
the form w2(e) = [s2] + [g], i.e.,  = 1. the reason for this is simple:
in this case,
ri = 1 for the cusps at innity and the vanishing argument of [3] applies. therefore, there
is no contribution from these cusps. in other words, (i , [g]) 6= 0 and there is a non-zero
magnetic ux through the vanishing ber g. notice that this does not imply that the

whole u-plane integral is zero. as it has been already remarked at the end of section 5 in

[3], the vanishing of the monopole and dyon cusps depends crucially on the behavior of

the measure.

let us then focus on the contribution from the monopole cusp (the contribution from

the dyon cusp is related to that of the monopole cusp by (2.19)). it is easy to see that we
can absorb the m dependence in (3.16) in a shift d  d  1
2 plus an extra  -independent
phase ic. we can now apply the unfolding procedure. the shift in d is crucial to the
nal result. there is a subtlety here, since c and d come in the combination c + d, where
2 . sl(2, zz) elements (cid:18)  
(cid:19) with  odd make c half-integer (and hence not
d = d  1
zero) and those with  even result in d  zz. both problems are related and can be solved
2 )  zz  1
as follows. if  is odd, c = c + (d  1
2 . looking back to (3.16), we see that
a half-integer c corresponds to having a non-zero ux through the vanishing ber, so the
integral corresponding to those values of c vanishes. if  is even, then, as    = 1
(which means in particular that  and  are coprime),  is necessarily odd, and the integral
2 or d  zz.
vanishes as well. so we do not get any contribution from orbits with c  zz + 1
therefore, the nal result is the same as in equation (c.2) in [3] (with minor changes):

(3.30)

where we have used that 2

0 = w2(e)2/4 (mod zz) = /2 (mod zz). the rst piece
corresponds to the monopole cusp at  = 0, while the second one corresponds to the dyon

cusp at  = 2. notice that in the above expression we have not included the term m = 0

in the sum which comes from the expansion (3.27). this is due to the fact that this term
has an overall f 1
2m = qd +   . as the rest of the modular forms are analytic in qd, there
can not be any q0
d term in the expansion, so this term does not contribute.

3.2. the seiberg-witten contribution

let us now turn to the seiberg-witten contribution. as we have already remarked, the
seiberg-witten invariants vanish in the chamber of small volume for s2, and the seiberg-
witten invariants in the chamber where vol(g)  0 are given by the sum of wall-crossing
terms of the form (2.22). but these terms match the wall-crossings at the cusps  = 0, 2 of

the u-plane integral. therefore, the sw contribution to the donaldson invariants is given

by the sum of wall-crossings (2.21). which walls do we cross in going from the limiting
chamber where vol(s2)  0 to the chamber where vol(g)  0? any  with 2 < 0 and
d = 2  (2 + 3)/4 = 2 + 2(g  1)  0 denes a wall. if we set  = b[g] + a[s2],
a, b  zz, these conditions give:

0 < ab  g  1.

(3.32)

we then see that, for a xed genus g, there is only a nite number of walls for the seiberg-

witten contribution. this is in sharp contrast with the wall-crossing terms coming from

the cusps at innity, analyzed in [6], where there is an innite number of walls. notice
that  and  dene the same wall, but the wall-crossing term has opposite sign. we then
obtain the following expression for the seiberg-witten contribution:

where again the rst piece corresponds to the monopole cusp, and the second piece to the

dyon cusp. the sgn(a) appears because, as we explained before, the wall-crossing terms
corresponding to  and  have opposite sign. the overall sign can be xed by looking at
the sign of the seiberg-witten invariants in the wall-crossing formula of [30]. notice that
the constraint g  1  ab is in fact redundant, as the whole expression above vanishes if
this constraint is not fullled. this is due to the fact that the most negative power of qd
in the above expression comes from f g1
d (1 + o(qd)). therefore, if ab > g  1,
there are no terms in q0
d.

2m = q1g

the donaldson-witten generating function in the chamber where g is small, and for
w2(e) = [s2] + [g], is then given by the sum of (3.33) and (3.31), and we will denote it
by z
(p, r, s, t) can be also computed by adding the generating
g
function in the chamber of small volume for s2 and the innite sum of wall-crossings. the

(p, r, s, t). notice that z
g

resulting expressions were given in [6], in terms of weierstrass  functions. the fact that
the generating functions in [6] are equal to z
g

(p, r, s, t) gives a remarkable identity. they

encode the information about the donaldson invariants in two dierent ways, that we can

call magnetic and electric. we have checked that they give indeed the same invariants

in many cases, but an analytic proof would be rather formidable.

it is interesting to notice that the u-plane integral can be written as

where we have only written the monopole contribution. this piece has the same structure

of the seiberg-witten contribution (3.33), but where the sum is now over an innite
number of basic classes of the form  = n[g], i.e. with b = n  0 and a = 0. similar
considerations have been made in [33] for simply-connected manifolds.

3.3. some properties and examples

an interesting corollary of our computation is that the manifold gs2 is of gth nite
type, when one considers the chamber of small volume for g and a stiefel-whitney class

such that (w2(e), g) = 0. this is an immediate consequence of our expressions. to see

it, notice that both for the u-plane and the sw contributions, the only source of a negative

19

power of qd is the term f2m . the rest of the modular forms involved in our formulae are
analytic in qd. on the other hand, the maximum possible power of f2m is precisely g  1.
as um = 1 + 32qd + . . ., an insertion of (um  1)g in the monopole (respectively, dyon)
contribution to (3.34) or (3.33), will make the generating function vanish. but an insertion
of um  1 is equivalent to acting with


p  2

on the donaldson-witten generating function. we then nd that

(cid:18) 2
p2  4(cid:19)g

z

g(p, r, s, t) = 0.

g is in fact the minimum power we need to kill the generating function, since

z

g(p, r, s, t) =

p2  4(cid:19)g1
(cid:18) 2
(1)+g12g(cid:16)lig(e2t)e2p+st + (1)i1glig(e2it)e2pst(cid:17).

(3.35)

(3.36)

(3.37)

we conclude that g  s2 is of gth nite type for the chamber and the stiefel-whitney
class under consideration. this was proved in [12] for g = 1.

we will now give explicit expressions for the donaldson-witten generating function

at low genus. for g = 1, the seiberg-witten contribution vanishes as there are no walls

(i.e., the conditions (3.32) have no solution). in this case, only the u-plane contributes.

the only polylogarithm involved here is

li1(et) = 

et

(1 + et)2 = 

1

4(cosh(t/2))2 .

(3.38)

it is clear that for g = 1 we only need the rst term in the expansion of the modular forms.

we then nd,

z
1,1(p, r, s, t) = z

u,1(p, r, s, t) = 

1
2

(1)(cid:20) e2p+st

cosh2(t)

cosh2(it)(cid:21) .
+ (1) e2pst

(3.39)

as in this case the manifold has a simple type behavior, we can dene the donaldson series
id = z
dw|p=0. if we write it as a functional on sym(h 2(x, zz)), we nd
from (3.39):

dw|p=0 + 1

(3.40)

where e = w2(e), f = [1], and q is the intersection form. this is in perfect agreement

with the theorem 1.3 in [12].

it is clear that, as we consider larger values of g, the expression for the donaldson-

witten generating function becomes more and more complicated. the main source of

this complexity is the t-dependence in the u-plane integral. for example, for g = 2 the

monopole contribution to the u-plane integral is given by:

z

u,m =  (1) e2p+st+2t

16(1 + e2t)4(cid:0)5  5e4t + 16(cid:0)1 + e4t(cid:1) p + 128(cid:0)1 + e2t(cid:1)2

4. application 1: intersection pairings on the moduli space of stable bundles

4.1. the moduli space of stable bundles

let g be a riemann surface of genus g. the moduli space of at so(3) connections
on g, with stiefel-whitney class w2 6= 0 turns out to be a very rich and interesting
space. one of the reasons for this richness is the fact that this moduli space can be

understood in many dierent ways: using the hitchin-kobayashi correspondence, we can

think about this space as the moduli space of rank two, odd degree stable bundles over g

with xed determinant. on the other hand, due to the classical theorem of narashiman

and seshadri, we can identify this moduli space with the representations in su (2) of the
fundamental group of the punctured riemann surface g\dp, where dp is a small disk
around the puncture p, and with holonomy 1 around p (the fact that we require a non-
trivial holonomy is due precisely to the non-zero stiefel-whitney class). in any case, this
moduli space, that we will denote by mg, is a smooth projective variety of (real) dimension
6g  6. similarly, we can consider the moduli space of at su (2) connections, i.e. with
w2 = 0. this moduli space can be identied with the moduli space of stable rank two
vector bundles of even degree and it is singular. we will denote it by m+
g .

the cohomology ring of mg can be studied by using a two-dimensional version of
the  map which arises in donaldson theory. this map sends homology classes of g to

21

 = 2

gxi=1

ii+g.

(4.2)

cohomology classes of mg. the generators of h(g) give in fact a set of generators in
h 4(mg) that are usually taken as follows [16][25]:

 = 2(g)  h 2(mg),
i = (i)  h 3(mg),
 = 4(x)  h 4(mg),

(4.1)

where x is the class of the point in h0(g). we also dene the sp(2g, zz)-invariant coho-
mology class in h 6(mg),

one can show that the moduli space of anti-self-dual connections on gs2 with instanton
number zero is isomorphic to the moduli space of at connections on g. in particular, the
generators of the cohomology in (4.1) correspond precisely to the donaldson cohomology

classes, and we have that

 = 2i(g), i = i(i),  = 4o,

(4.3)

while the invariant form  corresponds to (3.3).

4.2. the intersection pairings

to determine the ring structure of the cohomology of mg, once a set of generators has
been found, one only has to nd a set of relations. due to poincare duality, the intersection

pairings of the generators in (4.1) give all the information needed to nd the relations. in

other words, to nd the structure of the cohomology ring it is enough to evaluate the

intersection pairings

hmnpimg =zmg

m  n  p,

(4.4)

as all the intersection pairings involving the is can be reduced to (4.4) by sp(2r, zz)
symmetry. these numbers can be considered as the two-dimensional analogs of donaldson

invariants, which in fact can be formulated as correlation functions of a two-dimensional

topological gauge theory [17][34]. in [16], thaddeus computed (4.4) in two steps: rst, he

obtained a recursive relation which allows to eliminate the  classes. second, he computed
the pairings hmni using verlindes formula [15]. the same steps are followed by witten
in [17]. we will also prove rst the recursion relation, and then compute the remaining

22

pairings. to do this, we use the donaldson invariants of product ruled surfaces. the

relation between the pairings in (4.4) and the donaldson invariants are as follows (see [25],

remark 13):

hmnpimg = ([s2])dw2=[s2]

gs2 (cid:0)(2g)m(4x)np(cid:1).

(4.5)

in this equation, (w) = (1)
whitney class. this sign appears due to the following reason. the donaldson invariants

, where w is an integer lift of the second stiefel-

k w+w2

2

that appear in the right hand side are dened using the natural orientation of the moduli

space of anti-self-dual connections. for algebraic surfaces, this moduli space can be realized
as the gieseker compactication of the moduli space of rank two stable bundles m(c1, c2),
where c1 = w. this complex space has a natural orientation induced by its complex
structure, and the dierence between these orientations in the computation of the invariants
is given by (w). now, when c2 = 0 and c1 = [s2] (i.e., there is a non-zero ux through
the riemann surface g), then m(0, c1) = mg, and the intersection pairings in the left
hand side are in fact computed with the complex orientation. in this case, ([s2]) = 1.
notice that the pairing above is only dierent from zero when 2m + 4n + 6p = 6g  6.
the donaldson invariants in (4.5) can be computed in any chamber, since for c2 = 0
and w2(e) = [s2] one has p1 = 0 and therefore there are no walls. the computation
turns out to be much simpler in the chamber of small volume for s2. one can make in
principle the computation in the other limiting chamber, using z=0
g

. this turns out to be

very complicated analytically, although we have explicitly checked that the answers agree

in many cases. physically, the computation of thaddeus intersection pairings (as well

as the computation of donaldson invariants involving low instanton numbers) is rather

semiclassical and is best performed in the electric frame, while the magnetic expression
z=0
g

gives information about global aspects of the generating function which are useful,

for example, to compute the eigenvalue spectrum of fukaya-floer cohomology. it has also
been noticed in [22] that in fact, to compute the intersection pairings on mg, the chamber
of small volume for s2 is more natural, as the topological reduction in this chamber gives
the twisted n = 2 yang-mills in two dimensions in a direct way. we will then extract
these pairings from the donaldson invariants given by (3.22).

the rst thing that we can prove is the recursive relation of thaddeus. using the

explicit formula (3.22), one easily sees that


r

zw2(e)=[s2]
g,s2

= 2gzw2(e)=[s2]

g1,s2

,

23

(4.6)

and this implies, using (4.5), that

hmnpimg = 2ghmnp1img1,

(4.7)

which is precisely thaddeus recursive relation.

we now compute the intersection pairings hmni. to do this, we use the expansion:

csc z =

xk=0

(1)k+1(22k  2)b2k

z2k1
(2k)!

,

(4.8)

where b2k are the bernoulli numbers. we have to extract now the powers smpn from
the generating function (3.22). notice that a power sg comes already from the overall
g-dependent factor in (3.22). we then have to extract the power smg from the series

expansion in s/2h. taking now into account the comparison factors from (4.5), and the
dimensional constraint 2m + 4n = 6g  6, one nds

hmni =

1
4

2m(4)nimg+122g+nmm!

(2mg+1  2)
(m  g + 1)!

bmg+1[h3gm2



f g
un

1f 1

2]q0.

(4.9)

fortunately, only the leading term contributes in the q-expansion involved in (4.9). one

nally obtains,

hmni = (1)g

m!

(m  g + 1)!

22g2(2mg+1  2)bmg+1,

(4.10)

which is exactly thaddeus formula for the intersection pairings. this expression, as well as

the recursive relation (4.7), has been obtained by witten in [17] by exploiting the relation

to physical two-dimensional yang-mills theory. a derivation of (4.10) based on gluing

techniques has been worked out in [35].

one can formally consider the intersection pairings in the case of even degree, and

extract them from the donaldson invariants for vanishing stiefel-whitney class. these

invariants are given by (3.21). using now the expansion

coth z =

22kb2k

z2k1
(2k)!

,

xk=0

(4.11)

and taking into account that (0) = 1, one nds

hmni = (1)g

m!

(m  g + 1)!

24

2m+g1bmg+1.

(4.12)

these are also the pairings that one obtains using two-dimensional gauge theory [17][34].

however, one has to be extremely careful about the mathematical interpretation of (4.12),
since the space m+
g is singular for g  3. to dene the intersection pairings one has then
to use intersection cohomology [36] or consider a partial desingularization of mg that has
only orbifold singularities [37]. the computation of the intersection pairings for the partial

desingularization was performed in [37] using the strategy of [16]. the result agrees with
(4.12) for m  g, but for m < g there are correction terms 7. it would be interesting to see
if these corrections can be obtained using physical methods. in this sense, the approach

in [17] seems more appropriate, as the singular character of the moduli space shows up as

a non-regular term in the partition function.

4.3. relation to verlindes formula

the derivation of the intersection pairings (4.10) in [16] was based in the su (2)

verlindes formula for the wzw model [15]. in fact, one can reverse the logic in [16] and

give a derivation of verlindes formula from the intersection pairings. in this section, we
will closely follow the arguments given in [16] for mg, and we will also show that they can
be formally extended to m+
g .

verlindes formula gives an explicit expression for the number of conformal blocks in

cft. in the case of the su (2) wzw model, the space of conformal blocks at level k (where
k is a positive integer) can be identied with the space of sections of the line bundle lk/2,
where l is a xed line bundle over mg which generates pic(mg)  zz. the canonical
bundle of mg is given by l2. we are interested in computing dimh 0(lk/2, mg). as
explained in [16], this can be done using hirzebruch-riemann-roch. the canonical bundle
of mg is negative, and by the kodaira vanishing theorem one has that h i(lk/2, mg) = 0
for i > 0. we then have,

dim h 0(lk/2, mg) = (lk/2, mg) =zmg

ch lk/2 tdmg.

(4.13)

notice that the cohomology classes involved in hirzebruch-riemann-roch can be expressed

in terms of the generators of the cohomology ring (4.1), and therefore (4.13) can be com-

puted in principle once the intersection pairings are known. explicit expressions for the
characteristic classes of the tangent bundle to mg have been obtained by newstead [38]

7 we are grateful to y.-h. kiem for explaining these issues to us.

25

(see also [39]) and read c1(mg) = 2, p(mg) = ((1 + )2g2. one also has c1(l) = ,
and this gives:

dim h 0(lk/2, mg) =zmg

exp(cid:16) k + 2

2

(cid:17)(cid:18) /2

sinh/2)(cid:19)2g2

.

(4.14)

if we expand the characteristic classes in the right hand side of (4.14), we get a polynomial

in k + 2 of the form

3g3xm=0

p3g3m

(k + 2)m

23g3

m!

zmg

m(3g3m)/2,

(4.15)

where pn is the coecient of xn in the series expansion of (x/ sinh x)2g2. using now
(4.10), it is easy to see that this is the coecient of x3g3 in

(cid:18)

k + 2

2

x(cid:19)g1(cid:18) x

sinh x(cid:19)2g2

(k + 2)x

sinh(k + 2)x

.

(4.16)

an argument due to zagier and explained in [16], proposition (19), shows that this coe-

cient is given by

dim h 0(lk/2, mg) =(cid:18) k + 2

2 (cid:19)g1 k+1xn=1

(1)n+1
k+2 )2g2 ,

(sin n

(4.17)

which is precisely verlindes formula in the case of odd degree.

as we pointed out before, the moduli space of rank two stable bundles of even degree

is a singular space, and in principle the intersection numbers are not well-dened. the

answer (4.12) should be considered as a regularization of these pairings in the context of

the u-plane integral. if we assume that the riemann-roch formula is still valid, one obtains
in fact the usual verlindes formula for su (2) 8. if we consider the expression (4.15) with
the intersection pairings given in (4.12), one nds that the dimension of h 0(lk/2, m+
g ) is
now given by the coecient of x3g3 in

(cid:18)

k + 2

2

x(cid:19)g1(cid:18) x

sinh x(cid:19)2g2

(k + 2)x coth(k + 2)x.

(4.18)

going through the argument in [16], proposition (19), one easily obtains:

dim h 0(lk/2, m+

g ) =(cid:18) k + 2

2 (cid:19)g1 k+1xn=1

1
k+2 )2g2 ,
(sin n

(4.19)

8 this has also been observed in [40][41].

26

which gives the right formula for the number of conformal blocks for the (untwisted) su (2)

case. this computation is, however, formal, as there is no suitable riemann-roch formula
for a singular space like m+
g , one can apply
the kawasaki-riemann-roch formula and relate the intersection pairings to verlindes

g . using the orbifold desingularization of m+

formula (4.19). in fact, this is how the corrections to the pairings (4.12) are obtained in

[37].

5. application 2: fukaya-floer cohomology

5.1. floer cohomology and gluing rules

the floer (co)homology groups of three-manifolds and their relations to donaldson

invariants can be understood in a simple way using the axiomatic approach introduced by

atiyah [42], which in fact is a formalization of heuristic considerations involving path inte-

grals. according to the axiomatic approach, a topological eld theory in 3+1-dimensions is

essentially a functor  from the category of three-dimensional manifolds to the category of
complex vector spaces,  : man(3)  vect, and satisfying certain properties. in the case of
donaldson-witten theory, this functor associates to any compact, oriented three-manifold

y the graded vector space given by the floer homology groups hf(y ). these homol-
ogy groups can be dened by using morse theory with the chern-simons functional on the
moduli space of so(3) connections on y with second stiefel-whitney class w2  h 2(y, zz).
we will be interested here in the gluing rules that relate the ring structure of the

floer homology to the donaldson invariants of four-manifolds. let us consider a four-

manifold x with boundary x = y , together with an element z in a(x). according to

the axiomatic approach, the functor  also assigns to the pair (x, z) a relative invariant
of x, which is an element in the floer homology of y (i.e., (x, z)  (x)). this
relative invariant can be understood in a simple way, as explained in [1], in terms of path-
integrals. let z = si1 . . . sip xnj1 . . . iq be an element of a(x), where si, j are two
and one-homology classes, respectively, and x is the class of the point. this determines a

brst-invariant operator given by the -map, namely

az = i(si1) . . . i(sip )oni(j1) . . . i(iq ).

(5.1)

we then dene the relative invariant through the usual correspondence operators/states

in quantum eld theory:

((x, z))w

x(y ) =zx

[d](cid:12)(cid:12)|y =y

27

estymaz,

(5.2)

which is a functional of the elds restricted to the boundary. in this path integral, one
integrates over all the gauge elds with stiefel-whitney class wx  h 2(x, zz), where wx
restricts to w on y .

there are some extra structures in hf(y ) that will be important to our analysis.

our presentation will closely follow the excellent surveys in [20][23]; for more details, one

can see [43][44]. first of all, there is an associative and graded commutative ring structure
hf(y )  hf(y )  hf(y ). second, as in ordinary homology, one can dene the dual
of hf(y ) to obtain the floer cohomology of y . moreover, if y denotes the manifold
with opposite orientation, one has hf (y )  hf(y ). finally, there is a natural,
non-degenerate pairing h , i : hf (y )  hf(y )  c. when the states in the floer
cohomology are given by relative invariants, this pairing can be understood heuristically

from path integral arguments. consider two manifolds with boundary, x1, x2, such that
x1 = y and x2 = y (i.e., y with the opposite orientation). we can glue the manifolds
together to obtain a closed four-manifold x. there is then a pairing between hf(y ) and
hf(y ) which is given by

h(x1, z1)wx1 , (x2, z2)wx2i =zx

[d]estymaz1az2 .

(5.3)

in other words, the pairing is essentially given by donaldson invariants of the four-manifold

x.

in order to give a precise gluing result, we have to be careful with two things: rst of

all, which is the stiefel-whitney class that one has to pick in order to dene the donaldson
invariant on the right hand side of (5.3)? and, in case b+

2 (x) = 1, in which chamber should
we compute the donaldson invariant? these issues are discussed in [19][43] in detail. to
answer the rst question, consider a w  h 2(x, zz) such that w|y = w2. also consider a
cohomology class []  h 2(x, zz), given as the poincare dual of a two-class  which lies
in the image of i : h2(y, zz)  h2(x, zz), and satisfying w  [] = 1 (mod 2). the pair
(w, ) is called in [19] an allowable pair. one then denes

d(w,)

x

the gluing theorem of [23][43] is then

= dw

x + dw+[]

x

.

h(x1, z1)wx1 , (x2, z2)wx2i = d(w,)

x

(z1z2).

28

(5.4)

(5.5)

2 (x) = 1, then one considers the metric giving a long neck, i.e., one takes x =

if b+
x1  (y  [0, r])  x2, with r very large.

we are interested in the floer (co)homology of y = gs1, with stiefel-whitney class
w2 = [s1]. this manifold has an orientation-reversing dieomorphism given by conjugation
on s1, and therefore there is a natural isomorphism hf (y )  hf(y ). we will work
with the ring cohomology from now on. the rst thing to do is to nd the generators
of this ring. consider the four-manifold with boundary x 0 = g  d2, where d2 is the
two-disk. then, x 0 = g  s1. we can dene relative invariants of x associated to
elements in a(x 0) = a(g). clearly, one has to take w = [d2]  h 2(x 0, z), which
restricts to [s1] at the boundary. the generators of hf (y ) are then given by [23]:

 = 2w(x 0, g)  hf 2(y ),
i = w(x 0, i)  hf 3(y ),
 = 4w(x 0, x)  hf 4(y ),

(5.6)

where g, i and x are the generators of h(g). notice that this basis is very similar
in fact, hf (y ) and h (mg) are isomorphic
to the basis of mg presented in (4.1).
as vector spaces [24]. the product structure in the floer cohomology is given, for these
relative invariants, by w(x 0, z)w(x 0, z) = w(x 0, zz). we will restrict ourselves to
the invariant part of hf (y ) (as in the analysis of the cohomology of mg), which is
generated by ,  and

 = 2

gxi=1

w(x 0, ii+g).

(5.7)

the last ingredient we need is the gluing rule. if we consider the pairing of two relative
invariants constructed from x 0, we will have to glue two copies of x 0 along their bound-
aries. clearly, this gives the closed four-manifold x = g  s2 (where s2 comes from
gluing the two disks along their boundaries s1). the long neck metric is the one that
makes s2 very big, and then corresponds to the chamber where g is small. finally, we
have to specify the allowable pair. in x, w = [s2] restricts to w2 = [s1] on y . on the
other hand, the image of h2(y, zz) in h 2(x, zz) is generated by g. this means that the
gluing rule for the relative invariants is

hw0(x 0, z1), w0(x 0, z2)i = d(w,g)

x

(z1z2) = dw2=[s2]

x

(z1z2) + dw2=[s2]+[g]

x

(z1z2).

(5.8)

29

the fukaya-floer cohomology hf f (y ) of an oriented three-manifold y needs the
extra input of a loop   s1 in y . a review of this construction can be found in [19].
here we will consider that  is the s1 factor in y = g  s1. in this case, one has that
hf f (y ) = hf (y )c[[t]]. a basis of generators can be also constructed using relative
invariants of the manifold x 0, with the insertion of the operator exp ti(d2) in the path

integral. in this way, we obtain the generators

b = 2w0 (x 0, getd2
bi = w0 (x 0, ietd2
b = 4w0 (x 0, xetd2

)  hf f 2(y ),
)  hf f 3(y ),

)  hf f 4(y ).

the gluing rule is now

(5.9)

hw0(x 0, z1etd2

), w0(x 0, z2etd2

)i = d(w,g)

x

(z1z2ets2

),

(5.10)

and therefore the donaldson invariants involved in the fukaya-floer cohomology include
the cohomology class associated to s2. this makes the determination of this cohomology

more dicult.

5.2. eigenvalue spectrum of the fukaya-floer cohomology

as we have seen, the intersection pairings in floer and fukaya-floer cohomology
are given by donaldson invariants of g  s2 in the chamber where g is small. these
invariants completely determine, in principle, the ring structure of the (fukaya)-floer

cohomology, but this does not mean that we are able to give an explicit presentation of the

relations of the ring. already in the comparatively simpler case of the classical cohomology
of mg, to obtain the explicit relations at genus g starting from the intersection pairings
(4.10) turns out to be a very complicated combinatorial problem (solved in [39]). in this

section, we want to show that an important aspect of the ring structure, namely the

eigenvalue spectrum, can be deduced in a simple way from the generating function that

we found in section 2. in the case of floer cohomology, the spectrum was obtained in [22]

under some extra assumptions, and nally derived in [23] from an explicit presentation

of the relations. the spectrum of the fukaya-floer cohomology was conjectured in [19],

based on the computation of the spectrum for a submodule. our calculation conrms this

conjecture. our strategy will be in a way the reverse to that in [20]. in these papers, the

information about fukaya-floer cohomology obtained in [19] is used to understand the

30

structure of donaldson invariants. here, we will use the donaldson invariants of g  s2
to deduce results about the fukaya-floer cohomology of g  s1.

the basic procedure to obtain the eigenvalue spectrum is to nd elements in the ideal

of relations of the fukaya-floer cohomology, i.e., to nd vanishing polynomials in the

generators b, b andb:

p(b,b,b) = 0.

(5.11)

we can easily translate this identity in terms of the generating function for the donaldson
invariants of g  s2: as the pairing (5.3) is non-degenerate, to prove the identity (5.11)
it is enough to prove that

(5.12)
for any z  a(g). due to the gluing rule (5.10), the above pairing is nothing but
d(w,g)
). the vanishing of (5.12) for any z is then equivalent to the

hp(b,b,b), (x 0, zetd2

(5.14). we then have to study the dierential equations satised by our function. first of

(5.17)

let us now concentrate on the eigenvalue spectrum of the fukaya-floer cohomology.

the rst eigenvalue equation we can write is the one that corresponds to the nite-type

condition that we obtained in section 3. it reads now,

(b2  64)g = 0,

therefore the eigenvalues of b must be 8. to understand the eigenvalue spectrum of the

remaining operators, it is useful rst to be more precise about the structure of z(w,g)
we look at (5.15), it is easy to see that it can be written as,

. if

g

z(w,g)

g

= x|a|g1

za(p, r, s, t).

(5.18)

notice that the u-plane integral contribution corresponds to a = 0. the structure of

za(p, r, s, t) is immediate from (5.15):

za(p, r, s, t) =(cid:26) fa(p, r, s, t)e2p+st+2as,

fa(p, r, s, t)e2pst2ias,

for a odd,
for a even,

(5.19)

where fa(p, r, s, t) is a polynomial in p, r and s and a power series in t (similar remarks

about the structure of the donaldson invariants have been made in [20]). we are interested

in the degree of the polynomial in p, r, s. this is again easy to see if we look at the modular

9 for t = 0, the generating function (5.15) can be computed in principle using the artinian de-
composition of the floer cohomology [23]. this procedure, however, does not give a general result

for any genus and has to be worked out case by case. v. munoz has informed us that the above

expressions for g = 2, 3 coincide with the results that can be obtained from this decomposition.

32

forms involved in (5.15). assume g  2 (for g = 1, f0 only depends on t). we know that
the maximum power we can nd in p is precisely g  1 (a simple consequence of the nite
type condition). as one can see in (3.37), this power appears in the u-plane integral
contribution, and for a 6= 0, the maximum power of p is in fact g  2.

let us now nd which is the maximum power of s in fa. if we group the powers of s
in the modular form that gives fa, we easily see that the leading term in qd has the form

qab+1+nm
d

sg+nmtn,

(5.20)

up to numerical constants. it is clear that the maximum possible power of s which can
appear in fa is g |a| 1, and occurs for |b| = 1. this power actually appears in fa: using
the above expression, it is easy to see that

fa(p, r, s, t) = 264g3|a|

for a odd, while for a even one obtains:

fa(p, r, s, t) =

(1)g|a|i|a|264g3|a|

gxn=|a|+1(cid:18)g

n(cid:19)(sgn(a))n+1 (a  2it)n|a|1

(n  |a|  1)!

e2i(sgn(a))tsg|a|1 + . . . .

(5.22)

(5.23)

finally, for a = 0 (the u-plane contribution), one has:

fa(p, r, s, t) = (1)g264g

gxn=1

(1)n(2it)n1

(n  1)!

n(cid:19)lin(e2it)sg1 + . . . .
(cid:18)g

notice that, for a 6= 0, fa(p, r, s, t) is a polynomial in et, while for a = 0 it is a rational
function in these variables.

by similar arguments, one nds that the maximum power of r appears for a = 0 and

is g  1. we then have the following dierential equations for the za:


p


(cid:0)4
za =(cid:0)2
+ 8(cid:1)g1
za =(cid:0)2
p  8(cid:1)g1
(cid:0)4
p  8(cid:1)g
(cid:0)4

za = 0,

a odd

za = 0,

a even, a 6= 0,

.

(5.24)

z0 = 0,

a = 0

notice that the powers that appear in these equations are in fact the minimum powers

that are needed to kill the za, as it can be easily seen from (5.21)(5.22) and (5.23). we
also have

g
rg z(w,g)

g

= 0,

(5.25)

which is also the minimum power we need (rg1 appears for a = 0, while for a 6= 0 the
maximum power is rg2). notice, in particular, that (b  8)g kills all the za with a odd

(even, respectively). we can now deduce the eigenvalue spectrum of the fukaya-floer

cohomology. from (5.24) and (5.25) we nd the following operator equations:

ya odd

(b  4a  2t)g|a| ya even

bg =0,
(b + 4ia + 2t)g|a| =0.

(5.26)

therefore, the only eigenvalue ofb is 0, and forb we nd the eigenvalue spectrum (0, 4 +
2t, 8i  2t,   ). notice that the eigenvalue 8 of b only occurs for b = 4ia  2t, with a
even. in the same way, we nd that 8 only occurs for b = 4a + 2t, for a odd. this is due

to the equation

(5.27)

(b + 8)g ya even

(b + 4ia + 2t)g|a| = 0,

and a similar equation involving (b  8)g. recalling now that (g  1)  a  g  1, our
main conclusion is that the eigenvalue spectrum of (b,b,b) is given by

(4(g  1)ig + (1)g2t, (1)g18, 0).

(4 + 2t, 8, 0),

(0, 8, 0),

(5.28)

. . .

this generalizes proposition 20 in [23], and conrms the conjecture in [19] (see theorem

5.13 and remark 5.14 in that paper). it is easy to give an explicit construction of the

eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues. they are given by:

, a even,

(5.29)

a odd.

va =

(cid:0)b + 8(cid:1)g(cid:0)b + 4ia + 2t(cid:1)g|a|1q a even, a6=a
(cid:0)b  8(cid:1)g(cid:0)b  4a  2t(cid:1)g|a|1q a odd, a6=a

|a|g1 (cid:0)b + 4ia + 2t(cid:1)g|a|
|a|g1 (cid:0)b  4a  2t(cid:1)g|a|

,

to see that these vectors are in fact not zero, one can easily prove that hva, (x 0, zets2
i 6= 0
for any z  a(x), using the explicit results for the generating function (5.15) in (5.21),
(5.22) and (5.23).

using now arguments from [22][23][45], together with our results, it is easy to rederive
the presentation of the floer cohomology of g  s1 given in [22][23]. we will give some

34

brief indications on this respect. let jg be the ideal of relations at genus g (jg is then
generated by all the polynomials in , ,  that vanish as elements of the invariant part of
hf ). first of all, notice that z(w,g)

satises

g


r

z(w,g)

g

= 2gz(w,g)

g1

,

this implies immediately the following inclusion relation:

jg  jg+1  jg.

(5.30)

(5.31)

now one can use the fact that the floer cohomology of y = g s1 is a deformation of the
cohomology of mg (this is rather elementary and does not assume the existence of a ring
isomorphism between hf (y ) and the quantum cohomology of mg). using the explicit
recursive presentation of the ring cohomology of mg given in [39][46], and adapting the
arguments of proposition 3.2 in [45], one obtains the following result: the ideal of relations
is given by jg = (q1
relations:

g, i = 1, 2, 3, are given by the following recursive

g), where the qi

g, q3

g, q2

q1
g+1 = q1

g + g2q2
g ,

q2
g+1 = ( + cg+1)q1

g +

2g

g + 1

q3
g ,

g+1 = q1
q3
g.

(5.32)

when cg+1 = 0, one recovers the classical cohomology of mg. the deformation is then
encoded in the coecient cg+1. notice that the key fact which is used to derive (5.32) is the

inclusion of ideals (5.31), which is in turn a consequence of (5.30). this recursion relation

was conjectured in [45] for the generating function of the gromov-witten invariants of
mg, and provides in that context a generalization of thaddeus recursion relation (4.7)
from the classical to the quantum pairings.

the last ingredient is then to compute the value of the coecient cg+1. it was shown
in [23] that this value can be easily deduced by induction using the eigenvector that corre-

1

sponds to the maximum -eigenvalue. for g = 1, one immediately nds from (5.15) that
z(w,1)
= e2p (we are putting t = 0, as we are considering the floer rather than the
fukaya-floer cohomology). it then follows that  = 8, so c1 = 8. the argument in [23],
theorem 14, gives then cg = (1)g8.

it would be interesting to use the information contained in (5.15) to give a recursive

presentation like (5.32) but for the fukaya extension. some steps in this direction have been

35

taken in [19]. in principle, all the information that one needs is contained in the generating

function (5.15), but it is still a non-trivial problem to extract it in the particular form of

an explicit presentation of the relations.
