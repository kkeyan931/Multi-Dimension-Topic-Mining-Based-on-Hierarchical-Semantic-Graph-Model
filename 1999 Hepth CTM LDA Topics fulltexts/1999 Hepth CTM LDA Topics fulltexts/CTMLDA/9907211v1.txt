abstract

we conjecture that the senseiberg limit of the type iia d2brane action in a at space-

time background can be resummed, at all orders in , to dene an associative star product on

the membrane. this star product can be independently constrained from the equivalent ma-

trix theory description of the corresponding m 2brane, by carefully analyzing the known bps

conditions. higher derivative corrections to the borninfeld action on the iia side are rein-

terpreted, after the senseiberg limit, as higher derivative corrections to a eld theory on the

membrane, which itself can be resummed to yield the known matrix theory quantum mechanics

action. conversely, given the star product on the membrane as a formal power series in , one

can constrain the higher derivative corrections to the borninfeld action, in the senseiberg

limit. this claim is explicitly veried to rst order. finally, we also comment on the possible

application of this method to the derivation of the matrix theory action for membranes in a

curved background.

introduction and discussion

it is by now clear that string theory as it emerged in the eighties is but a fraction of the full story.

the ve known superstring theories as well as the lowenergy 11dimensional supergravity are

now known to be related through a web of dualities [1], and it is believed that all these theories

are simply dierent limits of an underlying 11dimensional quantum theory known as m theory,

whose fundamental degrees of freedom are as yet unknown. throughout these string theories

we have dbranes of various dimensions [2], playing in certain regimes a role as fundamental

as that of the basic string. these dbranes have a precise description within string theory,

their lowenergy dynamics being dictated by the borninfeld action [18] which can be obtained

using boundary conformal eld theory techniques. m theory itself contains m 2branes and

m 5branes, which themselves can be related to the branes in string theories [6].

the problem of understanding the structure of string theory, is directly related to a full

understanding of what is the fundamental nature of spacetime. at large distances the structure

of the spacetime manifold is well described by riemannian geometry. on the other hand, at

small distances  i.e., much shorter than the string scale s  the riemannian description of

spacetime breaks down. in fact, there is as yet no known intrinsic and covariant description of

the underlying geometry and fundamental degrees of freedom. despite this lack of understand-

ing of the small distance structure, one can use dbranes in order to probe physics at distances

smaller than the string length [8].

in this work, we shall focus our attention on the description of the m theory m 2brane. let

us rst recall that m theory compactied on a circle is described by type iia string theory at

nite string coupling [1]. moreover, the (unwrapped) m 2brane corresponds, in the type iia

description, to the dirichlet membrane. it is by now a well known conjecture that m theory

compactied on a lightlike circle admits a nonperturbative description in terms of the degrees

of freedom of a collection of d0branes [6, 7]. moreover, these d0branes are exactly described

by the (0 + 1)dimensional reduction of 10dimensional u (n ) super yangmills theory. a

precise understanding of this matrix theory conjecture is obtained by starting with m theory,

now compactied on a spacelike circle, and considering the sector with n units of momenta

in the compact direction. from a iia point of view this corresponds to the sector of the theory

with n d0branes. one then uses the poincare invariance of the underlying m theory in order

to relate the spacelike compactied theory to the theory compactied on the lightcone. this

is achieved by both sending the spacelike compactication radius to zero and, at the same time,

1

by rescaling the 11dimensional planck length. such a prescription is known as the senseiberg

limit [5, 4].

membranes exist in both type iia string theory and in m theory. in particular, one should

be able to describe m 2branes as specic states within matrix theory. on the other hand, d2

branes can be described within type iia string theory in terms of the geometry of a world

volume manifold embedded in spacetime, whose dynamics are governed at low energies by the

borninfeld action and in general, at weak coupling, by the full  expansion of the boundary

state conformal eld theory [18]. naively one would assume that these two descriptions should

be essentially the same  i.e., they should coincide in the senseiberg limit. on the other hand,

a closer look shows that these descriptions are actually valid in seemingly dierent regimes.

in fact, matrix theory probes the dynamics of the d0branes at the planckian length which,

in the senseiberg limit, is much smaller than the string length. the  expansion is, on the

other hand, a large distance expansion therefore valid in the opposite regime. still, we shall

conjecture in this work that one can learn about one description from the other. in particular,

the exact knowledge of the matrix theory action can be used to conjecture the senseiberg

limit of the action describing the d2brane to all orders in   i.e., borninfeld plus higher

derivative corrections. conversely, one could proceed the other way around and use extensions

of known results [15] in order to start tackling the problem of describing matrix theory in curved

backgrounds. indeed one could use conformal eld theory calculations in order to determine

the  corrections to the borninfeld action in a curved background. then, via the prescription

described in this paper, one could take the senseiberg limit and obtain the rst corrections to

matrix theory in this curved background [9, 10, 11, 12, 14].

let us now be a bit more specic. in order to carry out the above program, we shall start by

considering static bps membranes in matrix theory. at the classical level, in at background

spacetime, these membranes are described by holomorphic curves. using the work of cornalba

and taylor [16], one can represent any holomorphically embedded curve via matrices  i.e., we

can construct its matrix representation. this construction is accomplished by starting with

a given holomorphic embedding and then associating functions on the membrane to matrices,

so that matrix multiplication is represented by an associative star product on the space of

functions. this star product is clearly noncommutative and, moreover, it is given by a formal

power expansion in  = 3

p /r, which at each order is given by a local derivative bilinear of the
functions living on the membrane. the product starts as simple function multiplication, and is

constrained at higher orders by the following three conditions. first, the star commutator of

2

functions starts at order  with the poisson bracket, where the symplectic form is determined by

the area element of the embedded curve. secondly, and as previously stated, the product should

be associative. finally, the coordinate functions which represent at the matrix level the static

curve, should satisfy the bps condition which follows from the known matrix theory action.

as described in [16] these three conditions can be iteratively solved (algebraically) in powers of

, if one considers the specic case of holomorphic quantization for the bps membranes.

having described the static bps branes, we now proceed by considering uctuations about

these solutions. fluctuations can again be represented dually either as matrices or as functions

on the brane.

in particular, if we consider the uctuating coordinates as functions and we

rewrite the matrix theory action in terms of the star product, one immediately gets an action

in terms of higher derivatives of these coordinates functions and in powers of . it is then very
natural to conjecture that this expansion is nothing but the senseiberg limit of the full 

expansion describing the d2brane.

what we do in this paper is, rst of all, to describe in detail the correct senseiberg limit of

the d2brane action. we then apply this procedure to the borninfeld action and show that,

in the limit, it reproduces exactly the lightcone gauge xed nambugoto m 2brane action in

11dimensions. this is, as expected, the rst term in the previously described expansion of the

matrix theory action as given in terms of the star product. finally, we describe how one should

proceed in order to test the conjecture at higher orders in , and moreover how one can infer

higher derivative terms in the d2brane action from a given star product.

the picture that emerges from this conjecture is the following. each derivative correction to

the borninfeld action translates into a correction to the eective eld theory on the m 2brane.

the sum of all these derivative corrections on the d2brane action translate to an innite sum

of corrections to the eld theory on the m 2brane, in such a way that, in the senseiberg

limit, they can be reorganized into a star product. this reduces the nonrenormalizable eld

theory on the m 2brane to a matrix quantum mechanics. moreover, this star product can be

independently constrained by analyzing the bps condition arising from matrix theory.

while this paper was being typed, we learned about other work along similar lines [29].

2 the senseiberg limit of the borninfeld action

our ultimate goal is to show how one can relate the action for an m theory membrane to

the action describing a d2brane in type iia string theory. to this end, we have to analyze

3

the senseiberg limit and precisely understand how it relates states in lightcone compactied

m theory to states in type iia theory.

in this section in particular, we shall consider the

motion of an m 2brane as described by the nambugoto action and we will show that the

dynamics can be determined from the borninfeld action describing the d2brane through a

precise understanding of its senseiberg limit.

we start, in order to introduce notation1, by reviewing the standard lightcone description
of m theory in a at background. transverse coordinates will be denoted by x i , i = 1, . . . , 9,
while lightcone ones by x = 21/2(x 0  x 10). also, p will denote the planck length, and
r the lightlike compactication radius in the x direction. to describe the motion of an

m 2brane (we shall always consider m 2branes which do not wrap the compact direction),
we take the worldvolume of the membrane to be the product space r  , where  is a two
dimensional surface with the topology of the brane. coordinates on the worldvolume are  and
a (with a = 1, 2) or, collectively,  (with  = 0, 1, 2). the motion of the surface is described
by coordinate functions x  : r    r11 on the worldvolume, and the correct dynamics is
determined, at low energy, by the minima of the membrane nambugoto action,

where g = x x is the induced metric, and the tension t of the brane is given by

s = tz d3q det g ,

t =

1

(2)2p

3 .

in order to simplify the highly nonpolynomial nambu-goto action, we can use the dieo-

morphism invariance on the brane worldvolume.

in fact, it is well known [21, 22] that the

propagation of the m 2brane is most conveniently described in the lightfront gauge, where the
independent degrees of freedom are the transverse embedding coordinates x i and the remaining
light-front coordinates x are given by the gauge constraints x + =  and ax = x iax i.
the dynamics of the system is then governed by the lagrangian [21, 22]

l =

where d2 q is a xed volume form on the manifold  describing the brane and

1we will use the following index conventions. indices in m theory spacetime will be , , . . ., and on the brane

worldvolume will be , , . . .. spatial indices on the brane worldvolume will be a, b, . . ., and spatial directions

in iia (or equivalently transverse directions in m theory) will be i, j, . . ..

is the poisson bracket corresponding to the volume form. the overall normalization of the

action has been chosen so that, when considering static solutions of the equations of motion,

the area element q d2 corresponds to the area element of the brane given by the embedding

in the transverse directions. more precisely, if

then, for solutions such that x =  and x i = 0, we have that q = det hab. more generally

hab = ax ibx i ,

q =s det hab

.

finally, let us recall that, in order to solve the gauge constraint ax = x iax i, we clearly
have to restrict our attention to solutions satisfying the constraint

we now wish to rederive the above description of the m 2brane, now starting from the known

{x i,

x i} = 0 .

(2)

moreover, in order to match energy levels [4, 5], we need to consider m theory with a new

duality between m theory and type iia [1]. first, let us recall [6, 7, 4, 5] that m theory
compactied on the lightlike circle x  x + 2r can be described as the limit of m theory
compactied on a spacelike circle of radius er, where we take the senseiberg limit er  0.
planck length fp , where we keep the ratio r/2
refer to the spacelike compactied theory as fm . in order to describe the above limit in detail,
we introduce a dimensionless parameter   0, and we then take

constant. in the following, we shall

2

p = er/fp

if we denote by ex  the spacetime coordinates in the fm theory, we have the relations

fp = 2p ,

er = 4r .

ex 0 = x + ,
ex 10  ex 10 + 2er ,
ex i = 2x i .

5

consider, in particular, a state in the theory m with momentum p . the momentum p +

corresponding to the compact direction x will be quantized as

p + =

n
r

.

moreover, the corresponding state in the fm theory will have momentum ep , where

ep 0 = n/er + p +
ep 10 = n/er
ep i = 2p i .

(3)

recall that m theory compactied on a spacelike circle is given by type iia string theory

at nite coupling [1]. therefore, in order to describe the fm  theory with n units of momentum

in the compact direction, one needs to consider type iia with n units of d0brane charge and

with the following string length and coupling

where we have introduced the constants

es = s

egs = 3gs ,

related to the original lightlike compactied m theory. finally, we introduce the constants

 = 22(2) ,

and the corresponding tilded quantities

in particular, the constant  is introduced to make contact with [16, 17]. it plays the role of

,

e = 2

e = 2 .

, but it is more convenient to use, since it absorbs the factor of 2, which would otherwise

appear explicitly in most of the equations that follow.

let us now focus our attention on the description of brane states.

in particular, let us
start by concentrating on static bps branes in m theory, given by embeddings x () which
satisfy x =  and x i = 0, and which represent holomorphic maps of the manifold  in the

6

transverse space x i (as described in detail in [16]). following the senseiberg limit described

previously, we can consider the corresponding bps brane states within the theory fm , or better

yet, within the corresponding type iia description. in particular, let us rst introduce the

rescaled coordinates on the world-volume of the brane

e  (e , ea) ,
e = 

,

ea = 2a .

we are then considering, within the type iia description, a single static d2brane given by

the embedding

ex 0(e) = x +() = 
ex i(e) = 2x i() .

moreover, since in the original m theory description the lightcone momentum p + of the
brane is given by p + = 21/2 p 0 = 21/2 t a (a denotes the area of the membrane), and since
p + = n/r, we must consider the sector of type iia with

n =

1
2

t ar

(4)

units of d0brane charge.

as is well known [18], the motion of a d2brane is described, in the lowenergy limit, by

the borninfeld (bi) action

where the tension of the brane is given by

es = etz d3er det(cid:16)eg + 2eef(cid:17) ,

and the induced metric by

3 = 6t

et =

1

(2)2egses

(5)

this action, however, needs to be corrected at length scales comparable to the string length.

eg = eex 0e ex 0 + eex ie ex i .

these corrections take the form of terms with higher derivatives of the embedding functions

7

and of the brane maxwell eld strength [28]. nonetheless, for the case we are now considering

of static bps states, one may only consider the bi action, since higher derivative terms do

not change the nature of the bps solutions [19, 20]. in particular, we have already seen that
the embedding functions are given by a holomorphic map from  to x i. one then only needs

to determine the correct maxwell eld on the membrane which describes the corresponding

m 2brane state. recalling that ef measures d0brane density on the d2brane, and using

equation (4), we must have that

it is not dicult to see that the correct solution to the bi action which satises the above

2z ef12 d2 = n =

normalization is given by

where, as before, q d2 is the induced area element on the brane. we then have that for the

(6)

let us now consider uctuations around the static solution, within the type iia description.

in order to make contact with the lightcone description of the m 2brane, we shall use part

moreover, using timedependent reparametrizations of the brane  (which leave invariant the

of the reparametrization invariance of the bi action. in particular, we shall keep ex 0 = e =  .
constraint ex 0 =  ), one can cancel any uctuations ef of the u (1) eldstrength ef + ef.
this can be achieved by eliminating, rst of all, the electric part ef0a with a  dependent

reparametrization, using the fact that we are working in a background with a large magnetic

eld (6). one can then use a  independent reparametrization to eliminate the magnetic part

can use dieomorphism invariance on the worldvolume to bring any given conguration of the

ef12. this can be done since, in 2dimensions, any two area elements (given in this case by
ef12 d2e and by (ef12 + ef12) d2e) are always equivalent under reparametrization. therefore, we
d2brane into a conguration with gauge eld strength given by (6) and with ex 0 =  .

one then only needs to consider uctuations in the embedding functions. we consider

generic transverse embedding functions

8

recalling that we are always looking at uctuations which are nite from an m 2brane point of

ex i(e) = 2x i() ,

view, and are therefore nite in units of the planck length. in units of the string length, these

uctuations are vanishingly small. the induced metric eg is given by

eg =  1 + e0ex ie0ex i
eaex iebex i  =
e0ex iebex i
e0ex ieaex i
ax ibx i  = 1 + 4 x i x i 2 x ibx i
=  1 + 4 x i x i 2 x ibx i

2 x iax i

2 x iax i

 ,

where, as before, hab = ax ibx i is the spatial part of the induced metric. we now wish to

evaluate the bi action (5) in the presence of uctuations. on general grounds one expects, in

the limit of vanishingly small , that

es =z d(cid:18)

n

er

+ l + o()(cid:19) ,

corresponding to the fact that the energies in type iia are related to the lightcone momenta in

m theory by ep 0 = n/er + p + (eq. 3). in the above equation, l represents the lagrangian in

the m theory limit, and we shall show that it corresponds to the lagrangian (1). to compute

the bi action, we introduce the shorthand notation

given the choice of gauge previously described, we have that

m =eh + 2eef .

we recover the lagrangian (1).

to conclude this section we would like to derive, within the type iia description, the

constraint (2) which is an integral part of the lightcone lagrangian (1). recall that we have

used dieomorphism invariance of the bi action to gauge away the uctuations in the u (1)

be reinterpreted as a constraint on the allowed congurations of the lagrangian system under

eldstrength. invariance of the action es under innitesimal uctuations of ef should then
consideration. in particular, we shall show that invariance of es under innitesimal uctuations
of the electric eld will yield, in the   0 limit, the constraint (2) on the embedding functions.
start by considering a generic uctuation ef = a  a. then
es + es  z d3r det(cid:16)m + ef(cid:17)
es  z d3q det m m ef .

it is easy to see that, to leading order in , the inverse matrix m  is given by (we only show

the elements of the inverse matrix which will enter in the computation that follows)

let us now concentrate on the precise form of the innitesimal uctuation ef. first of all we

can use u (1) gauge invariance to move to the a0 = 0 gauge. moreover, since we are considering

purely electric uctuations, we have that 1a2 = 2a1. therefore aa = af . if we let  = 0f ,

we have that

we can then use equation (7) to show that

since  is arbitrary, we recover the constraint,

as given in equation (2).

3 higher derivative corrections to the borninfeld and the

star product

this nal section is devoted to a qualitative discussion on the higherorder corrections to

the borninfeld (bi) action and to the analysis of their senseiberg limit. the limit will be

reinterpreted as a matrix theory action living on the worldvolume of the m 2-brane.

let us start by recalling the matrix theory lagrangian [6, 7]

it is given by the dimensional reduction of 10dimensional u (n ) symtheory to (0 + 1)

dimensions. it is the lowenergy limit of the bi action describing the degrees of freedom of n

d0branes and it has been conjectured [6, 7] to be an exact nonperturbative description of

lightcone compactied m theory, in the sector with n units of momentum in the compact

direction. the lagrangian (8) should be supplemented with the constraint

[x i,

x i] = 0 ,

which comes from the choice of temporal gauge in the sym theory. the conjecture itself can

again be understood in terms of the senseiberg limit described in the previous section [4, 5].

the lagrangian (8) should contain all of the physics of m theory. in particular, it should

describe sectors of the theory with nite m 2brane charge. let us consider, to start, a specic

bps m 2brane, described at the classical level by a holomorphic curve in the transverse space.

to be denite, introduce the complex coordinates s = 1 + i2 and z1 = x 1 + ix 2, z2 =

x 3 + ix 4, . . ., so that the coordinate functions za are analytic in s. it was shown in [16] that

we can associate to each such curve a specic bps state in matrix theory, which gives a matrix

representation of the given holomorphic brane. we shall not review here the construction given

in [16], but we will quickly describe what is needed for the discussion of this section. in [16],
given a xed bps brane, a map q was constructed which associates to each function a on the
brane  a matrix q(a) (or better an operator on a given hilbert space). the map q has the
property that, given any two functions a, b on , on has

q(a)q(b) = q(a  b) + o() ,

(9)

where  is a specic associative star product associated with the given curve, which we shall

describe in detail in what follows. as indicated above, the equality in equation (9) is asymptotic

in , and is valid only up to corrections which vanish faster then any power of .

in this

paper we shall not be interested in nonperturbative eects in  and will therefore ignore such

corrections, treating the equality in (9) as exact. in this case, we can speak interchangeably of

functions on the brane together with a given star product, or of matrices together with matrix

multiplication. in order to make contact with the membrane theory of the last section, it is

clear that the description in terms of functions on the brane is the preferable one, and we will,

from now on, consider matrices as functions on  (with the product ).

let us now describe star products in detail. a product a  b is given as a formal power

12

series pn=0 nsn(a, b) in , where at each order the coecient sn(a, b) is a local bilinear in

a and b, built out of the derivatives of a and b up to nite order. in particular, we will have,

s0(a, b) = ab

s1(a, b)  s1(b, a) =

1
2i{a, b} .

(10)

as is well known [23, 24, 25, 26], the condition of associativity puts stringent constraints on the

explicit form of the coecients sn.

we shall further constrain the star product by demanding that it preserves the bps nature

of the holomorphic brane which we are describing. in particular, the supersymmetry transfor-

mations of the lagrangian (8) are known and simple, and one can show [16] that the correct

bps conditions which are appropriate for a supersymmetric membrane state are given by

[za, zb] = [za, zb] = 0

xa

[za, za] =  .

(11)

imposing the above equations gives an extra constraint on the star product on the brane. it is

carefully shown in [16] that the conditions above are solved by the following product

a  b =

xn=0

a(cid:19) (cid:18) 1

the coecients qn are (1, 1) tensors on the brane, which can be computed recursively starting

from q1 with the formula,

qn = q1 + qn1 +    log(q1  qn1) .

the tensor q1 can, in turn, be computed perturbatively in  by imposing equation (11) and is

given by

q1 = q +


2

  log q + o(2) .

let us also briey discuss traces of operators. the major fact is that, again asymptotically

in , they can be computed as integrals over the surface ,

we now arrive to the fundamental point of this paper. one starts with a static bps solution

and considers the physics of the uctuations, as governed by the lagrangian (8). if one considers

the uctuations not as matrices but, in the spirit of what we have just discussed, as functions

on the brane , and if morover one replaces matrix products by star products and traces with
integrals, one can rewrite the action (8) as a eld theory on   r governing the uctuations
of the brane itself. using equations (10,12), we have

a  b  ab +

therefore the matrix theory action (8) has an  expansion which starts as

the above reproduces the action (1), if one recalls that rt = 2. moreover, the full gauge
constraint [ x i, x i] = 0 for the matrix theory lagrangian does imply, to leading order in , the
constraint { x i, x i} = 0 discussed in the last section.

let us analyze higher order terms. from the point of view of the d2brane action, one

must understand the structure of the terms which involve higher derivatives of the embedding

coordinates (curvature terms) and of the gauge eld strength. these terms must be analyzed

in the limit of very large background constant eldstrength, as is clear from equation (6),

even though we can work order by order in derivatives. since we are working in the limit of

vanishing string coupling, one can analyze openstring disk diagrams, where the underlying

cft is that of a string ending on a brane with a constant eldstrength. derivative corrections

to the eective action can then be analyzed by computing standard string amplitudes, in the

presence of the given background. at rst sight we expect the derivative corrections to the bi

14

action to diverge in the senseiberg limit. indeed, we expect for example terms containing the

curvature of the brane, measured in units of the string length. since the characteristic length

scale of the brane is proportional, in the senseiberg limit, to the planck length, and since the

in the limit. however, in this argument we are neglecting the fact that we are working in a

string length es   is large compared to ep  2, one expects curvature terms to dominate
background of large gauge eld strength 2eef  1/2. the curvature corrections can then

be altered by inverse powers of the constant background gauge eld strength (as can be seen

by looking at the propagator in the boundary cft in the presence of a background f ), thus

yielding a nite result.

it is therefore natural to conjecture the following. the senseiberg limit of the action

describing the d2brane in type iia string theory can be resummed to all orders in . the

full sum can be then rewritten as the action (8) describing matrix theory, where one interprets

matrix multiplication as an associative star product on the brane worldvolume. the star product

itself must, for consistency reasons, satisfy the conditions (10) and (11).

let us conclude by commenting on some questions of uniqueness. in section 2 we carefully

constructed the senseiberg limit by imposing the constraint (6). this clearly depends on the

exact denition of the u (1) gauge eld living on the brane. in particular, recall that one can

always do a eld redenition of the gauge eld by adding gaugeinvariant quantities. therefore,

the precise form of the senseiberg limit depends on the chosen denition. it is then natural

to expect that dierent denitions will yield in the limit actions written in terms of dierent

star products. all these actions should be equivalent, since they can be resummed to yield the

same matrix theory action. moreover, any consistent star product will have to be associative

and will have to satisfy conditions (10) and (11).
