abstract

we study anti-de sitter black holes in 2+1 dimensions in terms of chern
simons gauge theory of the anti-de sitter group coupled to a source. taking the
source to be an anti-de sitter state specied by its casimir invariants, we show
how all the relevant features of the black hole are accounted for. enlarging the
gauge symmetry to super ads group, we obtain a supermultiplet of ads black
holes. we give explicit expressions for masses and the angular momenta of the
members of the multiplet.

1 introduction

the ads black hole in 2+1 dimensions is a solution of free einsteins equations with
a negative cosmological constant [1]. it is well known that the free einstein theory in
2+1 dimensions with or without a cosmological constant can be formulated as a free
chern simons theory [2, 3]. in a free chern simons theory, the eld strength vanishes
identically, so that there are no local degrees of freedom. it is then somewhat sur-
prising that a theory with no local degrees of freedom has a black hole solution which
must have non-trivial degrees of freedom to account for its entropy! presumably, m
theory, once it is fully constructed, will provide us with the correct answer. in the
meantime, one of the suggestions to resolve this issue is to modify the chern simons
action with a wzw term [4, 5]. another suggestion is to make use of the ads/cft
correspondence [6]. more recently, it has been suggested that the answer lies in the
coupling of the chern simons theory to a source [7]. in this approach, the free chern

simons theory is not only taken to be locally trivial. it is also taken to be globally
trivial in accord with machs principle. non-trivial topologies then arise as a result
of coupling to sources. this is one of the issues which we will address in this work.

one of the notable advantages of this approach is that it allows us to express the
asymptotic observables of the theory in terms of the properties of the sources. to
implement this idea, we must identify a localized source (particle) with an irreducible
representation of the gauge symmetry group [8]. for the present problem, this will
amount to relating the asymptotic observables of the btz black hole to the casimir
invariants of an ads state coupled to the chern simons action. we will show that
space-time will naturally emerge from such a gauge theory and will have all the
ingredients necessary for the ads black hole [1, 9]. these include, in particular, the
discrete subgroup underlying the identications.

a second issue which we will address in this work relates to the manner in which
black hole solutions t into supersymmetric schemes. a conventional method of
searching for signs of supersymmetry in black hole solutions is to look for killing
spinors. many works along these lines already exist in the literature. we cite a
representative few here [10]- [18], from which more references can be traced. one
way to see whether a given black hole solution admits killing spinors is identify
it with the bosonic part of an appropriate supergravity theory [10]- [18]. then,
by requiring that the fermions in the theory as well as their variations vanish, one
arrives at killing spinor equation(s). the asymptotic supersymmetries depend on
the number of non-trivial solutions of these equations consistent with the black hole
topology. for example, in asymptotically at space-times, a typical supermultiplet
consists of a black hole and a number of ordinary particles all with the same mass. in
contrast to the familiar situation in particle physics, where we have supermultiplets
consisting of particles only, in this approach there is no systematic way of looking for
supermultiplets consisting of black holes only. we will show that in 2 + 1 dimensions
it is possible to construct a theory which permits macroscopic solutions consisting of
all ads black hole supermultiplets [19]. it involves the chern simons gauge theory
of the (1,1) super ads group coupled to a super ads state (source). as we shall
see below, to be able to accommodate the structure of the solution which emerges
from such a theory it becomes necessary to broaden the standard notions of classical
geometries to include some quantum mechanical elements.

2 anti-de sitter space and algebra

the anti-de sitter space in 2+1 dimensions can be viewed as a subspace of a at
4-dimensional space with the line element

ds2 = dxadx a = dx 2

0  dx 2

1  dx 2

2 + dx 2
3

(1)

2

it is determined by the constraint

(x0)2  (x1)2  (x2)2 + (x3)2 = l2

(2)

where l is a real constant . the set of transformations which leave the line element
invariant form the anti-de sitter group so(2, 2). it is locally isomorphic to sl(2, r)
sl(2, r). from here on by anti-de sitter group we shall mean its universal covering
group.

with a = 0, 1, 2, we can write the ads algebra in two more convenient forms:

abcjc = abc(j +

c + j 
c )
la = (j +a  j a)

where

012 = 1;

ab = (1, 1, 1)

then, the commutation relations in, say, j 

a basis take the form [7]

the casimir operators in this basis have the form

hj 
a , j +

b i = ic

abj 
c ;

hj +
a , j 

b i = 0

j2
 = abj 

a j 

b

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

alternatively, we can use a combination of these with eigenvalues corresponding to
the parameters of the btz solution:

m = l2(aa + l2j aja) = 2(j2

+ + j2
)

j/l = 2laj a = 2(j2

+  j2
)

(7)

unless otherwise stated, we will use the same symbols for operators and their eigen-
values.

an irreducible representation of ads group can be labeled by the eigenvalues of
either the pair (m, j) or the pair (j+, j). for application to black holes, it is also
possible to label these representations by eigenvalues which are proportional to the
horizon radii r of the ads black hole [1, 7].

3 connection and the chern simons action

to write down the chern simons action, we begin by writing the connection in
sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) basis.

a = ab

 m ab = a

ja + ea

a = a+a

 j +

a + aa

 j 

a

(8)

where

eq. 9 should be viewed as denitions of e and  in terms of the two sl(2, r)
connections. the covariant derivative can be written as

aa

 = a

  l1ea



(9)

d =   ia =   ia+a

 j +

a  iaa

 j

then the components of the eld strength are given by

[d, d] = if +a

 j +

a  if a

 j 

a = if +

[a]

for a simple or a semi-simple group, the chern simons action has the form

ics =

3

a  a(cid:19)

where tr stands for trace and

a = adx  = a+ + a

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

we require the 2+1 dimensional manifold m to have the topology r  , with  a
two- manifold. so, the chern simons action with sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) gauge group
will take the form

ics =

(14)
here the quantities a are, in general, arbitrary coecients, reecting the semisimplic-
ity of the gauge group. up to an overall normalization, only their ratio is signicant.
as explained elsewhere [7], in the presence of a source (or of sources), any a priori
choice of the coecients a reduces the class of allowed holonomies, so that even
the classical theory coupled to sources will be aected by such a choice. for this
reason, we will keep the coecients a as free parameters in the sequel, so that we
can generate the correct holonomies for solutions both outside and inside the horizon.

4 so(2, 2) states and interaction with sources

following the approach which has been successful in coupling sources to poincare
chern simons theory [8], we take a source for the present problem to be an irre-
ducible representation of anti-de-sitter group characterized by casimir invariants m
and j (or r+ and r ). within the representation, the states are further specied
by the phase space variables of the source a and qa, a = 0, 1, 2, 3, subject to anti-
de sitter constraint given by eq. 2. to allow for the possibility of quantizing the
chern simons theory consistently, we must require that our sources be represented
by unitary representations of the ads group. the choice of relevant representations
from among these were discussed in reference [7]. here we note that since the ads
group in 2+1 dimensions can be represented in the sl(2, r)  sl(2, r) form, the
unitary representations of so(2, 2) can be constructed from those of sl(2, r). the
latter group has four series of unitary representations all of which are innite dimen-
sional. of these, the appropriate representations turn out to be the discrete series
bounded from below [7]. the states in an irreducible representation of sl(2, r) are
specied by the eigenvalues of its casimir operator and one of the generators.
in
reference [7], the compact generator was chosen to label the states. this corresponds
to inducing representations of sl(2, r) via its maximal compact subgroup so(2).
thus, suppressing the superscripts  which distinguish our two sl(2, r)s, we can
write

j2|f, m >= f (f  1)|f, m >

j0|f, m >= (f + m)|f, m >

in these expressions

f = real number  0; m = 0, 1, 2, ...

(20)

5

so, for this series, the eigenvalues of the casimir invariants of sl(2, r)  sl(2, r)
can be written as,

j2
 = f 2

  f

(21)

it follows that the innite set of states can, in a somewhat redundant notation, be
specied as

|j2

, f + m >; m = 0, 1, 2, ...

(22)

clearly, the integers m are not necessarily equal. using these states, we can construct
the discrete series of the unitary representations of so(2, 2). a typical state will have
the following labels:

|m, j >= |j2

+, j2

, f+ + m+, f + m >

(23)

to be able to identify the labels m and j with the corresponding labels in the ads
black hole, we must require that f  1 [7]. it would then follow that |j/l|  |m|,
as required for having a black hole solution.

the main advantage of diagonalizing a compact generator is that the maximal
compact subgroup so(2)  so(2) of so(2, 2) allows a parametrization of the ads
space in terms of circular functions so that the corresponding angular variable is pe-
riodic to begin with and will remain so in the black hole solution. as a result [7], the
periodicity necessary to obtain the discrete identication group need not be imposed
as an additional requirement as was done by btz [1]. however, to obtain the btz so-
lution from this starting point, it becomes necessary [1] to perform a wick rotation
in the space of casimir invariants to recover the hyperbolicity of the angular vari-
able. an alternative to this procedure is to construct the sl(2,r) representations by
diagonalizing a non-compact generator. in that case, the irreducible representations
of so(2, 2) can be constructed via induction from the subgroup so(1, 1)  so(1, 1).
one way to do this is to make the formal replacement j0  ij2 to go from the
formalism in which the compact generator j0 is diagonal to one in which the non-
compact generator j2 is diagonal . obviously, the structure and the classication of
the unitary representations will remain the same. the only dierence is that in the
latter case the angular variables to be used to parametrize the ads space are hyper-
bolic to begin with. then, as we shall see below, the 2 periodicity of the hyperbolic
angular variable will arise from the requirement of compatibility with the topological
properties of the chern simons theory coupled to a source.

with these preliminaries, we can couple a source to the ads chern simons theory

in the following way:

is = zc
+zc

d ha qa  (a+aj +
d h+(cid:16)j +aj +
a  l2j2

a + aaj 

a ) + (cid:16)qaqa  l2(cid:17)i

in this expression, c is a path in m,  is a parameter along c, and j 
a play the
role of c-number generalized angular momenta which transform in the same way as

+(cid:17) + (cid:16)j aj 

(cid:17)i
a  l2j2

(24)

the corresponding generators which label the source. the quantities  and  are
lagrange multipliers. the rst constraint in this action ensures that qa( ) satisfy the
ads constraint. as explained in previous occasions [7, 8, 20], it is not the manifold
m over which the gauge theory is dened but the space of qas which give rise to
the classical space-time. the last two constraints identify the source being coupled
to the chern simons theory as an anti-de sitter state with invariants j+ and j.
these constraints are crucial in relating the invariants of the source to the asymptotic
observables of the coupled theory via wilson loops.

the total action for the theory is given by:

i = ics + is

(25)

it is easy to check that in this theory the components of the eld strength still vanish
everywhere except at the location of the sources. so, the analog of eq. ? become

ijf  a

ij = 2aj  a2(~x, ~x0)

(26)

in particular, xing the gauge so that so(2, 2) symmetry reduces to so(1, 1) 
so(1, 1), we get

ijf  2

ij = 2af2(~x, ~x0)

(27)

where f are the invariant labels of the state as in eq. 23, but now they are associated
with the non-compact generator j2. all other components of the eld strength vanish.
we thus see that because of the constraints appearing in the action given by eq.
24, the strength of the sources become related to their casimir invariants. these
invariants, in turn, determine the asymptotic observables of the theory. since such
observables must be gauge invariant, they are expressible in terms of wilson loops,
and a wilson loop about our source can only depend on, e.g., j+ and j.

from the data on the manifold m given above, one can determine the properties
of the emerging space-time by solving eqs 27. the only non-vanishing components
of the gauge potential are given by [7]

a2

 = 2af

(28)

where  is an angular variable. although these are components of a connection which
is pure gauge, they give rise to non-trivial holonomies around the source. more
explicitly, we have

and

[a+] = exp(r+r+)j +

2

[a] = exp(rr+)j

since we are diagonalizing j 

2 operators, their matrix representation is given by

j 
2 () =

2   1

0 1) !

(29)

(30)

(31)

then, the above holonomies will take the form

[a+] =   exp(r+r+)

0

0

exp(r+r+) !

[a] =   exp(r+r)

0

0

exp(r+r) !

(32)

(33)

it was shown in reference [7] how these holonomies lead to a discrete identication
subgroup of so(2, 2), indicating that the manifold mq of the 0 + 1 dimensional elds
qa has all the relevant features of the macroscopic ads black hole solution. as we
shall see below, the same holonomies, suitably interpreted, will play a crucial role in
establishing the space-time structure of the supersymmetric theory discussed below.

5 the black hole space-time

to see how the space-time structure emerges from our anti-de sitter gauge theory,
we follow an approach which led to the emergence of space-time from poincare [8]
and super poincare [20] chern simons gauge theories. we have emphasized that the
manifold m is not to be identied with space-time. but the information encoded
in m and discussed in the previous section is sucient to x the properties of the
emerging space-time. to this end, let us consider a manifold mq satisfying the ads
constraint

q2
0  q2

1  q2

2 + q2

3 = l2 = 1

(34)

where  = cosmological constant. in fact, our sl(2, r)sl(2, r) formulation allows
us to take mq to be the universal covering space of the ads space. as we shall see,
the emerging space-time is the quotient of mq by the discrete subgroup  discussed in
the previous section. moreover, the source coupled to the chern simons action is an
ads state characterized by the casimir invariants (m, j) or, equivalently, (r+, r).
to parametrize mq consistent with the above constraint, consider a pair of 2-vectors,

~q = (q0, q1) = (f cosh, f sinh)

~qt = (q2, q3) = (cid:18)qf 2  l2cosh(t/l),qf 2  l2sinh(t/l)(cid:19)

where f = f (r), with r a radial coordinate which for an appropriate f (r) will become
the radial coordinate appearing in the line element for the btz black hole. as far
the constraint given by eq. 34 is concerned, the functional form of f (r) is irrelevant.
computing the line element in terms of the parameters (t/l, r, ), we get

(35)

(36)

ds2 = (

f 2
l2  1)dt2 

f  2dr2
( f 2
l2  1)

 f 2d2

(37)

8

where prime indicates dierentiation with respect to r.

anticipating the results to be given below, let us compare this line element with

that for the btz black hole [1]:

ds2 = [

r2
l2  m +

j 2
4r2 ]dt2 

dr2

l2  m + j 2
[ r2
4r2 ]

 r2[d 

j 2
2r2 dt]2

(38)

if we identify the labels m and j with the casimir invariants of an irreducible rep-
resentation of the ads group as discussed in the previous sections, we see that the
line element given by eq. 37 corresponds to an irreducible representation with j = 0
and m = 1. such a parametrization cannot provide us with an ads black hole with
a continuous range of values for j and m. what we need is a space-time mani-
fold mq in which the coordinates qa carry an arbitrary irreducible representation of
the ads group. we will construct this manifold explicitly by performing appropri-
ate gauge transformations on mq. although the original theory was invariant under
sl(2, r)sl(2, r) gauge transformations, we have already reduced this symmetry by
choosing to work in a gauge in which the left over symmetry is just so(1, 1)so(1, 1)
generated, respectively, by j 
2 . it turns out to be more convenient to work with gen-
erators

j2 = j +

2 + j 
2 ;

l2 = j +

2  j 
2

(39)

as was the case with the compact generators j0 and 0, the non-compact operators
j2 and 2 generate a so(1, 1)  so(1, 1) subgroup of the ads group. we identifying
the parameters  and t/l, respectively, with each so(1, 1) and proceed in the same
manner as we did for the compact generators in reference [7]. in particular, consider
the local gauge transformation [7, 8, 20, 21, 22]

~q(, t/l) = e(cid:16) r+
~qt(t/l, ) = e(cid:16) r

it then follows that

~q(, t/l)

~q( + 2, t/l) = e2
~qt(t/l,  + 2) = e2

l l2
~q( + 2, t/l + 2) = e2( r+
~qt(t/l + 2,  + 2) = e2( r

the factors by which these quantities change as   ( + 2) are reminiscent of the
holonomies which we obtained in section 4. there we found that these holonomies
in m led to a discrete identication group. to be consistent with this identication
group, we must require that the hyperbolic variable  be periodic. thus, the peri-
odicity of phi follows from the topology of m in the presence of a source. with this

9

provision, the vector (~q, ~qt) transforms in the same way as the one which in section
4 was parallel transported around a loop in the manifold m. calling the manifold
to which such vectors belong mq, we see that this manifold incorporates the same
dynamics as the phase space variables in m, and we are justied in using the same
letter q for both. thus, we can parametrize the manifold mq as follows [1, 7, 9]:

l

 

 

q0 = f cosh(cid:18)r+
q1 = f sinh(cid:18)r+
q2 = qf 2  l2cosh(cid:18)r
q3 = qf 2  l2sinh(cid:18)r

r+t

(42)

from these we can compute the line element. it is easy to show that it is the same
as that given by eq. 38 for r > r.

6 supersymmetric black holes

the theory which we will describe below is the supersymmetric generalization of the
theory which was discussed in the previous sections. we will see that the emerging
macroscopic theory consists of a supermultiplet of ordinary space-times and, as a
special case of this, a supermultiplet consisting of black holes only. the simplest way
of obtaining a supersymmetric extension of the anti-de sitter group is to begin with
the ads group in its sl(2, r)sl(2, r) basis. the n = 1 supersymmetric extension
of each sl(2, r) factor is the supergroup osp(1|2; r). thus, one arrives at the (1,1)
form of the n = 2 super ads group. its algebra is given by

[j 

a , j 

b ] = i c

ab j 
c ;

[j 
a , q
{q+

 , q

 ] = a 

 } = 0;

{q

 q
 , q
 ;
[j +, j ] = 0

 } = a

j 

a

the casimir invariants are given by

c = j2

 + q

 q



(43)

(44)

the spinor indices are raised and lowered by antisymmetric metric  dened by
12 = 12 = 1. the matrices (a)
, (a = 0, 1, 2), form a representation of sl(2, r)
and satisfy the cliord algebra

more explicitly, we can take them to be of the form:

{a, b} =

1
2

ab

0 =

1

0

2   1

0 1 ! ;

1 =

1

2   0 i

i 0 ! ;

2 =

10

1

2   0

1 0 !

1

(45)

(46)

it is important to note that the supersymmetry generators of osp(1|2, r) do not
commute with the casimir invariant of its sl(2, r) subgroup. that is,

[j2

, q] 6= 0

(47)

since super ads group is semi-simple, we can construct its irreducible repre-
sentations by rst constructing the irreducible representations of osp(1|2, r) [13].
depending on which osp(1|2, r) we are considering, the states within any such su-
permultiplet are the corresponding irreducible representations of sl(2, r) charac-
terized by the casimir invariants j+ or j, respectively. based on the rationale given
for the non- supersymmetric case [7], the irreducible representations of interest for
the present case are those which can be obtained from the unitary discrete series of
sl(2, r) and which are bounded from below. to construct the supermultiplet corre-
sponding to, say, the plus generators in eq. 22, we can take the cliord vacuum
state |+ > to be the sl(2, r) state with the lowest eigenvalue of j +
2 . in the notation
of eq. 22, this corresponds to an m = 0 state:

|f+, m >= |f+, m = 0 >= |f+ >

then, the superpartner of this state, again with m = 0, is the state |f+ + 1/2 >
obtained by the application of one of the qs. the corresponding values of j2
+ are
f+(f+ 1) and (f+ + 1/2)(f+ 1/2), respectively. the supermultiplet for the second
osp(1|2, r) can be constructed in a similar way.

we are now in a position to construct the (1,1) super ads supermultiplet as a
direct product of the two osp(1|2, r) doublets. altogether, there will be four states
in the supermultiplet. they will have the following labels:

|f+, f >;

|f+ + 1/2, f >;

|f+, f + 1/2 >;

|f+ + 1/2, f + 1/2 > (48)

from these, we can also obtain the expressions for the eigenvalues (m, j) of various
states within the supermultiplet:

|m1, j1 >= |m, j >
|m2, j2 >= |m + 2f+  1/2, j + 2f+  1/2 >
|m3, j3 >= |m + 2f  1/2, j  2f + 1/2 >
|m4, j4 >= |m + 2(f+ + f)  1, j + 2(f+  f) >

(49)

these states transform into one another under supersymmetry transformations.

the chern simons action for simple and semisimple supergroups has the same
structure as that for lie groups. the only dierence is that the trace operation is
replaced by super trace (str) operation. so, in the osp(1|2, r)  osp(1|2, r) basis
the chern simons action for the super ads group has the same form as that given
by eq. 14. but now the expression for connection is given by

a = ha a
 j 

i dx

a +

(50)

just as in the non-supersymmetric case, to have a non-trivial theory, we must couple
sources to the chern simons action. to do this in a gauge invariant and locally
supersymmetric fashion, we must take a source to be an irreducible representation
of the super ads group. as we saw above, such a supermultiplet consists of four
ads states. to couple it to the gauge elds, we must rst generalize the canonical
variables we used in the ads theory to their supersymmetric forms [13]:

qa  (qa, q)

then, the source coupling can be written as

is = zchadqa + dq + (a+ + a) + constraintsi

(51)

(52)

where again c is a path in m. the constraints here include those discussed for the
ads group and, in addition, those which relate the ads labels of the cliord vacuum
to the casimir eigenvalues of the super ads group. the combined action

i = ics + is

(53)

leads to the constraint equations

ijf  a

ij = 2aj  2(~x, ~x0);

ijf 

ij = 2aq2(~x, ~x0)

(54)

up to this point, everything proceeds in parallel with the non- supersymmetric
case. dierences begin to show up when one attempts to solve these equations by
choosing a gauge again so that the gauge symmetry is reduced to so(1, 1) so(1, 1):

ijf  2 = 2aj 

2 2(~x, ~x0)

(55)

although this equation is identical in form to eq. 27 for the non-supersymmetric
case, there is an essential dierence in the underlying physics. in the supersymmetric
case, the supermultiplet which we couple to the chern simons action consist of four
so(2, 2) states with dierent values of f. as a result, in the parallel transport
of qa around a close path analogous to the non-supersymmetric case, there will be
four sets of holonomies with dierent values of (j+, j) or, equivalently, (r+, r).
moreover, in the non-supersymmetric case, a single source with casimir invariants
(r+, r) or, equivalently, (m, j) will give rise to an ads black hole [7] for which the
line element is characterized with the corresponding values of m and j and has the
form given by eq. ?.
in the supersymmetric case, the source is a supermultiplet
in which there are four states of diering (m, j) values. then, depending on which
set (m, j) that we choose, we will get a dierent btz solution. since m and j are
not invariant under supersymmetry transformations, these solutions are transformed
into each other under supersymmetry. this makes it impossible for a single c-number
line element of the type given by eq. 38 to correspond to all the ads states of a
supermultiplet.

the situation here runs parallel to what was encountered in connection with super
poincare chern simons theory [20]. there it was pointed out that standard classical
geometries were not capable describing these structures and that one must make
use of nonclassical geometries. such geometries can be described in terms of three
elements:

1. an algebra such as a lie algebra or a lie superalgebra.
2. a line element operator with values in this algebra.
3. a hilbert space on which the algebra acts linearly.
for the problem at hand, the algebra of interest is the n = (1, 1) super ads
algebra in 2 + 1 dimensions. the corresponding hilbert space is the representation
space of the superalgebra given by eq. 48. then, instead of the btz line element
given, we begin with a line element operator with values in the n = (1, 1) superalgebra
and assume that its diagonal elements depend on the algebra only through the casimir
operators ( m, j) of its so(2, 2) subalgebra. the hats on top of m and j are meant
to distinguish the operators from the corresponding eigenvalues. thus, we have

ds2 = ds2( m , j)

the matrix element of this operator for each state of the supermultiplet will produce
a c-number line element:

< mk, jk|ds2( m, j)|mk, jk >= ds2(mk, jk)

(56)

in other words, for each state of the supermultiplet, the nonclassical geometry pro-
duces a layer of classical space-time. the number of the layers is equal to the dimen-
sion of the supermultiplet. supersymmetry transformations act as messengers linking
dierent layers of this multilayered space-time

an equivalent way of constructing the operator line element is to begin with the
parametrization of qa given by eq. 41. then, replacing the casimir eigenvalues
in those expressions with the corresponding casimir operators, we can proceed to
compute the line element operator. the result will look like the line element given
by eq. 38, except that now casimir eigenvalues are replaced with casimir operators.
this means that, for consistency, we must also interpret the quantities j 
in eq.
2
54 as operators. acting on dierent states of the supermultiplet, they will give the
corresponding f eigenvalues. there will therefore be not one set but four sets of
holonomies w [a+] and w [a]. each set will produce the discrete identication
subgroup in the corresponding layer of space-time.

consider, next, the conditions under which every layer of the supermultiplet cor-

responds to an ads black hole. for this to be true, we must have

this, in turn implies that

mk  0;

|jk|  lmk

f+  f  1

13

in the notation of eq. 48, for |j| = lm, two layers of the supermultiplet become
extreme ads black holes. the only exception is in the limiting case when m = j = 0,
in which case there will be three extremal black holes in the supermultiplet. it is also
interesting to note that for an appropriate choice of m and j or, equivalently, f+
and f, the same supersource which generates a black hole in one layer can generate
a naked singularity in another.
