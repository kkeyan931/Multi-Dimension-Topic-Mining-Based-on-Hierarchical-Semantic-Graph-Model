we compute the properties of a class of charged black holes in antide sitter spacetime, in
diverse dimensions. these black holes are solutions of consistent einsteinmaxwell truncations of
gauged supergravities, which are shown to arise from the inclusion of rotation in the transverse space.
we uncover rich thermodynamic phase structures for these systems, which display classic critical
phenomena, including structures isomorphic to the van der waalsmaxwell liquidgas system. in
that case, the phases are controlled by the universal cusp and swallowtail shapes familiar from
catastrophe theory. all of the thermodynamics is consistent with eld theory interpretations via
holography, where the dual eld theories can sometimes be found on the world volumes of coincident
rotating branes.

i. introduction

there is evidence that there is a correspondence [13] between gravitational physics in antide sitter spacetime
and particular types of conformal eld theory in one dimension fewer. this duality is a form of holography [5] and
a part of the correspondence operates by identifying the eld theory as living on the boundary of antide sitter (ads)
spacetime.

to be more precise, adsn+1mm is the spacetime of interest, and there is some (n+m+1)dimensional theory
of gravity compactied on it. the manifold mm can be an msphere, sm. the corresponding eld theory is an
ndimensional conformal eld theory living on a space with the topology of the boundary of adsn+1. the isometries
of the manifold mm appear as global symmetries of the eld theory: rsymmetries if the theory is supersymmetric.
this particular form of duality between gravity and eld theory is certainly intriguing. the large n limit (where n is
the rank of the su (n ) gauge group for the four dimensional yangmills eld theory, with appropriate generalizations
for other dimensions) of the eld theory at strong t hooft coupling corresponds to classical supergravity. as
pointed out in ref. [7], following the observations in ref. [3], the old program of semiclassical quantum gravity nds
a new lease on life in this setting, as computations such as those performed with gravitational instantons (at least in
ads) should have natural eld theory interpretations.

in this paper, we study the thermal properties of einsteinmaxwell ads charged black holes, and nd behaviour
consistent with eld theory interpretations. we do this for arbitrary dimensions (greater than 3 see section vii for
comments on d=3.) and determine the thermal phase structure of the corresponding eld theories. the cases of ads4,
ads5 and ads7 are particularly interesting of course, as they correspond to the theories found on the world volumes
of m2, d3, and m5branes, respectively. the d3brane case is d=4, n =4 supersymmetric su (n ) yangmills
theory, while the others are exotic superconformal eld theories [26]. we remark on the eld theory interpretation of
our new results in the light of holography.

this paper is also of relevance beyond mere considerations of holography. some of the black hole solutions and

1

their properties (thermodynamic or otherwise) are presented here for the rst time1. in particular, the lagrangian
action calculations and subsequent determination of the phase structure are presented in their entirety here.

in section ii, we present an ansatz for obtaining the einsteinmaxwell truncation of gauged ads supergravity with
appropriate compactications of d=11 supergravity on s7, and d=10 type iib supergravity on s5. in the planar
or innitevolume limit, the charged black holes in einsteinmaxwellantidesitter correspond to the near horizon
limits of rotating m2 and d3branes. in section iii, we display the solutions and note some of their properties.
the computation of the action of the solutions using a euclidean section is performed in section iv, and their
thermodynamic properties are uncovered in section v.

as the einsteinmaxwellantidesitter truncation is naturally associated to rotating branes, (at least in the case
of emads4 and emads5, see section ii) it is very natural to suppose that there is an associated dual eld theory,
arising on the world-volume of some branes. these would be the familiar conformal eld theories the d=4, n =4
yangmills theory (for coincident d3branes) and the conformal eld theory on the worldvolume of coincident m2
branes. the case of emads7 (i.e., without additional scalars) is not related to a rotatingbrane truncation of the
ads7s4 gauged supergravity (because s4 is even dimensional) and so we cannot declare that the dual eld theory
is the theory on the worldvolume of a rotating m5brane. however, we regard ads holography as a phenomenon
which exists independently of string and mtheory contexts [3,7]. hence, in other dimensions beyond d=4 and 5,
we expect that there is a dual theory. in particular, for emads7 the dual eld theory is probably a close cousin of
the m5brane theory.

the dual eld theories have their supersymmetry (if they had any to start with) broken due to coupling to a global
background u (1) current (as well as turning on a nonzero temperature). the cft is in a thermal ensemble for
which a certain u (1) charge density has also been turned on. in the ensemble, the expectation value of this charge
breaks the global so(m+1) rsymmetry of the cft. on the ads side, the electromagnetic charge carried by the
black holes is in the same u (1) of corresponding so(m+1) gauge group.

we nd very interesting phase structures at intermediate temperatures (in nite eld theory volume), as a result of
studying two complementary thermodynamic ensembles: we study thermodynamic ensembles with xed background
potential in which case the background is ads with a constant xed potential and we also study a xed localized
charge ensemble, for which the background is an extremal black hole with that charge.

in all cases, at suciently high temperature the physics is dominated by highly nonextreme black holes, and we
therefore recover the unconned behaviour characteristic of the associated eld theories [3,4]. the nite horizon
size of the black holes controls the behaviour of the expectation value of spatial wilson lines accordingly, yielding the
area law behaviour, as follows from ref. [4].

at intermediate temperatures, in the xed charge ensemble, the presence of charge allows a new branch of black
hole solutions to modify the qualitative phase structure in the low charge regime, resulting in a very interesting phase
structure about which we will have more to say later in this section.

intriguingly, as there is an extremal but nonsupersymmetric black hole with nonzero entropy even at zero
temperature, we must conclude something interesting about the eld theory in the presence of the global background
u (1) current: there must still be at t =0 a large number of states (with the given charge) available to the eld theory
in order to generate this entropy. for the case where we hold the potential (i.e., not the charge) xed, we do not
expect that this is the ground state, because the extremal black hole is can decay into kaluzaklein particles, leaving
ads. this is because the extremal black hole is not supersymmetric2.

this subtlety does not arise in the standard gibbonshawking calculus of the thermodynamics of black holes
which we use here because the calculations are not sensitive to the ability of the black holes to emit charged
particles3.

that the extremal black hole can decay by emitting charged kaluzaklein particles here follows from the fact that
the charge descends from rotation in higher dimensions. there are wellknown classical processes for reducing the

1the thermodynamics of reissnernordstromantidesitter black holes in four dimensions has been studied, with a slightly
dierent focus, in ref. [16].

2there do exist supersymmetric solutions here, but they all have naked singularities [18,19]. furthermore, due to a lack
of horizons, their euclidean section does not permit a denite temperature to be dened. these solutions are nevertheless
interesting. the fact that they do not play a role in the phase structure which we examine here does not mean that they may
not have a role in other ads physics and thus ultimately be relevant to the dual eld theory.
3for early work discussing the loss of charge by black holes, see ref. [8].

rotation of objects like black holes by scattering [9], and therefore in the context of quantum eld theory, one has
the analogous processes of emission in superradiant modes [10]. the same superradiant emission was considered in
the context of charged black holes in ref. [11,12]. thus one should expect the extremal black hole in the emads
truncation to decay via such supperradiant emission. of course, the usual thermal hawking radiation may also tend
to discharge nonextremal black holes [12,13]. in the xed potential ensemble, as the charge of the black hole is allowed
to uctuate while it is in contact with the thermal reservoir, superradiant and hawking emission processes can occur
to reduce the charge of the black hole, allowing it to decay back to ads (plus charge4). however, in the xed charge
thermodynamic ensemble (with varying potential), the extremal black hole is expected to be the longlived state at
zero temperature.

translating the formula for the entropy to the eld theory we nd, for example, that the four dimensional yang
mills theory (in the presence of the global background u (1) current) has a zerotemperature entropy which goes like
s q for large black holes, where q measures the charge in units of the minimal charge of kaluza-klein excitations
(i.e., 1/l). notice that the result for the four dimensional eld theory is consistent with connement at t =0, as
the result is independent of n . further, perhaps surprisingly, this residual ground state entropy is independent of
the spatial volume (i.e., it is not an extensive quantity). connement also follows from the fact that at t =0, the
euclidean section of the solution has no bolt, and therefore temporal wilson lines will always be homotopic to zero,
and therefore have zero expectation value. meanwhile, spatial wilson lines cannot interact with the horizon to produce
an arealaw dependence, because at extremality the horizon recedes innitely far away down a bertottirobinson
throat.

the phase structure which we obtain in each thermodynamic ensemble is summarized in gure 1.

the astute reader will recognize the gure on the right as the classic phase diagram of the liquidgas system! to
translate, our q is like the temperature t of the uid while 1/t is like the pressure p . the nonextreme black holes
of type (1) (small) and (3) (large) (see section iv and v for explanation) are like the liquid phase and the gaseous
phase, respectively. the critical line (vapour pressure curve) represents the place at which a rst order phase
transition between the liquid and gas occurs. as is well known, there is a critical temperature at which the vapour
pressure curve terminates, representing the fact that above a critical temperature, one can convert a liquid to a gas
continuously. this translates here into a critical charge above which the two types of black hole can be continuously
converted into one another with no discontinuity in their size.

that this system (rst modeled by van der waals [14], with a crucial modication by maxwell) appears in this

4note that the same thought experiments which do not allow the penrose process to produce a naked singularity [15] will
work here also, preventing us from connecting to the set of solutions representing naked singularities mentioned above, which
do not have the standard thermal treatment.

ads black hole thermodynamics is fascinating, and would not have been possible (at least in this way) without the
presence of the extra branches of solutions which appear when there is negative cosmological constant. we discuss
this further in sections v and iv. further fascination may be found in the fact that the explicit shape of the free
energy surface (as a function of q and t ) is that of the classic swallowtail catastrophe, familiar from the study of
bifurcations [34]. the control surface of the cusp catastrophe also appears, which (of course) follows from the well
known fact that it is the shape of the van der waals equation of state, viewed as a surface in p, v, t space.

that these shapes appear in this context suggests that there is some exciting universality to be explored here:
catastrophe theory is largely a classication of the possible distinct types of bifurcation shapes that can occur in a
wide variety of complex systems. this classication (which, for the common elementary cases is of ade type)
is equivalent to the (perhaps more familiar) classcation of singularities [35]. it is of considerable interest to discover
just what circumstances might give rise to the other members of the classication. recalling that this all translates
via holography into properties of a dual eld theory, we would learn a great deal about universal phase structures
which can occur there also.

ii. einsteinmaxwellads from spinning branes

physics near the horizon of supergravity branes can be described in terms of spontaneous compactication of
supergravity. in the case of nondilatonic branes which will be the focus of the paper when the compactication
takes place on a round msphere the low energy degrees of freedom are described by an eective theory of einstein
gravity with a negative cosmological constant coupled to so(m+1) gauge elds. the schwarzschildantidesitter
black hole solutions of this theory have been used in the context of the ads/cft correspondence to infer thermal
properties of the dual eld theories [3,4].

a natural extension of this program is to study ads black holes which are charged under a subgroup of the gauge
symmetry of the gauged supergravity. solutions of einsteinmaxwellantidesitter in some dimensions are known,
but in the context of string/mtheory, it is also interesting to determine how to make a truncation of the type iib
supergravity, or of 11 dimensional supergravity, which gives the emads eective action. in other words, we must
make certain higherdimensional choices which will result in the removal of the generic coupling of the f 2 term to
scalars resulting from the kaluzaklein reduction.

amusingly, one simple way to introduce (gauge) charge on the black holes is by simply spinning or twisting the
transverse (angular) sphere that becomes the compact space. decoupling of the scalars is accomplished by choosing
the spins in a maximally symmetric way. to be concrete, take ten dimensional iib supergravity, with the metric

the parameter l measures the size of the s5 and is given by the ux of the 5form eld across the s5. notice that
a component at in the time direction is interpreted as rotation of the s5 in its three independent rotation planes, in
equal amounts. components in the spatial direction would instead be twists. for the sake of brevity, and since in
this paper we will be mainly considering at components5, we will refer collectively to them as rotations.

(3)

this is precisely the einsteinmaxwellantidesitter (emads) eective action we seek, with a chernsimons term.
the latter is indeed required by supersymmetry in n =2 ve dimensional gauged supergravity [18], whose bosonic
sector is precisely described by the action above. note that the gauge coupling is proportional to g5/l.
the ads5s5 gauged supergravity theory in ve dimensions has an so(6) gauge symmetry, associated with
the group of isometries of s5. this is the rsymmetry group of the dual four dimensional n =4 superconformal
yangmills eld theory living on the d3branes from which this nearhorizon geometry arose. the above spinning
compactication corresponds to introducing rotation in the diagonal u (1) of the maximal abelian subgroup u (1)3.
correspondingly, there must be a dual eld theory to the emads truncation, which is simply the eld theory on the
worldvolume of the rotating brane. from the eld theory point of view, the rotation corresponds to considering states
or ensembles in which the dual global u (1) current (a subgroup of the so(6) rsymmetry group) has a nonvanishing
expectation value. studying emads gravity and its solutions will therefore be equivalent to studying properties of
the conformal eld theory in the presence of this background current6

a similar construction can be obtained by starting from eleven dimensional supergravity. the compactication in

this case is equivalent to focusing on the near horizon region of m2branes. in this case, take

where (4) is the volume form on the reduced fourdimensional space, and 4 denotes hodge duality on this space.
chernsimons terms are absent in four dimensions. appropriate inclusion of fermions leads to four dimensional
n =2 gauged supergravity. the more general u (1)4 theory with four independent gauge elds (i.e., four dierent
rotation parameters) 3 scalars and n =8 supersymmetry, as well as its black hole solutions, have been recently studied
in ref. [27].
we note here that there is no analogous construction for the ads7s4 gauged supergravity theory. this is be-
cause s4 is even dimensional and therefore we cannot have a symmetric split between u (1) rotations, as so(5) does
not have an even torus for its cartan subalgebra. this means that we cannot relate the physics of the black hole
solutions (which we write later) of the emads7 system to the physics of rotating m5branes of eleven dimensional
supergravity. nevertheless, as ads holography is a phenomenon which is expected to exist independently of string or
mtheory realizations, we expect that the physics does have a holographic interpretation in terms of a eld theory
closely related to that which resides on m5brane worldvolumes.

6a more general action can be constructed, that contains three dierent gauge groups, each associated with the three dierent
independent rotations of s 5, and two scalars that, roughly, measure the relative sizes of the distortions of the s 5 caused by
rotation. for simplicity, we will restrict ourselves to the case where all three rotations have the same magnitude, since it is
only in this case that the scalars decouple and we nd emads gravity. this framework provides the cleanest interpretation in
terms of the dual cft, since the number of spin parameters or charges precisely matches the number of eld theory operators
which are excited. see refs. [2123] for discussion of more general actions and solutions related to this.

iii. charged black holes in antide sitter spacetime

the black hole solutions of the above supergravity theories in d=4, 5 were originally studied in the past in refs. [18]
and [19]more recent investigations appear in refs. [21,27]. as we have seen in the previous section, such theories
can be regarded as compactications of the type iib and d=11 supergravities, where the gauge symmetry groups of
the gauged supergravities are broken by a specic choice of rotation planes in the transverse compact spheres. given
these considerations, it is natural to study the reissnernordstromantidesitter (rnads) black holes within the
context of the ads/cft correspondence.

even if the bosonic einsteinmaxwellantidesitter (emads) theories admit supersymmetric extensions only in
certain dimensions, it is easy and convenient to perform the analysis of their black hole solutions for arbitrary
dimension. for spacetime dimension n+1, the action can be written as7

(15)

which then xes at(r+)=0. the physical signicance of the quantity , which plays an important role later, is that
it is the electrostatic potential dierence between the horizon and innity.

if the inequality in eqn.(14) is saturated the horizon is degenerate and we get an extremal black hole. this inequality
imposes a bound on the black hole mass parameter of the form mme(q, l). in the cases where the theory admits
a supersymmetric embedding one could naively expect to approach a supersymmetric state as we saturate this mass
bound. however, the bound that results from the supersymmetry algebra is instead [18,19]: m2q, with the m=2q
solution being a bps state8. now, it is easy to see that the mass of the extremal black hole, me is, for nite l,
always strictly larger than 2q and therefore the extremal solution is non-supersymmetric. on the other hand, for the
supersymmetric solution one has

v (r) =(cid:16)1

(16)

which is strictly positive everywhere and therefore one nds a naked curvature singularity at r=0. in fact, all the
solutions violating the bound (14) are nakedly singular.

in the context of the ads/cft correspondence it is interesting to consider the limit where the boundary of adsn+1
is irn instead of irsn1 as was the case above. this can be regarded as an innite volume limit, with particular
relevance to the discussion of the dual eld theory. it should be noted that the existence of black hole solutions in
this limit is possible only due to the presence of a negative cosmological constant. in fact, black holes (and other
bolts) in ads spaces with varied topologies (even other than spherical and toroidal) have been extensively studied in
recent years [24], including in the mtheory [25]. here we will only focus on the planar (toroidal) solutions, which
we will obtain by scaling the nite volume solutions above, as done in [4]. to this eect, introduce a dimensionless
parameter  (which we will shortly take to innity) and set

notice that, compared with eqn. 19, the parameter m is zero in this limit.

the resulting solution can be seen to be supersymmetric as well (i.e., the killing spinors remain nite in the limit
, after appropriate rescaling), and nakedly singular. in this innite volume limit, the solutions asymptote to
ads space with the horospheric slicing.

these planar solutions can be constructed with the appropriate decoupling limit [1] of spinning d3 or m2branes,

as mentioned previously. we refer the reader to ref. [22] for the details.

8in d=4, where the black hole can have magnetic charge qm, there is a magnetic (or dyonic) bps solution as well [18] with
m=0, qm=  l/2.

iv. action calculation

the study of the euclidean section (ti ) of the solution, identifying the period, , of the imaginary time with
inverse temperature, will dene for us the grand canonical thermodynamic ensemble (for xed electric potential) or
the canonical ensemble (for xed electric charge). we interpret this in terms of immersing the system into a thermal
bath of quanta at temperature t =1/. for pure ads, the background consists of both charged and uncharged quanta
free to uctuate in the presence of xed potential . later, we consider the xed q ensemble. in that case we localize
all of the charge at a specic region and keep it xed. for such a background, as ads with a localized charge is not a
solution of the emads equations, we use the extremal black hole solution as the background, and retain only neutral
quanta in the thermal reservoir, in order to keep the charged xed. this makes sense, even though the extreme limit
has zero temperature, the euclidean section has no bolt and so can be assigned an arbitrary periodicity [28]. hence,
the metrics and gauge elds match in the asymptotic region.

with all of this in mind we now turn to the action calculations.

a. fixed potential

with our conventions the full euclidean action is given by analytically continuing eqn. (7), where, as usual when
the space is asymptotically ads the gibbonshawking boundary term gives a vanishing contribution. the boundary
terms from the gauge eld will vanish if we keep the potential at xed at innity. any possible chernsimons term
will not contribute when we restrict ourselves to purely electric solutions. imposing the equations of motion we can
eliminate the factors of r in order to obtain the onshell action

note that the temperature is zero when the black hole is extremal. this is because the horizon is degenerate there,
and  diverges, together with the fact that one can smoothly approach the extremal limit from nonzero temperature.
from the form of the equation for , it is apparent that there are qualitatively two distinct types of behaviour,
determined by whether  is less than or greater than the critical value 1/c. in particular, for 1/c,  diverges (t
+=l2(n 2)(c221), while for <1/c,  goes smoothly towards zero as r+0. it is instructive to plot
vanishes) at r2
the temperature as a function of horizon radius (size of black hole) for these two regimes (see g. 2).

values n=4, g=1, l=10 and  = 1, 0.7, 0 have been used here.) the divergence in the rst graph (here, shown with a vertical
line at re=4.08) is at zero temperature, where the black hole is extremal. this divergence goes away for <1/c, in general,
and the curve is similar to that of the uncharged situation with zero potential, shown last.

as can be seen from the gure, the regime of large potential (i.e.,   1/c) has a unique black hole radius associated
with each temperature. we will see later that this branch dominates the thermodynamics for all temperatures.
meanwhile the small potential regime has two branches of allowed black hole solutions, a branch with larger radii and
one with smaller. this is qualitatively similar to the familiar case of the uncharged schwarzschild black holes analyzed
in ref. [6], (or the structure of the taubbolts discovered in the thermodynamic studies of ref. [7,30]), which is the
=0 limit of the situation here. correspondingly, the smaller branch of holes is unstable, having negative specic
heat. they do not play any role in the physics9. (generally, the sign of the specic heat for a black hole of radius r+
can be inferred from the local slope of the (r+) curve. see also the discussion in section vi.)

b. fixed charge

if we wish to consider a situation where instead of the potential at innity, we x the charge of the black hole, then
the action (22) is not appropriate. upon variation of the gauge eld in the latter action, a boundary term results
that vanishes only if we keep at()= xed. that is, the onshell action of the previous subsection is i[, ]. if,
instead, we want to keep the charge xed, then we must add a boundary term to i [29],

i = i

4gz dnxhf na,

(25)

where n is a radial unit vector pointing outwards (notice that this boundary term is determined by the terms coming
from the variation of the oshell action (7), and not (21), which is ongravityshell. this distinction is only relevant
for n>3). then we get a thermodynamic function i[, q], in terms of the variables we wish to control.

to compute the action for the xed charge ensemble, using as background the extremal black hole, we evaluate
eqn. (21) for a black hole of mass m>me (and radius r+), and then subtract the contribution from the extremal
background. remembering to match the geometries of the background and black hole in the asymptotic region, a
straightforward calculation yields the nal result

9this may be contrasted with the situation in ref. [23]

the inverse temperature, , is given by eqn. (23). it is useful to plot the temperature as a function of horizon radius
(size of black hole) for future use. there are two basic scales in this expression for i, set by q and l, and so we
expect that there will be two distinct regimes which may display distinct phase structure: qqcrit and q<qcrit. for
comparison, we also show the case of q=0 (see g. 3).

the critical charge qcrit is the value of q at which the turning points of (r+) appear or disappear. with q=qcrit, the
periodicity =(r+, q, l) will have a point of inection with respect to r+ derivatives. hence we can simultaneously
satisfy

fig. 3. the inverse temperature vs. horizon radii, for q>qcrit, q<qcrit, and q=0, respectively. qcrit is the value of q at which
the turning points of (r+) appear or disappear. (the values n=4, l=5 and q = 25, 5, 0 have been used here.) the divergences
(here, shown by the vertical lines at re=0.98 and 4.05) are at zero temperature, where the black hole is extremal. the nal
graph, for the uncharged case, may be thought of as a limit of the previous graphs where the divergence disappears, showing
that small schwarzschild black holes have high temperature.

in this case, the gures show that for small charge (i.e., below qcrit), there can be three branches of black hole
solutions, to which we will refer later. the middle branch is unstable10 while the branch with the smallest radii is
new, and will play an interesting role in the thermodynamics. for zero charge, we return to the familiar two branch
situation of schwarzschild, while for large charge, we have a situation analogous to that seen for the large xed
potential.

10its slope and hence its specic heat is negative see the comments at the end previous subsection.

v. thermodynamics and phase structure

a. fixed potential

this is the grand canonical ensemble, at xed temperature and xed potential. the grand canonical (gibbs)
potential is w =i/=et sq. using the expression in eqn. (22), we may compute the state variables of the
system as follows:

together, they indeed satisfy the rst law: de = t ds + dq.

in order to study the phase structure and stability, we must observe the free energy w =i/ as a function of the

temperature. it is shown in gure 4.

fig. 4. on the left is a graph of the free energy vs. temperature for xed potential ensemble for large . (the values
n=4, g=1, l=10, =1 have been used here.) the center graph depicts a family of free energy curves for dierent values of
. note the crossover from the cusp (<1/c) to the single branch (>1/c) behaviour. on the right is the free energy curve
for the uncharged (or =0) ensemble, showing the physics familiar from the schwarzschild case: visible are the two branches
consisting of smaller (unstable) and large (stable) black holes. the entire unstable branch has positive free energy while the
stable branchs free energy goes (rapidly, on this scale) negative for all t >tc.

the interpretation of this is as follows. at any nonzero temperature, for large potential (>1/c) the charged black
hole is thermodynamically preferred, as its free energy (relative to the background of ads with a xed potential) is
strictly negative for all temperatures.

this behaviour diers sharply from the small potential (<1/c) situation, which is qualitatively the same as the
uncharged case: in that situation, in nite volume, the free energy is positive for some range 0<t <tc, and it is only
above tc that the thermodynamics is dominated by schwarzschild black holes (the larger, stable branch), after their
free energy is negative. (see the center graphs in gure 4.)

so for high enough temperature in all cases the physics is dominated by nonextremal black holes. in this case, (after

11

converting gravitational to eld theory quantities11) the free energy and entropy behave at ultrahigh temperature as

f vn1t nn p(n)
s vn1t n1n p(n),

(30)

where vn1 is the (n1)dimensional spatial volume upon which the eld theory lives. this is the unconned
behaviour appropriate to the dual ndimensional eld theory. the function p(n) is 2 when n=4; 3/2 when n=3; 2/3
when n=6. the resulting power of n shows how the number of unconned degrees of freedom of the theory goes with
n , by analogy with the case of n=4 where n 2 counts the dependence on the number of degrees of freedom on n for
an su (n ) gauge theory.

at low temperatures, and for >1/c, we have something very new. notice that as we go to t =0, the free energy curve
approaches a maximum value which is less than zero. this implies that even at zero temperature the thermodynamic
ensemble is dominated by a black hole. from the temperature curve (2) it is clear that it is the extremal black hole,
with radius r+=re. for =1/c, at t =0 we recover ads space.

so this suggests that even at zero temperature the system prefers to be in a state with nonzero entropy (given
by the area of the black hole). notice that this t =0 situation displays the conned behaviour characteristic of the
ordinary conformally invariant zerotemperature phase, despite the presence of the black hole. this follows from the
fact that the temporal wilson lines will still have zero expectation value, as the fundamental strings which dene them
cannot wind the horizon which has innite period at zero temperature. similarly, spatial wilson lines will display
the area law behaviour, because the fundamental string worldsheets cannot be obstructed by the horizon, because
at extremality, it is innitely far away down a throat.

having pointed out this intriguing possible zero temperature behaviour, we expect that for the case of xed potential
considered here, this is not the complete story. we must allow for the possibility that the extremal black hole might
decay due to processes involving kaluzaklein particles charged under the u (1). (see the discussion near the end of
section i.) this possibility cannot be discounted because the extremal black hole is not supersymmetric, as pointed
out before, and therefore not guaranteed to be stable by the supersymmetry algebra. we expect that calculations
which include the eects of charge emission will shift the free energy back to zero, representing the true, equilibrium
situation. alternatively if we consider the action (7) on its own merit outside of string or mtheory compactications,
it may be regarded as part of a theory without fundamental charged particles.

the resulting thermodynamic phase structure for the xed potential ensemble is summarized in the left diagram of

gure 1.

b. fixed charge

we have seen that we may consider a t =0 background containing an extremal black hole of charge q. let us now

keep this charge xed and allow the potential at innity to vary.

this is the canonical ensemble, and the corresponding thermodynamic potential, the free energy, is i/=f =et s.

the energy, entropy and electric potential are computed as

in this case e measures the energy above the ground state, which is the extremal black hole. together, they satisfy
the rst law.

the free energy as a function of temperature is shown below for the cases of small and large charge, respectively

(compare to the third graph in gure (4) for the uncharged case).

11we do this using the standard formulae derived from the brane geometry [1,3,4]: for n=3, gl7 and ln 1/6; for n=4,
gl5 and ln 1/4; for n=6, gl4 and ln 1/3.

the other end of branch 2, and continues towards the bottom right. the graphs on the right shows how the branches arise from

that there are three branches for the small charge case follows from the second graph in gure 3, which is magnied
and labeled in g. 5, on the right. from there, it is clear that for low temperature there can only be one solution
(branch 1) for the black hole radius. at some temperature t1=1/1, the origin of two new branches (branches 2
and 3) of solutions appears (t1=0.089, 1=11.15 for the chosen parameters in the plot.). above this temperature
(below 1), there are therefore three distinct branches of solution until at temperature t2=1/2, (t2=0.105, 2=9.55
in the plot) two of the branches (1 and 2) coalesce and disappear, leaving again only a single branch (3), which persists
for all higher temperatures.

returning to the free energy plot, the meaning is now clear. starting to the extreme left of the plot, (low temper-
ature) we see that there is a single branch of free energy, corresponding to the branch 1 solutions. at t1, branches 2
and 3 appear on the graph and separate from each other at higher temperatures. at t2, branches 1 and 2 coalesce
and disappear, while branch 3 persists for all higher temperatures, continuing to the left.

so from zero temperature the negative free energy of branch 1 means that those nonextreme black holes dominate
the thermodynamic ensemble. at temperature tc, (tc=0.092 in the plot) the free energy of branch 3 is actually more
negative than that of branch 1, and so that branch of nonextremal black holes takes over the physics and continue
to do so for all higher temperatures.

the situation at tc is a genuine nite temperature phase transition, of rst order. (notice from the rst graph in
gure 5 that the free energy is continuous, but its rst derivative is discontinuous.) this results from the jump (along
the dotted line in the nal graph in gure 5) from branch 1 to branch 2, from small to large r+ black holes, as the
temperature increases. as the entropy is proportional to rn1
+ , there is a jump in the entropy, or a release of latent
heat.

as we approach the critical value, qcrit, of the charge representing the crossover into the large charge regime, the
kink in the free energy and therefore the transition vanishes, as branches 1 and 3 merge (and branch 2 disappears).
the dierence in horizon radii between the two branches, +=r(3)
+ r(1)
+ , may be thought of as an order parameter for
the transition, as it vanishes above qcrit, where the transition goes away.

as noted before in the case of xed potential ensemble, branches 2 and 3 are the exact analogues of the small
and large schwarzschild black holes of hawking and page [6], or the small and large taubbolts discovered in the
thermodynamic studies of ref. [7,30]. in those papers, above a certain temperature t1, there were two allowed solutions
at a given temperature, the smaller (branch 2) being unstable and the larger (branch 3) being stable, which persists
to dominate the thermodynamics above some critical temperature tc. the existence of a stable branch 1, and its
merger with branch 2 to disappear at t2 is a new feature when we add a small xed charge to the story. conversely,
if we start from a situation where charge is present on the black hole but the cosmological constant vanishes, then we

13

nd branches 1 and 2, and it is only when the negative cosmological constant is turned on that branch 3 appears.

for large charge, there is only a single branch allowed, (see gure 5, the cusps collide and disappear) and the
associated thermodynamic story is correspondingly simpler. the free energy shows that the nonextreme charged
black holes dominate from t =0.

in all cases (large or small q), the ultra high temperature phases are dominated by a black hole and the free energy

and entropy have the characteristic unconned eld theory behaviour shown in eqns. (30).

one might examine the approach to the critical point more closely. in particular, consider the behaviour of the

specic heat

cq 

m
t

=

m/r+
t /r+

.

(32)

with q=qcrit, as the temperature approaches the critical value, one nds a singularity with cq(ttc)2/3. this
behavior may be contrasted with the (ttc)1/2 singularity found in ref. [23]. the essential dierence is of course
that near the critical point we have a point of inection with ttc  (r+rcrit)3, while ref. [23] considers a minimum
with ttc  (r+rcrit)2.
the evolution of the free energy of the system as a function of charge is particularly interesting as one goes from
zero charge to large charge. the single cusp of the uncharged (schwarzschild) system is joined by a second cusp which
comes in from innity, forming (with the original one) a section of the well known swallowtail shape, familiar as a
bifurcation set or catastrophe in singularity or catastrophe theory. the signicance of this is discussed in the next
section. as we cross over into the large charge regime at some critical value of q, the cusps merge and the free energy
becomes a simple monotonic function. for completeness, we include a series of plots showing this evolution. (we do
not put them on the same axes, as we did for the xed potential case, for the sake of clarity.)

this complete evolution describes the two dimensionalswallowtail catastrophe.

the resulting thermodynamic phase structure for the xed charge ensemble is summarized in the diagram on the

right in gure 1.

vi. catastrophic holography?

we cannot refrain from further general comments upon the meaning and structure of the curves that we have
uncovered in the previous sections. although we plotted only the cases for the n=4 case, representing ads5 (and
hence four dimensional eld theory), the same universal structures appear in the cases n=3 and 6 as well, giving the
same pleasing phase structure for the xed charge ensemble.

the phase structure that we uncovered for the xed charge ensemble should remind the reader of the classic van
der waalsmaxwell behaviour, modeling the liquidgas system. indeed, they are isomorphic. the (r+) curve (the
middle graph of gure 3) should recall the graph of the p (v ) van der waals equation of state, where p (the pressure)
is replaced here by  and v (volume) by r+.

the instability of branch 2 is then simply the familiar instability of the corresponding section of the vander waals
curve. the jump from branch 1 to branch 3 which we deduced from the form of the free energy is the precise analogue
of the maxwell construction12 in the isomorphism between our parameters and those of the van der waalsmaxwell
system, our charge q is equivalent to their temperature t .

the instability of branch 2 in both languages makes intuitive sense: as one increases the pressure, the volume
should decrease, and therefore the positively sloped branch is not stable. a similar statement holds for the black holes
after making the translation to the current situation: for black holes in equilibrium with the heat bath, an increase
in the temperature results in an increase in the black hole radius and hence mass, for stable black holes. notice that
this also follows from the rst law, recalling that the entropy is a positive power of the radius. so the positive slope
branch of the (r+) curve is generally unstable.

in the language of catastrophe theory [34] the study of jumps in some state variables as a result of smooth
changes in control variables the physical solutions of the (r+, q) curve, viewed as a two dimensional surface in
(, q, r+) space, is the control surface of the cusp catastrophe. the cusp shape is the union of points in the (, r+)
plane (the control variables) where the state variable (the allowed value of r+) jumps from branch 1 to branch 3,

12although we do not seem to have the precise equal area law here, we have used the lowest free energy condition from
which it follows in the case of the liquidgas system.

15

as branch 2 is unstable. after applying the minimum free energy condition to determine the allowed branches (the
maxwell criterion), the cusp catastrophe appears in the (q, ) plane, (or equivalently the (q, t ) plane) collapsed to
the critical line (see gure 1) (or vapour pressure curve) along which the two types of black hole can coexist, and
across which there is a phase transition. the end of the line, at the critical value qcrit, where branch 2 disappears, is
the point where the distinction between branch 1 and 3 goes away. the order parameter, + for this critical point is
the radius dierence of the branches +r(3)
+ . beyond the critical charge there is no phase transition (+=0) in
going from branch 1 black holes to branch 3 by increasing the temperature. this is of course the familiar statement
that above a critical temperature, there is no phase transition in going from a gas to a liquid by increase of pressure.
intriguing is the fact that the two dimensional free energy surface f (, q) forms the shape of the swallowtail
catastrophe (see gure 6). (note that for n=3, 4 and 6 the shape is the same.) this naturally follows from the ability
of the (r+) curve to produce three branches, and the resulting shape for the free energy curve is the union of three
branches.

+ r(1)

here, the swallowtail does not have the usual interpretation as a bifurcation surface (like the cusp does above) but
it is natural to wonder whether its appearance tells us that there is some universality at work here. this is because
the language of catastrophe theory is largely a classication of the possible distinct types of bifurcation shapes that
can occur. this classication (which, for the common elementary cases is of ade type) is equivalent to the
(perhaps more familiar) classcation of singularities [35]. a natural question is whether or not the inclusion of more
control parameters will always result in a free energy curve of a shape (and corresponding phase structure) which falls
into the classication. i would certainly be amusing to nd yet another case of the ade classication appearing in
string and mtheory physics.

vii. concluding remarks

the study of the thermodynamics of black holes in einsteinmaxwellantidesitter is highly relevant to the ther-
modynamics of certain superconformal eld theories with a background global current switched on. this follows from
the logic of the ads/cft correspondence, and the fact that the emads system can arise as the nearhorizon physics
of rotating m2 and d3branes, and it should therefore be regarded as the eective theory of the strongly coupled
eld theory living on the rotating branes worldvolume13.

the phase structures of the charged black hole systems studied here, and summarized in gure 1, are markedly
dierent from those of the uncharged systems studied before in this context [3,4,6,7]. the addition of charge revealed
a rich phase structure, with precise analogues to classic thermodynamic systems. the physics is consistent with a
dual eld theory interpretation.

in all cases, the innite volume limit can be found by taking the limits given in eqn. 17. this scaling may be applied
to the expressions for the actions (eqns.(22) and (26)) and the period (eqns.(23) and (24)). in all cases, the result
is that there is only one branch of black hole solutions (like the large charge and potential situations had in nite
volume), and the free energy is negative denite, showing that the thermodynamics is dominated by black holes for
all temperatures. of course, this is what we should expect, from the eld theory point of view.

as we commented before, the gauge elds in the ads space naturally couples to a cft current j, following the
prescription of ref. [3]. from the asymptotic variation of the gauge eld (12) or its corresponding eld strength, one
then has an expectation value hjtiq. thus one might think of the cft state as containing a plasma of (globally)
charged quanta. the precise nature of the cft state depends on the ensemble, which we were studying. for the
case of the xed potential, the dual statement is that a chemical potential conjugate to the global charge has been
introduced leading to the expectation value. the xed charge calculations correspond to an ensemble of cft states
with a xed global charge. thus the dierence between the two calculations is analogous to that between the canonical
(xed t ) and microcanonical (xed e) ensembles.

in the context of d3 branes with n=4, the so(6) gauge elds couple to the rsymmetry currents in the super
yangmills theory. this aspect of the duality has been used to great advantage to produce nontrivial consistency
tests by comparing correlators protected by supersymmetry [33]. of course in the present case, with the truncation
to emads theory, we are focussed on a particular diagonal u (1) generator of the so(6) symmetry.

13strictly speaking, in performing a nearhorizon limit explicitly on a brane solution, one gets the innite volume limit black
hole solutions of emads, but the interpretation of the nite volume solutions clearly follows.

16

in this context, we can translate the results of the supergravity calculations to quantitative statements about the
strong coupling behavior of the superyangmills theory. up to numerical factors, we have as usual [1]: g2
y mg and
(l/ls)4gn , (where g is the type iib string coupling) as well as g5g2l8
s/l5. it remains x how the black hole charge
should be characterized in the cft. the most natural approach is to measure the physical charge (11) in terms of
the fundamental charge of the kaluzaklein excitations in the ads space, i.e., with q= q/l. in the eld theory,
q then essentially counts the number of fundamentally charged quanta in a given state. given this framework, we
can consider the eld theory content of our results. for example, one might wonder what the critical charge (28)
appearing in the xed charge phase diagram corresponds to:

qcrit 

l qcrit
g  n 2.

(33)

in general, translating the entropy, mass or free energy to a eld theory expression produces a complicated function
of both the temperature t and the charge q. one relatively simple case is the high temperature limit, where the
charge essentially plays no role (see eqn. (30)). another interesting case to consider is that of the extremal black holes
for which t =0. by demanding that v (r+)=0 and (v /r)(r+)=0 have a consistent solution, one nds that the mass
and charge parameters are related by the following expression:

where z=3m/l2 and y2=27q2/l4. a simple case to consider is that of a large black hole with m>>l2, for which
z3y4/4. further in this limit, one has that mr2

+ and so

pz2  y2 = (1 + z)  1 + z

(34)

r3
+
g 

l q
g  q .

s 

(35)

notice that implicitly here we are considering a regime where q >> n .
it would certainly be interesting if this
entropy result could be recovered by considering partitioning the charge q amongst the charged excitations of the
cft.

we have left aside the case of compactication of six dimensional supergravity on s3 to get ads3. by setting the s3
in rotation in its two independent rotation planes, in a symmetric fashion, we get an electric potential in ads3. doing
so, notice that if we start from the solution describing a rotating six dimensional black string (such as the one obtained
from the d1d5 bound state), then, in the throat limit the rotation of the s3 can be undone by a dieomorphism. in
other words, the eective gauge eld in three dimensions is pure gauge [31]. nevertheless, as shown in ref. [32], there
do exist charged black hole solutions in emads theory in three dimensions. these have an electric potential that
diverges logarithmically at innity, which prevents one from dening the ensemble at xed potential. nevertheless, if
the extremal black hole background is subtracted, then the xed charge ensemble can be appropriately dened. for
nonrotating black holes (in ref. [32] the full kerrnewman solution is constructed) there is only one branch, just like
we have found for large xed charge (see gure 3, left), with corresponding simple thermodynamic structure given by
