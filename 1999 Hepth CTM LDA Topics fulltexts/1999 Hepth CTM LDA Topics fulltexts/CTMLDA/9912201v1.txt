abstract

an irreducible hamiltonian brst approach to topologically cou-
pled p- and (p + 1)-forms is developed. the irreducible setting is en-
forced by means of constructing an irreducible hamiltonian rst-class
model that is equivalent from the brst point of view to the original
redundant theory. the irreducible path integral can be brought to a
manifestly lorentz covariant form.

1 introduction

the typical feature of p-form gauge theories, namely, the reducibility al-
lows their link with string theory and supergravity models [1][6]. recently,
p-form gauge theories have attracted attention in relation with their charac-
teristic cohomology [7] and also with their applications in higher dimensional
bosonisation [8]. from the point of view of the brst quantization, theories
involving p-forms implies the introduction of ghost elds with ghost number
greater that one (ghosts of ghosts, etc.), and, in the meantime, of a pyramid

of non-minimal variables [9][17]. interacting p-forms were analyzed within
the reducible hamiltonian brst framework in [18], being obtained the ghost
and auxiliary eld structures necessary at the antield brst quantization.
the main result of this paper consists in proving that it is possible to
quantize p-form gauge theories with topological coupling along an irreducible
hamiltonian brst procedure. our method basically relies on replacing the
original redundant rst-class model with an irreducible one, and on further
quantizing the resulting irreducible rst-class system accordingly the stan-
dard hamiltonian brst lines. the derivation of the irreducible rst-class
theory relies on requiring that all the antighost number one co-cycles from
the koszul-tate homology identically vanish under a convenient redenition
of the antighost number one antighosts while the number of physical degrees
of freedom is kept unchanged with respect to the initial model. as a con-
sequence of our analysis, the two theories are found physically equivalent,
which further allows (from the brst point of view) the substitution of the
hamiltonian brst quantization of the reducible model with that of the ir-
reducible system. initially we approach topologically coupled abelian p- and
(p + 1)-forms described by a quadratic action [19] and then discuss the more
general case of interacting abelian forms with topological coupling, inferring
an irreducible lagrangian formulation implied by our hamiltonian approach
that can be conveniently applied to the interacting case. although the idea
of transforming a set of reducible rst-class constraints into an irreducible
one is addressed in [13], [20], it has not been either developed or applied until
now to the irreducible quantization of this type of models.

the paper is organized in four sections.

in section 2 we focus on the
construction of an irreducible hamiltonian rst-class theory starting with
topologically coupled abelian p- and (p + 1)-form gauge elds described by
a quadratic action within the homological context of the koszul-tate dier-
ential, and provide the associated irreducible hamiltonian brst symmetry.
we then nd by means of standard brst hamiltonian arguments that it
is permissible to replace the redundant hamiltonian brst symmetry with
the irreducible one, and infer the irreducible path integral with the help
of a suitable gauge-xing fermion. section 3 is devoted to the extension
of our irreducible procedure to the interacting case. there, we work with
a model of irreducible hamiltonian rst-class system and nd that the re-
sulting lagrangian gauge theory displays some manifestly lorentz covariant
irreducible gauge transformations. the lagrangian setting is adequate for

2

an irreducible approach to higher-order interacting gauge theories with topo-
logical coupling. in section 4 we expose the nal conclusions.

2 irreducible hamiltonian brst analysis

in this section we construct the path integral for topologically coupled abelian
p- and (p + 1)-form gauge elds in the context of an irreducible hamiltonian
brst procedure. in view of this, we perform the canonical analysis of the
starting quadratic lagrangian action and observe that this model is subject
to some abelian rst-class constraints that are p-stage reducible. the rst-
step of our irreducible approach consists in the construction of an irreducible
rst-class set of constraints corresponding to the initial redundant ones based
on homological aspects. this purpose is attained by means of making the
original antighost number one co-cycles from the reducible koszul-tate com-
plex to vanish identically under a proper redenition of the antighost number
one antighosts, and, in the meantime, by maintaining the initial number of
physical degrees of freedom unchanged with respect to the irreducible back-
ground. the implementation of these conditions yields an abelian irreducible
rst-class constraint set, an associated rst-class hamiltonian and, moreover,
provides an irreducible koszul-tate complex corresponding to the original re-
ducible one. the construction is realized in a gradual manner starting with
the cases p = 1 and p = 2, and is further generalized to arbitrary values of
p. next, we show that the irreducible brst symmetry exists as it satises
the general grounds of homological perturbation theory. in the sequel we in-
vestigate the correlation between the reducible and irreducible hamiltonian
brst symmetries and prove that the physical observables underlying the
reducible and irreducible theories coincide, which enables the substitution of
the hamiltonian brst quantization of the original model with the brst
quantization of the irreducible system. finally, we realize the hamiltonian
brst quantization of the irreducible model by using an appropriate gauge-
xing fermion and non-minimal sector, inferring the irreducible path integral,
which is local and manifestly lorentz covariant.

metry with respect to the indices between brackets. in the sequel we work
with the conventions f i1...im = f if m = 0, and f i1...im = 0 if m < 0.

2.2 construction of irreducible constraints

initially, we obtain an irreducible model corresponding to topologically cou-
pled abelian p- and (p + 1)-form gauge elds by means of homological argu-
ments and by requesting the preservation of the number of physical degrees
of freedom with respect to the redundant model. in this context, we derive
an irreducible rst-class set associated with the reducible constraints (45).
in order to clarify the main aspects linked to our irreducible treatment, we
gradually investigate the cases p = 1 and p = 2, and then generalize the
construction to an arbitrary p.

2.2.1 the case p = 1

the constraints (45) take in this situation the concrete form

g(2)  j j +

m
6

0jklf jkl  0,

(12)

5

and are rst-stage reducible, the reducibility relations being expressed by

g(2)

i  2jji  0,

(13)

z i g(2)

i  i g(2)

i = 0.

(14)

the reducible hamiltonian brst symmetry sr = r + dr +    involves two
crucial graded dierentials. one of them (r) is called the koszul-tate dier-
ential and realizes an homological resolution of smooth functions dened on
the rst-class constraint surface. its graduation is governed by the antighost
number (antigh), and we have that antigh (r) = 1. the main property
of r is the acyclicity at non-vanishing antighost numbers. the other one
(dr) is known as a model of exterior derivative along the gauge orbits and
accounts for the gauge invariances implied by the presence of the rst-class
constraints. the degree of dr is named pure ghost number (pure gh), and
is dened like pure gh (dr) = 1. in the case p = 1 the reducible koszul-tate
complex includes the antighost number one fermionic antighosts p2 and p2i,
being dened through the relations

rza = 0,

rp2 =  g(2),
rp2i =  g(2)

,

i

(15)

(16)

(17)

where za is any of the elds a, h  or their momenta. with the help of
the denitions (17) and the reducibility relations (14), it follows that there
appear a non trivial co-cycle in the homology of r, of the type

 = ip2i.

(18)

in order to restore the r-exactness of this co-cycle and thus the acyclicity of
the koszul-tate dierential it is necessary to enhance the antighost spectrum
with the antighost number two bosonic antighost  and to set

r

 = ip2i.

(19)

the idea of transforming this reducible model into an irreducible one is based
on redening the antighost number one antighosts p2i involved with the co-
cycle (18) like

p2i  p 

2i = dj

ip2j,

(20)

6

such that the new co-cycle of the type (18), namely,

 = ip 
2i

(21)

vanishes identically. as a consequence, the new co-cycle  is trivial without
adding the antighost number two antighost , hence the resulting model is
irreducible. in view of this we choose the matrix dj
i to satisfy the properties

idj

i = 0,

dj

i

g(2)

j = g(2)

i

.

taking into account (17), (20) and (23), we have that

p 

2i =  g(2)

i

,

while the properties (22) yield that  is indeed vanishing

  0.

(22)

(23)

(24)

(25)

in (24) we used the notation  instead of r in order to emphasize the ir-
reducibility of the new approach. thus, if the equations (2223) possess
solutions, then the co-cycle  vanishes identically and the theory becomes
irreducible, the presence of the antighost  being useless. the solution to
the equations (2223) exists and is given by

dj

i = j

i 

ji


,

where  = kk. replacing (26) in (24) we arrive at

p2i 

i


(cid:16)j p2j(cid:17) =  g(2)

i

.

(26)

(27)

the relations (27) describe the action of the koszul-tate dierential un-
derlying an irreducible model. at this point we explore the request on the
equality between the numbers of physical degrees of freedom associated with
the reducible and irreducible theories. the original reducible theory has
three physical degrees of freedom, while the irreducible theory possesses two
physical degrees of freedom as the set (13) will be replaced by a correspond-
ing set of three independent rst-class constraints. this is why we need to

7

supplement the original eld/momentum spectrum of the irreducible theory
with an extra canonical bosonic pair, to be denoted by (h, ). with these
supplementary variables at hand, the number of physical degrees of freedom
associated with the irreducible model is now equal to three. we demand that
 is the non vanishing solution to the equation

(cid:16)ip2i(cid:17) = .

(28)

the last condition together with the invertibility of  guarantee the irre-
ducibility of the new theory because the last equation possesses non-vanishing
solutions if and only if  (ip2i) 6= 0, hence if and only if (18) is not a co-cycle.
inserting (28) in (27) we infer that

p2i =  g(2)

i + i  (2)

i

,

(29)

which signify the denitions of  on the antighost number one antighosts
associated with an irreducible model possessing the irreducible constraints

(2)
i  g(2)

i  i  0,

(30)

instead of the reducible constraints (13) of the original theory. in conclu-
sion, we constructed an irreducible rst-class constraint set corresponding to
topologically coupled abelian one- and two-form gauge elds, of the type

(1)  0  0, (1)

i  0i  0,

(2)  jj +

m
6

0jklf jkl  0, (2)

i  2jji  i  0.

the constraints (45) are given in this case by

g(2)

i  2j ji

0ijklmf jklm  0,

g(2)

ij  3kkij  0,

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

and are second-stage reducible, the rst-stage reducibility relations being
given by

i g(2)

i = 0, 2i g(2)

ij = 0.

(35)

8

by introducing the fermionic antighosts p2i and p2ij of antighost number
one, the koszul-tate operator acts like

rp2i =  g(2)

i

,

rp2ij =  g(2)
ij ,

(36)

(37)

while its action on the original elds/momenta is vanishing. the reducibility
relations (35) yield the antighost number one non trivial co-cycles

  ip2i,

j  2ip2ij.

(38)

(39)

in order to restore the acyclicity of r we add the bosonic antighost number
two antighosts  and i, and put

r = ip2i,

r

j = 2ip2ij.

(40)

(41)

because of the second-stage reducibility relation, there appear a supplemen-
tary non trivial co-cycle at antighost number two

  ii,

(42)

which is killed by means of introducing the fermionic antighost number
three antighost  through

r = ii.

the passing to the irreducible model goes along the line employed at the
case p = 1, namely, we enforce that the objects  and j are not closed in
terms of the irreducible koszul-tate dierential , therefore not co-cycles.
this request can be satised by adding the bosonic canonical pairs (a, ),
(h i, i) whose momenta are the non vanishing solutions to the equations

(43)

(44)

(45)

(cid:16)ip2i(cid:17) = ,
(cid:16)2ip2ij(cid:17) = j.

applying j on (45) it follows that  (jj) = 0, which further leads to

jj = 0,

9

(46)

on account of the invertibility of . the prior relation is nothing but a new
constraint of the irreducible theory

(2)  jj  0,

(47)

which is necessary in order to maintain the number of physical degrees of
freedom for the irreducible model equal with that of the redundant theory.
indeed, the number of independent constraints (3334) is equal to ten, hence
the reducible model displays ten physical degrees of freedom. the irreducible
model will possess thirty independent constraint functions corresponding to
the reducible set (3334) plus the supplementary pairs (a, ), (h i, i), which
gives eleven physical degrees of freedom. it is precisely the presence of the
new rst-class constraint (44) that restores the number of physical degrees
of freedom associated with the irreducible theory to ten. we notice that the
constraint function (2) is irreducible with respect to (3334), such that it
does not induce further antighost number one co-cycles. by introducing its
antighost p2 (which is fermionic of antighost number one), the corresponding
action of the irreducible koszul-tate operator reads as

p2 = (2).

(48)

next, we perform the redenition of the antighosts p2i and p2ij in such
a way that the new co-cycles of the type (3839) identically vanish.
in
this light, we remark that the constraint functions in (3334) are separately
reducible, such that the redenition of the antighosts p2i and p2ij can be
done in a way that does not mix these elds, namely,

p2i  p 

2i = dj

ip2j,

p2ij  p 

ijp2kl.

2ij = dkl
i and dkl

(49)

(50)

(53)

p

(54)

while, on the other hand, the properties (51) yield that the new co-cycles of
the type (3839) vanish identically, i.e.,

ip 

2i  0,

2ip 

2ij  0.

(55)

(56)

the solution to the equations (5152) exists and is expressed by (26) for dj
and by

2.2.3 generalization to arbitrary p

now, we are in the position to generalize the irreducible construction to
arbitrary values of p. the rst step resides in deriving a reducible theory
involving more elds. to this end, we introduce the antisymmetric bosonic
canonical pairs

(cid:16)aj1...jp2k2, j1...jp2k2(cid:17)k=0,,c

, (cid:16)h i1...ip2k1, i1...ip2k1(cid:17)k=0,,a

,

(66)

and, acting accordingly some homological arguments similar to those used
previously, we infer the following irreducible rst-class set corresponding to
(45)

(2)
i1...ip2k1  0, k = 0, . . . , a,

(2)
i1...ip2k   (p  2k + 1) iii1...ip2k 
[i1  i2...ip2k]  0, k = 0, . . . , b,

(67)

(68)

with

(2)

i1...ip2k1  


i1...ip1  [i1

g(2)
 i2...ip1], k = 0,
 (p  2k) iii1...ip2k1  [i1

 i2...ip2k1], k = 1, . . . , a,

(69)

where we employed the notations

a = ( p

2  1, if p even,
p1
2 , if p odd,

, b = ( p

2 , if p even,
p1
2 , if p odd,

, c = ( p

2  1, if p even,
p3
2 , if p odd.

in order to infer a manifestly covariant path integral for the irreducible
theory it is still necessary to add some supplementary canonical pairs subject
to some additional constraints such that on the one hand the entire set of
resulting constraints is rst-class and irreducible, and, on the other hand,
the number of physical degrees of freedom of the irreducible theory remains
unchanged as compared to that of the redundant model. first, we introduce
the antisymmetric bosonic canonical pairs

(cid:16)a0i1...ip2k3, 0i1...ip2k3(cid:17)k=0,,d

, (cid:16)h 0i1...ip2k2, 0i1...ip2k2(cid:17)k=0,,c

,

(70)

12

subject to the constraints

0i1...ip2k3  0, 0i1...ip2k2  0,

(71)

where d is dened by

d = ( p

2  2, if p even,
p3
2 , if p odd.

we redenote the constraints (23) together with (71) by

(1)
i1...ip2k1  0i1...ip2k1  0, k = 0,    , a,

(1)
i1...ip2k  0i1...ip2k  0, k = 0,    , b.

(72)

(73)

thus, the irreducible model is described until now by the irreducible abelian
rst-class constraints (6768) and (7273). we take the rst-class hamilto-
nian with respect to these constraints under the form

h  = z d2p+1x

second, to every pair (66) we associate two more antisymmetric bosonic pairs,
respectively denoted by

(cid:16)b(1)i1 ip2k2, (1)
(cid:16)v (1)i1 ip2k1, (1)

i1ip2k2(cid:17) , (cid:16)b(2)i1 ip2k2, (2)

i1ip2k1(cid:17) , k = 0,    , a,

(76)

which we demand to be constrained by

 (1)
i1...ip2k2  (1)

i1...ip2k2  0, k = 0, . . . , c,

 (1)
i1...ip2k1  (1)

(79)

(80)

in the meantime, it is well-known that one can always add to a set of rst-
class constraints any combination of rst-class constraints whose coecients
determine an invertible matrix without aicting the theory. we notice that
from the concrete form of the constraint functions in (6768) one can express

thus, in view of the above observation, we can redene the constraints (77

the introduction of the pairs (7576) is motivated by the fact that our irre-
ducible hamiltonian formalism is intended to lead to some corresponding la-
grangian gauge transformations that are manifestly lorentz covariant. thus,
we need to replace the gauge parameters associated with the rst-stage re-
ducibility functions in the reducible context by some other parameters that
render the lorentz covariance of the lagrangian gauge variations of the elds
from the irreducible framework. these parameters are oered precisely by
the presence of the supplementary rst-class constraints (7980) and (83
84). as a consequence of the above redenitions, the theory having the con-
straints (6768), (7273), (7980) and (8384) is still irreducible, rst-class,
abelian, and has the same number of physical degrees of freedom like the
original model. the rst-class hamiltonian with respect to these irreducible
constraints can be taken under the form

in this manner, we constructed an irreducible model (described by the rst-
class constraints (6768), (7273), (7980), (8384) and by the rst-class
hamiltonian (85)) associated with topologically coupled p- and (p + 1)-forms.

2.3 irreducible hamiltonian brst symmetry

in this subsection we focus on the construction of the hamiltonian brst
symmetry for the irreducible model derived in the above. the irreducible
brst dierential si has a simple structure due to the abelian character
of the irreducible rst-class constraint set, containing only the irreducible
koszul-tate operator  and the exterior derivative along the gauge orbits
d. the irreducible koszul-tate complex contains the fermionic antighost
number one minimal antighosts

respectively associated with the rst-class constraints (72), (67), (83), (79),
(73), (68), (84) and (80). the denitions of  acting on the variables in the
minimal koszul-tate complex take the usual form

where za can be any of the original eld/momenta or newly added canonical
variable from the pairs (66), (70) or (7576). these denitions ensure the
acyclicity at non-vanishing antighost numbers, as well as the nilpotency of ,
as required by the brst formalism. the longitudinal complex involves the
minimal ghost spectrum

where f is any function of za, and g generically denotes the minimal ghost

strongly nilpotent. by enhancing the action of  to the ghosts through

g = 0,

(97)

and the action of d to the antighosts (8687) (which we globally denote by
p) like

dp = 0,

(98)

the homological perturbation theory [25][28] guarantees the existence of the
irreducible hamiltonian brst symmetry, si =  + d, that is nilpotent,
s2
i = 0. the brst dierential is graded accordingly the ghost number (gh),
dened like the dierence between the pure ghost number and the antighost

16

number. this completes the construction of an irreducible brst symmetry
for the irreducible model deriving from topologically coupled p- and (p + 1)-
forms. the next step is to establish the relationship between the irreducible
brst symmetry built here and the standard reducible hamiltonian brst
symmetry of the original model.

2.4 classical relationship between the reducible and

irreducible models

in order to clarify the link between the reducible and irreducible brst sym-
metries we show that the two models are physically equivalent. a simple
count indicates that the numbers of physical (independent) degrees of free-
dom of the reducible, respectively, irreducible models coincide. thus, we
have to investigate only the equality between the sets of physical observables
corresponding to the irreducible and reducible systems. (we recall that a
classical observable is a gauge invariant function.) first, we show that any
observable corresponding to the irreducible model is also an observable for
the reducible one. to this end, we start with an observable f of the irre-
ducible theory, that should verify the equations

hf, (1)

i1...ip2k1i  0, k = 0,    , a, hf, (1)

i1...ip2ki  0, k = 0,    , b,

i1...ip2k2i  0, k = 0,    , c, hf, (2)

hf, (1)
hf, (2)
the equations (99) induce that f does not involve, at least weakly, the elds
(a0i1...ip2k1)k=0,,a and (h 0i1...ip2k)k=0,,b. on the other hand, the equations
(102) coupled with the relations (8182) and (100101) lead to

i1...ip2k1i  0, k = 0,    , a,
i1...ip2k1i  0, k = 0,    , a.

(102)

thus, the equations (103) and (104) indicate that f does not depend, also

i1...ip2k2i  0, k = 0,    , c, hf, (1)

hf, (1)
i1...ip2k1i  0, k = 0,    , a. (104)
at least weakly, on the newly added elds (cid:16)b(1)i1 ip2k2, b(2)i1 ip2k2(cid:17)k=0,,c

17

and (cid:16)v (1)i1 ip2k1, v (2)i1 ip2k1(cid:17)k=0,,a

tions (100) and (101). for deniteness, we approach here the case p even, the
other one being solved in a similar manner. we begin with the last relation
(100) (assuming that p is even)

. let us investigate now the condi-

 2i

y [f (x) , ii1 (y)]  y

i1 [f (x) ,  (y)]  0.

(105)

applying i1

y on (105), we infer i1

y y

i1 [f (x) ,  (y)]  0, which further yields

[f (x) ,  (y)]  0.

substituting (106) in (105), we get

i
y [f (x) , ii1 (y)]  0.

applying i1

y on the next relation (100), namely,

(106)

(107)

2i
y

y [f (x) , ii1i2i3 (y)]  y
i3 [f (x) , i1i2 (y)]  0,

i1 [f (x) , i2i3 (y)]  y

i2 [f (x) , i3i1 (y)] 

and using (107), we derive i1

y y

i1 [f (x) , i2i3 (y)]  0, hence

[f (x) , i2i3 (y)]  0.

hf (x) , g(2)

i1ip1 (y)i  0.

if we act along the same line, but starting from the last equation (101), we
will accordingly arrive at

hf (x) , i1 ip2k1 (y)i  0, k = 0,    , a,

which, substituted in (101) for k = 0 imply

hf (x) , g(2)

i1 ip (y)i  0.

18

(112)

(113)

replacing the above result in (108) and reprising the same program on the
next relations (100), we are led to

hf (x) , i1 ip2k2 (y)i  0, k = 0,    , c,

which, inserted into the rst equation (100), yield

(108)

(109)

(110)

(111)

the equations (110) and (112) indicate that f does not depend, at least
weakly, on the elds (ai1...ip2k2)k=0,,c and (h i1...ip2k1)k=0,,a. we can
summarize the prior results by stating that if f denotes an observable of the
irreducible theory, then it does not depend on any of the newly introduced
elds (66), (70) and (7576). moreover, it satises the relations

(114)

hf (x) , g(1)

i1ip1 (y)i  0, hf (x) , g(1)

i1ip (y)i  0,

(see (99) for k = 0), and also (111), (113), which are precisely the equations
veried by an observable of the reducible model. all these show that if f is
an observable of the irreducible theory, then it is also an observable of the
redundant system. the converse is valid, too, because any observable of the
redundant model checks the equations (111), (113114), and does not depend
on the newly added canonical pairs, such that (99103) are automatically
satised. thus, as both the irreducible and reducible models display the same
physical observables, the zeroth order cohomological groups of the reducible
and irreducible brst symmetries, sr and si, are equal

h 0 (sr) = h 0 (si) .

(115)

in view of this, the reducible and irreducible models are equivalent from the
brst formalism point of view, i.e., from the point of view of the basic re-
quirements of the brst symmetry, s2 = 0 and h 0 (s) = {physical observables}.
as a consequence, we can substitute the reducible hamiltonian brst sym-
metry for the original system by that of the irreducible theory. this further
implies that at the brst quantization level we can also replace the hamilto-
nian brst quantization of topologically coupled abelian p- and (p + 1)-forms
with that of the irreducible rst-class theory.

2.5 hamiltonian brst quantization of the irreducible

theory

in the sequel we rely on the last conclusion and investigate the hamiltonian
brst quantization of the irreducible model. the minimal antighost and
ghost spectra are oered by (8687) and (9394). it is convenient to work
with the non-minimal sector

it is easy to check that the gauge-xed action (124) has no residual gauge
invariances. hence, following our irreducible treatment, we inferred a path
integral for topologically coupled p- and (p + 1)-form gauge elds that in-
volves no ghosts for ghosts, and, in addition, is lorentz covariant.

22

3 irreducible treatment for interacting the-

ories with topological coupling

in the sequel we extend our irreducible treatment to interacting gauge the-
ories with topological coupling. a possibility would be to investigate the
canonical analysis of the interacting theory and then develop an irreducible
method along the lines exposed in the previous section. a major diculty in
implementing this program is that the interaction terms may involve higher
order derivatives of the elds, which would make the canonical approach too
complicated. an alternative that surpasses this inconvenient is to analyze
whether our irreducible hamiltonian procedure induces a corresponding ir-
reducible lagrangian version, and, if the answer is armative, to solve the
interacting case within the irreducible lagrangian context. we will see that
this idea can be consistently enforced, our irreducible hamiltonian scheme
for topologically coupled p- and (p + 1)-form gauge elds allowing indeed
an irreducible lagrangian formalism that maintains the space-time locality
and lorentz covariance of the resulting gauge-xed action. the manifest co-
variance will be restored precisely due to the introduction in the theory of
the supplementary canonical pairs (7576). while in the hamiltonian back-
ground the distinction between primary and secondary constraints is not
signicant, this aspect becomes important at the lagrangian level in order
to obtain the gauge transformations of the lagrangian action. this is why
in what follows we work with a model of irreducible hamiltonian theory in
the case of topological coupling in the framework of which we assume that
(72), (73), (8384) are primary constraints whose consistencies respectively
imply the secondary ones (67), (68), (7980). the derivation of the gauge
transformations of our irreducible model involves three steps. first, we write
down the associated extended action

and determine its gauge invariances. in the last relation h is given by (85),
while the u()s and u()s represent the lagrange multipliers of the corre-
sponding constraints. second, on the one hand with the help of the extended
action (133) we infer the so-called total action by setting zero all the multi-
pliers carrying the index (2) (and associated by virtue of our choice with the
secondary constraints of the irreducible model), and, on the other hand, we
determine the gauge invariances of the total action by taking all the gauge
variations of the multipliers associated with the secondary constraints to
vanish. third, we deduce the lagrangian action for the irreducible model
together with its gauge invariances by eliminating all the momenta and the
remaining lagrange multipliers on their equations of motion resulting from
the total formalism. in addition, we notice that the elds carrying the su-
perscript (2) and also (aj1...jp2k2)k=0,,c, (h i1...ip2k1)k=0,,a are auxiliary
variables, hence we can remove them from the irreducible model. as a result
of this three-step algorithm, we get that the lagrangian action implied by
the irreducible hamiltonian theory is nothing but the original action

while the corresponding gauge transformations, which can be checked to be

where the parameters (i1 ip2k2, i1ip2k1) correspond to the constraints
(79), respectively, (67), while (i1 ip2k1, i1 ip2k ) are associated with the
constraints (80), respectively, (68). we remark that the gauge variations
(135) and (137) involved with the original elds a1...p and h 1...p+1 are
nothing but the gauge invariances of the original action (1). however, al-
though these transformations alone are reducible, the entire set of gauge
transformations (135138) connected to the larger eld spectrum is irre-
ducible.
in this manner we constructed an irreducible lagrangian model
originating in our irreducible hamiltonian approach addressed in the previ-
ous section.
it can be shown that we can recover the relations (123124)
in the framework of the antield-brst quantization of this irreducible la-
grangian model by using an appropriate non-minimal sector and gauge-xing
fermion. the non-minimal solution to the master equation for the irreducible
lagrangian system reads as

in consequence, we emphasized how our irreducible hamiltonian procedure
gives rise to an irreducible covariant lagrangian approach for topologically
coupled p- and (p + 1)-form gauge elds that outputs the path integral de-
rived in the hamiltonian context. taking into consideration this result, the
interaction case can be solved in a direct manner. indeed, if one adds to the
lagrangian action (1) some interaction terms which are invariant under the
original reducible gauge transformations (135) and (137), then the starting
point toward an irreducible lagrangian approach to the interacting system
is represented by the interacting lagrangian action subject to the irreducible
gauge transformations (135138) of the broader eld spectrum. the main
point is that even if the interaction terms involve higher-order derivatives of
the elds, this does not aict in any way our procedure as the interacting
lagrangian action satises the same noether identities like in the absence of
the interaction. therefore, the non-minimal solution to the master equation
results from (141) in which we replace sl
0 with the action of the interact-
ing lagrangian model under study. consequently, we can still employ the
gauge-xing fermion (142), which will produce a gauge-xed action of the
type (124) excepting the starting lagrangian action that must contain the
gauge-invariant interaction terms. moreover, our formalism can yet be ex-
tended to interacting theories like the ones discussed above which contain

26

more sorts of abelian p-form gauge elds. these theories are important in
order to derive all consistent interactions between p-form gauge elds [24].
in this light, our irreducible hamiltonian procedure gives rise to an irre-
ducible lagrangian approach which proves to be ecient at the irreducible
investigation of interacting theories with topological coupling.

4 conclusion

in this paper we develop a consistent irreducible hamiltonian brst treat-
ment of p-form gauge theories with topological coupling. we start with a
quadratic action describing topologically coupled abelian p- and (p + 1)-form
gauge elds and construct an irreducible hamiltonian rst-class model that
is equivalent at the brst quantization level with the starting redundant
theory. the irreducibility is enforced in the background of the koszul-tate
complex via making all the initial antighost number one co-cycles of the
koszul-tate dierential to vanish identically under a proper rotation of the
antighost number one antighosts such that the total number of physical de-
grees of freedom does not vary. the irreducible hamiltonian analysis of the
initial quadratic action presents the desirable feature that it induces a corre-
sponding irreducible lagrangian version, which, in turn, is the most natural
framework for investigating higher-order interacting lagrangian gauge the-
ories with topological coupling. finally, we remark that our analysis covers
the free case in the limit m  0.
