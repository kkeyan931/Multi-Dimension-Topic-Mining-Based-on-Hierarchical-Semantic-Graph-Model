1.t-duality in string theory is a subject which has been keeping attracting
attention in the last few years. apart from the well-understood abelian t-
duality [1], there persists a problem of interpreting the mirror symmetry
as a sort of t-duality [2].
in particular, the calabi-yau manifolds do not
have abelian (or non-abelian) groups of isometries needed for applying the
abelian t-duality. obviously a framework is needed which would enable
us to dualize the models living on targets without necessarily requiring any
isometry. a step forward was made in the work [3], where the traditional non-
abelian t-duality [4] was generalized to the so-called poisson-lie t-duality.
the latter duality is based on a generalisation of the standard isometries
called poisson-lie symmetries and it basically replaces one poisson-lie group
(target space) with its dual poisson-lie group (dual target). in a subsequent
series of papers [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] the poisson-lie t-duality has been well
developped in many of its aspects; perhaps the most important contributions
from the structural point of view were two papers:
[6] and [7]. in [6] the
global aspects of the poisson-lie t-duality have been addressed.it was found
that the duality takes place not only between the pairs of the poisson-lie
groups but more generally between the pairs of coset spaces d/g and d/ g
where d is a so-called drinfeld double and g, g is a pair of its maximally
isotropic soubgroups. in [7] the duality was further generalized to incorporate
pairs of double coset spaces f \d/g and f \d/ g, where f is some isotropic
subgroup of d that is not necessarily maximally isotropic. this double coset
duality was referred to as the dressing coset duality because in the case when
d/ g = g, f indeed acts on g in the dressing way.

an interesting aspect of the dressing cosets f \d/g is that they are not
necessarily nonsingular manifolds as the targets d/g. moreover, there seems
to be no natural group action on the targets f \d/g as it is the case for d/g.
all this makes the dressing cosets to be suciently wild objects in order to
have some hope that they could include the calabi-yau manifolds. however,
at the present stage it is still a somewhat premature discussion and in this
note we wish to concentrate on another important aspect of the poisson-lie
t-duality: a conformal invariance of the corresponding -models.

the issue of the conformal invariance has been always somewhat myste-
rious in the framework of the poisson-lie t-duality which, so far, is mainly a
classical story. nevertheless, it turned out that the wzw model on compact
groups, which is certainly conformal also at the quantum level, ts very nat-
urally in the framework of the single coset (d/g  d/ g) duality [5]. it is

1

the purpose of this note to show that the gauged wzw models also t very
well into the framework of the poisson-lie t-duality but at the double coset
level f \d/g. we shall then coclude that the poisson-lie t-duality concerns
very directly the conformal backgrounds and presumably also realistic string
models.

we shall actually work out also supersymmetric gauged wzw models.
in the long run, it should perhaps lead to new insights in the n = 2 case
since it is well-known that some points of the modular space of the calabi-yau
compactications can be indeed written as (an orbifold of) the tensor product
of the (quantum) supersymmetric gauged wzw models. in the n = 2 wzw
model the poisson-lie t-duality was shown to have the same eect on the
supercurrents as the usual mirror map [10] and it was conjectured there that
this should be the case also for the kazama-suzuki models [12]. it would be
eventually interesting to identify the poisson-lie t-duality with the mirror
map also in the calabi-yau case.

in what follows, we shall shortly review the theory of the dressing cosets
[7]. then we shall present the particular construction which gives the gauged
wzw model for a large class of groups g and their subgroups h. the dress-
ing coset duality in this context will intersect with the kiritsis-obers du-
ality. finally, we shall give the supersymmetric generalization of the bosonic
picture.

2. consider a 2n-dimensional lie group d whose lie algebra d is equipped
with a symmetric invariant non-degenerate bilinear form  ., . .
it is
required that d also possess two n-dimensional non-conjugated subgroups
g, g such that their lie algebras g, g are isotropic. consider now an n-
dimensional linear subspace e  d such that it intersects with its orthogonal
complement e  in an isotropic lie algebra f , i.e.

e  e  = f ;

[f , f ]  f .

(1)

moreover, both e and e  should be invariant subspaces with respect to the
adjoint action of f :

[f , e]  e,

[f , e ]  e .

(2)

it was shown in [7] that all these data dene a pair of dual non-linear -models
living respectively, on the targets f \d/g and f \d/ g. their common dy-

namics is encoded in the rst order hamiltonian action [7]

(3)

here l(,  ) = l( + 2,  ) is a mapping from a cylindrical worldsheet into
the group manifold d and ll1 is constrained to lie in f :

ll1  f .

note that due to the non-degeneracy of the form  ., .  we have

f  = span(e, e ).

(4)

(5)

we should also explain the meaning of the subscripts 0 and 1 in (3). we can
write arbitrary element x  f  as

x = x0 + x1,

x0  e,

x1  e .

(6)

of course, this decomposition is not unique, because the linear spaces e and
e  intersect at f . the decomposition x = x
0 = x0 +  and
x
1 = x1  , is equally good for an arbitrary   f . however, due to the
fact that  f , e = f , e  = 0, the action (3) does not depend on this
decomposition.

1, where x

0 + x

the action (3) possesses the following bosonic gauge symmetry l 

f l, f (,  )  f which explains why we take the left coset f \d/g.

the way how to obtain the dual pair of the -models from the action
(3) was described in [5]. here we shall review it for the particular choice
of the drinfeld double and its subgroups which leads to the gauged wzw
model. the double is the direct product d = g  g where g is a real
lie group whose lie algebra g is itself equipped with a symmetric invariant
nondegenerate bilinear form. note, however, that in distinction with the
group d, the form < ., . > need not have any null vectors. this is the case,
for instance, for simple compact groups and their killing-cartan forms. we
shall moreover require an existence of an outer automorphism  of g such
that it preserves the bilinear form. for example, all groups su(n); n  3

3

full our requirements. the bilinear form  ., .  on the lie algebra d of
d for any pair of elements (x, y ), (u, v )  d is given by

 (x, y ), (u, v ) =< x, u >  < y, v > .

(7)

two maximally isotropic subgroups g  d and g  d are dened as
follows

g = {(g, g)  d; g  g}, g = {((g), g)  d; g  g}.

(8)

now let us x some lie subgroup h of g such that the restriction of
< ., . > on its lie algebra h is non-degenerate. the subspaces e, e  dening
the dressing coset models on f \d/g and on f \d/g are given as follows

e = (h, 0)  (h, h);

e  = (0, h)  (h, h).

(9)

the subalgebra f and the subspace f  are given by

f = (h, h), f  = (h, 0)  (h, h)  (0, h).

(10)

we note immediately that f = h   d and that the conditions (1) and (2)
are satised. hence we have a special case of the dressing coset construction.
it is easy to identify the target of the model f \d/g = h \g  g/g.

first of all, we note that every element l of g  g can be written as

l = (k, 1)(g, g);

k, g  g.

(11)

hence the simple coset g  g/g can be obviously identied with g. let us
now act from the left on l by some element (h, h)  h . we obtain

(h, h)(k, 1)(g, g) = (hkg, hg) = (hkh1, 1)(hg, hg).

(12)

from here we conclude that the target is simply g/ad(h), which is the same
thing as the target of the gauged g/h wzw model. in the same way we can
nd the dual target h \g  g/g. it is given by the cosets of the following
action of h on g: hg = hg(h)1. if h is stable with respect to the action of
the automorphism  and the restriction of  on h is an outer automorphism
of h, we obtain the target of the axially gauged wzw model in the sense
of bars & sfetsos and kiritsis & obers [13, 14]. if h is not stable then we
are in the framework of chung & tye [15].

4

in the setting (9-10) and with the ansatz (11) the action (3) of our dressing

coset becomes

s[k, g] =

1

2 z d d < kk1,  kk1 > +
+z d d{< k1 k, gg1 > 

1

12 z d1 < dkk1, [dkk1, dkk1] >

1
2

< k1k, k1k >

 < k1k, gg1 >  < p gg1, gg1 >}.

(13)

in deriving (13), we have used the polyakov-wiegmann formula [16] and the
fact that g is isotropic. the notations : p, p  are the projectors on the
subspaces h and h  correspondingly; ad(k)x = kxk1.

the constraint (4) becomes:

p gg1 = (1  p ad(k)p )1p (kk1 + ad(k)p gg1).

(14)

inserting p gg1 from (14) back into the action we obtain an expression

which depends on g only via p gg1:
2 z d d < kk1,  kk1 > +

s[k, g] =

1

1

12 z d1 < dkk1, [dkk1, dkk1] >

+z d d{< k1k, p gg1

+

(1  p ad(k)p )1p (kk1 + ad(k)p gg1) >

1
2
1

< k1k, k1k >  < p gg1, gg1 >}.

(15)

after solving away the eld p gg1, we nally obtain the action:
s[k] = z d+d 1

< kk1, +kk1 > +

12 z d1 < dkk1, [dkk1, dkk1] >

2

1

+ z d+d < k1k, (1  p ad(k)p )1p +kk1 > .

(16)

this is the same action that we obtain if we integrate out the gauge elds
a+, a  h from the gauged wzw action of the coset model g/ad(h):

s[k] =

1

2 z d+d < +kk1, kk1 > +

1

12 z d1 < dkk1, [dkk1, dkk1] >

5

2z d+d{< +kk1, a >

 < k1k, a+ >  < a, a+ > + < a, ad(k)a+ >},

(17)

note that we have used here the light-cone variables of integration

d = (d  d)/2.

(18)

the action of the model dual to (16) can be obtained from the duality

invariant action (3) by using the ansatz

l = (k, 1)((g), g)

(19)

and solving away the eld g. the result is the action

s[k] =

1

2 z d+d < kk1, +kk1 > +

1

12 z d1 < dkk1, [dkk1, dkk1] >

+ z d+d{< (1)k1k, (1  p ad(k)p )1p +kk1 >},

(20)

where  denotes the push forward map g  g.

3. the supersymmetric case. strictly speaking, the theory of the super-
symmetric dressing cosets has not been so far discussed in the literature. on
the other hand, it is not dicult to develop it since the principal tool, the
duality invariant action for the supersymmetric d/g  d/ g duality, has
been found already in [8]. thus we nd after some work that the action for
the supersymmetric dressing cosets is given by

s[l, ] =

1

2 z dd  ll1,  ll1  +

12 z d1  dll1, [dll1, dll1]

the analogue of the constraint (4) is now

moreover, the fermions  full

+  e,   e 

and the consistency requires that

[e, e ]  f .

(22)

(23)

(24)

the latter requirement is indeed fullled for our particular choice (9-10).

the action (21) possesses the following bosonic gauge symmetry

l  f l,   f f 1,

f (,  )  f ;

and the following fermionic gauge symmetry

   + ,

(,  )  f .

(25)

(26)

the target spaces of the corresponding dual pair of the -model are the same
as in the bosonic case.

now for our concrete case (9) and (10), we can parametrize the fermions

as

+ = (+, 0) + (+, +),  = (0, ) + (, ),

(27)

where   h and   h.

the fermionic gauge symmetry (25) can be used to set  = 0. in what
follows, we shall always use this particular gauge. then the action of our
supersymmetric dressing coset is

s[l, ] =

1

2 z d d < kk1,  kk1 > +

1

12 z d1 < dkk1, [dkk1, dkk1] >)

+z d d{< k1 k, gg1 >

(28)

with the constraint

p (kk1  (1  ad(k))gg1 +

1
2

(++ + )) = 0.

(29)

now one rst expresses p gg1 from the constraint (28) and inserts it back
into the action (27). then one can solve away also the eld p gg1. as a
result we obtain the action of the nonabelian coset model g/ad(h).

s[k, ] =

1

2 z d+d < kk1, +kk1 > +
+z d+d{

1
2

1

12 z d1 < dkk1, [dkk1, dkk1] >

+ < k1k  , (1  p ad(k)p )1p (+kk1 + ++) >}.

(30)

this is the same action we would obtain if to integrate out the gauge elds
a+, a from the gauged wzw action of the coset model g/ad(h):

s[k, ] =

1

2 z d+d < kk1, +kk1 > +

1

12 z d1 < dkk1, [dkk1, dkk1]

2z d+d{

2

(< +, + + [a, +] >

+ < , + + [a+, ] >)+ < +kk1, a >

 < k1k, a+ >  < a, a+ > + < a, ad(k)a+ >}.

(31)

the action of the model dual to (29) reads

s[k, ] =

1

2 z d+d < kk1, +kk1 > +
+z d+d{

1
2

(< +, + > + < , + >)

1

12 z d1 < dkk1, [dkk1, dkk1] >

+ < (1)k1k  , (1  p ad(k)p )1p (+kk1 + ++) >}. (32)
