(16) embedding describes conguration m2-brane wrapping ex- clusively around eleventh-direction. therefore, ten-dimensions, becomes string extending towards r-direction. embedding eqs.(15) become c : b : : (gg) = 0, h = gj f 1 gh = 0. = (gga) 2rt z d3(10)(x x )ij1ix jx , (17) let g = 0. current couples ns-ns 2-form b read gjtr f 1 = rt ()()(6)(x). thus charge fundamental string, qf 1 = z d6xddgjtr = 2rt.
