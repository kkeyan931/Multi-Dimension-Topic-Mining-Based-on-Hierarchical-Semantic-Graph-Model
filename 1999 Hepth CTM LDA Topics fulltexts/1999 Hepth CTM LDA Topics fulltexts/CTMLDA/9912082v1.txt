abstract

we determine the low energy dynamics of monopoles in pure n = 2 yang-
mills theories for points in the vacuum moduli space where the two higgs
elds are not aligned. the dynamics is governed by a supersymmetric
quantum mechanics with potential terms and four real supercharges. the
corresponding superalgebra contains a central charge but nevertheless su-
persymmetric states preserve all four supercharges. the central charge
depends on the sign of the electric charges and consequently so does the
bps spectrum. we focus on the su(3) case where certain bps states are
realised as zero-modes of a dirac operator on taub-nut space twisted
by the tri-holomorphic killing vector eld. we show that the bps spec-
trum includes hypermultiplets that are consistent with the strong- and
weak-coupling behaviour of the seiberg-witten theory.

1 introduction

the bps spectrum of monopoles and dyons are an important non-perturbative feature
of supersymmetric yang-mills theories. at weak coupling one can determine the
bps spectrum using semi-classical techniques. following [1, 2], the bps spectrum of
n = 2 and n = 4 theories was studied in a number of papers [3, 4, 5, 6] at points
in the moduli space of vacua where only a single higgs eld was involved, or more
precisely where all of the higgs elds were aligned. in these cases one studies certain
supersymmetric quantum mechanics models with the target manifold given by the
moduli space of classical bps monopole solutions.

new features arise when one studies the spectrum at points in the moduli space
where the higgs elds are not aligned [7, 8, 9]. for theories with n = 4 supersym-
metry, the bps bound is determined by two complex central charges that appear in
the supersymmetry algebra. for aligned higgs elds the two charges are necessarily
equal and a bps state preserves 1/2 of the supersymmetry. when the six higgs elds
are not aligned the central charges can be dierent and then the bps states preserve
1/4 of the supersymmetry.

the low energy dynamics of monopoles for non-aligned higgs elds in n = 4
theories were recently studied by bak. et. al [10]. the supersymmetric quantum
mechanics is still based on the same bps monopole moduli space, but is now sup-
plemented by a supersymmetric potential term which is constructed from a set of
tri-holomorphic killing vector elds that generate unbroken u(1) gauge symmetries.
it was noticed in ref. [11] that this potential naturally appears in the expression
for the energy of bps states, while bak et.al. later showed how the same potential
occurs in the low energy dynamics, albeit with an important multiplicative factor of
1/2, and used the resulting lagrangian to study the spectrum of n = 4 yang-mills,
including 1/4 bps states.

in this paper we will analyse analogous issues for pure n = 2 supersymmetric
yang-mills theories. since the n = 2 supersymmetry algebra has one complex central
charge there can only be bps states preserving 1/2 of the supersymmetry. since the
pure n = 2 yang-mills theory can be embedded in the n = 4 theory it is not
surprising that the central charge is one of the central charges that appear in the
n = 4 theory. it is interesting that the other n = 4 central charge also appears as
a bound on the classical mass of dyons, but it is no longer related to preservation of
supersymmetry. if this latter bound is stronger than the bps bound for a given set
of charges, then no bps state can exist with those charges.

at points in the vacuum moduli space of pure n = 2 yang-mills theories where
the higgs elds are aligned, the low energy dynamics is a supersymmetric quantum
mechanics on the moduli space of bps monopoles with four real supersymmetries [1].
the bps states correspond to harmonic spinors on the monopole moduli space (or
equivalently, on a hyperkahler manifold, harmonic holomorphic forms). this follows
from the simple fact that one of the low energy supercharges q is proportional to a

1

dirac operator on the moduli space,

d = i,

(1)

with covariant derivative on the moduli space , and its square gives the supersym-
metric sigma-model hamiltonian.

q2 =

1
2 d2 = h0.

(2)

with two higgs elds active, we will argue that the low energy dynamics includes
a supersymmetric potential term as in the n = 4 theories [10]. the only dierence
from the n = 4 case is that the number of fermions and the number of supercharges is
reduced by half. we will write down this low energy lagrangian explicitly in section
3. the supercharge is now given by the dirac operator twisted by a tri-holomorphic
vector eld g. the superalgebra then has the general form,

q2 =

1
2

(d  g)2 = h  z,

(3)

where h is the modied hamiltonian, and z is a real central charge dened by the
lie derivative along g,
(4)

z = ilg,

and measures a linear combination of electric charges.

the bps states with h = z preserve not only the supercharge q but, as we
will show, all four supercharges. this is consistent with preservation of 1/2 of the
spacetime supersymmetry.
it is interesting to note that if we ip the signs of the
electric charges so that z  z, the state will no longer be bps. this should be
contrasted with the n = 4 theory, where bps states with electric charges of both
signs may occur and break a further half of the supersymmetries in general.

we will analyze in some detail the simplest case of su(3) broken to u(1)  u(1)
by two adjoint higgs. in particular we will focus on bps states with a (1, 1) magnetic
charge. the bps monopole moduli space for this case is given by r3  (r  m)/z
where m is taub-nut space [5, 12]. the bps spectrum is then determined by solving
the dirac equation on the taub-nut manifold twisted by the tri-holomorphic killing
vector eld and we will be able to utilise the results of pope who studied precisely
the same operator in [14].

an early analysis of the bps spectrum of n = 2 su(3) yang-mills theories in the
weak coupling regime was carried out in the context of seiberg-witten theories [15] by
fraser and hollowood [16]. acting with semi-classical monodromy transformations on
purely magnetic states, they found new states in a certain part of the vacuum moduli
space whose magnetic charge is (1, 1) and whose electric charge is (n, n  1) with
arbitrary integer n. since the monodromy cannot alter the supermultiplet structures,
all of these dyons ll out hypermultiplets. by solving the low energy dynamics of
two distinct monopoles, we will nd that these are a particular case of more general

2

states with electric charges, (m, l) where integers m and l are such that m > l. the
size of supermultiplet of the bps state grows linearly with the positive integer m l.
this paper is organised as follows. section 2 will briey summarise the classical
energy bound of the pure n = 2 yang-mills theory. we will show that there are two
bounds on the classical energy and only one of them corresponds to a bps bound.
in section 3 we will present the supersymmetric quantum mechanics with potential
that should describe the low-energy dynamics of monopoles and dyons. we analyze
the conditions for preserved supersymmetry and use this in section 4 to analyze
the bps spectrum for the case of su(3). in section 5, we summarise some of the
previously known results on the spectrum of pure su(3) seiberg-witten theory from
monodromies as well as strong coupling singularities in the vacuum moduli space,
and show that the results are consistent with those in section 4. we conclude in
section 6.

the n = 2 super-yang-mills lagrangian is given by

l =

(5)

where i, i = 1, 2 denote the two real higgs elds, di = i  ie[a, i] and  is
a dirac spinor and all elds are in the adjoint representation of the gauge group g.
the vacuum moduli space demands that [1, 2] = 0; we may choose the asymptotic
values of the higgs elds along the positive z-axis, say, to be in the cartan sub-
algebra, i = i  h, where i are vectors of dimension r=rank(g). this does
not completely x the gauge transformations as one has the freedom to perform
discrete gauge transformations by elements of the weyl group. these can be xed
by demanding, for example, that 1  a  0 for a given set of simple roots a of the
lie algebra g of g. we will only consider points in the moduli space of vacua where
the symmetry is maximally broken to u(1)r.

for a given vacuum we can dene electric and magnetic charge two-vectors

~qe = tri dsiei~ ,

~qm = tri dsibi~ ,

with i = 1, 2, 3 and ~ = (1, 2). these can be written as
m = i  g ,

by determining the central charges that appear in the supersymmetry algebra as

in [13] we can determine the bps bound:

m  |z = (q1

e  q2

m) + i(q1

m + q2

e)|.

(9)

note that if we introduce a complex rescaled higgs vector a = e(1 + i2) and
rescale the charge vectors via q = q/e and g = (e/4)g then the bps condition
becomes m = |a q + adg| where ad = (i4/e2)a which is the form familiar from
seiberg-witten theory (for vanishing ) [15].
it is illuminating to rederive the bps bound using bogomolnyis method of rewrit-
ing the energy as a sum of squares plus conserved charges. indeed we will see that
this gives rise to two bounds on the classical energy. since the bosonic part of the
n = 2 lagrangian diers from the n = 4 theory only in the fact that there are two
higgs elds instead of six higgs, one can immediately adapt the derivation of general
bps bound for the n = 4 theory [7, 9] to the n = 2 case. one nds that the most
stringent bound on the mass is given by

m  q| ~qe|2 + | ~qm|2 + 2| ~qe|| ~qm| sin 

= max (q| ~qe|2 + | ~qm|2  2(q2

mq1

e  q1

mq2

e)),

(10)

where 0     is the angle between the two 2-vectors ~qe and ~qm. this is equivalent
to
(11)

m) + i(q1

m  max |z = (q1

e  q2

m  q2

e)|.

in n = 4 theories, z appear as central charges in the supersymmetry algebra.
if a state saturates the bps bound (11) it will preserve 1/4 of the supersymmetry.
in cases where z+ = z, which occurs when the angle between ~qe and ~qm vanishes,
the state will preserve 1/2 of the supersymmetry. by contrast, in n = 2 theories
there is only one complex central charge that appears in the supersymmetry algebra1,
z, giving rise to the bps bound (9). a state saturating this bound will preserve
1/2 of the supersymmetry. a classical soliton can only saturate the larger of the two
bounds, |z|. thus, if it so happens that |z| < |z+| then there can be no classical
bps soliton with such charges in such a vacuum. in particular, suppose that a state
of charge (g, q) saturates the bps bound |z| > |z+|. then, for a state of charge
(g,q), the bps bound |z| will be smaller than the classical energy bound |z+|.
in the asymptotic region of vacuum moduli space where a semi-classical analysis is
suitable the quantum corrections to the classical soliton mass will be small and we
conclude that that the latter state cannot be bps saturated. this asymmetry with
respect to the sign of the electric charge is a generic feature of the n = 2 dyon

1if 2  2 in (5) the central charge would be z+.

spectrum. this feature will be manifest in the low energy superalgebra derived in
section 3 and will be further analysed for the specic example of su(3) in section 4.
with this knowledge in mind, let us continue exploring the energy bound further.

dening the linear combinations of higgs via

a = cos 1  sin 2,
b = sin 1 + cos 2,

using the arguments of [7, 9] the mass bound is saturated when

ei = dia,
bi = dib,

and the angle  is constrained to be

tan  =

e

q1
m  q2
q2
m  q1

e

.

in addition, in the gauge a0 = a all elds are static and gauss law becomes

d2a  e2[b, [b, a]] = 0.

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

note that the second equation in (13) is the usual bps equation for a single higgs
eld.

in terms of the vectors a, b, the mass bound can then be written

and the constraint (14) is replaced with

m  max (a  q + b  g),

a  g = b  q.

(16)

(17)

it should be emphasised that i and not a, b specify the point in vacuum moduli
space where a semi-classical analysis is relevant2 since the latter depend on g, q via
the angle .

note that for gauge group su(2), in order that [1, 2] = 0, 1 must be pro-
portional to 2. for nite energy congurations we then deduce that ~qe is propor-
tional to ~qm and hence the only bound on the mass is the bps bound given by
m 2  ( ~qe)2 + ( ~qm)2 as in [13]. it is perhaps worth commenting that even for gauge
group u(1) there are innite energy congurations with ~qe not proportional to ~qm
[17].

2this can be further illustrated for n = 4 yang-mills. to ensure a duality invariant bps
mass formula, i are invariant whilst a, b transform under sl(2, z) duality because the angle 
transforms.

3 low-energy dynamics of monopoles and dyons

for a single adjoint higgs eld, it is well known that classical bosonic dyons can
be described as monopoles with some internal momentum excited. the low-energy
dynamics is determined by a sigma-model whose classical orbits are geodesics on the
moduli space of monopole solutions. in the case of maximal symmetry breaking, the
moduli space has u(1)r symmetry, arising from global gauge transformations, and
the corresponding momenta are the conserved electric charges.

it was argued in [9] that one can similarly analyze solutions of (13),(15) by con-
structing a modied low-energy dynamics on monopole moduli spaces. given a
solution of the bps equation b = db, the other bps equation (15) is solved by
any gauge-zero mode of the solution. in the case of widely separated fundamental
monopoles [18] with respect to b, the solution can be thought of as classically bound
dyons (with respect to b). using this information, it was argued that the correct low-
energy dynamics is determined by the sigma-model supplemented with a potential
term. the arguments presented in [9] were in the context of n = 4 theories, but
since only two higgs elds were involved the arguments can be immediately adapted
to the n = 2 case. in particular, the bosonic lagrangian should be given by

1
2

l =

g z z 

1
2

ggg,

(18)

where g is the metric on the monopole moduli space, and g is a tri-holomorphic
killing vector eld on the moduli space which is associated with a certain unbroken
u(1) gauge symmetry. more precisely, g is given by

g = e a  k,

(19)

where the r killing vectors ka are generated by u(1)r unbroken gauge group acting
on the moduli space.

this low energy dynamics is a nonrelativistic approximation, so we always assume
slow motion in the moduli space of monopoles. a related but independent condition
that is needed to justify the above dynamics is that the potential energy contribution
be small compared to the rest mass of the monopoles. in particular, when we realise
dyons as bound states of monopoles, the low energy approximation is valid only if
the following condition holds,

a  q  b  g,

(20)
which is satised for weak coupling, since the left hand side  e while the right hand
side  1/e.
the above bosonic dynamics must be generalised to include fermions and super-
symmetry. monopoles preserve half of the n = 2 supersymmetry in four dimensions,
so the low energy dynamics will have exactly four real supercharges. in the absence
of the potential term (i.e., when only one higgs is active), the dynamics has been
derived and takes the following form [1],

l =

1

2(cid:18)g z z + igdt(cid:19),

(21)

6

where dt =  + 
 z. the addition of the bosonic potential g2/2 induces a
term involving fermions, and the full supersymmetric lagrangian with potential is
given by

1

l =

2(cid:18)g z z + igdt  ggg  idg(cid:19).

(22)

assuming that the target is hyperkahler and that the killing vector eld g is tri-
holomorphic, the action is invariant under the following four supersymmetry trans-
formations

z = i + iaj (a)
,
( z  g)a  iaj (a)
 = ( z  g) + j (a)



,

(23)

where , a are constant one component grassmann odd parameters. note that the
two-form dg is (1,1) with respect to all complex structures when g is tri-holomorphic.
this in turn implies that dg is anti-self-dual. the commutator of two dierent super-
symmetry transformations vanishes, while those of like supersymmetry transforma-
tions gives rise to a combination of a time translation and the symmetry generated
by the killing vector eld g:

z = kg,
 = kg

,.

(24)

this supersymmetric quantum mechanics thus has all the features we require and on
this basis we will assume that it is in fact correct.

to quantise we rst introduce a frame ea

 which commute
with all bosonic variables. the remaining canonical commutation relations are then
given by

 and dene a = ea

[z, p] = i
 ,
{a, b} = ab.

(25)
we can realise this algebra on spinors on the moduli space by letting a = a/2,
where a are gamma matrices. since the moduli space is hyperkahler an equivalent
quantization is obtained using holomorphic dierential forms. the supercovariant
momentum operator dened by

although the algebra of supercharges contains a central charge z we see that the
states will either preserve all four supersymmetries of the supersymmetric quantum
mechanics if h = z, or none. this is entirely consistent with the fact that the parent
n = 2 eld theory has a complex central charge and hence bps states preserve
1/2 of the eight eld theory supercharges, while generic states preserve none of the
supersymmetry (of course the vacuum preserves all of the supersymmetry). the bps
bound states satisfying h = z are obtained by nding the normalizable zero modes
of the following dirac operator on the moduli space,

q =

1
2

(i  g) = 0.

(36)

the bps states of the n = 2 theory are obtained by solving this equation on the
monopole moduli space specied by the higgs eld b. the spin content of the super-
multiplets will be the tensor product of that of a half-hypermultiplet, (0, 0,1/2),

8

which comes from the noninteracting center-of-mass fermions, with the spin of the
bound states on the relative moduli space. in the simplest case of a singlet bound
state we get a full hypermultiplet when combined with the corresponding states from
the anti-monopole sector.

note that bps states are only possible if the z eigenvalue is nonnegative, since h
is nonnegative3. from (19) we see that this eigenvalue is given by a linear combination
of the electric charges. since classical bosonic dyonic bound states should exist for
both signs of the electric charge (recall the bps bound and the mass bound discussed
in section 2), we expect wrong-sign non-bps dyons as quantum bound states,
unless the potential g2/2 is too weak. such states will solve only the second order
schrodinger equation,

h = e ,

(37)

and will break all of the supersymmmetries. because of this these states will form
longer n = 2 supermultiplets. for example, the smallest possible non-bps multiplet
has degeneracy 16 arising from the 4 states coming from the centre-of-mass fermions
with an additional factor of 4 arising from the supercharges acting on the bound states
on the relative moduli space. this multiplet has highest spin one. it is identical to the
n = 4 vector multiplet and is a long multiplet with respect to n = 2 supersymmetry
algebra. in the rest of paper, we will consider bps bound states only.

4 bps dyons in n = 2 su (3) yang-mills theory

we now use the supersymmetric monopole dynamics to analyze the special case of two
distinct monopoles in pure n = 2 su(3) yang-mills theory. as we discussed when
two higgs elds are involved one considers the monopole moduli space determined
by b and the eects of a are incorporated via the potential terms. recall that for
the case of a single higgs eld the classical su(3) monopoles can be built out of
two distinct species of monopoles, known as fundamental monopoles. the magnetic
charges of these fundamental monopoles correspond to the two simple roots of su(3)
lie algebra which are dened by the asymptotic behaviour of the higgs eld [18].
when two higgs elds are involved we use the expectation value of b to specify the
simple roots ,  by demanding b    0 and b    0. this is illustrated on the
root diagram in gure 1. we take the normalization such that 2 = 2 = 1 and thus
   = 1/2.
dyons built on a single  or a single  magnetic charge are easy to nd. the
moduli space is at, r3  s1, and one obtains integral electric charges by exciting
momentum along the internal u(1) angle, which give rise to integral electric charges
parallel to the magnetic charge. the possible charges (g, q)  (ge/4, q/e) are

3 this can easily be seen by introducing a complex conjugated operator q = (+ig)/2.
it satises the identity (q)2 = h+z, so that we have 2h = q2+(q)2, which is clearly nonnegative.

for integers n and m. the potential term in the quantum mechanics is constant
and just contributes to the bps mass. the quantization of the free fermions gives
a half-hypermultiplet with spin content (0, 0,1/2) which combines with the charge
conjugate states to form a full hypermultiplet.

dyons with magnetic charge  +  are more dicult to analyze since the moduli
space is now eight-dimensional. the exact metric is known [12, 5] and it factors into

where ~x is a three-vector that encodes the center of mass position of the two

the reduced mass  is dened as 12/(1 + 2). the 3-vector ~w(~r) is the dirac
potential such that   ~w(~r) = ~r/r3. the eight-dimensional, total moduli space is

where i are internal u(1) angles of the two fundamental monopoles respectively, with

the z2 action shifts  and  by 2 simultaneously. the half-integer-quantised mo-
mentum along  corresponds to overall u(1) charge in unit of e ( + ), while the
half-integer-quantised momentum along  corresponds to the relative u(1) charge in
unit of e (  ). because of the z2 action, under which the wavefunction should be
invariant, the two momenta are correlated such that either both are integers or both
are half integers.

when the second higgs expectation a is turned on, the low energy dynam-
ics is twisted by the tri-holomorphic vector elds. the moduli space has two tri-
holomorphic isometries kas, generated by /i, or equivalently, generated by /
and /. the relevant tri-holomorphic vector eld g can be decomposed into two
orthogonal pieces,

g = e a  k = e at




+ a



! ,

(45)

where at and a are dened as a ( + ) and a ( ), respectively. the potential
associated with / is a constant and accounts for an important contribution to the
total electric (or excitation) bps energy when an electric  +  charge is excited.
the potential associated with / is position-dependent, and leads to interesting
dyonic bound states. thus, the interaction between the two fundamental monopoles
is dictated by the low energy supersymmetric quantum mechanics on taub-nut
space, twisted by the tri-holomorphic vector eld g  ea /.
given this and the results of the previous section, to determine the bps states
with magnetic charge g = 4( + )/e we need to nd normalizable solutions to the
dirac equation

(i  g) = 0,

(46)

where  is the covariant derivative with respect to taub-nut space. this particular
problem has been solved by pope in a dierent context [14]. we can summarise
his results as follows. let  be the half-integral charge of the state  with respect
to il . the spectrum is dierent depending on the sign of a:
for negative or
vanishing a, no normalizable bound state exists; for positive a, there exists a set
of |2| normalizable states, for || < (42/e3)|a|, which form an angular momentum
||  1/2 multiplet.4
one must consider the full moduli space to construct the actual wavefunction.
the electric charges of the state are determined by momenta along  and . taking
into account the z2 identication in (44) in the case that 1 = 2, the general electric
charge is given by

q = e (k + )  + e (k  ) ,

where the  momentum k is (half-)integer whenever  is (half-)integer.

although we derived this for the special case when the masses of the two fundamental
monopoles are equal, this form is valid more generally.

the center of mass part of the moduli space also gives rise to an additional degener-
acy factor. the four free fermionic partners to ~x and  generate a half-hypermultiplet
structure of degeneracy 4. thus, for each bound state wavefunction of charge (, k), a
single bps supermultiplet of the highest spin || is formed. the degeneracy of these
supermultiplets is summarised below.

in particular, the smallest possible multiplet is the half-hyper multiplet associated
with  = 1/2 (for positive a) or  = 1/2 (for negative a). combined with the charge
conjugate states, it forms a full hypermultiplet of the n = 2 theory. we thus nd an
innite tower of hypermultiplets with electric charge given by q = e n ( + )  e ,
for a positive or negative, respectively, as a subset of the more general bps states
with electric charge (48).

in the limit of a = 0 it is known that a purely magnetic bps bound state of one 
and one  monopole does not exist. indeed such a state corresponds to a holomorphic
harmonic form on taub-nut space and its existence would have contradicted the
n = 4 s-duality prediction of a unique anti-self-dual harmonic form. here we have
found this feature persists for more general vacua when a 6= 0.

4 the restriction of bps spectrum to || < (42/e3)|a| is reminiscent of 1/4 bps dyon spectrum

in n = 4 theories [8, 9].

5 consistency with seiberg-witten theory

in section 4 we found the complete bps spectrum of dyons for magnetic charges ,
, and  + , for values of b where where the  and  monopoles are approximately
fundamental. these states include dyons in hypermultiplets and we now comment
how this subsector relates to known results about seiberg-witten theory.

the weak coupling spectrum of pure su(n) theory was studied by fraser and
hollowood by analyzing monodromy transformations on the vacuum moduli space
[16]. starting with the hypermultiplets corresponding to fundamental monopoles in
regions where only a single higgs eld is non-vanishing, the monodromy transforma-
tions predict additional hypermultiplets. for the case of su(3), the vacuum moduli
space splits into two disjoint regions separated by a curve of marginal stability. in
one region there are hypermultiplets with charge vectors (g, q) given by

(, n),
(, n),

( + , n( + )  ),

(49)

for any integer n. in the second region the states have identical charges except that
the electric charge of the third set of states have the form n( + ) + . consistency
then requires that the states with magnetic charge + decay as they cross the curve
of marginal stability. this is entirely consistent with the spectrum of hypermultiplets
that we found in section 4.

the curious asymmetry of spectrum with respect to the sign of electric charge also
manifests itself in the strong coupling behavior of of seiberg-witten vacuum moduli
space. for example, the asymmetry shows up in the charges of those bps states
that become massless at strong coupling singularities. the electromagnetic charges
of such states in pure su(3) have been initially worked out explicitly in a symplectic
basis [21], and later in terms of weight vectors [16].

let us make some additional observations concerning the singularity structure of
the su(3) theory. recall that the moduli space of vacua can be described in terms of
spectral curve of genus two, which can be written in the weierstrass form as follows
[20],

y2 =

3

yi=1

(x  i)2  6.

(50)

here the is satisfy the traceless condition pi i = 0 and the vacuum moduli space
is parameterised by the gauge-invariant combinations u  12 + 23 + 31 and
v  123.
the x plane has a set of three square-root branch cuts, which, for small uv cut-o
, are located near the is. some of the six end points of these branch cuts can meet
pairwise for special values of the is. along such hypersurfaces, a certain charged
state becomes massless and generates a singularity of complex co-dimension one on
the moduli space. with  6= 0, there are six dierent ways that this can happen in

13

terms of the i coordinates, and therefore six dierent charged states that can become
massless along such hypersurfaces. the six homology cycles of the riemann surface
have some mutual intersection numbers, which is related to the schwinger products
between the corresponding dyons. from this one can deduce that the electric and
the magnetic charges of these six dyons are given in a symplectic basis by [21],

(1, 0; 1, 0)
(0, 1;1, 1)
(1, 1; 0, 1)

(1, 0;1, 1)
(0, 1; 0,1)
(1, 1;1, 0).

(51)

here (m1, m2; n1, n2) represents a charge of the form m1b1 +m2b2 +n1a1 +n2a2 with ai
and bi a charge basis whose pairwise schwinger products are such that 2(aibj) = ij
and a1  a2 = 0 = b1  b2. this does not x the electromagnetic charges uniquely.
first of all, there are monodromies on the moduli space which must be xed by
hand. furthermore, the same intersection matrix shows up regardless of the number of
avors in the theory, which implies that there must be certain ambiguity in translating
the symplectic basis to its counterpart in the weight lattice. part of the ambiguity
is resolved by noting that near each pair of singularities that extends far out into
the asymptotic region, the local physics should resemble that of su(2). each of the
states must thus have a unit magnetic charge that corresponds to one of three positive
roots, , ,  + . finally, when we discuss theories with adjoint matter only, the
electric charges must also fall onto the root lattice, and this knowledge determines
the charges up to the monodromies.

let us choose the monodromy so that (1, 0; 1, 0) is the pure monopole with charge
(, 0) and that (0, 1; 0,1) is the pure monopole with charge (, 0). this is possible
because
(52)

(, 0)  (, 0) =   0  0   = 0.

using the above arguments, one then nds the following minimal set of charge vectors
on root lattice,

(, 0)
(,)
( + ,)

(, )
(, 0)
( + , ).

(53)

in this set of charges, we again nd the prominent feature we found in the low
energy dynamics, namely the asymmetry with respect to the sign of electric charges.
furthermore, assuming that there is no marginal stability domain wall for the last two
states in passing to asymptotic region we worked in, this also tells us that there must
be dyonic bound states of charges ( + ,) and ( + , ) in hypermultiplets,
which are exactly the lowest lying bound states found in section 4.

6 conclusions

we have presented a low energy eective dynamics that allows one to study the
weak-coupling spectrum of dyons for pure n = 2 yang-mills gauge theory for general
gauge groups in a systematic manner. for aligned higgs elds it has been known for
some time that one should study a supersymmetric quantum mechanics on the bps
monopole moduli space[1]. for generic vacua, we have argued that the supersym-
metric quantum mechanics is supplemented by a potential term constructed from the
tri-holomorphic killing vectors on the moduli space. the bps states correspond to
normalizable zero modes of a dirac operator twisted by the killing vectors. it would
be interesting to derive this dynamics directly by generalizing the arguments of [1].
we used the formalism to study the semi-classical bps spectrum for the pure
n = 2 su(3) gauge theory. the vector b, dened by the higgs vevs and by the
choice of the weyl chamber, species a basis of simple roots in the algebra. when
the magnetic charge is given by a simple root,  or , there is a tower of dyons in
hypermultiplets with parallel electric charges. a more interesting structure emerges
for magnetic charge given by  + . firstly, the electric charge vector is necessarily
not parallel to the magnetic charge and in particular, there is no purely magnetic
bps state of this charge. secondly, there is a tower of hypermultiplets with electric
charge that are consistent with previous results in seiberg-witten theory in that they
are in accord with semi-classical monodromy and strong coupling singularities. more
generally, the hypermultiplets are a special case of an innite tower of bps states
with electric charge (m, l), with either m > l or m < l, depending on the sign of the
second higgs a, with maximal spin |m  l|/2.
it would be interesting to extend these results for more general magnetic charge,
but due to the lack of understanding of the relevant su(3) monopole moduli spaces
this appears dicult. a more accessible problem would be to generalise the results
of this paper to analyse the bps spectrum for su(n) gauge group with magnetic
charge given by (1, 1, . . . , 1).

the eective lagrangian in this paper is for the case when hypermultiplets in
the n = 2 yang-mills theory can be ignored. if there are light hypermultiplets, one
must introduce new quantum mechanical degrees of freedom associated with them.
presumably, there is a way to couple them to our lagrangian while preserving the
four real supercharges. however, it goes beyond the scope of this paper, and will be
worked out elsewhere.
