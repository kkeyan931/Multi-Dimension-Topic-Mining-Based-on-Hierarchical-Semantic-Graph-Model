abstract

we would like to show that certain excitations of the f-string/d3-brane system can
be shown to obey von neumann boundary conditions by considering the born-infeld
dynamics of the f-string (viewed as a 3-brane cylindrically wrapped on an s2). in the
paper by callan and maldacena it was shown that excitations which are normal to
both the string and the 3-brane behave as if they had dirichlet boundary conditions at
the point of attachement. here we show that excitations which are coming down the
string with a polarization along a direction parallel to the brane are almost completely
reected just as in the case of all-normal excitations, but the end of the string moves
freely on the 3-brane, thus realizing polchinskis open string von neumann boundary
condition dynamically. in the low energy limit   0, i.e. for wavelengths much larger
than the string scale only a small fraction  4 of the energy escapes in the form of
dipole radiation. the physical interpretation is that a string attached to the 3-brane
manifests itself as an electric charge, and waves on the string cause the end point of the
string to freely oscillate and therefore produce e.m. dipole radiation in the asymptotic
outer region.

setup

callan and maldacena [1] showed that the born-infeld action, when taken as the fun-
damental action, can be used to build a conguration with a semi-innite fundamental
string ending on a 3-brane3, whereby the string is actually made out of the brane
wrapped on s2 (see also [2]). the relevant action can be obtained by computing a
simple born-infeld determinant, dimensionally reduced from 10 dimensions

l = 

1

(2)3gs z d4xq1  ~e2 + (~x9)2,

(1)

where gs is the string coupling ( = 1).

the above mentioned theory contains 6 scalars x4, ...., x9 , which are essentially
kaluza-klein remnants from the 10-dimensional n = 1 electrodynamics after dimen-
sional reduction to 3 + 1 dimensions. as is well known these extra components of the
e.m. eld a4, ..., a9 describe the transverse deviations of the brane x4, ..., x9.

the solution, which satises the bps conditions, is necessarily also a solution of the

linear theory, the n = 4 super-electrodynamics,

~e =

c
r2 ~er ,

~x9 =

c
r2 ~er ,

x9 = 

c
r

,

(2)

where c = gs sets the distance scale, and in what follows we drop it. here the scalar
eld represents the geometrical spike, and the electric eld insures that the string carries
uniform ns charge along it. the rr charge of the 3-brane cancels out on the string, or
rather the tube behaves as a kind of rr dipole whose magnitude can be ignored when
the tube becomes thin. also, it is seen in [1] that the innite electrostatic energy of the
point charge can be reinterpreted as being due to the innite length of the attached
string. the energy per unit length comes from the electric eld and corresponds exactly
to the fundamental string tension.

polchinski, when he introduced d-branes as objects on which strings can end, re-
quired that the string have dirichlet (xed) boundary conditions for coordinates normal
to the brane, and von neumann (free) boundary conditions for coordinate directions
parallel to the brane [5, 3, 4]. it was shown in [1] that small uctuations which are nor-
mal to both the string and the brane are mostly reected back with a phase shif t  
which indeed corresponds to dirichlet boundary condition. see also [8] and [6] for a
supergravity treatment of this problem.

in this paper we will show that p-wave excitations which are coming down the
string with a polarization along a direction parallel to the brane are almost completely

3 we choose the favorite case of the 3-brane because, rst of its non-singular behaviour in sugra,

and secondly it is suggestive of our own world which is after all 3-dimensional.

reected just as in the case of all-normal excitations, but the end of the string moves
freely on the 3-brane, thus realizing polchinskis open string von neumann boundary
condition dynamically. as we will see a superposition of excitations of the scalar x9 and
of the e.m. eld reproduces the required behaviour, e.g. reection of the geometrical
uctuation with a phase shif t  0 (von neumann boundary condition)4.

in addition we observe e.m. dipole radiation which escapes to innity from the place
where the string is attached to the 3-brane. we shall see that in the low energy limit
for wavelengths much larger than the string scale a small fraction  4
  0, i.e.
of the energy escapes to innity in the form of e.m. dipole radiation. the physical
interpretation is that a string attached to the 3-brane manifests itself as an electric
charge, and waves on the string cause the end point of the string to freely oscillate and
therefore produce e.m. dipole radiation in the asymptotic outer region of the 3-brane.
thus not only in the static case, but also in a more general dynamical situation the
above interpretation remains valid. this result provides additional support to the idea
that the electron may be understood as the end of a fundamental string ending on a
d-brane.

2 the lagrangian and the equations

let us write out the full lagrangian which contains both electric and magnetic elds,
plus the scalar x9  

l = z d4xdet ,

where det = 1 + ~b2  ~e2  ( ~e  ~b)2  (0)2(1 + ~b2) + (~)2
+( ~b  ~)2  ( ~e  ~)2 + 20( ~b[~  ~e])

we will proceed by adding a uctuation to the background values (2) :

~e = ~e0 +  ~e,

~b =  ~b,  = 0 +  .

then keeping only terms in the det which are linear and quadratic in the uctuation
we will get

det =  ~b2   ~e2  ( ~e0 ~b)2  (0)2 + (~)2
+( ~b~)2  ( ~e0  ~)2  ( ~e  ~)2  2( ~e0  ~)( ~e  ~)
2( ~e0 ~e) + 2(~~)

4 this problem was also considered in [6] where the e.m. eld is integrated out to produce an
eective lagrangian for the scalar eld only. the other essensial dierence with us is that we consider
p -wave modes of the scalar eld which describe physical transverse uctuations of the f-string and
not the s-wave modes which do not correspond to physical excitations of the string.

note that one should keep the last two linear terms because they produce additional
quadratic terms after taking the square root. these terms involve the longitudinal
polarization of the e.m. eld and cancel out at quadratic order. the resulting quadratic
lagrangian is

) + ~e0

(~   ~e) .

let us introduce the gauge potential for the uctuation part of the e.m. eld as (a0, ~a)
and substitute the values of the background elds from (2)

2lq = (0 ~a~a0)2(1+
the equations that follow from this lagrangian contain dynamical equations for the
vector potential and for the scalar eld, and a separate equation which represents a
constraint. these equations in the lorenz gauge ~ ~a = 0a0 are

equation () is a constraint: the time derivative of the lhs is zero, as can be shown
using the equation of motion ().

let us choose a0 = . this condition can be viewed as (an attempt to) preserve
the bps relation which holds for the background: ~e = ~. another point of view is
that this xes the general coordinate invariance which is inherent in the born-infeld
lagrangian in such a way as to make the given perturbation to be normal to the surface.
of course transversality is insured automatically but this choice makes it explicite. the
general treatment of this subject can be found in [7].

with this condition the equations () and () become the same, and the rst equa-

tion is also simplied:

~a(1 +

r4 ) +  ~a = 0 ,

r4 0 ~a = 0 .

(7)

(8)

this should be understood to imply that once we obtain a solution, a0 is determined
from , but in addition we are now obliged to respect the gauge condition which goes
over to ~ ~a = 0.

in order that all points on the s2 section of the tube ( which is schematically

3 von neumann boundary conditions and dipole

we will seek for a solution with denite energy (frequency w) in the following form: ~a
should have only one component az, and  be an l = 1 spherical p -wave

with the gauge condition becoming r = i. it can be seen again, that the second
equation follows from the rst by dierentiation. this is because the former coincides
with the constraint in our anzatz.

therefore the problem is reduced to nding the solution of a single scalar equation,
and determining the other elds through subsidiary conditions. the equation itself
surprisingly turned out to be the one familiar from [1] for the transverse uctuations.

along the surface of the brane

and a new wavefunction

this coordinate behaves as   r in the outer region (r  ) and   1/r on the
string (r  0). the exact symmetry of the equation r  1/r goes over to   .
the equation, when written in this coordinate becomes just the free wave equation,
plus a narrow symmetric potential at   0

the asymptotic wave functions can be constructed as plain waves in ,

(r) = (1 + r4)1/4ei(r) ,

or in the various limits:

r  0

ei(r) .

these formulae give us the asymptotic wave function in the regions   , while
around  = 0 (r = 1) there is a symmetric repulsive potential which drops very fast
 1/6 on either side of the origin. the scattering is described by a single dimensionless
parameter c, and in the limit of small  and/or coupling c = gs the potential
becomes narrow and high, and can be replaced by a -function with an equivalent area
 1
under the curve. therefore the scattering matrix becomes almost independent
gs
of the exact form of the potential. the end result is that most of the amplitude is
reected back with a phase shift close to , thus dynamically realizing the dirichlet
boundary condition in the low energy limit.

in order to obtain  (and ) we need to dierentiate  with respect to r:

figure 2: the gure 2a depicts the scattering of the  wave. note the discontinuity
in the derivative which is proportional to 1/. figure 2b shows the scattering of the
 wave. being the derivative of , it results in a discontinuity of the function itself,
making it into a cosine, which means free (von neumann) boundary condition at  = 0.

this brings about several consequences for . firstly, it causes  to grow as  1/r2
as r  0. this is the correct behaviour because when converted to displacement in
the z direction, it means constant amplitude. secondly, the i that enters causes the
superposition of the incoming and reected waves to become a cosine from a sine, as
is the case for  waves. this corresponds to a 0 phase shift and implies von neumann
boundary condition for the  wave (fig 2).

because of the  factor in the gauge condition we need to be careful about normal-
izations, thus we shall choose to x the amplitude of the  wave to be independent of
. then the magnitude of the e.m. eld in the inner region becomes independent of
 as well. combined with the transmission factor, proportional to c, this gives the
correct dependence of the total power emitted by an oscillating charge  4g2
s.

in conclusion, we need to analyze the outgoing scalar wave. this wave has both real
and imaginary parts, the former is from dierentiating the phase, while the latter is
from the prefactor. the imaginary part is  1/r2 which drops faster than radiation.
the real part does contribute to the radiation at spatial innity, as can be shown from
the integral of the energy density r (r)2dr  r 4/r2  4r2dr. this is not altogether

surprising, as we are dealing with a supersymmetric theory where the dierent elds
are tied together. thus the observer at spatial innity will see both an electromagnetic
dipole radiation eld and a scalar wave.

the problem of longitudinal uctuations was treated in [6], though not in a com-
pletely satisfactory way. there the scalar eld was taken to be an s-wave, which as
should be apparent from fig 1b, does not correspond to the string oscillating as a

6

whole. in addition the electromagnetic eld was eectively integrated out, thus one
cannot obtain the dipole radiation at spatial innity.
