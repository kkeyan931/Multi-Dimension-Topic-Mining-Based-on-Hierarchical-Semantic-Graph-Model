(the 10d massive iia theory refers 10d iia string theory nonzero rr 10-form eld strength{$9510017$} eld theory limit, 10d massive iia supergravity{$9601150$}.) due fact massive iia supergravity cosmological term composed mass parameter m. since no-go theorem 11d supergravity forbids cosmological term{$9704131$}, term (and hence mass) cannot derived 11d supergravity via dimensional reduction. mass dual eld strength rr 9-form potential d-8-brane couples. so, 11d origin d-8-brane also unclear, although conjectured m-9-brane studies m-theory superalgebra{$9705162$}{$9712004$} (see also ref.{$9601150$}). attempts made{$9503124$}{$9503124$}{$9503124$}, one massive 11-dimensional (11d) theory proposed bergshoe, lozano, ortin{$9503124$}{$9503124$}. investigate massive theory paper. first, give brief review massive 11d theory. theory, target-space elds required killing isometry (whose direction parameterized z). eld theory, called massive 11d supergravity{$9503124$}, gives bosonic part 10d massive iia one upon dimensional reduction z. though bosonic theory, called supergravity since reproduces bosonic part ordinary 11d supergravity massless limit (and dependence elds z restored). target- space solutions m-9-branes also obtained{$9503124$}, give d-8-brane solutions{$9503124$}{$9601150$} dimensionally reduced z. addition, worldvolume actions m-branes supergravity background also examined. cases m-wave, m-2-brane, m-5-brane m-kaluza-klein monopole, full worldvolume actions obtained gauged sigma models{$9503124$}{$9503124$}. actions also give 10d massive iia branes suggested 10d iia superalgebra upon direct double dimensional reduction. (wz) action constructed yet, although kinetic term action constructed {$9503124$}{$9503124$}. case m-9-brane, however, wess-zumino furthermore, actions branes predicted iia superalgebra also obtained{$9503124$}{$9503124$}. considered m-9-brane cannot singled 11 uncompactied dimensions, singled one compact dimension{$9503124$}. based discussion m-9-brane tension scales radius 11th compact dimension{$9503124$}, action approach describes 2 main purpose paper construct wz action m-9-brane massive 11d supergravity background, since wz actions branes also play important roles investigating properties branes dualities (e.g. see recent paper {$9503124$}). purpose, 10-form gauge potential needed{$9705162$} since p-brane naturally couples (p+1)-form potential. so, specically, introduce 10-form potential massive 11d supergravity construct m-9-brane wz action using 10-form. introducing 10-form potential, follow case 9-form gauge potential 10d massive iia supergravity. two methods introduce 9-form: rst one promote mass parameter scalar eld m(x) introduce 9-form potential lagrange multiplier constraint dm(x) = 0{$9601150$}. (we denote 9-form a(9).) second one superspace formulation basis eld variables rr (p+1)-form inspired coupling d-p-branes{$9503124$}{$9501068$}. case gauge transformations eld strengths dual rr gauge elds suggested basis rr gauge elds dealt geometrically uniform way, consistency checked discussing t-dualities{$9501068$}. eld strength 9-form potential dened dual mass parameter m. (we denote 9-form c (9).) paper choose rst one introduce 10-form potential 11d theory. reason choice follows: rst method massive gauge transformation 10-form potential automatically determined. hand, one applies second method 11d case, one construct hand massive gauge transformation eld strength 10-form consistently, seems dicult since geometric uniformity t-duality symmetry massive 11d case. however, gauge invariant m-9-brane wz action cannot constructed using 10-form least straightforwardly. fact also case d-8-brane wz action sw z d8 9-form a(9) 10d iia theory, 9-form used construct c (9). (that is, eld redenition relating two 9-forms found.) sw z d8 so, rst all, explore way construct sw z terms a(9). result, d8 show gauge invariant d-8-brane wz action constructed terms a(9) duality relations appropriately used (to concrete, rewriting expression massive gauge transformation a(9)). so, based lesson, repeat procedures massive 11d theory: discuss eld strengths gauge elds duals assume duality relations, based transformations properties relations 10d iia elds. then, use relations appropriately rewrite m-9-brane wrapped around compact isometry direction. requirement -symmetry d-brane actions shown imply eld equations massive iia supergravity{$9503124$}{$9501068$}. detailed discussions given section 2. 3 massive gauge transformation a(10). finally, construct gauge invariant m-9-brane wz action gives d-8-brane wz action dimensional reduction along z. moreover, paper another purpose: reconstruct target-space solution single m-9-brane given ref.{$9503124$}. two points improved: rst one solve equations motion (of massive 11d supergravity) source terms, comes obtained wz action well kinetic action m-9-brane. source terms taken account ref.{$9503124$}, must considered since m-9-brane regarded roughly electric object terms 10-form gauge eld. second one construct m-9-brane solution nontrivial conguration 10-form potential. solutions ref.{$9503124$} obtained solutions pure gravity (i.e. metric eld nontrivial). however, seems unnatural usual p-brane solutions obtained nontrivial (p+1)-form gauge potentials. concrete, make certain ansatz, including one done ref.{$9503124$}, solve equations motion source terms. organization paper follows: section 2 discuss case 9-form 10d massive iia supergravity. rst give review it, exhibit problem resolution stated explicitly. section 3, short review massive 11d supergravity, introduce 10-form gauge potential. then, discuss duality relations, use appropriately construct m-9-brane wz action. section 4 solve equations motion source terms present m-9-brane solution nontrivial 10-form potential. section 5 give short summary discussion. appendix, give relations 11d 10d elds. 2 9-form potential 10d massive iia theory section begin brief review 10d massive iia supergravity{$9601150$}. eld content massless one: {g, b, , c (1) }.k (innitesi- mal) massive gauge transformations dened , c (3) b = 2, c (1) = m, c (3) = 3mb (2.1) 1-form gauge parameter constant mass parameter. gauge invariant eld strengths h (3) = 3, g(2) = 2 + mb, ] 12 + 3mb. (2.2) bosonic action massive iia supergravity s0 = 1 n z d10x (2.3) totally antisymmetric symbol (0129 = 1). bosonic action 10d massless iia supergravity found taking limit 0. one way introduce 9-form gauge potential promote mass parameter scalar eld m(x), add term = 1 n z d10x 16g(10) 1 10! 110m(x)10 (2.4) action s0{$9601150$}. then, eld equation a(9) implies scalar eld m(x) constant m, so, eliminating a(9) leads eld equations original massive iia supergravity. procedure, m(x) eld equation = { 10 10! a(9) + 1 288 c (3)b3 + 9 144 40 b5}110 g(2)b 1 8 g(4)bb, (2.5) 110 q|g| 1 2 implying 10-form eld strength f (10) = 10a(9) regarded variable canonically conjugate m. moment, original action s0 longer invariant transformations (2.1). instead, s0 proportional m, s0 = 16g(10) 110 1 n z d10xq|g|.

(2.7) discussed ref.{$9503124$}, sign cosmological constant determined t-duality. strictly speaking, (x) piecewise constant. discuss point section 4. 5 so, concluded 9-form potential introduced consistently. note rst two terms (2.7) cannot expressed exterior products forms. now, discuss construction d-8-brane wz action sw z d8 . want d8 using 9-form a(9). however, cannot achieved construct sw z least straightforwardly. concrete, since d-8-brane couples 9-form potential, sw z d8 contains term sw z d8 |9form part = 9!z d9 i1i9i1x 1 i9x 9a(9) 19 (2.8) (i = 0, .., 8) worldvolume coordinates brane x ( = 0, .., 9) embedding coordinates. suppose consider massive gauge transformation (2.8). then, see contribution rst two terms (2.7) variation d8 |9form part cannot cancelled even terms added sw z sw z d8 |9form part. implies one cannot keep massive gauge symmetry brane action a(9) used straightforwardly. idea resolve problem simple: one rewrite rst two terms (2.7) using dual elds c (1) c (3) duality relations, two terms expressed sum exterior products forms. so, expected gauge invariant wz action constructed. idea success, show following: dual elds c (3) c (1) 5-form c (5) 7-form c (7), respectively. use duals dened ref.{$9501068$}, whose eld strengths massive gauge transformations given respectively ( g(6) g(8) 16 = (6c (5) 60bc (3) + 15mb3){$9503124$}, 18 = (8c (7) 168bc (5) + 105mb4){$9503124$}, ( c (5) c (7) 15 = 15(b2){$9503124$}, 17 = 105(b3){$9503124$}. duality relations (in notation) are{$9501068$} g(2)12 = 110 8!q|g| g(8) 310, g(4)14 = 110 6!q|g| g(6) 510. (2.9) substituting relations rst two terms (2.7) leads rewritten expression a(9) 19 = 9!{$9503124$}.(2.10) using expression, obtain wz action invariant massive gauge transformations. means via eld redenition, a(9) related 9-form potential c (9) usually used constructing sw z d8 . so, instead giving action procedure, eld strengths rr gauge elds also invariant massive gauge transformations due promotion (x). however, causes problem one replace time (x) constant solving a(9) eld equation. 6 terms a(9), present redenition relation. eld strength c (9) dened case as{$9501068$} = g(10) = 110 10!q|g| 10110. (2.11) substituting (2.9) last two terms (2.5) comparing (2.11), determine relation two 9-forms total derivative c (9) 19 = {a(9) + 9!( 1 2 7! c (7)b 1 23 5! c (5)b2 + 1 23(3!)2 c (3)b3)}{$9503124$}. (2.12) redenition relation consistent massive gauge transformations two, (i.e. (2.10) c (9) d8 constructed via a(9). thus, conclude using duality relations crucial derive wz action terms 9-form a(9). 19 = 945m(b4){$9503124$}). so, sw z 3 10-form gauge potential m-9-brane wess- zumino action massive 11d supergravity section rst review massive 11d supergravity{$9503124$}. bosonic eld content supergravity usual (massless) 11d supergravity: metric g 3-form gauge potential c. theory elds required c = 0 lk indicates lie derivative killing isometry, i.e., lkg = lk respect killing vector eld k.
