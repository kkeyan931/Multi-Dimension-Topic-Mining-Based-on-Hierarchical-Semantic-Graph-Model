in the present paper we calculate the statistical partition function for any number of extended
objects in matrix theory in the one loop approximation. as an to application, we calculate the
statistical properties of k clusters of d0 branes and then the statistical properties of k membranes
which are wound on a torus .

i. introduction

matrix theory [1] is one of the most promising ideas for a nonperturbative denition of m theory. there are many
hints that conrms the validity of this conjecture, for example, this theory can reproduce the leading order scattering
amplitude for gravitons in eleven dimensional low energy supergravity without momentum transfer in the longitudinal
direction (for example [24]). we also have a good knowledge of what happens when one compacties this theory on
a p dimensional torus for p < 6. [59] this theory also reproduces all ve string theories [1014]

on the other hand, there are many unresolved problems. eleven dimensional lorenz invariance is still mysterious,
the theory is dened in a xed background. processes with longitudinal momentum transfer between gravitons has
not been calculated and this process would be rather useful for proving lorenz invariance. the other serious problem
is that matrix theory is not well understood for more complicated backgrounds (for example the p-torus with p > 6).
one of the most interesting problems where matrix theory can be tested is the quantum mechanical description
of black holes. this is because matrix theory, as a candidate for a nonperturbative denition of m theory, must be
able to describe these black holes and indeed this have been done in many papers (for example [15], [24]). in these
approaches, a remarkably simple model for schwarzschild black holes was presented in that the schwarzschild black
hole is described as a collection of n d0 branes, and the basic properties of these black holes comes from a statistical
study of this system. in this approach it is important to have these branes distinguishable in order to obtain the
correct formula for the entropy. in order to obtain distinguishable d0 branes, we must specify some background,
which completely breaks the residual symmetry of the matrix model, which is the group of permutation of n objects
sn . more precisely, when we take the matrix theory lagrangian, which describes a system of n d0 branes, this is
0+1 sym theory with gauge group u(n). if we want to describe the sector of the theory with n well separated d0
branes, then we must break the gauge group into u (1)n , but the conguration is still invariant under the group of
permutations sn which results in the quantum statistic properties of gravitons (more in [16]), but when we specify
some classical background, this completely breaks the residual symmetry and we obtain a system of n distinguishable
particles [15].

in [15], schwarzschild black holes were studied in the regime s  n , which simply means that the black hole
consists of n distinguishable particles which each carry a longitudinal momentum p = 1/r, where r is the radius
of the longitudinal direction in the dlcq quantization of m theory.

an interesting proposal was made in [18], where the statistical properties of schwarzschild black holes were obtained
from rst principles in matrix theory. because, as the authors argued, since matrix theory is a candidate for a
nonperturbative description of m theory, it has to be possible to determine from rst principles the properties of
all gravitational objects included in this regime. in their paper, the thermodynamic properties were calculated from
the statistical partition function of matrix theory for a particular sector of this theory. the background was chosen
to describe a collection of n classical d0 branes and then they calculated the partition function by integrating out
o diagonal modes. subsequently they estimated the basic thermodynamic properties of this system by the same
procedure as was used in [15] for estimating mean values of characteristic parameters. after this was done, they
obtained the same relation between entropy, mass and schwarzschild radius for black hole as in classical gravity and
as in the work [15] without the initial assumption that s  n . in the conclusions of [18], they suggested a similar
way to count the properties of schwarzschild black hole also in the regime s << n and they furthermore suggested
that in this regime the d0 branes can form membrane-like degrees of freedom.

the regime s << n was previously investigated in the paper [24] and there it was proposed that the d0 branes would
condense into k clusters, where k  s. in this situation these clusters must also exchange longitudinal momentum
among themselves and this interaction must also be included into the eective potential between these clusters (as
usual in matrix theory, it is dicult to calculate this potential directly, so the potential has to be estimated). doing
this they were able to obtain the correct value for the entropy and the mass of a schwarzschild black hole in the
regime s << n .

in the present paper we will calculate the macroscopic properties of schwarzschild black holes precisely in this
regime s << n in a way similar to the one suggested in [18], so this paper should be seen as a continuation of
[18]. the generalization consists in taking more complicated backgrounds with more than two objects (there are k
extended objects), which are far away from each other. we take a background consisting of k clusters of d0 branes
where the longitudinal momentum of the i-th cluster is p = ni/r. we will compute the statistical sum, and after
estimating the mean values of velocity of each object, the distance between the objects and other parameters according
to [15], we obtain a value for the entropy s  k. this had to be assumed in [24], but here it emerges directly from
theory. however, we cannot obtain directly from this approach the correct macroscopic quantities (mass, entropy,
schwarzschild radius) for black holes due to the fact that when we count the one loop statistical partition function, we
obtain an eective potential which does not include exchange of longitudinal momentum between clusters. when we
estimate this potential in the same way as in [24] we obtain correct value of mass, entropy and schwarzschild radius

1

for a schwarzschild black hole. certainly it would be interesting to obtain this potential directly from matrix theory,
but we do not know how this could be done.

we also have to worry about the fact that membranes in matrix theory are not stable objects unless they are
innite or wound around some non-trivial cycles. the innite membranes are not good to construct nite size black
holes from but we will show that the stable compact membranes wound on non-trivial cycles, which are described by
a 3 + 1 dimensional sys theory, can be used to show that the same statements hold for schwarzschild black holes in
eight dimensions.

this paper is organized as follows. in the rst part we choose a general background and expand the action for
matrix theory around it giving us the action for the uctuating elds. in the second part we evaluate the partition
function to one loop order. in the third part we use our general partition function for a particular example. namely,
we consider k clusters of d0 branes and we will try to evaluate the characteristic macroscopic properties of a collection
of these clusters in order to conrm the conjecture [24] that schwarzschild black hole in the regime s << n can
be described as a collection of k clusters. in the fourth part we calculate this partition function for matrix theory
compactied on a three torus and as a particular example we take a collection of k membranes wound around two
compact directions and again we obtain the correct formula for entropy and mass of a schwarzschild black hole.

ii. general background in matrix theory

we start with the standard action in dlcq m theory, which is 0+1 sym with gauge group u (n )

where  = 1
r , g = m 3r with m being the plank mass and r being the radius of the compact light-like circle. also,
n are so(9) gamma matrices in the majorana representation, so they are real, symmetric and obey the relation
{m, n} = 2mn, and  is thus a real 16 component spinor. our elds also transform in the adjoint representation
of the gauge group u(n) so all matrices must be hermitian.

in order to evaluate the partition function, we must go to euclidean time, so we make the transformation

after this transformation we obtain the euclidean form of the action

we would like to evaluate the partition function, which is dened as

z() =z [path] exp(z

(4)

(5)

this function can be evaluated in two steps. to begin with we specify some background which is described by a
classical conguration in matrix theory and we evaluate the eective action about this background. then, following
[15], we estimate various mean values appropriate for a background describing a schwarzschild black hole in eleven
dimensions and insert them in the action to nd the quantities we are interested in. after the evaluation, we nd
that this model do not completely describe a schwarzschild black hole for n >> s and then we explain why it is so.
we begin by computing the 1 loop eective action for an arbitrary background. to this end we divide the eld

from (4) into two parts:

2

x i =

1
g

bi + y i

(6)

where x i is the classical background and y i is a quantum uctuation. we take background values of fermionic elds
and ghosts elds to be zero. because our lagrangian is the lagrangian of sym theory, it is gauge invariant and we
need to x the gauge to make the calculation. we will use a gauge xing of the form

which means that we will also have ghosts present in the lagrangian. after expanding the action around the back-
ground we obtain the following lagrangian (in the following, partial derivative means derivative with respect to
euclidean time  ):

  a + i[bn, y n] = 0,

where the ghost eld c , c are two real and independent fermionic elds in the adjoint representation of the gauge

and the same matrix for c, where the matrices c are replaced with c. these matrices with indexes m, n have the
same number of rows and columns as the matrix ym n .

this form of the matrices of the uctuating elds is appropriate for evaluating the one loop eective action because
the diagonal uctuating elds decouple in the expansion of the lagrangian at the quadratic level. inserting these
matrices in the lagrangian and after straightforward but tedious algebra we obtain the following lagrangian for the
uctuating elds:

is a matrix of order nm  nn , which means that i = 1 . . . nm , j = 1 . . . nn and the index a goes from 0 . . . 9 where

iii. evaluation of the effective action

in the following we would like to calculate the one loop eective action. because this subject is well known in the
literature [2022], we only briey recapitulate basic facts. firstly, because our eective action is a thermal eective
action, we must specify boundary condition in the thermal direction for various elds which are in the action. we
have:

(0) = ()

4

(23)

where the upper sign is for the bosons (y i) and the lower one for the fermions (  , c, c ). we use these formulas for
evaluating some integrals:

z [y ][y ] exp((y a)m aby b) = det(m )1 (for bosons)

z [c][c ] exp(c n c) = det(n )

(for fermions)

so

where

exp (1) =

k

ym <n,n =1

(xy z)m n

1

xm n = det(2 + mm n )
2
ym n = det(2 + k 2
m n )
m n )1
zm n = det(  nk n

(24)

(25)

(26)

in these traces we must sum over matrix indices, lorenz indices or spinor indices and we must integrate over  with
appropriate boundary condition. also, the ghost determinant has exponent 2, because we have two equivalent ghosts
elds.

as was explained in [19], the leading order eective action can be obtain in an adiabatic approximation

det(2 + ( )2)  exp (z 

0

(t)dt)

(27)

we must convert the determinant for fermions into a determinant which is second order in time derivatives. this can
be done by using the fact that det( + nk n) = det(  nk n), which gives us

f 2 = det(  jk j) det( + ik i) = det(2 

1
2

[k i, k j]ij)

where ij = 1

2 [i, j].

from this adiabatic approximation we obtain

k

1 =  ln (

ym <n,n =1

(bgf )m n ) =

m n = k 2(t)m n

(28)

(29)

(30)

in this trace we must sum over spinor or lorenzian indices and the trace in the matrices mm n ij is over the i, j indices.
now we must evaluate this eective action. this will be done following [21]. we must divide, the various (t) into

5

two parts, the rst part which scales as a function of distance between two long separate object and the rest. this
can be done in the following way; for bosons:

(t)ab2

m n = m0
m (t)ab

ab
m n + m1

ab
m n

0m n = k(t)2

m n ab, m (t)ab

1m n = 2if ab

m n

for fermions:

(t)2

m n = m (t)0m n + m (t)1m n

m (t)0m n = k(t)2

m n  11616, m (t)1m n = k(t)n

m n n 

1
2

m n ij

we must go over to the proper time representation :

exp( (m(t)0 + m(t)1))

(31)

(32)

(33)

the integral can now be evaluated by the help of a dyson perturbative series. because we know, that m1 is much
smaller than m0, we can take the latter as a perturbative term, and the former as a background around which we
expand. it corresponds to the standard dyson formula free hamiltonian. we take (in the following we will not write
out the dependence of these terms on t, because in the proper time representation these terms are constant. we also
will not write various indices, because these are not important in what follows)

v (s) = u (s)0u (s) ,

u (s) = exps(m0+n1), u (s)0 = expsm0

(35)

(36)

(37)

where in evaluating we divide the trace into two parts, one over the lorenz indices and the other over the matrix
indices. in the following we will not write indices of type m n , because as we can see from (29), the eective action is
linear in indexes m, n so that we can simply calculate for one matrix with index m n and then sum over m, n . we
see that to zeroth order these contributions are zero. to rst order, we have contributions from boson and fermion
respectively:

trlm(s)1b  trlm(s)1f = 2ifaa + kntrn 

i
2

fij  trij = 0

this is due to the basic properties of the gamma matrices ( trn = 0 ) and the antisymmetry of tensor f ab.

to second order, we obtain the following term in the eective action:

the bosonic term has the form:

(38)

(39)

and the fermionic term has the form:

trl(m(s1)1m(s2)1) = 8 k(s1) k(s2)  4fij(s1)fij(s2)

trl(m(s1)1m(s2)2) =

1
4

f ij (s1)f kl(s2)tr(ijkl) =
= 16 k(s1) k(s2)  8f ij(s1)f ji(s2)

so fermionic and bosonic contribution cancel each other. to third order we obtain:

which for bosons means:

and for fermions:

trl (m(s1)1m(s2)1m(s3)1) =

trl (m(s1)1m(s2)1m(s3)1) = trl(cid:18) knn

where the trace is now over spinor indices. after some algebra we obtain the following result for the fermions:

(45)

=(cid:16)16if ijf jkf ki  16i k if ij k j  16if ij k i k j + 16if ijf jkf ki(cid:17) (s1)(s2)(s3)

so again, to third order, fermionic and bosonic term cancel each other. the rst nontrivial term we obtain at fourth
order, so when we take the leading terms of m1(s), which is independent of s, we obtain the following result

trl boson (m(s1)1m(s2)1m(s3)1m(s4)1)mn

trl fermi (m(s1)1m(s2)1m(s3)1m(s4)1)mn =

96foifojfikfkj + 24fijfjkfklfli  6fijfij fklfkl)

(46)

where str, meaning the symmetric trace, is dened as an average over all ordering in indices ij and to leading order
we may replace m0 in the exponential function in our dyson series by the term rm n so after a simple integration,
and because the trace is independent to leading order in s we obtain the nal form for the eective potential:

this is the nal result, which can be used for studying the thermodynamic properties of schwarzschild black holes.

iv. schwarzschild black holes

we will follow [15] in supposing that we have some bound state corresponding to some classical object in matrix
theory which move in any bounded region in space time and then we will try to evaluate the thermodynamic charac-
teristics of this system. we will take our background in the form of k clusters of d0 branes which are far away from
each other and we will suppose that their quantum mechanical properties are not important for obtaining the leading
order result. so we will take the background in the following form:

x m =


(vm

1  + rm
1 )  1n1n1
0
0

(vm

0
2  + rm
2 )  1n2n2
. . .

0
k )  1nk nk




(48)

i describes position of the cluster in time  = 0 and where vm
i

where rm
is the velocity of the cluster and m = 1 . . . 9.
by choosing a background of this form we do not care about the proper structure of the bound state (cluster) of these
particles. inserting these background matrices into the eective action we obtain:

now we must make a scale transformation, because this eective action has been evaluated for background matrices
bn and these are related to the physical coordinates and physical velocities through the following transformations:

bi = gx i, g = m 3

p r, v  gv, 1

now we would like to evaluate some thermodynamic properties for this ensemble. we will suppose that these clusters
live in some bounded region in space-time and that the radius of this region is rs. since these clusters must live in
this region, their thermal average value must obey the following conditions:

where  is the inverse temperature of the black hole. the cluster must obey the heisenberg uncertainty principle,
which in our situation says

h|rm n|i  h|vm n|i   h|vm|i   rs

(53)

because the momentum of the cluster (as can be derived from the lagrangian, using noethers theorem, since our
lagrangian is invariant under translation) is

hnmi

r h|vm|i rs  1

(54)

we can also suppose that all clusters have on the average the same value of longitudinal momentum p, which tells
us that

p i

m =

(56)

when we combine all these facts, we obtain following average values:

now, since these average values have been estimated, we can start to count the statistical properties of this ensemble.
we have

when we apply our average values, we obtain

inserting our average values into the previous term, we obtain the entropy in the following form

so our result conrms the conjecture of [24], that schwarzschild black holes in region s << n can be described as a
bound state of k clusters, but this is not the end of the story.

when we insert (64) into (60) we obtain

(67)

which certainly is not the correct result, since mass is a function of the number n , but mass is a macroscopic quantity
which cannot depend on microscopic parameters. the reason why we cannot obtain a correct result lies in our
ignorance of the process of longitudinal momentum exchange. but this is dicult problem in matrix theory, which
cannot be resolved with our simple result. but if we follow [24] and estimate the interaction term in the way that
was used in that paper we obtain

which is the correct result for the schwarzschild radius as a function of the mass of the black hole. finally, we will
determine the temperature of the schwarzschild black hole. to begin with we write the transformation rule in dlcq
for a transformation in the longitudinal direction:

which means, that these two quantities scale with relatively inverse coecient under this transformation. and because
temperature transforms as an energy, we have:

[m+, p+] = ip+, [m+, p] = ip

v. objects in matrix theory on a torus

so far we have described only at eleven dimensional matrix theory and general conguration matrix objects in
this theory. we would like to conrm the conjecture of [18], that the schwarzschild black hole in the regime s << n
can be described as a collection of s membranes. however, there is a problem. the previous eective action is
certainly valid formally, but cannot describe extended objects in matrix theory for nite n. this is because these
objects are described by commutator f ij = i[k i, k j] terms, of which the trace is certainly zero for nite matrices.
these extended objects should therefore be described by innite matrices, but this is not the end of the story. even
classically, membranes are stable only if they are innite, or if they are living on some compact manifold. finite
membranes in at space-time will eventually collapse into a point in the classical case, but when their size will be of
the order of the planck scale, the quantum mechanical properties will be important so then we must study the whole
system as a quantum mechanical system which is described by a special 0 + 1 sym with gauge group u (n ) and this is
a rather dicult problem. on the other hand, classical innite membranes cannot serve as a model for schwarzschild
black hole. in order to describe a statistical ensemble of stable extended objects (for example membranes), we must
take these extended objects as being innite or we must wind them on some compact dimension. in order to describe a
membrane, which is nite, we must take matrix theory on a compact manifold, and the simplest way is to compactify
matrix theory on a p-torus, which by the standard prescription [23] is the same as sym on the dual p-torus. in the
following we will study membranes which are wound over a 3-torus so matrix theory is described by 3+1 sym with
gauge group u (n ), for a system with total longitudinal momentum p = n
r . the bosonic part of this lagrangian
has the form:

l =

1

g2 z dp xtr(

1
4

f f +

(d)2

2

+ [i, j]2)

(77)

where the integration is over the dual 3 torus of size (for simplicity all compact dimensions have the same size)
2l3
p
rl . here r is the radius of the longitudinal direction and l is the radius of the compact dimension of the
 =
original torus. greek indices run over 0 . . . 3 and over i, j = 4 . . . 9. in the yang-mills theory, the coupling constant is

g2 =

l3
p
l3 .

(78)

we would like to show how the action for the membrane arise from the previous lagrangian since the generalization for
more membranes is straightforward. (it simply consists in breaking gauge group u (n ) into u (n1)u (n2). . . u (nk),
where each subgroup describes one particular membrane.)
we would like to describe a membrane moving in the fourth direction, and which is wound in the rst and second
direction. in order to describe this membrane we take a classical background in the following way. we suppose that

 are position independent and that there are no wilson linesh adx = 0. then the kinetic term for the scalar eld

reduces to the form

1
g2

v 2

where v is the volume of the dual torus which is related to the volume of the original torus v through the standard
l9
p(2)3
form v =
r3v . we must also relate this scalar eld with the physical momentum of the membrane in the fourth
direction. this also means that the only nonzero eld is 4, all the others are zero. we take this eld to be of the
form :

i = k i  1n n

(79)

the unknown constant k can be determined from this condition. the action with (77) is invariant under the
transformation:

where bi is an arbitrary constant. this invariance is nothing but poincare translation symmetry in the transversal
space. by using standard noether methods we obtain conserved quantities which are just the moment in the transverse
dimensions:

i = i + bi  1n n


(80)

p i =

1

g2 z tr idx =

1
g2

vtr i

11

(81)

and nally, when we insert our background ansatz (79) into (81) and using (78), we obtain

kn l3l9

p =

p(2)3

pr3l3  k = p(cid:18) r

p(2)3(cid:19)2 1

l3

l3

p

as a check, we may insert (79) into the hamiltonian, which has the form

and if we for the moment leave out the gauge eld term, we obtain

h =

1

g2 z tr(

ff +

1
2

h =

1
g2 tr 2 v =

p2r
n

=

p2
p

(82)

(83)

(84)

which is the correct result.

in order to describe a membrane, we must also have a non-vanishing value of magnetic ux and when the membrane

is wound on the rst and second direction, this ux is

where the integral is over the rst and second dimension and n is an integer. again, when our background conguration
is independent of the space coordinates, we obtain the following value for f12

1

2 z trf12dx1dx2 = n

(85)

f12 =

n
n

2
2 =

n
n

r2l2

and when we insert the previous result into (83), we obtain

v =

l4
l6
p

=

(86)

(87)

from which we obtain the correct mass of a membrane which is n times wound around the rst and second direction.

now when we take the background in the following form:

m =

l2n
l3
p

f 1  1n1n1

0

f12 =

f 2  1n2n2

where we have

and insert it into the eective action, we obtain the eective action for k membranes in the form:

0 =

2m 2
i
2pi

)

k

xi=1

12

(88)

(89)

(90)

(91)

(92)

we express this eective action in momentum variables because this is more appropriate for compactication (we
can take the momentum to be nite), but from (88) we see that in the limit l  0, mass goes to zero, so that the
membrane looks like it lives in a non-compact dimension as a d0 brane.
now we may start to analyze the eective potential between the k membranes described by the previous background.

this potential was obtained in a previous work [20], which in our case, 3 + 1 sy m , takes the form:

1 = 

k

xm <n,n =1

a
r4

m n z 

0

dxstr(fmn)

(93)

where the minus sign is due to the fact that we are calculating the nite temperature eective potential which means
that we are working in euclidean signature and

fm n = (24foifoifojfoj  24foifoifjkfjk
96foifojfikfkj + 24fijfjkfklfli
6fijfijfklfkl)m n

for our background we obtain these nonzero terms

f12m n = f12m  1n n + 1m m  f t
f04m n = 4m  1n n  1m m  4n

12n

when we insert this background into (93) and using

tr (am  anbm  bn . . .) = tr (ambm . . .) tr (anbn . . .)

(94)

(95)

(96)

and using the fact that for a commuting background (such as in our case) str is the same as an ordinary trace, we
obtain

1 =

l3 , and the meaning of the other
where a is a numerical constant, which is not important for our purposes g8 =
symbols was explained in the previous part where we considered one simple membrane. again we see that in the limit
l  0 the last term in the eective potential is zero, so again this eective action reduces to the eective action of
k d0 branes in eight dimensions:

(98)

we see that again this conguration describe an ensemble of k d0 particles, so that the analysis will be the same as
in the previous case or as in [24], so that we will not repeat this analysis there.

in the previous parts we have done some simple calculations in matrix theory. the basic goals of this paper was
to conrm the conjecture in [18], that a schwarzschild black hole in the regime n >> s can be described as a

vi. conclusion

13

collection of k membranes which each has a longitudinal momentum p  n/kr. this goal was achieved in the
sense that we managed to derive, from rst principles, that the entropy is proportional to the number of membranes.
by estimating the correct potential energy between these clusters we also managed to derive the correct values for the
other parameters of the black hole. we also showed that the same results hold when we use membrane constituents
that are stable against collapse, namely, which are wound around some compact manifold.

clearly, it would be of great interest to also calculate the potential between the clusters from rst principles. this,
however, is a process that involves longitudinal momentum transfer which is a notoriously dicult problem in matrix
theory so we will leave this problem for the future.

i would like to thank rikard von unge and zdenek kopecky for helpful discussions.
