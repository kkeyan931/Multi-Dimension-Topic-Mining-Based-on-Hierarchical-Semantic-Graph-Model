(see second line table 1 table 2.) however, shown that, open orbit, non-hermitian unbroken generators, bi eqs. (2.17) (2.20), constitute borel subalgebra complex isotropy h, closed orbit, bi eq. (2.15) constitute it. dierence plays crucial role orbits. nonlinear realization linear model origin, b-type kahler poten- tials strictly g-invariant independent a- c-type invariants. nd compact kahler manifold submanifold, changed mixed-type generator, q = xn 1, unbroken generator hand orbits. closed orbit, zi bi carry denite charges q eq.

(4.7). moreover, closed orbit, -projection full manifold satisfy perojection conditions (a.6) compact submanifold; hand, open orbit, satisfy perojection conditions com- pact submanifold. we, thus, found compact manifold embedded closed orbit, embedded open orbit. dierences, showed b-type kahler potentials closed orbit still strictly g-invariant, and, hand, b-type kahler potential open orbit reduces one compact homogeneous kahler submanifold, 22 gc/ h = o(n)c/o(n 2)c u(1)c b o(n)/o(n 2) u(1), whose kahler potential g-invariant kahler transformation. known kahler potential compact kahler manifold written sum b-type kahler potentials. may strengthen property: seems even target manifold non-compact, b-type kahler potentials essentially live compact kahler manifolds (embedded target space). also say b-type kahler potentials automatically nd compact homogeneous kahler manifold submanifold full target manifold. discussions. results generalized general mod- els. first, discuss closed orbits. known closed orbit symmetric point, equation h = h c established. maximal realization occurs symmetric point, pure-type multiplet one nd compact submanifold. moreover, mixed-type multiplets belong non-singlet h; hence, combination previous results {$9805038$} leads supersymmet- ric vacuum alignment. pure-type generators arise vacuum alignment non-borelian, since gc-transformation change commutation relations. we, thus, conclude that, closed orbits, kahler potential g-invariant kahler transformation. secondly, discuss open orbits. know whether open orbits vacuum alignment. however seem open orbits vacuum alignment, based examples (the open orbit o(n) model paper u(n) n previous paper {$9805038$}). true, pure-type generators constitute borel subalgebra h. since vacuum alignment, previous results {$9805038$}, concluded mixed-type generators h- singlets.
