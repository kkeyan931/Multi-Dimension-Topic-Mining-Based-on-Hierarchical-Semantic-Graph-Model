abstract

the eective hamiltonian, as obtained from applying the hamiltonian ow equa-
tions to front form qed, are solved numerically for positronium. both the exchange
and the annihilation channels are included. the impact of dierent similarity func-
tions is explicitly studied. perfect numerical agreement with other methods is found.

light-front frame is believed to be a useful tool for solving bound state problems in qcd.
generally, bound state calculations in the eld theory have two sources of complexity -
they are relativistic and of many-body type. the method of ow equations copes with
both of them, at least to the denite order in perturbation theory. one transforms the
hamiltonian to eliminate interactions changing particle number, reducing thus the bound
state problem to a few-body problem. simultaneously utraviolet divergencies occur, origi-
nating from the high-energy region. to complete renormalization one uses either coupling
coherence or xes counterterms to provide nite values for physical observables and to
retain symmetries violated by the procedure [5]. both type of ow equations of renormal-
ization type and for the new (particle number conserving) interactions appear together.
this program can be fullled in perturbation theory expansion. as a result, the bound
state problem is approximated by a set of renormalized, eective interactions that do not
change particle number.

the sensitive tool in the light-front frame to check how accurately one desribes bound
states by these eective interactions is to measure the violation of rotational symmetry.
this symmetry is linked to a dynamical operator on the light-front, since rotations are
dynamical, i.e. depend on the interaction. the symmetry may be spoiled in two steps:
rst, regularization and renormalization; and second, reduction to the eective few-body
interactions with particle number conservation. the nonperturbative renormalization ow
is of crucial importance for qcd [2, 5, 8], but one can disregard this point in qed bound
state calculations, that disentangles the two problems mentioned above. to the leading
order the results for qed are obtained in [4], where positronium system is described
approximately by the eective electron-positron interaction. in the nonrelativistic limit
the results for positronium spectrum agree with the results of covariant calculations.

there are at least two other alternative approaches to solve for bound states in the
light-front dynamics, the scheme of similarity renormalization of glazek and wilson [6]
and the method of iterated resolvents of pauli [8]. in both schemes calculations of the
eective electron-positron interaction are performed and the question of rotational invari-
ance for positronium spectrum is investigated.

calculations done so far in the similarity renormalization scheme use the nonrelativis-
tic limit to nd corresponding eigenvalues in the bound state perturbation theory [3].
analytical calculations are performed there for ground state: ground triplet levels are
degenerate, indicating that rotational symmetry is restored [3]. performing similarity
renormalization one eliminates high-energy modes and absorbs relativistic eects into an
eective band-diagonal hamiltonian, which describes bound state creation at nonrela-
tivistic energy scales. it is a well working scheme for such systems as positronium [5];
therefore nonrelativistic approximations done in this approach to extract eigenvalues from
eective hamiltonian are quite natural there. in general, it is not always the case. in
fact rotational symmetry becomes kinematic one, like light-front boost in the nonrela-
tivistic limit, i.e. total momentum and its projection can be considered approximately as
quantum numbers, that makes simpler to trace rotational invariance in these calculations.
in the method of iterated resolvents an eective electron-positron potential is obtained
and exact numerical solution of positronium bound state equation with the given poten-

2 formulation of the problem

tial is done [10, 11]. degenerate multiplets for ground as well as for exited states are
obtained [10].
it is convenient to perform relativistic calculations in the light-front
frame, which eectively has nonrelativistic kinematics.

1

in the present work we perform relativistic few-body calculations for positronium
spectrum numerically in the spirit of the work trittmann et.al. [10] (and using numerical
code [11]), based on the eective electron-positron hamiltonian obtained by the ow
equations [15]. eective interaction was derived there for dierent cuto functions. the
requirement of block-diagonalization of the hamiltonian determines the generator only up
to a unitary transformation of the blocks; this explains why the eective interaction may
depend on the cuto function. the question we investigate is to what extent rotational
invariance is violated on the level of positronium spectrum and how does it depend on
the choice of the cuto function. we are not able to trace rotational invariance during
the calculations, since it is dynamical operator. this is an excellent test for the method
of ow equations itself and the control of approximations done during the calculations.

2 formulation of the problem

we address to solve a light-front hamiltonian bound state equation

h|i = e|i

(1)

for positronium. using ow equations we transform the qed hamiltonian h to a block-
diagonal eective hamiltonian, which reduces positronium problem to a bound state
problem in the electron-positron sector. the eective hamiltonian for an electron and a
positron is

he = h0 + ue

(2)

where h0 is the kinetic energy, and ue includes eective interactions generated by the
ow equations in the second order in coupling constant. the integral bound state equation
is written

where the eective hamiltonian pickes out from the positronium wave function |i the
lowest ee-component hp1, p2; 1, 2|i with pi, i being the light-front three-momenta and
helicities, respectively, carried by an electron (i = 1), and a positron (i = 2). the primed
quantities refer to the initial state, the unprimed ones to the nal state. the eective
interaction hp1, p2; 1, 2|ue|p
2) will be specied be-
low. in order to deduce a lorentz invariant energy we consider the bound state equation
written for operator p p +, corresponding to the invariant mass-squared m 2 on the light-
front, rather than for the light-front hamiltonian operator h = p . the light-front

of the kinematical state of the bound system, particularly of p + and ~p, which reects

(10)

of the mean-square momentum transfer and the mean-square dierence,

eective interaction (6) includes two dierent lorentz structures: g part insures
the bohr spectrum and is responsible for the spin splittings;  term is diagonal in
spin space and vanishes for real processes, i.e. on mass shell with q2 = 0, making the
eective interaction to coincide with the tamm-danco approximation [15]. the explicit
x-dependence in the denominator of eq. (8) looks like the only remnant of the light-front
formulation; all other quantities are lorentz scalars. one can absorb this dependence by
redening the wave function in the integral equation eq. (4). we introduce instead of
jacobi momentum (x, ~) the three momentum in the center of mass frame ~p = (pz, ~)
as follows

x =

3 rotational invariance

integral equation (4) has rotationally covariant but still not rotationally invariant form
because of the interaction kernel vef f , written in the light-front frame. let us extract the
part of interaction, which has manifestly rotational symmetry.

quite generally  factor eq. (12) is a function of the ratio of its two arguments.

therefore, making use of eq. (14), the eective interaction eq. (6) is given as

where the exchange part is dened

the terms in the eective interaction proportional to (), () depend explicitly on the
choice of cut-o function and arise from l-ordering of the generator in the operator of
unitary transform [15]. explicit form of the eective interaction with dierent cut-o
functions is given in appendix a.

dene energy denominators in equation (25). due to the three-momentum conserva-
tion on the light-front, p1 + p2 = p
2 for longitudinal and transversal components, one
has de  de = da  db, where the energy denominators dk in both channels are given
in eq. (9) and eq. (15). therefore

1 + p

q2 =

p+! m 2 .

(26)

where m 2  the total energy dierence between initial and nal states shows the o-
shellness of process.

where q = pp = (qz, q) is the three-momentum transfer of the photon, and the relations
between mean-squared and dierence momenta and corresponding energy dierences are
given in eq. (11) and eq. (12) for exchange and annihilation channels, respectively.

the second term in eq. (25) is obviously not rotational invariant. for the real pro-
cesses, m 2 = 0, the second term vanishes for both channels, and the eective interaction

and similarly in annihilation channel. the same holds to the leading order of nonrela-
tivistic expansion ~p 2/m2  1 [15].
estimate current-current term in exchange channel, eq. (8), which denes nominator
of the interaction eq. (28). we work in the lepage-brodsky convention for the spinors [9]

(29)

and similarly for v(p, ) with the change m  m and    in the above formula.
the second expression for spinor holds quite in general for the solution of dirac equation,
where p0 = e = ~p 2 + m2 and the normalization factor n = e + pz. here  = 0,

(32)

where no approximations are done so far. excluding the overall normalization factor the
rst lines in eq. (32) for scalar and vector current terms contain rotationally invariant
parts (except terms proportional to kz), which coincide with the corresponding expressions
when making use of bjorken-drell convention for spinors [12]. 2

merkel et.al. [12] showed, that as far as the energy is conserved, this part gives rise
to familiar spin dependent forces. the rest terms in eq. (32) are obviously not rota-
tionally invariant, particularly when the spacial rotations are performed perpendicular
to the z-axis. expanding expression eq. (32) to the second order in |~p|/m  1 and
performing the unitary transformation in spin space, brisudova et.al. [3] obtained breit-
fermi spin-spin and tensor interactions. it seems to be impossible to reproduce full set
of breit-fermi terms from the second order eective interaction in the light-front gauge.
also it is complicated to cover rotational symmetry on the level of light-front eective
hamiltonians without additional approximations are done. we use directly the eective
electron-positron interaction eq. (23) for numerical calculations of positronium spectrum.
we aim to get ne structure and to investigate rotational symmetry on the level of spec-
trum. the impact of dierent cuto functions is also considered. the results of these
calculations are presented in the next section.

4 mass spectrum of positronium

we solve the integral equation (4), with interaction kernel given in eq.(6), for positronium
spectrum numerically. eective interaction with dierent choice of cutos is sumarized
in appendix a.

in polar coordinates the light-front variables are (~; x) = (, ; x); therefore the
matrix elements of the eective interaction eq.(6) depend on the angles  and , i.e.
hx, , ; 1, 2|ve|x, 
2i. in order to introduce the spectroscopic notation for
positronium mass spectrum we integrate out the angular degree of freedom, , introducing
a discrete quantum number jz = n, n  z (actually for the annihilation channel only
|jz|  1 is possible),

rotationally invariant systems) according to their quantum numbers of total angular mo-

operators in light-front dynamics is problematic because they include interactions.

the matrix elements of the eective interaction before integrating over the angles,
2i, and after the integration inroducing the total mo-
2i for dierent cuto functions are given
now we proceed to solve for the positronium spectrum in all sectors of jz. for this pur-
pose we formulate the light-front integral equation eq. (4) in the form where the integral
kernel is given by the eective interaction for the total momentum jz, eq. (35). after the
change of variables eq. (18) we parametrize ~p = (~, pz) = ( sin  cos ,  sin  sin ,  cos ).

the integration domain d, dened in eq. (5), is given now by   [0;

the integral equation eq. (37) is used to calculate positronium mass spectrum numer-
ically. note, that if one succeeds to integrate out the angular degrees of freedom for the
eective interaction eq. (35) analytically, one has 2-dimensional integration in eq. (37)
instead of 3-dimensional one in the original integral equation (4) to perform numerically.
we use the numerical code [11], worked out by uwe trittmann for the similar problem
[10]. this code includes for the numerical integration the gauss-legendre algorithm
(gaussian quadratures). to improve the numerical convergence the technique of coulomb
counterterms is included. the problem has been solved for all components of the total
angular momentum, jz.

2 ]. neither lz nor

positronium spectrum is mainly dened by the coulomb singularity

~q  0 ,

(38)

which is an integrable one analytically and also, by use of technique of coulomb countert-
erms, numerically. in this region q2  0 and the energy denominator q2  ~q 2 eq. (27),
giving rise to the leading order coulomb behavior for the eective interaction eq. (28),
independent on the cuto function. we use therefore standard coulomb counterterms,
introduced for the coulomb problem eq. (28) [10, 11], in the case of all cutos. basing
also on the argument eq. (38), we expect the same pattern of levels for dierent cutos,
that we prove numerically to be true.

another important limiting case to study eective interaction eq. (23), namely its

exchange part, is the collinear limit

that is special for light-front calculations. because of eq. (26) the variable 2  q+ 2,
resulting for the 

 part of eective interaction to be

q+  0 ,

(39)


q+ 2 2(1  (0)) ,

(40)

which is nite in this limit. this is true for the regular cuto functions, as in the case
of exponential and gaussian cutos, where the derivative d(0)/d is well dened. for
sharp cuto this condition is not fullled, and the eective interaction contains the 1/q+
type of singularity in this case (see appendix a). we do not associate any physics with
this singularity, considering it as a consequence of articial choice of cuto, which corre-
sponds to singular generator of unitary transformation eq. (7). we omit the 
 term
in exchange channel for sharp cuto in numerical calculations.

5 conclusion

14

we argued that the region of coulomb singularity, and hence g

 part of eective
interaction, determines mainly the positronium spectrum. however, including 
 part
for gaussian cuto shifts all levels as a whole of about 57%, since this part is diagonal in
spin space (appendix b), and improves the data to be near the result obtained in covariant
equal time calculations (table 1). presumably, it is necessary to take into account 

term in exchange channel also for sharp cuto after the proper regularization of infrared
longitudinal divergences is done.

we place the results of calculations for three dierent cutos, performed in exchange
and including both exchange and annihilation channels, in tables 1 and 2, respectively.
the corresponding set of gures is presented in fig.1 and fig.2. we get the ionization
threshold at m 2  4m2, the bohr spectrum, and the ne structure. including annihilation
part increases the splittings twice as large for the lowest multiplets.
as one can see from presents gures, certain mass eigenvalues at jz = 0 are degenerate
with certain eigenvalues at other jz to a very high degree of numerical precision. as an
example, consider the second lowest eigenvalue for jz = 0. it is degenerate with the lowest
eigenvalue for jz = 1, and can thus be classied as a member of the triplet with j = 1.
correspondingly, the lowest eigenvalue for jz = 0 having no companion can be classied
as the singlet state with j = 0. quite in general one can interpret degenerate multiplets
as members of a state with total angular momentum j = 2jz,max + 1. one can get the
quantum number of total angular momentum j from the number of degenerate states for
a xed eigenvalue m 2
n. one can make contact with the conventional classication scheme
2s+1ljz

j , as indicated in tables 1  2.

such pattern of spectrum is driven by rotational invariance. to trace rotational sym-
metry we calculate the dierence of energy levels between jz = 0 and jz = 1 states for the
lowest multiplets. the data are given for exchange and including annihilation channnel
in tables 3 and 4, respectively. annihilation part makes corresponding states practically
degenerate (see tables 4 and figure 2).

5 conclusion

the numerical solution of positronium bound state problem, with the eective electron-
positron interaction obtained by the ow equations, is presented. no approximations
along numerical procedure are done.

concerning the spin-splittings the best agreement with covariant calculations is ob-
tained for gaussian cuto, the worst results are for sharp cuto. rotational invariance
is traced on the level of spectrum by studing the degree of degeneracy of corresponding
states with the same total momentum but dierent projection jz in the multiplet. again,
better results are obtained for exponential and gaussian cuto functions than for sharp
cuto. this suggests, that smooth cuto functions are preferable to perform calculations.
including annihilation channel improves the extend of degeneracy.

for the sharp cuto the lowest multiplet is placed higher than the one in case of
exponential and gaussian cutos. the reason is in disregarding the infrared divergent
part, which is diagonal in spin space and shifts the spectrum as a whole down. the
question how to regularize this part and include it in mass spectrum calculations should

5 conclusion

15

be considered. generally, the impact of the dierent choice of cuto functions on the
spectrum is small.

in this work we solve the bound state integral equation for the one xed integration in-
terval. integration domain introduces the ultraviolet-cuto dependence of invariant mass
squared m 2(), that reects renormalization group properties of the eective coupling
constant. we leave this question for the future study.

three dierent similarity function will be studied explicitly:

the motivation to choose these cuto functions is the following. using exponential cuto
in ow equations one generates the same interaction as obtained also in tamm-danco
approach,where numerical calculations of positronium spectrum are performed [10], and
we use this numerical code here. note also, that for this cuto the eective interaction
looks very much as in covariant calculations: it contains only g part, and  part
is identically zero, so that there is no collinear problem. gaussian cuto corresponds to
the original choice of generator eq. (7) by wegner as commutator of diagonal, particle
number conserving, and o-diagonal, particle number changing, parts of hamiltonian.
sharp cuto is used often in the alternative similarity scheme to perform calculations [6].

it is useful to display the matrix elements of the eective interaction in the form of
tables. the matrix elements depend on the one hand on the momenta of the electron
and positron, respectively, and on the other hand on their helicities before and after
the interaction. the dependence on the helicities occur during the calculation of these
functions e(x, ~k; 1, 2|x, ~k

the matrix elements of the eective interaction in the annihilation channel are nonzero

only for |jz|  1 due to the restriction on the angular momentum of the photon.
