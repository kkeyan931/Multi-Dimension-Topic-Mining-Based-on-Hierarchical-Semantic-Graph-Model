abstract

we describe how and to what extent the noncommutative two-torus can be ap-
proximated by a tower of nite-dimensional matrix geometries. the approximation
is carried out for both irrational and rational deformation parameters by embedding
the c-algebra of the noncommutative torus into an approximately nite algebra.
the construction is a rigorous derivation of the recent discretizations of noncommu-
tative gauge theories using nite dimensional matrix models, and it shows precisely
how the continuum limits of these models must be taken. we clarify various as-
pects of morita equivalence using this formalism and describe some applications to
noncommutative yang-mills theory.

1 introduction

the relationship between large n matrix models and noncommutative geometry in string
theory was suggested early on in studies of the low energy dynamics of d-branes, where it
was observed [1] that a system of n coincident d-branes has collective coordinates which
are described by mutually noncommuting n  n matrices. various aspects of the large
n limit of such systems have been important to the matrix theory conjecture [2] and
the representation of branes in terms of large n matrices [3]. the connection between
nite dimensional matrix algebras and noncommutative riemann surfaces is the basis for
the fact that large n matrix theory contains m2-branes. a more precise connection to
noncommutative geometry came with the observation [4] that the most general solutions
to the quotient conditions for toroidal compactication of the ikkt matrix model [5]
are given by connections of vector bundles over a noncommutative torus. the resulting
large n matrix model is noncommutative yang-mills theory which is dual to the low-
energy dynamics of open strings ending on d-branes in the background of a constant
neveu-schwarz two-form eld [6].

the description of noncommutative tori and their gauge bundles as the large n limit
of some sort of tower of nite-dimensional matrix geometries is therefore an important,
yet elusive, problem. this correspondence was described at a very heuristic level in
[7], while a denition of noncommutative gauge theory as the large n limit of a matrix
model has been made more precise recently in [8, 9]. in particular, in [9] it was shown
how the standard projective modules [10, 11] over the noncommutative two-torus can be
discretized in terms of nite-dimensional matrix algebras. this immediately raises an
apparent paradox. a standard result asserts that the noncommutative torus cannot be
described by any approximately nite dimensional algebra. this means that it cannot
be written explicitly as the large n limit of some sequence of nite dimensional matrix
algebras. one way to understand this is in terms of k-theory. k-theory groups are stable
under deformations of algebras, and those of the ordinary torus t2 are non-trivial. the
deformation of the algebra of functions on t2 to the noncommutative torus therefore
preserves this non-trivial k-theory structure. on the other hand, the k1 group of any
approximately nite dimensional algebra is trivial (see for instance [12]). in fact, it is
precisely this k-theoretic stability which immediately implies that there is a canonical
map between gauge bundles on ordinary t2 and gauge bundles on the noncommutative
torus. this canonical map is constructed explicitly in [6].

however, this mathematical reasoning would seem to put very stringent restrictions
on the allowed observables of eld theories dened on the noncommutative torus. the
generators of a noncommutative torus with a deformation parameter  that is a rational
number can be represented by nite dimensional (clock and shift) matrices. there is
no such matrix description in the case that  is irrational. however, an irrational (or
rational)  can always be represented as the limit of a sequence n of rational numbers.
from a physical standpoint, we would expect any correlation function c of a eld theory

2

on such noncommutative tori to be a continuous function of , so that c() = limn c(n).
this means that there must be some sense in which observables of noncommutative yang-
mills theory can be approximated as the large n limit of a sequence of those for nite
dimensional matrix models. such an approximation scheme is reminescent of fuzzy spaces
[13], whereby the multiplication law of the algebra of functions is approximated by a
particular matrix multiplication. although the space of functions on a manifold is not an
approximately nite dimensional algebra, its product is approximated arbitrarily well as
n  . however, the algebras which are deformations of function algebras are somewhat
distinct from fuzzy spaces which are typically nite dimensional [14], and the algebraic
approximation in the case of the noncommutative torus must come about in a dierent
way.

in this paper we will show precisely how to do this. the main point is that although
the algebra of the noncommutative torus is not approximately nite, it can be realized
as a subalgebra of an algebra which is built from a certain tower of nite dimensional
matrix algebras [15]. as an important byproduct we solve what has been a problem
for the physical interpretation of the deformation parameter of the algebra of the torus.
the mathematical properties of the noncommutative torus depend crucially on whether
or not the parameter  is a rational number. certain distinct values of  are connected
by morita equivalence, and the set of equivalent s is dense on the real line. this is
similar (and in some cases equivalent) to the phenomenon of t-duality in string theory
[6, 16]. nevertheless, with a particular choice of background elds,  is in principle an
observable variable, and it would be wrong to expect that the fact that  is rational
or not could have measurable physical consequences.
in what follows we will see how
it is possible to approximate the algebra with irrational or rational  by a sequence of
nite dimensional matrix algebras. as an immediate corollary, the physical quantities
that one calculates as the limit (which we show exists) are continuous functions of . in
fact, we will show that all morita equivalent noncommutative tori can be embedded into
the same approximately nite algebra, so that the present construction shows that all
noncommutative gauge theories can be approximated within a unifying framework. this
description is therefore useful for analysing the phase structure of noncommutative yang-
mills theory, as a function of , using matrix models. the results presented in the following
give a very precise meaning to the denition of noncommutative yang-mills theory as the
large n limit of a matrix model, and at the same time clarify in a rigorous manner the way
that the eld content, observables and correlators of the matrix model must be mapped to
the continuum gauge theory. this is particularly important for numerical computations
in which the interest is in determining quantities in noncommutative yang-mills theory
in terms of those of large matrices at nite n. such large n limits are also important for
describing the dynamics of matrix theory, whereby the n  n matrix geometries coincide
with the parameter spaces of systems of n d0-branes.

this paper is organized as follows. in section 2 we shall describe this construction,
and discuss exactly in what sense the generators of any noncommutative torus can be

3

approximated by large n matrices. in section 3 we will then show that this procedure
can be used to approximate correlation functions for eld theories on the noncommu-
tative torus in terms of expectation values constructed from matrices acting on a nite
dimensional vector space. in section 4 we show how to express geometries on the non-
commutative torus, including gauge bundles, in terms of a tower of matrix geometries.
section 5 contains some concluding remarks.

2 af-algebras and the noncommutative torus

the algebra a of smooth functions on the noncommutative two-torus t2
-algebra generated by two unitary elements u1, u2 with the relation

 is the unital

u1u2 = e 2i u2u1 .

a generic element a  a is written as a convergent series of the form

a = x(m,n)z2

amn (u1)m(u2)n

(2.1)

(2.2)

where amn is a complex-valued schwarz function on z2, i.e. a sequence of complex numbers
{amn  c | (m, n)  z2} which decreases rapidly at innity. when the deformation
parameter  = m/n is a rational number, with m and n positive integers which we
take to be relatively prime, the algebra am/n is intimately related to the algebra c(t2)
of smooth functions on the ordinary torus t2. precisely, am/n is morita equivalent to
c(t2), i.e. am/n is a twisted matrix bundle over c(t2) of topological charge m whose
bers are n  n complex matrix algebras. physically, this implies that noncommutative
u(1) yang-mills theory with rational deformation parameter  = m/n is dual to a
conventional u(n) yang-mills theory with m units of t hooft ux.

the algebra am/n has a huge center c(am/n ) which is generated by the elements
(u1)n and (u2)n . one identies c(am/n ) with the algebra c(t2), while the appearence
of nite dimensional matrix algebras can be seen as follows. with  = e 2im/n , one
introduces the n  n clock and shift matrices

= in .

(2.4)

since m and n are relatively prime, the matrices (2.3) generate the nite dimensional
algebra mn (c) of n  n complex matrices [17].1 furthermore, there is a surjective
algebra morphism

 : am/n  mn (c)

(2.5)

given by

 x(m,n)z2

amn (u1)m(u2)n = x(m,n)z2

amn (cid:16)eu1(cid:17)m(cid:16)eu2(cid:17)n

,

(2.6)

under which the whole center c(am/n ) is mapped to c.

when mn (c) is thought of as the lie algebra gl(n, c), a basis is provided by the

n  n matrices

eq. (2.9) is recognized as the poisson-lie algebra of functions on t2 with respect to the
usual poisson bracket. in a unitary representation of the algebra (2.8), anti-hermitian
combinations of the traceless matrices t (n )
span the lie algebra su(n). this identies
the symplectomorphism algebra (2.9) of the torus with su() [18] which is an example
of a universal gauge symmetry algebra [7]. this identication has been exploited recently
in [19] to study the perturbative renormalizability properties of noncommutative yang-
mills theory. for nite n, su(n) may be regarded as the lie algebra of innitesimal
reparametrizations of the algebra described by (2.7) and (2.8). given these connections,
it follows that the noncommutative two-torus coincides with the parameter space of matrix
theory.

in what follows we shall be interested in taking the limit where both n, m  
with the ratio m/n approaching a xed irrational or rational number. this is the type
of limit considered in [9], and it yields the appropriate embeddings of matrix algebras
into the innite dimensional c-algebra which describes the noncommutative spacetime
of d0-branes in matrix theory [2]. for nite n, the matrix model consists of maps of a
quantum riemann surface (the noncommutative toroidal m2-brane) into a noncommu-
tative transverse space. in the case where  is an irrational number, the algebra (2.1)
cannot be mapped to any subalgebra of su(). we would like to investigate how and to
what extent the geometries for a can be approximated by towers of matrix geometries.
naively, one could think of considering the algebra a as the inductive limit of a sequence
1if m and n are not coprime then the generated algebra would be a proper subalgebra of mn (c).

of nite dimensional -algebras. this would be tantamount to (the closure of) a being
an approximately nite dimensional c-algebra. as we mentioned in the previous section,
this is not the case, as can be easily seen for any value of  using cohomological arguments.
the k-theory groups of t2
) = z  z, n = 0, 1, just as for the ordinary torus
t2. on the other hand, the group k1 of any approximately nite algebra is necessarily
trivial [12].

 are kn(t2

2.1 af-algebras

in [15], pimsner and voiculescu have shown that there is the possibility to realize the
c-algebra a, which is the norm closure of the algebra of smooth functions a, as
a subalgebra of a larger, approximately nite dimensional c-algebra.
in a classical
sense, this would mean that an embedded submanifold of t2
 is induced by the parameter
space geometries. this is analogous to what happens in matrix theory, whereby the
noncommutative target space is realized as a submanifold of the matrix parameter
space of n d0-branes. before describing this embedding, we shall in this subsection
briey describe some general properties of the class of approximately nite algebras [20].

a unital c-algebra a is said to be approximately nite dimensional (af for short) if

there exists an increasing sequence

a0

1 a1

2 a2

3   

n an

n+1

   

(2.10)

of nite dimensional c-subalgebras of a such that a is the norm closure of the union

sn an , a =sn an. the maps n are injective -morphisms. without loss of generality
one may assume that each an contains the unit i of a and that the maps n are unital.
the algebra a is the inductive limit of the inductive system of algebras {an, n}nz+ [12].
as a set, sn an is made of coherent sequences,

[n=0

an =na = (an)nz+ , an  an (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) n0 , an = n(an1) n > n0o .

the sequence (kankan)nz+ is eventually decreasing since kan+1k  kank (the maps n
are norm decreasing) and is therefore convergent. the norm on a is given by

(2.11)

(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)(an)nz+(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13) = lim

n(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)an(cid:13)(cid:13)(cid:13)an

.

(2.12)

since the maps n are injective, the expression (2.12) gives a true norm directly and not
merely a semi-norm, and there is no need to quotient out the zero norm elements.

since each subalgebra an is nite dimensional, it is a direct sum of matrix algebras,

an =

knmk=1

m

d(n)

k

(c) ,

(2.13)

where md(c) is the algebra of d  d matrices with complex entries and endowed with
its usual hermitian conjugation and operator norm. on the other hand, given a unital

6

embedding a1  a2 of the algebras a1 = ln1

(c), one
can always choose suitable bases in a1 and a2 in such a way as to identify a1 with a
subalgebra of a2 having the form

(c) and a2 = ln2

by means of a diagram, the so-called bratteli diagram [20], which can be constructed out
of the dimensions d(1)
, k = 1, . . . , n2 of the diagonal blocks of
j
the two algebras, and out of the numbers nkj that describe the partial embeddings. one
draws two horizontal rows of vertices, the top (bottom resp.) one representing a1 (a2
resp.) and consisting of n1 (n2 resp.) vertices, one for each block which are labeled by the
corresponding dimensions d(1)
n1 (d(2)
n2 resp.). then, for each j = 1, . . . , n1
and k = 1, . . . , n2, one has a relation d(1)

partially embedded in m

for any af-algebra a one repeats this procedure for each level, and in this way one
obtains a semi-innite diagram which completely denes a up to isomorphism. this
diagram depends not only on the collection of ans but also on the particular sequence
{an, n}nz+ which generates a. however, one can obtain an algorithm which allows
one to construct from a given diagram all diagrams which dene af-algebras that are
isomorphic to the original one [20]. the problem of identifying the limit algebra or of
determining whether or not two such limits are isomorphic can be very subtle. in [21] an
invariant for af-algebras has been devised in terms of the corresponding k-theory which
completely distinguishes among them. note that the isomorphism class of an af-algebra

sn an depends not only on the collection of algebras an but also on the way that they

are embedded into one another.

2.2 embedding the noncommutative torus in an af-algebra:

irrational case

we are now ready to describe the realization [15] of the algebra a as a subalgebra of a
larger, af algebra a which is determined by the k-theory of a (to be precise k0(a)).

7

while in [15] the values of  are taken to be irrational and to lie in the interval (0, 1), we
shall repeat the construction for an arbitrary real-valued deformation parameter. in this
subsection we shall take  to be irrational. the case of rational  will be described in the
next subsection.

it is known [22] that any   r q has a unique representation as a simple continued

fraction expansion

(2.17)
in terms of positive integers ck > 0 (k  1) and c0  z. the n-th convergents n of the
expansion are given by

(2.18)

one also writes this as

the relatively prime integers pn and qn may be computed recursively using the formulae

 = [c0, c1, c2, . . . ] .

(2.19)

pn = cnpn1 + pn2
qn = cnqn1 + qn2

,

,

p0 = c0 , p1 = c0c1 + 1
q0 = 1 , q1 = c1

(2.20)

for n  2. note that all qns are strictly positive, qn > 0, while pn  z, and that both qn
and |pn| are strictly increasing sequences which therefore diverge as n  .

for each positive integer n, we let mqn(c) denote the nite dimensional c-algebra
of qn  qn complex matrices acting on the nite dimensional hilbert space cqn which is
endowed with its usual inner product and its canonical orthonormal basis ~e (n)
, 1  j  qn.
then, for any integer n, consider the semi-simple algebra

2in [15], in order to explicitly construct the embedding of the noncommutative torus algebra in the limit
af-algebra, the embeddings (2.22) are conjugated with suitable (and rather involved) unitary operators

since the two embeddings are the same up to an inner automorphism, the limit algebra is the same [20].

(2.20). the norm closure of the inductive limit

a =

an

[n=0

(2.23)

is the af-algebra that we are looking for. as mentioned in the previous subsection, the
elements of a are coherent sequences {gn}nz+, gn  an, with gn = n(gn1) for n
suciently large, or limits of coherent sequences. it is useful to visualize them as innite
matrices and we shall also loosely write a = m(c).

from the discussion of the previous subsection it follows that the embeddings an1

an are completely determined by the collection of partial embeddings {cn}. the corre-

as a consequence, the group k0(a) can be obtained as the inductive limit of the induc-
tive system {n : k0(an1)  k0(an)}nz+ of ordered groups. since k0(an) = z  z
(with the canonical ordering z+  z+) it follows that [23]

this is a total ordering since for all pairs of integers (z, w), one has either z + w  0 or
z + w < 0. we shall comment more on the k-theory group (2.25) later on. furthermore,

these k-theoretic properties will enable us in section 4 to map a gauge bundle over a
matrix algebra to a gauge bundle over the noncommutative torus.

thus, within each nite dimensional matrix algebra an there is the subalgebra (an) 
(an1) which is represented by clock and shift matrices. the main result of ref. [15] is
the statement that the algebra (an)  (an1) can be taken to be a nite dimensional
approximation of the algebra a of the noncommutative torus in the following sense. first
of all, notice that n(eu (n1)

proposition 1 can be proven similarly to proposition 3 below, and will therefore be omit-
it implies that there exist unitary operators ua  a , a = 1, 2, which are not
ted.
themselves coherent sequences, but which can be written as a limit of such a sequence
with respect to the operator norm of a. because of (2.17), (2.18) and (2.30), the oper-
ators ua so dened satisfy (2.1) and therefore generate the subalgebra a  a. thus,
there exists a unital injective -morphism  : a  a.3 this also means that at su-
ciently large level n in the af-algebra a, the generators of the algebra (2.30) may be
well approximated by the images under the injection n of the corresponding matrices
generating an1. it is in this sense that the elements of the algebra a may be approxi-
mated by suciently large nite dimensional matrices. in what follows we shall show how

3the canonical representation of a is on the hilbert space l2(t2), which by fourier expansion

coincides with 2(z2).

torus t2
.

an important consequence of these results is the fact that morita equivalent noncom-
mutative tori can be embedded in the same af-algebra a. from (2.25) and (2.26)
we know that k0(a) = z + z as an ordered group. on the other hand, it is known
[23] that z + z and z + z are order isomorphic if and only if there is an element
c d(cid:17)  gl(2, z) such that
(cid:16) a b

(2.31)

 =

a + b
c + d

.

from the point of view of continued fraction expansions, if  = [c0, c1, c2, . . .] and  =
[c0, c1, c2, . . .], the relation (2.31) is the statement that the two expansions have the same
tails, i.e. that cn = cn+m for some integer m and for n suciently large [22]. but (2.31)
is just the morita equivalence relation between a and a [24]. thus, on the one hand
we rediscover the known fact that morita equivalent tori have the same k0 group,4 but
we can also infer that morita equivalent algebras can be embedded in the same (up to
isomorphism) af-algebra a. morita equivalent algebras can be embedded in the same
a because their sequences of embeddings are the same up to a nite number of terms.
in section 4 this will be the key property which allows the construction of projective
modules within the same approximation, and the physical consequences will be that dual
noncommutative yang-mills theories all lie within the same af-algebra a.

let us now describe the innite dimensional hilbert space h on which a is repre-
sented as (bounded) operators. it is similarly dened by an inductive limit determined by
the bratteli diagram of fig. 1. for any integer n, consider the nite dimensional hilbert
space

hn = cqn  cqn1

on which the algebra an in (2.21) naturally acts. next, consider the embeddings hn1

h =

(2.35)

this ensures that the vectors of h, which are built from the coherent sequences of
sn hn, are indeed convergent. note that the elements of a coherent sequence are related
inductively at each level by ~vn  ~wn = n(~vn1  ~wn1) for n suciently large, or

in the same spirit by which we think of elements of a as innite matrices, we also
visualize elements of h as square summable complex sequences and write h = 2(z).

2.3 embedding the noncommutative torus in an af-algebra:

rational case

everything we have said in the previous subsection is true for irrational , but in many
instances one is still interested in the case of rational deformation parameters. even
though morita equivalence implies that the algebra a is then equivalent in a certain
sense to the algebra of functions on the ordinary torus t2, the physical theories built on
the two algebras can have dierent characteristics (analogously to the case of t-duality
between dierent brane worldvolume eld theories). indeed, physical correlation functions
should not have a discontinuous behaviour between rational and irrational deformation
parameters. furthermore, as shown in [25], the noncommutative yang-mills description
is the physically signicant one in the infrared regime as a local eld theory of the light
degrees of freedom, even though this theory is equivalent by duality to ordinary yang-mills
theory.

when  is rational one can repeat, to some extent, the constructions of the previous
subsection, but one needs to excercise some care due to the occurence of continued fraction
expansions which are not simple, i.e. some cns in the expansion vanish. in this case,
although the second equality in (2.18) does not make sense if cn = 0, one can nonetheless
dene the n-convergent n by the rst equality in (2.18), i.e. n = pn/qn, with pn and
qn dened recursively by the formulae (2.20) (recall that qn > 0 always). thus, we let
 = p/q with p, q relatively prime. the simple continued fraction expansion of , which
is unique, will terminate at some level n0, so that

 =

p
q

=hc0, c1, . . . , cn0i .

12

(2.38)

however, we may still approximate  by an innite but not simple continued fraction
expansion in the following manner. first, above the level n0, we take all even cs to
vanish,

consequently, from (2.20) we get

cn0+2n = 0

,

n  0 .

pn0+2n = p

,

qn0+2n = q

;

n  0

so that

n0+2n =

p
q

,

n  0 .

(2.39)

(2.40)

(2.41)

as for the odd cs (above the level n0), we shall not specify cn0+1 at the moment, while
we take

from (2.20) we get

cn0+2n+1 = 1

,

n > 0 .

pn0+2n+1 = np + pn0+1

,

qn0+2n+1 = nq + qn0+1

;

n  0

so that

n0+2n+1 =

np + pn0+1
nq + qn0+1

n

p
q

.

(2.42)

(2.43)

(2.44)

thus, we can write the rational number p/q as the innite but not simple continued
fraction expansion

if necessary, we shall use the arbitrariness in cn0+1 to x pn0+1 and qn0+1 in such a way
that pn0+2n+1 and qn0+2n+1 are relatively prime integers. in this way we obtain innite,
strictly increasing sequences of relatively prime integers qn0+2n+1 and |pn0+2n+1|, and the
constructions and proofs of the previous subsection can be adapted to the present situa-
tion.

we are now ready to construct the af-algebra a in which to embed the noncommu-
tative torus with rational deformation parameter. note that, generally, the isomorphism
class of an af-algebra is completely characterized by the innite tail of its bratteli dia-
gram, which for the present case is depicted in fig. 2(a). a comparison with fig. 1 for
the irrational case shows that the algebra for rational  is of the same kind, with the
additional rule that for vanishing cs in the fractional expansion there is no link in the
bratteli diagram. from fig. 2(a) we see that by going from an odd level to the next even
one, one simply exchanges the factors in the decomposition, and thus it is better to glue
an odd level to the next even one. this produces the bratteli diagram in fig. 2(b), which
we stress describes the very same af-algebra a. there we have dened

that it contributes to the increase of dimension in the rst factor of bn, the constant part

then, exactly as it happens for the irrational situation, within each nite dimensional
matrix algebra bn there is the subalgebra (an)  (ap/q) with an and ap/q rational
noncommutative tori and  the representation in nite dimensional matrices as given in
(2.5,2.6) and (2.28,2.29), i.e.
in contrast to the
irrational case, however, it now follows from the form of the second factor in the nite
dimensional algebras that n(0qn1  (ap/q)) = 0qn  (ap/q), while it is still true that
n((an1)0q) 6= (an1)0q. consequently we have an analogue of proposition 1 and
the statement that the algebra (an)  (ap/q) can be taken to be a nite dimensional
approximation of the algebra a of the noncommutative torus with rational deformation
parameter  = p/q. finally, the innite dimensional hilbert space h on which a is
represented is given at level n by the nite dimensional vector space

hn = cqn  cq

on which the algebra bn in (2.47) naturally acts. the embeddings hn1
read o from the bratteli diagram in fig. 2(b) and are given by

3 approximating correlation functions

consider an operator g  a and states ,   h. the element g is a particular
combination of the generators ua, a = 1, 2, of the noncommutative torus and the vec-
tors ,  may be represented by particular coherent sequences {n}nz+,{m}mz+ with
n, n  hn. we are interested in evaluating the correlation function

c() = h , gi

(3.1)

where, for simplicity, we indicate only the dependence of the correlator on the deformation
parameter of the algebra. according to proposition 1 (and its counterpart for the rational

15

case), there is a corresponding sequence of operators gn  (an)  (an1), obtained
by replacing the uas by eu (n)
everywhere, which approximate g in the sense that
limn kgn  gk = 0. using this sequence we can also consider the correlation functions

a  eu (n1)

a

cn(n) = hn , gnnihn .

(3.2)

we wish to show that the correlators (3.2) for suciently large n give a good approxi-
mation to the correlation function (3.1), i.e. c() = limn cn(n). this will be true if, as
one moves from one level to the next in the coherent sequence, the corresponding expec-
tation values of the operator gn+1 are approximated by the functions (3.2). this property
will follow immediately from the following

proposition 2. given any two sequences of vectors n1, n1  hn1, dene

proof. we will give the proof for the case of irrational . the proof for the rational case
is a straightforward modication of the normalizations of the immersions. let n1 =
~vn1  ~wn1 and n1 = ~v n1  ~w n1, with ~vn1, ~v n1  cqn1 and ~wn1, ~w n1  cqn2.

in the rst sum in (3.4), we add and subtract e 2in1(j1) to each of the dierences of

each vanish in the limit n  . for the remaining dierences

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) e 2in1(j1)  e 2in(j1+cnqn1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ,

we use the inequality [15]

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) e 2in1l  e 2in(l+mqn1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) = (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) e 2in1(l+mqn1)  e 2in(l+mqn1)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

which holds for every pair of integers l, m with |l + mqn1|  qn. from (2.20) it therefore
follows that

where n  0 and we have assumed that n is suciently large. because the vectors n1
and n1 are cauchy sequences in h, the sequence of inner products in (3.8) converges.
since qn  , this shows that the rst sum in (3.4) vanishes as n  . in a similar
way one proves that the second sum in (3.4) vanishes as n  .

can be

on the vectors n1 and n1, and a product of normalization factors (1 + cn)1/2. since
each cn  1, we then nd

proposition 2 can be generalized straightforwardly to arbitrary powers of the uas,
and also to products u1u2 by inserting a complete set of states of h in between u1 and
u2. it represents the appropriate limiting procedure that one could use in a numerical
simulation of the correlation functions. namely, one starts with suciently large vectors
and matrices which approximate a correlation function (3.1) and then iterates the vectors
to the next level according to the embedding (2.33) (or (2.55) for the rational case). from
this procedure one may in fact estimate the rate of convergence of the approximation to
the desired correlator. as a simple example, we have checked numerically the convergence
of the quantities

dn+m  n+m1      n() , (cid:16)eu (n+m)

a

a

 eu (n+m1)

for various cases. for the deformation parameter we have taken the golden ratio  =
which is characterized by cn = 1, n  0, and which is known to be the slowest converging

continued fraction. in this case pn = qn1 is the n-th element of the fibonacci sequence.
nevertheless, the convergence of the n to  is quite rapid: for n = 15 the accuracy is of
one part in 106 and the matrices are of size 610  610. starting with various choices of
,  and n, the expression (3.12) converges to denite values quite fast in m, with the
dierence between successive evaluations steadily decreasing. for example, for random
vectors  and  with a starting value n = 5 and for m = 13 immersions, the dierence
between successive evaluations is less than a part in 103 at the end of the iterations. for
other irrational s the convergence will be faster, and so will be the growth in dimension
of the matrices.

4 approximating geometries

thus far the approximating schemes we have discussed have been at the level of c-
algebras. in the context of noncommutative geometry, this means that all of our equiva-
lences hold only at the level of topology (this is actually the geometrical meaning of morita
equivalence). the algebra a on its own does not specify the geometry of the underly-
ing noncommutative space, and the latter is determined by the specication of a k-cycle
[10, 26]. the algebra am/n is essentially just a matrix algebra, and for it there exists
choices of k-cycles corresponding to the deformed torus, the fuzzy two-sphere, and even
the fuzzy three-sphere [13]. in this section we will describe how to obtain the k-cycle ap-
propriate to the noncommutative torus t2
 from the embedding of a into the af-algebra
a. in a more physical language, this will tell us how to approximate derivative terms for
eld theories on the noncommutative torus and also how to approximate gauge theories,
as in [9]. as far as large n matrix theory is concerned, this choice of k-cycle will be just
one possible d0-brane parameter space geometry in the noncommutative spacetime.

on t2

, there are natural linear derivations a dened by

a(ub) = 2i ab ub

,

a, b = 1, 2 .

(4.1)

these derivations can be used to construct the canonical dirac operator on t2
, and hence
the k-cycle appropriate to the (noncommutative) riemannian geometry of the two-torus.
with the canonical derivations (4.1), a connection a on a vector bundle h over the
noncommutative torus may be dened as a hermitian operator acting on h and satisfying
the property

[a, ub] = 2 ab ub

(4.2)
here the bundle h is taken to be a nitely-generated, left projective module over the
noncommutative torus and (4.2) is a statement about operators acting on the left on h.
indeed, it is nothing but the usual leibniz rule.

,

a, b = 1, 2 .

in general, it is not possible to approximate the dening property (4.2) by nite di-
mensional matrices. it is, however, straightforward to construct an exponentiated version

18

of this constraint in each algebra an. for this, it is convenient to use a dierent repre-
sentation for the generators of the algebra (2.30), namely

heu (n)

5the construction given below, as well those of [15] and in the preceeding sections of this paper,
are strictly speaking only true in the continuous category, i.e. at the level of the lie group of unitary
matrices. once we have the required approximation at hand, however, we may pass to the corresponding
lie algebra of hermitian matrices and hence to the smooth category wherein the connections lie.

proposition 3 implies that the operators e i

iterating (4.9) and continuing to s  r, this property is seen to be the s = 1 limit of the
equation

dierentiating (4.10) with respect to s and then setting s = 0 yields

e isa ub e isa = e 2israab ub .

[a, ub] = 2ra ab ub .

(4.10)

(4.11)

from this commutator we infer that the operators a satisfy the appropriate leibniz
rule and therefore dene a connection on a bundle over the noncommutative torus t2
.
the matrices (4.6) thereby give a nite dimensional approximation, in the spirit of the
present paper, to the connection a. from (4.11) we see that the numbers ra dened by
(4.5) represent the lengths of the two sides of t2. moreover, from (4.7) we nd that the
connection a has constant curvature

h1 , 2i =

2ir1r2



.

(4.12)

a

the objects presented here thereby dene connections of the modules h0,1 over the non-
commutative torus which have rank |p q| =  and topological charge q = 1 [11]. gauge
elds may be introduced in the usual way now by constructing functions of elements in
the commutants of the algebras generated by u (n)
and ua. the more general class of con-
stant curvature modules hp,q [11] can likewise be constructed using the tensor product
decomposition described in [9]. we will omit the details of this somewhat tedious gener-
alization. notice that at the nite dimensional level, all of the operators we have dened
live in the same algebra a. in the inductive limit however, while the u (n)
go to the
algebra of the noncommutative torus, the unitary operators giving the connection a go
to a morita equivalent one. thus in the large n limit here we reproduce the known fact
[11] that the endomorphism algebra of hp,q is a noncommutative torus which is morita
equivalent to the original one. the reason for this correct reproduction of gauge theories
in the limit is k-theoretic and was discussed in section 2.

5 conclusions

the constructions presented in this paper show that it is indeed possible to represent both
geometrical and physical quantities dened over the noncommutative torus as a certain
limit of nite dimensional matrices. these results give a systematic and denitive way to
realize the spectral geometry, and also the noncommutative gauge theory, of t2
 for any

20

  r by an innite tower of nite dimensional matrix geometries. it should be stressed
though that the types of large n limits described in this paper are somewhat dierent
in spirit than those used for brane constructions from matrix models [2, 3, 5], which are
rooted in the fuzzy space approximations to function algebras [13]. the present matrix
approximations are more suited to the denition of noncommutative yang-mills theory
in terms of type iib superstrings in d-brane backgrounds [8]. it would be interesting to
carry out the constructions of string theoretical degrees of freedom in terms of the above
decompositions of the noncommutative torus into nite dimensional matrices, and thus
test the correspondence between noncommutative gauge theoretic predictions with those
of the matrix models.

the constructions of this paper also shed some light on the precise meaning of morita
equivalence in such physical models. although morita equivalence does imply a certain
duality between (noncommutative) yang-mills theories, within the matrix approximations
there is essentially no distinction between rational and irrational deformation parameters
and hence no reason for a model with rational  to be regarded as completely equivalent to
an ordinary (commutative) gauge theory. this is in agreement with the recent hierarchical
classication of noncommutative yang-mills theories given in [25]. it should always be
understood that morita equivalence is a duality between c-algebras, and as such it
is topological. the equivalence at the level of geometry typically goes away upon the
introduction of appropriate k-cycles (as is the usual case for t-duality equivalences as
well). on the other hand, we have shown that dual yang-mills theories all originate from
the same af-algebra a.

we close with some remarks about how these results may be generalized to higher
dimensional noncommutative tori and hence to more physically relevant noncommutative
yang-mills theories. the algebra of functions on a d-dimensional noncommutative torus
td

 is generated by d unitary operators satisfying the relations

uaub = e 2iab ubua

,

a, b = 1, . . . , d

(5.1)

where  = [ab] is an antisymmetric, real-valued d  d matrix. it is always possible to
rotate  into a canonical skew-diagonal form with skew-eigenvalues a,

where 2r is the rank of . thus one may embed the algebra of a higher dimensional
noncommutative torus into a d-fold tensor product of algebras corresponding to r non-
commutative two-tori t2

however, the issue of generalizing the constructions of the present paper to higher di-
mensions in this manner is still a delicate issue.
it turns out [27] that for almost all
noncommutative tori (precisely, for a set of deformation parameters of lebesgue measure
1) one may can construct an af algebra in which to embed the algebra of functions on
