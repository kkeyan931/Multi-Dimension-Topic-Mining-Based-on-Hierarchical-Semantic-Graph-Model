abstract

a compactication of 11-dimensional supergravity with two (or more) walls

is considered. the whole tower of massive kaluza-klein modes along the fth

dimension is taken into account. with the sources on the walls, an explicit com-

position in terms of kaluza-klein modes of massless gravitino (in the supersym-

metry preserving case) and massive gravitino (in the supersymmetry breaking

case) is obtained. the superhiggs eect is discussed in detail.

1 introduction

the mtheoretic extension of the heterotic e8  e8 string leads to a geometric
picture of two walls (branes) at the ends of a nite 11-dimensional interval [1].

while the supergravity multiplet can penetrate in the d = 11 bulk, the two e8
gauge multiplets are conned to the two walls, respectively. when further six

of the dimensions are compactied one can construct models with gauge elds

living on the d = 4 walls while gravity could, in addition, extend to the higher

dimensional interval [2]. this could then be viewed as the m-theoretic generaliza-

tion of hidden sector supergravity models [3]. these models typically contain two

sectors, an observable sector that contains the usual elds like quarks, leptons

and gauge bosons as well as their supersymmetric partners and a hidden sector,

coupled to the observable sector via interactions of gravitational strength. here

the two sectors can now be identied with the gauge systems that live on the two

separated walls. such a picture is common in modern string-brane theories. the

role of the walls is in general played by higher dimensional p-branes that support

gauge groups, while gravitational interactions can communicate between spatially

seperated branes. in type i theories we have e.g. d-branes with gauge bosons

originating from open string whose ends are conned to the (stack of coincident)

d-branes, while closed strings (and thus gravitational interactions) can live in the

bulk.

the hidden sector of the above mentioned supergravity models was supposed

to be responsible for the breakdown of supersymmetry [4]. this breakdown of

supersymmetry was transmitted to the observable sector via gravitational inter-

actions. if the breakdown originated through the vacuum expectation value of
an auxiliary eld of size f = m 2

s, the value of the gravitino mass is given by

m3/2 

m 2
s

mplanck

,

(1)

where the planck mass represents the suppression due to the gravitational inter-

actions, and the size of the soft supersymmetry breaking terms in the observable

sector was given by the gravitino mass.

in the modern picture one would now assume that supersymmetry is broken

at a hidden wall [5] and the transmission of that breakdown to the observable

wall is mediated via bulk elds. the size of supersymmetry breakdown in the

observable sector would be suppressed for widely seperated walls. naively one

might have assumed that the new picture would lead to a value of the gravitino

mass even more suppressed than in the classical case (1). a closer inspection,

however, shows a similar suppression [6, 7]

once the distance r between the branes and the the higher dimensional planck

the estimate of the gravitino mass in (2) was obtained [6, 8, 9] using a the

simplied approximation according to which the higher dimensional bulk elds
were integrated out via an averaging proceedure1. in this picture, the goldstino

mode was represented by the lowest kaluzaklein 0 mode of a higher dimen-
sional eld . in the superhiggs mechanism this mode supplies the additional

degrees of freedom to render the gravitino massive. qualitatively this simpli-

ed approximation does give a consistent picture, but there remain some open

questions and potential problems when one looks into details of the superhiggs

mechanism. in this paper we would like to point out these potential problems

and show how they can be resolved. the open questions will be presented in

the following section. in section 3 we shall then discuss the gravitino in the case

of unbroken supersymmetry in full generality. broken supersymmetry and the

superhiggs mechanism will be analysed in section 4. in the following section

we shall discuss the consequences of our analysis. this will include a discussion

of the possible nature of the goldstino (is it a bulk or a wall eld), the relation

to the scherk-schwarz mechanism [12] in that context [13] and an upper limit

for the gravitino mass in the present picture. we shall argue that a meaningful

realization of the superhiggs mechanism seems to require some modes in the

bulk other than the graviton and the gravitino. finally we shall comment on

the phenomenological consequences of this ndings, including a discussion of the

nature of the soft breaking terms on both walls.

2 some open questions and puzzles

specically we want to address the following two questions:

1a corresponding analysis in global supersymmetry has been performed in ref. [10]. related

work in the supergravity case has been given in [11].

2

(i) the nature of the massless gravitino in the presence of several fterms2 on

dierent walls that cancel and lead to unbroken supersymmetry

(ii) the identication of the goldstino in the case of broken supersymmetry.

the rst question (i) arises because of a particular nonlocal eect of supersym-

metry breakdown rst observed by horava [5]. a given source of supersymmetry

breakdown (parametrized by a vacuum expectation value (vev) of an auxiliary
eld f ) on one wall could be compensated by a similar but opposite value (f )
on another (separated) wall. any calculation and approximation of the system

thus has to reproduce this behaviour. the previously mentioned averaging pro-

ceedure over the bulk distance does this in a trivial way, leading to unbroken

supersymmetry as expected. a detailed inspection of the gravitino, however, re-

veals a problem.

if we start with the situation f = 0 it is easy to dene the

massless gravitino 0 in the d = 4 theory. switching on a nontrivial f on one
brane and (f ) on the other still should give a massless gravitino, but 0 turns
out to be no longer a mass eigenstate. the resolution of this problem and the

correct identication of the gravitino will be given in section 3. it is a particular

combination of the possible gravitini that appear when one, for example, reduces

a 5-dimensional theory to a theory in d = 4 on a nite d = 5 interval. the

theory on a d = 5 circle would lead to n = 2 supersymmetry in d = 4 and two

massless gravitini (zero modes on the circle). the z2 projection on the interval
removes one of the gravitini and is n = 1 supersymmetric. a nonvanishing vev

of f now interferes with the boundary conditions and the massless gravitino will

be a linear combination of the zero mode and all the excited kk modes whose

coecients will depend on f (assuming, of course, unbroken supersymmetry due
to a compensating vev f on another wall).

the second question (ii) deals with the nature of the goldstino (i.e. the lon-

gitudinal components of the gravitino) in the case of broken supersymmetry.

remember that the simplied averaging proceedure leads to a goldstino that cor-

responds to the lowest kaluzaklein mode 0 of a higher-dimensional bulk eld
. inspecting the gravitino mass matrix in this case reveals the fact that this eld

0 is not a mass eigenstate, but mixes with innitely many higher kaluzaklein
2in this paper we generically use the notation fterm for the source of supersymmetry
breakdown. depending on the specic situation this could represent a dterm or a gaugino
condensate as well.

modes n. a consistent manifestation of a superhiggs mechanism would re-
quire a diagonalization of this mass matrix and an identication of the goldstino.

this problem, that has not yet been addressed in the literature, will be solved in

section 4.

this resolution of the puzzles claries some of the other questions of the

approach.

 the nonlocality of the breakdown shows some resemblance to the break-
down of supersymmetry via the scherkschwarz [12] mechanism. here,

however, the real goldstino of the spontaneous breakdown of supersymme-

try can be unambiguously identied.

 the possibility to cancel the supersymmetry breakdown on a distant wall
by a vev on the local wall tells us, that the mass splittings of broken super-

symmetry have to be of order of the gravitino mass m3/2 on both walls.

 in terms of the physical quantities there is no real extra suppression, once
we separate the walls by a large distance r. in the limit r   we will
have mplanck   as well. the suppression of the soft breaking parameters
will always be gravitational, as given in (2).

 in general, when we have a system of many separated branes with potential
sources of supersymmetry breakdown, the actual breakdown will be ob-

tained by the sum of these contributions. the averaging proceedure will be

very useful to decide whether supersymmetry is broken or not. the iden-

tication of the goldstino, however, is more dicult and requires a careful

calculation.

 a successful implementation of the superhiggs mechanism will require
some elds other than gravitino and graviton in the bulk3. this implies that

in the absence of such elds (as has been considered in [14]) a consistent

spontaneous breakdown of supergravity might not be achieved.

in the following sections we will show how the goldstino and gravitino can be

dened in the correct way. we shall do the explicit calculations in the framework

of the heterotic m-theory, although a similar calculation will apply under more

3usually they arise as modes of the higher dimensional supergravity multiplet.

4

general circumstances (like the inclusion of 5-branes or the consideration of multi-

d-brane systems in type i theory), which we shall briey discuss in section 5. as

the source of supersymmetry we consider the mechanism of gaugino condensation.

again this just should represent a generic breakdown of supersymmetry in this

specic example.

10dimensional boundaries (walls) of the space. the rst integral describes the

supergravity in the 11dimensional bulk while the second one describes interac-

tions with the super yangmills elds living on two 10dimensional walls. our
signature is (, +, . . . , +). in the above lagrangian only the two rst terms in the
long wavelength expansion are kept. they are of relative order 2/3. all higher
order terms (order 4/3 or higher) will be consistently dropped in this paper.

we work in the upstairs approach in which the 11dimensional integrals are

dened as

z d11x =

and we use the z2 symmetry conditions4 :

a(x11) = +11a(x11)
11(x11) = 1111(x11)
gabcd(x11) =  gabcd(x11)
gbcd11(x11) = + gbcd11(x11)

imposing su(3) invariance on calabiyau reduces this number to 8

ponents.

components  they can be assembled into two sets with 4 components each dis-

tinguished by 10-dimensional chirality. some of the formulae given below are valid

only after imposing su(3) invariance but we treat all spinors as 11dimensional

along the way. only at the very end, after compactication to 4 dimensions we

assemble each set into a 4dimensional majorana spinor to give the nal formula

for the eective 4dimensional action for spinors.

this theory is dened in 11 dimensions (3) so 7 dimensions must be compact.
the spacetime is given (in the lowest approximation) by the product: m 4  x 6
s1/z2 where x 6 is a calabiyau manifold and s1/z2 is the interval between the
two walls. for simplicity we will use a truncation and reduction method [15, 6, 7]

instead of compatifying on a calabiyau manifold. the 11dimensional metric

is given in this case by

(7)

at order 2/3 the moduli  and  depend linearly on x11 and the 11dimensional

spacetime is no longer a direct product of the three factors.

4in the downstairs approach we would use

z d11x =z

dx11z d10x

and the appropriate boundary conditions instead of z2 symmetry.

let us now describe a process of reduction of the theory to 4 dimensions. we

will be mainly interested in the fermion elds since our main goal is to identify

the 4dimensional (massless or massive, depending on supersymmetry breaking)

gravitino.

it turns out that in the resulting lagrangian all the fermion elds

are mixed. to diagonalize that lagrangian one has to make a number of eld

redenitions. in order to make the result of the calculation more transparent we

will perform the appropriate redenitions (necessary to get the nal result in a

diagonal form) step by step.

let us start with the following redenition of the gravitino elds

therefore the zero modes are possible only for +
implicit dependence on x and we will often omit x11 dependence of the elds.

11. all elds have an

 and 

let us now consider switching on vev of the tensor eld g. as explained in
[2] due to the nonzero r.h.s. of eq. (6) elds gabcd (where a, . . . are holomorphic
and a, . . . are antiholomorphic indices on x 6) acquire nonzero vev satisfying

habcd gabcdi =

on any su(3) invariant spinor  (with arbitrary chirality). the parameter  is

given by

abcd gabcd = 4abcd gabcd =  .

(13)

in the case of unbroken supersymmetry there is a relation between  and the
slopes of (x11) and (x11) [2, 7]:

11 = 11 =

 (x11)

(14)

in order to get the canonical kinetic terms for g we make the following redef-

initions:

gaabb = e/2e3 gaabb 
g11abc = e3/2e3/2g11abc
g11abc = e3/2e3/2g11abc

11!

(15)

the unusual additional terms in the redenition of gaabb are necessary to cancel
some of the fermion nondiagonal terms (as will be shown after eq. (17)).

in this paper we keep track of only (2,2,0), (3,0,1) and (0,3,1) components of

< g >. it was shown by witten [2] that the presence of the vacuum expectation

value for the (2,2,0) component of g does not break supersymmetry when the
fuctions  and  have denite dependence on x11 (see eq. (14)). the presence

of the (3,0,1) and (0,3,1) components of < g > located on the walls generically

breaks supersymmetry and in the next section we will provide the explicit formula

for the mass of the gravitino, its expansion in the kaluzaklein modes and the

disappearance of one spin 1/2 state (superhiggs mechanism). in this section we

will consider the case of unbroken supersymmetry discussed by horava [5]. we

now need the couplings of < g > to the fermion elds

terms with the fermion elds in the above formula are necessary to cancel some

of the nondiagonal terms coming from (9) and (16).

with all these redenitions we are now ready to evaluate the sum of (9), (16)
and (17) with the vacuum expectation value for gabcd (12)  it is the nal result
for the case considered by witten. using also (14) and (15) we get the following

where the coecients of the expansion depend only on x (so they correspond to

4dimensional spinor elds).

9

substituting this into eq. (18) and integrating over x11 we can see that 0+

and 0
11 are massless  therefore they correspond to the 4dimensional gravitino
and the massless spin 1/2 fermion elds. the remaining elds form the usual

innite tower of kk modes with masses equal to n/. this is very similar to the

standard kaluzaklein reduction. the only dierence is that we had to redene
the tensor eld g (15) in order to remove some nondiagonal kinetic terms from
the lagrangian.

let us now include a nonvanishing vev of gabc11 and gabc11 elds. such vevs
can be generated for example by condensation of gaugino elds living on the
walls. in such a case the vev of gabc11 on the wall at x11 = 0 is given by:

hgabc11i =

2
16 (cid:18) 

4(cid:19)2/3

(cid:16)x11(cid:17)habci

(20)

an analogous formula holds for gabc11 and other walls.

in the case of two walls the most general formula reads:

hgabc11i = abchg+(cid:16)(x11) + (x11  )(cid:17) + g(cid:16)(x11)  (x11  )(cid:17)i

(21)

horava [5] discussed the case when the supersymmetry remains unbroken i.e.

when g+ = 0. let us try to see one manifestation of the unbroken supersymmetry
i.e. the massless gravitino in terms of the usual kk modes. using the fourier

expansion (19) and putting the nonzero vev g into eqs. (16) and (17) we get

terms which mix dierent modes

and . . . stand for the (quite complicated and nondiagonal spin 3/2 and spin 1/2)

mass terms involving only the nonconstant kk modes. one can see that the
constant modes 0+
11 would be no longer massless after compactication
to 4 dimensions. but the supersymmetry is unbroken and there should be the

 and 0

massless gravitino in the spectrum. one can obtain the fermions with denite

masses by diagonalization of the mass terms. this, however, requires a very

tedious calculation.

10

it turns out that it is possible to identify the massless states in a much simpler

way. before calculating the mass terms for fermions we perform a rotation of the

elds  and 11:

where

  (cid:16)1 + f (x11)y(cid:17) 
11  (cid:16)1  f (x11)y(cid:17) 11

f (x11) =

8

g(x11)

(24)

(25)

such a rotation makes the new zero mode a combination of the old zero mode

and innitely many excited kk modes. evaluating the eect of (21) on (16) and

taking into account the redenition (24) we recover the lagrangian (18) but now

in terms of the new elds. hence the lagrangian (18) is the nal result in the case

considered by horava (but the elds are those obtained after the rotation (24)).
therefore, the zero modes of the rotated elds +

11 are now the massless

 and 

gravitino and the massless spin 1/2 elds.

(26)

these elds are dierent from the constant modes which were massless in the

case with vanishing g. this change of the massless fermions reects the fact
that the unbroken supersymmetry changes5 when we change the value of g.

4 the superhiggs mechanism

in order to break the supersymmetry in this scenario we have to assume that the
condensates on opposite walls do not cancel (g+ 6= 0 in the formula (21)). in
this case the fermion mass matrix is even more complicated than in the case with

only g nonzero. the procedure of diagonalization is very tedious but it turns

5 the unbroken supersymmetry corresponds to the spinor parameter  which depends on

the compact coordinates. that dependence changes with the value of g.

11

out that, as before, it is much simpler to work in the 5dimensional language.

we can rotate the elds in the similar way as in (24):

  (cid:16)1 + f (x11)y(cid:17) 
11  (cid:16)1  f (x11)y(cid:17) 11

a remark is in order here: the formula for the gravitino mass (30) is the

same as in the naive approach (just taking the zero mode and not performing
the rotation (27)). this mass is already a 2/3 eect, so corrections of the next
order in 2/3 (or inversely proportional to m11) must be dropped. in general we

12

could expect other corrections which should be kept e.g. proportional to  
m 1
it turns out that no such corrections come from the proper
diagonalization of the mass matrix. on the other hand, we nd corrections to

11 . however,

the composition of the mass eigenstates (in perturbation theory corrections to

the eigenfunctions are ususally more dicult to obtain than corrections to the

eigenvalues).

let us now discuss the superhiggs eect which should take place when su-

persymmetry is spontaneously broken as in the present case. in the lagrangian

(29) there are many terms containing both the gravitino and the goldstino elds.

there should exist a way of eating the massless goldstino and leaving only the

massive gravitino. and indeed let us dene

then as a part of (29) we obtain a lagrangian for the massive gravitino

and the eld goldstino
superhiggs eect since the goldstino provided the degrees of freedom needed for

completely disappears from (29). this is precisely the

11

the massless gravitino to become massive.

in the case with the gaugino condensate present only at the hidden wall the

gravitino mass is given by

m3/2 =

we need the scale of the condensate  to be of the order 1014 gev to get the

gravitino mass of about 1 tev. if we assume that  is not bigger than the gut
scale (1016 gev) then we obtain the upper bound on the gravitino mass of the
order of 105 tev. a value of  much larger than the gut scale (which is com-

parable to the 11-dimensional planck scale m11) will not be meaningful in this
framework.

in the above we have shown how to identify the gravitino and goldstino elds

in the case with arbitrary gaugino condensates at two 10dimensional walls of

13

the 11dimensional spacetime. this procedure can be easily generalized to more

complicated situations. we can analyse, for example, a model in which supersym-

metry breaking sources are present not only at the walls but also at some branes

located along the eleventh dimension interval. in this case we have to perform a
eld redenition similar to the rotation (27) but with modied function f (x11)

and/or matrix y . those modications should be chosen in such a way that
the terms containing 11 present in the lagrangian (18) exactly cancel (locally)
all like sources of supersymmetry breaking. an additional constraint on the
function f comes from the z2 symmetry and relates its values at x11 =  and
x11 = +. to fulll such a constraint we generally have to add a linear part to

f (like in (28)). the compactication to 4 dimensions is quite straightforward

in terms of the rotated elds because the kk modes of those elds are the mass

eigenstates. the linear term in f gives rise to the gravitino mass after compact-

ication to 4 dimensions. this mass is zero (and supersymmetry is unbroken)

only if all the sources add up to zero.

let us now compare the above discussed mechanism of supersymmetry break-

ing to the scherkschwarz mechanism [12]. there is one similarity: in both cases

the 4dimensional elds (for example the gravitino) are obtained from higher di-

mensional elds with nontrivial dependence on the compact coordinate(s). but

the origin of this dependence is very dierent. in the scherkschwarz mechanism

we just assume some specic dependence or, in other words, we keep only one

(nonconstant) kk mode and drop all the other kk modes (also the constant one).

the mass of the gravitino is equal to this kk mass and as a result supersymmetry

is explicitly broken. in this paper, on the contrary, we keep all the kk modes.

they mix due to the supersymmetry breaking sources (like a vev of g) and we

identify the gravitino as the lightest mass eigenstate with spin 3/2. supersym-

metry is broken spontaneously and the goldstino is eaten by the superhiggs

mechanism as was shown explicitly in the previous section. it is thus possible to

take into account eects of other (heavier) spin 3/2 states. the mechanism is

motivated by the dynamics of the higher dimensional theory. modied bianchi

identities and the perfect square structure in the lagrangian provide justication

for the nontrivial background of the g eld. in this background we are able to

perform explicit calculations identifying the lowestlying gravitino and all the

heavier states.
