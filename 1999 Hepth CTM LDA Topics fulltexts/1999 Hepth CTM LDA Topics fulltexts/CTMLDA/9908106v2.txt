abstract

this is a short note on the relation of the matrix model with the non-commutative
geometry of the 11-dimensional supermembrane. we put forward the idea that m-
theory is described by the t hooft topological expansion of the matrix model in
the large nlimit where all topologies of membranes appear. this expansion can
faithfully be represented by the moyal yang-mills theory of membranes. we discuss
this conjecture in the case of nite n , where the non-commutative geometry of the
membrane is given be the nite quantum mechanics. the use of the nite dimensional
representations of the heisenberg group reveals the cellular structure of a toroidal
supermembrane on which the matrix model appears as a noncommutatutive yang
mills theory. the moyal star product on the space of functions in the case of rational
values of the planck constant  represents exactly this cellular structure. we also
discuss the integrability of the instanton sector as well as the topological charge and
the corresponding bogomolnyi bound.

introduction

2

one of the basic ingredients of mthreory[1, 2] is the eleven dimensional (11-d) superme-
mbrane for which some years ago[3] a consistent action has been written in a general back-
ground of 11-d supergravity. the supermembrane has a uniquely dened selfinteraction,
which comes in contrast to the superstring, from a innite dimensional gauge symmetry
apparent in the light-cone gauge as the area-preserving dieomorphisms on the surface of
the membrane.

because of the absence of the dilaton eld for the supermembrane, there is no topological
expansion over all possible three manifolds analogous to the string case. the supermem-
brane, due to its unique self-interaction, is possible to break into other supermembranes
so in a sense is already a second quantized theory but up to now there is no consistent
perturbative expansion. in the light-cone gauge, and at space-time, there are two classes
of membrane vacua, points and tensionless strings, so a lowenergy eective eld theory of
supermembrane massless excitations would be either eleven-dimensional supergravity or a
eld theory for tensionless strings. hopefully, recent eorts for understanding the coupling
of 11-d supergravity with the supermembrane will help to the construction of its eective
low energy eld theory[4].

in this letter, we present arguments that the matrix model [5, 6, 7] describes the non-
commutative geometry of the 11-d supermembrane, and m theory is the t hooft topological
expansion of the matrix model. we demostrate the existence of a topological charge and
the corresponding bogomolnyi bound and we discuss the integrability of the instanton
sector.

2. non-commutative geometry of the membrane

it is a well known fact that the matrix model[5, 6, 7] was one of the rst ideas for
the study of the dynamics of the bosonic membrane in the light-cone frame and in the
approximation of nite number of oscillation modes [8, 9]. the true dynamics would be
determined by taking the limit of innite number of modes. in the nite mode approxima-
tion the hamiltonian of the membrane is exactly the same with su(n) yang-mills (ym)
classical mechanics and this system is known to possess interesting chaotic dynamics[10]
and a discrete spectrum at the level of quantum mechanics (qm) [11]. later on, townsend
et al[3, 12] discovered the supermembrane lagrangian in 11 dimensions and the nite
mode truncation, as was expected, is described by the hamiltonian of the supersymmetric
su(n) ym mechanics. it was found that the quantum mechanical spectrum of this model
is continuous; at that time this was considered to be the end of the supermembrane as
a fundamendal object replacing the superstring and producing all the low energy physics
that could be useful for the unication of gauge and gravitational forces [13, 14].

in ref. [15] the question of a deeper origin of the su(n) ym classical mechanics as an
approximation of the membrane dynamics was considered and it was found that su(n) rep-
resents the lie algebra of the nite heisenberg group, which acts on a discretized membrane

3

representing a toroidal discrete phase space. the membrane coordinates are approximated
by n  n matrices (ym gauge elds), which represent collectively n 2 number of points in
the target space. the large nlimit to reproduce the continuous surface of the membrane,
should be such that all the positions of the su(n) matrices are lled up in a continuous way
and this limit has not been expressed, up to now, in a mathematically consistent way [16].
the non-commutative geometry of the discrete membrane is generated by the nite and
discrete heisenberg group and the space of functions on the surface of the membrane is the
algebra of n  n complex matrices.

in modern language [17] the su(n) ym classical mechanics is the ym theory on non-
commutative 2-torus. it is interesting that the torus compactied matrix model is equiv-
alent with the mtheory compactication in a constant antisymmetric background gauge
eld.
in this case, the matrix model description becomes that of a gauge theory on a
noncommutative torus[17, 18, 19, 20, 21].

it is well known that the usual quantum mechanics can be represented on functions
of the phase-space variables, with the moyal bracket[22]1 replacing the classical poisson
bracket. recently the vertex operators of open strings in an external antisymmetric gauge
eld b were found to obey non-commutative relations of the weyl type, which induces a
moyal bracket structure on the space of functions on the string momenta [25]2.

3. the heisenberg-weyl group and the moyal bracket

to start with, we introduce the irreducible representations of the nite heisenberg group
appropriate for the matrix model non-commutative geometry of a toroidal membrane.
the hilbert space h of the wave functions on the torus  = c/l of complex modulus
 = 1 + 2, where l is the integer lattice, l = {m1 +  m2|(m1, m2)  z  z} is dened
as the space of functions of complex argument z = x + y:

f (z) = xnz

cnen2 +2nz

with norm

||f||2 = z e2y2/2|f (z)|2dxdy, 2 > 0.

(1)

(2)

consider the subspace hn () of h with periodic fourier coecients {cn}nz of period n:
(3)

cn = cn+n n  z, n  n.

the space hn () is n-dimensional and there is a discrete heisenberg group, with generators
s1/n and t1 acting as [27, 28]

(s1/n f )(z) = xnz

cne2n/n e2nz+n2

1for a recent discussion see [23, 24] and references therein.
2for recent discussions see[26].

4

(t1f )(z) = xnz

cn1e2nz+n2 , cn  c.

(4)

on the n-dimensional subspace of vectors (c1, . . . , cn ) the two generators are represented
by n  n matrices, q, p

(s1/n )n1,n2 = qn1,n2 = (n11)n1,n2, (t1)n1,n2 = pn1,n2 = n11,n2,

with  = exp(2/n). they satisfy the weyl relation qp = p q.

the heisenberg group elements are dened as

(5)

(6)

jr,s = rs/2p rqs.
r,s = jr,s and periodic with period n, i.e. j n
these n  n matrices are unitary j 
they realize a projective representation of the discrete translation group zn  zn :

r,s = 1.

jr,sjr,s = (rsrs)/2jr+r,s+s

(7)

in ref[5] the nite n-matrix model is considered as a non-commutative qm system (see
also [15]), but the canonical commutation relations were not represented through the nite
heisenberg group basis jr,s. it is possible to dene nite dimensional matrices p, q such
that q = eq and p = ep

qij =

2
n

(s + 1  i)ij, pij =  

n

(1)(ij)
sin 
n (ij)

(8)

where n = 2s + 1 and s is an integer. here we have shifted by s rows and columns of q and
p matrices dened in relations (5). these matrices satisfy new heisenberg commutation
relations, which have a very simple form[29]

 [q, p]ij =

2
n



n (i  j)(1)(ij)

sin 

n (i  j)

(9)

when i 6= j and zero when i = j. the matrix q satises the torus compactication relations
of the matrix model, with corrections due to their nite size

p 1 qp = q +

2
n

in  2i0,

(10)

where in is the n  n identity matrix and i0 the n  n diagonal matrix with diagonal
elements {1, 0, . . . , 0}.

the bosonic part of the matrix model is the su(n) ym classical mechanics and the

gauge elds are linear combinations of the elements jr,s, i.e.,

al(t) =

n 1

xr,s=0

ar,s

l jr,s,

l = 1, . . . , d  1

(11)

5

which can be considered as coherent states of the discrete and nite toroidal phase-space
n  n lattice. the al matrices are the non-commutative coordinates of the discrete
membrane in d  1 dimensions.

there is another representation of the standard quantum mechanics on the space of
functions of the phase-space variables. this is the unique deformation of the poisson
bracket, the moyal bracket [22, 24]

{{f, g}}(u, v) =

1


sin ( (uv  uv)) f (u, v)g(u, v)|u=u,v=v

(12)

here,  corresponds to the planck constant and the moyal bracket gives a structure of
innite dimensional algebra on the space of functions on the torus generated by

er,s(u, v) =

1
2

e(ru+sv)

(13)

where u, v  [0, 2] and r, s  z. this algebra is the trigonometric algebra of fairlie
fletcher and zachos[30]:

{{er,s, er,s}}(u, v) =

1

2

sin ( (rs  rs)) er+r,s+s(u, v)

(14)

which also icludes the case  = 2

n . this case gives the su(n) algebra in the base jr,s:

[jr,s,jr,s] = 2 sin(cid:18) 2

n

(rs  rs)(cid:19)jr+r,s+s

(15)

if the er,s functions are identied with er+kn,s+mn for k, m  z. the heisenberg group
matrices jr,s have been introduced by weyl.

when   0 (or n  ), we recover the poisson algebra of the area preserving

transformations of the torus [31]

{er,s, er,s}(u, v) = (rs  rs)

1
2

er+r,s+s.

(16)

the matrix model has various large nlimits. up to now it is not known how to get
the quantum mechanics of supermembrane starting from this model, even though, various
compactications indicate that it has membrane states as excitations. we believe that
the appropriate limit is the t hooft topological expansion of the su(n) ymmechanics.
to this end, we shall determine what happens to the heisenberg group matrices jr,s in
this limit. we observe that these matrices contain powers of the root of unity along two
diagonals so we start with  = e2 m
n , (m, n co-prime integers). the correct large nlimit
for su(n) is the inductive one, i.e., su(n)  su(n + 1)  su(n + 2) . . . which we
get if we let m, n   with m/n = constant. note that the constant  = 2 m
n can
be identied with the ux of the 3-index antisymmetric gauge eld per unit membrane
area. the weyl relations become the heisenberg group relations for an innite phase-space
lattice and in the fourier transform space of both canonical variables the matrix model

6

describes a toroidal continuous membrane with matrix commutators replaced by moyal
brackets [32]. since the limit   0 replaces the moyal bracket by poisson, we get from
moyal ym theory the membrane. higher order corrections to  can be represented as
membranes with attached handles on the initial membrane which is determined by the
su(n) chosen basis, in our case the torus.

in this limit, the light-cone gauge equations of motion for the membrane

xi = {xk,{xk, xi}};

i, k = 1, . . . , d  1

and the corresponding gauss law {xi,

xi} = 0 are replaced by
xi = {{xk,{{xk, xi}} }}
i, k = 1, . . . d  1.

xi}} = 0,

{{xi,

(17)

(18)

(19)

when the space of functions on the toroidal membrane is replaced by the algebra of
n n matrices, the coordinates of the membrane become the matrices ai(t), the velocity is
the su(n) electric eld ei(t) = ai(t), and the magnetic eld in three or seven dimensions is
bi(t) = 1
2fijk[aj, ak] where fijk is the ijk totally antisymmetric symbol in three dimensions
and ijk the octonionic multiplication table in seven dimensions [33].

the moyal bracket generalizes both poisson brackets and matrix commutators, so that
one is tempted to consider a system where the poisson bracket is replaced by the moyal
one [34]. the question of the appearance of moyal bracket for physical reasons in the
dynamics of membrane is up to now open. we know that there are other limits of the
matrix model, one leads to perturbative string eld theory [35, 36], and the poisson limit in
which the su(n) symmetry becomes the area-preserving dieomorphism group. we believe
that the physical origin of the moyal bracket is due to the presence of the antisymmetric
background eld cijk in the light-cone gauge which gives a magnetic ux (hall eect),
trasforming the surface of the membrane into a non-commutative phasespace[37]. this is
true for open membranes where the topological term of the action receives a contribution
from the boundary.

4. topological charge, bogomolnyi bound and integrability.

in order to explain the appearance of non-abelian electric-magnetic type of duality in
the membrane theory, we recall that for ympotentials independent of space coordinates
the self-duality equation in the gauge a0 = 0 is

ai =

1
2

ijk[aj, ak], i, j, k = 1, 2, 3

(20)

according to ref[38] the only non-trivial higher dimensional ym self-duality equations exist
in 8 space-time dimensions which, for the 7-space coordinate independent potentials, can
be written (in the a0 = 0 gauge) as

ai =

1
2

ijk[aj, ak], i, j, k = 1,   7

(21)

7

where ijk is the multiplication table of the seven imaginary octonionic units.

it is now tempting to take the large n-limit and replace the commutators by poisson
(moyal) brackets to obtain the self-duality equations for membranes (non-commutative
instantons for the moyal case).
in this limit we replace the gauge potentials ai by the
membrane coordinates xi. then, the 3-d system is[39, 40],

xi =

1
2

ijk{xj, xk}, i, j, k = 1, 2, 3,

while in seven space dimensions [34, 41]

xi =

1
2

ijk{xj, xk}, i, j, k = 1,   , 7

(22)

(23)

and correspondingly for the case of moyal brackets in three dimensions[42, 43] and in seven
dimensions[24]. it is easy to see that the self-duality membrane equations, imply the second
order euclidean-time, equations of motion in the light-cone gauge as well as the gauss law.

one striking feature of the self-duality membrane equations is their simple geometrical
meaning[39, 41]. these equations state that the normal vector at a point of the membrane
surface and the velocity at the same point are parallel (self-dual) or antiparallel (anti-self-
dual). the possibility to write down self-duality equations based on the existence of vector
cross-product comes from the existence of the quaternionic and octonionic algebras. since
these are the only existing division algebras the 3 and 7 dimensions are unique[33]3. the
validity of this geometrical statement could be extended in a general curved space-time
background as a denition of the self-dual membranes.

if one takes the limit where the commutator of matrices is replaced by commutator of
operators or the moyal bracket, then the self-duality equations become the moyal nahm
or moyal-bogomolnyi equations of [34].

the membrane instantons carry a topological charge density [45] which satises a bo-

gomolnyi bound [46]:

(x) =

1
3!

abcfijkx i

c

ax j

b x k

(24)

a = ax i, a, b, c = 1, 2, 3 and fijk = ijk when i, j, k = 1, 2, 3 and fijk = ijk
where x i
for i, j, k = 1,   , 7. this topological charge density denes the topological charge of the
membrane

q =

1

v3 z d3(x)

(25)

where v3 is the volume of the integration region. the topological charge q is an integer and
represents the degree of the map from the membrane to its world volume. we display below
the convenient representation of the topological charge which will help us demonstrate that
it is a lower bound of the membrane action for topologically non-trivial membranes

(x) =

1
2

xifijk{x j, x k} =

1
2{x j, x k}2

(26)

3for other approach to self-duality see also[44].

8

where the self-duality equations as well as the properties of fijk in three and seven di-
mensions have been used. the topological charge of the membrane can now be written
as

q =

1

2v3 zm

d3{x j, x k}2

(27)

the minimum value of q (q = 1) is obtained for the membrane instanton compactied on
a worldvolume torus, x1 = 21, x2 = 22 and x3 = 2t.

the euclidean action can be written as

s =

x 2

i +

2

from the inequality ( xi  1

1

1

v3 z d3(cid:18) 1

4{xj, xk}2(cid:19)
2 fijk{xj, xk})2  0 we derive that,

s  q

(28)

(29)

and the equality holds only for the self-dual or anti-self-dual membranes. so the self-dual or
anti-self-dual membranes are bps euclidean-time membrane world-volume solitons. as we
have seen in ref[47], the 3d and 7-d self-dual solutions preserve 8 and 1 supersymmetries
respectively or 1/2 and 1/16th of the supersymmetry of the light-cone supermembrane
hamiltonian. this is a direct consequence of the above bogomolnyi bound and the so(3)
and g2 rotational space symmetry of the above cases.

the role of the membrane instantons is important in developing a perturbative ex-
pansion. congurations of the membrane around instantons cannot collapse to points or
strings, because they have dierent topological charge. the 3-index antisymmetric gauge
eld which is so crucial for the uniqueness of the supermembrane lagrangian participates
in the bosonic part through the cern-simons term.
if its vacuum expectation value is
non-zro and proportional to ijk (in the corresponding 7 dimensions), then the topological
charge dened above, separates the functional integral into membrane topological sectors.
going now to the case of moyal-nahm equations, there is a corresponding topological
charge without an obvious geometrical meaning and the bogomolnyi bound is valid in
this case too. this bound is important for the stability of the corresponding moyal-nahm
instantons. recent discussions on the role of instantons in non-commutative ym theories
(non-commutative instantons) imply that they can be considered as regularizations of small
size instantons in standard ym theories (see e.g. [48]). the case of moyal-nahm equations
could be considered as non-commutative membrane instantons which regularize the poisson
or membrane case.

we now make few remarks on the integrability of the self-dual equations. the 3-d self-
duality system has a lax pair and an innite number of conservation laws [39, 40]. in order
to see this, we rst rewrite the self-duality equations in the form

x+ = i{x3, x+},

x = i{x3, x},

x3 =

1
2

i{x+, x},

(30)

where

9

x = x1  ix2

the lax pair equations can be written as

 = lx3+x,

 = l 1

 x+x3,

where the dierential operators lf are dened as

lf  i(cid:18) f





 cos  

f

 cos 



(cid:19) .

the compatibility condition of (32) is

[t  lx3+x, t  l 1

 x+x3] = 0,

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

from which, comparing the two sides for the coecients of the powers 1
, 0, 1 of the
spectral parameter , we nd (30). from the linear system (32), using the inversescattering
method, one could in principle construct all solutions of the self-duality equations.

the innite number of conservation laws are derived as follows:

from the cartesian

formulation

dxi
dt

=

1
2

ijk{xj, xk}

contracting with a complex 3-vector ui such that

ui = ijkujvk,

(35)

(36)

where uiui = 0, and v is another complex vector with vivi = 1 and uivi = 0, we nd,

du  x
dt

= {u  x, v  x}

the latter is a lax pair type equation, which implies

d

dt z d2(u  x)n = 0

(37)

(38)

applying the same method in seven dimensions with two complex 7-vectors ui, vi such

that uiui = 0, vivi = 1 and uivi = 0, leads to the equation

du  x
dt

= {u  x, v  x} +

1
2

jklmujvk{xl, xm}

(39)

the curvature tensor jklm is dened as the dual of ijk in seven dimensions. when
equation (39) is restricted to three dimensions we recover (37). we observe that the presence
of the curvature tensor is an obstacle for the integrability. at this point, we may look
for an extended denition of integrability replacing the zero-curvature condition with the

10

octonionic curvature one. we can restrict the above equation in particular subspaces of
solutions where integrability appears. one possibility is the factorization of the time [41].

we conclude with a few remarks. in this note we have given arguments that the matrix
model describes a non-commutative ym theory for the supermembrane in the presence of
background three-index antisymmetric gauge elds. if this conjecture is true, it implies
that the excitations of this model in various compactications are also physical excitations
of the supermembrane. so the supermembrane should contain 11-d supergravity at least in
weak coupling limits given by small radii of the compactication manifolds. it is tempting
to calculate correlation functions of membrane observables using the matrix model and
then take the large n-limit as was discussed in section 3. on the other hand, perturbation
theory for the supermembrane could be dened through the expansion in the parameter
/n, with m/n   for m, n  . in this expansion all the topologies of the membrane
appear as splitting and joining interactions the other known large nlimit [35, 36] gives
the string perturbation theory as a qm sector of the supermembrane.

as this work was written, we have been kindly informed that the moyal limit of the
matrix model has been studied in connection with the higher derivative corrections to
the born-infeld lagrangians for the d2brane[49]. for a very recent, interesting paper on
dbranes in group manifolds, see[50]

one of us (egf) would like to thank prof. albert schwarz for a valuable discussion.
