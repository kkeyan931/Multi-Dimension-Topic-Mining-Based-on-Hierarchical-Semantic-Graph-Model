abstract

in the microcanonical ensemble for string theory on adsm  sn, there is a
phase transition between a black hole solution extended over the sn and a
solution localized on the sn if the adsm has the topology r2  sm2. the
phase transition will not appear if the adsm has the topology r2  t m2,
that is, when the adsm  sn geometry is regarded as arising from the near-
horizon limit of a black m  2 brane. in this paper, we argue that when the
black branes are rotating, the localization phase transition will occur between
some rotating d-branes and corresponding kerr black holes when the angular
momentum reaches its critical value.

the maldacenas conjure [1] asserts that string/m theory on anti-de sitter (ads) (times
a compact space) is dual to certain large n conformal eld theory living on the boundary
of the ads (for a recent review see [2]). thus some questions concerning large n gauge
theories may be answered via supergravity. indeed, one can use this duality to calculate
the correlation functions of gauge theory [3,4], and to study thermodynamics and phase
structure of the strong coupling gauge theory [513].

recently, banks, douglas, horowitz and martinec [14] argued that in the microcanonical
ensemble for string theory on adsm  sn, there is a phase transition between a black hole
solution extended on the sn and a solution localized on the sn, which is associated with
the gregory-laamme instability (localization instability) of black strings and p-branes [15].
this phase transition arises as follows. at high energies, the typical state is a schwarzschild-
ads black hole with a constant radius sphere sn; at lower energies, where the horizon radius
is smaller than the cosmological scale, the typical state becomes a schwarzschild black hole
in m + n dimensions. that is, the black hole will localize on the sphere sn. as shown by
hawking and page [16], a large mass schwarzschild black hole in ads space has positive heat
capacity, while a small mass black hole has negative heat capacity. this implies that in the
canonical ensemble the small mass black hole is unstable. however, in the microcanonical
ensemble this instability is absent. instead the system enters into a new phase, in which
the black hole localize on the sphere sn, because the schwarzschild black hole in m + n
dimensions has larger entropy than the equal mass schwarzschild-ads black hole.

more recently, peet and ross [17] found that there is a subtlety in the above localization
phase transition. they showed that the existence of the phase transition crucially depends
on the spatial boundary condition (topology) of the adsm space. the above transition
exists when the adsm has topology r2  sm2. if one thinks of the adsm  sn geometry as
arising from the near-horizon limit of some m  2 brane, this localization phase transition
does not occur: at the lower energies, the state is still the schwarzschild-ads black hole.
in this case, the adsm space has topology r2  t m2 or its large volume limit r2  rm2.
this is associated with the fact that in contrast to the usual schwarzschild-ads black hole,
the so-called topological black holes in ads space always have positive heat capacity [18].
this implies that this localization instability does not appear as well for other higher genus
topological manifold m2

such that the adsm has topology r2  m2

as is well known, the near-horizon geometries of the d3-brane, d1-d5-brane, m2-brane
and m5-brane typically have structures ads5s5, ads3s3, ads4s7 and ads7s4, and
the adsm has the topology r2 t m2. therefore, the localization phase transition does not
take place on these branes. in the present paper, we are going to consider minor extension
of them, that is, rotating d3-branes, m5-branes and m2-branes. in [19] gubser showed that
the low energy excitation of the rotating black d3-branes is thermodynamically stable up
to a critical angular momentum density and a eld theory model can correctly predict this
critical limit. in a previous paper, in the canonical ensemble and grand canonical ensemble
we investigated this critical behavior in the rotating d3-branes, m2-branes and m5-branes
and found that the their heat capacity will become negative when the angular momentum
is beyond a certain critical value [20]. this leads us to suspect that in the microcanonical
ensemble the above localization phase transition may occur in the rotating branes. indeed,
as we will show shortly, at the large angular momentum regime, a typical state should be a
kerr black hole, which has a larger entropy than the corresponding rotating black brane.

2

let us begin our discussion with the rotating black d3-brane in the type iib supergravity.
the rotating black d3-brane solution has been given in [2123]. in general, the black d3-
brane solution may have three angular momentum parameters. for our purpose, however,
it is sucient to consider that only a single angular momentum parameter non-vanishes. in
this case, the metric is

the extremal limit of the solution is approached by letting m  0. quite interesting is to
note that the extremal limit of the solution (1) can be interpreted as some superposition of
n static d3-branes, other than that of n coinciding rotating d3-branes [24]. near-extremal
limit, some thermodynamic quantities of the black three-branes was given in [20]:

e = 532mv,
j = 7/43/2n 1/2m1/2lv,
 = 5/41/2n 1/2m1/2lr2

here e denotes the energy of excitations which equals the adm mass of the black three-
brane minus the mass of the corresponding extremal one; v is the spatial volume of the world
volume;  is related to the ten-dimensional gravitational constant through 22 = 16g10;
n is the number of the coincident d3-branes; and j, , t and s represent the angular
momentum, angular velocity, hawking temperature, and the entropy, respectively. finally,
r+ is the horizon radius of the black three-branes, which is

r2
+ =

1

2 (cid:16)l4 + 8m  l2(cid:17) .

(7)

in [20] we showed that in the grand canonical ensemble the heat capacity becomes negative
when l4/ > 8/3, which indicates there is a critical point at l4/m = 8/3. in the canonical

3

ensemble there is also a similar critical point. therefore the black three-brane is unstable
when the angular momentum is beyond a certain critical value. according to the malda-
cenas conjecture, this also implies that there is a phase transition in the n = 4 large n
super yang-mills theory in four dimensions at nite temperature [19,20]. in the microcanon-
ical ensemble, where the energy e and the angular momentum j are xed, however, similar
to the case for the small mass schwarzschild-ads black hole, the above instability is absent.
instead a localization instability mentioned above will appear. that is, at lower energies
and large angular momentums, the system enters into another entropically favored state,
which, according to the no-hair theorem of black holes, should be described by a kerr black
hole. in addition, the d3-branes distributed on a planar disc [22] might be an appropriate
source for the kerr solution.

a d-dimensional (d  4) kerr black hole solution with an angular momentum parameter

was given in [25]. in boyer-lindquist coordinates, its metric is

ds2 =  dt2 + sin2 (r2 + a2)d2 + (dt + a sin2 d2)2

+ dr2 + 2d2 + r2 cos2 dd4,

(10)

here d2 = 2(d1)/2/[(d  1)/2] is the area of a unit (d  2)-sphere. the horizon of
the kerr black hole is determined by the equation grr = 0, that is,

and the entropy of the solution is one quarter horizon area,

(11)

(12)

here it seems worth pointing out that for higher dimensional (d > 5) kerr black holes there
is no any restriction on the angular momentum for having the black hole horizon.

now let us compare the entropies of the rotating black three brane (6) and a ten-
dimensional kerr black hole (12). for small mass and large angular momentum (e/j << 1),
we nd

(13)

from which we can clearly see that the kerr black hole has larger entropy when e = mk
and j = jk. thus we conclude that at low energies and beyond a certain critical angular
momentum, a typical state is a ten-dimensional kerr black hole. the critical curve of the
localization transition is given by

211/43/2n 1/2m1/2r+v = 22(r2

k + a2)r6

k8,

(14)

with e = mk and j = jk, where r+ and rk are given by (7) and (11), respectively.

now we discuss the rotating m5-branes in the eleven-dimensional supergravity. similar to
the case of the rotating d3-brane, we also consider the case in which an angular momentum
parameter does not vanish only. the rotating m5-brane solution has been given in [26,27].
the metric can be written down as

performing a double dimensional reduction along one of brane directions, one can obtain a
rotating black d4-brane solution in the type iia supergravity. in this reduction, thermody-
namics is kept unchanged. near the extremal limit, some thermodynamic quantities of the
black m5-branes are [20]

e = 253122mv,
j = 27/3317/65/3n 1/2m1/2lv,
 = 22/35/61/3n 1/2m1/2lr+,

where  is related to the eleven-dimensional gravitational constant through 22 = 16g11
and v is the spatial volume of the world volume. under the large angular momentum
approximation, the entropy (21) of the rotating m5-branes behaves as

while a eleven-dimensional, large angular momentum kerr black hole has entropy behavior:

s  m3/2l2  e5/2j 2,

(22)

sk  7/6a1/3  m 3/2

k j 1/3

k

.

(23)

when e = mk and j = jk, obviously, we have sk > s. therefore, beyond a critical angular
momentum, the system enters into a phase described by a kerr black hole. the localization
instability happens at s = sk, that is,

210/33113/65/3n 1/2m1/2r+v = 22(r2

k + a2)r7

k9,

(24)

with e = mk and j = jk, where r+ and rk are given by (16) and (11), respectively. here
we should point out that if one considers the rotating d4-brane version, he can still easily
nd from (13) that the entropy of a ten-dimensional kerr black hole is larger than that of
the rotating d4-brane. that is, at low energies, beyond a critical angular momentum, the
kerr black hole is the entropically favored phase.

we now turn to the rotating black m2-branes. the rotating black m2-brane metric with

a non-vanishing angular momentum is [26]

(26)

performing a double dimensional reduction along with x1 or x2, the rotating black m2-brane
solution (25) will be reduced to a rotating black fundamental string solution in the type iia

6

supergravity. near the extremal limit, we have the following thermodynamic quantities of
the rotating black m2-brane [20]:

e = 31742mv,
j = 22/3317/34/3n 1/2m1/2lv,
 = 22/35/32/3n 1/2m1/2lr4

(29)

(30)

(31)

as the previous cases, here v is the spatial volume of the world volume and 22 is the
eleven-dimensional gravitational constant. under the low energy and large large angular
momentum approximation, from (31) we have

s  m3/4l1/2  ej 1/2.

(32)

comparing with the entropy (23) of the eleven-dimensional kerr black hole, unfortunately,
in this case, we are unable to obtain a denite conclusion of which entropy is larger. indeed,
the rotating black m2-brane is peculiar. in [20] we have already noticed that for the rotating
m2-branes, there is a critical point as the cases for the rotating d3-brane and m5-brane in
the grand canonical ensemble; unlike the d3-brane and m5-brane, however, there is no
critical point in the canonical ensemble. here in the microcanonical ensemble, the dierent
behavior also appears in the rotating m2-brane. to verify whether the localization instability
occurs or not, one has to make a careful comparison of entropy between the large angular
momentum rotating m2-brane and the kerr black hole. anyway, if the localization transition
takes place, it must be at

25/33110/34/3n 1/2m1/2r+v = 22(r2

k + a2)r7

k9,

(33)

with e = mk and j = jk, where r+ and rk are given by (26) and (11), respectively.

in summary, we have discussed the microcanonical phases on the rotating d3-brane, m5-
brane (d4-brane) and m2-brane, paying attention to the so-called localization instability. at
low energies, beyond a certain critical angular momentum, we have argued that the system
enters into another entropically favored phase: the phase is described by a high dimensional
kerr black hole. that is, there is a localization phase transition from some rotating black
branes to corresponding kerr black holes when the angular momentum reaches its critical
value, at least for the d3 and m5 (d4) branes as shown in this paper. here we should mention
that for the rotating d1-d5-branes, martinec and sahakian [12] have already argued the
existence of such kind of localization phase transition from ads3  s3 to a six-dimensional
kerr black hole. note that the localization transition does not occur for the static d-branes
and m-branes. therefore, this is completely the eect of angular momentum. of course,
there exist other phases in the microcanonical ensemble of strings on the rotating d-branes.
for instance, as shown in [14], we expect that when the horizon size of the kerr black hole
falls into the regime of the string scale, the system goes into a hagedorn, or long string
phase, where the fundamental string dominates the entropy, this is associated with the
correspondence principle of horowitz and polchinski [28]. at the lower energies and angular
momentums, another new phase may occur, where a gas of supergravitons propagating in a

7

rotating ads space dominate the entropy. it would be interesting to make a detailed analysis
of the microcanonical phases of string theory on the d-branes. in addition, in this paper we
have analyzed only the rotating d-branes with a single angular momentum parameter. we
expect that similar localization instability exists in some rotating d-branes with multiple
angular momentum parameters.

finally, we mention that more recently two papers [29] and [30] have appeared, which
relate the rotating branes to the charged ads black holes in gauged supergravity theories
and discuss many properties of the charged ads black holes.
