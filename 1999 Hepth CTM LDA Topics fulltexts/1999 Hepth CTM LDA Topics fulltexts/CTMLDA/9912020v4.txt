abstract

we consider the question of gauge invariance of the wilson loop
in the light of a new treatment of axial gauge propagator proposed
recently based on a nite eld-dependent brs (ffbrs) transforma-
tion. we remark that as under the ffbrs transformation the vacuum
expectation value of a gauge invariant observable remains unchanged,
our prescription automatically satises the wilson loop criterion. fur-
ther, we give an argument for direct verication of the invariance of
wilson loop to o(g4) using the earlier work by cheng and tsai. we
also note that our prescription preserves the thermal wilson loop to
o(g2).

the axial-type gauges have found favor in many standard model calcu-
lations on account of their formal ghost-free nature. associated, however,
with the axial gauges, are the problems posed by the spurious 1/(  q)p-type

singularities. much literature has been devoted to the question of how these
these singularities can be interpreted [1]. there are a number of prescrip-
tions for these singularities, some of which are the principle-value prescription
(pvp) [2], leibbrandt-mandelstam (lm)[3], the -prescription [4], the van
niewenhuizen-landsho prescription [5] (for a subset of axial gauges), etc.
pvp and lm are associated with extensive literature and some of their lim-
itations have been established [6]. many of the prescriptions have been of
an ad-hoc nature and as a result require validation in the form of various
checks such as validity of wt identities [1], preservation of wilson loop [7]
and the thermal wilson loop [8], etc. it has, for example, been shown that
the pvp does not preserve the wilson loop to o(g4)[9]. the same holds for
the thermal wilson loop and the -prescription [10].

recently, we have proposed [11, 12], a direct way to handle the 1/(  q)p-

type singularities based on a nite eld-dependent brs (ffbrs) transformation[13,
14]. this method is based directly on correlating the generating functionals
themselves [15] in the two set of gauges via ffbrs transformation. such a
set of transformations automatically preserves the vacuum expectation value
of gauge-invariant observables to all orders. to be concrete, consider the
eective actions (in obvious notations)

e[a, c, c, ] = s0[a]  z d4x(cid:18) 1
sl
 sl
e + o1[a, c, c],

2

(  a)2 + cm c + i[

1
2

(a)2  cc](cid:19)
(1)

where the -terms in se have been put in accordance with the replacement
q2  q2 + i for all poles in the lorentz-type gauges [16]. as implied in
[12, 15], the correct treatment of axial-type gauges is obtained via an eective
action (in obvious notations)

ef f [a, c, c, ] = s0[a]  z d4x(cid:18) 1
sa

1[a, c, c]
(2)
where the o() terms in sa
e are obtained by performing a eld transformation
[a, c, c]  [a, c, c] which is an ffbrs transformation [12, 13] such that it
preserves the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude:

(  a)2 + c m c(cid:19) + o

2

z dadcdceisl

e [a,c,c] = z dadcdceisa

e [a,c,c].

(3)

2

such eld transformations were constructed in a general context in [13]. as
remarked in [11, 15], these transformations also preserve the vacuum expec-
tation values of gauges-invariant observables:

z dadcdcogi[a]eisl

e [a,c,c] = z dadcdcogi[a]eisa

e [a,c,c].

(4)

such a procedure was indeed adopted for the purpose of interpretation of
(q)p -type singularities in axial-type gauges [11, 12].

1

in view of the fact that the wilson loop

w [l] = htrp t eigh adxui

(5)

is a gauge-invariant observable, it follows from (4) that our treatment is such
that by its very construction, the wilson loop w [l] has the same value in
the lorentz and axial-type gauges to all orders.

while (4) provides a formal proof of the equivalence of w [l] for the
two sets of gauges, we shall also provided a reasonably brief proof of this
statement to o(g4). we utilize the work of cheng and tsai [7] in order to
shorten the argument.

we note that our propagator of [11, 12] is in fact of the general form used

by cheng and tsai [7]:

d =

i

k2 + i (g  ak  bk),

(6)

where a(k) = b(k) by bose symmetry. cheng and tsai [7] prove the
equivalence of wilson loops in two gauges by introducing an eective ghost-
ghost-gluon vertex:

g(k) = i

[(a  k)  1]k  k2a(k)]

k2 + i

(7)

(which includes propagator of outgoing ghost). as such the entire proof of
equivalence of the wilson loops in the lorentz and axial-type gauges would
go through, were it not for the fact that in our treatment the ghost as well as
gluon propagator arise rather out of the eective action sa
e[a, c, c]. con-
sequently, the results of [7] would imply the equivalence of wilson loop in
the two sets of gauges (axial and lorentz) to o(g4) veried there if we could

3

show that the two treatments of ghosts do not make any dierence to this
order.

for the sake of brevity, we refer the reader to the diagrams (fig. 1) in
[7]. we shall prove the desired result simply by showing that the (only) one
diagram required to be considered in this calculation in fact vanishes for all
loops for 2 < 0 and in fact vanishes for a large class of loops for 2 > 0.

the only diagram to o(g4) that is relevant is the diagram 1(b) of [7]
which is a diagram with two ends of a gluon propagator with a ghost-loop
self-energy insertion. the entire propagator diagram (with the two gluon
propagators) has the structure:

g(p, ) = app + bp + cp + d

(8)

where a, b, c and d are functions of p2,   p (and also depend on 2). the
whole contribution of this diagram to the wilson loop is then of the form:

w [1]  z d4pi dx i dyeip(xy)g(p, ).

(9)

we shall now give a simple argument that for all loops the rst three terms
in (8) do not contribute to (9). we note that the contribution of the rst
two terms to (9) is of the form

w [1] = z d4pi dx i dyeip(xy)p a(p2,   p)

which could be re-expressed as:

w [1] = z d4p a(p2,   p)i dyeipy i dxpeipx
= z d4p a(p2,   p)i dyeipy i dx(i)eipx.

now, for a xed p and y, we can evaluate

i dx(eipx)

(10)

(11)

(12)

from y to y along the loop and nd that it vanishes. a similar argument

applies to the third term: here we evaluate h dypeipy rst.

we now consider the contribution of the last term. it reads

w [1,4]  z d4pil

dxeipx il

dyeipyd(p2,   p, 2).

(13)

4

the wilson loop is a gauge-invariant quantity. we expect that w [l] is
independent of the orientation of . this is because an innitesimal change
in  obtained through a lorentz transformation, is in fact an innitesimal
change in the gauge xing term (and the associated change in the ghost term).
under such a change, the use of brs wt identities will imply invariance of
w [l], the expectation vale of a gauge invariant operator[17]. therefore, in
evaluating w [l], we can choose to perform a suitable lorentz transformation,
    = 

  on . then (13) becomes:

w [1,4] = z d4pil

dx 

eipx il

dy 

eipyd(p2,    p, 2).

(14)

  such
now, (14) would vanish for a planar loop if we could choose   = 
that it is perpendicular to the loop l ( dx = 0). we now investigate when
this is possible for a planar loop l. the plane of the loop is described (not
necessarily uniquely) by the intersection of

ax = a and bx = b.

(15)

(i) let 2 < 0. we note that at least one of a, b and c  (a  a0
b0 b)
(with b0 6= 0) is necessarily spacelike. we pick a space-like vector of these
three and call it n. then for 2 < 0, we can always choose   parallel to n.
evidently, since d(n  x) = 0, we have  dx = 0 on l and (14) vanishes.

(ii) let 2 > 0. suppose it is possible to construct a time-like vector
out of linear combinations of a and b. then, we call this n and orient  
parallel to n. the argument proceeds as above. evidently, the argument in
this case, does not hold for those planar loops for which time-like normal
does not exist.

(iii) let 2 = 0. if (a  b)2 > a2b2, a real  exists such that a + b is
light-like. in such case, we choose n = a + b and the argument proceeds as
before.

the above argument in fact applies to loops more general than a planar
loop. for example, for 2 < 0, the argument applies to any loop conned to
a 3-dimensional subspace normal to some space-like vector.

the argument easily extends itself to any arbitrary loop for 2 < 0 and
to a subclass of arbitrary loops for 2  0. we close the loop by a surface
s which we cover by a patchwork of n planar loops (we might require the

5

limit n   for a given loop). we can then write

w [l] = htrt p exp(cid:18)il

adx(cid:19)i = htrt p exp(cid:18)

n

xi=1

ici

adx(cid:19)i.

(16)

the relevant o(g4) contribution to w [l] from ghost diagrams comes from
the quadratic terms in the expansion of the exponent, for which the path
ordering is immaterial since tr(t at b) = tr(t bta). such a typical term (apart
from an overall coecient) reads

ici

dx icj

dyg(x, y).

(17)

we can now apply the arguments following equation (8) to the above typical
term. while doing so, we shall come across contribution analogous to (14).
in such a term, we need to choose   perpendicular to one of the two loops
ci and cj. then the entire argument goes through for each such term (i, j)
separately, provided   can always be chosen normal to one of the loops1. as
shown earlier, this is always possible for 2 < 0. for 2  0, this will hold
only for a subclass of loops.

we also note that the o(g2) thermal wilson loop considered in [8] is given

by:

wr = 1 +

(n 2

c  1)g2
2nct

z

d3k
(2)3 [1  cos(~k  ~r)]d00(k0 = 0, ~k)

(18)

and thus depends only on d00(k0 = 0, ~k). we nd that for the propagator
k2+i which is the same as d00(k0 = 0, ~k) for
in [11, 12], d00(k0 = 0, ~k) = g00
lorentz gauges and as such wr has the same value as in lorentz-type gauges.
to summarize, we have emphasized that the treatment we have given for
axial gauge poles [11, 12] is by its very construction, compatible with the
preservation of the wilson loop to all orders. we have further given the

1the above argument in fact assumes that our argument applies separately to each
such term (i, j). this can be seen as follows: let an arbitrary closed loop l be broken
up as a sum of two arbitrary closed loops l1 and l2. then w [l] can be broken up as
w [l] = w [l1] + w [l2] + w [l1, l2]. here, w [l1, l2] depends on both the loops. now
the entire argument of cheng and tsai and the argument we gave for the independence of
direction of  applies to each of w [l], w [l1] and w [l2] and therefore to w [l1, l2]. this
argument can easily be extended to the case when l is broken up in to n loops. hence
etc.

proof of this statement to o(g4) using the earlier work by cheng and tsai.
our proof holds for any arbitrary loop for 2 < 0 and for a subclass of loops
for 2  0. we have also noted the preservation of the thermal wilson loop
to o(g2) for our treatment.
