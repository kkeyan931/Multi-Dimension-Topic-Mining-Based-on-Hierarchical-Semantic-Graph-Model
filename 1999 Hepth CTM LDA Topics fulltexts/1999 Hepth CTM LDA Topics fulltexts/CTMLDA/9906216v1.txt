abstract

we discuss the non-constant dilaton deformed ads5  s5 solutions of iib
supergravity where ads sector is described by black hole. the investiga-
tion of running gauge coupling (exponent of dilaton) of non-susy gauge
theory at nite temperature is presented for dierent regimes (high or low
t , large radius expansion). running gauge coupling shows power-like be-
haviour on temperature with stable xed point. the quark-antiquark po-
tential at nite t is found and possibility of connement is established. it
is shown that non-constant dilaton aects the potential, sometimes revers-
ing its behaviour if compare with the constant dilaton case (n = 4 su-
per yang-mills theory). thermodynamics of obtained backgrounds is stud-
ied.
in particular, next-to-leading term to free energy f is evaluated as

1 introduction.

one of the unsolved problems in ads/cft correspondence [1] (for an excel-
lent review, see [2]) is how to obtain non-susy gauge theory with typical
running coupling as the boundary side. the related question is about con-
nement in such theory. it is desireable to answer these questions from sg
side as it gives strong coupling regime of boundary qft.

there are dierent proposals to get running gauge coupling in non-susy
theory: using type 0 string theory approach [3], deforming n = 4 theory [15]
(also via ads orbifolding [16]) or making non-constant dilaton deformations
of ads5  s5 vacuum in iib sg [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 17]. in the last case non-
constant dilaton breaks conformal invariance and (part of) supersymmetry of
the boundary n = 4 super ym theory. (in the presence of axion (rr-scalar)
part of supersymmetry may be unbroken but dilaton is still non-trivial [14]).
then, exponent of dilaton actually describes the running gauge coupling with
a power-law behaviour and uv-stable xed point. within such picture the
indication to the possibility of connement is also found. the features of
running and connement depend on the axion [8], vectors [9], worldvolume
scalar [10] or curvature of four-dimensional space [17].

from another side, it is also realized that planar ads5 bh is dual to a
thermal state of n = 4 super ym theory. the corresponding coupling con-
stant dependence has been studied in ref.[18, 24] based on earlier study of sg
side free energy in ref.[19]. spherical ads bh shows the nite temperature
phase transition [20] what maybe used to realize the connement in large n
theory at low temperatures [21].

in this paper we attempt to combine these two approaches, i.e. to nd the
deformation of iib sg ads5  s5 background with non-trivial dilaton where
ads sector is described by bh (hence, temperature appears). then, running
gauge coupling of gauge theory at non-zero temperature is given by exponent
of dilaton. we present the class of approximate solutions of iib sg3 with
such properties where running coupling shows power-like behaviour in the
temperature (in the expansion on radius). the quark-antiquark potential for
these solutions is also found and possibility of connement at non-zero tem-
perature is established. corrections to pozition of horizon (in near horizon

descends from n = 4 super ym after breaking of susy and conformal invariance.

regime) and to the temperature are calculated. thermodynamics of obtained
solutions is also investigated.

the paper is organised as follows. in the next section we present the ap-
proximate solution of iib supergravity. it represents dilatonic perturbation
of zero mass hyperbolic ads bh. the temperature dependence of running
gauge coupling (exponent of dilaton) and of corresponding beta-function is
derived in dierent regimes. quark-antiquark potential which is repulsive
unlike to constant dilaton case is analyzed. section 3 is devoted to the study
of the same questions for background representing dilatonic deformation of
(non)planar non-zero mass ads bh. the temperature dependence of running
gauge coupling is dierent from the situation in previous section. conne-
ment is possible as it follows from the study of quark-antiquark potential. in
section 4 we investigate thermodynamic properties of our ads backgrounds.
free energy, mass and entropy are found with account of non-trivial tempera-
ture corrections due to dilaton. this is compared with the leading behaviour
of free energy in n = 4 super yang-mills theory. some outlook is given in
the last section.

2 perturbative solutions of iib supergravity,
running gauge coupling and potential: zero
mass bh case

we start from the action of dilatonic gravity in d + 1 dimensions:

s = 

1

16g z dd+1xg (r    g) .

(1)

in the following, we assume 2   and  to be positive. the action
(1) contains the eective action of type iib string theory. in the type iib
supergravity, which is the low energy eective action of the type iib string
theory, we can consider bosonic background where anti-self-dual ve-form is
given by the freund-rubin-type ansatz and the topology is m5  s5 with
the manifold m5 which is asymptotically ads5. if dilaton only depends on
the coordinates in m5, by integrating ve coordinates on s5, we obtain the
eective ve dimensional theory, which corresponds to d = 4 and  = 1
2 case
in (1). this will be the case under consideration in this work.

obtain4

and from that of dilaton

we now assume the (d + 1)-dimensional metric is given by

here gij does not depend on r and it is the metric in the einstein manifold,
which is deined by

(5)
here rij is ricci tensor dened by gij and k is a constant, especially k > 0
for sphere , k = 0 for minkowski space and k < 0 for hyperboloid. we also
assume ,  and  only depend on r. then the equations (2) when  =  = t,
 =  = r and  = i and  = j give , respectively,

when  = 0, the solution is isomorphic to ads. if we choose k < 0, the

metric has the following form:

(21)

the obtained ads metric has a horizon at r = r0. when r  r0, the metric
behaves as

ds2  

2r0(r  r0)

l2

dt2 +

l2

2r0(r  r0)

dr2 +    .

then if we dene a new coordinate  by

the metric has the following form:

(25)

we now consider the perturbation with respect to c. we will concentrate
on the case of type iib sg in d = 4, by putting  = 1
2. note that in this
approximation the radius is away from horizon. near-horizon regime will be
discussed independently.

for  = 0 and k < 0 case, the leading term for the dilaton  is given by

substituting v0 in (18) into (16)

which gives the temperature dependent running dilaton. we should note that
there is a singularity in the dilaton eld at the horizon r = r0 = 2l2t . the
fact that dilaton may become singular at ir has been mentioned already
in two-boundaries ads solution of iib sg in ref.[4].
it is also interesting
that when r is formally less than r0 than dilaton (and also running coupling)
becomes imaginary.

since the string coupling is given by

g = gse

(gs : constant) ,

we nd the behaviour when r is large and c is small as

g  gs(1 + cl2 

1
2r4 

(2l2t )2

3r6 + o(cid:16)r8(cid:17)! + o(c2)) .

(27)

(28)

here 0 has been absorbed into the redenition of gs. since r is the length
scale corresponding to the radius of the boundary manifold, r can be regarded
as the energy scale of the eld theory on the boundary [11]. therefore the
beta-function is given by

(g) = r

(29)

the rst term is usual and universal [5, 8]. the second term denes the
temperature dependence.

let us comment on the case of high t . as we consider the behaviour near
the boundary, rst we take r to be large. after that we consider the case of
high t . in this case r  t l2 and we can consider the large t case in the
expression (29). the problem might happen when r  t l2. in this case, we
need to solve eq.(26) with respect to r as a function of t and  or coupling:
r = r(g, t ). then from (26) and (27), we nd the following expression of the
beta-function:

(g)  r

=

dg

dr(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)r=r(g,t )

gscl2

r(g, t )4(cid:16)1  l4(2t )2
r(g,t )2 (cid:17)

.

(30)

in case r is large, the above equation reproduces (29). we can also consider
the case that the last term in (26) is larger than the second term which
contains ln(  ). in this case, the coupling is given by
2l2 (2t )2 r2   ! ,

g  gs 1 +

(31)

c

which changes the leading behavior of the beta-function:

(g)  2 (g  gs) +    .

(32)

this beta-function presumbly denes strong coupling regime of non-susy
gauge theory at high temperature. it is interesting to note that in pertur-
bative gauge theory at non-zero temperature the running gauge coupling
contains not only standard logarithms of t but also terms linear on t (see
ref.[22] and references therein). of course, in our case we have not af theory
but the one with stable xed point.

now we consider the correction for v and u , writing them in the following

form:

v = v0 + c2v , u = 1 + c2u .

(33)

substituting (33) and neglecting the higher orders in c2, we obtain

and c1 and c2 are constants of the integration, which should vanish if we
require u, v  0 when r  .
from (35) and (36), we nd that u and v or e2 and e2 have the sin-
gularity at the unperturbative horizon corresponding to s = 1. eq.(26) tells
also that the dilaton eld is also singular there. in other words, the expan-
sion with respect to c2 breaks down when s  0. therefore the singularity
in u, v would not be real one.

that the radius of the horizon is large and use 1

that

let us turn now to the analysis of the potential between quark and anti-

quark[6]. we evaluate the following nambu-goto action

s =

2 z d drdet (cid:16)gs

xx(cid:17) .

(43)

with the string metric gs
, which could be given by multiplying a dilaton
function e to the metric tensor in (4). we consider the static conguration
x0 =  , x1  x = , x2 = x3 =    = xd1 = 0 and r = r(x). choose the
coordinates on the boundary manifold so that the line given by x0 =constant,
x1  x and x2 = x3 =    = xd1 = 0 is geodesic and g11 = 1 on the line.
substituting the conguration into (43), we nd

s = t

v (r)

(44)

here t is the length of the region of the denition of  . the orbit of r can be
obtained by minimizing the action s or solving the euler-lagrange equation

e0 = e(r)vuut

is a constant. if we assume r has a nite minimum rmin, where xr|r=rmin = 0,
e0 is given by

introducing a parameter t, we parametrize r by

e0 = e(rmin)qu(rmin)v (rmin) .

here e(l) expresses the total energy of the quark-anti-quark system.
the energy e(l) in (51), however, contains the divergence due to the self
energies of the innitely heavy quark and anti-quark. the sum of their
self energies can be estimated by considering the conguration x0 =  , x1 =
x2 = x3 =    = xd1 = 0 and r = r() (note that x1 vanishes here) and

the minimum of r is rmin. using the parametrization of (47), we nd the

we should note that next-to-leading term is linear in l. since bc
a =
0.503697... > 0 and k < 0, the potential is repulsive. the above result has
qualitatively dierent structure in the next-to-leading term due to the curva-
ture parameter k from that in [23], where the potential at nite temperature
has been evaluated. the expression (53) is correct even at high temperature
if l is small or rmin is large. if rmin is small and the orbit of string approaches
to the horizon and/or enters inside the horizon, the expression would not be
valid. since the horizon is given by (21), the expression (53) would be valid
if

rmin  r0 = ls

or using (25) and (50),

l  as

12

we can also evaluate the potential between monopole and anti-monopole

using the nambu-goto action for d-string instead of (43) (cf.ref.[13]):

s =

1

2 z d de2rdet (cid:16)gs

xx(cid:17) .

(56)

for the static conguration x0 =  , x1  x = , x2 = x3 =    = xd1 = 0
and y = y(x), we nd, instead of (44)

s = t

2 z dxe(r)vuutu(r)v (r) u(r)

v (r)

(xr)2 + 1! .

(57)

since  is proportional to c and v and u contain c in the form of its square c2,
the potential between monopole and anti-monopole is given by changing c by
c in the potential between quark and anti-quark. since the expression (53)
does not contain c in the given order, the potential em m(l) for monopole and
anti-monopole is identical with that of quark and anti-quark in this order:

em m(l) = eq q(l) .

(58)

hence, we showed that non-constant dilaton deformation of iib sg vacuum
changes the structure of potential and connement is becoming non-realistic.

3 running coupling and quark-antiquark po-
non-zero

tential at nite temperature:
mass bh case

in this section we consider another interesting case that k = 0 and  6= 0,
which corresponds to the throat limit of d3-brane [18, 19]5 and v0 has the
following form:

v0 =

r4
l2   .

(59)

5 in ref.[18] -corrections to leading term (t 4) of free energy for above ads bh have
been derived. the temperature was actually xed. in the case under discussion we consider
dilatonic deformation of such ads bh using tree level bosonic sector of iib sg. thus, we
dene the corrections (next-to-the leading term on the temperature) to solution (and free
energy).

the behaviour of the potential is qualitatively identical with that in [23]

therefore the l3 potential becomes attractive if l6 (t )4 > c and repulsive
if l6 (t )4 < c. in other words, the behaviour of monopole-antimonopole
potential is reversed.

(88)

note that the second term vanishes when k = 0, which is the reason why the
behaviour of the next-to-leading term in k = 0 is dierent from that in k 6= 0.
eq.(85) gives the temperature dependence in the coupling (87) and the beta-
function (88). the next-to-leading term shows again power-like behaviour
on g as it happened already in iib sg solutions of refs.[4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 17]
(no temperature) and in guts with large internal dimensions [12]. note
that two of the parameters k,  and t are independent. if we consider the
high temperature regime by xing k,  becomes large and the behaviour
approaches to k = 0 case in (70). on the other hand, if we consider the
high temperature regime by xing , k is positive and becomes large and the
behaviour approaches to k < 0 and  = 0 case in (30). one can also nd
quark-antiquark potential which looks very complicated so we do not write
it explicitly.

the expression of s contains the divergence coming from large r. in order to
subtract the divergence, we regularize s in (94) by cutting o the integral
at a large radius rmax. after that we subtract the divergent part. in case of

the leading behaviours of f and s are consistent with [18]. as we used
1
r expansion, the second terms in (106) become dominant when the radius
of horizon rh is large and the parameter c specifying non-trivial dilaton is
not very small. notice that in other temperature regimes (or using another
schemes for approximated solutions of gravitational equations) one can get
also qualitatively dierent thermodynamical next-to-leading terms (on tem-
perature). one has to remark that leading term in above free energy describes
the strong coupling regime free energy for n = 4 super ym theory with the
usual mismatch factor 3/4 if compare with perturbative free energy (for a
detailed discussion of this case, see[18]).

5 discussion

we studied the approximate (dilaton perturbed) solutions of iib sg near bh-
like ads5s5 background. thanks to presence of dilaton, the running gauge
coupling of non-susy gauge theory at nite temperature may be extracted
from these solutions.
it is interesting that corresponding strong coupling
regime beta-function may depend on the temperature in the complicated
way (mainly, power-like behaviour). we also estimated quark-antiquark (and
monopole-antimonopole) potential at nite temperature from sg side. its
comparison with the potential of n = 4 super ym theory at nite temper-
ature is also done. it is remarkable that connement depending on features
of geometry and dilaton may occur.

as our iib sg solutions are approximate (actually large radius expan-
sion) it is clear that one is able to develop other schemes to search for similar

23

solutions. unfortunately, it is not yet clear how to identify explicitly bound-
ary non-susy thermal gauge theory corresponding to these solutions. one
possibility is to calculate free energy from sg side (with non-trivial dilaton)
and compare it with free energy of perturbative thermal gauge theories with
running gauge coupling. the last quantity is available in qft.

note also that one can generalize our solutions via adding rr-
scalar(axion) to bosonic sector of iib sg as it was discussed in refs.[14].
as it follows from results of refs.[8, 17] the structure of running gauge cou-
pling changes drastically in this case. in particular, part of supersymmetries
may be unbroken [14] but asymptotic freedom may be realized in strong cou-
pling phase [8, 17]. we expect that at nite temperature this property may
survive.

acknoweledgements we thank j. ambjrn for the interest to this work.
