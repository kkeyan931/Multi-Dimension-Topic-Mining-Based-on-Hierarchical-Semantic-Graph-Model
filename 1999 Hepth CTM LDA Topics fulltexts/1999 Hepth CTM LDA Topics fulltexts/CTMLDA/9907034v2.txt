abstract

this is a slightly extended version of a seminar given the 8th of
june at the tasi 99 at colorado university in boulder. the moti-
vations behind two time theory are explained and the theory is intro-
duced via one of the theorys easier gauges of a particle on a black
hole background. important results that should be interesting as well
in the light of the recent ads mania will be summarized.

1 motivations for two times

1.1 i have two times

here is one common misconception about two time theory: they saw many
spatial dimensions being used so they tried many time dimensions. after
realizing there would be new negative norm states (ghosts) they looked des-
perately for a gauge freedom to x it.

seen this way, the theory seems articial, contrived and just not asked

for.

this is not the way two time theory has been found. i personally like
to introduce it in the following way (not quite historically stringent either) -
stressing that nature actually tells us that two times are needed:

1

the huge success of todays fundamental theories like the standard model
and general relativity is due to localization of global gauge freedoms. say
you start out discovering that the world shows poincare symmetry. lifting
this symmetry to a local one (motto: why should a region here be too rigidly
related to a region over there) gives back general relativity. once we recognize
that a global symmetry becomes much more fundamental when localized,
nature tells us in this way that it has gravity, photons, and so on. there is
one global symmetry that has never been localized. it is the sp(2) symmetry
in phase space. the symmetry acts on the doublet

2 ! =   x
  1
p !

which lets us rewrite the quantization [x, p ] = ih as

igijj = ih

(1)

(2)

where (gij) =   0 1

0 !. just like nature tells us i have gravity when

1

localizing the poincare symmetry, it says i have two times when localizing
this symmetry. let us see how so. write down the easiest lagrangian that
would give us an energy x  p back:

 =

, g =

i, gijj

(3)

where (gij) =   0 1
group metric (gij) = 


p !, or for example use the osp(1/2)
0 !if  =   x

if  = 



i 0
0
0 0 1

0 1

, that is, if we want to




include spin degrees of freedom, or use sp(2n) for n particles and so on.
the localization is a standard method. we introduce the covariant derivative
; = (, ga) and get


x
p

 =

the euler lagrange equations give the equations of motion as:

, = ga   = 
ij = 0  x  x = 0 = x  p = 0 = p  p

thus it follows that x and p are two light like vectors that are not parallel.
therefore they have to have two time like dimensions and they must have
d + 2 entries. we write x m where m  {0, 0, 1, ...} and x m is now a
so(d, 2) vector. thus we see via the localization that nature insists on two
times because this is the only way not to get a trivial theory after gauge
xing all three gauge choices that sp(2)  sl(2, r)  so(2, 1) oers. the
three gauge choices (ve for osp(1/2)) x a gauge surface inside the so(d, 2)
symmetric starting space such that we are left with so(d  1, 1). the third
gauge choice xes the parametrization of the world line  (t). note that we
have to have one more time and one more spatial direction - nature is telling
us about two times only, not about many times. we write x m where m 
{0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, ..., d  2} . the accident sp(2)  so(2, 1) means that
we can interpret the above as conformal gravity on the world line. for the
osp(1/2) case it is conformal supergravity on the world line.

1.2 more motivations for two times

looking at m-theory dualities one immediately bumps into two problems:

firstly, in order to put all the dualities into one group, we need a bigger
group than allowed by a (d  1, 1) signature of the space time. looking at
supergravity is enough to understand this. people tried to nd the one group
that could give us sugra, but osp(1/32) is too small and osp(1/64) would
lead to particles with spin higher than 2 if realized in the usual signature.
in order to embed all we know about m-theory and its dualities, we need
osp(1/64) and therefore we need two times if we want to avoid particles
with spin larger than 2 . this means we need 13 dimensions to start with,
i.e. so(11, 2) to be gauged down to a so(10, 1) theory.

secondly, m-theory provides dualities between theories with diering
topologies. this is what two time theory is very strong in. often dier-
ent theories are sp(2) -gauge duals with dierent topologies of the gauge
surfaces. examples are the massless particle having a world line that goes
through the origin of the x 0  x 0 -plane and the simple harmonic oscillator
having a world line that is a circle in this plane.

2 remarks to be noted

many people used spaces with two time like dimensions in one form or an-
other. there is a neat way to get ads spaces from embeddings in two times.
these are geometrical tricks. the two time theory described here is very
dierent in the following ways:

1) it is a dynamical theory. we start out with an lagrangian and can

generalize to the string case which means it is an interacting theory.

2) it gives well known ghostfree physical systems.
3) it is a consistent and unitary quantum theory. the so(d, 2) covari-
(d2  4) =
(d2  4) and the canonical or eld theoretical quantization after gauge

ant quantization gives the casimir c2[so(d,2)] = 4c2[sp(2)] 
0 
xing gives c2 = 

(d2  4) also [5].

4) we easily can include spin [3] and supersymmetry [7].

3 example

it is high time to give an easy example. the example given will be published
shortly in a wider context [1]. it is very easy since after gauge xing we are
left with an only 1 + 1-dimensional system. write

the 1 and the 0 are gauge choices, n is a conformal factor, the rest are
names given. we have to satisfy x  x = 0 = x  p (6 ) and do this with

the metric is given by + = + = 1 and the line element is

(ds)2 = (dx m )(dxm ) = 2n 2dudv

inserting these forms in the original sp(2, r) local and so(2, 2) global invari-
ant lagrangian [5] gives

the metric is recognized in the line element or in the last line g = n 2,
which is obtained by integrating out the momenta.

this form shows that the system has the larger symmetry so(2, 2) whose
generators are the lorentz generators in the 2+2 dimensional space lm n =
x m p n  x n p m . we quantize via [u, pu] = i = [v, pv]. in the present gauge
these take a form that is quantum ordered already:

= upu + vpv, l++ = pv

l+
l+ = pu, l+ = u2pu
l = v2pv, l+ = upu + vpv

4 results

two time theory led to some astonishing results already. often the results are
just a better understanding or interpretation of known methods or facts.
among these results fall the understanding of the origin of the so(d, 2) -
symmetry that occurs in certain spectra as being there from the very start
in the two time description.

there is the more natural interpretation of the standard method [4] in
order to go from global ads to the black hole solution. one has had to
identify and complexify because both are gauges in a space time with two
times [1].

and for example the always mysterious kappa-symmetry has bosonic
partners and becomes understandable [7]. let us devide the main results
into two categories:

4.1 dualities

in the point particle two time theory it was shown that the massless, the
massive, the relativistic, the non-relativistic particle, the simple harmonic
oscillator, the particle in an arbitrary central potential, the particle on an
ads-background, on an ads s-background, on an btz background, on an
robertson-bertotti background and others are all sp(2)-gauge dual theories;
meaning they all derive from the same two time theoretical starting point via
dierent choices of the three gauge parameters. for the generalization to the
string case where only the tensionless and the rigid string have been found
yet [8], this could mean that the tensionless and tensionful and iia and iib
etc. strings can all be gotten in a similar way from one common unifying
theory with two times.

6

4.2 hidden symmetries

the space-time before gauging shows so(d, 2) -symmetry. this symmetry
is still there in the gauged theory but it is hard to see since it is non-linearly
realized. this was known only for the hydrogen atom and the superpar-
ticle [9]. in [7] it was shown how the action of the superparticle that has
hidden superconformal symmetries derives from the two time starting point
where these symmetries are manifest and still linear before projection onto
the gauge surface. two time theory has shown that these hidden symmetries
are inside all of the spectra of all the gauge dual theories. that means that
all the mentioned systems have these hidden symmetries. hidden means
that the symmetries are symmetries of the action and not of the hamilto-
nian. symmetries hidden in the action can be as vital as the lorentz boost
symmetry for a free particle: a lagrangian like  = mq1
r2 (or better
the hamiltonian h = p2 + m2) does not reveal it but surely one would
question someones understanding of the system at hand if that somebody
were not to realize that this expression describes a relativistic particle.

.

in the gauged sugra adsn sm the bosonic subgroup is so(n 1, 2)
so(m + 1) which is smaller than the full so(n + m, 2). as observed in [6]
already: the ads  s discussion may benet from this.

5 outlook

there are very many things that one might try to put into a two time de-
scription. a few that have not been attempted yet are:

- the tensionless string gauge being found there should be a string with
tension. this is similar to the massless point particle gauge that was a
precursor for the massive one. then of course it needs a generalization to
p-branes.

- the introduction of background elds is expected to lead to an elec-
tromagnetic theory that is manifestly dual between electrical and magnetic
phenomena and still so(d, 2) covariant of course as well.

- only two time theory can give a large enough supergroup to give m-
theory, thus two time theory should lead to m-theory but there is only a
toy-model [10] yet.

5.1 how to get further into the subject

this subject has been developed over the past few years and all the recent
papers by the pioneer of two time physics itzhak bars are recommendet.
as a further introduction all those papers can be a little too much though,
therefore there will be a dierent and self contained approach from rst
principles given in [1] .
