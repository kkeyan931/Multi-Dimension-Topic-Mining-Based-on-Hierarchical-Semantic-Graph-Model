radiative corrections arising from the axial coupling of charged fermions to a constant vector
 can induce a lorentz- and cpt-violating chern-simons term in the qed action. we calculate
b
the exact one-loop correction to this term keeping the full b
 dependence, and show that in the
physically interesting cases it coincides with the lowest-order result. the eect of regularization and
renormalization and the implications of the result are briey discussed.

11.30.cp, 11.30.er, 11.30.qc

the possible breaking of cpt and lorentz invariance due to non-conventional physics has been recently addressed
by constructing extensions of the standard model that include tiny non-invariant renormalizable terms (see ref. [15]
and references therein; the possibility of dynamical lorentz symmetry breaking has been considered in ref. [6]). in
particular, it is interesting to consider the qed sector of such extensions. we shall only be concerned here with the
lorentz-violating cpt-odd terms, which for a single charged (dirac) fermion read

s cpt =z d4x(cid:20)a   b 5 +

stringent experimental bounds can be put on the pure-photon cpt-violating term [7], which is of the chern-simons
form [8] (a disputed claim exists, however, for a nonzero ~k [9,10]). moreover, this term introduces tachyonic modes in
the photon spectrum and, for a timelike k, a vacuum instability [7,11]. hence, both experiment and theory suggest
that k should vanish (at least in the timelike case). a natural question is then whether a non-zero k can be induced
by radiative corrections involving lorentz and cpt-violating couplings in other sectors of the total low-energy theory.
in that case, the tight bounds on k would also constrain these sectors. in the qed extension such corrections can
only arise from the axial-vector term, with coupling b.

several authors have tried to answer this question. all calculations have been performed to one loop and at leading
order in b, and have rendered a nite result. however, despite some early claims of denite values for the induced k
[3,12], it seems quite clear now that the result is ambiguous [2,1315], i.e., depends on the details of the high-energy
theory [16]. it is our purpose here to calculate the one-loop corrections to all orders in the coupling b and discuss
the relevant issues in the light of the exact result. after this work had been completed, we learnt that j. m. chung
had carried out the same calculation (for b2 < m2), with the same result [17].

the relevant quantity is the parity-odd part of the vacuum polarization, which must be of the form

where p is the external momentum and the function k is a scalar. the contribution to the induced chern-simons
term in the eective action is given by


odd(p) = bpk(p, b, m),

(2)

and must be a function of b2/m2. to one-loop, the only contributing diagram coincides with the standard one-loop
vacuum-polarization but with the usual fermion propagator replaced by the b-exact propagator

(k) = 

1
2

bk(0, b, m) ,

(3)

sb(k) =

i

6 k  m  6 b5

.

(4)

we use a hermitian 5 with tr{5} = 4i and g = diag(1, 1, 1, 1). in order to keep the full
dependence on b we must rationalize the propagator. we nd

sb(k) = i

(6 k + m  6 b5)(k2  m2  b2 + [6 k, 6 b]5)

(k2  m2  b2)2 + 4(k2b2  (k  b)2)

,

(5)

1

which agrees with the expression given in ref. [1]. as discussed there, this propagator has four poles that occur at
real values of k0 [18]. the one-loop vacuum polarization reads

 (p) =z

d4k
(2)4 tr {sb(k)sb(k  p)} .

(6)

this integral is linearly divergent. eq. 5 allows us to compute the trace in the numerator, which for the odd terms in
b reduces to pf(k, p, b, m), with

f(k, p, b, m) = bf (1)

 (k, p, b, m) + kf (2)

 (k, p, b, m)

=  4i(cid:8)b(cid:2)2m2(k2  m2  b2) + (k2 + m2 + b2)((k  p)2  m2 + b2) + 4k  b(k  p)  b(cid:3)

 2k(cid:2)(k2  m2 + b2)(k  p)  b + ((k  p)2  m2 + b2)k  b(cid:3)(cid:9) .

the linearly divergent term has disappeared, leaving an integral which is just logarithmically divergent by power
counting. since we are only interested in k(p, b, m) for p = 0 and, luckily, no term with bk appears, we can
simplify the calculation by setting p = 0 in f(k, p, b, m) and in the denominator of the integral. we are then left
with two integrals which only depend on b and m. the rst one is already of the form bk1(0, b, m) . the second
integral must also give a result of the form bk2(0, b, m), and k2(0, b, m) can be calculated multiplying the integral
by b and dividing by b2 (as long as b is not lightlike). in this way, we arrive at the following expression:

in order to calculate this integral, we go to euclidean space via a wick rotation of k0 and then perform an analytic
continuation to be = (ib0,~b):

k(0, b, m) = 4iz d4k

here the scalar product is euclidean. one can directly see at this stage that the result must be nite. indeed, for
very large |ke| the leading term in the integrand has the form

which gives a vanishing result if the integral is done symmetrically. the other terms are power-counting nite. this
also shows an ambiguity in the induced term: the integral of the expression (10) is regularization dependent!

this integral is well-behaved for large |ke|. note the appearance of the sign function. for m 6= 0, the nal result is
(going back to the minkowskian b):

(13)

(14)

for any timelike b and for a spacelike b with |b2| < m2, eq. (13) is the relevant one. surprisingly enough, in these
cases our calculation to all orders in b gives the same result as the one obtained in the b-linear approximation of
ref. [15]. obviously, perturbation theory about b = 0 does not detect the dierent behaviour we have found for
b2 > m2. on the other hand, continuity in b2 implies that the lightlike case, b2 = 0, is also given by eq. (13). in
fact, dimensional analysis shows that the b-linear approximation is exact for vanishing b2. note also in passing that
for the ne-tuned value b2 =  16

7 m2, a vanishing (k) is obtained.

if the fermion is massless, m = 0, we nd (k) =  1

162 b for any kind of b. in this simple case, there are at

least three other possible ways of calculating the induced term, which give the same answer:

1. a simpler b-exact propagator can obtained for m = 0:

sb(k) = i

(6 k + 6 b5)(k2 + b2  2k  b5)

(k + b)2(k  b)2

.

(15)

the calculation can then be simplied using feynman parameters and the result (k) =  1
any b.

162 b is found for

2. perturbatively, one can perform just a b-linear calculation, since in the massless case the higher-order terms
vanish for dimensional reasons. from eq. (14) in ref. [15], the same (k) results. the only contribution comes
from the surface term in eq. (10) of jackiw-kosteleckys calculation.

3. a conrmation of the same result, non-perturbative in b and in the ne-structure constant, is provided in
ref. [13] (following a suggestion by d. colladay): an anomalous chiral redenition of the fermion elds allows to
get rid of the coupling to b, so that the contribution (to all orders) to k(0, b, 0) comes from the corresponding
fujikawa jacobian. up to the unavoidable ambiguity (which in this method comes from the denition of the
current operator),  1

162 b is obtained again.

an infrared regularization can spoil this result. for instance, giving the fermion a small mass obviously shifts it
3
162 b in the timelike-b case. at any rate this is just a formal discussion, since there are no massless
back to
electromagnetically-charged fermions in nature.

we have also calculated the integral in eq. 8 directly in minkowski space, using rst the residues method to perform
the integration on k0, and integrating on ~k afterwards. although the result diers by a constant, because k0 and ~k
are not treated symmetrically, the same dependence on b2 and m2 is found.

it is rather striking that the contributions to (k) of diagrams with more than one insertion of 6 b5 vanish.
we have explicitly checked that this is indeed the case at order bb2. at this and higher orders, all integrals are
nite by power-counting, and hence unambigous. s. coleman has observed that the vanishing of these higher order
contributions can be explained by his argument with s.l. glashow in ref. [3], which can be applied to nite diagrams
with insertions of 6 b5 [19]. consider a two-photon amplitude with n > 1 insertions of 6 b5. the idea is to let each of
the two photons carry dierent momenta, p and q (the insertions carry non-zero momentum then). gauge invariance
implies transversality in each of the photons. dierentiating each of the transversality conditions with respect to the
corresponding momentum, one learns that the amplitude is o(pq). it follows that when ones goes to equal momenta,
q = p, the amplitude is o(p2). since the chern-simons term in the eective action is o(p), one concludes that

3

this amplitude does not contribute to (k). in ref. [3], this argument is proved to be valid to any order in the
ne-structure constant. note, however, that it does not apply to diagrams with just one insertion, due to the presence
of triangular anomalies [15].

let us discuss now how regularization and renormalization aect the result. this is an important point because
the complete s qed + s cpt theory is not nite and requires renormalization (and, furthermore, renormalization is also
relevant in a nite theory [20,21]). the exact decomposition sb(k) = s(k)  isb(k)6 b5s(k) performed in ref. [15],
shows that the ambiguities can only come from the lowest-order piece, the rest being nite by power counting. in
our calculation, the result can be changed by any regularization that destroys either the spherical symmetry (in four-
dimensional euclidean space) of the high-energy behaviour or the steps we followed to arrive at eq. (9). in general,
dierent regularizations (or subtractions) will render dierent results, even if they preserve gauge invariance. this is
apparent in dierential renormalization, which makes the ambiguity explicit [14]. as a matter of fact, independently
of how one regulates and subtracts the divergent integrals, one always has the freedom to add any (renormalizable)
nite counterterm that is allowed by the relevant symmetries of the theory [22]. this is also true when the radiative
corrections to that term are nite [21]. in the present case, this means that the induced (k) can have any value, for
it is not protected by any symmetry [15] (except cpt and lorentz invariance, but we just broke them). the conclusion
of our study is the following:
if the regulator and the subtraction rule are mass-independent, a mass-independent
result will be obtained to all orders in b in the physically-relevant cases, as the cpt- and lorentz-violating terms
coecients are much smaller than the mass of any electromagnetically-charged fermion and eq. (13) provides the
induced term in this situation.

in ref. [2] an interesting discussion was made regarding the possible vanishing of the induced chern-simons term due
to an anomaly-cancellation mechanism in the high-energy theory (of course, we consider now several fermion species).
essentially, the argument goes as follows. from the point of view of a more fundamental theory, the diagrams with
one6 b5 insertion (at one loop) can be viewed as the corresponding triangular diagrams with the same photon legs
and a third leg involving a coupling to an axial vector, in the limit in which there is zero momentum transfer to the
axial-vector leg and the latter is replaced with a vacuum expectation value. the condition for the cancellation of the
anomalies ocurring in these diagrams then implies that the induced term also cancels. this argument requires that the
term induced by dierent fermions be the same. this is true if the induced term contains no mass dependence and,
besides, a universal and mass-independent renormalization prescription is adopted for all the contributing diagrams
(such a prescription can be justied again by a similar argument). our result shows that the rst requirement, which
is trivial at the b-linear order, holds to all orders in b.
invoking the adler-bardeen theorem, the argument for
the vanishing of the induced term was also generalized in ref. [2] to higher loops. again, this is only valid if no
mass-dependence is introduced by higher-order corrections. that this is the case follows from the combination of
coleman-glashows argument and adler-bardeen theorem. summarizing: in the context of ref. [2], the cancellation
of anomalies in the fundamental theory imply the vanishing of the induced term to any order in b and in the
ne-structure constant, if a mass-independent scheme is used.

we have till now neglected the possible inuence of the a term in eq. (1) but, in principle, corrections of order
a2b and higher could appear. actually, one can include the eect of a to all orders by considering the corresponding
a- and b-exact propagator. this propagator is just the one in eq. (5) but with k substituted by k  a. the
vector a behaves then like an external momentum which appears in all the propagators of the loop. since there are
no derivative couplings, a shift in the loop momentum k  k + a can completely eliminate a, so the result is not
aected. this shift is also subjected to regularization ambiguities. as a matter of fact, the term proportional to a
can be eliminated from the action s qed + s cpt by a eld redenition of the form  = exp(ia  x) [1]. the eect of
other sectors (like the cpt-even lorentz-violating extension of qed considered in ref. [2]) can also be studied with
these techniques, i.e., incorporating the corresponding fermion bilinears into the exact propagator. this is beyond
the scope of the present work.

let us nally stress that even if the radiative corrections to the chern-simons term cancel for some reason, it is
still possible to add a nite counterterm and get a non-zero (k). this is a sign of the fact that we have no right to
put k = 0 at tree level, unless there is some symmetry in the high-energy theory that imposes this value. of course,
it is comparison with experiment that tells us to set k + (k) = 0 but, in the absence of a proper symmetry, we
are facing a problem of naturalness. nevertheless, the anomaly-cancellation argument shows that this problem does
not come from other sectors of the low-energy theory, and, from a practical point of view, allows one to put k = 0
in the tree-level action, as long as a consistent mass-independent scheme is used in the calculations.
