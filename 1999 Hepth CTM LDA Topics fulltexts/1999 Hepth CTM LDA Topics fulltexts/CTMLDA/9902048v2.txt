abstract

a gauge invariant formulation for the massive axion is considered.
the axion acquires mass through a topological term which couples a
(pseudo)scalar and a third rank antisymmetric tensor. duality, local
and canonical equivalences with the non-gauge invariant proposal are
established. the supersymmetric version of the gauge invariant model
is constructed.

it is well known that dierent theories can be related by duality transfor-
mations and their classical and quantum properties are equivalent. in four
dimensions a massless (pseudo)scalar eld: the axion, is dual to the antisym-
metric eld bmn (only if derivative couplings are considered). this fact is a
particular case of the general duality between p and d  p  2 forms in d
dimensions. in this sense, it is known that non-perturbative eects break the
pecci-quinn (pq) symmetry of the axion, giving mass to it. then, a natural
question arises, concernig about what happens with the duality symmetry.
this item was an enigma until two independent approaches were developed
recently [1], [2]. in these references the authors show that, though the pq
symmetry is broken, duality symmetry still remains. the bmn eld is re-
placed by a massive antisymmetric eld of third rank cmnp. a characteristic
feature of this duality is the lost of abelian gauge invariance for the new
antisymmetric eld. the duality now corresponds to a particular case of the
usual duality between massive p and d  p  1 forms in d dimensions.

the conection between a massive (pseudo)scalar eld, , and a massive
antisymmetric eld, cmnp has been considered before in dierent contexts

1

[3][4][5][6]. in this letter, we will show that a gauge invariant model, which
involves a topological coupling, considered in reference [4], in the context of
the u(1) problem, is locally equivalent to the non gauge invariant proposal
for the massive axion. this equivalence is analogous to that between the
self-dual [7] and topologically massive [8] models in three dimensions, in
the same manner as the equivalence between the proca and the topologically
massive gauge invariant theories in four dimensions [9] [10]. in the preceding
examples, in three and four dimensions, the connection occurs between a
gauge sensitive and a gauge invariant model. it has been shown that these
models are locally equivalent and one of them is a gauge xed version of
the other [11][9]. nevertheless the global equivalence depends on the coho-
mological structure of the base manifold [12][9][13][14]. for the models that
we compare in this letter we will face this dual equivalence in several ways.
one of them, described below by im 1, is a rst order version of the massive
(pseudo)scalar model. the other model, described below by im 2, is gauge
invariant. we will note that the space of solutions of both models dier in a
topological sector that can be gauged out on trivial manifolds. the presence
of this topological sector appears explicitly in the partiton function of the
gauge invariant model as a topological factor related with the cohomological
structure of the base manifold. we will prove (canonically) that one of the
models is a gauge xed version of the gauge invariant one. in particular, we
will see the equivalence through the existence of a rst order master action,
that will allow us to consider global aspects and interactions. finally we will
construct a supersymmetric formulation of the gauge invariant action of the
massive axion.

an illustrative model for the massive axion is given by the following

master action[5] [15]

i =<

1
2

vmvm + mvm 

m22 >,

1
2

(1)

where vm is a vector eld and  is a scalar eld (<> denotes integra-
tion in four dimensions). eliminating the eld vm through its equation of
motion(vm = m), the action for a massive scalar is obtained, while using
the equation of motion of the scalar eld  ( = 1

m2 mvm), we have

iv =

1
2

< vmvm +

1
m2 (mvm)2 > .

(2)

2

the propagator corresponding to the eld vm is mn  kmkn
k2+m2 , which is just
equal to those discussed in [1]. if we introduce the dual of the vector eld:
vm = 1

3! mmnpqcnpq, we have the following master action

im 1 =< 

1

2.3!

m2c mnpcmnp +

1
3!

mmnpqmcnpq 

1
2

m22 >,

(3)

from which duality is easily infered. to see this, we can use its equations of
motion

mc mnp  mnpqq = 0,

m 

1
3!

mnpqmcnpq = 0,

(4)

(5)

to eliminate cmnp (or ), thus obtaining the action for a massive scalar eld
(or the massive antisymmetric eld cmnp). in any case, there is not gauge
invariance at all. we can ask whether there really exist a gauge invariant
theory compatible with a massive term for the axion eld. the answer is
positive, and the action is

im 2 =< 

1
2

mm 

1

2.4!

gmnpqgmnpq 

m
3!

mnpqcmnpq >,

(6)

where gmnpq  mcnpq ncmpq +pcmnq qcmnp is the eld strength asso-
ciated with the antisymmetric eld cmnp. this action was considered previ-
ously in reference [4] as a generalization to four dimensions of the schwinger
model in two dimensions. this action is invariant, up to a surface term,
under the abelian gauge transformations

cmnp = mnp + npm + pmn,

 = 0.

(7)

and under the global transformation:  = constant. in im2 we note that the
coupling term is a bf topological term. this term preserves the number of
degrees of freedom of the non-interacting terms (just the one connected with
the massless (pseudo)scalar eld), but change the physical characteristic of
the spectrum (the (pseudo)scalar eld becomes massive). this situation is
like the one in three dimension with the topologically massive model where
the topological chern-simons term changes the physical properties of the
maxwell eld (which in three dimensions is a massless scalar) to a massive
spin 1 theory. other example of this situation, in four dimensions, occurs in

3

the cremmer-scherk[16] or topologically massive model where the original
elds are a massless scalar (one degree of freedom) and a photon with helicity
1 (two degrees of freedom) and the resulting theory with the topologiacal
interaction term is a massive spin 1 excitation (three degrees of freedom).

the connection of im2 and the massive (pseudo)scalar is straightforward:
introducing    1
4 mnpqgmnpq as the dual of the strenght eld gmnpq into
the action im 2, we observe that  plays the role of an auxiliary eld, whose
elimination through its equation of motion ( = m) leads to the action of
a massive (pseudo)scalar eld.

it is worth, at this point, to note that since im2 depends only of derivatives
of the scalar eld, then its dual theory can be achieved, replacing m by
2 lm and adding a bf term: 1
1
4 lmmnpqnbpq[17]. the dual action will be [4][6]

id =< 

1

2.4!

gmnpqgmnpq 

1

2.3!

(mcmnp  hmnp)(mc mnp  h mnp) >,

(8)

where hmnp = mbnp + nbpm + pbmn is the eld strength of the antisym-
metric eld bmn, which was introduced in the bf term. this action describes
the interaction of open membranes whose boundaries are closed strings [18]
and is invariant under the following gauge transformations

cmnp = mnp + npm + pmn,

bmn = mn  nm  mmn.

(9)

the  gauge transformation allows us gauged away the antisymmetric eld
bmn, leading to the massive antisymmetric eld cmnp action.

let us, now, see that im2 is locally equivalent to im 1 on-shell. the equa-

tions of motion for im 2 can be written, suggestively, as

mnpqq(mcmnp  mnprr) = 0,

mnpqq(m 

1
3!

rsturcstu) = 0.

(10)

(11)

these equations, are just the result of aplying the dierential operator mnpqq
to the equations of motion derived from im 1: eqs. (4) and (5). from here
the local equivalence can be stated: equations (10) and (11) can be written
locally as

and

mcmnp  mnprr = mnp + npm + pmn,

m 

1
3!

mnpqmcnpq = constant.

(12)

(13)

now, the right sides of (12) and (13) correspond, respectively, to gauge
changes in cmnp and . so those sides are gauge equivalent to zero, leaving
us with equations (4) and (5). in other words the physical relevant solutions
of both models are the same, at the local level. equivalently, closed 0 and
3-forms (m = 0 = [mcnpq]) are always solutions of the equations (10)
and (11), while they become trivial in the model described by im 1. locally,
this closed forms are always exact and then the gauge invariance allow us to
gauge them away. globally, this will depend on the cohomological structure
of the base manifolds and both models may dier in their space of solutions.
we will see later that this topological dependence will appear explicitly in
the partition function.

proceeding with the comparison we will show the canonical equivalence
for these two theories on cohomological trivial region of space-time. for the
non-gauge invariant action im 1, the canonical hamiltonian density is found
to be

m2cijkcijk +

m22 +

ii,

(14)

h1 =

2.3!

1

subject to the set of second class constraints

 = 0 and ijk = ijk 

1
3!

mijk,

(15)

where  and ijk are the canonical conjugated momenta associated to  and
cijk, respectively.

on the other hand, for the gauge invariant action im 2, we have

h2 = 3ijkijk +

1
2

ii +

1
2

[ 

m
3!

ijkcijk]2,

subject to the rst class constraints

jk = iijk 

1
3!

mijki.

(16)

(17)

these constraints are doubly reducible, i.e., there are functions z ij
zk(x, y) such that r dyz ij

k (x, y) and
k (x, z) = 0. this
fact must be taken into account when we want the gauge freedom to be xed.
it is straightforward to show that these two hamiltonian densities are
related by linear combinations of the set of second class constraints of h1,

k (x, y)ij(y) = 0 and r dyz k(x, y)z ij

5

reecting the canonical equivalence:

h2 = h1 + 3ijk[ijk +

1
3

mijk] +

1
2

[ 

1
3

mijkcijk].

(18)

this situation is similar to those theories which involve a mass mechanism
through topological coupling [11][9][12]. moreover, we can see that im 1 is a
gauge xed version of the gauge invariant action im 2. in fact, we note that
ij = kijk can be considered as the rst class constraints and  = 0 as
the gauge xing condition1.
in the latter case the rst order hamiltonian
results to be h2. the canonical procedure continues at this point and then
the quantum equivalence is clear.

now, in order to touch further aspects it is worth looking at the equiva-

lence through the following master action

im = < 

+

1
3!

1

m2amnpamnp 

m22 +

2.3!
mmnpq(amnp  cmnp)q > .

1

mmnpqgmnpq

(19)

independent variations in amnp, , cmnp and  lead to the following equations
of motion

amnp =

mnpqq,

1
m

and

 =

1

4!m

mnpqgmnpq,

mnpqm(  ) = 0

mnpqq(amnp  cmnp) = 0.

(20)

(21)

(22)

(23)

replacing the expressions for amnp and  given by eqs. (20) and (21) into im ,
the gauge invariant action im 2 is obtained. on the other hand, the solutions
of the equations of motion (22) and (23) are

   = , cmnp  amnp = mnp,

(24)

where  and mnp are 0 and 3-closed forms, respectively. locally, we can set

 = constant, mnp  lmnp = mlnp + nlpm + plmn,

(25)

1ijk and iijk have the same information in three space dimensions

6

and substituting into im , we obtain the following stueckelberg type action

1

is = <

1
4!

m2(cmnp  lmnp)(c mnp  lmnp) 

2.3!
mmnpq(  )gmnpq > .

1
2

m2(  )2

(26)

this action is invariant under

cmnp = mnp + npm + pmn,

lmn = mn,

(27)

which allow us to gauge away the lmn eld and recover im 1 (we have redened
   as  since  is a constant).
in this way, the local equivalence is
also stated. on the other hand, we can consider  =    and amnp =
cmnp  mnp as general solutions in order to obtain the following gauge
invariant action

1

im = <

2.3!

mmnpqmnpq > .

(28)

m2(cmnp  mnp)(c mnp  mnp) 

1
2!

m2(  )2

this action is global and locally equivalent to im 2, so the topological sectors,
not present in im 1, are now included. indeed, the equations of motion which
are obtained after performing independent variations on cmnp, mnp,  and
 in im are

m(c mnp  mnp)  mnpqq(  ) = 0
m(c mnp  mnp)  mnpqq = 0

and

m(  ) 

m(  ) 

mnpqmcnpq +

1
3!
mnpqmcnpq = 0,

1
3!
1
3!

mnpqmnpq = 0

(29)

(30)

from which is easily deduced that  and mnp are closed 0 and 3-forms,
respectively, i.e. mnpqq = 0 = mnpqmnpq. taking into account this last
result and applying the dierential operator mnpqq on the set rst order
dierential equations given by (30), the equations of motion for the gauge

7

invariant action im 2 are obtained (equations (10) and (11)). we can say
that im is the correct modication to im1 in order to include the, originally
missing, topological sectors. this aspect will be important when interactions
are to be considered. moreover, we can eliminate  and cmnp to achieve

where

im 1 = im 1[a,]  itop[,],

itop[,] =<

3!

mmnpqmnpq >

(31)

(32)

is the bf term for the topological coupling between 0 and 3-forms in four
dimensions. in other direction, if we couple a source to  and cmnp only,
in (28), it is easy to see that the sum of any solution of the inhomogeneous
equations of im1 with any solution of the inhomogeneous equation of the bf
theory is a solution of the inhomogeneous equation of im2.

from (32) we have that the partition funtions of im 1 and im 2 dier by a

topological factor.

zm 2 = ztopzm 1

(33)

this topological factor is associated with the topologiacal sectors not present
in the space of solutions of im 1. in general, on manifolds with non trivial
topological structure ztop 6= 1. only when the manifold has a trivial struc-
ture, we will have ztop  1, reecting the local and global equivalence (in the
cases of duality equivalence taking into account global aspects see references
[19] [20]).

finally, we will construct the supersymmetric formulation of the gauge
invariant action for the massive axion. for this proposal, we need (anti)chiral
superelds ( and +) and a supereld v whose supersymmetric eld strength
2 (dd + d d)v , where (ddv ) d d is (anti) chiral supereld. this
is g =  1
later supereld describes the cmnp in a supersymmetric way[21]. the super-
symmetric action is

i =

mz d4xd2 d dv +

1
4

1

2 z d4xd2d2 +

1

mz d4xd2 +ddv.

(34)

where the last two terms are the supersymmetric extension of the topological
coupling.
in components (using majorana spinors), this action is written

where (a, b, vm  1
3! mnpqcnpq, d, ) and (a, , , f, g) are the components
of v and  multiplets, respectively. this action describes 8 bosonic and 8
fermionic degrees of freedom and is invariant under the o-shell supersym-
metric transformations

b = i5,

a = i,
v = im,
 = (.v) + 5d + mma  5mma

d = i5mm,

and

 = i5,

a = i,
 = [ma  5m]m + [f + 5g],
f = imm,

g = i5mm.

(36)

(37)

note that the a, a and b bosonic elds also have the same mass as the axion
eld, as can be seen after eliminating the g, d and f auxiliary elds, just
as the dilaton acquire mass in the linear multiplet, in the supersymmetric
formulation for the cremmer-sherk action[22]

sumarizing, we have seen that a gauge invariant description for massive
axions is possible. this gauge invariant description is (locally)equivalent
to the non-gauge invariant proposal. the supersymmetric formulation was
given. a complete brst analysis of the gauge invariant model considered
in this paper is under consideration.
