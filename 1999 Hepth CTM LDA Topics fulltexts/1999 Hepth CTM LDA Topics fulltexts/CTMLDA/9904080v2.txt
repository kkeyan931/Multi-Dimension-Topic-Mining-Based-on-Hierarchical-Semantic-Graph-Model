abstract

the higgs model is generalized so that in addition to the radial
higgs eld there are elds which correspond to the themasy and en-
tropy. the model is further generalized to include state and sign pa-
rameters. a reduction to the standard higgs model is given and how
to break symmetry using a non-zero vev (vacuum expectation value)
is shown. a uid rotation can be performed on the standard higgs
model to give a model dependent on the entropy and themasy and with
a constant mass.

introduction

a perfect uid has a lagrangian formulation in which the lagrangian is the
pressure p. variation is achieved by using the rst law of thermodynamics

dp = n dh  nt ds,

(1)

where n is the particle number, t is the temperature, s is the entropy, and
h the enthalpy. in four dimensions a vector can be decomposed into four
scalars, however the ve scalar decomposition

hva = wa = a + x

i

(i)s(i)a,

vav a = 1,

(2)

(i) = 1, 2 is often used, because for i = 1, s and  = r t d have inter-
pretation, roberts (1997) [3] as the entropy and the thermasy respectively.
from now on the index (i) is suppressed as it is straightforward to reinstate.
replacing the rst law with dp = vadw a  nt ds, variation gives the
familiar stress and scalar evolution equations. previously, roberts (1997)
[3], i have replaced all partial derivatives in the above with vector covariant
derivatives

da = a + ie aa,

(3)

to obtain a generalization of scalar electrodynamics called uid electrody-
namics. for many interacting uids the interaction terms can be disre-
garded, anile (1990) [4], however here all interaction terms are kept. quan-
tization of these models is not looked at here although uids can be quan-
tized, roberts (1999) [5].
in this letter instead of using the rst law a
specic explicit lagrangian is assumed. this xes the equation of state.
since my previous work i have changed my mind on three things. the best

conventions for the scalar decomposition are 2. this is because the space-
time index is put on s as this will allow easier generalization to second order
non-equilibrium thermodynamics, isreal and stewart (1979) [6]. the + con-
vention is used for  and s in 2 (rather than as). the second is that the
uid remains isentropic after charging. the third is that two vector normal-
ization conditions are required after charging. equivalences between uids
and scalar elds were rst studies by tabensky and taub (1973) [7]. ther-
modynamical quantities are introduced into the standard higgs model via
the partition function kapusta (1989) [8]. clearly the entropy, temperature
and so on cannot occur from both the vector 2 and the partition function,
perhaps a suitable partition function for the present model might allow both
to be identied.

an approach which dispenses with higgs elds is that of nicholson and

kennedy (2000) [9].

2 explicit lagrangians

consider the lagrangian

l(q, qa) = (waw a)r  q(q),

(4)

where r is called the equation of state parameter (see equation 9),  is
called the sign parameter and q is the potential. varying with respect to
the metric and then assuming the stress is of the form of a perfect uid
implies

 2(1)rrw 2r2

c wawb = (p + )vavb.

normalization v 2

a = 1 and hva = wa implies

w 2r

c = (1)rh2r.

recall that l = p, together with the above three equations this gives

p = h  q,  = (2r  1)h2r + q, n = 2rh2r1.

varying l with respect to ,  and s respectively

(5)

(6)

(7)

(nv a)a  q = 0,  n s  q = 0,

(nv a)a  q = 0,

(8)

this is a perfect uid; when q = 0 it has the -equation of state

1 <  =

2r

2r  1

< 2,



2  2

= r <

.

(9)

particular cases are r = 1 which implies  = 2 which is the equation of state
for coherent radiation; and r = 2 which implies  = 4
3 which is the equation
of state for incoherent radiation. the canonical momenta are

 = n,  = 0, s = n.

(10)

the constrained hamiltonian is

h = (  +  s) + 1(s  ) + 2  l,

(11)

where 1 and 2 are the lagrange multipliers. the momenta and hamil-
tonian are the same as in the general case. in the general case the euler
equations and the canonical stress vanish identically; however for explicit
lagrangians the euler equations are the same as 8 and the canonical stress
is the same as the stress.

3 charged explicit lagrangian.

all partial derivatives are replaced by vector covariant derivative 1. capital
letters are used for the new quantities and small letters for the uncharged
quantities. the lagrangian becomes

l  l = (waw a)r  q(q) 

f 2,

4

(12)

where  denotes complex conjugate. the vector eld becomes

wa = a + sa + i( + s)eaa = wa + iaa,

(13)

where   ( + s)e. under the global transformations

  exp(ie),

s  exp(ie)s,

  , aa  aa + a,

(14)

the vector eld changes to wa  exp(ie)wa so that waw a is invariant,
implying that the lagrangian is invariant. one can choose that aa = 0 and
then these transformations are local. letting   (x), l  l((x), . . .),
l
 = 0 usually implies a noether current, in the present case this procedure
gives

l


= 2(waw a),

(15)

4

but it is dicult to call this a current as it does not depend on qa. one can
introduce two normalization conditions

vav a = 1,

vava = 1,

h 2 = h2  e2a2
a,

(16)

(17)

which imply

proceeding as before

f 2,  = (2r 1)h 2r + q+

f 2, n = 2rh 2r1,
(18)

and the canonical momenta are

 = n,  = 0, s = n , aa = 0,

(19)

the last of which is surprising; because not all the components of aa vanish
in usual gauged scalar electrodynamics. the stress is

tab = n h(vav 

b + v 

a vb) + p gab,

=

n
h

(wawb + e2aaab) + p gab,

t = 3p  ,

vavbtab =  + e

the conservation law is

a + (vaaa)2(cid:17) .

t b

the constrained hamiltonian is

(20)

(21)

h = (  +  s) + 1(s  ) + 2 + 3aa  l,

note that if one starts with the electrodynamical lagrangian l = f 2/4
and tries to implement a substitution scheme from this via aa  aa + kwa
one cannot recover the above type of charged uids because f 2  f 2+
second derivatives in the scalar elds, which do not occur in the above.
thus there is no mirror mechanism.

4 comparison with the higgs model

to recover scalar electrodynamics rst note that

waw a = w2

a + 2a2
a.

(24)

now set the state parameter r = 1, the sign parameter  = 1, and the
potential q(q) = v (2) so that

l = w2

a + 2a2

a  v (2) 

f 2,

(25)

which has no cross term waaa. now set  = ,  = s = 0. changing the
gauge a
a = a + aa and dropping the prime gives sel (scalar electrodynam-
ics) in radial form. this has lagrangian, stress and equations of motion

respectively. giving the higgs eld a non-zero expectation value < 0||0 >=
a.  transfers to

and the lagrangian becomes

   =  + a,

the term a2e2a2

a is a constant mass term.

for a uid one can perform a scalar uid rotation

   =  + s.

(29)

starting with sel and identifying  with  does not give one of the above uids
as gradients in  appear. alternatively there is the vector uid rotation

a = a  wa.

(30)

starting with sel and performing this rotation and replacing  with 
e gives a
uid of the above type. one can then assume a vev < 0| 
e |0 > to generate
a constant mass term as above, the dierence being that some account of
thermodynamics has been achieved.
