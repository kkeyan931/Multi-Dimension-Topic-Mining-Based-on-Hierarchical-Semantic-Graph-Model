abstract

we determine all the terms that are gauge-invariant up to a total
spacetime derivative (semi-invariant terms) for gauged non-linear
sigma models g/h where h is compact or semi-simple. we show
that (non-trivial) such terms exist only in odd dimensions and are
equivalent to the familiar chern-simons terms for the subgroup h.
various applications are mentioned, including one to the gauging of
the wess-zumino-witten terms in even spacetime dimensions. our
approach is based on the analysis of the descent equation associated
with semi-invariant terms.

1 introduction

the lagrangian of a dynamical system invariant under a given symmetry
is invariant itself up to a total spacetime derivative, l = k. in some
cases, one can redene the lagrangian without modifying its euler-lagrange
derivatives, l  l = l + l, so that the new lagrangian is strictly in-
variant, l = 0. in other cases, however, this is impossible. a well-known
example is the chern-simons term for yang-mills theory in odd spacetime
dimensions [1], which is invariant only up to an unremovable total derivative.
terms for which m = k but m 6= m  m with m = 0 are some-
times called (non trivial) semi-invariant terms and we shall adopt here this
convenient terminology.

given a theory, it is important to know all the terms that can be added
to the action without destroying the assumed symmetries. while the iden-
tication of the manifestly invariant terms is usually rather straightforward,
it is in general more dicult to determine systematically the semi-invariant
ones. the purpose of this letter is to solve this question for gauged non-linear
sigma models g/h, where g is the gauge group. as it is well known, these
models occur repeatedly in supergravity [2, 3, 4].

our work is motivated by the beautiful paper [5], where a method for
constructing a new class of semi-invariant terms in even spacetime dimen-
sions, with topological connotation, is described. as pointed out there, a
necessary condition for these terms to exist is that g be non semi-simple.
the question was further studied in [6], where it was proved that if h reduces
to the identity (principal case), then, no matter what g is, the terms of
[5] dier from strictly gauge-invariant terms by a total derivative and thus
are not truly semi-invariant. we show here that this conclusion remains
valid whenever h is compact or semi-simple. in fact, the only available non-
trivial semi-invariant terms are then the chern-simons terms based on the
subgroup h, but these exist only in odd dimensions. more precisely, any
semi-invariant term is proportional to a chern-simons term up to terms that
are strictly gauge-invariant and up to a total derivative. thus, under the as-
sumption that h is compact or semi-simple, non-trivial semi-invariant terms
are exhausted by the familiar chern-simons family.

our approach is based on the analysis of the brst descent equation

associated with semi-invariant terms.

2 description of -models

we denote the yang-mills connection by aa
 , the gauge group by g and its
lie algebra by g. the lie group g may be non-compact since non-compact
groups are typically the rule in supergravity. in addition to the sigma-model
variables, we allow for the presence of matter elds yi transforming in some
linear representation of g.

we assume that g (the gauge group) acts transitively on the space m of
the non-linear sigma model2, which can thus be identied with the homoge-
neous coset space g/h where h is the isotropy subgroup at some reference
point on m. the subgroup h is assumed to be compact or semi-simple.

first, we recall a few properties of coset spaces. for that matter, it is
convenient to split the generators ta of g into two sets, the generators of the
lie algebra of h (h) and the remaining ones,

ta = {t, ta},

(2.1)

where capital latin indices refer to g, small greek indices to h and small latin
indices to k  g  h. the commutators

[ta, tb] = f c

abtc,

[t, t] = f 

t

(2.2)

dene the structure constants of g and h respectively. because h is semi-
simple or compact, the coset space is reductive. this means that one can
choose the supplementary generators ta so that the commutators [ta, t]
involve only the tbs,

[ta, t] = f c

atc.

(2.3)

thus, the structure constants f 
resentation of h.

a vanish and the generators ta dene a rep-

2if the gauge group does not act transitively on the manifold m of the scalar elds,
then m splits into g-orbits of the form g/h where the isotropy subgroup h depends in
general on the orbits. in a stratum where the isometry subgroup is constant, one may
locally introduce coordinates that parametrize the points in the coset space g/h and
coordinates that are constant along the orbits. these latter transform in the trivial linear
representation of g and can simply be included among the yis. thus, our analysis applies
also to this more general situation (and in particular, to the case where one gauges only a
subgroup of g, provided the relevant isotropy subgroup is compact or semi-simple). how
to patch strata together may presumably be achieved along the lines of [3], but we have
not investigated this question here.

coset representatives may be taken to be of the form

u() = exp{ata},

(2.4)

with some real elds a, the number of which equals the dimension of g/h.
the a provide local coordinates in the vicinity of a = 0. we shall in a
rst approach restrict the sigma-model elds to be in a star-shaped neigh-
bourhood of a = 0. how to deal with global features (which are easily
incorporated) is discussed in the conclusions.

the group g acts on the left as

gu() = u( )h(, g)

(2.5)

with g  g and h  h (note that right action conventions were adopted in
[6]). the innitesimal transformation property of the local parameters a is
derived through the parametrization

g = exp{ata}, h(, g) = exp{u(, )t}

if l is invariant under gauge transformations up to a total derivative,

(3.1)

then k itself is not arbitrary but subject to some denite conditions obtained
by evaluating the commutators of the second variations of l.

(3.5)

where the matrices ya are the generators of the representation of the ys,
[ya, yb] = f a
bcyc, and where c a are the ghosts. the brst dierential acts
also on the so-called antields. since we are interested only in terms that are
o-shell gauge invariant (up to a total divergence), we shall, however, not
include them. comments on more general deformations are briey given at
the end.

local forms are exterior forms on spacetime which depend on the elds,
the ghosts and their derivatives. a density l that is gauge-invariant up to
a total divergence denes, in dual terms, a local n-form with ghost number
zero that is -closed modulo d,

a + db = 0.

a redenition of l by a total divergence is clearly equivalent to

a  a + c + de

(3.6)

(3.7)

since there is no form in negative ghost number in the absence of antields
(c  0). the question under study is thus equivalent to determining whether
elements in the cohomology h 0(|d) have a representative that is strictly
-exact.

the advantage of reformulating the question in these cohomological terms
is that there are well-developed techniques for handling the brst cohomol-
ogy h 0(|d). the idea is that the equation (3.6) implies b + de = 0 for
some (n  2)-form e of ghost number two. by continuing in the same way,
one gets a chain of equations a + db = 0, b + de = 0, e + df = 0 (the
descent), the last two of which read m+ dn = 0 and n = 0. if n is trivial
in h(), n = u, then one can absorb it in redenitions (m  m = m  du
and n  n  u = 0) and shorten the descent by one step, the last equation
being now m = 0.

in a rst stage, one thus determines all non trivial solutions of n = 0,
without restriction on the ghost number. in a second stage, one determines
which among these solutions can be lifted all the way back up to form-degree
n. both problems have been studied in the literature.

4 the -cohomology

our strategy for computing the -cohomology is to perform an appropriate
change of variables in the jet-space coordinatized by the elds, the ghosts

5

and their derivatives. this change of variables is adapted to the symmetry
and combines the analysis of [7] for coset models with ungauged symmetry
with the change of variables of [6] for the gauged principal models.

the starting point is the observation that if one decomposes the lie

algebra-valued form u()1(d + a)u() in the basis (ta, t),

u()1(d + a)u() = pa(, a)ta + v(, a)t,

(4.1)

one generates a quantity pa
eld v

 that behaves as an h-gauge connection,

 that is covariant under the action of h, and a

pa
v

 = f a
bpb
v
 = f 
d + d

d

(4.2)

(4.3)

the ghosts d are identical to the u(, ) that occured in the parametriza-
tion of h(, g), with the gauge parameters a being replaced by the ghosts
c a,

b()c b.
the nilpotence of  requires the d to transform as

d() = u(, c) = 

d = 

1
2

f 
dd

(4.4)

(4.5)

we complete the redenition of the ghosts by introducing the abelian ghosts
da, which are the brst variations of the coset space coordinates a,

da = a = a

b()c b, da = 0

(4.6)

this redenition of the ghosts is clearly invertible in the vicinity of the iden-
b() is invertible. thus, one can trade the c a for the
tity, since the matrix a
da,

da = a

b()c b, c a = a

b()db.

(4.7)

the h-connection v can be used to construct a v-covariant derivative of p,

d(v)

 p = p + [v, p], d(v)

 p = [d(v)

 p, d]

(4.8)

the sux v has been introduced to distinguish d(v)


from d(a)
 .

the crucial observation now is that one can use (4.1) to express the
 (in

 in terms of the variables a, a, pa

yang-mills connection aa

 and v

6

a of (2.9), which is invertible. the relation aa

the vicinity of the identity). indeed, the matrix multiplying aa
matrix kb
may clearly be prolonged to the derivatives of aa
pressed in an invertible way through the ordinary derivatives of a and v
well as the v-covariant derivatives of pa
the original ghosts c a and the redened ones, c a = a
prolonged to the subsequent derivatives.

 in (4.1) is the
, v
 )
 , which thus may be ex-
 as
. furthermore, the relation between
bdb, may also be

 (a, a, pa

 = aa

in the same way, all the linearly transforming elds yi may be combined
with the coset representative u() written in the adequate representation,
to form h-covariant elds together with their v-covariant derivatives.
if
for instance yi transforms in the representation d of g generated by (ya)i
j,
y  = d(g)y, then the quantity y = d(u 1())y transforms only under h,
y  = d(h)y, with h given by (2.5). in terms of the brst dierential,  yi =
j yjd. the v-covariant derivative d(v) y shares the same transformation
y i
property.

thus, one may take as redened set of jet-space coordinates the local
coset coordinates a and the new ghosts da, together with their ordinary
derivatives; the h-gauge connection v
 with its ordinary derivatives; and the
h-covariant quantities pa

 and yi with their v-covariant derivatives.

the variables a and da form brst contractible pairs since a = da and
da = 0. the same is true for their derivatives. thus the brst cohomology
involves only the h-connection v
 and the the ghosts d, as well as the h-
covariant objects pa
 and yi, together with their v-covariant derivatives. the
problem of computing h() for the yang-mills + gauged non-linear sigma
model g/h with gauge group g is thus reduced to the problem of computing
h() for a yang-mills model with gauge group h and elds transforming in
some denite linear representation of h. this is a well-known problem whose
solution may be found in [8, 9, 10]. let [ ]c denote the h-covariant elds pa
,
yi and f (v)
and their successive v-covariant derivatives. then, any -cocycle
takes the form

(d) stands for a basis of the

5 -cocycles modulo d

the previous analysis provides the -cohomology for all values of the ghost
numbers. in particular, at ghost number zero (no lie
(d) in (4.9)), one sees
that the most general gauge-invariant polynomial is an invariant polynomial
in the h-covariant elds pa
, yi and their covariant derivatives. there
are no other strictly invariant terms.

, f (v)



i

to determine the terms that are gauge-invariant only up to a total di-
vergence, one must, through the descent equation, determine the possible
bottoms (solutions of a = 0) that can be lifted. again, this problem has
been systematically studied [8, 9, 10] with the result that the most general
solution of the equation a + db = 0 is given, at ghost number zero, by

a = c + cs + dm

(5.1)

where c is stricly invariant (c = 0) and thus of the above form while
cs stands for a linear combination with constant coecients of the chern-
simons terms for the eective gauge group h, which are available only in
odd dimensions. the chern-simons terms do not involve the matter elds
yi or pa
 and their derivatives, but only the vector potential v and its eld
strength. in particular, one way rewrite the chern-simons terms for g as
chern-simons terms for h modulo strictly gauge-invariant terms and total
derivatives.

similarly, the terms constructed in [5], which are dened in even dimen-
sions, dier from strictly gauge-invariant terms by total divergences. this
was explicitly veried in [6] in the principal case with abelian gauge group.
a non-abelian example follows from the analysis of [12]. the gauge group
is three-dimensional and its lie algebra reads

[t0, t1] = 2t1,

[t0, t2] = t2,

[t1, t2] = 0.

(5.2)

the subgroup generated by t0 is non-compact.

8

the construction of [5] relies on a non-trivial cocycle ca,bc of the lie-
algebra cohomology with value in the symmetric tensor product of the adjoint
representation, which we take to be as in [12]

c1,22 = 2, c2,12 = c2,21 = 1,

(5.3)

others vanish. besides the yang-mills eld, we consider the eld a taking
value in the group g (principal case). the corresponding semi-invariant
terms take the form

sab(a)f a  f b +

2
3

ca,bcaa  ab  (dac 

3
8

f c
dead  ae)

(5.4)

one easily veries that (5.4) is gauge-invariant up to a non-vanishing surface
term provided sab = sba transforms as

sab = (2sc(af c

b)d + cd,ab)d

one may take for sab()

s00 = 2(2)21, s01 =

1
2

(2)2, s02 = 212,

s11 = 0, s12 = 2, s22 = 21

(5.5)

(5.6)

(5.7)

up to terms that transform homogeneously and clearly lead to strictly gauge-
invariant contributions to the action. in this case (5.4) reads explicitly

2(2)21f 0  f 0 + (2)2f 0  f 1  412f 0  f 2
22f 1  f 2 + 21f 2  f 2 + 2a1  a2  da2

(5.8)

by a direct calculation, one easily checks that (5.8) diers from the strictly

gauge-invariant term

2p1  p2  dp2

(5.9)

by a total derivative. here, the pas are the invariant one-forms

p0 = i 0, p1 = (exp 20)[i 1 + 21i 0], p2 = (exp 0)[i 2  2i 0]

(5.10)

with

i 0 = d0  a0,
i 1 = d1  21d0  a1,
i 2 = d2 + 2d0  a2.

9

(5.11)

even though ca,bc denes a non-trivial lie-algebra cohomological class (for
g), there is no obstruction in rewriting (5.8) in a manifestly gauge-invariant
way by adding a total derivative. the algebraic obstructions for doing so
are given by the lie-algebra cohomology of h, and are absent here.
[in
addition, as mentioned in the conclusions, the de rham cohomology of g
controls whether the construction done in a star-shaped neighbourhood of the
identity in eld space can be extended to the whole of of the eld manifold.
there is no problem here since the de rham cohomology of g is trivial; and
indeed, (5.9) is globally dened.]

6 gauged wess-zumino-witten terms

the wess-zumino-term [13, 14] for the ungauged non-linear model g/h in
n spacetime dimensions reads

w = zx

h

(6.1)

where x is a (n + 1)-dimensional manifold with spacetime as boundary and
where h is a closed (n + 1)-form on g/h that is invariant under g,

lah = 0, dh = 0.

(6.2)

in (6.1), h is the pull-back of h to x. one may write h = db locally in
eld space. thus, one can transform (6.1) as a n-dimensional integral over
spacetime

w = z dnxba1...an((x))1a12a2    nan1...n

(6.3)

for congurations of the elds in a star-shaped neighbourhood of  = 0.

because h is invariant under g, the n-form b is invariant under g up to

a total derivative

lab = dka

(6.4)

this guarantees that the wess-zumino-witten term is (semi-)invariant under
the rigid g-transformations generated by the killing vectors a
a. again, it
may not be possible to add a total derivative to the integrand of (6.3) to
make it strictly g-invariant. there may be algebraic restrictions for doing

10

this, independently of whether b can be globally dened in the whole of g/h.
for instance, a non-zero translation-invariant (= constant) (n + 1)-form in
rk is closed and cannot be written as the exterior derivative of a translation-
invariant n-form since the exterior derivative of a constant n-form vanishes.
the obstruction exists even though the de rham cohomology of rk is trivial.
one says that the wzw term (6.1) can be gauged if one can add to it
terms involving the g-connection aa
 so as to make it invariant under a local
g-transformation up to a total derivative. we claim that in even spacetime
dimensions, the wzw term can be gauged if and only if one can make the
integrand of (6.3) strictly invariant under g-transformations by adding to it
a total derivative. in that case, the gauging is of course direct. if one cannot
replace b by a strictly gauge-invariant term, the gauging is impossible.

this is an immediate consequence of our analysis. in even dimensions,
there is no chern-simons term and all semi-invariant terms dier from strictly
invariant ones by total derivatives. thus, in particular, the gauged wzw
term (if it exists) takes the form w zwgauged = r (invariant + dk). setting
the connection aa
 equal to zero in this relationship yields the desired result.
note that the argument does not work in odd spacetime dimensions. there
are gaugeable wzw terms that are not described by invariant forms b. upon
gauging, these lead to the chern-simons terms for h, an information that
one can use to explicitly construct them.

this fact can be veried explicitly in two dimensions, where the conditions
for gauging are rather simple [15, 16]. the 3-form h on g/h leads to a g-
gaugeable wzw term if and only if it fullls

for some 1-forms va on g/h that are required to obey

iah = dva

as well as

iavb + ib va = 0

lavb = f c

abvc.

now, the algebraic condition (6.6) implies that va takes the form

va = iab

11

(6.5)

(6.6)

(6.7)

(6.8)

for some 2-form b on g/h that is uniquely determined from va. substituting
(6.8) into (6.7) yields then

ib (lab) = 0.

(6.9)

since the group g is transitive, the killing vectors span the whole tangent
space to g/h, so this implies

lab = 0.

(6.10)

inserting (6.8) into (6.5) and using (6.10)
the 2-form b is thus invariant.
shows then that h is the exterior derivative of an invariant 2-form. a dier-
ent way to arrive at the same conclusion is to consider the descent associated
with (6.3) and to observe that there is no element in h() with ghost number
two and form-degree zero, or ghost number one and form-degree one, which
could serve as non trivial bottom. thus, the descent is eectively trivial and
one may redene the integrand of (6.3) to make it strictly invariant.

7 comments and conclusions

our results are somewhat disappointing because they show that the familiar
h-chern-simons terms exhaust all semi-invariant terms when h is compact
or semi-simple. there are no others.
in particular, in even dimensions,
the construction of [5] provides semi-invariant terms that turn out to be
equivalent to strictly invariant ones. in retrospect, this is perhaps not too
surprising since one knows that g-invariance boils down to h-invariance in
the coset space case g/h with reductive embedding of h. to get new terms,
one needs thus to consider more general situations.

the above analysis assumed that the eld variables of the sigma-model
were restricted to a (star-shaped) neighbourhood of the identity. one may
easily take into account the non-trivial topology of eld space along the
lines of [17, 6]. the most convenient way to doing so is to work in the
lifted formulation, in which the sigma-model variables are g-elements and
the right action of h is gauged by means of a gauge eld without kinetic term.
one just nds, besides the chern-simons terms, additional semi-invariant
terms, namely the g-winding number terms. these well-known terms are
the pull-back to spacetime of representatives of the de rham cohomological

12

classes of g. like -terms, they can be written (locally in eld space but not
globally) as total divergences and do not contribute therefore to the equations
of motion. chern-simons like terms are not of this type since they do modify
the equations of motion and thus can be detected even in a local approach in
eld space. the details are given in [18], where the inclusion of the antields
is also treated and shown not to alter the main conclusions. one can, also in
the presence of antields, reduce the problem to the much studied standard
yang-mills problem with gauge group h.
