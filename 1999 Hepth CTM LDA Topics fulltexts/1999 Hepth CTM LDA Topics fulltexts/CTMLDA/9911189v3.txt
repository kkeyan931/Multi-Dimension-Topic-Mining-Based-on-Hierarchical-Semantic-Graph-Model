abstract. we show how to determine the unknown functions arising when the
peeling decomposition is applied to multi-critical matter coupled to two-dimensional
quantum gravity and compute the loop-loop correlation functions. the results that
 = 2 + 2/(2k  3) and  = 1  3/2k agree with the slicing decomposition, and
satisfy fisher scaling.

1 introduction

one of the outstanding problems in the theory of two-dimensional quantum gravity
is the eect of matter elds on the hausdor dimension. in models of discretized
two-dimensional quantum gravity we dene the grand canonical partition function
for an ensemble of graphs (which for the moment we assume are triangulations) g
by

e|g|wg

(1)

z() =xgg

where |g| denotes the number of triangles in g, and wg the partition function of
any matter elds in the theory on the graph g (for an introduction to this material
see for example [1]). to dene the hausdor dimension [2, 3] we rst dene the
geodesic distance dg(i, j) between two links i and j as the minimum number of
triangles which must be traversed to get from the centre of one link to the centre of
the other. then we introduce the two-point function

h(r, ) =xgg

e|g|wg xi,jg

(dg(i, j)  r).

we expect that h has the asymptotic behaviour [3, 4]
m()r >> 1,
m()1 >> r >> 1,

h(r, )  em()r,
 r1g ,

where, as   c, the mass gap vanishes as

m()  (  c)g.

(2)

(3)

(4)

in general it is also convenient to consider a more general correlation function be-
tween boundary loops of length l1 and l2; (2) is essentially the correlator for minimum
length loops. note that it follows from (2) that

xr

h(r, ) = xgg

e|g||g|2wg

 (  c)str

(5)

where, in unitary theories, str is the string susceptibility exponent, and inserting
the form (3) we conclude that

g(2  g) = str

(6)

which is the fisher scaling relation. at least in unitary theories the hausdor
dimension dh is given by dhg = 1 and has the geometrical meaning that in the

1

continuum limit the average volume is related to the geodesic size by hv i  rdh
[1].

analytic calculations of the scaling behaviour of the correlation functions (2)
were rst done by means of the slicing decomposition introduced by kawai et al [2]
and then somewhat later watabiki [5] introduced the peeling decomposition. for
pure gravity (ie wg = 1, str = 1/2) both peeling and slicing decompositions keep
track of the geodesic distance and give the same results which tell us directly that
the hausdor dimension of the ensemble is 4.

when matter elds are introduced the situation becomes more complicated. the
time scale, usually called the string time t, introduced in the decompositions that
have been formulated is no longer by construction the geodesic distance, nor indeed
are the time scales for dierent decompositions necessarily equivalent. however the
above discussion of correlation functions can be repeated in terms of the string time
t instead of the geodesic distance r leading to another pair of exponents,  and ,
which are also expected to satisfy the fisher scaling relation. for example in the
c = 2 model the scaling with string time has been calculated completely by the
peeling decomposition [6] with the result that  = 1
2 which would imply that dh = 2
if the string time and geodesic distance are proportional.
in fact high precision
numerical calculations [7] nd dh = 3.58  0.04 in agreement with the formula [8]

dh = 2

25  c + 49  c
25  c + 1  c

(7)

derived using scaling arguments for diusion in liouville theory. for unitary matter
complete calculations have not been made but it seems that  = ||str/2 [9]; the
implied value of dh is in contradiction with the results of numerical simulations
which suggest that dh is close to 4 [10] but are not in particularly good agreement
with (7) either. it seems certain that when matter is present the string time and the
geodesic distance have dierent scaling dimensions but the relation between them
is unknown.

in this paper we will be concerned with the matrix models with a critical point
corresponding to the (p, q) = (2, 2k  1), k = 2, 3, 4, . . . multi-critical models cou-
pled to quantum gravity [11, 12]. for k > 2 the ensemble of graphs g now allows
polygons with {4, . . . 2k} sides and there are k independent coupling constants,
with polygons of order {6, 10, 14, . . .} having negative weights which makes the mod-
els non-unitary. the partition function is again dened by

z() =xgg

e|g|wg

(8)

where now g denotes the number of polygons,  is the coupling constant conjugate to

2

the number of polygons, and wg depends on the remaining k1 coupling constants
of the theory. k = 2 corresponds to pure gravity; the second coupling constant
which appears in this matrix model is conjugate to the length of the boundary of the
graph. since there are now in general many couplings, there are many correlation
functions which are second derivatives with respect to the couplings so there are
many susceptibilites. we dene the susceptibility

 

2z()
2

e|g||g|2wg

= xgg
 (  c)

(9)

where the exponent  is known to take the value k 1 at the multicritical point.
the string time, tg(i, j), separating two links is now dened as the minimum number
of polygons which must be traversed to get from the centre of one link to the centre
of the other and the two-point function is dened as

h(t, ) =xgg

e|g|wg xi,jg

(tg(i, j)  t).

(10)

we expect (and shall conrm) that, if all the couplings except  are set to their
values at the multi-critical point, h has the asymptotic behaviour

h(t, )  em()t,
 t1,

m()t >> 1,
m()1 >> t >> 1,

where, as   c, the mass gap vanishes as

m()  (  c).

(11)

(12)

and that the fisher scaling relation (which may be obtained by similar manipulations
as before)

(2  ) = 

(13)

is satised. one could hold that t is still the geodesic distance but this is slightly
problematic for large k; it implies that all sides of a given polygon, no matter how
many sides it has, are separated from one another by geodesic distance 1 and we shall
argue in section 6 that the continuum limit of t is not a sensible continuum geodesic
distance. these models have been analyzed using the slicing decomposition in the
same way as pure gravity [13] and they have also been considered using the peeling
decomposition in the scaling limit but the discretized equations have not been solved
completely [5, 14].
in this paper we will examine their peeling decomposition in
detail and explain how to solve completely the non-trivial dierential equations that

arise. we have two motivations for this; to check whether the results are indeed the
same as for slicing, and the intrinsic interest of the method of solution.

this paper is structured as follows. in section 2 we briey describe the standard
peeling calculation for pure gravity and then derive the evolution equation for the
multi-critical models. in section 3 we consider the k = 2 case and show that it
always gives the standard pure gravity results. then in section 4 we show in detail
how to calculate the  exponent for k = 4 and describe how the calculation extends
to all higher even k. in section 5 we explain how to calculate  for all even k and
in section 6 we give our conclusions.

2 the peeling decomposition and evolution equa-

tions

we start by reviewing the calculation in [5] for the simplest pure gravity model
which has matrix model potential

u() =

1

g3.

(14)

the matrix model generates the dual graphs to the triangulations g (see equation
(1)) with g = e and wg = 1. the schwinger dyson equation for connected greens
functions is obtained by marking one external line and pulling it out to expose the
vertex to which it is attached [15], see g.(1). in the peeling decomposition we assign
a time variable to this process; a single iteration advances t by an amount 1/n so
that we obtain

an(t + 1/n) = n,2 + gan+1(t) + g

am(t)anm+1(t).

(15)

nxm=1

we are interested in the loop-loop correlation function; suppose for the moment that
at t = 0 the entry loop is a one-loop and form the quantity

gn(t) =

an(t)
a1(0)

(16)

t

figure 2: the two-loop function in spherical topology.

which is the amplitude for an exit n-loop at time t given an entry 1-loop at time
t = 0. dierentiating (15) we obtain

gn(t + 1/n) = ggn+1(t) + 2g

nxm=1

am(t)gnm+1(t).

(17)

if we restrict to spherical topology then am(t) may be replaced by the disk amplitude
for m legs, am, because the branch can never rejoin the main tube (see g.(2)). the
next step is to approximate the time by a continuous variable to obtain the evolution
equation

gn(t) +

n

dgn(t)

dt

= ggn+1(t) + 2g

with the initial condition that

nxm=1

amgnm+1(t)

(18)

gn(0) =

an(0)
a1(0)

= n,1.

(19)

note that by dierentiating (18) we can show iteratively that all the derivatives of
gn(t) at t = 0 are nite. dening the generating function

g(t, x) =

g
t



= x

equation (18) becomes

where

f (x) = 2ga(x) + g  x,

(21)

(22)

and the form of the disk amplitude

a(x) =

anxn

xn=1

(23)

is known [9]. note that the function f (x) contains just the universal scaling part of
the amplitude a(x); it is given by

f (x) = (f  x)(1  8f g  4gx)

1

2

where f is the root of the cubic

(1  8f g)f 2  g2 = 0

(24)

(25)

which is positive and vanishes as g  0.
evolution equation which gives

it is then straightforward to solve the

f (x)

u(t + j(x))

f (x)

and the function u(y) is xed by the initial conditions to satisfy

1 =

1

f (x)

u(j(x)).

this leads to the scaling behaviour at large y

where we have suppressed various constant factors; so we deduce  = 1
in agreement with the fisher scaling relation [3].

4 and  = 4

now we turn to the multi-critical models for which we will use the notation of

reference [16]. the potential for the k-th multi-critical model is given by

u() = 2 +

gk
p 2p

kxp=1

where the couplings at the multicritical point are

this time we will deal with disconnected graphs. the evolution equation follows
from the schwinger-dyson equation, shown in g.3, just as in the pure gravity case;
we obtain the evolution equation

(34)

gn,m(0) = n,m.

(35)

again, note that by dierentiating (34) we can show iteratively that all the deriva-
tives of gn,m(t) at t = 0 are nite.

dening the generating function

gm(x, t) =

xngn,m(t)

xn=1

(36)

we obtain the partial dierential equation

(37)

at this stage we should make several remarks. firstly that one reason for dealing
with the disconnected graphs is technical convenience; the required disk amplitudes
are known and take a simple form [16], and the structure of the evolution equations is
similar to the 3 case. however it is also very clear that because the graph ensemble
is disconnected there is no direct correspondence between the string time t and a
geodesic distance  the latter can only be sensibly dened on connected graphs.
these equations are more dicult to solve than the pure gravity example reviewed
above because of the presence of the a priori unknown functions gj,m(t) which have
to be determined by the self-consistency and analyticity properties of the solutions.
we will work our way through the problem in a number of steps. first we will study
the solution in the k = 2 case and show that it gives the standard pure gravity
results.

3 universality in the k = 2 case

it is simpler to work at the multi-critical points initially and to compute the 
exponent directly at the critical point; we leave the  exponent for section 5. for
the k = 2 multi-critical model we have

gm
t

= x



x(cid:0)gm(2x2a(x)  1  2g2

(38)

(39)

(40)

(41)

with the initial condition

gm(0, x) = xm.

the potential (30) is an even function of the elds and therefore gn,m(t), which
is the amplitude for an entrance m-loop and exit n-loop, can only be non-zero of n
and m are both odd or both even. thus if m is odd there is an unknown function
on the r.h.s. of (40) whereas if m is even there is no such problem; we will consider
the even and odd cases separately.

8

3.1 even m

when m is even g1,m(t) = 0 and we can solve (40) immediately to obtain

gm(t, x) =

x

f (x)

u(t + j(x))

where

f (x) =

j(x) =

4(cid:16)(1  4x2) 1

2  1(cid:17) ,

and the function u(y) is determined by the initial condition (41)

thus we obtain

for large y and hence

xm =

for even n and m so that  = 4 as expected for all these amplitudes.

3.2 odd m

when m is odd g1,m(t) 6= 0 and the presence of the unknown function on the r.h.s.
of (40) complicates matters; however this is more typical of the general multi-critical
models than the even m case and so we shall study it in some detail. although the
dierential equation can of course still be solved in the t domain it is more convenient
to work with the laplace transformed correlation functions

gn,m(t)estdt

gm(s, x) =

gm(t, x)estdt.

gn,m(s) =z

taking the laplace transform of (40) we obtain the equation

sgm(s, x)  xm1 =



x(cid:0)gm(s, x)f (x)(cid:1) +

1
3x2 g1,m(s).

(49)

the function gm(s, x) has a power series expansion in x

gm(s, x) =xn

xn1gn,m(s)

(50)

which we expect from (49) and (43) to have nite radius of convergence 1
2; within the
radius of convergence the coecients are the laplace transforms of the correlation
functions. unless the gn,m(t) grow faster than exponentially at large t, something
we do not expect, their laplace transforms gn,m(s) will have an asymptotic series
representation at large s. this series can be obtained by successive integration by
parts of the denition (47); as we observed in section 2, gn,m(t) and all its (nite
order) derivatives are nite at t = 0 so we obtain the formal series

gn,m(s) =

sxk=0

(51)

(of course the k depend on n and m but we will always suppress such dependence
for clarity.) we will now show that imposing the condition that the coecients
in the x expansion of gm(s, x) behave like (51) at large s is sucient to x the
unknown function g1,m(s).

it is more convenient to impose the condition on the integral of gm(s, x),

that is to say the small x, large s, expansion of gm contains no terms o(1) or higher

c1(x) = 0.

any pair ck(x) and ck+1(x), with k > 0 are related in the same way and so it is
straightforward to proceed inductively to show that all ck>0(x) are zero.

it is clear that g1,m(s) is positive for all real, positive s and straightforward to
check that its second derivative with respect to s diverges logarithmically as s  0;

at large t. the remaining integrals in (49) yield functions which are analytic in s in
the neighbourhood of the origin provided x < xc. thus we can conclude that

gn,m(t) 

1
t3

(62)

for all odd n and m. so the result  = 4 is universal for all amplitudes gn,m(t) in
agreement with every other calculation for pure gravity.

11

in fact g1,m(s) can be xed more simply by examining (49). as x  xc, j(x)
diverges and hence gm(s, x) grows faster than exponentially in s, which is impossible,

which is the same condition as (60). we have explored the more indirect route
because this will help in the multi-critical case.

4 the multi-critical models

the multi-critical evolution equation (37) may be written

where, taking a(x) from [16], we have

x1gm(x, t)

r are easy to compute. the function u0(y) is xed by the

xm1 =

1

f (x)

u0(j(x))

and the functions ujk(y) by requiring that (66) is a solution of (64),

xj2k+1 =

1

f (x)

12

ujk(j(x)).

because of the unknown functions gj,m(t), (66) is not of course a complete solution.
note that j(x) is always an even function which diverges as |x|  1
2 and which is
positive for even k and negative for odd k. to determine the critical behaviour
from the properties at large t we need to know the behaviour of the functions u0( )
and ujk( ) for large positive argument. for even k we see by considering (68) and
(69) as |x|  1

2 that

u0( )

ujk( )

2k3 ,

    2k1
    2k1

2k3 .

(70)

however for odd k only the large negative argument behaviour is determined. this
phenomenon always occurs in calculations for the multi-critical models. extrapolat-
ing the solution to positive time leads to a singularity at nite time; it seems to us
quite likely that this is an artefact of the truncation of the original nite dierence
equation (32) into a rst order dierential equation (34) and that the solution may
be stabilised by higher derivative terms. from now on we will concentrate on the
even k models and start by studying the k = 4 case in detail.

4.1 k = 4, even m

as for the k = 2 model we will consider the cases of even and odd m separately.
for even m we have

where the transformed correlation functions are dened as in (47); integrating (73)
we obtain

6,m(s) = 70g2,m(s)  14g4,m(s) + g6,m(s).

(75)

note the appearance of g6,m(s) in (74); this happens because f (x) is singular at
x = 0 which makes the evaluation of the limits of integration slightly non-trivial.
as before it is convenient to deal with

gm(s, y)dy =

(76)

(77)

(78)

in order to full the constraint that gm(s, x) has the correct small x, large s, ex-
pansion. in fact we can immediately determine g6,m(s) as explained at the end of
section 2 by requiring that gm(s, x) does not grow faster than any exponential of s
as x  1

2 which implies that

gm(s,

) = 0

(79)

and so g6,m(s) is related to g2,m(s) and g4,m(s) which still have to be determined.

(of course the ,  and  coecients depend on m but we have suppressed this to
avoid clutter) and substituting into (77) we obtain the o(s0) constraint

c0 = z x

(81)

14

identical manipulations to the k = 2 case show that c0 = 0 ensures ck>0 = 0
also. there are in fact three separate constraints hidden in (81) which are sucient
to determine the k, k and k coecients. to see this we proceed by writing
everything in terms of j. j(x) is an even function with a small x expansion

j(x) =

35
6

x6 +

245

x8 + . . .

so it follows that, by reverting the series,

= (j

ak(j

xk=0

(82)

(83)

where we take the real positive cube root of j (remember that m is even and again
we suppress the m dependence on ak). similarly we have

z x

letting n be an integer, (86) yields three conditions corresponding to terms o(j n ),

now suppose that 0 . . . n 1 and 0 . . . n 1 are known; from (87) we can obtain
0 . . . n 1. then (88) contains only these known coecients together with n which
is thus determined. now (89) determines n . knowing 0 . . . n 1 and 0 . . . n 1
we now determine n from (87). proceeding in this way all the coecients, and thus
the right hand sides of (80), can be obtained iteratively. to analyse the asymptotic
behaviour of the correlation functions we need to know the behaviour of g2,m(s) etc
at small s. resumming the relations (87), (88), and (89), and using the integral

these expressions have the expected properties; they are positive and decreasing
functions of s for small positive s. it follows from (107) that g2,m(t), g4,m(t) and

g6,m(t) all have the same asymptotic behaviour at large t namely

gj,m(t)  t 7

(108)

for j = 2, 4, 6 and hence the exponent  = 12/5. to determine the behaviour of
the higher correlation functions it is simplest to return to (74). all the integrals
yield functions of s which are analytic in some neighbourhood of the origin provided
x < 1/2 and so we can conclude that every coecient of the x expansion of gm(x, t)
behaves the same way and that (108) is valid for all (even) j and m.

for the singular terms in s are simple but the constants appear as innite sums;
fortunately the constants are only needed for the sub-leading s dependence so this
method suces (the reason for this is explained in the next sub-section). the nal
expressions for the correlation functions are very similar to those for even m

odd m, (110), can be merged into the form (119); for any xed m we have k  1
equations for k  1 unknowns.

1. p < k  1; the integrals are divergent as s  0 but the singularities of the

to obtain the integral up to the desired order the second exponential factor
can be taylor expanded and then integrated term by term.

2. p = k  1; after an integration by parts the above construction can be used

and we get

2k3 (cid:18)2k  4

3. p > k  1; the leading non-analytic term is of higher order than we need to

consider so

2(2k  3)kp =

2p  2k + 3

.

(126)

now observe that in all these integrals s always appears with a factor ei2n and
that there are no other phase factors. thus all of the constraint equations (119) can
be obtained from the n = 0 case by making the replacement s  sei2n. they can
thus be written in the form

f0(sei2n) +

(128)

we have truncated the expansion of fp(w) in anticipation of the following. the

now d is clearly non-singular and it is straightforward to check that  is non-
singular. there does not seem to be any simple way of writing the elements of f for
general k but we expect it too is non-singular. then the leading order solution for
g is a constant vector; furthermore the next term in the solution is o(s2/(2k3)).
we have already shown by explicit solution that this is indeed what happens for
k = 4; using maple we have also checked it for k = 6, 8, 10. it follows that

for the correlation functions g

p,m, p = 2, 4, . . . 2(k  1). the relationship (114)
c
p,m and gp,m is non-singular so this conclusion applies also to gp,m, p =
between g
2, 4, . . . 2(k  1). finally we note as usual that the integrals in (113) are analytic
functions of s in the neighbourhood of the origin provided x < 1/2 so the conclusion
extends to all the correlation functions.

approached and to do this consider the modied couplings

so  is related to  in (8) by

1   = exp(  c).

(133)

by denition the multi-critical point is attained as   0. the disk amplitude
a(x) can still be calculated by exploiting the connection with topological gravity
[16]; the topological potential is

v (z) =   kz + z + (1  )(1  z)k

and the disk amplitude

a(, x) = ic

where the contour encircles the branch cut of the logarithm. the branch points are
at z = 0 and

z =

zc
4  1  k1/k

where k is a constant. collapsing the contour onto the cut gives

a(, x) = kz zc/4

integrating we nd that

which reproduces (65) when  = 0.

at small x, even for nite  we still get the leading behaviour

thus the considerations described in detail for k = 4 in section 4 up to equation
(93) go through as before  the only dierence is that all the various coecients

25

are now functions of . however the contours pi are modied; when we make the
change of variable (102)

(141)
the  =  endpoint of the contour occurs at the value of ui where j diverges. the
points where j diverges are of course determined by the zeros of f . dening w
through

 = j (ui)

x2 = zc + k1/kw

where ql is the accumulated nite contribution from all the other poles in (145).
note that the branch cut for the square roots is taken down the negative real axis
so that rewl > 0 for all l. inverting (146) we nd that

w = wl tl exp(cid:0)13/2kslj(cid:1) + 1
tl exp (13/2kslj )  1!2

(147)

where sl and tl are (complex) constants of o(1). it turns out that the quantity

rl/wl is never pure imaginary and thus resl 6= 0; except for the single real root,

sl is not purely real either and hence the correlation functions have some oscillatory
behaviour which is typical of a non-unitary theory. the formula (147) is valid for
j  ; expanding we get

w = wl 1 +

sl = sl,

if resl < 0.

using (142) and (148) we see that the conditions (119) can be written in the form

the apparent singularity in (150) at s = 0 is of course not present provided m (0) is

det m (0) = (k1/k)(k1)(k2)/2yp>q

(wp  wq).

(152)

27

since none of the roots are degenerate m (0) is invertible. therefore the rst non-
analyticity occurs at s  13/2k and hence the mass gap exponent is

(153)

6 discussion

we have found that  = 1  3/2k and  = 2 + 2/(2k  3) and therefore, since
 = 1/k, the fisher scaling relation (13) is indeed satised. the results show that
the functions which are initially undetermined in the peeling calculation do not in
fact change the conclusions one would draw simply by ignoring their contribution
in (66). the value of  agrees with that obtained by slicing [13].

to compare  it is necessary to examine the continuum limit for the perturbation
(132) away from the multi-critical point. the multi-critical models have k inde-
pendent coupling constants so there are k independent directions along which the
multi-critical point can be approached; if chosen appropriately these directions cor-
respond in the continuum limit to operators of (length) dimensions {1, 2, 3, . . . k}
[12]. the procedure for taking the continuum limit is explained in [1]. by denition
boundary loops with l legs in the dual graph (ie which are l links long) have contin-
uum length l = la where a is the length of one link. this implies that the generating
function variable x conjugate to l must be related to a continuum quantity x by
x = xceax where xc is the radius of convergence of the disk amplitude (138). we

(154)

can construct a non-trivial continuum disk amplitude ac(e, x) provided that
 eak
where e is some continuum coupling; we obtain
where a0 is the analytic (non-universal) part of the disk amplitude. note that e

is not the cosmological constant; in the continuum theory the volume v must have
dimension (length)2 and therefore the cosmological constant  must correspond to
whichever direction in the space of lattice couplings leads in the continuum limit to
an operator of dimension 2. it is straightforward to check that this is accomplished
by the modied couplings

a(, x) = a0(, x)  ak1/2ac(e, x) + . . .

the weight for polygons of 2p sides is modied by a p-dependent factor and so the
lattice quantity whose continuum limit is the volume is a complicated object with
polygons of dierent number of sides weighted in dierent ways; the volume is not
the number of polygons.

using the scaling (154) for  in the large t behaviour of the two-point function

we nd that

exp(t) = exp(e(tak)) = exp(et )

and hence we will get a consistent non-trivial scaling limit provided the continuum
string time scales as t  tak. this also agrees with [13] (where what we call the
string time is called the geodesic distance).

(157)

the structure of these multi-critical surfaces seems slightly bizarre. recall that
the coupling  is conjugate to the number of polygons which therefore behaves
roughly like 1 for typical surfaces in the ensemble. on the other hand from (157)
we have that the typical t must be roughly  and therefore

h#polygonsi  hti

1

 .

(158)

when k gets large   1 and so these surfaces have an almost linear structure when
viewed in terms of polygons. however, as we discussed in section 1, the polygons can
be very large so that, for example, the number of links traversed in a typical cycle
can also be very large and it does not follow that the surfaces in the continuum limit
are at all one-dimensional. it does however cast doubt on the idea that it makes
sense to identify the string time t with a continuum geodesic distance.

another manifestation of this can be seen by considering a perturbation in terms
of the cosmological constant . then we expect that the two point function behaves
as

exp(

k

2 t )

(159)

2

(it is a straightforward calculation along the lines of section 5 but using the couplings
(156) to check this). the average volume of the system will be hv i  1; on the
other hand from (159) the string time extent must be of order ts   k
 and
hence hv i  t
. interpreting t as a geodesic distance leads to the conclusion that
the hausdor dimension is dh = 2
k which vanishes as k   and is less than
two for all k > 2. however we can look at this another way; in [13] the probability
distribution for the length l of exit loops at time t given a point-like entrance loop
at t = 0 was calculated. at large but nite k the distribution shows that there

k
s

2

one might worry that the negative weights appearing in the multi-critical models cause some
cancellation which alters this conclusion. we have checked explicitly that for k = 4 at least this
does not happen.

29

k but that as k   the
is typically one macroscopic exit loop of length l  t
distribution function becomes a delta-function. using this result we can relate the
volume to the typical boundary length as k   and nd

1

v  l2

(160)

which is typical of a smooth at surface of hausdor dimension 2. this is the
behaviour we expect because k   corresponds to central charge c  
where semi-classical properties are recovered; the volume and loop length have highly
anomalous behaviour relative to the string time but exactly what we expect relative
to each other. note that our discussion above implies that the macroscopically large
boundary loops are often made from a nite number of polygons with diverging

the multi-critical models are non-unitary and have negative central charge, and
so it is plausible that in the continuum theory the hausdor dimension is given by
(7) which works well for the c = 2 model. as c   (7) gives dh = 2 and so it
is clear that the geodesic distance implicit in the derivation of this formula (which is
done directly in the continuum using scaling arguments and liouville theory) cannot
be equivalent to the continuum limit of the string time, t . since we do not know
what the relationship between these distance measures really is, it is not clear what
calculation in the discretized formulation would be needed to check (7) for general
k; in any case it must be highly non-trivial because (7) gives irrational values for
dh when k > 2 whereas discretized calculations are almost sure to give rational
values for exponents.
