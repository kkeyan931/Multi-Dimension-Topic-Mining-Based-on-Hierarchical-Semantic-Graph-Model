(we chosen signature (+,,,).) better propagator {$9809160$} p;(k) = 2 + k2 + . (5) however, even propagator unacceptable second term, contracts left index right one. prevent contractions, wish use instead propagator, p;(k) = k2 + . (6) sense, graviton h assign index left index right index. course, since h symmetric matter index assigned left right, choice made demand left indices never contract right ones. rst sight gravity propagator (6) might seem rather peculiar since appears violate fundamental property graviton symmetric tensor eld. nevertheless, dicult show one may use propagator (6) instead (5) eect n-graviton s-matrix elements, provided vertices satisfy rigid leftright interchange symmetry. rigid symmetry mean n-point vertex symmetric simultaneous interchange left right lorentz indices, v 12n;12n n (k1, k2, . . . , kn) = v 12n;12n n (k1, k2, . . . , kn) , (7) left indices associated graviton right indices. 4 requirement, one show need symmetrize graviton propagator left right indices. consider, example, diagram g. 2. external legs diagrams need explicitly symmetrized since external graviton polarization tensors automatically symmetrize legs. interchange indices undone performing rigid interchange left right indices left-most vertex. although rigid interchange also ip indices external legs, undone since indices external leg contracted symmetric tensor polarization. type argument works general diagrams. thus, propagator (6) used instead propagator (5) since symmetrization indices automatically taken care rigidly symmetrized vertices symmetric polarization tensors external legs. figure 2: sample diagram showing may use propagator (6) instead (5). given propagator (6) must also choose three vertex. three vertex agrees shell three-graviton vertex suitable purposes. (kinematic restrictions prevent massless particle decaying two others, terms formal polarization tensors vertex vanish; shall also obtain vertex einstein-hilbert action.) string theory (see e.g. ref. ), on-shell three-graviton vertex expressed terms products gauge theory vertices. motivates choice three graviton vertex, ig,, 3 (k, p, q) = gn (k, p, q) v 2(cid:16) 2(cid:17)hv gn (1, 2, 3) = i2(k v 1 + k 2 + k 3 ) , gn (k, p, q) + v gn (p, k, q) v gn (p, k, q)i , (8) (9) color ordered gervais-neveu {$9811140$} yang-mills three vertex, color factor stripped. main reasons using vertex (8) simplicity fact makes relationship gauge theory manifest. construction, vertex symmetric rigid interchange left right indices. armed propagator (6) three vertex (8) may use klt relations nd gravity lagrangian using qcd gluon amplitudes input. rst step process one denes four-vertex subtracting four-point s-matrix obtained via klt relations diagrams containing kinematic pole, shown g. 3. four vertex automatically property left lorentz indices contract right ones, since gravity s-matrix diagrams containing three-point vertex (8) property. moreover, vertex dened way also rigid symmetry interchange left right indices. may convert four-vertex h4 term lagrangian inverting usual procedure obtaining feynman vertices lagrangians. course, ambiguity process since one always add terms vanish shell. long terms mix left right lorentz indices satisfy rigid left-right symmetry, always imposed 5 ( ( figure 3: one obtain four vertex left-right factorization property subtracting diagrams containing kinematic poles s-matrix. hand, acceptable terms; dierences four-vertex induce dierences deduced higher-point vertices. four-graviton terms lagrangian chosen continue pro- cess obtain vertex subtracting ve-graviton amplitude diagrams containing three- four-point vertices. principle, one continue way arbitrary number external legs, allowing one build lagrangian gravity order order perturbation theory using qcd gluon amplitudes. construction lagrangian property generates tree-level s-matrix elements never contracts left indices right ones. starting qcd gluon tree amplitudes, carried construction 1 2 2 h 2h , h,h,hh + h h, h + hh,h,i , points yielding local gravity lagrangian l = pi li, l2 = l3 = h 1 l4 = 2h 1 32 1 4 l5 = 3h 3 h h hh,h 64 + 1 16 1 12 3 h,h,hhh 32 1 h h,h,hh h h hh,h + 6 1 h h,hh,h + 8 1 48 h h h,hh 1 6 h h h,hh + h hh,h, + 1 12 1 6 1 12 1 2 1 12 h h,hh,h h h,hh,h 1 24 h h,hhhi , 1 8 h,hh,h + h h hh, + h h,h,h 1 h h hh,i , 24 h h,h,hh h,h hh,h 1 4 h hh, h, (10) h, = h . minkowski space, one two contracted indices taken raised index using , suppressed this. principle might necessary introduce auxiliary elds locality hold; indeed, discussed below, comparing lagrangian einstein-hilbert gravity lagrangian useful introduce auxiliary dilaton. although lagrangian (10) unique since terms modied adding subtract- ing contributions vanish shell appropriately modifying higher-point contributions, relatively simple one. importantly, shall see below, allows relatively straightforward match conventional einstein-hilbert lagrangian. adjusting four-point terms lagrangian found solution l5 contains six terms, connection einstein-hilbert lagrangian bit complicated. compactness removed rigid symmetrization left right indices; how- 6 ever, one uses propagator (6), vertex must rigidly symmetrized left right indices, e.g., l3 2hh h, h + hh,h, + h h,h,i . (11) although explicitly give generated feynman rules here, quite straightforward obtain these. advantages using feynman rules generated lagrangian instead conventional de donder gauge rule clear: besides fact one use propagator (6) instead complicated de donder gauge propagator (4) three-, four- ve- point vertices quite bit simpler corresponding de donder gauge vertices. interaction terms rigidly symmetrized, deriving feynman rules sense treat h tensor eld special index symmetry. note feynman diagrams generated lagrangian contain explicit factors d. conventional de donder gauge factors appear, somehow cancel s-matrix elements. relative simplicity feynman rules related preservation matrix property left right lorentz indices contract other. although klt relations might appear suggest eld variables exist gravity reformulated polynomial theory four-point interactions gauge theory case, unsuccessful nding lagrangian. lagrangian (10) contain general coordinate invariance although manifest since symmetry gauge xed. make explicit, relate lagrangian (10) usual einstein-hilbert one. order must rst eliminate terms einstein-hilbert lagrangian contract left right graviton indices, i.e, h , h hh , , tr , (12) tr h12 h23 hn1. way types terms tangled einstein-hilbert lagrangian, obvious one accomplish this. nevertheless, existence lagrangian (10) implies must rearrangement desired property. ref. {$9809160$} dilaton introduced allow eld redenition removes graviton trace quadratic terms lagrangian. appearance dilaton auxiliary eld help rearrange lagrangian motivated string theory requires presence eld. following discussion ref. {$9809160$}, consider lagrangian gravity coupled dilaton, leh = 2 2 g r + g .
