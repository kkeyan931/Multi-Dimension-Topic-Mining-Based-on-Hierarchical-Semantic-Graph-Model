it is well known that the discrete nite subgroups of sl(n = 2, 3; c) have been completely classied;
works related to string orbifold theories and quiver theories have of late used these results (see for
example [5, 6, 8, 13] as well as references therein). conjectures regarding higher n have been raised and
works toward nite subgroups of su(4) are under way. recent works by physicists and mathematicians
alike further beckon for a classication of the groups, conveniently presented, in the case of su(4)
[14]. compounded thereupon is the disparity of language under which the groups are discussed: the
classication problem in the past decades has chiey been of interest to either theoretical chemists or to
pure mathematicians, the former of whom disguise them in bravais crystallographic notation (e.g. [15])
while the latter abstract them in elds of nite characteristic (e.g. [16]). subsequently, there is a need
within the string theory community for a list of the nite subgroups of su(4) tabulated in our standard
nomenclature, complete with the generators and some brief but not overly-indulgent digression on their
properties.

the motivations for this need are manifold. there has recently been a host of four dimensional
nite gauge theories constructed by placing d3 branes on orbifold singularities [8]; brane setups have

also been achieved for some of the groups [10]. in particular, a theory with n = 2, 1, 0 supercharges
respectively is obtained from a cn /{  su(n = 2, 3, 4)} singularity with n = 2, 3 (see [5] [8] and
references therein). now as mentioned above n = 2, 3 have been discussed, and n = 4 has yet to be fully
attacked. this last case is of particular interest because it gives rise to an n = 0, non-supersymmetric
theory. on the one hand these orbifold theories provide interesting string backgrounds for checks on
the ads/cft correspondence [9]. on the other hand, toric descriptions for the abelian cases of the
canonical gorenstein singularities have been treated while the non-abelian still remain elusive [11].
moreover, the quiver theories arising from these string orbifold theories (or equivalently, representation

rings of nite subgroups of su(n)) have been hinted to be related to modular invariants of dsu(n)-wzw
models (or equivalently, ane characters of dsu(n)) for arbitrary n [5, 7], and a generalised mckay

correspondence, which would also relate non-linear sigma models, has been suggested to provide a
reason [6]. therefore a need for the discrete subgroups of su(4) arises in all these areas.

indeed the work has been done by blichfeldt [2] in 1917, or at least all the exceptional cases,
though in an obviously outdated parlance and moreover with many innite series being left to the
reader as an exercise. it is therefore the intent of the ensuing monograph to present the discrete
subgroups  of sl(4, c) in a concise fashion, hoping it to be of use to impending work, particularly non-
supersymmetric conformal gauge theories from branes on orbifolds, resolution of gorenstein singularities

in higher dimension, as well as dsu(4)-wzw models.

nomenclature

unless otherwise stated we shall adhere to the convention that  refers to a discrete subgroup of
su(n) (i.e., a nite collineation group), that < x1, .., xn > is a nite group generated by {x1, .., xn},
that h  g means h is a normal subgroup of g, that sn and an are respectively the symmetric and
alternating permutation groups on n elements, and that placing  next to a group signies that it
belongs to su(4)  sl(4; c).

2. preliminary denitions

let  be a nite discrete subgroup of the general linear group, i.e.,   gl(n, c). from a math-
ematical perspective, quotient varieties of the form cn/ may be constructed and by the theorem of
khinich and watanabe [1, 3], the quotient is gorenstein2 if and only if  is in fact in sl(n, c). there-
fore we would like to focus on the discrete subgroups of linear transformations up to linear equivalence,
which are what has been dubbed in the old literature as nite collineation groups [2]. from a physics
perspective, discrete subgroups of su(n)  sl(n; c) have been subject to investigation in the early
2that is, if there exists a nowhere-vanishing holomorphic n-form. these varieties thus provide local models of calabi-

yau manifolds and are recently of great interest.

days of particle phenomenology [4] and have lately been of renewed interest in string theory, especially
in the context of orbifolds (see for example [5, 6, 8, 14]).

there are some standard categorisations of nite collineation groups [2, 3]. they rst fall under the

division of transitivity and intransitivity as follows:

definition 2.1 if the n variables upon which  acts as a linear transformation can be separated into
2 or more sets either directly or after a change of variables, such that the variables of each set are
transformed into linear functions only of themselves, then  is called intransitive; it is called transitive
otherwise.

the transitive  can be further divided into the primitive and imprimitive cases:

definition 2.2 if for the transitive  the variables may be separated3 into 2 or more sets such that
the variables of each are transformed into linear functions of only those in any set according to the
separation (either the same or dierent), then  is called imprimitive; it is called primitive otherwise.

therefore in the matrix representation of the groups, we may navely construe intransitivity as
being block-diagonalisable and imprimitivity as being block o-diagonalisable, whereby making primitive
groups generically having no a priori zero entries. we give examples of an intransitive, a (transitive)
imprimitive and a (transitive) primitive group, in their matrix forms, as follows:

primitive



transitive

let us diagrammatically summarise all these inter-relations as is done in [3]:



intransitive



transitive



imprimitive

primitive



simple
having normal primitive subgroups
having normal intransitive subgroups
having normal imprimitive subgroups

in some sense the primitive groups are the fundamental building blocks and pose as the most dicult
to be classied. it is those primitive groups that blichfeldt presented, as linear transformations, in [2].
these groups are what we might call exceptionals in the sense that they do not fall into innite series,

3again, either directly or after a change of variables.

in analogy to the e6,7,8 groups of su(2). we present them as well as their sub-classications rst.
thereafter we shall list the imprimitive and intransitives, which give rise to a host of innite series of
groups, in analogy to the an and dn of su(2).

let us take a nal digression to clarify the so-called jordan notation, which is the symbol 
commonly used in nite group theory. a linear group  often has its order denoted as || = g for
positive integers g and ; the  signies the order of the subgroup of homotheties, or those multiples
of the identity which together form the center of the sl(n; c). we know that su(n)  sl(n; c), so a
subgroup of the latter is not necessarily that of the former. in the case of sl(n = 2, 3; c), the situation
is simple4: the nite subgroups belonged either to (a) su(n = 2, 3), or to (b) the center-modded5
su(n = 2, 3)/zz2,3, or (c) to both. of course a group with order g in type (b) would have a natural
lifting to type (a) and become a group of order g multiplied by |zz2| = 2 or |zz3 = 3| respectively, which
is now a nite subgroup of the full su(2) or su(3), implying that the jordan  is 2 or 3 respectively.

for the case at hand, the situation is slightly more complicated since 4 is not a prime. therefore 

can be either 2 or 4 depending how one lifts with respect to the relation su(4)/zz2zz2 = so(6) and we

lose a good discriminant of whether or not  is in the full su(4). to this end we have explicitly veried
the unitarity condition for the group elements and will place a star () next to those following groups
which indeed are in the full su(4). moreover, from the viewpoint of string orbifold theories which study
for example the fermionic and bosonic matter content of the resulting yang-mills theory, one naturally
takes interest in spin(6), or the full zz2  zz2 cover of so(6) which admits spinor representations; for
these we shall look in particular at the groups that have  = 4 in the jordan notation, as will be
indicated in the tables below.

3. the discrete finite subgroups of sl(4; c)

we shall henceforth let  denote a nite subgroup of sl(4; c) unless otherwise stated.

3.1 primitive subgroups

7 ,
there are in all 30 types of primitive cases for . first we dene the constants w = e
p =  + 2 + 4, q = 3 + 5 + 6, s = 2 + 5, t = 3 + 4, and u =  + 6. furthermore we shall
adhere to some standard notation and denote the permutation and the alternating permutation group
on n elements respectively as sn and an. moreover, in what follows we shall use the function lif t
to mean the lifting by (perhaps a subgroup) of the abelian center c according to the exact sequence
0  c  su(4)  su(4)/c  0.
4see [4, 5] for a discussion on this point.
5for n = 2, this our familiar su (2)/zz2 = so(3).

3.2 intransitive subgroups

these cases are what could be constructed from the various combinations of the discrete subgroups
of sl(2; c) and sl(3; c) according to the various possibilities of diagonal embeddings. namely, they
consist of those of the form (1, 1, 1, 1) which represents the various possible abelian groups with one-
dimensional (cyclotomic) representation6, (1, 1, 2), two abelians and an sl(2; c) subgroup, (1, 3), an
abelian and an sl(3; c) subgroup, and (2, 2), two sl(2; c) subgroups as well as the various permuta-
tions thereupon. since these embedded groups (as collineation groups of lower dimension) have been
well discussed [5], we shall not delve too far into their account.

3.3 imprimitive groups

the analogues of the dihedral groups (in both sl(2; c) and sl(3; c)), which present themselves as
innite series, are to be found in these last cases of . they are of two subtypes:

 (a) generated by the canonical abelian group of order n3 for n  zz+ whose elements are

as well as respectively the four groups a4, s4, the sylow-8 subgroup sy  s4 (or the ordinary
dihedral group of 8 elements) and zz2  zz2;

h, zz2  zz2i

hh, t i

we have presented, in modern notation, the classication of the discrete subgroups of sl(4, c) and in
particular, of su(4). the matrix generators and orders of these groups have been tabulated, while bear-
ing in mind how the latter fall into sub-categories of transitivity and primitivity standard to discussions
on collineation groups.

furthermore, we have computed the character table for the 30 exceptional cases [18]; the interested
reader may, at his or her convenience, nd the character tables at http://pierre.mit.edu/yhe/su4.ct.
these tables will be crucial to quiver theories. as an example, we present in figure 1 the quiver for the
irreducible 4 of the group (i) of order 60  4, which is the lift of the alternating permutation group on
5 elements.

indeed such quiver diagrams may be constructed for all the groups using the character tables
mentioned above. we note in passing that since   su(4) gives rise to an n = 0 theory in 4
dimensions, supersymmetry will not come to our aid in relating the fermionic a4
ij and the bosonic a6
ij
as was done in [5]. however we can analyse the problem with a slight modication and place a stack of
m2 branes on the orbifold, (which in the maldacena picture corresponds to orbifolds on the s7 factor
in ads4  s7), and obtain an n = 2 theory in 3 dimensions at least in the ir limit as we lift from type
iia to m theory [8, 11, 12]. this supersymmetry would help us to impose the constraining relation
between the two matter matrices, and hence the two quiver diagrams. this would be an interesting
check which we leave to future work.

we see therefore a host of prospective research in various areas, particularly in the context of string
orbifold/gauge theories, wzw modular invariants, and singularity-resolutions in algebraic geometry. it
is hoped that this monograph, together with its companion tables on the web, will provide a ready-
reference to works in these directions.
