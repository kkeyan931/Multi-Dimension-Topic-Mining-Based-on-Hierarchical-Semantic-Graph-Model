we show that in a two-dimensional -model whose elds only depend on one target

space co-ordinate, the o(d, d) invariance of the conformal invariance conditions observed

at one loop is preserved at two loops (in the general case with torsion) and at three loops

(in the case without torsion).

1. introduction

duality invariance has proved to be an immensely fruitful concept in string theory.

a particular aspect of duality which has been valuable in string cosmology (for a recent

comprehensive review of this subject, with an extensive list of references, see ref. [1]) is

the concept of o(d, d) invariance. this is displayed in the case where the elds depend

only on time in an arbitrary number of dimensions (time and d spatial dimensions). it was

discovered some time ago[2] that the lowest order string eective action (in the simplest

case with only the metric, dilaton and antisymmetric tensor eld) then exhibits continuous,

global o(d, d) invariance. (this is also reminiscent of the o(d, d) invariance previously

observed in the context of string compactications[3].) the o(d, d) invariance of the string

action was later found to persist in the presence of matter or gauge elds[4]. now the

conformal invariance conditions for the elds are related to the eld equations of the string

action, and so, at least at lowest order, the o(d, d) invariance can be used to transform

between dierent conformal backgrounds. duality invariance in general can be understood

as a consequence of an isometry in an underlying theory[5]; and the o(d, d) invariance can

be viewed as the result of gauging d abelian isometries[6]. in refs. [2] and [7] it was argued

that the o(d, d) invariance should be maintained to all orders. in ref. [8] the two-loop

string action was considered in the context of elds depending only on time, and it was

shown that after a suitable eld redenition it could be written in an explicitly o(d, d)

invariant form. however, it was pointed out in ref. [9] (in the context of t duality) that

the invariance of the action does not manifestly guarantee that the conformal invariance

conditions transform appropriately. therefore it seems to us that it is necessary to check

explicitly the transformation properties of the conformal invariance conditions in order to

complete the proof that o(d, d) invariance is preserved. at one loop this has been done

in ref. [2]. the main purpose of this paper is to verify the invariance at two loops (with

torsion) and at three loops (without torsion). we shall nd various subtleties which do

not arise in checking the invariance of the action.

2. the one-loop case

the two-dimensional non-linear -model is dened by the action

s = 1

2 z d2xng xx + b xx + r(2)o ,

(2.1)

2

where g is the metric, b is the antisymmetric tensor eld and  is the dilaton. 
is the metric on the two-dimensional worldsheet,  = det ,  is the two-dimensional
alternating symbol and r(2) is the worldsheet ricci scalar. conformal invariance for the
-model requires the vanishing of the three functions g, b and , which are dened
by[10]

 + 2  + 2(s),
 + h 
 s,

g
 =g
b
  + h 
 =b
 = + ()2 + s.

(2.2)

here g, b and  are the renormalisation group -functions for the -model, and h is
the eld strength for b , dened by h = 3[b]. the vector s arises in the process
of dening the trace of the energy-momentum tensor as a nite composite operator, and

can be computed perturbatively. at one loop we have

(2.3)

h 2,

where h 2 = hh , and s = 0. the conformal invariance conditions can be derived
at this order from the string eective action

162(1) = z dxd+1ge2(cid:8)r  1

12 h 2 + 4()2(cid:9) .

to be more precise, we have

g = g(1)

b =  b(1)

(1)
=4 (1),


where

 .

(2.4)

(2.5)

(2.6)

to consider o(d, d) duality, we specialise to a metric with signature (, +, +, . . . , +) and
we consider a -model where the elds depend only on the rst co-ordinate t. we can then

bring g and b to the block-diagonal form

g = (cid:18) g00

0 g(t)(cid:19) ,

0

3

b = (cid:18) 0

0 b(t)(cid:19) .

0

(2.7)

(for the discussion of o(d, d) invariance at one loop, one can take g00 = 1; but at higher
loops we need to consider a general g00 at intermediate stages, returning to g00 = 1 at
the end of the computation. in fact, we shall only retain a general g00 at points where it
will leave an imprint even after setting g00 = 1for instance, where it is acted upon by a

.) it was shown in ref. [2] that the one-loop action may then be written as



g00

162(1) = z dteg

and

m = (cid:18) g1

bg1 g  bg1b(cid:19) .

g1b

the o(d, d) group is represented by matrices  such that

t = ;

the action in eq. (2.8) is invariant under the action of the o(d, d) group with

m  m  = t m ,

  ,

g00  g00.

(2.8)

(2.9)

(2.10)

(2.11)

(2.12)

(2.13)

the matrix m has two important properties; m is symmetric m  o(d, d).

as we mentioned earlier, the invariance of the action does not manifestly guarantee

that the conformal invariance conditions transform appropriately. in the o(d, d) case, even

at one loop, where the conformal invariance conditions are simply related to the action
by eq. (2.5), it does not seem immediately obvious how the correct properties for the 
follow from the invariance of the action; and at higher loops, where the relation of the
-functions to the action is more complicated, it is still less clear. therefore in this paper
we shall explicitly check the transformation properties of the -functions.

as in the case of the action, the -functions are most conveniently discussed in terms

of the matrix m . dening m =  d

d m , we have from eq. (2.11)

m = (cid:18) g1gg1

(b  g1g)g1 g  bg1b + bg1gg1b  bg1g(cid:19) .

g1(gg1b  b)

(2.14)

we then dene

m =m  1

2 (  + s) m
=(cid:18) g1 gg1
( b  g1 g)g1

g  bg1b + bg1 gg1b  bg1 g(cid:19) ,

g1( gg1b  b)

(2.15)

where we assume (as will always be the case in the present calculation) that si = 0 and
s0  s.

we start with the one-loop -functions. as mentioned before, these have already
been demonstrated to have the correct properties, but we shall repeat the check in order to

demonstrate our formalism in operation. upon specialising the general results in eqs. (2.2),
(2.3) to the forms for g and b given in eq. (2.7), we nd that the -functions for g
and b are given at one loop by

162 g(1) = 1

162 b(1) = 1

2 (g00)g(x  w 2  w 2  w  1
2 (g00)g( x  w w  w w   w  1

2 g00 g00w ),

2 g00 g00 w ),

(2.16)

where

w = g1 g,

w = g1 b,

x = g1 g,

x = g1 b.

(2.17)

as mentioned earlier, to demonstrate the invariance at two and three loops. we need to
retain a general g00 for the moment, though we shall set g00 = 1 at the end of the
calculation. substituting eq. (2.16) in eq. (2.15), we nd that we can write

162 m (1) = 1

2 ( m + m  m m   m ).

(2.18)

(expressions for m and m are given in the appendix.) the o(d, d) invariance for g
ij and
ij is then manifest, for clearly when m and  transform according to eq. (2.13), m (1)
b
transforms according to

m  m (m ) = t m (m ).

(2.19)

now if eq. (2.19) is satised, then since from eqs. (2.13), (2.15), we also have m 
(m ) =
t m (m ), we deduce that m (m ) = m 
(m ), i.e. m is form-invariant under the
o(d, d) transformation. a solution of the conformal invariance conditions with m (m ) =
0 automatically satises m 
the

(m ) = 0; but now we also have m (m ) = 0, i.e.

transformed m  is a solution of the same conformal invariance conditions as m . eq. (2.19)

will be our touchstone for o(d, d) invariance at two and three loops as well.

(2.20)

(2.21)

we note here that the trace of an even number of products of m  and its derivatives is

manifestly invariant under eq. (2.13) while the trace of an odd number of such products
is zero, and therefore g(1)

and (1) are o(d, d)-invariant.

00

3. the two-loop case

in this section we shall show that eq. (2.19) continues to hold, and that g(1)

and
(1) are o(d, d)-invariant, at two loops. at this order, however, we nd that to make the
invariance manifest we need to make eld redenitions, as has already been found in the

00

case of the two-loop action in ref. [8].

the o(d, d) invariance is not immediately manifest at two loops; for instance, g(2)
and
(2) cannot be written in terms of the traces of products of an even number of m  and
its derivatives. however, we may take advantage of the possibility of redening the elds

(br)ij = bij + bij

(gr)00 = g00 + g00,

r = + , sr = s + s,

(3.8)

with mr, mr and mr dened as in eqs. (2.11), (2.14) and (2.15), but with g replaced
by gr, etc. note that here again we have included a general g00. the idea that duality
invariance might require corrections at higher orders was put forward in ref. [12], and

an early example in the current context for a particular string background was given in

7

ref. [13]. the two-loop corrections required for t -duality of the general string eective

action were obtained in ref. [14], and the invariance of the -functions was discussed in

the torsion-free case in ref. [9].

combining eqs. (3.4)(3.7) with eqs. (3.11)(3.14), substituting in eq. (2.15), and

using the results in the appendix, we now nd that we have up to this order

the o(d, d) invariance is now manifest; as at one loop, when mr and  transform according
to eq. (2.13), mr transforms according to eq. (2.19), and (gr )

and r are invariant.

00

the calculation of ref. [8] uses the action corresponding to a scheme with  =  = 0;

this action was singled out in ref. [15] as being the unique ghost-free two-loop string

eective action in the presence of torsion, and in the present context appears to lead to

the most economical demonstration of invariance, although its use is not mandatory. in this

scheme, although there is no need to redene g00, it is certainly still necessary to include
a general g00 at intermediate stages of the calculation for the -functions (due to the
term in eqs. (3.9)), whereas the invariance of the action can be shown with g00 = 1
throughout. this is a conrmation that the invariance of the -functions is not simply

g00



9

a consequence of the invariance of the action. note that the parts of the redenitions in

eq. (3.10) involving  and  are essentially undoing those in eq. (3.3). nevertheless, it is a

valuable exercise to perform the calculation for general  and  because it gives a foretaste

of the kinds of eld redenition we shall be obliged to use in the three-loop case.

4. the three-loop case

in this section, we shall show the o(d, d) invariance of the -functions for elds only
depending on t at three loops in the absence of torsion. at three loops, the -functions

for a general theory are given by[16]

once again, the o(d, d)-invariance is far from manifest, and we are obliged to resort to

eld redenitions. using redenitions as in eqs. (a.11)(a.14), we nd variations of the
-functions as in eqs. (a.15)(a.18). taking the particular values of the coecients as

given in eq. (a.19), we nd, on combining eqs. (a.15)(a.18) with

eqs. (4.4)(4.6), and substituting in eq. (2.15), that we can write

in these equations mr is dened by eq. (2.11), but with b = 0. once again, the o(d, d)
invariance is now manifest; when m and  transform according to eq. (2.13), mr trans-
forms according to eq. (2.19), and (gr )
00 and r are invariant. we have tried to choose the
eld redenitions in order to minimise the number of terms which appear hereclearly with

only partial success. however, we should stress that it is very non-trivial and apparently

miraculous that an o(d, d)-invariant form could be found at all, since there are many more

constraints than there are free parameters.

5. conclusions

in this paper we have shown explicitly that the conformal invariance conditions are

form-invariant under o(d, d) transformations up to two loops for the general case with

torsion. in principle, it should be possible to compare our results with the two-loop results

of ref. [13] which were established for a specic background. we have also demonstrated

the o(d, d) invariance up to three loops in the torsion-free case. we should mention,

however, that we expect at three loops that in the presence of torsion, assuming that
o(d, d) invariance is still preserved, the various -functions will still adopt the form of

eqs. (4.7)(4.9), but with mr now including b as in eq. (2.11). the three-loop -function

in the presence of torsion has been calculated[18], but evidently the inclusion of torsion

in the present computation would be prohibitively complex. finally, it is interesting that

we found it essential, rst of all to keep g00 as a variable in the calculation, and secondly
to consider variations of g00at two loops in the  6= 0 case, and also at three loops.
it is not clear whether this necessity is envisaged in the argument for all-orders o(d, d)
invariance presented in ref. [7], where the gauge g00 = 1 was chosen from the outset.
presumably one could in fact demonstrate o(d, d)-invariance with a general g00, without
setting g00 = 1 at the end, though this would be somewhat tedious.

next, here are the identities we used to write m in terms of m at two loops:

m =(cid:18)
m =(cid:18)

where

w p  w

w g1

g( w  p w )g1 g(w + p w p  w p  p w )(cid:19) ,
g(p a + bt )g1 g(x  bt p + p b + p ap )(cid:19) ,
b = 2w w  x.

ap + b

a = 2w 2  x,
tr[ m  m ] =tr[w 2  w 2]

p = g1b,

tr[ m  m  m  m ] =tr[w 4 + w 4  4w 2 w 2 + 2w w w w ].
