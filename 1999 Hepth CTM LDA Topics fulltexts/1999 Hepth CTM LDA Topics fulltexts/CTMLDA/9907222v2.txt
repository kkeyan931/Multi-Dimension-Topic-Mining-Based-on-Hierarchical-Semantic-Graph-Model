it is shown that the static axially symmetric solutions of su(2) einstein-yang-mills-dilaton
theory constructed by kleihaus and kunz are gauge-equivalent to two-parameter families of non-
abelian gravitating magnetic dipoles, characterized by mass and magnetic dipole moment. the
existence of other particle-like solutions is unlikely.

i. introduction

since the pioneering papers by bogomolnyi [1] and witten [2] on exact solutions of classical yang-mills theory
many studies in this eld have been carried out.
in recent time the gravitational self-interaction of solitons has
been of interest [3]. not only spherically symmetric solutions of theories including yang-mills elds, with or without
gravitation, higgs, or dilaton elds, have been constructed, but also solutions with axial symmetry [4]. these latter
type of solutions was studied by kleihaus and kunz in the context of yang-mills-dilaton theory [5] and einstein-
yang-mills-dilaton theory [69], mainly by numerical construction. the relevance of solutions containing black holes
is that they provide counterexamples to the no-hair conjecture for such theories. this conjecture is the analog to the
no-hair theorems in einstein-maxwell and related theories [10].

in a recent discussion [11] we pointed out that the gauge eld part of the solutions described in refs. [59] are
not regular on the symmetry axis, in contradiction to what was claimed, but kleihaus [12] showed that non-regular
gauge transformations exist that bring the solutions locally into a regular form, meant twice dierentiable [13]. now
it appears that the solutions rather become similar to monopole solutions than to particle-like solutions and thus have
to be interpreted accordingly [1416].

in this article we intend to clarify the situation regarding the nature and existence of particle-type solutions of
theories involving su(2)-yang-mills elds, but not any higgs elds. we explicitly derive the conditions for the
regularity, and compare with the recent study by kleihaus [12] that relates the non-regular solutions to regular ones
via a (non-regular) gauge transformations. we show that these gauge transformation can even be extended to global
ones, thus yielding indeed globally regular particle-like solutions with the desired boundary conditions. it is shown
that possibly three types of solutions exist, because the gauge eld part contains only two free constants. an analysis
of the asymptotic properties yields clear indication that only the non-abelian solutions with a dominant magnetic
dipole in the asymptotic behaviour extend to full solutions of the non-linear equations. thus there exist only near-
abelian particle-like solutions, and the solutions constructed by kleihaus and kunz are shown to be gauge-equivalent
to these.

ii. regularity

non-regular gauge elds are encountered within diracs theory of monopoles. in general, solutions of maxwells
equations for the electromagnetic four-potential must be twice continuous dierentiable in order to be acceptable
from the mathematical point of view. from the aharonov-bohm eect we know that continuity of
the potential
is essential. for the derivation of the eld equations from an action one uses partial integration, thus the solutions
must be dierentiable. in general, regularity means that all solutions are at least twice dierentiable in the sense of
distributions, allowing for delta-like sources. vacuum solutions will in general be locally analytic. in diracs theory
of monopoles there exists no globally dened regular gauge eld, only the electromagnetic eld tensor is regular. one
can nd a gauge transformation in the vicinity of the singularity on the symmetry axis that gives a locally regular
gauge eld, and the compatibility condition in the overlap region leads to the quantization of the monopole [14,15].
in the case of non-abelian gauge theories the situation is more complicated, and for overlapping solutions connected
by gauge transformations compatibility conditions are required [16]. another problem of the nonlinear theory is that
the gauge potentials explicitly enter in the eld equations for the gauge eld tensor, because in contrast to the abelian
case the gauge eld tensor is only gauge covariant, not invariant. thus, at singular points of the gauge potential the
eld equations are not well dened, even if the eld tensor is. in the case of spherically symmetric solutions there
will in general be only a singularity at the origin, because a possible coordinate singularity on the z-axis plays no role

1

due to the spherical symmetry. witten [2] explicitly showed how such a singularity can be removed from classical
solutions by a gauge transformation.

in the case of axially symmetric solutions the situation becomes more complicated, since a coordinate singularity
at  = 0,  is introduced, but cannot be removed by a symmetry argument. together with axial symmetry rebbi and
rossi [4] introduced a winding number n into their ansatz for the gauge eld, using unit vectors in the lie algebra
su(2) of su (2) that correspond to cylindrical coordinates (, , z). writing these as

u1 =  n
u2 =  n
u3 =  n

 = 1 cos n + 2 sin n
 = 1 sin n + 2 cos n
z = 3

where i, i = 1, 2, 3 are the pauli matrices, the gauge eld attains the form

a = uiw i


(1)

(2)

with twelve independent gauge elds w i
su(2) will be

, i = 1, 2, 3,  = 0, 1, 2, 3. in spherical coordinates (r, , ) the unit vector of

 n
r = 1 sin  cos n + 2 sin  sin n + 3 cos ,
 n
 = 1 cos  cos n + 2 cos  sin n  3 sin ,
 n
 = 1 sin n + 2 cos n

(3)

the gauge potentials a are not regular unless the functions w i
 behave appropriately on the z-axis, since the functions
sin n, cos n, when considered as functions on s2, are neither continuous nor dierentiable at the poles  = 0, .
the functions sin n and cos n can be expanded into polynomials of degree |n| in the variables sin  = y/ and
cos  = x/, with  = px2 + y2; all terms of these polynomials have denominators that are even powers of  for n
even, and odd powers of  for n odd. hence |n| sin n and |n| cos n are regular functions except at r = 0, and may
further be multiplied by functions of the variables 2 and z without loosing their regularity. this was explicitly taken
into account by rebbi and rossi [4]. in spherical coordinates functions of the type

f (cid:0)r, 2(cid:1) sin|n|  sin n + g(cid:0)r, 2(cid:1) sin|n|  cos n

(4)

with regular functions f and g are regular along the axis  = 0, possibly except at r = 0. the well dened -parity of
these functions is easily understood. on any great circle through the pole at  = 0, with  = 0 to the right of the
pole,  = 0   to the left, and coordinate

we have for any function f () (dened only for  > 0)

 = (cid:26)

 for  > 0,  = 0

 for  < 0,  = 0  

lim
0

k
k f ( = ) sin n (0  )
k
k f ( = ) sin n0.

= (1)n+k lim

0

(5)

(6)

therefore it is necessary that f () is an even function in  for n even, an odd function for n odd in order that
f () sin n can be continuous (k = 0) or that the derivatives exist (k = 1, 2, ...). together with the multiplication
by the factor sin|n|  we obtain (4) as a sucient form for functions to be analytical at  = 0. if analyticity is not
required, restrictions on the higher orders of the series expansion of f () are required only up that order to which
dierentiability is sought.

kleihaus and kunz use spherical coordinates (r, , ). their ansatz for the su (2) gauge eld is [8]:

adx =

1

2gr (cid:26)  n

 [h1dr + (1  h2)rd]
n [ n

 (1  h4)] r sin d (cid:27)

r h3 +  n

(7)

this gauge potential is singular at x = y = 0 unless appropriate conditions are imposed on the functions hi,
i = 1, 2, 3, 4 that depend only on r and . in order to analyze this ansatz for regularity, we decompose the gauge
potential into its cartesian components,

aidxi =

xj=1

with the nine functions wj

i given by

 j (cid:16)wj

1dx + wj

2dy + wj

3dz(cid:17) ,

w1
1 = f1 sin n cos  + nf3 cos n sin 
w2
1 = f1 cos n cos  + nf3 sin n sin 
w3
1 = nf4 sin 
w1
2 = f1 sin n sin   nf3 cos n cos 
w2
2 = f1 cos n sin   nf3 sin n cos 
w3
2 = nf4 cos 
w1
3 = f2 sin n
w2
3 = f2 cos n
w3
3 = 0.

f1 = h1 sin  + (1  h2) cos 
f2 = h1 cos   (1  h2) sin 
f3 = h3 sin  + (1  h4) cos 
f4 = h3 cos   (1  h4) sin .

the functions f1 to f4 are dened by

we see that a sucient condition that the gauge potential can be continuously extended to  = 0 for r > 0 is

f1 (r, ) = f1 (r, ) sin|n|+1 
f2 (r, ) = f2 (r, ) sin|n| 
f3 (r, ) = f3 (r, ) sin|n|+1 
f4 (r, ) = f4 (r, ) sin 

(8)

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

with continuous functions f1 to f4.
if regularity is further sought up to a certain number of derivatives, then
accordingly more constraints on the odd orders in  are needed. the solutions are analytical if f1 to f4 depend only
on 2. now a more subtle point is that these conditions guarantee regularity, but are not necessary. in the special
case n = 1 with spherical symmetry and h1 = h3 = 0, h2 = h4 = w(r) we see that f1 and f3 do not respect (11)
and (13), respectively. the reason is that in the case f1 = f3 the relation cos2  + sin2  = 1 leads to a regular
function where in general f1 cos2  + f3 sin2  would not have been regular. it is not dicult to see that for arbitrary
n this will happen if

so that we can do with two powers less of sin  in (11) and (13) if the functions agree in the lowest order. hence a
global ansatz that is regular and also respects all symmetry requirements at  = 0, , and /2 is given by

f1 = nf3

(15)

f1 (r, ) = hnf (r) + f1 (r, sin ) sin2 i cos  sin|n|1 
f2 (r, ) = f2 (r, sin ) sin|n| 
f3 (r, ) = hf (r) + f3 (r, sin ) sin2 i cos  sin|n|1 
f4 (r, ) = f4 (r, sin ) sin 

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

for the function hi this implies

h1 = f1 sin  + f2 cos 

= hnf (r) + f1 sin2  + f2i cos  sin|n| 

(1  h2) = f1 cos   f2 sin 

3

h3 = f3 sin  + f4 cos 

= h(cid:16)nf (r) + f1 sin2 (cid:17) cos2   f2 sin2 i sin|n|1 
= h(cid:16)f (r) + f3 sin2 (cid:17) sin|n|1  + f4i sin  cos 
= hf (r) + f3 sin2 i cos2  sin|n|1   f4 sin2 .

(1  h4) = f3 cos   f4 sin 

(20)

this especially implies that h1 and 1  h2 will always have a well dened reection symmetry at  = 0, whereas for
h3 and 1  h4 this is not necessarily the case only for odd n. for particle-like solutions it is required that h1 and
h3 are antisymmetric, h2 and h4 symmetric around /2, because this is the only type of symmetry the non-linear
equations admit. the solutions constructed by kleihaus and kunz [59] explicitly do not have the regular form (20),
but kleihaus most recently showed [12] that for n = 2, 3, 4 a gauge transformation of the form

u (~r) = exp(i


2

 n
 )

leads to a new gauge eld

a = u au  + idu u 

=

that satises the following conditions:

(21)

(22)

(23)

this transformation results evidently in a continuous gauge potential [20], and further conditions on the next to
leading orders are also satised [13], resulting in potentials that are twice dierentiable at least.

under gauge transformation (22) with gauge function  as given in (21) the functions hi transform as

iii. gauge transformations

h1  h1 = h1  rr
h2  h2 = h2 + 
h3  h3 = cos (h3 + cot )  sin h4  cot 
h4  h4 = sin (h3 + cot ) + cos h4.

(24)

kleihaus [12] explicitly constructed gauge functions (n)
(o) (r, ) such that the new functions hi lead to
gauge potentials ai that are regular along the positive z-axis and the origin, respectively. the negative z-axis is dealt
with by a symmetry argument. these gauge functions are not dened globally, so that the question arises whether
this method leads to regular global gauge elds. the answer is positive. the functions (n)
(z) (r, ) are odd functions in
, given in the form

(z) (r, ) and (n)

(n)
(z) (r, ) =

k(n)

xk=1

g(k)(r)2k1

4

(25)

where k(n) = 2 for n = 2, 3 and k(n) = 3 for n = 4. we obviously can replace each 2k1 by some odd polynomial
pk(sin ) with

such that the modied gauge function

pk(sin ) = 2k1 + o(2k(n)+1)

(n)
(z) (r, ) =

k(n)

xk=1

g(k)(r)pk(sin )

(26)

(27)

has the same eect on the regularity of the functions hi as the original one. we further can achieve the desired
antisymmetry around  = /2 by multiplying the gauge function by

q () = cos 

1 +

k(n)

xj=1

aj sin2j 

 = 1 + o(2k(n)+1)

where aj are the coecients of the series expansion of (cid:0)1  x2(cid:1)1/2

k(n)

around x = 0. the resulting gauge function

(n)
(z) (r, ) = q ()

xk=1

g(k)(r)pk(sin )

(28)

(29)

then is globally dened, and leads to globally dened functions hi possessing the desired regularity everywhere as
well as symmetry properties. noting further that the gauge employed by kleihaus and kunz,

rrh1 = h2

(30)

can be reached from any regular gauge potential without eecting the regularity or symmetry, is becomes clear that
the solutions constructed correspond to globally regular or black hole solutions of su(2)-einstein-yang-mills-dilaton
theory. but what remains to be claried is the physical nature of the solutions, what classes of solutions exist that
are not equivalent under gauge transformations. some of the criterions employed by kleihaus and kunz, as the node
number and the sign of the function h4 on the symmetry axis are gauge-dependent, moreover the gauge condition
(30) still allows locally for residual gauge transformations generated by gauge functions  that satisfy [7]

this equation that is satised by all functions

 = rk (a sin k + b cos k)

h(rr)2 + 2

i  = 0.

(31)

(32)

with constants a, b and integer k. because this leaves us with gauge degrees of freedom in the asymptotic equations,
this gauge is not ideally suited to analyze the existence of solutions. therefore we now work with the dierent gauge

because then no residual gauge transformations exist that respect the regularity conditions. in view of (24) this gauge
is easily reached by choosing

h2 = 1,

(33)

 (r, ) = z 

0

(h2 (r, )  1) d,

(34)

but we have to make a judicious choice of the lower boundary 0 of this integral, because not all boundary and
symmetry requirement of the function hi can be preserved. if h2 is symmetric around  = /2 and h1 antisymmetric,
then h1 will be antisymmetric only if  = /2. but this choice eects the regularity of h1, h3 and h4. only for
0 = 0 the behavior (23) will be preserved along the positive z-axis, while singularities may appear at the negative
z-axis, for 0 =  the regularity conditions will be satised only along the negative z-axis, while singularities may
appear at the positive z-axis. choosing 0 = 0 we insist on the regularity condition (23), and must take singularities

5

along the negative z-axis into account in our considerations. also, the function h1 will no longer be antisymmetric if
h1 was, since we have

h1 = h1  rr = h1 +z 

/2

rrh2 (r, ) d +z /2

0

rrh2 (r, ) d

so that h1 consists of an antisymmetric function h1 plus some function h of r alone:

h1 (r, ) = h1 (r, ) + h (r)
h1 (r, ) = h1 +z 

/2

rrh2 (r, ) d

(35)

(36)

h (r) = z /2

0

rrh2 (r, ) d

the important point for our argument on existence in the next section is, that starting from globally regular or black
hole solutions that satisfy the boundary and symmetry conditions imposed by kleihaus and kunz, we obtain via the
gauge condition (33) unique functions hi that satisfy the regularity conditions (23) along the positive z-axis and the
new symmetry condition (36).

iv. existence of static axially symmetric solutions

it is well known that classical su(2) yang-mills theory neither admits spherically symmetric particle-like solutions
nor monopole-like solutions [17]. when the gauge eld is coupled to a higgs eld monopoles exist, the t hooft-
polyakov monopoles [18], when coupled to gravity particle-like solutions exist, found by bartnik and mckinnon [19].
the theories with and without higgs eld dier in a decisive way. a higgs eld that behaves as  1/r at large radii
leads to a source term in the yang-mills eld equations in the leading order r3 of an expansion into powers of r1,
whereas the gravitational and dilaton elds act in a dierent way. the gauge eld equations of einstein-yang-mills-
dilaton theory have the form

where

1

g

d(cid:16)gg

g 

e2f (cid:17) = 0

f = a  a + ie [a, a]

is the eld strength tensor depending on the gauge eld

a =

 aaa
,

(37)

(38)

(39)

d is the gauge covariant derivative, g is the space-time metric,  the dilaton eld. the ansatz for the metric is [8]

ds2 = g (r, ) dt2 +

m (r, )
g (r, )

dr2 +

m (r, )
g (r, )

r2d2 +

l (r, )
g (r, )

r2 sin2 d2.

(40)

the full yang-mills equations possess a remarkable feature. when we use the ansatz (20) for the functions hi (with
f (r) = 0 [20]) and expand the functions fi as well as the other functions involved into power series with respect to
sin ,

fi (r, sin ) =



xk=0

fik (r) sink  for i = 1, 3, 4

f2 (r, sin ) = cos2  f1 (r, sin )



u(r, ) = 1 +

(r, ) =



xk=0

uk (r) sink  for u = g, m, l

xk=1
k (r) sink ,

6

(41)

insert this into the su(2)-yang-mills equations (37) and solve these equations order by order in sink  we see that
we are left with precisely two free functions in the solution, which are f10(r) and f40(r). all other functions fik (r)
are then completely determined through these function and the functions uk and k, where the latter have to be
determined from the einstein and dilaton equations, respectively. for n = 2 we explicitly obtain [20]:

specifying f10(r) means that the nth derivative with respect to  of h1 at  = 0 is one of the boundary condition
that need be given in order to specify the solution uniquely. because only two boundary conditions can be given once
the regularity conditions (16-19) are imposed, we must expect diculties when we try to reach additional boundary
conditions for the other functions at  = 0 or at  = /2. we must avoid that the problem is overdetermined,
moreover the singular coecients of the equations will normally lead to problems in numerical procedures. thus it is
more suitable to specify one set of boundary conditions at  = 0, the other  = /2.

because we have two degrees of freedom, namely the functions f10 and f40 , there exist possibly three types of
solutions: type i with f10 6= 0 and f40 = 0, type ii with f10 = 0 and f40 6= 0, and type iii with f10 6= 0 and f40 6= 0.

a. asymptotic behavior of solutions

there is no true source term for the gauge eld, so that as long as the metric is still asymptotically at with
deviations proportional to 1/r, and the dilaton eld behaves as   0 + 1/r at innity, these elds couple only into
the next to leading order of the yang-mills eld equations. thus, as long as solutions can be expanded into powers
of r1, as assumed in [8,9], the leading order of the gauge eld necessarily is a solution of the free eld equations
in leading order. this circumstance allows us to exclude the existence of certain solutions with help of the free eld
equations alone. the method is straightforward. we use (20) together with (41) and expand in powers of r1:

fik (r) =

n

xl=l0

fiklrl for i = 1, 3, 4

and

0 = d(cid:16)gg

g 

e2f i

 (cid:17) = rlo (cid:0)ei(cid:1) + o(rl01).

(43)

(44)

the resulting twelve equations ei = 0 in leading order reduce, as in the full case, to four independent equations
when no gauge condition is given, and when we employ the gauge (33) one of these four equations is redundant. the
resulting three independent equations do not depend on the metric or dilaton function provided we assume that at
spacial innity

thus, for each given n  2 and l0  0 we arrive at a set of three coupled equations for the coecients fikl0 , i =
1, 3, 4; k = 0, 1, 2....only for l0 = 0 these equations are nonlinear, for l0 > 0 we obtain linear equations.

uk  1 + o(cid:0)r1(cid:1) ,   0 + o(cid:0)r1(cid:1) .

(45)

7

1. type i

1 always increases monotonically. moreover, the radius of convergence is 1 and f 0
1 cos  = f 0

in this case the asymptotic behavior is characterized by the single constant f10l0 . we solved the three coupled
dierential equations in  by comparing order by order an expansion with respect to the variable x = sin  [21]. the
results are the following. in the nonlinear case l0 = 0 the function h(r) in (36) vanishes because h2 is independent
of r in leading order. thus h1 should satisfy h1( = /2) = 0. technically, we proceeded in the following way.
we specied the only independent boundary value c = f100 and computed the power series expansions f 0
i (x) =
pn
k=0 fik0xk up to order n = 100. it turned out that all coecients f1k0 have the same sign independent of c, so that
the function f 0
1 evidently develops
1 1  x2 and found
a singularity at x = 1( = /2). therefore we looked at the series expansion of f 0
that the taylor series of this function still has coecients with the same sign for all k. thus the leading order in
r1 of the function h1 is monotonous, increasing for c < 0, decreasing for c > 0, and can never reach the boundary
condition h1( = /2) = 0. when the equations for l0 = 0 are linearized an equation for h1 alone is obtained , which
can easily be solved. we nd the exact solutions h1 = tan2 (/2) as the one regular at  = 0, the second solution is
tan2 ((  ) /2), with a singularity at  = 0. this situation is quite similar to that of dirac monopole solutions, but
we can exclude the existence of particle-like solutions of type i with l0 = 0.
in the linear case l0 > 0 we have to go one step further in the analysis. because the function h(r) in (36) need
h1( = /2) = 0, if h1 is
not vanish, we now consider the second derivative with respect to , we should have 2

antisymmetric and twice dierentiable. our result is the following. for for l0 = 1 and all n (we checked from n = 2 to
n = 4), not only the function h1, but also the partial derivatives  h1 and 2
h1

even diverges at  = /2. we must make sure that this divergence is not introduced by our gauge transformation.
we have

h1 are monotonous functions, and 2


h1 is nite if h1 and h2 are twice dierentiable.

2


h1 = 2

 h1 + rrh2 (r, ) ,

(46)

therefore 2


for l0 = 2 this divergence no longer is present, we even nd a nite solution, which can for n = 2 even be written

in a closed form, found by kleihaus and kunz [22]:

f 2

1 (x) =

1  x2  1
x21  x2

, f 2

3 (x) =

2(cid:0)1  1  x2(cid:1)  x21  x2

4x41  x2

, f 2

4 (x) = 0,

that corresponds to

h1 =

(47)

(48)

c
r2 (cos   1) ,
c
4r2 (cid:2)2 (1  cos )  sin2  cos (cid:3) ,

c

4r2 (cid:2)2 (1  cos )  sin2  cos (cid:3) cot .

h3 =
h4 = 1 

here it can explicitly be seen that the symmetry at  = /2 is of the form (36) with a constant symmetric part of h1.
for all higher l0  3 we also nd regular solutions of the linearized equations that satisfy the regularity conditions
(16-19), but no longer possess the symmetry behavior (36) because the second derivative of h1 with respect to  no
longer vanishes, as can be concluded from the power series expansion. the existence of full solutions now depend on
the solubility of the inhomogeneous equations in higher orders of 1/r. here one faces the problem that neither the
solutions of according homogeneous nor of the full inhomogeneous equations in general will be of the form (36) for h1,
and the one free constant one has is not enough to satify all regularity and boundary conditions. thus we conclude
that it is unlikely that solutions with h1 antisymmetric around  = /2 exist. the question whether monopole- or
particle-like solutions exist at all seems rather dicult to answer

we now consider the case f10 = 0 and f40 6= 0. as indicated already by (42), we observe that when we set f10(r) = 0

then f1k(r) = f3k(r) = 0 for all k, and we are left with a solution of the type

that is embedded abelian and does not possess any nontrivial winding number.

let again l0 be the smallest integer with f40l0 6= 0. the analysis of the asymptotic behavior now is simplied by
the fact that the solutions we look for are known, the equations are identical to the magnetic maxwell equations.
thus, for l0 = 0 there exist the dirac monopole solutions,
for l0 = 1 we have a magnetic dipole, for l0 > 1 the
corresponding multipoles. for particle-like solutions the magnetic charge must be zero, the leading behavior that of
a magnetic dipole or higher multipole. but then we are confronted with the black hole uniqueness theorem [?] that
states that for an uncharged non-rotating black hole the schwarzschild solution is the unique static solution of the
einstein-maxwell equations. thus type ii solutions of particle type do not exist. this means that when we try to
solve the equations order by order in powers of r1 then the boundary condition at  = /2 cannot be met, similar
as for type i.

3. type iii

here the question is whether compared to type i the additional nonzero f40 will change the situation. this is
obviously the case, because the solutions constructed by kleihaus and kunz [59] must fall this category, possessing a
dominant magnetic dipole behaviour at innity. the expansion at spatial innity is given in appendix c of reference
[8]. it contains two constants, h12 that enters into the terms of order r2 [23] of all functions and h31 that appears
in order r1 of the functions h3 and h4. the constant h12 clearly can be removed by a gauge of the type 32 with

 = 

1
2r2 sin 2.

(50)

the constant h31 corresponds to f4 = h31/r sin  in (20)or l0 = 1, f40(r) = h31r1, see (41). a nonzero f10 now
h1 at
must be generated in the higher, non-asymptotic powers of r1, because otherwise the boundary condition for 2

 = /2 cannot be met. this implies that the function f10 is determined order by order in r1 by this requirement. it
is not immediately clear, whether the constant c in (48) will be nonzero. but, because (i) we have only two constants
from solutions of the homogeneous equations, (ii) with one constant the boundary conditions cannot be met, and (iii)
the solutions of the homogeneous equations do not possess the correct symmetry in higher orders, we conclude that
there exists no further free parameter in the solutions than possibly this constant c. thus the solutions constructed
by kleihaus and kunz describe gravitating non-abelian magnetic dipoles with or without coupling to a dilaton eld.
in each case the classes of gauge-equivalent solutions are characterized by two parameters: the total mass, reected
by the asymptotic behavior of the metric function g, and the magnetic dipole moment, given by the asymptotic
behavior of the function f4. the weaker non-abelian part possibly admit a third parameter. the node number of the
gauge functions on the symmetry axis, as well as the sign of the functions h2 and h4 at innity, cannot be used for
classication, because they exist only in non-regular gauges.

v. conclusions

we analyzed the existence of

static axially symmetric solutions of su(2) yang-mills equations coupled to grav-
itational or dilaton elds. two parameters characterized the classes of gauge-equivalent solutions: the total mass
and a magnetic dipole moment dominate the asymptotic behaviour at spatial innity, the solutions are uncharged.
we found that apart from these solutions constructed numerically by kleihaus and kunz particle-like solutions are
unlikely to exist, though we cannot fully exclude the existence of one further parameter characterizing the asymptotic
non-abelian part. a non-abelian admixture to the abelian-dominated solutions leads to the existence of solutions
which do not have a counterpart in the einstein-maxwell system.
