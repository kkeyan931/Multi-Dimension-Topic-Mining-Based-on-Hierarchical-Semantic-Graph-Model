abstract

it is shown from a simple scaling invariance that the ultra-relativistic hamil-

tonian (=0) does not have bound states when the potential is coulombic.

this supplements the application of the relativistic virial theorem derived

by lucha and schoberl [1,2] which shows that bound states do not exist for

potentials more singular than the coulomb potential.

the relativistic generalization of the schrodinger equation (rse)

qp2 + 2(x) + v (r)(x) = (e + )(x)

(1)

has been used in describing quark-antiquark bound states when one of the constituents is

light and the other heavy [3]. the mass  can be considered as the constituent mass of the

light quark and e is the binding energy.

this hamiltonian has two interesting critical behaviors concerning the existence of bound

states when the potential is coulombic,

vc = /r,

 > 0.

(2)

first, it has been shown that, irrespective of the value of , when the coupling constant of

the coulomb potential  approaches the value 2/ from below, the bound states disappear

due to the large singularity of the potential at the origin [4]. this means, as a corollary, that

there are no bound states when the potential is more singular than coulomb. in this letter,

i show the second critical behavior concerning the existence of bound states for a coulombic

potential:

irrespective of the value of coupling constant, bound states do not exist for a

massless particle ( = 0). this second critical behavior in terms of  implies (similar to the

what is implied by the rst critical behavior in terms of ) that there are no bound states

with massless particles for a potential more singular than coulomb.

first i derive a scaling feature of rse for a general potential. then i concentrate on

the coulomb potential and show that bound states do not exist for massless particles when

the potential is coulombic. i start with two wavefunctions (x) and (x) and their fourier

transforms (p) and (p) related in the following way,

if the potential is coulomb v (x) = /r, then we arrive at the scaling results that if

in fact this theorem applies to slightly more general potentials. as long as the parameters

of the potential v (x) are all dimensionless, then

1
t

v (

x
t

) = v (x).

(12)

this is the only criteria that the potential must satisfy. in particular, the potential need

not be spherically symmetric. for example potentials like

v (x) =  1x2+y2  2

|z|

(cylindrical)

(13)

3

and

v (x) = 

ax2+by2+cz2

(ellipsoidal)

(14)

do satisfy eq.(12). the underlying reason for this generality is that if the potential has only

dimensionless parameters, the wavefunction is restricted to the form

(x) = 

3

2 f (x;{i}).

then after normalization, eq.(9) reduces to the statement

if (x) = 

3

2 f (x;{i})

then

(x) = 

3

2 f (x;{i}).

(15)

(16)

here the normalization is r dx3|f (x;{i})|2 = 1.

in fact, from a dimensional point of view alone, one can show that eq.(15) must hold for

non-relativistic schrodinger equation (nrse), and from this, all the relations (9),(10) and

(11) as well.

this scaling behavior indicates, in words, that as the mass increases by a factor of t, the

wavefunction shrinks by a factor of t and the binding energy is also increased by a factor

of t (in magnitude). from this, it is clear that for  = 0,  = 0 automatically as well.

this means now the hamiltonians (7) and (8) become identical. since this is true for any
arbitrary t, it follows e   as t  0. hence there are no massless bound states.

one can also extract simple scaling laws for other types of potentials from eq.(6). in
particular, for massless case with a potential v (r) = rk with k > 1, one can again show
that bound states do not exist by taking the limit t  0. this time the potential is not
invariant but

v (

r
t

) = tkv (r).

(17)

therefore, as t  0 the potential becomes shallower, nevertheless, still the wavefunction
shrinks to zero width and the energy goes to negative innity. thus again there are no

bound states. this is reminiscent to the well-known theorem in nrse which states that

4

for a potential more singular than r2 bound states do not exist [5]. here in our situation,

since massless bound states do not exist for a coulomb potential it is intuitively clear that

for a potential more singular, the same is true.

this fact that the bound states do not exist for a potential more singular than the

coulomb potential can be inferred also from the relativistic virial theorem (rvt) derived

by lucha and schoberl [1,2]. it states, for an eigenstate of two-body relativistic hamiltonian

(in the center-of-mass frame)

h = qp2 + m2

1 +qp2 + m2

2 + v (x),

the gradient of the potential is related to the kinetic energy as

hx  v (x)i = h

p2

qp2 + m2

1

+

p2

qp2 + m2

2

i.

this leads to

(18)

(19)

(20)

i

 = hx  v (x)i + hv (x)i + h

qp2 + m2

1

qp2 + m2

2

m2

m2

where  denotes the total energy of the two-body system of particle mass m1 and m2. the

hamiltonian (18) simplies to (1) when m2 is taken to innity and m1 is set to be .

accordingly (20) also reduces to

e = hx  v (x)i + hv (x)i + h

2

p2 + 2i.

(21)

here the lhs has been reduced to the binding energy e. for a radially symmetric power law

potential

v (r) = rk

where  is positive for k > 0 and negative for k < 0, this means simply

e = (k + 1)hv i + h

2

p2 + 2i.

(22)

(23)

clearly for k < 1, if bound states were to exist, it would give a nonsensical result because
the lhs is negative while rhs is positive. this indicates that the eigenstates themselves do

5

not exist for those potentials with k < 1 for both nite and zero . literally taken, rvt
predicts that all the massless particle bound states have one and the same binding energy

e = 0 for a coulomb potential (k = 1). this could also be seen as a manifestation that
the bound states do not exist and the expectation values can not be dened.

incidentally, in the non-relativistic case, not only these scaling relations eqs.(9), (10),

(11) and (17) hold, but more general scaling relations can be derived. indeed, nrse with a

potential of the form v (r) = rk, where  is positive when k > 0, and negative when k < 0,

can be converted in radially reduced form to the following dimensionless equation [6],

d2
d2 w() + [sgn()k +



l(l + 1)

2

]w() = w().

(24)

from this, it can be seen that all the scaling relations derived here are only a part of this more

general scaling transformation. unfortunately, for the rse case, this general transformation

to the dimensionless form, which would allow one to extract a lot more informations on the

bound states, does not seem to be possible.
