abstract

extending previous work on a(1)
2 , we present a set of reection matrices, which are explicit
solutions to the a(1)
n boundary yang-baxter equation. unlike solutions found previously
these are multiplet-changing k-matrices, and could therefore be used as soliton reection
matrices for ane toda eld theories on the half-line.

1 introduction

in the study of two-dimensional integrable models on the whole line an important role is being played
by the yang-baxter-equation (ybe), which arises from the factorisability of the s-matrix. the ybe
has been studied for a long time and a large number of solutions, the so-called r-matrices, are known.
the boundary yang-baxter equation (bybe) is the analogue of the ybe in two-dimensional models
on a half-line, i.e. models with one reecting boundary. factorisability and integrability on a half-line
imply a highly non-trivial relation between r-matrices and reection matrices, which are the so-called
k-matrices. much less work has been done on the bybe and only a small number of solutions for some
specic cases have been found so far. (for more details on the bybe and its connection to integrable
models on a half-line see [1], [2] and references therein.)

here we are interested in bybes related to trigonometric r-matrices. these are intertwining maps

of the form

ra,b(x) : va  vb  vb  va ,

in which x is a spectral parameter and the v s are the representation spaces of the fundamental
representations of some quantized universal enveloping algebra uq(g) of an ane lie algebra g. these
r-matrices satisfy the ybe in the form

rb,c(x)  ia . ib  ra,c(xy) . ra,b(y)  ic = ic  ra,b(y) . ra,c(xy)  ib . ia  rb,c(x) ,

in which ia denotes the identity on va, such that both sides of the equation map va  vb  vc into
vc  vb  va. (note that the indices a, b, c denote the type of representation.)

here we are only considering the case of g = a(1)

n , for which two dierent types of the bybe
exist. these two types are distinguished by whether the k-matrices map a representation space va
into itself or into the conjugate space vn+1a. these two cases could be related to integrable models
in which the particles either remain in the same multiplet or transform into a particle in the charge
conjugate multiplet after reection from the boundary. the non-multiplet changing bybe for the
lowest r-matrices can be written in the following form:
x
y

i1  k(y) . r1,1(xy) . i1  k(x) . r1,1(

x
y

) = r1,1(

) . i1  k(x) . r1,1(xy) . i1  k(y) ,

(1.1)

in which the reection matrices are maps

k(x) : v1  v1 .

diagonal solutions to equation (1.1) were found some years ago in [3] and they have been used in
connection with spin chains (see for instance [4]).

however, more recently it has been discovered that in order to describe the reection of solitons in
imaginary coupled a(1)
n ane toda eld theory a dierent type of k-matrices is needed. in [2] it was
realised that ane toda solitons reect into antisolitons, which are the states in the charge conjugate
multiplet. this property has also been conrmed in a semiclassical study of ane toda theories on a
half-line in [5]. therefore, we require k-matrices of the general form

k(x) : v1  vn ,

(1.2)

1

which now have to be solutions to the following multiplet changing bybe:

in  k(y) . r1,n(xy) . i1  k(x) . r1,1(

x
y

) = rn,n(

x
y

) . in  k(x) . r1,n(xy) . i1  k(y) .

(1.3)

solutions to this equation for the case of g = a(1)
case of g = a(1)

n are the subject of this letter.

2 were rst found in [2] and the solutions for the general

2 the a(1)

n r-matrix

in order to solve the bybe (1.3) we rst need an explicit expression of the r-matrix corresponding to
the rst fundamental representation of uq(a(1)
n ). these r-matrices were originally given by jimbo in
[6]. we use a slightly modied notation here2:

n

r1,1(x) = (xhq4  xhq4)

eii  eii + (xh  xh)xi6=j
xi=1
+(q4  q4)
x(i,j) eii  ejj +xi>j
xi<j

x(i,j) eii  ejj
 ,

eij  eji

(2.1)

in which the ei,j are n  n matrices with the only entry being a 1 in the ith row and jth column.
i,j . for the sake of convenience
i,j (x). all the non-zero elements

alternatively, we can write this r-matrix as a n2  n2-matrix (cid:2) r1,1(x)(cid:3)k,l
we omit the multiplet labelling from now on and write(cid:2) r1,1(x)(cid:3)k,l

of this matrix are then given by

 rk,l

i,j

ri,i
i,i(x) = xhq4  xhq4 ,
rj,i
i,j(x) = xh  xh ,
ri,j
i,j(x) = (q4  q4)x(i,j) ,

(for i, j = 1, ..., n and i 6= j)

(2.2)

in which h = n + 1 is the coxeter number of a(1)
n , and (i, j) is determined by the gradation of the
r-matrices. (for more details about r-matrices and their gradations see for instance [7], [8].) for the
two gradations we are interested in, (i, j) is given as follows:

homogeneous gradation:

principal gradation:

h

(i, j) = (cid:26) h
(i, j) = (cid:26) 2(i  j) + h

2(i  j)  h

(i < j)
(i > j)

(i < j)
(i > j)

,

.

(2.3)

(2.4)

2comparing this expression with those in [6], we have changed x  x2h and k  q4. note also that this is the

intertwining r-matrix which is related to jimbos r-matrix by r = p r, in which p is the permutation matrix.

2

an important aspect of these r-matrices is the fact that they are crossing symmetric, and one can
therefore choose the bases of the representation spaces such that the crossed r-matrices are given as

ri,k
j,l
rj,i
l,k
rl,j
k,i

(x) = rk,l

i,j (q2x1) ,

(x) = rk,l

i,j (x) ,

(x) = rk,l

i,j (q2x1) .

(2.5)

here we have used a short hand notation in which barred indices denote the labels in vn and unbarred
indices those in v1, which means for instance

rk,l
i,j

(x) (cid:2) r1,n(x)(cid:3)k,l

i,j

: v1  vn  vn  v1 .

3 the k-matrices

since the dimension of the spaces v1 and vn are both equal to n, we can write the k-matrices as n  n
matrices k j
i (x). using this explicit matrix form we can rewrite the bybe (1.3) into the following
form:

k k

j (y) rl,m

(xy) k n

m(x) rp,r

i,k

) = rk,l
i,j (

) k m

l (x) rp,n

k,m(xy) k r

(3.1)

in which summation over repeated indices is implied.

in analogy to the a(1)

case there is one very simple solution, which is a diagonal matrix

1 (x) =

it is straightforward to show that this is indeed a solution to equation (3.1). in fact, it is not even
necessary to know the exact form of the r-matrix elements, because the diagonal matrix k (d)
solves
the bybe corresponding to any r-matrix which satises the crossing relations (2.5). if this k-matrix
was used as a reection matrix it would mean that the states in the rst multiplet are reected into
their charge conjugate partners in the nth multiplet. in a recent paper [9] this solution was used as a
starting point in the construction of the reection factors for a(1)

n ane toda eld theory.

however, the main result of this letter is the fact that we have also found two explicit nondiagonal
solutions to equation (3.1), for both the homogeneous and the principal gradation. these two solutions
are only distinguished by some signs and can be written in the following form:

if

i = j ,

sign(j  i)(cid:16) x

q(cid:17)(i,j)

if

i 6= j .

(3.3)

(3.4)

for the case of n = 2 these solutions are the same as those found in [2]. unfortunately, we do not
know any elegant way to prove that these expression do satisfy the bybe, but they have been checked
in detail using algebraic software. some details of this check are provided in the appendix.

in both solutions (3.3) and (3.4) there still remains a n-fold freedom, namely these k-matrices
remain solutions to the same bybe, if we multiply them from the left and from the right by a diagonal
matrix

(3.5)

in which ei = ei(q) can be arbitrary functions of the deformation parameter q (but not of x). in other
words, the bybe appears to be invariant under transformations of the form

k j

i (x)  ei(q) ej (q) k j

i (x) .

(3.6)

if these k-matrices are to be used as reection matrices for an integrable model, then the parameters
ei could be related to dierent integrable boundary conditions. however, as it was shown in [2], the
additional conditions imposed on the reection matrices by boundary unitarity and boundary crossing,
can restrict signicantly the possible number of free boundary parameters.

in addition, the k-matrices are only determined up to an overall scalar factor a(x). in order to
use these solutions as reection matrices for the reection of solitons in a(1)
n ane toda eld theories,
it would be necessary to nd explicit expressions for the overall scalar factor, which is determined by
the boundary-unitarity and boundary bootstrap conditions.

finally, note that we have only provided solutions related to the rst fundamental representation
of uq(a(1)
n ). in general, there are of course n possible sets of k-matrices k (a) : va  vn+1a (for
a = 1, . . . , n). these higher k-matrices can in principle be constructed from the solutions (3.3) and
(3.4) by using the bootstrap equations. this, however, goes beyond the scope of this letter. however,

4

we do hope that the explicit solutions found here will shed some light on the general structure of
k-matrices and may help in the construction of k-matrices for other algebras.

a a sketch of proof

it would be desirable to have a proof in terms of quantum algebra properties, but all we can do at
this stage is to check the above solutions using some algebraic software such as maplev. fortunately,
however, due to the particular form of the a(1)
n r-matrices this check can be performed for general n,
rather than just for some particular example. the details of this proof itself are not very illuminating
and we therefore just mention the main idea.

in general, in order to prove equation (3.1), we would have to check n4 dierent equations. however,
because of the fact that most of the entries in the r-matrix (2.2) are equal to zero, this number can
be decreased substantially and we can perform the check for general i, j, k, l = 1, . . . , n. we will
demonstrate this for one example in detail.

consider equation (3.1) for the case i = j and p 6= r, and also i 6= p and i 6= r. let us rst examine
the last term on the left hand side of (3.1). because of the fact that p 6= r there are only two possible
non-zero terms, namely rp,r

y ). thus, the left hand side of the equation reduces to

analogously, considering the right hand side of (3.1), we see that the rst term is the r-matrix

which proves the bybe for this particular case. we saw that we did not need to know the explicit
values of i , p, r or n. it was sucient to know which indices dier from each other. it is therefore
fairly straightforward to implement this in form of an algorithm and check every case for general n.
here we have used maplev to check that (3.3) and (3.4) both solve (3.1) for the homogeneous as well
as the principal gradation. this procedure does not lend itself to nding new solutions easily, but it is
straightforward to check whether a given ansatz is a solution.
