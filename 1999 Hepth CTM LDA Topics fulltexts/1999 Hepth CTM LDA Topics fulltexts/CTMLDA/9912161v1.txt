abstract. in these lectures we present a detailed description of the origin
and of the construction of the boundary state that is now widely used for
studying the properties of d branes.

1. introduction

the existence of dp-branes in string theories has been an essential ingredi-
ent for concluding that the ve consistent and perturbatively inequivalent
supersymmetric string theories in ten dimensions belong to a unique eleven
dimensional theory that is called m-theory. in the framework of string the-
ories their existence was required by t-duality in theories with both open
and closed strings 1. on the other hand classical solutions of the low-energy

string eective action coupled to graviton, dilaton and (p + 1)-form r-r
potential were later constructed 2. since their tension is proportional to
the inverse of the string coupling constant they correspond to new non-
perturbative states of string theory. at the end of 1995 polchinski [3] pro-
vided strong arguments for identifying this new states with the dp-branes
required by t-duality opening the way to study their properties in string
theory. in particular their interaction can be computed through the one-
loop open string annulus diagram. on the other hand, since the very early
days of string theory it is known that this one-loop open string diagram
can be equivalently rewritten as a tree diagram in the closed string theory
in which a closed string is generated from the vacuum, propagates for a
while and then annihilates again in the vacuum. the state that describes
the creation of closed string from the vacuum is called the boundary state,
that rst appeared in the literature [4] in the early days of string theory
for factorizing the planar and non-planar loops of open string in the closed
string channel. in the middle of the eighties after that the brst invari-
ant formulation of string theory became available the boundary states was
considered again in a series of beautiful papers by callan et al. [5], where,
among other things, the ghost contribution was added and the boundary
state with an external abelian gauge eld was constructed. it was also used
for deriving the gauge group of open string theories by requiring the tadpole
cancellation [6]. its extension to the case of dirichlet boundary conditions
was given in a series of beautiful papers written by m.green et al. [7]
for studying dp-branes before it became clear that they were new states
of string theory corresponding to the classical solution of the low-energy
string eective action. in the last few years the boundary state has been
widely used for studying properties of d branes in string theory.

in these lectures after a review of the main properties of perturba-
tive string theory we discuss in detail t-duality for both open and closed
string theories and we show how the requirement of t-duality in presence
of open strings implies the existence of dp-branes that are then identied
with the new non-perturbative states obtained as classical solutions of the
low-energy string eective action. then, by requiring that the interaction
between two dp-branes gives the same result if we compute it in the open or
in the closed string channel, we construct the boundary state that provides
a stringy description of the simplest dp brane solutions. finally we show
how to connect the boundary state to the supergravity classical solutions.

2. perturbative string theory

the action of the bosonic string theory is

s = 

t

2 zm

d2h hx x ,

3

(2.1)

where t is the string tension, m is the world-sheet of the string described
by the world sheet coordinate   (, ), h is the world sheet metric
tensor and h = deth. the string tension is related to the regge slope by
t = (2)1.

the action in eq.(2.1) is invariant under local reparametrizations of
the world sheet coordinates corresponding to   f () and under local
weyl transformations corresponding to a local rescaling of the metric tensor
h  ()h . these symmetries allow one to bring the metric tensor in
the form h = e. this choice is referred to as the conformal gauge
choice.

in this gauge the string action is still invariant under some residual local
symmetries. it is in fact invariant under a combination of a weyl rescaling
and a local reparametrization    +  (f  = 1 + ) satisfying the
following condition
(2.2)

 +  = () ,

which corresponds to an innitesimal conformal transformation. string the-
ory in the conformal gauge is then conformal invariant.

the equation of motion for the string coordinate x  following from the

action in eq.(2.1) in the conformal gauge is given by

(2
  2

 )x  = 0

,

 = 0, ..., d  1,

(2.3)

while that for the metric implies the vanishing of the world sheet energy-
momentum tensor

(2.4)

where d is the number of dimensions of the embedding space-time. by vary-
ing the action in eq.(2.1) in the conformal gauge, in addition to the previous
eqs. of motion, we must also impose the following boundary conditions:

z d(cid:18)x  x|= 

1
2

x  x|=0(cid:19) = 0,

(2.5)

where we have taken   [0, ]
leading to two dierent theories. by imposing the periodicity condition

the previous boundary conditions can be satised in two dierent ways

x (, 0) = x (, ),

(2.6)

4

paolo di vecchia and antonella liccardo

we obtain a closed string theory, while requiring
xx |0, = 0,

(2.7)

separately at both  = 0 and  =  we obtain an open string theory. in
this latter case eq.(2.7) can be satised in either of the two ways

(cid:26) x|0, = 0  neumann boundary conditions
x |0, = 0  dirichlet boundary conditions.

(2.8)

if the open string satises neumann boundary conditions at both its end-
points (n-n boundary conditions) the general solution of the eqs.(2.3) and
(2.5) is equal to

n
n

where n is an integer. in order to have more compact expressions without
any distinction between the zero and non-zero modes it is convenient to
introduce 

ein cos n(cid:19) ,

x (, ) = q + 2p + i2xn6=0(cid:18) 
0 = 2p. for d-d boundary conditions we have
ein sin n(cid:19) .

c(  ) + d

x (, ) =

finally for mixed boundary conditions we have

r

eir cos r(cid:19) ,

for n-d boundary conditions. c and d are two constant vectors describing
the position of the two endpoints of the string in the embedding space-
time. among the four solutions in eqs. (2.9)-(2.12) the only one which is
poincare invariant is the one correponding to n-n boundary conditions. in
the following, unless explicitly mentioned, we will refer to this case.

passing to the case of a closed string the most general solution of the
eqs. of motion and of the periodicity condition in eq.(2.6) can be written
as follows

x (, ) = q + 2p + is

also here it is convenient to introduce the notation 

the world sheet energy-momentum tensor given in eq.(2.4) is conserved
if the string eqs. of motion are satised and is also traceless as a consequence
of the invariance under weyl rescaling. it is useful to rewrite it in the light
cone coordinates

0 = pq

0 = e

+ =  + 

;

(2.14)

where its two independent components are

t++ = +x  +x

;

t = x  x.

(2.15)

they are both vanishing as a consequence of the eq. of motion for the metric
in eq.(2.4).

inserting in the previous eqs. the mode expansion for a closed string we

get

t++  xnzelne2in( +)
where ln and eln are given by
m  n+m

ln =

2 xmz

;

t  xnz

lne2in( ) ,

(2.16)

eln =

1

2 xmzem en+m.

(2.17)

and 0 and 0 are dened after eq.(2.13) in terms of the momentum. in
the case of an open string we have only one set of virasoro generators:

ln =

1

2 xmz

m  n+m .

(2.18)

where 0 is dened after eq.(2.9) in terms of the momentum. the theory
can be quantized by imposing equal time canonical commutation relations

[ x (,  ), x  (,  )] = i(  ) ,

[x (,  ), x  (,  )] = [ x (,  ),

x  (,  )] = 0 ,

(2.19)

(2.20)

which require the following commutation relations on the oscillators and
the zero modes

[

m, 

m,e
n] = [e

[

m,e

n] = mm+n,0

;

[q, p] = i ,

(2.21)

n] = [q, q] = [p, p] = 0 .

(2.22)

6

paolo di vecchia and antonella liccardo

in the quantum theory the virasoro generators given in eqs.(2.17) and
(2.18) are dened by normal ordering the oscillators. but the only operators

the only ones containing products of non-commuting oscillators. we get
therefore:

4

for which this normal ordering matters are l0 and el0, because they are
xn=1en en , (2.23)

el0 =

n  n

xn=1

l0 =

p2 +

p2 +


4

for closed strings, and

;

l0 =  p2 +

xn=1

n  n ,

(2.24)

for open strings. the commutation relations for the ln operators give rise
to the virasoro algebra with central extention

[lm, ln] = (m  n)lm+n +

d
12

m(m2  1)m+n,o ,

(2.25)

the central extension of virasoro algebra is a consequence of the fact that
we have dened l0 with the normal ordering. in the case of a closed string

satisfy the same virasoro algebra as in eq.(2.25).

we also have the operators elm that commute with all lm operators and
in the quantum theory the oscillators n and en become creation and
annihilation operators acting on a fock space. the vacuum state |0i|0ie|pi

with momentum p is dened by the conditions



n|0i|0ie|pi = 

n|0i|0ie|pi = 0 n > 0 ,

p|0i|0ie|pi = p|0i|0ie|pi ,

because of the lorentz metric the fock space dened by the commutation
relations in eqs.(2.21) and (2.22) contains states with negative norm. the
physical states in the closed string case are characterized by the following
conditions:

(2.26)

( lm|physi = elm|physi = 0
(l0  1)|physi = (el0  1)|physi = 0 ,

m > 0

where the intercept 1 appearing in the second equations is a consequence
of the normal ordering of l0 and el0. in the open string we have to impose
only one set of the previous conditions.

from the lowest eqs. in (2.27) and from eqs.(2.23) and (2.24) we can

read the expression for the mass operator. for an open string one gets

where  is a world sheet majorana spinor and the matrices

mations

where  is a constant majorana spinor. the nother current corresponding
to the previous invariance is the supercurrent

(2.36)

as before, also these boundary conditions can be fullled in two dierent
ways. in the case of an open string eqs.(2.37) are satised if we require

(cid:26) (0,  ) = 1+(0,  )

(,  ) = 2+(,  )

,

(2.38)

8

paolo di vecchia and antonella liccardo

where 1 and 2 can take the values 1. in particular if 1 = 2 we get
what is called the ramond (r) sector of the open string, while if 1 = 2
we get the neveu-schwarz (ns) sector. in the case of a closed string the
fermionic coordinates  are independent from each other and they can
be either periodic or anti-periodic. this amounts to impose the following
conditions:


(0,  ) = 3

(,  )


+(0,  ) = 4

+(,  ),

(2.39)

that satisfy the boundary conditions in eq.(2.37). in this case we have four
dierent sectors according to the two values that 3 and 4 take

3 = 4 = 1  (r  r)
3 = 4 = 1  (ns  ns)
3 = 4 = 1  (r  ns)
3 = 4 = 1  (ns  r)

the superstring can be quantized by imposing the canonical commutation
relations in eqs.(2.19) and (2.20) for the bosonic coordinates and the fol-
lowing canonical anticommutation relations for the fermionic ones

also in the supersymmetric case the quantum virasoro generators are de-
ned with a normal ordered product of the oscillators, and again the normal

the (anti)commutation relations for the operators given in eqs. (2.46), for

in the r sector. notice that only the c-number terms in the r.h.s. of the
previous equations are dierent in the two sectors. the algebra of the ra-
mond sector can be brought into the same form as the one in the ns sector
by a redenition of l0  l0 + d/16. this observation will be used later
on to determine the dimension of the spin eld operator in the ramond
sector.

also in superstring the spectrum contains unphysical states with nega-

tive norm. the conditions which select the physical states are

the ns or in r sector. in the closed string case we should also add the level
matching condition

(l0 el0  a0 + a0)|physi = 0.

(2.62)

3. conformal field theory formulation

as mentioned in sect. 2, string theories in the conformal gauge are two-
dimensional conformal eld theories. thus, instead of the operatorial analy-
sis that we have discussed until now, one can give an equivalent description
by using the language of conformal eld theory in which one works with the
ope rather then commutators or anticommutators and that contributes to
simplify many calculations. in the case of a closed string it is convenient to
introduce the variables z and z that are related to the world sheet variables
 and  through a conformal transformation:

z = e2i( )

;

z = e2i( +) ,

(3.63)

in the case of an euclidean world sheet (  i ) z and z are complex con-
jugate of each other. in terms of them we can write the bosonic coordinate
x  as follows:

1

(3.64)

x (z, z) =

2hx (z) + ex (z)i
0 + i2xn6=0
0 + i2xn6=0 e

x (z) = q  i2 log z
ex (z) = q  i2 log ze
0 = p/2 p. in the case of an open string theory one can

introduce the variables:

0 = e

and the string coordinate can be written as

x (z, z) =

2

[x (z) + x (z)]

,

(3.68)

paolo di vecchia and antonella liccardo

12
where x  is given in eq. (3.65) and 2 p = 
0 . in superstring theory
we must also introduce a conformal eld with conformal dimension equal
to 1/2 corresponding to the fermionic coordinate. in the closed string case
we have two independent elds for the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic
sectors which are obtained from eqs. (2.42) and (2.43) through the wick
rotation   i and the conformal transformation (, )  (z, z)

(z) xt

tzt1/2

;

e(z) xt et zt1/2

(3.69)

in the open string case, starting from eq.(2.41) and applying the same
operations we get again eqs.(3.69), but this time with the same oscillators.
in what follows we will explicitly consider only the holomorphic sector
for the closed string. analogous considerations hold for the antiholomorphic
sector. in the case of an open string it is sucient to consider the string
coordinate at the string endpoint  = 0. in both cases it is convenient to
introduce a bosonic dimensionless variable:

x(z)  x (z)/(2) = q  i
where q = q/2 and a fermionic one:
(z) = ixt

0 log z + ixn6=0

tzt1/2

(3.70)

(3.71)

the theory can be quantized by imposing the following opes

x(z)x (w) =  log(z w) + ...; (z) (w) = 
where the dots denote nite terms for z  w. notice that these opes
coincide with the 2-points greens functions except for the ramond case
where the greens function is equal to:

w

+r w

z(cid:21) .

(3.73)

since, however, its singular behaviour when z  w is the same as in
eq.(3.72), we use the contractions in eqs.(3.72) for both the ns and the
r sector. in terms of the previous conformal elds we can dene the gen-
erators of superconformal transformations:

g(z) =

their mode expansion is given by:

2ii dzzn+1t (z)

;

gt =

2ii dzzt+1/2g(z) .

(3.75)

the conformal elds in eq.(3.74) satisfy the following opes:

+

(z  w)3 + ...

.

,

(3.76)

(3.77)

(3.78)

using eqs.(3.75) it is easy to see that the previous opes imply the super
virasoro algebra in eq.(2.54) for both the ns and the r sector. but then
the superconformal algebra that we get in the r sector diers from the
one given in eq.(2.55). however, as we have noticed in the previous section,
eq.(2.55) can be reduced to eq. (2.54) by translating l0 in the r sector in
eq.(2.55) by a constant:

l0  lconf

0

 l0 +

d
16

=

xn=1

(n  n + nn  n) + p2 +

d
16

(3.79)

therefore in the r sector we have two l0 operators that are related by
eq.(3.79). l0 determines the spectrum of superstring through eq.(2.56),
while lconf
that satises the algebra in eq.(2.54) encodes the correct con-
formal properties of the r sector.

in conformal eld theory one introduces the concept of conformal or
primary eld (z) with dimension h as the object that satises the following
ope with the energy-momentum tensor:

from it one can compute the corresponding highest weight state |i by
means of the following limiting procedure

zh0|(z2)h(z)

(3.81)

the hermitian conjugate eld  in the previous expression has been de-
ned as the eld transformed under the conformal transformation z  1/z
apart from possibly a phase factor. using the previous denition and the

14

paolo di vecchia and antonella liccardo

expression for l0 given in eq.(3.75), it is easy to see that, if the confor-
mal eld has conformal dimension h, then the corresponding state is an
eigenstate of l0 with eigenvalue h and it is annihilated by all the virasoro
operators with n > 0, namely

l0|i = h|i

;

ln|i = 0

.

(3.82)

in the bosonic case the physical conditions on the states given in eq.(2.27)
imply that the vertex operators of the bosonic string theory v(z) are
conformal elds with conformal dimension equal to 1. this insures that
the quantity dzv(z) is invariant under conformal transformations. in the
supersymmetric case the physical conditions in eq.(2.56) imply l0|physi =
1/2|physi in the ns-sector and l0|physi = 0 in the r-sector. therefore
the corresponding vertex operators are not conformal elds with conformal
dimension equal to 1 as in the bosonic string. on the other hand in the
case of the r sector we have seen that, in order to determine the correct
dimension of a vertex operator, we should use the operator lconf
that, for
d = 10, acts on the spinorial ground state |ai as follows

0

lconf

|ai =

5
8|ai ,

(3.83)

this does not help, however, to get a vertex operator that has dimension
equal to 1. in the case of superstring we will see that, in order to get the
correct physical vertex operators in both ns and r sectors, one must add
the contribution of the superghost degrees of freedom that will be discussed
later on. the r vacuum state |ai in eq.(3.83) can be written in terms of
the ns vacuum by introducing the spin eld operator sa(z) satisfying the
eq.:

lim
z0

sa(z)|0i = |ai ,

(3.84)

where |0i is the ns vacuum. thus from eq. (3.83) we see that the spin eld
sa(z), which maps the ns vacuum into the r one, must have confromal
dimension 5/8.

one can show that the spin eld sa(z) satises the following opes [8]:

(z)sa(w) = (z  w)1/2()absb(w) + ...
sa(w)sb(w) = (z  w)3/2()ab + ...
.

(3.85)

until now we have completely disregarded the analysis of the ghost and
superghost degrees of freedom that, however, must be included in a correct
lorentz covariant quantization of string theory. they arise from the ex-
ponentiation of the faddev-popov determinant that is obtained when the

d branes

15

string is quantized through the path-integral quantization. in particular
in the bosonic case, choosing the conformal gauge, one gets the following
ghost action [9]

sghosts z d2z[b c + c.c.]

,

(3.86)

where b and c are fermionic elds with conformal dimension equal respec-
tively to 2 and 1. the ghost system of the bosonic string is a particular
case of the fermionic bc system described in the appendix corresponding to
a screening charge q = 3 and a central charge of the virasoro operator
c = 26.
with the introduction of ghosts the string action in the conformal gauge
becomes invariant under the brst transformations and the physical states
are characterized by the fact that they are annihilated by the brst charge
that in the bosonic case is given by

q i dz

2i

jbrst (z) i dz

2i

c(z)(cid:20)t x(z) +

1
2

t bc(z)(cid:21) ,

(3.87)

where t x(z) = 1/2(x)2, and t bc is given in eq.(a.7) for  = 2. it can be
shown that q is nilpotent if the space-time dimension d = 26. the physical
states are annihilated by the brst charge

q|physi = 0

(3.88)

this implies that the vertex operators corresponding to the physical states
must satisfy the condition

[q,w(w)] =iw

2i

jbrst (z)w(w) = 0 ,

(3.89)

where [, ] means commutator ( = 1) [anticommutator ( = 1)] when
the vertex operator is a bosonic [fermionic] quantity. by using the ope it
can be shown that in the bosonic string the most general brst invariant
vertex operator has the following form

w(z) = c(z)v x

described in the appendix with  = 1,  = 3/2 and q = 2, corresponding
to a central charge of the virasoro algebra c = 11. the brst charge can be
conveniently dened by using a world-sheet supereld formulation where
one introduces

a vertex operator corresponding to a physical state must be brst invari-
ant, i.e.

before the introduction of ghosts and superghosts, the vertex operators for
the ns sector in the supereld formalism can be written as

[q,w(z)] = 0

(3.100)

v(z) = v0(z) + v1(z)

(3.101)

d branes

17

where v0 and v1 are two conformal elds with dimension 1/2 and 1 re-
spectively. for example in the massless ns sector the two elds are given
by
v0(z) =  (z)eikx(z)
but they are not brst invariant. in order to construct a brst invariant
version of the vertex v0(z) we must add the contribution of the ghosts and
superghosts. this can be easily done and one gets
w1(z) = c(z)e(z)v0(z)

; v1(z) = ( x(z) + ik   )eikx(z)

. (3.102)

(3.103)

in the case of the massless vertex in eq.(3.102) the vertex in eq.(3.103) is
brst invariant if k2 =   k = 0. we can proceed in an analogous way in
the r sector and obtain the following brst invariant vertex operator for
the massless fermionic state of open superstring [8]:

w1/2(z) = ua(k)c(z)sa(z)e 1
it is brst invariant if k2 = 0 and ua ()a
b k = 0. both vertices in
eqs.(3.103) and (3.104) have conformal dimension equal to zero as in the
case of the bosonic string (see eq.(3.90)).

2 (z)eikx(z)

(3.104)

in superstring, however, unlike the bosonic string, for each physical state
we can construct an innite tower of equivalent physical vertex operators
all (anti)commuting with the brst charge and characterized according to
their superghost picture p that is equal to the total ghost number of the
scalar eld  and of the  system that appear in the bosonization of the
 system (see the appendix for details):

p =i dz

2i

( + )

(3.105)

notice that the vertex in eq.(3.103) is in the picture 1, while the one
in eq.(3.104) is in the picture 1/2. vertex operators in dierent pictures
are related through the picture changing procedure that we are now going
to describe. starting from a brst invariant vertex wt in the picture t
(characterized by a value of p equal to t), where t is integer (half-integer)
in the ns (r) sector, one can construct another brst invariant vertex
operator wt+1 in the picture t + 1 through the following operation [8]
wt+1(w) = [q, 2(w)wt(w)] =iw
using the jacobi identity and the fact that q2 = 0 one can easily show
that the vertex wt+1(w) is brst invariant:
[q,wt+1] = 0

jbrst (z) 2(w)wt(w) .

dz
2i

(3.106)

(3.107)

18

paolo di vecchia and antonella liccardo

on the other hand the vertex wt+1(w) obtained through the construction
in eq.(3.106) is not brst trivial because the corresponding state contains
the zero mode 0 that is not contained in the hilbert space of the -
system (see eq.(a.27)). in conclusion all the vertices constructed through
the procedure given in eq.(3.106) are brst invariant and non trivial in
the sense that all give a non-vanishing result when inserted for instance in
a tree-diagram correlator provided that the total picture number is equal
to 2. using the picture changing procedure from the vertex operator in
eq.(3.103) we can construct the vertex operator in the 0 superghost picture
which is given by [10]

w0(z) = c(z)v1(z) 

1
2

(z)v0(z) .

(3.108)

analogously starting from the massless vertex in the r sector in eq.(3.104)
one can construct the corresponding vertex in an arbitrary superghost pic-
ture t.

in the closed string case the vertex operators are given by the product
of two vertex operators of the open string. thus for the massless ns-ns
sector in the superghost picture (1,1) we have
1(k/2, z)ev 

where v 
1 is equal to an analo-
gous expression in terms of the tilded modes. this vertex is brst invariant
if k2 = 0 and k = k = 0.

1(k/2, z) = c(z)(z)e(z)ei k

2 x(z) and ev 

w(1,1) = v 

in the r-r sector the vertex operator for massless states in the ( 1

1(k/2, z) ,

(3.109)

superghost picture is

w(1/2,1/2) =

22(m + 1)!

1/2(k/2, z)ev b

it is brst invariant if k2 = 0 and f1...m is a eld strength satisfying
both the maxwell equation (df = 0) and the bianchi identity (d f = 0).

the two weyl-majorana spinors ua and eub may have the same or opposite

chirality. in the rst case one obtains type iib theory while in the second
case one obtains the type iia theory. from eq.(3.111) one can see that the
only eld strengths which are allowed are those for (m+1) odd in iib theory

d branes

19

and those for (m + 1) even in iia theory. moreover, from eq.(3.111) one can
show that the eld strenghts with values of m related by hodge duality are
not independent and one can restrict oneself to the values (m + 1) = 1, 3, 5
in type iib and (m + 1) = 2, 4 in type iia string theory.

since the physical state corresponding to the symmetric vertex given in
eq.(3.110) cannot be used to compute its coupling with a d brane because
the boundary state that we will construct in sect. 7 is in an asymmetric
picture, in the following we will explicitly write the vertex operator of a
physical r-r state in the asymmetric picture (1/2,3/2). it is given
by [11]:

w(1/2,3/2) =

xm =0

where

am

22(cid:16)ca(m)m(cid:17)ab v a

1/2+m (k/2, z)ev b

2 x(z) (3.114)

2 m)e(z)ei k

2 ex(z)

(3.115)

it can be shown that the vertex operator in eq.(3.112) is brst invariant
if k2 = 0 and the following two conditions are satised

am =

(1)m (m +1)

[m !(m  1)!...1]2

,

da(m) = 0

.

(3.116)

by acting with the picture changing operator on the vertex in eq.(3.112)
it can be shown that one obtains the vertex in the symmetric picture in
eq.(3.110). in particular one can show that only the rst term in the sum in
eq.(3.112) reproduces the symmetric vertex, while all the other terms give
brst trivial contributions.

4. t-duality

the compactication of a dimension in string theory is characterised by
the appearance of new interesting phenomena with respect to those already
present in eld theory. in fact, in the case of a closed string, together with
the kaluza-klein (k-k) excitations, a new kind of states called winding
states appear in the spectrum. it turns out that the bosonic closed string

20

paolo di vecchia and antonella liccardo

theory is invariant under the exchange of the winding modes with the k-k
modes according to a transformation that is called t-duality. in the super-
symmetric case, instead, this transformation is in general not a symmetry
anymore but brings from a certain string theory to another string theory.
for instance t-duality along a certain direction acts interchanging the iia
with the iib theory. in the case of an open string, instead, this analysis
naturally leads to the existence of other objects called dp-branes.

let us discuss in some detail the compactication and the t-duality

invariance, starting with the bosonic closed string.

the most general solution of the eqs. of motion for the bosonic closed

string in eq.(2.3) can be written as:
x (, ) = q + 2 (

+is 

2 xn6=0(cid:18)

0 +e
e2in( ) + e

0 ) +

(4.117)

(4.118)

where the momentum of the string is given by

p =

1
2

0 ) .

(

0 +e

in the uncompactied case the two zero modes must be identied because
the string coordinate must be invariant under    + and the expression
for the momentum in eq.(4.118) reduces to the one obtained just after
eq.(2.13).

let us compactify one of the space dimensions along a circle with radius
r. this means that the string coordinate corresponding to this direction
that we denote for simplicity with x without any index must be periodically
identied as:

as in the point particle case, the conjugate momentum corresponding to
the compactied direction must be quantized as

x  x + 2r .

(4.119)

p =

n
r

with

n  z .

(4.120)

this is simply a consequence of the fact that the generator of the trans-
lations along the compact direction eipa must reduce to the identity for
a = 2r. moreover in the compactied case the string coordinate x must
be invariant under    +  apart from a factor 2rw (w is an integer)
as follows from eq.(4.119). this implies that

2 (0 e0) = 2wr

with

w  z ,

(4.121)

d branes

21

where w corresponds to the number of times that the closed string winds
around the compact direction.

eqs. (4.118) and (4.120) together with eq. (4.121) imply that the zero

modes for the compact direction must have the following expression

l0 =

and

the mass operator becomes

(4.125)

from the previous expression we see that the spectrum of the closed string
has been enriched by the appearance of two kinds of particles: the usual
k-k modes which contribute to the energy with n
r together with some new
excitations that are called winding modes because they can be thought of as
generated by the winding of the closed string around the compact direction
which in fact contributes to the energy of the system as

t 2rw =

wr


,

(4.126)

where t = 1/(2) is the string tension. all previous formulas can be
trivially generalized to the case of a toroidal compactied theory in which
more then one coordinate x  is compactied on circles with radii r(). of
course in this case we will have k-k and winding modes corresponding to
all the compactied directions.

from eq.(4.125) we see that the spectrum of the theory is invariant
under the exchange of kk modes with winding modes together with an
inversion of the radius of compactication:

w  n

;

r  r 


r

.

(4.127)

22

paolo di vecchia and antonella liccardo

this is called a t-duality transformation and r is the compactication
radius of the t-dual theory. it can also be shown that both the partition
function and the correlators are invariant under t-duality. this means that
t-duality is a symmetry of the bosonic closed string theory. as a conse-
quence of this invariance, whenever we have to consider compactied the-
ories, we can limit ourselves to the case r  . that is the reason why
 is often called the minimal length of the string theory.

substituting eq.(4.127) into eq.(4.122) we obtain the action of t-duality

on the zero modes

0  0

;

e0  e0 .

this transformation, however, changes the operators eln in eq.(2.17) and

then does not leave invariant the physical subspace. in order to keep the
physical subspace invariant we must extend the previous transformation
property to all the non-zero oscillators:

(4.128)

en  en

n  n

;

n  z .

(4.129)

this transformation leaves obviously also invariant the mass of the states
given in eq.(4.125).

eqs.(4.128) and (4.129) allow us to dene the action of t-duality directly

on the string coordinate x. in fact writing

x =

1
2

(x + x+) ,

(4.130)

where

and

x = q + 22(  )0 + i2xn6=0
x+ = q + 22( + )e0 + i2xn6=0 en

n

e2in( )

(4.131)

e2in( +)

,

(4.132)

we see from eqs. (4.128) and (4.129) that the t-dual coordinate x must
satisfy the conditions

 x   x = x

;

x   x =  x.

(4.133)

they are satised if the t-dual coordinate is equal to

x =

1
2

(x  x+) .

(4.134)

d branes

23

therefore the t-duality transformation acts on the right sector as a par-
ity operator changing sign of the right moving coordinate x+ and leaving
unchanged the left moving one x.

in an open string theory the string coordinate does not satisfy any pe-
riodicity requirement on . this implies that in its compactied version
there are only k-k modes, while the winding modes are absent. this could
suggest that t-duality is not a symmetry of the open string theory. such a
conclusion, however, leads to some problem when we remember that theo-
ries with open strings also contain closed strings. let us consider a theory
with open and closed strings with dp1 directions compactied on circles
with radii r and take the limit

r  0

 compact direction ,

(4.135)

in this limit the open string theory loses eectively d  p  1 directions
because all the k-k modes become innitely massive decoupling from the
spectrum and because there cannot be any open string oscillation along
the directions with zero radii. therefore in this limit the open string will
appear to only be living in a p + 1-dimensional subspace of the entire d-
dimensional target space. let us analyze what happens in the same limit
in the closed string sector. when the radii of the compact dimensions are
vanishing the k-k modes again decouple, while the winding modes will
appear as a continuum of states. this is a rst indication that for closed
strings the compact directions do not disappear from the theory as it hap-
pened for open strings! more precisely, in the closed string sector we can
perform a t-duality transformation, that is allowed because it is a sym-
metry of this sector, and in so doing we can completely restore all the d
space-time dimensions, as a consequence of the fact that in the limit in
eq.(4.135) the t-dual radii go to innity. but in this way we would end up
with a theory in which open strings live in a p + 1-dimensional subspace of
the entire space-time, while closed strings live in the entire d-dimensional
target space. this mismatch can be solved by requiring that, in the t-dual
picture, open string still can oscillate in d dimensions, while their endpoints
are xed on a p + 1-dimensional hyperplane that we call dp-brane. open
strings with their endpoints xed on these hyperplanes satisfy dirichlet
boundary conditions in the d  p  1 transverse directions. they are al-
lowed boundary conditions as we have already seen in eq.(2.8) although
they destroy the poincar`e invariance of the theory.

in conclusion, in order to avoid a dierent behaviour between the closed
and the open sector of a string theory, we must require that the action
of t-duality on an open string theory consists in transforming neumann
boundary conditions into dirichlet ones. this can, in fact, be very natu-
rally obtained if we extend the denition of the t-dual coordinate given

24

paolo di vecchia and antonella liccardo

in eq.(4.134) to the open string case. in this way we obtain the following
t-dual open string coordinate:

x  =

1

2hx

(4.136)

where now the left and right movers contain the same set of oscillators

x

and

0 + i2xn6=0

(4.138)

from eqs.(4.136), (4.137) and (4.138) one can immediately see that t-
duality has transformed a string coordinate satisfying neumann boundary

conditions and given by 1/2hx 

 + x 

+i into a t-dual one satisfying dirich-

let boundary conditions and given in eq.(4.136). of course it is also true
that, if we had started with a string coordinate satisfying dirichlet bound-
ary conditions we would have obtained a t-dual coordinate satisfying neu-
mann ones.

the fact that open strings satisfy dirichlet boundary conditions implies
the existence in the theory of objects, called the dp-branes, that are char-
acterized by the fact that open strings have their endpoints attached to
them. from the three previous equations it also follows that

x ()  x (0) = 2p = 

2n()
r() = 2n r()  x ()  x (0) ,
(4.139)
this means that in the t-dual theory the two endpoints of the open string
are attached to the same d-brane.

from the previous construction it also follows that each dp-brane can
be transformed into a dp-brane through an appropriate sequence of com-
pactications and t-duality transformations. in fact let us start with a
dp-brane embedded in a d-dimensional space-time and let us compactify
one of the space directions x  that lies in its world-volume on a circle with
radius r(). the action of a t-duality transformation on this coordinate
has the eect that an open string attached to the brane changes from neu-
mann to dirichlet boundary conditions in that direction. therefore, the
brane loses one longitudinal coordinate which becomes transverse and is
transformed into a d(p  1)-brane embedded into a space-time which has

d branes

25

the direction x  compactied on a circle of radius r() = /r(). to ob-
tain a d(p1)-brane living in the d-dimensional uncompactied space-time
we need to make the decompactication limit in the t-dual theory, namely

r()  , or equivalently r()  0 .

(4.140)

in the same way, if instead of compactifying one of the space-time directions
which are longitudinal to the dp-brane, we compactify one of the directions
transverse to the brane, and then we act with a t-duality transformation
on this coordinate we will get a d(p + 1)-brane embedded into a space-
time with one compact direction. then taking the limit in eq.(4.140) we
get again the uncompactied theory.

to conclude we observe that open strings satisfying neumann boundary
conditions in all the directions can be thought as being attached to a space-
lling brane that is a d25-brane in the bosonic string or a d9-brane in the
superstring. therefore, as a consequence of the previous discussion, starting
with a space-lling brane through a t-duality transformation we can obtain
an arbitrary dp-brane. more precisely, a dp-brane can be obtained from a
space-lling brane by rst compactifying d p 1 directions, then perform-
ing a t-duality transformation and nally taking the decompactication
limit.

up to now we have treated a dp-brane as a pure geometrical hyperplane
to which open strings are attached and we have completely disregarded the
excitations of the attached open strings. but we will see that, as soon as
we let them come into play, they provide dynamical degrees of freedom to
the dp-brane.

among all possible excitations of an open string the massless ones have
the peculiarity of not changing the energy of the dp-brane to which the
open string is attached. therefore from the brane point of view they can
be interpreted as collective coordinates of the brane.

in absence of chan-paton factors, the massless excitations of an open
string with neumann boundary conditions in all directions are described by
a d-dimensional abelian gauge potential a. from the previous discussion
it can be thought as a gauge eld living on the space-lling brane. then by
compactifying d = d p 1 dimensions and making a t-duality transfor-
mation in each of the compact directions, followed by a decompactication
limit in the t-dual theory, we see that the vector potential a splits in a
(p + 1)-dimensional vector a with   {0, ..., p} and d scalars elds. the
most natural interpretation of the t-dual version of the abelian gauge eld
is that the longitudinal coordinates a still describe a gauge eld living on
the dp-brane while the d scalars coming from the transverse components
a, with   {p + 1, ..., d  1}, appear as the transverse coordinates of the
dp-brane.

26

this interpretation becomes more clear as soon as we introduce a non-
abelian u (n ) gauge group in the open string theory through the chan-
paton factors and in addition we turn on wilson lines. the chan-paton
procedure for introducing non-abelian gauge degrees of freedom on an open
string consists in adding non-dynamical degrees of freedom at each of its
two endpoints. a generic string state will therefore be denoted with a ket
|, i, ji where  describes the usual degrees of freedom of a string, while the
indices i and j refer to the gauge degrees of freedom. in the case of a u (n )
gauge group i transforms according to the fundamental representation n ,
while j according to the complex conjugate representation n :

|ii = uii|ii

;

|ji = |jiu +
jj  .

if we now introduce a basis of n  n matrices a
state as
nxi,j=1|, i, jia

|, ai =

ij ,

ij, expand an open string

(4.141)

(4.142)

iju +

and use eq. (4.141) we see that the transformations in eq.(4.141) act on the
matrices a

ij as follows
a
ij  uiia
this means that the matrix a
ij transforms according to the adjoint repre-
sentation (n  n) of u (n ) which is in fact the appropriate representation
for a gauge eld.
let us now consider the eect of compactication in the presence of
chan-paton factors. for the sake of simplicity we compactify just one co-
ordinate that we denote with x without any index and turn on a pure
gauge eld of the form

jj  =(cid:0)u au +(cid:1)ij 

(4.143)

.

(a)ij =

1

2r

diag(1, ..., n ) .

(4.144)

this corresponds to a pure gauge conguration generated by the matrix:

u = diag(cid:18)eix 1

2r , ..., eix

n

2r(cid:19) ,

(4.145)

because the gauge eld conguration in eq.(4.144) can be written as

a = iu 1u .

(4.146)

but in the case of a compact coordinate the presence of a pure gauge eld
aects the parallel transport along the compact dimension and we get non-
zero wilson lines:

adx = diag(ei1 , ..., ein ) .

(4.147)

eir 2r

0

d branes

27

in particular the parallel transport around the compact coordinate trans-
forms |ii and |ji as follows

|ii  eii|ii

;

|ji  eij|ji ,

and therefore the open string state transforms as

|, ai =

nxi,j=1

ei(ij )|, i, jia
ij .

(4.148)

(4.149)

the presence of wilson lines changes the possible values of the momentum
of the state |, i, ji. in fact in this case a translation of 2r acts both on the
string and the gauge degrees of freedom that are located at its endpoints.
requiring that this combined action leaves the state invariant:

e2irpei(ij)|, i, ji = |, i, ji ,

we get that the momentum of the state, that we call p, is equal to

p =

n
r

+

(j  i)

2r

.

(4.150)

(4.151)

let us now see what are the consequences of the presence of wilson lines
in the t-dual theory. inserting eq.(4.151) in eq.(4.139) we get

x()  x(0) = (2n + j  i) r  (j  i) r .

(4.152)

this means that the open string is stretching between two dp-branes whose
coordinates are i r and j r. moreover remembering eq.(4.144) we imme-
diately see that

i r = 2(a)ii

;

j r = 2(a)jj .

(4.153)

and we can conclude that turning on u (n ) wilson lines in a theory of open
strings along a compactied direction corresponds, in the t-dual theory, to
introduce n dp-branes located respectively at

x1 = 2(a)11, ..., xn = 2(a)n n

(4.154)

in this way the transverse components of a u (n ) gauge eld carried by an
open string are correctly interpreted as the coordinates of n dp-branes.

in superstring theory the eect of t-duality on the bosonic coordinates
is exactly the same as discussed for the bosonic string, namely t-duality
acts as a parity transformation over the tilded sector

x =

(x + x+)  x =

this transformation propriety of the fermionic coordinates can also be un-
derstood as due to the requirement that the subspace of the physical states
of the superstring, dened by eqs.(2.56) and by the analogous ones for the
right sector, is left invariant by t-duality. therefore, looking at the struc-

ture of the operator egt given in eq.(2.48) and taking into account eq.(4.129),

we obtain again eq.(4.157).

5. classical solutions of the low-energy string eective action

in the previous sections we have seen that the requirement of invariance
under t-duality transformations in presence of open strings implies the
existence of p-dimensional objects called dp-branes to which open strings
can be attached determining their dynamics. although these objects are
required by t-duality their meaning is still rather obscure in the present
framework. on the other hand, following a completely dierent line of re-
search with the aim to get some non-perturbative information about string
theories some people were investigating classical solutions of the low-energy
string eective action. the underlying idea was in fact that, as the construc-
tion of t hooft-polyakov monopoles in non abelian gauge theories teaches
us many things about the non-perturbative structure of non-abelian gauge
theories, so from the study of classical solutions of the low-energy string
eective action one could learn a great deal on non-perturbative aspects of
string theories. it turns out that starting from the low-energy string eective
action one nds solutions of the classical equations of motion correspond-
ing to p-dimensional objects. in the following we just want to remind their
main properties.

the starting point is the low-energy string eective action containing
the graviton, the dilaton and only one n-form potential, that written in the
einstein frame is given by:

s =

22z ddxg(cid:20)r

()2

2(n + 1)!

ea (fn+1)2(cid:21) ,

(5.158)

where n = p + 1 and fn+1 = dc. for simplicity we have neglected all
fermionic elds and the other ns-ns and r-r elds. an electric dp-brane

d branes

29

corresponds to the following ansatz:

for the metric g, and

ds2 = [h(r)]2a(cid:16)dxdx(cid:17) + [h(r)]2b (ijdxidxj) ,
2[h(r)]1 ,

e(x) = [h(r)]

,

c01...p(x) = 

(5.159)

(5.160)

for the dilaton  and for the r-r (p + 1)-form potential c respectively. the
two signs in c correspond to the brane and the anti-brane case and h(r) is
assumed to be only a function of the square of the transverse coordinates
r = x2

 = xixi. if the parameters are chosen as

a = 

d  p  3
2(d  2)

, b =

p + 1
2(d  2)

with a obeying the equation

(5.161)

2(p + 1)(d  p  3)

d  2

+ a2 = 4 ,

(5.162)

then the function h(r) satises the at space laplace equation. an ex-
tremal p-brane solution is constructed by introducing in the right hand side
of the eqs. of motion following from the action in eq.(5.158) a -function
source term in the transverse directions. if we restrict ourselves to the sim-
plest case of just one p-brane, we obtain the following expression for h(r)

h(r) = 1 + 2tpg(r) ,

(5.163)

where

g(r) =

venient to introduce the quantity:

(5.168)

the fundamental observation made by polchinski [3] has been to identify
the dp-branes required by t-duality with the p-branes obtained as classi-
cal solutions of the low-energy string eective action. therefore, on the one
hand the p-branes are new non-perturbative states of string theory and on
the other hand have the important property that open string have their
endpoints attached on them. the latter property will allow one to compute
their interactions and more in general to study their properties by com-
puting open string one-loop diagrams. on the other hand we should not
be worried that the dirichlet boundary conditions break poincar`e invari-
ance because this happens in presence of any kind of solitonic state. in the
next chapter we will introduce the boundary state and we will show that
it provides a stringy description of these new states.

6. bosonic boundary state

as discussed in the previous section dp-branes are extended p dimensional
objects characterized by the fact that open strings can have their endpoints
attached to them. in general they are dynamical and non rigid objects, that
can uctuate in shape and on which external elds can live. in these lectures
we limit ourselves to treat them as static and rigid objects.

the open string with the endpoint at  = 0 attached to a dp-brane
satises the usual neumann boundary conditions along the directions lon-
gitudinal to the world volume of the brane

x |=0 = 0

 = 0, 1, ...., p ,

(6.169)

and dirichlet boundary conditions along the directions transverse to the
brane

i = p + 1, ....d  1 ,

(6.170)

x i|=0 = yi

where yi are the coordinates of the brane and d is the dimension of the
minkowski space-time, that in the case of the bosonic string is equal to
d = 26.

as the interaction between two superconducting plates is obtained by
computing the vacuum uctuation of the electromagnetic eld that gives
rise to the casimir eect, so the interaction between two dp-branes is given
by the vacuum uctuation of an open string that is stretching between
them. this means that their interaction is simply given by the one-loop

d branes

31

open string free-energy which is usually represented by the annulus or
equivalently by the cylinder diagram. from either of those two diagrams it
is easy to see that by exchanging the variables  and  the one-loop open
string amplitude can also be viewed as a tree diagram of a closed string
created from the vacuum, propagating for a while and then annihilating
again into the vacuum. these two equivalent descriptions of the same di-
agram are called respectively the open-channel and the closed-channel.
we want to stress that the physical content of the two descriptions is a
priori completely dierent. in the rst case we describe the interaction be-
tween two dp-branes as a one-loop amplitude of open strings, which is the
amplitude of a quantum theory of open strings, while in the second case
we describe the same interaction as a tree-level amplitude of closed strings,
which is instead a classical amplitude in a theory of closed strings. the fact
that these two descriptions are equivalent is a consequence of the confor-
mal symmetry of string theory that allows one to connect the two apriori
dierent descriptions.

to show that, let us consider a one-loop diagram with an open string
circulating in it and stretching between two parallel dp-branes with co-
ordinates respectively given by (yp+1, ..., yd1) and (wp+1, ..., wd1). the
open string satises the boundary conditions in eq.(6.169) both at  = 0
and  =  along the world-volume directions of the brane, while along the
transverse directions satises the following equations:

x i|=0 = yi

x i|= = wi

i = p + 1, ..., d  1 ,

(6.171)

where we take  and  in the two intervals   [0, ] and   [0, t ].
we now want to nd a conformal transformation acting on the previous
open string boundary conditions in order to transform them into the bound-
ary conditions for a closed string propagating between the two dp-branes.
in terms of the complex coordinate    + i, a conformal transforma-
tion simply transforms   f (), where f () is an arbitrary holomorphic
function of . let us consider the following conformal transformation

 =  + i  i =   i .

(6.172)
after the inversion    the previous conformal transformation simply
amounts to exchange  with  and viceversa
(,  )  (, ) .

(6.173)

finally in order to have the closed string variables  and  to vary in
the intervals   [0, ] and   [0, t ] corresponding to a closed string
propagating between the two d branes one must perform the following
conformal rescaling

(6.174)

32

paolo di vecchia and antonella liccardo

with t = 2/t. we have therefore constructed a conformal transformation
that brings us from the open string to the closed string channel. in the
closed string channel we need to construct the two boundary states |bxi
that describe the two dp-branes respectively at  = 0 and  = t . the
equations that characterize these states are obtained by applying the con-
formal transformation previously constructed to the boundary conditions
for the open string given in eqs.(6.169) and (6.171). at  = 0 we get the
following conditions:

 x | =0|bxi = 0

 = 0, ..., p ,

x i| =0|bxi = yi

i = p + 1, ..., d  1 .

analogous conditions can be obtained for the dp-brane at  = t .

(6.175)

(6.176)

the previous equations can be easily written in terms of the closed

string oscillators by making use of the expansion in eq.(2.13), obtaining

(

n +e

n)|bxi = 0 ;

(i
p|bxi = 0

n ei

n)|bxi = 0 n 6= 0
(qi  yi)|bxi = 0 .

introducing the matrix

s = (,ij ) ,

the equations for the non-zero modes can be rewritten as

the state satisfying the previous equations can easily be determined to be

 n 6= 0 .

e 1

n nsen!|0i|0ie|p = 0i ,

where np is a normalization constant to be xed.

the previous boundary state describes only the degrees of freedom cor-
responding to the string coordinate x. in order to have a brst invariant
boundary state we have to supplement it with the boundary state for the
ghost degrees of freedom obtaining the full boundary state

|bi = |bxi|bghi .

(6.181)

we will later on write the ghost part of the boundary state.

the overlap conditions for the conjugate boundary state can be easily
obtained by taking the adjoint of eqs. (6.177) and (6.179) and are given by

(6.183)

in the following we will compute the interaction between two parallel
dp-branes both in the open and in the closed string channel. by comparing
the two results we can determine the normalization factor np appearing in
the boundary state in eq.(6.180). let us start by computing the interaction
in the closed string channel. for the sake of simplicity we perform this
calculation considering only the part of the boundary state containing the
string coordinate x and then adding by hand the contribution of the ghosts.
with this simplication the free energy reads as

f = hbx|d|bxi ,
where d is the bosonic closed string propagator

d =

where d  dp1 and |y| is the distance between the two dp-branes. the
matrix element in the previous expression can be factorized in two parts
containing respectively the contribution of the zero and non-zero modes.
the contribution of the zero modes is given by:

y represents the distance between the two parallel dp-branes and k the
momentum lying along the world volume of the two branes. here the l0
operator diers from the one in eq. (2.24) because in this case the open
string satises dirichlet boundary conditions in the d  p  1 transverse
directions and neumann boundary conditions in the longitudinal ones.
the trace in eq.(6.198) must be understood as an integration over the

notice that also in this case we have introduced by hand the information
that the ghosts contribution amounts to change the exponent from d to

of the function f1 dened in eq.(6.197), the one-loop free-energy becomes

variable  = 1/t in eq.(6.207) and uses the modular transformation in
eq.(6.203).

notice that the function [f1]24 has the following expansion for large

value of the argument (x  ):

in the open string channel the nth term of the previous expansion cor-
responds to the contribution in the loop of open string states with mass
m 2 = n1, while in the closed string channel corresponds to the exchange
between the two branes of closed string states with mass 
2 m 2 = 2(n  1).
in particular from eq.(6.206) we can see that the dominant contribution to
f at large distance (y  ) comes from light closed string states:
f = vp+1(cid:16)82(cid:17) p+1

2 t (cid:16)e2t + 24 + . . .(cid:17) , (6.209)

2 z 

2 12e y2

where the rst term corresponds to the exchange between the two branes of
the closed string tachyon, the second term to the exchange of the massless
closed string states and the additional terms to the exchange of closed
string states with higher mass. the rst term is obviously divergent, but
it is due to the presence of the tachyon that will disappear in superstring.
the second term, that is called massless tadpole, can be cancelled if we add
the contribution of the non-orientable moebius diagram and we choose a
particular gauge group (so(213) for the bosonic string or so(32) for the
type i superstring). the requirement of tadpole cancellation is a convenient
way of xing the gauge group besides the one of anomaly cancellation. both
ways x the gauge group in the type i theory to be so(32).

in the eld theory limit (  0) it is more convenient to use the
expression for f written in the open string channel because in this case the
dominant contribution comes from the lowest open string states circulating
in the loop. this limit can be conveniently done by introducing in eq.(6.207)
the dimensional schwinger proper time s related to the modular parameter
 by the relation s =  . then using the expansion in eq.(6.208) we can
rewrite eq.(6.207) as follows:

f = vp+1(82) p+1

(6.210)

the rst term corresponds to the open string tachyon that will not be
present in superstring and the second term corresponds to the open-string
massless states. finally the additional terms correspond to states with
higher mass in open string theory that are negligible for   0. notice
that, if we neglect the tachyon contribution that is absent in superstring,
the massless states give a non vanishing contribution to f only if the dis-
tance between the two branes y  0..
as we have seen in eq.(6.181) the brst invariant boundary state is
the product of the boundary state |bxi for the bosonic coordinate, that
we have constructed in this section, and of |bghi that we are now going to
construct. brst invariance requires that the total boundary state satises
the equation

where the brst charge, given in eq.(3.87), is equal to

q is given by an analogous expression in terms of the tilded variables.
the overlap conditions in eq.(6.177) imply that the boundary state for the
bosonic coordinate satises the following eqs.:

m)|bxi = 0 .

(lx

m  elx

inserting the expression for q and the corresponding expression for q in
eq.(6.211) and using eq.(6.213) we can see that eq.(6.211) implies the fol-
lowing overlap conditions for the ghost boundary state

(cn +ecn)|bghi = 0

;

(bn ebn)|bghi = 0 .

the second overlap condition in the previous equation follows from the rst
one and from the analogous of eq.(6.213) for the ghost boundary state:

7. fermionic boundary state

in this section we want to generalize the previous construction to the super-
string case where, together with the boundary state |bxi corresponding to
the bosonic coordinate x that we have already constructed we also need to
determine the boundary state |bi corresponding to the fermionic coordi-
nate . the procedure that we follow for determining |bi is precisely the
same used in the previous section. we perform on the boundary conditions
for an open string stretching between two dp-branes the conformal trans-
formation that brings from the open string to the closed string channel. in
this way we obtain the equations that the fermionic boundary state must
satisfy. we then solve them nding the explicit expression for |bi.
let us consider the boundary conditions of an open superstring stretch-
ing between two dp-branes and circulating in the planar loop describing
the interaction between two parallel branes. if the bosonic degrees of free-
dom satisfy neumann boundary conditions in all the directions we have the
following boundary conditions for the fermionic coordinate:

(cid:26) (0,  ) = 1+(0,  )

(,  ) = 2+(,  )

(7.218)

where 1 and 2 can take the values 1. if 1 = 2 we get the ramond (r)
sector, while if 1 = 2 we get instead the neveu-schwarz (ns) sector.
in order to understand how they change when the bosonic coordinate
satises dirichlet boundary conditions in some of the directions, we com-
pactify them and apply t-duality. a t-duality transformation along a direc-
tion i of an open string theory transforms neumann into dirichlet boundary
conditions for the bosonic coordinate and, as discussed in sect. 4, changes
the sign of the fermionic coordinate in the right sector leaving that of the
left sector unchanged, i.e.

i
  i



i
+  i

+

(7.219)

therefore the boundary conditions in eq.(7.218) are generalized to the case
of an open superstring satisfying neumann boundary conditions in the
directions longitudinal to the world-volume of the dp-brane and dirichelet
boundary conditions in the transverse directions, as follows

(cid:26) 

(0,  ) = 1s

(,  ) = 2s

+
+

(0,  )
(,  )

(7.220)

where the matrix s has been dened in eq.(6.178).

but, together with the assignment of the usual boundary conditions that
connect the left and right modes at the endpoints of the open superstring,

40

paolo di vecchia and antonella liccardo

we must also give the periodicity or anti periodicity conditions for the
fermionic degrees of freedom in going around the loop. these are chosen to
be

(cid:26) (, 0) = 3(, t )

+(, 0) = 4+(, t )

(7.221)

where 3 and 4 can take the values 1. from the boundary conditions in
eqs.(7.220) and (7.221) we get


(0, 0) = 1s



+(0, 0) = 14s

+

(0, t )

(7.222)

and

(0, 0) = 3


(0, t ) = 31s

+

 (0, t )

(7.223)

but the two set of boundary conditions in eqs.(7.218) and (7.221) must be
consistent with each other. this implies 3 = 4.

let us now perform the conformal transformation given in eq.(6.172)
on the previous open string boundary conditions in order to pass to the
closed string channel. since the right and left fermionic coordinates  and
+ are two-dimensional conformal elds with conformal weight h = 1
2 with
respect to the their variables  and  respectively, then under the conformal
transformation

  f () = i

and

  f () = i

(7.224)

they transform as

()  

() =(cid:18) f ()

 (cid:19)1/2

( ) = (i)

(7.225)

and

+()  

+() =  f ()

  !1/2

+() = (i)

1

2 +( f ())

(7.226)

this implies that, performing the previous transformation on eq.(7.220), we
get a relative factor i between the right and left modes. more specically
from the boundary conditions given in eqs.(7.220) and (7.221) after the
conformal rescaling in eq.(6.174) we get

where we have explicitly put 4 = 3.

if we now compare the usual boundary conditions for the closed super-
string theory given in eqs. (2.39) and (2.40) with eq. (7.228) we see that, as
a consequence of the identity between 3 and 4, the fermionic boundary
state has only the r-r and the ns-ns sectors.

as for the bosonic coordinate the boundary state for the fermionic co-
ordinate at  = 0 is dened, from the rst equation in (7.227), as the state
that satises the equation:

(

(0, )  is



+(0, ))|b, i = 0

(7.229)

where  = 1. using the mode expansion given in eqs. (2.42) and (2.43)
we get the overlap conditions for the fermionic boundary state

(cid:16)
t(cid:17)|b, i = 0
e
t  is

(7.230)

where the index t is integer [half-integer] in the r-r [ns-ns] sector.

in the case of the ns-ns-sector the determination of the fermionic
boundary state satisfying eq.(7.230) is straightforward and leads to the
following expression:

|b, i = i

yr=1/2(cid:18)eirser(cid:19)|0i

(7.231)

in the r-r sector the boundary state has the same form as in the ns-ns
sector for what the non-zero modes is concerned, but with integer instead
of half-integer modes. we get therefore 4

|b, i = 

ym=1

eimsem|b, i(0)

(7.232)

where the zero mode contribution |b, i(0) must satisfy the condition

the previous equation is satised by the state

(cid:16)
0(cid:17)|b, i(0) = 0
e
0  is

|b, i(0) = mab|ai|ebi

4the unusual phases introduced in eqs. (7.231) and (7.232) will turn out to be con-
venient to study the couplings of the massless closed string states with a d-brane and to
nd the correspondence with the classical d-brane solutions obtained from supergravity.
note that these phases are instead irrelevant when one computes the interactions between
two d-branes.

notice that the previous overlap conditions for the conjugate boundary
state dier from those given in ref. [11] by the exchange   . our
choice of  corresponds to keep also in the closed channel the same 1, 2
appearing in the open string boundary conditions (see eq.(7.220)).

as in the bosonic string we must also in this case introduce a boundary
state for the reparametrization ghosts b, c. moreover we must also add the
boundary state for the superghosts , . the complete boundary state for
both the ns-ns and r-r sectors is given by:

|b, ir,n s =

tp
2 |bmat, i|bg, i

(7.241)

where

|bmati = |bxi|b, i

;

|bgi = |bghi|bsgh, i

(7.242)

d branes

43

the matter part of the boundary state consists of the boundary state for
the bosonic coordinate x given in eq.(6.180) without the normalization
factor np and of the one for the fermionic coordinate  given in eq.(7.231)
for the ns-ns sector and in eq.(7.232) for the r-r sector. the ghost part
|bgi contains the boundary state corresponding to the ghosts (b, c) given
in eq.(6.216) and the one corresponding to the superghosts (, ) that we
now want to determine.

it is not dicult to check that the identications (6.177) and (7.230)
imply that |bmat, i is annihilated by the following linear combinations of
left and right generators of the super virasoro algebra

paolo di vecchia and antonella liccardo

the overlap equations involving the ghost elds b and c can be solved
and one obtains the boundary state for the bc system given in eq.(6.216).
on the other hand the overlap equations for the superghosts determine the
superghost boundary state to be:

|bsgh, ins = exp(cid:20)i
in the ns sector in the picture (1,1) and

xr=1/2

(r rr r)(cid:21)|p = 1i| p = 1i , (7.251)

in the r sector in the (1/2,3/2) picture. the superscript (0) denotes
the zero-mode contribution that, if |p = 1/2i| p = 3/2i denotes the su-
perghost vacuum that is annihilated by 0 and 0, is given by [13]

|bsgh, i(0)

r = exphi0 0i |p = 1/2i| p = 3/2i .

the conjugate boundary state for the superghost is equal to

(mm  m m)(cid:21) (7.254)

in the r-r sector.

we would like to stress that the boundary states |bins,r are written
in a denite picture (p, p ) of the superghost system, where p is given in
eq.(3.105) and p = 2  p in order to soak up the anomaly in the su-
perghost number. in particular we have chosen p = 1 in the ns sector
and p = 1/2 in the r sector, even if other choices would have been in
principle possible [13]. since p is half-integer in the r sector, the bound-
ary state |bir has always p 6= p , and thus it can couple only to r-r
states in the asymmetric picture (p, p ). however, as we have seen in sec-
tion 3 the massless r-r states in the (1/2,3/2) picture contain a part
that is proportional to the r-r potentials [14], as opposed to the standard

d branes

45

massless r-r states in the symmetric picture (1/2,1/2) that are always
proportional to the r-r eld strengths.
the boundary state in eq.(7.241) depends on the two values of  = 1.
actually, as we will now show, we have to take a combination of the two
values of  corresponding to the gso projection. let us start with the ns
sector. in the ns-ns sector the gso projected boundary state is

|bins 

1 + (1)f +g

2

1 + (1)ef +eg

2

|b, +ins ,

(7.256)

where f and g are the fermion and superghost number operators

f =

xm=1/2

m  m  1 , g = 

xm=1/2

(mm + mm) .

(7.257)

their action on the boundary state corresponding to the fermionic coordi-
nate  and to the superghosts can easily be computed and one gets:

(1)f|b, i = |b,i
(1)g|bsgh, i = |bsgh,i

;

;

(1)ef|b, i = |b,i
(1)eg|bsgh, i = |bsgh,i

using the previous expressions after some simple algebra we get

|bins =

1

2(cid:16)|b, +ins  |b,ins(cid:17)

passing to the r-r sector the gso projected boundary state is

|bir 

1 + (1)p(1)f +g

|b, +ir .

where p is even for type iia and odd for type iib, and

and

one gets

8. classical solutions from boundary state

in this section we want to connect the boundary state introduced in the
previous sections to the dirichlet branes intended as electric r-r charged
p-brane solutions of the low-energy string eective action. in particular we
will show that the large distance behaviour of the graviton, dilaton and
r-r p + 1-form elds that one obtains from the boundary state exactly
agrees with that obtained from the classical solution in sect. 5.

the long distance behaviour of the classical massless elds generated by
a dp-brane can be determined by computing the projection of the boundary
state along the various elds after having inserted a closed string propaga-
tor. this amounts to compute the following matrix element

hpx|d|bi

(8.266)

where px runs over all the projectors of the closed superstring massless
sector listed in ref. [15], d is the propagator in eq.(6.185) if we perform
the calculation in the bosonic string or is given by

d =



4z d2z

|z|2 zl0a z

l0a

(8.267)

if we more correctly perform the calculation in superstring, where the con-
stant a = 1/2 in the ns-ns sector and a = 0 in the r-r sector.

let us start by computing the expression for the generic ns-ns massless

eld which is given by

j   1he0|1h0|

1/2 e

1/2|d|bin s = 

tp
2k2


vp+1s

(8.268)

1 e
massless closed string state he0|h0|

this equation is exactly the same of the one that one gets in the bosonic
string (except that in this case d = 10 and not d = 26) if we use the
propagator in eq.(6.185), the boundary state in eq.(6.180) and the bosonic
1 . because of this we keep the value
of the space-time dimension d arbitrary in such a way that our calculation
is valid in both cases. specing the dierent polarizations corresponding to
the various elds (see refs. [12, 15] for details) we get

(8.277)

for the r-r form potential.

the previous equations reproduce exactly the behavior for r   of
the metric in eq.(5.159) and of the r-r potential given in eq.(5.160). in
fact at large distance their uctuations around the background values are

48

paolo di vecchia and antonella liccardo

exactly equal to h and c01...p. in the case of the dilaton, in order to nd
agreement between the boundary state and the classical solution, we have to
take d = 10. this strongly suggests that, as expected, the calculation has to
be performed in superstring. as a matter of fact, a comparison between the
p-brane solution of the classical eqs. of motion that follow from the action
in (5.158) and a string calculation, does make sense only in the superstring
case where the graviton, dilaton and kalb-ramond eld come from the
ns-ns sector and the antisymmetric gauge potentials like c1...n from the
r-r sector. nonetheless, the bosonic case we have also considered in this
section already tells us what are the distinctive features of the boundary
state and how the long-distance behavior of the massless elds is encoded
in it.

9. interaction between a p and a p brane

in this section we study the static interaction between a dp-brane located
at y1, and a dp-brane located at y2, with n n  min{p, p} + 1 directions
common to the brane world-volumes, dd  min{d  p  1, d  p  1}
directions transverse to both, and  = (d n n  dd) directions of mixed
type. we will not consider instantonic d-branes, hence also n n  1. the
two d-branes simply interact via tree-level exchange of closed strings whose
propagator is

so that indicating with |b1i and |b2i the boundary states describing the
two d-branes the static amplitude is given by

where we have indicated with a and a(0) respectively the non zero mode
and the zero mode contribution in which the previous amplitude can be fac-
torized. we do not have any intercept as we had in eq.(6.185) for the bosonic

string because we assume that both l0 and el0 contain the ghost degrees of

freedom. the details of the computation of the quantity in eq.(9.279) can be
found in ref. [11]. here we just give the results of the various terms starting
from the non-zero modes. in the ns-ns sector after the gso projection we
get

the zero modes contribution in the ns-ns sector comes only from the
bosonic coordinate and can be obtained by following the same procedure
outlined in eqs.(6.187)-(6.190) for the bosonic string. also in this way one
gets eq.(6.190). if we insert the contributions in eqs.(9.280) and (6.190) in
eq.(9.279) we get the total ns-ns contribution to the interaction between
a dp and a dp brane

where vn n is the common world-volume of the two d-branes, |y| is the
transverse distance between them.
it is interesting to notice that the two terms in the square brackets of
eq. (9.285) come respectively from the ns-ns and the ns-ns(1)(f +g)
sectors of the exchanged closed string, which, under the transformation
t = 1/ , are mapped into the ns and r sectors of the open string suspended
between the branes. notice that ansns = 0 if  = 4.

the evaluation of the zero mode contribution in the r-r sector requires
more care due to the presence of zero modes both in the fermionic matter
elds and the bosonic superghosts. inserting eq. (9.281) into eq. (9.279) we
can write the total r-r contribution as

the alternating sum 11+1... if 12 = 1. this problem has already been
addressed in ref. [13] and solved by introducing a regularization scheme
for the pure neumann case (n n = 10). this method has been extended
to the most general case with d-branes in ref. [11]. here, we give the nal
result for the fermionic zero mode part of the r-r sector:

to the abstruse identity, the total d-brane amplitude

appendix a

in this appendix we will describe the properties of bosonic and fermionic
bc systems that enter in the covariant quantization of string theories. their
dynamics is described by the action

s[b, c] z d2z [b c + bc]

,

(a.1)

which implies the equations of motion

b = 0

;

c = 0 ,

(a.2)

and their conjugate ones. thus, the elds b and c are functions only of z
and they admit the following holomorphic expansions 5

b(z) =x bnzn

;

c(z) =x cnzn+1 .

(a.3)

where the variable n is integer for integer values of the conformal dimension
, while for half-integer values of  dierent spin structures are possible.
in particular for periodic boundary conditions (r-sector) n is integer while
for anti-periodic boundary conditions (ns-sector) n is half-integer. the
oscillators in eq. (a.3) satisfy the following hermiticity properties

c
n = cn

;

b
n = bn ,

(a.4)

where  = 1 for fermions and  = 1 for bosons.
relations that on the mode expansion in eq.(a.3) read as

the theory can be quantized by either requiring canonical commutation

[cn, bm] = n+m,0

;

[bn, bm] = [cn, cm] = 0 ,

where [ , ] means commutator [anticommutator] for bosonic [fermionic]
elds or by imposing the ope

b(z)c(w) =

(a.6)

the energy-momentum tensor t (z) and the ghost number current j(z) of
the theory are given by

t (z) =: [bc + (1  )bc] : =xn

5to avoid repetition, we write all denitions for the holomorphic sector of the theory

only; similar expressions hold for the antiholomorphic sector.

from the ghost number current we can obtain the ghost number j0 as

where the screening charge q and the c-number of the virasoro algebra
are respectively given by

q = (1  2)

,

c = (1  3q2) .

(a.16)

using eqs. (a.10) the opes given in eq. (a.15) imply the commutation
relations

[ln, jm] = mjn+m + q

(a.18)

[jn, jm] = nn+m,0 .

(a.19)
we observe that the q-dependent term in eq.(a.18) (or equivalently in the
second ope in eq.(a.15)), which makes the current j(w) not quite a good
conformal primary eld, is a consequence of the anomaly appearing in the
conservation law of the ghost number current [8]

(a.20)

where g and r(2) are respectively, the determinant of the metric and the
scalar curvature of the two dimensional world-sheet , on which the theory
is dened.

comparing the two equations obtained from (a.18) for n = m = 1
and n = m = 1 and using the hermiticity properties in eq.(a.11) we get
that j0 is neither hermitian nor antihermitian, but satises the following
property

(a.21)

(a.22)

j0 + j

0 + q = 0 .

let us introduce the q-vacuum, |q >, dened by the relations

bn|q > = 0
cn|q > = 0

if
if

n > q   ,
n  q +  .

then, from eq.(a.10) one can easily show that |q > is an eigenstate of both
j0 and l0 with eigenvalues given respectively by the following equations

j0|q >= q|q >

,

l0|q >=

1
2

q(q + q)|q > ,

and that, as a consequence of eq. (a.21), it is normalized as follows

< q|q >= (q + q + q)

(a.23)

(a.24)

54

paolo di vecchia and antonella liccardo

we observe that the state |q = 0 > is the only sl(2, r) invariant vacuum
since it is the only one which is annihilated simultaneously by l0, l1 and
l1.

because of eq.(a.24), in order not to get a vanishing result when we
compute correlation functions involving b and c, we must make sure that
the total ghost number of the correlator be equal q. for instance the
following correlation function

w(cid:19)q
<q  q|c(z)b(w)|q >=(cid:18) z

1

z  w

,

(a.25)

is dierent from zero. the contraction given in eq.(a.6) can be obtained
from the previous equation by choosing the sl(2, r) invariant vacuum
|q = 0i.
by using the mode expansion in eq.(a.3) and the anticommutation rela-
tions in eq. (a.5), or equivalently the contraction in eq.(a.6) together with
the wick theorem, one can very easily compute any correlation function of
b and c elds on the sphere.

a fermionic bc system can be bosonized in terms of a scalar eld with

a background charge q through the following relations
c(z) =: e(z) :

b(z) =: e(z) :

(a.26)

while a bosonic bc system can be bosonized in terms of a scalar eld 
with background charge q and a fermionic bc system with  = 1, that we
call  system, through the following relations

(z) = (z)e(z)

(z) = e(z)(z) .

notice that (z) satises exactly the same equation as the anomalous

(a.31)

the theory can be quantized by requiring the standard ope for a free
scalar eld, namely

(z)(w) =  log(z  w) .

(a.34)

where the central charge c of the virasoro algebra is equal to

the presence of a third-order pole in (a.34) is a signal of the fact that
j(z) is not really a good conformal eld of weight 1, when there is a non-
vanishing background charge q. notice that eqs. (a.33) - (a.35) reproduce
the ope given in eq. (a.15) except for the value of the central charge c.

the eld  admits the following expansion

(a.37)

where the harmonic oscillators satisfy the usual commutation relations

[n, m] = nn+m,0

[x, n ] =  .

(a.38)

using eq.(a.37) in eqs.(a.30) and (a.31), one can easily obtain the oscilla-
tor expressions for the virasoro generators ln and for the fourier compo-
nents jn of the current j(z), namely

jn = n ,

(a.39)

with 0 = n and where the symbol :
: is the usual normal ordering of
harmonic oscillators. the opes in eqs.(a.33), (a.34) and (a.35) are then
equivalent to the following commutation relations

[ln, lm] = (n  m)ln+m +

12

n(n2  1)n+m,0 ,

[ln, jm] = mjn+m  q

n(n + 1)n+m,0 ;

[jn, jm] = nn+m,0 .

(a.40)

as in the case of a bc system the zero mode of the fermionic number current
is not hermitian, but satises the following hermiticity properties

j0 + j

0 + q = 0 ,

(a.41)

which implies

< q | q >= (q + q + q) .

(a.42)
where |q > and |q > are eigenstates of n with eigenvalues q and q respec-
tively
due to the presence of the zero mode logarithmic term in eq.(a.37), the
eld (z) does not transform properly under a conformal transformation,
whereas : eq(z) : behaves as a primary conformal eld of weight 1
2 q(q +q).
in addition it transforms as a eld with charge q under the ghost number
current generated by j(z). this can be checked by computing the following
ope

t (z) : eq(w) :=

1
2

q(q + q)

: eq(w) :

(z  w)2 +

w : eq(w) :

(z  w)

,

(a.43)

j(z) : eq(w) := q

.

(a.44)

: eq(w) :

introducing the corresponding highest weight state according to

|q >= lim

z0

: eq(z) : |0 > ,

(a.45)

it is easy to see that |q > is an eigenstate of the ghost number j0 and of l0
with eigenvalues given respectively by

l0|q >=

1
2

q(q + q)|q >

,

j0|q >= q|q > .

(a.46)

if we consider the case  = 1 and we takes q = 1  2 we immediately see
that the central charge in eq. (a.36) reproduces exactly the one given in

d branes

57

eq. (a.16) and that the opes in eqs.(a.15) and in eqs.(a.33), (a.34) and
(a.35) are coincident. moreover if we consider eqs. (a.43) and (a.44) for
 = 1 and q = 12 and put q = 1 they reproduce eqs. (a.13) and (a.14)
respectively for b and c. this is consistent with the fact that a fermionic bc
system is completely equivalent to a scalar eld with a background charge
q = 1  2 and with  = 1. the elds b and c can be expressed in terms
of the scalar eld through the bosonization eqs.(a.26) and the current j(z)
in eq.(a.31) turns out to be the bosonized version of the fermionic number
current in eq.(a.8). consequently the zero mode n in eq.(a.37) is just the
bosonized version of the fermionic number, as one can see from

n =i dzj(z) = j0 .

(a.47)

in the case of a bosonic bc system the central charge of the virasoro algebra
in eq.(a.16) can be written as:

c = 1 + 3q2 = (1 + 3q2)  2 ,

(a.48)

that corresponds to the sum of the central charges of a scalar eld with
 = 1 given by c = 1 + 3q2 and of a fermionic bc system with  = 1 given
by c = 2. in this case the bosonization rules are given in eqs.(a.27).
introducing the new energy momentum tensor as

t (z) = t(z) + t(z)

(a.49)
where t is given in eq. (a.30) for  = 1, q = (1 + 2) and t is given
in eq. (a.7) for  = 1 and  = 1, it is easy to verify that the elds in the
r.h.s. of eqs.(a.27) have exactly the same conformal weights of a bosonic
(b, c) system. moreover, if we introduce the sum of u (1) number currents
of the scalar eld  and of the fermionic ,  system:

;

j(z) = j(z) + j(z) = (z) + (z)(z) ,

(a.50)

it is easy to verify that the ope of j(z) with (z) and (z) has no simple
pole term implying that both (z) and (z) have charge zero with respect
to the total u (1) number given by

p = (j0) + (j0) =i dz

2i

( +  )

(a.51)

on the other hand the u (1) current for the bosonic b, c system given in
eq.(a.12) is instead reproduced in the bosonized system by only the term
(j0) in eq.(a.51).
