orbifold point global orbifold point. is, global cover removes singularity. orbifold points moduli space need global. would like consider appearance local orbifold points obstruction duality groups. course one may want declare case covering orbifold point. one free one ends weaker notion duality groups. typical case however weak duality group probably trivial particularly useful notion. duality insist orbifold points global smooth. thanks berger-simons theorem (see example chapter 10 {$9502072$}) knowing holonomy manifold lead considerable knowledge structure. holonomy (on levi-civita

computation section 3 shows case least one example. 4.2 consequences shown one considers heterotic string compactied k3t 2 particular way factor moduli space relevant torus quotient physically meaningful smooth space parameters t-duality group. particular completely meaningless statement say kind r 1/r symmetry circles within torus. nonzero value string coupling constant torus (and therefore circle) obeys t-duality relationship generic calabiyau threefold. meaninglessness t-duality calabiyaus discussed {$9404060$}. question immediately raises following. one may begin labelling points moduli space size values near large radius limit extend process entire moduli space. usually lead minimum size. real meaning attached sizes value. t-duality fails heterotic string k3t 2 also fail circle ? one might argue string circle radius r exactly thing string circle radius 1/r compactication k3s1 also yield identical physics. leads three possibilities: 1. t-duality fails string circle. is, r 1/r symmetry totally wrong nonperturbative corrections taken account. would seem unlikely. string single circle self-dual radius really see unbroken su(2) gauge symmetry signaling identication moduli space. su(2) broken quantum eects consider k3t 2. holonomy arguments also show lot supersymmetry implies t-duality. suggest therefore t-duality symmetry string circle itself. 14 2. heterotic/type ii duality wrong. really want t-duality respected exactly strings need sacrice duality used paper. one free this. know enough string theory prove heterotic/type ii duality. one really wedded idea t-duality sacrice one might willing make. 3. string doesnt know compactications. one says one understands string theory compactied space, understanding ever include compactication? compactication includes putting dierent boundary conditions elds lived space. particular one may break supersymmetry. reasoning r 1/r symmetry circle implies t-duality compactication wrong. last possibility would appear reasonable. implies r 1/r symmetry circle depends context circle. argument uses t-duality circle torus embedded complicated situation cannot necessarily considered rigorous.
